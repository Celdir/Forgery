WHITE REVISION: 7/7/98

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)

Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.

JIM (O.S.)

Yeah, I'm the best, baby.

JIM (O.S.)(CONT'D)

...oh -- that was a tit, tits...

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)

Give it to me!  Yes!

JIM

Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)

Don't you love my sexy body?!

JIM

I do, baby, I do.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)

You're so big!

JIM

Yeah, that's right.

PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)

(deep macho voice)

Ohhh, tell me you're a nasty girl!

PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)(CONT'D)

Yeahhh, you been bad, real bad!

JIM

Man, shut up!

JIM'S MOM

Hey, Jimmy.  I just wanted to say

sweet dreams.

JIM

Yep, okay Mom, 'night.

JIM'S MOM

(leans in to Jim)

Kiss goodnight.

JIM'S MOM (CONT'D)

Is something wrong with the reception?

JIM

Yeah.  Damn cable.  There's this

nature show that I'm trying to watch.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)

Fuck me!  Yes!

JIM

Uh...

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)

BLOW YOUR WAD ON MY TITS!!

JIM

(choking)

Must...be...broken...

JIM'S DAD

What the heck is this?

JIM

Nothing!

JIM'S MOM

I think he's trying to watch one of

the illegal channels.

JIM

Jesus, Mom!  They're not

illegal

!

They're

pay

channels.  How could a

television channel be illegal?!  God,

get a clue!

JIM'S DAD

James, don't speak that way to your

mother!

PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)

Play with my hairy balls!

JIM'S DAD

Turn that garbage off!  Give me that!

JIM'S MOM

Oh my God!

JIM'S DAD

Honey, why don't you let me handle this

one.

JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)

Jesus Christ.  The dictionary?  Hell,

son, I'll buy you some dirty

magazines.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)

Oooh, spank me, daddy, spank me!

KEVIN

It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.

You got in.

VICKY

You think so?

KEVIN

"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but

after keeping you on the wait list for

the past couple months, we've decided

you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a

100-page, full-color brochure on how

rejected you are."

VICKY

Kevin, this is serious!

KEVIN

You got in.

VICKY

I love you!

OZ

Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's

any channel that should be illegal,

it's whatever that women's channel is.

Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some

shit.

JIM

Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little

Mermaid on TV the other night?  That

Ariel, whew.

OZ

She's a mermaid, dude.

JIM

(trumping him)

Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.

OZ

She's a

cartoon

, dude.

JIM

A

hot

cartoon.

OZ

Is there anything you don't jerk off

to?

JIM

C-Span?

KEVIN

Then she said -- she loves me.

OZ

Oh shit dude, the L-word!

JIM

And you said...

KEVIN

Nothing, I just hugged her back.

JIM

You think she was serious?

KEVIN

I couldn't tell -- She could've meant

like, "I love you grandma" or "I love

you Vanderbilt."

OZ

Just don't bring it up, hang low,

maybe she won't mention it again.

MICHELLE

And what we should do today, in band?

Instead of playing our instruments

regularly?  We should play them

backwards!  That'll be so funny!

OZ

(to Jim)

You guys got the Latin homework?

JIM

No -- Kevin, you?

KEVIN

(offended)

Please.

(then)

We're all golden, we're college bound.

I figured it out -- I can get a c-

minus in every class, and it's not

gonna make a difference.  U of M, here

I come.

VICKY

Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.

JESSICA

Yeah right.

VICKY

What?  We both have cars.

JESSICA

Yeah but, no offense, you're talking

about a post-high school, long-

distance relationship, and you and

Kevin haven't even done it yet.

VICKY

That's not why we're going out.

JESSICA

What the hell are you expecting him to

drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and

cookies?

VICKY

Jessica!  He'll drive there for me,

and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him.

We're going to have sex when he's

ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be

completely perfect.  I want the right

place, the right time, the right

moment.

JESSICA

Vicky, it's not a space shuttle

launch, it's sex.  So did you do the

physics write-up?

VICKY

(offended, a la Kevin)

Please.

JIM

There's our man.

KEVIN

Finch, you got the Latin homework?

FINCH

Non habeo.  Canis meus id comedit.

KEVIN

Whatever.

STIFLER

(yelling)

NOVA!!

OZ

Stifler!!

STIFLER

You coming to party tonight,

Ostreicher, ya fuckface?

OZ

Depends if my date wants to stop by.

STIFLER

That junior chick?

OZ

Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm

working on something new.

STIFLER

Yeah right.  I got an idea for

something new.  How 'bout you guys

actually locate your dicks, remove the

shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.

OZ

Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a

college chick!

STIFLER

Bullshit.  From where?

OZ

She works part-time at my dad's store.

STIFLER

Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like

your dad works at

her

store.

OZ

Dude, he does not.

KEVIN

Really, Stifler.  He's the manager.

STIFLER

Hey, man, I'm not making fun.  I'm

fuckin' impressed.  I mean, "Footlong

or six-inch, white or wheat," that's

some serious shit to master.

KEVIN

(half-joking)

Stifler, you're such an asshole.

STIFLER

Meyers, what's the deal with you and

Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out

since Homecoming and all she'll do is

blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a

steaming turd.

FINCH

Do you commonly grasp warm pieces of

stool?

STIFLER

(momentarily puzzled)

I do when I'm throwing them at your

mom, you damn freak.

(then)

Alright then, see you guys tonight.

I'll look for you in the No Fucking

section.

KEVIN'S BROTHER

You called me to ask me how to get laid?

KEVIN

What was I gonna do, call dad?  I

don't even know his number.

KEVIN'S BROTHER

Just dial 976-Asshole.

KEVIN

Yeah, well anyway...I thought you

might have some advice, brother to

brother.  I mean, I think tonight she

might, we might really, there's a

chance that -- you know.

KEVIN'S BROTHER

Have you ever heard of the bible?

KEVIN

What?  Not

the

Bible?

KEVIN'S BROTHER

Well, that's not really the name, but

we always called it that.

KEVIN

Does it tell me how to get laid?

KEVIN'S BROTHER

You know what, nevermind.  You're not

ready.

KEVIN

Ready for what?

KEVIN'S BROTHER

Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck

at that party.

KEVIN

You ever hear of something called The

Bible?

OZ

Once, in church, dude.

JIM

Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive

SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind

seeks outgoing companion."

Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.

OZ

"Fun loving" -- insane.

KEVIN

Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind,"

equals old.

JIM

No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is

really

old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.

FINCH

Perhaps you should consider actually

answering an ad.

JIM

Finch, you can be the one to date a

nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your

damn imitation hot dog.

FINCH

("for the hundredth time")

This is no imitation.  Removing the

hot dog from the Ultradog yields a

better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no

dog.

KEVIN

(checks his watch)

Alright...I'm shooting for a nine

o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five

after.

JIM

You can crash at Stifler's?

KEVIN

It's all good.

(He pulls out some gum)

Breath check.

OZ

(repulsed)

Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.

KEVIN

You got something up your sleeve for

tonight, Finch?

FINCH

A foolproof plan, my friend.  You

shall see.

OZ

(sings along)

And little hurly-burly came by in her

curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed

I ri-hide --

KEVIN

How the hell do you know all these

random songs?

OZ

It's early Springsteen, dude, this is

classic.  This was before the cheesy

remake.

JIM

This was remade?  Into what?

OZ

(chiming in as the chorus hits)

Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose

like a deuce, another runner in the

night, blinded...

KEVIN

At least now I know what the hell

they're saying.

JIM

So, does my hair look better --

(flips a small lock of hair

onto his forehead)

like this, or...

(flips it back up)

like this?

OZ

Who cares?

JIM

Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian

chick, she might be there tonight.

Now, do you think she'd prefer --

(flips hair down again)

Cool Hip Jim...

(flips it back up)

or Laid Back Jim?

KEVIN

The difference is so phenomenal, I

can't decide.

JIM

What about you?  You're the one with

the girlfriend and you're still

stranded on third base.

KEVIN

You know, I've never got that shit.

What exactly constitutes third base?

OZ

(holds up a couple fingers)

Contact, dude.

KEVIN

Then where does a blowjob figure in?

OZ

Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it

to third, and you're out.

JIM

So let's say you get there...what's

uh, third base feel like?

KEVIN

Oh, man, that's kind of sad.

OZ

Feels like warm apple pie, dude.

JIM

Apple pie...

(then)

McDonald's or homemade?

FINCH

Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia.

SHERMAN

What's up, fellas?

JIM

Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.

SHERMAN

Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys.

Confidence is high, repeat, confidence

is high.

Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full

strategic arsenal ready for

deployment.

JIM

You've got something going?

SHERMAN

Did you see that Central chick?

Brunette?

KEVIN/JIM

No.

SHERMAN

She's around.  Seems that she's taken

a liking to me.  Fellas, it's time

that she experienced -- The

Sherminator.

KEVIN

Yeah, okay Sherman, whatever.

SHERMAN

I'm a sophisticated sex robot, sent

back through time...to change the

future for one lucky lady.

KEVIN

Yeah man, right on!

KEVIN (CONT'D)

(shakes his head)

Hopeless.

JIM

Oh, shit!  There she is.  Nadia.

VICKY

You like her?  Her sponsor family

lives on my block.  Why don't you talk

to her?

JIM

What would I say?

VICKY

Just tell her what's on your mind.

And smile, you've got a good smile.

(then to Kevin)

Come on.

KEVIN

(to Jim)

Gotta go.

JIM

But --

JIM (cont'd)

Kevin, get back here!

NADIA

(with a really sexy accent)

You are in my English class, no?

JIM

(barely)

Yes.

NADIA

I thought so.

NADIA (cont'd)

So you are having fun?

NADIA (cont'd)

I said, you are having fun?

NADIA (cont'd)

Me too.

NADIA (cont'd)

Well...I am going to get another beer.

You want one?

JIM

No...you...go...ahead.

NADIA

Okay.

JIM

Oh, shit.  No!  Shit!

MICHELLE

We're here for the party?

STIFLER

What party?  There's no party.

PARTY GUY (O.S.)

Stiff-lerrr!  Par-tyyy!!

STIFLER

Try the house down the street.

BAND DORK

Ring the bell again.

MICHELLE

Ringing the bell is dorky -- let's

just go in.

VICKY

Oh, Kev.

KEVIN

Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's

time for us to take the next step in

our relationship?

VICKY

Tonight?

KEVIN

Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.

Isn't this how you've always pictured

it?

PARTY GUY (O.S.)

(yelling)

Dude, my farts fuckin' stink!

PARTY GUY #2 (O.S.)

You reek like a fuckin' Yeti, dude!

Go take a shit or something!

KEVIN

Or not.

VICKY

Just relax.

OZ

Great evening, isn't it?

COLLEGE CHICK

Sure.

OZ

There's something about the spring

that's just cool.  Like the smell of

fresh rain or something.

OZ (CONT'D)

Suck me, beautiful.

COLLEGE CHICK

What did you just say?

OZ

(not so confidently)

Suck me...beautiful?

COLLEGE CHICK

What?!

OZ

Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova

-- as in Casanova.

COLLEGE CHICK

You need some work, buddy!

OZ

Well...jeez, don't laugh at me.

COLLEGE CHICK

Look, Chris.  There are just some

things you need to learn, that's all.

OZ

Like what?

COLLEGE CHICK

Alright, well...you've got to tone it

down.  You don't need to go to Lookout

Point and spout cheeseball lines to be

romantic.

OZ

...okay...

COLLEGE CHICK

You have to pay attention to a girl.

Be sensitive to her feelings.

Relationships are reciprocal.

OZ

I'm not good in math.

COLLEGE CHICK

Come on, I'll drop you off at your

friends'.

STIFLER

(hysterical, toppling over)

You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!

OZ

Shut the fuck up.

JIM

Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.

OZ

Oh that's really reassuring.  And

don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a

fraud.

STIFLER

This is pathetic.  I'm gonna find me a

little hottie.

STIFLER (O.S.)(cont'd)

(yelling)

Suck me, beautiful!

VICKY

(brief pause)

Let me know.

KEVIN

Okay, don't stop.

KEVIN (cont'd)

Oh -- Now!

GUY #1

There we go.

STIFLER

SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!

KEVIN

God dammit, Stifler!

STIFLER

Check-out time!  Please vacate the

room.

VICKY

Stifler, you're such a jerk.

KEVIN

Vicky, wait!

SOPHOMORE CHICK

God, I can't believe there are so many

cool people at this party.

STIFLER

Yep.

SOPHOMORE

And you got a keg, too, wow.

(realizing)

Oh, wait, I left my beer downstairs.

STIFLER

Here, babe.

SOPHOMORE CHICK

Thanks.

STIFLER

(gazing into her eyes)

You're really beautiful.

SOPHOMORE CHICK

Really?

STIFLER

Uh huh.

SOPHOMORE CHICK

I don't know if I want to be doing

this.

STIFLER

(sighs)

Doing what?

SOPHOMORE CHICK

You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow

I'll just be some girl you go telling

all your friends about.

STIFLER

(shifty)

No way.

SOPHOMORE CHICK

(a little angry)

Steve!  You could at least look at me

when you say that.

STIFLER

Look...

(searching, remembers)

...Sarah.  I wouldn't go telling

stories or whatever about you.  I

promise.

JIM

What the hell?  I should be able to

talk to chicks.  I'm articulate.  I

got a 720 on my SAT verbal.

(starts listing off words)

Copious.  Verisimilitude.

JIM (CONT'D)

(unaffected)

Intransigence.

JIM (CONT'D)

Regurgitation.

GUY #1

Oh, gross.

JIM

Jesus, what did you eat?

KEVIN

Stifler, how's the man chowder?!

VICKY

He likes it.

JESSICA

Of course he does.  What about you?

Have you just never had one with Kevin

-- or have you never had one, period?

VICKY

I think I've had one.

JESSICA

Well that's a no.  No wonder you're

not psyched about sex.

(starts filling Vicky's beer)

You've never even had one manually?

VICKY

...I've never tried it.

JESSICA

Are you kidding?  You've never double-

clicked your mouse?

JESSICA (CONT'D)

Hell, just a pair of tight pants will

set me off.

(noticing Nadia next to them,

she passes the tap along)

Am I right or what, Nadia?

NADIA

(no bones about it)

You are right.  The hands are not

always necessary.

JESSICA

(to Vicky)

See?

NADIA

In fact -- I should teach you my own

special method.  I developed it myself

at the ballet institute in Prague.

You use nothing but the muscles of the

inner thigh.

JESSICA

No wonder she never pays attention in

class.

JIM

Shit, I can't believe a fine woman

like this produced a guy like Stifler.

FRESHMAN GUY

Dude!  That chick -- is a MILF!

FRESHMAN GUY #2

What the hell is that?

FRESHMAN GUY

M-I-L-F!  Mom I'd Like to Fuck!

SHERMAN

(hushed, to guys)

Don't you think you fellas could try a

little tact?  I've got company.  Know

what I mean?

KEVIN

(snapping)

Dammit!  If Sherman has sex before I

do, I'm gonna be really fucking

pissed.

KEVIN

Man, I just gotta get laid already!

This blowjob thing is bullshit!

VICKY

Jessica, can you drive me home?

JESSICA

Sure.

KEVIN

Vicky, wait.

VICKY

Not for you.

PARTY GUY (O.S.)

Yeti!  I am the Yeti!

KEVIN

Ow, what the hell?

JIM

Sorry, I thought you were dead.

FINCH

Good morning gentleman.

JIM

Finch!  Where were you last night?

What happened to the foolproof plan?

FINCH

I thought a fashionably late entrance

would enhance my appearance.

(off their looks)

When I got here, the Bacchanalia was

over and the nymphs had left.

KEVIN

Feeling better, Oz?

OZ

I'm such a loser.

KEVIN

That's the spirit.

SHERMAN

(snippets of conversation)

...I'll never forget...thank you.

CENTRAL GIRL

Bye.

JIM

You did it.

SHERMAN

Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman,

the boy.  I am now a man.

SHERMAN (CONT'D)

I highly recommend you join the club.

KEVIN

I -- I don't get it, how the hell did

you do that?

SHERMAN

It was just my time, fellas, it was

just my time.  Best of luck to you,

boys.

KEVIN

I put in months of quality time with

Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one

night and scores?  This is just wrong.

OZ

No shit, I'm never gonna get laid.

How the hell am I gonna become this

Mr. Sensitive Man?

JIM

Jesus, we're all gonna go to college

as virgins.  They've probably got

special dorms for people like us.

KEVIN

Alright, I got an idea.  But it stays

between us.  Agreed?

KEVIN (cont'd)

Okay.  It's really simple.  We

make an agreement -- no wait, more

than an agreement.

JIM

Like a bet?

KEVIN

No, a

pact

.  No money involved.  This

is more important than any bet.  Now

here's the deal: We all get laid

before we graduate.

OZ

Dude, it's not like I haven't been

trying to get laid.

KEVIN

This is different.  This is better.

Think of when you're working out, Oz.

You need a partner, someone to spot

you.  Someone to keep you motivated.

KEVIN (CONT'D)

That's what we are, we keep each other

on track.  Prior to this day, we've

postured.  We've procrastinated.

We've pretended.  We've -- well I

can't think of other p-words, but

we've probably done them too.

JIM

Pontificated.

KEVIN

(ignoring him)

Separately, we are flawed and

vulnerable.  But together, we are the

masters of our sexual destiny!

JIM

(kung fu voice)

Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong;

but our dragon style will defeat it!

OZ

(going on)

The Sha-lin masters from east and west

must unite!

KEVIN

Guys, guys -- you're ruining my

fucking moment here.  Now think about

it --

KEVIN (CONT'D)

No longer will our penises remain

flaccid and unused!  From now on, we

fight for every man out there who

isn't getting laid when he should be!

This is our day!  This is our time!

And, by God, we're not gonna let

history condemn us to celibacy!  We

will

make a stand!  We

will

succeed!

We will get laid

!

STIFLER

(wandering down from upstairs)

What the hell are you losers doing?

FINCH

If I might ask, when you brush your

teeth, do you spit or swallow?

KEVIN

Now, the sex -- it's got to be valid,

consensual sex.  No funny stuff.  And

no prostitutes, if you were thinking

about that, Finch.

KEVIN (CONT'D)

So, I'm thinking prom is basically our

last big chance.

OZ

Dude, prom sucks.

KEVIN

I know, but think about it -- At the

parties that night.  Chicks are gonna

want to do it.

JIM

Yeah, it's like tradition or

something.

KEVIN

Right.  That gives us...

JIM

Exactly three weeks to the day.

KEVIN

Alright then.  It's official.  Any

questions?

KEVIN (cont'd)

To the next step.

ALL

To the next step.

JIM

(shoving the rubbers into his

night table)

Just a minute!

JIM'S DAD

(trying not to look inside)

Can I come in?

JIM

Yeah, sure.

JIM'S DAD

You're not...busy?

JIM

Dad, come in.

JIM'S DAD

(fatherly attempt)

Sit down, Jim.  Let's talk.

JIM

Okay.

JIM'S DAD

These are for you.  From father to

son.

JIM

Uh...dad...

JIM'S DAD

Go ahead son, there's more.

JIM'S DAD (cont'd)

Now, that one's a little more...a

little more...graphic.

JIM

I know, Dad.

JIM'S DAD

Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.

JIM'S DAD (cont'd)

This, son, is your more exotic dirty

magazine.

JIM

Dad!  I know!

JIM'S DAD

Do you know about the clitoris?

JIM

(through clenched teeth)

Yes dad.

JIM'S DAD

Sometimes it can be pretty hard to

locate.

JIM

(interrupting, hand up)

Thank you, dad, I got it.

JIM'S DAD

Okay, well that about covers it.

JIM'S DAD (cont'd)

Now, let's put these somewhere where

your mother won't find them.

JIM

Wait!

JIM'S DAD

(beaten)

I'll have to save this speech for

another day.  I'm too worn out.

KEVIN

Did you get the flowers?

(no response)

What about the poem?

KEVIN (cont'd)

Vicky, please don't do this.

VICKY

I'll think about it.

JESSICA

Ah, you'll get her back soon enough.

That's easy, she likes you.  What you

need to do is learn to press a girl's

buttons.  You gotta give her what

she's never had.

KEVIN

What?

JESSICA

I'll give you a hint.

(hot, orgasmic)

"Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"

(flat)

Comprende?

KEVIN

You mean...and orgasm?

JESSICA

You got it, stud.

KEVIN

Well...I'm pretty sure I've --

JESSICA

(interrupts authoritatively)

No you haven't.

KEVIN

But that one time --

JESSICA

(shaking head)

No.

KEVIN

Well of course I'd want to give her

that.  I mean, what do you think, I

don't care about her?

JESSICA

Do you?

KEVIN

Of course.

JESSICA

Do you love her?

KEVIN

I -- I don't know, you can't ask me

that.

JESSICA

Well, if you want to get her in the

sack, tell her you love her.  That's

how I was duped.

KEVIN

I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If

I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.

JESSICA

Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or

the Big O.

STIFLER

Dickhead!  You gotta see this.

JIM

This is unexpected.

STIFLER

What did you cocks do to him?  Shit,

if Coach Marshall sees this, he'll

kick Oz off the team on principle

alone.

OZ

Hey guys, you came to watch me in

action?

JIM

Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.

STIFLER

I think you need your balls

reattached.

OZ

Keep it down, dude.

STIFLER

What the fuck are you doing here?

OZ

This place is an untapped resource.

Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz

girls are

hot

.

VOCAL JAZZ GIRL #1

Hey, we've got Conan the Barbarian

singing with us.

VOCAL JAZZ GIRL #2

Maybe he'll crush some beer cans on

his forehead.

HEATHER

I think he's got a nice voice.

VOCAL JAZZ GIRL #1

(ribbing her)

Go talk to him, maybe you can teach

him how to read.

STIFLER

You dipshit, you're expecting to score

with some goody-goody choir-girl

priss?

OZ

Dude, watch me work.  They go for

sensitive studs like me.

KEVIN

This is your plan, Finch?

FINCH

Yep.

KEVIN

This.  Right now.

FINCH

Uh-huh.

JIM

You're just gonna sit there and drink

your coffee?

FINCH

Mochaccino.

(then)

Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I

do need to ask for your cooperation in

one small matter.

KEVIN

Of course, Finch.  What?

FINCH

Whatever you hear about me, you agree.

KEVIN

What are we gonna hear?

FINCH

You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen

minute round trip.

JIM

Finch, don't you think it's about time

you learned to take a dump at school?

FINCH

When was the last time you looked at

the facilities here?

KEVIN

Fifteen minutes ago.

ENTHRALLED GIRL

Uh, guys?  Was that Paul Finch?

KEVIN

Yeah.

ENTHRALLED GIRL

You guys have like, seen him in the

locker room, right?

KEVIN

Yeah.

ENTHRALLED GIRL

Is it true that he's really...huge?

JIM

I have no idea.  Finch showers in a

bathing suit.

KEVIN

(forced)

No -- it's true.  He is...really...

big.

JIM

(loving it)

Yeah, enormous.

ENTHRALLED GIRL

Woah.  Does he have a date for prom

yet.

JIM

Definitely not.

ENTHRALLED GIRL

No way

!

KEVIN

(dumbfounded)

Finch hasn't done a damn thing, and

he's got girls lining up already.

KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)

Say that again, Kevin?

KEVIN

Uh...I thought you might know a trick

or something.  To make her, you

know...

KEVIN'S BROTHER

Orgasm?

KEVIN

Yeah.

SUSHI CUSTOMER

(to Kevin's Brother)

What's good here?

KEVIN'S BROTHER

Try the spicy tuna hand roll.

KEVIN

What?!  How do I do that?

KEVIN'S BROTHER

Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all

you're interested in?  Ways to get

your girlfriend into bed?

KEVIN

Well, no.  I think...I guess it would

be good to be able to return the

favor.  I mean, it would be nice to

know she enjoys things as much as I

do.

KEVIN'S BROTHER

That's good, that's what I needed to

hear.  Now you qualify.

KEVIN

Qualify for what?

KEVIN'S BROTHER

You've just inherited The Bible.

KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)

It originally started as a sex manual,

this book that some guys brought back

from Amsterdam in the early eighties.

What to do with your tongue, things

like that.  And each year, it got

passed on to one East student who was

worthy of it.

KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd)

After a couple years, guys started

adding their own techniques.  Things

they figured out themselves.

KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd)

You have to keep it a secret, and

return it at the end of the year.  So,

now you know.  Good luck.

JIM

(yells)

Mom?!  I'm home!

JIM'S DAD

Jim?

JIM

It's not what it looks like!

CUT TO:

JIM'S DAD

(fighting back tears)

I guess...we'll just tell your

mother...that we ate it all.

CHOIR TEACHER

What the hell was that?

OZ

Sorry.

CHOIR TEACHER

No, it was good.

OZ

Oh, well...

(noticing Heather looking at

him, he acts "sensitive")

It came from the heart.

CHOIR TEACHER

Well then keep it coming.

(to everyone)

Alright, people, good work!  Keep it

up and we'll do great at the state

competition.

HEATHER

Not bad, Chris.

OZ

(surprised himself)

Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather,

right?

HEATHER

Yeah...so...you've got this sort of...

Bobby McFerrin thing going there.

OZ

(no idea)

Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.

(then, back into it)

I feel like I've discovered this whole

new side of me.  Music is so

expressive.

HEATHER

(amused)

Okay.

(then)

I mean, I agree, but...aren't you

supposed to be out, like, trying to

decapitate someone with your lacrosse

stick or something?

OZ

Oh sure.  I know what people think.

It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass

lacrosse player -- I also play

football, by the way -- But that's

like...not

all

that I am.

HEATHER

Of course, I didn't --

OZ

(cutting her off)

I mean it really bothers me when

people try to pigeonhole me like that.

HEATHER

(sparking to this)

You?  You think I don't get that?

God, it's like just because I don't

get drunk and barf every weekend,

people say "Oh, here's this goody-two-

shoes choir-girl priss."

OZ

Yeah...so like, what else

do

you do?

HEATHER

(offended)

Well the same things you do.  Hang out

with friends and stuff, you know,

whatever.

(then)

What do you think I do?

OZ

(genuine)

I just -- realized that I didn't know

anything about you.  I was interested.

HEATHER

Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.

KEVIN

I was being selfish.  And majorly

insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.

VICKY

I think "shithead" really says it.

KEVIN

Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete

and total shithead!

KEVIN (CONT'D)

And I want to try to make it up to

you.

VICKY

How?

VICKY (V.O.)

Oh...ungghhhhh!

KEVIN (V.O.)

Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.

VICKY

Oh Kevin -- don't stop!

KEVIN

Just a second!

VICKY (cont'd)

(a little too loudly)

Oh, God!

VICKY (cont'd)

Moly shmmmt!  Fmmkkkk!

VICKY'S MOM

(yells to Vicky's Dad)

Hon?  Can you tell Vick to come on

down for supper?

KEVIN

Vicky, shhh, you know there's no lock

on your door.

VICKY (O.S.)

I'M COMING!

JIM

Hey, dad.  Did you knock?

JIM'S DAD

Oh, Jim!  I'm looking at the ol'

family portrait, here.  Yep.  It's a

good one.

JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)

Son, I wanted to talk to you about

what I think you were trying to do the

other day.

JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)

(continuing with his prepared

speech)

Now, you may have tried it in the

shower, or maybe in bed at night, and

not even known what you were doing.

Or perhaps you've heard your friends

talking about it in the locker room.

JIM

Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I

know what you're talking about.

JIM'S DAD

Sure you know, son, but I think you've

been having a little problem with it.

It's okay, though.  What you're doing

is perfectly normal.  It's like

practice.  Like when you play tennis

against a wall.  Some day, there'll be

a partner returning the ball.

(a beat)

You do want a partner, don't you son?

JIM

(through clenched teeth)

Yes.

JIM'S DAD

That's great.  Now remember, it's

okay

to play with yourself.  Or, as I

always called it --

(elbows Jim)

"Stroke the salami!"

(chuckles)

Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be

ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and

I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle

Mort masturbates.  We

all

masturbate.

JIM'S DAD (cont'd)

Poor guy thought he was the only one.

COACH MARSHALL

Good work, Ostreicher.

OZ

Thanks coach.

COACH MARSHALL

You're a killer, Ozzy!

OZ

(trying to get away)

-- Thanks, coach --

OZ

Hey, what're you doing here?

HEATHER

Just enjoying my exhilarating first

lacrosse experience.  You like,

"kicked butt."

OZ

(brushing it off her skirt)

Whoops, excuse me...

HEATHER

Um...Chris --

OZ

You can call me Oz.

HEATHER

Do I have to?

OZ

You can call me Ostreicher.

HEATHER

What's your middle name?

OZ

Forget it.

HEATHER

Come on!  I won't tell.

OZ

Neither will I.

HEATHER

Okay.

(pause)

So I had this...thought, and...this

may seem like it's out of left field,

and I don't know if you can, but since

I'm not going with anyone --

STIFLER

Hah!  Central sucks!

(noticing Heather)

Choir Chick?  What the hell are you

doing here?

HEATHER

Well, I uh, I was --

(decides to stand her ground)

I was asking Chris to prom.

(turns to Oz)

So do you wanna go?

OZ

Yeah

!

STIFLER

Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for

the limo.

OZ

Stifler, fuck --

(noticing Heather, "sensitive")

...man, you don't have to be so

insensitive.

STIFLER

What

??

(he dismisses it)

Whatever -- look uh, don't forget --

my cottage after prom.  On Lake

Michigan.

OZ

Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the

showers, but...I think this'll be

really good.

HEATHER

Yeah, me too, okay, cool.

STIFLER

My man Oz, working it with the choir

babes?

LACROSSE BUDDIES

(cheering, slapping him)

Yeah, go Oz! etc.

OZ

(pandering to them)

Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig

those cute little sweaters she wears.

STIFLER

I'll bet you do, you little horndog,

she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies,

right?

STIFLER (CONT'D)

Yeah!  Sing for me!  yes!

TEACHER

So once Hal becomes king, he has to

take on the responsibilities of

leadership, and turn his back on his

old, drunken friend, Falstaff.  You

see, Hal was going through a rite of

passage, much like you all are.  Make

the most of the time you've got left

together.  You'll miss it later.

OZ

So does your tongue cramp up?

KEVIN

Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.

JIM

Wow, that's amazing, she's probably

gonna want to do it soon.

SHERMAN

Still questing after the holy grail,

eh guys?

JIM

Hey, where's Finch?

KEVIN

Went home to shit.

JIM

I don't get it.  How does a guy like

that get this sudden reputation?

OZ

What reputation?

KEVIN

Observe.

KEVIN (cont'd)

Excuse me.  Do you know who Paul

Finch is?

RANDOM CUTE GIRL

Of course!  Have you guys seen his

tattoo?

KEVIN

...Yes?

RANDOM CUTE GIRL

Is it cool?  I heard it was like an

eagle, blazing in fire and stuff.

JIM

(nods, loving it)

Actually, it's an eagle and this big

python.

RANDOM CUTE GIRL

Really?!

JIM

Yeah, see it's on his stomach, here,

and the eagle -- the eagle is actually

grasping the python in its talons, so

the snake is like his --

KEVIN

(interrupting)

That's good, Jim.

RANDOM CUTE GIRL

Woah, no way!  That guy is so cool!

OZ

Okay, explain.

KEVIN

I can't, I have no idea how he's doing

it.  And that leaves you trailing,

Jim.  You gotta get your act together.

JIM

(a little aggravated)

Yeah, I know.  I'm working on it.

NADIA

You are very good in the world history

class, yes?

JIM

(gulps)

Me?

JIM (CONT'D)

(trying to decipher the guys'

signals)

Yes.  No.  Yes.

NADIA

Perhaps you can help me with my

studies?

JIM

Okay...that would be cool sometime.

(sees the guys gesticulating)

How 'bout tomorrow?

NADIA

Well, I do have ballet practice.

Perhaps I can come by your house

afterwards.  I can change clothes at

your place?

JIM

(barely, overwhelmed)

I suppose that would be okay.

OZ

Nice car.

HEATHER

I'm glad you think so.

OZ

You don't like it?

HEATHER

No, I like the car.

(then, direct)

By the way, though, about prom?  That

was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited

you.

OZ

What?!

HEATHER

Oh, please.  I asked you because I

thought you might actually be worth

going with.  But you are just a jock.

No wait.  You're a jerk.

OZ

What?  No I'm not.

HEATHER

I saw you making fun of me with your

lacrosse buddies.

OZ

I wasn't making fun of you.

HEATHER

Give me a break, you're so full of it.

CHOIR TEACHER

Okay, Heather, that was good, but I

want to thicken up that solo.

Michigan State is this Saturday, and I

want that part to

smoke

.

HEATHER

I know, my timing's off.

CHOIR TEACHER

A little, but I think it'll work

better as a duet.  With a tenor part.

OZ

(interrupting)

I'll do it.

OZ (CONT'D)

I'll do it.

CHOIR TEACHER

Okay then.  The rest of you okay with

that?

CHOIR TEACHER (CONT'D)

Great.  See you tomorrow.

HEATHER

(annoyed)

Why are you doing this?

OZ

Because I want to.

HEATHER

Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way

through this.  You better practice.

STIFLER

Fuck me!  You're gonna have a naked

Eastern-European chick in your house,

and you're telling me you're not gonna

take advantage of that?

JIM

What am I gonna do, broadcast her over

the internet?

OZ

You can do that?

JIM

(off their looks)

Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.

STIFLER

Dammit, Jim, get some fucking balls.

If you don't have the guts to

photograph a naked chick in your room,

how are you ever gonna sleep with one?

Now all you gotta do is set up some

sort of private link or whatever on

the net, and tell me the address.

KEVIN

You can send me the address too.

JIM

Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how

the hell am I gonna watch?

KEVIN

I'll save you a seat.

COMPUTER VOICE

"You have established an internet

connection."

KEVIN

There we go.

JIM'S DAD

Son.  This lady's here for you.

JIM

(like it's no big deal)

I know.  Hey Nadia.

NADIA

Hello James.  Ready to study.

JIM'S DAD

Oh, you bet he is.  Jim's quite the

bookworm.

JIM

Dad.

JIM'S DAD

Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm.

He's a good little kid.  Er, guy.

Man.

JIM

Dad!!

JIM'S DAD

Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those

books.

STIFLER'S BROTHER

Steve!  Steve!  It's

my

computer and

I

wanna use it!

STIFLER

Shut up and watch this, you might

learn something.

JIM

So you need to change, right?

NADIA

Do you mind?  This fabric is so

uncomfortable.

JIM

No, go right ahead and get dressed.

I'll just be downstairs, studying up.

Get me when you're ready.

KEVIN

Here we go.

JIM

Be back in a sec!

JIM'S MOM

Jim?  Honey, where are you going?

KEVIN

Want a beer?

JIM

Did I miss anything?!

KEVIN

Just in time.

JIM

Woah!

KEVIN

Oh, man!  This is incredible.

KEVIN (CONT'D)

I can't believe Oz had to work.

STIFLER'S BROTHER

This is like the coolest thing I've

ever seen.

JIM

Oh, thank you Lord, for this wonderful

day.

JIM (cont'd)

Hey!  You can't touch my stuff!

JIM (cont'd)

Oh no no no.

KEVIN

Nice collection there, Jim.

JIM

Dear God -- she's -- she's -- she's --

JIM (cont'd)

Gentlemen, I'd like to make an

announcement.  There is a gorgeous

woman masturbating on my bed.

KEVIN

You know, Jim...you could go back

there...and...

FINCH

(nodding)

Seduce her.

JIM

But, but -- what would I do?

KEVIN

Anything!  Just tell her it looks like

she needs an extra hand or something.

JIM

That's stupid.

KEVIN

No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right

now!  She's primed!

JIM

Oh...oh...oh, shit!

JIM

Hey mom hey dad!

JIM

Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.

KEVIN

Come on, Jim.  Where are you?

KEVIN (cont'd)

(into phone)

Hello?  Hey Sherman...what?!  How did

you know?

SHERMAN

(into phone)

Jim must've addressed that E-mail

wrong.  It went out to every mailbox

in the East High directory.  God, how

juvenile.

STONER #1

Whoa.

STONER #2

Kind.

JIM

Please, God.  Let this be it.

KEVIN

He's going in!

GUY #1

There's somebody going in there!

STONER #1

Hey, that guy's in my trig class.

JIM

Looks like you could use an extra

hand.

NADIA

(chastising)

James!  You have come in here on

purpose?!

JIM

Well...uh...

NADIA

Shame on you!

JIM

Uh...yeah...sorry.

NADIA

Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my

turn to see you.  Strip.

JIM

Strip?

NADIA

Yes, slowly.

JIM

You mean like,

strip

strip?

NADIA

(irresistably sexy)

For me?

FINCH

What do you suppose they're saying?

KEVIN

No idea.

NADIA

Perfect.

JIM

Uh...

NADIA

Move with the music.

JIM

Um...okay...

NADIA

No, no, you must put your whole body

into it.

JIM

Nadia, I can't --

NADIA

Can't what?  Do you not want to be

with me?  I wish to be entertained,

James.

STIFLER

What the fuck is this?

SHERMAN

The horror, the horror.

STONER #2

God, what a buzzkill.

GIRL IN BEDROOM

Work it, baby!

NADIA

(turned on)

More sexy, Jim, more sexy.

DISINTERESTED GIRL

He's no Paul Finch.

FINCH

This is truly revolting.

NADIA

(getting

really

turned on)

More, more, you bad boy!

GUY #1

Ugh...God...

NADIA

Now!  Hames, come to me.

JIM

Oh yeah!

NADIA

Be gentle.

KEVIN

Ho-lee shit.

STIFLER

This just got a hell of a lot better.

NADIA

Jim...

JIM

Oh no.

KEVIN

Oh no.

STONER #1

Bummer.

STIFLER'S BROTHER

What happened?!  What happened?!

STIFLER

He blew it.  Literally.

NADIA

You are done, James.  Perhaps I should

be going now.

JIM

No, no, I'm not done!  I've got

reserves!  Nadia, please please

please.  I'm begging you.

NADIA

I do like your dirty magazines.

JIM

Did you see this?  This is your more

exotic dirty magazine.

NADIA

Yes...James, it is knowing that these

beautiful women arouse you that

arouses me...

JIM

Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They

arouse me very much.  But not as

arousing as you.

NADIA

Oh Jim...

KEVIN/FINCH

Yes!!

STONER #1

Alright, dude!

GUY #1

He's re-engaging!

NADIA

So, "shaved" is the expression?

JIM

(mutters)

Holy shit.

KEVIN

Holy shit!

ALL THE GUYS

(unison)

HOLY SHIT!

NADIA

Touch me Jim...here.

GIRLS

Again?

KEVIN

Not again.

JIM

No, not again.

NADIA

(sighs)

I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will

not be doing any studying now.

JIM

No!  I've got...reserve reserves!

NADIA

It is too bad.  I was at first hoping

you would ask me to the prom.  But...

NADIA (cont'd)

You should change your shorts.

JIM

...okay.

COMPUTER VOICE

"You have lost your internet

connection.  Click 'okay' to

reconnect."

his

dance.  He stops.  ALMOST

KEVIN

Hey, minuteman.

JIM

Shut up.  You're supposed to be

supportive.

OZ

You've still got a chance with Nadia,

right?

JIM

No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing

on the net.  I don't think they liked

it.

KEVIN

How do you know that?

JIM

She's already on a plane back home.

JIM (cont'd)

You know, maybe I'm just not good with

girls, period.  Like I was born

without that part of the brain.  I

mean, I can't talk to girls.  And when

I do talk to them, I screw it up.

KEVIN

Yeah?  Well come prom night, those

excuses aren't going to do you much

good.

JIM

Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.

MICHELLE

And so, one time?  I was at band camp?

And we weren't supposed to have pillow

fights?  But we had a pillow fight!

And it was so much fun!

MICHELLE (cont'd)

And one time, we all lost our music?

And we were supposed to play this

song?  But we didn't know it.  So we

just made it up!  And we kept playing

and playing but the conductor didn't

know what we were doing and it was so

funny!

MICHELLE (cont'd)

So you're pissed about something, huh?

You know what I do when I'm angry?  I

just play some Bach on my flute.  It's

so relaxing.  I learned to do that at

band camp.

JIM

Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm

angry?

MICHELLE

Is it because we have a test tomorrow?

Sometimes I get cranky when I know I

have a big test to study for.

JIM

Yeah, that's pretty much it.

MICHELLE

I thought so.  Because, one time?  I

was at this --

JIM

(interrupting)

What was your name again?

MICHELLE

Michelle.

JIM

Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my

date for the prom?

MICHELLE

Really?  You seriously want to go with

me?

JIM

(so forced)

Yes.  Seriously.

MICHELLE

Are we going to Steve Stifler's party

afterwards?  That would be so cool.

JIM

Whatever you want.

MICHELLE

Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun!

It's like this one time, at band

camp...

OZ

Dammit!

KEVIN

You're not doing the extra credit

problems.

VICKY

No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence

of random numbers that look like I'm

doing the extra credit problems.  Mr.

Bender doesn't bother to check

homework past April.

KEVIN

That's my trick!

VICKY

It's everyone's trick, Kevin.

(she turns to him)

But I did pick it up from you.

KEVIN

We've come a long way since

Homecoming.

VICKY

(playful)

Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four-

point into a three-nine-five.

KEVIN

Indeed I did.  But, our relationship.

It's progressed a lot.  It's time for

us to...express ourselves in new ways.

VICKY

Like how?

KEVIN

Well, I feel that...things are getting

to that point in a relationship.

When two people share...a special

moment between them.

VICKY

I think you're so right, Kevin.

KEVIN

(pause)

You want to do it?

VICKY

Yes --

VICKY (CONT'D)

I love you.

VICKY (CONT'D)

Kevin?  Do you not love me?

KEVIN

No, I don't not love you.  I like, I

know that we've definitely got

something

between us.  Something good.

Something special.

VICKY

But you don't love me.

KEVIN

I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's

like a term that gets thrown around.

People say things, they get married,

have kids, and then what?  It's like

they call it off, going "I was wrong."

VICKY

Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two

of us, we're not your parents.

KEVIN

I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet,

okay?

VICKY

Okay.

HEATHER

Hi...

OZ

How did you know I was here?

HEATHER

Stifler told me.

OZ

You talked to Stifler?

HEATHER

Well...I needed to find you.  We are

gonna have to practice that song.

OZ

...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad

you came by.  I mean, really.

HEATHER

So you like, work nights?

OZ

Uh...my dad's the manager.

HEATHER

Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are

great.

OZ

Ah, he's always too heavy on the

vinegar.  If you really want a good

one, you gotta let me make it.

OZ

My dad's always here running the

store, busy and stuff...and I fill in

once a week so he can get a night off.

HEATHER

(pause)

That's nice.

OZ

(shrugs)

So you're going to Michigan?

HEATHER

Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go

to Northwestern.  I didn't want to

write all those extra essays they make

you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to

know what my "most emotionally

significant moment" was?  So when my U

of M acceptance came in December, I

said the hell with it.

OZ

Onions?

HEATHER

What?

OZ

You want onions?

HEATHER

Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major

in?

OZ

Well, State's got a good business

school.  And I can probably walk onto

the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?

HEATHER

Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured

out.

OZ

(dismissive)

Well, I mean, business is okay, and

lacrosse is awesome, but what am I

gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I

really have no idea.

HEATHER

Oh thank God, I thought I was the only

one.

OZ

Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?

HEATHER

Yeah.  You know, people are always

like, "What're you gonna major in?"

And I don't know.  And they're like,

"You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?

OZ

I know.  Salt and pepper?

HEATHER

Sure.

HEATHER (CONT'D)

So we're gonna be close next year?

OZ

You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East

Lansing and Ann Arbor.

HEATHER

(smiles)

...yeah.

OZ

Wanna swap your chips for cookies?

GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH

I'm sorry, I really can't go with

you...I'm holding out for someone

else.

STIFLER

You gotta be fucking kidding.

GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH

I know it's a long shot, but I figure

Paul Finch might ask me.

STIFLER

FINCH?  SHITBREAK?!!

GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH

Oh gosh, I forgot -- you uh, you look

okay...I mean you can't even tell...

KEVIN

Hey...what was that all about?

GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH

He's still embarrassed because Finch

kicked his ass.  Knocked out a tooth,

but you can't see it.

KEVIN

Right, and who told you that?

JESSICA

No comment.

KEVIN

No comment?!  Are you kidding me?!

I've never seen someone's image change

so...so drastically!

JESSICA

Thanks.  It was my idea.

KEVIN

Did you guys hook up or something?

JESSICA

Are you kidding?  No.

KEVIN

Then what the hell are you talking

about?

JESSICA

Well...I guess it's okay for me to

tell you now.  That reputation of his

isn't going anywhere.

(then)

Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica,

I need help with this, blah blah,

etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two-

hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple

girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So

he did, and I did.

KEVIN

I don't get it, that really works?

JESSICA

Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I

embellished a little bit.  Hey, did

you hear that Finch had sex with an

older woman?

JESSICA (CONT'D)

No?  Damn, that one was my favorite.

OZ

(singing happily)

...I needed the shelter of someone's

arms...there you were -- woo-hoo-

hoo...

OZ (CONT'D)

(still singing)

...I needed someone to understand my

ups and my downs, oh baby there you

were...

STIFLER

Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.

OZ

(cheery)

Come on, you know the words, sing

along.

STIFLER

No thanks, you've been singing that

shit all week.  If you try that at MSU

this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't

know you.

OZ

Our last game is this Saturday.

STIFLER

No shit.

OZ

...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's

really important, it's our last game.

And you know, Central almost beat us

last time, so I really want to kick

their ass, and it's like cool because

we're gonna get to play at State,

which means that after the game I

might be able to stop by...

HEATHER

(pause)

You can't sing at the competition.

OZ

I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I

just...I didn't realize it...

HEATHER

(upset but trying to be cool)

...it's okay, you should do whatever

makes you happy.

OZ

Alright...yeah...thanks for

understanding.

(a beat)

So I guess...I'll see you later.

STIFLER

Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?

KEVIN

(immediately sensing danger)

Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?

STIFLER

Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass

he kicked.

(off Kevin's look)

I'll tell you one thing, though.  I

don't think he's gonna have a problem

shitting in school anymore.

KEVIN

Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!

FINCH

Easy, tiger.  What's in there?

KEVIN

Just go!

FINCH

Why is this?

KEVIN

You're gonna shit your pants!

FINCH

Charming.

KEVIN

Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some

sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino

or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I

mean

really

fast.

FINCH

First of all, it's

Mocha

ccino, and

secondly...Oohhhh!

STIFLER

This way, sit.

FINCH

Come on come on come on...

FINCH (CONT'D)

Okay.  You can do this.

GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH

You know it's just gonna be some

crappy band and stupid decorations.

GIRL #2

You're just saying that cause prom's a

week away and you don't have a date.

GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH

No, I don't

want

a date...

(increasingly dreamy)

Finch is going stag...and so am

I...the guy is like so...debonair.

GIRL #2

Do you think that "older woman" thing

is true?

GIRL #3

Of course, it was Stifler's mom.

GIRL #2

Joanie, was that you?

FINCH

Aaaaaaarrrgghhhh!

DISSOLVE TO:

VOCAL JAZZ TEACHER

Okay.  Albert, you ready?

ALBERT

No problemo.

COACH MARSHALL

Alright!  Good hustle, guys, but we

can still lose.  You all saw what

happened to Oz out there.  I don't

ever want to see you guys

thinking

you're gonna score.  You don't score

until you score, period.

ALBERT

Focus on the music.  Think melody.

Let the music be my guide.

HEATHER

That would be a start.

COACH MARSHALL

It all boils down to today.  For you

seniors, this marks the culmination of

your past four years.  Think of what

that means to you.  Are you guys gonna

look back on your days at East and

know that you made the most of the

time you had?

COACH MARSHALL (cont'd)

Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher!

OZ

Good luck, guys.

COACH MARSHALL

Christ!  I didn't say you were out of

the game!

OZ

Sorry, coach.

COACH MARSHALL

What the fuck is this?  You got

someplace more important to be?

OZ

Yeah.

VOCAL JAZZ GUYS

Oz -- You're back -- Yeah --

ALBERT

-- Oh, great.

HEATHER

What about the game?!

OZ

I'm not playing.

HEATHER

You're missing the game for us?!

OZ

No.  I'm missing the game for you.

VOCAL JAZZ TEACHER

Okay, okay.  You guys got about a

minute to go.  Spend it warming up,

not making out.  This ain't the prom

yet.

JIM

Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!

KEVIN

(gives that "You rock!" hand

sign)

You fuckin' rule!

KEVIN

Hey...

VICKY

Did you know that it's...450 miles

from Ann Arbor to Nashville?

KEVIN

It's like a six or seven hour drive.

That's easy, I don't mind driving.

KEVIN (CONT'D)

About the other day...I've been

thinking.

VICKY

So have I.  And I know you want to

make things perfect for me.  And I

understand that you really wouldn't

tell me that until you were 100%

comfortable with it.

VICKY (CONT'D)

And I want to make things perfect for

you.  You're right, Kev, we do have

something good...and special.

KEVIN

Yeah, we have something great, Vick.

VICKY

Kevin...

(very close, whispered)

I want to have sex with you.

KEVIN

(almost frightened)

Now?!

VICKY

No...I know the perfect time...

MICHELLE

You know, at band camp?  We have

dances like this.  Only they're way

funner.  Don't you think prom is just

highly overrated?

JIM

Highly, highly overrated.

FINCH

Okay.  I'm here for your dumb...dumb

meeting.

SHERMAN

I'm on the offensive, boys.  The

Sherman Tank is going back in.

SHERMAN (CONT'D)

Locked on target, flying in stealth

mode under enemy sex radar.  Ready to

drop the payload...

again

.

KEVIN

Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well,

Finch, I know where you are, but you

can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?

JIM

My date's a flute-toting band dork.

That answer your question?

KEVIN

Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now

you guys are a couple or something?

OZ

(getting ticked)

Dammit, Kevin, what's with the

attitude?

KEVIN

Attitude?  Me?  I think that

you

guys

should be more enthusiastic.  Shit,

we've been trying to get laid forever,

and tonight's the night we've been

waiting for.  We're in this together.

Don't back out on me now!

JIM

Back out?  You don't need

us

to get

laid.  You afraid or something?

KEVIN

No, but come on guys, we made a pact!

OZ

Kevin, it was just a --

KEVIN

It was a pact

.  You break it and there

are no excuses.  You guys have to --

JIM

(interrupting, pissed)

I don't have to do shit!  Forget it

already!

JIM (cont'd)

I'm tired of all this bullshit

pressure!  I mean, I've never even had

sex and already I can't stand it!  I

hate sex!  I don't want it, I've never

wanted it, and I'm not gonna sit here

busting my balls over something that

just isn't that damn important!  So

fuck this stupid pact, fuck

you

, and

fuck sex!  Now, I'm gonna go hang out

with that geek over there, 'cause at

least she's got something else to talk

about besides sex!  God damn!

FINCH

At least I learned how to shit in

school.

JESSICA

Hey, Finch.  Wanna dance?

FINCH

How come you have no date?

JESSICA

I like to keep my options open.  And

let me just clarify that you have no

chance of scoring with me, Finch.

FINCH

No, of course not, don't be

ridiculous.

VICKY

So, I guess you and Sherman are pretty

close.  You met at that party a while

back?

CENTRAL GIRL

Yeah, we were up the whole night

together.  We had one of those

amazingly deep conversations, where

you really feel like you get to know

someone.

VICKY

(nudge, nudge)

"Deep conversation," huh?  Is that

what you guys call it?

CENTRAL GIRL

What else would I call it?

CENTRAL GIRL

Excuse me, everyone, sorry to

interrupt.

CENTRAL GIRL (cont'd)

I just wanted to let you all know

this:  Chuck Sherman is a liar.  I

never had sex with him.  He's never

had sex with anyone -- I know because

he told me.  Once, he tried to screw a

grapefruit, but that's it.  Oh, and he

also told me that sometimes when he

gets nervous he wets his pants.  Thank

you for your attention.

OZ

...Guess what?

KEVIN

I don't care.

JIM

Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's

is gonna be here soon.

KEVIN

I'm not going.

KEVIN (CONT'D)

This isn't how I wanted things to turn

out.  Making the pact wasn't just

about getting laid.  It was about

doing one last thing with you guys

before we graduated.  But now I've

just wasted my last few weeks here

trying to do what?  I don't even know.

All I managed to do was fuck up our

friendship.

OZ

I still think you're okay.

JIM

So do I, Kev.

FINCH

Me too.  For the most part.

KEVIN

Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I

don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm

acting like I've got it all together

tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna

ask me if I love her.  And I don't

know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's

like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the

whole thing.

JIM

Come on man.  Tonight

is

the night.

We're finally going to a post-prom

party on the lake.  We've been waiting

to do this for the last four years.

Why else are we still friends with

Stifler?  You gotta go.

OZ

And by the way, Sherman didn't even

get laid.

KEVIN

He didn't?

FINCH

Nope.  He pissed himself.

JIM

There it is.  I want to grab my bag.

Oh, and my date.

OZ

Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for

you.

JIM

Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.

MICHELLE

It reminds me of this one time --

(changing thoughts)

Hey, can I ask you a question?  How

come you don't have any stories?  I've

got lots of stories, and you don't

have any.

JIM

Oh, I've got stories, believe me.

They're a little more risque than

tales of Band Camp.

MICHELLE

Are they gross or something, like guy

stuff?  Tell me.

JIM

Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a

story.  Stifler finds this beer,

right?  And...

KEVIN

See -- this is the nicest room.

VICKY

Wow, Kev...it's perfect.

STIFLER'S BROTHER

You guys are gonna fuck, aren't you!?

KEVIN

No!  Get out of here!

STIFLER'S BROTHER

(running out of the room)

Fuckers fuckers fuckers fuckers!

OZ

There's something I've been meaning to

tell you, Heather.

HEATHER

What's that?

OZ

It's gonna sound really bad, but I

want you to know.

OZ (cont'd)

See, uh, I'm a virgin.  And me, Kevin,

Jim, and Finch, we all made this pact.

That we would...lose our virginity...

before high school was over.

OZ (cont'd)

And, see, tonight is supposed to be

the night we all do it.

HEATHER

This isn't the best way to proposition

me.

OZ

No, that's not what I mean.  I mean --

look.  You know what made me leave

that game?  Coach was giving this

speech, about not slacking off when

you see the opportunity to score.

HEATHER

This isn't any better, Chris.

OZ

No, see Heather, what I realized is

that...with you, it's not like I'm

running towards the goal, trying to

figure out the best way to score.  And

this may sound corny, but --

OZ (cont'd)

I feel like I've already won.

OZ (cont'd)

And, well, I really care about you.  A

lot.  And I want you to know that.

HEATHER

Oz, it's okay, I know.

OZ

You called me Oz.

HEATHER

Well, that's what your friends call

you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of

your friends now...and also...your

girlfriend.

OZ

Dieter.  My middle name is Dieter.

HEATHER

Hmm.  You know that's

(cracking up)

really a shitty middle name!

OZ

(laughing)

I know, it sucks!

FINCH

Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for

letting us have a great party.

STIFLER'S MOM

(dry)

As if there were any alternative

in the matter.  Are you enjoying

yourself?

FINCH

I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!

STIFLER'S MOM

(deadpan)

I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge

off, doesn't it?  And where might your

date be?

FINCH

Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.

STIFLER'S MOM

Pardon me?

FINCH

...Nevermind.  You have anything to

drink?

STIFLER'S MOM

I believe the kegs are upstairs.

FINCH

No, no, that's what the cretins drink.

I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.

STIFLER'S MOM

All right, I got some scotch.

FINCH

Single malt?

STIFLER'S MOM

Aged eighteen years.

(she gives him a look)

Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind

the bar.

MICHELLE

That is a

nasty

story!

JIM

I told you.

MICHELLE

You wanna hear a nasty story of mine?

It's kind of sexual.

JIM

Yeah, bring it on!

MICHELLE

Well, this one time?  At band camp?

We were playing this game, I don't

know if you know it?  But it's called

spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss

this guy named Marc Wander on the

lips?  And...

KEVIN

You comfortable?

VICKY

Yeah, are you?

KEVIN

Yeah.

VICKY

You sure you're comfortable?

KEVIN

Yeah.  Are you sure?

VICKY

Yeah.

KEVIN

Me too.

VICKY

Okay.

(a beat)

Did you bring a condom?

KEVIN

Yeah, right here.

KEVIN (CONT'D)

So, do you want to be -- I mean, how

do you want to do it?

VICKY

I don't know.  How do you?

KEVIN

Like, normal style.  The...missionary

position.

VICKY

Okay.

VICKY (cont'd)

Kevin...

KEVIN

Yeah Vick?

VICKY

I want to hear you say it.

KEVIN

Okay.

KEVIN (CONT'D)

Victoria...I love you.

VICKY

I love you.

OZ

I can't think of anything to say

that's not cheesy.

HEATHER

Then don't.

VICKY

Here.

JIM

So, the end of the story is...you had

to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?

MICHELLE

Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And

everyone laughed at me, but I didn't

care?  Because it was so funny!

JIM

(flat)

Okay, I get it.

MICHELLE

Oh!  And then this one time?  At band

camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.

JIM

...excuse me?!

MICHELLE

What, you think I don't know how to

get myself off?  Hell, that's what

half of band camp is!  Sex ed!

MICHELLE (cont'd)

So are we gonna screw soon?  I'm

getting kind of antsy.

JIM

This'll do.

MICHELLE

Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them

both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't

want you coming so damn early.

JIM

Why, uh, what makes you think that I --

MICHELLE

Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why

do you think I accepted this date?

You're a sure thing!

FINCH

So...would you object if I said you're

quite striking?

STIFLER'S MOM

Mister Finch -- are you trying to

seduce me?

FINCH

Yes ma'am, I am.

STIFLER'S MOM (O.S.)

I had no idea you'd be this good!

FINCH (O.S.)

Neither did I!

JIM (O.S.)

Are you gonna do what I think you're

gonna do?

MICHELLE (O.S.)

Don't you want me to?

JIM (O.S.)

Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!

MICHELLE (O.S.)

Okay!

JIM

Hail, hail, to Michigan, the leaders

and best!

STIFLER'S BROTHER

That was

awesome

!

do

see is the kitchen door handle rattling.  The

STIFLER

Ugh...oh no...

JIM

She's gone.

JIM (cont'd)

Oh my God.  She used me.

JIM (cont'd)

Wow!  I was used!  Cool!

JIM (CONT'D)

Hail! to the victors, valiant; Hail!

to the conquering heroes, hail...

KEVIN

That was a great night.

VICKY

Yeah.

KEVIN

I can't believe we just had our senior

prom.

VICKY

Yeah, the time went by so fast.

KEVIN

It did.

VICKY

Kevin, next year...with you in Ann

Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not

gonna work, is it.

KEVIN

Don't say that, we can do it somehow.

It might not be perfect, but --

VICKY

(interrupting)

No, Kevin --

(she sits up)

That's the whole thing, that's what

I've been realizing.  That nothing's

perfect, that you can't plan

everything.

KEVIN

It is far away...and we'll be on our

own...meeting new people...

KEVIN (CONT'D)

Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.

VICKY

I know.

(a beat)

Let's go.  Don't you have something to

tell your friends?

KEVIN

What?

VICKY

Your little pact.  Jessica told me all

about it.

(hits him lightly)

Way to go, Kev!

DISSOLVE TO:

KEVIN

(to Jim)

I guess we'll call you two-ply.

OZ

Yeah.  So you want double condiments

on that?

JIM

No, no that's fine.

(then, to Kevin)

So you doing okay?

KEVIN

(a wistful smile)

Yeah.

FINCH

I'll tell you, I've learned one thing:

women, like wine, get better with age.

(a beat)

Of course, I have no frame of

reference for this comparison.

KEVIN

So Oz, you almost made it, huh?

OZ

(smiles)

I'll just say that we had a great

night together.

JIM

Hang in there, buddy, you'll get

there.

OZ

I know.

KEVIN

Wow.  You two really have something

going, don't you?

OZ

I think we're falling in love.

KEVIN

You know what the coolest thing is?

This, right now.

OZ

It's true.  I mean, after this,

everything'll be different.

JIM

After getting laid?

OZ

After high school.

KEVIN

Yeah, but we'll still see each other.

OZ

Fuck yeah we will.

KEVIN

To the next step.

ALL

To the next step.

KEVIN

(into phone)

Hey.  I got another question for you.

KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)

What's that?

KEVIN (V.O.)

Um...I'm sort of wondering

about...love.

KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)

That's the next book, Kevin.  That's

the next book.

JIM'S DAD

(eyes tearing)

Son.  That's the best damn story I

ever heard.

JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)

You know, after I graduated high

school, my parents let me do some

traveling...

BELLBOY

(subtitled)

Another bottle?

WAITER

(subtitled)

He knows how to treat a woman.

JIM

Thanks guys.

NADIA

Come back to bed, James.

WAITER

(subtitled)

That is one lucky man.

BELLBOY

(subtitled)

Funny -- I swear I have seen those two

somewhere before.  The boy is some

sort of dancer.
