OBSERVE AND REPORT

Written by

Jody Hill

MARK

Ladies, please, we're doing

everything we can to handle the

situation. Nothing is more

important to us than the safety of

our shoppers. Now in the

meantime, feel free to check out

some of our wonderful back-to-

school sales. Excuse me for a

minute.

MARK

Have you seen Ronnie?

(CONTINUED)

2.

RECEPTIONIST

I haven't seen him all morning.

MARK

Ramon, have you seen Ronnie?

JANITOR

No, senor.

MARK

Where is Ronnie?

CUT TO:

3.

RONNIE

(cop authority voice)

Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!

STEVIE

Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a

parking lot.

RONNIE

Sir, pull over to the sidewalk,

NOW!

HECTOR

Leave us alone.

STEVIE

Yeah, skating's not a crime, dick.

RONNIE

Skateboarding is not allowed on

mall premises. Pull over now!

STEVIE

We're not leaving.

HECTOR

Yeah, fuck you!

(CONTINUED)

4.

STEVIE

What the fuck are you doing?

RONNIE

I was driving in reverse and

trying to get you to flip into the

back seat.

STEVIE

What?

RONNIE

That way I could handcuff you

smoothly and take you in. You

know, never mind, just get in the

goddamn golf cart.

5.

RONNIE

It seems like we go through this

every day. What's it going to

take for you all to realize that I

won't tolerate this horseplay and

just do whatever you want to and

don't worry about the rules

attitude?

STEVIE

Ronnie, I hear what you're saying

and I just want you to know that

personally, it pains me to see you

all worked up and I just want you

to know that I'm really sorry

because you can't do shit and you

can take your little rules and

stick'em up your ass, you fuckin'

rent-a-cop.

HECTOR

Yeah, suck my dick.

RONNIE

That's funny, guys. I try to be a

mentor to the youth, but it seems

like you boys have gone straight

past boydom to the land of street-

hardened criminals. I'm left with

no choice. You call me rent-a-

cop, but I call myself the law's

right hand. I see the crime...

and I phone it in. And that's

what I'm getting ready to do right

now.

RONNIE

(into walkie)

317, this is Ronnie Barnhardt over

at Carolina Mall. Come in, over.

(CONTINUED)

6.

WALKIE VOICE (V.O.)

This is Officer Douglas, what do

you wish to report? Over.

RONNIE

(into walkie)

I've got a couple of trespassers

who have been found skateboarding

on mall property. Can you send a

black and white over to take these

boys into processing? Over.

WALKIE VOICE (V.O.)

Uh... Yeah, Ronnie, we're kind of

busy today. I mean, we got like

three car accidents.

RONNIE

(into walkie)

What do you mean? I've got these

guys red-handed. I'm gonna need a

car over here pronto. I can't

hold them all day by myself.

Over.

WALKIE VOICE (V.O.)

Copy. Yeah, like I said, we're

awfully busy right now. I think

you should probably just make'em

promise not to do it again and

threaten to call their parents or

something. That'll get them.

Over.

RONNIE

(into walkie)

Sir, I don't think you understand,

their parents don't care about

them. This is a 911 from one of

your soldiers. Officer needs

assistance! Over!

WALKIE VOICE (V.O.)

Yeah, it's not gonna happen...

(CONTINUED)

7.

RONNIE

So as you can see, the law is just

one little call away. But I'm

gonna choose not to use that

tactic today. I'm gonna do

something that I like to do from

time to time, and that's called

handle shit myself.

RONNIE

While I won't have you arrested

today, I am going to suspend each

of you for one week. For those of

you who don't know how this works,

here it is. This is official

documentation. If you step foot

on mall property, it is considered

trespassing. At that point, I

call the police, they come down,

you go directly to jail.

RONNIE

You accepted it originally, so it

still counts.

NELL

Dear Lord, bless this food that we

eat and purify it with Your

salvation. Also, please keep

Ronnie safe as he works in Your

name to protect the customers and

employees and store owners of the

mall.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

8.

NELL (CONT'D)

And please turn your wrath on any

sinners that try to hurt him and

make them pay by burning in the

eternal flames of hell. In

Christ's name we pray, amen.

RONNIE

Amen.

NELL

So what's on the agenda for you

today?

RONNIE

You know, the usual. Spot crime

before it happens, perform random

acts of bravery, save people from

certain death, yada yada yada.

NELL

What's wrong, Ronnie?

RONNIE

Nothing, Nell.

NELL

Ronnie, I know that you really

want to be a Police Officer, but

you have to realize that things

work out the way they're meant to.

RONNIE

I know. I'm okay, Nell. Thanks,

but really, I mean, I'm on the

front lines right now. I'm livin'

it.

NELL

Your job is definitely more

exciting than mine.

RONNIE

Of course it is, but at least you

don't have to wrestle with the

demons at night. I better get

going.

NELL

I'll see you after work, sweetie.

(CONTINUED)

9.

RONNIE

Not at work, Nell. We have to

keep up appearances, we talked

about this. And don't call me

sweetie.

NELL

I'm sorry. I'll see you after

work, Officer Barnhardt.

RONNIE

'Bye, Nell.

RONNIE

Slow it down. Watch your speed

there. This ain't a race. Hey,

second time, slow it down.

MARK

I've been looking all over for you.

RONNIE

I haven't been hiding, but some

things that I have to do are

better to keep hidden from you and

'official' eyes. Trust me, it's

best all around if there are no

bodies to clean up.

MARK

So you may or may not have heard,

but this morning, several women

were assaulted just outside the

front doors by a crazy Pervert.

RONNIE

For the love of God.

MARK

I know, it's horrible.

(CONTINUED)

10.

RONNIE

You want me to phone this one in

to the police?

MARK

Not just yet. See if we call the

police, they'll be a big scandal

and something like that could kill

what little traffic we have at

this mall. What I need you to do

is watch out for this Pervert and

if you see him, try to stop him or

quietly phone it in so we can

handle this discreetly.

RONNIE

Hold on, Mark. Let me make sure I

understand you. You're telling me

to deny my primary objective of

Observing and Reporting crime and

at the same time, you're giving me

authorization to handle this case

on my own.

MARK

I'm just saying keep an eye out

and keep quiet.

RONNIE

So basically, I'm in charge of

this whole investigation.

MARK

There's no investigation.

RONNIE

Not yet. Okay, Mark, I'll do it,

but I'm gonna need a few things

first.

MARK

You can't carry a gun.

RONNIE

Well, I'm gonna need a new title.

Something to instill fear in the

criminal mind. How about Director

of Mall Intelligence?

MARK

Head of Mall Security.

RONNIE

That's perfect.

(CONTINUED)

11.

MARK

And it doesn't come with a raise.

RONNIE

Got it.

MARK

And the new title stays between

us.

RONNIE

Understood. Thank you for this

opportunity, Mark. I won't let

you down.

CUT TO:

FEMALE REPORTER

Excuse me, sir, but we would like

to ask you a few questions.

RONNIE

I'm sorry, but I can't answer

anything.

FEMALE REPORTER

We heard a report that an

unidentified man was spotted

earlier today exposing himself to

several women. Do you care to

comment?

RONNIE

I'm not allowed to comment on that

situation.

FEMALE REPORTER

So you admit there is a situation.

RONNIE

I'm trained to resist torture for

up to 72 hours, you really expect

me to break now? Get real, lady.

(CONTINUED)

12.

FEMALE REPORTER

(to her camera crew)

We're wasting our time here.

Let's go find some police to

interview.

RONNIE

Good luck.

FEMALE REPORTER

What's that supposed to mean?

RONNIE

It just means you won't find any

police.

FEMALE REPORTER

Are you telling me the police

haven't even been called!

RONNIE

(SARCASTIC)

Ewww, alert the media.

FEMALE REPORTER

Jesus, well who'd they leave in

charge, you?

FEMALE REPORTER

Yeah, right. Why would they leave

you in charge?

RONNIE

First of all, if there was a

situation to be handled, I don't

see why you find it so goddamn

ridiculous that I would be in

charge.

FEMALE REPORTER

(setting a trap)

Look, there is no way you're in

charge of this investigation.

RONNIE

Well for your information, I'm in

charge of this whole fucking

operation.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

13.

RONNIE (CONT'D)

I don't give a goddamn if you

believe me or not, Ms. Hot Fuckin'

SHIT news lady. I'm the first

line of defense against this

pervert. As the law's right hand,

I'm here so that people like you

can live in your own little happy

world and think places like this

mall are safe and fun. I'm the

defender of this war zone. Just

me and my goddamn flashlight.

SADDAMN

You motherfucker, you put a boot

on my car!

RONNIE

(cop voice)

I warned you about parking in the

fire lane, Saddamn!

SADDAMN

Fuck you, Ronnie! Take that

goddamn boot off of my car.

RONNIE

(going into cop

VOICE)

Step away now!

SADDAMN

I pay good money to this mall.

Don't tell me where to park!

RONNIE

Sir, I will be forced to take

action if you do not step back!

SADDAMN

I'm gonna kill you!

(CONTINUED)

14.

RONNIE

As I was saying, the pervert

situation here is real bleak. For

all you people out there thinking

of coming to the mall, please for

your own safety, stay away.

SADDAMN

(still fucked up)

I can't believe you tased me.

RONNIE

(to the man)

That's right and I've got another

one waiting right here for you.

CUT TO:

RONNIE

Hey, Brandi.

RONNIE

That color looks great on your

skin. Not just that color, but

I've noticed that all make-up

looks really good on you.

Especially the blue around your

eyes. I bet it drives the men

crazy.

RONNIE

It's okay.   I can say that because

I'm taken.

BRANDI

What do you want, Ronnie?

(CONTINUED)

15.

RONNIE

I'm here on official business.

See, I don't know if you know

this, but I have recently been

made Head of Mall Security. Did

you hear about that?

BRANDI

No.

RONNIE

Well, I'm sure you will. It's

actually pretty huge news. But

the reason I stopped by is to tell

you that it looks like we've got a

pervert on the loose. A real live

psychopath who gains sexual

gratification by exposing himself

to ladies such as yourself. I

just want to warn you to be

careful when coming and going to

work.

BRANDI

Okay, got it.

RONNIE

And you may not want to wear any

of those skirts that you like to

wear.

BRANDI

What skirts?

RONNIE

You know what skirts. Something

like that could set him off. And

for that matter, you better not

wear any of those little low-cut

top things either, okay?

Especially with those black bras

because, you can really see them

in the light. Perverts really

tend to notice stuff like that.

Okay, see you later.

(CONTINUED)

16.

RONNIE

Dennis, man, I'm glad we've got a

minute to talk. There's no easy

way to say this so I'm just going

to come right out with it. Mark

offered me the position of Head of

Mall Security. I know this isn't

easy for you to hear seeing as

you've been here longer than me.

But I want you to know that you're

my best friend and I'm only going

to accept the job if you're okay

with that.

RONNIE

Well, you should know I've already

accepted and it's too late to turn

it down now. Every ship needs a

captain. So you were passed over.

Who gives a shit? Dennis, in

time, you'll come to accept

answering to me. Remember, there

aren't any leaders in friendship.

We cool?

RONNIE

Hey, you want to go and grab a

beer or something?

RONNIE

Yeah, you're right. You're

probably in no mood to party after

that news. Well, try not to take

it too hard. See you later,

buddy.

17.

MOM

You think you're ready for a shot

at the title, motherfucker?!

RONNIE

I'm ready, Mom.

MOM

Ding ding.

RONNIE

Ow!

MOM

What's wrong, baby?    Is your pussy

hurting?

RONNIE

Fuck you!

MOM

Ah!

RONNIE

You give?

MOM

Fuck you!

MOM

Ow!

(CONTINUED)

18.

RONNIE

You move with me, you go down.

You move against me and your arm

breaks.

MOM

I give!

RONNIE

What's that?

MOM

I give!   Let me go, goddamn it.

MOM

I can't believe you got that lucky

shit on me.

RONNIE

Luck has nothing to do with it.

MOM

You almost broke my arm.

RONNIE

I'm sorry, Mom. Are you okay?

MOM

Not really.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

19.

RONNIE (V.O.)

Yeah, well for your information,

I'm in charge of this whole BEEP

operation. I don't give a BEEP if

you believe me or not, Ms. Hot

BEEP BEEP news lady. Do you see

anybody else? BEEP no you don't.

As the law's right hand, I'm the

first line of defense against this

pervert. I'm here so that people

like you can live in your own

little happy world and think

places like this mall are safe and

fun. I'm the defender of this war

zone. Just me and my BEEP

flashlight.

FEMALE REPORTER (V.O.)

No comment as to why steps are not

being taken, but this Security

Guard feels like he is the only

one doing anything to protect the

people who visit Carolina Mall

from the suspect. For all of us,

I hope this isn't the case. Back

to you, Lindsay.

MOM

(drunken slur)

I'm so proud of you, Ronnie.

RONNIE

Do you think I did good?

MOM

Hell yes.   You were great.

RONNIE

Ah, you're just drunk.

MOM

Nah, you did good.

RONNIE

Yeah, I usually don't come out to

the forefront like that.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

20.

RONNIE (CONT'D)

My official orders are Observe and

Report, but when Mark put me in

charge of mall security, something

inside of me changed. It's what

I've always wanted. Things

haven't always worked out, with

the whole... well, you know. But

this gives me faith that I can do

something great. This is my call

to duty and I'm going to answer.

I'm going to bust this fucking

pervert. I swear it on everything

I am. Anyway, I better get to

sleep. I got a big day tomorrow.

Good night, Mom.

(off no answer)

Mom?

RONNIE

You working the door here?

BOUNCER

That's what they tell me. They

needed to hire a little security

here in case the drunks get out of

line or whatever.

RONNIE

Kind of funny they thought they

needed more security here. Ha.

You do realize that if anyone gets

out of hand, you need to call me

to handle the situation.

BOUNCER

I work for O'Charley's, not for

the mall.

(CONTINUED)

21.

RONNIE

Granted, but you realize that my

jurisdiction supersedes any and

all other forms of security when

under the roof of Carolina Mall?

BOUNCER

You know, I thought about getting

a job as a Mall Security.

RONNIE

You did?

BOUNCER

Yeah, man. I mean, I'm kind of on

extended vacation from college and

it's just like, I don't want to do

shit, you know what I mean? My

parents said I have to work if I

want to live at home, but I just

don't feel like doing anything.

This was the easiest job I could

find, I mean, what the hell could

be hard about being a bouncer in a

mall restaurant? But now that I

think about it, Mall Security

could be easier than this.

RONNIE

My young friend, you are sorely

mistaken. Do you know how much

stuff I'm in charge of?

BOUNCER

No.

RONNIE

A shitload. That's not even

counting the parking lot.

BOUNCER

Really? I thought you just kind

of chilled out and called stuff

into the police.

RONNIE

No way, that's about like 75,

maybe 82 percent of it. There's

so much other stuff.

BOUNCER

Like what?

(CONTINUED)

22.

RONNIE

Two words, Friday Night.

BOUNCER

What about it?

RONNIE

It's crazy, let's just leave it at

that.

BOUNCER

Okay.

RONNIE

Listen. I like you, but I don't

like the fact that you're

masquerading as an official in the

security world. If you're serious

about a career in the security

world, then perhaps I could look

into getting you a job on my

staff?

BOUNCER

Oh yeah?

RONNIE

Part of my job is reaching out to

troubled youths such as yourself.

It's who I am.

BOUNCER

Does it pay more than $6.50 an

hour?

BOUNCER

(WHISPERING)

Seven even.

BOUNCER

I'd say that's more than I'm

making now.

RONNIE

Hold on, this job involves a

probationary period. You have to

prove yourself worthy. We can't

just hire any old Tom, Dick, or

Harry just because they want to

carry a flashlight.

(CONTINUED)

23.

BOUNCER

What do I have to do?

RONNIE

You have to complete a term as

deputy. You will answer directly

to me. Your job will be to come

and find me if you see any

trouble. If this works out, then

I will phone the crime into the

police. Now, this will train your

eyes to spot various criminal

activity. Once you have completed

your training, you will be awarded

an official position on my

security staff where you will have

the duty of actually phoning in

crimes to the police yourself.

BOUNCER

So basically, I just do what I'm

doing now and then you'll get me a

job?

RONNIE

For starters.

BOUNCER

How long does this mentorship

last?

RONNIE

Until Mark lets me hire another

guy.

BOUNCER

Can I smoke while I work?

RONNIE

Yes, you can.

BOUNCER

Sign me up.

RONNIE

You keep that attitude up and

you'll have no problem making the

squad.

BOUNCER

What's this?

(CONTINUED)

24.

RONNIE

It's a flashlight. Get to know

it. It's your new best friend.

Until you get your giant

flashlight. Then, that will be

your new best friend.

RONNIE

Okay, look alive, soldier. Deputy

time starts now. No more slacker

attitude for you.

RONNIE

You know, I remember when I got my

first flashlight...

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

25.

MARK

(to the crowd)

Alright, people, she's doing good.

We're just gonna get her down to

my office and everything's going

to be fine, so the best thing for

you employees to do is just get on

back to your stations and you

customers can go ahead and enjoy

the back to school savings here at

Carolina Mall.

BRANDI

It was horrible! Oh, my God, the

thought of that disgusting -- I

think I'm going to be sick.

BRUCE

Just let it out, baby.   He should

be ashamed!

BRANDI

I just keep playing it over and

over again in my head.

MARK

Brandi, please, Dennis has called

the police and let's just take

this down to my office.

DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER

What's going on?

BRUCE

A Pervert attacked Brandi is

what's going on!

DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER

Are you okay, Brandi?

BRANDI

Physically, yes. But

psychologically, no!

DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER

(WHISPERING)

Did you call the cops?

(CONTINUED)

26.

MARK

They're on the way.

DEPARTMENT STORE MANAGER

Yeah, we got to get her the fuck

out of here. Everybody's standing

around and nobody's shopping.

This is bad for business.

MARK

I'm trying, but she just keeps

crying.

RONNIE

Brandi! I came as soon as I

heard. Jesus, are you alright?

BRANDI

I'm fine, Ronnie.

MARK

She's fine, Ronnie.

RONNIE

This is one of the most heinous

things I've seen. Jesus, I tried

to tell you about the skirts.

It's not your fault, you little

fighter you. Ronnie's not mad,

okay?

MARK

Ronnie, can you get her down to my

office so the Police can talk to

her in private when they arrive.

RONNIE

Rogers.

BRANDI

I can't walk right now.   I feel

like I'm in shock.

RONNIE

Don't worry.   I'll carry you.

(CONTINUED)

27.

MARK

Oh, fucking Jesus.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Your secretary told me to come on

in. I'm Detective Harrison,

Cabarrus County Police.

MARK

Mark Talbert, I manage the mall.

This is Brandi, she's the one who

saw the deviant.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Hello, Brandi.     Are you doing

okay?

BRANDI

I'm really shaken up.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Yes, ma'am, I'm sure you are after

all you've been through, but I'm

here to tell you that we're going

to work together to make sure we

catch the person who did this.

(CONTINUED)

28.

RONNIE

My name is Ronnie Barnhardt, chief

inspector on the case and head of

Mall Security here at Carolina

Mall and this is my lieutenant,

Dennis. From one law enforcement

officer to another, I just want to

welcome you and say that we will

do whatever it takes to coordinate

with your department in order to

bring this assailant to justice.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Great.

(back to Brandi)

Okay, Brandi. Did you get a look

at the suspect?

BRANDI

Yes, I did.

RONNIE

Did you get a blood sample?

BRANDI

No.

RONNIE

That's a shame. Would have been

useful.

MARK

Go ahead, Detective.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Thank you. Brandi, can you

remember anything specifically?

What color was his hair? Was he

tall or short?

BRANDI

He was tall and skinny and he had

brown hair and it was real greasy.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Was his hair long or short?

(CONTINUED)

29.

BRANDI

It was long about to his

shoulders.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Did he say anything?

BRANDI

No, he just stood there and you

know, touched himself.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

What was he wearing?

BRANDI

Just a brown trench coat.

RONNIE

This is what I got so far.

RONNIE

What's yours look like?

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I just wrote a description.

RONNIE

Oh.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Okay, Brandi, I think that's good

for now. I think the best thing

at this point is to just follow up

with the other ladies who saw the

perpetrator yesterday and see if

they remember anything.

BRANDI

What if he comes back?

DETECTIVE HARRISON

That's highly unlikely. These

incidents are usually random and

unpredictable. I'm sure you'll be

safe.

(CONTINUED)

30.

RONNIE

I'm afraid I'm going to have to

disagree with you there,

Detective. By my math, it seems

pretty clear that Brandi's been

targeted.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Targeted? What gives you that

impression?

RONNIE

Well, how about the fact that she

was the first employee to get

assaulted? Not to mention the

fact that she is the prettiest

girl who works at this mall. To

me it seems obvious that this is

some sort of methodical villain

that plans on returning to finish

what he started by murdering

Brandi.

BRANDI

Is that going to happen?!

DETECTIVE HARRISON

That's not going to happen.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Well don't worry. I'm on the case

and I'm going to do everything in

my power to bring this guy down.

RONNIE

That's right, Brandi, you've got

the best team in law enforcement

working for you.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Look, I've got to get going.

Here's my card. I'll even write

my home phone number on the back,

just in the event you need to get

a hold of me.

(CONTINUED)

31.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Give me a call when you aren't

working and I'll have you come to

the station to look through some

mug shots.

(touches her leg)

Don't worry okay.

BRANDI

I feel a lot better now.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

What?

RONNIE

I'll take one of those cards as

well.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Oh, okay.

RONNIE

Go ahead and write your home phone

on there as well in case I need to

get a hold of you.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

You can just leave a message at

the station. I check my messages

constantly.

RONNIE

Sorry, but I'm gonna need those

digits. If we're gonna solve this

crime we need to constantly be in

communication with each other and

have an open door policy with

intelligence. Brandi, let me see

that card.

RONNIE

Cool, I'll call you later with an

update.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Don't do that.

(CONTINUED)

32.

RONNIE

It's no problem at all. We're

brothers of the badge. This is

what we do for each other.

RONNIE

Seems like a good guy. A little

green, but still solid.

NELL

What are you doing?

RONNIE

Just putting these posters up.

NELL

You've been so obsessed with

catching this pervert I've barely

seen you.

RONNIE

That's what it's like when you

date the Head of Mall Security.

The downside is we don't get to

see each other as much, but the

upside is you get to brag to all

your friends.

NELL

Well, are you ready to go?

RONNIE

Sure, let's take off.

(CONTINUED)

33.

NELL

What are you doing, Ronnie?

RONNIE

Come on, let me get some of those

big bazoombas.

NELL

Ronnie, no.

RONNIE

Goddamn it, are we ever gonna do

it?

NELL

You know we talked about this.

RONNIE

We did, it's just, well, I'm tired

of just doing what we do. I'm

ready for something bigger. Like

sex or just maybe using a finger

on you --

NELL

Ronnie, you know I'm saving myself

for marriage. I thought you were

okay with that.

RONNIE

Well, I used to be, it's just. I

don't know. What's so great about

being a 27-year-old virgin?

RONNIE

Nell, I'm sorry. Don't go away

like this.

(CONTINUED)

34.

NELL

I thought you loved my purity.

RONNIE

I do.   I really do. I'm sorry,

Nell.

NELL

It's okay.   I should leave anyway,

it's late.

RONNIE

I'll stop by for breakfast

tomorrow.

NELL

See ya tomorrow.

RONNIE

Mom, wake up.    Let's go to bed.

CUT TO:

RONNIE

Oh shit.

(CONTINUED)

35.

RONNIE

Good to see you, brother. Looks

like the old team is getting

together to crack one more case.

RONNIE

I'm ready to go to war with you.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Thanks for waking me up this

morning, Ronnie.

RONNIE

I've already checked the Security

tapes. They didn't catch a thing.

Someone must have broken in here

and turned them off.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

My team just checked all the doors

and there are no signs of forced

entry. I've also checked out the

crime scene, but we didn't see any

fingerprints on the glass. The

suspect was probably wearing

gloves.

MARK

That doesn't sound good.   How did

they do it?

RONNIE

Laser technology.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

My guess it was an inside job.

Probably someone who has access to

keys like a janitor or a security

guard.

RONNIE

Detective Harrison, can I ask you

how long you've been a detective

for?

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I'm almost at the end of my first

year.

(CONTINUED)

36.

RONNIE

Just as I thought, a rookie.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I've been a police officer for

several years.

RONNIE

Yeah, you're a rookie, okay. It's

fine, you'll learn with

experience. And when you do,

you'll discover that rule #1 of

law enforcement is that you don't

ever turn on a fellow officer.

Now, I know you would never

actually accuse somebody on my

Security Force of committing this

act of lawlessness.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Whoever did this would have to had

keys to the Security Room so they

could shut off the camera.

RONNIE

Look, my record speaks for itself

and as for Dennis, well I can

certainly vouch for him. Dennis

is one of the finest men I know,

so just take my word, you're

barking up the wrong tree. Now,

let's put this little squabble

behind us and get back to busting

the guys that robbed this mall.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, nobody is accusing

anybody, but I would like to stick

around for a while and interview

some of the employees.

MARK

Okay, but all I ask is that you do

it quietly, so that the hoopla is

kept to a minimum.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I understand.

RONNIE

I understand too, sir.

(CONTINUED)

37.

MARK

Ronnie, you are to leave Detective

Harrison alone and let him handle

the investigation.

RONNIE

No can do, Mark. When you

appointed me Head of Mall

Security, I swore an oath to

protect this mall and aid in

bringing crime to its knees.

MARK

You didn't swear an oath.

RONNIE

To myself I did.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, on these types of

investigations, it's usually not a

good idea to have too many cooks

in the kitchen.

RONNIE

There's only one cook. I'm a

chef. A cook and chef, together,

serving up justice.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I'm gonna do this alone.

RONNIE

Hot plates of justice.

RONNIE

Come on, rookie. Let me show you

the lay of the land.

CUT TO:

RONNIE

Okay, Dennis. I've gotta hang

with Detective Harrison.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

38.

RONNIE (CONT'D)

What I need for you to understand

is that just because Detective

Harrison is here, doesn't mean

that you and me are no longer best

friends. Sure, Harrison would be

cool to hang out with. He carries

a badge and a gun. He probably

owns a boat. Over time, we'll

probably become really close like

brothers, but for right now,

you're still number one. Now, I

must leave you behind because duty

calls, so... chin up. Radio if

you need anything.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

So, have you seen any suspicious

people hanging around the mall?

Anybody who might have been casing

the stores?

SADDAMN

Nah, man.   I ain't seen nothing.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Okay, well if you can think of

anything, here's my card.

RONNIE

(to Harrison)

My turn, Rookie.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

What are you doing, Ronnie?

RONNIE

Solving the whole case right

before your eyes.

(CONTINUED)

39.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, this is official police

business.

RONNIE

Hello, Saddamn.

SADDAMN

What the fuck you want, Ronnie?

RONNIE

I want your ass to face the music

is what I want.

SADDAMN

Don't come any further, bitch.

The restraining order says 20 feet

so just back the fuck up.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, I appreciate your

enthusiasm, but just let me handle

this.

(to Saddamn)

Have a good day, sir.

RONNIE

So you're just gonna let him slip

right through your fingers?

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I have no reason to make him a

suspect.

RONNIE

No reason? Look at him. There's

every reason in the goddamn book.

SADDAMN

Why are you saying that, man?

RONNIE

I think it's obvious, Saddamn.

SADDAMN

That's fucked up. You're racist,

man.

RONNIE

You're not even black.

(CONTINUED)

40.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, stop. We're finished

here. Now if you're going to tag

along, I'm gonna need you to just

stay back; are we clear?

RONNIE

Sure, sorry.   We're crystal.

SADDAMN

What's up, girl, you got a

boyfriend? Free cell phones with

a month trial and I throw in my

phone number for free.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Did you let anybody borrow your

keys?

JANITOR

No, senor.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Have you seen anything suspicious?

JANITOR

No, senor.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Okay, sir.   Thank you for your

time.

RONNIE

Alright, I believe I can be of

some assistance here.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, we talked about this.

RONNIE

This is a special circumstance.

(CONTINUED)

41.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

What special circumstance?

RONNIE

Communication skills, watch and

learn.

RONNIE

Que pasa?

JANITOR

Long drawn out conversation in

Spanish?

RONNIE

Como?

JANITOR

More Spanish dialogue.

RONNIE

Si.

(to Harrison)

Yeah, this guy definitely did it.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

What did he say?

RONNIE

I don't know, I don't speak

Spanish, but judging from his

tonal inflections, it's safe to

say that he's hiding something.

The only question is where.

(to Janitor)

Okay, Ramon, I'm giving you one

chance and one chance only to come

clean. Or else Detective Harrison

is going to come over to your

house and deport your whole family

back to Mexico.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

No, I'm not.

RONNIE

Good cop, bad cop, just play

along.

(to Ramon)

Where are you hiding the jewels?

(CONTINUED)

42.

JANITOR

No se.

RONNIE

Alright, you're gonna make me be

the bad guy here? Well, that's a

role I'm comfortable playing.

Let's just see what you're hiding.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, that's enough.

RONNIE

Think you're pretty slick, don't

you? Guess what? I'm pretty

slick too.

RONNIE

Alright, you're free -- Wait a

minute.

RONNIE

Okay, my mistake. Sir, you're

free to go. Uh, you might want to

have someone clean this up which

in this case is you, so, uh, chop-

chop. Wouldn't want anyone to

slip on this mess.

HOT CLERK

Hello, can I help you?

(CONTINUED)

43.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I'm Detective Harrison with the

Cabarrus County Police.

RONNIE

And I'm Ronnie Barnhardt, head of

Mall Security.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Okay, seriously, would you back

the fuck off?! I'm trying to do

my job and you're fucking it up.

RONNIE

Come on, we're working here.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I'm working!

DETECTIVE HARRISON

(back to the Clerk)

Sorry. Hi. I'm doing a check

with all the mall employees to see

if anybody has any information on

the robbery that took place here

last night?

HOT CLERK

I'm sorry, but I haven't noticed

anything out of ordinary.

SEXY WORKER

Tracy, do you think my boyfriend

would like these?

DETECTIVE HARRISON

That's fine, thanks for the help.

RONNIE

You're gonna let them distract you

with a little bit of panty

showing.    You have got a lot to

learn, my friend.

(to the Hot Clerk)

Who are you protecting, toots?

(CONTINUED)

44.

HOT CLERK

What are you talking about?

RONNIE

Look, I'm sure you and your little

friend have made a real lifestyle

for yourselves here. It's

probably easy for you to blind

most men with your beauty, but I'm

not most men. I can see through

the sexuality to the truth.

Jewelry, gold, diamonds, you don't

really expect me to think that a

man wants that crap. I'm putting

you on my list of top suspects. I

don't think you did the crime, but

I do think you are an accomplice.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I'm sorry, ma'am. He's not with

me. Here's my card. If you think

of anything, just give me a call.

RONNIE

You should be ashamed of yourself.

RONNIE

Is that pot I smell?

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Shut up, Ronnie!

SALESMAN

It's sage.

RONNIE

Whatever, hippy. If I find you

doing drugs or killing cats or

whatever you devil worshippers do,

I'll come back here and bust you.

I swear to God.

(CONTINUED)

45.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Get the hell out, Ronnie. I'm

here to ask questions about the

robbery.

RONNIE

Just forget that, we're on to

something bigger here.

(back to the

SALESMAN)

Tell me more about this 'sage.'

CUT TO:

RONNIE

Now, maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm

the smartest man alive, but it

seems kind of convenient to me

that you sell hammers like this

one that could easily be used to

smash a glass case in, oh say, a

jewelry store.

SEARS MANAGER

Couldn't you smash the glass with

anything?

RONNIE

You really think you're gonna talk

your way out of this one?

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

46.

RONNIE

You guys should have been there

today. We were just solving shit

left and right. I mean, that's

what this job is supposed to be

like. Busting loiterers and kids

who steal pennies from the

fountain has its rewards, but

really getting in there and

closing cases is where it's at.

It's rewarding too because at the

end of the day, you know you've

done something good for the world.

BOUNCER

What are we doing here, Ronnie? I

thought you said they were giving

away free Chick-fil-A sandwiches.

RONNIE

Well -- What is your name anyway?

BOUNCER

Charles.

RONNIE

Well, my young apprentice. I

called you here today because as

Head of Mall Security, I have

decided that it's time to take

protection to the next level. In

other words, I alone cannot combat

this recent crime wave. In order

to help me in my personal journey,

I have decided to divide up the

tasks between my soldiers. So,

for now on, Dennis, my right-hand

man, you will be in charge of

solving the case of who is robbing

the mall. Little Chucky, you will

be on the case of the Pervert.

You are both to collect data and

provide it to me. I will analyze

the data, draw conclusions, and

solve these crimes as well as

coordinate and strategize with

various law enforcement agencies.

BOUNCER

Since we're going to be doing a

lot of the work and you're going

to be solving the crimes, do we at

least get paid?

(CONTINUED)

47.

RONNIE

You can't measure honor in dollars

and cents.

BOUNCER

Is that your girlfriend or

something, Ronnie?

RONNIE

Who me? Nah, man. Why?     What do

you think of her?

BOUNCER

She's not my type, but that's just

me.

RONNIE

Yeah, but, you don't think she's

kind of hot?

BOUNCER

Are you blind? Give me a break.

Wait, are you sure she's not your

girlfriend?

RONNIE

Fuck no. There's no way I'd date

that... person who's obviously not

hot.

RONNIE

Anyway, our new unit will operate

under the name, 'Special Elite

Task Force.' You will answer

directly to me and no one else.

Now, let's all put our hands in

the middle and do a unifying

cheer.

BOUNCER

You're gonna hook me up with a

job, right?

RONNIE

Seven even.   I promise.

(CONTINUED)

48.

RONNIE

One, two, three, TASK FORCE!

RONNIE

Okay, so now I say we all take a

celebratory trip to Sears because,

as we all know, today is half-

price day on all automotive parts

for mall employees.

CUT TO:

CUT TO BLACK.

BRANDI

Sorry to interrupt.

(CONTINUED)

49.

RONNIE

It's no interruption.   What are

you still doing here?

BRANDI

I had to do inventory tonight.

Bruce took off early so I'm the

last one. Hey, I was wondering if

you would mind walking me to my

car. You know, just in case that

freak with the dick is out there

someplace.

RONNIE

It would be my honor.

BRANDI

Alright, thanks for the ride.

RONNIE

Just doing my job with a little

something extra especially for

you.

BRANDI

See ya tomorrow.

RONNIE

Brandi, um... I was just thinking,

would you like to go to dinner

this weekend?

BRANDI

How come every time somebody does

something nice for me, they act

like I owe them a blow job?

RONNIE

Look, it's not like that. I've

got a girlfriend... who doesn't

work in this mall.

BRANDI

Ronnie, I got to be honest with

you, you're not really my type.

(CONTINUED)

50.

RONNIE

Just out of curiosity, what is

your type?

BRANDI

Rich guys.    Or guys who are really

hot.

RONNIE

Yeah, I guess that's not me.

BRANDI

I'll go out to dinner with you on

one condition.

RONNIE

What's that?

BRANDI

This is not a date. Do you

understand? We're going to

dinner, but we are not going on a

date.

RONNIE

Done.

BRANDI

And you can never tell anybody we

went out.

RONNIE

My lips are sealed.

BRANDI

You pay for dinner, right?   And as

many drinks as I want.

RONNIE

You may drink your fill.

BRANDI

And you have to drive me to my car

every night after work for the

next six months.

RONNIE

You got it.

BRANDI

And my car is low on gas, so I

need some money to fill it up.

(CONTINUED)

51.

RONNIE

Is $20 enough?

BRANDI

Nah, fifty.

BRANDI

Okay, you can pick me up after

work on Saturday. Dinner and

that's it. Don't try to kiss me

because I'll smack the shit out of

you. It's not a date.

RONNIE

Got it.   Not a date.

BRANDI

Thanks for the ride.

RONNIE

Hey, Brandi.

BRANDI

What?

RONNIE

I lied.   It is a date.

STEVIE

Our suspension is over.

RONNIE

I'm not here for that.    I need to

talk to you.

(CONTINUED)

52.

BODYGUARD

Anything you want to say to

Stevie, you can say to me,

motherfucker!

RONNIE

Who the fuck are you?

STEVIE

This is my cousin, Roy.      He's a

boxer.

BODYGUARD

You got a fuckin' problem, bitch?!

BODYGUARD

My eyes!

STEVIE

Jesus, Ronnie, what the fuck are

you doing?

RONNIE

I need a favor.

STEVIE

I'm listening.

RONNIE

As you know, we've had a lot of

crime around here lately. Between

the Flasher and all the break-ins,

I've decided to go to the streets.

Frankly, I'm looking for a stool

pigeon and you're just the right

person.

STEVIE

Why would I want to help you?

RONNIE

I could make it worth your while.

You like skating at the mall. I

could allow you to skate here

whenever you wanted. In exchange,

you keep your eyes peeled and

provide me with any information

you come across as to the identity

of the perpetrators.

(CONTINUED)

53.

STEVIE

Sorry, dude, but I'm no snitch.

Go find somebody else to do your

dirty work.

RONNIE

Well, let me put it another way.

If you don't help me, I'm gonna

spread your little butt cheeks and

stick this flashlight up your ass.

But like for real. Like I really

will do that. This is the new me

talking and I get what I need, you

understand me, Stevie?

STEVIE

Alright, dude, I understand, you

sick fuck.

RONNIE

Cool. In that case, have fun

shreadin'.

STEVIE

Stop crying, Roy.

NELL

Hey, sweetie -- Oh, I'm sorry,

good morning, Officer Barnhardt.

RONNIE

Good morning, Nell.

NELL

Where were you last night? I

tried to call, but your mom said

you weren't home from work yet.

(CONTINUED)

54.

RONNIE

Look, I got to talk to you about

something. I'm not really sure

how to put this. Let's see. If

you drove a Toyota.

NELL

I drive a Ford.

RONNIE

I know, but let's just pretend you

drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota

runs really good. It always

starts when you need it to and it

gets good gas mileage and you

don't have to do much to maintain

it. Then you get a really

important job like Astronaut, no

that won't work, you get a job as

the head of Wall Street. Well,

you may really like that Toyota,

but you're going to feel weird

about driving it to work every

day, right? Now let's say that

somebody offers you a chance to

get rid of that Toyota and instead

you get a Ferrari. It may be more

expensive and harder to drive, but

I mean, it just looks good as

hell. What would you do?

NELL

I don't get it.

RONNIE

You would trade up, Nell. Well,

that's exactly what I'm doing.

NELL

Are you thinking about getting a

new car?

RONNIE

No, Nell, I'm getting a new

girlfriend.

NELL

What?!   Who?

RONNIE

This girl, Brandi.

(CONTINUED)

55.

NELL

The slutty girl who works at the

make-up counter?

RONNIE

Yeah, I mean, no, she's not a

slut. But you're thinking of the

right person.

NELL

How could you do this to me?

RONNIE

I'm sorry. I don't mean to hurt

you. It's just, well, I believe

in this world, you play the hand

you're dealt and at this point in

my life, I've been dealt five

Aces. I'd be a fool not to bet.

NELL

Why are you doing this, Ronnie?

RONNIE

I have to, Nell.

NELL

Don't you love me?

RONNIE

Of course I love you.

NELL

Then tell me why?

RONNIE

Because I've never dated the prom

queen before.

NELL

Remember when you started this

job? You weren't such a hotshot

then. I've stood by you when you

were at your worst. Every time

you fell, I held your hand and

told you everything would be okay.

Time and time again.

RONNIE

Come on.   Why do you have to bring

that up?

(CONTINUED)

56.

NELL

I never cared about who you wanted

to be, I fell in love with who you

really are. If you leave me,

Ronnie, I won't be there to pick

you up when you fall.

RONNIE

Even if I do fall, it won't

matter, because I'm learning to

fly.

SLICK SALESMAN

Can I help you, sir?

RONNIE

Yeah, um, I've got a really

special date tonight with a hot

young lady -- Do you know Brandi?

SLICK SALESMAN

No.

RONNIE

Never mind. Anyway, I need

something that's really 'cool.'

Something that will impress her

and I guess you could say I'm not

exactly in the know with what the

hipsters are up to these days.

SLICK SALESMAN

Let's see. Are you looking to

fall in love or are you looking to

get laid?

RONNIE

Um, I guess love, but uh...

SLICK SALESMAN

You want to get laid, too?

(CONTINUED)

57.

RONNIE

Watch it, man.     She's a lady.   But

yes.

SLICK SALESMAN

Alright, I got just the thing.

Something classy is what you want.

Show her you're a man with taste.

CUT TO:

MOM

Come on, Ronnie, just get out

here.

RONNIE

It's too tight in the butt.

MOM

Let me see.

MOM

Ronnie, you look so handsome!

RONNIE

Really, you don't think I look

like a phony.

MOM

Hell no.   You look like a stud

muffin.

RONNIE

Yeah, I guess these clothes are

kind of cool.

MOM

Nell is a lucky girl.

RONNIE

Its not Nell, Mom.

(CONTINUED)

58.

MOM

Really, I thought you and Nell

were going to get married some

day.

RONNIE

I did too. But then I met this

girl Brandi and she swept me off

my feet.

MOM

Well, I always liked Nell, but as

long as you're happy, Ronnie,

that's all I care about.

RONNIE

I actually feel kind of bad about

Nell, but I figure that I can pour

all the sadness into Brandi and

just really rely on her for my

happiness instead of Nell.

MOM

That sounds wonderful.   Is she

pretty?

RONNIE

She is, Mom. She's the most

perfect girl in the whole world.

MOM

I remember when your father picked

me up for our first date. I swear

he was the most handsome man that

I had ever laid eyes on. I knew

right then and there that this

would be the man that I married.

RONNIE

I hope that happens tonight.

MOM

It will, Ronnie. Then you'll have

to give her a ring like the one

your father gave me.

RONNIE

Is that a yellow diamond?

(CONTINUED)

59.

MOM

It's a glass diamond.   This is how

it looks now.

RONNIE

Mom, why did Dad leave?

MOM

Well, he kind of freaked out when

you were born. You had so many

special needs that he just

couldn't handle the pressure. One

day, he just couldn't take it

anymore.

RONNIE

Do you think it was my fault that

Dad left?

MOM

Definitely. You don't think it

was mine do you?

RONNIE

Well, I didn't know, with the

drinking and all.

MOM

Nope, it was all you.

MOM

I love you, Ronnie.

RONNIE

I love you, too, Mom.

RONNIE

Damn, that was pretty impressive.

BRANDI

Yeah, work's been pissing me off,

so I just need to blow off some

steam.

(CONTINUED)

60.

RONNIE

Well, Brandi, can I just say that

you look absolutely beautiful

tonight.

BRANDI

Yeah, I know.

(calling to waiter)

Nurse! Get me another --

(to Ronnie)

You got this, right?

RONNIE

Yeah, yeah.   No problem.

BRANDI

Nurse! Bring me another and keep

'em coming.

(to Ronnie)

I think it's funny to call the

waitress nurse.

BRANDI

Hey, what's that?

RONNIE

Oh, it's nothing.

BRANDI

Don't be stingy, what the fuck is

that?

RONNIE

It's just a pill I'm supposed to

take.

BRANDI

Let me see.

BRANDI

Where the fuck did you find these?

RONNIE

The Doctor.

(CONTINUED)

61.

BRANDI

Damn, Ronnie, Klonopin. I'm

impressed. This is the good shit.

I didn't know you partied like

this.

RONNIE

Yeah, I guess I party like this

every four to six hours as needed.

BRANDI

Let me get one.

RONNIE

Help yourself.

BRANDI

Hell yeah!

RONNIE

So, how do you like working at the

mall?

BRANDI

I hate that shit. All I do is

listen to bitching all day long.

I got to put makeup on these fat-

ass women all day and it's like, I

don't give a shit what you do, you

can't polish a turd.

RONNIE

Yeah, I see how that could get to

you.

BRANDI

Let's do some shots.      Waiter, four

shots of Jager!

RONNIE

That's a lot.

BRANDI

It's Friday.

RONNIE

So, Brandi, I hope I'm not being

too forward, but do you have a

boyfriend?

(CONTINUED)

62.

BRANDI

I've got a few hook-ups but nobody

who is a boyfriend.

RONNIE

Yes!

BRANDI

You know, it's just like a time in

my life where I want to be free

right now and think about myself.

Not get tied down to one person.

RONNIE

Yeah, I understand. I hate ties.

I recently cut mine and now I'm

free like a bird.

BRANDI

Alright, bottoms up.

RONNIE

To new beginnings.

BRANDI

Right up your ass!

RONNIE

Okay.

BRANDI

Oh, shit!

RONNIE

No more.    I'm sticking to beer.

BRANDI

What's wrong, is your pussy

hurting?

RONNIE

God, you remind me so much of my

mother.

(CONTINUED)

63.

BRANDI

Feel the burn, bitch!

RONNIE

You are so beautiful.

BRANDI

Who wants to see my titties?!

RONNIE

Brandi, this is the most fun I've

ever had on a date.

BRANDI

For the last time, this ain't a

date, motherfucker! This is a

party!

RONNIE

Wooo! Um, so, Brandi, it's no

secret that I'm attracted to you.

I think everybody in the mall is.

As you know, I recently split with

my girlfriend and basically, I was

wondering if, since you don't have

a boyfriend, that I could maybe be

your boyfriend and you could be my

girlfriend?

BRANDI

That's my house!

(CONTINUED)

64.

RONNIE

Brandi, I had a wonderful time

tonight.

BRANDI

I'm so fucking shit-faced.

RONNIE

Are you okay?

BRANDI

My breath smells like asshole.

RONNIE

I love you, Brandi.

BRANDI

I think I've got puke in my teeth.

RONNIE

I don't care.

CUT TO BLACK.

RONNIE

Don't look at me like that,

Dennis. I told you I wouldn't

talk.

(CONTINUED)

65.

RONNIE

I'm serious, Dennis. A gentleman

never kisses and tells. So, just

stop with all the pressure because

it's just not gonna happen.

RONNIE

Okay, fine, you son of a bitch,

you want details, I'll give you

details. I had sex with Brandi

last night.

RONNIE

It was amazing. I mean, I've

never experienced anything like

it. I've been with a girl or two.

RONNIE

Okay, fine, I've been with a girl,

but let me tell you, this was so

much better. You know how many

times we did it? Twice! BAM!

BAM! BAM!

RONNIE

But I got to tell you, Dennis. It

was steamy and sexy, but more than

anything, I should tell you that

it's her soul that I fell for the

most. She got pretty tanked, but

I could just really tell that

she's a good person. The kind of

person that I could see myself

with.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

66.

RONNIE (CONT'D)

Look, I'm gonna get out of here.

There's a lot of people I need to

tell about this, so I'll catch up

with you later. Oh, and I almost

forgot, keep your eyes peeled for

crime and stuff.

NELL

Excuse me.

BRANDI

How may I help you?

NELL

I need to talk to you.

BRANDI

What is it, honey? Let me guess.

You're looking for something to

take care of those blackheads and

hide that puffiness under your

eyes. I've got just the thing.

NELL

No, that's not it.    Well, how much

is it?

BRANDI

Fifty dollars for the bottle.

NELL

Okay, I'll take it.

NELL

Listen, I know you're Ronnie's new

girlfriend.

BRANDI

What the hell are you talking

about?

(CONTINUED)

67.

NELL

It's okay. I know he left me to

be with you and I accept that.

BRANDI

I don't know who you've been

talking to, but it's safe to say

that you're fucking trippin'.

NELL

It's fine really. It's going to

take a while for me to get over

it, but I'll be okay.

BRANDI

Oh fuckin' Lord. This is

disgusting.

NELL

I'm sorry.

BRANDI

Pull it together. This is how you

run around all the time? Have

some self-respect. No wonder your

man left you. Who the hell would

want to be around this shit all

day?

NELL

Jesus teaches us to forgive. And

I forgive you for what you did to

me when you stole my boyfriend.

Plus, I feel pretty confident that

you'll end up burning in hell

because of the various evil ways

you live your life and that brings

me some satisfaction. But I just

want to tell you that Ronnie is a

good person. He does a lot of

stupid stuff, but really, he wants

to do good for the world. I want

you to know that if you hurt him

and ruin his heart, I will

personally come down here and kick

the ever living shit out of you.

(CONTINUED)

68.

BRANDI

You better fuckin' run, bitch!

BRANDI

I'm just kidding.

NELL

It's not too late to change your

ways.

BRUCE

Okay.   Thanks.

FLOWER SALESMAN

Ronnie, I've been expecting you.

RONNIE

You have?

FLOWER SALESMAN

Oh yeah, I heard about last night.

Brandi is quite the woman.

Congratulations, my friend. Or

should I say, welcome to the club?

RONNIE

What color of roses do the women

like anyway?

FLOWER SALESMAN

Well, it depends on what you are

trying to say. The white roses

symbolize innocence and purity.

(CONTINUED)

69.

RONNIE

Yeah, we're way past the color

white if you know what I mean.

What about the yellow ones?

FLOWER SALESMAN

Joy, happiness, appreciation.

RONNIE

I don't even know what to make of

that.

FLOWER SALESMAN

The pink rose means thank you.

RONNIE

Next.

FLOWER SALESMAN

The red rose is the most powerful.

It symbolizes love.

RONNIE

Why didn't you just say that?    I'm

a busy man here.

FLOWER SALESMAN

I'm sorry.

RONNIE

Forget it. Give me a big bag of

the red ones.

FLOWER SALESMAN

Um, can I ask a question?

RONNIE

Go ahead.

FLOWER SALESMAN

Do you really like Brandi?

RONNIE

I've only been on one date with

her, but I could see myself being

with her for all of eternity.

FLOWER SALESMAN

Well, in that case, the greatest

symbol of love is just a single

red rose.

(CONTINUED)

70.

RONNIE

Seems   like a big bag of roses

would   be more love than just one,

but I   guess you're the expert.

Gimme   one.

RONNIE

Brandi?

BRANDI

What are you doing here?

RONNIE

I came here to see you. And to

present you with this single red

rose. It symbolizes 'love.'

BRANDI

Ronnie, that's really... uncalled

for.

RONNIE

Well, after last night,   I just

wanted you to know that   it wasn't

just some fling to me.    It meant

something special and I   felt it

deep in my soul.

BRUCE

You fucked the Security Guard?

(PLAYFUL)

You are such a little slut!

BRANDI

Oh, like you've never been drunk,

Bruce!

BRANDI

Ronnie, look. I got to be honest

with you. I barely remember last

night.

(CONTINUED)

71.

RONNIE

I remember it for the both of us.

BRANDI

Okay, see here's the thing. I

don't know how to say this, so I'm

just gonna come on out with it.

Ronnie, I could never date you

seriously. I mean, you're a

security guard.

RONNIE

I'm the head of Mall Security.

BRANDI

Exactly. The point is, I don't

really see myself being with that.

Like ever. You know what I mean?

RONNIE

Brandi, I know exactly what you

mean. And I just want to thank

you for being honest. You're

telling me I'm not living up to my

full potential in life. It's

funny, because I've been feeling

like this for quite some time. I

guess I just needed that extra

little push to get me over this

hurdle I've been stuck on. How

can you be with a man who isn't

living the life he was meant to?

BRANDI

Yeah, something like that. And

just you know, you're a security

guard at the mall and it's like,

come on, you know?

RONNIE

I don't like it, Brandi, but I do

understand. I promise you this.

Next time you see me, I will be

wearing a uniform that will make

you proud. I will be the man that

you will be honored to call your

life's love.

BRANDI

Don't bet on it.

(CONTINUED)

72.

RONNIE

I will though. I'll bet

everything I have on you. Now I

ask you for one favor. Although I

am unworthy, will you accept this

rose from me anyway?

BRANDI

I can't do that. And tell your

girlfriend to stop coming by my

work and threatening me and shit.

CUT TO:

RONNIE

I'm here to become a police

officer.

POLICEMAN

We're always on the hunt for new

recruits. Do you have at least a

high school diploma?

RONNIE

I have a GED.

POLICEMAN

We usually prefer an actual

diploma, but GED is technically

acceptable. Are you a citizen of

the United States?

RONNIE

You bet your ass I am.

POLICEMAN

Okay, Mr. Barnhardt, there are

several steps you have to complete

in order to be eligible for the

police academy. Physical

evaluation, psychological test,

background check.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

73.

POLICEMAN (CONT'D)

If you pass these tests, you will

be admitted to the police academy.

Now, I like to tell all new

recruits that they should complete

a ride along before making this

decision. It's where you actually

ride along with a real police

officer during a routine patrol.

It helps give you an idea of the

kind of situations you'll be

dealing with. Sound good?

RONNIE

That sounds fun. Sign me up.

RONNIE

It's like it was meant to be. You

behind the wheel. Me riding shotgun.

Two brothers of the badge unite to

form the ultimate crime-stopping combo.

I'm psyched to be here, Harrison.

Thank you for the opportunity.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

You requested to ride along with me.

RONNIE

I know. You want to know the

truth. It's because I respect

you. See, when we're at the mall,

it's obviously my turf. Sure, I

break your balls about being a

rookie, but out here in the

streets, I'm the rookie. I'm here

to learn. Teach me.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Why do you want to become a Cop?

RONNIE

I've wanted to be a Police officer

all my life.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

74.

RONNIE (CONT'D)

Don't get me wrong, I love keeping

the mall safe, but you guys are

the ones that really enforce

justice and protect, not just our

mall, but our whole community. I

don't tell the guys on my squad

this, but the Security Guard job

was just temporary.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Well, just pay attention tonight

and make sure you stay out of the

way.

RONNIE

Right, we're not back at the

station anymore so we can cut the

charade.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

What are you talking about?

RONNIE

Well, I know that policy demands I

stay out of the way, but between

you and me, I just want you to

know that if anything pops off

tonight, I'm going to jump right

in there and take 'em down with

you.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

No, no. Ronnie, policy says you

have to stay in the car.

RONNIE

I get you. You have to say this

in order to keep you safe

'legally' speaking. I should

probably follow along too. 'I

swear I won't get out of the car

and fight justice tonight.'

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, you really can't.

RONNIE

I know.

(CONTINUED)

75.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I'm glad we understand each other.

RONNIE

Yeah, so then I basically saw his

ass trying to circumvent around

the ped exit and slip through the

employ exit. Not allowed. The

two ped exits are to be used

only --

DETECTIVE HARRISON

You see that corner there, Ronnie?

RONNIE

Yeah, I see it.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

That corner used to be the worst

corner in this whole town. It was

riddled with drugs, prostitution,

and gang violence. It was

nicknamed 'The Crossroads.'

RONNIE

Shit, I've heard of that.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

That's right, but myself and the

other officers worked on cleaning

it up for years so that the good

folks of this neighborhood

wouldn't have to worry about being

safe. Yes, sir, that corner is a

testament to the fine police work

of our force.

RONNIE

I don't know.    It looks pretty

shitty to me.

(CONTINUED)

76.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Well, it's a low income area,

Ronnie. You're being kind of

prejudiced.

RONNIE

Oh, yeah, I can see that it's

basically a fine neighborhood.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

That's right, but it hasn't been

easy. We still patrol this area

every night just to keep our

presence up.

RONNIE

I use that same technique at the

mall.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I'm sure. I usually do the foot

patrols myself, but because I like

you, I'm going to let you do it

tonight.

RONNIE

Really?

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Yeah,   really. But I told you

about   department policy, so I'm

going   to need you to keep quiet

about   this one.

RONNIE

You can count on me.     Thank you

for the honor.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Of course, Ronnie. I just really

believe in you.

RONNIE

I won't let you down.

(CONTINUED)

77.

RONNIE

Where are you going?!

CUT TO:

RONNIE

Hey, no horse play. You guys get

on home.

KID

You want some crack?

RONNIE

No, I don't want any crack. In

fact, I didn't want to do this,

but you leave me no choice in the

matter. I'm placing you under

citizen's arrest.

KID

Let me go, motherfucker!

RONNIE

I place you under citizen's arrest

for the crime of selling a

Schedule 1 Narcotic. You have the

right to remain silent...

(CONTINUED)

78.

RONNIE

... If you cannot afford an

attorney, one will be appointed to

you. Now I guess we just wait

here for my ride to come back.

GANG MEMBER #1

That's my little brother you got

there.

RONNIE

Who, this little guy right here?

GANG MEMBER #1

That's right.

RONNIE

Well, I hate to be the one to tell

you this, but it appears that your

little brother has tried to sell

me illegal drugs. I know it's

hard for you to hear that.

GANG MEMBER #1

He works for me, motherfucker!

RONNIE

Is that so? Well then, it looks

like you got one less employee

because I'm taking little brother

down. I'll die right here before

I let crime prevail.

RONNIE

(to the little Kid)

Free to go, little brother. My

mistake completely. Good luck

with the crack.

RONNIE

Alright, so I guess I'll be seeing

you folks.

(CONTINUED)

79.

GANG MEMBER #2

Yo, waste this pig, Tone.

RONNIE

Oh, no. That's really not

necessary, Tone.

GANG MEMBER #2

Do it, man.

RONNIE

Oh, Jesus, I don't want to die.

Don't let me die, don't do it!

RONNIE

No, please!   I'm sorry!

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

80.

COP #1

I can't believe you dropped him

off at the Crossroads. That's

fucking hilarious.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Trust me, you would have done the

same thing. This guy is without a

doubt the biggest fucking idiot I

have ever met.

COP #1

He's probably going to get killed.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Good! Fuck him, I hope he does

get killed.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, what are you doing here?

RONNIE

I know what you did!

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, look, I didn't do anything --

RONNIE

You're not going to talk your way

out of this one. You set me up!

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, look --

RONNIE

Don't try to deny it! You set me

up and that's all there is to it.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, I --

RONNIE

And I just want to thank you for

it.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Thank me?   Why?

(CONTINUED)

81.

RONNIE

Because I'm proud to report that I

passed the test. I know you

wanted to see if I had the chops

to cut it on the police force and

I'm glad to say that I passed. I

knew I would get initiated some

time, but I didn't think it would

be so soon. Thank you, Detective

Harrison. Thank you for believing

in me.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, I don't know what to say.

RONNIE

You don't have to say anything.

Your actions speak for themselves.

Thank you for giving this rookie a

shot. Get used to seeing Ronnie

Barnhardt around here, boys.

CUT TO:

82.

MARK

Come in.

RONNIE

Good morning, Mark.

MARK

Is it, Ronnie? I mean, the mall

is getting butchered in the press.

Somebody who works here is ripping

the place off. The cops don't

have any leads. I'm getting shit

from the owner of the mall. Sales

are down. I mean, what's so good

about this morning?

RONNIE

I feel your pain, Mark. Quite

frankly, there's two things

happening. One, I'm lacking a

sufficient firearm. And two,

we're understaffed. That's why I

come to you this morning with a

plan.

(calling to the door)

Come on in, Charles.

MARK

Who is this?

RONNIE

This is Charles, sir.

CHARLES

(BOUNCER)

How's it going?

MARK

You work at O'Charley's, right.

CHARLES

That's right.

(CONTINUED)

83.

RONNIE

Mark, I would like to hire Charles

here as an additional Security

Guard. He would operate under me.

I figure with the additional

criminal element, we should hire

more security in hopes that we

would have a better chance of

catching these guys.

MARK

Do you have any experience, son?

CHARLES

Not really.

RONNIE

Um, sir, I have personally been

training young Charles for weeks

now in preparation for this day.

The kid kind of looks up to me.

I'm some what of a big brother to

the little guy.

MARK

Alright, it's actually not a bad

idea. It might make our Security

more visible so we can give people

the illusion that we're on top of

this.

CHARLES

Thank you, Mark.

MARK

Ronnie, one more thing. Look, if

this crime doesn't come to an end

pretty soon, we're gonna have to

let someone go. I mean, you've

always done a great job for me,

but the truth is, someone is going

to have to take the fall. You're

the one who wanted to be Head of

Mall Security and quite frankly, I

just bought my wife a new

Cadillac, so let's just say it

won't be me.

(CONTINUED)

84.

RONNIE

With Charles on my team, I can now

devote more time to the robbery

and Pervert case. I plan on

having these wrapped up by the end

of the week.

RONNIE

Why'd you just laugh?

MARK

It's nothing.    Have fun, Ronnie.

RONNIE

Did I say something funny?

CHARLES

Let's go, Ronnie.

CHARLES

Be careful, guys. Nice and slow.

RONNIE

That's not bad, but you need to

learn to speak in a more

authoritative voice. Watch this.

Slow it down! Slow it down!

You've already received one

verbal, don't make me issue a

second!

(back to Charles)

See, you can't be intimidated.

You have to make them respect you.

CHARLES

Ronnie, you know I really want to

thank you for the job. You're a

man of your word.

(CONTINUED)

85.

RONNIE

No problem, my young student. So,

I got something to tell you. Keep

this between us until it's

official, but I don't think I'm

going to be here for much longer.

CHARLES

You're quitting? But you love

this job.

RONNIE

I do love it, but it looks like

someone is going to be joining the

police force.

CHARLES

The real police?

RONNIE

They're calling me up. It's

basically a done deal. Just a

little red tape is the only thing

keeping me from carrying a gun.

CHARLES

I didn't even know you wanted to

become a Cop.

RONNIE

It's always been my job. The Mall

thing is great training, but it

has its limitations. Some stars

are just meant to shine brighter

than others.

CHARLES

Congrats, brother.

RONNIE

(to a mall walker)

HEY, SLOW IT DOWN, LADY!

RONNIE

Nell?

NELL

Hey, Ronnie.

RONNIE

What are you doing?

(CONTINUED)

86.

NELL

Nothing, just getting in shape.

RONNIE

Well, that's okay, I guess.   Just

watch your speed, okay?

CHARLES

Isn't that your girlfriend?

RONNIE

Ex.

CHARLES

She looked good.

RONNIE

You think so?

CHARLES

She looks a lot better.

RONNIE

Yeah.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Okay, Ronnie, today I'll be giving

you a psychiatric evaluation to

determine if you're competent to

enter into the Police Academy.

It's really just a formality.

Don't want any serial killers

working for us, now do we?

RONNIE

No, ma'am, we don't.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Okay, Ronnie, so let's start with

your background. Where are you

from?

RONNIE

Born and raised right here.

(CONTINUED)

87.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Local boy. Okay, and, Ronnie,

have you ever been convicted of

any crimes?

RONNIE

No, ma'am.   My record is totally

clean.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Do you now take any illegal drugs

or have you taken any in the past?

RONNIE

No, ma'am. I believe drugs are

the path to self-destruction and

should be purged from the face of

the earth with ruthless vengeance.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Any prescription medications?

RONNIE

Yes, for my nerves. A man in my

line of work has a lot of stress

to deal with. If you've seen the

bloodshed I've seen, you'd be on

the meds too. I -- Where are you

going with this?

PSYCHOLOGIST

Are you presently or have you ever

been affiliated with the Communist

Party?

RONNIE

I can't believe you'd even ask me

that.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Have you ever been in the

military?

RONNIE

Yes.

PSYCHOLOGIST

What branch of the military were

you in?

RONNIE

The kind of branch that doesn't

exist on paper.

(CONTINUED)

88.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Okay, here's a real world

scenario. You have a gun --

RONNIE

Finally.

PSYCHOLOGIST

That wasn't really the question,

never mind, I think I got that

one. Um... here's one. Do you

feel like you would work well on a

team?

RONNIE

Would I? Yes. Would I be more

useful working alone, I would say

definitely. I see myself more

like a Rambo kind of guy. A man

who rolls solo. Taking care of

business on his own terms. Kind

of like a Superhero or something.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Why do you want to become a cop?

RONNIE

I want to become a cop to help

people. The world is a scary

place with lots of evil

everywhere. See, I have this

vision of evil trying to get at

the world from every angle and

there I stand at the top of it all

with my gun, just kind of blowing

it away. Just me and my weapons,

cleaning up this whole town. I

know I could do some good if I was

just given a chance and everybody

would be a lot better off.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Uh-huh. So, what do you feel is

the greatest danger facing a

police officer today?

RONNIE

Maybe Russian gang activity, but

you know what? I think I'm gonna

have to go with evil on that one

too.

(CONTINUED)

89.

PSYCHOLOGIST

Okay, I think we're good here.

It's been a pleasure, Ronnie.

RONNIE

Thank you, ma'am.

RONNIE

I'm telling you, Mom, this police

thing could be good for both of

us. Not just the fact that I'll

be making the streets safer for

you, but they have health

insurance and a pension plan so I

don't have to worry about your

medical bills as much.

MOM

I don't care about that bullshit.

All I need is a little nip of this

good shit right here and I'm ready

to walk through the pearly gates.

RONNIE

Mom, I know, but maybe you should

stop drinking so much. You're

getting up there and you know what

the doctor said about your liver.

MOM

I don't tell you how to party,

don't tell me how to live my life.

I've taken care of you since you

were born.

RONNIE

I just worry about you is all.

MOM

Ronnie, don't get your hopes up

about this police thing.

RONNIE

Why would you say that?

(CONTINUED)

90.

MOM

You know why. I just don't want

to see you get hurt. It's my job

to protect you from the bullshit.

RONNIE

Mom, I appreciate it, but I'm

going to make it as a police

officer. I'm tired of coming in

second all the time. Everybody in

life gets to go for their goals,

why should I be any different?

MOM

I know. Just be careful is all.

You've got a good heart and I

don't want to see it broken.

RONNIE

Okay, Mom.   I hear you.

MOM

And, Ronnie, one more thing.

RONNIE

What's that, Mom?

RONNIE

Mom!   That's gross!

MOM

(drunk laughing)

That's right! Now you got to

smell it!

RONNIE

Mom.

(CONTINUED)

91.

RONNIE

Ronnie Barnhardt reporting for

duty.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

I can see that. Listen, I don't

really know how to say this, but

we're not going to be able to let

you join the academy.

RONNIE

What?!   Why not?

DETECTIVE HARRISON

It seems you had a little trouble

passing the minimum requirements.

RONNIE

Did I fail one of the tests?

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Well, yes, actually, you failed

the psychological exam.

RONNIE

No!

DETECTIVE HARRISON

It says...

(reads from the form)

That Ronnie Barnhardt shows

warning signs of delusion and

allowing him to join the force

puts his life and the lives of

others in jeopardy.

RONNIE

Detective Harrison, you've got to

believe me. I'm completely sound.

This has got to be a mistake.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, I personally did your

background check and this is the

fifth time you've been turned down

for the police academy.

RONNIE

You guys keep records on that?

(CONTINUED)

92.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

We sure do. Look, I tried to talk

to them, but there's no way

they're gonna let you in. I'm

sorry, but your dreams of becoming

a Police Officer just aren't going

to happen.

RONNIE

I understand. Thanks for

believing in me, Detective. And

just for the record, I'm not

crazy.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Take care, Ronnie.

CUT TO BLACK.

93.

RONNIE

Hey, Nell.

NELL

Hey, Ronnie.   How's it going?

RONNIE

Can I talk to you for a second?

NELL

What is it?

RONNIE

I tried to get into the police

academy again and the same thing

happened.

NELL

Oh, Ronnie, I'm sorry.

RONNIE

Why does this keep happening to

me, Nell?

NELL

I don't know, Ronnie.    Maybe it's

just not meant to be.    Are you

okay?

RONNIE

No. Are you going home? I mean,

do you want to go somewhere and

talk or something?

NELL

Ronnie, I can't.

RONNIE

Why not?

NELL

I've got plans.

RONNIE

What plans?

SADDAMN

Look at this sorry piece of shit.

RONNIE

What the fuck do you want?

SADDAMN

I don't want anything from you.

(to Nell)

How you doing, sweetness?

SADDAMN

You look beautiful tonight.

RONNIE

What the fuck is going on?

SADDAMN

You ready to go? We got

reservations at 9:00.

NELL

I'm ready, Saddamn.

RONNIE

Nell, for the love of God, don't

go with him.

NELL

I'm sorry, Ronnie.

RONNIE

Don't go, Nell. Remember your

purity! Remember your purity!

STEVIE

What are you doing, Ronnie?

RONNIE

I'm just taking a break. What do

you want, Stevie? I don't have

time to fuck around with you

today.

STEVIE

I got something.

RONNIE

What the fuck is this?

DUDE

Dude, I found these all over the

mall. I'm guessing that whoever

this Mall Flasher is, left these

for girls to find.

RONNIE

This thing gets grosser and

grosser all the time. Well,

thanks for the clue. Maybe I can

use this to identify the freak.

You can skate all you want around

here.

STEVIE

What's wrong with you, Ronnie?

RONNIE

What do you mean?

STEVIE

I don't know.    You just seem kind

of sad.

RONNIE

Nah, man, I'm fine. I mean, I'm

catchin' perverts and protecting

this mall and just you know,

really livin' the dream.

STEVIE

That's cool.    Look, man, you want

to get high?

RONNIE

No, I don't want to get high.

STEVIE

That's cool.

(CONTINUED)

96.

RONNIE

And by the way, if I see you

getting high, I will call the

police and have your criminal ass

arrested. Don't you fuckin' ever

mistake my kindness for weakness.

I hate drugs and I hate you too.

STEVIE

Fine, you fucking dick.

BRANDI

Shhhh.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

What is it?

BRANDI

I thought I heard something.

(CONTINUED)

97.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

It's nothing.

RONNIE

HARRISON!!!

BRANDI

Shit!

DETECTIVE HARRISON

That motherfucker is crazy.

BRANDI

Well, you're the fucking cop.   Do

something.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

You're right.    Okay, here it goes.

BRANDI

What the fuck are you doing?!

(CONTINUED)

98.

BRANDI

Ronnie, it's me! Don't do

anything crazy.

RONNIE

Get back inside, Brandi. This

isn't about you... you... you

slut!

BRANDI

Fuck off, Ronnie.

RONNIE

How can you just stand there after

you ruined my life and act like

nothing happened?!

BRANDI

It's easy 'cause I don't give a

FUCK ABOUT YOU!

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Drop the flashlight, Ronnie.

RONNIE

You're pretty tough with that gun.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie, I know you've had a hard

time --

RONNIE

You were supposed to be my friend!

DETECTIVE HARRISON

So you're gonna kill Brandi?

RONNIE

I was just trying to scare her.

BRANDI

You don't scare me, you piece of

shit.

(CONTINUED)

99.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Ronnie!

RONNIE

Fine, fuck you! Fuck all of you!

And, Harrison, you better be glad

you have a gun or I'd kick your

ass too. And you know what? I'm

taking my friendship back because

you don't deserve it! And,

Brandi, I'm taking my love back

too. I'm gonna leave now and you

two can just have fun. Have fun

sleeping tonight because something

tells me, you won't be able to.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

That guy is a nut job.

BRANDI

Tell me about it.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

So you slept with him?

BRANDI

I was drunk okay. You gonna make

a big deal out of it.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

No, I guess not.

BRANDI

Fine.

100.

RONNIE

I'm disbanding the task force.

CHARLES

Hey, Ronnie, that's crazy talk.

Are you cool?

RONNIE

No, I'm not cool, Charles. In

fact, shit is seriously fucked up.

I've got to protect the whole mall

by myself. Now, I got you this

fucking job, when are you going to

stop being a little baby and do

something for a change.

(MOCKING)

'I don't want to do anything hard.

I just want to be a little bitch

and brag about dropping out of

college.' Grow a fucking pair,

will you, Chucky?

CHARLES

I'm gonna go check the parking

lot.

RONNIE

(calling out)

I'm sorry, Charles! I didn't mean

it, buddy!

RONNIE

You know, Dennis, for the longest

time I made this job my whole

life. I looked at this mall as a

kingdom and I looked at Mark as

the King. I thought of myself as

the first Knight and the

customers, well, they were the

peasants. I lived by an old code

where one was bound by duty and

honor. But now I don't know if I

believe in that code anymore.

I've lost my way. Now I just feel

like it's one big kingdom of shit.

Right now, I got half a mind just

to let this whole place burn.

Burn it to the fucking ground!

(CONTINUED)

101.

DENNIS

(high ghetto voice)

I've been waiting on you to get on

my page this whole time. You

look at this mall as a Kingdom?!

Shit! I look at this place like a

motherfucking jail sentence. You

put on that uniform every morning,

but what are you really protecting?

Commerce and corporations and money.

Well I say, fuck that! I'm

a fucking outlaw and I'm going to

live that until the day I die. Now,

I can show you the way, but you've

got to be willing to accept it. So

I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are

you ready for a trip to the other side?

RONNIE

You're goddamn right I'm ready.

DENNIS

Alright then.    Let's party.

CUT TO:

DENNIS

So, yeah, usually I take a joint

straight to the head before I

start work in this motherfucker,

but on really stressful days, I

like to get drunk too.

(CONTINUED)

102.

RONNIE

Fuck it, give me the bottle.

CUT TO:

DENNIS

So then I usually come in here and

perv out on girls for about an

hour or two. I hooked up twice

last week. One was this Asian

chick and the other was this mom.

She wasn't that hot, but what else

do I got to do?

DENNIS

Sweet Jesus in the morning.

DENNIS

Dressing rooms are a great place

to hide out, because nobody is

really going to think of looking

for me here. You can nap or just

kind of hang out and just really

have some personal time. Hey,

hand me that camera.

DENNIS

Thanks, Ronnie.

CUT TO:

103.

DENNIS

Right before lunch I usually blaze

up again real good.

CUT TO:

DENNIS

Hey, what's up, motherfuckers?!

STEVIE

What up, Big Den?!

DENNIS

You know, smokin' that good good.

STEVIE

Dude, why are you hanging out with

Ronnie?

RONNIE

Fuck you, Stevie!

DENNIS

Hey, Ronnie's alright.   Let me see

that stick.

BRANDI

That'll be $39.99.

MALE

My wife's gonna love this perfume.

BRANDI

I hope so.   It's my favorite.

(CONTINUED)

104.

DENNIS

Come on, brother. Let's go.

CUT TO BLACK.

MARK (V.O.)

(over the walkie)

Ronnie, we need you down at the

candy store. Some little brat has

been shoveling peanuts in his

mouth for the last hour.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

105.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO BLACK.

(CONTINUED)

106.

RONNIE

Dennis, I got to thank you for

today. Man, I was so down, but

you taught me that I don't need to

take things so seriously here. We

have a pointless existence. Who

gives a fuck?

DENNIS

Don't mention it, homey. I'm just

glad I got me a partner in crime.

RONNIE

A partner. I like that. You

know, I've never really had a

friend before, but I think that

this could be the beginning of a

real good thing.

DENNIS

You ain't even seen the best part.

After everybody leaves, I rob the

shit out of this place.

RONNIE

What do you mean?

DENNIS

I steal shit!

RONNIE

You're the one who's been robbing

the mall?

DENNIS

Hell yeah!   Who'd you think it was?!

RONNIE

I can't believe this. Right in

front of my goddamn face this

whole time!

DENNIS

This probably will look good with

my complexion.

RONNIE

Dennis, I can't take part in this.

(CONTINUED)

107.

DENNIS

Ronnie, I thought you were down?!

What the fuck?! Here I am opening

up myself to you and you're just

gonna stick it to me like this.

What the fuck has this place ever

done for you? Don't you know that

people see us as jokes?! A

useless tool that's left in the

shed. Well that's not me. Not

now, not ever. I told you, I'm an

outlaw.

RONNIE

I can't let you rob the mall.

DENNIS

What the fuck you mean you can't

let me?

RONNIE

Come on, Dennis. We're best

friends, so just put that stuff

back and let's go get a beer.

DENNIS

Alright, Ronnie, you're right.

DENNIS

I don't really know what I was

thinking. Robbing the mall?

Let's just go get that beer.

RONNIE

Good, man.   That makes me feel

better.

DENNIS

See ya in Mexico, bitch.

108.

CUT TO BLACK.

RONNIE

Ramon, get your ass over here! Go

get my spare keys out of the office.

RONNIE

Ramon! Goddamn it get back here!

Go get my goddamn keys.

MARK

How fucking stupid do you have to

be?! I mean Dennis. What the

fuck, Ronnie? How could you not

have known it was Dennis? Then,

how the fuck could you be so

stupid as to let him get away.

OBSERVE AND REPORT. Those are the

only two things you have to do and

you can't do those worth a shit.

RONNIE

Can I speak now?

MARK

Go ahead.

RONNIE

Are you sure?

MARK

Just start talking, Ronnie!

(CONTINUED)

109.

RONNIE

It seems only natural that 'some

people' would want to blame me and

truth be told I do put a lot of

that blame on myself. But some

people might say that the cops are

to blame for not catching them.

Some people might say that the

reason this happened was the

undeniable fact that I was under-

equipped and quite frankly,

lacking a sufficient firearm. But

not me. I carry this loss alone

deep inside my heart.

MARK

Good.   Because you're fired.

RONNIE

(PLAYFUL)

Fuck you.

MARK

I'm serious, Ronnie. I've always

liked you, but there's just no

excuse for this. Somebody is

going down and I'll be damned if

it's going to be me. Now, don't

make a big thing out of this.

Just pack your shit and get out by

the end of the day.

RONNIE

Wait a minute. I thought I could

trust you, Mark, and now you're

telling me that you're going to be

the one to put the knife in my

back. Fair weather friend you

are.

MARK

I'm not your friend, I'm your

boss.

RONNIE

You think you're so smart, Mark.

You don't know everything. If

you're firing me, then you can say

goodbye to your entire Security

staff. Because there is no

fucking way my team is going to

work here if you fire me. Isn't

that right, Charles?

(CONTINUED)

110.

CHARLES

Ronnie, I got to talk to you about

this. Mark asked me down here to

escort you out.

RONNIE

And you told him to fuck off,

right? Charles? Right?

CHARLES

What the fuck do you want from me,

Ronnie?

RONNIE

This isn't happening! Everybody

is fucking me over?! I hate you

all.

CHARLES

I'm sorry, Ronnie, but it's time

to go.

RONNIE

Wait a minute.     I'll work for

free, Mark.

MARK

No, Ronnie.

RONNIE

I'll pay you.

MARK

Nope.

RONNIE

I love you.

MARK

Ronnie, Jesus have a little self-

respect.

RONNIE

You don't love me, Mark?

MARK

Ronnie, it's over.

(CONTINUED)

111.

RONNIE

Hey, Charles. Mark asked you down

here in case I got out of hand?

Well, get ready to earn your

money.

MARK

Stop him!

CHARLES

Alright, Ronnie, that's enough.

MOM

What's on the agenda for today?

RONNIE

I guess maybe look for a job or

something.

MOM

Well, I know you're sad about it,

but try to look on the bright

side.

(CONTINUED)

112.

RONNIE

There is no bright side.   My life

is over.

MOM

Ronnie, you may not be smart or

handsome, but you've got dreams

inside of you and dreams make you

special. No matter what this

world tries to throw at you, they

can never take those dreams away.

RONNIE

What the fuck are you talking

about, Mom?

MOM

I don't know. I'm drunk. I just

know that mothers are supposed to

talk like that to their children

when they're sad, so I tried.

What do you want from me?

RONNIE

Nothing. That's exactly what

you're supposed to do. I just

blew my life. I tried to be a big

shot, a hero and a stupid cop. I

wanted to be recognized for being

great. I should have just been

happy where I was at. I didn't do

my duty.

MOM

Ronnie, the other night when I

soiled my pants right before I

puked myself, I was thinking about

how you would come home and find

me and clean me up. I knew you

would be there to find me and take

care of me, so I was able to pass

out on the floor and not worry.

If there's one thing you know

about, it's duty.

RONNIE

I do it because I love you.

MOM

I know and I love you too,   Ronnie.

I haven't always been easy   to deal

with and most people would   have

thrown me away a long time   ago.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

113.

MOM (CONT'D)

Just like your father did. But

not you, Ronnie. Look, whiskey

was always the way I dealt with

being a single mother, but as I

get older, I know that I can't

keep doing this. I've got

everything I need with you. So I

want you to know that I'm ready to

make a change. Your life needs to

get easier and you don't need to

take care of old Mom anymore.

RONNIE

Are you going to quit drinking?

MOM

I'm switching to beer. I can

pound those all day and still keep

my shit together. I'm doing it

for you.

RONNIE

I'm so proud of you, Mom.

MOM

I'm proud of you. Now today is a

new day and we're going to get

through it. Now, get out there

and find what the world has in

store for you.

DENNIS

What's up, Ronnie? How you doing?

(CONTINUED)

114.

RONNIE

I've been better. You?

DENNIS

I'm holding it down in here.

RONNIE

Yeah, I heard they finally caught

up with you.

DENNIS

I know. I should have hit Mexico,

but, you know, I got stoned and

just kind of kicked with this girl

in Kannapolis for a while.

RONNIE

You know they fired me when they

found out you were the one who

robbed the mall.

DENNIS

Shit, dog.    Sorry about that.

RONNIE

It's cool, but I need to know why

you did it.

DENNIS

I told you.   I'm an outlaw.

RONNIE

Come on, Dennis.

DENNIS

Man, you want to know the real

reason?

RONNIE

Yeah.

DENNIS

Alright, I'll tell you. Man, that

gig was one of the best jobs I

ever had. I got to wear a

uniform, I could smoke weed

whenever I wanted. For once in my

life, I felt like I was actually

somebody. I know most people

don't think it's shit, but I

really loved it. Then, all of a

sudden, I find out that your ass

got promoted over me.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

115.

DENNIS (CONT'D)

After all I put into it, you're

the one that makes it to Head of

Mall Security. You know what it's

like to get passed over, Ronnie?

So I got pissed off. I started

robbing the joint as a way to get

at them for what they did to me.

But you know what, Ronnie?

RONNIE

What's that?

DENNIS

You ever love a girl so much that

you can't break up with her, so

the only thing you can do when she

pisses you off is smack her in the

goddamn face?

RONNIE

No, Dennis, I haven't.

DENNIS

Well, I have. And that's pretty

much how I felt about the job.

RONNIE

Thanks for talking to me, Dennis.

DENNIS

Well, it's the least I could do

after knocking you out and all.

DENNIS

Hey, Ronnie.

RONNIE

Yeah, Dennis.

DENNIS

Bail me out of here, old friend.

RONNIE

I can't do it, Dennis. You're now

a criminal who stopped caring, but

my crime is that I care too much.

116.

CHARLES

Ronnie, what are you doing back

here?

RONNIE

I just came to talk to Nell.

Don't get your panties in a wad,

I'm just here as any normal

patron.

CHARLES

Ronnie, dude, I've been all fucked

up in the head. I feel like shit

about what happened. I mean, here

I am, just looking to shuck

responsibility and I ended up

hurting you in the process. Look,

I should have been honest with

you. I don't give two shits about

this stupid job. But you do.

RONNIE

It's okay, Charles.

CHARLES

I've decided I'm going back to

college. Getting stoned and

studying beats this any day. I

realize that now. I realize that

there aren't any jobs where you

can avoid hard choices. Anyway,

take as long as you want at the

mall. I'll keep Mark off your

back.

RONNIE

Thanks, Charles.

NELL

Ronnie, what are you doing here?

(CONTINUED)

117.

RONNIE

I got something I want to say.

NELL

I don't think we should be

talking.

RONNIE

I'll be quick. Nell, this is the

only job I was ever any good at.

I'm not a crime solver or right

hand of the law. I'm just a dumb

guy in a uniform who can't even

become a real policeman.

Somewhere along the way I started

to think I was something special,

someone whose shit didn't stink,

someone who deserved to date out

of my league. You know, I've

learned. My shit does stink. It

smells horrible. And you're also

out of my league, but for some

reason, you like the smell of my

shit. I guess what I'm saying

is...

RONNIE

If you give me another chance,

I'll spend the rest of my life

making it up to you. And you can

call me sweetie in front of people

and I'll like it.

RONNIE

Son of a bitch!!!

(CONTINUED)

118.

NELL

Oh, my God!

RONNIE

Are you alright?

NELL

I'm fine.

RONNIE

Shit, we should call somebody.

NELL

Ronnie.

RONNIE

Yeah?

NELL

Go get him.

He's trying to help.

Just do what I ask you.

Fuck yeah!

You want to report this to the

Hell no.   I'm taking him down

Good job, Ronnie.

RONNIE

Thank you, sir.

BRANDI

Good job, Ronnie.

I don't love you!

I don't love you either.

RONNIE

Fine.

I see that. Well, you better turn

him over to me and I'll take him

inside and book him.

DETECTIVE HARRISON

Hey, Ronnie, you may not be an

officer of the law, but you're the

law's right hand. Good job.

CUT TO BLACK.

RONNIE

What are you doing?!

NELL

You had an eyelash?

Sorry.

Okay, Ronnie, we're ready for you.

Okay, we rolling?

CAMERAMAN

(CONTINUED)

124.

FEMALE REPORTER

Good evening. We're here today

with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of

Mall Security here at Carolina

Mall. Last week, Ronnie was able

to catch The CAROLINA MALL FLASHER

single-handed and bring him to

justice. Ronnie, how did you

manage to find the identity of The

Pervert and take him down?

RONNIE

Well, being a mall security guard

basically requires the same skill

set that someone in say the FBI

has. You have to use logic and

evidence and old-fashioned common

sense as well as the latest

technology to deduce the criminal

mind. It's what I do.

FEMALE REPORTER

Any last words for the folks at

home.

RONNIE

Yeah, I'd just like to say that

Carolina Mall is back on track and

safer than ever...

RONNIE

In fact, there are some wonderful

sales taking place right now.

RONNIE

So for all you families out there,

come on down and see us. It's a

wonderful place.

RONNIE

THAT'S IT, YOU LITTLE SHIT!

FEMALE REPORTER

You heard it, folks. Everything

is back to normal here at Carolina

Mall. Back to you, Lindsay.
