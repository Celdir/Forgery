Life as a House - By Mark Andrus

LIFE AS A HOUSE

WRITTEN BY MARK ANDRUS

FADE IN:

COLLEEN

This is ridiculous!

ROBIN

Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.

RYAN

Why?

ROBIN

He'll be gone for his birthday.

ADAM

Can we have a party for him while he's

gone?

ROBIN

I hope you're showered and ready for

school!

ROBIN

Sam?!

GEORGE

Stick it up your ass!  Have a nice day.

(glancing around)

Guster!

COLLEEN

This has got to stop!

GEORGE

He escaped.  He's going back in.

COLLEEN

Does it give you some sort of perverse

pleasure to expose your...penis in plain

view of my sixteen year-old daughter?

GEORGE

There are no windows facing

my...exposure.

COLLEEN

George, this is the third time.

GEORGE

The plumber's due out on Friday.

COLLEEN

You'll have to explain that to the

police.

GEORGE

You were the only neighbor I could

tolerate.

COLLEEN

I did warn you.

GEORGE

My life is a warning.  I just can't

figure out for what.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Colleen, how hard was it for you to get

your head outside that window far enough

to see my dick?

ADAM

Sam broke his closet.

ROBIN

I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish

you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.

PETER

His father is a man.

ROBIN

A man he respects.

SAM

Thanks for talking about me behind my

back...useful in court.

PETER

Are you wearing eye shadow?

SAM

No.

PETER

Take it off.

PETER (CONT'D)

Do it now!

SAM

If I walk out the door, who's gonna be

here tonight for the follow through?

SAM (CONT'D)

Have a nice flight.

RYAN

Queer.

ROBIN

What did you say?

RYAN

Dad said it first.

ADAM

I get chocolate cake for your birthday.

PETER

Are your hands clean?

MAREK

Dude, nice look.

ALYSSA

I saw your dad this morning.

JOSH

Been thinking?

SAM

No.

MAREK

Forget him!

JOSH

Two hours a week for three-hundred cash.

The whole summer.  Do the math.

(as a dig)

They consider that a hatchback or a

station wagon?  Oh, that isn't yours

anyway, is it?

COREY

I was in total REM, man!

STEVEN

Done...close to done?

GEORGE

I'm doing the grass.

STEVEN

Fuck the grass.  Who said grass?

STEVEN (CONT'D)

Burke bided out the Berlin Plaza.  Did he

tell you?

GEORGE

I was going to start Monday.

STEVEN

He likes the look of the computer models,

anyway.  You take too long.

(beat)

After you mow the grass, would you mind

bringing the house to my office?  I have

a presentation to make.

FRIEND

I wouldn't make a habit of it.

ALYSSA

Okay.

GEORGE

You'll crap real logs if you keep eating

wood.

ALYSSA (O.S.)

Hi, Mr. Nelson.

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

Sorry I got you into trouble.

GEORGE

I'll survive.

ALYSSA

Does Sam have any friends?

GEORGE

He must.

ALYSSA

He seems lonely.

GEORGE

Are you his friend?

ALYSSA

No.

GEORGE

Why?

ALYSSA

Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into

guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue

eye shadow thing really isn't working.

KURT

Thought I'd run over the list.

ALYSSA

This is such a street of whiners.

KURT

From Tuesday to yesterday, not including

Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is

repeatedly running over her lawn.  The

Corliss' have attributed the increase in

rat population in their environs to the

state of your...structure.

ALYSSA

IPO's caused the rat population on this

street.

KURT

And of course the Beck's, with the...

ALYSSA

It could have been a squirt gun.

KURT

(to George)

You've been good this week.

GEORGE

You forgot David Dokos and Tom and

Barbara.

KURT

Mr. Dokos calls animal control for Guster

and I was out here on the other.

(pointing to the plane)

Do you mind?

ALYSSA

Are you guys' friends?

KURT

We've known each other since grade

school.

ALYSSA

I mean, but did you both go camping on

weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate

together?  Talk on the phone?

KURT

Hunted rabbit in the hills.

GEORGE

I aimed high.

KURT

We just weren't very much alike, I guess.

I don't know.

(casually; to George)

I liked your dad more than I liked you.

ALYSSA

I wouldn't want you as a friend.

KURT

George just never really...aimed that

high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I

knew you were doing that, by the way.

That's why I stopped doing it with you.

You were no fun.  It was always like you

were frightened.  Quiet and boring.

ALYSSA

Funny how he's the architect and you're

just a loud mouth cop.

KURT

He builds models for architects.  His

dad, on the other hand, was the real

deal.  Designed and built the coolest

houses I've ever seen.

GEORGE

Was bankrupt and dead before I was

twenty.

KURT

Left you this place.

GEORGE

It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it.

He stole it from everyone that deserved

it by putting me on title.

KURT

Do you know what I'd give to have this!

Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt

in this town.  I live in Riverside,

Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the

ocean.

KURT (CONT'D)

Your kid was down around Diver's Cover

again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him

up...told him I wouldn't tell you...

GEORGE

Thanks for telling me.

KURT

At least your father tried, George.

GEORGE (O.S.)

I could be anyone.

ROBIN

Then why do you stay you?

GEORGE

You should lock your doors.

ROBIN

Ring the bell before you try the door.

ROBIN (CONT'D)

Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be

over this weekend?

GEORGE

You let him pierce his nose?

ROBIN

Lock the door behind you.

GEORGE

Where is he?

ROBIN

Where he always is.

GEORGE

Not that I don't trust you.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I should have knocked.

ROBIN

What kind of a mother can't stand her

son?

GEORGE

I don't know.

GEORGE

Why aren't you coming in for the weekend?

(beat)

Sam?!

ADAM

Marco!

RYAN

What are you doing?

ADAM

I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!

ROBIN

What are you doing?

GEORGE

He doesn't answer.

ROBIN

He never answers.

GEORGE

Why does he have a lock on his door?

ROBIN

Because he put the lock on!  Do you think

I told him he could have a nose ring?!

Why do you ask me everything you should

ask him!?  I don't know anything,

anymore!

ROBIN (CONT'D)

You climb up there and tell him what he

can and can't do.  Take him for the

summer, okay?  Whip him into shape.  Cut

his hair.  Make him smile.  Let him hate

you for a while!

(sadly)

You're too late for heroics, George.

GEORGE

You need every brain cell you've got.

SAM

(half-asleep)

Leave me alone!

ROBIN

I don't know what to do, anymore.  Take

him.  You take him.

(hostile)

You're such a good father.

SAM

What are you doing in my room?

ROBIN

I didn't go in your room.

SAM

I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked

the door!  Get out!

SAM (O.S.)

Stupid bitch!  Liar!  I locked the door!

I don't sneak around your room!  Liar!

SAM

This is my room!  You have no right in

here!  This is mine!

SAM (O.S.)

Why can't you all just die and leave me

alone!

SECRETARY

Good morning.

GEORGE

Is there a...

BRYAN

George, have a seat!  I've got juice.

GEORGE

A bird caught me.

BRYAN

Orange juice...croissant?

GEORGE

I'm good, thanks.

BRYAN

What are you on?

GEORGE

Pardon me?

BRYAN

how much weight have you lost?

GEORGE

Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just

haven't been very hungry.

BRYAN

How's your wife?

GEORGE

When we divorce a decade ago, she was

very, very angry.

(beat)

Now she's just hostile.

BRYAN

Right...she married...what was he?

GEORGE

He buys and sells the world.

BRYAN

Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the

spotlight on that guy.

GEORGE

I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be

ready to start the Berlin model today?

BRYAN

Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're

not hungry?

BRYAN (CONT'D)

This isn't me.

(beat)

We can show clients endless options,

change anything in a matter of hours on

the computer.  But you won't change.

GEORGE

Typing and clicking myself to renderings

isn't why I started building models.

BRYAN

All of us are typing and clicking,

George.  Whether we want to, or not.

GEORGE

I'm not.

BRYAN

Which is why we bid out a quarter of our

projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense

anymore to want what we don't have and

don't want what we do.

GEORGE

I've been here twenty years.

BRYAN

Maybe that's too long.

GEORGE

(hopeful)

Maybe...?

BRYAN

That's too long.

BRYAN (CONT'D)

Listen, they decided on a week a year

severance, but I got them to twenty-six.

That's six months salary, George.

Medical and everything for six months.

You can learn all you need to on the

computer long before that.  Maybe find a

job closer to home.

GEORGE

My wife left me because I wasn't...very

emotional.  I kept trying to explain that

my father sucked all the emotion from me.

Drunks do that, sometimes.  Make their

kids afraid.  Make them unwilling to

express themselves.

BRYAN

Oh.

GEORGE

How old are you?

BRYAN

Forty.

GEORGE

We were probably in school together.  You

went to Berkley?

BRYAN

Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you

were there.

GEORGE

I was a sophomore when I got the call my

parents were dead.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

My dad had a blood alcohol level of .18.

A little high.  Drove right into oncoming

traffic.  Killed my mother with him.  A

lady in another car.  Hurt her daughter.

A five-year old girl.  I think about her

still.

BRYAN

Listen...maybe I can get you a year.

GEORGE

I hate this job.

BRYAN

What are you talking about?  You love

your job.

GEORGE

From the day I started...to today.  Can't

stand it.

BRYAN

Then it sounds like I'm doing you a

favor.

GEORGE

It may sound that way, but I react out of

fear.  My life has nothing to do with

what I like or don't like.  You haven't

been listening, have you?

BRYAN

I didn't know there would be a quiz,

George.

GEORGE

For everything.

BRYAN

Well, I feel better about this now.

GEORGE

Good.  I was hoping for that.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I've got one favor to ask.

BRYAN

What can I do for you, George?

GEORGE

I built my first model here when I was

twenty.  There are hundreds of them on

shelves around the office.  Twenty years

of my life.  I was wondering if I might

be able to pick a few to keep, to take

home?  Only the ones that really mean

something to me.

BRYAN

Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't

get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask

them if you could choose one.  But, you

know, frankly George, you were the best.

Computer models can't begin to match the

beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of

this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out

there and sometimes just stare at

something I've designed.  It amazes me.

I would miss that too much.

(beat)

Look, I may be going out on a limb, but

you go out there and look them over,

every single one of them and pick the one

you like the best and take it with you.

Just run it by me first, just in case,

you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.

GEORGE

Thank you.

BRYAN

Well, it's the least I can do.

GEORGE

Yes, it is.

STEVEN

Mother of God!  Not my house!

VOICE

Oh, please, please, no!

SECRETARY

Uh...Mr. Burke would like a word with

you, George.

GEORGE

Oh...okay.

SECRETARY

In his office.  When you're able.

GEORGE

Thank you.

GEORGE

I'll take this one, if that's okay?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Thank you for going out on a limb and

allowing me one.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You're a great architect and a miserable

human being.

BRYAN

Thank you.

BRYAN (CONT'D)

Oh, fuck!

BRYAN (CONT'D)

You're not even an architect and you're a

miserable human being.

GEORGE

You're right.  You win.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

That took care of the pain?

GEORGE

I could kiss you.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

No food.  I'm painless.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

What would you do if you had three or

four months to live?

NURSE

I'd eat a lot of red meat.

GEORGE

Good for you.

NURSE

What would you do?

GEORGE

I'd build a house.

NURSE

What kind of house?

GEORGE

You know what mortise and tenon is?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I've got every part of it ready.  It's

like a jig saw puzzle...all in pieces

now, just waiting to make sense.  I've

been through design and review...the

planning commission, city council.

NURSE

No one's really said four months is all

you have, have they?

GEORGE

Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They

haven't even pretended to offer

treatment.  You tell me, when would you

start eating red meat?

NURSE

Can you build a house in four months?

GEORGE

I can die trying.

NURSE

Good for you.

GEORGE

I haven't been touched in years.

NURSE

I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.

GEORGE

A handshake, or you know, someone pats

you on your back through clothes.

Doctors, people who have to touch you.

But not by people who want to.

NURSE

No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody

gets touched by someone they love.

GEORGE

Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a

little bit after my divorce, for four or

five years.  Six years.  I know when my

son was younger...maybe when he was ten

or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his

arms around me.

NURSE

Oh God, I'm married.

PATIENT

I'm hungry.

GEORGE

I'm touched.

ROBIN

I called everyone, everywhere!  You just

vanished!  You could be dead!

GEORGE

Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up.

You're loud today.

ROBIN

You're inconsiderate and absolutely

devoid of emotion!

GEORGE

You're the most beautiful woman I have

ever known in my life.

ROBIN

What?

GEORGE

I'm not talking just physically.  Even

your anger is perfect.

GEORGE

I didn't think you'd know I went missing.

ROBIN

You didn't think someone from your office

would call and tell me you wrecked the

entire building and threatened people

with a baseball bat?!

GEORGE

A blueprint spool.

ROBIN

Where have you been for a week?!

GEORGE

Four days.  I left to think.

ROBIN

What did you do with your dog?

GEORGE

Kurt's been feeding him.

ROBIN

But you can't call me while you think?

GEORGE

I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I

didn't think to call you while I

thought...I think.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I need to talk to you.

ROBIN

Why would they tow your truck?

GEORGE

I was parked in day parking.

ROBIN

Why call me?

GEORGE

I'm going to tear down the shack and

build my house.

ROBIN

You've been saying that for twenty years.

While we were dating, you said it.

GEORGE

There's nothing anymore to stop me.

ROBIN

Money?

GEORGE

Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in

my life insurance policy.

ROBIN

How many years did I live with your beams

and boards?  First in the garage, then in

the living room.  We're going to do it,

Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged

floorboards from a house in Pasadena.

Doors from a church in New Hampshire...

GEORGE

I love those doors.

ROBIN

Where will you live?

GEORGE

The garage.

ROBIN

Look, I wasn't serious about you taking

Sam, so you don't have to get into any

actual construction to get out of it.

GEORGE

When's school over?

ROBIN

Friday...God, I hate the thought of him

home all day.

GEORGE

I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.

ROBIN

He doesn't want to spend the weekends

with you anymore.

GEORGE

Not for the weekend.  For the summer.

ROBIN

You and Sam are going to live in a garage

without plumbing for the summer?

GEORGE

The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a

toilet.  We'll survive.

ROBIN

Thank you for at least sounding sincere.

GEORGE

Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap

labor.

ROBIN

One of you would end up dead.

GEORGE

At least we'll have a house to show for

it.

ROBIN

Forget it, really.  I'll survive.

GEORGE

I want him with me.

ROBIN

No, you don't.  Trust me.

GEORGE

I want Sam for the summer.

ROBIN

Okay.

GEORGE

Hey, hey!

ROBIN

I'm married.

COREY

The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.

SAM

I don't know.

COREY

It'll just be my brother the dweeb on

weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and

paint the cabin, dude.

(boasting)

My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my

charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income

village is the place to hook up with

hump.

SAM

I'll ask.

COREY

Hey, it beats letting town folk go down

on you for the summer.

SAM

I never said anything.  I haven't done

anything.

COREY

I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp.

I'm not stupid.

SAM

You don't know what the deal is.  There

is no fucking deal.

ALYSSA

Hi, Mr. Nelson.

GEORGE

Alyssa.

ALYSSA

Why have you put a toilet and a bed in

your garage?

GEORGE

I'm living here while I build another

house.

ALYSSA

Is that legal?

GEORGE

Don't you have school?

ALYSSA

Nope.

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

Are these clean?

GEORGE

What's today?

ALYSSA

Monday.

GEORGE

My keys.

ALYSSA

What's that?

GEORGE

Nothing.  I cut myself.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I had them in my pocket.

ALYSSA

I'm not shaving my legs or pits this

summer, I've decided.

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

Paula Cole isn't a vertical kisser.

GEORGE

Make the bed for me, would you?  I gotta

run.

COLLEEN (O.S.)

What are you, forty?

GEORGE

I forgot where I put my keys.

COLLEEN

And you thought they might be under her

dress?

ALYSSA

I was just showing him my hair.

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

I think you need to rethink what you

think of me.

GEORGE

Her leg hair.

LOIS

Mrs. Webber is in the backyard.

GEORGE

And Sam?

LOIS

In his room, packing.

GEORGE

Oh...Good.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Sam!

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Ready?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I think you'll have fun this summer.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Don't forget your headphones.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Would you mind turning it down?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

It won't all be work, you know?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

It won't be all work, you know!

SAM

I heard you already!

GEORGE

Your mom and the boys can drop by

anytime.

SAM

To check up on me?

GEORGE

I'll be around to check up on you.

SAM

Why would you be there?

GEORGE

Because I live there.

SAM

You live in Cory's parents' cabin?

SAM

No fucking way!!!

SAM (CONT'D)

You liar!  You stupid liar!  I hate you!

GEORGE

Did you tell him he's spending the summer

with me?

SAM (O.S.)

No I'm not!

ROBIN

What was I supposed to do?  When you

didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call.

Your phone isn't working.

GEORGE

I don't have a phone.

ROBIN

I drove over and you were gone.

GEORGE

I can't leave the house?

ROBIN

Last time you were gone for a week!

GEORGE

Did you tell him he was spending the

summer with me?

ROBIN

No.  I was going to let you do that.

GEORGE

He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.

SAM

Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know

you.

GEORGE

You'll know me by the time we're through.

SAM

I'm not going!

GEORGE

I'll get your bag.

SAM

Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already

promised me!

GEORGE

You have everything?

ROBIN

I did say he could go.

GEORGE

Let's go.

SAM

I'm not going!

GEORGE

You don't have a choice.

SAM

Mom...please.

ROBIN

George --

GEORGE

(adamant)

He's not spending the entire summer with

another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I

will follow him up there and I will drag

him home by his nose ring.  He can hate

me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill

me while I sleep.  You can call the

police.  You can call your husband or

your attorney, but Sam is spending the

summer with me.  He's my son.  He's

sixteen.  That's it.

ADAM

Can we hate you?

GEORGE

You can do anything you want.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Go get in the truck, Sam.

SAM

Go fuck yourself!

GEORGE

Your nose ring comes out of your nose.

If you've got them in your nipples, they

come out, too.  And there's no make-up at

my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing.

No pills, no grass.

SAM

If you hit me, I'll call the police.

GEORGE

You've worn out your welcome at this

house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.

(beat)

This may well be the worst three months

of your life, but you've earned it.  So,

pick up your suitcase and go get in the

truck.  Now.

SAM

I'll hate you forever.

GEORGE

You can't even begins to know how much I

hate my father.

(upbeat)

Think of it as a family tradition.

GEORGE

Sam?  I'm...for like three minutes?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

That's okay.  If I break my back, daddy's

gonna buy you a naval ring.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

And if that naval ring don't fit, daddy's

gonna rub you down with the sun screen.

GEORGE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I want you wearing sun block.  And I want

you down here to help me.  Now.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

It works on Guster.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You're in there not helping at all,

aren't you?

GEORGE (O.S.)

You know what else helped Guster?

Neutering.

GEORGE

Do you want garlic bread?!

SAM

Well, get over here, then, stupid.

SAM (CONT'D)

Are you afraid of heights, Guster?

SAM (CONT'D)

The fall probably wouldn't kill me,

anyway.

GEORGE

Thinking of jumping?

SAM

Pushing.

GEORGE

Only jump after you hear the wave crash

against the rock.  The water will take

you out.  Let it.  Swim a little North

and you'll see the sand.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

First time I did it, younger than you, I

thought I'd break my neck and just sort

of float to Catalina.

(beat)

You don't always get what you wish for,

Sam.

SAM

Oh, shit!

SAM (CONT'D)

Hello?

SAM

Are you totally insane?!

GEORGE

I almost saw Catalina.

SAM

Guster!

SAM (CONT'D)

You're so busted, dude.

SAM (CONT'D)

Where's my dinner, huh?

SAM (CONT'D)

I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate

my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?

ALYSSA (O.S.)

Hi.

SAM

Hey.

ALYSSA

What are you doing here?

SAM

They're trying to make me spend the

summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.

ALYSSA

Where to?

SAM

I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.

ALYSSA

Your dad's really gonna build his house?

SAM

I don't know.

ALYSSA

Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see

you.

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

You should stay.

SAM

I don't know.

ALYSSA

Where's your dad?

SAM

He jumped into the ocean.

ALYSSA

Tell him I said "hi".

SAM

I'm not taking a dump with you in here.

SAM (CONT'D)

My brothers say it's the worst smell

they've ever smelled.

SAM (CONT'D)

I think you have to have a door between

where you cook and where you crap.  Like

even in the bush, tribal people and like

that have a place for both.  It's like a

law.

GEORGE

Which side of the bed do you want?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Just kidding.  The sofa's a pullout.

SAM

Probably in the bible.

GEORGE

Goodnight.

SAM

I have to take a dump.

GEORGE

Have you got sunscreen on?

BARBARA

It's about time this shack is torn down.

TOM

Oh, hello George.

GEORGE

Guess how many low-income apartments the

city approved for this lot?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Come on...ballpark figure.

SAM

What are you doing?!

GEORGE

I warned you yesterday.

SAM

Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!

ALYSSA (O.S.)

Hey, you stayed.

GEORGE

Rub him down, please.

SAM

He's a freak.

ALYSSA

You look better without make-up.

SAM

I can't even take a shower here.

ALYSSA

Come over to my house whenever you want.

I'll tell my mom.

SAM

I might not stay, anyway.

ALYSSA

I'll get your back.

SAM

No.  That's okay.

ALYSSA

Have you ever had anyone but your mom or

dad put it on for you?

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

It's weird how different it is.  Lay

down.

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

Do you remember me from when you lived

here?

SAM

Yeah.

ALYSSA

Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.

SAM

Really?

ALYSSA

I wanted him to marry her.

SAM

Why?

ALYSSA

Turn over.

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

Josh and I are going to South Coast.

Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?

SAM

No thanks.

ALYSSA

Don't forget your front.

GEORGE

She's pretty...for a girl.

GEORGE

Do you ever get like the slightest

inkling that you might want to help me

instead of doing absolutely nothing?

SAM

No.

GEORGE

Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired

of your attitude.

SAM

I hate turkey.

GEORGE

No you don't.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I want you to take out your nose ring and

leave it out.

SAM

Why?

GEORGE

It bugs me.

SAM

You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I

take you out?

GEORGE

Your brothers are right.  It was the most

god-awful smell I've ever had my nose

around.

ROBIN

Thought you guys might be hungry.

GEORGE

We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.

ROBIN

Well, for later then.

ROBIN (CONT'D)

It makes me sad.

GEORGE

What?

ROBIN

I used to live here.

GEORGE

But you hated four out of the five you

did.

ROBIN

I was here six years.  And I only hated

two.

GEORGE

Which?

ROBIN

The first and the last.

GEORGE

I don't even like turkey sandwiches.

What kind of pizza?

ROBIN

Sam's favorite.

ROBIN (CONT'D)

(to Sam)

Sure you don't want any?

ROBIN (CONT'D)

You're too thin, George.  From what you

used to be, anyway.

GEORGE

Why the first and the last?

ROBIN

The first because I wasn't sure you

really loved me...the last because I

wasn't sure I really loved you.

GEORGE

I was up on the roof this morning,

tearing it down and it struck me as

strong as anything ever has.  That I'm

happy today.

ROBIN

What have you been before today?

GEORGE

It was just that, maybe the way the sun

struck the ocean, the sound of the waves.

It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I

started thinking about the last time I

felt this good.

(beat)

It's been a long time.

ROBIN

Do you remember?

GEORGE

The only time I can think of for sure, I

was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving

him from the waves.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You head was pressed against my chest.  I

could feel your heart racing.  And I

remember I kissed your hair.

ROBIN

We have it on video!  Was that when?  My

parents were down for his sixth birthday!

I remember that.

SAM

I have to go.

GEORGE

What is it?

ROBIN

I'm fine.  Nothing.

(beat)

I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.

GEORGE

I don't know.

SAM

I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some

money.

GEORGE

You'll have money when you work.

SAM

You're so predictable.

SAM (CONT'D)

You haven't been happy in ten years?

SAM

No one would blame me if I left!

GEORGE

I'd blame you.  I want you here.

SAM

I'm not doing it!

GEORGE

It'll be fine.

SAM

Why don't you just beg some money off my

dad and move into something decent with a

real kitchen and a real bathroom?

GEORGE

I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I don't beg.

SAM

And I don't take a shower in the middle

of the yard.

GEORGE

I can promise you complete privacy.

SAM

You can't promise me anything!  You don't

have anything to promise!  You live in a

garage!  You don't have cable!  You're

not hooked up to the internet because you

don't even own a computer!  You don't

have a job!

GEORGE

This will save you from prying eyes.

SAM

If you had a stupid phone or I could use

your truck, mom would give me some money.

GEORGE

You'll have money when you work for it.

SAM

Is Alyssa home?

COLLEEN

She's out with a friend.

SAM

Oh...do you know when she'll be home?

COLLEEN

She didn't really say.

SAM

Oh...okay.

COLLEEN

Sam?

SAM

Uh huh.

COLLEEN

I didn't recognize you!

SAM

I'm sorry.

COLLEEN

Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing

over there.

SAM

Not a shower.

PETER

The goddamn traffic.  Were we going out

to dinner?

ROBIN

We've eaten.

PETER

Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.

ROBIN

I'll make you something.

PETER

Did someone call to tell you I'd be late?

JOSH (O.S.)

Bro, I need you tonight.

SAM

I locked the door.

JOSH

It'll take you like twenty, thirty

minutes.

SAM

Does Alyssa know?

JOSH

Nothing.

SAM

You got any weed?

JOSH

You got the money?

JOSH (CONT'D)

Alyssa sent me up to see if you wanted to

hang around and watch a movie with her

and her mom.

GEORGE

Ah!  Oh....

KURT (O.S.)

I know there's an explanation.

GEORGE

No hot water.

KURT

Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and

a boy are squatting illegally in the

garage of your house.

GEORGE

Check the permits.  It was built as a

guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit

grandfathered when South Laguna was

incorporated.

KURT

Now that should be illegal.

SAM

Thanks for the shower.

COLLEEN

I want you both to stay.

ALYSSA

And candy too.

JOSH

I'm gonna give him a ride in my car.

ALYSSA

I'll see you tomorrow.

COLLEEN

Come over anytime you need to, Sam.

SAM

Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.

KURT

I'm surprised he hasn't left.

GEORGE

I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet

him down once.  Why would he leave?

SAM

I'm leaving.

GEORGE

Hey...hey!

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Where are you going?

SAM

I don't know.

GEORGE

When are you going to be back?

SAM

I don't know.

GEORGE

Well, until you know, you can't go.

SAM

Oh, okay.

GEORGE

I'm not very good at it.  Parenting.

PETER

I hope your ex-husband is equipped for

the havoc of Sam, because it seems

absolutely blissful here tonight.

ROBIN

Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug

you?

PETER

Should I?

ROBIN

It would worry me.

PETER

If I let everything that should worry me,

worry me, I'd be dead from worry.

ROBIN

What would you be if you asked Adam and

Ryan to run in now and hug you?

PETER

I'd be you.

PETER (CONT'D)

I'll do it if that's what you want.

JOSH

You don't have to do a thing.  Just get

in and get out.  As quick as you can.

Close your eyes and think of whatever.

SAM

What's your deal with Alyssa?

JOSH

Don't even...I'm there.

SAM

I wasn't sure.

JOSH

She wouldn't even fucking go out with

until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's

not even a rule, just her own thing.  She

like figures things out on her own and

then that's it.

JOSH (CONT'D)

If this rings, run.

JOSH (CONT'D)

He already knows everything about what he

can't do.  You can tell him not to even

look at you, if you want.

SAM

I'm thinking it's too weird now.

JOSH

It beats working.

JOSH (CONT'D)

Inhale and get out.

OFFICER

What did you toss into the brush?

JOSH

Nothing.

OFFICER

Turn off the music!

JOSH

Oh, it's working now.

OFFICER

What did you toss into the brush?

ROBIN

Lunch.

GEORGE

It's not breakfast yet.

ROBIN

I dreamed about your house last night.

GEORGE

Finished or unfinished?

ROBIN

It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was

so real.

GEORGE

Didn't you once dream you could lick

people well, though?

ROBIN

That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.

GEORGE

Oh...with his ear infection!

ROBIN

My tongue around the edge of his ear is

what cured him.

GEORGE

Go in there and lick his attitude.

ROBIN

The antibiotics weren't working.

(beat)

It's what I believe, George.

GEORGE

You were wrong about the first year, you

know?

ROBIN

I've been wrong a lot in my life.

GEORGE

Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a

future.

ROBIN

I have three hours before I pick up Adam

and Ryan.

(beat)

Where will I be most useful?

GEORGE

With your hands or your tongue?

ROBIN

You're not well.

GEORGE

Good morning.

ROBIN

I'm late.

ROBIN (CONT'D)

Ryan has a game later.  He asked if you'd

come and watch.

BOB

Mr. Stevens?

GEORGE

I've been dreading you.

BOB

Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an

unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a

kitchen?

GEORGE

A violation?

BOB

Oh, yes.

GEORGE

And if I enclosed it?

BOB

An exhaust system or a window is code.

GEORGE

A sink?

BOB

Allowed outside the enclosed area.

SAM

Where is it?

GEORGE

A friend of yours is here.

SAM

Did you got through my pants?

GEORGE

I might have a solution.

SAM

Where'd you put it?!

SAM

I know you took it.  I want it now!

GEORGE

Doors.

BOB

I hate to ask about a window.

GEORGE

(to Sam)

I flushed it down the toilet.

SAM

No!  Oh my God!

SAM (CONT'D)

If I had a gun, I'd kill you.

BOB

I assume you'll fill the...uh, window,

with glass?

GEORGE

If that's what it takes.

SAM

What's in my pants is none of your

fucking business!

BOB

(a little rattled)

I would say you're in compliance.

GEORGE

I hope that makes the pain in the ass

that called you happy.

BOB

You and me both.

GEORGE

Everything about you is my business.

What you smoke, what you swallow, what

you sniff, it's all my business.

SAM

I've been using since I was twelve!

You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You

didn't give a shit about anything I did

until now!

GEORGE

I'll apologize for everything but

today...Today I give a shit.

SAM

You're too fucking late.

GEORGE

The gloves on the table are for you.

SAM

You can't make me do a thing.

GEORGE

Sit down for a second.

SAM

No.

SAM (CONT'D)

I'll call the cops if you touch me again!

SAM (CONT'D)

Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child

abuse.  People go to prison for what you

just did to me.

GEORGE

My dad used to play a game.  I never

really understood what it was until after

he was gone.

SAM

I was holding for someone.  That wasn't

even mine.

GEORGE

The game was to make me smaller than he

was.  No matter what.  He could be almost

invisible as a human being, but I had to

be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I

was a pussy for not playing football.  If

I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short

enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a

psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once.

And if he couldn't make me smaller with

words...

SAM

I'll have to pay him back.

GEORGE

I won't ever hit you.

(beat)

I don't want you smaller.  I want you to

be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me.

Not home with your mother.  Not up in

Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.

(beat)

You're what I was most of my life, Sam.

I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep.

In your answer to everything.  You're

barely alive.

SAM

I'm not even listening.

GEORGE

You know that great thing, though?  Is

that change can be so constant you don't

even feel the difference until there is

one.  It can be so slow that you don't

even notice that your life is better or

worse, until it is.

(beat)

Or it can just blow you away.  Make you

something different in an instant.  It

happened to me.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Build this house with me.

SAM

I have to pay back what you flushed down

the toilet.

(beat)

I want ten dollars an hour...then I'm

done.

GEORGE

It all has to come down before we can

start again.

(beat)

Knock it down.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

I hated this house from the second my

father cheated everyone and put it in my

name.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Twenty years of hating what you live

in...what you are.  This is the end of

it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me

here that I can be proud to give to you.

SAM

Don't.  I don't want it.

GEORGE

Do whatever you want with it.  I don't

care.  All I want from you is for you to

remember we built this house together.

SAM

We haven't build shit.  You're just

tearing down your father.

GEORGE

Try it.  It feels good.

ROBIN

It's morning, sleepyheads!

RYAN

Why do we have to get up and eat with you

this early?

ROBIN

I just thought it would be nice.

ADAM

Are you going to see Sam again?

ROBIN

I thought I might stop by.

RYAN

All day again?

ROBIN

Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.

ROBIN (CONT'D)

You can go back to bed...or Lois might

let you go swimming.

ADAM

I wanna be with you today.

ROBIN

Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there.

I mean, it's all work.

ADAM

We can work.

ROBIN

Ryan, would you rather swim or work?

RYAN

Can we really help build a house?

PETER

Why is everyone up so early?

COLLEEN

If she's not up, you can use my shower.

SAM

Thank you.

COLLEEN

You're here early today.

SAM

We're getting out of the ground today.

ALYSSA (O.S.)

Huh?

SAM

I can use your mom's.

ALYSSA (O.S.)

I'm okay.

ALYSSA

Were you with Josh when the cops arrested

him?

SAM

(nervously)

Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?

ALYSSA

His parents took his car.  They're making

him ride a bicycle the rest of the

summer.

SAM

Really?

ALYSSA

He asked me to tell you that you owe him

a hundred dollars.

SAM

He can peddle over anytime he wants to

for it.

ALYSSA

This is serious!  I don't have my

license.  He was my ride.

SAM

I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.

SAM

Is this like a past time with people?  Go

away!

ALYSSA

I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big

thing for me.

SAM

Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.

ALYSSA

I'm coming in.

SAM

I don't want you to!

ALYSSA

We're not gonna do anything.

SAM

Why are you so stupid?

ALYSSA

Why are you so uptight?

SAM

I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't

even know what that means.

ALYSSA

It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and

stay out of your way.

SAM

Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.

ROBIN

I thought you'd be up with the sun.

GEORGE

My stupid back.

ROBIN

Do you need anything?  I'll go to the

pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.

GEORGE

No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.

ROBIN

Where's Sam?

GEORGE

He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

You brought your kids?

ROBIN

I kind of said that maybe they could do

something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They

really wanted to come.  I really wanted

to come and they wanted to be with me.  I

don't think they'll be too much trouble.

GEORGE

I'll find something that won't kill them.

ROBIN

Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and

fingers.

GEORGE

You're a good mother.

ROBIN

Do you need help?

GEORGE

I think so.

ROBIN

I woke up this morning at three and

couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I

think I see more of Sam than I've seen in

years.

ADAM (O.S.)

Sam!

SAM

Hey.

SAM (CONT'D)

What's that for?

ADAM

Mom said I should.

SAM

Oh.

ADAM

I would have anyway.

ADAM (CONT'D)

Who are you?

ALYSSA

Who are you?

ADAM

I'm his brother.

ALYSSA

I'm his friend.

ADAM

Mom says we can build a house.

ALYSSA

Hi, Mr. Nelson.

GEORGE

Hi, Alyssa.

SAM

Hi, Mom.

ROBIN

Good morning.

ALYSSA

Hello.

ROBIN

You're so nice to let Sam use your

shower.

ALYSSA

He's got a standing invitation.

SAM

Hey, Ryan.

RYAN

Hey.

SAM

So, you wanna build a house?

RYAN

If we do, will it stay up?

ROBIN

I brought a few of my own.

RYAN

Someone stop her!

GEORGE

It's been a while.

ROBIN

This was my very first slow dance.

ADAM

Did you know him before you knew Dad?

ROBIN

Since seventh grade.

GEORGE

Tell him how you made me fall in love

with you.

ROBIN

I smiled at him.

GEORGE

Watch out for the smile, boys.

ROBIN

Who's up for a dance?

ADAM (O.S.)

Just don't hug me too tight.

ADAM (CONT'D)

That's all you get.  I'm busy today.

ROBIN

Let's see if you've gotten any better.

GEORGE

Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.

ALYSSA

I'll see you tomorrow.

RYAN

When did you fall in love with my dad?

ROBIN

When I found out I was pregnant with you.

SAM

I took some of your Vicodin.

GEORGE

I know.

(beat)

Why?

SAM

I like how it feels not to feel.

GEORGE

I know the feeling.

SAM

How do you become something you're not?

GEORGE

What would you like to be?

SAM

What I'm not.

GEORGE

What are you now?

SAM

Nothing.

GEORGE

That's not true.

SAM

See, that's the thing...I am what I say I

am.

GEORGE

I know parts of who you are.

SAM

What do you know about me?

GEORGE

When you started first grade and your mom

went to work, it was so she could save

for an apartment.  But then she met Peter

and skipped the idea of renting.

SAM

He's got nothing to do with me.

GEORGE

I couldn't imagine how I could compete

with him for any part of you.  So, I

didn't.  He wanted you to have his last

name...I let him even take that.

SAM

He was a prick when I was six, and he's a

prick today.

GEORGE

I wish you had told me then.

SAM

I'm telling you now.

GEORGE

I gave up on you.

SAM

I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had

given up.

GEORGE

What would you be doing now?

SAM

Getting high, I guess.

GEORGE

If I asked you to stop, would you?

SAM

I haven't used anything for two days.

I'm trying.

GEORGE

I'm proud of you, Sam.

SAM

Don't be.  And hide whatever that new

drug is you have.  I like it.

GEORGE

I put a gun to my father's head once.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Have you ever thought like that?  I've

been thinking...watching you work.  How

much do you hate me?

(beat)

He was passed out.

Just screaming at my mother before.

About nothing.  Under-cooked meat.  I

went back to my room... put the barrel

close to his ear and chickened out again.

Not my dad.  Hid in my room.  Not even

me.

(beat)

Of course it was a BB gun.  But it still

would have hurt like hell.

SAM

Are you talking?

GEORGE

I was just thinking about my mom.  She

wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time

she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I

mean it was dark outside and in.  But we

never talked about it.

SAM

Sun glasses?

GEORGE

To hide a black eye.

SAM

Why wouldn't she leave?

GEORGE

I think she was terrified of living with

him...but maybe even more terrified of

life without him.

SAM

I would have killed him.

GEORGE

Everything would have been better if you

had.  You'd have liked your grandmother.

And there'd be a girl out there that'd

have her mother.  I remember reading

about her in the paper.  They couldn't

find her father and her mother was dead.

I still feel guilty about that.

SAM

Do you ever wish you had done it?

GEORGE

I loved him too much.

SAM

After everything he did to you and your

mom?

GEORGE

After everything.

SAM

That's so weird...

COLLEEN

Is anyone hungry?

ADAM

I like the color I'm making the doors.

GEORGE

The absolute best color I've ever seen in

my life.

RYAN

How many bedrooms will your house have?

GEORGE

Three.

ADAM

Will Sam live with you or us?

GEORGE

With you.

SAM

So put your plans of my room in the

trash.

ADAM

I don't think Dad wants you home.

ROBIN

Adam, that's not true!

RYAN

Yes, it is.

ROBIN

Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your

father wants Sam home as much as I do.

ROBIN (CONT'D)

It wasn't meant to be...

GEORGE

I love you!

PETER

You know what I've decided?

ROBIN

To shave your chest?

PETER

We should take a vacation.

ROBIN

The biggest waste of time since

television.

PETER

Do you remember anything I've said that

wasn't negative?

PETER (CONT'D)

Just the two of us.

ROBIN

I'd love to drive through New England in

the Fall.

PETER

Sooner than the Fall.

ROBIN

After the kids are back in school.

PETER

Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn

them off on your parents.

ROBIN

I'm helping George build his house.

PETER

What?

ROBIN

I've been helping for the last few days.

Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam

was working.  I mean, he really is.

PETER

Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't

stand him and George needed help.

ROBIN

I can't go right now.

PETER

You can't go because of Sam?

ROBIN

We haven't been away together for three

years.  What difference does a few months

make?

PETER

You can't go with me because of Sam?

ROBIN

Sam is working at something for the first

time in his life.  Once in a while he

even talks to me.  I want to be around

for that.

PETER

So am I, Robin.  I'm working at

something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do

you want to be around for it?

ROBIN

I don't know.

PETER

I was talking about our marriage.

ROBIN

I know.

SAM

What's the point of this?

ALYSSA

Does everything have to have a point?

SAM

It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not

really supposed to touch you, but I can

look.

ALYSSA

Are you sure you're totally into guys?

SAM

What are you talking about?

ALYSSA

Josh said...

SAM

I'm not gay.

SAM (CONT'D)

I mean, hello!

ALYSSA

I was wondering.

SAM

You're driving me crazy!  Do you know

what it's like trying to jack-off in an

armoire?

ALYSSA

Not really.

SAM

You're off, you know?  You're way, way

off.

ALYSSA

I thought I was helping you.

SAM

It would help me if I could kiss you.

ALYSSA

No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just

friends.

SAM

What you think, you know, doesn't have

much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope

I'm not the first to say that about you.

ALYSSA

Okay, but then we'll just be friends.

Okay?

SAM

Okay.  I guess.

ALYSSA

Have you ever even kissed a girl?

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

Oh, yuck!

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

You're scrubbing the shower down.

ALYSSA

You must have a really great husband.

ROBIN

Why is that?

ALYSSA

Just, I mean, well, you're here every

single day.

ROBIN

He's at work while I'm here.

ALYSSA

I guess I'd just be jealous if I were

him.

ROBIN

Well, he doesn't need to worry.

ALYSSA

If my kids and my wife were always at an

ex-husband's house, I'd worry.

ROBIN

He's not the type to worry.

ROBIN (CONT'D)

Let's eat!

LOIS

I'd be glad to fix you something.

PETER

No, I'm fine.

ROBIN

Nothing R, okay?

RYAN

Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!

ADAM

And video games after!

ROBIN

Home after.

(to Sam)

Will you come in and say "hi"?

ADAM

Do we have to take her?

SAM

Definitely.

ROBIN

I should go.

GEORGE

Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.

ROBIN

No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.

GEORGE

It's just that there's less that Adam and

Ryan can do anymore.

(beat)

I'd hate to have them bored.

ROBIN

I know they're not much help, but they

love coming here, George.

GEORGE

How much time do they get to spend with

their dad?

ROBIN

What is it with this?  They wouldn't

spend less time with Peter if they lived

here!  He has no time!

ROBIN (CONT'D)

Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up

with us?  She's giving me crap about

being away from Peter and now you're

trying to do the same thing!  What no one

seems to realize is that Peter isn't

there!  He's not there!  And when he is,

he isn't!

(beat)

So, if you don't want me here, or you

don't want my kids here, just tell me,

George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't

be because of Peter.  It'll be because

you asked me to stop.  Say what you need

to say, because I'm not leaving until I

hear it.

GEORGE

I'd rather you not be here.

ROBIN

I thought we were helping.

GEORGE

I can hire workers to help me.

COLLEEN

You can come in and wait if you'd like.

JOSH

What friends did she go with?

ROBIN

Nothing is going on with us, is it?

GEORGE

Going on?

ROBIN

When I picked you up from the train

station...what you said.

GEORGE

What did I say?

ROBIN

That thing about I was the most, you

know, beautiful person you had ever

known.  What was that?

GEORGE

That was the truth.

ROBIN

You've never said that before.

GEORGE

I'll say a lot of things I've never said

before.  It's habit.

ROBIN

It sounded like a pick-up line.

GEORGE

I can't pick you up.

ROBIN

I'm married.

GEORGE

You bit my finger.

ROBIN

If I weren't married?

GEORGE

Let's not do this, okay?

ROBIN

I need to know.

GEORGE

You need to know what?  Do I still love

you?

GEORGE (CONT'D)

Absolutely.  There's not a doubt in my

mind that through all my anger...my ego,

I was faithful in my love for you.  From

seventh grade on.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

That I made you doubt it, that I withheld

it...that's the greatest mistake of a

life full of mistakes.

(beat)

But the truth doesn't set us free, Robin.

I can say it as many times as you can

stand to hear it.  And all that does, the

only thing, is remind us that love isn't

enough.  Not even close.

ROBIN

I should go.

PETER (O.S.)

All I am is what I have.

PETER (CONT'D)

That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?

ROBIN

What are you doing home?

PETER

I always felt I could never marry you

without first showing you what a fabulous

life you cloud live despite me.

ROBIN

You never really trusted me.

PETER

You live a fabulous life, Robin.

ROBIN

Despite you.

PETER

I never asked for more.

ROBIN

That's the problem.

PETER

Please don't leave me.

PETER (CONT'D)

Where are the kids?

ROBIN

Sam took them to a movie.

PETER

I'll be in the bedroom.

WOMAN (O.S.)

Oh God!

GEORGE

I fell asleep!

ALYSSA

Sam's dropping Adam and Ryan off.

GEORGE

Can you keep Sam straight?

ALYSSA

He's not gay.  I found out purely by

accident, believe me.

GEORGE

I mean drugs.

(catching up)

I thought you said he was?

ALYSSA

He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like

any of it.

GEORGE

You're a good girl.

ALYSSA

I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.

GEORGE

You have to ask like that?

ALYSSA

I want you to try something with me,

okay?

GEORGE

I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral

morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till

I can say no and sound convincing?

ALYSSA

Did you feel anything?

GEORGE

Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my

mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?

ALYSSA

When you dated my mom, I saw you kiss her

once.  You looked like such a good

kisser.

ALYSSA (V.O.)

My mother would die.

GEORGE (V.O.)

Let's shut up and not kill her.

COLLEEN

Oh my God!

ALYSSA

It's not what I was expecting.

GEORGE

What did you think it would be?

ALYSSA

I don't know...

(realizing)

More like when I kissed Sam.

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

More like that.

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

Thanks for your time.

COLLEEN

Oh my God!  Get dressed!  Get dressed!

ALYSSA

Mom!?

ALYSSA

Hello?

ALYSSA

Mom?

COLLEEN (O.S.)

Here, honey!

ALYSSA

I completely forgot.  I'm so sorry, Josh.

(beat)

What are you doing?

COLLEEN

I put him to work.

ALYSSA

What's wrong?

COLLEEN

I couldn't get it to go down.

ALYSSA

And why was the alarm on?

COLLEEN

Oh...I set it to see if it would work.

ALYSSA

You'd better call and cancel.

COLLEEN

Oh God, we don't want the police!

ALYSSA

What's going on?

JOSH

What's the deal with you and Sam?

ADAM

I got to play one video game for three

hours straight!

RYAN

Wouldn't you move to another one if the

one you were playing made you look

stupid?

ADAM

That's how you get things right is to

always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?

ROBIN

I guess it depends on what you give up

on.

SAM

There were no PG's.  So I just gave them

money to play games.

ROBIN

Can you stay for dinner?

SAM

Depends on what I'd give up on.

SAM (CONT'D)

It looks like a trap.

ROBIN

Go tell your father we're eating.

RYAN

Dad's home, already?

ROBIN

In the bedroom.

ADAM

He's not there.

ROBIN

He's here.  Check the bathroom.

ADAM

I checked everywhere.  He's not there.

ALYSSA

What are you doing up so early?

COLLEEN

I couldn't sleep last night.

ALYSSA

I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm

not.

COLLEEN

Why?  What do you mean?

ALYSSA

Uh...using Josh like that.

COLLEEN

I will never forgive myself.  Never,

Alyssa.  I know I took advantage.  It's

inexcusable.  Oh, God.  I should have my

head examined.

ALYSSA

He said you asked him to tighten your

toilet seat, too.  That's so uncool.

COLLEEN

I won't do it again.  I swear.

DAVID

Mind your own fucking business!

ADAM

Dad's disappeared!

RYAN

He was there and then he wasn't!

SAM

He hasn't called?

ADAM

Who are you?

DALE

I'm the electrician.

ADAM

I'm the builder!

ROBIN

Is your back still killing you?

GEORGE

I didn't think you'd come today.

ROBIN

I kept thinking about it, what you

said... I hope you were trying to keep me

away fro the sake of me.

GEORGE

No.  Mostly me.

ROBIN

Peter left me yesterday.

GEORGE

Left you?

ROBIN

No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in

love with George?'

GEORGE

What did he say?

ROBIN

'I'll be in the bedroom.'

ROBIN (CONT'D)

I couldn't walk in there.

(beat)

So he left.

SAM (O.S.)

Dad, Dale needs to know..

GEORGE

I had a kink in my...

ROBIN

Back.  Neck.  Back.

GEORGE

What?

SAM

The door was open.

ROBIN

(a quick confession)

I don't know what I'm doing.

SAM

I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing

it.

GEORGE

It won't happen again.

SAM

Dale wants to know if we should run an

outside outlet for Christmas lights with

a switch inside?

GEORGE

Absolutely.

(beat)

Have him put it on a separate line.  At

Christmas, we'll pact it so full of

lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.

ROBIN

I could die.

GEORGE

So could I.

ROBIN

Are you going to kiss me?

GEORGE

It's not my back that's killing me.

JOSH

I don't see her.

(beat)

Please just open the door when I knock.

ALYSSA (O.S.)

Josh?

JOSH

I was hoping...you could..you know.  Go

for a ride?

SAM

On the handlebars or your shoulders?

ALYSSA

Are you afraid of heights?

JOSH

Not really.

ALYSSA

Can you help us out?

JOSH

My parents cut my allowance off.  Without

a car, I'm totally screwed.

ALYSSA

George is paying Sam ten dollars an hour.

SAM

Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for

two hours.

ALYSSA

What?

SAM

It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.

JOSH

I could use the money.

ALYSSA

Hey, George!  I recruited some help for

the roof!

GEORGE

George Nelson.

JOSH

Josh.

ALYSSA

Me too!

RYAN

I just wanted to know where Mom was?

GEORGE

Oh.  Sorry.

RYAN

It's okay.

GEORGE

She needs to be alone, I think.

RYAN

Because Dad left?

GEORGE

She's a little sad, is all.

RYAN

I don't even care if he ever comes back.

GEORGE

Josh, you look like you could use a hug.

JOSH

No...I'm okay.  I'm okay.

DALE

Don't even think about it.

GEORGE

Well, they got me started.

DALE

I swear to God, I'll use these wires and

shock you so bad your tongue will turn

black.

DALE

Would you get it for me?

JOSH (O.S.)

Just let mine ring!

GEORGE

I guess... I don't know.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

(into phone)

Hello?

COLLEEN

(into phone)

Where are you?  You're driving me crazy,

waiting like this.  I want you in me now!

GEORGE

(into phone)

Colleen?!

COLLEEN

(into phone)

I..I..I.. George?!

JOSH (O.S.)

Is it mine?!

GEORGE

God, I hope not.

DALE (O.S.)

That's not mine.

JOSH (O.S.)

Oh, shit!

JOSH

I'm okay.  I'm fine.  Maybe I'll go home.

ADAM

Is that bone sticking out?

ROBIN

Don't move!

GEORGE

I'm an idiot to have you up there.

JOSH

No.  It's my fault.

COLLEEN

I heard a scream!

JOSH

If I could just stand up.

ALYSSA

Josh fell.

GEORGE

I think he might have broken a leg.

GEORGE

Two ribs, a finger, a leg, a bruised

kidney and a mild concussion aren't bad

considering he landed on brick.

ROBIN

I better get the kids home.

GEORGE

Not a perfect day.

SAM

You look like shit, lately.

GEORGE

You look better than ever.

SAM

I don't think Mom cares that much that

my...that Peter left.

GEORGE

She seemed upset.

SAM

What's wrong with your back?

SAM (CONT'D)

I mean, do you need to have surgery on it

or what?  Because those pills you're

taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're

going through them quick.

GEORGE

Are you taking them still?

SAM

No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't

new, you know?

GEORGE

I'm having a problem with cancer.

SAM

I don't know what that means.  What kind

of problem?

GEORGE

The kind where there isn't really an

answer.

SAM

I still don't know what that means.

GEORGE

I wanted you here so we could have a few

months together.  Maybe everything

happens for a reason.  Something bad to

force something good.

SAM

What?  Are you dying?

GEORGE

I'm having a problem with cancer.

SAM

I don't know what that means.  What kind

of problem?

GEORGE

The kind where there isn't really an

answer.

SAM

I still don't know what that means.

GEORGE

I wanted you here so we could have a few

months together.  Maybe everything

happens for a reason.  Something bad to

force something good.

SAM

What?  Are you dying?

SAM (CONT'D)

And you told Mom today?

GEORGE

Yes.

SAM

Fuck you!  You knew you were dying from

the start!

GEORGE

We're all dying from the start.

(beat)

I just got picked for Advanced Placement.

SAM

You lied to me!

GEORGE

I would have lied to me if I thought I'd

believe it.

SAM

This was all for your sake, wasn't it?

Having me here?  Trying to get me to like

you.

GEORGE

I never tried to get you to like me.

(beat)

I tried to get you to love me.

SAM

Well, congratulations!  You fucking

pulled it off!

SAM

Is Alyssa here?

COLLEEN

It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?

SAM

Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need

to talk to Alyssa.

ALYSSA (O.S.)

Sam?

GEORGE

It's open.

KURT

It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with

the plumbing.

GEORGE

I need you to do me a favor.

KURT

(concerned)

God, you look like crap, George.

GEORGE

I want you to find someone for me.

COLLEEN

Does your son still own a company that

builds houses?

COLLEEN

He's been asleep for hours.

ROBIN

Is Sam okay?

ALYSSA

He won't leave my room.

ROBIN

Will he talk to me?

ALYSSA

No.

BOB

You're not a plumber, Kurt.

KURT

I worked every summer with my dad.  Check

out what I've done.

BOB

It's not whether it's good or bad.  You

know that.  It's whether your licensed.

KURT

Are you still renting that illegal non

conforming studio under your house for a

thousand a month?

BOB

Okay.  Looks good to me.

KURT

Oh, that's embarrassing.  That was too

easy.  At least look around.  I really

did do it right.

BOB

That isn't why I'm here, anyway.

GEORGE

I've been dreading you.

BOB

Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is

adamant your home has exceeded its

approved height.  He's filed to have

construction stopped immediately.

GEORGE

It's thirty feet.

BOB

Well, if it is, we have a problem.

GEORGE

I have the permit.

BOB

After your last extension request and

with Design Review and the Board of

Adjustment and the appeals to the city

council, was there an amended permit?

GEORGE

To the patio and one north-facing

window...

(suddenly realizing)

And six inches to the height.

GEORGE (CONT'D)

David Dokos?

KURT

Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn,

day after day?

GEORGE

I don't let him.  He just loves to.

COLLEEN

He'll make you tear the entire roof off

rather than give you any satisfaction.

BOB

I'm afraid you won't be able to continue

until this is settled.  You can always go

back and file an appeal.

GEORGE

That would take weeks.

BOB

Months.

ROBIN

Just so you know, we'll be here working

tomorrow and every day after until this

house is finished.

BOB

He'll call us again and then he'll call

the police.  He has an attorney on

retainer.

ROBIN

Just so you know.

BOB

If he hears a hammer, he'll have you

arrested.

ALYSSA

I'm going to bed.

COLLEEN

Has he eaten anything at all?

COLLEEN (CONT'D)

I'd be more comfortable if he slept in

the guestroom.

ALYSSA

I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't

slept with Josh.  And George would be

more comfortable if he weren't dying.

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

Comfort doesn't mean that much when just

getting through the night is the goal,

Mom.

GEORGE

Please...I can't.

ALYSSA

There are like twenty people working on

your dad's house!

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

If it were my father, I'd wanna spend

every second with him I had left.

SAM

You hate your father.

ALYSSA

If he tricked me into loving him, is what

I meant.

SAM

You'd hate him for the trick.

ALYSSA

Not if what he left me was real.

TOM

He pulled this crew off a tract in

Newport.  They're the best.

ROBIN

What's going on?

COLLEEN

I hired some help.

ROBIN

Why?

ALYSSA (O.S.)

Mom?!

COLLEEN

Atonement.

ALYSSA

Who are all these people?

ROBIN

Where's George?

COLLEEN

I think he's still sleeping.

ROBIN

George!?

ROBIN (CONT'D)

Wake up...You're still warm.

GEORGE

Stop licking me.

ALYSSA

Your dad's going to the hospital!

ALYSSA (CONT'D)

Come on!

SAM

I don't wanna go.

ALYSSA

He asked where you were!  He wants you

with him.

SAM

I don't wanna go.

DAVID

Nothing is built until the Board of

Adjustment hears the appeal!

DAVID (CONT'D)

Where is he?

TOM

I should have reported you for tossing

that piece of dog doo.

BARBARA

Tom, let's not overreact now.

DAVID

I want this fucking piece of shit

construction stopped now and I want that

goddamn roof ripped off and lowered and I

don't care if I have to spend a shit load

of money to get it done!!  I will do

it!!!

TOM

I want this house finished before he can

stop it.

ALYSSA

Sam?

RYAN

Guster, be quiet.

PETER

Hey.

RYAN

Hey.

PETER

You got a dog?

RYAN

It's not ours.  It's George's.

PETER

I've missed you guys.

RYAN

Why?

RYAN (CONT'D)

I'll tell Mom you're here.

PETER

I thought maybe... I know it's late...but

if you're hungry...

COLLEEN

Are you doing okay?

ADAM

And we got to take all the old paint off

all the doors and then George taught us

how to stain everything and he even let

me choose the color I liked best!  And he

said he loved me!

RYAN

We did a lot of the wiring too.

ADAM

With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole

into a board to put the wire through!

PETER

I've never heard you so excited about

anything.

ADAM

Maybe you can come help us too?!

PETER

I'd like that.

NUR

I'm afraid no one's allowed in here now.

SAM

He's my dad.

SAM (CONT'D)

I brought you something.

GEORGE

(weakly)

I don't wanna go, Sam.

SAM

Here.

SAM (CONT'D)

Can you see?

SAM (CONT'D)

It's almost done.

ROBIN

Go brush your teeth and get right into

bed.  It's late.

ADAM

Goodnight.

PETER

Goodnight.

RYAN

Do you know anything about building a

house?

PETER

No.

RYAN

I guess I could teach you some things.

PETER

Okay.

ROBIN

I hardly recognize you with a beard.

PETER

That was my plan...to be hardly

recognizable to you as me.

ROBIN

I feel in love with George again.

PETER

I'll see you tomorrow.

ALYSSA

Where are you?!

SAM

Floating to Catalina.

ALYSSA

What?

KURT

He said he heard hammering.

SAM

Who?

DAVID

My attorney is driving down from Newport

Beach.  If I hear one more nail being

hammered, I swear to God before this is

all over I'll end up owing this house!

KURT

Mr. Dokos says that your father missed

his height envelope by six inches.

ALYSSA

He wants the entire roof taken off and

lowered.

SAM

Wait a minute.

SAM (CONT'D)

Do you drive a black Mercedes?

DAVID

No.

DAVID (CONT'D)

I'm going back to my house to wait for my

lawyer.

SAM

Are you sure we need lawyers?

SAM (CONT'D)

Because all we're really talking about is

six inches, right?

DAVID

Are you threatening me?

KURT

What are you talking about?

SAM

I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage.

How could I possibly threaten you?

SAM (CONT'D)

Would you like to help us finish the

house, Mr. Dokos?

DAVID

Yes, I would.

KURT

What the fuck?

SAM

Everything happens for a reason.  That's

what my dad said.

KURT

Then you tell me, what just happened?

SAM

The payoff.

DAVID

I'll just...change clothes.

ROBIN

I found the last time you were happy.

ADAM

It's almost done!

SAM

Do you guys feel like painting?

ADAM

What color?

SAM

Red.

ADAM

I love red!  That's my favorite color!

PETER

You don't look like you.

SAM

Either do you.

PETER

I thought I might be able to help, but it

looks like you have all you can handle.

SAM

Do you like red?

NURSE

Are you sure we can't call anyone?

ADAM

Mom!

ADAM

When does George get to come see his

house?

ROBIN

It's so beautiful.

RYAN

Is George okay?

GEORGE (V.O.)

I always thought of myself as a house.  I

was always what I lived in.  It didn't

need to be big.  It didn't even need to

be beautiful.  I just needed to be mine.

I became what I was meant to be.  I built

myself a life.  I built myself a house.

ROBIN

You're sure about this?

SAM

Yeah.

ROBIN

You could keep it and rent it out?

SAM

This is what he wants.

ROBIN

I read the letter.  You read the will.

He wants you to keep it.  To live in it

some day.

SAM

Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but

this what he was hoping for.

(beat)

Maybe it's what I want.

GEORGE (V.O.)

Twenty-one years ago, my father crossed a

double-line.  He changed my life and the

life of a little girl forever with that

mistake.  I just can't stop thinking

about her.

WOMAN

Hello.

SAM

My father built you a house...

THE END.
