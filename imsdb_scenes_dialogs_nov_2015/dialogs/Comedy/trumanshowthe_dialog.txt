THE TRUMAN SHOW

A Screen Play

By

Andrew M. Niccol

"One doesn't discover new lands

without consenting to lose sight

of the shore for a very long time."

Andre Gide

"We're all in this alone."

Lily Tomlin

TRUMAN

Shit!

FATHER

(out of breath, clutching his side)

Truman!  Truman!

Stop!

FATHER

Come down

now!

FATHER

(reading Truman's mind, enraged)

No!

TRUMAN

(sensing his father is keeping

something from him)

Why?  What's there?

FATHER

(unconvincing)

Nothing's there.  It's the same as this.

(trace of desperation)

Come down,

please!

FATHER

I told you to stay close.  Don't ever leave

my sight again.  You gotta know your

limitations.  You could've been washed

away by the tide.

TRUMAN

(quickly recovering)

Gimme a copy of "The Sydney Morning Herald".

VENDOR

We ran out.

TRUMAN

(hastily departing)

Thanks anyway.

DOUGLAS

I wanna be a chiropractor like my dad.

SISTER

(impressed)

Tell the class what a chiropractor does,

Douglas.

DOUGLAS

He helps people by fixing their backs,

Sister Olivia.

SISTER

That's right, Douglas.

(holding her back, hamming it up)

Perhaps I'll be your first patient.

SISTER

What about you, Truman?

TRUMAN

I want to be an explorer

(with reverence)

...like

Magellan.

SISTER

No one's going to pay you to do that,

Truman.

(with scarcely disguised glee)

Besides, you're too late.  There's

nothing left to explore.

TRUMAN

(into receiver)

...okay, okay, let's call it what it is...

I'm not gonna lie to you...life insurance

is

death

insurance...you just gotta ask

yourself two questions...

one,

in the event

of your death, will anyone experience

financial loss?...and

two,

do you care?

TRUMAN

(into receiver)

Hold on will ya?

(to Clerk, putting receiver

to chest, referring to the book)

This's no good.  Lumps all drownings

together.  I need drownings broken down

by category.

TRUMAN

(returning to his call)

...just think about what I've been

saying and lemme...hello?...

TRUMAN

(lowering his voice)

Can you connect me with directory

inquiries in Sydney, Australia?

(a long delay makes Truman

even more uncomfortable)

...er, yes.  Do you have a listing

for a Lauren Powers...

(pause)

...nothing listed?...what about a

Sylvia

Powers...nothing?  Thanks...

TYRONE

(nauseatngly cheerful)

How's it goin', Truman?

TRUMAN

(deadpan)

Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.

TYRONE

(not listening to Truman's

reply, as Truman anticipated)

Good.  Good.

TRUMAN

Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?

TYRONE

(not missing a beat)

I'd ask for identification.

FEMALE CASHIER

(a whisper to prevent Truman overhearing)

He's right

there.

You're supposed to pay

when he's

here.

MALE CUSTOMER

(nonchalant shrug as he departs)

He never notices.

TYRONE

Hold on, Truman.  I got somethin' to show ya.

TYRONE

(referring to the photo)

The flagship of Christoforo...our Genoese

navigator, huh?  I know you love this like me.

TRUMAN

(averting his eyes with difficulty)

Not me.  You got the wrong man.

TYRONE

See ya tomorrow, Truman.

CHRISTOF

(never taking his eyes

from the monitor)

You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the

road?  They're pulling out a body.  You know

you shouldn't look, but you do.

MAN

Hello?...I'm sorry, I got more than enough

insurance.

TRUMAN

(into receiver)

...this isn't about insurance, this is

about the great variable - when will

death occur?  Could be a week, a month,

a year.  Could happen today...A sunbather,

minding his own business, gets stabbed in

the heart by the tip of a runaway beach

umbrella...No way you can guard against

that kinda thing, no way at all...

LAWRENCE

(handing Truman some documentation)

Hey, Burbank, I got a bridge-buyer in

Stapleton I need you to cloes by four.

TRUMAN

Stapleton on Staten Island?

LAWRENCE

(sarcastic)

You know another one?

TRUMAN

I can't do it.

LAWRENCE

(insistent)

A half hour across the bay.  Sea air.  Do

you good.

TRUMAN

No, I...

(searching for a plausible excuse)

...I got an appointment uptown.

LAWRENCE

This is a sure thing.

(conspiratorial)

They're upping our quota.  You need this.

TRUMAN

(shouting above the wind)

Let's go further, daddy!  Let's go further!

FATHER

(shouting back)

It's getting late, Truman.

TRUMAN

(entreating his father)

Please!

...

COMMUTER 1

(commenting out of Truman's earshot)

I can't believe he's taking the long way.

COMMUTER 2

He'll never make it.

TRUMAN

I'm here to see a Mr Hamilton.

CONCIERGE

You from the insurance company?  You missed him.

TRUMAN

When will he be back?

CONCIERGE

Vacation.  Two months.  He waited as long as

he could.  You was supposed to be here by four.

YOUTH 1

(to woman)

You wanna read to me?

YOUTH 1

(more insistent)

You wannna read to me?

YOUTH 2

(menacing)

My friend asked you a question.

WOMAN

(reaching for the book)

Please...

YOUTH 2

Now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends.

YOUTH 1

We're gonna tell you how it ends, baby.

YOUTH 2

Don't you wanna know how it ends?

WOMAN

(screams)

Help!!  Please, help!!

WOMAN

Thanks.

WOMAN

(pondering the incident)

He did nothing.

YOUTH 1

(shrugs, suddenly more couth)

Physical violence paralyzes him.  Always

has.

MERYL

(proudly referring to the knife-set)

I got it free with the tune-up.

MERYL

You missed a section.

TRUMAN

(referring to her hands)

Do they hurt?

MERYL

I was afraid I'd seize up during cross.

One of the keys kept sticking.

TRUMAN

(referring to the article)

Is he gonna take the stand?

MERYL

(dispassionate, matter-of-fact)

No point.  Two eye witnesses saw him

near the dumpster where they found the legs.

MERYL

You gonna eat before you leave?

TRUMAN

I'll get something out.

MERYL

(sensing something odd

in his demeanor)

Did something happen today?

TRUMAN

(composing himself)

What could happen?

MARLON

Ouch.  Whose nuts were those?

TRUMAN

(opening a beer from the six pack)

Mine.

TRUMAN

I gotta get out, Marlon.

MARLON

(mild interest only)

Yeah?  Outta what?

TRUMAN

Outta my job, outta Queens...

out!

MARLON

Outta your

job?

What the hell's wrong

with your

job?

You gotta great job.

You gotta

desk

job.  I'd kill for a desk

job.

MARLON

(annoyed by the errant tee shot)

Sonofabitch.

TRUMAN

It doesn't mean anything.

MARLON

(still looking in the

direction of his ball)

Nothing

means anything.  Try stocking vending

machines for a living.  My biggest decision

of the day is whether the Almond Joys look

better next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths.

TRUMAN

(adamant)

I gotta get out.

MARLON

(skeptical, picking up his beer)

Sure and go where?

TRUMAN

(unable to disguise his reverence)

Australia.

MARLON

(impressed)

No shit.  Where is Australia exactly?

Near England?

TRUMAN

See here, this is Queens.

(sliding his finger around

the other side of the ball)

All the way round here, Australia.  You

can't get any further away before you start

coming back.

(tossing the world in his hand,

warming to his subject)

Y'know, there're still places in Australia

where no human being has ever set foot.

MARLON

(still dubious)

So when are you leaving?

TRUMAN

It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.

You can't just up and go.

(heading off Marlon's skepticism)

Oh, I'm gonna do it, don't worry about

that.  I just gotta move slow.  Pick a

moment.  Bonus time's just around the

corner.  Soon as I get a retaining wall

built on the back of the house I can

start thinking about selling up...and I'll be

gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.

(as if to convince himself)

I'm going, don't you worry about that.

MARLON

I never knew anybody who got out.

TRUMAN

(slightly the worse for drink)

Tick-fucking-tock.  That's the fucking

problem, Marlon.  I'm thirty-four.  I'm

older than Jesus Christ.

TRUMAN

Where do the dreams go, Marlon?

MARLON

(picking up the last ball marked with an

initial "T", trying to ignore the question)

You win.

TRUMAN

I'm

serious.

Where do the dreams

go?

MARLON

(humoring his maudlin friend)

They're still there.  Just buried under what

we settled for.

TRUMAN

(referring to the light)

You really think it could've dropped off an

airliner?

MARLON

(unimpressed)

Sure.  It's halogen.  You oughta report it.

(quickly changing the subject)

You coming for a drink?

TRUMAN

I can't tonight.

TRUMAN

(shouting at the surf)

I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!

MERYL

(suggestive)

What are you doing?  Come to bed.

TRUMAN

(ignoring the suggestion)

I figure we could scrape together eight

thousand.

MERYL

(suddenly exasperated)

Oh.  God, everytime you and Marlon--

TRUMAN

--We could bum around the world for a year

on that.

MERYL

And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to

where we were five years ago.  You're talking

like a teenager.

TRUMAN

Maybe I

feel

like a teenager.

TRUMAN

Meryl, it'd be an adventure.

MERYL

We said we'd try for a baby.  Isn't that

enough of an adventure?

TRUMAN

That can wait.  I want to get away.  See

some of the world.  Explore.

MERYL

You want to be an explorer?  You mean like

all the other great explorers from Queens?

You don't even have a passport, Truman.  I

bet you don't even know how to get one.

MERYL

This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this

now and then.

(making one more attempt

at seduction)

Come to bed.

GUARD 1

How can they have a child?

GUARD 2

It's not gonna be his, you idiot.

GUARD 1

Why not?

GUARD 2

You think she'd go through with it?

(reassessing his own opinion)

Guess I always thought they'd adopt.

TRUMAN

(plaintively calling into the mist)

Daddy!!...Daddy!!...

OLD WOMAN 1

(playing amateur psychiatrist)

It left him with more than his obvious fear

of the water.  It's as if he felt his father

had gone beyond his limitations and he vowed

never to repeat the mistake.  He was never

the same curious little boy again.

OLD WOMAN 2

We're all born with a pound of cocaine

up our nose.  By the time we're eleven

it runs out.

OLD WOMAN 1

Half the people I knew named their

babies after him.

TRUMAN

(almost to himself, mouthing

the word)

Daddy...

TRUMAN

(to BUS DRIVER)

Hey, stop!  Stop!!

ATTENDANT

(running after the car)

Hey!

TRUMAN

(reading aloud, the

ID number of the bus)

Two, four, oh, six.

TRUMAN

(shouting at the cars)

Outta the way!  Outta the way!

ATTENDANT

What the fuck are you trying to pull?!

TRUMAN

(cowering, the fight instantly

gone out of him)

I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!  No harm done!

No harm done!

ATTENDANT

(feverishly inspecting the

fenders for dents, he finds none)

I oughta fuck you up!

ATTENDANT

Get the fuck outta here.

MARLON

What're you doing?

(gesturing to the office)

The man told you there's no such bus.

TRUMAN

He's lying.  Two, four, oh, six was

definitely the number.

TRUMAN

I never believed he was dead.

MARLON

(trying to be patient)

C'mon, Truman, a lotta times they don't find

a body.  You know what the currents are like

in that water.

TRUMAN

(shudders, a memory

flashing in his head)

You had to see his face when that wave hit.

He wasn't scared Marion.  It was like he

was expecting it, waiting for it.  He

knew it was coming.

MARLON

Why would he fake it?

(trying to make light)

He's not Elvis Presley.

TRUMAN

(ignoring the joke, pondering

the morning's events)

You know what was really strange about today?

An old woman with a little dog and a

businessman, walking in opposite directions

on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork.

They force him onto a bus against his will,

a bus that doesn't normally stop outside

my building.  And when I'm giving chase, the

bus never makes another stop and I get the

feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians

are working together to make sure I never

catch up with it.

MARLON

(sarcastic)

Oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and

the buses and the cars?  What are you

saying, the entire population of Lower

Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding

out that your father staged his death to

pursue a life as a street person?  Oh yeah,

that makes sense.

TRUMAN

You think I imagined it, don't you?

MARLON

I think you're missing your dad.

(trying to be delicate)

The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it?

MARLON

You got sand in your cuffs.

TRUMAN

Maybe you're right.  If only the old

woman hadn't left her dog behind.

RAQUEL

Don't you dare go in. Truman.  I just

got her off to sleep.

TRUMAN

It was Dad. I swear.

RAQUEL

Well, the next time he shows up. bring

him over.  Until then, I'm not saying a

word about this to Mom and neither are you.

TRUMAN

If it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Can you

think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?

RACQUEL

I know a reason he'd want to hide from

you.

Look at how you treat us.  You live ten minutes

away, we hardly see you from year to year and

then you turn up with this story so insane you

don't even believe it yourself.  Haven't you

hurt her enough, Truman?  She already blames you.

TRUMAN

(incredulous)

I was seven years old!

RAQUEL

But you're here and he's not.  Has it really taken you

this long to invent a story to ease your conscience?

TRUMAN

I'm telling you he's alive!

RAQUEL

(snapping back bitterly)

And I'm telling you he's fish food!

CHRISTOF

You did well.

CHLOE

We've tightened security.

CHLOE

(referring to Kirk)

Why would he do this to us?

CHRISTOF

Old age.  Sentiment.  You play someone's

father all those years, you

are

someone's

father...He sees the way Truman is.  He

feels responsible.

YOUNG CHRISTOF

(barking instructions to Kirk)

...as soon as we give the cue, tack to windward...

YOUNG CHRISTOF

The freak wave will strike from the

starboard side.  Remember, you don't

go to the diver.  The diver goes to you.

YOUNG CHRISTOF

...Good!  Good!...of course, on the day you

only surface once you're safely beyond the

cove...Try it one more time...You okay?

MERYL

What're you doing out here?

TRUMAN

(turning attention to an upturned

mower on the garage floor)

Fixing the mower.

MERYL

(concerned)

Your sister called.  She was worried about you.

TRUMAN

(matter-of-fact)

I saw my father on State Street dressed as

a homeless man.

MERYL

(attempting to comfort)

I kept seeing my brother for years after he died.

TRUMAN

(irritated at her subtle dismissiveness)

What do you want?

MERYL

I made macaroni.

TRUMAN

I gotta go out.  About a replacement...

(hastily adding)

...mower blade.

FEMALE VOICE (from radio)

...west on Atlantic...he's making a right

on Woodhaven...

MALE VOICE (from radio)

...God, Truman almost hit Marilyn!...he's

on the move again, passing the Burger King...

MALE VOICE

(from radio, in distress himself)

...something's wrong.  Change frequencies...

VERONICA

Hey, Truman!  Where you bin?  You bin

cheatin' on me?

VERONICA

Bout time you got this thing cleaned.

(half-joking)

Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady

wear it.

VERONICA

(examining the bottle)

God, do they still make this stuff?

What's the Sell-By Date?

CHLOE

(into a flip-phone,

condescending)

...you see him messing with the antenna...what

did you

think

would happen?...

"lapse of

concentration",

is that what you call it?

I call it amateur-hour...

(sarcastic)

In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to

do it over.

CHLOE

(as she hangs up, querying the

smile that plays around his lips)

You think this is funny?

CHRISTOF

The mask has slipped before.  Everything

can be explained.

CHRISTOF

(adopting a more serious tone

as he returns his attention to Truman)

What's dangerous is that he makes the connection

between what happened today and the

girl

.

VERONICA

Like I say, I don't normally do this.

I gotta charge extra.

CHRISTOF (V.O.)

He's re-created the event on and off for a

number of years.  We've never understood what

prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that

matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy

to approach her in the first place...

CHRISTOF (V.O.)

We'd noticed them making eyes at each other

for some weeks but never thought he'd say

anything.  She was a year older, wrote poetry,

way out of his league...

TRUMAN

(to Lauren, tongue-tied, a strangled greeting)

Hi.

GIRLFRIEND 1

(to Lauren as the two girlfriends

abruptly depart)

See you in class.

TRUMAN

Lauren, right?

LAUREN

No.

TRUMAN

(ignoring her lack of interest)

Look.  I was wonder--

LAUREN

--I can't go out with you.

TRUMAN

I haven't asked you yet.

LAUREN

Well when you do, that's my answer.

(softening)

I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.

TRUMAN

(summoning up courage from somewhere)

Why, you married?

TRUMAN

I'm not asking you to have my children,

just a pizza.  How about Saturday?

LAUREN

(adamant)

No.

TRUMAN

Friday?

LAUREN

Now.

TRUMAN

Right

now?  We got finals.

LAUREN

If we don't go now, it won't happen.

LAUREN

(impatient, looking anxiously around)

Well, what do you want to do?

CHRISTOF (V.O.)

We knew we were taking a risk.  She hadn't

been properly coached, but we were torn...

He'd summoned the courage to make the

approach...We wanted to reward that.  Of

course she took full advantage...

LAUREN

I never knew this place existed.

LAUREN

Come on!  Come on!  It's wonderful!

TRUMAN

(nervous)

I...I can't.

LAUREN

That's right.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.

TRUMAN

(confused)

Why? You've got nothing to be sorry about.

Has someone been talking to you?

LAUREN

(to the sky, upset)

Get me out of here.  I don't want to

be here.

TRUMAN

(confused, calling after her)

What are you talking about?  Lauren!  Lauren!

LAUREN

(distraught)

My name's not Lauren!  It's

Sylvia!

SYLVIA

In a minute someone's going to come and

stop me talking to you.

TRUMAN

(looking around the deserted park)

Who?  There's no one around.

SYLVIA

(covering his lips once again)

You remember when you were a little boy,

you stood up in class and said you wanted

to be an explorer like Magellan.  And your

teacher, Sister Olivia said, "You're too

late, Truman.  There's nothing left to

explore."  And all the other kids laughed.

And you sat down.

TRUMAN

(incredulous)

How do you know about that?

SYLVIA

It doesn't matter.  You've forgotten about

that boy, Truman.  You got scared.  Just

because something happens, doesn't mean you

can't take another chance in your life.

TRUMAN

I don't understand.

SYLVIA

(looking over her shoulder nervously)

There isn't much time.  Just listen.

Everybody's pretending Truman.  Everybody

but

you.

(pointing to the

buildings on the horizon)

Look at that project.  You think anybody

lives there?  It's all for you, Truman.

A show.  The eyes are everywhere.

TRUMAN

(protesting)

Eyes?  Where?

SYLVIA

(frustrated, raving)

Everywhere,

disguised...

Truman, they're

going to fill your head with lies.

You've got to make yourself deaf, you

understand?  When you're afraid the most, it

means you're on the right track.  Trust that

boy.  Promise me you'll do that?

SYLVIA

(scared)

I told you, Truman!

TRUMAN

(shocked)

Hey!

MAN

(to Sylvia)

Get in the car, Lauren!

TRUMAN

(to the Man)

Who are

you?!

MAN

I'm her father!

SYLVIA

No he's not!  He's just saying that!

Does he look anything like me?!

TRUMAN

Shut your mouth!

TRUMAN

Leave her alone!

MAN

(to Sylvia)

I told you not to come here anymore!

(to Truman, who is getting

to his feet)

Which one are you?

SYLVIA

(calling out from the car)

Don't listen to him, Truman.  Make yourself

deaf.  Come find me.

MAN

(to Truman, getting into the car)

Don't bother!  We're moving to Australia.

New York's done something to her head.

CHRISTOF (V.O.)

Why did he say Australia?  Why couldn't he

have said New Jersey?

VERONICA

You want me to do it again?  I think I

could do it better.

TRUMAN

(coming back to reality)

No...thank you.

TRUMAN

Veronica, what do you know for sure?

VERONICA

For sure?

(taking a long drag on her cigarette

as she gives the question due

consideration)

The nuns at my school, they used to say,

"The whole of life is faith."

VERONICA

(giving Truman an affectionate

peck on the cheek)

On the house.

CHRISTOF (V.O.)

We removed all physical trace of her

but we couldn't erase the memory...

CHRISTOF (V.O.)

When he decided to go after Sylvia, we

were forced to intervene once again...

TRUMAN

(excited)

I've got something to tell you, Sis.

RAQUEL

(adopting a low, serious tone)

I've got something to tell you too.

TRUMAN

(unable to contain his news)

I'm going to Australia.

RAQUEL

Mom's real sick.

WAITRESS

She was willing to lose him if it meant he

could find himself.

(registering the barman's blank look)

Never mind.

SECURITY GUARD 1

(to Truman)

Can I help?

TRUMAN

(sneaking a glance at the

building directory)

I have an appointment at, er...Diamond

Enterprises.

SECURITY GUARD 1

They went bust.

SECURITY GUARD 1

You gotta leave.

TRUMAN

(riveted by the equally-stunned

building occupants)

What're they doing?

SECURITY GUARD 2

You gotta leave.

TRUMAN

(not going quietly)

Just tell me what the hell's going on?

SECURITY GUARD 1

We're re-modelling.

TRUMAN

Like fuck!  What're they doing?

TRUMAN

You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated!

SECURITY GUARD 2

Investigate what?  You're trespassing!

OFFICIAL

You can't--

TRUMAN

(anticipating his response)

--I know.

TRUMAN

You ever been into the AMT Building?

LAWRENCE

(following Truman's gaze)

Not since they begun reconstruction.

(referring to the file

in Truman's hands)

What're you doing with that?

TRUMAN

(defensive)

I'm going to visit a site.

LAWRENCE

What for?

TRUMAN

Because I never do.

LAWRENCE

(placing a hand on Truman's arm)

That's why we got adjusters.

TRUMAN

(looking at Lawrence's hand

on his arm)

You got a problem with me going?

LAWRENCE

I got a problem with you not doing your job,

Burbank.  You already screwed up once this week.

TRUMAN

Let me worry about that.

LAWRENCE

680 West 89th.

MOVER 1

Hey, would it kill ya to wait?!

TRUMAN

(impatiently to driver)

Is there another way?  Can't you get around

this?

TRUMAN

(to the boy)

When was the fire?

BOY

(shrug)

Week ago.

TRUMAN

How come it's still smoking?

BOY

Started up again.

(dismissive)

Kids.

TRUMAN

(referring to his claims report)

Says here it burnt to the ground.

BOY

Wishful thinking maybe?

TRUMAN

Someone send you to tell me all this?

BOY

(unfazed)

You the one askin' questions.

truly

observing for the first time.

CHRISTOF

...Everybody stay focused...remember who

you are...

CHRISTOF

(staring at the monitor)

Damn!

TRUMAN

(to the jogger with

the familiar sneakers)

Small world.

JOGGER 1

(attempting to sidestep Truman)

Excuse me.

TRUMAN

You don't remember?  Two days ago I gave you

my meatball sandwich in the park.  You were

in a wheelchair.  Same sneakers.

TRUMAN

(commenting ironically on his

new-found mobility)

A miracle!

JOGGER 2

(coming to his companion's aid)

Get the hell outta here.

TRUMAN

Marlon. I've gotta talk to you.

MARLON

(surprised)

Truman!  Sorry, I'm up against it today.

TRUMAN

I've fallen over something, Marlon.

Something to do with my Dad. I think.

MARLON

(looking at him for the first time)

Are you okay? You look like shit.

TRUMAN

(ignoring the inquiries

about his health)

It's big, Marlon.  You wouldn't believe

who's in on it.

MARLON

(distracted)

In on

what?

TRUMAN

There's no point trying to show you, they cover

their tracks too well.  But I've been going

into a lotta strange buildings, seeing a lotta

familiar faces, y'know what I mean?

MARLON

(still engrossed in his own problems)

Something's definitely in the air.  My last

delivery, a kid got crushed to death.

tilting a vending machine.  They won't even

let me take the rest of the day off.

TRUMAN

Do it, anyway.

TRUMAN

I'm deadly serious. Marlon.  We can't talk

here.  I'm being followed.

MARLON

(suddenly concerned)

Who?

TRUMAN

I don't know.  They look just like regular

people.

(producing a notebook from

his jacket pocket)

But I've been writing down numbers - license

plates, taxi numbers, ID numbers - the same

ones keep cropping up over and over.

MARLON

Is someone leanin' on you, Tru?  Cos I got

some friends here, they owe me.  We can lean back.

(pointing out a taxi

parked outside the yard)

Is he one of them?

TRUMAN

(anxious)

I don't know.  Could be.  One thing's certain.

The key is spontoneity.  Be unpredictable.

They can't stand that.  That's why we've got

to get outta here.  Can you come with me?

MARLON

(weakening)

Christ, Truman.  You're gonna get both our

asses fired.

MARLON

Where're we going?

TRUMAN

The beach.

CHRISTOF

(marveling, excitedly referring

to Truman on the monitor)

I can't believe how much he's shoved down.  That he

sensed the significance at aged seven and clung

to it so fiercely.

CHRISTOF

(gesturing to the clifftop on the

monitor pointedly excluding Roman

from the conversation)

You remember, Moses, it used to end right

there, before the expansion.

ROMAN

(unable to contain his anxiety

any longer)

Christof, the cracks are starting to show.

CHRISTOF

(reassuring, keeping

himself in check)

I'll paper over them.

CHLOE

(coming to the defense of her mentor)

Truman's had bouts of paranoia before and

recovered.

ROMAN

(adamant, faintly hysterical)

No, not like this.  It's compromised.

Becoming

unwatchable.

CHRISTOF

Fear?  Doubt?

Is that what you have

trouble watching?  Perhaps you don't like

watching

yourself.

MOSES

(realizing his colleague is in

over his head, including Chloe

to save Roman's face)

Why don't you two wait outside?

CHRISTOF

(instantly more comfortable in the

company of a man his own age)

He's jumped the rails, Moses, that's all.  We'll

get him back on.

MOSES

You know why they're so nervous.  The birth of

Truman's child is going to double revenue.

For God's sake don't let him upstage you.

(indicating Simeon through

the glass walls)

You've been grooming a successor.

CHRISTOF

He's not ready.

MOSES

Him

or

you?

CHRISTOF

(jaw setting firm, referring

to Truman on the monitor)

You can't pull him back in without me.

(more reflective)

He's just acting out of character.

MOSES

What if he's

in

character?  What if he's

starting to act

in

character at last?  Have

you ever considered that?

MARLON

What're we doing here, Truman?

TRUMAN

This is where it started.

MARLON

Where

what

started?

TRUMAN

Things.  Things that don't fit.  Loose threads.

False steps.  Slips of the tongue.

MARLON

(irritated)

Make sense, Truman.  You going religious on me?

TRUMAN

(tears of bitterness welling in his eyes)

My father didn't want me to see what was over here.

Whatever it was, it's gone now.  I never shoulda

listened to him that day.  I knew it was wrong.

TRUMAN

There were a hundred people on the beach that

day.  Everybody knew what was going on except me.

MARLON

I don't want to put you down but why would

anybody go to all this trouble over you?

TRUMAN

Maybe I've been mistaken for somebody else.

(a memory triggered)

A couple of years ago, I tried to get hold of a

copy of Time Magazine.  The week before an ad said,

"Next Week:  Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".

TRUMAN

A guy with the same name as me in Time

Magazine.  It ain't a common name so I

looked out for it.  But the day it came

out, every newstand was sold out.  No

library had it.  I even wrote off for a

back-issue.  Never seen a copy to this day.

TRUMAN

Maybe I'm being set up for something.  You

ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your

whole life has been building to something?

MARLON

(becoming testy)

A coincidence.  Haven't you ever heard

of a coincidence?

TRUMAN

I'm a walking coincidence.  I can't count 'em.

No something's happening, Marlon.  I've got

to get to the bottom of it.

MARLON

(shaking his head in exasperation)

Of

what?!

Why're you doing this to yourself?

TRUMAN

I'm scared, Marlon.  I'm as scared as hell.

But I've never felt more alive.  It's just

like she said.

MARLON

(suddenly intrigued)

Who?

TRUMAN

It doesn't matter.  She was too beautiful for here.

really

confused.

TRUMAN

Can you lend me some money?  A hundred bucks.

MARLON

All I got on me is the takings from the machines.

Why do you need it?

TRUMAN

I'm going away for a while.

"Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".

MERYL

(attempting to open him up)

What's going on, Truman?  You're not yourself.

TRUMAN

(vague)

Maybe you just don't know me very well.

MERYL

We could do it right here, like we used to.

NARRATOR

(from television)

Travelling Down Under?  Global Travel is

turning rates to Australia upside down.  Round

Trip to Sydney only $829.  One way, $465.

Global Travel at Broadway and 44th...

TRUMAN

(abruptly getting up)

Lemme go to the bathroom.

MERYL

Don't be too long.

CHRISTOF

What happened overnight?

CHLOE

He couldn't do it, even on the sofa.

CHRISTOF

(smiling to himself)

God, that thing of his must be psychic.

(matter-of-fact)

He didn't masturbate?

CHLOE

Not for the last two inonths.

MERYL

(rubbing ointment into her wrists)

Aren't you gonna be late?

TRUMAN

I got a call in the area.

(nodding to her wrists)

What's the case?  Anything interesting?

MERYL

(dispassionate)

Rape on the subway.

MERYL

They're guilty as hell but they'll walk.  No

witnesses.  Her word against theirs.

(picking up her bag to leave)

Maybe we could meet for lunch today.

SECURITY GUARD

You a witness?

TRUMAN

Er, yes...

(suddenly losing heart)

No, no I'm not.

SECURITY GUARD

Closed session.

TRUMAN

I wanna book a flight to Australia.

AGENT

Where exactly?

TRUMAN

(believing she is being

deliberately obtuse)

Australia.

AGENT

(a trace of condescension)

Where

in Australia?  What

city?

TRUMAN

Sorry, Sydney.

Sydney,

Australia.  That's right.

AGENT

(entering the destination in her

computer)

For how many?

TRUMAN

(finding the question suspicious)

One.

AGENT

When do you want to leave, remembering, of

course, that you do lose a day on the way there?

TRUMAN

(more urgent than he intended)

Today.

AGENT

(reading off her computer screen)

I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for a

week.

TRUMAN

(suspicious)

A week.

AGENT

(patiently explaining)

It's the busy season.

TRUMAN

(paranoia showing)

You sure you're not trying to keep me here?

You are a

travel

agent, aren't you?  Your

job is to help people travel, not keep 'em

where they are.

(pointing to the agent's

name tag, "DORIS - Travel Agent")

Or maybe you're a different kind of agent, Doris?

AGENT

(showing amazing restraint)

I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship

departing for Australia tomorrow.  But you

wouldn't want to do that.

TRUMAN

Why wouldn't I?

AGENT

I thought you were in a hurry.

TRUMAN

(calming down)

That's right.

AGENT

You want to book the flight?

TRUMAN

You were expecting me, weren't you?

AGENT

It's non-refundable.

PROD. MANAGER

(unable to conceal his pride)

Happy?

CHRISTOF

(staring out at the pleasure

craft littering the harbor)

Can we contain him long enough?

PROD. MANAGER

I think so.

PROD. MANAGER

(anticipating his next question)

He flies at night.  Thick cloud cover to

disorient him.  Hopefully we'll knock him

out with complimentary cocktails, pull the

shades down during the movies.  He'll never know.

CHLOE

(referring to the surrounding scene)

Why go to all the trouble?

CHRISTOF

He believes she has the answer.

CHLOE

Why not just tell him she's dead?

CHRISTOF

It's too late for that.  That won't satisfy

him.  He's going to have to find out for himself.

See it with his own eyes.  Right now he needs

something genuine.

(rueful, all too aware

of the contradiction)

Even if we have to fake it.

"Please accept my resignation from

American Life & Accident, Inc. to

take effect immediately.

Yours tru"

TRUMAN

(to agent, picking up

a dictionary)

"Yours truly..."  You spell "truly"

"l...y" or "

e

...l...y"?

INSURANCE AGENT

I always write "Yours

faithfully..."

LAWRENCE

Where the hell have you been, Burbank?

What the hell's going on?

TRUMAN

That's what

I'd

like to know, Lawrence.

TRUMAN

I was just about to resign.  Isn't that

a laugh?  I just realized there's nothing

to resign

from,

is there?

LAWRENCE

Listen, don't bother with the resignation.

Just get the fuck outta here.

TRUMAN

(addressing the whole office)

Why're you all pretending?  Huh?

(gesturing to a computer terminal)

What is this a front for?  Why aren't I in

on the joke?  Was I away that day?!

TRUMAN

(hysterical)

I'm talking to you!  Who am I?!

LAWRENCE

(taken aback by the sudden violent act)

You better get outta here or I'm calling Security.

TRUMAN

(mimicking)

"Security!  I'm calling Security".

TRUMAN

You don't believe a single word you're saying!

(to the assembled group)

None of you do!

(suddenly talking to a sprinkler

head in the ceiling)

You hear me?!

SIMEON

(talking quietly into a

slim headset)

...and back to the close-up...

CHLOE

(to a hard-bitten Operator, staring

at the dictionary)

Do you think he sees the entry?

OPERATOR

Hard to tell.

CHRISTOF

(sarcastic)

Why don't we ask him?

CHLOE

(snapping back, referring to the book)

I don't know how it got there!

(to Operator)

(to the Mother, motioning to the sidewalk)

Say my name or I'll smash its head open.

TRUMAN

(vehement)

Say my

YOUNG MOTHER

(composing herself,

reaching out for her child)

Please, give him to me...

TRUMAN

(screaming above the baby's cries)

Say my name!  You

know

my name!

Say it!

YOUNG MOTHER

(bewildered)

I don't know you.

TRUMAN

(hysterical)

I mean it!  I'm ready to do it!

What's my

name?!!

TRUMAN

(entreating the young

woman, tears in his eyes)

This is your last chance!

TRUMAN

(his entire body shaking)

What...is...my...

name?!

YOUNG MOTHER

(clutching the baby to

her breast, without thinking)

Thank you, Truman.

TRUMAN

(referring to a distant

car on the expressway)

See that car way down there?  I bet it's a

Suburu station wagon.

TRUMAN

I predict the next four cars will be a

white Honda Civic, a blue and white

Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing,

a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender

and a motorcycle.

TRUMAN

There's the Honda...the Dodge...here

comes the dented Beetle...

TRUMAN

Look, damn you!

MERYL

(mocking)

Where's the motorcycle?

TRUMAN

(yelling after her)

Don't you want to know how I did that?

Maybe you

already

know.  Is that it?

MERYL

Where have you been?  I've been calling you

all day.

TRUMAN

Have you been concerned, Meryl?  Nice name.

"Meryl".  I always liked it.

MERYL

(matching his sarcasm)

Nice of you to say so after eight years.

TRUMAN

Actress's name, isn't it?  What's your

real

name?

MERYL

(rolling her eyes)

Oh, God.  What's got into you?

TRUMAN

Take a break. Meryl

(a knowing, almost foolish grin)

I

know.

MERYL

I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.

I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me...

TRUMAN

(irritated)

Drop it, I said.  It's over.

MERYL

(rambling on)

...we need more charcoal.

TRUMAN

Shut up!

MERYL

I'm gonna take a shower.

TRUMAN

(catching her wrist)

No.  We're going for a drive.

MERYL

What?!

TRUMAN

(as he shoves her into

the Oldsmobile)

For years I've been saying I want to go

some place, well now I'm ready to go.  Let's

just jump in the car and go.

TRUMAN

(as they speed down the suburban street)

I thought maybe, Atlantic City.

MERYL

(trying to mask her anxiety)

You hate gambling.

TRUMAN

That's right.  I do, don't I?

MERYL

So why do you wanna go?

TRUMAN

Cos I never have.  That's why you go places,

isn't it?  Cos you're curious.  I haven't

been curious since I was seven years old,

y'know that?  Back then you'd have to nail me

to the floor to keep me in one place.

CHRISTOF

How long to take Atlantic City out of

mothballs?

SIMEON

We could be up and running...three hours maybe.

CHRISTOF

Give me a number five gridlock on the

Jersey Turnpike.

TRUMAN

(a manic edge to his voice)

So much traffic, this time of day.  Does

that strike you as peculiar?

TRUMAN

(sneering at the sight of

the motorists)

Look at them.  You believe they're

fighting?  I don't believe it.

(shouting out the window

to the motorists)

Why don't you

slug

him, really make it authentic?

TRUMAN

(to Meryl, marveling)

Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully

synchronized, don't you agree?

MERYL

(incredulous)

You blaming

me

for the traffic?

TRUMAN

Should

I?

MERYL

You've never been on this road before.

You don't know what it's like.

TRUMAN

(manic)

That's true.  We could be stuck here

for hours.  Could be like this all the

way to Atlantic City.

MERYL

What the hell are you doing?

TRUMAN

You're right.  Let's go back.  I'm

sorry.  I don't know what got into me.

MERYL

Would you please slow down, Truman?

MERYL

Truman, that was the turnoff!

TRUMAN

I've changed my mind again.  What's Maine

like this time of year?! I've never been to

Maine.

(Truman looks up through the

windshield at a helicopter

tracking his progress)

Or let's just see where the road takes us.

MERYL

(pleading)

Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.

You wanna destroy yourself, you do it on your own!

TRUMAN

(eerily calm)

I think I'd like a little company.

CHRISTOF

(to Simeon)

What the hell is wrong with the "carousel"?

Keep them together.

SIMEON

(agitated)

They're rusty.  We can't keep up.

(rueful aside)

We don't know where he's going any more.

CHLOE

Oncoming is very thin.

TRUMAN

(to the anxious Meryl at his side)

Look down there, Meryl!...No cars!  I don't

run into traffic.  The traffic follows me around.

(excited by his discovery)

We're in a moving pack, don't you see?

CHRISTOF

(enthusing)

He's so close!  It's tantilizing!

CHLOE

You want to pull him over?

CHRISTOF

No police.  Not yet.  We shadow him.

We don't want him to panic.

CHLOE

He's trying to outrun the traffic.

CHRISTOF

He's trying to outrun the

world.

Keep him

on this route.

(to Simeon who is consulting

someone on his headset)

Are we ready?

TRUMAN

(to Meryl)

It's hard to go places, isn't it?

MERYL

There's been an accident, Truman.  We

have to go back.

TRUMAN

No.  There's no accident.  It'S just more stalling.

TRUMAN

What's going on?

OFFICER

(grim-faced, indicating the nearby

Indian Point nuclear power plant)

Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.

TRUMAN

Is there any way around?

OFFICER

The whole area's being evacuated.  A precaution.

MERYL

Truman!!  Come back!!

CHRISTOF

Did he see it?

CHLOE

I don't think so.

MERYL

Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're

not well.

TRUMAN

(ignoring her tears and medical advice)

Why do you want to have a child with me?

You can't stand me.

MERYL

That's not true.

TRUMAN

(suddenly angry)

Don't lie to me!

TRUMAN

Tell me what's happening?!

MERYL

(frightened but remaining poised)

I thought you knew everything.  What could

I tell you?

TRUMAN

(backing her up against

the kitchen bench)

You're

part

of this, aren't you?!

MERYL

Truman, you're scaring me!

TRUMAN

No, you're scaring

me,

Meryl!

TRUMAN

Stop this now or I kill your leading lady.

(to a lamp)

I know you can hear me.

ROMAN

(entreating Christof)

Get somebody in there!

CHRISTOF

(quiet but firm)

No.

SIMEON

(siding with the executive,

showing his true colors)

She's in trouble!  We've got to help her!

CHRISTOF (O.C.)

He's bluffing.  Call his bluff.

MERYL

(in reply to the voice in her

head, half-strangled due to the

pressure of the knife)

Do something...

TRUMAN

(wild-eyed)

Who are you talking to?!

MERYL

(incredulous)

You're

the one talking to the walls!

TRUMAN

No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you

talking to?  I swear I'll kill you, if

you don't tell me.

TRUMAN

(distraught, referring to the bed)

How could you buy this damn thing when you

know he drowned in front of me?!

TRUMAN

You have any idea what it's like to drown?

MERYL

(gasping for air)

Truman, stop it!

(to the ceiling)

Don't let him do it!

TRUMAN

(to a light fixture, threatening)

I'll

kill

her!

TRUMAN

(sneering at Meryl)

Right on time.  Cops must be telepathic.

TRUMAN

(wincing in pain)

Damn!

TRUMAN

(shouting through the closed door)

Stay where you are or I'll kill her!

MARLON (O.C.)

Truman?  It's me, Marlon.

MERYL

(distraught, dropping character,

forgetting herself)

They were going to let him kill me!

TRUMAN

People know who I am, my every move, complete

strangers know my name.  Even when there's

no one around, I feel the eyes on me.

MARLON

(reluctant admission)

I was in the bank today.  The Federal on

Lewis.  A clerk was talking about somebody

named Truman messing with her baby.  Is that

the stranger you're talking about?

TRUMAN

(half to himself, refusing to accept it)

No.  No.  I've never seen her before.

(registering Marlon's skepticism)

I know you already think I'm going out

of my mind but I genuinely believe the

world revolves around me somehow.  Everybody

seems to be in on it.

MARLON

It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure

that's not wishful thinking, you wishing

you'd made something more of yourself?  Christ,

Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had

an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters?

Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?

TRUMAN

That's just it.  I think I

am

somebody.

MARLON

(sympathetizing)

I used to dream all my friends and family

got together in a hotel room, thinking of

ways to fuck me up.

TRUMAN

Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes

I think it's for real.

MARLON

Tru, we've known each other since before

we could get a hard-on.

MARLON

The only way we ever made it through

high school was cheating off each other's

test papers.  Jesus, they were identical.

I always liked that, because whatever the

answer was, we was

right

together and we

was

wrong

together.

MARLON

The only night either of us ever spent

in jail, we spent

together

and I wet

myself but you never told anyone.

I was best man at your wedding and my

brother was best man at

my

wedding and

you didn't talk to me for a month over

that and I didn't blame you because you've

been more of a brother to me than he's

ever been.  And I never shoulda let

my Goddam father talk me into that.

MARLON

I know things haven't worked out for

either of us like we used to sit up on

Freemont Street all night and dream they

would.  We all let opportunities pass us

by, none of us asks for the dance as

often as we should.  I know that feeling

when it's like everything's slipping away

and you don't want to believe it so you

look for answers someplace else.  But,

well, the point is, I would gladly step

in front of traffic for you.

CHRISTOF

(hushed tones)

...and the last thing I'd ever do is

lie to you...

MARLON

(staring into Truman's

eyes, repeating the

words in his ear)

And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.

(pause)

Think about it, Truman, if everybody's

in on it, I'd have to be in on it too.

I'm

not

in on it cos there is no

it.

MARLON

(leaving his head close to

Christof)

I can't thank you enough.  I don't know

what happened.  He was so close.  It threw

me.  I'm indebted.

NARRATOR (O.C.)

You are watching "Truman - Total Record Of

A Human Life".  Everything that occurs here

is real.  There are no re-creations or

interruptions.  Due to the live and unedited

nature of the program, viewer discretion is

advised.

INTERVIEWER

(to camera)

Welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty

eight of "Truman" and there can scarcely have

been a more momentous week in the show's

history.  I'm your host, Michael Conners, and

this is a special edition of "Tru Talk", the

forum where we discuss and analyze recent

events with the show's award-winning creator

and producer, Christof.

(referring to the image

of Truman in the background)

I remind viewers that as this is a living

history, it is our practise to keep the image

of Truman on screen at all times.

(turning to Christof)

Welcome.

CHRISTOF

Thank you.

INTERVIEWER

Before we start taking calls, the huge surge in

ratings over the last few days, how do you hope

to sustain that audience now that Truman appears

to have reconciled himself, returned to "normal"?

CHRISTOF

Ratings have never been our primary goal.  I

imagine we'll lose those voycurs only interested

in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However

I'm certain our core audience will remain loyal.

INTERVIEWER

But recent events have been

so

dramatic, it does

raise the perennial question.  What keeps us

watching one man twenty-four hours a day -

eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in

contemplation?

CHRISTOF

It has to be the reality.

CHRISTOF

We've become increasingly frustrated watching

actors give us phony emotions, bored with

pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the

world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's

nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts.

no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but

it's genuine.  That's how he can support an

entire channel.

INTERVIEWER

A window onto the human condition?

CHRISTOF

I prefer to think of it as a

mirror.

Not only

does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he

gives us a glimpse of

ourselves.

INTERVIEWER

But how do you account for the popularity of

those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?

CHRISTOF

We find many viewers leave him on all night

for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your

child or your lover sleep?

INTERVIEWER

Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

INTERVIEWER

(into speaker phone)

Charlotte, North Carolina, for Christof.

MALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)

Hello?

INTERVIEWER

You're on, caller.  Go ahead.

MALE CALLER 1

Christof, it's a great honor to speak with you.

CHRISTOF

Thank you.

MALE CALLER 1

Truman has never been closer.  The way he looked

directly at us,

spoke

to us for the first time.

Do you think he'll ever work it out?

CHRISTOF

I don't believe so.  Not now.  He tested his

world, as we all do at certain times, and

eventually it

passed

the test.  You have to

understand, he is a man made-for-TV, the world

he occupies his only frame of reference.

No, for him to come even

this

close to the

truth is a remarkable testament to his

instincts.

INTERVIEWER

Sacramento, California, you're on "Tru Talk".

MALE CALLER 2 (O.C.)

How much of a strain has the last few days

placed on the actors?

CHRISTOF

Working on "Truman" has always been a huge

commitment for an actor, not just in terms

of separation from friends and family, but

since Truman essentially drives the plot,

it's a never-ending improvisation.  Recent

events have raised the pressure but also the

prestige.

INTERVIEWER

(cutting off the call)

Of course Truman has always been very much

in

on

casting.

CHRISTOF

As with our own lives, the only people he can't

cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final

approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead

role as was the case with his only real friend,

Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit

player.

INTERVIEWER

(pressing another line)

Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with world-renowned

videographer, Christof.

MALE CALLER 3 (O.C.)

Christof.  I've admired your work my whole life,

although I can't say I've seen it all.

CHRISTOF

Who can?

MALE CALLER 3

Can you settle an argument for me?  What's

the longest time Truman has been off-camera?

CHRISTOF

(trace of pride)

In his entire life, forty-two minutes.  A

technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of

that time.  The remainder generally results

from blindspots, in the early days, when Truman

would stray out of range of our cameras.

INTERVIEWER

The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.

(pressing another line)

Amagansett, Long Island, you're on "Tru Talk".

FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)

How can you say Truman lives a life like any other?

CHRISTOF

(sensing the thinly disguised

resentinent in the caller's voice)

I believe that to be so.  I often feel the only

difference between Truman's life and our own

is that his is being more thoroughly documented.

We all play our allotted roles--

FEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)

--He's not a performer.  He's a prisoner.

CHRISTOF

(rising to the challenge)

--He can leave at any time.  If his was more

than just a vague ambition, if he were

absolutely determined to discover the truth,

there's no way we could prevent him.  I think

what really distresses you, caller, is that

ultimately he

prefers

the comfort of his "cell"--

FEMALE CALLER 1

(as if trying to convince herself.

giving herself away)

--No, you're wrong!  He'll

prove

you wrong!

He can still do it!

CHRISTOF

(a thought occurring, looking

directly into camera)

Do I know you, caller?  Your voice sounds familiar.

INTERVIEWER

(from television)

Recording a human life from birth to death,

that's still the intention?  You still believe

Truman has more to contribute?

CHRISTOF

(still reflecting on the last call)

More than ever.  By unwittingly allowing us to

witness his struggles, he's constantly forcing

us to evaluate our own lives.  He gives us hope.

INTERVIEWER

Let's take another call.

(pressing a line)

London, England you're on "Tru Talk".

FEMALE CALLER 2

By definition Truman has to be free of censorship,

but has the recent violence and profanity

caused a problem for the sponsors...?

CHRISTOF (O.C.)

What are you looking for?

CHLOE

(not taking her eyes from screen)

He was premature, wasn't he?

CHRISTOF

Only by two weeks.

CHLOE

Curious even then?  Like he couldn't

wait to get started?

CHRISTOF

(feeling out where the

conversation is headed)

His eagerness to leave his mother's womb

also meant he was the one selected.

CHLOE

What was it like, the first show?

CHRISTOF

The ultimate live television.  In competition

with five other unwanted pregnancies - the

casting of a show determined by an air date

- he was the one who arrived on cue.

CHLOE

Is it true what you said...on the show tonight?

About letting him go if he wanted it badly

enough.  Would you really do that?

CHRISTOF

It won't come to that.

CHRISTOF

I hope we've got fresh extras.

CHLOE

(consulting a clipboard)

The rotation was made this morning.

CHRISTOF

(staring at a monitor, irritated)

I don't like the couple with the baby.

They'd never be together.

CHRISTOF

Who's doing wardrobe?  I keep seeing the

same wardrobe...

CHRISTOF (O.C.)

...everybody back to One...

CHRISTOF (O.C.)

...and, action background...

CHRISTOF (O.C.)

...nice...nice...I like the woman with the dog...

let's keep it moving...I want that traffic kept

together...everybody look like you've got places

to go...

CHRISTOF

I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand.

CHRISTOF

...Bodycam Two...

CHRISTOF

...streetlight eight...

CHRISTOF

...ready, Car-Cam One.  Go to One...

CHRISTOF

...and cut to interior...

CHRISTOF

...looser...

CHRISTOF

...and action, Vivien...

(aside, proud of his casting)

Looks just like Truman's mother at that age.

CHRISTOF

(incensed)

Damn, she missed her mark!

(impatiently to Simeon)

Why do we bother with walk-throughs if

nobody pays attention?  Give me a two-shot

of Truman and Vivien...go to the master

...hold the elevators...

(mustering patience, into microphone)

Vivien, press the elevator button again

...and make sure you catch his eye this time...

CHRISTOF

Good!  Perfect!  Cut to the interior...

CHRISTOF

...and Lawrence...

CHRISTOF

...nice look, Lawrence...and, Vivien...

LAWRENCE

(admiring aside to the remaining

fellow-males in the elevator)

I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

CHRISTOF

(to the meeting, referring to

Meryl by her real name)

Regrettably, I have to inform you that

Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract.

CHRISTOF

I'm sure we can all respect her reasons.

CHRISTOF

Her separation from Truman will be

orchestrated over the summer.

(more up-beat)

However, I'm pleased to announce that

television's first on-air conception will

still take place.  You witnessed the initial

contact this morning.

(glancing to Vivien, once

again using her real name)

You all know Claudia from her work in theatre.

Thankfully, Truman doesn't.

CHRISTOF

(referring to the bound documents

CHLOE passes to each cast member)

This is a copy of Claudia's back story.

Her character's name will be Vivien.

She's the new adjuster at the office.

CHRISTOF

We intend to entice Truman into the

affair as soon as possible.  Claudia will

make her advance at the seminar Truman's

attending next week.  Details are in your

schedules.  I'm sure you'll all make Claudia

welcome.

MARLON

(injecting a note of levity, more

sophisticated than the character he plays)

Question is, will

Truman

make her welcome?

CHRISTOF

(immediately back to business)

I don't have to tell you, how critical

the next few weeks will be.  This takes us

into the next generation.  When Truman's

child is born, the network will be switching

to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives.

VIVIEN

What happens when Truman and the baby are

both on camera together?

CHRISTOF

There will simply be duplicate coverage.

VIVIEN

(mischievous)

Let's just hope we don't have twins.

CHLOE

(uncharacteristically flippant)

When Truman dies do we go back to the

single channel?

BARMAN

What's he doing in

there?

PATRON

Meryl's at her mom's.  Maybe he's got an urge.

WAITRESS

(referring to Truman's overcoat)

What's with the coat?

BARMAN

(smirking at the irony)

Maybe he doesn't wanna be recognized.

PATRON

(remarking on Truman's clumsiness)

Nervous.

BARMAN

(exasperated)

Oh God, he never bought nothing.

WOMAN

Give him a break.  It's taken him thirty-

four years to get the nerve to go in there.

SIMEON

...Ready two.  Go to two.

SIMEON

And back to the medium.

SIMEON

...and wide...

OPERATOR

(aside to Simeon)

Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried?

SIMEON

(shrugs)

That loser pays our salary.

OPERATOR

He's given up on himself again.

SIMEON

Who cares?  Makes life easier for us.

He is what he is.

CHRISTOF

When did he start sleeping like that?

SIMEON

About the time Meryl left.

CHRISTOF

Is that the best shot we can get?

SIMEON

What's to see?

CHRISTOF

(referring to the debris in Truman's bedroom)

What happened to the room?

SIMEON

He started to reorganize.  I was going to

call you.  But half-way through, he gave

up and fell asleep.

CHRISTOF

I want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's

insurance convention.

CHRISTOF

Give me a shot from his wedding band.

SIMEON

(pointing out the ring on Truman's

bedside table)

He took it off.

CHRISTOF

(a trace of concern)

Why is he so still?  He's too still.

CHRISTOF

Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify.

CHRISTOF

Give me a preview.  An ECU on his torso.

CHRISTOF

(anxious, barking a command to Chloe)

Phone him.

CHRI STOF

(anticipating Chloe's question)

Wrong number.

CHRISTOF

(a trace of panic)

He didn't drink tonight?  No pills?

CHRISTOF

Hang up!

CHRISTOF

Get Marlon over there.

CHLOE

Under what pretext?

CHRISTOF

(letting his anxiety show)

Any fucking pretext!

MARLON

Tru!..Tru!..

MARLON

(shouting a warning)

I'm comin' in, Tru!

CHRISTOF

(quiet but firm)

Cut transmission.

CHRISTOF

(enraged)

I said, "Cut"!

CHRISTOF

There.  Freeze...Zoom into the chair...

CHRISTOF

Enhance.

CHRISTOF

(referring to the debris)

He wasn't making a mess.  He was engineering

a blind spot.

CHLOE

How does he know where the cameras are?

CHRI STOF

I don't know.

(noting the time-code on the monitor,

staring into the back of Simeon's head)

All I know is we've been filming a blow-up

doll for the last three hours.

SIMEON

(hanging up the phone)

We've declared a curfew.  Only the extras

required for the search are on the set.

Everyone else is at first positions.

CHRISTOF

All prop cars accounted for?

SIMEON

He has to be on foot.  He has the world's

most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.

CHLOE

The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug

if we don't make a statement within the next

hour.  The media is in a feeding frenzy.  The phone

lines are jammed.  Every network has a pirated shot

of Harlon and the dummy.

POLICE OFFICER

Any sign of him?

TRUMAN

(deliberately gravelling his voice)

Not yet.

POLICE OFFICER

(to Truman, as the car pulls away)

Take it easy.

MOSES

(to Christof who is still studying

the faces in a row of SEARCHERS)

Rumors are circulating he's dead.

ROMAN

(pacing nervously)

The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts.

CHRISTOF

(unconcerned, referring to the static

"STAND BY" graphic, now accompanied by

soothing classical music)

Why?  We're getting higher ratings for

that graphic than any time in the series.

CHLOE

(referring to the empty streets)

When we flush him out how do we explain this?

CHRISTOF

(deadpan)

We tell him the truth.

CHRISTOF

(joking darkly)

We're making a movie.

SIMEON

(hopeful)

We'll get him on this next sweep.

CHRISTOF

What have we missed?

SIMEON

It's just a matter of time.

CHRISTOF

No.  We've missed something.

SYLVIA

(from monitor)

You remember when you were a little boy...

SYLVIA

...Trust that boy...

CHRISTOF

Trust that boy...

(to Simeon)

We're not watching the sea.

SIMEON

(confused)

Why would we?

CHRISTOF

Sweep the harbor.

SIMEON

That's him!

CHRISTOF

Resume transmission.

CHRISTOF

(staring intently at the On-Air monitor)

What do we have on that boat?

CHOPPER PILOT

(over P.A.)

Alter course immediately.  You are

entering a restricted area.

TRUMAN

Fuck you!

YOUNG MAN 1

I knew he wasn't dead.

PILOT (over P.A.)

Alter course or we fire on your vessel.

TRUMAN

Get the hell away!  It's my life!

CHRISTOF

(into microphone to pilot, eerily composed)

Fire a warning.

CHOPPER PILOT (over P.A.)

Alter course.  Drop your sails.

SIMEON

(shocked at the near miss)

Jesus!  God!  Is he out of his mind?

CHRISTOF

(composed, into microphone to pilot)

Pull back.

CHRISTOF

How long will another chopper take?

SIMEON

By the time we pick up the pilots,

too

long.

CHRISTOF

We have to stop him for his own good.

Turn him back with the elements.

SIMEON

(hesitant)

There's no rescue boat in the area.  He

won't know what to do.

MOSES

(trying to appeal to Christof's

sense of reason)

For God's sake, Chris.  The whole world

is watching.  We can't kill him in front

of a live audience.

CHRISTOF

He was

born

in front of a live audience.

(never taking his eyes from

the screen, reassuring)

Don't worry, he's not willing to risk his life

for the truth.  His doubts will turn him back.

CHRISTOF

Kill the lights.

TRUMAN

(shouting above the storm)

I'm coming to find you Sylvia!  I'm making

myself deaf!

(screaming up to the sky)

You're going to have to kill me!  Come on!

SIMEON

(agitated)

It's not working.  He can sail that thing!

ROMAN

How can he sail?!  He's in insurance!  He

hasn't set foot on a boat since he was seven!

MOSES

(to Christof)

On the behalf of the studio, I demand you

cease transmission.

CHRISTOF

(defiant, to Operators)

Keep running!

(to Moses)

I take full responsibility.

(to Operator in front of radar-style screen)

How close?

OPERATOR

Very close.

CHRISTOF

Capsize him!  Tip him over!

CHLOE

(unable to contain herself

any longer, entreating him)

You can't!  He's tied himself to the wheel.

He'll drown!

SIMEON

(staring at Truman on the monitor,

becoming affected by his display of courage)

He doesn't care...

CHLOE

(to Christof, lunging for the control panel)

You lied, you hypocrite!  The only way he can

leave, is dead!

CHRISTOF

(enraged)

Do it!

SIMEON

(staring at the On-Air monitor, numb)

It's too late...

OPERATOR

Yeah!

GUIDE

...the soundstage roof houses over eight

hundred thousand lights of varying intensities

to faithfully recreate the constellations...

TRUMAN

(to the shocked passengers)

Nobody move!

(to the guide)

Drive!

TRUMAN

(to the guide, gesturing to the microphone)

Keep talking.  Say whatever you say!

GUIDE

Er,...the ocean tank contains over six hundred

and fifty million gallons of man-made salt

water, temperature-controlled...

TRUMAN

(to TOURIST, camcorder around his neck)

Act normal!  Keep filming!

CHILD

Please, Mister Truman.

CHRISTOF

(into the phone)

What do you mean he's not there?  We can't

have lost him again.

GUIDE

...on your left, the control room where the

angles are selected and the actors receive

direction.  Of course, the one place we can't

show you is the story department.  There is none.

(hesitant)

...Truman writes the script...

GUIDE

(frightened for his life)

Here he is!  It's him!

GUARD

(into radio)

We've got him trapped.

Really

outside for the first time in his life.

real

CHRISTOF

Truman...

TRUMAN

(quietly, half to himself,

half to Christof)

Even the stars I wished on...

CHRISTOF

(staring into the chasm,

remaining eerily calm)

You won't do it, Truman.  I've watched you

your whole life.

TRUMAN

(meeting Christof's gaze)

You never had a camera in my head.

TRUMAN

(incensed)

Something

was

real!

(a terrifying anguish)

Something had to be real!
