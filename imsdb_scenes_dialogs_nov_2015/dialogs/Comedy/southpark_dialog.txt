STAN

Can I get five tickets to Terrance and

Phillip Asses of Fire, please?

TICKET GUY

No.

KYLE

What'dya mean, no?

TICKET GUY

Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire is

rated 'R'. You kids can't get in.

CARTMAN

The hell we can't! My money is just as

good as any white person's!

TICKET GUY

You have to be accompanied by a parent or

guardian.

KYLE

But why?

TICKET GUY

Because this movie has naughty language,

and it might make you kids start using

bad words.

CARTMAN

Listen you son of a bitch, if you don't

let us in to see this movie I'm gonna

kick you square in the nuts.

TICKET GUY

Sorry, Charlie.

KYLE

Damn it!

TICKET GUY

Next, please?

STAN

This is terrible! This can't be

happening!!

KYLE

We HAVE to see this movie, dude!

CARTMAN

Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that

good anyway.

KYLE

Cartman! What the hell are you talking

about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!

CARTMAN

Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it

probably can't sustain itself over ninety

minutes.

IKE

Poo baba!

STAN

Wait! I've got an idea!

HOMELESS GUY

Uh, hi. I want five tickets to Terrance

and Phillip Asses of Fire.

TICKET GUY

You realize this movie is rated R? It may

not be appropriate for your little ones.

HOMELESS GUY

Oh.

(Turning to boys)

Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate

for you.

STAN

(Whispering)

Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to

buy us tickets, and NOT get your ten

bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle of

Vodka and not forget about how miserable

your life is and not stop the voices in

your head then go right ahead.

HOMELESS GUY

Five tickets please.

IKE

Purpre mama!

KYLE

Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!

BOYS

HOORAY!!!

PHILLIP

Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest

say to the Uranian gynecologist?

TERRANCE

I don't know, Phillip, what?

KYLE

That was sweet!

STAN

Where do they come up with this stuff?!

CARTMAN

How come Terrance and Phillip are so

weird looking?

KYLE

Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like

Ike!

CARTMAN

Oh.

Woa, dude! Did they say what I think they

said?

TERRANCE

Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I

PHILLIP

A letter from who, you shit sucking cock

master?

TERRANCE

It's from your mother.

PHILLIP

My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it

balls.'

STAN

Thank my lucky stars

Knew it in a word

The only thing I think I'd die

I can't stop now

My heart's awake

So this is why I'm ali-

WENDY

Hi, Stan!

WENDY

Ew! Gross!

GREGORY

Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly

brush.

STAN

Who are you, kid?

GREGORY

My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's

counter-cousin for some time.

WENDY

Want to skate with us?

GREGORY

We've been skating all morning. And

laughing and talking of memories past.

STAN

We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!

WENDY

That's nice, Stan.

KYLE

Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new

guy?

STAN

She's not my girlfriend, dude!

CARTMAN

Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip

movie. Who wants to touch me?  I said,

"Who wants to touch me?!"

SMALL BOY

Oooooh...

KIDS

Shut your fucking face,

Unclefucka!!

You're a shitsucking, cocksucking

Unclefucka!!

MR. HAT

Okay, children, let's take our seats.

MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)

We have a lot to learn and precious

little time.

MR. GARRISON

Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of

Sigfried and Roy?

KYLE

It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison,

it's Terrance and Phillip.

KIDS

TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!

MR. GARRISON

Well, anyway... Today children, our

friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all

about the environment.

MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)

That's right, Mr. Garrison. The

environment is what surrounds us. It is

what we live and breathe.

CARTMAN

I hate the environment.

KYLE

Dude, how can you hate the environment?

CARTMAN

'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and

fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

MR. GARRISON

Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?

CARTMAN

Fragile?

KYLE

No, he's talking about fuck, dude. You

can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison.

MR. GARRISON

Kyle!

CARTMAN

Why the fuck not?

MR. GARRISON

Eric!

STAN

Dude, you just said fuck again.

MR. GARRISON

Stanly!

KENNY

Mph.

MR. GARRISON

Kenny!

CARTMAN

That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip

can say something, I should be able to

say it too!

BEBE

Wow, Cartman's cool!

CLYDE

He's like Terrance and Phillip!

CARTMAN

Fuckin' a right.

MR. GARRISON

How would you like to go to the

principal's office?

CARTMAN

How would you like to gargle rat jiz?

MR. GARRISON

WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!

CARTMAN

I said -

CARTMAN

(Through megaphone)

HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GARGLE RAT JIZ?!

KYLE

Oh, dude we are fucked now.

STAN

Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw

the Terrance and Phillip movie!

KYLE

Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

I am VERY disappointed in you boys!

You should be ASHAMED of yourselves! I've

already called in your parents, but first

I want you to THINK about what you've

done.

CARTMAN

Principal Victoria, can I ask a question?

PRINCPAL VICTORIA

What?

CARTMAN

What's the big fucking deal?

STAN

Yeah.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

AGH!! I want to know where you heard

these horrific obscenities!

STAN

Nowhere.

KYLE

I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few

times before...

STAN

Yeah!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison

ever said-

(Reading)

'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass

spelunker' in school!

STAN

Oh, oh...

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

Thank you all for coming on such short

notice. As you can see, your boys are all

being disciplined.

STAN'S MOTHER

This just isn't like you, Stanley!

KYLE'S MOTHER

What did my son say, Principal Victoria?

Did he say the S word?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

No, it was worse than that...

KYLE'S MOTHER

(Gasping)

The F word?!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

No, worse. Here's a short list of the

things they've been saying.

STAN'S MOTHER

Oh dear God...

KYLE'S MOTHER

What is 'fisting'?

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

That's when the fist is inserted into the

anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

What?

KYLE'S MOTHER

(To Kyle)

Young man, you will tell Peincipal

Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all

these horrible phrases!

KYLE

I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath,

and swore ourselves to secrecy!

CARTMAN

It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!

STAN

Dude!

CARTMAN

What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of

here.

KYLE'S MOTHER

Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt!

Not again!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

What is Terrance and Phillip?

KYLE'S MOTHER

Terrance and Phillip are two VERY

untalented, unfunny actors from Canada.

Their TV show is filled with toilet humor

and bad language and is just complete

garbage.  Now it appears they have a

movie and I'm positive it's not suitable

for children!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

Well, it looks like I'll have to send a

warning letter out to parents. I have to

put a stop to this before MORE children

see 'Terrance and Phillip'.

CARTMAN

Everybody's already fucking seen it.

MS. CARTMAN

Eric!

CARTMAN

I'm sorry! I can't help it!! That movie

has warped my fragile little mind.

KYLE'S MOTHER

Alright, boys, that's enough. Get out and

let us adults speak.

KYLE'S MOTHER

We must take action on this immediately.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give

detention to those boys.

KYLE'S MOTHER

Forgive me for saying so, Principal

Victoria, but your methods are too...

Shall we say... soft?  As head of the

PTA, I am exercising my right under

article 42 of the PTA code.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

Article 42!  You don't mean-?!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is

impeaching you.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

But I-

KYLE'S MOTHER

You are officially relieved of your

duties as principal of this school!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Get out of that chair! The PTA is in

charge now!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Attention students. We are now enforcing

a new dress code at South Park

Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts

are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone

wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is

to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY.

KIDS

HOOORAY!!!

WENDY

Hello?

NEWS ANCHOR

All over America, kids are flocking to

the R rated film, 'Terrance and Phillip

Asses of Fire'. Here with a special

report, is a quadriplegic midget in a

bikini.

Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI

Thanks, Tom. It appears that the effects

of the Canadian Comedy are far reaching

indeed. All over America, children seem

to be influenced.

A TEACHER is on stage with a young spelling bee contestant.

TEACHER

Alright, this is for the silver medal.

Spell 'Forensics'.

KID

Oh, fuck that, why should I fucking have

to spell forensics?

KID

Here you go; S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S,

FORENSICS.

CUT TO:

CLOWN

Hey kids, how would you like to see some

magic tricks?!

KIDS

FUCK YOU!!

CLOWN

Huh?

CHILD

Yeah, and fuck your stupid little red

nose.

CHILD 2

Yeah, and fuck your yellow hair. And fuck

your gay pants.

Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI

And the devastating impact of the

Canadian phenomenon is Terrance and

Phillip's new hit song, "Shut Your

Fucking Face, Unclefucka" which has

climbed the charts with a bullet --

TERRANCE & PHILLIP

(Singing)

Shut your fucking face!

Unclefucka!!

NEWS ANCHOR

Thanks, midget. Shocking report.  The

controversy surrounding the Terrance and

Phillip movie began in the small mountain

town of South Park, Colorado where the

local PTA banned the movie.  With us

tonight is the head of the South Park

PTA, Sheila Brofloski-

NEWS ANCHOR

Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing

this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or

is it Canada?

KYLE'S MOTHER

Canada!

NEWS ANCHOR

Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the

Canadian Minister of Movies.

NEWS ANCHOR

Thank you, Minister, for joining us.

CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES

Thanks for having me, buddy.

NEWS ANCHOR

Minister, parents all over America are

concerned about your country's

entertainment. Your thoughts?

CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES

Well, the film is R rated, and it's not

intended for children-

KYLE'S MOTHER

Oh but OF COURSE children are going to

see it!!

CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES

Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The

fact is that we Canadians are quite

surprised by your outrage-

KYLE'S MOTHER

YOU JUST DON'T CARE!

CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES

Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The

United States has graphic images of

violence on television all the time, what

is that one show? COPS? And car crashes

caught on tape? We can't believe that a

movie with some foul language and fart

jokes would piss you off so much.

KYLE'S MOTHER

BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!

CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES

Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ...

... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.

NEWS ANCHOR

But minister, it isn't like this film is

the first troublesome thing to come out

of Canada. Let us not forget Brian Adams

a few decades ago.

CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES

What?

KYLE'S MOTHER

The Canadians are just mad that we

mothers here in South Park have the

chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or

not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children

are now safe from your Canadian smut!

TERRANCE

Well, Terrance I hope you learned

something from this whole experience.

PHILLIP

I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a

boner biting dick fart fuck face!

TERRANCE

Say Phillip, want to see the Northern

Lights?

PHILLIP

You bet, Terrance!

PHILLIP

HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by

lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!

TERRANCE

(Just a skull)

I sure did, Phillip!!

STAN

Did you see that, Wendy?

WENDY

Yup.

KYLE

Man, that movie gets better every time I

see it!

CARTMAN

Yeah, but you know what? That whole part

about lighting farts is bullshit. You

can't do that.

KENNY

Mph rmpmh rm.

CARTMAN

No way.

STAN

Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?

WENDY

Stan... I think you and I need some time

apart.

STAN

WHAT?!

CARTMAN

Oh shit.

WENDY

It's just... It's obvious that we don't

have a whole lot in common anymore. I

need somebody who's... a little deeper.

STAN

But Wendy, I can go-

WENDY

No. Don't speak. You'll only make things

more annoying. Goodbye, Stan.

KYLE

Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance

and Phillip is funny can fuck off

anyways.

STAN

(Insincere)

Yeah...

KENNY

Mph rmph rm!!

CARTMAN

No you can't Kenny!

KENNY

Mph rm rmph!!

CARTMAN

Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED

DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!

KENNY

KENNY

NURSE

DOCTOR GAUCHE

DOCTOR GAUCHE

DOCTOR GAUCHE

DOCTOR 2

DOCTOR GAUCHE

Damn it! I am NOT going to lose this

DOCTOR GAUCHE

Kenny.  Kenny, can you hear me?

KENNY

(Weakly)

Mph rmph rm...

DOCTOR GAUCHE

How are you feeling, son?

KENNY

mph.... rmph....

DOCTOR GAUCHE

Great... Son, I have some bad news.  We

accidentally replaced your heart with a

baked potato.  You have about seven

seconds to live.

KENNY

Mrm?!

STAN

Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!

KYLE

You bastards!!

DOCTOR GAUCHE

Damn it!  It never gets any easier!

Anybody get the score of that Broncos

game?

NURSE

I'm sorry...

KENNY'S MOTHER

Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

KENNY'S DAD

You bastards!

KYLE'S MOTHER

I knew this would happen! Those bastard

Canadians have now killed a child! Can't

people see the damage that film is

doing?!

STAN'S MOTHER

He was killed doing something he saw in

the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip...

THEY killed Kenny.

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

You bastards.

KYLE'S MOTHER

This is it! The time for action is NOW!!

(Singing)

Something must be done!

This is like a spreading rash!

They're pulling out our children's

brains

and filling them with trash!

Can't you see what this is leading

to?

A world of smut and sex and poo!

I believe the good fight has begun!

Something must be done!

STAN'S MOTHER

I agree!

(Singing)

Something must be done!

We must take action fast!

My child used to say 'please and

thank you'

Now he says suck my ass!

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

And my boy was the sweetest boy the

world had ever known!

until those damn Canadians brought

that filth into our home!

I agree that there is now a battle

to be won!

We can't just stand here singing!

Something must be done!

KENNY'S MOTHER

But what are we going to do against the

media machine? It's so big and powerful!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Right! And we can use that same media

machine to exploit OUR cause!  We've got

to let the whole world know what the

Canadians did to your son!

PARENTS

Yeah!!

KYLE'S MOTHER

COME ON!

PARENTS

(Singing)

Something must be done!

Something's gotta give!

This world has become a bitch in

which

we have no desire to live!

KENNY'S MOTHER

My boy could have become a doctor

Or a lawyer rich and true

Instead he burned up like a piggy

on a bar-b-que!

KYLE'S MOTHER

We will fight for children's rights

in memory of your son!

PARENTS

We can't just stand here singing!

Something must be done!

PARENTS

We've pushed and pushed it to the

edge

And now the time has come!

Something's gotta change!

It's time to buy a gun!

We can't just stand here singing

No we can't just stand here singing

No we can't just stand here

singing!

Something must be done!!!

CARTMAN

(Dazed)

I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him

a hundred dollars!

KYLE

Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.

CARTMAN

No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I

don't have to pay him!

KYLE

Oh.

KYLE (O.S.)

I can't believe he's dead.

CARTMAN (O.S.)

Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now.

Like this has all happened before...

KENNY

Mph rmph rm!

STAN

How can they do this?

KYLE

It isn't fair!

CARTMAN

Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan

O'Brian tonight, we could at least go

watch that.

KYLE'S MOTHER

THIS must be him, officer! This is the

scum that sold R rated tickets to

children!

TICKET GUY

What?! Jesus Christ, I didn't mean to!

OFFICER BARBRADY

You can explain downtown!

TICKET GUY

(Getting dragged away)

Oh shit! Hey it's not MY fault! You

should arrest those pervert Canadians!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Oh we will, Mr. Scumbag... We will...

CONAN O'BRIAN

Our next guests have the number one movie

Terrance and Phillip!

PHILLIP

Hello, Conan!

question...

PHILLIP

I just farted Terrance back into the

stone age!

BROOKE SHIELDS

I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon!

TERRANCE

Nobody cares, Brooke Shields!

CONAN O'BRIAN

Terrance and Phillip... Whose idea was

it, to have a person lighting a fart on

fire in your movie?

Who is responsible

for that?

TERRANCE

Phillip, I think our friend Conan has

been working too hard.

CONAN O'BRIAN

Say it! It was YOUR idea to have someone

light a fart on fire in your movie!

PHILLIP/TERRANCE

(Together)

It was our idea to have someone light a

fart on fire in your movie.

KYLE'S MOTHER

(Into her lapel)

That's it!  Move, move, move!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Terrance and Phillip, you are under

arrest for working in America without the

proper documents! WE GOT YOU!

KYLE

Dude, what the hell is going on?

TERRANCE

Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed

by The Conan O'Brian Show!!

PHILLIP

This little scrotum sucker willfully

deceived us!

(Pointing to Conan)

You are a bad man!

TERRANCE

And you call yourself a Canadian!

(To Phillip)

I told you we should of done Leno!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Don't listen to them, Mr. O'Brian.

They're master manipulators. You did a

good job.

CONAN O'BRIAN

BROOKE SHIELDS

TERRANCE

US?! This is your mess, outraged mother!!

STAN

Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and

Phillip!

KYLE

Our moms suck!

CARTMAN

This could mean... No more Terrance and

Phillip - EVER!

CANADIAN AMBASSADOR

As The Canadian Ambassador, I hereby

condemn the actions taken by America in

apprehending Terrance and Phillip!

CANADIAN AMBASSADOR

We demand their release IMMEDIATELY!! As

you can see from this graph, the entire

economy of Canada relies on Terrance and

Phillip! Without them we are doomed to

recession!

KYLE'S MOTHER

If I may?

KYLE'S MOTHER

As president and founder of M.A.C., I

would like to state-

UNITED NATIONS HEAD

Excuse me, M.A.C.?

KYLE'S MOTHER

Yes, Mothers Against Canada.

UNITED NATIONS HEAD

Kay.

KYLE'S MOTHER

I would like to state that Canada must

learn to stop infiltrating our country

with its graphic art!

CANADIAN AMBASSADOR

Last time I checked America was a free

country!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Look at this!

KYLE'S MOTHER

This woman's child was KILLED by your

country's humor! Look how upset she is!

CANADIAN AMBASSADOR

We will continue to sell Terrance and

Phillip videos to anyone retarded enough

to buy it!!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Then you leave me no choice... I call for

an EMBARGO on ALL Canadian Imports!!!

CARTMAN

What the hell do you mean I can't get

Cheesy Poofs?!

BOB

Sorry, kid. Cheesy Poofs are a Canadian

export. We can't carry them any more.

KYLE

Who the hell made up that law?!

CARTMAN

You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD

Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation

with a delightful cheddar crunch.

BOB

There's nothing I can do. I can still

sell you Cheese-o's.

CARTMAN

FUCK Cheese-os and FUCK you!

CARTMAN

Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!

STAN

About what?

CARTMAN

About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This

whole thing has gone too far!

KYLE

I don't really think you need Cheesy-

Poofs, tubby-

KYLE'S MOTHER

Boys, we have to have a difficult

discussion.

KYLE

We already know what you did. We saw it

on television.

STAN

Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and

Phillip?

STAN'S MOTHER

Stanly, you're too young to understand

what's good for you. That's why we

mothers have taken charge.

KYLE

But they fucking didn't do anything

wrong!

CARTMAN

Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and

outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?

KYLE'S MOTHER

What was that word, young man!?

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone

licks your ass for-

KYLE'S MOTHER

I know what it is!

CARTMAN

(To his mother)

Lick someone's ass?!

KYLE'S MOTHER

The Terrance and Phillip movie has

obviously done irreparable damage to

their brains.  We have to put them in

rehab right away.

KYLE

What's that?

KYLE'S MOTHER

You boys need help.  There are rehab

centers that specialize in treating

people with chronic addictions to bad

language.

STAN'S MOTHER

There are?

KYLE'S MOTHER

Well no, I guess not...  But we will

establish the first of its kind right

here in South Park.  All the children in

town will have to attend and receive

treatment from the school counselor Mr.

Mackey!  Ooh I just love when I get these

sorts of ideas!

CARTMAN

Why?  So you can fuck up our life some

more?

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that

way!

CARTMAN

But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to

fucking bad language!  I don't have a

fucking problem!

KENNY

Mphrmo?

KENNY

MPHR!! MMLY MMT!

KENNY

MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!

SATAN

Fallen one... We have such sights to show

you!

SATAN

I am Satan. I am your God, now.

KENNY

MPH RM!!!

SATAN

Come with me. I will show you what

delightful pain awaits.

KENNY

MMMMMPHPHP!!!!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell,

kid! Relax! Take a load off!!

SATAN

You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't

you?!

KENNY

MMMPPH!!!

MR. MACKEY

Mkay, it's come to my attention, that you

boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay.

Now the sooner you recognize your

problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you

back to your third grade homeroom where

you belong.

KYLE

But they're just words, Mr. Mackey. Our

parents are over-reacting.

BEBE

Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even

like Terrance and Phillip!

CARTMAN

Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having

Cheesy Poof withdrawal...

MR. MACKEY

Mkay, kids from all over the State have

been brought here, because you all share

the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's

start with you.

GREGORY

My name is Gregory... And I have a potty

mouth.

CARTMAN

You've got a stupid accent too.

MR. MACKEY

Eric, that is not appropriate.

CARTMAN

What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the

ear.

MR. MACKEY

Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly

what I'm talking about. We have to change

the way you think.

GREGORY

How are you gonna do that?

MR. MACKEY

There are times when you get suckered in,

by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en.

But it's when you do these things too

much

(Singing)

That you've got to clear your head

and get back in touch...

MR. MACKEY

You can do it, it's all up to you,

mkay?

With a method, there's nothing you

can't do, mkay?

You don't have to spend your life

addicted to crack

Homeless on the streets giving hand-

jobs for cash

as long as you follow this simple

plan

I'm fully convinced that it's,

easy, mkay...

MR. MACKEY

Step one: Think about fun. Think

about all that you'll miss addicted

to this

Step two: Think it all through.

Think how's this gonna change my

life, what am I gonna miss?

Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug

anything that gets in your way!

And step four: Just don't do it

anymore - it's easy, Mkay!

MR. MACKEY

Come on, kids! Sing along!

KIDS

(Extremely half-assed)

You can do it, it's all up to you

mkay?

With a method, there's nothing you

can't do, mkay?

We don't have to spend our lives

addicted to crack

Homeless on the streets giving hand-

jobs for cash

MR. MACKEY

As long as you follow my simple

plan

I'm fully convinced that it's,

easy, mkay...

KIDS

Step one: Think about fun. Think

about all that you'll miss addicted

to this Step two: Think it all

through. Think how's this gonna

change my life, what am I gonna

miss?

Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug

anything that gets in your way!

And step four: Just don't do it

anymore - it's easy, Mkay!

MR. MACKEY

It's easy, Mkay?!

KYLE'S MOTHER

What the hell do they think this is?!

Summer camp?!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Mr. Mackey, what is going on?!

MR. MACKEY

Uh, we're just, starting our program...

KYLE'S MOTHER

This is NOT a place for fun and games!

This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!!

We at MAC have a trial to go to!

MR. MACKEY

Mkay.

CARTMAN

God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.

NEWS REPORTER

Tom I'm standing in front of the U.S.

Supreme Court where the most important

trial of the - day - is happening.

Thousands of people have shown up from

all over the country to show their

outrage and disgust at Canada. Joining me

now is Mrs. McKormick, mother of the poor

little boy who was killed by the

Canadians.

NEWS REPORTER

Mrs. McKormick, you must really hate the

Canadians.

KENNY'S MOTHER

Yes, yes I do, Tom.

NEWS REPORTER

Did you ever think you would see the day

when thousands of people were wearing

your son Kenny on T-shirts?

KENNY'S MOTHER

No I didn't. But if any of you would like

one they're 14.95. Available in blue or

white.

NEWS REPORTER

Well, we can only imagine the intense,

vehement trial that is going on inside.

JOHNNY COCHRAN

Terrance and Phillip... You knowingly,

with malice of forethought were trying to

destroy American culture, yes or no?

JOHNNY COCHRAN

YES OR NO!

STAN

Shh! Mr. Mackey's gonna hear us!

TERRANCE

The Americans are just showing their TRUE

COLORS as smelly bastards.

PHILLIP

Fight the power!

TERRANCE

The young boy that died lit himself on

fire. It was unfortunate, but how can

they blame US?

PHILLIP

Don't believe the hype!!

KIDS

(Adlib)

Yeah! WooHoo!

TERRANCE

You cannot oppress us! We will continue

to pursue our art. We know there are

Americans out there who will help us!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Your 'ART' is shallow and immature! We

Americans do NOT allow that for our

children!!

PHILLIP

Please. You teach your children that

America is the land of the free. But it's

all bullshit. You're one of the most

conservative countries in the world!

TERRANCE

The problem is you don't allow your

children to think for themselves. You try

to raise them in a protective bubble, and

then when they finally get old enough,

they realize they've been lied to, and

they resent you for it.

PHILLIP

Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so

fucked up.

KYLE'S MOTHER

THAT IS ENOUGH!!

TERRANCE

WAKE UP AMERICA! YOUR government censors

YOU from the world.

KYLE'S MOTHER

NO THEY DON'T!

PHILLIP

YES THEY DO! AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU! IN

MARCH OF LAST YEAR, THE AMERICAN

GOVERNMENT-

KYLE

What happened?

WENDY

The station CONVENIENTLY went blank.

CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER

ATTENTION AMERICA!! You have taken our

national treasure Terrance and Phillip.

We, in turn, have taken yours... The

Smothers Brothers!

CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER

I'll let you catch your breath... Now,

release Terrance and Phillip, or else we

will EXECUTE your beloved Smothers

Brothers!!

TOMMY SMOTHERS

Please listen to them!!

DICK SMOTHERS

They're not fucking around!!

CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER

We're not fucking around. This is not

aboot deals. This aboot dignity. This is

aboot freedom... This is aboot respect.

RETURN Terrance and Phillip NOW!!!

CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER

Oh yeah... AND FUCK YOU, AMERICA!

MR. MACKEY

Okay kids, for today's rehabilitation

activity, we're going to watch the

Terrance and Phillip movie.

STAN

What?!

KYLE

Sweet!

MR. MACKEY

Now, this is an EDITED version of the

movie, which was put out by the MPAA.

That's the Motion Picture Association of

America.

WENDY

Isn't that censorship?

MR. MACKEY

No the MPAA is NOT a censorship group.

WENDY

Why not?

MR. MACKEY

Uh... Because they say so... Mkay. Now I

want you to watch this movie, with all

the immature profanity taken out, and

notice how much better a movie it

becomes...

KIDS

HOORAY!!!

DUBBED PHILLIP

Hey Terrance. I feel like I'm going to

pass gas near your head.

DUBBED TERRANCE

I would rather you didn't, Phillip.

DUBBED PHILLIP

Oh? Is that so?

TERRANCE

Oh, you are such a maroon!

PHILLIP

You would know, dummy.

TERRANCE

You are pigeon-like in your intelligence.

CARTMAN

WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

KYLE

Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!

MR. MACKEY

So you see, the point and the theme of

the film is kept intact. And of course,

the MPAA didn't cut out any of the

graphic violence. What did you think?

CARTMAN

Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to

get the taste of ass out of my mouth from

that piece of shit movie.

MR. MACKEY

Eric, you're not watching your mouth!

CARTMAN

You get me Cheesy Poofs with the

delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch

my fucking mouth!

MR. MACKEY

Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated.

Help me to help you!

CARTMAN

Help yourself prickfuck!

MR. MACKEY

I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little

asshole!

CARTMAN

Ha, ha, you stupid asshole prickfuck.

KYLE'S MOTHER

How is the children's progress?

MR. MACKEY

Very encouraging. Most of the children

have been weened from their naughty

mouths.

KYLE'S MOTHER

What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?

MR. MACKEY

(Nervous)

Well, some of the children just don't

respond to 12 step programs.

KYLE'S MOTHER

Then we'll have to resort to plan B and

call the v-chip organization.

MR. MACKEY

Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been

fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.

KYLE'S MOTHER

(Evil)

I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate

times call for desperate measures, Mr.

Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of

your situation.

MR. MACKEY

(Nervous)

Alright, I'll make the call...

JUDGE

Madam foreman, have you reached a

verdict?

FOREMAN

We have, your honor.

JUDGE

How find you, the jury?

FOREMAN

We the jury, find the defendants...

Terrance and Phillip... GUILTY of being

complete bastards.

KYLE

Oh no!

TERRANCE

Oh oh, Phillip. You know what this means?

PHILLIP

We'll be farting bread and water for a

few years.

JUDGE

Terrance and Phillip, for crimes against

the great nation of America you are

hereby sentenced to DEATH.

TERRANCE

DEATH?! You gotta be shittin' me!

PHILLIP

Aghgh!

KYLE

Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!

STAN

How do we do that?

WENDY

You raise awareness by distributing

buttons, stickers and leaflets.

CARTMAN

That'd be sweet! We could try to bring

back Cheesy Poofs!

KYLE

Yeah, let's make Free Terrance and

Phillip buttons!

WENDY

You guys don't even care. All you care

about is seeing Terrance and Phillip fart

on each other more.

STAN

Yeah!

WENDY

This is about freedom of speech, Stan,

about censorship.

GREGORY

Yes, what's next? Barcodes on our

forearms? This country is the most

fascist of all.

STAN

What the hell are you talking about, kid?

WENDY

You don't get it Stan... You just don't

get it.

STAN

What? What don't I get?

(To Kyle)

What don't I get?

KYLE

I don't know, dude.

STAN

That British dickhole is what's taking

Wendy away from me!

KYLE

I thought she wasn't your girlfriend,

dude.

STAN

She's Not! But if she WAS it would be

THAT little asshole who's fucking it up

for me!

MR. MACKEY

Mkay, children, you've all made terrific

progress, and are hereby done with the

eight step program.

CARTMAN

Thank God, that sucked ass.

MR. MACKEY

Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you

need to work more on not saying the F

word and the N word.

CARTMAN

The N word?

MR. MACKEY

(Reading)

Norwegian Ass Raper.

CARTMAN

Oh yeah.

MR. MACKEY

The rest of you are graduated. You can go

home today.

CARTMAN

I don't graduate?! WHAT THE FUCK IS

THIS?! THIS IS BULLSHIT?!

MR. MACKEY

Free Terrance and Phillip? Oh no... Mkay.

KYLE

(Proudly)

We're protesting!

STAN

Yeah!

MR. MACKEY

Well, boys, it might interest you to know

that your FRIENDS the Canadians have just

bombed the U.S.

STAN

They did?!

MR. MACKEY

Yes, at six this morning they bombed the

heck out of Cleveland.

KYLE

Oh. That doesn't count.

WENDY

They only bombed Cleveland because we're

going to Execute two of their citizens!!

MR. MACKEY

Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting

political, I'll throw your skinny little

butt right back into rehab. Mkay?

CARTMAN

HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?!

DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!

MR. MACKEY

No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for

you...

SATAN

Prepare thyself for unending pain!

Unparalleled misery!!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked

up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer

again.

KENNY

Mrph mprph!!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

What? What do you mean you don't belong

here? Relax guy, hell is for children.

KENNY

Mrph mprhm mm rmph!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

A deal? You wanna make a deal with the

devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o'

fun.

SATAN

(To Saddam)

Saddam, would you let me do my job

please!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid

wants.

KENNY

Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Oh, you want out of hell, huh?

SATAN

Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The

whole POINT of hell is that you don't

WANT to be here!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you

want out of hell, all you have to do is

collect 10 proofs of purchases from

'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich,

chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring

me ten proofs of purchases and we'll

grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.

KENNY

Mrph?

SADDAM HUSSEIN

I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky

Smores are now available in stores

everywhere! No biggie!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

(To Kenny)

Well what are you waiting for pal?!  Get

to it!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

HA HA HAHA!! What a dumbass!!

SATAN

I don't see why you have to belittle me

in front of people like that.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke.

Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only

available up on Earth. He'll never get

'em, see?

SATAN

Sometimes I just think you don't have any

respect for me.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Hey, come here, guy.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Who's my cream puff?

SATAN

I am.

MOTHER

Is that a new pearl bracelet, Mrs.

McKormick?

KENNY'S MOTHER

Why yes. Yes it is.

KYLE'S MOTHER

As our next official order of business

here at M.A.C., we will test the new V-

chip. As most of you know, the V-chip was

created to lock children out of watching

certain shows on television. And now the

N.I.H. has created a new, exciting

product that they can tell us all about.

Here is the Surgeon General, Dr.

Pangloss.

DOCTOR PANGLOSS

Thank you, parents.

DOCTOR PANGLOSS

The machinery of the new 'V-chip' is very

simple, and similar to that of the V-

chip. The chip is placed just under the

subject's skin, where it emits a small

but painful shock of electricity whenever

an obscenity is uttered.

STAN'S FATHER

Now wait a minute, are you telling us

that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid

is swearing?

DOCTOR PANGLOSS

It's just like a lie detector. Certain

things happen in you when you swear just

like when you lie, the chip picks up on

this and gives the subject a shock.

DOCTOR PANGLOSS

We are very excited to see the results of

this test.

(Calling)

Patient 453, would you step out here,

please?

DOCTOR PANGLOSS

Patient 453 here has been fitted with the

new v-chip...

CARTMAN

My head hurts.

DOCTOR PANGLOSS

Don't worry about that. Now, I want you

to say 'Doggy.'

CARTMAN

Doggy.

DOCTOR PANGLOSS

Notice that nothing happens.

(To Cartman)

Now say 'Montana.'

CARTMAN

Montana.

DOCTOR PANGLOSS

Good. Now 'Pillow'.

CARTMAN

Pillow.

DOCTOR PANGLOSS

Alright, now I want you to say

'horsefucker.'

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Go ahead, it's alright, Eric.

CARTMAN

Horsefuck-

CARTMAN

AGAAHGAHGAH!!!!!

CARTMAN

OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-

CARTMAN

OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T

FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--

DOCTOR PANGLOSS

Success!! Our device works perfectly! We

will begin mass production immediately!

KYLE'S MOTHER

And so we have succesfully removed the

Canadian smut from all of our children's

brains.

We have made changes at school to ensure

that our kids are NEVER AGAIN exposed to

smut!!!!!!! It's OVER!

STAN

Hi Wendy.

WENDY

(Not even looking)

Hi Stan.

KYLE

Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats

ass about you.

STAN

(Eyes still on Wendy)

I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!

KYLE

Good thing she was never your

girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.

KYLE

Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in

your head or your ass?

STAN

What's the difference?

CARTMAN

Very funny dickhead-

CARTMAN

OW!  FUCK-

CARTMAN

AY!

KYLE

Whoa!  What the hell was that?!

STAN

Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him

ever time he cusses!

KYLE

Hey Cartman.

CARTMAN

What?

KYLE

You know, me and Stan were just talking

about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck

you are.

CARTMAN

Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-

CARTMAN

SHIT-

CARTMAN

FUCK-

KYLE

This is sweet!!

STAN

Totally!

MR. GARRISON

Okay, children, let's try a few new math

problems. What is five times two?

MR. GARRISON

Come on, children, do be shy, just give

it your best shot.

MR. GARRISON

Yes, Clyde?

CLYDE

Twelve?

MR. GARRISON

Okay, now let's try to get an answer from

somebody who's not a complete retard.

Anyone? Come on don't be shy...

STAN

Hey, what are you doing?

SOLDIER

You can't wear these in school. It's

against school policy, thank you.

KYLE

What's that for?

SOLDIER 2

You get a star for doing well in school.

WENDY

NAZIS!!

STAN

What's the matter, Wendy?

WENDY

Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.

STAN

(To Kyle)

God damn it, why does she keep saying

that?

STAN

I'm so sick of these soldiers.

KYLE

Yeah, they suck.

CARTMAN

I know.  Always saying, do this, do that.

They think they're so cooool.

(To the soldier)

Acht lieben kraft auct shpiler!

(BZZZT)

OW!!!

CHEF

Hello there, children!!

STAN

Hey, Chef.

CHEF

How would like some Salisbury Steak with

buttered noodles?

KYLE

We can't, we're on a hunger strike.

CHEF

A hunger strike? For what?

STAN

To free Terrance and Phillip.

CARTMAN

But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.

STAN

Chef, do you know anything about women?

CHEF

Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?

KYLE

I don't know.

CHEF

Children, I know ALL there is to know

about women.

STAN

What's the secret to making a woman

happy?

CHEF

(Dishing out food)

Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the

clitoris.

STAN

Huh?

CHEF

Oops, I guess you haven't got that far

in your anatomy class, huh?

STAN

No, what does that mean, find the

clitoris?

CARTMAN

Is that like finding Jesus or something?

CHEF

Uh... Nothing. Forget I said anything.

Now move along, children! You're holding

up the line!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA (O.S.)

ATTENTION ALL SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY

STUDENTS AND STAFF! REPORT TO THE

GYMNASIUM IMMEDIATELY FOR A SPECIAL

ANNOUNCEMENT!!

STAN

Woa, I wonder what's going on, dude.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

Please take your seats, everyone!!!!

KYLE

What's going on, Chef?

CHEF

Something big, children.

NEWS ANCHOR

(Very serious)

This is a State of Emergency. We go now

to the White House for a VERY IMPORTANT

ANNOUNCEMENT from the President of the

United States.

PRESIDENT CLINTON

Ladies and gentlemen... At five a.m.

today, a day which will live in infamy...

sort of... the U.S. has declared war on

Canada.

CHEF

Oh, no...

MR. MACKEY

I don't believe it.

CARTMAN

Holy crap-

(BZZZT!)

OW!! Hey crap isn't a swear word, what

the fuck?!

(ZZZZZZTTT)

AGAGAGH!!!

PRESIDENT CLINTON

All Canadians are to leave the country

immediately, or be subject to military

camps. All Canadian products are to be

thrown out.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

How can they do this?

MR. GARRISON

I never thought there would be war again

in my lifetime...

PRESIDENT CLINTON

Do not be afraid of this war. Instead

embrace it. We have God on our side. And

besides, they're just Canadians, what the

hell are they gonna do?

STAN

Chef, what does it mean that we're at

war?

CHEF

It's... It's not good children.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

What do we do? Do we go on as normal

or...?

MR. GARRISON

I don't know Principal Victoria... I

don't know...

PRESIDENT

And now, I would like to bring up the

woman who led, and is still leading the

way in this glorious stand-

KYLE

(Pointing to TV)

HOLY SHIT DUDE!!

PRESIDENT

Mrs. Sheila Brovlofski.

CHEF

Isn't that your mother, Kyle?

KYLE'S MOTHER

My fellow Americans. I have led this

fight in the War against profanity. I

have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our

neighbor to the north has abused us for

the last time.

PRESIDENT

As Commander in chief, I have ordered our

Army to set up defensive positions along

the US-Canada border in anticipation of

an attack.

KYLE'S MOTHER

What about air strikes?

PRESIDENT

Huh?

KYLE'S MOTHER

We have to have air strikes on their

military and entertainment centers.  It's

the only way to ensure that their smut

can't reach American soil!

PRESIDENT

Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes

are necessary.

KYLE'S MOTHER

Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I

remind you that our country's heart and

soul are at stake, and our children's

minds are the battlefield!

The bastard Canadians want to fight us

because we won't tolerate their potty

mouths. Well, if it is war they want...

THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!

CHEF

Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle.

CARTMAN

Amen to that.

KENNY

Mph rmph rm rmph rm?

GEORGE BURNS

Snacky Smores? Why the hell would I have

proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores?

Beat it, kid.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

You just get cranky when you're tired,

that's all.  I told you that you

shouldn't have tried to carry that futon

all by yourself.

SATAN

I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not

too big to carry myself-

TV

In war news, countries from Europe and

Asia are joining sides in the Canadian-

American War-

SADDAM HUSSEIN

-Listen butterbuns, let's make love and

forget about the whole thing-

SATAN

SHHH!!!!

TV

...The death count is already on its way

to 10 million with no signs of slowing

down.  What started as a spat between the

United States and Canada is quickly

turning into World War III-

SATAN

It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen

are drawing nigh!  The time of the

prophecy is upon us!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Oh I love when you get all biblical

Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my

crank!

SATAN

No I'm being serious! Those Canadian

entertainers are to be killed. It is the

seventh sign.

SATAN

Behold, the signs of my reign on earth

are all falling into place!  The fall of

an empire-

SATAN

-The coming of a comet-

SATAN

Jerry Springer's movie doing more than

ten million box office-

SATAN

....And now....

SATAN

The seventh sign!  When the blood of

these Canadians touches American soil...

It will be my time to rise!!!!!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!

SATAN

Do you always think about sex?  I'm

talking about some very important stuff

here!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Listen buttercup, let's make love and

forget about the whole thing.

SATAN

Is sex the only thing that matters to

you?

SADDAM HUSSEIN

I love you.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

You know I do.

SATAN

I know.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

So what do you say we shut off that light

and get close, huh?

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch?

KYLE

Does it say what the clitoris is?

STAN

All it says is that it's above the

vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?

KYLE

Isn't that in Arizona or something?

STAN

What is this?

CARTMAN

They're burning all the Canadian stuff

cause of the war.

STAN

That book wasn't Canadian!

KYLE

Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip

anymore?

CLYDE

Of course not! We're at war! My daddy

says I HATE Canadians now!

MAC MOTHER

THAT'S IT! BURN EVERYTHING CANADIAN!!!

MAKE OUR COUNTRY DECENT AGAIN FOR OUR

CHILDREN!!!

CARTMAN

NNOOOO!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! OH, WHY

GOD, WHY?!

CARTMAN

This is all cause of your mom, Kyle.

She's such a bitch-

(BBBZAATT!!)

AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.

KYLE

And she's getting worse...

STAN

Dude... Isn't that your brother?

FIFTH GRADER

Why don't you go back to your own

country, CANADIAN!

FIFTH GRADER 2

Yeah, go eat some potatoes and ride

donkeys!

IKE

Eee todo ba!

KYLE

Hey! Leave him alone!

FIFTH GRADER

It's just a smelly Canadian. They're like

rats.

KYLE

He's my brother!

FIFTH GRADER

You don't look Canadian.

KYLE

He's adopted!

FIFTH GRADER

Well you better get his beady eyed

Canadian ass out of America before my

daddy finds him!!

KYLE

It's only a matter of time before my mom

has HIM burned too!

STAN

What has the world come to? This is

horrible. We're locked up, burning books,

hating other people-

CARTMAN

-no Cheesy Poofs.

STAN

-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is

happening?

KYLE

I don't know. But it has gone far enough!

I'm sick of it!

(Singing)

Something must be done!

Change has got to come around!

They're taking all our laughter

and burning it to the ground!

Can't you see what this is leading

to?

A world of chains and ties and

glue!

We have to fight before they've

taken every one!

Something must be done!

STAN

I agree! The only way to save our future

is to unite and fight!

(Singing)

Something must be done!

We must take action fast!

My parents have gotten so strict

they forgot they were children in

the past!

CARTMAN

And my mom has become so bu-sy

that she's raising heck and

ignoring me

I agree that there is now a battle

to be won!

Something must be done!

STAN

But what are we going to do against this

entire army?

KYLE

We've gotta get the word out. We'll get

on my dad's computer and use the

internet! Come on you guys!

BOYS

Something must be done!

Something's gotta give!

This world has become a bitch in

which

we have no desire to live!

BOYS

We've pushed it to the edge

And now the time has come!

Something's gotta change!

Something must be done!

Something must be done!!!

KYLE

Okay... I just need to find a few private

message boards...

STAN

Wait! Before we put a message out, do a

search on the word 'clitoris'.

KYLE

Okay...

KYLE

(Reading the screen)

"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word

Clitoris"!

STAN

Wow!

KYLE

I'll just try the first one.

KYLE

Dude! It's a lady giving a blow job to a

horse!

STAN

Is it Cartman's mom?

CARTMAN

Very funny!

KYLE

Hey... It IS Cartman's mom!!

CARTMAN

Oh, son of a bitch!

(ZZAP!!)

AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!

STAN

Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!

IKE

Ber dada!

KYLE

Get out of here Ike, you're too young for

this stuff!

IKE

Papa mama simi.

CARTMAN

Come on, just get to the message board!

KYLE

I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian

server... I've got to break into the main

frame...

KYLE

Damn it! They've got an access code! I'll

try to reroute the encryptions...

STAN

Dude, do you know what you're doing?

KYLE

No, dude, all you have to do is hit the

keys really fast and say a bunch of

stupid shit and it works.

KYLE

Bingo. Okay, here we go...

(Typing)

Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet

us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn

tomorrow night...

CARTMAN

Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.

KYLE

We're not gonna have pie and punch!

CARTMAN

More people will come if they think

there'll be pie and punch!

KYLE

(Typing)

pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The

password is...

STAN

(Dramatically)

La Resistance.

KYLE

You stay up here in the attic, Ike.

Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?

IKE

Uhh...

KYLE

Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Sir! The Canadians have destroyed Des

Moines!!

PRESIDENT

How can you tell?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Good one, sir!

PENTAGON GUY

Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing

into Canadian computers! It looks like we

may have a resistance movement

starting...

PRESIDENT

(Showing her the papers)

Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance...

It's probably Canadian spies!!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Well find out where that signal is coming

from!  Then hunt them down like dogs!

Any and all Canadian influence must be

stopped at all cost!

PRESIDENT

Yes ma'am!

KYLE'S MOTHER

And Bill?

PRESIDENT

KYLE'S MOTHER

I'm needing lunch.

PRESIDENT

Right away, ma'am!

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And so the draft will begin tomorrow, as

more and more troops are needed to fight

the Canadian forces...

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

What is quickly being referred to as 'The

Great Canadian-American War' has already

reached a death toll of two million.

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Goodnight, honey.

CARTMAN

Mom... When is the war gonna be over?

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You

want it to end quickly, huh?

CARTMAN

Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz

all my favorite TV shows have been

replaced by news and it's pissing me off.

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Oh.

CARTMAN

Mom...

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Yes, hon?

CARTMAN

If you went down on a horse... You'd tell

me, right?

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Sure, hon. Goodnight.

CARTMAN

Go away, scary noise.

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Eric?! Eric, what is it?!

CARTMAN

I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Oh you poor dear. You've been through so

much...

CARTMAN

I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire

and now he's all pissed off!!

(BZZTZT!)

AGH! I can't say pissed off?!

(BAZZTZT!!)

AGH!!

SATAN

The execution of Terrance and Phillip is

imminent, soon all hell shall rise!!

SATAN

(Evil and scary)

Are you afraid, little one? Afraid for

the souls of your pitiful friends that-

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Hey Satan!  I got some great new home

furnishings today!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Boy buddy Rich, it was a bitch to get

something to match with that bathroom

tile!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Oh, hey kid. Find those proofs of

purchases yet? No?! Gee, whatta surprise!

Well, keep lookin!

SATAN

Do you wanna know what

I

did today?

SADDAM HUSSEIN

What did you do today Satan?

SATAN

You don't care.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon

thing has got you all stressed out. Let's

make love.

SATAN

Do you remember when you first got here?

We used to talk all night long. Until the

sun came up... We would just lie in bed

and TALK.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

That's because I wanted to fuck you,

dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those

pants down!

SATAN

Don't call me dumb!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!

SATAN

How come you always want to make love to

me from behind? Is it because you want to

pretend I'm somebody else?

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who

am I gonna pretend you are? Helen Reddy?

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Come on, kid. Help me with these shower

curtains.

SATAN

(Gently)

Sometimes I think

When I look up real high

That there's a whole world up there

And just maybe it could be mine

But then, I sink

because it's here I'm supposed to

stay

but I don't even know how or why

its supposed to be that way-

SATAN

Up there, there is so much room

Where babies burp and flowers bloom

Everyone dreams I can dream too

Up there, Up where

The skies are ocean blue

I could be safe and live without a

care... Up there

SATAN

They say I don't belong

That my place is down below

Because of my beliefs I'm supposed

to stay where evil is sewn

But what is evil anyway?

Is there reason to the rhyme?

Without evil there could be no good

So it must be good to be evil

sometimes

Up there, there is so much room

Where babies burp and flowers bloom.

Everyone dreams I can dream too

Up there, Up where

The skies are ocean blue

I could be safe and life without a

care... Up there

KYLE

You're late, Cartman!

CARTMAN

I had to ride my bike here. My behind is

killing me.

KYLE

Your behind?

CARTMAN

I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if

I say 'ass-

(BBZZAATT)

OW!!!

KYLE

Did you bring the pie and punch?

CARTMAN

No you guys... Something happened... You

guys wanna hear something creepy?

(Looking over each shoulder)

I don't think Kenny is dead.

STAN

What?

CARTMAN

I saw him last night!

KYLE

I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny

every day.

CARTMAN

YOU DO?!

KYLE

Sure, dude.  On the face of every child,

on the smile of every baby...

CARTMAN

Hey!  I'm telling you this WAS Kenny! I

think he's haunting me.

KYLE

Somebody's here...

KYLE

Who is it?

VOICE

Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.

KYLE

What's the password?

VOICE

Uhh... I don't know.

KYLE

Guess.

VOICE

Uhh... Bacon.

KYLE

Okay.

GREGORY

Viva la Resistance.

STAN

Oh no, it's that kid.

GREGORY

This is the place--

STAN

Wendy?

WENDY

Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?

GREGORY

Well, apparently you have a bigger heart

than we thought. Let us get this meeting

underway, there are others coming.

STAN

Everyone be seated, please.

KYLE

Wow, a lot of people showed up.

STAN

Yeah, so what do we say?

KYLE

I thought you had something planned.

STAN

Me?!

STAN

(Nervous)

Kay. Uh... Terrance and Phillip are

supposed to be killed, and we think that

sucks ass!!

STAN

Uhh... So we think we should prank call a

bunch of policemen! We can have pizzas

sent to them that they didn't order! VIVA

LA RESISTANCE!!!

STAN

Uhh...

GREGORY

May I?

STAN

What?

GREGORY

Terrance and Phillip are currently being

held at a Canadian Internment camp two

kilometers outside of town.

They are to be executed tomorrow during a

star-studded USO show for the troops.

GREGORY

We must sneak into the camp through this

duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip

inside... The war is escalating, and the

American forces are preparing for a large

scale attack on Canada. That means the

time is now...

KYLE

Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.

GREGORY

This is a dangerous mission, so I'll go

myself.

STAN

No!

STAN

WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to

save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!

GREGORY

This will be very dangerous... Are you

quite sure?

CARTMAN

Fuck that!

(BZZT)

AGAGH!!

STAN

We're going... Let's run through the

plan!!

JIMBO

Oh, I'm so glad there's a war again. I

was gettin' worried I'd never see another

one!

NED

I know what you mean.

JIMBO

And they're giving all us troops a big

USO tomorrow with celebrities and

executions!

MR. GARRISON

You look great in your new uniform Mr.

Hat.

MR. HAT

You do too, Mr. Garrison.

MR. GARRISON

Boy, I can't wait for our first shore-

leave so I can go get me some poontang.

GENERAL PLYMKIN

PAY ATTENTION!

GENERAL PLYMKIN

It's no secret that the Evil Canadian

Federation has scored major victories all

over the United State.  We have brought

you here because you ar America's best,

and last hope.

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Oh... Apparently you're not the best,

you're simply the last. Anyway, let's

strategize... Map!

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Our sources have told us that the

Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's

USO show and stop us from executing

Terrance and Phillip.

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Now each battalion has a specific code-

name and mission.  Battalion 5, raise

your hands-

GENERAL PLYMKIN

You will be the all-important first

defense wave, which we will call

'Operation Human Shield'.

CHEF

Hey, wait a minute...

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human

Shield' will suffer heavy losses.  But

don't lose your spirit men!  Stay until

the bitter end.  Battalion 14?

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The

Darkies'.  You will follow Battalion 5

here-

GENERAL PLYMKIN

-and try not to get killed for God's

Sake.  Are there any questions men?

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Yes soldier?

CHEF

Have you ever heard of the Emancipation

Proclamation?

GENERAL PLYMKIN

I don't listen to hip-hop.

GENERAL PLYMKIN

If you somehow live, we will regroup on

this hill outside--

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Now what's wrong with this thing?

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Fucking windows 98!

GENERAL PLYMKIN

GET GATES IN HERE!!!

GENERAL PLYMKIN

YOU TOLD US WINDOWS 98 WOULD BE FASTER

AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH BETTER ACCESS TO

THE INTERNET!!!

BILL GATES

It is faster, over five million--

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Alright men, get lots of rest, and

prepare thyselves for battle!

GREGORY

...after you clear this zone here,

rendezvous behind this ridge where

Terrance and Phillip should be held.

KYLE

Gotcha.

GREGORY

You are indeed brave, but you will need

someone who's done this sort of thing

before.  MOLE!

VOICE

Oui?

GREGORY

Thank you for coming, Mole.

THE MOLE

So... We must free more Canadian

prizoners?

KYLE

Yeah, I guess.

THE MOLE

America... She iz a beetch that sheets on

her own children.

GREGORY

This is the Mole.  He will accompany you

to the prison where Terrance and Phillip

are.  He is an expert in covert

operations and a lifelong fighter for

freedom.

THE MOLE

Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured

down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want

this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine.

GREGORY

Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy

is... kept safe?

KYLE

Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me

death!!!

OTHERS

YEA!!!

GREGORY

God has smiled upon you this day

The fate of a nation in your

hands...

GREGORY

As brothers and sisters we unite

And behind you we shall fight!

Until only the most righteous

belief stands!

GREGORY

Do you see the distant flames?

they bellow in the night

Fight in all our names

For what we know is right

And if you all get shot and cannot

carry on

Though you die, La Resistance

lives on!

KYLE

What? Shot?

KIDS

You might get stabbed in the head

by a dagger or a sword

You might be burned to death

or skinned alive or worse!

GREGORY

But when they torture you

You will not feel a need to run

For though you die, La Resistance

Lives on!

KIDS

Do you hear the beating drum?

It is our hearts all joined to one

It is the music of our souls

knowing we have much to overcome!

CUT TO:

KYLE'S MOTHER

Something must be done!

Tomorrow it will be!

We're going to execute this threat

to our democracy!

M.A.C. MOTHERS

And after that our kids will be

safe from all the Canadian scum!

The time is now the time is here

Tomorrow something will be done!

CUT TO:

SATAN

I want to be part of that world!

But if only I had the strength to

go without HIM...

If only I had the strength to leave

him behind...

Get on with my life in that

world...

Start over as part of that world...

CUT TO:

SOLDIERS

Tomorrow we face our destiny!

Tomorrow we fight to keep our

country free!

Death to Canada! Death to them all!

Like our forefathers we shall

answer the call!

CHEF

(Stroking woman's arm)

Baby your thighs sparkle like

diamonds

Baby your butt is tender like the

night

I can see by the look in your pants

that you want to treat me right.

I'll whisper sweet nothings in your

cleavage

And you can kiss me gently with

your tongue

And I'll make love to you so deeply

That you'll feel pressure clear up

to your lungs.

SOLDIERS

Something must be done!

Something's gotta give!

Tomorrow we will be free or we will no

longer live!

CUT TO:

TERRANCE & PHILLIP

Shut your fucking face Unclefucka!

You're an ass raping cock sucking

YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!!

TERRANCE

Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.

PHILLIP

shitstorm we've found ourselves in this

time.

KYLE'S MOM

It is my pleasure to present to you, THE

EXECUTION OF TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!!

KYLE'S MOM

KYLE'S MOM

Today is a great day for democracy!

GENERAL PLYMKIN

GENERAL PLYMKIN

We have just captured some Canadian

Sympathizers!

KYLE'S MOTHER

We will execute them along with Terrance

KYLE'S MOTHER

Kyle?!

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Eric?

KYLE

Hi, ma.

GENERAL PLYMKIN

We also have a Canadian SPY who was

hiding out in South Park!!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Ike?!

KYLE'S MOTHER

General... These are OUR CHILDREN!

GENERAL PLYMKIN

They are Canadian sympathizers and they

must be dealt with accordingly!

STAN'S MOTHER

But they're CHILDREN!

CARTMAN

Dude! Terrance and Phillip! Wow! Can I

get your autographs?!

TERRANCE

Sure, tubby, just as soon as we're

killed.

KENNY'S MOTHER

We can't kill these kids!

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Listen mothers, YOU'RE the ones that

started all this. Don't get all emotional

NOW!

STAN'S MOTHER

But we're doing all this to help our

children's futures!

CARTMAN'S MOTHER

Yes, I think shooting our children would

adversely affect their futures.

KYLE'S MOTHER

No... The General is right.

KYLE

MOM!!!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Boobie... This is the only way you're

ever going to learn. I have an

opportunity here to teach you about

consequences.

STAN'S MOTHER

Sheila, you're going to far! Those are

YOUR children!

KYLE'S MOTHER

YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO

BE RUINED BY SMUT!!

BIG THING

I am the clitoris.

STAN

The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE

CLITORIS!!

BIG THING

Stan, your friends need you. They are in

trouble and you must help them.

STAN

Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to

get Wendy to like me.

BIG THING

There are more important matters right

now...

STAN

NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR

YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO

GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!

BIG THING

Dude, she's eight years old, just get her

some ice cream or something.

STAN

Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!

BIG THING

Now go, your friends are in danger... The

USO show is a mile east of here, just

over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.

WENDY

Stan! Stan are you okay?!

STAN

Wendy?

GREGORY

I see you failed in your mission.

Terrance and Phillip must be dead by now.

WENDY

Come on Stan, we have to hurry. The

Canadian forces are about to attack!!

GENERAL PLYMKIN

Throw the switch!!!

KYLE'S MOTHER

STAN'S MOTHER

My God... This is terrible...

KYLE'S MOTHER

This is what we wanted! We wanted our

children to be brought up in a smut-free

environment!!!

KENNY'S MOTHER

But we didn't want THIS. I just followed

you 'cause I made a shitload of money

selling Kenny t-shirts!

STAN'S MOTHER

Oh Lord, what have we done...?

KYLE'S MOTHER

Wake up, people!  We all have to do

things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's

the not pretty things that make life

worth fighting the not pretty things for!

Why do you think children have to be born

in hospitals?

KYLE'S MOTHER

Why does it matter?! My plan is a perfect

plan!!  Perfect!  Perfect! Perfect!!!!!

KYLE'S MOTHER

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the

not pretty things from letting our

children be born in hospitals!

STAN'S MOTHER

We're going to find our boys! For God's

sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Killed.  They should only be so lucky.

Kyle wasn't even BORN in a hospital!

PHILLIP

Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!

TERRANCE

You did? Just now?

PHILLIP

Come on, we can take shelter in one of

those buildings!

KYLE'S MOTHER

TERRANCE

AGH!

PHILLIP

Terrance! NO!

KYLE'S MOTHER

SATAN

RAAGHGH!!!! MY TIME HAS COME!!!

CARTMAN

big dumb Jew... I didn't mean it. You're

not a Jew.

KYLE

Yes I am!

IKE

Baba mama!

CARTMAN

AGH!

(Noticing Mr. Hat in his hand)

What the hell am I still holding this

MR. GARRISON

Mr. Hat! Noooooo!

KYLE

STAN

Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can

KYLE

CARTMAN

(Sarcastic)

Oh, that's swell, Stan. I guess all's

well that ends well, huh? We can go home

now. There's just one little thing left

to tie up... WORLD WAR THREE!!!

CARTMAN/KYLE

AGAGAH!!!

CARTMAN

It's him! I told you!! Kenny's come to

take us to the netherworld!

KENNY

KYLE

Wait! He's not haunting us, he's trying

to tell us something!

KENNY

Mph rmph rm rmph rm!

CARTMAN

Okay!  We can get you some proofs of

purchases for Snacky Smores Kenny!  Just

mellow the heck out!

DOCTOR GAUCHE

Hey, pal, don't lose your head.

CANADIAN SOLDIER

I'm glad you got that off your chest.

TOM

I guess he got the point.

CANADIAN SOLDIER 2

Plastics are a cheap and efficient

insulator for electrical applications.

SATAN

Yes! Good! Fight and kill one another!

SATAN

You're all part of Satan's army now!

KYLE'S MOTHER

What the hell is going on?!

SATAN

I am the dark master!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I

don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!

SATAN

SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Oh.

SATAN

YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE

INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME...

NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF

DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!

CHEF

Oh, good job, Mrs. Broflofski, thanks a

lot.

KYLE'S MOTHER

I... I was just trying to make the world

a better place for children...

SATAN

Yes... And in doing so, you brought

enough anger and intolerance to the world

to allow my coming.

KYLE'S MOTHER

And I thought my mother was the master of

guilt.  Geez Louise.

SATAN

SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO

ME!!!

KYLE'S MOTHER

Oh God... What have I done...

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Hey, I'm missing the party!

SATAN

No! It can't be!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Did you miss me, buttercup?

(Yelling out)

All right, gang! I am your new ruler now!

Everyone bow down to ME!!

KYLE

HOLD EVERYTHING!!!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Oh, it's the bratty kid from hell.

KYLE

You made a deal with Kenny that if he got

ten proofs of purchases from Snacky

Smores you'd grant him any wish.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

And?

SATAN

I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking

with him!

KYLE

What?

SADDAM HUSSEIN

The deal's off, go away, guy.

SATAN

No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't

just renege on a deal. That's lying.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not

hear okay?

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Now, let's start torturing people, shall

we? We'll start with...

(Looks at Cartman)

THIS little fat kid first!!

CARTMAN

AY!  Don't call me fat, buttfucker-

STAN

Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!

CARTMAN

How the fuck should I know!!

KYLE

Look at that!

CHEF

It's that v-chip thing that's inside you,

Eric!  The polarity must have been

reversed by the electric chair!

TERRANCE

Oh boy!

CARTMAN

BUTTFUCKING SHIT!

CARTMAN

SADDAM HUSSEIN

CARTMAN

SATAN

Help you? You've destroyed my life and

now you want me to help you?!  You're

always making me feel like a piece of

shit.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Come on guy, you know I only rib you

because I love you so much!

SATAN

If you love somebody then you treat them

with respect!  You've never respected me!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Can we talk about this later?  Everyone

is watching!

SATAN

I don't care!  I want to talk about it

now!

SATAN

Ow, you're hurting me!

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Listen guy, you're embarassing me in

front of my friends!  You know how I get

mad when I get embarassed.

SADDAM HUSSEIN

Your little problems can wait til later,

SADDAM HUSSEIN

SATAN

SADDAM HUSSEIN

NOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo!!!!! Heeeeyyyy

CHEF

Saddam Hussein is dead!

STAN AND KYLE

Hooray!!!

PHILLIP

You're quite a purveyor of filth, little

boy!

TERRANCE

Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of

words!

CARTMAN

Well, I learned it all from you guys.

PHILLIP

Of course you did, cock fuck!

SATAN

He spent so much time convincing me I was

weak and stupid that I believed it

myself.

SATAN

Saddam didn't respect me.  All he wanted

was sex.  But it took me so long to

figure that out.

CHEF

Here you go Satan-

SATAN

Thank you. Give me the proofs of

purchases.

SATAN

Okay Kenny, I will keep the bargain. Any

wish you want is yours.

KENNY

Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm.

KYLE

WHAT?

STAN

Are you sure, Kenny?

SATAN

What did he say?

STAN

He said that his wish is for everyone who

died in the war to come back.

CHEF

Kenny, you realize this wish is the only

chance for YOU not to be dead...

KENNY

M mprh. Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm.

Mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm.

SATAN

Very well, then. I will put an end to the

war as your wish and make everything as

it was before the war started. But you

Kenny, must remain dead.

KENNY

Mph rm.

SATAN

I must admit, I'm kind of relieved. It's

too fucking cold up here.

STAN

Aren't there cold parts of hell?

SATAN

Yeah, but it's a real dry cold. Here it's

the humidity that gets me. I guess I'm

destined to live in hell... alone...

SATAN

Hello... What's this?

SATAN

Hi there, little guy... Would you like to

go to hell with me?

SATAN (AS MR. HAT)

Sure. I bet we can be best friends!

KYLE

Thank you, Kenny.

STAN

Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for

us. You're a real pal.

MR. GARRISON

I... I'm alive... Where's Mr. Hat?

BIG GAY AL

Wow... We were all killed and now we're

fine. That's super!

KYLE

Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.

STAN

Yeah, but you know, I learned something

today.  I learned that getting all worked

up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is

just stupid... You all focused so hard on

erasing profanity that you forgot the

most important thing... To love each

other.

CARTMAN

Yeah! You're all a bunch of stupid sons a

bitches!

STAN

Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going

to have fun with profanity just like you

and dad did when you were little.

KYLE

Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or

dicksucker or, or-

KYLE'S MOTHER

Shiteater-

STAN'S MOTHER

-Or monkey fucker-

WENDY

I'm sorry Stan, I guess you really DO get

it after all!

STAN

Wendy... How would you like to go get

some ice cream?

WENDY

Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice

cream?

STAN

My friend the clitoris told me.

WENDY

Wow, I have a clitoris too.

STAN

Really? Where the hell do you keep it?

It's huge.

STAN

But Wendy... What about Gregory?

WENDY

Stan, I never cared for Gregory.

STAN

You didn't?

WENDY

No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.

STAN

Cool!

WENDY

(Singing)

Thank my lucky stars

Here before me now

Is everything I'd ever hoped for-

STAN

Knew it in a word

Saw it in a glance

The only thing I think I'd die for

STAN AND WENDY

I can't stop now... My heart's

awake!

I pray your arms my arms to take!

So this is why I'm alive!

EVERYONE

SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE, UNCLEFUCKA!

YOU'RE A COCK SUCKING ASS RAPING

UNCLEFUCKA!

YOU'RE AN UNCLEFUCKA, YES IT'S

TRUE!

NOBODY FUCKS UNCLES QUITE LIKE YOU!

UNCLEFUCKAAA!!!

KENNY'S DAD

This is all so wonderful.  I just wish

our little Kenny could see all of this

joy.

KYLE

Oh he can, dude.  Look!

END.
