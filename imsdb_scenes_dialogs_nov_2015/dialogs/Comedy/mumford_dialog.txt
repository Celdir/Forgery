"MUMFORD"

Screenplay by

Lawrence Kasdan

SHOOTING DRAFT

FOLLETT (V.O.)

I get outta the truck in this two-

bit town. I got no money and no

prospects. What I need right now is

a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a

hot broad. I'll take 'em in any order

they come...

FOLLETT (V.O.)

...Oh yeah, one other thing I need --

an angle.

FOLLETT (V.O.)

I was thinking -- if it weren't for

bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck

at all...

LANDLADY (O.S.)

Can I help you?

FOLLETT (V.O.)

Either my luck had just changed, or

Fate just bought me another round of

trouble.

LANDLADY

...not very fancy... house needs

repairs... We haven't had a man around

here for so long...

FOLLETT (V.O.)

She kept yammerin' the whole time,

but her hips were doing all the

talking...

FOLLETT (V.O.)

It couldn't 'a been any clearer what

the set-up was. The next move was up

to me...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Don't tell me!

MUMFORD

(softer)

-- That's all the time we have.

Sorry...

(indicates his watch)

...next time.

FOLLETT

I have eighteen more minutes!

MUMFORD

I don't want to hear any more today.

FOLLETT

Why not?

MUMFORD

Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't

you?

FOLLETT

Well, I don't know... I only been

seeing you --

MUMFORD

Without trust, there's no point to

any of this. You might as well not

come.

FOLLETT

Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't

want to come --

MUMFORD

Good, then go.

LILY

You're early... it's not ready. What

happened?

MUMFORD

My patient had to leave early.

LILY

Who was that?

MUMFORD

Does the phrase "nosy" have any

meaning to you, Lily?

LILY

I think it's like... inquisitive.

MUMFORD

It was Henry Follett.

LILY

(reacts)

Man, you see him a lot. And it's

very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll

be saying what his problem is.

MUMFORD

What do you want to know?

LILY

You're terrible. I'm never telling

you anything.

PATRON

Hey, Doc... how's it going?

MUMFORD

Fine, Vincent... how's yourself?

LILY

How long you been in this town?

MUMFORD

Oh, I don't know...

LILY

Four months, two and a half weeks --

that's how long.

(Mumford gives her a

look)

And you've already got more patients

than those other two shrinks combined.

MUMFORD

Lily, I don't think even you could

know that --

LILY

Look at that guy...

LILY

You know who that is, don't you?

(Mumford does not)

You really don't? That's Skip

Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit

by a truck, this whole town shuts

down.

MUMFORD

Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.

LILY

So, what makes you so popular? What's

your secret?

MUMFORD

(takes his bag to go)

You like me. How come?

LILY

Not sure. Let me think about it.

LIONEL

That's the new psychiatrist?

LILY

Psychologist. He's not medical.

LIONEL

Probably thinks he's pretty smart.

NESSA

...so he already had the tattoo that

said, "Naomi Forever"... and now

they're broken up, see, and he has

to have it removed. But while the

scar is still healing, or whatever

you call it when you have a tattoo

removed, he meets Chandra. And it's

serious, immediate love. So in no

time, he's gone from the most gorgeous

model in the world to the most

gorgeous actress in North America.

MUMFORD

What do you mean, "in no time"?

NESSA

In maybe three or four issues.

MUMFORD

Weekly or monthly?

NESSA

Monthly! God, how shallow do you

think Brad is? Why do I waste my

time telling you this stuff?

MUMFORD

Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?

NESSA

Don't do that thing...

(Mumford: what?)

...that shrink thing.

MUMFORD

It's a big part of the show.

NESSA

You really need to let people smoke

in here, you know. It's perverse.

What are they paying you to see me?

NESSA

The school board doesn't pay you?

What kind of deal is that?

MUMFORD

It's called pro bono.

NESSA

Pro boner?

(he waits her out)

Pro bono, huh? For whose good,

supposedly?

MUMFORD

It's my bit for the community.

NESSA

Fuck the community.

(he won't go for it)

There was this article my friends

and I read. It was "25 Signs He's

Great in Bed". It was very

fascinating.

MUMFORD

Where was this?

NESSA

Where?... The New York Times. The

first one was -- "he handles produce

well." Which we already knew!

(an expression she

uses)

The point is, you have a lot of the

signs.

MUMFORD

You been spying on me in the

supermarket, Nessa?

NESSA

Have women found you attractive?

NESSA

I knew you wouldn't answer. I've

been thinking about what you said

last time. How me trying to lose

weight -- and constantly not -- is

like a lot of people with addictions.

How maybe I can't lose the weight,

ever...

(quietly)

Which we already knew...

MUMFORD

That's not quite what I said --

NESSA

It's a really weird thing for a shrink

to say... and then you said maybe

people'd be happier if they'd accept

that some things don't change --

that it'd be some kind of a relief

or something...

NESSA

Well, I guess I'm just a dumb bitch,

but how depressing is that moment --

the moment when you give up?

SKIP

Hi.

SKIP

You're Doc Mumford.

(Mumford nods)

Skip Skipperton.

MUMFORD

How are you?

SKIP

Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been

hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot

about you.

SKIP

Do you think we could...? Can I buy

you a drink?

CUT TO:

SKIP

..."Find the need and fill it" my

dad used to say -- I guess a lot of

dads say that -- but I did and it

just took off.

MUMFORD

No kidding... Panda. Where'd that

come from?

SKIP

Panda? I've always liked giant

pandas... I've been to China and

seen them in the wild. That's the

kind of thing I can do if I want...

now. I can do pretty much anything I

want to do these days.

SKIP

So now we make 23% of the modems in

the market, which is pretty good.

SKIP

When I was growing up here, the town

was about dead. The timber business

was played out... Panda changed all

that. Now, just about everybody in

town either works for the company or

depends on it somehow. Which is kinda

the problem...

SKIP

Would you like another beer?

MUMFORD

Nah... scotch.

SKIP

(brightens, like a

kid)

Far out. Single malt?

(gets up)

Can I pick it?

DISSOLVE TO:

MUMFORD

You want me... to be... your friend.

MUMFORD

But that's not what's really going

on...

(Skip is excited)

...What's really going on is... you

have some problems and you want some

therapy, but you feel it could be

very bad for Panda Modem stock if

word got out that you were having

head problems.

MUMFORD

Can I ask you a personal question?

SKIP

Of course! That's exactly what I

want.

MUMFORD

Have you thought about getting a

wife?

SKIP

When Panda started to happen, I was

dating women from New York, San

Francisco, L.A. They came out of the

woodwork. Models, actresses, venture

capitalists... These were not the

kind of girls who were interested in

me before I hit it... And you know

what I discovered? I discovered these

girls did not love me for myself.

The majority of them didn't even

like me. But a lot of them would've

gladly become Mrs. Skipperton for a

while. Can you imagine that --

marrying someone just because they've

got money?

SKIP

I gotta pee.

(he gets up, a little

wobbly)

Can I ask you something? This town

is called Mumford... Been that way

since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...

(finally remembers)

...thirteen! Right?

(Mumford: if you say

so)

Now here's the question -- Your name

is Mumford, too.

MUMFORD

Is that the question?

SKIP

You moved here from back East and

your name is the same as this town.

Is that right?

(Mumford shrugs)

Far out.

SKIP

I hope you don't think I want you to

do this for free. Just because we're

gonna play it like we're friends,

doesn't mean I won't pay you like a

doctor.

MUMFORD

I understand.

SKIP

I have a lot of money. Do you know

how much money I've got?

MUMFORD

Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going

to tell you what I've got.

SKIP

I've got three big ones.

MUMFORD

I'm impressed. I couldn't make three

million dollars if I lived three

lifetimes.

SKIP

No, no... I have three billion

dollars.

LIONEL

...so I'm watching Brokaw and they've

got some astronomer, this little

limey know-it-all, and he's telling

how, with this Himball telescope,

they've discovered there are maybe

400 million more galaxies than they

thought there were. And I guess that's

supposed to make me feel small? I'm

supposed to feel insignificant? Is

that the point? Because I can tell

you it didn't.

MUMFORD

Lionel, since this is our first

session together, maybe --

MUMFORD

-- you can sit up and look at me if

you'd like --

(Lionel waves that

off and looks away)

-- maybe it would be helpful if you

told me a little about what brought

you here.

LIONEL

Kind of impatient for a big-time

headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout

you let me explain it my own way...

LIONEL

...and in the dream, it's always the

same, I wake up in my room from when

I was I kid in Ohio, and I realize

this is the day of the big exam at

school...

LIONEL

...which is no problem for me, because

I remembered it was coming and I've

attended every class, so I'm totally

prepared. Then I see myself running

down the hall at school...

LIONEL (V.O.)

...but it's not really my school --

and this is very interesting -- it's

the school from the next district --

MUMFORD (V.O.)

-- Go on!

LIONEL (V.O.)

And even though I arrive a little

bit early, everybody's already there.

But the surprising part is --

LIONEL (V.O.)

-- I'm the only one who's prepared!

CUT TO:

LIONEL

-- you crazy? You can't do this!

MUMFORD

Sure I can, Lionel.

LIONEL

I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I

like my clients? I can't stand most

of them! But I don't kick them out...

MUMFORD

See that sign -- We retain the right

to refuse service to anyone. I'm not

going to charge you for this session,

but I don't want to see you back

here.

LIONEL

Don't you at least have a back door

I can use?

MUMFORD

Come out this way. There's no shame

in getting a little therapy... is

there, Althea?

ALTHEA

Not at all. It takes guts, Lionel.

LIONEL

Maybe some of us don't need this

crap!

MUMFORD

And it's the Hubble Telescope, not

the Himball Telescope.

MUMFORD

Jeez... what an asshole.

ALTHEA

What do they want from me?

(more sobbing)

What have I done that's so wrong?

(pulling it together)

They act as though they don't have

their own peculiar things... They

do! Believe me. Everybody's got

something...

(looks at Mumford)

Even you probably have things.

MUMFORD

Me more than most.

ALTHEA

Why are they ganging up against me?

MUMFORD

I'm not sure. But I think they're

worried about you.

ALTHEA

It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy.

He had nothing to do with this --

except pay, of course. He's always

willing to pay. He's extremely

generous.

(a long beat)

I'm so humiliated that my own children

would threaten me.

MUMFORD

How did they threaten you?

ALTHEA

They said if I didn't get help, they

wouldn't deal with me any more.

(a beseeching look)

What do you think about that?

MUMFORD

Good kids.

ALTHEA

Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.

MUMFORD

Hmm?

ALTHEA

I said... you must come out to the

house for dinner on Thursday.

MUMFORD

Really? You think so?

ALTHEA

Yes. Jeremy will be home for the

weekend. And you can meet the kids.

MUMFORD

How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.

LILY

Doc.

(doesn't look up)

Ainge...

COOK

Dr. Mumford.

MUMFORD

(doesn't really know

him)

Mr. Cook.

COOK

Could you come with me please?

COOK

I know I shoulda come to your office.

I was gonna, actually, but then when

you walked in here today...

MUMFORD

Uh-huh.

COOK

It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta

problem.

MUMFORD

What's that?

COOK

We're not sure. She's been to all

kinds of doctors in the city and

they've said different things. Some

of 'em are callin' it --

(wants to get this

right)

-- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest

are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue

Symptom...

MUMFORD

Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

COOK

That's it -- syndrome. So you know

all about it?

MUMFORD

No... a little. There's a lot of

debate about it.

COOK

Yeah, I got that. Some people think

it's all in their heads.

(more intense)

It's been so bad she's had to move

back here to Mumford and live with

us. And I'm not sure that's the best

thing, either...

MUMFORD

Why's that?

COOK

Oh... a lot of things. Several

different factors. Will you see her,

Doctor Mumford?

MUMFORD

Sure. Why don't you bring her up to

my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.

COOK

I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a

mood. Do you ever go to somebody's

house?

MUMFORD

Generally that doesn't work out so

well. It sends the wrong message to

people who need to make a change.

MUMFORD

Hello, Lionel.

LIONEL

You've got to have the right ladder

for the job. You don't know what

you're doing, you can get yourself

in trouble.

MUMFORD

You're right, as usual. See you.

LIONEL (O.S.)

...completely inappropriate and highly

unprofessional. Now I don't want to

presume to tell you how to run your

businesses --

SHEELER

-- practices.

LIONEL

-- Whatever. Six months ago, you two

were the only games in town. The

value of your...

(mocking)

..."practices" could be seriously

undermined by this bozo. A town this

size has only so many headcases to

go around.

DELBANCO

What exactly would you have us do,

Lionel?

LIONEL

Protect your turf! Check this guy

out. I smell a rat, I tell you.

SHEELER

Mr. Dillard, I'm sure Dr. Delbanco

shares my gratitude for your concern.

But I also know he'd agree that you

misunderstand the nature of our

calling to mental health. We're not

in some... widget business, trying

to crush our competition.

LIONEL

What the hell's a widget?

DELBANCO

What an asshole!

SHEELER

(agrees)

Ernest, what do you think?

DELBANCO

I think he's got a point.

SKIP

This is great!

SKIP

This is exactly what I wanted.

MUMFORD

Skip, you must have lots of people

you can throw a ball with.

SKIP

You'd be surprised. Most guys have

kids or wives or girlfriends. They're

busy. It's not as easy as you think.

MUMFORD

Skip, you're the head of the whole

deal here. Are they busier than you?

SKIP

Well, you know... that's the thing.

Like I said, just about everybody in

town works for me. And it's just not

the same asking someone to throw a

ball when they work for you. It's

like an order or something... And no

one -- no one -- asks me.

MUMFORD

So, would you say we're out here...

let me think how to put this... Is

your problem really that you're...

lonely?

SKIP

Don't you like this?

MUMFORD

Hell yes, I like it. What's better

than this? Most guys would kill just

to have someone do this with them

whenever they like.

SKIP

Okay then.

(SLAP... SLAP)

Have you got a lot of friends?

MUMFORD

("nope")

Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily,

runs the coffee shop?

SKIP

No... I've seen her. Good-looking

woman.

MUMFORD

(agrees)

She's probably ten years older than

you.

SKIP

(SLAP... SLAP)

Good-looking woman.

MUMFORD

Lives downstairs from me. She's got

a great dog named for Danny Ainge.

SKIP

(sparks to that)

Really? I'm the only person I know

that likes Danny Ainge, outside of

Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.

MUMFORD

Well, there's Lily.

SKIP

Did you know that Danny Ainge was

drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you

know what kind of athlete you have

to be to play in the NBA and in the

bigs?

MUMFORD

Amazing.

SKIP

Unbelievable...

(SLAP... SLAP)

...And Lily named her dog after him?

Far out.

MUMFORD

What kind of person do you have to

be to do this?

SKIP

What?

MUMFORD

This --

CUT TO:

SKIP

I would've traded any of it to have

made the Mumford High varsity.

SKIP

So I guess Henry Follett is a patient

of yours. He's my pharmacist.

MUMFORD

Yeah.

(SLAP... SLAP)

Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.

MUMFORD

Pretty good, too. Lots of detail.

Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned

ones, from back when people cared

about atmosphere and character.

SKIP

Uh-huh.

MUMFORD

Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot

better than his real one. Nothing

can live up to it. His wife got sick

of it and left him. Took his kids

with her.

SKIP

I wondered what happened to her...

MUMFORD

Of course, it's not that simple.

There's something powerful going on

there. We've got a lot of work to

do.

(announcer voice)

It's hit to the warning track!

MUMFORD

In these fantasies, Henry Follett is

played by a handsome guy with biceps.

Can you imagine that? Where your

self-esteem has to be?

(throws him the ball)

Man, I'd just like to move the guy

to the point where he gets to appear

in his own fantasies.

MUMFORD

Feel free to lie down. Most people

do.

SOFIE

I'd better not, I'll fall right to

sleep. I think it's too soon for me

to be sleeping with you.

MUMFORD

What can you tell me about this?

SOFIE

Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting

to tell you...

(tiny smile, to herself)

...about my exhaustion. I didn't

really want to come. I'm not hopeful

right now. But I couldn't take the

look on my dad's face. He's a truly

kind person, which is pretty

extraordinary if you knew the story.

He's the opposite of me, I guess --

all stamina and resolve.

MUMFORD

When did you start to feel this way?

SOFIE

About six months ago, I guess it is

now. God, it seems like years. What

a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before

this happened -- when I'd hear people

talk about this kind of thing -- I

thought it was a bunch of bullshit.

MUMFORD

What?

SOFIE

You think that now! You think it's a

bunch of hooey, don't you?

MUMFORD

(unconvincing)

No.

SOFIE

I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.

SOFIE

That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother

always says -- "Everything that's

wrong with you is in your head." I

suppose that's true.

MUMFORD

Back when this started, was there

anything unusual happening in your

life? A change of job, of living

situation... a loss of some kind?

SOFIE

No... but it started one year to the

day after my divorce became final.

That's not too suspicious, is it?...

But it wasn't like I was feeling bad

about the divorce. Just the opposite.

MUMFORD

Hmm.

SOFIE

Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?

MUMFORD

Hmm, as in -- that's interesting.

Sometimes, with enough clues, it's

possible to figure these things out.

SOFIE

Even if you don't think it's real?

MUMFORD

I don't know what's real and what

isn't. That's never been my strong

suit. But if you're tired all the

time and you've had to give up the

life you were having and come back

home when you didn't want to... that's

worth trying to fix. Maybe I can

help you do that.

SOFIE

What would you do?

MUMFORD

We... we would try several things.

But I need to see you a lot.

SOFIE

I don't know. I barely made it today.

MUMFORD

I'll come to you. We'll try a little

walking.

MUMFORD

We'll take it slow. You'll never

feel you can't handle it.

SOFIE

I don't think I can afford it. I

don't want my dad paying.

MUMFORD

We'll work it out.

SOFIE

You have the best answer for

everything.

(Mumford shrugs)

You seem so... hopeful. Are you always

this sunny?

MUMFORD

No one ever thought so. You must

bring it out.

SOFIE

Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone

agrees my immune system's way down.

MUMFORD

Maybe you'll catch it.

SOFIE

Can I ask you something?

(Mumford: of course)

Didn't you tell my dad you didn't

think it was a good idea to come to

the patient?

(he admits it)

So what changed?

ALTHEA

-- sorry everything's in such an

uproar. Lots of big occasions coming

up, and of course Christmas is only

eight months away --

(giggles uncontrollably)

-- I don't know what's keeping Jeremy.

You know he stays in the city three

nights a week -- I guess I explained

that...

(Mumford nods)

...I know Katie's here, but I'm not

so sure about Martin... I'm making

dinner myself tonight, so I'll have

to leave you, I'm afraid...

ALTHEA

I'm awful I know, but will you please

help yourself. I just got a new copper

sauciere from Williams-Sonoma and

I'm afraid it'll be the death of us

all if I don't get back in there...

KATIE (O.S.)

You're the doctor, aren't you?

MUMFORD

You must be Katie. People call me

Doc.

KATIE

(motioning urgently)

C'mere. Quick... c'mon!

KATIE

Cuddledown... Linen & Lace... Scully

& Scully... Smith & Hawken... Plow &

Hearth... Museum of Modern Art...

Smithsonian Museum... J. Crew...

Wolferman's... Hold Everything...

Nieman Marcus... Coldwater Creek...

Garnett Hill... Norm Thompson...

Victoria's Secret... Sharper Image...

Hammacher Schlemmer...

MARTIN

Is this him?

KATIE

(nods)

I showed him.

MARTIN

(to Mumford)

Do you get it now? This is no joke.

JEREMY

Hey, kids. Oh, hi.

JEREMY

You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford.

Jeremy Brockett.

MUMFORD

Doc. Nice to meet you.

JEREMY

Sorry I'm late... traffic was a

motherfucker. Have another drink,

I'll be back in five.

DISSOLVE TO:

ALTHEA

I'll be back.

JEREMY

I think you'll like this. Know much

about Cuban cigars?

MUMFORD

Nope.

JEREMY

Makes the whole thing that much

better.

JEREMY

Just hold the flame a little bit

below the end... that's it... now

just turn it slowly as you draw...

JEREMY

Are you a man who likes to treat

himself right?

MUMFORD

I've had my moments.

JEREMY

I am. And I'm not ashamed of it.

Nobody ever said on their death bed --

"I treated myself too well."

MUMFORD

I thought it was -- Nobody ever said,

"I should have spent more time at

the office."

JEREMY

Fill in the blank. I don't mind the

office. The point is, you only go

'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be

here now.

MUMFORD

What do you do?

JEREMY

Althea hasn't told you?

MUMFORD

(no)

We've been talking about her, mostly.

JEREMY

Well, in '85 four of us left our

firms and formed an investment banking

venture. We've got twenty-three people

working there now.

MUMFORD

You've done well.

JEREMY

We've done... very well. You know

anything about addiction, Doc?

MUMFORD

A little.

JEREMY

Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say

when you're in the red zone, you

gotta score.

(watches Mumford smoke)

So what do you think?

MUMFORD

Tastes good.

JEREMY

No... I mean about Althea. About

her...

(makes a face)

...behavior. Do you think you can

fix her up?

MUMFORD

What do you think's wrong with her?

JEREMY

She's gone weird is what's wrong

with her. Out of control. Probably

from living out here in Mayberry.

JEREMY

You're the doctor, what do you think?

MUMFORD

She seems very unhappy.

JEREMY

I think we all knew that, professor.

The question... the real --

(drawn out, stoned)

-- quest-tio-nee... is... why?

MARTIN

But you know how to drive?

MUMFORD

Sure.

MARTIN

Got a license?

(yes)

But no car?

MUMFORD

Don't need it.

MARTIN

I just got my license two weeks ago.

MUMFORD

You're good.

MARTIN

I been drivin' since I was twelve.

MUMFORD

That would explain it.

MARTIN

Can you help Mom?

MUMFORD

I'm trying.

MARTIN

(intense)

Got to.

MARTIN

Nessa Watkins... She comes to you,

doesn't she? You're treating her,

right?

MARTIN

What's wrong with her?

MUMFORD

Is she a friend of yours?

MARTIN

No... sort of. Man, she could be

cool, but all she does is get wrecked

and do all the guys. She's blowin'

them in the parking lot.

MARTIN

A person's got to hate themselves to

act like that.

MARTIN

Have you ever met a bigger shithead

than my stepfather?

LILY

Ainge!

MARTIN

That's okay. Jeremy won't mind. Good

dog.

LILY

Ainge!

LILY

(to Ainge)

Do we run into the street? No, I

didn't think so.

(looks after Martin)

Nice car. How's that place?

MUMFORD

It's a pretty piece of land.

LILY

And the Brocketts?

MUMFORD

Horror show. What'd you do tonight?

LILY

It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call

in the National Guard.

(he nods)

Then I did my laundry... watched

20/20.

MUMFORD

...And?

LILY

Shocking. Did you know the government

is wasteful?

(Mumford reacts)

You heard it here first. Oh, and

being a supermodel... it's no walk

in the park.

MUMFORD

Why do you watch?

LILY

No gentleman caller, Doc.

(they turn back)

Not that I care. I've had it with

men. They're so fascinated by their

own crap. Took me four years to get

the last one out. Almost turned me

into a dyke... These days my idea of

a hot date is a long shower by myself

before bed. Now that feels good. And

you don't have to do all that...

listening.

LILY

Oops... sorry. I guess that's the

story of your life.

SOFIE

I'm not making any promises.

MUMFORD

We'll turn back anytime you want.

SOFIE

(seeing something)

Oh boy... this should be interesting.

SOFIE

Hello, Mother. I want you to meet

Dr. Mumford.

MRS. COOK

Mumford... like the town?

MUMFORD

(offering his hand)

Yes. It's nice to meet you, Mrs.

Cook.

MRS. COOK

What's happening here?

SOFIE

We're going for a walk.

MRS. COOK

Do you think that's a good idea?

SOFIE

Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself

completely in his hands. For today,

anyway.

MRS. COOK

What kind of doctor are you?

MUMFORD

Ph.D., psychologist.

MRS. COOK

Oh... not a real doctor.

MUMFORD

That's right, the fake kind.

SOFIE

We'd better go or I'm liable to bail

on the whole thing.

SOFIE

Mom's such a cutie.

MUMFORD

People usually have to get to know

me before they hate me.

SOFIE

She's not in a bad mood. She's like

that all the time.

(a beat)

It doesn't bother me anymore. It's

my dad and my brother I worry about.

MUMFORD

Maybe... but you're the one whose

ass is dragging.

SOFIE

(laughs)

Is that the technical description of

what I've got?

MUMFORD

Is she against you getting help?

SOFIE

We don't discuss it.

MUMFORD

Something's bothering her.

SOFIE

Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me,

especially, but Dad, of course. She

thinks my brother's all right, but

she didn't expect much. It's what

happens when you "marry beneath

yourself"...

MUMFORD

Please... forgive me.

SOFIE

What?

MUMFORD

Negative thinking makes everything

more difficult. If you're going to

have enough strength to do this, we

have to talk only about positive

things. All right?

MUMFORD

Okay then... Are you positive your

mother's a bitch?

(she laughs, surprised)

Just kidding.

SOFIE

You've got a funny idea of funny.

MUMFORD

(seems worried)

I've offended you!

SOFIE

No.

MUMFORD

Really? What would it take?

SOFIE

Is this the treatment?

MUMFORD

Sorry... I'm done.

SOFIE

'Cause I'll tell you, none of the

others have tried this approach.

SOFIE

(absurdly unconvincing)

Hey, 'Just do it!'

MUMFORD (O.S.)

I want you to tell me all your

symptoms.

SOFIE

I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.

MUMFORD

Be specific.

SOFIE

Well... I'm tired all the time,

obviously. I always feel like taking

a nap. But when I try to sleep, I

have trouble.

(Mumford nods)

My muscles ache. And my joints. I

feel like an old person, or like I

did back when I used to work out too

hard... What else?...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Sore throat?

SOFIE (V.O.)

Uh-huh.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Low grade fever?

MUMFORD

Painful lymph glands?

(yes)

Forget fulness... irritability...

depression?

SOFIE

Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also...

I get confused.

MUMFORD

Yeah, most people have that. It's

confusing here.

SOFIE

Where?

MUMFORD

Life.

SOFIE

I don't know if I mentioned the

headaches.

MUMFORD

Did you get headaches before this?

(Sofie: yes)

But you get more now? Or more severe?

SOFIE

No, not really. They're about the

same. My marriage was one long

headache.

MUMFORD

So the headaches may not even be a

part of this?

MUMFORD

I can give myself a headache

instantly.

SOFIE

Is that like a party trick?

MUMFORD

All I have to do is have two

conflicting thoughts at the same

time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking

these walks is going to help Sofie

get better.' But then I'll also think --

'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these

walks and you're kidding yourself

about the benefits.'

MUMFORD

There... I've given myself a real

whopper.

SOFIE

You actually address yourself by

name in your thoughts?

(Mumford laughs)

So you really think having two

opposing ideas in your head does

some kind of damage?

MUMFORD

Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two

different directions at once. It

makes tiny little tears in our fabric.

SOFIE

Well then, my life has been some

kind of huge rip.

FOLLETT (V.O.)

The town was a rube's heaven, but I

found work my first day out down at

Old Man Sutter's gas station and

diner. I knew his stacked young wife

was going to be a problem, but, hey,

life is full of problems. Back at

the boarding house, I was washing up

when I heard a load of yellin' and --

LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER

...get off my case! You don't like

any of my friends...

FOLLETT (V.O.)

...I got my first look at the

landlady's daughter.

FOLLETT (V.O.)

Lucky for me, she was plenty upset

but not too careful.

FOLLETT (V.O.)

Or maybe it wasn't an accident at

all --

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Mr. Follett.

FOLLETT (V.O.)

-- 'cause in that instant I saw the

beginning of a vixen's smile and I

knew --

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Henry!

FOLLETT

What?

MUMFORD

Stop now.

FOLLETT

Why? I'm paying for this.

MUMFORD

Not for this. Not me, you're not.

FOLLETT

(challenging)

You find it distasteful, don't you?

MUMFORD

It doesn't matter how I feel about

it. It's how you feel about it that

matters.

FOLLETT

I enjoy it. Does that make me some

kind of pervert? Just because a man

has a rich imaginative life --

MUMFORD

You didn't come to me because you

have a rich imagination.

FOLLETT

No?

MUMFORD

You came because it's taking over.

You're in its grip.

FOLLETT

I never said that.

MUMFORD

Where's your wife, Henry?

MUMFORD

Where's your wife, Henry?

FOLLETT

Go to hell.

MUMFORD

(softer)

I didn't hear you.

FOLLETT

We got divorced.

(petulant)

I had to get rid of her. She couldn't

satisfy me.

MUMFORD

(shouts, Follett jumps)

What?!

FOLLETT

(softly)

I was... never satisfied.

MUMFORD

(normal again)

Now we're back on track.

MUMFORD

What's that?

FOLLETT

(long beat)

You are so mean.

MUMFORD

Hey, Skip.

SKIP

Doc. I know we're not supposed to

get together till Wednesday...

MUMFORD

That's all right. What's on your

mind?

SKIP

How many sessions have we had now,

Doc?

(Mumford tries to

remember)

Six. And it's been good... like we

were two buddies hanging out. Just

shootin' the shit.

MUMFORD

Yep.

SKIP

This is really hard. Everything I

want to say is hard...

SKIP

...We're like friends, almost... who

trust each other.

SKIP

I want to tell you something, Doc,

but before I do, I need to ask you a

question... Because, for me to tell

you this thing -- well, I haven't

told anybody about this. It's the

biggest secret I've got.

MUMFORD

Sometimes it's best to keep a few

things just for ourselves.

SKIP

You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I

supposed to be able to tell you

everything?

MUMFORD

It's just a thought.

SKIP

That really relates to the thing I

want to ask you... I've noticed that

sometimes, not a lot, but sometimes,

when we're hanging out, throwin' the

ball... or that time we went

bowling... sometimes you'll like --

(gets it out fast --)

-- tell me things about your other

patients.

SKIP

Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't

know all that much about psychology

or therapy or... ethics, so maybe

there's something I missed... or

something...

MUMFORD

You're concerned that maybe I can't

be trusted with a secret.

SKIP

I trust you. Definitely. No question.

But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I

mean, you're not supposed to tell

anyone about your patients'

problems... are you?

MUMFORD

That is correct, Skip. I'm going to

have to take a long look at that.

SKIP

Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell

you --

MUMFORD

-- Skip. Knowing what you do about

me --

SKIP

Doc, I trust you! You've listened to

me better than anybody... maybe ever.

(leans in, intense)

And this secret I've got, I can't

stand it anymore. I don't know if

I'm some kind of --

SKIP

-- I don't know if I'm a pervert or

what. It's taken me this long to get

where I can come out and say it... I

can't back away now. I can't spend

another day not knowing if I'm nuts.

SKIP

All right, I'm just gonna tell you,

as simple and direct as I can.

(one last spasm of

doubt)

And you understand that this is a

big secret? Just between us?

(Mumford does)

Okay. You know I've got this gift

for certain kinds of... machines.

MUMFORD

You are Panda, monarch of modems.

SKIP

That's right. And you also know that

even though I make 23% of the modems

in the world... I cannot make one

simple connection with any woman who

could truly love me.

MUMFORD

Okay... let's say that, for now.

SKIP

It's true, believe me. So... do you

know what I've been doing, all alone,

in my workshop, for almost two

years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill-

It. How I spend my every solitary

hour?

SKIP

Guess.

(Mumford demurs)

Go ahead, guess!

MUMFORD

(if he must)

Jerking off?

SKIP

No!... Although that's a good guess.

No, what I've been working on, what

the world really needs and no one

has been able to create --

(leans in, whispering)

-- a virtually life-like, humanoid,

gender-specific, anatomically

functional... sexual surrogate slash

companion.

MUMFORD

Slash what?

SKIP

Sexual surrogate... slash...

companion.

MUMFORD

A doll?

SKIP

No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm

talking about much, much more than a

doll. The world has never seen what

I'm talking about... except maybe in

the movies.

MUMFORD

How's it coming?

SKIP

You don't think I'm insane?

MUMFORD

("no")

And that's your secret?

(Skip: "yes")

You meant -- like a trade secret?

SKIP

No, Doc, a private secret! It's

perverted, it's pitiful. What am I --

Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?

MUMFORD

Sounds like kind of a good idea.

SKIP

(nonplussed)

Really?

MUMFORD

Definitely.

MUMFORD

Skip, that's not much of a secret.

SKIP

(hurt)

It's not?

MUMFORD

Oh, it's okay. It's just not something

to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't

want people knowing -- and believe

me, it's safe with me -- but on the

scale of dirty little secrets, I'd

give it, say... a two.

MUMFORD

You want to know a secret? I'll tell

you a secret. Since it's just between

us and all...

MUMFORD

The secret, Skip, is this -- I am

not now, nor have I ever been... a

psychologist.

MUMFORD

We'd better get going. Just follow

my light. And, Skip, watch your step.

SKIP

Who else knows?

MUMFORD

Just you.

SKIP

It's time you did some talkin', Dr.

Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your

name, isn't it?

SKIP

Damn! What is your name?

MUMFORD

Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.

SKIP

It matters to me.

SKIP

I've told you a lot of private stuff.

MUMFORD

I can tell you anything else.

SKIP

What about everything? How did this

happen?

MUMFORD

Did you know that every species of

mammal has found some way to drug,

inebriate, or anestnetize itself?

Even if it's just banging its head

against a rock. Seems to be some

natural urge... to get away for a

while.

(one more look at

Skip)

I've had it for as long as I can

remember. The first place I wanted

out of was home...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

I thought I had the best parents in

Bald Knob, West Virginia... till I

was seven years old and got a look

at some others. They weren't bad

folks...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

...but they were real unhappy about

being who they were...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

It made no sense that school came

easy for me... I didn't do much work,

and there was a proud tradition in

my family of being really dumb. My

friends didn't like it much. It made

them distrust me...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

On the other hand, it made some of

my classmates like me better... I

don't know what it was in me, maybe

some genes from my mom, maybe some

discomfort with myself, but early on

I was drawn to any substance that

made me numb...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

When I got a scholarship to go out

of state to college, I was the first

one in my extended family who'd gone

beyond high school. At graduation,

my folks looked like a normal, happy

couple, which I guess they were about

10% of the time... out in public.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

My roommate was from a planet I had

never heard of called Scarsdale,

where everything was the opposite of

West Virginia...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

All the other kids, in fact, seemed

to know things I didn't. They were

friendly enough, but in four years,

I never got over feeling that I had

sneaked in... and was about to be

exposed as the hillbilly and imposter

I actually was.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

The thing that always made those

feelings go away was... fun. Fun was

drugs, fun was sex, fun was

aggressively doing nothing. The only

problem I had with degenerate, self-

destructive behavior was... I couldn't

get enough of it.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

All that fun eventually had an impact

on the work I was doing. I figured,

what the hell, it was only college,

after all. I'd straighten up when I

went out in the real world...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

I didn't want to jump into my career

right out of college. And since I

had no career, that turned out to be

not much of a problem...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

I had a series of challenging jobs

over the next few years...

MUMFORD

...pizza delivery, pipe fitting,

pest control... lots of jobs that

started with the letter "p". For

some reason, I kept losing these

jobs.

(takes a swig of beer)

The only mind-altering substance I

never had a problem with was alcohol.

I never got drunk. I didn't like the

feeling. But really, when you're as

fucked up as I was... big deal.

MUMFORD

Eventually, doing all these different

jobs, I noticed something. For some

reason, probably because I was too

stoned to talk, everywhere I went --

MUMFORD (V.O.)

-- people would talk to me, tell me

everything... their stories, their

problems, their innermost thoughts.

Sometimes they'd pretend they needed

advice, but mostly people just wanted

someone to listen.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Anyway, one day I was spraying for

termites when I had a vision --

MUMFORD (V.O.)

-- it was time to put my college

degree to work and get a job with a

desk.

SMASH CUT TO:

MUMFORD (V.O.)

I took the civil service exam and

found myself working at the Internal

Revenue Service, District 14, Central

Administrative Office. I started off

as a general records clerk...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

I guess the standards weren't too

high there, because my superiors got

excited and pushed me to take the

advancement tests...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

One guy in particular thought I should

be a Revenue Officer. There was more

money to be made as your

classification went up. Which had a

lot of appeal to me...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

...since, even though I was certain

I could stop anytime I wanted, I had

developed a real affection for

cocaine. It was my favorite hobby I

had ever had.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

But I sure didn't want to be a Revenue

Officer, where you were face to face

abusing -- and getting abused -- all

day long...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

...And being a Collection Agent was

definitely not in my genetic make-

up...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

But there was one job that looked

like it might be fun -- Investigator.

SKIP (V.O.)

Are you telling me your last job

before becoming a psychologist was --

SKIP

-- an investigator for the Internal

Revenue Service?

MUMFORD

Everybody has a story, Skip.

SKIP

Sounds like you have several.

MUMFORD

What it felt like was... a series of

separate, unconnected lives --

hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy,

garbage man, civil service guy...

(Yul Brynner accent)

...et cetera... et cetera. Every

time I'd leave a life, it felt good.

Whatever problems I was having were

suddenly gone. I had no friends and

I didn't talk to my family. The only

constant, stabilizing force in my

life was... drugs.

SKIP

An IRS investigator with a drug

problem?

MUMFORD

It wasn't the best situation.

SKIP

Did you carry a gun?

MUMFORD

Didn't need one. We didn't even need

a warrant for most of the shit we

did. Man, the IRS... we could go in

your bank account, your credit

cards... hell, we used to go into

doctors' files and get all the juicy

details. Nobody wants to argue with

the IRS.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

I got teamed with one of the top

guys, a fanatic named Gregory. He

always got his man, whether they

deserved it or not. He was a "closer"

and everybody admired that...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

He'd make the case and the Collection

guys would come in and clean up. Our

specialty was... sleazy skulking...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

We were a good team. I was a dope

addict and Gregory was insane.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Of course, him being insane didn't

make it all right that I fell in

love with his wife.

SKIP (V.O.)

Holy shit!

MUMFORD

(announcer-like)

"Get to know your therapist."

SKIP

You were messed up, man.

MUMFORD

(dry)

But look at me now...

SKIP

Hey, you've done good. Look at

yourself... you've cleaned up, you've

got a career --

SKIP

At least you pulled yourself out...

MUMFORD

Things got a lot worse.

SKIP

You and Candy...?

MUMFORD (V.O.)

The way the District Managers got

ahead and won their bonuses was by

generating maximum payments. That

meant the revenue officers had to

use all their "collection tools" --

seizures, liens, levies -- even if a

more reasonable compromise could

have been worked out. The best way

to reduce resistance from the

taxpayers was to build a convincing

case -- whether there'd actually

been a violation or not...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

That's where we came in. Our DM was

a particular sonuvabitch, and he

knew just how to get Gregory crazy.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

So several things were working on

Gregory when we started building a

case against a furniture maker named

Edmond Worrell...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

...and his family.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Gregory was acting more and more

irrational. We started doing things

that were over the line even for the

IRS. When I look back on it now, I'm

sure Gregory must have known about

Candy and me. On our team, I had

become...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

...the responsible one.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Sometimes when a case didn't work

out right, Gregory and this Revenue

Officer named McLure would put the

squeeze on the subject's accountant...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

There aren't many accountants who

don't have something to worry about

with the Service...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

The parties met repeatedly over a

period of months. The IRS offered to

settle for a sizable but, they said,

fair amount. Worrell said he'd done

nothing wrong and threatened to fight

it all the way to Washington. He

seemed pretty strong. I was secretly

pulling for him. McLure and the

District Manager stepped up the

pressure.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

What none of us down at the Service

knew was that Edmond Worrell had a

story too... Worrell's was that he'd

been fighting chronic depression for

thirty years. Under the heat of the

investigation, he fell off his

medication. One Tuesday morning, he

went down to the factory early, wrote

his family a letter, then used the

9mm automatic they kept there to

kill himself... The DM dropped the

case that day and started proceedings

to get rid of Gregory...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Gregory went home drunk, beat up

Candy and went out to drink some

more. Candy told me she didn't want

to see me again. She hated us both

and she was leaving us both... It

made perfect sense to me. I felt the

same way...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

...In fact, I was jealous of Candy.

I wanted to leave too, just like

her... get as far away from --

MUMFORD (V.O.)

-- me... as possible.

SKIP

And so you did...

SKIP

And the drugs?

MUMFORD

Harder than I thought. Took me three

tries. But I was highly motivated --

figured there was no point in leaving

me and taking that along. After two

bomb-outs, I found a place in the

desert...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

The joint wasn't fancy -- it was run

by an order of monks -- but it worked.

When I got out of there, I was just

about broke...

MUMFORD

...which seemed perfect for starting

something new. Be back.

SKIP

Somebody's taking a shower down there.

MUMFORD

That'd be Lily.

SKIP

I wish I could live in the shower.

I'd take five a day if I had the

time. I went to this spa in Germany,

a sanitarium practically, up on this

mountain. And the great thing --

they just kept you wet all day.

MUMFORD

Who'd you go with?

(Skip: "alone")

That's not good.

SKIP

How'd you do it?

(Mumford is confused)

The new you.

MUMFORD

You know how easy it is. A kid can

manage it if he wants a fake I.D.

You can do practically the whole

deal at your local Kinko's. The only

variable is how much pride you take

in the product.

SKIP

I know it starts with a birth

certificate...

MUMFORD

All new people start with that...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

With desktop publishing, you don't

have to deal with printers, supply

houses, or pesky government agencies.

Eventually you do have to get your

hands on a typewriter. Ever seen one

of those, Skip?

SKIP (V.O.)

(playing along)

Is that like a mimeograph?... What

about the name?

MUMFORD

What about it?

SKIP

"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the

name of the town you were going to?

MUMFORD

Oh. You got it backwards. I already

had the name when I started looking

for somewhere to settle. When I saw

this town on a map, I thought maybe

it was a sign. See...

MUMFORD (V.O.)

...Mickey Mumford was in Miss Rice's

kindergarten class with me. He was

killed with his parents in a wreck

on their way back from a Steelers

game. He was only six years old,

which is a real plus, so there's a

birth certificate if anyone checks --

but not much else. They died in

Pennsylvania, so there's no death

certificate in West Virginia... that's

also good.

SKIP (V.O.)

And a birth certificate is enough?

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Everything flows from that, and what

doesn't... can be easily purchased.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

Of course, my IRS training made it

easier. Once you've done that, there's

not much data you can't access and

use any way you want.

MUMFORD

In a free society, you are who you

say you are.

(smiling)

People should remember that before

they go around knocking this country.

(he gets up)

Skip, all this beer's got me sleepy.

SKIP

But you studied psychology, right?

You did the training and just never

got the degree?

MUMFORD

No... no training.

SKIP

(hopeful)

Psych major?

MUMFORD

English Lit.

SKIP

Jeez, man. But you're good at it!

MUMFORD

I understand what it's like to want

to leave a problem behind. That's

all most people are looking to do.

(shrugs)

Mainly, I listen.

SKIP

Where ya going? I've got a million

questions.

MUMFORD

See you Thursday... regular time.

SOFIE

...so we get on this incredible steam

engine train that runs up into the

mountains...

(she tosses a paper,

grunting)

...and this trip is everything it's

cracked up to be... an open car,

great views, the mountain air blowing

through. We're sitting there, married

for six years, and he says how he

likes it better when I put my hair

back...

SOFIE

That wasn't so good.

MUMFORD

You're doing great.

SOFIE

I don't know if I'm going to make it

the whole way.

MUMFORD

It doesn't matter. Go on.

SOFIE

Oh... this makes me sound irrational,

which is probably right, but there

was something about him saying this --

it was maybe the millionth time he'd

told me about some preference of

his. Well, I was so... tired of it.

(memories)

Seems like my whole life someone's

been telling me... I'm just not

getting it right. Can we rest for a

second?

SOFIE

You're purposely making me talk while

we do this...

(Mumford nods)

...because you think this is good

for me...

(nods again)

...and you're a sadistic bastard...

MUMFORD

Yes.

SOFIE

...who thinks there's nothing really

wrong with me.

MUMFORD

Oh, there's something wrong with

you, all right. Especially after

hearing that dream of yours, about

the Roto-Rooter.

SOFIE

That was really bad, wasn't it?

MUMFORD

Disgusting.

SOFIE

And I'll bet you can interpret the

whole thing

MUMFORD

It's pretty obvious to a trained

professional.

SOFIE

I hate those dreams where everything

means something.

MUMFORD

Is that when you split up?

SOFIE

No, that'd be a good story, but that

was just the beginning of the end.

We went on for another year or so.

SOFIE

So whose route is this?

MUMFORD

Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old.

Lives next door.

SOFIE

And he's where?

MUMFORD

In the capitol for Boy's Nation.

Five days. Why?

SOFIE

(heaves another paper)

I'm thinking a gal could make a good

living doing this. How hard could it

be squeezing out some fourteen year

old?

MUMFORD

You like it?

SOFIE

It's all right.

MUMFORD

Then you can expect me at 5:30

tomorrow morning.

SOFIE

And this is legitimate therapy?

MUMFORD

Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want

to do it alone.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

What is it, Nessa?

NESSA (V.O.)

Isn't she amazing? That is such a

wicked look.

MUMFORD (V.O.)

What do you want me to see?

NESSA (V.O.)

Just chill for a second. Look at

this guy, it appears he's actually

dead... but gorgeous.

NESSA

What are you doing? We're not done.

I just need to find the thing...

MUMFORD

If you don't want to have a session

today, it's okay.

NESSA

I want to have the session. I thought

it would be cool if I could show you

some of the things that interest me.

But I guess you're not into it...

which we already knew.

MUMFORD

What happened today?

NESSA

What are you talking about?

MUMFORD

Was it something that happened at

school?

NESSA

(petulant)

These appointments were not my idea,

remember.

MUMFORD

True. Should we stop them?

NESSA

I don't think you know what you're

talking about.

MUMFORD

Uh-huh.

NESSA

This shrink school you went to...

did you hear about it on an

infomercial?

NESSA

I want to live in the world these

people are in. No one ever says

anything in there, have you noticed?

So they're very cool. Like they're

all really deep. It's when people

start talking that everything goes

to shit.

NESSA

There's this kid at school... Martin

Brockett. He has some gigantic idea

of himself that no one else shares.

You wouldn't believe the crap he

lays on me... Who appointed him my

spiritual leader? If he has everything

so figured out how come his best

friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he

spend all his time chasing after me?

Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a

hummer...

MUMFORD

Do you think that's what he wants?

NESSA

(after a beat)

No. I don't know what he wants. But

I know I don't like being watched.

Nobody's ever paid any attention to

what I did, and I liked it just fine.

Where does he get off telling me I

disrespect myself?

(a beat)

Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.

MUMFORD

What's the deal?

LILY

They come through a few times each

year.

(greeting one cheerily)

Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you

again!

(back to Mumford)

It's a tour.

MUMFORD

Where am I supposed to eat?

LILY

You're on your own today, honey.

MUMFORD (O.S.)

Hey, Skip!

SKIP

Doc.

MUMFORD

Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip,

Lily.

LILY

It's a pleasure to meet you.

SKIP

(flustered)

Yeah... me you, too... I was at your

house...

LILY

Oh?

SKIP

Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's

very nice... I heard your shower.

LILY

I've seen you going by on your board,

but I didn't realize -- you're so

young... to be so...

SKIP

What?

MUMFORD

...so rich?

LILY

(gives him a look)

...so accomplished.

SKIP

I may be young, but Doc can tell

you, I'm very immature.

SKIP

So, is this like a Japanese

restaurant?

LILY

I'd better get in there.

SKIP

That's a lot of people all at once.

LILY

It's okay. They pre-order. There's a

choice of three entrees.

SKIP

What are they?

LILY

Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or

salad nicoise.

SKIP

Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.

LILY

(giggling)

You do?

SKIP

Yeah.

LILY

Well, come on in.

DELBANCO (O.S.)

Dr. Mumford.

MUMFORD

Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you

again.

DELBANCO

I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler.

She's the other therapist here in

town.

MUMFORD

(shaking her hand)

Of course... I've heard great things

about you.

SHEELER

Thank you.

DELBANCO

You never got back to me.

(Mumford doesn't

understand)

...I called to say we'd like to take

you out for a meal?... Kind of a

professional welcome.

MUMFORD

Forgive me, please. What a gracious

thought. We must do that.

SHEELER

When?

MUMFORD

Why don't I call you when I've got

my calendar in front of me?

DELBANCO

What are you doing for lunch?

MUMFORD

Right now?

DELBANCO

...annihilation anxieties engendered

by bad experiences with a depriving

mother... but no one can escape the

fear of death. It is, as Henry James

put it, "the worm at the core." Try

as we may to forget or ignore our

mortality, James said --

(theatrically)

-- "the skull will grin in at the

banquet."

DELBANCO

I've run on. Forgive me. We're here

to talk about you.

MUMFORD

Are we?

SHEELER

(covering)

What Ernest means, I think, is we're

very interested in other

methodology... different kinds of

training. We're great believers in

learning from each other. I've learned

so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...

DELBANCO

...And I from Phyllis.

SHEELER

(back to a previous

thread)

So... the University of Kentucky.

Who runs the program down there?

MUMFORD

My mentor was an amazing teacher

named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite

tragically in the collapse of a

gazebo.

DELBANCO

I think I've heard of him... a

disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?

MUMFORD

It's possible. I don't know about

that.

SHEELER

I suppose your extended training was

at an institution in that area?

MUMFORD

Lots of institutions. My graduate

advisor believed we should experience

as many environments as possible --

prisons, clinics, half-way houses.

For a while I was chief therapist in

a shopping mall. Had a little spot

next to the yogurt place.

DELBANCO

Interesting approach. What was his

name?

MUMFORD

Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She

passed last year in a train wreck.

Damned Amtrak.

SHEELER

I trained in the east, myself --

Cornell -- and I don't care what

anyone says, there really are regional

differences. I found the state

certification exams out here quite

harrowing... Did you?

MUMFORD

Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess

that's good... to keep out the quacks.

SHEELER

Which examiner did you have? I

probably know him.

MUMFORD

Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.

SHEELER

That was a terrible thing.

MUMFORD

(agrees)

I don't even know why hang-gliding

is considered a legitimate sport.

DELBANCO

(back on track)

We're interested in any new therapies.

How would you characterize your

approach?

MUMFORD

My approach?

SHEELER

Yes... your particular approach.

MUMFORD

I don't have one really. Most of the

time I'm faking it. See, I think

there's not much that can be done

about most problems... they're too

complicated, too deep-rooted by the

time I hear about them. The most I

can do, usually, is look and listen

real closely, try to catch some

glimpse of the secret life everybody's

got. If I can get a sense of that,

well then, maybe... just maybe, I

can help them out a little.

DELBANCO

I see.

ALTHEA

-- The argument had nothing to do

with it.

MUMFORD (O.S.)

I understand. I just want to know

what the argument was about.

ALTHEA

(hates to say)

I had ordered some books. "The 100

Greatest Books Ever Written."

MUMFORD (O.S.)

Uh-huh. What are they?

ALTHEA

Oh, all the great writers --

Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby

Dick... those people. Each is bound

in genuine premium leather with 22

carat gold accents. It's a magnificent

set -- and only $33.50 per volume.

Right away you get Great Expectations

for just $6.99.

MUMFORD (O.S.)

One hundred books?

ALTHEA

It's irrelevant. It had nothing to

do with what happened.

MUMFORD (O.S.)

What happened?

ALTHEA

We argued on Sunday. He went to work

on Monday and stayed in the city

during the week, like always. But on

Thursday, when he normally comes

home, he didn't. Didn't call either.

Not till Saturday afternoon.

MUMFORD

You must have been concerned.

ALTHEA

It's happened before.

(a beat)

I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling.

I can't understand it.

(a real question --)

I'll probably have a complete

depressoid collapse soon, won't I?

MUMFORD

Doubtful. What did he say?

ALTHEA

He said he wasn't coming back. He

said it wasn't working for him any

more. That it hadn't "worked for

him" for quite a while... You know

what I regret the most? I'm sorry I

let him make the kids take his name.

He was an acquirer.

(off Mumford's look)

He liked to acquire things.

ALTHEA

You think that has something to do

with my problem? Ordering all those

things?...

ALTHEA

...Like I was on some kind of campaign

to out-acquire him...

(excited now, playing

it out)

...If I was just an acquisition to

him, and he lost interest once he

had me --

ALTHEA

That can't be it. It's too simple.

And besides, I still like it. This

morning I ordered a marble turtle

cheese board from The Horchow

Collection.

(an odd look)

Can I tell you something just awful?

You know how people who are just

assholes will sometimes look at a

woman who's got problems and say,

"What she needs is a good shtupping!"?

ALTHEA

Well, there may be something to that.

Jeremy didn't keep up his end -- Oh,

what difference does it make?

(suddenly)

Why do I feel elated? Am I in denial?

You know what it feels like?...

ALTHEA

I know my time's up, but I've got to

get this out while I've got hold of

it --

MUMFORD

Take your time.

ALTHEA

(no slowing down)

-- When I was in high school, the

thing I wanted most, when I was stuck

in class, the thing I was always

desperately in pursuit of -- was a

hall pass. That's all I wanted. I

loved moving freely around the school

while everybody else was trapped in

there... And that's how I feel right

now... Like I have some giant, all-

day hall pass.

ALTHEA

My god, did it just get hot in here

or what?

ALTHEA

See you next time. I'll probably be

a basket case by then.

MUMFORD

You can go out there if you like...

ALTHEA

(quoting Mumford)

"There's no shame in getting a little

therapy", right, Doc?

ALTHEA

Hello, Mr. Follett. Have a good

session. Bye, Doc.

MUMFORD

Henry...

SKIP (O.S.)

Hey, Doc!

SKIP

Thanks, Jennifer, I'll take him from

here.

SKIP

I've never brought anyone down here

before.

MUMFORD

I'm honored.

SKIP

Doc, there's something about what

you told me the other night I can't

get out of my head. It's driving me

batty --

(Mumford nods, waits)

Why me? How did you know you could

trust me?

MUMFORD

You're completely reliable.

SKIP

It's just me, Dino!

MUMFORD

Skip, I've got a problem and I need

some advice.

SKIP

You want my advice? Far out!

SKIP

I hope nothing you're about to see

will shake your faith in me.

SKIP

Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally

disgusted?

MUMFORD

("no")

Skip, you're a visionary. That can

be a burden.

SKIP

This doesn't seem a little...

perverse?

MUMFORD

There are a lot of lonely people in

the world. Somebody's gonna figure

this out someday.

SKIP

It's not going to be me. I'm giving

it up.

MUMFORD

Really?

SKIP

It's all your fault. In the last 48

hours, I've completely lost interest.

MUMFORD

What'd I do?

SKIP

Lily.

MUMFORD

Lily...

(gets it)

...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.

SKIP

Oh, she doesn't know about it yet.

Right now, of the two of us, I'm the

only one in love. But I'm very stoked.

SKIP

Doc, how I can be of help to you?

SKIP

Sorry...

MUMFORD

Wow.

SKIP

I'm here for you, Doc.

MUMFORD

Skip, you know that it's improper --

completely unethical -- for a licensed

psychologist to carry on a romantic

relationship with one of his patients?

SKIP

I guess that makes sense.

MUMFORD

Yes, yes it does...

SKIP

You've fallen in love with one of

your patients?

SKIP

Doc!... It's not me, is it?

MUMFORD

What?

MUMFORD

No, Skip, it's not you. But I like

you a lot.

SKIP

Doc, what about this? You're not

really a licensed psychologist!

SKIP

Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I

see where you're going here. It's a

mess.

MUMFORD

Yep.

LIONEL

Don't you find it incredibly

convenient that everyone who could

possibly corroborate his story has

recently died some exotic death?

DELBANCO

They're neither all recent nor exotic.

SHEELER

But they're certainly dead. And yes,

personally, I find it a bit odd.

DELBANCO

It could happen. What about his state

certification exams? The records

seem to be in order.

LIONEL

What's easier than hacking your way

into a state computer and inserting

some numbers? For all you know he

never even took the exams!

SHEELER

That's true.

DELBANCO

I don't know that it's all that

easy...

LIONEL

Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but

it sounds to me like you've gone for

this guy's story hook, line and bull-

twaddle.

SHEELER

You do seem much more disposed toward

him than I understand, Ernest. Did I

miss something?

DELBANCO

(sharply)

Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we

have no reason to doubt the man! Are

we listening to Lionel now?

DELBANCO

Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to

shout...

SHEELER

No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am

sorry. Sorry to have wasted your

time with such...

LILY

Stop it! He's a kid. I'm old enough

to be his... older sister.

COOK

Dr. Mumford. Please, come in.

MUMFORD

Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if

Sofie was around?

COOK

Were you supposed to have a session?

MUMFORD

No. It's sort of spur of the moment.

COOK

Look who's here. Have you met Sofie's

moth--

MRS. COOK

-- We've met.

COOK

And our son, Ben...

BEN

(vigorously shakes

hands)

This is a real honor, Doctor. Have a

seat, will ya?

MUMFORD

Well, actually, I can't really... Do

you think I could see Sofie?

BEN

I insist! I've been wanting to meet

you.

MRS. COOK

(icy)

Sofie's not here.

COOK

Her friend from the city came and

took her out to dinner. First time

in a long time she's been willing.

MUMFORD

A friend?

BEN

We owe that to you. She's perked up

a lot since you started treating

her.

MRS. COOK

What'd you want?

MUMFORD

There's something I think we need to

talk about.

MRS. COOK

What?

MR. COOK

Elizabeth...

MRS. COOK

I think we have a right.

BEN

We certainly do not.

MRS. COOK

Keep it zipped, Ben.

MR. COOK

Is there something we need to know,

Dr. Mumford?

MUMFORD

Well... yes, I guess I should tell

you. I don't think I'm going to be

able to treat Sofie anymore.

MRS. COOK

Finally, some common sense...

MUMFORD

What do you mean?

MRS. COOK

I think you know what I mean.

MUMFORD

No, I really don't.

MRS. COOK

I think you do.

MUMFORD

Why don't you tell me?

MRS. COOK

(very calm)

Why don't you go to hell? It's all a

bunch of nonsense and you know it.

MR. COOK

Elizabeth, I'm tellin' you, stop

this...

MRS. COOK

(dismissive)

You're telling me? That's rich...

MUMFORD

(standing up)

I'd better go.

BEN

Why can't you see Sofie? I know the

treatment's working.

MUMFORD

Well... you see, the problem is --

MRS. COOK

-- the problem is you're a big fake.

You haven't got a clue what's wrong

with that girl.

MUMFORD

Wow. You're something.

MRS. COOK

Take a hike, Dr. Quack!

MR. COOK

(ignoring her now)

What is the problem, Doctor?

MUMFORD

Problem? I guess there is no

problem... Uh, this friend of Sofie's,

where'd he take her?

BEN

It's she -- Roxy. Used to work with

her. I think they went over to The

Lantern.

MUMFORD

(delighted)

Oh, Roxy! Excellent. Roxy.

FOLLETT

What is it?

MUMFORD

It's a thought I had.

FOLLETT

Should I open it now?

MUMFORD

Let me just say something here... I

have no idea if this is going to

help.

FOLLETT

What exactly is it supposed to do?

MUMFORD

You remember when I asked you about

pornography --

FOLLETT

-- I find it degrading. Maximum

gynecology and minimum turn-on --

MUMFORD

-- and you told me that. Still,

there's some kind of imagery that's

haunting you and, I think, getting

in your way --

FOLLETT

-- Which I don't necessarily agree.

MUMFORD

But you did come to me.

MUMFORD

My guess is these images were burned

into your brain when you were young.

Maybe if we could nail down the exact

fantasies that are haunting you --

maybe you could get past them...

Anyway, I thought we could try an

experiment.

FOLLETT

(indicating the box)

And the experiment is in here?

MUMFORD

You know what? I think this was a

dumb idea...

MUMFORD

...I just heard myself talking and I

realize I'm completely unqualified

to be doing this. Let's forget the

whole thing.

FOLLETT

Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I

want to know what's in here.

MUMFORD

(pulling on the box)

There's absolutely no reason to think

this is going to have any impact on

you. I'm embarrassed to have --

FOLLETT

Hey! I agree with you that you don't

know what you're talking about. That's

what I've been saying all along. And

I can guarantee you that looking at

the Lost Ark or whatever you got in

here is not going to mean diddly to

me...

(quieting down)

...but if you think I'm going to let

you walk out of here without seeing

what's in this box, you don't know

much about Henry A. Follett.

YOUNG PHARMACIST (O.S.)

Mr. Follett --

FOLLETT

What?! What the hell is so important

I can't have five minutes --?

YOUNG PHARMACIST

It's her, sir. You told me to get

you when she came to pick up her

prescription.

FOLLETT

Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...

(indicates box)

...I really appreciate what you're

trying to... uh, I can't thank you

enough for...

MUMFORD

My pleasure.

FOLLETT

I'll see you on... whatever...

SOFIE

When I was in high school we used to

come up here and make out. I liked

to sit on the rock and watch the sun

go down.

MUMFORD

That's what I like.

SOFIE

Which thing?

MUMFORD

Either one.

SOFIE

Why'd you come to the house the other

night?

MUMFORD

I thought I had something to tell

you. But it turned out I didn't.

SOFIE

My brother said you were about to

fire me.

MUMFORD

That's one way to put it.

SOFIE

I bet I know what changed your mind...

(Mumford looks at her)

...My mother. She was so horrible,

you decided you couldn't desert me.

MUMFORD

I thought only action movies had

villains like that.

SOFIE

That's the cut-off, isn't it?

(Mumford nods)

I know why you were going to quit

seeing me.

SOFIE

You feel like a fake, an imposter...

SOFIE

...as if maybe you don't know what

you're doing.

SOFIE

Everybody feels that way sometimes...

like we're not who we're supposed to

be. But I have to tell you, Dr.

Mumford --

SOFIE

-- you've been a tremendous help to

me.

MUMFORD

Yeah?

SOFIE

I can't tell you how much I admire

you. You have a wonderful way with

people. And you're very insightful.

I feel like you've seen me clearly...

I never used to admit what a horrible

person my mother was. You've made

that possible for me.

MUMFORD

That's... good?

SOFIE

Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never

accepted me for who I was, just like

Mother. The things you've said have

helped me understand what a dick he

is.

MUMFORD

I don't know if --

SOFIE

You're shockingly honest, that's

what makes you great. I've never had

a man treat me this way. With you, I

feel really... listened to.

(gives him a look)

Can I tell you something? It's a

little embarrassing, but I feel very

unguarded with you.

MUMFORD

Of course.

SOFIE

Thanks to this therapy, I now know

what I'm looking for. I need to find

a man like you.

(laughs)

Not one who's treating me, of course.

(full of resolve)

And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've

given me the confidence.

MUMFORD

Sofie... that makes me very happy.

NESSA

...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously

deluded. I said that to him, I said,

"If you think I'm gonna do all that

shit for you, man, you are seriously

deluded."

MUMFORD

What'd he say?

NESSA

(can't hide her

pleasure)

He said -- "Which we already knew!"

MUMFORD

What did he want you to do?

NESSA

First off, he tells me to stop smoking

cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'-

lutely no. As you can see --

NESSA

Then he says stop smoking dope. No

again. So then he says he doesn't

want me getting together with any

other guys...

NESSA

...What balls on this guy? What're

we...

(too geeky for her)

...going steady? Jesus.

MUMFORD

No again?

NESSA

(long pause)

I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns

me. And the last thing was insane. I

don't know what's wrong with him...

No magazines.

MUMFORD

Really?

NESSA

I don't know if I can quit. We're

gonna try it together, like, you

know, AA or something. And I made

him give up his .22. No more sneaking

around the hills with his fucking

nut gun like some loony tune.

MUMFORD

He agreed?

NESSA

(yes)

He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I

don't know how much longer I can put

up with it. I already got two arms

and legs, I don't need another

appendage.

NESSA

Oops... gotta go!

MARTIN

Hiya, Doc.

MUMFORD

Martin.

MARTIN

(pulling Nessa tighter)

Did you straighten her out?

MUMFORD

How are you?

MARTIN

Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family

got five hundred times better.

(turning Nessa)

Let's go, Vanessa.

GILROY (O.S.)

Doctor Mumford?

MUMFORD

I didn't see you there. Can I help

you?

GILROY

My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State

Certification Board.

GILROY

It's all right, it won't bite you.

Under civil code 1294.67b you are

entitled to be notified that your

status and certification are being

reviewed. This is the notice.

MUMFORD

(takes the paper)

Do you want to come in?

GILROY

(already leaving)

No thanks. Plenty of time for that

when we're a little further along.

MUMFORD

Mr. Gilroy --

MUMFORD

What brought this on?

GILROY

I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes

it's just routine, sometimes there's

been a complaint. We'll be in touch.

SKIP (O.S.)

Far out!

DELBANCO

...and when you said at lunch about

everybody having "a secret life",

something just snapped inside me. I

knew I could no longer continue my

relationship with Dr. Sheeler. It

was tearing me up inside. And I know

Phyllis wasn't getting what she needed

from it. What had started as a genuine

respect, I think, for each other's

professional abilities, and became,

over time, a personal attraction had

somehow... migrated into a rather

torrid sexual relationship...

DELBANCO

...I won't go into that today. Though,

if we should continue these sessions,

as I certainly hope we will, there

are some aspects of that I would

like to look at. God knows, I've

listened to enough people giving me

the juicy --

(catches himself)

...At any rate, I just wanted to

acknowledge the catalyzing effect

your comment had on me. I just hope

that it doesn't come roiling back

upon you like some dreadful undertow.

MUMFORD

How do you mean?

DELBANCO

Well... you see, when I broke it off

with Phyllis, she was naturally upset

and she became more determined than

ever to pursue certain -- how to put

it -- doubts she's been harboring...

MUMFORD

What kind of doubts?

DELBANCO

About you... your background and

your qualifications. I'm afraid

Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in

her fury with me, and actually took

the whole issue to the state board.

MUMFORD

I see.

DELBANCO

And please, for whatever small way I

may have encouraged this, accept my

apologies.

(brightens)

There is good news, though.

MUMFORD

What's that?

DELBANCO

Phyllis has decided to leave town

and pursue her practice in the city.

Which leaves you the only psychologist

in town.

MUMFORD

Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm

sorry to hear that.

DELBANCO

As you can imagine, my own feelings

about this are mixed... Unlike, I

must say, those of my wife.

FOLLETT (V.O.)

Old Man Sutter's young bride had got

me in hot water all right, and now I

was bein' dealt the beating of my

life. If there'd just been two of

those bastards it would have been a

little closer...

FOLLETT (V.O.)

The Landlady was good at quite a few

things, but doctoring wasn't one of

them...

FOLLETT (V.O.)

...Lucky for me, one of the other

boarders, the broad who lived

downstairs in the front room...

FOLLETT (V.O.)

...was a nurse...

FOLLETT (V.O.)

...and she had ways to make you feel

better they didn't teach in nursing

school.

MUMFORD

I'm very happy for you, Henry.

MUMFORD

I feel like we're making real progress

here.

FOLLETT

Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you

what that package meant to me --

SOFIE

I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can

I come in?

MUMFORD

Of course.

SOFIE

We haven't met in this office since

that first time. This is how a real

professional and his client are

supposed to see each other.

SOFIE

It might've been more appropriate if

we had followed a traditional approach

to the doctor-patient relationship.

MUMFORD

Is something wrong, Sofie?

SOFIE

Yes, something's very wrong, Dr.

Mumford.

MUMFORD

You're upset.

SOFIE

How intuitive! That must take years

of training right there. Maybe you

can guess what has upset me.

MUMFORD

Is it something you've heard about

me?

SOFIE

No, it is not something I've heard

about you! It is someth--

(stops suddenly)

Why? Is there something I should

have heard about you?

MUMFORD

Why don't you tell me what's on your

mind?

SOFIE

May I?

SOFIE

All right... I'm going to come right

out and say this, because that's

what your shrink is for, right, so

you can tell him what's bothering

you?

MUMFORD

Um-huh.

SOFIE

(tone still rough)

First of all, I have been feeling

much better lately. I don't know if

the syndrome is over -- if it's just

run its course or something -- but I

feel a hundred per cent better than

when I first came to you.

MUMFORD

I'm glad.

SOFIE

Given that, I'm obviously not going

to be judging things in the most

realistic way.

MUMFORD

I don't follow you.

SOFIE

(sharply)

I'm saying that since I'm doing so

much better -- which I attribute to

you -- I'm liable to misinterpret

some of my feelings.

MUMFORD

(tentative)

Okay...

SOFIE

The point is this -- I am not a blank

page. I did not just fall off the

turnip truck. Do you know what I

mean?

MUMFORD

I think so.

SOFIE

I know a little about psychology. I

took three different courses in

college. It's true, none of them

were above the two hundred level,

but I took them... And there was one

concept I remember very well.

MUMFORD

What was that?

SOFIE

Transference!

MUMFORD

Transference.

SOFIE

Yes, and that is what I have got

right now. I have taken my feelings

of gratitude... and relief... and

transferred them onto... you. I have

taken all those warm, grateful

emotions and confused them with

feelings for you... So that now I am

under the delusion...

(a deep breath)

...that I am in love with you.

SOFIE

Hello?

MUMFORD

Hello.

SOFIE

I think you can understand why I

have some serious questions about

your methods. I mean, obviously it

becomes much more likely that I'm

going to have confusion about this

when your idea of treatment is to go

walking in the woods and up to make-

outs-ville and do all these highly

romantic activities --

SOFIE

-- We had a paper route together,

for godssake! Do you understand how

I might be a little resentful? Knowing

that this so-called "love" I'm feeling

is totally bogus, and just a pathetic

case of... transference?

MUMFORD

Yes.

SOFIE

Maybe you ought to think about how

you're going to fix this. And when

you do...

(suddenly losing her

will)

...please get back to me.

MUMFORD

Hey, Ainge.

LILY

Doc...

MUMFORD

(keeps walking)

Lily.

LILY

Doc.

LILY

I don't want you to be mad at Skip...

MUMFORD

He told you.

LILY

(yes)

Skip and I wouldn't have got together

if it weren't for you. That's a big

deal.

MUMFORD

(dismisses it)

You would have met in some shower

eventually...

LILY

I want to give you something. Will

you let me?

MUMFORD

Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.

LILY

Yes, you do, you damn well do.

MUMFORD

(can't fight)

Okay.

LILY

Here it is, some advice -- do the

hard thing.

MUMFORD

That's it? That's what you're giving

me?

LILY

Clean up the mess. No matter what it

takes.

MUMFORD

What it might take is... doing time.

LILY

Too bad. That's tough, I mean it.

I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says

you're in love.

LILY

Then it's worth it.

MUMFORD

I'll tell her tonight.

ROBERT STACK

...A drug rehabilitation center in

the lonely southwestern desert...

run by reclusive monks... becomes

the point of departure in a mysterious

vanishing...

ROBERT STACK

...as an intrepid government

investigator disappears -- without a

trace.

ROBERT STACK

...despite brilliant promise as a

fearless investigator... found himself

on a downward spiral of drug abuse

and dissolution...

MUMFORD'S SISTER

...we didn't talk much after our

folks died, but I know he felt his

life had taken a wrong turn...

ROBERT STACK

His former undercover partner at the

IRS... is now a trooper with the

Pennsylvania State Police...

GREGORY

The guy was obsessed... didn't always

know where to draw the line... but I

would have trusted him with my wife --

er, my life --

(looks off camera,

laughing)

-- What'd I say? Both, actually...

(gets serious again)

...I can't say I was surprised,

though, when he disappeared.

ROBERT STACK

Who was this enigma... a courageous

public servant or a debauched

addict?... Either way, his last known

stop was here... isolated in the

Arizona desert... taken in by an

order of devoted monks...

BROTHER TIMOTHY

We don't talk about the people who've

been our guests... but I can tell

you this about our order -- we believe

everybody has the right to start

over... everybody deserves a second

chance.

ROBERT STACK

And perhaps... that is exactly the

chance the now-sober pilgrim took...

on a blustery November day... walking

away from the rehab center... never

to be heard from again...

MUMFORD'S SISTER

I'd like to know if he's alive. If

he is, I just hope he's happy and

his new life is...

(not sure how to put

it)

...well, I hope he's found what he

was looking for...

ROBERT STACK

If you have any information about

this man or know anything about his

whereabouts, contact the Sheriff's

Department in Cochise County, Arizona,

or call this number...

MRS. COOK

Well, look who's here...

MUMFORD

Good evening, Mrs. Cook.

MRS. COOK

Just who is here, can you tell me?

MUMFORD

Could I see Sofie, please?

MRS. COOK

No, you can not. I wouldn't know who

to say is calling.

SOFIE (O.S.)

Mother...

MRS. COOK

I could see right through you from

the start, you imposter. I know what

you're after. I knew it then and I

know it now!

SOFIE

Mother...

MUMFORD

What do you think I'm after, Mrs.

Cook?

MRS. COOK

Sofie. It's so obvious... you're

after my daughter.

MUMFORD

Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're

right about that.

MRS. COOK

It'll never happen! You're in big

trouble, mister.

SOFIE

(scary strong)

Mother... go away!

MUMFORD

I guess you saw the show...?

SOFIE

Which show was that?

MUMFORD

Sofie...

SOFIE

Part of it. We were watching "ER"

until someone called.

MUMFORD

You probably got the idea.

SOFIE

Do you know what a betrayal this

is?...

SOFIE

...How violated I feel?

MUMFORD

You're not the only one...

SOFIE

You feel violated?

MUMFORD

Not me... all my other my patients.

I smelled tar and feathers on the

way over here.

SOFIE

You deserve it.

SOFIE

I should be irate.

SOFIE

I am irate!

MUMFORD

(grabbing at the thread)

But...

SOFIE

But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This

is a terrible thing you've done.

MUMFORD

I know it! Please believe me, I know

that...

MUMFORD

But, there is one... mitigating factor

I want you to consider before you

write me off.

SOFIE

What?

MUMFORD

Will you think about it?

SOFIE

I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad

mood.

MUMFORD

I love you. More than I've ever loved

anyone or anything in my life.

SOFIE

Oh.

MUMFORD

I want to spend the rest of my life

with you... but I'm not sure you

feel the same way.

SOFIE

I sort of do...

SOFIE

...but first, you have to tell me

something...

MUMFORD

Anything... just ask.

SOFIE

What is your name?

JUDGE OTTO (O.S.)

The defendant will rise.

JUDGE OTTO (O.S.)

Sit down, Lionel.

JUDGE OTTO

Clarence Norman White, do you

understand how serious are the crimes

with which you have been charged?

MUMFORD

I do.

JUDGE OTTO

Do you realize how insidious it is

to invade the most private thoughts

and secret lives of unsuspecting

people?...

JUDGE OTTO

...People who have come to you with

the faith that you know what you're

doing... and that you are who you

say you are?

MUMFORD

Yes, your honor.

JUDGE OTTO

It means absolutely nothing to me

that so many of your patients have

come forward with praise for you and

your therapeutic skills. You

understand that?

MUMFORD

Yes.

JUDGE OTTO

Mr. White, I am frustrated that the

criminal code in this state allows a

maximum sentence of only six months

and a maximum fine of only $2000.

MUMFORD

I'm sorry, your honor.

JUDGE OTTO

What?

MUMFORD

I'm sorry you're frustrated.

JUDGE OTTO

Are you disrespecting this court,

Mr. White?

MUMFORD

No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.

JUDGE OTTO

Maybe you can empathize with this --

Maximum fine. Three months in jail,

three months house arrest. Sentence

to begin immediately at the Orchard

Valley Correctional Facility. Case

closed. This court is adjourned.

LIONEL

It's a country club. Don't worry

about it.

MUMFORD

Thanks for your help, Lionel.

LIONEL

I'll have him out in half the time.

SOFIE

You got off easy.

MUMFORD

Will you wait for me?

SOFIE

We're only talking about six weeks.

MUMFORD

Will you be here?

SOFIE

Of course... I haven't got the energy

to get out of town that fast.

CUT TO:

CORRECTIONAL OFFICER

Better make yourself comfortable. We

got a three hour drive here.

MUMFORD

I'm fine.

CORRECTIONAL OFFICER

You're the shrink, aren't you?

MUMFORD

No, not really.

CORRECTIONAL OFFICER

But you do therapy?

MUMFORD

Not any more.

CORRECTIONAL OFFICER

I'll tell you, Doc, the wife and I,

we got a little bit of a problem.

Would you mind if I just ran it by

you?

MUMFORD

Go ahead.

THE END
