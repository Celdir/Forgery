THE APARTMENT

by

Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond

THE APARTMENT

BUD (V.O.)

On November first, 1959, the

population of New York City was

8,042,783.  if you laid all these

people end to end, figuring an

average height of five feet six and

a half inches, they would reach

from Times Square to the outskirts

of Karachi, Pakistan.  I know facts

like this because I work for an

insurance company --

BUD (V.O.)

-- Consolidated Life of New York.

We are one of the top five companies

in the country -- last year we

wrote nine-point-three billion

dollars worth of policies.  Our

home office has 31,259 employees --

which is more than the entire

population of Natchez, Mississippi,

of Gallup, New Mexico.

BUD (V.O.)

I work on the nineteenth floor --

Ordinary Policy Department -

Premium Accounting Division -

Section W -- desk number 861.

BUD (V.O.)

My name is C.C. Baxter - C. for

Calvin, C. for Clifford -- however,

most people call me Bud. I've been

with Consolidated Life for three

years and ten months.  I started in

the branch office in Cincinnati,

then transferred to New York.  My

take-home pay is $94.70 a week, and

there are the usual fringe benefits.

BUD (V.O.)

The hours in our department are

8:50 to 5:20 --

BUD (V.O.)

-- they're staggered by floors, so

that sixteen elevators can handle

the 31,259 employees without a

serious traffic jam.  As for

myself, I very often stay on at the

office and work for an extra hour

or two -- especially when the

weather is bad.  It's not that I'm

overly ambitious -- it's just a way

of killing time, until it's all

right for me to go home.

You see, I have this little problem

with my apartment --

DISSOLVE TO:

BUD (V.O.)

I live in the West Sixties - just

half a block from Central Park.  My

rent is $84 a month.  It used to be

eighty until last July when Mrs.

Lieberman, the landlady, put in a

second-hand air conditioning unit.

BUD (V.O.)

It's a real nice apartment -

nothing fancy -- but kind of

cozy -- just right for a bachelor.

The only problem is - I can't

always get in when I want to.

KIRKEBY

(calling off)

Come on, Sylvia.  It's getting late.

KIRKEBY

Cut it out, Sylvia.  We got to get

out of here.

SYLVIA

What's the panic?  I'm going to

have another martooni.

KIRKEBY

Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to

nine!

SYLVIA

(dropping slivers of

ice into the pitcher)

First you can't wait to get me up

here, and now -- rush, rush, rush!

Makes a person feel cheap.

KIRKEBY

Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not

that -- but I promised the guy I'd

be out of here by eight o'clock,

positively.

SYLVIA

(pouring martini)

What guy?  Whose apartment is this,

anyway?

KIRKEBY

(exasperated)

What's the difference?  Some

schnook that works in the office.

MRS. LIEBERMAN

Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

BUD

Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.

MRS. LIEBERMAN

Some weather we're having.  Must be

from all the meshugass at Cape

Canaveral.

(she is half-way up

the steps)

You locked out of your apartment?

BUD

No, no.  Just waiting for a friend.

Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.

MRS. LIEBERMAN

Good night, Mr. Baxter.

KIRKEBY

Come on -- come on, Sylvia!

SYLVIA

Some setup you got here.  A real,

honest-to-goodness love nest.

KIRKEBY

Sssssh.

SYLVIA

(still cha cha-ing)

You're one button off, Mr. Kirkeby.

SYLVIA

You got to watch those things.

Wives are getting smarter all the

time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the

Claims Department -- came home one

night with lipstick on his shirt --

told his wife he had a shrimp

cocktail for lunch -- so she took

it out to the lab and had it

analyzed -- so now she has the

house in Great Neck and the children

and the new Jaguar --

KIRKEBY

Don't you ever stop talking?

KIRKEBY

Where do you live?

SYLVIA

I told you -- with my mother.

KIRKEBY

Where does she live?

SYLVIA

A hundred and seventy-ninth

street -- the Bronx.

KIRKEBY

All right -- I'll take you to the

subway.

SYLVIA

Like hell you will.  You'll buy me

a cab.

KIRKEBY

Why do all you dames have to live

in the Bronx?

SYLVIA

You mean you bring other girls up

here?

KIRKEBY

Certainly not.  I'm a happily

married man.

BUD

Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

MRS. DREYFUSS

Something the matter?

BUD

I seem to have dropped my key.

(faking a little search)

Oh -- here it is.

MRS. DREYFUSS

Such a racket I heard in your

place -- maybe you had burglars.

BUD

Oh, you don't have to worry about

that -- nothing in there that

anybody would want to steal...

(unlocking door quickly)

Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

KIRKEBY

The little lady forgot her galoshes.

BUD

Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to

complain -- but you were supposed

to be out of here by eight.

KIRKEBY

I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But

those things don't always run on

schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.

BUD

I don't mind in the summer -- but

on a rainy night -- and I haven't

had any dinner yet --

KIRKEBY

Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in

a good word for you with Sheldrake,

in Personnel.

BUD

(perking up)

Mr. Sheldrake?

KIRKEBY

That's right.  We were discussing

our department -- manpower-wise --

and promotion-wise --

(finds the galoshes

behind a chair)

-- and I told him what a bright boy

you were.  They're always on the

lookout for young executives.

BUD

Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.

KIRKEBY

(starting toward door)

You're on your way up, Buddy-boy.

And you're practically out of liquor.

BUD

I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the

Mortgage Loan Department -- last

night he had a little Halloween

party here --

KIRKEBY

Well, lay in some vodka and some

vermouth -- and put my name on it.

BUD

Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me

for the last two bottles --

KIRKEBY

I'll pay you on Friday.

(in the open doorwaY)

And whatever happened to those

little cheese crackers you used to

have around?

BUD

(making a mental note)

Cheese crackers.

DR. DREYFUSS

Good evening, Baxter.

BUD

Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?

DR. DREYFUSS

Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's

57th Street ate a club sandwich,

and forgot to take out the toothpick.

BUD

Oh.

(sets down wastebasket)

'Bye, Doc.

DR. DREYFUSS

(indicating bottles)

Say, Baxter -- the way you're

belting that stuff, you must have a

pair of cast-iron kidneys.

BUD

Oh, that's not me.  It's just that

once in a while, I have some people

in for a drink.

DR. DREYFUSS

As a matter of fact, you must be an

iron man all around. From what I

hear through the walls, you got

something going for you every night.

BUD

I'm sorry if it gets noisy --

DR. DREYFUSS

Sometimes,  there's a twi-night

double-header.

(shaking his head)

A nebbish like you!

BUD

(uncomfortable)

Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc.

(starts to back

through door)

DR. DREYFUSS

You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some

research at the Columbia Medical

Center -- and I wonder if you could

do us a favor?

BUD

Me?

DR. DREYFUSS

When you make out your will -- and

the way you're going, you should --

would you mind leaving your body to

the University?

BUD

My body?  I'm afraid you guys would

be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.

DR. DREYFUSS

Slow down, kid.

ANNOUNCER

-- from the world's greatest

library of film classics, we

proudly present --

(fanfare)

Greta Garbo -- John Barrymore --

Joan Crawford -- Wallace Beery --

and Lionel Barrymore in --

(fanfare)

GRAND HOTEL!

ANNOUNCER

But first, a word from our sponsor.

If you smoke the modern way, don't

be fooled by phony filter claims --

ANNOUNCER

And now, Grand Hotel -- starring

Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan

Crawford --

(Bud is all eyes and

ears again)

-- Wallace Beery, and Lionel

Barrymore.  But first -- a word

from our alternate sponsor.

(unctuously)

Friends, do you have wobbly

dentures -- ?

BUD

Hello? -- Hello? -- yes, this is

Baxter.

DOBISCH

Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar

on Sixty-first Street -- and I got

to thinking about you -- and I

figured I'd give you a little buzz.

BUD

Well, that's very nice of you --

but who is this?

DOBISCH

Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in

Administration.

BUD

(snapping to attention)

Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't

recognize your voice --

DOBISCH

That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I

was saying, I'm in this joint on

Sixty-first -- and I think I got

lucky --

(glances toward blonde)

-- she's a skater with the Ice

Show --

(he chuckles)

-- and I thought maybe I could

bring her up for a quiet drink.

BUD

I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I

like to help you guys out -- but

it's sort of late -- so why don't

we make it some other time?

DOBISCH

Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that

long -- not even on ice.  Listen,

kid, I can't pass this up -- she

looks like Marilyn Monroe.

BUD

I don't care if it is Marilyn

Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and

I've taken a sleeping pill -- so

I'm afraid the answer is no.

DOBISCH

(pulling rank)

Look, Baxter -- we're making out

the monthly efficiency rating --

and I'm putting you in the top ten.

Now you don't want to louse yourself

up, do you?

BUD

Of course not.  But -- how can I be

efficient in the office if I don't

get enough sleep at night?

DOBISCH

It's only eleven -- and I just want

the place for forty-five minutes.

BLONDE

I'm getting lonely.  Who are you

talking to, anyway?

DOBISCH

My mother.

BLONDE

That's sweet.  That's real sweet.

DOBISCH

(into phone again)

Make it thirty minutes.  What do

you say, Bud?

BUD

(a last stand)

I'm all out of liquor -- and

there's no clean glasses -- no

cheese crackers -- no nothing.

DOBISCH

Let me worry about that.  Just

leave the key under the mat and

clear out.

BUD

(into phone; resigned)

Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

BUD

(muttering to himself)

Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch -- no

trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch -- be

my guest --

BUD

-- We never close at Buddy-boy's --

looks like Marilyn Monroe --

(he chuckles a la Dobisch)

NOT TOO LOUD

THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING

BLONDE

This the place?

DOBISCH

Yeah.

(to cab driver)

How much?

CABBIE

Seventy cents.

DOBISCH

Get the money, will you?

DOBISCH

Watch those stingers!

DOBISCH

Give him a buck.

DOBISCH

Now put it back, honey.

(she does)

Atta girl.

BLONDE

You sure this is a good idea?

DOBISCH

Can't think of a better one.

BLONDE

(holding door open

for him)

I mean - barging in on your

mother -- in the middle of the night?

DOBISCH

(edging past her with stingers)

Don't worry about the old lady.

One squawk from her, and she's out

of a job.

DOBISCH

Get the key, will you.

DOBISCH

Not there.  Under the mat.

BLONDE

(puzzled)

Under the mat?

(picks up key)

DOBISCH

(impatiently)

Open up, open up -- we haven't got

all night.

BLONDE

(suspiciously)

So this is your mother's apartment?

DOBISCH

That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya.

BLONDE

(sticking her head in)

Hiya, Ouspenskaya.

DR. DREYFUSS

(calling to his wife,

off-screen)

Mildred -- he's at it again.

FADE OUT.

BUD

(hoarsely)

Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.

KIRKEBY

(as if he just knew

him vaguely)

Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They

keeping you busy these days?

BUD

Yes, sir.  They are indeed.

(he sniffs)

FRAN

(rattling it off)

Morning, Mr. Kessel -- Morning,

Miss Robinson -- Morning, Mr.

Kirkeby -- Morning, Mr. Williams --

Morning, Miss Livingston -- Morning,

Mr. McKellway -- Morning, Mr.

Pirelli -- Morning, Mrs. Schubert --

FRAN

Morning, Mr. Baxter.

BUD

Morning, Miss Kubelik.

STARTER

(working the clicker)

That's all.  Take it away.

FRAN

(shutting the door)

Watch the door, please.  Blasting

off.

BUD

(studying her)

What did you do to your hair?

FRAN

It was making me nervous, so I

chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?

BUD

I sort of like it.

FRAN

Say, you got a lulu.

BUD

Yeah.  I better not get too close.

FRAN

Oh, I never catch colds.

BUD

Really?  I was looking at some

figures from the Sickness and

Accident Claims Division -- do you

know that the average New Yorker

between the ages of twenty and

fifty has two and a half colds a

year?

FRAN

That makes me feel just terrible.

BUD

Why?

FRAN

Well, to make the figures come out

even -- since I have no colds a

year -- some poor slob must have

five colds a year.

BUD

That's me.

(dabs his nose)

FRAN

You should have stayed in bed this

morning.

BUD

I should have stayed in bed last

night.

FRAN

Nineteen.  Watch your step.

FRAN

(all in the day's work)

And watch your hand, Mr. Kirkeby!

KIRKEBY

(innocently)

I beg your pardon?

FRAN

One of these days I'm going to shut

those doors on you and --

FRAN

Twenty next.

KIRKEBY

That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like

to get her on a slow elevator to

China.

BUD

Oh, yes.  She's the best operator

in the building.

KIRKEBY

I'm a pretty good operator myself --

but she just won't give me a

tumble -- date-wise.

BUD

Maybe you're using the wrong

approach.

KIRKEBY

A lot of guys around here have

tried it -- all kinds of

approaches -- no dice.  What is she

trying to prove?

BUD

Could be she's just a nice,

respectable girl -- there are

millions of them.

KIRKEBY

Listen to him.  Little Lord

Fauntleroy!

BUD

(cupping hand over

phone mouthpiece)

Hello, Mr. Dobisch? This is Baxter,

on the nineteenth floor.

DOBISCH

Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to

call you.

(shuts off electric shaver)

I'm sorry about that mess on the

living room wall. You see, my

little friend, she kept insisting

Picasso was a bum -- so she started

to do that mural -- but I'm sure it

will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.

BUD

It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

It's the key -- to my apartment --

you were supposed to leave it under

the mat.

DOBISCH

I did, didn't I? I distinctly

remember bending over and putting

it there --

BUD

Oh, I found a key there, all

right -- only it's the wrong key.

DOBISCH

It is?

(takes Bud's key out

of his pocket)

Well, how about that? No wonder I

couldn't get into the executive

washroom this morning.

BUD

And I couldn't get into my

apartment -- so at four a. m. I had

to wake up the landlady and give

her a whole song and dance about

going out to mail a letter and the

door slamming shut.

DOBISCH

That's a shame. I'll send the key

right down. And about your

promotion --

(leafs through report

on desk)

-- I'm sending that efficiency

report right up to Mr. Sheldrake,

in Personnel. I wouldn't be

surprised if you heard from him

before the day is over.

BUD

Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

MESSENGER

From Mr. Dobisch.

BUD

(thermometer in mouth)

Wait.

BUD

(thermometer in mouth)

To Mr. Dobisch.

VANDERHOF

Dear Mr. MacIntosh --

(phone rings and he

picks it up)

Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh,

yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

(to secretary)

All right, Miss Finch -- type up

what we got so far.

(he waits till she is

out of the office;

then, into phone)

Now what is it, Baxter?

BUD

Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you

down here for tonight -- but I'm

going to be using the place

myself -- so I'll have to cancel.

VANDERHOF

Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I

already ordered the cake --

BUD

I hate to disappoint you -- I mean,

many happy returns -- but not

tonight --

VANDERHOF

That's not like you, Baxter. Just

the other day, at the staff meeting,

I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a

reliable man you were.

BUD

Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm

sick -- I have this terrible

cold -- and a fever -- and I got to

go to bed right after work.

VANDERHOF

Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing

you can do. If you got a cold, you

should go to a Turkish bath --

spend the night there -- sweat it

out --

BUD

Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if

I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for

a month -- and if I were in bed for

a month --

VANDERHOF

Okay, you made your point. We'll

just have to do it next Wednesday --

that's the only night of the week I

can get away.

BUD

Wednesday -- Wednesday --

(leafing through calendar)

I got somebody penciled in -- let

me see what I can do -- I'll get

back to you.

BUD

(into phone)

Mr. Eichelberger? Is this Mortgage

and Loan? I'd like to speak to Mr.

Eichelberger. Yes, it is urgent.

ASSOCIATE

(holding out phone to Eichelberger)

For you, Mel.

EIGHELBERGER

Eichelberger here -- oh, yes,

Baxter --

(a glance at his

associates; then

continues, as though

it were a business call)

What's your problem? -- Wednesday

is out? -- oh -- that throws a

little monkey wrench into my

agenda -- Thursday? No, I'm all

tied up on Thursday -- let's

schedule that meeting for Friday.

BUD

Friday?

(checks calendar)

Let me see what I can do. I'll get

back to you.

KIRKEBY

Premium-wise and billing-wise, we

are eighteen percent ahead of last

year, October-wise.

KIRKEBY

Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

BUD

Instead of Friday -- could you

possibly switch to Thursday? You'd

be doing me a great favor --

KIRKEBY

Well -- it's all right with me, Bud.

Let me check. I'll get back to you.

SYLVIA

Consolidated Life -- I'll connect

you -- Consolidated Life --

SWITCHBOARD GIRL

Sylvia -- it's for you.

SYLVIA

Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home

all right -- you owe me forty-five

cents.

KIRKEBY

Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead

of Friday - could we make it

Thursday night?

SYLVIA

Thursday? That's The Untouchables --

with Bob Stack.

KIRKEBY

Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll

watch it at the apartment. Big deal.

(he hangs up, dials)

Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.

BUD

Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.

(hangs up, consults

directory, dials)

Mr. Eichelberger? It's okay for

Friday.

(hangs up, consults

directory, dials)

Mr. Vanderhof? It's okay for

Wednesday.

MOFFETT

(into phone)

All right -- I'll tell him.

(hangs up, turns to Bud)

Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel.

Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

BUD

Sheldrake?

MOFFETT

She's been trying to reach you for

the last twenty minutes. They want

you up stairs.

BUD

Oh!

MOFFETT

What gives, Baxter? You getting

promoted or getting fired?

BUD

(cockily)

Care to make a small wager?

MOFFETT

I've been here twice as long as you

have --

BUD

Shall we say -- a dollar?

MOFFETT

It's a bet.

FRAN

Going up?

BUD

Twenty-seven, please. And drive

carefully. You're carrying precious

cargo -- I mean, manpower-wise.

FRAN

Twenty-seven.

BUD

You may not realize it, Miss

Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten --

efficiency-wise and this may be the

day -- promotion-wise.

FRAN

You're beginning to sound like Mr.

Kirkeby already.

BUD

Why not? Now that they're kicking

me upstairs --

FRAN

Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

(Bud beams)

You know, you're the only one

around here who ever takes his hat

off in the elevator.

BUD

Really?

FRAN

The characters you meet. Something

happens to men in elevators. Must

be the change of altitude -- the

blood rushes to their head, or

something -- boy, I could tell you

stories --

BUD

I'd love to hear them. Maybe we

could have lunch in the cafeteria

sometime -- or some evening, after

work --

FRAN

Twenty-seven.

FRAN

I hope everything goes all right.

BUD

I hope so.

(turning back)

Wouldn't you know they'd call me on

a day like this -- with my cold and

everything --

(fumbling with his tie)

How do I look?

FRAN

Fine.

(stepping out of elevator)

Wait.

BUD

Thank you. That's the first thing I

ever noticed about you -- when you

were still on the local elevator --

you always wore a flower --

FRAN

Good luck. And wipe your nose.

BUD

C. C. Baxter -- Ordinary Premium

Accounting -- Mr. Sheldrake called

me.

MISS OLSEN

I called you -- that is, I tried to

call you -- for twenty minutes.

BUD

I'm sorry, I --

MISS OLSEN

Go on in.

SHELDRAKE

Baxter?

BUD

Yes, sir.

SHELDRAKE

(studying him)

I was sort of wondering what you

looked like. Sit down.

BUD

Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

SHELDRAKE

Been hearing some very nice things

about you -- here's a report from

Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative,

resourceful --

BUD

Mr. Dobisch said that?

SHELDRAKE

And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that

several nights a week you work late

at the office -- without overtime.

BUD

(modestly)

Well, you know how it is -- things

pile up.

SHELDRAKE

Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations,

and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage

and Loan -- they'd both like to

have you transferred to their

departments.

BUD

That's very flattering.

SHELDRAKE

Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it

that makes you so popular?

BUD

I don't know.

SHELDRAKE

Think.

BUD

Would you mind repeating the

question?

SHELDRAKE

Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I

know everything that goes on in

this building -- in every

department -- on every floor --

every day of the year.

BUD

(in a very small voice)

You do?

SHELDRAKE

(rises, starts pacing)

In 1957, we had an employee here,

name of Fowler. He was very popular,

too. Turned out he was running a

bookie joint right in the Actuarial

Department tying up the switchboard,

figuring the odds on our I.B.M.

machines -- so the day before the

Kentucky Derby, I called in the

Vice Squad and we raided the

thirteenth floor.

BUD

(worried)

The Vice Squad?

SHELDRAKE

That's right, Baxter.

BUD

What -- what's that got to do with

me? I'm not running any bookie joint.

SHELDRAKE

What kind of joint are you running?

BUD

Sir?

SHELDRAKE

There's a certain key floating

around the office -- from Kirkeby

to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to

Dobisch -- it's the key to a

certain apartment -- and you know

who that apartment belongs to?

BUD

Who?

SHELDRAKE

Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C.

C. Baxter.

BUD

Oh.

SHELDRAKE

Are you going to deny it?

BUD

No, sir. I'm not going to deny it.

But if you'd just let me explain --

SHELDRAKE

You better.

BUD

(a deep breath)

Well, about six months ago -- I was

going to night school, taking this

course in Advanced Accounting --

and one of the guys in our

department -- he lives in Jersey --

he was going to a banquet at the

Biltmore -- his wife was meeting

him in town, and he needed someplace

to change into a tuxedo -- so I

gave him the key    and word must

have gotten around -- because the

next thing I knew, all sorts of

guys were suddenly going to

banquets -- and when you give the

key to one guy, you can't say no to

another and the whole thing got out

of hand -- pardon me.

SHELDRAKE

Baxter, an insurance company is

founded on public trust. Any

employee who conducts himself in a

manner unbecoming --

(shifting into a new gear)

How many charter members are there

in this little club of yours?

BUD

Just those four -- out of a total

of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be

very proud of our personnel --

percentage-wise.

SHELDRAKE

That's not the point. Four rotten

apples in a barrel -- no matter how

large the barrel -- you realize

that if this ever leaked out --

BUD

Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's

not going to happen again. From now

on, nobody is going to use my

apartment --

SHELDRAKE

Where is your apartment?

BUD

West 67th Street. You have no idea

what I've been going through --

with the neighbors and the landlady

and the liquor and the key --

SHELDRAKE

How do you work it with the key?

BUD

Well, usually I slip it to them in

the office and they leave it under

the mat -- but never again -- I can

promise you that --

SHELDRAKE

Yes, Miss Olsen.

MISS OLSEN

Mrs. Sheldrake returning your

call -- on two --

SHELDRAKE

Yes, dear -- I called you earlier --

where were you? Oh, you took Tommy

to the dentist --

SHELDRAKE

(turning to him)

Where are you going, Baxter?

BUD

Well, I don't want to intrude --

and I thought -- since it's all

straightened out anyway --

SHELDRAKE

I'm not through with you yet.

BUD

Yes, sir.

SHELDRAKE

(into phone)

The reason I called is -- I won't

be home for dinner tonight. The

branch manager from Kansas City is

in town -- I'm taking him to the

theatre Music Man, what else? No,

don't wait up for me -- 'bye,

darling.

(hangs up, turns to Bud)

Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have

you seen Music Man?

BUD

Not yet. But I hear it's one swell

show.

SHELDRAKE

How would you like to go tonight?

BUD

You mean -- you and me? I thought

you were taking the branch manager

from Kansas City --

SHELDRAKE

I made other plans. You can have

both tickets.

BUD

Well, that's very kind of you --

only I'm not feeling well -- you

see, I have this cold -- and I

thought I'd go straight home.

SHELDRAKE

Baxter, you're not reading me. I

told you I have plans.

BUD

So do I -- I'm going to take four

aspirins and get into bed -- so you

better give the tickets to somebody

else --

SHELDRAKE

I'm not just giving those tickets,

Baxter -- I want to swap them.

BUD

Swap them? For what?

SHELDRAKE

It also says here -- that you are

alert, astute, and quite

imaginative --

BUD

Oh?

(the dawn is breaking)

Oh!

BUD

This?

SHELDRAKE

That's good thinking, Baxter. Next

month there's going to be a shift

in personnel around here -- and as

far as I'm concerned, you're

executive material.

BUD

I am?

SHELDRAKE

Now put down the key --

(pushing a pad toward him)

-- and put down the address.

BUD

It's on the second floor - my name

is not on the door -- it just says

2A --

BUD

Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that

cold --

SHELDRAKE

Relax, Baxter.

BUD

Thank you, sir.

BUD

You'll be careful with the record

player, won't you? And about the

liquor -- I ordered some this

morning -- but I'm not sure when

they'll deliver it --

SHELDRAKE

Now remember, Baxter -- this is

going to be our little secret.

BUD

Yes, of course.

SHELDRAKE

You know how people talk.

BUD

Oh, you don't have to worry --

SHELDRAKE

Not that I have anything to hide.

BUD

Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway,

it's none of my business -- four

apples, five apples -- what's the

difference -- percentage-wise?

SHELDRAKE

(holding out the tickets)

Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice

time.

BUD

You too, sir.

DISSOLVE TO:

SYLVIA

So I figure, a man in his position,

he's going to take me to 21 and El

Morocco -- instead, he takes me to

Hamburg Heaven and some schnook's

apartment --

FRAN

(passing Bud)

Good night.

BUD

(casually)

Good night.

BUD

Oh -- Miss Kubelik.

(he rushes after her,

taking off his hat)

I've been waiting for you.

FRAN

You have?

BUD

I almost didn't recognize you --

this is the first time I've ever

seen you in civilian clothes.

FRAN

How'd you make out on the twenty-

seventh floor?

BUD

Great. Look -- have you seen The

Music Man?

FRAN

No.

BUD

Would you like to?

FRAN

Sure.

BUD

I thought maybe we could have a

bite to eat first -- and then --

FRAN

You mean tonight?

BUD

Yeah.

FRAN

I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm

meeting somebody.

BUD

Oh.

(a beat)

You mean -- like a girl-friend?

FRAN

No. Like a man.

BUD

I wasn't trying to be personal --

it's just that the fellows in the

office were -- whether you wondering

about you ever --

FRAN

Just tell 'em -- now and then.

BUD

This date -- is it just a date --

or is it something serious?

FRAN

It used to be serious -- at least I

was -- but he wasn't -- so the

whole thing is more or less kaputt.

BUD

Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?

FRAN

I'm afraid not. I promised to have

a drink with him -- he's been

calling me all week --

BUD

Oh, I understand.

BUD

(putting his hat on)

Well, it was just an idea -- I hate

to see a ticket go to waste --

FRAN

(stops)

What time does the show go on?

BUD

Eight-thirty.

FRAN

(looks at her watch)

Well -- I could meet you at the

theatre -- if that's all right.

BUD

All right? That's wonderful! It's

the Majestic -- 44th Street.

FRAN

Meet you in the lobby. Okay?

BUD

You know, I felt so lousy this

morning -- a hundred and one

fever -- then my promotion came

up -- now you and I -- eleventh row

center -- and you said I should

have stayed in bed.

FRAN

How is your cold?

BUD

(high as a kite)

What cold? And after the show, we

could go out on the town --

(does a little cha

cha step)

I've been taking from Arthur Murray.

FRAN

So I see.

BUD

They got a great little band at El

Chico, in the Village -- it's

practically around the corner from

where you live.

FRAN

Sounds good.

(a sudden thought)

How do you know where I live?

BUD

Oh, I even know who you live

with -- your sister and brother-in-

law -- I know when you were born --

and where -- I know all sorts of

things about you.

FRAN

How come?

BUD

A couple of months ago I looked up

your card in the group insurance

file.

FRAN

Oh.

BUD

I know your height, your weight and

your Social Security number -- you

had mumps, you had measles, and you

had your appendix out.

FRAN

Well, don't tell the fellows in the

office about the appendix. They may

get the wrong idea how you found

out.

(turning the corner)

'Bye.

BUD

(calling after her)

Eight-thirty!

FRAN

(a wistful smile)

Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.

SHELDRAKE

Please, Fran -- not so loud.

(he gets up)

FRAN

Still afraid somebody may see us

together?

SHELDRAKE

(reaching for her coat)

Let me take that.

FRAN

No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

(sits opposite him,

with her coat on)

Can I have a frozen daiquiri?

SHELDRAKE

It's on the way.

(sits down)

I see you went ahead and cut your

hair.

FRAN

That's right.

SHELDRAKE

You know I liked it better long.

FRAN

Yes, I know. You want a lock to

carry in your wallet?

WAITER

(showing all his teeth)

Evening, lady. Nice see you again.

FRAN

Thank you.

SHELDRAKE

How long has it been -- a month?

FRAN

Six weeks. But who's counting?

SHELDRAKE

I missed you, Fran.

FRAN

Like old times. Same booth, same

song --

SHELDRAKE

It's been hell.

FRAN

(dipping shrimp)

-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.

SHELDRAKE

You don't know what it's like --

standing next to you in that

elevator, day after day -- Good

morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good

night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still

crazy about you, Fran.

FRAN

(avoiding his eyes)

Let's not start on that again,

Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning

to get over it.

SHELDRAKE

I don't believe you.

FRAN

Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful

months this summer -- and that was

it. Happens all the time -- the

wife and kids go away to the

country, and the boss has a fling

with the secretary or the

manicurist -- or the elevator girl.

Comes September, the picnic is

over -- goodbye. The kids go back

to school, the boss goes back to

the wife, and the girl --

(she is barely able

to control herself)

They don't make these shrimp like

they used to.

SHELDRAKE

I never said goodbye, Fran.

FRAN

(not listening)

For a while there, you try kidding

yourself that you're going with an

unmarried man. Then one day he

keeps looking at his watch, and

asks you if there's any lipstick

showing, then rushes off to catch

the seven-fourteen to White Plains.

So you fix yourself a cup of

instant coffee -- and you sit there

by yourself -- and you think -- and

it all begins to look so ugly --

SHELDRAKE

How do you think I felt -- riding

home on that seven-fourteen train?

FRAN

Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?

What do you want from me?

SHELDRAKE

(taking her hand)

I want you back, Fran.

FRAN

(withdrawing her hand)

Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up.

You'll have to take the next

elevator.

SHELDRAKE

You're not giving me a chance, Fran.

I asked you to meet me because -- I

have something to tell you.

FRAN

Go ahead -- tell me.

SHELDRAKE

(a glance around)

Not here, Fran. Can't we go some

place else?

FRAN

No. I have a date at eight-thirty.

SHELDRAKE

Important?

FRAN

Not very -- but I'm going to be

there anyway.

WAITER

You ready order dinner now?

FRAN

No. No dinner.

SHELDRAKE

Bring us two more drinks.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SHELDRAKE

Fran -- remember that last weekend

we had?

FRAN

(wryly)

Do I. That leaky little boat you

rented -- and me in a black negligee

and a life preserver --

SHELDRAKE

Remember what we talked about?

FRAN

We talked about a lot of things.

SHELDRAKE

I mean -- about my getting a divorce.

FRAN

We didn't talk about it -- you did.

SHELDRAKE

You didn't really believe me, did

you?

FRAN

(shrugging)

They got it an a long playing

record now - Music to String Her

Along By. My wife doesn't understand

me -- We haven't gotten along for

years -- You're the best thing that

ever happened to me --

SHELDRAKE

That's enough, Fran.

FRAN

(going right on)

Just trust me, baby -- we'll work

it out somehow --

SHELDRAKE

You're not being funny.

FRAN

I wasn't trying.

SHELDRAKE

If you'll just listen to me for a

minute --

FRAN

Okay. I'm sorry.

SHELDRAKE

I saw my lawyer this morning -- I

wanted his advice  -- about the

best way to handle it --

FRAN

Handle what?

SHELDRAKE

What do you think?

FRAN

(looking at him for a

long moment - then)

Let's get something straight,

Jeff -- I never asked you to leave

your wife.

SHELDRAKE

Of course not. You had nothing to

do with it.

FRAN

(her eyes misting up again)

Are you sure that's what you want?

SHELDRAKE

I'm sure. If you'll just tell me

that you still love me --

FRAN

(softly)

You know I do.

SHELDRAKE

Fran --

FRAN

(pulling her hand

away gently)

Jeff -- darling --

SHELDRAKE

It is crowding up. Let's get out of

here.

SHELDRAKE

(to a passing cab)

Taxi!

FRAN

I have that date -- remember?

SHELDRAKE

I love you -- remember?

FRAN

Where are we going, Jeff? Not back

to that leaky boat --

SHELDRAKE

I promise.

SHELDRAKE

51 West Sixty-Seventh.

DISSOLVE TO:

BUD

(to painter)

Would you mind --?

(the painter turns around)

C. C. Baxter -- that's me.

KIRKEBY'S VOICE

Hi, Buddy-boy.

DOBISCH'S VOICE

Congratulations, and all that jazz.

BUD

Hi, fellas.

EICHELBERGER

Well, you made it, kid -- just like

we promised.

VANDERHOF

Quite an office -- name on the

door -- rug on the floor -- the

whole schmear.

BUD

Yeah.

DOBISCH

Teamwork -- that's what counts in

an organization like this. All for

one and one for all -- know what I

mean?

BUD

I have a vague idea.

KIRKEBY

Baxter, we're a little disappointed

in you -- gratitude-wise.

BUD

Oh, I'm very grateful.

EIGHELBERGER

Then why are you locking us out,

all of a sudden?

BUD

It's been sort of rough these last

few weeks -- what with my cold and

like that --

DOBISCH

We went to bat for you -- and now

you won't play ball with us.

BUD

Well, after all, it's my

apartment -- it's private

property -- it's not a public

playground.

VANDERHOF

All right, so you got yourself a

girl -- that's okay with us -- but

not every night of the week.

KIRKEBY

How selfish can you get?

(to the others)

Last week I had to borrow my

nephew's car and take Sylvia to a

drive-in in Jersey. I'm too old for

that sort of thing -- I mean, in a

Volkswagen.

BUD

I sympathize with your problem --

and believe me, I'm very sorry --

DOBISCH

You'll be a lot sorrier before

we're through with you.

BUD

You threatening me?

DOBISCH

Listen, Baxter, we made you and we

can break you.

BUD

Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.

SHELDRAKE

Morning, gentlemen.

(to Bud)

Everything satisfactory? You like

your office?

BUD

Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want

to thank you --

SHELDRAKE

Don't thank me -- thank your

friends here -- they're the ones

who recommended you.

DOBISCH

We just dropped in to wish him the

best.

(quickly brushes

cigar ash off desk)

KIRKEBY

(as they move toward

the door)

So long, Baxter. We know you won't

let us down.

BUD

So long, fellas. Drop in any time.

The door is always open -- to my

office.

SHELDRAKE

I like the way you handled that.

Well, how does it feel to be an

executive?

BUD

Fine. And I want you to know I'll

work very hard to justify your

confidence in me --

SHELDRAKE

Sure you will.

(a beat)

Say, Baxter, about the apartment -

now that you got a raise, don't you

think we can afford a second key?

BUD

Well -- I guess so.

SHELDRAKE

You know my secretary -- Miss

Olsen --

BUD

Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she --

the lucky one?

SHELDRAKE

No, you don't understand. She's a

busybody -- always poking her nose

into things -- and with that key

passing back and forth -- why take

chances?

BUD

Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.

BUD

I have something here -- I think it

belongs to you.

SHELDRAKE

To me?

BUD

I mean -- the young lady -- whoever

she may be -- it was on the couch

when I got home last night.

SHELDRAKE

Oh, yes. Thanks.

BUD

The mirror is broken.

(opens compact,

revealing crack in mirror)

It was broken when I found it.

SHELDRAKE

So it was.

(takes the compact)

She threw it at me.

BUD

Sir?

SHELDRAKE

You know how it is -- sooner or

later they all give you a bad time.

BUD

(man-of-the-world)

I know how it is.

SHELDRAKE

You see a girl a couple of times a

week -- just for laughs -- and

right away she thinks you're going

to divorce your wife. I ask you --

is that fair?

BUD

No, sir. That's very unfair --

especially to your wife.

SHELDRAKE

Yeah.

(shifting gears)

You know, Baxter, I envy you.

Bachelor -- all the dames you

want -- no headaches, no

complications --

BUD

Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.

SHELDRAKE

Put me down for Thursday again.

BUD

Roger. And I'll get that other key.

Yeah? -- YEAH? -- Where? -- You

SYLVIA

Somebody watch my line -- there's a

swinging party up on the nineteenth

floor --

SYLVIA

(to a colleague)

-- so I said to him: Never again! --

either get yourself a bigger car or

a smaller girl --

BUD

Miss Kubelik.

BUD

(holding out one of

the drinks)

Marry Christmas.

FRAN

Thank you.

(takes drink)

I thought you were avoiding me.

BUD

What gave you that idea?

FRAN

In the last six weeks you've only

been in my elevator once -- and

then you didn't take your hat off.

BUD

Well, as a matter of fact, I was

rather hurt when you stood me up

that night --

FRAN

I don't blame you. It was

unforgivable.

BUD

I forgive you.

FRAN

You shouldn't.

BUD

You couldn't help yourself. I mean,

when you're having a drink with one

man, you can't just suddenly walk

out on him because you have another

date with another man. You did the

only decent thing.

FRAN

Don't be too sure. Just because I

wear a uniform -- that doesn't make

me a Girl Scout.

BUD

Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be

a second administrative assistant

around here unless he's a pretty

good judge of character -- and as

far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

I mean, decency-wise -- and

otherwise-wise.

(toasting)

Cheers.

FRAN

Cheers.

BUD

One more?

FRAN

(indicating elevator)

I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.

BUD

You're so right.

BUD

By the power vested in me, I

herewith declare this elevator out

of order.

(leading her toward

the party)

Shall we join the natives?

FRAN

Why not?

(as they pass a

kissing couple)

They seem friendly enough.

BUD

Don't you believe it. Later on

there will be human sacrifices --

white collar workers tossed into

the computing machines, and punched

full of those little square holes.

FRAN

How many of those drinks did you

have?

BUD

(holding up four fingers)

Three.

FRAN

I thought so.

BUD

You wait here. I think I hear the

sound of running water.

MISS OLSEN

Hi. How's the branch manager from

Kansas City?

FRAN

I beg your pardon?

MISS OLSEN

I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's

secretary.

FRAN

Yes, I know.

MISS OLSEN

So you don't have to play innocent

with me. He used to tell his wife

that I was the branch manager from

Seattle -- four years ago when we

were having a little ring-a-ding-

ding.

FRAN

I don't know what you're talking

about.

MISS OLSEN

And before me there was Miss Rossi

in Auditing -- and after me there

was Miss Koch in Disability -- and

just before you there was Miss

What's-Her-Name, on the twenty-

fifth floor --

FRAN

(wanting to get away)

Will you excuse me?

MISS OLSEN

(holding her by the arm)

What for? You haven't done

anything -- it's him -- what a

salesman -- always the last booth

in the Chinese restaurant -- and

the same pitch about divorcing his

wife -- and in the end you wind up

with egg foo yong on your face.

BUD

Miss Kubelik.

FRAN

Well -- thank you.

MISS OLSEN

Always happy to do something for

our girls in uniform.

BUD

You all right? What's the matter?

FRAN

Nothing.

(takes the drink)

There are just too many people here.

BUD

Why don't we step into any office?

There's something I want your

advice about, anyway.

(leads her toward his cubicle)

I have my own office now, naturally.

And you may be interested to know

I'm the second youngest executive

in the company -- the only one

younger is a grandson of the

chairman of the board.

BUD

Miss Kubelik, I would like your

honest opinion. I've had this in my

desk for a week -- cost me fifteen

dollars -- but I just couldn't get

up enough nerve to wear it --

BUD

It's what they call the junior

executive model. What do you think?

BUD

Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

FRAN

(paying attention again)

No -- I like it.

BUD

Really? You mean you wouldn't be

ashamed to be seen with somebody in

a hat like this?

FRAN

Of course not.

BUD

Maybe if I wore it a little more to

the side --

(adjusting hat)

is that better?

FRAN

Much better.

BUD

Well, as long as you wouldn't be

ashamed to be seen with me -- how

about the three of us going out

this evening -- you and me and the

bowler -- stroll down Fifth

Avenue -- sort of break it in --

FRAN

This is a bad day for me.

BUD

I understand. Christmas -- family

and all that --

FRAN

I'd better get back to my elevator.

I don't want to be fired.

BUD

Oh, you don't have to worry about

that. I have quite a bit of

influence in Personnel. You know Mr.

Sheldrake?

FRAN

(guardedly)

Why?

BUD

He and I are like this.

(crosses his fingers)

Sent me a Christmas card. See?

SEASON'S GREETINGS

from the SHELDRAKES

Emily, Jeff, Tommy, Jeff Jr.,

and Figaro.

FRAN

(studying the card ruefully)

Makes a cute picture.

BUD

I thought maybe I could put in a

word for you with Mr. Sheldrake --

get you a little promotion -- how

would you like to be an elevator

starter?

FRAN

I'm afraid there are too many other

girls around here with seniority

over me.

BUD

No problem. Why don't we discuss it

sometime over the holidays -- I

could call you and pick you up and

we'll have the big unveiling --

(touching the brim of

his bowler)

-- you sure this is the right way

to wear it?

FRAN

I think so.

BUD

You don't think it's tilted a

little too much --

FRAN

Here.

BUD

(examining himself in

the mirror)

After all, this is a conservative

firm -- I don't want people to

think I'm an entertainer --

FRAN

What is it?

BUD

(with difficulty)

The mirror -- it's broken.

FRAN

I know. I like it this way -- makes

me look the way I feel.

FRAN

Your phone.

BUD

Oh.

(picks up phone from desk)

Yes?

(throws a quick look

at Fran)

Just a minute.

(covers mouthpiece;

to Fran)

If you don't mind -- this is sort

of personal

FRAN

All right. Have a nice Christmas.

BUD

(every word hurts)

Yes, Mr. Sheldrake -- no, I didn't

forget -- the tree is up and the

Tom and Jerry mix is in the

refrigerator -- yes, sir -- same to

you.

KIRKEBY

Where you going, Buddy-boy? The

party's just starting.

(catching up with him)

Listen, kid -- give me a break,

will you -- how about tomorrow

afternoon? I can't take her to that

drive-in again -- the car doesn't

even have a heater four o'clock --

okay?

DISSOLVE TO:

SANTA CLAUS

You buy me a drink, I'll buy you

Rum Collins.

BUD

Rum Collins.

(indicating martini glass)

And another one of these little

mothers.

MARGIE

(out of nowhere)

You like Castro?

(a blank look from Bud)

I mean -- how do you feel about

Castro?

BUD

What is Castro?

MARGIE

You know, that big-shot down in

Cuba with the crazy beard.

BUD

What about him?

MARGIE

Because as far as I'm concerned,

he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago

I wrote him a letter -- never even

answered me.

BUD

That so.

MARGIE

All I wanted him to do was let

Mickey out for Christmas.

BUD

Who is Mickey?

MARGIE

My husband. He's in Havana -- in

jail.

BUD

Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?

MARGIE

Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like

that. He's a jockey. They caught

him doping a horse.

BUD

Well, you can't win 'em all.

MARGIE

(to herself)

'Twas the night before Christmas

And all through the house

Not a creature was stirring --

Nothing --

No action --

Dullsville!

(drinks; to Bud)

You married?

BUD

No.

MARGIE

Family?

BUD

No.

MARGIE

A night like this, it sort of

spooks you to walk into an empty

apartment.

BUD

I said I had no family -- I didn't

say I had an empty apartment.

CUT TO:

SHELDRAKE

(stops and faces Fran)

Come on, Fran -- don't be like that.

You just going to sit there and

keep bawling?

(no answer)

You won't talk to me, you won't

tell me what's wrong --

(a new approach)

Look, I know you think I'm stalling

you. But when you've been married

to a woman for twelve years, you

don't just sit down at the breakfast

table and say "Pass the sugar --

and I want a divorce." It's not

that easy.

(he resumes pacing;

Fran continues crying)

Anyway, this is the wrong time. The

kids are home from school -- my in-

laws are visiting for the

holidays -- I can't bring it up now.

(stops in front of her)

This isn't like you, Fran -- you

were always such a good sport --

such fun to be with --

FRAN

(through tears)

Yeah -- that's me. The Happy

Idiot -- a million laughs.

SHELDRAKE

Well, that's more like it. At least

you're speaking to me.

FRAN

Funny thing happened to me at the

office party today -- I ran into

your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You

know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed

so much I like to died.

SHELDRAKE

Is that what's been bothering

you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient

history.

FRAN

I was never very good at history.

Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen,

and then there was Miss Rossi --

no, she came before -- it was Miss

Koch who came after Miss Olsen --

SHELDRAKE

Now, Fran --

FRAN

And just think -- right now there's

some lucky girl in the building

who's going to come after me --

SHELDRAKE

Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that.

But just ask yourself -- why does a

man run around with a lot of girls?

Because he's unhappy at home --

because he's lonely, that's why --

all that was before you, Fran --

I've stopped running.

FRAN

How could I be so stupid? You'd

think I would have learned by

now -- when you're in love with a

married man, you shouldn't wear

mascara.

SHELDRAKE

It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's

not fight.

FRAN

Merry Christmas.

SHELDRAKE

What is it?

SHELDRAKE

Oh. Our friend from the Chinese

restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better

keep it here.

FRAN

Yeah, we better.

SHELDRAKE

I have a present for you. I didn't

quite know what to get you --

anyway it's a little awkward for

me, shopping --

(he has taken out a

money clip, detaches

a bill)

-- so here's a hundred dollars --

go out and buy yourself something.

SHELDRAKE

They have some nice alligator bags

at Bergdorf's --

SHELDRAKE

Fran, it's a quarter to seven --

and I mustn't miss the train -- if

we hadn't wasted all that time -- I

have to get home and trim the

tree --

FRAN

Okay.

(shrugs the coat back on)

I just thought as long as it was

paid for --

SHELDRAKE

(an angry step toward her)

Don't ever talk like that, Fran!

Don't make yourself out to be cheap.

FRAN

A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call

that cheap. And you must be paying

somebody something for the use of

the apartment --

SHELDRAKE

(grabbing her arms)

Stop that, Fran.

FRAN

(quietly)

You'll miss your train, Jeff.

SHELDRAKE

Coming?

FRAN

You run along -- I want to fix my

face.

SHELDRAKE

(heading for the door)

Don't forget to kill the lights.

See you Monday.

FRAN

Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and

Monday again -- and Thursday

again --

SHELDRAKE

(that stops him in

the half-open door)

It won't always be like this.

(coming back)

I love you, Fran.

FRAN

(turning her head)

Careful -- lipstick.

DISSOLVE TO:

BARTENDER

(to Santa Claus)

Drink up, Pop. It's closing time.

SANTA CLAUS

But it's early, Charlie.

BARTENDER

Don't you know what night this is?

SANTA CLAUS

I know, Charlie. I know. I work for

the outfit.

BARTENDER

Hey, knock it off, will you? Go home.

BARTENDER

O-U-T -- out!

MARGIE

Where do we go -- my place or yours?

BUD

(peering at his watch)

Might as well go to mine --

everybody else does.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARGIE

Poor Mickey -- when I think of him

all by himself in that jail in

Havana --

(opening her handbag)

-- want to see his picture?

BUD

(from steps)

Not particularly.

MARGIE

He's so cute -- five-foot-two --

ninety-nine pounds...like a little

chihuahua.

MARGIE

Can I ask you a personal question?

BUD

No.

MARGIE

You got a girl-friend?

BUD

She may be a girl -- but she's no

friend of mine.

MARGIE

Still stuck on her, huh.

BUD

Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't

know me very well.

MARGIE

I don't know you at all.

BUD

Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior

executive, Arthur Murray graduate,

lover.

MARGIE

I'm Mrs. MacDougall -- Margie to you.

BUD

This way, Mrs. MacDougall.

MARGIE

(looking around)

Say, this is Snugsville.

BUD

(helping her out of

her coat)

Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only

fair to warn you that you are now

alone with a notorious sexpot.

MARGIE

(a gleam)

No kidding.

BUD

Ask anybody around here. As a

matter of fact, when it's time for

me to go -- and I may go just like

that --

(snaps his fingers)

-- I have promised my body to the

Columbia Medical Center.

MARGIE

(shuddering deliciously)

Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps

just to think about it.

BUD

Well, they haven't got me yet, baby.

Dig up some ice from the kitchen

and let's not waste any time --

preliminary-wise.

MARGIE

I'm with you, lover.

BUD

All right, Miss Kubelik -- get up.

It's past checking-out time, and

the hotel management would

appreciate it if you would get the

hell out of here.

(Fran doesn't stir)

Look, Miss Kubelik, I used to like

you -- I used to like you a lot --

but it's all over between us -- so

beat it -- O-U-T -- out!

(no reaction; he puts

a hand on her

shoulder, shakes her)

Come on -- wake up!

BUD

(a hoarse whisper)

Oh, my God.

BUD

Miss Kubelik! Miss Kubelik!

MARGIE

I broke a nail trying to get the

ice-tray out. You ought to buy

yourself a new refrigerator.

MARGIE

(calling after him)

I didn't mean right now.

BUD

Dr. Dreyfuss! Hey, Doc!

BUD

(words tumbling over

each other)

There's a girl in my place -- she

took some sleeping pills -- you

better come quick -- I can't wake

her up.

DR. DREYFUSS

Let me get my bag.

BUD

Hurry up, Doc.

MARGIE

Hey -- over here, lover.

MARGIE

What's all this running around?

You're going to wear yourself out.

MARGIE

Not so rough, honey.

BUD

(taking the glass out

of her hand)

Good night.

MARGIE

Good night?

BUD

(thrusting the fur

coat at her)

The party's over.

MARGIE

What's the matter? Did I do

something wrong?

BUD

(easing her toward door)

It's an emergency -- see you some

other time.

BUD

Not this one --

(pointing to the bedroom)

-- in there, Doc.

MARGIE

Say, what's going on here, anyway?

BUD

Nothing.

(propelling her

toward the door)

Just clear out, will you?

MARGIE

(pointing back)

My shoes.

MARGIE

(bitterly)

Some lover you are. Some sexpot!

BUD

Here -- find yourself a phone booth

and call your husband in Havana.

MARGIE

You bet I will. And when I tell him

how you treated me, he'll push your

face in.

(he shoves her

through the open door)

You fink!

BUD

She going to be all right, Doc?

DR. DREYFUSS

How many pills were in that bottle?

BUD

It was half-full -- about a dozen

or so. You going to have to take

her to the hospital?

DR. DREYFUSS

Help me, will you?

DR. DREYFUSS

Into the bathroom.

BUD

What are you going to do, Doc?

DR. DREYFUSS

Get that stuff out of her stomach --

if it isn't too late. You better

put some coffee on -- and pray.

DR. DREYFUSS

Bring my bag.

DR. DREYFUSS

Roll up her right sleeve.

DR. DREYFUSS

Nice veins.

DR. DREYFUSS

Want to tell me what happened?

BUD

I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't

here -- you see -- we had some

words earlier -- nothing serious,

really -- what you might call a

lovers' quarrel --

DR. DREYFUSS

(making off-scene injection)

So you went right out and picked

yourself up another dame.

BUD

Something like that.

DR. DREYFUSS

You know, Baxter, you're a real

cutie-pie -- yes, you are.

DR. DREYFUSS

If you'd come home half an hour

later, you would have had quite a

Christmas present.

DR. DREYFUSS

Get the coffee.

DR. DREYFUSS

Let's get some air in here. Open

the windows.

DR. DREYFUSS

(putting the empty

mug down)

What's her name?

BUD

Miss Kubelik -- Fran.

DR. DREYFUSS

(to Fran, slowly)

Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here

because you took too many sleeping

pills. Do you understand what I'm

saying?

(Fran mutters something)

Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here

to help you. You took all those

sleeping pills -- remember?

FRAN

(mumbling groggily)

Sleeping pills.

DR. DREYFUSS

That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

FRAN

Doctor.

DR. DREYFUSS

Dr. Dreyfuss.

FRAN

Dreyfuss.

DR. DREYFUSS

(to Bud)

Get more coffee.

DR. DREYFUSS

(to Fran)

Tell me again -- what's my name?

FRAN

Dr. Dreyfuss.

DR. DREYFUSS

And what happened to you?

FRAN

I took sleeping pills.

DR. DREYFUSS

Do you know where you are, Fran?

FRAN

(looking around blankly)

No.

DR. DREYFUSS

Yes, you do. Now concentrate.

FRAN

I don't know.

DR. DREYFUSS

(pointing to Bud)

Do you know who this is?

(Fran tries to focus)

Look at him.

FRAN

Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.

BUD

Hello, Miss Kubelik.

DR. DREYFUSS

(to Bud)

Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!

BUD

(to Dr. Dreyfuss, discreetly)

Well -- we work in the same

building -- and we try to keep it

quiet --

FRAN

(to Bud, puzzled)

What are you doing here?

BUD

(to Fran)

Don't you remember? We were at the

office party together --

FRAN

Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss

Olsen --

BUD

That's right.

(to Dr. Dreyfuss;

improvising rapidly)

I told you we had a fight -- that's

what it was about -- Miss Olsen --

you know that other girl you saw --

FRAN

(still trying to

figure out Bud's presence)

I don't understand --

BUD

It's not important, Fran -- the

main thing is that I got here in

time -- and you're going to be all

right --

(to Dr. Dreyfuss)

-- isn't she, Doc?

FRAN

(closing her eyes)

I'm so tired --

DR. DREYFUSS

Here -- drink this.

FRAN

(pushing the mug away)

Please -- just let me sleep.

DR. DREYFUSS

You can't sleep.

(shaking her)

Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.

(to Bud)

Let's get her walking. We've got to

keep her awake for the next couple

of hours.

DR. DREYFUSS

(urging Fran on)

Now walk, Fran. One, two, three,

four -- one, two, three, four --

that's the idea -- left, right,

left, right -- now we turn -- one,

two, three, four --

DR. DREYFUSS

Left, right, left, right -- walk,

walk, walk -- one, two, three,

four -- turn -- left, right, left,

right -- now you got it --

DISSOLVE TO:

DR. DREYFUSS

She'll sleep on and off for the

next twenty-four hours. Of course,

she'll have a dandy hangover when

she wakes up --

BUD

Just as long as she's okay.

DR. DREYFUSS

(massaging his calves)

These cases are harder on the

doctor than on the patient. I ought

to charge you by the mile.

DR. DREYFUSS

Any of that coffee left?

BUD

Sure.

DR. DREYFUSS

How do you spell her last name?

BUD

(from kitchen)

Kubelik -- with two k's.

DR. DREYFUSS

What's her address?

(no answer from Bud)

Where does she live?

BUD

(apprehensive)

Why do you want to know, Doc? You

don't have to report this, do you?

DR. DREYFUSS

It's regulations.

BUD

(setting the coffee down)

She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was

an accident -- she had a little too

much to drink and -- she didn't

know what she was doing -- there

was no suicide note or anything --

believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking

about myself --

DR. DREYFUSS

(sipping the hot coffee)

Aren't you?

BUD

It's just that she's got a family --

and there's the people in the

office -- look, Doc, can't you

forget you're a doctor -- let's

just say you're here as a neighbor --

DR. DREYFUSS

(a long look at Bud)

Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't

prove it wasn't an accident.

(closes notebook)

But as your neighbor, I'd like to

kick your keester clear around the

block.

(indicating coffee)

Mind if I cool this off?

BUD

Help yourself.

DR. DREYFUSS

(taking a big gulp of

the spiked coffee)

I don't know what you did to that

girl in there -- and don't tell

me -- but it was bound to happen,

the way you carry on. Live now, pay

later. Diner's Club!

(another swig)

Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a

mensch! You know what that means?

BUD

I'm not sure.

DR. DREYFUSS

A mansch -- a human being! So you

got off easy this time -- so you

were lucky --

BUD

Yeah, wasn't I?

DR. DREYFUSS

(finishing coffee)

But you're not out of the woods

yet, Baxter -- because most of them

try it again!

(picks up bag, starts

toward door)

You know where I am if you need me.

FADE OUT:

MRS. LIEBERMAN

Mr. Baxter. Open up already!

BUD

Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.

MRS. LIEBERMAN

So who did you think it was -- Kris

Kringle? What was going on here

last night?

BUD

Last night?

MRS. LIEBERMAN

All that marching -- tramp, tramp,

tramp -- you were having army

maneuvers maybe?

BUD

I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and

I'll never invite those people again.

MRS. LIEBERMAN

What you get from renting to

bachelors. All night I didn't sleep

ten minutes -- and I'm sure you

woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.

BUD

Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I

happen to know he was out on a case.

MRS. LIEBERMAN

I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this

is a respectable house, not a

honky-tonky.

(to the dog)

Come on, Oscar.

BUD

(his voice low)

Operator, I want White Plains, New

York -- Mr. J. D. Sheldrake --

(an added thought)

-- make it person to person.

SHELDRAKE

(counting down)

7-6-5-4-3-2-1 -- let her rip!

JEFF JR.

I'll get it.

TOMMY

Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly

in the nose cone and see if we can

bring it back alive?

SHELDRAKE

It's a thought.

TOMMY

Maybe we should send up two flies --

and see if they'll propagate in

orbit.

SHELDRAKE

See if they'll what?

TOMMY

Propagate -- you know, multiply --

baby flies?

SHELDRAKE

Oh -- oh!

JEFF JR.

(coming back from the phone)

It's for you, Dad. A Mr. Baxter.

SHELDRAKE

(getting up)

Baxter?

JEFF JR.

Person to person.

TOMMY

(to Jeff Jr.)

Come on -- help me round up some

flies.

SHELDRAKE

Hello? -- yes -- what's on your

mind, Baxter?

BUD

I hate to disturb you, but something

came up -- it's rather important --

and I think it would be a good idea

if you could see me -- at the

apartment -- as soon as possible.

SHELDRAKE

You're not making sense, Baxter.

What's this all about?

BUD

I didn't want to tell you over the

phone but that certain party -- you

know who I mean -- I found her here

last night -- she had taken an

overdose of sleeping pills.

SHELDRAKE

What?

MRS. SHELDRAKE'S VOICE

What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?

SHELDRAKE

(a nice recovery)

One of our employees had an

accident -- I don't know why they

bother me with these things on

Christmas Day.

(into phone)

Yes, Baxter -- just how serious is

it?

BUD

Well, it was touch and go there for

a while -- but she's sleeping it

off now.

BUD

I thought maybe you'd like to be

here when she wakes up.

SHELDRAKE

That's impossible.

(an apprehensive look

toward the living room)

You'll have to handle this situation

yourself -- as a matter of fact,

I'm counting on you --

BUD

(into phone)

Yes, sir -- I understand.

(taking Fran's letter

out of his pocket)

She left a note -- you want me to

open it and read it to you?

(a beat)

Well, it was just a suggestion --

no, you don't have to worry about

that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your

name out of it so there'll be no

trouble, police-wise or newspaper-

wise --

BUD

(into phone)

-- you see, the doctor, he's a

friend of mine -- we were very

lucky in that respect -- actually,

he thinks she's my girl -- no, he

just jumped to the conclusion --

around here, I'm known as quite a

ladies' man --

BUD

(into phone)

-- of course, we're not out of the

woods yet -- sometimes they try it

again -- yes sir, I'll do my

best -- it looks like it'll be a

couple of days before she's fully

recovered, and I may have a little

problem with the landlady --

BUD

(into phone)

-- all right, Mr. Sheldrake, I'll

keep her in my apartment as long as

I can -- any sort of message you

want me to give her? -- well, I'll

think of something -- goodbye, Mr.

Sheldrake.

FRAN

(weakly)

I'm sorry.

FRAN

I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.

BUD

Miss Kubelik --

(hurries toward her)

-- you shouldn't be out of bed.

FRAN

I didn't know -- I had no idea this

was your apartment --

BUD

(putting his arm

around her)

Let me help you.

FRAN

I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just

let me die?

BUD

What kind of talk is that?

(he lowers her onto

the bed)

So you got a little over-

emotional -- but you're fine now.

FRAN

(a groan)

My head -- it feels like a big wad

of chewing gum. What time is it?

BUD

Two o'clock.

FRAN

(struggling to her feet)

Where's my dress? I have to go home.

BUD

You're in no condition to go

anywhere -- except back to bed.

FRAN

You don't want me here --

BUD

Sure I do. It's always nice to have

company for Christmas.

BUD

Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you

are --

FRAN

I just want to go brush my teeth --

BUD

Oh -- of course. I think there's a

new toothbrush somewhere.

BUD

Here -- put this on.

BUD

(handing her the toothbrush)

Here. How about some breakfast?

FRAN

No -- I don't want anything.

BUD

I'll fix you some coffee.

BUD

Oh -- we're all out of coffee --

you had quite a lot of it last

night --

BUD

Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some

coffee -- and maybe an orange and a

couple of eggs?

MRS. DREYFUSS

(contemptuously)

Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What

you need is a good horse-whipping.

BUD

Ma'am?

MRS. DREYFUSS

From me the doctor has no secrets.

Poor girl -- how could you do a

thing like that?

BUD

I didn't really do anything --

honest -- I mean, you take a girl

out a couple of times a week --

just for laughs -- and right away

she thinks you're serious --

marriage-wise.

MRS. DREYFUSS

Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift

a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a

little something to eat.

BUD

Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?

FRAN

My sister -- she'll want to know

what happened to me.

BUD

(alarmed)

Wait a minute -- let's talk this

over first.

(hurries up to her,

takes the receiver away)

Just what are you going to tell her?

FRAN

Well, I haven't figured it out,

exactly.

BUD

You better figure it out -- exactly.

Suppose she asks you why you didn't

come home last night?

FRAN

I'll tell her I spent the night

with a friend.

BUD

Who?

FRAN

Someone from the office.

BUD

And where are you now?

FRAN

In his apartment.

BUD

His apartment?

FRAN

I mean -- her apartment.

BUD

What's your friend's name?

FRAN

Baxter.

BUD

What's her first name?

FRAN

Miss.

(she is impressed

with her own cleverness)

BUD

When are you coming home?

FRAN

As soon as I can walk.

BUD

Something wrong with your legs?

FRAN

No -- it's my stomach.

BUD

Your stomach?

FRAN

They had to pump it out.

BUD

(hanging up the phone)

Miss Kubelik, I don't think you

ought to call anybody -- not till

that chewing gum is out of your

head.

(leads her into bedroom)

FRAN

But they'll be worried about me --

my brother-in-law may be calling

the police --

BUD

That's why we have to be careful --

we don't want to involve anybody --

after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a

married man --

FRAN

Thanks for reminding me.

BUD

(contritely)

I didn't mean it that way -- I was

just talking to him on the phone --

he's very concerned about you.

FRAN

He doesn't give a damn about me.

BUD

Oh, you're wrong. He told me --

FRAN

He's a liar. But that's not the

worst part of it -- the worst part

is -- I still love him.

BUD

Must be Mrs. Dreyfuss --

(starts into living room)

-- remember the doctor -- from last

night -- that's his wife.

MRS. DREYFUSS

So where is the victim?

(Bud indicates the bedroom)

Max the Knife!

MRS. DREYFUSS

(to Fran)

Nu, little lady, how are we feeling

today?

FRAN

I don't know -- kind of dizzy.

MRS. DREYFUSS

Here. The best thing for dizzy is a

little noodle soup with chicken --

white meat -- and a glass tea.

FRAN

Thank you. I'm really not hungry.

MRS. DREYFUSS

Go ahead! Eat! Enjoy!

MRS. DREYFUSS

You wouldn't have such a thing as a

napkin, would you?

BUD

Well, I have some paper towels --

MRS. DREYFUSS

Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third

drawer, under the good silver,

there is napkins.

BUD

Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

MRS. DREYFUSS

So what are you waiting for -- a

singing commercial?

FRAN

I can't eat.

MRS. DREYFUSS

You must eat -- and you must get

healthy -- and you must forget him.

Such a fine boy he seemed when he

first moved in here -- clean and

cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns

out he is King Farouk. Mit the

drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit

the no napkins. A girl like you,

for the rest of your life you want

to cry in your noodle soup? Who

needs it! You listen to me, you

find yourself a nice, substantial

man -- a widower maybe -- and

settle down -- instead of nashing

all those sleeping pills -- for

what, for whom? -- for some Good

Time Charlie?

(sees Bud approaching

with napkin)

Sssh!

BUD

(gaily)

One napkin, coming up.

(hands it to Fran)

I wish we had some champagne to

wrap it around.

MRS. DREYFUSS

(to Fran)

What did I tell you?

BUD

(uncomfortable)

Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have

to wait around. I'll wash the

dishes and --

MRS. DREYFUSS

You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll

come back for them later.

(to Fran)

If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

FRAN

She doesn't seem to like you very

much.

BUD

Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of

fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that

anybody should think a girl like

you -- would do a thing like

this -- over a guy like me.

FRAN

(glancing at night table)

Oh. Did you find something here --

an envelope -- ?

BUD

Yes, I've got it.

(takes envelope out

of back pocket)

Don't you think we'd better destroy

it? So it won't fall into the wrong

hands -- ?

FRAN

Open it.

BUD

There's nothing here but a hundred

dollar bill.

FRAN

That's right. Will you see that Mr.

Sheldrake gets it?

BUD

(shrugging)

Sure.

FRAN

(holding out tray)

Here -- take this, will you?

BUD

You want me to move the television

set in here?

(Fran shakes her head)

You play gin rummy?

FRAN

I'm not very good at it.

BUD

I am. Let me get the cards.

FRAN

You don't have to entertain me.

BUD

Nothing I'd like better -- you know

togetherness. Guess what I did last

Christmas. Had an early dinner at

the automat, then went to the zoo,

then I came home and cleaned up

after Mr. Eichelberger -- he had a

little eggnog party here. I'm way

ahead this year.

BUD

Three across, spades double, high

deals.

(they cut)

Eight -- ten.

(he starts to deal)

FRAN

(pensively)

I think I'm going to give it all up.

BUD

Give what up?

FRAN

Why do people have to love people,

anyway?

BUD

Yeah -- I know what you mean.

(flips over down card)

Queen.

FRAN

I don't want it.

BUD

Pick a card.

FRAN

What do you call it when somebody

keeps getting smashed up in

automobile accidents?

BUD

A bad insurance risk?

FRAN

(nodding)

That's me with men. I've been

jinxed from the word go -- first

time I was ever kissed was in a

cemetery.

BUD

A cemetery?

FRAN

I was fifteen -- we used to go

there to smoke. His name was

George -- he threw me over for a

drum majorette.

BUD

Gin.

BUD

Thirty-six and twenty-five --

that's sixty-one and two boxes.

(enters score on pad)

FRAN

I just have this talent for falling

in love with the wrong guy in the

wrong place at the wrong time.

BUD

(shuffling)

How many guys were there?

FRAN

(holding up four fingers)

Three. The last one was manager of

a finance company, back home in

Pittsburgh -- they found a little

shortage in his accounts, but he

asked me to wait for him -- he'll

be out in 1965.

BUD

(pushing the deck

toward her)

Cut.

FRAN

(she does, and he

starts dealing)

So I came to New York and moved in

with my sister and her husband --

he drives a cab. They sent me to

secretarial school, and I applied

for a job with Consolidated - but I

flunked the typing test --

BUD

Too slow?

FRAN

Oh. I can type up a storm, but I

can't spell. So they gave me a pair

of white gloves and stuck me in an

elevator -- that's how I met

Jeff --

(her eyes mist up,

and she puts her

cards down)

Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am

I going to do now?

BUD

You better win a hand -- you're on

a blitz.

FRAN

Was he really upset when you told

him?

BUD

Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.

FRAN

Maybe he does love me -- only he

doesn't have the nerve to tell his

wife.

BUD

I'm sure that's the explanation.

FRAN

You really think so?

BUD

No doubt about it.

FRAN

(a thoughtful beat, then)

Can I have that pad and the pencil?

BUD

(handing her score

pad and pencil)

What for?

FRAN

I'm going to write a letter to Mrs.

Sheldrake.

BUD

You are?

FRAN

As one woman to another -- I'm sure

she'll understand --

BUD

Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's

such a good idea.

FRAN

Why not?

BUD

Well, for one thing, you can't

spell. And secondly -- if you did

something like that -- you'd hate

yourself.

FRAN

(fighting back tears)

I don't like myself very much anyway.

BUD

Pick up your cards and let's go.

FRAN

Do I have to?

BUD

You bet. I got a terrific hand.

BUD

You sure you want to throw that card?

FRAN

Sure.

BUD

Gin.

BUD

Fifty-two and twenty-five -- that's

seventy-seven -- spades is double --

a hundred and fifty-four -- and

four boxes -- you're blitzed in two

games.

BUD

(muttering to himself)

All right -- all right, Mrs.

Dreyfuss.

KIRKEBY

Hi, Baxter.

BUD

(blocking the door)

What do you want?

KIRKEBY

What do I -- ?

(to Sylvia)

Just a minute.

BUD

You can't come in.

KIRKEBY

(closing the door

behind him)

What's the matter with you, Buddy-

boy? I made a reservation for four

o'clock, remember?

BUD

Look, you can't stay here. Just

take your champagne and go.

KIRKEBY

Baxter, I don't want to pull rank

on you -- but I told the lady it

was all set -- you want to make a

liar out of me?

BUD

Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby,

or do I have to throw you out?

KIRKEBY

Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?

(indicating dress)

You got yourself a little playmate,

huh?

BUD

Now will you get out?

SYLVIA

(knocking on the door)

Hey, come on, what are we waiting

for? Open up, will you?

DR. DREYFUSS

(calling)

Mildred --  !

SYLVIA

(knocking on Baxter's door)

What's holding things up?

KIRKEBY

Say, why don't we have ourselves a

party -- the four of us?

BUD

No!

KIRKEBY

(grinning smugly)

Well, I don't blame you. So you hit

the jackpot, eh kid -- I mean,

Kubelik-wise?

(Bud opens the door,

gestures him out)

Don't worry. I won't say a word to

anybody.

KIRKEBY

Stay with it, Buddy-boy!

(Bud shuts the door

on him)

Come on, Sylvia.

SYLVIA

What gives?

KIRKEBY

A little mixup in signals. Let's go.

SYLVIA

Go where?

KIRKEBY

(leading her toward stairs)

What's your mother doing this

afternoon?

SYLVIA

She's home -- stuffing a turkey.

KIRKEBY

Why don't we send her to a movie --

like Ben-Hur?

SYLVIA

That's fine. But what are we going

to do about grandma and Uncle

Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two

nieces --

FRAN

Who was that?

BUD

Just somebody delivering a bottle

of champagne. Like some?

FRAN

(shaking her head)

Would you mind opening the window?

BUD

Now don't go getting any ideas,

Miss Kubelik.

FRAN

I just want some fresh air.

BUD

It's only one story down -- the

best you can do is break a leg.

FRAN

So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.

BUD

(approaching the bed)

Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to

promise me you won't do anything

foolish.

FRAN

Who'd care?

BUD

I would.

FRAN

(sleepily)

Why can't I ever fall in love with

somebody nice like you?

BUD

(ruefully)

Yeah. Well -- that's the way it

crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.

FADE OUT:

SECRETARIES

(ad lib)

Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.

SHELDRAKE

(ignoring them)

Miss Olsen, will you come into my

office, please?

MISS OLSEN

Did you have a nice Christmas?

SHELDRAKE

Lovely. You were a big help.

MISS OLSEN

Me?

SHELDRAKE

Thank you for giving that little

pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the

office party.

MISS OLSEN

(dropping her

business-like mask)

I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could

never hold my liquor --

SHELDRAKE

But I thought you could hold your

tongue.

MISS OLSEN

It won't happen again.

SHELDRAKE

You bet it won't. I'll arrange for

you to get a month's severance

pay --

(she looks at him, uncomprehending)

That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm

letting you go.

MISS OLSEN

(quietly)

You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

Only you were cruel enough to make

me sit out there and watch the new

models pass by.

SHELDRAKE

I'd appreciate it if you'd be out

of here as soon as you can.

MISS OLSEN

(formal again)

Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

SHELDRAKE

(into phone)

This is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like Mr.

Baxter's home telephone number --

that's C.C. Baxter, in Ordinary

Premium Accounting --

SHELDRAKE

Hello, Baxter? Jeff Sheldrake. Can

you talk?

BUD

(looking off)

Yes, she's in the shower -- she's

coming along fine, considering.

SHELDRAKE

Good. Is there anything you need --

money -- ?

BUD

No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a

matter of fact, I've got some money

for you -- a hundred dollars --

SHELDRAKE

Oh.

(a beat)

Well, if there's anything I can do

for you --

BUD

For me? I don't think so. But I was

hoping maybe you could do something

for her --

SHELDRAKE

Like what? Put yourself in my

place, Baxter -- how can I help

her -- my hands are tied --

BUD

(into phone)

Well, at least you can talk to

her -- let me put her on -- and

please be gentle --

BUD

There's a call for you --

FRAN

(approaching)

For me?

BUD

-- Mr. Sheldrake.

FRAN

I don't want to talk to him.

BUD

I think you should. I have to run

down to the grocery anyway -- all

that's left around here is one

frozen pizza --

(takes raincoat and

old hat from hanger)

I'll be right back -- okay?

FRAN

(into phone)

Hello, Jeff.

(a long beat)

Yes, I'm all right.

SHELDRAKE

Fran, why did you do it? It's so

childish -- and it never solves

anything -- I ought to be very

angry with you, scaring me like

that -- but let's forget the whole

thing -- pretend it never

happened -- what do you say, Fran?

(no answer)

Fran --

SHELDRAKE

Are you there, Fran?

FRAN

Of course I'm not here -- because

the whole thing never happened -- I

never took those pills -- I never

loved you -- we never even met --

isn't that the way you want it?

SHELDRAKE

There you go again -- you know I

didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just

get well -- do what the nurse tells

you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll

see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran.

(he hangs up)

MISS OLSEN

(into phone)

Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake? This is Miss

Olsen -- fine, thank you -- Mrs.

Sheldrake, I was wondering if we

could have lunch together? -- well,

I don't know how important it is,

but I think you might find it

educational -- it concerns your

husband -- all right, one o'clock,

at Longchamp's, Madison and 59th.

MISS OLSEN

(hanging up phone)

Don't worry, I'm on my way.

(she rises)

I was just making a personal call.

MISS OLSEN

Here's a dime.

DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. LIEBERMAN

(breathlessly)

Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're

here -- I was just going to get the

passkey.

BUD

What for?

MRS. LIEBERMAN

I thought I smelled gas coming from

your apartment.

BUD

Gas?

BUD

(calling)

Miss Kubelik!

BUD

Miss Kubelik!

BUD

Are you all right?

FRAN

Sure.

(sniffs)

What's that funny smell?

BUD

Gas.

(indicating kitchen)

Didn't you turn it on?

FRAN

Yes. I was boiling some water to

get the coffee stains out of my

dress.

BUD

(accusingly)

You turned it on -- but you didn't

light it.

FRAN

Are you supposed to?

BUD

In this house, you're supposed to.

FRAN

Oh.

BUD

What are you doing with that?

FRAN

I was washing my stockings, so I

decided I might as well do your

socks.

BUD

Thank you.

FRAN

It's very curious -- I could only

find three and a half pair.

BUD

Well, things are a little

disorganized around here.

FRAN

I'd say. What's a tennis racquet

doing in the kitchen?

BUD

Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I

was cooking myself an Italian

dinner.

(Fran looks at him oddly)

I used it to strain the spaghetti.

FRAN

(thinking it over)

Why not?

BUD

As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty

good cook -- but I'm a lousy

housekeeper.

FRAN

Yes, you are,

(indicating the

living room)

When I was straightening up the

couch, you know what I found? Six

hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of

false eyelashes, and a swizzle

stick from the Stork Club.

BUD

(shrugging)

It's just that I'm the kind of guy

who can't say no -- I don't mean to

girls -- I mean --

FRAN

You mean to someone like Mr.

Sheldrake.

BUD

I guess so.

FRAN

I know so. He's a taker.

BUD

A what?

FRAN

Some people take, some people get

took -- and they know they're

getting took -- and there's nothing

they can do about it.

BUD

I wouldn't say that --

(trying to change the subject)

What would you like to have for

diner? There's onion soup and

canned asparagus --

FRAN

I really ought to be getting home.

My family will be flipping by now.

BUD

You can't leave yet. The doctor

says it takes forty-eight hours to

get the stuff out of your system.

FRAN

(wistfully)

I wonder how long it takes to get

someone you're stuck on out of your

system? If they'd only invent some

kind of a pump for that --

BUD

I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik.

You think it's the end of the

world -- but it's not, really. I

went through exactly the same thing

myself.

FRAN

You did?

BUD

Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried

to do it with a gun.

FRAN

Over a girl?

BUD

Worse than that -- she was the wife

of my best friend -- and I was mad

for her. But I knew it was

hopeless -- so I decided to end it

all. I went to a pawnshop and

bought a forty-five automatic and

drove up to Eden Park -- do you

know Cincinnati?

FRAN

No, I don't.

BUD

Anyway, I parked the car and loaded

the gun -- well, you read in the

papers all the time that people

shoot themselves, but believe me,

it's not that easy -- I mean, how

do you do it? -- here, or here, or

here --

(with cocked finger,

he points to his

temple, mouth and chest)

-- you know where I finally shot

myself?

FRAN

Where?

BUD

(indicating kneecap)

Here.

FRAN

In the knee?

BUD

Uh-huh. While I was sitting there,

trying to make my mind up, a cop

stuck his head in the car, because

I was illegally parked -- so I

started to hide the gun under the

seat and it went off -- pow!

FRAN

(laughing)

That's terrible.

BUD

Yeah. Took me a year before I could

bend my knee -- but I got over the

girl in three weeks. She still

lives in Cincinnati, has four kids,

gained twenty pounds -- she sends

me a fruit cake every Christmas.

FRAN

(suddenly suspicious)

Are you just making that up to make

me feel better?

BUD

Of course not. Here's the fruit

cake.

(shows it to her

under Christmas tree)

And you want to see my knee?

(starts to raise

pant-leg)

FRAN

No, thanks. The fellows in the

office may get the wrong idea how I

found out.

BUD

So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook

dinner for us. We'll have the fruit

cake for dessert. You just sit

there and rest. You've done enough

for one day.

FRAN

(smiling)

Yes, nurse.

DISSOLVE TO:

ELEVATOR STARTER

Can I help you?

MATUSCHKA

I'm looking for one of the elevator

girls -- Miss Kubelik.

ELEVATOR STARTER

So am I. She didn't report this

morning.

MATUSCHKA

She didn't. Where can I get some

information -- who's in charge here?

ELEVATOR STARTER

That comes under General Office

Administration. See Mr. Dobisch,

twenty-first floor.

MATUSCHKA

Thanks.

KIRKEBY

-- so yesterday afternoon I take

Sylvia up to the apartment, and

guess who he's got stashed away in

the bedroom?

DOBISCH

Who?

KIRKEBY

Kubelik.

DOBISCH

No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik

having themselves a little toot!

KIRKEBY

Toot? It's more like a lost weekend.

Neither of them showed up for work

today.

DOBISCH

A.W.O.L.?

KIRKEBY

What gripes me is the two of them

were guzzling my champagne while

Sylvia and I wound up at the

Guggenheim Museum.

MATUSCHKA

Mr. Dobisch?

DOBISCH

Yeah.

MATUSCHKA

My name is Karl Matuschka -- my

sister-in-law, she runs one of the

elevators here -- Fran Kubelik.

KIRKEBY

(exchanging a glance

with Dobisch)

Miss Kubelik?

MATUSCHKA

You know her?

DOBISCH

Of course. There may be a lot of

employees here -- but we're one big

happy family.

MATUSCHKA

Well, she lives with us -- and my

wife, she's getting a little

nervous -- on account of Fran

hasn't been home for two days.

KIRKEBY

(another look at Dobisch)

That so.

MATUSCHKA

Anyway, we was wondering if somebody

in the office would know what

happened to her.

DOBISCH

I see.

(to Kirkeby)

What do you think, Al? Can we help

the man?

KIRKEBY

(after a pregnant pause)

Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy

anything.

DOBISCH

Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us

lately?

MATUSCHKA

(scowling)

Who is Buddy-boy?

DISSOLVE TO:

FRAN

Are we dressing for dinner?

BUD

No -- just come as you are.

FRAN

(watching him)

Say, you're pretty good with that

racquet.

BUD

You ought to see my backhand.

(dumping spaghetti

into platter)

And wait till I serve the meatballs.

(demonstrates)

FRAN

Shall I light the candles?

BUD

It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.

FRAN

I see you bought some napkins.

BUD

Might as well go all the way.

BUD

You know, I used to live like

Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked

among eight million people. Then

one day I saw a footprint in the

sand -- and there you were --

(hands her martini)

It's a wonderful thing -- dinner

for two.

FRAN

You usually eat alone?

BUD

Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner

with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with

Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the

other night I had dinner with Mae

West -- of course, she was much

younger then.

(toasting)

Cheers.

FRAN

Cheers.

BUD

You know what we're going to do

after dinner?

FRAN

The dishes?

BUD

I mean, after that?

FRAN

What?

BUD

You don't have to if you don't want

to --

FRAN

I don't?

BUD

We're going to finish that gin game.

FRAN

Oh.

BUD

So I want you to keep a clear head.

BUD

Because I don't want to take

advantage of you -- the way I did

yesterday in bed.

MATUSCHKA

Baxter?

BUD

Yes?

MATUSCHKA

What's with you, Fran -- did you

forget where you live?

FRAN

(to Bud)

This is my brother-in-law, Karl

Matuschka.

BUD

(friendly)

How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?

MATUSCHKA

(pushing Bud away; to Fran)

Okay, get your clothes on. I got

the cab downstairs.

BUD

Now, wait a minute. I know what

you're thinking -- but it's not as

bad as it looks --

MATUSCHKA

(shoving him away)

It's none of my business what you

do, Fran -- you're over twenty-

one -- but your sister happens to

think you're a lady.

BUD

All we were going to do is eat and

wash the dishes --

MATUSCHKA

(grabbing him)

Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't

a lady present, I'd clobber you.

FRAN

(separating them)

All right, Karl -- I'll get dressed.

BUD

Care for a martini? Champagne?

(Matuschka continues

glaring at him)

How about a little spaghetti with

meat sauce? Made it myself.

(Matuschka just scowls)

Your sister-in-law sure is

terrific --

(realizes his mistake;

switching abruptly)

Must be murder driving a cab in New

York -- I mean, with all that

cross-town traffic --

DR. DREYFUSS

Hi, Baxter.

DR. DREYFUSS

How's the patient?

BUD

(quickly)

Oh, I'm fine, Doc.

DR. DREYFUSS

Not you -- Miss Kubelik.

MATUSCHKA

(stepping forward)

What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?

BUD

Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's

Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab

downstairs --

MATUSCHKA

(to Dreyfuss)

Fran been sick or something?

BUD

No, no -- just had a little accident.

MATUSCHKA

(to Dreyfuss)

What does he mean, accident?

DR. DREYFUSS

Well, these things happen all the

time --

MATUSCHKA

What things?

(grabbing Dreyfuss)

Say, what kind of doctor are you,

anyway?

BUD

(hastily)

Oh, not that kind. He just gave her

a shot and pumped her stomach out --

MATUSCHKA

What for?

FRAN

(coming up)

Because I took some sleeping pills.

But I'm all right now -- so let's go.

MATUSCHKA

Why did you take sleeping pills?

BUD

(promptly)

On account of me.

MATUSCHKA

(whirling on him)

You?

BUD

Who else?

FRAN

Leave him alone, Karl.

FRAN

(tenderly)

You fool -- you damn fool.

MATUSCHKA

Come on, Fran.

FRAN

Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

FRAN

Goodbye, doctor.

DR. DREYFUSS

I don't want to gloat, but just

between us, you had that coming to

you.

(tilts Bud's chin up,

examines his eye)

Tch, tch, tch. Are you going to

have a shiner tomorrow. Let me get

my bag.

(he starts out)

BUD

(calling after him)

Don't bother, Doc. It doesn't hurt

a bit.

FADE OUT:

BUD

(into phone)

Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is C.C.

Baxter. Would you please tell Mr.

Sheldrake I'd like to come up and

see him? It's rather important.

Will you call me back, please?

BUD

Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news

for you. All your troubles are over.

I'm going to take Miss Kubelik off

your hands.

(nods to himself with satisfaction)

The plain fact is, Mr. Sheldrake,

that I love her. I haven't told her

yet, but I thought you should be

the first to know. After all, you

don't really want her, and I do,

and although it may sound

presumptuous, she needs somebody

like me. So I think it would be the

thing all around --

(the phone rings and

he picks it up)

-- solution-wise.

(into phone)

Yes? I'll be right up.

BUD

(to himself)

Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news

for you --

KIRKEBY

Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?

DOBISCH

Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a

Yellow Cab?

KIRKEBY

(as they move away

from the elevators)

That guy really must've belted him.

DOBISCH

Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to

himself.

ELEVATOR OPERATOR

Twenty-seven.

BUD

You see, Mr. Sheldrake, those two

days she spent in the apartment --

it made me realize how lonely I'd

been before. But thanks to you, I'm

in a financial position to marry

her -- if I can ever square things

with her family.

SECRETARY'S VOICE

Mr. Baxter is here.

SHELDRAKE

Send him in.

BUD

Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news

for you --

SHELDRAKE

And I've got good news for you,

Baxter. All your troubles are over.

BUD

(reacting to the echo)

Sir?

SHELDRAKE

I know how worried you were about

Miss Kubelik -- well, stop

worrying -- I'm going to take her

off your hands.

BUD

(stunned)

You're going to take her off my

hands?

SHELDRAKE

That's right.

(indicating suitcases)

I've moved out of my house -- I'm

going to be staying in town, at the

Athletic Club.

BUD

You left your wife?

SHELDRAKE

Well, if you must know -- I fired

my secretary, my secretary got to

my wife, and my wife fired me.

Ain't that a kick in the head?

BUD

Yeah --

SHELDRAKE

Now what was your news, Baxter?

BUD

(recovering with difficulty)

It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's

all right again -- so she went back

home.

SHELDRAKE

Swell. And don't think I've

forgotten what you did for me.

(opens door to

adjoining office)

This way, Baxter.

SHELDRAKE

Sit down. Try it on for size.

SHELDRAKE

You like?

(indicating office)

It's all yours.

BUD

Mine?

SHELDRAKE

My assistant, Roy Thompson, has

been shifted to the Denver office,

and you're taking his place.

(no reaction from Bud)

What's the matter, Baxter? You

don't seem very excited.

BUD

Well, it's just that so many things

have been happening so fast -- I'm

very pleased -- especially for Miss

Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to

know her better, I think she's the

kind of girl that definitely ought

to be married to somebody --

SHELDRAKE

Oh, sure, sure. But first the

property settlement has to be

worked out -- then it takes six

weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm

going to enjoy being a bachelor for

a while.

(starts back toward

his own office)

Oh, by the way, you can now have

lunch in the executive dining

room --

BUD

Yes, sir.

SHELDRAKE

That's just one of the privileges

that goes with this job. You also

get a nice little expense account,

the use of the executive washroom --

(breaks off, peers at

Bud's face)

Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

BUD

I got kicked in the head, too.

SHELDRAKE

Oh?

DISSOLVE TO:

FRAN

Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

BUD

Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?

FRAN

Fine. How's your eye?

BUD

Fine.

FRAN

How's everything at the apartment?

BUD

Nothing's changed. You know, we

never finished that gin game --

FRAN

I know.

(a beat)

I suppose you heard about Mr.

Sheldrake --?

BUD

You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah.

I'm very happy for you.

FRAN

I never thought he'd do it.

BUD

I told you all along. You see, you

were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.

FRAN

I guess so.

BUD

For that matter, you were wrong

about me, too. What you said about

those who take and those who get

took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't

using me -- I was using him. See?

(indicating his name

on directory)

Last month I was at desk 861 on the

nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the

twenty-seventh floor, paneled

office, three windows -- so it all

worked out fine -- we're both

getting what we want.

FRAN

Yes.

(looks at her watch)

You walking to the subway?

BUD

No, thank you.

(fumbling)

I -- well, to tell you the truth --

(glancing around lobby)

-- I have this heavy date for

tonight --

FRAN

Oh.

BUD

Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?

FRAN

No. You know how people talk. So I

decided it would be better if we

didn't see each other till

everything is settled, divorce-wise.

BUD

That's very wise.

FRAN

Good night, Mr. Baxter.

BUD

Good night, Miss Kubelik.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHELDRAKE

Baxter -- would you mind stepping

in her for a minute?

BAXTER'S VOICE

Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

BOOTBLACK

Much obliged.

BUD

(putting charts on desk)

Here's the breakdown of figures on

personnel turnover. Thirty-seven

percent of our female employees

leave to get married, twenty-two

percent quit because --

SHELDRAKE

(breaking in)

You're working too hard, Baxter.

It's New Year's Eve -- relax.

BUD

Yes, sir.

SHELDRAKE

I suppose you'll be on the town

tonight -- celebrating?

BUD

Naturally.

SHELDRAKE

Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik

out -- I finally talked her into

it --

BUD

I see.

SHELDRAKE

The only thing is I'm staying at

the Athletic Club -- and it's

strictly stag so if you don't

mind --

BUD

Don't mind what?

SHELDRAKE

You know that other key to your

apartment -- well, when we had that

little scare about Miss Kubelik, I

thought I'd better get rid of it

quick -- so I threw it out the

window of the commuter train.

BUD

Very clever.

SHELDRAKE

Now I'll have to borrow your key.

BUD

Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.

SHELDRAKE

What do you mean, sorry?

BUD

You're not going to bring anybody

up to my apartment.

SHELDRAKE

I'm not just bringing anybody --

I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.

BUD

Especially not Miss Kubelik.

SHELDRAKE

How's that again?

BUD

(flatly)

No key!

SHELDRAKE

Baxter, I picked you for my team

because I thought you were a bright

young man. You realize what you're

doing? Not to me -- but to yourself.

Normally it takes years to work

your way up to the twenty-seventh

floor -- but it takes only thirty

seconds to be out on the street

again. You dig?

BUD

(nodding slowly)

I dig.

SHELDRAKE

So what's it going to be?

SHELDRAKE

Now you're being bright?

BUD

Thank you, sir.

SHELDRAKE

Say, Baxter -- you gave me the

wrong key.

BUD

No I didn't.

SHELDRAKE

(holding it out)

But this is the key to the executive

washroom.

BUD

That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I

won't be needing it -- because I'm

all washed up around here.

SHELDRAKE

What's gotten into you, Baxter?

BUD

Just following doctor's orders.

I've decided to become a mensch.

You know what that means? A human

being.

SHELDRAKE

Now hold on, Baxter --

BUD

Save it. The old payola won't work

any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

DISSOLVE TO:

DR. DREYFUSS

Say, Baxter -- we're having a

little party and we ran out of

ice -- so I was wondering --

BUD

Sure, Doc.

DR. DREYFUSS

(stepping inside)

How come you're alone on New Year's

Eve?

BUD

Well, I have things to do --

DR. DREYFUSS

(noticing cartons)

What's this -- you packing?

BUD

Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.

DR. DREYFUSS

Where are you moving to?

BUD

I don't know. All I know is I got

to get out of this place.

DR. DREYFUSS

Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

BUD

Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't

worry, Doc -- it'll go to the

University -- I'll put it in

writing --

BUD

Can you use a bottle of champagne?

DR. DREYFUSS

Booze we don't need. Why don't you

join us, Baxter? We got two brain

surgeons, an ear, nose and throat

specialist, a proctologist, and

three nurses from Bellevue.

BUD

No, thanks -- I don't feel like it.

Look, Doc -- in case I don't see

you again -- how much do I owe you

for taking care of that girl?

DR. DREYFUSS

Forget it -- I didn't do it as a

doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.

(stopping in doorway)

By the way, whatever happened to her?

BUD

(airily)

You know me with girls. Easy come,

easy go. Goodbye, Doc.

DR. DREYFUSS

Happy New Year.

CUT TO:

SHELDRAKE

Sorry it took me so long on the

phone. But we're all set.

FRAN

All set for what?

SHELDRAKE

I rented a car -- it's going to be

here at one o'clock -- we're

driving to Atlantic City.

FRAN

Atlantic City?

SHELDRAKE

I know it's a drag -- but you can't

find a hotel room in town -- not on

New Year's Eve.

FRAN

(a long look at Sheldrake)

Ring out the old year, ring in the

new. Ring-a-ding-ding.

SHELDRAKE

I didn't plan it this way, Fran --

actually, it's all Baxter's fault.

FRAN

Baxter?

SHELDRAKE

He wouldn't give me the key to the

apartment.

FRAN

He wouldn't.

SHELDRAKE

Just walked out on me -- quit --

threw that big fat job right in my

face.

FRAN

(a faint smile)

The nerve.

SHELDRAKE

That little punk -- after all I did

for him! He said I couldn't bring

anybody to his apartment --

especially not Miss Kubelik. What's

he got against you, anyway?

FRAN

(a faraway look in

her eye)

I don't know. I guess that's the

way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.

SHELDRAKE

What are you talking about?

FRAN

I'd spell it out for you -- only I

can't spell.

SHELDRAKE

Happy New Year, Fran.

SHELDRAKE

Fran --

(looking around)

-- where are you, Fran?

DISSOLVE TO:

FRAN

Mr. Baxter!

(pounding on door)

Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

FRAN

(sagging with relief)

Are you all right?

BUD

I'm fine.

FRAN

Are you sure? How's your knee?

BUD

I'm fine all over.

FRAN

Mind if I come in?

BUD

(still stunned)

Of course not.

BUD

Let me get another glass.

FRAN

(looking around)

Where are you going?

BUD

Who knows? Another neighborhood --

another town -- another job -- I'm

on my own.

FRAN

That's funny -- so am I.

(Bud, pouring

champagne, looks up

at her)

What did you do with the cards?

BUD

(indicating carton)

In there.

BUD

What about Mr. Sheldrake?

FRAN

I'm going to send him a fruit cake

every Christmas.

FRAN

Cut.

BUD

I love you, Miss Kubelik.

FRAN

(cutting a card)

Seven --

(looking at Bud's card)

-- queen.

BUD

Did you hear what I said, Miss

Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.

FRAN

(smiling)

Shut up and deal!

FADE OUT.
