Is that everything? It seemed like

he was saying a lot more.

Like an old friend, and into the

camera.

It is a big honor to be invited to

his show.

MISS KAWASAKI

Can you stay until Friday?

BOB

I'll have to see about that.

CUT TO:

BOB

Can you get me on a flight Thursday

night?

ELAINE (O.S.)

We're looking into it Bob, but they

really want you to stay to do that

talk show Friday, apparently it's a

really big deal, he's the Johnny

Carson of Japan.

BOB

Yeah, they told me.

ELAINE (O.S.)

These people are paying you a lot,

do you think you could consider it?

BOB

Just get me out of here as soon as

you can.

ELAINE (O.S.)

Ok, you're scheduled to leave

Saturday, but we'll hold a seat

Thursday in case, but first class is

full, you're waitlisted for an

upgrade... there might be a seat on

Lufthansa...

Oh, great. I'll talk to you later,

bye.

BOB

BOB & BARTENDER

'Suntory time'!

CHARLOTTE

What are you doing here?

BOB

My wife needs space, I don't know my

kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants

Tiger Woods, but they could get me,

so I'm here doing a whiskey

commercial.

CHARLOTTE

Oh.

CHARLOTTE

I'll just have a beer.

BOB

What about you? Why are you here?

CHARLOTTE

My husband's here for work-he's a

photographer- and I just came

along...I'm not really doing anything

right now, and we have some friends

who live here.

BOB

How long have you been married?

CHARLOTTE

Two years.

BOB

Try twenty-five.

CHARLOTTE

You're probably just having a mid-

life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?

BOB

I'm thinking about it.

CHARLOTTE

25 years... that's a long time...

Are you still in love with your wife?

BOB

Yes... I don't know, I don't know

her anymore. I don't know if you can

be in love with one person the whole

time. I was... actually I was in

love with her sister first, when I

was twenty-one. And one day her sister

said to me she wanted to move to

Paris, so I said okay, and she said

no, she wanted to move to Paris with

Francois,   and she's still married

to him. And I moved in with Lydia...

but I always really liked Lydia.

CHARLOTTE

(amused with too much

info)

Oh.

BOB

What do you do?

CHARLOTTE

I'm not sure, yet... I graduated

last spring.

BOB

What did you study?

CHARLOTTE

Philosophy.

BOB

Oh, what do you do with that?

CHARLOTTE

I don't know, but I can think about

it, a lot.

BOB

It takes a while to figure it out.

I'm sure you will, though.

CHARLOTTE

Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis

will work out,too.

BOB

Thanks.

CHARLOTTE

I wish I could sleep BOB Me, too.

CUT TO:

KELLY

John! What are you doing here?

JOHN

I'm just here shooting this band,

what about you?

KELLY

Promoting that action movie I did...

KELLY

...doing like twenty million

interviews a day... It's soo good to

see you. How long are you here for?

JOHN

We're here for the week. I'm shooting

in Osaka for a few days.

KELLY

It's amazing  there!

JOHN

Have you met Charlotte? My wife.

KELLY

No!  Hi! So great to meet you!

CHARLOTTE

Hi, nice to meet you.

KELLY

You know, John, you're my favorite

photographer, I only want to be shot

by you.

JOHN

Uh..thanks.

KELLY

(as she fans out her

top)

Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've

been sweating in this little room

with T.V. lights for hours...

JOHN

Oh no...

KELLY

(with a big smile)

...Well, I have the worst  headache,

I have to go find some aspirin. But,

call me, let's have a drink, I'm

under Evelyn Waugh.

JOHN

Ok, see you later.

CHARLOTTE

Evelyn Waugh?

JOHN

What?

CHARLOTTE

Evelyn Waugh was a man.

JOHN

Oh, c'mon, she's nice.  Not everyone

went to Yale.

JOHN

Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't

matter.

CHARLOTTE

Why do you have to defend her?

JOHN

I'm not, but do you have to point

out how stupid everyone is.

CHARLOTTE

No, I thought it was funny. Forget

it.

PRODUCER

(looks at his watch)

We should get going.

JOHN

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Hi Charlotte, I don't know if you're

in town... but I'm having a birthday

party for my dog, Louise, tomorrow

night, at my house around eight...

MOTHER (O.S.)

fabulous time in Japan!  How exciting,

and hope you and your adorable husband

are enjoying it...I was sitting next

to Cathryn Myles last night at this

dinner and she was telling me about

her daughter who had this awful

boyfriend and a messy break-up and

how hard it is,and now she's single

and wants to start a family, I'm so

glad that you're settled, and not in

that situation.  Anyway, call me

when you have a chance, I'm trying

to put Thanksgiving plans together,

whether we want to go skiing or.

Daddy wants to stay home and have it

here, which might be easier with

Lauren and the children, but let me

know what your feelings are, I do

hope you and John can make it. Call

me, I love you.

SWEATY JOURNALIST

What was it like working with Keanu

Reeves?

KELLY

It was great. I've known him for a

while now- you know we both live in

L.A. We both have dogs...

DR. KENEGARD

(dry & monotonous)

Plato's text calls this image the

"paradeigma".  So the lot is the

image that is your inheritance, your

place on earth, all compacted into a

pattern that has been selected by

your soul before you even got here-

or better said, that is always and

continually being selected by your

soul,because time does not enter the

equation of myth.-

CUT TO:

CHARLOTTE

How'd it go today?

JOHN

Good...I'm tired.

JOHN

I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink

downstairs. She wants to talk about

some photo thing.

CHARLOTTE

Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.

JOHN

You wanna come?

CHARLOTTE

Sure.

JOHN

(doesn't really want

her to)

Ok.

CUT TO:

KELLY

...My Dad was anorexic.

CHARLOTTE

(she's never heard of that)

Really?

KELLY

(very serious)

He was on the American side at the

Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was

taken prisoner, and they tortured

them about their food the whole time.

BENZO

Where?

KELLY

My dad fought on the American side

at the Bay of Pigs. So, when he was

a prisoner, they would tell them

they had put poison in their food

and they would make themselves throw

up... and when he got back, he did

better, but he still has food issues.

He has to have really clean food.

And really simple. He can't just go

have, say, Chinese food.

JOHN

(trying)

Oh, that's too bad.

BENZO

(nodding at the view)

How crazy is this shit?

CHARLOTTE

Yeah, it is.

KELLY

...Oh my god you have to try it,

this power cleanse is amazing- it's

lemon juice and grade B maple syrup

and cayenne pepper for seven days.

Just like a half a teaspoon of

cayenne. The first few days you're a

little scattered, but by day four -

it's amazing... my eyes were so

white...

CHARLOTTE

Hi again, how's it going?

BOB

Who do I have to fuck to get off

this planet?

JOHN

No, what are you talking about.

CHARLOTTE

I went to a temple today and I didn't

feel anything.

JOHN

That's ok.

CHARLOTTE

I don't know what to do.

JOHN

That's ok, you'll figure it out.

CHARLOTTE

You smell weird.

JOHN

What?

CHARLOTTE

Like popcorn?

JOHN

I got some hair stuff.

CHARLOTTE

Hair stuff?

JOHN

I gotta go to work.

JOHN

I'll be right down...I'm just

leaving...ok.

JOHN

See you later.

CHARLOTTE

Bye.

CUT TO:

CHARLOTTE

Lauren?

LAUREN (O.S.)

Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?

CHARLOTTE

It's cool... but,I don't know... I

went to a shrine today and all these

little monk's were chanting... and,

I didn't feel anything... I even

tried ikebana, ...   and John's using

hair products... I don't know who

I.

LAUREN

Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?

CHARLOTTE

Sure.

LAUREN

Sorry about that, what were you

saying?

CHARLOTTE

Oh, it's nothing... I better go,

I'll talk to you later.

LAUREN

Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky

you don't have any kids yet and you

can go off to Japan... call me when

you get back.

Ouch.

JOHN (O.C.)

At the fitting, they had all these

rock n roll clothes, the label guys

kept saying lock n loll, though, but

the band doesn't look tough at

all...they look better just skinny

and nerdy, like how when they came

in...they looked so uncomfortable in

these Keith Richards clothes, they

should just be like they are, don't

you think?

CHARLOTTE

Yeah.

JOHN

Yeah, I think you're probably right...

because when you try to...

CHARLOTTE

Do you think it's done?

JOHN

I don't know.

JOHN

Will you please stop smoking?

CHARLOTTE

But I like to... and I don't smoke

that much.

JOHN

Its bad for you.

CHARLOTTE

Ok, I will... later.

JOHN

A Soul's Search: Finding Your True

Character and calling? Is this yours?

CHARLOTTE

Oh... that's nothing, someone gave

it to me.

JOHN

You don't have to be embarrassed.

CHARLOTTE

I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm

not into it.

JOHN

It's ok if you are.

JOHN

Oh, the record company sent these...

CHARLOTTE

Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.

JOHN

I gotta go... and I don't really

like champagne.

JOHN

Are you sure you want to stay?

CHARLOTTE

Are you sure you have to go?

CHARLOTTE

Yeah, I know you have to work the

whole time, I'll probably have more

fun here. I'll call Charlie and those

guys.

JOHN

Ok, definitely call them, I'll be

back Friday. I love you.

CHARLOTTE

I love you.

CHARLOTTE

I miss you.

JOHN

CHARLOTTE

Not really. How long are you here

BOB

Ok.

CHARLOTTE

See you later.

You really are having a mid-life

CHARLOTTE

No.

BOB

I read it, too.

CUT TO:

CHARLOTTE

Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie

Brown.

BOB

Hi, Charlie.

CHARLOTTE

His real name's Hayashi, but someone

started calling him Charlie because

they thought he looked like Charlie

Brown. They've all got American

nicknames because its easier for me

to remember... they were just out in

L.A. last month doing a shoot with

John... that guy's Mr.Valentine,

he's the art director of their

magazine, I don't even know his real

name, or why I call him that.

CHARLIE

This is Bambi.

CHARLOTTE

Hi.

BOB

Lydia?

LYDIA (O.S.)

Hello, darling.

BOB

Lydia, I went to this great house

tonight, this guy designed and built,

you would have loved it.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.

BOB

He was this fashion guy, and there

were all these Japanese fashion people-

it's a whole other world, and I was

talking to these Japanese surfers...

He was playing all this great music-

I have to find out what it was...

LYDIA (O.S.)

That sounds great  can you hold

on...

(talks to daughter)

What Zoe?

ZOE (O.S.)

I don't want it.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Well, you have to have something for

breakfast. Do you want cereal?

ZOE (O.S.)

No.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Just trying to get her to eat

something...I'm glad you're having

fun.

BOB

Yeah, its really different here.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Well, that's good, I have to get the

kids off for school.  Can I call you

in a little while?

BOB

It's four in the morning... I'm going

to go to sleep.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Ok, well... I love you.

BOB

I love you, too, good-night, or good-

CHARLOTTE (O.S.)

Thanks for getting me back in one

piece.

CUT TO:

BOB (O.S.)

Of course.

CHARLOTTE

Do you want to have some breakfast?

BOB (O.S.)

Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and

I'll meet you downstairs.

CHARLOTTE

OK, see you downstairs.

CUT TO:

CHARLOTTE

(trying to make it

light)

Hey look, it's Sausalito.

BOB

I see them every morning.

CUT TO:

FADE OUT:

CUT TO:

BOB

Hans was very attentive to you.

CHARLOTTE

I think he kind of liked me...Is

that so hard to imagine?

BOB

No, its easy.

CHARLOTTE

How'd a Japanese guy get a name like

Hans?

BOB

I don't know.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CHARLOTTE

Do you remember when we met at the

bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.

BOB

But the first time I saw you was in

the elevator.

CHARLOTTE

Really?

BOB

Yeah, you don't remember?

CHARLOTTE

Did I scowl at you?

BOB

No, you smiled.

CHARLOTTE

I don't remember.

BOB

I know, I kind of blend in here.

CUT TO:

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Why do they switch the r's and l's

here?

BOB (O.C.)

I don't know. My fax said "have a

good fright".

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Let's never come here again, because

it would never be as much fun.

BOB (O.C.)

Ok, whatever you want.

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Did you see Hiromix last night dancing

with Bambi?

BOB (O.C.)

No, I was looking at you.

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Oh.  Well... they were dancing on

the couch with that weird English

guy who kept talking about hanging

out with the Sex Pistols on Kings

Road...

BOB (O.C.)

I got a fax today from your friend

Hiromix.

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Oh, for her show?

BOB (O.C.)

No, for a candlelight dinner, yes,

for her show.

CHARLOTTE (O.C.)

Oh.

BOB (O.C.)

You're possessive.

CHARLOTTE (O.S.)

I know.

CUT TO:

CHARLOTTE (O.S.)

I'm stuck. Does it get easier.

BOB

No, yes, it does...

CHARLOTTE

Yeah? But look at you.

BOB

Thanks. It does, the more you know

who you are... you don't care about

things the same way...

CHARLOTTE

I just don't know what I'm supposed

to be. I thought maybe I wanted to

be a writer... but I hate what I

write, and I tried taking pictures,

but John's so good at that, and mine

are so mediocre... and every girl

goes through a photography phase,

like horses, you know dumb pictures

of your feet...

BOB

You'll figure it out. I'm not worried

about you. Keep writing.

CHARLOTTE

But, I'm mean.

BOB

That's ok.

CHARLOTTE

And marriage, does that get easier?

BOB

It's hard. We started going to a

marriage counselor.

CHARLOTTE

Did that help? Did you learn anything?

BOB

We established that we have no

communication.

CHARLOTTE

Oh.

BOB

We used to have fun, she used to

like to go to places with me for my

movies and we would laugh at all the

weirdos, but now she's tired of it

all. She never wants to leave the

kids, she doesn't need me, and they

don't need me, I feel like I'm in

the way. It gets complicated when

you have kids... that changes

everything.

CHARLOTTE

That's too scary.

BOB

When they're born its like Vietnam.

It's terrifying.

CHARLOTTE

(getting tired)

No one ever tells you that...

BOB

But, it's great being with them,

after they can talk, and can do things

with you.

CHARLOTTE

That's nice. My parents were always

traveling, they weren't around so

much.

BOB

Where'd you grow up?

CHARLOTTE

In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador

to France in the eighties, so we

went to school in Paris for a few

years... but we mostly lived in D.C.,

and they were never around... and

then I moved to Los Angeles when

John and I got married... it's so

different there.

BOB

I know.

CHARLOTTE

John thinks I'm so snotty.

BOB

You are.

CHARLOTTE

I know, but that's what you like

about me.

CHARLOTTE

Why do you have to be with your

opposite, why cant similar people be

together?

BOB

Because that would be too easy.

FADE OUT:

CUT TO:

BOB

Hello?

RECEPTION

CHARLOTTE

You made it.

BOB

They really have to work on that

street name thing.

CHARLOTTE

What's that?

BOB

It's for my daughter.

CHARLOTTE

How old is she?

BOB

Four.

CHARLOTTE

Oh, she'll love it.

BOB

Nice one.

CHARLOTTE

(mouth full)

Fuck off.

BOB

What happened to your toe?

CHARLOTTE

I don't know, I think maybe I broke

it? I knocked into something the

other day...

BOB

That doesn't look good.

CHARLOTTE

It's bad isn't it?

BOB

We should get you to the doctor.

CHARLOTTE

You think so?

BOB

Yeah, look at that thing.

CUT TO:

BOB

How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?

RECEPTION (O.S.)

Excuse me?

BOB

about staying for that talk show.

BOB

Ok.

ELAINE (O.S.)

Hi, Lydia.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Is this a bad time?

BOB

Uh, no.

LYDIA (O.S.)

(O.S.) It's really hard to reach

you... Did you get the carpet samples?

I like the burgundy.

BOB

Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.

LYDIA (O.S.)

It's just carpet.

BOB

That's not what I'm talking about.

LYDIA (O.S.)

What are you talking about?

BOB

I don't know.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Is there anything I can do?

BOB

I don't know... I want to be more

healthy. I want to eat better.

LYDIA (O.S.)

What?

BOB

You know, eat healthier.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Alright?

BOB

Not all that pasta.

LYDIA (O.S.)

Fine.

BOB

Like Japanese food.

LYDIA (O.S.)

(sarcastic)

Why don't you just stay there, and

you can have it everyday.

BOB

Oh, come on.

LYDIA (O.S.)

I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe,

I'll talk to you later. Are you going

to be Ok?

Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.

BOB

Do you ever see him?

CHARLOTTE

(sorta)

Yeah.

BOB

Do you know where we are?

CHARLOTTE

No.

CHARLOTTE

Isn't it weird there are no street

names in Tokyo... you'd think a city

like this would have street names...

you need a map to get anywhere...

look, there are no signs...

FADE OUT:

CHARLOTTE

Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone?

I'm not sure...I'm going to go to

CHARLOTTE

You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan

after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?

BOB

No, we'll find something around here.

CUT TO:

CHARLOTTE

The Jazz singer? The red-head?

CHARLOTTE

Well, I guess she's more around your

age...  You guys could talk about

things in common, like growing up in

the fifties.

BOB

You're a brat, wasn't there anyone

else around to lavish you with

attention?

CHARLOTTE

I can't tell the difference?

BOB

We'll have two of these.

BOB

What do you want to drink?

CHARLOTTE

A coke.

BOB

So, where'd you go today.

They're not going to play the whole

album, are they?

I'm going to miss you.

That's what you said the other night.

CHARLOTTE

Well, I mean it more now.

CUT TO:

NEW SINGER

Good Evening. I'm Carl West, and

we're thrilled to be joining you

this week, here at the NY bar in

Shinjuku.

SINGER

Jt seems we stood and talked like

this before,   we looked at  each

other in  the same way thenr   but

I cant remember where or when...

BOB

I don't want to go back tomorrow.

CHARLOTTE

I know. But, it doesn't last, you

have to go back sometime.

BOB

Why can't it last?

CHARLOTTE

I don't know, it just doesn't, reality

changes things....we can't stay here

forever, unless maybe we started a

Jazz band.

SINGER (O.C.)

Somethings  that happen for the first

time,   seem to be happening again

and so it  seems we have met before,

and laughed before,   and loved

before,   but who knows where or

when...
