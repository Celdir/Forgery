MY GIRL

Written by

VADA

(to camera)

I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet

seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids.

And i've learned to live with this chicken

Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the

past three years, so I knew Dad would be

devastated when he learned of my latest

affliction.

(to Harry)

Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left

breast is developing at a significantly faster

rate than my right. It can only mean one

thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.

HARRY

(ignoring Vada)

O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of

the fridge.

VADA

All right, who's in raise your hand.

BOY

Are you coming or not Thomas J?

THOMAS J

I don't think so.

VADA

I knew he wouldn't come.

THOMAS J

I can't, I have to go home.

BOY#2

Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.

VADA

Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.

VADA

(to boy#2)

Hey, you didn't pay me!

BOY#2

How do I know you were gonna show us one?

VADA

You're such a baby.

BOY#2

All right, here.

VADA

All right, follow me and don't say a word.

You ready?

You sure you wanna see it, or is someone

gonna go yellow belly?

BOY#3

I'm not chicken!

VADA

Okay. Lean forward.

GIRL#1

It's empty!

BOY#2

You're so weird!

BOY

I want my money back!

VADA

I was afraid of this.

BOY#2

Of what??

VADA

Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not

completely dead, you know, like when they cut

a chickens head off and it still runs around

crazy.

BOY#3

You're full of shit.

VADA

I bet she's roaming around this house

somewhere.

There she is, in the rocking chair.

VADA

Hi Grammoo.

HARRY

(in distance, from

downstairs)

Vada would you bring down my cigarettes?

VADA

Seeya later.

(kisses Grammoo on forehead)

HARRY

Did I tell you, he was my woodshop teacher.

ARTHUR

You took woodshop?

HARRY

Yeah, I made a tie rack.

ARTHUR

I made a tie rack.

VADA

Ahem.

HARRY

Vada, just put 'em on the stool.

VADA

Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly

yesterday.

HARRY

(completely ignoring Vada's

comment)

Ya, that rack holds six ties.

ARTHUR

I still have mine.

VADA

Arthur!!

ARTHUR

Vada!!

VADA

I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.

ARTHUR

Good for you baby.

VADA

Once you put the hotels on board walk and

Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.

ARTHUR

I like to buy off all the railroads.

HARRY

Vada, we're trying to work here.

VADA

Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she

was gonna make a fur out of 'em!

HARRY

(to Arthur)

Hand me the canula.

HARRY

(annoyed)

VADA!

VADA

Dad?

HARRY

I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't

sing.

(beat)

All right Arthur, just a slide of the

needle.....

(fades out as Vada climbs

stairs)

HARRY

(to corpse)

One nice model C-501 bronze stainless eternal

journey, yeah, you look like a champion.

STRANGER

Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in?

VADA

Sure, come on in.

So, have you had the unfortunate experience

of recently losing a loved one?

STRANGER

(puzzled look)

Could I see your Dad, just for a second?

VADA

DAD, SOMEBODY'S HERE!!

He's downstairs working on Mr. Layton.

Prostate Cancer. Once it hits your prostate,

you're a goner.

STRANGER

Oh.

HARRY

How may I... Help you?

STRANGER

I'm Shelly devoto. We spoke, the other day

regarding the make up artist job.

HARRY

Oh yes.

SHELLY

It's still available I hope?

HARRY

I think it's still available.

SHELLY

I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for

two years, at the "Dino Raphael" Salon, all my

customers cried when I told them I was

leaving.

HARRY

Uhh, Miss devoto...

SHELLY

I have a wonderful disposition, I put people

right at ease.

HARRY

Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at

ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a

Funeral Parlor.

SHELLY

They're dead?

HARRY

Yes they are.

SHELLY

Stiffs??

HARRY

(for want of a better word)

Deceased.

SHELLY

The add just said "Makeup Artist"

HARRY

Ahh, excuse me a second will you?

(opens door)

Hi George, this is a twelve-fifty-eight, I

didn't want the burnished handles.

(door closes off scene)

VADA

Is that your camper?

SHELLY

Yes it is.

VADA

That's really cool.

SHELLY

(to Grammoo)

Hello.

VADA

She's shy.

SHELLY

Oh.

HARRY

Just put it back in the display room fellers.

MEN

Okay Harry.

VADA

Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?

HARRY

They come in all sizes honey, just like

shoes.

VADA

Is it for a child?

HARRY

Of course not.

VADA

Then who's it for?

HARRY

Short people, very short people.

SHELLY

Excuse me, what about the job?

HARRY

Pardon?

SHELLY

I need the job.

HARRY

Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...

SHELLY

Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my

former clients will eventually die, and all

your clients used to be alive, so they have

something in common.

HARRY

You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering

the phone.

SHELLY

Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.

HARRY

Great, you can start right away. Call me

Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally

wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it,

very much, but the....

SHELLY

I promise i'll take good care of these

people, they deserve it, they're dead, all

they've got left is their looks.

THOMAS J

Hey look at this, no feet!

VADA

Oh wow, a real evil canieval.

PSYCHO MECHANIC

WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY GARAGE, GET

OUTTA HERE!!!

NURSE RANDALL

Hi Vada, what's wrong today?

VADA

I'm very sick.

NURSE RANDALL

Okay, take a seat, i'll check if the doctor

can see you.

NURSE RANDALL

Okay, he'll see you, why don't you go in?

VADA

Well, what is it? I can handle it.

DR WELTY

You are perfectly healthy.

VADA

That can't be, I have all the classic

symptoms.

DR WELTY

Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your

house today?

VADA

Yes.

DR WELTY

Vada you've gotta stop this, there's

absolutely nothing wrong with you!

VADA

I'll just have to get a second opinion.

THOMAS J

So, what'd he say was wrong with you?

VADA

The whole medical profession is a crack.

THOMAS J

Hey wait up for me!

VADA

Hey look!

THOMAS J

At what?

VADA

That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.

THOMAS J

I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!

VADA

Hi Mr. Bixler!

MR. BIXLER

Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr.

J! How's the summer treating you?

VADA

It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the

books for summer reading.

MR. BIXLER

Really? Already? The summer's just begun.

VADA

Yes, and now I'm reading War & Peace for fun.

MR. BIXLER

No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about

you Thomas J?

THOMAS J

I haven't started yet.

MR. BIXLER

Better get on his case Vada.

VADA

Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old

house?

MR. BIXLER

Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.

VADA

This is one big house for one single person.

MR. BIXLER

Well, you never can tell...

(Vada gets worried look on

her face)

I might get a pet.

(Vada's expression relaxes,

she smiles)

VADA

How are you gonna get the money for this old

house if you're not working?

MR. BIXLER

Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this

summer, so, I'm doing some work.

VADA

How much does it cost?

MR. BIXLER

Thirty five dollars.

VADA

What do you get for that?

MR. BIXLER

Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry.

This an interrogation Vada?

VADA

No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off

War & Peace.

MR. BIXLER

It's summer! You're kids! Go play!

THOMAS J

Wanna go to Gray's orchard and pick some

peaches?

VADA

No, I'm going home.

THOMAS J

Why? It's not dinner time yet.

VADA

Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go

home to eat.

Don't pee on the hydrant!!

(song is "Wedding Bell

Blues")

SHELLY

Excuse me Harry, I finished Mr. Layton's

hair. He kinda looked......

(she sees Vada lying down

sprawled out on the floor)

Harry, what's wrong with her??

HARRY

Oh, she's just pretending. Vada, get up here

and eat your broccoli!

VADA

(very sick sounding voice)

I think it's my prostate.

GRAMMOO

I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man who

could ask for anything more? I got daisies, in

green pastures, I got my man, who could ask

for anything more?

SHELLY

Who's winning?

VADA

I am.

GIRL#1

Look, there's Vada and her little BOYFRIEND

(very mocking voice)

VADA

He is not my boyfriend!

GIRL#2

I bet she kissed him on the lips!

VADA

Do you think I kissed that ugly old thing?

THOMAS J

Yeah anyway.

GIRL#2

Come on let's go.

GIRL#1 & GIRL#2

Judy's father owns the movie theater and we

get to see all the movies WE want for free.

JUDY

Maybe you can come some time.

GUY#2

Eeeuww, don't invite HER, she'll have to

bring her boyfriend.

GIRL#2

(together)

Vada and Thomas, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-

I-N-G, first comes love, then comes marriage,

then comes Thomas J in a baby carriage.

SHELLY

You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls

upset you.

VADA

I'm not upset. I will never play with those

girls. I only surround myself with people who

I find intellectually stimulating.

SHELLY

(to Vada)

Want a piece of chocolate?

SHELLY

Thomas J?

THOMAS J

I'm allergic to it.

SHELLY

To chocolate?

VADA

He's allergic to everything.

SHELLY

Chocolate?

VADA & THOMAS J

TO EVERYTHING.

SHELLY

Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.

VADA

It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.

THOMAS J

It doesn't work, it always stays black.

(NOTE ring is BLACK)

VADA

It's only black when you're around 'cause you

put me in a bad mood.

SHELLY

Maybe black means you're happy?

VADA

I don't think so.

(pause)

Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?

THOMAS J

She's crazy, she wants to go to school over

the summer.

VADA

It's not a real school, it's a writing class,

I wanna be a writer.

THOMAS J

She only wants to do it because her sweetie

pie's the teacher.

VADA

Shut your big fat mouth!

SHELLY

I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask

your Dad?

VADA

He won't give it to me.

SHELLY

Well you don't know that. Ask him.

VADA

Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?

HARRY

That's a lot of money for a little girl.

VADA

It's for school, for summer writing class.

HARRY

(engrossed with TV show)

Any more soda left?

VADA

Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.

HARRY

Last month you wanted to play the violin.

Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.

VADA

Dad?

HARRY

(referring to TV)

I love this guy!

(he laughs)

VADA

Dad??

HARRY

What?

VADA

The money?

HARRY

Ahh, maybe next summer.

VADA'S THOUGHTS

He forgot about the time I wanted to be a

magician, I was really great at making myself

disappear.

VADA

Wanna play?

ARTHUR

No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your

head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.

See. You were looking at the ball. All right?

Keep your head up. Gimme some skin,

SHELLY

Vada? VADA?? What happened??

VADA

(extremely frightened and

timid)

My ball, I lost my ball.

SHELLY

(picking Vada up onto her

feet)

Come on sweetie.

SHELLY

Excuse me Harry?

HARRY

Uh huh?

SHELLY

Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?

HARRY

Yeah.

Didn't I give you a picture of what she

looked like?

SHELLY

Yeah,

(searches pockets, eventually

pulling out a photo)

SHELLY

You don't like it?

HARRY

This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have

her looking like a two dollar hooker.

SHELLY

(a little offended)

I think she looks nice! Her lips are very

thin so I used the gloss to give them a more

sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a

little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry,

nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.

HARRY

She did. This photo was taken a month ago at

the church food drive.

SHELLY

I just wanted to get past this "old school

Marm" image.

HARRY

That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school

Marm.

(beat)

Fix it.

SHELLY

Harry?

(Harry stops and turns

around)

I was just wondering, if there is anything

wrong with Vada.

HARRY

What do you mean??

SHELLY

Well the other night at dinner...

HARRY

Oh that, she just likes to play.

SHELLY

I don't think so, I think she's confused

about death.

HARRY

She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a

thing or two about it.

SHELLY

Harry, I really think she.....

HARRY

(annoyed)

She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl,

look, don't give me any advice about my

daughter, okay?

VADA

There's Shelly!

SHELLY

Hi.

VADA

Can we look around in your camper?

SHELLY

Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.

(surprised at Vada and Thomas

J's eagerness to get inside)

Woah! Gosh!

THOMAS J

Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you

really eat and sleep here?

SHELLY

Uh huh.

THOMAS J

I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.

SHELLY

Liverpool?

VADA

Big Ringo fan.

SHELLY

Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?

VADA

I would.

SHELLY

Thomas?

THOMAS J

Yes please.

THOMAS J

What are you reading?

SHELLY

Oh! You shouldn't be looking at that, it's a

little too old for you.

VADA

Did you read ALL these books?

SHELLY

Uh huh.

VADA

What are they about?

SHELLY

Mostly love, and romance.

THOMAS J

Eeeeuuuww, gross.

SHELLY

They're just fun to read.

Here, cheers.

VADA

Are you married?

SHELLY

No, I'm divorced.

VADA

Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.

SHELLY

Well, sometimes married people just find out

they can't live with each other.

THOMAS J

Mine aren't divorced.

Shelly, can I have a cookie?

SHELLY

Hmmmph gurgle gurgle...

THOMAS J

Hey, where are all the cookies??

SHELLY

Well, I guess you found my secret hiding

place.

THOMAS J

What are you saving for?

SHELLY

Nothing in particular, just putting it away

for a rainy day.

THOMAS J

I'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch,

thanks Shelly.

SHELLY

Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head

back?

VADA

Can I use your bathroom first?

SHELLY

Sure.

VADA

You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if

you're late.

SHELLY

Okay.

MR. BIXLER

The great way, is not difficult for those

with no preferences, with the absence of both

love and hate, everything becomes clear and

undisguised. That was written by a Chinese

Philosopher in the year 600. Now why would I

choose to bring that up in a creative writing

class? Because, the absence of judgment helps

us to appreciate reality. In other words, I

want you to listen to your classmates writing,

with a clear and open heart, okay? So who's

gonna go first?

GUY

I got one.

I sang a song for you to hear, I painted a

picture for you to see, I picked a rose for

you to smell, I planted grass for you to

touch, But you did not hear my song, You did

not see my picture, You did not smell my rose

and YOU did not touch my grass.

Woman

Maybe she was outta town?

GUY#2

That's not funny, his poem is about futility,

we toil in unrewarded obscurity.

MR. BIXLER

Now, I hear judgment, let's not forget the

part about the open heart...

Vada, is there, something I can do for you?

VADA

(very nervous)

I paid the money.

MR. BIXLER

For this class?

VADA

Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.

MR. BIXLER

Vada, this is an adult writing class.

JUSTIN

Hey, I think it's real beautiful. She want's

to be a writer.

MR. BIXLER

Vada, you sure you wanna do this?

MR. BIXLER

Welcome to the class, go find a seat.

Okay ahh, who's next?

RONDA

I experienced something with my boyfriend the

other day, and I wrote a few words down.

MR. BIXLER

The floor's yours Ronda.

RONDA

He covers me like a blanket, from the cold,

dark night, As I look into his eyes, I know

it's right, To touch, To feel, I know he's

real, Flesh all a mush, Flesh ALL a mush, I

can't fight it, There's no point, I wake up in

Lighter joint.

MR. BIXLER

Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.

VADA

I wrote a poem too.

MR. BIXLER

Please.

VADA

Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss

I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good

when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish,

This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate

or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.

That's all I got so far.

JUSTIN

I hear that Vada, Flesh all a Mush or Rocky

Road, it's about desire.

MR. BIXLER

Vada that's... It's very sweet, and it rhymes

and that's also good  but, you're not

expressing to me what's in your soul. I want

you to show me how you see the world, your

fears, your desires, your innermost secrets.

VADA'S THOUGHTS

My fears and secrets. I'm afraid I killed my

mother.

HARRY

(sung, to Grammoo)

Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.

SHELLY

Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let

you know that the flowers were delivered. And

the room's all set up.

HARRY

Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the

other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a

little harsh.

SHELLY

I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's

business. It's just that I like Vada, very

much.

HARRY

After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to

help take care of Vada. They were very close,

but lately as her mind's been wandering more

and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm

sure she'll snap out of it though.

SHELLY

I'm sure she will.

THOMAS J

Nothing's biting today.

VADA

Maybe they had a big breakfast.

THOMAS J

(hanging from tree)

I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.

VADA

Big deal, I can do that too.

(Thomas J's reel begins to

click)

Thomas J, you got something!

THOMAS J

Oh no!

(he jumps down from the tree)

UUH.

VADA

Hurry!

THOMAS J

I'm trying.

VADA

Reel it in.

(Thomas J reels the fish in)

He's only tiny, throw him back.

THOMAS J

I don't like touching fish, how do you pull

the hook out without touching it?

VADA

You're hurting him, don't kill him!!

VADA

Ouch! Darn hook!

VADA

I'm bleeding, did he get away? Go look.

THOMAS J

Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.

VADA

Hey, we can become blood brothers.

THOMAS J

Naah, I don't wanna.

VADA

You could pick that scab on your arm.

THOMAS J

It's a mosquito bite.

VADA

It'll bleed.

THOMAS J

If I do it, can we go?

VADA

Uh huh.

THOMAS J

Okay, OW!

VADA

Okay, rub them together.

VADA

Now we're blood brothers for life.

SHELLY

Hi.

HARRY

Oh Hi, what can I do for you?

SHELLY

Nothing, I was just wondering what you were

doing.

HARRY

Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you

know when someone dies people want it in the

paper usually, it's a service we provide for

the family.

SHELLY

Oh right, right,

(she picks up the newspaper).

Bader Lorenzo Died June 22

1972 Devoted husband to

Nicolette. Cherished father of

Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu

of flowers, please send

donations to the holy names

society.

HARRY

I wrote that.

SHELLY

No kidding?

SHELLY

Oh it's good, "In lieu of" I love that word

lieu.

HARRY

I prefer it to "instead", it has more

dignity.

SHELLY

In lieu... "instead".... No contest.

HARRY

It's no big deal.

SHELLY

You have to learn how to take a complement.

(Shelly turns the newspaper

over)

Movies, movies, ahhhh, "Love Story" at the

drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?

HARRY

I haven't been to the movies in AGES.

SHELLY

I love going to movies, especially at the

drive in. I don't think there's anything more

romantic than going to the drive in.

(subtle HINT)

I'll let you get back to work.

HARRY

I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to

join me for a game tomorrow night at church

you're welcome to.

SHELLY

(considers for a moment)

Okay.

SHELLY

Hi Vada.

VADA

Are you going out somewhere?

SHELLY

No.

VADA

So how come you're putting lipstick on?

SHELLY

A girl's always gotta look her best.

VADA

I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are

that color.

SHELLY

Have you ever tried any?

VADA

No.

SHELLY

Come here, sit down.

SHELLY

Now, first we blot.

SHELLY

Take a look. I think it looks real nice on

you.

VADA

Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?

SHELLY

Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've

got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest

little nose, an amazing mouth.

VADA

The boys at school don't think I am.

SHELLY

They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna

bring out the gorgeous color in them. The

first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can

never wear enough blue eye shadow.

VADA

Do you like putting makeup on people?

SHELLY

Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to

Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the

stars, I haven't gotten there yet.

(she finishes her work)

All right, open your eyes.

VADA

Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that

Hollywood thing.

THOMAS J

Your lip bleeding?

VADA

No.

THOMAS J

What's wrong with your eyes?

VADA

A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.

THOMAS J

Where's your bike?

VADA

Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.

VADA

It's only a garage, come on.

VADA

Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably

fell off in here.

THOMAS J

Hey look at this!

VADA

That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart,

they used to study the bumps in your head to

see if you had a good personality or not. Come

here, i'll diagnose your head.

THOMAS J

No, I don't wanna.

VADA

Come on, it's fun.

VADA

Hmmmm, interesting.

THOMAS J

What?

VADA

You have no personality.

THOMAS J

Hey, where does it say that?

VADA

Never mind.

THOMAS J

Is that your Dad?

VADA

Yes.

THOMAS J

Who's that with your Dad?

VADA

It's my mother.

THOMAS J

Do you remember her?

VADA

No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.

THOMAS J

What do you think it's like?

VADA

What?

THOMAS J

Heaven.

VADA

I think, everybody gets their own white

horse, and all they do is ride and eat

marshmallows all day, and everybody's best

friends with everybody else, when you play

sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets

picked last.

THOMAS J

But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?

VADA

It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular

horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal

if you fall, you just land in cloud.

THOMAS J

That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll

never find that streamer.

PHIL

Well well well, what's going on in here?

HARRY

Nothing, I'm dressing.

PHIL

Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry

Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to

lie to your big brother?

HARRY

HEY! WATCH THE HAIR!! THIS SHIRT GIVES!!! ALL

RIGHT!!!!

I'm going out with Shelly.

PHIL

Oh yes, oh that's great.

HARRY

I'm very nervous.

PHIL

Why?

HARRY

The last date I had was twenty years ago.

PHIL

That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me

fill you in on today's women, since the last

time you dated, something happened, "The

Sexual Revolution", now before that, you used

to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull

her chair out, pick up the check, no more no

more, you wanna know what else is missing?

BRAS!

HARRY

Oh come on.

PHIL

Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this

woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her

like every Tom Dick and Harry.

HARRY

Are you sure about all this?

PHIL

Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?

HARRY

Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any

minute.

PHIL

Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the

right track.

HARRY

No, she's just driving over here, then we're

taking my car. How do I look?

PHIL

Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.

HARRY

Goodnight Vada.

VADA

Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?

HARRY

Ahh, I just wanna look nice.

VADA

You never cared before.

HARRY

Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go

together.

VADA

Why?

HARRY

She likes to play bingo.

VADA

Can I go too?

HARRY

Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep

Grammoo company.

THOMAS J

Vada? Vada?? Where are you??

VADA

Here.

THOMAS J

Don't DO that!!

VADA

Sorry.

THOMAS J

What do you want? My mom will skin me alive

if she finds I'm out here.

VADA

Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo

tonight.

THOMAS J

I told you i'll get in trouble.

VADA

Pacifist!

THOMAS J

I am not.

VADA

Bed wetter!

THOMAS J

I stopped that!

HARRY

Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. For

instance, on a given night anybody can win,

but I play the odds, when choosing bingo

cards, I use a range of theories from the laws

of probability to avoiding duplicate number

systems. This way you get much more activity.

SHELLY

(hopeful)

Does it make it easier to win?

HARRY

No. Just, more activity.

HARRY

(as he sits down, to the

person next to him)

Hi Carl.

THOMAS J

They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.

VADA

We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.

THOMAS J

Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.

VADA

Duck!

SHELLY

(in the distance, as a number

is announced)

Oh great!

THOMAS J

Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.

VADA

Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.

SHELLY

(in the distance again, as

another number is announced)

Aarrggh.

SHELLY

I just had a terrible thought Harry.

HARRY

What's that?

SHELLY

I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these

people very soon.

HARRY

Why d'you think these seats were empty.

THOMAS J

Can we go yet?

VADA

Go???

THOMAS J

You know I'm not allowed outside my myself

after dark.

SHELLY

Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.

HARRY

Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending

upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with

10 cards could win just as easily as a guy

with 100.

SHELLY

Kinda like men.

HARRY

Oh, how do you mean?

SHELLY

You can be in a room with 100 men, and not

like any of them, or you can be in a room with

just one man, and he's exactly the one you

want.

VADA

(in semi-deep fake voice)

BINGO!

BINGO ANNOUNCER

We have a winner. Will the winner please

raise their hand?

CARL

There was no bingo, it came from outside.

VERNON

How could someone outside get a bingo?

CARL

Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone

outside yelled bingo you moron!

VERNON

Who are you calling a mowon?

(false teeth)

VERNON'S WIFE

Put a lid on it Vernon!

CARL

Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years

old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!!

HARRY

Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game.

VADA

We can go now.

SHELLY

I had a good time tonight.

HARRY

I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

SHELLY

Would you like to come in and see my house?

Just for a minute.

HARRY

Okay, sure.

SHELLY

Home sweet home.

HARRY

It's nice.

SHELLY

I did it myself. I read a magazine article

about how to maximize small spaces.

HARRY

Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.

SHELLY

You can look in the bathroom if you want.

People are always curious about that, like

what happens when you flush.

HARRY

Yeah.

SHELLY

Are you mad at me?

HARRY

No, why?

SHELLY

I don't know, tonight you just seemed a

little cool, not opening car doors and...

HARRY

Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice

on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of

touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not

since my wife died.

SHELLY

What happened to her?

HARRY

Ahh, complications during child birth, she

died two days after Vada was born.

SHELLY

Did she ever see Vada?

HARRY

I brought the baby into the room a couple of

times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think

she saw Vada. It was.....

Did I ruin this?

SHELLY

Dance with me?

HARRY

Here?

SHELLY

This is where we are.

HARRY

Is there enough room?

HARRY

I haven't danced in.....

SHELLY

In ages, I know, me neither.

HARRY

Rock?

SHELLY

See, you're not that out of touch.

(they dance)

You're good.

HARRY

At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot

date, I did a killer frugue.

SHELLY

What are you wearing?

HARRY

Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.

SHELLY

Do you want to?

HARRY

Want to what?

SHELLY

Kiss me.

HARRY

Yes.

SHELLY

Good.

SHELLY

Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very

optimistic.

HARRY

I ahh, better go.

SHELLY

It's only eight o'clock.

HARRY

Goodnight Shelly.

SHELLY

Goodnight.

SHELLY

Well, I guess it's official we had a date,

maybe we can play bingo again sometime.

HARRY

I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that

drive in of yours.

SHELLY

Goodnight.

MR. BIXLER

Before the class started, Ronda and Justin

wanted to lead the class in a group

meditation.

WOMAN

Ooooh that's really cool.

JUSTIN

Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes

out into the group.

RONDA

Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes.

Relax your muscles and take deep breaths.

JUSTIN

Now, try to feel what the other person is

feeling, without speaking any words, send out

your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at

the same time. Can you feel it?

RONDA

Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody

feel?

GUY

I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.

OTHER GUY

I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth,

she's so cosmically in tune.

RONDA

So right on, that's exactly what I sent out,

and I felt like, you were full of inner peace

and harmony.

MR. BIXLER

Vada, what did you feel.

VADA

I felt Justin's hangnail.

JUSTIN

No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a

hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul,

feel my aura.

VADA

I don't think I'm allowed to.

JUSTIN

I tell you what, let's try it again, hold

hands.

VADA'S THOUGHTS

Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe.

It got infected and traveled to her vocal

chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't

think Grammoo thought it was insignificant.

HARRY

Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get

lettuce.

SHELLY

Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.

VADA

Hi.

HARRY

I'm just picking some things up for the

barbecue.

SHELLY

Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?

HARRY

Not at all. Lot of potatoes!

SHELLY

It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.

HARRY

I'm looking forward to that.

HARRY

HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're

doing.

VADA

Sorry.

SHELLY

You know this is gonna be my first 4th of

July picnic in a long time.

HARRY

Really?

VADA

(picking up large can of

prunes)

Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL

bad?

HARRY

Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the

cart, anything at all.

(to Shelly)

I don't know what's gotten into her today.

VADA'S THOUGHTS

I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie

dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas

I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do

was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't

too upset when they took that wrong turn and

went over a cliff.

PHIL

Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to

use fewer briquettes and now look what you've

done. You've cremated them.

HARRY

That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??

PHIL

No, no no....

HARRY

Look if you think you know how, why don't you

pre-measure the briquettes in little packages,

put out a product, support me for a while!

SHELLY

How's it going chef?

HARRY

Okay.

VADA

Are they ready yet?

HARRY

No, sweetie, not yet.

VADA

When?

HARRY

Soon honey, soon.

(which there doesn't appear

to be anything wrong with)

VADA

When??

HARRY

In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll

burn your nose, look out.

SHELLY

Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.

HARRY

I'll second that.

VADA

Hey Shelly, like seafood?

SHELLY

Uh huh, why?

VADA

See food!

SHELLY

(laughing)

That's attractive.

SHELLY

(under her breath)

Oh shit! Excuse me...

MAN

Hey Shelly, who lives here?

(pointing at hearse)

The Addams Family?

SHELLY

Danny, what are you doing here?

DANNY

What am I doing here????? What am I doing

here?

SHELLY

(to other man in background)

Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?

DANNY

You told everybody where you were going, I'm

here for the motor home.

PHIL

These two people do not have a good

relationship.

SHELLY

(in background)

No! _I_ bought it, _I_ paid for it...

SHELLY

I've been living in it for over a year, the

camper is mine.

DANNY

Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the

lawyer said, it's supposed to be "OUR MUTUAL

ASSET", not "Shelly's recreational vehicle".

Gimme the keys.

SHELLY

Keep your voice down!

DANNY

What?

SHELLY

The boss is watching us...

DANNY

(sarcastic)

I'm impressed.

SHELLY

God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.

DANNY

Yeah, all right...

SHELLY

(Talking to Danny, pointing

at the people respectively)

This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada

Sultenfuss...

DANNY

Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.

VADA

(matter-of-fact)

I like my name.

SHELLY

(to the Sultenfuss')

This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino

Raphael salon in Detroit.

(pointing at Danny)

We used to be married.

VADA

(extremely hopeful, to Danny)

Are you here to take Shelly back?

HARRY

Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got

burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to

join us?

DANNY

Can't stay, I'm just here because my

wife.....

SHELLY

Ex...ex, ex...

DANNY

My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my

camper.

HARRY

Shelly?

SHELLY

Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I

promise.....

DANNY

I don't think so, I got a copy of the

property settlement right here.

Ahh Shit, this is my lease...... Damn it, I

keep forgetting things, I'm getting senile.

HARRY

Danny?

DANNY

WHAT?

HARRY

Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss,

and there's really nothing anyone can do to

comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the

times you had with the camper, the trips you

took, the sights you saw, those days are gone

now, but they'll live on in your heart

forever.

DANNY

(to Shelly)

This guy bonking you?

SHELLY

(disgusted)

Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!

HARRY

(to Danny)

Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.

DANNY

Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?

HARRY

It's her home! It's where she lives!!

DANNY

Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,

(to Shelly)

Gimme the goddam keys.

SHELLY

Stop it! That hurts!!

HARRY

Danny.....

RALPH

What'd you do that for??

HARRY

Who are you?

RALPH

I'm his brother.

HARRY

Oh then you'll probably be visiting us here

quite often.

RALPH

WHY??

HARRY

Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's

camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front

yard.

PHIL

(quiet voice, to Vada)

Your father is a savage.

SHELLY

Bye Ralph.

SHELLY

(to Harry)

Well, you were pretty great!

HARRY

Is it really your camper?

SHELLY

Can we see it from the back yard?

HARRY

You can get the general idea...

HARRY

Yep, there they are... They always look the

same every year...

SHELLY

HARRY

Did you ahh, love him?

SHELLY

I would never marry anybody I didn't love.

VADA

He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit

anyone in his life.

PHIL

He likes her.

VADA

Does he love her?

PHIL

Probably.

VADA

Do you like her?

PHIL

Yes I do, and I think she's very good for

your father.

VADA

Why?

PHIL

After your mother died, he was sad all the

time, but before that, he was pretty funny.

VADA

Really?

PHIL

Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he

seems like the old Harry.

VADA

My Dad was funny?

PHIL

Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but

he made me laugh.

VADA'S THOUGHTS

My Uncle fought in the Korean war, he had a

steel plate put in his head, Daddy said he

didn't come back the same, one night, he

picked up a radio station from Oklahoma in his

teeth, it was really neat.

VADA

Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.

VADA

(with stick in mouth)

Carnnk yu sheeee ik??

VADA

Can't you see it?

DR WELTY

No.

VADA

It's there.

DR WELTY

Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your

throat.

VADA

Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours?

NURSE RANDALL

So you fill it with water like this, and what

have you got? A water gun.

THOMAS J

Cool, can I get one for Vada?

NURSE RANDALL

Oh yes, yes.

Thomas, let me ask you a question. Does Vada

ever tell you why she comes down here so much?

THOMAS J

Cause she's dying.

NURSE RANDALL

Do you think she is?

THOMAS J

No.

NURSE RANDALL

Why do you think she says that?

THOMAS J

Cause she gets scared of all those dead

people in her house, and you know that saying,

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if

she's one of them, she won't be as scared.

NURSE RANDALL

You know what I think? I think Vada's very

lucky to have a friend like you.

THOMAS J

She's my best friend.

NURSE RANDALL

Miss Vada, how are you feeling?

VADA

As good as can be expected.

THOMAS J

Hey Vada, guess what we got?

VADA

What?

THOMAS J

THIS!!

(squirt)

VADA

HEY YOU!!!!

(squirt)

I'm gonna get you!!!

(squirt)

I'll get you!!!!

THOMAS J

Woah!!

VADA

What?

THOMAS J

VADA

So?

THOMAS J

Stand back.

VADA

Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!

THOMAS J

You're right, let's knock it down.

VADA

What do you want it for anyway?

THOMAS J

For their meat.

THOMAS J

Got it!

VADA

My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!

THOMAS J

They're alive!! Run for your life!!!

THOMAS J

Run faster they're after us!!

VADA

I am running faster!!

THOMAS J

Hurry!!!

VADA

Jump in the water!!

THOMAS J

But I have my clothes on!

VADA

Do it!

HARRY

(in the distance, from

upstairs)

Vada is that you?

VADA

Yes..

HARRY

Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival

tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.

HARRY

Shelly's coming with us.

SHELLY

So Vada, what's your favorite ride?

VADA

I like the freak show.

HARRY

I know, I know, let's go on the "sit on the

bench and rest" ride.

SHELLY

I don't think that that roller coaster agreed

with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have

to watch what you eat here, I remember one

time I went to a carnival with my cousins

David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs,

and the next day they came down with

nephritis.

VADA

Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't

get it from hot dogs.

SHELLY

Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next

day they had really high fevers, and their

faces got very fat. They baffled medical

science, they were in a magazine.

SHELLY

They were!! "Popular Mechanics", no "Popular

Science". I don't know, popular.

SHELLY

Oh look they're trying to hit that poor

thing.

HARRY

Watch you don't knock out a fish.

SHELLY

Perfect.

HARRY

I don't know which ball's mine.

VADA

I won, I won!!!

SHELLY

Oh great!!

ATTENDANT

Hooray, we have a winner,

(picks up fish in plastic

bag)

There you go little girl.

(gives fish to Vada)

See how easy it is folks!

SHELLY

Oh Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish.

VADA

Where'd you get that ring?

VADA

(extremely hopeful)

Did you win it?

SHELLY

Vada we have something to tell you. Harry?

HARRY

Vada we have some good news, Shelly and I are

getting married.

VADA

Oh my fish!!!

HARRY

We're having the wedding sometime near the

end of the summer.

VADA

SHELLY

Vada? Would you like us to get you another

goldfish?

VADA

(angry)

NO!, He's fine.

(less angry, talking to fish)

Fish are very resilient animals you know.

Don't worry, I won't get another fish.

ANNOUNCER

THE BUMPER CARS!! THE BUMPER CARS!! FOR JUST

50 CENTS A HALF DOLLAR, FIVE DIMES, 10

NICKELS, WE HAVE A RIDE THAT'S GUARANTEED TO

REARRANGE ALL OF YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS.

SHELLY

Oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival

and not ride the bumper cars.

HARRY

I fall asleep at the wheel.

VADA

(malicious grin)

I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!

SHELLY

Oh great Vada, come on...

SHELLY

(to the attendant)

Uhh, two.

(to Vada)

I got the blue one!!

VADA

NO!

SHELLY

Yes!!

SHELLY

(pointing at Vada)

I am gonna get you.

HARRY

Vada, keep your hands on the wheel!!

HARRY

Careful Vada, careful.

HARRY

Shelly LOOK OUT!

MRS. SENNETT

Hi Vada.

VADA

Hi, can Thomas J come out?

MRS. SENNETT

Sure, come in.

THOMAS J

Hi Vada.

VADA

Hi, wanna ride bikes?

THOMAS J

Sure.

MRS. SENNETT

Ohh, did you make your bed?

THOMAS J

Yes.

MRS. SENNETT

You're sure?

THOMAS J

It's made.

MRS. SENNETT

Come here, you've got a milk mustache.

THOMAS J

Come on, let's go.

VADA

Bye Mrs. Sennett.

THOMAS J

Bye Ma.

MRS. SENNETT

Have fun kids.

VADA

I'm running away.

THOMAS J

Where you running to?

VADA

California, I'm going to Hollywood to live

with the Brady Bunch.

THOMAS J

I wanna live with them too.

VADA

No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll

have to live with the Partridge Family.

THOMAS J

Really?

THOMAS J

That's it.

VADA

Get up!?

THOMAS J

I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past

this place two times already. We're not

getting nowhere.

THOMAS J

Why are you running away?

VADA

My Dad gave Shelly a ring.

THOMAS J

Wow, was it a decoder ring?

VADA

You're such a retard, it was an engagement

ring.

THOMAS J

They're getting married?

THOMAS J

So now you'll have a mother.

VADA

I don't like her.

THOMAS J

I do, she's real funny.

VADA

He likes her better than me.

THOMAS J

I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.

VADA

Then go home, baby.

THOMAS J

I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.

VADA

Leave then, some friend you are.

THOMAS J

You can come to my house for dinner?

VADA

No, I'm hiding out.

THOMAS J

Okay, seeya.

VADA'S THOUGHTS

In social studies we learned some people

stole the Limburg baby right out of his house,

I think i'll sleep with my window OPEN

tonight.

VADA

OH MY GOD!!!

VADA

DADDY!! Daddy daddy!!!! Daddy!!??!?!

VADA

Daddy??!?!?!

SHELLY

Vada, Vada, what's the matter?

VADA

Where's Daddy?

SHELLY

Well he just left, what's wrong?

VADA

I'm hemorrhaging.

SHELLY

What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?

VADA

(very weak, scared voice)

I don't want, I don't need your help....

SHELLY

Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?

SHELLY

How old are you?

VADA

I'm eleven and a half.

SHELLY

It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have

a little talk.

VADA

My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?

SHELLY

It's actually a very beautiful thing, and

look there wouldn't have been a Vada.

VADA

I think it should be outlawed.

SHELLY

Believe me, some day, you'll feel

differently.

VADA

Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna

see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to

boys.

THOMAS J

Hi Vada, can you come out?

VADA

I dunno..

THOMAS J

Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go

swimming?

VADA

NO!

Get outta here!! And don't come back for five

to seven days!!!

VADA

Grammoo, I'm going to the bathroom, i'll be

right back.

GRAMMOO

It's quarter to three, there's no-one in the

place, just you and me.

So santa-macho, I got a little story you

oughtta know, we're comin' my friend, to the

end of a brief episode, so make it one for my

baby and one more for the road.

HARRY

I'm so sorry, it's all right ma, I'm very

very sorry.

HARRY

Now what were you thinking, huh? HUH???? It's

your responsibility to watch her!! Do you have

any idea how upset those people are in

there???!

VADA

Why do you think people want to get married?

THOMAS J

Well when you get older, you just have to.

VADA

I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.

THOMAS J

You can't marry a teacher, it's against the

law.

VADA

It is not.

THOMAS J

Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's

and it won't be fair.

VADA

Not true.

VADA

(nervously, uncertain)

Have you ever kissed anyone?

THOMAS J

Like they do on TV?

VADA

Uh huh.

THOMAS J

No.

VADA

Maybe we should, just to see what's the big

deal.

THOMAS J

But, I don't know how.

VADA

Here, practice on your arm like this.

THOMAS J

Like this?

VADA

Uh huh.

(they kiss their arms for a

while)

Okay, enough practice.

VADA

Close your eyes.

THOMAS J

But then I won't be able to see anything.

VADA

Just do it.

THOMAS J

Okay, okay.

VADA

Okay on the count of three.

VADA

One.

VADA

Two.

VADA

Two and a half.

VADA

Three.

VADA

Say something it's too quiet.

THOMAS J

Umm, Ummmmm

VADA

(agitated)

Just, hurry.

THOMAS J

On political agents to the flag of the United

States of America,

THOMAS J & VADA

And to the republic for which it stands, one

nation, under God, individual, with liberty

and justice for all.

VADA

You better not tell anyone.

THOMAS J

You better not either.

VADA

Well, let's spit on it.

THOMAS J

Okay.

VADA

Seeya tomorrow.

THOMAS J

Okay, seeya.

(Vada starts off down the

road)

Vada?

VADA

What?

THOMAS J

Would you think of me?

VADA

For what?

THOMAS J

Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

VADA

I guess.

THOMAS J

(as he finds the mood ring)

Yes!

THOMAS J

(reacting to the bees)

Ow, ahh, NO!, Get away!!!

HARRY

Hi Vada.

VADA

Hi.

HARRY

What are you doing.

VADA

Feeding my fish.

HARRY

Is that the fish you won at the carnival?

VADA

Yes.

HARRY

He's getting big.

(sad pause)

Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.

HARRY

Vada, something happened to Thomas J last

night, he stepped on a beehive.

VADA

(beginning to look worried)

I told him not to tease those bees. Did he

get stung?

VADA

Maybe I should go over and yell at him.

HARRY

No sweetheart, you can't.

VADA

(looking very worried)

Why not?

HARRY

He was allergic to bees.

VADA

(extremely worried)

He's okay isn't he?

HARRY

(shakes head, near tears)

There were just too many of 'em.

VADA

Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??

DR WELTY

Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?

VADA

I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.

DR WELTY

Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look,

come up here and we'll have a look.

VADA

It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.

DR WELTY

What Hurts Vada?

VADA

The bee stings! I can't breathe!

SHELLY

I'm leaving some food for you by the door, in

case you get hungry.

SHELLY

Hi.

JUDY

Hi, is Vada home?

SHELLY

Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's

not seeing anyone.

JUDY

Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I

wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.

SHELLY

Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of

days.

JUDY

Will you tell her I came by?

SHELLY

Sure.

JUDY

Thank you. Bye.

SHELLY

Bye.

REV

Hi Harry.

HARRY

Ahh, Reverand Miles.

REV

The Sennetts want to thank you for taking

care of things so quickly.

SHELLY

(knocks)

Vada? I see you took your tray in,

Maybe you should come down for the funeral,

sometimes it helps. Vada?

SHELLY

She won't come out. It's been a whole day.

You have to do something Harry.

HARRY

The funeral's starting.

SHELLY

Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her

only friend in the world is dead.

HARRY

I know that, but what do you want from me?

SHELLY

Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I

first came here, the idea of working with dead

people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I

saw a family lived here, I thought, "if I'm

living without a family, at least I can work

with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be

invited in for supper."

HARRY

Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted

because there's a car crash, or there's a

fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.

SHELLY

I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those

people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't

ignore the living, especially your daughter.

ARTHUR

Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the minister's about

to begin.

HARRY

Thank you Arthur.

MINISTER

We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett. He

was born, May 7 1961, in Madison,

Pennsylvania, and he was survived by his

loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett......

(fades as camera changes)

MINISTER

The family has asked me to say a few words

before we proceed. No words that I could say,

would begin to describe the loss and grieving,

one word that keeps ringing in my ear is

Why?. Why would God choose to take this

little boy from us? I can't give you an answer

to that question, but I can tell you that God

has chosen Thomas J for some very special

reason, we must find solace in knowing that

Thomas J is now in Gods care. In that face,

there is no sorrow such as....

MINISTER

....disciples began to chastise them, and

Jesus said "Let the children come to me, do

not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God

belongs to such as these.

(the minister notices Vada

coming around the front of the

room)

He laid his hands on their heads before he

left that place, let us pray in silence.

VADA

Wanna go tree climbing Thomas J?

VADA

His face hurts, and where is his glasses? He

can't see without his glasses! Put his glasses

on!

(Harry and Shelly are rapidly

approaching Vada, Shelly takes

hold of her and tries to pull

her away)

Put on his glasses! He was gonna be an

acrobat.

HARRY

He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!

VADA

Get away, get away!!

HARRY

Vada wait! Vada! Vada!!

MR. BIXLER

Vada! I was just on my way to your house. Are

you all right? I'm so sorry about Thomas J.

MR. BIXLER

Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him,

Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him,

it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?

VADA

(crying)

Justin and Ronda say that I should tell

people what I feel.

MR. BIXLER

(nods)

Come here, sit down over here.

VADA

Mr. Bixler,

(emotional pause)

I love you.

MR. BIXLER

Oh, Vada...

VADA

I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna

live here.

MR. BIXLER

VADA

No he wouldn't, I can't go home.

SUZANNE

I'll be ready in a second, I just can't seem

to find my other earring....

MR. BIXLER

Suzanne, this is Vada.

SUZANNE

(comes over to Vada and

crouches)

Vada, hi, I'm really sorry.

MR. BIXLER

Could you just give us a minute?

SUZANNE

Yeah.

VADA

Who's that?

MR. BIXLER

That's Suzanne.

(pause)

She and I are gonna be married this Fall.

VADA

No....

MR. BIXLER

I...I was gonna bring her to class next week.

I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please

honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada,

Vada sweetheart don't.....

VADA

Get away from me!

VADA'S THOUGHTS

Why do you think people wanna get married?

THOMAS J'S VOICE

When you get old, you just have to.

THOMAS J'S VOICE

Who's that with your Dad?

VADA'S THOUGHTS

It's my mother.

THOMAS J'S VOICE

I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.

(pause)

Vada, would you think of me? Well if you

don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

VADA'S THOUGHTS

Now we're blood brothers for life.

POLICEMAN

Shelly I'm sorry but we haven't found her

yet.

SHELLY

It's dark, she can't be alone in the dark.

POLICEMAN

We'll keep looking.

SHELLY

We, no, we've been looking since this

morning, her teacher called, and he said that

she went there first.....

POLICEMAN

I know, I know you told us.

SHELLY

But I....

SHELLY

Vada. Are you okay?

(Vada nods)

Oh God.

VADA

I should have told Thomas J that he was my

best friend.

SHELLY

I'm sure he knew.

VADA

Shelly, I stole some money from your cookie

jar, to pay for the writing class.

SHELLY

It's okay sweetheart.

VADA

I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll

ever go to class again.

SHELLY

I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first

book to me, and we'll forget about the whole

thing.

VADA

I will I promise.

SHELLY

Okay, get in to bed.

SHELLY

Goodnight.

VADA

Goodnight.

SHELLY

(sitting on stairs)

She's in.

VADA

Did I kill my mother?

HARRY

What??

VADA

The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my

mother.

HARRY

No, no.

HARRY

No sweetie that wasn't your fault, things

like that aren't anybody's fault, it just

happened.

VADA

I found this.

HARRY

I forgot about that picture, where did you

find it?

VADA

In the garage.

HARRY

Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers

favorite car.

VADA

What was my mama like?

HARRY

She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes.

Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when

you laugh, you sound just like her.

VADA

Really?

HARRY

Uh huh. You know what your mother did when

she found out she was gonna have you? She came

home and painted this whole room pink. She was

so sure she was gonna have a little girl.

VADA

Do you miss her?

HARRY

Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and

even now, I get a little sad when I think of a

pretty flower or a sunset that your mother

would have liked.

VADA

I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll

think of Thomas J.

HARRY

That's good, memories are good sweetheart.

Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from

you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and

I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump

like me.

(Vada puts the photo back

under her pillow, Harry gets

up and kisses her)

Seeya in the morning.

VADA

Daddy, it's not so bad to be like you.

HARRY

Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?

MRS. SENNETT

Some days I think i'll be okay, others, well

I have to force myself even to get out of bed,

I know it's crazy, but sometimes I think he's

just away at summer camp. How's Vada?

HARRY

Oh she's doing much better. Ahh she's just

inside.

(walks over to entrance)

VADA!

VADA

Mrs. Sennett.

(she runs and gives her a

hug)

MRS. SENNETT

Vada. I've been wanting to come over to see

you,

(she reaches inside her purse

and gets out something, it is

Vada's mood ring)

Thomas J had this on him, I thought you might

like to have it.

You were such a good friend to him, I hope

you'll still come by and visit me.

VADA

I will, I promise.

VADA

Mrs. Sennett.

(she stops and turns around

to look at Vada)

Thomas J will be all right, my mother will

take care of him.

MRS. SENNETT

Thank you Vada.

MR. BIXLER

(reading from book)

Encased in talent, like a uniform, the rank

of every poet, is well known. They can amaze

us like a thunderstorm, or die so young, or

live for years alone. My advice to you on our

last class, be a thunderstorm.

JUSTIN

What exactly do you mean by that?

MR. BIXLER

I mean, be dangerous

(Vada enters the back of the

room)

And unpredictable. And make a lot of noise.

MR. BIXLER

Vada.

JUSTIN

Hey, we missed you man! Gimme a hug!

MR. BIXLER

I was hoping you'd stop by today.

VADA

I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.

MR. BIXLER

We'd love to hear it.

VADA

Weeping willow with your tears running down,

Why do you always weep and frown, Is it

because he left you one day, Is it because he

could not stay, On your branches he would

swing, Do you long for the happiness that they

would bring, He found shelter in your shade,

He thought his laughter would never fade,

Weeping willow stop your tears, There is

something to calm your fears, You think death

as if you forever part, But I know he'll

always be in your heart.

VADA

Hi Judy.

JUDY

Hi Vada.

VADA'S THOUGHTS

Things are a little better these days; I

finally swallowed that chicken bone, Judy and

I are gonna be in the same home room and the

republican party just re-nominated Mr. Nixon.
