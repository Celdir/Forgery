PHIL

Hello?

WOMAN'S VOICE

Oh my God please help me! I

found your number in his pocket

and I don't know... I don't know

what to do.

PHIL'S VOICE

Ah, what... who are you?

WOMAN'S VOICE

He's dead... he's dead... and

I'm... just... I don't know what

to do.

PHIL'S VOICE

Hold on.   Tell me who's dead.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Parsons. Gram Parsons. We met

in a bar and we had a lot to

drink and he just...

PHIL'S VOICE

Are you sure he's dead?

3.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Yeah. He's really dead.    He

just...

PHIL'S VOICE

Listen. Call an ambulance.

Where are you?

WOMAN'S VOICE

Joshua Tree. Joshua Tree Inn.

Room eight.

PHIL'S VOICE

Have you got a car?

WOMAN'S VOICE

Yes.

PHIL'S VOICE

Call an ambulance. Then get out

of there. Okay? Okay?

WOMAN'S VOICE

Yeah, okay. I'm goin'...

NURSE

You wanna run that by me again,

sir?

PHIL

Okay. I'd like to see Gram

Parsons.

4.

NURSE

You want to see Gram Parsons?

PHIL

Yes. Alone, if possible. And

would you have a gurney standing

by in case I need to move him?

NURSE

And you are.... his physician?

Or perhaps a close relative?

PHIL

Actually, I'm his road manager.

NURSE

So you're not his physician or a

close relative?

PHIL

No.

NURSE

Mister Parsons is awaiting a post

mortem. He will then be

delivered to his family. I

suggest you speak to them if you

wish to pick through his personal

effects. Sir.

PHIL

Now listen here...

NURSE

No, you listen here. Mister

Parsons is dead and no longer

appears to need a road manager.

Which makes two of us.

5.

PHIL

Sheesh!

PHIL (CONT'D)

Hello buddy. How you been?

PHIL (CONT'D)

Well, I can't stand around here

chatting with you all day.

Things to do...

DOCTOR

Can I help you?

PHIL

Naw, I'm cool thanks.

DOCTOR

What are you doing?

PHIL

Just taking some stiff down to

neurology.

6.

DOCTOR

We don't have a neurology

department.

PHIL

Urology.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Okay. Just hold your horses -

I'll go check the paperwork.

DOCTOR

I have the paperwork.

PHIL

No. You have your paperwork. I

need to go check my paperwork.

DOCTOR

Hello?   Hello...

7.

SUSIE

Guess who?

PHIL

Martin Luther King.

SUSIE

Try again...

PHIL

This.... ...isn't.... ...the

best time... ...Baby....

SUSIE

God damn!     I'm so sorry, baby.

PHIL

Yeah, out of a job again.

SUSIE

Would never have happened if you

were there.

PHIL

How do you know I wasn't?

SUSIE

Well, if you were, you wouldn't

have let him die.

PHIL

I was still 'on staff'. He was

still my responsibility.

8.

PHIL (CONT'D)

So where have you been, anyway?

PHIL (CONT'D)

How long this time? Two weeks?

SUSIE

Yeah, let's have this

conversation again. Like you

haven't just done six weeks on

the road...

PHIL

Yeah, but I usually leave a note.

And there's a paycheck involved.

SUSIE

Come here...

PHIL

What's this?

SUSIE

This is a remembrance.

SERIES OF

SHOTS:

GIRL

(Earnestly)

He was so beautiful, and he

understood what my heart was

feeling. I'll...

(MOR E)

9.

GIR L (CONT'D)

never laugh again. My inner joy

has gone. It evaporated when

Gram departed.

EXPERT

He sang country music in a way

that it had never been sung

before. It was 'country rock',

if you like. And it was kinda

catchy. At least, the young

people seemed to lap it up. It's

fair to say that when Gram

Parsons died, he died a star.

HIPPIE

It's like... I can't... It was

real, kinda... I... Oh, man.

REPORTER

And another light burns out in

the desert. Gram Parsons - the

standard bearer of the new

country music movement - is dead,

following an overdose of drugs.

While many of America's young

people are today in mourning,

their parents will view this as

another example of how today's

drug culture can so easily claim

a life. We'll leave you tonight

with the young man's own words.

Gram Parsons wrote a song called

'In My Hour of Darkness', which

contains these words: 'In my hour

of darkness...'

GRAM'S VOICE

In my hour of darkness, in my

time of need, Oh Lord grant me

vision, Oh Lord grant me speed.

Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord

grant me speed.

10.

PHIL

Hello.

SUSIE

Hi.

PHIL

When you're here, I spend my time

wondering when you're going. And

when you're back, I wonder where

you've been.

SUSIE

Phil, you give me laughs and a

great time. But I'm not sure if

that's enough.

PHIL

You mean there's more than that?

SUSIE

Yes, there's more than that!

There's dependable, responsible,

reliable...

11.

PHIL

There's dull, boring, normal.

You should hook up with someone

who works in a bank. I know a

guy, actually. He has fish for

dinner every Friday, cleans his

shoes twice a week and buys his

ties in bulk because it works out

cheaper that way. I'll put you

in touch.

SUSIE

I don't mind loving a crazy

bastard, Phil. But you've got to

be for something and not just

against everything. You have to

choose something to represent.

PHIL

I represent the combined forces

of charm, enchantment and

exuberance.

SUSIE

Your job is to arrange other

people's lives. Maybe it's time

to put a little thought into your

own.

MAN

Airport, please.

PHIL

Long time, no see, Barbara.

12.

BARBARA

Don't try and schmooze me,

Kaufman, you repellent slimeball.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

The latest victim?

PHIL

Meet Barbara.

BARBARA

It's a lot tidier than I

remember.

SUSIE

Who the hell is she?

PHIL

Gram's ex-girlfriend.

SUSIE

Girlfriend? Isn't he married?

BARBARA

Welcome to the seventies.

PHIL

What do you want, Barbara?

BARBARA

I'm here to fulfill Gram's

wishes.

PHIL

That's nice. I have no idea what

you're talking about.

13.

BARBARA

Do you know what this is?

BARBARA (CONT'D)

It's Gram's will.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

To whom it may concern: I would

like it to be known that it is my

wish to leave Barbara Mansfield

my assets and belongings in the

event of my death. Signed:

Ingram Cecil Parsons.

PHIL

Did he write that with joined up

writing or was it before he knew

how?

BARBARA

Still the jester Kaufman, and

still very unfunny.

PHIL

That's not a will Barbara, and

you know it.

BARBARA

It's better than a will,

actually. It's a signed promise

from Gram to leave me all his

assets and belongings. And

anyway, it's really none of your

business what this is. I've come

for the guitar.

PHIL

Guitar?

BARBARA

Yes. Gram's guitar.   He always

kept it here.

PHIL

It's been a while since you were

around, Barbara.

(MOR E)

14.

PHI L (CONT'D)

Gretchen, his wife, took it back

six months ago.

BARBARA

I don't believe you, Kaufman.

PHIL

Hey, well done. You found the

only unbroken thing.

SUSIE

Why did you let her in?

PHIL

It's all part of the grieving

process.

SUSIE

How can she behave that way?

Gram's not even in the ground

yet.

SUSIE (CONT'D)

What?

PHIL

Nothing.

SUSIE

Don't you freak out on me.

PHIL

Do me a favor and get the guitar,

sweetheart.

15.

SUSIE

Where are you going?

PHIL

(O.S)

I gotta make a call.

UNDERTAKER

Afternoon.     Joshua Tree

Obsequies.

PHIL

(into phone)

Obsequies? What the hell does

that mean? I'm...

UNDERTAKER

It's Latin. It means burial. Is

there anything I can help with?

Who am I speaking to?

PHIL

Yes, you can help me as a matter

of fact. I am...

UNDERTAKER

Mister Parsons? I'm sorry, I'll

take a look immediately.

16.

UNDERTAKER (CONT'D)

Yeah, he was here.

UNDERTAKER (CONT'D)

New Orleans. Although he only

just went, so he'll still be on

his way to Los Angeles Airport.

Big thrill for us here, as we're

only a small facility. Nearly

got Jane Mansfield in '67 when

she passed through, but she got

diverted to Frisco. Hello?

UNDERTAKER (CONT'D)

Hello.    Hellooo...

SUSIE

(O.S)

Phil?

SUSIE

What are you doing?

PHIL

These things aren't that big.

SUSIE

Okay.    Is that a problem?

PHIL

Not really.

17.

SUSIE

Well, that's good.

SUSIE (CONT'D)

So what are you up to?

PHIL

It's best you don't know.

SUSIE

I don't know what this madness

is, but I'm not getting involved.

PHIL

Well, that's the point.

SUSIE

I mean, I don't know what it is

you're planning, but I'm not

bailing you out again.

PHIL

Right.

SUSIE

I'm going.

PHIL

Again.

SUSIE

This time, I'm not coming back.

SUSIE (CONT'D)

I'm going to find a man who buys

his ties in bulk.

18.

PHIL

(O.S)

Hello? Anyone there?

PHIL (CONT'D)

(O.S)

There you are. I'm looking for

Larry Osterberg.

LARRY

The door is unlocked.

PHIL

You Larry Osterberg?

LARRY

Yes.   Welcome to my house.

PHIL

Very nice.     What's that noise?

LARRY

Manomanjari on the sitar by

Nikhil Banerjee.

(NB. Similar music may

be used in this scene)

Phil stares at him.

19.

PHIL

(carefully)

Okay.

LARRY

There's no smoking in here, I'm

afraid.

PHIL

Right.

LARRY

Who are you, please?

PHIL

Oh, I'm Phil Kaufman.

LARRY

And how may I help you, Phil

Kaufman?

PHIL

I'd like to hire your car.

LARRY

Why?

PHIL

Well, I need to pick someone up

at the airport.

LARRY

Don't you know anyone with a car?

PHIL

Yes, of course. It's just that

I'm told your car is more

suitable.

LARRY

I see. In what way is my car

more suitable?

PHIL

Well... it's a hearse.

LARRY

Yes.

20.

LARRY (CONT'D)

And how is a hearse going to be

suitable for picking someone up

from the airport?

PHIL

It's... a joke.

LARRY

A joke?

PHIL

A prank.   A surprise.

LARRY

Well, okay. Is it two hundred

dollars worth of surprise?

PHIL

No, it's more of a fifty dollar

surprise.

LARRY

I can lend you a bicycle.

Besides, the car is booked.

PHIL

Booked how?

MAN

I use it to carry equipment for a

band.

PHIL

Well, here's two hundred dollars

to unbook it. Let 'em carry

their own trombones.

PHIL (CONT'D)

You don't need to count it.   You

could trust me.

LARRY

Let's see; I've never met you in

my life, you shout through my

mail slot, you want to hire my

hearse as a joke, and...

(MOR E)

21.

LAR RY (CONT'D)

you're twenty dollars short.   Why

should I trust you?

PHIL

That last twenty is for gas.

Anyway - I haven't even seen the

car yet. I'm the one who's

operating on trust.

LARRY

It's a hearse. What else do you

need to know?

LARRY

Meet Bernice.

PHIL

Bernice?

LARRY

Bernice is a Cadillac Superior

Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral

Coach. We've got a Seven gallon

V8 engine offering three hundred

and forty bhp at four thousand

six hundred revolutions per

minute. You're looking at a

twenty one feet beauty with a one

hundred and fifty six inch

wheelbase containing a four

barrel Rochester Quadrajet

carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic

transmission. Bernice weighs

over six thousand pounds.

PHIL

It's yellow.

LARRY

Yes, it's yellow.    Bernice comes

in yellow.

PHIL

It's supposed to be black.

LARRY

But they're all black.

22.

PHIL

That might be my point.

LARRY

So how is a yellow hearse covered

with flowers less of a surprise

than a black hearse?

PHIL

I paid you two hundred dollars

for a black hearse.

LARRY

(patiently)

No, you paid me a hundred and

eighty dollars for a hearse, and

a hearse is what you've got. If

you take a long, hard look at

Bernice, you'll see that she's

one of a kind. She's big, she's

fast, she's comfortable, and

she's beautiful. But she's not

black.

PHIL

Okay.   Where are the keys?

LARRY

Why?

PHIL

I gotta go.

LARRY

Oh, no. She doesn't go anywhere

without me.

PHIL

Okay.   Well, let's boogie.

23.

LARRY

Someone stole her last summer.

PHIL

Well, I've paid top dollar, so

it's nice to see I'm getting the

best...

LARRY

How did you hear of Bernice and

me?

PHIL

You are famous throughout the

greater Los Angeles area.

PHIL (CONT'D)

But you are the only guy with a

hearse. Don't go getting carried

away...

PHIL

Pull over.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Shit.

24.

LARRY

What's the matter?

PHIL

Nothing.

LARRY

Well... What flight are they on?

PHIL

We'll wait here.

LARRY

Okay. Well, what time is the

flight due?

PHIL

Soon.

LARRY

Okay.   How soon?

PHIL

Why do you ask so many damn

questions?

LARRY

Well... I don't know.

LARRY (CONT'D)

Shouldn't we be at arrivals?

PHIL

Look, will you please shut up

asking me stuff?

LARRY

Okay.

LARRY (CONT'D)

So how long are we going to wait?

PHIL

Morning.

25.

LARRY

Morning?   What do you mean,

morning?

PHIL

We'll make the pick-up in the

morning.

LARRY

You wait till morning.   I'm going

home.

LARRY

I'm only back because I don't

trust you with Bernice. I don't

even know you, and if you think

I'm going to leave my car with

you and just walk away, then

you've got another thought on the

way.

LARRY (CONT'D)

I'm staying right here. Where I

can keep an eye on things...

26.

DRIVER

Hey, lady!

BARBARA

Yes?

DRIVER

You... should be careful.

BARBARA

Why, thank you...

STANLEY

Parsons.

CHECK-IN CLERK

You've just arrived from New

Orleans, mister Parsons?

STANLEY

Yes.

CHECK-IN CLERK

And you're flying directly back

to New Orleans? On the same

plane?

STANLEY

That is correct.

CHECK-IN CLERK

Okay. Well, enjoy your stay at

Los Angeles Airport, Mister

Parsons.

27.

STANLEY

Thank you.

STANLEY (CONT'D)

I've come to pick up my son's

body.

STANLEY (CONT'D)

My son died out here, you see?

So I've come to bring him home.

STANLEY (CONT'D)

I'm wondering if that's enough

information for you?

CHECK-IN CLERK

Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. We'll...

see to it that you get every

assistance on your journey, sir.

STANLEY

Most kind.

BARBARA

I'd like to see the manager,

please.

CUSTOMER

Wait your turn.

BARBARA

I'm sorry. It's just that the

man I loved died yesterday. I

was forgetting my manners...

CUSTOMER

I'm sorry.     Please... go ahead.

28.

BARBARA

The manager?

CLERK

Can I help you?

PHIL

I'm here to pick up a... coffin.

CLERK

No you're not.

PHIL

Yes I am.

CLERK

No. You're here to pick up a

casket.

PHIL

Okay.   A casket.

CLERK

What flight number?

29.

PHIL

It   was due out on the next flight

to   New Orleans, but I'm driving

it   now. The stiff doesn't like

to   fly.

CLERK

You're one of those funny guys,

right.

PHIL

Yeah, but it's my day off.

CLERK

Name?

PHIL

Mine or the...?

CLERK

The deceased.

PHIL

Parsons.

CLERK

Barney - bring up Parsons.

BANK MANAGER

I simply can't give you any money

based on this piece of paper.

BARBARA

It's not a piece of paper. It's

a promise from Gram to leave me

all his money.

BANK MANAGER

Well, I'm sorry, but it's highly

likely that the estate will go to

probate and be divided up

accordingly, subject to a valid

will existing.

30.

BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)

Mister Parsons was a customer of

ours. We can't just pass his

money across to someone who says

they're in the will. There

are... rules.

BARBARA

You don't seem to understand.

These are his wishes.

BANK MANAGER

No... I do... understand, Miss

Mansfield. Really I do.

BARBARA

Please tell me how I'm supposed

to get my money.

BANK MANAGER

Well I imagine that you first

need to prove that mister Parsons

is actually dead.

BARBARA

Are you saying that I'm lying?

BANK MANAGER

No, absolutely not. But getting

a copy of the death certificate

would probably be a good first

step.

P. J. GAMBRELL

Paw on the space, don'tcha think?

31.

STANLEY

I'm sorry?

P. J. GAMBRELL

P J Gambrell, at yer assistance.

Pernell Jayson. Jes' saying paw

on the space in dese buckets.

STANLEY

Stanley Parsons.

P. J. GAMBRELL

Gowna be a trip. Besta know yer

otherwise gowna be a slow one.

STANLEY

Yes.   I suppose so.

CLERK

Papers?

PHIL

They'll be along. With this

being a rush job, they said you'd

understand.

CLERK

Well, you'd better tell them that

we've got rules.

CLERK (CONT'D)

And this is the exception which

proves that particular rule.

CLERK (CONT'D)

Although you don't need to tell

them that.

32.

CLERK (CONT'D)

And this... is your deceased.

CLERK

Good luck with her.

COP

Excuse me, sir.    Is that your

hearse?

LARRY

Hearse?

COP

That hearse.

LARRY

That hearse?

COP

Are you okay, sir?

LARRY

Okay?   Sure...

33.

PJ GAMBRELL

Jes sayin' 'bout the space.

STANLEY

Yes.

PJ GAMBRELL

Space ma game, kinda.

Partitions. Fixed. Slidin'.

Demountable. Integrated.

STANLEY

Right.

PJ GAMBRELL

Always say. Why have one room?

When you can have two?

STANLEY

I see.

PJ GAMBRELL

What's your bidness?

PHIL

Yup.   That's a she.

CLERK

And yours is supposed to be male?

PHIL

Yeah...

34.

CLERK

Well...    Gone.

PHIL

Gone?    Whaddya mean, gone?

CLERK

We got the wrong box.      Your box

is being loaded.

PHIL

Nice work.     So how do I get my

box back?

PHIL (CONT'D)

You're a damn thief.

CLERK

That's very hurtful.

CLERK (CONT'D)

Barney.    You receiving?

COP

So, whatcha doin' here?

LARRY

Doing?    Here?

STANLEY

What the hell?

STANLEY (CONT'D)

Excuse me.

PJ GAMBRELL

Why?

35.

STANLEY

I need to get off the plane.

PJ GAMBRELL

Sheesh.    Only jes' got settled.

PHIL

Can you speed things up?

CLERK

What's the hurry?

PHIL

I'd like to get to the Joshua

Tree while it's still light.

CLERK

I thought you were taking him to

New Orleans?

PHIL

What?

CLERK

When you came in, you said you

were driving the casket out to

New Orleans. But just now you

said you were headed for the

Joshua Tree...

PHIL

Joshua Tree, yeah.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Joshua Tree, Louisiana. Just

outside the city.

CLERK

Never heard of that.

36.

PHIL

It's small. Just another local

community struggling to get by.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Use your phone?

CLERK

(into casket)

Hello there. We was looking for

you.

CLERK (CONT'D)

Need you to sign for it again.

CLERK (CONT'D)

Looks like it's your lucky day

after all.

PHIL

Yeah.   I'm a real lucky guy.

37.

COP

I don't like the look of you.

LARRY

(miserably)

No. Fair enough.

COP

Wherever there's a hippie there's

a crime, even if it hasn't

happened yet. That's what I

always say.

LARRY

Right.   Good saying.

COP

So whatcha doing here?

LARRY

We're meeting someone off a

flight.

COP

You're meeting someone off a

flight?

LARRY

Yes.

COP

In a hearse?

LARRY

Yes.   It's a... surprise.

COP

Which parts the surprise: The

fact that you're in a bright

yellow hearse, the fact that

you're dressed like something out

of a horror film, or the fact

that you're half a mile from the

terminal and they're gonna have

to walk across two runways to

reach you?

38.

LARRY

Well... the first part.

COP

The first part.

COP (CONT'D)

Okay, now why don't you tell me

what the hell's going on?

LARRY

Going on?

PHIL

Well, I don't care if it is first

thing in the morning - but I sure

need a coffee. I tell you, I've

never seen so many darned bits of

paper to sign! It's paperwork

which is slowing this great

country down. We're drowning in

triplicate!

PHIL (CONT'D)

Good morning officer.

COP

Mornin'.

PHIL

I was just saying how people with

work to do - people like

yourself, officer - are just

getting engulfed by paper. Grab

the end, will you? Doesn't that

just drive you plain crazy?

39.

COP

I guess it does.

PHIL

One casket, six sheets to sign.

Six! That can't be right. Does

that sound right to you?

COP

Nope.   Sure don't.

PHIL

And the very last thing I want to

do is to hold you up further with

my chatter. Thank you for your

help, officer. You have a good

day, now.

COP

Just a moment, boys.

PHIL

Yessir?

COP

Your sidekick here has just

finished telling me that you're

gonna pick someone up from the

terminal. A surprise, he said.

And here you are loading a coffin

into your vehicle...

PHIL

And there you have it, officer.

You see the gentleman we're

meeting from the plane doesn't

yet know about the sad passing of

his... aunt.

COP

And you're gonna meet him off his

flight with her coffin?

40.

COP (CONT'D)

That's a real nice touch.

PHIL

Yeah. We're doing it this way

for the avoidance of doubt.

LARRY

Ignition's a bit temperamental.

COP

Right.

LARRY

Have to use a screwdriver.

COP

I see that.

PHIL

Thanks for everything, officer.

We'd best be off...

PHIL

Yes!    We did it!!

LARRY

Did what?    What did we do?

PHIL

What was all that babbling about

earlier?

LARRY

I didn't babble. I just... have

a problem with authority.

41.

PHIL

What the hell does that mean?

LARRY

I don't like them and I don't

know what to say to them. They

make me feel uneasy.

PHIL

Well of course they make you feel

uneasy. They're supposed to make

you feel uneasy.

PHIL

You hit the wall.

LARRY

I clipped it. I clipped the

wall.

PHIL

(shouts)

There's a gap fifty yards wide!

You just had to aim for the gap.

How could you miss the gap?

LARRY

(babbles)

I was distracted. We're supposed

to be picking someone up and you

arrive with a coffin and I'd only

just woken up and...

PHIL

Hello, officer. I guess they

make these hearses wider than

they need to...

42.

COP

Are you on drugs, boy?

LARRY

Uh, not at this time, no sir.

COP

Not at this time. Okay, well

let's see. You just missed a gap

of fifty yards and hit a wall in

broad daylight. Why was that?

LARRY

Well...

PHIL

Well...

COP

Now I'm gonna...

COP (CONT'D)

Wait.

PHIL

Fantastic.     Well done.

LARRY

Oh, right.     So it's all my fault?

PHIL

You... you just drove into a

wall! Of course it's your fault.

Jesus!

PHIL (CONT'D)

Here it comes...

43.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Well?

LARRY

Well what?

PHIL

Well, what are we doing now?

LARRY

He said to wait.

PHIL

Nice going, hippie. Went right

through the gap that time.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Well, we got it. Whoooh!!!

PHIL (CONT'D)

Jesus... What now?

LARRY

Get out.

PHIL

What are you talking about?

PHIL (CONT'D)

C'mon, we gotta keep moving.

LARRY

Get out and take your friend with

you.

PHIL

Look, I can see you're a bit...

sensitive about this whole...

casket thing.

44.

LARRY

Get out.

PHIL

(shouts)

Stop saying that!    I can't get

out.

LARRY

Why not?

PHIL

I... look, it's not right to

throw me out onto the street with

a coffin.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Thank God.

PHIL (CONT'D)

What the hell are you doing?

LARRY

I'm driving back to the mortuary.

PHIL

You can't do that.

LARRY

Talk.

PHIL

What talk?

LARRY

Who's the stiff?

CLERK

Parsons?

45.

STANLEY

Parsons.

CLERK

Long blond hair, blue eyes, mid-

twenties?

STANLEY

Well... yes.

CLERK

Was he in a Berkeley?

STANLEY

What's a Berkeley?

CLERK

A luxury casket of solid

mahogany, finished with a split-

hinged lid, eight brass plated

casket handles and an engraved

inscription plate.

BARBARA

Parsons.

OFFICIAL

Parsons.   And he's a... musician?

BARBARA

Was.   He was a musician.

OFFICIAL

I'm afraid we have no official

notification of death.

46.

OFFICIAL (CONT'D)

At this current time, the Greater

Los Angeles registrar of Births,

Marriages and Deaths does not

regard the local newspaper as an

official recorder of record.

PHIL

Can we please talk about this

later? This is not a great place

to be right now.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Oh, just a minute. Now I

understand... You think there's a

body back there.

PHIL (CONT'D)

You think there's a body in the

coffin!

PHIL (CONT'D)

I can fully understand why you'd

think that. I mean, it is a

coffin and all. But would I -

would I really - steal a real

live dead body?

STANLEY

You just gave the body away?

CLERK

Well, it's not like this is a

bank. People round here don't

generally take dead bodies

they're not entitled to.

STANLEY

Why did you give it to him?

47.

CLERK

Well, he signed for it.

STANLEY

Who signed for it?

CLERK

John Nobody.

STANLEY

And where do I find this John

Nobody?

CLERK

There.

LARRY

Empty?

PHIL

Absolutely, completely, totally.

LARRY

It looked pretty heavy, for an

empty casket.

PHIL

They are made of finest...

poplar. That's very heavy wood.

LARRY

Poplar? No way?   Mahogany, or

oak, but not...

PHIL

Look, I'm not going to argue with

you now. Poplar is very well

suited to the making of coffins.

48.

LARRY

Okay. So why have we got an

empty coffin in the back of the

car?

PHIL

I'm... selling them on to a

company in Palm Springs. Lots of

stiffs, lots of money. And then

of course, it's very

environmentally sound. And...

look, under the circumstances,

perhaps we should renegotiate the

financial arrangement between us.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Fifty-fifty? That baby's worth

two grand.

OFFICIAL

Don't forget now...

OFFICIAL (CONT'D)

Notification of death.

PHIL

So then Bobby transfers 'em into

hardboard boxes just prior to the

cremation and I drive the caskets

over to a guy I know in Palm

Springs who resells them.

49.

LARRY

As new?

PHIL

Well I'm not sure the 'one

careful owner' thing works with

coffins.

LARRY

The whole thing is completely

immoral.

PHIL

Yeah, well. I saw how outraged

you were back there, when I

mentioned money. Just think of

it as recycling.

LARRY

Look, I really need to get home.

PHIL

Why?

LARRY

I just... do.

PHIL

Well, while I acknowledge the

power of your argument, we have

to be somewhere else. So just

settle back and enjoy the ride.

PHIL (CONT'D)

What now?

LARRY

Gas now.

ATTENDANT

You an undertaker?

PHIL

Sure am.

50.

ATTENDANT

Ain't yer surposed to be in

black?

PHIL

Nope. We're special rock 'n roll

undertakers. Musical morticians.

PHIL

(O.S)

C'mon, hippie - let's roll.

PHIL

High test.

ATTENDANT

This car runs on regular.

PHIL

Who says it's for the car?

ATTENDANT

Ain't fer the car?

PHIL

Nope.

51.

LARRY

We could go back.

PHIL

Why would we want to do that?

LARRY

I wasn't expecting a long trip.

I haven't packed any spare

clothes. We could pick up some

supplies and drive out tomorrow.

PHIL

You want to go home to pick up

fresh clothes?

LARRY

Well, yes.

PHIL

And then drive back out tomorrow?

LARRY

We could do that.

PHIL

Just drive the car, okay?

LARRY

We could just...

PHIL

No.

LARRY

It would...

PHIL

No.

LARRY

I...

PHIL

No.

BARBARA

You might need to repeat that.

52.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Stolen? What the hell do you

mean, stolen? Who steals a body?

LARRY

I still don't fully understand

what you do.

PHIL

Well, I do everything.

LARRY

Everything?

PHIL

This little number is for

drinking money. By trade I'm a

Road Manager.

LARRY

Oh, one of those.   Like a well-

paid gopher.

PHIL

No, not like a well-paid gopher.

I'm responsible for movement,

maintenance and management. I'm

a confidante and a companion, a

partner and a patron, an ally,

agent and ambassador. I'm like

an executive nanny. Not a

gopher.

LARRY

An executive nanny, not a gopher.

Thanks for clearing that up.

53.

STANLEY

So where are the cops?

CLERK

I called them.

STANLEY

There's supposed to be a funeral

in New Orleans. I need to find

my boy.

CLERK

New Orleans?

CLERK (CONT'D)

The man said he's going to Joshua

Tree, Louisiana.

STANLEY

Joshua Tree?

BARBARA

Where's the son of a bitch?

SUSIE

The son of a bitch isn't here.

BARBARA

Well, he's stolen Gram.

SUSIE

Stolen Gram?

BARBARA

They had some kind of weird pact.

I think Phil's taken Gram out to

the desert.

SUSIE

Why?

54.

BARBARA

Some kind of voodoo thing with

hot wax and dolls to stick pins

in.

SUSIE

Don't be ridiculous.

BARBARA

Now that is a wise move, if you

ask me.

SUSIE

I didn't ask you.

BARBARA

You'll learn about Phil Kaufman.

If you stick around long enough.

SUSIE

And you know him?

BARBARA

I know he's a brainless,

interfering asshole, yes.

SUSIE

I don't need to listen to this

garbage.

BARBARA

That's him, isn't it?

SUSIE

Generally, it's best to answer

the phone to discover who's

calling.

55.

BARBARA

Fine.

PHIL

Hello baby, it's the love

machine. How are ya?

BARBARA

Hello Kaufman. I know what

you're up to, you thieving

bastard. I know where you're

going, and I know about your

sick, revolting plans, and I'm

coming after you. And when I

catch you...

PHIL

Hello Barbara. How nice to hear

from you again. And so soon...

PHIL (CONT'D)

Sorry Barb, gotta go.

PHIL (CONT'D)

It's been real, though.

56.

BARBARA

Sonofabitch!

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Okay, honey. Do you want to see

who Phil Kaufman really is? Do

you want to see what he's capable

of?

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Or maybe you already know I'm

right.

SUSIE

You don't know shit about him.

BARBARA

Well why don't we find out?

PHIL

So what's that about?

LARRY

Sunstroke.

PHIL

You've hardly left the car since

we met. How can you have

sunstroke?

LARRY

I'm susceptible.

57.

PHIL

You're a winner, that's what you

are. A winner...

PHIL (CONT'D)

Turn off here.

LARRY

This isn't the way to Palm

Springs.

PHIL

It is if you're a coffin

smuggler.

START TIME

LAPSE:

STANLEY

Good afternoon.

OLD WOMAN

Hello.

STANLEY

I'll take that one, please.

OLD WOMAN

Fifty cents.

58.

STANLEY

I was wondering... Have you seen

a hearse pass this way in the

last couple of hours?

OLD WOMAN

What's it look like?

STANLEY

Well... It... It's a big car. A

big yellow car. Two guys inside.

OLD WOMAN

Was one of 'em sick in them

bushes?

STANLEY

Well... I don't know.   Maybe.

OLD WOMAN

Yup.   I seen it.

LARRY

See, the Yin is the negative -

the darkside. And the Yang

represents positive - good. If

you like, the first is earth and

the second heaven.

DISSOLVE TO:

LARRY

The Yin Yang symbol is really

evocative about the whole

concept. As you travel around

the circle, white or black will

increase until the opposite color

is almost gone. But never

totally gone, right? And this

cycle then repeats for the

opposite color.

DISSOLVE TO:

59.

LARRY

What seems like Yin is often

supported by Yang, and vice

versa. Let me give you an

example: To truly know good, you

must first know evil, and without

good as a comparison, nothing can

be evil. So by allowing Yin to

flourish, you welcome Yan. By

letting go of Yin, you are

waiting for its return. Another

example is...

PHIL

It would be really nice if we

could get through a couple of

hours without crashing the car.

LARRY

I was distracted.

PHIL

Of course you were.

60.

PHIL (CONT'D)

I don't believe it. Middle of

nowhere, and... quick - stand in

front of the car!

LARRY

What now?

PHIL

Pretend we're having a

conversation.

LARRY

Okay.   What about?

PHIL

I don't know what about! Ever

since I met you, you've talked.

Yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking

minute. Religion, your

supersonic, supercharged car, the

darkside. Now you need to talk,

and you can't think of anything

to say.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Whatever your damn fool religion

is called, I think it works.

LARRY

Well... it's more a philosophy

than a religion.

PHIL

Oh, well done. Good work.

61.

MOTORCYCLE COP

Afternoon.

PHIL

Afternoon, officer.    How's it

going today?

MOTORCYCLE COP

Oh, it's going fine, thank you.

How are things with you?

PHIL

Fine, fine. We just... stopped

to take a look at...

PHIL (CONT'D)

...the fine view you folks have

got around here.

MOTORCYCLE COP

Well, it is mighty nice around

these parts. If you like desert.

MOTORCYCLE COP (CONT'D)

(to Larry)

And how are things with you

today, sir?

LARRY

Ooooh, I'm well. Really well,

actually. Thank you.

MOTORCYCLE COP

The reason I ask, is that you

appear to have driven into one of

our road signs.

62.

LARRY

Oh.

MOTORCYCLE COP

I'm surprised that you hadn't

noticed earlier, as it does

appear to be impeding your

forward progress.

PHIL

That's a great line...

MOTORCYCLE COP

Thank you.

MOTORCYCLE COP (CONT'D)

I wonder if you gentlemen can

help me?

PHIL

Anything.

MOTORCYCLE COP

I'm looking for some fellows who

stole a body back there at the

airport.

LARRY

A body?     Stole a body?

MOTORCYCLE COP

A body. Rather like the one in

the back of your car.

LARRY

That's an empty coffin, officer.

63.

MOTORCYCLE COP

I know it sounds strange. But

these guys - there are two of

them - they stole a body, loaded

it into the back of an old yellow

hearse painted with flowers, and

they're supposed to be driving

out this way.

LARRY

Hearse.   Flowers.

PHIL

I think he's onto us, Larry.

He's just having a little fun at

our expense.

MOTORCYCLE COP

In the car, please.

PHIL

God damn!

LARRY

He said a body. He said we stole

a body.

PHIL

He meant a coffin.

LARRY

He didn't say 'coffin'. He said

'body'. Tell me we haven't

stolen a real person.

64.

PHIL

Look, the place that I get the

coffins from probably haven't

filed a report yet. It'll all be

sorted out within the hour.

Trust me.

LARRY

Oh, I'm just overflowing with

trust for you, man. I feel this

overwhelming feeling of... trust

every time I look at you.

LARRY (CONT'D)

I'm gonna check inside that box

just as soon as we're out of

here.

PHIL

Jesus!

LARRY

What are we going to do?

PHIL

Time.

LARRY

What?

PHIL

(bitterly)

We're going to be arrested,

that's what we're going to do.

Then we'll go to court and then

we'll go to jail and we'll do

that for a while.

LARRY

What about if I could slip out of

these cuffs?

65.

PHIL

Yeah, that would be great. Then

we could suspend you from a

bridge in a straitjacket and set

the rope on fire.

LARRY

No, really. I really can slip

these cuffs.

PHIL

Okay.   Show me.

LARRY

Do you think we should go?

PHIL

Yes, I think we should go.

LARRY

Oh shit.

PHIL

Nicely done.

PHIL (CONT'D)

We'll be moving on, now that your

sign no longer appears to be

impeding our forward progress.

PHIL

What the hell are you doing?

66.

LARRY

The steering lock is on.

PHIL

Well...   turn it off!

LARRY

I can't - he's got the keys.

PHIL

So, we've escaped but we can only

drive in a circle?

LARRY

Yes.

PHIL

Can we please go?

LARRY

Okay.

SUSIE

If you hate Phil so much, why are

you chasing him across

California?

BARBARA

He's got Gram and I need him.

67.

SUSIE

Well, that's really touching.

But... you've got to come to

terms with the fact that he's

dead.

BARBARA

I know he's dead, Honey. But he

hasn't been officially

identified, and there's no

certificate of death.

SUSIE

I don't understand.

BARBARA

Let's just say I'm overly

sentimental, okay?

SUSIE

This is all about money, isn't

it?

BARBARA

Isn't everything?

SUSIE

Why do you think you deserve

anything?

BARBARA

I was a great support to Gram

before Kaufman came along and

spoiled the party.

SUSIE

Phil's not responsible for your

problems with Gram.

BARBARA

What do you know?

SUSIE

I know that he can be a pain in

the ass, but when it came to

Gram, Phil only ever did the

right thing.

BARBARA

In his whole life, Phil Kaufman

didn't do anything because it was

the right thing to do. You can

bet the ranch that wherever he

is, he's having some fun.

68.

SUSIE

Maybe that's what I like about

him.

BARBARA

Sure it is, honey. That's why

your bags were packed.

SUSIE

Have you any idea what it's like

to really love someone?

BARBARA

You might exclusively love Phil

Kaufman - but unfortunately, so

does he. You're just handy to

have around.

SUSIE

I don't have to listen to this.

SUSIE (CONT'D)

Okay, you vindictive bitch. I'm

going with you to Joshua Tree

because my life seems to have

been turned upside down and I

want to know why. But you don't

know me and I won't let you judge

me. Do it again and I'll smash

that pretty little face of yours

off the fucking road. Got it?

BARBARA

The truth can hurt, can't it?

LARRY

Well, that's it! They're going

to lock me up and throw away the

key.

PHIL

Why would they do that?

69.

LARRY

You saw what happened. I drove

over that cop's bike. That's

destruction of police property,

or something.

PHIL

You worry too much.

LARRY

Not 'til I met you...

PHIL

Jesus - what the hell is that?

LARRY

It's a dinosaur.

PHIL

Very perceptive.   What's it

doing?

LARRY

(reads)

'The Polyonax Place'.

(aside: to Phil)

A Polyonax is probably some kind

of dinosaur.

LARRY (CONT'D)

(reads)

'Dinoburgers, Reptile Steaks and

Primeval Soup. Titanosaurion

portions, prehistoric pricing.

Liquor served'.

PHIL

Pull over - let's... eat.

LARRY

Let's not. The cops'll be after

us and we should just get on to

Palm Springs and do the thing,

and then I can get home and you

can... do whatever it is you do.

Let's do that.

70.

PHIL

We need to stop. I'm starting to

get hungry. I'm not nice hungry.

LARRY

You surprise me.    I vote we keep

going.

PHIL

What gave you the impression this

was a democracy?

PHIL

You frighten him.

LARRY

I do not.

PHIL

Everyone else, he announces the

food when he brings it.

Diplodocus this and Allosaurus

that. Us he just slaps it down

and runs for cover.

71.

PHIL (CONT'D)

It's probably the rabbit food.

LARRY

Look, I'm a vegetarian. I have a

problem with dead flesh. Okay?

PHIL

I understand. Really I do. That

stuff'll mess you right up every

time.

LARRY

I thought you were hungry.

PHIL

Gotta make a call.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Hey man, where's the phone?

BARMAN

Out back.

STANLEY

Good afternoon.

BARMAN

Yup.

STANLEY

Do you have a telephone I might

use?

BARMAN

In a minute, I do.

72.

STANLEY

In a minute?

BARMAN

Yeah.    Phone's for customers.

STANLEY

I'd better order, then.

BARMAN

Right.

LARRY

Speak to her?

PHIL

Who?

LARRY

Your girlfriend?      Your wife?

PHIL

None of your damn business.

LARRY

So you didn't?

PHIL

No.

73.

LARRY

Maybe she's out.      Shopping, or

something.

PHIL

Yeah, that'll be it.     Shopping.

STANLEY

(to barman)

Beer.

STANLEY (CONT'D)

Would you put a scotch in there,

please?

BARMAN

Sure.

BARMAN (CONT'D)

Bad day?

STANLEY

Yeaaaaah.    Yeah, a real bad day.

BARMAN

What happened?

STANLEY

My boy died out here the other

day, and some punks have stolen

his body.

BARMAN

That's worth a shot on the house.

STANLEY

Thanks.

74.

PHIL

(to Larry)

We gotta go.

LARRY

Haven't finished my drink.

BARMAN

(to Stanley)

Why would someone steal a body?

PHIL

All gone.     C'mon.

STANLEY

Well, maybe they were souvenir

hunters or something. My boy's

kinda famous...

BARMAN

Who is he?

STANLEY

Gram Parsons.

BARMAN

Gram Parsons?

LARRY

Gram Parsons?

75.

LARRY

Gram Parsons? Is Gram Parsons

dead?

PHIL

Better get going.

LARRY

He said someone took Gram

Parson's body. Two people...

PHIL

Yeah, he was a real blabbermouth.

In fact, I thought he was never

gonna stop talking. Anyway,

although that's real interesting,

we've gotta keep to the schedule.

LARRY

Schedule? What schedule?   There

is no schedule...

PHIL

Well, I think we should just make

our delivery as soon as possible,

don't you? Get our package to

Palm Springs. Remember?

LARRY

Package?   We've stolen that man's

son.

PHIL

Stolen... his son? That's

outrageous! I'm appalled that

you could even think we'd do such

a thing.

LARRY

I don't know what you take me

for. I want to see in that box.

PHIL

We've really got to go.

LARRY

It's heavy.

76.

PHIL

Okay, then. Well, if you're

satisfied, let's go.

LARRY

I said it's heavy.

PHIL

Heavy, yes. Well, it is made of

wood. Wood is heavy. Actually.

LARRY

Yeah, I remember.    Finest poplar.

LARRY (CONT'D)

Jesusjesusjesus...

PHIL

Gosh, they must have given us a

full one. We'll have to sort

that all out when we get to Palm

Springs and...

LARRY

Oh my God.     You stole Gram

Parsons.

PHIL

Well, technically, we stole Gram

Parsons.

LARRY

I stole a coffin, I didn't know

there was a body in it.

PHIL

I'd save that line for court.

PHIL (CONT'D)

What are you doing now?

77.

LARRY

I don't know! What am I doing?

I mean... What-am-I-doing? Why

am I here? Why am I with you?

WHAT IS GOING ON?

PHIL

Calm down.

LARRY

I thought it was bad enough when

I ran over the cop's bike, but

now I'm a fucking body snatcher.

PHIL

Well, when you've quite finished,

we should go.

LARRY

Go? You go. I tell you what I'm

going to do. I'm going inside

and I'm going to give that man

his son back. I'm going to do

the right thing, I'm going to

follow my conscience, I'm going

to...

PHIL

Shit!

STANLEY

Son of a bitch!

78.

SUSIE

You're not a very nice person,

are you?

BARBARA

Nice? No, I suppose not.    Does

it matter?

SUSIE

It might get you further.

BARBARA

I do okay. Listen, I was an

orphan at fourteen and a waitress

at fifteen. I do what I do

because it puts food on my table,

and because if I don't look after

myself, no-one else will.

SUSIE

So what do you want from us?

BARBARA

I don't want anything from you.

It would be a bonus to see

Kaufman crash and burn, but I

don't need to be there when it

happens.

SUSIE

Why do you hate Phil so much?

BARBARA

Gram was the first good guy I

ever hooked up with. He wasn't

perfect, but it worked between

us. We just seemed to fit

together. But Gram was already

wild, and I made him wilder.

Kaufman watched over him like a

hawk, and when he felt things

were getting out of control, he

turned Gram against me. I lost

the only decent thing in my life.

SUSIE

Surely Phil was just looking

after Gram?

79.

BARBARA

Gram was an adult.   He didn't

need a nursemaid.

SUSIE

Except that now he's dead.

BARBARA

Yeah. Without my help and while

Kaufman was babysitting.

SUSIE

I don't like you much, Barbara.

BARBARA

That's fine. I just want what's

mine and then I'm gone. Gone

real fast.

PHIL

Welcome back, hippie.

LARRY

So why d'ya do it?

PHIL

Do what?

LARRY

Have a guess.

PHIL

Well, I gave my word.   This is

what Gram wanted.

LARRY

What, cruise around the desert

until he starts to smell? Were

you - both bombed?

80.

PHIL

Do you have friends?

LARRY

Of course I have friends.

PHIL

Well, what would you do for them?

LARRY

Anything, within reason.

PHIL

That's what I hate about people

like you. Everything's 'within

reason'. There are always

boundaries, provisos. You only

operate with a safety net.

LARRY

Tell me something - if it was the

other way round, would Gram be

sitting here, driving your bones

out into the desert?

LARRY (CONT'D)

Well?

PHIL

You've missed the point. See, it

doesn't matter what he would do,

or what you and your tie-dyed

friends think is the correct way

to behave. To me, it only

matters what I do. Where you

have boundaries and limits and

thresholds - I only have right

and wrong. If I make a promise,

I keep it - that's right. If I

break that promise - that's

wrong.

81.

LARRY

Ohmygod.

LARRY (CONT'D)

You made me do it, you bastard!

I've never hit anyone in my life,

but you pushed and you pushed

and... you gave me no choice.

LARRY

Shit.

LARRY (CONT'D)

Shit.   Shitshitshit.

82.

STANLEY

Yeah?

LARRY

Hi.

STANLEY

Hello.

LARRY

Um. I'm one of the guys that

took your son.

STANLEY

You'd better come in.

BARBARA

Where's the catch on this piece

of shit?

SUSIE

Phil?    Phil!

83.

SUSIE

What happened to your head?

PHIL

A hippie hit it.   I thought you'd

gone.

SUSIE

Hold that thought.

PHIL

What the hell does that mean?

SUSIE

I need to know what it is you're

doing.

BARBARA

I told you what he's doing! He's

going to set fire to my Gram in

some freaky ceremony with witches

and black magic and... dolls.

PHIL

Dolls?

SUSIE

Dolls to stick pins in.

PHIL

What the hell are you talking

about?

BARBARA

(shouts)

I want my man back!

PHIL

Enough of this shit.

84.

PHIL (CONT'D)

They've gotta be in here.    It's

fate.

PHIL

Whatever happened to peace, love

and understanding, hippie?

STANLEY

You're Kaufman?

PHIL

Yup.

STANLEY

And you are?

SUSIE

I'm with him.

BARBARA

Hello Stanley. Remember me?     The

psychotic girlfriend?

STANLEY

Hello Barbara. Nothing wrong

with your memory.

STANLEY (CONT'D)

Did you sell tickets or

something? Now, you boys want to

tell me why you stole my son?

LARRY

Well, I didn't even know he was

in the box.

85.

PHIL

I'm going to cremate him, here in

the desert where he felt most at

home. That's what he wanted.

BARBARA

The hell you are, Kaufman.

STANLEY

You know I can't let you do that?

PHIL

I know you have to.

STANLEY

I don't have to do anything,

Mister Kaufman. This is MY loss!

This was MY son! How dare you

try to take my grief away from

me.

PHIL

It's too late to claim him now.

STANLEY

What the hell does that mean?

PHIL

It means that you were never

there when it mattered to Gram.

It means that you stopped being a

father the moment he stopped

doing your bidding. It means

that you learned to care too

late. That's what it means.

STANLEY

I don't have to justify my

relationship with Gram to you.

PHIL

Not to me, no.

STANLEY

It's true that when Gram left

college, we drifted apart.

(MOR E)

86.

STA NLEY (CONT'D)

He was a disappointment to me,

because he wouldn't use his

brain. He had so much to offer,

but he let it trickle away.

PHIL

No - he gave it his all, but in a

way you could never understand.

And all he ever wanted from you

was approval. He wanted you to

be proud of what he had achieved.

STANLEY

I kept everything. Every record,

every article, every photo.

PHIL

It's no good telling me.   You

should have told him.

STANLEY

I loved him.

PHIL

Too late...

STANLEY

I understand that you were his

right-hand man, as well as his

friend?

PHIL

I was both, yes.

STANLEY

And that you weren't there when

he died? When he needed you

most?

PHIL

Yes.    That's right.

STANLEY

So the guilt isn't all mine,

then?

PHIL

I guess not.

87.

STANLEY

You boys took away my son. I

lost him once in life, and now

you're trying to take him from me

again.

BARBARA

Can we just cut through this?

BARBARA (CONT'D)

You two stole the body. Theft.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Sweetie, I'm sorry, but you seem

to be in the whole thing up to

your neck. Accessory.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

And you are an old fool who

should have called the police,

but hasn't. Stupidity.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Now, let's just call the cops and

get it done. The sooner we get

us a death certificate and bury

him, the sooner his soul will be

properly laid to rest.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Hey! What the hell are you

doing?

STANLEY

Son, you had your chance to look

after Gram, and now he's dead.

88.

BARBARA

(O.S)

Bastard!

PHIL

I only failed because I couldn't

save him from himself. You

failed him all his life. You

never believed. I never doubted.

STANLEY

Okay. You tell me why I should

let you take my boy.

PHIL

I was his road manager and his

friend. We loved it out here in

the desert, and we made a pact

that whoever died first, the

other would come down here and

set them free. Gram gave his

word and I gave mine.

STANLEY

You're a couple of druggies.   Why

should I believe you?

PHIL

I don't take drugs.

STANLEY

What about you? Are you a

druggie?

LARRY

Yes.    Yes I am.

89.

PHIL

(to Larry)

Nice work. Let's go.

LARRY

I can't do this.      This isn't

right.

SUSIE

Just do whatever feels right to

you.

PHIL

God damn!

PHIL

Did you call them?

STANLEY

No.

PHIL

Are you going to call them?

STANLEY

Well, you haven't given me a

reason not to.

PHIL

There isn't a reason. If someone

tried to steal my son's body, I'd

stop them. For sure.

STANLEY

So you are prepared to go to

jail?

PHIL

I'm expecting to.

90.

BARBARA

(O.S)

Don't you worry - it's gonna

happen!

LARRY

Mister Parsons?

STANLEY

What is it, son?

LARRY

I've been a junkie for over four

years. I started taking heroin

on June 5th 1969 at a concert in

Indiana. I...

STANLEY

You don't need...

LARRY

I've taken heroin, speed, uppers,

downers, blues, morphine,

methadone, mushrooms, quaaludes,

acid, valium, barbiturates,

straight LSD, marijuana,

marijuana laced with opium,

nembutal, mescalin of course, and

medical methaqualone, which made

me shake uncontrollably for six

weeks and vomit every hour.

STANLEY

(dryly)

That's very impressive, son.

LARRY

Not my point.

PHIL

Better make the point.

LARRY

I started working my way through

that list on June 5th 1969, and

since then there hasn't been a

day when I didn't at least smoke

one joint.

91.

PHIL

Are we sure that this is helping?

LARRY

And now I've stopped. I stopped

because it seems that I had

something more important to do.

LARRY (CONT'D)

He's doing this because he gave

his word. I'm prepared to do

this now because I think it's

right. And because I believe

that each body has a soul. And

Gram's soul doesn't belong in a

family plot surrounded by

strangers. It belongs here,

where he was happiest.

STANLEY

I'm going to go say goodbye to my

son.

PHIL

What's that for?

SUSIE

That's for failing to reinforce

my expectations.

PHIL

Well... I'll have to do that more

often.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Did you really take all those

drugs?

LARRY

Of course not.

92.

LARRY (CONT'D)

I may have got a little carried

away...

PHIL

C'mon, time to go...

PHIL

Just checking.

LARRY

Yeah, he took the body and

stuffed it in the trunk of his

car before escaping into the

night.

PHIL

Are you coming?

SUSIE

I reckon I am.

BARBARA

Thank God!

93.

TRAFFIC COP

Evenin' ma'am.

BARBARA

Please help me, they've got my

boyfriend's corpse and they're

going to perform a ritual with

his body.

TRAFFIC COP

May I see your driving license

please, ma'am?

BARBARA

My driving license?

TRAFFIC COP

Please.

BARBARA

I've just told you that they've

stolen a body and you want to see

my driving license?

BARBARA (CONT'D)

You people are supposed to be on

the lookout for a hearse. A

hearse is a big long car. You

can usually tell which ones are

the hearses, because they have

coffins in the back. The one

we're looking for is painted

yellow. Does this look like a

yellow hearse to you, asshole?

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Is that a ticket? Are you

writing me a ticket?

TRAFFIC COP

Yes it is, ma'am. And yes I am.

94.

PHIL

Cap Rock. This is perfect.

Really peaceful...

PHIL

You wanna give me a hand here?

PHIL (CONT'D)

Sorry, Gram.

LARRY

What now?

PHIL

Now we... do it.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Take the top off.

LARRY

Why?

PHIL

Flesh burns easier than wood.

LARRY

I can't believe you just said

that. I'm not taking the top

off.

95.

PHIL

(to Gram)

Hey, man. Looking a little

peaky...

SUSIE

Some decorum would be nice.

PHIL

Right.

PHIL (CONT'D)

Do you think that's enough?

LARRY

Well, I don't know.   Maybe a

little more.

PHIL

Enough?

SUSIE

I'm not having a conversation

with you about how much gasoline

you need to burn a body.

LARRY

I think that'll do it.

PHIL

Only a little left.

PHIL (CONT'D)

I'm sorry I wasn't there for you

when it mattered, but I was there

before, and I've been there ever

since. Gram, good luck to you,

wherever you are.

96.

PHIL (CONT'D)

That's my last one, man.

TRAFFIC COP

Jesus!    What the hell's that?

BARBARA

That'll be Gram Parsons, on fire.

TRAFFIC COP

Get in the car, ma'am.   Now.

LARRY

Maybe too much fuel.

PHIL

Nah, I just didn't factor in the

booze inside of him. Gram

always...

PHIL (CONT'D)

I think our work here is done.

PHIL

Go!

97.

TRAFFIC COP

How do you know it's your

boyfriend?

BARBARA

(sarcastically)

I recognize that birthmark on his

shoulder. Look, can I make an

observation?

TRAFFIC COP

Be my guest.

BARBARA

We're in the desert. It is dark.

If you want to catch someone in

the dark, it's best not to turn

on big flashing lights and make a

loud noise with a siren.

TRAFFIC COP

Do you want to know what I think,

ma'am?

BARBARA

No. But I'm really, really keen

to find out.

TRAFFIC COP

I think it was suicide. He just

wanted to get away from you.

98.

GRAM

Sure is hot.

PHIL

Hello, Gram.

GRAM

Phil.

PHIL

Do you think you should?

GRAM

Not gonna hurt me now, is it?

GRAM (CONT'D)

Nice wheels. Very stylish.

PHIL

They're very handy for

transporting dead people around.

Nothing better.

GRAM

I am dead, then?

PHIL

You're more than dead, Gram. You

and the box are down to bones and

brass.

GRAM

Oh, well.    Here's mud in your

eye.

PHIL

What can I do for you, Gram?

GRAM

You assume I want something.

PHIL

Well, you're here. And seeing as

I just burned you to a cinder,

you shouldn't be.

(MOR E)

99.

PHI L (CONT'D)

So I'm guessing you've got some

kind of reason.

GRAM

Well, okay. I just wanted to say

thanks.

PHIL

What for?

GRAM

Doing the thing that we agreed,

keeping your word, keeping them

all away...

PHIL

Well, that's okay, Gram.    But I

don't need thanking.

GRAM

You don't?

PHIL

I'm just taking care of business.

That's what you paid me for -

that's what I do.

GRAM

You shooting for a raise?

PHIL

Actually, I just quit.

GRAM

Well, I s'pose I should be

getting along.

PHIL

Goodbye, Gram. I'm glad it all

worked out.

GRAM

What?

PHIL

I said I'm glad it all worked

out.

LARRY

All what worked out?

100.

PHIL

Doesn't matter. Can we go now?

I'm getting sick of sand.

LARRY

Well, we did it.    We saved a

soul.

PHIL

Singed my damn mustache, that's

for sure.

LARRY

Well, shall we?

PHIL

Yeah.    Let's roll, hippie.

PHIL

Where d'you think you might be

when I'm done?

101.

SUSIE

I'll be waiting.

PHIL

Yeah, but where?

SUSIE

Get out of here.   Finish it.
