REVISED SECOND DRAFT

February 27, 2003

SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL

Where are you going, Jelly Bean?

CUT TO:

2.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

3.

PARKER (O.S.)

Morning.

PARKER

Why the young executive look?

DREW

I have my interview at NYU today.

DREW

No way Mom knows about that.

PARKER

And she never will. At least

until after I'm married.

DREW

Didn't it hurt?

PARKER

Like hell.

DREW

Piercings are so... unhygienic.

(CONTINUED)

4.

DREW

Breakfast.

PARKER

(suddenly wide-awake)

Hellooo, Warren.

(CONTINUED)

5.

DREW

Morning, Dad.

CHARLEY

Morning, baby.

DREW

How's the book coming?

CHARLEY

(sigh)

Well, sweety, my writing process

is a lot like a giant

hydroelectric dam. For a long

time I just let the great ideas

build up and build up until the

sheer weight of them spills over

and the words just come pouring

out.

DREW

Still stuck, huh?

CHARLEY

Not a word.

DREW

Another one for the trophy room,

huh?

(CONTINUED)

6.

PARKER

Boys can be fun. You should try

one some time.

QUINN

(to Drew)

You ready for your interview?

DREW

(funny you

should ask)

I've prepared a color-coded

itinerary based on dividing the

day into fifteen minute increments

alternating blue/red, double-

checked the train schedule,

confirmed with the Weather Channel

and rehearsed a couple of

alternate scenarios last night,

you know, just to account for all

the possible glitches.

PARKER

We'll take that as a yes.

CHARLEY

I'm proud of you for sticking to

your plan all these years, sweety.

PARKER

I still don't understand why you

want to finish college in two

years? What's the big hurry?

DREW

I want to hit the ground running.

All those football games and the

partying and the whole dating

scene. It just seems like a lot

of wasted time that could be spent

more productively.

QUINN

The Accelerated program would look

great on your med school

application.

PARKER

Football games I get. But

partying? A waste of time?

(CONTINUED)

7.

CHARLEY

To each her own.

QUINN

Well, Drew.   I have a surprise.

QUINN

I took the day off.

(excitedly)

I'm going into the City with you.

DREW

(panicked)

What -- ?!

QUINN

Isn't that great! We can do some

shopping, have lunch, real girl

stuff. Won't that be fun?

PARKER

If you want to have fun, I'm the

one who should go, not Mother

Teresa over there.

PARKER

Let me know if you want me to do

the Heimlich. It'd be cool to

have you owe me your life.

QUINN

You okay?

DREW

(still clearing)

No... I mean, it's... impossible.

I've got every minute accounted

for right up to the interview.

Blue and red! It won't work.

QUINN

I just thought... you know... I've

been working and we haven't had a

chance to spend much time

together...

(CONTINUED)

8.

QUINN

... and both my babies are going

away to college next Fall.

PARKER

Don't be sad, Mom. Just think,

when Drew leaves for school, you

won't be losing a daughter, you'll

be losing an anal-retentive social

misfit who will be voted most

likely to die a virgin.

DREW

I'm sorry, Mom. It's really sweet

of you. But don't worry. Parker

will be living here with you

forever since no college on earth

will ever take her.

QUINN

Stop it, you two.

PARKER

It's not fair you guys get to go

into the City and I don't.

CHARLEY

Don't you have a chem test, young

lady?

PARKER

Chemistry? Please. Name one time

you ever used chemistry in your

life.

CHARLEY

(beat)

Good point.

QUINN

(adamant)

I use chemistry every day.

(CONTINUED)

9.

PARKER

You're a    doctor, Mom. I'm not

going to    be a doctor. I can't

even say    the word 'orifice,' let

alone put    a finger up one.

DREW

(worried)

Time to go.

QUINN (O.S.)

Come on, honey! Let's tear up

Manhattan!

DREW

You're smart. You're resourceful.

You'll find a way to make it work.

10.

QUINN

(to phone)

Doctor MacLeod...

(beat; winking

at Drew)

I'm sorry, but my itinerary is

booked solid today. Call Dr.

Wessels. He's covering for me.

(beat)

He did?

(beat)

Are you sure it's the baby's head?

(beat)

All right. I'm coming.

QUINN

I'm sorry, hon. It's a Blue Light

special in Maternity. Every bed's

full and some poor woman is about

to give birth in the gift shop. I

have to go in.

DREW

Ah, darn it, Mom. That's a shame.

It's like fate is conspiring

against us.

QUINN

I know.

DREW

You absolutely, positively have to

promise me we'll do it another

time.

QUINN

I promise. I better hurry. Have

Parker drop you at the train

station on her way to school, will

you?

(CONTINUED)

11.

QUINN

Kill 'em in that interview.

DREW

(beat)

Mom, you know, I might not get in.

QUINN

Are you kidding me? You're Drew

MacLeod. Nobody's smarter, nobody

works harder and nobody, and I

mean nobody, is ever more

prepared.

DREW

Hey!   Stop!

DREW

PARKER!!

PARKER

Good luck with your interview.

DREW

You know, Parker. Chemistry is

important. When you think about

it, everything's made of

chemicals.

(CONTINUED)

12.

PARKER

Oh, I'm interested in chemistry.

Just not the kind with all the

numbers and stinky test tubes.

PARKER

Ah, chemistry.

DREW

(low; rehearsing)

Professor Spaulding. Good

afternoon. I'm Drew MacLeod.

DREW

What do you think you're doing?

PARKER

(too loud; with

headphones on)

Looking for a seat.

(CONTINUED)

13.

DREW

This can't be happening. Wait, I

know. This is one of those Ground

Hog Day dreams, isn't it?

DREW

Ow!

(to Parker)

I'm awake now. You're supposed to

disappear.

PARKER

(still too loud)

You know, I just got this itch.

DREW

Then scratch it and get back to

school.

PARKER

I couldn't concentrate anyway.

I'm too... distracted today.

DREW

You're permanently distracted.

It's called Attention Deficit

Disorder.

(spotting her

Blackberry)

Is this about that chat room guy?

It is, isn't it?

PARKER

No! It's about spontaneity, which

you obviously wouldn't know

anything about.

DREW

I swear to God, Parker, you go

through boyfriends like Junior

Mints. It's pathetic.

PARKER

Pathetic? You want to talk about

pathetic?! At least I don't count

getting accidentally felt up in

dodge ball as my first date!

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

14.

PARKER (CONT'D)

You're going to be eighteen and

you've never even HAD a boyfriend!

DREW

Is this any of your business?

DREW

This is ridiculous. I don't    have

time for this today. Fine.      Don't

graduate from high school.     Make a

mess of your life over some

complete stranger. I don't     care.

But leave me out. I have

something important I need    to

accomplish today, so please    go

away.

EXECUTIVE

(to Parker)

Would you like this seat so you

two can fight?

DREW/PARKER

No thank you.

DREW

I have to mentally preview my day

now. I can't talk anymore.

PARKER

Uh, Drew? Do you have any money?

I don't have enough for a ticket.

PARKER

Please.   Like you never ditched

school.

CUT TO:

15.

PARKER

'You don't know how you met me...'

PARKER

Excuse me.

CONDUCTOR

Ticket, please.

PARKER

Why don't I save the b.s. story

and just ask you to cut me a break

this one time because I know

you've got a big heart and you

remember what it was like when you

were young and... and...

(off the Conductor's

look)

... randy?

PARKER

(calling after)

I guess you were never young and

randy!

16.

CONDUCTOR

Very funny.

DREW

Excuse me?

CONDUCTOR

Let's go.

DREW

What are you doing?

CONDUCTOR

I tried to be nice about it, but

if you want the police involved,

this is the way to do it.

DREW

Police?     I didn't do anything.

CONDUCTOR

No ticket, no train ride.

DREW

(realizing)

No! That's not me! That was my

twin sister you threw off!

CONDUCTOR

Young lady, in thirty years I have

heard every possible line but

that's the lamest ever.

DREW

(pointing)

She's right there!

(CONTINUED)

17.

DREAM GUY

You okay?

DREW

I'm... ouch.

CONDUCTOR

She's fine, considering she should

be in jail.

DREW

This   can't be happening! I have

a...   a... little paper thingy.

What   are they called? Ticket! I

have   a ticket! It's right...

DREW

(to the gods)

AARRGGH! PARRR... KERRR!

PARKER

You get kicked off, too? Why

didn't you just buy a ticket?

(CONTINUED)

18.

DREW

Don't.

PARKER

What happened to your head?

DREW

Oh, just a minor concussion I

sustained while the Conductor was

throwing me off the train because

he thought I was you sneaking back

on the train!

PARKER

Sorry.

DREW

I'll bet.

PARKER

(calling after)

I am!    Where are you going?

DREW

To see when the next train

leaves.

PARKER

I already --

PARKER

-- did. They said something about

a delay.

19.

EXECUTIVE #2

That's me.

DREW

That can't be.  I have to be there

before two!

TRAIN CLERK

Well, maybe if you flap your arms

real fast you can fly there,

because you won't get there on a

train.

DREW

(about to explode)

What did you just say?

(CONTINUED)

20.

PARKER

Come on.   Hurry. I got us a ride.

DREW

Let go of my arm.

DREW

What's this?

PARKER

A car service.

DREW

Car service? You couldn't have

called for a...

BENNIE

Morning, miss.

PARKER

Good morning. Thank you.   My

sister's coming, too.

PARKER

You want to make that interview,

or not?

(CONTINUED)

21.

BENNIE

So you're headed to the Teamster's

Hall on Second Street?

PARKER

(chewing a lip)

You know, Mister...

PARKER

... Loyola.

BENNIE

Bennie.

PARKER

Mr. Bennie? We have a slight

change of itinerary. We need to

go into Manhattan. 57th and 5th

will be fine.

BENNIE

It's pre-paid.     No skin off my

nose.

DREW

(whispering

throughout)

Pre-paid? What's 57th and 5th?

PARKER

(whispering

throughout)

Barneys.

DREW

Not Barneys.

PARKER

We've got five hours.     Relax.

DREW

This was supposed to be someone

else's car, wasn't it?

(CONTINUED)

22.

PARKER

So?

DREW

'Scarpelli'?   We're supposed to be

Italian?

PARKER

Northern Italian.

DREW

This is so... wrong.

PARKER

What? You need to get to that

interview. We now have a ride.

We will pay for the ride. End of

big deal.

BENNIE

Yeah?

(beat)

No.  The city.

(beat)

What'a you talkin' about?

BENNIE

I already got 'em.

BENNIE

They're right here in the car.

(to girls)

'Scuse me.

(CONTINUED)

23.

PARKER

(low to Drew)

Not good.

DREW

(swallowing)

What's happening?

BENNIE

(to phone)

Don't you think that's a little

severe? I mean, they didn't see

nothin' yet. They can't hear

nothin'.

BENNIE

You're the boss.

(beat)

Take it easy. I'll fix it.

(beat)

No, I don't have a shovel. Not

today. It'll be a big mess.

Besides, I just had this suit

cleaned.

BENNIE

I'll take 'em to the wharf, what

difference does it make?

DREW

(whispered terror)

Parker, I think maybe we should

get out.

PARKER

I agree.   How about... NOW!

BENNIE (O.S.)

Hey?!   Where you goin'?!

24.

PARKER

He's stuck at the light!

DREW

He has no respect for traffic

laws!

DREW

Is he gone? I can't believe this.

What did you get us into?

PARKER

We lost him.    Wow. That was a

rush.

DREW

A rush?   Are you out of your mind?

BUM (O.S.)

Hey.   Give me a quarter, will ya?

(CONTINUED)

25.

MINI-MART CLERK

Get outta here, Uncle Jerry!

PARKER

(to Homeless Guy)

I don't have any change, but here.

DREW

Parker, you're only feeding the

poor man's disease. Buy him a

healthy snack.

HOMELESS GUY

I gotta go.

PARKER

Ew. That stinks. That's not just

Slushee.

MINI-MART CLERK

It's Mad Dog. Look at that mess.

It's gonna smell up the store all

day.

PARKER

May we use your bathroom please?

MINI-MART CLERK

Gas station at the end of the

block. Have a nice day.

26.

BURT

You know, it's not my place to

say, but you young girls got your

whole lives ahead of you. You

shouldn't be drinkin' at this hour

of the day.

PARKER

That's what I keep telling her.

BURT

'Round the side.

GIRLS

AHHHHHHH!!!!

CUT TO:

PARKER

Everything's going to be fine.

(to baby)

Peek-a-boo!

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

27.

PARKER (CONT'D)

(to Drew)

We're practically there. We'll

get you cleaned up, you'll get

into the program and...

(to baby)

Peek-a-boo!

(to Drew)

... we'll both look back on this

and laugh our butts off.

DREW

I will never, ever, forgive you.

PARKER

See?   New York. We made it.

DREW

I could be arrested for vagrancy

looking like this.

PARKER

Listen.   I've got an idea.

DREW

No. No ideas. I'm going straight

to that interview and wait,

without moving or speaking,

especially to you, for four hours.

PARKER

(ignoring her)

Come on! We're going to the

Plaza! We can be Eloise! We'll

get a nice room, you can take a

shower and I'll swap clothes with

you! Simple as that!

DREW

Do you have the slightest clue

what that would cost?

(CONTINUED)

28.

PARKER

So? You've got the emergency

credit card Mom gave you, right?

PARKER

What's wrong?

DREW

(dawning realization)

Oh.   My. God.

PARKER

Where's your, uh, stuff?

DREW

(near coma)

I left it in his car.

PARKER

Oh.

DREW

He knows where I live. He's going

to hunt me down and kill me.

PARKER

Come on, Drew. I don't think even

the Mafia kills people just for

scamming a ride. Quit being

paranoid.

(beat)

So, we don't do the Plaza. I've

got...

PARKER

Six dollars and thirty-two cents.

DREW

That won't get me hosed down at a

car wash.

PARKER

What are we thinking? You've got

your secret-safety twenty!

DREW

(beat)

My secret-safety twenty. Of

course. But it's only for

emergencies.

(CONTINUED)

29.

DREW

Yeah.

DREW

Hey, how'd you know about my

secret-safety twenty?

PARKER

That's not important now. But

let's just say that it's a good

thing for you I think those shoes

are so ugly I never borrowed them.

(pointing)

Hey, how about there?

DREW

No. I want to get clean, not

contract hepatitis.

PARKER

(sotto voce)

Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six

cents.

DREW

We touch nothing.

PARKER

(swallowing)

Hello?    Anybody?

(CONTINUED)

30.

DESK CLERK (O.S.)

Keep your pants on. What'dya

want?

DESK CLERK (O.S.)

I don't got all day.

PARKER

(uh...)

We need a room... with a shower.

Just for an hour.

DESK CLERK

Sixty bucks.

PARKER

(getting oriented)

Hi.

DESK CLERK

You want the room or not?

DREW

Sixty dollars an hour for this --

PARKER

(interrupting;

covering)

-- really nice place. How much

for half an hour.

DESK CLERK

Maybe if you two were in school

you could figure out that half a

sixty is thirty.

PARKER

We've only got twenty-five.

(CONTINUED)

31.

DESK CLERK

You think because I'm short you

can just charm me into making some

deal, is that it?

PARKER

No, not at all.

DREW

It's all we have. Twenty-six

dollars and thirty-six cents.

DESK CLERK

Are you the one that stinks so

bad?

DREW

(insulted)

I had a little accident, okay?

DESK CLERK

All right, all right, don't    get

your underwear in a bunch.     As a

public service, just 'cause    you

stink so bad, you can have    it for

twenty-five.

DESK CLERK

Ten-dollar deposit on key.

DREW

What part of 'That is all the

money we have' didn't make sense

to you?

PARKER

Sir,   that's every last cent we

have   in the world. I swear to

you,   we aren't planning to steal

your   key.

DESK CLERK

I give you some special deal, the

next thing you know, you two are

telling everybody, hey, this

midget was a real sap. We gave

him some sob story and the little

guy just busted up into crocodile

tears and handed over the key.

(CONTINUED)

32.

PARKER

I promise we won't tell anyone.

Will we, Drew?

DREW

Not a word.      Girl Scout's honor.

DREW

AHHHHHH!!!!

PARKER

Drew?!   DREW?!

DESK CLERK

Come back with my key!

PARKER

Drew!    STOP!

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

33.

QUINN

Mrs. Greenspan? You're going to

have to help. I need you to push.

MRS. GREENSPAN

Did you see that?

MR. GREENSPAN

Honey?   The baby? Please?

CUT TO:

NYPD OFFICER

All right.   Who's the wise guy?

PARKER

Man, that little guy could really

motor. Why'd you bolt?

DREW

There was a rat, Parker. A rat

the size of a Doberman eating my

foot.

PARKER

That was all our money.

DREW

Our money?   OUR MONEY?!

PARKER

Key down, you're going to have an

attack.

(CONTINUED)

34.

DREW

Parker, it was not 'our' money and

this is not 'our' day in New York.

What it is, is quite possibly the

most important day of my life.

I've resigned myself to the fact

that you don't give a crap about

what you do with yours, but if you

could find it in your heart, your

tiny, cold steel heart, to respect

what this means to me, I would

appreciate it.

DREW

You're not even listening. That's

typical. Look, we're splitting

up. Give me back my secret safety

money.

PARKER

(still looking past

Drew)

You know how I told you not to be

paranoid?

DREW

Paranoid?

PARKER

What I meant was, it isn't

paranoia if someone really is

chasing you.

DREW

What's wrong with your eyes?

PARKER

(whispering)

It's him.

(CONTINUED)

35.

PARKER

Quiet.   Don't run. He'll see us.

DREW

HE SAW US!

DREW

How'd he find us?

PARKER

Maybe it's just coincidence!

DREW

Or maybe WE TOLD HIM WHERE WE WERE

GOING!!

PARKER

Come on!

PARKER

Jump!

36.

DREW

I don't want to do this anymore.

I want to be done. No more rats,

no more mob hit men.

PARKER

Well, Cinderella, your wish has

come true.

(gesturing)

Voila, La Plaza, mademoiselle.

DREW

So?     Hello?   No dinero?

PARKER

Yeah. I've got what I'd like to

call a 'creative solution' to

that.

DREW

No.     I'm calling Mom.

PARKER

What good will that do?

DREW

(beat)

I'll have her... uh...

PARKER

Have her what? Hi, Mom? Could

you leave that baby halfway outta

there and drive into the city?

DREW

Dad, then.

PARKER

Dad, hey. Drew. Complete loser.

Couldn't get to an interview by

myself, need full bail out. Yeah.

I'm the one who was going to

change the world, I just couldn't

get across town.

(CONTINUED)

37.

DREW

Damn it, Parker, my itinerary is

shot to hell! Blue, red --

DREW

I don't even know what that means!

I'm running out of time.

(noticing)

Is that guy looking at me?

DREW

Don't look.

PARKER

When you ask a question like that,

the person is going to look.

DREW

I think he was.

PARKER

Drew, we haven't done anything.

DREW

Yeah, but I'm standing in the

lobby of the Plaza looking like a

deranged street person who might

attack at any moment. In fact, I

might attack at any moment.

PARKER

Let's go.

(CONTINUED)

38.

DREW

(whispering)

What are we doing? And why am I

whispering?

PARKER

We're getting you a shower. Blake

Greer pulled this at the Sheraton

after the prom.

DREW

Great. Now we're emulating Blake

Greer, voted most likely to commit

a felony before having to shave.

PARKER

We're not going to steal anything.

We're just going to sneak in, use

a little soap and water and get

out.

DREW

Oh, we're not going to steal

anything. Super. Just a little

'breaking and entering.'

PARKER

We're not going to break anything.

(beat)

We are going to enter, however.

DREW

No.   No.   No.

PARKER

Shhh... here comes somebody.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

It's the New York Kennel Club,

Emile, not the New York

Knickerbockers. Please call the

caterer and cancel the beer.

(CONTINUED)

39.

PARKER

Hurry up!

DREW

No!

PARKER

(beat)

I didn't want to have to do this,

but... look in the mirror behind

you.

CUT TO:

PARKER

(tentatively)

Housekeeping?

CUT TO:

DREW

I can't do this.

PARKER

Drew, you're not a criminal. You

just smell like one. This way.

(CONTINUED)

40.

DREW

Oh, no.  Oh my god. A... a...

(puzzled)

What the hell is it?

PARKER

A dog?

DREW

I'm itching already.   See?   Are my

arms red?

PARKER

Key down. I'll take him in the

living room and keep a lookout.

You just get in that shower.

PARKER

(baby talk)

Hi, little guy. You don't look so

tough, huh? You don't look much

like a dog, actually. More like

Woody Woodpecker.

PARKER

You're cute, aren't you, in a

freakazoidal kinda way.

PARKER

Was your daddy a rat? Is that it?

Well, I still like you.

41.

PARKER

Come back here, little ratdog.

Come to Mommy Parker.

PARKER

Bad ratdog!

PARKER

(breathless)

Wow.   Thank you.

ROGER

Thank you. Bye bye.

No.

PARKER

That's not your dog!      Hey!

42.

CUT TO:

HOUSE SECURITY GUY (O.S.)

Hello? Mrs. Lo Biancho? House

security!

DREW

(panicked)

There's a man in there!

PARKER

Somebody took the dog!

(CONTINUED)

43.

PARKER

Hurry up!

DREW

I'll, uh, go around.

PARKER

Are you out of your mind?!    It's

only a little ways! JUMP!

MRS. LO BIANCHO

(peeved)

When competing in a dog show, best

to bring one's dog along, yes?

MR. LO BIANCHO

I thought you had him, dear.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

(holding up her hands)

See?   Empty.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

Oh, dear God!

MRS. LO BIANCHO (O.S.)

(screeching)

AHHHH!! MY BABY! SOMEONE'S

KIDNAPPED MY BABY!

(CONTINUED)

44.

MORTY

Mrs. Lo Biancho? I'm Mort

Sestero, hotel security.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

Please!   Please help!

MORTY

Someone took your baby?

MR. LO BIANCHO

The Emperor is missing.

MORTY

(somewhat relieved)

The Emperor is a dog, right?

MRS. LO BIANCHO

Not 'a' dog, no. THE NEW YORK

KENNEL CLUB CHAMPION AND WHY

AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FIND HIM!

MORTY

(to radio)

This is Remote One to base, Remote

One to base. Code 12, I repeat,

Code 12.

ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.)

You goin' to lunch already, Morty?

MORTY

(impatient)

Code 12 isn't lunch, Bruce!

Didn't you read your manual?

ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.)

(beat)

I will.

MONTY

Call NYPD.    We have a dognapping.

ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.)

A what?

(CONTINUED)

45.

MORTY

Just call the damn police and

patch me through. The Emperor's

been kidnapped.

ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.)

Holy cripes, why didn't you say it

was political?!

MORTY

Political?     THE EMPEROR IS A DOG,

MORON!

ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.)

You want me to call NYPD about a dog?

MORTY

(decrying his fate)

I am going to kill you, then fire

you, Bruce. Got it? Kill, fire.

That order.

CUT TO:

DREW

I can't do it!

PARKER

Yes you can!

DREW

No I can't!

PARKER

Have fun in prison. Under 'Summer

Internships' on your college

application, you can write

'license plate manufacturing.'

(CONTINUED)

46.

DREW

(astonished)

I did it.

DREW (O.S.)

OW!

PARKER

Get out of there!

DREW (O.S.)

(beat)

Give me... my... curtain.

MORTY

Stop!    Bring back that dog!

DREW

He thinks we have the dog!

PARKER

A painter took it!

DREW

A pain --

(CONTINUED)

47.

DREAM GUY

You know, one of us is gonna get

hurt if we keep doing this.

PARKER

Hey, complete stranger!      Get off

my sister!

DREW

I'm, uh, late for this place,

thing, where I'm supposed to be.

College. Interview!

DREAM GUY

Where at?

DREW

NYU!

DREAM GUY

(too late)

Me, too!

48.

BOBO

(French accent)

Where are they?! No more breaks!

Do you hear me! We have a show to

do, you nitwits! Models! BAH!

You have hollow gourds for heads!

The kind they make those Mexican

rattles out of!

SHOWRUNNER

(always at his elbow)

Maracas.

BOBO

Maracas! Maracas that take coffee

breaks when I am paying them a

FORTUNE!

BOBO

Hair!  Makeup!

(Parker)

Daywear!

(Drew)

Clubbing! Vite!

BOBO

(confess)

Is that Helmut Lang?

(recovering himself)

Go!

(CONTINUED)

49.

HAIRSTYLIST

Perfection.

CUT TO:

DREW

Why does this not surprise me?

DREW

Excuse me, but I'm supposed to be

going to my college interview.

SHOWRUNNER

That's rich. A model going to

college. What next? Talking

monkeys?

(CONTINUED)

50.

PARKER

(whispering)

The hotel guy's here.

PARKER

(louder)

And the police.

(CONTINUED)

51.

DREW

Everybody washed their hands,

right?

HOGAN

I guess that explains why he's a

security guard.

DREW

(realizing)

Perfect.

PARKER

Is this what they call 'returning

to the scene of the crime'?

(CONTINUED)

52.

PLAZA MANAGER

I assure you, Mr. and Mrs. Lo

Biancho, The Plaza will do

everything in its power to see

that The Emperor is safely

returned and that the criminals

are brought to justice.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

Justice?! I want them executed!

Tortured first, slowly, and then

beheaded!

PLAZA MANAGER

The Plaza's policy is of course to

serve you in any capacity we can.

MORTY

(calling)

Bruce!    10-80 at the wagon wheel!

DREW

(no breath)

Park...

(CONTINUED)

53.

MORTY

Damn it!

BRUCE

Where'd they go?

HOGAN

They couldn't have gone very far.

We'll split up.

(pointing)

You go that way! You take Fifth!

Come on, get on your horse!

WILLIAMSON

Coffee?

HOGAN

Sure.

WILLIAMSON

(to hot dog vendor)

Two black.

HOGAN

Where do you think those two went?

WILLIAMSON

Beats me. They didn't have any

stupid dog with them from what I

could see.

HOGAN

Might have stashed it.

(CONTINUED)

54.

WILLIAMSON

Maybe they ate it.

WILLIAMSON

The rent-a-cop said the mutt's

worth like 50 G's. That makes it

grand theft, my friend. Five to

ten.

HOGAN

(to blind cashier)

Hey, Speedy. You didn't see a

couple of blondes run past here,

did you?

SPEEDY

Yep. Couldn't miss 'em. Real

criminal types. Looked like they

were headed to Mexico.

HOGAN

That's where they all go.

WILLIAMSON

See you around.

SPEEDY

Not if I see you first.

HOGAN

I say we put Abbott and Costello

on the ransom watch. I don't want

to be stuck in the same room all

day with Leona Helmsley's nasty

stepsister.

(CONTINUED)

55.

SPEEDY

Whew. You know, it's not some old

wives' tale about blind people

having an acute sense of smell.

DREW

Sorry.

SPEEDY

So? What did you do with that

dog?

DREW

We didn't steal it, I swear.

PARKER

A painter did.

SPEEDY

You girls best give yourselves up

and tell 'em the story.

DREW

(torn)

He's right, Parker.

PARKER

Of course he's right. We're going

to march in there and give

ourselves up right this minute.

They will, of course, take us down

to the precinct, call Mom and Dad,

we'll give our statement, they'll

grill us under hot lights for a

few hours, force us to confess

with some tricky good cop/bad cop

routine and the next thing you

know we're doing five to ten in

Attica.

DREW

So we'll turn ourselves in right

after the interview.

SPEEDY

May I make one suggestion?

(CONTINUED)

56.

PARKER

Sure.

SPEEDY

Hit the showers before you do

anything else.

DREW

We're facing felony charges,

Parker. Maybe you can do your on-

line flirting later. Better yet,

he can see you during visitor's

hours.

PARKER

(beat; epiphany)

Oh my God. Warren works in the

city.

DREW

Warren? WARREN?! So you lied,

right to my face. No, Drew, this

isn't about the chat room guy.

Nah!

SPEEDY

(to guy)

Take your daughters to work day.

DREW

Are you listening to me?!   Give me

that stupid thing!

(CONTINUED)

57.

PARKER

Knock it off, Drew! This guy

might be able to help. He lives

here.

DREW

Parker, you have completely lost

your mind if you can be thinking

about boys at a time like this!

PARKER

(to Drew)

The United Nations?

DREW

You can't possibly know somebody

who works at the United Nations.

Maybe he meant United Sub

Sandwiches. Or United Skate Rats

Store.

PARKER

So. We're going to the United

Nations to use the restroom.

DREW

How convenient. You arrange a

little date while your sister's

future hangs in the balance.

PARKER

Look, he said he'd help and it's

only a couple blocks away. You

got a better idea?

(CONTINUED)

58.

SPEEDY

(how's he know?)

Coast's clear.

PARKER

Thank you, Mr. Speedy.

SPEEDY

You're quite welcome.    Good luck

in that interview.

Hey, Marvin. You bet.    Typing

CHARLEY

(suddenly concerned)

Today?

(beat)

Gee, I'm on a real roll, Marv.

The juices overfloweth, if you get

my meaning. Don't want to plug

the juices when they're

overflowing, right?

(whoa)

How much?

Hm. I guess I could carve out

some time.

Got it.   See you in the City.

CHARLEY

Hello, beautiful Doctor Lady. How

goes your day?

(beat; huh?)

Right next to the magazine rack?

What did they name it, Newsweek?

(beat)

I'm going into the City to meet

some big shot publisher. Maybe

I'll swing by NYU afterwards and

see if I can give Drew a ride

home. You talk to her today?

(beat)

She's probably having too much fun

to call. I'll ring her up. Bye

bye.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

(to Caterer)

What are those?

CATERER

Rumaki, ma'am.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

Rumaki! Yech! You might as well

wrap dog turds in bacon. Take

them away.

BABS

Andrea, Andrea. How dreadful!      I

shudder to think how the poor

Emperor may be suffering.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

Dear Babs.     I'm at wit's end.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

(putting on a show)

You! Tell the thieves I'll pay

anything they want! Anything!

BABS

Of course.     What price on a loved

one?

MRS. LO BIANCHO

Precisely!

BABS

I've got to    run. That stupid

groomer used    a commercial

conditioner    on Coco and she looks

like trailer    trash.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

I'll give them ten grand, tops,

but only if the dog's back before

show time.

BRUCE

(aside to Morty;

whispered)

Do you know how to turn this on?

CUT TO:

PARKER

We're going to make it, Drew.

You'll see. There's still plenty

of time. You'll get cleaned up,

we can trade clothes... this is a

nice suit, huh? Right?

DREW

(abrupt)

Yes.

PARKER

You're going to get accepted, then

we can explain the

misunderstanding about the dog to

the police and everything will be

okay.

DREW

Maybe after the police forgive us

for sneaking into someone else's

hotel room, we can ask them to

please keep the mob hit man from

whacking us and dropping us into

the marina so he doesn't get his

suit dirty.

PARKER

First things first.

DREW

Parker, I know you're trying to

cheer me up, but I have to be

honest. This is all your fault.

(CONTINUED)

62.

PARKER

(beat)

My fault? MY FAULT?! I didn't

mean for any of this to happen!

DREW

Yeah, right! Like you didn't mean

to ask Bernie Lipscomb to the

prom!

PARKER

What's that supposed to mean?

DREW

I'll bet that was just another

accident of yours that happened to

screw up my life!

PARKER

Bernie Lipscomb?

(dawning)

You...?

PARKER

You liked Bernie, too?

DREW

You know I did!

PARKER

No I didn't.  I haven't seen you

talk to a guy since we were in

kindergarten and we thought Jerry

Wester was a girl.

DREW

You asked Bernie just to snake him

from me!

PARKER

I did not!

(beat)

Wow, the really spooky thing is,

that would mean we liked the same

guy.

(CONTINUED)

POLICEMAN

Isn't that those two right there?

POLICEMAN #2

I'll be damned.

POLICEMAN

Where the hell did they go?

POLICEMAN #2

(into radio)

605 to Base. We spotted the

dognapping suspects, corner of 1st

and 49th.

POLICE OPERATOR (V.O.)

(from radio)

Copy that, 605.

CUT TO:

64.

POLICE OPERATOR (V.O.)

Car 91, 605 reports suspects

spotted at 1st and 49th.

HOGAN

(to radio)

605, do you still have visual?

POLICEMAN #2 (V.O.)

Negative. But they can't be far.

They're on foot.

WILLIAMSON

(to Hogan)

That's over by the U.N.

HOGAN

(to radio)

See if you can pick them up.

We're on our way.

CUT TO:

WILLIAMSON

(pointing)

There they are.

HOGAN

What in the world could they be

doing here?

DREW

(re: Warren)

Do you see him?

PARKER

No.

TOUR GUIDE

(conspiratorially)

I can't tell you how much I've

looked forward to this.

BRUNETTE

(in Russian)

Momma?

TOUR GUIDE

Sorry.   My mistake.

DREW

Oh, shit.   What now?

PARKER

(out loud)

Warren? Does anyone know Warren

Collier?

(CONTINUED)

66.

WARREN

Parker?

PARKER

Gee, Warren. Isn't that strange?

I didn't recognize you from your

picture.

WARREN

Yeah, I, uh...

DREW

(urgently)

We don't have time for this now.

PARKER

Do you have an office or someplace

private we could go?

WARREN

I just have to do this tour and...

DREW

We'll get back to that.

WARREN

What's going on?

PARKER

It's important.

WARREN

(beat)

Okay. Let me get somebody to

cover for me.

(CONTINUED)

67.

WARREN

Hey, Angie, take the 11:00 for me,

will you?

ANGIE (TOUR GUIDE)

No way.    Judge Judy's on.

DREW

Angie?    Take the 11:00.

ANGIE

(to Warren)

You owe me, Warren.

PARKER

Are you a lying sack, or what?

WARREN

What was I supposed to do? I

liked you. If I'd sent a real

picture, would you have met me?

PARKER

That's not the point.

WARREN

That means no. At least this way

I got to see you before you blow

me off.

DREW

No one is blowing you off, Warren.

As a matter of fact, we're very

happy to see you, aren't we,

Parker?

PARKER

I guess.

DREW

And we're grateful for your help.

PARKER

This is my sister, Drew.

WARREN

Not-a-twin, huh?

(CONTINUED)

68.

PARKER

That's a joke.

WARREN

Yeah, well. I guess everybody

would like the world to see them a

little bit differently than they

are.

DREW

(quickly interjecting)

Super. Now that that's all

settled, is there a restroom I can

get to without going out there?

WARREN

What's wrong with going out there?

PARKER

Police, for one thing.

WARREN

Police?   I thought you guys were

joking.

PARKER

It's the kind of joke that will be

a lot funnier a few years from now.

WARREN

Well that door's the only way out.

There's a restroom at the end of

the main hall.

DREW

They there?

PARKER

I don't see 'em.

DREW

They must be searching the

building.

(CONTINUED)

69.

WARREN

What'd you guys do, anyway?    Mug a

couple supermodels?

DREW

Let's go.

HOGAN (O.S.)

(spotting them)

Hey!   You two! Stop!

WARREN

This way!

DREW

(to person in stall)

Are you okay?

CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE

(near fatally

nauseous)

Ohhh... I'm so sick. The mussels

at lunch. You have to help me.

DREW

I'm kind of in my own private hell

right now.

CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE

What's your name?

DREW

Drew.

CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE

Drew... it's vitally important.

CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE

Please.    You have to take this to

Canada.

DREW

Uh, Canada?    It's sort of far away.

CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE

(struggling)

In the Assembly. Give the file to

Mr. Wakefield, the Canadian

representative.

(GROANNN!!)

Please. I can't... get up.

DREW

You want me to take this to the

Canadian Representative to the

United Nations?

CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE

Hurry!    This is a crisis!

DREW

(confused but...)

Okay.

DREW

Where's the Assembly?

CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE

To the left.    Run!

CUT TO:

WARREN

He's gone.

WARREN

(no better idea)

You have nice breath.

Thank you.

Maybe we should get out of this

sack.

Impossible! This would be

Sir?

CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE #2

Yes...

DREW

Oh, no. You didn't have the

mussels at lunch, too, did you?

CHINESE REP

This crisis falls at the feet of

one nation and one nation only!

CANADA!

(CONTINUED)

73.

CHINESE REP

How do you defend such a position!

The world is waiting to hear!

DREW

Well, I'm not certain...

DREW

(recovering)

... that I NEED to defend our

position!

NORTH KOREA

(subtitles)

Is she new?

NORWAY

Beats me.

NORTH KOREA

She's hot.

NORWAY

Weird hairdo.

CHINESE REP

That is absurd!

DREW

Absurd?!

(CONTINUED)

74.

DREW

(dramatic emphasis)

Not so absurd, since I have the

documents right here in my

possession!

CUT TO:

PARKER

How are we going to find Drew?

WARREN

Something tells me that won't be

too tough.

CUT TO:

DREW

And besides, who said absurd is

necessarily bad? Sometimes absurd

is good! For instance, absurd can

be sort of... funny! In conclusion,

I propose that all of you should

talk amongst yourselves.

(quickly)

Thank you.

KOFI ANAN

Canada has proposed further

debate.

U.S. REP

The United States of America

seconds the motion!

WARREN

Jin zshe miya BRAD PITT!

WARREN

Dingo cashito, BRAD PITT ezukai!

PARKER

You speak Japanese?

WARREN

I may not look like an underwear

model, but I'm smarter than a

hundred of them put together.

WARREN

Come on!

PARKER

We don't have any money!

WARREN

I'm smart AND rich!

76.

PARKER

Follow that... uh...

DREW

They're following US, Parker!

PARKER

Oh, yeah.   JUST GO!

WILLIAMSON

Maybe we should give them a little

leash and see what they do with

it.

HOGAN

Fine. But we're gonna have to

stop for lunch pretty soon, 'cause

I'm getting heartburn.

PARKER

Excuse me, what were you doing?

DREW

Someone was sick in the bathroom

and they asked me to -- hold on, I

don't owe you any explanation.

PARKER

You're the one all 'I gotta get to

this interview or I'm gonna have a

nervous breakdown' and yet you

have time to address the United

Nations?

(CONTINUED)

77.

WARREN

You know, technically, you have to

have security clearance to enter

the Assembly.

PARKER

Not now, Warren.

DREW

You have a lot of nerve, Parker.

It was you that got me tossed off

the train! You had to give the

bum that dollar! You get the

suit, I get the leather bikini!

WARREN

(under)

Which isn't so bad.

DREW

And you got Bernie Lipscomb while

I got Scrabble with Mom and Dad!

WARREN

Who's Bernie Lipscomb?

PARKER

I told you, I didn't know you

liked him! It was no big deal!

DREW

It was to me!

PARKER

How could I know? You never tell

me anything!

DREW

There's a good reason for that!

PARKER

What's that supposed to mean?

DREW

You know very well what it means,

Ms. Big Mouth!

PARKER

Big mouth?! Ooh, I hope you miss

that stupid interview!

(CONTINUED)

78.

DREW

Oh yeah? Well, the joke's on you,

because there isn't any interview!

PARKER

What?

DREW

(beat)

No interview. I screwed up.

PARKER

You screwed up what?

DREW

Scheduling the interview.    You

deaf?

PARKER

You're Drew. Drew doesn't screw

ANYTHING up, let alone scheduling.

You're the Iron Chef of

scheduling.

DREW

I missed the deadline.

PARKER

How?

DREW

After they made the first cut from

the preliminary application, we

were supposed to send in a form to

secure our interview time and I

filled it out and had everything

ready to go in the mailbox and

then...

PARKER

And then what? Earthquake?

Tsunami? Nuclear winter?

DREW

I forgot.

PARKER

Forgot?

(CONTINUED)

79.

DREW

Yes. I just forgot. When I found

it in my bag a week later, I'd

missed the deadline.

PARKER

So today?   All this?   What are you

doing?

DREW

(humiliated)

I... I was going to try to meet

Professor Spaulding and...

PARKER

You were just going to jump him?

WARREN

Sort of a guerilla interview?     You

know, I'm a big Michael Moore

fan...

DREW

I called and the secretary said

there were no exceptions to the

deadline so I was going to try to

see him when he finished the other

interviews. I knew it was

hopeless, but... I was so...

embarrassed.

DREW

Oh, to hell with it.

PARKER

Drew?!   Drew, get back in this

taxi!

WARREN

She's pretty upset.

(CONTINUED)

80.

PARKER

Gee, you really are a genius.

PARKER

Talk about spontaneous.

DREW

Darn it!   DARN IT DARN IT DARN IT!

DREW

That's... that's the painter.

WILLIAMSON

Did one of them just get out?

HOGAN

I think so.   Maybe she's going for

the dog.

WILLIAMSON

Maybe that's what they want us to

think.

HOGAN

So we stay with the taxi?

(CONTINUED)

81.

WILLIAMSON

Unless you want to hoof it after

the other one.

HOGAN

We stay with the taxi.

Stupid dog.

ROGER

MRS. LO BIANCHO

One hour.   Take it or leave it.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

You have one minute to decide.

ROGER

Well, Mr. Fancy Pants. You can

wipe that stupid smile off your

face. I don't think they love you

as much as you think they do.

PARKER

Where'd she go?

WARREN

I think she took a right up there.

PARKER

Follow my sister.

TAXI DRIVER

MRS. LO BIANCHO (V.O.)

Yesss?

ROGER

Okay.    Here's how we make the --

MRS. LO BIANCHO (V.O.)

(interrupting again)

-- First of all, you forgot to

disguise your voice.

ROGER

(to himself)

Damn it!

MRS. LO BIANCHO (V.O.)

Secondly, my husband will meet you

in ten minutes on the corner of

43rd and Broadway. He'll have the

money. Bring the dog.

ROGER

But that's ridiculous!     You'll

just bring the police!     No way!

Consider him Kung Pau!

MRS. LO BIANCHO

Fine.

ROGER

Don't hang up!

MRS. LO BIANCHO

The police, it appears, have other

priorities, like humans or

something. And I assure you, the

Hotel Security... people... will

not interfere. In any case,

little man, we just want the dog

back before showtime, do you

understand?

(CONTINUED)

84.

ROGER

(beat)

Okay.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

Ciao.

ROGER

(to The Emperor)

No wonder you look so happy. As

far as you're concerned, you've

escaped from the Wicked Witch of

the West.

ROGER

(to Emperor)

Knock it off.

ROGER

Hey!    Give me that dog!

DREW

I just want you to know that I'm

allergic to you AND cynophobic!

(CONTINUED)

85.

MR. LO BIANCHO

Excuse me?

DREW

I can't stop!    I have to return

this dog!

ROGER

I'll be right back!

WARREN

Uh, isn't that your sister?

PARKER

It can't be.    She's terrified of

dogs.

HOGAN

I'm telling you, I got a hunch

these girls don't have anything to

do with this dog.

Oh, go ahead.

DREW

I, uh, just wanted to return him.

MRS. LO BIANCHO

Flog her! Step aside and I'll

whip her myself!

MR. LO BIANCHO

Didn't you say it was a man who

called, Dear?

MRS. LO BIANCHO

So she had an accomplice! We'll

beat the information out of the

Get him cleaned up, Emile.

I didn't take her dog, I swear.

WILLIAMSON

We'll sort it out.

But I have this interview. I

mean, it's not really an

interview. I'd never lie to the

police...

(it's over)

... never mind.

WARREN

What now?

PARKER

We have to go to the jail and tell

them what happened.

WARREN

What on earth did happen?

PARKER

Poor Drew. She wanted to get into

that program more than anything in

the world.

BENNIE

You goin' somewhere?

WARREN

(gulp)

Hello, sir.

PARKER

Oh my God!   Please don't kill me!

WARREN

Kill?

(CONTINUED)

PARKER

We don't know anything at all! We

didn't see anything or hear

anything and I'll swear to that in

a court of law!

PARKER

Just not in the face.

BENNIE

What's the big idea? You two a

couple a nutbags or somethin'?

PARKER

Nut bags? No. I mean,    yes. Is

there a right answer to  that?

See, my sister had this  interview

which turned out not to  be an

interview, really and I  sort of

messed things up because  I wanted

to meet him.

WARREN

Really?   You came into town just

for me?   Wow.

PARKER

Not now, Warren.

(back to Bennie)

Drew was going to be late even

though technically she wasn't

going to be late since there

wasn't an interview and that's

when we got in your car. I

promise we meant to pay. It was a

true emergency.

BENNIE

I meant, why you runnin' when I'm

trying to give you your bag back?

PARKER

You were just...?

(CONTINUED)

92.

BENNIE

I found your mom's number in the

book. She said you needed it

pretty badly for that big

interview. Listen, I gotta go.

It's my mother-in-law's birthday

and I gotta plant some stupid rose

bush and then take her out to

dinner at the Pier. See ya

around.

PARKER

(beat; calling after)

Thank you?

WARREN

Well, he certainly is a good

Samaritan.

WARREN

You guys lead a pretty interesting

life, don't you?

WARREN

We going to the jail, or what?

I've never been to a jail before.

PARKER

What time is it?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RED (INMATE)

I love your outfit.

DREW

Thank you.

RED

Is it Bobo?

DREW

(how in the world

would this woman

know?)

Yes, as a matter-of-fact, it is.

RED

He's a genius.

CUT TO:

PARKER

Try to keep up, Warren!

WARREN

(calling after her)

Hey! I'm an intellectual! I

never claimed to be athletic!

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

94.

WARREN  (CONT'D)

As a matter of fact,  I was excused

from P.E. because of  an ascended

testicle!

(realizing)

Too much information,   right?

CUT TO:

RED

Do you mind?   I'm a fanatic for

Jimmy Choo.

DREW

It's all yours.

HOGAN (O.S.)

MacLeod?

HOGAN

You're free to go.

DREW

No thanks. I'll just stay here

with the girls.

HOGAN

An eyewitness says he saw who took

the dog. Didn't realize the guy

was stealing it until he saw us

grab you.

(CONTINUED)

95.

HOGAN

There's your alibi.

DREW

I don't even know him.

HOGAN

That's what he said. Go home.

Get cleaned up, a good night's

sleep. None of this will seem so

bad in the morning.

BIKE GUY

You okay?

BIKE GUY

I'm Jim Wessler.

DREW

Thanks, Jim.    How'd you know?

JIM (BIKE GUY)

Who could forget that face?

DREW

Huh.    No hives.

DREW

Well... bye.

JIM

Wait.    Where are you going?

DREW

Thanks for getting me out of jail

but I have to go home now because

my entire life is ruined.

(CONTINUED)

96.

JIM

Bad day, huh?

DREW

You turn understatement into an

art.

JIM

Can you just tell me your name?

Please?

DREW

(sigh)

I'm Drew MacLeod. The girl who

won't be going to the NYU

Accelerated Program.

JIM

Why not?

DREW

Because short of flying, there's

no way to get from here to NYU in

five minutes.

JIM

Sure there is.

CUT TO:

WARREN

Wow.   And I thought I was anal.

PARKER

This is no good. I don't do too

well with the whole rehearsal

thing. I'm more of a 'wing it'

person.

(CONTINUED)

97.

PARKER

(all business)

How's this look? Drewish?

WARREN

You know, I've always had a thing

for librarians.

PARKER

Warren, honesty is fine. But you

could edit a little, you know?

WARREN

Got it.

PARKER

Wish me luck.

WARREN

Good luck, Drew.

CUT TO:

SECRETARY

May I help you?

PARKER

I'm here to see Professor

Spaulding.

SECRETARY

You don't have an appointment.

PARKER

(beat)

Um, no. However...

(CONTINUED)

98.

PARKER

Professor Spaulding?

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

Yes?

PARKER

May I have a moment of your time?

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

I'm sorry, but I have a plane to

catch.

PARKER

I know. But this is very

important.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

What is this about?

PARKER

Life and death, if you must know.

PARKER

I'm Drew MacLeod.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

Ms. MacLeod, I hope this is

interesting.

PARKER

Trust me.

JIM (O.S.)

Yo!    Coming through!

(CONTINUED)

99.

JIM

You okay?

DREW

Fine.

DREW

Wait right there.

(beat)

I mean, I don't want to be bossy.

You don't have to stay right

there, if you don't want to.

JIM

I'll be right here.

DREW

Great.

PARKER

(primly)

I promise you, though my missing

the deadline seems to suggest

otherwise, my studies would never

suffer on account of my being

unorganized. This was, and I

think anyone who knows me would

vouch for this, a complete

anomaly.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

100.

PARKER (CONT'D)

I was so thrown when my sister

asked Bernard to the dance that I

simply failed to post the schedule

request and seeing it already

checked off on my to-do list, I

over-looked it until after the

deadline had passed.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

Ms. MacLeod, I recall your

application being one of the

strongest we received. Not seeing

your name on the interview list

surprised me. I assumed, of

course, that you'd changed your

mind.

PARKER

No. Not at all. This program is

my number one priority.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

Yes, well, I'm sure you can

appreciate that with so many

applicants for so few spaces there

must be rules to govern the

selection process.

DREW

Professor Spaulding? I can't

apologize enough for barging in

like this.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

No. Please. It looks like I'm

taking the red-eye now anyway.

DREW

Parker?

PARKER

(worried wink)

Hi, Parker.

(CONTINUED)

101.

DREW

What are you doing?

PARKER

(don't blow it)

Oh, the Professor and I have had a

wonderful talk about how important

this program is to me and how it

was my sister, Drew, who screwed

things up.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

I'm having a little trouble

following this.

DREW

You were... being me?

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

(to Drew)

Would you like to sit down?

PARKER

When I saw them take you to

jail...

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

Jail?

PARKER

... I didn't think you'd make it.

I knew I wouldn't be any good at

it, but I figured at least there

was a chance.

DREW

(beat)

That's... sweet.

PARKER

You're not mad?

DREW

No.

PARKER

I'm so sorry for today.

(CONTINUED)

102.

DREW

It's okay.    But let's talk about

it later.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

Please.    Go right ahead.

PARKER

Thank you.

DREW

Parker, consider, just for a

moment, whether this is the

appropriate time and place.

PARKER

Okay, I considered.     What I want

to say is, I didn't    purposefully

set out to ruin your    day, but that

doesn't mean I'm not    a little...

jealous.

DREW

Jealous?

PARKER

I'm not like you. I don't have

your intensity, your focus, your...

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

Fashion sense?

PARKER

I just mean, maybe, even if I

don't intend to, maybe that

jealousy, you know, gets in the

way sometimes.

DREW

You mean subliminally you're

undermining me?

PARKER

I don't know if I'd get that

technical about it. But yeah.

DREW

Well, thank you for saying that.

PARKER

You're welcome.

(beat)

Aren't you going to confess now?

(CONTINUED)

103.

DREW

Confess what?

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

There's got to be something. Like

how you lost your shoes?

PARKER

How you're secretly jealous of me?

DREW

Why would I be jealous of you?

PARKER

Oh, let me see. Because I don't

have a stick up my butt? Because

I know how to have fun? Because

I'm spontaneous and creative and

men are all my love slaves?

DREW

Nope.

DREW

Well, maybe about the love slaves.

DREW

Professor, I'm Drew MacLeod.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

Are you certain?

DREW

I wanted more than anything in the

world to be a part of your

program. I still do. But I

failed. I didn't follow the

rules. And honestly, before

today, I didn't know how I was

going to live with that. How to

live with failure. I'm not good

at it. I haven't done it much.

But today I realized that I've

lived in fear of it too long.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

104.

DREW (CONT'D)

I hope my application was a strong

one and I came here today to ask

your indulgence and to place my

name back into consideration. If

you won't, I'll understand.

Better yet, I'll get over it.

Maybe I shouldn't be in such a

hurry after all. Maybe it would

be best for me to just take

this...

DREW

... and lighten up.

DREW

Thanks for your time. Sorry if

you missed your plane.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

It was worth it, I assure you.

Now, could you clear up one thing

for me?

DREW/PARKER

Sure.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

What's this about jail?

CUT TO:

DREW

Thanks.

(CONTINUED)

105.

PARKER

Sis?

DREW

Yeah?

PARKER

Gotta go.

CHARLEY

Hi, baby!

CHARLEY

I was in the city. I tried to

call you. Thought you might want

a ride home.

DREW

Sure.

CHARLEY

(what?)

Is that a new outfit?

DREW

Yeah.     Hey, one minute, 'kay?

CHARLEY

Sure.

DREW

Thanks.

JIM

You're welcome.

DREW

I, uh...

(CONTINUED)

106.

JIM

You want to maybe... get together?

DREW

First I want to take a shower.

For about a week.

DREW

Call me, okay?

JIM

You have a card? Aren't you in

high school?

PARKER

Oh, man. I'm doomed.     I'll never

get home before them.

WARREN

Sure you will.

WARREN

Dad?   Hey.   I need a favor.

PARKER

Warren, something tells me you're

spoiled!

WARREN

Yes!   But in a good way!

DISSOLVE TO:

(CONTINUED)

107.

QUINN

(sternly)

Girls?

QUINN

How naive do you think I am?

PARKER

We, uh, don't think you're naive,

Mom.

DREW

No. Honestly, it was all an

accident.

QUINN

I know what this is.

QUINN

Parker, I'm disappointed you'd do

something like this without

consulting me, but Drew? What got

into you? Do you know how

unhygienic those places are?

DREW

It was... spontaneous.

QUINN

Yeah. Obviously. Oh, by the

way...

QUINN

This came in the mail.

PARKER

So?   Open it.

(CONTINUED)

108.

CHARLEY (O.S.)

The guys are here!

PARKER

Come on!

DREW

It doesn't really matter one way

or the other. Maybe I shouldn't

be in such a hurry. Why don't we

go out and have some fun.

Besides, if this isn't good news,

I don't want it to ruin our night.

CUT TO:

CHARLEY

So, how'd you two meet the girls?

JIM/WARREN

(simultaneously)

A dance/A class.

CHARLEY

Dance class, huh? Stupid    me. I

figured it had to be that   day in

New York when Parker blew   off her

chem test and Drew was in   jail.

CHARLEY

(offering)

Chips?

FADE OUT.

THE END
