ROBBIE

(sardonically)

Yeah. This is great. I love this plan.

Drag me kicking and screaming from my

happy home in California to some weird

place in Colorado, and say hey, this'll

be fun Robbie. Maybe we can go

camping....

CONNIE

Look, I know you're not happy about this.

But it wasn't my idea for your father to

have some kind of mid-life crisis and

disappear with his secretary to Mexico

with our life savings.

ROBBIE

"Administrative Assistant." There's no

such thing as a secretary anymore.

CONNIE

Fine. Administrative Assistant. We

couldn't afford to sit around waiting any

longer to see if he was coming back. I

was able to land a good job here. And

now thanks to Uncle Bernie you have this

job at the Water Park...

ROBBIE

(shaking his head)

Grounds crew. What kind of job is that?

It sound like the guy who cleans out the

coffee pots.

CONNIE

Bernie says you help keep the park clean,

sweep up, that sort of thing.

I'm sure it won't be so bad. Besides, a

lot of the kids who work at this park go

to the same high school you'll be going

to. You can start the school year with

some ready-made friends.

ROBBIE

I had friends in Oceanside. I had

something to do for the summer.

CONNIE

Hanging out at the beach surfing with

your friends is not my idea of something

Page 4 of 81

to do. This way you'll make some money

and meet people here. You'd best get

used to it. This is where we live now.

We're staying.

ROBBIE

All thanks to Dad and his secretary.

CONNIE

Administrative Assistant.

ROBBIE

Whatever.    Some summer....

CONNIE

Promise me you'll give it a

try....please?

ROBBIE

(giving in to the inevitable)

I will. I promise. See you later

7       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY FRONT GATES OF WATER WORLD            7

ALEX

(back still to ROBBIE)

...and so SHE says I'll have the filet

AND the lobster". I had to borrow twenty

bucks from Fitzgerald just to get out of

the restaurant.

DOUG

(waving to ALEX)

By the way. Where is that twenty bucks?

ALEX

(avoiding)

Ohhh, hey Dougie. I'll catch up with you

later...

(turning around to ROBBIE as

not to continue the

conversation)

Hey, how you doin'? Haven't seen you

before.

Page 5 of 81

ROBBIE

(nodding)

I'm Robbie. Robbie Zirpollo.

ALEX

I'm Alex.     Where you workin'?

ROBBIE

I believe it's with the Grounds Crew?

ALEX

What's the matter, can't swim?

ROBBIE

(surprised)

I can swim. Why?

ALEX

Well, you look old enough to be a guard.

ROBBIE

Almost 16.     I get my license in

September.

ALEX

It's just that most of the guys on

grounds are a little younger than you.

Most guys your age that can swim are

guards.

ROBBIE

Well, I just moved here. I guess I

missed guard tryouts. You're a guard

then?

ALEX

Oh, no no no. I work concessions...at

Aokee's Surf and Snack Shack. It's just

as well. The guards are mostly stuck up

anyway. The rest of us are the ones who

know how to have fun.

ROBBIE

Can't swim, huh?

ALEX

(smiling)

Nope.

ROBBIE

(listening to speaker on post

above)

What is that?

ALEX

(mimicking his perception of

surfers)

Surf tunes, dude!

Page 6 of 81

(back to his own voice)

You'll get used to it. You'll get to

where you miss it. I had to buy two CD's

just to get through the winter.

ALEX (CONT'D)

(gesturing)

Ahh. And here we have the fair Melissa,

time clerk extraordinaire...

MELISSA

(shaking her head no)

Oh, Alex. Am I going to have to put up

with your crap for another entire summer?

ALEX

(looking upward toward the sky)

Dear Melissa.

There's nothing about our relationship

that couldn't be fixed by us spending a

few moments together in the pumphouse

behind Thunder Bay.

MELISSA

Yeah, well from what I hear, it would be

a BRIEF few moments.

ROBBIE

(wincing)

Ouch.

ALEX

(not missing a beat)

My dear, you cut me to the quick. Check

off my name and that of my amigo here,

Mr. Robbie Zirpollo.

MELISSA

(handing them cards)

Fill out these emergency cards, and turn

them in when you pick up your

uniforms....

(pointing)

over there. And Alex?

ALEX

(to ROBBIE)

She wants me.

(turning back to MELISSA)

Yeeees?

MELISSA

(finger pointing)

This year, let's clock in only our OWN

time card, shall we?

ALEX

Page 7 of 81

(head shaking, to ROBBIE,

walking together)

Some people have no sense of humor.

8       EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - OUTSIDE UNIFORM BUILDING         8

ROBBIE

(taken aback, breathing in

through his nose)

Whoa....who was that?

ALEX

(unimpressed, putting his hand

on ROBBIE's shoulder as if to

hold him back, like a horse

that is riled up)

Eeeaasy there, big fella. Not in your

lifetime.

(wistfully, glancing over)

Or mine.

ROBBIE

So who is she?

ALEX

Miss Tiffany Maxwell, daughter of Big

Mike Maxwell, owner and operator of this

here fine water park.

ALEX (CONT'D)

See, Princess Tiffany and her friends

pretty much have the run of the park.

Her boyfriend is Dan Peterson, a guy we

all call Cowboy, one of the lifeguards.

Pretty decent guy from what I can tell.

But she's a piece of work. Your best

strategy is to steer clear of her and she

won't cause you any trouble.

ROBBIE

Cowboy, huh. Big guy?

ALEX

Big. Guy.

ROBBIE

(takes in a deep breath)

Page 8 of 81

Hmm.

MALE UNIFORM GUY

Hey Alex.

(calling back to FEMALE UNIFORM

PERSON)

Aokee's. Large.

(to ROBBIE)

MALE UNIFORM GUY (CONT'D)

Name?

ROBBIE

Rob Zirpollo. Uh, Robert Zirpollo

MALE UNIFORM GUY

(looks on clipboard)

Grounds?

(looks at FEMALE UNIFORM

PERSON)

MALE UNIFORM GUY (CONT'D)

(and FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON,

together, ominously)

Grounds.

ROBBIE

(to ALEX)

So what is this grounds thing, anyway?

ALEX

Let's just say....you are critical and

indispensable to the ongoing operation...

and....flow of things here at the park.

(he and MALE UNIFORM GUY

exchange a knowing glance)

FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON

Here you go, tiger. One grounds.

Medium. You have a pair of green shorts

at home?

FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON (CONT'D)

Buy some. Tonight. Wear them tomorrow

along with this shirt. You need to

report to the area just south of Surf's

Up. Look for a guy wearing Army pants

and glasses.

ALEX

I'll show him. I'm going in that

Page 9 of 81

direction.

(to ROBBIE with feigned

excitement)

You get to meet The Colonel!

ALEX (CONT'D)

(marching)

Left. Left. Left right left.

9       EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK       9

AOKEE

(to person on the line)

David...how you do this to me? I have

full staff with you. I save your spot.

I was counting on you.

(listens, nods)

Yes, yes....but The Gap? What you think

you do there? Are there girls in

swimming suits? Have you forgotten?

(listens, shaking head)

Tips. Do you get tips? Cash money?

(listens some more)

AOKEE (CONT'D)

(resigned)

Well, come see us this summer, eh?

You're a good kid...a good worker.     Yeah,

you too.

ALEX

Who....?

AOKEE

David. Seems to think there is future in

retail. Now what I do? I'm one person

short. Park opens tomorrow.

ALEX

(thinking)

You know...I just met a guy that's old

Page 10 of 81

enough to work here, but he's stuck in

grounds.

AOKEE

(perking up)

Good guy?

ALEX

Seemed like our kind of people.

AOKEE

We need to get him before he get his

plunger!

10        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - TRAIL FROM AOKEE'S TO SURF'S10

AOKEE

(out of breath)

Alex......

(wheeze)

..you got to go ahead...

(wheeze)

...stall 'til I get there.

ALEX

(nodding, running in place)

OK.

11        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH          11

Page 11 of 81

THE COLONEL

(looking up from clipboard)

Well, it looks like we have a good staff

here. Yes...yes a good staff. It will be

an excellent summer. Remember as we go

through training today, our park is

judged by the work WE do. If we do it

well, the people come back.

(walking up and down the line)

We have a little tradition here on the

grounds crew. Rather than having to

learn a lot of names, many of which I can

never hope to pronounce properly, each

grounds crew member gets a grounds crew

nickname. You will be known by that

nickname in every way except, of course,

your paycheck and employee records.

THE COLONEL    (CONT'D)

Let's see, what do we    have? Hmm...yes.

OK, first up is Eddie    Cochran. Your

grounds crew nickname    will be.....Eddie!

THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

Now crewmembers, listen up. Eddie here

has eight years experience on the grounds

crew. Why, I'd like to think there isn't

anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't

faced. Listen to him. Learn from him.

Watch what he does. This man is the

finest, most conscientious grounds

crewman we've ever had.

THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

Let's see...Clark? Hmmm. Your grounds

crew nickname will be....Sparky.

Page 12 of 81

SKEETER

Sorry, sir. Mosquito.

THE COLONEL

Hmmm.....your grounds crew nickname will

be.....Skeeter.

THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

(looking at the clipboard)

Bradley, is it? OK, Mr. Bradley.....your

grounds crew nickname will be Snitch.

THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

Melinda Tally. Hmmm... your grounds crew

nickname will be...

(thinking)

ALEX

Hello, Colonel!

THE COLONEL

(thinking, staring)

Alex, isn't it?

ALEX

Yes sir, Colonel. And what a fine staff

you've assembled this year. Have you

told them yet about your army background?

THE COLONEL

Well, no, I didn't think it was..

ALEX

Page 13 of 81

(interrupting, to the grounds

kids)

The Colonel here is very modest. Did you

know that he reorganized the entire

process of cleaning and sanitizing an

army barracks and its latrines?

THE COLONEL

Well, it really wasn't much of a...

ALEX

(interrupting again)

Wasn't much?

(again, to grounds kids)

Can you just imagine for a moment the

germs and bacteria our American soldiers

could pick up in an unsanitised army

latrine? It's impossible to determine

just how many lives have been saved

thanks to the efforts of this one humble

Army Colonel.

THE COLONEL

Well, I suppose when you put it that

way...

ALEX

(to the grounds kids)

I, too, came up through the ranks when at

age 14, I began my service here at Water

World learning from this great man.

THE COLONEL

Yes....I remember now.....what was your

grounds nickname...?

ALEX

Not even sure I remember it myself, sir.

But I remember much more. Did you tell

them about the film?

THE COLONEL

Film?

ALEX

(to THE COLONEL)

"Hygiene Makes You Happy"

(to the grounds kids)

Every enlisted man in the army has seen

it. Some by choice. All from the mind

of The Colonel here...

THE COLONEL

(to himself)

I never forget a grounds nickname....

THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

Page 14 of 81

(concerned)

Aokee, good God, man...are you OK?

AOKEE

Colonel....terrible mistake...

ALEX

(quietly behind AOKEE)

Bureaucratic bumble...

AOKEE

Bureaucratic bumble....

ALEX

Lost paperwork....

AOKEE

Lost paperwork....

ALEX

An error in the front office...

AOKEE

Error in front office....

ALEX

Spiced applesauce....

AOKEE

Spiced...

THE COLONEL

Good God, man, what are you trying to

say?

ALEX

It's Robbie sir. He was supposed to work

at Aokee's and through some crazy mix-up,

he ended up here.

THE COLONEL

(looking at clipboard)

Zirpollo? Well this is highly

irregular...

ALEX

(can't pass this up)

Page 15 of 81

Most annoying....

THE COLONEL

Most annoying....

ALEX

Never happened before....

THE COLONEL

Never happened before....

ALEX

Spaghetti marinara...

THE COLONEL

Spa....what?

(exasperated)

Well, if he was supposed to be assigned

to you, we'll just have to let him go...

ROBBIE

(to THE COLONEL)

I was confused myself, sir. I had heard

I was working for some Hawaiian guy.

AOKEE

(reassuring)

I promise, we go straight to personnel,

straighten the whole thing out. You

won't need to worry.

THE COLONEL

Very well.     We'll just have to make-do.

THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

(remembering)

Snafu.

MELINDA

Sir?

THE COLONEL

His grounds crew nickname.     I remember it

now. Snafu.

Page 16 of 81

BIG MIKE

(motioning to get everyone to

settle down)

Okay, everybody, let's quiet down for a

minute.

(they do, and he looks down at

his clipboard)

For those who don't know me, my name is

Michael Maxwell, and I...sort of run

things around here.

EVERYONE TOGETHER

Big Mike! Big Mike! Big Mike!

BIG MIKE

(again motioning to settle

down)

Okay, yeah thanks. Now, I want go over a

few basic things. First of all, make

sure you've all filled out your paperwork

with personnel, cause nobody gets paid

unless they do. Come to think of it, I

suppose it's better for me that you don't

fill out your paperwork, then I don't

have to pay you. I'll make it optional.

If you want to get paid, fill out your

paperwork.

(looking at clipboard)

Let's remember, the people who come here

are our guests, and your job is to see

they have a safe and fun experience here.

Let's work together to keep the park

clean and safe, and we'll have a great

summer together. Now with a few words is

our head lifeguard, Richard Thompson.

SMALLER GROUP

Big Dick! Big Dick Big Dick!

RICHARD

(wincing some, but not

Page 17 of 81

surprised, motioning to settle

down)

Yeah, yeah, very funny, we're all very

amused. Okay, many of you have been in

training for some time, and some of you

still have a ways to go...

RICHARD (CONT'D)

(glancing at the water wing

group wistfully, almost to

himself)

...a long ways to go...

RICHARD (CONT'D)

...but I'd like to take a moment to

speak, mostly to the guards, but

certainly everyone has a role in this.

We can take everything we've learned and

distill it down to two simple rules.

Rule number one:

RICHARD (CONT'D)

(loudly, emphatically, angry at

the thought that anybody

might...)

Don't drown!

RICHARD (CONT'D)

(almost quietly)

Rule number two:

RICHARD (CONT'D)

(loudly, emphatically)

Don't let anyone else drown!

RICHARD (CONT'D)

(almost quietly to the stunned

crowd)

Thank you. Have a great summer!

ALEX

Page 18 of 81

(breaking the silence)

Alright! Whoo whoo!

13        INT - MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK      13

ALEX

(to ROBBIE)

Hey, hey lookin' good. Blue is your

color. Beats that stupid t-shirt, huh?

AOKEE

(unhappy, stressed)

Alex! You are late. Come on, is opening

day!

AOKEE (CONT'D)

(to ROBBIE and ALEX)

You two start setting tables.

AOKEE (CONT'D)

(to ALEX, gesturing)

Alex. Come here a minute.

AOKEE (CONT'D)

(with intensity)

Alex, look. We falling apart. I made

you assistant manager this year. Go

assistant manage.

ALEX

Page 19 of 81

(agreeing)

No problem.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Sorry, Sarah, but I need to borrow this.

SARAH

(surprised)

Hey! How did you know I wear shorts

under that?

ALEX

(mock surprise, rolling his

eyes)

Oh, Puh-leeaase.

ALEX (CONT'D)

(to all)

Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your

attention, please?

ALEX (CONT'D)

In exactly 30 minutes, hundreds of

dripping wet customers with fistfuls of

money smelling of chlorine and suntan

lotion will be walking in here.

And what will they be looking for?

(as if directing a choir)

EVERYONE TOGETHER

(except ROBBIE, who doesn't

know any better)

The best teriyaki east of the pacific!!!

ALEX

Annnnnnd?

EVERYONE TOGETHER

(Again except ROBBIE, who

doesn't know any better)

The finest smoothies in the state!!!

ALEX

Now, everyone's a little tense, except

me, of course. So to help you get in the

proper frame of mind and relax, we need

Page 20 of 81

the right soundtrack.

(to AOKEE)

Maestro?

ALEX (CONT'D)

This is little tune I like to call the

Paradise Slide.

(mouthing with the song as it

starts)

One, two, a one two three.

EVERYONE TOGETHER

(on the chorus)

Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho,

Don Ho.

AOKEE

(to ALEX and ROBBIE)

You did good work today.

Here. I made you some of my special

Power Smoothies. More customers later

wanting dinner before park closes. I

can't have you falling asleep on me.

AOKEE (CONT'D)

(to ALEX)

Alex, we are completely out of table

stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.

Take Robbie and go find some. I think

some at the first-aid station near Surf's

Up pool.

ALEX

(nodding knowingly)

Right. See you in a little while.

15        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY CONCESSIONS AREA             15

ROBBIE

So that was a typical lunch crowd?

ALEX

Well, it's early in the season yet.

We'll get busier.

ROBBIE

(incredulous)

Busier?

ALEX

(laughing)

Don't worry. You'll get used to it.      And

tips were good, right?

Page 22 of 81

ROBBIE

There's nothing like cash money in your

pocket. What's that over there?

ALEX

Oh, you'll find this ride interesting.

16        EXT - MOMENTS LATER - DAY - THE WAVE AREA                      16

ALEX

(as a rider falls)

It's a lot harder than it looks.

ROBBIE

I can't imagine it's that difficult.

(to himself)

...no rudder on the board...

ALEX

Now this is a place of many wonders.     See

those guys in line over there?

ALEX (CONT'D)

We call them "Wave Bums". They all have

season passes, and do little more than

ride the wave all day long. Some of them

get pretty good.

ALEX (CONT'D)

That's where they hang out when they're

not riding the wave. Don't get too close

to them.

ROBBIE

No?

ALEX

(sniffing)

Contact high.

Page 23 of 81

ALEX (CONT'D)

And there, my friend, is another one of

The Wave's features.

ALEX (CONT'D)

We call them "Wave Babes". And there's a

special secret to this ride.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Hey, Bob....can I borrow your radio a

minute?

BOB

Sure.

ALEX

(into radio)

Hey Frank, it's Alex.

FRANK VO

(heard through the radio)

Yo, Alex.

ALEX

(into radio)

Listen you have a possible code 4.

(to ROBBIE)

Means a "hottie".

ALEX (CONT'D)

(to radio)

She's up next. A free chicken sandwich

and a smoothie if you bounce up the

pressure a bit.

FRANK VO

(heard through radio)

You got it bud. But two smoothies.

"Volcanos".

ALEX

(to ROBBIE)

He knows my weak spot.

(to radio)

Two Volcanos and a chicken sandwich.

FRANK VO

(heard through radio)

Time to go to ludicrous speed!

Page 24 of 81

ALEX

(to ROBBIE, still holding the

radio)

Watch, and wait....

ALEX (CONT'D)

Yesss!

SKEETER

(unaffected)

Excuse me... Miss?

(louder)

Hello...excuse me...?

SKEETER (CONT'D)

(holding up the bottom to her

swimsuit)

Is this yours?

ROBBIE

(looking at ALEX)

You were right. I was interested in

Page 25 of 81

this.

ALEX

Well, sometime bring your swimsuit.

We'll come back on break. I'll show you

how to do it. Surf's is this way. And

keep an eye out for Frank over there. We

owe him.

Hey. I've been sent to find some table

stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.

DOUG

Oh, you must be the new guy at Aokee's.

ROBBIE

Yeah, how'd you know?

DOUG

Lucky guess. Saw some at the top of

River Country. Just ask one of the

guards over there.

ROBBIE

Thanks.

DOUG

And hey...tell that wienie Alex he still

owes me twenty bucks!

ROBBIE

stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.

KATIE

What? Amy, this guy is looking for a

table stretcher?

AMY

(coming over)

Aokee's huh?

ROBBIE

(surprised)

Uh, yes...

AMY

(to ROBBIE, seeing ALEX in the

background)

They're all down at Big Mike's last I

saw.

(to ALEX)

When you gonna tell him?

ALEX

Hi, Amy.   Who's this?

AMY

Katie, this is Alex and...

ROBBIE

(taken with KATIE)

Robbie. Ummm, Rob Zirpollo.

AMY

Well, anyway, Big Mike's is where they

are.

ROBBIE

Thanks.

AMY

What a couple of losers.

KATIE

I don't know...I thought Robbie was kind

of cute...

AMY

Listen, you're new, so let me tell you

how things are. First those guys were

wearing blue shorts. That means

Page 30 of 81

concessions.

(uses her fingers to explain)

The Water World social structure is

organized on three levels. At the bottom

are the Trash Rats.

KATIE

Trash rats?

AMY

Bottom feeders. Grounds kids. Babies.

They clean the toilets and empty the

trash. Most are only 14 years old. It's

the only job younger kids can do here.

Next up is concessions. They're our

"middle class". We don't hang with them

and they don't much hang with us. At the

top of heap are the guards. You are a

guard. Girl, if you want to go out with

someone, stick with your own kind.

KATIE

(looking off at ROBBIE and ALEX

walking away)

Aw, that's just silly. I think he's

cute.

ALEX

About what?

ROBBIE

him?

ALEX

I'll tell you over a hamburger at Big

Mike's.

ROBBIE

(Shaking his head)

Aokee's not going to be happy. Nobody

seems to know where these things are...

ALEX

(smiling)

Yep.

(now laughing)

ROBBIE

What?

ALEX

There's no such thing as a table

stretcher or a left-handed coffee pot.

ROBBIE

What a dirty trick.

ALEX

(smiling)

It's just Aokee's way of giving you a

tour of the park without having to be

there. Consider it a rookie initiation.

ROBBIE

(still mad)

Humph.

ALEX

Time to make it up to you.    Come on.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Now, if he ever shows up at our back

door, we owe him chicken and smoothies.

ROBBIE

But...don't we get an employee discount?

Shouldn't we go in the front?

Well...the discount is larger this way.

Stupid Pigeons. They should all die!

ALEX

(to ROBBIE)

ROBBIE

(to AOKEE)

What is this thing for anyway?

AOKEE

Someday, Robbie.   Someday.

ALEX

(to ROBBIE)

That stand is to display the coveted

Surfer King trophy.

Aokee seems to think that one day some

concessions kid with more courage than

brains is going to beat the lifeguards in

the annual Employee Olympics.

ROBBIE

And what would this concessions kid have

to do?

ALEX

Nothing, really. Just out surf the

strongest guard of them all in the

surfing competition. No big deal.

ROBBIE

Has it ever happened?

ALEX

A guard always wins the surf competition.

Know why?

TOGETHER

(ROBBIE and ALEX)

Because concessions kids can't swim!

AOKEE

Hi there.

ROBBIE

(blinking, smiling)

Hello. On break?

KATIE

Yeah.   Two Blue Crushes please.

ROBBIE

Coming up.

AMY

Oooh. Umbrellas.       I've never gotten

umbrellas before.

ROBBIE

These are only for VIP guests.

ALEX

Amy. Have you ever seen the fabulous

Cummings and Robbins 2000-B?

AMY

(shaking her head)

I don't think so.

ALEX

It's incredible.      It washes 2000 plates

an hour....

KATIE

(to ROBBIE)

So... you're not from around here, huh?

ROBBIE

California. I just moved here at the

beginning of the summer.

KATIE

I'll bet California's nice.      I've never

been west of the mountains.

Page 35 of 81

ROBBIE

You'd love the ocean. And the sunsets

are incredible. You can almost hear the

sizzle as the sun drops into the ocean...

(daydreaming a bit)

Of course, we all know it doesn't drop

into the ocean.

KATIE

No.

(pause)

I'm surprised you're not a guard, coming

from the ocean and all.

ROBBIE

Let's just say I missed my chance, and

Alex saved me from a death worse than

fate. I was very nearly a trash rat.

KATIE

(frowns)

Oh. Good save.

AMY

Well. That was exciting. Maybe next

time you can show me how to scrub the

grill. Come on, Katie.

ALEX

(to ROBBIE, interested)

Well...how'd you do?

ROBBIE

(thinking)

Mmmm. I told her how beautiful the

California sunsets are.

ALEX

Good job. You work fast. Hey it's time

for our break. Bring your swimsuit?

ROBBIE

Yeah.   The Wave?

ALEX

The Wave.    I love that water.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Can't swim. It's only three inches deep.

ROBBIE

(grabbing his suit and a towel)

Ah ha! Let's go.

Now, just take it easy, and don't expect

too much at first. When you wipe out,

your ride is done.

ALEX (CONT'D)

(shouting)

Just ease into it.

ALEX (CONT'D)

(meeting him at the exit)

Gees. Where did you learn to do that?

ROBBIE

I'm from Oceanside, California.    I was

born on a surfboard.

ALEX

Think you could ride that?

ROBBIE

(looking right into ALEX's

eyes)

In my sleep.

What you so happy about?

ALEX

Page 37 of 81

(shaking his head)

You're not gonna believe it...

AOKEE

Listen. Some guy came in today and try

to buy a sandwich and pay with a phone

card. Today I believe anything.

ALEX

I took Robbie to The Wave today.

AOKEE

(looking around)

What? He drown?

ALEX

No. It turns out that he's from

Oceanside. California. You know, where

they always hold those surf competitions?

AOKEE

Yeah.   So?

ALEX

It turns out that he placed second in the

state high school finals for the

shortboard competition. As a Sophomore.

AOKEE

Robbie.

(laughing in disbelief,

dismissive, then serious)

Robbie barely walk without help.

ALEX

I saw it myself.      You wouldn't believe

it.

AOKEE

I don' believe it.      Our Robbie?

ALEX

Our Robbie.

AOKEE

(thinking)

If this true....this could be da year.

ALEX

That's what I was thinking.

AOKEE

Well, go get him. We need to make ready.

He not just walk in and win this thing.

ALEX

You heard it. He's in the kitchen...

Page 38 of 81

AOKEE

Robbie, sit down. Alex, make up a

Volcano. This boy in training.

ROBBIE

(sitting down, worried)

What did I spill now?

AOKEE

Robbie, Alex tell me you are some kind of

surfer. This true?

ROBBIE

I dunno. Yeah, surfing is usually how I

spend my summers.

AOKEE

You know about Employee Olympics?

ROBBIE

Yeah.   Some kind of trophy.

AOKEE

Surfer King trophy. Very big.     Very

nice.

(looking down)

Concessions never win.

ROBBIE

I dunno...seems kind of silly to me.

ALEX

It's a big deal. Every girl     wants to date

you. Every guy wants to BE      you.

Special privileges...we all     wear standard

uniforms.   The Surfer King     gets to be

creative. You ever see the      cowboy hat

Cowboy wears?

ROBBIE

It shouldn't be that hard...how good

could this Cowboy be?

AOKEE

He very good. His family go to Hawaii

every year, two, three weeks. Good

surfer. If you do this, you need to see

Pipeman.

ROBBIE

Page 39 of 81

Pipeman?

ALEX

He's a myth.

AOKEE

Oh, no. Pipeman very real. Works here

in park. Low profile. You must find him

and convince him to teach you the secrets

of the Thunder Bay wave. This not the

ocean, surf boy.

ALEX

(thinking)

Pipeman. The Banzai Pipeline. I get it.

Some kind of legendary surf champ. Where

do we find him?

AOKEE

I only see him once, maybe twice. Stay

behind scenes. But here he is and find

him you must.

(to ROBBIE)

So. You do this?

BIG MIKE

(angry)

....why you wouldn't believe the things

I've heard. Just stupid things. Cutting

in line. Demanding special treatment.

Oh, and how about this one:

(mimicking her)

Princesses don't carry trash.

(back to his voice)

I've often thought it was a mistake to

have you work here. Maybe I was right.

Page 40 of 81

TIFFANY

(trying to dance out of it)

Oh, daddy. You know how jealous people

get.

BIG MIKE

I'd almost believe that. But I was behind

the First Aid station when you said the

"princess" line. This park exists

because the kids here work hard. They

need to be treated fairly. They need to

see you are just another lifeguard.

TIFFANY

(protesting)

But I'm not just another lifeguard.

BIG MIKE

(mad again)

You won't even be that if this continues.

If you want to keep coming here every day

and driving that little convertible of

yours, I need to see real, concrete

changes in your attitude.

TIFFANY

All right.     What do you expect me to do?

BIG MIKE

For one thing, start mingling with "the

commoners". You'd be amazed at how nice

some of the people who work here are.

Make some friends outside that little

group of yours. It's the work of the

average teenager here that puts food on

our table. Show some gratitude.

TIFFANY

(thinking a moment)

Fine. I'll work it.

BIG MIKE

(softening, but firm)

Good. Work on it. Please?

TIFFANY

(nodding, but we don't believe

her)

Oh, Daddy. Don't worry about a thing.

ROBBIE

I don't how much fun it will be.     With

Aokee hosting, we'll be working.

ALEX

There'll still be time for fun. Most of

the work is setting up. Besides, we get

paid, too. When was the last time you

got paid to party?

OK. You work hard, and we fine now.

These never fail.

ALEX (CONT'D)

(to ROBBIE, but if front of AMY

and Katie)

Now this will never do.

ROBBIE

(agreeing)

I'm afraid you're right.     Something must

Page 42 of 81

be done.

ALEX

Oh, yes,    yes....

ROBBIE

Perfect.    A work of art.

AMY

I don't remember anything like this on

Aokee's menu.

ROBBIE

They're..

ALEX

(interrupting)

..special smoothies. Fortunately, you

know people on the inside.

JAFFA

We'd like thank Aokee and his crew for

hosting this evening's Luau.

JAFFA (CONT'D)

We'd also like to bring Aokee up to sing

one of his Hawaiian specialties.

ALEX

You girls want to dance?

KATIE

(grabbing ROBBIE's hand and

leading out to the dance

floor)

Sure.

AOKEE

(onstage)

Page 43 of 81

Mahalo and Aloha. This song is sung on

my island for all young people in

love...or about to be. Is called E

O'Mai, or, You Are Mine.

KATIE

So. How are things working out at

Aokee's?

ROBBIE

Oh, he's great. Alex too. I thought

this summer was going to be a train

wreck, but it's not turning out too bad.

KATIE

Well, of course this isn't California...

ROBBIE

No, but it looks like I will get a chance

to do some surfing anyway.

KATIE

Really.

ROBBIE

Apparently there's some kind of surfing

contest and Aokee is all over me to

enter.

KATIE

You mean the Surfer King?

ROBBIE

You've heard of it?

KATIE

It's all the other girls seem to talk

about. This is my first year, but

Page 44 of 81

apparently it's a pretty big deal. Being

from Oceanside, you should have a good

chance.

ROBBIE

We'll see. It seems kind of stupid to

me. A surfing contest in Colorado.

(laughing)

My friends back home would never believe

it.

DOUG

(to ALEX)

Alex. Got my twenty bucks?

ALEX

Oh, Dougie. You know, I left my wallet

over in my locker. I'll see you before

we leave and get it to you then.

DOUG

Yeah, sure.

ALEX

You know, you could always come by

Aokee's and I could give it to you in

trade.

DOUG

Cash money, Alex.   Cash money.

ALEX

No problem.

Page 45 of 81

ROBBIE

(to KATIE)

Hey, listen. Alex told me about this

great spot on the other side of Thunder

Bay that looks down on the party, but

it's a little more quiet. Want to go for

a walk?

KATIE

Sure.

37        EXT MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - NORTH EDGE OF THUNDER BAY          37

KATIE

So...what made your folks pick up from

beautiful southern California and move to

Colorado?

ROBBIE

Not both my folks.   Just my Mom.

KATIE

Aha...trouble in paradise?

ROBBIE

Let's just say my father had an eye for

his administrative assistant, and now

they're both somewhere in Mexico. Mom

got a job here, some of her family's

here, so they said "Colorady is the place

you outta be".

KATIE

It could be worse.

ROBBIE

Well, I must admit, I've met some very

nice people.

(looking down and smiling)

In California, the attitude's a little

different. Here, not everyone is out to

prove something. Seem's like everyone

just wants to have fun.

KATIE

I have a theory. Sometimes it snows here

so hard, that it's a challenge just to

get to work or to school. Everything

shuts down for a day or so. If your car

gets stuck, people appear from nowhere to

help pull you out and get you back on the

road. Most people here don't just look

out for themselves. A lot of times,

Page 46 of 81

they're looking out for you, too.

ROBBIE

(quizzically)

So where did you learn to dance like

this?

KATIE

(smiling)

Eight years at Miss Vickie's Studio of

Dance. What surprises me is you.

ROBBIE

(somewhat embarrassed, keeps

dancing)

Can you keep my deepest, darkest secret?

KATIE

Of course.

ROBBIE

(hesitantly)

When you grow up within spitting distance

of Hollywood, every mother seems to think

her child is the next Harrison Ford. So

when I was about 12, my Mom started

taking me to all these auditions for

things.

KATIE

So are you the next Harrison Ford?

ROBBIE

Some days I'm not even the next Robbie

Zirpollo.

Page 48 of 81

KATIE

....and?

ROBBIE

Turns out I get this part. They're

selling some dish soap or something, and

they think it will be magical to have

two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom

on this fantasy set with clouds and

everything. They lock this girl and I

into a dance studio with a choreographer

for two weeks, and then they shoot the

commercial.

KATIE

Doesn't sound so terrible.     You certainly

learned how to dance.

ROBBIE

Yeah, but when it came out everyone in

school saw it. I couldn't go anywhere

for six months without everyone in the

room laughing their heads off.

KATIE

(touched, drawing closer)

I'm not laughing.

Yeah, sorry. Are you Pipeman?

Not on purpose.

I guess some people call me Pipeman.

'Spose it's better than Carl.

ROBBIE

So you're real name's Carl?

PIPEMAN

No. I just said Pipeman was a better

name than Carl.

ROBBIE

Oh. Well, my name's Robbie.      I work at

Aokee's.

PIPEMAN

Oh. OK.   What the hell you doin' down

here?

ROBBIE

I need your help.

PIPEMAN

That scrubsink at Aokee's leakin' again?

Gees, I knew we shoudda replaced...

ROBBIE

It's not the scrub sink. I need your

help. I'm competing in the Employee

Olympics. With your advanced surfing

experience, Aokee thought you might be

able to help me.

PIPEMAN

(to himself)

Everybody wants to be the Surfer King.

(to ROBBIE)

What advanced surfing experience?

ROBBIE

Well, you know. "Pipeman"? Hawaii's

North Shore? Surfing the pipeline?

PIPEMAN

Ohhh. Bad news, kid. I hate to

disappoint you, but this is the reason

they call me Pipeman. I'm the plumber

around here.

Page 51 of 81

ROBBIE

Oh, boy. See, I'm from California, and

I can surf, I just don't know what to

expect from the wave on Thunder Bay.

I...I was just hoping you could help, I

really am sorry for bothering you.

PIPEMAN

Wait a minute, kid. I do know a little

about surfing. I also know a lot about

the wave here. What exactly are you

looking for from me?

ROBBIE

(perking up)

I need a mentor; you know like in Karate

Kid.

PIPEMAN

Karate Kid. He works at Big Mike's

doesn't he?

ROBBIE

No, no it's a movie.

PIPEMAN

Never seen it. Don't know much about

this mentor thing. How's it work?

ROBBIE

Generally, you, as mentor, draw on some

personal religious philosophy to first

intimidate, and then later inspire me.

What religion are you?

PIPEMAN

(proudly)

I'm Norman.

ROBBIE

Ah, Brigham Young and all that.

PIPEMAN

No, no NNNNORM-AN. We follow the big fat

guy on Cheers reruns.

ROBBIE

Okay...and your belief structure....

PIPEMAN

Usually involves a lot of beer and corn

nuts, but I don't think that's gonna work

here.

(thinking)

Tell you what.

Meet me at Thunder Bay tomorrow morning,

Page 52 of 81

eight a.m., bring your board and we'll

work something out.

ROBBIE

Great, perfect. Thanks. I won't let you

down.

What's that?

PIPEMAN

This is how I trigger the wave.

ROBBIE

With that?     A garage door clicker?

PIPEMAN

What did you think? Waves just happen?

This is Colorado, kid. Now get your

board and get in the water.

PIPEMAN (CONT'D)

You sure that's where you want to be?

ROBBIE

Should be about right. Aren't you

getting in? Where's your board?

PIPEMAN

Mentors don't get wet. I looked it up.

Get ready.

Want to know what you did wrong?

ROBBIE

Just gimme another wave.

PIPEMAN

Oakey doakey.

ROBBIE

Okay. Please. Tell me what I did wrong.

PIPEMAN

You're in the wrong position. The wave

doesn't crest that soon. Move ten feet

further away from the back wall.

(entering from kitchen)

Sorry, dude, that tray was way off

balance.

AOKEE

Robbie, our secret getting out.     You

practice too good.

ROBBIE

(happy)

I'm really getting the hang of that wave.

AOKEE

Fall more.     Make good show.

ROBBIE

(thinking)

I'll try to remember to look and see

who's watching.

AOKEE

(pours the rest of RICHARD's

smoothie)

Good. Here, have a smoothie. You too

skinny to surf good.

53        EXT EARLY MORNING. - THUNDER BAY                               53

PIPEMAN

(gesturing)

OK, now this time, get up on the board

more quickly. This is a wave pool and

this wave dissipates quickly. You only

have a little time to show your stuff.

ROBBIE

How will the judging work?

PIPEMAN

You get a possible ten points. Three for

your surfing, three for your style and

four for the judge's overall impression

of your ride. No one's ever gotten a

ten...I'm not really sure why.

ROBBIE

You've seen the competition.     What does

everybody do?

PIPEMAN

Everybody just surfs, man and tries not

to fall. The big reason Cowboy's done so

Page 56 of 81

well is he goes to Hawaii for a couple

weeks every year. But there he's mostly

a longboarder. Your job is to figure out

how to make the most outta this little

wave.

ROBBIE

OK.   I'm ready.

54        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - HILL ABOVE THUNDER BAY          54

COWBOY

He's pretty good, I'll give him that.

TIFFANY

(concerned)

How good?

COWBOY

If I have an off day, he could win.

TIFFANY

(really concerned)

That's terrible. You're the Surfer King.

COWBOY

Well, some days you get the wave, and

some days the wave gets you.

TIFFANY

This can't happen.   What are we gonna do?

COWBOY

I don't know what you're going to do, but

as me for me, I'm gonna schedule some

practice time of my own.

TIFFANY

This may take a lot more than extra

practice.

COWBOY

Well, I don't know what else you expect.

I'll go out and do my best. If that's

not enough, it's not enough.

55        EXT. MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK           55

Page 57 of 81

Hey, surfer boy! I got fifty bucks at

three to one! Don't let me down, mon.

ROBBIE

(to JAFFA)

Hey Jaffa. NO worries.

(to ALEX, shocked)

People are betting on me?

ALEX

Just a little friendly pool. No big

deal. Helps make this more interesting.

Concessions never had a chance before...

ROBBIE

I've seen this Cowboy practice. His

style is more longboard, and this is a

shortboard wave, but he's still pretty

good. I could lose you know.

CONCESSIONS GIRLS

(together)

Hi Robbie!

ROBBIE

How ya doin'

(to Alex after they have gone

by)

See. How come everyone knows me by sight

now?

ALEX

Ah, you're the next big thing. You'll

survive it. The Employee Olympics are

only a week away. What happens is we

have this big opening ceremony where each

team chooses a theme and we're judged on

our spirit. Then different teams compete

in contests that test their Water World

skills. The next morning it all ends

with the surf contest. You ready?

ROBBIE

I suppose. I've been working out a

strategy to use if Cowboy has a real good

day. It's risky...

TIFFANY

Well, hello Robbie.

ROBBIE

(surprised)

You know me?

Page 58 of 81

TIFFANY

Of course I know you. It's my father's

park, I try get to know everyone.

ALEX

(interrupting, eager)

I'm Alex!

TIFFANY

Yes, I'm sure you are.

(ignoring ALEX, back to Robbie)

It's been a while since I've been to

Aokee's. Do you suppose if I come down

in a little while you could make some of

that special chicken, what is it?

ROBBIE

The best teriyaki east of the Pacific.

TIFFANY

Yes...and one those smoothies I hear so

much about?

ROBBIE

(stunned)

Well, sure. I'll be working all

afternoon.

TIFFANY

It's a date then.    See you later!

ALEX

Come on, we gotta get back.

ROBBIE

(still shocked)

Yes. Yes we do.

AOKEE (CONT'D)

Second time this week. Our boy Big Man

on Campus, huh?

ALEX

Big something. I hope he knows how to

work without a net.

AOKEE

Well. We all grow up sometime. He not

drop a tray of dishes in days. Something

going right.   You think he ready?

ALEX

I guess we'll both find out on Sunday.     I

sure hope so.

AOKEE

(looking through the papers)

This isn't good.

(looking at ALEX and ROBBIE)

It's the same as every year. Pretty much

a dead heat going into the surf

championship tomorrow morning.

ALEX

I can't believe those guys screwed up the

CPR.

ROBBIE

Hard to blame them. No one told them

they had to put their mouth on yours

until the last minute. Yuck.

ALEX

Bunch of babies.

AOKEE

(to ROBBIE)

It's going to be up to you. We slip a

little. You have to make up. That

trophy need a new home.

AOKEE (CONT'D)

You need to make up. You ready? Tomorrow

morning last event. You our last hope.

TIFFANY

Hi Robbie.

ROBBIE

(shy but still very much

smitten)

Oh. Hey.

TIFFANY

How's your team doing?

ROBBIE

Uh.   OK, I guess.      Kind of a tie.

Page 68 of 81

TIFFANY

Well, I think you're going to take care

of that tomorrow morning. In fact, I've

planned a little celebration in advance.

We're going to this incredible party up

in the foothills at some friends of mine.

ROBBIE

(intrigued)

Party, huh? That sounds like fun.       I

have to work until nine tonight.

TIFFANY

That's perfect. I'll come back here and

pick you up.

TIFFANY (CONT'D)

Oh, and Robbie...call your mom and tell

her you're spending the night at Alex's

or something. It's going to be a very

special night.

ROBBIE

(hypnotised)

K...

66        INT. EVENING - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK                      66

ALEX

(voice somewhat hushed)

I'm telling you we need to talk him.

Something's going on.

AOKEE

(shaking his head no)

Robbie know the right thing to do.     He's

a good boy.

ALEX

So how about this? He tells me I've got

to cover for him if his mother calls. He

told her he's spending the night at my

house.

AOKEE

He say that?

ALEX

Yes. Tiffany's got something up her

sleeve and Robbie's too messed up to

Page 69 of 81

notice.

AOKEE

(reflective)

Spending the night at your house.      This

very bad. Very bad.

AOKEE (CONT'D)

He should be done with the dishes by now.

Tell him we want to talk.

ROBBIE

Hey. I'm done with the pots and pans.

It's almost nine. Can I take off now?

AOKEE

Robbie, please, sit.

ROBBIE

Everything OK?

AOKEE

That's what we gonna ask you.    What you

plan tonight?

ROBBIE

Well, Tiffany invited me to a little

party up in the mountains.

AOKEE

Robbie, you athlete. Big day tomorrow.

You need sleep, not party.

ROBBIE

It's no big deal.   I'll be fine.

AOKEE

Is big deal. Robbie. You good boy,

smart, everybody like you, but....

ROBBIE

But...

AOKEE

Face it. Only one reason Tiffany

interested in you. She want to make you

so tired and so crazy you lose tomorrow.

ROBBIE

(disbelief)

Aw, come on...

Page 70 of 81

ALEX

Robbie. She's still going out with

Cowboy. I saw them together at the

movies two nights ago.

ROBBIE

Maybe she's just letting him down easy.

ALEX

Robbie...things...things are not always

what they seem to be.

ROBBIE

Like what?

AOKEE

In this case, she acts like she likes you

when really she wants Cowboy to win.

ROBBIE

Naw. You guys are nuts.      She's not like

that.

ALEX

She is like that.

ROBBIE

Look, I know what to believe and what not

to. I'm not that easily fooled.

ALEX

Aokee?

AOKEE

(shaking his head)

Go ahead. Tell him. I trust him.

ALEX

OK. Take Aokee for instance.      Gentle,

genial Hawaiian guy, right?

ROBBIE

Sure. He's great. I love working here.

Aokee, you've been real good to me...

ALEX

Then let me introduce you properly.

Robbie Zirpollo, meet Manuel Ramirez.

ALEX (CONT'D)

Manuel's family snuck across the border

ten years ago through Juarez, Mexico.

AOKEE

(accent gone)

My father refused to work for a drug lord

who ran our town. They tried to kill

Page 71 of 81

him.     We barely got out with our lives.

ROBBIE

Aokee?

AOKEE

(accent now Mexican)

A name I picked up reading an obituary in

the paper. I sent away to Hawaii and got

his birth records and social security

number. This way, I never have to worry

about immigration. I spent weeks

watching tapes of Hawaii Five-O just to

get the accent right. "Book 'em Danno".

Huh. What's that all about?

ROBBIE

(to Alex)

And you knew?

AOKEE

I burnt my hand on the grill one day and

started swearing in Spanish...

ALEX

(interrupting)

And I said, boy, you speak Spanish like a

native....uh oh. It's been our little

secret. Now it's your secret, too.

ROBBIE

(looking at his watch)

I need to think about all this.

ALEX

(nodding)

You do.

AOKEE

Sleep tonight. Sleep well.

ROBBIE

(gets up, dazed)

Right. Goodnight.

ALEX

Not yet.

ROBBIE

(looking in the same direction)

What you lookin' at?

AOKEE

We looking for you.        How you sleep?

ROBBIE

I slept fine.

(pause as AOKEE and ALEX wait)

I decided I'm not my father. I don't run

out on the people I care about just

because some blond shakes her ta-ta's at

me.

AOKEE

(relieved)

We go then.

ALEX

She shook her ta-tas? No one said

anything about shaking ta-tas.

(reflectively)

This puts a whole new light on things!

ROBBIE

Get going!

HEAD JUDGE

(looking down at clipboard)

Alright, here's the deal. You get three

tries; three heats. We judge each run

and only your high score counts. If you

fall you get no score for the run. Your

score will be added to the total for your

team, and the winner gets the Surfer King

Trophy. Any questions?

HEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)

Then let's begin. Grounds is up first.

Page 74 of 81

BIG MIKE

(clearing his throat,

flustered)

It looks like we have a tie. This has

never happened before, but I seem to

remember we provided for this possibility

in the rules. Hopefully our judges can

help us figure out what to do!

HEAD JUDGE

Reading from the rules, "...in the event

of a tie at the end of three heats in the

surf competition, the teams who are tied

will participate in a sudden-death surf

off. Additional heats will be run until

a winner can be declared."

(looking up at the crowd)

The "Sudden Death" heat will begin in

five minutes.

HEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)

You want to go first or second?

ROBBIE

Second.

HEAD JUDGE

Be ready in five minutes.

AOKEE

So what you do?   Wait for him to go crazy

and fall?

ROBBIE

Don't want to win with him falling.

PIPEMAN

You could always go out and do your very

best, take a lot of chances and maybe win

this thing on merit.

ALEX

(dismissive)

Don't be silly. That only works in the

movies.

ROBBIE

(shakes his head)

Actually, that's exactly what I'm

thinking. It's the reason we're in a

tie. I've been too conservative. I've

got to do everything I can, or just

forget about it. It's all or nothing.

(pause)

We gotta pull the fin.

AOKEE

Pull da fin?

PIPEMAN

You think you can hold it?

ROBBIE

(explaining)

One time, these tourists from Japan on

the beach at La Jolla offered me a

hundred bucks to do a full spin at the

top of the wave, and then slide down and

cut back and do a full back flip. I

pulled it off. A friend of mine had a

tricks board with just a single fin and

foot pockets.

PIPEMAN

We gotta pull the fin. What do we do

about the foot pockets?

ROBBIE

You got duct tape?

PIPEMAN

What kind of plumber would I be if I

didn't have duct tape? Water World

Page 76 of 81

Platinum!   Where do you want them?

ROBBIE

Here and here.

AOKEE

So, help me understand.      What you do now?

ROBBIE

Pipeman is taking the extra fins off my

board. I only need one to make a deep

cut back. He is also putting some

pockets to slip my feet into so when I

flip upside down, I don't lose the board.

ALEX

Flip upside down?

ROBBIE

A back flip. You guys see it on

snowboarders here all the time, I'm sure.

ALEX

Oh yeah, I'm sure I did that last winter.

But not on purpose! Dude. You're either

gonna win this thing or you're gonna die.

AOKEE

(quickly, eagerly)

It would be better if you won.

ROBBIE

Yeah, well, a tie is like kissing your

sister.

ALEX

(mock anger)

You stay away from my sister.

PIPEMAN

Ready!

ROBBIE

(to PIPEMAN)

I'll need the biggest wave you can give

me...

PIPEMAN

(imitating Mr. Scott on Star

Page 77 of 81

Trek)

I'll give 'er all she's got, Cap'n!

AOKEE

(dropping his Hawaiian accent)

Robbie. When you do this, do this mostly

for Robbie Zirpollo. But do it just a

little bit for Manny Ramirez, eh?

You know, that's what I hear. Maybe I

should work there next summer.

Well. Just another summer at Water

World.

ROBBIE

You know Katie, I really am sorry I was

such a jerk this summer.

KATIE

We'll be going to the same high school.

You'll have plenty of chances to make it

up to me. Let's see, there's Homecoming,

the Christmas Dance, Valentines Day...and

of course, the prom...

ROBBIE

Alex?

ALEX

Yeah?

ROBBIE

I'm gonna need to borrow twenty bucks.
