The Professor's fingers touch the signs.

Every five thousand years..

So I have some time..

He reaches for the pad.

I will take it to them my son.

Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.

PRIEST

Go with God.. be safe from Evil..

The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing

As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.

the Terror just so.."

His fingers run on.

Aziz!  Light!

The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.

Amen..

The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup

PROFESSOR

Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing..

the greatest find in history..can you imagine

the implications.

Only too well... here you must be

He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost

I mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin.

As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the

He points to the Five Elements.

A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am

Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

The Priest hands Billy a cup.

PRIEST

Drink!

PROFESSOR

To fame.. salud..

The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...

PROFESSOR

We cannot toast with water.. Billy !

In my sack.. the Grappa!

The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.

A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow

Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag.  He comes upon a

The Professor keeps reading over the inscription.

PROFESSOR

"..this perfect person.. this perfect

being.." I do not understand this.. perfect?

PROFESSOR

Where is that boy? Billy!

Billy presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but

The Professor reads the wall.

PROFESSOR

And this divine Light they talk

about.. what is Divine light?

At that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again.  The light

PROFESSOR

(without turning)

Aziz light!

The room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

PROFESSOR

Better.. this is the most unbelievable thing

I have ever seen..

The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself

PROFESSOR

(uncomprehending)

...Uh, yes?

The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.

PRIEST

Master... He was about to discover everything,

but I had the situation under control.

The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.

PROFESSOR

(in a panic)

Who are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen

Sie Deutsch?

Billy staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.

The KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.

PRIEST

What did I do wrong?

The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

KOMMANDER

Servant, you and the thousand guards

before you... You have done your work well,

but we have to recover the elements. War will

soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.

PROFESSOR

Unbelievable!!!

The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS

waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway

The Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-

Take them and put them in a safe place.

His men carry out his order.

Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.

The Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious

Will the elements be gone now forever

from this place?

KOMMANDER

When mankind comes to its senses.

We will return.

PRIEST

Knowing mankind as I do, that could take

centuries!

KOMMANDER

Time is of no importance, only life

is important.

The Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

case and looks at the Priest.

KOMMANDER

When EVIL returns so shall we.

We will be ready, Lord.

Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

BILLY

Stop.

Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan

No!!!  Don't!!!

The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy

The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs

through the huge piles of sand.

The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,

The room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried.

The huge ship's main hatch closes.

Don't you have anything?  Not even

CAPTAIN

The thermo-analyzers have jammed.

One of them reads over a million degrees,

the other's at minus 5000...

Never seen anything like it.

TECHNICIAN

It's taking shape.

In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.

CAPTAIN

(in awe)

What the hell can it be?

TECHNICIAN

Hook-up with the president in one

minute, General.

General Staedert remains calm.

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

Staedert, do you read me?

STAEDERT

I can hear you, Mr. President, but I

can't see you .

The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to

His face fills the screen.

PRESIDENT

(exasperated)

Is that better?

STAEDERT

Perfect, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT

I have to address the Supreme Council

in 10 minutes.

Just the facts, General.

STAEDERT

There are no results from the chemical

and molecular analysis as of yet, all the

calibers are overshot..we're hoping a

thermo nucleatic imaging..

PRESIDENT

(exasperated)

What you are saying is you don't know

what this..thing..is.

Consternation reigns in the President's office.

STAEDERT

Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is

it just keeps getting bigger!

PRESIDENT

Options.

STAEDERT

Wait or act.

PRESIDENT

Recommendations.

STAEDERT

My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first

ask questions later.

I don't like uninvited guests.

PRESIDENT

Gentlemen?

HEAD CHEMISTS

I think it would be foolish to shoot at an

organism that seems alive, without first

taking the time to study it more!

Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

PRESIDENT

(worried)

No... it's just getting bigger.

HEAD CHEMISTS

So do people, but that's no reason to shoot

them.

PRESIDENT

(exasperated)

The security of the Federated Territories is

and remains number one priority.

(to the military)

I suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is

acceptable to you?

All the Generals nod "yes"

PRESIDENT

All right, then! Staedert?

PRIEST (O.S.)

Mr. President?

The President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward

...Yes?

The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is

Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.

PRIEST

Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.

I have a different theory to offer you,

Mr. President.

PRESIDENT

I'm listening.

CORNELIUS

Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not

anything that can be identified because it prefers

not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.

Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

PRESIDENT

(a little sarcastically)

One more reason to shoot first eh?

All the Generals nod in agreement.

CORNELIUS

Evil begets evil, Mr. President.

Shooting would only make it stronger.

TECHNICIAN

The probe will attain its objective in

five seconds.

Staedert moves closer to the ship's window.

Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a

STAEDERT

Mr. President, we're at crisis point.

The President looks puzzled.

PRESIDENT

Your theory is interesting Father but

I don't think we have time to go into it

right now!

CORNELIUS

Time is of no importance, Mr. President.

Only life is important.

PRESIDENT

(exasperated)

That's exactly what we are going to try and do:

Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our

fellow citizens! General?

You may fire when ready.

STAEDERT

(cold) (to the CAPTAIN)

..Up front loading of a 120 ZZR missile.

Marker lights on the objective.

All of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases.

SCIENTIST

(consulting new data)

Its structure has just solidified on the surface,

as if the object felt something.  If that's the case,

we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.

CORNELIUS

The most terrible intelligence imaginable,

Mr. President.

The President hesitates.

CAPTAIN

...The ship is in combat formation.

The missile is loaded, General.

PRESIDENT

(uneasy)

Staedert?  Give me a minute...

I have a doubt.

STAEDERT

(cold)

I don't, Mr. President.

The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The

Staedert looks worried.

STAEDERT

Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum

shield protection.

CAPTAIN

Yes, Sir.

The President is growing ever more worried.

PRESIDENT

Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you

destroy it?

STAEDERT

I'm about to, Mr. President.

A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.

SCIENTIST

The planet's diameter has greatly

increased and it's moving toward the ship.

PRESIDENT

Staedert?  Get out of there immediately!

I don't want an incident, do you hear me,

Staedert?

STAEDERT

(worried)

...What do we have that's bigger than 240?

CAPTAIN

Nothing, General.

PRESIDENT

Staedert, get out of there!  That's an order!

A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order

STAEDERT

FINGER (V.O.)

I love you too Major, but you haven't called

me that since basic training.

KORBEN

I was talking to the cat.

FINGER (V.O.)

Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer

your cat to the real thing.

KORBEN

At least, the cat comes back.

FINGER (V.O.)

You still pining for that two timing bitch.

Forget her.

There are a million women out there.

KORBEN

I don't want a million - I just want

one.  A perfect one.

FINGER (V.O.)

Don't exist bud.

...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter.

KORBEN

I just found a picture of you.

FINGER (V.O.)

How do I look?

KORBEN

Like shit.

Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It

I don't need one.

I know how you drive.

KORBEN

Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a

FINGER (V.O.)

How many points you got left on your

KORBEN

Uh... at least fifty.

KORBEN

Cheers!

The office is emptied, only a few army officers remain.  An ancient

point.

CORNELIUS

(to the President)

We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs

to adapt itself to our living conditions.

PRESIDENT

(worried)

And then?

CORNELIUS

And then it will be too late. The goal of

evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life.

For all eternity...Life upsets it.

The President appears upset himself by this image.

PRESIDENT

Is there anything that can stop it?

CORNELIUS

Yes..thank God..

Billy's rendering of the Mondoshawan.

CORNELIUS

(to the President)

The Mondoshawans don't belong to the

Federated Territories, but they are peaceful...

in their possession are the four elements of life.

These elements when they are gathered around a fifth:

The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect

life......

The SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the

..will produce what the ancients called the

light of creation, the light of total goodness

which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element.

PRESIDENT

But what happens if instead of

this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL

who stands here?

CORNELIUS

White turns to black.  Light to Dark.

Life to Death.  For all eternity.

The President's nerves quiver.

CAPTAIN

Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at

the frontier requesting permission to enter

our territory.

PRESIDENT

I guess I should make a decision..

CORNELIUS

They are the only ones who can help..

GENERAL

Sir..the Mondoshawan do not belong to the

federation. We do not know their intention..

I must recommend a full trinuclear assault..

PRESIDENT

(yells)

Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship

like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is!

I ask you for options you give me bullshit.

Give them permission to enter our territories

with my warmest regards.

CORNELIUS

(relieved)

Thank you, Mr. President.

The MONDOSHAWAN spaceship zips across the Federated Galaxy.

But it is not alone: Two black warships seem to be dogging it.

The MONDOSHAWANS have spotted the spacecraft chasing them.

FIRST OFFICER

Two non-identified ships approaching.

CAPTAIN

Must be the welcoming committee.

A MANGALORE sits at the controls of the warship. His terrifying features

The huge ship is badly hit and immediately swerves oft course.

Panic aboard the MONDOSHAWAN ship.

CAPTAIN

We've been hit! General alert!!!

Blast after blast hits the defenseless ship.

CAPTAIN

We're losing control! We have to land fast!

The huge ship veers oft course and heads for a small red planet, taking

CAPTAIN

Send out a distress signal!!! Activate

the emergency landing procedure!

The huge ship approaches the planet at blinding speed.

FIRST OFFICER

Impact in less than ten seconds!

The red planet looms ever closer.

CAPTAIN

Time is of no importance...

The ship crashes in a gigantic explosion.

A thermo nuclear explosion fills a T.V. screen..Which Korben's cat

Korben is about to exit the apartment.

KORBEN

Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your

mind. Bye sweetie..

In response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge

gun, brandished by a nervous MUGGER, pointing right in his face.

MUGGER

The cash man!

KORBEN

Been here long?

MUGGER

Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow

you into tomorrow!

Unperterbed, Korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon.

KORBEN

Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium.

Neuro charged assault model?

MUGGER

(off balance)

Uh..

KORBEN

You know you could hurt someone with

this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

The mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon.

MUGGER

It's not?

KORBEN

You gotta push the little yellow button...

Korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his

MUGGER

Thanks..

KORBEN

You're welcome..

And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right

..you know these things are VERY illegal..

I better hang onto it for you..

As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is

Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches

Korben enters his taxi.  A robotic voice greets him.

VOICE

Please enter your license..

Korben complies, and starts to push a series of buttons on the dash.

VOICE

Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..

KORBEN

How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK?

I didn't.

Korben hits a button.  The garage door starts to open.

VOICE

Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...

KORBEN

I had the worst goddamn nightmare.

VOICE

You have nine points left on your license..

KORBEN

Thanks for reminding me..

As the garage door lifts, the Megalopolis that is New York City in the

Korben lets the propulsion build.

KORBEN

Right..

He lets the gear slip.  The taxi rockets off into the City.

Cornelius collapses in a chair.

CORNELIUS

We are lost!

GENERAL MUNRO

Mr. President, the attack was launched by two

unregistered warships.

PRESIDENT

Close all borders and declare a state of

general alert.

GENERAL MUNRO

Yes, sir.

PRESIDENT

(to another OFFICER)

Try to contact these Mondoshawans.  We

owe them an explanation.

CORNELIUS

(lost, to himself)

What are we going to do?

PRESIDENT

This is government business now.

You ought to go home and get some

rest, Father.

The President motions to his guards to come and get Cornelius.

PRESIDENT

I promise to keep you informed.

A weary Cornelius leaves the room with David's help.

PRESIDENT

(to the CAPTAIN)

...Has the rescue team found any survivors?

An arm, on a surgical cart, moves down the hall of the Nucleological

PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH, age 60, hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO.

MUNRO

This is all that survived?

MACTILBURGH

Actually only one cell survived..

MUNRO

Have you identified it?

MACTILBURGH

It's not that easy..we've never encountered

anything like it before..you see normal human

beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is

more than enough for any species to perpetuate

itself..This one has 200,000.

MUNRO

Talk English Doc.

MACTILBURGH

This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite

genetic knowledge stored inside.

Almost like it was...engineered.

MUNRO

Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

MACTILBURGH

Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

They pass into the lab.

The two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in

MACTILBURGH

(rather fascinated)

The compositional elements of his DNA

chain are the same as ours, there are simply

more of them tightly packed.

His knowledge is probably limitless..

MUNRO

(worried)

Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

MACTILBURGH

We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.

The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

Munro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to

self-destruct box.

MUNRO

OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...

otherwise I turn him into cat food.

Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the

DOCTOR

Three seconds to ultra-violet protection.

A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.

MACTILBURGH

(to Munro)

...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction

of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly

greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells

to react, to protect themselves.

That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

MUNRO

(disgusted)

Wonderful!

The meter slows, drops to zero.

ASSISTANT

reanimation .

The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly

MACTILBURGH

Activate the phonic detector.

The girl kicks the window repeatedly.

MACTILBURGH

And give her a light sedative...

and something to wear!

The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor

MUNRO

This thing solid?

MACTILBURGH

An elephant couldn't crack it.

The Girl finishes dressing.

Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.

Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The

A police car with wailing sirens halts in front of Korben.

Please leave your hands on the wheel.

Thank you for your cooperation.

KORBEN

That's me.  But I don't know who she is...

where did you find her?

KORBEN

She dropped in on me... holding this.

Korben hands him the metal handle with the three Egyptian suns, stamped

CORNELIUS

(staggered)

The fifth element.

He faints dead away.  Korben, with the girl still in his arms looks

KORBEN

(sighing)

Finger's gonna kill me...

In his armchair, Cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face.

CORNELIUS

(with a start)

Who are you?

KORBEN

I brought the girl remember?

CORNELIUS

The girl?

Cornalius gets up.  He looks at the handle.

KORBEN

Yeah! She dropped in on me. I mean

on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre

language...

And then it dawns on Cornelius who the girl is.

CORNELIUS

(eyes riveted on her)

He's a she!

KORBEN

(bemused)

You noticed...

CORNELIUS

(face shining)

There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up,

but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's

most precious possession! She is... perfect!

KORBEN

So you do know her.

CORNELIUS

Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

Cornelius runs into the next room.  Korben looks at the girl, goes to

Her beauty troubles him.  He hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek.

KORBEN

Perfect...

David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of

CORNELIUS

It's a miracle!!!

DAVID

(worried)

What is?

CORNELIUS

(babbling crazily)

I can't wear these clothes! This calls

for dignity!

I have to dress the part!

He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in,

Korben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond.  He

GIRL

(angry)

Eto Akta Gamat!

KORBEN

(embarrassed)

I'm sorry, it's just that... I was

told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

The girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled.

KORBEN

You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't

have kissed you... especially since we

haven't been introduced and...

(he pulls out a business card)

Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is

Korben, Korben Dallas.

Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll

need a cab one day.  I'll be happy to open

the door this time!.

The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal.

Cornelius is lost in the closet.

DAVID

Father, will you please explain what's

going on?

CORNELIUS

The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here,

in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!

KORBEN

...What's your name?

GIRL

(after a moment)

Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai

Ekbat De Sebat.

KORBEN

(polite)

Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname,

something a little... shorter?

GIRL

...Leeloo.

Korben is falling in love.

KORBEN

That's... really cute...

Cornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him.

He bows before her.

CORNELIUS

Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

LEELOO

Corn-i-Lius?

CORNELIUS

(bowing)

At your service.

LEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh.

Korben smiles.

DAVID

Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

CORNELIUS

Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on

her gloves!

David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to

KORBEN

They all like this in your family, father?

CORNELIUS

She's an exception..

CORNELIUS

Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

KORBEN

Dallas. Korben Dallas.

Cornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben

CORNELIUS

Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much.

A thousand times over!

KORBEN

I might call to check up on her,

you know... to see if she's better?

CORNELIUS

She's fine, really..don't you worry..

just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

KORBEN

I know. I was there when she arrived.

Cornelius is about to close the door.  Korben's hand blocks it.

KORBEN

Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something

to me a while ago and... I don't really get it...

Akta Gamat?

CORNELIUS

It means, "Never without my permission".

KORBEN

That's what I thought.

Cornelius slams the door in his face.

KORBEN

...Thanks.

Korben beads down the hallway. He passes his NEIGHBOR.

KORBEN

Evening...

NEIGHBOR

Fuck you!

KORBEN

...Thanks... You, too.

Korben enters his-apartment.

The door slides back and the cat comes rubbing up against him, tail in

KORBEN

Oh god. I forgot your food ... I'm really sorry!

How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize?

How does that sound, huh?

The cat meows, appeased, just an the phone rings.

KORBEN

Hello?

FINGER (V.O.)

Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

KORBEN

Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way

over but I had a fare fall into my lap..

y'know one of those big fares you just

can't resist..

FINGER (V.O.)

(suspicious)

So, just how big was this fare?

KORBEN

5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin...

perfect..

Korben takes out a cigarette.

FINGER (V.O.)

Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the

name of this..perfect fare..

KORBEN

(dreamy)

Leeloo..

Leeloo has a towel wrapped around her, it looks like she just took a

DAVID

What's she doing?

CORNELIUS

Learning our history!

The last 5000 years that she missed!

She's been out of circulation a while,

you know.

Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter.

CORNELIUS

What're you laughing about?

LEELOO

(pronouncing badly)

Napoleon... small.

She laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave.

DAVID

(hesitant)

Uh father, I know she's been through a lot...

but the sacred stones..we don't have much

time..

CORNELIUS

Yes. Of course..

Leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave.  A steaming plate heaped

CORNELIUS

Leeloo..I'm sorry to interrupt you but..

She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her

CORNELIUS

(serious)

The case..with the stones...

Where is it?

LEELOO

San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

CORNELIUS

The case was stolen?

Leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food

CORNELIUS

(shocked)

Who in gods name would do such

a thing?

CLOSE ON: A pair of feet limping heavily.  A MAN comes alongside them.

RIGHT ARM

Excuse me sir, the council is worried about

the economy heating up.  They wondered if

it would be possible to fire 500...

They reach a door at the end of the corridor.  Zorg enters a code.

ZORG

Fire 1000.

RIGHT ARM

But... 500 is all they need, sir.

ZORG turns slowly.  A small scar across run across his face, his eye

This is not a man to cross, or contradict.

RIGHT ARM

1000! Fine, sir!

Sorry to have disturbed you.

The door opens...

... and David enters carrying a bundle of clothes.

CORNELIUS

There was this guy with a limp who

came a month ago..said he was an art

dealer ... Asking all these questions about

the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think

anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so

bad with names...

DAVID

(to Leeloo, timid)

I didn't know your size.

Leeloo is happy. She pulls off the towel and stands there nude. Cornelius

DAVID

They really made her...

CORNELIUS

Perfect.

Leeloo finishes dressing. She is delighted.

LEELOO

(to David)

Domo danko!

David smiles, dumb with admiration.  Cornelius comes over.

CORNELIUS

Leeloo?  The Stones...

We must get them back.

Leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on.

LEELOO

Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

CORNELIUS

You know exactly where they are!

A group of handsome WARRIORS approaches.  AKNOT, their leader has the

ZORG

(pretending to be worried)

Aknot?  Is that you?

The LEADER nods. A disgusted look stamps Zorg's features.

ZORG

...What an ugly face! Doesn't suit you at all!

Take it off...

AKNOT's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous MANGALORE.

ZORG

That's better! Never be ashamed of

who you are...

You're warriors... be proud...

AKNOT says nothing, but if his eyes could talk!

ZORG

So what if the Federal Army crushed your

entire race and scattered your people to the

wind...

Your time for revenge is at hand...

Voila... the ZF1.

He takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch.

ZORG

(very fast)

...It's light... the handle's adjustable for

easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.

Meanwhile, two MEN set up a mannequin rigged with various defense

ZORG

... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by

X-rays.. It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet

interventions.  A word on fire power: Titanium

recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300.

With the replay button, another Zorg innovation,

it's even easier... one shot.

He fires at the mannequin.

ZORG

... and replay sends every following shot

to the same location...

Zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin.

ZORG

(even faster)

I recharge, but the enemy has launched a

cowardly sneak attack from behind, the

automirror takes care of that.  Gives me the

time to turn around and finish the job.

300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies...

He fires off each item he names.

ZORG

...Rocket launcher.  The always efficient

flame thrower... My favorite.

Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher,

with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very

practical.

And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube

system!

The mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,.

ZORG

...Four full crates, delivered right on time!

What about you, my dear Aknot, did

you bring me what I asked you for?

AKNOT sets the case on a crate.  Zorg gloats while stroking the case.

ZORG

...Magnificent.

Zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case.  It's empty

Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again.

CORNELIUS

(astonished)

What do you mean empty?

AKNOT looks into the case.  Things grow tense.

ZORG

Alright..I've got an open mind here..

anyone care to explain?

Leeloo explains what happened in her language.

CORNELIUS

(translating)

She says that the Guardians never really had

much faith in humans. They were afraid of

being attacked. The stones were given to someone

they could trust who took another route.

She's supposed to contact this person in a little less

than twelve hours from now in a hotel.

She's looking for the address!

A map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points.

LEELOO

Dot!

The little group comes over to look.

DAVID

Planet Fhloston, in the Angel constellation

Cornelius plops down into his armchair.

CORNELIUS

...We're saved!

ZORG

I'm fucked!

Zorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare.

AKNOT

You asked for a case.

We brought you a case.

ZORG

(shouting)

A case with four stones in it. Not one!

Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!!

What the fuck am I supposed to do with an

EMPTY case?!!

AKNOT

(tense)

...We are warriors, not merchants!

ZORG

(humored)

But you can still count.  Look...

my fingers.

He holds up four fingers.

ZORG

...Four stones, four crates... Zero stones...

(yelling)

ZERO CRATES!!!

(to his men)

Put everything back, we're outta here.

AKNOT's warriors turn their weapons on Zorg.

AKNOT

(icily)

We risked our lives. I believe a

little compensation is in order.

ZORG

(smiling)

So, you are a merchant, after all.

(to his men)

Leave them one crate.  For the cause!

Zorg's men leave a crate and exit with the other three.

Zorg walks along the street to his limo.  RIGHT ARM carries the empty

ZORG

I don't like warriors!  They're too

narrow-minded, no sublety.  Worse,

they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!

Honor has killed millions of people but

hasn't saved a single one.

(pause)

You know what -- do I like though, I like killer.

A real dyed in the wool killer.  Cold-blooded.

Clean.  Methodical.  Thorough.  A killer, when

he picked up the ZF1, would've immediately

asked about the little red button on the bottom of

the gun.

The warriors have all taken a weapon. One of them inspects his ZF1.  He

Behind Zorg, an ear-shattering explosion levels the warehouse.

ZORG

(impassive)

Bring the priest.

Korben is finishing a Thai meal, cooked by a Thai on his mini restaurant

KORBEN

So you forgive me?

The cat meows just as a red light blinks, announcing the arrival of a

THAI

Not going to open?

KORBEN

I've never gotten a message that wasn't

bad news.

THAI

How someone strong like you scared from

a message? Is good news I sure!

KORBEN

The last two messages I got?  The first one

was from my wife telling me she was leaving!

And the second was from my lawyer telling me

he was leaving too... with my wife.

THAI

You right that is bad.. but mathematically

luck must change!

Grandfather say: "It never rain every day."

This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!

Korben hesitates, then gives the envelope to the Thai, who opens it with

THAI

...You're fired. Oh!

Korben smiles at him.

KORBEN

At least I won lunch.

THAI

Good philosophy..see good in bad..

I like..I prepare number one dessert..

special for you and pussy..

The cat meows.

Leeloo is polishing of' an immense pile of dessert as David bangs away at

DAVID

I got it!  Everything  here we need to

know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel...

and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!

CORNELIUS

Good work, my son.  Now all we need is

a way to get there.

The doorbell rings.

CORNELIUS

I'll get it.  Finish your work my son.

Cornelius opens to Right Arm with armed escort.

RIGHT ARM

Father Cornelius?

CORNELIUS

My son?

RIGHT ARM

Mr. Zorg would like a word with you.

CORNELIUS

Mr. Who?

Zorg turns to Cornelius.

ZORG

Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg...

nice to see you again

CORNELIUS

I remember you now..the so called

art dealer.

ZORG

I'm glad you got your memory back, Father...

Because you're going to need it...

Where are the stones?

CORNELIUS

...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

ZORG

Personally, they are of no interest to me,

I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer...

so tell me...

CORNELIUS

Even it I did know where the stones were

I would never tell somebody like you.

ZORG

Why?  What's wrong with me?

CORNELIUS

...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life,

All you want to do is destroy it.

ZORG

Ah, Father... You are so wrong.

Let me explain...

Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office.

ZORG

...would you like a drink?

CORNELIUS

No thank you.

ZORG

Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve,

comes from destruction. Look at this empty

glass.

Zorg pushes the glass with his finger.

ZORG

Here it is... peaceful... serene...

but if it is...

Zorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor.

ZORG

Destroyed...

Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping

ZORG

...Look at all these little things...

so busy all of a sudden.

Notice how each one is useful.

What a lovely ballet, so full of form

and color.  So full of..life!

CORNELIUS

They are robots!

A SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry

ZORG

Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction.

I gave work to at least fifty people today. The

engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty

people who will be able to feed their children so

they can grow up big and strong.  Children who

will have children of their own, adding to the great

cycle of life!

Cornelius sits in silence.

ZORG

Father, by creating a little destruction,

I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in

reality, you and I are in the same business!

CORNELIUS

Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people

with the weapons you produce is quite another.

ZORG

Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill

more people in my entire life than religion has

killed in the last 2000 years.

Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.

Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts

CORNELIUS

(mocking)

Where's the robot to pat your back?

Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which

CORNELIUS

Can I give you a hand?

Cornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg

ZORG

You saved my life... So, I'm going

to spare yours.

(to the GUARDS)

Throw him out!

The GUARDS throw Cornelius out.

CORNELIUS

You are a monster, Zorg!

ZORG

(complimented)

I know...

The GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office.

ZORG

...Torture whoever you want, the

president if you have to but I want

those Stones. You have an hour.

Right Arm salutes and hurries out of the office.

...The dark planet. Three warships are positioned in front of it.

Communication satellites arrive from all over the place, drawn to it like

CAPTAIN

(observing)

It's gobbling up all the communication

satellites in the galaxy!

President Lindberg appears even more crushed by recent events.

PRESIDENT

Why the hell is it eating up all those

satellites like that?

HEAD SCIENTIST

(desperate)

...We're working on it, Mr. President.

We're working on it.

PRESIDENT

It should only choke on them.

MUNRO enters the office just as a cockroach crawls onto the desk.

Zorg's Right Arm wears earphones, monitoring the President's conversation

MUNRO

I managed to contact the Mondoshawan.

They deplore the incident, but accept our

apologies.

PRESIDENT

(relieved)

And the Stones?  Did you find them in the

wreckage?

MUNRO

The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.

PRESIDENT

(surprised)

...What do you mean?

The President is all ears.

So is Zorg's Right Arm.

MUNRO

The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the

human race..they felt we're too unpredictable..

so they gave up the Stones to somebody they

do trust. Her name is Plavalaguna. She's a Diva

and she's going to sing at the charity ball on

Fhloston Paradise in a few hours.  She has the

Stones with her.

The President breathes easier.

Zorg's Right Arm is delighted.

PRESIDENT

(taking off a shoe)

Excellent!

The President crushes the cockroach with his shoe.

Right Arm's earphones fly off his head. Good-bye eardrums.

PRESIDENT

I want your best man on this!

MUNRO

Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.

C.U. The most disgusting dessert ever made.  Korben looks at it shimmying

THAI

Stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..

Korben forces a weak, polite smile as the Thai looks on expectantly.  The

KORBEN

Saved by the bell.

Korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone.

KORBEN

...Hello?

MOTHER (V.O.)

You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in

this stinking City!

KORBEN

(resigned)

Hi Ma...

MOTHER (V.O.)

I've been playing twice a week for 20 years,

20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

Korben goes to light his cigarette.  There are only two matches left in

Korben strikes one and it fizzles.

MOTHER (V.O.)

You wouldn't even eat one to help your

poor mother, and you win the big prize?

Know something? The whole thing makes

me sick!

The Thai starts to clean up.  Just as Korben goes to strike the second

MOTHER (V.O.)

Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

KORBEN

(resigned)

Yes ma..

Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box.

Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding.

KORBEN

(to the Thai)

Go on... This is gonna take a while!

KORBEN

Other than that... You all right?

MOTHER (V.O.)

...And now you're making fun of me?

I'm warning you! If you don't take me

after all these years of sacrifice, I'll

never forgive you!!

The Thai flies off.  In the hall, the cat meows-for more food.

KORBEN

(to the cat)

I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking

about?

MOTHER (V.O.)

I get it! You want to make me beg,

is that it?

KORBEN

All I want is an explanation! I just got

in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab.

I got mugged, but other than that

everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!!

Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on.

MOTHER (V.O.)

You just won a trip, you dolt!

Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

KORBEN

Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it.

Someone would have notified me.

MOTHER (V.O.)

They've been blaring out your name on

the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.-

KORBEN

Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back.

Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the

MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.

Munro opens a file.

MUNRO

(clipped)

Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct

you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal

Army on your enlistment which is more than

you will need for a mission of the utmost

importance.

KORBEN

What mission?

MUNRO

To save the world.

KORBEN

Where have I heard this song before?

MUNRO

You're to leave immediately for Fhloston

Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the

Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with

the utmost discretion as possible.

Any questions'?

KORBEN

(a little bewildered)

Just one... why me?

MUNRO

Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite

Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army

you are an expert in the use of all weapons

and spacecraft needed for this mission.

Munro pulls out a long list of documents.

MUNRO

Two: Of all the members of your unit

you were the most highly decorated.

KORBEN

And the third one?

MUNRO

You're the only one left alive...

Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at.

MUNRO

Don't you open your messages?

KORBEN

I've had enough good news for today

MUNRO

(by rote)

You have won the annual Gemini contest

and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two.

Congratulations.

Here are your tickets.

He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it.

KORBEN

You rigged the contest?

Munro nods.

MUNRO

Major Iceborg will accompany you...

as your wife...

The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick.

KORBEN

(sarcastic)

You couldn't come up with something

a little more discreet?

MUNRO

Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

KORBEN

I'm not going.

MUNRO

Why not?

KORBEN

One reason... I want to stay the only

one left alive.

Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the

The doorbell rings.

KORBEN

...Scuse me.

Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo.

Korben panics, overcome with happiness.

KORBEN

...Shit!

MUNRO

(worried)

What is it?

Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro.

KORBEN

It's my wife.

MUNRO

I thought you were divorced.

KORBEN

I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex..

if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates

you guys. It's what killed us in the first place.

Please...

He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's

KORBEN

...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice!

It'll only take a minute! Let me set up

another meeting and I'll be back.

MUNRO

Three of us will never fit in there!

KORBEN

(pushing him)

Oh, yes you will...

Korben slams the fridge door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

KORBEN

...Coming!

He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying

shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his

and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between

eyes held by Cornelius.

LEELOO

Apipoulai!

KORBEN

I suppose that means "Hi" ?

CORNELIUS

I'm sorry to have to resort to such

methods, but we heard about your

good luck on he radio and we need

the tickets to Fhloston.

KORBEN

Is that the usual way priests go on

vacation?

CORNELIUS

We're not going on vacation..we're

on a mission..

KORBEN

What kind of mission?

CORNELIUS

(sincere)

We have to save the world.

KORBEN

(skeptical)

Good luck..

CORNELIUS

Of course.

KORBEN

Father, I was in the Army for awhile

and every time they told us we were

on a mission to save the world the

only thing that changed was I lost a

lot of friends. So thanks for the offer..

but no thanks.

Cornelius is disappointed.  Leeloo looks crestfallen.

KORBEN

I'm sorry..

VOICE

This is a police control action..

Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic

A group of POLICEMEN bursts into the hallway.  One of the cops enters a

a VOICE fills the air.

VOICE

This is not an exercise.

This is a police control.

Cornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge.

CORNELIUS

Oh my god oh my god..

Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower

KORBEN

Leeloo, hide in here and don't move!

Leeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed.

CORNELIUS

What are you doing?

KORBEN

Trying to save your ass so you can

save the world.

..and hits a button on the wall.  The bed disappears into the wall.

Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt.

Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues.

VOICE

...Spread your legs and place your

hands in the yellow circles, please.

A COP slaps a viewer device on Korben's door which makes part of it

COP 1

Put your hands in the yellow circles,

please.

Korben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He's

a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair

COP 1

(to COP 2)

Sir? Are you a human?

KORBEN

No, I'm a meat popsicle.

COP 3

(at the other end of the hall)

I found him!

C.U. Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the

COP 1

Sir, this is a control.  Please put your

hands in the yellow circles.

The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He

NEIGHBOR

Fuck you!!

Korben still has his hands to the wall.

KORBEN

Wrong answer.

SHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle.

The riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in

COP

OK, we got the guy under wraps.

Right Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg.

COP (O.S.)

It was not easy, but we bagged him!.

Thanks for the tip!

RIGHT ARM

(smiling)

Glad to help.

He hangs up.

RIGHT ARM

They just arrested the guy for Uranium

smuggling. Everything's going as planned.

He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's

RIGHT ARM

All I have to do now is to go to the

airport and take his place.  I should be

in Fhloston in less than four hours.

Zorg sits there quietly for a moment.

ZORG

Don't come back without the Stones.

Korben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth

KORBEN

I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.

KORBEN

Here let me wrap you up.

Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo

KORBEN

..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and

you've ended up in my arms both times.

Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.

She recovers, looking embarrassed too.

LEELOO

(nicely)

Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

KORBEN

Uh..you're welcome.

The intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion.

KORBEN

Coffee!  That's what you need!

A nice, hot cup of coffee!

He pushes a button on the coffee machine.

KORBEN

With some honey!  You'll see, honey's

great!...

Korben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to

KORBEN

A hot cup of coffee... with honey...

He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and

KORBEN

(nervously)

I've got this great honey somewhere.

You know about honey?  There used to be

these little animals who made it with antenna...

..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero.

KORBEN

..and these other animals who ate it..

one were bees the other were bears..

She looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

KORBEN

I forget which ate it and which made it

but..

And she smiles.

KORBEN

Here it is!

Korben holds up the jar of honey.

KORBEN

Taste this...

Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

KORBEN

It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her

An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with

KORBEN

You hear that?

LEELOO

(licking)

Cornelius..

KORBEN

Oh god!

Korben pushes the button on the wall.  The bed pops out, fully made, with

KORBEN

I'm really sorry.. let me help you..

LEELOO

Achta ge lumitai de matala..

Korben turns..

KORBEN

What?

He turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. His breath is taken

Cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  Korben drops to

LEELOO

(displeased)

Vano da, mechteba?!

Soun domo kala chon hammas!

CORNELIUS

No, I'm not proud of myself...

But we don't have the luxury of choice.

The POLICE exit the elevator and head for the front door.  A cop suddenly

Aknot, the Mangalore leader, is seriously wounded and can't walk.

AKANIT

Korben Dallas!  We got him.

AKNOT

Perfect... Take command, Akanit.

Go to Fhloston and get the Stones...

If Zorg really wants them... He'll have

to negotiate.  Revenge is at hand.

Korben gets unsteadily to his feet, some blood drips down his face. He

KORBEN

Jesus!... Some priest!

The phone rings, he manages to answer.

KORBEN

Yeah?

MOTHER (V.O)

Have you pulled yourself together?

KORBEN

...Not yet.

He hangs up.

Korben opens the fridge door.  The three officers are frozen solid.

KORBEN

I'll take the mission.

He closes the door.

Cornelius and Leeloo (still damp) arrive at the Manhattan Intergalactic

A huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

There are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash

SECURITY GUARD

Illegal gathering in Zone 4.

A hand taps Leeloo from behind.  She whips around catching David in the

CORNELIUS

Leeloo, be careful.

He turns to David who in holding his bloody nose.

CORNELIUS

Did you get them?

David hands Cornelius two passports.

CORNELIUS

Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.

He hands it to her.  The name makes her smile.

CORNELIUS

And Korben David Dallas.

She frowns.

LEELOO

Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

CORNELIUS

I can't pretend to be your husband...

David's in great shape.

She looks at David holding his bloody nose.

CORNELIUS

He'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva...

get the Stones... See you at the temple...

God be with you.

ANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he

David nervously puts tickets and IDs on the check-in counter.

Leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt.

CHECK-IN ATTENDANT

Congratulations on winning the contest.

David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes.

Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for

KORBEN

(friendly)

Hey! I really thought I was going to

miss my flight!

(to David)

Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on

the conveyor belt?

DAVID

(freaking)

Uh... yeah.

KORBEN

(smiling)

Great! Now beat it!

Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant.

KORBEN

Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the

flight that I sent the kid here to pick up

my boarding card.

He looks at David's fake ID.

KORBEN

...My cousin David...

Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile.

CHECK-IN ATTENDANT

(looking at Leeloo's ID)

Your wife?

Korben grabs the ID and reads it.

KORBEN

Uh, yes... Newlyweds.

(aside)

You know how it is... Love at first sight.

You meet, something goes tilt,. you get

married, you hardly know each other.

Right, darling?

Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand.

LEELOO

(sharply)

Dinoine chagantakat!

KORBEN

Took the words right out of my mouth.

Go on... I'll be right with you.

(to Check-in Attendant)

It's our honeymoon. We're going to use

the trip to get to know each other better.

He winks at the stewardess.

ANGLE ON:

The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in

COP

(to pig)

Come on, snyffer, go root!

The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack.

Cornelius sits at a bar.

CORNELIUS

(to the bartender)

I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty

work. I know she was made to be strong

but she's also so fragile... So human.

You know what I mean?

The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink.

ANGLE ON:

The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in

CHECK-IN ATTENDANT

(surprised)

Dallas... Korben...

NEIGHBOR

(in a different voice)

Yes, that's me.

The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on

Mangalores.

CHECK-IN ATTENDANT

(smiling)

Just a minute, please.

She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong.

NEIGHBOR

We'll be right back ... we're gonna

check out the duty free...

They spin around and hurry away.

ANGLE ON:

Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag.

ROBOT

The same?

CORNELIUS

Yeah...

DAVID (V.O.)

Make that two...

Cornelius turns to David.

CORNELIUS

Where's Leeloo?

DAVID

On the plane... with Mr. Dallas...

the real one.

CORNELIUS

It's all my fault.  I'm the servant...

It's my mission! Here!

He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck.

CORNELIUS

Here's the key to the Temple..

Prepare for our arrival!

Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot,

A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them.

NEIGHBOR

(to the tawdry girl)

Tell Aknot plan A flopped.

Tell him to go to plan B.

The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and

COP

(into walkie-talkie)

...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7!

ANGLE ON:

On one side of the hall, a trap door opens. Three pigs come running out,

Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and

Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything

Korben is led down the hall by a STEWARDESS.

STEWARDESS

You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the

coolest DJ in the universe.

KORBEN

Listen... I don't want to be interviewed.

I'd prefer to remain anonymous.

The stewardess stops in the corridor.

STEWARDESS

Forget anonymous.  You'll be doing Loc

Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!

KORBEN

(expression changes)

You gotta be kidding!

The stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  The door next to him suddenly

In walks LOC RHOD amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  He is

LOC RHOD

(speedy, in rhythm)

Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated

man in the universe. The one and only winner

of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start

melting 'cause the boy's hot! Hot! Hot! The boy

is perfect..

(he feels his muscles)

...The right size, right build, right hair.  Right on!

Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out

there D-man!

An ASSISTANT hands a totally lost Korben a mike.

KORBEN

(hesitant)

...Hi.

LOC RHOD

Does it get any better or what!

Loc Rhod grabs Korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as

LOC RHOD

...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on

fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know

everything there is to know about the D-man.

His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of

intimates.  And from what I'm looking at

intimate is the stud muffin's middle name.

So tell me my main man... you nervous in the

service?

KORBEN

Uh... not really.

Loc Rhod lets go of Korben's arm and grabs the Stewardess.

LOC RHOD

Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause

Korben is on the case with a major face...

Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess.

LOC RHOD

...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a

sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your

every desire.

They come to an intersection.  The airline company has prepared drinks

LOC RHOD

Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince

of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and

one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  A magic

fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and

Bootchie Koochie Koo...

He tosses away his champagne glass.

LOC RHOD

Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on

the prowl. Owwww!

Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm.

LOC RHOD

...And start licking your stamps little girls,

this guy's gonna have you writing home to

Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I'll be your

voice, your tongue and I'll be hot on the tail

of the sexiest man of the year... D-man...

Your man... My man.

The stewardess shivers.  A BEEP is heard.

VOCODER (O.S.)

End of transmission.

The MUSIC suddenly stops.  Several assistants come and compliment Loc

LOC RHOD

Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this

is probably the biggest thing that ever happened

to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got

a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow,

when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make

believe you have more than a one word vocabulary.

OK pal?

That does it.  Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a

Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground.

KORBEN

(pissed)

I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio.

So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a

hand, that clear pal?

LOC RHOD

(petrified)

Crystal.

The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand.

CHECK-IN ATTENDANT

(alter a moment, reading)

...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas?

Zorg's Right Arm gives her a big smile.

RIGHT ARM

That's right.

The attendant scans the ID with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the

CHECK-IN ATTENDANT

The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on

my list... and he's already checked in.

Right Arm's smile shatters.

RIGHT ARM

That's impossible!  He's in j... I mean, there

must be some mistake. I have my ticket!

I'm the real Korben Dallas!

A shrill BELL rings out.

CHECK-IN ATTENDANT

(smiling)

I'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished.

The attendant hits a button.  A thick window slowly slides up between

Right Arm totally loses it.

RIGHT ARM

I want to see your boss!  Get rid of this

fucking window! Somebody's made a

mistake, goddamnit!

He pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down.

VOICE (O.S.)

This is not an exercise.  This is a police

control.

Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...

RIGHT ARM

(slowing down)

Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited...

that's all... I'm calm now.

Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in

LEELOO

Apipoulai!

KORBEN

Not hard to find you...just follow the

Chaos...

Leeloo smiles, as if complimented.

KORBEN

Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets...

they're not mine... I mean they are, but

not for vacation like everyone thinks...

I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come

get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble...

I'd love to be on vacation with you...

but now.... now I've got to work...

And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.

Leeloo types in "LOVE" on the keyboard.

LEELOO

Love...

KORBEN

Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word

here, PEACE is!

Leeloo types in this new word.

LEELOO

(rather pleased)

Peace... and love...

She brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign.

KORBEN

Sometimes you can't learn everything

from a screen..sometimes it's better to

ask someone who has experience..

LEELOO

(quite happy)

What is... Make Love?

Korben just stares at her for a few minutes.

KORBEN

Know what? On that subject maybe you'd

be better off asking the screen.

He turns the computer back on.

ANGLE ON:

A STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on

VOICE (O.S.)

...to make your flight as short and agreeable

as possible, our flight attendants are switching

on the timing sleeper which will regulate your

sleep during the trip...

ANGLE ON:

LEELOO

(switching off the screen)

OK! Finished!

KORBEN

Finished what?

LEELOO

Learning language.

KORBEN

Which one?

LEELOO

All 900.

Korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not.

KORBEN

You learned 900 languages in five

minutes?!

LEELOO

(pleased)

Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your

language, you have to learn mine!

KORBEN

I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how

to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.

LEELOO

Apipoussan!

KORBEN

Apipoussan?

LEELOO

Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?

KORBEN

(fumbling)

Uh...

LEELOO

...Hoppi-hoppa.

Korben literally melts.

KORBEN

(to himself)

Help...

Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window.

STEWARDESS

Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas!

The stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately

A STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem.

STEWARDESS 2

Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume

your individual position.

LOC RHOD

(hugging her)

I don't want an individual position,

I want all positions!

STEWARDESS 2

(resisting somewhat)

We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod!

LOC RHOD

Now you're talking!

Three CREW MEMBERS prepare for liftoff.

COPILOT

Stewardess 1 enters the cockpit.

RIGHT ARM

He is already sweating.

ZORG

(cold)

I'm listening.

RIGHT ARM

The real Korben Dallas is on the plane!

He took my place.

ZORG

This is a joke, right?

Loc Rhod is wrapped around a stewardess like a snake.

LOC RHOD

No!! I swear to God! I've never been this

sincere with a human before!

TWO GROUND CREW MEMBERS stick an enormous, highly phosphorescant tube

into the opening.

GROUND CREW MEMBER

You're fueled and ready to go.

Have a nice flight.

PILOT

(to copilot)

Everything ready for liftoff?

STEWARDESS

(weakly, to Loc Rhod)

No, no... I'm not ready! I'd like to talk first...

ZORG

I cannot hear you. We have a bad

connection here.  What's your number?

Right Arm reads off the phone number.

RIGHT ARM

278-500-645-321

ZORG

I'll call you back.

The runway is now empty. A man slips out of the shadows. It's Cornelius.

The pilots are going through the pre-flight check list.

The mechanic presses a series of buttons.

Loc Rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess' blouse, behind a

In the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up.

ZORG

My costs have tripled.

Shadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the

Money is of no importance...

I want the Stones!

The black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt.  Zorg

Zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked.

Stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one. They

Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right,

man. Tell me all about yourself, your

roots, your personal life, your childhood

dreams...

KORBEN

I don't think this is a good time...

LOC RHOD

...You got brothers and sisters? What

about your dad? Tell me about your

dad! What was he like? Physically?

Big, I suppose?

KORBEN

Yeah, very big, a giant.

LOC RHOD

I didn't have a dad... never saw him...

never even heard him. 50 billion people

The hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row.

HOSTESS

Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after

the concert to open it.

She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door.

Korben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular

Hello?

MOTHER (O.S.)

You little sleaze bag!

KORBEN

...Ma???

MOTHER (O.S.)

Don't you ever ask me for another thing

in my life again, you've killed your

poor mother with your own hands!

Korben drops into an armchair and sighs. His eyes go to the ceiling.

KORBEN

...Ma!!!

The Chief of Police has Cornelius in front of him, handcuffed.

FOG

The Diva's ship is coming in.

CHIEF OF POLICE

I want maximum security.

FOG

Yes. Sir!

CHIEF OF POLICE

(to Cornelius)

OK, let's hear it.

CORNELIUS

Where was I?

CHIEF OF POLICE

(bored)

...You open the door. There's a cabby with

a girl in his arms.

FOG opens the door.  Two COPS come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged.

CHIEF OF POLICE

What happened?

A bomb go off in your face?

BEAT-UP COP

Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb...

with green eyes.

Cornelius perks up.

CORNELIUS

And the smile of an angel?

They all turn to look at him.

CORNELIUS

(to Chief)

May I speak to you alone.

Leeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear

PORTERS carrying trunks.

Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a

DIVA'S ASSISTANT

Please forgive this little incident. She wants

you to know that she senses great powers in

you... in the service of a noble cause... She

will give you what you have come to get, but

she wants to sing first...

One last time...

The Diva's assistant turns the painting right side up.

DIVA'S ASSISTANT

(nodding)

Miss.

Leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better.

Policemen stand at attention in front of the Diva's suite.

FOG

Hello, I'm head of security.

Everything is in order. You can...

The Diva enters her suite without letting him finish.

FOG

...make yourselves at home safely.

If you need anything...give it a knock!

A door opens near the police officer's main entrance. Cornelius looks

Korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone.

KORBEN

Listen, Ma! I've only got a few days

vacation and I'll be damned if I'm

gonna spend them on the phone.

The door RINGS.

KORBEN

...Hang on, it's the door. No!

I told you I didn't bring anybody!

I'm all alone... as usual!

Korben opens the door.  It's not the champagne.  Even better. It's

Leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  Korben has to

Here we go again...

LEELOO

You know women normally change five

times more than men.

KORBEN

You get that off the screen?

LEELOO

Yes... you know there's a lot of

differences between men women.

KORBEN

You noticed..

LEELOO

OK, you can turn around!

Korben turns around.  Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy

KORBEN

Where you going?

LEELOO

I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's

the matter?... Do I look bad?

KORBEN

No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite,

you're... you're beautiful!

Leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  She turns, revealing

LEELOO

Do you know how this works?

Korben's blood boils.  She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to

I have an idea.

But instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  A

Stunned, Leeloo is held captive.

KORBEN

I told you I need to work in peace.

Remember? I need to concentrate.

LEELOO

And you can't concentrate with me

around?.

KORBEN

It's difficult.

She tries to breakout.

KORBEN

Army issue. I'm sorry.

Leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. Impossible.

Korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.

Leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.

LEELOO

(seething)

You're nothing but a... a...

KORBEN

The words you're looking for weren't

The door flies open.  Loc Rhod barges in.

Then he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  His mind goes

Korben my man what's happening here?

Who's the chick? What's the gig?

We free forming here? Getting funky

with the monkey? Can I get in on this?

Korben grabs him by the collar..

No..to all of the above.

And yanks Loc Rhod out of the room.  Leaving Leeloo looking extremely

We have just walked into what is probably

the most beautiful concert hall in the universe.

Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the

ceiling. I don't know who painted them, but he

must have busted his balls! I see a row of former

ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals

practicing how to sleep. And there's Baby Ray, star

of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets.

He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's

stone-deaf!

ANGLE ON:

Baby Ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph.

BABY RAY

...to who?

(moving down the aisle)

...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king

of laserball and the best paid player in the League.

...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet

whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar.

recently confessed to me. She will no doubt

prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.

It's showtime!

The lights dim slowly in the concert hall.

President Lindbergh and his staff, including Munro, sit at the desk.

Leeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert.

Korben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown,

Leeloo has tears in her eyes

The manager couldn't care less about the concert.  His main problem is

She's allergic to flowers!!!

There's champagne as well...

The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And

ANGLE ON:

Cornelius watching from around the corner.

CORNELIUS

...My God!

CAPTAIN

Commander, I have a ship with a main

malfunction. He requests permission to

dock for repairs.

COMMANDER

Did you check out his registration number?

CAPTAIN

Everything's in order.

COMMANDER

Put him in the docking garage and inform

the police.

CAPTAIN (V.O.)

Permission granted. Dock 575.  You have

an hour. Will that be enough time'?

Zorg sits at the controls.

ZORG

(cold)

More than enough.

The ZFX approaches Fhloston.

The ship comes close enough for Leeloo to see it out the window.

FLASHBACK:

The same ships with Mangalores at the controls attack the Mondoshawans at

Leeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam

Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and

CORNELIUS

(in a panic)

Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want

the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped.

We must stop them!. I'm going to free you

but you must promise to help me!

The Chief of Police nods his agreement.

The Mangalores have trashed the suite.  One of the Mangalores finally

I have it.

The Mangalore is about to open the case when... Leeloo descends quietly

MANGALORE

They were waiting for us! It was an

ambush!

AKANIT

If it's war they want it's war they'll get!

Enact the Final Plan!

All the Mangalores cock their weapons.

Leeloo is about to open the case when the door EXPLODES.  Zorg is there

ZORG

My compliments, little lady!

...And thanks for doing all the dirty work!

I couldn't have done it any better myself!

...Now hand over the Stones!

Leeloo smiles and hands him the case.  Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready

ZORG

Nice knowing you.

Leeloo catches on quickly.  She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into

Leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

Zorg fires his 3000 round clip.  The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss

You can run but you can't hide...

Cornelius is seated opposite the Chief of Police.  A MEDIC is bandaging

AKANIT

Nobody move! We're taking over this

ship!

The Chief of Police is goggle-eyed.  Cornelius leans toward him.

CORNELIUS

(pleased with himself)

I told you...

Zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off.

He sighs in exasperation.

Three Mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting.

MANGALORE 1

Everyone down!

There is panic all around.

LOC RHOD

(broadcasting, panic stricken)

Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're being...

attacked.  The place is crawling with warriors.

President Lindberg and his generals look very worried.

Some security guards open fire one of the Mangalores is hit.  The others

More Mangalores rush in from all around shooting.  Two cops are killed.

The Diva... takes a bullet.

She falls from the stage into Korben's arms. He lowers her to the floor.

Zorg's ZFX200 speeds away from the boat.  Zorg is at the controls, a

You want something done, do it yourself!

Fighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to

They're hideous. They've got a crest on

the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers

all over their hands. Totally hideous!

MUNRO

(worried)

...Mangalores!

PRESIDENT

Send a battalion out immediately!

KORBEN

(to the Diva)

I was sent by the government to help you.

DIVA

Don't worry.  This is my fate...

How was the concert?

Korben is a little surprised, but... the Diva is an artist.

KORBEN

I've never heard anything so beautiful

in my life.

A Mangalore jumps on them from the stage.  Korben makes short work of him

DIVA

(weak)

You're a good man...

She was right to have chosen you...

KORBEN

Who?

DIVA

The Fifth Element...

The Supreme Being... Your wife...

Korben is floored.

KORBEN

Leeloo... is... she's...

DIVA

Yes, and more than that... You must

give her the Stones, she's the only one

who knows how to use them.

KORBEN

(to himself, suddenly

realizing)

...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

The Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together.

CORNELIUS

(to the Chief of Police)

Of course I was telling you the truth!...

If you had listened to me in the first place,

we wouldn't be in this predicament now!

Korben wastes two more Mangalores.

DIVA

She needs you. She needs your help and

your love. She's more fragile than she seems...

Korben looks around, ready for another attack.

KORBEN

...Yeah, so am I.

The Diva takes his hand.

DIVA

She was taught to love the life of others...

but not her own. You have to teach her

to love if you want her to truly live!

KORBEN

(uncomfortable)

I'll help her, I promise, but I think you

should tell me where the Stones are!

DIVA

Do you love her?

KORBEN

I... I don't know! We hardly know

each other... it takes time!

DIVA

I don't have time... I need to know.

KORBEN

Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman

I loved her ... I never saw her again.

DIVA

I would like to have died in peace...

The Diva's eyes close.

The timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to "15 minutes".

KORBEN

You tell me to save the world then

you go off and leave me in the shit!

He shakes her, gently slapping her cheeks.

KORBEN

Come on! You're not gonna die in peace!

You're not going to die at all! You hear me?

Where are the Stones?

Zorg sets the Sacred Case on a table in the cockpit.  He opens it with a

He cannot believe his eyes.  He goes berserk, destroying everything in

Korben slaps the Diva soundly.  She comes around somewhat.

KORBEN

I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

They are... with me...

The Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.  Korben frisks the

MANGALORE 2

Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!

Hands on your head and into the hall!

The guests comply

KORBEN

(to himself)

...The Stones are with me?

and then it occurs to him.

KORBEN

...In me?

He touches the Diva's stomach and senses something hard.  Girding

Loc Rhod peeks out from under a seat.

LOC RHOD

Don't you think we'd better be going?

A Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva.  He grabs Korben by

MANGALORE

Hey, you! With the others!

Korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  Just for

KORBEN

That's it... I've had... all day people

have been sticking guns in my face...

Korben wraps up the four Stones in his shirt.

LOC RHOD

Korben man... These dudes are going

to waste us if we don't do what they say.

Korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

KORBEN

You don't do what I say... I'll waste

you myself. Got it?

LOC RHOD

Got it...

President Lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel.

Akanit is still in the police station facing control screens.  He barks

walkie-talkie.

AKANIT

What's the situation in the hall?

Hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall.  They are

There's no more resistance.

Everything's under control.

Three Mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to

Loc Rhod covers his mike.

A Mangalore shoots in their direction.  Loc Rhod flattens himself on the

Toss me the balls!

BABY RAY

Another piece of the bar explodes.

KORBEN

The balls for Christ's sake!

Korben apes playing pool, but Baby Ray really is stone-deaf.

EMPEROR JAPHET

He wants the balls! You deaf or something?

The EMPEROR rolls the balls over to Korben.  The Mangalore loads more

KORBEN

How far is he from here?

The EMPEROR glances at the Mangalore, who in reloading.

The last of the Mangalores have barricaded themselves in the back of the

Korben goes to the door and peeks around the corner.  Loc Rhod arrives.

What's he doing?

Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly.

KORBEN

Six to the left. One to the right.

LOC RHOD

He's on vacation.

KORBEN

(reloading)

We got to find the leader. Mangalores

don't fight without a leader.

Akanit gets up, grabs Cornelius by the throat and put a gun to his head.

AKANIT

One more shot and we start killing

hostages, got that?

KORBEN

Found him...

AKANIT

(tense)

Send someone to negotiate!

KORBEN

Mind if I go? I'm an excellent

negotiator.

COP 1

Uh... Sure, go ahead.

Korben gets ready.

We're sending someone in who's

authorized to negotiate.

Korben walks quickly into the room, heads straight for Akanit, raises his

Anyone else want to negotiate?

COP 2

Where'd he learn to negotiate like that?

MUNRO

The President gives Munro a hard look.

The police round up the remaining Mangalores.  Korben is at the control

CORNELIUS

You're probably very angry with me and

I quite understand. But I want you to

know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

KORBEN

Yeah, I know... to save the world... but

right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

CORNELIUS

Leeloo's in trouble?

KORBEN

When is she not in trouble?

CORNELIUS

Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?

Korben realizes that Cornelius in probably right.

The ZFX200 settles in the landing dock garage.  SECURITY POLICE approach

POLICEMAN

More trouble?

ZORG

Nothing I can't fix myself.

He brings up the ZF1 and wipes out the garage.

Korben enters the Diva's suite which is in shambles.  He looks

Leeloo lies in a pool of blood.  She hears something below her.

Exhausted, Loc Rhod wipes his forehead and finds himself face to face

Korben in busy looking for Leeloo.

KORBEN

Leeloo?

Up in the airshaft, Leeloo has heard him.

LEELOO

Korben...

Her voice is too weak, Korben can't hear her.

LOC RHOD

Korben man... what the hell is this?

Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance.

KORBEN

A molecular bomb.

Three minutes left on the timer.

And, uh, what're these numbers clicking

by?

CORNELIUS

Probably the time remaining before it

explodes.

Cornelius smiles and continues his search.

LOC RHOD

(weak smile)

You're just saying that to scare me! Right?

If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off.

There's bomb detectors in all these hotels!

A general alarm goes off.  Loc Rhod is crushed.

The lights flicker.

This is a Type A alert. For security reasons

the hotel must be evacuated. Please proceed

calmly to the lifeboats located in the main

Maybe we oughta be going,

KORBEN

Not without Leeloo.

Loc Rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb.

LOC RHOD

Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh,

like, we're down to 2 minutes here...

Korben breathes out, bothered.  He turns his attention to the bomb.

KORBEN

It's the latest model.. I've never seen one

before... it works off a magnetic coded

card... Let's see if I can rig it up.

Leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of

Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!

Korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up

Don't worry, I'm here now!

He pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out

KORBEN

Just relax. I've got the Stones.

Everything's going to be fine.

30 seconds left on the timer.

LOC RHOD

(falling to pieces)

Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of

your time here?

KORBEN

(to Leeloo)

I'll be right back.

Korben dashes over to the bomb.  He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1.

ZORG

(smiling)

Allow me...

Zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down

ZORG

Just for the fun of it.

Loc Rhod faints.

ZORG

Well, what do we have here? Is this

Korben Dallas? The famous winner of

the Gemini Croquette contest?

Or is this Korben Dallas from Special

Section sent by old Lindberg himself.

Korben doesn't reply.

ZORG

...In any event, whoever you are,

I was glad to meet you.

Zorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead.  Nothing.  Zorg tries again.

ZORG

...A 3000 round clip! I didn't fire off

3000 rounds... did I?

KORBEN

Don't you know how to count.

It's not all that hard. Watch!

Korben punches him square in the face, shows him his index.

KORBEN

One! That's for trying to kill me!

Second Punch.

KORBEN

Two! That's for firing me! Three!

That's for pushing around a priest!

And the rest is for what you did to

my wife!

Korben pummels him mercilessly.

President Lindberg prefers closing his eyes.  Munro's shoulders move as

Zorg falls to the floor, beaten to a pulp.  The timer clicks over to 3

KORBEN

We're outta here!

He picks Leeloo up in his arms.

Cornelius grabs Loc Rhod and gives him a resounding slap.

LOC RHOD

Are you nuts, Father? That hurts! I

can't feel my teeth.

CORNELIUS

Doesn't matter all you need are your

legs.

The lifeboats launch from the hotel and fly out into space.

Korben, carrying Leeloo, Cornelius and Loc Rhod are in the garage.

Two minutes to complete evacuation...

Korben bursts the lock on the first ship he finds and enters followed by

Korben sets Leeloo down.

Zorg picks up his ZF1, unaware of the bomb and the countdown.

You know how to fly this thing?

Loc Rhod is thrown to the rear of the ship.

CUT TO:

The counter goes 1... 0

-The suite disintegrates - The corridor is consumed.

-The main hall is no more.

The ZFX200 jets away as the enormous oceanliner explodes behind it.

Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form

to stand in the middle there, but...

I don't have the reference book.

I've never seen the Stones work!

Korben can't believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand

The wind blows... the fire burns...

KORBEN

I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking

about the Stones.

Korben is desperate.  Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out

He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.

KORBEN

The rain falls... the wind blows?

Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben.

Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only

KORBEN

Don't breathe.

Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A

A mass of fire fills the screen.  The Earth is only a thousand miles

Two more minutes.

The President shuts his eyes.  His lids move in prayer.

Korben helps Leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors

KORBEN

It's up to you now, Angel!

LEELOO

I'm so tired...

KORBEN

You can sleep tomorrow... come on...

LEELOO

I want to sleep... forever...

KORBEN

Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on

a vacation afterwards! A real vacation,

this time, for as long as you want.

Come on! You can do it!

Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.

Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.

An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

CORNELIUS

Come on Leeloo! Come on!

The beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor.

The Dark Planet hurtles toward Earth.  A hundred miles before impact.

Seconds tick away relentlessly on the scientist's stopwatch.

SCIENTIST

It'll be entering the atmosphere in one

minute.

The heat in the temple is unbearable.  All the walls start to ooze the

KORBEN

Leeloo! If you don't get on with the

program we're all gonna die! And that's

not on my agenda for today.

Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck.

LEELOO

(weak)

What's the use of saving lives...

when you see what you do with them!

KORBEN

You're right but there are lots of good

things... beautiful things...

LEELOO

...Like love...

KORBEN

Exactly.

LEELOO

But I don't know love... I'm like a machine

programmed to save other people's lives but

never to have one of my own.

The Scientist's stopwatch goes from 30 to 29 seconds.

LEELOO

I have thousands of memories but none

of them are mine... There is no need for

me other than this. I'm immortal but I have

no life.

KORBEN

Yes, you do! I need you. More than you

can imagine! Stand up straight!

LEELOO

Why?... Why would you need me?

KORBEN

Because...

CORNELIUS

(to himself)

Tell her, for God's sake!

A bit of the black acid falls on Loc Rhod's shirt setting it on fire.  He

KORBEN

Because...

Leeloo has tears in her eyes.  The heat is overpowering.  Black acid is

LEELOO

Tell me...

KORBEN

I love you...

Despite her fatigue, Leeloo smiles broadly.

CUT TO:

The stopwatch goes from 3 to 2.

LEELOO

Now you're allowed to kiss me.

- Korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he's never kissed

- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet.  Inaudible

- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like

The pure beam, the Light of Life, has finished its work.  The Dark Planet

Strangely enough, it looks like the moon.  Everything is calm around it.

President Lindberg opens his eyes and realizes he's not dead-

SCIENTIST

The planet seems to have stopped at...

62 miles from impact.

In the temple, the beam loses its intensity.  But Leeloo and Korben

Loc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh.  He gives Cornelius a knowing

LOC RHOD

This guy is a killer with the babes.

I knew it from the moment I laid eyes

on him.

Cornelius and Loc Rhod burst out laughing.  Korben and Leeloo keep on

We are in the Nucleological Laboratory that gave birth to Leeloo in the

MUNRO

Mr. President, let me introduce you to

Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

MACTILBURGH

It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

PRESIDENT

(beaming)

Yes.. Well? Where are our two heroes?

MACTILBURGH

They were so tired from their ordeal that

we put them in the reactor this morning..

PRESIDENT

I have 19 more meetings after this one

Professor..

PROFESSOR

Of course.. Let me see if they're revived.

AIDE

We go live in one minute, Mr. President.

Mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him

Leeloo and Korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and

Mactilburgh looks troubled.

MACTILBURGH

I.. uh.. they need five more minutes,

Mr. President.

The President, pressed for time, looks over to his aide who in struggling

AIDE

No ma'am... I tried... No ma'am...

PRESIDENT

Who is it?

AIDE

Some woman... claims she's Korben's

mother...

PRESIDENT

Give it here...

The President takes the phone and goes to the window.

PRESIDENT

Mrs. Dallas, this in the President.

On behalf of the entire Federation,

I would like to thank...

MOTHER (V.O.)

Don't pull that crap with me, Finger...

I'd recognize that trash can voice of

yours in a dark alley during a rain storm.

You tell that worthless no account son

of mine he should plotz for the way he's

ignored his mother... when I think of all I

sacrificed for him...

Outside the lab we see the President through the window, holding the

PAN slowly across Manhattan.

Credits Roll as TWO full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky.
