PETE

Oh, I would, but I'm supposed to work

DEBBIE

PETE

I got an appointment with a trainer. I

can't cancel now, he'll charge me.

DEBBIE

Well, you didn't tell me.

PETE

Yeah I did. Last week, I told you.

DEBBIE

You didn't tell me.

PETE

I did. And then I wrote it on the

calendar like you told me to.

DEBBIE

No, you didn't tell me.

PETE

I did tell you.

DEBBIE

Well, you didn't, but what are we

going to do? Because I have an

appointment so you're taking the kids

to school.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Don't use the baby to cover your

tracks.

ALISON

I can drive them. I'll drive them to

school.

PETE

Thank you very much.

DEBBIE

Great. Good. You turned my sister into

a limo driver.

ALISON

I don't mind.

PETE

(TO CHARLOTTE)

It all worked out!

KNOCKED UP - 3.

ALISON

What are you giggling about?

SADIE

(TO CHARLOTTE)

Be quiet. You're starting to annoy me.

CHARLOTTE

Poo poo.

ALISON

Ladies. Nice.

SADIE

You know what I did the other day?

ALISON

What?

SADIE

I Googled "murder."

ALISON

You Googled "murder?"

SADIE

Yeah.

ALISON

Why? I mean what did it say?

SADIE

It didn't say anything. It just showed

pictures of people lying dead on the

floor and...blood everywhere and

ugh...

ALISON

That was just ketchup.

(BEAT)

Who wants to hear some music?

SADIE

I want to hear "Rent."

CHARLOTTE

CHARLOTTE

(CRYING)

ALISON

things at your sister!

CHARLOTTE

She hit me.

ALISON

Did you hit her?

SADIE

I did not.

ALISON

Make her happy.

(TO CHARLOTTE)

It's okay.

SADIE

It won't make her happy. She spilled

all the marbles on the floor.

ALISON

Well, give her her marbles back.

JACK

Thanks for coming in, Alison. Well, we

wanted to talk to you today because we

had a little debate on the conference

call with New York about you.

ALISON

You were talking about me?

JACK

We were wondering aloud to one another

whether or not you would be good for

on-camera.

ALISON

What'd you decide?

JILL

They decided that they like you. And

they would like to put you on camera.

ALISON

on the scale and write down how much

you weigh and subtract it by, like,

twenty.

ALISON

Twenty.

JILL

And then weigh that much.

JACK

Just remember, you've got it here,

you've got it here, and everybody's

DEBBIE

Yay! That's so exciting!

ALISON

Oh, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Yay!

DEBBIE

Let's go celebrate.

ALISON

Okay, let's do it.

KNOCKED UP - 11.

DEBBIE

Pete'll watch the kids?

PETE

Yeah! We can watch "Taxicab

Confessions."

DEBBIE

What are you going to do?

ALISON

I don't know!

DEBBIE

I'm so excited.

ALISON

Yay!

DEBBIE

I walked in on him masturbating one

night.

ALISON

Ooh! Did you get the deer-in-the-

headlights look? Did he freeze or did

he finish?

DEBBIE

No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't

doing anything under the covers.

ALISON

Oh, no!

DEBBIE

I buy these nice towels and he whacks

off into them.

ALISON

"Deb and Pete forever"

DEBBIE

And once he does that into them once,

they're never soft ever again.

DEBBIE

I can always tell if I'm looking good

based on whether or not we get in.

KNOCKED UP - 12.

BOUNCER

Ladies?

ALISON

Guess we're looking good.

DEBBIE

If I didn't get in, I would have lost

my shit.

BEN

What's going on man? How long you

gonna make us wait out here, for

Christ's sake?

JAY

Come on! What the fuck!

BEN

You know what movie I just saw again

the other day which is fucking, like,

mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it

since it came out? "Munich."

JAY

"Munich!"

JONAH

Dude, "Munich" fuckin' rules.

JAY

"Munich" is awesome!

BEN

That movie was Eric Bana kicking

fuckin' ass!

BEN (CONT'D)

Dude, every movie with Jews, we're the

ones getting killed. "Munich" flips it

on its ear. We cappin' motherfuckers.

JONAH

Not only killing, but fuckin', like,

takin' names.

BEN

If any of us get laid tonight, it's

because of Eric Bana in "Munich."

JONAH

I agree with that.

JAY

I agree.

KNOCKED UP - 13.

BEN

You know what is not helping us get

laid? Is the shoe bomber, Richard

Reid, over here at our table. I like

your shoes.

JONAH

How was "Burning Man" this year?

BEN

Fuck you guys, I'm glad I'm not

Jewish.

BEN (CONT'D)

So are we.

MARTIN

Fine. Screw it.

BEN

You weren't "chosen" for a reason.

JAY

Yeah. Ahh!

JASON

Ohh!!!

DEBBIE

It's like everyone in here is twelve

years old.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Am I too old to be here?

ALISON

What?

DEBBIE

Am I too old to be here?

ALISON

No, of course not.

DEBBIE

Does it look weird that I'm here?

ALISON

No, not at all.

DEBBIE

Am I hotter than these little bitches?

ALISON

Yes! You look amazing.

DEBBIE

Guys in here would fuck me, right?

KNOCKED UP - 14.

ALISON

Yes.

DEBBIE

That's weird to say, but, it makes me

feel better.

ALISON

You look hot.

DEBBIE

I believe you.

ALISON

I'm getting us drinks.

BEN

Yo, a beer over here, please? You're

gonna be embarrassed when you realize

I'm Wilmer Valderrama. God.

ALISON

(to the Bartender)

Oh, Hey! Excuse me!

BEN

He's literally ignoring this entire

half of the bar. Don't even bother.

ALISON

Yeah, awesome.

BEN

A beer over here, please? He looked at

us! Did you see that?

ALISON

Yeah, that was rough.

BEN

And if you can't get service, what am

I gonna do, you know?

ALISON

Great. It's going to be that night.

BEN

Okay, you want a beer?

ALISON

Yeah.

BEN

Just observe.

KNOCKED UP - 15.

BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)

There you go.

BARTENDER

Come on, man!

BEN

Here you go! For your trouble! Thank

you.

BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)

(TO ALISON)

There you go.

ALISON

Thank you.

BEN

Okay, enjoy it.

ALISON

Are you sure?

BEN

I'm sure. I tried that once before at

The Comedy Store and I got punched in

the ear.

ALISON

Thanks a lot, Oh, fuck, fuck! I'm

supposed to get one for my sister.

BEN

Oh, here, take mine.

ALISON

No, that's okay. I'll wait. I'll,

he'll get me--

BEN

(INTERRUPTING)

Please, I very rarely look cool. This

is a big moment for me. Just take it.

ALISON

Thank you. Awesome.

BEN

No problem.

ALISON

I'm Alison.

BEN

I'm Ben.

KNOCKED UP - 16.

ALISON

Well, have a great night.

BEN

Okay, you too. Have a--

ALISON

Thanks for the beer.

BEN

Okay, enjoy, be nice to them.

ALISON

Bye. Thanks again.

BEN

I'll see ya later.

(TO HIMSELF)

No, I won't, `cause I'm a pussy.

JASON

What's up, daddy?

BEN

That girl. She, she totally gave me an

opening, man, and I locked up. I just

want to get shit-faced, though, you

know? I'll just jerk it later. It's

cool.

JASON

Are you fuckin' crazy, man? She

looks...smart. Who's that she's

sitting with?

BEN

It's her sister.

JASON

Her sister?

BEN

Yeah.

JASON

Dude, it's the dream. What are we

doin' standing here man? Let's go.

Come on, follow me.

(TO MARTIN)

You stay here.

MARTIN

Why?

JASON

`Cause your face looks like a vagina.

KNOCKED UP - 17.

MARTIN

Dick!

JASON

Hey, which one's the sister?

JONAH

Hey, Crockett. You still partyin' with

Tubbs these days?

MARTIN

Come on, man. I'm getting it from all

angles here. I don't like it anymore.

JONAH

I know, I don't either. Was it weird

when you changed your name from Cat

Stevens to Yusuf Islam?

MARTIN

Yeah, it was really awkward.

JONAH

All right, man. I got to take off. See

ya, "Scorsese on coke."

MARTIN

What's that?

JAY

Chewbacca. It's, you know, it's

Chewie.

MARTIN

Oh, another beard joke.

JAY

Fuck.

MARTIN

Fuckin' hilarious!

BEN

Hey.

ALISON

Hey.

BEN

Hi, this is my friend, Jason. I just

wanted to see how my beers were doin'.

ALISON

This is my sister, Debbie.

KNOCKED UP - 18.

BEN

Oh, hi, I'm Ben.

DEBBIE

Hi, Ben?

BEN

Yes.

DEBBIE

Nice to meet you.

JASON

How ya doin'?

DEBBIE

Good, how are you?

JASON

Just trying not to stare.

ALISON

She's married.

DEBBIE

(TO ALISON)

Why do you have to say that?

ALISON

What?

JASON

It's a shame. You're beautiful.

DEBBIE

Thank you.

ALISON

She has two kids, too.

DEBBIE

Shut up!

ALISON

What? It's nothing to be ashamed of.

BEN

You think that's gonna stop him from

hitting on her? It's not, at all.

JASON

I love kids.

DEBBIE

Really?

JASON

Yeah, absolutely.

KNOCKED UP - 19.

DEBBIE

Excuse me.

(into the phone)

Hello?

BEN

Cool phone.

ALISON

Yeah, she's got a really cool phone.

DEBBIE

(into the phone)

What? Is it a rash or is it the

chicken pox? I don't know! Google it.

Okay. All right, bye.

(to Alison et al)

I got to go. Sadie might have the

chicken pox.

JASON

I had the chicken pox three times. I

have no immunity to it.

BEN

We don't have the heart to tell him

it's herpes.

JASON

It's not herpes if it's everywhere.

DEBBIE

(TO ALISON)

Are you coming?

ALISON

Um, uh, you know, I'm all dressed, so

I'll just hang out.

DEBBIE

Really?

ALISON

Yeah, I'll take a cab home.

DEBBIE

Be safe.

ALISON

I will.

JASON

Bye, lovely.

DEBBIE

Bye.

JASON

All right, I'm gonna let you two get

to know each other.

ALISON (CONT'D)

How are you?

JAMES FRANCO

Great.

KNOCKED UP - 29.

ALISON

Thanks for coming.

JAMES FRANCO

Of course.

ALISON

Tell me, were you a big fan...

ALISON (CONT'D)

...I'm sorry, let me take that again.

JAMES FRANCO

Okay.

ALISON

Tell me, were you a big fan of the

comic books growing up?

JAMES FRANCO

No, actually, I didn't read any of the

comic books until I got the movie.

JAMES FRANCO (cont'd)

Are you okay?

ALISON

Uh-huh. Yeah, just, what about the

comic books? Keep talking.

JAMES FRANCO

Like I said I really wasn't into them,

but now that I did the research, I

think they're pretty amazing.

JAMES FRANCO (cont'd)

What the fuck?

BRENT

Is that the sound of you puking?

JAMES FRANCO (ON TV MONITOR)

If this is one of those fuckin' joke

shows, I'm not into it.

BRENT

We should put this on YouTube.

ALISON

Shut up.

KNOCKED UP - 30.

BRENT

This is hilarious.

ALISON

You're an asshole.

BRENT

Look how sweaty you are. You look like

Dom DeLuise.

ALISON

I don't need to see it again. It's

gonna make me throw up.

BRENT

You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.

ALISON

You're such an asshole.

BRENT

I'm just jerking your chain. I'll fix

this. No problem.

ALISON

Yeah, maybe if you can just edit this

out and we can re--

ALISON (CONT'D)

--we can reshoot my questions.

BRENT

What's up?

BRENT (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Over

here. Not on the mixing board, not on

the mixing board.

BRENT (CONT'D)

Are you okay?

ALISON

Oh my god. Oh my god.

BRENT

Are you sick?

ALISON

I don't know.

BRENT

What'd you eat?

KNOCKED UP - 31.

ALISON

I haven't eaten today yet.

BRENT

You haven't eaten yet?

ALISON

Do you have a napkin or something?

BRENT

Here, here. What do you have, like the

flu?

ALISON

I don't know.

BRENT

God, I hope you're not pregnant.

ALISON

It's impossible. You have to have sex

to get pregnant.

BRENT

(into the phone)

B.K. It's Brent Master Five. Alison

just puked. Dude, that's what I said.

She's probably pregnant, right?

ALISON

Oh, shit.

BRENT

(into the phone)

How does she look right now? She looks

like she just realized that she's

pregnant.

ALISON

No, I can't be pregnant. Right? That

was what, eight weeks ago?

DEBBIE

Did you miss your period?

ALISON

No. Wait. I don't know. Shit. I don't

know. I can't remember. I was, I mean,

I've been really stressed at work. I

can't remember my last period.

DEBBIE

Are you the lady who doesn't realize

she's pregnant until she's sitting on

the toilet and a kid pops out?

KNOCKED UP - 32.

ALISON

Can you not joke right now? Don't joke

right now. This is really serious.

DEBBIE

Did I meet him?

ALISON

Yeah. You know, he was kind of like

medium height, sort of...chubby.

Blonde, curly hair. Remember?

DEBBIE

With the man boobs.

ALISON

Yes! Here, I have this thing of him on

my phone.

BEN (ON PHONE VIDEO)

Hey! I live in your phone! This is the

best night of my life! I gotta pee.

DEBBIE

Oh god. How did this happen?

ALISON

Oh, shit.

DEBBIE

Well there's only one way to find out.

DEBBIE

They're here! Here they are! Over

here!

ALISON

Okay. "Positive Choice."

DEBBIE

"Easy, One, Two, Three."

ALISON

Here. Hurry up now. Come on.

KNOCKED UP - 33.

ALISON (CONT'D)

Get more! Get me a few more!

DEBBIE

Did you try the "Ova-Sure?"

ALISON

I'm dripping, I'm dripping. Wait.

DEBBIE

Good! A smiley face! Oh, I think

that's bad.

ALISON

How long does this one take?

DEBBIE

These can't all be positive. Let me

try one.

ALISON

God, you really had to pee.

DEBBIE

What is this? What the hell is this?

ALISON

I think you picked up the wrong one.

DEBBIE

Fuck. That scared me. That would suck.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. That scared me.

ALISON

It's gonna be fine. Right?

ALISON (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Right?

DEBBIE

Of course it will be fine. It's gonna

be fine.

KNOCKED UP - 34.

ALISON

Shit.

DEBBIE

You just need to call him.

ALISON

Maybe I don't need to call him until

after I see the doctor.

DEBBIE

You need to call.

ALISON

I don't want to call him. I don't need

to call him.

DEBBIE

You should call.

ALISON

I can't call him anyway. He doesn't

even have a phone. He didn't even have

a number to give me.

DEBBIE

He doesn't have a phone?

ALISON

Said some kind of billing issue.

DEBBIE

He can't afford a phone? Sadie has a

phone.

ALISON

Shit, you're right. I got to call. I

don't know. I'm gonna have to look him

up on his stupid website.

DEBBIE

What kind of website does he have?

DEBBIE

He spelling "coming" wrong. Oh it's

"cum." That's gross.

ALISON

Just go to "Contact Us."

DEBBIE

Ben?

ALISON

Yeah.

KNOCKED UP - 35.

DEBBIE

"What is your number? I need to speak

with you right away." Send?

ALISON

Yep.

DEBBIE

You're sure?

ALISON

Yeah.

JAY

I love weed.

JONAH

I could smoke weed every second of

every day.

BEN

(through the mask)

Jay, I am your stoner.

JASON

Hey, Benjamin?

BEN

Yeah.

JASON

"Flesh of the Stars" just got an e-

BEN

Really?

JASON

Would you like me to read it to you?

BEN

Yeah, sure.

JASON

"Ben, what is your number? I need to

speak to you right away. Alison Scott"

BEN, JASON & JONAH

Ohhhhhh!

BEN

Shit! Someone wants seconds, mama!

KNOCKED UP - 36.

JAY

Somebody wants another piece!

BEN

Booty, booty, booty call.

Hello?

ALISON

Hi, Ben, this is Alison. I don't know

if you remember me.

BEN

(into the phone)

Oh, yeah, Alison. What's up?

JONAH

She like-a the way your dick tastes.

ALISON

(into the phone)

I actually was just wondering if maybe

you, wanted to get together, like

tomorrow night?

KNOCKED UP - 37.

BEN

(into the phone)

I've been meaning to call you so we

could hook up again. You know what I'm

sayin'?

ALISON

(into the phone)

Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night?

You wanna just grab some dinner?

BEN

(into the phone)

Why not? Meeting of minds sounds good.

What do you say Geisha House,

Hollywood, nine o'clock?

ALISON

(into the phone)

Sure. That's cool. Can we make it more

like six, though? I'd like to keep it

early.

BEN

(into the phone)

Six o'clock. Beat the rush. Yeah,

leave more time for afterwards.

Dessert. Sweet.

ALISON

(into the phone)

Okay. I'll just meet you there, then,

at six.

BEN

(into the phone)

I'll see you there. Take care. Peace.

ALISON

Oh, shit.

BEN

I am going to the doctor next

with me to the gynecologist.

BEN

So you haven't seen him, though?

ALISON

No.

BEN

So you don't know if you're pregnant.

ALISON

Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure.

BEN

You're not a hundred percent sure. I

bet you're not pregnant.

DR. PELLAGRINO'S NURSE

Alison Scott?

ALISON

Yeah, yeah.

(TO BEN)

Come on.

BEN

I'm supposed to go?

ALISON

Yes.

DR. PELLAGRINO

Hello. My name is Thomas Pellagrino.

BEN

I'm Ben Stone.

DR. PELLAGRINO

Hi, there, champ. And you must be

Debbie's sister...Alice.

ALISON

Alison.

DR. PELLAGRINO

Hi. How are ya?

KNOCKED UP - 42.

ALISON

Good.

DR. PELLAGRINO

So, what can I help you with today,

Mister and Mrs. Stone?

ALISON

I took a home pregnancy test and it

said I was pregnant, so here we are.

DR. PELLAGRINO

Let's have a look. Legs up.

BEN

Nice office.

DR. PELLAGRINO

Thank you.

DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd)

Well, you do look a lot like your

sister.

DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd)

This is gonna be cold.

(TO BEN)

And you're next. I'm just kidding.

DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd)

There's the cervix. And the uterus.

See that? That dark sac there, that's

the amniotic sac. And right there, in

the middle is the embryo. Do you see

that flicker? You know what that is?

That's the heartbeat. Yeah, it looks

like you are pregnant. About eight or

nine weeks, I'd say. Congratulations.

ALISON

That, that's it?

DR. PELLAGRINO

Yep. Take good care of it. Now the fun

part starts. Let me make a picture for

ya, huh? That'll be fun.

DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Well, I'll meet ya in my office. I'll

give ya a little time alone, there.

KNOCKED UP - 43.

BEN

Oh, God. It's okay.

JONAH

I can't fuckin' believe you didn't

wear a bag! Who does that?!

JASON

Why did we go to Costco and buy a

year's supply of condoms if you

weren't gonna use `em, man?

JONAH

I can't believe you did this. You

fucked everything up.

JASON

Look, the real point is not to get

yourself in this position. That's what

you have to realize. You gotta know

all the tricks. Like, for example, if

a woman's on top, she can't get

pregnant. It's just gravity.

JONAH

Everyone knows that.

JASON

What goes up must come down.

JAY

I think it's awesome that you're gonna

have a kid, man. Think of it like

this. It's just an excuse to play with

all your old toys again.

JONAH

You know what I think you should do?

Take care of it.

JAY

Tell me you don't want him to get an

"A word."

JONAH

Yes, I do, and I won't say it for

little Baby Ears over there, but it

rhymes with shmish-mortion." I'm just

saying -- hold on Jay, cover your ears

-- you should get a "shmish-morshmion"

are the "shmish-morshmion" clinic.

JAY

Ben, you cannot let these monsters

have any part of your child's life.

All right? I'm gonna be there to rear

your child.

KNOCKED UP - 44.

JASON

You hear that, Ben? Don't let him near

the kid. He wants to rear your child!

JONAH

Aw, Ben. Ben, come on, man.

JASON

I'm just kidding you.

JAY

Oh, great. Now he's upset.

JASON

I won't let him do it.

BETTY

Alison, just take care of it. Take

care of it. Move on. What's gonna

happen with your career? Or how, how

are you gonna tell them?

ALISON

Well, I'm not gonna tell them for a

while. I have a while before I have to

say anything.

BETTY

How could you not tell them?

ALISON

Well, they're not gonna know. I mean,

I'm only gonna start to show when I'm

like, I don't know, six months or

something. Seven months.

BETTY

Three months.

ALISON

No.

BETTY

Three months. Fat in the face, jowls,

fast ass.

ALISON

Debbie didn't get fat.

BETTY

Debbie is a freak of nature.

ALISON

Mom, you know, it's important to me

that you be supportive.

KNOCKED UP - 45.

BETTY

I cannot be supportive of this. This

is a mistake. This is a big, big

mistake. Now think about your

stepsister. Now, you remember what

happened with her? She had the same

situation as you and she had it taken

care of. And you know what? Now she

has a real baby. Honey, this is not

the time.

HARRIS

I'm gonna be a grandfather.

BEN

You happy about that?

HARRIS

Absolutely. Delighted.

BEN

This is a disaster.

HARRIS

No, this is not a disaster.

BEN

It is, you know?

HARRIS

An earthquake is a disaster. Your

grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad

she doesn't even know who the fuck I

am, that's a disaster. This is a good

thing. This is a blessing.

BEN

I had a vision for how my life would

go and this definitely is not it.

HARRIS

Wait. Are you living your vision right

now?

BEN

I am kinda living my vision, yeah.

HARRIS

Well, that is sad, I'm telling you.

Life doesn't care about your vision.

Okay?

BEN

Okay.

HARRIS

Stuff happens. You just got to deal

with it. Roll with it. That's the

beauty of it all.

KNOCKED UP - 46.

BEN

I just don't get how I tell the kid

not to do drugs when I do drugs. I'll

feel like a hypocrite.

HARRIS

Well you remember what I told you?

When you were a teenager?

BEN

What did you say?

HARRIS

I said, "No pill, no powders."

BEN

That's right, that's right.

HARRIS

Right. If it grows in the ground, it's

probably okay.

BEN

I guess it worked. You told me not to

smoke pot all those years. And then I

found out you were smoking pot that

whole time.

HARRIS

Not the whole time. Just in the

evenings and all day every weekend.

Not that much.

BEN

Honestly, though, when you look at me,

do you not think at all, like, you

know, if he just never existed, I

would have avoided a massive heap of

trouble? You know?

HARRIS

Absolutely not. I love you totally and

completely. You're the best thing that

ever happened to me.

BEN

I'm the best thing that ever happened

to you?

HARRIS

Yeah.

BEN

Now I just feel bad for you.

KNOCKED UP - 47.

BEN

Hello?

ALISON

Hi, Ben?

BEN

Hey Alison, how's it goin'?

ALISON

Good, good. You know, I was just

calling to, let you know that, I've

decided to keep the baby.That's what's

happening with that.

BEN

Good. That's good. That's what I was

hoping you'd do. So, awesome.

ALISON

Yeah, yeah, it is good.

BEN

I know we didn't plan this and neither

of us really thought it was gonna

happen but life is like that, you

know? You can't plan for it and even

if we did, life doesn't care about

your plans, necessarily, and you just

kinda have to go with the flow and I

just know my job is to just support

you in whatever it is you wanna do.

I'm in, so whatever you wanna do, I'm

gonna do.

BEN(CONT'D)

I'm on board. Yaaay.

ALISON

I really appreciate you saying that.

BEN

No problem. I'll tell you, maybe if

you could help me by telling me, like

one thing that I am supposed to do,

then that would be good, `cause I

literally have no idea whatsoever.

ALISON

I have no idea either.

BEN

Do you want to, like, get together and

talk about it or something like that?

ALISON

Yeah, sure.

BEN

Like a date? I mean...

KNOCKED UP - 48.

ALISON

Yeah.

BEN

HEY

ALISON

Hi.

BEN

You look beautiful.

ALISON

Thank you.

BEN

No problem. Come on in.

Everyone, this is Alison.

ALISON

Hi.

JASON

Ally. Hey. Jason. I'm sure you

remember.

ALISON

Yes.

JASON

You look beautiful.

ALISON

Thank you.

JASON

Your body's responding really well to

the pregnancy.

ALISON

Thank you.

JASON

It's amazing how fast the milk

arrives. How's your sis?

ALISON

She's good.

KNOCKED UP - 49.

JASON

Oh, good. Tell her "What's up" for me.

ALISON

Okay.

JASON

All right, I'm gonna go make a protein

shake.

BEN

And this, uh, beautiful young man is

Jonah.

ALISON

Hi.

JONAH

Hey.

BEN

Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over

there.

ALISON

Hi.

BEN

I'm gonna grab my shirt. Just take a

seat if you want.

JONAH

Just another day at the office. Do you

have any acting experience?

ALISON

No.

MARTIN

How's it goin'? You wanna toke?

ALISON

Eh, no. I'm good.

JODI

Hi.

ALISON

Hi.

JODI

I'm Jodi.

ALISON

Yeah, hi.

JODI

I heard you were pregnant.

ALISON

Mm-hm.

KNOCKED UP - 50.

JODI

Oh, aren't you scared? The way it's

gonna come out of your...It's gonna

hurt a lot I bet. Your vagina...That's

so sick.

ALISON

I don't know.

JODI

Are you hungry?

ALISON

I'm okay right now. Thank you.

JODI

You must be angry at the baby whenever

it steals your food, huh? "Oh it's

mine, not yours." But, you know...

Because you're family, you got to

share.

ALISON

Right.

JAY

Man, my balls are shaved. My pubes are

trimmed. I'm ready to fuckin' rock

this shit.

JONAH

What the fuck, man?! If I go in there

and see fuckin' pubes sprinkled on the

toiled seat, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my

mind! Last time I went to the

bathroom, Jay, I took a shit and my

shit looked like a fuckin' stuffed

animal!

JAY

You're embarrassing me in company!

JONAH

You embarrass yourself!

JAY

Oh, great. I hope you have a great

evening!

BEN

All right. Let's go. See you guys

later.

KNOCKED UP - 51.

ALISON

The funny thing is I really had never

even thought about having a baby.

BEN

Yeah.

ALISON

If this hadn't happened, I don't think

I would have wanted to have a baby

for, like, I don't know, at least ten

years.

BEN

At least! God, honestly, I just got

used to the notion that someone would

even have sex with me. I didn't think

this would happen.

BEN

Get ready. This will be coming out of

you in seven months. This is exactly

what our baby will look like.

ALISON

It's a beautiful picture, Ben.

BEN

It is. It's not bad.

(in a French accent)

Hello, Mommy. Our baby's gonna be

French Canadian. I like that.

ALISON

With a little hint of Spanish.

BEN

Exactly, I'm not good with accents.

KNOCKED UP - 52.

BEN

Baby books.

ALISON

Awesome.

BEN

"What to Expect When You're

Expecting."

ALISON

What can we expect?

BEN

Well, you can't eat sushi. You can't

smoke. You can't smoke marijuana. You

can't smoke crack. And you can't jump

on trampolines. This is basically a

giant list of things you can't do.

ALISON

It sounds thrilling.

BEN

I'm gonna be sitting there on the

trampoline smoking crack. And you're

not gonna have anything to do. You're

gonna be bored. But I can't wait to

read these, honestly. I put these in

front of my toilet, though, they'll be

read by tomorrow morning. Do you want

me to get you that?

ALISON

Yeah, thank you.

BEN

No problem. These are heavy.

PETE

So what do you think? Should we have

sex tonight?

DEBBIE

Ugh. Sounds awful. I'm just really

constipated. Do you really want to?

PETE

Well, now.

DEBBIE

Shut up.

KNOCKED UP - 53.

PETE

That's pretty crazy how your sister's

pregnant.

DEBBIE

We have to help her.

PETE

I think they'll be fine. They'll work

it...Look at us. It happened to us.

DEBBIE

We'll help her raise the baby.

PETE

Well...fuck!

BEN

At least we don't have to use a

condom, you know?

BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)

But we can. I brought some just in

case. I don't have V.D. or anything. I

mean, I don't, I thought--

ALISON

It's not that.

BEN

It's just I thought we could get a

little...fun out of your situation,

you know?

ALISON

Okay, first of all, it's not my

situation. It's our situation.

BEN

I know that.

ALISON

And just because I'm pregnant, I'm not

some ruined woman and all romance goes

out the door.

BEN

I'm sorry. I like you a lot. That's

all this is.

ALISON

I like you, too.

KNOCKED UP - 54.

BEN

Sweet.

ALISON

A little, so far. I mean, we have

seven months before the baby comes. We

don't have to rush it.

BEN

Yeah.

ALISON

We should really just try to get to

know each other and...give this a real

shot. You know? We got ourselves into

this situation. We kind of have to.

BEN

For the baby, right?

ALISON

Exactly. Okay, if this was our second

date, what would you do?

BEN

B.J. If I'm just being honest. I told

my roommates that I thought I was

gonna get a B.J., so...

ALISON

You know what? For the sake of getting

to know one another, can you not talk

like that?

BEN

I can do that. I'm really nervous.

ALISON

I'm nervous, too. I'm really nervous.

BEN

Yeah.

ALISON

You're a sweet guy, right?

BEN

I think I am.

ALISON

Don't fuck me over, okay?

BEN

I wouldn't do that. Just so you know,

I'm the guy girls fuck over. I'm that

guy. So you don't fuck me over, okay?

ALISON

Okay.

BEN

I couldn't take it. I can't raise this

baby alone.

KNOCKED UP - 55.

CHARLOTTE

Who's he?

BEN

I'm Ben Stone.

ALISON

He's my boyfriend.

PETE

That's nice.

SADIE

I never met him before.

ALISON

He's a new boyfriend.

BEN

But a boyfriend.

SADIE

So he came over for breakfast because

he's your new boyfriend?

DEBBIE

He came from his house, drove over to

our house because he thought it would

be fun to have breakfast with us, so

he drove his car from his house to our

house to have breakfast.

PETE

Because he likes breakfast so much.

CHARLOTTE

I love breakfast.

BEN

You guys wanna hear something neat?

We're gonna have a baby together.

SADIE

What?

BEN

Yeah, a baby.

SADIE

Well, you're not married. Aren't you

supposed to be married to have a baby?

KNOCKED UP - 56.

PETE

You don't have to be.

DEBBIE

But they should be because they love

each other and people who love each

other get married and have babies.

SADIE

Where do babies come from?

DEBBIE

Where do you think they come from?

SADIE

Well, I think a stork, he drops it

down, and then, a hole goes in your

body and there's blood everywhere,

coming out of your head, and then you

push your belly-button, and then your

butt falls off and then you hold you

butt and you have to dig and you find

a little baby.

DEBBIE

That's exactly right.

CHARLOTTE

Feed the teddy bear.

BEN

I feed your bear the grass? Know what

your bear would also like to do with

some grass? Smoke it.

ALISON

(TO DEBBIE)

What do you think of him? He's funny,

right?

BEN

Fetch. All right, bring it back.

DEBBIE

(TO ALISON)

He's playing fetch with my kids. He's

treating my kids like they're dogs.

ALISON

(TO DEBBIE)

No's he not.

KNOCKED UP - 57.

BEN

Go get it! Fetch!

DEBBIE

(TO ALISON)

Plays fetch with the kids.

BEN

All right!

ALISON

(TO DEBBIE)

He's trying. He's making an effort.

CHARLOTTE

I don't wanna play this anymore.

BEN

Bring it back.

DEBBIE

(TO ALISON)

He's overweight. Where does that end?

How old is he?

ALISON

(TO DEBBIE)

Twenty-three.

DEBBIE

(TO ALISON)

Looks thirty-three. He can barely get

in and out of that little house.

Imagine how much bigger he's going to

get.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

That means he has bad genes. Your kid

is going to be overweight.

ALISON

Shit.

BEN

I'm gonna get you!

BEN (CONT'D)

I'm gonna get you! Whoa!

ALISON

(TO DEBBIE)

Just give him a break.

DEBBIE

(TO ALISON)

Okay, I'll try.

KNOCKED UP - 58.

BEN

They seem to love bubbles.

PETE

They go ape-shit over bubbles.

BEN

They're really going ape-shit.

PETE

That's an incredible thing about a

child. What's so great about bubbles?

BEN

They float. You can pop them. I mean,

I get it. I get it.

PETE

I wish I liked anything as much as my

kids like bubbles.

BEN

That's sad.

PETE

It's totally sad. Their smiling faces

just point out your inability to enjoy

anything.

BEN

Am I going to be okay, man?

PETE

Who knows? Is anybody okay? I'm not

okay. You're asking the wrong guy.

Just don't ask me to lend you any

money, you know?

BEN

Can I just have some?

PETE

No.

ALISON

I know. That's so crazy.

BEN

You got me. You got me.

ALISON

How many doctors are there in your

practice? Just because I'm sort of

looking for a more personal

experience. I want to make sure that

you're my doctor on the day and...

DR. HOWARD

I understand. We have three other

doctors in the practice but I'm your

man, okay? I don't take vacations. I

hate Hawaii. I went to the Caribbean

when I was fourteen and I'm never

going back.

ALISON

I feel really good about this.

I think we found our doctor.

Really?

ALISON

Yeah.

Oh, my God. Are you serious right now?

You're pregnant aren't you?

ALISON

What?

WARDROBE LADY

I mean, you've put on like eight

pounds, nine. It's all in your uterus.

ALISON

Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you

think they're gonna be mad? I'm really

chickening out about this.

WARDROBE LADY

It's okay. We can hide this. We'll

dress you in black and we'll emphasize

your boobs.

KNOCKED UP - 65.

ALISON

Awesome.

WARDROBE LADY

Your boobs are going to be big. And

then they're going to be like scary

big. But then they'll go down. And

then they'll stay down.

ALISON

Just don't say anything, okay? Please

don't say anything.

WARDROBE LADY

I won't. Just tell them. They'll be

cool. Everybody loves somebody

pregnant.

DEBBIE

Ooh. Did you see this sex offender

website? These are all the sex

offenders in our neighborhood.

DEBBIE

Those are sex offenders. These people

PETE

We'll skip their houses when we're

trick or treating. What do you want me

to do? Form a posse?

(TO BEN)

Got your six-shooter on ya? I got my

lynching rope.

DEBBIE

You shouldn't take it so lightly.

PETE

I don't take it lightly. I'm not going

to go over to any of these people's

houses and say, "Hey, you mind? Can

you baby sit?"

DEBBIE

If I didn't care about these things,

you wouldn't care about anything. Care

more.

KNOCKED UP - 66.

PETE

You're so concerned with stuff, like

don't get them vaccinated, don't let

them eat fish. There's mercury in the

water. Jesus, how much "Dateline NBC"

can you watch?

DEBBIE

I know we're supposed to be nice with

each other right now, but I'm having a

really hard time. I'm struggling with

it right now.

PETE

What am I doing?

DEBBIE

Because I want to rip your fucking

head off because you're so fucking

stupid! This is scary.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

These are our children. You fucking

dipshit!

PETE

I literally am at a point where I

don't know what I can say.

DEBBIE

So I'm the bad guy because I'm trying

to protect our kids from child

molesters and mercury? And you're cool

because you don't give a shit?

PETE

Yeah.

DEBBIE

Yeah? Is that it?

PETE

Pretty much.

DEBBIE

God, you're an asshole.

PETE

Don't do this in front of Ben.

DEBBIE

I don't give a shit about Ben.

PETE

Sorry, Ben.

BEN

It's okay. I didn't think she did,

anyway.

ALISON

Okay, come on! Let's go.

KNOCKED UP - 67.

PETE

I can't go. This band is doing a

showcase out in the Valley. I got to

go.

DEBBIE

It's Saturday.

PETE

I got to go.

DEBBIE

You don't want to know the sex of the

baby? That's no fun.

ALISON

Ben knows, but I've sworn him to

secrecy.

DEBBIE

I'll get it out of him.

BEN

Hey. Think we'll ever be as happy as

Baby Bjorn couple is?

ALISON

We are that happy.

BEN

Yeah. You look happy.

ALISON

Which is awesome. Because I never like

guys like you. It's great.

BEN

You keep saying that. I know.

DEBBIE

This is it. This is perfect.

BEN

Nice.

BEN (CONT'D)

Holy shit, it's fourteen hundred

bucks.

KNOCKED UP - 68.

ALISON

(TO DEBBIE)

We can just borrow yours. Is that

okay?

DEBBIE

No. You need your own crib.

BEN

There's one of these in an alley

behind my house. We could just grab

that. Just rub Purell all over it.

DEBBIE

You know what? Let me buy it. I need

to get you a baby present anyway, and

I would love to get it for you.

ALISON

No.

DEBBIE

I'm serious. I want to.

ALISON

No. It's too much.

BEN

(whispering to Alison)

Shh. Yes. We'll take it obviously. I

mean don't insult the woman. She wants

to get us a gift.

DEBBIE

Right.

BEN

Want to buy me some new clothes? What

else can I squeeze out of you?

XBOX360, XBOX360.

ALISON

It's so hot in the Valley.

GIRL #1

Hey!

GIRL #2

Oh, my God!

ALISON

Oh, shit.

GIRL #1

BEN

KNOCKED UP - 70.

ALISON

All right.

BEN

You know they say don't drink and

drive?

GUY #1

Right.

BEN

Don't drink and bone!

GIRL #2

Wow.

BEN

Yeah, she was acting weird and I

really think it's just because I

haven't made an honest woman out of

her. She's carrying my bastard child.

No one wants that.

PETE

That's what I did. I married Debbie

when she got pregnant.

BEN

You think she's, like, hiding me?

Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me

or something like that?

PETE

Probably. I'd hide you.

BEN

How much do wedding rings cost?

PETE

It really depends, you know? I think

you're supposed to spend three months

pay on a ring.

BEN

That'll be easy. I don't make any

money.

PETE

Really? I thought there was a lot of

money in porn.

KNOCKED UP - 71.

BEN

God, it's not porn? All we do is we

show you what nude scenes are in what

movies.

PETE

Like Mister Skin?

BEN

Who's Mister Skin?

PETE

Dude, Mister Skin.

JONAH

We've wasted fourteen months of our

lives.

BEN

This is exactly the same as our site.

How the fuck did this happen?

JONAH

Mister Skin! That's even a better name

than ours!

MARTIN

Well, fuck me in the beard.

JASON

Dude, they got the top ten group

shower scenes! Why didn't you think of

that, Jay!

JAY

Don't put this on me!

BEN

God damn it!

MARTIN

Well shit. I saw it online at one

point, but I guess I didn't connect

the dots.

JONAH

What are we gonna do now?

BEN

All we need to do is think of a new,

better idea that no one else has

thought of already.

JASON

"Spiderman Three" starts in eight

minutes.

KNOCKED UP - 72.

JONAH

Shit. Don't worry. We'll figure it

out.

BEN

You know what? Just because this site

exists doesn't mean ours won't work.

Good things come in pairs.

JAY

For sure.

BEN

"Volcano," "Dante's Peak." "Deep

Impact," "Armageddon." "Wyatt Earp,"

"Tombstone."

JAY

Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.

BEN

Exactly. We can work together. This

helps us, if anything.

JAY

We're golden.

BEN

Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you

pictured it being exactly and it's not

how I wanted it. That is why I'm

presenting you with this empty box.

It's a promise, Alison. A promise that

one day I will fill this with a ring

that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I

can't afford it yet. I've picked it

out, though. It's at De Beers and it's

really nice. So, basically, I'm asking

you, will you marry me? Because I'm in

love with you.

ALISON

I love you too.

BEN

Really? That's so nice to hear. That's

the first time a girl's ever said that

to me.

ALISON

But here's the thing.

KNOCKED UP - 73.

BEN

There's a thing?

ALISON

I don't really know yet what that love

means. It's so new and it's so

exciting. It's great. I don't know.

We've only known each other for

seventeen weeks.

BEN

Look, I thought you felt weird that

we're having a baby and we're not

engaged. I'm going to get off my knee.

It hurts.

ALISON

I'm okay with that. We're just doing

what we can. I don't want us to put

any more pressure on ourselves than we

have.

BEN

That makes sense.

ALISON

I didn't hurt your feelings, did I?

BEN

No. I just wanted to do right by you.

If you don't want to, that's totally

cool.

ALISON

I really do love you.

BEN

I know. Thanks. You mentioned that.

It's nice.

ALISON

Ben proposed to me. He did. It was

really sweet. I feel a little bad. He

was wearing this great button-down. He

tucked it in. He got down on one knee.

He didn't have an actual ring, though,

just an empty box but he had this

whole spiel about when he has the

money, he'll buy me the ring I

deserve.

DEBBIE

The box was empty?

ALISON

He can't afford a ring.

KNOCKED UP - 74.

DEBBIE

So he got down on one knee and gave

you an empty box?

ALISON

Yes.

DEBBIE

I'm sorry.

ALISON

Get over it. If you'd been there, you

would have cried.

DEBBIE

You need to train him. Oprah said that

when two people meet they should point

out each other's differences and

flaws.

ALISON

I thought you should love people for

who they are.

DEBBIE

You criticize them a lot, so they get

so down on themselves they have to

change.

ALISON

You don't think that's naggy?

DEBBIE

In the end, they thank you for it.

DEBBIE

You can't commit to him. You don't

even know him. I don't even know Pete

after ten years. I don't know what

he's up to. He's miserable.

ALISON

Why do you say that?

DEBBIE

I think he's cheating on me. He's

always going to business meetings at

odd hours. Then I try to call him on

his cell phone and he says he's in bad

cell phone reception areas when he's

in good reception areas.

ALISON

Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's

trying to sign a new band. I can't

imagine Pete doing that.

DEBBIE

There's no part of you that thinks

maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?

KNOCKED UP - 75.

ALISON

No.

DEBBIE

I think he might be.

DEBBIE

"Memory Spy Web Memory Software.

Locate history, files, websites

visited, hidden downloads, e-mail

history. Memory Spy." Let's see you

hide from me now, little man.

PETE

You're not going to tell them?

ALISON

No. I don't have to. It's illegal for

them to fire me over it. And I get

three months maternity leave if I

stay. So I'm not going to tell them.

DEBBIE

Good plan.

PETE

I like it.

BEN

It's a good plan until her water

breaks over Robert De Niro's shoes.

(impersonating Robert De

NIRO)

My shoes. There's baby goo on them.

PETE

(impersonating Robert De

NIRO)

These shoes? On these shoes? Did you

puke on my shoes?

BEN

(impersonating Robert De

NIRO)

Is your water on my shoes?

KNOCKED UP - 76.

PETE

(back as Pete)

Isn't it weird, though, when you have

a kid and all your dreams and hopes go

right out the window.

DEBBIE

What changed for you? What went out

the window? You do everything exactly

the same.

PETE

No, I love what I'm doing. But say

before you're married with children

you want to live in India for a year.

You can do it.

DEBBIE

You want to go to India? Go to India!

Seriously.

PETE

Do you want to go to India?

DEBBIE

No. You can go.

BEN

I get what he means. Honestly, when I

found out about...

BEN (CONT'D)

...I had this flash of me in a white

Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada.

The chopper's taping it, and I bust

through the border and I'm free! I

kept thinking that.

BEN (CONT'D)

It was a flash!

ALISON

What do you mean?

BEN

Don't look at me. We can talk about

our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched

up to you in the DeLorean and said,

"Alison, I got the car here. What do

you want to do?" No part of you would

think, "Maybe I'll go back to that

night and put a condom on Ben's dick?"

You never got that flash?

ALISON

No. What are you talking about?

PETE

"Where we're going, we don't need

roads."

KNOCKED UP - 77.

BEN

You wouldn't do that?

ALISON

I don't know who Doc Brown is. What

are you talking about?

BEN

Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He

invented the DeLorean time machine.

PETE

Everyone has a time machine image.

DEBBIE

I have a really good idea. Why don't

you two get in your time machine, go

back in time and fuck each other?

PETE

Who needs a time machine?

BEN

This is my time machine!

PETE

(TO BEN)

I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun

it to 88.

BEN

(TO PETE)

You are a funny motherfucker, man.

(TO DEBBIE)

How can you fight with him? I just

want to kiss his face. He's cute.

PETE

(TO BEN)

I like the way you move.

BEN

This is fun! We should do this more.

This is the most fun I've had in a

really long time.

ALISON

Come on, harder.

BEN

I can't.

KNOCKED UP - 78.

ALISON

Why? Just do it deeper.

BEN

I can't.

ALISON

Why?

BEN

I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.

ALISON

Just do it!

BEN

Please don't yell at me.

ALISON

The doctor and Debbie said it's fine.

Come on!

BEN

I'm sorry, can we change positions?

I'm going to crush the baby.

ALISON

That's ridiculous!

BEN

No, it's not. It has no shell.

ALISON

Millions of people have sex when

they're pregnant! It just works!

BEN

I weigh over 200 pounds.

ALISON

Just get over it.

BEN

I can't do it. Can you just get on

top? All I can see if our baby, poked

in the face by my penis.

ALISON

Trust me, you're not even close. Okay,

fine.

ALISON (CONT'D)

I can't do this. I can't focus like

this. I look disgusting from this

angle. I can feel you looking at my

chins.

BEN

You look beautiful. Your chin looks so

skinny.

KNOCKED UP - 79.

ALISON

And my boobs are all like, squishy and

they're flopping around. I can feel it

and it's distracting. It's all

National Geographic.

BEN

(WHISPERING)

Do you want to do it doggie style?

ALISON

No. I do not want you to fuck me like

a dog.

BEN

I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's

doggie style. It's just the style.

I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't

have to go outside or anything.

BEN (CONT'D)

Here we go. Is it good?

ALISON

Yeah.

BEN

Should I go slower?

ALISON

Harder.

BEN

Just tell me when you're close.

ALISON

Just go harder.

BEN

Okay.

ALISON

Keep going!

BEN

Oh, God. Oh, fuck!

ALISON

What happened?

BEN

The baby. It kicked my hand.

ALISON

It always kicks.

BEN

No, no, no, no, no.

KNOCKED UP - 80.

ALISON

It's fine.

BEN

Not like this. No, this was a warning

kick.

ALISON

Just keep going.

BEN

This was a bad kick.

ALISON

It's fine! It's fine!

BEN

Look. My dick must be like an inch

away from its face and it's coming,

just coming in at its face. What if it

kicked because it didn't like it? I

can't do that to our baby. That's the

first thing it's going to see.

ALISON

What are you talking about?

BEN

It's having the baby between us, it

just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It

just freaks me out a bit. It's a

little weird.

ALISON

I have totally lost it now.

BEN

You've totally lost it?

ALISON

I've lost it.

BEN

Okay.

ALISON

Great, you know what? Just forget it.

ALISON (CONT'D)

(holding back tears)

Don't worry. I won't make you do this

again.

BEN

Shit.

KNOCKED UP - 81.

ALISON

Ben?

BEN

Fuck me.

JAY

Oh my God! It's the Russians.

MARTIN

Jodi! I'll protect you!

ALISON

Ben!

BEN

Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no!

JAY

That was horrible! That was so

horrible.

JASON

You're fine, man.

JAY

When will it be light out?

JASON

Take it easy.

JAY

When will it be light out?

JASON

Did anybody turn off the gas?

MARTIN

I didn't do it.

KNOCKED UP - 82.

JASON

Oh, motherfucker.

JONAH

Martin, this is my friend, Alex. She's

a pretty incredible person.

MARTIN

Nice to meet you.

JONAH

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude! Not cool,

Martin.

MARTIN

That's, that wasn't...

JONAH

Hey, are you serious, Howard Hughes?

JODI

What happened?

MARTIN

Nothing. Nothing happened. Come on.

ALISON

(TO BEN)

Where were you?

BEN

Look, I forgot you were sleeping over.

I'm sorry okay?

ALISON

Yeah, because you were getting high

off your huge bong. How am I supposed

to be comfortable with the idea that

you can take care of me and the baby

if you are always getting high?

BEN

You want me to stop smoking pot

because there's an earthquake once

every ten years? That makes no sense,

Alison. You're being irrational. Just

relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the

cops.

BEN (CONT'D)

California. Hey!

KNOCKED UP - 83.

BEN

You know it's times like this I'm glad

I don't own nice things. It's a big

mess, but there's only like fifty

bucks worth of shit here. That's kind

of the good thing. You know, my dad

told me, "Don't move to Northridge."

But you figure, what are the chances

of that happening twice, you know?

ALISON

What is this?

BEN

It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place

doesn't get condemned. That would

suck.

BEN

Hello?

ALISON

Hey it's me.

INTERCUT:

BEN

You!

ALISON

Hi! So, listen. Will you do me a big

favor? Debbie wants us to come over

and have dinner tonight. She thinks

Pete is cheating on her.

KNOCKED UP - 84.

BEN

Really?

ALISON

Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails

and there's an address. Ugh.

BEN

Oh, man. I don't want to do that.

ALISON

Ben, come on.

BEN

He's not cheating on her.

ALISON

How do you know?

BEN

I just know.

ALISON

Are you sure?

BEN

I'm one hundred percent sure he's not

cheating.

ALISON

Are you really?

BEN

No. It actually kind of makes sense

that he would cheat.

ALISON

Why?

BEN

Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and

Pete's awesome?

ALISON

Well, why don't you just come over

then, and, we'll just diffuse the

situation a little?

PETE

I'm just saying the music industry is

different now. Steely Dan would never

even have a chance.

BEN

Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan

gargles my balls.

PETE

They're incredible.

KNOCKED UP - 85.

BEN

They really aren't good, man.

PETE

Old Steely Dan.

BEN

If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want

you to slice my head off with an Al

Jarreau LP.

PETE

I should get going. I'm supposed to

see this band tonight in Hollywood.

Actually, they're playing in Laurel

Canyon, so I'll call you because the

reception's terrible over there.

BEN

That's true.

PETE

And I don't want you to worry. I'm

just going to jump in the shower. It

would be terrible if I smelled worse

than the band.

DEBBIE

Okay. Have fun.

BEN

You guys are crazy. He's acting

totally normal and hilarious.

BEN

(TO ALISON)

She doesn't have a gun, does she?

ALISON

No. I don't think so.

BEN

Oh, great.

BEN

Looks like no one's home.

DEBBIE

Why was the door unlocked? Wait here.

KNOCKED UP - 86.

BEN

I just feel bad for Pete.

ALISON

What?

BEN

I feel like this isn't a good way to

get caught cheating, it shouldn't be

like this.

ALISON

Well, maybe he should have thought of

that before he was cheating.

BEN

(through a fake cough)

Pete!

ALISON

Stop it.

BEN

I coughed. What do you want from me?

DEBBIE

There's nobody up there.

BEN

Thank you.

DEBBIE

I guess I was wrong.

BEN

I told you. Can we get out of here,

please?

ALISON

Yeah, come on. Let's go.

DEBBIE

Did you hear that?

ALISON

What?

BEN

I didn't hear anything.

ALISON

Come on.

FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1

Ten seconds.

KNOCKED UP - 87.

PETE

Carlos Delgado.

FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2

Excellent choice. Too bad I got him

three rounds ago.

FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1

You're still on the clock.

PETE

Oh shit!

FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1

You gotta do something. We need a name

here.

PETE

Hideki Matsui.

FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1

Ugh, you just took my whole outfield.

PETE

Sorry, Charlie.

DEBBIE

What is this?

PETE

Debbie.

DEBBIE

What the fuck is this?

PETE

It's our fantasy baseball draft.

FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2

We said no wives.

DEBBIE

Your fantasy what?

PETE

It's, it's our draft...for fantasy

baseball. I told you all about this.

Got Matsui.

PETE (CONT'D)

Aw, shit.

FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2

Hey, Pete, don't let the door hit you

KNOCKED UP - 89.

DEBBIE

Well, what did you do last Wednesday

night when you said you went to see a

band?

PETE

I went to the movies.

DEBBIE

With who?

PETE

By myself.

DEBBIE

What'd you see?

PETE

"Spiderman Three."

DEBBIE

Why do you want to go by yourself? Why

didn't you ask me to go?

PETE

Because I needed to get away, you

know? With work and you and the kids,

sometimes I just need some time to

myself.

DEBBIE

I need time for myself. I want time

for myself, too.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

You're not the only one.

PETE

It's not that big of a deal.

DEBBIE

(THROUGH TEARS)

I like Spiderman.

PETE

Okay, so let's see "Spiderman Three"

next week.

DEBBIE

I don't want to go see it now.

PETE

Well...

DEBBIE

I don't want to have to ask you to ask

me. I want you to just come up with it

on your own.

PETE

What? I don't even know what to say.

Uh, what do you want me to do?

KNOCKED UP - 90.

DEBBIE

You just think because you don't yell

that you're not mean, but this is

mean.

PETE

I'm not being mean. I'm being honest.

You're telling me I need to be honest.

JUST--

DEBBIE

No, you're not. You're lying.

PETE

I'm doing it because I need to keep my

sanity a little bit.

DEBBIE

You know what? I don't want you at the

house anymore. Okay?

PETE

Come on.

BEN

Oh, shit, she's coming back.

BEN

How come we go to the gynecologist so

often? I bet we have to go so much so

we can pay for that three-hundred-

thousand-dollar machine he has.

ALISON

I cannot stop thinking about what an

asshole Pete is.

BEN

That's a little strong, I would say.

ALISON

Really? Because that had to be one of

the most selfish things I've ever

witnessed.

BEN

It's understandable. I even think it's

kind of funny.

ALISON

What's funny about it?

BEN

Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't

imagine, but you know, the situation.

BEN

You've sacrificed your vagina?

ALISON

Yes! It will never look the same after

this!

BEN

Well. Fine. I'll pay for vaginal

reconstructive surgery.

ALISON

You can't pay for shit! You can barely

buy spaghetti.

BEN

You're right. Fine!

ALISON

You know what? Get out of the car.

BEN

Oh! You know what? Why don't you not

threaten me?!

ALISON

You should just get out of the fucking

car.

BEN

I'm not going to get out of the car in

the middle of nowhere! No!

ALISON

Get out of the car.

BEN

No!

ALISON

I own this car! Get out of my car!

No.

Get out of my car!

No.

Get out of my fucking car!

Can you let me back in the car,

take a breath? I have no clue where we

Fine. Go. Great.

ALISON

You know what? Maybe I should take my

shoes off. Or my belt buckle. My belt

buckle's huge.

DR. HOWARD'S NURSE

Don't worry about gaining weight. Your

baby wants you to gain a whole mess of

weight.

ALISON

(TO BEN)

Are you fucking kidding me?

BEN

Why don't you take off your earrings,

too? They weigh about eighty pounds.

They're made out of moon rocks aren't

they?

ALISON

Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am

hormonal, I am terrified, and I am

falling apart, so stop treating

everything like it's a big joke!

BEN

I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I

just walked three fucking miles

through Koreatown to get here. Sorry

if I'm trying to lighten the mood a

little.

ALISON

Well, don't! Okay?! You can't take

anything seriously! You didn't even

read the baby books.

BEN

I didn't read the baby books! What's

gonna happen? How did anyone ever give

birth without a baby book?!

(MORE)

KNOCKED UP - 94.

BEN (CONT'D)

That's right, the ancient Egyptians

fucking engraved "What to Expect When

You're Expecting" on the pyramid

walls! I forgot about that! Who gives

a flying fuck about the baby books?!

ALISON

It just shows your lack of commitment,

Ben! That you're not in this with me!

BEN

Did you just say my lack of

commitment? Because that's what it

sounded like. It almost seems as

though you forgot I proposed to you

like an asshole! And you said no to

me!

ALISON

If you feel that way, you should just

go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't

mean to do this together, okay? And,

and we tried to make it work and that

was good, I suppose.

ALISON (CONT'D)

But it doesn't work. Because we are

two completely different people. And I

think it would just be easier for both

of us if we stop fooling ourselves.

BEN

You know what? I know this isn't you

talking, it's your hormones, but I

would just like to say, "Fuck you,

hormones! You are a crazy bitch,

hormones! Not Alison! Hormones!" Fuck

them. It's a girl. Buy some pink shit!

ALISON

Nice. You are such an asshole. You

know what? Go fuck your fucking bong,

you fuck!

BEN

I will fuck my bong. Doggie-style, for

once.

DR. HOWARD'S NURSE

Are you ready?

ALISON

I'm really sorry about all that. That

was really inappropriate.

DR. HOWARD'S NURSE

That's okay. It happens all the time

here. It's fine.

KNOCKED UP - 95.

ALISON

I don't feel so stupid, then.

DR. HOWARD'S NURSE

Not at all.

BEN

I totally know what you're talking

about, man. If I wrote out the list of

shit Alison doesn't let me do it would

be endless. Don't smoke pot. Don't

have samurai swords in your room.

Don't have illegal grow operations in

the house. I could go on all fucking

day. Have I told her to stop doing

anything ever? No.

PETE

Marriage is like that show "Everybody

Loves Raymond," but it's not funny.

All the problems are the same, but

it's... Instead of all the funny,

pithy dialogue, everybody's just

really pissed off and tense. Marriage

is like an unfunny, tense version of

"Everybody Loves Raymond," but it

doesn't last twenty-two minutes. It

lasts forever.

BEN

Let's get out of here, man. Honestly,

let's just go. Let's go to Vegas.

PETE

Let's do it.

BEN

Yeah.

PETE

Why not?

DEBBIE

Get up.

ALISON

What?

KNOCKED UP - 96.

DEBBIE

We're not going to do this. Seriously.

ALISON

What are you doing?

DEBBIE

We have to do something! And have fun!

ALISON

I'm just so tired.

DEBBIE

I know you're tired. But we're going

to be untired! We're going to go live!

ALISON

Ugh. I hate you so much sometimes.

DEBBIE

We're going to be positive.

ALISON

How many Red Bulls have you had?

DEBBIE

I've had about three Red Bulls in the

last fifteen minutes. And I feel

fabulous! We're going to create a new

life and it's going to be awesome!

Let's go!

BEN

Since when do we lock this fucking

thing? Come on!

JASON

Yo. We can't go, dude. Sorry.

BEN

Holy crap! What happened?

JONAH

We got pink eye.

BEN

What? You giving each other butterfly

kisses or something?

JASON

Very funny. That's not how you get

pink eye. You get it from poo

particles making their way into your

ocular cavities.

KNOCKED UP - 97.

JAY

Hey, Ben.

BEN

Yo.

JAY

How's it going? I farted on Jason's

pillow as a practical joke. He farted

on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And

then eventually pink-eyes my pillow.

I'm not proud of this. But, I think

we've all forgiven each other. But, we

can't go anywhere.

PETE

You can get pink eye from farting in a

pillow?

JONAH

Totally.

PETE

That's awesome.

JONAH

Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed.

BEN

Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did

someone take a dump right in your eye?

MARTIN

No. No pink eye for me. I'm just

really...high.

BEN

Well stay back, guys. I got to get my

suit.

JASON

(TO PETE)

Are you Debbie's husband?

PETE

Yeah.

BEN

This is fun!

KNOCKED UP - 98.

PETE

This is great. We're going to have the

best time ever.

BEN

We make a good team, man.

PETE

Yep. It's like I can't come here with

Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's

like she wants to hold me in, and she

was telling Alison she could train

you.

BEN

She thinks she could train me?

PETE

Yeah, like you're running the Triple

Crown.

BEN

She can't train this! I'm like

Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think

I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking

face off.

PETE

That's right.

BEN

In front of a crowd, baby.

PETE

This is better. Besides I don't know

if I have enough of these babies to go

around.

BEN

Oh, my God. Are these mushrooms?

PETE

I got them from a roadie for the Black

Crowes.

BEN

I'm eating them.

PETE

Oh, no, save it! I got tickets to

Cirque du Soleil.

BEN

You do?! No you don't.

PETE

I swear to God, man.

BEN

Holy shit!

PETE

I see the beam of light.

KNOCKED UP - 99.

BEN

There it is, baby.

PETE

Woo-hoo. You're so money that you

don't even know how much money you

have.

BEN

I love Vegas, man.

PETE

This is the greatest place on earth.

BEN

It's really amazing here.

PETE

Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome.

BEN

Now that's how you get pink eye.

DOORMAN

(to the Two Pretty Girls)

Hey, what's up, baby girl?

DEBBIE

Hi.

DOORMAN

What's up? End of the line, please.

DEBBIE

Really?

DOORMAN

Yeah.

DEBBIE

Oh, come on.

DOORMAN

Look, we're at capacity, okay? We'll

let some people in when it clears out

a little. You'll get right in if you

go back to the end of the line.

KNOCKED UP - 100.

DEBBIE

We come here all the time. It's not a

big deal. It doesn't really look that

crowded in there.

DOORMAN

Hey, look, I don't make the rules.

DEBBIE

Please?

DOORMAN

No.

DOORMAN (CONT'D)

Hey, what's up, shorty? What's up

pretty girls? See y'all when y'all get

out. Take care of yourself.

DEBBIE

What was that? What the fuck was that?

DOORMAN

It is what it is, sweetie. Now can you

step to the back, please?

ALISON

(TO DEBBIE)

You know what? Maybe we should just

go.

DEBBIE

You don't need to call me sweetie.

DOORMAN

Yeah, but maybe you should listen to

your friend.

DEBBIE

No, you don't need to call me sweetie.

DOORMAN

All right, you want to come in, you're

going to have to go to the end of the

line and wait like everybody else.

DEBBIE

I'm not going to go to the end of the

fucking line. Who the fuck are you? I

have just as much of a right to be

here as any of these little skanky

girls! What, am I not skanky enough

for you?! You want me to hike up my

fucking skirt?! What the fuck is your

problem?! I'm not going anywhere!

You're just some `roided out freak

with a fucking clipboard. And your

stupid little fucking rope! You may

have power now, but you're not God.

You're a doorman! Okay? You're a

doorman! So...fuck you, you fucking

fag with your fucking little faggy

gloves.

KNOCKED UP - 101.

DOORMAN

Come here, come on.

DOORMAN

(WHISPERING)

I know. You're right. I'm so sorry. I

fucking hate this job. I don't want to

be the one to pass judgement and

decide who gets in. This shit makes me

sick to my stomach. I get the runs

from the stress. It's not because

you're not hot. I would love to tap

that ass. I would tear that ass up. I

can't let you in because you're old as

fuck...for this club, not, you know,

for the earth.

DEBBIE

What?

DOORMAN

You old. She pregnant. Can't have a

bunch of old, pregnant bitches running

around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed

to let in five percent black people.

He said that. Five percent. That mean

if there's twenty-five people here, I

get to let in one-and-a-quarter black

people. So I got to hope there's a

black midget in the crowd.

DEBBIE

Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.

DOORMAN

Why y'all want to be in here anyway?

Y'all need to be at a yoga class or

something.

(REGARDING ALISON)

What the fuck is she doing at the

club? That's not even good parenting

right there. Your old ass should know

better than that.

DEBBIE

Oh, God. Ugh.

BEN

Have the mushrooms kicked in yet?

KNOCKED UP - 102.

BEN AND PETE

Ohhhhhh!

BEN

This was a great idea, man.

PETE

This is the best idea I've ever had in

my life.

BEN

What are they going to do? What in the

world are they doing? If I shaved my

stomach and my chest, I would look

exactly like that. Those guys are at

work right now.

(imitating one of the

ACROBATS)

What'd you do today? Oh, just lifted

my brother.

BEN (CONT'D)

No! Don't applaud! He'll fall! I'm

freaking out right now, man!

BEN (CONT'D)

The mushrooms are turning on me!

GIANT BABY

Papa.

BEN

I am not your papa.

BEN (CONT'D)

I can't deal with this shit, man!

KNOCKED UP - 103.

DEBBIE

(WEEPING)

It's over.

ALISON

What's over?

DEBBIE

My youth.

ALISON

Don't say that.

DEBBIE

It's true. I just want to dance. I

love dancing.

ALISON

So dance.

DEBBIE

I can't dance. I'm embarrassed.

ALISON

I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking

whale and I'm trying to get into some

stupid club and--

DEBBIE

You look beautiful. You're young and

you're tall and you got the good lips

and boobs. I'm going to be alone.

ALISON

Debbie, no, you're not.

DEBBIE

Yes, I am. Oh, God! Fucking, men! I

get worse looking and he gets better

looking, and it's so fucking unfair.

Oh, fuck. We should go. My babysitter

always gets mad when we come home past

twelve. She's such a pissy little high-

school cunt.

STEVE MARTIN

(ON TV)

Let's move, gang! Come on, come on,

come on! Jessica, can you get these

plates and put them on the table,

please?!

KNOCKED UP - 104.

BEN

This isn't funny. That guy has twelve

kids. It's not funny. This is sick.

This is a sick movie. That's a lot of

responsibility to be joking about.

That's not funny. I got to turn this

off. It's freaking me out.

PETE

There are five different types of

chairs in this hotel room.

BEN

Holy fuck. What are they all doing in

here?

PETE

These are five different types of

chair.

BEN

Get them out of here, man. This is too

many chairs for one room.

PETE

There's a guy that works for this

hotel. His whole job is to find

chairs.

PETE (CONT'D)

Look at this one. Look at it. It's

gold and red and it's kind of shiny.

Shiny thread? Unbelievable. It is

beautiful, and it feels amazing.

BEN

The tall one's gawking at me and the

short one's being very droll. I don't

like them.

PETE

Oh, wow!

BEN

It's weird that chairs even exist when

you're not sitting on them.

PETE

I'm up high! I'm really high up.

BEN

I should've read the baby books.

PETE

Why didn't you read the baby books?

KNOCKED UP - 105.

BEN

Because then it's real, you know?

PETE

Dude, it's real whether or not you

read those books. That baby's coming.

PETE (CONT'D)

Oh, man!

BEN

Think they'll take us back?

PETE

Yes. But I don't know why. Do you ever

wonder how somebody could even like

you?

BEN

All the time, man. Like every day. I

wonder how you like me.

PETE

How can Debbie like me? She likes me.

I mean, she loves me. The biggest

problem in our marriage is that she

wants me around. She loves me so much

that she wants me around all the time.

That's our biggest problem. And I

can't even accept that? Uh, like that

upsets me?!

BEN

What?

PETE

She's the one. She loves me.

BEN

You can't believe...that people love

you? I love you, man! Debbie loves

you!

PETE

I don't think I can accept her love.

There's something wrong with me.

BEN

You can't accept love?

PETE

I don't know what it is.

BEN

Love? The most beautiful, shiny, warmy

thing in the world? You can't accept

it?

PETE

I have to go to this other chair.

KNOCKED UP - 106.

PETE (CONT'D)

Oh, this is a better energy.

BEN

You can't accept pure love? You can't

accept Debbie? She's chosen to give

you her life. She's picked you as her

life partner! But you play fantasy

baseball because you can't accept her

love?

BEN (CONT'D)

Ugh. I could accept it, man. And

Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and

she's funny and she smells good and

she's nice and her hair always looks

different. She's too good for you,

man.

PETE

Tastes like a rainbow.

BEN

You're disgusting. You're an urchin.

And she busts your balls because

you're a little bitch! You're a filthy

bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie

wants to give her life to you and

Alison doesn't want to do that with

me. And it makes me sad all day. I

want to go home.

PETE

(with fist in mouth)

I want to go home, too.

ALISON

Everything looks beautiful.

DEBBIE

Thanks. I went kind of overboard, huh?

ALISON

No, it's great.

DEBBIE

Your daughter only turns eight once.

Is Ben going to come?

KNOCKED UP - 107.

ALISON

I don't think so. I don't know why he

would.

BEN

Oh, hey, what up dog?

SADIE

Where have you been?

BEN

Around. You know, just kind of doing

my thing.

SADIE

Why is everybody so mad at you?

BEN

I don't know. Are they mad? What have

they been saying?

SADIE

They've been saying, like "blah-blah-

blah-blah. Ben's a prick."

BEN

They said that?

SADIE

A lot.

BEN

That sucks.

SADIE

What does it mean?

BEN

Penis. It means penis.

SADIE

Oh.

(CHUCKLING)

Penis.

PETE

Babe, we're running low on plates.

(TO BEN)

Hey Ben! What's up, man?

KNOCKED UP - 108.

BEN

What's happening, man?

DEBBIE

Hey, Ben.

BEN

Hey, Debbie.

DEBBIE

How are you?

BEN

Good. How are you?

DEBBIE

Hi.

(TO PETE)

Did you just get pink cupcakes or

yellow and pink cupcakes?

PETE

I just got yellow cupcakes.

DEBBIE

I thought I said to get pink cupcakes.

PETE

I can run out. I'll get some more.

DEBBIE

Nah, it's no big deal.

PETE

I don't mind.

DEBBIE

No it doesn't matter.

PETE

You sure?

DEBBIE

Yeah. You look really cute in that.

BEN

Well, that was fast, you pussy.

PETE

You're the one that got dressed up

like a cholo on Easter to come to this

party.

BEN

How are things at Butt-Fucking-Ham

Palace?

KNOCKED UP - 109.

PETE

You look like Babe Ruth's gay brother,

Gabe Ruth.

BEN

Well played, sir. That was good.

PETE

You going to talk to Alison?

BEN

Yeah, I was about to.

PETE

Right on.

BEN

It's a doll.

PETE

Thanks, Ben.

ALISON

I just don't think we can make it

work.

BEN

We can get back on track and

everything's going to be great.

ALISON

You're just being nice. And I'm being

nice and just because we're two nice

people doesn't mean we should stay

together. I don't want this baby to

determine the rest of our lives. You

know? Me not wanting to do this alone

isn't enough of a reason to drag you

into a relationship with me. It's just

not fair. And, and don't repeat this,

but, God, I don't want to end up like

Debbie.

BEN

But Debbie's happy.

ALISON

She's happy today. But every day is a

constant struggle for them because

they're not right for each other. You

know? And they have to force it and I

don't want us to have to do that. I

don't want to force you to be what I

think you should be. That's wrong of

me because you're great. You really

are. You're great the way you are and,

I mean, you like to get high and you

like to do shrooms in Vegas.

KNOCKED UP - 110.

BEN

I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.

ALISON

And who am I to stop you? Who am I to

tell you that that's wrong? It's not

wrong. It's who you are. It's what you

enjoy and that's your life and...

BEN

I'm not that guy anymore.

ALISON

We can be friends. And you can be

there when the baby is born, and in

the baby's life as much as you want. I

hope you will be.

BEN

If you give me a shot to just show you

that I'm con--

DEBBIE

Excuse me?

BEN

Oh, shit.

DEBBIE

(TO ALISON)

Can you grab the video camera? We're

going to sing "Happy Birthday" now.

ALISON

Yeah.

(TO BEN)

I'm sorry. I got to go. I'm sorry.

BEN

It's okay.

ALISON

I'll be right back. We'll finish

talking.

PETE

What happened?

BEN

Thanks for warning me, man. I just

walking into a fucking buzz saw! She

rejected me! Because you, for some

insane reason, told Debbie that I did

mushrooms with you in Vegas! She gets

mad because I smoke pot!

(MORE)

KNOCKED UP - 111.

BEN (CONT'D)

Now I'm upping it to fucking

psychedelics! Thanks!

PETE

Really? I thought that she'd take you

back.

BEN

You know why she just rejected me?

Because you're such a shitty husband,

she thinks I'm going to turn into a

shitty husband!

PETE

(SINGING)

"Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday

to you."

JESSICA ALBA

When are you due?

ALISON

I got two months.

JESSICA ALBA

Really? Wow. Well, you're so big

already.

ALISON

Yeah.

ANDY DICK

When is that baby popping out?

ALISON

I got two months to go.

ANDY DICK

Really? Are you dilated yet?

ALISON

Wow, wow.

EVA MENDES

You look fantastic.

ALISON

Thanks, thanks.

KNOCKED UP - 112.

EVA MENDES

Are you going to, like, give birth

right now?

STEVE CARELL

Wow! You're about to drop any second.

ALISON

You know what?

STEVE CARELL

I love your broach here.

ALISON

You don't need to lie to me. I don't

appreciate it. I know I look like a

fat cow. And I'm sweating profusely.

STEVE CARELL

No, you don't look like a...fat cow at

all. You look great. So, I have to get

going in. They're calling me.

ALISON

Steve, hey! Help me out. Give me an

interview, please.

STEVE CARELL

Well, I just need to run in.

ALISON

You know what? Just say into the

camera, "You're watching E!

Entertainment." Just give me that.

STEVE CARELL

Congratulations.

ALISON

No, Steve, don't be an asshole! Come

on.

STEVE CARELL

I'm not being an asshole.

BRENT

Wow. You managed to turn Steve Carell

into an asshole. No easy feat.

ALISON

Shut up, Brent.

KNOCKED UP - 113.

BEN

You screwed me, Dad, okay? You said

everything was going to be fine and

nothing is fine. Nothing is fine.

HARRIS (O.S.)

Ben, I've been divorced three times.

Why would you listen to me?

BEN

Because you were the only one giving

me advice! And it was, it was terrible

advice!

HARRIS (O.S.)

You can go around blaming everyone

else, but in the end, until you take

responsibility for yourself, none of

this is going to work out.

BEN

I don't know how to take

responsibility for myself, okay? I

didn't read the baby books!

HARRIS (O.S.)

You didn't read the books?

BEN

I should smoke less pot. I don't know

what to do! I'm an idiot! What, tell

me what to do!

HARRIS (O.S.)

I don't know. I don't know. Ben, I

love ya. What can I tell ya?

BEN

Just tell me what to do.

BOSS

Stone, you settling in okay?

BEN

Best job I ever had.

BOSS

Like to hear it.

KNOCKED UP - 114.

JACK

Alison, thank you for coming in. I

don't want to shock you, but know

what's under that jacket. You're

pregnant, have been for a while. From

my count, you're right around eight

months. And I don't know why you felt

you couldn't tell us.

ALISON

I'm really sorry.

JILL

This is Hollywood. We don't like

liars.

ALISON

I just wasn't expecting this and, I

didn't know how to handle it, and I

didn't want to lose my job. I'm really

sorry.

JACK

It's unfortunate that you didn't tell

us because you would've found out that

we thought it's great.

You know, it's a rare thing that you

live to see the day your wildest

dreams come true. I mean what is there

left to want? I get to go to Legoland.

DEBBIE

Shut up, Pete.

PETE

Say it!

ALISON

Legoland!

DEBBIE

Don't get them all riled up before the

drive.

PETE

I shouldn't have given them all that

meth then.

DEBBIE

We'll be back on Sunday.

PETE

Or Saturday. You never know. We might

see it all in one day.

DEBBIE

Sunday. Let's go.

ALISON

Ow, ow, ow.

BEN

Hello?

KNOCKED UP - 117.

JASON

Hey, what's up daddy? What are you

doing?

BEN

Just smoking a joint, drinking some

beers, you know. Rocking.

INTERCUT:

JASON

I think we're about to go to a new

club. You coming?

BEN

No. I'm going to pack it in soon.

JONAH

(TO JASON)

What's he doing?

JASON

(TO JONAH)

He says he's going to call it a night.

(TO BEN)

Dude, it's like eight-fifteen, man.

BEN

I know. I'm just tired.

JONAH

(TO JASON)

Is he depressed?

JASON

(TO BEN)

You depressed?

BEN

No, I feel great. I like it.

JASON

(TO JONAH)

He says no.

JONAH

(TO JASON)

Ask him if he's going to kill himself.

JASON

(TO BEN)

You going to kill yourself?

BEN

No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you.

KNOCKED UP - 118.

JONAH

(TO JASON)

Tell him not to jerk off with a noose

around his neck. It's dangerous.

JASON

(TO BEN)

You shouldn't jerk off with a noose

around your neck because it's

dangerous.

BEN

Okay, very good.

JONAH

(TO JASON)

Oh, and tell him if he has to, tell

him he needs a teammate or a spotter

there.

JASON

(TO BEN)

Right. And if you do, um, you should

have a teammate or a spotter there.

BEN

Great.

JASON

(TO JONAH)

He says your mom's already there.

JONAH

That's cool, man.

ALISON

(TO HERSELF)

Okay, okay, okay.

(into the phone)

Hi, Dr. Howard?

DR. ANGELO

No, this is Dr. Angelo. How can I help

you?

ALISON

I'm a patient of Dr. Howard's and I'm

going into labor and I need to speak

with him.

KNOCKED UP - 119.

INTERCUT:

DR. ANGELO

I actually don't know where he is

tonight. But I've made myself

available to his patients and I'd be

happy to help you.

ALISON

Can you help me find him? Can you give

me his number?

DR. ANGELO

Oh, no. You know what? Actually, I'm

under strict instructions not give out

his number, but I can help you through

this.

ALISON

No, no, no, no. I want to speak to my

own doctor. You really won't give me

his number? Because this is my first

baby and he promised that he would be

here for me and I need you to give me

his number, okay?

DR. ANGELO

Dr. Howard is not available tonight.

Bet everything's going to be okay, I

assure you.

ALISON

No, I don't want you to help me

because I have no idea who you are! I

want my own goddamned doctor! You make

sure he calls me!

ALISON (CONT'D)

(TO HERSELF)

Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, shit.

BEN

Hello?

BEN

(TO CAR)

Oh, don't run out of gas! Don't run

out of gas! Come on!

KNOCKED UP - 120.

BEN

Hello?

BEN

Please be in here. Hello? Hello!

BEN

Hello? Alison. Hello?

ALISON

Ben?

BEN

Alison. What is this, like a water

birth? What are we doing? Should we

go?

ALISON

Shh! Just relax, okay? Just be mellow,

because that's what this is all about.

Because if it gets too stressful in

here then the baby is born into a

stressful environment and then he's

wired for stress for the rest of his

life. So just...just be calm.

BEN

(WHISPERING)

Okay. Okay. Let's relax. Do you want

to talk about things? I feel really

bad about a lot of the shit I did. I

can't believe I said some of that.

That's all I think about in my head.

IT--

ALISON

I don't want to talk about it.

BEN

But maybe we could bring the baby into

a reconciled place so, we can talk--

KNOCKED UP - 121.

ALISON

No. I don't want to go there. Don't go

there, okay?

BEN

Okay.

ALISON

Help me stay relaxed.

BEN

So, what should I do?

ALISON

You need to call Dr. Howard.

MARIA

Hello?

BEN

Hello, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling

on behalf of Alison Scott. We need Dr.

Howard. It's an emergency.

MARIA

He's at San Francisco at Bar Mitzvah.

INTERCUT:

BEN

He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San

Francisco? Do you know when he gets

back?

MARIA

In three days.

BEN

Do you have his cell number, by any

chance?

BEN (CONT'D)

(TO ALISON)

Hey! Good news. I got his number right

here. I'm going to call him right now.

ALISON

Great. Thank you so much. I'm so glad

you're here. Thank you.

KNOCKED UP - 122.

BEN

I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you. I

shouldn't have told you you were a

fucking lunatic. I shouldn't have said

that. I feel terrible about it.

ALISON

No, it's okay. We're past it. I'm

sorry I told you to fuck your bong.

BEN

It's okay. I didn't

ALISON

Let's just drop it now. We're over it.

BEN

I'm going to call him right now.

You're doing so great.

DR. HOWARD (O.S.)

Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here

right now. Please leave a message.

BEN

(into the phone)

Hey, Doc Howard. Ben Stone calling.

Guess what the fuck's up? Alison's

going into labor and you are not

fucking here. Now, where are you?

You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San

Francisco, you motherfucking piece of

shit! And you know I'm going to have

to do now? I'm going to have to kill

you. I'm going to have to pop a cap in

your ass. You're dead! You're Tupac!

You are fucking Biggie, you piece of

shit! I hope you fucking die or drop

the fucking chair and kill that

fucking kid! Hope your plane crashes.

Peace, fucker!

ALISON

Hey.

BEN

Hey.

ALISON

Did you talk to him?

BEN

I didn't talk to him directly, I left

him a very nice message, though. What

I'm about to tell you isn't that bad.

You should know that going in. We can

get through this and it's just a

little hiccup, but everything will be

fine. Do you trust me when I say

everything will be fine?

KNOCKED UP - 123.

ALISON

BEN

ALISON

ALISON

BEN

KNOCKED UP - 124.

ALISON

Thank you.

BEN

You're welcome.

ALISON

Wait. Are we allowed to park here?

BEN

It's okay.

BEN (CONT'D)

I stole this from Martin's grandma.

ALISON

Oh. That was really sweet of you.

BEN

Thanks.

BEN

(TO ALISON)

We're close. Home stretch.

(to Female Nurse)

Hello. This is Alison Scott. Dr. Kuni

said he would let you know we were

coming?

FEMALE NURSE

He did. We'll take good care of you.

Samuel?

SAMUEL

Yeah?

FEMALE NURSE

This is Alison Scott. Please admit her

into room 307.

SAMUEL

All right. Hi.

BEN

You're our nurse?

SAMUEL

That's why I'm holding the clipboard.

So, uh, what else is up with you guys?

KNOCKED UP - 125.

SAMUEL (CONT'D)

I'm just joking. Let's have a baby!

SAMUEL

So, I'm sorry it took me so long to

find that vein. That little guy really

didn't want me to find him.

ALISON

Is that the baby on that one right

there?

SAMUEL

Yeah. That's how we can tell how the

little guy or gal is doing.

ALISON

Okay.

DR. KUNI

Hello, Alison, Ben. Interesting night.

BEN

We really, really appreciate you

coming, man.

DR. KUNI

What else do I have to do, I mean,

besides sleep? I was only kidding.

What happened to your doctor?

BEN

He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San

Francisco. He didn't tell us though.

DR. KUNI

Nice.

BEN

Yeah.

DR. KUNI

Lucky for you I don't have any Jewish

friends.

ALISON

Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this

naturally. I don't want to use drugs.

DR. KUNI

Let's just take a look and see what

happens, okay? Fetal heart rate is

good. Samuel, where are we?

KNOCKED UP - 126.

SAMUEL

Four centimeters.

DR. KUNI

Four centimeters what?

SAMUEL

Dilated.

DR. KUNI

Dilated. That's right. Focus. Pay

attention, okay? We're a team. Okay?

JONAH

I want to get the fuck out of here.

JAY

What?

JONAH

I just want to get the fuck out of

here.

JAY

Just relax, man, just relax.

JONAH

I don't fucking like hospitals.

JAY

Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think

you need to relax and embrace the

beauty of another life joining our

gang. We're having a baby. We are

having a baby.

JONAH

I'm not having shit besides a fucking

panic attack. There's probably a

fucking room back there full of dead

bodies! You guys want to be here when

one rolls out and just fucking coughs

malaria into our face?

JAY

Jesus.

JONAH

Fucking shit.

BEN

Is that good?

KNOCKED UP - 127.

ALISON

Oh, yeah, get in there.

BEN

I could do this all day.

ALISON

What was that?

BEN

What the hell was that?

BEN (CONT'D)

What's that, what's happening?

DR. KUNI

Well, boy and girls, what seems to be

the problem?

SAMUEL

Decels.

DR. KUNI

Oh, dear. Okay. Alison, I need you to

turn on your back now, okay? The

baby's heart rate is slowing. Okay?

BEN

It's going to be okay.

(to Dr. Kuni)

Is it going to be fine?

DR. KUNI

It's going to be fine. Okay?

(TO ALISON)

You're going to feel a little bit of a

push.

BEN

What are you doing?

DR. KUNI

I'm turning the baby so I can take the

pressure off the cord.

ALISON

Oh, my God.

KNOCKED UP - 128.

DR. KUNI

We're good. The heartbeat's stronger,

but we're not out of the woods. We

need to get things going now. I think

the cord is wrapped around the neck.

Okay?

BEN

What?

DR. KUNI

So I'm going to give you some

medicine, pop the bag and get things

going, okay? I don't want to leave the

baby in there for long and we can give

you some medicine for the pain.

ALISON

No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby

to be born all drugged out. It's not

my birth plan.

DR. KUNI

Now, things change. We don't have time

to debate this.

ALISON

What? No. But no, I'm not comfortable

with that. I'm not.

BEN

No. Would you please just listen to

her?

DR. KUNI

Fine. Do what you want to do.

BEN

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

DR. KUNI

Should I leave? Do you want to be the

doctor? Because I really don't need to

be here.

BEN

No. What we want is to take a second

to talk about our options, okay?

That's all we want.

DR. KUNI

No. You mean you want to take a second

to tell me how to do my job. My job is

to get that baby out safely. Or I can

go home! You just let me know. You be

the doctor.

BEN

Can we talk outside in the hall for a

second?

KNOCKED UP - 129.

DR. KUNI

That woman is a control freak, and she

needs to let go and let me do my job.

BEN

Look, she's just having a hard time

because her and her doctor had a very

specific birth plan. And they wanted

it to be a very special experience.

DR. KUNI

Okay. if you want a special

experience, go to a Jimmy Buffet

concert. We have a new birth plan: Get

the baby out safely.

BEN

Look, man, will you help us out? I

have no idea what I'm doing. You can

be as big a dick to me as you want.

Just be nice to her, man. That's all I

ask. Just please be nice to her.

DR. KUNI

Are you okay?

BEN

I think so.

DR. KUNI

I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.

BEN

Thank you, man.

DR. KUNI

This is healthy. This is good. I think

we're bonding.

DR. KUNI

Alison, I apologize for being a little

brash, but if you're okay with it,

it's rather important we break the bag

and give you some medicine to speed

things up. Because once the bag is

broken, I don't want there to be an

infection.

ALISON

Whatever. Do what you have to do.

ALISON (CONT'D)

(whispering to Ben)

Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy

is.

KNOCKED UP - 130.

BEN

I know, I know. Look, I talked to him.

I think he'll be more cool now.

ALISON

I'm so sorry I broke up with you.

BEN

You really don't need to be. And you

know, I knew you'd give me another

shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner

than this, you know?

ALISON

I was just in such a panic from all of

this. And watching Debbie and Pete

together, and my ass got so fat.

BEN

No, no.

ALISON

It did. I just never, for one minute,

thought that the guy who got me

pregnant would actually be the right

guy for me.

BEN

Me neither.

ALISON

I guess he is.

JONAH

All right, Martin, who am I?

(IMPERSONATING STEPHEN

HAWKING)

People think I'm smart because I speak

in a robot voice.

MARTIN

Stephen Hawking.

JONAH

(IMPERSONATING STEPHEN

HAWKING)

I fuck my nurse with my ever-expanding

cock.

(STOPS IMPERSONATION)

All right. Let's murderball. Come

here! I'm going to murderball you!

MARTIN

Oh, fuck.

KNOCKED UP - 131.

JONAH

Stay down!

MARTIN

Jonah, you shithead!

DEBBIE

Hi. I can't believe I go out of town

and this happens.

ALISON

I know.

DEBBIE

I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.

ALISON

Screw Legoland.

PETE

All right, how do you want this? You

want this over the shoulder? I can do

whatever you want. I can get in there.

Kind of Spike Lee angles.

ALISON

No, you can shoot the waiting room.

That would be great.

DEBBIE

(TO BEN)

Well, thank you. I've got it from

here.

ALISON

Debbie.

BEN

(TO DEBBIE)

Can I talk to you in the hall for a

second?

DEBBIE

Why?

BEN

I'd like to be in there with

Alison...without you.

DEBBIE

Okay. I understand how you feel, but

this isn't up to you.

KNOCKED UP - 132.

BEN

Look, Debbie, you are high off your

ass if you think you're coming into

that room. If you take one step

towards that door, I will tell

security there's a crazy chick in a

pink dress snatching up babies. Okay?

So don't even try to come into that

room. That's my room now. That little

area with the Pepsi machine...that's

your area. My room. Your area. Stay in

your area. Stay out of my room. Back

the fuck off.

PETE

What are you doing here?

DEBBIE

He just kicked me out. He told me to

leave. But I guess it's good, right?

He said he's going to take care of

her. He really seems on his game. I

think he's going to be a good dad. I

think I like him. Thank God.

PETE

I wish I'd gotten that on tape.

ALISON

Go! Holy shit, almighty! Oh, shit,

this really hurts!

DR. KUNI

Ah, I see we're well on our way.

ALISON

I want the epidural! Okay? Give me the

epidural!

BEN

Give it to her. Give her the epidural,

okay?

ALISON

Okay?

BEN

Give it to her now.

DR. KUNI

Alison, we're past the point of an

epidural. The cervix is fully dilated.

KNOCKED UP - 133.

ALISON

No, seriously, I want an epidural! I

know there's time!

DR. KUNI

We can't give you the epidural.

ALISON

Take the time! I'll make sure it

doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing.

BEN

We have time.

ALISON

I'll stop, oh, please, please, please!

BEN

Just do it, please!

DR. KUNI

I'm sorry. We have no time. We're

going to just have to do this the all

natural way, okay? The way you wanted

to do it. Okay? Ready?

ALISON

Okay.

DR. KUNI

Here comes another contraction, okay?

I want you to push. Okay, ready? Good,

good, good.

ALISON

I feel everything! Oh, my God! It's

happening.

SAMUEL

Maybe we can take it down just a

little. I think you're going to scare

the other pregnant women.

ALISON

Are you fucking kidding me? Are you

kidding me?

JAY

Jesus.

JONAH

Oh. This is messed up. Something's

wrong in there.

JASON

No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's

only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to

me like she's crowning. Is that right,

Deb?

KNOCKED UP - 134.

DEBBIE

Yeah. That's what it sounds like for

everyone. Everyone goes through this.

JAY

No, I disagree with you. That sounds

terrible. I'm going to go sneak a

peek, see if there's anything I can

do.

DR. KUNI

It's crowning! I'm seeing the head!

ALISON

Oh, God. Honey, what does it look

like, Ben?

BEN

Oh, God.

ALISON

What?

BEN

You don't want to see it. You don't

WANT--

ALISON

No, I want to see it!

BEN

It's beautiful. You don't want to,

though.

ALISON

No, I want to see...

ALISON (CONT'D)

...it! Oh, God! Oh, God!

DR. KUNI

Okay, we're almost home! One, two--

JAY

You okay in here?

KNOCKED UP - 135.

JAY (CONT'D)

Jesus!

ALISON

Get out!

JAY

Yeah, okay.

JASON

You all right, buddy?

JAY

One sec.

JONAH

What did it look like?

JAY

I shouldn't have gone in there. Don't

go in there. Promise me you don't go

in there.

JONAH

Me go in there? That's the last

fucking place I want to go. Like I'm

going to go in there. Try getting a

boner now.

JASON

What's up Deb?

DEBBIE

Hey.

DR. KUNI

Push. One, two, three.

ALISON

Oh, God!

DR. KUNI

You've passed the shoulders. One more

big push. Good.

KNOCKED UP - 136.

ALISON

Oh, Ben. I did it.

BEN

You did it.

ALISON

It's out.

BEN

You did it. Oh, my God, you did it.

ALISON

Hi, baby. I love you, Ben.

BEN

I love you so much, too. Oh, my God.

DR. KUNI

Congratulations, you two. Beautiful.

ALISON

Thank you.

DR. KUNI

You did so great. You were amazing.

ALISON

Pretty baby.

BEN

You got out. You made it out. Welcome.

MARTIN

You ever get so bored you just stare

at your balls?

JONAH

I bet you do, late John Lennon.

MARTIN

Here we go again.

DEBBIE

(whispering to Pete)

Who is that? Is that Ben's rabbi? Is

he the one who cuts the penis?

PETE

I think it's Matisyahu.

MARTIN

Awesome.

JASON

You want out of the bet?

MARTIN

I want out of the bet.

KNOCKED UP - 137.

JASON

You know what you have to say. Just

say it, man. I think now is the time.

MARTIN

"Jason, you're the master."

JASON

You heard it, right?

JAY

Yeah.

JASON

All right. You're out of the bet.

You're done.

JASON (CONT'D)

Your face smells like an old man's

balls.

MARTIN

Thank you.

DEBBIE

Oh, my God. Hello. My goodness. She's

beautiful. She's beautiful. I love

you, Ben.

BEN

I love you, Debbie.

DEBBIE

(TO PETE)

We're going to have another baby.

PETE

Okay.

DEBBIE

Hello, baby.

BEN

Gentlemen, it's a girl!

THE GUYS

Ohhhhhhh!

BEN

Yeah!

KNOCKED UP - 138.

JAY

We got a daughter! Mazel Tov!

JASON

Congratulations, Daddy!

JAY

We got a beautiful little girl!

BEN

Let's meet her! She's awesome.

JAY

A beautiful little girl!

JASON

Let's meet her. Aw.

BEN

(to the baby)

And then your mommy said, "Just do it,

already," which was very confusing to

Daddy. So I listened to the most

literal translation of that and I just

did it, already. What would you do?

Don't tell Mommy, but it was the

smartest thing I ever did, listening

to her, because now you're here. Isn't

that nice? I think it is.

ALISON

I hope your apartment's big enough for

the three of us.

BEN

It definitely is. That's why I got one

in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The

only thing is we have to decide if

we're going to be Crips or Bloods

before we get there.

ALISON

Well, I look good in red.

KNOCKED UP - 139.

BEN

I look good in blue. The fighting

continues. We could just throw off

everyone and become Latin Kings.

ALISON

Yeah.

BEN

We both look good in gold.

ALISON

Good choice. I would yell at you about

driving so slow, except the baby's

here.

BEN

No, these guys can honk all they want.

I ain't going faster than twelve. It

might take us around three hours to

get home, though.
