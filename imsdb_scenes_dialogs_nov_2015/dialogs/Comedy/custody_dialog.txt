CUSTODY

Eric Stuyvesant

FADE IN:

RICK

Helluva talent, that kid.

RICK

Probably be in the bigs in another

year.

CUT TO:

MELANIE

Zach? Are you ready? Mommy, can't

be late again.

CUT TO:

ZACH

I'm ready.

MELANIE

Come on baby. Don't do this to

mommy. Not today.

2.

ZACH

I don't want to go. Melanie hastily

dresses her son.

MELANIE

Zach, do you want mommy to get

fired?

ZACH

Yes.

MELANIE

If I get fired we won't have the

money to go to Six Flags. Zach

quickly dresses himself.

CUT TO:

RICK

Must be something to have that kind

of talent. He's just a kid,

nineteen, twenty tops, and if he

stays healthy and he stays focused,

the world is his oyster. Guys like

you and me, we squandered those

opportunities long ago.

JOHN

You.

RICK

Huh?

JOHN

Guys like you...

RICK

And me...

JOHN

... squandered opportunities. I, on

the other hand, knew where I was

going. I had that kind of drive, I

just never had the talent.

RICK

You knew where you were going?

3.

JOHN

Absolutely.

RICK

At nineteen?

JOHN

Without question.

RICK

The only thing I knew for certain

was that I would run to the corner

store every day for beer.

CUT TO:

MELANIE

Lock your door. I'll be right back.

Melanie opens her door.

ZACH

Mom?

MELANIE

What?

ZACH

I'm not thirteen. It's against the

law to leave me alone in a car

until I'm thirteen.

MELANIE

Come on.

CUT TO:

JOHN

I had priorities. I understood what

it meant to have an attention span.

4.

RICK

You could focus?

JOHN

I was the King of Focus.

RICK

The Duke of Diligence?

JOHN

The Count of Concentration.

RICK

Duck.

JOHN

Huh?

RICK

The Polestar Prince.

CUT TO:

MELANIE

Did you decide?

ZACH

I want Coke.

MELANIE

Get one.

ZACH

No, Pepsi.

(A beat)

No, Seven-Up. Maybe root beer.

MELANIE

Make up your mind already.

5.

ZACH

So many choices. A glance to her

watch.

CUT TO:

JOHN

I'm just saying grow up. You can't

keep drifting.

RICK

I thought I did grow up...

JOHN

When you got married?

RICK

Yeah...

JOHN

You matured a little.

RICK

It's a process.

JOHN

No Bueller, it's a decision. One

you need to make. You can't keep

running without direction. If you

don't know where you're going

you'll never get what you want.

CUT TO:

ZACH

I want Sobe.

MELANIE

Too bad.

6.

ZACH

I don't want Coke. I want Sobe.

MELANIE

(To clerk.)

We'll take the soda.

CLERK

Two dollars and...

MELANIE

Hold on a minute. Please?

CUSTOMER

Come on lady.

MELANIE

Get your Sobe.

CUT TO:

RICK

I thought I got direction...

JOHN

When Cindy had kids?

RICK

Yeah...

JOHN

They gave you purpose. But purpose,

my friend, is not direction.

RICK

East.

JOHN

Huh?

7.

RICK

My direction is east. I parked in

the deck.

JOHN

I'm right around the...

RICK

Corner?

JOHN

Yeah.

RICK

We're always going in different

directions.

JOHN

Mine are much more productive.

RICK

And much less adventurous.

JOHN

Well, I'm gonna...

RICK

Go?

JOHN

Yeah.

RICK

Then go.

JOHN

That's what I'm going to do.

Responsibility calls.

CUT TO:

ZACH

Sobe sucks. I want Coke.

CUT TO:

8.

JOHN

You want to...

RICK

Get a beer?

JOHN

Yeah.

RICK

Can't.

JOHN

Can't?

RICK

Gotta get home.

JOHN

Why?

RICK

Family, my man. Take time off for a

ballgame ya should probably tend to

the family too. You should try it

sometime.

JOHN

In the grand scheme of things

family is a liability, not an

asset. Rick continues on.

JOHN

(Calling out.)

Do you even know what you're doing

or where you're going?

RICK

(Yelling over his

shoulder.)

East.

JOHN

East leads nowhere, my friend. You

should be heading south. The bar is

south. East takes you places you

don't want to go.

9.

CUT TO:

BOSS

You're late.

MELANIE

I know, but...

BOSS

No buts. You're late.

MELANIE

But...

BOSS

It's the third time this week Mel.

You put me in a rough spot here. My

boss wants me to let you go. His

boss wants me to let you go. I

gotta let you go.

MELANIE

But...

BOSS

If a person isn't responsible

enough to be prompt to their job,

they're not responsible enough to

work for me.

MELANIE

But...

BOSS

You're fired Mel. Just get your

things and go.

BOSS

We still on for dinner?

CUT TO:

10.

OFFICER ONE

Is that...?

OFFICER TWO

You think...?

OFFICER ONE

Naw...

OFFICER TWO

Can't tell from here...

OFFICER ONE

Too far away. Let's roost him.

OFFICER TWO

Call it in.

CUT TO:

OFFICER TWO

It's him... get him, get him, get

him. They curb the car in front of

Rick.

OFFICER ONE

Get em up. Up I said... up.

RICK

Huh?

OFFICER TWO

Get `em where we can see `em

slimeball.

11.

OFFICER ONE

Oh, we got ourselves a litterbug

here.

RICK

What?

RICK

What's going...

OFFICER ONE

Shaddup!

OFFICER TWO

You know your rights, cretin, but

just in case you don't...

RICK

What the hell? Officer Two spins

Rick to face him.

OFFICER TWO

You have the right to shut the hell

up. Do you understand this right?

RICK

Yes.

OFFICER ONE

Shut him the hell up, Jimmy.

OFFICER TWO

If you don't shut the hell up my

partner might exercise his right to

shoot you. Do you understand?

OFFICER ONE

He's looking at me funny, Jimmy.

12.

OFFICER TWO

You have the right not to look at

my partner in any way that might be

construed as `funny' which could

result in harm to your person. Do

you understand this right?

OFFICER ONE

He twitching?

OFFICER TWO

Really? I don't think he is. Are

you twitching boy?

RICK

No Sir.

OFFICER ONE

Look at him, he's twitching.

Nothing pisses me off more than

twitching and talking. If he

doesn't stop I'm gonna waste him.

OFFICER TWO

You have the right not to twitch or

shiver or make any other odd

movements that might encourage my

partner to discharge his weapon, do

you understand?

CUT TO:

BOSS

You never answered about tonight.

MELANIE

You're making a huge mistake.

CUT TO:

13.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

What do we got here boys?

OFFICER TWO

It's him. We got him.

OFFICER ONE

He's a twitcher... a twitcher and a

talker. Boy, I tell you, if he'd

twitched one more time I would've

deposited large amounts of hot lead

in his ass.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

I'll take it from here boys.

OFFICER TWO

Report too?

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

No, that's your job.

OFFICER ONE

If we have to write the report I

say I get to shoot him.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

No one's getting shot today, Bobby.

OFFICER ONE

Can't I just wing him or something?

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Jimmy; get him out of here.

CUT TO:

MELANIE

Tell me I'm not responsible...

asshole. I have a kid. He has a

goldfish. I have my dignity.

(MOR E)

14.

MEL ANIE (cont'd)

He has a brown ring on his collar.

He's nothing more than a turd with

feet.

CUT TO:

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

You don't want to piss Bobby off.

He's a little unstable.

RICK

A little? He represents your force?

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Affirmative action. We have to hire

our fair share of disabled ---

Quota thing.

RICK

His psychosis doesn't appear

disabling.

CUT TO:

MELANIE

Where's Zach?

MRS. NELSON

Fired again?

MELANIE

I don't want to talk about it.

MRS. NELSON

The first thing I learned when I

retired was that time management is

an asset.

CUT TO:

15.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Take your time, Ma'am. We need you

to be certain.

LADY IN BLACK

Can I see their profiles?

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Turn to your left. The men follow

their instruction.

LADY IN BLACK

I just... I just don't know...

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Back to front.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

All of you face forward. The two

turn forward.

LADY IN BLACK

Number three...

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Are you sure?

LADY IN BLACK

Could you have him step forward?

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Number three take two steps

forward.

16.

LADY IN BLACK

That's him.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

You're positive?

LADY IN BLACK

I'm positive. That's the man that

needs to be in custody.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Okay number three step back. Rick

does as he's told.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Turn to your right --- all of

you...

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

...and exit.

DISSOLVE TO:

JUDGE

Order in the court.

JUDGE

Order in the court, I say.

17.

PROSECUTOR

Have a seat.

JUDGE

Do you know why you're here today,

Mr. Stevens?

RICK

Why am I here?

JUDGE

Are you being rhetorical?

RICK

Are you asking me?

JUDGE

You stand here today an accused

man.

RICK

Accused? Accused of what?

JUDGE

You have been placed in custody of

your children.

RICK

Huh?

PROSECUTOR

Your children, Mr. Stevens. You do

realize you have children, don't

you?

RICK

Yes, but...

PROSECUTOR

But nothing Mr. Stevens, either you

have children or you don't.

RICK

I do.

PROSECUTOR

So, you accept responsibility for

bringing young life into the world?

RICK

I guess...

18.

PROSECUTOR

PROSECUTOR

(MOR E)

19.

PRO SECUT OR (cont'd)

On top of that you told this court

that you accepted the

responsibility of having said

children, did you not?

RICK

Yes, but...

PROSECUTOR

Then why, Mr. Stevens, do you

continue to deny culpability in

this situation?

JUDGE

Answer the question.

AUDIENCE

Answer the question.

PROSECUTOR

The question, Mr. Stevens.

RICK

How can you be sure it was me?

PROSECUTOR

She picked you out of a lineup,

Sir. What more do you need?

RICK

Time.

PROSECUTOR

Time is not an option, Mr. Stevens.

Time --- is not --- an option.

PROSECUTOR

You don't deny being married to Ms.

Stevens, nor do you deny the act of

procreation. You seem to understand

that your actions bear consequence.

You seem to understand that with

parenthood, came responsibility.

(MOR E)

20.

PRO SECUT OR (cont'd)

It seems to me, as it should to

anyone with the capacity for simple

deduction that you, Mr. Stevens,

did willingly and knowingly enter

into the commitments of parenthood

fully aware of the potential

pratfalls. Did you not?

RICK

Yes, yes I did.

PROSECUTOR

It's time to pay the piper, Mr.

Stevens.

(To the Judge)

It is the recommendation of the

State that Richard C. Stevens been

sentenced to the fullest capacity

allowed by law.

RICK

What about Cindy?

PROSECUTOR

Excuse me?

RICK

My ex, Cindy, what about her

responsibilities to the children?

PROSECUTOR

She cut a deal, Rick. You were the

one we wanted. You were the one we

got. She took the plea. Sure, it

costs her financially. But what is

freedom worth?

JUDGE

I see no reason to extend this any

further. Mr. Stevens you have been

found competent by the State and by

this Court. You are completely

cognizant of your surroundings, and

you leave me no choice. This court

finds you guilty as charged.

RICK

Guilty of what?

21.

JUDGE

You are hereby remanded to custody

of your children for no less than a

lifetime. This Court is adjourned.

RICK

I can't do this alone. Don't make

me do this alone. I'll never make

it...

JUDGE

If you can't do the time, Mr.

Stevens, then don't do the crime.

CUT TO:

MELANIE

Highly Effective Strategies of Time

Management for the Single Parent?

MRS. NELSON

Learn it. Live it.

MELANIE

It was written by a man... a

married man.

MRS. NELSON

Lots of single parents are married.

NICHOLAS

RICK

23.

KRIS

What's she need time for?

RICK

To figure out who she is, where

she's going, what she wants.

NICHOLAS

I miss mommy.

RICK

She misses you too, baby. And this

isn't permanent... we're going to

fight this... we're going to

appeal. We'll take it to the

Supreme Court if we have to.

KRIS

You don't want us either?

RICK

Of course I want you. I just don't

think I should have to do this

alone.

JAILER

I feel for you, I really do, but

I've seen your kind before. You're

a lifer. Whether it's fair or not.

Whether justice was served. It

doesn't matter. You're here for the

duration.

CUT TO:

ZACH

What's wrong mommy?

MELANIE

Nothing.

24.

ZACH

Why are you crying? Did I do

something wrong?

MELANIE

Nothing at all baby.

ZACH

(Pulling a book from an

end table)

Tell me a story?

MELANIE

Once upon a time, a very long time

ago...

CUT TO:

JAILER

Get yourself cleaned up.

RICK

Huh?

JAILER

You have visitors... in the

courtyard.

FATHER

Quite the pickle you've got

yourself in.

RICK

So it seems.

25.

MOTHER

She was no good for you. I knew it

from the start.

RICK

Mom, don't... okay?

MOTHER

Just saying...

RICK

I know, but what's done is done.

FATHER

There's my boys.

MOTHER

You're dad and I are here for you.

RICK

I know mom.

MOTHER

Are you eating?

RICK

Yeah, I guess.

MOTHER

Do you need anything? Food? Money?

RICK

Watch the kids one night? I could

use some time to myself.

MOTHER

Um... Yeah... okay... I suppose

that would be all right... we'd

have to ask your father, but I

don't see why that would be a

problem.

(a beat)

Other than that everything's okay?

26.

RICK

We're okay...

MOTHER

Because it doesn't have to be like

this. Mary Ryan, a friend of mine,

her son had the same thing happen

to him. Wife just up and left with

no warning at all. He didn't waste

a day. No sir, he was up and at `em

almost instantly. You can leave

here, you know? Mary Ryan's son

did.

RICK

I like it here, mom.

MOTHER

What's to like? It's dingy and

filthy. It's no place to raise

children.

RICK

It's home and it's stable. The one

thing the boys need right now is

stability.

MOTHER

You can't keep hiding forever.

RICK

It's been five days, mom. I'm not

hiding. I just need time to adjust.

MOTHER

Mary Ryan's son thinks you're

hiding.

RICK

Do I know this guy?

MOTHER

No, but I think you should. I hate

that woman. How can a mother

abandon her kids? How could she do

this to my babies?

DISSOLVE TO:

27.

CINDY

Scott? Scott?

SCOTT

(Catching up)

Yeah baby?

MOTHER (VO)

I hope she's living in hell too.

CUT TO:

ZACH

What ya doing?

MELANIE

Looking for a job.

ZACH

I know what you could do.

MELANIE

What's that?

ZACH

You could stay home with me.

MELANIE

What do you pay?

ZACH

Sixty-five cents.

MELANIE

A day?

28.

ZACH

A week.

MELANIE

You can afford that?

ZACH

If it keeps my mommy home with me.

CUT TO:

FRANK

So, needless to say, I understand

your situation. My old lady, she

took off and left me with the kids

five years ago. That bitch. But I'm

not bitter or anything. I found me

a good day care and moved on with

my life. You should too.

RICK

It's hard...

FRANK

Of course it's hard, sometimes

feels like you're in prison, but

you gotta be a man... stand up for

yourself... provide for your

family.

RICK

And you can help?

FRANK

Me? I'll put ya to work. Some long

hours, but it all pays off. Keeps

you off the welfare system if ya

know what I mean.

RICK

Yeah.

FRANK

I'd rather pay you than pay the

government to pay you. You can

start Monday.

29.

FRANK

Here's the number to the day-care.

Tell them you know me, they'll cut

you a break.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MS. HEATH

And when school starts we have a

bus service that will take the two

oldest to and from school. We have

story hour at Eleven, lunch at

noon, and nap time at Twelve-

thirty. Rest assured our programs

are designed to be nurturing,

caring environments that provide

the parental guidance your children

need in those hours you can't be

with them. So, are there any

questions?

RICK

No, you seemed to cover everything.

Ms. Heath bends down to the kid's

level.

MS. HEATH

You're going to like it here.

KRIS AND PHILLIP

No, daddy, don't leave us here.

MS. HEATH

(Reassuringly)

They'll be just fine.

30.

CUT TO:

FIRST INTERVIEWER

I'm sorry. It would be really nice

to have you on board, but you're

just a little too qualified.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SECOND INTERVIEWER

Too Qualified.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

31.

THIRD INTERVIEWER

Over qualified.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FOURTH INTERVIEWER

You're just not qualified.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FIFTH INTERVIEWER

I don't think I've seen such a

perfect candidate.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

32.

MELANIE

Really?

PROVIDER

You are bad, bad children.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FIFTH INTERVIEWER

Education level. Work experience.

You really fit the billet.

CUT TO:

RICK

So, did everything go okay?

PROVIDER

They were angels.

RICK

Did you have fun boys?

CUT TO:

33.

CUT TO:

RICK

Get those seat belts on. The kids

reluctantly comply.

RICK

So, how was your day?

RICK

Didn't they feed you? They said

they would feed you. The brochure

said meals provided.

KRIS

We didn't eat nuffin.

PHILLIP

Daddy, I'm hungry.

CUT TO:

FIFTH INTERVIEWER

Unfortunately we filled the

position earlier today. WHIP PAN to

cell doors slamming closed.

CUT TO:

34.

CUT TO:

FRANK

So, how was your first week?

RICK

Thirteen hours a day doesn't leave

me much time for my kids, But a

job's a job, right?

FRANK

Now you're talking.

RICK

Two hundred and fifty bucks?

FRANK

Pretty good, huh?

RICK

Two-hundred-and-fifty-bucks?

FRANK

Don't spend it all in one place.

RICK

I give you sixty-five hours of my

time and you give me two hundred

fifty bucks?

FRANK

It's the American way. This country

was founded on low paying, back

breaking, long hour jobs. Why, work

like this makes you a bona fide

patriot. Ya gotta love it.

35.

RICK

(Mumbling as he EXITS)

What's not to love?

CUT TO:

MS. HEATH

That will be two hundred seventy-

five dollars and thirty-six cents.

RICK

I'm a little short.

MS. HEATH

We take checks too.

RICK

Checks?

MS. HEATH

Those things you use when you don't

have money.

RICK

I'm sorry, I'm clueless. My wife

handled the checks.

MS. HEATH

Ah.

RICK

Does it help that I know Frank

Ryan? He told me to mention his

name.

MS. HEATH

You know Frank?

RICK

I work for him.

36.

MS. HEATH

That changes everything.

RICK

Great.

MS. HEATH

Two hundred ninety-five dollars and

thirty-six cents.

RICK

Huh?

MS. HEATH

Frank owes me money and one way or

another, I will collect.

RICK

So, I'm forty-five dollars short...

MS. HEATH

And thirty-six cents. Don't worry

about it. It's your first week. You

didn't know, so, we'll let it ride

and just add it to next week's

balance. A beat as Rick turns to

leave.

MS. HEATH

You know there is a way you could

save quite a bit of money.

RICK

Really?

MS. HEATH

Potty train the toddler.

RICK

Potty train? Nicky?

MS. HEATH

(Handing Rick the

pamphlet)

The toddler.

CUT TO:

37.

ZACH

Mommy?

MELANIE

Yes, baby?

ZACH

When are we going to have a normal

life.

MELANIE

We do have a normal life... for us.

ZACH

I mean when are we going to be like

other people?

NICHOLAS

Big boy go potty.

RICK

Are you a big boy?

NICHOLAS

Huge-mong-gus.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

38.

RICK

Big boys go potty on the potty,

Nicholas. Nicholas go potty on the

potty?

RICK

You're brothers go potty on the

potty. Daddy goes potty on the

potty. Nicholas go potty on the

potty?

RICK (CONT'D)

Daddy will buy Nicky a toy from the

store.

NICHOLAS

Okay.

RICK

If Nicky goes potty on the potty.

NICHOLAS

I want a toy!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NICHOLAS

I have to go potty?

RICK

Really?

39.

NICHOLAS

All done.

CUT TO:

MS. HEATH

How's the potty training coming?

RICK

I think we're making progress.

MS. HEATH

Three hundred forty and...

RICK

Seventy-two cents. Here's two-

fifty.

MS. HEATH

You're still short.

RICK

I know and I'm working on that.

MS. HEATH

May I remind you that we're not a

charity? If you need credit go to a

bank. I run a reputable business

and I need the balance by next

Wednesday, or maybe you should

consider other arrangements.

KRIS

I didn't do it.

CUT TO:

MOTHER

What happened? Where is he? Is he

going to be okay?

40.

RICK

He's going to be fine. They're

working on him now. From what they

told me it's just a few stitches.

FATHER

Boys will be boys. A NURSE peeks

out.

NURSE

Mr. Stevens can you come back? The

doctor could use your help in

calming the child down.

RICK

Mom?

MOTHER

Just go. I'll watch these two.

CUT TO:

DOCTOR

Thank God.

RICK

How can I help?

DOCTOR

Well, I need to give him a local so

that I can sew the laceration, but

he's not cooperating. Maybe hold

his hand and distract him?

RICK

Hi little buddy.

PHILLIP

Hi Daddy.

RICK

I need you to be a good boy, okay?

PHILLIP

Okay daddy.

41.

RICK

So, did you have fun today.

PHILLIP

Uh huh.

RICK

Did you play with all your friends?

PHILLIP

Uh huh.

PHILLIP

That fuckin' hurts!

RICK

Phillip!

PHILLIP

But daddy, it does.

RICK

That's a big people word. You're a

little people, and little people

don't use big people words.

PHILLIP

Okay.

RICK

(To Doctor)

I'm sorry.

PHILLIP

Do that again and my daddy's going

to kick your ass.

CUT TO:

RICK

Look I'm really sorry.

42.

DOCTOR

Can I ask you something?

RICK

Sure, I guess.

DOCTOR

My son's a wuss. He cries over

hangnails. My wife and I have tried

everything to toughen him up, but

nothing works. I was wondering if

our kids could play together. Maybe

some of Phillip's "boy" would rub

off on Junior.

CUT TO:

RICK

Insurance?

RECEPTIONIST

Yeah, Insurance. That thing that

covers medical emergencies?

RICK

I don't think I have any.

RECEPTIONIST

Everybody has insurance.

RICK

I don't think I do.

RECEPTIONIST

Okay.

RICK

Can I run a tab?

43.

RECEPTIONIST

You don't have a check?

CUT TO:

RICK

I'm not even responsible for

myself. How am I suppose to raise

three kids?

MOTHER

It can be done.

RICK

I don't see how.

MOTHER

Find a way. Everything happens for

a reason. God doesn't abandon his

children, and neither will you.

RICK

God doesn't pay day-care.

MOTHER

There are other things out there...

less expensive ways.

RICK

Could you watch them?

MOTHER

Oh... uh... well... I don't think

your father is willing to do that.

We raised our kids, Rick.

RICK

How `bout tonight, so I can catch a

breath?

MOTHER

What? My watching them while you

were in there with Phillip wasn't

enough? Make me feel guilty.

RICK

I'll just ask God to watch them. He

never abandons his children.

44.

MOTHER

Take this.

RICK

I don't want your money mom.

MOTHER

Take the money.

CUT TO:

NICHOLAS

I can't do it Daddy.

RICK

You can do it.

NICHOLAS

I can't do it.

RICK

Would you do it for a nickel?

NICHOLAS

I can't do it.

RICK

Watch daddy.

RICK

Daddy go potty in the potty.

NICHOLAS

Daddy?

RICK

Yes, Nicky?

45.

NICHOLAS

I peed.

RICK

Hi.

MELANIE

I'm Melanie... The baby-sitter...

RICK

Oh, right, I'm glad you could...

NICHOLAS

My daddy has a big pee-pee.

RICK

I was just demonstrating the art

of...

MELANIE

It's okay. I saw.

RICK

(Mumbling)

Great.

RICK

You have a kid.

MELANIE

So do you.

RICK

Not criticizing, just surprised. I

don't believe anyone at their old

day-care had kids. If they did they

kept them in a closet and only

brought them out on special

occasions. Christmas, Easter, an

occasional birthday, and maybe when

they had friends over for dinner,

but only as a status symbol. It was

like they'd say, "Here's the white

picket fence. Here's the SUV.

Here's the dog. Oh yes, here's the

2.5 children. Kids you can get back

in the closet now."

46.

MELANIE

You'd could make a fortune with a

Renta- Kid business.

RICK

That has potential.

MELANIE

I've often thought of renting mine.

Why pay for a baby-sitter when

thousands of people would pay good

money to set your kid on the mantle

for a few hours?

RICK

So, what's his name?

ZACH

I'm Zach.

RICK

Hello Zach. I'm Rick.

ZACH

You're old.

RICK

You got me there. I am old.

ZACH

How old?

RICK

Older than dirt. When I was a kid

we didn't have dirt. We had rocks

and we had hammers. If we wanted

dirt we banged a few rocks with

really big hammers, and then we had

dirt.

MELANIE

Worked the chain gangs?

ZACH

You're too old for my mom.

47.

RICK

This is Kristian. This is Phillip,

and the little guy from the potty,

is Nicholas. Guys, this is Zach

and...

MELANIE

Mel.

RICK

Mel.

MELANIE

Beautiful kids.

RICK

Thanks. So's your's.

MELANIE

Ever try Cheerios?

RICK

Huh?

MELANIE

For potty training. Give him

something to aim at. Drop a Cheerio

or two in the toilet and let him

pee away.

RICK

I'll have to try that. So, any

questions about the job? Melanie

moves towards the boys.

MELANIE

I'm going to go talk to them for a

little bit. I'll let you know.

ZACH

My mom tells great stories.

KRIS

We don't have a mom.

ZACH

That's okay, I don't have a dad.

48.

MELANIE

Once upon a time...

DISSOLVE TO:

MELANIE

The end...

BOYS IN UNISON

Read it again. Read it again. Read

it again.

MELANIE

I'm gonna talk to your dad.

BOYS IN UNISON

Please.

MELANIE

We'll read another one in a little

bit.

RICK

You have a real knack there.

MELANIE

Not a knack really. It's just about

finding hope in places there should

be none.

RICK

Whatever it is, I've never seen

them take to a woman like that.

Melanie smiles.

RICK

You want the job?

MELANIE

I'd like that.

CUT TO:

49.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOMAN

You're really funny... and kinda

cute.

RICK

Maybe we should...

WOMAN

Go out sometime? I'd like that.

When?

RICK

I don't know... maybe...

WOMAN

Tonight?

CUT TO:

MELANIE

No problem.

KRIS

Who was that?

MELANIE

That was your daddy.

PHILLIP

I love daddy.

50.

KRIS

Is he coming home?

MELANIE

No, he's going to be late. He has a

date.

MELANIE

So, I guess you have to deal with

me a little while longer.

BOYS IN UNISON

Yeah!

CUT TO:

WOMAN

You're a single father? That's

wonderful. So many men refuse to

accept any responsibility for their

kids. So, how many do you have?

RICK

Um... three.

WOMAN

That's amazing. I'm sure they're

just angels.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

51.

WOMAN

My sister has three. She said when

the second one was born it doubled

the work. She didn't realize the

third would double the work load

would again. And to think you do it

all by yourself.

RICK

Um... kinda.

WOMAN

You're a terrific man. Did I tell

you I love kids? They love me. It

just comes so instinctively even

though I've never had kids myself.

I get lots of practice with my

nephews though. So, when can I meet

your boys?

CUT TO:

KRIS

You're not my mom.

PHILLIP AND NICKY

Yeah!

CUT TO:

RICK

You can't.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

52.

CUT TO:

WOMAN 2

A guy like you is so hard to find.

I think I love you and I think you

need to love me too.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

53.

CUT TO:

RICK

That was incredible.

WOMAN 3

Yeah.

RICK

I know I haven't known you very

long, but I there's something I

need to say...

CUT TO:

RICK

(Calling out)

Was it something I said?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

54.

MELANIE

Did you have a good time?

RICK

Yeah, it was good... kinda okay...

pretty much sucked.

MELANIE

What happened?

RICK

Why can't I find a woman like you?

MELANIE

You're trying too hard.

RICK

I feel bad for the boys. They don't

have a "mom". She'll always be

their mother, but she'll never be

their mom.

MELANIE

Quit trying so hard. You're forcing

issues that can't be forced. Relax.

Everything happens when and how

it's suppose to. It's about spirit

and finding the will to love again,

for you and the boys.

RICK

You want to stay and...

MELANIE

I'm going to get...

RICK

Going?

MELANIE

Yeah.

RICK

You sure?

MELANIE

Positive.

55.

NICHOLAS (OS)

Daddy, I have to potty.

MELANIE

I'll see you tomorrow.

RICK

Ok.

CUT TO:

NICHOLAS

Nicky almost do'd it.

RICK

Almost, baby boy. Almost.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CARRIE

Finally had to grow up?

RICK

Yeah, I...

JOHN

You've got direction.

RICK

I suppose. I don't know if you'd

call it direction, but there's a

definite sense of purpose.

56.

CARRIE

Good for you.

RICK

Yeah, but is it good for the kids?

JOHN

Do the kids have direction?

CUT TO:

RICK

Only two kinds of people make it in

this world, boy; Those that are

smart and those that are strong. If

you don't want to be smart and do

your homework then you can be

strong and do pushups.

CUT TO:

RICK

I'm probably not as demanding of

them as I should be.

JOHN

You have to instill a sense of

direction at a very early age.

CUT TO:

MOTHER

So, Phillip what do you want to be

when you grow up?

57.

PHILLIP

Daddy says I can do three things

when I grow up.

MOTHER

And what are those? Phillip takes a

deep breath.

PHILLIP

I can go to college and move the

hell out of his house. I can join

the military and move the hell out

of his house, or I can get a job

and...

RICK

... move the hell out of my house.

MOTHER

Rick!

CUT TO:

RICK

Ya gotta let them be what they're

going to be.

JOHN

No, you have to mold them early. If

you don't mold them they'll grow up

to be Democrats.

RICK

And you do this with your kids?

JOHN

That's not the point, is it,

Carrie?

CARRIE

I think Rick is doing a wonderful

job.

RICK

It's a struggle, going at it alone,

but...

58.

CARRIE

Excuse me, gentleman, I need to

powder my nose.

JOHN

I can't believe you.

RICK

What?

JOHN

Whining about being single. Married

men would kill to be in your

situation!

RICK

I'm just saying it's hard.

JOHN

You have your sons to raise without

feminine interference. Do you

understand the significance of your

situation? Do you understand the

power in your circumstance?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JOHN

Men, all over the world, would kill

for that kind of power.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

59.

JOHN

You have the kids and she pays

child support... and you sit here

and whine about things being hard?

Give me a break.

RICK

It does have its advantages, I

suppose.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JOHN

Another?

RICK

Uh...

JOHN

On me.

RICK

Sure.

RICK

He went to grab a couple beers.

CARRIE

You know Rick, someday some girl is

going to realize what a good man

you are.

RICK

Carrie, I don't even have the funds

to buy my own beer.

60.

CARRIE

Love isn't about money. Love is

about truth and selflessness and

discovering who you are and who'll

be. Someday, someone will find you.

CUT TO:

MELANIE

I'll call you back.

MELANIE

What?

MELANIE

What was that for?

RICK

For finding me.

CUT TO:

NICHOLAS

Have to potty, daddy.

RICK

Go potty, buddy.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

61.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RICK

I thank you for everything, but

it's time to move on.

FRANK

Where are you going? What will you

do?

RICK

I don't know, Frank, but I'm worth

more than this.

FRANK (OS)

You'll never make it without me!

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

62.

CUT TO:

RICK

Phillip, what's wrong?

PHILLIP

Well, I wanted that piece and Kris

took that piece, and I really,

really wanted that piece.

MELANIE

What's so important about that

piece?

KRIS

It's bigger.

RICK

Easy on the drinks guys.

CUT TO:

MELANIE

What's wrong, Phillip?

PHILLIP

I gotta pee and Kris...

RICK

We're not going to fight over the

bathroom.

(Calling out)

(MOR E)

63.

RIC K (cont'd)

Kris, your brother has to go too.

Share!

MELANIE

What's that?

RICK

Huh? Oh, this? Nothing!

CUT TO:

PHILLIP

This time mine's bigger.

CUT TO:

CINDY (OS)

I'm really glad you could make it.

DISSOLVE TO:

RICK

I took off work to be here.

CINDY

Thank you.

RICK

So, what do you want?

64.

CINDY

I want to see your boys.

RICK

I don't think that's a good idea.

CINDY

I'm their mother.

RICK

You forfeited that obligation,

remember?

CINDY

That's not fair!

RICK

You abandoned your kids!

CINDY

I did not. I left them in the care

of their loving father. There's a

difference.

RICK

Is there?

CINDY

I just want to see the boys.

RICK

You think they even know who you

are?

CINDY

I'm their mother.

RICK

You keep saying that.

CINDY

I know things can never go back to

the way they were before.

CUT TO:

MAN

Next...

65.

CUT TO:

CINDY

Rick? Rick? Rick?

RICK

Huh?

CINDY

Let's keep the attorneys out of

this and settle things like civil

adults.

CUT TO:

RICK

Hi guys.

MELANIE

This is a surprise. Leave work to

spend the day with us?

RICK

Come on guys. Someone is here to

see you.

MELANIE

Rick?

(A beat)

Rick?

CUT TO:

66.

CINDY

Thank you.

RICK

Three hours.

CINDY

They'll be here.

CUT TO:

RICK

Where are you going.

MELANIE

Anywhere you're not.

RICK

What about the boys? What about me?

MELANIE

I'm all about second chances, but

not when I come in second place.

RICK

What are you talking about?

MELANIE

Why was she here? What was that?

RICK

She's their mother.

MELANIE

Mother? I've been more of a mother

than she ever was.

RICK

She's their mother.

MELANIE

Who willingly walked out of their

lives.

67.

RICK

She's their mother.

MELANIE

You keep saying that.

RICK

You think this is easy? You think

raising these boys is something I

want to do alone? Every day is like

a prison sentence. Every thing I

do, every decision I make is

directly affected by the boundaries

of my responsibility. I have three

children, but I have no me.

Everywhere I go people stare at

me...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RICK

They stare at me, and I know what

they're thinking...

CUT TO:

PEDESTRIAN

You poor, poor man. You poor, poor

children. How unfortunate to only

have your father. How terrible it

must be not to know your mother.

CUT TO:

68.

MELANIE

What about Zach? How noble of you

to be the only single parent in the

world. How stoic you are... so

concerned with the best interests

of your children. Too bad. Their

best interest is walking out the

door.

CUT TO:

KRIS

When can we see you again?

CINDY

Someday.

PHILLIP

Is someday tomorrow?

CINDY

Someday is someday, baby.

RICK

Give your Mom a hug, guys, then get

in the house.

CINDY

I'm sorry.

RICK

For?

CINDY

I thought things had changed.

RICK

But?

CINDY

I am who I am, Rick. I'm not cut

out to be a mommy.

69.

RICK

I could have told you that.

CINDY

I had to give it a shot. Rick turns

to walk away.

RICK

At whose expense? Huh, Cindy? At

whose expense? Who's going to dry

their tears tomorrow when they

realize your never coming back?

Who's going to rock them to sleep

at night when they ask why mommy

doesn't love them?

CINDY

You are, and you wouldn't have it

any other way.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PHILLIP

Is Mel coming today?

RICK

I don't know, buddy.

NICHOLAS

Daddy?

RICK

Yes Nicky?

NICHOLAS

I love Mel.

70.

RICK

She loves you too.

CUT TO:

KRIS (OS)

Daddy... Daddy... Dad!

RICK

(Yelling)

Don't you yell! If you have

something to say, come here and

tell me.

KRIS

Dad?

RICK

Yeah?

KRIS

Phillip's in the closet

CUT TO:

RICK

What were you doing in there?

PHILLIP

Being Daddy.

RICK

Who locked the door?

KRIS

Wasn't me...

71.

PHILLIP

I did.

CUT TO:

MOTHER

Rick?... Rick?... Rick?

MOTHER

Take care of my babies.

FATHER

What are you giving him money for?

MOTHER

To help him through the hard times.

He's a good father, just having a

rough go.

FATHER

I've never met a good father that

couldn't support his kids.

CUT TO:

72.

CUT TO:

FATHER (OS)

You could watch the boys while he

works.

MOTHER

I'm too old for that. The better

side of life has passed me by. What

if they fall? I don't hear like I

used to. What if one of them was

seriously hurt and I didn't hear

their cry? I hate that the only

thing I feel competent to do is

give them money. I love my son and

I love my grandbabies, but how

would I live with myself if

something happened to those

children?

REPRESENTATIVE

Sir, you're 3 months behind on your

electric bill.

REPRESENTATIVE (CONT'D)

It's a start, but not nearly

enough.

73.

CUT TO:

JAILER

I always knew you were a lifer.

CUT TO:

ADOPTION AGENT

Because of their age it may take

awhile. We'll start them out in

foster care, but eventually they'll

all be placed in loving, nurturing

environments.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RICK

They'll be together though, right?

ADOPTION AGENT

Mr. Stevens, I wish I could make

that promise, but the odds of an

adoptive family willing to take

them all is astronomical.

74.

RICK

Come on guys we're out of here.

ADOPTION AGENT

Mr. Stevens?

RICK

I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

CUT TO:

RICK

(Calling out.)

Can I get some help here.

RICK

Can you help me?

CONVICT

Can you help him?

RICK

I don't know.

CONVICT

What does he need?

RICK

I don't know.

CONVICT

He needs a father, not a book

reading baby-sitter.

RICK

(In a hushed rage)

I can't fucking do this.

CONVICT

Yes you can.

75.

CONVICT

Use your mind and your heart. It's

different than it ever should have

been... but different isn't wrong.

RICK

But I...

CONVICT

Use what you have. There is a vein

of wealth inside you just waiting

to be mined. Think differently than

you have ever thought before.

Worker harder than you ever thought

you could. Love these children like

they've never been loved before.

RICK

How?

CONVICT

The answer lies within. Quit

worrying about how these misguided

events have torn your life apart.

Quit dwelling on all of your

misgivings. Look around you. You're

not alone. But you, and you alone,

will make the difference.

CUT TO:

FADE TO:

76.

RICK

It's not worth a lot, maybe a few

hundred bucks, but it might keep

you in soap for a year.

CASE WORKER

Mr. Stevens, I can see you now.

Rick and the Pregnant Woman lock

eyes.

PREGNANT WOMAN

I ain't some charity case. I know

what you think when you look at me.

You think; Look at that poor, poor

woman. Look at those poor, poor

children. How unfortunate it must

be that they only have a mother.

How terrible it must be not to know

their father.

CASE WORKER

Mr. Stevens?

RICK

I didn't mean it like that?

PREGNANT WOMAN

No one ever does.

CASE WORKER

Mr. Stevens?

CASE WORKER

Mr. Stevens? I can see you now.

RICK

I'm sorry, I'm going to have to

reschedule.

CASE WORKER

Excuse me?

RICK

Responsibility calls.

CUT TO:

77.

NICHOLAS

Please daddy? Please? Rick opens

the book so all can see.

RICK

Once upon a time...

CUT TO:

NICHOLAS

Daddy, I'm hungry.

NICHOLAS

It's very, very empty.

PHILLIP

Daddy, I'm thirsty.

RICK

Get your coats on.

KRIS

We're leaving guys.

CUT TO:

78.

CLERK

Thirty-two hundred and fifty-six

dollars.

OLDER WOMAN

Think it's bad now? Wait til

they're teenagers.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RICK

Mom, I have an idea, but I need

your help.

RICK

Put your checkbook away. What I

need you can't buy.

MOTHER

What do you need.

RICK

For you to believe in me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

79.

MELANIE

I know you.

CINDY

Excuse me?

MELANIE

Rick's ex-wife?

CINDY

And you are?

MELANIE

Can I ask you a question? What is

Phillip's favorite color?

CINDY

Huh?

MELANIE

Blue. His favorite color is blue.

How many teeth has Kris lost?

CINDY

I don't know. Why?

MELANIE

Four. Two on top and two on bottom.

He got a quarter for the first one,

fifty cents for the next two and he

parlayed the last into an even

dollar. Nicholas cries at night

because he thinks the house is

filled with ghosts. Kiss him once

on the forehead, once on the cheek

and sing The Cradle Will Rock and

he'll sleep the whole night

through. Kris' favorite subject is

math. He loves to read and write,

but he doesn't do so well in social

studies. He knows how to ride a

bike. Why? Because I taught him.

Phillip wants to learn but he's

always afraid he'll fall. Nicky

just likes to Flintstone his

tricycle. Phillip's favorite

cartoon is Tunenami.

(MOR E)

80.

MEL ANIE (cont'd)

He's afraid of the dark and cries

himself to sleep at night saying

his mommy doesn't love him.

CINDY

What's your point?

MELANIE

I'm more their mom than you'll ever

be.

CINDY

So, why are you here with slick and

not with "your" kids?

MELANIE

Things change.

CINDY

Yeah... yeah they do. Now if you'll

excuse me I need to find the

asparagus.

(A beat)

I couldn't do it, ya know?

MELANIE

Do what?

CINDY

I always thought I wanted to be a

parent, and I was really good at

being pregnant, but I sucked as a

mom. I know that now. I don't have

what it takes.

MELANIE

I don't think I've ever felt as

much pity for anyone as I do for

you right now.

CINDY

Take care of my boys... all of

them.

CUT TO:

81.

RICK

Well, guys, I guess this is it.

KRIS

We can do it daddy.

RICK

Yes we can.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLIMBER

You can do it.

RICK

Yes we can.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

82.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RICK

What is it, Kris?

KRIS

Look daddy.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PHILLIP

We can do it.

RICK

(Through a weary voice.)

Yes we can.

CUT TO:

83.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RICK

Kris!

KRIS

Hey!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BOYFRIEND

What's wrong? What did I do?

84.

MELANIE

Not you, it's me.

BOYFRIEND

What then?

MELANIE

I'm sorry.

CUT TO:

RICK

Put the stone down.

PHILLIP

But...

RICK

No buts: Put the stone down.

RICK

I knew this was a hard climb,

but...

RESTING CLIMBER

Long way up.

RICK

Yeah.

RESTING CLIMBER

Long way down for that matter.

RICK

That too.

85.

RICK

So, what's your point.

RESTING CLIMBER

No point, just an observation.

Drink?

RICK

I'm okay.

RESTING CLIMBER

For the boys.

NICHOLAS

Daddy, I'm thirsty. Rick studies

the climber for a moment.

RICK

Go ahead.

RESTING CLIMBER

You know, if you stop here, halfway

between a long way up and a long

way down you really haven't

accomplished much, have you?

RICK

We're not stopping. We're just

resting.

RESTING CLIMBER

That's what I said, fourteen years

ago. Rick looks toward the top.

RICK

We can do this.

RESTING CLIMBER

Yes you can.

RICK

We can do this!

BOYS IN UNISON

Yes we can!

CUT TO:

86.

PROSECUTOR

What is so important Mr. Stevens

that you would burden this court

with convening today?

RICK

I just needed clarification.

PROSECUTOR

On what, Mr. Stevens? On what?

RICK

I know if I have to, I can do this

alone, but do I have to do this

alone? A hushed MURMUR rises in the

audience. The Judge RAPS his gavel

on the bench.

JUDGE

Order in this court! A beat as

things quiet down.

JUDGE (CONT'D)

Your inquiry, Mr. Stevens? Is it in

the best interest of the children

or in the best interest of you?

RICK

I don't know.

PROSECUTOR

He doesn't know. He just doesn't

know.

RICK

I don't know.

JUDGE

Then this court sees no reason to

amend the original verdict. The

order stands.

RICK

But...

PROSECUTOR

Tell it to someone who cares, Mr.

Stevens.

87.

RICK

I have. I have laid my heart out on

the line time and time again, only

to walk away empty handed. This

love, this caring, this sharing of

life, it's a sentence and my heart

has been condemned. It doesn't

matter who I've told, what's in my

heart is never quite enough. The

people I have cared for most have

shunned me in life and in love.

Unanswered phone calls... Unnoticed

displays of affection... A rose

that withers on the doorstep... No

matter what I do, it's never

enough. Just once, just one fucking

time, I want to be enough.

PROSECUTOR

Your only condemnation is self-

pity. You have people that care all

around you, but you're too blind to

see them. If you don't pull

yourself together soon, my friend,

they soon will all be gone.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MELANIE

What do you want?

RICK

I'm a proud man, sometimes foolish.

88.

MELANIE

Go on.

RICK

I have a long way to go before I

could ever be the man you need me

to be.

MELANIE

And?

RICK

And I got confused between what I

should have done and what I thought

was right.

MELANIE

Yes you did.

RICK

I put you on a pedestal and then I

knocked you down. It wasn't fair.

MELANIE

Life's not fair Rick.

RICK

You were more a mother to my boys

than they have ever known. You were

more a woman to me than I have ever

deserved.

MELANIE

You're right.

RICK

You're not going to make this easy,

are you?

MELANIE

Cut the bullshit, Rick.

RICK

(In Mel's ear)

I can live my life alone. I can

raise my kids alone. I can walk

this path alone. I'd much rather do

it with you.

89.

MELANIE

I can't.

RICK

Can't?

MELANIE

(Turning back around.)

I won't.

RICK

I shouldn't have come here.

MELANIE

No, you shouldn't have.

MELANIE

You just don't get it do you?

RICK

Get what?

MELANIE

You're here for you, you selfish

prick.

CUT TO:

MELANIE (VO)

Days go by when I lose me. There

are nights when I lay in bed and I

can hear Zach through the walls.

He's crying out for me, and I lay

there motionless, wishing I was

anyone but me, anywhere but here,

thinking that somewhere, sometime,

there has to be room for me. But

that someday never seems to come.

You're dangerous. Loving you means

I lose me. And I will never lose

let that happen.

(MOR E)

90.

MEL ANIE (VO) (cont'd)

So, don't come knocking on my door,

asking for my heart, if you don't

have room for me.

KRIS

I could have looked sad.

PHILLIP

I can look sad too.

KRIS

But I look sadder.

NICHOLAS

I sad.

CUT TO:

PHILLIP

Don't quit, daddy.

KRIS

Daddy doesn't quit.

CUT TO:

JOHN

You love her?

RICK

I think so... I don't know.

JOHN

If you think you're in love you

are.

91.

RICK

JOHN

RICK

JOHN

RICK

JOHN

RICK

JOHN

RICK

JOHN

RICK

JOHN

RICK

JOHN

RICK

JOHN

RICK

92.

JOHN

Loving your best friend confuses

things? I can't think of a love

more lucid. Rick stands to leave.

JOHN

You know I'll never forgive you for

this, don't you? You had the power

and the dream at your fingertips

and you're giving it all away.

RICK

You didn't marry your best friend?

JOHN

No.

RICK

I thought you had things all

planned out.

JOHN

Affairs of the heart and those of

the mind are two different things.

RICK

It's not too late, you know?

RICK

Go Home, John. Go home and talk to

your best friend the way you talk

to me.

RICK

I need you to watch the boys.

MOTHER

But you're father...

FATHER

Woman, enough.

MOTHER

But...

93.

FATHER

No more excuses. It's time to live

life and enjoy our grandkids.

(To Rick)

Go. The boys will be fine.

MOTHER

Can't we just give him money to pay

for a baby-sitter?

CUT TO:

MELANIE

(To herself)

Oh shit.

CUSTOMER

Whoa!

MELANIE

Sorry.

CUSTOMER

Pay attention, would ya?

MELANIE

What do you want?

RICK

To talk.

MELANIE

I'm working.

RICK

I know.

MELANIE

So, where are the boys?

94.

RICK

They're at my parents.

MELANIE

What? Not going to use them to try

to persuade me with guilt?

RICK

Is that what you thought?

MELANIE

I have a son of my own. I know when

people are using their kids.

CUSTOMER 2

Ma'am.

RICK

(To Customer 2)

Excuse us for a moment okay?

CUSTOMER 2

I'd just like some coffee.

CUSTOMER 2

(Calling out.)

Excuse me, Miss?

RICK

What is your problem?

CUSTOMER 2

Cold.

RICK

What?

CUSTOMER 2

The coffee, it's cold.

RICK

(Setting the cup back

down.)

Quit your bitching.

95.

MELANIE

I can't believe you came here.

RICK

I can't believe you're a waitress.

MELANIE

Beats chasing around after snot

nosed brats all day.

RICK

I thought you liked my kids.

MELANIE

I was talking about you.

RICK

I deserved that.

MELANIE

So, what do the kids need? A

babysitter? A surrogate mom?

RICK

This isn't about the kids.

MELANIE

Then what's it about?

RICK

It's about me, the selfish prick.

MELANIE

About you?

RICK

Hear me out, okay?

MELANIE

(Looking at her watch.)

You have 15 seconds.

RICK

Okay, okay.

MELANIE

Ten.

96.

RICK

Melanie, there is a grace about you

that reminds me how clumsy I am.

There is an honesty about you that

reminds me how deceitful I can be.

There is a beauty in your eyes that

reminds me how ugly I've become.

There is a kindness in your voice

that contradicts my coarseness.

There is a glow around you that

illuminates my dullness. There is

spirit in you that challenges my

laziness, but most of all, there is

a woman in you, that sparks my

desire, a desire to be graceful and

honest and beautiful and kind. A

desire to be better than I am or

ever thought I could be.

MELANIE

Go on.

RICK

I think my ten seconds are up.

MELANIE

Who's counting?

CUSTOMER 2

Miss... My coffee?

MELANIE

Get it yourself.

RICK

I love you.

MELANIE

I don't think I heard you.

RICK

If I give you my heart will you

promise to treat it softly? Kiss it

when it hurts? Put it in a box and

know that it belongs to you?

MELANIE

That's not what you said.

RICK

I said I love you.

97.

MELANIE

As brutal as that can be?

RICK

I love you. I love you, I love you,

I love you.

MELANIE

I kind of like you too.

CUT TO:

MELANIE

I never thought you'd make it.

RICK

Been waiting long?

MELANIE

I never thought you'd find me.

RICK

I had to find me first. I hope you

plan on walking, cause I'm not sure

I can carry you.

MELANIE

So, how do we do this? The two

begin the ascent together.

RICK

One step at a time?

MELANIE

Side by side?

RICK

Maybe you could carry me?

CUT TO:

98.

JAILER

Getting out of here, huh?

RICK

It's time to move on.

JAILER

If you leave don't ever come back.

RICK

Not even...

JAILER

Not even on a visit. You're a very

ugly man. I'd hate to explain to

the other guards why you'd come to

visit me.

CUT TO:

KRIS

Grandma?

MOTHER

Yes, Kris?

KRIS

Grandma I love you.

PHILLIP

I love her more.

NICHOLAS

I love her the whole universe.

MOTHER

I love you all the whole universe

plus one.

CUT TO:

99.

MELANIE

So, this is where it all happened.

RICK

It's funny, the tricks the mind can

play on you... but the Judge, he

sat right over there... and the

jury sat right there... and the

audience was filled with all these

people who didn't really give a

shit about me.

MELANIE

A bunch of innocent bystanders?

RICK

And they all sat passing judgement

on me, not knowing the situation,

just staring over their schoolmarm

spectacles and pointing their

crooked fingers.

MELANIE

All the world's a stage.

RICK

Always casting dispersions.

JUDGE (OS)

Guilty as charged.

MELANIE

Did you hear that?

RICK

Hear what?

MELANIE

Nothing... nothing at all.

CUT TO:

100.

JOHN

The secret of life, Melanie, is to

always pay attention...

JOHN

... always be prepared for what's

right around the corner. The CRACK

of the bat.

RICK

Duck!

JOHN

Huh?

FADE TO BLACK.
