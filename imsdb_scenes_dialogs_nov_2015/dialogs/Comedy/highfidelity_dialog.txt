FADE IN

ROB (V.O.)

What came first?  The music or the

misery?  People worry about kids

playing with guns and watching violent

videos, we're scared that some sort

of culture of violence is taking

them over...

ROB (V.O.)

But nobody worries about kids

listening to thousands -- literally

thousands -- of songs about broken

hearts and rejection and pain and

misery and loss.

ROB

Did I listen to pop music because I

was miserable, or was I miserable

because I listened to pop music?

LAURA

I don't really know what I'm doing.

ROB

You don't have to go this second.

You can stay until whenever.

LAURA

We've done the hard part now.  I

might as well, you know...

ROB

Well stay for tonight, then.

ROB

My desert-island, all-time, top five

most memorable break-ups, in

chronological order are as follows:

Alison Ashworth, Penny Hardwick,

Jackie Allen, Charlie Nicholson,

Sarah Kendrew.

ROB

Those were the ones that really hurt.

Can you see your name in that list,

Laura?  Maybe you'd sneak into the

top ten, but there's no place for

you in the top five.  Sorry.  Those

places are reserved for the kind of

humiliations and heartbreaks that

you're just not capable of delivering.

ROB

That probably sounds crueler than

it's meant to, but the fact is, we're

too old to take each other miserable.

Unhappiness used to mean something.

Now it's just a drag like a cold or

having no money.

ROB

If you really wanted to mess me up,

you should have got to me earlier.

CUT TO:

ROB (V.O.)

Which brings us to number one.  Alison

Ashworth.

ROB (V.O.)

My relationship with Alison Ashworth

lasted six hours.

ROB (V.O.)

The two hours after school and before

The Rockford Files, three days in a

row.  On the fourth afternoon.

ROB (V.O.)

Kevin Bannister.

ROB (V.O.)

It would be nice to think that since

I was fourteen, times have changed,

relationships have become more

sophisticated, females less cruel,

skins thicker, but there still seems

to be an element of that afternoon

in everything that has happened to

me since.  All my other romantic

stories seem to be a scrambled version

of that first one.

ROB

Number two.  Penny Hardwick.  Penny

was great-looking, and her top five

recording artists were Carly Simon,

Carole King, James Taylor, Cat

Stevens, and Elton John...

ROB (V.O.)

Everybody liked her.  She was nice.

Nice manners.  Nice grades.  Nice-

looking.

ROB (V.O.)

She was so nice, in fact, that she

wouldn't let me put my hand

underneath, or even on top of, her

bra.

ROB (V.O.)

Penny was nice, but I wasn't

interested in nice, just breasts,

and therefore she was no good to me.

And so I was finished with her.

ROB

What's the point?  It never goes

anywhere.

CUT TO:

ROB

She cried, and I hated her for it,

because she made me feel bad.  I

started dating a girl who everybody

said would put out, and Penny went

with this asshole Chris Thompson who

told me that he had sex with her

after something like three dates.

How had Penny gone from a girl who

wouldn't do anything to a girl who

would do everything?

ROB

My store's right up here.  It's called

The Record Exchange.  It's carefully

placed to attract the bare minimum

of window shoppers.

ROB

I get by because of the people who

make a special effort to shop here

on Saturday young men, always young

men, who spend a disproportionate

amount of their time looking for

deleted Smiths singles and "original

not rereleased" underline Frank Zappa

albums.

ROB

The fetish properties are not unlike

porn.  I would feel guilty taking

their money if I wasn't, kind of,

well, one of them.

ROB

'Morning, Dick.

DICK

Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.

ROB

Good weekend?

DICK

Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice

Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The

one on Testament of Youth.  Never

released here.  Japanese import only.

ROB

Great.

DICK

I'll tape it for you.

ROB

No, that's okay.  Really.

DICK

'Cause you like their second one,

you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one

with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You

didn't see the cover though.

ROB

Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that

one.

DICK

Well, I'll just make it for you.

ROB

(resigned)

Okay.

CUT TO:

ROB

(re: music)

What's this?

DICK

The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like

it?

BARRY

BAA!  BA BA DANG!

BARRY

Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?

DICK

It's the new --

ROB

It's the record we've been listening

to and enjoying, Barry.

BARRY

Well that's problematic because it

sucks ass.

BARRY

(re: the CD)

Yours, I assume...

ROB

(over the blare)

TURN IT OFF, BARRY.

BARRY

IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.

BARRY

What are you doing?

ROB

I don't want to hear Public Enemy

right now.

BARRY

Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do

is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on

some old sad bastard music see if I

care.

ROB

I don't want old sad bastard music

either.  I just want something I can

ignore.

BARRY

But it's my new tape.  My Monday

morning tape.  I made it last night

just for today.

ROB

Yeah, well it's fucking Monday

afternoon.  You should get out of

bed earlier.

BARRY

Don't you want to hear what's next?

ROB

What's next?

BARRY

Play it.

ROB

Say it.

BARRY

(sighs)

"Little Latin Lupe Lu."

DICK

Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?

BARRY

(defensive)

No.  The Righteous Brothers.

DICK

Oh well.  Nevermind.

BARRY

What?

DICK

Nothing.

BARRY

No, not nothing.  What's wrong with

the Righteous Brothers?

DICK

Nothing.  I just prefer the other

one.

BARRY

Bullshit.

ROB

How can it be bullshit to state a

preference?

BARRY

Since when did this shop become a

fascist regime?

ROB

Since you brought that bullshit tape

in.

BARRY

(sarcastic)

Great.  That's the fun of working in

a record store.  Playing crappy pap

you don't want to listen to.  I

thought this tape was going to be,

you know, a conversation stimulator.

I was going to ask you for your top

five records to play on a Monday

morning and all that, and you just

had to ruin it.

ROB

We'll do it next Monday.

BARRY

Well what's the point in that?

ROB

Hey.  Didn't you steal that one

already?

DICK

Can I help you?

JUSTIN

Just this.

DICK

That'll be fifteen-twenty-seven.

VINCE

Isn't your name Dick?

DICK

Yes.

VINCE

That sucks.  Get it?

CUT TO:

ROB

I'm sick of the sight of this place,

to be honest.  Some days I'm afraid --

ROB

I'm afraid I'll go berserk, rip the

Elvis Costello mobile from the

ceiling, throw the "Country Artists

Male A-K" rack out onto the streets,

go off to work in a Virgin Megastore

and never come back --

CUSTOMER (O.S.)

I'm looking for a record for my

daughter.  For her birthday.  "I

Just Called To Say I Love You." Do

you have it?

BARRY (O.S.)

Oh yeah.  We got it.

CUSTOMER (O.S.)

Great.  Can I have it then?

BARRY (O.S.)

No, you can't.

CUSTOMER

Why not?

BARRY

Because it's sentimental tacky crap,

that's why not.  Do we look like the

kind of store that sells "I Just

Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to

the mall and stop wasting our time.

CUSTOMER

What's your problem?  What did I...

Why are you --

BARRY

Do you even know your daughter?

There is no way she likes that song.

Or is she in a coma?

CUSTOMER

Okay, okay, buddy.  I didn't know it

was Pick On the Middle-Aged Square

Guy Day.  My apologies.  I'll be on

my way.

BARRY

B'Bye!

CUSTOMER

FUCK YOU!

ROB

Nice, Barry.

BARRY

Rob.  Top five musical crimes

perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the

'80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is

it in fact unfair to criticize a

formerly great artist for his latter-

day sins?  "Is it better to burn out

than to fade away?"

ROB

You just drove a fucking customer

away, Barry.

BARRY

We didn't even really have it.  I

happen to know for a fact that the

only Stevie Wonder single we have is

"Don't Drive Drunk." I was just

goofing on the straight, and it never

cost you a penny.

ROB

Not the point.

BARRY

Oh, so what's the point then?

ROB

I don't want you talking to our

customers like that again.

BARRY

"Our customers?" You think that Mr.

L.L. Bean out there is going to be a

regular?

ROB

Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we

used to fuck with anyone who asked

for anything we didn't like, but

it's gotta stop.

BARRY

Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy

one record -- which we didn't even

have -- and leave and never come

back again anyway.  Why not have a

little fun?  Big fucking deal.

ROB

What did he ever do to you?

BARRY

He offended me with his terrible

taste.

ROB

It wasn't even his terrible taste.

It was his daughter's.

BARRY

Oh, now you're defending that

motherfucker?  You're going soft in

your old age, Rob.  There was a time

when you would have chased him out

of the store and up the street.  Now

all of a sudden I'm offending your

golf buddy.

(sarcastic)

You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry.

How are we ever going to make enough

money to get you and Laura into the

country club?

BARRY

And by the way, I tell you this for

your own good: That's the worst

sweater I've ever seen.  I have never

seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone

I'm on speaking terms with.  It's a

disgrace to the human race.

DICK

Hey, guys... Hey.

BARRY

(extremely shaken)

What are you, some kind of fucking

maniac?  If this jacket's torn you're

gonna pay big.

DICK

Are you all right?

ROB

Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura

and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if

we ever see Barry again maybe you

can tell him that.

DICK

'Course I will, Rob.  No problem.

No problem at all.  I'll tell him

next time I see him.

DICK

I've ah... got some other stuff to

tell him anyway, so it's no problem.

I'll just tell him about, you know,

Laura, when I tell him the other

stuff.

ROB

Fine.

DICK

I'll start with your news before I

tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't

much, really, just about Marie LaSalle

(flashes CD of pretty

woman)

playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I

like her, you know, she's kind of

Sheryl Crowish... but, you know,

good.  So I'll tell him before that.

Good news and bad news kind of thing.

DICK

Or rather, bad news and good news,

because he likes this person playing

tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura

too, I didn't mean that.  And he

likes you.  It's just that --

ROB

I understand, Dick.

DICK

Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you

want to... talk about it, that kind

of thing?

ROB

No.  Thanks though, Dick.

CUT TO:

ROB

Number three in the top five break-

ups was Charlie Nicholson, sophomore

year of college.  Some people never

got over 'Nam, or the night their

band opened for Nirvana.  I guess I

never really got over Charlie.

CUT TO:

ROB (V.O.)

She looked different.  Dramatic.

Exotic.  She talked a lot, about

remarkably interesting things like

music, books, film, and politics...

ROB (V.O.)

(over her talking)

...so we didn't have those terrible,

strained sentences, that seemed to

characterized most of my

relationships.  And she liked me.

She liked me.  She liked me.

ROB (V.O.)

We went out for two years, and for

every single minute I felt as though

I was standing on a dangerously narrow

ledge.  I couldn't get comfortable,

couldn't ever stretch out and relax.

Why would a girl -- no, a woman --

like Charlie go out with someone who

only a few years ago sewed a Foghat

patch on his jacket?  I felt like

all those people who suddenly shaved

their heads and said they'd always

been punks.  I felt like a fraud.

And I was depressed by the lack of

flamboyance in my wardrobe...

ROB (V.O.)

...I worried about my abilities as a

lover.  I was intimidated by the

other men in her design department,

and became convinced that she was

going to leave me for one of them.

ROB (V.O.)

She left me for one of them.  The

dreaded Marco.

ROB (V.O.)

And I lost it.  I lost it all.

Dignity, faith, fifteen pounds...

ROB (V.O.)

Any small idea of personal identity

that I had acquired up to that point.

ROB (V.O.)

I came to three months later, and to

my surprise had flunked out of school

and started working in a record store.

ROB

What I really learned from the Charlie

Debacle is that you gotta punch your

weight.  Charlie was out of my Class:

too pretty, too smart, too witty,

too much.  What am I?  Average.  A

middleweight.  Not the smartest guy

in the world, but certainly not the

dumbest.  I've read books like The

Unbearable Lightness of Being,

Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time

of Cholera, and understood them, I

think -- they're about girls, right? --

just kidding -- but I don't like

them very much.  My all time top

five favorite books are Johnny Cash's

autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil

Stevenson, Zen and the Art of

Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser

Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't

know, probably something by Kurt

Vonnegut.  I look through the New

Yorker when my neighbor's done with

it, and I'm not averse to going down

to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles

films, although on the whole I prefer

American films.  Top five being Blade

Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first

two Godfathers which we'll count as

one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining.

I'm okay looking, average height,

not skinny, not fat.  My genius, if

I can call it that, is to combine a

whole load of averageness into one

compact frame.  You might say there

were millions like me, but there

aren't, really: Alot of guys have

impeccable music taste but don't

read, alot of guys read but are really

fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to

women but have stupid beards, alot

of guys have a Woody Allen sense of

humor but look like Woody Allen.

Some drink too much, some drive like

assholes, some get into fights, or

show off money, or do drugs.  I don't

do any of these things, really.  If

I do okay with women it's not because

of the virtues I have, but because

of the ugly flaws I don't have...

So.  Charlie and I didn't match.

After her I was determined to never

get out of my league again.

JANET

(on machine)

Hello, you two.  Laura, it's your

mother.  Your father's angina is a

little rough today and I thought

he'd like to talk to you.  No big

deal.  I love you two.  Bye.

LIZ

(on machine)

Rob, it's Liz.  Just calling to see,

well, if you're okay.  Give me a

ring.  I'm not taking sides.  Yet.

Lot's of love.  Bye.

ROB (V.O.)

Charlie and I didn't match.  Marco

and Charlie matched.  Me and Sarah,

number four on the all time break-

ups list, matched.  She wore more or

less the same clothes as mine, had

an acceptable working knowledge of

music, and she had been dumped by

some asshole named Michael.  He was

her moment, Charlie was mine.  Sarah

had sworn off men.  I had sworn off

women.  It made sense to pool our

loathing of the opposite sex, swear

them off together, and get to share

a bed with someone at the same time.

ROB (V.O.)

We were frightened of being left

alone for the rest of our lives.

Only people of a certain disposition

are frightened of being alone for

the rest of their lives at twenty-

six.  We were of that disposition.

Everything seemed much later than it

was.

ROB (V.O.)

When she told me that she met someone

else it made no sense.  Her meeting

someone else was contrary to the

whole spirit of our arrangement.

All we really had in common was that

we were dumped by people, and that

we were against dumping.  We were

violently anti-dump.  So how come I

got dumped?

ROB

You run the risk of losing anyone

who is worth spending time with.

But I didn't know that at the time.

All I saw was that I'd moved down a

division and that it still hadn't

worked out, and this seemed cause

for a great deal of misery and self-

pity.  And that's when Laura came

along.

ROB

I'm reorganizing my records tonight.

It's something I do in times of

emotional distress.  When Laura was

here I had them in alphabetical order,

before that, chronologically.

Tonight, though, I'm trying to put

them in the order in which I bought

them.  That way I can write my own

autobiography without picking up a

pen.  Pull them all off the shelves,

look for Revolver and go from there.

I'll be able to see how I got from

Deep Purple to The Soft Boys in twenty-

five moves.  What I really like about

my new system is that it makes me

more complicated than I am.  To find

anything you have to be me, or at

the very least a doctor in Rob-ology.

If you wanna find Landslide by

Fleetwood Mac you have to know that

I bought it for someone in the fall

of 1983 and then didn't give it to

them for personal reasons.  But you

don't know any of that, do you?  You

would have to ask me to--

ROB

Yeah?

MOM

Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.

ROB

Hi, Mom.

MOM

Everything all right?

ROB

Great.  Super-fantastic.

MOM

How's the store?

ROB

So so.  Up and down.

MOM

Your lucky Laura's doing so well.

If it wasn't for her, I don't think

either of us would ever sleep...

ROB

She left.  She's gone.

MOM

What do you mean?  Where did she go?

ROB

How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend.

Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura

move out.

MOM

Well call her mother.

ROB

She just called.  She doesn't even

know.  It's probably the last time

I'll ever hear her voice.  That's

weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas

at somebody's house, you know, and

you worry about their operations and

you see them in their bathrobe, and...

I dunno...

ROB

There'll be another mom and another

Christmas.  Right?

ROB

Hello?  Anybody there?

ROB

I'm all right, if that's what's

upsetting you.

MOM

You know that's not what's upsetting

me.

ROB

Well it fucking should be, shouldn't

it?

MOM

I knew this would happen.  What are

you going to do Rob?

ROB

I'm going to drink this bottle of

wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then

tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.

MOM

And after that?

ROB

Meet a nice girl and have children.

I promise the next time we talk I'll

have it all sorted out.

MOM

I knew this was going to happen.

ROB

Then what are you getting so upset

about?

MOM

What did Laura say?  Do you know why

she left?

ROB

It's got nothing to do with marriage,

if that's what you're getting at.

MOM

So you say.  I'd like to hear her

side of it.

ROB

Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm

telling you Laura didn't want to get

married!  She is not that kind of

girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not

what happens now.

MOM

Well I don't know what happens now,

apart from you meet someone, you

move in, she goes.  You meet someone,

you move in, she goes.

ROB

Shut up, Mom.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ROB

Peter.  Frampton.  That perm! "Show

Me the Way"!  A phenomenon based on

a live album that was actually

recorded in a studio!  What is

happening?  I am getting misty, choked

up at a song that I had the good

sense at twelve to realize was so

saccharine and stupid as to be

inarticulatable, until Michael Bolton,

that is.

ROB

Sentimental music makes you nostalgic

and hopeful at the same time.  Marie's

the hopeful part.  Laura's the

nostalgia part.  These things happen.

They happen to men, at any rate.

This is why I shouldn't be listening

to pop music.

DICK

ROB!

ROB

I always hated this song.

DICK

Yeah.

BARRY

Yeah.

ROB

But now I kind of like it.

DICK

She shouldn't done it on "The Number

Four With a Smile."

BARRY

Isn't her album called "Number Four

With A Smile?"

DICK

That's what I said.

BARRY

No, no, no, you said "The Number

Four With a Smile," and there's no

"The" at the front of the title of

the album.

DICK

It's a reference to a Chinese meal

in Toronto and I think that there is

a "The."  But I could be wrong.

BARRY

You can be and are wrong.

BARRY

I wanna date a musician...

ROB

(nods in agreement)

I wanna live with a musician.  She'd

write songs at home, ask me what she

thought of them, maybe even include

one of our private jokes in the liner

notes.

BARRY

...Maybe a picture of me in the liner

notes...

DICK

Just in the background somewhere.

MARIE

Thanks, you guys, I know I'm not

supposed to like that song, but I

do.  I'm gonna take a break for a

second.  Anybody wants to buy one of

my tapes, they're five bucks up here.

One of my other personalities will

be selling them.

BARRY

Let's go get one.

ROB

Let's not.

DICK

I want a tape.

ROB

I don't need to go up there right

now.

MARIE

Enjoying yourselves?

MARIE

Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.

ROB

Good.

ROB

So you live in Chicago now?

MARIE

Yup.  Not far from here, actually.

BARRY

You like it?

MARIE

It's okay.  Hey.  You guys might be

the sort to know.  Are there any

good record stores around here or do

I have to go downtown?

DICK

He's got one!

BARRY

On Clark Street!

DICK

A couple blocks!  About six!

BARRY

We work there!

DICK

You'd love it!

MARIE

What do you sell?

BARRY

A little of anything that matters.

Rock, soul, R&B, punk rock, hip-

hop, ska, new wave...

MARIE

Sounds great.

ROB

What did you tell her about the shop

for?

BARRY

I didn't know it was classified

information.  I mean, I know we don't

have any customers, but I thought

that was a bad thing, not, like, a

business strategy.

CUT TO:

BARRY (O.S.)

ROB!  PHONE!

ROB

Rob here.

LIZ (O.S.)

Hey.  It's Liz.

ROB

What's happenin'.

LIZ

You called this morning?

ROB

Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you

for that message last night.  It

made me feel like... like less of an

asshole.

LIZ

How're you holding up?

ROB

Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great.

Last night I got to thinking, "you

know what?  Maybe it is time to move

on.  Maybe we're just not right for

each other.  Or maybe we are.  But

time will tell and at this point I'm

going to be fine with whatever's

meant to be." You know?

LIZ

Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to

take sides.  And I like Laura with

you.  She's more fun, more open.

You guys are good together.  I just

wish you two could, I don't know.  I

don't think much of this Ian guy --

DICK

Rob.

ROB

Liz, hold on a second --

(turns to Dick)

What?

DICK

Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here,

she's here, and now!

ROB

Liz, can you hold for a second?

ROB

(to Dick)

I'll be out there!  Go!

(picks up the phone)

Hey, Liz, I gotta go... Tomorrow

night?  Great.  Green Mill.  Fine.

Seven?  Done.  Thanks.  Right.  Bye.

ROB

Oh.  Hi.

MARIE

(re: music)

Don't you like that?

ROB

No, no, I love, it's just, thinking

you're, you must be so sick of it...

Well.

ROB

WHAT FUCKING IAN GUY?!!

DICK

Rob --!

ROB

-- FUCK OFF!

BARRY

We're only on the fucking list for

Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's

all!  All three of us.

ROB

That's fucking great, Barry.  We can

spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save

five each.  Fantastic, Barry!

BARRY

We can take your car.

ROB

It's not my car, now is it?  It's

Laura's car, and thus Laura has it.

So it's an ass-bumping double-

transferring bus ride through

bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab.

Wow.  Fucking great.

BARRY

Jaggoff...

ROB

Who the fuck is Ian?!

CUT TO:

ROB

Laura doesn't know anybody called

Ian.  There's no Ian at her office.

She has no friends named Ian.  She

has never met anyone called Ian in

her whole life.  Although there may

have been one in college -- but I am

almost certain that since 1989 she

has lived in an Ian-less universe.

ROB

"I. Raymond." Ray. "I." IAN.

CUT TO:

ROB

Mr. I Raymond. "Ray" to his friends,

and, more importantly, to his

neighbors.  The guy who up until

about six weeks ago lived upstairs.

I knew it was him the moment I saw

the letter.  I start to remember

things now: His stupid clothing, his

music -- Latin, Bulgarian, whatever

fucking world music was trendy that

week--stupid laugh, awful cooking

smells.  I can't remember anything

good about him at all.  I never liked

him much then, and I fucking hate

him now... I manage to block out the

worst, most painful, most disturbing

memory of him until I go to bed.

ROB

Jeez.  He goes on long enough.

LAURA

I should be so lucky.

ROB

You are as abandoned and as noisy as

any character in a porn film, Laura.

You are Ian's plaything, responding

to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic

delight.  No woman in the history of

the world is having better sex than

the sex you are having with Ian in

my head.

ROB

Number five -- Jackie Allen.  My

break up with Jackie Allen had no

effect on my life whatsoever.  I

just slotted her in to bump you out

of position, Laura.  Yes, you do in

fact make it into the top five.

Welcome.  And just to remind you,

the list is in chronological order,

not in the order of pain and

suffering.

FEMALE VOICE

Hey.

GIRL

Do you have soul?

ROB

That all depends.

ROB

Record Exchange... How many records...

Right, well if you could bring them --

okay, well, where do you live?

Right... how about now?  I can come

right over...

(Rob scribbles)

Okay.

ROB

(to Dick)

Some lady's got some singles to sell.

I'll be back in a half-hour.

ROB

Hi.  You called about the records?

WOMAN

Those.

WOMAN

What do you think?

ROB

It's the best collection I've ever

seen.

WOMAN

Give me fifty bucks and they're all

yours.

ROB

These are worth at least, I don't

know --

WOMAN

I know what they're worth.  Give me

fifty and get them out.

ROB

But you must have --

WOMAN

I must have nothing.  Their my

husband's.

ROB

And you must not be getting along

too well right now, huh?

WOMAN

He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three-

year-old.  A friend of my daughter's.

He had the fucking nerve to call me

and ask me to borrow some money and

I told him to fuck off, so he asked

me to sell his singles collection

and send him a check for whatever I

go, minus a ten percent commission.

Which reminds me.  Can you make sure

you give me a five?  I want to frame

it and put it on the wall.

ROB

It must have taken him a long time

to get them together.

WOMAN

Years.  This collection is as close

as he's ever come to an achievement.

ROB

Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You

don't have to tell him what you got.

Send him forty-five bucks and blow

the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or

something.

WOMAN

That wasn't part of the deal.  I

want to be poisonous but fair.

ROB

(looking back at the

records)

Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't

want to be any part of this.

WOMAN

Suit yourself.  There are plenty of

others who will.

ROB

That's why I'm trying to compromise.

What about fifteen-hundred?  They're

worth five times that.

WOMAN

Sixty.

ROB

Thirteen hundred.

WOMAN

Seventy-five.

ROB

Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest

offer.

WOMAN

And I won't take a penny over ninety.

WOMAN

With eleven hundred he could come

home, and that's the last thing I

want.

ROB

I'm sorry but I think you better

talk to someone else.

WOMAN

Fine.

ROB

Can I buy this Otis Redding single

off you?

WOMAN

Sure.  Ten cents.

ROB

Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten

dollars for this, and you can give

the rest away for all I care.

WOMAN

Okay.  Because you took the trouble

to come up here.  And because you've

got principles.  But that's it.  I'm

not selling them to you one by one.

CUT TO:

ROB

How come I end up siding with the

bad guy, the man who ran off to

Jamaica with some nymphette?  I just

got left for someone else, so why

can't I bring myself to feel whatever

it is his wife is feeling?  All I

can see is that guy's face when he

gets that pathetic check in the mail

for those records, and I can't help

but feel desperately, painfully sorry

for him.

CUT TO:

LIZ

MOTHERFUCKER.

ROB

What's the -- hey, Liz --

LIZ

-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked

to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and

she gave me a little background.

And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.

LIZ

To think I sympathized with you for

two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left

him out of nowhere for the schmuck

upstairs.  You let me believe that!

ROB

It's true!

LIZ

Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura

pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat

on her!  You borrowed money from her

and never paid a dime back!  And

then, just a few weeks ago, you told

her you were unhappy with her and

were "kind of looking around for

somebody else!"

ROB

Well she --

ROB

She's right, of course.  I am a

fucking asshole.  I did and said

those things.  But before you judge,

although you've probably already

done so, go off for a minute and

write down the top five worst things

that you have done to your partner,

even if -- especially if -- your

partner doesn't know about them.

Don't dress things up or try to

explain them.  Just write them down

in the plainest language possible...

ROB

Pencils down.  Okay, so who's the

asshole now?

CUT TO:

BARRY

It's almost impossible to find,

especially on CD.  Yet another cruel

trick on all of the dumbasses who

got rid of their turntables.  But

every other Echo and the Bunnymen

album --

CUSTOMER

I have all of the others.

BARRY

Oh really.  Well what about the first

Jesus and Mary Chain?

CUSTOMER

They always seemed...

BARRY

They always seemed what?  They always

seemed really great, is what they

always seemed.  They picked up where

your precious Echo left off, and

you're sitting here complaining about

no more Echo albums.  I can't believe

that you don't own that record.

That's insane.

CUSTOMER

Well what about the new Echo --

BARRY

Do not get ahead of yourself.

DICK

The interesting thing about Green

Day is that so much of their music

is in truth directly influenced by,

in my opinion, two bands.

FEMALE CUSTOMER

The Clash.

DICK

Correct.  The Clash.  But also the

Stranglers.

FEMALE CUSTOMER

Who?

DICK

I think you would love the

Stranglers...

FEMALE CUSTOMER

This sounds great.

CUSTOMER

Is this the new Green Day?

BARRY

That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone

you don't own fucking Blonde on

Blonde.  What about Television?

CUSTOMER

I have a television.

BARRY

NO--!

ROB

I will now sell four copies of Cats

and Dogs by the Royal Trux.

DICK

Do it.  Do it.

CUSTOMER

(re: music)

What is this?

ROB

It's the Royal Trux.

CUSTOMER

It's great.

ROB

I know.

ROB

Dick, ring the man up...

ROB

DICK!  THE DOOR!

ROB

Okay, fuckos.  How much is this deck

worth to you, and how many CD's did

you rip off?  Can you do the math?

ROB

(to Vince)

And what about you, dork?

ROB

Dick, call the police, please.

ROB

(looking through the

CD's)

Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik.

Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg.

Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett...

What's going on here?  Are you guys

stealing for other people now?

VINCE

Naw.  Those are for us.

ROB

Oh really.  You two are slamming to

Nico now?

JUSTIN

You're, like, so bigoted to look at

us and, like, think you know what we

listen to.

VINCE

You got the CD's so can I have my

board back?

ROB

I think you have more.

VINCE

Well we don't.

ROB

I can't frisk you but the cops can.

ROB

Jesus.  That thing's been in the

bargain bin for six months!  Was it

just your criminal nature or what?

Hell, I would've given it to you for

free.

VINCE

No, we...

JUSTIN

We don't know how it works.  Nobody

even knows, so we wanted to check it

out in that mag.

JUSTIN

Like, do you know how to actually

make a CD?

ROB

Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple.

You make the tracks -- recording

studio -- deliver them to the pressing

plant where a master is cut, the

master is then dubbed to submasters,

which are the "mothers," as their

called, for each press in the plant.

You press the CD's or records, put

in your cover art, and that's it.

VINCE

Records are those big round black

things, right?

ROB

Fuck off.

VINCE

Hey, can I have my board?

CUT TO:

BARRY

(to Rob)

What?

ROB

What do you mean, "what?"

BARRY

What are you snickering about?

ROB

I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling.

Because I'm happy.

BARRY

What am I missing?  What do you have

to be happy about?

DICK

Well we rang $900 today.

ROB

Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy

because I'm proud of us.  Because

although our talents are small and

peculiar, we use them to their best

advantage.

ROB

Shit!

LAURA

Hi.

ROB

Hi.

LAURA

I thought I could give you a lift

back.

ROB

Are you coming home?

LAURA

Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your

house to get some things.

ROB

My house?

ROB

First of all: The money.  The money

is easy to explain: She had it and I

didn't, and she wanted to give it to

me.  If she hadn't, I would have

gone under.  I've never paid her

back because I've never been able

to, and just because she's took off

and moved in with some Supertramp

fan doesn't make me five grand richer.

So that's the money --

CUT TO:

LAURA

You can make all the faces you want.

My car.  My car stereo.  My

compilation tape.

ROB

How can you like Art Garfunkel and

Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you

support the Israelis and the

Palestinians.

LAURA

It's not like saying that at all,

actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and

Marvin Gaye make pop records --

ROB

-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead,

his father shot him in --

LAURA

-- whatever, and the Israelis and

the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel

and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a

bitter territorial dispute, and the

Israelis and the Palestinians are.

Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --

ROB

-- Alright, alright but --

LAURA

-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye,

anyway?

ROB

Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It

Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye

is responsible for our entire

relationship!

LAURA

Is that right?  I'd like a word with

him.

ROB

But don't you remember?

LAURA

I remember the song.  I just couldn't

remember who sang it.

LAURA

I can see why you prefer Gaye to

Garfunkel.  I get it, really.  But

there are so many other things to

worry about.  They're only records,

and if one is better than the other,

well, who cares, besides you and

Barry and Dick?  I mean really, who

gives a flying fuck?

ROB

You used to care more about things

like Marvin Gaye than you do now.

When I first met you, and I made you

that tape, you loved it.  You said --

and I quote -- "It was so good it

made you ashamed of your record

collection."

LAURA

Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay,

and I thought you were hot, and I

didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted

one.

ROB

So you weren't interested in music

at all?

LAURA

Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am

now.  That's life though, isn't it?

ROB

But Laura... that's me.  That's all

there is to me.  There isn't anything

else.  If you've lost interest in

that, you've lost interest in

everything.

LAURA

You really believe that?

ROB

Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our --

the apartment.  What else do I have,

other than records and CDs?

LAURA

And do you like it that way?

ROB

Not really.

LAURA

Let's go in.

ROB

Okay, Number two: The stuff I told

her about being unhappy in the

relationship, about half looking

around for someone else: She tricked

me into saying it.  We were having

this state of the union type

conversation and she said, quite

matter-of-factly, that we were pretty

unhappy at the moment, and did I

agree, and I said yes, and she asked

whether I ever thought about meeting

someone else.  So I asked her if she

ever thought about it, and she said

of course, so I admitted that I

daydream about it from time to time.

Now I see that what we were really

talking about was her and Ian, and

she suckered me into absolving her.

It was a sneaky lawyer's trick, and

I fell for it, because she's much

smarter than me.

ROB

You can take it with you if you want.

LAURA

Have you tackled the Great

Reorganization yet?

ROB

Don't you think there are more

important things to talk about than

my record collection?

LAURA

You bet.  I've been saying that for

years.

ROB

So.  Where have you been staying for

the last week?

LAURA

I think you know that.

ROB

Had to work it out for myself, though,

didn't I?

LAURA

I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair

to you.  That's why I came here to

the store this evening.  I feel

terrible, Rob.  This is really hard,

you know.

ROB

Good.

(beat)

So.  Is it my job?

LAURA

What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is

that what you think?  That your not

big enough a deal for me?  Jesus,

gimme a little credit, Rob.

ROB

I don't know.  It's one of the things

I thought of.

LAURA

What were the others?

ROB

Just the obvious stuff.

LAURA

What's the obvious stuff?

ROB

I don't know.

LAURA

I guess it's not that obvious, then.

ROB

No.

ROB

And number three: The Pregnancy.  I

didn't know she was pregnant.  Of

course I didn't.  She hadn't told me

because I had told her I was... sort

of... seeing somebody else.  We

thought we were being very grown-up,

but we were being preposterously

naive, childish even, to think that

one of us could fuck around and then

own up to it while we were living

together.  So -- I didn't find out

about it 'til way later.  We were

going through a good period and I

made a crack about having kids and

she burst into tears.  I made her

tell me what it was all about, and

she did.  I felt guilty and so I got

angry.  She told me that at the time

I didn't look like a very good long-

term bet.  That it was a hard decision

and she didn't see any point in

consulting me about it...  When the

whole sorry tale comes out in a great

big --

LAURA (O.S.)

What?

ROB

(covering)

What, what?

LAURA

Did you say something?

ROB

No.  So.  Is it working out with

Ian?

LAURA

Rob.  Don't be childish.

ROB

Why is that childish?  Your living

with the guy!  I'm just asking how

it's going.

LAURA

I am not living with him.  I've just

been staying with him for a few days

until I work out what I'm doing.

Look, this has nothing to do with

anyone else.  You know that, don't

you?  I left because we weren't

exactly getting along, and we weren't

talking about it.  And I suddenly

realized that I like my job, and I

like what my life is could be turning

into, and that I'm getting to a point

where I want to get my shit together

and I can't really see that ever

happening with you, and yeah, yeah,

I sort of get interested in someone

else, and that went further than it

should have, so it seemed like a

good time to go.  But I have no idea

what will happen with Ian in the

long run.  Probably nothing.

ROB

Well then why don't you quit it while

you seem to not be ahead?

ROB

-- When the whole sorry tale comes

out in a great big lump like that,

even the most shortsighted jerk,

even the most self-deluding and self

pitying of jilted, wounded lovers

can see that there is some cause and

effect going on here, that abortions

and Ian and money and affairs all

belong to, all deserve each other.

LAURA

Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll

get it together, you and me.  Maybe

I'll never see either of you again.

I don't know.  All I know is that

it's not a good time to be living

here.

ROB

So, what, you haven't definitely

decide to dump me?  There's still a

chance we'll get back together?

LAURA

I don't know.

ROB

Well, if you don't know, there's a

chance, right?  It's like, if someone

was in the hospital and he was

seriously ill and the doctor said, I

don't know if he's got a chance of

survival or not, then that doesn't

mean the patient's definitely going

to die, now does it?  It means he

might live.  Even if it's only a

remote possibility.

LAURA

I suppose so.

ROB

So we have a chance of getting back

together again.

LAURA

Oh, Rob, shut up.

ROB

Hey, I just want to know where I

stand.  What chance --

LAURA

-- I don't fucking know what chance

you fucking have!

ROB

Well if you could tell me roughly it

would help.

LAURA

Okay, okay, we have a nine percent

chance of getting back together.

Does that clarify the situation?

ROB

Yeah.  Great.

LAURA

(shaking her head)

I'm too tired for this now.  I know

I'm asking a lot, but will you take

off for a while so I can get my stuff

packed up?  I need to be able to

think while I do it and I can't think

while you're here.

ROB

No problem.  If I can ask one

question.

LAURA

Fine.  One.

ROB

It sounds stupid.

LAURA

Nevermind.

ROB

You won't like it.

LAURA

Just ask it!

ROB

Is it better?

LAURA

Is what better?  Better than what?

ROB

Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with

him better?

LAURA

Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really

what's bothering you?

ROB

Of course it is.

LAURA

You really think it would make a

difference either way?

ROB

I don't know.

LAURA

Well the answer is that I don't know

either.  We haven't done it yet.

ROB

Never?

LAURA

I haven't felt like it.

ROB

But not even before, when he was

living upstairs?

LAURA

No.  I was living with you, remember?

We've slept together but we haven't

made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell

you one thing.  The sleeping together

is better.

ROB

(trying not to smile)

The sleeping together is better but

not the sex because you haven't done

it was him yet.

LAURA

Will you please just go?

CUT TO:

ROB

I feel good!  I feel great!  I feel

like a new man.  I feel so much

better, in fact --

ROB

Hi, Marie.

MARIE

Everything go alright?

ROB

She just wanted to pick up some stuff.

No big thing.  A relief, actually.

MARIE

God, I hate that time.  That pick up

stuff time.  I just went through

that before I came here.  You know

that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I

play?  That's about me and my ex

dividing up our record collections.

ROB

It's a great song.

MARIE

Thank you.

ROB

Is that why you came to Chicago in

the first place?  Because of, you

know, dividing up your record

collection and stuff?

MARIE

Yup.

ROB

You share a place with T-Bone?

MARIE

No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I

wouldn't want to listen to all that

stuff happening on the other side of

the bedroom wall.  I'm way to

unattached for that.

ROB

I understand completely.

ROB (V.O.)

Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I

agreed that what really matters is

what you like, not what you are

like...

MARIE

Yeah, but if you heard this band

called the Crumblers, you'd --

ROB

What do you mean, the Crumblers?

You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's

heard the Crumblers.  Except me.

MARIE

Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought

a used Blasters album in New York

about ten years ago and somebody

left a Crumblers single in it.  My

everything changed for a couple of

weeks.

ROB (V.O.)

Books, records, films -- these things

matter.  Call me shallow but it's

the damn truth, and by this measure

I was having one of the best dates

of my life.

ROB

Yeah, but you know what's his best

film and nobody's even seen it?

MARIE

The Conformist.

ROB

Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!

MARIE

(laughs)

You haven't even seen it!

ROB

Nor have you!

ROB (V.O.)

References, titles, lyrics, flew and

met each other in mid-air embraces.

The evening goes with breathtaking

precision.

MARIE

Are you okay?

ROB

(nodding)

Yes.  You?

MARIE

For now.  But I wouldn't be if I

thought this was the end of the

evening.

ROB

I'm sure it isn't.

MARIE

Good.  In that case, I'll fix us

something else to drink.  You sticking

to the whiskey or you want coffee?

ROB

Whiskey.

MARIE

Tops off two whiskeys and starts

into the other room where she sees

Rob, standing and holding his jacket.

ROB

I'd better go.  I gotta get up early.

Go over to my parents'.

MARIE

When I said before that I hoped it

wasn't the end of the evening, I

was, you know... talking about

breakfast and stuff.

MARIE

I'd like it if you could stay the

night.

ROB

(as if it is dawning

on him)

Oh, right.  Alright.

MARIE

Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged

you for a master of understatement,

beating around the bush and all that

buzz.

ROB

I use it but I don't understand it

when other people use it.

MARIE

So you'll stay?

ROB

Yeah.

MARIE

Good.

ROB

(to camera)

Over nine million men in this country

have slept with ten or more women.

And do they all look like Richard

Gere?  Are they all as rich as Bill

Gates?  Charming as Oscar Wilde?

Hell no.  Nothing to do with any of

that.  Maybe fifty or so have one or

more of these attributes, but that

still leaves... well, about nine

million, give or take fifty.  And

they're just men.  Regular guys.

We're just guys, because I, even I,

am a member of this exclusive, nine

million member club.  In fact, Marie

is my seventeenth lover. "How does

he do it?" you ask. "He wears bad

sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke,

he hangs out with the Musical Moron

Twins, and he gets to go to bed with

a recording artist who looks like

Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan.  What's

going on?  Listen up, because I think

I can explain, with all modesty aside:

I ask questions.  That's it.  That's

my secret.  It works precisely because

that isn't how you're supposed to do

it, if you listen to the collective

male wisdom.  There are still enough

old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs

running around to make someone like

me appear to be refreshingly

different.  If you can't hack this

simple strategy, there are some women

out there, of course, who want to

get pushed around, ignored and mowed

over, but do you really want to be

with them anyway?

ROB

Would you like me to turn the lights

out?  Or would you like them on?

MARIE

God, you ask a lot of questions.

ROB (V.O.)

But in the morning we were just two

people, slightly hung-over, who were

not in love, sharing the same space.

And I feel...

ROB

Sex is about the only grown-up thing

that I know how to do; It's weird,

then, that it's the only thing that

can make me feel like a ten-year-

old.

ROB

Which way are you going?

MARIE

(points left)

That way.  You?

ROB

(points right)

That way.

MARIE

And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.

ROB

I'll call you.

MARIE

(smiles)

Right.

ROB

Okay.  Top five side one track ones.

Number one... "Janie Jones," the

Clash, from The Clash.

BARRY

Ehh.

ROB

"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen,

from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen

Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.

BARRY

Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough.

Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?

ROB

Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin

Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag,"

Radiohead, from OK Computer.

BARRY

(sarcastic)

Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's

sly declaration of new classic-status

slipped into a list of old classics!

Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't

you make it more obvious than that?

DICK

Rob.  Phone.

(whispers)

It's Laura.

ROB

Hi.

LAURA

Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope

of my receipts from last month and

I'm thinking I didn't take them with

me.  Have you seen them around?

ROB

I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?

LAURA

I'm sorry to call, but I need that

stuff...

ROB

Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at

home.  I'll call you when I find it,

and then we'll talk.

LAURA

We'll talk some other time.

ROB

Great... That's great.

BARRY

Rob!  What about the Beatles?  What

about the fucking Rolling Stones?

What about fucking... fucking...

Beethoven?  Track one side one of

the Fifth Symphony?  You shouldn't

be allowed to run a record shop.

You shouldn't be allowed to --

ROB (V.O.)

There's something different about

the sound of her voice... And what

did she mean last night, she hasn't

slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does

"yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't

seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does

that mean?  It means you're going to

go, doesn't it?

BARRY

-- You're like a little squirrel of

music, storing away dead little nuts

of old garbage music, musical lint,

old shit, shit, shit --

ROB

-- Barry, if I were to say to you I

haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what

would that mean?

ROB

Just... come on, what would it mean

to you?  That sentence? "I haven't

seen Evil Dead II yet?"

BARRY

To me, it would mean that you're a

liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with

Laura -- oops -- once with me and

Dick.  We had that conversation about

the possibilities of the guy making

ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth

Century.

ROB

Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't

seen it and I said to you, "I haven't

seen Evil Dead II yet," what would

you think?

BARRY

I'd think you were a cinematic idiot.

And I'd feel sorry for you.

ROB

No, but would you think, from that

one sentence.  That I was going to

see it?

BARRY

I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling

here.  I don't understand any part

of this conversation.  You're asking

me what I would think if you told me

that you hadn't seen a film that

you've seen.  What am I supposed to

say?

ROB

Just listen to me.  If I said to you --

BARRY

"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet,"

yeah, yeah, I hear you --

ROB

Would you... would you get the

impression that I wanted to see it?

BARRY

Well... you couldn't have been

desperate to see it, otherwise you'd

have already gone...

BARRY

...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you

know what, I'd get the impression

that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise

you'd say you didn't really want to.

ROB

But in your opinion, would I

definitely go?

BARRY

How the fuck am I supposed to know

that?  You might get sick of people

telling you you've really gotta go

see the movie.

ROB

Why would they care?

BARRY

Because it's a brilliant film.  It's

funny, violent, and the soundtrack

kicks fucking ass.

BARRY

I never thought I would say this,

but can I go work now?

ROB

Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a

customer in four hours.

BARRY

Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7

o'clock.

ROB

Ha.

DICK

I can't go to the club tonight, guys.

BARRY

Why?

BARRY

Who are you going to see?

DICK

Nobody.

BARRY

Rob, looky looky.  Dick!  Are you

getting some?!

BARRY

Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out

on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie

LaSalle, and the best-looking and

most intelligent of all of us isn't

getting anything at all.

ROB

How do you know about that?

BARRY

Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot?

I'm more bothered by Dick's thing.

How did this happen, Dick?  What

rational explanation can there

possibly be?  What's her name?

DICK

Anna.

BARRY

Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna

Conda?

DICK

Anna Moss.

BARRY

Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing.

The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green

and furry?

ROB

Shut the fuck up, Barry.

BARRY

Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't

you?  You two have to stick together

now.  Boners United.  United in

getting some.

ROB

Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find

true love someday.

BARRY

Suck my ass.

ROB

Terrific.

ROB

Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's

an asshole.

DICK

Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow,

Rob.

ROB

Why does it bother Barry that much

that Dick is seeing someone?  He's

worried about how his life is turning

out, and he's lonely, and lonely

people are the bitterest of them

all.

ROB

(into phone)

Hi.  It's me... I'm right outside...

I know... I know... I figured I could

just walk you to the train and you

could go... home.  Or whatever it

is... No!  Of course not -- okay.

I'll be right here.

ROB (V.O.)

Laura looks different.  Less stress-

out, more in control.  Something has

happened, maybe something real, or

maybe something in her head.  Whatever

it is, you can see that she thinks

she's started out on some new stage

in her life.  She hasn't.  I'm not

going to let her.

LAURA

So, how are you?

ROB

Have you slept with him yet?

LAURA

I told you I slept with him.

ROB

No, not -- I mean have you, you know --

LAURA

Is that why you wanted to see me?

ROB

I guess.

LAURA

Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to

say?

ROB

I want you to say that you haven't,

and I want it to be the truth.

LAURA

I can't do that.

ROB

Tonight we're gonna figure out the

five best angry songs about women.

Let's go...

ROB

You kind of have to start with Elvis

Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?"

"I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy

Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records

should be sealed in cases that say

"in case of vicious betrayal, smash

glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last

Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson

or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair

track.  There are a couple to get

angry at instead of being angry with.

Some devil's advocate stuff.  The

Silver Jews could be good when you're

ready to start putting it all behind

you...  But I think we're getting

ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan.

Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan

would --The phone rings.  He pulls

off his headphones and picks it up

but says nothing.

LAURA (O.S.)

You must have known it would happen.

You couldn't have been entirely

unprepared.  Like you said, I've

been living with the guy.  We were

bound to get around to it sometime.

LAURA (O.S.)

(machine)

And anyway, I keep trying to tell

you, that's not really the point, is

it?  The point is we got ourselves

into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you

there?  What are you thinking?

ROB

(barely a whisper)

Nothing.

LAURA (O.S.)

We can meet for another drink if you

want.  So I can explain it better.

I owe you that much.

ROB

Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you

know.

LAURA (O.S.)

Will you call me?

ROB

I don't have your number.

LAURA (O.S.)

Call me at work.  We can arrange to

meet properly.  I don't want this to

be the last conversation we have.  I

know what you're like.

ROB

You do, huh.

ROB

Yes, a residence, a Mr. Ian Raymond,

North Side... thank you.

ROB

You know the worst thing about being

rejected?  The complete lack of

control due to loss of control.

ROB

If I could only control the when and

how of being dumped by somebody then

it wouldn't seem as bad.  But then,

of course --

ROB

-- it wouldn't be rejection, would

it?  It would be mutual consent.  It

would be musical differences.  I

would be pursuing a solo career.

CUT TO:

LAURA

Hello.

ROB

It's me.

LAURA

I figured it was.

(re: traffic noise)

Where are you?

ROB

I think the big question here is

where are you, if you don't mind my

saying so, and I think I know where

you are.  You're running.  On the

run.  You're running from a point

that everyone hits in any

relationship, and you're just going

to hit it again with Ian but it's

going to be with a World Music bunny-

rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing

"Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't

really understand you, not the way

that I do and will more in the future,

and you'll have just wasted more

time and arrive in the exact same

place that you're in now, only later.

And with... him.

LAURA

I'm not -- hold on...

LAURA

I'm not in love with Ian, okay?

ROB

Are you still in love with me?

LAURA

Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to

you later.

ROB

Think about what I said.  I mean, if

you want to experiment, or whatever --

LAURA

(indignant)

I'm not experimenting.  Why don't

you go experiment.

ROB

I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I

love you.

LAURA

You don't ever think about other

people?

ROB

No... not really... I mean, I think

about it... but no, I don't really

think about it.

IAN (O.S.)

(through the door)

Laura?  Are you okay?

LAURA

(covering the

mouthpiece, to Ian)

I am fine...

(to Rob)

I gotta go.  Goodbye.

IAN

Are you sure you're okay?

LAURA

Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.

IAN

You look upset.

LAURA

I'm upset, but I'm fine.

IAN

Maybe I should talk to him.

LAURA

Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.

IAN

Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.

LAURA

Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get

a drink.

LAURA

(waving toward the

door)

C'mon, c'mon.

ROB

I wish I could be one of those guys

who doesn't call, the kind of guy

that gets broken up with and appears

not to give a shit.  He doesn't make

an ass out of himself, or frighten

anybody, and this week I've done

both of those things.  One day Laura's

sorry and guilty, and the next she's

scared and angry, and I'm entirely

responsible for the transformation,

and it doesn't do my case any good

at all.  I'd stop if I could but I --

ROB

Do I know you?

ALISON'S MOM

I don't know.

ROB

You're Mrs. Ashworth.  I'm Rob.  An

old boyfriend of you're daughter's.

ROB

Alison's.

ALISON'S MOM

Really.

ROB

Long time ago.  I was just thinking

about her.  I was her first boyfriend.

ROB

Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior

high...

ALISON'S MOM

I hate to quibble with you Rob, but

she married her first boyfriend.

Kevin Bannister.

ROB

You gotta be kidding me.

ALISON'S MOM

That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs.

Kevin Bannister.  She lives in

Australia.

ROB

Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior

high sweetheart... What chance would

I have had against that?  None, no

chance.  That's just fate.

ALISON'S MOM

I beg your pardon?

ROB

Technically, I'm number one.  I went

out with her a week before Kevin

did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.

ALISON'S MOM

Well Rob, I'll tell her you said

hello.  If she remembers you.

ROB

(calling after her)

I think she will.  But it's okay if

she doesn't.  I'm fine now.

ROB

And suddenly I am fine.  For the

moment there is not one extra pound

on my chest.  This is fate.  Alison

married Kevin.  You get it?  That's

fate.  That's got nothing to do with

me, that is beyond my control, beyond

my fault...

CUT TO:

ROB

I want to see the others on the Big

Top Five.  Penny, who wouldn't let

me touch her and then went and had

sex with that bastard Chris Thompson.

Sarah, my partner in rejection who

rejected me, and Charlie, who I have

to thank for everything: my great

job, my sexual self-confidence, the

works.  There's this Springsteen

song, "Bobby Jean," off Born in the

USA.  About a girl who's left town

years before and he's pissed off

because he didn't know about it, and

he wanted to say goodbye, tell her

that he missed her, and wish her

good luck.  Well, I'd like my life

to be like a Springsteen song.  Just

once.  I know I'm not born to run,

and it's clear that Halsted Street

is nothing like Thunder Road, but

feelings can't be that different,

can they?  I'd like to call up all

those people and ask them how they

are and whether they've forgiven me,

and tell them that I have forgiven

them.  And say good luck, goodbye.

No hard feelings.  And then they'd

feel good and I'd feel good.  We'd

all feel good.  I'd feel clean, and

calm, and ready to start again.

That'd be good.  Great even.

ROB

Penny Hardwick?  This is Rob Gordon...

From High school... Yeah.

ROB (V.O.)

Penny is as beautiful as she was in

high school when I broke it off with

her because she wouldn't sleep with

me.  In fact she's even more

beautiful, and really grown into

herself.

ROB (V.O.)

She tells me about her life, and I

get it.  And I tell about mine, and

she's interested.

ROB (V.O.)

And then, with no real explanation,

I just launch into it: I tell her

about Laura and Ian, and Charlie and

Marco, and about Alison Ashworth and

Kevin Bannister...

ROB

...and you wanted to sleep with Chris

Thompson instead of me, and... and I

thought you could help me understand

why it keeps happening, why I'm doomed

to be left, doomed to be rejected

and...

PENNY

Rob.  I was crazy about you.  I wanted

to sleep with you, one day, but not

when I was sixteen.  When you broke

up with me -- when you broke up with

me -- because I was, to use your

charming expression, tight, I cried

and cried and I hated you.  And then

that little shitbag asked me out,

and I was too tired to fight him

off, and it wasn't rape because I

said okay, but it wasn't far off.

And I didn't have sex with anyone

else until after college because I

hated it so much.  And now you want

to have a chat about rejection?

Well, fuck you, Rob.

ROB

(cheerful)

So that's another one I don't have

to worry about.  I should have done

this years ago.

ROB

Check...

ROB

Sarah's easy to find.  She still

sends me Christmas cards with her

address and phone number on them.

They never say anything else, except

for "Merry Christmas, Love Sarah." I

send her equally blank ones back.

SARAH

I can't believe I left you for him...

Crazy.

ROB

Well... probably seemed like a good

idea at the time.

SARAH

Probably.  I can't remember why,

though.

ROB (V.O.)

I haven't got the heart for the

rejection conversation.  There are

no hard feelings here, and I am glad

that she ditched me, and not the

other way around.

ROB

I could've ended up having sex back

there.  And what better way to

exorcize rejection demons than to

screw the person who rejected you,

right?  But you wouldn't be sleeping

with a person.  You'd be sleeping

with a whole sad single-person

culture.  It'd be like sleeping with

Talia Shire in "Rocky" if you weren't

Rocky.

CUT TO:

ROB

Charlie's in the fucking phone book.

She has come to assume such an

importance, I feel she should be

living on Mars.  She's an

extraterrestrial, a ghost, a myth,

not a person with an answering

machine, in the phone book... I call

and hang up on her voice mail a couple

of times, then I leave my name and

number and throw in a "long time-no-

see..." I don't hear anything back

from her for a few days.  Now that's

more like it, if you're talking about

rejection: someone who won't even

return your phone messages a decade

after she rejected you.

ROB

Can I help you?

IAN

Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray.

Ian.

IAN

I thought maybe we should talk.

Sort a few things out?

ROB

What needs sorting out?

IAN

Come on, Rob.  My relationship with

Laura has obviously disturbed you a

great deal.

ROB

Funnily enough I haven't been too

thrilled about it.

IAN

We are not talking jokey

understatement here, Rob.  We're

talking actionable harassment.  Ten

phone calls a night, hanging around

outside my house...

ROB

Yeah, well, I've stopped all that

now.

IAN

We've noticed and we're glad.  But,

you know... how are we going to make

peace here?  We want to make things

easier for you.  What can we do?

Obviously I know how special Laura

is, and I know things can't be good

for you at the moment.  I'd hate it

if I lost her.  But I'd like to think

that if she decided she didn't want

to see me anymore, I'd respect that

decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?

ROB

Yeah.

IAN

Good.  So shall we leave it at that

then?

ROB

I dunno.

IAN

Think about it, Rob.

IAN

Good.  So shall we leave it at that

then?

ROB

I've already left it, you pathetic

rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli

stink out of my store.

IAN

Good.  So shall we leave it at that

then?

ROB

We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.

DICK

Don't do it, Rob!

BARRY

He's not worth it!

ROB

Leave town.  Leave the country, you

little bitch, because you're gonna

look back on walks by the house and

ten phone calls a night as a golden

age.  Get ready, mutherfucker.

IAN

So shall we leave it at that then?

ROB

I dunno.

IAN

Think about it, Rob.

DICK

Phone, Rob.  Somebody named Charlie.

BATHROOM

Rob curls up with the phone.

ROB

Hello?

CHARLIE

Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call.

In LA on business.  You know how it

gets.

ROB

Yeah, sure...

CHARLIE

Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob

Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million

years ago now.

ROB

Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are

you?

CHARLIE

Fantastic but I'm a little busy right

now.  Listen.  Do you want to come

to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some

friends over and I need a spare man.

Are you a spare man?

ROB

Uh...yes, at the moment.

CHARLIE

Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.

CUT TO:

ROB

Hey Charlie.

CHARLIE

Hey Rob.

ROB

Why did you break up with me for

Marco?

CHARLIE

(on her feet)

Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going

through one of those what-does-it-

all-mean things.

ROB

Huh?

CHARLIE

There's been a rash of them, recently.

I find it a little unnerving.  In

fact Marco called a few months back,

and he wanted to see me, and rehash

the past as they say, and I wasn't

really up for it.  Do all men go

through this?

ROB

C'mon, just answer the question.

You can say what you like.  What the

hell?

CHARLIE

It's all kind of lost in the... in

the dense mists of time now... It

wasn't that I really liked Marco

more.  In fact I thought you were

more, shall we say, attractive than

him.  It was just that he knew he

was good-looking and you didn't, and

that made a difference somehow.  You

used to act as if I was weird for

wanting to spend time with you, and

that got kind of beat, if you know

what I mean.  Your self-image started

to rub off on me and I ended up

thinking that I was strange.  And I

knew that you were kind and

thoughtful... you made me laugh, and

I dug the way you got consumed by

things you loved... and Marco seemed

a bit more, I don't know, glamorous?

More sure of himself?

(pause)

Less hard work, because I felt like

I was dragging you around, sort of.

(pause)

A little sunnier.  Sparkier.

(pause)

I don't know.  You know what people

are like at that age.  They make

very superficial judgements.  Do you

think that's superficial?  He was a

clown, if it's any consolation.

ROB

Did you tell that to Marco when he

did his what-does-it-all-mean thing

with you?

CHARLIE

Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt

his feelings.

CUT TO:

ROB

I wanted the works and I got it.

None of Alison Ashworth's fate, none

of Sarah's rewriting of history, and

no reminder that I'd got all the

rejection stuff a little backward,

like I did about Penny.  Just a

perfectly clear explanation of why

some people have it and some don't.

All I've learned from Charlie is

that maybe my one talent, my genius

for being normal, is a little

overrated.

CUT TO:

BARRY

Hey.

ROB

What the fuck is that?

BARRY

My band.

ROB

What band?

BARRY

The band that found me and asked me

to join.

ROB

You are not in a band, Barry.  You

are not a musician.  And no posters.

BARRY

Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really

appreciate it.

ROB

Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no

end to your arrogance?

BARRY

I didn't make up the name.  It's the

Steely Dan song.  And it was in The

Commitments.

ROB

You can't be called Barry and sing

in a group called Barrytown.

BARRY

They were fucking called that before

I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my

idea.

ROB

That's why you got the gig, isn't

it?

ROB

Isn't it?

BARRY

That was one of the reasons they

asked me to join originally, yes.

But --

ROB

Great!  That's fucking great!  They

only asked you to sing because of

your name!  You can stick it above

the browser racks over there.

BARRY

How many tickets can I put you down

for?

ROB

None.  Christ!

BARRY

You're not even coming?

ROB

Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look

like I'd want to listen to some

terrible experimental racket played

in some hideous cave?  Where is it?

(looks at the poster)

The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!

BARRY

So much for friends, then.  You're a

bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?

ROB

Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown?

You should be shot like a lame horse,

you jerk.

(re: the poster)

Just keep that out of my window.

LAURA

I called and called but you were

out.  I thought I'd be gone before

you got back.

ROB

Is that the last of it?

LAURA

Yep.  I might have missed some stuff.

I'm so used to some things being

here that I don't even notice them.

ROB

Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?

LAURA

He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe

he went to the store.  I'm mortified,

actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had

no right to do that, and I told him

so.

ROB

It was kind of funny.

LAURA

I'm sure.

ROB

You still together?  Going all right?

LAURA

I don't really want to talk about

it, to be honest.

ROB

That bad, eh?

LAURA

You know what I mean.

ROB

It's a dump, isn't it?

LAURA

Fix it up.  It'll make you feel

better.

ROB

I'll bet you can't remember what you

were doing here, can you?  I mean,

how much are you making now?  Sixty?

Seventy?  And you were living in

this shitty place.

LAURA

You know I didn't mind.  And it's

not as if Ray's place is any better.

ROB

I'm sorry, but can we get this

straight?  What is his fucking name,

Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?

LAURA

Ray.  I hate Ian.

ROB

I hate him too.  So I just call him

"Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis

the Sissyboy."

ROB

This is where you're supposed to say

that you haven't laughed this much

in ages, and then you see the error

of your ways.

LAURA

You make me laugh much more than Ray

does, if that's what you're getting

at.  But I already knew you could

make me laugh.  It's everything else

I don't know about.

ROB

You know I'm a good person.

LAURA

Mmm hmm.

ROB

You know that I can cook my ass off

when I feel like it.

LAURA

Oh ho, so very infrequently.

ROB

You know my favorite beverage is

your bath water.

LAURA

Time to go.

ROB

Don't forget your CDs.

LAURA

Those aren't mine.

ROB

Sure they are.

LAURA

They're not really, though, are they?

I know you bought them for me, and

that was really sweet of you, but

that was when you were trying to

turn me into you.  I can't take them,

I know they'd just sit around staring

at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by

them and... they don't fit in with

the rest of what's mine, do you

understand?  That Sting record you

bought for me... that was a present

for me.  I like Sting and you hate

him.  But the rest of this stuff...

(bending down to the

pile)

Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram

Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't

know these people.  I...

ROB

Okay, okay.  I get the picture.

LAURA

I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I

don't know, there's a lesson here

somewhere, and I want to make sure

you get it.

ROB

I got it.  You like Sting but you

don't like Gram Parsons, because

you've never heard of him.

LAURA

You're being deliberately obtuse.

ROB

I guess I am.

LAURA

Well, think about it.

ROB

Fuck.

CUT TO:

ROB

What's the point in thinking about

it?  If I ever have another

relationship, I'll buy her, whoever

she is, stuff that she oughta like

but doesn't know about -- that's

what new boyfriends are for.  And

hopefully I won't borrow money from

her, or have an affair, and she won't

need to have an abortion or run away

with the neighborhood, and then there

won't be anything to think about.

Laura didn't run off with Ian because

I bought her CDs she wasn't that

keen on, and to pretend otherwise is

just... just... psychowank.  If she

thinks that, then she's missing the

Brazilian rainforest for the twigs.

If I can't buy the Plastic People of

the Universe's first album for new

girlfriends, then I might as well

give up, because I'm not sure I know

how to do anything else.

CUT TO:

LAURA (O.S.)

(muffled, almost a

whisper)

Hello.

ROB

Hey, how ya doin'?

ROB

Guess who I just saw, right by my

store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat,

huh?

LAURA (O.S.)

I can't talk right now.

ROB

God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe

you should bet back in bed.

ROB

Are you alright?

LAURA (O.S.)

Pigsty.

ROB

Don't worry about it.  Just get into

bed.  Worry about that when you're

better.

LAURA (O.S.)

Pig died.

ROB

Who the fuck's Pig?

LAURA (O.S.)

(louder)

My dad died.  My dad, my dad.

BARRY

What's up?

ROB

Laura.  Her dad died.

BARRY

Ooh.  Drag.

DICK

I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --

ROB

You're a horrible person, Barry.  I

mean it.

BARRY

Hey.  Top five songs about death.  A

Laura's Dad Tribute list.

BARRY

Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack."

The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle

and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve,"

Jan and Dean...

DICK

Did you know that after that song

was recorded, Jan himself crashed

his --

BARRY

-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.

ROB

It was Jan, and it was a long time

after--

BARRY

Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love

Her." That'd bring the house down.

Laura's mom could sing it.

ROB

Fuck off, Barry.

BARRY

I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness.

And "You Can't Always Get What You

Want."

ROB

Because it's in The Big Chill.

BARRY

Haven't seen it.

ROB

Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence

Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.

BARRY

Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about

that.  I wasn't biting the idea.

ROB

Not really.

ROB

Record Exchange.

LAURA

I'm sorry.

ROB

No, no.  When are you going home?

LAURA

In a minute.  When I get it together.

BARRY

(to Dick)

What about Sabbath?  Or Nirvana?

They're into death.

ROB

Can I do anything?

DICK

"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's

a nice one.

BARRY

"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz.

"Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus.

It's got that creepy Halloween

feeling.

LAURA

No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to

the funeral.  It's on Friday.

ROB

Me?

LAURA

My dad liked you.  And Mom never

told him we'd split, because he wasn't

up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I

don't really understand it.  I think

she thinks he'll be able to see what's

going on.  It's like...

(small laugh)

He's been through so much, what with

dying and everything, that she doesn't

want to upset him any more than she

has to.

ROB

Do you want me to be there?

LAURA

I don't care.  As long as you don't

expect me to hold your hand.

LAURA

Look, are you coming or not?

ROB

Yes, of course.

LAURA

Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows

where to go and everything... I don't

have time to talk, Rob.  I've got

too much to do.

ROB

Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.

BARRY

(to the tune of "Candle

In the Wind")

"Goodbye Laura's dad/blah blah la di

da di da/

(belting it out)

Seems to me/you lived your life/like

a dentist in the wind...

ROB

So the minister says nice things,

and then, what, we all troop outside

and they bury him?

LIZ

It's a crematorium.

ROB

You're kidding.  A crematorium?

Jesus.

LIZ

What difference does it make?

ROB

Is Ray going?

LIZ

No.  They don't know him.  And Ken

liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for

your benefit, you know.  It's like

everybody's a supporting actor in

the film of your life story.

ROB

Isn't that how it is for everybody?

MINISTER

...Now and forever, Amen.

ROB (V.O.)

I hear something in Laura's voice,

but I know what it is, and at that

moment I want to go to her and offer

to become a different person, to

remove all trace of what is me, as

long as she will let me look after

her and try to make her feel better...

ROB (V.O.)

...And when she let's go of me, I

feel I don't need to become a

different person.  It's happened

already.

LIZ

(to Jo)

How are you?

JO

I'm all right, I suppose.  And Mom's

not too bad.  But Laura... I dunno.

LIZ

She's had a pretty rough few weeks

already, without this.  It's hard

when you're putting all of your

efforts into one part of your life

and it doesn't work out.

ROB

(sincere)

Don't mind me.  No problem.  Just

pretend you're talking about somebody

else.

LIZ

We are talking about somebody else.

Laura.  Laura and Ray, actually.

ROB

Enough, Liz.

LIZ

Enough of what?

ROB

(getting louder)

I know I can't speak now because

Laura's father died, and I just have

to take it because otherwise I'm a

bad guy, with the emphasis on guy,

self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking

not, not all the time, anyway, I'm

really sorry Jo.

(lowering his voice)

But you know, Liz... I can either

stick up for myself or believe

everything you say about me and end

up hating myself.  And maybe you

think I should, but it's not much of

a life, you know?

LIZ

Maybe I've been a little unfair.

But is this really the time?

ROB

Only because it's never the time.  I

can't go on apologizing my whole

life, you know?

LIZ

If by "we" you are referring to men,

then I have to say that just the

once would do.

ROB

I'm sorry.

LAURA

Are you going to lie in that flower

bed all night?

ROB

Uh... No.

LAURA

You're soaking.

ROB

Mmnn.

LAURA

You're also an idiot.

ROB

I can see why you say that.  Look,

I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last

thing I wanted was... that's why I

left, because... I lost it, and I

didn't want to blow my top in there,

and... look, the reason I fucked

everything up was because I was

scared.  I just wanted you to know,

that's all.

LAURA

Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't

reciprocate.

ROB

What do you mean?

LAURA

I didn't mess things up because I

was scared.  I slept with Ray because

I was sick of you.  And I needed

something to snap me out of it.

ROB

Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't

want to take up any more of your

time.  You get back, and I'll wait

here for a bus.

LAURA

I don't want to go back.

ROB

What do you want to do?

LAURA

C'mon.

ROB

When are you going back?

LAURA

I don't know.  Sometime.  Later.

Listen, Rob, would you have sex with

me?

ROB

What?

LAURA

I want to feel something else than

this.  It's either that or I go home

and put my hand in the fire.  Unless

you want to stub cigarettes out on

my arm.

ROB

I've only got a couple left.  I'm

saving them for later.

LAURA

It'll have to be sex, then.

LAURA

Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago

that I looked at you from here.

ROB

Hi.

LAURA

I knew there was a reason I wore a

skirt today.

ROB

You know, with Ray...

LAURA

Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through

that again.

ROB

No, no.  It's not... are you still

on the pill?

LAURA

Yes, of course.  There's nothing to

worry about.

ROB

I didn't mean that.  I mean... was

that all you used?

ROB

Look, we can do other things.

LAURA

I lived with you.  You were my partner

just a few weeks ago and now you're

worried I might kill you, and you're

entitled to worry.  Isn't that a

terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?

CUT TO:

ROB

Later, I wonder if I was really

worried about where Ian has been.  I

have no idea where he's been, and

that gives me every right to insist

on protection.  But in truth, it was

the power that interested me more

than the fear.  I wanted to hurt

her, on this day of all days, just

because it's the first time since

she's left that I've been able to.

ROB

Laura...

LAURA

I'm too tired not to go out with

you.

ROB

So if you had a bit more energy we'd

stay split.  But things being how

they are, what with you wiped out,

you'd like us to get back together.

LAURA

(nodding)

Everything's too hard.  Maybe another

time I would have the guts to be on

my own, but not now I don't.

ROB

What about Ian?

LAURA

Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what

that was all about, except that

sometimes you need someone to lob

into the middle of a bad relationship

like a hand grenade, I guess, and

blow it all apart.

ROB

Mission accomplished.

LAURA

I know it's not very romantic, but

there will be romance again at some

stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need

you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know

each other and we care for each other,

and you've made it clear that you

want me back, so...

LAURA

Let's go home.  Okay?

ROB

Okay.

CUT TO:

ROB

But wouldn't you know it?  Suddenly

I feel panicky, and sick, and I want

to run around and sleep with female

recording artists...

CUT TO:

ROB

C'mon.  I want to know.

LAURA

Want to know what, exactly?

ROB

What it was like.

LAURA

It was like sex.  What else could it

be like?

ROB

Was it like good sex or was it like

bad sex?

LAURA

What's the difference?

ROB

You know the difference.

LAURA

Look, we're okay now.  We just had a

nice time.  Let's leave it at that.

ROB

Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the

nice time we just had... was it nicer,

as nice, or less nice than the nice

times you were having a couple of

weeks ago?

ROB

Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something.

Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking

you questions and it'd make me feel

better.

LAURA

Well I was gonna lie and now I can't,

because you'd know I was lying.

ROB

Well why the fuck would you want to

lie, anyway?

LAURA

To make you feel better.

ROB

Oh, great...

LAURA

Look, Rob.  If great sex was as

important as you think it is, and if

I was having great sex with him,

then we wouldn't be lying here now.

And that is my last word on the

subject, okay?

ROB

Okay.

LAURA

I wish your penis was as big as his,

though.

LAURA

... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or

New York, even.

ROB

Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is,

tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box

full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on

the Sub label, and I'll pay for it

that way.

LAURA

I'll pay for you.  Even though you

owe me money.  We have to do something

with the money I earn.  I need to.

I deserve it.  You can just think of

it as winning the lottery.

ROB

Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.

LAURA

Money does not matter.  I do not

care how much you earn.  I'd just

like you to be a little happier in

your work, but beyond that you can

do what you like.

ROB

But it wasn't supposed to be like

this.  When I met you we were the

same people and now we're not, and...

LAURA

How?  How were we the same people?

ROB

Well, you were the kind of person

who came to the Artful Dodger and I

was the kind of person who deejayed

at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans

and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I

still do, and you don't.

LAURA

Because I'm not allowed to.  I still

do, after work.  So, what?  Should

we just break up?  Is that what you're

saying?  Because if you are, I'm

going to run out of patience.

ROB

No, but...

LAURA

But what?

ROB

But why doesn't it matter that we're

not the same people we used to be?

LAURA

You haven't changed so much as a

pair of socks in the years I've known

you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm

the one who's done the growing, and

all I've done is change jobs.

ROB

And hairstyles and clothes and

attitude and friends and...

LAURA

I can't go to work with my hair dyed

pink.  And I can afford to go shopping

more now, and I've met a couple people

I like over the last year or so.

ROB

You're tougher.

LAURA

More confident, maybe.

ROB

Harder.

LAURA

Less neurotic.  Are you intending to

stay the same for the rest of your

life?

ROB

I'm alright.

LAURA

Yeah, you're alright.  But you're

certainly not happy.  So what happens

if you get happy?  And yes I know

that's the title of an Elvis Costello

album, I use the reference

deliberately to catch your attention.

Should we split up because I'm used

to you being miserable?  What happens

if you, I don't know, start you're

own record label, and it's a success?

Time for a new girlfriend?

ROB

You're being stupid.

LAURA

How?  What would be the difference

between you having a record label

and me going from legal aid to private

practice?

LAURA

All I'm saying is, you have to allow

for things to happen to people, most

of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's

the use?

ROB

No use.

ROB

What is this.

DICK

It's Vince and Justin.

ROB

Who's that?

BARRY

The little skate-fuckers.

ROB

No way.

BARRY

Yes way.  It's really...

BARRY

(pained to say it)

It's really fucking good.

ROB

Your tape.  It's good.

ROB

It's rough.  But it shows promise.

We record a couple of songs right,

in a studio.  I'll take care of the

rest.  I'll put out your record.

Any profits after recouping expenses

get split down the middle, between

us and you guys.

VINCE

Wait a minute.  Island Records charged

U2 a million five against their

overhead for one plane ride.

ROB

We're not there yet, Justin.

VINCE

I'm Vince.

ROB

Whatever.

ROB

Hey.  What's the name of your band?

JUSTIN

The Kinky Wizards.

ROB

What?

VINCE

We saw this ad in the personals for

two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance

fair.

ROB

Nice.

VINCE

What's the name of your label?

ROB

Broken Records.  Welcome aboard.

BARRY

What the fuck is that?

ROB

What?

BARRY

I heard you, man.  Don't give me

that "what" shit.  You just told

them that you're gonna put out a

record with them.

ROB

So?  You even said they're good.

BARRY

HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around

here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr.

Phil Spector?

LAURA

Hey, Barry.

BARRY

Oh, hi.

LAURA

Where's Rob?

BARRY

The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street

is in his executive suite.  Do you

have an appointment?

LAURA

What are you talking about?

BARRY

Just that Rob seems to think it would

be wiser to start a record label by

putting out a record with business-

crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters

than with someone he knows in his

bitter jealous heart is a musical

visionary.  That's all.

ROB

Hi.

LAURA

Hi.  What are you doing?

ROB

Nothing.

LAURA

Wanna go to dinner?

ROB

Where?

LAURA

At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from

work.

ROB

Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along.

Paul and I.

LAURA

I know.  But you've never met.  It

just seems like a stone unturned in

your relationship with him.

ROB

Ha.

CUT TO:

ROB

We're at a point where I can't really

walk away from gauntlets she might

throw down, and so I go.  And wouldn't

you know it, I sort of fall in love

with Paul and Miranda -- with what

they have, and the way they treat

each other, and the way they make me

feel as if I'm the new center of

their world.  I think they're great,

and I want to see them twice a week,

every week, for the rest of my life.

Only right at the end of the evening

do I realize I've been set up.

PAUL

Lame, right?

ROB

Oh, I don't know.  The Beatles are

okay.

PAUL

We're kinda out of date.

ROB

Hey, to each his own, I say.

PAUL

Maybe we can come by your store and

you can hook us up.

ROB

Sure, sure.  Any time.

LAURA

Better hurry, though, Paul.  Rob

started a record label, so he's gonna

be in the shop less and less.

CUT TO:

LAURA

..."To each his own!" Unbelievable!

You!  Rob Gordon said that.  You

even sounded like you meant it.

ROB

(smiling)

You did that deliberately.  You knew

all along I'd like them.  It was a

trick.

LAURA

I tricked you into meeting some people

you'd think were great.  I thought

it would be fun to introduce you to

someone with a Tina Turner album and

then see whether you still felt the

same way.

LAURA

I called Dan Koretzky because he --

ROB

Has Drag City Records, I know, I

know.  You told Dan Koretzky about

this?

LAURA

Yeah, and he said it's a good way to

break out a record.  Especially for

what he said, and I quote, "would be

a highly anticipated event, locally."

He helped me put out a press release.

ROB

WHAT?

LAURA

Just local, of course.

ROB

And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob

Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"

LAURA

I had that idea when I was living

with Ian and it was such a good idea

that I was annoyed we weren't together

anymore.  It might even be why I

came back.

ROB

You had no right.  Supposing I was

doing something that couldn't be

cancelled?

LAURA

What do you ever do that can't be

cancelled?

ROB

That's not the point.  I mean, what

if the single isn't done in time?

LAURA

Barry said its done.

ROB

Barry?  Barry knows about this?

LAURA

Yeah.  His band is playing a set.

ROB

Like fuck you are.

BARRY

Laura said we could.  If we helped

out with the posters and stuff.  And

we did.  And we are.

ROB

I'll give you 10% of the door if you

don't play.

BARRY

We're getting that anyway.

ROB

What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.

BARRY

No.  We need the gig.

ROB

110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm

not kidding.  That's how much it

means to me not to hear you play.

BARRY

We're not as bad as you think, Rob.

ROB

You couldn't be.  Look, Barry.

There's going to be people from

Laura's work there, people who own

dogs and babies and Tina Turner

albums.  How are you going to cope

with them?

BARRY

We're not called Barrytown anymore,

by the by.  They got sick of the

Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called

SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.

ROB

Sonic Death Monkey.

BARRY

What do you think?  Dick likes it.

ROB

Barry, you're over thirty years old.

You owe it to yourself and your

friends and to your parents not to

sing in a group called Sonic Death

Monkey.

BARRY

I owe it to myself to go right to

the edge, Rob, and this group does

exactly that.  Over the edge, in

fact.

ROB

You'll be going over the fucking

edge if you come anywhere near me

next Friday night.

BARRY

That's what we want.  Reaction.  And

if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends

can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let

'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll

be ready.

CUT TO:

LAURA

They'll go on early.  Nobody will

even be there yet and I told them

they can't play for more than a half

hour.

ROB

It's no joke.  I'm responsible for

what happens, you know.  Embarrassment

aside, there's a lot of money and

effort in this, at least by my

standards.  I have to put down a

deposit for the room.  I have to pay

the pressing plant for the records,

sleeve them, sticker them --

LAURA

We took care of that.

LAURA

Barry and Dick and me.  Look in the

bedroom.

CUT TO:

ROB

I suddenly feel choked up.  It's not

the money, it's the way she's thought

of everything: one morning I woke up

to find her going through my records,

pulling out things that she remembered

me playing when I deejayed and putting

them into the little carrying cases

that I used to use and put away in a

closet somewhere years ago.  She

knew I needed a kick in the ass.

She also knew how happy I was when I

used to deejay.  From which every

angle I examine it, it still looks

as though she's done all of this

because she loves me.

ROB

I'm sorry I've been acting like a

jerk.  I do appreciate what you've

done for me, and I know you've done

it for the best possible reasons,

and I do love you, even though I act

like I don't.

LAURA

That's okay.  You seem pissed off

all the time, though.

ROB

I know.  I don't get it.

CUT TO:

ROB

But if I had to take a wild guess,

I'd say that I'm pissed because I

know I'm stuck with Laura, bound to

her, and I don't like it.  That dreamy

anticipation you have when you're

fifteen or twenty or thirty even,

that the most perfect person in the

world might walk into your store or

office or friend's party at any

moment... That's all gone, I think,

and that's enough to piss anybody

off.  Laura is who I am now, and

it's no good pretending otherwise...

CUT TO:

CAROLINE

Excuse me?

ROB

May I help you?

CAROLINE

I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.

ROB

Uh.  That's me.

CAROLINE

I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader.

I want to do a story on you.

ROB

Right.  Why?

CAROLINE

Well, I used to go to the Dodger on

your nights, and I saw you're doing

it again and that your putting out a

record, and it's sort of a then-and-

now story against the backdrop of

the Chicago music scene with the

emphasis on now.

ROB

Oh.  Okay.

CAROLINE

I thought I would ask you a few

questions if that's okay.

ROB

Huh.  You used to come to the club?

I shouldn't have let you in.  You

must have only been about sixteen.

ROB

What I mean is, I didn't mean you

look young.  You don't.  You don't

look old either.  You look just as

old as you are.  A bit younger maybe,

but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.

CAROLINE

So.  Is now a good time?

CAROLINE

Right.  So.  You must have an enormous

record collection.

ROB

Yeah.  I could show it to you if you

want to come over and see it.

CAROLINE

Yeah, well... Let's see... What are

you're all-time top five records?

ROB

Pardon me?

CAROLINE

Your desert island top-five.

ROB

Oh boy... In the club, or at home?

CAROLINE

Is there a difference?

ROB

(a little too shrill)

OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin

City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers

is an all-time top five, but I

wouldn't play it at the club.  It's

a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd

go home.

CAROLINE

Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.

ROB

What do you mean, four more?

CAROLINE

Well if one of them is this "Sin

City" thing --

ROB

Can I go home and work this out and

let you know?  In a week or so?

CAROLINE

Look if you can't think of anything,

it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My

five favorite from the old days at

the Dodger.

ROB

Oh, I'm sure I can manage something...

"Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned.

"Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic.

"Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello,

Japanese import, no horns, or

different horns, anyway... um...

"Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley...

And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and

the Family Stone.  A bit

controversial, I know, but...

CAROLINE

Fine.  That's great.

ROB

Is that it?

CAROLINE

Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat,

if you got the time.

ROB

Sure, but is that it for the list?

CAROLINE

That's five.  So.  Why did you decide

to deejay again?

ROB

Well it was a friend's idea, really,

and the record release party seemed

like a good place to do it.  So...

(looking over her pad

at the list)

I should really put a James Brown in

there --

CAROLINE

Nice friend.

ROB

Yeah.

CAROLINE

What's his name?

ROB

Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is

Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a

girl.

CAROLINE

"Music for Old People." What does

that mean?

ROB

Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd

like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch"

Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin

City."

CAROLINE

Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"

ROB

Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't

too old for clubs but they're too

old for acid jazz and garage and

ambient and all that.  They want to

hear old funk and Stax and New Wave

and Old School Hip Hop and some new

stuff all together and there's nowhere

for them.

CAROLINE

And the new label?  And the Kinky

Wizards?

ROB

Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are --

you know what?  Why don't I just

make you a tape?

CAROLINE

Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could

have deejay Rob Gordon play in my

own home.

ROB

Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I

love making tapes.

CUT TO:

ROB

A good compilation tape, like breaking

up, is hard to do and takes ages

longer than it might seem.  You gotta

kick off with a killer, to hold the

attention.  Then you have to take it

up a notch, but not blow your wad,

so maybe cool it off a notch, and

you can't put the same artist twice

on the tape, except if some subtle

point or lesson or theme involved,

and even then not the two of them in

a row, and you can't woo somebody

with Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow

Taxi" and then bash their head off

with something like GBH's "City Baby

Attacked by Rats," and... oh, there

are a lot of rules.  Anyway, I worked

hard at this one.

LAURA

Who's that for?

ROB

This?  Oh, just that woman who

interviewed me for The Reader.  Carol?

Caroline?  Something like that.

ROB

Hi, Caroline... Oh, it's Rob.  Yeah,

listen, I have a new list for you

and -- Oh.  Yes.  Of course...  Well

maybe next week they could print a,

uh, retraction.  Or a correction.

Because the list I have now it really

much more -- right.  Okay.  Anyway,

I have your tape.  That's right.

Shall I mail it to you?  Or... would

you like to have a drink?

CUT TO:

ROB

How are you not going to fall for

someone who wants to interview you?

Now Caroline is all I can think about.

And in the daydreams I imagine every

detail, the entire story of our future

relationship, until suddenly I realize

that there's nothing left to actually,

like, happen.  I've done it all,

lived through it all in my head.  I

know the whole plot, the ending, and

the good parts.  Now I'd have to

watch it all over again in real time,

and where's the fun in that?  And

fucking--when is it all going to

stop?  Am I going to jump from rock

to rock for the rest of my life until

there aren't any rocks left?  Am I

going to bolt every time I get itchy

feet?  Because I get them about once

a quarter, along with the store's

tax bill.  I've been thinking with

my guts since I was fourteen years

old and, frankly speaking, I've come

to the conclusion that my guts have

shit for brains.  You know what's

wrong with Laura, what my problem

is?  What's wrong with Laura is that

I'll never see her for the first or

second or third time.  That's all.

Fuck it.  I'll probably mail the

tape.  Probably.

CUT TO:

LAURA

A drinking lunch on a school day.

What a nice surprise.

LAURA

Are you worried about tomorrow night?

ROB

Not really.

LAURA

Are you going to talk to me, or shall

I get my paper out?

ROB

I'm going to talk to you.

LAURA

Right.

LAURA

What are you going to talk to me

about?

ROB

I'm going to talk to you about whether

you want to get married or not.  To

me.

LAURA

Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.

ROB

I mean it.

LAURA

I know.

ROB

Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.

LAURA

I'm sorry.  But two days ago you

were in love with that girl who

interviewed you for The Reader,

weren't you?

ROB

Not in love, exactly, but...

LAURA

Well forgive me if I don't think of

you as the world's safest bet.

ROB

Would you marry me if I was?

LAURA

No.  Probably not.

ROB

Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?

LAURA

Don't sulk.  What brought all this

on?

ROB

I don't know.

LAURA

Very persuasive.

ROB

Are you persuadable?

LAURA

No.  I don't think so.  I'm just

curious about how one goes from making

tapes for one person to marriage

proposals to another in two days.

Fair enough?

ROB

Fair enough.

LAURA

So?

ROB

I'm just sick of thinking about it

all the time.

LAURA

About what?

ROB

This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I

want to think about something else.

LAURA

I've changed my mind.  That's the

most romantic thing I've ever heard.

I do.  I will.

ROB

Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.

LAURA

I mean, maybe you're right.  But

were you really expecting me to say

yes?

ROB

I dunno.  Didn't think about it,

really.  It was the asking that was

the important thing.

LAURA

Well, you've asked.

LAURA

Thank you.

ROB

Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight.

I hope you have a good time.  And I

hope you like the record.  The one

by the Kinky Wizards.  The record

that we're having this record release

party for.

(hoots from the crowd)

Thanks.  Listen to it first, though.

(laughs)

Okay.  We'll get to that later.

Right now, I'd like to introduce...

(mumbles)

Sonic Death Monkey.

ROB

(to Laura)

I'm an idiot.  I should have played

the record first.  This place is

about to get burned down.

LAURA

It's gonna be fine.  These people

are ready for anything.

BARRY

(dubious)

Yeah, well...

BARRY

Thanks for the enthusiastic intro,

Rob.  We're not called Sonic Death

Monkey anymore, though, ladies and

gentlemen.  We might be on the verge

of becoming the Atavistics, but we

haven't decided yet.  But tonight,

we are... BARRY JIVE AND THE UPTOWN

FIVE!  ONE TWO THREE --And they launch

into Marvin Gaye's "Got To Give It

Up," almost flawlessly faithful to

the original.  Barry is transformed --

shuffling footwork, a wide smile,

and when the intro winds up, an almost

perfect falsetto.  The crowd goes

nuts, filling the floor.  Rob is

stunned, begins to smile.  Laura

takes his hand and leads him out

into the crowd...
