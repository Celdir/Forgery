FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS

by

Terry Gilliam & Toy Grisoni

Gets rid of the pain

Of being a man."

Dr. Johnson

DUKE (V/O)

We were somewhere around Barstow on

the edge of the desert when the

drugs began to take hold.

DUKE (V/O)

I remember saying something like:

"I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe

you should drive..."

2.

DUKE (V/O)

Suddenly there was a terrible roar

all around us and the sky was full

of what looked like huge bats, all

swooping and screeching and diving

around the car...

DUKE (V/O)

... and a voice was screaming: Holy

Jesus!  What are these goddamn

animals?

GONZO

What are you yelling about?

DUKE

Never mind.  It's your turn to drive.

DUKE (V/O)

No point mentioning these bats.  I

thought.  The poor bastard will see

them soon enough.

DUKE (V/O)

We had two bags of grass, seventy-

five pellets of mescaline, five

sheets of high powered blotter

acid, a salt shaker half full of

cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-

colored uppers, downers, screamers,

laughers... Also a quart of tequila,

a quart of rum, a case of beer, a

pint of raw ether and two dozen

amyls.

3.

DUKE (V/O)

Not that we needed all that for the

trip, but once you get locked into

a serious drug collection, the

tendency is to push it as far as

you can.

DUKE (V/O)

The only thing that really worried

me was the ether.  There is nothing

in the world more helpless and

irresponsible and depraved than a

man in the depths of an ether binge.

And I knew we'd get into that

rotten stuff pretty soon.

RADIO NEWS

An overdose of heroin was listed as

the official cause of death for

pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby

whose body was found stuffed in a

refrigerator last week...

GONZO

"One toke over the line, sweet

Jesus."

4.

DUKE

(muttering to himself)

One toke.  You poor fool.  Wait

till you see those goddamn bats.

GONZO

Let's give that boy a lift.

DUKE

We can't stop here - this is bat

country!

HITCHHIKER

Hot damn!  I never rode in a

convertible before!

DUKE

Is that right?  Well, I guess

you're about ready, eh?

GONZO

We're your friends.  We're not like

the others.

DUKE

(hissing sharply)

No more of that talk or I'll put

the leeches on you.

5.

DUKE (V/O)

How long could we maintain, I

wondered.  How long before one of

us starts raving and jabbering at

this boy?  What will he think then?

This same lonely desert was the

last known home of the Manson family.

DUKE (V/O)

Would he make that grim connection

when my attorney starts screaming

about bats and huge manta rays

coming down on the car?

DUKE (V/O)

If so - well, we'll just have to

cut his head off and bury him

somewhere.  Because it goes without

saying that we can't turn him loose.

He'd report us at once to some kind

of outback Nazi law enforcement

agency, and they'll run us down

like dogs...

DUKE

(out loud to himself)

Jesus!  Did I say that?

DUKE (V/O)

Or just think it?  Was I talking?

Did they hear me?

GONZO

(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)

It's okay.  He's admiring the shape

of your skull.

6.

DUKE (V/O)

Maybe I better have a chat with

this boy I thought.  Perhaps if I

explain things, he'll rest easy...

DUKE

(roaring over the

road noise)

THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD

PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --

DUKE

(yells)

CAN YOU HEAR ME?

DUKE

That's good.  Because I want you to

have all the background.  This is a

very ominous assignment -- with

overtones of extreme personal

danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!

This is important, goddamnit!  This

is a true story!...

(WHACKS the BACK OF

THE DRIVER'S SEAT

with his fist)

GONZO

(screams)

Keep your hands off my fucking neck!

DUKE (V/O)

Our vibrations were getting nasty --

but why?  Was there no communication

in this car?  Had we deteriorated

to the level of dumb beasts?

7.

DUKE

(to HITCHHIKER)

I want you to understand that this

man at the wheel is my attorney!

He's not just some dingbat I found

on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I

think he's probably Samoan.  But it

doesn't matter, does it?  Are you

prejudiced?

HITCHHIKER

Hell, no!

DUKE

I didn't think so.  Because in

spite of his race, this man is

extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I

forgot all about this beer.  You

want one?

(HITCHHIKER shakes

his head)

How about some ether?

HITCHHIKER

What?

DUKE

Never mind.  Let's get right to the

heart of this thing.  Twenty-four

hours ago we were sitting in the

Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills

Hotel...

DUKE (V/O)

... in the patio section, of

course, drinking Singapore Slings

with mescal on the side, hiding

from the brutish realities of this

foul year of Our Lord, 1971.

8.

DUKE

I'm telling you, the Salazar story

is getting too complicated.  The

weasels have started closing in.

DWARF

Perhaps this is the call you've

been waiting for all this time,

sir...

DUKE

Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...

DWARF

That was headquarters.  They want

me to go to Las Vegas at once and

make contact with a Portuguese

photographer named Lacerda.  He'll

have the details.  All I have to do

is check into my sound proof suite

and he'll seek me out.

GONZO

God hell!  I think I see the

pattern!  This one sounds like real

trouble!  You're going to need

plenty of legal advice before this

thing is over.  As your attorney I

must advise you that you'll need a

very fast car with no top and after

that, the cocaine.  And then the

tape recorder, for special music,

and some Acapulco shirts...

(GONZO tucks his

khaki undershirt into

his white

bellbottoms -- he

means business!)

This blows my weekend, because

naturally I'll have to go with

you -- and we'll have to arm

ourselves.

9.

DUKE

Why not?  If a thing's worth doing,

it's worth doing right.

DUKE

I tell you, my man.  This is the

American Dream in action!  We'd be

fools not to ride this strange

torpedo all the way to the end.

GONZO

Indeed.  We must do it.  What kind

of story is this?

DUKE

The Mint 400!  The richest off-road

race for motorcycles and dune-

buggies in the history of organized

sport!

(handing parking

ticket to Valet)

-- a fantastic spectacle in honor

of some fatback grossero who owns

the luxurious Mint Hotel in the

heart of downtown Vegas... at least

that's what the press release says.

DUKE

We're going to have to drum it up

on our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.

DUKE (V/O)

Getting hold of the drugs and

shirts had been no problem...

10.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)

... but the car and tape recorder

were not easy things to round up at

6:30 on a Friday afternoon in

Hollywood.

GONZO

O.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.

We'll be there in thirty minutes.

(to DUKE -- hand over

the PHONE)

I finally located a car with

adequate horsepower and the proper

coloring.

(into PHONE)

What?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has

a major credit card!  Do you

realize who the fuck you're talking

to?

DUKE

Don't take any guff from these

swine.

(GONZO slams the

phone down)

Now we need a sound store with the

finest equipment.  Nothing dinky.

One of those new Belgian Heliowatts

with a voice-activated shotgun

mike, for picking up conversations

in oncoming cars.

GONZO

We won't make the nut unless we

have unlimited credit.

DUKE

We will.  You Samoans are all the

same.  You have no faith in the

essential decency of the white

man's culture.

11.

DUKE (V/O)

The store was closed, but the

salesman said he would wait, if we

hurried...

DUKE (V/O)

But we were delayed en route when a

Stingray in front of us killed a

pedestrain.

DUKE (V/O)

We had trouble, again, at the car

rental agency.

AGENT

Say... uh... you fellas are going

to be careful with this car, aren't

you?

DUKE

Of course.

AGENT

Well, good god!  You just backed

over that two foot concrete abutment

and you didn't even slow down!

Forty-five in reverse!  And you

barely missed the pump!

DUKE

No harm done.  I always test the

transmission that way.  The rear

end.  For stress factors.

12.

AGENT

Say.  Are you fellows drinking?

DUKE

Not me.  We're responsible people.

GONZO

There's another worrier.  He's

probably all cranked up on speed.

DUKE (V/O)

We spent the rest of that night

rounding up materials and packing

the car.  Then we ate some mescaline

and went swimming.

DUKE (V/O)

Our trip was different.  It was to

be a classic affirmation of

everything right and true in the

national character; a gross,

physical salute to the fantastic

possibilities of life in this

country.  But only for those with

true grit...

DUKE

...and we're chock full of that!

13.

GONZO

Damn right!

DUKE

My attorney understands this

concept, despite his racial handicap.

But do you?!

DUKE (V/O)

He said he understood, but I could

see in his eyes that he didn't.  He

was lying to me.

GONZO

My heart!

GONZO (CONT'D)

Where's the medicine?

DUKE

The medicine?  Yes, it's right here.

DUKE

Don't worry, this man has a bad

heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we

have a cure for it.

GONZO

(suddenly flailing

his naked arms at the sky)

Turn up the fucking music!  My

heart feels like an alligator!

Volume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must

have bass!  What's wrong with us?

Are you goddamn old ladies?

DUKE

(turns up music to

full volume)

You scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch

your language!  You're talking to a

Doctor of Journalism!

14.

GONZO

(laughing uncontrollably)

What the fuck are we doing out here?

Somebody call the police!  We need

help!

DUKE

(to HITCHHIKER)

Pay no attention to this swine.  He

can't handle the medicine.

(he begins laughing)

GONZO

(to the HITCHHIKER)

The truth is we're going to Vegas

to croak a scag baron named Savage

Henry.  I've known him for years

but he ripped us off -- and you

know what that means, right?

GONZO (CONT'D)

Savage Henry has cashed his check!

We're going to rip his lungs out!

DUKE

And eat them!  That bastard won't

get away with this!  What's going

on in this country when a scum

sucker like that can get away with

sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

HITCHHIKER

Thanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.

I like you guys.  Don't worry about

me.

DUKE

(yells)

Wait a minute!  Come back and have

a beer!

15.

GONZO

Good riddance.  That boy made me

nervous.  Did you see his eyes?

(laughing)

Jesus, this is good medicine.

DUKE

(suddenly clambering

into the front seat)

Move over!!  We have to get out of

California before that kid finds a

cop!

DUKE (V/O)

It was absolutely imperative that

we get to the Mint Hotel before the

deadline for press registration.

Otherwise, we might have to pay for

our suite.

GONZO

Oh, Jesus!  Did you see what god

just did to us?

DUKE

God didn't do that!  You did it!

You're a fucking narcotics agent,

that was our cocaine, you pig!

GONZO

(waving his .357

Magnum at Duke)

You better be careful.  Plenty of

vultures out here.  They'll pick

your bones clean before morning.

DUKE

You whore!

16.

GONZO

Here -- chew this.  It's your half

of the acid.

DUKE

How long do I have?

GONZO

Maybe thirty more minutes.  As your

attorney, I advise you to drive at

top speed.  It'll be a goddamn

miracle if we can get there before

you turn into a wild animal.  Are

you ready for that?  Checking into

a Vegas hotel under a phony name

with intent to commit capital fraud

and a head full of acid.

DUKE (V/O)

Thirty minutes.  It was going to be

very close.

DUKE

I need this, right?

ATTENDANT

I'll remember your face.

DUKE (V/O)

There is no way of explaining the

terror I felt.

17.

DUKE (V/O)

I was pouring sweat.  My blood is

too thick for Nevada.  I've never

been able to properly explain

myself in this climate.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)

Be quiet, be calm... name, rank,

and press affiliation, nothing

else...

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)

...ignore this terrible drug,

pretend it's not happening...

DUKE

HI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL

DUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S

FOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL

WISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT?

I HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I

REALIZE OF COURSE...

DUKE

... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE

LIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE.

YES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND

YOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S

THE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?

18.

RESERVATIONS CLERK

(hands him an envelope)

Your suite's not ready yet.  But

there's somebody looking for you.

DUKE

(shouts)

NO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING

YET!

GONZO

I can handle this.  This man has a

bad heart, but I have plenty of

medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.

Prepare our suite at once.  We'll

be in the bar.

GONZO

(to the bartender)

Two Cuba Libres with beer and

mescal on the side.

(opens the envelope)

Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us

in a room on the twelfth floor?

DUKE

Lacerda?

DUKE (V/O)

I couldn't remember.  The name rang

a bell, but I couldn't concentrate.

Terrible things were happening all

around us...

19.

DUKE

Order some golf shoes.  Otherwise,

we'll never get out of this place

alive.  It's impossible to walk in

this muck -- no footing at all...

DUKE (V/O)

I was right in the middle of a

fucking reptile zoo.  And somebody

was giving booze to these goddamn

things!  It won't be long before

they tear us to shreds!

GONZO

If you think we're in trouble now

wait until you see what's happening

in the elevators.

GONZO

I just went upstairs to see this

man Lacerda.  I told him I knew

what he was up to...

(GONZO rallies --

turns fierce)

He says he's a photographer!  But

when I mentioned Savage Henry he

freaked!  He knows we're onto him!

DUKE

But what about our room?  And the

golf shoes?

DUKE (CONT'D)

(grabbing GONZO

trying to hold him still)

Holy shit!  Look at that bunch over

there!  They've spotted us!

20.

GONZO

(downs his drink --

gets up)

That's the press table.  Where you

have to sign in for our credentials.

Shit, let's get it over with.  You

handle that, and I'll check on the

room.

DUKE

No, no.  Don't leave me!

BELL BOY

Four club sandwiches, four shrimp

cocktails.

DUKE

There's a big... machine in the

sky... some kind of electric snake...

BELL BOY

... a quart of rum...

DUKE

... coming straight at us.

GONZO

Shoot it.

DUKE

Not yet.  I want to study its habits.

BELL BOY

... and nine fresh grapefruit.

21.

GONZO

Vitamin C.  We'll need all we can

get.

GONZO

Look, you've got to stop this talk

about snakes and leeches and

lizards and that stuff.  It's

making me sick!

DUKE

What are you talking about?

GONZO

You bastard!  They'll never let us

back in that place.  I leave you

alone for three minutes and you

start waving that goddamn marlin

spike around -- yelling about

reptiles!  You scared the shit out

of those people!  They were ready

to call the cops.  Hell, the only

reason they gave us press passes

was to get you out of there...

DUKE

Oh my God!  Who's that?!

LACERDA

Duke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer.

Got your press passes?  Good, good.

Too bad you missed the bikes

checking in.  My, what a sight!

22.

LACERDA

Husquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis.

Maicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs.

Couple of Triumphs, here and there

a CZ.  All very fast.  What a race

it's gonna be.

LACERDA

Well, we start at dawn.  Get a good

night's sleep.  I know I will.

DUKE

(weakly)

That's good...

GONZO

I think he's lying to us.  I could

see it in his eyes.

DUKE

(even weaker)

They'll probably have a big net for

us when we show up.

GONZO

Turn that shit off!

DUKE (V/O)

Never lose sight of the primary

responsibility.  Cover the story.

But what was the story?  Nobody had

bothered to say.

23.

DUKE (V/O)

The racers were ready at dawn.

Very tense.  But the race didn't

start until nine so we had three

long hours to kill.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)

Those of us who had been up all

night were in no mood for coffee

and donuts.  We wanted strong drink.

We were, after all, the Absolute

Cream of the National Sporting

Press and we were gathered here, in

Las Vegas, for a very special

assignment.  And when it comes to

things like this you don't fool

around.

DUKE

See..."Kill the body and the head

will die"... the Frazier/Ali fight...

MAGAZINE REPORTER

A proper end to the 60's... Ali

beaten by a human hamburger!

DUKE

And both Kennedy's murdered by

mutants.

24.

REPORTER

That's it!  They're starting!

REPORTER

Well, that's that.  They'll be back

in an hour or so.  Let's go back to

the bar.

VOICE OFF

Group 2!

VOICE OFF

Group 3!

25.

DUKE (V/O)

There was something like 190 more

bikes waiting to start.  They were

due to go off 10 at a time every 2

minutes.

DUKE

Beer!

HOODLUM

God damn!  What day is this --

Saturday?

DUKE

More like Sunday.

HOODLUM

Hah!  That's a bitch, ain't it?

Last night I was home in Long Beach

and somebody said they were runnin'

the Mint 400 today, so I says to my

old lady, "Man, I'm goin'." So she

gives me a lot of crap about it, so

I start slappin' her around, and

the next thing you know two guys I

never seen before are beating me

stupid.

VOICE OFF

Group 4!

HOODLUM

Then they gave me ten bucks, put me

on a bus, and when I woke up here I

was in downtown Vegas, and for a

minute all I could think was, "O

Jesus, who's divorcing me this

time?" But then I remembered, by

God!  I was here for the Mint 400.

And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful

to be here.  Just wonderful to be

here with you people.

26.

MAGAZINE REPORTER

Senzaman wassyneeds!

DUKE

(smacks the bar with

his palm)

Hell yes!  Bring us ten!

VOICE OFF

Group 5!

MAGAZINE REPORTER

(screams)

I'll back it!

(slides off his stool

to the floor)

MAGAZINE REPORTER (CONT'D)

(on the floor)

This is a magic moment in sport!

It may never come again!  I once

did the Triple Crown, but it was

nothing like this.

FROG-EYED WOMAN

Please stand up!  You're a

correspondent for a major national

magazine who's name we can't get

clearance for!  Please!  You'd be a

very handsome man if you'd just

stand up!

MAGAZINE REPORTER

Listen, madam.  I'm damn near

intolerably handsome down here

where I am.  You'd go crazy if I

stood up!

LACERDA

Club soda, please.

FROG-EYED WOMAN

(to MAGAZINE REPORTER)

Please!  I love Life!

27.

LACERDA

(to DUKE)

Man, it's great out there!

DUKE

Lunatics.

VOICE OFF

Group 6!

LACERDA

Meet you outside!

DUKE (V/O)

By 10 they were spread out all over

the course.  It was no longer a

race, now it was an Endurance

Contest.  The idea of trying to

"cover this race" in any

conventional press sense was absurd.

LACERDA

It's great, isn't it?!  Jump in!

28.

LACERDA

I'll just keep trying different

combos of film and lenses till I

find one that works in this dust!

BATTLE HYMN

"...As we go marching on

When I reach my final campground,

in

that land beyond the sun,

And the Great Commander asks me..."

[What did he ask you, Rusty?]

"Did you fight or did you run?"

BATTLE HYMN

(continuing)

[And what did you tell them,

Rusty?]

"We responded to their rifle fire

with everything we had..."

DUNE BUGGY DRIVER

Where's the damn race?

DUKE

Beats me.  We're just good patriotic

Americans like yourself.

DUNE BUGGY DRIVER

(suspiciously)

What outfit you fellas with?

29.

DUKE

The sporting press.  We're

friendlies.  Hired geeks.

DUKE

If you want a good chase, you

should get after that skunk from

CBS News up ahead in the black jeep.

He's the man responsible for that

book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.

DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1

HOT DAMN!

DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2

A black jeep, you say?

DUKE

Take me back to the pits.

LACERDA

No, no -- we have to go on.  We

need total coverage.

DUKE

You're fired.

DUKE (V/O)

It was time.  I felt, for an

Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole

scene.  The race was definitely

under way.  I had witnessed the

start; I was sure of that much.

But what now?

30.

DUKE

Turn up the radio!  Turn up the

tape machine!  Roll the windows

down.  Let's taste this cool desert

wind!  Aaah, yes!  This is what

it's all about!

DUKE (V/O)

Total control now.  Tooling along

the main drag on a Saturday night

in Vegas, two good old boys in a

fire apple red convertible...

stoned, ripped, twisted... Good

people!

GONZO

How about "Nickel Nick's Slot

Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds

heavy.  Twenty-nine cent hotdogs...

DUKE

Look, what are we doing here?  Are

we here to entertain ourselves, or

to do the job?

GONZO

To do the job, of course.  Here we

go... a Crab Louie and quart of

muscatel for twenty dollars!

GONZO

As your attorney I advise you to

drive over to the Tropicana and

pick up on Guy Lombardo.  He's in

the Blue Room with his Royal

Canadians.

DUKE

Why?

GONZO

Why what?

31.

DUKE

Why should I pay out my hard-earned

dollars to watch a fucking corpse.

I don't know about you, but in my

line of business it's important to

be Hep.

DOORMAN #1

What the hell are you doing?!

DOORMAN #2

You can't park here!

DUKE

Why not?  Is this not a reasonable

place to park?

GONZO

We want this car parked!  We drove

all the way from L.A. for this show.

We're friends of Debbie's.

DUKE

Holy shit!  They almost had us

there!  That was quick thinking.

GONZO

What do you expect?  I'm your

attorney.  You owe me five bucks.

I want it now.

32.

DUKE (V/O)

This was Bob Hope's turf.  Frank

Sinatra's.  Spiro Agnew's.  It

seemed inappropriate to be haggling

about nickel/dime bribes for the

parking lot attendant.

WINE-COLORED TUXEDO

Sorry, full house.

GONZO

Goddamnit, we drove all the way

from L.A.

WINE-COLORED TUXEDO

I said there are no seats left...

at any price.

GONZO

Fuck seats!  We're old friends of

Debbie's.  I used to romp with her.

DUKE (V/O)

After a lot of bad noise, he let us

in for nothing provided we would

stand quietly at the back and not

smoke.

GONZO

Jesus creeping shit!

DUKE

(tears streaming)

Did the mescaline just kick in?  Or

was that Debbie Reynolds in a

silver Afro wig?!

33.

GONZO

(in hysteria)

We wandered into a fucking time

capsule!

DUKE

(in hysteria)

We wandered into a fucking time

capsule!

GONZO

What's this?...

GONZO

That scum...

GONZO

SCUM!  I know where you live!  I'll

find you and burn down your fucking

house!

DUKE

This is the place.  They'll never

fuck with us here.

GONZO

Where's the ether?  This mescaline

isn't working.

34.

DUKE (V/O)

Ah, devil ether.  It makes you

behave like the village drunkard in

some early Irish novel... total

loss of all basic motor skills;

blurred vision, no balance, numb

tongue --

(throws away kleenex)

The mind recoils in horror, unable

to communicate with the spinal

column.  Which is interesting,

because you can actually watch

yourself behaving in this terrible

way, but you can't control it.

DUKE (V/O)

You approach the turnstiles and

know that when you get there, you

have to give the man two dollars or

he won't let you inside... but when

you get there, everything goes wrong.

DUKE (V/O)

Some angry Rotarian shoves you and

you think: What's happening here?

What's going on?  Then you hear

yourself mumbling.

DUKE

(mumbling)

Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of

mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My

name is Brinks; I was born... Born?

GONZO

Get sheep over side... women and

children to armored car... orders

from Captain Zeep.

35.

DUKE (V/O)

Ether is the perfect drug for Las

Vegas.  In this town they love a

drunk.  Fresh meat.  So they put us

through the turnstiles and turned

us loose inside.

DUKE (V/O)

Bazooko Circus is what the whole

hep world would be doing Saturday

night if the Nazis had won the war.

This was the Sixth Reich.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)

A drug person can learn to cope

with things like seeing their dead

grandmother crawling up their leg

with a knife in her teeth but,

nobody should be asked to handle

this trip.

FAIRGROUND BARKER

Stand in front of this fantastic

machine, my friend.  For just 99

cents your likeness will appear 200

hundred feet tall on a screen above

downtown Las Vegas.

36.

FAIRGROUND BARKER

99 cents more for a voice message.

Say whatever you want, fella.

They'll hear you, don't worry about

that.  Remember, you'll be 200 feet

tall!

ANOTHER BARKER

Step right up!  Shoot the pasties

off the nipples of this ten-foot

bull-dyke and win a cotton candy

goat!

GONZO

I hate to say this, but this place

is getting to me.  I think I'm

getting The Fear.

DUKE

Nonsense.  We came here to find the

American Dream, and now we're right

in the vortex you want to quit.

You must realize that we've found

the Main Nerve.

GONZO

That's what gives me The Fear.

DUKE

Look over there.  Two women fucking

a Polar Bear.

GONZO

Please, don't tell me those things...

Not now.

(signals the waitress

for two Wild Turkeys)

This is my last drink.  How much

money can you lend me?

DUKE

Not much.  Why?

GONZO

I have to go.

DUKE

GO?

37.

GONZO

Yes.  Leave the country.  Tonight.

DUKE

Calm down.  You'll be straight in a

few hours.

GONZO

No.  This is serious.  One more

hour in this town and I'll kill

somebody!

DUKE

OK.  I'll lend you some money.

Let's go outside and see how much

we have left.

GONZO

Can we make it?

DUKE

That depends on how many people we

fuck with between here and the door.

GONZO

I want to leave fast.

DUKE

OK.  Lets pay this bill and get up

very slowly.  It's going to be a

long walk.

(signals waitress who

comes over)

GONZO

(suddenly to waitress)

Do they pay you to screw that bear?

WAITRESS

What?

DUKE

He's just kidding.

(to GONZO)

Come on, Doc -- lets go downstairs

and gamble.

GONZO

When does this thing stop?

38.

DUKE

It won't stop.  It's not ever going

to stop.

DUKE

Don't move you'll come around.

DUKE

You fell.  Let's go.

DUKE (CONT'D)

OK.  You stay here and go to jail.

I'm leaving.

GONZO

Did you see that?  Some sonofabitch

kicked me in the back.

DUKE

Probably the bartender.  He wanted

to stomp you for what you said to

the waitress.

GONZO

Good God!  Let's get out of here!

Where's the elevator?

DUKE

(turning him in the

opposite direction)

Don't go near that elevator.

That's just what they want us to

do... trap us in a steel box and

take us down to the basement.

39.

DUKE

Don't run.  They'd like any excuse

to shoot us.

GONZO

(in an extended fall)

You drive!  I think there's

something wrong with me.

GONZO

Those bastards have changed the

lock on us.  They probably searched

the room.  Jesus, we're finished!

GONZO

Bolt everything!  Use all chains!

GONZO

Where did this one come from?

DUKE

That's Lacerda's room.

GONZO

Yeah... I thought we might need it...

DUKE

What for?

40.

GONZO

Let's go up there and blast him out

of bed with the fire hose.

DUKE

No, we should leave the poor

bastard alone.  I get the feeling

that he's avoiding us for some

reason.

GONZO

Don't kid yourself.  That Portuguese

son of a bitch is dangerous.  He's

watching us like a hawk.

DUKE

He told me he was turning in early...

GONZO

That dirty bastard!  I knew it!

He's got hold of my woman!

DUKE

(laughing)

That little blonde groupie with the

film crew?  You think he sodomized

her?

GONZO

That's right, laugh about it!  You

goddamn honkies are all the same!

DUKE

Where'd you get that knife?

GONZO

Room service sent it up.  I wanted

something to cut the limes.

DUKE

What limes?

41.

GONZO

They didn't have any.  They don't

grow in the desert.

GONZO

That dirty toad bastard!  I knew I

should have taken him out when I

had the chance.  Now he has her.

DUKE (V/O)

I remember the girl.  We'd had a

problem with her in the elevator a

few hours earlier: my attention had

made a fool of himself.

BLONDE TV REPORTER

(to Gonzo)

You must be a rider.  What class

are you in?

GONZO

Class?  What the fuck do you mean?

BLONDE TV REPORTER

What do you ride?  We're filming

the race for a TV series -- maybe

we can use you.

GONZO

Use me?

DUKE (V/O)

Mother of God, I thought.  Here it

comes.

42.

GONZO

(suddenly shouting)

I ride the BIG ONES!  The really

BIG fuckers!

DUKE

The Vincent Black Shadow.  We're

with the Factory Team.

TV CAMERAMAN

Bullshit.

GONZO

Wait a minute, pardon me lady, but

I think there's some kind of

ignorant chicken-sucker in this car

who needs his face cut open.  You

cheap honky faggots!  Which one of

you wants to get cut?!

GONZO

Spooked!  They were spooked!  Like

rats in a death cage!

GONZO

Goddamn.  It's serious now.  That

girl understood.  She fell in love

with me.

43.

GONZO

Let's go up there and castrate that

fucker!

GONZO

(squinting suspiciously)

Have you made a deal with him?  Did

you put him on to her?

DUKE

(backing slowly

towards the door)

Look you better put that blade away

and get your head straight.  I have

to put the car in the lot.

DUKE (V/O)

One of the things you learn, after

years of dealing with drug people,

is that you can turn your back on a

person, but never turn your back on

a drug.  Especially when it's

waving a razor-sharp hunting knife

in your eyes.

MAGAZINE REPORTER

Las Vegas at dawn.  The racers are

still asleep, the dust is still on

the desert, fifty thousand dollars

in prize money, slumbers darkly in

the office safe at Del Webb's

fabulous Mint Hotel...

DUKE (V/O)

Who are these people?  These faces!

Where do they come from?  They look

like caricatures of used car

dealers from Dallas.

(MORE)

44.

DUKE (V/O; CONT'D)

And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell

of a lot of them at four-thirty on

a Monday morning.  Still humping

the American dream, that vision of

the big winner somehow emerging

from the last minute predawn chaos

of a stale Vegas casino.

DUKE

You bastards!

DUKE (V/O)

No.  Calm down.  Learn to ENJOY

losing.

DUKE

You ate ALL THIS ACID?

DUKE

(turning down the volume)

You evil son of a bitch.  You

better hope there's some Thorazine

in that bag, because if there's

not, you're in bad trouble.

GONZO

Music!  Turn it up.  Put that tape

on.

45.

DUKE

What tape?

GONZO

Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit."

I want a rising sound.

DUKE

You're doomed.  I'm leaving here in

two hours and then they're going to

come up here and beat the mortal

shit out of you with big saps.

Right there in that tub.

GONZO

I dig my own graves.  Green water

and the White Rabbit.  Put it on.

DUKE

OK.  But do me one last favor, will

you.  Can you give me two hours?

That's all I ask -- just two hours

to sleep before tomorrow.  I

suspect it's going to be a very

difficult day.

GONZO

(coolly)

Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll

give you all the time you need, at

my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but

you'll be wanting a cushion, so,

why don't you just lay one of those

$100 bills down there beside the

radio, and fuck off?

DUKE

How about a check?

GONZO

Whatever's right.

GONZO (V/O)

Help!  You bastard!  I need help!

46.

DUKE

Shit, he's killing himself!

GONZO

(snarling)

I want that fucking radio!

DUKE

Don't touch it!  Get back in that

tub!

GONZO

Back the tape up.  I need it again!

Let it roll!  Just as high as the

fucker can go!  And when it comes

to that fantastic note where the

rabbit bites its own head off, I

want you to THROW THAT FUCKING

RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!

DUKE

Not me.  It would blast you through

the wall -- stone dead in ten

seconds and they'd make me explain

it!

GONZO

BULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.

DUKE

Jesus.

GONZO

Do it!  I want to get HIGHER!

47.

DUKE

Okay.  You're right.  This is

probably the only solution.

(holds the PLUGGED IN

TAPE/RADIO over the tub)

Let me make sure I have it all

lined up.  You want me to throw

this thing into the tub when "WHITE

RABBIT" peaks.  Is that it?

GONZO

Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think

I was going to have to go out and

get one of the goddamn maids to do

it.

DUKE

Are you ready?

DUKE

MACE!  YOU WANT THIS?

GONZO

You bastard!  You'd do that,

wouldn't you?

48.

DUKE

(laughs)

Why worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing

in the world like a Mace high.

Forty-five minutes on your knees

with the dry heaves...

GONZO

You cheap honky sonofabitch...

DUKE

Why not?  Hell, just a minute ago,

you were asking me to kill you!

And now you want to kill me!  What

I should do, goddamnit, is call the

police!

GONZO

The cops?

DUKE

There's no choice.  I wouldn't dare

go to sleep with you wandering

around with a head full of acid and

wanting to slice me up with that

goddamn knife!

GONZO

(mumbles)

Who said anything about slicing you

up?  I just wanted to carve a

little Z on your forehead.  Nothing

serious.

DUKE

(menaces him with the MACE)

Get back in that tub.  Eat some

reds and try to calm down.  Smoke

some grass, shoot some smack --

shit, do whatever you have to do,

but let me get some rest.

GONZO

Hell, yes.  You really need some

sleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.

What a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't

let me keep you up.

49.

DUKE (V/O)

Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom.

Just another ugly refugee from the

Love Generation.

DUKE (V/O)

My attorney had never been able to

accept the notion -- often espoused

by former drug abusers -- that you

can get a lot higher without drugs

than with them.  And neither have

I, for that matter.

DUKE (V/O)

I recall one night in the Matrix.

There I was -- a victim of the Drug

Explosion.  A natural street freak,

just eating whatever came by.

ROAD-PERSON

Anybody want some L...S...D...?  I

got all the makin's right here.

All I need is a place to cook.

50.

DUKE (V/O)

I decided to eat only half at first.

Good thinking.  But I spilled the

rest on the sleeve of my red

Pendleton shirt.

MUSICIAN

What's the trouble?

DUKE

(also in slow-motion)

Well, all this white stuff on my

sleeve is LSD.

DUKE (V/O)

With a bit of luck his life was

ruined -- forever thinking that

just behind some narrow door in all

his favorite bars, men in red

Pendleton shirts are getting

incredible kicks from things he'll

never know.

51.

DUKE (V/O)

Strange memories on this nervous

night in Las Vegas.

(he gets up, pours

himself a drink)

Has it been five years?  Six?  It

seems like a lifetime -- the kind

of peak that never comes again.

San Francisco in the middle sixties

was a very special time and place

to be a part of.  But no

explanation, no mix of words or

music or memories can touch that

sense of knowing that you were

there and alive in that corner of

time and the world.  Whatever it

meant.

DUKE (V/O)

THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,

AT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE

SPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A

FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT

WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,

THAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I

THINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE

OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE

FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY

MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T

NEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY

prevail.  We had all the momentum;

we were riding the crest of a high

and beautiful wave...

DUKE (V/O)

So now, less than five years later,

you can go up on a steep hill in

Las Vegas and look west, and with

the right kind of eyes you can

almost see the high water mark --

that place where the wave finally

broke and rolled back.

52.

DUKE (V/O)

The decision to flee came suddenly.

Or maybe not.

BELL BOY

Room service!

DUKE (V/O)

Maybe I'd planned it all along --

subconsciously waiting for the

right moment.  The bill was a

factor, I think.  Because I had no

money to pay for it.

DUKE (V/O)

Our room service tabs had been

running somewhere between $29 and

$36 per hour, for forty-eight

consecutive hours.  Incredible.

How could it happen?

DUKE (V/O)

But by the time I asked this

question, there was no one around

to answer.

53.

DUKE (V/O)

My attorney was gone.  He must have

sensed trouble.

QUICK CUT TO:

DUKE (V/O)

Panic.

DUKE (V/O)

It crept up my spine like first

rising vibes of an acid frenzy.

All these horrible realities began

to dawn on me.

DUKE (V/O)

Here I was, alone in Las Vegas,

with this goddamned incredibly

expensive car, completely twisted

on drugs, no cash, no story for the

magazine.  And on top of everything

else I had a gigantic goddamn hotel

bill to deal with.

DUKE (V/O)

I didn't even know who had won the

race.  Maybe nobody.

54.

DUKE

(muttering to himself)

How would Horatio Alger have

handled this situation?

DUKE (V/O)

Stay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a

relatively respectable citizen -- a

multiple felon, perhaps, but

certainly not dangerous.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)

Luckily, I had taken the soap and

grapefruit and other luggage out to

the car a few hours earlier.  Now

it was only a matter of slipping

the noose...

CLERK'S VOICE

MR. DUKE!

CLERK'S VOICE

Mr. Duke!  We've been looking for

you!

DUKE (V/O)

The game was up!  They had me.

DUKE

(to himself)

Well, why not?  Many fine books

have been written in prison.

55.

CLERK

Sir?

(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)

This telegram came for you.

Actually, it isn't for you.  It's

for somebody named Thompson, but it

says 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does

that make sense?

DUKE

(barely able to speak)

Yes... It makes sense.

CLERK

I checked the register for this man

Thompson.  We don't show him but I

figured he might be part of your

team.

DUKE

He is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to

him.

CLERK

What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's

signature on the telegram from Los

Angeles.  When we knew he was right

here in the hotel.

DUKE

You did the right thing.  Never try

to understand a press message.

About half the time we use codes --

especially with Dr. Gonzo.

CLERK

Tell me.  When will the doctor be

awake?

56.

DUKE

(tenses)

Awake?  What do you mean?

CLERK

(uncomfortably)

Well... the manager, Mr. Heem,

would like to meet him.  Nothing

unusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet

all our large accounts... put them

on a personal basis... just a chat

and a handshake, you understand.

DUKE

Of course.  But if I were you, I'd

leave the Doctor alone until after

he's eaten breakfast.  He's a very

crude man.

CLERK

But he will be available?  Perhaps

later this morning?

DUKE

Look.  That telegram was all

scrambled.  It was actually from

Thompson, not to him.  Western

Union must have gotten the names

reversed.  I have to get going.  I

have to get out to the track.

CLERK

There's no hurry!  The race is over!

DUKE

(taking off)

Not for me.

CLERK

Let's have lunch!

DUKE

Righto!

57.

DUKE (V/O)

Jesus, bad waves of paranoia,

madness, fear and loathing --

intolerable vibrations in this

place.  Get out!  The weasels were

closing in.  I could smell the ugly

brutes.  Flee!

DUKE

Do me one last favor Lord: just

give me five more high-speed hours

before you bring the hammer down;

just let me get rid of this goddamn

car and off of this horrible desert.

DUKE (CONT'D)

You evil bastard!  This is your

work!  You'd better take care of

me, Lord... because if you don't

you're going to have me on your

hands.

DUKE (V/O)

Few people understand the psychology

of dealing with a Highway Traffic

Cop.  Your normal speeder will

panic and immediately pull over to

the side.  This is wrong.

DUKE (V/O)

It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

58.

DUKE (V/O)

Make the bastard chase you.  He

will follow.  But he won't know

what to make of your blinker signal

that says you're about to turn right.

DUKE (V/O)

This is to let him know you're

looking for a proper place to pull

off and talk.

DUKE (V/O)

It will take him a moment to

realize that he is about to make

180 degree turn at speed... but you

will be ready for it, braced for

the G's and the fast heel toe work.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

Just what the FUCK did you think

you were doing?!

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

May I see your license.

DUKE

Of course, officer.

DUKE (V/O)

I knew I was fucked.

59.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

Could I have that, please?

DUKE

Why not?  It was getting warm anyway.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

You realize...

DUKE

Yeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I

understand that.  I knew it was a

crime but I did it anyway.  Shit,

why argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

That's a strange attitude.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

You know -- I get the feeling you

could use a nap.  There's a rest

area up ahead.  Why don't you pull

over and sleep a few hours?

DUKE

A nap won't help.  I've been awake

for too long -- three or four

nights.  I can't even remember.  If

I go to sleep now, I'm dead for

twenty hours.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes

into my book, as of noon, is that I

apprehended you... for driving too

fast, and advised you to proceed no

further than the next rest area...

your stated destination, right?

Where you plan to take a long nap.

Do I make myself clear?

DUKE

How far is Baker?  I was hoping to

stop there for lunch.

60.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

Not my jurisdiction.  The city

limits are two point two miles

beyond the rest area.  Can you make

it that far?

DUKE

I'll try.  I've been wanting to go

to Baker for a long time.  I've

heard a lot about it.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

Excellent seafood.  With a mind

like yours, you'll probably want to

try the land-crab.  Try the Majestic

Diner.

DUKE (V/O)

I felt raped.  The Pig had done me

on all fronts, and now he was going

off to chuckle about it -- on the

west side of town, waiting for me

to make a run for L.A.

DUKE

Great Jesus, it's him.

DUKE

They've nailed me!  I'm trapped in

some stinking desert crossroads

called Baker.  I don't have much

time.  The fuckers are closing in.

They'll hunt me down like a beast!

61.

GONZO

Who?  You sound a little paranoid.

DUKE

You bastard!  I need a lawyer

immediately!

GONZO

What are you doing in Baker?

Didn't you get my telegram?

DUKE

What?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in

trouble.  You worthless bastard.

I'll cripple your ass for this!

All that shit in the car is yours!

You understand that?  When I finish

testifying out here you'll be

disbarred!

GONZO

You're supposed to be in Vegas.  We

have a suite at the Flamingo.  I

was just about to leave for the

airport.

GONZO'S VOICE

You brainless scumbag!  You're

supposed to be covering the National

District Attorney's conference!  I

made all the reservations... rented

a white Cadillac convertible... the

whole thing is arranged!  What the

hell are you doing out there in the

middle of the fucking desert?

62.

DUKE

Never mind.  It's all a big joke.

I'm actually sitting beside the

pool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking

from a portable phone.  Some dwarf

brought it out from the casino.  I

have total credit!  Can you grasp

that?

(shouts)

Don't come anywhere near this place!

Foreigners aren't welcome here!

DUKE (V/O)

Well.  This is how the world works.

DUKE (V/O)

All energy flows according to the

whims of the Great Magnet.

DUKE (V/O)

What a fool I was to defy Him.

DUKE (V/O)

Never cross the Great Magnet.  I

understood this now...

(another blast from

the gun)

... and with understanding came a

sense of almost terminal relief.

63.

DUKE (V/O)

I had to get rid of The Shark.  Too

many people might recognize it...

...especially the Vegas Police.

(tight C/U of DUKE)

Luckily, my credit card was still

technically valid.

DUKE (V/O)

This was a superior machine -- ten

grand worth of gimmicks and high

price special effects.  The rear

windows leapt up with a touch like

frogs in a dynamited pond.  The

dashboard was full of esoteric

lights and dials and meters that I

would never understand.

DUKE (V/O)

If the Pigs were gathering in

Vegas, I felt the Drug Culture

should be represented as well...

and there was a certain bent appeal

in the notion of running a savage

burn on one Las Vegas hotel and

then just wheeling across town and

checking into another.

DUKE (V/O)

Me and a thousand ranking cops from

all over America.  Why not?  Move

confidently into their midst.

64.

DUKE (V/O)

My arrival was badly timed.

POLICE CHIEF

What do you mean I'm too late to

register?  I'm a police chief.

From Michigan.  Look, fella, I told

you.

(waves a POSTCARD)

I have a postcard here that says I

have reservations in this hotel.

CLERK

(prissily)

I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the

"late list." Your reservations were

transferred to the... ah...

Moonlight Motel, which is out on

Paradise Boulevard...

POLICE CHIEF

I've already paid for my goddamn

room!

CLERK

It's actually a very fine place of

lodging and only sixteen blocks

from here, with its own pool and...

POLICE CHIEF

You dirty little faggot!  Call the

manager!  I'm tired of listening to

this dogshit!

CLERK

(solicitously)

I'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you

a cab?

DUKE (V/O)

Of course, I could hear what the

Clerk was really saying...

65.

CLERK

(IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)

Listen, you fuzzy little shithead --

I've been fucked around, in my

time, by a fairly good cross-

section of mean-tempered rule-crazy

cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck

you, officer, I'm in charge here,

and I'm telling you we don't have

room for you."

DUKE

Say.  I hate to interrupt, but I

wonder if maybe I could just sort

of slide through and get out of

your way.  Name's Raoul Duke --

Raoul Duke.  My attorney made the

reservation.

CLERK

Certainly, Mr. Duke!

DUKE

My bags are out there in that white

Cadillac convertible.  Can you have

someone drive it around to the room?

DUKE

Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild

Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and

a night's worth of ice delivered to

my room, please?

CLERK

Don't worry about a thing, sir.

Just enjoy your stay.

DUKE

Well, thank you.

66.

DUKE

Ah, home at last!

DUKE

You degenerate pig!

GONZO

It can't be helped.  This is Lucy.

(laughing distractedly)

You know--like "Lucy In The Sky

With Diamonds."

GONZO

Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!

Remember what happened at the

airport!  No more of that, okay?

GONZO

Lucy... this is my client.  This is

Mr. Duke, the famous journalist.

He's paying for this suite, Lucy.

He's on our side.

GONZO

Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves

artists.

GONZO

Lucy paints portraits of Barbra

Streisand.

67.

LUCY

I drew these from TV.

GONZO

Fantastic.  She came all the way

down here from Montana just to give

these portraits to Barbra.  We're

going over to the Americana Hotel

tonight to meet her backstage...

DUKE (V/O)

I desperately needed peace, rest,

sanctuary.  I hadn't counted on

this.  Finding my attorney on acid

and locked into some kind of

preternatural courtship.

DUKE

Well, I guess they brought the car

round by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF

OUT OF THE TRUNK.

GONZO

Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.

(to LUCY)

Now, we'll be right back.  Don't

answer the phone if it rings.

LUCY

(makes one-fingered

Jesus freak sign)

God bless.

DUKE

WELL?  What are your plans?

GONZO

Plans?

DUKE

Lucy.

68.

GONZO

(struggling to focus)

Shit.  I met her on the plane and I

had all that acid.

(he shrugs)

You know, those little blue barrels.

I gave her a cap before I realized...

she's a religious freak... Jesus,

she's never even had a drink.

DUKE

Well... It'll probably work out.

We can keep her loaded and peddle

her ass at the drug convention.

GONZO

Listen, she's running away from

home for something like the fifth

time in six months.  It's terrible.

DUKE

She's perfect for this gig.  These

cops will go fifty bucks a head to

beat her into submission and then

gang fuck her.  We can set her up

in one of these back street motels,

hang pictures of Jesus all over the

room, then turn these pigs loose on

her... Hell she's strong; she'll

hold her own.

GONZO

Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick

but I never expected to hear you

actually say that kind of stuff.

DUKE

It's straight economics.  This girl

is a god-send.  Shit, she can make

us a grand a day.

GONZO

NO!  Stop talking like that.

DUKE

I figure she can do about four at a

time.  Christ, if we keep her full

of acid that's more like two grand

a day.  Maybe three.

69.

GONZO

You filthy bastard.  I should cave

your fucking head in.

DUKE

In a few hours, she'll probably be

sane enough to work herself into a

towering Jesus-based rage at the

hazy recollection of being seduced

by some kind of cruel Samoan who

fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her

to a Vegas hotel room and savagely

penetrated every orifice in her

body with his throbbing,

uncircumcised member.

GONZO

NO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I

wanted to help her!

DUKE

You'll go straight to the gas

chamber.  And even if you manage to

beat that, they'll send you back to

Nevada for Rape and Consensual

Sodomy.  She's got to go.

GONZO

Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help

somebody these days.

DUKE (V/O)

The only alternative was to take

her out to the desert and feed her

remains to the lizards.  But, it

seemed a bit heavy for the thing we

were trying to protect: My attorney.

GONZO

We have to cut her loose.  She's

got two hundred dollars.  And we

can always call the cops up there

in Montana, where she lives, and

turn her in.

DUKE

What?... What kind of goddamn

monster are you?

70.

GONZO

It just occurred to me, that she

has no witnesses.  Anything that

she says about us is completely

worthless.

DUKE

Us?

DUKE

Hotel Americana?  I need a

reservation.  For my niece.  Listen,

I need her treated very gently.

She's an artist, and might seem a

trifle highstrung...

GONZO

Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet

Barbra...

DUKE (V/O)

I felt like a Nazi, but it had to

be done.

DUKE (V/O)

Lucy was a potentially fatal

millstone on both our necks.  There

was absolutely no choice but to cut

her adrift and hope her memory was

fucked.

GONZO

Well that's that.  Take off slowly.

Don't attract attention.

71.

GONZO

I gave the cabbie an extra ten

bucks to make sure she gets there

safe.  Also, I told him I'd be

there myself in an hour, and if she

wasn't, I'd come back out here and

rip his lungs out.

DUKE

That's good.  You can't be subtle

in this town.

GONZO

As your attorney, I advise you to

tell me where you put the goddamn

mescaline.

DUKE

Maybe we should take it easy tonight.

GONZO

Right.  Let's find a good seafood

restaurant and eat some red salmon.

I feel a powerful lust for red

salmon...

DUKE

Come on, we're going to be late.

GONZO

This goddamn mescaline.  Why the

fuck can't they make it a little

less pure?  Maybe mix it up with

Rolaids or something.

72.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

(crackling and

booming over the

lousy sound system)

On behalf of the prosecuting

attorneys of this county, I welcome

you to the Third National DA's

Conference on Narcotics and

Dangerous Drugs.

GONZO

(lowers his voice)

I saw these bastards in Easy Rider,

but I didn't believe they were real.

Not like this.  Not hundreds of them!

DUKE

They're actually nice people when

you get to know them.

GONZO

Man, I know these people in my

goddamn blood!

DUKE

Don't mention that word around here.

You'll get them excited.

GONZO

This is a fucking nightmare.

73.

DUKE

Right.  Sure as hell some dope-

dealing bomb freak is going to

recognize you and put the word out

that you're partying with a thousand

cops.

COP IN BACK

SSSSHHH!

DR. BLUMQUIST

We must come to terms with the Drug

Culture in the country... country...

country...

DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)

The reefer butt is called a "roach,"

because it resembles a cockroach...

cockroach... cockroach...

GONZO

(whispers)

What the fuck are these people

talking about?  You'd have to be

crazy on acid to think a joint

looked like a goddamn cockroach!

DUKE (V/O)

It was clear that we had stumbled

into a prehistoric gathering.

DR. BLUMQUIST

Now, there are four states of being

in the cannabis, or marijuana,

society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and

Square.  The square is seldom if

ever cool.  He is not "with it,"

that is, he doesn't know "what's

happening." But if he manages to

figure it out, he moves up a notch

to "hip."

DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)

And if he can bring himself to

approve of what is happening, he

becomes "groovy." After that, with

much luck and perseverance, he can

rise to the rank of "cool." A cool

guy... cool guy... cool guy...

74.

COP IN BACK

Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the

anthropologist, Margaret Mead's

strange behavior of late might

possibly be explained by a private

marijuana addiction?

DR. BLUMQUIST

I really don't know, but at her

age, if she did smoke grass, she'd

have one hell of a trip!

GONZO

I know a hell of a lot better ways

to waste my time than listening to

this bullshit.

COP IN BACK

Down in front!

GONZO

Fuck you!  I have to get out!  I

don't belong here!

COP IN BACK

Good riddance!

FILM NARRATOR

KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE

MAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be

able to see his eyes because of

Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will

be white from inner tension...

FILM NARRATOR

... and his pants will be crusted

with semen from constantly jacking

off when he can't find a rape

victim...

75.

DUKE

Pardon me, I feel sick.

FILM NARRATOR

He will stagger and babble when

questioned.  He will not respect

your badge.  The Dope Fiend fears

nothing.  He will attack, for no

reason, with every weapon at his

command -- including yours...

DUKE

Sorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling

sick...

FILM NARRATOR

BEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a

suspected marijuana addict should

use all necessary force immediately.

One stitch in time [on him] will

usually save nine on you.

DA

I'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't

have much trouble from drugs where

I come from...

GONZO

You will.  One of these nights

you'll wake up and find a junkie

tearing your bedroom apart.

DA

Naw!

GONZO

They'll climb right into your

bedroom and sit on your chest with

big Bowie knives.  They might even

sit on your wife's chest.  Put the

blade right down on her throat.

76.

DA

Not down in my parts.

DUKE

(to WAITRESS)

Rum and ice, please.

DA

(looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)

You're another one of these

California boys.  Your friend

here's been tellin' us about dope

fiends.

DUKE

They're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.

And sure as hell not in the South.

They like warm weather... You'd

never believe it.  In L.A. it's out

of control.  First it was drugs,

now it's witchcraft.

DA

Witchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!

GONZO

Read the newspapers.

DUKE

Man, you don't know trouble until

you have to face down a bunch of

these addicts gone crazy for human

sacrifice!

DA

Naw!  That's science fiction stuff!

DUKE

Not where we operate.

GONZO

Hell, in Malibu alone, these

goddamn Satan worshippers kill six

or eight people every day.  All

they want is the blood.  They'll

take people right off the street if

they have to.

77.

DUKE

Just the other day we had a case

where they grabbed a girl right out

of a McDonald's hamburger stand.

She was a waitress, about sixteen

years old... with a lot of people

watching, too!

DA

What happened?  What did they do to

her?

GONZO

Do?  Jesus Christ, man.  They

chopped her goddamn head off right

there in the parking lot!  Then

they cut all kinds of holes in her

head and sucked out the blood!

DA

(DA ad-libs a

summation of the crime)

And nobody did anything?

DUKE

What could they do?  The guy that

took the head was about six-seven,

and maybe three-hundred pounds.  He

was packing two Lugers, and the

others had M-16s.

GONZO

They just ran back out into Death

Valley -- you know, where Manson

turned up...

DUKE

Like big lizards.

GONZO

... and every one of them stacked

naked...

DA

Naked!?

DUKE

Naked.

78.

GONZO

Yeh, naked!... except for the

weapons.

DUKE

They were all veterans.

DA

Veterans?!!!?

GONZO

Yeh.  The big guy used to be a

major in the Marines.

DA

A major!

GONZO

We know where he lives, but we

can't get near the house.

DA

Naw!  Not a major.

GONZO

He wanted the pineal gland.

DA

Really?

GONZO

That's how he got so big.  When he

quit the Marines he was just a

little guy.

DUKE

Usually, it's whole families.

During the night.  Most of them

don't even wake up until they feel

their heads going -- and then, of

course, it's too late.

DUKE (CONT'D)

Happens every day.

79.

DUKE (CONT'D)

Three more rums.  Plenty of ice.

Maybe a handful of lime chunks.

WAITRESS

Are you guys with the police

convention upstairs?

DA

We sure are, Miss.

WAITRESS

I thought so.  I never heard that

kind of talk around here before.

Jesus Christ!  How do you guys

stand that kind of work?

GONZO

(grinning)

We like it.  It's groovy.

DUKE

What's wrong with you?  Hell,

somebody has to do it.

GONZO

Hurry up with those drinks.  We're

thirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine

a Bloody Mary.

DA

(whacks his fist on

the bar)

Hell, I really hate to hear this.

Because everything that happens in

California seems to get down our

way, sooner or later.  Mostly

Atlanta.  But that was back when

the goddamn bastards were peaceful.

All we had to do was to keep 'em

under surveillance.  They didn't

roam around much... But now Jesus,

it seems nobody's safe.

GONZO

(with a conspiratorial

nod)

You're going to need to take the

bull by the horns -- go to the mat

with this scum.

80.

DA

What do you mean by that?

GONZO

You know what I mean.  We've done

it before and we can damn well do

it again!

DUKE

Cut their goddamn heads off.  Every

one of them.  That's what we're

doing in California.

DA

(stupefied)

WHAT?

GONZO

Sure.  It's all on the Q.T., but

everybody who matters is with us

all the way down the line.

DUKE

We keep it quiet.  It's not the

kind of thing you'd want to talk

about upstairs.  Not with the press

around.

DA

(recovering slightly)

Hell, no.  We'd never hear the

goddamn end of it.

DUKE

Dobermans don't talk.

DA

What?

GONZO

Sometimes it's easier to just rip

out the backstraps.

DUKE

They'll fight like hell if you try

to take the head without the dogs.

DA

God almighty!

(muttering in a daze)

I don't think I should tell my wife

about this.  She'd never understand.

You know how women are.

81.

DUKE

Just be thankful your heart is

young and strong.

DUKE

What's the message?  My light is

blinking.

CLERK (V/O)

Ah, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one

message: "Call Lucy at the Americana

Hotel, room 1600."

DUKE

Holy shit!

DUKE

Lucy called.

GONZO

What?

CLERK

Mr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm

sorry we were cut off a moment

ago... I thought I should call

again, because I was wondering...

82.

DUKE

WHAT?

(hand over the PHONE)

What was that crazy bitch said to

him?

(screams)

There's a war on, man!  People are

being killed!

CLERK (V/O)

Killed?

DUKE

IN VIETNAM!  ON THE GODDAMN

TELEVISION!

CLERK (V/O)

Oh... yes... yes... This terrible

war.  When will it end?

DUKE

Tell me.  What do you want?

CLERK (V/O)

The woman who left that message for

you sounded very disturbed.  I

think she was crying...

DUKE

Crying?  Why was she crying?

CLERK (V/O)

Well, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.

But since I know you're here with

the Police Convention...

DUKE

Look, you want to be gentle with

that woman if she ever calls again.

We're watching her very carefully...

this woman has been into laudanum.

It's a controlled experiment, but I

suspect we'll need your cooperation

before this thing is over.

CLERK (V/O)

(hesitantly)

Well, certainly... We're always

happy to cooperate with the police...

83.

DUKE

Don't worry.  You're protected.

Just treat this poor woman like

you'd treat any other human being

in trouble.

CLERK (V/O)

What?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what

you mean... Yes... so, you'll be

responsible then?

DUKE

Of course.  And now I have to get

back to the news.  Send up some ice.

GONZO

Good work.  They'll treat us like

goddamn lepers after that.

DUKE

(slowly, carefully)

Lucy is looking for you.

GONZO

(laughing)

No, she's looking for you.

DUKE

Me?

GONZO

She really flipped over you.  The

only way I could get rid of her was

by saying you were taking me out to

the desert for a showdown -- that

you wanted me out of the way so you

could have her all to yourself.

(laughing again)

I guess she figures you won.  That

phone message wasn't for me, was it?

LUCY

Yessir, those two men in the dock

are the ones who gave me the LSD

and took me to the hotel.

84.

LUCY

I don't know for sure what they

done to me, but I remember it was

horrible.

JUDGE

Twenty years... and Double

Castration!

GONZO

Wait!  You can't leave me alone in

this snake pit.  This room is in my

name.

GONZO

OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call

her.  I'll get her off our backs.

You're right.  She's my problem.

DUKE

It's gone too far.

GONZO

Relax.  Let me handle this.

(dials the PHONE,

snaps angrily at DUKE)

You'd make a piss-poor lawyer.

...Room 1600, please.

(to DUKE)

As your attorney, I advise you not

to worry.

(nods towards bathroom)

Take a hit out of that little brown

bottle in my shaving kit.

DUKE

What is this?

85.

GONZO

You won't need much.  Just a little

tiny taste, that stuff makes pure

mescaline seem like ginger-beer.

Adrenochrome.

DUKE

Adrenochrome...

GONZO

(into PHONE)

Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got

your message...what?  Hell, no, I

taught the bastard a lesson he'll

never forget... what?  No, not

dead, but he won't be bothering

anybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left

him out there, I stomped him, then

pulled all his teeth out...

DUKE (V/O)

I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a

terrible thing to lay on somebody

with a head full of acid."

GONZO

(to PHONE)

But here's the problem.  That

bastard cashed a bad check

downstairs and gave you as a

reference.  They'll be looking for

both of you.  Yeah, I know, but you

can't judge a book by its cover,

Lucy.  Some people are just

basically rotten... Anyway, the

last thing you want to do is call

this hotel again; they'll trace the

call and put you straight behind

bars... no, I'm moving to the

Tropicana right away.  I have to

go, they've got the phone tapped.

Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but

it's all over now... OH MY GOD!

THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!

(throws the PHONE

down; shouts)

No!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent!

It was Duke!  I swear to God!

(MORE)

86.

GONZO (CONT'D)

(stomps the PHONE; moans)

No, I don't know where she is.

You'll never catch Lucy!  She's

gone!  I swear, I don't know where

she is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!

(slams the PHONE down)

GONZO

Well.  That's that.  She's probably

stuffing herself down the

incinerator about now.  That's the

last we should be hearing from Lucy.

(fumbling with the

hash pipe)

Where's the opium?

DUKE (V/O)

I remember slumping on the bed, his

performance had given me a bad jolt.

For a moment I thought his mind had

snapped -- that he actually believed

he was being attacked by invisible

enemies.  But the room was quiet

again.

DUKE

Where'd you get this?

GONZO

Never mind, it's absolutely pure.

DUKE

Jesus... what kind of monster

client have you picked up this time?

There's only one source for this

stuff -- the adrenaline gland from

a living human body!

87.

GONZO

I know, but the guy didn't have any

cash to pay me.  He's one of these

Satanism freaks.  He offered me

human blood -- said it would take

me higher than I've ever been in my

life.

(laughs -- struts

round DUKE -- eyes

bright with expectation)

I thought he was kidding, so I told

him I'd just as soon have an ounce

or so of pure adrenochrome -- or

maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland

to chew on.

DUKE (V/O)

I could already feel the stuff

working on me -- the first wave

felt like a combination of mescaline

and methedrine -- maybe I should

take a swim, I thought...

GONZO

Yeah, they nailed this guy for

child molesting.  He swore he

didn't do it. "Why should I fuck

with children?" he says. "They're

too small." Christ, werewolf is

entitled to legal counsel.  I

didn't dare turn the creep down.

He might have picked up a letter

opener and gone after my pineal

gland!

DUKE

Why not?  We should get some of

that.  Just eat a big handful and

see what happens.

GONZO

Some of what?

DUKE

(spitting words)

Extract of pineal!

88.

GONZO

(STARING AT DUKE WITH

A STRANGE SMILE)

Sure.  That's a good idea.  One

whiff of that shit would turn you

into something out of a goddamn

medical encyclopedia.

GONZO

Man, your head would swell up like

a watermelon, you'd probably gain

about a hundred pounds in two

hours...

DUKE

Right!

GONZO

... grow claws... bleeding warts.

DUKE

Yes!

GONZO

... then you'd notice about six

huge hairy tits swelling up on your

back...

DUKE

Fantastic!

GONZO

you'd go blind... your body would

turn to wax... they'd have to put

you in a wheelbarrow and...

89.

GONZO

Man I'll try about anything; but

I'd never touch a pineal gland.

DUKE

FINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What

happened?!  What about the glands?

GONZO

Jesus, that stuff got right on top

of you, didn't it.

DUKE

Maybe you could just... shove me

into the pool, or something...

GONZO

If I put you in the pool right now,

you'd sink like a goddamn stone.

You took too much.  Jesus, look at

your face, you're about to explode.

GONZO

Don't try and fight it, or you'll

get brain bubbles.  Strokes,

aneurysms.  You'll just wither up

and die.

NIXON

Sacrifice... sacrifice...

sacrifice...

90.

DUKE (V/O)

What kind of rat-bastard psychotic

would play that song -- right now,

at this moment?

DUKE (V/O)

When I came to the general back

alley ambiance of the suite was so

rotten, so incredibly foul.  How

long had I been lying there?  Hours?

Days?  Months?  All these signs of

violence.  What had happened?

DUKE (V/O)

There was evidence in this room of

excessive consumption of almost

every type of drug known to

civilized man since 1544 AD.

DUKE (V/O)

But what kind of addict would need

all these coconut husks and crushed

honeydew rinds?  Would the presence

of junkies account for all these

uneaten french fries?  These

puddles of glazed ketchup on the

bureau?  Maybe so, but then why all

this booze?  And these crude

pornographic photos smeared with

mustard that had dried to a hard

yellow crust...

91.

DUKE (V/O)

These were not the hoof prints of

your normal god-fearing junkie.  It

was too savage, too aggressive.

DUKE (V/O)

Grim memories and bad flashbacks.

DUKE (V/O)

Something ugly had happened.  I was

sure of it...

MAID

Please... please... I'm only the

maid.  I didn't mean nothin!...

DUKE

(jumps up from the

bed, flashing his

press badge)

YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

92.

GONZO

(to DUKE)

She must have used a pass key.  I

was polishing my shoes in the

closet when I noticed her sneaking

in-so I took her.

DUKE

(barks at the MAID)

What made you do it?  Who paid you

off?

MAID

Nobody.  I'm the maid!

GONZO

You're lying!  You were after the

evidence.  Who put you up to

this -- the manager?

MAID

I don't know what you're talking

about!

GONZO

Bullshit!  You're just as much a

part of it as they are!

MAID

Part of what?

DUKE

The dope ring.  You must know

what's going on in this hotel.  Why

do you think we're here?

MAID

(blubbering)

I know you're cops, but I thought

you were just here for that

convention.  I swear!  All I wanted

to do was clean up the room.  I

don't know anything about dope!

GONZO

Come on, baby don't try to tell us

you never heard of the Grange Gorman.

93.

MAID

No!  No!  I swear to Jesus I never

heard of that stuff!

DUKE

Maybe she's telling the truth.

Maybe she's not part of it.

MAID

No!  I swear I'm not!

GONZO

(long pause)

In that case, maybe she can help.

MAID

Yes!  I'll help you all you need!

I hate dope!

DUKE

So do we, lady.

GONZO

(helping her up)

I think we should put her on the

payroll.  See what she comes up with.

DUKE

Do you think you can handle it?

MAID

What?

GONZO

One phone call every day.  Just

tell us what you've seen.  Don't

worry if it doesn't add up, that's

our problem.

MAID

You'd pay me for that?

DUKE

You're damn right.  But the first

time you say anything about this,

to anybody -- you'll go straight to

prison for the rest of your life.

What's your name?

MAID

Alice.  Just ring Linen Service and

ask for Alice.

94.

GONZO

Alright, Alice... you'll be

contacted by Inspector Rock.

Arthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a

politician.

DUKE

Inspector Rock will pay you.  In

cash.  A thousand dollars on the

ninth of every month.

MAID

Oh Lord!  I'd do just about anything

for that!

GONZO

You and a lot of other people.

DUKE

The password is: "One Hand Washes

The Other." The minute you hear

that, you say "I fear nothing."

MAID

I fear nothing.

GONZO

Oh, and don't bother to make up the

room.  That way we won't have to

risk another of these little

incidents, will we?

MAID

Whatever you say, gentlemen.  I

can't tell you how sorry I am about

what happened...

GONZO

Don't worry, it's all over now.

Thank God for the decent people.

GONZO ON TAPE

... Thank God for the decent people.

95.

DUKE (V/O)

Memories of that night are extremely

hazy...

DUKE (V/O)

There is a definite obligation,

when you boom around Vegas in a

white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a

certain style.

SHOPPER #1

Hey!  Is that your car?

DUKE

Sure is.

DUKE

Any of you folks want the milk?

We're after the meat.  This is

honest coconut essence.  Real meat.

96.

SHOPPER #2

Meat, hell!  Look what you're doing

to that car!

GONZO

Fuck the car.  They should make

these things with a goddamn FM radio.

DUKE

Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is

sucking our dollar balance dry!

SHOPPER #3

Someone should stop them!

DUKE

You poor fools don't understand, do

you?  This car is the property of

the World Bank!  That money goes to

ITALY!

SHOPPER #3

Somebody should call the police!

GONZO

Police?  Are you people crazy?

GONZO (CONT'D)

You folks every heard of ole

Patrick Henry?  Know what he said?!

GONZO (CONT'D)

(ROARS)

GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!

GONZO (CONT'D)

In Samoa we LOVE THE CONSTITUTION!

SHOPPER #3

Bullshit.

97.

SHOPPER #1

Call the goddamn police!

SHOPPER #4

Look what they've done to that

beautiful car!

DUKE

This crowd is not rational.  They

can't relate to us.  Let's go!

DUKE

You people voted for Hubert Humphrey!

You killed Jesus!

DUKE (V/O)

The crowd broke ranks.  Nobody

wants to be run over by a Coupe de

Ville.

VOICE ON TAPE

You found the American Dream?  In

this town?

DUKE ON TAPE

We're sitting on the main nerve

right now...

98.

DUKE

The manager told me a story about

the owner of this place...about how

he always wanted to run away and

join the circus when he was a kid.

Well, now the bastard has his own

circus, and a license to steal, too.

3RD MAN

You're right -- he's the model.

DUKE

Absolutely!  Pure Horatio Alger...

Say...

DUKE ON TAPE

... how much do you think he'd take

for the ape?

VOICE ON TAPE

Holy God!...

RENTAL AGENT

Holy God!, how did this happen?

DUKE

They beat the shit out of it.

RENTAL AGENT

The top's completely jammed!

DUKE

Yeah, something's wrong with the

motor...

DUKE ON TAPE

... The generator light's been on

red ever since I drove the thing

into Lake Mead on a water test...

99.

DUKE

No, no.  Shit...

DUKE ON TAPE

Where's the ape?  I'm ready to

write a check.

3RD MAN

Forget it, he just attacked an old

man... he took a bite out of the

bartender's head!  The cops took

the ape away.

DUKE

Goddamnit!  What's the bail?  I

want that ape!  I've already

reserved two first-class seats on

the plane.

DUKE (V/O)

There was every reason to believe

that we had been heading for

trouble, that we'd pushed our luck

a bit far...

GONZO

Hey there!  You folks want to buy

some heroin?

100.

GONZO

Hey, honkies!  Goddamnit, I'm

serious.  I want to sell you some

pure fucking smack!

GONZO

Cheap heroin!  This is the real

stuff!  You won't get hooked.  I

just got back from Vietnam!  This

is scag, folks.  Pure scag!

GONZO

Shoot!  Fuck!  Scag!  Blood!

Heroin!  Rape!  Cheap!  Communist!

Jab it right in your fucking

eyeballs!

MAN IN CAR

You dirty bastards!  Pull over and

I'll kill you!  God damn you!  You

bastards!

MAN IN CAR ON TAPE

You dirty bastards!

GONZO ON TAPE

Shit, he was trying to bite me!  I

shoulda maced the fucker!

101.

DUKE

(remembering)

Back door beauty!

DUKE (V/O)

The mentality of Las Vegas is so

grossly atavistic that a really

massive crime often slips by

unrecognized.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)

The possibility of physical and

mental collapse is very real... No

sympathy for the devil; keep that

in mind.  Buy the ticket, take the

ride...

VOICE OFF

Shit!  Faggot!  Bastard!

DUKE (V/O)

North Vegas is where you go when

you've fucked up once too often on

The Strip and when you're not even

welcome in the cut-rate Downtown

places.

DUKE (V/O)

The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed

like a fairly safe haven from our

storms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just

a place to rest and regroup.  I

wasn't even hungry.

102.

DUKE (V/O)

There was nothing in the atmosphere

of the North Star to put me on my

guard...

GONZO

(to WAITRESS)

Two glasses of ice water with ice.

DUKE (V/O)

She looked like a burnt out

caricature of Jane Russell.  She

was definitely in charge here...

DUKE (V/O)

He did it very casually, but I knew

that our peace was about to be

shattered.

DUKE

What was that?

WAITRESS

What is this?

GONZO

A napkin.

WAITRESS

Don't give me that bullshit!  I

know what it means!  You goddamn

fat pimp bastard.

GONZO

That's the name of a horse I used

to own.  What's wrong with you?

WAITRESS

You sonofabitch!  I take a lot of

shit in this place, but I sure as

hell don't have to take it off a

SPIC PIMP!

103.

DUKE (V/O)

Jesus.  I thought, what's happening?

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)

The question mark was emphasized.

WAITRESS

(screams)

Pay your bill and get the hell out!

You want me to call the cops?

GONZO

Spic pimp?

DUKE (V/O)

I was stupid with shock -- not

knowing whether to run or start

laughing.

GONZO

(casual)

How much is the lemon meringue pie?

DUKE (V/O)

Her eyes were turgid with fear, but

her brain was functioning on some

basic motor survival level.

WAITRESS

(blurting -- on automatic)

Thirty-five cents!

GONZO

(laughing)

I mean the whole pie.

GONZO

Let's say five dollars.  Okay?

104.

DUKE (V/O)

The sight of the blade had triggered

bad memories.  The glazed look in

her eyes said her throat had been

cut.  She was still in the grip of

paralysis when we left.

GONZO (V/O)

Drive!  Drive!  Drive!  We have

fifteen fucking minutes to get me

on that plane!

GONZO

What are you doing?  You were

supposed to turn back there!

DUKE (V/O)

We had abused every rule that Vegas

lived by -- burning the locals,

abusing the tourists, terrifying

the help.  The only chance now, I

felt, was the possibility that we'd

gone to such excess that nobody in

the position to bring the hammer

down on us could possibility

believe it.

105.

GONZO

Jesus Christ!!!

GONZO

Goddamnit!  We're lost!  What are

we doing out here on this

godforsaken road?

GONZO

The airport is over there!

DUKE

Never missed a plane yet.

DUKE

I'll drop you right next to the

plane.

GONZO

No!  I can't get out!  They'll

crucify me.  I'll have to take the

blame!

106.

DUKE

(irritatedly)

Ridiculous!  Just say you were

hitchhiking to the airport and I

picked you up.  You never saw me

before.  Shit, this town is full of

white Cadillac convertibles.  I

plan to go through there so fast

that nobody will even glimpse the

goddamn license plate.  You ready?

GONZO

Why not?  But for Christ's sake,

just do it fast!

DUKE

Hey!

DUKE

Don't take any guff from those

swine.  Remember, if you have any

trouble you can always send a

telegram to the Right People.

GONZO

Yeah... Explaining my Position.

Some asshole wrote a poem about

that once...

GONZO

Probably good advice, if you have

shit for brains.

DUKE (V/O)

There he goes -- one of God's own

prototypes -- a high powered mutant

of some kind never even considered

for mass production.  Too weird to

live and too rare to die.

107.

DUKE

We are all wired into a survival

trip now.  No more of the speed

that fueled that 60's.  That was

the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.

He crashed around America selling

"consciousness expansion" without

ever giving a thought to the grim

meat-hook realities that were lying

in wait for all the people who took

him seriously...

DUKE

All those pathetically eager acid

freaks who thought they could buy

Peace and Understanding for three

bucks a hit.  But their loss and

failure is ours too.  What Leary

took down with him was the central

illusion of a whole life-style that

he helped create...

DUKE

... a generation of permanent

cripples, failed seekers, who never

understood the essential old-mystic

fallacy of the Acid Culture: the

desperate assumption that somebody...

or at least some force -- is

tending the light at the end of the

tunnel.

108.

DUKE (V/O)

There was only one road back to L.A.

US Interstate 15, just a flat-out

high speed burn through Baker and

Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the

Hollywood Freeway straight into

frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,

just another freak in the Freak

Kingdom.

DUKE

Ahhh.  Wonderful.

PROPRIETOR

What'll you have?

DUKE

(doubtfully)

Ballantine Ale...?

DUKE

Hard to find it served like this

anymore.

109.

PROPRIETOR

Where ya comin' from, young man?

DUKE

Las Vegas.

PROPRIETOR

A great town, that Vegas.  I bet

you had good luck there.  You're

the type.

DUKE

I know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.

PROPRIETOR

(trustingly)

That's a fine combination.  You

can't lose.

DUKE

(caught off guard... muttering)

Oh, my God!...

PROPRIETOR

(not understanding)

This is my granddaughter...

DUKE

(recovering)

Don't worry...

(leans forward in confidence)

... and I'm actually the District

Attorney from Ignoto County.

(winks)

Just another good American like

yourself.

110.

DUKE

HOLY SHIT!!!

DUKE

GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!

DUKE (V/O)

My heart was filled with joy.  I

felt like a monster reincarnation

of Horatio Alger... a man on the

move... and just sick enough to be

totally confident.
