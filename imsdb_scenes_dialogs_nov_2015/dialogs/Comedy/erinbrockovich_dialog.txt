ERIN BROCKOVICH

A True Story

by

Susannah Grant

February 1, 1998

ERIN

Fuck.

ERIN

Shit.

ERIN

God

damn

it.

ROSALIND (O.S.)

Morning, Mr. Masry.  How you doing today?

ED

Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind.

BRENDA

Tony Marvin.

ED

Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain

and suffering this time?

BRENDA

His dry cleaners.  You want him?

ED

What do you think?  What's this?

BRENDA

Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.

ED

Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.

BRENDA

He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's

your nine o'clock in there.

ED

Whoa.

(to Brenda)

Remind me.

BRENDA

Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her

fault, she says.

(sarcastic)

And she looks like such an honest girl, don't

you think?

ED

You shouldn't judge, Brenda.

BRENDA

Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.

BRENDA

I can't find him, Tony.  We'll have to call

you back.

ED

Erin -- hi.  Sorry you had to wait.  Here,

sit down, sit down.

ERIN

Thanks a lot.

(as she sits)

I tell you, I never thought just standing

would take it out of me, but ever since that

shithead hit me, it feels like my whole

body's put together wrong.

ED

Jesus, you poor thing.

(he sits)

Well, listen, you came to the right place.

Whoever did this to you made one hell of a

mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make

him pay for it.

ED

Why don't you tell me what happened?

DISSOLVE TO:

ERIN

I was pulling out real slow, and out of

nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the

corner like a bat outta hell ...

ERIN

They took some bone from my hip and put it

in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm

about seventeen thousand in debt right now.

ERIN

... couldn't take painkillers cause they

made me too groggy to take care of my kids.

ERIN

... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's

just nine months.

ERIN

... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person,

a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care

of my kids.  You know?

ED

(oh so moved)

Yeah.  I know.

DEFENDING LAWYER

Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your

ex-husband helping out?

ERIN

Which one?

DEFENDING LAWYER

(feigning shock)

There's more than one?

ERIN

Yeah.  There's two.  Why?

ERIN

(getting defensive)

... not like a career, cause I had my babies.

But I woulda worked, for sure, if I didn't

have this neck thing.

DEFENDING LAWYER

(sarcastic)

Right.  No doubt.

DEFENDING LAWYER

So.  You must've been feeling pretty

desperate that afternoon.

ERIN

(pointed)

What's your point?

DEFENDING LAWYER

Broke, three kids, no job.  A doctor in a

Jaguar must've looked like a pretty good

meal ticket.

ERIN

What?  Hey --

he

hit

me

.

DEFENDING LAWYER

So you say.

ERIN

He came tearing around the corner, out of

control --

DEFENDING LAWYER

An ER doctor who spends his days saving

lives was the one out of control --

ERIN

(erupting)

That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!

ERIN

Open and shut?

Open and fucking shut

?

ED

If you hadn't used profanity --

ERIN

Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God

damn, he made me look like some cheap --

ED

I told you the questions might get a little

personal --

ERIN

Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a

million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.

ED

Okay -- let's try and settle down here.

ERIN

Settle down

?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr.

Masry!  I can't

afford

to settle down!

ED

I'm sorry, Erin.

ERIN

Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my

kids.

MRS. MORALES

Hi, Erin!  You're back so soon.  How was it?

ERIN

Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where

are Matt and Katie?

MRS. MORALES

Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?

ERIN

It'll be fine, yeah.

MRS. MORALES

Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell

you before, with your worries --

ERIN

What?

MRS. MORALES

My daughter, she's bought a big house with a

room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.

ERIN

You're moving away?  When?

MRS. MORALES

Next week.

ERIN

(stunned)

Wow, that's soon --

MRS. MORALES

I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can

help my daughter take care of my grandkids.

And it's good for you, too.  Now you have

money, you can find a good babysitter, huh?

Not the old lady next door.

ERIN

Ugh.

MATTHEW

I don't like this part, it's all crusty.

KATIE

I like the crust.

ERIN

Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.

KATIE

How come you're not eating?

ERIN

Mamma's gonna eat later.

ERIN

Don't go getting sick on me, baby.  Okay?

ERIN

It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.  I promise.

ERIN

Hi, remember me?  I was in yesterday.  Bought

a whole mess of stuff?  Round about five?

CHECK-OUT LADY

Honey, it's a zoo here at five.  I'm lucky

if I even see a face, much less remember it.

ERIN

Oh, shoot, yeah, I guess that'd be tough.

Well, listen, I meant to buy my baby here

some medicine, and by the time I got home, I

realized I'd bought the adult stuff by

mistake.  And now, wouldn't you know, I

can't find the receipt.  I was wondering --

could I maybe exchange it anyway ...

ERIN

Just remember.  No matter what your Mamma

does, lying and stealing is real bad.  I

don't ever wanna hear you doing something

like that ...

ERIN

... Cause there's no excuse for it, you hear

me?  No excuse at all.

ED

Damn it!

(calling out)

Brenda!

BRENDA

Yeah?

ED

What the hell is this doing here?

BRENDA

It's those files you asked for.

ED

I didn't mean for you to leave them in the

middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me.

What do I have this afternoon?

BRENDA

Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.

ED

What's she doing here?

BRENDA

Who?

ED

Hey -- Mario -- what's she doing here?

MARIO

She works here.

ED

Erin!  How's it going?

ERIN

You never called me back.  I left messages.

ED

You did?  Wow, sorry about that.

(beat)

Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He

seems to think that you said --

ERIN

There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry.

Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did

both.

ED

I never lied.  I may have miscalculated --

that happens sometimes, but --

ERIN

You said things would be fine, and they're

not.

ED

I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --

ERIN

I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And

I've looked, but when you've spent the last

six years raising babies, it's real hard to

convince someone to give you a job that pays

worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the

one who said I was gonna be okay, you should

be the one to hire me.

ED

I'd love to help, Erin, but I'm sorry, I

have a full staff right now, so --

ERIN

Bullshit.  If you had a full staff, you'd

have time to return your damn phone calls.

ED

Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for

a job here, you can do it the way everyone

else does.  Send in a rEsumE, make an --

ERIN

I'm

not

everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm

someone you made promises to that you didn't

deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids'

well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard-

working, and I'll do anything.  But if you

think I'm leaving here without a job, you

got another thing coming.

ED

No benefits.

ANNA

... what we do in here is keep track of all

the case files.  That way, at any time, we

can find out a case's status -- where it is

in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em

all here, alphabetically --

ERIN

Oh, hell.

(beat)

I'm dyslexic.

ANNA

That's a joke, right?

JANE

Just last week, he told my sister we weren't

hiring.

BRENDA

What's your sister look like?

ERIN

Mr. Masry?

ED

Yeah?

ERIN

I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd

talk to about maybe getting an advance on my

paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.

ED

Jane's the office manager.  She handles

payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early

on Fridays.

ERIN

Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.

ED

Oh, for Christ's sake ...

ED

All I have is hundreds.

ERIN

I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.

ED

Bullshit, you don't.

KATIE

Mommy, can I get a flower?

ERIN

Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.

ERIN

Hey!

ERIN

HEY!

GEORGE

Well, hello to you, darlin'.

ERIN

What the hell do you think you're doing,

making all that Goddamn noise?

GEORGE

Just introducing myself to the neighbors.

ERIN

Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're

introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.

GEORGE

Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a

beautiful woman next door, I'da done this

different.  Let's start over.  My name's

George.  What's yours?

ERIN

Just think of me as the person next door who

likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.

GEORGE

Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what.

How about if I take you out on a date to

apologize for my rudeness?

GEORGE

Come on.  Gimme your number, I'll call you

up proper and ask you out and everything.

ERIN

You want my number?

GEORGE

I do.

ERIN

Which number do you want, George?

GEORGE

You got more than one?

ERIN

Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of

my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.

GEORGE

Ten?

ERIN

Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how

many months old my little girl is.

GEORGE

You got a little girl?

ERIN

Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five.

That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven

is my son's age.  Two is how many times I

been married and divorced.  You getting all

this?  16 is the number of dollars in my

bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number.

And with all the other numbers I gave you,

I'm guessing zero is the number of times

you're gonna call it.

GEORGE

How the hell do you know your bank balance

right off the top of your head like that?

See, that impresses me.

ERIN

Y'all got something you wanna discuss?

ED

Damn it!

(calling out)

Brenda!

(no answer)

BRENDA!

ERIN

How long's she been crying like that? ...

Well, she's got that tooth coming in --

ERIN

Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --

(sees Ed)

I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that

bag -- I'll check back in a bit.

(hangs up)

Sorry.  My kid --

ED

Where's Anna?

ERIN

Out to lunch with the girls.

ED

Oh.  Huh.

(beat)

Well, look, I got this file I need valued.

Real estate thing.  A lady has some property

next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy.

I need to know what to ask for it.

ERIN

Oh.  Okay.

ED

You do know how to do that, don't you?

ERIN

Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.

ED

Good.

ED

You're a girl.

ERIN

Excuse me?

ED

How come you're not at lunch with the girls?

You're a girl.

ERIN

I guess I'm not the right kind.

ERIN

Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff -

- could you remind me, cause I'm a little

confused about how exactly we do that.

ANNA

(exasperated)

Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you

don't know how to do your job by now, I am

not about to do it for you.

ERIN

Ugh.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Hey, neighbor, wanna beer?

ERIN

No.

GEORGE

C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for

that night.

ERIN

Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money

back.

GEORGE

Now, why're you giving me such a hard time?

I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.

ERIN

I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60

and Mexican and she watched my kids for

free.  Something tells me you're not gonna

be able to measure up to that.

GEORGE

You need help with your kids?  I could

probably do that.

ERIN

I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.

GEORGE

Why not?

ERIN

Cause I don't even know you.

GEORGE

Yeah, and whose fault is that?

GEORGE

What, you got so many friends in this world,

you don't have use for one more?

KATIE

What's that stand for?

GEORGE

That's for Harley Davidson.  The best damn

motorcycle ever made.

ERIN

And if I catch either of you anywhere near

one, I'll knock you silly.  Go on to bed,

now -- I'll come tuck you in in a minute.

GEORGE

Night.

KATIE/MATT

Night.

GEORGE

Great kids.

ERIN

Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.

GEORGE

How?

ERIN

I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this

weird sitter all afternoon who costs a

fortune and smells like chicken fat.

GEORGE

I was serious before, you know.  If you need

someone to keep an eye on them -- after

school or something -- I don't have a job

now, so I'm around in the afternoons.

ERIN

Great.  Another deadbeat.

GEORGE

I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.

ERIN

Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the

time, live off your trust fund?

GEORGE

I do construction, which pays real good.

And I make it last by living cheap.

ERIN

(with a little laugh)

I hope that's not supposed to impress me.

GEORGE

Are you this hard on everyone who tries to

help you?

ERIN

It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of

practice.

GEORGE

Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is

to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer,

I don't mind taking you up on it.

ERIN

Why in the hell would you want to watch my

kids?

GEORGE

Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with

them.

ERIN

Right.

GEORGE

I do.  I like how they keep it all simple,

you know?  They don't get all complicated

about life, like grown-ups do.  A bicycle

and an ice cream cone -- boom, done, they're

happy.

ERIN

You're around every afternoon?

GEORGE

Yup.  Usually working on my bike.

(she's tempted)

No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you

can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.

ERIN

This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.

GEORGE

(with a laugh)

Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?

ERIN

It was in this real estate file I'm valuing.

And -- see, I know they're the medical

records from the people selling the house --

but it talks about things like lymphocytes

and T8 suppressers.

ERIN

I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but

-- I'm just a little unclear on what those

things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.

JANE

What do I look like, Erin?  A library?

ROSALIND (O.S.)

Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?

ERIN (O.S.)

Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich.

From the file room?  I was wondering if you

could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up

on that real estate thing out of the office.

ERIN

Dr. Paulsen?

PAULSEN

Yes?

ERIN

Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in

the library there, asking a mess of

questions about -- I guess they call it

epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me

to find you, cause you know all about it.

PAULSEN

(suspicious)

Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to

this?

ERIN

Who's Baxter?

PAULSEN

He did, didn't he?

Baxter

!

BAXTER

Yeah?

PAULSEN

Oh.  Oh.

ERIN

No one put me up to anything.  I was just

hoping I could ask you a couple questions.

PAULSEN

(mortified)

Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --

PAULSEN

Well, look, there isn't a ton of information

here, but from what there is, I'd say that

these two people here -- what are their

names?  Shanna and Ashley?

ERIN

Right, I guess those are the kids --

PAULSEN

They've both got some immune system problem.

Can't say what from, whether it's viral or

genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And

these guys -- Donna and Peter --

ERIN

Their parents, I'm pretty sure.

PAULSEN

Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say

they both have some form of cancer.

ERIN (O.S.)

Whoa, whoa!  Easy, easy, easy --

DONNA'S VOICE (O.S.)

Hi!  You've reached the Irvings.  Leave a

message and we'll get back to you just as

soon as we can.  Bye-bye.

ERIN

Hi.  Donna Irving?

DONNA

Yes?

ERIN

I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?

DONNA

(a little surprised)

You're a lawyer?

ERIN

Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for

them.  You got a minute?

ERIN

This is a real nice place you got here.

DONNA (O.S.)

Well it oughta be, with all the work I put

into it.

DONNA

I added air conditioning, put in the pool,

made all those pillows by hand ...

ERIN

Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that.

They make the place feel real homey.

DONNA

Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm

being such a stickler on this house price

thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's

backside, especially after all they've done

for Hinkley, but I look around here and I

think, if they want this place, they're

gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just

mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay

me for the trouble of starting over.

ERIN

Right.

DONNA

Cause first you gotta move, then there's

decorating, and if the windows aren't the

same size, you know -- you're making all new

curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I

have the energy.  You know, I've been sick.

Me and Peter both have.

ERIN

Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I

was going through your file here, and I ran

into these medical records.  They kinda

surprised me --

DONNA

I know.  They're more than a bit unusual.

See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's

disease.  That's a kind of cancer --

ERIN

Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.

DONNA

Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the

Lord, but you never know.  And then while

that's going on, I end up having to have a

hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps

removed from my breasts.  All benign so far,

but still, no matter how positive you stay,

an operation can still take it out of you.

ERIN

I'll say.  Holy moley.

DONNA

So the whole idea of selling the house --

don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to

some better place, but if they aren't gonna

pay us properly, I just don't see the point.

ERIN

Yeah, I can see that.

(beat)

I guess the only thing that confused me is -

- not that your medical problems aren't

important, but -- how come the files about

them are in with all the real estate stuff?

DONNA

Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if

I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I

just kept all PG&E correspondence in one

place.

ERIN

Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you

were corresponding with PG&E about it in the

first place.

DONNA

Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.

ERIN

They did?

DONNA

You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole

family.  And not like with insurance where

you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed,

either.  They just took care of it.  Just

like that.  We never even saw a bill.

ERIN

Wow.  Why would they do that?

DONNA

Cause of the chromium.

ERIN

The what?

DONNA

The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this

whole thing off.

DONNA (O.S.)

PG&E came around a few years ago, told us

they put chromium in our well by mistake.

And since we shouldn't have to drink it if

we don't want to, they gave us free spring

water and offered to buy our house.

ERIN

What's chromium?

DONNA

It's a chemical they used over at that

compressor station up the road there.

ERIN

Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have

been so sick --

DONNA

I thought the same thing, right off the bat.

That's why we went to see the doctor.  But

hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do

with the other.

DONNA

This is the info they gave us.  You'll see

if you look through it, chromium's good for

you.  When I saw what they charged for it at

the health-food stores, I about fainted.

ERIN

Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your

water being messed with and you being so

sick.

DONNA

Not around here.  This is a rough part of

the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money,

not a lot of luck.

(beat)

It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town

like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.

ERIN

What're you doing?

GEORGE

Better safe than sorry.

ERIN

You want some coffee, George?

GEORGE

I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front

door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest

neighborhood in the world, you know.

ERIN

Thanks for reminding me.

GEORGE

I guess we get what we pay for, huh?

ERIN

You think it could make you sick, living in

a place like this?

GEORGE

What do you mean?

ERIN

I was talking to this lady -- she and her

husband both got cancer, and she thinks it's

cause they live in a bad neighborhood.  You

think that's possible?  That living in a bad

neighborhood could give you cancer?

GEORGE

Man, I hope not.  You got enough damn

problems.

ERIN

Hi, y'all -- how you doing today?

MAN 1

Hangin' in, baby.  How about yourself?

ERIN

I'm okay, I'm just fine.  I was wondering --

could I maybe ask you a couple questions?

ERIN

... and when I realized our area's just as

bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors

are all sick too.  So I went and asked.

PAULSEN

(surprised)

You did?

ERIN

Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on

doors.  And you know what?  They're not.

(reads from the pad)

I mean, they got problems, but none of this

cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So

I don't know -- I just can't shake the

feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they

put in the water.

PAULSEN

Well, if you're talking about contamination,

you're getting out of my area of expertise.

Let me give you the name of a toxicologist

friend of mine over at USC.

PAULSEN

I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I

did not peg you as the kind to go off and

conduct her own epidemiological study.

ERIN

Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my

reputation.

FRANKEL

What kind of chromium is it?

ERIN

There's more than one kind?

FRANKEL

Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does

all kinds of good things for the body.

There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and

then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium,

which, depending on the amounts, can be very

harmful.

ERIN

Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?

FRANKEL

With repeated exposure to toxic levels --

God, anything, really -- respiratory

disease, liver failure, heart failure,

reproductive failure, chronic headaches,

bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of

course, any type of cancer.

ERIN

So that stuff -- it kills people.

FRANKEL

Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly

carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.

ERIN

Well, how do I find out what kind of

chromium is up in Hinkley?

FRANKEL

Have you been to the water board?

ERIN

Hunh-uh.  What's that?

FRANKEL

Every county has one.  They keep records of

anything water-related within their

jurisdiction.  You should be able to find

something there.

ERIN

County water board.  All righty, thanks.

FRANKEL

Good luck.

(beat)

Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're

looking for if I were you ...

FRANKEL (O.S.)

... Incriminating records have a way of

disappearing when people smell trouble.

ERIN

Whew!  God

damn

, that's a heavy door.

ROSS

Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.

ERIN

Thank you very much.  Aren't you a

gentleman?  Mr. ...

ROSS

Ross.

ERIN

Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.

ROSS

Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?

ERIN

Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl

for some water records.

ROSS

(with a laugh)

You come to the right place.

ERIN

(laughing along)

I guess I did.

ROSS

You just tell me what you want to look at

and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.

ERIN

I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's

fighting his water bill, and he wants me to

find all manner of bills from all kinds of

places.  The easiest thing would probably be

if I just squeezed back there with you and

poked around myself.  Would that be okay?

ROSS

Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need

you to sign in here --

ROSS

Pattee?  That your middle name?

ERIN

Nope.  Maiden.

ROSS

(disappointed)

You're married.

ERIN

Not anymore.

ERIN

Well.  Here goes nothing.

MATT

Our mom gives us sandwiches on Fridays.

GEORGE

That's a sandwich.

KATIE

No, it's not!

GEORGE

Sure it is.  Here, I'll show you.

GEORGE

Most people think a sandwich's gotta have

bread on the outside.  Not true.  Chicken is

a perfectly good outside for a sandwich.

GEORGE

See?

ERIN (O.S.)

"... On December 7, 1987, the discharger

notified the regional board and the San

Bernardino County Environmental Health

Services of the discovery of 0.58 ppm of

hexavalent chromium in an on-site ground

water monitoring well ..."

(beat)

... hexavalent ...

ERIN

Where's my stuff?

ANNA

Where've you been?

ERIN

What the fuck did you do with my stuff?

ANNA

Don't use language with me --

ERIN

Someone stole my stuff.

JANE

Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.

ERIN

I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --

JANE

-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of

hose.  Here.

ERIN

What's going on?

JANE

There may be jobs where you can disappear

for days at a time, but this isn't one of

them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you

don't get to stay.

ERIN

I've

been

working.  Shit, that's

all

I've

been doing.  Ask Mr. Masry.  He knows.

ERIN

You said to fire me?

ED

Erin, you've been gone for a week.

ERIN

I left a message.  I've been dealing with

that real estate thing.  I was gonna write

up a whole damn report and --

ED

That's not how we work here.  You don't just

leave a message and take off.

ERIN

What am I supposed to do, check in every two

seconds?

JANE

Yes.  It's called accountability.

ERIN

I am not talking to you, bitch.

JANE

Excuse me

?

ED

Okay, enough --

(beat)

Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I

don't think this is the right place for you.

So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on

your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?

ERIN

Don't bother.

ED

Come on, I'm trying to help here.

ERIN

Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty

about firing someone with three kids to

feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.

ERIN

I don't suppose any one of you cunts could

open the fucking door for me.

MAILMAN

Here ya go, Miz Brockovich.

ERIN

What are you doing here?

GEORGE

Fixing a leak under your sink.

ERIN

I didn't ask you to do that.  Damn it,

George, I don't ask you to do things like

that.

ERIN

Great.

GEORGE

I'm gonna clean it up.

GEORGE

Relax, Erin, I'll do it -- I'm not --

ERIN

Ugh --

Jesus

--

GEORGE

Yeah -- you had a whole family of those

things hanging out back there.

ERIN

Damn it --

GEORGE

Don't worry about it, I'll get it later.

ERIN

Come here, you little motherfucker --

GEORGE

Hey, whoa -- relax --

ERIN

GOD DAMN IT

!

ERIN

(almost a whisper)

... God damn it.

ERIN

What kind of person lives like this?  Huh?

What kind of person lets her kids run around

in a house crawling with bugs the size of

housecats?

GEORGE

It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them.

All we gotta do is call an exterminator.

ERIN

I

can't

call an exterminator.  I can't afford

one.  God, I can't even afford my

phone

.

(beat)

I got fired.

GEORGE

What?  But you been working so hard --

ERIN

Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of

difference.

(then, fragile)

Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me?

How'd I end up so ... so

nothing

?

GEORGE

You're not nothing, Erin.

ERIN

Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I

was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of

those great lives, with everything all laid-

out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss

Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you

that?  You live next door to a real live

beauty queen.

(wipes her nose)

I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I

thought it meant something.  I thought it

meant I was gonna do something great with my

life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow

up to be someone.

GEORGE

You are someone.

ERIN

No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.

GEORGE

You're someone to me.

(beat)

You're someone real special to me.

ERIN

I'm no good, George.  I make people

miserable.

GEORGE

Man.  Even your earlobes are beautiful.

ERIN

Don't be too nice to me, okay?  It makes me

nervous.

ED

Brenda!

(no answer)

BRENDA!

ED

Yeah, Ed Masry here ... She doesn't work

here anymore.  Who's this?

ERIN

Come on, baby.  Maybe that's Ed McMahon.

ERIN

What are you doing here?

ED

I got an interesting call this afternoon.

It was from a Dr. Frankel.

ERIN

Oh, yeah?

ED

He wanted you to know the legal limit for

hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per

million.  And that at the rate you

mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for

the cancers in that family you asked about.

The Irvings.

ERIN

Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny

how some people go out of their way to help

people and others just give 'em the ax?

ED

Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just

assumed you were off having fun.

ERIN

Now, why in the hell would you assume that?

ED

I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like

someone who has a lot of fun.

ERIN

Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.

ED

So what's the story on this thing?  This

cancer stuff?

ERIN

You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I

got a lot of bills to pay.

ED

Fine.

ED

But, PG&E told her about the chromium?

ERIN

They told her something, but it can't have

been too specific, cause I talked to her,

and she sure didn't think her water was bad.

ED

So what made you think it was?

ERIN

It doesn't take a genius to look at those

medical records and think something's wrong.

ED

What medical records?

ERIN

The ones in the box of files.

(off Ed's blank look)

The box of files?  The one from your office?

ED

I didn't see any medical records in there.

ERIN

Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it

then, huh?

(to herself)

And

you

fired

me

.  Jesus.

ED

That document you found, the one that says

it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen

to make a copy did you?

ERIN

Course I did.

ED

Lemme see it, will you?

ERIN

I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including

dental.

ED

Look, Erin, this is not the way I do

business, this extortion nonsense.

ED

Okay.  A 5% raise, and --

ERIN

Ten.

(off his look)

There's a lot of other places I could work.

ED

A ten percent raise and benefits.  But

that's it.  I'm drawing the line.

ED

This is the only thing you found?

ERIN

So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I

wouldn't be surprised if there's more.

ED

Find out.

MATTHEW (O.S.)

I hate this music.

ERIN

There's no way a son of mine hates Funky

Town.  It's impossible.

MATTHEW

Well I hate it.

KATIE

I hate it too.  I hate this trip.

ERIN

Oh, come on, where's your sense of

adventure?  We're going someplace you never

been before.

KATIE

I'm gonna hate it.

MATTHEW

Me too.

ERIN

You know what I'm realizing for the first

time?  You kids are a couple of downers.  I

mean, you are the real thing -- a couple of

honest-to-God depresso-types.

(small smile)

Who in the heck raised you, anyway?  Some

kind of moron?

KATIE

Yeah.  A real moron.

ERIN

Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired,

bimbo, I bet.

MATTHEW

(also smiling)

Yeah.

ERIN

Thank God we got you away from her, huh?

ERIN

Stay out of the road.  I'll be right back.

MATTHEW (O.S.)

I'm hungry.

ERIN

We'll go eat in a minute.  Settle down.

ROSS

You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time

here.  Why don't you let me do that for you,

and you can get your kids some dinner.

ERIN

Ross -- you are an absolute angel.

ED

Fax these to this number, okay?

BRENDA

All of 'em?

ED

All of them.

DONNA

An on-site monitoring well?  That means --

ERIN

It was right up on the PG&E property over

there.

DONNA

And you say this stuff, this hexavalent

chromium -- it's poisonous?

ERIN

Yeah.

DONNA

Well -- then it's gotta be a different than

what's in our water, cause ours is okay.

The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right

in the kitchen and said it was fine.

ERIN

I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking

to?  He gave me a list of problems that can

come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And

everything you all have is on that list.

DONNA

No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the

doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely

nothing to do with the other.

ERIN

Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by

PG&E?

DONNA

ASHLEY!  SHANNA!

DONNA

OUT OF THE POOL!  BOTH OF YOU, OUT OF THE

POOL,

RIGHT NOW

!

SHANNA

How come?

DONNA

CAUSE I SAID SO, THAT'S WHY, NOW GET OUT!

OUT!  NOW!!!

BRENDA

What's she doing here?

JANE

He hired her back.  With a raise.

BRENDA

What??

Why

?

JANE

Well, let's see.  It's not cause she's

smart, and it's not cause she's

professional.  That leaves ...

BRENDA

And dumb old me thought working hard and

being loyal was the way to get ahead.

ED

I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the

fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed

that send button -- PG&E claims department

is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.

ERIN

So you think we got 'em scared?

ED

It sure as hell sounded like they were

sitting up and taking notice.

BRENDA

David Baum from PG&E is at reception.

ERIN

Nice to see you again, too, Brenda.

ERIN

Not to question your judgment or anything,

Mr. Masry, but -- that doesn't exactly look

like sitting up and taking notice to me.

BAUM

... in the interest of putting this whole

thing to rest, PG&E is willing to offer the

Irvings 250,000 dollars for their home.

ED

250,000?

BAUM

In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr.

Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.

ED

What about in terms of medical expenses?

250,000 doesn't come close to what this

family's gonna have to spend on doctors.

BAUM

I understand they've had a bad run of luck,

health-wise, and they have my sympathies.

But that's not PG&E's fault.

ED

You're kidding, right?

(Baum doesn't answer)

Look at these readings for Christ's sake.

PG&E's own technicians documented toxic

levels of hexavalent chromium in those test

wells, on numerous occasions.

ED

Everything the Irvings have had is a proven

reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium.

They've had ...

ERIN

-- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's

disease, immune deficiencies, asthma,

chronic nosebleeds.

BAUM

A million things could have caused those

problems.  Poor diet, bad genes,

irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final

and more than fair.

ED

Wait a minute -- I thought we were

negotiating here.

BAUM

250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.

ED

(to himself)

Jesus Christ.

(he stands, to leave)

I will present your offer to my clients.  I

doubt they'll accept it.

BAUM

Mr. Masry, before you go off on some

crusade, you might want to remember who it

is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28-

billion dollar corporation.

ED

(containing his anger)

Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.

ERIN

At least they made an offer.

ED

That wasn't an offer.  A million would've

been an offer.  When they send the God damn

mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my

time, it's a fuck you.

ERIN

I don't get why they'd do that.

ED

Because they can.  You heard that kid --

they have 28 billion dollars at their

disposal.  They can afford to waste all the

time in the world.

ERIN

And you can't?

ED

What, you think I'm made of money?

BAUM

Hey, you know where I can get a cab?  My

plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes.

ED

Tell you what, why don't you go on over to

reception, tell them I said Mario should

take you to the airport.

BAUM

Hey, excellent.  Thanks.

ERIN

Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the

bathroom.  They'll be driving around the

valley for hours.

ED

(gleeful)

Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?

ERIN

Well I'll be God damned.

ROSALIND

You've been reading for hours.

ERIN

I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact

that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".

ROSALIND

Hey, just so long as you see Him.

MANDY

Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?

ERIN

Yeah.  Who are you?

TOM

I'm Tom Brown.  This is my wife Mandy.  We

used to live across the street from the

Irvings.  PG&E bought our house last year.

TOM

It's called wry neck.  It's when they're

born without any muscles in the neck.

ERIN

Wow.  How many were born like this?

TOM

Twelve, maybe thirteen.

MANDY

When Donna told us about you, and what you

told her about the chromium, we figured that

might have something to do with this, too.

ERIN

It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.

MANDY

There's something else, too.

ERIN

What?

TOM

Well.  Mandy here's had nine miscarriages.

ERIN

Are you kidding?  My God --

MANDY

I know.  It's an awful lot.

ERIN

I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.

TOM

She doesn't know.  No one does.  It's not

something you want to talk about, you know?

MANDY

I figured it musta been something I did,

like when I smoked marijuana, maybe.  Or

took birth control pills.  But then Donna

told me you thought this chromium might be

to blame for her problems, so I figured ...

ERIN

Hey.  You guys still awake?

ERIN

Come on, now.  No faking.  George told me he

just shut out the light a few seconds ago.

ERIN

Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this

job is, things come up at the last minute,

real important things, and I gotta deal with

them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner

any more than you do, but we're all gonna

have to get used to it, cause the fact is,

it's gonna happen sometimes.

KATIE

It happens all the time.

ERIN

That's not true; we had dinner together just

last night.

MATT

You were reading the whole time.

ERIN

I'm sorry, pumpkins.  I'll try a whole lot

harder to be around, okay?  I promise.

GEORGE

If it's any consolation,

I

love you.

ED

It's Sinatra's world, we just live in it.

ED

Hello? ...

(his voice softens)

Hi, babys.  Baby's fine.  Yes, I did.  I

did, too, you just didn't feel it.

ED

You think I could leave without kissing my

babys?  Okay, here you go.

ED

Bye-bye ... bye-bye ... no, you.  Okay,

together.  Bye-bye.

ERIN

Um -- you mind pulling over?  Just -- for a

second?

ERIN

First of all, don't talk baby talk to your

wife in front of me.  It

really

undermines

your authority.  And second, I know you're

my boss and all, but you are the worst

fucking driver I've ever seen.  Move over or

I quit.

PETE (O.S.)

There's something about this whole thing I

don't quite understand, Mr. Masry.

PETE

If PG&E messed with our water, why would

they bother saying anything about it to us?

Why not just keep quiet about it?

ED

To establish a statute of limitations.  See,

in a case like this, you only have a year

from the time you first learn about the

problem to file suit.  So PG&E figures,

we'll let the cat out of the bag -- tell the

people the water's not perfect; if we can

ride out the year with no one suing, we'll

be in the clear forever.

DONNA

But it was more than a year ago that they

told us --

ED

It's okay.  We're not suing.  All we're

doing is using this information to get you

a real nice purchase price on your house,

and get you two --

(to the Browns)

-- a comparable retroactive bonus added to

your sale price.  This way, and PG&E can

still look good to their shareholders, cause

they're not involved in an ugly lawsuit; all

they're doing is buying a little property.

ROY

It doesn't say here how much this whole

thing's gonna cost us.

ED

My fee's forty percent of whatever you get

awarded.

ERIN

Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I

heard that number, I said you got to be

kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?

ED

Erin --

ERIN

I'm the one who's injured, and this joker

who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk

away with almost half my reward?

ED

Erin --

ERIN

Then I asked him how much he makes if I

didn't get anything.

ED

Then I don't get anything either.

ERIN

And I realized, he's taking a chance too.

ED

All right, then.  Let's hit the road.

ERIN

(whispering)

Mr. Masry, if you don't mind my saying, you

got a lot to learn about being friendly.

These people just hired you as their lawyer.

The least you could do is make a little

pleasant conversation.

ERIN

Donna, let me help you clean all this up.

ED

So, what's, uh ... what's new?

MANDY

You know that thing it says in here about

rashes?

ERIN

Uh-huh?

MANDY

Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood

-- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed

like someone in his family always had a rash

somewhere or other.  I just figured it was

something in the genes.  And you know how it

is -- you don't like to ask about things

like that ...

ERIN (O.S.)

Excuse me.  Are you Mr. Linwood?

LINWOOD

Yeah?

ERIN

I'm Erin Brockovich.  I work at the law firm

that represents your former neighbors the

Browns.  They suggested I give you a call.

ERIN

Boy howdy, did I ever wear the wrong shoes.

ERIN

... and Mr. Linwood seemed to think that

your husband had been sick as well.

MARY

Yes, Mr. DeSoto has lung cancer.  Never

smoked a day in his life, neither.

ERIN

Mrs. DeSoto said she wasn't sure exactly

what it was that you had --

PETE

She's not alone on that one.

LAURA

Well, they know what it is -- it's called

fibrous dysplasia --

PETE

The bones start growing again.  Gives her

headaches like you wouldn't believe.

LAURA

-- they just don't know what caused it.

ERIN

... then Mike Ambrosino remembered seeing

you folks at the hospital from time to time

too, so I thought I'd just stop by.

(to Annabelle)

You must be Annabelle.

ANNABELLE

Uh-huh.

ERIN

Whew, are you ever a beauty.  I mean, you

must drive those boys crazy.

ERIN

Tell me something, George.  What kind of God

lets a beautiful little 10-year-old girl get

brain cancer?  Isn't He supposed to be in

charge of stuff like that?  Make sure it

doesn't happen?

(beat)

I swear, any other job, He'd be fired.

ED

Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.

ERIN

That's crazy -- why not?

ED

Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason

PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a

quiet little real estate dispute.  We add

plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle

of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem --

against a massive utility.  No, thank you.

ERIN

Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up

to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest

people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend

every single day watching their little girl

fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll

tell them we can't help them cause you don't

feel like working that hard.

ED

It's not about working hard --

ERIN

Bullshit.

ED

-- It's about being realistic.  Something

like this, Erin -- it could take forever.

They're a huge corporation.  They'd

completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just

one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.

ERIN

-- who happens to know they poisoned people

and lied about it.

ERIN

And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not

only does it attack every organ of the body,

it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means

these people's genes, and the genes of their

kids, and the genes of their grandkids --

ED

I know how DNA works, Erin --

ERIN

We can get these people.  With a little

effort, I really think we can nail their

asses to the wall.

ED

Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise,

you believe that?

ERIN

Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit.

But I know the difference --

ERIN

-- BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG!

ED

Damn it.

ED

How many families we talking about here?

ERIN

Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.

ED

You think there's more?

ERIN

Well -- I found one document at the water

board that had a toxic test well reading

from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have

lived on that land since then.

ED

This is a whole different ball game, Erin.

A much bigger deal.

ERIN

Kinda like David and what's-his-name?

ED

Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole

fucking family.

(heavy sigh)

Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if,

you find me the evidence to back all this up

-- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.

ERIN

You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.

ED

Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm

filing for bankruptcy.

ERIN

Course, gathering evidence -- now, that's a

big job.  A hell of a lot bigger than just

filing.  I'm gonna be working a lot harder

now, taking on a lot more responsibility ...

ED

What now?

ERIN

Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all

the time I'm gonna be spending on the road,

I'll probably be needing my own cel phone,

won't I?

ERIN

You each can pick out four things.  But

nothing huge.  Look at the price.  Nothing

crazy.

GEORGE

You can buy 'em all the toys you want, but

come Monday, when you split again, they're

still gonna be pissed.

ERIN

George, I am just trying to do something

nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could

you please not give me a hard time about it?

GEORGE

One toy per kid is doing something nice.

Four is ... something else.

ERIN

Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh?

They're scarred for life.  They're gonna

start holding up 7-11's any day now.

GEORGE

I'm just saying --

ERIN

(with intensity)

I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna

hear it.  I am doing the best I can.

ERIN (O.S.)

Dr. Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich.  Tell me

something: if I wanna find as much evidence

of hexavalent chromium contamination as I

possibly can, what should I do?

FRANKEL (O.S.)

Well, what you have to remember is, if you

have hex chrom in the water, you have it in

anything that lived off the water.

FRANKEL (O.S.)

What I'd do is start a collection.  Anything

that existed in water, on water, under water

...

FRANKEL (O.S.)

anything that had water flow over or under

it ...

FRANKEL (O.S.)

anything that had water pass through it ...

FRANKEL (O.S.)

... collect 'em, label 'em, then bring 'em

to me.  I'll analyze 'em, see what we got.

BRENDA

For God's sake, Erin, I can see your

panties.

ERIN

Liar.  I'm not wearing any.

ERIN

Hello?

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Is this the Erin Pattee Brockovich that's

been snooping around the water board?

ERIN

Yes.  Who's this?

ERIN

I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone

call, George.

GEORGE

Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your

bills, not put you in danger.

ERIN

I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt.

Remember?

GEORGE

Look, don't take this the wrong way, but

don't you think you might be out of your

league here?

ERIN

No, see -- that's exactly what those

arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that

because they got all this money and power,

we don't stand a chance in hell against

them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.

GEORGE

It doesn't have to be this complicated,

Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.

ERIN

(off-hand)

How would you know?

GEORGE

You mind telling me what that's supposed to

mean?

ERIN

Nothing.

GEORGE

If you got a problem with me taking care of

your kids instead of getting some job, just

say so.

ERIN

I didn't say that.

GEORGE

Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can

start leaving the kids with the chicken fat

lady again.  Would that make you happy?

ERIN

Keep your voice down.

GEORGE

I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I

probably know it better than you.

ERIN

Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E

pay you to cover their ass, or do you just

do it out of the kindness of your heart?

ROSS

(a bad liar)

I don't know what you're talking about.

ERIN

The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee.

That heavy-breathing sicko that called the

other night could've only found out about me

from you.

(beat)

People are dying, Ross.  You got document

after document here, right under your nose,

that says why, and you haven't said word one

about it.  I wanna know how the hell you

sleep at night.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Hello?

ERIN

I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the

road.  Keep me awake, willya?

GEORGE

What do you want, a joke?

ERIN

No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me

about your day.  What went on back there?

GEORGE

Well, come to think of it, we did have a big

event around here.  Beth started talking.

ERIN

What?

(beat)

Beth?  My Beth?

GEORGE

Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and

she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."

GEORGE

I'd never seen that before -- someone's

first word.  Pretty intense.

ED

Is that what I think it is?

ERIN

She lived on the plume.  You never know.

ERIN

This was the community pool?

WOMAN 1

Yeah, that PG&E built.  The whole time we

thought it was algae that made it so green.

GEORGE

I'm bored, and so are the kids.

ERIN

Just a few more minutes, then we can go.

(as he heads off)

Take her, will you?

DONNA

Erin, this here's Frank Melendez.  He works

over at the compressor station --

ERIN

I'm sorry.  What were you saying?

ERIN

I need a ride.

ED

You wanna talk about --

ERIN

No

.

ERIN

What

, asshole?

MIKE AMBROSINO (O.S.)

Um, Erin?  This is Mike.  Ambrosino.

MIKE

She was about to take a handful of these --

MIKE

It's a morphine thing -- for pain --

LAURA

I'm embarrassed.

ERIN

That's okay.  I understand.

LAURA

It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting

worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be

a good mother.

ERIN

I'm real sorry, Laura.

LAURA

Know what I always thought I wanted outta

life, Erin?  A Jaguar.

ERIN

Jaguar's a darn pretty car.

LAURA

I thought if I could spend that kinda money

on a car, it'd mean everything else was

fine.

(beat)

I don't even know how much they cost.

ERIN

A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll

get one.

LAURA

Wouldn't mean the same thing.

ERIN

They used the hex chrom here, in these

cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then

they dumped it here, in these six ponds.

ED

I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.

ERIN

They covered 'em over.  And not too

carefully either, cause you dig one inch

under the surface, and the dirt is green as

a fucking shamrock.

ED

And that's what caused the contamination?

ERIN

It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's

on the bottom.

ERIN

See, according to this, they were supposed

to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep

into the ground.  But guess what --

ED

They skipped that step.

ERIN

I guess it was a little too inconvenient.

So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed

into the groundwater, free as you please.

ED

Jesus.

(beat)

I don't even wanna ask what you did to make

this Melendez guy talk.

ERIN

For your information, Frank cares what was

in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half

his day wading around them.  That was his

job.

ED

No shit.

ERIN

No --

ERIN

SHIT

!  SHIT!  Hot!  Hot!  Hot!

ERIN

You ...

asshole

...

ED

Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da

put three researchers on this, I wouldn't

expect them to dig up all the information

you got here.  This is some damn good work.

ERIN

Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.

ED

Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I

haven't billed a minute of my time since I

started on this case, so you can quit

hitting me up like I'm rich or something.

ERIN

Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty

rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got

those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.

ED

We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the

balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we

can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers

in San Francisco.

ERIN

What do you mean?

ED

PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way

of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.

ERIN

Oh, they knew.  They had to know.

ED

Show me the document that proves that.

ED

Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't

know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages.

And punitive damages is where the money is.

ERIN

Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I

work on this thing, the more I realize what

a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here

we got a company that poisoned a whole

aquifer -- that built a pool for a town,

then filled it with toxic water -- and

we're

the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving

things?  That's just not right.

ED

I like this case.

ERIN

Really?  It makes me sick.

ED

Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a

long time since I had a case I cared about.

ERIN

You didn't care about my case?

ED

I would now.

ED

Hey.  I like working with you.

ERIN

Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you

too.

ED

When'd you start calling me Ed?

GEORGE

I'm just saying -- we have one night to

ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?

ERIN

Cause it's my office party.  If you had an

office, I'd go to your party.

ERIN

And here, ta-daa, is my desk.

GEORGE

Which one?

(it's obvious)

Maybe they didn't think you were coming.

ERIN

(quietly)

God damn.  I work so hard.  The least they

could do ...

GEORGE

Hey.  Fuck 'em, babe.  Who needs 'em, huh?

GEORGE

(quietly)

See?  All we need is each other.

GEORGE

Good thing there isn't a present there, huh?

That mighta hurt.

ED

I'll show you what we did back here --

ERIN

That's Ed.

GEORGE

Lock the door.

ERIN

No, I wanna say hi.

GEORGE

We'll say hi later.  Lock it.

ERIN

Come on, George, it's a party.

JOEY

Your wife's real pretty.

GEORGE

She's not my wife.

GEORGE (O.S.)

It wouldn't kill you to talk about

something other than yourself and your own

fucking job once in a while --

ERIN (O.S.)

What do you want to talk about instead?

Your

day?  That's a fascinating subject.

GEORGE

Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day

trying to prove what hot shit I am --

ERIN

That is not what I'm --

GEORGE

Bull

shit

, Erin.  Bullshit.

ERIN

Great.  Excellent.  Thank you very much.

ERIN

It's okay, baby.  It'll be okay.

DONNA

I'd got so used to having 'em come up

benign, I guess I just didn't expect it.

DONNA

Sure wish I had longer to get used to the

idea.

(beat)

You think if you got no uterus, and no

breasts, you're still technically a woman?

ERIN

Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman,

cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads

and underwire.

DONNA

We're gonna get them, aren't we, Erin?  You

gotta promise me we're gonna get them.

ERIN

If they've sent that little shmuck Baum

again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.

ED

From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd

say they're taking us more seriously.

ERIN

Yeah, I heard that one before.

BRENDA

Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Webster, Mr. Buda, and Ms.

Cooper, from PG&E are here.

ERIN

Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.

ED

They're trying to intimidate us.

(then, to Brenda)

Tell them to wait in the conference room.

ED

Counselors --

MR. SANCHEZ

Counselors.

SANCHEZ

Let's be honest, here.  Two million dollars

is more money than these people have ever

dreamed of.

ERIN

Oh, see, now that pisses me off.  First of

all -- we got more'n a hundred plaintiffs.

They may not be sophisticated, but they do

know how to divide, and two million dollars

isn't shit when it's split between them.

ED

Erin --

ERIN

And second of all -- these people don't

dream about being rich.  They dream about

being able to watch their kids swim in a

pool without worrying they'll have to have a

hysterectomy at age 20, like Rosa Diaz -- a

client of ours -- or have their spine

deteriorate like Stan Bloom.  Another client

of ours.  So before you come back here with

another lame-ass offer, I want you to think

real hard about what your spine is worth,

Mr. Buda -- or what you'd expect someone to

pay you for your uterus, Miss Sanchez --

then you take out your calculator and

multiply that number by a hundred.  Anything

less than that is a waste of our time.

ANNA

Um, Erin?

(Erin turns)

Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily

my favorite person in the world ...

(beat)

... sometimes you're not half-bad.

ERIN

I'm gonna assume that was meant as a

compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.

ED

Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet

you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.

ERIN

D'you get his name?

(no answer)

Course not.  Jesus, Ed --

ED

He said he'd be at the gas station at six.

ERIN

Boy, this job takes me to some of the best

damn places, huh?

ERIN

This is the only station in town, right?

ATTENDANT

Yup.

ERIN

Someone's following me.

ED

What?  Who?

ERIN

Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was

alone, then he followed me, like, two miles.

Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.

ED

(to the counter guy)

Beer, please.

ED

What kind of truck?

ERIN

I don't know.  Big.  Dark.

ED

He's gone.

(back to the table)

Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?

ERIN

No, Ed -- what with me running for my life,

I didn't have time to check those things --

ED

I was just asking.  Are you all right?

ERIN

Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.

ED

Jesus, you look like shit.  When was the

last time you had a decent night's sleep?

ED

Don't worry.  I'm getting two rooms.

ED

Lock the door every which way you can.  And

if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever

-- pound on the wall.  I'll come right over.

ERIN

I think you should know -- there's very few

people in the world who don't piss me off 90

percent of the time.

(beat)

You're one of 'em.

ED

I'm triple locking my door, so don't even

think of trying to take advantage.

ERIN (O.S.)

Hello?

ERIN

What are you

doing

?  Where's George?

KATIE

I don't know.

ERIN

George!

ERIN

Jesus, George, they're turning the kitchen

into a hellhole.  You know you can't leave

them alone like that.

ERIN

What's going on?  What are you doing?

GEORGE

Thinking.

ERIN

About what?

GEORGE

About this.

ERIN

What's that?

GEORGE

It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the

mall one day, and I thought, damn, those

would look good on those beautiful earlobes.

So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next

time Erin says something nice, does

something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.

(beat)

Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In

six months, you haven't said one nice thing

to me.  That's a long time.

ERIN

I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --

GEORGE

I know.  But still.  Six months.

(he stands)

I think you oughta either find a different

job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there

may be men who don't mind being the maid and

getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as

shit not one of 'em.

ERIN

I can't leave my job, George.

GEORGE

Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People

do it all the time.

ERIN

I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best

thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it.

For the first time in my life, I got people

respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a

room and everyone shuts up just to hear what

I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever.

Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.

GEORGE

More than you need me.

ERIN

I need it.

GEORGE

Maybe you didn't like who you were before,

Erin, but I did.  That's who I fell in love

with.

ERIN

You already packed up your stuff?

GEORGE

I pretty much knew what your answer was

gonna be.

ERIN

Wait here.

ERIN

Where's my paycheck?

JANE

Have you been logging on?

ERIN

What?

JANE

I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only

knows to process paychecks for employees who

log on in the morning and off at night.

ERIN

(seething)

Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not

in here most mornings and nights?

JANE

You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of

something.

ERIN

I don't believe this --

ERIN

I want my fucking money --

ED

(into phone)

I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold

for just one second here --

(puts the call on

hold, then, to Erin)

Do you mind?

ERIN

(seething)

Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.

ED

Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the

problem is here, or --

ERIN

It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I

deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for.

That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.

ED

Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a

problem with Jane, work it out for yourself.

I don't have time to deal with --

ERIN

Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass

for you.  I watch everything else in my life

go straight in the toilet, for you.  And

what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the

way I'm treated around here -- but have you

ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever

mentioned to everyone what good work I'm

doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey,

Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has

the best tits; she gets paid the most cause

she's the best God damn employee I've ever

had?

ED

Is that what you want?

ERIN

I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.

ED

I'll see what I can do.

ERIN

You might want to think real hard about the

amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God

damn parking lot right now, cause I still

don't make enough to afford good child care.

Makes me think about looking around for a

job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.

MATTHEW

Can I play roller hockey?

ERIN

We'll see.

MATTHEW

When?

MATTHEW

Randy's mom said yes right away.

ERIN

(snapping)

Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom

doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's

dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's

gonna take who where is a little easier over

at Randy's house.

MESSENGER

Erin Brockovich?

ERIN

Yeah?

MESSENGER

Package from Masry & Vititoe.

ERIN

Believe it or not, I would've been satisfied

with just the check.

ED

Well, you go threatening to leave, I can't

take any chances.  You're the only person

around who understands what I'm doing.

Things come up, I gotta know I got someone

to turn to.

ERIN

What kind of things come up?

ED

Things like the head counsel for PG&E

calling me with an offer.

(beat)

20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it

or leave it.

ERIN

Whoa.  No shit.

ED

It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.

ERIN

So what are you thinking?

ED

I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to

make this decision.

(beat)

50 thousand bucks is more than any other

California toxic plaintiff has gotten.

Ever.  But ...

ERIN

... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's

medical bills.

ED

And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.

ERIN

Do you think we'd do better by going to

trial?

ED

Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have

anything linking this to PG&E corporate.

Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus,

we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to

bring on more lawyers ...

ERIN

Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot

of money.

ED

It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight

million dollars.

ERIN

That's a fucking fortune, Ed.  And you know

I'm the last person on Earth to walk away

from a big payday.  But you and me didn't

get into this to get rich.  We did it cause

we both have this voice in our heads saying,

do the right thing; get these plaintiffs

what they deserve -- the right to live and

die in some kind of comfort and peace.  If

50,000 isn't gonna buy that, then we gotta

say no.

(beat)

Trust me.  If you don't do the right thing

for these people, getting that 6 million

dollars is gonna feel like shit.

ED

I knew I put up with your bullshit for a

reason.

ED

This guy, Erin -- he's got more toxic tort

experience than anyone else in California.

He's huge.  And he said yes to me on the

first phone call, right off the bat.

(points to a building)

That's it.  The big one.  They've got the

top three floors.

ERIN

Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?

ED

Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor

and behave yourself for once.

(to receptionist)

Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

ERIN

Scuse me, sir, you got a real nice ass, you

know that?

ERIN

Oh, I'm sorry.  Was that not what you meant

by behaving myself?

THERESA

Ed.  Good to see you again.

ED

Theresa, hey -- this is Erin Brockovich.

THERESA

Kurt, Ed Masry's here.  And this is Erin

Brockovich, Ed's assistant.  Erin, this is

Kurt Potter.

POTTER

(to Ed, with a wink)

Well.  Now I know what you meant when you

called her your secret weapon.

POTTER

When'd they file the demur?

ED

Yesterday.

ERIN

What's a demur?

ED

It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't

have a case.  Their lawyers go --

POTTER

How many counts?

ED

Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all

of 'em.

ERIN

Counts?

ED

Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --

POTTER

Who's the judge?

ED

Corey.

POTTER

Good.

ERIN

Why good?

ED

He's got a reputation for doing all his --

POTTER

How long's he gonna take?

THERESA

You know what?  Why don't I take Erin down

the hall, so we can start in on this stuff?

ERIN

Hey -- those are my files --

THERESA

Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And

listen, good work.  They're a great start.

We're just going to have to spend a little

time filling in the holes in your research.

ERIN

Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no

holes in my research.

THERESA

No offense.  There are just some things we

need that you probably didn't know to ask.

ERIN

Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I

may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18

months on this case, and I know more about

those plaintiffs than you ever will.

THERESA

Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for

some of them.

ERIN

Whose number do you need?

THERESA

Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to

be able to contact the plaintiffs.

ERIN

I said,

whose number do you need

?

THERESA

You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs'

numbers by heart.

THERESA

Annabelle Daniels.

ERIN

Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.

ERIN

10 years old, 11 in May.  Lived on the plume

since birth.  Wanted to be a synchronized

swimmer, so she spent every minute she could

in the PG&E pool.  She had a tumor in her

brain stem detected last November, had an

operation on Thanksgiving, shrunk it with

radiation after that.  Her parents are Rita

and Ted.  Ted's got Chron's disease, and

Rita has chronic headaches and nausea and

underwent a hysterectomy last fall.  Ted

grew up in Hinkley.  His brother Robbie and

his wife May and their five kids Robbie,

Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose, and Peter lived on

the plume too.  Their number's 454-9445.

You want their diseases?

THERESA

Okay, look -- I think we got off on the

wrong foot here --

ERIN

That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet.

In fucking ugly shoes.

ERIN

She insulted me!

ED

Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But

instead of handling it politely, instead of

treating her with respect --

ERIN

Why the fuck should I respect her?

ED

Because

that's how people treat each other

!

ERIN

Not in my world.

ED

Gee, I wonder why.

ERIN

Hey!  You're my ride!

POTTER

I've also been thinking about the team.

Responsibilities, who should cover what --

ED

Right.

POTTER

I think we should makes some changes.

ERIN

I know she isn't real warm, but they say

she's a real good lawyer ...

TED

That may be.  But I don't want her coming to

the house again.  She's kinda stuck-up, and

she upsets Annabelle.  Now, I hate to say

this, but when she left today, Rita asked if

we should get a new lawyer.

ERIN

Ted, no -- don't do that.  If you don't like

Theresa, you don't have to work with her.

Me and Ed are still here for you.

TED

I called Ed two days ago, Erin, and he still

hasn't called me back.

BRENDA

Ed Masry's office ... Sorry, he can't be

interrupted.

ERIN

Don't be a pain in the ass, okay, Brenda?

Just put him on.

BRENDA

(with finality)

I said, he can't be interrupted.

ROSALIND

Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick

day.

ERIN

So did I.

ERIN

What's going on in there?

ROSALIND

Some meeting.  With PG&E people.

ERIN

PG& -- Are you sure?

ROSALIND

Yup.  They must be important, too, cause

they came on a special plane.

CORBIN

... we would enter into binding arbitration

-- judge, no jury -- with a settlement to be

between 50 and 400 million dollars.

POTTER

Any preconditions on the settlements?

CORBIN

The plaintiffs have to agree to it

unanimously.  And they're barred from ever

discussing their settlement with anyone.

ED

50-400 million dollars isn't a whole hell of

a lot of money for your company, Mr. Corbin.

HEAD COUNSEL

50-400 million dollars is a great deal of

money for your plaintiffs, Mr. Masry.

ED

Could I -- just take a brief break here for

a moment?  I'll be right back.

ERIN

If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your

fucking head off --

ED

Erin, it's just a meeting.

ERIN

People don't fly down in their own god damn

plane for "just a meeting" --

ED

Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I

thought you should rest.

ERIN

Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if

it suited you.

ED

Okay, look.  It's an important meeting.

Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --

ERIN

Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think

anymore?

ED

Look, this is serious now.  They're talking

serious money --

ERIN

And, what, I'm not serious?

ED

You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say

any God damn thing that comes into your

head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That

can be great; that can be a lot of fun --

ERIN

"Fun?"  Jesus, "

fun

?"  I kill myself for a

year and a half, hand you the best case of

your life on a God damn silver platter,

remind you of why you became a lawyer in the

first place, and you think of me as "fun?"

ED

Okay, now you're making this personal, and

it isn't --

ERIN

Not personal

?  That's my

work

in there, Ed.

My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not

personal, I don't know what is.

ERIN

(weakened)

How dare you take that away from me.

ED

No one's taking anything --

ERIN

Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating

to some God damn steno clerk so you could

finish this thing without me.  After all

I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.

ED

Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty.

You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of

perks ...

ERIN

Perks?  Jesus --

perks

?

ERIN

If this piece of shit is supposed to take

the place of your respect, you can take it

and shove it up your ass.

ERIN

Holy shit --

ERIN

Matthew --

ERIN

Matthew!

MATTHEW

!

ERIN

God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you

doing out here?

MATTHEW

I'm gonna go live with George.

ERIN

If you leave here real fast, I might not

kill you.

ERIN

We'll work out the roller hockey thing,

okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out.

I promise.

MATTHEW

You always say that.  Then you go to work

and forget you promised.

ERIN

I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard.

It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to

be able to organize things right and -- when

it comes to you guys, I end up falling

short.

MATTHEW

You never fall short for the work people.  I

guess maybe you just love them more.

ERIN

Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on

Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.

(beat)

I promise.

GEORGE

I'm looking for Erin Brockovich.  They

brought her in in an ambulance?

GEORGE

Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?

DOCTOR

It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and

part of the brain.

GEORGE

Jesus.

DOCTOR

She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a

pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been

walking around with it for a few weeks now.

GEORGE

How does someone get meningitis?

DOCTOR

Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to

bacteria or a virus or ...

GEORGE

... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?

GEORGE (O.S.)

They can stay at my place till you go home.

ERIN

They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just

wanna keep an eye on me another night.

GEORGE

Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.

ERIN

Thank you.

GEORGE

(giving nothing)

Mm-hm.

ERIN

George, hang on.

(he pauses)

Look ... I'm sorry.  I just --

GEORGE

I'll drop 'em by tomorrow.

ERIN

If you're here to fire me, your timing's

lousy.

ED

I'm not gonna fire you.

(beat)

I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and

that woulda made me look like a shit.

(serious)

You embarrassed me, Erin.

ERIN

I know.  I'm sorry.

(beat)

Do I get to hear what happened anyway?

ERIN

Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?

ED

Uh-huh.

ERIN

And if you had to guess ...

ED

With nothing linking it to the corporate

offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the

lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.

ERIN

So why would PG&E offer it?

ED

Because.  They know the evidence; they know

they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they

wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once

you factor in all they'd spend on this case

in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --

ERIN

Wait, what do you mean, ten years?

ED

Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that

for the appeal.

ERIN

(confused)

I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing

goes to trial, it'll be

ten years

before

these plaintiffs see their money?

ED

Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the

Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and

those people still haven't seen a dime.  So

in legal terms, ten years is --

ERIN

Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human

beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of

them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They

need their money now!

(beat)

We gotta get 'em to agree to the

arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn

one of those plaintiffs to --

ED

I know

.  We're having a meeting, it's all

set up --

ERIN

When?  Where?

ED

Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.

ERIN

Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to

tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --

ED

You're not gonna be there.

ERIN

The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the

doctor says --

ED

This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm

saying you can't come.

ERIN

Why not?

ED

Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you.

He thinks you're a loose cannon.

ERIN

Fuck Kurt.

ED

Erin --

ERIN

No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter

is?  He's the kind of guy who never would

have taken this case in the first place.

He's the kind of guy who would have sold

these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E

offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like

us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head

telling him to do the right thing.

ED

Don't come, Erin.  I mean it.  If you do,

I'm gonna have to fire you.

(beat)

Just ... concentrate on getting well.

ERIN

Come on, kids, we're going for a ride.

POTTER

Binding arbitration isn't all that different

from a trial.  It's overseen by a judge.

Evidence is presented in much the same way.

ERIN

Stay in the car, babies, I won't be long.

PLAINTIFF (O.S.)

And then a jury decides?

POTTER (O.S.)

No, sorry, I should have mentioned that.

There's no jury in binding arbitration.  No

jury, and no appeal.

BOB LINWOOD (O.S.)

No appeal?  So what are our options if we

don't like the result?

POTTER (O.S.)

Well -- you have none.  The judge's decision

is final.  But I really don't anticipate

that as a problem.

TOM BROWN

You don't even know what it's gonna be; how

do you know we're gonna like it?

POTTER

As I said before, it will

definitely

be

somewhere between 50 and 400 million

dollars.

MANDY BROWN

Which?  There's a big difference there.

POTTER

I wouldn't want to speculate at this point.

MANDY BROWN

Ed -- what do you think it'll be?

ED

I think ... Kurt's right.  We shouldn't

speculate.

MANDY BROWN

So then, what, that mystery number's divided

up at the whim of some judge --

POTTER

Judges don't make decisions based on whim,

ma'am.  They make them based on precedent

and evidence.

ERIN

Fucking idiot --

POTTER

Look.  Everyone.  Is this a big decision?

Absolutely.  But I do believe that if you

put a little faith in the system, you'll be

quite pleased with the outcome.

TED DANIELS

Mr. Potter, if you knew me from Adam, you'd

know that being pleased isn't an option for

me anymore.  Now don't take this personally,

sir, but I've never seen you before in my

life.  I'm not about to put my faith in

anything just cause you tell me to.

ERIN

Can I have one of those counter thingies,

please?

MATTHEW (O.S.)

I don't want to stay here.  It smells.

ERIN

We got no choice.  I'm not gonna make it

home tonight.  Now go wash up and climb into

bed.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Hello?

ERIN

Hi.  It's me.

(silence)

I got a favor to ask you.

GEORGE (O.S.)

I don't do favors for you anymore.

ERIN

It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're

the only one I trust them with.

ERIN

I got you your own room.

GEORGE

They up?

ERIN

Hunh-uh.  Not yet.

(awkward beat)

Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike,

okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.

GEORGE

How long's this whole thing gonna take?

ERIN

I don't know.  Few days.

(beat)

Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.

ERIN

And I miss you.

GEORGE

Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.

ERIN

I treated you real bad, George.  I know

that.  But, my problem was -- I never been

with anyone who deserved better than that.

You're the first nice guy who ever liked me.

ERIN

I just ... didn't know how to handle it.

That's all.

GEORGE

Think you could learn?

ERIN

(with a smile)

You know me.  I pick things up real fast.

GEORGE

You shouldn't be driving around, you know.

You're sick.

ERIN

Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of

these folks aren't.

DONNA

I don't know, Erin -- the way he was talking

to us, telling us everything was gonna be

fine -- I just didn't trust him.

PETE

And after all we been through -- no jury, no

appeal.  It just makes me nervous.

ERIN

I understand all that. And I don't wanna

force you into anything.  If you don't want

to sign, that's fine.  But why don't we talk

it over a little, cause I'd sure hate for

you to turn this down for the wrong reasons.

ERIN

You wouldn't happen to have a little time

right now, would you, Donna?

DONNA

For what?

ERIN

Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns

now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values

your opinion ...

RITA

I thought so, too, but Erin says a trial's

gonna take years

ERIN

What time is it?

GEORGE

Real early.  We're just gonna take your car

to get some breakfast.

ERIN

No, I need my car --

GEORGE

We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more

sleep.

GEORGE

C'mon, pal.  Leave that alone, we gotta go.

ERIN

Oh, baby, please don't play with that, okay?

I got 'em all organized.  Just put it back.

MATTHEW

This girl's the same age as me.

ERIN

That's right, sweetheart.

MATTHEW

She's one of the sick people?

ERIN

Yeah.  She is.

(beat)

But you know what?  That's why I'm helping

her.  So she can get some medicine to make

her feel better.

MATTHEW

How come her own mom isn't helping her?

ERIN

Cause her own mom's real sick, too.

MATTHEW

Maybe we'll bring you back some breakfast.

You want eggs?

ERIN

Eggs'd be great, baby.  Eggs'd be perfect.

ERIN

Hey, y'all.  How you all doing today?

ERIN

Mike!  I been looking all over for you.

Come here, I wanna talk to you.

ERIN (O.S.)

I'm gonna head out to Barstow and talk to

some folks out there tonight.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.

ERIN

I will.  Bye.

ERIN

Jesus!

ERIN

Okay, what're you gonna do?  You gonna kill

me?  Dump my body in a ditch somewhere?  Or

maybe you just wanna inject me with some

poison too -- why change tactics at this

stage of the game?

(beat)

Get outta my way, you make me sick.

DARK GLASSES

If PG&E made someone destroy a whole lot of

documents -- would that matter to you?

ERIN

Well ... I guess that depends on what the

documents were.

(she takes a beat)

I'm sorry -- I didn't get your name.

DARK GLASSES

Embry.  Charles Embry.

EMBRY

I was working in the compressor, and out of

nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the

office and says, we're gonna give you a

shredder machine, and send you on down to

the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of

all the documents stored out there.

ERIN

Did he say why?

EMBRY

Nope.  And I didn't ask.

ERIN

Did you get a look at the stuff you

destroyed?

EMBRY

Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding --

you gotta find some way to entertain your

mind.  So yeah, I took a look.

ERIN

And ...?

EMBRY

There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation

schedules, the like.

(beat)

But then there were a few memos about the

holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had

readings from test wells, stuff like that.

ERIN

And you were told to destroy those?

EMBRY

That's right.

EMBRY

Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good

employee.

ERIN

What do you mean?

EMBRY

Well.  There were a few documents that I

somehow didn't get around to shredding.

(beat)

That I kept instead.

ERIN

How come you didn't say anything when you

found these things?

EMBRY

At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some

of 'em want to go to college.  I can't

afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was

being honorable.

(beat)

But there's nothing honorable in what I did.

(beat)

Maybe that's why they picked me for the job.

Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.

ERIN

Hey, Ros, where are they?

ROSALIND

In the conference --

ERIN

Morning!

ED

Erin?  What are you --

ERIN

(ignoring Ed)

You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely

forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing

as how you've been so good to me, I think

that is a terrible oversight.  So what I

been doing over the last few days is I've

been putting together a present for you.

ERIN

635.  They all signed.  Every single one.

ED

Ho - ly - shit.

ERIN

Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a

little something for you, too.

ERIN

Internal PG&E documents, all about the

contamination.  The one I like best says,

and I'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes,

the water's poisonous, but it'd be better

for all involved if this matter wasn't

discussed with the neighbors.  It's to the

Hinkley station, from PG&E Headquarters.

Stamped received, March, 1966.

POTTER

Where did -- how did you do this?

ERIN

Well, what with me not having any brains or

legal expertise, I just went on up there and

performed sexual favors.  635 blow jobs in

five days.  Whew, am I ever tired.

ED

Hey!

ED

I don't know what to say.

ERIN

Say you were wrong.

ED

I was wrong.

ERIN

Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged

yourself.

ED

I did.  Both.

ERIN

Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on

Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.

ED

The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe,

Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in

history.

ED

But I know you're not gonna quit on me.

ERIN

How do you know that?

ED

(with a smile)

Cause you got a little voice in your head

saying, do the right thing.  Give him

another chance.

DISSOLVE TO:

ERIN

How you feeling today?

DONNA

It's a good day.  I feel good.

ERIN

Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it,

maybe we should talk shop.

ERIN

The judge came up with a number.

DONNA

A number for the whole group, or for us?

ERIN

Both.

ERIN

He's making them pay the maximum.

DONNA

Oh, my God.

ERIN

And he's making them give five million of it

to you all.

DONNA

Five million dollars?

ERIN

Five million dollars.

DONNA

I don't even know how much money that is.

ERIN

It's enough -- for whatever you need, for

whatever your girls need, for whatever your

girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.

DONNA

I can put them in a good school.

ERIN

Any school you want.

DONNA

And get someone to help around the house.

ERIN

Yup.

DONNA

Oh my God.  Oh my God.

DONNA

Oh, my God.

this

is where the hot lawyers work.  A gleaming testament

ROSALIND

Masry & Vititoe, can I -- shoot!

ERIN

Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?

ROSALIND

Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.

(into phone)

Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.

(calling out)

Does anyone know anything about these

phones?

ERIN

Careful you don't spit from here; you could

kill someone.

ED

You see your office?

ERIN

Yeah.  Yours is nicer.

ED

Oh, okay.  Here it comes.

ERIN

Here what comes?

ED

The extortion, the threats ...

ERIN

I wasn't gonna --

ED

"I can always find someplace else to work.

Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give

me a view of the French Riviera ..."

ERIN

Ed, I swear, I'm not --

ED

Okay, fine.

Fine

You backed me into a

corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...

ERIN

What is that?

ED

Take it.

ERIN

Two million dollars?

ED

The firm took in sixty.  That's three

percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.

ED

Oh, now I suppose you're gonna say it's not

enough.  Well, tough, Erin.  Too goddamn

bad.  Cause this is absolutely, positively

where I draw the line.

FADE OUT.

THE END
