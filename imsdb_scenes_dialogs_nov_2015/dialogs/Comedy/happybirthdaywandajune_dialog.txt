HAPPY BIRTHDAY, WANDA JUNE

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, WANDA JUNE

by

Kurt Vonnegut

ACT ONE

SCENE ONE

SILENCE.  Pitch blackness.  Animal eyes begin to glow in the

darkness.  Sounds of the jungle climax in animals fighting.

A SINGER is heard singing the first bars of "All God's

Chillun Got Shoes."  HAROLD, LOOSELEAF, PENELOPE, and WOODLY

stand in a row in the darkness, facing the audience.  They

are motionless.  A city skyline in the early evening

materializes outside the windows.

The lights come up on the living room of a rich man's

apartment, which is densely furnished with trophies of hunts

and wars.  There is a front door, a door to the master

bedroom suite, and a corridor leading to other bedrooms, the

kitchen and so on.

The lights are full.  SHUTTLE and WOODLY are bored with each

other, WOODLY looks out the window, speaks to an imaginary

listener who has more brains than SHUTTLE.  PAUL hates them

SCENE THREE

DARKNESS.  Lights come up on living room.  WOODLY is alone,

asleep on the couch.

HAROLD lets himself and LOOSELEAF in through the front

door--quietly.  HAROLD has a full beard and a paunch.

LOOSELEAF is skinnier.  He has a handlebar moustache.  Both

wear new sports clothes and smoke expensive cigars.  HAROLD

is calm.  LOOSELEAF is nervous, confused.  They prowl the

room cautiously, checking this and that.  HAROLD awakens

WOODLY by playing with his feet.

WOODLY

(startled)

HAROLD

(to LOOSELEAF, very amused)

WOODLY

patience, blurting)

HAROLD

(delighted)

WOODLY

He turns out the overhead light.

HAROLD

WOODLY

(holding open the

front door)

HAROLD

All three exit.  A moment later, HAROLD lets himself and

LOOSELEAF in again with a key.  He turns on the light again,

roams the room, reacquainting himself with his beloved

trophies.  LOOSELEAF is jangled by the adventure.  HAROLD

chucks a lioness under her chin.

HAROLD

HAROLD, who wants to savor the early moments of his

homecoming alone, now tries to get the very jumpy LOOSELEAF

out of the apartment.

LOOSELEAF is still present.

a broadsword,

admiring its balance

and strength)

HAROLD does not respond.

He exits.

HAROLD

(pleased with the room)

(sees the cake)

Blackout.

SCENE FOUR

MUSIC indicates happiness, innocence, and weightlessness.

Spotlight comes up on WANDA JUNE, a lisping eight-year-old

in a starched party dress.  She is as cute as Shirley Temple.

WANDA JUNE

Spotlight begins to dim and carnival music on a steam

calliope begins to intrude, until, at the end of the speech,

WANDA JUNE is drowned out and the stage is black.

WANDA JUNE

Sudden silence.

WOODY WOODPECKER VOICE

(pistol shot)

Silence.

Spotlight comes up on LOOSELEAF HARPER, who wears the

clothes he will wear in the next scene--new sports clothes,

a shirt open at the neck.  As always, he is friendly and

embarrassed.

LOOSELEAF

(laughs idiotically)

(silence)

Blackout.

SCENE FIVE

SPOTLIGHT comes up on HAROLD.  He sits on the front seat of

an imaginary car.  The seat is covered with zebra skin.

HAROLD

He pantomimes turning the ignition key.  The sound of a

starter and a powerful engine responds.  He pantomimes

putting the car in gear and driving away from the curb.

Appropriate sounds are heard.

HAROLD

Spotlight comes up on PENELOPE, who wears a skimpy carhop

outfit she has had on under her coat in the previous scene.

HAROLD

PENELOPE

HAROLD pantomimes swerving into Hamburger Heaven.  Tires

squeal.  He pantomimes a stop, kills the engine.  He blows

his imaginary horn.  A real horn blows the bugle call for

"charge." PENELOPE crosses to HAROLD.

SCENE SEVEN

SILENCE.  Pitch blackness.  The sounds of a Nazi rally come

up slowly: "Sieg Heil!  Sieg Heil!  Sieg Heil!"  Spotlight

comes up on MAJOR SIEGFRIED VON KONIGSWALD, and officer in

the dreaded SS.  He is in full ceremonial uniform.  The

sounds fade.

HAROLD                         PAUL

Son, son, son...               Father, father, father...

They part, unsatisfied and confused.  HAROLD goes to

PENELOPE, his arms outstretched.

HAROLD

PENELOPE struggles to her feet, her face blank.  HAROLD

embraces her, finds himself wrestling with a rigid,

unresponsive object.

HAROLD

HAROLD lets go, backs away from her.

PENELOPE

She crosses to the door of the master bedroom, kissing each

She exits into bedroom, closes the door firmly, locks it

audibly.

WOODLY

(dazedly)

HAROLD

WOODLY

HAROLD

WOODLY

(crushed, without any

possible comeback)

He exits through the front door.  HAROLD goes at once to

PENELOPE's door, tries it, finds it locked.

turns away.

The bedroom door opens, revealing PENELOPE.

world at large)

She closes the door and locks it.

HAROLD

Blackout.

ACT TWO

SCENE ONE

DARKNESS.  PAUL, alone in the living room, hammers on his

mother's door.  He wears pajamas.

PAUL

Toilet flushes.  Lights come up on the living room.  It is

morning.

PAUL

HAROLD

(a moment of exhaustion)

PAUL

Door to the master bedroom suite opens.  PENELOPE appears in

the doorway.  She has decided during an almost sleepless

night that she owes it to PAUL and to her own self-respect

to explore the possibility of beginning her life with HAROLD

anew.  She is terrified of him.  She hopes that if she can

keep calm and open, her fears will diminish.  Perhaps she

can love him again.

PENELOPE

mechanically as a

good wife should)

PENELOPE

PAUL

He exits through front door, leaves door open.  We hear him

knocking on a door in the hallway.

PAUL

HAROLD enters, drained but recovering.  He chews on a root.

He has slept in the shirt and trousers he wore the night

before.  He is barefoot.  PAUL knocks again.

PAUL

There is the sound of WOODLY's door opening.  WOODLY and

PAUL speak unintelligibly, WOODLY evidently inviting PAUL in

for a moment.  WOODLY's door closes.

WOODLY and PAUL enter.  WOODLY is correctly professional and

carries a little black bag.

away, having been

nearly hypnotized)

HAROLD

He realizes at once that his violent side has severely

damaged the side of him which is the great seducer.

PENELOPE and PAUL are straight as ramrods.

HAROLD

Lion doorbell roars.

LOOSELEAF starts to laugh.  HAROLD shuts him up.

HAROLD

LOOSELEAF

PENELOPE enters from the kitchen with a question on her lips.

HAROLD

PENELOPE

HAROLD

(turning to LOOSELEAF crassly)

(to PENELOPE)

PENELOPE exits dumbly, detesting the word "scrog," which she

has never heard before.

LOOSELEAF starts to laugh again, stops the laugh as HAROLD

glowers.

MILDRED enters drunkenly up aisle, sits precariously on

apron of stage and speaks to audience.

MILDRED

She exits clumsily, the way she came.  Silence.  Lights come

up on the living room, which has become a pigpen.  LOOSELEAF,

HAROLD, SHUTTLE and PAUL sit around a dinner of nearly raw

beefsteak set on the coffee table.  LOOSELEAF wears an ill-

fitting uniform, which he has rented.

the futility of such

long-term expectations)

He spots the vacuum cleaner, probes it with his toe, asks

SHUTTLE with seriousness.

HAROLD

SHUTTLE starts to answer, but stops, supposing that he is

being made sport of.

PENELOPE

HAROLD is about to dismiss this request majestically, but

PENELOPE cuts him off with a sharp, dangerous warning.

PENELOPE

HAROLD experiments inwardly with responses of various kinds,

obviously saying them to himself, directing himself with his

hands.  Nothing quite satisfies him.

HAROLD

liking to fail in any way)

HAROLD exits into corridor.  WOODLY looks after him

helplessly, apprehensively.  Silence.

WOODLY

VON KONIGSWALD, MILDRED, and WANDA JUNE enter from the side

stealthily.  VON KONIGSWALD, pantomimes that his companions

are to be quiet and to listen for something wonderful.  All

ghosts cup their hands to their ears.

WOODLY

There is a shot offstage.  VON KONIGSWALD is delighted.

MILDRED is sickened.  WANDA JUNE is dazed.  WOODLY collapses

in grief.  HAROLD enters from the corridor, shaking his head.

HAROLD

VON KONIGSWALD expresses disappointment.  MILDRED covers her

face.  WANDA JUNE sucks her thumb.

HAROLD

Curtain.
