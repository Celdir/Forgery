THE HEBREW HAMMER

GENTILE BOY 1

Hey Mordechai, look. I dropped a penny.

GENTILE GIRL 1

Hey Mordechai. Want a bagel?

GENTILE BOY 2

Hey Jew nose, save some oxygen for us.

GENTILE GIRL 2

Hey Morty, my mom says that unless your

people wise up and accept Jesus Christ as

your lord and savior you're all going to

burn in hell.

GENTILE BOY 1

Hey everybody! Look what Mordechai got.

Nice spinning top Morty.

MRS. HIGHSMITH

Now, now class let's not make fun of

Mordechai's spinning top. We need to all

learn the importance of tolerance and

understanding. Isn't that right

Mordechai?

MORDECHAI

Yes Mrs. Highsmith.

MRS. HIGHSMITH

So class, in honor of Mordechai's special

day, I'd like for all of us to wish Morty

a heartfelt Merry...

MRS. HIGHSMITH (CONT'D)

(Stumbling)

Cha-noo-kuh Day 7.

MRS. HIGHSMITH (CONT'D)

Very good class. I hope you've all

learned an important lesson today. Just

because Mordechai's people are different

from us...just because they might appear

strange to us with their furry hats,

their beady eyes, and their long

sideburns...not to mention their bizarre

customs and unnecessarily guttural, funny

sounding names...just because they

control all of the worlds' money, yet are

too cheap to buy their children anything

better than spinning tops for presents,

does not mean that we can't learn to

respect and love them as our equals.

MRS. HIGHSMITH (CONT'D)

Happy Chanoo-juah-kah Day 7 Morty.

Happy Hanukkah Maccabee.

MACCABEE (O.C.)

Thanks Hammer!

OLD WOMAN

Hammer, why don't you come eat by us for

Shabat. My Miriam is all grown up now.

God willing, you should settle down and

marry.

HAMMER

Thanks for the invite Mrs. Kleinman, but

right now G dash d's the only one for me.

OLD WOMAN

I can dig it.

OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)

Hammer, you're the baaddest Hebe this

side of Tel Aviv.

HAMMER

(To himself)

Shabat Shalom!

He walks off frame.

SHLOMO

Give it back! Give me back my yarmulke!

TEENAGE GENTILE

Hey Teddy, throw me the frisbee.

TEENAGE GENTILE (CONT'D)

We...we were going to give it back. I

swear to god.

HAMMER

Did you just take god's name in vain?

TEENAGE GENTILE

No, no. It...It's not like that. We were

just about...

HAMMER

Just about to leave, right?

TEENAGE GENTILE

Yeah, yeah, that's right. We were just

about to leave. C'mon Teddy.

HAMMER

You alright?

SHLOMO

I guess. Sometimes I wonder why I even

bother praying to one god.

HAMMER

Hey, hey! Be proud of who you are. You're

a bad, bold, big-nosed, biblical brother.

You feelin' me?

SHLOMO

Yeah. You're right.

HAMMER

Aveenooh Shalom Alechem little brother.

SHLOMO

Thanks Hammer.

HAMMER

Stay Jewish.

HAMMER

Happy Hanukkah Tikva.

TIKVA

Happy Hanukkah Morty.

HAMMER

So, what's shakin' Yenta.

TIKVA

Well, for stahters, your mother called.

She said to remind you that you're having

Shabat Dinner by her tomorrow, and also

to remind you to bring the Manischewitz,

and she wanted me to relate the following

information to you.

HAMMER

Okay, what's the information?

TIKVA

She said to remind you that you're having

Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to

remind you to bring the Manischewitz.

HAMMER

Anything else?

TIKVA

Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office

from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a

terrible yeast infection and I need to

see my gynecologist.

HAMMER

But we're not open on Sundays.

TIKVA

I understand that. I just thought that

you might want to know.

HAMMER

(Beat)

I'll be in my office.

YET TBD TRANSITION TO:

SANTA CLAUS (O.S.)

I want to start by thanking all of you

for pulling yourselves away from the

workshop to make this emergency meeting.

I know it's the busiest time of the year

for all of you, so I'll try and be brief.

SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)

My father, often referred to as St. Nick

The Nasty, was a tyrannical man. He was

obsessed with making Christmas the only

holiday anyone could celebrate before the

New Year.

Since his death, I've prided myself on

ensuring that the Christmas season is one

of tolerance and understanding between

all races and religions. It's always been

my belief that Hanukkah and Kwanzaa

deserve the same respect as Christmas.

SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)

Lights please.

SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)

Over the course of my career as Santa

Claus, I've made it my mission to ensure

that Jews, Christians, and African

Americans could all observe their

respective holidays in harmony.

SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)

I was responsible for pushing the Happy

Holidays Ordinance, in which all Merry

Christmas signage was replaced by the

Trans-relgious and inoffensive phrase

'Happy Holidays.'

SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)

It was nearly a decade ago, in

conjunction with our friends in the

Jewish and African American communities

that I supported a bill that mandated

that 'Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel' and 'I'm

dreaming of a bright Kwanzaa' be taught

and sung in elementary schools along with

the Christmas standards 'Frosty The

Snowman', and 'Deck The Halls.'

Which is why upon examination of my

annual naughty and nice list it shocked

me to discover that my own son, Damian...

SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)

The heir to the Red Suit could be so

filled with hate.

SANTA CLAUS (CONT'D)

Damian, when I learned of your ludicrous

scheme to wipe out Hanukkah, my first

reaction was one of disgust. Now, I'm

only filled with sadness and

disappointment. Disappointed that I

failed to teach you the true meaning of

Christmas. What do you have to say for

yourself?

DAMIAN

Ho. Ho. Ho.

SANTA CLAUS

Et tu, Blitzen?

SANTA

What are you fucking midgets looking at!?

Get back to work! We have Hanukkah to

destroy!

STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO:

HALL

Hey!

CHIEF

The time for action is now. We predict

that the St. Nick Day Massacre will put

Hanukkah-Christmas relations back at

least a hundred years. With this

meshuggena new Santa Claus in power,

Hanukkah is in jeopardy. Our first order

of business is to put into motion a plan

to create goodwill towards the Jewish

Community. Mr. Chairman of the Worldwide

Jewish Media Conspiracy.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN

Yes Chief.

CHIEF

We need your people to crank out a couple

more award winning documentaries on the

Holocaust, possibly a new Adam Sandler

movie.

ADL CHAIRMAN

Not another Adam Sandler movie!

HARVEY WEINSTEIN

What's wrong with Adam Sandler movies?

ADL CHAIRMAN

We're trying to create goodwill here. I

just think...

HARVEY WEINSTEIN

Frankly, I don't care what you think. I

think you're a putz.

ADL CHAIRMAN

(Beat)

Don't defame me. I'm against that.

CHIEF

Focus people. Our next order of business

is to assign an agent to track Santa's

activities. Step in and use force if the

situation calls for it.

We need to put the toughest Jew we have

on the case. Suggestions? Suggestions,

anybody?

JDL MEMBER 1

What about Steven Spielberg?

CHIEF

C'mon, he made ET. We need someone tough

people.

JDL MEMBER 2

What about Itzahk Perlman?

CHIEF

He's in a wheelchair for crying out loud.

JDL MEMBER'S 3 AND 4 (O.S.)

Allen Greenspan? Henry Kissinger?

CHIEF

Too old.

ADL CHAIRMAN

Joe Lieberman?

CHIEF

Missing in action.

JDL MEMBER 1

Robert Shapiro?

CHIEF

He's a lawyer. We're looking for heros

people.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN

David Copperfield?

CHIEF

What's he gonna do, make Santa disappear?

Think people think. We need a hard

hittin' Hebe on this one.

ESTHER

What about Mordechai Jefferson Carver?

CHIEF

The Hebrew Hammer? No. No way. After the

way he handled that situation in the West

Bank? He's the only Jew in the world too

extreme for the JDL. There's a reason why

we kicked him out of our ranks,

sweetheart. We need a man who can follow

orders. A man with self-control. We need

a man...

COUNCIL ELDER

...We need a man who can get the job

done.

ESTHER

Daddy, he's our only hope. And you know

it.

ADL CHAIRMAN

Only problem is, ever since we kicked him

out, he wants nothing to do with us.

There's no way we can persuade him to

come back.

ESTHER

Perhaps I can persuade him.

STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO:

HAMMER (V.O.)

It was the day before Hanukkah when she

strolled into my office.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Come in.

ESTHER

Mr. Jefferson Carver?

HAMMER

Please, call me Mordechai.

HAMMER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

From the way she carried herself I could

tell she'd been around the block a few

times...

ESTHER

Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and

I've been circling the block for the past

half hour looking for parking. What are

you listening to?

HAMMER (V.O.)

Oh, the things I would do to her if I had

the...

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Client notes. Sorry.

(Beat)

What can I do for you?

ESTHER

My name is Esther. Chief

Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish

Defense League desperately needs to speak

with you.

HAMMER

How is old Chief

Bloomenbergensteinenthal?

Is he still shtooping every girl he can

get his hands on?

ESTHER

(Annoyed)

Actually, his days of marital infidelity

have long since past. Now he just shtoops

my mother exclusively.

HAMMER

Your mother? Oh. Whoops.

ESTHER

Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed

out by his son Damian. The man's a demon.

There's no telling what this new anti

semitic psycho Santa is capable of.

HAMMER

I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a

good friend, but my days...

BLONDE BOMBSHELL

Mr. Hammer? I'd like to hire you to put a

tail on my husband. I think my life might

be in danger. I think he wants to kill

me.

HAMMER

Sorry Shiksa, I think you got the wrong

office. I'm the Hebrew Hammer. Mike

Hammer's down the hall.

BLONDE BOMBSHELL

Oh.

HAMMER

Listen. Esther, you seem like a nice

girl, so I'm only gonna say this once. I

no longer affiliate myself with that

organization. The politics there were

brutal. Besides, I've already got a full

case load.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

That's...uh...that's all done

electronically now.

ESTHER

Why are you being so difficult? All my

father wants is to just speak with...

HAMMER

I hate to cut you short, but in an hour

the sun goes down, and then it's

officially the Sabbath. I can't work on

the Sabbath. This is where we're going to

have to part ways boobola.

ESTHER

I'm not leaving your side until I get you

to agree to come speak with my father.

HAMMER

Be my guest. But I have to warn you, I'm

going to my mother's for dinner tonight.

And if you think I'm difficult, wait till

you meet her.

ESTHER

(Solemnly)

Before we leave, there's just one more

thing. I noticed that the sign on your

door says you're a certified circumcised

dick. Would you mind if I asked to see

your credentials?

CUT TO:

MRS. CARVER

Mordechai! Shabat Shalom!

HAMMER

Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some

Manischewitz. The black label.

MRS. CARVER

I can see. And you also brought a nice

girl to come eat by us.

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

So. Do you have a name?

ESTHER

It's Esther.

MRS. CARVER

(She sighs ferclempt)

From the story of Purim.

(To Hammer)

Well, now that we're all acquainted,

let's sit down and start the Sabbath.

CUT TO:

HAMMER

Oy vey, I'm stuffed.

ESTHER

I don't think I could eat another latke

if you paid me.

MRS. CARVER

Everybody ready for the main course?

HAMMER

Mom, I think we've had enough.

MRS. CARVER

(Hysterically)

Nonsense young man. You'll eat everything

in front of you. After all, there are

people starving in China. Isn't that

right Mun Chi?

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

Not until Mordechai finishes everything

in front of him.

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

Mordechai!?

(Beat)

So, Esther, how did you and Mordechai

meet. You know they call him the Hebrew

Hammer for a reason.

HAMMER

Mom! Esther works for the JDL. They sent

her to try and recruit me back to save

Hanukkah for them. What she doesn't seem

to understand is that nothing, not even

god himself could convince me to ever

work for them again.

ESTHER

But Hanukkah's in dan...

HAMMER

Not my problem. If you'll excuse me now,

I need to use the bathroom.

MRS. CARVER

You like my Mordechai, yes?

ESTHER

He's...he's very nice.

(Desperately)

But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah

rests solely in his hands. Please, you

have to help me.

MRS. CARVER

Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one

of the high holidays. What concerns me

more is that my boychick is almost

thirty, and has yet to settle down with a

nice Jewish girl.

(Beat)

I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with

your little Hanukkah problem if you help

me with my Mordechai.

ESTHER

(Confused)

What do you want me to do?

MRS. CARVER

He works too much. God forbid he should

have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him

once in a while. Take his mind off his

work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

Is this something you could do for me?

HAMMER

Mom, where do you keep the plunger?

MRS. CARVER

(Yells)

It's under the sink by my tampons!

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

So, do we have a deal?

ESTHER

Deal.

HAMMER

So, what did you two ladies discuss while

I was gone.

MRS. CARVER

I was just telling your nice friend

Esther about how I used to have such a

problem with the gas.

(To Esther)

So, once I started taking two charcoal

pills before I ate, the gas cleared

itself right up.

ESTHER

Thanks. That's...good to know.

MRS. CARVER

Mordechai. Do you love your mother?

HAMMER

Mom, stop with this already. Of course I

love you. You're my mother.

MRS. CARVER

Then how come you won't stop this

Certified Circumcised Dick nonsense and

get yourself a real job.

HAMMER

Mom, I have a real job. I do good things

for this community. I help people.

MRS. CARVER

When I play bridge with all the girls,

everyone has what to talk about with

their sons. They show pictures. Their

sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis.

Why can't I show a picture?

HAMMER

(Angered)

So don't show a picture.

MRS. CARVER

You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the

investment banker? He paid for her entire

retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he

is. Instead of schleping to save

Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back

to business school and get an MBA. Maybe

then you could send me to Boca, too.

HAMMER

Oh. Oh, What. So, all of a sudden my

saving Hanukkah's not good enough for

you? Is that what your saying?

MRS. CARVER

I don't want to argue with you. Let's

just eat in peace.

HAMMER

No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know

what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just

to spite you. And when my face is all

over the television. When your friends

are opening their Hanukkah gifts next

year, don't mention it to them, okay? I

wouldn't want you to have to show my

picture.

MRS. CARVER

Do what you must.

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

(To Esther)

Such a good boy he is.

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

Mazel Tov!

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

What's that Mazel Tov? Your diaper needs

changing?

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

(To Mazel Tov)

Let's let your tuchus breathe.

HAMMER

Mom, why don't you put that cat out of

its misery?

MRS. CARVER

(Extremely offended)

Because it isn't god's way.

When you spent the fourth grade in bed

recovering from your bout with

hypoglycemia, did I put you down? No.

Mazel Tov will lead a full life just like

the rest of us. Isn't that right Mazel

Tov?

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

Anybody hungry for desert?

come here. I shlep all the way out to the

middle of nowhere, for lord knows what

purpose, and...

HAMMER (CONT'D)

I am so unhappy with this situation. Why

Mordechai? Why do you always feel it

necessary to do what other people want

you to do? Why can't you be your own

man...

He's still got it.

Welcome back Hammer.

CHIEF

Since you've been gone Hammer, some

things have changed around here. Our

agents are now subjected to a strict

physical training regiment. Take a look.

HAMMER

A minion practicing Jew-do, the deadly

fighting art. Cool.

CHIEF

There's more. Follow me.

CHIEF (CONT'D)

We've even relaxed our centuries old

admissions criteria.

CHIEF (CONT'D)

Mordechai Jefferson Carver, I'd like for

you to meet the Jewish Defense League's

first black Jewish agent. A close

personal friend of mine, agent Sammy

Davis Jr. Jr.

SAMMY DAVIS JR. JR.

The Hebrew Hammer? I've heard about this

cat. Your beautiful babe. Keep on keeping

on.

HAMMER

Alright. I'll, uh, keep doing that.

CHIEF

Sammy, if you'll excuse us, Mordechai and

I have business to attend to.

SAMMY DAVIS JR. JR.

You two cats keeps purrin'.

CHIEF

Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I

just want to say that I'm not happy about

this. I don't want a repeat of that

incident in the West Bank.

HAMMER

I got the job done didn't I? I did what I

had to do.

CHIEF

A settlement completely demolished, ten

smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G

dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're

above the Ten Commandments? Just find

Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No

heroics, got it?

HAMMER

(Smirks)

Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just

readin' the Torah portion.

CHIEF

Well it's good to see that you can be so

nonchalant about the whole thing.

HAMMER

(Thinking)

I guess I could be chalant about it, but

then again I'm not even sure if that's a

word. Listen Chief, we could stand around

arguing all day, but I gotta case to

crack.

CHIEF

What's your first move?

HAMMER

I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See

if they've got the 411 on Santa's

location. I'll check in with you when I

know more.

CHIEF

You be careful Hammer.

CHIEF (CONT'D)

The fate of Hanukkah rests squarely on

your shoulders.

HAMMER

Okay. You guys have seriously got to stop

with that stuff. That's a lot of pressure

to put on one Jew. I'm only human you

know. I'm already shvitzing about the

whole thing. You know, believe it or not,

I'm allowed to make mistakes, too. I can

only do the best that I can do, and

that's just gonna have to be good enough

for all of you.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Just...just stop with that. Okay?

Alright, I'm out of here.

you know what I mean.

Actually, I...I don't. What does that

Is there anything else you can tell me?

His hangouts, his next move, anything?

JAMAL

Well, come to think of it, there is one

thing. Before I left, I was packin' up my

shit and I overheard the nigga talkin' to

some business pahtnah or something. Sayin

that he'd meet him today at some joint

called Duke's. Round five o'clock if my

memory serves. When he got off the phone

and jetted, I scoped the room for some

jewelry, cash, whatevers. You know, a

severance package. Didn't find any

duckets, but I did snatch this.

HAMMER

Thanks little brother, you've been a big

help.

JAMAL

Shit fool, ain't no thang. If it wasn't

for my real brothers here at the K.L.F.,

I'd be shining shoes at the train station

or getting my afro tossed up against a

velcro wall in some redneck bar

somewhere. I finally gots a place where I

belong. Fuck Christmas. I'm all about

smoking blunts and pimpin' bitches. I'm

all about Kwanzaa nigga!

He's new. He's still got a long way to go

before he understands the true meaning of

Kwanzaa.

HAMMER

Thanks again Mo, you always deliver the

goods.

MOHAMMED

You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah

might just be his first move. For all we

know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot

of brothers counting on you. If you

fail...

HAMMER

Okay, look. I'm going to work really,

really hard on this one. But, please stop

with the pressure. I'm already tense as

it is.

Utopian model of efficiency my ass! Ever

We know our rights Santa! You're in

violation of the union regulations! We're

going on strike!

SANTA

You know something, you're right.

HEAD ELF

Really?

SANTA

Yeah. This is a sweatshop. And since you

elves aren't willing to do the work, I

made arrangements to have some Taiwanese

children shipped over. And I might add,

they're more than willing to work for

peanuts.

Come on in boys!

So, what's our first plan of attack

Santa?

While I was in Taiwan negotiating the

solution to our labor problems, I came

manufactures the most addictive, Jewish

pride weakening substance on the planet.

I bought the entire plant.

is a fistful of Shekels.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Shabat Shalom, motherfuckers.

HAMMER

Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need

for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy

to mass produce video copies of every

Hollywood movie ever made featuring a

positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.

CHIEF

You mean you want us to make copies of

Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim

Potok's The Chosen?

HAMMER

That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish

community stat. We got an epidemic on our

hands.

CHIEF

We're on it Hammer. How'd you do with

Santa?

HAMMER

It was a trap. I'm back at square one.

CHIEF

Well, then I've got good news for you. We

just got word that he'll be making an

appearance at the Mall Of America today.

I'm sending Esther to meet you there at

once.

HAMMER

Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves

as a Gentile couple to pass undetected.

Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should

be a piece of homentashen.

CHIEF

One last thing Hammer. You take care of

yourself. The...

HAMMER

The fate of Hanukkah. Right. Right. Yeah,

Got it. Will do. Okay, bye now.

TONY

Nothing stirring here.

BLONDE GENTILE GIRL

Can I be next? Please, please!

TONY

Let's get a look at you, shall we.

TONY (CONT'D)

A power muff girls T. Very nice.

Alright, now spin around.

TONY (CONT'D)

Very nice! Alright. You're cool. Go on

and see Santa, sunshine.

FRECKLE FACED GENTILE BOY

That's not fair! How come she gets to go

next? We were here first!

TONY

Oh really! Is that a fact? Well guess

what buddy? You ain't gettin' in to see

Santa today, so why don't you just turn

around and high tail it home.

FRECKLE FACED GENTILE BOY

But I've been waiting to see Santa all

year.

TONY

But I've been waiting to see Santa all

year.

TONY (CONT'D)

You heard me. Get moving punk!

CUT TO:

ESTHER

Any sign of Santa?

HAMMER

He must be behind that curtain. Relax.

We're undercover. We need to give off the

appearance of calm. You see Esther, the

trick to undercover work is to try and

blend in. Act as a Gentile would.

SAMPLES WOMAN

Could I interest you in a free sample

bacon cheeseburger?

HAMMER

While I thank you, Gentile friend, for

your generous offer of that deliciously

unkosher snack, I sadly have to decline

for I stuffed myself full of meat and

milk product at a prior lunch engagement.

ESTHER

You're good.

TONY

Can I have everyone's attention please.

In fifteen minutes, Santa's gonna have to

leave.

TONY (CONT'D)

Ah, don't be like that kids. We gotta lot

work to do if we're gonna get all those

presents out in time.

TONY (CONT'D)

Hey! Hey! You want shitty ass presents

for Christmas? You want Barbies with

heads screwed on backwards? You want

remote control cars without the batteries

included. Then be my fucking guest!

ESTHER

What are we going to do? We're at least

an hour from the front.

HAMMER

C'mon follow me.

ESTHER

(To Hammer)

Is that...? No, couldn't be.

TONY

Hey, hey! Not so fast.

HAMMER

We have to get through. It's an

emergency.

TONY

Sorry pal, you're gonna have to wait in

line just like all the other parents.

ESTHER

We're so sorry to have to cut, but our

beautiful Gentile boy ran on ahead of us

in line.

ESTHER (CONT'D)

It would mean so much to Paul and I if

you'd let us through to see Santa.

TONY

Well...umm, when you put it that way.

Sure go on through.

HAMMER

You're good!

CUT TO:

SANTA

And what do the Jewish people do during

Hanukkah?

JIMMY

They worship the devil and sacrifice

small Gentile children like me in

bizarre, sadistic rituals.

SANTA

That's right. Santa can tell that you've

been a very good boy this year. Run along

now Jimmy.

SANTA (CONT'D)

Sorry folks, I don't do couples.

HAMMER

If you keep your mouth shut and come with

me, you won't get hurt.

SANTA

Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a

look around you. Do you even know who I

am?

HAMMER

Let me guess, you're the goy who stole

Hanukkah.

SANTA

The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.

HAMMER

What's your shpiel, Santa?

SANTA

Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is

this any way to treat an old family

friend? Let's cut out all the

unpleasantness. I admit, I went way

overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing.

Let me make it up to you. How about a

peace offering?

(To Bambi and Tawni)

Girls.

SANTA (CONT'D)

Bambi. Tawni. I'd like for you to meet

world renown Semitic super stud,

Mordechai Jefferson Carver.

BAMBI

Oh, I declare I just love Jewish men.

They're so sensitive and well read.

HAMMER

Sorry Santa. I like my women like my

matzah. Unleavened.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

This is where you go down.

TONY

Hey, hurry it up in there. We gotta bunch

of kids...

TONY (CONT'D)

Oh shit!

ESTHER

Back it up buddy!

MC HAMMER

Please Hammer, don't hurt em'!

HAMMER

Let's do this clean. I don't want to make

a scene Santa.

SANTA

Well, it's a bit too late for that now,

isn't it? Excuse me children, if I could

have your attention for a moment.

HAMMER

What are you doing?

SANTA

I'm just calming the kiddies.

(To children)

There's no need to worry about Santa.

He's just having a peaceful, adult

conversation with his nice Jewish friend,

The Hebrew Hammer.

HAMMER

Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?

SANTA

In fact, he's just informed me that he

personally plans on cancelling Christmas

this year.

SANTA (CONT'D)

Why don't we show him how that makes us

feel.

CUT TO:

HAMMER

C'mon!

THRONG (O.S.)

Where'd they go? I saw them go down that

hallway. C'mon, let's get em'!

HAMMER

It's over. We're doomed.

ESTHER

Shh. Shh, listen. Do you hear that?

HAMMER

What is that?

HARRIET TUBBELMAN

Psst. Hammer, Esther. This way. Hurry!

HAMMER

You saved our lives. Thank you. How can I

ever repay you...?

HARRIET TUBBELMAN

...My name is Harriet Tubbelman, but you

can call me Moses. The only payment I ask

Mordechai, is that you keep Hanukkah safe

for us all.

HARRIET TUBBELMAN (CONT'D)

You should be safe from here on out. Just

follow the river to it's conclusion.

HARRIET TUBBELMAN (CONT'D)

Oh yeah, and keep your arms and legs

inside the water craft at all times.

HAMMER

Where are we? What is this place?

HARRIET TUBBELMAN

Welcome to the Underground Jewish

Railroad. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy

the ride.

HAMMER

That got annoying fairly quickly.

ESTHER

Yeah, no kidding.

CARNIVAL WORKER

Tickets please.

CARNIVAL WORKER (CONT'D)

Thanks for riding the Underground Jewish

Railroad. If you plan on returning today,

please make sure to get you hands stamped

before you leave the alley.

HAMMER

Nah, we're kosher. Thanks though.

ESTHER

So, now what?

HAMMER

Now we wait for Santa to make his next

move.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Want to get a drink?

ESTHER

Sure. Why not.

BANDLEADER

Hey! The Hebrew Hammer everybody!

ESTHER

So, do you come here often!?

HAMMER

What was that!?

ESTHER

I said, do you come here often!?

HAMMER

Oh. Yeah, about once a week!

ESTHER

What!?

HAMMER

I said, yeah, about once a week!

ESTHER

Oh!

HASIDIC BAR PATRON

Would you like to dance?

HAMMER

I'm okay right now. Thanks though.

JOSHUA

Hey Morty, wanna cut a rug?

HAMMER

Nah, I'm good. I'm kind of here with

somebody.

JOSHUA

Oh. Okay. Maybe next time.

HAMMER

Yeah. Maybe next time Joshua. Take it

easy.

CHAIM FEYGELE

Well Shalom there mister!

HAMMER

Do we know each other?

CHAIM FEYGELE

No, but we have mutual friends.

CHAIM FEYGELE (CONT'D)

The name's Feygele. Chaim Feygele.

HAMMER

Mordechai. My friends call me Morty.

CHAIM FEYGELE

So Morty, I just love a man in a black

suit. Care to dance.

HAMMER

Uhhh. You know, I...have to go to the

bathroom. I'll be right back.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Hey there.

ESTHER

Hey.

HAMMER

Do you want to get out of here?

ESTHER

I would love to get out of here.

ESTHER

Ouch!

HAMMER

Sorry. I'm better with men.

ESTHER

(Sensually)

Maybe we should try a different kind of

dancing.

HAMMER

You mean like disco dancing or doing the

funky chicke...Oh. I get it.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Now we're talking Boobola.

ESTHER

Mordechai?

HAMMER

Yes Esther.

ESTHER

I want you to talk dirty to me.

HAMMER

Oh. Okay.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

I want to have lots of children by you.

Get a good paying, stable job. Settle

down in Long Island somewhere. Someplace

nice. Fancy. But not fancy schmancy.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

I want for our children to go to private

schools and take music lessons. Little

Abraham will go to Stanford for college,

Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.

ESTHER

Keep going.

HAMMER

Afterwards they'll make the decision as

to whether or not they'd like to continue

their religious studies in Israel.

Because, hey, after all we'll have

practiced the highly effective assertive

democratic style of child rearing,

sprinkled with a healthy dose of

liberalism.

ESTHER

Oh god, yes! Keep going! Don't stop!

HAMMER

Also, on a daily basis, I want you to

tell me what to do, where to do it, and

how I should live my life.

ESTHER

Kiss me you Semitic stud!

ESTHER (CONT'D)

(Playfully)

Hmm. I feel something poking around down

there. Maybe I should investigate. What

do you think about that Mr. Certified

Circumcised Dick?

ESTHER (CONT'D)

Shabat Shalom!

DISSOLVE TO:

ESTHER

Wow, that was amazing.

ESTHER (CONT'D)

What did you just snort?

HAMMER

Antihistamine. It's for my allergies. The

capsules make me gassy.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

You know, I've been thinking about what

Santa's got planned for us next. Maybe

he'll...

ESTHER

Your mother was right. You do work too

hard.

HAMMER

Oh, she said that, did she? What else did

Mommy Dearest have to say?

ESTHER

Well, she also said that you need to find

a nice girl to help take your mind off of

your work. I'm just glad she thought I

was good enough for you.

HAMMER

When did you guys have this conversation?

When I was in the bathroom? What else did

she have to say?

ESTHER

Relax Morty, I think your mom is

wonderful. She cares so much about you.

Get this, while you were gone she said

she'd help me get you to work with the

JDL if I'd come eat by you once in

awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be

with you. She's so...

HAMMER

What? You made a deal with my mother to

sleep with me if I'd help you?!

ESTHER

No. Of course...

HAMMER

What does that make you? What does that

make me? And my mother. What does that

make her?

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And

she's whoring her bitch-son out to the

highest bidder.

ESTHER

No. It's not like that. You're being

completely neurotic. I was just playing

along...

HAMMER

Always meddling in my life. This is so

typical of her.

(To Esther)

But from you? I thought we had something

good here.

ESTHER

We do!

HAMMER

I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we

can see each other romantically anymore.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Hammer here.

CHIEF

Hammer, it's the Chief. We've got

ourselves a situation. Get yourself down

here, I've got something you need to see.

STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO:

CHIEF

Mordechai. Thank god you're here.

HAMMER

What's up?

CHIEF

About an hour ago, we received this

transmission from the North Pole.

SANTA

And now my Hanukkah loving friends, I

will reveal to you the true nature of my

diabolical scheme.

SANTA (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The Jewish Atomic clock, located in the

outskirts of Jerusalem. Keeper of time

for the Jewish Calendar. Powered by

Judeum. An element so rare, it exists

only inside the clock itself.

SANTA (CONT'D)

Once I extract the Judeum from the clock,

the Jewish Calendar will cease to exist,

forever eradicating Hanukkah. In less

than twenty four hours, which by your

Jewish Calendar is approximately...

SANTA (CONT'D)

(To someone at North Pole)

Can I borrow that pen and notepad?

SANTA (CONT'D)

(Uncertain)

Four years and three quarters a lunar

cycle?

(Shifting back into psycho

mode)

Well, whatever! In less than twenty four

Christian hours, Hanukkah will be nothing

more than a fond memory. Tiny Tim.

TINY TIM

Merry Christmas everybody, and god bless

us, everyone.

SANTA

End transmission.

SANTA (CONT'D)

So, how was I?

TINY TIM

It was good. Very chilling, but you still

got all the points across that we talked

about.

SANTA

Really? Good, good.

SANTA (CONT'D)

I wasn't too over the top?

TINY TIM

No, it was the perfect level.

SANTA

Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up

that new KC and the Sunshine Band record

that you recommended. You were right, it

is good.

SANTA (CONT'D)

(To O.S. Cameraman)

Why is the red light on the camera still

on? Are you still filming me!?

SANTA (CONT'D)

You fucking ass...

HAMMER

Looks like I got a plane to catch.

CHIEF

Take Esther with you, you'll need the

backup.

HAMMER

No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my

days of hooking are over.

ESTHER

You're not my bitch Mordechai. Please,

you have to believe me.

CHIEF

Did I miss something here?

HAMMER

It's a long story. I'll explain when I

get back from saving the clock.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Alone.

CHIEF

Tail him. He's gonna need the help.

There's Santa now.

No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the

Step forward son!

Uh, he can't sir. The harnesses.

SANTA

You gonna learn to guide this sled right?

You gonna make sure your men follow suit?

Because if I'm puking down chimneys come

Christmas Eve, I'm gonna have your hide.

We clear?

SANTA (CONT'D)

You eyeballin' me son!?

SANTA (CONT'D)

I didn't think so.

SANTA

Get moving! We've got work to do!

Uh. Can you just give me one second?

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Let's dance the hora!

SANTA

Get him boys!

ESTHER

Mordechai! Behind you!

HAMMER

What are you doing here?

ESTHER

Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you

do this alone.

HAMMER

I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking

out yesterday. I was wrong.

ESTHER

I forgive you.

HAMMER

Go check on the clock. I'll finish up

here.

TINY TIM

Uh oh.

SANTA

Get off of me you cripple!

TINY TIM

What are we gonna do? He's got us on the

ropes.

ESTHER

What's the matter?

HAMMER

I don't know. I'm feeling kind of tired.

SANTA

What's going on? Why'd he stop?

TINY TIM

Maybe he ran out of ammo.

SANTA

Take a look.

TINY TIM

Well, he's kinda just resting in the

corner with his girlfriend.

SANTA

Resting?

SANTA (CONT'D)

What day is it?

TINY TIM

It's Friday.

SANTA

What time is it?

TINY TIM

I don't know. About sundown I guess.

SANTA

Why didn't I think of this? It's the

Sabbath.

SANTA (CONT'D)

The day of rest. He can't fight on the

Sabbath. C'mon, get up. We've got him

beat.

SANTA (CONT'D)

Well, well, well. It looks as if the

Hebrew Hammer's got a weakness after all.

SANTA (CONT'D)

Finish extracting the Judeum from the

clock.

(To Tiny Tim)

Tiny Tim, I want you to introduce the

Hebrew Hammer to the Christmas spirit.

TINY TIM

You want me to be nice to him for no

apparent reason whatsoever, buy him

clothing he'll never wear, and for just

one day of the year pretend to forgive

him for all the horrible things he did to

me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't

looking?

SANTA

No dipshit, I want you to kill him.

TINY TIM

Oh.

SANTA

Santa's gonna take the sled back to the

North Pole and celebrate his victory with

his new stocking stuffer.

HAMMER

Esther!

ESTHER

TINY TIM

So why the long face?

HAMMER

It's Esther. Santa's got her.

You're a mench. Thank you.

Mordechai, by any means necessary, you

bring my Esther back to me. Even if it

requires using Judaism's most powerful

weapon.

Oh no, not the...

HAMMER (CONT'D)

There won't be any need for that sir.

SAMMY DAVIS JR. JR.

You two cats are beautiful. I love you

MOHAMMED

What's wrong with him?

HAMMER

He's still working out some identity

issues.

STAR OF DAVID WIPE TO:

HAMMER

It's gonna be tough, but the back

entrance looks like our best bet.

MOHAMMED

I wanted to ask you, how were you able to

pinpoint the exact location of Santa's

workshop? We've been trying to gain that

piece of surveillance for years.

HAMMER

This is the year 5734. It's time the boys

at the KLF got into the 58th century. Let

me show you something.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

The JDL supplies all its agents with this

state of the art device called a laptop

computator.

MOHAMMED

Cool. What's it do?

HAMMER

Now this might get a bit technical, but

try and stay with me. Using a highly

sophisticated connection of other

computators, called the Internet, I can

access surveillance maps, villian

biographical information, and even sports

scores with a few simple keystrokes of

this electronic typewriter.

MOHAMMED

Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!

HAMMER

But wait, there's more. With a few swift

clicks of this hand-computer interface,

commonly referred to as a mouse, I can

download illicit pornographic material

and even send it along to a friend via a

cyber postal route known as e-mail.

MOHAMMED

Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get

porno on that thing?

HAMMER

Oh yeah. Take a look.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

For example, here's a picture of your

sister Tawanda getting freaky with a

German Shepard.

MOHAMMED

Gettin' freaky with a what?

MOHAMMED (CONT'D)

Oy vey, that's almost as bad. That's

Tawanda getting freaky with a notorious

white supremacist.

MOHAMMED (CONT'D)

Where's the white out button on this

thing?

COMPUTERIZED FEMALE VOICE

Message sent.

MOHAMMED

What just happened?

HAMMER

Remember that bit about the cyber postal

route?

MOHAMMED

Yeah.

HAMMER

Nah, forget about it.

SANTA

Rudolph, more egg nog!

SANTA (CONT'D)

Ho, ho, ho.

SASSY BLACK PROSTITUTE

Listen motherfucker, I already told you!

I don't care how much yo ass is payin'

me, if you call me that one more time

there ain't gonna be no more visits down

to the South Pole! You feelin' me!?

SANTA

Yes maam, loud and clear.

SASSY BLACK PROSTITUTE

Damn sugar, what happened to you?

TINY TIM

Santa, I got some really bad news.

MOHAMMED

What are you doing?

HAMMER

Just praying to god that we don't kill

ourselves going over this wall.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

You know, you don't have to hold on to my

waist. You're tied in.

MOHAMMED

I knew that.

MOHAMMED

Well, that was easy.

HAMMER

Wait! Before we enter, you need to know

that my research has determined that

Santa's compound is wired with the XP

2000 stereo type alarm system.

MOHAMMED

A stereo type alarm system?

HAMMER

Take a look.

MOHAMMED

How do we bypass it?

HAMMER

The alarm will trigger if the system

detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies

inside the building. For example, if you

were to dribble a basketball, or eat

watermelon, or use the word dawg...that

is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the

letter o...within the confines of this

workshop, the alarm would sound.

MOHAMMED

Listen cat, I'll have you know that I

hate the taste of watermelon and am a

terrible basketball player.

HAMMER

Well that's good news for us. It means

the system is outdated. This should be

easy. C'mon.

MOHAMMED

It's all clear. Let's go.

HAMMER

Mo, I think you dropped some...

MOHAMMED

Hammer, no!

LOUDSPEAKERS

Jewdar alert! Jewdar alert!

HAMMER

Let's go!

HAMMER (CONT'D)

C'mon, let's go!

MOHAMMED

What are you doing?

HAMMER

Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic

Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.

CUT TO:

MOHAMMED

There's Tiny Tim.

MOHAMMED (CONT'D)

I'll take Tiny Tim. You go find your

woman.

SANTA

Hey, what's that over there? Is that a

bowl of Matzah Ball soup?

HAMMER

Damn!

CUT TO:

MOHAMMED

Now I'm gonna do to you what I should

have done earlier.

TINY TIM

My crutches. Noooo. Not my crutches.

HAMMER

Where's my girlfriend Santa?

SANTA

I don't have to tell you anything Hammer!

You're gonna have to kill me before I

tell you!

HAMMER

But if I kill you, then you'll be dead.

SANTA

Good point.

HAMMER

Don't worry your pretty little head.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

That was a warning shot.

ESTHER (O.S.)

Mordechai! I'm in here! Help!

SANTA

Looks like the tables have turned once

again Hammer.

SANTA (CONT'D)

And you won't even be able to say goodbye

to your Esther. So sad. So long

Mordechai. Give my father my regards.

HAMMER

Wait! I didn't want it to come to this,

but you leave me no choice. I have no

other option but to use the most powerful

weapon in the Jewish arsenal.

SANTA

What are you doing?

HAMMER

I shlepped all the way to the North Pole

for this? I come to fight you, and you

don't even put out anything to nosh on?

What kind of arch nemesis are you?

SANTA

Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on

me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.

HAMMER

What sort of host would treat company

this way? Esther is clearly uncomfortable

in your guest room. I'm shvitizing from

running around shooting people. And my

feet. What kind of flooring is this

anyway? My arches are killing me.

SANTA

No. Stop it!

HAMMER

And to top it off, you didn't even have

the courtesy to give me a proper hello

when I entered the room. What have I ever

done to you to be treated with such

disrespect?

SANTA

Please, make it stop. I'll do anything.

Here take my gun.

SANTA (CONT'D)

Shoot me. Please, just one to the head.

Put me out of misery.

MOHAMMED

Hammer, you alright?

HAMMER

Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.

HAMMER

Esther!

ESTHER

Mordechai!

HAMMER

Joseph Lieberman?

JOSEPH LIEBERMAN

Mordechai! Thank god you're here.

ESTHER

You two know each other?

HAMMER

We go to the same temple.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Mo, get him out of my sight.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

No, wait. I need closure here.

(To Santa)

I just wanna say one thing. You know

where you messed up Santa? You

underestimated the true meaning of

Hanukkah.

SANTA

Please tell me. What is the true meaning

of Hanukkah?

HAMMER

That's...that's a very good question. And

I do know that it does have something to

do with...dreidels, and...

ESTHER

...and latkes.

HAMMER

And latkes! And some miracle oil that

lasted eight days. And that my friend,

should've been enough for you. Take him

away Mo.

SANTA

I'm sorry. I see the light now. I was

wrong. I'm...

HAMMER

Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal, will you

marry me?

ESTHER

Yes! Of course! I'd gladly give up my

last name to be with you.

JOE LIEBERMAN

What happened out there?

JOE LIEBERMAN (CONT'D)

Oh Mordechai, you know how I detest gore.

HAMMER

Well then maybe you should have thought

about that before you ran with him.

C'mon, let's get you back to Washington.

MRS. CARVER

Shabat Shalom everybody!

HAMMER/ESTHER

Shabat Shalom!

HAMMER

And a Merry Christmas to all of our

Gentile friends. Mun Chi.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Before we start the Sabbath, I'd

personally just like to thank god for all

the blessings I've received over the past

year. A beautiful fiancee...

HAMMER (CONT'D)

...a wonderful mother...

HAMMER (CONT'D)

...and the opportunity to help my

brothers and sisters in the Jewish

community.

MRS. CARVER

Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba

Shaina, and eating by your mother for

Shabos.

HAMMER

Thanks mom.

MRS. CARVER

But with all the attention the newspapers

and television have given you, you'd

think that you were the pope or

something.

HAMMER

(Proudly)

Well, I did save Hanukkah mom. My

children, and my children's children, and

my children's children's children...

HAMMER (CONT'D)

...and their children will all be able to

eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light

the menorah with the knowl...

MRS. CARVER

(Interrupting)

...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot.

I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it

isn't even one of the high holidays.

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

Now, if you had saved Passover or Yom

Kipur, then maybe you'd have what to brag

about. Did I tell you that my friend

Maureen's son, the Investment Banker, was

responsible for a very big merger on...

HAMMER

...No, no, no, no, no. I see what you're

doing here. So all of a sudden Hanukkah's

not good enough for you, is that right?

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Well I have news for you mom. It is good

enough...I'm good enough and I won't

leave here until I hear you tell me...

MRS. CARVER

Mazel Tov!

MRS. CARVER (CONT'D)

Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee

boo...

HAMMER

...I'm not finished yet, mom.

MRS. CARVER

...A boojee boojee boojee boo.  What's

that Mazel Tov? Your tuchus needs some

more airing out?

HAMMER

Mom! We're eating!

MRS. CARVER

What a good poop you made in your diaper

Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you!

Such a good boy you are!

HAMMER

Oh, I get it. To you, the cat pooping in

his diaper is somehow better than my

saving a Jewish holiday.

(Giving up)

Forget it.

MRS. CARVER

So, what are you two planning after the

wedding?

ESTHER

Well, for starters, we're going to

honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then,

when we get back, Morty's been talking

about taking a stable, good paying job as

a consultant for the JDL.

MRS. CARVER

Well, I couldn't be happier for the both

of you.

HAMMER

I think I hear the new Santa Claus busy

at work. C'mon.

MRS. CARVER

I forgot to ask you, who'd they put in

charge as the new Santa Claus?

HAMMER

Since Santa will be living out the rest

of his days at a home for the

religionally insane and because he had no

blood heirs, the Kwanzaa Liberation Front

and the Jewish Defense League agreed to

make the whole Santa Claus process a

democratic vote. We're all very pleased

with the first Santa elect.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Look, there he is now.

HAMMER (CONT'D)

Merry Christmas Jamal.

JAMAL

Merry Christmas Niggas!
