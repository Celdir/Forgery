Nightmare on Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare

JACOB

Do you hear that?

GREYHAIRED MAN

Hear what?

JACOB

That noise.

GREYHAIRED MAN

I don't hear anything.

JACOB

Excuse me.

STEWARDESS

Yes?

JACOB

What is that sound?

STEWARDESS

That's just the engines, sir.

JACOB

No, it's different.  It's not the

engines.  It's getting louder.

STEWARDESS

We're just gaining altitude to get above

some rough weather.  That's the sound of

the engines speeding up a bit.

Everything's fine.

JACOB

Um...okay.

JACOB (cont'd)

Can't you hear that?

GREYHAIRED MAN

(losing patience)

Look, kid.  Will you relax?  It's just

the damn engines, okay?

THE CHILDREN

One two, Freddy's coming for you...

THE CHILDREN (cont'd)

Three four, better lock your door...

THE CHILDREN (cont'd)

Five six, grab your crucifix...

THE CHILDREN (cont'd)

Seven eight, gonna stay up late...

CHILD

Nine ten, never sleep again!

JACOB

No!

CUT TO:

JACOB

Yeah..

ALICE

You okay, honey?

JACOB

Yeah, Mom.  I'm fine.

ALICE

Alright.  Better get cooking or you'll be

late for school.

JACOB

On my way.

JACOB

Get the hell out of here!  It's coming!

WOMAN

What's coming?

JACOB

Don't you see it?

WOMAN

See what?

WOMAN (cont'd)

Kids...watcha gonna do?

FREDDY (O.S.)

Jacob!  You're too old to run away from

home!

FREDDY

Payback time...

JACOB

No!

FREDDY

Don't worry, I have a strong stomach.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Springwood is mine, boy!

JACOB

I dreamed you away before I was born!

Mom said you couldn't come back!

FREDDY

Is that true?  Then she told you all

about me, huh? Let's see what else she

has to say.

ALICE

Run, Jacob!

JACOB

Leave her alone!

FREDDY

You're such a momma's boy!

JACOB

You fucker!

FREDDY

Springwood is only the beginning.  All I

need from you is a ride!

FREDDY (cont'd)

See ya later!

SOUND COP

WAKE UP!

CUT TO:

JACOB

Mom...

MR. HOPKINS

Clean up your act somewhere else!

JACOB

What's going on?

KAREN

Free speech.  The right of assembly.

JACOB

What is this place?

KAREN

It's a home.  A foster home.  For

teenagers.  It's where you go when things

get bad.  It's the place to figure out

what to do next.  It's a home for kids

that no one else wants.

(beat)

It's MY home.

JACOB

Oh...

MR. HOPKINS

Why can't you find somewhere else to

shack up?

KAREN

What have we ever done to you?

MR. HOPKINS

Nothing...YET.

MR. HOPKINS (cont'd)

Look, we've been here for years.  This is

a quiet street.  We'd just like to keep

it that way.

JACOB

Lighten up, mister.

MR. HOPKINS

(smirks)

And what gutter did you crawl out from,

kid?

(frowns)

We don't want your kind here.

JACOB

My kind?  What kind is that?

MR. HOPKINS

Drug addicts.  Dope pushers.  We have

stand up and take charge.

JACOB

Swell.  I've just got a couple of

questions for you...Do you love your

parents?

MR. HOPKINS

Of course I do...

JACOB

Are they alive?

MR. HOPKINS

My mother is.

JACOB

What's it like?

KAREN

Assholes.

JACOB

I can think of a stronger word.  Are you

okay?

KAREN

Yeah.  Thanks.  I'm Karen.

JACOB

Jacob.

KAREN

Are YOU okay?

JACOB

Yeah.  I just haven't had much to eat

lately.

KAREN

Then come help me unpack.

KAREN

I guess the sandwich is alright, huh?

JACOB

It's incredible.  Best I've ever had.

KAREN

You're not from around here, are you?

JACOB

No.  I've been on the road for a couple

of days.

KAREN

Do you need a place to stay?

MARY

So, we have to get it fixed.

DAVID

We don't have the money to get it fixed.

KAREN

What's wrong?

DAVID

Our plumbing has a bad case of hardening

of the arteries.  Who's your friend?

KAREN

This is Jacob.

JACOB

Jacob Johnson.

DAVID

David Ross.  My wife, Mary.

KAREN

They run this house.  They're helping me

and three other ids get a footing in

reality before they kick us out of the

nest to make room for the next batch.

DAVID

If there is a next batch.  I see the

welcome wagon is back.  Was there any

trouble?

KAREN

A little.  Jacob came to my rescue.

MARY

(pleasant)

Where you from, Jacob?

JACOB

Springwood.

MARY

Springwood?  Where's that?

JACOB

Upstate about a hundred miles.

DAVID

(suspicious)

I know this state like the back of my

hand.  I've never heard of Springwood.

KAREN

Jacob's a little down on his luck.  I

told him he could stay here a few days.

MARY

Are your parents in Springwood?

JACOB

My father died before I was born.  My

mother, she's dead, too.

DAVID

You have a legal guardian?

JACOB

No.

DAVID

Been in any state or federal program?

JACOB

No.

KAREN

Just for a little while.  So he can get

his bearings.

DAVID

Got any ID?

MARY

(to David)

I think we can help him out, honey.  The

budget's tight, but we can't turn down

someone in need.

DAVID

Okay.  You got three, maybe four days to

rest up while we try and find a more

permanent arrangement for you.  But his

isn't going to be a free ride.  We're

part of a community summer work project

and eighty percent of the money you make

goes to the house.  Everybody works - and

that includes you.  Are you on drugs?

JACOB

No.

DAVID

Good.  If I catch anything stronger then

an aspirin on you, you're outta here.  No

arguments.  You got that straight?

JACOB

Yes, sir.

DAVID

Okay.  Dinner in two hours.  Why don't

you go meet the rest of the gang.

KAREN

Thanks, David.

MARY

I'll go fix up the spare bed in Wesley's

room.

DAVID

And take a shower, for chrissakes.

KAREN

Hey, guys, I got someone for you to meet.

This is Jacob.  Jacob, this is Wesley and

Gina.

JACOB

Hi.

WESLEY

Welcome to fun central.

KAREN

He's going to be staying with us for a

while.

GINA

Oh yeah?  How'd you get through the

blockade?

SCOTT

Hey, beautiful.  How's it going?

KAREN

Hi, Scott.

SCOTT

Who's Barney Rubble?

KAREN

This is Jacob Johnson.  He's a new

resident.  At least temporarily.

SCOTT

He better not be rooming with me.  I

value my privacy.

KAREN

No, I believe that honor goes to Wesley.

WESLEY

Good.  I could use the company.

SCOTT

So what's your story?  Divorce?  Custody

battle?  Your parents just plain

assholes?

JACOB

They're dead.

KAREN

Mellow out, Scott.  Give him a chance to

settle in.

SCOTT

Just curious.

JACOB

Is he alright?

SCOTT

He'll be fine.  He just has a problem

with cigarettes.

GINA

His parents used to use them as a sick

kind of discipline.  That's why he's

here.

JACOB

If you know that, then why do you smoke

in front of him?

SCOTT

It's not my problem.

JACOB

Just what is YOUR problem, then?

SCOTT

I took care of my problem.  That's why

I'M here.

KAREN

His dad used to beat him.  One day he

couldn't take it any more.

JACOB

What happened?

KAREN

He killed him with his father's gun.

Self-defense.

GINA

Everyone here has a fun tale to tell.

Isn't that right, Karen?

KAREN

Yeah.  Right.

KAREN

Why don't you go to bed?

JACOB

I can't sleep.

KAREN

You need to talk?

JACOB

No.  I'm fine.  Thanks.

SCOTT

Come on.  Let's hop to it.  Gotta make

way for those new indoor tennis courts.

The fate of the world lies in the

balance.  Okay, this load's full.

SCOTT (cont'd)

You got that?

JACOB

Yeah, no problem.

SCOTT

I don't know.  Maybe you should think

about switching to de-caf or something.

JACOB

You okay?

GINA

No!  Yes!  Let go of me!

KAREN

She doesn't like to be touched.

JACOB

No shit!

KAREN

Don't take it personally.  It's not her

fault.

JACOB

What happened to her?

KAREN

Her mother was a hooker.  She forced Gina

to carry on the tradition.  When she was

thirteen...

JACOB

Jesus.

KAREN

You look terrible.

JACOB

(smiling)

Thanks.

KAREN

I'm sorry...I just wish you'd tell me

what happened to you, that's all.

JACOB

I can't talk about it right now.  I'll

tell you later.  I promise.

KAREN

Okay.  Why don't you sit and rest for a

bit.  The supervisor's not around.  You

look like you could use it.

JACOB

I think I will.

VOICE

Hey, you!

SUPERVISOR

No slacking off.  Back to work.

JACOB

What!  Jesus fucking...Oh, shit!

SUPERVISOR

Whoa!  Get a grip, boy.

JACOB

Huh?  What's going on?

SUPERVISOR

Nothing.  That's the problem.  Now that

you've gotten your beauty rest, let's see

if you can change it, okay?

WESLEY

Aren't you going to bed?

JACOB

I'm not tired.

WESLEY

Bullshit.  If you looked any more tired,

you'd be dead.

JACOB

That's right.

WESLEY

You gotta sleep, man.

JACOB

Why?  Who says?  You know, people don't

even really know why we sleep.  They

haven't found any physical reason for it.

WESLEY

But they do know that you go nuts if you

don't.

JACOB

Sharks don't sleep.  They can't pump

water through their gills on their own.

They have to always keep moving.  If they

stop, they can't breath.  If they go to

sleep, they die.

WESLEY

You're not a shark.

JACOB

I know.  I'm just a kid.  Don't worry

about me, Wes.  Go to sleep.

FREDDY

You can't stay awake forever, boy!

WESLEY

I told you you'd go nuts!

JACOB

Get everybody else.  I have to tell them

something.

WESLEY

In the middle of the night?

JACOB

I MEAN it!

SCOTT

I don't get it.  Is this guy alive or

dead?

JACOB

He's neither.  He haunts your dreams and

if he kills you, you die for real.

WESLEY

I haven't dreamed of him. I have

nightmares like you wouldn't believe, but

never of this guy.

SCOTT

That's because this all rates an eleven

on the bullshit meter!  I don't know why

we have to listen to this crap.  You're

scaring the hell out of Wes here.

GINA

Keep your voice down.

SCOTT

It doesn't matter.  The Ross's sleep like

rocks, which is what we all should be

doing.

JACOB

I know this sounds crazy, but I swear

it's true.  I went to bed one night and

woke up in the middle of the road.

Freddy Krueger killed my mother, blasted

my whole town into his nightmare, and,

worst of all, I think he wants to use me

to kill more kids and bring more towns

into his world.

KAREN

How?

JACOB

I'm not sure.  I think I'm some kind of

carrier.  He's somehow inside me and as

soon as I fall deep enough into sleep

he'll be let loose.  You guys were great

to take me in.  I just don't want to

thank you by getting you all killed.

SCOTT

Okay.  Show me Springwood.

SCOTT (cont'd)

There's nothing there.

JACOB

That's what I've been trying to tell you.

SCOTT

There's NEVER been a town there.

JACOB

That's how YOU see it.  I was part of the

nightmare, so I'm the only one who

notices the difference.

SCOTT

Look, Jacob.  You don't have to convince

us that nightmares are real.  Everybody

in this room has been through one.  And

some of us are still living it.  But the

thing is, we know it's just in our heads

now.  It can be just as bad as the real

thing was, but it's still only a memory.

It can't hurt us physically, unless we do

the hurting ourselves.

GINA

And we don't want to see you get hurt.

WESLEY

We know it gets crazy.  And we'll help

out the best we can.

SCOTT

But this is just too hard to believe.

JACOB

You don't believe me, either, do you?

KAREN

I don't know.

JACOB

Why are you still here?

KAREN

I'm not sure.  I guess, I guess I see a

lot of me in you.

JACOB

Feels good to see someone more fucked up

than yourself, huh?

KAREN

Yeah.  That must be it.

JACOB

But you haven't told me why you're here

at this place.

KAREN

I can't talk about it right now.  Maybe

later.  Do you want me to stay with you?

JACOB

Yeah, that'd be great.  Don't let me

sleep, okay?

KAREN

I'll do my best.

KAREN (cont'd)

Thank God for cable TV.

JACOB

Yeah.  Thank God.

KAREN

Where are you going?

JACOB

I'm leaving.

KAREN

Why?

JACOB

He can't hurt you if I'm gone.  Maybe

I'll go to the desert or something.  I'll

lie down in the middle of nowhere and

finally get some sleep.  Krueger can feed

of the dreams of snakes and vultures.

KAREN

Fine.  You're just going to take off

then...

JACOB

Don't do this to me.  I'm just trying to

protect you and the others.

KAREN

Right.  You blow into town and then blow

right out.  Terrific.

JACOB

I don't understand why you're so mad at

me.

KAREN

You just don't get it, do you?

JACOB

Get what?

JACOB (cont'd)

Maybe I'm crazy.

KAREN

Running away doesn't help.

JACOB

And you're going to convince me, huh?

KAREN

Maybe.

KAREN (cont'd)

I'm going to make some coffee.  You

promise not to move?

JACOB

Yeah.  Sure.

ALICE

Jacob!  Help me!

ALICE (cont'd)

No-o-o-o-o!

FREDDY

Say it, don't spray it, huh, Jacob?  Come

and join the fun!

JACOB (O.S.)

NOOOOOOO!

KAREN

Jacob!

JACOB

Nooooo!

MR. HOPKINS

I told you!  It's an overdose!  Jesus

Christ, I saw this coming.  Call 9-1-1!

JACOB

No!  Don't let them take me!

KAREN

Jacob, it'll be alright.

AMBULANCE GUY #1

Calm down, kid.  We'll take care of you.

JACOB

You don't understand!  Let me go!

DAVID

This is just what we need.

JACOB

Don't fucking put me under!  You'll set

him free!

JACOB (cont'd)

He'll kill them all...

FREDDY (O.S.)

Every town as an Elm Street!

FREDDY

Thanks for the lift, kid!

JACOB

What do you want from me?

FREDDY

I already got it!  The rest I'm going to

get from your new little friends.

JACOB

Leave them alone!

FREDDY

It's my duty to clean up the

neighborhood!

JACOB

What have you done with my town?

FREDDY

Aw, poor baby's homesick, isn't he?

Don't worry.  We'll all be one happy

family soon.  Wanna be the first recruit?

FREDDY (cont'd)

What's the matter?  Don't want to be part

of my expansion project?

FREDDY (cont'd)

Today, Rosedale.  Tomorrow, the world!

JACOB

Over my dead body!

FREDDY

As you wish.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Uh oh. Too many parking tickets.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Don't interfere!

BLADE COP

We have to.

SOUND COP

It's our job.

FREDDY

Get a new one.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Time to blow this joint.

FREDDY (cont'd)

You'll never get me, coppers!

POWER COP

Goddamnit!

JACOB

Alright...just who the hell are you guys?

BLADE COP

We're the Dream Police.

JACOB

The what?

POWER COP

The Dream Police.  Didn't you hear her,

man?

POWER COP (cont'd)

We try and save this guy's ass and then

he goes off and cops an attitude.

SOUND COP

I think you're the wrong guy to talk

about attitudes.

BLADE COP

Guys, guys.  This is getting us nowhere.

JACOB

Hello?  May I butt in here and ask some

more stupid questions?

BLADE COP

We don't know much more than you do.

What we do know is that we've been

recruited...

JACOB

By who?

SOUND COP

We don't know.

JACOB

Why?

BLADE COP

I think that's obvious.

POWER COP

The shit's about to hit the fan.

SOUND COP

Krueger's discovered new powers.

BLADE COP

He's ripped a hole between dreams and

reality.

POWER COP

Our own powers have been amplified.

SOUND COP

We only hope it will be enough.

BLADE COP

But we're going to need your help.

JACOB

Me?  What can I do?  Just who are you

guys...really?

BLADE COP

We were like you.  We fought Freddy

Krueger many years ago.  Our souls were

released from his grip.  No we're back to

try again.

JACOB

I still don't understand what...

SOUND COP

Freddy Krueger can't hurt us anymore.

POWER COP

Because we're already dead.

JACOB

What's going on?

DOCTOR

Just relax, everything's fine.

JACOB

That's what you say...

DOCTOR

You're lucky you're here instead of

juvenile hall.  You put up quite a fight.

But you're clean.  No traces of drugs or

alcohol in your blood.

JACOB

I could've told you that.

DOCTOR

Hold on there.

JACOB

You said I was fine.  I have to get back.

My friends are in trouble.

DOCTOR

I said you weren't on drugs, but I never

said you were fine.  You're suffering

from extreme fatigue and stress that

manifested itself into one hell of an

anxiety attack.  At least that's what we

hope it is.  You had a major seizure,

Jacob.

JACOB

You don't understand.  This whole town is

in danger.

DOCTOR

We're keeping you here for observation.

You're not going anywhere tonight.

JACOB

You can't do that.  You don't have the

right!

DOCTOR

Yes we do.  Your temporary guardian, Mr.

Ross, signed all the papers.  If you're

okay in the morning we might let you go

home.  Until then, you're bed bound.

JACOB

But...

DOCTOR

We took off the restraints.  Do you want

us to put them back on?

DAVID

Sleep.

JACOB

Shit...

CUT TO:

GINA

Nice movie, huh?  And I came in here to

mellow out.

GINA (cont'd)

It's all yours.

ORDERLY ON TV

Relax, will ya, buddy? Everything's gonna

be just swell.

SECOND ORDERLY

Yeah, mac.  You've just had a hard day,

that's all.

ORDERLY ON TV

You heard the man, Wesley.  Just relax.

Have a smoke with us.

SECOND ORDERLY

Yeah, Wesley.  Have a smoke.

WESLEY

Fuck this.

WESLEY (cont'd)

Hey.

FIRST ORDERLY

Relax, Wesley.

WESLEY

Dad?

FREDDY

Yeah, Wesley.  Everything's gonna be

great!  Just have a smoke on us!

FREDDY

Didn't Daddy ever tell you what the

Surgeon General says...?

FREDDY (cont'd)

Smoking's bad for your health!

FREDDY (cont'd)

Ah!  A match made in heaven!

FREDDY (cont'd)

Ahhhh!  Now we're smokin'!

FREDDY (cont'd)

What's your sign, Wesley?  It wouldn't be

Cancer, would it?

FREDDY (cont'd)

Now say the secret word and you know what

you'll win...

WESLEY

Go to hell!

FREDDY

Right...

WESLEY

Noooooooo!

ASSISTANT

I don't get it.  The couch is barely

scorched.  And how can he burn from just

the neck down?

CORONER

It happens.

ASSISTANT

It happens?  That's your explanation?

CORONER

I've seen worse.

ASSISTANT

What?  What worse?

CORONER

Never mind.

ASSISTANT

No.  I wanna know.  Really.  What could

be worse than...

FIRE MARSHALL

You know what the gossip rags are going

to say?  Spontaneous human combustion.

COP

What's that?

FIRE MARSHALL

That's where bodies are supposed to go up

in smoke for no reason.  It's all psychic

bullshit.  What really happened is called

the candle effect.  A tiny fire gets

started, usually from a cigarette.  It

slowly smolders through the blanket and

clothes until the skin starts to actually

bake.  The body fat begins to melt and

liquefy, fueling the fire like a slow

burning candle.  It takes hours, but it's

real.

COP

He fell asleep while smoking.  What a

waste.

SCOTT

That's impossible.

JACOB

Who?

KAREN

Wes...

JACOB

Oh my God.  It's started.

SCOTT

He fucking burned alive.

KAREN

They said he fell asleep smoking.

SCOTT

And we all know that can't be.

JACOB

I already told you how it would happen.

SCOTT

Don't start with that shit.

JACOB

It's not shit.

DAVID

C'mon, kids.  Everyone inside.  Now.

DAVID

We have to be strong.

DAVID (cont'd)

We need to pull together and help each

other.  Mrs. Ross is upstairs in bed.

She's pretty messed up.  We need to help

her deal with this.

SCOTT

He would never touch a cigarette.  You

know that.

DAVID

We don't know anything until the

authorities are finished with their

investigation.  In the mean time, no work

for tomorrow - three day weekend.  But

Monday, it's back on the job.  Jacob

wasn't covered in our health plan and his

little stint at the hospital cost us a

bundle.  We have to work together or we

might lose this place.  Okay?

JACOB

When I was put under, Freddy was

released.  I know this because I dreamed

it.

SCOTT

And that dream was real?

JACOB

Yes.  Wesley was his first victim.

SCOTT

Aw, man...

JACOB

You said it yourself.  How could it have

been a cigarette?

KAREN

And how could he...dire that way and not

wake up?

GINA

(mockingly)

Maybe the "authorities" will figure it

out.

SCOTT

I'm sorry.  I just can't buy into this.

JACOB

Call me crazy...but I think he's after

Rosedale.  The whole place.  In my dream

he said something about needing a few

souls to get the job done. I think he has

to kill in order to get the power to suck

in a new town.

SCOTT

You are crazy.

JACOB

Thank you.  There's more.  There are...

other people in there.  In the

nightmares.

KAREN

Like him?

JACOB

No. Different.  There are three of them.

They're dressed in black. They have

powers like Freddy, but they seem to be

on our side.

KAREN

Who are they?

JACOB

Well, you gotta hang in there with me on

this one.  They call themselves... the

Dream Police.

SCOTT

This is too much.

GINA

You mean...like cops?

JACOB

I guess.

KAREN

Where are they from?

JACOB

They're kids that Freddy killed years

ago.  THEY don't even know how they got

there.  But they're somehow patrolling

dreamworld to put a stop to Krueger.

SCOTT

Then why haven't these guys done the job

already?

JACOB

They say they need help.  I don't know

what or why...yet.

SCOTT

I can tell you who needs help.

JACOB

Hey, I'm trying to save all of us.

SCOTT

I won't believe it until I see it.

JACOB

By then it'll be too late.  It was too

late for Wesley.

KAREN

They're going to use all this to shut us

down.

JACOB

I know.  It's my fault.

KAREN

You going to try to run away again?

JACOB

It's too late for that. I have to stay

and try and put a stop to it.

KAREN

I'm sorry.  It's all so hard to accept.

JACOB

I wish I could convince you of the danger

you and the others are in.

KAREN

I've been in danger before. THAT I can

handle.

JACOB

This is worse than anything you can

imagine.

KAREN

I wouldn't be so sure about that.  Come

on.  Let's go inside.

KAREN

She was great. Loving.  Supportive,

caring - everything a mom should be.

Except she had one fatal flow: my father.

You see, she was raised at a time when

they still had the "obey" part in the

wedding vows.  He was always jealous.

She couldn't talk to another man without

him thinking she wanted to go to bed with

him.  He never hit me. But the things he

did to her...and she would always just

take it.  She never fought back.  He'd

get drunk and...she'd tell people she

just fell down or something.  Then one

night...I was thirteen.  Something

happened.  My mom suddenly wouldn't take

it anymore.  Something made her say

enough is enough.  She hit back.  Tat

only made it worse.  I watched as he hit

her over and over.  Then he knocked her

down the stairs.  She broke her neck.

And when y father saw what he'd done - he

finally became human.  He cried over her

body for a while, then went into the

garage and blew his brains out with a

shotgun.  To this day I don't remember

what that final straw was.  The shrinks

say I've blocked it out of my memory.

There's no one else alive who knows what

really happened.  I have dreams about it

sometimes, but there's always that blank

spot.  A missing piece.

JACOB

I'm sorry.

KAREN

I know nightmares are real, Jacob.  I

know.

JACOB

So did my mom.  She taught me a lot about

dreams.

KAREN

Like what?

JACOB

She told me that a lot of people have

special dream powers.  I inherited some

from her - and some I have all to myself.

She showed me how I could link up with

other people's dreams - to actually be

inside with them.

KAREN

That sounds wonderful.  But...I don't

know...

JACOB

A little hard to imagine, huh?

KAREN

Yeah.  I'm sorry.

JACOB

I can convince you.

KAREN

How?

JACOB

Easy.  We're doing it now.

KAREN

What do you mean?

JACOB

I mean we're dreaming.  You and me.

Together.

JACOB (cont'd)

Want to go for a walk?

KAREN

I don't believe it.

JACOB

It's true.  We're really doing it.

KAREN

But what if I'm just dreaming of you

telling me that?

JACOB

We'll compare notes when we wake up.

Then you'll know.

JACOB (cont'd)

Karen.  Wait.

JACOB (cont'd)

You have to be careful.

KAREN

Did you bring us here on purpose?  Can

you go anywhere you want?

JACOB

Sometimes.  It's not as easy as linking

up, though.

KAREN

Wow, I never knew...

KAREN (cont'd)

You know what I like to do in my dreams?

KAREN (cont'd)

I like to be other people!

KAREN (cont'd) (as fireman)

I can be anybody I want.

JACOB

Show off.

KAREN (AS REDHEAD)

When things get bad it helps to be

someone else.  I use it to protect

myself.

KAREN (cont'd) (as redhead)

What do you think?

JACOB

I think I like you the way you always

are.

JACOB (cont'd)

Much better.

KAREN

Look!

KAREN (cont'd)

I wonder where it goes?

JACOB

Karen, no!

JACOB (cont'd)

Karen!

CUT TO:

KAREN

Oh no...

FREDDY

Welcome to Romper Room!

KAREN

Why are you doing this?

FREDDY

Don't you remember?

JACOB

Come on!

JACOB (cont'd)

Wake up!

KAREN

What?

JACOB

You heard me.  I said wake up!

KAREN

How?  This is my old house.  How did I

get here?

KAREN (cont'd)

Why are you doing this to me?

JACOB

This is a dream!  You have to get out of

here.  I'm not hurting you, only he can

really do that!  Wake up now!

FREDDY

Gettin' kinky, huh?

KAREN

I think I get it now.

CUT TO:

KAREN

You hit me.

JACOB

Are you hurt?

KAREN

Um...no.

JACOB

If he had done it, you'd be dead.

KAREN

You better get back to your room.  We

don't want anybody to get the wrong idea.

JACOB

(smirks)

Or the right one?

KAREN

Get out of here.

JACOB

That's something else my mom taught me.

JACOB (cont'd)

Don't sleep.

KAREN

No.  Not tonight.

KAREN

I'm telling you, this Freddy guy is for

real.

SCOTT

And I'm telling you a dream is a dream.

KAREN

Jacob was in there with me.

SCOTT

And where else was he with you last

night?

JACOB

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

KAREN

I have the picture in my room if you want

to see it.  He brought it out from the

nightmare.

SCOTT

Or from your hope chest.  I bet your bed

isn't the only thing he's been into.

KAREN

That picture was destroyed years ago.

JACOB

You better watch your mouth, pal.

SCOTT

I'm the last person you want to start

fucking with.

JACOB

Go ahead and be a tough guy, Scott.

Krueger will cut you to pieces before you

can even flex a muscle.

GINA

Will you two stop it!  You're scaring the

shit out of me.

KAREN

You should be scared.

DAVID

Alright.  What's going on here?

SCOTT

Join the fun.  Jacob and Karen were just

telling us about their new excuse to

sleep together.

JACOB

Nothing happened between us last night.

SCOTT

You mean in plain old reality, right?

DAVID

Okay, everybody.  Out.  Jacob and I are

going to have a little talk.  Now.

DAVID (cont'd)

Your days are numbered here, buster.

JACOB

I'm sorry, but...

DAVID

Hey, I don't know what kind of shit

you're shoveling to these kids, but it's

going to stop.  My Good Samaritan

instincts have their limits.  We've had

enough tragedy around this place.  We

don't need you making things worse with

fantasies.

JACOB

You don't understand

DAVID

And I want you to stay away from Karen.

JACOB

It's a free country.

DAVID

This isn't America, it's my house.  I've

been checking up on you.  You have no

record with the police or the state or

any of the runaway groups.  You're the

invisible kid.  And if I sense even a

little bit more trouble-making from you,

you're going to vanish from here.  Got

it?

JACOB

Yes, sir.

JACOB

You're supposed to be off-limits to me.

KAREN

It's okay.  The Ross's have gone to a

council meeting and Scott's in his room.

We should be safe for awhile.

JACOB

Wonderful.

KAREN

Jacob, what are we going to do?

JACOB

I'm going to go to bed soon.

KAREN

Now you WANT to sleep?

JACOB

I have to find the Dream Police.  I think

I'm somehow their link to all this.  They

only seem to appear when I'm around.  You

woke me up before I had a chance to talk

to them last night.

KAREN

I'm sorry.  I was scared.

JACOB

your fault.  I have to ask them what

we're supposed to do to help them.  And

maybe I can protect Gina while I'm in

there.

KAREN

What about Scott?

JACOB

He's on his own.

KAREN

Oh...

JACOB

I don't mean to be cold,but we've done

everything to convince him.  Gina's too

scared to understand.  I think Freddy

will go after her next.

KAREN

What should I do?

JACOB

You have to stay awake.

KAREN

That's not going to be easy.  I'm half

asleep already.

JACOB

You have to try.

KAREN

I'd better get out of here.

JACOB

Okay.  Be careful.

KAREN

YOU be careful.  I'm not going anywhere.

FREDDY

Going up?

FREDDY (cont'd)

At your service.

GINA

You're not real!

FREDDY

Ah, but who is?

FREDDY (cont'd)

Fourth floor.  Overpopulation.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Eight floor - the morgue.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Time to go down, Gina.

FAT MAN

Hi there, princess.  Your mom's told me

all about you.

FAT MAN (cont'd)

She said you're even better than she is.

FAT MAN (cont'd)

Aw, come on.  I'm really a nice guy.  You

know what they say.  Inside every fat

person...

FREDDY

...is a maniac trying to get out!

FREDDY (cont'd)

Now it's time for YOU to put out, Gina.

ROOM SERVICE (O.S.)

Room service?

FREDDY

Huh?  I didn't order anything...

FREDDY (cont'd)

Maybe its complimentary champagne!

JACOB

Come on!

GINA

Let go of me!

JACOB

I'm here to help!

GINA

Let's get out of here.

POWER COP

Where'd he go?

SOUND COP

I thought you had him.

BLADE COP

Shit...

JACOB

No no no no!

JACOB (cont'd)

He's got Gina!

SOUND COP

Stand back.

JACOB

You let him get away!

SOUND COP

It's difficult.

POWER COP

He's been at this longer than we have.

BLADE COP

He can do anything.

SOUND COP

But we have to catch him in the act to

get him.

JACOB

What...there are rules to all this?

SOUND COP

They're not rules.

POWER COP

It's just the way it is.

BLADE COP

Jacob, we need you to bring the rest

together.

JACOB

The rest?  You mean the kids at the home?

BLADE COP

Yes.  We need as many of you as we can

get.  And you must bring them to

Springwood.

JACOB

How?

BLADE COP

You have the power to link your dreams

with other's.  Dream of Springwood, then

bring the rest with you.

SOUND COP

Living souls are what he thrives on.

Living souls are what we need to help

stop him.

POWER COP

Before it's too late.

BLADE COP

Before he takes everyone.

SOUND COP

And every THING.

FREDDY

Ah...alone at last.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Touching, isn't it?

JACOB

Gina!

KAREN

Is it an earthquake?

JACOB

No.  It's Freddy.

DAVID

Pack your bags, kids.

JACOB

You're kicking us out?

DAVID

No.  They're taking you away.  They say

it's for your own good.

KAREN

They can't do that.

DAVID

Yes, they can.  They consider Mary and I

possibly unfit to act as foster parents.

They're going to find temporary homes for

you until this mess is straightened out.

I'm so very sorry.

KAREN

No, please.

DAVID

They're not calling it an accident this

time.  They don't really know what to

call it.

SCOTT

What's going to happen to us?

DAVID

You'll be alright.

KAREN

What's going to happen to you?

DAVID

I don't know.  They're thinking of

pressing charges.

JACOB

Aw, Jesus...

DAVID

Come on.  A car from juvenile hall will

be here in an hour.

MR. SILVERMAN

I'm sure most of you know how this works

already.  You'll be assigned new foster

homes tomorrow afternoon.  Tomorrow

morning the police will be talking to you

regarding the matter at the old house.

KAREN

What about it?

MR. SILVERMAN

Anything you know.

SCOTT

Are we considered suspects?

MR. SILVERMAN

You'll talk to the police about that.

Don't worry.  We'll all try and work this

out.

KAREN

Will we be able to go back to the Ross's?

MR. SILVERMAN

I don't know.  You'll have a place to

stay in the mean time.

KAREN

Will we be together?

MR. SILVERMAN

No.  We don't have anybody willing to

take more than one person.  I'm afraid

you'll be split up.

SCOTT

Great...

MR. SILVERMAN

Hey, you can visit each other.  You'll be

in the same town.

JACOB

If it's still here.

KAREN

Jacob, what are we going to do?

JACOB

Nothing.

KAREN

What do you mean, nothing?

JACOB

It's over.  We're finished.  He's won.

SCOTT

Looks like your hero just gave up.

KAREN

How can you do this?

JACOB

Do what?  I'm not doing anything.

KAREN

Exactly.  After all we've been through

you just throw in the towel.  Why?

JACOB

Because we're fucked.  The last thing the

Dream Police told me was that they needed

all our help.  Together.  Even if we

weren't about to be split up there aren't

enough of us left to make a difference.

KAREN

How do you know that?

JACOB

I don't.  But, it's all just too much.

I've tried so hard and nothing's worked.

I'm spent.  I'm wasted.  I'm...I'm so

tired.

JACOB (cont'd)

I've had enough.

KAREN

So you're just going to give up?  I'll

bet that's something your mother never

taught you.

KAREN (cont'd)

We still have one night together.

JACOB

And we're not going to waste it.

KAREN

Scott, we need you.

SCOTT

Look, I don't know what's going on

anymore.  Two of my friends die and now

you tell me I have to drop into dreamland

with you guys to do battle with the dude

that did it.

JACOB

We'll have help.

SCOTT

Ah, yes.  I almost forgot.  The Sleepy

Squad.  Alright.  I'll make you a deal.

I told you I wouldn't believe this stuff

unless I saw it.  If I understand this

correctly, all I have to do is fall

asleep and you just whisk me into the

action.

JACOB

Right.

SCOTT

Okay.  If that happens, if both of you

show up in my dream, I'll help you out.

If nothing happens, then I'll get a good

night's sleep and laugh at you in the

morning.

JACOB

Fine.  You got a deal.  And you won't be

disappointed.

KAREN

I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's

dorm.  Will you be able to bring me in?

JACOB

I hope so.  Then I got to make sure we

all end up in Springwood.

SCOTT

The old stomping ground?

JACOB

Yeah.  Only right now it's not a very

pretty place.

KAREN

What do we do when we get there?

JACOB

Play it by ear.  And try and stay alive.

SOCIAL WORKER

Half hour til lights out, everyone.

JACOB

Off we go.

SCOTT

Into the wild black yonder.

SCOTT

Freddy Krueger.  Yeah, right.  Years ago

some sicko gets fried and now he comes

back to stick it to you when you're

snoozing.  Stupid bedtime story.

SCOTT (cont'd)

Hey, Mr. Creepoid, you still up?

(a beat)

Yo, Jacob?

SCOTT (cont'd)

Huh?

SCOTT

Oh, this is lovely.

BUM

Hey, buddy?

SCOTT

Yeah, what?

BUM

Can you spare some change?

SCOTT

Um, well, let me see...

SCOTT (cont'd)

Holy Jesus Christ.

SCOTT (cont'd)

I'll catch you next time, buddy.

KAREN

Scott!  You're here.

SCOTT

Yeah.  Fun town.  Talk to any of the

neighbors, yet? They're a swell bunch of

folks.

KAREN

Uh-huh.  Real friendly, too.

SCOTT

So this is a dream?

KAREN

And I'm in it with you.  Convinced?

SCOTT

Maybe I'm just dreaming bout being here

with you.  Wouldn't be the first time.

KAREN

Nope.  I tired that one already.  Doesn't

work.  Come on, we have to find Jacob.

KAREN

Jacob!  Thank God!

SCOTT

So this is the place, huh?

JACOB

I'm home.

KAREN

What now?

JACOB

Scott, are you with us?

SCOTT

A deal's a deal.

JACOB

Then we wait.

SCOTT

Whoa!

SCOTT (cont'd)

Nice outfits.

POWER COP

Is this all?

JACOB

All that's left.

SOUND COP

It'll have to do.

SCOTT

We can always come back later.  Like when

it's daytime.

POWER COP

It's always night here.

JACOB

What's the plan?

BLADE COP

We need you to draw him out.

SCOTT

Terrific.  We're supposed to be bait.

SOUND COP

Essentially.

JACOB

Then let's do it.

BLADE COP

Fan out.

JACOB

Oh no...

JACOB (cont'd)

Mom...

MUTANT BOUNCER

Two drink minimum.

SCOTT

Ah, that's okay.  I think I'm underage,

anyway.

MUTANT BOUNCER

Two drink minimum.

SCOTT

No, really.  I'm driving.

MUTANT BOUNCER

Two drink minimum.

MUTANT WAITRESS

Can I get you anything?

SCOTT

That's okay.  I'll just sit at the bar.

MUTANT WAITRESS

Alright, honey.  You call if you need

anything.

SCOTT

You bet.  You'll be the first to know.

BARTENDER

What'll it be?

SCOTT

Um, a beer, I guess.

BARTENDER

Go on.  Puts hair on your back.

SCOTT

And that's all?

SCOTT (cont'd)

That's okay, this'll be plenty.

BARTENDER

No charge.  Compliments of the man at the

end of the bar.

FREDDY

Welcome to my favorite haunt.

SCOTT

So you're the man.

FREDDY

At your service.

SCOTT

What's on your mind?

FREDDY

A deal.

SCOTT

A deal's what got me into this.

FREDDY

Bring Jacob to me.

SCOTT

What's in it for me?

FREDDY

Power.  You don't need to hang out with

those losers. You're a take-charge kind

of guy, Scott.  Like when you took charge

of your father.

SCOTT

Leave my father out of this.

FREDDY

I'll make you mayor of Rosedale.

SCOTT

After you make it look like this?

FREDDY

You can have Karen.

SCOTT

Alive?

FREDDY

Any way you want her.

SCOTT

(after a beat)

Okay.

FREDDY

Shake?

SCOTT

No thanks.  I trust you.

JACOB

Mother?

SCOTT

Mayor of Rosedale.

SCOTT (cont'd)

What a crock of shit.

SCOTT (cont'd)

Hey!  He's over here.  Yo!  Dream Police.

Hello!  Come on.  Move you collective

asses.

SCOTT (cont'd)

Never a cop around when you need one.

FREDDY

I hate a snitch!

SCOTT

Eat shit...

JACOB

Krueger...

FREDDY

Lighten up, bone brain.

MUTANT BOUNCER

Take it outside!

FREDDY

No more playing around.

SOUND COP

Kincaid!

FREDDY

Put a lid on it!

FREDDY (cont'd)

(smiling)

Ah... a girl after my own heart.

FREDDY (cont'd)

En guard, bitch

FREDDY (cont'd)

Touche.

JACOB

I'm sorry, Scott.

JACOB (cont'd)

Okay, I'm impressed

BLADE COP

You shouldn't be.

BLADE COP (cont'd)

This is what we were afraid of.

SOUND COP

He still exists.

JACOB

What!  How?

POWER COP

We're already dead, that's why he

couldn't destroy us.

BLADE COP

But he's not dead. He's not alive either.

He's something in between.

SOUND COP

He's not entirely part of reality or part

of dreams.  He's unique.

BLADE COP

WE can't kill him.

POWER COP

We can wail away on each other until

doomsday and not do any good.

JACOB

Then who's going to kill this fucker?

SOUND COP

YOU have to.

JACOB

How the hell am I supposed to do that?

BLADE COP

Krueger's power comes from his rage and

the souls of children.

POWER COP

You have to find the original source of

that rage and use it against him.

BLADE COP

This town in its present condition

encompasses all evils from all times in

its history.  The answer is here

somewhere...

JACOB

I think I know where...

BLADE COP

Jacob, wait.  We have to find him first.

JACOB

No time.  You guys find Karen!

KAREN

No more...

KAREN

Jacob!  You scared the shit out of me!

JACOB

The feeling is mutual.

KAREN

Where are the Dream Police?

JACOB

I told them to look for you.  What are

you doing here?  Don't you know what this

place is?

KAREN

I do now.  Look what I found.

JACOB

You've got to get out of here.

KAREN

Wait.  You have to see this.

JACOB

You don't understand.  The Police can't

kill Freddy.  They literally chopped each

other to pieces and he's still alive!

Now I'm supposed to figure out how to get

rid of him.

KAREN

But I think I found the answer.  Shut up

for a second and look at these.

JACOB

Okay, so he's a bad artist.

KAREN

No!  You told me Krueger's mother

committed suicide and no one knows who

his father was, right?

JACOB

Yeah...

KAREN

Freddy's been pushing all our buttons

with our pasts.  These are HIS past.

Don't you get it? HE was a foster child,

too!

KAREN (cont'd)

Someone had to have taken care of him.

This guy...he was Freddy's father.  Those

drawings...they were Freddy's childhood.

This house...it's where it all happened.

JACOB

But in reality Freddy hasn't lived here

for decades.

KAREN

Like you tried to tell me once before,

this is a dream.  Who knows why this is

all here.

JACOB

All evils from all times in history...

KAREN

And isn't this where it all started in

Springwood?  On Elm Street?

JACOB

But what does this do for us?

KAREN

There's got to be a way to use it against

him.

JACOB

Okay, but we're not going to stand around

here to figure out how. It's too

dangerous.

JACOB (cont'd)

Let's get out of this house.

JACOB (cont'd)

Thank God.  Freddy's going to show up any

minute.

JACOB (cont'd)

Where are the others?

FREDDY

Time to join your mommy.

KAREN

No no no no no no no...Jacob...

FREDDY

Young love...ha!

JACOB

Karen...dream...powers....

FREDDY

It's past your bedtime, young lady.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Aw, sweetheart.  This won't hurt a bit.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Come on.  Be Daddy's little girl.

KAREN'S FATHER

That's my baby.  That's Daddy's little

girl.

KAREN

Oh no...

KAREN'S FATHER

(Freddy's voice)

Now do you remember?

KAREN

You're NOT my father.

KAREN'S FATHER

But we're going to have the same fun!

KAREN'S MOTHER

That's enough!

KAREN

Mommy, no!

KAREN'S MOTHER

You're never going to touch her again!

KAREN'S FATHER

I'll touch what I want!

FREDDY

Be honored, bitch.  You're the last soul

I need.

JACOB

I'll be back...

FREDDY

I'll be waiting.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Where's my little pumpkin?

FREDDY (cont'd)

Play time is over, bitch.

VOICE

FREDERICK!

VOICE (cont'd)

Frederick!  What have you done?

FREDDY

Daddy?

MR. UNDERWOOD

Don't you "Daddy" me!

FREDDY

No, Daddy. Please...

FREDDY (cont'd)

Stop.  You're hurting me.  Stop.

FREDDY (cont'd)

Why, Daddy?  What did I do?

MR. UNDERWOOD

You took some things that don't belong to

you!

POWER COP

We gotta get outta here!

BLADE COP

It took a human touch.  It took knowing

HIS nightmare.  Goodbye, Karen.

WOMAN

You okay, honey?

KAREN

Yes.  I'm alright.

WOMAN

I've never seen you around.  Are you new

in town?

KAREN

Sort of.

WOMAN

Well then...

(she smiles)

Welcome to Springwood.

FADE OUT.
