JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK

Screenplay by

Kevin Smith

OVER BLACK WE SEE:

MOTHER

Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks

up the free cheese, 'kay?

MOTHER

This'll keep the sun out of your

eyes. You be good now.

MOTHER

Don't fucking move, you little shit-

machine. Mommy's gonna try to score.

PASSERBY

Excuse me--who's watching these

babies?

MOTHER

The fat one's watching the little

one.

PASSERBY

Oh, nice parenting.

(walking away)

Leave'em out here like that and see

what happens.

MOTHER

FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE!

PASSERBY

(waving her off)

Ah, keep on truckin'.

MOTHER

(to baby)

D'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me

how to fuckin' raise you?

Motherfucker, man! Who's he fucking

think he is? What's the worse fuckin'

thing could happen to you sitting

outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck!

BABY

Fuck, fuck, fuck...

DISSOLVE TO:

JAY

(as a chant)

--fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother

fuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother-

fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck,

noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed,

smoking weed, doing coke, drinking

beers!  Drinking beers, beers, beers,

rolling fatties, smoking blunts! Who

smokes the blunts? We smoke the

blunts!

TEEN 1

Lemme get a nickel bag.

JAY

Fifteen bucks, little man. Put the

money in my hand. If the money does

not show, then you owe-me-owe-me-

owe.

(changing up to Morris

Day)

My Jungle Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh!

I think I want to know ya', know ya'--

TEEN 1

(digging in pockets)

What the hell are you singing?

JAY

You don't know "Jungle Love"? That

shit is the mad notes. Written by

God Herself and handed down to the

world's greatest band--the

motherfucking Time.

TEEN 2

The guys in that Prince movie?

TEEN 1

Purple Rain.

TEEN 2

Man, that shit was so gay--fucking

eighties style.

JAY

Bitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind

word about The Time! Me and Silent

Bob modeled our whole fucking lives

after Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a

smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and

Tubby here's my black manservant!

RANDAL

What'd I tell you two about dealing

in front of the store? Drop the kid

and peddle your wares someplace else,

burn-boy.

(walking away)

And for the record, The Time sucked

ass.

JAY

Yo-youse guys wanna hear something

fucked up about him and the Quick

Stop guy?

RANDAL

Hey, can't we do something about

those two stoners hanging around

outside all the time?

DANTE

Why? What'd they do now?

RANDAL

I'm trying to watch Clash of the

Titans, and all I can hear is the

two them screaming about Morris Day

at the top of their lungs.

DANTE

I thought the fat one didn't really

talk much.

RANDAL

What, am I producing an A&E Biography

about 'em? I'm just saying they

shouldn't be loitering around the

stores like they do.

DANTE

Neither should you, but we let you

stay.

RANDAL

See, man--if you were funnier than

that, ABC never would've canceled

us.

DANTE

What?

RANDAL

Nothing.

TEEN 1

Two packs of Wraps.

(beat)

Yo--how was the service?

RANDAL

What service?

TEEN 2

The one at the Unitarian church where

you two got married to each other

last week.

RANDAL

What the hell are you talking about?

TEEN 1

Jay said you had a Star-Wars--themed

wedding and you guys tied the knot

dressed like storm troopers.

TEEN 2

Yeah. And he said you're the bitch

and you're the butch. Oh, sorry--the

Leia and the Luke.

DANTE

I'm the bitch?!

RANDAL

Well if we were gay, that's how I'd

see it.

DANTE

Would you shut up?!

TEEN 1

(to TEEN 2)

Holy shit, dude. The honeymoon's

over.

DANTE

We're not married to each other.

TEEN 1

Well, sure. Not in the eyes of the

state or any real church, Skywalker.

RANDAL

(heading for the phone)

That does it. I'm gonna do something

about those two. I shoulda done a

long time ago

TEEN 2

In a galaxy far, far away!

TEEN 1

(exiting)

May the Foreskin be with you. Hand

Jabba the Hutt.

RANDAL

(into phone)

Yeah, I want to report a couple of

drug dealers out in front of the

Quick Stop.

JAY

What the Fuck, Serpico? What'd we

do?

COP

We got a report that two guys were

hanging around outside the stores,

selling pot?

JAY

We don't smoke pot, yo.

TEEN 1

Here're the rolling papers you wanted

for your pot. And your change. Thanks.

(getting in Jay's

face)

And The Time sucks ass!

COP

No pot, hunh? What do you need this

for?

JAY

What?  I got a wiping problem. I

stick these little pieces of paper

over my brown-eye, and bam--no shit

stains in my undies.

(unbuttoning pants)

You don't believe me? Lemme show

you.

JAY

Just spread my cheeks a little and

you can see the fucking stink nuggets--

COP

Pull up your pants up sir, Now!

COP

Let's take a ride down to the station.

JAY

What? It's suddenly a crime to fart,

motherfucker?!

BRODIE (O.S.)

No fucking way!

BRODIE

Dante and Randal slapped you with a

restraining order?!

JAY

Judge said if we go within a hundred

feet of the stores, we get thrown

into County.

BRODIE

So you gonna abide by the court's

ruling or you gonna go Bandit--

Reynolds style?

JAY

Fuck yeah! You know what they make

you do in county? Toss the fucking

salad! I don't like this fuck's

asshole; I'm gonna do it for some

stranger?

BRODIE

I guess if you really wanted to hang

out in from of a convenience store,

you could just buy your own now--

what with all that money you guys

made.

JAY

Hell yeah, bitch.

(beat)

Wait a second--what money?

BRODIE

The money from the movie, dumb-ass.

JAY

What the fuck are you babbling about?

BRODIE

(pulling a bagged-and-

boarded issue down

from the wall)

The Bluntman and Chronic movie.

(dawns on him)

Oh my God--don't tell me you have no

idea there's a movie being made of

the comic you two were the basis

for.

JAY

What?! Since when?

BRODIE

Goddamit, man--

(taps his wrist)

Here's the pulse, alright. And here's

your finger--

(shoves his hand down

the back of his pants)

--far from the pulse, jammed straight

up your ass.

(extracts hand and

extends it to Jay)

Say--would you like a chocolate

covered pretzel?

BRODIE

You see, kids, if you read Wizard,

you'd know it's the top story this

month.  Check it out.

JAY

When the fuck did this happen?!

BRODIE

Well, after X-Men hit at the box

office, all the studios started buying

up every comic property they could

get their hands on. Miramax optioned

Bluntman and Chronic.

JAY

Miramax? I thought they only made

classy flicks like The Piano and The

Crying Game?

BRODIE

Yeah, well once they made She's All

That, everything went to hell. So

you're saying you haven't gotten a

cut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil

and Banky Edwards used to pay you

likeness rights for the comic book?

JAY

We haven't seen a fucking dime for

no movie!

BRODIE

Well boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think

Holden and Banky owe you some of the

proverbial phat cash. I mean they're

making a movie based on characters

that are based on you and Quiet

Robert.

JAY

It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a

pair of stupid-ass superheroes that

run around saying "Snitchy-Nitchies"

or something.

BRODIE

I believe it "Snootchie Boochies."

Regardless--you're getting screwed.

If I was you guys, I'd confront Holden

McNeil and ask him for my movie check.

JAY

Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid.

BRODIE

And on that note, we cue the music.

HOLDEN

Well! I have been waiting years to

do this.

(smiles)

Look at these morose motherfuckers

right here. Smells like someone shit

in their cereal. Bunngg!

JAY

What the fuck took you so long

answering your damn door? You trying

to talk another girlfriend of yours

into some of that gay-ass three-way

action with your buddy?

HOLDEN

No, I was just showering your mother's

stink off me after I gave her a quick

jump and sent her home. But now that

you mention it--

(to Bob)

Thanks, you know. You could've made

the moral of that story you told me

a bit more clear.

HOLDEN

So what brings you two dirt merchants

to my neck of the woods?

JAY

Oh, I'll tell you what our necks are

doing in your woods--

JAY

Where's our motherfucking movie check?

HOLDEN

You heard about that too, Hunh? Well,

I've got nothing to do with it. That's

Banky's deal. He owns the property

now. I signed my half of the Bluntman

and Chronic right over to him years

ago.

JAY

Why the fuck would you do a thing

like that?

HOLDEN

Because I'm almost thirty, for God's

sake--why on earth would I want to

keep writing about characters whose

central preoccupations are weed and

dick and fart jokes? You gotta grow,

man. Don't you ever want more for

yourself?

(off Silent Bob)

I know this poor, hapless sonovabitch

does. I look in his doe eyes and I

see a man crying out, "When, Lord?

When the fuck can your servant ditch

this foul-mouthed little chucklehead

to whom I am a constant victim of

his folly, and who bombards me and

those around us with grade-A

foolishness that prevents me from

even getting to kiss a girl? Fuck!

When?!

JAY

I'm the chucklehead? Fuck you--you're

the dumb-ass who gave away his comic,

and now you ain't got no fat movie

check neither.

HOLDEN

When you're right, you're right. I

wish I'd broken off a little piece

for myself. Because if the buzz is

any indication, the movie's gonna

make some huge bank.

JAY

What buzz?

HOLDEN

The Internet buzz.

JAY

What the fuck is the Internet?

HOLDEN

The Internet is a communication device

that allows people the world over to

bitch about movies and share

pornography with one another.

(off monitor)

Here's what we're looking for: "Movie

PoopShoot.com"

JAY

(to Bob)

"PoopChute." Yeaaahhh.

HOLDEN

This is a site full of militant movie

buffs: sad bastards who live in their

parents' basements, downloading

scripts and trading what they believe

to be inside info about movies and

actors they despise yet can't stop

discussing. This is where you go if

you wanna hear frustrated would-be

filmmakers mouth off with their two-

bit, arm-chair-director's opinions

on how they all could've made a better

Episode One.

HOLDEN

Here. This is about the Bluntman

movie.

(reading)

"Inside sources tell me Miramax is

starting production this Friday on

their adaptation of underground comic

fave Bluntman and Chronic."

JAY

Friday?! Shit. Does it say who's

playing us in the movie?

HOLDEN

No, but if it's Miramax, I'm sure

it'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.

They put'em in a bunch of movies.

JAY

Who?

HOLDEN

You know--the guys from Good Will

Hunting.

JAY

You mean the fucking movie with Mork

from Ork in it?

HOLDEN

Yeah, I'm not too big a fan either.

Though Affleck was the bomb in

Phantoms.

JAY

Word, bitch. Phantoms like a

motherfucker.

HOLDEN

Now down here is where you can gauge

the buzz. This is the Shoot Back

area. It's where people who read the

news get to chime in with their two

cents. Here's what a guy who goes by

the chick-magnet Net handle of "Wampa-

One" thinks about Bluntman and

Chronic.

(reading)

"Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid

alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only

work in small doses, if at all. They

don't deserve their own movie."

(to Jay)

He's got a point.

JAY

Fuck him. What's the next one say?

HOLDEN

(reading)

"Bluntman and Chronic is the worst

comic I ever read. Jay and Silent

Bob are stupid characters. A couple

of stoners who spout dumb-ass

catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech

and Chong or Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay

and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their

stupid asses."

JAY

Who the fuck said that shit?!

HOLDEN

A guy who calls himself "Magnolia-

Fan."  Check out what the guy after

him said: "Jay and Silent Bob are

terrible, one-note jokes that only

stoners laugh at.  They're fucking

clown shoes. If they were real, I'd

beat the shit out of them for being

so stupid. I can't believe Miramax

would have anything to so with this

shit. I, for one, will be boycotting

this movie. Who's with me?"

(leans back)

And then there are about fifty more

posts from people who agree to join

Spartacus-here's boycott of the flick.

JAY

(grimly)

I'm gonna kill all these fucks--

HOLDEN

Ah, let it go. Number one, they're a

bunch of jealous little dicks who

use the anonymity of the Net to insult

people who're doing what they wish

they were doing, and number two,

they're not really talking about you

guys--they talking about Bluntman

and Chronic.

JAY

But they said Jay and Silent Bob!

They used our real names. It doesn't

matter that there's a comic book

version of us and a real version,

'cause nobody knows we're real in

real life.

HOLDEN

Really.

JAY

Yeah! And all these people who read

that shit think the real Jay and

Silent Bob are a couple of faggots

'cause of that all these dicks are

writing about the comic book Jay and

Silent Bob! And maybe one night, me

and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch,

and she'll be like "Oooo! I want to

suck youse guys dicks off. What's

your names?"  And I'll be like, "Jay

and Silent Bob." And she'll be like,

"Oh--I read on the Internet that

youse guys were little fucking

jerkoffs."  And then she goes and

sucks two other guys's dicks off

instead! Well fuck that!  We gotta

put a stop to these hateful sonsa-

bitches before they ruin our good

names!

HOLDEN

First off, I don't know how good

your names really are. Secondly,

there's not much you can do about

stopping this bile. The Internet's

given everyone in America a voice,

and everyone in American has chosen

to use that voice to bitch about

movies. As long as there's a Bluntman

and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are

gonna have something negative to say

about it.  Jay steams, thinking.

Then, a light dawns on him.

JAY

But wait a second--if there wasn't a

Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no

one would be saying shit about Jay

and Silent Bob, right?

HOLDEN

They're not saying anything about

you now--they're talking about

fictional characters!

JAY

(oblivious to Holden;

to Bob)

So all we gotta do is stop 'em from

making the movie!

HOLDEN

Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of

thousands of dollars in royalties

you're due in the process. Are you

fucking retarded? Look, I'm probably

not alone in the opinion that this

flick is the worst idea since Greedo

shooting first. I mean, a Jay and

Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to

see that?

HOLDEN

But since it is happening, you might

as well just ignore the idiots on

the Internet, go find Banky, and get

your "motherfucking movie check." As

you so succinctly put it. That's

what's important here.

JAY

No, Holden McNeil--what's important

here is that there's a bunch of

motherfuckers we don't even know

calling us assholes on the Internet

to a bunch of teenagers and guys who

can't even get laid. Putting a stop

to that is the most important thing

we could ever do.

(off monitor)

When did it say they're making that

movie?

HOLDEN

They start this Friday.

JAY

So if today's Tuesday, that gives us--

(counts)

Eight days.

HOLDEN

It's more like three days.

JAY

Right. Three days to stop that stupid

fucking movie from getting made!

C'mon, Silent Bob--

JAY

We're going to Hollywood.

HOLDEN

Now that's what I call the Blunt

leading the Blunt.

JAY

Tickets? Since when did they start

charging for the bus?

JAY

Didn't we used to ride that shit to

school every day for free?

JAY

We in Hollywood yet?

DRIVER

It's a three--day ride to Los Angeles,

sir. We left twenty minutes ago.

JAY

I didn't ask you about Los Angeles.

I asked you about Hollywood.

DRIVER

Hollywood's in Los Angeles, sir.

JAY

Don't change the subject! Are we in

Hollywood yet or not?

DRIVER

Please sit down, sir.

JAY

Why don't you take your seat Ralph

Kramden--

JAY

I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't

shit to so on this bus.

JAY

I already did that. Twice.

JAY

Yo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.

CHILD

Leave me alone, little kid.

JAY

That fuck called me a little kid and

gave me the finger! Go kick his ass!

JAY

You're my muscle, ain'tcha?

JAY

So go open a can of whup-ass on that

little fuck, and get me his game!

JAY

You're one tough motherfucker, you

know that?

PASSENGER

They been in there going on half an

hour now! Two of them! Doing God

knows what!

DRIVER

This bus isn't moving another inch

unless you clear out of there right

now!

DRIVER

DO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR!

NOW!!

JAY

Um--I think something's burning back

here.

JAY

The whole fucking world's against

us, dude. I swear to God.

JAY

This sucks balls, man. How come we

ain't getting no rides?

VOICE

'Cause you're doing it all wrong.

GUY

You gotta induce the drivers a little.

JAY

Like how?

GUY

Like this.

JAY

Yeah, but what happens when you get

in the car, and you don't make with

the head? Don't they kick your ass

to the curb?

GUY

Sure--if you don't make with the

head.

JAY

Eww! You eat the cock?!?

GUY

Yeah. If it'll get me a few hundred

miles across country. I'll take a

shot in the mouth.

JAY

Yeah, but we ain't gay.

GUY

Well, neither am I. But have you

seen the price of bus tickets lately?

Shit--I don't wanna cough up two

hundred bucks just to get to Chicago.

JAY

Well, I don't wanna cough up some

dude's sperm!

GUY

Don't be so suburban--this is the

new millennium. Gay, straight--it's

all the same now. There're no more

lines.

JAY

There's one. On this side of it, we

ain't gay.

GUY

All hitchers do this. Why do you

think people pick us up? If you get

a ride, it's expected--I don't care

who the driver is. It's the first

rule in the Book.

JAY

What book?

GUY

The unwritten Book of the Road.

GUY

Follow the rules of the Book, and

you'll get where you're going in no

time.  Excuse me.

NUN

You two boys need a ride?

NUN

You both don't have to sit back there.

One of you can sit up here with me.

NUN

So where are you boys from?

JAY

New Jersey.

NUN

What brings you to Indiana?

JAY

We're going to Hollywood.

NUN

Hollywood, hunh? That's a long ways

away.

JAY

Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up.

NUN

Well, do unto others. That's what

the Book says.

JAY

(misinterpreting

completely)

Wait a minute--you follow the Book,

too?

NUN

I live my life by it.

JAY

Really? You?

NUN

Of course. You know how lonely it

gets on the road? Thanks to the Book,

I'm never alone--if you know what I

mean.

JAY

I guess. This guy back there explained

it to us. But I didn't think you'd

be into that.

NUN

Are you kidding? I've dedicated my

life to it. Every hour of every day.

JAY

Shit--you nuns are alright.

NUN

You live by the Book, too?

JAY

You picked us up, didn't you? I gotta.

NUN

That's good to hear. But it takes

deed, not words. It's a lot easier

to say you live by the Book than to

actually do it.

(looks at him)

Can you do it?

JAY

You want me to do it right now?

NUN

No time like the present, right?

JAY

Alright.

(he suddenly stops)

You hear that? She's not a Catholic.

She's a Presbyterian.

JAY

Dude--she had seventies bush.

JAY

I can't believe this shit. Five hours

and not a single ride. Every day,

millions of people hitch to Hollywood

and stop studios from making movies

about 'em. But when you and me try

it, it's like we're trapped in a

fucking cartoon!

JAY

Zoinks, yo

GUY

And now we can finally solve the

mystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls!

Pull off their masks and let's see

who they really are!

BOOKISH

I don't think they are masks.

BEAUTY

I don't think they're Hitchhiking

Girls either.

BOOKISH

Ghouls, you fucking moron. Not Girls.

(to herself)

Though I wish they were hitchhiking

girls. Sexy, skimpily clad hitchhiking

girls--

GUY

Let's kick them out. We've got a

mystery to solve.

DUDE

The only mystery here is why we take

our cues from a dick in a neckerchief!

GUY

Keep it up, Beatnik! I'll feed you

to the fucking dog!

BEAUTY

(covering her ears;

shrieking)

I CAN'T TAKE ALL THIS FIGHTING!

JAY

YO!

JAY

Youse guys need to turn those frowns

upside down! And we got just the

thing for that.

(pulls out a bag of

joints)

We call them Doobie Snax.

GREAT DANE

Ri, Ray rand Rirent Rob

JAY

Look at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's

got a stoner-boner!!!

BEAUTY

I think they passed out.

GUY

Great. What do we do with them now?

DUDE

Let's cut out their kidneys to sell

on the black market and leave them

in a seedy motel bathtub full of

ice.

BOOKISH

Oh God, not again?

JAY

Holy shit, I had a horrible dream.

(looks around)

Yo, I'm hungry. Where can we get

some breakfast?

JAY

Yo--check that shit out: the Internet.

Let's see if those fucks said

something new about us and that stupid

flick.

JAY

"Any movie based on Jay and Silent

Bob is gonna lick balls, because

they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely

each other's."

JAY

Eww.

(reading further)

"Yes--they are real people. Real

stupid people. Signed, Darth Randal."

(to Bob)

Motherfucker! It's time we wrote

something back! Type this shit down.

JAY

All you motherfuckers are gonna pay.

You are the ones who are the ball-

lickers.  We're gonna fuck your

mothers whole you watch and cry like

little bitches. Once we get to

Hollywood and find those Miramax

fucks who are making the movie, we're

gonna make 'em eat our shit, then

shit our shit, then eat their shit

which is made of our shit that we

made 'em eat. Then all you

motherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay

and Silent Bob.

JAY

That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat

our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get

back on the road, get to Hollywood,

and stop that fucking movie from

getting made. No more hairy-bush

nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye

on the prize, and not let nothing--

and I mean NOTHING--distract me.

GIRL

(off cup)

Oh my God. Do you get free refills

with that?

JAY

Oh, what--this? I just wear this for

protection. You know--so no guys try

to grab my shit.

GIRL

Hi. I'm Justice.

JAY

(dreamily)

And I am so fucking yours--

JAY

I mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my

hereto life-mate, Silent Bob.

JUSTICE

It's nice to meet you.

JAY

Justice, hunh? That's a nice name.

(under his breath, to

Bob)

Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F-

U-C-K-I-N-G--

(back to Justice)

So you come here often?

JUSTICE

Oh, I'm not from around here. My

friends and I are taking a road trip,

and we just stopped to grab something

to eat.

JAY

Your friends, hunh? Where they at?

JUSTICE

(pointing)

Out there. By that van.

JAY

Dude--I think I just filled the cup.

JAY

Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent

Bob are in the Hizz-ouse!!!

SISSY

Who the fuck are these guys?

JUSTICE

This is Jay and Silent Bob.

(to Jay and Bob)

Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and

Chrissy.

CHRISSY

Where the fuck did they come from?

JUSTICE

I met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch

a ride.

SISSY

I don't know if that's such a great

idea. Jussy.

JAY

Sure it is, Juggs.

MISSY

Oh my god--he just called Sissy

"Juggs"!

CHRISSY

I'm on it.

JUSTICE

Chrissy, no!

SISSY

We're in the middle of suburbia,

Chrissy. Let's try to act like it.

CHRISSY

And what-stupid ass little foul-

mouthed bitch-boys don't get their

balls cut off in suburbia?

JAY

(oblivious)

What's with the knife? We having

cake or something?

CHRISSY

Holy shit--he's retarded, to boot.

JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Yo--she called you retarded.

SISSY

(to Justice)

What's wrong with you, Justice? You

do remember where we're going, don't

you?

MISSY

That we do have a job to do?

JUSTICE

They're just gonna tag along for a

few miles. They won't get in the

way, I promise.

(cutesy)

Please?

SISSY

Fine--they can ride with us. But

they're so out of here before we get

to Boulder.

JUSTICE

Honest Injun.

CHRISSY

"Honest Injun"?

(to Sissy)

I can't believe what a pushover you

are.

JAY

And I can't believe fine-ass bitches

like yourselves eat that shit. Don't

you know fast food makes girls fart?

BRENT

Say--what's all this talk about

farting?

SISSY/CHRISSY/MISSY

Hi Brent!

SISSY

This is Brent. He's with us, too.

CHRISSY

Brent, tell these sillies that girls

don't fart.

BRENT

Of course they don't! Only skeevy

stoners fart.

BRENT

What up, homies?

(off the Girls)

Wow, Three guys, four girls--

(to Jay and Bob)

What's the count boys?

BRENT

Hey there mister science-guy. Don't

spray that aerosol in my eye. For I

don't really want to die. I'm a noble

rabbit!

JAY

What're you guys, like a cover band

or something?

SISSY

We're the Kansas State chapter of

S.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal

Cruelty.

CHRISSY

And we're on our way to Colorado to

give Provasik a piece of our minds!

JAY

What the fuck are you bitches babbling

about?

BRENT

Hey! Watch the language little boy.

There are females present.

JUSTICE

Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical

lab where they perform gross

experiments on animals.

JAY

So, what kind of animals are we

talking about here--like bears and

rhinos?

BRENT

No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats...

heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak

for them, who will?

(touches Justice's

arm)

Right, Jussy?

JAY

Hey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you

over here for a second?

JAY

Be honest, yo--you're down with this

for the fine-ass pussy, right?

BRENT

I'm down with this because I love

animals, stupid.

JAY

Even sheep?

BRENT

Of course. Sheep are beautiful

creatures.

JAY

They are beautiful, aren't they?

BRENT

Oh God, yes.

JAY

So then you'd fuck a sheep?

BRENT

What is your damage little boy? You've

got a sick and twisted world

perspective.

JAY

No, you misunderstand me, Prince

Valiant. I mean if you were another

sheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if

you were another sheep?

BRENT

I--suppose so.

JAY

That's what I thought.

(suddenly loudly, to

all)

YO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF

US! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP!

JAY

YA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!

CHRISSY

What the fuck are we gonna do now?

SISSY

Shut up, I'm thinking.

JAY

Is Hollywood near where we're going?

JUSTICE

Is that where you guys are from?

JAY

Ch'yeah, right. Jersey represent!

JUSTICE

Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you

all the way out here?

JAY

Well, we couldn't hang in front of

the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of

the strainen-en order, which sucks

ass 'cause it's been like our home

since we were kids. Silent Bob even

busted his cherry there.

JUSTICE

(to Bob)

You did? I'll bet she was a lucky

girl.

JAY

Look, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying

to tell a story here.

JUSTICE

Sorry.

JAY

Anyway, we were talking to Brodie

and he said there's gonna be a

Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we

went to see Holden McNeil, and he

showed us the Internet, and that's

where we found all these fucking

little jerkoffs were saying shit

about us. So we decided to go to

Hollywood and stop the movie from

getting made.  And now we're here.

JUSTICE

Wow. I have no idea what you just

said.

JAY

Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like

animals, huh?

JUSTICE

Sure.

JAY

That's cool. Even snakes?

JUSTICE

You can't exclude an animal just

because it's not cuddly. Of course I

like snakes.

JAY

How about trouser snakes?

JUSTICE

What's a trouser snake?

JAY DEVIL

(to Jay)

What the fuck are you waiting for?

She went for the setup! Reach in

your fucking pants, and pull yer

cock out, bitch! That's the kinda

shit girls like!

JAY DEVIL 2

Right about here's where the angel's

supposed to show up and tell you not

to pull your dick out. But we bitch-

slapped that little fuck and sent

him packing, so it's smooth sailing.

Let 'er rip, boy!

JAY ANGEL

Sorry I'm late. So what's the deal

here?

(looks down)

Oh, shit--you're not thinking of

whipping your dick out at this fine

piece of woman, are you?

JAY ANGEL

Tell you what: look at Silent Bob.

See if he thinks it's a good idea to

whip your dick out.

JAY ANGEL

That's it, boy--put the dick down.

You gotta go from the heart, yo. No

little perv bullshit will do for

this one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de

la Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the

shit out of two suckerpunching little

bitches. Remember--don't pull your

dick out until she asks you to.

(beat)

Or until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg!

The Jay Angel blinks away. Justice

looks at Jay, a bit confused.

JAY

Don't ask.

(beat)

So, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like

me do to help the animals?

JUSTICE

You really don't want to help us--

JAY

What the fuck are you talking about?

Sure I do. I'd do anything for you.

JAY

I mean, youse guys! I'd do anything

for youse guys. For the lift and

shit.

JUSTICE

You sure?

JAY

Sure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I.

Fuck

JUSTICE

Well--okay. Let me talk it over with

the other girls and get back to you.

JAY

You do that.

JAY

I'll be right here.

JAY

Fuck you. Fatty.

JUSTICE

You guys want anything from inside?

JAY

No, we're cool, thanks hon.

JAY

It just ain't the same, is it? This

place licks balls compared to Quick

Stop.

JAY

And speaking of licking balls--how

'bout that Justice chick? She is too

fine.  And she smells so fucking

pretty. She's got a nice voice, too.

And that body?  Smoking. You know,

she never once said "fuck off," when

I was talking to her, or pulled out

the pepper spray, or nothing. I tell

ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.

MISSY

Smooth move, Justice.

CHRISSY

(slapping Justice

upside the head)

Nice going, Four Eyes!

JUSTICE

Ow!

SISSY

Why the fuck did you let that little

stoner throw Brent our of the van?!

JUSTICE

Oh please--if I had to listen to one

more of those stupid songs, I was

going to throw him out myself.

SISSY

We needed Brent, Justice! He was our

patsy!

JUSTICE

We'll find someone else. Besides, I

didn't see you trying to stop Jay

from throwing him out.

SISSY

Because I didn't want to blow our

cover!

JUSTICE

Cover, shmover--you all hated his

songs, too.

CHRISSY

Not as much as I hate you.

CHRISSY

Fuck, if I don't get to kill someone

soon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone!

SISSY

(rubbing Chrissy's

shoulders)

Don't mind Chrissy. She's just a

little too wound for sound.

CHRISSY

Then how about you help me take the

edge off?

JUSTICE

(to Customers)

They're really good friends.

SISSY

(TO CHRISSY AND MISSY)

Would you two knock it off? We're in

the fucking heartland here! Try to

blend!

JUSTICE

They already do--she's the milkmaid,

and she's the cow.

CHRISSY

Oh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow,

bitch. And now I'm gonna rip your

head off and fuck your spine stump.

SISSY

Enough!

(calm to Justice)

We have a very simple gang here,

Justice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's

the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl.

But lately, I'm having a hard time

figuring out what you're doing here.

JUSTICE

That makes two of us.

CHRISSY

Shit--your name doesn't even fit the

rhyme scheme.

JUSTICE

That's because very few names rhyme

with "douchebag."

CHRISSY

(getting in her face)

You're dancing on my last nerve,

Strawberry Shortcake.

(to Sissy)

You deal with the weak link. I'm

gonna take Missy into the dirty

convenience store bathroom and hate-

fuck the shit out of her.

JUSTICE

And you said letting them read all

that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to

anything.

SISSY

Don't change the subject. You know

what you have to do now, right? Since

you let our patsy slip away, you've

gotta convince the little kid and

that fat guy to take his place.

They've gotta break into Provasik

now.

JUSTICE

Uh-uh!

SISSY

Uh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out

of this gang. Just use the little

one's crush to convince him, since

he's so fucking in love with you.

JUSTICE

Jay? No he's not.

SISSY

What--am I blind? He wasn't kissing

your hand back in the van like he

was fucking Lord Byron?

JUSTICE

Well, maybe he was just raised with

manners.

JAY

(to exited Girl)

YO, BABY! YOU EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE

LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?!

(to Bob)

Yeah.

SISSY

You're the one that brought the kid

in, Jussy. So you've gotta make

amends.

JUSTICE

Jay is not taking Brent's place as

the patsy.

SISSY

That kid and his quite friend are

our only options at this point. Now

we got about two hours before we get

to Boulder. That gives you plenty of

of time to work on him.

JUSTICE

I'm not gonna do it.

SISSY

Why the fuck not?

JUSTICE

Because he's just to so innocent!

JUSTICE

Look at him--

JAY

I'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little

asshole! Finger-bang and tea-bang my

balls--in her mouth! Where? Where?

In her mouth--balls-a-plenty in her

mouth!  Balls, balls, sweaty balls--

SISSY

Who's it going to be, Jussy--him or

us?

JAY

Steal a monkey? Shit--no problem.

JUSTICE

It's not really stealing--it's

liberating it, and--

(finally hears him)

Wait a second--did you say, "No

problem"?

JAY

Yeah, Fuck--we steal monkeys all the

time.

(to Bob)

Right, Lunchbox?

JUSTICE

It's not like it's a bad thing. It's

for a good cause.

JAY

Oh, it for the best cause, mon cheri--

(takes her hand)

The cause of love.

(kisses her hand,

then releases)

Snoogans--

JUSTICE

What the heck is that?

JAY

What's what?

JUSTICE

"Snoogans," I believe it was.

JAY

What the fuck do you think it means?

It means "I'm kidding."

JUSTICE

Ohhh. Well, that's too bad.

JAY

(singing)

I can't believe I'm gonna get some

pussy for stealing a monkey!

(speaking)

If I'd known it was that easy, I'd've

been stealing monkeys since I was

like seven and shit.

JAY

Don't, motherfucker. Don't you ruin

this for me. Me and Justice are gonna

get married one day, so don't be

giving me that "we-ain't-stealing-no-

monkey" look.  I'm Morris Day; you're

Jerome, bitch. Don't forget that.

That girl? That girl's in love with

me.

JUSTICE

They're gonna do it.

SISSY

Good. They do their part--

(pats a video camera)

And we'll do ours.

JUSTICE

Remember--we meet back here when

you're done. You sure you're okay

with this?

JAY

As sure as I am that you're the

hottest bitch I ever seen.

JAY

What's twisting that bitch's tits?

JUSTICE

Maybe it's because women don't like

to be called "bitches," Jay.

JAY

They don't? Well how 'bout "piece of

ass"?

JUSTICE

How about not.

JAY

Well, what the fuck am I supposed to

call you, then?

JUSTICE

Something sweet, you big goof.

Something nice.

JAY

(thinks; then)

Boo-boo kitty fuck.

JUSTICE

(laughing)

Okay.  That's a start.

SISSY

Jay, before you go, could you say

something into the camera about the

clitoris.

JAY

What?

JUSTICE

(to Sissy)

Man you are such a bitch--

SISSY

(off Justice; to Jay)

She's just a little embarrassed.

See, Jussy and I are putting together

this documentary for our Human

Sexuality class, and we need a male

perspective on the clitoris.

JAY

The female clitoris?

SISSY

Uh--yeah.

JUSTICE

Jay, you don't have to do this.

JAY

Nah, it's cool, hon. There's a few

things I can say about the clit that

I's like you to hear.

(clears throat; into

camera)

I am the master of the clit! I make

that shit work! It does what ever

the fuck I tell it to do!  No one

rules the clit like me!

(off Silent Bob)

Not this little fuck! None of you

little fucks out there! I am the

clit commander!!! Remember that--

commander of all clits!

SISSY

Awesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger.

JAY

(to Justice)

So--can I get a little kiss for good

luck?

JAY

So--can I get a little blow job for

good luck?

SISSY

Jussy. C'mon.

SISSY

Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my

authority again, you lose your fucking

fronts, you got that?

JUSTICE

Yes, sir.

SISSY

Phase One, down. While we're executing

Phase Two, you edit that tape and

grab a new car.

MISSY

No sweat.

SISSY

Let's suit up.

JAY

You fat fuck--

SISSY

They in?

MISSY

You can say that.

SISSY

Time to shine. Let's go.

JUSTICE

You are so gay.

SISSY

Once we're inside, I want complete

silence.

(holding up high-tech

device)

Missy whipped this up. It counts our

decibel level. If it goes into the

red--alarm, we're dead. So not even

the slightest noise, got it?

SISSY

(pokes her head back

out)

Justice! Move your ass!

JAY

Stay frosty, you big fucking softie.

We've got a job to do.

JAY

Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal

tranquilizer. This shit fucks you up

like Percocets!

JAY

Hold this. Later, me and Justice can

shoot each other with it and fuck

like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg.

JAY

(reading)

"Suzanne." Boo-yah.

CHRISSY

Holy fuck--the little stoner was

right--

CHRISSY

Boom Box!

SISSY

I can't believe it. Months of planning

and it's all blown by a fucking fart.

JUSTICE

We can't just leave them like this!

That alarm's gonna bring the cops

here any minute!

SISSY

That was always the plan, Justice!

They take the heat off of is long

enough until we can get out of town!

CHRISSY

Kaboom, you little stoner fucks.

CHRISSY

It's set. Let's roll.

JAY

What the fuck are you looking at?

There ain't no snacks here, man! Now

we got what we came for, so let's

get the fuck out!

JAY

Yeah, it's sad! But what the fuck

are we supposed to do about it?

JUSTICE

JUSTICE! OPEN THE DOORS!

JAY

Oh shit--

COP

DROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS

EXPLOSIVE!

JAY

Justice--

JAY

JUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!!

DEPUTY

Oh, fudge...

(calling off)

Marshal Willenholly!

WILLENHOLLY

Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby--

It takes two hands to hold doesn't

it--?  Uhhh--

WILLENHOLLY

WHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING!

DEPUTY (O.S.)

Sir, we got a report of a break-in

at Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing

lab.

WILLENHOLLY

Have you read this article on the

mule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I

wish that was in our jurisdiction--

I'd shut down every last one of those

ass-cock chuggers, personally.

WILLENHOLLY

What? "Ass" means "donkey."

DEPUTY

Yes, sir.

(hands him a fax)

WILLENHOLLY

(looks at fax)

Boulder, hunh? Well, gas up the jet.

DEPUTY

We don't have a jet, sir. And

Boulder's only ten minutes away.

WILLENHOLLY

Then gas up the next best thing.

WILLENHOLLY

My, oh my, oh my. Who let the cats

out?

(thinks)

Wait--is that right?

COP 1 (O.S.)

Excuse me--who the hell are you?

WILLENHOLLY

Federal Wildlife Marshal. This

investigation is now under my

jurisdiction.

COP 1

Oh really? And why is that?

WILLENHOLLY

Because someone let a whole mess of

animals out of their cages, sir.

COP 1

Well, we believe that was just a

diversionary tactic used to call

attention away from the real heist

over here at the Diamond Exchange.

WILLENHOLLY

Yeah, right. That's a believable

scenario. It sounds more like

something out of a bad movie.

COP 2

Sir, the Provasik people say they've

rounded all their animals up, except

for one: an orangutan.

WILLENHOLLY

Listen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our

fugitive has been on the run for 6

hours!  Average simian foot speed

over uneven ground--barring injuries

or preoccupation with tire tubes,

mites or bananas--is four miles an

hour. That gives us a radius of twenty

miles.

COP 3

(calling out from

crowd)

Twenty-four, sir!

WILLENHOLLY

What?

COP 3

Six hours times four miles an hour

is twenty-four.

WILLENHOLLY

(doing the math in

his head)

Yes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty-

four miles. Now what I want out of

all of you is a hard target search.

COP 4

Excuse me, sir?

WILLENHOLLY

Yeah?

COP 4

What does that mean, exactly--a "hard

target search"? What's a "hard

target"?

WILLENHOLLY

Well. It's--a target--that's--hard.

Anyway--

COP 4

So are you referring to the search's

level of difficulty? Or is the hard

target the monkey?

COP 3

Or the people who stole the monkey?

WILLENHOLLY

Okay, how about this? What I want

out of all of you is a thorough search

of every gas station, residence,

warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,

outhouse, and doghouse in that area!

Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!

COP 1

Wouldn't it make sense to put them

up at every twenty-four miles--seeing

as that's how far they'd have gotten

in the last six hours?

WILLENHOLLY

This is so frustrating. It's just so

hard sometimes--

(yelling)

YOUR FUGITIVE'S NAME IS SUZANNE! GO

FIND HER!

COP 5

Sir, this was just delivered to the

station.

WILLENHOLLY

What is it?

COP 5

It's a tape from the terrorists who're

claiming credit for the break-in.

WILLENHOLLY

Is it VHS or Beta? You know what--

never mind. Do you have a VCR?

WILLENHOLLY

Oh my God--

(without looking up)

Have the jet gassed up and ready to

go at a moment's notice.

COP

Sir, we don't have a jet; just a

helicopter.

WILLENHOLLY

(dialing his cell

phone)

Doesn't anybody have a jet anymore?

(into cell phone)

Plafsky? It is Willenholly. You gotta

get me on the national news, pronto.

Why?!  Because we may very well be

dealing with the two most dangerous

men on the planet!

JAY

This is Jussy's monkey

(to Suzanne, angrily)

JUSTICE DIED FOR YOU, YOU MONKEY

FUCK!

JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Do something. Tons of Fun!

JAY

Is that fucking thing waving at us?

JAY

Holy shit? That monkey understood

us! Maybe it's some sort of super-

monkey!

JAY

What the fuck was that for? It's not

a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo?

JAY

You're my bitch. You get my back.

Don't go joining this chimp's side.

JAY

Yo--what if there's more super monkeys

up in the lab? Maybe they're making

an army of 'em up there! Holy shit!

Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the

X-Files Roswell--style!

JAY (V.O.)

Working in secret with a crew of

double-dealing, nicotine-fiending

fucks that're selling out the human

race, these supermonkeys will use

simian science and their genius IQ's

to make man and monkey alike believe

that they're the superior species!

JAY (V.O.)

Then all it'll take is one little

monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the

dumber chimps into a frenzy, until

they go all ape-shit and start

demanding more bananas, better pay,

and human flesh!

JAY (V.O.)

You'll have to be faster than Walt

Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior

gorillas, who hunt humans for sport,

profit, and the occasional inter-

species blow-job. And if you don't

wind up with a monkey hog in your

mouth, you'll be captured, killed or

worse...

JAY (V.O.)

Eaten alive!

JAY (V.O.)

Then these monkey fucks'll start

wearing our clothes and rebuilding

the world in their image.

JAY (V.O.)

And only those who outwit those damn

dirty apes'll ever remember that it

was MAN who once ruled the earth!

JAY

(at statue)

YOU MANIACS! DAMN YOUSE!!! GODDAMN

YOUSE ALL TO HELL!!!

WE DISSOLVE FROM THIS IMAGE TO:

JAY

Not on my watch, motherfucker!

JAY

DIE, YOU SUPER-MONKEY FUCK! DIE!!!

JAY

Alright--you can live. For now.

JAY

You see that? Bitches love me.

(heading off)

Besides--we're in the fucking clear,

yo. It's not like anyone knows we

stole the monkey.

ANCHORMAN

I'm Reg Hartner and this is a News

Now bulletin. A Provasik animal

testing facility in boulder was the

focus of an attack by a terroristic

primate rescue syndicate calling

themselves the Coalition for

Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers.

Or simply, C.L.I.T.

ANCHORMAN

In a videotape sent to authorities

this morning, credit for the

liberation of an orangutan from the

lab last night is taken by these men--

ANCHORMAN

--identified in literature that

accompanies the tape as Jay and Silent

Bob. In this chilling clip, they

make it very clear that they are in

control of the C.L.I.T.

DIGITIZED VOICE

We are the C.L.I.T. None of you are

safe. Now tremble before the might

of our merciless leader.

JAY

I AM THE CLIT COMMANDER!!!

ANCHORMAN

Terrifying. Here to help us understand

this footage is Federal Wildlife

Marshal Willenholly.

ANCHORMAN

Marshal, what can you tell us about

the C.L.I.T.?

WILLENHOLLY

From the intelligence we've been

able to gather, we've discovered

that the C.L.I.T. is a tiny offshoot

of the L.A.B.I.A.

ANCHORMAN

The Liberate Apes Before Imprisoning

Apes movement.

WILLENHOLLY

Exactly. The men you saw in the video

are believed to be the masterminds

responsible for the frenzied C.L.I.T.

activity last night. They go by the

obvious code names "Jay" and "Silent

Bob."

(to camera)

If you should come across them or

any other C.L.I.T.-ies, please--

exercise extreme caution.

ANCHORMAN (O.S.)

(from TV)

Marshal, how do you respond to

allegations that Federal Wildlife

Marshal's Office allowed the C.L.I.T.

to slip through their fingers?

WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)

Nonsense. We're all over the C.L.I.T.,

Reg.

HOLDEN

(shakes his head)

Nights like this, I miss dating a

lesbian.

ANCHORMAN (O.S.)

(from TV)

Is there also speculation that Jay

and Silent bob may be responsible

for the Diamond Exchange jewel heist

that occurred in the same vicinity

of downtown Boulder last night?

WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)

There's nothing to suggest that, no.

But these men are still to be

considered very dangerous.

RANDAL

(to Dante)

I told you that restraining order

was a good idea.

ANCHORMAN

(on TV)

Is that your cell phone?

WILLENHOLLY

(on TV)

Yes, Excuse me.

(on TV, into cell

phone)

Federal Wildlife Marshal. I'm on my

way!

(shuts phone; to

anchorman)

We got 'em. They're in Utah.

(to camera)

Citizens of Utah--steer clear of the

C.L.I.T. Stimulation of the C.L.I.T.

is not recommended.

JUSTICE

Your tape worked. The news is all

about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik

break-in, with almost no mention of

the Diamond heist.

SISSY

(yelling down to

Justice)

I told you those two were the perfect

patsies. Now we lay low for awhile--

just in case--and start planning the

next job.

JUSTICE

Don't you feel any regret? Jay and

Bob don't deserve this. They were

really sweet.

CHRISSY

The only thing I regret is not gutting

that little trout-mouthed prick like

a fish and playing Twister with his

vitals.

MISSY

You are so nasty.

CHRISSY

I'll show you nasty, you little slut.

SISSY

Would you two get a room?

CHRISSY

Fine--we'll take yours.

(getting up in Sissy's

face)

I am gonna stain your sheets, bi-

otch.

SISSY

Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure.

JUSTICE

They're your gang.

SISSY

Oh and not yours? You know, I don't

get you, Justice. You used to be all

about the girl stuff: stealing,

boning, blowing shit up. Now you're

like this little priss with a

conscience. It's really a fucking

drag.

JUSTICE

We all gotta grow up some time.

SISSY

If moping around over some little

boy you're crushing on is being grown-

up, then pass me my Wonder Woman

underoos.

JUSTICE

Don't you feel the least bit of guilt

for what we did to those guys?

SISSY

Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty

about setting up her boyfriend? Then

how about taking a shower?

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY

You the gals that ordered the pizzas?

SISSY

This dopey bitch ordered the large

plain, but I could go for some hot,

thick, Sicilian.

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY

No charge, lady.  He rushes into the

motel, Justice sighs, looking up at

the stars.

JUSTICE

(quietly)

I'm sorry, Jay.

JAY

You know, Justice died trying to

save this monkey, so maybe we should

keep her around. That way, we can

honor her memory.

JAY

Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing

all sentimental, and you're all about

a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't

you glad we stopped to eat?  And you

were all piss-scared the cops'd bust

us or something. You know what I

say?

(singing, a la NWA)

VOICE (O.S.)

(via bullhorn)

THIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE! WE

KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE COME OUT WITH

YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND SURRENDER

THE ORANGUTAN!

JAY

You think they're talking to us?

SHERIFF

YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY.

(to other COPS)

Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty.

SHERIFF

The ape.

WILLENHOLLY

What?

SHERIFF

An orangutan's a member of the great

ape family. It's not a monkey.

WILLENHOLLY

Look, who's the Federal Wildlife

Marshal here?

(into bullhorn)

JAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL

WILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR

C.L.I.T.  DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.

SURRENDER THE MONKEY IMMEDIATELY,

AND YOU WON'T GET SHOT!

JAY

What the fuck are you waiting for?

Go out there and give 'em the monkey.

JAY

Oh, what, man? I said that shit before

I knew they were gonna shoot us!

Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't

takin' no bullet for no monkey!

JAY

Oh, brother--this is like something

out of fucking Benji! Look man, maybe

it's not that bad back at the lab!

Maybe they experiment on 'em by,

like making 'em fuck a bunch of

different, good-looking monkeys. We

don't know! Maybe they got it real

sweet!

JAY

(to Suzanne)

You stay out of this, you weepy little

chimp!

(looks around thinking)

Fuck man, I ain't no strategist!

You're the guy that makes the

blueprints! I don't even have the

fucking smarts of a little--

JAY

--kid

WILLENHOLLY

ANYONE NOT HARBORING A FUGITIVE MONKEY

BETTER HIT THE DECK!  WE'RE GOING TO

OPEN FIRE!

(to cops)

Everyone has bullets in their guns,

right?

JAY

Don't shoot! We're just trying to

take our son out of this hostile

environment!

SHERIFF

Their "son"?

WILLENHOLLY

Maybe they're one of those gay

couples?

JAY

Yeah! We're gay! And this is our

adopted love child! We're not from

around here!  Don't make us go back

to our liberal city home with a tales

of prejudice and bigotry in the heart

of Utah!

(whispers to Bob)

You see the shit I gotta put up with

for you! Now I got this guy thinking

I'm gay!

WILLENHOLLY

Oh God, this is the last thing I

need--a bunch of uppity homosexuals

shooting their mouth off in the

liberal press that the Federal

Wildlife Marshal's Office persecutes

gays.

SHERIFF

ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY! THOSE TWO MAY

BE GAY, BUT THAT AIN'T THEIR SON!

THAT'S THE APE!

WILLENHOLLY

You see this badge?  I think I'd

recognize an ape if I saw one. And

the only thing I do recognize here

is a political fiasco I'm, going to

avoid by letting this butt-fucking

Brady Bunch go!

JAY

And I'll tell you another thing:

what if that guy shows up around the

stores one day and starts telling

everybody you and me are poo-gilists?

How are we gonna get any pussy then,

hunh?

WILLENHOLLY (V.O.)

YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE, SIRS!

WILLENHOLLY

(via bullhorn)

YES, YOU, SIRS.

JAY

(calling over)

So we can just go?

WILLENHOLLY

(via bullhorn)

Yes, sir--or ma'am. Please accept my

apologies for detaining you and your

unorthodox-but-constitutionally-

protected-family unit.

SHERIFF

(amazed)

Un-fucking believable.

JAY

I'd like to offer a big gay thank-

you, sir. We'll tell all our gay

friends that Utah is Gay friendly

country for gays who are gay.

WILLENHOLLY

I'm sure Utah appreciates that. You

might also want to make it clear

that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's

Office is also pro-'mo as well.

(winks at the sheriff)

And might I add, that's one fine-

looking boy you're raising.

JAY

Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm.

See, I knocked up a hot woman friend

of ours who I also fuck on the side.

So as not to be all-the-way-gay. But

my tubby husband here is one hundred

percent queer. He loves the cock.

WILLENHOLLY

He certainly looks insatiable.

JAY

'Bye

WILLENHOLLY

'Bye

WILLENHOLLY

Well, it's not my way--but damned if

there doesn't go one happy family.

(balloon two)

Now, we just shoot some tear gas

into that diner, and when the two

guys run out with the monkey, we'll--

WILLENHOLLY

That was the them, wasn't it?

JAY

I said you "love the cock"! I gotta

be the craftiest motherfucker alive!

JAY

FLEE, FAT-ASS, FLEE!!!

JAY

HEAD FOR THE SEWERS!

JAY

Take your stinking paws off me, you

damn dirty ape!

(yelling up)

YO LUNCHBOX! HURRY UP!

JAY

You fat fuck.

JAY

You just--had to--order pancakes--

didn't ya?

WILLENHOLLY

Fire a warning shot into that bulbous

ass!

SHERIFF

One rectal breach, coming up!

JAY

SUCK IT IN! THINK THIN! THINK THIN!!!

SHERIFF

Open up and say "ahhhhh," you stoner

sumbitch--

SILENT BOB

AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

JAY

INCOMING!!!

SILENT BOB

AAAIIIGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!

SUZANNE

OOOOOOOOO!!!

JAY

Just like Winnie-the-Pooh.

WILLENHOLLY

Wow! That was an incredibly daring

escape!

(to Sheriff)

You must see that a lot, hunh?

SHERIFF

Shut up!

WILLENHOLLY

Sire, you're very taciturn.

WILLENHOLLY

You and your men stay up here. When

I corner them, I'll call you for

back-up.

SHERIFF

What're you doing? They're trapped.

The only way they can get out of

there is right here.

WILLENHOLLY

A Federal Wildlife Marshal doesn't

wait for his prey to come to him. He

comes to it. Or goes to it. Is it

"comes to it" or "goes to it"?

(shakes it off)

I'm going in there. I'm counting on

you Sheriff.

WILLENHOLLY

You've taught me so much.

SHERIFF

Fuck this asshole. Let's go back to

the station and get some donuts.

JAY

This reminds me of the night I fucked

your mom, yo. One big-wet, smelly,

gaping hole, and me wishing I had a

board tied to my ass--

JAY

--to keep from falling in.

WILLENHOLLY

PUT THE MONKEY DOWN AND YOUR HANDS

UP!

WILLENHOLLY

MISTERS, DO YOU WANNA GET SHOT?!?

JAY

LOOK MAN--SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO

BACK! THEY'RE EXPERIMENTING ON HER!

(beat)

AND FOR THE RECORD, I AIN'T REALLY

GAY!

WILLENHOLLY

I DON'T CARE!

(beat)

AND FOR THE RECORD, I KNEW THAT WASN'T

REALLY A LITTLE BOY.

JAY

SURE, FOR ONE MORE RECORD--

(pointing to Silent

Bob)

HE LOVES COCK!

WILLENHOLLY

ON YOUR KNEES!

JAY

See, man?! He's lining us up like

fucking circus seals! Well, I'm going

first--I don't want no mouthful of

monkey-spit when I gotta blow this

fucking G-Man.

JAY

GET OFFA ME!!! GET OFFA ME!!!

JAY AND BOB

AAAAIIIGGGGGHHHHH!!!

WILLENHOLLY

Oh, no--think you can pull a Peter

Pan on me?!

WILLENHOLLY

AAAIIIGGGGHHHHH!!!

JAY

HEY LAW-DOG! SEE YOU IN HELL, COCK--

SMOKER!!!

JAY

You see that shit? Damn--remind me

not to get on the monkey's bad side.

Yo--boost her up. So we can talk, so

we can get the fuck out of here.

JAY

HEY! GET THE FUCK OFF HER, MAN! THAT'S

MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S MONKEY?!

JAY

Man! Who the fuck just steals a

monkey?!

JAY

Oh yeah.

(pissed)

Well this fucking blows! We got one

more day to stop those fucks from

making that movie, and someone goes

and takes the only thing I had left

from the one woman I ever loved enough

NOT to try to stick my hand down her

pants!

JAY

Go after the monkey? How the fuck

are we supposed to know where that

thing's going?

JAY

What? What is that supposed to mean?!

Don't just fucking point like--

(imitates him)

You ain't the broad in the Children

of a Lesser God. Use you fucking

mouth for more than eating, ya tubby

bitch!

JAY

You gotta take a shit? No--you gotta

take a salad? Take a salad? What the

fuck are you trying to say?

JAY

JUST FUCKING SAY IT ALREADY?!?

SILENT BOB

THE SIGN ON THE BACK OF THE CAR SAID

CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD, YOU DUMB

FUCK!!!

JAY

Say it, don't spray it, bitch.

SHERIFF (O.S.)

"And might I add, that's one fine-

looking boy you're raising."

SHERIFF

Well, if it isn't the wildlife

experts. Did you come to it or go to

it?

WILLENHOLLY

Do you have a microwave here, Sheriff?

SHERIFF

We have a toaster oven. Why?

WILLENHOLLY

Because I need to dry my gun out so

I can SHOOT YOU WITH IT ! TWICE!

SHERIFF

This might cheer you up.

(hands him paper)

Your office just faxed this over.

Guy there say it's a post from an

Internet chat board, signed by a

"Jay and Silent Bob." Your man thinks

it's a lead as to where those fellas

are taking the ape.

WILLENHOLLY

(reading)

"All you motherfuckers are gonna

pay. You are the ones who are ball-

lickers.  We're gonna fuck your

mothers while you watch and cry like

little bitches. Once we get to

Hollywood--"

(looks up)

They're going to Hollywood.

JAY

What? It's not like it's cheating.

Justice blew up.

HOOKER 1

Hey, little man. You want some of

this?

HOOKER 2

How about you, Big Boy?

HOOKER 1

If you've got fifty bucks we can get

nasty.

JAY

Oh yeah? How nasty?

HOOKER 2

As nasty as you wanna be, poppie.

JAY

Alright--first, I'll want to tongue

your bung while you juggle my balls

in one hand and play with my asshole

with the other. But don't stick you

finger in.  Then. I'll wanna pinky

you and put it in your friend's brown,

while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie

cup. After that, I'll wanna smell

your titties, for a while, and you

can pull my nutsack up over my dick,

so it looks like a Bullfrog. Then I

want you to flick at my nuts while

your friend spanks me into the same

Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in. Then

we throw the Dixie cup out.

HOOKER 1

Oh, that's it honey. I quit.

(walking away)

This job just passed the point of no

return.

HOOKER 2

(to Jay)

You one fucked up puppy, poppie.

JAY

(watching them go)

What?! You said 'nasty'?

(shakes his head; to

Bob)

Man, chicks in Hollywood are so stuck

up.

JAY

Alright, here's the plan: first, we

find out where they're shooting that

movie at. After we shut that shit

down, we can start looking for the

monkey. But before we do any of that

shit, we gotta find a motherfucker

in the know. Someone who's like, the

mayor of Hollywood.

DEALER

(subtly)

Crack? You want some crack? Sweet-

ass rock. Get you high.

JAY

No man, but you want some weed?

DEALER

(beat)

You on the job?

JAY

(pulling out a card)

Yeah, boy. Jersey Local 408.

DEALER

I'm Los Angeles Local 305!

DEALER

You guys got medical in Jersey yet?

JAY

Shit, no, we might have to strike in

September.

DEALER

Norma Rae like a motherfucker. You

gots to get your benefits, you know

what I'm saying?

JAY

I hear that. Yo--maybe you can help

us out. You know where they're

shooting a movie around here.

DEALER

You in this town and you gonna ask

that question? Be a little more

specific.

JAY

It's a Miramax flick. We gotta bust

it up so people stop calling us names

on the Internet, even though they're

not really talking about us but these

characters based on us, and at the

same time, find my ex-girlfriend-who-

got-killed-in-a-car-explosion's

monkey.

DEALER

I don't know that the fuck you just

said, little kid. But you touched a

brother's heart, so I'm gonna help

you out with some directions to the

studio.

JAY

You know where Miramax is at?

DEALER

Fuck, yes. Miramax accounts for

seventy-eight percent of my business.

STEVE KMETKO

Is Hollywood ready for Jay and Silent

Bob?  A source at the Federal Wildlife

Marshal's Office tells us a posting

was pulled off an Internet movie

chat board that was allegedly written

by the two domestic terrorists

themselves. It's sending a shockwave

through Hollywood. Jules Asner's on

the scene at Miramax Studios, Jules?

JULES ASNER

Steve, the tenor of Tinseltown is

one of terror today, after the Federal

Wildlife Marshal's Office learned

that hot, new terrorists Jay and

Silent Bob are targeting Miramax

Studios for their next campaign of

blood, violence and monkey-theft. In

the posting, pulled off Movie Poop

Shoot.com, the gruesome twosome

threatened, quote--

(reading)

"Once we get to Hollywood and find

those Miramax Expletive-Deleted who

are making the Bluntman and Chronic

movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our

Expletive-Deleted, then Expletive-

Deleted, which is made up of our

Expletive-Deleted, then eat their

Expletive-Deleted, which is made up

of our Expletive-Deleted that we

made 'em eat. Unquote. So far, we

haven't been able to get a statement

from anyone here are the studio.

STEVE

Jules, word has it that Ben Affleck

and Matt Damon are on the lot,

shooting a super-secret project.

Have you seen then roaming around?

JULES

No, Steve. But I did see Casey Affleck

buying a soda at a concession stand

earlier.

STEVE

But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob?

JULES

None whatsoever. However, to be fair,

all the feds have to work with is

murky videotape, so no one's even a

hundred percent sure what Jay and

Silent Bob look like, exactly. For

all we know, they could already be

on the lot.

JUSTICE

Oh my God! Jay! No!

JUSTICE

Fuck it.

SISSY

That bitch!  That fucking, fucking

bitch!!!

(to girls)

Get dressed. We're going after her.

CHRISSY

Fuck that, I didn't get to cum yet.

SISSY

Which is more important to you: a

fortune in diamonds or busting a

nut?

SISSY (O.S.)

Chrissy! Now!

CHRISSY

Fuck--

JAY

We gotta play this right.

JAY

I hate how fake Hollywood is.

SECURITY GUARD

Where do you think you're going?

JAY

GET OFFA ME! RAAAAAPE!!!

SECURITY GUARD

This is L.A., sir. We don't rape our

suspects in custody. We just beat

them.

(into walkie-talkie)

Echo Base, I've got a ten-o-seven

here: two unauthorizeds on the lot.

Request back-up.

VOICE

(from walkie-talkie)

I thought that was a ten-eighty-two.

SECURITY GUARD

No, sir--a ten-eight-two is the code

for vanishing a dead hooker from Ben

Affleck's trailer.

VOICE

(from walkie-talkie)

Oh, that Affleck. Backup on the way.

JAY

Hey! I make you a deal: this guy'll

suck your dick off if you let us go!

SECURITY GUARD

Contrary to what you believe, not

everyone in the movie business is

gay.

JAY

Well, how about this deal: he sucks

my dick while you watch and jerk

off.

SECURITY GUARD

Alright. But make is fast. And sexy.

JAY

Dude, it's either this or jail. And

you know what they make you do in

jail.

JAY

Well what are you waiting for, bitch?

Start sucking. Bunnggg!

(looking around)

Alright--where they shooting this

movie at?

JAY

Worth a shot. Like a shot in the

mouth, you gay bitch. Eww, dude--you

were really gonna suck my dick.

A.D.

Alright--bar extras. Follow me.

PHONE VOICE

Federal Bureau of Investigation

WILLENHOLLY

Yes, this is Federal Wildlife Marshal

Willenholly. Can I speak with Agent

Sid Enmarty, please?

PHONE VOICE

One moment, please.

SPEAKER VOICE

Agent Enmarty? A Marshal Willenholly

calling.

AGENT SID

(perking up)

Holy shit! Yeah, put him through.

(calling off)

YO! INCOMING BITCH BOY PHONER!

AGENT SID

Willenholly?

WILLENHOLLY

Sid? Hey, buddy. I'm calling because

I could really use your help on this

killer case I'm working.

AGENT SID

I'll bet, Will. What's it this time...

Beaver trouble? Some kind of

unauthorized marsupial trafficking?

WILLENHOLLY

(taking it in stride)

No, no--nothing like that. Say--there

aren't other people listening in,

are there?

AGENT SID

No way, man. It's just me and you

talking here.

WILLENHOLLY

Good. I'm tracking a monkey down

that's on it's way to Los Angeles,

and I could use some bureau backup.

AGENT SID

Los Angeles, hunh? Maybe we should

stake out Clint Eastwood's place.

Didn't he used to drive around with

a monkey that'd punch people and

drink beer?

WILLENHOLLY

Am, uh--Am I on speaker phone?

AGENT SID

No way--Dunston!

WILLENHOLLY

Alright, now that's not fair. I know

I didn't make it as high up as you

guys, but my job's just as important.

AGENT SID

Calm down, Will. Don't go all...

bananas on us!

WILLENHOLLY

I come to you as a friend--as a fellow

professional--and this is the shit I

get?!

AGENT SID

You're right, Will. Tell you what--

we'll get our best man on your case

right away. You might've heard of

him. He's a doctor.

WILLENHOLLY

(excited)

Oh, a doctor?

AGENT SID

His name's Doctor Zaius!

WILLENHOLLY

SCREW YOU GUYS!

BEN

Where are we taking it from, Gus?

GUS

I'm busy.

BEN

You're a true artist, Gus

MATT

Just take it from "It's a good

course."

BEN

Oh, now you're the director.

MATT

Hey, shove it. Bounce-boy. Let's

remember who talked who into doing

this shit in the first place. Talking

me into Dogma was one thing, but

this--

BEN

I'm sorry this is taking you away

from whatever-gay-killers-on-horses-

who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely-

flick you're supposed to be doing

this week.

MATT

Oh--I'm touchy-feely? I take it you

never saw Forces of Nature?

BEN

You're like a child. What've I been

telling you? Sometimes you've gotta

do the safe picture. Sometimes, you

do it for art. Sometimes, it's the

payback picture your friend says you

owe him--

BEN

And sometimes, you go back to the

well.

MATT

And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games.

BEN

Now that's just mean.

JAY

This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick,

'cause that's those two fucks from

that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do

is figure out a way to get close to

them--

A.D.

Just stand there and react. Don't

say anything.

JAY

(off A.D.'s comment)

That's pretty funny.

A.D.

(calling out)

Alright, people. Lock it up. Let's

go for picture.

JAY

On the count of three, we rush those

fucks and beat the shit out of 'em.

'Cause if they're all fucked up,

they can't make the move, right?

Alright, then.  One--two--

CLAPPER/LOADER (O.S.)

Good Will Hunting Two: Hunting Season.

CLAPPER/LOADER

Scene sixteen, take five.

BEN

Action, Gus?

GUS

Jesus, Ben--I said I'm busy.

BEN/CHUCKIE

You should check it out, it's a good

course. But, you know, frankly, I

found the class rather elementary.

CLARK

You know, I don't doubt that it was.

I remember that class. It was just

between recess and lunch.

BEN/CHUCKIE

Are we gonna have a problem, again?

CLARK

There's no problem. I was still just

hoping you might give me some insight

into the evolution of the market

economy in the Southern Colonies.

See, Wood says--

MATT/WILL

(stepping in)

What'd I say? Didn't I say you'd be

back here regurgitating Gordon Wood.

But you forgot about Vickers--

CLARK

No, I just read Vickers, so I'm up

on inherited wealth, Hunting. But

you're not the angry, brilliant young

mind you once were, just itching to

vent your frustrations.

CLARK

Once Sean told you it wasn't your

fault, you lost the edge, William.

You stopped hitting the books with a

vengeance, and now I've read shit

you haven't even heard about yet.

Face facts, my friend--love made you

a soft little pussy boy, unable to

stand up to an academic showdown,

like you used to. You're just no

longer that good--Will Hunting.

(gets in his face)

Now how do you like them apples?

BEN/CHUCKIE

I don't like the sound of them apples.

Will, what're we gonna do now?

MATT/WILL

Chuckie--

(snarling)

It's Hunting season.

BEN/CHUCKIE

Apple sauce, bitch.

SECURITY GUARD

Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but have a

ten-oh-seven on our hands.

BEN

Wait a second! I wasn't with any

hookers today!

SECURITY GUARD

THERE THEY ARE!

JAY

Affleck, you're the bomb in Phantoms,

yo.

MATT

If anyone's looking for me, I'll be

in my trailer trying to figure out

how I got here from an Academy Award.

CLAPPER/LOADER

Scream four, scene thirty-seven,

take one.

(claps it and rushes

off)

WES CRAVEN

Action!

SHANNEN DOHERTY

Alright, you bastard! Let's see who

you really are!

SHANNEN DOHERTY

Fucking Miramax--

(getting up)

CUT!

WES CRAVEN

Shannen, usually I say "cut."

SHANNEN DOHERTY

A monkey? Jesus, you guys aren't

even trying anymore, are you?

WES CRAVEN

The market research suggest that

people love monkeys.

JAY

WE LOVE THIS MONKEY!

WES CRAVEN

See?

JAY

What the fuck are we gonna do?

JAY

PUNCH IT!!!

JAMES

Holy shit--that looked like it hurt.

JASON

Are you guys alright?

(off Suzanne)

Hey! They've got a monkey!

JAY

Yo, I think that shit just kicked

in.

JAMES

Let's get you guys on your feet.

JAY

(to James)

See man?  Its never, "Hey--you were

in Loser, or, "Dude--you rocked in

Boys and Girls." It always comes

back to that fucking pie! I'm haunted

by it.!

JAMES

Well, you put your dick in a pie,

dude--

JASON

Enough!

(to Jay)

Jason Biggs.

JAY

Yo-you really get to third base with

the Russsian chick like you did in

the movies?

JASON

You mean Shannon? Sadly, no.

JAY

She's fucking hot, man. If I was

you, I'd been like--

JAY

(off James's-look)

What, man? You never did one of these?

JAY

Holy shit? You're the Dawson!

JAMES

It's James, actually. James Van Der

Beek.

JAY

Yo, what's up with Pacey stealing

Joey away from you? If I was you, I

would've drowned his ass in your

Creek and shit!

JAMES

I know, Because what--is Josh better

looking than me? Fuck, no. I mean,

who on earth is better looking that

me? I ask you.

JAY

Joey, man! She's too fine! Yo--did

you ever get to third base with her?

JAMES

Well, there was this one time--

(catching himself)

Wait a second--who are you guys?!

JASON

They're our stunt doubles, dumbass.

(to Jay)

Right?

JAY

Stunt doubles for what?

JAMES

The movie we start shooting in a few

minutes--Bluntman and Chronic Strike

Back.

JASON

(to Bob)

You're doubling me. I'm playing

Bluntman, AKA Silent Bill.

JAMES

Bob

JASON

Right. And he's playing Chronic. AKA

Ray.

JAMES

Jay! Shit, did you even read the

script?

JASON

There's a script?

JAY

These are the guys who are playing

us, yo. We take them out, and bickety-

bam! No movie.

JASON

(off Jay and Bob, to

James)

What's with the weird, gay huddle

going on over there?

JAMES

What's gay about it? It's two guys

talking in a corner. Man--why are

you such a homophobe.

JASON

I'm not a homophobe.

JAMES

You are. You're always calling things

gay. "Ooo--look at the gay huddle,

dude!"

JASON

Hey--look at the monkey.

JAMES

Next you're going to tell me the

monkey's gay.

JASON

He's so cute--

(to Suzanne)

C'mere. Monkey. C'mere--

JAY

Alright, here's what we do: start

swinging, and don't stop until those

young Hollywood fucks are out of

commission. Ready? Break!

JAY

That's one funky monkey.

VOICE (O.S.)

Mister Biggs?  Mister Van... Der--

Beek? This is Security. We've got a

pair of intruders at large, and they

crashed through a window we thought

might be yours.

JAY

(to door; deepening

voice)

Uh--yeah. They're in here.

SECURITY GUARD

Do they have you hostage? Should we

call your publicists?

JAY

NO! I mean, we kicked those guys'

asses bad. They're--knocked out.

SECURITY GUARD

Great work, sirs! If you let us in,

we'll take over--

JAY (O.S.)

(through door)

NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in

here! Together!

SECURITY GUARD

Uh--okay. We'll just be--outside the

door, sirs.

JAY

What the fuck are we gonna do?! How

are we gonna get out of here without

them seeing us?

JAMES

YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS!

JASON

HEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M

THE PIE-FUCKER.

SECURITY GUARD

(to Cops)

He'll be the pie--in prison.

JAY

This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In

these outfits we're totally incognito.

A.D.

Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek?

Great--you've changed costumes

already. Let's get you to set.

(pulling them off)

The director doesn't like to be kept

waiting.

DIRECTOR

Look at all these crackers, Seventy

million dollars and I can't even get

a black grip?

P.A.

Here's your coffee, sir.

DIRECTOR

(eyes the coffee)

You spit in this?  Because I know

all you white folks are pissed off

that the studio'd entrust a multi-

million dollar to a brother.

P.A.

I didn't spit in it, sir.

DIRECTOR

Then taste it! Go on!

P.A.

It's all good, sir.

DIRECTOR

No it ain't all good. Oh, you think

I want it now, after your lips touched

the cup? Get the fuck off my set!

P.A.

You the man, sir.

DIRECTOR

No you the Man! And that's the

problem!

BANKY

Uh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky

Edwards, the creator of Bluntman and

Chronic. We met a few weeks back.

I'm the executive producer.

DIRECTOR/CHAKA

Oh--you're the executive producer,

hunh? Well go "produce" me a latte

no white folks spit in--okay Fucky?

BANKY

Banky. I just wanted you to know

that I respect your work as an artist.

I'm something of an artist myself. I

was the inker on the comic book.

CHAKA

An inker? What, like you trace?

A.D.

Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the

set, Chaka.

CHAKA

I don't see 'em. Where are they?

(into bullhorn)

WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE STARS OF THIS

PIECE OF SHIT?!

JAY

This must've set 'em back a couple

hundred bucks.

CHAKA

Look at this shit.

(off their outfits)

A gay hood ornament, and the color

Purple.

JAY

Who the fuck are you?

CHAKA

Who the fuck am I? I'm the fucking

director, is who I am. Chaka Luther

King. The creator of all of this.

JAY

Wait a sec--I thought Holden and

Banky created this shit.

CHAKA

And I'm stealing it. I'm taking it

back for all the shit you people

have stolen from us! Did you know, I

came up with the idea for Sesame

Street before PBS? I was going to

call it N.W.P.--Niggaz with Puppets.

(beat)

Alright--enough small talk. Let's

shoot it.

JAY

Wait, wait, wait!! Aren't you gonna

direct us?

CHAKA

I'll be directing you to the food

stamps line after I fire your ass,

if you talk back like that to me

again!

JAY

But we don't know what we're supposed

to do here. We didn't even read the

script.

CHAKA

So? Neither did I. Shit, neither did

the studio.

(pointing O.C.)

Look man, it's not hard. In this

scene, the bad guy breaks into the

Bluntcave.  You make up some shit,

fight him for a while, I film it, I

yell "cut," and then head back to my

trailer, where I got more white women

waiting for me there than the first

lifeboat off the Titanic!

(confidentially)

They all want a part of the movie,

and I got just the part for 'em.

CHAKA

LET'S ROLL WITH THE NEW!

A.D. (O.S.)

QUIET ON THE SET! THIS IS A TAKE!

P.A.

I got you another cup of coffee,

sir. Spit free.

CLAPPER/LOADER

I just wanna say that I loved when

you fucked that pie.

(calling off)

BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC STRIKE BACK,

SCENE THIRTY-SEVEN, TAKE ONE!

CHAKA

ACTION!

JAY/CHRONIC

Uh--Snootchie Bootchies.

JAY/CHRONIC

What the fuck?

COCK-KNOCKER

You thought I'd never find your

precious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp

Knight? But now you and your sidekick

are finally in the grasp of Cock-

Knocker!

JAY/CHRONIC

Why do they call you "Cock-Knocker"?

COCK-KNOCKER

Any last words before I bust your

balls, Bluntman?

CHAKA

(from behind monitor)

Damn! Now that was one special effect!

This picture's gonna make House Party

look like House Party Two!

A.D.

Or House Party Three?

CHAKA

Shut the fuck up!

JAY (O.S.)

YO-BITCH-FISTS!

JAY

Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg.

CHAKA

(from behind the

monitor)

I think George Lucas is going to sue

somebody--

WILLENHOLLY

(looking around)

So, this is Hollywood?

(suddenly full of

purpose)

Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent

Bob.

WILLENHOLLY

FREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!!

WILLENHOLLY

Oh my God--

(to kids)

Um--sorry. That was supposed to be a

warning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm

on the wrong, uh--wrong set.

KID

You killed Mooby--

(to Kids)

LET'S GET HIM!!!

COCK-KNOCKER

(breaking character)

You are not upstaging me, Van Der

Beek!

COCK-KNOCKER

(to O.C. Chaka)

CHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A

"CUT"!

JAY

Now whose balls have been busted,

bitch?

WILLENHOLLY

The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and

Silent Bob!

(revealing badge:

calling out)

Everyone stay calm. I'm a Federal

Wildlife Marshal. These men are the

leaders of a terrorist organization

wanted for the abduction of a monkey.

VOICE (O.S.)

They didn't really steal that monkey.

JUSTICE

It was just a diversion so we could

steal these.

JUSTICE

And they're not the leaders of

C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real.

WILLENHOLLY

No--the clit's real. The female orgasm

is a myth.

JUSTICE

(to Jay)

Are you guys alright?

JAY

I thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty

Fuck.

JUSTICE

(smiling)

You remembered.

(back to business)

It was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy,

Chrissy, and I are international

jewel thieves. We were setting you

up as a patsy, but I couldn't go

through with it, because I... because

I love you.

JAY

Yeah? So that means you'll fuck me,

right?

VOICE (O.S.)

If she does, it'll be considered

necrophilia.

SISSY

Because she's gonna be one dead bitch.

(to Justice)

Hi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad

time?

MISSY

You should've just let these guys go

down, Jussy.

JAY

Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was

waiting until I got to know her a

little better. See, there was this

little angel on my shoulder, and he

said--

CHRISSY

Shut the fuck up before I shoot you

where you stand in your pansy red

booties.

JAY

(looking down)

Holy shit, I am wearing pansy red

booties!

(to Bob)

Man--why the fuck didn't you tell

me?

SISSY

Let's have those diamonds, Jussy.

JUSTICE

I can't do that, Sissy

SISSY

(points her gun at

Jay)

Then lover--boy gets one in the brain.

CHAKA

YO!

CHAKA

Would any of you lovely ladies like

a private audition to be in my movie?

WILLENHOLLY

WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M

JUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!!

CHRISSY

TWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING,

TALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES!

MISSY

AND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN.

WILLENHOLLY

ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE!

CHAKA

A shitload of white people with guns?

Time to get my black ass out of here!

SISSY

You really let me down, Justice.

Throwing it all away for a little

stoner with bad pronunciation.

JAY (O.S.)

HEY!

JUSTICE

(ignoring him)

What's it gonna be, Sissy? Which

fighting style do you want me to

kick your ass in?

SISSY

Are you kidding me? I taught you all

all your moves myself. There's not a

style you can bust that I can't defend

against.

JUSTICE

You're no match for my "Shaolin Monk."

SISSY

Yeah, but I can bury you with my

"Crouching Tiger."

JUSTICE

A little "Venus's--flytrap"?

SISSY

I'll counter with "Dragon Crane."

JUSTICE

How about a little "Bitch, My Man

Ain't Yo Baby's Daddy"?

SISSY

(beat; smiles)

Bring it on.

JAY

Yo--I hope one of 'em rips the other

one's shirt off and we see some tit.

BANKY

Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I

just wanted to say hi. I'm--

JAY

Banky fucking Edwards! Just the

motherfucker we came to see!

BANKY

(shocked)

Holy shit! What the fuck are you

guys doing here?!

BANKY

Stop the movie?! Are you crazy?!

JAY

All these assholes are calling us

names on the Internet, 'cause of

this stupid movie!

BANKY

I feel for you boys--I really do.

Those Net snipers can be really cruel.

But Miramax paid me a shitload of

money for Bluntman and Chronic, so

it occurs to me that people bad-

mouthing you on some web-site is

none of my FUCKING CONCERN!

SILENT BOB

Oh--but I think it is.

JAY

Here we go again--

SILENT BOB

Shut the fuck up.

(to Banky)

We had a deal with you on the comics

for likeness rights. And as we're

not only the artistic basis but also

the character basis for your

intellectual property, Bluntman and

Chronic, when we said property was

optioned by Miramax Films you were

legally obliged to secure our

permission to transfer the concept

to another medium. As you failed to

do that, you're in breach of the

original contract--ergo, you find

yourself in a very actionable

position.

JAY

Yeah.

BANKY

So, what do you guys want, to go

away and take your lady friends with

you?

JAY

Shitcan this movie so we don't get

called names on the Internet anymore.

BANKY

Even if there's no movie, people are

still free to talk shit about you on

the Internet. That's what the

Internet's for: slandering others

anonymously.  Stopping the flick

isn't going to stop that!

JAY

Well this isn't fair!  We went to

Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole

a monkey, we got shot at, and got

punched in the motherfucking nuts!

We ain't leaving empty-handed!

JAY

What's up baby? You look good!

BANKY

Isn't that your girlfriend's enemy?

JAY

Oh yeah.

(pushing Sissy off

him)

Get the fuck offa me, pig!

BANKY

You guys are gonna ruin my movie

career.

JAY

Well, we want something for our mental

anguish.

BANKY

Tell you what: we'll settle this

monetarily. I'll give you half of

what I made.

JAY

Half?!?

BANKY

Half's not good enough?  Fine--I'll

give you two-thirds of what I made!

JAY

Fuck-you--you already said half? You

can't take it back!

BANKY

Done

SISSY

Your shit is so tired, Justice!

JUSTICE

Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!

WILLENHOLLY

Hello? Truce?

(beat)

I think I killed both of them.

JUSTICE

C'mon guys. It's over.

JAY

Yo, I was just about to jump in there

and get your back.

JAY

Holy shit, the cops! We gotta get

out of here!

JUSTICE

No. I'm tired of running.

JUSTICE

You awake, Marshal? Marshal?

WILLENHOLLY

(tries to move but

can't)

Oh my God, I'm paralyzed. The monkey

shot me in the ass and paralyzed me!

Oh the irony!

JUSTICE

(off Suzanne's gun)

You're not paralyzed. It was just a

tranquilizer.

WILLENHOLLY

Jesus! Tranqued by a little monkey!

My friends in the Bureau are never

gonna let me live this down!

JUSTICE

You have friends in the F.B.I.?

WILLENHOLLY

(crying)

They all made it in, but I failed

the exam. Why the hell else do you

think I became a Federal Wildlife

Marshal? 'Cause I'm a joke!

JUSTICE

Maybe not. I can make you a deal

that'll get you into the F.B.I.,

regardless of test scores.

WILLENHOLLY

What kind of deal?

JUSTICE

You drop the charges against Jay and

Silent Bob and say you never found

the ape.  Make sure the world knows

they're not in control of any C.L.I.T.

JAY

Now wait a second--

JUSTICE

I'll explain later, Jay

(to Willenholly)

In exchange, I'll give you the

diamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy,

Missy, Chrissy, and myself. But I

want a reduced sentence.

WILLENHOLLY

You'd be willing to do that?

JUSTICE

(off Jay)

For him? I'd be willing to do

anything.

JUSTICE

I'm an international jewel thief

who's facing a jail sentence.

JAY

That's alright. I'm a junkie with a

monkey.

JUSTICE

If I go to prison, will you wait for

me?

JAY

I don't know. Will we fuck when you

get out?

JAY

Don't change the subject. Will we

fuck when you get out?

JUSTICE

Snoogans.

WILLENHOLLY

Wow. There's a lot of love in the

room.

BANKY

Regardless of what you may have heard.

I do not kiss guys.

WILLENHOLLY

Sorry, Justice. We've gotta go.

(to Jay: friendly)

Hey--stop stealing monkeys.

JAY

Fuck you.

WILLENHOLLY

Fair enough.

JUSTICE

(to Jay)

Wait for me.

JAY

What--here?

BANKY

Well, boys--you're rich in love--

(indicating Jay)

Well, you're in love. And to top

that off, you've got your own monkey.

What more could two guys from Jersey

possibly want?

JAY

All those fucks to stop talking shit

about us on the Internet, for

starters.

BANKY

What do I keep telling you? There's

not much you can do to stop that.

Well, short of showing up at all

their houses and beating the shit

out of them, I guess.

JAY

(to Bob)

You know--with all that money we're

gonna make we can buy a lotta plane

tickets.

MOTHER

Can I help you?

JAY

Yes. Ma'am, Does--

(reading of paper)

William Dusky live here?

MOTHER

Yes. He's my son.

JAY

May we talk to him, please.

MOTHER

One moment.

KID

Yeah?

JAY

Yo--do you post as--

(reading off paper)

Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com?

KID

Yeah.

JAY

And did you write "Fuck Jay and Silent

Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses?

KID

Yeah, a while ago. So?

JAY

On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say

Jay and Silent Bob--

(reading off paper)

"--are fucking clown shoes. If they

were real, I'd beat the shit out of

them for being so stupid."

KID

(chuckling)

Yeah.

JAY

Really--

RANDAL

Now that was worse then Clash of the

Titans.

DANTE

I still can't believe Judy Dench

played me.

RANDAL

Hey--remind me to renew that

restraining order.

DANTE

Why?

RANDAL

Because I'm gonna blast the flick on

the Internet tonight.

STEVE-DAVE

Why can't Hollywood ever make a decent

comic book movie?

WALT

Tell'em Steve-Dave!

STEVE-DAVE

Would you stop saying that?

TRISH

Well, that was just another paean to

male adolescence and its refusal to

grow up.

ALYSSA

Yeah, sis--but it was better than

Mallrats. At least Holden had the

good sense to keep his name off of

it.

TRISH

Why wouldn't Miramax option his other

comic instead? You know--the one he

drew about you and him and your

relationship?

ALYSSA

You mean Chasing Amy? That would

never work as a movie.

BANKY

I'm so fucking embarrassed--

HOOPER

Honey, you should be. They took your

characters and reduced them to one

ninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was

like watching Batman and Robin again.

BANKY

Thanks. That means a lot coming from

the guy who pretends to be Shaft as

opposed to the guy who takes shaft.

HOOPER

I don't hear you complaining nightly.

In fact, the only thing I do hear

you say is "Yes, Hooper! Cradle the

balls and work the shaft!"

BANKY

(looking around)

Hey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in

public!

GUY

Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!

BANKY

(recognizing him)

You--!

GUY

That's right, you sonovabitch! I'm

back for round two!

WILLENHOLLY

You know, I don't get out to the

movies much. But I'd have to say

Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!

JUSTICE

Are these leg cuffs really necessary?

WILLENHOLLY

Don't make me shoot you, Justice.

JAY

YO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET,

FEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE

WORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!
