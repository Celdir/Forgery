MOM

Who wants fruit salad?

MISTY

I do, please.

MOM

(Hesitating)

That's not gum in your mouth,

is it?

MISTY

(Removing it)

It's sugarless.

MOM

(Gently)

You know how I hate gum,

Misty.  All that chomping

and cheesing...

(Begins serving her)

MISTY

Sorry, Mom.  Thanks.

(To her brother, as she

prices a record album)

Hey, Chip, think I could get

50c for Vanilla Ice.

CHIP

I wouldn't give ya a nickle.

MISTY

(Dreamily)

Carl can't believe how much I

make at swap meets.

MOM

(Rolling her eyes good-naturedly)

And

who

may I ask is Carl?

MISTY

Just a boy.  He's picking me up

this morning.

CHIP

Here we go again.

MISTY

He's

really

cute!

MOM

(Watching the cute little

birds nibbling seed from

the bird-feeder in kitchen

window)

Cute is not enough, Misty.

You know that.

CHIP

She sure can pick 'em!

MISTY

(Exasperated)

He goes to

college

with me!

DAD

Leave her alone, Chip.

(To MOM)

I think it's great she has a

new beau, Beverly.

MOM

Cereal anybody?

DAD

Just a little, please.  Bad

for the teeth.

CHIP

Always the dentist.

MOM

Chip, honey?

CHIP

Thanks, Mom.

DAD

(Reading paper)

Look at this!

(Reading out loud in disgust)

"Hillside Strangler gets his

college degree in prison!"

MOM

(Preoccupied, stalking fly)

That's nice.

DAD

Nice?!  He should have been

executed!

MISTY

He

killed

people, Mom.

MOM

(To herself)

We all have bad nights.

(Gets ready to swat, but fly

buzzes off)

CHIP

(To MISTY)

You'd

probably date him!

(Mimicking her)

He's cu-uuute!  Hey, Dad, did

you ever see "Henry, Portrait of

a Serial Killer?"

DAD

I certainly did not.

MISTY

You've been working in that

video shop too long.

DAD

And all that gore better hadn't be

interfering with your schoolwork.

CHIP

I do great in school, Dad.

(Eats toast as fly buzzes off)

DAD

Well, your mother's going to PTA

today.  We'll see what your

teacher has to say.

(Takes a big gulp as fly buzzes away)

CHIP

(Giving a pleading look to MOM as

the buzzing of the fly builds in

intensity on the soundtrack)

Aw, Mom!  I hate Mr. Stubbins!

MOM

(Moving in for the kill, hissing

the words in a rage)

Don't say the word "hate", honey.

"Hate" is a very serious word!

MOM

There.  All better.

(Suddenly all innocence)

Anybody for scrambled eggs?

DAD

(Getting up from table)

Who on earth...?

DET. MOORE

Mrs. Sutphin?

MOM

(Nervously)

Yes?

DET. MOORE

(Shows badge)

I'm Detective Moore and this

is Detective Bradford.

DAD

(Taking over)

I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin.  What's

the trouble, officer?

CHIP

(Excitedly)

Is there a killer loose?

DET. MOORE

No son, nothing that exciting.

MOM

This is my son, Chip...and my

daughter, Misty.

MISTY

(Inappropriately making eyes

at the younger cop)

Hi!

CHIP

(Seeing MISTY flirting)

Jeeezzz!

MOM

Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but

we don't allow gum chewing

in this house.

(Hands him a paper napkin)

DET. BRADFORD

(Spitting his gum into

paper napkin)

Sorry, ma'am.

(To MOM and DAD, taking out

an envelope)

We're investigating obscene

phone calls and mail threats to

a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.

MOM

I know Dottie!

DAD

She lives right down the street.

DET. BRADFORD

Could you take a look at this...

DET. MOORE

...And tell us of anybody who

might be responsible?

DET. BRADFORD

(As he hands note to MOM and DAD)

I should warn you...this note

contains LANGUAGE.

MOM

(Recoiling)

Oh God, really!

(Hands it back to cop)

This is the limit!

CHIP

Let me see!

DAD

Sorry, son.

(In disgust)

This is a matter for adults.

MOM

Officers, I've never said the

P-word out loud, much

less

written it down!

DAD

No

woman

would!

MOM

(Seeing cute little bird

land on window feeder)

Look officers!  Life doesn't

have

to be ugly.

(In baby-talk)

See the little birdie?  Listen

to his call.

(Imitating bird call)

Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

BIRD

Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!

BIRDIE

(Leaping out of convertible)

Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Sutphin.

DAD

(To cops, getting into his car)

That's Birdie.  She's a horror nut

just like my son.

MOM

(Fondly)

Good morning, Birdie.  This is

Detectives Moore and Bradford.

BIRDIE

(Overdramatic, feigning horror)

I didn't do it!  I swear!  Don't

lock me up!  I'll take a lie detector!

(Kisses CHIP)

(Good-naturedly to COPS)

Hi ya, boys!

MOM

(Sarcastically to a sullen

SCOTTY in car)

Good morning Scotty!

BIRDIE

Hey Misty, look what I got!

(Pulling it out of bag)

A Pee Wee Herman Doll.  Can you

sell it for me at the flea market?

MISTY

(Impressed)

Wow!  Still in the box!  I sure can!

(Looks up and sees a Trans Am

speeding towards the house)

Oh God, here comes Carl!

CARL

(To MOM)

You must be Mrs. Sutphin.

I'm Carl Padgett.

MOM

Misty's date...

CARL

More of a friend really...

MISTY

(To CARL)

See what Birdie gave me to

sell at the flea market?

CARL

(Sneering at Pee-Wee)

That guy's a weirdo.

MOM

(Pointing to SCOTTY and

calling out to COPS as they

get into their car)

Now

there's

something you should

be interested in, detectives.  A

grown boy who doesn't wear his

seat belts!

Goddamn you!  STOP CALLING HERE!

MOM

Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?

DOTTIE

(Furious)

You bitch!

MOM

Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?

Who is this?

MOM

Mrs. Wilson from the telephone

company.  I understand you're

(Taking the sewing basket)

Thanks for remembering.

MRS. ACKERMAN

It's the least I could do.

(Suspicious)

I heard shouting.

MOM

(Slamming it shut)

Just the damn cable TV company.

You know how they are.

Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?

But, Mr. Stubbins, my son

studies every night!  He's

trying as hard as he can...

MR. STUBBINS

to come to PTA.

Mrs. Sutphin, where's that

husband of yours?

and pointing to his teeth)

Feeling "down in the mouth"?!

(Peeking inside)

Oooohh!  A fruit cake.  Thank

you, Mrs. Sutphin.  Have a seat.

MOM

Bon Appetit!

MR. STUBBINS

Chip is off to a fine start

this year.

(Checking his roll book)

Focused...conscientious...

participates actively in

classroom discussion.

MOM

(Proudly)

He's a good boy.

MR. STUBBINS

(Suddenly serious)

There

is

one big problem though.

MOM

What is it, Mr. Stubbins?

MR. STUBBINS

(Spitting out the words)

His unhealthy obsession with

sick horror films.

MOM

(Relieved)

He

is

assistant manager of a

video shop...

MR. STUBBINS

(Cutting her off)

That's no excuse for a morbid

imagination.  I caught him

drawing this in class last week.

(Unfolds lurid drawing of woman

getting her tongue pulled out

with the title, "Blood Feast")

Is there a problem at home?

MOM

(Shocked)

Certainly not!

MR. STUBBINS

Divorce?  An alcoholic relative?

(Knowingly)

Tell me, did Chip torture animals

when he was young?

MOM

(Furious)

No, he did not! We are a loving

supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.

MR. STUBBINS

Well, you're doing something

wrong, Mrs. Sutphin.  I'd

recommend therapy for your son.

(Rising from his chair)

Thank you for taking the time

to come to PTA.

Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.

CHIP

Hi, Mom.

BIRDIE

Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.

MOM

(Giggles)

You kids.  Now Birdie, I want

you to have a cookie and then

run along home.

CHIP

But Mom, the video's not over.

MOM

No "but mom" for you, young man.

Mr. Stubbins seems to think these

silly movies are interfering with

your studies.

(Turns off video with remote)

BIRDIE

(Rolling her eyes)

Oh, boy!

(Getting ready to leave)

CHIP

Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!

SCOTTY

Man, that one made me puke!

being a teenager but I understand..

I'm your mother and I love you.

Nothing like a home cooked

meal, honey.

MOM

Misty, I made your favorite

sesame broccoli...

(Passes it to her)

MISTY

Yummy.  Carl says if I lose

ten pounds, he'll take me to

the University of Maryland

Fall Mixer.

MOM

(Appalled)

Misty, if you want to lose

weight go ahead, but do it for

yourself

, not for some boy you

barely know.

CHIP

Carl's a jerk!

DAD

He certainly

drives

like a jerk.

MISTY

(Getting upset)

Carl makes me happy and that

threatens

this family, doesn't it?

DAD

Doesn't threaten me, honey.

I'm happy.

MOM

I'm happy too and we want you

to be happy.

BIRDIE

This is

so

cool! It's just like

a horror movie.

CHIP

It's on!  I'll call you back!

(Hangs up)

ANNOUNCER

..Police claim the driver of

the hit and run vehicle ran

down the teacher in cold blood

and then backed up over his

body to finish off the job.

Mr. Paul Stubbins was

thirty-eight years old...

Whoever did it should get the

death penalty!

ANNOUNCER

...So far only one eyewitness

has surfaced.

LUANN

It was a blue car...I know that

much!

CHIP

That's Lu-Ann Hodges!

MISTY

She's a pothead!

LUANN

...A blue station wagon...

MRS. ACKERMAN

That's like your car, Beverly,

MOM

(Glaring at MRS. ACKERMAN)

I'm not that bad a driver.

(Disapprovingly at TV screen)

Look at her

hair

!

(To CHIP)

Turn it off, honey.

CHIP

(He does)

(In shock)

was

an asshole...

but he didn't deserve to die!

(Putting down his book

as MOM climbs in)

Goodnight, honey.  Don't read

late, we've got a big day with

the birds tomorrow.

MOM

(Picking up and leafing through

"The Encyclopedia of Birds")

I've identified every little

birdie we're going to watch

tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.

DAD

Goodnight, honey.

MOM

Don't I get a kiss?

DAD

(Moving closer)

I just thought with all the

sadness...you wouldn't want...

MOM

(Snuggling up)

We have to concentrate on

life, Eugene.

DAD

(Kissing her)

It's fine with me, Beverly.

(Kisses her again more

passionately)

You want to, honey?  You

think the kids are asleep?

MOM

We can be real quiet...

DAD

(Getting on top of her)

I love that you're my wife.

MOM

(Getting turned on)

You're not bad yourself,

coo-coo bird...

DAD

(Gently making love to her)

You bring me such peace...

DAD

(Groggy)

Well, honey, chickadees breed

in Alaska, you know.  No wonder

Dede's hungry.  It's a long

trip all the way to Baltimore.

DAD

Hello...

MR. STERNER

Eugene, it's Ralph Sterner.

Got a dental emergency here!

(Moans in pain)

I mean this goddamn tooth is

killing me!

Well, Mr. Sterner, if you

call my office, I'm sure we

can see you Monday.

Eugene, this is Betty Sterner,

He'll die by Monday!  The

roots are infected!  He might

have a heart attack!

(Wearily)

All right, Mrs. Sterner...

Nine o'clock.

DAD

(Hangs up)

I'm sorry, honey.  But the birds

sweetly)

Time to get up, that's all.

You'll be late for work.

CHIP

You scared me.

39.    INTERIOR SUTPHIN KITCHEN.

MISTY

It's him!

MOM

No, honey, it's the police.

(Opens back door)

Hello, officers.

DET. BRADFORD

Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

MISTY

(Subtly unbuttoning her

blouse one button)

Hi, Detective Moore.

DET. MOORE

(Embarrassed)

Morning, Misty.

(All business)

Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you heard

of the death of Mr. Stubbins.

MOM

A fine man.  A good teacher...

DET. BRADFORD

(Reading from notes)

Contrusions...fractures...

rupture of numerous vital

organs...

MOM

(In sympathy)

What a mess.

MOM

(Seeing MISTY's eyes light

up at hearing a car)

No, honey, it's just Scotty.

(To COPS)

Scotty, who doesn't wear his

seatbelts!

DAD and CHIP enter kitchen as BIRDIE and SCOTTY

barge in back door.

DAD

Good morning, Detectives.

BIRDIE

(Dramatically)

Nightmare on Calverton Court!

SCOTTY

The Maryland Teacher Massacre!

DET. MOORE

That's not funny, son.

DET. BRADFORD

Did you drive your car to the

PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs.

Sutphin?

MOM

(Buttering toast)

Yes, I did.

DAD

(To cops, getting angry)

Detectives, what is this about?

DET. MOORE

I know this sounds weird,

Mr. Sutphin, but the Department

of Motor Vehicle's computer shows

only one blue station wagon

registered to a parent of any

of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.

DAD

Surely you don't think Beverly

was involved!

SCOTTY

(Hamming it up,

pointing to MOM)

SHE DID IT!  Aimed the car right

at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him

down!

MOM

(Quickly staring daggers at

SCOTTY before patiently

addressing COPS)

From what I understand, the

eye-witness is a drug user.

MISTY

I got somebody you could

run over, Mother!

DAD

Misty, that's a terrible

thing to say!

(Putting his arm

protectively around MOM)

Detectives, it's time for you

to leave.  My wife knows

nothing about this terrible

...accident.

MOM

(Correcting him)

Murder, honey.

SCOTTY

(Picking up a "People"

magazine with Ivana Trump

on the cover)

Now, here's a babe!

DET. MOORE

(Suspiciously)

Let's see that, young man.

MISTY

(Whispering to BIRDIE as

she ogles him from behind)

Nice buns!

DET. BRADFORD

"P" as in...

MOM

(Glaring at SCOTTY)

...People who don't mind their

own business.

MOM

(To DAD)

It's Mrs. Ackerman's magazine,

honey.

Morning, Mrs. Sutphin.

Morning, Gus.  Hello, Sloppy.

miniatures)

Here you go.  You work hard

for the environment.  A little

drink never hurt anybody.

SLOPPY

Thanks, ma'am.

(Takes a big swig)

Damn!  Good stuff.

(Looking at MRS. ACKERMAN's

garbage)

Do you believe that goddamn

litterbugger?

MOM

(Fingering a tin can)

I've told her!  It takes ninety

to one hundred years for a tin

can to decompose but she still

won't recycle.

GUS

(Also taking a guzzle)

Cost taxpayers millions of

dollars last year but she don't

care about the national budget!

MOM

(Deadly serious)

I HATE Mrs. Ackerman.

GUS

(Drinking, encouraging her)

I hate her too.

SLOPPY

(Getting tipsy, joining

the bull session)

I HATE HER GUTS!

(Egging MOM on, laughing)

Somebody ought to kill her!

JUDGE

Quiet in the courtroom! Court

is now in session!

MOM

(To JURY)

Hello, jury people.

My name's Beverly Sutphin.

(To startled woman juror)

I like your jacket!

JUDGE

(Losing patience)

Mrs. Sutphin, I SAID QUIET!

You are accused of mass murder!

This is a court of law, not

a coffee klatch!

(Bangs gavel)

Mr. Nazlerod, your opening

statement.

MR. NAZLEROD

Thank you, your honor.

(Approaches JURY)

Ladies and Gentlemen of the

Jury, my name is Timothy

Nazlerod...

(Smarmily)

...and I hope we can be

friends!

(JURY stares back

impartially)

...I warn you, this is not a

pretty case...Beverly Sutphin

is a woman evil to the core...

(JURY POV shot of innocent-

looking MOM staring back

at them)

...a rotten apple, if you will...

(DAD gulps in sorrow)

...who beyond a reasonable

doubt killed five innocent

people!!

CHIP

(Whispering to BIRDIE,

making excuses)

Well...they

sort

of deserved it...

DAD

(To CHIP)

Shhhhh!

MR. NAZLEROD

...THAT'S RIGHT!  SHE MURDERED

THEM!...WITH A SPEEDING CAR...

A FIRE POKER...

MR. NAZLEROD

...A PAIR OF SCISSORS...

MR. NAZLEROD

...A TOPPLED AIR CONDITIONER!

MR. NAZLEROD

...THE LETHAL FLAMES FROM AN

MR. NAZLEROD

...SHE IS A MONSTER!!

HERBIE HEBDEN

...Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm

Herbie Hebden and you and I

have a tough job ahead of us...

HERBIE HEBDEN

...I have known the Sutphin

family for sixteen years...

HERBIE HEBDEN

...Dad, Eugene, is my dentist...

HERBIE HEBDEN

...Chip and Misty played with

my own children...

HERBIE HEBDEN

...but I've found out I don't

know Beverly Sutphin at all!

HERBIE HEBDEN

...

No

one really knows Beverly

Sutphin...

AFTER

LABOR DAY!!"

HERBIE HEBDEN

...You see...

(He reads note to humor MOM)

...Beverly Sutphin is INSANE!!

MOM

(Suddenly defiant)

I AM NOT!

HERBIE HEBDEN

(Trying to make his point)

Yes, she committed these

terrible crimes...

(Pleading)

...but that doesn't make her

a bad person.

MOM

(Standing)

Your honor, I have a motion.

I would like to fire my

attorney, and defend myself!

HERBIE HEBDEN

Beverly Sutphin is not guilty,

by reason of INSANITY!

MOM

Oh shut up, Herbie!

(To JUDGE)

I have the

right

to defend myself,

your honor.  I've read the

lawbooks!  "Ware vs. State, 1964",

and "Schutte vs. State, 1962".

JUDGE

Mrs. Sutphin, a defendant

who has herself for a lawyer

has a fool for a client...

(To attorneys)

Approach the bench!

JUDGE

(As bench conference

breaks up)

Mrs. Sutphin, I have no

legal choice but to allow

you to take over as your own

attorney.

HERBIE HEBDEN

(Sulking out of courtroom,

to MOM)

You'll get my bill, I mean

it!  A big one!

JUDGE

(To MOM)

How do you plead?

MOM

(Proudly)

NOT GUILTY, your honor!

MR. NAZLEROD

(Furious)

I call to the stand, Dottie

Hinkle!

MR. NAZLEROD

Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever

receive obscene telephone

calls?

DOTTIE

(Staring right at MOM)

I certainly did.

MR. NAZLEROD

Did you recognize the voice

of the caller?

DOTTIE

Not at first, but then I

heard the same inflection in

a voice at a social gathering

and I put two and two together.

MR. NAZLEROD

Who's voice was it, Dottie?

DOTTIE

(Pointing to MOM)

It was

her

!  Beverly Sutphin!

Sittin' right there!

(Dramatically to JURY)

I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!

MOM

Mrs. Hinkle...do you drink?

DOTTIE

(Haughtily)

No, I don't.

MOM

So you weren't drunk when

you received those alleged

obscene phonecalls?

DOTTIE

I certainly was not!

MOM

You mean to tell me the

day I came over to Mrs.

Ackerman's...the day you

claim you recognized my

voice...you weren't drinking?

DOTTIE

(Flustered)

One beer with lunch is

hardly "drinking".

MOM

So you

do

drink?

DOTTIE

Socially...I'll have a

beer.

MOM

So you admit you just

lied?

MR. NAZLEROD

Objection!  Argumentative!

DOTTIE

(Rising to the bait)

NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!

JUDGE

Sustained.

(To DOTTIE)

Watch your mouth, Mrs.

Hinkle.

DOTTIE

(Shocked, to JUDGE)

Did you see her?!  She just

said "Fuck you" to me!

MOM

(Innocently, to JUDGE)

Let the record show I'm

just standing here.

DOTTIE

FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!

JUDGE

I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle.

One more obscenity and I'll

charge you with contempt of

court.

MOM

(Dramatically)

Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?

DOTTIE

NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!

JUDGE

(Bangs gavel)

Mrs. Hinkle, I find you

guilty of contempt of

court and sentence you to

a thousand dollar fine and

five days in jail!

(To MATRONS)

Lock 'er up!

DOTTIE

(To MOM, being dragged

out)

YOU COCK-SUCKER!  YOU LOUSY

YOUNG MAN

CHIP

I'm sorry he's dead, but...

YOUNG MAN

You mean for TV or print?

PLEASE, Miss Hodges!

LU-ANN

DET. BRADFORD

(Looking at MOM hatefully)

In Beverly Sutphin's trash can.

MR. NAZLEROD

(Smugly to MOM)

You may cross-examine, Mrs.

Sutphin.

MOM

(To NAZLEROD)

Thank you.

(To DET. BRADFORD)

Detective Bradford, if I was

to look through your trash can,

what reading material would I

find?

MR. NAZLEROD

Objection!  Immaterial!

JUDGE

You may answer.

DET. BRADFORD

.."Time"..."Newsweek".  My

wife gets "Ladies Home Journal"...

MOM

(Smiling)

Well, this magazine was found in

your trash just last night...

(Holds up porno magazine)

...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".

DET. BRADFORD

GODDAMN YOU!  THAT'S TRESPASSING!

MOM

Don't judge people by what

they read, Detective.

Your witness, Mr. Nazierod.

DET BRADFORD

(Sputtering, purple with rage)

I'm a married man!!

DET. BRADFORD

(Yelling to MOM)

I hope you get the gas chamber!

JUDGE

The jury is instructed to ignore

the outburst of the witness.

MR. NAZLEROD

(Furious at MOM's

cross-examination)

I call to the stand Rosemary

Ackerman!

MR. NAZLEROD

...and did you ever see the

fire poker again after you

left it with Mrs. Sutphin?

MRS. ACKERMAN

Yes!  Thirty minutes later

it was covered with blood and

gore and Carl Padgett was dead!

MR. NAZLEROD

No further questions.

MOM

(Standing to cross-examine)

Mrs. Ackerman, when you left

me at the flea-market, where

did you go?

MRS. ACKERMAN

...Browsing.

MOM

Did Carl Padgett buy

something you wanted?

MRS. ACKERMAN

I didn't want that Faberge

egg - it was chipped!

MOM

Carl Padgett

died

for the

Franklin Mint, didn't he?!

MRS. ACKERMAN

(Shocked at the suspicion

being pointed at her)

NO!  I could never hurt anyone!

MOM

(Not letting up)

That was

your

People magazine

with the letters cut out, wasn't it?

MRS. ACKERMAN

Yes, but I lent it...

MOM

(Cutting her off)

And those were

your

scissors

found sticking out of Mrs.

Sterner's stomach, weren't they?

MRS. ACKERMAN

(Stuttering, panicked)

Yes...but...I didn't...

MOM

(Suddenly, dramatically)

Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?

silence in court as everyone

stares at her in hostility)

No...

MR. NAZLEROD

Would this be what you saw?

DET. MOORE

Yes, sir.  A real barbecue.

MR. NAZLEROD

sure?!

MARVIN

There was nobody next to me:

MR. NAZLEROD

(Losing it)

Mr. Pickles, you testified

before the Grand Jury that

you looked down and "saw a

pair of lady's shoes" in the

stall next to you.

MARVIN

(Lost in his own

perverted glory)

Ohhhh!  I just said what you

told me to!
