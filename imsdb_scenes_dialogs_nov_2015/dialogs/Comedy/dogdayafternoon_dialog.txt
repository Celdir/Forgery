ELTON JOHN

(Amoreena)

AND SHE DREAMS OF CRYSTAL STREAMS OF

DAYS GONE BY WHEN WE COULD LEAN

LAUGHING FIT TO BURST UPON EACH

OTHER...

SONNY

30 seconds, Sal...

HOWARD

Closing time; you want in or out?

SAL

You the manager?

SAL

Just go on talking, like nothing was

happening, okay?

MULVANEY

(into phone)

Listen, lemme call you back.

JACKIE

Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.

SONNY

Jackie - what are you talking about?

JACKIE

Maybe we can take something smaller...

like a Spanish grocery.

SONNY

(indicating what's

happening with Sal

and Mulvaney)

It's too late - just get away from

me - don't talk to me now - go over

to your place...

SYLVIA

(holding sign in front

of her face)

Sorry, this window is shut...

SONNY

Okay, this is a stickup!  Nobody

move!  This is a fucking stickup!

Just freeze now, goddammit!  Get

away from your desk... get in the

center - get in the center!

MULVANEY

Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!

SONNY

(to Jackie, re: Howard)

If he moves - blow his guts out...

Cover him!

JACKIE

I'm sorry, Sonny... I can't make

it...

SONNY

Hey, for christ's sake... now...

fuckin' asshole...

(turns to Sal)

He can't make it.

SAL

Fuck him - let him out!

SONNY

Hey... let him out!

MULVANEY

(yells)

Do what the gentleman says, Howard.

SONNY

Hey, don't take the car!

JACKIE

(on sidewalk)

Well, how'll I get home?

SONNY

Take the subway.  We need the car.

(as Jackie starts to

walk away)

Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!

JACKIE

(points to fig. desk)

Sonny, there's somebody under that

desk over there... I'm sorry...

SONNY

It's okay... it's okay...

SONNY

Lock it.

SONNY

(taps loudly on top

of desk)

Hey... get outta there!  Nobody's

gonna hurt you.

SONNY

Pull the drapes.

SONNY

Pulla drapes!

SONNY

(grinning)

No replay, folks... no alarms...

MULVANEY

(on cross to vault

with Sonny)

We're hip... let's just get you all

fixed up and on your way!

SONNY

Okay, is the vault open?

MULVANEY

I can take care of that.

SONNY

Son of a bitch!

SONNY

What the fuck you tryin' to do?

Trip the alarm?  Use the spur key?

Use the other one...

MULVANEY

I must of been outta my mind.

SONNY

(furious)

Well, you get your mind right.  I'm

a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt

nobody, but goddamn it, don't you

play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?

MULVANEY

Okay.  Let's get you on your way.

Miriam - open the safe.

SONNY

What's the matter with you?

MULVANEY

(to Miriam)

Come on, lemme load you up...

MIRIAM

There isn't any money...

MIRIAM

They picked it up this afternoon...

SONNY

No money?!

(moves inside the

vault)

MIRIAM

There's only about four thousand in

singles, and maybe a few hundred in

larger bills... he's going to kill

us!

SONNY

This is it?  What am I gonna do with

this?  Holy shit!

MULVANEY

It's all we got.

SONNY

Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick

it in the bag...

SONNY

Ah, Jesus...

SAL

Let's go, Sonny.

SONNY

(suddenly gentle)

What are you crying for?  Jesus

Christ.  It's not your fault there's

no money...

MULVANEY

She's afraid you're gonna shoot...

(hands Sonny the bag

of money)

SONNY

What the hell would I shoot her for?

SONNY

Answer the phone!

SONNY

(to Miriam)

Okay... open this.

SONNY

Okay, who's the head teller here?

SYLVIA

I am.

SONNY

Open this up!

SONNY

Don't take it all out!

SONNY

Boy, I can't trust a one of you... I

worked in a bank, I know the alarms,

so don't try to fool around with me!

SONNY

Decoy money, right, it's marked!

Shit!

SONNY

(mimicking Sylvia)

'This window is shut...'

SAL

Cheer up, you'll be the veteran of a

robbery, the bank sends you a dozen

red roses, you know that?

SONNY

(yelling to Sal)

Sal, let him answer the goddamn

phones, they're driving me crazy!

Look at this chicken shit!

SONNY

Hey, you, manager... Don't get any

ideas, fucker... See that man there?

I bark and he bites!

MULVANEY

Believe me, I'm on your side.

SONNY

My side, shit!

SYLVIA

Listen, we got young girls here...

you could watch your language.

SONNY

I speak what I feel.

MULVANEY

Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to

you right now... I suggest you call

during banking hours tomorrow.  What

is your name?

SONNY

Gimme the traveler's checks and the

register.

SONNY

Please... quit that.  It's not

necessary.

MULVANEY

Can you hurry it up?

SONNY

(to Howard)

Hey, you!  Give me the keys...

We're gettin' outta here.

HOWARD

(gasping for breath)

Huh?

MULVANEY

Howard?

HOWARD

Huh?

ON HOWARD

The old man is panicked, great patches

of sweat spreading around his armpits.

He breathes in asthmatic gasps; now

he flinches at his name, as though

he's been hit.

MULVANEY

(stands, receiver

still to ear, then

covering it with his

hand)

Howard, give him the keys...

SONNY

Gimme the keys to get outta here!

SONNY

Sal...

SONNY

Take it easy... just gimme the keys.

I'm not gonna hurt you.  Listen,

calm down, huh?  You're gonna have a

heart attack.  Just gimme the keys...

that's all I want.

SAL

(looking past camera,

falling onto the

floor behind Mulvaney)

Sonny... who's that?  Across the

street.

MULVANEY (O.S.)

(on phone)

No, it was the credit rating.  The

credit rating.  I don't know, you'd

have to find that out from him.

MULVANEY

It was something a couple of years

ago in St. Louis, I don't know...

MULVANEY

It's the insurance guy across the

street.  He probably saw the goddamn

smoke!

(motions toward smoking

register)

Please!  Put out the fire!

MARGARET

I'll get some water!

SONNY

Nobody move! Freeze!

MULVANEY (O.S.)

Sorry... I can't talk now... I'll

call you back.

SAL

Get rid of him.

MULVANEY

Howard, wave him off.  Tell him we're

closed.  Whatever...

SONNY

The gun's right on your back...

MULVANEY

Give me the keys...

MULVANEY

(unlocking door)

What is it, Sam?

SAM

Everything's all right?  You okay?

MULVANEY

Yeah, just a cigarette got in a

wastebasket.

SAM

You all right?

MULVANEY

Little smoke: like a Polish four-

alarm fire, is all.

SAM

Yeah.  Well, you're okay?

MULVANEY

Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.

SAM

Okay.

MULVANEY

Thanks again, Sam.

SAM

I'm glad it's okay.

MULVANEY

It's okay. [Regards to the family,

Sam.]

MULVANEY

For God's sake, will you please go

now?  We gave you every nickel we

got.

SONNY

You're goin' outside with me.  If

there's no cops around, we just split.

Otherwise, you go with us.

SONNY

(to Mulvaney)

Answer it.

SAL

He's gone?

SONNY

Yeah - it's all right... let's go.

MULVANEY

Hello, Mulvaney here...

SONNY

Sal, get 'em in the vault.

SAL

Where's the money?

SONNY

Get 'em in the vault!

MULVANEY

(tired)

What property is that, Mrs. Anterio?

The Third Avenue property - you

already got a second mortgage on.

We discussed it before...

JENNY

(from inside vault

area)

You won't close the vault?  How can

we breathe?

SONNY

No, that's okay... just close the

gate...

SYLVIA

Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll

have to go to the toilet.

SONNY

What's the matter... they never

housebroke you?

SYLVIA

It's not a joke.  I got this terrible

fear of being locked in...

SAL

Goddamn women...

SONNY

Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody

else have to go?

EDNA

Me, too, please.

SAL

You see... now they all gotta go.

SONNY

Wait a minute - I want to check.

SYLVIA

Oh - Maria!

SONNY

Who the hell is that?  God damn it!

What the...

SONNY

What are you trying to pull?

SYLVIA

I forgot she's in here.

SONNY

Come on, nobody's going to the

bathroom - come on...

MULVANEY

(to Sonny)

It's for you.

SONNY

(into phone)

Yeah.

MORETTI (V.O.)

What are you doin' in there?

SONNY

Who's this?

MORETTI (V.O.)

This is Detective Sergeant Moretti,

asshole, we got you completely by

the balls.  You don't believe me,

I'm lookin' you right in the eye.

Right now, I can see you...

SAL

Who is it?

MORETTI (V.O.)

Okay?  Let's be reasonable and not

stupid and not get anybody hurt.

You come to the front door with hands

folded on your head, unnastand?

Nobody's gonna shoot or...

SONNY

(to Sal)

It's the cops.  Shit!

SAL

How'd that happen?

MULVANEY

(backing away from

Sonny)

I swear to God... on my salary, I'm

not gonna be any hero...

SONNY

I took too long.

SAL

It was the fire, asshole!

MULVANEY

I told you, just go, get out when

you could, but no, you just got to

hang around.

SONNY

Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.

SYLVIA

What is it?  Did you just barge in

here... He doesn't have plan.  It's

all a whim.

(sarcastic)

'Rob a bank!  What not?'

SONNY

...Just give me time to think...

MULVANEY

We're all in the barrel together...

SONNY

(into phone)

All right, bastards!  You keep away

from the bank or we start throwing

bodies out the front door one at a

time.  You got that?

MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

I just called to ask Jenny what time

she's gonna get off.

SONNY

Who's this?

MAN (V.O.)

It's her husband.

SONNY

Is there a Jenny here?

SONNY

It's your husband.

JENNY

What do I say?

SONNY

Tell him the truth!  Tell him whatever

you tell him!

SONNY

What a fuckin' comedy!

(into phone)

WNEW plays all the hits.

MORETTI (V.O.)

Listen, first off, is anybody hurt

in there?

SONNY

...But you keep away from the bank

or we start throwing bodies out the

front door one at a time... You got

it?  Okay?

SAL

You mean that?

SONNY

What?

SAL

...The bodies out the door.

SONNY

I want him to think that.

SAL

But do you mean it?

JENNY

He wants to know what time you think

you'll be through.

SONNY

Tell him I don't know.

SONNY

Where's the back door?

MULVANEY

It's locked on the inside.

(beat)

It's through that passageway and to

the right.

MAN (V.O.)

Jenny?

JENNY

He says he doesn't know.  Why don't

you cook whatever's there?

MAN (V.O.)

It looks like a whole roast.

JENNY

Honey, send out for Kentucky fried

chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle

of prunes, and one of the beef.  The

bottles are in the fridge.

MULVANEY

(to Jenny)

Hurry up!

MAN (V.O.)

I know how to fix the bottle.  They

got guns?

JENNY

(with the baby on her

mind)

What guns?

MAN (V.O.)

The robbers in the bank.  They got

guns?

JENNY

Yeah.  A lot of guns.

MAN (V.O.)

Well, stay away from them.  Don't

get close.

JENNY

Oh, yeah, I will...

SONNY

Hey, Jenny - let's go...

JENNY

Hon?  I got to go.

MAN (V.O.)

I love you.

JENNY

Yeah.  Well, I got to go now...

MAN (V.O.)

I'll kiss the baby for you.

JENNY

(past embarrassment)

I love you.

SONNY

Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we

can get outta this thing.  There's a

way outta this.

SAL

Are you serious?  About throwin' a

body outta here if we have to?

SONNY

Well, I stalled him for a while.

When it comes the time, then we'll

work it out.  Okay?

SAL

But do you mean it?... But you just

told him that if worse comes to

worse...

SONNY

I want him to think that.

SAL

But I want to know what you think.

SONNY

We won't have to.

SAL

I'll tell you right now - that I'm

ready to do it.

SONNY

What I want to say is...  everything's

gonna be all right...  if we all

cooperate and we don't, you know...

carry on... I don't know you and you

don't know me...  and what I'm tryin'

to tell you is that if you stay cooled

out, we can work this thing out and

nobody's going to get hurt... believe

me, I don't want to hurt anybody...

Everybody is going to have a chance

to do what they have to do...  she's

gotta go to the bathroom - so you go -

and you can go after... Everybody's

gonna get a chance... Everybody's

gonna get a chance to use the phone...

Let's just take it a step at a time.

SONNY

(to Mulvaney)

Now, you -- what's your name?

MULVANEY

Mulvaney...

SONNY

You and me are checking the other

ways in and out.

SONNY

Let's go to the back door.

(referring to Howard)

How'd that guy get to be a guard?

MULVANEY

Well, they go to guard school.

SONNY

To what... learn how to shoot?

They don't get a gun.

MULVANEY

They make $105 a week to start.

They fold the flag, check the place

out in the morning.  I don't know

what they learn, Sonny.

MULVANEY

Here we are... the back door.

SONNY

They could shoot the lock... I want

to block it, so if they try comin'

here, we're gonna hear it.  Here,

you pull on that side.

(puts gun aside)

SONNY

You got kids?

MULVANEY

I got two kids... and I'd like to

see them again.

SONNY

Ah, I know!  You're being very

cooperative.  I got no complaint

against you whatever; you got bank

insurance?

MULVANEY

You know I do.  You seem to know a

lot about bank procedure.

SONNY

Don't ask me questions.  I got

connections.  You find out who I am,

you're cold meat.

MULVANEY

I don't care who you are...

(shove)

I just want to get you outta here,

safe, right?

SONNY

What if I take you with me?

MULVANEY

(stopping to rest for

a beat, thinking)

If you take anybody, please take me.

SONNY

They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll

shoot you... they don't give a damn.

In spite of that bank insurance.

You see what they did in Attica,

they shot everybody, the hostages,

prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two

people they killed, the innocent

with the guilty.

SONNY

Anyway, I'm not gonna take you.

I'm gonna take one of the girls, a

married one with a couple of kids.

The cops don't like it in the papers

when they kill a mother, especially

if she's got young kids.

SONNY

You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney.

Only don't fuck around with me, you

know what I mean?

MULVANEY

I don't fool around with you.

BULLHORN COP

This is a restricted area.  You are

flying in a restricted area...

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

...police as yet have made no contact

with the bank robbers who are locked

in the bank...

MORETTI

(to no one)

Here comes the FBI.

(to Sheldon)

You men lookin' for protection?  We

got all the police right here.

SHELDON

Why didn't you just wait and try to

take 'em out there in the street?

MORETTI

I made an error in judgment.  I

thought the sons of bitches would be

overwhelmed with remorse at the sight

of a police officer.  And you know

somethin'?  Nobody has said hostage

yet.  Unnastan?

VOICES

How many in the bank?

Have they got hostages?  Any shots

exchanged?

(Etc., AD LIB)

MORETTI

No, we don't know that yet.  This

young fella without the hat is FBI.

I'm Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti

... M-O-R-E-double-T-I.  Eugene.  I

don't give a shit, but my wife cries

if you spell it wrong.

COP

...no, just get hold of Al, tell him

to get the catering truck over to

26th and Avenue B, there's a bank

robbery in progress and big crowd.

Big!  Tell him to bring ice cream --

I got to hang up.

MORETTI

(to phone cop)

You get the phone company?

PHONE COP

It's being set up... this phone'll

be a direct line into the bank.

MORETTI

Okay, you're in there and we're out

here.  What do we do now?

SONNY

I told you -- keep away.  I don't

know what we do now.

MORETTI

Awright, but I wanna talk to you.

First off, we wanna know if the people

in the bank are okay.

SONNY

They're okay.

MORETTI

You alone, or you got confederates?

SONNY

I'm not alone.

MORETTI

How many you got in there?

SONNY

I got Sal.

MORETTI

Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?

SONNY

Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam

veterans so killing don't mean

anything to us, you understand?

MORETTI

Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's

you -- what's your name?

SONNY

What do you want to know that for?

MORETTI

Give me a name, any name, just so I

got somethin' to call you.

SONNY

Call me Sonny-boy.

MORETTI

Sonny-boy, one word?

SONNY

One word.  You won't find it in the

phone book.

MORETTI

Listen, Sonny... can I call you Sonny

for short?

SONNY

Call me whatever you want.

MORETTI

Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the

people in the bank are okay, then

what I want to do is work out a way

to get them out of there.  I want to

come over there, without a gun...

and you can frisk me.  So you can

see you can trust me.  So we can

talk and find a way outta this mess.

SONNY

I frisk you?

MORETTI

You frisk me.

SONNY

Right -- I'm with you, buddy.

MORETTI

I'd like just some sign I can trust

you too, Sonny.  I don't want to

trust my body out where you could

just shoot me.  Some sight... right?

SONNY

Sure... like... I'm not gonna shoot

you.

MORETTI

How about letting the people out of

the bank.  Why put them in this

position?

SONNY

They're what's keeping me alive.

You think you're dealing with an

idiot?  Talk to me then.

MORETTI

Okay, give us the women.

SONNY

Oh, no... Women is all we got.

MORETTI

You're all one way!  I'm bein'

reasonable with you; give me

somethin'... Give me one of them,

anyway... Just one...

SONNY

So -- you want me to send one out

there... Okay.  I'll see what I can

do.

SONNY

(to Sal)

He wants one.

SAL

Dead or alive?

SONNY

Alive.

SONNY

Okay... who's gonna go first?

MULVANEY

It's up to you ladies.

SYLVIA

Howard!

SONNY

To show that we're negotiating.

SAL

All right... send them the guard.

SONNY

All right... let's go.

SAL

Cover her, Sonny.

SYLVIA

He needs the keys.

SAL

(from the rear)

Only one, Sonny.

SYLVIA

Go along, Howard.

MORETTI

Don't fire!

RADIO VOICES

Did he say fire?  What fire?  Do we

fire or what?  Who fired?

(Etc.)

SYLVIA

My God!  That's Howard!  We voted to

send him out!

CAMERAMAN

Hey!  Come out, get in the light.

Hey, out where we can get a shot,

huh?  Who's the black guy?

(etc. AD LIBS)

MORETTI

Get him outta here!

MORETTI

Sonny - come out here a minute.

SONNY

You got these cops outta here.

They're comin' in too close.

MORETTI

Come on.  I want you to see something.

SONNY

You want me to give up, huh?  Look,

Sal's in back with the girls.

Anything happens to me - one move -

and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.

How do I know you won't jump me?

MORETTI

I don't forget about Sal and the

boom boom room.  I want you to see

this.

NEWSMEN AND PHOTOGRAPHERS

Out in the light.  Hey, Lady!  You're

on TV, Lady!  Smile, any...  god

damn thing...

MORETTI

Let Sal come out, take a look.  What

hope you got?  Quit while you're

ahead.  All you got is attempted

robbery.

SONNY

...armed robbery...

MORETTI

Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been

hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody

is gonna worry over kidnapping

charges, the worst you're gonna get

is five years -- you can be out in a

year.

SONNY

Kiss me.

MORETTI

What?

SONNY

(deadpan)

When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be

kissed a lot.

(bursting out)

Who the fuck are you tryin' to con

me into some deal?  You're a city

cop, where's the FBI?  This is a

federal offense, I got kidnapping,

armed robbery, they're gonna bury

me!  You know it, you can't talk for

them, you're some flunky pig tryin'

to bullshit me.  Now God damn it,

get somebody in charge here to talk

to me!

MORETTI

Calm down, you're not...

SONNY

Calm down... look at this, look at

him...!

SONNY

(continuing)

They wanna kill me so bad they can

taste it!

SONNY

(screaming)

Attica!  Attica!  Go ahead!  Blow

off the front of the whole God damn

bank!

SONNY

(to the TV)

If it wasn't for you guys they'd

kill everybody and say it was me and

Sal.

(to Moretti)

You tell 'em to put the guns down.

I can't stand it.

MORETTI

(Cop language command

to put gun away)

All right - put the guns down!

MEDIA

Hey, over here!  Give us a wave!

FAT WOMAN

Vi!  Oh, Jesus.  Vi!  Turn on the

TV, turn the TV on, you can see it's

him.

FAT WOMAN

...I swear to God it looked just

like him!

VI

(as the recognizes

Sonny)

Oh, My God in Heaven!

TV NEWSMAN

...the robber, whose identity is not

known, came out of the bank, with a

hostage, Mrs. Sylvia Ball...

FAT WOMAN

(proud)

Did I tell you?  He looks good!

VI

What's he doin' this for?  He didn't

tell me he needed money.  He would

of told me.

TV NEWSMAN

...Mrs. Ball, is everyone all right

in the bank?

HUSBAND

Why rob a bank when you got a sucker

for a mother?

SYLVIA

Oh, yeah, the one girl was cryin',

but we're havin' a ball, so far, if

just nobody shoots...

VI

Why didn't he tell me?

NEWSMAN

What about the man inside the bank?

What is he doing?

HUSBAND

I just hope he gives the wrong name.

SYLVIA

Sal?  He never talks, only goes:

'Sonny, you want me to shoot that

one, this one.'

HUSBAND

Is that all there is -- that little

bastard down there in the bank?

TV NEWSMAN

Mrs. Ball, do you think they might

shoot, if they get desperate?

VI

You got money for the subway?

SYLVIA

Hey, wait, he's goin' back in.

(she turns OUT OF

PICTURE)

FAT WOMAN

Subway!  It's a special occasion --

take a cab, for God's sake!

SYLVIA

(looking up toward

them)

I gotta go now.

MEDIA (2ND FLOOR)

Hey, lady... you're out now.  Stay

out!

SYLVIA

They're my girls.  They need me in

there.

CUT TO:

SYLVIA

Hey, girls -- I was on television...

MULVANEY

(to passing Sonny)

What about Howard?

SONNY

(to Mulvaney)

Turn on the TV.

GIRLS

What happened?

SONNY

(to Sal)

The whole media is out there... it

looks a lot better for us than it

did before...

TV NEWSMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

We can see the robbers inside the

bank, and we're trying now to

establish contact.

TV NEWSMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

We're on the telephone to the bank

manager, Patrick J. Mulvaney... Mister

Mulvaney...

MULVANEY'S VOICE (V.O.)

Yes, I can hear you.

TV NEWSMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Can you put the robber on the phone?

Will he talk to us?

MULVANEY'S VOICE (V.O.)

You wanna talk to him... Sonny...

SONNY

What?

MULVANEY

The TV... they want to talk to you...

SONNY

(into phone)

Yeah?  Who's this?

WABC TV NEWSMAN

Sir, you're on the air.  I wonder if

you'd answer a few questions.

SONNY

(to Sal)

Hey, Sal...

(to phone)

Sure.

TV NEWSMAN

Why are you doing this?

SONNY

Doing what?

TV NEWSMAN

Robbing a bank.

SONNY

I don't know... It's where they got

the money.  I mean, if you want to

steal, you go to where they got the

money, right?

TV NEWSMAN

But I mean, why do you need to steal?

Couldn't you get a job?

SONNY

Get a job doing what?  You gotta be

a member of a union, no union card -

no job.  To join the union, you gotta

get the job, but you don't get the

job without the card.

TV NEWSMAN

What about, ah, non-union occupations?

SONNY

Like what?  Bank teller?  What do

they get paid -

(now looks over at

girls who offer the

information - $135.37)

they pay one hundred thirty-five

dollars and thirty-seven cents to

start.  I got a wife and kids.  I

can't live on that -- You want to

live on that?  What do you make a

week?

TV NEWSMAN

(swiftly, evasive)

I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not...

SONNY

Wait a minute... I'm talkin' to you.

I'm askin' you a question...

TV NEWSMAN

The audience is interested in you,

Sonny... not me.

SONNY

Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?

You got me and Sal on TV...  we're

entertainment you sell, right?

TV NEWSMAN

You're news, Sonny...

SONNY

How much you have to pay an

entertainer to fill this slot?

TV NEWSMAN

Newsman, not...

SONNY

Okay, newsman.  How much you make a

week?

(beat)

You're not talkin'.  You payin' me?

What have you got for me?  We're

givin' you entertainment... what are

you givin' us?

TV NEWSMAN

What do you want us to give you?

You want to be paid for...

SONNY

I don't want to be paid.  I'm here

with Sal and eight other people...

and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow

our guts out, man!  You're gonna see

our brains onna sidewalk!  How's

that for all you shut-ins and

housewives to look at!  You gonna

help, or you just put it on instead

of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin'

here!  What have you got for me?

TV NEWSMAN

You could give up.

SONNY

Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in

prison?

TV NEWSMAN

Of course not...

SONNY

Then talk about somethin' you fuckin'

know about...

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Ladies and gentlemen, our transmission

has been temporarily interrupted.

Please stand by.

SONNY

Why the hell did he do that?  What

the hell did I do?

MULVANEY

I guess he didn't appreciate your

use of language.  They don't speak

that way on television.  It's a rule.

Do you realize you've cut off a

valuable source of communication?

SONNY

Okay, Sal... what do we do?

SAL

(no answer)

SONNY

I figure maybe we can get the FBI to

make a deal...

SAL

What kind of a deal?

SONNY

Maybe we can get outta this thing

alive... get 'em to drop the

kidnapping charges...

SAL

What do you mean?  You talkin' about

coppin a plea?

SONNY

(starts to speak, but

Sal interrupts)

SAL

...because if you're talking about

coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right

now, there's no deal... I'm never

going back to prison... We got our

own deal already... Do you remember

the pact we made?  You and me and

Jackie - that night in the bar... we

were talkin' about if we get trapped

in the bank, what are you gonna do...

Right?  What did we say?  What did

we say!

SONNY

We'd kill ourselves.

SAL

Does that still go?

SONNY

We're not there yet.

SONNY

You're on the phone!

1ST CRANK (V.O.)

Kill them all.  Now.

SONNY

Kill them all now?  You fuckin' creep!

Don't call here again!

SONNY

You see what we're dealing with?

They want me to kill all of you!

MULVANEY

What now, Sonny?

SONNY

Wait a minute... I've been looking

at this all wrong... Let's look at

it the other way...

SONNY

Look, we gotta get a jet outta here...

outta the country.  We gotta get a

helicopter.  Okay, Sal?  We get a

helicopter on the roof to take us to

the jet and we fly to the sunny

Caribbean.  Algeria.  We got to look

at the bright side.  We got 'em by

the balls, we got the hostages, we

can get anything we want.  They gotta

give it to us.

SONNY

(into phone)

Get me Moretti.

SONNY

We're all gonna get outta here.

You're all gonna be all right.  I'm

gonna ask for a helicopter and a

jet... and we're gonna get outta

here alive... You've all been all

right with me and as long as it stays

that way, then things are gonna be

all right - as long as you

cooperate...

(into phone)

Moretti, I want to talk to you.  I'm

comin' out.

SONNY

You realize, Sal, that we're gonna

get outta the country, so if you

wanna talk to somebody, do it now...

You gotta Mother or a Father?

Friends?

(Sal nods no)

If we gotta be outside the country,

where do you wanna go?  Any country.

Just name a country.

SAL

Wyoming.

SONNY

(stopped for a moment)

Wyoming... That's not out of the

country -- that's in the United

States... Look, I'll be back.

SAL

Sonny!  Gimme the gun.  You don't

need that.

SONNY

Put them down.

MORETTI

Sonny, ya want somethin'?

MORETTI

Who the hell is that?

MORETTI

(to Maria's boy friend)

Hey!  What the fuck you tryin' to

do?  You don't think the whole police

department can do the job?

MARIA'S BOY FRIEND

I think he's got Maria in there, and

I see blood, man!  I wanta jam him

up...

MORETTI

Jesus, the Spanish!  You gotta do it

yourself, right?  Eye for an eye!

Go wan get outa here, we'll take

care of her.

(turns to Sonny)

You okay, Sonny?  Boy, he hung a

couple good ones on you there!

MULVANEY

(from door; alarmed)

Sal wants to see Sonny.  He says

he'll shoot unless he can see Sonny.

SONNY

It's okay, Sal.

SONNY

(continuing; hurt,

wondering)

He wanted to kill me!

MORETTI

It's okay, you got a lot of

protection.

SONNY

I want a helicopter to get outa here!

And a jet to take us to...

(cagey)

...wherever we want to go.  Outa the

country, so no little jets.  A big

one with a bar and a piano lounge.

MORETTI

I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know

if the helicopters can land in here.

I'll have to check it out.  I got

superiors, unnerstan?  They don't

always see eye to eye with me.  I'll

do what I can.

MORETTI

(continuing)

Sonny, be reasonable!

SONNY

I want to see my wife.  I want you

to bring her down here.

MORETTI

Okay, what do you give me?

SONNY

What do you want?

MORETTI

The girl hostages.

SONNY

Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage

when you bring my wife, and one for

the helicopter, one for the jet, and

the rest can come home on the jet.

MORETTI

(kiss)

I'll see what they'll do.

MORETTI

Okay, you pick out who you're gonna

give us.  Where's your wife?

RADIO

...the leader of the pair, a Vietnam

veteran, Sonny Abramowicz, has

demanded in return for releasing one

of the hostages that police allow

his wife to visit him at the bank.

Police spokesman...

HEIDI (V.O.)

The transistor goes Sonny what?  I

couldn't believe my ears, so I shut

the transistor, get outta here, who

needs this?  I say Sonny didn't do

it.  It's not him to rob a bank.

It's not him to hurt anybody, to

threaten anybody, to steal or do

anything wrong.  'Cause he's never

done nothin' wrong from the day I

know him.

CUT TO:

HEIDI (V.O.)

...Only he tells me this and he tells

me that, he's with the Mafia, I say,

Sonny, where do you get the money,

you're on welfare, how can you rent

a new Eldorado, red, you don't like

the color you rent a yellow.

HEIDI

So night before last we're at Coney

Island, he's on the rides with the

kids, an' I have this habit of goin'

in glove compartments an' all, an' I

see...

HEIDI

this gun with bullets in there, an'

I go to myself, oh God, Sonny!  That's

all I had to see, I didn't say

anything.

HEIDI

(continuing)

And things are adding in my head,

how crazy he's been acting, and in

with a bad crowd, an' I look at him,

he's yellin' at the kids like a

madman.  So inna car I said to him,

Sonny, what you gonna do with the

gun?  You gonna shoot me and dump my

body inna river or what?  I was so

scared of him, I never been scared

of Sonny never.  You know, his mother

says the cops was always at our house,

we was always fighting.  I hit him

with the jack in the car once, but I

only missed and hit myself, you should

of seen my leg.  And all he would

ever do is put on his coat and go

out.  So they say it's Sonny but I

don't believe it.

COP 1

Lady, you saw him.  You saw his gun.

HEIDI

He might of done it, his body

functions might of done it, but not

he himself.

SONNY

Let's say I put a gun to your head

and I tell you to kill a cop...  and

you did.  Who'd go to the electric

chair... you or me?

MARIA

You would... you told me to do it.

SONNY

But you shot him.

MIRIAM

(joining in)

But you told her to.

SONNY

Yeah - But you did it.

JESUS FREAK (V.O.)

Jesus Christ is coming back and he's

really pissed.

SONNY

(gently)

Yeah, well I don't blame him.

JESUS FREAK (V.O.)

You know, Sonny, I used to dope a

lot, and I was into dipping?  And I

did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord

Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved

me, you know how?

SONNY

No.  Look, we're kind of....

JESUS FREAK (V.O.)

That's why I can talk to you, as an

equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your

whole soul with God.  And then you

are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.

SONNY

Yeah, well... maybe you better talk

to one of these others, okay?

JESUS FREAK (V.O.)

Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can

help you save your soul ...

SYLVIA

The air conditioning is off or

something.

(Looks at Margaret)

she's sick.

SONNY

Where's the air conditioning?

MULVANEY

I don't know, Sonny... on the roof

somewhere I guess.

SONNY

(improv. about going

out back to find the

air conditioning

mechanism)

Sonny moves toward Sal in the

Conference room.  Mulvaney follows

discreetly behind him.

SONNY

Sal, I'm gonna take a look at the

air conditioning.

SONNY

(to Mulvaney)

Do you think we can turn it on?

MULVANEY

I don't know.

SAL

Sonny -

SONNY

Yeah...

SAL

I never been up in a plane before.

SONNY

It's nothing - it just goes up -

it's the safest thing in the world.

Safer than a car.  Don't worry about

it, Sal - it'll be all right...

they're great...

MULVANEY

It's gonna be up there.

SONNY

What's that?

SONNY

(whispering)

They're trying to come through the

door!

SAL

(to Edna)

Everybody!  Back here!

MULVANEY

Sonny, if you shoot, shoot high...

my car's parked out there.

SAL

(to group)

Get over here!  Get over here!

RADIO NETWORK (V.O.)

What's happening?  He shot through

the door.  Is he coming out?  Can

you see in...

(Etc., etc.)

MORETTI

(on bullhorn)

Sonny!

LOUTS

Sonny!

MORETTI

Sonny!

CROWD

(echoing)

Sonny!

MORETTI & CROWD

Sonny!

SONNY

(inside bank)

What the hell you doin' back there?

MORETTI

Sonny, come on out!

SONNY

Sal, watch 'em... I'm goin' out.

SONNY

What the fuck do you want?

MORETTI

They were...

SONNY

You tryin' to fuck me?

MORETTI

No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.

SONNY

So, what were they doin'?  You're

tellin' me you had nothin' to do

with that back there?

MORETTI

I swear to God I had nothing to do

with it...

SONNY

Bullshit... I don't walk to talk to

you...

MORETTI

Wait a minute... everything you asked

for is on the way...

SONNY

Yeah...

MORETTI

Is on its way... The helicopter can't

land but we got a bus... the jet's

on its way to Kennedy... we got a

bus coming here...

SONNY

You're full of shit...

MORETTI

Sonny, your wife's on the way...  We

reached her... your wife's on the

way... everything you asked for, you

got.

SONNY

Well, what were you doin' back there?

MORETTI

It can't happen again... I'll do

everything I can to stop anything I

can...

SONNY

You know, you're telling me that a

helicopter can't land here...

MORETTI

Can't land... you'd kill people...

SONNY

Don't fuck with me...

MORETTI

I'm not... I'm not... you're gettin'

a bus... you're gettin' a bus... the

jet's comin' into Kennedy... and

your wife's on the way... what else

do you need?  What else can I get

you?  Listen, I don't know how you

can do better...  see that man over

there... the FBI guy...

SONNY

Just one more explosion like that

and you're gonna see a dead body...

MORETTI

There won't be... there won't be...

What else do you need?  How else can

we help you?

SONNY

All right... I got some hungry people

in there... I want to get some

pizza... some stuff like that...

MORETTI

What else?

SONNY

Cokes, seven-ups...

(Moretti repeats)

also some aspirin...

MORETTI

Aspirins... okay you got it.

(turns behind him to

a near-by cop)

Charlie!  Six pizzas!

SONNY

Okay...

SONNY

Okay... okay... all right, Sal, it's

okay.  I got everything straightened

out... it's gonna be okay.

SAL

Get over there!

SONNY

Look, I talked to him and it's not

going to be a helicopter - they can't

land on top of the roof - so they're

comin' with a big...  limousine bus

and they'll take us to the airport -

and they're gonna get a jet... so

things are rollin'...  They're

movin'... I also ordered some food...

I got some pizzas for us, all right?

I got some things to drink - I got

sodas... I even asked them for

aspirins... I'm doin' what I can...

now I gotta pay for the pizza...

where are the marked bills?

MULVANEY

Are we going to get the ball rolling?

SONNY

What are you talking about?  What do

you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin'

the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these

people happy... I'm keeping you

happy... I gotta keep the cops cooled

out... I gotta do everything... I

on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm

workin' on it... Jesus Christ!  I

ideas... you want me to give you the

gun?  You want to take it over?

DELIVERY BOY

You the guy wanted the pizza?

DELIVERY BOY

It's paid for.

(looks at Moretti;

Moretti nods)

SONNY

Keep the change...

CROWD AD LIBS

Hey, over here!  Hey, robber!  How

about a thousand!  Throw some over

here!  Hey, no shit, I need an

operation, I don't even have a job...

(Etc.)

SONNY

Okay - Chow!

SONNY

You eat it first.  I don't know if

they put something in it.

COMMISSIONER

Gene -- you smilin'?

MORETTI

No.  I never smile any more.

COMMISSIONER

Whattaya think: we gonna kill any

civilians tonight, Gene?

MORETTI

I never make bets or guesses, that

way I'm never wrong and I never have

to pay out.

COMMISSIONER

Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!

MORETTI

So whatsa deal?

COMMISSIONER

They jet's comin' out.  But don't

let 'em off the ground.

MORETTI

What if we gotta kill a whole lot of

people?

COMMISSIONER

Don't let 'em off the ground.

MORETTI

Listen.

COMMISSIONER

(anticipating)

If you're right I'm gonna back you a

hundred percent, you know that.

MORETTI

(pleasantly)

Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I

don't need you.  What I want is -

if I make an honest mistake I want

help.

JENNY

...well, just pick him up and hold

him.  No, he's not spoiled, he's

just got to settle his stomach after

eating.  He's used to me feeding me,

that's all.

SYLVIA

Somebody give me a cigarette.

MARIA

Sylvia, you don't smoke.

SYLVIA

I never smoked before in my life but

I got a right to start now if I want

to.

SAL

You don't smoke... why do you want

to start now.

SYLVIA

Because I'm scared, that's why.

You never smoked?

SAL

I used to, but I stopped.

SYLVIA

You stopped?  Why?

SAL

Because I don't want cancer.

SYLVIA

You don't want cancer?  You're about

to get your head blown off, you're

worried about cancer.

(to Maria)

Gimme the cigarette.

SAL

No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you

understand?  You're pure!

SYLVIA

Pure?

SAL

You shouldn't start now.

SYLVIA

For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta

this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop...

okay?

SAL

Go ahead.  Do what you want to do.

I hate to see you break a perfect

record.  You oughta take care of

your body.

SYLVIA

My body?  What for?

SAL

Your body is the temple of the Lord.

SYLVIA

(staring at him)

You're serious!

SAL

You're really pure, you know?  You

got a perfect record.  You never

used that stuff to ruin your body,

why start now?

SYLVIA

You know, you remind me of my 19-

year-old brother - only he's got his

hair down to his knees - he looks

like something that eats berries and

roots out of the ground.  God forbid

I should say something to him like,

'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana,

just remember that it's illegal' and

he storms outta the house.  You rob

a bank, but you keep your body pure,

is that it?

SAL

You gonna smoke the cigarette?

SYLVIA

Yes...

SYLVIA

(calling to him)

Sal... If I die of cancer it's going

to be half your fault.

SAL

(exiting)

No - it's because you're weak.

MULVANEY

(overlapping Janet

into phone)

Mulvaney...

(listens)

JANET

(into phone)

I don't know.

MULVANEY

(to Sonny)

It's for you.  Moretti.

SONNY

Yeah?

MORETTI

We're bringing in your wife...

SONNY

(gives him gun)

They've got my wife.  They're bringing

her in.

CUT TO:

SONNY

Leon!  Leon!  Over here!  Happy

Birthday, Leon!

MORETTI

(to cop driver)

What's that?

COP DRIVER

We went to the hospital, where he

told us - and asked for his wife.

He...

(indicates Leon)

...says they got married in a church.

MORETTI

Jesus!

SONNY

Leon!  Happy Birthday!

SONNY

(into phone)

Get me Moretti!

COP ON PHONE

Moretti - he wants to talk to you.

SONNY

Is he all right?  Is he all right?

MORETTI (V.O.)

He's all doped up.

SONNY

I want to talk to him.

MORETTI (V.O.)

He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him

on his feet and he'll call you back.

(hangs up)

MORETTI

Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you

a shot down the hospital or what?

LEON

Oh, God, they shot me with like

unreal!

MORETTI

Well, you got to get hold of yourself.

You got to talk to him, tell him to

give himself up.

LEON

Oh no!

MORETTI

He's got eight people in there with

him.  He's got this kid with him...

they're gonna shoot the people.

LEON

I can't help it.  I can't stop him

from anything.

MORETTI

If he won't listen to you, who will

he listen to?

LEON

He won't listen to anybody.  He's

been very crazy all summer.  Since

June he's been trying to kill me.

MORETTI

You try calling the police?

LEON

What good is that?  They couldn't

stop him.  And it'd just make him

mad.  They don't know him.

MORETTI

Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.

LEON

He was under great strain: you don't

understand, he's a very mixed up

person.

MORETTI

He's makin' threats in there.

LEON

He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never

met anyone like him.  His wife, he's

a wonderful father to his children.

His mother - you should see her -

his mother and father together are

like a bad car wreck - he lets it

all slide off his back, he sees them,

he pays their rent.  Unbelievable.

I wanted to get married... He didn't

really want it... he's married

already!  But he did it.  I don't

know why.  I thought it would help

me, but it didn't.  I was just as

confused and unhappy was before; I

did terrible things.

MORETTI

What kind of things, Leon?

LEON

Ten days I spent in Atlantic City -

Sonny was frantic - he knew I was

drinking; he didn't know where I

was... who I was with.  I couldn't

explain why I did the things I did.

So I went to this psychiatrist who

explained to me I was a woman in a

man's body.  So Sonny right away

wanted to get me money for a sex

change operation: but where was he

to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God,

he's in hock up to his ears already.

MORETTI

He needed money?  For the operation

for you?

LEON

It made him crazy - so much demand,

he'd fly into this rages.  And I got

more depressed than ever; I saw I'd

never get the operation.  So I tried

to take my life - I swallowed about

a half pound of pills...  blues,

reds, yellows, downers, uppers,

screamers... you name it.  But I

just threw them up and wound up in

the hospital.  Sonny comes there and

looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'

So when I hear he's in the bank, I

almost go crazy because I know he's

doin' it for me.

MORETTI

Well, don't you figure you owe to

him to get him out of there?

LEON

I can't talk to him.

MORETTI

You're in it up to your ass, Leon.

You're an accessory.  You talk him

out of there and they might be a

little more understanding of your

case.

LEON

I'm afraid.

MORETTI

How is he gonna hurt you on the

telephone?

LEON

I don't know what to say to him.  I

can't.

MORETTI

You think it over, Leon.

MORETTI (V.O.)

He won't talk to you.  Let me work

on it.

TV NEWSMAN

...police are questioning Leon, a

year-old admitted homosexual, who

claims to have been married to one

of the bank robbers in a ceremony

last November... [etc.]...

TV NEWSMAN

Our coverage of the Brooklyn robbery

where two homosexuals are holding

hostages for their demands of a

helicopter, a jet, and safe passage

out of the country...

SAL

Sonny, you hear that?

SONNY

What?

SAL

They keep sayin' two homosexuals.

I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to

stop them saying that.

SONNY

That's all they're interested in -

it's a freak show to them.  I can't

control it, Sal - let'em say what

they want.  Forget it.  It don't

matter.

SONNY

Where's the god-damn jet?  They're

always flying overhead - going

somewhere.

SAL

That's it, Sonny.

MORETTI (V.O.)

Sonny... Sonny... Come out a minute...

Come out a minute...

SHELDON

We're all set at Kennedy.

MORETTI

What makes you think you'll be able

to control it?

SHELDON

He's totally unstable.  He'll make a

mistake.

MORETTI

He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who

can make a mistake.  That's what

scares the shit out of me.

SHELDON

Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal.

Why don't I take it over now?

CUT TO:

SONNY

Moretti?  What the fuck is goin' on?

SONNY

Get the lights back on!

SONNY

Sal - it's the FBI... I'm goin' back

out to talk to him.

SONNY

What is this?  The FBI?  Jesus, now

we're talkin', maybe we can get this

thing moving.

SONNY

First off, get the lights back on

and the air conditioning.

SHELDON

(showing ID)

No more favors.  That's all over,

Sonny.

SONNY

(sarcastically)

Aw, Jesus... you been doin' us favors

all night!

SHELDON

I've got a jet.  I'll have airport

limousine here in a half hour.  I

want the hostages.

SONNY

Bullshit!

SHELDON

I'd like to work with you on this,

not against you.

SONNY

Well, Jesus, these hostages are

keeping me alive.

SHELDON

Okay, when do I get them?

SONNY

At the airport.  We get on the plane,

check it out, and if it's all okay

we'll send them out.  Except one.

SHELDON

I want them all.

SONNY

I want to talk to Leon.

SHELDON

I want to come in, and see if

everybody's okay.

SONNY

You got guts.  You think if Sal and

me have cut their throats we're gonna

let you out?

SHELDON

I have to see.

SONNY

It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.

SAL

Have him walk in backwards.

SONNY

Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.

SHELDON

I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I

have to.

SONNY

Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that

kills me, I want him to do it because

he hates my guts.  Not because it's

a job.  Okay, let's go... but you

gotta walk in backwards.

SONNY

Nobody give their right name...

it's the FBI!

SHELDON

I just want to see all you young

ladies are all all right in here.

SYLVIA

Listen, we asked for the jet hours

ago, what are you doin' out there?

SHELDON

(his eyes on Sal)

It's all being set up, we'll have

you out of here in a couple of hours.

SYLVIA

(to Sheldon)

Just give them what they want.

SHELDON

They're getting what they want.  We

just want to be sure we get what we

want, which is to get all you ladies

out safe.  And you two boys, too.

SAL

(to Sheldon)

You got to talk to the TV, tell them

to stop talking about the two

homosexuals.  I'm not gay...  that's

the truth.  Tell 'em that.

SHELDON

I will.

(he turns to Sonny)

Sonny?  Outside for a minute?

SONNY

Sal?

SAL

They gotta stop sayin' that.

SHELDON

Sonny, you handled yourself real

well.  A lot of men would have choked,

and we'd have a lot of chaos and

panic and maybe a death or a multiple

death on our hands, but you handled

it.  I respect that.  Don't you try

to take Sal.  We'll handle him.  You

just sit tight and you won't get

hurt.

SONNY

Wait a minute!  What the fuck you

tryin' to tell me?

SHELDON

(quiet)

What I said.  You just sit quiet and

we'll handle Sal.

MORETTI

The little bastard miss me?

SAL

What'd he say?

SONNY

He was talkin' about arrangements...

we were talkin' about the TV.

SAL

Why couldn't he talk about that here?

SONNY

He was showin' me how the airport

bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.

(notices Mulvaney

start to faint)

What's wrong with him?

SONNY

Hey, you okay?

SYLVIA

He's got diabetes.  He's not a well

person.

SONNY

Those bastards -- they poisoned the

pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any

pizza!?

MULVANEY

I didn't eat any pizza.

SYLVIA

I told you, he's got diabetes.

SONNY

You're supposed to balance your sugar

diet, right?

SONNY

Hey!  Is there a doctor over there?

Get him over here!  Come on, on the

double!

SHELDON

What's wrong?

SONNY

The manager, he's diabetic, he's

lookin' bad.

SHELDON

Doctor...

SONNY

Sal - the Doctor's coming in.

SONNY

(to Doctor)

You go on in...

SHELDON

(picks up the phone)

I've convinced Leon to talk to you.

He's on the phone now.

SONNY

Hello.  Hello, Leon.

LEON

Hello, Sonny.

SONNY

How are you doing?

LEON

Well... I'm out of the hospital.

SONNY

(pleased)

Yeah.  You said... I thought you

were never getting out?

LEON

I never thought I'd get out this

way.  I'll tell you.

SONNY

Well... huh...

LEON

Ooohh...

SONNY

Oh... huh... how you feeling?

LEON

I'm really shakey.

SONNY

Well, you know... Moretti told me

before that you were drugged up.

LEON

Yeah.  It was terrible.

SONNY

That... huh... they just shoot you

with drugs.

LEON

You come in and they say, right away,

that you are crazy.  And they start

putting things in your arm...  you

know.  How do they expect you to get

uncrazy if you're asleep all the

time?

SONNY

Yeah...

LEON

You can't talk or do anything.  You

really feel... you know... I'm just

sort of coming out of it now.

SONNY

(pensive)

So... that sure is something.

LEON

Yeah.  So how are you?

SONNY

(chuckling)

Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble.

That is... now I am!

LEON

(chuckling)

Yeah... I know.

SONNY

I don't know what I'm gonna do...

you know.  Boy... I'm dying.

LEON

What?  What are you talking about?

You are dying?  Did you ever listen

to yourself when you say that?

SONNY

What are you talking about?

LEON

What do you mean... what am I talking

about?  Do you realize that you say

that to me every day of your life?

I am dying.  Do you know... do you

realize the death that you are

spreading around to the people who

are around you?

SONNY

Now don't give me that deep shit

now.  Don't start with that shit.

LEON

No really... I don't think that you

realize what it means.  The things

that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun

to somebody's head...

SONNY

I don't know what I'm doing.

LEON

(annoyed)

Yeah... obviously you don't... when

you put a gun to somebody's head...

and you say go to sleep so that it

won't hurt when I pull the trigger.

Death?  Don't talk about death to

me.  I have been living with death

for the last six months.  Why do you

think I'm in the hospital?  I take a

handful of pills to get away from

you.  And then here I am out of the

hospital talking to you on the

phone... again.  I have no friends

left.  No job.  I can't live.  I

have to live with people.  This death

business... I'm sorry!

SONNY

I'm not on the phone to talk to you

about that.  Well, I don't know what

to say, Leon.  When you gimme that...

when you hit me with that shit.  I

mean, what am I supposed to say?

LEON

(indifferent to Sonny)

I'm sorry...

SONNY

I told you.  That I got a lot of

pressures.  You said to me that you

needed money, and I knew that you

needed money!  I saw you there lying

in the hospital like that...  and I

said... shit, man, I got to get this

guy some money.

LEON

(excited)

But I didn't ask you to go rob a

bank.

SONNY

(getting louder)

All right.  I know you didn't ask

me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.

LEON

Well...

SONNY

I did it on my own.  I did this all

on my own.  I ain't laying it on

anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll

tell you something, though, it's

about time that I squared away my

accounts... you know.  I am squaring

away my accounts with life.  Maybe

this whole thing is gonna end,

somehow.  Maybe it'll just end!

Maybe I'll just close my eyes and

the whole fucken thing will be over.

That would be all right too!  I

said... I thought I would square it

away with you... you know?  That I

would get you down here and that I

would say so long to you... or, if

you wanted... you know, to take a

trip...

LEON

What trip?

SONNY

I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm

not going to stay here and I'm not

giving up.  I mean, huh, they're

going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck

it!  But, if I can get out of this...

I am going to get out.  And, how I'm

going to do it is to get a jet out

of here and I'm flying the fuck out...

That's all, Leon.  If you want to

come with me, then you're entitled...

you can come.  You're free to do

what you want.

LEON

I'm free to do what I want?  And you

think I would want to go with you

some place on a plane?  Where?

Where ya going?

SONNY

I gotta jet coming here and we're

gonna try to get the fuck outta this

thing.  And we're gonna go, man!

LEON

You're crazy.

SONNY

That's it.

LEON

You're really crazy.

SONNY

I know!

LEON

Where you gonna go?

SONNY

Who the fuck knows?  I think we're

gonna go... we worked it out to

Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll

go to Algeria.

LEON

Why you going to Algeria?

SONNY

Huh... I don't know.  They got Howard

Johnson's there.  I don't know why

the fuck I'm going there for.

LEON

Howard Johnson's... you're warped.

You know that?  You're really warped!

SONNY

I know that.  I'm warped... I'm

warped!

LEON

(stuttering)

God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a

bunch of... they walk around there...

God!  People walk around with masks

and things on their heads.  They're

a bunch of crazy people there.

SONNY

What am I supposed to do?

LEON

(bitchy)

I don't know... you could have picked

a better place.

SONNY

Denmark?  Sweden?

LEON

(pleased)

I like that... yeah!

SONNY

Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told

him it wasn't a country.  We gotta

get outta the country!  To hell with

a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming

is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what

kind of a shape I'm in?

LEON

So!  Sal is with you?

SONNY

Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.

LEON

Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really

into one mess now.

SONNY

I know I am.  I know!

LEON

(making fun of Sonny)

Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!

SONNY

He ain't going out.  And if I go out

he's just gonna kill the people.

There's a lot of lives that I'm

responsible for... that's all.  So,

I can't do anything.  I got myself

into this mess and I'll get myself

out of it... the best way I know

how!  One of the ways is not giving

up.  I'm telling ya!

LEON

Would you do something for me?

Please?

SONNY

What?

LEON

These guys that got me down here,

you know, huh... they think that I'm

part of this whole thing.  They think

I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!

SONNY

How did they think that?  What are

they... crazy?  What do you mean.

That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving

you a fucken story.

LEON

Well... they told me that I was an

accomplice...

SONNY

Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's

a snow job.  Don't listen to that

shit!

LEON

I gotta listen to it if they think...

SONNY

Shit...

LEON

I can't survive in prison, Sonny...

SONNY

All right.  Then what do you want me

to say?

LEON

Sonny, would you please just tell

them... please...

SONNY

Where are they now?  Just tell me...

are they on the phone now?

LEON

(meekly)

Yeah.

SONNY

(annoyed)

That's great.  Just terrific.  You

talk to me with them on the phone,

right?  That is really smart.  And,

you don't tell me?

LEON

I don't have a choice.

SONNY

You don't have a choice?

LEON

No!  They're standing all around me.

Seven thousand fucken cops... all

around me.

SONNY

Look... who's on the phone?

LEON

Look... don't throw that on me.

SONNY

Who's on the phone, now?  What do

you mean... throw it on you?  You

knew it, right?

LEON

Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice

do I have?  I'm in the hospital;

they drag me out of the hospital...

bring me down here...

SONNY

All right, enough!  Who the fuck is

on the phone... anyway?  Is that you

Moretti?

(angrily into phone)

You on the phone?  Will somebody

talk to me?

LEON

They won't talk to you.

SONNY

Are they on the phone still?

LEON

Yeah... yeah!

SONNY

(still angry)

All right!  He didn't do it.  All

right?  Now... would you get the

fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that

really changed them, huh?

(calmly to Leon)

Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?

LEON

Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going

to go back, Sonny, to the hospital.

They're really nice people.  They're

really trying to help me.

SONNY

That's good then.  You've found

something.

LEON

Well... I don't know if I have or

not.

SONNY

Do you still want the operation?

LEON

(moody)

Yeah... yeah.

SONNY

Well, then...

LEON

It's my only chance!

SONNY

I don't know what to say to ya!  I

guess I just wanted to say I'll see

ya... or whatever.

LEON

Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.

SONNY

Right.  See you sometime.

LEON

Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?

SONNY

Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha.

I don't know.  Life is funny!

LEON

You said a mouthful... sweetheart!

SONNY

(into phone)

You cut off incoming, gimme a line.

I want to talk to my wife, I want to

say goodbye to my kids.

(line is connected,

he begins to dial;

anguished; to the

group)

Here I am, I could call, and they'd

put anybody on the phone, the Pope,

an astronaut, the wisest of the wise

and who do I have to call?

(to phone; as she

answers)

Heidi?

HEIDI

(on phone; excited)

Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!

SONNY

What about the kids?

HEIDI

They don't know, I sent them to the

neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not

like you.  I can't believe, because

you never hurt anybody since the day

I knew you.

SONNY

Heidi, I'm dying.

HEIDI

(oblivious)

I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you

been tense, like something is

happening; the night before last

you're yellin' at the kids like a

madman, believe me.  And then you

wanted me to go on this ride with

the kids, this caterpillar about

from here to there - fulla one-year-

old kids.  It's ridiculous.  I'm not

about to go on this ride, so you

yell right there, 'You pig, get on

the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything

fell outta - me - my heart, my liver

fell to the floor - you name it!

Yellin' at me in front of all those

people.  Because you never talked

and I never been scared of you, never.

I think: he's gonna shoot me and

dump my body in the river.

SONNY

Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up!

Will you shut your fucking mouth and

listen?!

HEIDI

(afraid)

See?  You're screaming with the

language and all!  A person can't

communicate with you.  You become a

stranger in your own home...

HEIDI

...because you hurt me, God how you

hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying

another man?  Did I do something to

make you do that?  Did I ever turn

you down, or anything?  The only

thing I couldn't do, you're gonna

laugh, is go on top - I got this

fear of high places!

(giggles)

And I let myself get fat.

SONNY

Don't call yourself fat.

HEIDI

I know you can't stand me to say I'm

fat.  Like I can't stand you being a

bank robber.  I guess that's what

love is -- huh, Sonny?

SONNY

(weakly)

Heidi - why didn't you come down

here?

HEIDI

Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna

get shot or whatever.  You oughta

see it on TV, the guns, the cops,

they got cannon, machine guns, they're

loaded with gear.

SONNY

They're not after you, they're after

me.

HEIDI

Listen, it's late already when I

realize it's not just a couple of

ordinary faggots, it's just you and

Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.

DOCTOR

Listen - I think I better take him

back for a cardiac check ...

SONNY

Anything... what's wrong?  Is he

gonna die?

DOCTOR

No, I just think...

MULVANEY

I'm okay... I'm okay...

SONNY

You know more than the Doctor?

You're not okay, look at you.  Come

on...

(to Doctor)

...let's get him out...

MULVANEY

I'm not going.  I'm okay.

SONNY

Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.

MULVANEY

I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed

the insulin.  I'm used to it.

Go on.  Go on.

SONNY

(to Doctor)

You tell me.  Is he endangering his

health, because if you tell me he

is, I'll get him out.

MULVANEY

I'll be God damned if you will.

SONNY

Oh, Jesus!  You want to be a martyr

or a hero or what?

MULVANEY

I don't wanta be either, I just want

to be left alone.  You understand

that?  I wish the fuck you never

came in my bank, that's all, don't

try to act like you're some angel of

human kindness!

(he crosses toward

Tellers' cages to

start straightening

up)

SONNY

Here, my man.  Whattayou get for a

house call?

SONNY

(continuing)

No, no!  I want a top specialist for

my friend, I expect to pay top money.

WE LOVE YOU LOVE YOU SONNY

SONNY

My kids... Kimmy and Jimmy.

SYLVIA

They're beautiful...

SONNY

(as Mulvaney looks at

pictures)

I'll never see them again, Mister

Mulvaney.

MULVANEY

They look like good kids.

SONNY

They're like any others but they're

special to me.  You got kids?  You

told me; you got two.

MULVANEY

Special to me, too.

SONNY

You like me?

MULVANEY

Sure - we like you.

SONNY

No you don't.

MULVANEY

You seem like a likable enough guy.

It's hard to judge.

SONNY

Hey, Sal... How you doin'?

SAL

Okay.

SONNY

(referring to Sal)

You know, I don't know him very well -

but he's not gay... and he's not

going back to prison...  One time

when he was in prison, they gang-

banged him; 13 years old and eight

guys gave it to him...  So Sal isn't

goin' back to prison, no way.

MULVANEY

I'm sorry.

SONNY

You know... I like you people...

I really do.

MULVANEY

We like you, too.

SONNY

You know - I had a job once.  I used

to work in a bank.  I had been

training... I used to have a boss...

Mr. Don Frio... he wore a toupee...

I wonder if you'd hire me if I came

in here and asked you for a job...

MULVANEY

Would I hire you?

SONNY

Yeah.

MULVANEY

Why not?

SONNY

(grinning)

I don't think so.

SONNY

I told you -- they're sending a jet.

It's all worked out...

SYLVIA

Somebody give me another cigarette.

SYLVIA

I wish somebody would tell me I'm

gonna live long enough for it to be

a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay.

My husband, he'll be okay.  I even

know who the bum is gonna marry.

Terrific.  She'll take good care of

him.

MULVANEY

Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my

language back there.

MULVANEY

Ladies... I want to apologize for my

language back there.

(he walks over to his

desk, sits down)

SYLVIA

(amazed)

What'd you say?  I didn't hear you

say anything.

JENNY

He said the 'F' word.

EDNA

What?

JENNY

The 'F' word.  He did.  He said the

'F' word.

SONNY

What's so funny?

EDNA

Well, I'm a Christian, and my ears

are not garbage cans.

SAL

Who's that?

SHELDON (V.O.)

Sonny!  Could you come out, please?

Could you come out, please?

SONNY

It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?

SONNY

What do you want here, Ma?  You could

of watched it on TV.

VI

My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - -

Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3

networks!

SONNY

Mom - I got it all worked out; it's

over.  The best thing is you go home.

Watch it on TV.

VI

I talked to the FBI, I told them

about you, they said if you just

come outta the bank it's gonna be

okay.

SONNY

You did what?  Who did you talk to?

What for?

VI

Well, I'm only trying to get you

outta this.  I told them you were in

Vietnam, you always had good jobs,

you were with Goldwater at the '64

convention, but you had marital

problems...

SONNY

Oh my God, mother!

VI

I said you were never a faggot.

SONNY

Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and

me are getting a jet, we're going to

Algeria - I'll write you from there.

VI

He was very understanding - you ought

to talk to him... Algeria?

SONNY

We can't stay here.

VI

Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If

you needed money, why couldn't you

come to me?  Everything I got is

yours.  I got two hundred and maybe

twenty-five in the savings.  It's

yours.  You know it.

SONNY

Mom - they're sending a bus to take

us to the airport.  You understand?

If you're here - they're not gonna

send it.  They'll think I'm gonna

come out with you.

VI

What's wrong with that?  The FBI was

very understanding when I explained

it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't

you... It's the pressures from your

home life.

SONNY

For God's sake don't start in on

Heidi again...

VI

Did I say a thing against her?  God

forbid I should say anything against

that fat cunt.

SONNY

Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a

mother shouldn't say in front of her

son.

VI

If she comes down here, so help me

I'm gonna mash her brains in.

Everything in your life was sunlight

and roses until you met her.  Since

then, forget it.

SONNY

She doesn't have anything to do with

it!  You understand that?  Mother?

This is me!

VI

I know you wouldn't need Leon if

Heidi was treating you right.  The

thing I don't understand is why you

come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?

You got two kids on welfare now.

What're you goin' to bed with her,

you don't have enough with one wife

and two kids on welfare, you want a

wife and three kids on welfare?

SONNY

(this is old stuff)

Not now, Mom, please.

VI

What'll you do?  Come out.

SONNY

(patiently - I told

you a hundred times)

I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal

will kill them.

VI

Oh.

(she thinks for a

moment)

Run.

SONNY

What the hell for?  Twenty-five years

in the pen?

VI

Maybe...

SONNY

Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you

live on!  Maybe what?

SONNY

I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There

isn't one single person in my life I

haven't hurt through my love.  You

understand that?  I'm the most

dangerous person in the world, because

if I love you, watch out, you're

gonna get fucked, fucked over and

fucked out!

VI

No!

SONNY

Did Pop come down?

VI

No.  This really pissed him off,

Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He

says he doesn't have a son.

SONNY

He's right.  You shoulda done what

he did.  Go home.

(embraces her)

Don't talk to the FBI anymore.

VI

I remember how beautiful you were.

As a baby you were so beautiful.  We

had such hopes.

SONNY

Mister Mulvaney?

MULVANEY

Yeah?

SONNY

Are you a lawyer?

MULVANEY

No.  I had some legal training, but...

SONNY

I want to dictate my will.  I need a

notary?

SYLVIA

I'm a notary.

SONNY

Being of sound mind and body, and

all that shit...

SONNY

To my darling wife Leon whom I love

as no other man has loved another

man in all eternity, I leave $2,700

from my $10,000 life insurance policy,

to be used for your sex change

operation.  If there is money left

over it is to go to you on the first

anniversary of my death, at my grave.

I expect you to be a real woman then,

and your life full of happiness and

joy.  To my sweet wife, Heidi, five

thousand from the same policy.  You

are the only woman I have ever loved,

and I re-pledge my love to you in

this sad moment, and to little Kimmy

and Jimmy.  I hope you remember me,

Jimmy.  You are the little man of

the family now, and will have to

look after them for me.  To my mother

I ask forgiveness.  You don't

understand the things I did and said,

but I'm me, and I'm different.  I

leave you, the rest of the policy

and my stamp collection.  I want a

military funeral and am entitled to

one free of charge.  Life and love

are not easy and we have to bend a

lot.  I hope you find the places and

the people to make you all happy as

I could not.  God bless you and watch

over you, as I shall, until we are

joined in the hereafter, sweet Leon,

my Heidi, dearest Kimmy and Jimmy,

and my mother.  Sonny... here I'll

spell the last name...

SONNY

Type that up and I'll sign it.

SONNY

Okay.  Get away from it.

SONNY

These seats come out?

DRIVER

Yeah.

DRIVER

(dawning on him)

Jesus, you're the man!

SONNY

Come on, what's under this?

DRIVER

I was lookin' at it.  I saw you,

man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!

You wouldn't believe it.

SONNY

Yes, I would.

DRIVER

God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna

believe it.  They just call in and

say gas up a stretchout and get it

down to

(address in Brooklyn)

and I say, 'shit, another load of

Okay.

SHELDON

What can he do, he's clean...

SONNY

Gimme the black guy...

DRIVER

Aw, hey...

SONNY

(overlapping everybody)

You men shoot, aim for the white

meat!

SONNY

What do you think you're dealing

SONNY

So long, copper.

SHELDON

Okay, Sonny?  You follow my car.

SONNY

Hey, let's get ready!

SYLVIA

SONNY

Okay, okay, okay!  What a bunch of

cold fish.  It's an adventure!

Everybody's gonna remember you the

rest of your lives, the day you got

MULVANEY

tie or?)

Okay, Sonny.

SONNY

All right.

(accepts receipt)

SYLVIA

Here's your document, Sonny.

SONNY

Yeah - it looks real official.

SONNY

Hold it for me?

SONNY

(letting Murphy out

first; yells outside)

Get away from the car!

SONNY

(to Sheldon)

Okay - you got your one.

SHELDON

(to Murphy)

You follow my car.

(he moves off)

SONNY

(elated)

Fuck!  We did it!

SYLVIA

(to Edna)

Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!

SONNY

I'll be a son of a bitch -- we're

all okay!  Hey, man!  Honk the horn.

Let's go!

MURPHY

Hey, Sal - do me a favor... point

that gun up, huh?  We hit a bump and

the fuckin' gun'll go off.

MURPHY

Sal - please keep that gun pointed

up, huh?

YOU ARE AN INSULT TO YOUR KIND

WE LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU SONNY!

SONNY

Murphy, can you see what they're

doing?

MURPHY

He's still got some arrangements to

make.

SONNY

There it is, Sal.  Sal?

SAL

I'm here.

SONNY

Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food?

I forgot to ask to have food on board.

SHELDON

That's the jet.  You give us one

more, now.  That's the deal...

SONNY

Okay.  Which one goes?

MULVANEY

Sylvia?

SYLVIA

It's Maria.  Go on, honey.

MARIA

I pray for your safety...

(meaning Sonny and

Sal)

...Sal?  Because I know it's your

first plane trip.  Don't be scared,

you know?

(gives him her rosary)

SONNY

I ain't eaten all day.  I just

realized it.

SHELDON

We'll have hamburgers on the plane.

You ready?

MURPHY

(turns to Sal again)

Sal, keep it up, huh?  The gun -

please...

SONNY

What do you think, Sal?  You ready

to go?

SAL

(gun pointing high)

Hey, Sonny - You did it!

SONNY

Let's move it, goddamn it.

SHELDON

(to Driver)

You ready to get out first?

DRIVER

Yes.

SYLVIA

(to Mulvaney)

I been dying to do this for years!

SHELDON (V.O.)

You are under arrest.  You have the

right to remain silent.  You have

the right to counsel to be present,

during your interrogation.

(etc.)

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

LEON

Well, I don't see how Sonny can

survive in prison, he was very loud,

very boisterous.  He was obnoxious.

LEON (V.O.)

He was very hard to live with...

HEIDI (V.O.)

He made me laugh.

PROUD YOUNG MAN

I love him.  He put an end to all

that pansy limp wristed shit!

HEIDI (V.O.)

Because he always had a way of getting

out, always in the army he was AWOL...

HEIDI (V.O.)

I can't help thinking how he might

ring the bell one of these days.

That's why I'm nervous, because I'm

always thinking some day he's gonna

come along and ring the bell...

FBI MAN

Keep your eyes front.

NEWSMAN

How did you know your son was

involved?

PAULINE

It was on the TV.

NEWSMAN

When was the last time you saw Sal?

PAULINE

Oh, a long time.  Because I kept

asking my husband where the heck

could Junior be?  He wasn't around

here.  I thought maybe he was in

prison or some place.

NEWSMAN

Did you know he was a homosexual?

PAULINE

No, not until after they killed him.

NEWSMAN

Did you always call him Junior.

PAULINE

Yeah.

NEWSMAN

Do you remember anything else about

Sal?

PAULINE

No, that's all.

SONNY

Hey!

SONNY

Goodbye!  You were terrific!  Mouth!

You're beautiful!  See you!

SYLVIA

Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?

MULVANEY

You were terrific, too!

SYLVIA

Hey.  It's raining.

LEON

I'm glad.  Life is easier with him

in prison.

HEIDI

It would be like always, the bell

would ring, we'd have a ball.

SONNY IS SERVING TWENTY-FIVE YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISON.

LEON IS NOW A WOMAN NAMED LANA.

HEIDI LIVES WITH HER CHILDREN ON WELFARE.

FADE OUT.

THE END
