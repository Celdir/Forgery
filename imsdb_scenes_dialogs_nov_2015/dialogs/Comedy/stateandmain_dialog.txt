State and Main

MORRIS

You hear that?

SPUD

Yes, I hear it.

MORRIS

Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half

an-hour, get across the street

yesterday.

SPUD

I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank

of the building.  Said, "What are you

doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the

'leven o'clock crossing..."

MORRIS

Y'wanna fix something, you should fix

the pothole.  Yessir, they should be

trussed up, thrown off some high

building.

DOUG

Who's that?

MORRIS

Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand

dollars, a new traffic light, you could

grow old, paint your house before it

lets you cross the street, and then, not

fix the pothole.

SPUD

What was wrong with the old traffic

light?

DOUG

I'm glad you asked... I'll tell you what

was wrong with it.  And what was wrong

with it was it was behind the times.

Now: You want to bring business into

this town?  You have to plan for a

Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at

the moment, no...

ANN

Morning, darling.

DOUG

Morning.

CARLA

Hi, Annie.

ANN

Morning, Carla.

MORRIS

SPUD

No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a

lot of people are pretty upset...

DOUG

They are, yes.  I'm sure they are...

WOMAN AT COUNTER

the rehearsal, tonight.

ANN

S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?

DOUG

MAUDE

come in...

ANN

We'll work it out.

JACK

What're they talking about?

ANN

Traffic light.

JACK

Waal, no, th'traffic light's Doug's

thing.  That's his thing, fine.

DOUG

Thank you, Jack, and...

JACK

But we got to talk about the pothole.

DOUG

Jack...

JACK

A public office is a public trust...

This is why this is America.  Question

is: who owns the street.

TOWNSMAN

Doc, those pills, y'gave me for my back?

I'm not sure that they work.

DOC WILSON

Well, I'm not sure either, but y'don't

hear me complain... come by th'office,

end of th'afternoon.

TOWNSMAN

Thanks, Doc...

BILL

This is your movie, this is small town

America.

WALT

Town in New Hampshire was small town

America, too.  Forty thousand dollars a

day, to shoot on the street.  And then

they kicked us out...

BILL

A jacket for five dollars... I can buy

this town for fifty bucks.

WALT

You told me that about the last town.

BILL

Yeah, but they never made a movie here.

Then I can't do this shot... you wants

me to push in -- I can't push in through

the window... we go back to New

Hampshire?

BILL

NO, we can't ever go back to New

Hampshire.

WALT

movie in this town.

WALT

Why would they be illegal?

MAYOR

Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to

say that anything I could do...

WALT

That's very kind of...as a matter-of

fact, one, I hate to bother you with...

JOE

Uh -- why did we have to leave New

Hampshire?

WALT

Halo?  Marty?

ANN

DOUG

Annie:  you stick to the Amateur

thing, you see?  This is Big Business,

in which, our Life

Water or mineral deposits.

DOUG

Waal, that's what I'm saying.

JACK

Communist Country, he hears that Calf

CARLA

I think that they're nice.

ANN

I'm sure they are.

JACK

That's the difference, Communism and you

know...

SPUD

Communism's over.

JACK

That's what they said about Warner

Brothers, 1985, but if you look at their

price-per-share...

CARLA

Dad, I've got to go to Terry's house to

study tonight...

JACK

I want you home by Nine.

DOUG

I want to tell you something, Ann: you

stay soft all your life, people despise

you;

it awakens Avarice in them, they take

advantage of you, and that's Human

Nature.

DOUG (CONT'D)

ANN

DOUG

JOE

ANN

JOE

The people in New Hampshire.

ANN

That's why they have state borders...

whyn't you get a replacement?

JOE

Well, it had sentimental value.

ANN

You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all

spruced up, good as new.  Better than

new.  It has some history.

JOE

Other one has history, too.  I wrote my

play on it.

ANN

You wrote a play on it?  What play is

that?

JOE

You haven't heard of it.

ANN

What's it called?

JOE

"Anguish."

MAUDE

You're writing a movie...

JOE

Yes.

MAUDE

What's it about?

JOE

It's about the quest for purity.

BOB

reads)

"Sister, I've just come from a fire.

There's some things I want to think

out..." now, come one, come on... "Leave

me alone."  a gesture...?  Alright?

WALT

What else?

BOB

BOB

Do you mind if we don't go through the

usual bullshit about how I loved it?

BOB (CONT'D)

I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion

Picture.

WALT

Thanks, honey, but next time, bring two,

save yourself a trip.

BOB

The people came to see a motion Picture.

Hold on...

WALT

He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?

BOB

WALT

Tell it with pictures.

She's a...?

WALT

She's a...

BOB

She's a waitress.

WALT

BOB

What I...

WALT

Hold on.  What Bob is saying, you don't

BOB

You don't need, "Hi, I've just come from

the restaurant."

WALT

(to Carla)

You can go...

BOB

Alright: Let's

(he takes out a list, Carla

exits)

Page five, the fucking horse dies.

(of Carla)

You know, she could be in the movie, she

could, she's got a good face, she could

be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have

to be his, uh, wife...?  It could be

his...

WALT

Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will

you?

BOB

No, you're absolutely...

WALT

And you go start with that stuff in this

BOB

Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look

CLAIRE

WALT

Claire, Bob Bar...

BOB

I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...

CLAIRE

WALT

We're just talking about the...

CLAIRE

Don't let me dis...I'll just...

WALT

No, no...please...

BOB

I'm looking at Page Five: "It's..."

JOE

"It's a nice evening..."

WALT

This is Joe White.

CLAIRE

How can I thank you?  How can I repay

you for this part?  It's a... what a,

thank you for this part.  The first

scene at the Old Mill...

WALT

Joe's been having some thoughts about

the Old Mill Scene, Claire.

CLAIRE

What, what's there to think about?

(pause)

The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...

WALT

Yes, but, Joe, Joe's been, well, he's

just been having a few, uh, "thoughts,"

about...

CLAIRE

How many times in your life do you get a

speech like that?

WALT

Yeah.

CLAIRE

This scene is why I'm doing the movie.

"Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the

way it goes around...half of the time

the darned wheel's under water, but..."

WALT

Yes, yes, but...

CLAIRE

"...but still it rises up.  It rises up,

Frank, high as it can go."

WALT

Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire

the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...

ANN

(of typewriter)

All ready to go?

JOE

So young, so unlined, so full of

promise.

(pause)

So innocent.

ANN

I beg your pardon?

JOE

I quit.

ANN

You quit.

JOE

I quit the movie.

ANN

Why did you quit?

JOE

Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I

think that I got fired.  I'm such a

liar.  I never could tell the truth.

ANN

Don't be so hard on yourself.

JOE

I just got kicked off my first movie.

ANN

Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you

were never down how would you know when

you were up?

JOE

That's good.  That's really good.  You

have a gift for words.

ANN

It's in your play.

JOE

You like my play.

ANN

Yes.

JOE

Why?

ANN

It's about life.

JOE

Could you tell me when's the next train?

ANN

N'about ten minutes.  What was your

movie about?

ANN (CONT'D)

(off his pause)

No, of course, you don't want to talk

about it.

JOE

(hands her the script)

It's about a man who gets a second

chance.

CAL

Evening, Annie.

ANN

Evening, Cal.

(to Joe)

Would you tell me about it?

JOE

I...

ANN

No, of course, you want to get out of

town.

JOE

It's...

ANN

It's okay...

OWNER

Evening, Annie.  See you at rehearsal.

ANN

You know your line?

OWNER

"Rise, one need not bend the knee before

the throne of justice."

ANN

Go you Huskies.

JOE

(of the clothing on the rack)

They leave it out all night?

ANN

Not worth stealing.  Only thing in town

worth something.  Stained glass window.

JOE

Ever wonder why the dalmation's the

symbol of the firehouse?

ANN

First organized fire department was on

the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in

the year 642.

JOE

But why the dalmation?

ANN

It was either that, or a sardine.

ANN (CONT'D)

You get what you pay for.

JOE

That's true.  You grow up here?

ANN

Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou

Theatre.

JOE

Nice town.

ANN

You want to talk about it?

JOE

...that...that he prayed for a second

chance.  But...do you see?

ANN

Yes.

JOE

That, he says, there are no second

chances...that he's been presented what

he prayed for...and: he's ruined it.

ANN

Yes...

JOE

But, but but but...

ANN

No, no, I see...

JOE

That: in an act of...

ANN

Yes...

JOE

Of mercy...off...

ANN

I understand...

JOE

...that...he sees that...

ANN

As the Old Mill goes around...

JOE

Of course, of course that's what I'm

saying.  As the Old Mill goes around, he

sees...

ANN

Of course.

JOE

...that it has been vouchsafed to him.

ANN

That's that's that's that's beautiful.

JOE

And you're the only one who'll ever hear

that speech.  Just you.

ANN

Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.

JOE

And likewise.

ANN

Goodbye.

JOE

Goodbye.

ANN

(pause)

Next train in'nt for two hours.

ANN (CONT'D)

So that the Old Mill, the Old Mill

represents...the wheel of fate is that

too...

JOE

No, no.  Of course, that's exactly what

it represents.

ANN

That whole...

JOE

The, the, the, the sanctity of everyday

things...

ANN

Everyday things...yes.

JOE

For example, he's just come back from a

fire and he...um...

(he shakes his head)

That's a fine house.  You look at that,

and you know, there's nice people that

live there.

ANN

I live there.

JOE

Really.  With the porch swing and

everything...

ANN

Surest thing you know.

JOE

I don't mean to impose, but...do you

think we might...

ANN

That's what the swing is there fore...

JOE

(to himself)

...that's what the swing is there

fore...that its purpose, isn't it...

ANN

...I always thought so...

JOE

...such a pleasant sound.

ANN

Mmm.

JOE

Cause, cause, it's...it's the simple

things that...

ANN

Yes...

JOE

...that.

DOUG

Waal, there you are, and Have I Got Some

News for you...

ANN

Doug, this is Joe White, and this is,

this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...

JOE

Sa pleasure.

DOUG

Guess who is THIS CLOSE to a nomination

to State Senate...which is this close to

one stop from Congress!

ANN

...who...?

JOE

Well, I guess I'll...get down to the

station.  It was lovely meeting...

ANN

Mister White is...

DOUG

Nice meeting you...they were, let me

tell you, they were a bit coy at first,

I told them: Look: the people are tired,

they're going to vote their pocketbook,

yes, but...

JOE

What happened in 1973?

WALT

Don't run off.  Don't run off, we need

you.  You know why?  You're why we're

here.  Your script is why we're here...

(of bag)

Gimme that.  Big deal.  We fight a

little bit?

You show me a family that doesn't.  But

we got something special.  What is it?

We're here to make a movie.  Can't use

the Old Mill.  Well, that happens.  What

you got to do, you find the essence -

what was it, that brought us here.  It

wasn't a building, Joe, it was an idea.

It was an essence - what is the essence

of your story?  Joe?

JOE

It's about a man who gets a second

chance.

WALT

Then, you write that.  And then this is

our second chance.  That's why we're

here.

JOE

I want to make a good film.

WALT

I know you do.

JOE

And maybe it will be a better movie

without the old mill, I...

WALT

Hey, it's with the G-ds.  We don't have

the money, we have to write it out.  The

best or not.

(shrugs)

And that's a lesson.  You get your

typewriter yet?

JOE

Um, no.

WALT

(into phone)

Grace, get on the other phone.  Call

that girl: well, call her, and have

whatsername send up some nosh...what do

you like to drink...?

JOE

I don't drink.

WALT

Did my matzohs come?  Get some for

everybody.

(into phone)

Thank you.

(hangs up)

Lemme tell you about my first movie...

DOUG

What, what what are you doing here?

ANN

Yes, that's right.

DOUG

Look at this.  Do you know what they're

offering?  Look at this.  They treat us

like we're their backyard.  Do you know

what they're offering for three days to

close down Main Street?

ANN

What are they offering?

DOUG

Ten thousand dollars.

ANN

That's so beautiful...

DOUG

I beg your pardon?

ANN

"The mill grinds the grain, but the

grain is not destroyed.  Although it is

altered..."

DOUG

Sure, but... ten thousand dollars.  Do

you know what they... this movie is

budgeted at fifty million dol...they're

coming up here, offer us a meal...

SHERRY (MAYOR'S WIFE)

The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...

MAYOR

...not the Lazyboy...

CAL

Hi, Sherry...

SHERRY

...put it in the living room.  And we

have thirteen at the table.

MAYOR

...we don't have thirteen at table...

SHERRY

Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the

director...

MAYOR

Waal, then, invite someone else, then...

SHERRY

I don't want to invite someone else

because this is the most exclusive...

MAYOR

Waal, then, you know, you do whatever

would make you happy.  Sher.  This is

your party, and whatever...

CAL

Hi Doug.

DOUG

Cal.  I want a city council meeting.

MAYOR

...little woman has gone crazy about our

dinner party... City Council?  What's

the trouble?

DOUG

Main Street.

MAYOR

(sighs)

Doug, the traffic light...

DOUG

Fuck the traffic light.  I'm talking

about three percent of the adjusted

gross of a Major Motion Picture.

JOE

Hi.

ANN

(simultaneously)

What are you doing?

(pause)

I love your script.

JOE

(simultaneously)

They decided, I decided to, to...you

love what?

ANN

You're still here.

JOE

I...I decided to give it another ch...

ANN

I love your script.

JOE

What?

POSTMAN

(as he delivers mail to Ann)

Mornin', Annie...

ANN

See you at rehearsal tonight?

POSTMAN

"In the name of justice, sir, I bid you

pause; for she is our Queen..."

JOE

In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure

if I'm giving them a second chance, or

they're giving it to me.  That's the

truth.  The truth's best, don't you

think?

ANN

You'd know better'n me.

JOE

How can you say that?

ANN

It's in your script...it's about getting

a second chance.  Innit?  "You can go

back..."

JOE

I can?

ANN

You bet your life.

(refers to script)

"The mill wheel goes around...some times

it's even under water -- then it rises

up, as high as it can go..."

JOE

But how do I...how do I do a film called

"The Old Mill" when I don't have an old

mill?

ANN

Well, first, you got to change the

title.

WALT

(to A.D.)

No, he doesn't want to work out with

Waterford Huskies...Because he's Bob

Barrenger...Call up his girl in Aspen,

have 'em ship his weight...Yeah, well,

fine, he's not gonna do the Pond scene

unless he can work out.  Call up his

girl in Aspen, and have her ship the

weights out...

WALT (CONT'D)

Who designed these costumes?  Who

designed these costumes?  It looks like

Edith Head puked and that puke designed

these costumes.  Get Madge.

SECRETARY

(to A.D.)

Your wife is on the phone.

WALT

I have no wife.

WALT (CONT'D)

(calling out)

We need a new name for the movie.

Where's the writer?

UBERTO

(entering with storyboards)

Wally, I got to takes out the window

from the dog.  I can't shoot through...

COSTUME DESIGNER

...Claire's got a problem.

UBERTO

Wally, if I hafes a moment of your time,

look at these storyboards.  THIS SHOOT,

I can't shoot this shot, you want.

WALT

Why?

UBERTO

Because they gots a window with a dogs

in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or

can I lose the shot.

WALT

No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning

of the film is in that shot.

UBERTO

But, Wally, the window of the firehut...

WALT

I don't care.  Fix it.

WALT (CONT'D)

(of sketches)

You show Claire these sketches?

COSTUME DESIGNER

Yes.

WALT

Did she throw up?

COSTUME DESIGNER

That isn't very nice.

WALT

Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in

the World Court.  Did she like the

costumes?

COSTUME DESIGNER

I can't tell.

WALT

Why not?

COSTUME DESIGNER

She won't stop crying...

WALT

(to an A.D.)

Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving,

get him a bunch of Lilacs to send to the

broad.

FIRST A.D.

Towns out of Lilacs.

WALT

You go in her room, take the Lilacs from

the water, dry them.  Go buy some

cellophane, wrap 'em up, and get a card

from Marty.

(to costume designer)

What's her problem?

COSTUME DESIGNER

She doesn't want to bare her breasts.

WALT

She doesn't want to bare her

breasts...what, in the "nude scene?"

What are we paying her three mil for?

COSTUME DESIGNER

She's got "religion."

WALT

Her religion bars her from fulfilling

her contr...

WALT (CONT'D)

Claire?...Claire?

(to Uberto)

Just figure out how to take the shot.

Claire...Claire?  It's Wally.

(pause)

May I come in?

WALT

(softly)

What is it, Pal...?

WALT (CONT'D)

What...?

CLAIRE

I can't do it, Walt.

WALT

You can't do what?

CLAIRE

It isn't right.  I can't...I...I know I

si...I, they, I don't know if they told

me it was in the con...

WALT

Forget the contract.  Claire.  What is

it?

CLAIRE

I don't want to take my shirt off in

that con...what are these things that

they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...

wha... I try to be good.  The only thing

I care about is...

WALT

I know that...

CLAIRE

Is...is the MOVIE!

WALT

I know that, Claire.  I, we all know...

CLAIRE

Everybody, they, they, they treat me

like a...

WALT

...no, they don't.

CLAIRE

...they treat me like a child.  I,

I...to bare my body.

WALT

Now, look.  Claire: Listen to me.

(he takes her hand in his)

I want to tell you a story.

WALT (CONT'D)

Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about

flowers, we're talking about a human

being.

CLAIRE

I...I...

WALT

Who are these from?

PROD. ASST.

Marty.

WALT

Well that's very thoughtful of him.

Elanora Duse...

CLAIRE

...I can't do it, Wally...

WALT

Listen to me.  Elanora Duse was playing

Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty

could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm

not doing the seven shows a week I

signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare

my soul seven times a week.  I am an

artist.  I'll do four shows a week."

(pause)

The greatest actress of her time.  You

know what her Producer said?

CLAIRE

(pause; softly)

What?

WALT

Nothing.  He held her and he wept.

Because he...

CLAIRE

...I...

WALT

Because he understood.  That was her

life's blood on the stage.

WALT (CONT'D)

...I know...I know...

CLAIRE

(pause)

...and, and, and did she?  And she did

the seven shows?

WALT

No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you

should do the scene.

CLAIRE

Wally...

WALT

I know, I know.

WALT (CONT'D)

I know, it's the hardest thing in the

world.  And it seems everybody wants...

CLAIRE

Yes...

WALT

...wants a piece...

CLAIRE

Yes...

WALT

And you know what?

CLAIRE

We, we have to give it.

WALT

(nods)

...and my heart goes out to you, because

I know...

WALT

That, that's your life's blood on the

st...

FIRST A.D.

I don't know what she's bitching about,

she's flashed her tits in the last five

movies, she'd bare her breasts to do

voice over.

FIRST A.D. (CONT'D)

I...

WALT

Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York,

tell him she's breaking her contract and

we're very up...

FIRST A.D.

I...

WALT

We're very upset with her.  Get someone

to double for her, her tits, the tits

scene.  Call L.A.  I want to see some

pictures of the women's tits.  Of their

tits.

FIRST A.D.

I'm very sorry I...

WALT

You're very sorry, you passive

aggressive, son-of-a-bitch!  Can we

replace him?

BILL

We start shooting in three days.

COSTUME DESIGNER

You want to see the fireman's costumes?

Cause I found this Moleskin for the

collar, it's not black, but it looks

black...  it's not brown, but...

SECRETARY

Marty Rossen's touched down.

JOE

(beat)

What I need to say...

ANN

Yes...

JOE

About conflict...

ANN

That's why you didn't want to take the

Mill out...you've...

JOE

ANN

JOE

How...?

ANN

Wait wait wait wait wait he get's a

second chance, do you see?  And you get

a second chance!

JOE

No, I don't...

ANN

(as she holds the script)

He doesn't go back to the mill, he gets

a second chance to go back to the

firehouse...

ANN (CONT'D)

You don't need the Mill.  This is what

(she gestures at the script)

you see: this is what you are.  This is

what the script is saying...

(a person walks by)

Hi, Emma, see you tonight?

ANN (CONT'D)

This is, look:

(to Emma)

Go you Huskies.

(to Joe)

...what I see you saying, is: you have

the two elements, Fire and Water.  The

Firehouse, and the Old Mill...do you

know, you could...

JOE

What are you doing tonight?

ANN

Me?

JOE

Yes.

ANN

Tonight, tonight, I...I have play

practice...

JOE

important.

WALT

Marteleh, vos macht a yid...?

MARTY

WALT

MARTY

That's thoughtful.

(of the bread)

Ziz good, you try this?

WALT

Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat

carbohydrates.

MARTY

What'd you do, build this...?

WALT

over sheep...

WALT

Did you bring Bob's weights

MARTY

They're coming Fed Ex.

WALT

(of the bags)

What's in all the bags?

MARTY

My undies, cause, you can't get this

picture off on time I'm gonna wet

myself.

WALT

I'm gonna bring it off.

MARTY

55 days and I take home the camera.  I

got an idea for a product placement...

DOC WILSON

Hiya Sally...

GIRL ON A SCOOTER

Hiya Doc...

DOC WILSON

GIRL ON A SCOOTER

DOC WILSON

MARTY

WALT

That's what I said.

MARTY

How are you getting on with these fine

people?

WALT

Like dykes and dogs.

BOB

Yeah.  Come in.

BOB (CONT'D)

I'm just...

CARLA

The prices are going up.

BOB

But, that's the way of the world, huh?

Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the

world.

BOB (CONT'D)

Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you

like some?

CARLA

I don't eat vegetables.

BOB

Well, I can offer you something to

drink?

CARLA

Sure, what have you got?

BOB

What do you drink?

CARLA

Bourbon and milk.

BOB

How old are you?

BOB (CONT'D)

Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone I

gave you this.

CARLA

I wouldn't tell anyone anything that

happened between me and somebody who was

my friend.

BOB

Nice town that you've got here.

CARLA

You want to see it better, we could go

out on the roof.

BOB

...wouldn't that be dangerous?

CARLA

...not if you've got something to hold

on to.

UBERTO

Because if you cannot tells me what is

it, how I, how does I take a pictures of

it?  Wally wants me, push in through the

weendow...

JOE

Yeah, no, can I...if you'd excuse me,

I've just got to...

ANN

Heart."

JOE

Well, then, it don't look good for the

JOE

ANN

ANN (CONT'D)

Hi!

I've been thinking.

DOUG

Where have you been, we had a date for

DOUG

Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's

ANN

It's all over between us, Doug, I'm

sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found

someone else, and, it's very serious and

it's the end.  I'm sorry.

(pause)

It isn't you, j...

DOUG

Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call

The other side.

Shouldn't we start?

JOE

Start?  This isn't a good time.

better time.

JOE

Later on.

ANN

Then I'll come back, then.

JOE

You, um, you, um, you going out with

No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see

It occurred to me, you'd wanna have

JOE

She came in here, wait, she...I was

clothes, and she got in bed, I told her

I could not -- we don't know each other,

you see...

CLAIRE

We had a script conference.

JOE

I told her thank you very much, but it

was inconvenient because, uh, because...

ANN

You can do it.

JOE

Because I'd met someone else.

ANN

(very simply)

Oh, okay.

JOE

You believe that?

ANN

I do if you do.

JOE

But it's absurd.

ANN

So is our electoral process.  But we

still vote.

JOE

Do you truly believe the electoral

process is absurd?

ANN

I used to go out with a politician.

JOE

You used to go out with him, you broke

up with him?

ANN

Sure did.

JOE

Why?

ANN

Time for a change.  Keep your margins

straight.

JOE

Yes.

ANN

Go you Huskies!

MAYOR

And don't you worry about that permit...

MARTY

Why, that's right fine...

POSTMAN

Mornin' George.

MAYOR

Hey, Chunky.

(to Marty)

Well, we're glad to have you here.  My

wife, Sherry, SHER, YOUR BROTHER'S HERE.

(to Marty)

We're having a party, matofact, Tuesday

night, for Walt and Bob Barrenger...

MARTY

Mmm....

MAYOR

Havin' 'em over, home-cooked meal, if

you'd...

MAYOR (CONT'D)

Well, I'd be awfully...

SHERRY

Where the hell have you been?  It's...

MAYOR

Sherry, this...

POSTMAN

(come back out of house with

cup of coffee)

Mornin' Sherry.

SHERRY

It's a quarter after nine, I've been on

the phone to...

PAINTER

Morning, Mrs. Baily, Mista Bailey...

SHERRY

I've got two days to get this house...

MAYOR

Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the

producer.

SHERRY

I am so glad to meet you.  We are so

glad to have you here, and welcome you

to our...I, you know, they had c... I'm,

yearly I redecorate our, to restore it

to the, 1835...

MARTY

What is that?

SHERRY

The house, the 1835.  The original

kitchen, of course, burned in 1960, as

part of a spate of fires...

MARTY

It's lovely.

SHERRY

A spate of suspicious fires which were

in fact the inspiration for the

formation of the Waterford Huskies.

MARTY

My oh my.

SHERRY

I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an

informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be

'on set,' but if you'd like to join

your...

DOUG

I have to talk to you.

MAYOR

Doug, this is Mr...

SHERRY

Oh, how thoughtless of me.  Would you

like a cup of tea...

MAYOR

...he's the producer of the movie.

DOUG

(to Marty)

I want you to hear this, pal...

(consults notebook)

Forget the overages, forget Ten Thousand

Dollars, for three days to two weeks.

You know what it would cost for them to

build this set?

(pause)

Two Million Dollars!  Now:

MAYOR

Doug...

DOUG

Now:  The Waterford Merchant's

Association, of who I am Council...

SHERRY

Don't tell me you're out of Wallpaper.

PAINTER

I told you, we could have it by

Wednesday...

SHERRY

Wednesday, don't tell me Wednesday, the

biggest grossing box office star in the

world is coming for dinner Tuesday...

PAINTER

Waal, if you ordered something common...

SHERRY

Something common?  I'm going to give you

something common.  I'm going to give you

an injunction, is what I...Mister Mayor.

DOUG

Huh.  Well, the Waterford Merchant's

Association demands, through me as their

council, five percent of the profits of

the movie, as figured by and...

(checks his notebook)

geared to the most favorable definition

of profits of either A) the Producer...

DOUG (CONT'D)

Why, you little sheeny...

MORRIS

"Assembly of Death" did 95 million

dollars the first weekend.

SPUD

Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.

MORRIS

You think so?

SPUD

Waal, what was the per-screen

average...?

JOE

Cuppa coffee, and a...

JACK

With you inna moment.  I'm a little

short-handed.

MORRIS

Where's Carla?

SPUD

Hiya, Annie...

MORRIS

Annie, sorry I ain't been to a meetin'

of the Drama Club...

MORRIS (CONT'D)

Oh, good...

ANN

Good morning to you...whatsa matter?

JOE

I can't get it to come out right.

ANN

What's the scene...

JOE

It used to be the Old Mill.

ANN

What've you got?

JOE

They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has

just died.  He's coming from the fire.

JACK (O.S.)

Annie, you want something to eat?

ANN

What's the scene about...?

JOE

It's good to see you, too...

JACK

Annie?

ANN

What about...what about...it's so

presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling

you how to wr...

JOE

Please...

ANN

How about, he sees her on the street, he

wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes

up to her.  "What happened to the

horse?"  She looks at him.  She takes

his hand...

JOE

Ah, ah, ah...

ANN

I hurt you?

MORRIS

What happened to his finger?

ANN

It was burnt.

MORRIS

Mmm.

ANN

And then it was really hurt.

JOE

Ah, ah, ah.  That's what she says,

that's what she says.  He says, "Sister,

I've come from a fire..."  But she, but

she, she says it was not the fire which

hurt you...it...

MORRIS

...how was it hurt?

ANN

...he stuck a fishhook in it.

(Morris nods)

JOE

She realizes -- it was not the fire

which hurt him...that the true hurt was

her.  Was her...

ANN

...yes.

JOE

...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...

ANN

...yes.

JOE

Has been wounded by her heat...by her

infidelities...

JACK

Anybody here seen Carla?

JOE

Because, because, because if it's about

purity, it's...it's...and then, then,

you don't need the nude scene.

ANN

Because it's about purity...

JOE

That's...that's exactly what it's about.

Take...

ANN

That's right...

JOE

...take any two people...

JACK

...anybody seen my daughter...?

JOE

...take you and me...

WALT

(on phone)

...the finest people you could ever hope

to work with...

(to First A.D.)

You have the new Old Mill pages?

FIRST A.D.

I can't find the writer.

WALT

(on phone)

...totally false...totally false.  He is

the, I would say the most responsible

human being I have ever...

FIRST A.D.

I have to talk to you.  My wife...

WALT

Not now.

FIRST A.D.

My wife is going to have a baby, and...

WALT

Oh, that's great.  Let's bring more

people into this overcrowded world.

WALT (CONT'D)

Take it off.  Take that stupid fucking

shirt off right now.

(into phone)

Well, if I had to say one thing, I would

say it's purity.

WALT (CONT'D)

(to P.A.)

Not now, I'm talking to the press.

Claire!

CLAIRE

What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to

catch.

WALT

I, uh...

(into phone)

I've always thought so...

(beat)

Well, you just get an idea, and try to

find the best way to express it in

pictorial form.

(to Claire)

I've written a letter to the studio and

to SAG protesting...

(opens door)

Bill: get a copy of that letter...!

(closes door)

I just wanted to tell you that I am past

chagrined, I'm mortified at the way you

were spoken to...

CLAIRE

I...

WALT

An artist of your caliber...

CLAIRE

I'm only trying to...

WALT

I know what you are, I am so sorry that

you...when I read that script I said

there's only one person to play that

part.

CLAIRE

The minute I read that script I said...

WALT

I know...

CLAIRE

...she works with animals, she...

WALT

...yes...

CLAIRE

...she has a home...

WALT

...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes,

a woman who...the...the community

respects her.

(beat)

Please don't go.

(pause)

Please don't go.  What can I do but

beseech you...?  Trauma, toil...when are

we free of them...?

(pause)

When...?

CLAIRE

He treated me as if I were a child...

WALT

Claire:

(pause)

As an interpretive artist to a creative

artist:

(pause)

Stay with me.

(pause)

I need you.

(pause)

We start to shoot tomorrow and then it

belongs to us.  Stay.

(pause)

Stay.  Tonight...when...

(gestures outside)

When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's

really talk.  We could, we'll have

dinner, we'll...a bottle of some bad red

wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...

CLAIRE

I'm sorry, Walt -- it's gone beyond

that.

WALT

(into phone)

Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any...

any...any time...

(hangs up the phone)

What does the woman want from life?

MARTY

She wants eight-hundred thousand dollars

to show her tits.

WALT

Pay her off.

MARTY

We don't have the money.

WALT

Find it.

MARTY

If you do the product placement...

WALT

It's a computer company...IT'S A

COMPUTER COMPANY - BAZOOMER-COM?!

MARTY

"Bazoomer dot com."

WALT

I can't put a computer in a movie shot

in 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm

gonna do that?

MARTY

Actually, the art department had some

ideas on...

WALT

NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU

HEAR ME?!

MARTY

(picks up the phone and dials)

Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I

neee... I NEED EIGHT-HUNDRED GRAND.

I...I don't care where it comes from.

(to Walt)

It comes out of our end.

(Walt gestures do it)

I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY.  I

JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:

JOE

She doesn't show her tits!!! She doesn't

show her tits.  The breasts symbolize

motherhood, the audience...

MARTY

The breasts symbolize motherhood...

JOE

The movie's about purity.  So we don't

show her breasts.  We show them to him.

She keeps her back to the camera.

WALT

...she keeps her back to the camera?

BILL

It'll hurt the box-office.

JOE

They know what her tits look like.

WALT

Know?  They could draw them from memory.

You're fantastic.  What a find you are.

Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse

scene.

JOE

I'm gonna nail it.

WALT

I know you are.  Go you Huskies.

MARTY

We got the permit.

WALT

Is that one hell of a kid?

MARTY

He just saved us eight-hundred thousand

bucks.

WALT

He's got a gift for fiction.

MARTY

We got to do something nice for him.

MARTY (CONT'D)

Gimme a pencil.  Get him a bottle

of...get him some maple syrup.  Stick

this card on it, and put it in his room.

PROD. ASST.

Maple syrup.

MARTY

Yeah.

MARTY (CONT'D)

(in b.g. as he takes back the

card)

Hold on, I wanna add to that.

SPUD

You see where Tom Miller's playin' the

Old Farmer?

MORRIS

He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on

sixty years.

SPUD

I read for that part.  Did pretty good,

too.

MORRIS

Bet you did.

SPUD

But I couldn't r'member all the words.

Ast them would they gimme a second

chance.

MORRIS

Ain't no second chances in life.

SPUD

MORRIS

Only second chance we git, z'ta make the

same mistake twice...

WALT

Bobby...

BOB

Everybody needs a hob...

FIRST A.D.

Walt, I wonder if I could take a minute

of your time.  I need a day off...

WALT

Who is it?

CAL

Thiz the police.  Is Mr. Barrenger in

MARTY

Okay, look, you, what is she, 19,

BOB

Uh, look...

MARTY

Look: okay.  Okay.  Look: look you're

WALT

No, hey, hey...al, she hid in the back

CAL

Is Mr. Barrenger there...?

MARTY

No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't

put her in the car, she gets it in her

head to sue, or rape, or some goddamn,

WALT

She wasn't in...you were al...

MARTY

There's no witnesses.

WALT

No, just the...there's no witnesses,

right...?

BOB

No, I just...just Joe, just Joe...

WALT

Joe, the writer?

BOB

Just him and me.

MARTY

Then she wasn't in the car.  Say it.

BOB

She wasn't in the...

MARTY

Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It

says here...

(to group)

Are we together on this?

(beat, each nods)

Because it's sink or swim here, pals...

MARTY (CONT'D)

(to First A.D. and Joe)

You guys had better leave us a...

CAL

Mr. Barrenger...

MARTY

Yes...?

CAL

I'm very sorry to...

MARTY

Well.  What seems to be the...?

CAL

I have to ask you these...um.  You have

a valid drivers' license?

MARTY

Of course he...

CAL

Could I see it, please...?

CAL (CONT'D)

Were you under the inf...

BOB

No.

CAL

And who was driving the...

BOB

I was alone in the car.  I was driving.

CAL

Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very

sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could

be, but...

MARTY

I'm an attorney, if there's anything you

have to say to...

CAL

...I have to give you this ticket for

damage to city property.  I'm really

sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope

you'll excuse...

MARTY

(beat)

You have to what?

CAL

It's a formality.  Any case of damage to

city prop...you hit the control box of

the new stop light, and...

(apologetically he hands the

ticket to Bob)

They'll, uh, these things happen, I hope

you're alright, and that you're

feeling...

MARTY

Well, officer, don't worry ab...

CAL

If there's anything I...

WALT

(into phone)

Yeah.  Hello, Mr. Mayor...Walt Price!

No, no, sir, he's fine.  Well, he's

right here!  Would you like to...?

(covering phone)

You are not to see that girl again...do

you...

CLAIRE

Hello.

WALT

(into phone)

...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...

CLAIRE

(to Bob)

Bob, are you alright?

JOE

Hi.

ANN

Hi.

JOE

Where you going?

ANN

Going home.

JOE

Going home, yeah.  I told them what you

said...

ANN

(over a clap of thunder)

What?

JOE

I told them what you said about the

script...

ANN

I didn't say anything special, I was

just talking out loud.

JOE

...how else can you talk?

ANN

No, that's true.

JOE

No.  You, I told them, you can't betray

with the picture what you're saying with

the words.  And, I don't know, the

movies, I don't know.  They should be

socially uplifting, why does she have to

show her br...what is this...?

ANN

Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop.

Vacant for thirty years.

JOE

Is it...

ANN

Yep, n'it's for sale.

(pause)

One of the few things money can buy.

JOE

I told them what you said about the

script...

ANN

Would you like to see it?  I've got the

key back at my store...

JOE

I'd love to.

ANN

How's your star?

JOE

Gosh, you look nice.

ANN

...what...?

JOE

What would you do with it, the

printshop...

ANN

Start back up the Waterford Sentinel.

Town newspaper.  Show you the plans.

JOE

Yes, it's a lovely idea...

ANN

Print it right here.

ANN (CONT'D)

Oh, my.

(pause)

Life in the country.  One second.

ANN (CONT'D)

Well.  There you go.

ANN (CONT'D)

Press still works.

JOE

It does?

ANN

Did as of last week.

ANN (CONT'D)

Best way I know to get ink on your

hands.

JOE

You'd do the newspaper right here.

ANN

That's something a man could do...?

JOE

You know what else a man can do?

ANN

What?

ANN (CONT'D)

One moment...

JOE

Pelting down out there.

ANN

People might be better off.  They

thought about it, spent the evening back

in the...

ANN

Left the keys inside, in my jacket.

JOE

Well.  'S'pose I should be getting

home...look.

ANN

Cal...

CAL

Annie, got an umbrella?

ANN

Nope.

CAL

I'll walk you home, you can have my

coat.

ANN

Then you'll be wet.

CAL

I'm goin' off-shift.  Come on... I'll

walk you home.

DOUG

Ten dollars apiece for outdated

textbooks you or I could buy retail for

a dollar ninety-five.

DOC WILSON

Mornin', Carla...how's the itching...?

CARLA

Okay, Doc.

DOUG

Bear with me, now -- because what're we

getting for our money?  See the cat and

dog?  See what I'm saying?  Nice to take

this opportunity to mount an

investigation of...

MAUDE

Morning, Carla, what happened to you?

DOC WILSON

She went to fetch a pail of water.

DOUG

(to merchant)

You see what I'm saying, take this

opportunity to mount an investigation of

the price of school textbooks.  Bear

with me now: both the cost, and the

content of...look here...

DOUG (CONT'D)

...because what're we getting for our

money?  "See the nice dog.  See the nice

cat?"

WALT

So you see what I'm saying...the movie

is about purity...

BOB

I've always seen that.

WALT

We don't show her breasts, we just show

your reaction...

CLAIRE

I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I

can't tell you...

WALT

Well, Joe said it, and he's right.

CARLA

And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...

MARTY

(hands her a bill)

Thank you.

CARLA

I, well, you know, I tried to take him,

in his room.

MARTY

I think he's moved...

CARLA

I, uh...

(pause)

Um...

BOB

That makes a lot of sense, Claire, that

makes a lot of...list...listen, cause

the audience isn't coming to see your

breasts.  They are coming to see you

act.  What are you doin' this evening?

CLAIRE

I'm having dinner with W...

WALT

We're going to discuss the scr...you

wanna come along...?

BOB

You mind...?

CLAIRE

No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.

WALT

Marty...

MARTY

Yeah?

WALT

Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D.,

someone, somewhere where we can get

away, something, I want, you know, last

day before the shooting, get away,

forget it, have some local food.

(to Joe)

You want...

JOE

I've got a date.

WALT

He's got a date.  He's got a date, is

this guy fantastic...?

Already he learned how to write a movie,

and he found a girl to get his toes

curled, what a guy, what a...what a

literary find!

FIRST A.D.

(on phone; sotto)

I'm trying, honey.  I'm...look, is your

Ma, when is your mom coming?  Oh.

(pause)

What did the midwife...?

WALT

Did you, where are we going tonight?

FIRST A.D.

I...?

WALT

Some, you were, you were going to make a

reservation for us?  Where's my

schedule?  Where are we booked tonight?

FIRST A.D.

My wife's having a baby.

WALT

You what...?  Is that on the call sheet,

is that on the callsheet, or is that

personal business?  Ah, Christ.

Marty...are we paying you?

FIRST A.D.

I...

DOUG

She didn't even finish knitting me the

sweater...

BARTENDER

Mornin', Doc...

DOC WILSON

You doin' here, Doug?  Thought you

started out the day with that pernicious

caffeine...

DOUG

Kiss my ass.

DOC WILSON

Well.

BARTENDER

He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him

for some guy on the movie.

DOC WILSON

Well, they don't always leave with the

ones they came in with.

BARTENDER

Big day last night.

DOC WILSON

Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the

fragments of glass out of Bob

Barrenger's actual head myself.

BARTENDER

Mornin', Carla.

CARLA

Mornin', Uncle Ron.

DOC WILSON

Cluster of events.  Don't see something,

ten years, allasudden, three times inna

night.

BARTENDER

That's what they call an events cluster.

Some guy orders a Manhattan, fifteen,

twenty years, allasudden, three times

inna night.

DOUG

Who got their heads cut?

BARTENDER

...some fella.  Orders a Manhattan.

DOC WILSON

What?

DOUG

Who got their heads cut?

DOC WILSON

Uh, Bob Barrenger, fella, Cameraman...

DOUG

You said three...

DOC WILSON

Did I?  I think you're mistaken.

CARLA

I wasn't in the car...

DOUG

We're going to s...

JACK

Doug, she says that she wasn't in the

c...

SALESMAN

Yeah?

DOUG

(beat)

I've got the wrong room.

DOUG (CONT'D)

(to Cal)

Arrest him.

MARTY

What is the...?

DOUG

Arrest him.

CAL

For what...?

DOUG

(beat)

Conspiracy in Statutory Rape.

MARTY

Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of

whom?

DOUG

This young woman.

CARLA

Nobody touched me, I was at home.

MARTY

(to Carla)

Who is it raped you?

CARLA

Nobody.

MARTY

Well, what's the beef?

DOUG

She was in the car with Bob Barrenger

last night.  And she was injured coming

home from a love tryst, so...

MARTY

You were in the car with Bob?

CARLA

No.

MARTY

Then what is the...?

MARTY

Now what is this, you sonofabitch!

Because if you haven't heard about the

laws of Malicious Prosecution, you're

about to.  DON'T FLINCH WHILE I'M

TALKING TO YOU, YOU TWO BIT SPEEDTRAP

FRAUD: There's an old saying, two

scariest things in the world, a black

man with a knife and a Jew with a

lawyer.  Now, I am a lawyer, and I am

the Jew, and you continue ONE MOMENT

with this slanderous shit here in this

public place, I'm going to have your ass

over my mantleplace.  THE KID WAS NOT IN

THE CAR, SHE SAYS THAT SHE WASN'T IN THE

CAR, NO ONE SAYS SHE WASN'T IN THE CAR,

NO ONE SAYS THAT SHE WAS IN THE CAR, YOU

HAVE NO CORPUS AND YOU HAVE NO CASE, AND

YOU KNOW IT.  SO I'M NOT PAYING PATSY

WITH YOU HERE, YOU MOTHERFUCKER.  Look

in my eyes: I made eleven million bucks

last year and I don't like being trifled

with.  Now I think that the better part

of valor, though we've got your back up

here...the better part of valor is to

step away.  Or, before G-d, I will see

you disbarred.

(beat)

Now, what do you think?

(beat)

We all have a movie to make.  Now, can

we stay together here...?

(pause)

What do you say?  Have a cigar.

MARTY

It's a mistake.  It's all over.

(to Carla)

I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.

CARLA

I wasn't in the car.

MARTY

We know that you weren't.

CLAIRE

...because you treat me like a

child...you treat me like a child...

that's why I can't come...

CARLA

He took advantage of me.

MARTY

...upset and impressionable.

(to the A.D.)

Get me the Mayor.

BOB

(to Carla)

...I was just talking to that girl in

the other room.

MARTY

...overcome by the events around her,

the presence of a high-powered...

BOB

(to Carla)

I never touched her.  My mother's gr...

MARTY

And a fantasy object...

DOUG

(to Cal)

Tell him to get dressed...

CAL

Uh, sir...

MARTY

(takes lawbooks)

Wally?

WALT

Look, Carla, this is a hard time for

you.  Many young people go to Hollywood.

I did...and we all dream of it, and

here, here Hollywood has come to you.

CAL

Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, but...

WALT

Here this dream world has come to you.

Now, you obviously have an active, a

vivid imagination.

CARLA

Her...

BOB

I swear that that woman in my room...

WALT

Be quiet, Bob.  A fertile mind.  Now we

can use that kind of people in our work.

Yes, we can.  Now, and this is what

occurs to me... There's a part in the

film...isn't that right, Marty?

MARTY

Mmm.

WALT

That we could use you in and I think

that's quite a fine trade-off all around

and an ill wind that blows somebody

good.

MARTY

(of the book)

Here it is: Statutory r...blah, blah,

blah, blah... "statutory"...

"unsupported testimony by the..."

(he shows the book to Doug)

Hold on, Bobby.

(to Doug)

You've got nothing and you know it.  By

G-d, you know it.  Harassment.  You need

a... even if this was true, you need a

witness.  You need someone puts her in

the car.  And you've got nothing.  Now

we all have...yes, give her that part in

the film.

(to Carla)

Yes, we'd love to have you... Now: we

all have more important things to do,

isn't that right...?

MARTY (CONT'D)

Isn't that right?  I'm sorry that you

all went to this...

JACK

I knew she wasn't in the car.

MARTY

This has been just an unfortunate.

WALT

(into phone)

Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just

an, an unfortunate...

(he covers the phone)

It's the Mayor, he's saying...

MARTY

Is he cool or angry?

MAYOR

Well, these things happen.  Purpose of

my call, my wife wanted to know what

brand of cigarettes Mr. Barrenger

smokes, so she could lay some out

tonight...we got the list of his dietary

requirements...

WALT

(hangs up phone)

So we just got lucky.

BILL

Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast.  He

needs your confirmation on a request for

money...?

MARTY

And I need a drink.

WALT

(to Bob)

If your memory was as long as your dick,

you'd be in good shape.  How long since

you almost went to jail for this shit?

BOB

How could she turn on me like that?  I

thought she liked me.

WALT

Can we try to keep our pants buttoned

and get out of this town in one piece?

BOB

I'm ready!

WALT

Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your

room.

BOB

What'll I do for fun?

MARTY

Whyn't you learn your lines?

BOB

I know my lines...

WALT

You do...?

BOB

I just don't know what order they come

in...

WALT

I tell you what, let's ditch these

cockamamie locals.  I need to get outta

here.  Go to some roadhouse tonight,

just us.  Claire, Bob, siddown, have a

bottle of wine.  Tell me where we're

going, and let's go.

MAYOR

Well, you must, where did they...

where...I...

DOUG

Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...

FIRST A.D.

My wife just went into labor...

DOUG

Half a buck I'd close it down.  It's

per...you know...it's perfidy, you got

your Barrenger, molesting little girls.

FIRST A.D.

He should be put in jail.

DOUG

Half a buck I'd put him in jail.

FIRST A.D.

You should.

DOUG

I had a witness, I would.

FIRST A.D.

A witness to what?

DOUG

You know, the rape, to...even to the

accident.

FIRST A.D.

You mean with White?

DOUG

What?

FIRST A.D.

You mean you need a witness in addition

to White?

DOUG

Who's White?

FIRST A.D.

The writer.

DOUG

(beat)

He saw the accident...?

FIRST A.D.

Sure.

DOUG

He saw the girl in the car...

FIRST A.D.

You bet he did.

SHERRY

Don't you touch that... I want them

gone.

MAYOR

I signed the permit.  I don't know how I

can.

SHERRY

I want them thrown in jail.

MAYOR

Sherry, Sherry...

MAYOR (CONT'D)

(into phone)

What?

(he jiggles the receiver)

Get me the State Police.

JOE

Good morning.

ANN

Sleep well?

JOE

Yeah, you?

ANN

Oh yeah...

JOE

We could live up here, live up in the

country.

ANN

Now you're talking...

JOE

And we could get up every morning...

ANN

...well, we do that anyway...

JOE

And come to the printshop.  You know

why?

JOE (CONT'D)

To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to

write.  To write.  To write.  Right here

in the office.

ANN

Not without a rolltop desk.

JOE

Well, I could get a rolltop desk.

ANN

Happen to know where there's one for

sale.

JOE

Well ain't you amazing.

ANN

Lookit that, up already.

JOE

That's why we filmfolk get along so well

with you farmers.  Both up with the

chickens.

TV REPORTER

Where Movie Star Bob Barrenger, fresh

from his troubles with the law last

year...

TV REPORTER (CONT'D)

...is once again in hot water.  Involved

in a car crash last night with a young,

a very young woman, Mr. Barrenger is

being arrested today for...

MARTY

You better make sure you got your facts

straight, pal, cause, you step off the

line and I'm going to sue you personally

for...

TROOPER

We're looking for a Joseph Turner White.

MARTY

Oh, good, yes.  Good morning.  Where are

you taking Mr. Barrenger?

TROOPER

We are looking for a Mr. Joseph Turner

White?

MARTY

What are you doing with Mr. Barrenger?

DOUG

He's under arrest.

MARTY

Oh, good.  I'm his lawyer...and you must

be Perry Mason.  Guess what, you're

about one-half step from a world of

hurt...how diverting...the Mayor's gonna

have your ass.  Can I watch?

DOUG

Well, you guess what.  The Mayor sent

me.  I have your Mr. Barrenger with a

history of...

MARTY

...a history of nothing, he was

acquitted.

DOUG

Moral turp...you're on my home court,

friend.  I have the Mayor and the town

behind me, and forget making your movie:

I may own the studio when I get through

with you: I got a civil suit, I got

rape, I got collusion...

MARTY

You've got nothing, you don't have a

witness...

DOUG

And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White

saw the crime.

MARTY

He told you that!?

DOUG

He didn't have to tell.

MARTY

I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...

DOUG

Oh, you're his attorney, too?

MARTY

Later for you, pal.

DOUG

Okay.

MARTY

Bobby, don't say anything.

BOB

Nothing happened.

DOUG

We'll see about that at the inquest.

MARTY

Yeah, hi, pal.  I need to talk to you.

ANN

What is it all about?

JOE

I saw...

MARTY

How do they know that, you told them?

JOE

No.

MARTY

What did you say to them?

JOE

I didn't say anything to them.

MARTY

How do you know you saw it?

JOE

I don't know.

MARTY

Well, then, you didn't see it, right?

JOE

I don't...

MARTY

You didn't see it...

JOE

I...?  I saw it.  I was there.

MARTY

You were there.  At...at 10:35...?

JOE

(as he reads)

I was walking down the street...I

remember, I was writing a...

MARTY

What glasses were you wearing?

(pause)

Were you wearing your reading glasses?

JOE

I...

MARTY

You told me you were writing.  Don't you

wear your reading glasses to write...?

MARTY (CONT'D)

I've got to go to the jail.

ANN

...he's going to give you a couple of

minutes.

JOE

What am I gonna do?

ANN

You got to tell 'em that you saw the

accident.  Don't you?

JOE

I can't do that.

(pause)

If I tell them, they'll, if I tell them,

they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...

it'll ruin his career...

ANN

But that's what happened.

JOE

But it'll stop the movie.

ANN

Maybe they'll be other movies.

JOE

They'll...they'll blackball me.

ANN

Carla was in the car, right?

JOE

I...I think that's right.

ANN

...you think that's right...

JOE

What'm I gonna do?

CAL

Lotta hubbub on the street.  I'm taking

you the back way.

WALT

(checks watch)

Let's speak English.  You've got to help

the side.

JOE

You want me to lie.

WALT

To the contrary.  I want you to tell the

truth.

(pause)

The truth is, you can't tell me, to a

certainty, that you saw the thing.  You

don't remember, a gun to your head,

which glasses you have on.  And you have

a fertile imagination.  Imagination

wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  IF

you aren't sure, then they have nothing.

Bob walks free.  As he should.

(pause)

Joe: wasn't long ago they buried actors

at the crossroads with a stake through

their heart, you know?  The people who

are talking to you about the way we live

though we may praise them, we fear them.

And they fear us.  Because we tell the

truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a

damn roost, and everyone knows it;

the guy is looking for a case, he wants

to make a name for himself...If we let

him do that, if we let him do that, then

we're being false to our community...to

our community, you understand?  To our

world.  Cause you are a part of that

world, now.  You have to take off the

steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.

(pause)

And be part of your world.  I got a five

picture deal with the studio.  And you

stick with me.  You write one, two more,

you stick with me, and you'll direct the

third one.  You are a part of this

world.  You have to do the right thing:

we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff,

literally is at our door.  You have to

stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the

bottom line.  You have to...if you had

the leisure to think it through, you'd

see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in

the car.

CAL

...Joseph Turner White...

BAILIFF

Hear ye, hear ye.  Sixth District Court.

And for the county of Kadona, State of

Vermont, the honorable James Addison

Flynn presiding.  All those having

business before this court, draw forward

and you will be heard.

BAILIFF (CONT'D)

All rise.

JUDGE

Please...Mr. White?  This is a simple

matter of...

JUDGE (CONT'D)

Uh huh, all we need's a simple fact or

to...you're going to give your

recollection of the accident last

evening, at the corner, State and Main.

Would you please swear him in.

BAILIFF

Do you swear to tell the truth...

TV REPORTER

(talking into camera)

...the arraignment, as we said of Bob

Barrenger, The Bob Barrenger, star of

"The Old Mill," about to begin shooting

here, in picaresque and sleepy...

(sound of shouting, and

reporter looks around)

we should say, formerly sleepy...Yes,

yes, it's...yes, it's Claire Wellesley,

and we're going to try to get a look

at...

P.A.

(to Joe)

They need those rewrites on the "Old

Mill" scene...

SCOTT

...about his personal life, though I can

tell you a few things about...

JOE

Would you please hold all calls to my

room?

SCOTT

Though I can tell you a few things about

his dietary requirements.

KID ON SCOOTER

Mornin', Doc.

DOC WILSON

Mornin', Billy, where ya goin' in such a

hurry?

KID ON SCOOTER

Down the corner, see the ruckus...

DOC WILSON

Watch the curbs, now...

DOC WILSON (CONT'D)

(of his suitcase)

Where you off to?

JOE

I, uh...I'm leaving...

DOC WILSON

Why?

JOE

I perjured myself.

(pause)

I told a lie, and I ruined my life.

That's what I did.

(shrugs)

I don't suppose you could help me with

that, could you?  Turn back the clock,

or something?  Give me back my, give me

back my purity, I don't suppose you

could just wave your magic wand and do

that, could you?  But what is truth?

Eh?  Ain't that the thing?  What is

true?

DOC WILSON

It's the truth that you should never

trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's

s'posed to point down to accentuate the

genitals, why'd you wanna trust

somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate

his ears?

JOE

Aren't you supposed to set an example

for people?

DOC WILSON

Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold

people's hands while they die.  What'd

you say your problem was?

JOE

I just swore my life away, back in

that...

DOC WILSON

(as he sees an older woman off

on a porch to the side)

Mornin', Chessy, how's the back?

JOE

I ruined my life.  Isn't that funny,

that you can actually do it in one

moment just like they say.  I ruined my

life back in that courthouse.

BELLHOP

What courthouse?

JOE

Courthouse back in town.

BELLHOP

Town ain't got no courthouse.

JOE

What?

BELLHOP

Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse

burnt down, 1960.

JOE

Well, where do they hold court?

BELLHOP

Hold court, they have to, science lab,

the high school.

STATION MASTER

Mornin', judge, what brings you here?

JUDGE

I'm s'posed to hear some deposition,

some fool saw the accident last night.

JOE

...the courthouse burnt down...?

STATION MASTER

Yep.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.  Part

of a spate of fires, Old Mill,

Courthouse... S'posed to've been set by

some deranged teenager.

STATION MASTER (CONT'D)

Yep, never did discover who set 'em...

ANN

I thought you needed to get it out of

your system.

SHERRY

...a blight, a blight and an

obscenity...that's good English, isn't

it?  How's that for entertainment?

ANN

What are you going to do?

JOE

I'm going to tell the truth.

DOUG

...and to exterminate this vermin, yes,

I use that term, who have abused, who

have desecrated, yes, the license

granted to them by a gracious nation...

DOUG (CONT'D)

...who spew filth and degradation...

(begins to wipe his head)

DOUG (CONT'D)

...thank you...

TV REPORTER

...you want to clean up?

DOUG

Yes, thank you.

TECHNICIAN

Five minutes, and we're going live to

the network.

DOUG

(to himself)

...foreign, and un-American perversions

of the Democratic process.  By those we

have entrusted with our dreams...

WALT

Do something.

MARTY

You tell me what to do, I'll do it.

WALT

...and I was just paying off my house in

Malibu...

WALT (CONT'D)

Thank G-d, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to

you...

JOE

I'm out.

WALT

I don't getcha.

JOE

The girl was in the car.

WALT

I treated you like a son or nephew.

JOE

It's no you, it's...

WALT

No, what is it?

JOE

I have to tell the truth.

WALT

...that's just so narrow...

JOE

The girl was in the car.

WALT

Then you're finished in show business.

JOE

So be it.

WALT

And my company sues your ass for sixty

million dollars.

JOE

For what cause?

WALT

I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.

HOWIE

I'm a lawyer.

MARTY

Howie...

HOWIE

Yeah?

MARTY

What are you doing here?

HOWIE

What am I doing here is I just flew

seven hours cause you asked me here.

WALT

What for?

HOWIE

(presenting the bag)

For this...I hope you need it, cause

it's coming outta your budget...

MARTY

Hi.

DOUG

I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.

MARTY

I....

DOUG

...you know, there's nothing you could

say, that could possibly make a

difference, so, why don't you just save

your breath...

DOUG (CONT'D)

What's in the case?

MARTY

Eight-hundred thousand dollars in cash.

DOUG

And what was it you wanted to say?

MARTY

Gut Yuntif.

JOE

(to Judge)

I've come to give myself up...

JUDGE

Well give yourself up to someone else.

I'm gonna get in some golf.  Hiya,

Annie.  Give yourself up to her.

DOUG

I have learned a lesson.  And the lesson

is this...that everybody needs a second

chance.  You, me, and these fine, film

people here.  You know, they have a high

profile, but that doesn't mean they

aren't deserving of our trust, and of

our respect.

You know, I think there is a lesson

here, and the lesson is this: it is a

lesson of Tolerance...and, as we look at

this industry, at this clean, American

industry, and as I begin my campaign for

congress...

FIRST A.D.

Okay.  Are we getting set up here...are

we getting set up...People...?  Can we

settle...can we settle now...?

FIRST A.D.

Okay, this is picture...

FIRST A.D. (CONT'D)

Quiet, please...

DOC MORTON

fire last night.

FIREMAN

We missed you in Church today, Frank.

BOB
