In any discussion of contemporary

America and how its people live, we

must inevitably start with --

Manhattan -- New York City, U.S.A!

Manhattan -- glistening, modern giant

of concrete and steel reaching to

the heavens and holding in its arms

seven millions!

Seven millions -- happy beneficiaries

of the advantages and comforts this

gracious metropolis has to offer...

Its fine broad streets and boulevards

facilitate the New Yorker's carefree,

orderly existence.

BILL

I suppose you're wondering what all

this has to do with Mr. Blandings

and his Dream House? Well, I'll tell

you. Jim Blandings is part of the

fabric of this town. Born and raised

right here, he's as typical a New

Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet.

At least he was.

(confidentially)

And if you want to know the real

story, I guess I'm your boy. Cole's

my name, Bill Cole. I'm Jim's lawyer

and quote, best friend, unquote.

Jim's one of those bright young men

from Yale. Advertising business,

lovely wife, two fine kids, makes

almost fifteen thousand a year. Want

to know why? Just look up there.

WHAM!

(A WHALE OF A HAM)

"WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE WHIM, SAY 'WHAM!'"

BILL'S VOICE

"When you've got the whim, say

'Wham!'"... Jim Blandings wrote that

slogan. Seven magic words that shine

like a beacon light for the American

housewife!

(impressive; almost

reverently)

"When you've got the whim, say

'Wham!'" Jim Blandings' contribution

to the American Scene.

BILL'S VOICE

For fourteen years Jim and Muriel

had been living in their apartment

over on East Seventy-fourth Street.

It was just another of those wonderful

crisp September mornings and the

Blandings were still asleep. Just

like millions of other people in

good old Manhattan -- New York City --

U.S.A.

BETSY'S VOICE

Okay, dad.

JIM

Mm.

JOAN

Okay, dad.

JIM

Mm.

GUSSIE

'Morning, Mr. Blandings!

JIM

(a feeble attempt at

a smile)

Mm.

JIM

Muriel.

MURIEL

Mm?

JIM

Coffee.

MURIEL

Thank you, dear.

MURIEL

Looking for something, dear?

JIM

(briefly)

My socks.

MURIEL

Why don't you look in your sock

drawer?

JIM

(with restraint)

That's where I found my underwear.

MURIEL

Oh.

(brightly)

Well, try your underwear drawer.

JIM

I'm in my underwear drawer.

MURIEL

(sipping coffee)

Well, they must be somewhere.

(attempt at morning

cheeriness)

Socks just don't get up and walk

away by themselves.

JIM

(strained patience)

Muriel, I thought the top two-and-a-

half drawers were to be mine! I wish

you'd tell Gussie --

MURIEL

The closet! That's where they are.

We put them in the closet.

JIM

Socks? In the closet?

MURIEL

Well, there didn't seem to be any

room in the drawers...

JIM

And there's so much of it in the

closet!

MURIEL

...so Gussie and I decided that from

now on we'll keep them in a basket

on the shelf.

JIM

Well, thanks a lot!

MURIEL

Jim, I do wish you'd make an effort

to be a little less clumsy.

JIM

(barely containing

himself)

I'll try, dear.

JOAN

(sharply)

Father, just one morning I wish you'd

knock!

JIM

(to her back as she

walks away)

'Morning, dear.

DISSOLVE

MURIEL

(reaching for

toothbrush)

Excuse...

JIM

Excuse...

JIM

(impatiently)

If you don't mind, dear.

MURIEL

(as she steps in front

of him)

Sorry.

MURIEL

Moment, dear.

JIM

Take your time. I can spare the blood.

MURIEL

(looks up)

Oh... cut yourself?

JIM

I cut myself every morning. I kind

of look forward to it.

MURIEL

Why don't you get an electric razor?

JIM

(trying to shave)

Don't like them. No close shave.

MURIEL

Ridiculous! Bill Cole's been using

one for years.

JIM

He doesn't have my beard!

MURIEL

That's silly. Bill's beard is just

as tough and coarse and --

JIM

(irritably)

I'm not interested in discussing the

grain and texture of Bill Cole's

hair follicles before I've had my

orange juice.

MURIEL

You don't have to carry on so. I

only said, why don't you get an

electric razor?

JIM

Because I prefer the cool, clean

sweep of the tempered steel as it

glides smoothly --

MURIEL

Stop writing advertising copy! Hurry

up, dear, you'll be late for

breakfast.

DISSOLVE

JIM

...Who did this?

BETSY

(very matter-of-factly)

I did.

JIM

I have repeatedly told you --

(ducking as Gussie

comes back with coffee)

-- don't cut up the morning paper

until I've had a chance to look at

it!

BETSY

I'm sorry, father. It's necessary

research.

JIM

(with some sarcasm)

I suppose this is another of Miss

Stellwagon's so-called Progressive

Projects?

MURIEL

(using salt and handing

it to Jim)

Now dear, there just isn't any point

in sending your children to an

expensive school if you're going to

undermine the teacher's authority in

your own dining room.

JIM

I'm not undermining anything. I happen

to be in the advertising business

and keeping abreast of the times is

important to me.

MURIEL

And so is your children's education.

JIM

That's not the point.

MURIEL

It certainly is.

JIM

It certainly is not!

JOAN

(without looking up

from her magazine)

Bicker, bicker, bicker.

JIM

You eat your cornflakes!

MURIEL

(handing Joan toast)

Joan, every time your father and I

have a lively discussion we aren't

necessarily bickering.

(to Betsy; solicitously)

What is it, dear, another English

composition?

BETSY

(taking toast from

Joan)

Miss Stellwagon has assigned each of

us to take a want ad and write a

human interest theme about it.

(to Jim; passing toast

to him)

I found one typical of the

disintegration of our present society.

JIM

(taking toast, not

looking up from his

paper)

I wasn't aware of the fact that our

society was disintegrating.

BETSY

I didn't expect you to be, father.

Miss Stellwagon says that middle-

class people like us are all too

prone to overlook the pressures and

tensions which befall the less

fortunate members of our community.

JIM

(with great restraint)

Muriel, I know it's asking a lot,

but just one morning I would like to

sit down and have breakfast without

social significance!

MURIEL

Jim, you really might take a little

more interest in your children's

education.

JOAN

(without looking up)

You can't squeeze blood from a turnip.

JIM

All right. All right. I'll listen.

BETSY

(picking up her

scrapbook)

It's just twenty-four words. But in

simple eloquence it mirrors a minor

tragedy of our times.

JIM

(quietly)

Well?...

BETSY

(reading)

"Forced to sell. Farm dwelling, oak

grove, apple orchard, trout stream,

hay fields, four barns, seclusion,

superb view, original beams, paved

highway, acreage...

(with emotion)

Will sacrifice..."

JIM

Go on.

BETSY

(simply)

That's all.

JIM

That's all?!

BETSY

You don't see it, do you, father?

JIM

No. Fellow wants to sell a house so

he puts an ad in the paper. What did

you expect him to do, take it to the

United Nations!

MURIEL

There must be more to it than that.

(to Betsy)

Isn't there, dear?

BETSY

Certainly, mother. What some people

don't see is the whole sordid picture.

A poor, honest farmer, pushed to the

wall by hardship, soil erosion,

mortgages, everybody gobbling,

gobbling, gobbling, until finally,

in desperation, he is "forced to

sell," and stoops to the crass

commercialism of newspaper

advertising.

JIM

(muttering)

Oh, indeed... crass commercialism...

advertising...

JOAN

(nose in her magazine)

Miss Stellwagon says advertising is

a basically parasitic profession.

JIM

(with extreme control)

Oh, she does?

JOAN

Miss Stellwagon says that advertising

makes people who can't afford it buy

things they don't want with money

they haven't got.

JIM

(elaborate sarcasm)

Perhaps your Miss Stellwagon is right.

Perhaps I ought to get out of this

"basically parasitic profession,"

which at the moment is paying for

her very fancy tuition, those extra

French lessons, her progressive summer

camp and for that matter, the very

braces on your teeth!

MURIEL

I wish you wouldn't discuss money in

front of the children.

JIM

Why not, they spend enough of it!

JOAN

Bicker, bicker, bicker.

GUSSIE

Hello. Who?

(calls)

Miss Blandings, there's a Mr.

Funkhauser wants to see you.

MURIEL

Funkhauser?

(remembers)

Oh, Mr. Funkhauser!

GUSSIE

That's what he says.

MURIEL

Uh -- better ask him to come up.

GUSSIE

(into phone)

Says to come up.

MURIEL

(tentatively)

Oh -- uh -- darling, Mr. Funkhauser's

here.

JIM

(looking up)

...Who?

MURIEL

You remember, Bunny Funkhauser, that

clever young interior decorator we

met at the Collins' cocktail party?

JIM

(distastefully)

What's he doing here?

MURIEL

(nervously)

Well, I imagine he's brought the --

uh -- estimates.

JIM

(blankly)

...Estimates?

MURIEL

(rapidly; to conceal

a feeling of guilt)

Darling, you know how long we've

said we've got to do something about

this apartment, and, well, he called

last week, and I had him come over,

and he's got some simply wonderful

ideas!

JIM

(quietly)

There couldn't be two Bunny

Funkhausers, could there?

MURIEL

Why, no, dear.

JIM

Then this is the same clever young

man who's responsible for that zebra-

striped monstrosity in the Collins'

living room?

MURIEL

That couch is terribly functional.

JIM

Phil Collins told me what he paid

for all that function!

(angrily)

If you think I'm going to --

MURIEL

Darling, please!

(changing subject)

Children, you'll be late to school.

Run along and --

JOAN

Miss Stellwagon says that

functionalism in modern furniture --

MURIEL

Never mind, dear.

FUNKHAUSER

Good morning.

THE GIRLS

(with a sharp

appraising look)

Hi.

MURIEL

Good morning, Mr. Funkhauser. You

remember Mr. Blandings?

FUNKHAUSER

But of course.

FUNKHAUSER

You'll have to pardon my bursting in

at this dreary hour --

(puts a sketch on a

chair)

-- practically the middle of the

night --

(puts wallpaper against

mantel)

-- but I did so want to catch you

in. I've been at it hammer and tongs

all week and I'm just a mess --

(drapes bolt of chintz

over high-backed

chair)

-- but then Muriel and I thought we

ought to talk it over with you before

we take the plunge...

FUNKHAUSER

(smoothing out folds

on the chintz)

After all, it's your home, too, and

it should reflect you. You know,

Man's Castle, all that sort of thing.

JIM

(ominously)

Muriel!

MURIEL

(quickly)

Jim, just wait till you hear. He's

got some wonderful ideas for the

foyer.

FUNKHAUSER

Oh, that's out! All out! Changed the

whole thing! I just couldn't live

with it! I said to myself, "Bunny,

what are the Blandings? How shall we

do them?" And the answer was perfectly

obvious. Very American, very grass

roots, very blueberry pie -- that

sort of thing.

JIM

(dark look at Muriel)

Mm.

FUNKHAUSER

Now first, let's dig into this living

room of yours, it's really a dreary.

MURIEL

(quickly; to Jim)

We want this room to be very gay,

dear. Something in bright reds,

yellows and greens.

JIM

(appalled)

Red, yellow and green?!

FUNKHAUSER

Oh, come, Mr. Blandings, let's not

run away from color.

JIM

Not running away --

(a lame joke)

-- just backing off a little.

FUNKHAUSER

Uh -- yes.

(brightly)

Now as I see our room, it's definitely

Colonial. You know, cobbler's bench,

breakfront, pie cooler, student lamp,

hooked rug. But everything in good

taste. It must not jump out at you

and scream: "Look -- see how antique

I am!"

JIM

Heaven forbid.

FUNKHAUSER

Of course, these things take

imagination. You've simply got to be

able to visualize.

JIM

(politely, removing

chintz)

If you'll forgive me, Mr. Funkhauser,

what I'd like to visualize -- at

this dreary hour -- is how much is

this all going to cost?

FUNKHAUSER

Well, really, I hesitate to say.

After all --

(indicates)

-- by the time this wall is out we

may find --

JIM

(reacting)

This wall is -- what?

FUNKHAUSER

Out. Source of light is from the

east. Obviously if our room is to

have any function at all --

JIM

You're going to tear out the wall?!

MURIEL

Dear, it's a wonderful notion.

FUNKHAUSER

Visualize three feet of leaded panes,

the rest --

JIM

Can you give me a figure?

FUNKHAUSER

Well! Costs aren't what they used to

be, you know, and --

JIM

Just a figure.

FUNKHAUSER

Materials are impossible, labor has

just run wild --

JIM

Just an overall figure.

FUNKHAUSER

Well!... I shouldn't like to be tied

down. But I suppose if you must have

a figure, I'd say -- mm --

(lightly)

-- somewhere in the neighborhood of

seven.

JIM

Mm... Seven.

FUNKHAUSER

(nodding)

Mm.

JIM

That would be seven... thousand?

FUNKHAUSER

Mm.

JIM

(soberly)

We-ll. That seems fair.

(gathering up materials)

After all, we're not running away

from color --

(picks up wallpaper)

-- and we are tearing out walls --

(picks up sketches)

Mr. Funkhauser, do you have a card?

MURIEL

Jim, we haven't even discussed the

rest of the house.

JIM

We will, dear.

(leads the whole batch

on Funkhauser)

FUNKHAUSER

(huffy)

Well, really, I --

JIM

(deftly steering him

toward the door)

We'll talk it all out and then we'll

get in touch with Bunny.

FUNKHAUSER

Well, really, I mean, I was under

the impression we'd come to some

decision today.

JIM

I'm sure we will.

FUNKHAUSER

We-ll!

JIM

So nice of you to come.

(puts Funkhauser's

hat on his head)

Good day.

MURIEL

(apprehensively)

Now darling, you -- you just don't

go to a man like Funkhauser and ask

how much it's going to cost before

you even know what he's going to do!

JIM

No, that would be too logical! Seven

thousand dollars! Blueberry pie! I

wouldn't put seventy-five cents into

this broken-down rat trap!

MURIEL

(sentimentally)

It's our home, Jim. Betsy was

practically born in this apartment.

JIM

That does not make it a national

shrine!

(vehemently)

Seven thousand dollars and not one

word about closets.

MURIEL

Closets! You wouldn't even let him

get to the bathroom!

JIM

I haven't got that kind of money!

MURIEL

The way you talk, Jim Blandings,

you'd think I was some kind of

congenital idiot!

JIM

Sometimes I'm beginning to wonder!

MURIEL

(furious)

You can just get out of here!

JIM

That's not a bad idea!

Sorry.

MARY

Good morning, Mr. Blandings.

JIM

(briefly)

'Morning.

MARY

You wanted to see the color copy

from this month's House and Stream.

MARY'S VOICE

Will that be all?

JIM

(looking up; blankly)

Hm?

MARY

Will that be all?

BETSY'S VOICE

"Forced to sell. Farm dwelling, oak

grove, apple orchard, trout stream,

hay fields, four barns, original

beams --"

DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

Well, that's the way it all started.

The ad was enough to convince Jim --

DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

-- But Muriel was a little tougher.

I guess the corsage did it.

DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

There they are, two little fish from

New York -- out in the deep deep

waters of Connecticut real estate.

That's Smith, the real estate

salesman. Mighty shrewd cookie in a

quiet sort of way. Never thought

he'd get a bite this quick.

BILL'S VOICE

Now he's sizing up the catch. "Mm.

Let's see. Convertible -- orchids --

must be pretty well fixed. Wonder if

they're lookers or buyers?"

BILL'S VOICE

They're buyers.

(confidentially)

Yes, sir, Smith, looks like you're

finally going to unload the old

Hackett place. Now first thing is

get 'em a little anxious.

BILL'S VOICE

Th-a-a-t's right!

DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

Uh-uh, not yet.

DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

Take it easy, Smith, give 'em a little

more line.

DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

Now we're ready to gaff 'em.

SMITH

(proudly)

Well, folks, there she is -- the old

Hackett Place.

SMITH'S VOICE

Fifty mighty pretty little acres...

MURIEL

(involuntarily)

It's simply charming!

MURIEL

That is, for an old house.

JIM

(casually)

Of course, you understand, Mr. Smith,

we're just window shopping, so to

speak. Nothing really definite in

mind.

SMITH

Perfectly all right.

JIM

(studies house; with

assumed indifference)

Mm. Not a bad-looking place, but

it's certainly a lot older than

anything we had in mind.

SMITH

She's no spring chicken --

(sagely)

-- but that's just what makes her

such a buy.

SMITH

This isn't just old timber, or a

virgin stand oak grove other side of

the trout stream, or a couple of

fruit orchards... You're buying a

piece of American history.

JIM

(interested in spite

of himself)

You don't say! How's that?

SMITH

First year she was built, General

Gates stopped right here to water

his horses.

JIM

(impressed)

Oh! Old General Gates -- Civil War.

SMITH

Revolutionary War.

JIM

Oh. Oh, that General Gates. Hear

that, honey, General Gates!

MURIEL

(with concern)

Wouldn't that make the house over a

hundred years old?

SMITH

(proudly)

Hundred and seventy come next April.

SMITH

Now I'm not trying to sell you

anything -- all I'm saying is that

one of these days someone with a

little vision and imagination's goin'

to come along, and just steal this

place --

(confidentially)

and I mean steal it.

SMITH

Mr. Blandings, I know you can look

at that house and just about picture

what a couple of coats of paint and

a little pointing up here and there

can do to it.

JIM

Mm.

JIM'S VOICE

Hm. Wonder what he meant by "steal?"

SMITH

And I guess I don't have to tell

you, Mrs. Blandings, what a woman's

touch could do to a place like this.

MURIEL

Well --

MURIEL'S VOICE

It is a nice old house. It just needs

someone to love it, that's all.

SMITH

Yes, sir, you've certainly got to

visualize.

$9,000.00

$9,000.00

$11,000.00

SMITH

(brightly)

Shall we go up and take a look at

her?

MURIEL

(a little too casual)

Well -- I -- suppose as long as we're

here...

JIM

(same)

I guess it doesn't hurt to take a

look.

MURIEL

(sotto)

It does have possibilities. Do you

think we can get it?

JIM

(sotto)

Like taking candy from a baby.

MURIEL

(same)

Now don't lose your head.

JIM

(same)

Shh. Just keep quiet and let me handle

this.

JIM

Tell me, Smith, what kind of a price

is the owner asking for this old

place?

DISSOLVE

MURIEL

It's wonderful, Jim! That master

bedroom with those two closets!

JIM

Shh!

MURIEL

Funkhauser could do wonders with

this --

JIM

(firmly)

Funkhauser will have nothing to do

with this house! Shh!

HACKETT

(calling)

Hi, George!

SMITH

Hi, Eph!

(to the Blandings;

feigned surprise)

What do you know, it's Eph Hackett,

owner of the place!

JIM

(pleased)

Well, you don't say.

SMITH

Eph, this is Mr. and Mrs. Blandings --

from New York City.

HACKETT

Howdy.

THE BLANDINGS

How do you do?

MURIEL

You certainly have a lovely place

here, Mr. Hackett.

HACKETT

(briefly)

Ye-ap.

JIM

(pleasantly)

Mr. Hackett, we've just been talking

to Smith here about -- uh -- taking

the old place off your hands.

HACKETT

(firmly)

Ain't for sale!

SMITH

(smoothly)

Why don't you folks just go out in

back and take a look at the orchard?

HACKETT

How'm I doin', George?

SMITH

Nice timin', Eph. Think we got

something here.

HACKETT

They the same people you showed it

to in nineteen-thirty-eight?

SMITH

They were lookers -- this is the

real thing.

HACKETT

If they got five thousand dollars on

'em. don't let 'em get away.

SMITH

They already offered ten.

HACKETT

(mildly)

Y'don't say... What's my asking price?

SMITH

Fifteen...

HACKETT

A mite stiff...

SMITH

I've got 'em measured.

(mellower)

They're gonna take the place for --

(turns, looks back at

house)

eleven thousand.

HACKETT

Make it eleven thousand five hundred

fifty.

SMITH

Odd kind of figure.

HACKETT

Might as well take the commission

out of them instead of me.

DISSOLVE

JIM

(singing gaily to

"Home On The Range")

"Home, home in Connecticut With a

closet to hang up your petticut..."

MURIEL

(as he seats himself)

...Jim?

JIM

(going on, as he places

his napkin in his

lap)

"No hustle or fuss No Fifth Avenue

bus --"

MURIEL

Uh -- Jim?

JIM

Hm?

MURIEL

I was just wondering, dear. Ten

thousand dollars is such an awful

lot to offer --

MURIEL

That is, for two people who don't

know anything at all about real

estate, or anything...

(Jim's look darkens)

I mean, don't you think perhaps we

should have asked someone's

professional advice?

JIM

Like... say... a lawyer?

MURIEL

Well, Bill knows about these things

and --

JIM

Muriel, for once in my life I'm going

to make one small decision, on my

own, without the legalistic

machinations of Mr. Bill Cole.

MURIEL

It seems very peculiar that when

your very best friend happens to be

one of the very cleverest young

lawyers in New York City --

JIM

Muriel, I don't want to hear another

word about Bill Cole!

(turns to children)

Well, did your mother tell you about

the house?

BETSY

Yes.

JIM

Well?

JOAN

Miss Stellwagon says the current

craze for modernizing old farmhouses

is a form of totem worship.

JIM

(with great restraint)

Did it ever occur to you two that

there may be some remote, intangible

subjects upon which your Miss Irma

Stellwagon is not the final authority?

JOAN

Why don't we buy a Solaxion house?

JIM

...You know it's just barely

conceivable -- What kind of a house?

JOAN

Solaxion. It's built on a mast like

a tent and it revolves with the sun.

JIM

Oh, it... revolves... with the sun?

JOAN

That's right.

JIM

Who lives next door -- Buck Rogers?!

JOAN

It's the only practical way to live.

When a new model comes out you trade

the old one in like a used car.

JIM

(plaintively)

Muriel --

MURIEL

Children, you haven't even seen this

house yet.

BETSY

Personally, I'd like a Crane Mobile

home. It comes all folded up and all

you do is plug it in for electricity

and water and --

JIM

Now just a minute!

(to Muriel)

What kind of children are these?

(to girls)

Do you want to spend the rest of

your lives in chromium tents and

portable merry-go-rounds? This house

was built before our country became

a nation. It has dignity. It's --

it's --

GUSSIE

(handing it to Jim)

Special delivery, Mr. Blandings.

JIM

(with suppressed;

excitement)

From Smith!

JIM

Mm.

MURIEL

Well?

JIM

(reading)

"I have conveyed your offer of ten

thousand dollars to Mr. Hackett and

am sorry to say he is not interested.

However, I feel..."

MURIEL

Oh, dear. Maybe we should have gone

a few dollars higher.

JIM

(stoutly)

He's bluffing. Simple as that.

JOAN

For ten thousand dollars we could

get a Rockford Trailer and a Zamboni

Power Unit. It's kitchen, bathroom

and air conditioning all rolled up

into --

JIM

(firmly)

Muriel, I'll let him push me to ten

thousand, two hundred, but not a

penny more!

DISSOLVE

SMITH'S VOICE

"Dear Mr. Blandings: While your offer

of ten thousand two hundred is still

not acceptable to Ephemus Hackett --

JIM'S VOICE

"Dear Mr. Smith: You may inform Mr.

Hackett that the very highest I could

possibly go --"

DISSOLVE

JIM

(not too sure)

What do you think, Bill? Steal, huh?

BILL

(drily)

It certainly is.

BILL

Perhaps "steal" is an understatement --

"swindle" might be a little more

appropriate.

JIM

(with pride)

Well, it wasn't much, Bill. I just

saw a good thing and I --

(take)

What do you mean?

BILL

Every time you get a little tight

you weep on my shoulder about the

advertising business and how it forces

a sensitive soul like yourself to

make a living by bamboozling the

American public.

(picks up Smith's

correspondence)

I would say that a small part of

this victimized group has now

redressed the balance.

JIM

What are you talking about?

BILL

You! You've been taken to the cleaners

and you don't even know your pants

are off!

MURIEL

Dear, I told you. I said we should

call Bill --

JIM

Never mind, Muriel!

(to Bill; challengingly)

All right, just what's wrong with

this deal?

BILL

First time around you offered ten

thousand dollars for fifty acres,

right?

JIM

What of it?

BILL

That's two hundred dollars an acre.

I know that part of Connecticut and

one hundred dollars an acre is

standard top-gouge price to city

slickers. When the natives sell to

each other it's around forty or less.

MURIEL

Forty dollars an acre!

JIM

The man's entitled to a fair profit.

BILL

Not two hundred and eighty-four

percent.

(indicates papers)

And besides, you're not getting fifty

acres, you're only getting thirty-

five, more or less.

JIM

Where does it say that?

BILL

(picks up letter)

I refer to a rather obscure post-

script on the back of the second

letter from Friend Smith.

MURIEL

(reading)

"Incidentally, Mr. Hackett has been

a little over-optimistic about the

acreage. It will probably survey

somewhere in the neighborhood of

thirty-five acres, more or less, but

I feel sure..."

JIM

(on the defensive)

All right, so it's thirty-five! What's

the difference? Do you know how many

tennis courts you can get on thirty-

five acres?

BILL

You're not spending eleven thousand

five hundred dollars for tennis

courts!

JIM

That's not the point!

BILL

(very businesslike)

That's precisely the point. We're

going to write this Hackett a strong

letter and tell him he can either

kick in with those fifteen acres,

reduce the price, or find another

sucker.

JIM

(rising emotion)

We'll do no such thing! I'm not going

to queer this deal over fifteen broken-

down acres!

MURIEL

(to Bill)

We were just going window shopping

and so far it's cost us eleven

thousand five hundred dollars and

they even made us pay the commission!

JIM

You don't understand business.

BILL

You mean extortion.

MURIEL

(thoughtfully)

I wonder if we could get another two

year lease on the apartment?

JIM

(heatedly)

Now wait a minute! You can't measure

everything on a slide rule. This

house has certain intangibles.

BILL

Like what, for instance?

JIM

Like antique value, for instance! It

just so happens that General Gates

stopped right there, at that very

house, to water his horses.

BILL

I don't care if General Grant dropped

in for a scotch and soda -- you're

still getting rocked!

JIM

That was a different war!

MURIEL

I think Bill's absolutely right.

JIM

(struggling to contain

himself; quietly)

Let me explain something. To both of

you. For fifteen years I've been

cooped up in a four room cracker

box! Just getting shaved in the

morning entitles a man to the

Congressional Medal for bravery.

BILL

That doesn't make this a good buy.

JIM

Bill -- Muriel and I have found what

I am not ashamed to call our Dream

House. It's like a fine painting.

You buy it with your heart, not your

head. You don't ask, how much was

the canvas, how much was the paint?

You look at it and you say, "It's

beautiful... I want it," and if it

costs a few pennies more you pay it --

and gladly -- because you love it

and you can't measure the things you

love in dollars and cents!

JIM

(emotionally spent)

Well -- that's how I feel about this

place. And when I sign those papers

Saturday, I can look the world in

the face and say, "It's mine! My

house! My home! My thirty-five acres!"

MURIEL

(coming over; moved,

touched)

Our house. Our home. Our thirty-five

acres...

BILL

...more or less...

JIM

(reacting)

What was that? How many acres?

BILL

(precisely)

Thirty-one and a half.

JIM

(to Hackett)

I was under the impression your

property was thirty-five acres, Mr.

Hackett.

HACKETT

It is... more or less.

SMITH

You see, Mr. Blandings, when you

signed the purchase agreement it was

subject to traced map attached.

Surveyed to an even thirty-one and a

half acres.

JUDGE QUARLES

Anything wrong?

BILL

It's nothing, Your Honor, just a few

less tennis courts.

resonance)

SHRUNK MILLS

DISSOLVE

BILL

(drily)

Congress ought to pass a law. When a

man buys a house in Lansdale County

there's a prize -- he gets ten percent

off if he can find it.

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

JIM

What in the world are "Shrunk Mills?"

BILL

They are probably mills that have

shrunk.

MURIEL

Well, you certainly aren't much of a

help.

BILL

(wearily)

Look -- you really want to find that

house of yours -- it's no problem.

BILL

Just pretend you're one of General

Gates' horses and you're thirsty...

Now where would you go for a drink

of water?

DISSOLVE

BILL

(frank and open)

Well, I must admit it's a very

beautiful thing.

MURIEL

(misty)

The house and the lilac are just the

same age, Bill; if the lilac can

live and be so old, so can the house.

It just needs someone to love it,

that's all.

BILL

It's a good thing there are two of

you -- one to love it and one to

hold it up.

BILL

What'd your engineer say when he

checked over the foundation and that

roof?

JIM

Who needs engineers? This isn't a

train, you know.

BILL

I just saw it move.

JIM

This house has been standing since

the second year of the Continental

Congress. You take one look at it

and shingles start to fall off!

BILL

(solicitously)

Look -- let me do you a favor. I've

got a client, crackerjack structural

engineer, Joe Apollonio; he

practically built the George

Washington Bridge single-handed.

JIM

Thanks a lot, but we're not building

a bridge.

BILL

He's the follow who advised the

Government not to raise the Normandie --

they didn't listen to him, cost them

five million dollars.

JIM

You have my word, if I were raising

the Normandie, I wouldn't make a

move without Apollonio.

(indicates door)

Now would you like to come inside

and look around?

BILL

(a skeptical look at

the roof)

No thanks, I'll just stay out in the

car and listen to "Life Can Be

Beautiful."

MURIEL

I think you'd better contact Mr.

Apollonio.

DISSOLVE

MURIEL

It has charm, hasn't it, Mr.

Apollonio?

APOLLONIO

(through his cigar)

Uh-huh.

JIM

Of course, any small changes would

have to conform with the character

of the countryside.

APOLLONIO

(through his cigar)

Mm-hmm.

MURIEL

And yet still be functional.

APOLLONIO

(gazing upward;

oblivious)

Uh-huh.

JIM

Well, uh, what's your professional

opinion?

APOLLONIO

Tear it down.

JIM

(appalled)

Tear it down??!

APOLLONIO

If your chimney was shot and your

sills was okay, I'd say go ahead,

fix her up. If your sills was shot

and your chimney was okay, again I'd

say go ahead, fix her up. But your

sills are shot and your chimney is

shot.

APOLLONIO

(beckoning)

Take a look at the way she sags.

APOLLONIO

So I say don't throw good money after

bad -- tear it down.

JIM

(coolly)

Thanks a lot.

APOLLONIO

It's okay.

JIM

(bitterly)

Bill Cole and his experts!

MURIEL

(bitterly)

Darling, we'll get our own experts.

DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

And so they got their own experts.

Mr. Simpson said --

SIMPSON

Tear it down.

FAST DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

On the other hand, Mr. Murphy said --

MURPHY

I think you'd better tear it down.

FAST DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

And then just to be a wee bit

different, Mr. Jones said --

JONES

(firmly; deep bass

voiced)

Tear it down!

DISSOLVE

HENRY L. SIMMS

ARCHITECT

BILL'S VOICE

And that's how our friend, Mr. Simms,

came into it.

DISSOLVE

SIMMS

Of course you could fix up that old

house. You can fix up any structure

that's still standing. The sills and

floors couldn't be worse, I grant

you, and I guess you'd have to jack

up that west corner at least three

feet to make it level. Need new

chimney. New roof. Complete new

plumbing.

(sigh)

Too bad you didn't buy it ten years

ago. Could have fixed it up in jig

time then, and it would have made

some sense.

JIM

(nervously nibbling

at his nails)

Uh-huh... mm-hmmm... uh-huh.

SIMMS

Fact is, before you're through, it

would be less expensive to tear the

old place down and build a new one,

same size.

JIM

Mm. New house...

(as the notion sinks

in, becomes attractive)

New house.

MURIEL

(to Simms, with

pleasant incredulity)

You mean... for the same money... we

could build a brand new house?

SIMMS

It certainly wouldn't cost any more.

JIM

(soberly)

Hm... New house...

JIM

(tentatively)

Just... what sort of thing do you

have in mind?

SIMMS

Well, I imagine the type of house

you'd want would be something in

quiet good taste, two story, frame

and brick veneer construction --

modern, but of course fitting in

with the architectural traditions of

the countryside.

JIM

Well, I -- What do you think, Muriel?

MURIEL

I think it sounds fine.

SIMMS

Perhaps you'd like to see a basic

floor plan --

(reaches into file

behind him)

-- something like this.

SIMMS

First floor. Living room, study,

dining room, kitchen, service porch,

maid's room -- upstairs three family

bedrooms with two adjoining baths.

MURIEL

It's very nice, I'm sure, but -- uh --

well -- doesn't it seem just a little

bit conventional?

JIM

Yes, Simms, if we were going to build

a house we want it -- well, you know --

just a little bit different.

SIMMS

(he's heard all this

before)

Yes, of course.

JIM

Now, for instance --

(takes Simms' pencil)

JIM'S VOICE

-- here in the study if we could

just push out this wall a little --

and put in a built-in bar we could --

MURIEL'S VOICE

Excuse me, dear --

MURIEL'S VOICE

These bedrooms. They do seem rather

small. And, of course we'd have to

have a little dressing room -- and --

JIM'S VOICE

And closets, Simms, lots of closets.

(traces them in)

If there's one thing this family

needs, it's closets.

SIMMS' VOICE

(as his hand reaches

for the pencil)

If I might make a suggestion --

MURIEL'S VOICE

(as she draws them in)

And bathrooms, Mr. Simms. Each bedroom

must have at least one bathroom.

SIMMS' VOICE

But that would be four bathrooms,

Mrs. Blandings --

(his hand reaches for

the pencil)

I think I'd better point out to you --

JIM'S VOICE

Just a minute. Do you think --

(tracing)

we might manage a little playroom in

the basement, nothing tremendous,

you know, something like this --

SIMMS' VOICE

(as his hand reaches

for the pencil;

cautiously)

Well, it's always possible, but at

the moment our fundamental problem --

MURIEL'S VOICE

(as she traces)

And I've always wanted a little sewing

room upstairs --

(Jim's and Simms'

fingers drum

impatiently)

You know, a little utility room where

I can be alone, and sew, or sulk, or

on a rainy afternoon...

JIM'S VOICE

(as his hand takes

pencil)

Pardon me, dear. On that playroom,

Simms, not too small. You know, plenty

of room for ping-pong, darts, nice

big poker table...

SIMMS' VOICE

(as his hand reaches

for another pencil)

If you don't mind, I --

MURIEL'S VOICE

...And off the kitchen, I'd like a

little flower sink just to putter

around in...

JIM'S VOICE

...And a terrace off the study, with

an owning and little outdoor

fireplace...

DISSOLVE

SIMMS

(delicately)

We-ll... let's just see what we have

here. In the first place --

SIMMS' VOICE

-- I'm afraid you've got the upstairs

about twice as big as the downstairs.

JIM'S VOICE

It's all those bathrooms.

MURIEL'S VOICE

It is not, it's all those closets.

SIMMS

By extending this breakfast room

you've eliminated the possibility of

any stairs going to the second floor.

JIM

Oh, you can just shove those stairs

in anywhere.

SIMMS

(patiently; almost

paternally)

And, Mrs. Blandings, on that sewing

room, the way you have it now, the

chimney stack would come up right

through the middle of the room,

leaving you with something in the

shape of a square doughnut.

(tactfully)

Which, of course, might be very warm

in winter, but otherwise of doubtful

utility.

MURIEL

You could always move the chimney

somewhere else, couldn't you?

SIMMS

We-ll...

(rising; resigned to

his fate but tactful)

Look, I think I know just about what

you two have in mind. Why don't I go

ahead with some preliminary plans

and --

JIM

(hearty)

You do that, Simms, but remember,

we've got to hold it down to ten

thousand.

SIMMS

(candid)

That, I can tell you right now, is

impossible. Even with a considerable

trimming of the things you've

indicated, I don't see how we can

bring it in for less than twelve or

twelve-five.

JIM

Twelve-five!

(looks at Muriel;

then)

Well, I guess we're not going to

quibble about a few pennies one way

or the other.

MURIEL

(can't resist)

No, you'll find Mr. Blandings never

quibbles about pennies.

SIMMS

And -- uh -- have you any notions

about how you'd like the old place

taken down?

JIM

(a rueful joke)

Why don't we just blow on it?

SIMMS

(wry smile)

There's a good local house wrecker.

I'll have him contact you.

JIM

Fine. You just shoot ahead with those

plans, and remember, try to keep it

down to ten, ten-five.

SIMMS

(doubtfully)

Well -- we'll try.

JIM

There's one good thing about getting

that old relic down. Those original

beams and everything -- this time

somebody pays us.

DISSOLVE

HACKETT

Them beams is worth money. You payin'

him, or he payin' you?

WRECKER

He's payin' me.

HACKETT

How much?

WRECKER

(hesitating)

A thousand.

HACKETT

A thousand!

WRECKER

He squawked, but he paid.

HACKETT

(drily)

Hmm. I guess maybe I got a little

somethin' comin' too.

VOICE

Okay, boys, let her go!

JIM

(sigh)

Well, so far it's cost us thirteen

thousand, three hundred and twenty-

nine dollars and forty-five cents.

MURIEL

But we've got the nicest vacant lot

in the state of Connecticut.

DISSOLVE

SIMMS' VOICE

(wearily)

Something will have to give somewhere,

that I know.

MURIEL

It's impossible. I don't see how we

can cut another inch.

JIM

Honey, you heard Simms. As the house

stands now it's over fifteen thousand

dollars!

MURIEL

Well, it just doesn't seem possible --

(afterthought)

for a house with such small rooms.

SIMMS

(patiently)

Mrs. Blandings, I've already

explained. It's not only the size of

the rooms so much as it is the number.

You see, our primary problem is one

of cubage --

JIM

That's right, dear, cubage.

MURIEL

What's that?

JIM

Oh --

(sorry he got into it)

just a figure of speech.

MURIEL

But what does it mean?

JIM

(a little irritably)

Cubage. It's just the number of cubic

feet that --

(lost, lamely)

-- go into a cubic foot. Go on, Simms.

SIMMS

(consulting plans)

Now is it absolutely essential for

each of your daughters to have her

own room with two closets and a

separate bath?

JIM

(a look at the girls;

clearing his throat)

Yes. You see, er, my daughters are,

er, approaching womanhood, and, er --

SIMMS

(brief look at the

girls)

I hadn't realized they were

approaching it quite so fast.

(to Jim)

Perhaps what you need is not so much

a house as a series of little

bungalows.

JIM

Hmmm.

(examining plans)

What about that silly flower sink?

We could eliminate that.

MURIEL

I beg your pardon.

JIM

Or that sewing room upstairs, that's

certainly a waste.

MURIEL

If we're going to eliminate anything,

we'll lose that ridiculous play room

in the basement with that great big

poker table.

JIM

Honey, I've got to have some

relaxation.

MURIEL

We've got thirty-one and a half acres.

Go out in the back and do a little

gardening.

JIM

Sure, and get poison ivy!

SIMMS

(with dogged patience)

If I may interrupt, I'd like to

suggest that none of these are really

major eliminations. Now if we could

do with one less bathroom on the

second floor --

MURIEL

I'm sorry. We couldn't possibly.

SIMMS

Mrs. Blandings, a simple bathroom,

eight by ten by eight with grade A

fixtures will cost around thirteen

hundred dollars.

MURIEL

I refuse to endanger the health of

my children in a house with less

than four bathrooms.

JIM

For thirteen hundred dollars they

can live in a house with three

bathrooms and rough it!

SIMMS

Look, perhaps the most practical

thing would be --

BETSY

Oh, look, we're in the Lansdale paper!

(reading)

"Historical Society Blasts Vandalism!"

JIM

Muriel, Simms explained to you. We've

just got to cut, cut --

(reacts)

What's that?

BETSY

(reading)

"Censure Vote Passed re Destruction

of Famed Hackett Edifice."

JIM

Well, isn't that just too bad! Let

me see that.

MURIEL

What's so funny.

JIM

(laughing)

Prutty. Mrs. Bildad Prutty. Get a

load of this!

(reads)

"The semi-monthly meeting of the

Lansdale Historical Society was turned

into an uproar last night when its

president, Mrs. Bildad Prutty" --

How do you like that, Bildad Prutty? --

"reported the total demolition by

its New York buyer of the historic

old Hackett house."

(laughs)

Bildad Prutty! Muriel, I've got to

send this to the New Yorker!

BETSY

(drily)

Read on, father.

JIM

(scans paper)

"Mrs. Prutty," -- Bildad, that is --

"reminded her audience that several

years ago the Society started to

raise a fund to purchase and restore

the old house to its original

condition."

(looks up, laughs

scornfully)

BETSY

Read on, father.

JIM

(back to paper)

"The project fell through by being

seven hundred dollars short of the

sum of twenty-six hundred dollars..."

(Jim slows down as

the following

registers)

"...which Ephemus Hackett testified

was the lowest reasonable price he

could accept as --"

JIM

(weakly)

...Twenty-six hundred dollars.

BETSY

And what did we pay, father?

JOAN

Eleven-five, with the commission.

JIM

Muriel, isn't it time for those

children to be in bed?

MURIEL

Now girls, I don't want to tell you

again.

MURIEL

Excuse me.

JIM'S VOICE

Twenty-six hundred dollars!

SIMMS' VOICE

(comfortingly)

I wouldn't be too concerned about

Mrs. Prutty and her committee. After

all, it's your property and if you

want to tear it down --

MURIEL

(surprised)

Why, Bill!

BILL

(briefly)

Hello, Muriel.

(he strides past her

waving a telegram;

to Jim)

Well, you've done it again'. Once,

just once, why don't you come to me

and find out if it's all right, if

it's legal, before you go barging

off and run yourself smack into

another jam!

JIM

What's eating you?

BILL

(ignoring him; to

Simms)

And I must say, Simms, I hold you

equally responsible!

JIM

(alarmed)

What? What happened?

SIMMS

I'm afraid I don't understand.

BILL

(to Simms; indicating

Jim)

Did you let this idiot tear down

that house?

JIM

What if he did? What of it?

SIMMS

(to Bill)

Reconstruction was unsound and totally

impractical.

BILL

I quite agree. But you're dealing

with a man who doesn't think before

he acts, who goes off half-cocked!

JIM

What is it? What did I do?

BILL

(ignoring him; to

Simms)

You're an architect! You must have

been aware of the legality involved.

JIM

What? What legality?

BILL

(to Simms)

You knew there was a mortgage on

that house.

SIMMS

I assumed as much.

JIM

What happened? What are you talking

about?

BILL

(ignoring him; to

Simms)

And you know the requirements in

regard to a mortgage where there's

demolition intended!

SIMMS

Certainly. But since you were his

lawyer, I naturally assumed --

BILL

With a man like this you can't assume

anything!

JIM

(loudly)

Just one minute! I am entitled to

know what I did! This is America! A

man's guilty until he's proven

innocent --

BETSY

It's the other way around, father.

JIM

You go to bed!

MURIEL

Girls!

JIM

Bill, I've had a very trying day.

Would you mind telling me in clear,

concise English just what crime I've

committed -- and why?!

BILL

(with weary resignation)

In clear, concise English, you tore

down a house on which another man

holds a mortgage without first getting

his written permission.

JIM

Well, I -- I did?!

BILL

And in such case, the mortgagee can

demand the full payment of said

mortgage upon demand --

(waves telegram)

and Mr. Ephemus Hackett so demands!

Six thousand clams! And he wants

them now!

JIM

(appalled)

Now?!

BILL

You've got ten days.

JOAN

For six thousand dollars we could

have had a Solaxion house and a Crane

Mobile home.

JIM

Muriel!

MURIEL

(herding the kids

toward the door)

Girls, say your good nights and off

to bed without another word.

BETSY

(reluctantly)

Good night, Mr. Simms. Uncle Bill.

JOAN

(protesting)

Miss Stellwagon says the problems of

the parents should be the problems

of the children.

MURIEL

(shooing them out)

You keep that in mind, dear. It'll

help prepare you for motherhood.

SIMMS

Perhaps we'd better let the plans go

for the time being and --

JIM

(weakly)

No, Simms, I'll work this out. You

go ahead with your final plans and

let's see some estimates.

MURIEL

And we'll just forget about that

extra bathroom.

SIMMS

(preparing to leave)

Very well. You'll hear from me as

soon as possible. Good night.

JIM

(defeated)

Six thousand dollars!

BILL

What'll you do for collateral on

your building loan?

JIM

I don't know, turn in my insurance

policies or something.

MURIEL

(coming into scene)

Now, Jim, you can't do that.

JIM

Why not?

MURIEL

What if something should happen? You

can't leave the children unprotected.

JIM

(somewhat irritably)

I'm not dead yet! And if I die,

there's plenty left to take care of

them.

MURIEL

Not if you cash in your policies.

BILL

I'm sure it won't be necessary. I'll

see the boys at the bank. Maybe you

can put up your insurance as

collateral. If necessary, I'll sign

a personal note.

JIM

(wearily)

Thanks, Bill.

BILL

(paternally)

And Jim, do me a little favor. The

next time you're going to do anything,

or say anything, or buy anything,

think it over very carefully, and

when you're sure you're right --

forget the whole thing. Good night,

Muriel.

MURIEL

Good night, Bill.

MURIEL

What a wonderful friend.

JIM

(darkly)

What's with this kissing all of a

sudden?

MURIEL

What's that?

JIM

Just because a man is helpful in a

business way, it doesn't give him

extra-curricular privileges with my

wife!

MURIEL

That's a fine thing to say about a

friend of fifteen years!

JIM

(testy)

Well, I don't like it. Every time he

goes out of this house, he shakes my

hand and he kisses you.

MURIEL

(sharply)

Would you prefer it the other way

around?!

JIM

(irritably)

Well, I don't like it, that's all!

Why is he always hanging around? Why

doesn't he ever get married -- or

something?

MURIEL

(assumed innocence)

Because he can't find another girl

as sweet and pretty and wholesome as

I am.

JIM

Well -- it -- it doesn't look right.

There are limits to friendship and --

MURIEL

Darling, let's not be silly about

this. It's not Bill, it's the house

you're upset about.

JIM

(sigh)

I suppose so.

JIM

Do you think it's worth all this?

MURIEL

Of course, darling. We're not just

building a house -- it's a home. A

home for ourselves -- and our children --

and maybe our children's children.

JIM

(whimsically)

It's getting awfully crowded with

only three bathrooms.

DISSOLVE

SIMMS

Well -- here are the estimates. Before

you look at them, I think I'd better

explain --

JIM

Don't bother, Simms.

(takes the sheet)

I'm getting to be an old hand at

this sort of --

JIM

Jumping H. Mahogany --!!

SIMMS

Now obviously these bids are way out

of line, that is, all except John

Retch and Son at twenty-one thousand.

MURIEL

(reacting)

Twenty-one thousand!

SIMMS

And with some judicious cutting, I

think we can pare that down to

eighteen.

MURIEL

We've only asked for the barest

necessities --

SIMMS

Frankly, with all the extras you two

have --

JIM

Never mind.

(hands estimates to

Simms)

If you'll just send us a bill for

your services, I'll see that it's

taken care of.

(takes Muriel's hand

and starts for door)

Now, if you'll excuse us.

MURIEL

Where are we going?

JIM

I am going out to get my head

examined! Then, if I don't jump off

the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to

find the owner of our building and

sign a twenty-year lease!

RESIDENCE OF MR. AND MRS. JAMES H. BLANDINGS

JIM

(quietly)

What's the name of that contractor?

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

JOHN W. RETCH AND SON

JIM

(shouting over noise)

Well, things are certainly humming.

BILL

(same)

What's that?

JIM

(same)

I said, humming.

BILL

Oh.

BILL

(loud)

What's going on over there?

JIM

(same)

That's Mr. Tesander. He's digging

our well.

BILL

(same)

Well? What happened to the trout

stream, with that pure, clear, cold

mountain water?

JIM

(same)

I decided against it --

JIM

The trout stream --

(reacts; quietly)

didn't seem practical.

MURIEL

It wasn't exactly a decision, dear.

(to Bill)

We discovered the trout stream dries

up in August and the rest of the

year it's polluted.

JIM

(defensively; groping)

Well, anyway, I'd rather have artesian

water. It's healthier. Calcium --

vitamins -- artesian --

BILL

(indicating)

What's wrong with that steam shovel?

JIM

Better take a look.

MURIEL

Jim!

MURIEL

(sarcastic; to Jim)

Thank you, dear.

JIM

What's the matter, Mr. Zucca?

Something wrong?

ZUCCA

How do you lika that? Broka my bucket.

Two times this week I broka my bucket?

JIM

What did you do, strike a boulder?

ZUCCA

(darkly)

Atsa no boulder, atsa ledge.

JIM

(weakly)

What does that mean?

ZUCCA

Meansa we gotta blast!

JIM

Blast?

ZUCCA

Blast. Witha dynamite.

JIM

What do you mean, dynamite?

MURIEL

(a little annoyed)

What do you mean, "What do you mean?"

Mr. Zucca just explained. He's going

to use dynamite and blast until he

gets rid of the rock.

ZUCCA

Atsa no rock, atsa ledge.

BILL

What Mr. Blandings means is -- what

precisely is a ledge?

ZUCCA

Ledge. Lika bigga stone, only a-

bigger.

JIM

Like a boulder?

ZUCCA

No, like ledge.

BILL

...Like a ledge.

ZUCCA

But you don't gotta worry. Only cost

twenty-four cents a cubic foot, plussa

dynamite an'a fuse.

JIM

But how far will you have to blast?

ZUCCA

Harda tell. Might be a lilla baby

ledge -- mighta run the whole toppa

the mountain.

JIM

(appalled)

At twenty-four cents a foot? Do you

realize what that means?!

ZUCCA

(simply)

Meansa we gotta blast.

JIM

(with quiet resignation)

Well, anyway, our house will never

sink.

MURIEL

(drily)

If it does, we can always get Mr.

Apollonio. He raised the Normandie.

BILL

"Come to peaceful Connecticut --

(another crash)

Trade city soot for sylvan charm."

JIM

(irritably)

How long does that go on?

MURIEL

I don't know.

(to Bill)

Three weeks now at four dollars and

fifty cents a foot.

JIM

(asserting his

authority)

I think I'd better have a little

talk with Mr. Tesander.

JIM

Oh -- Mr. Tesander --

JIM

(louder)

Mr. Tesander!

TESANDER

Yep?

JIM

How's it coming?

TESANDER

(considers a moment;

then:)

It's comin'.

JIM

No -- no -- I mean --

JIM

(shouts)

Mr. Tesander!

TESANDER

Yep?

JIM

What I meant was -- how far down are

you?

TESANDER

Oh -- 'bout a hundred and ninety

feet.

JIM

Well -- isn't that pretty deep?

TESANDER

(thinks it over; he's

not one for snap

judgments; then:)

Yep.

JIM

Do you think maybe you'd better try

another spot?

TESANDER

Up to you.

JIM

I mean -- well, have you hit anything

yet at all?

TESANDER

(thinks it over)

Hit some limestone yesterday.

JIM

Is that good?

TESANDER

That's bad.

TESANDER

And right now it looks like we're

coming into some shale.

JIM

That's bad?

TESANDER

That's good.

JIM

Oh...

TESANDER

'Course it might turn out to be

sandstone.

JIM

That's bad?

JIM

That's good?

TESANDER

Can't tell. Might be good. Might be

bad. One thing you know -- you got

plenty of shale, sandstone and

limestone.

JIM

...I see.

BILL

On a hot day there's nothing like a

nice cool limestone shower.

MURIEL

(sweetly)

Mr. Tesander, just for the record,

of course, what ever happened to

water?

TESANDER

Oh, it's there, all right.

(he smiles, nods,

tips his hat to Muriel)

Just got to be patient.

BILL

If you ask me, this project's getting

a little out of hand.

JIM

(defensively)

Nothing's getting out of hand at

all. I've made a chart of the whole

operation, and --

(indicates Tesander)

with a few minor deviations, I know

exactly what every penny's going to

cost.

MURIEL

Two pennies.

JIM

(coolly)

And just what does that mean?

BILL

(drily)

Meansa we gotta blast.

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

JIM

You see, Mary, the average fellow

who builds a house doesn't know where

he stands from day to day -- but I

do things a little differently. With

a few minor deviations I know exactly

where every penny is going --

BILL

Hi.

JIM

Bill! Come in, come in.

BILL

(entering)

Just going over the Knapp contracts

with old man Dascomb and I -- uh --

(indicates Mary)

Can I talk?

JIM

(a little concerned)

Sure. What's up?

BILL

(obliquely)

While I was in there with Dascomb

the conversation kind of got around

to you and -- uh --

JIM

(impatiently)

What is it?

BILL

Well, he didn't say in so many words

that ever since you started with

that house you haven't turned in a

decent piece of copy, but --

JIM

But you kind of got the feeling...

BILL

...that if I told you, you'd know

that he knew that you knew that he

knew... that you knew... or something.

JIM

What's he worrying about? The

deadline's three months off. I've

always --

MARY

Hello? Yes. Just a minute.

(hands phone to Jim)

Mrs. Blandings calling from Lensdale.

JIM

Yes, Muriel. What? What's that?

Tesander struck water! Say that's

wonderful!

(to Bill)

We've finally got our well.

BILL

(drily)

Congratulations.

JIM

(listens at phone)

Huh? What's that?

(face falls)

What do you mean we've got two wells?

(listens; then, grimly)

I'll be right out.

(hangs up, rises)

Come on, Bill, we'd better get out

to Lansdale.

MARY

Anything wrong?

JIM

(soberly, as he slips

into his coat)

Mary, have you ever seriously

considered building a house?

MARY

Well, no offense, Mr. Blandings, but

my boy friend says that anybody who

builds a house today is crazy.

JIM

You stick with that boy, he's got a

great future.

DISSOLVE

JIM

You mean you hit a spring, a bubbling

spring right here in our cellar?

SIMMS

It'll have to be diverted before

Retch here can lay his cement.

RETCH

(dubiously)

May take a while. Pumps are over in

Jersey.

TESANDER

Tsk, tsk, tsk.

JIM

(mild sarcasm)

Water, Mr. Tesander.

TESANDER

Yep.

JIM

At six feet!

TESANDER

Yep.

JIM

(indicates)

And over there, just thirty-two yards

away, you had to go down two hundred

and twenty-seven feet to hit the

same water.

TESANDER

Yep.

JIM

How do you account for that, Mr.

Tesander?

TESANDER

We-ll, way it seems to me, Mr.

Blandings, over here the water's

down around six feet and over there

it's -- uh --

BILL AND TESANDER

-- down around two hundred and twenty-

seven feet.

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

DISSOLVE

BILL

What's this, another closet?

JIM

This happens to be our dining room.

MURIEL

Not the dining room, dear, the living

room.

(indicates)

There's the fireplace.

JIM

Then where's the dining room?

BILL

Maybe it's that little room off the

hallway.

JIM

That's the breakfast nook.

MURIEL

It's not the breakfast nook, it's

the powder room.

JIM

Oh.

BILL

Do me a favor -- don't ever invite

me here for a meal.

FIRST WORKMAN

I don't figure this Blandings at

all. If you gotta build on the

windiest hill in Connecticut, why do

you have to pick the windiest side

of the hill?

BILL

(to workman)

You know these New York millionaires --

they're eccentric.

JIM

I think I'd like to go outside.

BILL

(gesture to door)

After you, Rockefeller.

CARPENTER

(to Jim)

Just the man I want to see. Would

you step over here a second?

JIM

Sure.

BILL

(indicating)

I'll browse around upstairs.

CARPENTER

(pointing up)

On them second floor lintels between

the lally columns, do you want we

should rabbet them or not?

JIM

(lost)

The -- second -- floor -- lallys?

CARPENTER

The second floor lintels, between

the lallys.

JIM

Oh. Oh, the lintels between the

lallys?

CARPENTER

Yeah. From the blueprints you can't

tell. You want they should be

rabbeted?

JIM

Un -- umm. No, I guess not.

CARPENTER

Okay, you're the doctor.

(calls)

Hey, fellas, you got any of them

rabbeted lintels set, rip 'em out!

JIM

(sheepishly)

It sounded less... expensive to say

no.

MURIEL

Stop it! Stop it!

VOICE

Okay, fellas, let's quit!

JIM

(to Muriel)

Now look what you've done.

JIM

(conciliatory)

Look, men, Mrs. Blandings didn't

mean anything.

(the workmen regard

him curiously)

I mean, there's no point in walking

off a job just because... a woman

makes a silly little remark.

WORKMAN

It's Saturday, mister. We quit at

twelve o'clock. This ain't a chain

gang, you know.

MURIEL

I'm just sick. From the outside this

house looks like a grain elevator,

and on the inside everything's miles

too small.

MURIEL

What's that?

JIM

What's what?

MURIEL

That noise -- listen.

(again the thumping)

It's coming from the closet!

JIM

What happened?

BILL

The door blew shut. I got locked in.

JIM

Impossible. I had this closet built

especially for myself. The lock opens

from the inside.

BILL

Maybe for Houdini -- not for me.

JIM

Nothing to it. A child could work

it. Look, I'll show you.

JIM

(condescendingly)

You see, it just takes a little good

old Yankee know-how.

MURIEL

You know, dear, it's just possible

the lock worked for you and not for

Bill.

JIM

Ridiculous. Even you could do it.

MURIEL

(sarcastic)

Thank you.

JIM

Come on, I'll show you.

JIM'S VOICE

Go ahead, dear, just open it.

MURIEL'S VOICE

I don't seem to be able to ---

JIM'S VOICE

Here, let me show you! You just take

the knob and turn it clockwise.

BILL

Nothing like that good old Yankee

know-how.

JIM

Hey! Hey! Somebody let us out of

here!

MURIEL

Oh, dear.

BILL

(drily)

Leave a call for seven o'clock.

(afterthought)

Monday morning.

JIM

If I could just get over to that

scaffolding...

JIM

(still muttering)

Seems a shame but I guess it's the

only way...

MURIEL

What are you going to do?

JIM

Don't get panicky, I'll get you out

of here.

(hands tar paper to

Bill)

Here, hold this over the window.

JIM

Stand back, Muriel.

JIM

(to Bill)

Ready?

BILL

Roger.

MURIEL

(sweetly)

In case of emergency -- break glass.

Come on, Bill.

JIM

(muttering)

Funny... always worked before. Huh.

I wonder...

mail, starts to thumb

through it)

JOAN

Dad, do you suppose I could have a

chemistry lab in the basement?

JIM

(preoccupied with

mail)

Sure, why not?

BETSY

I think it's awful. Smelling up the

house with those horrible chemicals.

MURIEL

Never mind, Betsy.

(to Jim)

Dear, I'm going up to the place this

afternoon to see about landscaping.

Bill's driving me.

JIM

(preoccupied)

That's nice.

(looking up; darkly)

What do you mean, Bill's driving

you?

MURIEL

(a little annoyed)

Why do you always say, "what do you

mean," when you know perfectly well

what I mean and what you mean?

JIM

I mean that every time I turn my

back Bill Cole's driving you some

place or something.

MURIEL

He's only being helpful.

JIM

(annoyed; tears open

a letter)

I thought he was a lawyer! Why isn't

he out suing somebody?

JOAN

Bicker, bicker, bicker.

MURIEL

(to Joan)

Another word and you don't get your

laboratory.

BETSY

Well, that's something!

JIM

We'll just see about that!

MURIEL

(concerned)

What is it, dear?

MURIEL

Jim, what's the matter?

JIM

(into phone; sharply)

Mr. William Cole, please.

(pause; then with

rising emotion)

Hello, Bill? I want you to fight

this thing! I know my rights as a

citizen! They can't get away with

it!... What do you mean, what am I

talking about? The letter, of course.

From the owner of this building.

They want us to move! It's a thirty

day notice!

(listens a moment)

But that's ridiculous. How can I

move into a house that isn't even

finished?! No windows, no plaster --

or paint, or -- or plumbing!

(listens a moment;

then with rising

emotion)

Now you listen to me! I have no

intention of moving in thirty days!

This is not legal! I'm going to fight

this thing! And I don't care if it

takes every penny I've got!

(listens)

Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... All right!

(hangs up)

MURIEL

(expectantly)

...Well?

JIM

(quietly)

We're moving in thirty days.

DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

So-came thirty days -- and they moved.

BILL'S VOICE

I mean -- we moved.

BILL'S VOICE

(as Jim would say it)

That's the wrong road! Any fool knows

that!

DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

Well, there she is, bright and shining --

and just about complete -- the

residence of Mr. and Mrs. James H.

Blandings.

BILL'S VOICE

Not bad at that.

BILL'S VOICE

(efficient scoutmaster)

All right! -- Everybody out.

BILL'S VOICE

Guess you can't blame them for feeling

just a little bit proud.

BILL'S VOICE

(sentimentally)

Look -- he wants to carry his wife

across the threshold. Romantic, isn't

it?

BILL'S VOICE

Ooops! I guess I meant "corny."

BILL'S VOICE

Uh-uh. Watch that sacroiliac. Fifteen

years since you've done this sort of

thing.

BILL'S VOICE

Whew! Nice work, Tarzan. Now, let's

see if you can make it into the hall.

BILL'S VOICE

That's right. Go right in. Don't pay

any attention to the sign.

WET VARNISH

BILL'S VOICE

(imitating painter)

Don't mind me, buddy, I just got

through varnishing that floor.

BILL'S VOICE

Whose bright idea was this?

BILL'S VOICE

She just wanted everything to be

nice and shiny on the day they moved

in.

BILL'S VOICE

Stop painting that floor and put

some planks down in here, or some

thing!

BILL'S VOICE

Okay, mister, but take it easy. The

Republicans ain't in yet, you know.

BILL'S VOICE

Oh, fine! A house without windows!

We'll just see about that!

BILL'S VOICE

Look out for those papers!

JIM

Where's Simms?

WORKMAN

Around back trying to figure out

what to do about them windows.

JIM

What's the problem? You put windows

up.

WORKMAN

Not these. They don't fit.

JIM

(angrily; control

going)

Oh, they don't, don't they?

RETCH

Oh, Mr. Blandings, you'd better look

these over.

JIM

What's this about the windows?

SIMMS

(calmly)

I'm afraid there's a little slip-up.

These windows seem to belong to a

Mr. Landings in Fishkill, New York.

I talked to Mr. Landings this morning.

JIM

Well, has he got mine?

SIMMS

No, he seems to have some windows

that belong to a Mr. Blandsworth of

Peekskill.

JIM

Where are my windows?!

SIMMS

As near as we can figure out they've

either been sent to a Mr. Benton in

Evanston, Illinois, or a Mr. Bamberger

of Phoenix, Arizona.

JIM

What are we supposed to do -- live

the rest of our lives in a house

without windows?

SIMMS

It'll just be a matter of a few days.

BILL

What's a "Zuz-Zuz Water Soft-N-R"?

JIM

How should I know?

BILL

(indicating)

You've got one.

JIM

(reading from bill)

"Furnishing and installing one Zuz-

Zuz Water Soft-N-R, two hundred and

eighty dollars!"

(explosively)

I will not have any such piece of

equipment in my house!

SIMMS

I'm afraid I authorized that, Mr.

Blandings -- to save your boiler and

water pipes.

JIM

From what?!

SIMMS

Rust. The plumbing man assures us

the water from your well is the most

corrosive in his entire experience

in the trade.

BILL

Another first!

JIM

(pursing his lips)

Mm.

(irritably)

Well, if it's necessary, put it in!

We're moving in today, you know and --

RETCH

It's in.

JIM

Oh.

(a final show of

authority; sharply)

Then get me the bill for it!

BILL

(indicating bill)

You've got it.

JIM

All right then.

DISSOLVE

MURIEL

Now I want the living room to be a

soft green.

(PeDelford nods)

Not quite as bluish as a robin's

egg, but yet not as yellow as daffodil

buds.

PEDELFORD

Mm.

MURIEL

(handing him a sample)

The best sample I could get is a

little too yellow, but don't let

whoever mixes it go to the other

extreme and get it too blue. It should

just be sort of a grayish yellow

green.

PEDELFORD

(making a note)

Mm-hmm.

MURIEL

Now the dining room I'd like yellow.

Not just yellow, a very gay yellow.

PEDELFORD

Mm-hmm.

MURIEL

Something bright and sunshiny.

(sudden inspiration)

I tell you, Mr. PeDelford, if you'll

just send one of your workmen to the

A&P for a pound of their best butter

and match it exactly, you can't go

wrong.

PEDELFORD

(making a note)

Mm.

MURIEL

This is the paper we're going to use

here in the foyer.

(hands sample to him)

It's flowered but I don't want the

ceiling to match any of the colors

of the flowers. There are some little

dots in the background, and it's

these dots I want you to match. Not

the little greenish dots near the

hollyhock leaf, but the little bluish

dot between the rosebud and the

delphinium blossom. Is that clear?

PEDELFORD

(making note)

Mm-hmm.

MURIEL

The kitchen's to be white. Not a

cold, antiseptic hospital white -- a

little warmer but not to suggest any

other color but white.

PEDELFORD

(note)

Mm.

MURIEL

Now for the powder room, I want you

to match this thread.

(hands him thread)

You can see it's practically an apple

red. Somewhere between a healthy

Winesap and an unripened Jonathan.

PEDELFORD

(making note)

Mm.

MURIEL

Will you excuse me?

PEDELFORD

Got it, Charlie?

CHARLIE

rooms with his thumb)

Green, yellow, blue, white, red.

PEDELFORD

Check.

twenty-five minutes.

BILL

Isn't there a later one?

BETSY

Not till the Commuter's Special

tomorrow morning at six-fifteen.

JIM

You mean seven-fifteen.

BETSY

No, Dad, six-fifteen.

JIM

What about the seven-fifteen I'm

supposed to take to the office every

morning?!

BETSY

(consulting timetable)

There's a little asterisk. The seven-

fifteen only runs Saturdays, Sundays

and holidays.

JIM

(taking timetable)

Let me see that!

(scans table,

tightlipped)

Muriel!

MURIEL

Oh, dear, don't tell me I read it

wrong.

JIM

That's fine! For the rest of my life

I'm going to have to get up at five

o'clock in the morning to catch the

six-fifteen, to get to my office by

eight, which doesn't even open until

nine -- and which I never get to

until ten!

MURIEL

Perhaps if you started earlier you

could quit earlier.

JIM

(sharply)

So I could get home earlier to go to

bed earlier to get up earlier!

BILL

Maybe you can have the railroad push

the train up to four-fifteen -- then

you won't have to go to bed at all!

BETSY

Uncle Bill, you're going to miss

your train!

MURIEL

Jim, you clean up this mess. I'll

drive Bill to the station and pick

up some cold cuts for dinner.

BETSY

You'd better hurry!

BILL

closet)

Kind of hate to leave that little

place. Just four walls and a couple

of mothballs, but to me it'll always

be home.

JIM

(preoccupied with

timetable)

So long, Bill.

JOAN

It's certainly going to be fun this

summer when Uncle Bill comes up for

his vacation.

BETSY

We'll get in a lot of doubles.

JIM

Hmm?

(looks up from

timetable)

What are you talking about? Bill's

going to Europe.

BETSY

No, he's not. I heard him and mother

talking. He's going to move his

vacation up and take a place in

Lansdale.

JIM

(vaguely annoyed)

Uh-huh... Mm-hm. Mm-hm... Uh-huh.

(then, covering up)

All right, come on, come on. Get

busy.

DISSOLVE

MURIEL

I'll scout around and find you a

place in Lansdale.

(quickly)

Now, you're not going to change your

mind about coming up?

BILL

Don't worry, I'll be on the job.

MURIEL

It won't be easy. I promise you a

Cook's tour of every lamp maker, rug

weaver, and antique shop in Lansdale

County.

BILL

(philosophically)

When I married you two I suppose I

took you for better or for worse.

MURIEL

Good old Uncle Bill.

BILL

(drily)

Good old Uncle Bill.

DISSOLVE

JIM

Now look what you've done!

BETSY

Father, the first principle of

lighting a fire is to see if the

flue is open. A three-year-old child

knows that.

JIM

Next time we want a fire I'll send

out for a three-year-old child!

Get that stuff cleaned up and go in

and help Gussie set the table. It's

getting late.

JOAN

Look, Dad, your fraternity pins.

JIM

(busy cleaning the

fireplace)

Pins? I only had one.

JOAN

There are two of them here.

JIM

All right, all right. Just put them

Funny, this one says W.C. on the

JIM

Huh?

Let me see that.

What's that?

BETSY

Mother's diary when she was in

college. It's slightly torrid.

JOAN

That's none of your business!

BETSY

To shave.

MURIEL

Tonight??

JIM

While I can still trust myself with

a razor. At six o'clock in the morning

I'd probably cut my throat. Goodnight.

DISSOLVE

MURIEL

Excuse...

MURIEL

Excuse...

JIM

Muriel, do you have to do that now?!

MURIEL

There's no need to be so irritable

just because you have to shave at

night.

JIM

I'm not irritable!

MURIEL

Well, you're certainly something!

You haven't said a civil word all

evening.

JIM

Sometimes a man doesn't feel like

talking.

MURIEL

(solicitously)

What is it, dear? Something down at

the office?

JIM

No.

MURIEL

Have you got the new slogan for

"Wham"?

JIM

It's not due yet!

MURIEL

Well, it's something. You're certainly

upset about something. I can always

tell.

JIM

I'm not upset.

(going back to shaving;

with studied unconcern)

It's just that I don't happen to

approve of falsehood and deception.

Particularly in my own wife.

MURIEL

What are you talking about?

JIM

(same)

Oh, nothing. It's just that I

distinctly remember your telling me

you gave back Bill's fraternity pin

fifteen years ago.

JIM

Well, did you or didn't you?

MURIEL

Did I, or didn't I what?

JIM

Give it back to him.

MURIEL

Of course I did. If I said I did, I

did.

JIM

(suddenly Sam Spade)

Then perhaps you'd have the goodness

to explain how this happened to fall

out of your jewel box?

JIM

What's so funny?

MURIEL

You! You're jealous! You're standing

there with your face full of soap

and you're jealous.

JIM

(angrily)

If you were so crazy about the guy,

why didn't you marry him?!

MURIEL

(beginning to be a

little angry)

Because I wasn't in love with him!

JIM

(vindictively)

That's not what you said in your

diary!

MURIEL

(now really angry)

Oh, now you've been reading my diary!

JIM

(a little guilty)

Well -- it happened to fall open

and... I... happened to look at it.

It... just happened.

MURIEL

I'll just bet!

JIM

It's all over the book so why don't

you admit it? You were in love with

Bill Cole!

MURIEL

Don't be absurd! Of course I was in

love with Bill. In those days I was

in love with a new man every week.

JIM

Then why did you marry me?

MURIEL

I'm beginning to wonder!

(exploding)

Maybe it was those big cow eyes of

yours or that ridiculous hole in

your chin! Maybe I knew that some

day you'd bring me out to this thirty-

eight thousand dollar icebox with a

dried-up trout stream and no windows!

Or maybe I just happened to fall in

love with you -- but for heaven's

sake, don't ask me why!

JIM

(tentatively)

...Muriel?

JIM

...Honey?

JIM

Would it do any good to say I'm sorry?

MURIEL

I don't know.

JIM

Well -- I am. I acted like a schoolboy

and I'm sorry.

MURIEL

Oh, Jim!

MURIEL

(dreamily)

Why don't you take the soap out of

your ears?

JIM

(same)

Why do I love you so much?

MURIEL

(breathless)

Darling, it's awfully late.

MURIEL

(same)

Maybe you ought to go down and lock

the doors.

JIM

(kissing her ear)

What for? The windows are all open

anyway.

MURIEL

(as he starts to kiss

her again)

Jim, you have to get up at six

o'clock.

JIM

(considers; logic

prevails; brief sigh)

Yes, I guess so.

MURIEL

(reluctantly)

Goodnight, dear.

JIM

(same)

Goodnight.

DISSOLVE

BILL'S VOICE

And so the days sped by -- and the

bills -- and the extras -- and as

the house approached forty thousand

dollars, Jim approached his deadline

for the new slogan. It was almost a

photo finish.

DISSOLVE

JIM

You'd better send out for coffee and

sandwiches,... It looks like an all

night session.

MARY

(concerned)

What did he say?

JIM

(wearily, seating

himself at desk)

Tomorrow morning.

MARY

(sighs)

Well, I guess you'll just have to

dream something up -- good or bad.

JIM

I rather got the impression it had

better be good.

MARY

(raised eyebrow)

Oh.

JIM

(ruminatively, almost

to himself)

Funny how you look forward to the

little things. Rain, for instance.

JIM

For a month now, I guess I've been

looking forward to the first rainy

night at the house.

(looks at Muriel's

picture)

Big blazing fire. Muriel knitting.

Me in my new smoking jacket... with

my pipe and slippers, reading my

paper...

(sighs)

Oh, well.

DISSOLVE

MURIEL

(with relief)

Thank heavens! The children.

BILL

(rising)

Stay put. You look too comfortable.

MR. JONES

Whew! What a night! I'm Jones, from

down the road. Just came over to

tell you your kids are all right,

Mr. Blandings.

BILL

Oh, I'm not Mr. Blandings. Cole's

the name, Bill Cole.

BILL

Friend of the family. Wet clothes.

Just came in out of the rain.

MURIEL

I'm Mrs. Blandings.

JONES

How do. Mrs. Williams just called.

Says your phone's out of order. Wanted

me to tell you the water's rising

and they've got the bridge roped

off. Girls'll spend the night over

at her place.

MURIEL

Thank you. I was beginning to get

concerned. Can I make you a cup of

tea?

JONES

No, thanks. Better be gettin' back

'fore I have to swim for it. 'Night,

Mrs. Blandings.

(to Bill)

'Night, Mr. Bl--

BILL

(weak smile)

Cole. Bill Cole. Friend of the family.

Just came in out of the rain.

JONES

(uncertainly)

Well -- 'Night.

MURIEL

Goodnight... and thanks so much.

BILL

That's fine. No bridge. How do I get

back to Lansdale?

MURIEL

(simply)

You'll just have to spend the night

right here.

BILL

Muriel, really! With your husband in

New York and your children away --

think of my reputation.

MURIEL

(smile)

Don't worry, Snow White, you'll be

as pure and unsullied in the morning

as you were the night before.

BILL

(with resignation)

That's the story of my life.

MURIEL

Poor Jim, he sounded so worried

before. I certainly hope he comes up

with something.

BILL

Don't worry about the man who gave

the world "When you've got the whim,

say Wham!"-- This well will never

run dry.

SLOW DISSOLVE

JIM

(selling; a note of

desperation in his

voice)

"Compare the price, compare the slice,

Take our advice -- Buy Wham!"

JIM

"If you'd buy better ham. You'd better

buy Wham!"

MARY

It's Boyle Petroleum. "If you'd buy

better oil, You'd better buy Boyle."

JIM

"This little pig went to market As

meek and as mild as a lamb. He smiled

in his tracks When they slipped him

the axe He knew he'd turn out to be

Wham!"

JIM

(quietly)

"...knew he'd turn out to be Wham!"

JIM

(rising panic)

It's gone! I've lost my touch! Maybe

I never had a touch! Maybe "Whim Say

Wham" was an accident! Who knows? I

can't think any more! All I've got

on my mind is a house with an eighteen

thousand dollar mortgage, and bills,

and extras, and antiques, and -- and --

(dejected)

I don't know... I don't know.

MARY

(startled)

Where are you going?

JIM

Home, to get some sleep -- and I'd

advise you to do the same.

MARY

But -- but you haven't --

JIM

Suppose I haven't! This isn't the

only job in town!

MARY

But -- but -- what'll I tell Mr.

Dascomb?

JIM

(sharply)

You just tell him to -- to --

(with finality)

You just tell him!

DISSOLVE

JIM

'Morning, dear.

MURIEL

(going to him;

solicitously)

Darling, you must be exhausted. How

did it go?

JIM

Fine. Fine.

MURIEL

(obliquely)

Is... everything all right?

JIM

(unenthusiastic)

Everything's fine.

(still in embrace;

looking up)

Hello, Simms, what brings you out

with the morning dew?

SIMMS

Just dropped by to check the

blueprints. Some extras came in from

Retch this morning and there're a

couple of things I thought we ought

to go over together.

JIM

(arms still around

Muriel; unconcerned)

Really. What are they?

SIMMS

Well, let's see.

(thumbing through

sheets)

Few little things here, all right, I

guess. "Mortising five butts -- a

dollar sixty-eight."

JIM

Let's not quibble about that. A man's

entitled to mortise a few butts now

and then.

SIMMS

(next sheet)

Extra nails and screws -- three

dollars, eighty-nine cents.

JIM

Petty larceny, but let him get away

with it.

SIMMS

Now there's one here I frankly don't

understand. Ah, here we are.

(reads)

"Changes in closet, twelve hundred

and forty-seven dollars." Did you

authorize that?

JIM

Well, we probably told him to --

(reacting)

Twelve hundred and what?!

SIMMS

Forty-seven dollars. Changes in

closet.

(hands bill to Jim)

JIM

(explosively)

Who does he think we are!

(looks at bill; very

businesslike)

What's this notation: "Refer to Detail

Sheet Number one thirty-five?"

SIMMS

(indicating blueprints)

Far as I remember, that would be

something in the back of the house.

Let's just take a look.

SIMMS

Ah, here we are. It isn't a closet

at all. It's off the back pantry...

Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink.

JIM

Oh... Mrs. Blandings' little flower

sink.

SIMMS

(to Muriel)

You didn't authorize any changes,

did you?

MURIEL

(defensively)

Well... they certainly weren't

changes.

JIM

What -- have -- you -- done?

MURIEL

(speaking rapidly a

little confused)

I haven't done anything! And what I

did was... just nothing at all.

JIM

What -- have -- you -- done?!

MURIEL

Well --

(rattling off)

All I did was one day I saw four

pieces of flagstone left over from

the porch that were just going to be

thrown away because nobody wanted

them and I asked Mr. Retch if he

wouldn't just put them down on the

floor of the flower sink and poke a

little cement between the cracks and

give me a nice stone floor where it

might be wet with flowers and things.

That was absolutely all I did.

JIM

That's all you did?

MURIEL

Absolutely. Just four little pieces

of flagstone.

SIMMS

(to Muriel; wearily)

Did you by any chance authorize a

drain?

MURIEL

(verge of tears)

Of course I didn't. All I said was I

wanted a nice stone floor and Mr.

Retch was just as nice as could be

and said, "You're the doctor," and

that's all anybody ever said to

anybody about anything.

JIM

...Well?

SIMMS

(sigh; plunging in)

All right, I think I can tell you

what happened. First, the carpenters

had to rip up the flooring that was

already laid. Those planks run under

the whole width of the pantry, so

Retch had to knock the bottom out of

the pantry wall to get at them.

SIMMS' VOICE

Then he had to chop out the tops of

the joists under the flower sink

space to make room for a cradle. I

guess he bought some iron straps and

fastened them to a big pan to give

him something to hold the cement.

What with that added load on the

weakened joists, I'll bet he had to

put a lally column down there for

support, too.

MURIEL

It was just four little pieces of

flagstone, and I only ---

JIM

Quiet!

SIMMS

Well, the main soil pipe runs under

there on wall brackets, so Retch had

to get his plumbing man back to take

out a section so he could get that

cradle set. I guess that meant he

had to change the pitch of the soil

pipe from one end of the house to

the other.

(looks up)

'Morning, Mr. Cole.

BILL

'Morning. Hello, Jim.

JIM

(turning)

Hello, Bill.

MURIEL

(lamely)

The bridge was roped off and Bill

had to stay last night.

JIM

...Oh.

BILL

(cheerily)

Slept like a rock.

JIM

I'm delighted.

SIMMS

(clearing his throat)

And then, of course, there are hot

and cold water pipes hooked to the

joists right under that pantry. They

go up to the wing bathroom on the

second floor, and I'll bet my bottom

dollar he had to relocate them.

SIMMS' VOICE

And I guess the electrician had to

rip out about sixty feet of armored

cable between the main panel and the

junction box by the oil burner,

including the two hundred twenty

volt cable that goes to the stove.

GUSSIE

'Morning, everybody. Whew! What a

night!

JIM

Where have you been?

GUSSIE

Lansdale. Couldn't get back across

the bridge.

JIM

You... weren't here last night?

GUSSIE

They weren't letting anybody across

that bridge, Mr. Blandings.

(to Muriel)

I passed the girls over at the

Williams. They'll be along any minute.

MURIEL

(quickly)

Thank you, Gussie. You'd better get

breakfast started.

MURIEL

Where were we?

BILL

We were at the two hundred twenty

volt cable that goes to the stove.

JIM

Just a minute.

(looks at Bill, then

at Muriel)

You mean the children weren't here

last night either?

MURIEL

How could they be, dear? The bridge

was closed.

JIM

I just came across it.

MURIEL

Well, it was closed last night.

JIM

(pointedly)

It's open now!

BILL

(attempt at breeziness)

If you'll all excuse me -- I -- I

think I'll just go up and slip into

something a little more comfortable.

SIMMS

(rapidly)

Well, that's about the size of it --

SIMMS

-- except that Retch had to repair

the pantry wall and that meant getting

a plasterer back. And of course, he

couldn't have broken through that

wall --

JIM

All right, Simms, all right. We'll

take care of it.

SIMMS

(preparing to exit)

I'll admit it's a little steep. But

I'll try to get Retch to knock a

hundred dollars off the bill. If I

can't get that, I'll certainly try

for seventy-five.

JIM

Fine.

SIMMS

If he doesn't go for seventy-five,

I'll take a stab at fifty.

JIM

You do that.

SIMMS

(at the door)

Anyway, I'm almost sure we can get

twenty-five.

SIMMS

(lamely)

Well. Good day.

MURIEL

(carefully)

Now dear, you're upset, you've got a

lot of things on your mind --

JIM

(with dangerous calm)

Muriel, there's only one thing on my

mind -- This house -- and how fast

we can get rid of it!

MURIEL

That's not what you're thinking.

JIM

Maybe it's not. Maybe I'm thinking I

was once a happy man!

(the martyr)

I didn't have a closet, I didn't

have three bathrooms, but I did have

my sanity, a few dollars in the bank,

two children who loved me and a wife

I could trust!

MURIEL

That's a fine thing to say!

JIM

I also had a job at Danton and

Bascomb, something I don't happen to

have at the moment!

MURIEL

Jim!

JIM

That's right, I've resigned! We're

starting all over again! From scratch!

And without this house!

MURIEL

(near tears)

You love this house!

JIM

I hate it!

MURIEL

You don't mean that.

JIM

Every word of it! Anybody who builds

a house today is crazy! The minute

you start, they put you on the list.

The All-American Sucker list!

Everywhere you turn they've got a

hand in your pocket. If you take out

their hands, they find more pockets!

(explosively)

It's a conspiracy, I tell you, a

conspiracy against every man and

woman who want a home of their own!

Against every boy and girl who were

ever in love!

JIM

(sharply)

What do you want?!

TESANDER

(shyly)

Well, Mr. Blandings, there's a matter

of twelve dollars and eighty-six

cents.

JIM

(with a wild gleam)

Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents!

Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander?

(emptying pockets)

Take everything I've got! Spread it

out among your pals!

(advancing toward the

bewildered Tesander)

Wouldn't Retch like a little

something? Maybe Zucca could use my

new dinner jacket? It's open house,

Mr. Tesander! Help yourself! If this

isn't enough I'll come over to your

place and do some odd chores. Maybe

I can mow your lawn or scratch your

back!

TESANDER

(simply)

You don't understand, Mr. Blandings.

This twelve dollars and eighty-six

cents -- you don't owe me, I owe

you.

JIM

...W-what was that?

TESANDER

(taking out money)

Found I overcharged you. Almost three

feet.

TESANDER

Better count it. I think it's all

there.

MURIEL

Thank you very much, Mr. Tesander.

TESANDER

Well, I guess I'd better be gettin'

along.

(looking around)

Sure got a pretty place here.

(at door; pauses;

looks back)

I'll tell Mr. Zucca about the dinner

jacket.

BILL

Oh, Mr. Tesander -- could you give

me a lift to town?

TESANDER

Yep.

BILL

Be right with you.

MURIEL

(concerned)

What did you mean before about losing

your job? Will we really have to

sell the house?

JIM

(miserable)

I don't know, dear... I don't know.

BILL

In case anyone's interested, I'm

leaving for town.

(for Jim's benefit)

If you want to count the silverware,

I'll wait.

JIM

(sheepishly)

Bill, be patient with me. Maybe one

of these days I'll grow up.

BILL

(to Muriel)

What happened to him?

MURIEL

Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents.

BILL

Mind if I say something?

BILL

You know, I've kind of been the voice

of doom about this whole project.

Every step of the way I was firmly

convinced you were getting fleeced,

bilked, rooked, flimflammed and

generally taken to the cleaners. And

maybe you were. Maybe it cost you a

whole lot more than you thought it

would. Maybe there were times when

you wished you'd never started the

whole thing. But when I look around

and see what you two have here -- I

don't know.

(pause)

Maybe there are some things you should

buy with your heart and not with

your head. Maybe those are the things

that really count... See you around.

BETSY

'Morning, everybody!

JOAN

(surprised)

Hi, Dad! How come you're not at the

office?

JIM

(a look at Muriel)

I'm on a... kind of a vacation.

JOAN

You mean you got fired?

JIM

Well, not exactly, I --

MURIEL

We'll discuss it later.

GUSSIE

(brightly)

Come and get it! Breakfast everybody.

BETSY

Good! I'm starving! What are we

having, Gussie?

GUSSIE

Orange juice, scrambled eggs and you-

know-what.

JOAN

(making a face)

Ham?

GUSSIE

Not ham -- Wham!

If you ain't eatin' Wham, you ain't

What did she say?

JIM

Darling, give Gussie a ten dollar

raise!
