CREDITS

Credits roll, in white letters, on several funny cartoons, all of

them about witches and witchcraft (a caldron over a fire, with two

witches on either side of it - A close-up of one of the witches -

A witches falling down from the sky on her broomstick, and loosing

her hat in the fall - A furious black cat spitting at an owl

seated on a branch - A carafe with two glasses, actually a direct

reference to the film - An Halloween pumpkin pressing her two

forefingers in its ears, with music notes around it - Black bats

flying over a village).

BROOKLYN - GENERAL OVERVIEW - EXTERIOR DAY

A general overview of Brooklyn, near New York, seen from the roof

of a very high building. Written in white letters on this

overview, the following words :

This is a Hallowe'en

tale of Brooklyn, where

anything can happen--

and it usually does.

Then :

At 3 P.M. on this

particular day, this

was happening-

Several white circles move on the screen, then the whole screen is

covered by a huge base ball, with Brooklyn written on it in

black letters.

BASEBALL GAME - SPECTATORS - EXTERIOR DAY

Close-up of the face of man, screaming :

BASEBALL FAN

I'll knock your block off, you big stiff ! You're a bum !

The camera moves away, so we can see the other baseball spectators

behind the first one.

BASEBALL FIELD - EXTERIOR DAY

General view of a baseball field, where a game is being played.

Follow several very quick sequences (one or two seconds each) : A

general view of the spectators. Then a player throwing a ball.

Then a very excited brass band playing. Then a few very excited

spectators. Then another player throwing a ball.

Finally we see a batter missing his ball. We hear the Umpire,

standing behind the catcher and heavily covered with a protection

suit, yelling :

THE UMPIRE

Strike ! You're out !

The batter, who missed the ball, drops his bat on the ground and

comes back to the Umpire. He tears the Umpire helmet and mask

away, and gives him a good punch in the nose. The Umpire falls on

the ground. The catcher then hits the batter. The Umpire rises

slowly from the ground.

Several very quick sequences : The ball-thrower drops his glove

and runs to the fight. Then several excited spectators stand up to

join the fight. Several player, who were waiting for their turn to

go on the field, also run to the fight. Then a view of the fight,

where all the players are hitting each other. Then the popcorn

seller, dropping his basket to join the fight. Then spectators

jumping over the balustrades to join the fight. Then another view

of the players fighting. Then a final view of the Umpire, laying

on the field and leaning on one elbow, and quietly munching some

food.

NEW YORK - A BRIDGE - EXTERIOR DAY

We see a large view of a bridge with a white boat passing

underneath. Written in large white letters on the screen, the

words :

While at the same time

across the river in the

UNITED STATE PROPER

there was a romance in

the air.

AN EXCITED GIRL VOICE

Elmer, here it is.

A MORE QUIET MALE VOICE

I knew you'd find it.

ANOTHER MALE VOICE

Boy, I could sure use a drink.

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

I wonder if any big shots are getting married today ?

THE OTHER JOURNALIST

Looks like the same suckers get married every day.

THE OTHER JOURNALIST

Come on.

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Hey, the guy with the cheaters.

THE OTHER JOURNALIST

Now what's he hiding from ?

THE OTHER JOURNALIST

Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster?

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic ?

THE OTHER JOURNALIST

No, it's not him. But what a scoop it would be ! The guy

who wrote The Bachelor's Bible finally getting hooked

himself. Nope. It's too good to be true. Come on, let's

snap the mayor in his new fire helmet and go home.

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Hey, let's stick around, and see who the guy is.

THE CLERK

"Two by two they come and go. Hip hip hig hay !"

THE CLERK

Good morning, children. Your name, please ?

ELAINE

Elaine Harper.

THE CLERK

Speak a little louder.

ELAINE

Elaine Harper.

THE CLERK

Thank you. Yours ?

MORTIMER

Mortimer Brewster.

THE CLERK

How's that ?

MORTIMER

Mortimer Brewster.

THE CLERK

Speak up, sonny. There's nothing to be afraid of.

MORTIMER

I want to keep this undercover.

THE CLERK

Love her ? But of course you love her. You're going to

marry her, aren't you ?

MORTIMER

No-no, you don't understand. Come here, come.

MORTIMER

You see, I don't want this to get out for a while. I'm

Mortimer Brewster.

THE CLERK

You're who ?

MORTIMER

Mortimer Brew...

THE OTHER JOURNALIST

That's him !

THE OTHER JOURNALIST

(voice over)

Mister Brewster !

THE OTHER JOURNALIST

Oh, Mister Brewster !

THE MAN ON THE PHONE

Now, look...

MORTIMER

Goodbye, dear.

MORTIMER

Don't you understand ? How can I marry you ? Me, the symbol

of bachelorhood. I've sneered at every love scene in every

play. I've written four million words against marriage !

Not only hooked, but to a minister's daughter, and not only

a minister's daughter but a girl from Brooklyn. And look at

the way you look ! What is that sort of contraption you've

got there ?

ELAINE

That's a pin I borrowed from your aunts. You know what

they're saying, "Something borrowed..."

MORTIMER

Yeah, I know that "Something borrowed, something blue."

Old, new. Rice and old shoes. Carry you over the threshold.

Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe I made fun for years.

Is this what I've come to ? I can't go through with it. I

won't marry you. And that's that.

ELAINE

Yes, Mortimer.

MORTIMER

What do you mean, Yes, Mortimer ? Aren't you insulted ?

Aren't you going to cry ? Aren't you going to make a

scene ?

ELAINE

No, Mortimer.

MORTIMER

And don't No, Mortimer me, either ! Don't you see

marriage is a superstition. It's old-fashioned. It's...

a... a... Ohh !...

And now, back to

one of Brooklyn's most

charming residential

districts--

--From her in you're

on your own.

BROPHY

O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't seem to realize. I'm

turning over to you the nicest, the best beat in Brooklyn.

Now look at that old church. And them old houses.

O'HARA

Did George Washington ever do any sleeping around here ?

BROPHY

Of course he did. Well, this whole neighborhood just stinks

with atmosphere. And look at that old house there.

O'HARA

Are the original owners still over there ?

BROPHY

Now, don't crack wise about the Brewster sisters. They're

two of the dearest, sweetest, kindest old ladies that ever

walked the earth. They're out of this world. They're

like... they're like pressed rose leaves.

O'HARA

Pressed rose leaves ?

O'HARA

The old girls must be kind of hard up, huh ?

BROPHY

No, no. Their old man left them fixed for life. And don't

you call them the girls, either.

BROPHY

Brophy. Is Lieutenant around ?

O'HARA

Then, so why here do they rent a room for ?

BROPHY

They don't rent rooms. But you can bet if anybody came

looking for a room, they wouldn't go away without a good

meal and probably a couple of bucks in their pockets.

That's just their way of digging up people to do good to.

ABBY

Reverend Harper, I do hope you don't disapprove of Mortimer

just because he's a dramatic critic and takes your daughter

to the theater every night.

REVEREND HARPER

It's not so much that I disapprove of his being a critic,

but no man, no man with this published attitude on

marriage...

REVEREND HARPER

...should take any man's daughter anyplace...

REVEREND HARPER

...at any time.

TEDDY

I must be catching cold.

ABBY

(to Teddy)

No, dear. It was Reverend Harper who sneezed.

(to Reverend Harper)

Bless you.

ABBY

We mustn't be angry with Mortimer. He's so very much in

love with her. And Sister Martha and I are so happy about

it. He used to come to see us only occasionally, and now,

now he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.

BROPHY

Remember now, watch your language.

O'HARA

Besides, you know I'm not a swearing man.

BROPHY

You'd be surprised what they'd consider swearing.

ABBY

Oh, will you excuse me ?

ABBY

No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go.

ABBY

Oh, come right in, Mr. Brophy.

BROPHY

Miss Abby, we came for the toys.

ABBY

Oh yes.

BROPHY

This is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over my beat.

O'HARA

How are you doing ?

ABBY

May I welcome you to our neighborhood, Mister O'Hara.

TEDDY

Gentlemen, what news have you brought me ?

BROPHY

Colonel, we have nothing to report.

O'HARA

Huh ?

O'HARA

Oh no, absolutely nothing to report.

TEDDY

Splendid ! Thank you, gentlemen.

(very serious again)

At ease.

ABBY

You know the Reverend Doctor Harper from the church next

door ?

BROPHY

Hello, Reverend. This is Officer O'Hara, the new man on the

beat.

O'HARA

How do you do, sir ? It's nice to meet you.

ABBY

The toys are on the chair up here, by the library door.

ABBY

Oh, Teddy, will you run upstairs and bring down your Army

and Navy from Aunt Martha's room. They're all packed.

REVEREND HARPER

That's splendid work you men do, fixing up discarded toys

for the kids at camp.

TEDDY

Charge !

BROPHY

It gives us something to do as we are sitting around the

station. You get tired of playing cards.

BROPHY

So these are the toys ?

ABBY

How's Missis Brophy ?

BROPHY

Oh, she's better, thank you. But a little weak, still.

ABBY

Well, I'll better get some beef broth for you to take to

her.

BROPHY

Oh, Miss Abby, please don't bother. You've done so much

already.

ABBY

Oh, Stuff and nonsense ! I won't be a minute.

REVEREND HARPER

Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness and absolute

generosity are, it's because I've known the Brewster

sisters.

BROPHY

Oh, Teddy, you promised me you wouldn't do that anymore.

TEDDY

But I have to call a Cabinet meeting to get the release of

those supplies.

BROPHY

Now don't do that again. Do you hear me ?

BROPHY

He used to do that in the middle of the night, and

neighbors raised Cain with me. They're a little afraid of

him anyway.

O'HARA

Look, Sarge, I promised you I wouldn't swear, but what the

heck...

O'HARA

...What's going on here anyway ?

REVEREND HARPER

Oh, he's quite harmless.

BROPHY

He thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt. So what, there's a lot of

worse guys he could think he was.

O'HARA

Huh ?

O'HARA

That's right. I'll make a note of it. He's a very

interesting character.

BROPHY

Isn't it a shame, Father, isn't it a shame, Reverend, that

a nice family like this should be hatching a cuckoo ?

MARTHA

Oh, well, now, isn't this nice !

BROPHY

Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.

MARTHA

How do you do, Mr Brophy ?

REVEREND HARPER

Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.

MARTHA

Reverend Harper, how do you do ?

BROPHY

Oh, Miss Martha, this is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over

my duties.

O'HARA

How do you do, ma'am ?

MARTHA

I'm very glad to know you.

O'HARA

Thank you.

ABBY

Oh, Martha, you're back.

ABBY

Here's the broth for Missis Brophy. Be sure it's good and

hot.

BROPHY

You bet I will, and thank you very much.

TEDDY

The Army and Navy are ready for action.

BROPHY

Oh, Colonel, this is grand. It'll make a lot of kids happy.

TEDDY

What's this ? The Oregon ?

MARTHA

Oh, Teddy, dear, put it back.

TEDDY

But the Oregon goes to Australia.

ABBY

Now, Teddy...

TEDDY

No, it goes to Australia.

BROPHY

These are lovely. Thank you very much.

ABBY

Not at all.

BROPHY

The children will go crazy.

ABBY

Oh, now, don't mention it.

O'HARA

Well... So long, Colonel.

O'HARA

Hey, Sarge.

BROPHY

Hey ?

BROPHY

Oh, yes.

TEDDY

Dismissed !

BROPHY

Well, goodbye and thank you.

ABBY

Good bye.

ABBY

Careful of the step here now with the toys.

BROPHY

Good night.

TEDDY

Young man, let that be a lesson to you.

ABBY

Goodbye.

ABBY

Well...

REVEREND HARPER

Well, I must be going.

TEDDY

Charge !

TEDDY

Charge the blockhouse !

REVEREND HARPER

Blockhouse ?

MARTHA

Oh, the stairs are always San Juan Hill.

REVEREND HARPER

Oh, I...

ABBY

Bless you !

REVEREND HARPER

Have you ever tried to persuade him he wasn't Teddy

Roosevelt ?

ABBY

Oh, no !

MARTHA

Oh, he's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt.

ABBY

Oh, do you remember, Martha ?

ABBY

Once, a long time ago, we thought if he'd be George

Washington, it might be a change for him, and we suggested

it.

MARTHA

And do you know what happened ? He just stayed under his

bed for days and wouldn't be anybody.

REVEREND HARPER

Well, if he's happy, and what's more important, you're

happy...

MARTHA

Oh, our only worry for Teddy is after we are gone.

REVEREND HARPER

Yes, indeed. That is quite a problem.

ABBY

But Mortimer's made all the arrangements for Teddy to go to

Happy Dale Sanitarium after we pass on.

REVEREND HARPER

Splendid idea ! A very pleasant place.

MARTHA

Yes...

ABBY

Dear, sweet Reverend Harper.

ABBY

You know, Martha, I really do believe he's beginning to see

the light.

MARTHA

I'm sure we needn't worry about him. He won't interfere

with our plans for Mortimer and Elaine.

MARTHA

Oh, did you just have tea ?

ABBY

Yes. And dinner's going to be late, too.

MARTHA

Ohh ! Why ?

ABBY

Teddy ?...

ABBY

Oh, Teddy, good news for you. You're going to Panama and

dig another lock for the canal.

TEDDY

Delighted !

TEDDY

That's bully ! Just bully ! I shall prepare at once for the

journey.

TEDDY

Charge !

MARTHA

Abby ! While I was out ?

ABBY

Yes, dear. I just couldn't wait for you. I didn't know when

you'd be back, and Reverend Harper was coming.

MARTHA

But all by yourself.

ABBY

Oh, I got along fine.

MARTHA

I'll run right downstairs and see.

ABBY

No, no, dear. There wasn't time. And I was all alone.

MARTHA

Well ?

ABBY

Martha, just look in the window-seat.

ABBY

Oh ! It's Elaine !

ELAINE

You, darlings.

MARTHA

But, Elaine !

ABBY

What did she mean ? You don't suppose they've gone and...

MORTIMER

Elaine !

CAB DRIVER

Listen, buddy. This old cab has seen osculation but...

MORTIMER

You ain't seen anything yet. You've got to drive us to the

station.

CAB DRIVER

You'd better take her hat.

MORTIMER

Oh thanks.

CAB DRIVER

Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a... And her brooch.

MORTIMER

If you find her hairpins, you can keep them. Hold on to

that.

CAB DRIVER

Yeah !

MARTHA

There they are.

MORTIMER

Here's your hat.

ELAINE

Just throw it. I don't like that look in your eyes.

MORTIMER

What ? What's the matter ?

ELAINE

Father preached in sermon about it only last Sunday.

MORTIMER

He did ? He did ? What did he say ? What did he say ?

ELAINE

He was against it.

MORTIMER

Ah ! But that was only Sunday.

MORTIMER

Please ! For heaven's sake !

ELAINE

But, Mortimer, right out here in the open with everyone

looking ?

MORTIMER

Yeah ! Right out here in the open with everyone looking.

Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look.

ELAINE

But, Mortimer, you're going to love me for my mind, too ?

MORTIMER

One thing at a time.

ELAINE

Oh ! There's that look again !

MORTIMER

There's that look again, Mortimer ! You better get used

to it.

MORTIMER

Look like you're going to see it often. It goes just before

this.

MORTIMER

You know what we're doing, darling ? We're wasting time.

Look, I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your old... No,

you'd better not tell your father just yet. You'll run that

cold of his into a pneumonia.

ELAINE

Oh, I can handle Father. He's a dear.

MORTIMER

Look, why don't we wire him from Niagara Falls ?

ELAINE

Niagara Falls ?

ELAINE

Then that's why you stopped at your office.

MORTIMER

Yes, certainly ! We're going to go the whole hog. Niagara

Falls ! Everybody ought to go to Niagara Falls. You

should've seen my secretary's face when I made the

reservation. We've got a drawing-room on the train,

the bridal suite in the hotel, and tomorrow morning

we go over the falls in a barrel.

MORTIMER

Go on, darling, hurry and pack.

ELAINE

I don't have to. I started packing the day after I met you.

MORTIMER

There, you see ! You see ? That's what I mean. That's what

I hate about women.

CAB DRIVER

I wonder what Mary's doing now ?

MORTIMER

Go on, darling, the train leaves in an hour, and hurry.

ELAINE

It'll be a few minutes before I'm ready. Father may want to

pray over me a little.

MORTIMER

Whistle when you're ready. Oh, Elaine...

ELAINE

Yeah.

MORTIMER

When you whistle, open the front door fast. If you see a

tall, dark streak of light, it's me.

MORTIMER

What ? Now ?

ELAINE

No, not now !

MARTHA

Look surprised when he tells us.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha !

MORTIMER

Hold on to your bustles. We're married. Elaine and I are

married.

ABBY

Oh, darling, how wonderful ! Oh, Martha, isn't it

wonderful ? They're married!

MORTIMER

Yeah ! Don't pretend to be so surprised either, you two old

frauds. Can I use the telephone, darling ?

ABBY

Yes, of course.

ABBY

Isn't it too, too wonderful ?

MARTHA

And to think that it happened right here in this room !

MORTIMER

Oh, now, here, here, now ! Hello ?... Hello ? Benson's

Florists ? This is Mortimer Brewster. Did you send those

roses to Missis Brewster's apartment ?... You did ? Good.

Now, send four dozen more to drawing room A, Canadian

Limited, Grand Central Station. Yes... And hurry then. And

throw in a flock of orange blossoms.

ABBY

But before you go, we can have our celebration. I'll open a

bottle of wine and we'll sing. And we'll invite a few of

the neighbors in.

MARTHA

And, of course, a wedding cake.

MORTIMER

Oh, darling, you won't have time to bake a cake. We're

going to Niagara Falls. I've got a taxi waiting.

ABBY

Oh, it's all ready. It's been ready since..

MORTIMER

Yeah, I bet it's been ready since the first day I met her,

huh ?

MORTIMER

What is it ? Did everybody in Brooklyn know I was getting

married, except me ?

MARTHA

Oh, we knew you'd find out about it in time.

MORTIMER

Come here. I've got the two nicest aunts in the world. Of

course, you've got the nicest nephew in the world, too.

MARTHA

Well, I'll run along and get everything ready.

ABBY

Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend isn't too angry. You know

how your books upset him.

MORTIMER

Well, I'm going to burn all my books. And I'll let the

Reverend Harper light the first match. Oh, by the way, did

I leave some notes here for my new book ?

ABBY

You mean Mind Over Matrimony ?

MORTIMER

Yes ! Shhh ! Where are they ?

ABBY

I hid them someplace...

MORTIMER

Come on, come on. Let's go.

ABBY

Now you behave.

MORTIMER

Let's find them before Elaine sees them.

TEDDY

Hello, Mortimer !

MORTIMER

How are you, Mister President ?

TEDDY

Bully, thank you. Just bully. What news have you brought

me ?

MORTIMER

Just this, Mister President. The country's squarely behind

you.

TEDDY

Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful ?

TEDDY

Well, goodbye. I'm off to Panama.

MORTIMER

Goodbye, Mister President.

TEDDY

A new lock for the canal, you know.

TEDDY

Oh, tell the news to Mother.

ABBY

Oh, dear.

MORTIMER

Did you find those notes ?

MORTIMER

What's the matter ?

ABBY

There's a baby picture of your brother Jonathan.

MORTIMER

You ought to put that in the fire with my books. My, what a

face !

MORTIMER

I remember now. He used to scare grownups with it.

ABBY

Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me. Do you remember

how he used to cut worms in two with his teeth ?

MORTIMER

Oh, Jonathan ? Oh, he's probably in prison or hanged or

something by now.

MORTIMER

I saw a play, which had a character in it. Reminded me of

Jonathan.

ABBY

No ? Really?

MORTIMER

Yeah. Oh, a honey of a lunatic. One of those whodunits

called Murder Will Out.

ABBY

Oh, dear !

MORTIMER

Yeah, what a play. When the curtain goes up, the first

thing you see is a dead body.

MORTIMER

The next thing...

MORTIMER

Hey, mister.

ABBY

Happy bridegroom !

MARTHA

Congratulations, darling !

MORTIMER

Never mind that now. I know.

MORTIMER

Now, listen, darlings. Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha, you know how

we've always planned to send Teddy to that Sanitarium,

Happy Dale ?

ABBY

Oh, yes, dear. That's after we're gone.

ABBY

Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper about it.

MORTIMER

No, no. Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now. At once ! Now,

he's down in the cellar. Get him up here right away.

MARTHA

But, there's no such hurry as yet, you know.

ABBY

No... When Teddy's working on the canal, you can't get his

mind on anything else.

MORTIMER

Well, look, darlings. Look, I'm frightfully sorry, but I've

got an awful shock for you.

MORTIMER

Teddy's killed a man, darlings !

MARTHA

Nonsense !

MORTIMER

(he yells)

But there's a body in the window-seat !

ABBY

Yes, dear. We know.

MORTIMER

You know ?

MARTHA

Of course.

ABBY

Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy.

ABBY

Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it. Forget you ever

saw the gentleman.

MORTIMER

Forget ?

ABBY

We never dreamed you'd peek.

MORTIMER

What the... Who is he ?

ABBY

He's a Mister Hoskins. Adam Hoskins. That's really all I

know about him, except that he's a Methodist.

MARTHA

Oh ! He's a Methodist ? Isn't that nice.

MORTIMER

That's all you know ? But what's he doing here ? What

happened to him ?

MARTHA

He died.

MORTIMER

Look, Aunt Martha, men just don't get into window-seats and

die.

ABBY

No, dear. He died first.

MORTIMER

Oh, well, now wait ! Stop all this.

MORTIMER

Now look, darlings, how did he die ?

ABBY

Oh, Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died

because he drank some wine with poison in it.

MORTIMER

But, how did the poison get in the wine ?

MARTHA

Well we put it in wine because it's less noticeable.

When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor.

MORTIMER

You mean you...

(yelling)

You put it in the wine ?

ABBY

Yes. And I put Mister Hoskins in the window-seat, because

Reverend Harper was coming.

MORTIMER

Ohh ! Look at me, darling.

MORTIMER

You mean, you mean you knew what you'd done and you didn't

want the Reverend Harper to see the body ?

ABBY

Well, not at tea. That wouldn't have been very nice.

MORTIMER

Ohh ! It's first-degree.

ABBY

Now, Mortimer, you know all about it and just forget about

it. I do think that Martha and I have the right to our own

little secrets.

MARTHA

Oh, Abby, while I was out I dropped in on Missis Schultz.

She's much better. But she wants us to take Junior to the

movies again.

ABBY

Well, we must do that, tomorrow or next day.

MARTHA

Yes, but this time we'll go where we want to go. Junior's

not going to drag me into another one of those scary

pictures.

ABBY

No, they ought not to be allowed to make those pictures

just to frighten people.

MORTIMER

Operator ?... Can you hear my voice ?... You can ?...

Are you sure ?...

MORTIMER

Then I must be here.

MORTIMER

Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha !

ABBY

Oh, the dears. Isn't Halloween a wonderful time for them ?

MARTHA

Yes, it is. They have so much fun.

MARTHA

Now, Mortimer, don't be so impatient. We'll let you lick

the bowl out.

MORTIMER

Lick the bowl ? I don't want to lick the bowl. I want to

know what we're going to do !

MARTHA

Well, we're going to celebrate, dear.

MORTIMER

Celebrate ? There's a body in the window-seat !

ABBY

Yes, dear. Mister Hoskins.

MORTIMER

Oh, I know what his name is. I just want to know what we're

going to do. We can't turn you over to the police.

ABBY

Yes. You just should get stop worrying about it.

MARTHA

We told you to forget the whole thing.

MORTIMER

(yelling)

Forget ? Look, my dear aunt Martha, can't I make you

realize that something has to be done ?

ABBY

Now, Mortimer, you behave. You're too old to be flying off

the handle like this.

MORTIMER

But, but Mister Hodgekiss...

ABBY

Hoskins, dear.

MORTIMER

But whatever his name is, you can't leave him in there.

MARTHA

We don't intend to, dear.

ABBY

No, Teddy's down in the cellar now, digging the lock.

MORTIMER

Oh, you mean you're going to bury Mister Hodgekiss in the

cellar ?

MARTHA

Oh, yes, dear. That's what we did with the others.

MORTIMER

Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can't...

MORTIMER

Others ?

MARTHA

The other gentlemen.

MORTIMER

Oh ! When you say others, do you mean others ? More

than one others ?

MARTHA

Oh, yes, dear. Let me see now. This is eleven, isn't it,

Abby ?

ABBY

Oh no, dear. This makes twelve.

MARTHA

Abby, dear, I think you're wrong. This one is only eleven.

ABBY

No, dear, because I remember when Mister Hoskins first came

in, it occurred to me that he'd make just an even dozen.

MARTHA

But, look, Abby dear, I really don't think you should count

the first one.

ABBY

Oh, I was counting the first one, and that makes it twelve.

MARTHA

It does ?

MARTHA

Well, she's probably right. Abby usually is. I get them

mixed up sometimes.

MORTIMER

Makes it twelve. Well...

MORTIMER

Hello ?

MORTIMER

Oh !

ABBY

Well, whatever is the matter with Mortimer today ?

MARTHA

Why, Abby, what do you think happened to him ?

MORTIMER

Hello ?

MORTIMER

Not now. Not now. For heaven's sake, keep your shirt on !

MORTIMER

Oh... Oh, Elaine, I didn't mean...

MORTIMER

Now, let's see. Where were we ? Twelve.

(he yells)

Twelve !

MARTHA

Yes, dear. Abby thinks we should count the first one.

MORTIMER

Never mind about that. Just sit down.

MORTIMER

Now, tell me, who was the first one ?

ABBY

Mister Midgely. He was a Baptist.

MARTHA

He was such a lonely, old gentleman, Mister Midgely was.

ABBY

All his kith and kin were dead.

MARTHA

We felt so sorry for him.

ABBY

And then, when his heart attack came, and he sat there dead

in that chair, looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha ? We

made up our minds, then and there, that if we could help

other lonely, old men to find that same peace, we would.

MORTIMER

Why, you poor... You mean, he dropped dead right in this

chair ?

ABBY

And then, you see, Teddy came up from digging in Panama,

and he thought Mister Midgely was a yellow-fever victim.

And that meant he had to be buried immediately.

MORTIMER

So ?

MARTHA

So, we all took him down to Panama, and put him in the lock

and gave him a decent Christian burial. There, now you

see ?

(she stands up)

That's why we told you not to bother about it, because we

know exactly what's to be done.

MORTIMER

Wait a minute !

MORTIMER

Come here, darlings. What about the others ? All twelve of

them didn't walk in here and drop dead.

ABBY

Oh, no, dear. Of course not !

MORTIMER

Well, so, so...

MARTHA

Mortimer.

MORTIMER

Wh... what?

MARTHA

Do you remember those jars of poison that were on the

shelves in Grandfather's laboratory all these years ?

ABBY

You know your Aunt Martha's knack for mixing things.

You've eaten enough of her piccalilli.

MARTHA

Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine, I take one

teaspoonful of arsenic, then add half a teaspoonful of

strychnine. And then, just a pinch of cyanide.

MORTIMER

Mmmm ! Should have quite a kick.

ABBY

Yes, as a matter of fact, one of our gentlemen found time

to say : How delicious !

MORTIMER

He did ? Well, wasn't that nice of him ?

MARTHA

Abby, we mustn't be standing here gossiping all night.

Well, we must get that cake frosted.

MORTIMER

Oh no, darling, don't worry about the cake. I couldn't eat

a thing.

ABBY

Oh, you newlyweds! A sip of wine will give you an appetite.

MORTIMER

That'd be nice, darling, a sip of... A sip of wine !

MORTIMER

Wine !

MORTIMER

I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this.

MORTIMER

He's wonderful. Happy as a lark. Singing away, digging

locks.

MORTIMER

Got him working on a yellow-fever victim. Oh, I can see the

headlines now : Murder Incorporator Rides Again right

across the front page. Let me see... Teddy ! Of course.

Everybody knows he's crazy. Let me see. Who can I call up ?

Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell ? No, Winchell's no good. Old

Judge Cullman !

MORTIMER

I wonder if I got his number.

MORTIMER

What am I doing with tickets ?

MORTIMER

Information... Hello ? Information ?... Get me the number

of Judge Cullman on North Shore Road, Brooklyn. Yeah, would

you call me back ?

MORTIMER

How it would be marvelous if he wasn't there.

ELAINE

(voice over)

Hey, you !

ELAINE

Thought you were tall, dark streak of light.

MORTIMER

What are you doing here?

ELAINE

What am I doing here ? Didn't you hear me whistle ?

MORTIMER

Whistle ? Oh, yes, yes. I heard you whistle. But...

ELAINE

Hey, how do I look ?

MORTIMER

Oh, you look fine, you look fine. Now, run on home. I'll

call you up tomorrow.

ELAINE

Tomorrow ?

MORTIMER

Yeah, you know I always call you up every day or two.

ELAINE

Oh ! you and your gags ! Where's your hat ? Come on. The

bags are in the taxi.

MORTIMER

Huh ? Taxi ? Huh, huh, huh ?

ELAINE

Yeah, come on !

MORTIMER

Oh, Elaine, I'm so sorry. But something's happened.

ELAINE

What'd you do, lose your nerve ? Hey, where's that look

I was going to see so often ?

MORTIMER

Oh, stop ! Don't whistle in my ear, please.

ELAINE

Mortimer, what is wrong ? Look at your hair.

MORTIMER

Oh, my God, what color is it ? Quick ! Has it turned ?

ELAINE

Oh, darling, what's the matter ? What happened ?

MORTIMER

Oh, Elaine, if I could only tell you, Elaine. You smell so

nice.

MORTIMER

Oh ! Oh !

MORTIMER

You better go home !

ELAINE

But, darling, we were married today.

MORTIMER

All right, go home, go to bed, get some rest !

ELAINE

Rest ?

MORTIMER

Who ? Who ? Judge Cullman ?

MORTIMER

This is Mortimer Brewster. Look, Judge, I'll tell you why I

called you. It's about Teddy.

MORTIMER

I've got to come over and see you right away. Oh, I'm

afraid it won't wait until tomorrow, Judge. Yeah, you see,

it's very, very important. We've got to do something about

it immediately. But it's practically a matter of life

and...

MORTIMER

Elaine !

MORTIMER

Will you get out of here ?

ELAINE

Mortimer, what in the world is going on around here ? I

don't even know where I stand !

MORTIMER

Anywhere, but don't stand there !

ELAINE

But, darling, Niagara Falls !

MORTIMER

If it does, we'll let it !

ELAINE

Now, wait a minute ! Listen. You can't marry me one minute

and then throw me out the house the next !

MORTIMER

Oh, darling, I'm not throwing you out of the house !

MORTIMER

Will you get out of here ?

ELAINE

Mortimer !

MORTIMER

I'm sorry, Judge. But... a thing happened. But, Judge,

about Teddy, you see...

ELAINE

(voice over)

Mortimer !

MORTIMER

Hold it. You see, Judge, it's his bugle blowing. Yes, the

neighbors have been complaining, and the police are all set

to throw him into a state institution.

ELAINE

How do you like that ?

GIBBS

I read an ad here about a room to rent.

ELAINE

Oh ! Shut up !

MORTIMER

Well, I thought that if you sign the papers, I can get

Teddy to commit himself, and get him in Happy Dale... Yes,

it's a wonderful place, Judge... You will ?... Fine ! I'll

be over right as soon as I've made another call.

ABBY

Doorbell's ringing, dear.

ABBY

Oh, how do you do ? Come in.

GIBBS

(voice over)

I understand you've got a room to rent.

ABBY

Yes... Do step in.

GIBBS

Well, are you the lady of the house ?

ABBY

Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

Yeah, operator ? Give me long distance, please.

ABBY

And this is my sister. Another Miss Brewster.

GIBBS

My name's Gibbs.

ABBY

Well, do sit down. I'm sorry, but we're just setting the

table for dinner.

ABBY

Now, this would be a nice comfortable chair.

MORTIMER

Oh. Hello, long distance ? I want the Happy Dale

Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York.

ABBY

Is Brooklyn your home ?

GIBBS

I haven't got a home. I live in a hotel. Don't like it.

MARTHA

A... are your family Brooklyn people ?

MORTIMER

(voice over)

Hello ? Hap...

GIBBS

Haven't got any family.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

Well, operator...

ABBY

All alone in the world ?

GIBBS

Yeah.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

No, no...

ABBY

Well, Martha....

MORTIMER

(voice over)

No, Happy Dale... Yes.

ABBY

Well, you've come to just the right house. You sit down.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

Dale. D like in dig, you know, when you dig a lock.

That's right. A like in arsenic. Got that ?

GIBBS

Is there always this much noise ?

MARTHA

Oh ! He doesn't live with us.

MORTIMER

I can see the headlines now. Oh, please.

(back to normal voice)

Hello ?

GIBBS

I'd really like to see the room. Well, I don't think I'll

like it.

ABBY

The room's upstairs.

ABBY

Won't you try a glass of our wine before we start up ?

GIBBS

Never touch it.

MARTHA

Well, we make this ourselves. It's elderberry wine.

GIBBS

Elderberry ?

GIBBS

I haven't tasted elderberry wine since I was a boy.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

Oh...

GIBBS

Thank you.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

Operator ! Well, I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry !

I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium ! Sanitarium !

Sanitarium ! Sanitarium ! Yes, like a broken record !

GIBBS

Have your own elderberry bushes ?

MARTHA

No, but the cemetery's full of them.

GIBBS

Well, skoal.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

Hello, operator! No, operator, what's taking you so long ?

It's only across the river ! I could swim it faster ! Yes !

Hello ! Hello...

MORTIMER

(voice over)

What ?... What, they're busy ? Busy ? They're busy and

you're dizzy ! No, I'm not drunk, madam, but you've given

me an idea !

MARTHA

Mortimer ! Ah-ah ah-ah !...

MORTIMER

Darling, don't ah-ah ah-ah, I'm nervous. Don't do this.

ABBY

Mortimer. Not that.

MORTIMER

Get out of here ! Do you want to be poisoned, do you want

to be murdered, do you want to be killed ? Do you ?

GIBBS

They... they're nuts !

CAB DRIVER

Hey, you're telling me !

MORTIMER

Look, you can't do things like that !

MORTIMER

Now I don't know how I can explain this to you, but it's

not only against the law, it's wrong.

ABBY

Oh, piffle !

MORTIMER

It's not a nice thing to do. People wouldn't understand.

MORTIMER

He wouldn't understand. What I mean is... Well... This is

developing into a very bad habit !

MORTIMER

Oh... Yes...

MORTIMER

Hello ?... Who ?... Oh, Happy Dale Sanitarium ? Oh, that's

amazing, operator. Yeah... Happy Dale ? Oh, let me talk to

Mister Witherspoon, please.

WITHERSPOON

Mr. Witherspoon speaking... Oh, how do you do, Mister

Brewster ? How are you ?

MORTIMER

Uh... uh... Well, Mister Witherspoon, do you... Oh, I'm

fine, thanks. How are you ? Mister Witherspoon, do you

remember that conversation we had about committing my

brother Teddy to Happy Dale ?... You do ? Well, we want to

commit him there immediately.

WITHERSPOON

Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, that's too bad. Well, I'd hoped we

wouldn't have him for some time yet. Well, you see, Mister

Brewster, we have several Theodore Roosevelts at the

moment, and it would lead to trouble. Oh, trouble... Oh,

now, if he thought that... Look, Mr. Brewster, we're a bit

short of Napoleons at present. The Bonaparte. And if...

Oh... oh, I see. Of course. Well, if your mind is made up.

Yes. Yes. Have you had the papers drawn up ?

MORTIMER

No, but I'm going to attend to it right now and call you as

soon as I have them. Thank you, Mister... What ?... All

right. Thank you, Mister Witherspoon.

WITHERSPOON

Another Roosevelt. Oh, dear, dear.

MORTIMER

Now listen, darlings. I've got to run over to Judge

Cullman's, but, before I go, I want you to promise me

something.

MARTHA

Well, we'd have to know what it was first.

MORTIMER

Well, I love you both very much. And you know I'd do

anything in the world for you, don't you ?

ABBY

Yes, dear.

MORTIMER

All right, then I want you to do one little thing for me,

like good girls.

ABBY

What do you want us to do ?

MORTIMER

Don't do anything. I mean, don't do anything ! Don't let

anyone in the house and leave Mr. Whosit right where he is.

Oh ! Get off that thing. I can't talk to you... I can't

concentrate.

MORTIMER

Now, look, darlings, I wouldn't want anything in the world

to happen to either of you.

ABBY

But, what on earth could happen to us?

MORTIMER

Well, darling... Anyway, you'll do that little thing for

me, won't you ? All right.

MORTIMER

Where's my hat ? There it is.

MARTHA

But, Mortimer.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

What, darling, what ?

MARTHA

We were planning to hold services before dinner.

MORTIMER

Look, couldn't that wait until I get back ?

ABBY

Oh, and you could join us in the hymns !

MORTIMER

Yes, darling, I could join you in the hymns. I'll sing with

you, I'll dance with you, I'll do anything. But...

remember, don't let anybody in the house until I get back.

You promise ?

MORTIMER

Good.

ABBY

(voice over)

Mortimer !

MORTIMER

What ?

ABBY

Uh-uh-uh-uh !...

MORTIMER

Stop that uh-uh-uh. What is it ?

ABBY

Mr. Hoskins' hat !

MORTIMER

Ohhhh !...

CAB DRIVER

Do you still want me to wait here ?

MORTIMER

Yes ! Call me a cab !

CAB DRIVER

Yeah. Okay, okay !

CAB DRIVER

Hey, cab !... Here you are.

MORTIMER

Don't open it. I'll sit with you !

CAB DRIVER

Yeah, that's right. I can go faster that way. Sure.

CAB DRIVER

Wait a minute ! What am I doing ? Hey !

CAB DRIVER

Come here !

ABBY

Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat all mussed up.

MARTHA

Shame ! Such a nice hat.

MARTHA

You know, Abby, Mortimer didn't seem to be quite himself

today.

ABBY

No. Oh, well.

MARTHA

Well, what were you saying about Mortimer ?

ABBY

Oh, I think I understand why he seemed so upset.

MARTHA

Why ?

ABBY

He's just been married. I believe that always makes a man a

little nervous.

MARTHA

Oh, yes. The poor dears.

MARTHA

I'm so happy for Elaine. Oh, Abby ! If Mortimer's coming

back for the services for Mr. Hoskins, we're going to need

another hymnal. There's one up in my room.

ABBY

Oh, I'll go, dear.

MARTHA

Abby, we promised Mortimer we wouldn't let anyone come in.

MARTHA

Abby ! Two men, and I've never seen them before.

ABBY

Are you sure ?

MARTHA

Yes.

ABBY

Let me look.

MARTHA

You look.

MARTHA

Do you recognize them ?

ABBY

No, they're strangers to me.

MARTHA

Well, we'll just have to pretend we're not at home.

JONATHAN

Come in, doctor.

JONATHAN

This is the home of my youth. As a boy, I couldn't wait to

escape from this house. Now I'm glad to escape back into

it.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yes, Johnny, it's a good hideout.

JONATHAN

The family must still live here. I hope there's a fatted

calf awaiting the return of the prodigal.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

A fatted calf ? Oh, Johnny, I'm so hungry.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Look, Johnny. Drink.

JONATHAN

As if we were expected.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yes.

JONATHAN

A good omen.

ABBY

Who are you ? What are you doing here ?

JONATHAN

Aunt Abby. Aunt Martha. It's Jonathan.

MARTHA

You, you get out of here !

JONATHAN

I'm Jonathan, you know. Your nephew, Jonathan.

ABBY

Oh no, you're not. You're nothing like Jonathan, so don't

pretend you are. You just get out of here.

JONATHAN

I see you're still wearing the lovely garnet ring that

Grandma Brewster bought in England. And you, Aunt Martha,

still the high collar to hide the scar where Grandfather's

acid burned you.

MARTHA

Why, his voice is like Jonathan's.

ABBY

Have, have you been in an accident ?

JONATHAN

My face. Doctor Einstein is responsible for that. He's a

plastic surgeon.

MARTHA

But I've seen that face before. Do you remember when we

took the little Schultz boy to the movies and I was so

frightened ? It was that face.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy. Don't worry. The last

five years, I give him three different faces. I give him

another one right away. That last face. I saw that picture,

too, just before I operated. I was intoxicated.

JONATHAN

You see, doctor, what you've done to me ? Even my own

family think I'm...

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Johnny, Johnny ! You are home in this lovely house.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

You know how many times he tells me about... about

Brooklyn, about this house, and about his aunts he loves so

much ? They know you, Johnny. Please tell him so.

ABBY

Well, Jonathan, it's been a long time.

JONATHAN

Bless you. It's good to be home again.

ABBY

Well, Martha, we mustn't let what's on the stove boil over.

ABBY

If you'll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan. Unless you're

in a hurry to go somewhere.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Well, Johnny, where do we go from here ? You know, Johnny,

we got to think fast.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

The police, they got pictures of that face. I got to

operate on you right away. We got to find someplace. We got

to find someplace for Mister Spenalzo, too.

JONATHAN

Don't waste any worry on that rat.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But we got a hot stiff on our hands.

JONATHAN

Forget Mr. Spenalzo.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But, Johnny, we can't leave a dead body in the rumble seat.

You shouldn't have killed him. Just because he knows

something about us, what happens ?

JONATHAN

We come to him for help and he tries to shake us down.

Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff. That's your

work, doctor. You did that to me.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

No, please, Johnny, take it easy. We'll find some place

and I'll fix you up right away.

JONATHAN

Tonight.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first.

JONATHAN

This time, I want the face of an absolute nonentity.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yes, Johnny. I know exactly what I'm going to do.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

You see, I'm going to take this piece here and lift it

up...

JONATHAN

Be careful about the stitches this time.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

You leave that up to me. I'll give you nice little ears

and...

JONATHAN

You were careless last time.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

And new stitches. And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt. That's

my specialty. You see, I take it together like this...

JONATHAN

Leave the eyes alone. Leave the nose alone.

JUDGE CULLMAN

Poor Teddy. I imagine it's for the best.

JUDGE CULLMAN

Well... Ours not to reason why, ours but to do...

MORTIMER

Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me. Right there.

JUDGE CULLMAN

Sometimes I think, with the world in its present chaotic

state...

MORTIMER

Yes, I know, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale. I sign

here as next of kin, don't I ?

JUDGE CULLMAN

Only last week I created a mild sensation at the Bar

Association, when I said...

MORTIMER

Yes. Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you.

JUDGE CULLMAN

Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over this week. I've been

feeling rather lonely.

MORTIMER

No ! No ! Oh no ! Never tell them you've been lonely.

Never !

JUDGE CULLMAN

Why, I... I... I...

MORTIMER

Judge ! Tell me, are you a drinking man ?

JUDGE CULLMAN

Why, no. I never indulge.

MORTIMER

Good ! Then you'll live longer.

JUDGE CULLMAN

Of course a little wine now...

MORTIMER

No ! No ! For heaven's sake, no wine ! No wine !

JUDGE CULLMAN

I may be committing the wrong Brewster.

ABBY

Well, I'm sure you both want to get to wherever you're

going.

JONATHAN

My dear, sweet aunties, I'm so full of your delicious

dinner I'm unable to move a muscle.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yes, it's nice here.

TEDDY

I found it ! I found it !

TEDDY

Gentlemen, be seated.

TEDDY

Here it is, gentlemen. The story of my life, my biography.

TEDDY

Here's the picture I was telling you about, General. Here

we are, both of us. President Roosevelt and General

Goethals at Culebra Cut. That's me, General, and that's

you.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

My, how I've changed !

TEDDY

Well, you see, that picture hasn't been taken yet. We

haven't even started work on Culebra Cut. We're still

digging locks. And now, General, we will both go to Panama

and inspect the new lock.

ABBY

No, Teddy. Not to Panama.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Oh, maybe some other time, Mister President. Panama is a

long ways off.

TEDDY

Nonsense ! It's just down in the cellar.

JONATHAN

The cellar ?

MARTHA

Well, we let him dig the Panama Canal in the cellar.

TEDDY

General Goethals ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yes, sir.

TEDDY

As President of the United States, Commander in Chief of

the Army and Navy, and the man who gave you this job, I

demand that you accompany me on the inspection of the new

lock.

JONATHAN

Teddy ! I think it's time for you to go to bed.

TEDDY

I beg your pardon. Who are you ?

JONATHAN

I'm Woodrow Wilson. Go to bed.

TEDDY

No, you're not Wilson. But your face is familiar. Let me

see... You're not anyone I know now. Perhaps later, on my

hunting trip to Africa. Yes, you look like someone I might

meet in the jungle.

ABBY

I think, perhaps, you had better go to bed, Teddy. He and

his friend want to get back to their hotel.

JONATHAN

General Goethals, inspect the canal.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

All right, Mister President, we go to Panama.

TEDDY

Bully, bully ! Follow me, General.

TEDDY

It's down south, you know.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Oh !

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Well, bon voyage !

JONATHAN

Aunt Abby, I must correct your misapprehension. You talked

of our hotel. We have no hotel. We came here directly.

ABBY

This is not your home, and I'm afraid you can't stay here.

JONATHAN

Doctor Einstein and I need a place to sleep. You remember

that, as a boy, I could be disagreeable. It would not be

pleasant for any of us if... but I don't have to go into

details, do I ?

MARTHA

Perhaps we'd better let them stay here tonight.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hey, Johnny, Johnny. Come here. Quick.

JONATHAN

Oh, I forgot to tell you, Doctor Einstein and I are turning

Grandfather's laboratory into an operating room. We expect

to be very busy.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hey, Johnny, down here, what do you think I find ?

JONATHAN

What ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

The Panama Canal. And it just fits Mister Spenalzo. See the

hole he's digging. Four feet wide, six feet long. He just

fits ! You'd think he knew we were bringing Mister Spenalzo

along. That's hospitality.

JONATHAN

Rather a good joke on my aunts. They're living in a house

with a body buried in the cellar.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hey, how do we get him in here ?

JONATHAN

Yes, we can't just walk Mister Spenalzo in through the

door. We'll bring the car up between the cemetery and the

house, and after they've gone to bed, we'll bring Mister

Spenalzo in through the window.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hey, Johnny...

JONATHAN

We're moving the car behind the house. You'd better get to

bed.

MARTHA

The car is all right where it is until morning.

JONATHAN

I don't want to leave it in the street. That might be

against the law.

MARTHA

Abby ! What are we going to do ?

ABBY

Well, we're not going to let them spend more than one night

in this house, for one thing. But what would the neighbors

think ? People coming in here with one face and going out

with another.

MARTHA

And what are we going to do about Mister Hoskins ?

ABBY

Oh ! Mister Hoskins ! It can't be very comfortable for him

in there. And he's been so patient, the poor dear. Well, I

think Teddy had better take Mister Hoskins downstairs right

away.

TEDDY

General Goethals was very pleased. He said the canal was

just the right size.

ABBY

Teddy ! Teddy, there's been another yellow-fever victim.

TEDDY

Dear me ! This will be a shock to the General.

ABBY

No, Teddy, we must keep it a secret.

MARTHA

Yeah !

TEDDY

A state secret ?

ABBY

Yes, a state secret.

MARTHA

Promised ?

TEDDY

You have the word of the President of the United States.

Cross my heart and hope to die.

TEDDY

Now, let's see. How are we going to keep it a secret ?

ABBY

Well, Teddy, I think you'd better get back down into the

cellar. And then, when I turn out the lights, when

everything's dark here, you come up and take the poor man

down to the canal. Now get along, Teddy.

ABBY

And we'll come down later and hold services.

TEDDY

Where is the poor devil ?

ABBY

(voice over)

In the window-seat.

TEDDY

It seems to be spreading. We've never had yellow fever

there before.

MARTHA

Abby. I've never even seen Mister Hoskins !

ABBY

Oh, my goodness! That's right, you were out. Well, you just

come right along and see him now. You know, he's really

very nice looking, considering that he's a Methodist.

JONATHAN

We're bringing the luggage through here.

ABBY

Jonathan, your room is waiting for you. You can go right

up.

JONATHAN

I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours. You two run along

to bed.

ABBY

Oh, but you must be very tired. Both of you. And we don't

go to bed this early.

JONATHAN

It's time I came home to take care of you.

JONATHAN

(to Einstein)

Take the bags upstairs.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

For the instruments, I'll come back later.

ABBY

Good night.

JONATHAN

Now, we'll all go to bed.

ABBY

I'll wait until you're up and then turn out the lights.

JONATHAN

Run along, Aunt Martha. Just off the laboratory, Doctor.

JONATHAN

All right, Aunt Abby.

ABBY

I'll be right up.

JONATHAN

Now, Aunt Abby ! Turn out the lights.

JONATHAN

Aunt Abby.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

He's all right, Johnny.

JONATHAN

I'll open the window. You go round and hand him through.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But he's too heavy for me.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

You go outside, Johnny, and push, and I'll stay here and

pull. And then together we take him down to Panama. Huh ?

JONATHAN

All right. We must be quick. I'll take a look around

outside the house. When I tap on the glass, you open the

window.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yeah.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

It's dark in here.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Where am I ? Oh, here I am.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Who left this open ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Johnny ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Okay, Johnny, wait a minute. Hand him over. Now I have him.

Allez ! Up ! Now, wait a minute, Johnny. You lost a leg

somewhere. Hey, help me. He's so heavy. Now I have him. Now

I got him.

JONATHAN

Be careful.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Oh, but his shoe came off. Help me, Johnny. He's so heavy.

Now I've got him !

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hey, Johnny, somebody's at the door. Go open, quick.

I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick !

ELAINE

Mortimer ! Aunt Abby !

ELAINE

(voice over)

Aunt Martha !

ELAINE

(looking frightened)

Who is it ? Is that you, Teddy ?

JONATHAN

Who are you ?

ELAINE

I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door.

JONATHAN

What are you doing here ?

ELAINE

I came here to see my husband, Mortimer.

JONATHAN

Why did you say your name was Harper ?

ELAINE

Well, it is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster. I'm not very

used to it. I'm a brand-new Brewster.

JONATHAN

Doctor !

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

It's all right, Johnny. It's okay.

ELAINE

(voice over)

Maybe you'd better explain what you're doing here.

JONATHAN

We happen to live here.

ELAINE

(voice over)

You don't live here. I've been in this house every day, and

I've never seen you before. Where are Miss Martha and Miss

Abby ? What have you done to them ?

JONATHAN

Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves. May I present

Doctor Einstein ?

ELAINE

Doctor Einstein ?

JONATHAN

A surgeon of great distinction. And something of a

magician.

ELAINE

Now I suppose you're gonna tell me that you're Boris...

JONATHAN

(cutting her very harshly)

I am Jonathan Brewster.

ELAINE

Oh ! You're Jonathan.

JONATHAN

You've heard of me ?

ELAINE

Yes, they talk about you.

JONATHAN

What do they say about me ?

ELAINE

Oh, just that there's another brother named Jonathan,

that's all they say. Oh, that explains everything. Now that

I know who you are, I'll just be running along, if you'll

kindly unlock the door.

JONATHAN

That explains everything. Just what do you mean by that ?

Why do you come here at this time of night ?

ELAINE

Well, I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up. I suppose it

was you.

JONATHAN

You thought you saw someone drive up ?

ELAINE

Yes. Weren't you just outside ? Isn't that your car ?

JONATHAN

You saw someone at the car ?

ELAINE

Yes.

JONATHAN

What else did you see ?

ELAINE

Oh, just that, that's all !

JONATHAN

I see. Is that why you came over here ?

ELAINE

Oh no, I came to see Mortimer. But if he's not home, I'll

run...

JONATHAN

You've given two names.

ELAINE

You're hurting me !

JONATHAN

I think she's dangerous.

TEDDY

No visitors. It's going to be a private funeral.

ELAINE

Teddy ! Teddy, tell these men who I am !

TEDDY

Oh, that's my daughter, Alice.

ELAINE

Oh, no, Teddy ! Teddy !

TEDDY

Now, Alice, don't be a tomboy. Don't play rough with the

gentlemen.

TEDDY

Charge !

ELAINE

Teddy !

JONATHAN

Doctor, the cellar.

ELAINE

Let go of me ! Let go of me !

MARTHA

What's the matter ? What's happening down there ?

ABBY

What's the matter ? What are you doing there ?

JONATHAN

We caught a burglar, a sneak thief. Go back to your room.

ABBY

We'll call the police.

JONATHAN

I'll handle this. Go back to your room.

JONATHAN

Do you hear me ?

JONATHAN

Don't answer that.

JONATHAN

Don't answer that !

ELAINE

Let go of me !

MORTIMER

Where's Teddy ? Is he upstairs ?

MORTIMER

Never mind that now, darling, please.

MORTIMER

What are you doing with your best clothes on ?

MORTIMER

Holy... What's that ? What's that thing there that looks

like a cigar-store dummy ?

ABBY

It's your brother Jonathan, and this is Doctor Einstein.

MORTIMER

Aunt Abby, didn't I tell you not to let anybody in the

house ? Who did you say it was ?

ABBY

It's your brother, Jonathan !

JONATHAN

I've come back home, Mortimer.

MORTIMER

What ?

JONATHAN

I've come back home, Mortimer.

MORTIMER

I've come back home, Mortimer. Listen, it talks !

JONATHAN

Yes, I talk. Mortimer, have you forgotten the things I used

to do to you when you were tied to the bedpost ? The

needles under your fingernails.

ELAINE

Mortimer, he...

MORTIMER

Wait a minute.

MORTIMER

Holy mackerel ! It is Jonathan !

JONATHAN

I'm glad you remember, Mortimer.

MORTIMER

Yeah, I remember. How could I forget you ? Where'd you get

that face ? Hollywood ?

ABBY

Oh, don't you two boys start quarreling again the minute

you've seen each other.

MARTHA

We invited Jonathan and Doctor Einstein to stay.

MORTIMER

What ?

MARTHA

Just for tonight.

MORTIMER

Oh no, you don't, I'm staying here tonight. In fact, I'm

staying here from now on.

ELAINE

Mortimer, what about me ?

MORTIMER

There's no room for anybody else in the house.

(to Elaine)

Please, darling, just a moment.

(to Jonathan)

So take that little squirt and beat it !

(to Martha)

Now where's Teddy ? I've got to see him right away. Is he

upstairs ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Mister Brewster ! We don't take up much room. Johnny can

sleep on the sofa, and I'll sleep on the window-seat.

MORTIMER

Nothing to...

MORTIMER

Window-seat ?

MORTIMER

Certainly not on the window-seat. I'm going to sleep on the

window-seat.

MORTIMER

I'm going to sleep on the windows-eat from now on.

ELAINE

Mortimer !

MORTIMER

Now look. Now look, Jonathan. Now, be a good fellow. Here's

ten dollars. Go out and haunt yourself a hotel.

JONATHAN

Mortimer, you know what I do to people who order me around.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hey, Johnny. Mister Spenalzo.

JONATHAN

What ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

What's going to happen to Mister Spenalzo ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

We can't leave him here in the window-seat. Johnny ?

JONATHAN

Doctor, you know, Doctor, I've completely lost track of

Mister Spenalzo.

MORTIMER

Wait ! Who's this Mister Spenalzo ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

A friend of ours Johnny was looking for.

MORTIMER

Don't you bring anyone else in here. Now, come on, beat it,

both of you !

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

It's all right, Johnny. While we are packing, I'll tell you

about him.

JONATHAN

I'll take care of you, Mortimer, in just a little while.

MORTIMER

How do you like that ? The guy stays away for twenty years

and picks tonight of all nights to come back. Oh, Elaine,

what are you doing here ?

ELAINE

Mortimer !

MORTIMER

What's the matter, darling ?

ELAINE

I almost got killed.

MORTIMER

Killed ? Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha !

ABBY

Oh, no !

MARTHA

Oh, no ! It was Jonathan !

ABBY

He mistook her for a sneak thief.

MORTIMER

Oh, that.

ELAINE

(voice over)

It was worse than that. He's some kind of a maniac.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

I know, darling, I know.

ELAINE

(voice over)

Oh, Mortimer, I'm afraid of him.

MORTIMER

(voice over)

Oh, darling, don't worry about it. I'm here now. Now forget

it.

ELAINE

We were married today, we were going over Niagara Falls in

a barrel, your brother tries to strangle me, a taxi's

waiting, and now you want to sleep on a window-seat !

MORTIMER

Window seat... Witherspoon. Darling, you'd better run along

home.

ELAINE

What ?

MORTIMER

Yes, yes. Go home like a good girl. I got things to do.

ELAINE

Mortimer ? But... but...

MORTIMER

No, no, please.

(in the phone)

Hello ? Operator ? Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please.

ELAINE

But, Mortimer, didn't you hear what I was just saying ?

MORTIMER

Yes, 2-7-0.

ELAINE

Your own brother Jonathan, he was trying to strangle me !

MORTIMER

Please ! This is important !

ELAINE

That ?

MORTIMER

Hello ? Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon ? This is Mortimer

Brewster.

WITHERSPOON

Yes, Mr. Brewster, yes.

WITHERSPOON

Well, I don't understand you.

MORTIMER

(in the phone)

Look, look, I...

ELAINE

He was going to kill me !

MORTIMER

(to Elaine)

Wait a minute, I can't hear the man.

(to Witherspoon on the phone)

What ? I've got the papers all drawn up. I know it's late,

but I want you to come down here and get my brother

immediately ! I's got to be done.

(to Elaine)

Please, darling, please.

WITHERSPOON

By the way, you've had the papers signed by your brother

and the doctor, of course ?

MORTIMER

Oh, the doctor ? Oh, holy mackerel ! I forgot the doctor !

ELAINE

Mortimer !

MORTIMER

(yelling to Elaine)

Please, be quiet ! Can't you see I've got to get a doctor ?

(to Witherspoon on the phone)

Hello ? What kind of a doctor ? A family doctor ?

ELAINE

You can take your honeymoon, your wedding ring, your taxi,

your window-seat, and put them in a barrel, and push them

all over Niagara Falls !

MORTIMER

(to the departing Elaine)

Thank you, darling. Thank you.

(to Witherspoon on the phone)

Oh, look, why don't you come down here anyway ? While

you're getting here, I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's

signatures both.

MORTIMER

Yeah. Elaine ! Elaine !

(to Witherspoon)

Yeah, I'll get both signatures. Yeah, well, come right

away.

MORTIMER

Elaine ? What's the matter with her ?

MORTIMER

Oh, dear !

MORTIMER

Elaine ! Elaine !

MORTIMER

Elaine !

MORTIMER

(whispering to himself)

Oh, let me sit down. Let me think about this thing. Doctor,

Teddy, signature...

MORTIMER

Hoskins !

MORTIMER

Ye gods ! There's another one !

MORTIMER

Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha ! Come in here !

ABBY

(voice over from the kitchen)

We're busy.

MORTIMER

No, you come in here now !

ABBY

Yes, dear, what is it ? Where's Elaine ?

MORTIMER

Wait a minute. Didn't you promise me not to let anyone in

the house while I was gone ?

ABBY

Jonathan just walked in.

MORTIMER

I don't mean Jonathan !

ABBY

And Doctor...

MORTIMER

And I don't mean Doctor Einstein ! Who is that in the

window-seat ?

ABBY

We told you. Mister Hoskins.

MORTIMER

He is not Mister Hoskins !

MORTIMER

There !

ABBY

Who can that be ?

MORTIMER

You're trying to tell me you've never seen that man

before ?

ABBY

I certainly am. Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do ! It's

getting so anyone thinks he can walk in this house !

MORTIMER

Now, you look here, Aunt Abby. Don't you try to get out of

this ! That's another one of your gentlemen, and you know

it !

ABBY

Mortimer, how can you say such a thing ? That man's an

impostor. And if he came here to be buried in our cellar,

he's mistaken.

MORTIMER

You admitted to me you put Mister Hoskins in the window-

seat.

ABBY

Yes, I did.

MORTIMER

Well, this man couldn't have got the idea from Mister

Hoskins !

ABBY

Oh, no.

MORTIMER

By the way, where is Mister Hoskins ?

ABBY

He must have gone to Panama.

MORTIMER

What ? You buried him ?

ABBY

No, no, not yet. He's just down there waiting for the

services, poor dear. We haven't had a minute, what with

Jonathan in the house.

ABBY

Oh, dear. We've always wanted to hold a double funeral.

But I will not read services over a total stranger !

MORTIMER

A total stranger. Aunt Abby, how can I believe you ? There

are twelve men down there, some you admit you poisoned

them !

ABBY

Yes, I did. But you don't think I'd stoop to telling a

fib ! Martha !

ABBY

Martha ! Martha ! What do you think has happened ?

MORTIMER

A fib !

MORTIMER

Jon... Oh-oh... Ah-ah...

JONATHAN

This may interest you, Mortimer. I've decided that we're

staying. And I've also decided that you're leaving, and I

mean now.

MORTIMER

Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood to debate the question.

Are you getting out, or am I throwing you out on your ear?

JONATHAN

I've led a strange life, Mortimer.

ABBY

Martha, you come straight along here. You just look and see

what's in that window-seat.

MORTIMER

No. No, no, Aunt Abby, don't...

MORTIMER

Jonathan, let Aunt Martha see what's in the window-seat.

MORTIMER

Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology.

MORTIMER

I've got some very good news for you. Jonathan is leaving.

And he's taking Doctor Einstein and that cold companion

with him.

(to Jonathan)

Listen, Jonathan. You're my brother, you're a Brewster. So,

I'm giving you a chance to get away and take the evidence

with you. You can't ask for more than that. Well ?

MORTIMER

All right, in that case, I'll have to call the police.

JONATHAN

Don't reach for the telephone. Remember, what happened to

Mister Spenalzo can happen to you, too.

MARTHA

Spenalzo ?

ABBY

I knew he was a foreigner.

JONATHAN

Put down that telephone, Mortimer.

ABBY

Oh...

O'HARA

Hello !

ABBY

Oh, Officer O'Hara !

O'HARA

I saw the lights and thought you might have sickness in the

house...

ABBY

No...

O'HARA

Oh, you got company ? Oh, I'm sorry I disturbed you.

MORTIMER

No ! Come in.

ABBY

Yes, do come in.

MARTHA

Come right in, Officer O'Hara. This is our nephew,

Mortimer.

O'HARA

Oh, pleased to meet you.

MORTIMER

And glad to see you, fellow.

ABBY

And this is another nephew, Jonathan.

O'HARA

Pleased to make your acquaintance. Hey, your face is

familiar. Haven't I seen a picture of you somewhere

before ?

JONATHAN

I don't think so.

O'HARA

I'll be running along.

MORTIMER

Oh, come on. What's the hurry ? Why don't you stick around

until my brother leaves.

O'HARA

I got to ring in, Mr. Brew... Say, you're not the

Mortimer Brewster, the book-writer and the dramatic critic,

are you ?

MORTIMER

Yes, why ?

O'HARA

Oh, what a break for me ! I'm a playwright.

MORTIMER

No ?

O'HARA

I'm working on a play now.

MORTIMER

You are ?

O'HARA

Yeah.

MORTIMER

Well, well, well ! Maybe I can help you with it.

O'HARA

Oh, would you ? Oh, what a break ! I get wonderful ideas,

but I can't spell them.

MORTIMER

You can't ?... Oh, I can spell like the dickens.

Constantinople ? Come on, come on, let's go into the

kitchen.

O'HARA

All right.

MORTIMER

You can tell me all about it.

(to Abby)

Couldn't you whip up a sandwich for Officer O'Hara ?

MARTHA

I hope you don't mind eating in the kitchen, Officer

O'Hara.

O'HARA

And where else would you eat ?

MORTIMER

(to the policeman and his aunts)

See you in a moment.

MORTIMER

Now, listen, Jonathan, this is your last chance. I'll keep

O'Hara busy in the kitchen and give you a chance to get

out. All three of you : you, Doctor Einstein and Spenalzo.

JONATHAN

Mortimer...

MORTIMER

Now if you don't leave here in five minutes, I'll bring in

Officer O'Hara, and introduce him to Mr. Spenalzo.

O'HARA

Mister Brewster, my play takes place in...

MORTIMER

I'll be right with you, O'Hara. Right with you. Right with

you. Just give me one moment.

MORTIMER

Now get going ! All three of you.

JONATHAN

Doctor, this affair between my brother and myself has got

to be settled.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But, Johnny, we've got trouble enough as it is. Come, let's

go.

JONATHAN

We're not going. We're going to sleep right here in this

house.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

What ? With a cop in the kitchen and Spenalzo in the

window-seat ?

JONATHAN

That's all he's got on us. We'll take Spenalzo and dump him

in the bay. After that, we're coming back here. Then if he

tries to interfere...

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

No, no, Johnny. No, please.

JONATHAN

Doctor, we've got a wonderful setup here. We can make a

fortune. Two old ladies as a front. Only Mortimer stands in

our way. I never did like Mortimer.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

No, Johnny, please, take it easy. Please !

JONATHAN

Doctor, you know when I make up my mind...

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yeah, I know, when you make up your mind, you lose your

head. Look, Johnny, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Okay, Johnny. Okay !

JONATHAN

Take the instruments and hide them in the cellar. Move

fast.

O'HARA

Mister Brewster, you don't know what goes on in Brooklyn.

MORTIMER

Oh, I don't know.

O'HARA

No. My mother was an actress.

MORTIMER

Oh ? Legitimate ?

O'HARA

Of course she was. She was my mother.

MORTIMER

Oh, excuse me.

O'HARA

Peaches La Tour was her name.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hey, Johnny, Johnny, come quick !

JONATHAN

What's the matter ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

You know that hole in the cellar ?

JONATHAN

Yes.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Well, we got an ace in the hole.

O'HARA

It's no fly-by-night idea. I've been working on this thing

for twelve years.

MORTIMER

Well, you have ?

O'HARA

Yeah.

MORTIMER

Well, rehash it in your mind. I'll be back in a minute.

O'HARA

Oh, swell.

MORTIMER

I like the first act.

O'HARA

But I didn't tell you the first act, Mister Brew... I...

MORTIMER

No, I thought I told you...

MORTIMER

Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan !

JONATHAN

Yes, Mortimer.

MORTIMER

What are you two doing still here ? I thought I told you to

beat it.

JONATHAN

We're not going.

MORTIMER

You're not going ?

JONATHAN

No.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

No.

MORTIMER

You stay out of this. All right, you asked for it.

MORTIMER

Officer O'Hara ?

O'HARA

(voice over from the kitchen)

Coming.

JONATHAN

Now, if you tell O'Hara what's in the window-seat, I'll

tell him what's down in the cellar.

MORTIMER

Cellar ?

JONATHAN

There's an elderly gentleman down there who seems to be

very dead.

MORTIMER

What were you doing down the cellar ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But what is he doing in the cellar ?

JONATHAN

Now what are you going to tell O'Hara ?

O'HARA

Hey, your aunts heard my opening, it's swell. They want to

hear the rest. Shall I bring them in here ?

MORTIMER

No, no, no, no. You can't do that now. You'd better ring

in.

O'HARA

Oh, the heck with ringing in ! You got me rolling now.

I want to tell you the whole plot.

MORTIMER

You know, you can't tell me in front of those two fellas,

they wouldn't appreciate it.

O'HARA

Huh ? Hey, lowbrows, huh ?

MORTIMER

Let's go some place we can be alone. I'll meet you there

later.

O'HARA

Okay. Say ! How about the back room at Kelly's ?

MORTIMER

Kelly's ?

O'HARA

Yeah.

MORTIMER

Oh yeah, fine place for Bohemian atmosphere. Genius at

work.

MORTIMER

You ring in and I'll meet you at Kelly's.

O'HARA

Fine.

MORTIMER

Fine.

JONATHAN

Why don't you both go down in the cellar ?

O'HARA

That's all right with me.

MORTIMER

No, no, no. There's a much more literary atmosphere in

Kelly's, I assure you.

O'HARA

Okay.

MORTIMER

We'll meet later

O'HARA

This opening will kill you.

MORTIMER

You will.

O'HARA

I'm waiting to be born, you see, and the doctor comes in...

MORTIMER

Oh, the doctor !

O'HARA

Yeah !

MORTIMER

Yeah. Now, Look, you ring in and I'll see you later.

O'HARA

Okay. You won't stand me up, will you, Mister Brewster ?

MORTIMER

No.

O'HARA

This is a great play, you'll like it. I'll see you down

there.

MORTIMER

Can't wait ! Can't wait !

MORTIMER

Doctor, doctor. Where are those papers ? Oh, there they

are.

MORTIMER

Oh, oh-oh ! You're smug, aren't you? You think you've got

it over me. But you haven't. You think I'm afraid to go to

the police about Spenalzo because you've got hold of

Hoskins. Well, I'm not !

MORTIMER

The moment I get Spenalzo... I mean, the moment the doctor

signs this, I don't care who knows about him, Hoskins, I

mean. And you better feel the same way about Spenalzo. Yes,

Spenalzo !

JONATHAN

Where are you going ?

MORTIMER

To the Doctor. Where do you... Oh !

MORTIMER

When I come back, I expect to find you gone. Wait for me !

JONATHAN

We'll wait for him.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Did he look guilty !

ABBY

Well, Martha, I think we can start the services now.

ABBY

Oh ! We thought we heard you leave.

JONATHAN

Perish the thought, dear aunties. That was just Mortimer.

And speaking of services, Aunt Martha, will you make us

some coffee while we take Mister Spenalzo down to the

cellar ?

MARTHA

Oh, no. No, Jonathan. You've got to take him with you !

JONATHAN

There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs waiting for him.

ABBY

A friend of Mortimer's ?

JONATHAN

Take his feet, Doctor. Mister Spenalzo and he will get

along fine together. They're both dead.

MARTHA

Oh ! He must mean Mister Hoskins.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Mister Hoskins ?

JONATHAN

You know about what's down there ?

ABBY

Of course we do. And he's no friend of Mortimer's. He's one

of our gentlemen.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Your gentlemen ?

MARTHA

Yes. And we won't have any strangers buried in our cellar.

JONATHAN

But Mister Hoskins ?

MARTHA

Mister Hoskins is no stranger.

ABBY

Besides, there's no room for Mister Spenalzo. The cellar's

crowded already.

JONATHAN

Crowded ? With what ?

ABBY

There are twelve graves down there now.

JONATHAN

Twelve graves.

ABBY

That leaves very little room and we're going to need it.

JONATHAN

You mean that you and Aunt Martha have murdered twelve...

ABBY

Murdered ? Certainly not. It's one of our charities.

MARTHA

Why, what we've been doing is a mercy.

ABBY

So you just take your Mister Spenalzo out of here.

JONATHAN

You've done all that right here in this house and buried

them in the cellar ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

That's wonderful, Johnny !

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

We've been chased all over the world, and they stay right

here in Brooklyn, and they do just as good as you do.

JONATHAN

What ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yeah. You got twelve, they got twelve.

JONATHAN

I've got thirteen.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

No, Johnny, twelve. Don't brag.

JONATHAN

Thirteen.

JONATHAN

There's Mister Spenalzo. Then the first one in London.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yeah.

JONATHAN

Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney, one in Melbourne, two

in San Francisco, one in Phoenix, Arizona.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Phoenix ?

JONATHAN

The filling station.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Filling st... Oh, yes.

JONATHAN

Three in Chicago and one in South Bend. That makes

thirteen.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

You cannot count the one in South Bend. He died of

pneumonia.

JONATHAN

He wouldn't have died of pneumonia if I hadn't shot him.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

No, no, Johnny, you cannot count him. You got twelve, they

got twelve. The old ladies is just as good as you are.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

They are, are they ? That's easily taken care of. All I

need is one more. That's all. Just one more. And I've a

pretty good idea who it is.

MORTIMER

I'm a very lucky man to have caught you at home, Doctor

Gilchrist.

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

This is most irregular, most irregular.

MORTIMER

I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed, but, you see,

you're the only one who can help me.

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

I know Teddy blows bugles, but I can't commit a man to an

institution just on that.

MORTIMER

Oh, well, if only you had a little talk with him, I assure

you you'd be convinced by him. Here's the house I...

MORTIMER

There goes Hoskins.

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

Who ?

MORTIMER

What ? What ? Did I say... Oh, I...

MORTIMER

Now, you better wait.

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

Here ?

MORTIMER

Yes, I'll bring Teddy out. Well, you see, I wouldn't want

to alarm the old ladies, you know, seeing a doctor and

everything. You wait here, huh ?

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

In the cemetery ?

MORTIMER

Yeah, that'll be good.

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

It's Halloween.

MORTIMER

Oh, don't worry about that. At Halloween, the pixies won't

be out till after midnight. Now look, you wait here. Make

yourself comfortable. Pull up a tombstone. I'll be right

back.

CAB DRIVER

Hey, 22.50 !

MORTIMER

What ?

CAB DRIVER

22.50 !

MORTIMER

Oh, yes, looks good on you !

CAB DRIVER

Yeah ! Not the suit, the meter ! Looks good on me.

22.50 !

TEDDY

Did you give him a twenty-one-gun salute ?

MORTIMER

Yes, with a Maxim silencer.

CAB DRIVER

Hey, you. Five more bucks and you'll own it.

MORTIMER

Oh no, thanks. It wouldn't fit me.

MORTIMER

Oh, Mister President, may I have the pleasure...

TEDDY

Doctor Livingstone !

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

Livingstone ?

MORTIMER

(to the doctor)

Well, that's what he presumes.

(to Teddy)

Mister President, the doctor would like to have a few words

with you in private.

TEDDY

Certainly. Welcome to Washington, doctor.

TEDDY

Arlington is beautiful at this time of year, is it not,

doctor ?

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

Yes, indeed.

MORTIMER

Well now, that's that. It gives me a chance to rest.

MORTIMER

Well, so far, so good.

MORTIMER

Not so good.

ELAINE

Do you or do you not love me ?

MORTIMER

Oh, Elaine. Elaine, how can you say such a thing ? Darling,

of course I love you.

ELAINE

Do you ?

MORTIMER

Yes, darling.

ELAINE

Hey, then why have you been treating me the way you have ?

MORTIMER

Oh, Elaine.

MORTIMER

Elaine, Elaine, darling, I love you so much, I can't go

through with our marriage.

ELAINE

Have you suddenly gone crazy ?

MORTIMER

No, no, I don't think so, but it's only a matter of time.

Now, look, darling, you wouldn't want to have children

with three heads, would you ? I mean, you wouldn't want to

set up housekeeping in a padded cell.

ELAINE

What are you talking about ?

MORTIMER

Well, I don't quite know really. Look, I probably should

have told you this before, but you see... well, insanity

runs in my family.

MORTIMER

It practically gallops.

ELAINE

Oh, darling, just because Teddy's a little strange, that

doesn't mean...

MORTIMER

Oh no, darling, no, no. It's way back before Teddy. No,

this goes back to the first Brewster, the one who came over

on the Mayflower. Yeah. You know, you know how in those

days the Indians used to scalp the settlers ? Well, he used

to scalp the Indians.

ELAINE

Darling, that's ancient history.

TEDDY

Yes, Doctor, I'll run for a third term, but I won't be

elected. And that'll mean the last of the Roosevelts

in the White House.

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

That's what you think.

TEDDY

Of course, if the country insists...

ELAINE

Oh, darling, all this doesn't prove a thing. Look at your

aunts. They're Brewsters, aren't they ? They're the

sweetest, sanest people I've ever known.

MORTIMER

Yeah.

MORTIMER

Well, even they have their peculiarities.

ELAINE

What of it ? So your family's crazy. So you're crazy.

That's the way I want you, the way I love you. I'm crazy

too, but kiss me.

MORTIMER

No, no. I... Ohhh !

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

Goodbye, Ambassador. I've enjoyed this little talk very

much. Anytime you're in Washington, drop in to see me at

the White House.

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

Those papers. Those papers.

MORTIMER

Go away.

MORTIMER

Oh, papers ! Papers ! Yes.

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

I'll enjoy committing him to any place.

MORTIMER

You will ?

DOCTOR GILCHRIST

I've just been appointed Ambassador to Bolivia !

MORTIMER

Ah, you see ? Didn't I tell you ?

MORTIMER

No. Don't worry about that. Just go on signing the papers.

Oh dear. Thank you.

MORTIMER

Okay, thank you.

ABBY

All right ! All right ! We'll find out whose house this

is ! I'm warning you, you better stop it. There's no use

doing what you're doing, because it'll just have to be

undone.

JONATHAN

(voice over from the cellar)

Aunt Abby, go to bed !

ABBY

It's a terrible thing to do to bury a good Methodist with a

foreigner.

MORTIMER

Hello.

ABBY

Mortimer, where have you been ?

MORTIMER

Uh-uh ? Oh, I was getting some papers signed. Is Teddy in

his room ?

MARTHA

Oh, Mortimer, what is the matter with you ? Running around

getting papers signed at a time like this.

ABBY

Martha and I are going for the police.

MORTIMER

Police !

MORTIMER

Oh-oh-oh ! Wait-wait-wait ! You can't go for the police.

MARTHA

Oh, no ? You know what Jonathan's doing ?

ABBY

He's putting Mister Hoskins and Mister Spenalzo in

together.

MORTIMER

Oh, darling, let him.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

This is all fixed up nice now. Nice and smooth like a lake.

The President will be very proud of his Panama Canal.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Oh, Johnny, bed feels good already. You know, we didn't get

any sleep for forty-eight hours.

JONATHAN

You're forgetting, Doctor.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

What ?

ABBY

Now, look. If Jonathan and Mister Spenalzo aren't out this

house before morning, we're going for the police.

MORTIMER

Yeah, but I'll get them out, I promise you that !

ABBY

Then you get the wedding silver.

MORTIMER

Yes, but remember, no police ! No police ! All right.

MORTIMER

There's a thing. Look, go to bed, will you ? Fine. Get out

of those clothes ! You two look like a double blackout.

JONATHAN

My brother, Mortimer.

JONATHAN

I just heard him upstairs.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

No, no, no ! I am tired. You forget, I got to operate on

your face tomorrow.

JONATHAN

(voice over. We just see his shadow on the wall behind

Einstein)

You are going to operate tomorrow, Doctor. But tonight we

are taking care of Mortimer.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

No, but Johnny, not tonight ! I'm sleepy. We'll do it

tomorrow. Or the next day.

JONATHAN

(voice over from the shadow on the wall)

Look at me, Doctor. You can see that it's got to be done,

can't you?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yeah, I know that look.

JONATHAN

(voice over from the shadow on the wall)

It's a little late to dissolve our partnership.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Okay, okay, Johnny, okay. We'll do it. But the quick way,

huh ? The quick twist like in London.

JONATHAN

(voice over from the shadow on the wall)

No, Doctor. I think this calls for something special. I

think, perhaps, the Melbourne method.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Not the Melbourne method, please ! Two hours ! And then

when it was all over, what ? The fellow in London was just

as dead as the fellow in Melbourne.

MORTIMER

No, no, no. Don't do that, Mister President.

TEDDY

But I cannot sign any proclamation without consulting my

Cabinet.

MORTIMER

This must be secret.

TEDDY

A secret proclamation ? How unusual.

MORTIMER

Yes, it's the only way we can outsmart the other fellow.

TEDDY

Who's the other fellow ?

MORTIMER

That's the secret.

TEDDY

Oh, I see ! Very clever. Well, if it's a a secret

proclamation, it has to be signed in secret.

MORTIMER

Of course, Mister President.

TEDDY

I'll have to put on my signing clothes.

MORTIMER

Oh, you already have them on, Mister President.

TEDDY

So I have. Wait here.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hey, Mister Brewster.

MORTIMER

Yes, what is it ? Mice ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hey, Mister Brewster, you get out of this house.

MORTIMER

Can't you see I'm busy ?

MORTIMER

(singing the same tune)

Ta-ta-ta taaa !

MORTIMER

Thank you, Mister President. Oh, what a load off my mind.

Boy, could I use a drink ! Thank God for that.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

(whispering)

Get out of here, will you, please ?

MORTIMER

Huh ? What did you say ? Speak up, sonny. I can't hear you.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

(still whispering)

Johnny's in a bad mood. You get out of here !

MORTIMER

Stop underplaying. I can't hear you.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Please listen to me. Get out.

MORTIMER

Stop all this ! What are you doing ? Look, Doc. Are you

really a doctor ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yes, Heidelberg, 1919. You go...

MORTIMER

Heidelberg ? How'd you... How'd you come to hook up with

Jonathan ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

I tell you later about that, but you go now. Please listen

to me.

MORTIMER

Tch-tch-tch ! Stop it, Doctor, now stop it !

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

You get out of here ! Look, look, when Johnny's in that

mood, he's a madman. He's a maniac ! And then things

happen. Horrible things.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

You get out of here !

MORTIMER

Will you stop it ? Now look, stop telling me about

Jonathan, I'll take care of Jonathan, and you take care of

yourself. Now, get going, little fellow.

MORTIMER

What's that ? What's that ? Wait a minute.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Oh no ! My schnapps !

MORTIMER

I could use that. I could use that.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

That's mine.

MORTIMER

Please. Only for dramatic critics. Now look, you beat it

before things start popping around here.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But, look, Mr. Brewster, please. You've just been married.

You have a nice little wife waiting for you. Please go now.

Please.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Tell me, don't those plays you see all the time teach you

anything ?

MORTIMER

Oh, stop it, don't get me on the subject of plays ! I've

got a lot on my mind now. I've got to wait here for Mister

Witherspoon.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

At least people in plays act like they got sense.

MORTIMER

Oh, you think so ? Did you ever see anybody in a play ever

act like they got intelligence ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

How can somebody be so stupid ?

MORTIMER

You ought to have my job a few nights. Listen to me,

brother. When you get out of prison, you have yourself

wheeled over to the Garrick Theater. Oh ! Oh ! There's a

play there that's been running so bad that it'll still be

running when you get out. Now, in this, there's a man...

Now listen to this...

MORTIMER

Now, he knows he's in the house with murderers. So he ought

to know he's in danger. He's even been warned to get out of

the house. And does he go ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yes.

MORTIMER

No, he doesn't. He stays ! This fellow doesn't even have

sense to be scared or to be on his guard. No, no. The

murderer even invites him to sit down. What do you think he

does ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Well, I don't know.

MORTIMER

He sits down ! I remember what he did. He deliberately

pulls up a chair like that and he sits down in it.

MORTIMER

Isn't that great ? So there he is, all waiting to be

trussed up and gagged. What do you think they used to truss

him up with ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

(voice over)

Oh, what ?

MORTIMER

(voice over)

The curtain cord.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Curtain cord ? But didn't he see him get it ?

MORTIMER

Seen him get it. No. The silly chump sits down with his

back toward the murderer.

MORTIMER

All he has to do is look around, but does he ? No !

MORTIMER

(voice over)

No... Look, you see, brother Heidelberg, in a play or even

in a movie, for that matter, ...a fellow never sees or

hears anything. No. That's right.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But what does he do ?

MORTIMER

Oh, what does he do ? Well, the big chump sits there. This

fellow's supposed to be bright. He sits there.

MORTIMER

Now get a load of this. Look, look at the attitude. Large

as life ! He sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged.

The big dope !

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

You were right about that fellow. He wasn't very bright.

JONATHAN

Yes, Mortimer. I've been away for twenty years. But never,

my dear brother, were you out of my mind.

JONATHAN

In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you.

JONATHAN

The more you struggle, Mortimer, the more you strangle

yourself. Later on, you may consider that a blessing.

JONATHAN

Now, Doctor, we go to work.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Johnny, for me, please, the quick way. Please.

JONATHAN

Doctor, this must be an artistic achievement.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Please.

JONATHAN

After all, we're performing before a very distinguished

critic.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Johnny, please !

JONATHAN

Doctor !

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

All right. Let's get it over with. No, but, Johnny, I

cannot see this without a drink.

JONATHAN

Pull yourself together, Doctor.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

But I can't pull myself together without a drink. Johnny,

you remember when we came in here, there was some wine. And

then they took it. Where did they put it ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Johnny, I found some wine. I found some wine.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Here, I'll split it with you. We both have a drink before

we operate. Oh, I am so happy that we don't have to operate

without a drink.

JONATHAN

Doctor. One moment, please. Where are your manners ?

(to Mortimer)

Yes, Mortimer. I realize now that it was you who brought me

back to Brooklyn. We drink to you. Doctor ! To my dear,

dead brother.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Prosit !

JONATHAN

That idiot ! He goes next. That's all. He goes next !

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Not Teddy ! Not Teddy ! Please !

JONATHAN

We'll get to him later.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Not Teddy, we won't get to him at all !

JONATHAN

Now, we have to work fast. The quick way.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Oh, the quick way, oh yes ! If it has to be, then the quick

way. Yes, I'll help you with it.

O'HARA

Hey, the colonel has to quit blowing that horn.

JONATHAN

It's all right, Officer. We're taking the bugle away from

him.

O'HARA

I'd better talk to him myself. Where's the lights ?

O'HARA

Hey ! You stood me up ! I've been waiting for you for over

an hour at Kelly's. What happened to him ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Nothing. He was explaining a play he saw the other night

and that's what happened to a poor man in the play.

O'HARA

Oh, I see. Did that really happen in a play you saw ? How

do you like that ? You can't trust nobody no more. They

practically stole that from the second act of my play. You

know, in the second act, just... Well, maybe I'd better

start at the beginning.

O'HARA

Huh ? Oh, yes, sure.

O'HARA

Nooo ! You've got to hear the plot !

O'HARA

My mother's sitting there, making up, see. And, like a

flash, suddenly, out of a clear sky, the door comes open

and a man with a black mustache comes in.

O'HARA

He turns to my mother and he says, Miss Peaches La Tour,

will you marry me ? That's the first scene. My mother

doesn't tell him they're married. That's the surprise !

O'HARA

Oh, What a kick ! All right. Twenty-five years pass. Well,

in the meantime, there's me. Growing into a magnificent

specimen. So what do I do ? I join the police force and

become one of New York's finest. Well, I'm cleaning out a

crooked laundry, see ?

O'HARA

Little do I know it, but there is a dope fiend with a long

knife crawling after me. I'm in great danger. It's getting

you, ain't it ? I can see it in your eyes.

O'HARA

Well, you ain't heard nothing yet.

O'HARA

All of a sudden, a fire breaks out. What an effect ! The

firemen rush in and who do you think is leading them ?

Mayor Fiorello La Guardia !

O'HARA

What's the matter with him ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yeah, probably your play put him to sleep.

O'HARA

What ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

I personally, I like it very much.

O'HARA

It's probably over his head, huh ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yeah.

O'HARA

Where have I seen that face before ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

No, please.

O'HARA

Well, the scene changes. It's an evolving stage. I'm

walking along my beat, well, like that, casual-like, when a

guy that I'm following, it turns out he's really following

me !

O'HARA

(to Einstein)

Don't let nobody in.

(to Mortimer)

I figure I'll outsmart him. There's a vacant house on the

corner.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Hey, Johnny, the cops !

O'HARA

So, I ducks in there. I sees the door handle turn, so I

pulls out my gun, braces myself against the wall and I

says : Come in !

O'HARA

Oh, hello, boys.

BROPHY

What the Sam Hill's going on here ?

O'HARA

Hello Sarge, what do you think, this is Mortimer Brewster.

He's going to help me write my play.

SAUNDERS

Do you have to tie him up to make him listen ?

BROPHY

O'Hara, you better report in the station. Why didn't you

ring in ? You got the whole force out looking for you.

O'HARA

Right in the middle of the second act. Did they send you

guys here looking for me ?

BROPHY

No, we came to warn the old ladies. There is a difficulty.

The colonel blew that bugle again.

O'HARA

Yeah, I heard him.

BROPHY

The neighbors are all phoning in. The Lieutenant's on the

warpath. He says we've got to put him away someplace.

BROPHY

Now, who the heck is this ?

O'HARA

Oh, that's Mister Brewster's brother. My play put him to

sleep.

BROPHY

Oh ! That's the one that ran away. So he came back.

(in the phone)

Brophy. Get me Mac.

(to O'Hara)

Haven't you got yourself in a mess ! You're two hours

overdue at the station. I better let them know that I found

you.

O'HARA

Hey ! It wasn't that bad, was it ?

BROPHY

(in the phone)

Mac ? Tell the Lieutenant he can call off the big manhunt.

We found him... At the Brewster house... Shall we bring him

in ?... All right, we'll hold him right here.

BROPHY

The Lieutenant is on his way over.

JONATHAN

So I've been turned in, hey ? All right, you've got me. I

suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother will split the

reward.

BROPHY & O'HARA

Reward ?

JONATHAN

Yes, reward ! Now I'll do some turning in !

O'HARA

(to Jonathan)

Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.

JONATHAN

You think my aunts are sweet, charming old ladies, don't

you ? Well, there's thirteen bodies buried in the cellar !

Yes, thirteen.

BROPHY

Be careful what you say about your aunts, they happen to be

friends of ours.

JONATHAN

I'll show them to you.

BROPHY

Don't you make any trouble for them, do you hear me !

BROPHY

(to Mortimer)

Never mind, Mr. Brewster. Leave him to me, I'll take care

of him.

JONATHAN

(to O'Hara)

You come down to the cellar.

O'HARA

(to Jonathan)

Now, wait a minute.

JONATHAN

Thirteen bodies. I'll show you where they're buried.

O'HARA

Oh, yeah !

BROPHY

Go down to the cellar with him, O'Hara.

JONATHAN

Yes, come to the cellar.

O'HARA

Well, look, do I have to ?

O'HARA

Sorry, maybe I don't want to go down to the cellar with

him.

BROPHY

O'Hara, go on down the cellar with him !

O'HARA

Now, please, Mister Brewster. I'll tell you the rest of my

play later.

BROPHY

Go on down to the cellar with him.

O'HARA

Gee, do I have to, Sarge ? Look at that puss. He looks like

Boris Karloff.

O'HARA

(to Jonathan)

Don't !

(to Brophy)

Sarge !

BROPHY

(voice over)

Look out, Pat !... Look out, Pat !

SAUNDERS

(voice over)

He's got a gun...

BROPHY

(voice over)

I got him, Pat. Look out !

MORTIMER

Fight. Go on and fight.

MORTIMER

That's enough, that's enough. Everybody off.

BROPHY

(voice over)

Pat ! Pat, look out!

MORTIMER

Amazing... Such a fine day, too. All I did was cross the

bridge and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing. Amazing, amazing.

MORTIMER

Don't... Don't bother me now.

MORTIMER

Buddy, you could use this in the third act.

O'HARA

Oh yes, I got something better than this. Let me tell

you...

O'HARA

I'll see you later.

MORTIMER

I got the papers signed. There, they're all signed. What do

I care ? Go ahead, go ahead, fight, fight, fight-fight-

fight !

MORTIMER

I'd better call up and see if Witherspoon has left.

MORTIMER

Telephone. Hey !

JONATHAN

I'll get every one of you ! I hate cops. I'll brain the

first one that comes near me !

MORTIMER

Yeah. A little higher, please, brother.

MORTIMER

Thank you very much. Yeah, that's fine.

MORTIMER

Oh ! Don't do that, please.

BROPHY

Get him, Pat.

MORTIMER

(in the phone)

Come on, doc...

(to the cops)

That won't have any effect. I've tried it before...

MORTIMER

Oh, it did. Dear me ! Isn't that amazing ?

MORTIMER

Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.

MORTIMER

Witherspoon !

BROPHY

Come in.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

What has occurred ?

BROPHY & SAUNDERS

(speaking together)

Well, we...

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Never mind ! Didn't I tell you I'd handle this myself ?

O'HARA

Well, Lieutenant ! We were just acting in self-defense.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

(pointing to the body of Jonathan)

What happened ? He put up a fight ?

BROPHY

This isn't the one who blows the bugle. This is his

brother. He tried to kill O'Hara.

O'HARA

All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Boris ?... Turn him over.

BROPHY

Kind of think he's wanted somewhere.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Oh ! You kind of think he's wanted somewhere ? If you

guys can't look at the circulars we put up in the station,

you can at least read short detective stories. Certainly,

he's wanted somewhere. In Indiana ! He escaped from the

prison for criminally insane. He's a lifer.

MORTIMER

That's my brother !

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

For Pete's sake, that's the way they described him. He

looked like Karloff. Why'd you have to knock him off ?

BROPHY

He tried to get us to go down to the cellar. He says there

are thirteen bodies buried down there.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar, and that don't tip

you off the guy's come from a nuthouse ?

MORTIMER

Thanks, pal.

O'HARA

Say, lieutenant, about my not ringing in, I want to

explain...

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Where have you been all night ? Don't bother to tell me.

O'HARA

Oh, I was right here writing a play with Mortimer Brewster.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Yeah ?

O'HARA

Yeah.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Well, you're going to have a long time on that play.

O'HARA

Yeah ?

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

You're suspended. Now go on. Report in.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

(voice over)

Take this guy out in the kitchen and bring a pillow. I want

to find out where his accomplice is.

TEDDY

(to Mortimer)

What is the meaning of this commotion ?

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

The guy who helped him escape. He's wanted, too.

TEDDY

Here.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Forty-eight hours I've been after these guys. Nothing to

eat. No sleep. No wonder Brooklyn's in the shape it's in.

With flatheads like you on the force. Falling for a story

like that ! Thirteen bodies buried down in the cellar.

TEDDY

But there are thirteen bodies in the cellar !

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Who are you ?

TEDDY

I'm President Roosevelt.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

(whispering to Brophy)

What the blazes is this ?

BROPHY

He's the guy that blows the bugle.

SAUNDERS

Howdy, Colonel.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Well, Colonel, you've blown your last bugle.

(pointing to Jonathan's body)

Come on, get this guy out of here.

TEDDY

Dear me ! Another yellow-fever victim ?

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

What ?

TEDDY

All the bodies in the cellar are yellow-fever victims.

BROPHY

No-no-no, Colonel. This is a spy. We caught him at the

White House.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Take him out and bring him to. I want to question him.

TEDDY

If there is any questioning of spies, that's my department.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Hey, you, keep out of that.

TEDDY

You're forgetting that as President, I am also head of the

Secret Service.

MORTIMER

Huh-huh-huh !

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Who are you ? What's your name ?

MORTIMER

Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster. But I'm not quite myself

today.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Oh, you're his brother. Now, look, Mister Brewster, no

argument. He's got to be put away.

MORTIMER

No, no, no arguments, Captain. No arguments. Just a minute,

take it easy. Read this.

MORTIMER

Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight. I'm just waiting

here for Mr. Witherspoon.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Well, as long as he's going someplace. He's scaring the

neighbors, what with that bugle and all. And that cockeyed

story about thirteen bodies being buried...

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

You know, I've been without sleep for forty-eight hours.

I'm liable to think anything.

MORTIMER

I know just how you feel.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

There's people dumb enough to believe a story like that.

Last year there was a crazy guy, started a murder rumor. I

had to dig up a half acre plot before I could prove...

Ohh ! What's this ?

MORTIMER

What's the matter ?

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

These papers are no good.

MORTIMER

Why not ?

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

He signed it Theodore Roosevelt !

MORTIMER

He what ?...

WITHERSPOON

Is your cab engaged ?

CAB DRIVER

Yeah ! I'm losing dough every minute. Got me offers ?

WITHERSPOON

I'm Mister Witherspoon of Happy Dale Sanitarium, I have

come here to collect a Brewster. I would like you to drive

us back to the sanitarium.

CAB DRIVER

I knew this would end up in a nuthouse !

WITHERSPOON

We like to think of it as a rest home.

WITHERSPOON

Mister Brewster ? Mister Brewster ?

WITHERSPOON

Mr. Witherspoon is here.

MORTIMER

Supposing the spy steals this document and finds the name

Theodore Roosevelt on it. Think what that would mean to the

safety of the nation !

TEDDY

No, it's chicanery.

MORTIMER

Oh, wasting the time.

SAUNDERS

He's come to. He's ready to talk.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Hold him till I get there.

SAUNDERS

Yes, sir.

MORTIMER

Let me explain. The name Brewster is code for Roosevelt.

TEDDY

Code for Roosevelt ?

MORTIMER

Yes, don't you see ? Take the name Brewster. Take away the

B and what have you got ?

TEDDY

Rooster.

MORTIMER

And what does a rooster do ?

TEDDY

Crows.

MORTIMER

It crows! And where are you hunting in Africa ?

TEDDY

On the veldt !

MORTIMER

There you are ! Crowsveldt.

TEDDY

Ingenious ! My compliments to the boys in the code

department.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Hey, that's all right ! Do that again for me.

TEDDY

Never mind ! Give me that pen. This is fun.

MORTIMER

Now, now, all I got to get is Witherspoon.

MORTIMER

Oh ! Oh ! Mister Witherspoon, I can't tell you how glad I

am to see you. Mister Witherspoon... Before... Look... You

will take good care of Teddy at Happy Dale ?

WITHERSPOON

Best of care of him, Mister Brewster.

MORTIMER

Oh, that's fine. And no wagon when he leaves.

WITHERSPOON

Why ? To take him away ? Oh, never, never. Taxicabs. We

always... I have one waiting now.

MORTIMER

Yes, look, it means a great deal to me. You will personally

see that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale ?

WITHERSPOON

He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.

MORTIMER

Oh, that's good.

WITHERSPOON

You know, I sometimes envy some of our patients, secretly,

you know.

MORTIMER

Oh, you do ? It must be a nice place. Because I've never

been to Happy Dale.

WITHERSPOON

You never can tell.

WITHERSPOON

Oh, this is a particularly happy moment for me tonight,

Mister... Mister Brewster. Yes, I've never met a dramatic

critic and I had been so anxious to.

MORTIMER

Oh, the woods are full of them.

WITHERSPOON

I have here something that will explain what we're trying

to do out there at Happy Dale.

MORTIMER

Oh ! A pamphlet about Happy Dale ?

WITHERSPOON

Oh, no-no, it's a play. Something I've been working on for

some time now.

WITHERSPOON

It's a dramatization of many of the little incidents

that have happened here at Happy Dale.

MORTIMER

Captain ! Captain !... Captain !

WITHERSPOON

Now, I want you to read this very carefully. I want you to

be just as harsh as you like. I shan't mind, you know...

MORTIMER

Captain, this is Mister Witherspoon.

WITHERSPOON

Oh, yes, yes, he'll be very happy at Happy Dale. Come, my

boy.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

What is this?

MORTIMER

No, no, no-no, Mister Witherspoon, you got it wrong. This

is... this is Captain Rooney.

WITHERSPOON

The police ?... Oh !

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed. Now you can take

him away, Super.

TEDDY

I'll be in my office vetoing some bills.

MORTIMER

Mister President, I have good news for you. Your term of

office is over.

TEDDY

Is this March the four ?

MORTIMER

Practically.

TEDDY

Let's see... Oh ! Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa !

Well, I must get started immediately.

TEDDY

Is he trying to move into the White House before I've moved

out ?

MORTIMER

Who, Mister President ?

TEDDY

Taft !

MORTIMER

No, no, Teddy this isn't Mister Taft. It's Mister

Witherspoon, he's going to be your guide to Africa.

TEDDY

Bully ! Bully ! Wait right here. I'll bring down my

equipment.

WITHERSPOON

Happy man.

TEDDY

Goodbye, Aunt Abby, goodbye Aunt Martha. I'm on my way to

Africa. Isn't it wonderful ?

TEDDY

Charge !

MORTIMER

It's all right, Aunt Abby, I've got it.

WITHERSPOON

Oh, dear. And Happy Dale is full of staircases.

MARTHA

You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you ?

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

(voice over)

No, he's come to take him. Teddy's been blowing his bugle

again.

ABBY

Oh, no-no, no, he can't go now ! We won't permit it.

MARTHA

We promise to take his bugle away from him. We won't be

separated from Teddy.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

I'm sorry.

ABBY

Mortimer, how can you allow this ? You promised.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Mister Brewster's got nothing to do with this, see. The law

is the law ! Teddy's committed himself and he's got to go.

ABBY

Well, if he's going, we're going, too !

MARTHA

Yes, you'll have to take us with him.

MORTIMER

Why-why... why not ? Why not, indeed ?

WITHERSPOON

Oh well now, indeed, it's sweet of them to want to go, but

it's quite impossible. We never take sane people at Happy

Dale.

WITHERSPOON

Oh, no-no-no-no...

MORTIMER

(whispering)

Now, these two little sane people, mixed up with all the

others, will get lost in the shuffle. You could arrange

that.

WITHERSPOON

Oh, no-no-no-no...

MORTIMER

Just put them in and they'll get all mixed up.

WITHERSPOON

Oh, no ! No, no ! No ! Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

(voice over)

Now, let's be sensible, ladies...

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

...Here I am wasting my time when I could be doing some

serious work. You know, ladies, there are still murders

to be solved in Brooklyn. It ain't only his bugle blowing,

and neighbors being afraid of him. But things are going to

get worse. We're liable to have to dig up your cellar.

ABBY

Our cellar ?

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Yeah.

MORTIMER

Oh-oh !

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Yeah, Teddy's been telling around there's thirteen bodies

buried in the cellar.

ABBY

But there are thirteen bodies in our cellar.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

What ?

ABBY

Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer.

MORTIMER

Charge !

MORTIMER

(whispering)

Isn't that amazing ?

ABBY

Now, Mortimer, you behave yourself. You know very well

there are thirteen bodies down in our cellar.

MORTIMER

Certainly there's thirteen bodies down in the cellar. And

there are hundreds more up in the attic, Captain !

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

What is this ?

MARTHA

You mustn't mind Mortimer.

SAUNDERS

How about it, lieutenant ?

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

I'll be right there.

MARTHA

He's been a little strange all day.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Well, right now I wouldn't know what is and what ain't

strange anymore. I'll better have a look in that cellar.

MORTIMER

I'll tell you what we'll do, Captain. I'll bring my bodies

down from the attic and you get yours down from the cellar,

and we'll get them all together, and we'll send them to

Happy Dale.

ABBY

No, no, you wouldn't have to dig. The graves are all

marked. We put flowers on them every Sunday.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Flowers ?

MORTIMER

Sure, I put neon lights on mine.

MORTIMER

Humor them, humor them. Smile.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

What ?

ABBY

There's one down there, a Mister Spenalzo...

MORTIMER

(whispering)

Hasn't got it yet.

ABBY

...who doesn't belong here and who's going to have to

leave.

MARTHA

But the other twelve are our gentlemen.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Your gentlemen ?

MORTIMER

Oh, you'd like mine better. None of mine are gentlemen.

ABBY

You mustn't mind him at all. He got married today.

MORTIMER

(singing)

There is a Happy Dale far, far away. There is a Happy"

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

(nodding)

Yeah, yeah.

MORTIMER

He got it. It's amazing.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

(to Witherspoon)

Look, Super, don't you think you can find room for the

ladies ?

WITHERSPOON

Just the ladies ?

MORTIMER

Just the ladies, not me !

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

How about it, Super ?

WITHERSPOON

Well, of course, they'd have to be committed.

WITHERSPOON

Well, Teddy committed himself. Couldn't they commit

themselves also ? All they have to do is sign the papers.

WITHERSPOON

Certainly.

MARTHA

Oh well, if we can go with Teddy, we'll sign the papers.

Where are they ?

WITHERSPOON

I have them, ladies, I have them right here.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

(to Witherspoon)

Sign them up, will you, Super ? I want this all cleaned up.

I'm going out to talk to that spy. Maybe I can understand

him. Thirteen bodies down in the cellar.

WITHERSPOON

Ladies, if you will sign right here.

ABBY

(voice over)

Right here ?

WITHERSPOON

(voice over)

Yes, please. It's on the right-hand side right there.

ABBY

I'm really looking forward to going. The neighborhood here

has changed so.

MARTHA

Yes. Especially since they won that old pennant thing.

WITHERSPOON

Oh... oh, dear, I'm so sorry. We've overlooked something.

It's absolutely compulsory that we have the signature of a

physician.

MORTIMER

A doctor... Oh ! Doctor Einstein ! Come here and sign some

papers, please.

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Good night.

MORTIMER

Come here, Doctor Einstein.

WITHERSPOON

A doctor ?

MORTIMER

Oh, yes, yes. Doctor Einstein almost operated on me earlier

this evening. Come on, Doctor.

MORTIMER

Here. Just sign right here, please, Doctor.

ABBY

Were you leaving, Doctor ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

Yes, please.

MARTHA

Oh ! Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan ?

DOCTOR EINSTEIN

I don't think we go to the same place.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

(speaking on the telephone)

Hello, Mac. We picked up that guy that's wanted in Indiana.

His accomplice's description is one on the circular, on the

desk. Read it to me, will you ?

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

(still on the phone)

Yeah... About forty... Five-foot-three... One hundred and

forty pounds... Pop eyes... Talks with a German accent...

Poses as a doctor... Okay, Mac. Thanks.

WITHERSPOON

It's all right, Lieutenant Rooney. The doctor here has

completed the signatures.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Oh, that's great ! Thanks, Doc. You've done Brooklyn a

great service.

ABBY

But Dr. Einstein !

WITHERSPOON

(to Mortimer)

Now, Mister Witherspoon...

MORTIMER

No, no, you're Mister Witherspoon, I'm Mister Brewster.

WITHERSPOON

(laughing)

It's contagious, yes. It's your turn.

MORTIMER

Now, don't play games...

WITHERSPOON

You sign. You sign as next of kin.

MORTIMER

Oh, next of kin. Why didn't you say so ? I'm all confused.

Don't mind me.

TEDDY

Mr. Witherport.

WITHERSPOON

Spoon.

MORTIMER

Oh, here it is.

TEDDY

Come up and pack my duffel.

WITHERSPOON

Duffel ?

MORTIMER

Yes, duffel. Pack his duffel. He's President, you know ?

WITHERSPOON

Oh !

TEDDY

And bring along my bugle.

MORTIMER

President.

MORTIMER

Don't charge !

ABBY

Mortimer. Mortimer, we're really very worried about

something.

MORTIMER

Oh, now, darling, don't be worried.

MARTHA

Me too, Mortimer.

MORTIMER

Well, of course, darling.

MORTIMER

You'll both are going to be very happy at Happy Dale, will

you.

MARTHA

Oh yes, dear, we're very happy about the whole thing,

but that's just it. We don't want anything to go wrong.

MORTIMER

Well, what would go wrong ?

ABBY

Mortimer, will they investigate those signatures ?

MORTIMER

Oh, no, they won't look up Dr. Einstein...

MARTHA

But it's not his signature, dear. It's yours.

MORTIMER

Mine ?

ABBY

You see, you signed as next of kin.

MORTIMER

Oh, what's wrong about that, darling ?

ABBY

Well... Martha, you tell him now.

MARTHA

Well, dear.

MORTIMER

What, dear ?

MARTHA

You're not really a Brewster.

MORTIMER

Huh ? What ? What ?

ABBY

Your mother came to us as a cook. And you were born about

three months afterwards. And she was such a sweet woman and

such a good cook, we didn't want to lose her. So brother

married her. Your real father was a cook, too. He was a

chef on a tramp steamer.

MORTIMER

You mean... you mean I'm not really a Brewster ?... Oh !

MARTHA

Oh, darling ! Don't feel so badly about it.

ABBY

I'm sure it won't make any difference to Elaine.

MORTIMER

Elaine ! Elaine ! Where are you ? Can you hear me ? I'm not

really a Brewster ! I'm the son of a sea cook !

ELAINE

Mortimer ! Mortimer ! Mortimer ! It's true ! It's true ! I

saw them. Mortimer, it's true.

ELAINE

It's true ! There are thirteen bodies down there !

ELAINE

(mumbles through Mortimer's mouth)

But I saw them

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

What's all this screaming about ?

ELAINE

(mumbles through Mortimer's mouth)

But I saw them...

MORTIMER

It's way past her bedtime.

MORTIMER

Quiet !

ELAINE

But, Mortimer...

MORTIMER

Goodbye !

ABBY

Bye.

MARTHA

Goodbye, darling !

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

What is all this ?

ABBY

They're going on their honeymoon.

LIEUTENANT ROONEY

Well, they're off to a flying start.

O'HARA

(finishing the story he was telling the cab driver)

I pull my gun at...

CAB DRIVER

Hey !

MORTIMER

What ?

ELAINE

I really did see...

CAB DRIVER

Hey ! You'll own two cabs !

MORTIMER

Huh ?

CAB DRIVER

I mean the meter !

ELAINE

Oh, Mortimer.

CAB DRIVER

(imitating Elaine's voice)

Oh, Mortimer.

MORTIMER

(to the cab driver)

Oh, we're going to Niagara Falls. Call me a cab, dear.

CAB DRIVER

Yes, love.

CAB DRIVER

But, Mister Brewster !

MORTIMER

No, no, I'm not a Brewster. I'm a son of a sea cook.

MORTIMER

Charge !

CAB DRIVER

I'm not a cabdriver. I'm a coffeepot !

THE END
