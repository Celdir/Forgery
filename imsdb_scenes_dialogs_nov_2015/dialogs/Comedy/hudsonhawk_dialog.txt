UNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER

Leonardo, che pazzo.

DA VINCI

(silencing authority)

Basta vapore.

APPRENTICE TWO

Maestro, che meraviglia!

APPRENTICE THREE

Lei e' proprio fantastico!

DA VINCI

Lasciatemi, solo.  Solo!

DA VINCI

L'ho fatto.

WISE GUARD

We're losing our biggest celebrity

today.

YOUNG GUARD

You're kidding, Petey the Paint

Thinner Killer is getting paroled?

WISE GUARD

Not that slime, you Fizzhead.

Hudson Hawk.  The last of the

great cat burglars.

WISE GUARD

As a thief, Hawk was a poem.

Iambic fucking pentameter.  You

know, Crime used to have a little

class.  A hundred reporters were

here when he came in, now they're

probably out covering some tired

crack gang war...

HAWK

Remind me to fire my publicist.

YOUNG GUARD

Darn, these are for L-block...

YOUNG GUARD

- go back down to security and-

WISE GUARD

Guess this means, Hawk, you'll

be able to let yourself back in...

HAWK

Never happen.  Bet.  Ten bucks.

HAWK

Oh, give this back to Petey in A

block.  Tell him it was a sweet

gift, but I think he got some

wrong ideas about our friendship.

YOUNG GUARD

The Paint Thinner Killer did

this?  I think you picked a good

day to get out...

WISE GUARD

Hope I lose the bet.  Have that

cappuccino on me.

HAWK

(flipping him the

pipe cleaner)

You got it.  A double.

ANTONY

Welcome back, buddy ol' pal.

We've got a proposition...

HAWK

Answer's no, not even if you

bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario,

how's the "Family?"  Kill any

monkeys lately?

CESAR

How many times do I have to say

it?  I didn't put the hit on

Little Eddie... Never had anything

against that kooky chimp.  I

actually found him, "endearing."

HAWK

Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing

shots to the back of the head.

That's your mark, man.  What did

Little Eddie ever do to...

CESAR

You're hitting Rutherford's

Auction House.  Easy as my

brother's wife.  Directions are

in the bag.  Just open the seventh

floor safe and take out the

thingie...

HAWK

Or you cut off my thingie.

Directions even your brother

would understand.

ANTONY

(defensively)

Yeah, directions even I could

understand.

CESAR

Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got

set up, did some time, nothing to

be ashamed of.  Don't give me a

sonata about you always just

really wanted to settle down,

open a hardware Store and sell

spatulas...

HAWK

If the Mario brothers weren't

Jersey's third largest family,

I'd say kiss my ass.  But

considering your status, I'll

say slurp my butt.

CESAR

What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

HAWK

Baseball, why?

HAWK

I meant, ping pong.  Listen, I'd

rather go back in than whore for

you...

(stopping)

Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.

HAWK

Help?  Police?

CESAR

(unfazed)

You need some time to think.

That's cool, but next time, I'm

not going to say "Please."

HAWK

I don't believe this.  I've been

out forty seconds...

ALEX

That's the first thing I did.

Smooch the ground and taste the

freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss

anything?

HAWK

(getting up)

Your timing, and your shoes, are

impeccable...  Good to see you,

Alex, been having a lousy day.

ALEX

Lousy day?  The man's getting out

of prison and he's having a

lousy day.  What, you missing out

on the Cell Block Water Ballet

pageant?  Believe me, it's

overrated.

ALEX

Where's the kiss?  No tongue this

time, I promise.

HAWK

Looks like you've been expanding

your...

ALEX

Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm

incredibly sensitive about my

fucking figure.

HAWK

My next word was gonna be

"consciousness."  Swear to God...

tubby.

HAWK

That's your definition of "Hard?"

ALEX

Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come

Fly with Me."

HAWK

Three minutes, 51 seconds.

ALEX

Still do the puzzles, still know

the running times of songs, and

I'll bet you're still the best

damn cat burg--

HAWK

Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest

damn cat burg--I'm going to take

it so straight that I won't tape

a Mets game without the expressed

written consent of the National

Baseball League.

ALEX

Now that you're born again,what

do you wanna do?  Statue of

Liberty?  Entertain some ladies?

Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some

women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some

chicks?

HAWK

Come on, Alex, let's just get to

Alex's.  Your bar's the only

place that's going to cheer me.

God, I'd kill for a damn

cappuccino.  What the hell's a

Nintendo?

ALEX

Oh man, you still got a thing for

those unmasculine European coffees?

Who's your buddy?

HAWK

The man knows, the man knows!

ALEX

So Mr. Coffee, what went down

outside the prison?

HAWK

Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want

me to do a job.

ALEX

Those dago-guinea-I can say

this shit I'm Italian-wop

motherfu--

HAWK

Ah, had the perfect amount of

foam.  Just get me to the bar...

It's the one good thing in my

life that'll never change....

ALEX

I didn't know how to tell you.  A

couple brokers stopped in for

Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next

thing I know Fast Track Digest

votes us "Watering Hole of the

Month."  Now, I'm shopping for

Aqua Salmon wallpaper.

HAWK

I read about these people in

Newsweek.  Where's all the

regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the

Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's

Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain

Bob's steering wheel?

ALEX

Hey, get this irritable guy a

cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.

HAWK

This is Pizza?  Reindeer Goat

cheese?  I admit, I've been known

to go wild and order a Canadian

Bacon in my time, but..

TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER

Can you read.... smoker?

HAWK

Can you take a sunrise and

sprinkle it with dew?

TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER

(Huh?)

No.

HAWK

The Candy Man can, Felix.  You

know, I thought this was a country

where you could do any stupid

thing you wanted; drive to work

naked, make love to a V.C.R.

Guess I'm wrong.  Maybe that's

why I became a serial arsonist.

TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER

Hey, it's okay, big guy.  Smoke

all you want.  Have mine....

GATES (O.S.)

You're under arrest...

GATES

Have a seat.  Good to see you,

buddy ol' pal...

HAWK

The pleasure's all yours, Officer

Gates.

GATES

Why do you show your parole

officer such disrespect?

Especially after I got you such

a nice job.

HAWK

What job?

GATES

The auction house, asshole.  One

night's work and you're free like

no ex-con's ever been.  No

checking in with a shrink, no

community service teaching

retards how to play air hockey.

It's a great deal, I can't lie.

HAWK

The only thing you can't do is

get sex for free.  I know I was

in prison for like basically the

80's, but, call me daffy, aren't

you supposed to

stop

me from

committing crimes.  You know,

Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup,

Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

GATES

You wouldn't be out if it wasn't

for me!  I did dog and pony for

you!  You think they would have

let you out after what you did,

you told the board members they

looked like the Three Stooges...

HAWK

How was I supposed to know they

were women?  Besides one of them

was bald and kept saying

"Soitinly."

GATES

Remember that guy in the cell

next to you who hung himself?

HAWK

Yes.

GATES

Remember that shoe you lost...

HAWK

Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.

GATES

One phone call and your shoe

will become a piece of evidence

and that suicide'll become a

murder.

HAWK

What else do you got under there

... I don't want to be rude, but

this is all pretty lame.

GATES

That's the beauty.  It's bullshit,

but I can make it stick because

I'm a good guy parole officer and

you re a bad guy who's about to

find out that there's a thin line

between ex-con and escape con.

ALEX

How is everything tonight, sir?

GATES

Beat it, Alex.  You're a dinosaur.

HAWK

Alex, did you know this ape was

going to be here...

ALEX

Sure.  That's why his meatballs

are made out of marinated Chuck

Wagon.

GATES

(mouthful)

You're full of shit.

ALEX

No, man, actually you are.  Just

add water and it makes its own

gravy.  Keeps your teeth healthy

and your coat shiny.

ALEX

Hmmmm.....

HAWK

Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look

at this.

HAWK

It's Captain Bob's steering wheel!

Remember when the Captain.....

ALEX

Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.

HAWK

The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last

time I played the game, Simpson

only had a 40.

ALEX

Just means it'll take you an extra

31 seconds to seduce.  You re

still the best, I know it.

HAWK

But you got three guards who...

Shit, what am I doing?  Where's

the want ads?  Gonna sell some

spatulas.

ALEX

Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting

out a fire with kerosene.

HAWK

This isn't funny.  I'm not into

this.  I...

ALEX

There goes five seconds...My

record's eighteen.

HAWK

You're not...LISTENING!

HAWK

I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers.

Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford

Auction House.  By the way, how

many seconds?

ALEX

Rutherford Auction... that name...

HAWK

Alex!

ALEX

Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have

to change them.  "Witchcraft."

What's the running time?

HAWK

3:48.  I can't get you involved,

man.  This is my sewage and...

(re drawings)

God, you love all this, don't you,

you bastard.  Haven't you ever

heard of stamp collecting, or

curling?

ALEX

I'm in.  Have you seen the public

service announcements for Diabetes.

We can ride horses, play LaCrosse,

and knock off auction houses.  I

got a plan.  You won't have to hail

Cesar or Gates.

HAWK

I'm a bum.

HAWK

Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole

than that.

ALEX

Hey, you promised......Don't worry,

I'm wearing my girdle.

HAWK

Cameras?

ALEX

No need.  Guards' station's right

there.

ALEX

They record everything their

video surveillance takes in...

HAWK

Yes, master-thief, I can see that.

You said something about a plan...

ALEX

Am I boring you, smartass?  Watch.

A little rewind and re-wire action

and the Guards are going to be

watching a rerun and miss out on

our exciting episode.

SECURITY GUARD ONE

Check out Big Stan...

(walkie-talkie)

Big Stan!

ALEX

You got about five minutes and

change.

HAWK

5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."

ALEX

You know they invented something

while you were inside.  Called a

watch.

HAWK

"A mule is an animal with long

funny ears."

ALEX

"He kicks up at anything he

hears.

HAWK

"Or would you rather swing on a

star, carry moonbeams home in a

jar."

SECURITY GUARD TWO

Hell-o.  Check the Power room,

bud...

ALEX

swing on a star, carry moonbeams...

HAWK

"Or would you rather be a fish?"

BIG STAN

(moving back off)

Very funny.

HAWK

(lyric trouble)

"A fish is annuh nan na nan na

brook.

ALEX

"He can't write his name or read

a book.  To fool people is his

only thought."

HAWK

(remembering)

"And though he's slippery, he

still gets caught."

SECURITY GUARD TWO

Uh, Jerry.  I'm looking at the

seventh floor and I don't know

how to say this, I see the Blue

Chair.

SECURITY GUARD ONE

What the... You think that's weird,

check out screen two.....

SECURITY GUARD TWO

Somebody rewired the recorders!

HAWK

"And all the monkeys aren't in

the zoo."

ALEX (V.O.)

"Every day you meet quite a few."

HAWK AND ALEX

"So you see it's all up to you.

You can be better than you are.

You could be swinging on a star."

SECURITY GUARD ONE

Shit, let's roll!

ALEX

The song's over!  Come on!

"You could be swinging on a star."

HAWK

What am I doing here?  There are

so many things I wanna do that

aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse.

Kiss a woman in Italy.

ALEX

(more frantically)

"You could be swinging on a star."

HAWK

Paint a woman in a lighthou--I

don't want to steal a horse.

Life is...

ALEX

(DEADPAN)

"You could be swinging on a star."

You couldn't have waited to see

a psychiatrist.  No, you had...

HAWK

Let's go down the freight elevator.

ALEX

Keep those ideas coming.

ALEX

I'm not as unpleasantly plump as

that Guard am I.

HAWK AND ALEX

I got a bad feeling....

HAWK

I can't even swim.

ALEX

Hell, the fall'll probably kill

ya...

CUT TO:

GATES

Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of

honor.  How about a Gates-arita?

(toward bowl)

I used real hot dogs.

HAWK

Weren't you the bartender at

Jonestown?

CESAR

Good job, not pretty, but good.

HAWK

Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know

how to party or what?

GATES

All this trouble for a horsey.

I may not know art, but I know

what I like.

HAWK

(to Dog picture)

You certainly do.

GATES

So when's that Sebastian-Cabot-

Buckingham-Palace-looking-

Butlerhead getting here?

ALFRED

Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

GATES

Oh, sorry Jeeves.  Gates-arita?

ALFRED

I'll pass.  May I?

ALFRED

Ah, such craftsmanship.  Leonardo

Da Vinci's last commission for the

Duke of Milan.  Irreplaceable.

GATES

Hey, Mr. French, I'm delirious

for you.  Now where's my cut?

GATES

You son-of-a......I don't believe

this!  You come into my house!

GATES

I ought to take Big Ben and shove

it up your limey blimey bunghole!

GATES

Like I said.  Where's my cu-u-...

ALFRED

So much for his "cut."

(post-chortle)

Excuse my dry British humor.

CESAR

(rising)

Lovely work, Alfred, taking the

Concorde back?

ALFRED

Indeed I am, Mr. Mario.  I'm

really racking up those frequent

flyer points...

HAWK

I hate to interrrupt you two

lovebirds...

ANTONY

You know, I think Gates promised

Hawk a cut, too....

ALFRED

Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.

HAWK

(breathless)

Too-do-loo, babe.

ALEX

Did I miss anything?

HAWK

Oh, not much.  Gates just had his

tonsils taken out.  The hard way.

ALEX

Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we

send the thank you note to?

HAWK

The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross

between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart.

Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied

dumptied it over Gates's head.  He

said it was made by, get this,

Leonardo..

ALEX

(professorial)

Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece.

Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian

model of a never executed statue.

I consider it to be the prize of

tonight's auction of objets

d'equestrian.  Horse things.

HAWK

Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

ALEX

(holding up newspaper)

Morning edition.  Seems two thieves

"attempted" to steal it last night,

but thanks to three "courageous"

guards, it will be ready for tonight.

HAWK

"Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm

not happy about having to steal

that horse, but I do have my

pride.  Face it, when it comes to

burglary, and sex, I....

HAWK

Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...

ALEX

Why try?

HAWK

(hurdling the bar)

Because I'm tired of not

understanding things.  Cops,

Mafia, and butlers forcing me to

bust my ass to steal something,

which it turns out I really didn't

steal--it's fucked up.

ALEX

(pulling back newspaper)

You re not thinking of going to...

HAWK

Alex, my man, it's time to play a

little offense.  Where's your tux?

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

...fan-taas-tic example of

Florentine marble... Who will start

at 160,000...160,000......180,000.

HAWK

All these years of attending auctions,

I still get goosebumps.  The paintings,

the sculptures....the things that

aren't really paintings or sculptures...

THE WOMAN

.... the pretentious vultures who

don't even look up from their

calculators to see what they're

buying.  Now that gives me

goosebumps.  Auctions are

disgusting.

HAWK

I couldn't agree more.  Savages.

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

Lot Fifteen, an equestrian sconce

attributed to the Cellini school..

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

Sold!  To the caller from

Newfoundland.

ECCENTRIC BALD AUTIONEER

And finally, Lot number 17,

thought to be lost in the war,

and again last night, the Da

Vinci "Sforza," the jewel of the

sale.  Fan-taas-tic...

HAWK

(re: Auctioneer)

Is looking like a constipated

warthog a prerequisite to getting

a job in the art world?

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

There have naturally been questions

of its authenticity, so to verify

we have Doctor Anna Baragli of the

Vatican.  Doc?

ANNA

(rising, to Hawk)

Some of us warthogs are more

constipated than others.

HAWK

Oh, the shit is going to hit the

fa--

ANNA

(suddenly serene)

Fantastic.  Perfection.  The

Vatican extends its jealousy to

the lucky bidder.

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

We'll begin the bidding at 82.5

million dollars.  To you, sir.

Eighty-three, Ninety--your bid,

madame--Ninety point five.....

DARWIN MAYFLOWER

lOO million clams, Francesco!

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

100 million dollars to Mr. Darwin

Mayflower.

MINERVA

Francesco, 100 million and one.

DARWIN

Outbid by my own wench, quelle

bummere.

MINERVA

Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

Fan-taas-tic, the bid is at 100

million and one dollars.

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

Go-ing!

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

Go-ing!

ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

Gone!

ANNA

My God, that was bold of you,

you didn't have to do that...

HAWK

Forget about it--it was nothing--

anybody would have done the same

thing--It's an impulse...

ANNA

No, I meant you didn't have to

tackle me and rip my dress.  A

polite push, perhaps?  A clear

shout of "watch out, Anna"

would have done nicely...

HAWK

Excuse me, Milady.  I would have

flown over and carried you up to

a pink cloud, but I left my cape

at the cleaners.

ANNA

("Hey, I was kidding")

Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot.

Why was the guard chasing you?

HAWK

(Serious answer?

Na-a-h?)

Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

HAWK

Saint Pete, hey I know, the whole

cat burglar thing, it sounds bad,

but I'll take the worst cloud you

got...

CESAR

News flash.  You're not in

heaven.  Yet.  30 seconds and

counting, if you know what I'm

saying.  Couldn't just play along,

could you...

HAWK

Pretty class way of covering your

tracks.  I think that auctioneer

landed at La Guardia.

ANTONY

Subtlety was never one of our

strong points.

HAWK

Neither's flossing.

HAWK

Life don't get much better than

this.

CESAR

Make him into Roadkill!

ANTONY

Yeah, run him down!

HAWK

This is the worst night...

SNICKERS

When it rains, it pours.  Name's

Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

ALMOND JOY

Almond Joy.  I know, pretty silly.

But it's better than when we first

started out, our code names were

Diseases.  You don't know what

it's like being called Clymidia

for a year.

(walking off)

Whoops, forgot....

BUTTERFINGER

My name's Butterfinger.

HAWK

No shit.

KAPLAN

Don't you just hate kids...

ALMOND JOY

George, you promised.  No Old CIA/

New CIA jokes...

KAPLAN

I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks

think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea.

They think the Cold War involves

penguins and...

HAWK

Don't I know you...

KAPLAN

You just might.  I'm the guy who

tricked you into robbing a

government installation and then

had you sent to prison for it.  At

the time, I was bald with a beard,

no moustache, and I had a different

nose, so if you don't recognize me,

I won't be offended.

HAWK

Bastard, you're going to need

another nose!

HAWK

But I'm not the type of guy to

hold a grudge.

KAPLAN

I used you as a diversion.  while

you were getting captured upstairs,

I was shredding documents in the

basement.  Deep down, I guess I

was just jealous.  You were one

incredible thief...

HAWK

To what do I owe the dishonor of a

reunion, you centrally intelligent

scumsicle.

KAPLAN

I Want to make things up to you.

That's why I got you this gig,

doll.  Hawk, my name's George

Kaplan and to quote the late,

great Karen Carpenter, "We've only

just begun."

HAWK

Three minutes, twenty-three

seconds.  If you think I'm doing

another...

KAPLAN

Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.

HAWK

Employer?  The president?

KAPLAN

No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look.

what's that up there?

HAWK

I'm supposed to fall for that?

KAPLAN

Shucks.  Guess not.

HAWK

No.  Way.

ALFRED

Welcome to Rome, sir.

HAWK

Yes way.

DARWIN

For those kind of wages, I could

have built the factory in America!

They're Vietnamese, can't we just

give them more Bart Simpson shirts?

I hear depressing news like this

and I want to commit genocide!

(slamming phone)

Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk!

The Hawkster!  What do you think

of the vehicle?

HAWK

You could host American Bandstand

in here.  Why did you duck at the

auction, asshole?

DARWIN

Because I didn't want to get hurt,

taterhead.

DARWIN

What can I tell you, I'm the

villain.  Initially it was a

priority to keep a lot of buffers

between you and me, but since most

of them are dead now, I thought

what the heck.  Hawk, you come

highly recommended.  I would have

done some things differently at

the auction house, but hey, I want

to be in business with you.

HAWK

My life is not some deal.  I...

ALFRED (O.S.)

It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

DARWIN

I'm sorry, I have to take this.

Those are valid points though...

DARWIN

You better have a good excuse...

You better have a better excuse!

You are so weak!  I'm only

thankful your ancestors didn't

settle America or else my name

would be Running Brave or Vomiting

Antelope...Really.  Well, listen

close, babe.

DARWIN

Shall we?

DARWIN

So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince

words...

HAWK

Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you

own Park Place, you own the four

railroads.  You think you're God.

For all I know, you're probably

right.  I just wanted to have a

damn cappuccino, maybe play some

Nintendo after I find out what it

is.  Man, why didn't you just

buy

the horse?  What am I saying, you

did buy it...

DARWIN

Oh... Let's see.  There are

organizations that think we wanted

the "Sforza" for reasons other

than putting it in the Da Vinci

museum we're building in Vinci.

Hopefully, these organizations

think our plan has been ruined

with the explosion of our replica.

If I seem vague, grand.  We want a

low profile on this, that's why I

got Kaplan and the Candy bars

involved.  I helped George help

the Mario Brothers and Gates help

get you out....

HAWK

If you're pausing for a "thank you,"

give it up.  So boss, you going to

tell me what the crystal piece

inside the pony means?

DARWIN

Way to go, Alfie!  How many people

did you break that thing in front

of.   Good help's hard to find.

HAWK

I guess that's a no.

DARWIN

Ladies and gentlemen of the board...

DARWIN

And Min-er-va.  Let's give it up

for Hudson Hawk.

MINERVA

Hello......Bunny, Ball-Ball!

DARWIN

Hawkmeister, we got you clothes,

great hotel, and a 250,000 lira

per diem.

MINERVA

That's two hundred dollars a day?

So he can get a hooker and some

tequila.  Veto, Darwin.

HAWK

Guess I know who wears the penis

in this family.

MINERVA

(jumping off table)

For God's sake, chain this

convict.

HAWK

Alfred, you're a very polite

psychopath, but if you...

MINERVA

We want Da Vinci's sketchbook,

what do they call it, the Codex.

DARWIN

Listen Hawk, this might be hard to

believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I

just want to be happy and happiness

comes from the achieving of goals.

It's just when you make your first

billion by the age of 19, it's

hard to keep coming up with new

ones.  But now finally I got my

new goal.  World domination.  With

your help...Bunny....quit that!

MINERVA

Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!

HAWK

Think he's already got today's

ball-balls.  Five more minutes

please, it's been so long...

HAWK

Anybody have a cigarette?  But

seriously, do me a favor and

Concorde me back to prison.  I

don't care anymore.  I hope you

have the receipts for the threads.

MINERVA

You go back, you won't be alone.

You'll have a diabetic barkeep

cellmate.  You're still young

enough to have fun shanking child

molesters for a pack of smokes,

but "Alex" will go in knowing that

the next time he gets out it'll be

to attend his own funeral.

Depressing.

HAWK

You wouldn't risk the dime to call

the police.  You have no proof.

DARWIN

Ah, the magic word...

DARWIN

It's veja du, Hawkhead.  Something

you wish never happened.  We shot

the entire operation with hidden

cameras behind the hidden cameras.

Hired the guy who did the last

Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.

Excellent work... whoops, damn

Fotomat assholes...

MINERVA

Tomorrow, you're going to hit a

church.

CUT TO:

HAWK

I'm robbing the Vatican.  The nuns

at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end

up doing this...

HAWK

(half-hearted)

Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed

into robbing the Vatican by a

psychotic American corporation

along with a CIA...

VATICAN GUARD

"You're being".....uh, I don't,

uh...

HAWK

Forget it, man.  Go tackle a

jaywalker.

HAWK

Operator, I want to make a collect

call to Alex Messina, New York....

ANNA (V.O.)

But it is his gift as an inventor

who drew together science and art

that is most incredible.

ANNA

Tough guy.  What are you--How's

your head.

HAWK

(vegetable)

Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...

ANNA

As you know, the Da Vinci Codex,

has lived in the Vatican for

centuries and will continue to

live here for centuries more.

HAWK

(under his breath)

That's what you theenk.

ANNA

Question, sir?   His untiring pen

predicted the airplane, the

submarine, the bicycle, the

helicopter, and even the tank.

LITTLE BRAT

This is so bor-ing!  Do you hate

Italy as much as I do, Pokey?

(bad ventriloquism)

Si, senor!  Italy sucks the big

one!  why can't we go to the Epcot

Center!

ANNA

These more dangerous designs

inspired him to develop a secret

code that ....

LITTLE BRAT

Pokey, come back!

ANNA

Come on, this stuff will knock you

out.  Have you ever had the feeling

you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

HAWK

Never, why do you ask?

HAWK

Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie

Hawkins.

My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't

call me Hudson, not even as a joke.

The Nuns at St. Agnes called me

that and they're the ones who

helped make me what I am today.

Not a compliment...

ANNA

Sure Hudson.  Are you going to

tell me why you did that back there

or are you going to blame it

on Dumbo?

HAWK

Could you believe that crazy

elephant?

HAWK

Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times

Square?

ANNA

Delivers up to ten at night.  The

Pope has an obsession with his

Easter Seals.  It's actually not

that an unusual set-up.  The

secret passageway on the other

hand....

HAWK

The Vatican is made of constant

mysteries meant to be enjoyed,

not explained.

ANNA

Nice.  But right out of our

brochure.

HAWK

Oh, you read that.

ANNA

Actually I wrote it.  It's a good

sentence.  It can apply to people.

HAWK

You're not an unmysterious thang

yourself.

ANNA

I don't steal stuffed elephants

from little girls.

(smoothing his

jacket)

And I buy my own clothes.  My

life's a little boring...

HAWK

God, I wish I could say the same

thing.  What about having a nice,

dull dinner with me tonight.

Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes,

Anecdotes about famous dead

Italians....

ANNA

I'll bring my entire repertoire...

HAWK

And I'll bring my entourage...

ANNA

Secret passageways don't mean as

much as they used to.  There's

a place two blocks east of here.

Enzo's.  Say 10:30.

HAWK

Said.

ANNA

Father, it's obvious.  He's up to

something.

JESUS (Italian)

Report downstairs at once.

ANNA

Yes, sir.

CARDINAL

Did he mention the Mayflowers?

ANNA

No, your Eminence.  I think he's

going to steal the Codex, as

early as next week.

CARDINAL

Attempt, you mean.  The vanity

of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The

Vatican has foiled the advances

of Pirates and Terrorists.  We

will not lie down for some

schmuck from New Jersey.  Must

you flirt with him so realistically?

ANNA

That's the best kind.  A wise

woman once said "Polite

conversation is rarely either."

CARDINAL

(chuckling)

Let me be the one to quote

Scripture.  ....As an agent of

our organization, you are put in

awkward situations.  Just

remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil,

evil man.

ANNA

(unconvinced)

Yeah.  The big E.

HAWK

Hello, operator.  I'd like to

make a collect call to New York

number...

HAWK

Thank you, operator, thank you.

HAWK

Come on, Alex, pick up, you

Reindeer goat cheese-eating

motherfucker.

HAWK

A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex.

KAPLAN

Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying

Italy?  I always had a soft spot

for Rome.  Did my first barehanded

strangulation here.  Communist

politician.

HAWK

Why George, you big softie...

KAPLAN

God, I miss communism.  The Red

Threat.  People were scared, the

Agency was respected, and I got

laid every night.

BUTTERFINGER

Sorry, coach...

KAPLAN

(shaking his head)

If his father wasn't the head of

Shit, I hate this, the

government's got me farmed out,

working for the Mayflower

corporation now, money beats

politics.  War isn't Hell anymore,

it's Dull.  Don't slaughter their

men and rape their women, just

steal their microchips.

HAWK

You know Kaplan, if you weren't

the slimiest pinata of shit that

ever lived, I'd feel sorry for

you.

SNICKERS

Good news, bud, the Mayflowers

have moved up the time-table.

You're hitting the Vatican to-night.

HAWK

Tonight?  You're whacked.  The

timing's off, I'm underequipped

Damnit, I have a date!

ALMOND JOY

Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray,

black turtleneck, Pocket

Fisherman, acid, collapsible

yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps.

Gee Stud, this is going to be

some date.  No Harvey's Bristol

Cream?

KAPLAN

Snickers, make the list happen.

Oh and it's one thing to play

hide and seek with the Mayflower's

pathetic staff, but we're sore

losers.  I've put jumper cables

on the nipples of children and

not always in the line of duty.

HAWK

Thanks for sharing.

KAPLAN

We blow up space shuttles for

breakfast.  You and your friend

Alex would be a late afternoon

Triscuit.

HAWK

If you do anything to my friend...

KAPLAN

Yeah, right.  By the way, as long

as I'm getting things off my

chest, I'm the one who killed your

little monkey.  Made it look like

a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun.

Ciao.

HAWK

What did you have against Little

Eddie, motherfucker?  He was just

a monkey who liked to laugh.

Come back without your yuppie

army.  I'll triscuit you, you

space shuttle eating...Shit.!

BUTTERFINGER

Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72

stamps!

HAWK

"Beware the Odd Steps."

HAWK

Why Kit Kat, aren't you a

gentleman...

HAWK

Please God, Please God.......let

the guard shoot me.

VATICAN GUARD

The worm's on the other foot,

yankee noodle candy.

ANNA

Oh Hudson, I was worried you

weren't going to drop by....

HAWK

I never break a date.  Scout's

honor.

HAWK

Fettucini con Funghi Porcini.

WAITER

Bellissimo, signor.

HAWK

Oh, and could I have some ketchup

with that.

SNICKERS

Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger,

Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France,

you gotta have French.....

ALMOND JOY

Actually we're in Italy, Snickers,

she said as if it made a difference.

SNICKERS

Italy, France, Moscow.  They all

just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man

Kaplan thinks since Communism is

dead, we got nothing to do.  Man,

Democracy isn't free elections.

We gotta teach the world that

Democracy is Big Tits, College

Football on Saturdays, Eddie

Murphy saying the word "Fuck"

and Kids putting their hands down

garbage disposals on "America's

Funniest Home Videos."

ALMOND JOY

Damn baby, when's the last time

you had a vacation...Jesus, I

gotta get out of this job.  If

my Mom knew her daughter

assassinated the leader of the

anti-Apartheid movement....

SNICKERS

Quit bitching, you got the

employee of the month plaque for

that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is

and in love.

HAWK

This is bueno.  They had the worst

ketchup in prison.....uh...

ANNA

Prison?

HAWK

I was the Warden?

ANNA

How long were you in?

HAWK

Let's just say, I never saw E.T.

ANNA

Wow, you were "in the joint."

"Doing hard time."  It's funny,

but that excites me.  I seem to

have a thing for sinners.

HAWK

I seem to have a thing for sinning.

sinning.  Check please....

WAITER

Ah, anything for dessert?

ANNA

(she shoots)

Yes.  Something to go.

HAWK

(she scores)

I'll bring the ketchup.

INT. ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT

The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas

bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling

a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his

bruises.

ANNA

What have you been doing?

HAWK

Uh....old badminton injury.

HAWK

tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

ANNA

(not stopping)

Oh, I'm so sorry...

ANNA

I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....

HAWK

(softly approaching)

Hey now, outside of a very

friendly dog this morning, it's

been a slow decade.  I don't make

love every ten years, I get a

little cranky.

ANNA

It's also been a long time for

me.  I--

HAWK

Catholic girls are scary...

ANNA

Somebody robbed the Vatican.

HAWK

Oh.  No.

HAWK

It's not what you think.  Okay,

maybe it is....

ANNA

You really went and did it.  With

one day, not even a day, of

planning, you did it.  Nobody

does it better, Hudson.  You

started the week stealing the

Sforza and you ended it swiping

the Codex.

HAWK

Wha--

ANNA

What are your plans for the

weekend?  Hoisting away the

Colosseum?  Tell me, did the

devil make you do it or did

Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

SNICKERS

What's going on in there?

BUTTERFINGER

Do you want me to rape them?

(throwing pastry down)

Dunkin does it better.

SNICKERS

Just read, Butterfinger.

BUTTERFINGER

"Da Vinci had fears about his

more dangerous designs, so he

created a shorthand code in

reverse script..."

ALMOND JOY

To yourself!.....What are they

doing?  In twenty seconds, we go

in.

ANNA

For two years, I've been tracking

the Mayflowers' peculiar interest

in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their

Sforza replica was as fake as

the "gas leak" that supposedly

destroyed it.

HAWK

Does everyone in the world know

more than me?  Jesus, I'm just

some guy who happens to be good

at swiping stuff.....Lifted a

piece of licorice when I was one

and a half.  Who knew it would

lead... They even got the CIA

involved!

ANNA

The C.I. what?  God, no...

HAWK

(raising his cup)

Ooh, I guess I do know something

Here's looking at you, kid...

ALMOND JOY

Now.

HAWK

This doesn't taste like

cappuccino.

ANNA

Oh, I must have put too much

ethyl-chloride in it.

ANNA

Why didn't you tell me at the

restaurant that he had hit the

Vatican tonight.  My people will

not be happy.  I want to see Kaplan.

ALMOND JOY

That's not overly possible.  He...

BUTTERFINGER

But guys, remember, he's in the

castle at Vinci....

KAPLAN

Way to go, Anna.

ANNA

When the Mayflowers find out we

have the Codex, they're going to

want to make a deal...

KAPLAN

(gung-ho lying)

And then we'll arrest those

greedy pigs... Is that it?

ANNA

Actually George, it's not it.

What are we doing in this castle?

I happen to know the Mayflowers

bought this castle last year when

they found out Da Vinci used to

do...

KAPLAN

(trying to be solemn)

It's the site of their new museum

and we're taking it over.  Operation

Deflower Mayflower is going full

speed ahead.

ANNA

(taking it in)

Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is

that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins,

had some "neat" things to say about

Darwin, Minerva, and you.

Basically that you're part of the

same car pool.

KAPLAN

Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were

true, Almond Joy would have

handed you your heart right

after you handed me the Codex.

Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...

ANNA

Cat got his tongue?

KAPLAN

Actually he never told us what it

was.

ANNA

How sweet.  I trust you will see

Hudson Hawk is given to the proper

authorities.  I recommend

leniency...

SNICKERS

(holding in a laugh)

Oh, I think we all do.

SNICKERS

Do you think she has any idea that

Operation Deflower Mayflower is as

bogus as Kit Kat's tits?

KAPLAN

I don't think so, although bringing

her to the castle gave her a big,

juicy hint.

ALMOND JOY

With all due respect to that great

blouse, why didn't I cut out her

heart?

KAPLAN

Close call, but she's our only way

of keeping tabs on that damn

mysterious Vatican organization.

Hawk, it's time to go to the

principal's office....

DARWIN

Seven!

ALFRED

Jolly.  Good.  Shot.  Sir.

MINERVA

Ooh, it's Hudson Hawk, you cease

to amaze me, convict.  You are a

terrible

cat burglar!

DARWIN

Haven't you ever seen, like David

Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe

out.

MINERVA

Like a "cat", one could say.

HAWK

Shucks, I'll just take it back.

MINERVA

(bouncing up)

No, let me!

DARWIN

(pout)

I don't care.

HAWK

Another piece of the puzzle for

the Da Vinci Alchemy project.

DARWIN

Oh, you.  There's nothing more I

hate than failure.  All you had to

do was follow the Hawk, it's not

like I said "Teach our nation's

children how to read."

DARWIN

I guess we're just going to have

to kill 'em...

DARWIN

God Minerva, I was

kidding

.

MINERVA

Get away from there, convict!

HAWK

Just browsing.  Don't touch me....

DARWIN

Don't hurt him!  We need him for

the final job!

HAWK

Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me?  Even

if I do this....

HAWK

And this....

HAWK

Surely this must offend....

KAPLAN

That's it!

HAWK

Things are getting a little loose

at the Da Vinci workshop tonight.

"Put your left leg in, take your

right foot out."  May I call you

Minnie....

DARWIN

Come to think of it there is a part

of your body that you won't need for

your next job...

HAWK

Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing

like Franki Valli and the other seasons,

but come on....

MINERVA

Big girls don't cry-I-eye.

HAWK

Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit,

I'm involved in this thing, so I

just wanna know what this thing is.

I wanna be treated as an adult.

DARWIN

That's fair.  Tomorrow.  Back in

Rome.  Now go to your room.

ANNA

Forgive me Father for I have

sinned.  It's been 1200 hours

since my last confession.

CARDINAL

Hit me with your best shot.

ANNA (O.S.)

I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An

innocent man.  A thief.

CARDINAL

Anna, what are you trying to say...

ANNA

He came into a world where crime

is a legitimate business tactic

and a legitimate government

procedure.  But he knew Right and

Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed

around...

CARDINAL

"Messed around" messed around?  I

know-- I don't want to know.  First

base?  Second Base?  Stop me when

I'm getting warm...

ANNA (O.S.)

A little petting is not the issue!

CARDINAL

Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and

five minutes outside.

CARDINAL

So let me get this straight,

sister, you're saying Hudson Hawk

is not willingly working for the

Mayflowers but Kaplan and the

Candy Bars

are

?

ANNA

You got it.  Operation Deflower

Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the

punchline.  I thought we were using

the CIA to help us to get Mayflower,

but really the CIA was using me to

keep us away from Mayflower.

CARDINAL

Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal

in charge of catering.... If the

Mayflowers get the three sections

of Da Vinci's crystal and his

instructions for the gold machine--

Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of

Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his

loyalty?

ANNA

I'm going to find out.

CARDINAL

I'm sorry for losing it back there,

but you must remember, sister, you

have vows to God as well as a mission

to the world.

ANNA

I know, I know, your Eminence, just say

"God go with me."

CARDINAL

God go with you, sister.

DARWIN

So, Captain Hawk, in one of your

paws you got a gold bar worth

about 8 thou.  In the autre, you

got lead that won't get you

gelato.

MINERVA

Surely a master-thief like you can

tell the difference.

HAWK

("What's my Line")

That's two down to Kitty

Carlisle...

MINERVA

Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel,

mal1eability, they're all but

identical.  On the periodic chart

of elements, they're but one

proton apart.  Great minds worked

for centuries to turn worthless

into priceless.

HAWK

Alchemy.

DARWIN

(casually goosing Alfred)

Alchemy!  Is the business term of

the 90's, my man!  Minerva read

about it in an airline magazine

about four years ago.  I dumped

some lira into research... Shazam,

we come across a diary by one of

Da Vinci's apprentices detailing

La Machine de Oro, the gold machine

for those at home, and the rest is

about to become history.  Money

isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck

blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills!

Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real

deal!  Money will always be paper

but gold will always be gold!

MINERVA

Market crashes.  Bomb drops.

Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll

still be the richest, most powerful

people in the world.  In 1992,

Europe is coming together to become

one business superpower.  It's one

party we'd love to poop.

DARWIN

Well, that said, the last

ingredient in the recipe is in, get

this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

HAWK

Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense.

The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen,

this is all too Indiana Jones and

the Lost City of King Tut for me,

man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead,

just try and throw Alex...

MINERVA

Jail, you asshole!  Our foot

soldiers will blow your brains

out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

DARWIN

I'll torture you so slowly you'll

think it's a career!  I'll kill

your family, your friends, and the

bitch you took to the Prom!

HAWK

You want an address on that last

one?

HAWK

Bunny, not you too?

MINERVA

You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I

think I know what's going to help

you solve it.

HAWK

I'll kill all you.  Even the old

lady.

ALEX

I hated cigarettes until I saw my

first No Smoking sign.  Keep off

the Grass?  Let's play Soccer.

Only law I cared about was

friendship.  Broke that one too,

didn't I?  This Gates-Mario

Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci

thing seemed like a sweet deal.

Visit foreign lands, take their

treasures.  I don't know, I thought

you'd get into it.  It's better

than playing darts with M.B.A.'s at

the bar.  I didn't know it was

going to be like this.  Them using

me to use you... I'm sorry, there's

only one way out of this and it's

gonna hurt me more than it's gonna

hurt you.

KAPLAN

I just don't think it was a

smoking hot idea to leave them up

there alone.

MINERVA

Don't worry George, this is the

reason we put the old diabetic

guinea on the payroll to begin

with.  To keep Hawk in line.

They'll talk about "being buddies"

and "chugging brewskis."

DARWIN

(raising glass)

You gotta love male bonding.

KAPLAN

You were saying...

HAWK

You bastard!  You fucked my

freedom for a lousy job!

ALEX

Hawk... I'm so sorry...

HAWK

No.....Alex!  Wake up, you can't

go out like this.

MINERVA

Plan B, anyone...

ANNA

Oh thank God, you're dead...

ALEX

It was so beautiful!  When the

blanks went off, they...

HAWK

You bastard.  You fucked my

freedom for a lousy job.

ALEX

But I said I was sorry....

HAWK

No sweat, Alex, you only made the

biggest mistake of

my

life.  What

was your per-diem?

ALEX

Don't act like you've never committed

a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I

made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

ANNA

Hudson, don't you understand...

HAWK

And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky

I don't hit women, assuming you are

a woman.  I'm not taking anything for

granted anymore.

ANNA

I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian-

organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me.

I-care-for-you...

HAWK

Oh.  Well, what's this?

ANNA

Where did you get this?

HAWK

You know, the place where you gave

the bad guys the Codex.... the

Mayflower Museum.

ANNA

It's from the machine.  All they

need is the crystal to run it and

they have 2/3 of it already.  We

can't let that happen.

ALEX

You're saying you want us to beat

them to the crystal and save the

world from financial disarray.

ANNA

Something like that.

ALEX

(pulling out plane

tix)

Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I

are going to Rio.  We're hurt,

we're tired, and a hero ain't

nothing but a sandwich.  Right,

buddy?...

ANNA

Hudson, God's given you a gift for

cat burglary, you can t just...

HAWK

You better believe I can.  I'm

sick of people telling me what I

have to do.

ANNA

It's that kind of selfish attitude

that...

HAWK

Selfish attitude?  I'm just some

guy who wants a little nap and a

cappuccino for when he wakes up,

not too much foam...

ANNA

You re not "some guy" anymore,

Hudson.  Right now, you're the

only guy.  Without your help, I....

HAWK

The world is beautiful.  Every day

in prison I made sure to remember

that.  It's only when I actually

got out that I forgot.  If I was

sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio.

But being beaten and abused to

fulfill some corporation's

perverted vision does something to

your mental health.  The world is

beautiful and I'm tired of being

fucked.

(turning around)

It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to

bite the pillow...

ANNA

That was beautiful.

ALEX

I laughed, I cried.

HAWK

Rio, Alex?  After all they've

done to...Hey, these tickets are

for Moscow!

ALEX

(knowing smile)

Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin

thing is in Moscow, isn't it?

ANNA

Ketchup.  Stupido Americani...

KAPLAN

We're all family now.  My team

has done a lot of rougher things

than steal the model of a

helicopter.

SNICKERS

We're going to whack this place

so fast we'll have time to shop

for American imports.

ALMOND JOY

Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is

located in a wing of the Kremlin

that they used to throw the Miss

Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll

have the least number of guards....

KAPLAN

As for our plan of action,

anybody'd be insane to go in

from the ground floor...

ALEX

We're going in from the ground

floor.

HAWK

Geez, this Art Treasures Room

looks like a burnt diaphragm.

HAWK

Hey, don't take your disguise so

seriously.

ANNA

Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit

nervous.  I'm sorry I could only

score clergy passports.

HAWK

Fits my new image.  A thief for

the masses.  This is one job I'm

not going to feel guilty about

enjoying.  Gum.

ALEX

The security's actually not that

severe.

ANNA

It doesn't have to be.  Everybody

knows that if you mess with the

Kremlin, you'll end up in a

Siberian gulag eating your own

fingernails.

HAWK

Shwoof, that makes me feel better.

I can't believe this is the Iron

Curtain.  All the guy at Airport

customs wanted to know was "Who

Shot J.R.?"

ALEX

You sound disappointed.

HAWK

Yeah, I mean, come on, going

through the Iron Curtain is

supposed to be crawling

underneath barbed wire, it's

supposed to be strangling a

guard...

HAWK (V.O.)

It's supposed to be parachuting

in the moonlight....

SNICKERS

We are the blue light.  The green

light is where the Art Treasures

room is.

KAPLAN

Let's go make a purple light.

Where's Kit Kat?

ALEX

Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.

ANNA

Gum.

HAWK

Count of three?

ALEX

Why not just go now?

HAWK

Okay.

KAPLAN

Everything's going fine, Minerva,

thanks for asking...

MINERVA

I say who needs this Hudson Hawk

anyway....

HAWK

(Wizard of Oz)

Oh-Eee-Oh-A-Whoa-Oh.

MINERVA

Everybody here, in Rome, wishes

you tinsel boxes of love...

KAPLAN

Lazy, rich, condescending bitch.

ALEX

Eighth room down, babe...

ANNA

Guards come exactly every three

minutes....

HAWK

Three.  Oh.  Oh.  "Side by Side."

HAWK

"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of

money.

ALEX

"Maybe we're ragged and funny."

HAWK AND ALEX

"But we'll travel along, singing

a song.  Side by Side..."

KAPLAN

Create a diversion.

ALEX

Now that's a lock.

HAWK

Don't worry, we'll get it...

ANNA

Can I sing this time, too?

Please?

HAWK

Uh, I guess so.

DARWIN

I look at you Soviet people and I

feel... pity... superiority.  Most

of your life, your government has

told you that Capitalism turns

people into robots who'd rather

eat microwave sushi, naked in the

back of a Cadillac than hear the

laughter of children.

MINERVA

(smiling)

We're here to say, your government

was right.

DARWIN

So let's get busy.  Have some fun

and make some deals.

HAWK

"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"

ALEX

"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"

ANNA

"But we'll travel the road, Sharing

the load.  Side by Side!"

SNICKERS

This is the room above the Art

Treasures room.  The lock is a

Natalya Z-Z, first created...

ALMOND JOY

Snickers, baby, I love you like a

brother, but really, who cares?

Silencer bomb...

HAWK

That was close....

ALEX

Anna, I think you better stay....

HAWK

You can be lookout!.....  Take

Alex's gun.

ANNA

"You can be the lookout."

SOVIET LEADER

Before we serve you "the main course,"

hee, hee, we need to know specifics

about what you can do for us.  We--

DARWIN

Bluntness.  How amusingly Hungarian.

Listen up, for reasons I don't want

to get into, I recently had to close

down a petroleum factory, but I'm

going to re-build it here and

Madonna's going to cut the ribbon!

Frozen burritos in Leningrad.  1982

fantasy.  1992 reality.

HAWK

"We all had our quarrels and

parted..."

ALEX

"But we'll be the same as we started...

HAWK AND ALEX

"Just traveling along, singing a

song.  Side--"

HAWK

Geez, this place is a mess...

ALEX

Voila...

ALEX

Side by side, man...

ALMOND JOY

What the hell....

SNICKERS

You're supposed to be dead!

ALEX

I'm a ghost.  Boo.

HAWK

I don't want to sound immature,

but we were here first...

KAPLAN

I wish I could think of those cute

quips the way you can, Hawk, but

I can't, so I'll just shoot Alex.

HAWK

No....

ALMOND JOY

That was pretty uncool, George...

KAPLAN

Sorry, you know he kind of reminds

me of Little Eddie.  But I digress.

Ah, victory is so sweet....

MINERVA

Yum.  This is the best meal I

ever had...

KAPLAN

Damnit, this isn't the plan!

Blue light, green light, shit!

Snickers, Kit Kat, A.J., scramble,

see if you can find out anything.

HAWK

Can't you see the Mayflowers

double-crossed you...

KAPLAN

They may be scum, but if I get the

Da Vinci model back, then we'll be

roasting weenies on the beach.

HAWK

I don't think you'll appreciate

their choice of weenie.

DARWIN

You're helping us achieve a goal

and in return, I'm giving you a

key to the world's executive

washroom.  Don't piss it away....

Skoal, amigos...

ANNA (O.S.)

Stop or I'll shoot.

ANNA

You people are immoral and

narcissitic and I won't let you...

KAPLAN

I can't believe this.  I'm in

fucking Russia, or do I have to

say, the fucking Soviet Union and

I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.

(raising back up

his gun)

I never thought I'd say "I'm just

in this job for the money."  Sad.

Any last immature quips?

HAWK

No.

(a beat)

But why do you let Butterfinger

keep those blood stains on his

shirt?

BUTTERFINGER

What blood stains....

HAWK

You want immature, how 'bout an

egg fight...

HAWK

Alex, are you....

ALEX

I can't believe you didn't notice.

My weight.  I lost ten pounds in

Rome

HAWK

You're a reed, man.  I gotta get

Anna.  Hang in there...

ALMOND JOY

Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I

have to cut out your heart for

real now.  It's not personal.

ALMOND JOY

You won't shoot.  I read your

dossier... Sister.

ALMOND JOY

I gotta get a new job...

ANNA

The Mayflowers got...

DARWIN

What a pleasant surprise.  You're

probably wondering...

HAWK

But you're going to tell us

anyway...

MINERVA

I hate a man with a sense of

humor.  While you corn dogs were

comparing the lengths of your

masculinity, we obtained the

helicopter the new fashioned

way: a thoroughly corrupt business

deal.

HAWK

If you think you're getting past

me...

HAWK

Don't be stupid...they...

SNICKERS

Bastard!  If you were a true

American.

HAWK

Just shut up and hit me!

DARWIN

Alfred, the getaway car...

HAWK

Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat

burglar!  Nobody said anything

about this fight-to-the-death

shit.

SNICKERS

Too bad.

MINERVA

I knew it!  I told you it was a

fake.

DARWIN

That New-York-Italian-Father-

made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son-

of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A

million?

MINERVA

Million five, lover...

SNICKERS

Help me you Democratic Reform

lovers!  Get a screwdriver, you

Stupid Eskimoes!  Screw-dri-ver!

Oh God, I always wanted to know

how to play the harp, there

just was so little time!  Rosebud!

SNICKERS

Maybe it was just a....

ALEX

Get 'em.  They went down the

hallway.

HAWK

Let's just forget it, I mean...

ALEX

Get em....

MINERVA

Alex.  How's it going?

ALEX

Go, go to Hell, to Hell.

MINERVA

Where's your insulin....No?  Well,

Bon Appetite.

HAWK

Oh, come on....

MINERVA

Very good, Alex, but you re

still alive....

MINERVA

That's fair.

HAWK

Why does this have to be so hard...

KAPLAN

Tell me about it...

HAWK

Take this to Hell with you...

KAPLAN

My pension.....

DARWIN

God-damnit, I only wanted to

destroy the world in my own image.

I'm a regular Joe...

DARWIN

Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin.  God,

let's talk abut this.

HAWK

Wow, this is really gonna hurt the

resale value...

HAWK

Oh, honey....

HAWK

We did it man, we...

ANNA

Oh Hudson...

HAWK

I told you not to call me Hudson.

The only people who called me that

were the nuns at...

ANNA

Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the

Catholic church as well as an

agent.

HAWK

(cut-off laugh)

This is too bad to be false.

ALFRED

Welcome back to Vinci.

HAWK

Last rites, sister?

ANNA

Please, no nun jokes...They're a

bad habit to get into....get it?

HAWK

She killed Alex.

MINERVA (O.S.)

GOLD-FI-ING-ER!

MINERVA

Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You're

probably wondering why you're

still alive.  Anna.....

MINERVA

I want you to monitor the Da

Vinci's directions from the

apprentice diary.  And Hawk, I

didn't want you to go to hell

without knowing that Darwin and

I's dream came true.

(suddenly sheepish)

Beside that, none of us can seem

to put that damn crystal together.

Alfie and I were up all night with

the thing.

HAWK

You killed a friend.  Why should I

help you go for the gold?

MINERVA

It'll take a couple of years of

steady production, but I'll flood

the market with so much gold that

gold itself, the foundation of all

finance, will lose its meaning.

Brokers, economists, and fellow

entrepreneurs will drown in the

saliva of their own nervous

breakdowns.  Markets will crash-

crash.  Financial Empires will

crumble-crumble.

HAWK

Except yours-yours.  The goal of

world domination.  Well, if you

put it that way, Minnie.  How can

I resist?

MINERVA

You can't, convict!  You're just

a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the

fantasy the planet revolves around

them.  It rains, car crash stops

traffic, you say "How could this

happen to me?"  It's a natural

inclination.  But for I, this

isn't a fantasy, it is

reality

!

You are on my planet!  You walk

around the corner for coffee, out

of my sight, you do not fucking

exist!  The lives of shmoes like

you have meaning only in relation

to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

ANNA

Do it.  There's no reason to fight

anymore.  She's a force of nature.

MINERVA

If you pull this off, I can't

promise I won't kill you.  I mean,

who we trying to kid?  But I will

spare the Flying Nun here....

HAWK

And to think I thought you were

Evil Incarnate in pumps.

MINERVA

I killed some lovable working

class Italian-diabetic, but you

killed the most significant male

figure of the decade and a kind,

gentle lover.  So don't play with

me.

HAWK

Okay, fine!

MINERVA

Oh Hawk, don't ever change.  Go,

team, go!

HAWK

I hope you know what....

ANNA

Trust Leonardo....

HAWK

Wha.....

MINERVA

(into the headset)

We're for real.

ANNA

Da Vinci made the real directions

in a secret script that I decoded.

The way the machine is running

now, the gold will produce too

quickly, clog, and the machine

will shut itself down.  Isn't it

wonderful?

HAWK

Yeah, but what would happen if that

little mirror came out of the

crystal.

ANNA

Wha -- you don't want to know...

HAWK

I wanna know...

ANNA

Holy sh-h--things are going to

get very interesting, very fast.

Da Vinci would be proud of you.

MINERVA

Eureka, motherfuckers!

HAWK'S VOICE (head-set)

Minnie, hate to interrupt your

orgasm, but....

HAWK

Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna

say you got the Midas touch, baby...

ALFRED

How.

HAWK

You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss

is dead.  Her plan is over.

ALFRED

(strange voiced)

My plan is just beginning.  I'll

forgive you for denying me the

pleasure of slaughtering my

boorish employers, but I'm afraid

the birth of the new British

Empire can have no witnesses!

HAWK

Ooh-kay...

ANNA

Sorry!

HAWK

Stop helping me!  Thou shalt not

kill!

Alfred's

throat which

HAWK

Don't lose your head over this.

HAWK

Excuse my crass American humor.

ANNA

Allow me.

HAWK

Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.

JUGGLER

Che pazzo....

HAWK

Have I ever told you the world is

beautiful...

(semi-seductively)

I'd really like to play

Nintendo with you, or something...

ANNA

Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking

with God.

(smiling)

But you're a close second, tough

guy.  What is that smile?

HAWK

(broadly grinning)

I got my planet back.

HAWK

The first one's for Alex.  Cheers.

FADE OUT.

THE END
