FATHER'S VOICE (TOM)

Where's my wallet?!

SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY (TODD)

YOU IDIOT!!

TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL (KIMBERLY)

MOM!

TODD

SHUT-UP!

EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL (JEANIE)

I NEED A TOWEL!!

TOM

JOYCE!

KIMBERLY

(whispers, sadistic)

When you turn ten, your head's going

to swell up real big like a watermelon

and we're going to have to put you

to sleep like they do with a dog.

TODD

MOM!

TOM

JOYCE!!

JEANIE

WHO PISSED ON THE TOILET SEAT!? MOTHER!!

TOM

Where's Mom?

TODD

Is my head going to swell up?

TOM

What?!

JEANIE

OH, MY GOD! THE TOILET PAPER'S ALL WET!!!

MOTHER (JOYCE)

(screams)

TOM!

TODD

What's that?

KIMBERLY

Wait! Hold still!

TODD

What?!

KIMBERLY

You heads starting to swell up!!

TOM

(breathless)

What's the matter?

JOYCE

(worried)

It's Ferris!

TOM

What's wrong?

JOYCE

(snaps)

What's wrong? For Christ's sake!

Look at him!

TOM

Ferris?

JOYCE

He doesn't have a fever. But he says

his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.

5  INT. BEDROOM. PARENTS                                         5

TOM

What's the matter, Ferris?

JOYCE

Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy.

TOM

(discreetly)

Should you call the doctor?

JOYCE

(whispers)

He doesn't want me to.

TOM

Why don't you want Mom to call

the doctor?

TOM

What?

FERRIS

(raspy)

Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.

FERRIS

I have a test today. I have to take it.

I want to get into a good college

so I can have a fruitful life...

JOYCE

You're not going to school like

this.

(to Tom)

Maybe I should call the office and

tell them I won't be in.

FERRIS

I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!

JEAN

Oh, fine. What's this? What's his problem?

JOYCE

He doesn't feel well.

JEAN

Yeah, right. Dry that one out

and you can fertilize the lawn.

TOM

That's enough, Jeanie.

JEANIE

You're not falling for this, are you?

Tell me you're not falling for this.

FERRIS

Is that Jeanie? I can't see that

far. Jeanie?

JEANIE

Pucker up and squat, Ferris.

JOYCE

(annoyed)

Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school.

JEANIE

(angry, defeated)

You're really letting him stay home?

I can't believe this. If I was bleeding

out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to

school. It's so unfair.

FERRIS

Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie.

Be thankful that you're fit and have

your health. Cherish it.

JEANIE

(to herself)

Oh, I wanna puke.

KIMBERLY

Myocardial infarction?

JOYCE

Get your stuff. Daddy'll be right

down.

KIMBERLY

Syphilitic meningitus? That would be

a huge family embarrassment.

TOM

Get downstairs!

KIMBERLY

If he dies, I got dibs on his stereo.

TODD

(worried)

Dad? Does my head look alright?

JOYCE

Get downstairs! Now!

TODD

Just answer me one question! Is it

swelling up? Kim said it was going

to get as big as...

KIMBERLY (OC)

A WATERMELON!

TODD

(yells out the room)

Shut-up!

JOYCE

Get downstairs! NOW!

FERRIS

I'll be okay. I'll just sleep.

Maybe I'll have an aspirin around

noon.

JOYCE

(to Ferris)

I'm showing houses to the family

from California today but I'll be in

the area. My office'll know where

I am, if you need me.

TOM

I'll check it with you, too.

FERRIS

It's nice to know I have such

loving, caring parents. You're

both very special people.

JOYCE

I hope you feel better, pumpkin.

TOM

Get some rest.

8  CU. FERRIS                                                    8

JOYCE (OC)

We love you, sweetie.

TOM (OC)

Call if you need us.

FERRIS

They bought it.

9  CU. TV SCREEN                                                 9

10  INT. BEDROOM                                                 10

FERRIS

Incredible! One of the worst performances

of my career and they never doubted it

for a second.

(looks out the window)

What a beautiful day!

FERRIS

Parents always fall for the clammy hands.

It's physical evidence of illness. It's

a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are

generally pretty hip to the fever scams.

And to make them work you have to go a hundred

and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous

mother and you end up in a doctor's office

and that's worse than school.

FERRIS

Fake a stomach cramp and when you're

doubled over, moaning and wailing, just

lick your palms. It's a little stupid

and childish but then so if high school.

Right?

FERRIS

This is my ninth sick day with semester.

If I go for ten, I'm probably going to

have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely

must make this one count.

11  INT. BATHROOM                                                11

FERRIS

I don't care if you're fifty five

or seven, everybody needs a day off

now and then. It's a beautiful day.

How can I be expected to handle

high school?

FERRIS

I do actually have a test. That wasn't

bullshit.

FERRIS

That I care about it was.

12  INT. BATHROOM. SHOWER STALL.                                 12

FERRIS

It's on European socialism. I mean,

really. What's the point? I'm not

European. I don't plan to be European.

So, who gives a shit if they're socialists?

They could be fascist anarchists and it

still wouldn't change the fact that I

don't own a car.

FERRIS

(sings)

WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY,

TWIST AND SHOUT...

13  INT. HALLWAY. LATER                                          13

FERRIS

Not that I condone fascism. Or

and "isms". "Isms", in my opinion

are not good. A person should not

believe in an "ism". He should

believe in himself. John Lennon

said it on his first solo album.

"I don't believe in Beatles, I

just believe in me." A good point

there. Afterall, he was the Walrus.

FERRIS

I could be the Walrus and I'd still

have to bum rides off people.

FERRIS (OC)

I'm not very political? Let me

put that into perspective...

14  INT. BEDROOM                                                 14

FERRIS

My uncle went to Canada to protest

the war, right? On the Fourth of

July he was down with my aunt and he

got drunk and told my Dad he felt

guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam.

So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle

Jeff? In wartime you want to be a

pacifist and in peacetime you want

to be a soldier. It took you twenty

years to find out you don't believe

in anything?"

(snaps his fingers)

Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks.

(pause)

Be careful when you deal with old

hippies. They can be real touchy.

15  INT. CLOSET                                                  15

FERRIS

My mother was a hippie. But she

lost it. She got old. If she listens

to the White Album now? She doesn't hear

music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is

her favorite drug. It'll probably be

mine, too. I hope not.

16  INT. BEDROOM                                                 16

FERRIS

In eighth grade a friend of mine

made a bong out of one of these.

The smoke tasted like glue.

FERRIS

His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a

serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I

like him. I'm probably his only friend.

I do what I can for him. I mean, if

I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others,

right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.

His father's dead and his sister's rumored

to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit.

She only puts out so people will hang out

with her. It's sad but I don't hold it

against her. Better to hold it against the

guys who use her and don't care about her.

(pause)

My parents never allowed Garth over here.

It was because of his family. Mainly his

older brother. He's in jail. I could see them

not wanting his brother here because he is

a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.

I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of

artificial fruit just so he could see what

it was like to have his stomach pumped.

But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault

that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights

with the parents on that point. I always felt

for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once

and I was laying on the dark worrying that

his brother was going to come in and hack me

to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.

I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing".

... Nothing was wrong. There was no

specific thing he was crying about.

In fact, he wasn't really even aware that

he was crying. He just cried himself to

sleep every night. It was a habit. The

guy's so conditioned to grief that if

he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How

could you possibly dump on guy who has to

deal with that kinda shit? My parents

acknowledge the trudge of the situation

and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel

for him but still the guy's banned from

our house.

FERRIS

Unfortunately, now my parents have a

legit argument. Garth doesn't need his

brother to give him a rep anymore. He's

getting one on his own. He's lost. It's

over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from

school. Gone from life. His legacy is

a gas station.

17  INT. HOUSE. STAIRCASE                                        17

FERRIS

One very serious danger is playing

sick is that it's possible to believe

your own act.

18  INT. KITCHEN                                                 18

FERRIS

That and boredom. Alot of people

ditch and feel great for about an

hour. Then they realize there's

nothing to do. TV and food. I myself

have ditched and gotten so bored I

did homework. Figure that shit out.

FERRIS

You have to plan things out before

you take the day off. Otherwise

you get all nervous worrying about

what to do and all you get is grief

and the whole point is to take it

easy, cut loose and enjoy.

FERRIS

You blow your day and at about three

o'clock, when everybody's out of school,

you're going to wish you'd gone to

school so you could be out having

fun.

FERRIS

Avoid the misery. Plan your day.

Do it right.

19  INT. FAMILY ROOM                                             19

FERRIS

There's alot of pressure at work

in my age group. And it's not always

recognized.

FERRIS

Some guy whose hair is falling out

and his stomach's hanging over his

belt and everything he eats makes

him fart, he looks at someone like

me and thinks, "This kid's young and

strong and has a full, rich future ahead

of him, what's he got to bitch about?"

20  CU. PHONE                                                    20

21  INT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS                                     21

FERRIS

That's just one reason why I need a

day off every now and then.

22  EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE                                           22

23  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                           23

CAMERON

Food...shelter...no...yes...

CAMERON

(weak)

Hello?

FERRIS' VOICE

Cameron! What's happening?

CAMERON

Very little.

FERRIS' VOICE

How do you feel?

CAMERON

Shredded.

FERRIS' VOICE

Is your mother in the room?

CAMERON

She's not home. Where are you?

FERRIS' VOICE

Home.

24  INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS                             24

FERRIS

I'm taking the day off. Get

dressed and come over.

CAMERON'S VOICE

I can't. I'm sick.

FERRIS

It's all in your head. Come on over.

25  INT. CAMERON'S ROOM                                          25

CAMERON

I feel like complete shit, Ferris.

I can't go anywhere.

FERRIS' VOICE

I'm sorry to hear that. Now, come

on over and pick me up.

CAMERON

I'm dying.

FERRIS' VOICE

You're not dying. You just can't think

of anything good to do.

26  INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM                                     26

FERRIS

If anybody needs a day off, it's

Cameron. He has alot of things to

sort out before he graduates. He

can't be wound this tight and go

to college. His roommate'll kill

him. I've come close myself. But I

like him. He's a little easier to

take when you know why he's like he

is. The boy cannot relax. Pardon

by French but Cameron is so tight

that if you stuck a lump of coal up

his ass, in two weeks you'd have a

diamond.

(after-thought)

And Cameron would worry that he'd

owe taxes on it.

27  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         27

BOY'S VOICE

Here.

TEACHER'S VOICE

Busch?

Here.

TEACHER'S VOICE

Bueller?

TEACHER'S VOICE

Bueller?

GIRL'S VOICE

He's sick.

(pause)

My best friend's sister's boyfriend's

brother's girlfriend heard from this

guy who knows this kid who's going

with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out

at 31 Flavors last night. I guess

it's pretty serious.

TEACHER'S VOICE

(weary)

Thank you, Simone.

GIRL'S VOICE

(cheery)

No problem whatsoever.

TEACHER'S VOICE

Drucker?

BOY'S VOICE

What?

28  CU. TV                                                       28

29  CU. FLOWERING TREE BRANCH                                    29

FERRIS

This is really degrading.

FERRIS

Financing my activities this way.

Very damaging to the self-image.

But, hey, I'm broke. In times of

crisis one must to what one must

to. I'll pay it back. With interest.

FERRIS

Regardless of how much shit sisters

make you eat, how often they rat on

you, how gross they act or how wicked

and insensitive they can be, you should

not alientate them. Because most likely

they have cash and it's usually very easy

to get your hands on.

JOYCE

No one's going to consider a

house with a black living room.

Not even those jerks from Vermont.

Let's be realistic.

AGENT 1

Mrs. Volbeck's dead set against

putting any money into the house.

JOYCE

Joyce Bueller.

JOYCE

Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I

completely forgot to call.

in school today?

49  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         49

JOYCE'S VOICE

Yes, I am. Ferris is home sick. I

had a meeting first thing this

morning. I should have called. It

completely slipped my mind.

50  INT. SCHOOL. DEAN'S OUTER OFFICE                             50

DEAN'S VOICE

Are you also aware that Ferris does not

have what we consider an exemplary

attendance record?

51  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. CU. DESK SIGN                            51

JOYCE'S VOICE

I don't understand.

DEAN'S VOICE

I just had his file up.

ROONEY

I just has his file up, Mrs. Bueller.

ROONEY

If Ferris thinks he coast this last

month and still graduate, he's sorely

mistaken.

JOYCE'S VOICE

This is all news to me.

ROONEY'S VOICE

So far this semester alone, he's been

absent nine times. Including today.

JOYCE'S VOICE

Nine times?

ROONEY

I have it right here in front of me. He's

missed...

52  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            52

FERRIS

I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's

that for being born under a bad sign?

53  INT. JOYCE'S OFFICE                                          53

JOYCE

I can give you every assurance that

Ferris is home and that he is, in

fact, very ill. I debated whether

or not I should even leave him.

I can appreciate that at this time

of year children are prone to taking

the day off, but in Ferris' case,

he's truly a very sick boy.

GIRL

I'm really sorry about your brother.

JEANIE

What're you sorry for? I have to live

with the trouser snake.

GIRL

No, I mean I heard he's really sick.

JEANIE

Who said he's sick.

GIRL

A whole bunch of people. They said

he's like on the verge of death.

GIRL

This guy in my biology class said

that if Ferris dies he's giving

his eyes to Stevie Wonder? He's

really sweet isn't he?

57  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            57

FERRIS

A sample of my blood was sent

to Atlanta to the Center for

Disease Control. I don't know,

man, I'm bricking heavily.

(point to the

phone)

Freshman.

(to the phone)

Did you see Alien? When the guy

had the creature in his stomach?

It feels like that.

58  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         58

BOY

Goddamn! Are you kidding?

SECOND BOY

What?

BOY

Did you see Alien?

SECOND BOY

No.

BOY

You never rented the video cassette?

BOY

Oh. He's really wasted.

THIRD BOY

(to the Second Boy)

Who's he talking to?

SECOND BOY

Ferris Bueller. You know him?

THIRD BOY

(excited)

Yeah. He's getting me out of summer

school.

BOY

Anyway, I appreciate you letting us

know how you're doing. We gotta split.

(pause)

Huh?...Yeah, sure. Hold on.

SECOND BOY

(to Third Boy)

I can't handle summer school.

Did you see Alien?

Yeah, why?

Hello?

Hi, Ferris. How's your bod?

Oh, my God! You're dying?

Is it serious?

Shiit! Are you upset?

ROONEY

I don't trust this kid any further

than I can throw him!

SECRETARY

With your bad knee, you better

not throw anybody, Ed.

ROONEY

What's so dangerous about a character

like Ferris Bueller is that he gives

the good kids bad ideas. The last thing

I need at this point in my career is

fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples

running around these halls.

SECRETARY

He's very popular, Ed. Sportos, motorheads,

geeks, sluts, pinheads, dweebies, wonkers,

richies, they all adore him.

ROONEY

That's exactly why I have to catch him

this time. To show these kids that the

example he sets is a first class ticket

to nowhere.

SECRETARY

(impressed)

Ooo. You sounded like Dirty Harry just

now.

ROONEY

Really?

to have the shits? Try to barf?

with this stuff.

got another call.

Sure, pal. Are you alright?

FERRIS

Just a little phlegm on the phone.

Hold on.

FERRIS

Cameron? It's my Dad.

CAMERON'S VOICE

Oh, that's just great. Are you busted?

FERRIS

It's completely cool. He's just

checking up on me. Now, listen to

me. I'm working on getting some

heavy bucks out of him. So, the least you

can do is hurry up and get over here.

Bye.

FERRIS

Sorry, Dad. The moment before you

called, I had a chest spasm and I

blew lung fluid all over the place.

It was making me ill looking at it.

But gee, it's sure great of you to call.

I'm sure there're alot of fathers

who wouldn't take time out from

their busy schedules to call a dumb,

sick teenager.

TOM'S VOICE

Hey, pal, what was I supposed to do?

FERRIS

Give yourself some credit, Dad. It

was a mammoth gesture. It's like those

savings bonds you used to give me

every Christmas.

(looks at CAMERA and smiles)

It was that kind of concern.

FERRIS

You had to work hard for the money

to buy those things, right?

TOM'S VOICE

Not any harder than anybody else.

even remember where those bonds are,

right?

TOM'S VOICE

Wrong.

FERRIS

Oh, yeah? You're pulling my leg. You're

just trying to cheer me up.

TOM'S VOICE

Like hell I am. They're in a shoebox

in my closet.

FERRIS

(to CAMERA, normal

voice)

Was that a class move or what?

The guy gave it up faster than

a drunk Catholic girl. I hope my

kids don't pull this shit on me.

(thinks)

Of course, if they didn't, they'd

be dumb and abnormal and they'd

probably never move out of my

house and I'd have to support them

until I die. I take it back.

(to the phone,

sick voice)

Dad? All this talking has made me

kind of light-headed. I think

I better lie down.

TOM'S VOICE

Okay, pal. You take care. I'll

call you after lunch.

FERRIS

You don't have to, Dad.

I want to. Bye now.

about it.

get caught. Ferris'll escape.

Cameron'll go on like that for a

good thirty minutes. The guy

is a shellfish when it comes to

making a decision. The reason

he doesn't fell good is, he

worries about everything. He's

the only guy I know who's deeply

concerned that when he grows up

there'll be a critical shortage

of strategic metals.

herself. I don's want anyone around...

suspicious! He'll think something's

How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's

going to be there with her?!

I said for her to be there alone

and you freaked!

My, God, you're so stupid!

I didn't hit you, I lightly slapped

you.

CAMERON

You hit me. Look, don't ask me to

participate in your crap if you

don't like the way I do it!

CAMERON

I was home, sick. You get me out of

bed, being me over here, make me

jeopardize my future, make me do

a phoney phone call on a dean of

students, a man who could squeeze

my nuts into oblivion and then

you deliberately hurt my feelings.

I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.

You did screw up through, right?

Not that is was necessarily all

you fault. Right?

CAMERON

(grim monotone)

1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California. Less

than a hundred were made. It has a

market value of $265,000. My father

spent three years restoring it. It

is joy, it is his love, it is his

passion.

FERRIS

It is his fault he didn't lock the

garage.

CAMERON

Ferris, my father loves this car more

than life itself. We can't take is out.

FERRIS

A man with priorities so far out of

whack doesn't deserve such a fine

automobile.

CAMERON

He never drives it, Ferris. He just

rubs it with a diaper.

FERRIS

We can't pick up Sloane in your car,

Cameron. Rooney'd never believe Mr.

Peterson drives that piece of shit.

CAMERON

It's not a piece of shit.

FERRIS

It's a piece of shit. Don't worry

about it. I don't even have a piece

of shit. I have to envy yours. Look,

I'm sorry but there's nothing else

we can do.

CAMERON

He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has

it tatooed on his wrist.

FERRIS

He doesn't trust you?

CAMERON

No.

FERRIS

Alright, look, this is real simple.

FERRIS

Whatever miles we put on it, we'll

take off.

CAMERON

(suspicious)

How?

FERRIS

(big, proud smile)

We'll drive home backwards.

Forget it. I'm putting my foot down,

This is the world's tallest building.

From our vantage point here on the

103 floor, we are provided with a

view of four states.

CAMERON (VO)

Do you think the car's alright?

FERRIS (VO)

Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and

my personal favorite, Indiana.

CAMERON

I don't feel good, Ferris. Are

we gonna stay long?

FERRIS

Take a step back...

FERRIS

Now, lean against the glass. Like

this...

FERRIS

And look down.

SLOANE

Oh, shit!

SLOANE

What if the glass gives?

FERRIS

Death.

SLOANE

Cool.

CAMERON

I think I see my Dad.

BACK IN THE STATES

SLOANE

Do you love me?

FERRIS

Do you love me?

SLOANE

I asked you first.

FERRIS

Yes. You?

SLOANE

Yes.

FERRIS

Would I trash a day of education to

be with you if I didn't love you?

SLOANE

Yes.

FERRIS

Would I risk damaging a deep and

wonderfully enriching relationship

with my parents if I didn't love you?

SLOANE

Yes.

FERRIS

Would I have introduced you as my wife

if I didn't love you?

SLOANE

Wait a minute. That was a lie.

FERRIS

True.

FERRIS

Would you want to get married? I

mean if I wasn't an asshole.

SLOANE

Sure.

FERRIS

(serious)

Today?

FERRIS

I'm game.

SLOANE

No way!

FERRIS

I'll do it, if you will.

CAMERON

You need a blood test.

FERRIS

Huh?

CAMERON

If your blood's not compatible,

you could produce a pinhead. The

state requires a blood test.

FERRIS

So?

CAMERON

So, you can't get married today.

FERRIS

Tomorrow?

CAMERON

If you get a blood test today.

SLOANE

I'm not getting married.

CAMERON

I'm with you, babe.

FERRIS

Why not?

SLOANE

What do you mean, why not? Think

about it.

FERRIS

Besides being too young and your

father hating my guts and not

having any place to live and feeling

awkward about being the only cheer-

leader with a husband, give me a

good reason why not.

CAMERON

I'll give you two. My mother and

father.

CAMERON

They're married and they hate each other.

(to Ferris)

You've seen them. Am I right?

FERRIS

You're father's a toad and your

Mom's always wired out, but so what?

They're old. That's natural.

CAMERON

It makes me puke. Seeing people

treat each other like that. It's

like the car. He loves the car.

He hates his wife.

SLOANE

My parents are divorced. So what?

It's not like it doesn't happen

ten thousand times a day.

CAMERON

Just because it happens doesn't

make it right. Are you comfortable

with it?

SLOANE

No. It's not something I can get comfortable

with. I've tried. Are yours divorced?

CAMERON

They may as well be.

SLOANE

Do you think they're staying together

because of you?

SLOANE

Do they like you?

CAMERON

Yeah. Sure.

SLOANE

Consider this...my father canned me

and my brother and my Mom for a

twenty five year old dipso with fake

tits. He dropped us like a rock. Everything

was cool at our house. I thought so.

We all thought so. Then BLAM! It's over.

FERRIS

(to CAMERA)

This is all news to me. She keeps a

pretty good secret.

SLOANE

(to Cameron)

It was pure selfishness. When I have

a kid, I don't care how much I want

something, if it's gonna screw-up the

kid, forget it.

FERRIS

(to CAMERA)

She's not lying.

CAMERON

You could change.

SLOANE

Yeah. But I'm gonna try not to.

I'm gonna think about it. I'm

gonna try to prevent it.

FERRIS

This is optomism. It's a common

trait with my age group. Adults

think it's cute, it's like a charming

quick that infests youth. But it's

a cool thing and I think, deep down,

crusty old shits wish they had some.

They wish they had her, too.

(points to Sloane)

Sorry. She's taken.

CAMERON

I'd rather not have my family break

apart, thank you.

SLOANE

Well, you know what? It ain't up

to you. It's out of your hands.

CAMERON

So, I in other words, I should just

sit back and watch it crumble?

SLOANE

You're merely an inhabitant in their

universe.

FERRIS

Frightening choice of words.

SLOANE

They call the shots. When you split

from them, you call the shots.

CAMERON

So, you're saying I should run away?

FERRIS

No. She's saying it's time for lunch.

SLOANE

What?

FERRIS

Let's go feed Cameron.

FERRIS

BUY!

(to Ferris)

May I help you?

FERRIS

Yes. I'm Abe Frohman. Party of

three for 12:00.

FERRIS

Is there a problem?

MAITRE'D

You're Abe Frohman?

FERRIS

I'm Abe Frohman.

MAITRE'D

(chuckles)

I'm sorry, son. I'm very busy right

now. If you have trouble finding the

door...

FERRIS

Are you suggesting that I'm not

who I say I am?

MAITRE'D

Shall I call the police?

CAMERON

Let's go...Abe.

FERRIS

I'm not going anywhere.

(to the Maitre'd)

Call the police. Go ahead. Better

yet...

(grabs the phone)

...I'll call myself.

FERRIS

You touch me and I yell "rat!"

There's another phone around here.

Find it.

CAMERON

Ferris, let's split, please?

SLOANE

Cameron's right. We're gonna

get busted.

FERRIS

Not a chance in the world.

FERRIS

Ask for Abe Frohman.

MAITRE'D

I appreciate your understanding.

FERRIS

Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave

us to our repast and all will be

forgotten.

MAITRE'D

Enjoy your luncheon.

FERRIS

Thank you.

FERRIS

Darling, you were wonderful.

SLOANE

Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher.

FERRIS

Cameron, dear friend?

FERRIS

And you thought we wouldn't have

any fun. Shame on you.

122  INT. GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM                                     122

JEANIE

(mean, vicious)

I'm gonna bust his buns.

FRIEND

Why? What's the point?

JEANIE

Why? Because I'm sick of the little

dope. He manipulates my parents, he

does whatever he wants, whenever he

wants and he never gets nailed.

(wicked pause)

Well, babe, today I'm the hammer.

FRIEND

I think he's cute.

JEANIE

Sweetie, it's an established fact that

you have no taste. Ferris is not cute.

He's not charming. He's not nice. He's

not a wonderful person. He's an ignorant

mule and the sooner everybody in this

school comes to that realization the

better off we'll all be.

JEANIE

See? My brother strokes you, you

sympathize with him, I get pissed

off and this is what happens!

JEANIE

Let me tell you something. I study

hard, I work hard, I'm polite, I'm

considerate, I'm friendly and fair

to all kinds of people. Except

morons. I try to be everything a

good, decent person should be and

you know what?

FRIEND

Everybody thinks you're an asshole.

JEANIE

Excuse me?

FRIEND

I don't think you're an asshole.

JEANIE

Who does?

JEANIE

Rachel?

JEANIE

Rachel's a dirt bag. Who else?

FRIEND

I don't know. Just forget it.

JEANIE

Forget that everybody thinks I'm an

asshole? Would you like everybody to

think you're an asshole?

FRIEND

Not everybody thinks you're an

asshole. Mr. Rooney likes you.

JEANIE

Oh, hey. That's exciting. A fat

fifty year old clod with B.O.

likes me.

JEANIE

Would everybody be happier if

maybe I were to die in a flaming

car accident or something?

FRIEND

Maybe if you didn't cat like and

asshole...

JEANIE

Am I acting like an asshole?

FRIEND

I didn't mean it that way.

JEANIE

I this a conspiracy to shit all

over me or something? Is my brother

behind this? Tell me if he is or I'll

sock your tits.

FRIEND

You really do have a problem, Jeanie.

JEANIE

Me? I have a problem?

FRIEND

Somebody who threatens to sock people's

tits has a problem.

JEANIE

Alright. How about if I sock your

face?

FRIEND

Take a walk, Jeanie.

JEANIE

(yells after her)

If it means anything to you, I

have my period! MY BODY'S RIDDING

ITSELF OF OLD EGGS, GODDAMN IT!

JEANIE

He's gone. He's over. He's monkey meat.

123  INT. MEN'S ROOM. CHEZ PAUL                                  123

FERRIS

She's a person who views life as

an ordeal that must be endured. Her

body is a transport vehicle for her

anger. I don't know where she gets

this shit. Basically, the family's

pretty cool.

FERRIS

I wonder if everybody shoots at

cigarette butts in urinals? Probably

not many women.

(continues)

I used to think that my family was

the only one that had weirdness

in it. It used to worry me. Then I

met Cameron and I saw how his

family functioned.

FERRIS

Cameron's home life is really shit.

He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick

all the time. It really upsets him.

What he said about his parents hating

each other? I refuse to sleep over at

his house. His parents fight all the

time. Even when I'm there. Is there

anything worse than being at somebody's

house when their parents are fighting?

It's the absolute height of social

discomfort.

FERRIS

When they go after each other, Cameron

tightens up. It's scary. He gets so

wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns

apart with a crowbar. The thing with

taking his old man's car? It's good

for him. It teaches him to deal with

his fear. Plus, and I must

be honest here, I love driving it.

I highly recommend picking one up.

CAMERON

What is it?

SLOANE

I don't know. But it looks like

it's already been eaten and digested.

CAMERON

I knew it was a mistake letting

Ferris order for us.

FERRIS

What are you doing?

CAMERON

What is this shit?

FERRIS

You got me. I don't speak French.

FERRIS

I think it's a land-based beefoid

creature.

FERRIS

Splendid.

CAMERON

Really?

FERRIS

Superb.

FERRIS

Good?

FERRIS

Yo, Clouseau!

FERRIS

I have a growth on my brain that

causes memory lapses. Could you

tell me what we ordered here?

WAITER

Sweetbreads.

FERRIS

Uh, huh. And what might that be?

WAITER

Pancreas.

FERRIS

As in the gland that has important

functions in digestion and metabolism?

FERRIS

...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid

containing digestive enzymes? The home

of the world famous isles of Langerhans?

FERRIS

Check, please!

area and I pick the one my father

goes to.

No way, Cameron. Only the meek

get nabbed. The bold survive.

CAMERON (VO)

Are you guys worried about nuclear war?

FERRIS (VO)

Cameron, it's a beautiful day, we've

won our freedom, we're traveling down

one of American's most scenic polluted

waterways and you have to bring up

nuclear war?

SLOANE (VO)

It is kind of raggy subject, Cam.

CAMERON (VO)

Regardless. It's with us every day.

The possiblity of global destruction.

SLOANE (VO)

Don't you think it's an issue because

people need something to worry about?

They have to like, have some major

problem that puts all their little

bullshit into some kind of persepective?

CAMERON (VO)

Maybe.

FERRIS

They used to have Viet Nam. They

used to have the oil crisis stuff

and Iran. That's over and people

have to have their big issue. It's

not like somebody came up with the

nuclear holocaust yesterday at

noon, you know.

SLOANE (VO)

To answer your question...No, I'm not

worried about it at all.

FERRIS (VO)

We don't know when the bombs going

off. We do know, however, that college

starts in the fall.

CAMERON (VO)

(dramatic, deadly serious)

Do you know what a nuclear winter is?

SLOANE (VO)

Yeah. Everybody's dead, it's real

cold and the skiing's for shit.

SLOANE

My step-father's always going off about

how when he was young he was committed to

all these causes.

FERRIS

He's full of shit. All the old hippies

are full of shit.

SLOANE

He says I don't care about things like

he did.

FERRIS

What's he care about now?

SLOANE

Baldness, fatty meats and money.

FERRIS

I rest my case.

CAMERON

What's spooky is they still control

everything. They took over when they

were young and they never gave it up.

FERRIS

One of the most frightening experiences

of my young life has been observing

my parents and our neighbors playing

the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits.

It's chilling to see people crazed with

the minutia of their past.

CAMERON

It's human nature to like what you had

better than what you have.

SLOANE

Agreed.

but I'm starving.

Lean over and grab a fish.

What comes after a nuclear winter?

FERRIS

Nuclear spring.

for his own good. His cavalier

attitude will get him into trouble

later in life...and it'll continue

to piss me off and I'll get so

wadded-up that it'll cause cervex cancer

and he'll ruin my life. Screw him.

You want to leave? We just got here.

me put myself in a position where I

It's hard not to.

Stop...water...want...

SLOANE

Do you believe in reincarnation?

CAMERON

Huh?

SLOANE

Do you believe that you lived before?

CAMERON

Yeah. Sort of.

SLOANE

DO you ever wonder what you were?

CAMERON

I don't have to wonder. I know.

CAMERON

I was a tractor tire.

FERRIS

Guten tag, dude!

CAMERON

What were you in a previous life?

SLOANE

I'm not sure but I think I know

who Ferris was.

CAMERON

Hannibal.

SLOANE

From the A-Team?

CAMERON

No. The guy who rode the elephants

into Switzerland.

SLOANE

I think if he was anybody, he

was Magellan. You know, the guy

who went around the world.

SLOANE

I could see him ignoring popular

belief and taking off on some

impossible mission.

CAMERON

Yeah. As long as I've known him,

everything works for him. There's

nothing he can't handle. I can't

handle anything. School, parents,

the future. Ferris can do anything.

FERRIS

WELL, SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW!

SHAKE IT UP, BABY

FERRIS

TWIST AND SHOUT!

SLOANE

The future's worse for a boy, isn't

it?

SLOANE

A girl can always bail out and

have a baby and get some guy

to support her.

CAMERON

That's a pretty grim thought.

SLOANE

True, but it's an option. No options

is worse.

CAMERON

I don't know what I'm gonna do.

SLOANE

College.

CAMERON

Yeah, but to do what?

SLOANE

What are you interested in?

CAMERON

Nothing.

SLOANE

Me either.

do?

stopping by. I appreciate your concern

one way, one goes the other.

FERRIS

She's probably schizophrenic.

SLOANE

Ferris, this is nauseating me.

Really. I'm losing respect for

you by the bucket.

FERRIS

You don't think it's amazing that

we got in?

SLOANE

Who wants to get in?

FERRIS

Cameron looks like a toddler, for

Christ's sake. I'm talking about

a major achievement in false

identification.

SLOANE

I'm not interested in watching

someone jiggle their mammary glands.

FERRIS

Point well taken. But consider why

she does it. Why she does it and

you don't.

SLOANE

I'm not a tramp.

FERRIS

Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she

lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend.

A parent. A child...

(to CAMERA)

This kind of thing makes me a little

depressed. You may think because I'm

the age I am that I'm a sex maniac.

That sex is all I think about.

But that's not true. I'm a romantic.

I think alot of people my age are.

We think about love and matters of

the heart. And SAT scores and acne

aside, we worry about lonliness. It's

a terrible thing. And we feel it. I

feel it.

FERRIS

You know, someone said the world's a

stage and each must play a part.

Fate had me playing in love, with you

as my sweetheart. Act one was when we

met. I loved you at first glance. You

read your lines so cleverly and never

missed a cue. Then came act two. You

seemed to change. You acted strange.

And why, I've never known.

FERRIS

Honey, you lies when you said you

loved me and I had no cause to

doubt you. But I'd rather go on

hearing your lies than to go on

living without you. Now, the stage

is bare and I'm standing there with

emptiness all around and if you won't

come back to me, then they can bring

the curtain down...

ELVIS

IS YOUR HEART FILLED WITH PAIN?

SHALL I COME BACK AGAIN?

TELL ME DEAR, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?

So...

FERRIS

So, Yuri, how long have you been

in America?

DRIVER

One year.

FERRIS

What's your overall impression?

DRIVER

It's very good here.

FERRIS

Better than Russia?

DRIVER

Much better here than in Russia.

FERRIS

Clearly you've never been to an

American high school.

CAMERON

It's getting late, Ferris. I have

to get the car home. I know you

don't care, but it means my ass.

FERRIS

You think I don't care?

CAMERON

I know you don't care.

FERRIS

That hurts, Cameron.

SLOANE

Jump back, Ferris, Cameron's been

a good sport.

FERRIS

Cameron, what'd you see today?

FERRIS

You saw four states, a submarine,

a giant heart, seventy five dollars

worth of cooked pancreas, two of the

most incredible breasts ever to come

out of modern plastics, major

league baseball and...

(quizical look)

Are you gonna chuck your nachos?

FERRIS

(to Sloane)

What's he doing?

SLOANE

(revolted)

He's looking at me and he's licking

the glass and making obscene gestures

with his hands.

FERRIS

What?!

Roast!

your concern for my well-

As I heard it from our mailman

he was supposedly born with only

half a kidney.

FERRIS' VOICE

Have a nice day.

DELIVERY MAN

(to the intercom)

Thank you.

(continues)

I don't know the details. But my

boss had to send to Milwaukee to

get more orchids. He's very

popular.

Nobody's home here?

No.

DELIVERY MAN

You gonna be around for awhile?

ROONEY

I imagine so.

DELIVERY MAN

You wanna keep an eye on these?

D.J.

He has an incredible story.

FERRIS

I'm going to tell a massive lie here.

It's going to by very thick and very

steamy. I think radio's a facinating

medium, it challenges the imagination.

Unlike television which provides the

images, radio...

(pause)

You know this. Anyway, it's always been

a dream of mine to be on the radio.

I have what I consider to be an excellent

broadcast voice. I practise it in the

bathroom all the time. I used to play

records and do introductions to them.

But I've never had the chance to sit

behind a microphone and try it out

for real. This is a 50,000 watt outlet.

I'm going out to several million people

so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant

groove right now.

(clears his voice,

speaks into the

mike, affects a

"radio" voice)

Well, Steve, you and your listeners are

probably not going to believe this but...

FERRIS

I was going to say I knew Springsteen's

home phone number and I was going

to give out the number of the New

Jersey State Police but I thought I

might get busted. After I got flunked

in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail

box, which was not in any way, shape

or from my fault. I was putting out a

cigarette, like I was told. It was weird.

I'm so used to getting in a car and

lighting up, because I'm not allowed to

smoke at home, that I got in the driver's

ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out

of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller

looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny

out of my nose or something and I realized

what the hell I was doing and I went to

put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway,

I was so pissed off at her reaction to

the whole thing that I considered running

an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school

teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna

use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost

too much. I took it again and passed. But

I had to work at Burger King to get the

cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The

car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and

I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I

can't prove it? I'm in high school, remember?

D.J.

How did you get picked for this.

FERRIS

It's kind of a long story but I've

been doing alot of programming for

NASA.

I'd really like to but I have a kidney

up?

your age?

Twice.

like him.

Is he going up in the space shuttle

in September?

Not that I know of.

Watch your mouth.

How do you watch your mouth?

Very funny.

Cameron? How many miles did you

say this thing had when we left?

One hundred and twenty six and

halfway between three and four

tenths. Why? How many miles are

on it now?

Here's where Cameron goes berserk.

You okay?

Hey, Cameron. It's okay. We'll fix

it.

Cameron! Cut it out! What's

wrong?! Ferris!

Cameron, are you okay? It's

no problem, really. Your old

man won't know a thing. It's

completely fixable.

shut-up.

FERRIS

This may very well be for real. I

think Cameron might have blown a

micro-chip or two. He's always been

a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do

was give him a good day. We're

gonna graduate in a couple of months.

Then we have the summer. He'll work

and I'll work. And we'll see each

other at night and on the weekends

but then he'll go to one school and I'll

go to another. And basically that'll

be it. As much as we like each other,

the process of growing up will

separate us.

FERRIS

Sloane's a bigger problem. She still

has another year of high school. How

do I deal with that? I was serious when

I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't

just teenage infatuation. That's what my

parents call it. What do they call what they

have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation.

FERRIS (VO)

Cameron's never been in love. At

least no one's ever been in love

with him. He's gonna marry the first

girl he lays. And she's gonna treat

him like shit because he's gonna

kiss her ass for giving him what he's

built-up in his mind as the end-all,

be-all of human existance. She won't

respect him because you can't respect

someone who kisses your ass. It just

doesn't work.

SLOANE

Ferris?

FERRIS

I'm being tested here.

FERRIS

My best friend has flipped-out.

Conventional wisdom would suggest

a visit to the nearest trauma

center. I wouldn't fault anybody

for doing that. My, personally,

I think this calls for something

new, something bold, something wet

and wild.

of the car or is it a combination

of everything shitty in your life?

CAMERON

Music...kiss...attack...

FERRIS

You just can't deal with anymore

shit? The car took you into the

red zone? Time for a reality check?

SLOANE

Cameron? I could flip real easy, too.

There's nothing wrong with it. At one

time or another, everybody goes to

the zoo.

Maybe he was actually sick. Maybe

he wasn't bullshitting himself.

BOY

Yeah, I'm serious.

JEANIE

Blow yourself.

JEANIE

You really want to know what's wrong?

JEANIE

Alright. If you've got the time,

I've got the troubles. In a nutshell,

I hate my brother. How's that?

BOY

That's cool. Did you shoot him or

something?

JEANIE

No, not yet.

JEANIE

I went home to confirm that the

shithead was ditching school and

a guy broke into the house and I

called the cops and they picked me

up for making a phoney phone call.

BOY

What do you care if your brother

ditches school?

JEANIE

Why should he get to ditch school

when everybody else has to go?

BOY

You could ditch.

JEANIE

I'd get caught.

BOY

So, you're pissed at him because

he ditches and doesn't get caught?

JEANIE

Basically.

BOY

Then your problem is you.

JEANIE

Excuse me?

BOY

Excuse you. You oughta spend a little

more time dealing with yourself and

a little less time worrying about

to.

The whole time I was just thinking

things over. I was like, meditating.

I was thinking about the future.

And I realized it doesn't make

and difference if the present

goes to shit.

FERRIS

I have a agree with you there.

SLOANE

Really.

CAMERON

I've been thinking all day that if

you could only have the use of one

word, what would it be?

FERRIS

Sloane is naked before your eyes and

you're thinking about words?

SLOANE

God bless you, Cameron.

CAMERON

Thank you, Sloane.

CAMERON

If you guys only had one word, what

would it be?

FERRIS

I can't believe you'd think up something

like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi

right in front of you.

SLOANE

Come on, Ferris, answer his question.

FERRIS

Bathroom.

SLOANE

I'd say...

FERRIS

Cash.

CAMERON

It's the only word you could

ever use.

FERRIS

Hello.

SLOANE

Love.

FERRIS

And what is you loathe somebody?

Are you going to say "love" every

time you see them?

SLOANE

It's better than "hello".

FERRIS

Hellos' generic.

SLOANE

You wanna be generic?

CAMERON

It's help.

CAMERON

The word is help.

CAMERON

Ferris? It's not working.

CAMERON

The miles aren't coming off, running

it in reverse.

FERRIS

I thought that might be a problem.

Let's crack open the odometer and

roll it back by hand.

CAMERON

I got a better idea. It's cool.

CAMERON

Seventeen years and I've never

taken a stand. Now, I'm gonna

do it. I'm taking a stand against

my father, against my family,

against myself, against my past,

my present and my future. I will

not sit idly by as events that affect

me unfold to change the course of

my life. I will take a stand and I

will defend it. When my father comes

home tonight, he's finally going

to have to deal with me. Good or

bad, I'm taking a stand.

FERRIS

This is a big U-2 fan.

FERRIS

What was that about?

SLOANE

This has to be a dream.

FERRIS

Cameron? One quick question.

Why'd you do that?

FERRIS

You trashed the car.

SLOANE

Why?

CAMERON

I took a stand.

FERRIS

No, Cameron. You wrecked a car.

CAMERON

It's okay.

FERRIS

I have an idea. If you're interested.

CAMERON

I'm gonna handle it.

FERRIS

I think this could work.

CAMERON

No, thanks. I want to deal with

it by myself.

SLOANE

What about your one word?

CAMERON

You already did it. If I need it

again, I'll use it.

CAMERON

It's cool. I'm loose.

For whatever reasons she did it,

I think she'd had a good scare.

JOYCE

I hope so. I appreciate your calling

me. I can assure you that her father

and I will have a long talk with her.

JOYCE

Thank you.

OFFICER

Oh, by the way, I hope you son's

feeling better.

OFFICER

Tell him, all the guys at the

station here are pulling for

him.

JEANIE

(to the boy)

If you keep this to yourself, I

think we can probably get it on

pretty good.

BOY

For sure.

JEANIE

Hi.

JOYCE

Don't "hi" me, young lady. Get

your stuff.

BOY

What's your name?

JEANIE

Jean. What's yours?

BOY

Garth Volbeck.

SLOANE

I had a great time today.

FERRIS

Yeah. It was pretty cool.

SLOANE

You think Cameron's gonna be

alright?

FERRIS

Sure. He had to so it, I guess.

His old man had it coming. He'll

be okay. I'd be worried if he'd

taken my idea.

SLOANE

You didn't have an idea, did you?

FERRIS

Not a glimmer.

SLOANE

You're so smart.

FERRIS

No. I'm just real loose.

FERRIS

I'll call you tonight.

SLOANE

I LOVE YOU!

SLOANE

He's gonna marry me. I know it.

ROONEY

Looking for this?

FERRIS

Yes.

ROONEY

I got you, Ferris. This time I finally

got you.

ROONEY

How does another year of high

school sit with you?

JEANIE

Thank God, you're alright! We've

been worried sick!

JEANIE

(to Rooney)

Thank you for bringing him home,

Mr. Rooney.

(to Ferris)

You better get up in bed tight

now.

JEANIE

Can you imagine someone as sick as

Ferris trying to walk home from the

hospital?

(shakes her head)

Kids!

Ferris?  Does my head look like

it's getting bigger?

No, but Kimberly's is.

KIMBERLY

(to Todd)

Is he serious?

TODD

I think so.

KIMBERLY

Oh, shit!

FERRIS

Thanks, Jeanie.

No problem.

FERRIS

By the way, I borrowed some cash

from you. I'll pay you back.

JEANIE

You don't have to.

FERRIS

I want to.

You don't have to. I've been ripping

off your wallet for years.

Do you know a guy named Garth

Volbeck?

Vaguely.

JEANIE

Is he cool?

FERRIS

He's cool. But stay away from his

brother.

Honey?

Ferris? How do you feel?

150% better, thank you.

I'm much better, really. Please,

don't make me stay home again. I

want to go to school. I'm graduating

in June and I...

TOM

Ferris. You're sick. There's no point

pushing yourself and making it worse.

FERRIS

Maybe you're right, Dad.

TOM

I know I'm right.

JOYCE

How did you get so sweet?

FERRIS

Years of practice.

FERRIS

(happy sigh)

Yeah, life is a carousel. A

great big crazy ball of pure

living, breathing joy and delight.

FERRIS

You gotta get one.
