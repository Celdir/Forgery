1936

BARRANCA

(irritated)

They're talking about the Curse again!

INDY

No.

INDY

We don't need them.

BARRANCA

I do not carry supplies.

INDY

We'll leave them. Once we've got it,

we'll be able to reach the plane by

dusk.

SATIPO

(showing Indy)

The Hovitos are near. The poison is

still fresh... three days. They're

following us, I tell you.

INDY

If they knew we were here, they would

have killed us already.

INDY

So this is where Forrestal cashed

in.

SATIPO

A friend of yours?

INDY

Competitor. He was good, very good.

BARRANCA

(nervous)

No one has ever come out of there

alive. Why should we put our faith

in you?

INDY

No one ever had what we have...

partners.

INDY

(back turned)

Assuming that pillar there marks the

corner and...

SATIPO

I knew nothing! He was crazy! Please!

INDY

Let's go.

SATIPO

What's wrong? Are you lost?

INDY

Forrestal.

SATIPO

(gulps)

We can go no further.

INDY

Now, Satipo, we don't want to be

discouraged by every little thing.

INDY

(taking torch)

Let me see that.

INDY

Try not to touch the vines.

SATIPO

Senor, I think we are very close.

SATIPO

(impatient)

Let us hurry. There is nothing to

fear here.

INDY

That's what scares me.

SATIPO

There's plenty of light, amigo.

SATIPO

From that hole!

INDY

You wait here.

SATIPO

If you insist, senor.

SATIPO

No time to argue. Throw me the idol,

I throw you the whip.

SATIPO

You have no choice! Hurry!

SATIPO

Adios, amigo!

INDY

Adios.

BELLOQ

Dr. Jones, you choose the wrong

friends. This time it will cost you.

BELLOQ

And you thought I'd given up.

INDY

(eyeing the Hovitos)

Too bad they don't know you like I

do, Belloq.

BELLOQ

(smiles)

Yes, too bad. You could warn them...

if only you spoke Hovitos.

BELLOQ

(in Hovitos)

Kill him!

INDY

(yelling)

Get it going! Get it going!

INDY

GO!

JOCK

Don't mind him. That's Reggie.

Wouldn't hurt a soul.

INDY

I can't stand snakes.

JOCK

The world's full of them, you know.

INDY

I hate them.

JOCK

Come on now, Sport, show a little of

the old backbone.

BRODY

Do you think the idol will ever show

up?

INDY

I don't know. Just because Belloq

had it doesn't mean he kept it.

INDY

Getting it away from those Indians

would be a neat trick

(a hard look)

I hope they got him.

TEACHING ASSISTANT

I couldn't get the McNabe, Professor.

Someone's got it checked out 'til

next month when classes start.

INDY

That's all right, Phil. Thanks a

lot.

TEACHING ASSISTANT

(eager to please)

Will there be anything else?

INDY

No. I'll see you Thursday.

INDY

Hey, if you don't like them, I can

always return them.

BRODY

No, they're beautiful. The Museum

will buy them as usual. No questions

asked.

INDY

Then what's wrong?

BRODY

I brought along some people today.

INDY

What kind of people?

BRODY

Government.

INDY

(concerned)

Government?

BRODY

Don't worry, it's not about your

business.

(indicates the

artifacts)

They're from the Army.

INDY

I've already served.

BRODY

Army Intelligence. They're looking

for Abner.

MUSGROVE

But you did study under Professor

Ravenwood at the University of

Chicago?

INDY

(nods)

We haven't spoken in ten years. I'm

afraid we had a bit of a falling

out.

EATON

You know nothing of his whereabouts?

INDY

(negative)

Just rumors. Somewhere in Asia, last

I heard.

EATON

(to Musgrove)

Maybe Dr. Jones can make sense of

it.

MUSGROVE

Well... you must understand, Dr.

Jones, this is all strictly

confidential.

INDY

I understand.

MUSGROVE

Yesterday, one of our European

sections intercepted a Nazi communique

from Cairo to Berlin. We don't quite

know what to make of it.

MUSGROVE

Here it is - "Tanis development

proceeding. Acquire headpiece, Staff

of Ra, General Tengtu Hok, Shanghai.

Locate Abner Ravenwood, U.S."

BRODY

Tanis. They must have discovered the

lost ruins.

INDY

(to himself)

Tanis. Ain't that somethin'!

EATON

Frankly, we're a little suspicious...

An American being mentioned so

prominently in a secret Nazi cable.

INDY

Ah, Ravenwood's no Nazi.

EATON

Then what do they want him for?

INDY

They're looking for the headpiece to

the Staff of Ra.

MUSGROVE

(indicates his sheet)

But it says here that's in China.

INDY

Only half of it. Ravenwood had the

other half.

EATON

What would the Nazis want with this -

this Staff of Ra?

BRODY

I can tell you that. Over the last

two years the Nazis have had teams

of archeologists running around the

world looking for all kinds of

religious artifacts.

MUSGROVE

That's right. Hitler's a nut on the

subject. Crazy. He's obsessed with

the occult.

EATON

What is this Staff of Ra, anyway?

INDY

It all has to do with the Ark of the

Covenant.

(the Army guys look

mystified)

The chest the Hebrews used to carry

around the Ten Commandments.

INDY

An Egyptian pharaoh stole the Ark

from Jerusalem and took it back to

the city of Tanis. A short time later,

Tanis was consumed by the desert in

a sandstorm that lasted a year. But

before that, the Pharaoh had had the

Ark hidden away in a secret chamber

called the Well of the Souls. Which

is where the Staff of Ra comes in.

INDY

Now this was rather clever. The Staff

was really just a big stick - oh, I

don't know, say like this -

(he indicates about

six feet)

no one really knows for sure. Any

way, it was capped by an elaborate

headpiece with a carving of the sun

at the top. What you had to do was

take the Staff to a special map room

in Tanis - it had the whole city

laid out in miniature on the floor.

When you placed the Staff in a certain

spot in this room, at a certain time

of day, the sun would shine through

a hole here in the headpiece and

then send a beam of light down here -

to the map - giving you the location

of the Well of the Souls...

MUSGROVE

...where the Ark of the Covenant was

kept.

INDY

(nods)

Which is probably what the Nazis are

after.

EATON

What's this Ark look like?

INDY

Look like? Why, it's right here...

EATON

Good God!

INDY

Yes. That's what the Hebrews thought.

MUSGROVE

What's that supposed to be coming

out of there?

INDY

Who knows... lightning... fire...

the power of God.

EATON

I'm beginning to understand Hitler's

interest in this thing.

INDY

Oh yes. The Bible tells of it leveling

mountains and wasting entire regions.

Moses promised that when the Ark was

with you, "your enemies will be

scattered and your foes fell before

you".

(pause)

An army which carries the Ark before

it is invincible.

INDY

Oh, there's one other thing that

Hitler undoubtably believes about

the Ark...

(a long pregnant pause)

It's said that the Lost Ark will be

recovered at the time of the coming

of the True Messiah.

MUSGROVE

Dr. Jones, you've been very helpful.

I hope we can call on you again if

we have questions.

INDY

Most certainly.

BRODY

I've got to talk to you.

INDY

This isn't really a good time.

BRODY

Indy, it's important.

INDY

All right. Come on in.

INDY

I'll be in a minute.

BRODY

They want you to go for it. And

they'll pay.

INDY

(smiles)

Good work, Marcus. I had a feeling

this would happen. And, of course,

the Museum gets the Ark when we're

done.

BRODY

(smiles)

Of course.

INDY

Okay, here's the way it's gonna be.

First, I'll high-tail it to Shanghai

and get the piece from General Hok.

Then I think I know where I can find

Ravenwood. If only I can get -

BRODY

General Hok's a tough customer. They

don't call him the Wild Boar for

nothing. And he's tied in with the

Japanese.

INDY

I'll worry about that when the time

comes. My only hope is to find the

Well of the Souls before the Nazis

do.

WIPE TO:

WIPE TO:

KEHOE

Buzz Kehoe, Army Intelligence. You've

met Bang Chow.

INDY

What's the hurry?

KEHOE

Some German agents got here two hours

ago. Luckily, Bang was able to have

them detained at Customs. We'll have

to hurry.

KEHOE

Jesus! Are you all right!

INDY

(he's felt better)

Great. Got it.

KEHOE

What now?

INDY

I've got to get to Nepal.

WIPE TO:

WIPE TO:

SHERPA

Gmoiska! Shurga rintoik!

CLIMBER

Aye! That'll be your last word.

MARION

That does it! I've been patient with

you no-goods long enough. I'm not

open at 2 o'clock for myself, you

know. It's all for you. And how do

you repay me: Trouble and noise and

blood on my floor! I won't have it.

Everybody out! Out! Out! We're closed.

Closed! Do your killing outside! And

don't leave any bodies on the porch!

MARION

Hey you, deaf one! I said out of my

place. I don't mean next Easter, I

mean now -

INDY

Hello, Marion.

INDY

Nice to see you, too.

MARION

Get up and get out.

INDY

(getting up)

Take it easy. I'm looking for your

father.

MARION

(bitterly)

Well you're two years too late.

MARION

Go home, Mahdlo. I'll see you

tomorrow.

INDY

What happened?

MARION

Avalanche. Up there. He was digging.

What else? He spent his whole life

digging. Dragging me all over this

rotten earth. For what?

INDY

Do you find him?

MARION

Hell no. He's buried where he was

working. Probably preserved real

good, too. In the snow.

INDY

Not a bad way to go. Doing what he

loved.

MARION

(vitriolic)

Don't give me that stuff! What do

you know?

(she takes a drinks)

I'm the one that was left in a bad

way. He didn't have a penny. Guess

how I lived, Mister Jones. I worked

here. And I wasn't the bartender.

(another swallow)

Finally the guy that owned the joint

went crazy. Snow crazy. They took

his away screaming. As they dragged

him out, he said the place was all

mine for life.

MARION

Can you imagine a more evil curse?

(pause)

So far, it's working.

INDY

Why not leave? Go back to the States.

MARION

I'll go back. I'll get there. Not

that there's a soul there who knows

my name or cares. But I'll go. And

when I do, they'll know me. 'Cause

I'm going to go back in style. With

money. A goddamn lady!

INDY

Where you gonna get it?

MARION

If I knew that, you think I'd still

be running this dive?

MARION

I'll tell you something Indy. I've

learned to hate you in the last ten

years. But somehow, no matter how

much I hated you, I always knew that

someday you'd come through that door.

I never doubted that. Something made

is inevitable.

(hopefully)

Why are you here... now... tonight?

INDY

I need one of the pieces your father

collected.

MARION

You son-of-a-bitch! You know what

you did to me, to my life? This is

your handiwork.

INDY

I never meant to hurt you.

MARION

I was a child!

INDY

You knew what you were doing.

MARION

I was in love.

INDY

I guess that depends on your

definition.

MARION

It was wrong. You knew it.

INDY

Look, I did what I did. I don't expect

you to be happy about it. But maybe

we can do each other some good.

MARION

Why start now?

INDY

Shut up and listen for a second. I

want that piece your father had.

I've got money.

MARION

How much?

INDY

Enough to get you back to the States.

Where are his things?

MARION

Gone. I sold it all. It was all junk.

The junk he wasted his life on.

INDY

Everything?

INDY

(giving up)

That's too bad.

MARION

You look disappointed. I like that.

How's it feel?

MARION

(nods at his empty

glass)

What are you drinking?

INDY

Seltzer.

MARION

(refilling his glass)

Real man's drink. Me, I like scotch.

And I like bourbon. And vodka and

gin. I'm not much for brandy. I'm

off that.

INDY

You're a tough broad now, aren't

you?

MARION

It's no act, pal. This ain't

Schenectady.

INDY

I can only say I'm sorry so many

times.

MARION

You really have money? You don't

look rich.

(Indy nods)

I may be able to locate some of his

things. I know who's got them. What

do you want?

INDY

A bronze piece, about this size. In

the shape of the sun. Probably broken

off at the bottom. Has a little hole

in it, off-center. Does that sound

familiar?

INDY

Do you know where it is?

MARION

Maybe. How much?

INDY

Three thousand. American.

MARION

(negative)

That'll get me back, but not in style.

This doodad must be pretty important.

INDY

Maybe.

MARION

I knew it would happen eventually. I

knew it. Something had to go my way.

(pours herself another

drink)

I've got to think this out. I'm used

to bargaining with yaks.

INDY

Okay, five thousand. That's all I

can give you now. I can get you more

when you land in the States.

MARION

You word, huh?

(Indy nods)

Just like you said you'd be back

last time? That was your word too.

INDY

I'm back, aren't I?

INDY

You can trust me.

MARION

Come back tomorrow.

INDY

Why?

MARION

Because I said so, that's why. It's

about time I called the shots in

this relationship.

MARION

Wait a minute. Leave the five thousand

here.

(Indy hesitates)

You want trust, give some. I want to

smell your money.

INDY

I trust you.

MARION

You're an idiot.

INDY

I've heard that.

MARION

Hold it. Come here.

INDY

(moving back)

Bossy, aren't you?

MARION

That's right. Give me a kiss.

MARION

Get out of my place.

INDY

Tomorrow.

DISSOLVE TO:

BELZIG

Good evening, Fraulein.

MARION

The bar's closed.

BELZIG

We are not thirsty.

MARION

What do you want?

BELZIG

The same thing your friend Dr. Jones

wanted. Surely he told you there

would be other interested parties.

BELZIG

Ah, the man is nefarious. I hope for

your sake he has not yet acquired

it.

MARION

Why, are you willing to offer more?

BELZIG

Almost certainly. Do you still have

it?

MARION

No. But I know where it is.

MARION

How 'bout a drink for you and your

men?

BELZIG

We will stick to the business at

hand, Fraulein.

MARION

(tough)

Fine. Why don't you come back tomorrow

when Jones is here and we'll have an

auction?

BELZIG

I'm afraid an auction is not possible.

(pause)

Your fire is dying here, Fraulein.

(a beat, then

threatening)

Why don't you tell us where the piece

is right now?

MARION

Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know who

you're used to dealing with, but no

one tells me what to do in my place.

BELZIG

Americans! You're all alike. Fraulein

Ravenwood. I'll show you want I'm

used to.

MARION

Wait! I can be reasonable -

BELZIG

That time is passed.

MARION

You don't need that. I'll tell you

everything!

BELZIG

Yes, I know you will.

INDY

Hello.

BELZIG

Shoot them both!

SECOND NAZI

He's our man!

BELZIG

Do as I say!

MARION

Unbelievable!

INDY

Let's get out of here!

MARION

Not without that piece you want!

INDY

It's here?

INDY

Forget it! I want you out of here.

Now!

MARION

(pointing)

There!

INDY

Let's go!

MARION

(looking around)

You burned down my place!

INDY

(figuratively)

I owe you plenty!

MARION

(literally)

You owe me plenty!

INDY

(smiles)

You're something!

MARION

I am something. And I'll tell you

exactly what -

MARION

I'm your partner!

FAYAH

Silence!

(there is silence)

Why do you forget yourselves?

FAYAH

What is this? Who brought this animal

in?

MARION

Why, thank you. I like you too.

FAYAH

Then it shall be welcome in our house.

MARION

Oh, no! You don't have to have it

around if you don't want it -

SALLAH

(cheerfully)

All of Allah's creatures are welcome

here. You please us by letting us

please you.

INDY

I knew the Germans would hire you,

Sallah. They couldn't have an

excavation in the desert without the

best digger in Egypt.

SALLAH

All Arabs look alike to them, Indy.

INDY

Tell me about the map room at Tanis.

SALLAH

We found it three days ago. I broke

through myself.

INDY

Those Nazis are moving awfully fast.

SALLAH

The Frenchman is helping them.

INDY

Belloq. So he got away from the

Indians. This is going to be more

interesting that I thought.

SALLAH

I'm afraid this has put the Germans

close to finding the Well of the

Souls.

INDY

(indicates the

headpiece)

Even Belloq won't be able to find it

without that. Can you make anything

of those markings? They're nothing

I'm familiar with.

SALLAH

(shakes his head "no")

But I know someone who might. You

can go to see him tomorrow.

(a worried expression)

Indy... something bothers me.

INDY

What is it, my friend?

SALLAH

It is the Ark. If it is there, at

Tanis... It is not something man was

meant to disturb... Death has always

surrounded it. It is not of this

earth.

INDY

Do you really need that monkey?

MARION

I'm surprised at you, Indy. Talking

that way about our baby. He's got

your looks, too.

INDY

And your brains.

MARION

(looking disappointed)

Hey! Hey!... where're you going?

INDY

(dragging Marion on)

He'll be OK. Come on. Come on.

INDY

(to Marion)

Run! Get out of here!

INDY

Go, dammit! Go!

MARION

Indy-y-y-y!

INDY

Marion.

ARAB BARTENDER

The gentleman in the corner sent it.

He would like you to join him.

INDY

(doesn't even look)

Too bad. I'm drinking alone.

INDY

Belloq.

BELLOQ

Good evening, Dr. Jones.

INDY

I ought to kill you right now.

BELLOQ

It was not I who brought the girl

into this dirty business.

BELLOQ

Sit down, please, before you fall

down. We can behave as civilized

people. I'm afraid it will be your

last opportunity.

INDY

Not a very private place for a murder.

BELLOQ

(looking around)

These Arabs will not interfere in

the white man's business. They do

not care if we kill each other off.

(takes a sip of wine,

refers to it)

Terribly difficult finding a decent

vintage here. You were quite vigorous

in Shanghai. Unfortunately, our friend

the Wild Boar had taken the precaution

of making several copies of the piece.

BELLOQ

How odd that is should end this way

for us, after so many... stimulating

encounters. I almost regret it. Where

shall I find a new adversary so close

to my own level?

INDY

Try the local sewer.

BELLOQ

I know you despise me. We always

hate in others that which we most

fear in ourselves. And you and I are

very much alike.

INDY

Now you're getting nasty.

BELLOQ

We have always done the same kind of

work. Our methods have not differed

as much as you pretend. I am a shadowy

reflection of you. But it would have

taken only a nudge to make you the

same as me, to push you out of the

light.

BELLOQ

You know it to be true! How nice.

And how ironic the timing.

BELLOQ

Do you realize what the Ark is?

(very intense)

It's a transmitter. A radio for

talking to God! And now it is within

my grasp.

INDY

What about your boss, der Fuhrer? I

thought he was waiting to take

possession.

BELLOQ

(quieter)

When the time is right. When I am

finished with it.

INDY

I hope your friends are patient.

Dangerous work, Belloq.

BELLOQ

Yes. Very. You may consider yourself

fortunate that your involvement

concludes here.

INDY

Tell me, did you get away with the

idol?

BELLOQ

(negative)

I was lucky to get away with my life.

The Hovitos proved quite narrow-minded

about the whole matter.

INDY

You know, if it's God you want to

talk to, maybe I can arrange it.

BELLOQ

(smiles)

You have not changed. But, please,

do not reach for your weapon until

you are ready to die.

LITTLE SON

Uncle Indy, we have been looking for

you.

LITTLE DAUGHTER

Come home now, Uncle. Hurry!

INDY

Yes. Yes, I'll come now.

BELLOQ

Next time, Indiana Jones, it will

take more than children to save you.

SALLAH

I thought we would find you there.

(indicating the kids)

Better than the United States Marines,

eh?

INDY

(nods)

Thanks you.

(grave)

Marion's dead.

SALLAH

Yes, I know. I am sorry.

(pause)

More reason than ever to beat the

bastards.

(he touches Indy)

Life goes on, Indy.

(indicates the kids

again)

There is the proof.

SALLAH

I have much to tell you, Indy.

INDY

And they made the calculation in the

map room?

SALLAH

(nods vigorously)

This morning. Belloq and the boss

German, Shliemann. When they came

out of the map room, we were given a

new spot in which to dig... out away

from the camp.

INDY

(resigned)

The Well of the Souls.

AMIR

Come. Look.

AMIR

This is a warning... not to disturb

the Ark of the Covenant.

INDY

Just want I need.

INDY

How 'bout the height of the staff?

Did Belloq get it off of there?

AMIR

Yes... it is here.

AMIR

It says it is... ten jamirs high...

SALLAH

About seventy-five inches.

AMIR

Wait! I am not finished...

AMIR

(reading)

"And one jamir to honor the Hebrew

God whose Ark this is."

INDY

You said their top section was blank.

Are you absolutely sure?

INDY

Belloq's staff is seven and a half

inches short. They're digging in the

wrong spot!

SALLAH

(to Amir)

A home run, my friend, grand slam!

(to Indy)

We have a saying - "A little luck is

better than much smartness." Indy,

pardner, you are very lucky fellow.

SALLAH

Bad dates.

INDY

My God! They aren't kidding!

SALLAH

There! That is the map room!

INDY

What time does the sun hit the map?

SALLAH

Just after eight.

INDY

We haven't got much time. Where are

the Germans digging for the Well of

the Souls?

INDY

Okay. Let's go.

JEEP GERMAN (O.S.)

Hey! You, the skinny one!

JEEP GERMAN

Yes, you. What are you doing there?

JEEP GERMAN

Well bring that rope over here, you

cur.

HUNGRY GERMAN (O.S.)

Bring us some of that!

HUNGRY GERMAN

Now, idiot!

HUNGRY GERMAN

Water. Bring us water.

INDY

(stage whisper)

Sallah.

(he waits, then louder)

Sallah!

INDY

(loudest)

Sallah!

HUNGRY GERMAN (O.S.)

Hey, you! More water over here!

HUNGRY GERMAN

Why aren't you at the digs? Come

here!

HUNGRY GERMAN

(yelling after him,

irritated)

No, dummkopf, I said come!

INDY

I though you were dead.

MARION

They were throwing me around like a

rag doll.

INDY

They must have switched baskets.

Thank god for that! Bless those

bastards. Have they hurt you?

MARION

No. Not since I got here. They just

asked about you - what you knew. The

Frenchman's got the hot's for me.

I've been playing that along. Oh,

Indy, get me out of here.

MARION

What's wrong?

INDY

(putting the knife

away)

I have to leave you here for a little

while. I know where the Ark is. If I

take you out of here they'll start

combing the place for us.

MARION

(louder)

Cut me loose!

INDY

Keep your voice down.

MARION

(screaming)

I said get me out of -

INDY

Look, you don't know how glad I am

to see you. And I don't like doing

this. But the whole thing will be

shot if you don't just sit here

quietly. They haven't hurt you in

the last twenty-four hours, they

aren't going to start now. I'll be

back to get you in no time.

INDY

There!

DISSOLVE TO:

BELLOQ

I cautioned you about being premature

with that communique to Berlin.

Archeology is not an exact science.

If does not adhere to time schedules.

SHLIEMANN

The Fuhrer is not a patient man. He

demands constant reports and he

expects progress. You led me to

believe -

BELLOQ

Nothing. I have made no promises. I

said only that it looked very

favorable. Perhaps the Ark will still

be found in an adjoining chamber.

Based on the information in our

possession, my calculations were

correct. Perhaps some bit of evidence

still eludes us. Perhaps

GOBLER

Perhaps the girl can help us.

SHLIEMANN

My feeling exactly. She was in

possession of the original piece for

years. She may know much.

(really evil)

If properly motivated...

BELLOQ

I tell you, she knows nothing useful.

SHLIEMANN

I'm surprised to find you squeamish.

That is not your reputation. But it

needn't concern you. I have the

perfect man for this kind of work.

INDY

The Ark must be in that stone case.

What's that gray stuff all over the

floor -

INDY

Why snakes? Why did it have to be

snakes? Anything else.

SALLAH

Asps. Very dangerous.

INDY

Lots of torches. And oil. I want a

landing strip down there.

BELLOQ

Believe me, you made a mistake. If

you would just give me something to

placate them. Some bit of information.

MARION

I swear to you, I know nothing more.

I have no loyalty to Jones. He's

brought me only trouble.

BELLOQ

I cannot control them.

BELZIG

We meet again, Fraulein.

INDY

Don't touch it! Never touch it!

INDY

Hurry up! Why did it have to be

snakes?

INDY

What the -

BELLOQ

Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you

doing in such a nasty place?

INDY

Why don't you fellows come down here?

I'll show you.

BELLOQ

No thank you, my friend.

(he glances around

him)

I think we are all very comfortable

up here.

BELLOQ

(down to Indy)

After all these years, it is most

considerate of you to aid me in this

way.

SHLIEMANN

I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr.

Jones. Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

But I do not wish to leave you down

in that awful place...

(he give a sign)

...all alone.

MARION

Don't put me down!

BELLOQ

The girl was mine!

SHLIEMANN

She is of no use to us. Only our

mission for the Fuhrer matters.

SHLIEMANN

I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you

have that clearly in mind.

BELLOQ

Goodbye, mademoiselle.

(a pause, then with

respect)

Indiana Jones... adieu!

INDY

Don't panic. There's plenty of time

for that later. Wave that at anything

that slithers.

MARION

What are you doing?

INDY

Just watch the floor.

MARION

Whatever you're doing, do it faster.

INDY

(he spots something)

There!

INDY

Come on!

INDY

Stay here!

MARION

(grabbing him)

Where are you going?

INDY

I'll be back in a minute. We're going

through this wall.

INDY

Just keep your eyes open and get

ready to run. No matter what happens

to me.

MARION

(panicked)

What do you mean?

MARION (O.S.)

(screaming)

Where are you?!

MARION

Indy! Where are you?! Please Lord!

INDY

Come on!

MARION

The snakes... are they here?

INDY

I guess not. I think I'd be dead.

MARION

Do you know where you're going?

INDY

Absolutely.

MARION

Thank god. Where?

INDY

Out.

INDY

Don't do that. It scares me.

INDY

Look!

GOBLER

Get is gassed immediately! It has an

important cargo to take out!

INDY

When the Ark gets loaded, we're

already going to be on that plane.

INDY

Get out! Get out!

SHLIEMANN

Stay with the Ark!

SHLIEMANN

Sabotage!

BELLOQ

We must get the Ark away from this

place immediately!

SHLIEMANN

(to Gobler)

Have it put on the truck. We'll fly

out of Cairo.

SHLIEMANN

And Gobler -

(Gobler stops)

I want plenty of protection.

SALLAH

Holy smoke, my friends! I am so

pleased you are not dead.

MARION

Us too.

SALLAH

(suddenly remembering)

The Ark! They're taking it on a truck

to Cairo.

INDY

Where is it?

INDY

You two get back to Cairo quick and

get us transportation to England - a

plane, a ship, anything.

MARION

What about you?

INDY

I'm going to get that truck. I'll

meet you at Omar's. Be ready for me.

MARION

How are you going to get that truck?

INDY

(still searching)

I don't know. I'm making this up as

I go.

SHLIEMANN

(yelling)

If anything happens to that Ark,

we're all dead men ! The Fuhrer will

see to it!

DISSOLVE TO:

MARION

I have a feeling I'm not the first

woman to travel with these pirates.

There's a whole wardrobe in there.

INDY

It's lovely.

MARION

I feel like a virgin bride in this.

INDY

That's what you look like.

MARION

(takes a drink)

There are some things you can

recapture in this life, but that

isn't one of them.

INDY

What would you like to recapture?

MARION

(after a long pause)

Nothing. That is the way it is.

INDY

Did I ever say I was sorry I burned

down your tavern?

MARION

No. Then again, I burned up that

plane.

INDY

You saved my life.

MARION

And you saved mine.

INDY

Seems things have worked out kind of

even.

MARION

That's the way I like them.

INDY

Maybe we should consider all past

accounts closed.

MARION

No. Not yet.

INDY

What else?

MARION

What is it?

INDY

The engines have shut down.

MARION

Why?

INDY

I'm going to find out.

MESSENGER PIRATE

Mister Jones! The Captain he say -

INDY

What's wrong?

KATANGA

You have most important friends.

INDY

Holy shit.

KATANGA

(fast)

I sent my man for you. You and the

girl must disappear. We have a place

in the hold. Go, my friend!

SHLIEMANN

Take it aboard the Wurrfler!

BELLOQ

And be very careful!

SHLIEMANN

(to a Sergeant below)

What about Jones?

SERGEANT

Not a trace yet, sir!

KATANGA

Jones is dead.

KATANGA

We killed him. He was of no use to

us. The girl, however, has certain

value where we are headed. She will

bring a very good price. If that

cargo you have taken was your goal,

then go in peace with it. But leave

us the girl. It will reduce our loss

on this trip.

SHLIEMANN

Savage. You are not in a position to

ask for anything. We will take what

we wish and then decide whether or

not to blow your ship from the water.

BELLOQ

That girl goes with me. It will be

part of my compensation. I'm sure

the Fuhrer would approve.

BELLOQ

If she fails to please me, you can

do with her as you wish.

DISSOLVE TO:

THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN

Colonel Shliemann, all torpedoes are

loaded.

SHLIEMANN

What do you think, Captain?

THE WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN

(earnestly)

I think not, Colonel. Nothing is to

be gained. We are not at war.

SHLIEMANN

...yet. Let the vermin live. We must

be on our way.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE OUT:

INDY

Damn!

TALL CAPTAIN

(to Belloq)

The tents have been arranged in

accordance with your radioed

instructions, sir.

BELLOQ

Good. We must take the Ark there

now.

SHLIEMANN

I am uncomfortable with the thought

of this -

(spitting it out)

Jewish ritual. Are you sure it's

necessary?

BELLOQ

(playing him)

Let me ask you this - Would you be

more comfortable opening the Ark in

Berlin - for the Fuhrer - and finding

out only then if the sacred pieces

of the Covenant are inside? Knowing,

only then, whether you have

accomplished your mission and obtained

the one, true Ark?

INDY

Hold it.

(the Nazi react)

One move from anybody and I blow

that box back to Moses.

BELLOQ

Jones, your persistence surprises

even me. You are going to give

mercenaries a bad name.

INDY

What about you? Talked to God yet?

(Belloq's eyes flash)

Where's the girl?

SHLIEMANN

Doctor Jones, surely you don't think

you can escape from this base.

INDY

That depends on how reasonable we're

all willing to be. All I want is the

girl. We'll keep possession of the

Ark only till we've got safe transport

to England. Then it's all yours.

SHLIEMANN

If we refuse?

INDY

Then the Ark and some of us are going

up in a big bang. I don't think Hitler

would like that a bit. Now I don't

want to talk about this anymore.

Show me that girl in five seconds or -

SHLIEMANN

Jones, this is the second time I

have seen you looking very foolish.

INDY

It's a bad habit. I'm trying to break

it.

SHLIEMANN

I'll help you. This time I'll kill

you myself.

BELLOQ

No! Not in the presence of the Ark!

Take him outside.

BELLOQ

Indiana Jones, I salute you. I am

even a little sorry you will miss

this moment.

INDY

Thanks. If you talk to Him, tell Him

I'm on my way up.

INDY

Marion! Marion, can you hear me?

INDY

Hi.

MARION

Oh, Indy! Thank god you're here.

INDY

Glad I could make it.

INDY

Let's get out of here.

MARION

What about the Ark?

INDY

Are you game?

MARION

Hell yes! We've made it this far.

INDY

(grins at her)

Okay. Let's do it.

INDY

Whatever you do, don't touch it.

Let's put it on the floor.

INDY

We'll go down that side. Shoot anyone

who looks at us crosseyed.

SHLIEMANN

Stop them! Kill them!

INDY

(to Marion)

Get down!

OFFICER

We must cover the drums! Protect

them from the bullets!

MARION

Slow it down!

MUSGROVE

You've done your country a great

service.

EATON

And we trust you found the settlement

satisfactory?

MARION

Quite.

EATON

Good, good.

(glances around at

the others)

Then I guess that about does it.

BRODY

When can we have the Ark?

EATON

I thought we answered that. It's

someplace very safe -

INDY

(heated)

That's a powerful force. Research

should be done -

EATON

Oh, it will be, Dr. Jones, I assure

you. We have top men working on it

right now.

INDY

Who?

EATON

Top men.

INDY

We may be able to help.

EATON

We appreciate that. And we won't

hesitate to call on you.

MUSGROVE

(dismissing them)

Thank you all. Thank you again.

MARION

Well they aren't going to tell you,

so why don't you just forget it. I'd

think you'd had enough of that damn

Ark. Just put your mind on something

else.

INDY

Yeah, like what?

INDY

It's not the Ark... but it'll have

to do.

TOP SECRET

ARMY INTEL. #9906753

DO NOT OPEN!

FADE OUT:
