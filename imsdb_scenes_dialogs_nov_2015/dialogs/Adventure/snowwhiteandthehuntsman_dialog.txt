ECU - A small songbird, it's chest open, revealing a small

heart. Ravenna's claw plucks the tiny heart and we follow it

to her mouth.

She is dressed now and stands at a window, Finn at her side.

OUTSIDE THE WINDOW - A CROWD OF STARVING PEASANTS at the foot

of the castle, fight over the milk pouring from her bath.
