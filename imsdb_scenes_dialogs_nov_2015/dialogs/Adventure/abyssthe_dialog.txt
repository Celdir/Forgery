THE ABYSS

AN ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY

Director's Revision

THE ABYSS

CAPTAIN

Sixty knots?  No way, Barnes... the reds don't

have anything that fast.

BARNES

Checked it twice, skipper.  It's a real unique

signature.  No cavitation, no reactor noise...

doesn't even sound like screws.

CAPTAIN

What the hell is it?

EXEC

I'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of

ours.

BARNES

Sir!  Contact changing heading to two-one-four,

diving.  Speed eighty knots!  Eighty knots!

EXEC

Eighty knots...

BARNES

Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port

clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

FRANK

(simultaneously)

Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port

clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

EXEC

(low, to Captain)

It's getting tight in here.

CAPTAIN

We can still give him a haircut.  Helm, come

right to oh six niner, down five degrees.

HELMSMAN

Coming right to oh six niner, sir.  Down five

degrees.

NAVIGATOR

Port side clearance one hundred twenty feet

narrowing to seventy-five.  Sir, we have a

proximity warning light.

EXEC

That's too damn close!  We've gotta back off.

BARNES

Range to contact, two hundred.  Contact junked to

bearing two six oh and accelerated to... one

hundred thirty knots, sir!

EXEC

(really freaked now)

Nothing goes one thirty!

EXEC

Turbulence!  We're in its wake!

CAPTAIN

Helm, all stop!  Full right rudder!

HELMSMAN

All stop.  Full right rudder.  Hydraulic failure.

Planes are not responding, sir!

HELMSMAN

Hydraulics restored, sir.

CAPTAIN

Collision alarm!  Collision alarm!  Lighten

her up, Charlie!

NAVIGATOR

The torpedo room is flooded, sir!

CAPTAIN

Blow all tanks!  Blow everything!

HELMSMAN

Passing twelve hundred feet...

EXEC

Blowing main tanks!

HELMSMAN

Twelve hundred fifty feet...

EXEC

Main forward tanks ruptured!

HELMSMAN

Passing thirteen hundred feet...

EXEC

Too deep to pump auxiliaries!

CAPTAIN

All back full!  All back full!

HELMSMAN

Answering all back full.  Passing thirteen hundred

fifty feet... fourteen hundred... fourteen

fifty...

CAPTAIN

We're losing her.  Launch the buoy!

CUT TO:

MCBRIDE

Does not look good at all.

DEMARCO (V.O.)

No light from the surface.  How deep are they?

MCBRIDE (V.O.)

Seventeen hundred feet.

DEMARCO

I need them to go to over two thousand.

KIRKHILL

They can do it.

(to McBride)

Get Brigman on the line.

CUT TO:

BUD

Hey, you guys are milking that job.

CATFISH

(Kentucky drawl)

That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out

here sooo much, boss.

JAMMER

(yelling)

Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call

from topside.  That new company man.

BUD

Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from

a rathole.  Hey, Perry!

BUD

Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and

those cable slings.  This place is starting to

look like my apartment.

P.A. (HIPPY'S VOICE)

BUD, PICK UP THE TOPSIDE LINE URGENT.

BUD

I'm coming.  Keep your pantyhose on.

BUD

Brigman here.  Kirkhill?  What's going on?

(pause)

I am calm.  I'm a calm person.  Is there some

reason why I shouldn't be calm?

BUD

Son of a bitch.

BUD

All divers.  Drop what you're doing.  Everybody

out of the pool.

ONE NIGHT

Here you go, hon'.

SONNY

Just in time, sugar.

ONE NIGHT

Dammit, we just got out here.

SONNY

There was a time when I would have asked why.

CUT TO:

FINLER

What's goin' on?  How come we got recalled?

SONNY

Hell is I know.

CATFISH

Just follow standard procedure, will ya...

flog the dog till somebody tells us what's

happening.

JAMMER

Hey, Catfish, I'll sell you my October Penthouse

for twenty bucks.

ONE NIGHT

Save you money, darlin'... the pages are all

stuck together by now.

JAMMER

What's goin' on, Boss?

BUD

Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole

and prepare to move the rig.

SONNY

She-hit.

BUD

We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of

national security.  Now you know exactly as much

as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to

control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten

minutes.

CUT TO:

DEMARCO

At 09:22 local time this morning, an American

nuclear submarine, the USS Montana, with 156 men

aboard, went down 22 miles from here.  There has

been no contact with the sub since then.  The

cause of the incident is not known.

DEMARCO

Your company has authorized the Navy's use of

this facility for a rescue operation.  The code

name is Operation Salvor.

ONE NIGHT

You want us to search for the sub?

DEMARCO

No.  We know where it is.  But she's in 2000 feet

of water and we can't reach her.  We need divers

to enter the sub and search for survivors, if

any.

BUD

Don't you guys have your own stuff for this type

of thing?

DEMARCO

By the time we get our rescue submersible here

the storm front will be right on us.  But you

can get your rig in under the storm and be on-

site in fifteen hours.  That makes you our best

option right now.

HIPPY

Why should we risk our butts on a job like this?

KIRKHILL

I have been authorized to offer you all special-

duty bonuses equivalent to three times normal

dive pay.

CATFISH

Hell, for triple time I'd crawl through razor

blades and shower off with lime juice.

FINLER

I'm here to tell ya', you could set me on fire

and call me names.

BUD

Look, I don't know what kind of a deal you guys

worked out with the company, but my people are

not qualified for this... they're oil workers.

DEMARCO

A four-man SEAL team will transfer down to you

to supervise the operation.

BUD

You can send down whoever you like, but I'm the

toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the

safety of these people, there's me... then

there's God.  Understand?  If things get dicey,

I'm pulling the plug.

KIRKHILL

I think we're all on the same wavelength,

Brigman.  Now let's get the wellhead uncoupled,

shall we?

CUT TO:

JAMMER

When Lindsey finds out about this, it's not

gonna be a pretty sight.

ONE NIGHT

They're going to have to shoot her with a

tranquilizer gun.

CUT TO:

PILOT

No way I'm putting her down.  I shouldn't even

be flying in this shit.

COFFEY

(cool)

Just hold it over the deck.

COFFEY

You want to be on that ship, there's only one

way it's going to happen.

CUT TO:

MCBRIDE (on screen)

Well, it's official, sportsfans.  They're calling

it Hurricane Frederick, and it's going to be

making our lives real interesting in a few hours.

BUD

Fred, huh?  I don't know.  Hurricanes should be

named after women.

CUT TO:

LINDSEY

I can't believe you let them do this!

BUD

(unpreturbed, almost cheerful)

Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.

LINDSEY

I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last

flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left

it, is it, Bud?

BUD

Wasn't up to me.

LINDSEY

We were that close to proving a submersible

drilling platform could work.  We had over seven

thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I

can't believe you let them grab my rig!

BUD

Your rig?

LINDSEY

My rig.  I designed the damn thing.

BUD

Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long

as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they

tell me.

LINDSEY

You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They

bought you... more like least rented you cheap--

BUD

I'm switching off now.

LINDSEY

Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up

to fight.  You--

BUD

Bye.

HIPPY

Virgil?

BUD

God, I hate that bitch.

HIPPY

Yeah, well you never should have married her then.

CUT TO:

LINDSEY

Let's go, gentlemen!  We either launch now or

we don't launch.

LINDSEY

Take her up, Byron!

KIRKHILL

What the hell is she doing out there?  Son of a

bitch...

(into microphone)

Lindsey... get out of Cab Three.  Bates is taking

her down.

LINDSEY

Bates is sick.  Besides I've got more hours in

this thing than he does.

(to Coffey)

A little change of plan.

COFFEY

Lady, we better fish or cut bait.

LINDSEY

Just hold your water, okay?

(to Kirkhill)

So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk

about it?

DEMARCO

I don't care who drives the damn thing.  Just get

my team in the water.

KIRKHILL

Alright, alright.  Christ Almighty!

MCBRIDE

Cab Three, you are clear to launch.

LINDSEY

Roger.

(to Coffey)

There's only one way it's going to happen...

LINDSEY

Touchdown.  The crowd goes wild.  Explorer...

Cab Three.  We are styling.

MCBRIDE (filtered)

Roger, Cab Three.

BUD/HIPPY

... I've been driving every kinda rig that's

ever been maaaaade...

LINDSEY (V.O.)

Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on

final approach.

HIPPY (V.O.)

Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You,

Lindsey?

LINDSEY (V.O.)

None other.

BUD

Oh no... you gotta be kidding me.

CATFISH

Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned!

You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll

might run ya stockings.

LINDSEY

Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us?

Good.  Couldn't ask for better.

CATFISH

Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.

LINDSEY

Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six

hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news

is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress

back to the surface later.

COFFEY

We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.

LINDSEY

Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright,

from now on we watch each other closely for

signs of HPNS...

MONK

(as if by rote)

High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors,

usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased

excitability, disorientation.

LINDSEY

Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't

handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to

predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.

COFFEY

Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth.

We're checked out.

LINDSEY

Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.

(Coffey turn away)

Well, hey... you guys know any songs?

CATFISH

Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of

guys tougher'n them.

HIPPY

Now we get to hear about how he used to be a

contender.

CATFISH

You see this?  They used to call this the Hammer.

JAMMER

Hippy wasn't born then.

COFFEY

Curiosity killed the cat.

CUT TO:

CATFISH

Y'all'er done to a turn and ready to serve.

Everybody okay?

LINDSEY

Hey, was there a wall here before?  I don't

remember a wall here.  Oh, Jammer!  Hi.

JAMMER

Howdy, there, little lady.

COFFEY

(to Jammer)

Show us the dive prep area.  We need to check

out your gear.

LINDSEY

Those guys are about a much fun as a tax audit.

CUT TO:

LINDSEY

Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease.

BUD

Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.

LINDSEY

Not for long.

BUD

You never did like being called that, did you?

LINDSEY

Not even when it meant something.

(looking through the front port)

Is that One Night up in Flatbed?

BUD

Who else?

LINSEY

Hi, One Night, it's Lindsey.

ONE NIGHT

Oh, hi, Lindsey.

BUD

I can't believe you were dumb enough to come

down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm...

dumb, hot-rod... dumb.

LINDSEY

Look, I didn't come down here to fight.

BUD

Then why'd you come down?

LINDSEY

You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this

rig better than I do.  What is something was

to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What

would have you done?

BUD

Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've

had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a

disaster.

BUD

(yelling)

You wanna know what I think?

LINDSEY

Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set!

Morons.

BUD

I think you were worried about me.

LINDSEY

That must be it.

BUD

No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.

LINDSEY

I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four

years invested in this project.

BUD

Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years

with me.

LINDSEY

You've got to have priorities.

CUT TO:

BUD

My bunk's the only one I can guarantee won't be

occupied.  You can grab a couple hours before

we get there.

LINDSEY

What are you still wearing that for?

BUD

I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to

take it off.

LINDSEY

I haven't worn mine in months.

BUD

Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The

Suit.

LINDSEY

Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit?

It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name

is Michael.

BUD

So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks

Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?

LINDSEY

No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

BUD

What happened?

LINDSEY

Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of

you life any more.

BUD

I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one

day and realized the guy never made you laugh.

LINDSEY

You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple.

Aren't you clever?  You should get your own

show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn

from three hundred fathoms.

LINDSEY

AAAARRRGGH!

LINDSEY

Shit.

BUD

Shit.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

COFFEY (V.O.)

This is us.  We're just on the edge of the Cayman

Trough.  The Montana is here, on its side, 300

meters away and 70 meters below us.  We think she

slid down the wall, and lodged against this

outcropping.

SONNY

This tells us how much radiation we get?

HIPPY

Hey, whoah... I can't handle no radiation, man.

Forget it!  Include me out.

CATFISH

Hippy, you pussy.

HIPPY

What good's the money if your dick drops off in

six months?

COFFEY

We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's

breached or the warheads have released

radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.

BUD

Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you

can run Little Geek.

HIPPY

No way!  No way!  He can't fly an ROV worth

shit.  I'll go.  Shit!

COFFEY

(to all)

On the dive, you will do absolutely nothing

without direct orders from me, and you will

follow my instructions without discussion.  Is

this clear?  Alright, I want everyone finished

prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes.

BUD

Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on

bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better

start cutting them some slack.

COFFEY

I can't afford slack, Brigman.

BUD

Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me,

you start ordering my guys around.  It won't

work.  You gotta know how to handle these

people... we have a certain way of doing things

here.

COFFEY

I'm not interested in your way of doing things.

Just get your team ready to dive.

FINLER

Hey, you know your hand is blue?

BUD

Shut up and get your gear on.

HIPPY

I've been meaning to ask you what this thing is.

MONK

Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We

use it if we need to go really deep.

HIPPY

How deep?

MONK

Deep.

(shrugs)

It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you

breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed.

Pressure doesn't get to you.

CATFISH

You're saying you get liquid in your lungs?

MONK

Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.

HIPPY

Hey!

MONK

Check this out.

MONK

See?  He's diggin' it.

CATFISH

This is no bullshit hands down the goddamnedest

thing I ever saw.

CUT TO:

LINDSEY

Com-check, everybody.  Flatbed, you on line?

ONE NIGHT

Ten-four, Lindsey, read you loud and clear.

LINDSEY

Cab Three?

HIPPY

Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.

LINDSEY (V.O.)

What's you depth, Cab Three?

HIPPY

1840... 50... 60... 70...

LINDSEY

Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065.

Everybody stay tight and in sight.

ONE NIGHT

Starting out descent.  Divers, how're you doing?

BUD

Okay so far.

JAMMER

How deep's the drop-off here?

CATFISH

This here's the bottomless pit, baby.  Two and

a half miles straight down.

COFFEY

Knock off the chatter.  Cab One, you getting

anything?

COFFEY

Cab One, do you see it yet?

LINDSEY

The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing

a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are

you sure you got the depth right on this?

BUD (V.O., filtered)

You should be almost to it, ace.

LINDSEY

Uh, yeah, roger that... uh, found it.

COFFEY

Cab One, radiation readings?

LINDSEY

Neutron counter's not showing very much.

COFFEY

Wilhite, anything?

WILHITE

Negative.  Nominal.

COFFEY

Just continue forward along the hull.

LINDSEY

Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want

me to get shots of everything, right?

COFFEY

Roger, document as much as you can, but keep

moving.  We're on a tight timeline.

LINDSEY

Copy that.

COFFEY

That's the midship hatch.  You see it, Cab Three?

HIPPY

Roger, I see it.

BUD

Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.

HIPPY

Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?

COFFEY

Right.

ONE NIGHT

How do you want me?

COFFEY

Just hold above it.  Alright, A team.

MONK (V.O.)

Stand by on the ROV.

HIPPY

Perry, stand by on the ROV.

(to Little Geek)

Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than

me, know what I mean?

MONK

It's flooded.  Alright, I'm opening her up.

COFFEY (V.O.)

Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still

be intact.

LINDSEY

How many are there?

COFFEY (V.O.)

24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.

LINDSEY

That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are

they?

SCHOENICK

Your MIRV is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons

nominal yield.  Say times time Hiroshima.

LINDSEY (V.O.)

Jesus Christ... this is World War Three in a

can.

COFFEY (V.O.)

Let's knock off the chatter, please.

MONK (V.O.)

Getting a reading?

HIPPY

It's twitching but it's below the line you said

was safe.

MONK

Alright.  Let's get in there.

COFFEY

We'll go in through that large breach.

BUD

Let's go, guys.

BUD

Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in

sight.  Watch for hatches that could close on

you, or any loose equipment that could fall.

COFFEY

It's jammed.  Give me a hand.

COFFEY

Alright, let's keep moving.  We knew we were

going to see this.

BUD

How you guys doing?

SONNY

I'm alright, I'm dealing.

CATFISH

Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It

ain't.  I'm sorry...

BUD

We're here now.  Let's get her done.

COFFEY

This part I do alone.  Brigman, take you men and

continue aft.  Split up into two teams of two.

Let's get moving... we head back in fourteen

minutes.

BUD

Okay, Cat, Lew, Sonny.  You guys stay on this

deck.  Hook you line onto mine.  Any problem,

you tug my line.  Two pulls.  Jammer, you're

with me.

JAMMER

Where are we?

BUD

Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.

JAMMER

Lord Almighty.

BUD

Hey, you okay?

BUD

Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just

breathe easy.

JAMMER

I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead.

I thought... some of them... you know...

BUD

I'm taking you back out.

JAMMER

No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go

any further in.

BUD

Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here.

I have to go there to the end... you'll see my

lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold

onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?

JAMMER

Yeah, okay.  Okay.

JAMMER

Bud?  BUD?!  You readin' me?  BUD?!!

JAMMER

Bud?  Is that you?

BUD

Jammer?  Answer me, buddy,  JAMMER?!

BUD

Hang on, big guy.  Hand on!

BUD

He's convulsing!

CATFISH

It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!

FINLER

Crank it down, man!  We're gonna losing him...

BUD

SHIT, it's stuck... goddamnit!

SONNY

You got it?!  You got it?

BUD

Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.

BUD

We gotta get him out of here.  Come on!

(to Jammer)

Hang on, buddy.

BUD (V.O.)

CAB ONE!  CAB ONE!  Meet me at Flatbed!  This

is a diver emergency!!  Do you copy?  Lindsey?!

LINDSEY

Copy you, Bud.  On my way.

CUT TO:

BUD

Whattya think?

MONK

I'm a medic, which is mostly about patching

holes.  This type of thing... there's not much

I can do.  The coma could last hours or days.

CUT TO:

DEMARCO (video)

Did any of you see it?

COFFEY

Negative.  But there was definitely a Russian

bogey.  The Brigman woman saw it.

DEMARCO

CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.  Two Russian

attack subs, a Tango and Victor, have been tracked

within fifty miles of here... and now we don't

know what the hell they are.  Okay, I don't have

any choice.  I'm confirming you to go to Phase

Two.

DEMARCO

Is there any problem?

COFFEY

Yes... I mean no.  Negative, sir.

CUT TO:

BUD

Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or

anything?

LINDSEY

No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk

about it.

BUD

Fine.  Be that way.

LINDSEY

I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to

call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a

Russian submersible.  No problem.

BUD

But you think it's something else.  What?  One

of ours?

LINDSEY

No.

BUD

Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...

LINDSEY

Jammer saw something in there, something that

scared the hell out him--

BUD

His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and

pranged his regulator.

LINDSEY

But what did he see that made him panic?

BUD

What do you think he saw?

LINDSEY

I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!

HIPPY

Hey, you guys... hurry up, check this out!

They're announcing it.

CATFISH

Quiet!  Quiet!

HIPPY

Turn it up, bozo.

ANCHORMAN

... the Kremlin continues to deny Russian

involvement in the sinking of the Trident sub

USS Montana.  The Navy has not released the names

of the 156 crewmembers, who are all presumed

dead at this time.  Civilian employees of a

Benthic Petroleum offshore drilling rig--

HIPPY

Hey that's us!

CATFISH

SSSSHHH!

ANCHORMAN

--are apparently participating in the recovery

operation but we have little information about

their involvement.  On the scene now is--

FINLER

BOOOOH!  We want names!

SONNY

Hey, hey!  There's the Explorer.

TYLER

--there is a tremendous amount of activity.

With Cuba only 80 miles away, the massive buildup

of US ships and aircraft in the area has drawn

official protest from Havana and Moscow and has

led to a redirection of Soviet warships into the

Caribbean theater.

ANCHORMAN

How would you describe the mood there?

TYLER

The mood is one of suspicion, even confrontation.

A number of Russian and Cuban trawlers,

undoubtedly surveillance vessels, have been

circling within a few miles throughout the day,

and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned

away from the area...

HIPPY

This sucks.

BUD

What's the matter with you?

HIPPY

Now we're right in the middle of this big-time

international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile

Crisis or something.

LINDSEY

Figured that out for yourself, did you?

HIPPY

We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit!

Something goes wrong they could say anything

happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals,

know what I mean?

BUD

Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women

nervous.

LINDSEY

Cute, Virgil.

HIPPY

No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us

diddly.  Something's going on.

BUD

Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

HIPPY

Everything is.

ONE NIGHT

Hurry up!  Coffey's splitting with Flatbed! He

got me to show him the controls, then his guys

suited up and they're rolling.

BUD

Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?

ONE NIGHT

I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked

ASAP.

BUD

Unbelievable.

CUT TO:

MCBRIDE

We're trying to get unhooked and get out of

here... and your boys go sightseeing!

DEMARCO

They'll be back in two hours.

MCBRIDE

Two hours?!  We're gonna be getting the shit

kicked out of us by our friend Fred in two hours!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)

Little is known at this hour about the events

leading up to the collision.  The US Navy guided

missile  cruiser Appleton apparently struck the

Soviet 'Udaloy' class destroyer in low visibility

conditions...

NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)

In violent seas little hope remains for over a

hundred Russian crewmen still missing after the

sinking an hour ago.

NEWS ANCHOR

Soviet military spokesmen have claimed that

the collision constituted an unprovoked attack.

This was denied--

LINDSEY

Bud, this is big time.

CUT TO:

WILHITE (filtered)

Separation sequencer disconnected.  Next?

MONK (filtered)

Remove explosive bolts one through six in

counterclock-wise sequence.

SCHOENICK (filtered)

Check... removing bolt one.

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

... just learned that Soviet negotiators have

walked out of the strategic arms limitation

summit in protest over the incident this morning.

ANOTHER NEWSCASTER

... US and NATO military forces have been put on

full alert worldwide this morning in the wake

of...

BUD

It's on every channel.

YOUNG WOMAN

You just feel so hopeless.  You can see it coming,

but what can you do?  What can anyone do?

CONSTRUCTION WORKER

Hey, they don't want war any more than we do.

You think about it, you say... hey, they love

their kids too.  So why are we doing this?

WOMAN

If the Russians sank that submarine, they deserve

what they got and a lot more, if you ask me,

and you did.  I think we've been pussyfooting

around with them long enough.

MAN

Scared?  I'm scared ____-less.  But if it happens

it happens, nothing I can do about it.  Right?

So why think about it?

CUT TO:

COFFEY

Don't touch that.  Just step away.  Now!

HIPPY

Excusez moi.

BUD

Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.

COFFEY

Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.

BUD

This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.

ONE NIGHT

Piece of cake, baby.

CUT TO:

BENDIX

We're losing number two thruster.  Bearing's

going.

BENDIX

It's not holding.  We're swinging out of

position!

HIPPY (intercom)

Bud to control!  Emergency!  Bud to Control!

BUD

Topside, topside... pay out some slack, we're

getting dragged!

LINDSEY

We're heading right for the drop off!

MCBRIDE

Bud!  We've lost the crane!

BUD (V.O.)

What?  Say again.

MCBRIDE

THE CRANE!  WE'VE LOST THE CRANE.  IT'S ON ITS

WAY TO YOU!!

LINDSEY

Got it!  It's dropping straight to us.

BUD

Rig for impact!  Seal all exterior hatches.

Move it!  Let's go!

LINDSEY

Oh shit.

LINDSEY

Hey!  Get on this hose, you turkeys!

LINDSEY

No! Hold it on me!

BUD

Heeyy!!  HHHEEEYYY!!

DISSOLVE TO:

SONNY (V.O. static)

Mayday, mayday.  This is Deepcore Two calling

Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?

SONNY

Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read,

over?  This is Deepcore--

BUD

Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.

BUD

Did you find Wilhite?

COFFEY

No.

COFFEY

Brigman.

(Bud turns)

I was under orders.  I had no choice.

BUD

What's the scoop, ace?

LINDSEY

I can get power to this module and sub-bay if

I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the

mains, which are a total melt-down.

BUD

Need some help?

LINDSEY

Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there

won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple

hours this place is going to be as cold as a

meat locker.

BUD

What about O-2?

LINDSEY

Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth

if we close off the sections we're not using.

BUD

The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.

LINDSEY

I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks

outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go

outside to tie onto them.

BUD

Hey, Lins...

(she looks up)

I'm glad your here.

LINDSEY

Yeah?  Well I'm not.

ONE NIGHT

Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit,

boss.

BUD

(to Hippy)

Where're you?

HIPPY

Quarters.  Level two.

HIPPY

That's Perry.

BUD

(lets his breath out slowly)

That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and

Perry.  Jesus.

HIPPY

(gestured at the screen)

Do we just leave him there?

BUD

Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get

something to breathe.

CUT TO:

LINDSEY

Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some

tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check

them out.

CATFISH

You watch yourself.

ONE NIGHT

Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.

(he hands it to her)

So there you were--

BUD

There we were, side by side, on the same ship,

for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're

testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we

get back on the beach and... we're living

together.

ONE NIGHT

Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

BUD

We were due to go back out on the same ship.

Six months of tests.  If you were married you

got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.

ONE NIGHT

Okay, good reason.  Then what?

BUD

It was alright for a while, you know.  But then

she got promoted to project engineer on this

thing, couple years ago.

ONE NIGHT

She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for

me, right there.  That's it.

BUD

Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive--

Son of a--!!

BUD

She didn't leave me... she just left me behind.

ONE NIGHT

Bud, let me tell you something.  She ain't half

as smart as she thinks she is.

HIPPY

Hey, Lindsey, you reading me?  Over.

LINDSEY

Yeah, Hippy, I read you.  What's the matter?

BUD

Lins, how're you doing?  Lindsey?

LINDSEY

Catfish... I got a problem here.  You there?

Catfish?

LINDSEY

You better not say you missed that.

CATFISH

Missed what?

CUT TO:

BUD

Nice shot, Lins.

SONNY

What is that?  You drop your dive light?

LINDSEY

Come on, you guys... look, this is the little

one right here.  You can see how it's kind of

zigging around.

BUD

If you say so.  It could be anything.

LINDSEY

I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not

hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting

from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something

down there.  Something not... us.

CATFISH

Y'all could be more specific.

LINDSEY

Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non-

human, but intelligent...

HIPPY

You mean like Coffey?

LINDSEY

A non-terrestrial intelligence.

HIPPY

Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I

like that better then UFOs.  Although that

works too... Underwater Flying Objects.

CATFISH

Are we talkin' little space friend here?

HIPPY

Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins?

Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has

known about them for years.  They abduct people

all the time.  There was this woman I knew in

Albuquerque who--

LINDSEY

Hippy, do me a favor... stay off my side.

BUD

Lindsey, will you step into my office for a

minute...

BUD

Jesus, Lindsey--

LINDSEY

Bud, something really important is happening

here.

BUD

Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation

together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind

of hysteria--

LINDSEY

Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!

BUD

All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your

fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.

LINDSEY

I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there

and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.

BUD

God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.

LINDSEY

I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do

I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of

pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?

BUD

No.

LINDSEY

Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me

better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my

lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of

them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like

we would build... it glided.  It was the most

beautiful thing I've ever seen.

LINDSEY

It was a machine, but it seems almost alive.

Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to

trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us

harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a

feeling.

BUD

How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's

going to go on you 'feeling'?

LINDSEY

We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks

and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear.

Bud, you have to look with better eyes than

that.

BUD

I can't, Lindsey.  I'm sorry.  How can I?

CUT TO:

COFFEY

I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar

shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early

warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.

LINDSEY

(rolling her eyes)

Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three

and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal

trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking

Russian.

COFFEY

(to One Night)

Why haven't you finished repairs on the

hydrophone transmitter yet?

ONE NIGHT

I was having my nails done.

COFFEY

Get something straight.  You people are under my

authority--

CATFISH

Look, podner... we don't work for you, we don't

take orders from you, and we don't much like you.

In addition to which your momma dresses you

funny.

BUD

'Fish'?

CATFISH

Yuh?

BUD

Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you

handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see

if you can get that transmitter working for me,

okay?

ONE NIGHT

Gimme a couple of hours.

CUT TO:

HIPPY

Come on... move to the left... just a little

more... come on, A.J. Squared Away... that's

it--

HIPPY

Pretty radical, guys.  Pretty radical.

HIPPY (V.O.)

Say hello to MIRV.

HIPPY

Come on, man.  What else could it be?

BUD

Why bring it here?

HIPPY

It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep

it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the

nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in

the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot.

Oh, uh... hi, Lins.

LINDSEY

Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about

it, I will.

BUD

Lindsey!  Wait a second--

LINDSEY

You've got some huevos bringing this...

thing... into my rig!  With everything that's

been going on up in the world, you bring a

nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone

as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?

COFFEY

You don't need to know the details of this

mission... you're better off if you don't.

LINDSEY

You're right... I don't.  I just need to know

that this thing is out of here!  You hear me,

Roger Ramjet?

COFFEY

Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment

to this mission.  I believe the stress is

affecting you.

(to Schoenick)

Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a

tranquilizer.

LINDSEY

Bullshit, you can't do that.  Oww... goddamnit!

BUD

Emergency!  Maintenance room B.  Emergency!

BUD

Let her go.  Do it... right now.

LINDSEY

You dumb jarhead motherf--

BUD

Chill out, Lindsey!!

CATFISH

What's the problem?

BUD

Nothing.  We were just leaving.

(to her)

Weren't we?

COFFEY

They can't be trusted.  They're turning against

us.  We may have to take... steps.

BUD

Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.

HIPPY

Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his

hands?

LINDSEY

He's got the shakes?

BUD

Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off

from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms

of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a

nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me...

will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?

HIPPY

Man, I give this a sphincter-factor of about

nine point five.

CUT TO:

LINDSEY

Look, you can just punch into his little chip

where you want him to go, and he goes, right?

HIPPY

Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna

be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just

sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders

through view of the camera, you'll get nada.

LINDSEY

Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.

HIPPY (V.O.)

I don't know.  I really oughta talk to Bud about

this.

LINDSEY (V.O.)

No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then

tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to

Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off

the button a little.

HIPPY (V.O.)

I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more

than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away

goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple

hours on this.

MONK

Thanks.

LINDSEY

Virgil, turn on your side.

CUT TO:

HIPPY

All set, big guy.  Hey, I told you to wipe that

grin off your face.

BUD

(whispering)

I think it likes you.

LINDSEY

It's trying to communicate.

LINDSEY

Seawater.

LINDSEY

Show off.

LINDSEY

Okay, raise your hand if you think that was a

Russian water-tentacle.  Lieutenant?  No?  Well,

a breakthrough.

BUD

You done impressing yourself, ace?

ONE NIGHT

No way that could just be seawater.

LINDSEY

They must've learned how to control water... I

mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize

it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under

intelligent control.

BUD

Maybe their whole technology is based on that.

Controlling water.

HIPPY

That thing was probably their version of Big

Geek... like an ROV.

CATFISH

Just checking is out, huh?  How come?

LINDSEY

They're curious, maybe.  We could be the first

people they've seen up close.

SONNY

Hope they don't judge the whole race offa us.

CATFISH

Maybe I oughta shave.

COFFEY

It went straight for the warhead.  And they

think it's cute.

SCHOENICK

You need to get some sleep.

COFFEY

We have no way of warning the surface.  Do you

know what that means?

COFFEY

It means... whatever happens is up to us.

CUT TO:

ONE NIGHT

You think they're from down there originally?

Or from... you know.

LINDSEY

I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place

that has similar conditions... cold, intense

pressure.  No light.

CATFISH

Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.

COFFEY

Sniff something did you, rat boy?

COFFEY

FREEZE!  Don't move.  That's it.

(to Monk)

Here, hold this a second.  We're going to phase

three.

HIPPY

They're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the

NTIs!  We set it up to go right to them.

LINDSEY

Oh my God...  Oh no...

(steps toward Coffey)

Please, you can't.  Coffey, think about what

you're doing... for God's sake--

SCHOENICK

GET BACK!

COFFEY

This is something I've wanted to do since I

first met you.

HIPPY

You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's

fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and

we're all ringside!

MONK

What's the timer set for?

SCHOENICK

Three hours.

COFFEY

Shut up!  Don't talk!

MONK

We can't get to minimum-safe-distance in three

hours.  The shockwave will kill us.  It'll crush

this rig like a semi driving over a beer can.

COFFEY

Shut up!  SHUT UP!  What's the matter with you?!

COFFEY

Just stay calm.  The situation is under control.

COFFEY

Stay here.

LINDSEY

Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make

a real bad career move...

HIPPY

That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!

BUD

We have to stop him!  Schoenick!!

LINDSEY

... he's about to declare war on an alien species,

Schoenick, just when they're trying to make

contact with us.

(to Bud)

I think I'm reaching him.

LINDSEY

See?

MONK

I'm the least of your problems.

BUD

Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?

JAMMER

Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that

angel comin' toward me.

BUD

Uh, okay, right.  You can tell us about it

later.  Let's go.

CUT TO:

BUD

He's jammed the mechanism.

LINDSEY

Now what?

BUD

Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get

inside, get the door open from the other side.

LINDSEY

Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above

freezing.

BUD

Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?

CATFISH

Wish us luck.

(hands his wallet to Hippy)

'Case I don't die.  Okay, Bud... let's go,

podner, I ain't got all day.

BUD

Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.

CATFISH

I can't... make it... podner.

BUD

Okay, Cat.  You head back.

HIPPY

He can't get to the door... I think he's going

to try and take him himself.

LINDSEY

He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained

killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling

One Night over laundry duty.

LINDSEY

BUUUUUD!!

LINDSEY

NOOO!!

MONK

I tool the liberty of removing this before I

gave it back to him.

CATFISH

Hey!

BUD

(to Catfish)

Get the door!

CATFISH

SHOOT!

CATFISH

Safety's on!  On the side... the lever!  Up,

push it up!

HIPPY

SHIT!

CATFISH

Give me that!!

LINDSEY

Forget that... go for Big Geek!

BUD

Gimme a hand!

BUD

Get the rest of my gear.  Grab that hat there...

let's go guys!  Come on, come on!

BUD

Helmet... helmet!  Work fast.

ONE NIGHT

I'll unhook.

(Lindsey hesitates)

GO!  You're better in these than I am.

LINDSEY (V.O.)

Get in!

LINDSEY

You owe me one, Virgil.

BUD

Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.

BUD

Go after it!  We gotta catch it!

LINDSEY

You did okay, back there.  I was fairly

impressed.

BUD

Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.

LINDSEY

Not in this thing.

BUD

You totaled it, huh?

LINDSEY

Yeah.  So sue me.

BUD

It's flooding like a son of the bitch.

LINDSEY

You noticed.

LINDSEY

Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over.

BUD

Try again.

LINDSEY

Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance,

over.  Deepcore, this--

LINDSEY

Well, that's that.

BUD

Wonderful.

(looking around)

There's some light from somewhere...

LINDSEY

Over there.  It's the rig.

BUD

Good hundred yards, I'd say.

LINDSEY

They'll come out after us.

BUD

Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find

us.  We better get this flooding stopped.

LINDSEY

You see where it's coming in?

BUD

Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.

BUD

Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off.

You go any tools?

LINDSEY

I don't know, look around.

BUD

Nothing.  Son of a bitch.  All I need's a goddamn

crescent wrench.

BUD

Son of a bitch!

LINDSEY

Calm down, Bud.

BUD

Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.

LINDSEY

How?

BUD

I don't know how!

LINDSEY

We've only got one suit.

BUD

I know!  I know!  But we better come up with

something.

LINDSEY

Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!

LINDSEY

Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back

with another suit.

BUD

Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough

time.  Look at this...

(the rate of flooding)

Time I get back you'll be--

BUD

Alright, put this on.

LINDSEY

What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You

got it on, keep it on.

BUD

Don't argue, goddamnit, just--

LINDSEY

No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.

BUD

Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--

LINDSEY

NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--

BUD

FUCK LOGIC!!

LINDSEY

Listen... will you listen to me for a second!?

You're for the suit on and you're a better

swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...

BUD

What's the plan?

LINDSEY

I drown, you tow me back to the rig--

BUD

WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??

LINDSEY

Look, this water is only a couple degrees above

freezing.  I drown.  I go into deep hypothermia...

my blood like icewater.  I can maybe be revived

after ten, fifteen minutes.  You got all the

stuff to do it on the rig.

BUD

It is insane.

LINDSEY

It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.

BUD

Jesus, I don't believe this is happening.

BUD

Oh God, Lins... I--

LINDSEY

Tell me later.

LINDSEY

This is maybe not such a great plan, is it?

LINDSEY

Hold me.  Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared...

BUD

NOOOOO!!!

CUT TO:

ONE NIGHT

It's Bud.  Oh my God... that's Lindsey!

BUD (V.O./faint)

Deepcore, Deepcore, do you read?

HIPPY

Read you, Bud.  We're here.

BUD

Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen...

de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc

syringe... and some... heating blankets.

You got all that?

HIPPY (V.O.)

Got it. Over.

BUD

Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.

SONNY

Here he comes!

BUD

Turn her over!

BUD

Come on, hurry!  Gimme the de-fib...

CATFISH

Here, here, here... no, you got to have bare

skin, or it won't...

BUD

Jesus.  Gimme those, come on.  Catfish, move it,

man!  Come on... come on!

BUD

Is that it?  Is this right?

HIPPY

Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.

BUD

All right.  Do it!

BUD

Do it again, One Night.  Zap her again!

BUD

Aw.  Christ... come on, baby.  Again!  Do it

again!

BUD

Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?

CATFISH

(gently)

Bud, it's over, man.  It's over.

BUD

No!  NO!  She's not... her heart is strong,

she wants to live... can't you see that?  Come

on, Lins.  Come on, baby!  Zap her again!  Do

it... DO IT!

BUD

Come on, breath!  Goddamn it, you bitch, you

never backed down from anything in life... now

fight!

BUD

Fight, Goddamnit!

BUD

FIGHT!!

BUD

Come on, Lins.  You can do it... fight your

way back, baby...

BUD

(a whisper, fierce and harsh)

You did it, ace.

DISSOLVE TO:

LINDSEY

Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?

BUD

Hi, lady.

LINDSEY

Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?

BUD

'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you?

How d'you feel.

LINDSEY

I've been better.  Next time it's your turn,

okay?

BUD

Well, you got that right.

CUT TO:

LINDSEY

No, Bud, no... not you.

BUD

Who then?

BUD (muffled)

So I'll hear you, but I can't talk?

MONK

The fluid prevents your larynx from making

sound.  It'll feel a little strange.

BUD (muffled)

Warning you now, folks, I'm a lousy typist.

(a beat)

The moment of truth, huh?

BUD

Okay.  Let's rock and roll.

MONK

Relax now, Bud.  Just keep breathing as it

fills... don't fight it.  Take it in.  Just let

yourself take it in.

MONK

Hold him.  Hold him.  This is normal... it'll

pass in a second.  You're gonna be okay.  We all

breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.  Your body

will remember.

LINDSEY

Can you hear me okay?

(another thumbs up)

Try your keypad.

LINDSEY

I already have, moron.

HIPPY

I redid Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek!

He should take you right to it.  All you gotta

do is hang on!

LINDSEY (V.O.)

We're right here with you, Bud.  Your depth is

3800 feet.  You're doing fine.

MONK

4800 feet.  It's official.

LINDSEY

Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record

for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think

you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.

HIPPY

One mile down and still grinnin'.

LINDSEY

8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?

MONK

Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision

problems, euphoria.

LINDSEY

Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.

LINDSEY

Big baby.

MONK

It's starting.  It hits the nervous system

first.

ONE NIGHT

Keep talking, Lindsey.  Just let him hear your

voice.  It doesn't matter what about.

LINDSEY

Don't forget Bud, you're being graded on spelling

as well as sentence structure, so concentrate,

okay?

(long pause)

Bud, I... uh, there's some things I want to say.

It's hard for me.  I'm not of those softy, gooey-

center-type people.  It's not easy, you know,

being a cast-iron bitch.  It takes discipline

and years of training.  A lot of people don't

appreciate that.

LINDSEY

But is wasn't all bad.  I know that.  You

remember that bike trip... we rode the Honda

up through Oregon?  It took me a week to get my

hair untangled, but I've never been happier.  It

was the most... free... I've ever felt.  I'm

sorry I can't tell you these things to your face.

LINDSEY (V.O./filtered)

It's pitiful.  I have to wait until you're

freezing in the dark and there's ten thousand

feet of water between us.  I guess I'm babbling.

I'm sorry.

HIPPY

Two miles down and still grinnin'  Comin' up on

the big ten thou'.

ONE NIGHT

Bottom's still a mile and a half down.

HIPPY

12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing

this.

LINDSEY

Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?

HIPPY

Uh, oh...

LINDSEY

What kind of luminous things, Bud?

CATFISH

Maybe it's... you know... them.

MONK

He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.

LINDSEY

Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate.

Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.

LINDSEY

I'm not going away, Bud.  I'm right here, right

here with you.  This is Lindsey, Bud.  I'm right

here.

ONE NIGHT

Signal's fading.

HIPPY

We're losing juice... kill everything we don't

need.  Catfish, knock out those lights.

ONE NIGHT

Run it through the digital processor, cook it as

much as you can.

CATFISH

Seventeen thousand feet.  Good Christ Almighty,

this is insane.

ONE NIGHT

Little Geek just folded.

HIPPY

Bye, little buddy.

MONK

He can still make it.

LINDSEY

I know how alone you feel... alone in all that

cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark

with you, Bud you're not alone...

LINDSEY (V.O.)

You remember that time, you were pretty drunk,

you probably don't remember... the power went

out at the old apartment, the one on Orange

Street... and we were staring at that one little

candle, and I said something really dumb like

that candle is me, like every one of us is out

there alone in the dark in this life...

LINDSEY

... and you lit another candle and put it beside

mine and said "that's me"... and we stared at

the two candles, and then we... well, if you

remember any of it, I'm sure you remember the

next part.  Bud, there are two candles in the

dark.  I'm with you.  I'll always be with you.

CATFISH

How you doin', podner?  Still with us, come-back?

Talk to us, Buddy boy.

LINDSEY

Bud?  You hangin' in there?  Talk to me, Bud.

Are you okay?

LINDSEY

What kind of light?

MONK

He's hallucinating badly.

MONK

Okay, Bud, we'll go step by step.  Take the

cover plate off the firing box.

MONK

All right, Bud, you have to cut the ground wire,

not the lead wire...

MONK (V.O.)

It's the blue wire with the white stripe, not...

I repeat... NOT the black wire with the yellow

stripe.

LINDSEY

Would we see the flash?

MONK

Through three miles of water?   I don't know.

CATFISH

Quiet, quiet!  Save you air, goddamnit.

MONK

Bud, give me a reading off you liquid oxygen

gauge.

HIPPY

It took him over an hour to get down there--

LINDSEY

Drop you weights and start back now!  The gauge

could be wrong...

LINDSEY

No!  You can make it!  You hear me?  Drop your

weights... you... can breathe shallow... you...

it could be wrong--

LINDSEY

Oh God, Virgil, please...

LINDSEY

Love you.

CUT TO:

BUD

Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'?

BUD

You watch out TV?  That what you're trying to

say?  That you know what's been going on up

there?

REPORTER

... a Caltech scientist who is among those

reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the

world's oceans.  Dr. Breg, can you give us a

clearer explanation then we're getting?

BERG

They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but

with no seismological source.  The waves are

propagating toward the shorelines of every

continent--

BERG

Yeah.  I'll be right there... I have to go.

Look, we don't know what it is!  Okay?  Not the

slightest goddamn idea!

BUD

You're doing it!  Right?  That's what you're

telling me.  Yeah, you can control water...

that's your technology.  But why?

BUD

Hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it.

Where do you get off passing judgment on us,

when you can't be sure?  How do you know?

CUT TO:

REPORTER

The horizon has gone dark... the crowd is starting

to run... some are just staring, unable to

move... the wave... the wave is... it's...

I don't know... maybe a thousand feet high

already... getting bigger as I'm watching...

still miles out... oh my God, Jesus... I can

hear it...

GUY

Somebody just laid it down to us, man.  Things

ain't never gonna be the same!

BUD

Why?  You could've done it.  Why didn't you?

CUT TO:

MCBRIDE (V.O.)

Deepcore, do you read?  This is Benthic Explorer,

over.

CATFISH

Hell yes, we read!  Good of you to join us.  How's

that storm doin'?

MCBRIDE

Well, it's strange... it just kind've blew

itself out all of the sudden.  We're up here in

a flat sea with no wind.  But then a lot of weird

things've been happening.

CATFISH

Well, hell, son.  You better get us a line down

here, we're in moderately poor shape.

MCBRIDE

They figure is was over a half mile high.

ONE NIGHT

I wish I could have seen it--

ONE NIGHT

Hey.  Hey!  HEY!!  Look... it's Bud.

MONK

That's impossible.

LINDSEY

No it's not.

MCBRIDE (V.O.)

What's it say?

LINDSEY

It says...

"VIRGIL BRIGMAN BACK ON THE AIR/HAVE SOME NEW

FRIENDS DOWN HERE/I GUESS THEYVE BEEN HERE AWHILE/

THEYVE LEFT US ALONE BUT IT BOTHERS THEM TO SEE

US HURTING EACH OTHER/GETTING OUT OF HAND LATELY"

LINSEY

"THEY SENT A MESSAGE/HOPE YOU GOT IT"

CATFISH

I'd say that's a big 10-4, jack.

LINDSEY

"THEY WANT US TO GROW UP A BIT AND PUT AWAY

CHILDISH THINGS/OF COURSE ITS JUST A SUGGESTION."

MCBRIDE

Looks like you boys might by out of business.

BENDIX

Something's going on down there.  I'm getting

some big readings....

ONE NIGHT

Whew!  Whatever this is, it's major.

CUT TO:

BENDIX

Active is pinging back something big... it's

enormous!  Coming up right under us.

DEMARCO

Where?

BENDIX

Where?  EVERYWHERE!!

(looks out the window)

Over there!  Port bow.

BENDIX

Look...

LINDSEY

We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.

CATFISH

Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook-

up Coke.

HIPPY

They must've done something to us.

LINDSEY

Oh, yes.  I think you could say that.

LINDSEY

Hello, Brigman.

BUD

Hello, Mrs. Brigman.

CUT TO BLACK
