JEB

This cold war's heating up. Where did

they come from?

Hell. And we're going to send them

back screaming.

CUT TO:

VO

Imagine an end to world hunger. What

if ample food and clean drinking water

were the birthright of all our

planet's children?

VO

This man, professor John Robinson,

inventor of the faster than light

hyperdrive can make that timeless

dream a reality.

VO

John Robinson and his family have been

extensively trained to take a ten year

journey across the galaxy in the

world's most advanced spacecraft,

The Jupiter.

VO

From a distant world, the Robinsons,

Will bring back a miracle...

VO

Dimondium can turn even worthless sand

to fertile soil. Earth WILL be a

garden. What kind of - future can our

children look forward to?

V0

A future without hunger. A future

without suffering. Heaven on Earth.

V0

This mission sponsored by the US Army

and the Coca-Cola corporation.

WILL

Coke. Saving the world for our

children.

(a beat)

Give me a hi-test break.

PRINCIPAL

He hacked our main power grid to run

his experiment. The school was in

chaos. We didn't even have lights.

PRINCIPAL (OVER)

This is no laughing matter, Mrs.

Robinson. Will is terribly gifted. His

little time machines, though pure

fancy, are the products of a truly

brilliant mind.

WILL

The changing shape of education.

MAUREEN

No more monkey business.

PRINCIPAL

The boy is starved for attention. Was

there no way his father could have

attended the science fair?

JOHN

Once we have landed on Alpha Prime our

on board robot will begin construction

of a hypergate.

JOHN

By then, technicians here on Earth

will have completed a companion

hypergate in our planet's orbit.

JOHN

Once both gates are complete, ships

will be able to pass instantaneously

between them. The Jupiter can bring

the Dimondium back to Earth without

the ten year delay of a return trip.

REPORTER

Why can't you just use the Jupiter's

hyperengine to zap straight to Alpha

Prime?

JOHN

As you know, hyperspace exists beneath

normal space. If you try to enter

hyperspace without a gate

JOHN

Your exit vector is random. There's no

telling where you'd come out.

REPORTER

Professor, how is Captain Daniels

recovering from the flu? Will we still

be able to pilot the mission?

GENERAL

Ladies and Gentlemen, you came to get

a look at the Jupiter One. Don't you

think you've waited long enough?

REPORTER (OVER)

Professor, how does your family feel

about leaving the Earth behind....

JOHN (OVER)

They couldn't be more excited.

PENNY (OVER)

This whole mission sucks!

PENNY

I Don't want to stay home for dinner.

I want to see my friends for the last

time.

PENNY

... On the eve before she is torn from

her friends, kidnapped, hurled into

deep space against her will, what

thoughts fill the mind of the young

Space Captive....

WILL

Will there be boys on Alpha Centuri?

What will I wear?

PENNY

When we wake up in ten years the video

journals of Penny Robinson, Space

Captive, will be devoured by millions.

I will be world famous. You on the

other hand, will have been totally

forgotten.

PENNY

The Space Captive has decided to wear

ribbons of support for fellow

sufferers as she is dragged into deep

space, green for the ecological

issues, white for human rights

WILL

You'd probably gag if I described the

secondary infections loss of

circulation can cause.

WILL

What are you grinning at?

PENNY

I just found an upside to this

mission. The thought of jettisoning

your body into deep space.

WILL

Dad says Don't bring them. Like

anything I do matters to him.

PENNY

He never showed, huh?

WILL

Maybe if I had actually broken the

time barrier he would have paid

attention.

PENNY

Don't let him get to you, kiddo. He

just gets busy with work is all.

WILL

So, that's a no to family dinner?

PENNY

Let's see, do I spend my last night on

Earth watching Mom and Dad pretend not

to be fighting again or get in ten

years of making-out at the mall ...

you do the math.

WILL

Mom's gonna go thermal.

PENNY

What's she gonna do. Ground me?

JOHN

We're lucky they didn't press on

Daniels, condition.

GENERAL

I figured a chance to look at the ship

would keep the dogs at bay.

JOHN

Ben, I'm worried about jamming in a

replacement pilot at the last second.

My family' a on this mission. I need

someone who's more than just spit and

polish.

GENERAL

I've got your man. He just doesn't

know it yet.

GENERAL

At ease, Major.

WEST

Sir, why was I pulled off active duty?

I salvaged my craft and Jeb's. I'll

fight a court martial, General.

GENERAL

Do you know Professor Robinson?

WEST

By reputation only.

(to John)

Your father's battle strategies were

required reading at the Academy.

GENERAL

How much do you know about the Jupiter

Mission, Major?

WEST

The Jupiter is fully automated. The

pilot flies the ship out of the solar

system and lands on Alpha Prime. It's

a baby sitting job, sir.

GENERAL

Major, you are aware Earth's resources

are severely limited.

WEST

Every schoolchild knows our recycling

technologies will save the

environment. Sending a family across

the galaxy is a publicity stunt to

sell soda to people of all ages.

GENERAL

What I am about to tell you is

classified. Every schoolchild

has been lied to. The recycling

technologies have failed. In

less than two decades Earth will be

unable to support human life.

GENERAL

We spun the ad campaign to give the

mission a friendly face, keep people

from panicking in the streets. We

partnered with Coke because the 900

billion this mission cost would have

bankrupted the government. The

SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth

as well as we do. They hope to reach

Alpha Prime first - And if they do,

I guarantee you, they will not share

the Dimondium with Western Demons like

us. our crops will wither. We will be

left to die.

WEST

...Captain Daniels doesn't have the

flu, does he sir?

GENERAL

Daniels was murdered in his apartment

last night. The flu story is a cover

we fed the press.

WEST

Dan was a good pilot. A good man.

GENERAL

Your rescue stunt over Mars was

foolhardy. Explain yourself, Major.

WEST

I had a friend in trouble.

GENERAL

You endangered a one billion dollar

spacecraft, disobeyed a direct order

because of a friend?

WEST

Yes sir. And I'd do it again. Sir.

JOHN

He'll do.

(stepping forward)

GENERAL

Congratulations Major, you're the new

pilot of the Jupiter mission.

MAN

Perhaps a brief jaunt down memory

lane is required. I was contracted

to provide Daniels, apartment code.

My work is done.

BUSINESSMAN

They found a replacement pilot, the

mission is going ahead on schedule.

MAN

How tragic. For you.

BUSINESSMAN

We require more direct intervention.

MAN

I see. Well, that will cost you. And,

I'm afraid my price has just become

... astronomical.

TECHNICIAN

Control hasn't received the results

of your final pre-flight exams,

Doctor Smith.

SMITH

The Robinsons are checked out at one

hundred percent. They are in perfect

condition and ready to fly.

SMITH

Wish them good luck for me.

GENERAL (OVER)

The mission protocols are simple.

Professor Robinson is in command

unless you encounter a military

emergency. In that case, Major West,

you will assume command.

JOHN (OVER)

Welcome aboard, Major.

JOHN

Some of this technology might be new

to you. I'll be happy to explain.

WEST

(off the com)

Cold fusion drive

(off the size consoles)

Rambler-Krey Life Sciences stations.

WEST

Holographic navigational interface.

WEST

Cryosleep array. Fully monitored.

WEST

Sick bay, remote Ops, engineering and

living quarters are below decks.

Hyperengine should be in here.

JOHN

If you have to baby sit, it's not

such a bad nursery, wouldn't you

agree, Major?

DOCTOR

The cryosleep systems are running at

ninety five percent.

GENERAL

Doctor Smith approved the specs-

DOCTOR

Doctor Smith is base physician. I am

responsible once this ship is in

flight. These tubes have to keep the

crew in suspended animation for ten

years. They will be perfect or this

ship will not launch. Is that clear?

GENERAL

Absolutely, Doctor.

JOHN

Judy, I'd like you to meet Major

West. He's taking Mike's place.

DOCTOR

He's heavier than Mike. We'll have to

re-calibrate.

WEST

I'd be more than happy to discuss my

dimensions perhaps over dinner?

DOCTOR

West - I've read about you. Something

of a war hero, aren't you?

WEST

(preening )

Well, yes, actually.

DOCTOR

Those who can't think, fight.

(a freezing smile)

Well, nice to have met you.

WEST

That's one cold fish I'd love to

thaw.

JUDY

(turning)

I'm not going to make it home for

dinner, Dad.

WEST

It's going to be a long flight.

MAUREEN (OVER)

He won first prize again. He

practically brought down his entire

school. But he won first prize.

JOHN

A non-working prototype for his time

machine. Sharp stuff for a midget.

JOHN

I'm sorry about dinner. I had to work

late. The new pilot-.

MAUREEN

What you had to do was prioritize

your family over the mission

JOHN

Maureen. This mission is about our

family. So we can stay together

MAUREEN

The perfect nuclear family. The most

stable social unit, ideally suited

for the isolation of a long journey

into space. It's all just PR, John.

You're never home. Judy is

becoming a ghost just like you. Penny

can't see past her own navel and Will

has to black out-his school, just to

get his father's attention. The

perfect nuclear family in ruin.

JOHN

I know, Maureen. I'm scared too.

LOADING TECHNICIAN

Anything else?

LOADING TECHNICIAN #2

I'm showing a late shipment from

Mission Medical. Smith's

authorization. Here it is now.

SMITH

You'll forgive me if I forgo the

kiss, my sleeping behemoth.

SMITH

But the time has come to awake.

ROBOT

Robot is on-line. Reviewing primary

directives. One, preserve the

Robinson Family. Two, Maintain ship

systems. Three

SMITH

Spare me the chatter.

SMITH

What noble charges my steely

centurion. Sadly I fear you have far

more dire deeds in store for you.

ROBOT

Robot is on-line. Reviewing primary

directives. Two hours into mission

destroy Robinson family. Destroy all

systems.

SMITH

Now that's more like it. Farewell my

tin-plated pal. Give my regards to

oblivion.

SMITH

I told you never to call me here.

BUSINESSMAN

I see you have completed your mission

on schedule Good work, Doctor. And

goodbye.

PENNY

Don't, mom. Vogue says this will be

the style in ten years.

WILL

Will she wake up less annoying?

PENNY

Does he have to wake up at all?

MAUREEN

Alright you two, enough.

MAUREEN

You get a C in paternal expression,

Professor. But an A for effort.

MAUREEN

You always get an A in that.

JUDY

Don't let me shatter this unbridled

display of affection, but we are

running behind.

JOHN

(entering his tube)

Major, she's all yours.

WEST

I'll try to give you a smooth ride.

JUDY

Mission control this is Dr. Robinson.

We are in the green.

MISSION CONTROL (OVER)

Roger, Doctor, you are go to initiate

cryostasis.

WEST

One question, Doctor. in there room

in these tubes for two?

JUDY

Barely enough for you and your ego,

Major. Drive carefully.

(touches her com-link)

initializing cryostasis tubes.

WEST

Mission Control, this is Jupiter One.

The Robinsons are asleep. We are

ready to fly.

NOAH

Mom, look, it's Doctor Smith.

MAUREEN

Pulse, respiration and bleeding-

Basic triage, lock down and

stabilize. I know the drill.

WEST

NEXT picnic, no robots.

WEST

Communications links are down.

MAUREEN

Life support is at ten percent.

Trying to bring secondary systems on

fearless as she...

PENNY

I want to go home now.

WEST

Rerouting power from the secondary

couplings. Try it again.

MAUREEN

Finding a power tap....

MAUREEN

Life support is back on line.

WEST

I can't get the blast shields open.

We're flying blind.

PENNY

I've got life signs.

Boy, somebody could use a breath

mint.

WEST

(to John)

Try the emergency back-ups.

WEST

Smith, what the hell-

SMITH

I was making a last minute check ...

someone hit me from behind.

WEST

Sino-Jordanian technology. You're a

Goddamned spy.

(realizing)

You did this.

SMITH

Stop. What are you doing?

WEST

Dropping some extra weight.

MAUREEN (OVER)

Help, somebody. Please.

MAUREEN

The thawing engine in broken. can't

get her out. She's dying.

SMITH

Touch me and the girl dies.

SMITH

Your mission physician is indisposed.

I can save her life. But only if you

spare mine.

WEST

I Don't deal with dead men.

SMITH

Kill me, I kill the girl. How much is

your revenge worth, Major? I will, of

course, need your word as an officer

that you will let me live.

WEST

Help her.

JOHN

I've got a com signal.

RADIO

...Is Mission Control. Do you read?

Jupiter Two this is

JOHN

Emergency power's on line. I think I

can get these blast shields open.

WEST

Uh-oh.

NOAH

Give me a telemetry projection.

NOAH (OVER)

You're way off course. We show you in

the sun's gravitational pull.

WEST

How long do we have?

NOAH (OVER)

We count seven minutes before your

outer hull begins to melt.

WEST

I'm going to try for the Mercury

Mines.

SMITH

I will need Dr. Robinson's portable

gurney. I believe it is stored in-

PENNY

I'm on it.

MAUREEN

We trusted you.

(sinking in)

You tried to kill us all.

SMITH

Existence offers us nothing if not

the opportunity for an endless series

of betrayals.

(off her stunned expression)

There's a world behind the world,

Professor Robinson. Lie once, cheat

twice and everything becomes clear.

Do not mistake my deception for a

character flaw. It is philosophical

choice, a profound understanding of

the universe. It is a way of life.

MAUREEN

You're a monster.

SMITH

Perhaps. But I am also the only one

who can save your daughter's life.

MAUREEN

Where's Will?

PENNY

He's futzing with that Robot.

SMITH

Alright, Penny dear, I need you to

short the power on my command.

PENNY

Does he have to call me dear?

SMITH

Professor, if you will assist me in

lowering the body.

SMITH

Penny, dear. Now.

MAUREEN

We're losing her.

JOHN

I've re-routed all secondary systems

She won't budge. Shortest baby sitting

mission I've ever done.

JOHN

My family's not going die in space.

WEST

I'm open to suggestions.

MAUREEN

Judy? Baby?

JUDY

You should try to look less worried.

It has a tendency to spook the

patients.

MAUREEN

(to Smith)

Thank you.

SMITH

You are a good woman, Maureen. Any man

could see that. I hope I have proven

the well-being of your family is of

great importance to me. Perhaps, if

you convinced your husband to trust

me...

MAUREEN

Stabilize her, Smith. Because you only

breathe as long as she does.

COMPUTER

Heat seal breach in 20 seconds.

JOHN

There's got to be some way to get

through this.

WEST

That's it.

JOHN

What's it?

WEST

We can't get away from the sun. So we

have to go through it.

The hyperdrive -

JOHN

Engage the hyperdrive without a gate,

we could be thrown anywhere in the

galaxy

WEST

Anywhere but here.

ANNIE

We're getting resident radiation

distortions from the space craft. She

must be breaking up.

NOAH

Let me see those numbers, Annie.

NOAH

Son of a bitch. He's powering up the

hyperdrive.

WEST

Hyperengines coming on line.

COMPUTER

Warning. Heat shield breach.

JOHN

Hyperdrive at 100 percent. Major, you

have the Com.

WEST

Zero to 20 million miles a second in

under a minute. Let's see what this

baby can do.

ANNIE

We can't keep a fix on her, sir. She's

starting to disappear.

NOAH

Godspeed.

JOHN

Is everyone okay?

MAUREEN

All in one piece. Although Major West

has the most puzzling definition of a

smooth ride.

JOHN

Judy? Where's Judy?

JUDY

Boy either I cut down on the coffee

or sew in a flap. It's hell getting

in and out of this thing.

JOHN

Are you-

JUDY

Vitals are normal. Pulse and

respiration seem to be-

JOHN

Baby, are you okay?

JUDY

I'm fine Daddy really.

SMITH

Will every disaster be an excuse for

familial sentiment? Please tell me

now so I may gather up a liberal

supply of space sickness bags.

MAUREEN

What happened, John? Where are we?

WEST

You had me worried, Doc. Nice to see

you thawed.

JUDY

Smart maneuver with the hyper-drive.

WEST

A fighter who thinks, what do you

know? You're just in time for the

show.

WEST

Computer, map our current location.

JOHN

See anything familiar?

COMPUTER

Searching for recognizable

constellations.

(a beat)

Unable to locate.

JOHN

This computer has star maps of the

entire known galaxy.

PENNY

We're lost, aren't we?

WEST

What the hell is that?

JOHN

Any effect on the ship?

WEST

No.

JOHN

(off the navigational hologram)

All the planets have moved.

WEST

And where did that come from?

WEST

It's gone.

JOHN

No. Go back in front of it.

JOHN

It's a hole in space. A doorway.

WEST

A doorway to where?

JOHN

If we want to reach that ship, we're

going to have to find out.

MAUREEN

No apparent effects on the ship.

WEST

I'm hailing on all frequencies. No

response.

JOHN

There are some markings on the

starboard side. Can you throw some

light on her?

WEST

Don't know if the exterior spots are

working.- There we go.

WEST

If this in all a dream, why can't

there be more girls?

WEST

I've never seen a design like this.

what are those scales on her hull?

JOHN

How could Earth launch a ship this

massive and neither of us know about

it? ... It just doesn't make sense.

WEST

These scanners are damaged, I'm

getting inconsistent life signs but

they may be sensor ghosts.

JOHN

Maybe her computer's still up. I'm

trying standard remote access codes.

WEST

What do you know?

JOHN

Can you give me some light on the

secondary docking ring?

WEST

What do you make of that?

MAUREEN

Boys, I think we're having a close

encounter.

ROBOT (OVER)

Crush.

ROBOT

Crush! Kill! Destroy!

WILL

Crush. Kill. Destroy.

ROBOT

Crush! Kill! Destroy!

WILL

I hacked into his CPU, bypassed his

main operating system and accessed

his sub-routines. He's basically

running on remote control.

PENNY

Show off.

PENNY

And so the Space Captive finds

herself helping the Robinsons by

guarding the traitor. And she finds-

PENNY

She finds that out here, in the dark

and cold, she's scared, and she's

kind of glad they're all together.

PENNY

Identify yourself, soldier.

WEST

West, Major, United Space Force,

requesting permission to see the

prisoner.

PENNY

Proceed Major West.

PENNY

Ouch. Could he be cuter? I don't

think so.

SMITH

These quarters are totally

unacceptable. I demand-

WEST

We're going to check out the probe

ship. Maybe we can figure out how

they got here. And how to get home.

SMITH

Ta-ta. Have a wonderful trip.

WEST

You're coming with us.

SMITH

Out of the question. I'm a doctor not

a space explorer. You and-

WEST

What you are is a murderous saboteur

and I am not leaving you on this ship

so you can do more harm than you've

already caused.

SMITH

I absolutely refuse-

WEST

(closer)

Give me an excuse to kill you.

Please.

SMITH

Silver always was my color.

WILL

When boarding a mysterious

spacecraft, it always pays to look

your best.

JOHN

Deactivate safety.

GUN

Voiceprint confirmed. Rifle is

active.

JOHN

You did a good job up there son. You

saved us all.

WILL

Thanks.

JOHN

I know I haven't around much these

days.That we haven't had time to-

WEST (OVER)

Professor, we're ready.

JOHN

Will, you're the most important thing

in the world to me. I hope one day

you'll be able to see that.

WILL

Take care of my dad, okay Robot?

JUDY

The air is stale. Old.

SMITH

That's the smell of ghosts.

WEST

I'm interfacing with the on board

computer... Odd.

JOHN

Not working?

WEST

No, it's just, I don't know, too

fast. Most of the systems are down.

JUDY

Motion sensors are still working.

WEST (OVER)

What do you make of this?

JOHN

Some kind of hieroglyphics.

JUDY

If I didn't know better I'd say this

is blood.

SMITH

I know an omen when I see one. I

suggest a hasty retreat.

WEST

Just imagine we're retreating in the

opposite direction. Now, move it.

WILL

Dad, do you....

ROBOT

... Hear something?

SMITH

Like the drip, drip, drip of blood..

WEST

You really need to shut up.

JOHN

(pointing)

Here.

JUDY

That material appears biological.

SMITH

Nothing good will come of this.

WEST

What makes you such an expert?

SMITH

Trust me, Major. Evil knows evil.

JOHN

Let's find the bridge. Maybe we can

get some answers.

PENNY

Try it now, Mom.

PENNY

Damn.

JUDY

What the hell happened in here?

WEST

Some kind of fire fight. Look at this

technology. I've seen some of this

before. On the drawing boards.

JOHN

Can you bring up the Captain's log?

WEST

The data has degraded. I'm going try

and gather any fragments I can. There

isn't much, but ... here we go.

WEST

Jeb.

JEB

The hyperspace tracker seems to be

functioning...

(static)

No sign of the Jupiter Two...

JEB

(static)

Have exceeded our mission timetable

by two...

(static)

I'm not willing to give up. Don would

keep looking for me.

WEST

That's it. The rest of the data is

totally corrupted.

WEST

This doesn't make sense. How could

they launch a rescue mission for us

when we've only been lost a day?

JUDY

I've got something here.

JUDY

They brought it up from the planet's

surface. It's seems to be some sort

of egg sack.

WEST

Smith, step away from there.

SMITH

Happy to oblige, Major. Although I

don't think it's me you should be

worrying about. But rather this.

WILL

I'm detecting motion. Behind you...

JOHN

After it. Move.

(to the Robot)

Bring Smith.

WEST

This explains where all the plants

came from.

JUDY

Growth like this would take decades.

SMITH

Unhand me, you mechanical moron.

WEST

Don't move.

SMITH

I am sick of your terrorism. If you

are going to kill me, be done with

it. Otherwise I will insist you treat

me with the respect and-

WEST

(like steel)

I said don't move.

WILL

Neat.

JUDY

Well, who do we have here?

WEST

Easy there, little buddy. No one's

going to hurt you.

SMITH

How do you know it won't hurt us?

JUDY

Looks like you've made a friend. You

have a good bedside manner, Major.

WEST

I'm going to let that one go.

SMITH

How charming. Doctor Dolittle of

outer space.

JUDY

Where do you think it came from?

JOHN

It's possible this is one of the

creatures represented in the

hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It

must have been their ship attached to

the other docking ring.

WEST

It looks like a child.

SMITH

If so, my dear Major, what do you

suppose happened to its parents?

JOHN

Let's get back to the bridge.

PENNY

I think I've got it.

MAUREEN

That's strange.

PENNY

Those scales are giving off heat.

JOHN

I've tapped into the internal sensor

array. Besides us, this ship is

totally deserted.

SMITH

A ghost ship.

WEST

And the flavor of the day is ...

banana/beef. Who thinks up these

combinations?

WEST

MM. Good.

SMITH

Major West, I highly recommend you

never breed. That by the way is my

medical opinion.

WEST

Little thing was hungry.

SMITH

Good Lord, who will - spare us the

tyranny of the sentimental?

PENNY

Do you hear something?

SMITH

Get this infernal creature off me.

WEST

This can't be good.

SMITH

You have a remarkably keen sense

of the obvious.

MAUREEN

John, get the hell out of there.

MAUREEN

Give me an external view.

JOHN

Evacuate. Now!

WILL

This joy stick is too slow. Activate

holographic interface.

JUDY

They eat their wounded.

JOHN

Which way?

WILL

Turn left.

ROBOT

Now right.

JOHN

Got to seal the bulkhead.

WEST

The door control is at the other and

of the corridor.

JUDY

The fire sensor.

SMITH

Open, damn you.

WEST

It's cycling a vacuum check. There is

no way to speed up the protocols.

SMITH

Fools. I warned you not to come

aboard this cursed craft. You've

killed us. You've killed us all.

JUDY

Shut up.

WEST

Now that's a bedside manner.

WILL

Charge.

JOHN

Will, get the Robot in here.

WILL

I can't move him without letting the

spiders into the ship.

JOHN

Leave him behind.

WILL

I'm sorry, Robot.

JOHN

Seal it. Now!

JOHN

Get us out of here.

SMITH

Get this cloying gargoyle off of me.

JOHN

Get me an external view.

JOHN

Prepare to disengage.

PENNY

Get it off me. Get it off.

WEST

Initiating separation.

PENNY

It's okay. Everything's going to be

alright.

WEST

We're clear. Everybody hang on.

JUDY

I think those things were using the

probe ship as a way to trap food.

WEST

That I s probably what happened to

the monkey's parents. We were going

to be desert.

MAUREEN

But what happened to the crew?

JOHN

Nothing good.

WEST

We're not out of the woods yet.

WEST

Let's see how these monsters like a

hundred thousand volts.

WEST

And the crowd goes wild.

SMITH

Recall your nightmares from

childhood, Major. Monsters are rarely

so easily dissuaded.

WEST

Persistent bastards.

JOHN

Can you hit them again?

WEST

Every time I electrify the hull, I'm

draining our systems. Once or twice

more and we're going to be dead in

space.

SMITH

A fate I fear may be inevitable one

way or another.

JOHN

That's the same expression you had

when my mother came to stay with us.

MAUREEN

DNA extrapolation - coming up.

Silicone based. Admantium shell and

lack of respiratory system suggest an

ability to live in deep space. Tiny

front brain implies communal

relationships. More like bees.

WEST

There are thousands of those things

MAUREEN

They may be attracted to heat and

light.

WEST

With the right command codes, I can

light up the probe ship from here.

WEST

Damn. No response.

JOHN

Command codes are sequenced. Try the next series.

WEST

But they won't work until the next

fleet of ships are built. That's at

least two years away.

JOHN

Just do it.

WEST

How did you know?

JOHN

Think about it, Don. The ships's

advanced technology. Your friend

looking old. What if that ship is

from our future?

COMPUTER

Warning. Outer hull has been

compromised.

MAUREEN

It's not working.

JOHN

Can you get the fusion drive on line?

WEST

Let's turn up the heat.

COMPUTER (OVER)

Warning. Inner hull breach in twenty

seconds.

JOHN

Give them a little encouragement.

WEST

Electrifying outer hull ... now.

JOHN

Get us out of here. Fast.

JOHN

What are you doing?

WEST

Never leave an enemy stronghold

intact. One of your father's first

rules of engagement.

JOHN

Don, stop. That's a direct order. We

might need to salvage-

WEST

This is a military emergency. That

means I'm in command.

JOHN

Don, no. I'm ordering you-

WEST

I hate spiders.

WEST

Hang on, it I a gonna be a bumpy

ride.

WEST

I can't hold her.

WEST

We're going down.

WEST

Can't get the stabilizers on line.

JOHN

Pull up. Pull up.

WEST

Really? No kidding? Thanks.

WEST

I'm reading a clearing ahead. I'm

going to try and make it.

WEST

Got to slow us down.

WEST

Brace for impact!

JOHN

Everybody, by the numbers.

MAUREEN

Life Sciences, still breathing.

JUDY

Mission medical, I'm alive.

WILL

Me too. Robotics, I mean.

PENNY

Video Mechanics, okay.

SMITH

I'm alive, Major West's poor excuse

for piloting skills not withstanding.

WEST

Let's take a look.

PENNY

I don't think we're in Kansas

anymore.

JOHN (OVER)

You violated a direct order.

WEST

About half the core material is

burned out. We'll never generate

enough power to break orbit.

JOHN

I told you not to blow that ship's

reactors and you did it anyway.

WEST

Come on, Professor, give it a rest. I

was technically still in command.

JOHN

Don't hand me that. I'm commander of

this mission.

WEST

Look, no offense, but you're an

egghead with an honorary rank. No one

ever intended you to handle combat

situations. You're spouting some

nonsense about- time travel while

those spiders posed a continuing

threat. I made a judgement call and

if I have to I'll make it again.

Hell, you of all people should

understand that. If your father were

here-

JOHN

My father is not here. My father is

dead, killed in one of his combat

missions you so admire. My family is

on this ship And you're going to

follow my orders. Whether you agree

with them or not. Is that clear,

Major?

WEST

Save the speeches. I like you. But

the fate of the Earth is at stake

here. I'm going to do whatever I

think it takes to ensure the success

of this mission. With or without your

help. Is that clear, Professor?

MAUREEN (OVER)

Am I interrupting something?

MAUREEN

No. Really. I think you two should go

ahead and slug it out. I mean, here

we are stranded on an alien world and

you boys want to get into a pissing

contest. So please, go for it. I'll

have Judy down here in a heartbeat to

declare you both unfit and I'll take

over this mission. Now I don't want

to hear another word from you two

until you can play nice. Is that

clear?

JOHN WEST

Maureen- Listen-

MAUREEN

Not another word.

(a beat)

Better. Now if you've finished hosing

down the decks with testosterone, I

suggest you come with me. I may have

found a way to get us off this

planet.

WEST

Wow.

JOHN

Tell me about it.

WILL

Can you hear me? Robot?

ROBOT

Systems error. Robot unable to

register neural net outputs. Unable

to locate motor controls. Unable-

WILL

Calm down. Your body was destroyed in

the conflict with the space spiders.

Do you remember?

ROBOT

Affirmative.

WILL

But I downloaded your neural net.

ROBOT

Robot tried to destroy the Robinson

family. Why would Will Robinson save

Robot's personality? Your actions do

not compute.

WILL

I guess sometimes friendship means

acting with your heart, not your

head.

ROBOT

Logic error. Friendship does not

compute.

WILL

Don't worry, Robot. Im going to build

you a new body. I promise.

WILL

Mom always said I should try to make

new friends.

MAUREEN

The atmosphere here can sustain human

life. I've located 500 Rads

radioactive material a mile north.

JOHN

That's at least what we'd need to get

the core functioning again.

JOHN

We'll set off at daybreak. it'll be

safer. Those are my orders, Major.

WEST

I agree with your recommendation,

Professor.

MAUREEN

DZtente is a beautiful thing.

PENNY

What's the diagnosis, Doc? Is it

cowboy or ballerina on Halloween?

JUDY

Right now she's a girl. But I think

your little pal here is from a

self-replicating species. At

different stages of life she, or he,

probably alternates sexes.

PENNY

Imagine the savings on dating outfits

alone.

PENNY

Can I keep her?

JUDY

Penny, you've never taken care of a

thing in your life besides yourself.

PENNY

Please. She's all alone. I promise

I'll look after her. She needs me.

JUDY

...The moment you misplace her, or

forget to feed her, we leave her on

this planet where she can live in the

wild. I'm not kidding Penny.

PENNY

We're both a long way from home,

aren't we little one?

PENNY

That's what we'll call you. Blip.

PENNY

You like that?

PENNY

Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

SMITH

Remove that lock this instant. I

shall not be caged like some animal

WEST

(lethal)

I gave my word I'd let you live. I

never said for how long.

SMITH

These quarters will be fine.

SMITH

Tell me, Major West. Are you really

confident in Robinson's ability to

guide us? If I were set free, I would

support your right to command. With

minimal force, we could take this

ship and assure this mission

continues under your leadership.

WEST

...My God Smith, you're right. How

could I have been so blind? I'll just

run and get you a gun so we can

hijack the ship. Okay?

SMITH

Sarcasm is the recourse of a weak

mind.

WEST

I'm hiding the pain. Really.

SMITH

I assure you, Major West. Your pain

has just begun.

WEST (OVER)

Star light, star bright...

JUDY

A million strange stars and only one

wish. I wish we were home.

JUDY

I never thought a sky could look so

alien. ...We really are lost.

WEST

When the first sailors circled the

globe and saw a brand new sky, they

thought they had sailed off the edge

of the earth. But they were really

just around the corner.

JUDY

(smiles)

We just billow our sails and let the

wind blow us home, Is that it Major?

WEST

So those sailors found familiar

shapes in the stars to make the skies

more friendly, to help them find

their way.

WEST

That's how constellations were born.

WEST

Porky the wise and mighty Pig.

JUDY

The great bucktoothed Bunny... Bugs.

WEST

So, my quarters or yours?

JUDY

Excuse me?

WEST

We are the only single man and woman

of consenting age in the galaxy. How

much more of a set up do you need?

JUDY

So you figure just dispense with the

pleasantries, get down to business?

WEST

You have a way with words, Doctor.

JUDY

(provocative)

Right here? On this console?

WEST

Here would be fine.

JUDY

Next time, fly slower.

JOHN

What was I thinking, bringing us all

out here into space?

MAUREEN

The world needed saving. You were the

right man for the job.

JOHN

But solving the world's problems

doesn't leave much time for the

people you love, does it?

MAUREEN

Did you get any time with Will?

JOHN

Now he's decided he can rebuild the

robot. Wants to show me his designs.

I've got too much to do-

MAUREEN

Funny creatures, men. You try so hard

not to be your fathers, end up making

the same mistakes. Will adores you.

He needs your attention.

JOHN

We can't get off this planet much

less back on course. I don't have

time to...

MAUREEN

John, just listen to him. it doesn't

matter what he's saying. Just listen.

Sometimes, at least in the eyes of

their fathers, little boys have to

come first.

JOHN

As soon as we get back into space,

we're going to spend some real time

together. I promise.

JOHN

What?

MAUREEN

It's nice to have our family under

one roof. Even if we had to go half

way across the galaxy to manage it.

JOHN

How would you feel about a little

late night tutorial, Professor?

MAUREEN

Mm. That's new. What are you doing?

JOHN

Going for extra credit.

MAUREEN (OVER)

Good night John.

JOHN (OVER)

Good night Maureen.

WILL (OVER)

Good night Judy.

PENNY (OVER)

Good night Will.

JUDY (OVER)

Good night Penny.

WEST (OVER)

You guys have got to be kidding.

WILL

Oh man.

PENNY

What are those rumblings? They've

been happening all morning.

JUDY

How can half the landscape have grown

up overnight?

JOHN

Okay, let's get settled. Maureen?

MAUREEN

It's impossible. But this planet's

geothermic plates don't match up.

JOHN

I was afraid of this.

JOHN

I think these tremors are the result

of opening and closing doorways.

PENNY

Doorways to where?

JOHN

The future.

SMITH

Perhaps the Professor was hit on the

head when we landed.

JOHN

Remember the portal that lead us to

the probe ship? What if we crossed a

into a time years after Earth sent a

rescue mission.

WEST

You're not serious? Time travel is

impossible.

WILL

No it's not. It's just improbable.

Like hyperdrive was a hundred years

ago. Nothing's really impossible.

JOHN

This world could be riddled with

doorways to the future.

WILL

So if we walk into that forest

outside, we're really just walking

into this crater years from now.

MAUREEN

Geological plates from different

times wouldn't fit together. That

would explain the tectonic mismatch.

But doorways in time, John?

JOHN

If these portals are opening and

closing, part of some cascading,

natural phenomenon, they could be

tearing this planet apart

WILL

These portals are exactly what I

predicted my time machine would do.

What if the doorways aren't natural?

A machine that bends space, like our

hyperdrive, could be modified to bend

time as well. What if someone on this

world has built a device?

JOHN

Son, I appreciate your input but now

isn't the time for flights of fancy.

WILL

You never listen to me. Not ever.

JOHN

There's no telling how long before

this planet breaks up entirely.

(rising).

Don and I are going to locate the

radioactive material for the core.

Get the ship ready to go. We may have

very little time.

JOHN

Aren't you coming out to say goodbye?

WILL

You're always leaving. What if...

WILL

What if one time you don't come

home...

JOHN

Whenever your grandfather went away

on a mission, held leave these with

me. For safe keeping. And when he got

home I d always be waiting to give

them back.

JOHN

I'm coming back Will. I promise.

WEST

I've got a fix on the radioactive

material. It's through the portal.

JOHN

We'll just have to hope the doorways

remain stable.

JUDY

These crater walls are disabling the

com-links. You won't be able to

communicate with the ship.

Maureen

Come home to me, Professor.

JOHN

I love you, wife.

JUDY

I'm going to regret saying this, But

try to get back in one piece.

WEST

This is kind of a kiss for luck

occasion, wouldn't you agree, Doc?

JUDY

See. I'm regretting it already.

(coy)

Kisses have to be earned. Say

goodbye, Blip.

BLIP

Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

JOHN

You take care of her, Penny.

(kisses her head)

Take care of you too, baby.

SMITH

Yes, enjoy your moments of trite

familial bonding.

SMITH

Because they will be your last.

PENNY

That's everything even close to

nonessential. Even my bellybutton

ring.

WILL

Thanks, Pen.

PENNY

You want to come on a land survey?

PENNY

Look, what does dad know? Maybe

someone did build a time machine.

ROBOT

Robot is on line.

WILL

It sounds like old morse code.

WILL

(sounding out the code)

Danger.

WILL

You said someone is in danger.

SMITH

We all are. You are wise to arm

yourself.

WILL

This gun is set to fire for me only

so don't try anything funny.

SMITH

William, you misjudge me. I only want

to help you.

WILL

Help us? You tried to kill us all.

SMITH

But now our fates are intertwined. if

your father and that idiot West fail,

I will have no chance of getting

home. It is in my best interests they

succeed. And I always follow my best

interests.

SMITH

What monsters roam these alien wilds?

Fools. To set off blindly across this

savage land. Much as I hate to admit

it, it will be harder to manage

without them.

WILL

What are you talking about? They'll

be back. They'll be okay.

WILL

Someone should go after them.

SMITH

Will, I forbid it. You're a boy. A

clever one, certainly, but a child

nonetheless. This planet is likely

full of predators. Even if you found

them, what if they're hurt, ravaged,

dying, what good could you do?

WILL

But you're a doctor.

JUDY

It's impossible.

MAUREEN

Not really. Geologists have

speculated that Dimondium might be

naturally occurring in many older

worlds. Part of a biosphere's way of

rejuvenating itself.

JUDY

This one is ten times more powerful

then that on Alpha Prime. There's

enough here to save Earth.

PENNY

After much deliberation, the Space

Captive has decided to accept her new

role as member of the crew. The

Robinsons, after all, can  obviously

use her help...

PENNY

(flaring)

Now look what you've done. Stop

hanging all over me.

PENNY

Blip. Wait. I'm sorry. Damn.

WILL

I've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon.

WILL

Wow, that's Mom's favorite color.

SMITH

How droll.

SMITH

Run, child, run.

SMITH

Will? Will?

WILL

Wow!

SMITH

William, wait!

WILL

See, over here I'm in the future.

Here I'm in the past. Don't worry.

If my theories are correct, these

doorways should remain stable, for

a while anyway.

SMITH

I can barely contain my glee. Why

aren't you aging like the plants?

WILL

That's just an effect of the portals

forming. Once they stabilize you can

cross from one time to another

just like stepping between two

rooms.

(off his tracker)

Dad's signal is this way. Come on,

Doctor Smith.

WILL (OVER)

What did you find?

SMITH

Come, come, son, no time for

distractions. Let's move on.

JOHN

Damn.

WEST

Damn? Damn is not good.

JOHN

The radiation signature we've been

tracking. it's a  ghost. A

reflection from the Jupiter Two

bouncing off the ore in these walls.

There's no core material here.

JOHN

The ship's back that way. we have to

go through.

PENNY

Blip? I'm sorry. Blip?

PENNY

Blip, wait.

PENNY

Blip, you can't run off like that.

What the-?

PENNY (OVER)

Some kind of fight, in space. It

almost looks like the probe ship

Major West blew up.

PENNY

That could be the Jupiter Two crash

landing.

PENNY

Blip, no!

GIANT BLIP

Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

JOHN

We should be able to see the ship.

WEST

Could these be from the probe?

JOHN

Corroded. This metal is decades old.

WEST

It's not possible.

WEST

What kind of nightmare is this?

Where the hell are we?

JOHN

No, Major, when the hell are we?

WILL

I feel like we got turned around.

SMITH

Just follow your father's signal,

young William.

WILL

Oh shit.

SMITH

A boy of your intelligence shouldn't

swear.

WILL

(pointing)

Look.

SMITH

Oh. Shit, indeed.

CUT TO:

VOICE (OVER)

Well, well. All things really do

come to he who waits.

JOHN

What is this place?

FIGURE

Why Professor, the shock must have

scrambled your brain. Look around

you. Don't you recognize the spot?

You've come home.

JOHN

This can't be...

JOHN

What have you done to the ship.

...Where's my family?

FIGURE

Your family is dead. Dead and in the

ground.

JOHN

No!

FIGURE

What fickle consort in memory. Time

dims certain images while others

shine clear and bright as yesterday.

FIGURE

I'll never forget that morning.

Twenty years ago. What was it you

said? I'll be back. I promise. But I

knew better. You never came home.

FIGURE

Without you, your family never had a

chance. A few spidersv survived the

destruction of the probe ship. They

reached the planet and attacked. I

can still hear the women scream.

JOHN

Who are you?

FIGURE

Don't you recognize me, Dad? It's

me. I'm your son. Will.

JUDY

Penny? Penny?

MAUREEN

Penny? Baby, are you alright?

PENNY

It's okay, Mom. They're not going to

hurt us. it's like  they think I'm

their princess or something.

CUT TO:

JUDY

Best as I can tell this whole clan

was spawned by this single creature.

(to the beast)

We've been a busy girl haven't we?

But...

MAUREEN

Speak, doctor.

JUDY

Each creature seems to have unique

corpuscular patterns on their palms.

As individual an fingerprints, no

two alike. Except...

MAUREEN

Except the prints on this giant

creature and our little Blip

match exactly. Don't they?

JUDY

How did you know?

MAUREEN

Because, I think Blip and our friend

here are actually one and the same.

OLDER WILL

Father, I give you ... eternity.

WIDER

WEST

(coming to)

. . .ouch. Who ordered me that last

drink? What the hell is going on?

JOHN

I think we crossed into our own

future. We've come back to the

Jupiter Two decades after we left.

OLDER WILL

Look father, what my flights of

fancy have wrought. I used your

hypergate to build my time machine.

OLDER WILL

Over the years I have struggled in

vain to harness the awesome power of

time. All my experiments at creating

a stable doorway have been futile.

Until now. Today you will witness my

ultimate triumph.

WEST

The core material. if we could get

that back to our Jupiter Two...

JOHN

The doorways in time that led us

here must be a side effect of his

machine coming on line. Like streams

running into the ocean....

OLDER WILL

Once this core material in fully

introduced into the control console,

I will open a doorway stable enough

for one person to take one trip

through time and space as well.

Today, I will change history.

OLDER WILL

I will return home, to the very day

you took us on this cursed mission.

I'll stop us from taking off. I'll

do what you never could. I'll save

the family. I'll save us all.

JOHN

Look around. Your machine is ripping           this planet

wave you ride home has the same

effect on Earth? What if, in getting

home, you destroy Earth in the

process?

OLDER WILL

I'm going home. I'm going to save

the family.

JOHN

Will, I'm your father. You've got to

listen to me-.

OLDER WILL

Let me tell you about my father. My

father was a walking ghost. Never

there when I needed him. He dragged

his family into deep dark space and

lost them there. My father is not

coming to the rescue.

WILL

We've got to go inside.

SMITH

Slow down, now. We can't know what

waits inside that ravaged craft. But

we can be confidant it is nothing

good. And I for one am frightened.

WILL

But Dad's in there.

SMITH

Will, listen to me. I have crossed

this world with you, found your

father as promised. But I can't let

you go in there unarmed.

WILL

But I've got a gun.

SMITH

If we go forward, the barer of that

weapon must be ready to kill. Murder

is a skill, one which I have

developed and, luckily dear boy, you

have not. Look inside your heart,

Will. Are you truly capable of

taking a life? If not, then I ask

you now, put your faith in me. Give

me your trust. Give me that gun.

WILL

Enable gun for all users.

GUN

Voiceprint confirmed.

SMITH

Finally.

SMITH

A brief lesson in survival on this

world or any other. Never trust

anyone. Remember it into your old

age, should you have one.

(shoving him forward)

Now move!

JOHN

We can go back across the portals to

the past, to the functioning Jupiter

Two, where your mother and sisters

are still alive. We can use this

core material to escape together.

OLDER WILL

And then what? All of us lost in

space. Don't you see? I can do what

you never could. I can save us all.

SMITH (OVER)

I'm afraid not.

Through the doorway comes young

Will, Smith walking behind him, hand

on his shoulder, gun to his head.

SMITH

Never fear. Smith is here.

JOHN

Will, I. . .

SMITH

Don't move, Professor Robinson or

this rather peculiar family reunion

will be tragically brief.

(off Don)

I'll ask you to step away from that

console, Major.

SMITH

Well, well, some of us just don't

know when to stay dead.

SMITH

I borrowed this from the probe ship

in hopes of taking over the helm

once we were in flight. But I seem

to have found a better use instead.

SMITH

Let's try this dance again. You are

the puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do

get it right this time.

SMITH

Robot, enable electric disrupters.

SMITH

Now that's a good gargantuan.

SMITH

Say goodbye to your past. You're

future lies with me. I'm going home

in your place.

WILL

You did it. Just like I imagined.

Re-routed the hypercore. But the

natural power source, the delivery

system. I never thought of those.

OLDER WILL

You will. The future is never what

it looks like when you're ten.

SMITH

Heartwarming. Nauseatingly

sentimental but heartwarming.

SMITH

We certainly could have aged better,

I must say Now, show me how your

little time machine works.

SMITH

An odd moment for mirth, don't you

think? What are you grinning at?

OLDER WILL

Look around you, Doctor. At this

hostile world. Do you really think a

boy could have survived all alone?

VOICE (OVER)

Never fear, Smith is here.

SPIDER SMITH

Hello, Doctor, how nice to see me

again after all these years.

SPIDER SMITH

The spider's sting had some

unexpected side effects.

SPIDER SMITH

But my unique gifts gave me an

advantage in this quarrelsome world.

SPIDER SMITH

After the women were savaged, I

became the father Will never had.

SPIDER SMITH

(bending him)

But you, Doctor. Your crude ambition

fills me with self-loathing.

(twisting him)

You see I have looked within me and

what I see is you.

SPIDER SMITH

I never liked me, anyway.

SPIDER SMITH

Kill them all.

OLDER WILL

No.

SPIDER SMITH

But my dear boy, once the doorway in

time stabilizes, this planet is

going to come apart at the seams.

SPIDER SMITH

I am willing to perish here on this

world for the sake of your most

noble mission. But your selfish

father will only try to stop you.

SPIDER SMITH

Once your mission is complete, none

of this will have happened anyway.

So why not just dispose of them?

SPIDER SMITH

Very well. Robot, take them inside

the ship and keep them there. If

they move, then kill them.

MAUREEN

We've got to get to the ship. Penny?

MAUREEN

Where is she, girl?

SPIDER SMITH

Well, it would seem the time is upon

us. Off we go, William.

JOHN

(shouting)

Will, it's a trick. Smith's carrying

an egg sack. If he's willing to stay

on this world and die, why is he

about to spawn? He's going through

the portal himself.

ROBOT

Proceed to the ship or be destroyed.

SPIDER SMITH

Hurry, boy. Time waits for no man.

SPIDER SMITH

It's almost time. I really am a

word-smith.

OLDER WILL

Once the core cylinder is fully

injected, the planet will begin to

come apart and the time doorway will

stabilize. Then I jump in.

SPIDER SMITH

A leap of faith. How fitting.

OLDER WILL

Tell me again, old monster, how did

the girls die?

SPIDER SMITH

We've been over this before, son.

The spiders attacked the ship

OLDER WILL

In all the years since, the spiders

have never re-surfaced. Why?

SPIDER SMITH

Let's forget the past.

SPIDER SMITH

What are you doing?

OLDER WILL

Focusing the aperture. Remember, the

energy around the portal will rip a

man to pieces.

SPIDER SMITH

Isn't the doorway too small?

OLDER WILL

Not for me.

(a beat)

But then I'm not going, am I? The

spiders didn't kill the girls. It

was you. I just never let myself see

it. You kept me alive because you

needed me. Because I could build

this for you. You killed my family.

Destroyed this world. And I helped.

You became mad as the spiders.

...And I became you.

SPIDER SMITH

Poor, poor boy. Did you really think

I would let you go home? Let all

that I have become vanish? Look at

me. I am no mere man. I am a God.

SPIDER SMITH

Your father was right. Within me

roil the growing needs of a master

race. We WILL descend upon helpless

Earth. An entire planet to rule.

SPIDER SMITH

An entire planet on which to feed.

WEST

I'll run, draw his fire. You may

have time to get away with Will.

ROBOT (OVER)

Halt or Robot will destroy.

WILL

Do you remember what I taught you. A

long time ago. About friendship?

ROBOT

Friendship means acting with your

heart not your head.

WILL

That's why I rebuilt you. Because I

wanted us to be friends.

ROBOT

Logic error. Friendship does not

compute.

WILL

Forget logic. Act with your heart.

ROBOT

Robot has no heart. Robot is powered

by a fusion pulse generator

WILL

Every living thing has a heart.

ROBOT

Any attempts to override command

protocols may result in fused

processors in my neural net.

WILL

Please, Robot, if you don't let us

go, we're all going to die. I'm

asking you now, will you help us?

Will you be my friend?

ROBOT

Robot attempting to deactivate

control bolt-commands

overriddenattempting to

reroute-dangercircuitry

overloadattempting to escape-kill

them, kill them...

WILL

You did it.

ROBOT

Robot will save ... I will save Will

Robinson. I will save my friend.

MAUREEN

(shouting )

Penny? Penny?

MAUREEN

Where did you go?

PENNY

I came through the forest. I had a

promise I had to keep.

JUDY

Inside. Fast.

JOHN

You've got find your way back to the

ship. The portals may still be

stable. I'll try to meet you there.

WEST

What do you mean?

JOHN

I'm going to get that core material.

It's our only chance to escape.

WEST

I'll stay. The family needs their

father

JOHN

The crew needs their pilot. No

matter what happens, when the planet

starts to break up you take off.

WEST

Without the core we'll never have

enough power to make orbit.

JOHN

You've got to try. Promise me, Don.

WEST

Good luck. Commander.

JOHN

Will. Son. I want you to know-

WILL

(fighting tears)

You'll tell me when you get back to

the ship. Now there just isn't time.

JOHN

I could use a weapon.

ROBOT

Professor, I have a plan.

SPIDER SMITH

Time to die, son.

OLDER WILL

I'm not your son.

SPIDER SMITH

Goodbye.

WILL

Look.

WEST

(disappointed)

Damn. He's still breathing.

WILL

The time machine must be near full

power. The portals are collapsing.

WEST

Which one leads us home?

WILL

There.

WILL

We can't just leave him here.

WEST

Sure we can.

(off WILL's stare)

Damn it.

(slapping the Doctor)

Smith. Wake up. Smith.

SMITH

(coming to)

Oh, the pain, the pain.

ROBOT

Danger. Will Robinson. Danger.

WEST

Jump!

PENNY

Mom, the forest.

MAUREEN

Where's John?

WEST

The portal closed behind us. It was

his only way back.

WEST

We've got to try and lift off.

MAUREEN

We've already begun the pre-flight

countdown. You have the Com.

(off Don's expression)

I'm going to save as many lives as I

can, Major. Now strap in.

JOHN (OVER)

Not so fast.

JOHN

You sabotaged our mission.

(hook)

You killed my family

(jab)

You stole my son. It's payback time.

SPIDER SMITH

Spare me the fury of the righteous.

SPIDER SMITH

I think there's time for a snack

before my trip.

SPIDER SMITH

(sarcastic)

Oh, the pain. The pain.

JOHN

You ain't seen nothing yet.

JOHN

Remember the probe ship? These

monsters eat their wounded.

SPIDER SMITH

No. Stop. No!

JOHN

Take all the time you want to die.

MAUREEN

I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

MAUREEN

Let's go, Major.

MAUREEN

(quiet)

Goodbye, my love.

WEST

Engaging primary thrusters. Now!

JOHN

Come on, son. Wake up.

OLDER WILL

Dad?

JOHN

I thought I lost you.

OLDER WILL

The core.

OLDER WILL

You could have taken the core and

left before it was too late. You

saved me instead.

JOHN

There wasn't any choice. I couldn't

let you fall.You're my boy.

OLDER WILL

Look. They made it.

WEST

We're not getting any altitude.

JUDY

I'm reading a power build up.

Markers in the red-

PENNY

She's dead.

WEST

Not enough power to make orbit.

WEST

(to Maureen)

I'm sorry.

JOHN

I couldn't save them.

OLDER WILL (OVER)

So many years ago and I can still

feel it. Our sun. Our Earth. It's

all I've thought about. Going home.

OLDER WILL

A long time ago, you told a small

boy that one day he'd understand how

precious he was, how much his father

loved him. Today is that day.

OLDER WILL

All I could see was your need to go

forward at any cost. What you never

showed me was your love. I lost

that. Robbed by time. I could never

see how much you cared. Until now.

OLDER WILL

Father, take my hand.

MAUREEN

I kept hoping somehow he'd appear.

MAUREEN

Let's go, Major.

MAUREEN

(quiet)

Goodbye my love.

PENNY

Look.

OLDER WILL

DON'T make me wait another lifetime

to know how you feel.

JOHN

Come with us.

OLDER WILL

I can't. There was only enough power

for one person, one trip, remember?

MAUREEN

Will?

OLDER WILL

It's good to see you again, Mom.

It's good to see you alive.

(fading)

Sorry about all the monkey business.

JOHN

He sacrificed everything for his

family.

MAUREEN

(fighting tears)

He had a good example.

WILL

Dad?

WILL

I'm glad you came back.

JOHN

I just want you to know I love you

son. I love you very much.

WEST (OVER)

The planet is breaking up around us.

WEST

Nice of you to drop in.

JOHN

Status?

SMITH

We're doomed. We're doomed.

WEST

Boy, that felt good.

JOHN

Get us airborne.

WEST

I'm going to try to reach escape

velocity. Maybe we can break the

gravitational pull.

JOHN

No. We don't have the core material.

The gravity wells will drag us down.

WEST

We might-

JOHN

We won't make it. Trust me. I know.

We've got to go down.

WEST

What?

JOHN

Through the planet as she breaks up.

WEST

That's insane.

JOHN

I don't have time to argue. I'm

giving you a direct order, Major.

WEST

Yes Sir.

JOHN

There.

WEST

I see it.

JUDY

Nice work, flyboy.

WEST

So, I earn that kiss yet?

JUDY

(a peck on the cheek)

You earned that.

JUDY

This one is on credit.

JUDY

Cold fish, huh?

MAUREEN

Poor thing. She's lost her whole

family.

(off Penny)

Penny, why are you looking at me

like that. Penny?

PENNY

I promised Judy I'd take care of

her. I couldn't leave her all alone.

Well I am their princess, after all.

(turning)

You can come out mow.

JOHN

Dimondium. Now if we could only find

our way back to Earth.

ROBOT

If I may, Professor.

ROBOT

Your son's star charts.

WILL

It's a map home.

WEST

The planet's gravity field in

collapsing.

MAUREEN

We'll be sucked in.

JOHN

There's no way to get clear in time.

JUDY

The hyperdrive.

MAUREEN

Everybody hang on.

PENNY

Here we go again.

WILL

Cool.
