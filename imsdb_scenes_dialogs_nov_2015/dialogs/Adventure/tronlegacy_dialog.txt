TRON LEGACY

Written by

Richard Jefferies

1   INT.   CYBERSPACE

Electric-neon netherworld.     Pulsing chromatics over jet black.

CONSTRUCTION CREW toils to complete a vast SWITCHING NEXUS.

CYPER-TECH CREWMEN and MACHINERY branded "X-NET".

3D lattice of routers, refractors, reassemblers... New,

unused data OPTIK HIGHWAY routes radiate from all sides,

crossing cyberspace.

X-Net Tactical Corps troops (herein X-Takks) patrol every

inch.

2   INT.   X-NET NEXUS - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

DATA "TRAIN" enters. Sliver of RED DATA ENERGY shunt off,

shooting into RANDOM MEMORY BUFFER - geometrically perfect

lattice of PLASMA BEAMS and WHITE HOT intersection points.

X-Takks notice, moving to investigate.

DEEP IN THE LATTICE:

Red data "uploads" into solid form. A RED FIGURE. We see

from the back - infrared strobing DISK, etched metallic

detail, lethal EDGES -

Then slowly he - IT - turns.     Hardly a face, only data-hungry

eyes, riveted to a TASK -

TRON 2.0.

Seriously upgraded, over-clocked, armed for trouble. The

friendly hero we once knew has been re-programmed into a

ruthless cyber-ninja.

X-Takks search ten story gantries.

TRON springs into the lattice, dodging PLASMA BEAMS, avoiding

detection. Slips into:

3   INT.   NEXUS MAIN SHAFT

X-Takks on high alert.

TRON slips down main shaft, freezes, confirms data.       Darts

behind MAIN POWER SUPPLY.

Pulls his DISK.     DISK opens, extends oscillating DATA KEY.

(CONTINUED)

3   CONTINUED:

TRON inserts key in and ENCRYPTION PANEL.     Circuits energize.

Shockwave quakes system.

POWER SUPPLY OVERLOADS, SHORTING OUT.

X-Takks spot TRON.

X-TAKKS

Intruder!   Fix coordinates!

POLICE POUNCE, FIRING.

Tron pulls hyper-disk off his back and HURLS IT -

DISK strikes cop, fries his circuits. Disk ricochets,

brutally accurate, takes out three more Police -

TRON flips into the air - His DISK boomerangs straight for

him. Certain death. But his timing is inhumanly accurate.

DISK docks on his back midair, lands and bolts.

ALARMS WAIL -

POWER SUPPLY VERGES on MELTDOWN, CIRCUITS FRY, PLASMA SPEWS.

X-NET CRISIS TEAM rushes in, inserts MASTER KEY. POWER SUPPLY

STABILIZES. Catastrophe averted.

TRON flips away, chased by firing X-Takks -

Arriving on the scene - split-second response:

Elite team of X-NET SECURITY AGENTS, lead by:

RX23 SECURITY LEADER (Cyber-twin of our real-world hero RUSH).

TRON jumps down MAIN SHAFT - a thousand stories. Riding his

DISK as a heat shield dodges X-Net fire, swerves into a DATA

CHANNEL -

RX23 and a pair of his AGENTS hop on PULSE RIDER vehicles,

hotly pursuing TRON.

TRON PLUNGES onto a DATA HIGHWAY - speed out of NEXUS, hurls

across cyberspace.

AGENT 1

This is the first time an Intruder

has broken into X-Net!

RX23 LEADER

And it's the last. Follow him!

Shut him down!

They speed onto the OPTIK HIGHWAY.

4   INT.   X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY

Broadband, light-speed OPTIK HIGHWAY.     Empty, except for:

TRON - accelerating, escaping.

Rx23 and AGENTS catch up fast on Pulse Rider Vehicles.

TRON throws his disk. Blings off Agents - triggers CRASH.

PLASMA BLAST rips open highway wall.

Rx23 emerges unscathed, pursuing.

5   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE

TRON leaps out blast hole, recovers his disk, vanishes into

ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE.

Rx23 roars after him, riding hard, joined by:

Airborne SEARCH ENGINE vehicle, piloted by a dumpy nerd

program called KROD.

KROD

I got a lock. Coordinate 32937!

RX23

I'm on him!

RX23 chases Tron into a dark canyon. Hairpin turns and blind

curves. RX23 arrives a junction. Tron has vanished.

RX23

Which way did he go?!

6   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION BETA TEST LAB - DAY

Rabbit warren of computer programmers in crisis mode.

A head shoots up from a cubicle. It's Rush Nortebi, 23,

computer security expert. Real world version of the RX23

program. His cubicle is jammed with racks of vintage and

bleeding-edge computer gear.

RUSH

I said WHICH WAY DID HE GO?

Dozens of programmers work feverishly to track the system

intruder. Everybody's stumped. Dangling from desk lamps,

the company toy: Conical pyramid with a square stuck on top,

labeled "X-NET RULES!"

RUSH

Come on guys! Nobody hacks X-Net.

You gonna let him get away?!

MILES

Rush, I think I found him!

In the adjacent cubicle: Overweight ultra-nerd MILES RABBISH -

real world version of cyberworld Krod.

MILES

Check the old game grid!

Rush jockeys an old Apple LISA computer.     On screen: a crude

old vector graphics game grid.

A RED FIGURE steps appears the grid.

RUSH

You get a cookie, Miles!

Programmers gather to watch Rush in action.

7   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - THE OLD GAME GRID

Vast, low-rez, uncool, largely forgotten.

TRON pulls a LIGHT WAND from his legging, grips it. A TURBO-

CHARGED LIGHT-CYCLE rezzes up beneath him. He fires his

LIGHTCYCLE. ZIP, he's gone.

Onto the grid blasts RX23, speeding on his Pulse rider.    He

skids and swerves, learning the funky surface.

Search Engine flies onto the scene, hovering overhead.

KROD

Coordinate 6532.02!   There he goes!

The chase is on.

TRON escapes across the vast grid-plane, head down, eyes

hollow. He gains speed, retreating to somewhere...

RX23 surges on his Pulse Rider, closing the gap.

PR VP

Weather is holding. Dress rehearsal

on for 6PM. In the morning, we let

the press in for a 7AM tech set-up,

then you go live worldwide 9 AM sharp.

SINCLAIR

Delay the press until 8:30. I'll

taking the stage at 8:50. Force a

network break-in. Then it's news.

SINCLAIR

Play that again.

VIDEO PLAYBACK

X-Net deploys radical software design,

constructs proprietary white-hot

firewalls, unleashes virus killer

apps. Creating the most secure data

network in history. Your data can

never again be hacked, corrupted,

stolen or destroyed. X-Net is the

final solution, totally guaranteed

99.999% secure data transmission -

SINCLAIR

Who changed that? Who put "99.999"?

PR VP

Um, that would be...    Legal.

SINCLAIR

Change it back to the way I wrote

it. With the launch of X-Net, this

company guarantees one hundred percent

secure data transmission. If we

can't deliver on that promise, we

deserve to be out of business.

SINCLAIR

What can't wait, Rush?

What's she doing here?    This is an

operations meeting.

KELTER

You and Meg still, eh...    At it?

RUSH

There was never anything between us.

RUSH

She's Advanced Projects.    This has

nothing to do with her.

SINCLAIR

This company's existence depends on

the flawless launch of X-Net in twenty-

two hours, fifty-one minutes. Now

somebody - some hacker, some

competitor, somebody - just proved

they're smarter than us. Breaking

into X-Net is theoretically

impossible.

RUSH

This creep's the best I've ever seen.

He crosses platforms, cracks 128 bit

encryption, cloaks every move, never

leaves a trace.

SINCLAIR

When you find him, I'll be sure to

hire him.

11

23   CONTINUED:    (2)

SINCLAIR

Boys and girls, we cannot sell a

secure network that is not secure.

PR VP

We delay the launch.

SINCLAIR

And the world assumes we've got a

faulty product. And they'd be right.

KELTER

We ramp up our encryption schemes -

PHLEGMAN

Thicken all firewalls -

RUSH

We can't win playing defense. And

it's a bigger job than just swatting

an intruder program. Somewhere,

there's a human mind behind this

thing. We have to get to that User

and shut him - or her - down, or the

game never ends.

SINCLAIR

What do you need, Rush?

RUSH

20 guys for 20 days -

SINCLAIR

We don't have 20 hours. This problem

needs to be gone before tomorrow

9AM. Come on people, this company's

future is at stake! It's time to

think without a box!

RUDY

At a time like this, let's seek

inspiration in the past. We should

ask ourselves: What solution would

spring from the inspired mind of our

departed leader, Flynn.

MEG

Um...   Midway into phase one testing.

SINCLAIR

If we can't fight this intruder from

the outside, then maybe we need to

fight him from the inside.

MEG

I'm ready to do my part.

SINCLAIR

This company needs a hero. Who among

you is the smartest, most resourceful

and courageous?

MEG

Who else could it be?

SINCLAIR

Rush, you're the only one I can trust

to eliminate the intruder. But you

won't be doing it the way you thought.

Meg's been working on something down

here that's, well... Beyond Top

Secret.

26   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER

MEG

This is where Flynn worked.   And

where he died.

SINCLAIR

Meg has reconstructed Flynn's last

project. This time it works.

RUSH

You didn't pick this up at Circuit

City. What is it?

MEG

A Quantum Digitizer. Prototype,

only one of its kind. Flynn designed

it to break down physical objects

into high resolution data. Luckily,

we salvaged his key components and

back-engineered the system.

RUSH

That's...   Not possible.

(CONTINUED)

14

26   CONTINUED:

MEG

Flynn was trying to take it one step

further. He wanted to transport a

human being into cyberspace.

RUSH

You mean the urban legends? A

computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace

a long time ago.

SINCLAIR

We think it happened.

SINCLAIR

It was a fluke. But Flynn worked

for years, down here, trying to make

it happen again. One day a test

went bad. A plasma reaction destroyed

this lab. Flynn was reduced to ash.

RUSH

I was never told how he died. It

was all just weird, you know, because

Flynn's the guy who hired me. But

he was strange, kept to himself, I

didn't know what job I was supposed

to be doing.

(to Sinclair)

Then you came onboard, the company

woke up, we had a direction. It was

kind of pathetic, because by the

time Flynn died, everybody was too

busy to care.

SINCLAIR

He was brilliant in his way, but

genius without discipline leads to

nothing. His reckless habits nearly

ruined this company... And for sure

got him killed.

MEG

That kind of accident can't happen

again. We've upgraded the system in

ways Flynn never could. The chips

didn't exist until now.

MEG

Hey, Jo-Jo.    Have good trip?

RUSH

You want her to send me into

cyberspace to catch that jerk who

hacked us?

SINCLAIR

The future of this company depends

on it.

RUSH

You can bring me back okay?

MEG

Ask Jo-Jo.

SINCLAIR

Destroy the intruder by 9AM tomorrow,

Rush. I know if anyone can, it's

you. I've had my eye on you for a

long time. Score this hit and I'll

make you my full partner in this

company.

RUSH

I won't let you down.   Let's do it.

MEG

I promise I'll get you back safely

by 9AM tomorrow. But you have to

promise me something too -

(CONTINUED)

16

26   CONTINUED:    (3)

RUSH

You're a piece of work. You dumped

me because you said I was too much

about the company's needs and not

enough about yours. Well here we

are, the company needs their best

guy, and you just can't admit how

much to hurts to nominate me.

MEG

This bigger than us, Rush. Listen

to me. I don't know what you're

going to find in there, but whatever

it is, promise you'll follow your

heart and do the right thing.

RUSH

Oh.    So you think I have a heart?

know the program they used to call

Tron?

PLEXOR

You are in error. Zero match.

RUSH

Exactly. That's how he's getting

past you. You don't see him for

what he is. He's one of your own,

gone bad. Tron was a crude security

program from Encom's old days.

Strictly low-rez, right? Archived

and forgotten. But his source code

contains all the architecture of

every Encom system, including X-net.

People who write all of your

instructions.

He displays random instability.

PLEXOR

Users do not exist.

RUSH

How do we contact Sinclair?    He'll

explain.

PLEXOR

Define "Sinclair".

RUSH

You don't know? Oh geez. There

must be a way to link him into this.

MEGA

Zero match for a "Sinclair".

RUSH

He's your boss. Everybody's boss.

Outside, in the real world.

Okay. Sorry. I'm a program, guess

I got a piece of my code corrupted.

Whatever it is, it's given me power

over Tron.

(to X-Takks and Mega)

They saw me read his circuits. Can

any other program do that?

MEGA

He creates alternative data channels

at will.

PLEXOR

Chaos.

RUSH

Yeah, I'm a little unstable.    But I

can find Tron for you.

He's a specialist in pattern

recognition. He snagged the last

known position on Tron for me.

MEGA

This is a waste of X-Net resources.

You're strictly random. We will

never find the intruder this way.

RUSH

Plexor ordered us to work together.

You can't doubt his instructions,

right?

MEGA

Of course not. But I am programmed

to predict all possible errors. You

contain an infinite quantity.

RUSH

Meg for sure programmed you.

MEGA

I have no data on "Meg".

RUSH

Never mind.    I'm being random.

RUSH

X-Net is amazing. It's going to

change everything. Unless one rogue

program called Tron brings it down.

Do you believe he could?

I calculated the probability.

We'll make sure he needs to. Go set

up the trap.

You only get one shot at this, big

guy. Stop him but don't destroy

him, right? He's got data I need.

MEGA

If this is Tron's territory, he'll

know we're here. He'll hide.

He can't resist a grudge match.

He'll take risks trying to beat me.

X-Net Drone Workers assemble beams, girders, circuitry.

101   CONTINUED:

X-Net OPTIK HIGHWAY NETWORK blasts through old systems and

extends across cyberspace with alarming speed.

PLEXOR

Is completion on schedule?

X-NET BUILDER BOSS

On schedule.

Plexor boards his Cruiser, which SPEEDS onto a completed

stretch of X-Net OPTIK HIGHWAY. He's the only vehicle in

sight, hogging a thousand brand-new lanes of data expressway.

Plexor accelerates, relishing the thrill of unchecked power -

102   EXT.   X-NET ARTERIES - VARIOUS

Plexor's Cruiser speeds through a new, as-yet unused X-Net

switching station. It's heavily secured. X-Takk troops

defer to their supreme leader.

Plexor veers onto a proprietary side-route, bound for:

103   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER

Firewall apertures cool, anticipating Plexor's arrival.

Encryption portal opens.

Plexor's Cruiser glides in.

Portal closes.

Firewalls reactivate, blazing red-hot, sealing the fortress.

104   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER

Towering corridors. Powerful armored X-Takk Guards stand in

pairs at every portal, corner and column.

Plexor strides past, steps into a special GATE. Data beams

react with his circuitry. Encryption key resolves.

Gate opens.

105   INT.   PROGRAMMING CHAMBER

Plexor strides across the spare, sleek space.

On a slab lies Mega, radiated from above by READER BEAMS.

78

105   CONTINUED:

Plexor considers her glowing body circuits.          Studies emerging

data patterns.

Satisfied, he halts the process.        Beams go dark.

PLEXOR

Boot up.

Mega awakens, sits up.      She sees the device, then Plexor.

MEGA

You treat me like I've been corrupted.

PLEXOR

I cannot predict the random effects

Flynn might have caused in you.

MEGA

You programmed me to gather

intelligence. That's all I've ever

done.

PLEXOR

How long have you known Flynn?

MEGA

Enough time to gain his trust.

PLEXOR

Your behavior was highly authentic.

MEGA

To him.    It had to be.

PLEXOR

Have you allowed Flynn to complete a

full interface with you?

MEGA

I am programmed to allow such access

only to you, Plexor.

Her eyes lock on him.      He is satisfied.

PLEXOR

Flynn claims to be a User.     As did

the one called Rush.

MEGA

Users do not exist.

PLEXOR

You have seen nothing to make you

doubt this?

79

105   CONTINUED:    (2)

MEGA

Nothing.

PLEXOR

They possess no powers beyond those

of routine Programs?

MEGA

I have no knowledge of such powers.

She steps down.     They walk out of the chamber.

PLEXOR

Still, there is something about them

I cannot compute. Flynn plans to

attack me, doesn't he?

MEGA

Yes. And Rush will fight by his

side.

PLEXOR

Where will they strike?

MEGA

Flynn does not decide until the hour

of his attack. But he trusts me

completely. When he knows the place,

I will know it as well.

PLEXOR

Perfect. They will be met with a

final thrashing. Yes, let them come.

They pass through the gate, arrive in the corridor.

MEGA

Have you further instructions for

me?

PLEXOR

None for now. But stay close.

They lock gazes.     Barcode data surges between them.

PLEXOR

You came to me full of glitches and

random routines. Look at you now.

What an extraordinary piece of

programming I have made of you. I

created X-Net to the same standard

of flawless beauty. Soon, its

perfection will become all that is,

and all that ever will be.

MEGA

All events remain under your control.

With a smirk and a final jolt of data, Plexor leaves her.

106   INT.   PLEXOR'S CPU

Plexor crosses into his inner sanctum. Raises his disk,

initiates RUBY BEAM link with Sinclair.

Mega appears on a balcony above, in the shadows, secretly

observing Plexor.

107   EXT.   DARK ZONE

Howling, barren, dim.      Circuitry left unpowered for eons.

Rush and Krod follow Flynn and Fighters, into treacherous

canyons, across vast planes.

Rush hears something and pulls the group behind cover.

RUSH

Over there!

Three massive X-NET X-PORTER VEHICLES rumble by. Imprisoned

in the rear are hundreds of Programs. Cruisers blast a path

through mountains and speed away.

KROD

Those Programs think they're just

being transferred!

RUSH

Can we take out those X-Net guys?

FLYNN

Our forces are too thin. We can't

risk a battle that would reveal this

position.

From another direction appear two Code Monkey Programs.

CODE MONK B3T

Flynn!   Down here!

FLYNN

BT!    JR!

CODE MONK J2R

Flynn!   Enter. We configured a base.

(CONTINUED)

81

107   CONTINUED:

FLYNN

Good to see you guys. When did the

X-Net goons start patrolling all the

way out here?

CODE MONK B3T

They're everywhere now. Taking all

Programs by force.

CODE MONK J2R

Come.   There is much to report!

They head down into:

108   INT.   LAST FIGHTER CACHE

Deteriorating silicon lattice.     Flynn, Rush, Krod and Fighters

arrive to a meager encampment.

CODE MONK N1J

Greetings.

FLYNN

Hey guys. This is Rush and his main

man Krod. They defected from Plexor's

forces to fight with us.

A buzz of hope penetrates gloom.       Nobody has defected from

Plexor before.

CODE MONK N1J

We made progress decoding X-Net's

power supply encryption.

FLYNN

Excellent.   Let's see.

In a make-shift lab, CODE MONKEYS demonstrate, working at

mind-boggling speed, assembling a small intricate HOLOGON

DEVICE (conical pyramid-shaped encryption key).

KROD

I've seen that somewhere.

RUSH

It's the encryption pattern on

Plexor's disk.

FLYNN

Good eyes. We've got Mole Programs

who score chunks of Plexor's personal

code anywhere they can find it.

These guys fit the pieces together.

(MORE)

82

108   CONTINUED:

FLYNN (CONT'D)

It can take a quadrillion

combinations.

CODE MONK J2R

We just snagged the last piece, but

the battle cost us big time.

FLYNN

How many of you crashed?

Heads shake somberly.

FLYNN

The Teraflop Boys?     Algebrat?

CODE MONK J2R

All that survive, you see standing

here.

FLYNN

Oh Geez.

Flynn falters on his bad leg.       Quantz and Boole support him.

FLYNN

Time is running out!

Rush approaches Code monkeys as they toil blur-speed, trying

to fit the final code piece - a flat square. Pyramidal

HOLOGON looks exactly like the X-Net desk toy we saw in Rush's

cubicle.

KROD

Yow. I get tired just watching these

dudes.

Rush sees:    Compilers try to fit the square inside the

pyramid.

RUSH

Just for laughs, try putting the

circle on top of the pyramid.

CODE MONKS

(unison)

That's incongruous.

RUSH

If I'm wrong, ding me.

FLYNN

What have we got to lose?    Try it.

Code Monkeys place the square on top of the pyramid.

83

108   CONTINUED:    (2)

Bingo.

Square spins into a circle, latches and LIGHTS the entire

Hologon lattice. Intricate 3D code patterns ANIMATES.

FLYNN

Not bad.

KROD

Good thing you didn't terminate us.

RUSH

How do we use this thing to shut

down Plexor?

FLYNN

(picks up hologon)

It's a copy of Plexor's master key.

We can break into any X-Net facility

and fry the power supply.

RUSH

But once Plexor knows we have it,

he'll change the code.

FLYNN

Yep.   We've got one shot.

RUSH

Then we should take out the power

supply to Plexor's main server.

GROUP

Yes! Take out Plexor's central

server!

FLYNN

Hang on, guys, that's not as easy as

it sounds -

RUSH

I was inside the main server, I saw

how it's laid out.

KROD

I used to work there!   I'll recognize

where everything is!

CODE MONK N1J

We can take it!

CODE MONK J2R

Hit Plexor where he lives!

(CONTINUED)

84

108   CONTINUED:    (3)

FLYNN

Even with this key, it won't -

QUANTZ

We can pull it off, can't we Flynn?

One final assault on Plexor's central

server?

BOOLE

Shut him down forever?

All eyes on Flynn.    Rush's naivete has ignited false hope in

the Fighters.

RUSH

Of course we can.

Flynn forces a smile.

FLYNN

Hey, the future depends on us.    How

could we fail?

109   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - MOMENTS LATER

Sinclair comes off the secured elevator, finds Meg and Dewey

at work on Quantum Digitizer.

MEG

It's almost fixed. I'll be able to

bring back Rush soon -

SINCLAIR

Excellent work. Unfortunately, I'm

shutting down this project.

MEG

What?

SINCLAIR

Something came up. The company is

at stake. I can't go into details.

MEG

But Rush would have no way to return!

SINCLAIR

Meg. I will never hold you

responsible. This is a tough call,

but it's mine. Dismantle and destroy

all of this equipment and software.

Immediately.

85

109   CONTINUED:

MEG

Well -

SINCLAIR

Meg...   I'm not asking.

MEG

I understand.

He shoots a look and exits.

110   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY OVER DARK ZONE

Compiler Crews work at megahertz speed. OPTIK HIGHWAYS extend

and converge. Switching stations assemble. Crews shift to

new assignments.

Pull wide to see dismal ground below.    Dark zone, emitting

woeful blips of random energy.

Pillars descend from X-Net crews above and SMASH into the

old silicon, planting themselves deep and impervious.

Rush stands on a vista point, aghast as X-Net construction

dominates the landscape.

FLYNN

It's a bummer being on the losing

team, huh Rush?

Flynn sits nearby, trying to patch his corrupted leg.

RUSH

We'll trash X-Net. Then we'll go

back to the our world and expose

what Sinclair's done.

He looks at Krod, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys in the

distance, preparing for battle.

RUSH

Do they have any idea our world

exists? Do they understand what a

User is?

FLYNN

Programs once connected freely with

their Users. But Plexor shut down

the I/O ports, severing all links.

He controls all contact with the

world we once knew. Programs operate

on his instructions or none at all.

(CONTINUED)

86

110   CONTINUED:

RUSH

Or yours.

FLYNN

It's nothing to brag about.    We're

getting our butts kicked.

RUSH

It there a way to contact Meg? She

can transport us back to our world.

Maybe it's better if we fight Sinclair

on his own turf.

Flynn lays a somber gaze on his eager Fighters.

FLYNN

I gave up the idea of going back a

long time ago... You should too.

RUSH

What do you mean?

FLYNN

Sinclair didn't get where he is by

being dumb. Even if we survive

Plexor's forces in here, Sinclair

will make sure we never get back

home.

RUSH

But...   Meg said -

FLYNN

I'm sure she'll do everything she

can. It might not be enough.

Flynn removes a cover-plate from his leg, trying to hide the

damage from Rush. Suspicious, Rush pulls the plate aside.

RUSH

Oh, man.

Flynn's data corruption has worsened. His leg throbs with

the drab glow of irreversible MEMORY DRAIN.

RUSH

Why didn't you tell anyone it was

this bad?

Flynn looks at his leg.     Then at Rush.

FLYNN

Rush. I think Meg suspects the truth

about Sinclair.

FLYNN (CONT'D)

That's why she sent you here. She

knew you're the one guy who could

find out.

RUSH

I thought she hated me.

FLYNN

She believed in you more than you

believed in yourself.

It sinks in.    Wow.

RUSH

Do we really have a shot at winning

against Plexor?

FLYNN

We have his master key. And we have

Mega working on the inside.

RUSH

Mega... Are you sure about her? I

get the feeling she plays both sides.

FLYNN

Plexor programmed her to perform his

will. He's a control freak. I'm

not. I programmed her to have a

will of her own. Whatever she

decides, it's up to her.

RUSH

Sounds dangerous.

FLYNN

Sometimes you've got to trust the

bigger plan.

Krod and Fighters approach.

CODE MONK J2R

Ready to rock and roll.

FLYNN

Guys... Rush is right about our

final attack. If we've only got one

shot, we should go for Plexor's

central server. If we insert the

hologon key in the main power supply,

we can trigger a meltdown. Plexor

will be have his best troops standing

in our way.

FLYNN (CONT'D)

Getting past them was the ultimate

task I programmed Tron to carry out.

He takes up Tron's dark disk.

FLYNN

I turbo-charged him to burn hot and

burn fast. Who else could handle

the operating code in this disk?

He extends the disk to Rush.

FLYNN

You.

RUSH

Uhhh, I don't think so.

BOOLE

It could mean the difference between

winning and losing.

KROD

Hey, I'll try.

Rush holds off Krod, takes the disk.

RUSH

What do I do - ?

Waves of Rush's DATA ENERGY surge into disk circuitry.

RUSH

Yow!

He buckles and shakes.    Hands zapping.    Knees trembling.

FLYNN

Steady. It's all about giving as

much as you get. Let it become a

part of you.

Rush clenches teeth, concentrates.     Grips the disk.

Energy surges back and forth, up Rush's arms, around the

disk. He holds tight, ready to scream -

KROD

Awesome, dude! Don't let go!

Fighters are amazed, as TRON'S DISK POWERS UP -

And RUSH'S body circuits DAZZLE in the ruby circuitry patterns

of TRON.

(CONTINUED)

110   CONTINUED:    (4)

KROD

HE DID IT!

FLYNN

Damn, look at that...     He did it.

Rush looks at his arms, astounded. His circuitry strobes in

hues of brilliant red. Disk animates and unfolds, revealing

infinite surface variations.

Rush feels new power surging inside his body. His eyes

harden, keen like Tron's. Rush LEAPS BACKWARD, goes airborne,

lands on a ledge high above. Amazing balance.

KROD & FIGHTERS

YES!   Excellent move, dude!

RUSH

It feels...    Awesome.

Rush's voice is a little deeper, with a digital edge.       It

surprises him.

He cocks his disk and THROWS.

Disk rockets across the landscape, a mile away and STRIKES

an X-NET SURVEY POST, blasting it to bits. Disk arcs high,

shoots back toward Rush.

Rush looks worried for a second, ready to duck -

FLYNN

Don't flinch, Rush!   It's your disk

now.

Disk snaps back into Rush's hand, painlessly.       Throbbing

with energy.

RUSH

Oh man, this is good.

Rush pulls a new LIGHT WAND from a thigh bracket. It extends

into a hundred-foot vaulting pole. Rush VAULTS across the

canyon, lands with precision. Light pole retracts into the

wand in a nanosecond.

KROD

Awwwww!   Where can I get one of those?

Another two vaults and a leap - Rush tosses his disk into a

spiral, steps off it mid-air (like stairs), and lands

perfectly - rejoining the group.

Cheers from Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys.       Flynn

shakes Rush's hand - energy surges between them.

111   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER - MAIN HALL

Plexor reviews a line of elite X-Takks. All are decked in

thick battle gear, gripping an array of menacing ultra-tech

weapons.

PLEXOR

Perfect. Any three of you could

crash an army of Flynn's best. But

I've prepare for his random acts by

designing massive redundancy.

Widen to reveal:

BATTALION of X-Takks, lined in precise rows, filling the

vast hall. Since Adolf Hitler, no one has displayed such an

awesome military machine.

112   INT.   PLEXOR'S INNER SANCTUM

Mega sneaks in, alone. She pulls her disk off her back and

raises it above her head. Data energizes around her. She

clenches hard, trying to make the connection.

A RUBY BEAM converges off her disk, reaching skyward.

113   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - NIGHT

Meg and Dewey work to dismantle the lab.

Meg walks past, stops. Comes back.      Reads fresh text on a

X-Net Specialists drops the sides on a cubic cage.

A frozen dog-like CYBAVOR CREATURE stands like a statue.

Plexor nods.    X-Net Specialist activates.

Cybavor comes alive.     Circuits RAGING.    Eyes pulsing.

Plexor summons an X-Net Worker Drone.

PLEXOR

Install yourself over there.

Worker Drone does as he's told.       He freezes in place.

PLEXOR

Attack!

Cybavor leaps like a hyena, bounds the length of the hall.

DIVES at the Worker Drone...

And DEVOURS HIM mercilessly.

Energy sparks fly, circuits zap, as the Cybavor digest the

energy, GROWS LARGER, then SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE (like DNA),

then regrows the missing halves.

Now the Cybavor is a PAIR of nasty, snarling Cybavors.

PLEXOR

End routine.

Cybavors sit.

PLEXOR

Elegant.

Surveying his perfect defenses, he notices one thing missing.

PLEXOR

X-Takks file out in perfect lines, turn perfect corners,

dispersing into the compound. Each one moves in exactly the

same way.

Plexor turns sharply to exit, encountering...      Mega.    Standing

there obediently.

115   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER

On the fortress perimeter, X-Takks stand watch at the base

of a deep security moat.

They turn, eyes scanning. Behind them, a LIGHT POLE extends

into the canyon, then swings across.

It's "tronified" Rush, using his vaulting pole to ferry

Fighters across the moat edges.

He returns to the far side, landing momentarily on a lone

central pinnacle to make the distance.

Rush vaults back to gather Krod, who's the last to cross.

RUSH

Don't take this the wrong way.

KROD

Don't drop me.

He hugs Krod and vaults them across.    Krod clings and

struggles, then YELPS -

X-Takks hear and scan the pinnacle and moat edges.

On top of the pinnacle, Rush and Krod hunker.      Flynn signals

from the far side "stay down!"

X-Takks patrol below, pausing to gaze up.

Atop the pinnacle, Krod's circuits energy-zap with fear.

Rush holds him down.

At last, X-Takks move on.

Rush extends his light pole to the moat floor - vaults to

the far side with Krod.

Krod stabilizes, looks around.

KROD

Yeah, I recognize this place.    I

know where everything is!

Boole and Code Monk B3t help Flynn to a secluded data buffer.

FLYNN

Rush, up there. See it?

Rush leaps to a high circuitry nexus.

RUSH

I hope you're right about Mega.

Rush touches circuitry, energizing it with data.

Mega's image appears in circuitry energy patterns.

MEGA

You.     Where is Flynn?

RUSH

We're all here.

MEGA

I arranged for your entry. An

encryption portal has been left

unlocked. Path 4786324BXY. Do you

Rush looks down to Code Monk J2r.       He gives a high sign.

117   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER / CIRCUITRY

Mega watches glowing circuity image of Rush.

RUSH

She deactivates.       Rush's image vanishes.

Mega thinks for a moment - we're not sure what - then walks

around a corner.

Bumps smack into:

Plexor.

Flanked by his two snarling Cybavors.

MEGA

Yes.

PLEXOR

And?

MEGA

They will attempt entry soon.

PLEXOR

Perfect.    We will be waiting.

118   EXT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER

Patrols of X-Takks pass.

Rush leaps to a vantage point them. Scouts a route, signals

Flynn, Krod, Boole, Quantz and the Code Monkeys.

Fighter team scales a narrow ledge near the BLAZING FIREWALL.

It's like a sheet of molten lead, pouring endlessly before

them. A lethal barrier.

FLYNN

This is all yours, Rush.

Rush pulls his disk, holds it over his head and steps under

the molten data flow. He struggles against raw power, disk

HEATS UP WHITE, splashing aside the molten data.

FLYNN

Go!    Quick!

Code Monkeys, Flynn and Krod, Quantz and Boole dive between

Rush's legs, emerging on the other side. Barrier overcome.

Rush leaps out of the firewall, clutching his white-hot disk.

RUSH

No sweat.

A Cybavor growls at Mega.          She growls back.

MEGA

There it is.     That's the portal.

Plexor masses his forces around a closed ENCRYPTION PORTAL.

It is a dark semispheric aperture, left unlocked (but closed).

PLEXOR

Converge on all levels! Outside

They come to a dark encryption portal, seen from their

exterior view.

BOOLE

Portal 4786324BXY.       This is it.

Flynn withdraws the HOLOGON.

FLYNN

The sooner Rush gets this into the

main power supply, the sooner X-Net

PLEXOR

CEASE FIRE!

They do so, instantly.

Plexor fumes.

X-Takks are upon them, and the battle is joined.

X-Net disks fly by the hundreds.

Krod and Code Monkeys fire a SQRAM projectile, which opens

mid-air into a super-wide circular magnetic field "net".

SQRAM field sucks in X-Net disk and zaps them to ash.

X-Takks charge.

Rush flips down from above, throws tron-disk -

Disk ricochets of ten X-Takks, mows them down.

Rush retrieves his disk, lands near Krod and Fighters.

RUSH

Block this choke point, slow them

down. Can you guys do it?

QUANTZ

Not a problem.

He throws his disk behind his back, takes out an approaching

X-Net goon.

Rush hurries away with Mega and Flynn.

Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys are besieged by a hundred

X-Takks.

KROD

Whoa! Retreat! That way!     Keep

firing! RUN! AHHH!

Plexor enters the battle arena with his four CYBAVORS.     He

scans keenly, then heads off another direction.

100

127   INT.   X-NET GANTRY / MAIN POWER SUPPLY

Flynn hobbles, helped by Mega.     Rush leads them around a

corner, in sight of:

MAIN POWER SUPPLY.     Massive reactive CORE CONTAINMENT CUBE.

Rush comes to the edge of a deep, narrow moat. Bottom is      a

channel of ROILING, MOLTEN CHROMATIC DATA. No bridges.

RUSH

We have to get across.

RAAAA!!!

Six X-Takks are upon them, disks flying, NegaByte eraser

beams swinging.

Flynn Takes a hit in the chest.

FLYNN

ARRGGHH!

Rush and Mega dodge, fling their disks with lethal accuracy -

X-Takks crash and fall, tumbling into the moat abyss, flashing

as they hit the molten bottom.

128   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER CORRIDORS

Krod, Boole and Quantz bait a phalanx of X-Takks, Code Monkeys

spring a DEGAUSSING CHARGE, which cuts off a column at the

base. Column tumbles, crashing X-Takks, blocking the way.

High fives among Krod and Fighters.

One Small X-Takk breaks through, ZAPPING through the air,

reforming, ZAPPING CLOSER.

Fighters turn to blast him.

But Krod recognizes the pattern:

KROD

Wait!     I know that dude!

Quantz stuns an X-Takk Soldier - Code Monkeys hack his X-Net

Armor. Armor powers down, revealing:

KROD

I-beem!

I-beem shakes off his brainwashing.

(CONTINUED)

101

128   CONTINUED:

I-BEEM

Krod my friend! Who are these guys?!

KROD

We're taking out Plexor.    You with

us or them?

X-Takks attack the group, including I-beem.

I-beem zaps away, reappearing next to an X-Takk. He steals

the X-Takk's NEGABYTE BLASTER and mows down three X-Takks,

saving trapped Boole.

I-BEEM

With you!

I-beem joins Fighters as they press deeper, engaging the

next X-Takk onslaught.

129   INT.   X-NET POWER SUPPLY OUTER GANTRY - CONTINUOUS

Rush and Mega haul Flynn along a narrow ledge.

FLYNN

There.   You can make it across!

He points to a thin ledge on the other side, far below.

Rush extends his Light Pole to the ledge, moves to gather

Flynn for a vault-crossing.

FLYNN

No, take Mega! I'll stay here and

run interference.

RUSH

You haven't got a chance by yourself.

FLYNN

Ah, these guys are wimps.

It's bravado: They know his odds are dismal. Flynn slumps

into an alcove, which is only big enough for him. He pulls

a supply of SPIKED MINI-DISKS, ready to defend himself.

MEGA

We're not leaving you.

FLYNN

My body is weak, but my will is

strong. I promise, no matter what

they do to me, I'll survive this.

Trust the bigger plan.

(CONTINUED)

102

129   CONTINUED:

He's fading fast.

MEGA

But Flynn -

X-Takks attack along the ledge.

FLYNN

GO!   NOW!

Rush throws his arm around Mega and VAULTS across the moat,

landing on the far side - gaining a slim foot-hold below a

core ENTRY POINT.

Flynn chooses his moment, leans out and throws. His mini

disks take out X-Takks on the ledge. Their bodies tumble

into the moat, flashing as they hit.

Flynn spins, the wall behind him opens.       At the end of a

square corridor stands:

PLEXOR.   Flanked by his four snarling Cybavor beasts.

PLEXOR

Flynn. Your moment of obsolescence

is upon you.

Across the moat, Rush and Mega climb to the entry point.

Flynn plays for time, stalling Plexor so he doesn't catch

sight of them.

FLYNN

Freedom, Plexor. It's the better

idea. That's why Mega chose my side.

PLEXOR

If an idea is erased from all memory

banks, it can be neither good nor

bad. When each alternative has been

removed, X-Net will simply BE.

With a hand signal, he commands his Cybavors.         They raise

up, poised to attack Flynn.

FLYNN

Crash me. Hack me. Do what you

want. The yearning for freedom will

last forever.

PLEXOR

Nice speech... USER!

He flicks a finger.       Cybavors gallop at Flynn.

103

130   EXT.   MAIN POWER SUPPLY CORE - LEDGE

Rush and Mega gain footing at the entry point.      They turn at

the sound of DIGITAL SNARLING.

Across the moat, a gut-wrenching sight:

All four Cybavors pounce on Flynn, hurling him off the ledge,

mauling him as they go down, dividing into eight - Plummeting

toward the MOLTEN DATA far below.

Plexor steps out of his corridor, relishing the view:      Remains

of fallen bodies FLASH into the inferno.

MEGA

Noooooo!!!

Plexor sees Mega and Rush on the other side.

PLEXOR

Over there!    Surround them!

Bridges instantly extend from outer square to CORE CUBE.

X-Takks stream across, firing -

131   INT.   POWER SUPPLY CORE CUBE

Rush and Mega duck inside entry point, pelted by disks.

Before them: A vast, brilliant, energized LATTICE. Power

surges in rings, drawing down huge columns. Every piece of

geometry is based on perfect squares, made of mirror-finished

rare earth elements.

Rush pulls the HOLOGON KEY into view. Facets resonate with

energy patterns like those in the core.

RUSH

We plug this into the control cell,

X-Net is history.

MEGA

Let's do it for Flynn.

They share a heartbeat of solidarity.      Rivalry gone.

X-Takks stream in, firing.

Rush and Mega charge the center, throwing disks, fighting

back-to-back.

(CONTINUED)

104

131   CONTINUED:

Problem is, ENERGY RINGS move continuously down the columns -

and the columns are spaced close - leaving just enough time

between ring-passes to jump through.

RUSH

NOW!

He and Mega JUMP, nearly raked by down-flowing ENERGY RINGS.

X-Takks fire NEGABYTE BLASTERS - but many of the beams are

caught in the energy flow and sucked away. That's how intense

this place is.

X-Takk Soldier is grazed, stumbles into ENERGY COLUMN. RING

rakes down and ZAPS him nasty - reducing him to bits, sucking

his energy to the levels below.

Rush and Mega encounter oncoming X-Takks - they must split

up. They fling disks, taking out X-Takks, dodging fire -

working their way deeper.

Meg and Rush throw their disks simultaneously.     Both disks

score hits, then arc to return.

Rush and Mega catch each other's disk. They each look at

the strange disks - it's just not the same. The do a quick

swap and keep fighting.

MEGA

Over there!

The CONTROL CELL.    Dead center.

132   INT.   CONTROL CELL CHAMBER

Rush and Mega battle off three X-Takks - the way is clear.

Rush leaps, crashes planes of silicon.     Stows his disk, pulls

out the HOLOGON.

Spots the control cell's key receptacle - SHAPES MATCH.

Rush moves to insert the hologon.

A DISK STRIKES his arm - HOLOGON flies wild.

RUSH

AAARRGGGHHH!

PLEXOR drops from above, riding an OPTIK SHAFT.

PLEXOR

Where did you get that?!   No one

knows this code but me!

(CONTINUED)

105

132   CONTINUED:

RUSH

Your software has the biggest flaw

there is, Plexor. You can't see you

own mistakes.

Plexor snatches his Death-disk, corners Rush for the kill.

Mega's disk crashes silicon, comes at Plexor - But his

defense field repels it. He slams it aside and it's raked

away by downward flowing energy rings.

Rush DIVES at PLEXOR. He's like a statue. But this time

RUSH holds him and infuses tron-energy, breaking down Plexor's

defense field, eating into his body circuits. It's fractal

zapping fireworks - evenly matched foes battling face-to-

face.

RUSH

Do it Mega!

Mega scoops HOLOGON off floor, makes for CONTROL CELL -

Plexor's hand shoots out, GRABS HER, stops her like iron.

Plexor exerts his power, holds Rush and Mega by the throats

with his two hands, backing them toward a surface ripping

with HOT ENERGY RINGS.

Rush and Mega struggle, an inch from death -

ZAAAAAA -

Plexor stops, annoyed.      Turns and sees:

Krod, Fighters and I-beem have arrived, firing blasters at

Plexor's SPINAL NEXUS. It hardly makes a dent, but it creates

a fleeting opportunity for Rush -

Rush ducks forward, SHOOTS his disk off his back, smacking

Plexor in the throat. Mega falls clear -

Rush hurls Plexor against energy rings - Energy rakes down

his body, but he fights the effects an DOES NOT MELT DOWN.

He step away, shakes off the damage, retrieves his disk into

a hand.

Mega snags the hologon -

MEGA

RUSH!

She tosses it to Rush, who's already airborne -

Rush catches hologon, sails to the control unit -

106

132   CONTINUED:    (2)

Jams hologon into its receptacle.

Plexor cocks his death disk, EYES FLASH ELECTRO-PSYCHOSIS -

Hologon REACTS with CENTRAL CELL -

Shockwaves RADIATE -

Energy rings go dim, then dark -

Silicon shatters to ash -

X-Takks power down. X-Net armor de-rezzes, leaving innocent

civilian Programs. They shake off the mind-control and rise

unshackled.

And Plexor, like all things X-Net, chatters and glitches.

His code erodes, his bits darken, the fiber of his being

erodes from inside.

MEGA

Now who's obsolete?

Rush executes a final leap, extending his feet for the final

blow, straight at Plexor - CRASH - shattering him to bits.

Rush finally breathes.       Sees I-beem, Krod, Quantz, Boole,

Code Monkeys.

RUSH

Thanks guys.

KROD

I'll never let you forget it.

Boole tosses Rush his tron-disk.

133   EXT.   CYBERSPACE VISTA POINT

Rush, Mega, Krod, I-beem, Fighters and liberated Programs

stow disks and step to a high vantage point.

Before them expands a vista of cyberspace.

Power-down of X-Net radiates in all directions, leaving

everything else intact. Beautiful, exotic old data networks

instantly begin to regenerate into the open space.

MEGA

We're free.     At last we're free.

107

134   EXT.   X-NET GRAND OPENING CEREMONY - MORNING

Sinclair commands the podium:

SINCLAIR

In a world exposed to increasing

data corruption, I hereby switch on

the first global network offering

100% guaranteed data security.

Flawless performance, zero downtime.

The world works hard, the world

deserves...

He throws a switch. HUGE monitors blaze with X-Net logos

and graphic portals. Countdown 3,2,1...

SINCLAIR

X-NET!

CROWD CHEERS.   MEDIA BUZZES...

X-Net instantly CRASHES.    All screens jam, glitch and DIE.

Crowd is stunned.    Sinclair is mortified.

135   EXT.   CYBERSPACE VISTA POINT

Krod, I-beem, Boole, Quantz and Code Monkeys CHEER.

Mega embraces Rush.    Energy sizzles between them.

MEGA

I underestimated you.   Thanks.

She presses her lips to his.    It's electric.

KROD

(to I-beem)

You knew she always liked him.

CODE MONK B3T

Is she pinging his EPROM?

CODE MONK J2R

I can't see from here.

But out of triumph, a sudden concern -

Rush's body shoots DATA ENERGY into Mega, into ground

circuits... Lightshow overload intensifies and spreads.

Mega backs away in pain.

108

135   CONTINUED:

RUSH

Whoa, ouch, what?       Ahhhhh!

MEGA

Rush, what is it?

Rush's body DRAINS AWAY into the energized circuitry.

RUSH

Guys!   Mega!     NOOO!

He reaches a hand to Mega.          PAIN ENERGY ZAPS her, but she

clasps his hand anyway...

KROD

Help him!

Code Monkeys attempt desperate measures, but soon it's over.

Bits of Rush dissipate into surrounding circuitry, then BEAM

SKYWARD in blazing curtain, like a quantum aurora borealis.

Mega is left with a handful of nothing.

QUANTZ

It's the way it should be.

BOOLE

He's going back to the place he

belongs.

136   EXT.   CYBERSPACE TRANSITION

Rush's energy body hurls across cyberspace.

Bits streak, light bends -

137   INT.   ENCOM ADVANCED RESEARCH LAB - NIGHT

Rush materializes in the target chair.          Human flesh, real

clothes. Same as the moment he left.

He bolts up, realizes where he is.          Looks at his hands.

Sees Jo-jo the rat staring at him.

Meg and Dewey hurry over to unstrap Rush.          Meg holds his

hands, checks the integrity of his body.

MEG

Rush.   You made it!

109

137   CONTINUED:

RUSH

Like a bad cold, I'm always coming

back.

VOICES

He made it!    Rush! You okay?!

Rush looks around. Miles ("Krod") and a group of oddly-

familiar Co-WORKERS. People who look just like I-beem,

Quantz, Boole and the Code Monkeys.

RUSH

(double-takes on Meg)

I met a program you wrote. She's

just as incredibly beautiful and

confusing as you.

MEG

I know. Mega told me all about what

you did in there.

RUSH

She gave you my coordinates.     That's

how you uploaded me?

MEG

Yes.   Your coordinates...     and his.

They look across the room.

At the control console stands a MAN with his back to us.

He's curiously examining Meg's equipment.

THE GUY

She's done an amazing job here, Rush.

He turns.    It's FLYNN.    In the flesh.    Leg healed.

RUSH

Flynn!

FLYNN

I told you to trust the bigger plan.

MEG

I'd come to suspect Flynn was alive,

inside. But I had no way to know

for sure.

FLYNN

You picked the right guy to send in.

110

137   CONTINUED:    (2)

MEG

Working down here, I became convinced

someone tried to murder Flynn. But

the only person I could confide in

was the guy I suspected most.

Elevator opens.

Sinclair charges in, furious.    Trailed by SECURITY MEN.

SINCLAIR

What are you people doing down here!?!

Get back to work! X-Net has CRASHED!

We'll all be ruined!

FLYNN

Speak for yourself, Sinclair.

Sinclair wheels to see Flynn: Alive, standing in front of

him. Trapped by the ugly truth, Sinclair turns rage on Meg.

SINCLAIR

I ordered you to destroy this

equipment!

Rush gets in Sinclair's face.

RUSH

Hey, jerk, she doesn't do your dirty

work. Neither do I. Not anymore.

You lied to me, to all of us. You

want to deal with somebody? I'm the

guy who crashed X-Net.

Sinclair goes for Rush. Rush delivers a solid punch.

Sinclair grabs his bloody nose.

SINCLAIR

You're fired, everybody get out.

FLYNN

No, Sinclair. I'm back. And I'm

the boss again. You're fired. Not

only are you fired, you're going to

have a lot of explaining to do to

the SEC, the Justice Department and

the FBI.

(to SECURITY MEN)

Hold him until the police get here.

SECURITY MAN 1

Yes Sir, Mr. Flynn.

SECURITY MEN haul out Sinclair.

(CONTINUED)

111

137   CONTINUED:    (3)

Flynn addresses the group.

FLYNN

X-Net is dead. But Encom lives.

We're going to bring this company

back to its place as the leader in

finding the next big thing. I'll

need to be free to do the dreaming.

So, effective immediately, I'm

appointing two bold, bright,

courageous people to head worldwide

operations.

He presents Rush and Meg.        They're stunned.

FLYNN

You both earned it.

RUSH

Cool.

MEG

I love it.

RUSH

We'll take it.

(to Miles - "Krod")

You get a division to run.

MILES

Yes.

(to Phlegman)

Does that mean a bigger cubicle?

Cheers all around.    Flynn approaches Rush and Meg.

FLYNN

Put on some coffee. You two are

going to be putting in a lot of

overtime together.

Meg turns to Rush.

MEG

Do you remember how, along time ago,

you used to give me a professional

congratulatory peck on the cheek?

Rush goes for the lips.

THE END
