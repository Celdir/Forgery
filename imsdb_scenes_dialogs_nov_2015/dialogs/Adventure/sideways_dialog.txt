SATURDAY

MILES (O.S.)

...the fuck...

MILES (O.S.)

Yeah?

WORKER

Hi, Miles. Can you move your car,

please?

MILES (O.S.)

Why?

WORKER

The painters got to put the truck

in, and you didn't park too good.

MILES (O.S.)

(a sigh, then --)

Yeah, hold on.

SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA

MILES

Fuck!

MILES

Yeah, no, I know I said I'd be there

by noon, but there's been all this

work going on at my building, and

it's like a total nightmare, and I

had a bunch of stuff to deal with

this morning. But I'm on my way. I'm

out the door right this second. It's

going to be great. Yeah. Bye.

BARISTA

Hey, Miles.

MILES

Hey, Simon. Triple espresso, please.

BARISTA

Rough night, huh?

(ringing it up)

For here?

MILES

No, I'm running late. Make it to go.

And give me a New York Times and...

(scanning the display

case)

...a spinach croissant.

1/4 MILE

MRS. ERGANIAN

Look what the cat dragged!

MILES

Hi, everybody.

JACK

About time you got here, bud. Mr.

Prompt.

MR. ERGANIAN

We were thinking maybe you took the

wrong way and went to Tijuana and

they didn't let you back in.

MILES

I had to bribe them.

CHRISTINE

Hey, Miles.

MILES

(leaning in to kiss

Christine)

Seriously though, the freeway was

unbelievable today. Unbelievable.

Bumper to bumper the whole way. People

getting an early start on the weekend,

I guess. Granted I got a late start,

but still.

MRS. ERGANIAN

Christine, why don't you ask Miles

about the cake?

CHRISTINE

Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to

the kitchen with me.

JACK

Don't bother him with that. We got

to get going.

CHRISTINE

(taking Miles's hand)

It'll just take a second.

MRS. ERGANIAN

Jack tells us you are publishing a

book. Congratulations.

MR. ERGANIAN

Yes, congratulations.

MILES

Yeah, well, it's not exactly finalized

yet, but, um, there has been some

interest and --

MRS. ERGANIAN

(to Jack)

Your friend is modest.

JACK

Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest.

Indulge them. Don't make me out to

be a liar.

MR. ERGANIAN

What subject is your book? Non-

fiction?

MILES

No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although

there's a lot from my own life, so I

guess technically some of it is non-

fiction.

MR. ERGANIAN

Good, I like non-fiction. There is

so much to know about the world that

I think reading a story someone just

invented is kind of a waste of time.

CHRISTINE

So which one do you like better?

MILES

I like them both, but if pressed I'd

have to say I prefer the dark.

JACK

(to Christine)

See?

JACK

Where the fuck were you, man? I was

dying in there. We were supposed to

be a hundred miles away by now.

MILES

I can't help the traffic.

JACK

Come on. You're fucking hungover.

MILES

Okay, there was a tasting last night.

But I wanted to get us some stuff

for the ride up. Check out the box.

MILES

Why did you tell them my book was

being published?

JACK

You said you had it all lined up.

MILES

No, I didn't. What I said was that

my agent had heard there was some

interest at Conundrum...

JACK

Yeah, Conundrum.

MILES

...and that one of the editors was

passing it up to a senior editor.

She was supposed to hear something

this week, but now it's next week,

and... It's always like this. It's

always a fucking waiting game. I've

been through it too many times

already.

JACK

I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds

like you're in to me.

MILES

It's a long shot, all right? And

Conundrum is just a small specialty

press anyway. I'm not getting my

hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's

it. I've stopped caring.

JACK

But I know it's going to happen this

time. I can feel it. This is the

one. I'm proud of you, man. You're

the smartest guy I know.

MILES

Don't open that now. It's warm.

JACK

Come on, we're celebrating. I say we

pop it.

MILES

That's a 1992 Byron. It's really

rare. Don't open it now. I've been

saving it!

MILES

For Christ's Sake, Jack! You just

wasted like half of it!

JACK

Shut up.

(handing Miles a glass)

Here's to a great week.

MILES

(coming around)

Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass

behavior, I'm really glad we're

finally getting this time together.

JACK

Yeah.

MILES

You know how long I've been begging

to take you on the wine tour. I was

beginning to think it was never going

to happen.

JACK

Oh, that's tasty.

MILES

100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard.

They don't even make it anymore.

JACK

Pinot Noir? How come it's white?

Doesn't noir mean dark?

MILES

Jesus. Don't ask questions like that

up in the wine country. They'll think

you're a moron.

JACK

Just tell me.

MILES

Color in the red wines comes from

the skins. This juice is free run,

so there's no skin contact in the

fermentation, ergo no color.

JACK

(not really listening)

Sure is tasty.

MILES

Did you read the latest draft, by

the way?

JACK

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

MILES

And?

JACK

I liked it a lot. A lot of

improvements. It just seemed overall,

I don't know, tighter, more...

congealed or something.

MILES

How about the new ending? Did you

like that?

JACK

Oh yeah. Much better.

MILES

There is no new ending. Page 750 on

is exactly the same.

JACK

Well, then I guess it must have felt

new because everything leading up to

it was so different.

JACK

(looking at the phone)

It's Christine.

(snapping it open)

Hey you.

CHRISTINE (ON PHONE)

You guys having fun?

JACK

Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have

been a blast.

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

Good. That's good.

JACK

So what's up?

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

Just seeing how you're doing. And,

um, Mom and I were starting to look

over the seating charts again, and

we're wondering if you wanted Tony

Levin to sit next to the Feldmans,

or should he be at one of the singles

tables?

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

So what do you think? With the

Feldmans?

JACK

Yeah. The Feldmans.

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

Really? Because I don't know, I was

thinking that --

JACK

Well, then put him at the singles

table.

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

The problem with that is that then

there's one extra --

JACK

Then put him with the Feldmans.

Whatever you and your Mom decide is

fine with me.

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to

include you in this decision. He's

your friend.

JACK

I didn't dismiss you. I told you

what I thought, but it didn't seem

to matter, so you decide. Besides,

this is supposed to be my time with

Miles. I hope you're not going to

call every five minutes.

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

I'm not going to call every five

minutes, but this is important.

JACK

Honey, I'm just saying you know I

need a little space before the

wedding. Isn't that the point of

this? Isn't that what we talked about

with Dr. Gertler?

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

Why are you being so defensive?

JACK

I don't know, Christine. Perhaps

it's because I feel attacked.

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

I ask you one simple question, and

suddenly I'm attacking you.

JACK

Listen. I'll call you when we get

there, and we can talk about it then,

okay?

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

Bye.

JACK

I love you.

CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)

Bye.

MILES

Tony Levin? Why did you fucking invite

Tony Levin?

JACK

Whoa, why are we getting off?

MILES

I've just got to make one quick stop.

Won't take a second.

JACK

What?

MILES

I thought we could just say a quick

hello to my mother.

JACK

Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were

supposed to be up there hours ago.

MILES

It's her birthday tomorrow. And I

don't feel right driving by her house

and not stopping in, okay? It'll

just take a second. She's right off

the freeway.

JACK (O.S.)

How old's she going to be?

MILES (O.S.)

Um... seventy... something.

JACK (O.S.)

That's a good age.

OXNARD, CALIFORNIA

MILES

Wait a second.

MILES AND JACK

Surprise! Happy Birthday!

PHYLLIS

My God. Miles. And Jack! What a

surprise. I can't remember the last

time you brought me flowers.

JACK

They're from both of us.

PHYLLIS

A famous actor bringing me flowers

on my birthday. Don't I feel special?

MILES

A famous actor who's getting married

next week.

PHYLLIS

Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I

hope that girls knows how lucky she

is, marrying no less than Derek

Summersby.

JACK

Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven

years ago.

PHYLLIS

Well, you were wonderful on that

show. I never understood why they

had to give you that brain tumor so

soon. Why that didn't make you the

biggest movie star in the world is a

sin. It's a sin.

JACK

Yeah, well, you should be my agent.

PHYLLIS

If I was, I would sing your praises

up and down the street until they

put me in the loony bin. Now Miles,

why didn't you tell me you were coming

and bringing this handsome man? Look

how I'm dressed. I've got to run and

put my face on.

JACK

You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.

PHYLLIS

(over her shoulder)

Oh, stop it. Make yourselves

comfortable.

(now around the corner)

You boys hungry?

MILES

Yeah, I'm hungry.

MILES

(low)

Just a snack. Calm down.

MILES

Let me show you something. The secret

to opening champagne is that once

the cork is released, you keep

pressure on it so you don't --

JACK

(concentrated on the

TV)

Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.

PHYLLIS (O.S.)

Ready for my close up!

PHYLLIS

Oh, champagne! Miles, why don't you

bring that out onto the lanai? I

thought we could eat on the lanai.

JACK

Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious.

Absolutely delicious.

PHYLLIS

(sitting)

They're just leftovers.

JACK

Is it chicken?

PHYLLIS

I could have made something fancier

if a certain someone had let me know

that a certain someone was coming

for a visit with a certain special

friend. Could have made a pork roast.

MILES

It was a surprise, Mom.

PHYLLIS

And I could have already put clean

sheets on the other bed and the fold-

out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and

the twins are picking us up at 11:30

to go to brunch at the Sheraton.

They do a magnificent job there.

Wendy is so excited you're coming.

MILES

You talked to Wendy?

PHYLLIS

Just now. She's thrilled. And the

kids.

MILES

(trying to be chipper)

Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty

eager to get up to... you know, but,

uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.

PHYLLIS

Well, you boys do what you want. I

just think it would be nice for us

to be together as a family on my

birthday.

MILES

Uh-huh.

(wiping his mouth)

I'll be right back.

MILES

(quickly peeling some

off)

...six, seven, eight,...

(one more for good

luck)

Nine.

PHYLLIS

And what was that other one you did,

the one where you're the jogger?

JACK

Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That

was for Spray and Wash.

PHYLLIS

Spray and Wash. That's the one.

JACK

Yeah, I remember the girl who was in

it with me. She was something.

PHYLLIS

I just remember you jogging. So when's

the wedding?

MILES

(irritated)

This Saturday, Mom, remember? We

told you.

JACK

And Miles is my best man, Mrs.

Raymond. My main man.

PHYLLIS

(another drink of

wine)

Miles, when are you going to get

married again?

MILES

I just got divorced. Phyllis.

JACK

Two years ago, buddy.

PHYLLIS

You should get back together with

Victoria. She was good for you.

PHYLLIS

She was good for you.

(turning to Jack)

And so beautiful and intelligent.

You knew her, right?

JACK

Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.

PHYLLIS

I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you

need some money?

MILES

I'm fine.

CUT TO BLACK:

SUNDAY

MILES (O.S.)

Jack. Jack.

MILES

(a loud whisper)

She'll wake up.

JACK

Fuck, man. Too early in the morning

for that, you know what I mean?

MILES

She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look

at that stuff anymore.

JACK

That's your problem, Miles.

MILES

As if she'd even be attracted to

guys like us in the first place.

JACK

Speak for yourself. I get chicks

looking at me all the time. All ages.

MILES

It's not worth it. You pay too big a

price. It's never free.

JACK

You need to get laid.

JACK

It'd be the best thing for you. You

know what? I'm going to get you laid

this week. That's going to be my

best man gift to you. I'm not going

to give you a pen knife or a gift

certificate or any of that other

horseshit.

MILES

I'd rather have a knife.

JACK

No. No. You've been officially

depressed for like two years now,

and you were always a negative guy

anyway, even in college. Now it's

worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching

English to fucking eighth-graders

when they should be reading what you

wrote. Your books.

MILES

I'm working on it.

JACK

You still seeing that shrink?

MILES

I went on Monday. But I spent most

of the time helping him with his

computer.

JACK

Well, I say fuck therapy and what's

that stuff you take, Xanax?

MILES

And Lexapro, yes.

JACK

Well, I say fuck that. You need to

get your joint worked on, that's

what you need.

MILES

Jack. This week is not about me.

It's about you. I'm going to show

you a good time. We're going to drink

a lot of good wine, play some golf,

eat some great food, enjoy the scenery

and send you off in style.

JACK

And get your bone smooched.

JACK

What?

MILES

You know what? Let's take the Santa

Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.

JACK

Whatever's closest, man. I need a

glass.

MILES

These guys make top-notch Pinot and

Chardonnay. One of the best producers

in Santa Barbara county.

(looking out the window)

Look how beautiful this view is.

What a day!

JACK

I thought you hated Chardonnay.

MILES

I like all varietals. I just don't

generally like the way they manipulate

Chardonnay in California -- too much

oak and secondary malolactic

fermentation.

MILES

Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous?

And the ocean's just right over that

ridge. See, the reason this region's

great for Pinot is that the cold air

off the Pacific flows in at night

through these transverse valleys and

cools down the berries. Pinot's a

very thin-skinned grape and doesn't

like heat or humidity.

JACK

Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel

sells.

MILES

Thanks, Jack. So do I.

(noticing)

Here we are.

MILES

So what'd you guys finally decide on

for the menu?

JACK

I told you. Filet and salmon.

MILES

Yeah, but how are they making the

salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill

sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?

JACK

I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always

have white wine with fish?

MILES

Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we

have to find out because it's going

to make a big difference.

JACK

(taking out his phone)

Let me call Christine.

MILES

Doesn't have to be now. Let's go

taste.

JACK

I owe her a call anyway.

JACK

Hey, honey. So we're up here about

to taste some whites, and we need to

know how the caterers are going to

make the salmon.

JACK

No, I know, I didn't forget, but we

wound up at Miles's mom's house, and

it got really late, and it was hard

to call, so I'm calling you now. I

said I was sorry. Yes, I did.

(to Miles)

You heard me say I was sorry, right?

JACK

Miles heard me say I was sorry.

JACK

Give me a break, will you? I just

called to find out about the salmon --

for our wedding -- to be more

involved, like you said -- and all

you want to do is get into it about

last night and, okay, I'm sorry. I'm

sorry I didn't call. You're totally

right. I know, but I'm trying to

make this the best wedding I can

with the best wine we can find. Don't

I get any credit for that? Okay.

Look, I've got to go. I'm out here

in the parking lot, and Miles is

waiting for me...

JACK

(proudly)

Baked with a butter-lime glaze.

MILES

Now we're talking.

CHRIS

This is the condemned man?

MILES

Here he is. Jack, Chris. Chris, Jack.

JACK

How you doing?

CHRIS

You guys want to start with the Vin

Gris?

JACK

Sounds good.

JACK

This is rose, right?

MILES

Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this

one is rather atypically made from

100% Pinot Noir.

JACK

Pinot noir? Not again!

(joking, to Chris)

You know, not all Pinots are noir.

MILES

Let me show you.

MILES

First take your glass and examine

the wine against the light. You're

looking at color and clarity.

JACK

What color is it supposed to be?

MILES

Depends on the varietal. Just get a

sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery?

Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...

JACK

Huh.

MILES

Now tip it. What you're doing here

is checking for color density as it

thins toward the rim. Tells you how

old it is, among other things, usually

more important with reds. This is a

very young wine, so it's going to

retain its color pretty solidly. Now

stick your nose in it.

MILES

Don't be shy. Get your nose in there.

MILES

What do you smell?

JACK

I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?

MILES

There's not much there yet, but you

can still find...

(more sniffs)

...a little citrus... maybe some

strawberry... passion fruit... and

there's even a hint of like

asparagus... or like a nutty Edam

cheese.

JACK

Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah,

strawberry. I'm not so sure about

the cheese.

MILES

Now set your glass down and get some

air into it.

MILES

Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks

the aroma and the flavors. Very

important. Now we smell again.

MILES

That's what you do with every one.

JACK

When do we get to drink it?

MILES

Now.

JACK

How would you rate this one?

MILES

Usually they start you on the wines

with learning disabilities, but this

one's pretty damn good.

(to Chris)

This is the new one, right, Chris?

CHRIS

Released it about two months ago.

MILES

Nice job.

CHRIS

We like it.

JACK

(to Miles)

You know, you could work in a wine

store.

MILES

Yeah, that would be a good move.

MILES

Are you chewing gum?

JACK

Want some?

SOLVANG

BUELLTON

MILES

Hey Jack, hurry up!

JACK (O.S.)

Just a minute!

JACK

I thought you said it was close. Now

I'm all pitted out.

MILES

It's not even a mile.

JACK

We should have driven.

MILES

Not with the wine list these people

have. We don't want to hold back.

JACK

You think I'm making a mistake

marrying Christine?

MILES

Whoa.

JACK

Come on, do you think I'm doing the

right thing? Tell the truth. You've

been through it.

MILES

Well, you waited for good reason,

and you proposed to Christine for

some good reason. So I think it's

great. It's time. You've got to have

your eyes open, that's all. I mean,

look at me. I thought Victoria and I

were set for life.

JACK

Christine's dad -- he's been talking

about bringing me into his property

business. Showing me the ropes. And

that's something, considering how

long it took him to get over I'm not

Armenian. So I'm thinking about it.

But I don't know, might get a little

incestuous. But Mike does pretty

well. A lot of high-end commercial

stuff.

MILES

So you're going to stop acting?

JACK

No way. This would just provide some

stability is what I'm saying. I can

always squeeze in an audition or a

commercial here and there, you know,

keep myself in the game in case

something big comes along.

MILES

Uh-huh.

JACK

We're not getting any younger, right?

And my career, well, it's gotten

pretty, you know, frustrating. Even

with my new manager. Maybe it's time

to settle down.

MILES

If that's what feels right.

JACK

(convincing himself)

It does. Feels right.

MILES

Then it's a good thing.

JACK

(nodding, feeling

better)

Yeah. It's good. Feels good.

GARY

Hey, Miles. Long time no see.

MILES

Gary.

GARY

When's that novel of yours coming

out?  We  all want to read it.

MILES

Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy

Jack. He's getting married next week.

GARY

(shaking Jack's hand)

My condolences.

MILES

What are you pouring tonight?

GARY

Lot of good stuff.

(looking at a row of

bottles)

Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?

MILES

Absolutement.

(to Jack)

They have their own label that's

just outstanding.

GARY

What do you think?

MILES

Tight as a nun's asshole but qood

concentration. Nice fruit.

JACK

Yeah. Tight.

MILES

(to Gary)

Pour us a couple.

JACK

Here's to my last week of freedom.

MILES

It's going to be great. Here's to

us.

JACK

Miles. Check it out.

MILES

Oh, yeah. That's Maya.

JACK

You know her?

MILES

Sure I know Maya.

JACK

You know that chick?

MILES

Jack, this is where I eat when I

come up here. It's practically my

office. And sometimes I have a drink

with the employees. Maya's great.

She's worked here about a year, maybe

a year and a half.

JACK

She is very hot.

MILES

And very nice. And very married.

Check out the rock.

JACK

Doesn't mean shit. When Christine

was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she

wore a big engagement ring to keep

guys from hitting on her. Think it

worked? Fuck no. How do you think I

met her?

MILES

This gal's married to I think a

Philosophy professor at UC Santa

Barbara.

JACK

So what's a professor's wife doing

waitressing? Obviously that's over.

MILES

You don't know anything about this

woman. Calm down. Let's just eat,

okay?

(focusing on the menu)

The duck is excellent and pairs nicely

with the Highliner Pinot.

MAYA

Hey, Miles. Good to see you.

MILES

Maya, how are you?

MAYA

I'm doing good, good. You look great.

Did you lose some weight?

MILES

Oh, no, actually. Busy night.

MAYA

Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been

out tasting today?

MILES

You know it. This is my friend Jack.

Jack, Maya.

JACK

(big smile)

Hiya.

MAYA

(smiling back)

Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here.

Bye, Miles.

JACK

Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes

you. What else do you know about

her?

MILES

Well, she does know a lot about wine.

JACK

Ooooooohh. Now we're getting

somewhere.

MILES

And she likes Pinot.

JACK

Perfect.

MILES

Jack, she's a fucking waitress in

Buellton. How would that ever work?

JACK

Why do you always focus on the

negative? Didn't you see how friendly

she was to you?

MILES

She works for tips!

JACK

You're blind, dude. Blind.

MILES

I also recommend the ostrich. Very

lean. Locally raised.

MILES

I hate Tony Levin.

MAYA

(to Gary)

Highliner, please.

JACK

That's on us.

MAYA

Hey, guys.

MILES

You want to join us?

MAYA

(polite)

Sure.

MAYA

So how's that book of yours going,

Miles? I think you were almost done

with it last time we talked.

MILES

I finished it.

MAYA

Good for you.

JACK

It's getting published. That's what

we're up here celebrating.

MAYA

That's fantastic. Congratulations.

MAYA

(to Jack)

Are you a writer too?

JACK

No, I'm an actor.

MAYA

Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?

JACK

A lot of TV. I was a regular on a

couple of series. And lately I've

been doing a lot of commercials.

National mostly.

MAYA

Anything I'd know?

JACK

Maybe. Recognize this?

JACK

"Now with low, low 5.8% APR

financing."

MAYA

That's hilarious. You sound just

like one of those guys.

JACK

I am one of those guys.

MAYA

You are not.

MILES

He is.

JACK

(very fast)

Consult your doctor before using

this product. Side effects may include

oily discharge, dizziness, hives,

loss of appetite, difficulty breathing

and low blood pressure. If you have

diabetes or a history of kidney

trouble... you're fucked!

MAYA

(winding down)

Oh. I needed that. Thank you.

MAYA

So what are you guys up to tonight?

MILES

We're pretty wiped. Probably go back

to the hotel and crash.

MAYA

Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a

long drive up here. Where're you

staying?

MILES

The Windmill.

JACK

Windmill.

MAYA

Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.

MILES

See you.

JACK

We'll catch up with you later, okay?

JACK

We'll probably go back to the hotel

and crash?

JACK

The girl is looking to party, and

you tell her we're going to go back

to our motel room and crash? Jesus,

Miles!

MILES

Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?

JACK

The chick digs you. She lit up like

a pinball machine when she heard

your novel was getting published.

MILES

Now I've got another lie to live

down. Thanks, Jack.

JACK

I'm trying to get you some action,

but you've got to help me out just a

little bit.

MILES

Didn't seem to me like that's what

was going on. You were all over her.

JACK

Somebody had to do the talking. And

by the way, I was right. She's not

married.

MILES

How do you know?

JACK

No rock. When she came to the bar,

sans rock.

JACK

Single. Waitress. Getting off work.

Looking for love. A little slap and

tickle.

MILES

Shut up.

JACK

She probably went home, lit some

candles, put on some relaxing music,

took a nice hot bath, and laid down

on her bed with her favorite vibrator.

MILES

Have you no shame?

JACK

Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.

MILES

Fuck you.

MILES

Shut the fuck up!

JACK

You need to get your prostate checked.

MONDAY

MILES

So what're we going to have? Pigs in

a blanket? The "rancher's special

breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease

and fat with a side of lard?

JACK

(not amused)

So what's the plan today?

MILES

We head north, begin the grape tour

up there, make our way south so the

more we drink the closer we get to

the motel.

MILES

What's your problem?

MILES

What is it?

JACK

I am going to get my nut on this

trip, Miles. And you are not going

to fuck it up for me with all your

depression and anxiety and neg-head

downer shit.

MILES

Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.

JACK

Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do

not fuck with me. I am going to get

laid before I settle down on Saturday.

Do you read me?

MILES

Sure, big guy. Whatever you say.

It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in

the way and dragging you down. Maybe

you'd have a better time on your

own. You take the car. I'll catch

the train back.

JACK

No, see, I want both of us to get

crazy. We should both be cutting

loose. I mean, this is our last

chance. This is our week! It should

be something we share.

WAITRESS

Can I take your order?

JACK

But I am warning you.

MILES

Oatmeal, one poached egg, and rye

toast. Dry.

WAITRESS

Okay. And you?

JACK

(glaring at Miles)

Pigs in a blanket. With extra syrup.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MILES

How much skin and stem contact?

POURER

About four weeks.

MILES

Huh. That explains all the tannins.

And how long in oak?

POURER

About a year.

MILES

French or American?

POURER

Both.

MILES

Good stuff.

JACK

Yeah, oak. That's a good wood.

DISSOLVE TO:

MILES

Nice, huh?

JACK

Beautiful.

MILES

Victoria and I used to like this

view.

(lost in nostalgia)

Once we had a picnic here and drank

a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon

and artichokes, but we didn't care.

JACK

Miles.

MILES

She has the best palate of any woman

I've ever known. She could even

differentiate Italian wines.

JACK

Miles, I gotta tell you something.

Victoria's coming to the wedding.

MILES

I know. You told me. I'm okay with

it.

JACK

Yeah, but that's not the whole story.

She got remarried.

MILES

She what?

(long pause)

When?

JACK

About a month ago. Six weeks.

MILES

To that guy? That guy with the

restaurant...

JACK

Miles... MILES...

JACK

(exploding)

Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!

MILES

I want to go home now.

JACK

You've been divorced for two years

already. People move on. She has!

It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes

you feel special or something.

MILES

Is she bringing him to the wedding?

JACK

What do you think?

MILES

You drop this bombshell on me. Why

didn't you tell me before?

JACK

Because I knew you'd freak out and

probably get so depressed you wouldn't

even come on this trip. But then I

figured here would be the best place

to tell you. We're here to forget

about all that shit. We're here to

party!

MILES

(undeterred)

I'm going to be a fucking pariah.

Everyone's just going to be holding

their breath to see if I'm going to

get drunk and make a scene. Plus

Tony fucking Levin?

JACK

No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to

Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's

cool.

MILES

(horrified)

You've all been talking about it?

Behind my back? Talking about it?

JACK

Hey, hey, hey. No, you don't!

JACK

Miles?

JACK

You going to be okay?

DISSOLVE TO:

STEPHANIE

Hey, guys. How's it going?

JACK

Excellent. My friend and I are up

here doing the wine tour, and he

tells me that you folks make one

hell of a Syrah.

STEPHANIE

That's what people say.

MILES

(slurring slightly)

You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he

didn't know Pinot Noir from film

noir.

JACK

I'm a quick learner.

MILES

I'm trying to teach my friend here

some basics about wine over the next

few days before he goes off and --

JACK

That's right -- I'm here to learn. I

never had that much interest in wine

before, but this trip has been very

enlightening. Always like wine, of

course, but I don't know. More of a

beer man, really. Microbreweries.

STEPHANIE

Well, no better way to learn than

tasting.

JACK

Now there's a girl who knows how to

pour. What's your name?

STEPHANIE

Stephanie.

JACK

Nice.

STEPHANIE

So what do you think?

MILES

Quaffable but far from transcendent.

JACK

I like it. Tastes great. Oaky.

STEPHANIE

Cabernet Franc.

(as they taste)

This is only the fifth year we've

made this varietal. Very few wineries

around here do a straight Cabernet

Franc. It's from our vineyard up in

Santa Maria. And it was a Silver

Medal winner at Paso Robles last

year.

MILES

Well, I've come to never expect

greatness from a Cab Franc, and this

one's no exception. Sort of a flabby,

overripe --

JACK

(ignoring him)

Tastes good to me. You live around

here, Stephanie?

STEPHANIE

In Santa Ynez.

(low, to Miles)

And I agree with you about Cab Franc.

JACK

Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton.

Windmill Inn.

STEPHANIE

Oh yeah.

JACK

You know a gal named Maya? Works at

the Hitching Post?

STEPHANIE

Sure I know Maya. Real well.

JACK

No shit. We just had a drink with

her last night. Miles knows her.

MILES

Could we move on to the Syrah, please?

STEPHANIE

This is our Estate Syrah...

JACK

You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

STEPHANIE

I know. I might need to be spanked.

STEPHANIE

Excuse me.

JACK

A bad girl, Miles. She might need to

be spanked.

MILES

Do you know how often these pourers

get hit on?

JACK

Get the trunk.

MILES

You have the keys.

JACK

We're on.

MILES

What?

JACK

She called Maya, who's not working

tonight, so we're all going out.

MILES

With Maya?

JACK

Been divorced for a year now, bud.

JACK

Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it

all going on.

MILES

Well, she is cute.

JACK

Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And

you almost tell her I'm getting

married. What's the matter with you?

(drumming on the

steering wheel)

Gotta love it. Gotta love it.

JACK

(mocking)

You know how often these pourers get

hit on?

(getting up)

I'm going for a swim. Get the blood

flowing. Want to come?

MILES

Nah. I want to watch this.

JACK

Miles. Hey, Miles. Time to get up.

JACK

Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi --

goddamn, Miles, fucking going nuts

up here. Whole place is wide open.

Assylvania.

MILES

So what should I wear?

JACK

I don't know. Casual but nice. They

think you're a writer.

JACK

Don't you have any other shoes?

JACK

(into the phone)

Hello? Oh hey, baby, just checking

in. Not much. We're about to go out

for dinner, probably be out pretty

late, so I thought I'd say goodnight

now. I know, I love you too. I miss

you.

JACK

Please just try to be your normal

humorous self, okay? Like who you

were before the tailspin. Do you

remember that guy? People love that

guy. And don't forget -- your novel

is coming out in the fall.

MILES

Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it

called?

JACK

Do not sabotage me. If you want to

be a lightweight, that's your call.

But do not sabotage me.

MILES

Aye-aye, captain.

JACK

And if they want to drink Merlot,

we're drinking Merlot.

MILES

(dead serious)

If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving.

I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!

JACK

Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No

Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?

JACK

And don't drink too much. I don't

want you going to the dark side or

passing out. Do you hear me? No going

to the dark side.

MILES

Okay! Fuck!

JACK

We're going in.

JACK

How you doin' tonight, beautiful?

STEPHANIE

Good. How're you?

JACK

Great. You look great.

(including Maya)

You both do.

STEPHANIE

Not so bad yourself.

MILES

What are you drinking?

MAYA

A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.

MILES

Oh yeah? How is it?

MAYA

(sliding the glass)

Try it.

MILES

Nice. Very nice.

MAYA

Twelve months in oak.

MILES

On a Sauvignon Blanc?

MAYA

I know the winemaker. She comes in

the restaurant all the time.

MILES

This is good. Little hints of clove.

MAYA

I know. I love that.

WAITER

...medallions of pork with a dusting

of black truffles served with a root

vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped

potatoes. And finally a Copper River

salmon grilled on an alder wood plank.

And that comes with roasted new

potatoes and steamed watercress.

WAITER

And who gets the wine list?

MAYA

(teasing)

I guess Miles wants it.

MILES

Nope. You ladies choose.

MAYA

You choose, Stephanie.

STEPHANIE

(opening it)

So what does everyone feel like?

JACK

Whatever you girls want. It's on us

tonight. Sky's the limit.

MAYA

No, we're paying for the wine.

JACK

I don't think so. We're celebrating

Miles's book deal.

MAYA

Well, in that case...

STEPHANIE

What's everyone ordering? Then we

can sort out the wine.

MILES

Exactement!

MAYA

I'm having the salmon.

MILES

That's what I'm having.

STEPHANIE

(still scanning the

wines)

I'm thinking about the duck breast.

JACK

(slapping his menu

shut)

Me too.

MAYA

Well, that narrows things down.

STEPHANIE

Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me.

JACK

Pinot!

VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)

Hello?

MILES

Victoria.

VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)

Miles?

MILES

Victoria! How the hell are you?

VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)

Fine. What's, uh, what's on your

mind?

MILES

Heard you got remarried!

Congratulations. Didn't think you

had the stomach for another go-round.

VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)

Oh, Miles. You're drunk.

MILES

Just some local Pinot, you know,

then a little Burgundy. That old

Cotes de Beaune!

VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)

Where are you?

MILES

A little place in Los Olivos. New

owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent

food too -- you should try it. Thought

of you at the Hitching Post last

night.

MILES (CONT' D)

Hello?

VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)

Miles, don't call me when you're

drunk.

MILES

I just wanted you to know I've decided

not to go to the wedding, so in case

you were dreading some uncomfortable,

you know, run-in or something, well,

worry no more. You won't see me there.

My wedding gift to you and what's-

his-name. What is his name?

VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)

(silence, then --)

Ken.

MILES

Ken.

VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)

Miles, I don't care if you come to

the wedding or not.

MILES

Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you

guys have fun.

VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)

I'm going to hang up now, Miles.

MILES

(rushing to keep her

on)

You see, Vicki, I just heard about

this today, you getting married that

is, and I was kind of taken aback.

Kind of hard to believe.

MILES

I guess I just thought there was

still some hope for us somewhere

down the road and I just, I just --

VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)

Miles, maybe it is better if you

don't come to the wedding.

MILES

Whatever you say, Vicki. You're the

boss.

JACK

Easy, boy. Easy.

MAYA

Are you all right?

MILES

Fine. Just slipped.

(picking up his glass)

This is my blood.

STEPHANIE

(to the guys)

Excuse us.

MAYA

Sorry to make you get up again, Miles.

MILES

That's okay.

JACK

What the fuck, man? What is up?

JACK

Pull yourself together, man.

MILES

I'm fine!

JACK

Where were you?

MILES

Bathroom.

JACK

Did you drink and dial?

JACK

Why do you always do this? Victoria's

gone, man. Gone. Poof.

JACK

Stop it. You are blowing a great

opportunity here, Miles. Fucking

Maya, man. She's great. She's cool.

She's funny. She knows wine. What is

this morose come-down bullshit? These

girls want to party. And what was

that fucking ten-minute lecture on,

what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come

on!

MILES

Let's just say I'm uncomfortable

with the whole scenario.

JACK

Oh Jesus, Miles.

JACK

And don't forget all the bad times

you had with Victoria. How small she

make you feel. That's why you had

the affair in the first place.

MILES

Shut up. Shut your face.

JACK

Don't you see how Maya's looking at

you? You got her on the hook. Reel

her in! Come on, let's rachet this

up a notch. You know how to to do

it. Here.

(passing a glass)

Drink some agua.

MILES

(trying to appear

sober)

Should we get dessert?

STEPHANIE

We were thinking. Why don't we go

back to my place? I've got wine,

some insane cheeses, music, whatever.

JACK

Excellent idea. Waiter!

JACK

(grabbing the map)

Let me see that.

JACK

(tearing)

Here. One for you, three for me.

MILES

You sure you want to do this?

JACK

We're here!

STEPHANIE

What happened to you guys?

JACK

Couple of wrong turns.

(pointing a thumb at

Miles)

Thanks to Magellan, here.

JACK

Hi.

STEPHANIE

Hi.

(to Miles)

Maya's in the kitchen.

MILES

Hi.

MAYA

Hey.

MILES

She got anything good?

MAYA

Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots

and Syrahs.

(calling out)

Hey, Steph? You sure we can open

anything? Anything we want?

STEPHANIE (V.O.)

Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!

MILES

She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I

have completely underestimated

Stephanie.

MAYA

Who do you think you're dealing with

here?

MAYA

How about this?

MAYA

Nope. I don't think we know each

other well enough.

(picking out another

bottle)

I'd say this guy's more our speed.

MAYA

So what gems do you have in your

collection?

MILES

Not much of a collection really. I

haven't had the wallet for that, so

I sort of live bottle to bottle. But

I've got a couple things I'm saving.

I guess the star would be a 1961

Cheval Blanc.

MAYA

You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's

just sitting there? Go get it.

(pushing him, playfully

stern)

Right now. Hurry up...

MAYA

Seriously, the '61s are peaking,

aren't they? At least that's what

I've read.

MILES

Yeah, I know.

MAYA

It might be too late already. What

are you waiting for?

MILES

I don't know. Special occasion. With

the right person. It was supposed to

be for my tenth wedding anniversary.

MAYA

The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc,

that's the special occasion.

MILES

How long have you been into wine?

MAYA

I started to get serious about seven

years ago.

MILES

What was the bottle that did it?

MAYA

Eighty-eight Sassicaia.

MILES

Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but

this is tasty. Really good. How about

you?

MAYA

(tastes again)

I think they overdid it a bit. Too

much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.

MILES

(tasting again,

impressed)

Yeah, I'd say you're right on the

money.

MILES

Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is

cute.

MAYA

Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.

MILES

Is she sleeping or...?

MAYA

She's with her grandmother. She's

with Steph's mom. She spends a lot

of time over there. Steph's... well,

she's Stephanie.

JACK (O.S.)

"And now for a low, low 4.8% APR..."

MAYA

You got kids?

MILES

Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up.

That was the one unpolluted part of

my divorce -- no kids.

MAYA

Yeah, same here.

MAYA

Let's go in there.

MAYA

Looks like our friends are hitting

it off.

MAYA

It's kind of weird sitting here with

you in Stephanie's house. All those

times you came into the restaurant.

It's like you're a real person now.

Almost.

MILES

Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird.

Out of context.

MAYA

Yeah, weird. But great.

MILES

Yeah. Definitely.

MAYA

So what's your novel about?

MILES

Well, it's a little difficult to

summarize. It begins as a first-person

account of a guy taking care of his

father after a stroke. Kind of based

on personal experience, but only

loosely.

MAYA

What's the title?

MILES

"The Day After Yesterday."

MAYA

Oh. You mean... today?

MILES

Um... yeah but it's more...

MAYA

So is it kind of about death and

mortality, or...?

MILES

Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It

shifts around a lot. Like you also

start to see everything from the

point of view of the father. And

some other stuff happens, some

parallel narrative, and then it

evolves -- or devolves -- into a

kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery --

you know, with no real resolution.

MAYA

Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing

you're getting it published. Really.

I know how hard it is. Just to write

it even.

MILES

(squeezing it out)

Yeah. Thanks.

MAYA

Like me, I have this stupid paper

due on Friday, and as usual I'm

freaked out about it. Just like in

high school. It never changes.

MILES

A paper?

MAYA

Yeah. I'm working on a masters in

horticulture. Chipping away at it.

MILES

Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know

there was a college here.

MAYA

I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a

week.

MILES

So... you want to work for a winery

or something someday?

MAYA

Well...

MILES

I do have a copy of the manuscript

in the car. It's not fully proofed,

but if you're okay with a few typos...

MAYA

Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of

typos.

(sipping the wine)

Wow, this is really starting to open

up. What do you think?

MILES

My palate's kind of shot, but from

what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty

damn good.

MAYA

Can I ask you a personal question?

MILES

(bracing himself)

Sure.

MAYA

Why are you so into Pinot? It's like

a thing with you.

MILES

I don't know. It's a hard grape to

grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned,

temperamental, ripens early. It's

not a survivor like Cabernet that

can grow anywhere and thrive even

when neglected. Pinot needs constant

care and attention and in fact can

only grow in specific little tucked-

away corners of the world. And only

the most patient and nurturing growers

can do it really, can tap into Pinot's

most fragile, delicate qualities.

Only when someone has taken the time

to truly understand its potential

can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest

expression. And when that happens,

its flavors are the most haunting

and brilliant and subtle and thrilling

and ancient on the planet.

MILES

I mean, Cabernets can be powerful

and exalting, but they seem prosaic

to me for some reason. By comparison.

How about you?

MAYA

What about me?

MILES

I don't know. Why are you into wine?

MAYA

I suppose I got really into wine

originally through my ex-husband. He

had a big, kind of show-off cellar.

But then I found out that I have a

really sharp palate, and the more I

drank, the more I liked what it made

me think about.

MILES

Yeah? Like what?

MAYA

Like what a fraud he was.

MAYA

No, but I do like to think about the

life of wine, how it's a living thing.

I like to think about what was going

on the year the grapes were growing,

how the sun was shining that summer

or if it rained... what the weather

was like. I think about all those

people who tended and picked the

grapes, and if it's an old wine, how

many of them must be dead by now. I

love how wine continues to evolve,

how every time I open a bottle it's

going to taste different than if I

had opened it on any other day.

Because a bottle of wine is actually

alive -- it's constantly evolving

and gaining complexity. That is,

until it peaks -- like your '61 --

and begins its steady, inevitable

decline. And it tastes so fucking

good.

MILES

(pointing)

Bathroom over there?

MAYA

Yeah.

MILES

You are such a loser. Come on!

MAYA

I was just getting some water. You

want some water?

MAYA

Nice.

MAYA (O.S.)

I should probably get going.

MAYA

You know how to get back to the

Windmill, right?

MILES

Got it.

MAYA

I had a good time tonight, Miles. I

really did.

MILES

Good. So did I.

MAYA

Okay. See you around.

MILES

Um... did you still want to read my

novel?

MAYA

Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

MAYA

Wow. Great.

MILES

Hope you like it. Feel free to stop

reading at any time. I'll take no

offense.

MAYA

Goodnight, Miles.

TUESDAY

JACK

Fucking chick is unbelievable. Un-be-

lieve-able!

JACK

Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty

nasty nasty.

MILES

Well, I'm glad you got it out of

your system. Congratulations. Mission

accomplished.

MILES

You didn't invite Stephanie to come

with us, did you?

JACK

Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's

off today, so she and I are going on

a hike.

MILES

We were supposed to play golf.

JACK

You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're

brand new -- gift from Christine's

dad.

(slapping some cash

on the dresser)

It's on me. Oh, say, by the way,

Stephanie and me were thinking we'd

all go to the Hitching Post tonight

and sit at one of Maya's tables, and

she'll bring us some great wines and

then we can all --

MILES

(sitting down)

Count me out.

JACK

Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last

night, huh? That's a shocker. You

mean getting drunk and calling

Victoria didn't put you in the mood?

You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's

getting real old real fast, dude.

JACK

Later.

MILES

Yeah, well, maybe you should check

your messages first.

JACK

Oh, boy.

MILES

(pointing at the room

phone)

She's been leaving messages here

too.

JACK

Yeah. Okay.

MILES

You should call her.

JACK

I will.

(heading out the door)

See ya!

MILES

Right now.

JACK

Okay! Jesus!

JACK

I've got no problem calling her.

JACK

(opening his phone)

Wait outside, will you?

STEPHANIE

That was fun last night.

MILES

Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a

wine collection. Very impressive.

STEPHANIE

Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this

morning. She said she had a good

time too. You should call her.

STEPHANIE

Where's Jack?

MILES

He had to make a phone call.

STEPHANIE

So what are you up to today, Miles?

MILES

Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't

know. Jack and I were supposed to go

golfing.

STEPHANIE

Huh.

MILES

Yeah, I reserved the tee time about

a month ago.

STEPHANIE

Oops. Sorry.

MILES

You golf?

STEPHANIE

Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid

game. I mean, at least, I could never

get into it. I tried it once.

MILES

Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about

it.

JACK

(hushed)

Hey Miles. Miles.

JACK

Do you have that other condom?

MILES

What'd Christine say?

JACK

Lucked out -- got voice mail.

Everything's cool.

SYNTHESIZED VOICE (O.S.)

No new messages.

JACK

Not now! Not now!

JACK

Hey, there you are.

MILES

Yep.

JACK

What're you drinking?

JACK

Any good?

JACK

(to the bartender)

Could I get a glass please?

(to Miles)

Stephanie took me out into the Pinot

fields today. It was awesome. I think

I finally got a handle on the whole

process, from the soil to the vine

to the -- what do you call it? --

selection and harvest. And the whole,

you know, big containers where they

mix it. We even ate Pinot grapes

right off the vine.

(the new expert)

Still a little sour but already

showing potential for great structure.

Stephanie really knows her shit,

Miles.

MILES

Where is Stephanie?

JACK

Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.

MILES

What the fuck are you doing?

JACK

What?

MILES

With this chick.

MILES

Does she know about Saturday?

JACK

Um... not exactly. But I've been

honest. I haven't told her I'm

available. And she knows this trip

up here is only for a few days.

Besides...

MILES

Besides what?

JACK

Well... I don't know, just... the

wedding.

MILES

What?

JACK

Well, I've been doing some thinking.

MILES

Oh, you've been thinking. And?

JACK

I may have to put the wedding on

hold is all.

JACK

I fully realize that making a change

like that might be tricky for certain

people to accept at first, but life

is short, Miles. I've got to be sure

I'm doing the right thing before

taking such a big step. And not just

for my sake. I'm thinking about

Christine's feelings too. I take

marriage very seriously -- always

have. That's why I've never done it

before. The day I get married, it's

going to be the real thing.

JACK

Being with Stephanie has opened my

eyes. She's not uptight or

controlling. She's just cool. Things

are so easy with her. Smells

different. Tastes different. Fucks

different. Fucks like an animal. I'm

telling you, I went deep last night,

Miles. Deep.

MILES

Deep.

JACK

Don't get all judgmental on me. This

is my deal. It's my life, and it's

my call.

JACK

I was hoping to get some understanding

from you. And I'm not getting it.

MILES

Understanding of what?

JACK

Like I might be in love with another

woman.

MILES

In love? Twenty-four hours with some

wine-pourer chick and you think you're

in love? And give up everything?

JACK

Look who's talking. You've been there.

MILES

Yes I have, and do I look like a

happy man? Was all that drama with

Brenda a happy thing for me to do?

Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my

life now?

JACK

This is totally different. I'm talking

about avoiding what you're talking

about. That's the distinction. I

have not made the commitment yet. I

am not married. I have not said the

words. In a few days, I might get

married, and if I do, then I won't

be doing stuff like this anymore.

Otherwise, what's the whole point of

getting married?

MILES

And what about Stephanie? She's a

woman -- with a kid. A single mom.

What do you think she's looking for?

Huh?

JACK

(interrupting)

Here's what I'm thinking. We move up

here, you and me, buy a vineyard.

You design your own wine; I'll handle

the business side. Then you get

inspired and write a new novel. As

for me, if an audition comes along,

hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.

MILES

You're crazy. You've gone crazy.

JACK

What do you care anyway? You don't

even like Christine.

MILES

What? Of course I like Christine.

JACK

You said she was shallow. Yeah, and

a nouveau riche.

MILES

That was three years ago after that

first party!

JACK

Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an

actor. All I have is my instinct.

(his hand on his chest)

My intuition -- that's all I have.

And you're asking me to go against

it. And that's just wrong.

STEPHANIE

Hi, guys. We should probably get

going.

MILES

Where?

CARYL

Stephanie's heard this a thousand

times, but if I'd done what I wanted

and I'd bought up in Santa Maria

when I had the chance, I would have

made a fortune when they put in that

outlet center and that Home Depot.

(a drag off her

cigarette, then to

Stephanie)

Your father knew it too, but he was

a fucking chickenshit. Always was.

JACK

Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph

and Siena get home safe, and then

maybe we'll hook up with you later,

okay?

MILES

(dispirited)

Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a

movie.

STEPHANIE

See you, Miles. You take care.

MILES

Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.

SIENA AND CARYL

Bye, Miles.

JACK

Call me on my cell if you go out.

MILES

Yeah.

MILES

And could I get a Barely Leqal?

MILES

NO, um, the new one.

GARY

How's it hanging, Miles?

MILES

You know me. I love it up here. How

about you?

GARY

Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a

busload of retired folks in on a

wine tour. Usually they're not too

rowdy, but tonight there was something

going on. Full moon or something.

What can I get you?

MILES

Highliner.

GARY

Glass or bottle?

MILES

(considers, then --)

Bottle.

GARY

You got it.

MILES

Say, is Maya working?

GARY

Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's

off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?

MILES

Oh, that's tasty.

GARY

You okay, Miles?

MILES

I'm good.

WEDNESDAY

JACK

Come on, dude. Let's go golfing! I

got us in at Alisal.

MILES

That's a public course.

(then --)

No Stephanie?

JACK

She's working. I need a break anyway.

She's getting a little clingy.

(magnanimous)

This is our day!

JACK

Crap.

JACK

Did you ever got ahold of Maya

yesterday?

MILES

Nope.

JACK

She likes you, man. Stephanie'll

tell you.

MILES

(preparing to swing)

Can you give me some room here?

JACK

(stepping back)

Oh yeah. Sure.

JACK

You know, in life you gotta strike

when the iron's hot.

MILES

Thanks, Jack.

JACK

Don't whiff it.

JACK

Nice shot.

MILES

You're an asshole.

JACK

What about your agent? Hear anything

yet?

MILES

Nope.

JACK

What do you think's going on?

MILES

Could be anything.

JACK

Been checking your messages?

MILES

Obsessively.

JACK

Huh.

MILES

They probably think my book is such

a piece of shit that it's not even

worthy of a response. I guess I'll

just have to learn how to kiss off

three years of my life.

JACK

But you don't know yet, so your

negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't

you say?

JACK

Or fuck those New York publishers.

Publish it yourself. I'll chip in.

Just get it out there, get it

reviewed, get it in libraries. Let

the public decide.

JACK

Don't come over the top. Stay still.

MILES

Shut up.

JACK

Just trying to be helpful.

(a moment later)

It's all about stillness, Miles.

Inner quiet.

MILES

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's

the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!

JACK

Why are you so hostile? I know you're

frustrated with your life right now,

but you can choose not to be so

hostile.

(holding out a cup of

wine)

Here.

MILES

What is it?

JACK

I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.

MILES

Huh. Let me see the label.

JACK

(whirling around)

What the fuck?

HUSBAND #1

(shouting, barely

audible)

Hurry it up, will you?

MILES

Fucker hit into us.

JACK

(yelling)

Hey, asshole! That's not cool!

MILES

Throw me his ball.

JACK

Nice shot.

JACK

Oh, this is going to be fun.

(jerking a driver

from his bag)

This is going to be fun.

JACK

Hit into us again, motherfuckers,

and I'll ass-rape all four of you!

JACK

Just don't give up on Maya. Cool

smart chicks like that --they like

persistence.

MILES

I don't want to talk about it.

JACK

All I know is she's beautiful. Lots

of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not

going to feel good about this trip

until you guys hook up. Don't you

just want to feel that cozy little

box grip down on your Johnson?

GOLFER

Hey, you mind keeping it down, buddy?

JACK

Is it the money thing?

MILES

Is what the money thing?

JACK

With Maya.

MILES

Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman

finds out how I live, that I'm not a

published author, that I'm a liar

essentially, then yeah, any interest

is gonna evaporate real quick. If

you don't have money at my age, you're

not even in the game. You're just a

pasture animal waiting for the

abattoir.

JACK

Is an abattoir like a... like a...

what is that?

MILES

Slaughterhouse.

JACK

Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to

get the good news this week about

your book. I know you are. I can

feel it.

JACK

It's Steph.

(picking up)

Hey, baby. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yesssss. I

mean I would, but let me see. Hey,

Miles... Oh fuck it, we're going.

We'll be right there. Me too.

JACK

We're on.

MILES

What's happening?

JACK

We're going to have some fun. Remember

fun? We're going to have some of it.

Okay?

MILES

What exactly are we going to do?

JACK

I said okay?

MILES

You have to tell me --

JACK

I SAID OKAY?

MILES

Okay.

BIG FUN MUSIC BEGINS OVER:

MAYA

Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the

restaurant last night looking for

me.

MILES

Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped

by for a drink. Didn't see you.

MAYA

I had class.

MILES

Well, nice to see you now.

MAYA

You too.

JACK

You ever actually read any of this

guy's books?

MILES

He wrote a great one on Burgundy,

and I used to get his newsletter,

but then there were doubts about

whether he does all his own tasting.

Plus a couple of times he declared

certain years vintages of the century,

and they turned out to be turkeys.

Fucker never retracted.

JACK

Huh.

MUSIC ENDS AND SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

THURSDAY

MAYA

You guys should stop by the restaurant

for lunch today.

MILES

Great. What's the latest we can get

there?

MAYA

About two-thirty.

MILES

Okay.

MAYA

(noticing)

Did you hear about this Bordeaux

tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara

Saturday night? It's a little pricey,

but if you wanted to go, I'd be into

it. Why don't you stay through the

weekend?

MILES

No, we've got to get back Friday for

the rehearsal dinner.

MAYA

What rehearsal dinner?

MAYA

Who's getting married?

MAYA

Were you ever going to say anything?

MILES

Of course I was. I mean, just now I

could have made up some story, but I

didn't. I told you the truth.

MILES

Maya.

MAYA

(jerking away)

Don't touch me. Just take me home.

MILES

I've told him. I've told him over

and over, but he's out of control.

MAYA

Do you know what he's been saying to

her?

MILES

He's an actor, so it can't be good.

MAYA

Oh, just that he loves her. That

she's the only woman who has ever

really rocked his world. How he adores

Siena. How he wants to move up here

and get a place with the two of them

and commute when he has to.

MILES

I'm sure he believed every word.

MILES

Please believe me. I was even on the

verge of telling you last night,

but...

MAYA

But you wanted to fuck me first.

MILES

Oh, Maya. No.

MAYA

Yeah.

MAYA

You know, I just spent three years

trying to extricate myself from a

relationship that turned out to be

full of deception. And I've been

doing just fine.

MILES

And I haven't been with anyone since

my divorce. This has been a big deal

for me, Maya -- hanging out with

you, and last night. I really like

you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm

just his... his freshman roommate

from San Diego State.

MAYA

Could I have my paper, please?

JACK

Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my

boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is

yo' daddy?

MILES

Put me down, Jack.

MILES

I said put me down. Jack!

JACK

I'm so proud of you! Let me love

you!

JACK

So tell me everything. Details. I

like details.

MILES

No.

JACK

What?

MILES

It's private.

JACK

You're kidding, right? Tell me what

happened, you fucker, or I'll tie

your dick in a knot.

MILES

Let's leave it alone.

JACK

You didn't get any, did you?

(off Miles's silence)

You're a homo.

MILES

Just stop, okay? Make something up,

and that's what happened. Whatever

you want. Write my confession, and

I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me

all the time! I can't take it! You're

an infant! This is all a big party

for you, but not for me! This is

serious. And you -- Just... leave me

alone, okay? You're fucking me up.

JACK

Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.

JACK

Did you have trouble performing?

Yeah, that's...

MILES

Shut up! Shut up, Jack!

MILES

Don't answer it.

MILES

I'm telling you, don't.

JACK

Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing?

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

(mouthing)

Christine.

JACK

Listen, honey. Let me call you back.

Miles and I are in the middle of

something. No, it's nothing serious --

Miles is just having one of his freak-

outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call

you right back.

MILES

This whole week has gone sour. It

isn't turning out like it was supposed

to.

(deadly serious)

I want to go home.

JACK

Who's being selfish now? I'm the one

getting married. I thought this week

was supposed to be about me.

MILES

We gotta slow down.

(closing his eyes)

I'm so tired. Let's just get out of

here.

JACK

I know what you need.

SALES ASSOCIATE

There you go.

MILES

Do you like them?

JACK

Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're

really sporty.

MILES

Are they too sporty?

JACK

Feel better?

JACK

(noticing something)

Oh here, wait a second. I want to

run in here real quick.

JACK

(over his shoulder)

I want to get something for Siena.

JACK

How about this one? We didn't hit

this one.

MILES

Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.

JACK

You ever actually been in there,

Miles?

MILES

I don't have to.

JACK

(turning the wheel)

I say we check it out. You never

know.

MILES

Tastes like the back of a fucking LA

schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem,

hoping for some semblance of

concentration, crushed it up with

leaves and mice, wound up with this

rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash

bullshit. Fucking Raid.

JACK

I don't know. Tastes okay to me.

(looking at the tasting

sheet)

Hey, they got a reserve pinot.

MILES

Let me use your phone.

JACK

(handing it over)

What's up?

MILES

I can't take it anymore. I've got to

call Evelyn.

ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)

Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.

MILES

Hi, it's Miles.

ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)

Oh, hi, Miles. Let me see if I can

get her.

(a moment later)

You're in luck. I'll put you through.

EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)

Miles.

MILES

Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite

client.

EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)

How's the trip?

MILES

Good, good. Drinking some good wines

and kicking back, you know. So what's

happening? Still no word?

EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)

Actually there is word. I spoke to

Keith Kurtzman this morning.

MILES

And?

EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)

And... they're passing. Conundrum's

passing. He said they really liked

it. They really wanted to do it, but

they just couldn't figure out how to

market it. He said it was a tough

call.

MILES

Huh.

EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)

I'm sorry, Miles.

(off his silence)

So I don't know where that leaves

us. I'm not sure how much more mileage

I can get out of continuing to submit

it. I think it's one of those

unfortunate cases in the business

right now -- a fabulous book with no

home. The whole industry's gotten

gutless. It's not about the quality

of the books. It's about the

marketing.

EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)

Are you there? Miles?

MILES

Yeah, I'm here.

EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)

I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could.

You've been a real trooper.

(loudly, to her

assistant)

Tell him I'll call back.

MILES

So I guess that's it.

EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)

You're a wonderful writer, Miles.

Don't be discouraged.

EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)

Just hang in there, and who knows?

After you get something else

published, we can revisit this one.

And next time we can try a different

title.

MILES

Hit me again.

MILES

Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for

it.

POURER

This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.

MILES

Just give me a full goddamn pour.

POURER

Sir, what are you doing?

MILES

I told you I need a drink.

POURER

Then buy a bottle and go outside.

POURER

Put the glass down.

POURER

You're going to have to leave, sir.

JACK

(to the horrified

onlookers)

It's all right. His mother just died.

JACK

Just write another one. You have

lots of ideas, right?

MILES

No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.

I'm a middle-school English teacher.

I'm going to spend the rest of my

life grading essays and reading the

works of others. It's okay. I like

books. The world doesn't give a shit

what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.

(a dark laugh)

I'm so insignificant, I can't even

kill myself.

JACK

What's that supposed to mean?

MILES

You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf,

Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't

kill yourself before you've even

been published.

JACK

What about that guy who wrote

Confederacy of Dunces? He committed

suicide before he got published, and

look how famous he is.

MILES

Thanks.

JACK

Don't give up. You're going to make

it.

MILES

Half my life is over, and I have

nothing to show for it. I'm a

thumbprint on the window of a

skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement

on a tissue surging out to sea with

a million tons of raw sewage.

JACK

See? Right there. Just what you just

said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint

on a skyscraper. I couldn't write

that.

MILES

Neither could I. I think it's

Bukowski.

JACK

(lighting up)

Oh, look. There's Steph!

JACK

(calling out)

Hey, baby.

JACK

Look what I got for our favorite

girl.

STEPHANIE

YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

MILES

Stephanie! Stop!

STEPHANIE

You fucking bastard! Lying piece of

shit! You're getting married on

Saturday? What was all that shit you

said to me?

JACK

I can explain.

STEPHANIE

You said you loved me! You fuck! I

hope you die!

STEPHANIE

Fuckface!

(to Miles)

You too!

MILES

Aren't you glad you didn't move up

here and marry her?

JACK

Don't need a lecture. You fucking

told Maya, didn't you?

MILES

No, I did not. Must have been Gary

at the Hitching Post. I think we

mentioned it to him the first night.

JACK

You told him. I'm fucking hurting

here.

MILES

Keep it elevated.

MAYA (ON THE PHONE)

Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.

MILES

It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if

you even care, but I had to call and

tell you again how much I enjoyed

our time together and how sorry I am

things turned out the way they did.

I think you're great, Maya -- always

have. From the first time you waited

on me.

(bracing himself)

And while I'm at it, I guess you

should know that my book is not

getting published. I thought this

one had a chance, but I was wrong.

Again. Don't bother reading it --

you've got better things to do. So

you see I'm not much of a writer.

I'm not anything really. The only

real talent I seem to have is for

disappointing people and now you

know that firsthand. We're leaving

in the morning, and I want you to

know that I take with me wonderful

memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really

sorry.

MILES

Well?

JACK

I'm going to need an operation. Maybe

a couple of them. They have to wait

for it it to heal first. Then they

break it again.

MILES

Good thing you have a voice-over

career.

JACK

Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue

her ass. Only reason I won't is to

protect Christine.

MILES

That's thoughtful.

JACK

(disgusted)

Yeah.

JACK

I hate this place.

MILES

Take a couple of these, and you'll

learn to love it.

MILES

Two for you. And two for me.

JACK

So how did Stephanie know it was

Saturday? We didn't get into that

with Gary.

MILES

Huh. Let me think.

JACK

You sure you didn't say anything to

Maya?

MILES

Sure I'm sure. And just what are you

implying? I'm really pissed off at

you about all this, if you want to

know the truth. What's Maya going to

think of me now just for associating

with you? You're the one who's

sabotaging me, not the other way

around, pal. Not by a longshot.

JACK

I don't know. Just seems fishy.

JACK

What's it look like to you?

MILES

Looks like you were in a bad car

accident.

JACK

I'm hungry.

JACK

You know what I'm thinking?

MILES

What's that?

JACK

I'm thinking it's time to settle

down. One woman. One house. You know.

It's time.

MILES

Uh-huh.

JACK

Mm. Mm.

WAITRESS

And here're your Handi-wipes.

JACK

Oh, so that's what those are? For a

second there I thought you guys were

promoting safe sex.

WAITRESS

I'll be right back with more corn

bread.

JACK

I bet you that chick is two tons of

fun. You know, the grateful type.

MILES

I don't know. I wouldn't know.

JACK

Nice technique there...

(checking her name

tag)

...Cammi.

CAMMI

It's all in the wrist.

(a moment later)

You know, you look really familiar.

You from around here? Where'd you go

to high school?

JACK

No, we're from San Diego. Why?

CAMMI

I don't know. You just seem really

familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy

your meals.

JACK

Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek

Sommersby?

CAMMI

Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean

from "One Life to Live"?

JACK

You have to imagine him with a bandage

and shorter hair.

CAMMI

No. Way. No way!

CAMMI

Oh, my God!

MILES

Could you tell me where the bathroom

is?

CAMMI

(her eyes barely

leaving Jack)

Uh, sure, it's right over there,

right past the buffalo.

JACK

She gets off in an hour, so I think

I'm just going to have a drink and

then... make sure she gets home safe.

MILES

You're joking, right?

(seeing that he isn't)

What are you doing? Un-fucking-

believeable. Can we just go back to

the hotel and hang out and get up

early and play nine holes before we

head home?

JACK

Look, Miles. I know you're my friend

and you care about me. And I know

you disapprove. I respect that. But

there are some things I have to do

that you don't understand. You

understand wine and literature and

movies, but you don't understand my

plight. And that's okay.

FADE TO BLACK:

FRIDAY

JACK

Jesus fucking Christ, it's freezing.

JACK

Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin? My

nose.

JACK

Fucking chick's married.

MILES

What?

JACK

Her husband works a night shift or

something, and he comes home, and

I'm on the floor with my cock in his

wife's ass.

MILES

Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked

all the way back from Solvang?

JACK

Ran. Twisted my ankle too.

MILES

That's five clicks, Jackson.

JACK

Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one

point I had to cut through an ostrich

farm. Fuckers are mean.

JACK

We gotta go back.

MILES

What?

JACK

I left my wallet. My credit cards,

cash, fucking ID, everything. We

gotta go back.

MILES

Big deal. We'll call right now and

cancel your cards.

JACK

You don't understand. The wedding

bands. The wedding bands are in my

wallet.

MILES

Okay, so they were in your wallet,

and you left your wallet somewhere.

Some bar. Christine'll understand.

JACK

No. She ordered them special. Took

her forever to find them. They've

got this design on them with dolphins

and our names engraved in Sanskrit.

We've got to go back. Christine'll

fucking crucify me.

MILES

No way. No way.

JACK

(a pitiful whine)

Please, Miles, please.

MILES

Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at

a bar. Happens every day.

JACK

No, we've got to get my wallet! Those

rings are irreplaceable! We've got

to get them, Miles! I fucked up! I

know I fucked up, okay? I fucked up.

You gotta help me. You gotta help

me. Pleeeease!

JACK

Oh, God, please... Oh God. I know

I'm bad. I know I did a bad thing.

Help me, Miles. Just this one thing,

this one last thing. I can't lose

Christine. I can't. I'm nothing

without her. Please, Miles, please...

uuuuu... uuuuuu.... uuuuuuu......

MILES

She tell you she was married?

JACK

Yeah.

MILES

So what the fuck were you thinking?

JACK

Wasn't supposed to be back till six.

Fucker rolls in at five.

MILES

Cutting it a little close, don't you

think?

(off Jack's silence)

So how was she? Compared to Stephanie,

say.

JACK

Horny as shit. Flopping around like

a landed trout.

JACK

Yeah, this is the block. Just keep

going...

(spotting an AMC Pacer)

Yeah! This is it. There's her car.

MILES

So what's the plan?

JACK

The plan is... you go.

MILES

Me?

JACK

My ankle. Just go explain the

situation.

MILES

(sarcastic, clearing

his throat)

Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend

was the one balling your wife a couple

hours ago, and he seems to have left

his wallet behind, and we were

wondering...

JACK

Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like

that.

JACK

Fuck you. I'll get it myself.

MILES

(grabbing Jack's shirt)

Hold on.

MAN

You don't think I fuck you, bitch?

I'll fuck you.

CAMMI

I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.

MAN

You picked him up and you fucked

him, didn't you, bitch?

CAMMI

I picked him up and I fucked him.

I'm a bad girl.

MAN

And you liked fucking him, didn't

you, you fat little whore?

CAMMI

I liked it when you caught me fucking

him.

MAN (O.S.)

The fuck was that?

CAMMI (O.S.)

The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!

CAMMI (O.S.)

Get him!

MILES

Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn

door!

MAN

You motherfuckers! I'll kill you!

I'll kill you motherfuckers!

JACK

You did it! You fucking did it!

MAID

Housekeeping.

MILES

Hey, Jack. Jack.

JACK

Hrnrnrn?

MILES

That was quite a day yesterday.

JACK

Yep. Quite a day.

MILES

Quite a week.

JACK

Want me to drive?

MILES

No, I'm okay.

JACK

Hey, why don't you invite Maya to

the wedding?

MILES

Somehow I don't think inviting Maya

to your wedding is the right move.

In fact, after your bullshit, it's

going to be hard for me to even go

to the Hitching Post again.

JACK

You're so negative.

JACK

Come on, let me drive.

MILES

I'm fine. You rest.

JACK

I feel like driving.

MILES

What's wrong?

JACK

Nothing. Buckle up, okay?

MILES

What the fuck!

JACK

(pointing at his face)

You said it looked like a car

accident.

MILES

What the fuck!

JACK

I'll pay for it.

MILES

Look at this!

JACK

I don't know. Doesn't look like

anybody got hurt in this one.

MILES

Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.

JACK

You need a new car anyway.

JACK

I said I'd pay for it.

MILES

You broke some.

JACK

Whatever. Sorry.

MILES

No, not whatever. You fucking

derelict.

JACK

You ready?

MILES

Oh, fuck!

JACK

It's okay. I've got Triple A.

MILES

Well. That about does it.

JACK

Why don't you come in?

MILES

Uh-uh. You're on your own.

JACK

So I'll see you at the rehearsal.

MILES

Yeah.

JACK

Love you, man.

MILES

Back at you.

JACK

Hey, don't pull away till they see

the car.

MILES

(over his shoulder)

Yeah.

(turning around)

Hey, why wasn't I injured?

JACK

(big smile)

You were wearing your belt.

VICTORIA (O.S.)

Hey, Miles.

MILES

Hi, Vicki.

(taking her in)

You look beautiful.

VICTORIA

Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my

husband.

KEN

How are you?

MILES

Hi. How you doing? You're a lucky

guy.

KEN

Thanks.

(to Victoria)

I'll wait for you at the car.

(to Miles)

Nice to meet you, Miles.

MILES

Ken.

MILES

That was big of him.

VICTORIA

Yeah, he's good that way. Very

considerate.

MILES

That's great.

VICTORIA

So how're you doing?

MILES

Since the last time we spoke? I don't

know. Could be better. Could be worse.

VICTORIA

So what's happening with your book?

MILES

Universally rejected. Strike three.

VICTORIA

Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are

you going to do?

MILES

Back to the drawing board, I guess.

Or not. So... you're married.

Congratulations. You look happy.

VICTORIA

I am.

MILES

Seems like everyone's getting married.

A year ago it was all divorces. Now

it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.

VICTORIA

I guess.

MILES

(shifting gears)

Well, let's go have some champagne,

shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.

VICTORIA

Not me. I'm not drinking.

MILES

You quit drinking?

VICTORIA

I'm pregnant.

MILES

(hit in the solar

plexus)

Oh. Huh. Well...

(rallying)

Congratulations again, Vicki. That's

wonderful news.

VICTORIA

(going to the car)

See you over there, Miles.

MILES

Yeah.

14-YEAR-OLD BOY (O.S.)

"The marrow of his bone," I repeated

aimlessly. This at least penetrated

my mind. Phineas had died from the

marrow of his bone flowing down his

blood stream to his heart.

FIVE WEEKS LATER

14-YEAR-OLD BOY

I did not cry then or ever about

Finny. I did not cry even when I

stood watching him being lowered

into his family's straight-laced

burial ground outside of Boston. I

could not escape a feeling that this

was my own funeral, and you do not

cry in that case.

14-YEAR-OLD BOY

Do you want me to keep reading the

next chapter, Mr. Raymond?

MILES

(as though coming to)

Hrnrnrn? No, we'll pick up there on

Monday.

ANSWERING MACHINE

One new message.

MAYA'S VOICE

Hello, Miles. It's Maya.

MAYA'S VOICE

Thanks for your letter. I would have

called you sooner, but I think I've

needed some time to think about

everything that happened and what

you wrote to me. Another reason I

didn't call sooner is that I wanted

to finish your book, which I finally

did last night.

MAYA'S VOICE

I think it's really lovely, Miles.

You're so good with words. Who cares

if it's not getting published? There

are so many beautiful and painful

things about it. Did you really go

through all that? It must have been

awfully hard. And the sister character --

Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to

say I was really confused by the

ending. Did the father finally commit

suicide, or what? It's driving me

crazy. And the title.

MAYA'S VOICE

Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy

here lately. But I like winter. So

listen, if you ever do decide to

come up here again, you should let

me know. I would say stop by the

Hitching Post, but to tell you the

truth I'm not sure how much longer

I'm going to be working there. I'm

going to graduate soon so I'll

probably relocate. We'll see.

MAYA'S VOICE

Anyway, like I said, I really loved

your novel. Don't give up, Miles.

Keep writing. You're really good.

Hope you're well. Bye.

THE END
