SAAVIK'S VOICE

Captain's log. Stardate 8130.3,

Starship Enterprise on training

mission to Gamma Hydra. Section 14,

coordinates 22/87/4. Approaching

Neutral Zone, all systems

functioning.

SULU

Leaving Section Fourteen for

Section Fifteen.

SAAVIK

Project parabolic course to

avoid entering Neutral Zone.

SULU

Aye, Captain.

UHURA

(suddenly)

Captain... I'm getting something

on the distress channel. Minimal

signal... But something...

SAAVIK

Can you amplify?

UHURA

I'm trying...

SULU

Course change projected.

UHURA

It's an emergency distress call!

SAAVIK

On speakers!

VOICE

(filtered, breaking up)

Imperative! Imperative! This is

the Kobayashi Maru -- nineteen

periods out of Altair Six. We

have struck a gravitic mine and

have lost all power... Our hull

is...

(breaks up, static)

... and many casualties.

UHURA

This is the Starship Enterprise.

Your message is breaking up. Give

your coordinates. Repeat --

VOICE

Enterprise, our position is Gamma

Hydra, Section Ten...

SAAVIK

In the neutral zone.

VOICE

Hull penetrated, life support

systems failing. Can you assist

us, Enterprise? Can you...

SAAVIK

Data on Kobayashi Maru! Tactical!

COMPUTER VOICE

Subject vessel is third class

neutronic fuel carrier, crew of

eighty-one, three hundred passengers.

SAAVIK

Damn.

(then)

Mr. Sulu, plot an intercept course.

SULU

May I remind the Captain that if a

Starship enters the zone --

SAAVIK

I'm aware of my responsibilities,

Mister.

SULU

(with a nod)

... Now entering the Neutral

Zone...

COMPUTER VOICE

Warning. We have entered the

Neutral Zone... Warning...

SULU

Estimating two minutes to intercept.

SAAVIK

Stand by transporter room, ready

to beam survivors, aboard.

UHURA

Captain, I've lost their signal!

COMPUTER VOICE

Alert. Sensors indicate three

Klingon Cruisers, bearing 316,

mark 4, closing fast.

SAAVIK

Visual!

SAAVIK

(continuing)

Battle stations! Activate shields!

SULU

Shields activated!

SAAVIK

Inform the Klingons we are on a

rescue mission...

UHURA

They're jamming all frequencies,

Captain --

COMPUTER VOICE

Klingons on attack course and closing.

SAAVIK

We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu,

get us out of here.

SULU

I'll try, Captain.

COMPUTER VOICE

Klingon cruisers approaching,

bearing 090, mark 20.

SAAVIK

Visual!

SAAVIK

(continuing)

Evasive action!

SAAVIK

(continuing)

Engineering! damage report!

SCOTTY'S VOICE

(INTERCOM)

Main energizer hit, Captain!

SAAVIK

Engage auxiliary power. Prepare

to return fire!

A CADET

Shields collapsing, Captain!

SCOTTY'S VOICE

(FILTERED)

Captain, we're losing auxiliary

power!

SAAVIK

Fire all phasers...!

SPOCK

No power to the weapons system,

sir.

SCOTTY'S VOICE

(FILTERED)

Captain, it's no use. We're

dead in space.

SAAVIK

Activate escape pods. Send out the

Log Buoy... All hands abandon ship.

Repeat -- all hands --

KIRK'S VOICE

(FILTERED)

All right, open her up.

SAAVIK

Any suggestions, Admiral?

KIRK

Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons

do not take prisoners.

(to Spock)

Captain.

SPOCK

Trainees to the briefing room.

KIRK

Physician, heal thyself.

BONES

That's all you have to say?

KIRK

I'm not a drama critic.

KIRK

(continuing)

Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going

to stay with the sinking ship?

SAAVIK

Permission to speak candidly, sir?

KIRK

Very well.

SAAVIK

(fights emotion)

I don't believe this was a fair

test of my command capabilities.

KIRK

And why not?

SAAVIK

Because... there was no way to win.

KIRK

A no-win situation is a possibility

every commander may face. Has that

never occurred to you?

SAAVIK

... No, sir. It has not.

KIRK

How we deal with death is at least

as important as how we deal with

life, wouldn't you say?

SAAVIK

(falters)

As I indicated, Admiral, that

thought had not occurred to me.

KIRK

Then you have something new to think

about. Carry on.

BONES

Wouldn't it be easier to put

an experienced crew back on the

ship?

KIRK

They'll learn. Galloping about the

cosmos is a game for the young,

doctor.

UHURA

(offended)

What is that supposed to mean?

5   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE SIMULATOR ROOM - DAY               5

KIRK

(dry)

Aren't you dead?

KIRK

(continuing)

I assume you are loitering here

to learn what efficiency rating

I plan to give your cadets.

SPOCK

I am understandably curious.

KIRK

They destroyed the simulator room

and you with it.

SPOCK

The

Kobayshi Maru

scenario

frequently wreaks havoc with

students and equipment.

(dry)

As I recall you took the test

three times yourself. Your final

solution was, shall we say, unique?

KIRK

(solemn)

It had the virtue of never having

been tried.

SPOCK

Yours was not a solution which

would have occurred to a Vulcan

mentality.

KIRK

So you said at the time. Speaking

of which, your protg's first

rare -- a trifle emotional --

SPOCK

She's half Romulan, Jim. The

admixture makes her more volatile

than -- me, for example.

KIRK

Than you. Yes, I see that. By

the way, thank you for this.

SPOCK

I know of your fondness for antiques.

KIRK

(reads)

'It was the best of times, it was

the worst of times...' Message,

Spock?

SPOCK

None of which I am consciously

aware -- except, of course, happy

birthday -- surely the best of times.

KIRK

Hrummm... and where are you off

to, now?

SPOCK

The Enterprise. I must check in

before your inspection. And you?

KIRK

(shortly)

Home.

SPOCK

Something oppresses you.

KIRK

Something.

CHEKOV'S VOICE

Starship log, Stardate 8130.4.

This report classified MOST SECRET.

Log Entry by Commander Pavel Chekov,

Duty Officer. Starship USS Reliant

on orbital approach with Ceti Alpha

VI in connection with project code

name GENESIS. We are continuing

our search for a lifeless planet

which will serve as a suitable test

site for the Genesis Experiments.

This is the 16th planet we have

visited, so far, no success.

TERRELL

Standard orbit, Mr. Beach.

BEACH

Standard orbit, sir.

TERRELL

Any change in surface scan?

BEACH

Negative. Limited atmosphere,

dominated by craylon gas, sand and

high velocity winds. Incapable

of supporting life forms.

Ceti Alpha

.

CHEKOV

Does it have to be

completely

lifeless?

TERRELL

Don't tell me you've got something.

CHEKOV

(points)

We've picked up a minor energy flux

reading on one dyno scanner.

TERRELL

Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the

scanner's out of adjustment --

CHEKOV

I suppose it

could

be a particle

of preanimate matter caught in the

matrix...

TERRELL

All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to

Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something

we can transplant.

CHEKOV

You know what she'll say...

don't know --

9   INT. SPACE STATION - CAROL'S LAB                             9

TERRELL

It might only be a particle of

preanimate matter...

CAROL

Then again it might not. You

boys have to be clear on this:

there can't be so much as a

microbe or the show's off.

(she thinks)

Why don't you have a look? If it

IS something that can be moved...

TERRELL

(eager)

You bet, doctor. We're on our way!

DAVID

How can you let them pull that

stuff on you? They're just lazy.

CAROL

And bored. I know. But maybe it

IS something they can...

DAVID

Come on, Mother, that's just the

military mentality. Never put off

tomorrow what you can put off today.

If there's one atom of life...

CAROL

I know, I know...

DAVID

Well, don't have kittens.

Genesis is going to work. They'll

remember  you in a wreath with

Newton, Einstein, Surak...

CAROL

(mock outrage)

Thanks a lot. No respect from my

offspring --

DAVID

Par for the course... you teaming

up with me for bridge after dinner?

CAROL

Maybe...

DAVID

Every time we have dealings with

Starfleet, I get nervous.

(shrugs)

We're dealing with something

that COULD be perverted into

a dreadful weapon. Remember that

overgrown boy scout you used to

hang out with? That's exactly

the --

CAROL

Listen, kiddo, Jim Kirk was many

things, but he was never a Boy

Scout...

11   INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT, TERRA - NIGHT                        11

KIRK

Come.

KIRK

(continuing)

Bless me, doctor; and what beams

you into this neck of the woods?

BONES

'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.'

Happy Birthday...

KIRK

Romulan Ale! Bones, you know

this stuff is illegal --

BONES

(broad)

I only use it for medicinal

purposes. Don't be a pring...

KIRK

(reading the label

with difficulty)

Twenty-two, eighty-three...

BONES

Takes the stuff a while to

ferment. Gimme.

BONES

(continuing)

Now open the other one.

KIRK

I'm almost afraid to. What did

you bring me, contraband Klingon --

BONES

More antiques for your collection

-- Cheers!

KIRK

Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.

BONES

Four hundred years old. You don't

find many with the lens still

intact.

KIRK

Uh -- what are they?

BONES

For your eyes. For most patients

of your age, I generally administer

Retlax Five to restore flexibility

of the lens.

KIRK

But I'm allergic to Retlax.

BONES

Exactly. Happy birthday.

BONES

(continuing)

Slide them down your nose. Now look

at me over the top. And you read

printed matter through the bottom.

KIRK

(reacts)

Amazing! I don't know what to say --

BONES

Say thank you.

KIRK

Thank you.

BONES

Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the

matter? Other people have birthdays.

Why're we treating yours like a funeral?

KIRK

Bones, I don't want to be lectured.

BONES

What DO you want? Damn it, why

isn't there a girl here? You know

this has nothing to do with age.

This is about you flying a goddamn

computer console when you wanna be

out hopping Galaxies.

KIRK

Spare me your notions of poetry,

please. We all have our assigned

duties and...

BONES

Bull. You're hiding -- hiding

behind the rules and regulations --

KIRK

And who am I hiding from?

BONES

From yourself, Admiral.

KIRK

Don't mince words, Bones; tell

me what you really think.

BONES

(mild take)

I'm your doctor and I'm your friend,

Jim. Get back your command. Get it

back before you really do grow old.

Before you turn into part of this

collection.

KHAN

(finally)

I don't know you. But you. I never

forget a face. Mister Chekov,

isn't it?

(wonderingly)

I never thought to see your face

again.

TERRELL

Chekov, who is this man?

CHEKOV

A criminal, Captain -- a product of

the late 20th Century genetic

engineering --

TERRELL

What do you want with us? I demand --

KHAN

(mild)

You are in a position to demand

nothing, sir. I, on the other hand,

am in a position to grant nothing.

What you see is all that remains of

the ship's company and the crew of the

Botany Bay

, marooned here fifteen

years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

TERRELL

Listen to me -- you men and women --

KHAN

Save your strength, Captain, these

people have sworn to live and die at

my command two hundred years before

you were born. Do you mean he...

(i.e. Chekov)

... never told you the tale?

To amuse you, Captain? Never told

you how the

Enterprise

picked up the

Botany Bay

, lost in space from the

year 1996, myself and the ship's

company in cryogenic freeze?

TERRELL

I've never even met Admiral Kirk --

KHAN

Admiral? He didn't tell you how

Admiral

Kirk sent seventy of us into

exile on this barren sand heap with

only the contents of these cargo bays

to sustain us?

CHEKOV

You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was

life, a fair chance to --

KHAN

This is Ceti Alpha V

! Ceti Alpha VI

exploded six months after we were

left here. The shock shifted the

orbit of

this

planet and everything

was laid waste.

Admiral

Kirk never

bothered to check on our progress.

It was only the fact of my genetically

engineered intellect that enabled us

to survive! On earth, two hundred

years ago, I was a prince, with power

over millions -- now, like Prometheus

I have been left by Admiral Kirk to

digest my own entrails.

CHEKOV

Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid

his hospitality by trying to steal his

ship and murder him.

KHAN

(moves closer)

And I'll wager he never told you

about his shipmate, the beautiful

and courageous Lieutenant McGiver,

who gave up everything to join me

in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how

Admiral Kirk

requited her devotion --

She's dead as earth!

KHAN

(continuing)

A plague upon you all.

KHAN

(continuing)

You didn't expect to find me.

You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.

Why are you here?

KHAN

(continuing)

Why?

KHAN

(continuing)

No matter.

KHAN

(continuing)

You will soon tell me willingly

enough.

KHAN

(continuing)

Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's

only remaining indigenous life form;

what do you think? They've killed

twenty of my people, including my

beloved wife. Oh, not all at once

and not instantly, to be sure. Their

young enter through the ears and wrap

themselves around the cerebral cortex.

This has the effect of rendering the

victim

extremely

susceptible to

suggestion. Later, as they grow,

follows madness, paralysis -- and

death. These are pets, of course --

not

quite

domesticated.

CHEKOV

Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk

was only doing his duty! You --

26   CLOSE UP - KHAN - CAMERA IN                                 26

KHAN

There is some pain at first, I am

told, and then the effects are quite

benign -- until the end. That was

what I learned from watching my wife.

KHAN

(continuing)

That's better! Now: tell me why

you are here -- and tell me where I

may find James Kirk.

Yes, SIR.

Very good, Mr. Spock.

SAAVIK

He's not what I expected, Sir.

SPOCK

What did you expect, Lieutenant?

SAAVIK

(uncertain)

He's very human.

SPOCK

We can't all be perfect, Saavik.

You must control your prejudices

and remember that as a Vulcan as

well as a Romulan you are forever

a stranger in an alien land.

Around you are humans, and as a

member of the Starfleet you are

unlikely ever to escape their

presence or their influence.

You must learn to tolerance in addition

to all else I have taught you.

Tolerance is logical.

Oh do you? Have you any idea,

I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on

the Comm, telling me his troubles?

Have you any idea the ribbing I've

had to endure in the officers' mess

to the effect that the Enterprise

is a flying death trap?

Oh, no, sir! This is the finest

engine room in the whole Star --

KHAN

It's not much different from

Enterprise.

(beat)

When I was a guest aboard her some

years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed

me to memorize her technical manuals.

And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review:

You say you have no details of

Project 'Genesis' ?

CHEKOV

Beyond what I told you, sir, it is

classified information.

KHAN

Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have

access to such information?

CHEKOV

I would think so, sir. He's on the

Fleet General Staff.

KHAN

Then to whom do you report directly

regarding Genesis?

CHEKOV

To Doctor Marcus, the civilian

director of the experiments on Space

Laboratory Regula I.

KHAN

(thinks)

I see. Helmsman?

HELMSMAN

Aye, sir.

JOACHIM

May I speak? We're all with you,

sir, but consider: we are free,

we have a ship and the means to

go where we will. We have

escaped permanent exile on Ceti

Alpha V. You have proved your

superior intellect and defeated

the plans of Admiral Kirk.

You do not need to defeat him

again.

KHAN

He tasks me -- and I'll have him. I'll

chase him round the moons of Nibia

and round the Antares maelstrom and

round perdition's flames before I give

him up.

(as no one speaks)

Commander, we are receiving. This

is Regula I. Go ahead.

CHEKOV

Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route

to you and should be there in three

CAROL

En route? Why? We weren't expecting

you for another three months. Has

something happened?

All went well. Nothing has happened.

We have received new orders. Upon our

arrival at Regula I, all materials of

Project Genesis will be transferred to

this ship for immediate testing at

CAROL

(back to console)

Commander Chekov, this is completely

irregular. Who gave the order you

are quoting? Who gave the order?

CHEKOV

The order comes from Starfleet

command, Dr. Marcus, direct from

the General Staff.

CAROL

But Genesis is a civilian project,

under my control --

CHEKOV

I have my orders.

DAVID

Pin him down, mother! Who gave the

orders!?

CHEKOV

The orders come from Admiral James

T. Kirk.

DAVID

I knew it! I knew it! All along

hands on this --

CAROL

This is completely improper,

Commander Chekov. I have no

intention of allowing Reliant or

any other unauthorized personnel

access to our work or materials.

(as they subside)

This has to be some sort of mistake.

DAVID

Mistake? We're all alone here.

They waited until everyone was on

supposed to be at our disposal, not

vice-versa.

MADISON

It seems clear that Starfleet never

intended that --

CAROL

I know, but --

DAVID

I've tried to warn you. Scientists

are always pawns of the military --

CAROL

Starfleet has kept the peace for

a hundred years, I cannot and

will not subscribe to your

interpretation of this event.

You may be right, Doctor, but what

about Reliant? She's on her way.

We've got a problem.

KIRK

(continuing)

Something may be wrong at Regula

I. We've been ordered to investigate.

SPOCK

Regula I is a scientific research

laboratory, if memory serves...

KIRK

I told Starfleet all we had was a

boatload of children but we're the

only ship in the quadrant. Spock:

those cadets of yours -- how good

are they? How will they respond

under real pressure?

SPOCK

Like all living beings, Admiral

each according to his gifts. The

ship is yours.

KIRK

That won't be necessary: just take

me to Regula I.

SPOCK

Excuse my presumption, but I do not

agree. As a teacher on a training

mission, I am content to command a

Starship. If we are to go on actual

duty, it is clear that the senior

officer aboard must assume command.

KIRK

But it may be nothing; garbled

communications. Why don't you...

SPOCK

You proceed from a false assumption.

I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

KIRK

You are going to remind me that

logic alone dictates your actions.

SPOCK

I was going to remind you of nothing,

least of all that which you know well.

(pause)

Your mistake, if I may be so bold,

was promotion. Commanding a Starship

is your first best destiny. Anything

else is a waste of material.

KIRK

I would not presume to debate you.

SPOCK

That is wise. In any case, were I

to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates

that the needs of the many outweigh

the needs of the few.

KIRK

Or the one.

SPOCK

You are my superior officer. You

are also my friend. I have been

and always shall be yours.

KIRK

Will you accompany me to the bridge?

I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first

so that he may, in his own words,

explain the situation to his cadets.

you're saying?

its moral implications, Doctor.

As a matter of cosmic history, it

has always been easier to destroy

than to create --

Not anymore! Now you can do both

at the same time! According to myth,

the earth was created in six days.

we'll do it for you in six minutes --

KIRK

Khan, listen to me -- if its me you

want, I'll have myself beamed aboard.

All I ask is that you spare my crew.

KHAN

That is a most intriguing offer.

Typical, I must say of your sterling

character. Let me think.

I make you a counter-proposal, I will

agree to your terms, if in addition

to yourself, you turn over to me all

data and material regarding the

project called Genesis.

KIRK

Genesis, what's that?

KHAN

Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is

on the phaser control --

KIRK

Give me some time to recall the data

on our computers --

KHAN

I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.

SPOCK

Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...

KIRK

At least we know he hasn't got it.

Just keep nodding as though I'm

giving orders. Saavik, punch up the

data charts of Reliant's command

console -- hurry...

HURRY.

SPOCK

It's all we've got.

The prefix code is 16309. All

commands from each Starship bridge

KHAN

Thirty seconds...

just what we're attempting; using

KIRK

Wait for my signal, Spock -- too

soon and he'll have time to figure

it out and raise them again.

KIRK

Khan, how do I know you'll keep

your word?

KHAN

I've given you no word to keep,

Admiral. In my judgment, you simply

have no alternative.

I take your point. Stand by to

receive our transmission.

Captured us. He -- he put creatures

in our bodies. To control our minds.

Captain. Where is Dr. Marcus?

Where are the Genesis materials?

TERRELL

He couldn't find them. Some of

the scientists were still here,

but everything else, even the data

banks -- were empty.

SAAVIK

That's true, Admiral. All the

memory cells have been emptied.

KIRK

(ponders)

Erased...

TERRELL

He tortured those people. None of

them would tell him anything. He

went wild, strung them up and slit

their throats. He wanted to tear

the place apart, but he was late:

he had to get back to Reliant in

time to blow you to bits.

KIRK

He came damn close...

CHEKOV

He left us.

(with irony)

We were no longer of use.

SAAVIK

Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?

TERRELL

Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's

completely mad, Admiral. He blames

you for the death of his wife...

KIRK

I know what he blames me for.

KIRK

Did he make it down here?

CHEKOV

It was not my impression. He spent

most of his time trying to wring the

information out of the people.

SAAVIK

Anything?

KIRK

Somebody left the unit on. If

everyone else was dead, it implies

that no one remained to turn it off.

Those people back there bought escape

time for Genesis with their lives.

SAAVIK

It doesn't make sense. These

coordinates are well within

Regula -- a plantoid we know to be

lifeless and airless.

KIRK

(wheels turn)

If Stage Two was completed, it was

underground -- she said it was going

to be underground.

SAAVIK

Stage Two of what?

KIRK

Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report,

Spock?

SPOCK'S VOICE

Admiral, if we go by the book, like

Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem

like days.

KIRK

I read you, Captain. Let's have it.

SPOCK'S VOICE

The situation is grave, Admiral. We

won't have main power for

six days

at least. Auxiliary power has

temporarily failed, but maybe we can

restore that in

two days

. By the

book, Admiral.

KIRK

Meaning you can't even beam us back?

SPOCK'S VOICE

Not at present.

KIRK

Captain Spock, if you do not hear

from us within

one hour

your orders

are to restore what power you can,

take the Enterprise to the nearest

Star Base and alert Starfleet

command when you are out of jamming

range.

UHURA'S VOICE

Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!

KIRK

Uhura, if you don't hear from us,

there won't be anybody behind. Kirk

You gentleman can remain here, or...

If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd

like to share the risk.

David was right, wasn't he? It's

just to keep them busy.

KIRK

Why? Why didn't you tell me?

CAROL

How can you ask me that? Were we

together? Where we going to be?

You had your world and I had mine.

I wanted him in mine, not chasing

through the universe with his father.

CAROL

(continuing)

He's a lot like you in many ways.

Nothing I could do about it. He's

smarter, of course; that goes without

saying. Most of Genesis is really

his.

This is it, isn't it? We're never

going to get out of here.

Please. Tell me what you're feeling.

KIRK

There's a man I haven't seen in

fifteen years who thinks he's killed

me. You show me a son who'd almost be

happy to help him. My son. My life

that could have been and wasn't. What

am I feeling? I'm feeling old --

worn out.

Let me show you something that will

make you feel young -- young as when

the world was new.

The no-win scenario -- and with

what philosophy a commander faces

defeat.

KIRK

Are you asking me if we are playing

out that scenario now, Lieutenant?

SAAVIK

On the test, sir, will you tell me

what you did? I'd really like to

know.

Lieutenant, you are looking at the

only Starfleet cadet who ever beat

the no-win scenario --

KIRK

SAAVIK

was possible to rescue the ship.

?

Three minutes, thirty seconds.

Four hundred kilometers.

disappearing in the swirls of:

which clears the flame and --

roaring through space -- and:

The WHINE increases to fever pitch, then: she goes!

As Reliant goes, so goes the nebula. The "Genesis

Effect" WE SAW in its earliest experiments, now

seems familiar on a gigantic, cosmic scale.

The blinding flash at first, followed by the same

tumbling turbulence of the miniature test. It is

awesome.

Jim, you'd better get down here. Hurry.

Saavik, take the con.

He's dead already, Jim.

Oh, God.

Spock!

SPOCK

The ship -- out of danger?

KIRK

Yes --

SPOCK

Don't grieve, Admiral -- it's

logical: the good of the many

outweighs --

KIRK

... the good of the few...

SPOCK

Or the one.

SPOCK

(continuing)

I never took the

Kobayashi Maru

test -- until now. What do you

think of my solution?

KIRK

Spock...!

SPOCK

I have been -- and always will be

-- your friend... Live. Long. And.

Prosper.

KIRK

No...!

Admiral, you've got to see this!

There's new life -- a whole new

world, a Genesis world -- !

KIRK

In accordance with the traditions

of Starfleet and of Article 184

Starfleet Regulations, we are

assembled here today to pay final

respects to our honored dead.

KIRK

(continuing)

And yet, in the midst of our sorrow

it should be noted that this death

takes place in the shadow of new

life, the sunrise of a new world,

a world that our beloved comrade

gave his own life to protect and

nourish. He did not feel that

sacrifice a vain or empty one --

and we will not debate his profound

wisdom, in these proceedings. Of

my friend, I can only say this, that

of all the souls I have encountered

in my travels, his was the most --

(he falters)

-- human.

KIRK

(continuing)

Lieutenant Saavik.

Lieutenant.

KIRK

(continuing; very

quietly)

After you dismiss the company, you

will take the watch. Set course

for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up

survivors.

SAAVIK

Aye, sir.

KIRK

I'll be in my quarters if needed,

but I would prefer...

SAAVIK

Understood, sir.

KIRK

(aloud)

Dismiss the company.

Yes... come.

DAVID

I don't mean to intrude.

KIRK

Uh, no...

(rises)

I should be on the bridge.

DAVID

Are you running away from me?

KIRK

I suppose I was.

(pause)

I poured a drink. Would you like

it?

DAVID

No. I -- I guess I'm not what you

expected.

KIRK

(rueful)

I didn't expect anything.

DAVID

That makes two of us.

(he studies his

father)

Lieutenant Saavik was right: you

never have faced death --

KIRK

(hoarse)

Not like this -- no. I haven't faced

death, I cheated death. I tricked

my way out of death and patted myself

on the back for my ingenuity. I

know nothing.

DAVID

You knew enough to tell Saavik that

how we face death is at least as

important as how we face life --

KIRK

It was just words.

DAVID

But good words. That's where ideas

begin. Maybe you should listen to

them.

KIRK

I'm trying, David.

DAVID

So am I. My friends were killed,

too.

KIRK

I am truly sorry.

DAVID

I was wrong about you. And

I'm

sorry.

KIRK

Is that what you came here to say?

DAVID

Mainly.

(he starts out,

then turns -- )

And also that I'm proud -- very

proud -- to be your son.

Admiral on the bridge!

KIRK

As you were, Mr. Saavik.

SAAVIK

Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha.

All is well.

KIRK

Good, I believe you already know

my, uh, son --

KIRK

(continuing)

Yes, well, why don't you show him

around and...

SAAVIK

Aye, sir --

SAAVIK

(continuing)

So

you

turn out to be the dumb

bastard.

SAAVIK

(continuing)

That is a little joke.

BONES

She's changed her hair again.

(pause)

Will you look at that? Think

they'll name it for you, Doctor?

CAROL

Not if I can help it. We'll name

it for our friend.

KIRK

(quietly)

It is a far far better thing I do

than I have ever done before... a

far better resting place I go to

than I have ever known...

CAROL

(soft)

Is that a poem?

KIRK

Something Spock was trying to

tell me. On my birthday.

BONES

You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

KIRK

(considers; smiles)

Young. I feel young, Doctor.
