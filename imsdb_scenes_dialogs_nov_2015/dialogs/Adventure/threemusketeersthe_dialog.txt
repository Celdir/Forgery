THE THREE MUSKETEERS

OPEN ON:

1   EXT. GASCONY - DAWN                                        1

Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree-

tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox

darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out

of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL.

SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625.

Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points

cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The

first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every

facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance

and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this

moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous

cry.

They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew.

Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is

nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the

air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer-

saults. This is fun.

Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden

fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they

fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of

hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots.

Anything goes as the swords cut through the air.

D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard

up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly

cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof,

fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles...

and follows.

2   ANGLE ON ROOFTOP                                           2

Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard

and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause

to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other

side, attacking, defending, as they go.

3   INCLUDE INTERIOR                                           3

Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances

up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof.

She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open

window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side.

2.

4   BACK TO SCENE                                              4

Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en-

closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies

after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild

progress frequently resembles that of a young colt --

stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his

sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan

parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over

the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and

rises to fight again.

The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de-

volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly

endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the

last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow-

moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs

toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan

with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes

when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap

to join him.

And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of

music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn-

ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just

then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard

backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he

stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He

prepares one last blow --

-- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the

side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical

antidote to all this glorious swordplay.

5   INCLUDE CREEK                                              5

Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of

reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with

grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation

will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and

lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's

apple.

A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh,

long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.

D'ARTAGNAN

Had enough?

GIRARD

(breathless

deadpan)

I believe now would be a good

time to end your, uhm, formal

training. Well done.

(CONTINUED)

D'ARTAGNAN

Thank you, sir.

D'Artagnan leaps to his feet, races off without another

word. Girard struggles upward, peers at the shape of his

clothing -- cut to ribbons, muddy and soaked.

GIRARD

And god have mercy on whomever

you meet next.

She stands at the open window, watches his coltish high

steps with love. Sadness too.

CUT TO:

8   INT. D'ARTAGNAN'S HOME - DAY                                  8

D'Artagnan steps through the country manor, calls out:

D'ARTAGNAN

Mother...?

But he does not see her.    D'Artagnan continues, chatter-

ing proudly as he goes.

D'ARTAGNAN

Did you see us? You heard us,

I'll bet. Girard finally

surrendered a compliment...

though I almost had to kill him

to get it... Mother...?

D'Artagnan comes upon an open door, a small room beyond.

He pauses, then steps inside.

9   INCLUDE FATHER'S STUDY                                        9

A Spartan interior. Heraldic emblems upon the wall, sou-

venirs from battles won and lost.

A piece of parchment, on it the words: "All For One, and

One For All." And, in a place of honor, a worn blue and

gold tunic. Below it, the Handsome Woman, d'Artagnan's

mother, kneels at an open chest. She turns back to him.

MOTHER (HANDSOME WOMAN)

Sit down.

D'ARTAGNAN

Didn't you hear me? Girard --

MOTHER

Sit.

D'Artagnan sighs, sits in a large wooden chair. A beat.

His mother speaks quietly, eyes turned back to the open

chest.

MOTHER

Your father was a proud man. And

he had a right to be. I never

knew one as brave or as kind. He

knew that his strength was a gift

to be given in the service of

honor. That is why he dedicated

his life to his country and his

King. That is why he gave his

life, for both.

She reaches into the chest, carefully extracts a

beautiful saber.

MOTHER

I watched you this morning and

saw someone I knew. You have

your father's heart, his will to

fight, his courage. But these

gifts have no value unless they

are given.

She rises, holds the sword out to him.

MOTHER

It's time for you find your

fortune with men as brave and

as bold as you are. In Paris.

With the King's Musketeers.

(re: sword)

You'll need this.

D'ARTAGNAN

(quiet, moved)

Father's sword.

MOTHER

I'm not your mother now. I'm

speaking for your father. And

this is what he would have told

you. Never forget the code of

the d'Artagnans. It is your

special heritage.

(beat)

Always seek out adventure...

D'ARTAGNAN

I will.

MOTHER

Never run from a fight...

D'ARTAGNAN

I won't.

MOTHER

Never submit to insults.    Except

from the King.

D'ARTAGNAN

Never.

MOTHER

And be wary of Cardinal Richelieu

for he rules France through the

King.

D'ARTAGNAN

Mother. Maybe I should wait.

Until after harvest.

MOTHER

You've heard that every man in

the Musketeers is on the run from

someone or something?

D'ARTAGNAN

Yes.   But what am I running from?

MOGHER

(gentle humor)

A shrew of a mother, and a drafty

old house. Now go.

MOTHER

And for heaven's sake, practice

your horsemanship.

D'ARTAGNAN

Horsemanship.    Got it.

Or haven't you heard?

(cold command)

Throw it on the fire.

Musketeers...

ROCHEFORT

By joint edict of His Majesty

King Louis XIII and His Eminence

Cardinal Richelieu, the

Musketeers are officially

disbanded. In preparation for

the coming war with England, your

ranks and commissions are hereby

transferred to the Infantry. You

will be contacted and told where

to report. Until that time, you

are instructed to return to your

homes.

DE TREVILLE

(shouting to

Rochefort)

And who will protect the King?

ROCHEFORT

The Cardinal's Guards are more

than capable of assuming that...

responsibility.

ROCHEFORT

You are hereby ordered to

disperse. Should even one of you

resist... the entire corps will

be arrested and imprisoned.

and disdain)

'All for one, and one for all.'

ATHOS

A private party. Go away.

ARAMIS

Athos -- is that any way to greet

our guests?

ARAMIS

Don't be shy, gentlemen. Come

in. Your friends have been

expecting you.

JUSSAC

Your presence is requested at

Musketeer Headquarters by Captain

Rochefort.

ATHOS

The Cyclops is a Captain? He

must've made a pact with the

Devil.

ARAMIS

Or the Cardinal.

ATHOS

What's the difference?

(with an edge

of contempt)

The Devil is more ethical than

the Cardinal.

JUSSAC

You're instructed to come with

me and surrender your tunics.

ATHOS

These gentlemen made a similar

request.

JUSSAC

Are you refusing to come

peaceably?

ATHOS

Probably. But I'll leave it up

to my companions. Aramis?

ARAMIS

We can't refuse Rochefort's

invitation. It would be

impolite.

ATHOS

And what do you say, Porthos?

Ready when you are.

Congratulations, Porthos.   You

ROCHEFORT

You are hereby ordered to

surrender your commissions and

reassignment in the King's Army.

ATHOS

And if we refuse?

ROCHEFORT

You will become outlaws.   Hunted

men.

PORTHOS

It doesn't matter where I go or

what I do. Sooner or later

somebody's calling me 'outlaw.'

ROCHEFORT

Are you refusing to serve your

King?

ARAMIS

We are refusing to serve the

Cardinal.

PORTHOS

Same thing, these days.

ARAMIS

France has one King too many.

ROCHEFORT

I'll tell him you said that.

ATHOS

Do that, Rochefort. Tell his

Emminence the Cardinal that we

will continue to perform our sworn

duty to protect the King. From

enemies across the sea.

ROCHEFORT

I'll make sure His Emminence the

Cardinal gets the message. But I

can't promise he'll be pleased.

PORTHOS

Well, if we're going to be

outlaws, I suppose we'll have to

get our affairs in order.

ARAMIS

Are you going to visit them

alphabetically or in order of

preference?

PORTHOS

Alphabetically seems... fair.

ARAMIS

When it comes to you and women,

fairness rarely applies.

We'll meet at the Columbier-Rouge

DAMSEL

Excuse me, Monsieur Aramis. But

when you started talking about

Original Sin, I lost control and

became impassioned. It won't

happen again.

ARAMIS

There's nothing unholy about

expressing one's emotions. On

the contrary. Religion should be

experienced in a passionate, all-

embracing way. We should feel

free to express our spirituality.

DAMSEL

Yes, darling!

MAN (O.S.)

Open up!

DAMSEL

(a gasp of fear)

My husband!

ARAMIS

Your husband!?

DAMSEL

Aramis -- run!

First we must pray to God for

forgiveness.

On second thought, God's often

busy.

Thanks. You broke my fall

perfectly. But I do apologize

for the inconvenience...

D'ARTAGNAN

Get off me!

ARAMIS

If there's one thing I can't

abide, it's rudeness.

D'ARTAGNAN

You fell on me!

ARAMIS

And I apologized for it.

D'ARTAGNAN

I suppose you'd like to teach me a

lesson in manners, too.

ARAMIS

I'd be honored.

But your welfare is

more than a matter of personal

secret is safe with me.

ANNE

Thank you.

RICHELIEU

You're homesick.

ANNE

(after a beat)

Lonely. Is that the same thing?

RICHELIEU

Sometimes.

RICHELIEU

Austria's loss is France's gain.

ANNE

I'm not sure my new husband shares

your opinion.

RICHELIEU

Nonsense.    He's young, not blind.

ANNE

Mostly, he is absent. I've barely

seen His Majesty since our wedding,

and that was three months ago.

Whenever he's around me, he has

nothing to say.

RICHELIEU

Arranged marriages can be

difficult. Your father and I

thought yours would bring Austria

and France closer together.

ANNE

Countries align more swiftly than

people, I'm afraid. Louis and I

remain... far apart.

RICHELIEU

May I advise you?

RICHELIEU

Louis was only nine years old

when his father was assassinated.

He lost his childhood forever that

day. I have watched him grow

toward manhood, seen the toll his

life demands. A boy who is not

allowed to be a boy sometimes has

difficulty becoming a man. He is

shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet

stubborn. But most of all, he is

not yet sure exactly who he is.

The boy who lost his father. Or

the King of France.

ANNE

But how can I...?

RICHELIEU

Flatter him. Make the boy feel

like a King. So that the King

may be your husband.

SENESCHAL

His Majesty, the King.

RICHELIEU

Your Majesty.

Cardinal Richelieu, I've been

you were here.

No.  Please, stay.

that she is watching

him)

Your Eminence, I demand an answer.

RICHELIEU

(hiding his amusement)

Perhaps if I knew the question...

LOUIS

I've just been told that you went

ahead and disbanded my Musketeers.

RICHELIEU

You approved the decision.

LOUIS

But not the timing of the matter.

I intended to address them myself,

explain the situation...

RICHELIEU

Your Majesty, France is on the

brink of war. We dare not

hesitate.

LOUIS

But these men are my personal

guards...

RICHELIEU

They are the bravest fighters in

France.

We'll need them in the

field if we're to win this war

with England. Buckingham plans

to invade La Rochelle within the

month. I thought it best to act

quickly --

LOUIS

I will be the judge of what is

best. For me, and for France.

RICHELIEU

Of course.   Forgive me.

LOUIS

Anne?   Are you all right?

ANNE

You two should continue this

discussion in private.

LOUIS

Your thoughts on the matter

interest me. They might... help.

Sometimes she scares me half to

death.

RICHELIEU

May I advise you?

RICHELIEU

She scares me too. As do all

women who join beauty to

intelligence. What's a man to

do?

LOUIS

(enjoying the Cardinal's

humor)

I have no idea.

RICHELIEU

The course of love is full of

frightful turns. But, no matter

how you feel, no matter how

hopelessly afraid... never let

her know that you are anything

other than the bravest and most

confident man in France. Make

that your starting point, and

everything else will fall... into

place.

LOUIS

The bravest man in France...

RICHELIEU

Good advice for a shopkeeper.

Let alone a King.

LOUIS

Your Eminence, I'm sorry that I

was sharp with you. It's just

that the Musketeers... well, they're

not just my guards. They're my

friends too.

RICHELIEU

Why not? Becoming a Musketeer is

the fantasy of every young

Frenchman. Or should I say it

was...

(with seeming

kindness, reason)

Like the Knights of the Round

Table, the Musketeers have

outlived their usefulness. They

are a thing of the past.

(beat)

And so have your three friends.

Tell me where they are, d'Artagnan,

and I will spare your life.

D'ARTAGNAN

I'm sorry. But I can't tell you

what I do not know.

RICHELIEU

In that case, give my regards to

the headsman.

D'ARTAGNAN

What about my trial?

RICHELIEU

You've just had it.

D'ARTAGNAN

Wait --

RICHELIEU

Why? Do you object to losing

your head?

D'ARTAGNAN

Yes.   I like it where it is.

RICHELIEU

Then tell me what I want to know,

and perhaps you will keep it there

a few years longer.

RICHELIEU

And if you did?

D'ARTAGNAN

RICHELIEU

I admire your courage, young man.

You might have made a fine

Musketeer after all.

RICHELIEU

But we'll never know, will we?

RICHELIEU

Find the three Musketeers and kill

them.

ROCHEFORT

They'll be dead by dawn.

RICHELIEU

A comforting thought. Good night,

d'Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning

the manly art of wenching. Right,

ladies?

PORTHOS

Ahh, very good. Your first

subject. But you'll need

instruction. Watch closely.

PORTHOS

The secret to wenching is the

first kiss. For in that kiss, a

lasting impression is made. If it

is weak, she will think you are

weak. And if it is comical, she

will think you are a clown. With

me?

D'ARTAGNAN

Weak... weak.    Comical... clown.

Rough winds do shake the darling

And summer's leash hath all too

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven

And often is his gold complexion

And every fair from fair sometimes

But thy eternal summer shall not

Would you like to hear a story,

Yes.

I once knew a man... one of the

Counts of Berry. My native

province. When the good Count was

about your age, he fell in love

with a visitor from Paris. A

breathtaking girl of seventeen.

She was more than beautiful,

d'Artagnan. She was...

intoxicating. And this man, the

poor idiot, he married her.

D'ARTAGNAN

Isn't that what people do when

they fall in love?

ATHOS

(sharply)

Be quiet and listen.

(beat)

The Count took her to his castle

and made her the first lady of the

province. They were happy for a

time, as happy as a man and a

woman can be. Then one day, while

riding in the woods, the girl was

thrown from her horse, and knocked

unconscious. The Count hurried to

help her. Her dress was torn.

On her her arm, the woman wore a

gold band in the shape of a

serpent. It was the only article

of clothing she refused to remove.

The Count's curiosity got the best

of him. He reached over and slid

down the gold band. He saw

something on her arm... something

she'd kept hidden 'til then...

D'ARTAGNAN

What?

ATHOS

The fleur d'lis. She'd been

branded...

a murderess who escaped the

Executioner's blade. She swore

that she loved him. Swore that

she had changed. And if he would

just keep her secret, they would

live a long life together.

ATHOS

But the Count was young and he was

stupid. He was tormented by the

ridicule of his social class. And

so he rejected her. For her lies

and for her past.

And turned her over to the

authorities to be executed for the

crime.

Good.   More for me.

PORTHOS

You know,   d'Artagnan, it's not a

A connon ball.

PORTHOS

I hate cannon balls.

ARAMIS

To show the world that the King of

France... that he is King.

There are so many to choose from.

Is it the one about my alleged

Cool, clear water. WIDEN to reveal d'Artagnan and Athos

at a shallow pond, watering their horses. The forest

around them is dark and primeval.

D'ARTAGNAN

Do you think we've lost them?

ATHOS

They'll catch up eventually.

To the point, as always. D'Artagnan pauses to look at

their beautiful surroundings, remembers:

D'ARTAGNAN

My father used to hunt in a forest

like this. He promised to take me

on my tenth birthday. I don't know

why he picked that year. Something

about a boy becoming a man. I'd

lay in bed at night and imagine it,

just the two of us. But he died

before I could go with him.

Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.       He replies with

quiet cynicism:

ATHOS

Well. You have your boyhood wish

at last. The dark forest. The

thrill of the hunt. The nearness

of death.

Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.

D'ARTAGNAN

I'd be proud to die for my King.

ATHOS

I just wanted to save you from the

life of a Musketeer. You don't

have to go looking for experience,

d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon

enough. And when it does -- it

will mark you forever.

Athos rides into the forest.    D'Artagnan hurries to

follow.

96.

101   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                         101

Athos leads d'Artagnan through the forest. Sunbeams

shoot down through thick branches like golden bars. A

pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING

HOOFBEATS. Athos and d'Artagnan turn in surprise, see

SIX HORSEMEN CRASHING through the glade.

102   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             102

Athos and d'Artagnan GALLOP through the dense forest.

The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes

d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount.

Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at

the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all

around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag-

gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the

crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with

Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a

SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others

curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ

back and forth like angry hornets.

Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered.

The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to

tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads:

ATHOS

I'll hold them off for as long as

I can. Go on without me.

D'ARTAGNAN

I can't leave you here. Not like

this.

ATHOS

Ride to Calais and stop the

Cardinal's agent.

D'ARTAGNAN

Athos... I can't.

Athos points his pistol at d'Artagnan.

ATHOS

Go, or I'll kill you myself.

A few days ago, d'Artagnan would have obeyed without

question. Fearful, if nothing else. But not here, not

now.

D'ARTAGNAN

A duel then.

ATHOS

You're insane.

D'ARTAGNAN

We never finished the first.

ATHOS

All right. I'll toss a coin.

Tails I stay, heads you remain.

Agreed?

D'Artagnan nods. Athos FIRES off another SHOT. He

produces a gold coin, flips, slams it between palm and

hand. And looks between.

103   ATHOS AND HIS POV                                              103

Heads. D'Artagnan is to remain.       Athos looks up without

missing a beat.

ATHOS

Tails.    I stay.

Athos returns the coin to his doublet without giving

d'Artagnan a chance to see.

D'ARTAGNAN

But...?

Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the

kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express

it. And that there is no use arguing with him.

D'ARTAGNAN

At least take my pistol.

He gives it to Athos.      They clasp hands.

ATHOS

(gruff; yet proud)

Don't let us down... Musketeer.

There are tears in d'Artagnan's eyes.       He knows Athos

hasn't got a chance.

D'ARTAGNAN

(a choke of emotion)

I'll never forget you.

ATHOS

Go!

Athos turns away, SHOOTS at another horseman.       D'Artagnan

runs to his MOUNT, GALLOPS away.

98.

104   D'ARTAGNAN                                                     104

He rides, straining to hear the sounds of GUNFIRE. As

long as the SHOTS continue, he knows Athos is alive.

Abruptly... the SHOTS CEASE.

D'Artagnan swallows his heart, and rides.

105   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                    105

A lonely stretch of road, illuminated by moonlight. A

signpost announces: CALAI 15 LEAGUES. An exhausted

HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the

saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes

open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from

his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He

opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then

closes them.

We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING.

The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt

just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we

can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback,

bodyguards to the carriage's passenger. Milady de

Winter.

MILADY (O.S.)

What is it, Henri?

HENRI (DRIVER)

There's a body in the road, Milady.

MILADY (O.S.)

Be careful.

Pistols are cocked.    Henri's shadow falls across

d'Artagnan's body.

HENRI

It's a young man. He appears to

be injured.

We hear the CARRIAGE DOOR OPEN.     FOOTSTEPS to d'Artagnan's

side.

MILADY (O.S.)

My, what a handsome boy. Put him

inside with me.

Strong hands grasp d'Artagnan and lift him from the cold

ground.

Out of the darkness, a face appears,   BLURRY and OBSCURED.

It FILLS the SCREEN, slowly swimming   INTO FOCUS. It is

Milady de Winter, even more beautiful   in CLOSEUP.

Familiar, and no doubt deadly, ivory   combs gleam in her

hair. She smiles warmly.

MILADY

Welcome back.    Did you dream?

107   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               107

reveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn.

D'Artagnan, regaining his senses, finds himself propped

up in a large bed. He blinks into the face of Milady

who sits at the edge. His eyes widen with recognition,

faint awe.

D'ARTAGNAN

You.

MILADY

Have we met?

D'ARTAGNAN

I... saw you in Paris.

D'Artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged.

He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the

grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table.

D'Artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain:

D'ARTAGNAN

Where am I...?

MILADY

This is Calais.

D'ARTAGNAN

(with a jolt)

Calais!

(muttered; to self)

The ship... Tuesday at midnight...

D'Artagnan leaps out of bed. Then realizes he is stark

naked. Milady smiles. D'Artagnan gathers a bedsheet

around him.

D'ARTAGNAN

(frantic)

Where are my clothes?

MILADY

Filthy. I'm having them cleaned.

Is something wrong?

D'ARTAGNAN

What day is it? What time?!

D'Artagnan runs to a window, and throws open the shutters.

Beyond: the harbor lights of the Port of Calais.

MILADY

It's Tuesday, near nine.

D'ARTAGNAN

Nine?   Are you sure?

Somewhere in the night, a BELL TOLLS the HOUR.        Milady

smiles.

MILADY

Quite sure.

D'Artagnan relaxes slightly.        Milady rises from the bed.

She wears a sky blue dressing       gown, something soft and

silken beneath it. D'Artagnan        reacts perceptibly. En-

joying his discomfort, Milady       crosses the room, joins

him at the window.

MILADY

Are you in a hurry?

D'ARTAGNAN

(after a beat)

How did I... get here?

MILADY

I found you in the road.

Discarded. Like an unwanted

kitten. Do you have a name or

shall I make one up for you?

D'ARTAGNAN

(nervous)

My name is d'Artagnan.

MILADY

D'Artagnan. I like that. I am

the Countess de Winter. Milady.

D'ARTAGNAN

Countess?

She manages to combine sympathy, seduction, and just a

hint of danger. All in a single reply. D'Artagnan

hesitates, he is not immune to her charms, then:

D'ARTAGNAN

Countess, I'm very grateful for

what you've done, but I can't stay

here. I've got...

MILADY

What...?

D'ARTAGNAN

Important business.

MILADY

How mysterious. A handsome young

man with 'important business' in

the still of night. Does it

involve a young lady?

D'ARTAGNAN

No.

MILADY

Does it require clothes?

D'ARTAGNAN

Yes.   I need my clothes.

MILADY

They won't be ready for at least

an hour.

D'ARTAGNAN

An hour?

MILADY

I told the  innkeeper to bring them

when they  are dry. Until then,

I'm afraid  you are my prisoner.

Would the  prisoner care for a

drink?

Milady crosses to the table, food and drink upon it. As

she passes by the fire, her dressing gown seems to disap-

pear, revealing a silhouette that makes d'Artagnan's

heart stop.

D'ARTAGNAN

(always innocent;

never coy)

I am... thirsty.

Milady pours wine into glasses, turns to face him.      And

offers a smile that dazzles and burns.

MILADY

Good. Then we will sit by the

fire, and eat and drink, and you

may impress, perhaps even move me,

with the story of how you came to

lie unconscious, in the middle of

the night, on the road to Calais.

(soft seductively)

I love a good adventure.

D'Artagnan hesitates, then steps to her.

CUT TO:

108   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS CARDINAL (PARIS) - NIGHT                  108

A CARRIER PIGEON FLUTTERS out of the dark sky, and enters

its box. The little door on the other side opens. A

hand reaches in and removes the bird. Richelieu unpeels

the message on its leg.

CUT TO:

109   INT. CARDINAL'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - NIGHT                       109

A room as cold as the man who owns it. Behind

Richelieu's desk, there is a life-sized portrait of the

King. Rochefort occupies a window seat, cleaning

d'Artagnan's sword. He lifts it to the light, and

slashes the air. He stands, duels with an imaginary

opponent. Richelieu enters with the message.

RICHELIEU

(dry; re: Rochefort's

fencing)

The wonderful thing about an

imaginary opponent is that he is

always greatly skilled, and always

easily defeated. The pride of

victory, without the risk of loss.

If only life were like that.

Richelieu sits at his desk, peers at the message.      He

looks up, pleased.

109   CONTINUED:                                                       109

RICHELIEU

Milady has reached Calais.

ROCHEFORT

I told you not to worry about the

Musketeers. They are dead by now.

RICHELIEU

Buckingham's signature will be on

the treaty by morning.

ROCHEFORT

The King's birthday celebration...?

RICHELIEU

Will proceed as planned. Thanks

to the kind intercession of Queen

Anne.

Rochefort steps closer, speaks quietly.

ROCHEFORT

And our plans...?

RICHELIEU

(knowingly)

Will proceed as well.

Richelieu pours two glasses of port, offers one to

Rochefort. They turn, raise their glasses to the

King's portrait. And drink.

CUT TO:

110   INT. MILADY'S CHAMBER AT INN - NIGHT                      110

D'Artagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front

of the roaring fire. The plate of food between them is

empty. They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains

his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady

speaks quietly, with seeming compassion:

MILADY

You are sad.

D'ARTAGNAN

I was thinking about my friends.

Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She

looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to

continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All

conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks

quietly, from the heart:

D'ARTAGNAN

The three best friends a man could

have. We were separated on our

way to Calais. I'm afraid I'll

never see them again.

MILADY

What brings you here?

D'ARTAGNAN

I'd like to tell you. But I can't.

MILADY

'Important business.'

D'Artagnan nods. He wants to impress her. He wants her

to know how brave he is. And Milady is well aware of it.

She looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose.

MILADY

I understand. Men make bold plans

in secret. And women wait... to

mourn, or to celebrate the outcome.

I know from experience, it's a

lonely vigil.

D'ARTAGNAN

(after a beat)

All I can tell you is... I'm on a

mission for the King.

MILADY

(looks up; laughs

lightly)

I've heard that one before.

D'ARTAGNAN

I'm serious.

MILADY

You are a young man. And young

men are given to exaggeration.

However, if you would like to

entertain me with a story, I'm

eager to hear it. And please,

make it very brave, filled with

handsome knights and beautiful

ladies. I know, a dragon --

There is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than

a woman who does not take him seriously. D'Artagnan acts

accordingly, and reveals:

D'ARTAGNAN

I came to Calais to stop a spy

from sailing to England.

MILADY

(alert; though

d'Artagnan doesn't

see it)

A spy...?

D'ARTAGNAN

Yes.

MILADY

I believe you...

(beat)

Aren't you afraid?

D'ARTAGNAN

Musketeers are not afraid of

anything.

MILADY

I knew it. I knew you were a

Musketeer the moment I saw you.

D'ARTAGNAN

You did?

MILADY

Of course.

(with sudden concern)

But, d'Artagnan, if this spy was

to find out you are here, your

life could be in grave danger.

D'ARTAGNAN

A Musketeer is not afriad of

danger.

MILADY

I'm dangerous. You're not afraid

of me?

Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the

look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him.

But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider.

And midnight as it approaches.

D'ARTAGNAN

You're not dangerous.

MILADY

Then what am I?

(CONTINUED)

106.

110   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              110

D'ARTAGNAN

You're... beautiful.

Milady covers him with caresses. D'Artagnan resists

slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied.

Milady leans close, runs a fingertip along     the line of

his jaw. Her dressing gown falls open at      the top, enough

for d'Artagnan to see her breasts as they     press against

the silk beneath it. Milady speaks as her      finger traces.

MILADY

Beauty, danger. They are the same.

And with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory

comb...

111   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                  111

He cannot continue.      Constance, the hour, a confusion he

cannot deny.

D'ARTAGNAN

I'm sorry --

D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down

toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a

dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in

the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking

the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out-

stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger,

stunned with fear and surprise:

D'ARTAGNAN

What're you doing?! Have you lost

your mind?!

MILADY

You came to Calais to stop a spy

from sailing to England.

D'Artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge. Milady is the

messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to

the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her

negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh,

reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of

the fleur de lis. The infamous mark of the murderess.

Just as Athos told it to him.      Not so long ago.

D'ARTAGNAN

My God...

111   CONTINUED:                                                      111

MILADY

(crying out)

Parker!!

The chamber door flies open. Henri and Parker, the Indo-

Chinese bodyguard, appear. Parker faces d'Artagnan with

a half-smile. He holds out his hands, both empty. And

steps toward him. D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his

right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un-

fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps

forward to meet him.

Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A

series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows.

The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the

martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet,

dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions.

Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair,

and commands:

MILADY

Kill him.

Parker holds him fast. Henri steps forward.        And

d'Artagnan thinks fast.

D'ARTAGNAN

You can kill me. But a surprise

waits for you in England. That

even Buckingham can't prevent.

MILADY

(stops Henri with

a gesture)

What... surprise?

D'ARTAGNAN

That's one thing I'll never tell

you.

MILADY

D'Artagnan. You are young, vain,

and foolish. But I do not know

if you are clever.

D'Artagnan's expression reveals nothing. Except to

suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping.

Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes

her mind.

MILADY

We'll take him with us.

MILADY (CONT'D)

(to d'Artagnan,

with a nod at

Parker)

Parker will devise ways to

convince you to share your final

secret with me. It is a long

voyage.

Milady's eyes show nothing but cold cruelty.

CUT TO:

112   INT. INN - UPPER HALL AND LANDING - NEAR DAWN                112

Milady emerges from her room, dressed for travel. She is

followed by d'Artagnan, now clothed. He is flanked by

Henri and Parker. Henri presses the blade of a knife

against d'Artagnan's side.

HENRI

The bodyguards are waiting outside.

Milady leads them down the hall. But when she reaches

the landing, and looks at the tavern below... she draws

back with surprise.

113   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MILADY AND HER POV                          113

The innkeeper, roused   from sleep, and wearing a night-

shirt, is engaged in   urgent conversation with Armand de

Winter -- the son of   the man Milady killed in Paris. The

innkeeper shakes his   head. Armand grabs him by the

collar.

D'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience,

and just a hint of fear. Milady commands:

MILADY

The back stairs. Hurry!

They change directions. As he is pulled away, d'Artagnan

catches a glimpse of Armand de Winter below.

CUT TO:

114   EXT. INN - NIGHT                                             114

Milady's coach emerges from the carriage house, speeds

away in the direction of the harbor. In the driver's

seat, Henri whips the horses, driving them onward.

Milady's seven bodyguards follow on horseback.

CUT TO:

109.

115   INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT                                     115

D'Artagnan and Parker  sit across from Milady. Her face

betrays faint doubt,  apprehension. Emotions she is not

used to feeling, let  alone displaying to the world around

her. D'Artagnan sees   his opening... and speaks:

D'ARTAGNAN

The man at the inn... what did

he want?

MILADY

(hollow laugh)

Justice. Honor. Revenge.

D'ARTAGNAN

Why?

MILADY

He is the brother of my late

husband, Lord de Winter. He

blames me for de Winter's death.

He thinks I murdered him.

D'ARTAGNAN

Did you murder your husband,

Milady?

MILADY

What do you think?

A beat. D'Artagnan studies her pale, beautiful face.

Remembers Athos' tale of love and loss.

D'ARTAGNAN

I think he's not the first husband

you killed.

(off her look)

I once knew a man, one of the

Counts of Berry. He told me a

story... of beauty and danger.

He was the bravest man I've ever

known. And the saddest.

MILADY

I know...

The truth strikes home. Milady cannot conceal it. But

she does not react with anger or scorn. D'Artagnan has

reminded her of the one thing in the world that still

touches her heart. D'Artagnan looks at her with a steady

gaze. Milady cannot hold it, she turns to the carriage

window.

CUT TO:

110.

116   EXT. CALAIS - NIGHT                                        116

Milady's carriage turns down a steep lane that leads to

the harbor. The fog is so thick that only the masts of

the schooners can be seen, poking out of the gloom.

Their lanterns glow gloomily. The carriage comes to a

stop.

CUT TO:

117   EXT. HARBOR OF CALAIS - NIGHT                              117

The lights of the harbor are muted by low-hanging fog.

We see the outline of a ship waiting at the pier. Henri

helps Milady out of the carriage. D'Artagnan follows.

Milady's bodyguards dismount, six of them. A motley

bunch of sinister killers. They look around the pier,

ready for any encounter.

D'Artagnan takes in his surroundings.    There is a mel-

ancholy air about him.

MILADY

What's the matter, d'Artagnan?

Still hoping for your friends to

ride to the rescue?

D'ARTAGNAN

My friends are dead.

MILADY

Well. If it's any consolation,

you'll soon be joining them.

Milady's return to form does not surprise. Parker shoves

d'Artagnan toward the fog-enshrouded ship. A name can be

made out on her barnacled hull. Persephone.

CUT TO:

118   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                          118

Henri calls out to the ship, which is little more than an

outline in the fog, her boarding gangplank leading to

the soupy darkness of her deck.

HENRI

We are the Countess de Winter's

party, arrived from Paris.

Permission to come aboard.

There is no reply.    Closely guarded by Parker, d'Artagnan

strains to see.

118   CONTINUED:                                                       118

VOICE (O.S.)

Permission granted.

Milady nods to Henri. He steps up the narrow gangplank,

followed by Milady, d'Artagnan, Parker, and the six

bodyguards.

CUT TO:

119   EXT. DECK OF THE PERSEPHONE - NIGHT                              119

The deck is filled with swirling fog. Henri peers into

the gloom as he climbs aboard, followed by the others.

He addresses one of the crew, a tall figure standing

nearby.

HENRI

Take us to your captain.

The tall figure does not reply, nor does he move.        Henri

demands:

HENRI

What are you, deaf?

Henri goes to shake the man. He grabs his arm, and the

man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck.

Henri jumps back in alarm. Milady and the others react.

BODYGUARD

What is this?

Milady's Bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the

other silent silhouettes. They, like the tall figure...

are dead. The limp bodies topple at their touch. The

Bodyguards shout alarm and panic:

BODYGUARDS

Dead!   They're all dead!

PORTHOS (O.S.)

Well I certainly hope so. After

all that hard work.

That's when Porthos, and Aramis -- come swooping down

from above like avenging angels. They swing on the ends

of ropes, slicing through the air, then dropping feet

first on top of Milady's Bodyguards. D'Artagnan stands

open-mouthed, as his three friends draw their swords.

ARAMIS

(calling to him)

You look like you've seen a ghost.

(CONTINUED)

119   CONTINUED:                                                      119

D'ARTAGNAN

Two of them.

PORTHOS

Remind me to tell you the story

of horses that could fly above

raging waters. A heroic tale of

love, death, and Musketeers.

Suitable for the general public.

Porthos wades into the Bodyguards, at play, shouting as

he goes.

PORTHOS

All right then. All those who

wish to die, raise your hands!

Don't by shy, there's plenty to

go around!

D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join

the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the

Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords

spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out

of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on

the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop

d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted

on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed!

ATHOS

Sorry I'm late. Did I miss

anything?

D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness.       He leaps to his

feet and embraces Athos.

D'ARTAGNAN

I thought you were dead.

ATHOS

Keep your mind on the mission,

d'Artagnan.

He winks at d'Artagnan, returns to the fray. D'Artagnan

follows. The Musketeers confront Milady's evil Bodyguards

in the night and fog. Athos with brutal perfection.

Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the

absurd. And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry --

and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his

opponents.

Milady views the latter with alarm. As the battle rages

around her, she retreats into the shadows.

(CONTINUED)

119   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             119

Athos and d'Artagnan find themselves fighting side by

side. Athos observes d'Artagnan's technique -- the usual

frenetic windmill of feint and thrust -- with a frown.

ATHOS

Boy, it's a miracle you're still

alive fighting like that.

D'ARTAGNAN

What do you mean?

ATHOS

First, always find your enemy's

weakness. Second, take advantage

of it. Watch me.

One of the Bodyguards, who wears a wooden leg, attacks

Athos. Athos kicks the false leg out from under him,

knocks him to the deck. D'Artagnan repeats, even as he

disables his own foe.

D'ARTAGNAN

Find the weakness. Take advantage.

Got it.

Aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last

rites. A Bodyguard races INTO VIEW, means to kill him

where he kneels. Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts,

rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the

ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard. And Aramis

resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany.

120   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                             120

Two SAILORS, crew members of the Persephone, return to

the ship after a night's drunk. They see and hear the

mayhem ahead.

SAILOR

That's our ship...

The two Sailors pull out daggers, and bound up the

gangplank.

CUT TO:

121   EXT. DECK OF PERSEPHONE - NIGHT                               121

The two Sailors find themselves in the middle of a wild

battle. They look around for someone to assault, see a

large Musketeer with his back turned. They charge.

Porthos hears them coming, spins. The two Sailors stop

in their tracks, eyes popping with horrified recognition.

BOTH SAILORS

Porthos the Pirate!!

With a collective "yah!" the two Sailors drop their

daggers, and flee into the foggy night. Porthos looks

about to see if anyone noticed their exit. D'Artagnan

grins nearby.

PORTHOS

I told you I was famous.

D'ARTAGNAN

Porthos the Pirate?

PORTHOS

Privateer.   There's a difference.

Every Musketeer is running from something or someone.

D'Artagnan deadpans:

D'ARTAGNAN

I love a good sea story.     Do tell

me sometime.

Porthos reacts to d'Artagnan's jest. But before he can

reply, the youth has bolted back to the fray.

122   HIGH ANGLE                                                      122

PISTOLS EXPLODE.

Athos drives several Bodyguards back with his sword,

notices d'Artagnan working his way towards him.

ATHOS

Did you find the Cardinal's spy?

D'ARTAGNAN

Yes.

ATHOS

Did you kill him?

D'ARTAGNAN

Athos.   The spy... is a woman.

ATHOS

What?

Athos turns to d'Artagnan, wonders. And at that moment,

sees a figure at the gangplank, swathed in fog and diffuse

light. Milady. Time stops as they regard each other

across the deck, the battle between.

ATHOS

No.

Milady turns and runs into the night.    Athos races after.

124   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                             124

With the speed and grace of a panther, Milady runs down

the gangplank, climbs into the saddle of one of her

Bodyguard's horses, and gallops off. Athos appears

moments later, leaps into the saddle of another horse.

And gives chase.

CUT TO:

125   EXT. HARBOR ROAD - NIGHT                                      125

Milady whips her horse, drives it onward. But Athos

overtakes, leaps from his saddle, takes her into his arms.

They fall to the ground with a crash. Milady grabs the

deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle.

Athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his

side. Milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the half-

light. And lowers the dagger. She will not kill him.

Milady scrambles to her feet, runs toward a dark forest.

But Athos stands and shouts:

ATHOS

Stop!!

Milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him.

Athos holds his musket in a steady hand. A very long

beat. Milady takes a step closer. Finally, she whispers,

with love, with hate:

MILADY

Athos.

ATHOS

How did you do it, Sabine? How

did you come back from the dead?

MILADY

A kind gentleman took pity on me.

ATHOS

I did not.

MILADY

No, Count. You were too proud to

listen to the truth. I learned

the value of lies soon after.

Athos grips the pistol tighter, as if to ward off the

past and what it brings.

ATHOS

Give me the Cardinal's treaty.

MILADY

No.

ATHOS

Then I will shoot.

Athos cocks the trigger.     Milady whispers:

MILADY

Be kind.   And aim for my heart.

Athos' face is a mask of contradiction. He tries to pull

the trigger, but it is not in him. Milady recognizes

his pain with a nod. She feels it, too. Then, briefly,

before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly. The past,

their love, and where it led them.

MILADY

I remember... everything.

She turns and runs away... directly into the arms of

Armand de Winter. He has ridden, and he has followed,

and he has finally found her here.

ARMAND

Countess de Winter...

The public room is empty, save for d'Artagnan and the

three Musketeers. They gather around a table. Aramis

holds the treaty in his gloved hand. The mood is somber

and tense.

126   CONTINUED:                                                      126

ARAMIS

The treaty outlines Richelieu's

plan to forge an alliance with

Buckingham.

PORTHOS

What about the King?

ARAMIS

He is not mentioned directly. But

the agreement is contingent on a

'demonstration' of the Cardinal's

power.

D'ARTAGNAN

A demonstration? What does that

mean?

ARAMIS

I don't know.

Athos' face grows dark. He has been silent throughout.

Now he rises to his feet.

ATHOS

I know someone who does.

D'Artagnan, Aramis, and Porthos watch in grim silence as

Athos crosses the room to an imposing door.

CUT TO:

127   INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT                                    127

A fire burns in the grate. Milady sits beside it in a

chair, staring into the glowing embers. Their hot re-

flection dances in her pale blue eyes. There is a KNOCK

at the door. Armand de Winter emerges from a dark corner

of the room where he has been standing guard with an

impassive executioner. He crosses to the door, opens it.

And Athos steps inside.

ATHOS

I'd like a word with your

prisoner.

ARMAND

(a beat, he nods)

She dies at dawn.

Athos nods, and steps to Milady, stands before her.

Milady stares at the fire, speaks softly, her eyes on the

flames.

(CONTINUED)

118.

127   CONTINUED:                                                      127

MILADY

(quietly sardonic)

Did you come to offer me

consolation?

ATHOS

No.

Milady turns, looks up to face him.

MILADY

There was a time when I would've

given my life for a kind word.

ATHOS

I could not give it, Sabine.

I was... a fool.

Milady hears the regret in his voice, holds his gaze.

Athos indicates Armand in the corner.

ATHOS

Did you kill his brother and his

father as he says?

MILADY

(a long beat,

honest at the

last)

I have become... the nightmare

you once thought me to be.

ATHOS

But not before. Not us.

MILADY

No. The memory will keep me

company.

Athos kneels at her side, near to pleading:

ATHOS

Do you know the Cardinal's plans?

MILADY

Yes.

ATHOS

Tell me.

MILADY

Will you spare my life?

ATHOS

I can't.

MILADY

(remembering another

time, another place)

Society demands swift justice.

(off his look)

I'll take the secret to my grave.

ATHOS

Sabine. You'll die for your

crimes. Nothing can stop that.

But how you leave this world is

up to you.

Milady offers a half-smile, takes his hand in hers.

MILADY

What did the world ever do for me?

HOLD ON Athos.       Milady's hand in his.   All that he is

feeling.

CUT TO:

128   EXT. SEASIDE CLIFFS - NIGHT                                   128

A hundred feet below, waves crash on a rocky shore. On

the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined

against a stormy sky filled with copper-colored clouds,

surreal in effect. A sinister procession approaches the

cliff.

Porthos leads Milady. She wears a simple white shift,

her hair pulled back into a long braid. She looks years

younger, the girl she used to be. The Executioner walks

behind them. Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis,

d'Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every step.

The procession stops at the cliff's edge.

THUNDER RUMBLES. Lightning slashes the sky. The

Executioner ties Milady's hands behind her. The

Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his

cloak. Milady catches Athos' eye. He holds her gaze.

He stares at Milady unflinchingly, as if to burn her

image into his eyes, so that he might keep it there until

the day he dies.

Aramis reaches inside his cloak, removes the sacred

priestly cloth he carries.

(CONTINUED)

120.

128   CONTINUED:                                                       128

The Executioner delivers the formal litany:

EXECUTIONER

I forgive you for your crimes.

Die in peace.

Athos repeats, whispers:

ATHOS

Die in peace.

Aramis comes forward, intones:

ARAMIS

I am the resurrection and the

life, sayeth the Lord. He that

believeth in me, though he were

dead, yet shall he live; and

whosoever liveth and believeth

in me shall never die...

The Executioner's sharp blade shines in the light of

dawn.

EXECUTIONER

On your knees.

Milady kneels, the Executioner steps closer. The tableau

silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon. The

Executioner brushes Milady's braid from her neck,

exposing the soft white skin beneath. He raises the

scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it

down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart:

ATHOS

No.

Athos grabs the Executioner's wrist, and twists the

scimitar loose. It falls to the ground.

EXECUTIONER

What's this...?

Porthos leaps forward, locks his great arms around Athos.

PORTHOS

Athos --

But Athos breaks free.       Milady rises to her feet.   Athos

rushes to her.

ATHOS

Forgive me, Sabine.       Please

forgive.

(CONTINUED)

121.

128   CONTINUED:    (2)                                          128

MILADY

I do.

The words he could never say, finally spoken. Milady

locks eyes with him. Athos' desperate act, the pure

feeling it signifies, has given her a kind of release.

And the strength to face her fate.

MILADY

The Cardinal intends to assassinate

the King at his birthday celebration

on Friday.

And with that, Milady reaches forward, offers a gentle

kiss. Then, as Athos and the others look on, stunned,

uncertain... she takes a backward step, finds the

cliff's edge... and steps over it. The Executioner

rushes to look after. The others follow. Except for

Athos, who remains rooted in place, eyes on the

distant horizon. A long silence. THUNDER RUMBLES.

EXECUTIONER

God's justice be done.

D'Artagnan sadly lowers his head. Porthos puts a

consoling hand on his shoulder. Aramis stands to the

other side, mutters:

ARAMIS

Amen.

ATHOS

Musketeers.

D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis turn. Athos has regained

his former self. Stoic, in command. And hiding a broken

heart.

ATHOS

The King's life in danger.   We

have work to do.

129   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS DU CARDINAL (PARIS) - NIGHT            129

START CLOSE ON the now familiar portrait of King

Louis XIII, usually found hanging behind Richelieu's

desk. A SHOT RINGS OUT -- and a blast tears through

the painting, leaving a smoking hole where the King's

heart should be.

122.

130   ANOTHER ANGLE                                            130

REVEALS Richelieu and Rochefort as they walk across the

roof to the painting, appraise the damage. Thie Cardinal

pokes a long finger into the hole.

RICHELIEU

Impressive.

ROCHEFORT

He can do it every time.

Rochefort signals approval to a solitary marksman

positioned far away on one of the roof parapets. The

marksman rises from a shooter's crouch, bows curtly,

and begins to reload his musket.

RICHELIEU

And he has no qualms about...

ROCHEFORT

None. He believes that man should

honor no Kings before God.

RICHELIEU

A man of faith. How delightful.

(turns back to

the painting)

Whatever you're paying him, double

it. I want the King's birthday to

be a memorable event. And rehang

this painting in my chamber. Just

as it is.

HOLD ON Richelieu for a beat.   Framed by a sky filled

with stars. His evil intent.

132   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY                                132

D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers thunder through on

horseback. Pedestrians scurry to get out of their way.

As they ride past, Porthos raises a crossbow and fires

it. The arrow slices through the air with a terrible

hum and imbeds itself on the public wall. Attached to

the arrow is a piece of parchment, like the one in

d'Artagnan's father's study. It reads: All For One,

And One For All.

CUT TO:

123.

133   EXT. ANOTHER VILLAGE - DAY                                 133

A CAPTAIN in the Cardinal's Guard makes a public

pronouncement from horseback outside a cathedral.

Townspeople are gathered around.

CAPTAIN

... the aforenamed Musketeers are

declared outlaws and are sentenced

to death. Any person sheltering

or aiding them will be hanged --

HOOFBEATS interrupt. The Captain turns in irritation.

And Porthos and Aramis ride to either side, snatch the

man up by the arms, drag him briefly through the air,

and deposit him with a thud against a hitching post.

The Captain, stunned, looks down at the piece of

parchment now attached to his chest. All For One, And

One For All.

The citizens of Paris move through the streets. They

share a common destination, the Palace. A festive mood

is in the air. And why not, it is the King's birthday.

CUT TO:

137   INT. LOUVRE - GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY             137

A gathering of nobles and ladies, all in full ceremonial

dress. Rochefort is there as well, the familiar eye

patch, in command of the Cardinal's Guards. A Seneschal

waits at the door with two flanking lines of trumpeteers.

The trumpeteers raise their instruments and blow a royal

blast.

124.

138   ENTRANCE DOORS                                             138

Louis, Queen Anne, and their retinue enter from a

corridor, proceed slowly across the room toward the

balcony that overlooks the waiting crowd outside.

Noblemen bow, and their ladies curtsy as the King and

Queen pass. Constance, dressed for the occasion, looks

on from the sidelines, smiles. The King and Queen

proceed, two teenagers with the world at the feet.

LOUIS

They look... happy.

ANNE

Hungry, more likely.

LOUIS

Still, you were right about the

celebration. And when the Cardinal

told me how much it meant to you...

ANNE

I said nothing.

LOUIS

But... ?

ANNE

The Cardinal expressed in

confidence how much the celebration

would mean to you...

Both pause to consider the manipulation.

139   INT. ANTEROOM - DAY                                        139

Richelieu stands in an anteroom just off the procession,

he watches the King and Queen as they walk, speaks

quietly, to himself:

RICHELIEU

I'm not sure which is sadder... to

die so young. Or to die a King.

Richelieu turns from the procession. Speaks to Rochefort

who pauses in the shadowy alcove behind him.

RICHELIEU

France will not go wanting. A new

King will sit on the throne. The

true King after all...

He says it quiet fervor, the dream at long last within

reach. Then, as if to reassure:

ROCHEFORT

Yes, Your Eminence.

Rest assured, Captain. You have.

CUT TO:

140   EXT. GROUNDS OUTSIDE LOUVRE - DAY                          140

The balcony has been colorfully decorated. The crowd

focuses its attention on the empty space where the King

will soon appear. Below, the entrance to the Palace is

protected by a double line of the Cardinal's Guards,

resplendent in their crimson tunics. It would take an

army to get past them.

CUT TO:

141   EXT. NEAR LOUVRE - DAY                                     141

The streets leading to the Palace are clogged with

people, all pushing and straining to get closer.

D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers arrive on horseback,

are forced to dismount. They push through the crowd,

trying to reach the Palace, afraid that they will be too

late. Athos barks orders as they struggle forward:

ATHOS

(to d'Artagnan)

Look through the surrounding area.

We'll try to reach the King...

D'ARTAGNAN

But...?

ATHOS

Go!

Athos and the others press on. D'Artagnan, a little

disappointed to be left behind, pauses, checks the

buildings that loom overhead. Then he starts, reacts

with shock and surprise.

126.

142   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV                                            142

The bell tower of the Carmes-Deschaux monastery. A

figure moving about, dimly-viewed, but this much is

clear. The man is not a monk. And he is carrying a

musket in his hands.

143   BACK TO SCENE                                               143

D'Artagnan turns to alert the Musketeers. Too late, they

have already vanished into the throng. D'Artagnan takes

off running for the monastery.

144   BELL TOWER                                                      144

HIGH ABOVE the swelling scene. The marksman assumes a

crouching position, raises his musket, and trains it on

the empty balcony where the King is soon to appear.

CUT TO:

145   INT. LOUVRE - GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY              145

Louis and Anne continue toward the balcony. Richelieu

trails the royal couple. He nods to Rochefort in

passing. They exchange significant smiles. Anne spots

the smirk on Rochefort's face. He resumes a supplicant

pose. Anne glances back, Richelieu behind them.

ANNE

I do not trust him.

LOUIS

I'm not sure who to trust.

ANNE

Then we will discover the truth

together.

Louis likes the sound of that.     They step side by side

toward the balcony.

CUT TO:

146   INT. STEEPLE - DAY                                          146

Bell ropes, hundreds of feet long, dangle down the

vertiginous shaft. D'Artagnan races up the narrow,

circular stairs. Above him is the open trap to the bell

tower. He catches a glimpse of the marksman, back

turned, taking aim.

CUT TO:

127.

147   IN CROWD BELOW                                            147

Athos, Porthos, and Aramis push their way through the

crowd, trying desperately to reach the Palace entrance.

But the throng is impenetrable. Athos turns, wonders.

And shoots a worried look at the bell tower of the

Carmes-Deschaux, looming against the sky, as if to intuit

the danger lurking there.

CUT TO:

148   EXT. LOUVRE - BALCONY - DAY                               148

Louis and Anne lead the procession to the doors of the

balcony. The crowd roars and the TRUMPETS BLARE. The

King steps into the sunlight. The Queen follows, then

Richelieu. The three most important people in France

stand together, acknowledging the clamoring multitudes.

149   EXT. BELL TOWER - DAY                                     149

The marksman takes careful aim. The cheering down below

is like a faint whisper at this altitude. The marksman

cocks the hammer of his flinklock.

CUT TO:

150   INT. STEEPLE - DAY                                        150

D'Artagnan hears the click of the musket's hammer, and

knows he must act now. He  looks around and sees his

chance. D'Artagnan leaps  off the stairs and grabs a

handful of rope, using his weight to RING the BELL

overhead.

CUT TO:

151   EXT. BELL TOWER - DAY                                     151

The BIG BELL makes a resounding, ear-splitting CLANG --

causing the marksman's SHOT to go wild.

CUT TO:

152   EXT. LOUVRE - BALCONY - DAY                               152

The SHOT misses the King and EXPLODES INTO the WALL an

inch from his head. Louis turns to Richelieu -- sees

anger and disappointment flash on the Cardinal's face.

Just for an instant... but it is enough.

128.

153   INT./EXT. LOUVRE - DAY                                    153

Pandemonium, inside and outside the Palace. Athos,

Porthos, and Aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance,

draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of

Guards protecting the doors. The Guards cannot believe

what they are seeing. Three men against a hundred. It's

ridiculous. But then... the looks on Guards' faces begin

to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror.

154   THEIR POV                                                   154

Behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, something incredible

happens. Musketeers appear from every direction. Some

from the surrounding crowd. Some from buildings, roof-

tops. Others appear on horseback, a few disguised as

monks. And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold

tunics.

The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. The

corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos, Porthos, and

Aramis. Porthos and Aramis exchange a smile. Athos

keeps his usually dour expression. But his eyes are

charged with excitement. They raise their arms, and

face the long line of Guards. A hundred sabers flash in

the sunlight.

ATHOS

Save the King!!

The Musketeers charge.   It is a glorious sight.

CUT TO:

155   EXT. BELL TOWER - DAY                                     155

D'Artagnan scrambles up through the trapdoor, and tackles

the marksman. As the BELL CONTINUES TO CLANG, they fight

hand-to-hand. The marksman forces d'Artagnan toward the

edge of the tower. Two hundred feet to the ground below.

They remain deadlocked for a beat, the marksman inching

d'Artagnan backward, certain death behind him. And at

the last moment, d'Artagnan summons up the strength of

three -- and shoves the marksman backward with a resound-

ing kick.

The marksman stumbles, falls through the open trapdoor,

and plunges to his death.

D'Artagnan peers down the shaft. There's a faint CRASH

as the marksman hits bottom. Utilizing the bell ropes

like a fireman's pole, d'Artagnan grabs hold and slides

down into the abyss.

CUT TO:

129.

156   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                     156

Pandemonium reigns. Rochefort instructs his Guards to

close the huge door to the great hall. The members of

the King's royal court run in panicked circles, convinced

the palace is under seige. Constance pauses amid the

riot, seeks the Queen.

But Richelieu has found her first. He steps to Anne,

assumes an air of priestly innocence.

RICHELIEU

Your Majesty...

But Louis steps INTO VIEW, puts a protecting arm around

his wife, speaks stern command:

LOUIS

Leave us... alone.

That's when a loud BOOM rocks the room.

157   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             157

The great door shudders under the impact of a terrific

blow. Another BOOM and the great hall is plunged into

further chaos. The regiment of Guards rush forward,

press their bodies against the door to secure it.

BOOM -- the great door threatens to split in half.

Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic.

His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis

and Anne across the room.

RICHELIEU

(a cold whisper)

Kill him. Kill her, too.

Rochefort draws d'Artagnan's sword from its sheath. He

advances on Louis and Anne. Louis has witnessed the

latter, treason confirmed. He raises his own sword,

prepared to protect his Queen. To die for her if

necessary.

LOUIS

(to Anne)

Get behind me.

Rochefort takes confident steps toward the King. But

one last BOOM and the great DOOR comes CRASHING down on

the Guards, revealing a tide of Musketeers on the other

side. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at the lead.

(CONTINUED)

157   CONTINUED:                                                 157

Louis breaks into a wide grin. The Musketeers wade into

the Guards, and the great hall is transformed into a bat-

tlefield. Rochefort turns, sees Athos charging at him.

ATHOS

Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops.   Are

we interrupting?

ROCHEFORT

Not for long.

Athos and Rochefort lock swords and duel.

158   BATTLE                                                     158

Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack.

But the young King has no intention of being protected.

He wades to the fore, fights side by side with his

Musketeers. Anne watches him with a host of emotions.

Respect, admiration... love. Louis pauses to return her

gaze, then returns to battle.

Constance dashes through the fray. She sees a Guard

slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen. She grabs a

heavy goblet, shouts:

CONSTANCE

Look out!

Anne looks up. Constance tosses the goblet to her. Anne

catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the

hapless Guard. Constance smiles, leaps forward.

Aramis cuts down a Guard. As another man comes at him

from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through.

The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks,

and continue.

Athos and Rochefort slash at each other. It is a mighty

confrontation. But Athos soon gains the upper hand.

Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help. Now it's

two on one. Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he

staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the

floor. Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the

treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. Athos shakes off

the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard. Rochefort and

Athos face each other a second time. Athos wounded,

Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer.

But Athos merely changes sword hands. Rochefort reacts.

Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together. Rochefort

grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. But

Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the

face with his fist.

(CONTINUED)

131.

158   CONTINUED:                                                    158

Rochefort goes sprawling. He loses his sword, it slides

across the floor until someone's foot stops it.

Rochefort looks up... and sees d'Artagnan standing on

the blade.

D'ARTAGNAN

This sword belongs to me.

D'Artagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword. He

tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it

neatly. Athos watches from a short distance, knows

this moment belongs to d'Artagnan. He will not intervene.

But he shouts:

ARAMIS

D'Artagnan.   Kill him where he

stands.

These are d'Artagnan's words. A son vowing to avenge the

death of his father. D'Artagnan wonders. Rochefort

confirms.

ROCHEFORT

By all means. Let's discover if

you are as brave a man as your

father was. And as foolish.

D'ARTAGNAN

(stunned by the

revelation as it

unfolds)

What...?

ROCHEFORT

He died for his King and for

France. But most of all... he

died on the end of my sword.

(the final curse)

As will you.

Rochefort smiles a taunt.     D'Artagnan raises his sword,

whispers to heaven.

D'ARTAGNAN

This is for you, Father.

Then, eyes blazing, d'Artagnan attacks Rochefort with

everything he's got, driving him into an adjoining

chamber.

159   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHAMBER                                     159

A FIRE ROARS in a great stone hearth. Its light pro-

jects giant shadows on the wall as d'Artagnan and

Rochefort duel, slashing at each other.

132.

160   GREAT HALL                                                    160

Athos, Porthos, and Aramis take the fight to the

Cardinal's Guards. Each with his by-now familiar

tradmarks. King Louis fighting beside them.

161   D'ARTAGNAN AND ROCHEFORT                                     161

They battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their

faces. Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan

has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto.

Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He

cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a

knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the

floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But

d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his

feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent.

Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall.

He pins him there, stunning the youth. And hisses with

superior disdain:

ROCHEFORT

One thing's certain. You're no

Musketeer.

But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice. "Always find

your enemy's weakness." He shoves a thumb into

Rochefort's good eye. Rochefort stumbles backward.

D'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's

heart.

D'ARTAGNAN

Take it back...?

ROCHEFORT

I might... have been... mistaken.

Rochefort crumples to the floor, dead. D'Artagnan looks

at Rochefort's blood on his sword. His father's death

finally avenged. That's when he hears the RUSTLE of a

SILKEN ROBE. D'Artagnan pivots, sees Richelieu kneeling

at Rochefort's body... extracting the treaty from his

doublet.

D'ARTAGNAN

No!!

Richelieu smiles,   hurls the treaty into the blazing

fireplace. As the    flames begin to lick at the parchment

paper, d'Artagnan   flies past the Cardinal, and dives

after to retrieve   it.

(CONTINUED)

133.

161   CONTINUED:                                                      161

Athos, Porthos, and Aramis enter the room. D'Artagnan

stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot,

clutching the treaty. He grins. ON d'Artagnan's look

of triumph...

CUT TO:

162   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                       162

A short time later. The battle is over. The Musketeers

have won. On the dais, Louis and Anne confront Richelieu

who is a prisoner now, guarded by several Musketeers.

Louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands.

D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers stand nearby.

RICHELIEU

Your Majesty, that document is an

obvious forgery. I am clearly the

victim of a conspiracy designed

and perpetuated by these three

Musketeers.

Richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose, one familiar to

both King and Queen.

LOUIS

This is a complicated matter,

Your Eminence, affecting both

France and the crown...

A beat. As all wonder if Richelieu will manage to elude

blame after all. But Louis continues with quiet author-

ity, just a trace of humor. As King, and as a man.

LOUIS

And so, until such time as I and

my advisors --

(gestures toward

Anne; the

Musketeers)

-- can determine the whole truth

of the matter. I invite you to

await our decision in the comfort

of... the Bastille.

Musketeers close in around the Cardinal.     He fumes,

protests.

RICHELIEU

You can't do this to me.   I'm the

Cardinal of France.

(CONTINUED)

134.

162   CONTINUED:                                                         162

LOUIS

(never more certain)

And I am its King.

Shouts of "Long live the King!       Long live the King!"

LOUIS

And as King... I hereby reinstate

the Musketeers.

A tremendous cheer is heard from all. Richelieu is led

from the room. He pauses in front of d'Artagnan.

RICHELIEU

Congratulations, Monsieur

d'Artagnan. I'll be keeping an

eye on you.

D'ARTAGNAN

(unphased)

Thank you, Your Eminence.    I'll

be watching you, too.

Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by

guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind

his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him.

Louis turns to the Musketeers.       He indicates d'Artagnan.

LOUIS

Is this the young man who saved

my life?

Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.

PORTHOS

His name's d'Artagnan, Sire.

LOUIS

Approach, d'Artagnan.

D'Artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to King and

Queen. Then he remembers, reaches into his doublet. And

turns to the Queen.

D'ARTAGNAN

I have something that belongs to

... Your Majesty...

D'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country

road. He holds it out to her. The King wonders, the

Queen smiles.

(CONTINUED)

135.

162   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            162

ANNE

Thank you, d'Artagnan. But the

bracelet does not belong to me.

(off his look)

It belongs to her.

Anne indicates Constance, who steps forward, INTO VIEW.

D'Artagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time.

The thrill of recognition, the promise of romance,

charges between. D'Artagnan slips the bracelet around

her wrist. Constance kisses him on the cheek. Louis

continues:

LOUIS

D'Artagnan, I am in your debt.

What can I do to repay the courage

you've shown me? Anything,

D'Artagnan.  Whatever your heart

desires...

D'Artagnan knows what he wants. But he is tongue-tied,

unable to ask for it. Athos asks for him.

ATHOS

Majesty, his heart has only one

desire. To become a Musketeer.

D'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession.

Louis answers with pleasure.

LOUIS

Then kneel, d'Artagnan.

D'Artagnan drops to his knees. Louis lays the blade of

his sword on each of his shoulders.

LOUIS

The world is an uncertain realm,

filled with danger. Truth

despoiled by broken promises.

Honor undermined by the pursuit

of gold. Freedom sacrificed when

the weak are oppressed by the

strong. But there are those who

oppose these powerful forces.

Those who dedicate their lives to

truth, honor, and freedom. They

are a constant reminder to all of

us. That such a life is not just

possible, but necessary to our

continued survival. As a country,

as a King. These men are known as

the Musketeers...

(CONTINUED)

136.

162   CONTINUED:    (3)                                            162

As Louis speaks, D'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless

images rush through his mind. His home in Gascony,

Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first

encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their

adventures together, the face of Milady. It's been a

busy week.

LOUIS

Rise, d'Artagnan. And join them.

Musketeer.

D'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. BELLS

RING in the distance. Constance smiles brightly, tears

gleam in her eyes. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround

their young friend, and happily present him with the

bright blue tunic of the Musketeers. They slip the tunic

over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer. D'Artagnan

hugs each of the three. For each has given him gifts

more valuable than gold.

Porthos, Aramis, and last... Athos.       Who, to the surprise

of all who know him... smiles.

PORTHOS

Do my eyes deceive me?

ARAMIS

I find it hard to believe myself.

PORTHOS

His lips, unused as they are to

such a contortion, twisted and

stretched... into a smile.

ARAMIS

It was spectacular. And what

teeth.

D'Artagnan basks in their company, wonders aloud.

D'ARTAGNAN

I know this is a stupid question.

But what exactly does a Musketeer

do?

Porthos and Aramis exchange a glance.       They're not so

sure themselves.

PORTHOS

Truth... honor...

ARAMIS

(helpfully suggests

a third)

And freedom.

(CONTINUED)

137.

162   CONTINUED:    (4)                                        162

PORTHOS

Weren't you listening?

163   HIGH ANGLE                                                   163

The Three Musketeers -- no, make that the four

Musketeers -- raise their swords, and clash blades

together, causing them to give off sparks.

D'ARTAGNAN

All for one...

OTHERS

... And one for all!!

MUSIC SOARS.    The curtain falls.

FADE OUT.

THE END
