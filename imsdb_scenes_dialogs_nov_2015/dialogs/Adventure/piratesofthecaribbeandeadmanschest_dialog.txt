ELIZABETH SWANN

Will...!

ELIZABETH SWANN

Why is this happening?

WILL TURNER

I don't know. You look beautiful.

ELIZABETH SWANN

I think it's bad luck for the groom

to see the bride before the wedding.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been

too long.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

His Lord now... actually.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The

warrant for the arrest of one William

Turner.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

Arrest her.

ELIZABETH SWANN

On what charges?

WILL TURNER

No!

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Ah-ha! Here's the one for William Turner.

And I have another one for a Mister

James Norrington. Is he present?

ELIZABETH SWANN

*What are the charges?*

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

I don't believe that's the answer to

the question I asked.

WILL TURNER

Lord Beckett! In the category of questions

*not* answered...

ELIZABETH SWANN

We are under the jurisdiction of the

King's governor of Port Royal, and you

will tell us what we are charged with.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

For which the punishment, regrettably,

is *also* death. Perhaps you remember

a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.

ELIZABETH SWANN

*Captain* Jack Sparrow.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought

you might.

GIBBS

Fifteen men on a dead man's chest.

Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink

and the devil had done for the rest.

Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

JACK SPARROW

Sorry, mate.

JACK SPARROW

Mind if we make a little side trip?

I didn't think so.

GIBBS

Not *quite* according to plan.

JACK SPARROW

Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.

GIBBS

You got what you went in for, then?

JACK SPARROW

Mm-hmm!

GIBBS

Captain, I think the crew, meaning me

as well, were expecting something a

bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla

de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed

by the sea, and the treasure with it.

LEECH

And the Royal Navy chasing us all around

the Atlantic.

MARTY

And the hurricane!

CREW

Aye.

GIBBS

All in all, it's seems some time since

we did a speck of honest pirating.

JACK SPARROW

Shiny?

GIBBS

Aye, shiny.

JACK SPARROW

Is that how you're all feeling, then?

Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving

your best interests as captain?

COTTON'S PARROT

Awk! Walk the plank!

JACK SPARROW

What did the bird say?

LEECH

Do not blame the bird. Show us what

is on that piece of cloth there.

JACK SPARROW

Ohhh!

GIBBS

Know that don't do no good.

JACK SPARROW

It does me.

MARTY

It's a key!

JACK SPARROW

No! Much more better. It is a *drawing*

of a key.

Chinese man, black man with a black

beard, white bearded man with large

black hat]

JACK SPARROW

Gentlemen, what do keys do?

LEECH

Keys... unlock... *things*?

GIBBS

And whatever this key unlocks, *inside*

there's something valuable. So, we're

setting out to find whatever this key

unlocks!

JACK SPARROW

No! If we don't have the key, we can't

open whatever it is we don't have that

it unlocks. So what purpose would be

served in finding whatever need be unlocked,

which we don't have, without first having

found the key what unlocks it?

GIBBS

So - We're going after this key!

JACK SPARROW

You're not making any sense at all.

Any more questions?

MARTY

So... Do we have a heading?

JACK SPARROW

Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm...

a general... in *that* way - direction.

GIBBS

Cap'n?

JACK SPARROW

Come on, snap to and make sail, you

know how this works. Come on, ?oy/?quick,

?oy/?quick, hey!

MARTY

Have you noticed lately... The captain

seems to be actin' a bit strange...

-er.

GIBBS

Settin' sail without knowing his own

headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed.

Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack

Sparrow bodes ill for us all.

GUARD

Lord Beckett. The prisoner as ordered,

Sir.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Those won't be necessary.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

The East India Trading Company has need

of your services.  We wish for you to

act as our agent in a business transaction

with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.

WILL TURNER

More acquaintance than friend. How do

you know him?

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

We've had dealings in the past.  And

we've each left our mark... on the other.

WILL TURNER

What mark did he leave on you?

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set

free. I would like you to go to him,

and recover a certain property in his

possession.

WILL TURNER

Recover. At the point of a sword?

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

*Bargain*!

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Letters of Marque. You will offer what

amounts to a full pardon. Jack will

be free, a privateer in the employ of

England.

WILL TURNER

Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment

the same as being free.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Freedom.  Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

The world is shrinking, the blank pages

of the map filled in. Jack must find

his place in the new world or perish.

Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and

your fiancee face the hangman's noose.

WILL TURNER

So you get both Jack *and* the Black

Pearl.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

The Black Pearl?

WILL TURNER

The property you want that he possesses.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

A ship? Hardly. The item in question's

considerably smaller and far more valuable.

Something Sparrow keeps on his person

at all times. A compass.  Ah, you know

it. Bring back that Compass, or there's

no deal.

JACK SPARROW

Why is the rum always gone?

JACK SPARROW

Oh! *That's* why.

JACK SPARROW

As you were, gents.

JACK SPARROW

Ah!

JACK SPARROW

Bootstrap. Bill Turner.

JACK SPARROW

Is this a dream?

JACK SPARROW

I thought not. If it were, there'd be

rum.

JACK SPARROW

I had some help retrieving the Pearl,

by the way.

JACK SPARROW

Your son.

JACK SPARROW

And to what do I owe the pleasure of

your carbuncle?

JACK SPARROW

Who?

JACK SPARROW

Ah. So it's you, then.  He shanghaied

you into service, eh?

JACK SPARROW

It's funny what a man will do to forestall

his final judgment -

JACK SPARROW

Technic -

JACK SPARROW

Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already

*has* a captain, so there's re -

JACK SPARROW

Any idea when Jones might release said

terrible beastie?

JACK SPARROW

On deck all hands! Make fast the bunt

gasket! On deck! Scurry! ?Scurry-on/?Marty,

I want movement!

JACK SPARROW

*I want movement!*

GIBBS

Lift the skin up!

JACK SPARROW

All on deck! Run! And keep running!

Run as if the devil himself and itself

is upon us!

GIBBS

Do we have a heading?

JACK SPARROW

Ah! Ooh! Run! Land.

JACK SPARROW

Oh! Euh!

GIBBS

Which port?

JACK SPARROW

Didn't say port. I said land. Any land.

JACK SPARROW

Agh!

GIBBS

Jack's hat! Bring 'er about!

JACK SPARROW

No no! Leave it! Run!

GIBBS

Back to your stations! The lot o' ya!

GIBBS

Jack?

JACK SPARROW

Shhh!

GIBBS

For the love of mother and child, Jack,

what's coming after us?

JACK SPARROW

Nothing.

CARRUTHERS

Here now. He can't be here.

CARRUTHERS

Mister Swann, -

ELIZABETH SWANN

Jack's Compass. What does Beckett want

with that?

WILL TURNER

Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and

convince him to return to Port Royal.

In exchange the charges against us will

be dropped.

WILL TURNER

Is that lack of faith in Jack, or in

me?

ELIZABETH SWANN

I have faith in you. Both of you. Where

will you find him?

WILL TURNER

Tortuga. I'll start there, and I won't

stop searching 'til I find him. And

then I intend to return here, to marry

you.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Properly?

WILL TURNER

Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

ELIZABETH SWANN

If it weren't for these bars I'd have

you already.

ELIZABETH SWANN

I'll wait for you.

WILL TURNER

Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

WEATHERED SAILOR

*Captain* Jack Sparrow? Owes me four

dubloons. Heard he was dead.

HALF-BLIND FISHERMAN

Singapore. That's what I heard. Drunk

with a smile on his face. Sure as the

tide, Jack Sparrow... will turn up in

Singapore.

GISELLE

Jack Sparrow!

SCARLETT

I haven't seen 'im in a month.

GISELLE

When you find him, will you give him

a message?

SHRIMPER

Cannot say about Jack Sparrow. But dere's

a island, just south of de straits,

where I trade spice for... mmm... delicious

long pork. Cannot say about Jack. But

you find a ship dere. A ship wit' black

sails.

CANNIBAL ISLAND

SHRIMPER

My brother will take you ashore.

WILL TURNER

What's wrong? The beach is right there.

SHRIMPER'S BROTHER

?: Ne bougeais pas, c'est trop dangereux.

WILL TURNER

What?

SHRIMPER'S BROTHER

?: Je ne peux, c'est trop dangereux,

j'avais le dit. Bon voyage, monsieur.

WILL TURNER

Jack! Jack Sparrow!

WILL TURNER

Marty! Cotton! Anybody?

COTTON'S PARROT

Awk!

WILL TURNER

Ah! A familiar face!

COTTON'S PARROT

Rawk! Don't eat me!

WILL TURNER

I'm not gonna eat you.

COTTON'S PARROT

Don't eat me! No! Don't eat me! Akkk!

WILL TURNER

Gibbs.

WILL TURNER

Euh! Unh! Ya! Come on! Let's go! Euh!

Ya! Come on! Who wants it? Unh! I could

do this all day! Euh! Euh! Hah!

I'm glad to see you!

Tell 'em to let me down.

Kay-lay lam. Lam piki-piki. Lam eensy

CANNIBAL CROWD

Ahhh... eunuchy!

WILL TURNER

Jack! The Compass! That's all I need,

Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested

for trying to help *you*. She faces

the gallows!

CANNIBAL CROWD

JACK SPARROW

Save me!

WILL TURNER

Jack, what did you tell them? No! What

about Elizabeth? *Jack...!*

PRISONERS

...we don't bite...Come on...

] Prisoners: Where you goin'...?)

ELIZABETH SWANN

Why don't you tell me what's happening?

ELIZABETH SWANN

No! Will has gone to find Jack!

ELIZABETH SWANN

He's a better man than you give him

credit for.

ELIZABETH SWANN

A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.

MERCER

Evening, Governor.  Shame, huh? He was

carryin' this. It's a letter to the

King. It's from *you*.

MERCER

Where is she?

PORT ROYAL

EITC headquarters

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

No doubt you've discovered that loyalty

is no longer the currency of the realm,

as your father believes.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Then what is?

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency

of the realm.

ELIZABETH SWANN

I expect then that we can come to some

sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

I'm listening.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

I'm listening *intently*.

ELIZABETH SWANN

These Letters of Marque, they are signed

by the King?

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Yes, and they're not valid until they

bear my signature and my seal.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Or else I would not still be here. You

sent Will to get you the Compass owned

by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Do explain.

ELIZABETH SWANN

I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have

seen the treasure myself. There is something

you need to know.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Ah, I see. *You* think the Compass leads

only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you

hope to *save* me from an evil fate.

But you mustn't worry. I care not for

cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not

so provincial. There's more than one

chest of value in these waters. So perhaps

you may wish to enhance your offer.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Consider into your calculations that

you robbed me of my wedding night.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

So I did. A marriage interrupted.  Or

fate intervenes. You make great efforts

to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

ELIZABETH SWANN

These aren't going to Jack.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's

freedom, then? I'll still want that

Compass. Consider that in your calculations.

RAGETTI

Well I say it was divine providence

what escaped us from jail.

PINTEL

And I say... it was me bein' *clever*.

Ain't that right, poochie?

RAGETTI

?: Well how'dya know it ?weren't/?wasn't

divine providence what inspired you

to *be* clever? Anyways, I ain't stealin'

no ship.

PINTEL

It ain't stealin'. It's *salvagin'*!

And since when did you care?

RAGETTI

Since we're not immortal no more. We

gotta take care of our immortal souls.

PINTEL

You know you can't read.

RAGETTI

It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

PINTEL

Pretendin' to read the Bible's a *lie*!

*That's* a mark against ya!  Look! There

it is!

RAGETTI

What's got into *'im*?

PINTEL

Must've seen a catfish. Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.

RAGETTI

Stupid mongrel!

CANNIBAL ISLAND

PINTEL

Come on! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha...

###

PINTEL

It's ours for the taking!

RAGETTI

Tide's comin', that should help. Well,

salvagin' is saving, in a manner of

speaking.

PINTEL

There's the truth of *it*! ###

RAGETTI

Suppose we be'er... save it as soon

as we can. What with our souls in such

a vulnerable state, and all.

PINTEL

Amen to that.

JACK SPARROW

Thank you.

cages

WILL TURNER

Why would he do this to us? If Jack

is their chief.

GIBBS

Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their

chief. But he only remains chief as

long as he *acts* like a chief.

WILL TURNER

So he had no choice. He's a captive

then as much as the rest of us.

GIBBS

Worse... as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos

believe that Jack is a *god* in human

form, and they intend to do him the

honor of releasing him from his fleshy

prison.

GIBBS

?Argh! They'll roast him and eat him.

WILL TURNER

Where's the rest of the crew?

GIBBS

These cages we're in... weren't built

'til *after* we got here.

GIBBS

The feast is about to begin. Jack's

life will end... when the drums stop.

WILL TURNER

Well, we can't just sit here and wait

then, can we?

JACK SPARROW

Hey!

Time to go.

*Cast off those lines!*

JACK SPARROW

Good doggie! ?Doggie.

JACK SPARROW

*Alas*, my children! This is the day

you shall always remember as the day

that you almost -

JACK SPARROW

...Captain Jack... Sparrow.

GIBBS

Let's put some distance between us and

this island, and head out to open sea.

JACK SPARROW

Yes to the first, yes to the second,

but only insofar as we keep to the shallows

as much as possible.

GIBBS

Uh, that seems a bit contradictory,

Captain.

JACK SPARROW

I have every faith in your reconciliatory

navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now

where is that monkey? I want to shoot

*something*.

WILL TURNER

Jack.

JACK SPARROW

Ah.

WILL TURNER

Elizabeth is in danger.

JACK SPARROW

Have you considered keeping a more watchful

eye on 'er? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.

WILL TURNER

She *is* locked up, in a prison, bound

to hang for helping *you*!

JACK SPARROW

There comes a time when one must take

responsibility for one's mistakes.

WILL TURNER

I need that Compass of yours, Jack.

I must trade it for her freedom.

JACK SPARROW

Mister Gibbs!

GIBBS

Cap'n.

JACK SPARROW

We have a need to travel upriver.

GIBBS

By need, d'you mean a... trifling need,

?uh/?a... fleeting, as in say in a passing

fancy?

JACK SPARROW

No, a... resolute and unyielding need.

WILL TURNER

What we need to do is make sail for

Port Royal with all haste.

JACK SPARROW

William... I shall trade you the Compass,

if you will help me... to find *this*.

WILL TURNER

You want me to find this?

JACK SPARROW

No. *You* want you to find this. Because

the finding this finds you incapacitorially

finding and/or locating and your discovering

the detecting of a way to save your

?dolly/?dotty belle ol'... what's-her-face.

Savvy?

WILL TURNER

This... is going to save Elizabeth?

JACK SPARROW

How much do you know about Davy Jones?

WILL TURNER

Not much.

JACK SPARROW

Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.

BELLAMY

What's all this? If you both fancy the

dress, you'll just have to share, and

wear it one after the other.

BURSAR

It's not like that, Sir. This ship is

haunted.

BELLAMY

Is it now? 'N' you?

QUARTERMASTER

The... female presence... amongst us,

yes... all the men... they can feel

it.

BURSAR

I say... that we throw the dress overboard,

and we hope the spirit finds it.

QUARTERMASTER

No! That - that will just anger the

spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find

out what the spirit needs, and then

just get it back!

BELLAMY

Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious

goats and it's got the best of you.

Now this appears to be no more as we

have a stowaway aboard. A young woman,

by the look of it. I want you to search

the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh...

she's probably naked.

WILL TURNER

Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

GIBBS

Well, if you believe such things, there's

a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones.

A fearsome creature with giant tentacles

that suction your face clean off. And

drag an entire ship past the crushing

darkness. The Kraken!

GIBBS

They say the stench of its breath is

like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing

you know on God's green earth is the

roar of the Kraken, and the reeking

odor of a thousand rotting corpses.

If you believe such things.

WILL TURNER

And the key will spare him that?

GIBBS

Now that's the very question Jack wants

answered. Bad enough even to go visit...

*Her*.

WILL TURNER

Her?

GIBBS

Aye.

BAYOU

Tia's shack

JACK SPARROW

No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go

way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable

we are. Were. Have been. Before.

GIBBS

I'll watch your back.

JACK SPARROW

It's me front I'm worried about. Mind

the boat.

GIBBS

Mind the boat.

?WILL TURNER

Mind the boat.

PINTEL

Mind the boat.

MARTY

Mind the boat.

COTTON'S PARROT

Awk! Mind the boat!

TIA DALMA

Jack Sparrow!

JACK SPARROW

Tia Dalma!

TIA DALMA

I always know de wind was goin' blow

you back to me one day.

TIA DALMA

You. You have a touch of... destiny

about *you*, William Turner.

WILL TURNER

You know me?

TIA DALMA

You want to know *me*.

JACK SPARROW

There'll be no knowing here. We've come

for help and we're not leaving without

it.

JACK SPARROW

I thought *I* knew you.

TIA DALMA

Not so well as I had hoped. Come.

JACK SPARROW

Come.

TIA DALMA

What... service... may I do you? Hmmm?

You know I demand payment.

JACK SPARROW

I brought payment.

JACK SPARROW

Look!

JACK SPARROW

An undead monkey! Top that!

GIBBS

No! You've no idea how long it took

us to catch that.

TIA DALMA

The payment is fair.

JACK SPARROW

We're looking for this.  And what it

goes to.

TIA DALMA

The Compass you bartered from me. It

cannot lead you to dis?

JACK SPARROW

Maybe. Why?

TIA DALMA

Ayeee... Jack Sparrow does not know

what he wants! Or... do know, but are

loathe to claim it as your own. Your

key go to a chest, and it is what lay

inside the chest you seek, don't it?

GIBBS

What *is* inside?

PINTEL

Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of

a valuable nature?

RAGETTI

Nothing... bad, I hope.

TIA DALMA

You know of... Davy Jones, yes? A man

of de sea. A great sailor, until he

ran afoul of dat which vex all men.

WILL TURNER

What vexes all men?

TIA DALMA

What, indeed.

GIBBS

The sea?

PINTEL

Sums!

RAGETTI

Dichotomy of good and evil.

JACK SPARROW

A *woman*.

TIA DALMA

A wo-*man*. He fell in love.

GIBBS

No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea*

he fell in love with.

TIA DALMA

Same story, different versions, and

all are true. See, it was a *woman*,

as changing, and harsh, and untamable

as the sea. Him never stopped loving

her. But the pain it cause 'im was too

much to live wid. But not enough to

cause him to die.

WILL TURNER

What... exactly did he put into the

chest?

TIA DALMA

Him heart.

RAGETTI

Literally, or figuratively?

PINTEL

He couldn't li'erally put his heart

in a chest!  Could he?

TIA DALMA

It was not wort' feeling what... small

fleeting joy life brings, and so...

he carved out him heart, lock it away

in a chest, and hide de chest from de

world. De keys, he keep wid him at all

times.

WILL TURNER

You knew this.

JACK SPARROW

I did not. I didn't know where the key

was. But now we do. So all that's left

is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman,

grab the key, you go back to Port Royal

and save your bonnie lass, hey!

TIA DALMA

Let me see your hand.

GIBBS

Uhhh! The black spot!

JACK SPARROW

My eyesight's as good as ever, just

so you know.

TIA DALMA

I am justMy little ###, where

are you? ###

TIA DALMA

Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot

step on land but once every ten years.

Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow.

And so you will carry land wid you...

JACK SPARROW

Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.

TIA DALMA

Yes?

JACK SPARROW

Is the... jar of dirt going to help?

TIA DALMA

If you don' want it, give it back.

JACK SPARROW

No.

TIA DALMA

Den it helps.

WILL TURNER

It seems... we have a need to find the

Flying Dutchman.

TIA DALMA

A touch... of destiny!

WILL TURNER

That's the Flying Dutchman? She doesn't

look like much.

JACK SPARROW

Neither do you. Do *not* underestimate

her.

GIBBS

Must've run afoul of the reef.

JACK SPARROW

So what's your plan, then?

WILL TURNER

I row over, search the ship until I

find your bloody key.

JACK SPARROW

And if there are crewmen?

WILL TURNER

I cut down anyone in my path.

JACK SPARROW

I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

RAGETTI

Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha,

ha-ha!

JACK SPARROW

Hey! If you *do* happen to get captured,

just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle

his debt! Might save your life!

RAGETTI

Bon voyage! Ha-ha-ha!

JACK SPARROW

Douse the lamps.

WILL TURNER

There's no use. You've run aground.

WOUNDED SAILOR

No! Beneath us! Foul breath!

WILL TURNER

Hey! Hey!

GREENBEARD

Down on your marrowbones, and pray.

WILL TURNER

Get back! Back!

SCUTTLED SHIP

after attack

MACCUS

Five men still alive. The rest have

moved on.

DAVY JONES

Do you fear death?  Do you fear that

dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare.

All your sins punished.  I can offer

you... an escape-uh.

CHAPLAIN

Don't listen to him!

DAVY JONES

Do you not fear death?

CHAPLAIN

I'll take my chances, Sir.

DAVY JONES

To the depths.

DAVY JONES

Life is cruel.  Why should the afterlife

be any *different*? I offer you a choice.

Join my crew, and postpone the judgment.

One hundred years before the mast. Will

ye serve?

HELMSMAN

I - I will, serve.

DAVY JONES

?Grand.

DAVY JONES

*You* are neither dead nor dying. What

is your purpose here?

WILL TURNER

Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his

debt.

DAVY JONES

What is your purpose here?

WILL TURNER

Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his

debt.

DAVY JONES

Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted

to accept that offer.

JACK SPARROW

Oh.

DAVY JONES

You have a debt to pay. You've been

captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen

years. *That* was our agreement.

JACK SPARROW

Technically, I was only captain for

two years, then I was viciously mutinied

upon.

DAVY JONES

Then you were a poor captain, but a

*captain* nonetheless! Have you not

introduced yourself all these years

as *Captain* Jack Sparrow?

JACK SPARROW

You have my payment. One soul to serve

on your ship is already over there.

DAVY JONES

One soul is not equal to another.

JACK SPARROW

Aha! So we've established my proposal

is sound in principle, now we're just

haggling over price.

DAVY JONES

Price? Pttt!

JACK SPARROW

Just how many souls do you think my

soul is worth?

DAVY JONES

One hundred souls, three days-uh.

JACK SPARROW

You're a diamond, mate. Send me back

the boy, I'll get started right off.

DAVY JONES

I keep the boy. A good-faith payment.

That leaves you only ninety-nine more

to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!

JACK SPARROW

Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble,

heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at

least four... maybe three and a half.

And did I happen to mention... he's

in love. With a girl. Due to be married.

Betrothed.  Dividing him from her and

her from him... would only be half as

cruel as actually allowing them be joined

in holy matrimony. Aye?

DAVY JONES

I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh.

But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live

with this? Can you condemn an innocent

man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of

servitude, in your name while you roam

free?

JACK SPARROW

Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal

it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?

JACK SPARROW

Uh!

DAVY JONES

Three days.  Three days.

JACK SPARROW

Oh, Mr. Gibbs.

GIBBS

Aye.

JACK SPARROW

Uh, I feel sullied and unusual.

GIBBS

And how do you intend to harvest these

ninety-nine souls in three days?

JACK SPARROW

Fortunately, he was mum as the condition

in which these souls need be.

GIBBS

Ah... Tortuga!

JACK SPARROW

Tortuga.

BELLAMY

It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing

fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help

us, pilotage. Are we all to work for

the East India Trading Company, then?

QUARTERMASTER

I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only

free port left in these waters.

BELLAMY

A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well,

I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what

I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep

well each night, thank you.

BURSAR

S-S-Sir!

BURSAR

She wants you to... do something.

BELLAMY

She's tryna give a sign.

BELLAMY

Over there! Look for a sign!

QUARTERMASTER

Look there! There it is. There's the

sign.

?BURSAR

That's seaweed.

QUARTERMASTER

S-Seaweed can be a sign.

?BURSAR

Looks like entrails.

ELIZABETH SWANN

What's that over there?

GIBBS

And what makes you think you're worthy

to crew the Black Pearl?

ELDERLY MAN

Truth be told, I never sailed a day

in me life. I figure I should get out

and see the world while I'm still young.

GIBBS

You'll do. Make your mark. Next!

JILTED MAN

My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm

drunk for a month. And I don't give

a ass rat's if I live or die.

GIBBS

Perfect! Next!

ONE-ARMED MAN

Me have one arm, 'n' a bum leg.

GIBBS

It's the crow's nest for you.

JACK SPARROW

I know what I want.

GIBBS

Next!

ROMANTIC MAN

Ever since I was a little lad, I've

always wanted to sail the seas. Forever.

GIBBS

Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.

ROMANTIC MAN

Thanks very much.

JACK SPARROW

How we going?

GIBBS

Including those four? That gives us

- four!

GIBBS

And what's *your* story?

NORRINGTON

My story... it's exactly the same as

your story, just one chapter behind.

I chased a man across the Seven Seas.

The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission,

and my life.

GIBBS

Commodore?

NORRINGTON

No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*?

I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I

would have, if not for the... hurricane.

GIBBS

Lord. You didn't try to sail through

it?

NORRINGTON

So do I make your crew, or not? You

haven't said where you're going. Somewhere

*nice*!

NORRINGTON

So am I *worthy* to serve under Captain

Jack Sparrow?

NORRINGTON

Or should I just kill you now?

JACK SPARROW

You're hired.

NORRINGTON

Sorry. Old habits and all that.

JACK SPARROW

Time to go?

GIBBS

Aye!

JACK SPARROW

Thanks, mate.

JACK SPARROW

Carry on.

NORRINGTON

Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an

orderly line, I'll have you all one

by one. Come on, who's first?

ELIZABETH SWANN

I just wanted the pleasure of doing

that myself!

ELIZABETH SWANN

James Norrington.  What has the world

done to you?

BO'SUN

Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner!

BO'SUN

Step ?to-it/?tight!

WILL TURNER

Step aside!

BO'SUN

?Regain-?yourselves!/?Mind-?yourself!

BO'SUN

Haul that weevil to his feet!

BO'SUN

Five lashes to remind you... to stay

on 'em!

BO'SUN

Impeding me in my duties. You'll share

the punishment.

DAVY JONES

Will you now? And what would prompt

such an act of charity?

DAVY JONES

Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous

circumstance be this! Five lashes be

owed. I believe it is.

DAVY JONES

The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner.

Your issue will feel its sting be it

the Bo'sun's hand, by your own.

DAVY JONES

Bo'sun!

BO'SUN

You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha!

WILL TURNER

I don't need your help!

WILL TURNER

So I'm to understand what *you* did

was an act of compassion?

FLYING DUTCHMAN

below deck

WILL TURNER

I've sworn no oath.

WILL TURNER

Not until I find this. The key.

WYVERN

The deadman's chest.

WILL TURNER

What do you know of this?

WYVERN

Open the chest with the key, and stab

the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the

heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart,

or there'll be no captain. And if there's

no captain, there's no one to have the

key.

WILL TURNER

So the captain has the key.

WILL TURNER

Where *is* the key?

WYVERN

Hidden.

WILL TURNER

Where is the chest?

WYVERN

Hidden.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Captain Sparrow!

JACK SPARROW

Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.

ELIZABETH SWANN

I'm here to find the man I love.

JACK SPARROW

I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first

and only love is the sea.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.

JACK SPARROW

Elizabeth.  Hide the rum.

JACK SPARROW

You know, these clothes do not flatter

you at all. It should be a dress or

nothing. I happen to have no dress in

my cabin.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Jack. I know Will came to find you.

Where is he?

JACK SPARROW

Darling, I am truly unhappy to have

to tell you this but... through an unfortunate

and *entirely* unforeseeable series

of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever

to do with me, poor William has been

press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Davy Jones?

NORRINGTON

Oh, please. The captain of the Flying

Dutchman.

JACK SPARROW

You look bloody awful. What are you

doing here?

NORRINGTON

You *hired* me. I can't help it if your

standards are lax.

JACK SPARROW

You *smell* funny.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Jack. All I want is to find Will.

JACK SPARROW

Are you certain? Is that what you really

want most?

ELIZABETH SWANN

'Course.

JACK SPARROW

Because I would think, you'd want to

find a way to *save* Will the most.

ELIZABETH SWANN

And you have a way of doing that?

JACK SPARROW

Well, there is a chest...

NORRINGTON

Oh, dear.

JACK SPARROW

A chest of unknown size and origin.

PINTEL

What contains the still-beating heart

o' Davy Jones.

RAGETTI

Unh-unh... unh-unh... unh-unh...

JACK SPARROW

And whoever possesses that chest possesses

the leverage to command Jones to do

whatever it is he or she wants, including...

saving brave William from his grim fate.

NORRINGTON

You don't actually believe him, do you?

ELIZABETH SWANN

How do we find it?

JACK SPARROW

With this. My Compass... is unique.

NORRINGTON

"Unique" here having the meaning of

broken.

JACK SPARROW

True enough. This Compass does not point

north.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Where does it point?

JACK SPARROW

It points to the thing you want most

in this world.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth?

JACK SPARROW

Every word, love. And what you want

most in this world is to find the chest

of Davy Jones, is it not?

ELIZABETH SWANN

To save Will?

JACK SPARROW

By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

JACK SPARROW

Mister Gibbs!

GIBBS

Cap'n.

JACK SPARROW

We have our heading.

GIBBS

Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh

anchor, and prow that canvas!

PORT ROYAL

EITC headquarters

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

There's something to knowing the exact

shape of the world and one's place in

it, don't you agree?

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

I had you brought here because I thought

you'd be interested in the whereabouts

of your daughter.

MERCER

Most recently seen on the island of

Tortuga, then left, in the company of

a known pirate, Jack Sparrow. *And*

other fugitives from justice.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Including the previous owner of this

sword...  I believe. Our ships are in

pursuit. and justice will be dispensed

by cannonade and cutlass,  and all manner

of remorseless pieces of metal. I personally

find it distasteful to even contemplate

the horror facing all those on board.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Your authority as governor, your influence

in London, and your loyalty to the East

India Trading Company.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Shall I remove these shackles?

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

So you see, Mercer, every man has a

price he will willingly accept. Even

for what he hopes never to sell.

FLYING DUTCHMAN

MACCUS

I wager... ten years.

?KOLENIKO

I'll match ten years.

GREENBEARD

Agreed.

WILL TURNER

I understand.

Liar!)

WILL TURNER

It's a game of deception. Your bet includes

all the dice, not just your own.

WILL TURNER

What are they wagering?

WILL TURNER

So any crewman can be challenged?

WILL TURNER

I challenge Davy Jones.

DAVY JONES

I accept ?that-uh.

DAVY JONES

The stakes?

WILL TURNER

My soul. An eternity of servitude.

DAVY JONES

Against?

WILL TURNER

I want this.

DAVY JONES

How do you know of the key?

WILL TURNER

That's not part of the game, is it?

You can still walk away.

DAVY JONES

What's this?

WILL TURNER

No! Don't do this.

DAVY JONES

Four fours.

WILL TURNER

Four fives.

DAVY JONES

Seven fives-uh.

WILL TURNER

Eight fives.

DAVY JONES

Huh huh huh. Welcome to the crew, liar.

DAVY JONES

And be called a liar myself for my trouble?

Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you

will spend an eternity on this ship!

Master Turner, feel free to go ashore...

the very next time we make port!

WILL TURNER

Fool. Why did you do that?

WILL TURNER

It was never about winning, or losing.

WILL TURNER

It's not a fate you had to choose for

yourself, either.

WILL TURNER

They'll know you helped me.

WILL TURNER

I take this with a promise. I'll find

a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And

not rest until this blade pierces his

heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.

GIBBS

Beckett!

ELIZABETH SWANN

Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett

of the East India Trading Company.

JACK SPARROW

Agh.

GIBBS

Will was working for Beckett, and never

said a word.

JACK SPARROW

Agh.

GIBBS

Beckett wants the Compass. Only one

reason for that.

JACK SPARROW

Of course. He wants the chest.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Yes, he did say something about a chest.

GIBBS

If the company controls the chest, they

controls the sea.

JACK SPARROW

A truly discomforting notion, love.

GIBBS

And bad. Bad for every mother's son

what calls himself a pirate. I think

there's a bit more speed to be coaxed

from these sails. Brace the foreyard!

JACK SPARROW

Might I inquire how as to how you came

by these?

ELIZABETH SWANN

Persuasion.

JACK SPARROW

Friendly?

ELIZABETH SWANN

Decidedly not.

JACK SPARROW

Will strikes a deal for these and upholds

it with honor. Yet you're the one standing

here with the prize. Full pardon, commission

as a privateer on behalf of England

and the East India Trading Company.

As if I could be bought for such a low

price.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Jack, the Letters, give them back.

JACK SPARROW

No. Persuade me.

ELIZABETH SWANN

You do know Will taught me how handle

a sword.

JACK SPARROW

As I said... Persuade me.

NORRINGTON

It's a curious thing. There was a time

when I would've given anything for you

to look like that while thinking about

me.

ELIZABETH SWANN

I don't know what you mean.

NORRINGTON

Oh, I think you do.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's

all.

NORRINGTON

So you never wondered how your *latest*

fiance ended up on the Flying Dutchman

in the first place?

BELLAMY

Strange thing to come upon a longboat

so far out in open waters.

WILL TURNER

Just put as many leagues behind us as

you can. As fast as you can.

BELLAMY

And what are we running from?

WILL TURNER

That dress. Where did you get it?

BELLAMY

It was found aboard the ship. The crew

it thought it was a spirit bringing

some omen of ill fate.

WILL TURNER

That's foolish.

QUARTERMASTER

Oh, yes. ?Proceededly foolish.

BURSAR

It brought good fortune! The spirit

told us... Put in at Tortuga. And we

made a nice bit of profit there.

?BELLAMY

Off the books, of course.

WILL TURNER

I imagine... some of your crew may have

jumped ship there.

BELLAMY

Why do you ask?

MESSENGER SAILOR

Captain, a ship's been spotted.

BELLAMY

Colors?

MESSENGER SAILOR

She isn't flyin' any.

BELLAMY

I've doomed us all.  It's the Flying

Dutchman!

Oh, Mother Cary's chickens. What happened?

Must've hit a reef.

Free the rudder! Hard to port, then

You need time alone with your thoughts.

What of the survivors?

DAVY JONES

There are no survivors.

DAVY JONES

The chest is no longer safe. Chart a

course to Isla Cruces. Get me there

first, or there'll be the devil to pay.

KOLENIKO

First?

DAVY JONES

Who sent that thieving charlatan onto

my ship? Who told them of the key? Jack

Sparrow.

JACK SPARROW

My tremendous intuitive sense of the

female creature informs me that you

are troubled.

ELIZABETH SWANN

I just thought I'd be married by now.

I'm so ready to be married.

JACK SPARROW

You know...  Lizzy... I *am*... captain

of a ship. And *being* captain of a

ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage.

Right here. Right on this deck. Right...

*now*!

ELIZABETH SWANN

No, thank you.

JACK SPARROW

Why not? We *are* very much alike, you

and I. I and you. Us.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Oh. Except for a sense of honor, and

decency and-and a moral center. And

personal hygiene.

JACK SPARROW

Trifles. You *will* come over to my

side, I know it.

ELIZABETH SWANN

You seem very certain.

JACK SPARROW

One word love: curiosity. You long for

freedom. You long to do what you want

to do because you want it. To act on

selfish impulse. You want to see what

it's like. One day, you won't be able

to resist.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Why doesn't your Compass work?

JACK SPARROW

Uh my Compass works fine.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Because you and I *are* alike, and there

will come a moment when you have a chance

to show it. To do the right thing.

JACK SPARROW

I *love* those moments. I like to wave

at them as they pass by.

ELIZABETH SWANN

You'll have the chance to do something...

something courageous. And when you do,

you'll discover something: that you're

a good man.

JACK SPARROW

All evidence to the contrary.

ELIZABETH SWANN

I have faith in you. Want to know why?

JACK SPARROW

Do tell, dearie.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Curiosity. You're going to want it.

A chance to be admired. And gain the

rewards that follow. You won't be able

to resist. You're going to want to know...

what it tastes like.

JACK SPARROW

I *do* want to know what it tastes like.

ELIZABETH SWANN

But - seeing as you're a good man I

know you will *never* put me in a position

that would compromise my honor.

ELIZABETH SWANN

I'm proud of you, Jack.

You're pulling too slow. We don't want

I'm savin' me strength for when it comes.

And I don't think it's Krack-en, anyways.

I always heard it said Kray-kin.

RAGETTI

What, with a long A?

PINTEL

Aye.

RAGETTI

No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en's how

it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian,

Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped

Not so easy, is it?

But I do owe you thanks, Jack.

Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.

Pretty much. Time and tide, love.

terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now.

If you please: The key.

I keep the promises I make, Jack. I

intend to free my father. I hope you're

here to see it.

NORRINGTON

I can't let you do that, either. So

sorry.

Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise

*with* the wind...

WILL TURNER

We rob her advantage.

GIBBS

Ah!

DAVY JONES

They're out of range! ?Break ?out

?run ###

?MARTY

They're giving up! Yay!

WILL TURNER

My father is *on* that ship. If we

can outrun her, we can take her. We

should turn and fight.

JACK SPARROW

Why fight when you can negotiate? All

one needs... is the proper leverage.

JACK SPARROW

Where is it? Where is the thump-thump?

WILL TURNER

No. It's not a reef! Get away from the

rail!

ELIZABETH SWANN

What is it?

WILL TURNER

The Kraken. To arms!

?GIBBS

All guns, defend the masts!

WILL TURNER

?It'll ?attack the starboard. I've seen

it before. ?Break out the cannons and

hold for my signal.

WILL TURNER

Easy, boys!

ELIZABETH SWANN

Will?

WILL TURNER

Steady! Steady.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Will?

WILL TURNER

Hold. Hold...

PINTEL

I think we've held fire long enough.

ELIZABETH SWANN

*Will?*

WILL TURNER

*Fire...*!

WILL TURNER

It'll be back. We have to get off the

ship.

ELIZABETH SWANN

There's no boats.

WILL TURNER

Pull the grates! Get all the gunpowder

onto the net in the cargo hold.

WILL TURNER

Whatever you do, don't miss.

ELIZABETH SWANN

As soon as you're clear.

GIBBS

There's only half a dozen kegs of powder!

WILL TURNER

Then load the rum!

GIBBS

Aye! The rum, too!

ELIZABETH SWANN

Step to!

ELIZABETH SWANN

Oh you coward!

MARTY

Not good.

WILL TURNER

?Pull ?away!

GIBBS

Heave! Heave like you're being paid

for it!

WILL TURNER

Euh! Come on!I'm over here! Come

on!

WILL TURNER

Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

MARTY

Did we kill it?

GIBBS

No. We just made it angry. We're not

out of this yet. Captain! Orders!

JACK SPARROW

Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

GIBBS

Jack! The Pearl!

JACK SPARROW

She's only a ship, mate.

ELIZABETH SWANN

He's right, we have to head for land.

PINTEL

'S a lot o' open wa'er.

RAGETTI

That's a lot o' wa'er.

WILL TURNER

We have to try. We can get away as it

takes down the Pearl.

GIBBS

Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon

hope.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Thank you, Jack.

JACK SPARROW

We're not free yet, love.

ELIZABETH SWANN

You came back. I always knew you were

a good man.

GIBBS

Prepare to cast off! There's no time

to lose! Come on, Will, step to!

ELIZABETH SWANN

It's after you, not the ship. It's not

us. This is the only way, don't you

see? I'm not sorry.

JACK SPARROW

Pirate.

WILL TURNER

Where's Jack?

ELIZABETH SWANN

He elected to stay behind to give us

a chance.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Go!

JACK SPARROW

Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger,

bugger...!

JACK SPARROW

Come on... Come on...

JACK SPARROW

Not so bad.

JACK SPARROW

Oh!

JACK SPARROW

Hello, beastie.

DAVY JONES

Jack Sparrow. Our debt is settled.

KOLENIKO

The captain goes down with his ship.

MACCUS

Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can

best the devil.

DAVY JONES

Open the chest. Open the chest, I need

to see it!

DAVY JONES

Damn you, Jack Spar-*row*!

EITC headquarters

MERCER

The last of our ships has returned.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

Is there any news on the chest?

MERCER

None. But... one of the ships did pick

up a man adrift at sea. He had these.

NORRINGTON

I took the liberty of filling in my

name.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT

If you intend to claim these, then you

must have something to trade. D'you

have the Compass?

NORRINGTON

Better.  The heart of Davy Jones.

Against de cold... and de sorrow.

TIA DALMA

It's a shame. I know you're t'inking

that wid the Pearl, you coulda captured

the devil and set free your fadder's

soul.

WILL TURNER

Doesn't matter now. The Pearl's gone.

Along with its captain.

GIBBS

Aye. And already the world seems a bit

less bright. He fooled us all right

to the end. But I guess that honest

streak finally won out. To Jack Sparrow!

RAGETTI

Never another like Captain Jack.

PINTEL

He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

ELIZABETH SWANN

He was a good man.

WILL TURNER

If there was anything could be done

to bring him back...  Elizabeth...

TIA DALMA

Would you do it? Hmmm?  What... would

you? Hmmm? What would *any* of you be

willing to do? Hmmm? Would you sail

to the ends of the eart', and beyond,

to fetch back ?witty Jack and 'im precious

Pearl?

GIBBS

Aye.

PINTEL

Aye.

RAGETTI

Aye.

COTTON'S PARROT

Awk! Aye.

ELIZABETH SWANN

Yes.

WILL TURNER

Aye.

TIA DALMA

Alright. But if you're goin' brave de

weird, and haunted shores, at world's

end, den... you will need a captain

who knows dose waters.

BARBOSSA

So tell me, what's become of my ship?
