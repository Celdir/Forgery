a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Garden of Life

A Screenplay by

Chris Columbus

FIRST DRAFT

2/10/95

MACGOWAN (O.S.)

Doctor Jones!... Doctor Jones !...

MACGOWAN

We need your assistance!

INDIANA

(struggling with the

fishing line)

C'mon, Mac... It's the first bite

I've had all week...

MACGOWAN

Please... It's very importantl...

INDIANA

Do you value our friendship, Mac?

MACGOWAN

More than me' nightly pint.

INDIANA

Then this better not be some wild

goose chase...

MACGOWAN

T'ain't wild geese we're after,

Doctor Jones. You got me' word on

that...

(sincere)

...and a MacGowan's word is truer

than an angel's kiss!

YOUNG MAN

Scotty Ferguson.

OLD WOMAN

He's the eighth.

MAN

Just like the others...all his bones

busted...crushed...

OLD MAN

Whatever's killin' people around

here ain't human.

WOMAN

(pointing OFFSCREEN)

It's there! Again!

MACGOWAN

That light...only burns after a

murder's been committed.

INDIANA

(nods, turning toward

the castle)

Let's go.

MACGOWAN

Well... Ahmmmm...that is what we're

here for...eh, men?...ah...

(points to men)

Hennesey... Galbraith...

Bottomley... You're comin' with us.

ELDERLY WOMAN

May God help them.

CUT TO:

HENNESEY

It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could

a human bein' survive?...

INDIANA

This guy's got one hell of an ego.

MACGOWAN

Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say

'e walks the moors every midnight...

others claim e's been dead for

years...

MACGOWAN

Hennesey?... Hennesey?...

GALBRAITH

(panic)

'E was standin' right 'ere! Just a

second ago... Standin' right beside

me!...

MACGOWAN

Thanks for catchin' me.

INDIANA

I'd rather be catchin' trout.

INDIANA

Interesting blood type...

INDIANA

Cabernet sauvignon. 1897.

GALBRAITH

(pointing OFF SCREEN)

Look!

MACGOWAN

Galbraith... You come with me! We'll

search for Hennesey... Out here!

Bottomley... You go with Doctor

Jones...

(finger shaking, points

to inside of crypt)

In there.

INDIANA

Let's get outta' here.

BOTTOMLEY

Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open

the door!

INDIANA

(motioning to candle)

I need more light.

INDIANA

Bottomley?...

INDIANA

Bottomley?...

INDIANA

Who is it?... Who's there?...

MACGOWAN

Doctor Jones! Try to push!

INDIANA

Can't! There's some kinda' hot ice

coverin' the...

INDIANA

NOW they bite!

INDIANA

Excuse me, sir...? Hello...?

INDIANA

Canyou hear me?...

INDIANA

Listen, pal... There are two dead

Policemen upstairs and...

INDIANA

Chow time's over, mister. You better

start talkin'.

INDIANA

There's a lot of strange things

happening around here...

INDIANA

...and I want some answers! Do you

hear me?

(louder)

I want some answers! Now!

INDIANA

Haven't you had enough?

MACGOWAN

Now you can get back to your

fishing, Doctor Jones.

INDIANA

No chance, Mac. My plane leaves in

the morning. Vacation's over. Gotta'

get back to school.

MACGOWAN

(shakes his head)

'Tis a shame to go home empty

handed...

(smiles, an idea)

Tell ya' what, my friend... I fancy

me'self quite the fisherman...

Tomorrow, I'll go out and catch you

a real beauty, eh?...

INDIANA

(sarcastic smirk)

Right. Send it to me airmail.

MACGOWAN

(incredulous)

Doctor Jones! A MacGowan's word is

truer than...

INDIANA

Yeah, yeah...an angel's kiss. I

know.

BARON SEAGROVE

No...jail...can...hold...me.

VILLAGER

'E's done it! Indiana Jones has

captured the killer!

MACGOWAN

What is it, man? You look as if

you've seen a screamin' banshee!

INDIANA

Ah... It was nothing, Mac. Nothing

at all.

SLOW DISSOLVE:

TEDDY

Doctor Jones... I took your class

instead of all the others!... I

coulda' had Professor Needles...

Professor Eisenschmidt...

Professor...

ANGELA

You promised. You said you'd have

'em graded by yesterday.

VIRGIL

My paper finished yet? Name's

"Virgil Vektor". That's VIRGIL.

(spelling it out)

Capital V... I... R...

JULIA

My parents paid good money to send

me here. You know how much they

shelled out for your class?

CHARLES

He doesn't care about us. He only

wants fame and fortune. We're just a

buncha' peons to him.

VIRGIL

VEKTOR. Capital V... E... K...

BETSY

Hello, Ind --

(giggle)

Doctor Jones.

INDIANA

Not now, Betsy.

BETSY

LOOK at all of those papers!

INDIANA

Please, I...

BETSY

Want me to come by later? Help you

grade?

INDIANA

Help me grade. Yeah. Sure.

BETSY

Goodbye, Ind --

(giggles)

Doctor Jones!

VIRGIL

Didja' get the name? VIRGIL! Capital

V... I... R...

PRIESTLY

Moby Dick.

INDIANA

Huh?...

PRIESTLY

(points to photo)

That's what I named 'im. Captain

said it was the biggest fish he ever

saw.

PRIESTLY

What about you, Jonesey? You were

over in Scotty-land for two weeks...

Didja' catch the big one?...

INDIANA

Look, Priestly... I'm real busy...

REBECCA

Two-timing bastard!

REBECCA

How could you?!?... My own

Mother?!?... In my own bed?!?...

(slaps him again)

I've had it with you! It's over!

POSTMAN (O.S.)

Special Delivery! Dr. Indiana Jones!

DEAN COVENTRY

Doctor Jones, I've had complaints

from several of the students --

POSTMAN

Sign here.

DEAN COVENTRY

They feel that you are ignoring

them, that you are distracted...

INDIANA

(gives Postman the

signed paper)

Me?... Distracted?...

POSTMAN

(staring at Indy's

signature, puzzled)

What's this? "B+"? That's how you

sign your name?

DEAN COVENTRY

Marshall University is not the place

for sloppy behavior...

DEAN COVENTRY

I have one final warning for you,

Doctor Jones --

INDIANA

Yes... Oh, Hello, Marcus... Look,

can you hold on?...

(back to Dean)

You were saying, sir?

DEAN COVENTRY

Either you begin concentrating on

your --

INDIANA

(interrupted by phone)

Yes, Marcus... I'm still here...

Just hold on!

(back to Dean)

I'm very sorry, sir...

DEAN COVENTRY

(boiling)

-- concentrating on your teaching

duties or --

INDIANA

(into phone)

Damn it, Marcus! I'm standing here

with Dean... What?.. Just how

important?...

(listening, impatient)

It is, huh?... Okay. Five minutes.

Yeah. I'll be right over. But this

better be important, Marcus!

DEAN COVENTRY

You are on probation, Jones! Ten

days! If there is no improvement,

you will be dismissed!

INDIANA

I promise...by tomorrow...I'll have

all of these graded...and DRIED!

VIRGIL

VIRGIL VEKTOR! Capital V... I...

R...

INDIANA

(hands him paper)

"F"!

INDIANA

This better be important, Marcus...

or the museum will soon be

displaying my bones. My teaching

career is in danger of extinction.

MARCUS

(smiles)

You will not be disappointed,

Indiana.

CUT TO:

MARCUS (O.S.)

...Look familiar?

INDIANA

"Sun wu Kung, The Stone Monkey

King". Big deal. That was ten years

ago, Marcus.

(going back to papers,

wanting to change

subject)

Geez! This Heller kid's got the

worst grammar.

MARCUS

Ten years or fifty years. It will

always be in your blood.

INDIANA

(ignoring Marcus)

Don't believe this... He spells

"repeat" with two "E's".

MARCUS

Think back, Indiana. Remember your

desire? Your passion?

INDIANA

(still ignores Marcus)

Kid gets an "A" on content...a "D"

on form.

MARCUS

(angry, slams his fist

on the desk)

Damn it, man! You can't bury those

feelings forever!

INDIANA

Two years. Nearly two years of my

life...looking for the remains of

that Monkey...a piece of his

legendary Golden Hooped Rod...or

some sign of the Lost City.

(shakes his head)

Nine men perished on the journey.

Rest of us nearly died from

starvation or one of the many

horrible deseases we discovered...

(looks back to papers,

in a near whisper)

We still came back empty handed.

MARCUS

(threading the

projector)

One mustn't give up so easily,

Indiana.

INDIANA

Give up?!?... Marcus, we spent

thirteen months in China!...another

seven in India!...

MARCUS

But none in Africa.

INDIANA

(puzzled expression)

There was no proof...archeological

or anthropological...to indicate

that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited

Africa...

MARCUS

Until now.

INDIANA

Hey... My papers...

MARCUS

The woman is Dr. Clare Clarke. The

famous zoologist. She works in

Africa, studying animals in their

natural habitat.

INDIANA

Very interesting, Marcus. Now if

you'll turn the lights back on --

MARCUS

(continuing)

Three weeks ago, Dr. Clarke

discovered that cute little

fellow... "Tyki"...a pygmy of an

unusual race...unrelated to any

known African tribe...

INDIANA

(bored)

Marcus. The lights.

MARCUS

Dr. Clarke believes that Tyki comes

from the Lost Civilization of Sun

Wu-Kung.

INDIANA

What?... But how did Miss --

MARCUS

"Doctor".

INDIANA

"Doctor" Clake. How did she arrive

at such a preposterous hypothesis?

MARCUS

The pygmy speaks in a language that

has no African origins...but bears a

strong resemblance to Chinese.

INDIANA

Means nothing. The rivers of Africa

have been plagued by various

Oriental Pirates and Scavengers

since the 16th Century.

(turns from screen)

Not much evidence, Marcus.

MARCUS

There's more. The pygmy was found

wearing an ornamental peach stone

around his neck...believed to come

from Sun Wu-Kung's legendary Garden

Of Immortal Peaches.

INDIANA

(skeptical)

Marcus, there are countless

undiscovered African tribes...all

with various obscure beliefs and

practices...

(smirks)

One tribe may wear peach stones...

another may wear banana peels...

MARCUS

There is one final bit of

evidence...

INDIANA

Enlighten me.

MARCUS

The pygmy is over 200 years old.

INDIANA

That's impossible.

MARCUS

Dr. Clarke has done a considerable

amount of testing on the pygmy's

clothing...his sandals...everything

was over 200 years old.

INDIANA

(skeptical)

He's probably wearing his Great

Grandfather's stuff.

INDIANA

What does all of this have to do

with me?

MARCUS

Dr. Clarke wants to mount an

expedition to find the Lost City of

Sun Wu-Kung. She is quite familiar

with your reputation...she'd like

you to come along.

INDIANA

(gathering his papers)

No chance.

MARCUS

There will be money involved... The

museum is willing to fund the

expedition...

INDIANA

Sorry, Marcus. I've burned this

bridge.

MARCUS

Indiana...

INDIANA

Marcus. Please. I've got to finish

these...

MARCUS

You've got to finish something much

more important. You crossed the

threshold over a decade ago...and

it's been tearing at your insides

ever since.

(passionate)

My friend, if there is even one iota

of truth in Dr. Clarke's findings...

then you can lift the veil of

mystery that has surrounded this

Chinese legend for Centuries. You

may uncover the secrets to a Lost

Civilization...and possibly, to

man's never ending search for

immortality.

MARCUS

Indiana... Can you afford to pass up

the single most important adventure

of your life?

CUT TO:

BETSY

You can't do this to me!

INDIANA

(shaking tears off the

papers)

C'mon, Betsy. Relax. You're gettin'

'em all wet again.

BETSY

You just can't go away...I mean...

Africa is so far away, and...well...

(heartfelt)

I love you, Indy.

INDIANA

Thought we agreed this was s'posed

to be casual...

BETSY

You call what happened last night

"casual".

INDIANA

My dear...a momentary lapse into

passion does not a love affair make.

BETSY

(very upset)

Momentary lapse! So that's all I am

to you!

INDIANA

Betsy... Wait...

INDIANA

(angry)

Whatsa' matter with you!... Tryin'

to ruin my whip!...

BETSY

If I can't have you... I don't want

to live.

INDIANA

Drink this. You'll feel better.

INDIANA

C'mon, Betsy... Get a hold of

yourself. You're young. There are a

lot of other guys...

BETSY

Not like you.

INDIANA

(succumbing to his ego)

That's true...

(realizing his mistake)

But that's no reason to stop living!

Besides, I'm too old for you. By the

time you're seventy five, I'll be...

(calculates, the thought

of it makes him grimace)

Yeccchhh! I'll be disgusting.

BETSY

Don't leave me, Indy!

INDIANA

(cruel)

Look... You're just a flighty kid.

Twenty minutes after I walk out this

door, you'll have a date with the

college Romeo. Two hours from now,

you'll be madly in love with him. By

tomorrow, you'll forget I ever

existed.

BETSY

Never underestimate the

determination of a Brooklyn girl,

Doctor Jones. Never.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

SCRAGGY

Indy! At last we are reunited!

(looks to sky)

Oh, Keechingo, God Of Friendship...I

thank you for granting my wish!

INDIANA

I see you haven't changed, Scraggy.

SCRAGGY

Mahootmek, God Of Goodness, say...

"Before body make contact with

foreign object...one must cast out

bad spirits, or -- "

INDIANA

" -- or bad spirits will enter your

body!"

SCRAGGY

Yes! You have excellent memory,

Indy.

INDIANA

I should! Last time we saw each

other...you made me wear the same

clothes for 3 weeks straight.

SCRAGGY

Never separate body from clothes, or

bad spirits will hide in pockets!

INDIANA

In other words... If people never

changed clothes...there would be no

evil in the world.

SCRAGGY

Exactly!

INDIANA

(chuckles, puts his arm

around Scraggy)

I missed all a' your crazy

philosophies, Scraggy.

SCRAGGY

They not so crazy, Indy.

(serious, eyes wide with

fear)

These days... There is much evil in

the air. I feel it. Everywhere.

GUTTERBUHG

(German, English

subtitles)

Are we making contact?

SCRAGGY

Dr. Clarke! Why you kick Dr.

Jones?...

CLARE

Dr. Jones! Forgive me.

INDIANA

No sweat.

CLARE

Thought I was being attacked by a

degenerate sailor.

INDIANA

No. Just a degenerate archeologist.

CLARE

Your appearance is deceiving.

INDIANA

Likewise.

PORTER (O.S.)

Indiana Jones! Calling passenger

Indiana Jones!

PORTER

You left this aboard ship.

INDIANA

(puzzled)

There must be some mistake... I

didn't --

PORTER

That's you, ain't it?

INDIANA

Well, yeah...but...

SCRAGGY

Indy! Remember Mahootmek, God Of

Goodness! "Before body make contact

with foreign object -- "

SCRAGGY

"...you must cast out bad spirits!"

INDIANA

May I call you "Clare"?

CLARE

Please.

INDIANA

Well, Clare... We've obviously got a

lot of notes to compare... Let's get

started tonight...over dinner.

CLARE

I'd like that very much.

INDIANA

Friend of mine owns a Cafe... He'll

get us a nice quiet table. No

disturbances. Just the two of us --

SCRAGGY

I warn you, Indy! You must always

cast out bad spirits!

BETSY

My precious!

CLARE

(puzzled, to Indy)

Your daughter?

INDIANA

My assistant.

BETSY

His girlfriend.

CLARE

(revolted)

A child!

INDIANA

(to Clare)

It's nothing. Really.

(to Betsy)

What the hell are you doing here'?

BETSY

Proving my love for you.

CLARE

How terribly sordid.

INDIANA

(to Clare)

Puppy love. Schoolgirl crush. She'll

get over it.

BETSY

Never. This proves that nothing can

come between us. Not an ocean. Not

two separate Continents.

CLARE

Think I'm going to be ill.

INDIANA

(puzzled, to Betsy)

How...I mean... How could you stay

alive?

BETSY

Hey... I'm from Brooklyn.

INDIANA

But we'ye been sailing for three

weeks!

BETSY

Stowed away in the banana barrel.

Ate my way to the bottom.

CLARE

(nauseous)

Charming.

BETSY

(pointing to Clare)

Hey, Indy... Who's the babe?

CLARE

Your intellectual and emotional

superior.

BETSY

Yeah...well you're gettin' on my

nerves, Miss... Miss...

CLARE

(extends her hand)

"Doctor" Clare Clarke.

BETSY

(reluctantly shaking

Clare's hand)

Betsy Tuffet...

CLARE

As in curds and whey?

BETSY

(getting tough)

Listen, sister... You better stay

away from Indy...

CLARE

My dear, he has no interest in me.

I've already celebrated my tenth

Birthday.

INDIANA

Look, Betsy... Why don't you get

back on the boat... This time, as a

passenger.

SCRAGGY

Too late, Indy.

INDIANA

When's the next one out?

SCRAGGY

Two weeks.

MEPHISTO

(German, English

subtitles)

Were you successful?

MEPHISTO

(German, English

subtitles)

Keep a record of everything that is

said.

MEPHISTO

(German, English

subtitles)

Ever since our battle for the Lost

Ark... The feuhrer has been very

interested in the adventures of

Indiana Jones. Very interested.

CUT TO:

CLARE

Tyki... This is Doctor Jones...

INDIANA

He's a real gentleman.

CLARE

(shrugs)

Just basic manners. What it takes

most men a lifetime to learn...

Tyki's accomplished in two weeks.

(introduces Scraggy)

This is our guide, Scraggy Brier...

and Miss Bets--

CLARE

It appears that Bonzo is attracted

to Miss Tuffet's Derfume... Eau De

Banana Peel.

INDIANA

Where did you find him?...

CLARE

About ten miles from here. We were

on a photographic expedition...in

the thick of the jungle... I heard

sounds. Whimpering. Moaning. I took

a few steps, and found Tyki. He was

lying in a shallow swamp...semi

conscious...a high fever...nearly

dead from exhaustion. He had

obviously been travelling on foot

for many days, over countless

miles... So I brought him back to

the compound...nursed him back to

health...

INDIANA

Clare, I hate to quibble with your

anthropological abilities...

CLARE

Quibble.

INDIANA

...but if this little fellow is over

200 years old... I mean... What

accounts for his youthful

appearance?...his vitality?...

CLARE (O.S.)

Tyki was wearing this when I found

him.

CUT TO:

CLARE (O.S.)

Dr. Jones, you are obviously

familiar with the legend of Sun Wu-

King's Garden of Immortal Peaches?...

INDIANA (O.S.)

A bite from the fruit of that peach

tree would give a person eternal

life...make them forever young...

CUT BACK TO:

INDIANA

There's nothing unusual about this

...nothing to indicate that it's

from Sun Wu Kung's garden...

CLARE

This fruit fly had a normal life-

span of TWENTY FOUR HOURS.

(frustrated sigh)

As an experiment...the fly was put

in this room...alone...with only the

peach stone to sustain its

existence. The fly stayed alive for

THREE WEEKS.

(looks at dead fly)

Until now.

INDIANA

Sorry.

CLARE

He understands him?

INDIANA

(nods)

Scraggy knows hundreds of

languages... He's the best guide in

Africa.

(turns to Scraggy)

Ask Tyki where he came from.

SCRAGGY

He say... "I come from 'Land Of City

On Clouds'".

INDIANA

(puzzled)

Huh?... What the hell's that s'posed

to mean?

(to Scraggy)

Can he take us there?

SCRAGGY

He say if he could... He would go

back!

SCRAGGY

He say "Pai Cho" may help you.

CLARE

"Pai Cho"?

INDIANA

The Sacres Proverbs and Writings of

Sun Wu Kung.

(anxious, looking at

Scraggy)

His disciples always carry the Pai

Cho with them...

INDIANA

Can you translate it?...

BETSY

Get...him...off...of...me...!

CUT TO:

SCRAGGY

"Sun Wu Kung run like fire,

He journey to Many Monkey Land,

To build his final empire."

BETSY

Who's Sun Wu-Kung?

INDIANA

(ignoring Betsy, to

Scraggy)

Many Monkey Land... That's a

definite reference to Africa.

BETSY

Africa?... He journeyed to

Africa?...

CLARE

(also ignores Betsy, to

Indiana)

That confirms our suspicions that he

may have formed his Civilization

here...

BETSY

What civilization?

INDIANA

(angry, to Betsy)

Betsy. Keep your trap shut. This

doesn't concern you.

BETSY

(insulted)

Fine. Terrific. Who cares about this

stuff anyway! We're in a nightclub.

We should be havin' fun.

(grabs Indiana's hand)

C'mon, Indy. Let's dance.

INDIANA

Later.

BETSY

What a buncha' stiffs!

(condescending, to

Clare)

Bet you can't dance.

CLARE

Quite the contrary...I spent several

months studying dance.

BETSY

Oh yeah? Whattayou' know?... The

Bunny Hop?... The Jitterbug?...

CLARE

(shakes her head)

The Bondogea. The Kyebe Kyebe. The

Dungumaro.

BETSY

Huh?

CLARE

African Tribal dances.

BETSY

Never heard of 'em.

CLARE

Of course not. They're beyond the

spectrum of your microscopic world.

DASHIELL

Enjoying your dinners?...

DASHIELL

Watch yourself, sport. Most of the

talk here tonight is about you. And

it isn't good.

DASHIELL

I don't know what you've done to the

Nazis. But they are certainly no

friends of yours.

CUT TO:

GUARD

Who's there?...

CUT TO:

SCRAGGY

"With his Golden Hooped Rod,

And its powerful lightning rays,

Sun Wu Kung build Water Curtain Cave,

Where he live for 500 days."

CLARE

The Golden Hooped Rod?

INDIANA

A heavenly staff with many different

powers...most notably, it had the

ability to transform itself into

hundreds of objects...

(staring)

It remains the most priceless

treasure of Sun Wu Kung's empire.

CLARE

And what is the...the Water Curtain

Cave?

INDIANA

Sun Wu Kung's legendary hideout...an

enormous secret cave, hidden behind

a running waterfall.

INDIANA

This proves that the Water Curtain

Cave exists in Africa...

(to Scraggy)

Does it mention anything about Sun

Wu Kung's travels?

SCRAGGY

(reading scroll)

Only place called..."Twisted Snake

Water".

INDIANA

The Zarnbesi River! It has a

reputation for its deadly water

snakes...

CLARE

It would have been Sun Wu Kung's

logical path.

INDIANA

(confident, anxious)

It will also be our logical path.

CLARE

Please try to control that monstrous

libido of yours!

INDIANA

We have to get back to the compound.

Tyki may be in danger.

CUT T0:

CUT TO:

INDIANA

Get your hands off him.

INDIANA

When I tell you... Hit the brakes!

INDIANA

Now, Scraggy!

BETSY

About time we had some fun!

SCRAGGY

Bad spirits have Indy! He in

trouble! Big trouble!

GUTTERBUHG

Goodnight, Doctor Jones.

DASHIELL

Scraggy said you might be needing

some help, sport.

DASHIELL

Indy! Rollout!

DASHIELL

You okay, sport?

INDIANA

Dash!...

BETSY

What a romantic night!

CLARE

Will they hurt Tyki?

INDIANA

(shaking his head)

They know he's important to us.

(holds up ancient

scroll)

They'll use him to bargain for this.

BETSY

Indy, you smell so good! So

masculine!

CLARE

Will they be following us?

INDIANA

Every step of the way.

BETSY

Mmmm, Indy. I love it when you don't

shave. It's so sexy!

SCRAGGY

Pandoola, God of Purity, say...

"Always stay ten paces ahead of bad

spirit".

INDIANA

Exactly. We can't let the Nazis get

to the City first. If they do,

they'll wipe out one of the greatest

archeological finds in History!

BETSY

How 'bout a little goodnight kiss?

BETSY

Mmmmm, Indy...you really know the

way to a girl's heart!

CLARE

What is that awful aroma?

INDIANA

Scraggy's takin' a shower.

INDIANA

He believes that onions keep bad

spirits from entering his body.

CLARE

(writing in her

notebook)

In all my years of anthropology...

I've never run across anyone or

anything quite like Scraggy.

INDIANA

(chuckles)

He's a rare breed.

(turns, looks at Clare

for the first time)

You're looking very lovely.

CLARE

You're looking very lecherous.

INDIANA

(turns away, angry)

Just tryin' to be friendly.

CLARE

Save it for the schoolgirls.

INDIANA

Look, Clare... Betsy's just an

anxious archeology student...she

admires my work...

(egotistical shrug)

Who can blame her?...

(back to his point)

But it's just some kinda' hero

worship thing...

BETSY

(pops in from OFF

SCREEN, kisses Indiana)

I dreamed about our first night

together!

INDIANA

You're writin' this down?...

CLARE

(nods)

I'm keeping an accurate record of

our journey.

INDIANA

What's that got to do with my

personal life?

CLARE

Evidence. I plan on testifying at

your child molestation trial.

INDIANA

Why do I do this to myself?

BETSY

(holds her head in pain,

to Clare)

Hey, lady...you're s'posed to be a

Doctor...you got any cures for a

hangover?...

CLARE

The best I've heard was used by a

New Zealand Tribe...

(pauses, thinking)

One part crushed owl skull...two

parts rhino saliva...one part zebra

dandruff.

INDIANA

No, No... Get a cup of donkey sweat

...two spoons of skunk hair...and

one pint of shredded lizard tongue.

SCRAGGY

I always use family cure! Two spoons

chopped leeches... Half cup horse

mucous...two quarts crocodile urine!

BETSY

(ready to throw up)

Ex...cuse...me...!

SCRAGGY

How far we travel, Indy?...

INDIANA

Almost 20 miles.

CLARE

Any sign of the Nazis?

INDIANA

(shakes his head,

confident)

Long as we keep up this pace...

they'll have trouble tracking us.

CUT TO:

MEPHISTO

(German, English

subtitles)

We must leave. Immediately.

DISSOLVE TO:

BETSY

Don't you know somethin' else?

Somethin' upbeat?...

BETSY

It's so hot... Stuffy... Do we have

to stay on this stupid boat all

night?...

INDIANA

(nods)

We have to keep moving.

BETSY

Can we at least jump in the

water?... Go for a swim?...

CLARE

There's an old legend about the

Zambesi... In ancient times,

criminals were given their choice of

execution...or swimming across the

Zambesi. Most chose execution.

INDIANA

Clare's right. We'll be safer on the

boat.

(annoyed, to Betsy)

Now quit moanin' and eat your food.

BETSY

You are so rude! I travel thousands

of miles just to be with you...and

everybody treats me like dirt!

(to Clare)

Nobody even talks to me without

making some condescending remark

they think I'm too stupid to

understand!

(very upset)

So maybe I don't know a lot about

weird tribal dances... I'm still

pretty good with anthropology and

archeology... Maybe I could even

help you out...if somebody gave me a

chance...clued me in to what it is

we're doin' here...

(to Indy)

'Cause whether you like it or not,

Indiana Jones... I'm part of this

expedition, too!

SCRAGGY

(motions to crew

members)

My friends also curious about where

we journey to, Indy.

CLARE

Tell us all a bedtime story, Doctor

Jones.

INDIANA

Long ago...a place known as the

Flower Fruit Mountain, in the

Chinese province of Ao-Lai...was

struck by lightning. A Stone Monkey,

"Sun Wu-Kung", was born.

SCRAGGY

This monkey?... He could walk?...

Talk?... Like human?...

INDIANA

More than human. He was blessed with

countless heavenly powers... But it

wasn't enough. Sun Wu-Kung wanted to

learn the secret of Eternal Life...

of Immortality...

(pause)

Equipped with his Golden Hooped Rod

to protect him, Sun Wu Kung

travelled the world for many years

...learning the secret philosophies

and teachings of Eternal Youth.

Eventually, he was granted entrance

to heaven...where the Jade Emperor

gave Sun Wu Kung the title of "Great

Sage of the Heavens"...and permitted

him to oversee the Garden of

Immortal Peaches.

(pause)

After several years, the stone

monkey returned to somewhere on

earth. Here, he ruled an empire...a

Civilization of Monkeys and humans

who had life spans of many hundred

years...

(shrugs)

The exact whereabouts of that Lost

City has been a mystery for hundreds

of years...until Doctor Clarke

discovered the pygmy.

INDIANA

It's uncertain just how much of this

legend is based in reality...

Nevertheless, we're hoping to find

some sign of the Lost Civilization.

BETSY

What about Sun Wu Kung?...

INDIANA

Whatever he was...a stone idol...an

actual monkey...a human being...is

unknown. But he is one of the most

influentual religious figures in

History, and his remains are most

likely somewhere in the Lost City.

INDIANA

Sound familiar?

SCRAGGY

(shakes his head)

It is far, far away...many miles...

BETSY

(frightened)

What is it?... Some kinda' weird

animal?...

CLARE

No animal sounds like that.

SCRAGGY

Could be "Banseebaba".

CLARE

Banseebaba?

SCRAGGY

Banseebaba is giant demon from hell.

He is 50 feet tall. Breathes fire.

Make sound like human never hear

before. He is made up of all evil in

the world!

CLARE

Cheery thought.

INDIANA

Whatever the hell it is... It went

to sleep for the night. Which is

what we should do.

CUT TO:

BETSY

Couldn't sleep. The heat. I'm in the

mood for passion.

INDIANA

I'm in the mood for isolation.

BETSY

I'm not leaving. Not till I get a

kiss.

INDIANA

Betsy...

BETSY

(serious)

One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear.

I'll wake the whole boat.

INDIANA

OKay. Just one.

(leans toward her,

pauses)

Keep your mouth closed.

INDIANA

What's that you're writing?...

CLARE

"The Erotic Adventures Of Indiana

Jones, Professor Of Perversity".

INDIANA

(back to shaving)

Very funny.

INDIANA

You are blowing this Betsy thing all

out of proportion...

INDIANA

It's not as if I have this sleazy

reputation...

INDIANA

I am a respected...honored...

admired...

BETSY

C'mon... You ain't so tough. You

wouldn't last ten minutes in

Brooklyn.

INDIANA

You son of a bitch.

INDIANA

(still fighting)

Scraggy!... No!... Keep goin'

straight!... Full steam ahead!...

SCRAGGY

What?... You crazy Indy?... We be

crushed!... We smash into rock

wall!...

INDIANA

No!... Trust me!... Full steam

ahead!... Full steam ahead !...

INDIANA

Wait...

INDIANA

Free the girl...

(glances to his captive

friends)

...and my friends...

(lights a match, moves

it toward TNT fuses)

...or I blow your hideout here out

of the water!

KEZURE

Good. We will all die.

INDIANA

We can take you to the Lost City of

Sun Wu Kung!

KEZURE

Hah! Better men than you have tried

to find the Lost City... They have

all failed.

(cynical laugh)

You are a fool.

INDIANA

(as the TNT fuse burns

LOWER...LOWER...)

No... You're the fool. You and your

friends are hiding out in Sun Wu

Kung's Water Curtain Cave...and you

don't even know it.

KEZURE

(puzzled, looking

around)

Huh?...

INDIANA

The Sacred Pai-Cho Scroll.

INDIANA

Don't bother. Only WE can translate

it.

KEZURE

The Lost City... Said to have

streets paved in gold...treasures

far greater than any mortal man

could imagine...

KEZURE

Your pathetic lives will be spared.

For now.

(scratching his neck)

But everything we find in the Lost

City...belongs to ME.

INDIANA

Fat chance, Sinbad. It's 50-50. Or

you've got no deal.

KEZURE

(vicious smile)

It is my way. Or you've got no head.

CUT TO:

INDIANA

Read that last proverb again...

SCRAGGY

(reads translation)

"High tide drowns curiosity,

Low tide quenches thirst".

INDIANA

(stands, looking at the

surroundings)

There's something here...something

that could help us...

BETSY

Look at 'em. It's like they've never

seen a woman before.

CLARE

To them... We're the ultimate women.

BETSY

Kinda' flattering, isn't it?...

Being the girl of 200 guy's dreams?

INDIANA

Is there an area... A place where

the tide changes?...

KEZURE

In a few hours...the water will be

lower...much lower...

INDIANA

And the remainder of this wall will

be visible?....

INDIANA

We're gonna need light. A lot of

light. On this wall.

DISSOLVE TO:

KEZURE

To my good fortune.

KEZURE

You know... We are very much alike,

Doctor jones.

INDIANA

I doubt that.

KEZURE

We both share a remarkable talent

for killing.

INDIANA

I've never gotten used to killing,

pal. I do it for survival.

KEZURE

I do it for pleasure.

INDIANA

(astounded)

This is incredible...this map was

obviously used by Sun Wu Kung's

disciples...if they were ever

lost...

KEZURE

These drawings...they are of the

surrounding jungle...

INDIANA

(points to "X")

Where is that?...

KEZURE

It is located at the most South

Eastern part of the jungle...near

the mountains... There is a village

there. The Mongooboo Tribe.

INDIANA

You know them?

KEZURE

Very well. I traded with the chief

for many years.

INDIANA

(anxious, excited)

Good. We'll leave in the morning.

INDIANA

That sound. Again.

SCRAGGY

(listening)

Still far away...but getting closer.

KEZURE

The village is there. Beyond the

thick of jungle.

INDIANA

Thought you said they knew you?...

INDIANA

Wait... Listen... They're not

following us...

INDIANA

Be careful where you step... We've

got to move slowly...very slowly...

INDIANA

Clare! What are you...?!?

CLARE

I imitated the sound of a Lion

Mother calling her babies.

INDIANA

C'mon. Let's get outta' --

INDIANA

Is this the Tribal Chief you told me

about?... Your friend?...

KEZURE

(points to shrunken

head)

No. That is him.

KEZURE

This is a different tribe. New. They

have taken over the village.

INDIANA

What happened to the other tribe?

INDIANA

You recognize their language?

SCRAGGY

I tell him we divine messengers of

Sun Wu-Kung. If he interfere with

our mission... Jade Emperor come

down from heavens and destroy his

village.

SCRAGGY

I tell him we lose path to city... I

ask if he have something to help us.

SCRAGGY

(translating)

He say this will help us. And since

we are divine messengers...we will

know how to use it!

CUT TO:

BETSY

Indy. I'm frightened.

INDIANA

I'm claustrophobic.

INDIANA

Clare!... Wait!...

BETSY

An earthquake?

SCRAGGY

Wildebeest.

CUT TO:

CLARE

We have to get out... Or we'll be

crushed to death.

INDIANA

Scraggy... How close?

SCRAGGY

Two miles.

INDIANA

Where's the softest ground?...

CUT TO:

SCRAGGY

Oh, no! Many dead spirits! Bad

spirits... We must stay away...

CUT TO:

CLARE

That's odd... Wildebeests will not

stampede unless provoked...

SCRAGGY

This time, it is very close, Indy.

Very close!

SCRAGGY

Indy?... Indy?...

GUTTERBUHG

(German; English

subtitles)

Fire!

SCRAGGY

Safest place from bad spirits...is

in branches of tree.

GUTTERBUHG

(German; English

subtitles)

Send help! We need assistance!

SCRAGGY

Indy in trouble! We must help!

CREW MEMBER

(German accent)

Don't move.

(to the others)

All of you. Stay where you are.

CLARE

It was you. You're the reason the

Nazis found us.

BETSY

Nobody move. Or we'll go over.

INDIANA

Jump!... Jump!...

INDIANA

Call your mommy.

INDIANA

This is Jones. I've got your tank.

(pause)

It's all over, pal. You lose.

CUT TO:

MEPHISTO

Doctor Jones... You surprise me. For

a supposedly intelligent man...you

jump to childish conclusions.

Remember... You are driving our

tank. We can FOLLOW you anywhere.

(vehement)

You are far from defeating us, my

friend. The battle has only just

begun.

INDIANA

We've got to move. Fast.

(points to Tyki)

Ask him if he knows the way to the

City from here.

SCRAGGY

He do not know exact place... But it

is somewhere over there.

INDIANA

A lotta' good that does us... It

could take us months...years...to

search everyone of those.

BETSY

Maybe he knows what to do with

this...

SCRAGGY

It is "Magical Mirror of Sun Wu

Kung"...

INDIANA

But whattayou do with it?

CLARE

"I come from Land Of City On

Clouds".

CUT TO:

KEZURE

This is called "Taskipi". Only the

bravest play.

BETSY

I've been talking to Dr. Clarke

about our problem.

INDIANA

(struggling with tank)

Problem?... Hey... What're you two

doin' talkin' behind my back?...

CLARE

Betsy needed help. I obliged.

INDIANA

Since when did you become the female

Sigmund Freud?

CLARE

Since I received a Masters Degree in

Psychology.

SCRAGGY

We play again?

KEZURE

(pause, serious)

The game is not yet over, my friend.

SCRAGGY

Oh?

KEZURE

You have lost. You must pay.

SCRAGGY

(going through pockets)

I don't have money...

KEZURE

No. No. money.

(deadly smile)

Rules of the game declare that I may

choose a souvenir.

(removes a knife)

A part of your body. Any part I

wish.

BETSY

Dr. Clarke says that you're not

really in love with me. You're just

trying to prove that you can still

attract younger women. You're

terrified of getting old.

INDIANA

That's crazy.

BETSY

That's what I told her. I told her

that you really did love me.

INDIANA

(fumbling)

Well...that's...ah...well...

BETSY

(worried)

You mean... She was right?...

INDIANA

No... I mean Yes... I mean...

INDIANA

No, Betsy. I don't love you.

BETSY

(tears fill her eyes)

That's the first time you ever said

it!

CLARE

There. There. He's a very disturbed

man.

KEZURE

Your eyes. They are a striking deep

blue.

INDIANA

(angry)

Enough. We're in this together. If

we start fighting among ourselves...

we'll never get out alive.

KEZURE

You owe me, old man.

CLARE

Doctor Jones!!!

CUT TO:

SCRAGGY

He say that two miles ahead...we

will find his home.

INDIANA

How do I work the big gun?

INDIANA

Want your souvenir?

(grabs Gutterbuhg's left

arm)

Start with his good arm.

GUTTERBUHG

W-W-Wait!... Please!...

GUTTERBUHG

There. That is what you want.

INDIANA

(pointing to Gorilla)

Tell him to take off my stuff!

SCRAGGY

He say... "Our Prince has returned

home".

SCRAGGY

He thank us...for returning his son.

BETSY

If the little guy's pushin' 200

years?... How old's his Father?

SCRAGGY

His name "Bohbala". He is Ruler of

City, faithful servant of his Lord

and Master... Sun Wu-Kung.

(pause, smile)

He welcome us to stay. As long as we

wish.

INDIANA

(anxious, to Scraggy)

Ask him where we may find the burial

place...or the remains...of Sun Wu-

Kung...

INDIANA

Bastard...

SCRAGGY

It is written... If ruler is

defeated by greater power...he who

possess that power...

(points to Gutterbuhg)

...shall become ruler!

INDIANA

This is turning into one helluva

nightmare.

GUTTERBUBG

(hears, smiles at Indy)

One you will never awaken from,

Doctor Jones.

CUT TO:

GUTTERBUHG

I want to see Jones!

GUTTERBUHG

Your friend makes a wonderful

interpreter.

GUTTERBUHG

"The Nazi Party will exist for one

thousand years...and I wish to be

alive for every year!"

(pause)

That is a favorite philosophy of our

feuher.

INDIANA

Your feuher's philosphies belong on

a bathroom wall.

GUTTERBUHG

(angry, slapping Indy

across the face)

This is a very serious matter,

Doctor Jones. It could save your

life.

(pause)

I understand that somewhere in this

City...there is a Garden of...

Immortal Peaches?...

(Indy doesn't respond,

Gutterbuhg continues)

I want information about this

Garden... And I would greatly

appreciate it, if you would share

everything you know, with me.

INDIANA

I don't share anything with Nazis.

GUTTERBUHG

Very well. My friends will be here

soon. They will rest...enjoy the

pleasures of my newfound kingdom...

(kisses a woman, and

pushes her away)

Then we shall exterminate these

worthless people! Destroy their

City! And we will carry away all of

its riches...in pieces.

CUT TO:

DRIVER

(German, English

subtitles)

Sir... We shall reach the mountain

top in less than sixty minutes.

CUT TO:

GUTTERBUHG

Doctor Jones... Those beasts are

anxious to run wild. Free.

(vicious smile)

How long will you be able to ride...

before they TEAR YOU IN TWO?

GUTTERBUHG

Goodbye, Doctor Jones.

INDIANA

Heil Hitler!

GUTTERBUHG

Heil Hitler!

INDIANA

Nazis'll be be here soon. We gotta

move fast.

CUT TO:

MEPHISTO

(German; English

subtitles)

Idiot!... Why are you dressed like

that!... Where is your uniform?...

SCRAGGY

They want you to give speech.

INDIANA

What?!?...

SCRAGGY

Before battle... General always give

speech to inspire troops.

INDIANA

General?... Who the hell do they

think I am... Custer?...

INDIANA

Geez... The only speeches I remember

are from college...when I played

ball...

INDIANA

Men...and, ah...women... I...ah...

We're about to face one of our

toughest opponents... They've got

size...hardware...and well, quite

frankly...we're the underdogs...

INDIANA

But...well, if it wasn't for the

little guy...where would this

country be?...

(excited, louder)

I mean...I knew this little guy once

...a scrawny runt, with thick black

glasses and about 300 different

kinds of allergies... But this

little kid had a dream... He wanted

to be on the football team.

(Music rises, so does

Indy's voice)

Well, all the big guys made his life

miserable...always shoving his head

in the drinking fountain...putting

mustard in his pants...throwing me

...'er, HIM!...throwing HIM in the

shower with all his clothes on...

(louder, heartfelt)

But that little guy didn't quit. Be

worked hard. Never gave up. And in

two years...he was the Quarterback.

Star of the team. And you know why?...

(Music SOARS, as does

Indy's voice)

'Cause that little kid had somethin'

that those big guys never heard

of... He had HEART! And nothin' can

stop that! Nothin'!

(we hear the Nazis

approaching, Indy

screams)

Now let's go out there and show 'em

JUST HOW TOUGH THE LITTLE GUYS ARE!

attackers.

But... It's... It's the middle of

the night...

SCRAGGY

Sun always shine in the Garden of

Immortal Peaches.

KEZURE

These are the peaches that make one

...forever young?...

CLARE

What does it say?...

SCRAGGY

(translating)

"Our Lord... Our Master... Sun...

Wu... Kung"

CLARE

Damn you, Jones! Why couldn't you be

here to share this with me!

SUN WU KUNG

We cannot bury these men!... This is

a garden of life... Not of death!...

BETSY

Why's he speakin' in English?

CLARE

He is a heavenly being. According to

legend, when a heavenly being

speaks, men of all countries can

understand him. We hear him in

English...the pygmies hear him in

their language.

SUN WU KUNG

Return their souls!... I demand

it!... Return their souls!

INDIANA

What the hell's goin' on?

CLARE

I think there is someone you should

meet...

INDIANA

You... You're... Sun Wu Kung?...

SUN WU KUNG

You are... Indiana Jones?...

INDIANA

(taken aback)

Huh?... You know me?

SUN WU KUNG

(nods)

I have watched you for many, many

years...from the heavens. I was

fascinated by your bravery...your

passion...in searching for me.

INDIANA

Well, I... Thanks I'm very honored.

SUN WU KUNG

The honor is mine, Doctor Jones. You

and your friends have saved my city

from ruin.

(a pause)

I would like to return the favor.

SUN WU KUNG

The Golden Hooped Rod will be a

faithful friend. It is capable of

one hundred transformations...and

will always remain by your side.

SUN WU KUNG

I will explore the heavens for

another. Surely, my search will be

shorter and less hazardous than

yours!

SUN WU KUNG

With my city alive again...I will be

able to return to the heavens.

(warm smile to Indy and

the others)

Goodbye...my dear friends.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE T0:

KEZURE

She is a wonderful treasure...

Eh?...

INDIANA

We had a deal.

KEZURE

(moves sword closer to

Indy's throat)

I have no deals with dead men.

INDIANA

Son of a bitch.

KEZURE

(shrugs, laughs)

I am an old Pirate, Doctor Jones. Do

you suddenly expect me to treat you

with kindness and fairness?... It is

not my way of life!

KEZURE

Kill them...

(takes another bite of

the peach)

But save their hair. I will make a

coat out of it.

BETSY

I thought the peaches promised

immortality...eternal youth?...

INDIANA

The garden of immortal peaches

promises life only to those who are

pure in heart.

(pause)

Kezure was evil. His heart was

filled with greed.

CUT TO:

INDIANA

Where's Betsy?... The boat leaves in

five minutes...

SCRAGGY

Oh, Indy! Indy! I want to give you

something for your journey!

SCRAGGY

Take one drink before bed. It keep

INDIANA

Thanks, Scraggy...

BETSY (O.S.)

Indy!...

INDIANA

Where're your bags?

BETSY

I'm not leaving.

INDIANA

Huh?... But, you... You have to

finish school.

BETSY

I'm staying on as Clare's assistant.

INDIANA

But you're MY assistant.

BETSY

Not any more. I'm having my credits

transfered.

INDIANA

Why?...

BETSY

Clare is a brilliant teacher.

INDIANA

(jealous)

So am I.

CLARE

Yes, but I don't offer a course in

seduction.

INDIANA

You stay out of this.

BETSY

Indy... I thought you wanted me out

of your life...

INDIANA

That was before I realized how

gifted...how talented you are... I

mean... I could really use you...

CLARE

Especially aboard ship for three

weeks. It gets terribly lonely.

INDIANA

I warned you...

BETSY

Indy, I've learned a lot from you.

But it's time I started

concentrating on a career in

anthropology...instead of romance.

INDIANA

(sighs, to Betsy)

You've certainly developed a mature

attitude.

BETSY

(hugs him)

Thanks to you.

(pauses, looking into

Indy's eyes)

You know... I always thought of you

as my knight in shining armor...

INDIANA

(flattered)

Really?

BETSY

But now, I'll think of you as the

Father I never had.

INDIANA

(rolls his eyes)

Terrific.

CLARE

Doctor Jones...although your libido

is questionable, your bravery and

intelligence are exceptional.

(a smile)

It has been an honor working with

you.

INDIANA

(taken aback)

Why... Thanks.

INDIANA

You know, Clare...there's

something...

CLARE

Yes...

INDIANA
