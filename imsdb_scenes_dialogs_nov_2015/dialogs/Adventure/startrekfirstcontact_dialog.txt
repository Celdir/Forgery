DATA

The Borg ship has modified its

shields, Captain. Our phasers

will no longer be effective.

PICARD

Ready quantum torpedo.

WORF

Aye, sir. Only three left.

GEORDI'S COM VOICE

La Forge to bridge.

PICARD

Go ahead.

17   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING                                       17

GEORDI

Captain, I'm starting to worry

about the hull integrity. We've

been running the support field at

full power for three hours

straight. I don't know how much

longer it's going to hold up.

PICARD

Understood. Keep me informed.

18   INT. BRIDGE                                                 18

TROI

Incoming transmission from the

Borg.

PICARD

On screen.

BORG

Your defense perimeter is

useless. You will be assimilated.

PICARD

(to Borg)

Break off your attack. By now,

you must realize you can't win...

BORG

Your opinion is irrelevant. We

are the Borg. Resistance is

futile.

PICARD

We'll see about that...

(to Worf)

Fire.

DATA

Main power still on-line, Captain.

RIKER

Casualties are light, Captain.

Minor buckling on the port

nacelle. Nothing serious.

WORF

Incoming message from the Starship

Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.

PICARD

On screen.

ADMIRAL HAYES

The new quantum torpedoes are

doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've

destroyed forty-seven Borg ships

so far... and only lost fifteen of

our own.

(beat)

But one of the Borg ships has

broken through our defenses, and

it's heading directly for Earth.

Can you handle it?

PICARD

Absolutely.

ADMIRAL HAYES

Good hunting. Hayes out.

PICARD

Mister Data, set a pursuit course.

Maximum warp.

DATA

We are approaching the Terran

System, Captain.

PICARD

Go to impulse. Where's the Borg

ship?

DATA

It has entered Earth orbit.

(off console)

Correction -- it is not in orbit.

It is heading directly toward the

surface.

PICARD

What?

RIKER

(incredulous)

Some sort of suicide tactic?

DATA

Unknown, sir. Suicide tactics are

not normally associated with the

Borg.

DATA

Sensors show a temporal signature

emanating from the Sphere. High

concentrations of tachyons...

PICARD

And chronometric particles... it's

as though they're trying to create

a temporal vortex...

PICARD

Time travel... they're attempting

time travel...

(beat)

Full power, Mister Data. Worf,

quantum torpedoes at my command!

WORF

Aye, sir.

RIKER

Main power off-line!

DATA

Switching to emergency back-ups.

RIKER

We're caught in some kind of

energy wake from the vortex...

PICARD

Worf... torpedo... now!

DATA

I have helm control.

PICARD

Where's the Sphere?

WORF

They have traveled into the

vortex... through time.

DATA

The vortex is collapsing, sir.

PICARD

Contact Starfleet Command.

WORF

No response.

(reacts to console)

I'm not reading any Starfleet com

traffic in this entire sector.

TROI

(off console)

Captain, I've scanned the planet.

The atmosphere contains a high

concentration of methane, carbon

monoxide and fluorine. The oceans

have been chemically altered, as

well.

PICARD

On screen.

PICARD

Life signs?

TROI

Population... thirty-five

billion...

(reacts)

All Borg.

DATA

(off console)

The planet's surface is covered

with Borg technology.

(beat)

So is the moon... and three other

planets in this solar system.

TROI

But how?

PICARD

They must've done it in the

past... they went back and

changed history...

RIKER

(stunned)

They did it... they assimilated

Earth.

WORF

But if they changed history...

then why are we still here?

DATA

We were caught in the temporal

wake from the vortex. It must

have protected us from any changes

in the time-line.

WORF

Captain, there are five Borg ships

closing in on our position.

PICARD

(making a decision)

Data, set a course for that

vortex.

TROI

Captain...?

PICARD

We have to follow them back...

repair whatever damage they've

done to that time-line.

DATA

(working)

Course laid in. Engaging impulse

engines.

percent...

PICARD

Steady as she goes.

PICARD

What year is it?

DATA

(working)

According to our astrometric

readings... the year is 2063.

WORF

Captain, I've found the Borg

Sphere. It's on the far side of

the planet...firing at the

surface.

PICARD

(to Data)

Intercept course, full impulse.

(to Worf)

Weapons status?

WORF

Phasers are off-line... we have

two quantum torpedoes left. But

the computer targeting system has

been destroyed.

PICARD

Go to manual.

PICARD

(over above action, to

Troi)

Track their weapons fire.

TROI

(off console)

Western hemisphere... North

American continent...

DATA

We are within torpedo range.

RIKER

They've seen us. They're taking

evasive action.

PICARD

(urgent)

Mister Worf?

WORF

Target...

TROI

Captain, they're firing at a

nuclear missile silo... in central

Montana.

WORF

(struggling)

Target...

PICARD

(worried)

Montana...

WORF

Target locked!

PICARD

Fire!

PICARD

(to Data)

Mister Data, I want to know the

exact date and time.

(to Riker)

Give me a damage report on that

missile silo.

DATA

(works)

Today is March second, 2063. The

time in Montana is oh-eight-forty-

five.

RIKER

(works)

Looks like they damaged the

silo...

PICARD

Life signs?

RIKER

Can't tell. Long-range bio-

sensors are off-line.

PICARD

Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister

La Forge and a security team meet

me in Transporter Room Three.

Civilian clothes.

WORF

Aye, sir.

RIKER

Captain?

PICARD

In twenty-four hours, Zephram

Cochrane is supposed to conduct

the very first warp test... from

a missile silo in Montana. If I'm

right, the Borg were trying to

change the course of human history

by killing him or destroying his

ship.

RIKER

(nods in understanding)

And if they succeed, humans won't

make First Contact with the

Vulcans tomorrow.

(beat)

As First Officer I should be the

one beaming down...

PICARD

Normally, I would agree. But in

this case, the mission requires a

certain knowledge of 21st century

history. You're many things,

Number One, but you're not much of

an historian.

RIKER

Good luck, sir.

PICARD

I'll keep in contact. You have

the Bridge.

Will somebody please tell me where

we're going?

PICARD

Montana.

(to Chief)

Energize.

BEVERLY

Montana? Well, that answers

everything. Why the hell are we --

CUT TO:

45   EXT. MONTANA PLAINS - CONTINUOUS - DAY                      45

BEVERLY

(continuing)

-- going to Montana?

GEORDI

(off tricorder)

I have the silo, sir. Bearing

three one zero... distance, three

hundred meters.

PICARD

Let's go.

BEVERLY

Go where? Hello? Is anyone going

to tell me what we're doing here?

PICARD

We're here to find Zephram

Cochrane. He may be injured or

dead.

BEVERLY

Cochrane... the inventor of warp

drive?

PICARD

Yes...

BEVERLY

But he's been dead for three

hundred...

(realizes, long sigh)

Oh God... we've gone back in time

again, haven't we?

PICARD

I'm afraid so. If the Borg

succeed in preventing First

Contact with the Vulcans... Earth

will remain in the Second Dark

Age... an easy target when the

Borg arrive in the 24th century.

BEVERLY

Well, why didn't you just say so

in the first place?

TROI

Lieutenant Sandra Farrel.

TROI

It appears death was caused by a

plasma discharge.

(beat)

I'll note in her record that she

never left her post.

TROI

Did you know her?

DATA

Not very well. We met shortly

after the Enterprise-E was

commissioned. I found her to be

a most... promising officer.

TROI

Data... are you sure you're all

right?

DATA

I am still having difficulty

integrating certain emotions into

my programming. Grief, loss,

remorse...

TROI

We still have to make reports on

ten more crewmen killed in action.

Maybe you should deactivate your

emotion chip until we're done.

DATA

No. Human beings do not have that

luxury, and neither should I.

TROI

I will admit... there are times

when I wish I had an emotion chip

I could turn on and off.

RIKER'S COM VOICE

Riker to Data.

DATA

(taps combadge)

Go ahead, Commander.

We're reading some kind of gas

leak in the Environmental Control

Room. Take a repair team down and

check it out.

DATA

(to Porter)

One of the diathermic oxygen tanks

has been damaged.

PORTER

(shocked)

Diathermic oxygen?

DATA

It is a new subsystem of Nova

Class ships. It regulates

hydropressure and temperature

variance.

(beat)

Remain here. The gas is highly

corrosive to organic material. It

would liquefy your flesh on

contact.

PORTER

Be my guest, sir.

DATA

(to Porter)

Begin a diagnostic on the safety

interlocks. There appears to have

been some damage during the

attack.

PORTER

Right.

GEORDI

This must be it.

PICARD

How serious is the damage?

GEORDI

(off tricorder)

I'm having trouble scanning

underground. There's a lot of

radiation leaking from something.

PICARD

Probably from the nuclear warhead.

Cochrane was planning to use it to

ignite the warp drive.

BEVERLY

This will protect us from the

radiation.

GEORDI

I'm picking up faint life signs

twenty meters below.

PICARD

There should be an access hatch

nearby...

LANGE

Over here.

GEORDI

Alphanumeric lock. We need a

BEVERLY

There's a life sign behind this

door... about ten meters below.

GEORDI

Blast door. It's designed to

protect the control room when the

missile is launched.

PICARD

There should be some kind of

manual release...

PICARD

(to Lange)

Get those fires out and then try

to restore main power to the

control room.

LANGE

Aye, sir.

GEORDI

Got it, Captain.

BEVERLY

Severe radiation exposure...

PICARD

It's Cochrane.

BEVERLY

I've stabilized him for now... but

he's in a coma and he's going to

need radiometric therapy. I want

to take him to the ship.

PICARD

Picard to Enterprise.

(no response)

Enterprise, please respond.

GEORDI

It could be the radiation,

Captain. Try from the surface.

PICARD

Mister La Forge, listen very

carefully. If you remember your

history... in less than twenty-

four hours, a Vulcan ship will be

passing through this system. When

it does, this ship needs to be in

space, flying at warp speed.

GEORDI

I'd better get started.

PICARD

It's not the radiation... and

there's nothing wrong with the

combadges... the Enterprise just

isn't responding.

BEVERLY

Jean-Luc, this man needs medical

attention, now.

PICARD

As I recall, the town of

Resurrection is about two

kilometers East of here. They

might have a hospital...

BEVERLY

What are we waiting for? Let's

go.

PICARD

It may not be that simple. This

is an extremely difficult and

paranoid time in human history.

BEVERLY

Are you saying they won't help us?

PICARD

I'm saying they might shoot us on

sight. You have to remember...

these people have watched their

entire way of life collapse around

them.

BEVERLY

There must be some good people...

even in this time.

PICARD

Let's hope so. Because if

Cochrane dies... the future may

die with him.

WORF

I have assigned two damage control

teams to locate the source of our

communication problems. So far,

they've had no success.

RIKER

Assign another team if you need

to. I want to re-establish

communication with the Captain as

soon as possible.

TROI

Are we in any danger of being

detected by Earth defense systems?

WORF

There were no planetary defense

systems in this era. Their

weapons were designed to

fight each other... not

extraterrestrials.

RIKER

We have to start thinking about a

way to get home.

(to Troi)

Analyze our readings from the

temporal vortex. We're going to

have to recreate whatever the Borg

did to --

RIKER

Report.

TROI

(off console)

We just lost main power... and

we've got Class-Three alerts all

over the ship. I'm not sure

what's --

WORF

A ship-wide decompression has been

initiated!

RIKER

What?

TROI

We're venting our internal

atmosphere directly into space!

What the hell is happening, Worf?

WORF

(off console)

It appears that someone has taken

over the Environmental Control

Room.

TROI

Someone...?

RIKER

(realizing)

The Borg.  Some of them must've

beamed over before we destroyed

their ship.

(to Worf)

Seal off that entire deck with

emergency force fields.

It looks like he has a cranial

be sure.

Get Ruby in here.

BEVERLY

He has a severe fracture of the

hemorrhaging... but the radiation

has damaged his KNA and his APR

"APR cell count?" What the hell

are you talking about?

Doctor Crusher has been...

studying some advanced medical

Not really. I was born and raised

California. San Francisco.

Beautiful city. Used to be,

anyway. I didn't think anyone

still lived there.

There's a few of us left.

That was a pretty clever trick you

How'd you do it?

It wasn't a trick. I used to be

Huh.

SCRIMM

And what were you doing out at the

I'm an old friend of Cochrane's...

I wanted to see how he was doing.

SCRIMM

Lucky for him you came by when you

did. He might be dead now.

PICARD

Yes.

SCRIMM

Maybe you can tell me what he's

been doing in that silo. We heard

some explosions out there this

morning...

PICARD

I think he was running a test on

an old rocket engine... and one of

the fuel cells burst.

SCRIMM

You seem to have an answer for

everything.

PICARD

Something wrong with that?

SCRIMM

Not yet.

SCRIMM

Thank you. But I've never had

This used to be the throttle valve

It controls the thrust of the

vaporized... and without it,

there's no way to launch the ship.

Can you reconstruct the throttle

RUBY

You should pay closer attention to

those little red lights.

RUBY

You know, I'd be perfectly

justified in shooting you right

now.

PICARD

I'd say you already have.

RUBY

Don't flatter yourself. I take

pictures of a lot of junk.

RUBY

Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you

have a great explanation for why

those rocket photos are so

important you broke into my house.

PICARD

We're trying to repair Doctor

Cochrane's ship. It's been

damaged and --

RUBY

We?

PICARD

Myself... and a few other friends

of Zephram's.

RUBY

Friends from Cornell...

PICARD

Some.

RUBY

Lie. That's one. Keep going.

PICARD

A key piece of the ship has been

destroyed... and our only hope to

reconstruct it is if one of your

photographs shows us what it

looked like.

RUBY

(considers)

All right. Truth. I believe that

one. Why is it so urgent you

couldn't wait until morning?

PICARD

We have to launch his ship by

tomorrow afternoon.

RUBY

Or...?

PICARD

Or the shielding around the

plutonium core will begin to

deteriorate. Within a day, the

entire silo will become so

radioactive that no one will be

able to come near it for a hundred

years.

RUBY

Lie. That's two. One more, and

I pull the trigger.

Picard is starting to get angry.

PICARD

Why are you being so difficult?

All I'm asking for is to look at

one of the photographs. It'll

take five minutes.

RUBY

And all I'm asking for is the

truth. That would take five

minutes.

(beat)

For all I know, you caused the

explosions at the silo... and now

you're trying to steal Zephram's

ship.

PICARD

I am not a thief...

RUBY

No, you're a petty burglar and a

liar...

(beat)

You're no friend of Zephram's. He

is a great man. He's not like you

or me or any of the other zombies

walking around this town.

PICARD

No. He's a man with vision. He

can see beyond the problems that

surround us. He knows there's a

better future out there for

everyone... a future where crime,

poverty and war are things of the

past... a future where we reach

out and seek our destiny in the

stars.

(beat)

I believe in that future, too,

Ruby. I believe in it in every

fiber of my being. And I'm

telling you... if we don't launch

that warp ship tomorrow, there's

a very good chance that future

will never happen.

PICARD

You won't regret this.

It doesn't make sense. The

WORF

We have to stop them from sending

RIKER

Agreed. Options?

WORF

Destroy the deflector dish.

TROI

Can we aim our dorsal phasers at

it?

RIKER

We've lost control of all weapons

systems... Transporters are

down... we can't get to a

Shuttlecraft... and it would take

us too long to fight our way down

to deflector control...

WORF

There is another way, Commander.
