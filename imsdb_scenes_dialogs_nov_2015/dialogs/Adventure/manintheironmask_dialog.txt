FIRST DRAFT

September 18, 1995

DOCTOR

The head is born!  One arm... the

other arm... it is a boy!

ADVISOR 1

I shall tell the king!

ADVISOR 2

I shall tell him!

DOCTOR

M'lady...?

DOCTOR

Another...?  It is another!

SMASH TO:

MUSKETEER

Away.

TIME DISSOLVE:

1662

TWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER

KEEPER

You dead yet?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

No, Keeper.

DISSOLVE TO:

PARIS

D'ARTAGNAN

Porthos too!

PORTHOS

Ah ha!  Here we are!  Aramis!

Porthos is here!

PORTHOS

Aaaaaaaramis!!  Porthos is --

PORTHOS

Sorry, my dears.  You would have

enjoyed it too.  He's hung like a

donkey.

WENCH 1

So are you.

PORTHOS

Really?  I haven't been able to see

it for fifteen years.  Go on now,

leave His Holiness alone.  I'll

bring you back tomorrow when he's in

a better mood.

PORTHOS

Please revel with me, Aramis, I need

my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm

weak, my strength is gone --

ARAMIS

Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you

see I'm praying?

PORTHOS

I just said you're praying!  Are you

deaf too?  I know you're blind,

because if you had seen the tits

that just walked out of here, you'd

have tears in your eyes.

ARAMIS

(trying to ignore him)

There are more important things than

tits.

PORTHOS

Really?  If you can name me one

thing, one single thing, that is

more sublime than the feel of a

plump pink nipple between my lips,

I will buy you a new cathedral.

ARAMIS

Forgiveness.

PORTHOS

Forgiveness?

PORTHOS

(beat)

Forgive me.

PORTHOS

Am I forgiven?

PORTHOS

I observe your forgiveness isn't

sweeter than a plump nipple.

ARAMIS

Can't you see I'm praying,

goddammit?!

PORTHOS AND ARAMIS

D'Artagnan.

PORTHOS

How are you, you skinny little pup!

ARAMIS

A simple theological discussion.

D'ARTAGNAN

Aramis -- the King wishes to see

you.

ARAMIS

Still you serve him loyally --

though people hurl rotten eggs at

his royal emblem.

D'ARTAGNAN

I see your mind is sharp as ever.

The King said, "Right away."  Cut

deep and hard, my friends.

PORTHOS

Deep and hard, D'Artagnan.

PORTHOS

We were all Musketeers once, eh?  Oh,

I forgot.  For the poor, the ones

you were praying for.

PORTHOS

I wonder how Athos is doing.

RAOUL

Do I look all right?

ATHOS

None of the ladies will be able to

take their eyes off you.

RAOUL

I care only about Michelle.  Should

I ask her when we first arrive?

Or... or when we're leaving?  I

could ask her in the carriage -- but

it is more romantic at the palace.

I get so confused...

ATHOS

Perhaps this will help.

RAOUL

Mother's ring.  I can't take this.

ATHOS

She died giving you to me.  And I

want to die knowing it is one the

finger of the women my son loves.

ATHOS

Now go, and bring back your fiance.

PIERRE

Your Majesty, I know it is a... a

festive time, but before --

KING LOUIS

The blue sash.  No, the burgundy!

PIERRE

... before the party begins --

KING LOUIS

The party has already begun -- so

why are you delaying me?

PIERRE

We do not wish to delay you,

Majesty, but... as your advisors, we

feel it is our -- our --

CLAUDE

... our duty.

PIERRE

Yes!  It is our duty to let you

know... there are riots in Paris.

LOUIS

Riots?  My people live in the

world's most beautiful city, their

king has the grandest palaces on

earth.  Why should they feel

anything but pride and contentment?

PIERRE

Well yes, of course, Majesty, and

I'm sure they are content... except

that... well, they are starving.

LOUIS

Sometimes the poor do grow hungry.

But why would they riot about it?

PIERRE

Majesty... We have more than enough

food set aside for your birthday

celebration next week.  If we

distributed some of that, we would

have time to gather more before --

LOUIS

Aramis!  I have been expecting you!

(to the tailors)

We are satisfied, that will do.

ARAMIS

Your birthday celebration, your

Majesty?

LOUIS

Next week.  This is a mere garden

party -- and I wish to join it, so I

will be brief.  I am experiencing

resistance from the Jesuits.

ARAMIS

Well... perhaps you should speak

with them, your Majesty.

LOUIS

I have demanded it -- and common

priests present themselves!  Can you

imagine the arrogance?  Common

Jesuit priests try to act as my

equals, and they refuse to reveal

the names of anyone else in their

order!  No one can keep secrets like

the Jesuits can, and the identity of

their leader is the darkest secret

they hold.  Even the Pope himself

does not know who leads the Jesuit

Order in France!  He suspects the

Governor General of Jesuits, whoever

he is, is angling to become Pope

himself.

ARAMIS

How can I serve you in this?

LOUIS

Perhaps you can find out who this

secret leader of the Jesuits is.

You are now a priest, but you were

once a Musketeer, serving the throne

of France, a throne ordained of God.

Can you accept this mission, and

keep it private?

ARAMIS

If I find out the identity of this

Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him

and the man who told me.

LOUIS

Once a Musketeer, always a

Musketeer, eh?

LOUIS

Ah yes, the riots.  We have food

stocks on the wharves right now, no?

PIERRE

That food has spoiled.  That is why

it was not shipped to the army.

LOUIS

Exactly why it should be given away.

PIERRE

What... an excellent idea, your

Majesty!

MICHELLE

Isn't it glorious!

RAOUL

Michelle...

LOUIS

Who is that?

FRIEND 1

Raoul, son of Athos.

LOUIS

Not the soldier, you idiot!

FRIEND 2

Her name is Michelle.

D'ARTAGNAN

Your Majesty...

LOUIS

What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins

falling from the sky now?

D'ARTAGNAN

The plans for use of the maze were

not disclosed to me.

LOUIS

I decided it this morning.

D'ARTAGNAN

Then you must allow me to stay close

to you so that --

LOUIS

I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will

change my mind as I wish, and I will

enjoy my banquet as I wish!

D'ARTAGNAN

But I deployed the Royal Guards

according to your previous --

LOUIS

Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let

us pretend I am King and you are

Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us

behave as if my wish is law.  And my

wish is to enjoy this party!

RAOUL

Michelle, I... Ever since I returned

I've been wanting to speak with you

about... about --

SERVANT

Monsieur, Mademoiselle...?

RAOUL

No!  Thank you -- Michelle, I --

LOUIS

It pleases us to announce an

entertainment for our guests!  A

contest of agility and cunning!

LOUIS

Behold our unicorn!  Whichever of

our guests captures the unicorn

shall win its treasure!

MICHELLE

I have never seen a diamond so

large!

LOUIS

Into the maze!  All of you!

Disperse, I command you!

LOUIS

Are you men or mice?!

RAOUL

The pendant will be yours!

LOUIS

Michelle, isn't it?

LOUIS

I would have said it was impossible,

but I believe the excitement of the

chase has made you even more

beautiful.

MICHELLE

Sire, I --

LOUIS

You blush!  You do not wish to be

beautiful to your King?

LOUIS

Wait!  Michelle, I --

ASSASSIN

Feed... your... people.

ASSASSIN

Your people starve...!  Feed --

LOUIS

A pitiful madman, nothing more.

Come, let us continue our chase!

Where is our unicorn?

YOUNG MUSKETEER

Captain!

YOUNG MUSKETEER

You are the best --

KEEPER

Food, moron.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

Thank you, Keeper.

KEEPER

Look what you've done!

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

I'm sorry, Keeper...

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

No, Keeper, it's my only book!

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

What number did you tear out?

KEEPER

Eh?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

What number, on the first page?

KEEPER

... Two-thirty-seven.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the

descendants of Japeth are these:

Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."

KEEPER

You've... memorized...?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

What was the end page?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

Six-two-one:  "... Though I speak

with the tongues of men and angels,

and have not love, I am but a

clanging cymbal or --"

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

We're playing, Keeper!  A game!

Take another page, any page!  Keeper

and I are playing a game!

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

A game, a game, we're playing a --

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

Keeper...?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

No... No!  Keeper, please, you

cannot die!  You're my only friend!

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

Help!  Someone!  Keeper is dead!

ATTENDANT

She wishes a word with you.

D'ARTAGNAN

M'lady...?

ANNE

I understand you saved my son's life

today.

D'ARTAGNAN

God smiled upon us.

ANNE

And you were not hurt?

D'ARTAGNAN

No, M'lady.

ANNE

That is good.

LIEUTENANT

Duty lists of the day, Captain!

D'ARTAGNAN

Thank you, Andre.

D'ARTAGNAN

Wait.  There is an entry here --

"Messenger sent by King to residence

of Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort."

Why was that?

LIEUTENANT

Well, Captain...

ATHOS

D'Artagnan!

D'ARTAGNAN

Athos, my friend!

D'ARTAGNAN

It's been too long.

ATHOS

Life is too long.  Except when we

have our friends.  Look at you!

You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll

open a bottle of wine.

D'ARTAGNAN

Thanks, but not for me.

ATHOS

You can't drink with a friend you

haven't seen in months?

D'ARTAGNAN

I have ordered a drill of the Royal

Guard for midnight, and must be

clear-headed for it.

ATHOS

Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the

youngsters hard, eh?

D'ARTAGNAN

They must stay sharp.  There was an

attempt on the King's life today.

ATHOS

Another?  How many times have you

saved his life in this year alone?

Three?  Four?

D'ARTAGNAN

I heard your playing.

ATHOS

I was feeling sorry for myself.

Raoul is getting married, he

proposed today!  I love that boy

beyond all measure, I've spent

everything I own to give him

education and opportunity.  Now he

has complete happiness, and I mope.

D'ARTAGNAN

Athos...

ATHOS

That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look,

d'Artagnan's come to visit...!

What's wrong?  You look awful!

RAOUL

Michelle, she -- The king has

invited her to come live in the

palace.

ATHOS

But -- are you sure?

RAOUL

We were at her door.  I was just

taking the ring from my pocket, for

the third time today, when a young

Musketeer brought the invitation for

her to become a lady-in-waiting for

the Queen Mother.

ATHOS

Michelle cannot possibly accept!

RAOUL

She cannot possibly refuse.  Her

family is poor, they have even less

money than we do.  And along with

the invitation, the King sent the

diamond pendant, from the piglet.

ATHOS

Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?

RAOUL

Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter

now.  She loved me once.  I want to

die remembering that.

ATHOS

Die?  What...?

RAOUL

I have rejoined the army, and asked

to resume my commission at the head

of the troops of General Fromberge.

ATHOS

Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.

RAOUL

It is already done.  I have just

stopped at Mother's grave, to say

goodbye, before coming to tell you.

ATHOS

Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No

matter how your heart is broken --

RAOUL

Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.

ATHOS

Raoul --

ATHOS

This cannot be.  Everyone knows the

Queen Mother is a recluse, and the

ladies-in-waiting are but

mistresses for the king!

D'ARTAGNAN

If the young woman truly loves

Raoul --

ATHOS

She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a

poor family.  You may still be young

enough to believe love conquers

everything, but I am old and hard

and I've seen too much.  Even when

kings are hunchbacks they have any

woman they desire, because power

seduces even more than love!

ATHOS

You knew this was happening.  You

knew and that's why you came.

D'ARTAGNAN

I fear I know our King.  I came to

try to bring you hope.

ATHOS

What hope is there?  A wartime

commission cannot be vacated except

by the king, and what chance is

there of that?  Fromberge is on the

battle line, and Raoul --

D'ARTAGNAN

I have dispatches a message to

Fromberge requesting that Raoul be

kept far from the fighting.

ATHOS

Raoul is everything to me.

D'ARTAGNAN

I know.

ATHOS

Oh my friend.

D'ARTAGNAN

I will also speak with the King, for

he is surely unaware of the problems

his invitation to Mademoiselle

Beaufort has caused.

ATHOS

You trust his character more than

anyone else does.

D'ARTAGNAN

Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I

must hurry too.

ATHOS

Save my son, d'Artagnan.

LIEUTENANT

Here is food, the gift of your

loving King, on his birthday!  He

gives to himself by giving to you,

in that he loves you so much!

LIEUTENANT

No need to fight, there is plenty

for all!

RUFFIAN

This stuff stinks.  It is rotting!

The King gives us rotten food!

PANICKED SOLDIER

Back, toward the palace!  We cannot

hold them off!  We will fire a

volley into them!

D'ARTAGNAN

No!  Run to the palace and close the

gates.  But do not fire!

RUFFIAN

Come on!  To the palace!

MOB

It's d'Artagnan!  Le Generale de

Musketeers!

RUFFIAN

One Musketeer can't stop us!

D'ARTAGNAN

Stop you?  You are Frenchmen, are

you not?  I am one of you.

RUFFIAN

The King is a Frenchman, but he is

not one of us!

D'ARTAGNAN

Citizens of Paris!  Give ear to me!

RUFFIAN

We'll give you their ears!

D'ARTAGNAN

Wait -- and listen!  I beg you!

RIOTER

They give us garbage, not fit for

rats!  They think we are garbage!

D'ARTAGNAN

I'm on my way to a salad!  Doesn't

anybody have any endive?

D'ARTAGNAN

A tomato?

D'ARTAGNAN

You are right.  It is rotten.  I

will speak to the King myself.  You

have my word.

D'ARTAGNAN

And you will release those men --

for they serve France... and you.

RIOTERS

Three cheers for d'Artagnan!

Hurrah...!!  Hurrah...!!

CLAUDE

We already know about the riots!

D'ARTAGNAN

Does he know?

PIERRE

We will tell him, when it is...

CLAUDE

Convenient.

YOUNG WOMAN

Oh yes!  So good!  Ooo, wonderful,

Marvelous!  Fan-tas --

YOUNG WOMAN

Oh, Louis, that was incredible.  It

was better than ever before.  It --

LOUIS

I'm hungry.

YOUNG WOMAN

I will have food brought.

LOUIS

I like to eat alone.

LOUIS

By the way, you'll be moving

tomorrow.

LOUIS

Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages

were constructed for the King's

security, not so you could step from

my father's portrait and startle me

to death!

D'ARTAGNAN

It is for your security that I have

come, your Majesty -- for the

security of your honor.

LOUIS

I already know about the riots,

d'Artagnan, I heard them out there

whispering.  Some fool gave the

order to distribute rotten food.  I

will deal with it tomorrow.

D'ARTAGNAN

Then there is one more thing, of an

even more personal nature.

LOUIS

A personal nature?

D'ARTAGNAN

Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She

is betrothed to Raoul, the son of

Athos the Musketeer, who has served

France through many tribulations.

LOUIS

Betrothed?  I think not.

D'ARTAGNAN

In his mind, anyway, and soon enough

in hers.  She had written him many

letters of love.

LOUIS

Miss Beaufort has accepted our

invitation.  By this we can only

suppose that she wishes to come --

as we wish her to be here.

D'ARTAGNAN

Your Majesty has had many women --

LOUIS

That is my desire, and my desire is

what should concern you, not the

sentiments of some commoner!

D'ARTAGNAN

It is not Raoul's heart alone that

concerns me.  It is yours.  I know

you find women compliant --

especially the poorer ones like

Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do

you love them?  What about a queen

to love?  A son of your own?

LOUIS

What quaint notions, d'Artagnan!

But they contradict my father, who

picked his queen when he was old,

and only then to bear me.

D'ARTAGNAN

There is more to love than he knew,

or that you know.

LOUIS

You dare criticize my father?!  Or

lecture me?!

D'ARTAGNAN

Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love

your people, and you will not bear

to see them hungry.  Love women, and

they will love you.  Love yourself,

and --

LOUIS

That is enough!  You are a good

servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget

your place!

D'ARTAGNAN

At least help Raoul.

LOUIS

Silence!  I order you!

D'ARTAGNAN

Order Fromberge to keep him in

safety!  It is the least you can do,

to protect your own honor!

LOUIS

I will consider it.  Now leave me.

D'ARTAGNAN

Thank you, your Majesty.

CUT TO:

PIERRE

... And I only say that... the

rotten food was... all my fault...

and I take... full responsibility...

and beg the forgiveness of you all.

LOUIS

Well done, Pierre.  It will be good

for your soul, that you have taken

responsibility for your errors.  And

don't worry, I will look after your

family.

LOUIS

Do not rejoice -- but know that your

King does not tolerate blunders that

hurt his beloved people.  More food

is on its way, and my advisors tell

me the new harvests are sure to be

bountiful!

LOUIS

And I have new joys to announce to

you!  Today we decree a fresh glory

for Paris, and for all of France!

The laying of the foundations to

expand Versailles, and make it truly

a palace of the sun!

VOICE

Aramis.

ARAMIS

Your Majesty...

LOUIS

How goes that favor I asked of you?

ARAMIS

I grow closer to my target, your

Majesty.

LOUIS

You bring me the heart of the Jesuit

General, and you will have a palace

of your own.

fingertips...

upon the posts of the bed...

HANDMAIDEN

After your bath put on this, it is

the King's favorite color.  That

letter on the desk came here for you

this morning.

MICHELLE

Raoul!

MICHELLE

The army!  Oh Raoul, don't despair!

I will always be faithful...

CUT TO:

HANDMAIDEN

If you need me further, just ring.

MICHELLE

Sire!  I -- How did you --

LOUIS

How did I get in?  You're new here,

and will soon learn many secrets.

What is that?

MICHELLE

... Nothing.

LOUIS

A letter.  May I see?

LOUIS

From Raoul.  He urges you to guard

your honor -- as if it could be in

any danger... from your king.

MICHELLE

Raoul... is in love...

LOUIS

Enough of this, our dinner waits.

LOUIS

The food doesn't please you?

MICHELLE

It's lovely.  It's just...

LOUIS

This is more than you are used to.

Your mother is a seamstress, your

father is dead.  You have three

younger sisters, two of whom suffer

from consumption.  Don't look so

surprised, Kings know such things.

MICHELLE

I... we are humble people...

LOUIS

Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The

straits of your family need not be

permanent.  It is a simple matter to

have them brought to one of my

country estates, where they may have

fine meals, and physicians to look

after them.

MICHELLE

You would do that, your Majesty?

LOUIS

My dear, I've already done it.

LOUIS

Please, darling, that isn't

necessary.  We are friends now.

Mademoiselle needs wine!

LOUIS

You are beautiful.  You know you

are.

MICHELLE

Sire, I --

LOUIS

If you don't want to be so

appealing, why did you touch the

rose to your skin?  Where was it?

Here?

LOUIS

What is it?  Raoul?  If he really

loved you, he would have proposed

marriage.  He didn't, did he?

LOUIS

You have never known love until you

have known the love of a king.

JAILER

It's a jolt at first, so brace

yourself.

NEW KEEPER

Ugh!  He looks 'orrible.

NEW KEEPER

Stay back!

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

I frighten you.  It's okay.  Keeper

was scared of me too, at first.

NEW KEEPER

Scared?

NEW KEEPER

Scared of you?  Not me.  I'll kill

him if he gets near me.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

I miss Keeper.  I miss him so much.

JAILER

Moron.

STAFF OFFICER

Here.

RAOUL

Mi-cheeelllll!! --

CUT TO:

LIEUTENANT

Sir... a casualty report came...

D'ARTAGNAN

No, no, no...

D'ARTAGNAN

Saddle my horse!

D'ARTAGNAN

Hurry --

D'ARTAGNAN

Athos, my friend --

D'ARTAGNAN

Athos, please...!

ATHOS

Get out of my way.

D'ARTAGNAN

(grabbing him)

Athos, I beg you --

D'ARTAGNAN

Where are you going?

ATHOS

To kill the king.

D'ARTAGNAN

Athos!  I know life means nothing to

you at this moment, but I will not

let you kill yourself.

ATHOS

The King killed my son!

D'ARTAGNAN

The cannons killed Raoul!  The

cannons, and love.  But not the King.

YOUNG MUSKETEER

I'll kill the old man for you,

Captain, if you don't wish to --

ATHOS

Come on!  All of you!

ATHOS

Coward!  Fight me!  Fight me...!

ATHOS

He killed my son, d'Artagnan!  He

killed my son...!

D'ARTAGNAN

Get back, all of you!

D'ARTAGNAN

Let him go!

LOUIS

What?!

VOICE

Your Majesty... it is Andre.

MICHELLE

Shall I leave?

LOUIS

No, you may wait behind the screen.

LIEUTENANT

I would not have disturbed you,

Majesty, but you ordered me to keep

you informed --

LOUIS

Yes, yes, go on.

LIEUTENANT

Athos, the former Musketeer, has

just fought with several of your

guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.

LOUIS

Did they kill him?

LIEUTENANT

No.  He cut an ear from one of the

men, no one else was hurt.  Captain

d'Artagnan allowed him to leave.

Athos was upset about the death of

his son, at the front.

LOUIS

Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me!

Did he try to enter the palace?

LIEUTENANT

... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan

blocked his way.

LOUIS

You may go, Lieutenant.

LIEUTENANT

Do you want Athos arrested, your

Majesty?

LOUIS

Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan

to do it.

LOUIS

My dear!  The glass -- !

MICHELLE

Did you know... about Raoul?

LOUIS

I did not want to upset you.  It was

tragic.  I did everything I could

for him.  I ordered him positioned

in a spot of complete safety, far

from the fighting.  But he

disregarded my wishes and charged

into danger.

LOUIS

I will order a Mass for his soul.

It will guarantee his place in

Heaven.

MICHELLE

Oh Louis, Louis...

PORTHOS

Aramis... is this the way to hell?

ARAMIS

Hell may be our destination, dear

Porthos, but not this trip.

PORTHOS

Where are we?

ARAMIS

Jesus of Nazareth found the holy

among the profane.  If we are to

have a place of private prayer,

where better than here, beside the

channels where the shit and the

garbage run to the river?

PORTHOS

Mother of God!

ARAMIS

It is also a place of burial.

PORTHOS

A tomb?  We're in a tomb?

ARAMIS

Catacombs.  Very holy.

PORTHOS

Yaaaahhh!

ARAMIS

Relax, you big fool, it's

d'Artagnan.

ARAMIS

It's all right.  D'Artagnan was the

one who warned us that he'd been

given an order for your arrest.

Here you have sanctuary -- does he

not, d'Artagnan?

ARAMIS

Look at us.  We are old men now.  But

once we were young.  And when we saw

injustice, we fought it.

D'ARTAGNAN

We have grown wiser with age.  Now

we know that some problems cannot be

settled with a sword.

ATHOS

And some problems cannot be settled

without one.

ARAMIS

Well here is the problem at hand:

the King has ordered me to discover

the identity of the Governor General

of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our

English rivals have left the

Catholic Church, Louis has struck on

a plan to dominate the whole of

Europe by uniting Church and State

and making himself head of both.  He

has already picked the Pope.  Only

the Jesuits, who put God above

throne or papacy, stand in his way.

PORTHOS

But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope

and King?

ARAMIS

So they tell us.  But what are we to

believe when the king is a tyrant,

and the Church, meant to stand for

all those oppressed, has become the

tool of oppression?  When no

conscience is tolerated?  No

dissent, no objection?

PORTHOS

It is a weighty problem, Aramis --

but perhaps you should leave it to

this secret General of the Jesuits,

whoever he might be.

ARAMIS

Easy to say, but hard to do.  For

what I am trying to tell you is that

I am the Governor General of Jesuits

in France.

ATHOS

What do you propose to do?

ARAMIS

Replace the king.

D'ARTAGNAN

I cannot hear this!

PORTHOS

It can't be done.

ARAMIS

It can.  I know the way.

ATHOS

I am with you!

D'ARTAGNAN

No!  Stop --

ARAMIS

I will need you all.  All for one.

One for all.

D'ARTAGNAN

(jumping up)

You -- You cannot ask me to betray

my king!  I have sworn to him!

ATHOS

It is honor you serve, and when the

king is dishonorable you are removed

from your oath of honor!

D'ARTAGNAN

An oath is an oath precisely because

it cannot be removed!

ATHOS

Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?!

I know you have put service above

your own life, but why does this

King deserve such loyalty?  He is a

monster!  He executes ministers for

his own blunders, with their

families hostage so they take the

blame!  He has no honor!

D'ARTAGNAN

No man is all bad... or all good.  I

believe -- I must believe -- that

Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can

help him.

ATHOS

Whatever the plan... I am in it!

The next time we meet, one of us

will die.

ARAMIS

Porthos, see to Athos, won't you?

ARAMIS

I have heard many confessions,

d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not

a priest, I could tell your heart

has a secret weight, and it is

hurting you to carry it alone.

D'ARTAGNAN

The secret I carry I cannot share.

Not even with God.

D'ARTAGNAN

I cannot betray Louis.  I will

defend him with my life.

ARAMIS

I know.  God go with you.

ARAMIS

This way.

ATHOS

What are they doing?

ARAMIS

Making the key to the throne.

PORTHOS

They are very large keys.

ATHOS

Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't

you think it's time you told me what

it is you are plotting?

ARAMIS

Soon enough.  Here we are.

ATHOS

The Prison of Belle Sur.

ARAMIS

Come, we have a boat waiting.

ATHOS

What is that?

ARAMIS

A body.

ATHOS

I see that is a body!  But where did

you get it?

PORTHOS

He gets one day of confession each

year.  Today is the day.

ATHOS

Who does?

PORTHOS

Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even

talk about it.

ATHOS

What do we do now?

PORTHOS

I don't know about you, but I plan

to wait here.

HEAD GUARD

Who is this, then?

GUARD

He says he's the replacement.

GUARD

He says it is only one day a month

when the prisoner gets confession,

and the little one is too sick to

move.  The big one doesn't speak

French either.

HEAD GUARD

Then let's get it done.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

My confession day!  But where is the

other one?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

I know you don't speak my language

-- but is the other one all right?

Please tell me he is not dead too,

or I will have lost everyone.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

I... tore my Bible.  Or someone else

did.  But it was all right.  "Let the

words of my mouth and the

meditations of my heart be

acceptable in Thy sight, Oh Lord our

God and My Redeemer."

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

I'm sorry.  You're never seen me

before.  I must frighten you.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

What are you doing?  Why do you --

ARAMIS

I am a friend, here to help you.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

What -- ?

ARAMIS

It is an escape.  To freedom.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

Freedom...?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

Wh-- ?  He is dead!  Who is he?

ARAMIS

He is you.

ARAMIS

Hey!  Hey!

GUARD

What now?

GUARD

He says he just fell stone dead as

he was reading him the Mass.

HEAD GUARD

I never thought the bugger would

last this long.  But how could he

just keel over and --

GUARD

He says the prisoner has the fever,

just like the little priest does.

HEAD GUARD

Plague?  They brought plague in

here?  Get him out of here.  Now!

GUARD

No, no last rites!  Get away!

ATHOS

My God...

ARAMIS

It's all right.  Take your time.

ARAMIS

Athos... He needs a gentle hand.

GUARD 1

You ever wonder who he was?

GUARD 2

No... Yes.  But I never asked -- and

you better not either.

THE UNSEEN PRISONER IS DEAD.

ARAMIS

Jesuits.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

No!  Please!

ARAMIS

What is wrong?  We only mean to free

you from the mask!

ATHOS

Prison was horrible but it was his

home.  He's been torn from it by

strangers.  He's frightened,

exhausted -- and the mask is

familiar.  Let him rest in it

tonight, and remove it tomorrow.

ARAMIS

Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen

sense of this man.

ATHOS

His plight is obvious, isn't it?

ARAMIS

And why are you so glum?

PORTHOS

I expected action.  There was no

killing, no fighting, I was useless.

ATHOS

Are you hungry?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

Just... water.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

This way.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

This place... I once lived in a

country house.  I had guardians --

an old man and woman.  And tutors.

But no friends.  Then when I was

twelve, they came and took me to the

prison.

ATHOS

Who came?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

A man in black.  I never saw his

face.  He took me to the cell.  A

blacksmith came and they put me into

the mask.  For days I shouted, "What

have I done?  Why do you do this to

me?"  But no one heard, so I just

stopped shouting.

ATHOS

And you never knew why?

PRISONER

I thought... there is something

about my face that men do not want

to see.  Something that makes them

cruel.  But then I realized they

were cruel even when I was wearing

the mask.  I knew there must be some

other reason, but I could not think

what it was.

ATHOS

What is your name?

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

The old man and woman called me...

Phillippe.

ATHOS

Phillippe.  Rest now.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

Thank you... for your kindness.

D'ARTAGNAN

My friends... Where have you gone?

CUT TO:

LOUIS

Take this to my mother.

NUN

M'lady... are you...?

ANNE

Please, just... go away.

ARAMIS

See?  There is plenty of food in the

country.  But the King keeps it

going to the army instead of --

ATHOS

He is sleeping.  Now see here,

Aramis, it's time you told us --

PORTHOS

I have no appetite for food, I am

wasting away.  Say goodbye to

Porthos, for he is gone.  Even women

don't interest me now.

PORTHOS

I tell you a secret.  I sleep with

three women at once, not because my

appetite is so great, but because

now it take three to excite me.

ATHOS

Who is he, Aramis?

ARAMIS

Tomorrow.

ATHOS

Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man

from a royal prison, we hide in a

country chateau among an assortment

of saints and sluts such as only you

could provide, and still you wish to

tell me nothing?!

ARAMIS

You seek facts, when it would be

better to seek truth.

ATHOS

You are not my priest, Aramis!  You

would not be, even if I had one.

ARAMIS

You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn

by grief, not only for Raoul, but

for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and

now treat as an enemy.

ATHOS

He who is not with us is against us.

ARAMIS

Those are the words of a broken

spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have

trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest

secrets, and I will never believe

he is my enemy.

ATHOS

Then you are a fool -- a fool who

has never lost a son.  What gives

you the right to judge me, to play

God with the lives of others?  Is it

because you are so much holier than

everyone else?!

ARAMIS

There is that, of course -- but

mainly it is because I am so much

smarter than everyone else.

ARAMIS

Porthos?!

PORTHOS

Kidney rocks.  It hurts when I pee.

It hurts when I shit.  I'm just a

fat old fart with nothing to live

for any more.  I'm going to hang

myself, as soon as I'm sober.

NUN

M'lady...?

ANNE

Oh God I -- Forgive me...

D'ARTAGNAN

M'lady...?

D'ARTAGNAN

What -- ?

ANNE

No, stay back!  Stay back!

ANNE

D'Artagnan!

D'ARTAGNAN

M'lady... if anyone sees, it is

death...

ANNE

If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.

D'ARTAGNAN

I can't bear to see you cry.  What

is wrong?

ANNE

Nothing... Nothing.

ANNE

Nothing.  This... didn't happen.  I

must go back now.

D'ARTAGNAN

Anne...!  I know... I know that to

love you is treason against France.

But not to love you... is treason

against my heart.

ANNE

Then we will both die traitors,

d'Artagnan.

LOUIS

What is wrong?

LOUIS

What is wrong?!

MICHELLE

Raoul... Oh, Raoul...

LOUIS

Listen, my darling... Raoul was

a... a good friend.  And now he is

dead and that is very sad but --

MICHELLE

We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.

LOUIS

No, my love.  You will burn in hell,

for your sins.  But I will not --

for I am King.  My position is

ordained by God.

LOUIS

D'Artagnan!  Guards!

LOUIS' VOICE

Help!

LOUIS

Out there!  Look!  Out there!  He --

D'ARTAGNAN

I just left the garden, it was

empty.  What did you see?

LOUIS

It... was nothing.  A nightmare,

nothing more.  Go away, I --

D'ARTAGNAN

Check the garden.

CUT TO:

PORTHOS

Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly

like... exactly like...

ARAMIS

I will answer all your questions.

But first soap, water, and a razor.

ARAMIS

Yes.  Identical.

ARAMIS

The greatest secret of life is who

we truly are.  Now I must give you

that secret, which has been kept

from you your whole life.  It began

on the night when Louis was born.

PORTHOS

I remember that night.  D'Artagnan

was drunk, the only time I've seen

him that way.  The three of us were

reveling, remember, Athos?

ARAMIS

But I was on duty...

ARAMIS' VOICE

I was summoned to the royal

apartments.  Arrange a carriage,

they told me, and wait by the door

of the stables.

ARAMIS' VOICE

They brought a baby from the back of

the palace, into the black carriage

I had waiting.  They had given the

driver instructions about where it

was, and I was ordered to make the

whole journey with the blinds of the

carriage drawn.

ARAMIS' VOICE

I carried that baby into the

countryside, to a chateau, like this

one.  And there I left him.

ARAMIS

I have never forgotten that night,

or what I carried.

PORTHOS

I don't understand.  What does this

have to do with...?  You carried a

baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --

ARAMIS

Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried

the child of the king.

PORTHOS

The child of the king is... the

king.  Louis!

ARAMIS

No, not Louis!

PORTHOS

Athos, do you understand this?  He

confuses me --

ARAMIS

I carried the king's child!  The

queen had twins that night, and one

of them was sent away, in secret!

PORTHOS

But why?

ARAMIS

Because the old king had a twin as

well, and through his whole reign

his brother fought him for the

throne.  Then he had two heirs, not

just sons but twins.  So he decided

that one be put away, as if he never

existed.  You, Phillippe.

ARAMIS' VOICE

The old king ordered you be educated

and well treated, but your identity

kept from you and all those around

you.

ARAMIS' VOICE

On his death bed, he revealed your

existence to Louis and your mother.

Your mother had been told by her own

priest that you had died at birth.

Somehow she blamed herself for ever

believing it, and she wished to

restore your birthright.  But now

Louis was king.

ARAMIS' VOICE

A priest, even a Pope, he could kill

without hesitation, but he was

afraid to kill you, for his whole

claim to power rests on the sanctity

of royal blood.  So he had you

hidden in a way that only a monster

could devise.  I know, for it was I

who took you to prison, and the Iron

Mask.  Someday I will ask your

forgiveness.  But not until we have

restored to you what is yours.

PHILLIPPE

Restored...?

ARAMIS

We will replace Louis with

Phillippe.  No one but the King

himself -- and now we -- knows

Phillippe even exists.  All we have

to do is switch them.

ATHOS

Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is

ludicrous!

ARAMIS

I have it all worked out.

ATHOS

Physical resemblance is but one

small thing!  Louis has an

arrogance, a manner --

ARAMIS

Those can be adopted --

ATHOS

And people close to him, who --

ARAMIS

Do you think I have not considered

that?  I have a plan -- and you may

rest assured that it is brilliant!

ATHOS

It is not just our lives you risk

with this conceit of yours!  It is

Phillippe's as well!

ARAMIS

Yes, and he has a choice!

ARAMIS

What about it, Phillippe?!  All that

time in prison, all that time you

suffered, was it for nothing?!  You

memorized the entire Bible, or so

your priest told me!  An act of

survival, of defiance, of courage!

Your years within the mask have

given you reserves of strength that

others could not imagine.  Your home

was a dungeon and now you may be a

king, if you have the heart to make

it so!  Do you have the heart?

PHILLIPPE

I will try.

ARAMIS

You see?  A king.

ATHOS

Recent hours have been a shock.

PHILLIPPE

Perhaps not as much as you might

imagine.  When tutors answered every

question except those about who I

was.  When I was imprisoned in a way

no other man had ever been, I knew

there was something different about

me.  But a king...

ATHOS

Phillippe... there is something I

hope you understand.  Terrible

cruelty has been used against you.

And... you must understand that you

did nothing to deserve it.

PHILLIPPE

There is... wrath... in me.  I have

learned to hide it.  Those years in

the cell, I dreamed that freedom

would someday just happen, the way

the mask happened.  Now I am free.

And with each free breath I feel the

growing desire to make someone

suffer for all I lost.  Look at

this, all this that for ten years I

could not see!  What if I become a

king -- a king no different from my

brother?

ATHOS

The desire for vengeance... can be a

poison.

PHILLIPPE

What is its antidote?

ATHOS

I suppose... it is to remember there

are many people who have never been

in a prison, who pass such beauty

every day, and never see it.

PHILLIPPE

You look so sad.  Is it something I

have done?

ATHOS

It is something I have done -- or

did not do.

PHILLIPPE

What is that?

ATHOS

I did not share beauty with

someone... who is no longer here for

me to share beauty with.

ATHOS

We have much to do, we'd best get

started.  Now suppose you were to

walk into a garden, as a king...

ARAMIS

More wine!

ARAMIS

How is he?

ATHOS

Resting, he's had a long day.

Aramis --

ARAMIS

(calling out)

More wine!!

ATHOS

You must reconsider this plan.

Phillippe is like a child, he --

ARAMIS

You can do it.

ATHOS

In a year, maybe two, I could teach

him enough to --

ARAMIS

Three days.

ATHOS

Three days??!!

ARAMIS

The King is having a ball, a

masquerade ball.  It is the perfect

opportunity and perhaps our only

one.  At any time Phillippe could be

discovered, and what then?  Remember

France.  Remember the poor.

Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where

are those serving girls...?

PORTHOS

It's no use.  My sword is bent.

SERVING WOMAN

It'll be all right.  You're just

taking a while to get started.

PORTHOS

No, it's dead.  I am useless.

ATHOS

Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's

perceptive, but he is in such

turmoil --

ARAMIS

You grow fond of him.  That's good.

ATHOS

Don't play God with me, Aramis I --

ARAMIS

Go on.

ATHOS

But -- what is Porthos doing?

ARAMIS

Going into the barn naked -- or so

it appears.

ARAMIS

Now.  You were saying?

ATHOS

But -- what is he doing?

ARAMIS

About to hang himself, I should

think.

ATHOS

Hang himself?!

ARAMIS

He's threatened to do it, it's been

building up in him for months.

ATHOS

We must stop him!

ARAMIS

Come now, Athos, if Porthos is

determined to end his life, then he

will certainly manage to find the

opportunity.

ATHOS

But -- but --

PORTHOS

A'dieu, cruel life!  Farewell to

useless Porthos!

ARAMIS

I sawed the main beam in half.

ARAMIS

I'm a genius -- not an engineer!

PORTHOS

Aramis!!  You did this, didn't you!

You knew I would try hanging myself,

and you sawed the beam!  Admit it!

Admit it, by God!!  ADMIT IT!!!

ARAMIS

Well of course I knew it, Porthos.

ARAMIS

You've been moping for months.  Now

that you've gotten the idea of

killing yourself out of the way, you

can stop boring me and start being

useful to me.  Now get some rest.

PORTHOS

Well... Well... Okay.

WENCH

AAAAAAHHHHHHH!

ATHOS

Poor Phillippe!

ARAMIS

The mask is terrifying... especially

when unexpected.  Do you notice?

ATHOS

All I noticed was that Phillippe

feels even more like an animal.

ARAMIS

See, Porthos -- secrets are hard to

keep.  We don't have much time.

PHILLIPPE

I've worn this mask so long, I

couldn't sleep without it.

ATHOS

I will sit with you.  I can't sleep

either.

PHILLIPPE

Athos...?  Thank you for being my

guide... back into the world.

ATHOS

Where are you going?!

ARAMIS

Paris.  There is still much to do.

We'll be back soon.  Be ready.

ATHOS

But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn

in time, but --

ARAMIS

He can learn to be Phillippe in

time.  But first he must learn to be

Louis, and for that he has two more

days.

ATHOS

What you're asking is impossible!

ARAMIS

I offer you the perfect revolution.

A revolution without bloodshed,

without any loss of life, even

without treason, for he too is the

son of the King.

ATHOS

But --

ARAMIS

You said you'd do anything, Athos,

anything to replace this King.  So

do it.

ATHOS

No, wait, do not hold your goblet

that way.  With a king it is... so.

ATHOS

It is not to be dainty.  Servants

have touched the King's goblet, so

he will touch it as little as

possible.

PHILLIPPE

I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --

ATHOS

No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be

sorry!  The King cares for nothing

and for no one!  There are no

mistakes when you are King!  What

you do is right for every person!  A

King has contempt for everyone!

PHILLIPPE

Is that the king of king you wish me

to be?  Or do you say this because

of your son?

ATHOS

How did you know -- ?

PHILLIPPE

Porthos told me.

ATHOS

I am not... I am not angry with you.

You understand?  Good.  Now, as to

acting like a king, we wish you to

be a good king.  But at first... at

first you must pass as Louis, and

Louis is cold and cruel.  So you

must stop looking at people with

such softness.  It is... not Kingly.

The eyes of a King say that all he

cares about is himself, and your

eyes -- how do I tell him this -- ?

You eyes... ask so much.  You

shouldn't care about me, about my --

about...

ATHOS

Oh Raoul, my son... my son...

ATHOS

Come, we have much to do.

Phillippe knows Kingly posture...

how to sit in a chair like a King on his throne, and then

Phillippe trying it, with Athos then playing the roll of a

courtesan paying homage...

of them feeling embarrassed and ridiculous, they laugh.

ARAMIS

Coming?

PORTHOS

What use am I?

ARAMIS

We go someplace dangerous.

PORTHOS

Why didn't you say so?

PORTHOS

It is good to be out on a mission

again... We are out on a mission,

aren't we?

PORTHOS

You're right.  Tell Porthos nothing.

He needs to know nothing, for he is

useless.

ROBBER

Your money or your life.

THIRD ROBBER

Make it quick, old man!

PORTHOS

Old?  Old?!  You're all trying to

rob us because you think we're old?

PORTHOS

Old?!  I'll show you old!!

PORTHOS

Let's see you rob somebody with your

pistol there!

ARAMIS

Come on...

PORTHOS

I have to tell you something.  I

love Paris!

ARAMIS

Here we are.

PORTHOS

Aramis... These are... these are

whores!

ARAMIS

So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord

loved her.

PORTHOS

Did she have tits like that?

PIMP

What do you want?  White?  Black?

Both?

ARAMIS

No.  We want you, Father Belles.

PIMP

Get out!  Now!  I will kill you

where you stand!

ARAMIS

Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

PIMP

Don't!  Get out!

ARAMIS

I have sinned.  And no other

priest's assurance of forgiveness

can mean as much as yours.  Tell me

that I can be forgiven, no matter

what I have done.

PORTHOS

He's going to kill you, Aramis.

ARAMIS

Then let him kill me, if all my

faith is wrong.

ARAMIS

I have come to help you make it

right.  I have come to take you

home.

PRIESTS

Father Belles!

MONK

You have made a miracle!

ARAMIS

God makes miracles.  You make

dinner.

JESUIT

The ball has been rescheduled -- for

tomorrow.

SMASH TO:

ATHOS

These rooms are yours.  Up these

stairs -- or through this hidden

passage -- is the room of your

mistress... Michelle.

PHILLIPPE

Whose rooms are those?

ATHOS

Your mother's.

ARAMIS

Change the horses!  Clear out

everything!  NOW!!

ATHOS

Aramis, this will never --

ARAMIS

Louis is planning a visit to the

Vatican, then who knows where after

that.  If we miss him now we may not

get another chance.

ATHOS

But --

ARAMIS

It presses us but it is good for us

too!  Louis' whims make him more

vulnerable.  We are less ready, but

so are his guards!

PORTHOS

D'Artagnan, unready?

ATHOS

At a ball, everyone watches the

King!

ARAMIS

But what if something extraordinary

happened?  Something so unusual that

all the attention went to someone

else?  Someone whose confirmation of

Phillippe the King would never be

questioned.

PORTHOS

Who?

ARAMIS

The Queen Mother.  Anne.

ANNE

Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

FATHER BELLES

So have I.

ANNE

Father Belles -- ?!

ANNE

They told me you were dead.

FATHER BELLES

I was.  I see you are still a woman

of faith.  I have come back to ask

you if you believe that one lie can

poison your whole life... and one

truth can put it back together

again.

LOUIS

It shall be interesting tonight.

D'ARTAGNAN

Your Majesty.  This ball, with an

open invitation to the nobility of

Paris -- we have no way of

checking --

LOUIS

You will protect me as you always

have, d'Artagnan.

LOUIS

By the way, Claude -- inform

Mademoiselle Beaufort that she will

be moving from her rooms --

LOUIS

Never mind, it seems we have already

told her.

MICHELLE

Murderer!  Murderer!

MICHELLE

I wrote Fromberge!  Under your seal!

I wrote as you, demanding to know

why he disregarded my order to keep

Raoul from danger!  He writes back:

"But your Majesty!  Your last letter

ordered me to put him in front of

the cannon!"

LOUIS

Hysterical woman.

CLAUDE

Sire, misuse of the royal seal -- !

LOUIS

She'll be gone tomorrow.

LOUIS

Mother -- ?

ANNE

May I speak with you?  Alone?

LOUIS

I am preparing for a ball!

ANNE

We haven't visited in three years.

And we should have privacy.

LOUIS

What is it, mother?

ANNE

I wish to discuss your brother.

LOUIS

He is dead!  By God's choice!  There

is nothing to discuss.

ANNE

First they told me he had died at

birth.  Then your father admitted he

was alive, but well cared for, in

secret.  But the message that told

of his death said he had been a

prisoner.

LOUIS

I am King, Mother!  And I do not

wish to discuss this with you.

ANNE

He was my blood -- and I demand to

know what happened to him.

LOUIS

Why would you ask now?  You never

asked before!

ANNE

Because I have dreamed of him.  Not

as the baby they took away, but as a

man.

LOUIS

You have prayed too much.  Your mind

is weak.

ANNE

I believe in dreams, Louis.  They

are our souls speaking to us, from

that world beyond our eyes.  And

that son I never saw in daylight was

standing in the moonlight of my

dreams.  And he wore an iron mask.

LOUIS

It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He

is dead now!  Dead!

ANNE

Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The

night of my dream.

LOUIS

If... if he was wearing an iron mask

in your dream, then how could you

know he was your son?

ANNE

Then you did do it, Louis.  You did

put your brother in an iron mask.

LOUIS

I have a ball to attend!

PHILLIPPE

Whose carriage is this?

PORTHOS

It was mine.  But since you are

about to be the king, it is yours.

ARAMIS

Phillippe first.

ARAMIS

Remember, Phillippe... nobility is

born in the heart.

ATHOS

Hold your goblet with two fingers.

PORTHOS

And make love as if you don't care.

The way Kings do.  And fart whenever

you wish.

ARAMIS

Remember, all you have to do is get

through tonight.  Smile and nod a

lot, and if you get stuck just wave

and announce, "Continue."  In the

morning you hand this note to

d'Artagnan, pardoning Athos and

instructing that he, Aramis and

Porthos be brought to the palace as

your advisors.  And all is well.

ARAMIS

Now the rest of us.

PORTHOS

D'Artagnan watches everything.  We

have to be lucky.

ARAMIS

We will make our own luck tonight...

if Phillippe holds up.

ATHOS

Stay calm, you're doing fine.

PHILLIPPE

My brother...

PHILLIPPE

He knew.  He knew what they did to

me.

YOUNG BEAUTY

What is wrong, your majesty?

LOUIS

Nothing, I -- continue.

LOUIS

There!  Do you see it?

YOUNG BEAUTY

See what, Majesty?

D'ARTAGNAN

Your Majesty...?

LOUIS

... tired.  Must... lie down.

D'ARTAGNAN

Carry on, everyone...

ARAMIS

Quick, to the passages.

D'ARTAGNAN

Your Majesty, is there anything -- ?

PHILLIPPE

The room of the King's favorite

mistress?

ATHOS

She will be at the ball.

ARAMIS

It is Judgment Day.

MUSKETEERS

Your Majesty.

LOUIS

Wh-- Wha--

ARAMIS

Don't look so shocked, Phillippe.

Come, you're going back to prison.

LOUIS

Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --

ARAMIS

D'Artagnan guards the hallway!  You

must go back the way we came!

ATHOS

Now, your Majesty.  It is time.

ATHOS

You know the way.

ATHOS

You have your note?

ATHOS

You have the heart of a king.

PHILLIPPE

Continue.

MICHELLE

My gracious noble lord...

PHILLIPPE

How are you... Michelle?

MICHELLE

How should I be?  I came to give

this back to you.

CLAUDE

Fret not with this, your Majesty --

PHILLIPPE

Stop!  You're hurting her!

PHILLIPPE

However I have wronged you I will

make amends.  Whatever the cost.

PHILLIPPE

Continue.

ATHOS

Don't worry, your Majesty.  We have

a prison for you, where you can rest

peacefully.

D'ARTAGNAN

Michelle --

D'ARTAGNAN

Where is he?

MICHELLE

In... the ballroom.  But he isn't

the same man.

CLAUDE

To King Louis!  And to Anne, the

Queen Mother!

GUESTS

To King Louis, and the Queen Mother!

ANNE

I retire now.  Wait two waltzes,

then retire to your room; and spend

the night in safety.  We have much

to talk about, and have the rest of

our lives to do it.

PHILLIPPE

Good night, Mother.

ANNE

Good night... my son.

D'ARTAGNAN

Anne!  You look --

D'ARTAGNAN

My Queen...

ANNE

D'Artagnan.

D'ARTAGNAN

I have never seen a sight more

beautiful than you, tonight.

ANNE

We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.

D'ARTAGNAN

How long has the King been back?

GUARD

Some while, Captain.

D'ARTAGNAN

He didn't pass my doorway, I was in

my room.

GUARD

He must've, Captain, there is no

other way here.

PHILLIPPE

Continue.

D'ARTAGNAN

Sire, we have an emergency -- of

security.  I must ask you to

accompany me.

PHILLIPPE

... The ball... Continue.

D'ARTAGNAN

I must insist, Sire.

D'ARTAGNAN

My friends.

D'ARTAGNAN

Only we four, the most trusted

Musketeers, knew about the passages,

meant to keep the King safe... Your

Majesty...

PHILLIPPE

Yes...?  Why do you bring me here,

d'Artagnan?

PORTHOS

The King!  Look!  It's the King!

D'ARTAGNAN

Then who is that lying beside you?

PORTHOS

Wh-- ?  Where did he come from?

ATHOS

If you ever loved me -- if you ever

loved honor, or anything else --

then stand now, and let it happen.

D'ARTAGNAN

I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love

you, I cannot.

ARAMIS

This man is an impostor.  We caught

him trying to impersonate the King,

and were just getting rid of him.

LOUIS

D'Artagnan, arrest them all!

ARAMIS

Shut up, knave!

D'ARTAGNAN

Before I came here, I insisted the

King come with me.  The real Louis

would never have let me insist.

ARAMIS

Pull them back, d'Artagnan.

D'ARTAGNAN

You can't do it.

ARAMIS

Pull them back!

D'ARTAGNAN

Everyone back.

ARAMIS

Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into

the boat!  Now!

ARAMIS

Open the gate.

LOUIS

You will not shed royal blood!

LOUIS

I want all these passages sealed!

Another stupid idea of my father's!

Seal them all, every one!

D'ARTAGNAN

It shall be done, your Majesty.

LOUIS

Even the bedchamber passages!  Let

none remain!

D'ARTAGNAN

Yes, your Majesty.

LOUIS

I was told this impostor was dead!

D'ARTAGNAN

... You knew you had a double?

LOUIS

He is my brother.

D'ARTAGNAN

I -- I thought he was but... an

impostor who resembled --

LOUIS

My twin.  Which has kept him alive.

Until now.

ANNE'S VOICE

No!!

ANNE

Louis, please -- !

LOUIS

My guards are useless!  Take her

from me!

LOUIS

What had you to do with this,

Mother?

ANNE

He is your brother!

LOUIS

He is nothing now.

D'ARTAGNAN

Your Majesty... This man before

you... He is royal blood, the same

as you.  To spill it is the one

thing even you cannot do.  It is

against the laws of God, and of

France.

LOUIS

Get out of my way.

D'ARTAGNAN

Not once have I ever asked anything

for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive

this man, this prisoner... your

brother.

LOUIS

Forgive?!

D'ARTAGNAN

Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I

know what they have done was a

threat against you -- and yet that

threat has been removed, with no

harm coming to your Majesty.  If

their passions were in error, their

spirits have ever been noble.

Forgive them.

LOUIS

They have plotted against me!  Me!

The embodiment of God's will!

D'ARTAGNAN

Your Majesty... Every day of your

life, I have watched over you.  No

angel could have stood a more

faithful vigil.  I have bled for

you, and have prayed, every day, to

see you become greater than your

office, better than the law.  Show

me now what my faith and blood have

purchased.  Show mercy.

LOUIS

You take the side of traitors?

PHILLIPPE

Please, may I speak?  M'lord... I

beg that you kill me.  I release

you, before Almighty God, from any

claim of sin in taking my life.  In

fact I will pray that God reward you

for your mercy to do it.  But do not

-- I beg you -- return me to the

prison, where I have lived so long.

LOUIS

D'Artagnan, you will hunt down

Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring

me their heads, or I will have

yours.  And as for you, Phillippe...

Back to the prison you shall go, and

into the mask you hate.

ANNE

No, Louis!  No!

LOUIS

Wear it until you love it.  And die

in it!!

LOUIS

What was that sound?!  Did you hear

it?  It came from Michelle's room!

LOUIS

Where is Michelle?

D'ARTAGNAN

There.

D'ARTAGNAN

There were two.  Not one.  But two.

ANNE

I couldn't tell you.  You had enough

to carry.

D'ARTAGNAN

Anne... The night we had together...

I always wanted more.  But that one,

it was enough.  Enough to make me

love you forever.  I want you to

remember that... and go on.  As

strong as you are now.  No matter

what happens.

ANNE

D'Artagnan -- ?

PHILLIPPE

No.  Please!  No!

BLACKSMITH

Pay me quick, I want out of here.

GUARDS

What --

BASTILLE JAILER

You saw the prisoner's face.

LOUIS

Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?

LIEUTENANT

Out directing the search for the

traitors.

LOUIS

When he returns, watch him.  When he

leaves again, you tell me.

ARAMIS

Bloody hell...

ATHOS

We can't... stay here.  That traitor

d'Artagnan... knows about this

place.

PORTHOS

Can we eat... before we go?  This

excitement's given me an appetite.

ARAMIS

Bread and wine... in that cupboard.

PORTHOS

A note.  Pinned with a dagger, like

the old days.

PORTHOS

"Phillippe has been removed to the

Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At

midnight tonight I will order the

guard changed, and will delay the

replacements for ten minutes.  That

should give you ample time.  Never

have I needed more to say:  One for

all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."

ATHOS

He lures us to capture.

ARAMIS

He seeks redemption.

ATHOS

You're a fool!

ARAMIS

Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am

certain.  What he did tonight was

what he told us all along he would

do -- be faithful to his King.

ATHOS

So what has changed?

ARAMIS

Perhaps he serves a different king.

PORTHOS

What choice is there?  If Phillippe

is in the Bastille, then to the

Bastille we will go.

ATHOS

You are right.  But it is a trap.

PORTHOS

So what?  I'd rather die covered in

blood, than an old man, lying in my

own piss.

ARAMIS

Then to the Bastille.

ATHOS

To the Bastille.  And death.

PORTHOS

Open up!  We have a prisoner!

GUARD

Take him down to level three.  The

Captain will see to the documents.

PORTHOS

It worked!

ATHOS

It's a prison, you idiot!  They

don't expect anyone to try getting

in!  The problem will come when we

want out!

ARAMIS

Midnight!  We have ten minutes!

JAILER

Hey...!

ATHOS

Phillippe...?

PHILLIPPE

How did you --

ARAMIS

(whispering)

Someone's coming!

PORTHOS

D'Artagnan!

D'ARTAGNAN

The way is blocked above.  The

Captain of the Bastille has turned

back from the mission I sent him on,

and is in the courtyard with a party

of men.

ATHOS

He lies.  He is here to trap us.

D'ARTAGNAN

I came to see you safely out.  Check

for yourself.

D'ARTAGNAN

All you have suffered, I would

gladly have borne myself, to keep it

from you.

PORTHOS

D'Artagnan is right, the courtyard

is filling with soldiers!

D'ARTAGNAN

This way.

D'ARTAGNAN

Once you are through, don't stop

until you reach the river.

ARAMIS

They will know you helped us, if we

go this way.

D'ARTAGNAN

That doesn't matter now.

LOUIS

There!  Stop them!

ATHOS

Betrayed!

ARAMIS

Back the way we came!

ARAMIS

Back!

ATHOS

Trapped.

LOUIS

Charge them!

LOUIS

Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!

LIEUTENANT

The corridor nullifies our number...

And no one has stomach to fight the

Captain.

LOUIS

D'Artagnan!

LOUIS' VOICE

I am not angry with you.  I knew you

would lead me to them, and so you

have!  Lay down your sword, and I

will not punish you!  I will let you

retire in peace -- to live out your

days in the countryside!  And I will

give your friends a swift execution,

if you surrender now.

ARAMIS

D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should

accept his offer, for we are dead

anyway.

PORTHOS

He is right, d'Artagnan.

PHILLIPPE

Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all

your lives.  You have done your

best.  Let me go, and let all of you

find peace.

D'ARTAGNAN

No.  Even if I could give up my

friends, I could never give up my

son.

D'ARTAGNAN

I never had any idea you existed...

until they found you.  And in all

that time, I never had a moment's

pride as a father -- until now.

ARAMIS

D'Artagnan... Those are young

Musketeers down there.  They have

been weaned on our legends.  They

revere us -- it is an advantage.

Why don't we charge them?

D'ARTAGNAN

I trained those men myself.  They

will stand and fight.  But if we are

to die, let it be this way.

ATHOS

One for all.  All for one.

PHILLIPPE

If I could have a blade, then I

would be please to run with you.

LIEUTENANT

Magnificent valor...

LOUIS

Shoot them!  Shoot them!

LIEUTENANT

Draw blades!

LIEUTENANT

Stop!

D'ARTAGNAN

NO!

D'ARTAGNAN

Phillippe!

PHILLIPPE

I am unhurt --

PHILLIPPE

You!  Vicious... evil...!

D'ARTAGNAN

Phillippe...!  No... Don't... He is

your brother!

LIEUTENANT

Brother...?

PHILLIPPE

All this time... I was a lost

secret.  But you were hiding all

your loyalty, all your love.  You

were the Man in the Iron Mask.

ATHOS

D'Artagnan...

D'ARTAGNAN

Shhh.  All my life, this is the

death I have wanted.  To die among

you.  One for all... and all for...

LIEUTENANT

All my life, all I ever wanted to

be... was him.

CUT TO:

LIEUTENANT

We have recaptured the prisoner.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

No, no!  I am your --

KING

You will put this madman where no

one can hear his insanity.  Let him

be fed by a deaf mute.  But feed him

well, and let him have a long life

within the Iron Mask.

BASTILLE GOVERNOR

And them?

KING

They are my loyal servants.

MAN IN THE IRON MASK

No!  No...!

DISSOLVE TO:

ARAMIS

Amen.

ATHOS

He was the best of us all.

PHILLIPPE

I will be with you in a moment,

Mother.

PHILLIPPE

After all you have done, I must ask

you one more service to your king.

I have lost my father.  And you have

lost your son.  Let me love you like

a son to a father.  And I pray you

live for this, to love me like your

son.

FADE OUT.
