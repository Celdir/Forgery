Onward Chauncey, to the highest

room of the tallest tower! Where

Prepare foul beast to enter into a

world of pain with which you are

Grrrrrrr!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 4.

PRINCE CHARMING

(HEAVY SOBS)

Oh mommy.

PRINCE CHARMING

Oh, you're right. I can't let this

happen. I can't.

PRINCE CHARMING

I am the rightful King of Far Far

Away and I promise you this mother.

I will restore dignity to my

throne!

PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)

And this time, no one will stand in

my way!

SHREK

Good morning.

FIONA

Good morning.

Oh... morning breath...

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 5.

"Good morning! Good morning!"

DONKEY

"The sun is shining through! Good

morning! Good morning.

(coming closer and closer

TO SHREK)

"To you!"

(TO SHREK)

"And you!"

(TO DRONKEY)

And you!

DONKEY

Oh, they grow up so fast.

SHREK

Not fast enough.

PUSS

Okay. You have a very full day

filling in for the King and Queen.

There are several functions that

require your attendance, sir.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 6.

SHREK

Great! Let's get started.

DONKEY

C'mon, lazy bones, time to get

movin'!

DONKEY

Aaahhh! You know you really need

to get yourself a pair of jammies.

CUT TO:

SHREK

I knight thee...

SHREK

He-he. Ooh.

CUT TO:

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 7.

CUT TO:

DONKEY

Well, since you're filling in for

one, you might as well look like a

real King. Can somebody come in

here and work on Shrek please?

RAUL

(AHEM)

I will see what I can do.

FIONA

Ow!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 8.

DONKEY

Oh!

PUSS

Yeah, wow.

FIONA

Uh, is this really necessary?

RAUL

(TO SHREK)

Ho, ho. Quite necessary, Fiona.

SHREK

I'm Shrek, you twit.

RAUL

Whatever.

PUSS

Okay peoples! This isn't a

rehearsal. Let's see some hustle.

DONKEY

Smiles everyone, smiles!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 9.

SHREK

I don't know how much longer I can

keep this up Fiona.

FIONA

I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please

just try to grin and bear it? It's

just until Dad gets better.

FIONA

Shrek?

SHREK

Yeah.

FIONA

You look handsome.

SHREK

Ah. Come here, you.

SHREK

Oh, my butt is itching up a storm

and I can't reach it in this monkey

suit!

SHREK

Oh.

(WHISTLE)

Hey you. Come here!

SHREK

What's your name?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 10.

FIDDLESWORTH

Eh, Fiddlesworth, sir.

SHREK

Hoo hoo hooo. Perfect.

MASTER OF CEREMONIES

Ladies and gentlemen, Princess

Fiona and Sir Shrek!

SHREK

You've done it. Oh, a little over

to the left, yeah. That's great.

FIONA

Uh Shrek?

SHREK

Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh

yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it!

Oh that's good!

SHREK

Are you okay?

FIONA

Yeah. I'm fine.

FIDDLESWORTH

Ahhhh!

DONKEY

Oh! Shrimp! My favorite.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 12.

CUT TO BLACK:

SHREK

That's it! We're leaving!

FIONA

Honey, please calm down...

SHREK

Calm down? Who do you think we're

kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut

out for this, Fiona and I never

will be.

DONKEY

I think that went pretty well.

SHREK

Donkey!

DONKEY

Aww, come on now Shrek!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 13.

PUSS

Some people just don't understand

boundaries.

FIONA

Just think... a couple more days,

and we'll be back home in our

vermin-filled shack, strewn with

fungus, filled with the rotting

stench of mud and neglect.

SHREK

Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."

FIONA

And, uh... maybe even the pitter-

patter of little feet on the

floor...?

SHREK

(LAUGHS)

That's right. The swamp rats will

be spawning.

FIONA

Uh, no... you know, what I was

thinking of is a little bit bigger

than a swamp rat.

SHREK

Donkey?

FIONA

No, Shrek. Um... what if -

THEORETICALLY -

SHREK

Yeah?

FIONA

They were little ogre feet?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 14.

SHREK

Oh.

(NERVOUS LAUGH)

SHREK

Honey? Let's try and be rational

about this. Have you seen a baby

lately? They just eat and poop and

they cry and then they cry when

they poop and they poop when they

cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby.

They extra cry and they extra poop.

FIONA

Shrek.

FIONA

Don't you ever think about having a

family?

SHREK

Right now, you're my family.

SHREK

Well, somebody better be dying.

CUT TO:

KING HAROLD

I'm dying.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 15.

QUEEN

Harold.

KING HAROLD

Don't forget to pay the gardener,

Lillian.

QUEEN

Of course darling.

KING HAROLD

Fiona...

FIONA

Yes Daddy?

KING HAROLD

I know I've made many mistakes with

you.

FIONA

It's okay.

KING HAROLD

But your love for Shrek has taught

me so much.

KING HAROLD

My dear boy, I am proud to call you

my son.

SHREK

And I'm proud to call you my

Frog... King Dad in-law.

KING HAROLD

Now, there is a matter of business

to attend tooo...

PUSS

The Frog King is dead.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 16.

DONKEY

(TO PUSS)

Put your hat back on, fool.

KING HAROLD

Shrek, please come hither.

SHREK

Yeah, Dad?

KING HAROLD

This Kingdom needs a new king. You

and Fiona are next in line for the

throne.

SHREK

Ooo. Next in line. Now you see

Dad, that's why people love you.

Even on your deathbed you're still

making jokes.

SHREK

Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King?

I don't think that's such a good

idea. There's got to be somebody

else. Anybody?

KING HAROLD

Aside from you there is only one

remaining heir.

SHREK

Really!? Who is he, Dad?

KING HAROLD

His name is... is... is...

SHREK

What's his name? What's his name?

KING HAROLD

...is ...

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 17.

FIONA

Daddy!

KING HAROLD

(chewing the fly)

His name is Arthur.

SHREK

Arthur?

KING HAROLD

(COUGH)

I know you'll do what's...

(EXHALING)

riiiight...

QUEEN

Harold!?

SHREK

Dad? Dad? Dad?

DONKEY

Do your thing, man.

PRINCE CHARMING

What does a Prince have to do to

get a drink around here?

PRINCE CHARMING

Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly

stepsister I'll never know.

PRINCE CHARMING

Where's Doris, taking the night

off?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 20.

MABEL

She's not welcome here and neither

are you.

MABEL (CONT'D)

What do you want, Charming?

PRINCE CHARMING

Oh not much, just a chance at

redemption...

(LAUGHS)

And a Fuzzy Navel.

PRINCE CHARMING

And Fuzzy Navels for all my

friends!

CAPTAIN HOOK

We're not your friends.

PRINCE CHARMING

Ahh!

CAPTAIN HOOK

You don't belong here.

PRINCE CHARMING

You're right; oh, I mean you're

absolutely right, but I mean, do

any of us?

CYCLOPS

Do a number on his face!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 21.

PRINCE CHARMING

No, no, wait, wait, wait! We are

more alike than you think.

PRINCE CHARMING

Wicked Witch. The Seven Dwarves

saved Snow White and then what

happened?

EVIL QUEEN

Oh, what's it to you?

PRINCE CHARMING

They left you the un-fairest of

them all. And now here you are,

hustling pool to get your next

meal. How does that feel?

EVIL QUEEN

Pretty unfair.

PRINCE CHARMING

And you? Your star puppet abandons

the show to go and find his father.

PUPPET MASTER

I hate that little wooden puppet.

PRINCE CHARMING

And Hook...

PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)

... Need I say more?

PRINCE CHARMING

And you! Frumpypigskin.

RUMPLESTILTSKIN

Rumplestiltskin.

PRINCE CHARMING

Where's that first-born you were

promised, hey?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 22.

PRINCE CHARMING

Mabel, remember how you couldn't

get your little fat foot into that

tiny glass slipper?

PRINCE CHARMING

Cinderella is in Far Far Away right

now, eating Bon Bons, cavorting

with every little last Fairy-tale

Creature that has ever done you

wrong.

PRINCE CHARMING

Once upon a time, someone decided

that we were the losers. But there

are two sides to every story. And

our side has not been told.

PRINCE CHARMING

So who will join me? Who wants to

come out on top for once? Who

wants their happily ever after?!

CUT TO:

BLIND MOUSE #1

This way gents.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 23.

PUSS

It's out of my hands senorita, the

winds of fate have blown on my

destiny. But I will never forget

you. You are the love of my life.

PUSS (CONT'D)

As are you...

PUSS (CONT'D)

And you.

PUSS (CONT'D)

And, uh... hi. I don't know you,

but I'd like to. I gotta go.

DONKEY

I know, I know... I don't want to

leave you either baby, but you know

how Shrek is. The dude's lost

without me.

DONKEY

But don't worry. I'll send you

airmail kisses everyday!

DONKEY

Alright, be strong babies! Be

strong. Now, Coco, Peanut, you

listen to Mama, alright? And

Bananas, no more roastin'

marshmallows on your sister's head.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 24.

DONKEY

Ah, that's my special boy. Oh,

come over here, all of you. Give

your Daddy a big hug!

FIONA

Shrek, maybe you should just stay

and be King.

SHREK

Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could

ever run a kingdom. That's why your

cousin Arthur's the perfect choice.

FIONA

It's not that. No. It's, you

see...

SHREK (CONT'D)

And if he gives me any trouble,

I've always got persuasion and

reason.

(holds up his right fist)

Here's persuasion,

(holds up his left fist)

and here's reason.

SHREK

Fiona, soon it's just gonna be you

and me and our swamp.

FIONA

(HESITANT)

It's not going to be just you and

me.

SHIP CAPTAIN

All aboard!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 25.

SHREK

It will be. I promise. I love

you.

FAIRYTALE CREATURES

Awwwwwwwww!

PIG #1

That's lovely.

DONKEY

Bye bye babies!

FIONA

Shrek!

SHREK

Yeah?

FIONA

Wait!

SHREK

What is it?

FIONA

I'm, I'm-

SHREK

I love you too honey!

FIONA

No... No, I said I'm pr-

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 26.

SHREK

You're what?!

FIONA

I said I'm pregnant!

SHREK

(doesn't want to believe

HIS EARS)

Uh... what was that?

FIONA

You're going to be a father!

SHREK

(NERVOUS LAUGH)

That's great.

FIONA

Really? I'm glad you think so! I

love you.

SHREK

Yeah...

(NERVOUS LAUGH)

Me too... you...

DONKEY

I'm gonna be an Uncle. I'm gonna

be an Uncle! I'm gonna be an

Uncle!

PUSS

Oh, and you my friend are royally--

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 27.

SHREK

Ahhh. Home.

SHREK

SHREK

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 28.

SHREK

Huh? Oh no.

It's okay. It's gonna be alright.

OGRE BABY

DONKEY

(with ogre baby head)

Da-da!

SHREK

Ahhhh!

DONKEY

Shrek. Shrek, are you okay?

SHREK

Oh... I can't believe I'm going to

be a father.

SHREK

How did this happen?

PUSS

Allow me to explain. You see, when

a man has certain feelings for a

woman, a powerful urge sweeps over

him...

SHREK

I know how it happened. I just

can't believe it.

DONKEY

How does it happen?

CUT TO:

DONKEY

And the cat's in the cradle and the

silver spoon,

DONKEY (CONT'D)

"When you coming home, son?" "I

don't know when,

But we'll get together then, Dad-"

SHREK

Donkey, can you just cut to the

part where you're supposed to make

me feel better?

PUSS

You know I love Fiona, Boss.

Right?

(CONFIDENTIALLY)

But what I'm talking about here is

you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice-

cold pitcher of mojitos, and two

weeks of nothing but fishing.

DONKEY

Man, don't you listen to him.

Having a baby is not going to ruin

your life.

SHREK

It's not my life I'm worried about

ruining. It's the kid's.

SHREK

I mean...when have you ever heard

the phrase "as sweet as an...ogre"

or "as nurturing as...an ogre" Or

how `bout..."you're gonna' love my

dad...he's a real ogre."

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 32.

DONKEY

Okay, okay I get it! Nobody said

it was going to be easy. But at

least you got us to help you out.

SHREK

That's true.

SHREK

I'm doomed.

DONKEY

You'll be fine.

SHIP CAPTAIN

You're finished.

SHIP CAPTAIN

Uh, with your journey.

CUT TO:

DONKEY

Wor-ces-ter-shireee. Now that

sounds fancy.

SHREK

It's Worcestershire.

DONKEY

Like the sauce!? Mmmm... It's

spicy!

DONKEY

Oohh! They must be expecting us.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 33.

DONKEY

What in the shista-shire kind of

place is this?

SHREK

Well, my stomach aches and my palms

just got sweaty. Must be a high

school.

DONKEY

High school?!

CHEERLEADERS

Ready?! Okay! Where for art thou

headed, to the top? Yeah we think

so, we think so! And dost thou

thinkest thine can be stopped? Nay

we thinks not! We thinks not!

FEMALE STUDENT #1

Ahhhhh!

DRIVERS ED INSTRUCTOR

All right Mr. Percival, just ease

up on the reigns-

VAN STUDENT

(cough, cough)

For lo bro, don't burn all my

frankincense and myrrh.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 34.

DONKEY

I'm already starting to feel

nauseous from memories of wedgies

and swirlies!

PUSS

But how did you receive the wedgies

when you are clearly not the wearer

of the underpants?

DONKEY

Let's just say some things are

better left unsaid and leave it at

that.

GUINEVERRE

So then I was all like "I'd rather

get the black plague and lock

myself in an iron maiden than go

out with you."

TIFFANY

Eh, totally.

SHREK

Pardon me...

GUINEVERRE

Eh! Totally ew-th!

TIFFANY

Yeah, totally!

GARY

Yes! I just altered my character

level to plus three superbability.

SHREK

Hi, we're looking for someone named-

GARY

Gee, who rolled a plus nine "dork"

spell and summoned the beast and

his quadrupeds.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 35.

XAVIER

Ha! Ha!

(SNORT)

Ah!

SHREK

I know you're busy "not fitting in"

but can either of you tell me where

I can find Arthur?

GARY

He's over there.

CUT TO:

KNIGHT (LANCELOT)

Ha ha! There is no sweeter taste

on thy tongue than victory!

JOCKS

Oy! Right! Ooo! Ooo! Ooo!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 36.

SHREK

Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

Does Arthur look like a King or

what?

TEENAGER (ARTIE)

Ow.

SHREK

Oh. Sorry.

TEENAGER (ARTIE)

Did you just say you were looking

for Arthur?

PUSS

That information is on a need to

know basis.

DONKEY

It's top secret, hushity hush.

CUT TO:

KNIGHT (LANCELOT)

Now gentlemen let's away... to the

showers!

JOCKS

Oy! Right! Ooo! Ooo!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 37.

SHREK (CONT'D)

Greetings your majesty. This is

your lucky day.

KNIGHT (LANCELOT)

So what for like are you supposed

to be? Some kind of giant mutant

leprechaun or something?

SHREK

Oh, ho, ho, ho. Giant mutant

leprechaun... You made a funny.

KNIGHT (LANCELOT)

Unhand me, monster!

SHREK

Stop squirming, Arthur.

KNIGHT (LANCELOT)

I'm not Arthur!

LANCELOT

I am Lancelot.

LANCELOT

That dork over there is Arthur!

SHREK

Hey!

LANCELOT

Aaah.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 38.

GUINEVERRE

Ahem! This is like totally

embarrassing, but my friend Tiffany

thinkest thou vex her so soothly...

GUINEVERRE

And she thought perchance thou

would wanna ask her to the

Homecoming Dance or something...

SHREK

Uh, excuse me?

GUINEVERRE

It's like whatever. She's just

totally into college guys and

mythical creatures and stuff.

CUT TO:

SHREK

Oh Arthur! Come out, come out

wherever you are...

DONKEY

Yeah, you better run, you little

punk no good-niks, `cause the days

of "Little Donkey Dumpy Drawers"

are over!

HALL MONITOR

Hold it...

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 39.

COSTUME STUDENT 1

We're here for the Mascot Contest.

COSTUME STUDENT 2

Grrrrr!

SHREK

(pleased with himself)

We're here for the Mascot Contest

too.

HALL MONITOR

(SUSPICIOUS)

This is a costume?

SHREK

(RECOVERING)

Aaaiyyyy... worked on it all night

long!

HALL MONITOR

Looks pretty real to me.

PUSS

If it were real could I do this?

DONKEY

Or this?

SHREK

(UNBELIEVABLY STRAINED)

He's right! If it were real that

would have been agonizingly

painful!

DONKEY

Now watch this....

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 40.

SHREK

(INTERRUPTING; THROUGH

GRITTED TEETH)

That's quite enough boys.

PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY

Thank you to Professor Primbottom

for his invigorating lecture on how

to just say "nay".

PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY

And now, without further ado, let's

give a warm Worcestershire-hoozah

to the winner of our "New Mascot"

contest... the--

PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY (CONT'D)

--ogre?

SHREK

That's right. I'm the new mascot.

So let's really try and beat the

other guys... at whatever it is

they're doing.

PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY

This is indeed all a bit

unorthodox.

SHREK

Now, where can I find Arthur

Pendragon?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 41.

LANCELOT

Classic.

DONKEY

You should be ashamed of yourself.

LANCELOT

I didn't do it. They did.

ARTIE

Please don't eat me.

STUDENTS

(CHANTING)

Eat him! Eat him!

PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY

Eat him!

SHREK

I'm not here to eat him.

STUDENTS

AWWW.

SHREK

It's time to pack up your

toothbrush and jammies. You're the

new King of Far Far Away.

ARTIE

What?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 42.

LANCELOT

Artie a King? More like the Mayor

of Loserville.

BOHORT

Nice one Lance!

LANCELOT

Burn.

ARTIE

Is this for real?

SHREK

Absolutely. Now clean out your

locker, kid. You've got a kingdom

to run.

ARTIE

So wait, I'm really the only heir?

SHREK

The one and only.

ARTIE

Give me just a second.

ARTIE

My good people, I think there's a

lesson here for all of us. Maybe

the next time you're about to dunk

a kid's head in a chamber pot,

you'll stop and think, hey, maybe

this guy has feelings. Maybe I

should cut him some slack. Because

maybe, just maybe... this guy's

gonna turn out to be, uh...I

dunno...a King! And maybe his

first royal decree will be to

banish everyone who ever picked on

him -- that's right, I'm looking at

you, jousting team.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 43.

ARTIE

And Gwen... oh Gwen. I've always

loved you.

GUINEVERRE

Ew.

ARTIE

Well good friends, it breaks my

heart, but, enjoy your stay here in

prison while I rule the free world

baby!

SHREK

Alright, let's not overdo it.

ARTIE

I'm building my city people! On

Rock and Roll!

SHREK

You just overdid it.

ARTIE

Ow!

Do you smell ham?

SNOW WHITE

Oooh! It's present time!

CINDERELLA

Oh, Fiona, won't you please open

(LAUGHS)

"Hopefully this helps. Love,

Cinderella."

PRINCESSES

Oooo! Aaaah!

DORIS

Will you look at that!

SLEEPING BEAUTY

What is it?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 45.

CINDERELLA

It's for the poopies.

FIONA

Oh, you guys, that's so sweet.

"Have one on me, love Snow White"

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 46.

FIONA

(CONFUSED)

Umm... what is it?

SNOW WHITE

Ha, haaa! He's a live-in baby-

sitter.

NANNY DWARF

Where's the baby?

FIONA

You're too kind, Snow, but I can't

accept this.

SNOW WHITE

Think nothing of it. I've got six

more at home.

FIONA

What does he do?

CINDERELLA

The cleaning.

SNOW WHITE

The feeding.

NANNY DWARF

The burping.

FIONA

So what are Shrek and I supposed to

do?

RAPUNZEL

Well, now you'll have plenty of

time to work on your marriage.

FIONA

Gee thanks Rapunzel, and what's

that supposed to mean?

RAPUNZEL

Oh, come on now, Fiona. You know

what happens.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 47.

SLEEPING BEAUTY

(WAKING)

Huh? You're tired all the time...

RAPUNZEL

Say goodbye to romance.

DRAGON

Yort.

FIONA

Um sorry... but how many of you

have kids?

DORIS

She's right. A baby is only gonna

strengthen the love that Shrek and

Fiona have. How did Shrek react

when you told him? Tell me!

FIONA

Well, when he first found

out...Shrek said-

Name doesn't ring a bell.

PIG #1

Yah!

PIG #2

No bell!

PRINCE CHARMING

I suggest you freaks cooperate with

the new King of Far Far Away.

GINGERBREAD MAN

The only thing you're ever gonna be

King of is "King of the Stupids."

(SINGING)

"On the Good Ship Lollypop,

It's a sweet trip,

To the candy shop,

Where the Bon Bons play,

On the sunny beach of Peppermint

Bay.."

PRINCE CHARMING

You! You can't lie. So tell me

puppet... Where is Shrek?!

PINOCCHIO

(NERVOUS)

Well, I don't know where he's not.

PRINCE CHARMING

You're telling me you don't know

where Shrek is?

PINOCCHIO

It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume

that I couldn't exactly not say

that is or isn't almost partially

incorrect.

PRINCE CHARMING

So you do know where he is!

PINOCCHIO

On the contrary, I'm possibly more

or less, not definitely rejecting

the idea, that in no way, with any

amount of uncertainty that...

PRINCE CHARMING

Stop it.

PINOCCHIO (CONT'D)

...I undeniably do or do not know

where he shouldn't probably be.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 54.

PINOCCHIO

If that indeed wasn't where he

isn't. Even if he wasn't not where

I knew he was could mean that I

wouldn't completely not know where

he wasn't.

PIG #1

Oh, enough! Shrek went off to

bring back the next heir! Oh!

PRINCE CHARMING

He's bringing back the next heir?

PINOCCHIO

No!

PRINCE CHARMING

Hook! Get rid of this new "King."

CAPTAIN HOOK

Right!

PRINCE CHARMING

But bring Shrek to me. I have

something special in mind for him.

PINOCCHIO

He'll never fall for your tricks!

WOLF

Oh boy.

CUT TO:

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 55.

ARTIE

I can't believe it... me a King?

I...I mean I knew I came from

royalty and all, but I just figured

everyone forgot about me.

SHREK

Oh no, in fact, the King asked for

you personally.

ARTIE

Really? Wow! Look, I know it's not

all gonna be fun and games.

SHREK

It really is all fun and games,

actually. Sure, you have to knight

a few heroes, launch a ship or two.

By the way, make sure you hit the

boat just right with the bottle.

ARTIE

Boat with the bottle? Any idiot

can hit a boat with a bottle.

SHREK

Well, I've heard it's harder than

it looks.

ARTIE

Whoa!! This is gonna be huge.

Parties, princesses, castles...

princesses.

DONKEY

It's gonna be great, Artie. You'll

be living in the lap of luxury.

They got the finest chefs around

waiting for you to place your

order.

PUSS

And fortunately you'll have the

royal food tasters.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 56.

ARTIE

(INTRIGUED))

Oh yeah? What do they do?

PUSS

They taste the food before the King

eats, to make sure it's not

poisoned.

ARTIE

Poisoned?

SHREK

Or too salty!

DONKEY

(TO ARTIE)

Don't worry about it. You'll be

safe and sound with the help of

your body guards.

ARTIE

Body guards?

PUSS

All of them, willing at a moment's

notice to lay down their own lives

out of devotion to you.

ARTIE

Really?

PUSS

Si, and the whole kingdom will look

to you for wisdom and guidance.

DONKEY

Just make sure they don't die of

famine.

PUSS

Or plague.

DONKEY

Oh, plague is bad.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 57.

PUSS

The coughing, the groaning, the

festering sores.

SHREK

Oh! Festering sores! Hey, you are

one funny kitty cat.

PUSS

What did I say?

SHREK

We don't want Artie here getting

the wrong idea.

SHREK (CONT'D)

Uh, Artie?

ALL

Whoa!

SHIP CAPTAIN

Whoa! Oh, there goes my hip.

SHREK

Artie!

SHREK (CONT'D)

What are you doing?!

ARTIE

What does it look like?!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 58.

SHREK

This really isn't up to you!

ARTIE

But I don't know anything about

being King!

SHREK

You'll learn on the job!

DONKEY

Whoaaa!

ARTIE

Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm

going back!

SHREK

Back to what? Being a loser?!

SHREK (CONT'D)

Now look what you did!

ARTIE

Look what I did? Who's holding the

wheel chief?

DONKEY

(SWALLOWING; THEN

SHOUTING)

Shrek!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 59.

SHIP CAPTAIN (O.S.)

Land ho!

PUSS

How humiliating...

SHREK

Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

ARTIE

Oh, so now it's "Your highness?"

What happened to "loser?" Huh?

SHREK

Hey, if you think this is getting

you out of anything, well it isn't.

We're heading back to Far Far Away

one way or another, and you're

gonna be a father!

ARTIE

What?

DONKEY

(clearing his throat)

A-hem. You just said father...

SHREK

You're... I said king. You're

gonna be King!

ARTIE

(IMITATING SHREK)

"You're gonna be King!" Yeah

right.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 60.

SHREK

Where do you think you're going?

ARTIE

Far Far Away... from you!

SHREK

You get back here young man and I

mean it!

PUSS

Uh boss, I don't think he's coming

back and maybe it's for the best.

He is not exactly king material.

DONKEY

When were you planning on telling

him that you were really supposed

to be King?

SHREK

Oh c'mon, now why would I do that?

Besides, he'll be ten times better

at it than me.

DONKEY

Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then

you're gonna have to change your

tactics if you want to get anywhere

with this kid.

SHREK

You're right, Donkey.

SHREK

What about this?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 61.

DONKEY

Shrek!

SHREK

Oh c'mon. It's just a joke.

(LAUGHS)

Still...

SHREK

Listen Artie...

SHREK (CONT'D)

If you think this whole mad scene

ain't dope, I feel you dude. I

mean, I'm not trying to get up in

your grill or raise your roof or

whatever, but what I am screaming

is, yo, check out this kazing

thazing bazaby.

SHREK

I mean, if it doesn't groove or

what I'm saying ain't straight

trippin', just say, oh no you

didn't, you know, you're gettin' on

my last nerve. And then I'll know

it's... then I'll know it's whack--

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 62.

ARTIE

SOMEBODY HELP! I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED

BY A MONSTER TRYING TO RELATE TO

ME!

SHREK

Artie! Wait!

ARTIE

C'mon! C'mon! Help! Help!

Hello?

DONKEY

AHHHH!

WIZARD HEAD (MERLIN)

Greetings cosmic children of the

universe, and welcome to my

serenity circle!

WIZARD HEAD (MERLIN)

Please leave any bad vibes outside

the healing vortex. And now

prepare ...

MERLIN

I knew I should of gotten that

warranty!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 63.

MERLIN

AHH! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

ARTIE

Mr. Merlin?

SHREK

You know this guy?

ARTIE

Yeah. He was the school's magic

teacher until he had his nervous

breakdown.

MERLIN

Uh, technically I was merely a

victim of a level three fatigue,

and at the request of my therapist

and the school authorities, I have

retired to the tranquility of

nature to discover my divine

purpose.

MERLIN

Now, can I interest anyone in a

snack or beverage?

SHREK

Uh, no.

MERLIN

Sure you don't wanna try my famous

rock au-gratin?

MERLIN

It's organic!

SHREK

Oh, thanks, I just ate a boulder on

the way in. What we need are

directions back to Far Far Away.

ARTIE

What's with the "we"? Who said I

was going with you?

SHREK

Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of

people counting on you so don't try

and weasel out of it.

ARTIE

If it's such a great job, why don't

you do it?

SHREK

Understand this kid, it's no more

Mr. Nice Guy from here on out!

ARTIE

Oh, so that was your "Mr. Nice

Guy?"

SHREK

I know, and I'm gonna miss him.

ARTIE

You know what? Why don't you go

terrorize a village and leave me

alone?

SHREK

Oh, is that some kind of crack

about ogres? You get your royal

highness to Far Far Away before I

kick it there.

(TO MERLIN)

Now which way am I kicking?

MERLIN

Oh, I could tell you. But since

you're in the midst of self-

destructive rage spiral it would be

karmic-ly irresponsible.

SHREK

Self-destructive ra...

(TO MERLIN)

Look, are you gonna help us or not?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 65.

MERLIN

Most definitely, but only after you

take the journey to your soul.

SHREK

Yeah, I don't think so.

MERLIN

Look pal, it's either that or some

primal scream therapy.

Ahhhhhhhhhh!

SHREK

Alright, alright... journey to the

soul...

CUT TO:

MERLIN

Now all of you, look into the "Fire

of Truth" and tell me what you see!

Yah! Ha!

(Wild war cry)

Woo-looo-looo-looo!

DONKEY

Ooo! Charades! Okay, I see a

dutch fudge torte with cinnamon

swirls.

MERLIN

Okay. Monster, go for it.

SHREK

I see a rainbow pony.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 66.

MERLIN

Excellent work!

(THEN)

Now! The boy!

ARTIE

This is lame.

ARTIE

Ow!

MERLIN

You're lame! Now just go for it.

ARTIE

Okay. There's a baby bird and a

father bird sitting in a nest.

MERLIN

Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!

ARTIE

Wait, the dad just flew away. Why

did he leave the little bird all

alone?

ARTIE

It's trying to fly, but it doesn't

know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!

MERLIN

Whew, proper head case you are,

aren't you? Really messed up.

Whoa.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 67.

ARTIE

Yeah, yeah, okay. I get it. The

bird's me. My dad left. So what?

SHREK

(CLEARS THROAT)

Look Artie...um-

MERLIN

(loud, over the music)

Just thought I might help set the

mood! Y'know for your big heart to

heart chat!

SHREK

I know what it's like to not feel

ready for something.

SHREK

Even ogres get scared...you know,

once in a while.

ARTIE

I know you want me to be king, but

I can't. I'm not cut out for it and

I never will be, alright?

ARTIE (CONT'D)

Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth

the trouble. He dumped me at that

school the first chance he got and

I never heard from him again.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 68.

SHREK

My dad wasn't really the fatherly

type either.

ARTIE

Well, I doubt he was worse than

mine.

SHREK

Oh yeah? My father was an ogre.

He tried to eat me.

SHREK

Now, I guess I should have seen it

coming. He used to give me a bath

in barbecue sauce and put me to bed

with an apple in my mouth.

ARTIE

Okay... I guess that's... pretty

bad.

SHREK

You know, it may be hard to believe

what with my obvious charm and good

looks, but people used to think

that I was a monster. And for a

long time, I believed them.

SHREK (CONT'D)

But after awhile, you learn to

ignore the names that people call

you and you just trust who you are.

ARTIE

You know, you're okay, Shrek.

ARTIE

You just need to do a little less

yelling and use a little more soap.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 69.

SHREK

Thanks Artie.

ARTIE

The soap's because you stink.

Really bad.

SHREK

Yeah. I got that.

CUT TO:

CINDERELLA

Oh this place is filthy. I feel

like a hobo.

SNOW WHITE

I'm sorry but this just isn't

working for me.

SLEEPING BEAUTY

Everything's always about you,

isn't it? It's not like your

attitude is helping, Snow.

SNOW WHITE

Well maybe it just bothers you that

I was voted fairest in the land.

RAPUNZEL

You mean in that rigged election?

SNOW WHITE

Oh, give me a break.

QUEEN

Ladies, let go of your petty

complaints and let's work together.

SNOW WHITE

So I guess the plan is we just

wander aimlessly in this stink hole

until we rot.

FIONA

No, we're gonna get inside and find

out what Charming's up to.

DORIS

I know he's a jerk and everything,

but I gotta admit, that Charming

makes me hotter than July.

SLEEPING BEAUTY

Ew!

RAPUNZEL

Ugh.

FIONA

That's it!

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 71.

RAPUNZEL

Come on, this way!

FIONA

Rapunzel. Wait!

FIONA

Charming, let go of her.

PRINCE CHARMING

But why would I want to do that?

RAPUNZEL

Grrrr!

PRINCE CHARMING

Woof!

FIONA

What?

PRINCE CHARMING

Say hello ladies, to the new Queen

of Far Far Away.

CINDERELLA

Yaaaaaaaaay!

FIONA

Rapunzel, how could you?

RAPUNZEL

Jealous much?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 72.

PRINCE CHARMING

Soon you'll be back where you

started... scrubbing floors or

locked away in towers; that is, if

I let you last the week.

RAPUNZEL

But Pooky, you promised you

wouldn't hurt them!

PRINCE CHARMING

Not here, "kitten whiskers." Daddy

will discuss it later. Now forgive

us, we have a show to put on.

FIONA

Shrek will be back soon Charming,

and you'll be sorry.

PRINCE CHARMING

Sorry? Don't you realize --once

Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away

he's doomed?

CAPTAIN HOOK

Ya cowards!

SHREK

What has Charming done with Fiona?

CAPTAIN HOOK

She's gonna get what's coming to

her.

CAPTAIN HOOK

Ahhh.

(YELLING BACK)

And there ain't nothing you can do

to stop him!

PUSS

We've got to save her!

DONKEY

But she's so far far away!

SHREK

Get yourself back to

Worcestershire, kid.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 76.

ARTIE

No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've

got an idea.

MERLIN

(CHANTING)

I'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz,

buzz...

ARTIE

Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to

get them...I mean, us, back to Far

Far Away.

MERLIN

(GETTING UP)

Forget it. I don't have that kind

of magic in me anymore, kid. How

about a hug instead? Hmm? That's

the best kind of magic.

ARTIE

Mr. Merlin please. I know you can

DO IT-

MERLIN

I said, forget it!

ARTIE

BUT-

MERLIN (CONT'D)

Mumble, grumble, interrupt my

healing. Mumble, mumble.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 77.

MERLIN

Oh. What, what's with you?

ARTIE

It's just so hard. You know? They

really need to get back `cause

their kingdom's in trouble `cause

there's a really bad man and it's

just so hard...

MERLIN

C'mon, take it easy.

ARTIE

No! I don't think you understand!

There's a mean person doing mean

things to good people-

SHREK

Oh, have a heart old man!

ARTIE

And they really need your help to

get them back! So why won't you

help them?

MERLIN

Oh.

MERLIN

Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my

things.

ARTIE

Piece of cake.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 78.

SHREK

Well, well, well. You want some

eggs with that ham?

MERLIN

Now, I am a little rusty, so there

could be some side effects.

DONKEY

Side effects!?

MERLIN

Don't worry, whatever it is, no

matter how excruciatingly painful

it may be, it'll wear off

eventually... I think.

DONKEY

Ah!

MERLIN

Oops.

DONKEY

Are you sure this is a good idea?

SHREK

Look, if Artie trusts him, that's

good enough for me. Even if his

robe doesn't quite cover his-

MERLIN

Alacraticious expeditious, a zoomy

zoom zoom. Let's help our friends

get back, um... soon!

Woah! It worked!

I've been abracadabra'd into a

At least you don't look like some

You really should think about going

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 80.

DONKEY

(in Puss' body)

Yeah, and you should think about

getting yourself a pair of pants!

I feel all exposed and nasty.

DONKEY

Oh, so you two think this is funny?

ARTIE

(SNICKERS)

I'm really sorry guys.

SHREK

Don't be! You got us back kid.

Yeah, the breakfast croissants

Don't worry. She and the others

It's Artie, actually.

PRINCE CHARMING

This boy is supposed to be the new

King of Far Far Away?

How pathetic! Now, stand still so I

won't make a mess.

SHREK

Charming, stop! I'm here now, you

got what you wanted. This isn't

about him.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 89.

ARTIE

Then who's it about? I'm supposed

to be King, right?

SHREK

You weren't really next in line for

the throne, okay? I was.

ARTIE

But you said the King asked for me

personally.

SHREK

Not exactly.

ARTIE

What's that supposed to mean?

SHREK

Look, I said whatever I had to say,

alright! I wasn't right for the

job, I just needed some fool to

So just go!

ARTIE

You were playing me the whole time.

SHREK

You catch on real fast kid... Maybe

you're not as big of a loser as I

thought.

ARTIE

You know, for a minute there, I

actually thought you -

PRINCE CHARMING

What? That he cared about you? He's

an ogre. What did you expect?

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 90.

PRINCE CHARMING

You really do have a way with

children, Shrek.

Had we just stayed put like I

suggested, we could be sipping tea

out of little heart-shaped cups...

Eating crumpets smothered with

BUT YOU'RE-

DONKEY

I know, I know. Everything's a

now. But what happened is, we went

to high school, the boat crashed,

and we got "bippity-bopity-booped"

by the "Magic Man."

DORIS

You poor sweet things.

CINDERELLA

I don't get it.

SNOW WHITE

The cat turned into a little horse

that smells like feet. What's to

get?

SLEEPING BEAUTY

Huh? Who dat?

FIONA

Where's Shrek?

Alright everyone, we need to find a

way out, now.

SNOW WHITE

You're right.

(to the other Princesses)

Ladies, assume the position!

FIONA

What are you doing?

SLEEPING BEAUTY

Waiting to be rescued.

FIONA

You have got to be kidding me.

SNOW WHITE

Well, what do you expect us to do?

We're just four...

princesses, two circus freaks, a

pregnant ogre and an old lady.

Hmmm. Excuse me. Old lady coming

Well, you didn't actually think you

got your fighting skills from your

father, did you?

SNOW WHITE

Excuse me, I think there's still

one more.

QUEEN

Hmmmm.

QUEEN

Hiiiiyah!

FIONA

Why don't you just lie down?

FIONA

Okay girls, from here on out, we're
