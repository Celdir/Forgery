LLOYD

Excuse me, can you tell me how to

get to the medical school? I'm

supposed to be giving a lecture in

twenty minutes and my driver's a bit

lost.

YOUNG WOMAN

(heavy European accent)

Go straight aheads and makes a left

over za bridge.

LLOYD

I couldn't help noticing the accent.

You from Jersey?

YOUNG WOMAN

(unimpressed)

Austria.

LLOYD

Austria? You're kidding.

(mock-Australian accent)

Well, g'day, mate. What do you say

we get together later and throw a

few shrimp on the barbie.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

(to self)

Guess I won't be going Down Under

tonight...

2.

DISPATCHER

(v.o.)

Carr 22, come in, car 22...

LLOYD

This is 22.

DISPATCHER

22, where the hell are you, Lloyd?

You're running late on the East Side

pick-up.

LLOYD

Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my

way.

DISPATCHER

(v.o.)

Well hurry it up. And make sure you

park legally. One more ticket and

your ass is history.

CUT TO:

HARRY

Okay, gang, single file. You know

the rules: No pushing, no humping,

and no sniffing heinies...

3.

PALMER

Hey, why aren't those mutts on

leashes?

HARRY

The same reason you're not on a leash,

sir because it's demeaning and it

chafes like hell.

PALMER

Just get them in here now! They all

have to be bathed and clipped in an

hour.

HARRY

You kids stay right here...

HARRY (CONT'D)

(at truck)

Hey, wait a minute!

CUT TO:

MARY

Hello.

(beat)

I'll be just a minute...

4.

CUT TO:

LLOYD

Why you going to the airport? Flying

somewhere?

MARY

(dead-pan)

How'd you guess?

LLOYD

Well, I saw your luggage, then when

I noticed the airline ticket, I put

two and two together.

(beat)

So where you heading?

MARY

Aspen.

LLOYD

Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear

California's beautiful this time of

year.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.

MARY

I'm Mary.

LLOYD

Uh, this isn't my real job, you know.

It's only temporary.

5.

MARY

Oh?

LLOYD

Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I

are saving up our money so we can

open our own pet store.

MARY

That's nice.

LLOYD

(smiling)

I got worms.

MARY

I beg your pardon?

LLOYD

That's what we're gonna call it: I

Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in

selling worm farms you know, like

ant farms. A lot of people don't

realize that worms make much better

pets than ants. They're quiet,

affectionate, they don't bite, and

they're super with the kids.

MARY

Aren't ants quiet, too?

LLOYD

Uh... well, sure but they aren't half

as affectionate. And if you cut an

ant's head off, it won't grow back.

MARY

I see.

LLOYD

And best of all, worm farming is a

seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year

industry. I wouldn't mind having a

piece of that pie, if you know what

I mean.

6.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

What's the matter? Little tense about

the flight?

MARY

(beat)

Something like that.

LLOYD

It's really nothing to worry about,

Mary. Statistically, they say you're

more likely to get killed on the way

to the airport. You know, like in a

head-on crash, or something.

MARY

Um, Lloyd, could please keep your

eyes on the road.

LLOYD

Good thinking. There's a lot of bad

rivers out there.

CUT TO:

MARY

Here you go.

LLOYD

Keep it. It was my pleasure.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and

pass out. You'll be there before you

know it.

MARY

Thanks Lloyd.

(beat)

And good luck with your worms.

7.

POLICE OFFICER

Come on, move it, you're in a red

zone.

CUT TO:

ARMANI SUIT

She's gonna leave the briefcase at

the foot of the escalator. You make

the pick-up.

PLAID SPORTCOAT

Piece of cake.

LLOYD

(to car's driver)

Drive around me, you pinhead!

8.

LLOYD

Damn!

LLOYD

You can't do this! I'll lose my job!

CUT TO:

9.

MENTAL

Who the hell do you figure this guy's

working for?

SHAY

I don't know, but we'd better find

out...

SHAY (CONT'D)

Your ulcer?

MENTAL

It ain't gonna kill me.

HARRY

I got fired again.

LLOYD

I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but

let's face it, you are one pathetic

loser. No offense.

HARRY

None taken. Were you shitcanned,

too?

10.

LLOYD

Of course not.

(beat)

I quit.

HARRY

Why'd you quit?

LLOYD

I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire

me.

HARRY

Why didn't you wait and see if your

suspicions were well-founded?

LLOYD

Winners control their own destiny,

Har.

HARRY

You know, the thing that really chaps

my ass is that I just spent my life

savings turning my van into a poodle.

(beat)

The alarm alone cost me two hundred.

LLOYD

Big deal. That car's an old bomb

anyway.

HARRY

What are you talking about? It's

only six years old.

LLOYD

That's forty-two in dog years.

HARRY

What's with the briefcase?

LLOYD

It's a love memento.

HARRY

Huh?

11.

LLOYD

The most beautiful woman alive. Her

name was Mary. I drove her to the

airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran

high, breasts heaved. She left this

case in the terminal and flew to

Aspen and out of my life. End of

story.

HARRY

What's in it?

LLOYD

DO you really expect me to go snooping

around in someone else's private

property?

HARRY

Why not?

LLOYD

(beat)

It's locked.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

(WHISPERING to Harry)

Friend or foe?

HARRY

(WHISPERING)

We don't have any friends.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Can't recognize them. Could be student

loan thugs again, or the IRS, or

maybe somebody pissed off about that

case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced

a check on.

12.

LLOYD

Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little

swindlers gave me Peanut Butter

Praline.

HARRY

Well, whoever they are, they look

serious. One of them's even wearing

plaid.

LLOYD

(cringing)

That's a hostile pattern. I say we

bail and get down to unemployment.

CUT TO:

GRABNER

Gentlemen, I'm delighted to say that

neither I nor the unemployment

epartment of the state of Rhose Island

can do anything for you.

(beat)

You've run out of chances. You're

unemployable. Remember last year?

Middle of winter I busted my butt to

LLOYD

Blew it? For your information, we

only missed three days in two months.

HARRY

Yeah, and that was because of a

blizzard

13.

GRABNER

(exploding)

YOU WERE SNOW PLOW OPERATORS!

HARRY

Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find

something else for us. How about

another crack at that Suicide Hotline?

GRABNER

OUT!!!!!

CUT TO:

MENTAL

The briefcase ain't here. He must've

taken it with him.

J.P. SHAY

Shit.

(beat)

Well he's gotta come home sometime.

MENTAL

Maybe we should leave him a little

message to let 'em know we're playing

hardball.

MENTAL (CONT'D)

(a la Tweety Bird)

I taut I taw a puddy cat.

14.

MENTAL (CONT'D)

(still Tweety)

I did, I did...

DISSOLVE TO:

LLOYD

Give me what's left of our dough.

I'll go to the corner and buy a few

necessities.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night

Train?

HARRY

Get Robitussin it's a better buzz.

CUT TO:

LLOYD

Excuse me, little old lady, do you

have change for a dollar?

ELDERLY WOMAN

Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't...

LLOYD

Well could you do me a favor and

guard this while I go break a dollar?

My wallet's locked in this machine.

15.

ELDERLY LADY

Of course, young man...

CUT TO:

HARRY

Where's the booze?

LLOYD

It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma

Walton. She got my wallet, too.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Come on, man, cheer up. We've been

own before. I'm sure we'll land on

our heads somewhere.

HARRY

It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet

Petey he's... he's dead.

LLOYD

Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What

happened?

HARRY

His head fell off.

LLOYD

His head fell off?

16.

HARRY

Yeah, he was pretty old.

LLOYD

(hopeful)

I don't suppose he had a warranty...?

HARRY

Nah, I bought him used.

LLOYD

That's it! I've had it with this

ump! We don't have food, we don't

have jobs, our pets' heads are falling

off, we're surrounded by roving gangs

of larcenous old

HARRY

Okay, calm down.

LLOYD

No I won't calm down.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

What the hell are we doing here

anyway, Harry? We've got to get out

of this town.

HARRY

Yeah, and go where?

LLOYD

I'll tell you where: someplace warm,

a place where the beer flows like

wine, where beautiful women

instinctively flock like the salmon

of Capistrano.

(dramatic PAUSE)

I'm talking about Aspen.

HARRY

Aspen?

LLOYD

That's right, Aspen.

17.

HARRY

I don't know, Lloyd, the French are

assholes.

LLOYD

Let me ask you something: do you

want to end up like Petey dead in

some flea-ridden apartment, face-

down on a Dear Abby column, with a

soggy sunflower seed pressed against

your beak? Or do you want to enjoy

your life?

(beat)

Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's

eath be in vain. Don't you see what

he was saying? Spread your wings,

man. he was saying? Spread your wings,

man. Fly.

HARRY

(confused)

What are you talking about, Lloyd?

His head fell off.

(dawning realization)

Wait a second, I know what you're up

to. You just wanna go to Aspen so

you can find that girl who lost her

briefcase and you need me to drive

you there.

LLOYD

That's bullshit. I'll drive.

(beat)

And what's so wrong about going

someplace where we know someone who

can plug us into the social pipeline?

HARRY

(torn)

I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should

stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep

saving money for the worm store. I'm

getting a little sick and tired of

always running from creditors.

LLOYD

You know what I'm sick and tired of,

Harry? I'm sick and tired of having

to eek my way through life. I'm sick

and tired of being a nobody.

(MORE)

18.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

(beat)

But most of all, I'm sick and tired

of having nobody.

HARRY

Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss.

LLOYD

On the other hand, maybe you're right,

Harry. Maybe we should stay here and

try our luck in bankruptcy court.

With all those lawsuits against us,

I'm sure we'll win at least one. It

could be a boost to our egos.

HARRY

(emotional)

Petey, I made a promise to you once,

man...

(thinking hard)

...and I'll be damned if I can remember

what it was.

CUT TO:

19.

LLOYD & HARRY

"We've got to get out of this place,

If it's the last thing we ever do,

We've got to get out of this place,

Girl, there's a better life, for me

and you..."

LLOYD

Well, we're finally doing it. Do you

realize that in all the years we've

known each other, this is the first

time we've done this together.

HARRY

Been run out of town?

LLOYD

Taken a trip.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Why'd you do that?

HARRY

What?

LLOYD

Take your seatbelt off.

HARRY

Because we just cleared the danger

zone.

LLOYD

Huh?

HARRY

Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety

percent of all accidents happen within

five miles of home. We've already

traveled 6.3 miles.

LLOYD

Well what about the people who live

around here? What if we got into an

accident with one of them?

20.

HARRY

Where'd you get those?

LLOYD

Bought 'em when we filled up.

HARRY

Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer

on all expenditures. We're on a tight

budget, remember?

LLOYD

This didn't come out of our travel

fund. I was able to scrape up twenty-

five bucks before we left. You know,

so we could live in style.

HARRY

Where'd you get twenty-five extra

bucks?

LLOYD

I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.

HARRY

You mean the blind kid?

LLOYD

That's right.

HARRY

What did you sell him, Lloyd?

LLOYD

Just some odds and ends.

HARRY

Specifically?

LLOYD

Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of

marbles, Petey, three comic books a

second, are you telling me you sold

my dead bird to a blind kid? Well

who else was I gonna sell it to?

HARRY

But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a

head.

21.

LLOYD

Put your mind at ease, friend. I

took care of it.

CUT TO:

BILLY

Fly!

CUT TO:

MENTAL

Those bastards. They're rubbing it

right in our faces.

J.P. SHAY

Shit! Andre will have a goddamn

aneurysm if we don't get that

briefcase back.

MENTAL

Don't   worry, we'll get it back. And

I'll   tell you something else. They

ain't   gonna reach Aspen, either.

I'll   make sure of that.

22.

BILLY

Come on, boy, fly!

BILLY (CONT'D)

Excuse me, mister. Is there something

wrong with my bird?

MENTAL

Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew

south for the winter.

CUT TO:

HARRY

How far have we gone?

LLOYD

According to this map, about an inch

and a half.

HARRY

Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map

or we'll never get there. We don't

have enough gas money.

LLOYD

Relax. We have more than enough.

HARRY

I believe you're wrong, Lloyd.

LLOYD

And I believe I'm right, Harry.

HARRY

I still say wrong, Lloyd.

LLOYD

How much you wanna bet?

HARRY

I don't bet.

23.

LLOYD

What do you mean you don't bet?

HARRY

I mean I don't gamble, you know that.

Never have and never will.

LLOYD

Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal

that I can get you gambling before

the day's out.

HARRY

There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do

it.

LLOYD

I'll give you three-to-one odds.

That's three feedbags if you win,

against only one if you lose.

HARRY

You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I

already told you, I don't gamble.

LLOYD

Okay, five-to-one I can get you

gambling before the day's out.

HARRY

Sorry, pal, no way.

LLOYD

Make it ten-to-one.

HARRY

You got yourself a bet, sucker!

CUT TO:

24.

LLOYD

(to Waitress)

LLOYD (CONT'D)

What's the soup du jour?

WAITRESS

It's the soup-of-the-day.

LLOYD

Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.

WAITRESS

(sarcastic)

Anything else before I leave the

area?

HARRY

Actually, this chocolate milk isn't

mixed very well. Could you please

bring me a spoon?

WAITRESS

There. Now you don't need one.

25.

LLOYD

Uh-oh...

HARRY

What's the matter?

LLOYD

You spilled the salt. That's bad

luck. We're driving across the country

and the last thing we need is bad

luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt

over your right shoulder.

HARRY

What for?

LLOYD

Because that's good luck.

MALE VOICE

(o.s.)

What the fuck?!

LLOYD

Or was it the left shoulder?

TRUCKER

Who's the dead man threw shit in my

eye?

HARRY

It was a terrible accident, Sir.

Believe me, I would never do anything

to offend a man of your size. Please

accept my most sincere apology.

BURLY FRIEND #1

Teach him a lesson, Sea Bass!

26.

SEA BASS

You gonna eat that?

HARRY

Um... the thought had crossed my mind.

SEA BASS

Still want it?

HARRY

Nah, you go ahead.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HARRY

Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I

still haven't eaten.

LLOYD

Well if you'd stop picking fights

with the locals...

(brightening)

Wait a second. I think I just had an

idea. Follow me...

27.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like

to apologize for that unpleasant

scene a little earlier.

SEA BASS

Huh?

LLOYD

What I'm trying to say is, my friend

and I would like to buy you guys a

round of beers, just to bury the

hatchet.

SEA BASS

Make it four boiler-makers.

LLOYD

Whatever you want, sir. I'll have

the waitress send them over. Oh, and

fellas hope to see you again down

the road.

HARRY

Lloyd, what are you doing? You know

we can't afford to buy them drinks.

LLOYD

Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered

to pick up our check. They said just

add this to their tab.

CASHIER

(skeptical)

Sea Bass said that?

LLOYD

Well, if that guy at the table over

there is Sea Bass...

CASHIER

Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants...

28.

HARRY

Oh, and put these on there, too.

CASHIER

You got it.

LLOYD

(to Cashier)

By the way, how far is it to Rhode

Island from here?

CUT TO:

SEA BASS

I'm gonna kill those sons-of-bitches!

CASHIER

Hurry and you'll catch 'em. They was

on their way to Rhode Island.

CUT TO:

LLOYD

I just wish we could've seen Sea

Bass's face when he got the bill.

HARRY

I hope we never have to.

LLOYD

Don't worry. That fish-head is

probably half-way to Providence by

now.

29.

HARRY

I hope so.

LLOYD

Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a

whiz.

HARRY

Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now.

What if they figure out we went the

other way. They'll be on us in no

time.

LLOYD

But I gotta go. What am I supposed

to do?

HARRY

Hold it.

LLOYD

I can't hold it. I'm about to explode.

HARRY

Well... just take a whiz in an empty

beer bottle. There's a couple on the

floor in the back seat.

LLOYD

Are you serious?

HARRY

Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping

now. We could get killed.

LLOYD

Uh-oh...

HARRY

What's the matter?

LLOYD

The bottle's almost full and I'm

still going.

HARRY

Well stop going.

30.

LLOYD

I can't stop once I already started,

you know that. Quick, get me another

bottle.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Jesus, be careful! You almost went

off the road.

HARRY

I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best

I can.

LLOYD

Here, hold this.

HARRY

What are you, a goddamn camel?

LLOYD

Hey, I haven't gone all day.

STATE TROOPER

(o.s.)

Pull over!

HARRY

Huh?

31.

STATE TROOPER

PULL OVER!

HARRY

(calling out)

No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for

noticing!

HARRY (CONT'D)

Jesus, what is this, the fashion

police?

STATE TROOPER

PULL YOUR CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE

STATE TROOPER

License and registration, please.

STATE TROOPER (CONT'D)

You know, you fellas were all over

the road back there.

HARRY

Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty

in the car.

STATE TROOPER

Uh-huh.

(beat)

Have you boys been doing a little

rinking maybe?

HARRY

No, sir.

32.

STATE TROOPER

Then what's that?

HARRY

Oh, that's nothing, sir.

STATE TROOPER

Do you know it's against the law to

rive with an open alcohol container

in this state?

LLOYD

But, your honor, he's telling the

truth. It's not beer.

STATE TROOPER

Is that right?

HARRY

Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep

your mouth shut if you knew what was

good for you.

LLOYD

(under breath)

STATE TROOPER

(pained)

Get the hell out of here.

How does that feel, Lloyd?

(v.o.)

MARY

How's the other side?

34.

LLOYD

Nothing. Nothing at all.

MARY

(o.s.)

Lloyd, will you wash my nipples...?

CUT TO:

HARRY

(v.o.)

I don't know, Lloyd, I feel a little

sleazy staying here when we're not

even engaged.

LLOYD

(v.o.)

Hey, it's the only motel that charges

by the hour. We can't afford anything

else.

LLOYD

Yep, this sure is the life. Cold

beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink

sheets... You know, there's only one

thing that could make this moment

any better.

35.

HARRY

What's that?

LLOYD

If you had a nice set of knockers.

HARRY

That's two things, Lloyd.

LLOYD

Right now I'd settle for one.

HARRY

I don't know, Lloyd, these places

just don't do it for me. Brings back

too many memories.

LLOYD

What happened, Harry? Some little

filly break your heart?

HARRY

Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher.

We stayed at a place like this once

No-Tell Motel out on Route 31.

LLOYD

Felcher? You mean the babe who worked

for the tractor company?

HARRY

The same. We had this incredibly

romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd

be together forever.

(SIGHS)

Then about a week later, right out

of the blue, she sends me a John

Deere letter.

LLOYD

That's cold, Har. Give you any reason?

HARRY

I called her up and she gave me some

crap about me not listening to her

enough or something like that. I

wasn't really paying attention.

36.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Thing that really hurts is I think

she was seeing another guy. Never id

find out who.

CUT TO:

MENTAL

(into phone)

The boys are holed-up in a little

love nest for the night. I think

they're a couple of fucking weirdos.

ANDRE

What in hell are those guys up to?

Is it possible that they're Feds?

MENTAL

Unlikely from what I've seen.

ANDRE

I don't like this one goddamn bit,

Mental. You and Shay were supposed

to grab that bag so we could end

this shit. Now I don't know what the

hell's going on.

37.

MENTAL

Hold on a second, Mr. Andre...

MENTAL (CONT'D)

Sorry, boss. You were saying...?

ANDRE

Look, Mental, just find out what

they're up to. I want to know who

these guys are.

MENTAL

Don't worry. I'm on it.

SHAY

What the fuck...?

MENTAL

Where's the goddamn dog?

DISSOLVE TO:

38.

MARY

It just doesn't make any sense. I

left the money exactly where they

instructed me to.

HELEN

Actually, it makes a great deal of

sense, Mary. We should have called

in the authorities the moment we

knew Melvin had been kidnapped.

KARL

Now, Helen, we've been through this

already for Christ's sake, Karl,

these bastards will extort us into

bankruptcy if we let them.

MARY

But I'd never forgive myself if

something happened to Melvin.

KARL

Stop upsetting my daughter, Helen.

She's been through quite enough

already.

MARY

It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all

a little on edge.

ANDRE

Has there been any word, Mr. Swanson?

KARL

Nothing yet, Nicholas.

ANDRE

Perhaps I should call off the

Preservation benefit this weekend.

39.

HELEN

No, Nicholas, it's imperative that

we carry on as usual.

KARL

Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll do

everything they ask. Nothing's going

to happen to Melvin, I promise you.

MARY

Thank you, Daddy.

You're it. Quitsies.

Anti-quitsies. You're it. Quitsies.

No anti-quitsies. No startsies.

Damn, you're good, Harry.

Hey, didn't I tell you this trip

would be a blast?

LLOYD

See, I told you these country folks

were friendly, Harry.

SHAY

What happened?

These fuckers are really pissing me

off now.

CUT TO:

HARRY

Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd:

what exactly do we do when we get to

Aspen?

LLOYD

Well the first thing we do is take a

good deep breath of that famous

Aspenese air.

HARRY

Fresh, huh?

LLOYD

The freshest. They say on any day of

the week you can smell a moose-fart

ten miles away.

HARRY

(sincere)

Wow... talk about paradise.

(beat)

And after we're finished breathing,

what next, Lloyd?

LLOYD

Then we make a splash on the social

scene.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Harry, look the golden arches. Pull

over, I'm starving.

CUT TO:

MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE

...That's two cheese burgers, two fries,

and two medium Cokes. Five seventy-

two.

HARRY

Thanks.

42.

MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE

Hey!

HARRY

About this social scene how do you

expect a couple mutts like us to

make a splash in the land of pedigrees

when we don't even have any money?

LLOYD

Look, once we drop the briefcase off

to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll

plug us right into the party circuit.

After that, we do a little of the

ski

HARRY

Where'd you hear that?

LLOYD

Some bum down at unemployment.

HARRY

I don't know, Lloyd.

LLOYD

What's the matter?

HARRY

Money does terrible things to people.

I mean, we could lose our friendship.

43.

LLOYD

Yeah? So?

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Hey, wait a second. Hold everything.

HARRY

What?

LLOYD

Aren't you forgetting something?

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Back at Mickey D's? A little matter

you might've overlooked...?

HARRY

What?

LLOYD

My change.

HARRY

I think this guy's in trouble. Why

on't you pull over.

44.

MENTAL

You guys going as far as Des Moines?

My car died and I'm late for a

business meeting.

CUT TO:

HARRY

It's a fruit.

LLOYD

It's a vegetable.

HARRY

I'm telling you, it's a fruit.

LLOYD

And I happen to know it's a vegetable.

HARRY

Tell you what, why don't we leet an

impartial judge decide.

LLOYD

Fine with me.

HARRY

Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet:

Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

45.

LLOYD

Okay, Harry, my turn. Let 'er rip.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet,

aged to perfection will rip no fart

before it's time.

(beat)

Come on, Marquis of Dingleberry's

rules: you got ten seconds. All right.

I'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog

extra onions, garden salad with blue...

HARRY

And...?

LLOYD

Kit-Kat bar.

HARRY

You're the best, man.

(beat)

Okay, my turn.

LLOYD

Where are your manners, Harry? We

have a guest.

HARRY

Come on, Mr. Mentalino. Let one fly.

It's only a buck.

DISSOLVE TO:

46.

HARRY

I'll do one if you will.

LLOYD

Okay, you go first.

HARRY

No, you go first.

LLOYD

No, you go first.

MENTAL

Why don't you both stop being a couple

of pussies and go at the same time.

It ain't that hot.

LLOYD

Hmmm, not bad...

HARRY

Yeah, more tingly than hot.

MENTAL

Have some water. It'll help.

MENTAL (CONT'D)

Aw, shucks, that's right. Water just

makes it worse...

CUT TO:

47.

MENTAL

It's Mental. I'm just sitting down

to a nice meal with our boys.

ANDRE

Good work. What did you find out so

far?

MENTAL

Nothing yet, but I'm gonna shake 'em

own for information at lunch.

(beat)

Then I'm gonna kill 'em for dessert.

ANDRE

Well eat fast, time's running out.

MENTAL

Relax, they ain't gonna be running

around anywhere after I dump a little

cyanide in their pops.

HARRY

That really wasn't very polite of

him, was it? Maybe we should loosen

the screws of his chair.

LLOYD

Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you.

Perhaps it's about time you brushed

48.

HARRY

(humbled)

You mean like 'turn the other cheek?'

LLOYD

No, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.'

Hand me those peppers the atomic

ones.

HARRY

(whispering)

Here he comes.

MENTAL

Feeling any better, boys?

MENTAL (CONT'D)

So tell me, why you fellas headed to

Aspen? Vacation?

LLOYD

More like re-location.

MENTAL

Doesn't look like you packed much.

All I saw was a couple bags... and

that briefcase.

HARRY

The briefcase isn't even ours. Some

lady just left it at the airport.

We're bringing it back to her.

MENTAL

You mean you don't even know her?

LLOYD

Not really. I was just her limo river.

49.

MENTAL

Talk about being in the wrong place

at the wrong time...

HARRY

Hey, you okay, man? It was just a

goof.

MENTAL

(STRAINED WHISPER)

My ulcer... quick... pills... in my coat...

MENTAL (CONT'D)

You son-of-a-bitch!

CUT TO:

HARRY

I can't believe it...

50.

LLOYD

Life is a fragile thing, Har. One

minute you're chewing on a burger;

the next minute you're dead meat.

HARRY

But he blamed me. You heard him.

Those were his last words.

LLOYD

If you don't count that gurgling

sound.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Hey, relax, man, I'm just as

responsible as you are we both

slipped him the peppers and look at

me, I on't feel guilty at all.

HARRY

Small comfort coming from a man who

sells dead birds to blind kids.

(SIGHS)

Don't you get it, Lloyd. I've got a

ead guy pissed at me. His restless

spirit will probably haunt me for

the next seventy-five years.

LLOYD

That's ridiculous. You probably won't

live to see forty.

HARRY

Oh yeah.

(beat)

Wow. What a relief.

CUT TO:

51.

DOCTOR

...My official conclusion is that the

eceased expired from oxygen eprivation

caused by the presence of cyanide in

the bloodstream.

DT. DALE

You mean he was poisoned?

DOCTOR

Unquestionably. We found these by

the body.

COP

Waitress says he was with a couple

of younger guys. They're the ones

who called the ambulance then they

hit the road.

DT. DALE

Any idea where they were going?

COP

A witness at the next table thought

he heard them say they were driving

to France.

COP (CONT'D)

We got a report they were seen heading

west on I-80 toward Colorado.

DT. DALE

Get a make on the vehicle?

COP

Yes, sir. They were driving an '84

poodle.

DT. DALE

An '84 what?

52.

COP

(straight-faced)

Well it might have been a wire-haired

terrier, Detective. They're very

similar in appearance.

CUT TO:

HARRY

Let's get off and crash at a motel

before I crash into one.

(yawning)

I need a crib fast.

LLOYD

Sorry, Har. We're gonna have to hold

out. Seems we misjudged our expense

allocation. If we pay for a motel we

won't have enough for gas.

HARRY

What happened to the dough?

LLOYD

We over-leveraged.

HARRY

On what?

LLOYD

I sprung for Mr. Chili Pepper's last

meal. Felt it was the least we could

o after we deep-sixed him.

HARRY

Wait a second one burger put us

over budget?

LLOYD

The slob ordered a double-bacon eluxe

and a chocolate malt.

HARRY

Oh.

(beat)

So what are we gonna do?

53.

LLOYD

Drive. We've only got ten more hours.

We can take turns.

CUT TO:

SHAY

You heard me, he's dead. The bastards

killed him.

ANDRE

Jesus Christ...

ANDRE (CONT'D)

All right, I want you back here now.

If they're coming this way I'm going

to need you.

SHAY

(v.o.)

How's our bankroll doing? Giving you

a hard time?

ANDRE

Melvin's not the problem. It's these

two other guys that have me worried.

I wish I knew what the hell they

ANDRE

How you doing today, Melvin?

54.

CUT TO:

HARRY

Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump.

55.

HARRY

Skis, huh?

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

That's right.

HARRY

Great.

HARRY (CONT'D)

They yours?

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Uh-huh..

HARRY

Both of 'em?

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Um, yeah.

HARRY

(impressed)

Cool.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere.

56.

SEA BASS

Well, well, well, if it ain't my old

friend.

(checks watch)

And right on time...

CUT TO:

57.

HARRY

(re: suitcases in

back seat)

That's a lot of luggage for a little

vacation.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Actually, I'm moving to Aspen. I've

got to get away from my boyfriend.

HARRY

(holding out mirror)

Here, this is a little loose.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Allow me...

HARRY (CONT'D)

Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen

we can meet up... you know, for hot

chocolate or something.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Why not? You seem pretty harmless.

I'll give you my number. Just let me

find a pen.

58.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)

I know I have one here somewhere...

HARRY

(urgently)

Look, why don't you just tell it to

me, I've got a good memory.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Are you sure you won't forget?

HARRY

(desperate)

Positive please hurry.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Is something wrong?

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)

Okay, my number is 652-2553.

(beat)

Oh, wait a second, that's my old

number. It's so funny how your mind

god sakes, give me the damn number!

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)

Look, man, if you're gonna get pushy

you can just forget it!

SEA BASS

First I'm gonna rape you, then I'm

gonna kill you. Any last request?

LLOYD

Um, yeah could you do it the other

way around?

59.

HARRY

You've got some serious explaining

to o, young man.

CUT TO:

LLOYD

Look, Harry, I told you what happened,

now drop it.

HARRY

Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to

mention another word about you being

in a bathroom stall with a six-foot,

five-inch trucker with his pants

own.

LLOYD

That's a low blow, man.

HARRY

Not at that height it's not.

LLOYD

Listen, bud, if you're trying to

imply that I'm that thought look,

we're almost in Colorado.

60.

HARRY

I think it's about   time we pull over

and change seats.   I've been driving

for nine straight   hours I  don't

have the energy to   start a new state.

CUT TO:

DT. DALE

Any sign of them yet?

COP

No, but we're expecting them shortly.

A motorist said he spotted a pooch

about thirty miles back headed this

way.

CUT TO:

LLOYD

Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky...

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Boy, some guys just weren't cut out

for life on the road.

61.

DISSOLVE TO:

LLOYD

Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back.

HARRY

(groggy)

How long have I been out?

LLOYD

I'd say a good five hours, anyway.

HARRY

Great. We must be getting real close,

huh?

LLOYD

Should be. I've been averaging about

ninety miles an hour all night.

HARRY

Good man.

LLOYD

Boy, I'll tell you, this is one

angerous highway. You wouldn't believe

all the road pizza two dead ogs, a

couple of rabbits, a snake and some

big thing I couldn't even recognize.

HARRY

That's awful. Did you see them get

hit or were they already lying there?

LLOYD

I hit 'em.

62.

HARRY

Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains

to be a little rockier than this.

LLOYD

I was thinking the same thing. That

John Denver's some full of shit,

huh?

LLOYD (CONT'D)

I must say, Des Moines sure is a

pretty little town.

HARRY

Yeah, it really is.

(beat)

Wait a minute when did you visit

Des Moines?

LLOYD

Last night. We drove through it.

HARRY

What are you talking about? You were

snoring like a baby when we went

through Des Moines.

LLOYD

(sing-song)

Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and

shine.

(LAUGHS)

You were the one who was asleep,

HARRY

Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't

the sun rise in the east and set in

the west?

LLOYD

In our country it does, yes.

63.

HARRY

Then perchance you can explain to me

why the sun is in our face at 7:30

in the morning when we're heading

west.

CUT TO:

LLOYD

I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can

make a mistake.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Come on, man, pull yourself together.

HARRY

You know, I got half a mind to just

jump on the bus to Europe and say

goodbye to your ugly mug forever.

LLOYD

(rolls his eyes)

You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo.

HARRY

Oh yeah? Why not?

LLOYD

You don't have a passport.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Come on, stop being a baby about

this. Okay, so we back-tracked a

tad.

HARRY

A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a

sixth of the way across the country

in the wrong direction. Now we don't

have enough money to get to Aspen,

we on't have enough money to get

home, we don't have enough to eat,

we don't have enough to sleep!

64.

LLOYD

Well it doesn't do any good having

you sitting there on your butt whining

about it. If we're gonna get out of

this hole, we're gonna have to dig

ourselves out.

HARRY

You know, you're absolutely right,

Lloyd.

LLOYD

Where you going?

HARRY

Home. I'm walking home.

LLOYD

You can't be serious.

HARRY

(sarcastic)

Why not? We're probably only five

miles away.

LLOYD

(CALLING OUT)

Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you

never screwed up.

HARRY

Look, man... I'm sorry.

(beat)

I never should have let you talk me

into this in the first place. You've

got a good reason to goo a beautiful

girl's waiting for you. But let's

face it, Lloyd, there's nothing

waiting for me in Aspen.

(beat)

There's nothing waiting for me

anywhere.

65.

CUT TO:

LLOYD

Got room for one more, if you still

want to go to Aspen.

HARRY

Where'd you find this baby?

LLOYD

Used car dealer. I   traded the van

for it. Plus I got   the guy to throw

in fifty bucks for   gas money.

(beat)

Come on, man, what   do you say? We

still partners?

CUT TO:

DT. DALE

It doesn't make sense. They should've

been here hours ago.

COP

Maybe they're smarter than we thought.

66.

DT. DALE

How smart can they be? They're riving

a goddamn dog!

COP #2

We just got a report that they were

spotted about two hours ago heading

east near Des Moines on I-80.

DT. DALE

(incredulous)

Des Moines?! Why that's five hundred

miles from here!

COP #1

Guess they got wind of our welcoming

party.

DT. DALE

We're wasting time. Let's mobilize.

CUT TO:

LLOYD

Tell me something, Harry. Would you

really have kept going home if I

HARRY

Well let me put it this way, Lloyd:

Do you remember when we were Cub

Scouts and we got lost in the woods

uring that blizzard? We huddled

together all night, and we made an

oath that if we ever got out of there

alive we'd never ever leave each

other's side again. Do you remember

that?

LLOYD

We were never Cub Scouts.

67.

HARRY

Exactly.

HARRY (CONT'D)

What the hell is this? There's a

coffin in the back!

LLOYD

Relax, it's empty.

HARRY

I don't give a shit. I'm not driving

anywhere with a casket. You know I'm

superstitious calm down. We'll dump

it off first chance we get.

WOMAN

I married a cheapskate.

MAN

Shut your trap, Gerdie.

WOMAN

I'm so embarrassed. I'll never be

able to show my face again.

MAN

I knew something good would come out

of this.

WOMAN

We could have given him a more

ignified burial.

68.

MAN

Your uncle was a cheap man. Remember

what he got us for our twenty-fifth?

A friggin' fern. There's no way I'm

gonna spend a load to get him planted.

CUT TO:

WOMAN

You son-of-a-bitch! I want a ivorce!

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

69.

LLOYD

Isn't this wonderful? What more could

a couple of single guys like us ask

for?

HARRY

How about food and shelter?

LLOYD

You're so materialistic.

(beat)

Why don't we get down to business

and eliver the briefcase to Mary.

Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in

for tea and a strumpet or two?

HARRY

Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes

the lovely young lady reside?

LLOYD

Um... good question.

HARRY

Well what's her last name? We'll

look it up in the phone book.

LLOYD

Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I

caught that either.

HARRY

What about the briefcase, Lloyd?

There must've been a name on it,

right?

LLOYD

(brightening)

Come to think of it, there is. It's

engraved right into the leather.

HARRY

What is it?

LLOYD

Samsonite   spelled just like it

sounds.

70.

CUT TO:

HARRY

Any soup left?

LLOYD

A little. Shall we share it?

HARRY

Please.

LLOYD

Mmmm mmmm good...

HARRY

Hey, you got something stuck in your

front teeth.

LLOYD

Hmmm... looks like an old piece of

Beef Jerky.

HARRY

Wanna split it?

LLOYD

You're pathetic. Get your own.

71.

HARRY

I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd.

LLOYD

Roll up your window.

HARRY

It is rolled up.

LLOYD

Then I guess the damn anti-cold system

isn't working. You really should get

it fixed if we're gonna live here

all winter.

HARRY

What anti-cold system?

LLOYD

Right here the A/C button. I put it

on full blast about an hour ago and,

if anything, the car's getting colder.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

What are you going out there for?

HARRY

To warm up.

LLOYD

What are you worrying about now?

HARRY

I'm worried about how you're gonna

survive the pummeling I'm about to

give you.

LLOYD

Huh?

72.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Harry, calm down! You're acting like

a wild animal!

HARRY

Get over here and take your medicine,

Lloyd!

LLOYD

Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine.

I'm a Christian Scientist!

LLOYD (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

HARRY

Something I should've done a long

time ago. This stupid thing has been

the root of our problems all along.

LLOYD

Don't do anything foolish, Harry.

HARRY

Foolish? This is the most sensible

thing I've done in years. I'm gonna

toss this goddamn curse right into

that river.

LLOYD

You're making a big mistake, Harry!

I'll never forgive you for this!

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get

better, I promise! In fact, I think

73.

HARRY

You're bluffing.

LLOYD

No I'm not, man look.

HARRY

That's a filling, you liar!

HARRY (CONT'D)

I used to have a life! A miserable

one, but a life, nonetheless!

LLOYD

(CHOKED VOICE)

Harry, look!

CUT TO:

LLOYD

Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a

few bucks just a small loan from

the briefcase, and we check into a

cheap motel.

74.

HARRY

Sounds good.

LLOYD

And we'll keep track of the money we

spend with IOUs.

HARRY

We'll be meticulous    right down to

the last penny.

LLOYD

That way, whatever we borrow we can

pay back.

HARRY

Absolutely. We're good for it.

LLOYD

You know, as soon as we get jobs.

HARRY

It'll come right out of our first

paycheck.

CUT TO:

BARNARD

...This is the Hotel Danbury's

Presidential Suite, gentlemen. It's

normally reserved for royalty,

visiting dignitaries, and illustrious

stars of stage and take it.

BARNARD (CONT'D)

Very good, sir. Are there any bags

you'd like sent up?

LLOYD

Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our

own chicks.

BARNARD

(peevish)

I wasn't talking about ladies.

75.

HARRY

Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up.

What are their names?

BARNARD

Sir, I meant your luggage.

LLOYD

Tell you what you can send up, my

friend how about some chow?

BARNARD

I'll bring you a menu.

LLOYD

Don't bother. Just order us one of

everything.

HARRY

One of everything? Lloyd...

LLOYD

Oh, sorry.

(beat)

Make that two of everything.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

And here you go, Barney. You keep us

happy, we'll keep you happy.

BARNARD

Yes, sir!

76.

LLOYD

(proudly)

Our first IOU. Signed and dated.

CUT TO:

HELEN

Mary? You awake?

MARY

(o.s.)

HELEN

I brought you some tea. I thought it

might help you relax.

MARY

Thank you.

MARY (CONT'D)

Yech! What's in this, whiskey?

HELEN

Uh, sorry... that one's mine.

HELEN (CONT'D)

Feeling any better, honey?

MARY

Just knowing that Melvin's out there,

being held by God knows who...

(fighting back tears)

It's all my fault. I should've been

there.

77.

HELEN

Bullshit. You can't blame yourself

for this. If you'd been there they

would've taken you, too.

MARY

Maybe we should just pay them the

money again and get this thing over

HELEN

Now Mary, everything that can be

done is being done. You've got to

stop torturing yourself.

MARY

What am I supposed to do? Go about

my life as if everything were fine?

HELEN

That's exactly what you should do.

Get the hell out more, go skiing,

socialize. Don't you see, honey? We

can't let on that anything is wrong.

If the press or authorities get wind

of this, the kidnappers might panic.

(beat)

Who knows what they'd do to poor

Melvin then?

CUT TO:

78.

HARRY

Oh god, it's really true. Last night

I thought I might've been dreaming.

LLOYD

It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked

the big time.

HARRY

And it was so simple. All it took

was somebody else's money.

HARRY (CONT'D)

You know, Lloyd, I think you might've

gone a little overboard with the

spending today.

LLOYD

What's the big deal? We're gonna pay

it all back anyway, right?

HARRY

Sure, but do you really think you

needed to buy those two surfboards?

LLOYD

Surfboards? I thought those were

beginner's skis.

HARRY

Ahhh. I was wondering why you had

those bindings put on them.

LLOYD

Where'd this come from?

HARRY

(sheepishly)

I bought it.

LLOYD

What for?

79.

HARRY

I like the feel of it against my

skin...

(defensive)

...I mean, you know, when a woman's

wearing it.

LLOYD

Harry, how many women do you know

who wear a size XXL?

HARRY

Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now.

I'm supposed to have a few

eccentricities.

LLOYD

Enter, parlez vous!

BARNARD

I brought you your newspaper and

some champagne, gentlemen.

Unfortunately, we didn't seem to

have the, um, label you requested.

LLOYD

All out of Boone's Farm, huh?

BARNARD

You have a rapier wit, sir. I took

the liberty of bringing a comparable

substitute: Dom Perignon.

LLOYD

Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?

BARNARD

Thank you so much, sir.

80.

LLOYD

Oh, one more thing: You can     dispense

with the 'sir' crap. Let's     face it,

Barney, we're all from the     same mold.

(winks)

We just have a little more     dough

than you right now.

HARRY

Cocktail hour has commenced!

HARRY (CONT'D)

Hey, later on what do you say we...?

HARRY (CONT'D)

Lloyd... you okay?

LLOYD

(dumbstruck)

Harry, it's her.

HARRY

Who?

LLOYD

Mary with the briefcase. This is

her...

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Mary Swanson...

HARRY

Come on, Cinderella, it's time to

get you ready for the ball...

81.

DISSOLVE TO:

82.

LLOYD

Thanks for the lift, Barney.

ANDRE

Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a

five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.

LLOYD

This should cover a couple plates.

HARRY

I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if

we want seconds?

LLOYD

Put us down for four plates, my good

man.

J.P. SHAY

(WHISPERING)

Jesus Christ, boss... it's them.

LLOYD

I'm getting nervous, Harry.

83.

HARRY

relax, Lloyd. These people are just

like you and me.

LLOYD

What are you talking about? They're

educated, well-bred, charming, and

sophisticated.

HARRY

So what? We can be sophistica holy

shit, would you look at the fun bags

on that hose hound.

LLOYD

Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm

already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't

like me?

HARRY

Look, let's just go saddle up to the

bar and down a couple bowls of

loudmouth soup. A little booze'll

bring back that old Lloyd Christmas

over-confidence.

LLOYD

(to BARTENDER)

Two martinis, straight up.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Shut up, Harry.

HARRY

I didn't say anything.

LLOYD

Yeah, well I know what you were gonna

say and I'm telling you to shut up

in advance.

HARRY

How do you know what I was gonna

say?

84.

LLOYD

I read you like a book.

HARRY

Okay, if you read me like a book

then what was I gonna say?

LLOYD

You were gonna say:

(in Harry's looped

VOICE)

'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't

mind roasting my weenie in.'

LLOYD (CONT'D)

And I would say 'shut up', because

this is our chance to get in with

the rich and powerful and you don't

ingratiate yourself to the kind of

people by acting like Ron Jeremy on

Spanish Fly.

ANDRE

If I could have your attention,

please...

ANDRE (CONT'D)

I'd like to thank you all for coming

to this very special event. As you

85.

MR. SWANSON

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the

Icelandic Snow Owl.

MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)

These magnificent specimens were

MR. SWANSON

Here these lovely birds will be

allowed to breed in a natural but

protected habitat. And, God willing,

with your help and that of the

Society's, we will see these wonderful

creatures flourish once more.

MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)

Again, thank you, and enjoy your

evening. Oh, and feel free to take a

closer look at our new friends here.

Enjoy.

LLOYD

Two more, please.

HARRY

Lloyd, I've never seen you this

uptight. You've gotta chill out.

LLOYD

I can't help it. This is a very

important night for me.

(MORE)

86.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

(beat)

Harry, have you ever wondered why

you and I never have long-term

girlfriends?

HARRY

What are you talking about? I went

out with Fraida Felcher for two and

a half weeks.

LLOYD

That was a fluke.

(beat)

The reason we never have long-term

girlfriends is because of one thing:

We're afraid of the C word.

HARRY

That's crazy. We live for the C word.

LLOYD

I'm talking bout commitment.

HARRY

(beat)

Oh.

LLOYD

Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry.

The first time I laid eyes on Mary

Swanson, I knew she was the one.

(beat)

Some things you feel in your heart,

other things you feel in your groin.

This girl makes me feel it all in

the heart.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Oh shit, there she is.

87.

HARRY

(checking her out)

Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd.

She's an angel.

(beat)

Well, what are you waiting for? Get

over there and talk to her.

LLOYD

She's gonna think I'm some kind of

psycho when she realizes how far I

came just to see her.

HARRY

You have her briefcase she's gonna

be thrilled to see you.

LLOYD

And then what? She'll take it back

and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.

HARRY

Look, man, you just drove two thousand

miles to see this girl. Don't quit

on the last fifty feet.

LLOYD

(brightening)

Wait a second, I have an idea. You

go over and introduce yourself. That

way you can build me up so when I

come along I won't have to brag about

myself. Tell her I'm good-looking

and I'm rich and I have a rapist's

wit.

HARRY

I can't tell her you're good looking,

Lloyd she's got eyes.

LLOYD

Please Harry, I'm appealing to you

as one loser to another. Just build

me up and then give me a signal to

come over. Please.

88.

HARRY

All right. But you're gonna owe me a

big one for this.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Nice set of hooters you got there.

MARY

I beg your pardon?

HARRY

The owls. They're beautiful.

MARY

Oh. Yeah.

(beat)

Are you a bird lover?

HARRY

Well, I used to have a parakeet, but

my main area of expertise is canines

that's dogs to the layperson.

MARY

Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how

HARRY

Oh, I've trained them, bathed them,

clipped them; I've even bred them.

MARY

Really? Any unusual breeding?

HARRY

Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But

one time we successfully mated a

Bulldog and a Shitzu.

MARY

Really? That's weird.

HARRY

Yeah. We called it a Bullshit.

(breaks out LAUGHING)

Just a little breeder joke.

89.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Anyway, the real reason I came over

is because I want to introduce you

to a friend of mine.

HELEN

Mary, I don't believe I've met your

friend.

MARY

Actually, we haven't been introduced

yet.

(holds out hand)

I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my

stepmother, Helen.

HARRY

Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you

both.

HELEN

I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne.

I was hoping we'd get a chance to

meet.

HARRY

(taken aback)

You were?

HELEN

That tuxedo I love a man with a

sense of humor. So does Mary.

HARRY

Really?

HARRY (CONT'D)

Anyway, about my friend you doing

anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because

I believe Mary's looking for somebody

to hit the slopes with. Whuh?

MARY

Helen, you're embarrassing me.

90.

HELEN

Well you are, aren't you?

(to Harry)

Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So

what do you say, Harry? Are you

available?

HARRY

Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend

your friends for one day. You and

Mary will have a ball.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Um... well... I don't know. You see, the

thing is... sure.

LLOYD

How come you didn't call me over?

HARRY

Relax, you're golden. I got you a

ate with her tomorrow.

LLOYD

Wha... you... I... it's...

(smiles)

I love you, man. I love you!

HARRY

Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making

a scene.

LLOYD

This calls for a toast!

91.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

You're gonna be my best man, Har, I

mean it. It was always between you

and my future wife's brother, but

you just earned a seat at the head

table, pal.

HARRY

(under breath)

I think we've done enough hobnobbing,

Lloyd.

CUT TO:

J.P. SHAY

Maybe it was just a coincidence.

ANDRE

Don't be stupid. It's a message,

plain and simple: We killed their

bird, now they killed ours.

92.

J.P. SHAY

But how could anybody off a bird

with a cork?

ANDRE

These guys arent' just anybody.

They're good. Look what they did to

Mental. He was the best, and yet he

fell right into their web.

J.P. SHAY

But the bastards already got our

money. What the hell more could they

want?

ANDRE

(at wit's end)

I don't know, god damn it!

CUT TO:

LLOYD

Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs.

Mary Christmas. You

HARRY

Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you

think you may be jumping the gun a

little? I mean, who knows, when you

get to know her, you may find out

she's not your type.

LLOYD

Impossible. I know my type    when I

see it. Now let me get this    straight,

she wants me to meet her at    the

Avalanche Bar and Grill on    Main

Street?

HARRY

That's what she said. Ten o'clock

sharp.

93.

LLOYD

Time out. Where are going ressed

like that.

HARRY

I, uh, thought while you were making

your love connection I'd try my luck

on the slopes.

LLOYD

You mean you're gonna go out in public

dressed in tights?

HARRY

These aren't tights. They're

fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers.

LLOYD

But you can see the outline of your

who-who.

HARRY

Really?

LLOYD

Turn sideways.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Actually, it's just a tiny little

lump. No one will ever notice.

HARRY

You're right. I can't go out dressed

like this.

CUT TO:

94.

HARRY

Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving

a clutch with these things.

HARRY

(CALLING OUT)

You take the first run alone. I'm

gonna loosen up down here.

CUT TO:

WAITER

I'm sorry, we don't open until eleven.

LLOYD

I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait

at the bar?

CUT TO:

MARY

Beautiful day, huh, Harry?

95.

HARRY

Glorious.

MARY

God, it feels so good to get up here.

I haven't been outdoors much in the

last couple of weeks.

HARRY

Why not?

MARY

(evasive)

There's been... family problems. I

on't want to bore you with them.

HARRY

Thanks.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Oh, look... frost.

MARY

Are you okay?

HARRY

(lisping)

Sure. I do this all the time...

CUT TO:

HARRY

(lisping)

See ya at the bottom...

CUT TO:

96.

HARRY

(lisping)

Hi.

(off their looks)

Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to

have a cup of warm water, would you?

CUT TO:

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Hi.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)

Bad day, huh?

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)

(big smile)

well don't worry, Mercury's supposed

to be coming out or retrograde

tonight. Things will get better.

CUT TO:

97.

MARY

My god. Harry, are you okay?

HARRY

(lisping)

I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off.

CUT TO:

SHAY

You're luck just ran out, pal.

MARY

This is silly. Let me help you...

MIME

GODDAMN IT! WHAT THE FUCK?!

CUT TO:

98.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

...Anyway, after my boyfriend backed

into my garage for the third time, I

said to myself, 'Run, Cathy, run for

your life before he kills you both'.

Then you know what the klutz does

and to be perfectly honest, I on't

really care.

(beat)

Look, I'm sorry, but I'm not very

good company today. I'll say.

(beat)

I have an idea. Why don't you tell

me a little about yourself.

LLOYD

Maybe some other time.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to

know a Mary Swanson, would you?

BARTENDER

Sure. Her family comes in here all

the time.

LLOYD

Do you know where she lives?

BARTENDER

Yeah, they got that big place up on

Alpine Drive.

CUT TO:

MARY

I've got to tell you, today was really

just what I needed. Thanks a lot,

Harry.

HARRY

My pleasure, Mary.

99.

MARY

So you'll pick me up tonight at 7:45?

HARRY

Better make it quarter to eight.

I've got a few things to take care

of first.

HARRY (CONT'D)

(to himself)

Mary Dunne... Mrs. Mary Dunne... Got a

nice ring to it.

LLOYD

Some best man.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

HARRY

It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd.

She told me ten o'clock sharp. Are

you sure you went to the right bar?

LLOYD

Believe me, it was the right place.

(SIGHS)

I don't know, Har, maybe she just

had second thoughts.

HARRY

I have a hard time believing that,

Lloyd. The girl said she couldn't

wait to see you again.

100.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Wait a minute...

LLOYD

What?

HARRY

It just occurred to me. She must've

meant ten o'clock at night.

LLOYD

(brightening)

Do ya think...?

HARRY

Of course! Why would she have you

meet her at a bar at ten in the

morning?

LLOYD

(shrugging)

I just figured she was a raging

alcoholic.

HARRY

Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?

LLOYD

I knew there was an explanation. And

here I thought she was standing me

up.

HARRY

That'll teach you to jump to

conclusions.

(beat)

Anyway, since you have your night

all

LLOYD

Will you join me in a good luck toast

before you head out?

101.

HARRY

(o.s.)

Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think

will help your chances.

LLOYD

Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't

you?

HARRY

Uh... it's for mature audiences. I

on't wanna chance getting turned

away at the door.

LLOYD

I see.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

To my friend Harry the matchmaker.

HARRY

Mmmmm...

CUT TO:

102.

MARY

Hi. Come on in.

MARY

Make yourself at home. I'm almost

ready. Just give me one more minute.

MARY

(o.s.)

Are you in there, Harry?

HARRY

(nervously)

Be right out.

MARY

(o.s.)

I hope you're not using the toilet.

It's broken.

HARRY

Huh?

103.

MARY

(o.s.)

It doesn't flush.

HARRY

Um, no, I was just... shaving.

MARY

Shaving?

HARRY

(o.s.)

Yeah! I was running a little late.

Thought this would save time.

MARY

Okay. Well I'll be in the living

room whenever you're ready.

HARRY

(under breath)

Come on, flush, you bastard...

REPORTER

We'll be back in a minute with the

story of the blind Indiana boy who

was duped into buying a dead parakeet.

BLIND BOY

...I thought he was real quiet...

104.

MARY

Yes...?

LLOYD

Hi.

(beat)

Don't you remember me?

MARY

Um... I'm not really...

LLOYD

South Bend. I drove you to the airport

last week.

MARY

(dawning on her)

Oh my god. Lloyd, right?

LLOYD

You remembered.

MARY

What are you doing in Aspen?

LLOYD

I brought you your briefcase You

left it at the airport so I picked

it up for you.

MARY

You're the one who took my briefcase?

LLOYD

Yeah, it's back at my hotel room.

Come on, let's take a ride. I'll

give it to you.

MARY

Wait right here.

105.

MARY (CONT'D)

Harry, what are you doing in there?

HARRY

Uh... just cleaning my teeth. Give

me a minute, Mary, I'll be right

with you.

MARY

(o.s.)

Sorry, but something important's

come up and I have to run out. It's

sort of an emergency. I'll explain

later.

HARRY

But Mary --

MARY

(o.s.)

--I'm really sorry, Harry. I promise

we'll do this another time.

HARRY

Great...

CUT TO:

106.

ANDRE

They're mine...

LLOYD

..So anyway, as soon as I got to

town I tried to look you up but I

idn't know your last name.

MARY

I don't believe it. You really have

it.

LLOYD

'Course I have it. When Lloyd

Christmas drives a woman to the

airport, he makes sure she gets all

her luggage, no matter what he has

to

MARY

This is incredible. You mean to say

you drove two thousand miles just

for me?

LLOYD

Well... no... I mean, you know, there

were other reasons...

(beat)

Actually, yeah, I guess I did.

MARY

That is the sweetest thing I've ever

heard.

107.

CUT TO:

HARRY

(MUMBLING to himself)

It's all Kharma, Harry. You screw

your best friend over and it's gonna

come back to haunt you, plain and

simple...

CUT TO:

LLOYD

Look, Mary, I know this may seem a

little sudden but I've given it a

lot of thought: You're the woman

I've been waiting for my whole life,

and I'm not ashamed to admit it --

(holds up his hand)

--Please, let me finish.

(DEEP BREATH)

I'm crazy about you. I've never felt

this way about anyone. You make it

so easy for me to tell you my

innermost desires.

(NERVOUS LAUGH)

Listen to me, I feel like a schoolboy

again.

(beat)

A schoolboy who desperately wants to

make sweet, sweet love to you.

MARY

Oh... I thought I heard you talking

to someone.

108.

LLOYD

Mary...

(BLURTING OUT)

I desperately want to make love to a

schoolboy.

MARY

(taken aback)

Maybe I should be going now.

LLOYD

No, that's not what Imeant. I meant...

I really like you, Mary. I like you

a lot.

LLOYD (CONT'D)

I'm gonna ask you something flat out

and I want you to answer me honestly:

What do you think the chances are of

a girl like you and a guy like me

ending up together?

MARY

Lloyd, that's difficult to say. I

LLOYD

--I asked you to be honest, Mary.

MARY

But Lloyd, I really can't --

LLOYD

--Come    on, give it to me straight. I

rove a    long way to see you, the least

you can    do is level with me. What

are my    chances?

MARY

Not good.

LLOYD

You mean not good, like one out of a

hundred?

109.

MARY

I'd say more like one out of a

million.

LLOYD

(Duh)

So you're telling me there's a chance?

MARY

Nicholas... what are you doing here?

ANDRE

I've been looking for you, Mary.

LLOYD

Husband?

ANDRE

Aren't you two going to invite me

in?

CUT TO:

WOMAN'S VOICE

(o.s.)

Hey!

HARRY

You...? What are you doing here?

CUT TO:

110.

ANDRE

Well at least you two got to say

your goodbyes.

LLOYD

Who are you?

ANDRE

Don't play dumb with me, asshole.

I'm the rightful ower of that

briefcase you've been carrying.

LLOYD

Uh-oh.

MARY

Nicholas, you... you motherfucker!

My family trusted you!

ANDRE

Shut up!

LLOYD

Uh, sir, about the briefcase, I want

you to know, my friend Harry and I

have every intention of reimbursing

you.

ANDRE

Open that damn thing!

ANDRE (CONT'D)

What the hell's this? Where's all

the money?

LLOYD

That's as good as money, sir. Those

are our IOUs. You can add them up

yourself. Every penny's accounted

for.

ANDRE

You're fucking dead!

111.

LLOYD

Now don't do anything hasty, man.

CUT TO:

HARRY

Lloyd, are you home? We've gotta

talk, man. I have a serious confession

to make.

HARRY (CONT'D)

Oh good, you found her. I'll just

leave you two kids alone.

ANDRE

Why don't you stay and join the party?

CUT TO:

ANDRE

..I want a one-way ticket to Rio De

Janerio departing as soon as

possible...

MARY

You mean you two know each other?

112.

LLOYD

(cutting)

Yeah, we used to be best friends.

HARRY

Until he turned into a backstabber.

LLOYD

Me a backstabber? You got a lot of

nerve. I saw her first.

HARRY

Hey, I couldn't help it if she found

me irresistable.

LLOYD

But you knew how crazy I was about

her.

HARRY

Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was

about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't

stop you, did it?

LLOYD

(waning righteousness)

What are you talking about?

HARRY

Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me

the whole sordid story.

LLOYD

Look... I was gonna tell you about

that. It was gonna be mentioned at

the reading of my will. I swear, you

can ask my lawyer.

HARRY

Well I guess we both learned a little

something about each other, didn't

we?

LLOYD

You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as

good friends as we thought we were.

113.

HARRY

Guess not.

LLOYD

I mean, if one beautiful girl   could

rip us apart like this, then   it seems

our friendship isn't worth a   damn.

(beat)

Maybe we should call it quits   right

here.

HARRY

Just tell me where to sign, bud.

ANDRE

Okay, which one of you losers wants

to die first?

HARRY

I wouldn't pull that trigger if I

were you.

ANDRE

Why not? It'll look like just another

Aspen love triangle. You caught the

two of them in bed, handcuffed them

to the post, murdered them, and killed

yourself.

HARRY

(smug)

Except you're forgetting one minor

etail.

ANDRE

What's that?

HARRY

If you kill us, you'd be killing

yourself.

ANDRE

(puzzled)

Huh?

114.

HARRY

You see, philosophers believe that

we're all really just tiny pieces of

one huge universal being. In other

words, I am you and you are me, so

if you were to kill us you'd be

committing suicide, you unenlightened

ANDRE

--Shut up!

MARY

What about my husband? Did you kill

him, too?

HARRY

Husband? What husband?

LLOYD

Mary's married, Harry.

ANDRE

No need to worry about Melvin.

(beat)

Now this is the last time I'll ask:

Who wants to die first?

HARRY

Kill her. The bitch should've told

him she was married back at the

airport. It would've saved us a lot

of trouble.

LLOYD

No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the

one who got you into this mess.

HARRY

No, wait, do me first. I'm the one

who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve

it.

115.

LLOYD

Jesus Christ! You killed my best

friend, you bastard!

ANDRE

If it's any consolation, you're about

to be reunited.

LLOYD

Harry! You're alive!

COP #1

Get your hands up, asshole!

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Special Officer Kathryn Frick. Federal

Bureau of Investigation.

LLOYD

(dumbstruck)

You gotta be kidding.

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Good work, Harry.

116.

HARRY

She grabbed me down in the lobby and

explained what was up. They slapped

this on me and gave me a gun.

LLOYD

(to Athletic Beauty)

But how did you...?

ATHLETIC   BEAUTY

We've been following   you two all the

way from Providence.   Mr. and Mrs.

Swanson had a homing   device plated

in the briefcase.

HARRY

Yeah, about that dough...

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Every bill was counterfeit and marked.

CUT TO:

LLOYD

She's something, ain't she, Har?

HARRY

You were right, Lloyd. She was

efinitely worth the trip.

LLOYD

Guess we have to admit it, she was

too good for us.

MELVIN

Oh god, baby, I missed you!

117.

MELVIN (CONT'D)

I can't thank you enough, fellas. It

was so darn dank in that well, I

really thought it would be the death

of me.

DISSOLVE TO:

HARRY

Hey, Barney...

BELL CAPTAIN

Yes, gentlemen?

LLOYD

Look, we just wanted to say that we

appreciate all you did for us during

our stay.

HARRY

And we're, um, sorry about the money

we gave you turning out to be phony.

BELL CAPTAIN

Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The

Swanson family has promised to

reimburse everyone.

LLOYD

Well, anyway, thanks again for

everything.

BARNARD

Where are you two headed?

118.

HARRY

I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer

camp somewhere to call home.

BARNARD

Why not right here?

LLOYD

This joint is a little out of our

budget, Barney.

BARNARD

(smiling)

Oh, I think we might be able to find

you a free room somewhere -- after

all, like you once told me, we're

all from the same mold.

(winks)

You just don't have any dough right

now.

HARRY

Are you on the level?

BARNARD

Absolutely. We'll just slide you

into one of the employee rooms...

BARNARD (CONT'D)

...Provided, of course, you don't

mind working one or two afternoons a

week.

LLOYD

You know what, Barney, I think we'll

take out chances down the road.

119.

HARRY

(v.o.)

Since we're finished elbow-rubbing,

what next, lloyd?

LLOYD

(v.o.)

I say we head due south and try a

little nose-rubbing with some of

them slinky eskimo babes.

HARRY

(v.o.)

Now you're talking my language. You

know I got a weakness for blondes.
