NARRATOR (V.O)

In between the years when the

oceans drank Atlantis and the rise

of the Sons of Aryas, there was an

age undreamed of, when shining

kingdoms lay spread across the

world like blue mantles under the

stars. Hither came Conan, the

Cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a

king born of battle.

UNBORN BABY

CORIN

Islene!!!

AESIR

Now, now little whore. Did I get

you or your little one?

2.

ISLENE

I'd ask you the same.

ISLENE (CONT'D)

Take your child.

CORIN

I cannot.

ISLENE

There is no time, husband. I would

see my child's face.

ISLENE (CONT'D)

A boy. He will be strong. A warrior

with no equal.

CORIN

Do not speak, love.

ISLENE

You have never been able to still

my tongue, and you will not this

day. He will be wild, Corin. You

must temper him.

3.

ISLENE (CONT'D)

(FADING)

Conan. His--name--is--Conan.

CONAN

CUT TO:

URAN

A Cimmerian warrior is like any

other man. A Cimmerian warrior

feels hunger. He feels cold. Like

other men he may lie and cheat.

(stares the boys down)

But when a Cimmerian warrior

hungers, he hungers only for the

blood of his enemy. When he feels

cold, it is the cold steel of his

sword. When he lies, he lies in

wait for his enemy. And when he

cheats, he cheats death itself!

URAN (CONT'D)

Conan! You are too young to be

here. Withdraw.

LARGEST TEEN

He said leave, motherless whelp.

4.

URAN

In the black crag in the high pass

stands a wooden training sword. The

one who claims it, with stone still

in his mouth, will have earned the

right to train with the warriors.

URAN (CONT'D)

Well? What are you waiting for?!

CLIFF FACE

5.

CIMMERIAN BOY

Conan! Run!

CUT TO:

LATER

CORIN

Conan? Conan?!

CORIN (CONT'D)

What have you done, boy?

CONAN

They killed one. I killed three. I

am a warrior now.

6.

CORIN

A warrior? What you have done a

jackal would do. Never a warrior.

CONAN

They would have done the same --

CORIN

As I said, jackals.

(TO URAN)

He is not ready. I will forge him

myself.

CUT TO:

TRAINING MONTAGE:

CORIN

Stoke your fire, boy.

CONAN

"Stoke your fire, chop your wood."

I have slept where wolves dare not.

I have balanced a thousand river

stones. When will you teach me the

sword?

7.

CORIN

Think you're ready? Then tell me:

what is a sword's purpose?

CONAN

To slay ones enemies.

CORIN

No. That is what it does. Its

purpose is why you use it.

CORIN (CONT'D)

Tell me, which makes the best

sword?

CORIN (CONT'D)

The stronger ore, eh? Then we shall

make a sword of it, and tomorrow

you will show me what brute

strength yields.

CUT TO:

CONAN

Why did it break?

8.

CORIN

Because it had no life.

CUT TO:

CORIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

The strongest blade isn't made of

the hardest steel, boy. The hardest

ore is what a man will die for. It

is strong and unyielding. It

neither cowers nor concedes. But

without the softer ore, it can be

shattered like glass.

CUT TO:

CORIN (CONT'D)

The softer ore is what a man lives

for. It is flexible and lasting. It

survives, even against the greatest

of foes. But too much of the soft

ore, the blade will not cut deep

enough when it must.

CUT TO:

CORIN (CONT'D)

A sword must be tempered, the two

ores united through fire and ice.

Through its suffering the sword

comes to hold both life and death.

CORIN (CONT'D)

Now tell me, what is this sword's

purpose?

CORIN (CONT'D)

This one is not ready yet.

9.

CIMMERIAN SENTRY

See something?

10.

UKAFA

That's the last of their guard

towers.

LUCIUS

All this sneaking around for a

lowly tribe of barbarians.

KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)

This lowly tribe of barbarians have

buried every warrior ever to set

foot on this land, Lucius.

LUCIUS

That is only because they have

never faced my legion.

KHALAR SINGH

Then show us. But should you fail,

remember the plan.

CORIN

Conan?

11.

LUCIUS

Retreat!

CORIN

Wait! Hold your ground!

URAN

Death is in the air, invaders. Can

you taste it?

LUCIUS

(SMILES)

Indeed. I savor it.

12.

CONAN

CHARGE --

13.

CONAN

Father!

CORIN

Come.

CONAN

Do we need more weapons?

CORIN

Go. There is a hunting lodge in the

North Pass with provisions.

CONAN

No! I will fight!

CORIN

This fight is over, but yours has

just begun. You wanted to be a

warrior of the tribe, Conan--now

you must be its last.

CONAN

Father, I am not afraid to die.

CORIN

Good. Make your death have purpose.

14.

CONAN

No!

KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)

I said I wanted a word with him.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

As promised.

PICT

(strange dialect -

SUBTITLED)

Their heads. You promised me their

heads.

KHALAR SINGH

All you wish, once we are gone.

15.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

I take no pleasure in this day,

barbarian. Your people are fierce

warriors, deserving of every story

told of them. But now you must

choose the story for yourself. I am

Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked

from the best Hyboria. My second,

Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo

and his Shadow Scouts from the

jungles of Zingara. And countless

others. They all had a day like

this one. They all chose a way

forward.

CORIN

What is it you want?

KHALAR SINGH

I seek neither gold nor steel, but

flesh and blood. The last of a

royal line that goes back three

thousand years.

CORIN

Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each

man is free here.

KHALAR SINGH

But I seek a woman.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

A queen in hiding. Point her out

and you'll spare the lives of your

own. Perhaps even your wife?

CORIN

My wife was killed, long ago, by

swine such as you.

16.

KHALAR SINGH

Then our stories began in the same

place, Cimmerian. I too lost my

wife to marauders. How many men, in

how many lands have suffered so?

The only answer is power, strength

unfettered, the kind of which can

unite all Hyboria under a single

crown. That is the legacy I seek.

Will you join me?

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

Very well. Then death will be your

story. Your men will die. And your

women too, when I am done with

them. None will survive to carry

your name forth, and over time,

even your enemies will forget you

ever were. You will be wiped from

the pages of history.

(to his men)

Take your blood, but leave the

kill.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

Fariq! Come!

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

Before you lies our enemy. His

tribe waits for him in the beyond.

What would you do?

17.

FARIQ

I would cut out his eyes, father,

so that he will not find them. So

he will wander the afterlife

forever.

KHALAR SINGH

Show me your strength, Fariq.

Without it, you will never rule.

With it, you will never be

forgotten.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

You have your desire. Death has

found you.

CORIN

Soon -- it comes for you.

CONAN'S POV

KHALAR SINGH

Burn this place. It no longer

exists.

18.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE PICT

DISSOLVE TO:

NOTCHED ARM

BARKEEP

He's back there.

19.

CITY GUARD #1

What's this one done?

BARKEEP

What's he done?! What hasn't he

done? He's bedded six of my whores

and finished off three casks of

mead--and he hasn't paid so much as

a silver piece for it.

CITY GUARD #1

So have your men deal with him.

BARKEEP

I did.

CITY GUARD #2

Sounds like a real problem. Too bad

we have other places to be right

now.

BARKEEP

Just get that behemoth out of here.

DRUNKEN MAN

Piss-water! You'll serve my friends

and I your best, barman, or you'll

taste steel!

CITY GUARD #1

Time to leave, northerner.

20.

CONAN

CONAN

No, my small friends. It's time to

die. Now--

CONAN (CONT'D)

Who's first --

CUT TO:

CITY GUARD #1

(STRUGGLING)

By the gods, he's as heavy as a

horse.

CITY GUARD #2

Even a dead horse smells better

than this.

21.

LIEUTENANT

What's the charge?

CITY GUARD #2

Public drunkenness. Another damn

hill ape who can't handle his

liquor.

LIEUTENANT

Is that so, boy? How do you plead?

CONAN

Where's the Captain of the Guard?

LIEUTENANT

In the cells, interrogating a

prisoner. And you'll get the same

if you don't answer. You're accused

of public drunkenness. How do you

plead?

CONAN

In truth, I've been guilty of much.

Jewels stolen from the crowns of

kings, men's heads split in battle

for the price of a night's drink.

But through that I've searched and

waited and hunted my prey.

CONAN (CONT'D)

But drink? Haven't had a drop all

night.

CONAN (CONT'D)

The key to the cells.

22.

LIEUTENANT

I don't have it. There's a guard

inside the door. Only he can open

it.

LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)

You can't kill me! He'll only open

the door for me!

CUT TO:

GUARD #1

What is it?

MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)

Need to see the Captain.

GUARD #1

Fine, fine.

LUCIUS

Men!

23.

LUCIUS (CONT'D)

You've made a huge mistake, ape.

You'll never make it out of this

place.

CONAN

I came for you, Lucius.

LUCIUS

You talk as though you know me,

ape.

CONAN

I do. And I am no ape. I am

Cimmerian.

24.

CUT TO:

LUCIUS

What do you want? Who are you?

CONAN

I'm the one who made you pretty.

LUCIUS

Impossible! You're dead!

CONAN

No. I am death. And I came a long

way for you.

LUCIUS

Wait!! Wait!!

(CONAN PAUSES)

I can tell you where the rest are.

CONAN

Where?

LUCIUS

The end of the earth. You kill me,

and you'll never find them.

25.

CONAN

Who are you offering?

LUCIUS

Who do you think? All of them.

Ukafa, Remo, Cheren, Akhun -- and

Khalar Singh himself. But you have

to swear you won't kill me.

CONAN

You have my word. You tell me where

I will find Khalar Singh, and I

will not kill you.

LUCIUS

He is in a city called on the edge

of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of

Hyboria. Khor Khalba.

LUCIUS (CONT'D)

You gave your word!

LUCIUS (CONT'D)

What are you doing?!

CONAN

Toasting, to our deal.

CONAN (CONT'D)

Go. You are free.

ONE-EYED PRISONER

I won't get far like this.

26.

CONAN

The key to your shackles sits in

the Captain's gut. Happy hunting.

LUCIUS

Barbarian! I had your word! You

said you would spare my life!

CONAN

No. I said I wouldn't kill you.

CUT TO:

UKAFA

Khalar Singh, we've lost half our

cavalry legion, and still Fariq

presses on! We must turn back!

KHALAR SINGH

He says the Queen is here.

UKAFA

He leads us in circles. He knows

nothing of leading an army --

KHALAR SINGH

Take care, Ukafa. You hold a

special place in my kingdom, but

blood you are not.

UKAFA

My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am

simply concerned for your army.

27.

KHALAR SINGH

And I would gladly sacrifice every

last man to get my hands on the

Queen. And in that respect, Fariq

has my confidence. He knows more of

the legends of Acheron than anyone.

FARIQ

Father, they are here! The hidden

oasis, just as it was written.

28.

TAMARA

Stop it! I'm trying to pray!

ILIRA

I'm bored.

TAMARA

Then hit yourself.

TUSSLE--

FASSIR (O.S.)

Is that how one shows penitence?

FASSIR (CONT'D)

I expect more from a queen.

ILIRA

I'm sorry, Fassir. I just tire of

saying the same prayer every day.

FASSIR

Then you should be able to

translate it from its original

Acheronian.

TAMARA

Of course she can. She even taught

it to me. "Never again."

FASSIR

Go on.

TAMARA

Never again will we stand by as

darkness consumes the world. Never

again will innocents suffer for

others' power. Never again will the

Queen suffer so Acheron may rise.

29.

FASSIR

Very good, Tamara. You must have

taught her very well indeed, Ilira.

CHAOS

FASSIR (CONT'D)

The Queen must not be captured.

Take her out the North Gate.

Quickly!

ILIRA

We can't leave them.

TAMARA

If you are caught, everything we

live for is lost!

30.

REMO

No swords. Khalar needs them alive.

TAMARA

Good to know.

REMO

The north gate. Destroy it.

31.

TAMARA

Run!

ILIRA

We'll die!

TAMARA

We'll die if we stay!

TAMARA

NO!!!

KHALAR SINGH

Who was guarding that gate?

REMO

It was I, Lord.

32.

KHALAR SINGH

Take four legions. Hunt her. Before

I hunt you.

CUT TO:

SLAVER CARAVAN

TAMARA

Water -- please --

HEAD SLAVER

The gods are good.

(to the other slavers)

Chain this one in my cage. She'll

be the prize of the auction in Khor

Kalba.

CUT TO:

33.

KHALAR SINGH

All these years searching the ends

of the earth. And here you are.

Just a two day ride from Khor

Kalba. I can scarcely believe it.

FASSIR

(in Acheronian, to monks)

Say nothing.

KHALAR SINGH

(IN ACHERONIAN)

Yes. Say nothing. Maybe he doesn't

know who we are. Maybe he's not

looking for the Queen.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

That's right, my brethren, you have

been lied to all your lives. Told

you must hide yourselves, told you

were alone. I want you to look at

me, and see me for what I am. A

brother. A friend. I have come not

to hurt you, but liberate you.

FASSIR

You come for your own dark

purposes, to raise Acheron.

KHALAR SINGH

Yes. I come to resurrect the

greatest empire Hyboria has ever

known.

FASSIR

An empire of evil, soaked in blood

sacrifice and the blackest of

magic.

KHALAR SINGH

Have you hidden from the world so

long that you cannot to see? Blood,

magic, death: it is everywhere.

Acheron is no different than any

other kingdom, but for its glory.

(MORE)

34.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

And in place of that glory, you

offer shame? I knew shame, but that

was before I was shown my true

lineage.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

When I was but a child, raiders

destroyed my village, cut our

fathers to ribbons, and burned our

women as sacrifice to foreign gods.

Those few who survived, we ran for

our lives, chased into caves at the

edge of the Eastern Sea, left with

nothing to live for. But then we

discovered it. Acheron. The temple

that spawned an empire. We learned

that we were not broken goat-

herders on a desolate coastline. We

were the sons and daughters of

kings.

(stares in Ilira's eyes)

And queens.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

For thirty years I have searched

for you. In that time I built both

an army and empire, but they are

nothing compared to what we can

create together. We can raise

Acheron again. Never again will we

hide like rats. Never again will we

watch as our loved ones are

slaughtered. I call forth the

Queen. Stand and join me, and this

day will have a joyous end.

FASSIR

You would have all the world

suffer, as you have suffered. We

will die before we help you.

KHALAR SINGH

Yes. You will.

35.

FARIQ

The caves beneath Khor Khalba

contain all manner of creature,

many -- altered -- by centuries of

blood magic. But one, in

particular, has developed a special

connection to the blood. A thirst.

It is said that only the Queen of

Acheron itself can resist its

embrace.

FARIQ (CONT'D)

So what say you? Will you be the

lucky one, or will you tell me who

is?

CUT TO:

TAMARA

SLAVE TRADER

Wake up, slags! Smile! A new owner

approaches!

TAMARA

Let me go. I promise you'll be

rewarded.

SLAVE TRADER

And I would sample that reward,

fair one, but you wear white.

(MORE)

36.

SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)

Tell me, have the stars aligned and

delivered a virgin slave into my

care?

SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)

No matter. I'll know soon enough.

(TURNS AWAY)

Good day, sir! A lone rider in a

desolate land. The perfect customer

for what I sell.

CONAN

SHEMISH WOMAN

Please, master! Your gold can free

me from this hole! I can bring you

PLEASURE--

SLAVE TRADER

Silence whore!

CONAN

Khor Kalba. Which way?

SLAVE TRADER

This is the road to Khor Kalba.

Ahead. Past the Great Wall.

ENORMOUS BOULDERS

37.

CONAN

Use your whips on the horses' legs!

TURANIAN HORSEMEN

CONAN

38.

REMO

CONAN (CONT'D)

You!

CONAN

REMO

The girl! Bring her to Khalar!

39.

CUT TO:

TAMARA

CONAN

Who are you?

TAMARA

I am nobody.

CONAN

Many died to capture nobody.

(motions to his horse)

Get up.

TAMARA

And if I don't wish to ride with

you?

TAMARA

Stop! I want water.

CONAN

Perhaps the slavers took your

orders. I don't.

40.

TAMARA

I never knew men could be so cruel.

Now I wonder if the world is filled

with animals such as you.

CONAN

You speak of animals as if they

were less than men. But animals

don't stab their brothers in the

back or steal their mother's only

possession. And they never lie.

TAMARA

I haven't lied.

CONAN

Very well. Give me your name.

TAMARA

I am Tamara Amelia Karushan. And

you?

CONAN

I am Conan.

TAMARA

Conan? That's it?

CONAN

What more names do I need?

CONAN (CONT'D)

There is only one truth I need from

you, Tamara Amelia Karushan. Why

does Khalar Singh want you?

CONAN (CONT'D)

Then let's hope it's for your

cooking.

41.

CONAN

Trying to poison me?

CONAN (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

TAMARA

Before we eat, I must pray.

CONAN

Crom! What would you pray for? That

a bone may not get stuck in your

throat? No words nor gods will give

you one more moment than fate

allows you.

TAMARA

Then you have no faith. And I am

sorry for you.

CONAN

I need no pity.

TAMARA

But you do. You live in a world

that is harsh and short. Where fate

is unyielding and hope is a cruel

joke. I live in a world with a

purpose that guides me, where faith

sustains me.

TAMARA (CONT'D)

Why did you--

42.

CONAN

Don't worry. His back is broken. He

won't be slinking away this time.

CONAN (CONT'D)

Now, let's eat.

TAMARA

But -- what about him?!

CONAN

I enjoy a little music with my

meal.

DISSOLVE TO:

BENEATH IT--

ACHERONIAN WARRIORS

43.

ACHERONIAN PYRAMID

CUT TO:

44.

REMO

Please! Mercy!

CONAN

You are more fit to inflict torture

than to endure it. Your life is not

nailed to your spine as my peoples

are.

REMO

Stop! Stop! I know how make you

rich! Rich! You hear name Khalar

Singh? You have what he want. The

girl, yes? Khalar give you anything

for her. More!

CONAN

Why would he?

REMO

She could be the one.

CONAN

One what?

REMO

The one. The Queen.

CONAN

A queen in hiding.

REMO

Yes! Yes! I sent to find her. Bring

her. He wait for me now, at Great

Wall. He pay you anything. More!

45.

CONAN

So I should ransom her to your

master? Not exactly loyal -- but

still, a good idea.

CONAN (CONT'D)

You'll help me deliver it.

REMO

Please! Please! I help you! I do

anything you wish!

CONAN

Good. Die.

CUT TO:

46.

KHALAR

KHALAR SINGH

He brought a message?

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

Gold, for the girl. A ransom, for

me to deliver in person.

UKAFA

I'll find them -- and come back

with their heads.

FARIQ

You let the girl escape once,

Ukafa. What makes you think you can

do better now?

UKAFA

I did what?

FARIQ

I found the monastery. It was my

understanding that you were in

charge of its capture --

KHALAR SINGH

Enough! We will take no chances. We

will pay this thief what he wants,

and more.

TAMARA

47.

CONAN

Here. Eat.

TAMARA

Couldn't you at least cook it

first?

CONAN

Fire draws attention.

TAMARA

Does it bother you, blood on your

hands?

CONAN

The only blood on these hands I

claimed with my own sword.

TAMARA

What does that mean?

CONAN

Clean hands mean nothing. Kings and

Queens claim more lives than I will

ever meet, and not a drop is

spilled in their presence.

TAMARA

What are you talking about? I've

done no harm to you. I've done no

harm to anyone.

CONAN

You lie. You are the very reason my

people are dead.

TAMARA

Are you mad? I never met your

people.

CONAN

But Khalar Singh has. He destroyed

my people, looking for you.

48.

TAMARA

The one who came for us? His name

is Khalar Singh?

CONAN

You know this.

TAMARA

We did not know who sought us, only

that we were sought.

CONAN

You hid from him. And while you

did, others died in your place.

TAMARA

If we did not hide, countless more

would have been killed! You do not

know what purpose he has for our

queen.

CONAN

And I do not care, for he will not

live to see it bear fruit!

TAMARA

Wait -- you seek to kill this

Khalar? We have the same aim. He

takes my queen to Khor Kalba. I

have sworn an oath to protect her.

I can help you.

CONAN

Enough lies.

CONAN

You will keep quiet.

49.

TAMARA

What use is talking? You won't

believe a word I speak. I only want

to know this -- how will you kill

Khalar? You are too big to play the

assassin.

CONAN

You will be the lure that will draw

me close. Then I will scale the

wall and cut him down where he

stands.

TAMARA

And the archers and cavalry? They

will be napping?

CONAN

They will not be a problem.

TAMARA

No. Not good enough.

CONAN

Did I ask?

TAMARA

Should you fail, I'll be left

without a weapon, helpless in my

enemies hands. Let me help, Conan.

CONAN

I will not fail.

DISSOLVE TO:

FARIQ

Let me take care of this thief,

father. He's beneath your notice.

50.

KHALAR SINGH

He killed Remo, likely his cavalry

legion as well. Whatever he is, he

is more than a mere thief.

CONAN

Be still!

CONAN (CONT'D)

(yelling to Khalar)

I have what you want! Where's my

gold?!

KHALAR

KHALAR SINGH

(YELLING BACK)

Triple your price. Come and claim

it.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

Send her to me.

CONAN

Send the gold.

51.

KHALAR

KHALAR SINGH

You're fast. But are you fast

enough?

REACHES

52.

WALL WALK

FARIQ

FARIQ

You should have run, while you

could.

KHALAR SINGH

Fariq!

CONAN

I was wondering what it would take

for you to stop cowering.

KHALAR SINGH

I wasn't cowering. I was studying.

You're quite gifted with a sword,

but it's not from schooling. Your

speed and power makes up for a lack

of -- finesse. I've seen such

fighting before -- Cimmerian.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

Cimmerian it is. Now it makes

sense. You came for blood, not

gold.

53.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

Your people barely afforded me a

challenge. You're little more than

beasts.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

You've come a long way, barbarian,

only to fail.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

So much for vengeance.

(to his soldiers)

Get me oil -- and a torch.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

Is that really the best you could

do? Is that as far as you could

think ahead? Just rush in and kill

me?

54.

TAMARA' HANDS

CHEREN

No!!

EXPLOSION

KHALAR SINGH

KHALAR SINGH

Ukafa, you will take half our

forces North, to the Sea. I will

take the rest South.

FARIQ

What of me, father?

55.

KHALAR SINGH

You will return to Khor Kalba. You

will feed the women to the beast

until you find our Queen.

FARIQ

I will not. I will track the

barbarian with you --

KHALAR SINGH

You think I care what you wish?!

You want to play warrior? It is not

in you. One day you will be king,

but warlord, never.

FARIQ

I can. Let me prove it to you!

KHALAR SINGH

You will not risk your life again.

You are my line, my successor. You

will not throw away all that I have

worked for.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

(without looking at Ukafa)

If I find you smiling before you

bring me the girl, I will take

every tooth I see.

CUT TO:

CORIN (O.S.)

More wood boy! We must test the

steel with our fire.

OUT LOGS--

56.

CORIN (CONT'D)

What are you waiting for? The fire

is dying.

CONAN

It's not enough. I've failed you

father.

CORIN

It will never be enough, Conan.

CONAN

I don't understand --

CORIN

Through suffering, you will learn

your purpose, boy. And you have not

begun to suffer yet.

TAMARA

I wouldn't move so fast. I bound

your wounds as best I could, but

I'm no healer.

57.

CONAN

Where am I?

TAMARA

On the Wasp. You told me where it

laid, just before you passed out.

Though I can't say as I feel much

safer here.

TAMARA (CONT'D)

Don't embarrass me with thanks, I

only saved your life.

CONAN

You were -- adequate.

ARTUS

Look what we have here. A hill ape

in over his head.

CONAN

I was just wondering what that

smell was.

(sniffs near Artus)

Now I know.

ARTUS

We take no stowaways. Only paying

passengers. You've best be laden

with gold.

CONAN

If it's metal you seek, perhaps

you'd settle for steel.

58.

CONAN (CONT'D)

Still fast Artus.

ARTUS

Fast, deadly, charming, rakishly

handsome.

(to the pirates)

All hail Conan!

PIRATES

All hail Conan!

ARTUS

Sorry, friend. Looks like you've

had a rough road.

CONAN

It won't get easier. Khalar Singh

lives. He'll be coming for me and

the girl.

ARTUS

Good. We're scrapping for a fight

these days.

CONAN

This one may be more than you wish.

I need you to get me close to Khor

Kalba.

ARTUS

Rest up. We'll get you there.

TAMARA

We go to Khor Kalba?

CONAN

I do.

59.

TAMARA

No. We do.

CONAN

Just leave me to sleep.

CONAN (CONT'D)

You would risk your life for

royalty? Why?

TAMARA

Because she represent freedom, not

just ours but all Hyboria's. What

do you know of Acheron?

CONAN

A tall tale. Meant to scare

children.

TAMARA

It is no fable. It's my people's

history. Acheron was an empire that

swallowed all of Hyboria, led by

the King and his legion of demon

warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable.

Immortal. But still it had one

weakness. For the true power of

Acheron laid not with its King, but

the Queen. Every twenty years, a

new queen from the royal line would

be coronated with a crown of iron.

Spikes would pierce her, slowly

drain her precious blood, and

through her suffering Acheron would

remain invincible. Until one of my

ancestors, an Acheronian himself,

put a stop to this tyranny. He and

others spirited the new Queen away,

hiding her from the empire and all

those who would raise it again.

CONAN

What care I for queens and empires?

60.

TAMARA

Didn't you hear me? This evil faces

us all. All of civilization will

fall if the army of Acheron is

raised again.

CONAN

I heard. Only I would happily put

all of your "civilization" to the

torch myself.

TAMARA

But -- you owe me a debt, you

thankless oaf!

CONAN

My only debt is to my people. And

it still lies unpaid.

SAILOR

It was a pirate ship. They left as

soon as the girl and the large one

boarded.

KHALAR SINGH

Which way did they sail?

SAILOR

North.

KHALAR SINGH

Are you certain?

SAILOR

Yes, please, I'm telling you the

truth!

61.

KHALAR SINGH

Send word to Ukafa. They come to

him by sea.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

Find me a warship.

CUT TO:

ARTUS

Try not to taste it going down

would be my advice.

TAMARA

You've known Conan long?

ARTUS

We sailed with him for a while. I

would like to say I know the man.

TAMARA

He is a riddle to me.

ARTUS

Aye, he's that too.

TAMARA

We have the same goal. Why will he

not trust me?

ARTUS

Why would he? He's a stranger in

every land he trods. A man with no

home, no people, none but the

company of ghosts. And he bears the

weight of their deaths every moment

of every day.

TAMARA

That is no way to live.

62.

ARTUS

He doesn't live. I've seen in him

great mirth, only to watch it

smothered by greater melancholy. He

owes a blood debt, and he can

entertain no other joy, no other

cause, until it is fulfilled.

TAMARA

And yet you call him friend, and

risk death to help him.

ARTUS

Let me tell you something of Conan.

He will never lie. He will never

break a trust, once given. And he

will never, ever give up.

TAMARA

He's a stubborn ass.

ARTUS

He is that, lass. He is that.

CUT TO:

FARIQ

Here we stand again. Will the queen

reveal herself, or must another

innocent suffer?

FARIQ (CONT'D)

My father, he tires of your

charade. He grows impatient. But I

have no such haste. I enjoy

watching you squirm.

63.

FARIQ (CONT'D)

Perhaps you'd like to see the end

your sisters faced back at the

monastery?

ACHERONIAN BOX

FARIQ (CONT'D)

No? Your fear is not enough yet?

Let's try harder.

FARIQ (CONT'D)

I've read all there is to know of

mighty Acheron. Why would true

Acheronians protect a traitor to

their own? You once held the entire

world in your grasp, now you hide

and cower like pitiful mice.

FARIQ (CONT'D)

And mice are meant to be swallowed

whole.

FARIQ (CONT'D)

What was in the box could only

drink from you one at a time. But

the beast of Acheron, it will claim

four of you this night.

(MORE)

64.

FARIQ (CONT'D)

Who will spare the rest and tell me

which of you is the queen?

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

I am here, swine.

FEMALE MONK

I am the one you seek.

FARIQ

At last. Some bravery. But of

course, you wouldn't expect me to

take your word, would you?

CUT TO:

TAMARA

No!!!

CONAN (O.S.)

I hope I awoke with less clamor.

TAMARA

You're drinking? You were near

death this time yesterday.

65.

CONAN

Is there a better reason to drink?

TAMARA

Do you think--I could try some of

that? I'm curious of its taste.

CONAN

You've never tasted mead?

TAMARA

It's good.

TAMARA (CONT'D)

Let me ask you something. Once

you've killed Khalar and claimed

your vengeance, then what? You will

be free from your ghosts. What of

your future, Conan?

CONAN

I have no future. It died with my

people, as I should have.

TAMARA

So your life is penance? For what,

for living? And when you too die,

what do you believe happens then?

CONAN

Nothing.

TAMARA

Nothing? I couldn't live without

some kind of belief in the world

after this.

CONAN

I believe in the cold of steel, the

warmth of flesh. All else is fairy

tales.

66.

TAMARA

Perhaps. But I still die with faith

in my heart, belief in something

greater than one's self. What will

you die with?

CONAN

Purpose. I die with purpose.

DISSOLVE TO:

TAMARA'S POV

PIRATE 1

To stations! To stations!

BLACK WARSHIP

THE GALLEY

ARTUS

What do you think? They have us

outnumbered, but we might beat

their speed.

67.

CONAN

That is what they wish. They drive

us to another force, approaching

from the south.

ARTUS

Then we fight?

CONAN

No. We give them what they think

they want.

(to the Pirates)

About ship! Now!

THE WARSHIP

CAPTAIN

They're turning to run.

UKAFA

Good. We only need stay close.

THE GALLEY

ARTUS

And now?

CONAN

Let us show them why she is called

the Wasp.

TAMARA

Why is she called the Wasp?

ARTUS

Open astern! Load the stinger!

68.

CAPTAIN

They are doing -- something.

CONAN

Fire!

CONAN (CONT'D)

Rip her apart!

WARSHIP

SAILOR

We're taking on water!

Hard to port!

UKAFA

No. Let them fire again!

We will sink.

So be it.

(to his spearmen)

Get below. Be ready.

CONAN

Fire!

UKAFA

Now!

Bring her back!

ARTUS (CONT'D)

She's dead in the water!

CONAN (CONT'D)

Hide her below.

CONAN

UKAFA (CONT'D)

We are each the last of our tribe,

Cimmerian. Yours dies this day.

71.

UKAFA (CONT'D)

Your head will top my spear today,

but know Khalar's pig son will soon

share your fate.

UKAFA (CONT'D)

Now finally, you die.

TAMARA

CONAN

Time to go.

72.

ARTUS

I could get you closer. Another

half day along the coast --

CONAN

I need you head west, to draw off

our pursuers. I'll find another

path to Khor Kalba.

ARTUS

So be it. Swift wind at your backs.

TAMARA

So you are taking me with you to

Khor Kalba.

CONAN

I never said that. But I won't

leave a virgin onboard a pirate

ship, alone.

TAMARA

I -- but -- who said I was a

virgin?

CONAN

We'll rest here until morning.

73.

TAMARA

Will I awake alone? Do you intend

to leave me?

CONAN

I would do you a kindness. Khor

Kalba will bring only death.

TAMARA

Please, Conan. Artus told me of how

you lost your tribe. I too had to

watch as my people were taken from

me.

TAMARA (CONT'D)

All I ask is that you let me travel

with you. I too have a purpose. I

must get to the queen. I would

rather you kill me here, than fail

her again.

TAMARA (CONT'D)

I was wrong about you. You are no

fearless warrior. Your heart is

closed to all but fear -- and hate.

CONAN

We leave at dawn. I will not break

stride for you. Not once. I will

get you into Khor Kalba. Beyond

that I have my purpose, and you

yours.

TAMARA

Nice fire. Does it mean you'll

actually cook the meat this time?

CUT TO:

74.

CAPTAIN

The pirate ship sailed to the west.

Even under full sail it'll be no

easy task to overtake her.

KHALAR SINGH

Fariq has done well.

(to the Captain)

Head east, back to Khor Kalba.

CAPTAIN

But our chase points the other way.

KHALAR SINGH

The chase is over. They come to me

now.

A BOAR

CONAN

75.

TAMARA

What were the women of your tribe

like, Conan?

CONAN

They fought beside the men.

TAMARA

So they were equals. And your

mother?

CONAN

She died in battle, even as I was

born.

TAMARA

So you never knew her. It was the

same with me. I've always known

being a mother was somehow not my

fate. But--

TAMARA (CONT'D)

You said earlier Khor Kalba will

bring only death. Were you trying

to scare me, or do you really

believe our end lies there?

CONAN

I don't lie.

TAMARA

Then we don't have much time. Your

mother perished too young, but at

least she died having known the

touch of one who cared.

TAMARA (CONT'D)

So -- do you care, Conan?

76.

LOVE SCENE

AFTERMATH

TAMARA (CONT'D)

I've only ever heard you speak of

what you'd die for, Conan. What

would you live for?

CONAN

Do you ever tire of talking? Let me

rest, woman.

TAMARA

I thought that may work.

TAMARA (CONT'D)

I see you clearly now, finally,

after all this time.

(she kisses him deeply)

I would be that which you live for,

Conan, if you would have me. You

may have faith in nothing, Conan --

but I have faith in you.

DISSOLVE TO:

77.

KHOR KALBA

CONAN

We'll slip in, along with those

traders. But you'll need a change

of clothes, those monks' robes will

draw attention.

TAMARA

What will I wear?

TAMARA

TAMARA

I don't understand why I couldn't

be dressed as you are. I look like

a whore.

CONAN

And what better disguise for a

monk?

78.

CONAN (CONT'D)

Do not test me, beast.

TAMARA

Is there not a living thing you can

be at peace with?

STRANGER

WOODEN PLATFORM

CONAN

It's probably only way into

Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is

heavily guarded at all times, day

and night.

TAMARA

So we must try to scale the cliff.

CONAN

And dodge arrows as we do so?

CONAN (CONT'D)

During the day, we'd easily be

spotted on the climb. And it would

be useless to even attempt at

night. No, we must find another

way.

STRANGER'S POV

79.

ALLEYWAY

VOICE (O.S.)

Halt.

CONAN

Thieves. You'll regret finding me.

VOICE (O.S.)

I think not.

ONE EYED THIEF

It took longer than you think to

cut this out of Lucius' stomach.

After all that work, I figured I'd

keep it -- for old times' sake.

80.

CONAN

What? Do you wish to join in?

CUT TO:

ONE EYED THIEF

--so you were right about the

platform. You'll be long dead

before you make it top. Same with

scaling the cliff. There's no known

way to break into the fortress.

CONAN

So that's it?

ONE EYED THIEF

I didn't say that. I just said

there's no known way in -- because

no one has ever tried to. But

breaking out -- that's another

story. It's not much easier, but

it's possible.

ONE EYED THIEF (CONT'D)

You just need to find someone crazy

enough to show you the way.

ONE EYED THIEF

These catacombs run underneath the

entire city, even to the cistern

that drains out from the fortress

dungeon.

TAMARA

Catacombs? You mean sewers.

ONE EYED THIEF

Piss and shit are the last things

you need to worry about down here.

81.

CONAN

What is it?

TAMARA

A warning. These catacombs are

connected to the sea. It says that

the beasts of Acheron protect its

secrets.

CONAN

Not from me.

ONE EYED THIEF

Sorry, friend. We stop here. We've

heard too much about what lies

within to go any further.

TAMARA

Where now?

CONAN

Around. Up.

CONAN

DEAD WARRIOR

TAMARA

TAMARA

Oh!!!

CONAN

What?

TAMARA

Something touched me. Something

slimy.

CONAN

Crom! Stop wasting time.

CONAN (CONT'D)

Crom indeed.

83.

CONAN (CONT'D)

Let's go.

TAMARA

What is that?

CONAN

Nothing good.

VOICE (O.S.)

Welcome.

AKHUN (CONT'D)

You'll make a nice meal.

87.

CUT TO:

TAMARA

Where is Ilira?

FEMALE MONK

She was taken away by Fariq.

TAMARA

Then I'm too late.

ELDER MONK

No. She was just taken this

morning. It's not yet midnight,

and Khalar still must bring her to

the cave of Acheron.

CONAN

You're going to fight Khalar's

troops? Just you?

TAMARA

Cimmerians aren't the only women

who know how to fight. And to kill.

TAMARA (CONT'D)

Our duty was to keep the queen

safe. We failed. But if Khalar

brings her to Acheron, it will rise

again -- and all our peoples'

sacrifice is for nothing.

(MORE)

88.

TAMARA (CONT'D)

So if the queen is not free by the

stroke of midnight -- she must be

already dead.

CONAN

You want my help again.

TAMARA

No. You kept your word, I'll keep

mine. I pray you fulfill your debt.

ELDER MONK

(WHISPERING)

Guard.

TAMARA

(WHISPERING)

Don't kill him. We need to find out

which way Ilira was taken.

TAMARA

Tell us where the last girl was

taken.

CONAN (O.S.)

Let me ask.

TAMARA

Your debt --

89.

CONAN

Will be where your queen is.

TAMARA

Ilira!

TAMARA (CONT'D)

She's dead. It's over.

VOICE (O.S.)

Not yet.

KHALAR SINGH

It's only begun. Because that one

was not the heir to Acheron.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

She is.

TAMARA

No. It can't be --

KHALAR SINGH

Secretive, the traitors of Acheron.

It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally

wrung honesty from the girl. That

poor innocent was forced to live a

lie, even as the truth was kept

from the queen herself.

(MORE)

90.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

(TO CONAN)

And you did the rest, barbarian. My

thanks for delivering the Queen to

me.

TAMARA

No!

FARIQ

At last you awaken, Cimmerian. It's

been hours you've made me wait for

my fun.

FARIQ (CONT'D)

You made me lose face in front of

my father. That wasn't wise. But

what should I expect from a

Cimmerian?

CONAN

A swift end!

FARIQ

Hardly. But that is a difference

between you and me. A swift end

would be a mercy I do not intend to

grant. No, you must suffer for your

transgressions.

(MORE)

91.

FARIQ (CONT'D)

You must beg for your suffering to

end. Just as your people did.

CONAN

You lie. I was there. My father

never uttered a sound.

FARIQ

You were there? What were you

doing, warrior? Watching your

father die, without saying a sound?

Taking your eyes will be justice

indeed, coward.

CONAN

I saw my father die. Slain by one

who can only kill men already on

their knees.

FARIQ

I've killed many in battle, cur.

CONAN

Really? Then why did your father

not let you face me before, when I

had sword in hand. He thought you

unequal to the task.

CONAN (CONT'D)

Coward! Prove your strength!

CONAN (CONT'D)

Take my eyes, coward -- if you can.

Close the gates and stay here. Send

my son to me when he arrives.

(motioning to two of them)

You two, come with me.

THE ALTAR

KHALAR SINGH

The Acheronians had a wonderful

sense of balance, don't you think?

For one to ascend to royalty,

another must fall.

94.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

For a hundred generations the kings

of Acheron were crowned, and the

queens were sacrificed.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

What a day for you. This morning

you were a handmaiden. Tonight, you

are a queen giving birth to an

empire.

CUT TO:

95.

TAMARA

Stop. You don't know what you are

about to do.

KHALAR SINGH

But I do. For thirty years I have

dreamed of this day. The day our

people rise from the ashes.

KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)

It begins. You give birth to an

empire.

CONAN

Crom.

REVERSE ANGLE

96.

KHALAR SINGH

It's good that you pray. Gods will

be here soon.

TAMARA

He'll--be---here--sooner.

KHALAR SINGH

Who?

CONAN (O.S.)

Me!

KHALAR SINGH

I will say this for you, barbarian.

You are hard to kill.

CONAN

Let her go.

KHALAR SINGH

You've faced me before and lost.

What do you think has changed now?

CONAN

My purpose.

THE ALTAR

KHALAR SINGH

You are strong, Cimmerian, but we

Once you used my father to teach

your son a lesson about strength.

Now let me teach you.
