15   OVER BLACKNESS, we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO. And then a 15

WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until

finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we...

FADE IN:

EXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK

The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,

just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm

water runs down its face and body.

TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the

baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind

her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the

baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:

MIDWIFE

He is strong.

The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out

to the new MOTHER:

AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a

divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly

takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.

She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:

AMANDA

... hello.

CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.

She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:

YOUNGER MIDWIFE

The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?

MIDWIFE

(a beat; then)

She is human.

A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking

into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,

that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.

MIDWIFE (CONT'D)

Sarek arrives.

The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for

a moment, clearly disquieted.

SAREK

Well done.

AMANDA

Thanks.

SAREK

Your tone suggests disappointment. The

Science Council required my presence for

a session regarding--

AMANDA

Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you

here.

SAREK

As you are aware, the Vulcan male is

traditionally not present at the moment

of delivery.

AMANDA

Well traditionally, I'm not the one

giving birth.

AMANDA (CONT'D)

I moved here -- to another planet -- to

be with you. I needed you to be with me

today. Holding my hand and telling me

I'm doing great, even when I'm just...

breathing the best I can.

SAREK

You are correct. I should have been

here. I am sorry.

SAREK (CONT'D)

I had a thought. That we might name the

child after one of our respected early

society-builders. His name was "Spock".

SAREK (CONT'D)

Your silence does not suggest enormous

enthusiasm.

AMANDA

No... Spock.

(smiles, touches his

face)

... Spock.

SAREK

The child has your eyes.

AMANDA

... and your ears.

Who is your commander?

(silence, then re: Nero)

Is it him?

AYEL

You will speak only to me.

CAPTAIN ROBAU

Then ask your commander what right he has

to attack a Federation vessel.

AYEL

That was hardly an attack. My commander

will easily destroy your ship. If you do

not respond to the question.

CAPTAIN ROBAU

I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.

Are you familiar with -- or better, know

the location of -- Ambassador Spock?

LEARNING CENTER -- white "bowls", sunk into the dark ground,

where PROFESSORS walk, hands behind their backs, surveying this

mass "mental martial arts" test.

We're on ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD as she gets an answer wrong -- AND

THE LIGHT OVER HER BOWL GOES OUT. Then ANOTHER CHILD -- who

gets an answer wrong -- and HIS LIGHT GOES OUT. An EXTREMELY

WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT reveals BOWL AFTER BOWL as the LIGHTS GO OUT.

Until only one bowl remains. Spock's. He finishes his last

question. Gets it right. PUSH IN ON HIM as the COMPUTER SAYS:

COMPUTER VOICE

Your score is one-hundred percent.

Congratulations. Spock.

Off his face, we CUT TO MOMENTS LATER, as Spock collects his

things. As he does, three young VULCAN BULLIES walk up behind

him. Spock glances at them, then back to his things.

YOUNG SPOCK

I presume you've prepared new insults for

today.

VULCAN BULLY #1

Your mother lies with many men.

Spock just NODS.   Tries to ignore the fact that IT STINGS.

YOUNG SPOCK

I have no such information.

VULCAN BULLY #2

You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and

therefore, have no place in the universe.

YOUNG SPOCK

(swallowing that too)

This is your thirty-fifth attempt to

elicit an emotional response from me.

Logic dictates you would cease by now.

VULCAN BULLY #1

Look. He has human eyes. They look sad,

don't they?

VULCAN BULLY #2

Perhaps an emotional response requires

physical stimuli.

And Bully #2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling

into one of the bowls. He looks up as:

VULCAN BULLY #2 (CONT'D)

He's a traitor, you know. Your father.

For marrying her.

Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable --

AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL! They

land inside -- Spock cries, flailing as he punches Bully #2!

The other two stand atop the bowl, stunned -- shocked -- unsure

what the hell to do -- and we CUT TO:

21

46   INT. LEARNING CENTER - CORRIDOR - LATER                             46

TIGHT ON Spock, chastened, sitting glumly on a bench. A massive

VULCAN CITY seen through the window behind him. His parents

ARGUE at a distance down the hall:

AMANDA                                SAREK

-- where I'm from, when

someone hits you, you hit back-

- how is that not logical?         -- Spock had no reasonable

-- They pick on him -- they        expectation of being

tease him -- every day.            physically injured --

-- Which is precisely when

reason must guide his actions

-- I want him to embrace           above all.

Vulcan, you know that... but

he has to be himself-- which

means, occasionally, being         -- His "humanity" is very the

human.                             source of his ostracism.

-- When Vulcans get disgusted

with each other, they never

just walk away, do they?           -- No.

-- Well humans do.

And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns --

sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING

IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in

front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:

YOUNG SPOCK

I did not mean to create conflict between

you and mother.

After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.     No anger in his

face. Takes a seat beside his son...

SAREK

In marriage... conflict is...

YOUNG SPOCK

... constant?

SAREK

Natural.

(a beat)

Emotions run deep within our race. In

many ways, more deeply than in humans.

Long ago, they nearly destroyed us...

that is why we followed the teachings of

Surak. Now you must choose.

YOUNG SPOCK

... between you and mother?

46   CONTINUED:                                                            46

SAREK

Never, my son. But you may choose the

ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity

humans seldom experience. The control of

feelings... so that they do not control

you.

YOUNG SPOCK

They called you a traitor.

(then)

You suggest that I should be completely

Vulcan... and yet you married a human...

why?

Sarek is clearly conflicted by this.      But he holds steady:

SAREK

As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to

observe and understand human behavior.

Marrying your mother... was logical.

(Spock seems disquieted)

Spock. You are fully capable of choosing

your own destiny. The question you are

faced with... is which path you will

take. This is something only you can

decide.

47   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                             47

BAM -- a door opens: 14 year-old GEORGE KIRK, JR. angrily exits

the house, carrying a duffel. His angrier, redneckier UNCLE

FRANK following. 11 year-old JIM KIRK nervously pursues them:

UNCLE FRANK

Go ahead: go-- run away! You know I

could give a damn!

YOUNG KIRK

-- wait-- no!    Where are you going?

GEORGE JR.

Anywhere but here, far as I can get!

UNCLE FRANK

Which won't be far enough -- know what

your problem is?!

(big luggie spit)

No one ever taught you respect! How to

follow orders! Do as you're told!

(to Jim)

-- what the hell are you doing?

YOUNG KIRK

I-- I just don't want my brother to go.

47    CONTINUED:                                                      47

UNCLE FRANK

Well I do-- and I asked you to wash the

car! How many damn times do I need to

repeat myself?! How many damn times?

How many?

YOUNG KIRK

Please stay-- you can have my Flo-Yo!

GEORGE JR.

This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank.

I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no

idea what he's like when she's not here--

d'you hear him talking like he's our

dad?! And that's not even his car you're

washing! That was Dad's car! You know

why you're washing it? Because he's

gonna sell it!

JIM

Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom

when she gets back from Africa.

GEORGE JR.

She's gone for five more months, by then

I'll be in a different system.

(sees fear in Kirk)

You're gonna be okay. You always are.

Always doing everything right -- good

grades and obeying every stupid order...

(then)

I can't be a Kirk in this house. Show me

how to do that and I'll stay.

Jim is now officially LOVING THIS -- and he DRIVES THROUGH a

FENCE -- CRASH! The Cop RACES through it, in the Corvette's

DUST -- and we PUSH IN on a SIGN that reads "DANGER - QUARRY

AHEAD -- IOWA MINING CO." In fact --

52   EXT. QUARRY - CONTINUOUS                                          52

We see the MASSIVE QUARRY -- hundreds of feet deep -- and TILT

UP to the Corvette and Cop speeding toward it --

53   INT. CORVETTE - MOVING - CONTINUOUS                               53

KIRK, EYES INTENSE, ALMOST SUICIDAL -- this is where he's been

headed all along -- and for a moment we think holy shit -- this

is how James Kirk dies. He speeds toward the edge -- CLOSER --

CLOSER -- but at the last second, Kirk SLAMS the brake -- the

car SKIDS -- PIVOTS -- and he LEAPS FROM THE CAR, WHICH SAILS

SIDEWAYS OFF THE CLIFF EDGE -- FALLING... falling... the COP

comes to QUICK a STOP in CLOUDS of DUST as the Corvette EXPLODES

ON THE QUARRY FLOOR --

The angry Cop hops off his hovercruiser, hand on weapon, as Jim

Kirk, out of breath, exhilarated, gets to his knees.

COP

What's your name, son?

And as he stands, we PUSH IN on him -- LOW and WIDE -- damn if

that kid doesn't have a swagger. It's like the first time he's

ever stood in his life.

JIM

My name's Kirk. James Tiberius Kirk.

And as our MUSIC BUILDS we CUT TO:

But I assume we both speak the language

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)

We found this book in your cell.

Cartography, mathematics-- what do these

mean? This date here -- eleven years

from now-- what happens then?

(holds up the

FLUORESCENT MAPS)

And why attempt to smuggle in maps of

Federation space?

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)

When you were captured we assumed you

were a spy, sent from Romulus to surveil

the Empire. But because the Romulans

deny your existence, I believe you are

much more than that.

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)

Your ship remains in orbit above us now.

We've been asking for its secrets for too

long. That is why I am here. We want to

know how it works and I believe now,

finally... you will tell us.

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)

there's nothing they hate more... than

darkness.

No.

AMANDA

Spock.

AMANDA (CONT'D)

There is no need to be so anxious.

You'll do fine.

SPOCK

I am hardly "anxious", mother.

(beat, then, anxiously)

And "fine" has variable definitions.

"Fine" is unacceptable.

SPOCK (CONT'D)

May I ask a personal query?

AMANDA

... anything.

SPOCK

Should I choose to complete the Vulcan

discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all

emotion... I trust you will not feel it

reflects judgement upon you.

She stares at him, moved.      Touches his face.

AMANDA

As always... whoever you choose to be...

you will have a proud mother.

HOLD on mother and son, worlds apart but forever bonded:

58   INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY                  58

An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before

the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER,

seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS.

SCIENCE MINISTER

You have surpassed the expectations of

your instructors. Your final record is

flawless. With one exception. I see you

have applied to Starfleet as well.

SPOCK

It was logical to cultivate multiple

options.

SCIENCE MINISTER

Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby

accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.

A distinction all the more significant

given that you will be its first half-

human pupil. It is truly remarkable,

Spock. That you have achieved so much

despite your disadvantage. Welcome to

the Academy.

They all start to rise.      But Spock is suddenly unsettled:

SPOCK

If you would clarify, Minister-- what

"disadvantage" are you referring to?

SCIENCE MINISTER

... your human mother.

30

58   CONTINUED:                                                         58

As the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same

look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his

father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat.

His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes

the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --

SPOCK

Council -- ministers.    I must decline.

Everyone STOPS.   A solid BEAT.   Confused looks turn cold:

SCIENCE MINISTER

No Vulcan has ever declined admission to

this academy.

SPOCK

Then as I am half-human, your record

remains untarnished.

SAREK                               SPOCK

Spock. You have made a

commitment to honor the Vulcan       At the moment, Father, I can

way--                                think of no greater way to

honor our race than to attend

Starfleet as its first Vulcan.

SCIENCE MINISTER

Why did you come before this council

today? Was it to satisfy your emotional

need to rebel?

SPOCK

I came with the intention of enrolling,

as my father wished. However, your

"insight" has convinced me otherwise.

Therefore, the only emotion I wish to

convey is gratitude. Thank you,

Ministers, for your consideration.

(a contained "fuck you")

Live long and prosper.

He looks to his father, whose disappointment is evident --

still, God bless him, Spock walks out --

is going on through windows in the double-doors ahead -- and a

WOMAN SWOOPS INTO VIEW in front of us -- we PUSH BEHIND HER in

the short skirt and high boots as she ENTERS the place -- a

local, busy BAR -- the woman makes her way to the BAR, and we

see her GORGEOUS, DIGNIFIED FACE. THIS IS UHURA. She leans

into the bartender warmly, her smile glorious:

UHURA

Hi. I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two

Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth

beers, no slim-shots, anything on draft.

VOICE (O.S.)

That's a lot of drinks for one woman.

Wearing those boots.

JAMES KIRK'S FACE leans in: at 22, he's charming, witty,

dangerous, rebellious. He grins at her, flirty. Uhura gives

him a look, then back to the bartender:

UHURA

And a shot of Jack, straight up.

KIRK

(to the bartender)

Make it two -- her shot's on me.

UHURA

Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

KIRK

Don't you want my name before you

completely reject me?

UHURA

I'm good without it.

Damn, he likes her already.

KIRK

You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim

Kirk.

(long beat)

If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna

have to make one up.

UHURA

(beat)

Uhura.

KIRK

Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was

gonna make up for you. Uhura what?

UHURA

Just Uhura.

KIRK

They don't have last names in your world?

UHURA

Uhura is my last name.

KIRK

They don't have first names in your

world? Wait, let me guess. Is it "Jim"?

That makes her smile.    So he moves closer to her:

KIRK (CONT'D)

Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying.

What's your focus?

UHURA

Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't

know what that means.

KIRK

Let me guess: study of Alien languages:

phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means

you've got a talented tongue.

UHURA

And for a moment I thought you were just

a dumb hick who only has sex with farm

animals.

KIRK

Well.    Not only.

UHURA

You think you're smart.

KIRK

Oh, baby, I'm the smartest.

Something sad in that.    A BURLY STARFLEET CADET appears.

BURLY CADET

This guy bothering you?

UHURA

Beyond belief, but nothing I can't

handle.

KIRK

You could handle me.    That's an

invitation.

The Burly Cadet spins Kirk around:

BURLY CADET

Hey.    You mind your manners.

33

59   CONTINUED: (3)                                                     59

KIRK

At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke.     Like

your hairline.

Uhura turns back.    The other cadets, seeing trouble, approach.

UHURA

Hey -- Jim: enough.

BURLY CADET

What was that?

KIRK

You heard me, Moon Beam.

BURLY CADET

You know how to count farm boy?    There's

five of us... and one of you.

KIRK

Okay, so go get some more guys, come back

and it'll be an even fight.

The cadet swings his fist but Kirk HEADBUTTS HIS HAND, BREAKING

IT -- another Cadet PUNCHES KIRK, then THROWS HIM into a table,

which Kirk FLIES OVER, landing hard -- another Cadet GRABS HIM,

pulls him up -- Kirk SLAMS FIVE FAST PUNCHES that send the Cadet

back -- when ANOTHER CADET PUNCHES HIM -- yet another HOLDS KIRK

-- and that last punch is repeated THREE-- then FOUR times --

UHURA

Enough!    STOP!

Another punch and Kirk FLIES TO THE FLOOR - he's out of it, but

won't give up. The Cadets UNLEASH on him and really PUMMEL HIM -

- and Kirk's spirited, but LOSING -- about to LOSE BAD -- when

an EAR-SPLITTING WHISTLE makes everything STOP -- they turn --

standing in the doorway is a tall, rugged Starfleet officer --

CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER PIKE.

PIKE

Outside, all of you!       NOW!

The cadets file out, in for it. Pike moves to a dazed, semi-

conscious Kirk, now upside down on a table.

PIKE (CONT'D)

Y'alright, Son?

KIRK

You can... whistle really loud, y'know

that?

-- and Kirk PASSES OUT.

HIGH WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT of the almost-closed bar. Only Kirk and

Pike sit here at a table. Kirk's bloodied, tissue in his nose.

PIKE

I couldn't believe when the bartender

told me who you are.

KIRK

... and who am I, Captain Pike?

PIKE

Your father's son.

(then, smiles)

For my dissertation, I was assigned the

U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about

your dad... he didn't believe in no-win

scenarios.

KIRK

He sure learned his lesson.

PIKE

Depends on how you define winning.

You're here, aren't you?

(off Kirk's look)

That instinct to leap without looking--

that was his nature, too. And in my

opinion it's something Starfleet has

lost. We're admirable, respectable. But

overly-disciplined.

(beat)

Those cadets you took on, they'll make

competent officers -- but you can bet

your ass they'll run home to momma the

minute they're looking down the barrel of

a Klingon phaser cannon.

KIRK

-- why are you talking to me?

PIKE

I looked up your file while you were

drooling on the floor. Your aptitude

tests were off the charts-- what is it,

d'you like being the only Genius Level

repeat-offender in the midwest?

KIRK

Maybe I love it.

35

61   CONTINUED:                                                       61

PIKE

So your daddy dies... you can settle for

a less-than-ordinary life.

(beat)

Or do you feel like you're meant for

something better? Something special?

And that just hangs there for a beat. Because Pike just hit a

nerve. Kirk does his best not to show it -- still absent-

mindedly fiddling with STARFLEET SHIP SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.

KIRK

Come to think of it, I do want to feel

special. You know what? I'm gonna go

start a book club--

PIKE

Enlist in Starfleet.

KIRK

Enlist. You must be way down on your

recruiting quota for the month--

PIKE

If you're half the man your father was,

Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could

be an officer in four years, have your

own ship in eight.

He's getting under Kirk's skin -- but Kirk keeps up the 'tude,

grabs his jacket, stands --

KIRK

We're even, right?   I can go.

PIKE

Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new

recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.

(Kirk turns, Pike grabs

him)

Your father was Captain of a Starship.

For twelve minutes. I dare you to do

better.

Eyes lock... and it's now Pike who stands and walks off.   And

that's where it hangs. Off Kirk, brooding...

62   EXT. IOWA PLAINS - SUNRISE                                        62

Kirk pulls up to us, kills the bike. Camera starts to MOVE

AROUND HIM -- he's dramatically BACKLIT and we COME AROUND for

an INCREDIBLE REVEAL of a SHIPYARD -- at its center, the

skeletal frame of a NEW SHIP under arclights. UNMISTAKABLY, THE

U.S.S. ENTERPRISE. Unformed, raw, like its future captain. Our

MUSIC SWELLS, we PUSH IN ON HIM, considering Pike's offer, his

future, his fate.

64   EXT. STARFLEET SHIPYARD - MORNING                                64

The shipyard is abuzz with activity -- cadets loading into a

shuttle -- and Pike, staring off, waiting. The PILOT

approaches:

SHUTTLE PILOT

Waiting for something, Cap?

PIKE

... No.   Guess not.

He climbs in. The pilot rapidly flips through switches, running

a pre-flight sequence. Pike straps in. Glances through the

viewshield... SEES SOMETHING... and he smiles. From his POV:

KIRK on his MOTORCYCLE, driving into the shipyard --

PIKE (CONT'D)

Hold her a second...

Kirk rides past a WATERFALL of cooling tanks -- stops the bike

near the shuttle -- steps off, has nothing -- no bags -- just

the clothes on his back.

SHIPYARD WORKER

Nice ride, man.

Kirk kicks the stand, tosses the guy the startcard --

KIRK

Live it up.

Kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches Pike.

KIRK (CONT'D)

Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three.

Pike grins as Kirk passes him.

Inside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some

of them ALIEN. Passes UHURA and the BARFIGHT CADETS, who PERK

UP when they see him -- one has a BANDAGED HAND.

KIRK (CONT'D)

At ease, Gentlemen.

(then, to Uhura)

Never did get that first name.

UHURA

(can't help it: a grin)

And you never will.

He smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle.   Straps

in as it RISES...

MAN'S VOICE

Are you people deaf? I told you I don't

need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!

Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a

FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34, he has a Southern lilt and looks

like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall:

FLIGHT OFFICER                          MAN

-- you need to find a seat --     -- I had one, in the bathroom,

Darlin', with no windows --

-- Sir, for your own safety,      -- I suffer from Aviaphobia,

siddown, or I will MAKE you       case you don't understand big

sit down... do you hear me?       words, it means 'fear of dying

RIGHT NOW.                        in something that flies.'

They GLARE at each other, then the man drops into the seat

beside Kirk. The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his

armrests, pale, sweating -- glances at Kirk:

MAN

I might throw up on you.

KIRK

I think these things're pretty safe--

MAN

Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack

in the hull and our blood boils in

thirteen seconds -- solar flare might

crop up, cook us in our seats -- Hell,

some of the damn passengers are blue.

And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a

case of Andorian shingles, see if you're

still so relaxed when your eyeballs are

bleeding-- space is disease and danger,

wrapped in darkness and silence.

KIRK

I hate to break this to you, but

Starfleet operates in space.

I didn't ask if you have interest, I

asked if you'd do it.

MCCOY

I'm about to ask you an obvious question:

why bother?

KIRK

Because I've failed the test twice.

MCCOY

And you're determined to make it three.

We've all failed it-- everyone has, and

that's the point! No one goes back for

seconds, let alone thirds -- it's not

KIRK

So Bones: why do they make us take it?

MCCOY

I told you to stop calling me that.

You can't get caught in this dorm-- hide!

Kirk falls, lands hard on the floor, SCRAMBLES under the bed as

Gaila's roommate enters -- UHURA. Dropping her backpack:

GAILA (CONT'D)

Hey-- I thought you were going to be in

the long-range sensor lab all night.

UHURA

I was supposed to be, but it was crazy, I

picked up an emergency transmission from

a Klingon prison planet -- there was an

escape and a ship stolen from th--

(suddenly senses)

... you okay?

GAILA

Yeah, been running simulations all week,

just catching up on some rest. Tired.

(fake yawn)

That's all.

Uhura watches her.   Her eyes narrow.

UHURA

Were you running simulations with the

mouth-breather hiding under the bed?

Gaila freezes, caught.   Uhura looks down, Kirk PEERS OUT.

KIRK

Your hearing is scary-- you sure both

your parents are human?

UHURA

The hell are you doing with him in here?

GAILA                              JIM

You're gonna fail.

KIRK

No.   Good night.

I think the fact that you picked up a

ACADEMY PRESIDENT

James T. Kirk.     Step forward.

ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

An incident has occurred today that

concerns the entire student body.

Academic immorality by one is an assault

on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet

Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this

council suggesting you violated the

ethical code of conduct pursuant to

regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code.

Is there anything you care to say before

we begin?

KIRK

(uncomfortable beat)

Yessir. I believe I have the right to

face my accuser directly.

47

83   CONTINUED:                                                      83

President nods toward the assembly. SPOCK RISES. He and Kirk

MEET EYES for the first time. It's clock-stopping.

ACADEMY PRESIDENT

Step forward please. This is Commander

Spock, one of our most distinguished

graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi

Maru test for the last four years.

Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM.      President nods.

SPOCK

Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow

managed to install and activate a sub-

routine in the programming code, thereby

changing the conditions of the test.

We happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed.

KIRK

Your point being?

ACADEMY PRESIDENT

In academic vernacular, you cheated.

KIRK

Respectfully.    Define "cheating".

SPOCK

To deceive by trickery.

KIRK

Now let me ask you something I think we

all know the answer to: the test is

rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to

be unwinnable.

ACADEMY PRESIDENT

Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of

the exam is relevant to these

proceedings.

KIRK

Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test

itself is a cheat.

SPOCK

Your argument precludes the possibility

of a no-win scenario --

KIRK

I don't believe in no-win scenarios --

48

83   CONTINUED: (2)                                                      83

FIND PIKE amongst the officers in attendance. His eyes locked

on Kirk. This is his boy. His recruit. And he's INVESTED.

SPOCK

Then not only have you violated the

rules, you've failed to understand the

principle lesson.

KIRK

Please, enlighten me.

SPOCK

You, of all people should know, Cadet

Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.

ON KIRK. The first punch by Spock that landed.      The cockiness

slips away as he senses where this is going --

KIRK

"I of all people?"

SPOCK

Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had

assumed command of his vessel before

killed in action, did he not?

Shit.   The DADDY card.   Kirk, a mix of ANGER and EMBARRASSMENT --

KIRK

How long did it take you to look that up?

SPOCK

How long did it take you to program the

virus that allowed you to cheat?

The President smirks; considers ending this now but doesn't,

it's just too damn entertaining...

KIRK

Maybe you just don't like that I beat

your test.

SPOCK

I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our

vernacular. I've simply made the logical

deduction that you're a liar.

KIRK

What an idiot I am for taking that

personally --

SPOCK

Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to

divine the purpose of the test.

48A

83   CONTINUED: (3)                                                   83

KIRK

Enlighten me again.

SPOCK

The purpose is to experience fear. Fear

in the face of certain death. To accept

that fear and maintain command of one's

self and one's crew. This is a quality

expected in every Starfleet captain.

Kirk absorbs that.   Then --

KIRK

So you're telling me the point.      Of the

whole thing. Is to be afraid?

SPOCK

Fear is necessary, yes.

KIRK

Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?

SPOCK

Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no

additional training to control my

narcissism when making command decisions.

No he DIN'T!   Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all

but "OOOOOOHs." But Kirk ain't fucking done yet.

KIRK

You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan.

And I'm sure you're really proud of that,

who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you

people don't experience fear at all?

ON SPOCK. He raises that eyebrow. And Kirk sees... no matter

how subtly... that he has fucking made CONTACT. Smelling blood -

-

KIRK (CONT'D)

And if that's the case -- What's that say

about your ability to make command

decisions?

Well. Looks like Kirk just hit him in HIS fucking weak spot.

And before this lovefest can continue --

49

83   CONTINUED: (4)                                                   83

A REDSHIRT bursts into the HALL -- Kirk turns to look -- they

all do -- now we're SPEEDING IN behind the REDSHIRT, who runs to

the President, hands him a DATAPAD. President reads it.

Everyone watches, on edge -- finally, quietly:

ACADEMY PRESIDENT

(to all)

We've received a distress call from

Vulcan.

(Spock reacts concerned)

Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic

probation pending the result of your

hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle

Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is

at recess until further notice --

dismissed.

Everyone's on their feet, MOVING QUICKLY, Kirk suddenly

irrelevant. PIKE passes by him, all fucking business, but

before he goes --

PIKE

Cheating isn't winning.

And as that settles on Kirk, McCoy now joins him. The two

exiting with the rest of the cadets as Kirk eyes SPOCK --

KIRK

Who was that pointy-eared bastard?

MCCOY

I don't know, but I like him.

You're on academic probation. That means

Most likely.

(Kirk is just rocked)

Look, Jim -- I gotta go --

KIRK

Kirk forces a half-smile. Torn, McCoy hurries off. PULL AWAY

from Kirk, alone as the mass of newly-minted cadets criss-

crosses around him. At the hangar entrance, McCoy suddenly

STOPS: a lightbulb. He quickly returns to Kirk, pulls him off:

and suddenly we're moving in the OTHER DIRECTION as a pissed-off

Uhura serpentines through the group to SPOCK --

Spock moves away from the officers, a private moment with her:

SPOCK

SPOCK

SPOCK

It was an attempt to avoid the appearance

of favoritism.

She gets closer, voice low, all pride and defiance:

and advanced weaponry -- was never seen

or heard from again -- fact: the Kelvin

attack took place on the edge of Klingon

space and at 11-hundred hours last night

there was an escape from a Klingon prison

planet -- Rura Penthe -- fact: the

escaped prisoners were Romulans, Sir, and

it was reported that they stole a ship

from the prison dock.

Sir, I-- I intercepted and translated the

That's not it.     He said he wanted me to

home planet.

MCCOY

And how the hell did they do that by the

way? When did they jump so far ahead in

the arms race?

SPOCK

The engineering comprehension necessary

to artificially create a black hole may

suggest the answer: such technology could

theoretically be manipulated to create a

tunnel through space time.

MCCOY

Damnit, man, I'm a doctor, not a

physicist -- are you suggesting they're

from the future?

KIRK

That is what he's suggesting and I don't

buy it.

If you eliminate the impossible, whatever

remains -- however improbable -- must be

the truth.

MCCOY

How poetic.

Then what would an angry future Romulan

want with Captain Pike?

Nero's ship would have to drop out of

There won't be a next engagement, Spock:

by the time we've "gathered", it'll be

too late -- how many planets are you

willing to risk? You say he's from the

future? Knows what's gonna happen? Then

the logical thing is to be unpredictable.

SPOCK

You're assuming Nero knows how events are

predicted to unfold. The contrary:

Nero's very presence has altered the flow

of history, beginning with the attack on

the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the

events of today -- thereby creating a new

chain of incidents that cannot be

anticipated by either party.

KIRK

(sympathy, surprise)

... so you do feel...

SPOCK PRIME

"Cthia" is the stricture that binds our

emotions... but few of us are that

perfectly Vulcan.

KIRK

Going back in time... you changed all our

lives.

SPOCK PRIME

Yet remarkably, events within our

timelines, characteristics, people...

seem to overlap significantly. Tell me

about the rest of the crew? Chekov--

Uhura --?

KIRK

Tactical and Communications --

SPOCK PRIME

-- Sulu --

KIRK

-- he's the helmsman, why?

SPOCK PRIME

Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here

is not a matter of coincidence... but

rather, indication of a higher purpose.

KIRK

... he'd call it a damn miracle.

SPOCK PRIME

Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's

way of attempting to mend itself. In

both our histories, the same crew found

its way onto the same ship in a time of

ultimate crisis -- therein lies our

advantage.

(rises)

We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost

not far from here.

father?

SPOCK PRIME

... yes. You often spoke of him as your

inspiration for joining starfleet.

SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)

You should know. He proudly lived to see

you become captain of the Enterprise.

KIRK

... Captain?

SPOCK PRIME

A ship we must return you to as soon as

possible.

You wanted to see me?

SPOCK

(discreet tone)

Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk

is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as

you did, must have been difficult.

MCCOY

SPOCK

I'm simply acknowledging your

difficulties.

MCCOY

Permission to speak freely, Sir.

SPOCK

I welcome it.

MCCOY

Do you. Okay then: are you out of your

Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical

thing? Maybe. The right one?

Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure

-- that kid doesn't know how to lose.

Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have

a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the

Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize

stallion in the stable."

SPOCK

... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a

stallion must first be broken before it

can reach its potential.

MCCOY

My God, Man... you could at least act

like it was a hard decision.

SPOCK

I intended to assist in the effort to re-

establish communication with Starfleet.

However, if crew morale would be better

served by my roaming the halls weeping,

I'll gladly defer to your medical

expertise.

Six months I've been living on nothing

but Starfleet Protein Nibs and the

promise of a real food delivery! Six

months, boys! It's pretty clear what's

going on here, isn't it? Punishment!

Ongoing! For something that was clearly

an accident!

SPOCK PRIME

You're Montgomery Scott.

KIRK

You know him?

SCOTTY

Yes, that's me -- Scotty-- you're in the

right place-- are there any other hard-

working and equally-starving Starfleet

officers around?

KEENSER

Me.

SCOTTY

You eat nothing. A bean and you're done

for a week, I need food. And now you're

here -- so. Thank you. Where is it.

SPOCK PRIME

You are in fact the Mr. Scott who

postulated the theory of trans-warp

beaming.

SCOTTY

Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking

about! How d'ya think I ended up here?

I got into a debate with my instructor on

the issue of Relativistic Physics as they

pertain to subspace travel... He seemed

to think that the range of transporting

say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few

hundred miles -- so I told my instructor

I could not only beam a bird from one

planet to an adjacent planet in the same

system -- which is no big deal anyway --

but if I were so inclined I could

actually do it with a lifeform! So I

tested it on Admiral Archer's prize

beagle. Which... was a mistake.

KIRK

I know that dog. What happened to it?

SCOTTY

I'll tell ya when it reappears.     Dunno.

Feel guilty.

SPOCK PRIME

What if I told you your trans-warp theory

was correct? That it is indeed possible

to beam onto a ship that is travelling at

warp speed. And that you only required

the correct field equation to

recrystallize dilithium?

SCOTTY

I haven't been stationed here that long.

If such an equation had been discovered,

I'da heard.

SPOCK PRIME

The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr.

Scott... is because you haven't

discovered it yet.

SCOTTY

Y'from the future, are ya? Brilliant.

D'they still have sandwiches where you're

from? Piece and jam? Mince 'n tatties?

Cockaleekie soup?

KIRK

What is he talking about?

KEENSER

Food.

SPOCK PRIME

Allow us access to your shuttle... and I

will show you what a genius you actually

are.

Your equation for achieving trans-warp

SCOTTY

Imagine that! Never occurred to me to

think of space as the part that's moving.

SPOCK PRIME

Point of fact: it did occur to you.

(he works the console)

Extrapolating Enterprise's course --

SCOTTY

-- Enterprise? Had its maiden voyage

already, has it? Well, you must've done

something right to be assigned to that

ship, Kiddo. She's a well endowed lady --

love to get my hands on her ample

nacelles, if you'll pardon the

engineering parlance.

SPOCK PRIME

Now's your chance, Mr. Scott.

SCOTTY

Look, even if I believed you -- where

you're from, what I've done-- which I

don't -- we're still talkin' bout

slingshotting aboard while she's going

faster than light. Without a proper

receiving pad, that's like tryin'a hit a

bullet with a smaller bullet, wearing a

blindfold. On a horse.

SPOCK

I calculate no more than a four meter

margin of error.

SCOTTY

That's all well and good unless you

rematerialize four meters outside the

ship.

best option: a large space and no

unpredictable airlocks --

KIRK

SPOCK PRIME

No, Jim. My destiny lies along a

different path.

KIRK                          SPOCK PRIME

You must promise me this.

KIRK

You're telling me I can't tell you I'm

following your own orders? Why not?

What happens?

SPOCK PRIME

Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the

one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero,

you alone must take command of your ship.

KIRK

How, over your dead body?

SPOCK PRIME

Preferably not. There is, however,

Starfleet Regulation 619.

(off Kirk's confusion)

Yes. I forget what little regard you had

for such things. 619 states that any

commanding officer who is emotionally

compromised by the mission at hand...

must resign said command.

KIRK

So I need to emotionally compromise you?

SPOCK PRIME

Jim.  I just lost my planet. I can tell

you.  I am emotionally compromised.

(then)

What you must do... is get me to show it.

KIRK

Yes, Chekov-- you don't need to ask

permission to--

CHEKOV

Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan,

I've projected that Nero will travel past

Saturn. If we could drop out of warp

behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,

the magnetic distortion from the planet's

rings will make us invisible to Nero's

sensors. We could follow him to Earth by

staying in his blind spot.

KIRK

What blind spot?

CHEKOV

Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our

shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect

us.

MCCOY

Wait a minute-- anyone understand this

kid? How old are you?

CHEKOV

I am seventeen, Sir, how old are you?

MCCOY

We're all old enough to shave here.

Doctor... Mr. Chekov is correct.

SPOCK (CONT'D)

I have reviewed his telemetry. If Mr.

Sulu can maneuver us into position, I can

beam aboard Nero's ship.

KIRK

I won't order you to do that, Mr. Spock.

Because you needed each other. Opposing

you and Kirk -- that often made the

impossible, possible.

... it was a test?

SPOCK PRIME

(no: his heart heavy)

I'm in no position to pass judgment...

my actions have robbed you of much. I

could not also deprive you the revelation

of all you can accomplish together... of

a friendship that will define you both in

ways you cannot yet realize.

secret?

I inferred universe-ending paradoxes

would ensue should he break his promise.

his younger self. The feeling in his eyes is profound...

good luck.

Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.

Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a

jumble of thoughts. Looks to the pendant... and realizes it's a

HOLO-EMITTER. After considering a beat, he hits an activation

button and a MOVING HOLOGRAPHIC MESSAGE materializes before him:

CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK. WILLIAM SHATNER.      As always, brash, wry,

confident -- and SINGING:

Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to

you...

I know I know, it's illogical to

celebrate something you had nothing to do

with, but I haven't had the chance to

congratulate you on your appointment to

the occasion... Bravo, Spock -- they tell

you luck... and to say...

UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at

attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of

them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud:

KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)

I look around at the new cadets now and

can't help thinking... has it really been

so long? Wasn't it only yesterday we

stepped onto the Enterprise as boys?

That I had to prove to the crew I

deserved command... and their respect?

And we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, proud. A man.

And to every fan's delight, finally wearing his YELLOW SHIRT.

The FEDERATION COMMANDANT stands at a podium:

Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --

Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an

ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --

but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE

each other:

KIRK

I relieve you, Sir.

PIKE

... I am relieved.

He opens a BOX in his lap -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

PIKE (CONT'D)

And as Fleet Admiral, for your... unique

solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it's my

honor to award you with a commendation

for original thinking.

Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest...

PIKE (CONT'D)

(a touch choked)

Congratulations, Captain.

KIRK

Thank you, Sir.

Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE.    OUR

MUSIC SOARS. Bones leans in to Sulu, rolling his eyes:

BONES

... Same ship, different day.

As Kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to

the BACK of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond

words. He turns and leaves them to it... as he goes...

KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)

I know what you'd say -- `It's their turn

now, Jim...' And of course you're

right... but it got me thinking:

INT. STARFLEET HOSPITAL - EARTH - DAY

Our montage comes full circle as we END on Kirk's transmission:

KIRK/SHATNER

Who's to say we can't go one more round?

By the last tally, only twenty five

percent of the galaxy's been chartered...

I'd call that negligent. Criminal even --

an invitation.

CONTINUED:

KIRK/SHATNER (CONT'D)

You once said being a starship captain

was my first, best destiny... if that's

true, then yours is to be by my side. If

there's any true logic to the universe...

we'll end up on that bridge again

someday.

Stops, grins.   Because this is the part he needs to say most...

KIRK

Admit it, Spock. For people like us, the

journey itself... is home.

Young Spock's face.   Lost in feelings that flood through him.
