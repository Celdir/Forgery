Final Draft

MERLIN

Lord Uther! Lord Uther!

MERLIN

It's done. A truce. We meet at the

river.

UTHER

(disgusted)

Talk. Lovers murmuring to each

other...

DUKE OF CORNWALL

I spit on your truce, Uther. If you

want peace, throw down your swords.

UTHER

I should butcher all and every one

of them. Merlin, what is this wagging

of tongues?

MERLIN

Just show the sword.

MERLIN

(waxing eloquent)

Behold the sword of power, Excalibur.

Before Uther, it belonged to Lud,

before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf

to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to

Thor himself and that was when the

world was young and there were more

than seven colors in the rainbow.

(and in an aside to

Uther)

Speak the words.

UTHER

(bellowing)

One land, one king! That is my peace!

DUKE OF CORNWALL

Lord Uther, if I yield to the sword

of power, what will you yield?

UTHER

Me, yield!?

MERLIN

(a whisper)

He has given. Now you must.

UTHER

The land from here to the sea is

yours if you will enforce the King's

will.

DUKE OF CORNWALL

Done!

DUKE OF CORNWALL

My Lord King Uther, let us feast

together. To my castle. Lord Merlin,

you must join -

DUKE OF CORNWALL

I would wish you such a wife, Lord

Uther, as my Igrayne. So innocent,

but in bed, a furnace...

UTHER

I must have her.

LOT

What? You're mad! What about the

alliance?

UTHER

(oblivious)

I must have her.

LOT

And risk all you've won? This castle

commands the sea gate to the kingdom.

UTHER

You will be mine. Wife and queen,

bed and crown.

IGRAYNE

(a fierce whisper)

I want no other crown and no other

bed than those I have.

UTHER

(bellowing in all

directions)

Merlin! Where are you!?

UTHER

Have you found him?

ULFIUS

No--

HAG

What a hurry you were in this morning,

good sir. You forgot to give this

old woman a coin.

ULFIUS

I saw you half a day's gallop from

here. I asked you if you had seen

Merlin. I returned here straight

away. How did -

HAG

--I heard. I have come. I am also

Merlin.

MERLIN

I have walked my way since the

beginning of time. Sometimes I give,

sometimes I take. It is mine to know

which, and when.

UTHER

(exploding)

Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.

MERLIN

I know the storm inside you, and

what it has wrought. The alliance I

forged is wrecked.

UTHER

For Igrayne. One night with her. Do

it. Use the magic.

MERLIN

You will swear by your true kingship

to grant me what I wish. Then you

shall have it.

UTHER

I swear it. By Excalibur and the

holy--

MERLIN

--What issues from your lust will be

mine. Swear it again.

UTHER

I swear it.

DUKE OF CORNWALL

(to a lieutenant)

It's Uther and all his best knights.

He leaves behind little more than

fledglings to guard his camp.

MERLIN

Come.

MERLIN

I hold the balance of all things in

my summoning. Arise mists. Come fog.

MERLIN

Mount your horse.

MERLIN

Ride straight to the castle, across

the sea of fog.

UTHER

But the cliff, the sea...

MERLIN

Ride across! Across the bridges of

desire. Your lust will hold you up.

For I have just woven it into the

fabric of the world. This is magic -

making solid what is in the mind,

and unsolid, that which is already

solid.

RIDER

(calling)

Wake up in there. It is I.

'DUKE' OF CORNWALL

Have the horse ready. I ride out

before sunrise.

MORGANA

Papa... Papa...

MORGANA

My father is dead...

IGRAYNE

Look, here is your father. It was

just a dream, little one.

'DUKE' OF CORNWALL

Come Igrayne.

MERLIN

It is done. The future has found

root in the present.

IGRAYNE

When did it happen? Where?

LIEUTENANT

In the camp of Uther, my lady, just

after nightfall.

IGRAYNE

It can't be. He came to me, to his

bed, last night.

LADY

It was his spirit, yearning for you

in his hour of death, that visited

you.

IGRAYNE

His spirit?

IGRAYNE

Tintagel Castle falls to Uther. But

what shall become of me, and the

child I bear?

UTHER

I want her, Merlin. I cannot be

without her. Tintagel is mine. Can I

take her now? Tell me!

UTHER

(bellowing)

Three horses died under me, so hard

did I spur them here. Is it born? Is

it alive?

UTHER

Out!

UTHER

What is it, lady?

IGRAYNE

A boy, sir. Rest yourself.

UTHER

Send the girl away.

IGRAYNE

She is just a child -

UTHER

Out!

IGRAYNE

(whispering)

Go now. Come back later.

UTHER

She watches me with her father's

eyes.

UTHER

Igrayne, is he mine, or -

IGRAYNE

The night he died, a man loved me

with great fierceness. He looked

like my husband, spoke like, smelled

like, felt like my own husband. But

it was not he, for he was already

dead. It wasn't his spirit, for this

child, who was conceived that night,

is flesh and blood. I know nothing

more.

IGRAYNE

No--

UTHER

Through him, I will learn to love

them, for I am tired of battle. I

will stay by his side and

(looking shyly at

Igrayne)

his mother's...

UTHER

Here. It's hungry.

UTHER

Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at

last.

MERLIN

Doing what I did for you, it wasn't

easy, you know. It takes it's toll.

It took nine moons to get back my

strength.

MERLIN

Now you must pay me.

UTHER

I?

MERLIN

The child is mine, Uther. I have

come for him.

UTHER

The oath. You didn't say--

MERLIN

You didn't ask!

IGRAYNE

Uther, is it true? Don't let him

take the child.

UTHER

I swore an oath, Igrayne. I made a

pact with Merlin.

IGRAYNE

It was you? You came to me that night.

You are the father.

MERLIN

It's not for you, Uther, hearth and

home, wife and child.

UTHER

To kill and be king, is that all?

MERLIN

Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought

once that you were the one to unite

the land under one sword. But it'll

take another, a greater king...

UTHER

You strike me with words as hard as

steel.

MERLIN

They are not weapons, my friend, but

truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole

his wife and took his castle, now no

one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your

allies will turn against you. Give

me the child, Uther, I will protect

him. Go back to your war tent.

UTHER

(in torment)

By the oath, take the devil child.

Take him!

IGRAYNE

WHY?... Why must he have the baby?

MORGANA

Merlin, are you now the father, and

the mother, of the baby?

URYENS

(to his men)

The King's sword. I must have it.

UTHER

Merlin, where are you? To weave a

mist, to hide us...

UTHER

No one shall have the sword. No one

shall wield Excalibur but me.

MERLIN

Into the spine of the dragon!

(and then he is

saddened)

Uther... I loved you, mighty child.

LOT

Let me.

FADE OUT:

SIR ECTOR

It is a dark hour... everywhere

lawlessness and destruction, and no

one to lead us out of it.

SIR ECTOR

Listen all. I am Sir Ector of Morven

and these are my sons. You would

wrong me, for I have never stolen

from others, or destroyed the fruit

of the land.

SIR ECTOR

The people's anger is just. It is

sad that for our own safety, we will

have to ride to the tournament with

these robber knights.

BISHOP

This is Easter day, when Christ rose

again. Who will find strength in

victory of arms? Who will draw the

sword?

SIR ECTOR

Arthur, where is Kay's sword? A good

squire doesn't forget his knight's

sword.

ARTHUR

I left it in the tent, sir.

SIR ECTOR

Well hurry then, and get it.

ARTHUR

It's been stolen....

SIR KAY

Father, I'll go and see what's keeping

him.

ARTHUR

If only Kay could have it...

ARTHUR

(breathless)

Your sword was stolen, Kay, but here

is Excalibur. Is it too late? I

hurried--

SIR KAY

Look, Father. Excalibur. Does that

mean that I am to be king?

SIR ECTOR

Did you free the sword, boy?

SIR KAY

I... did, Father.

SIR ECTOR

We must go to the stone at once.

SIR ECTOR

Draw it, son!

SIR KAY

Sir, I didn't draw the sword. Arthur

gave it to me.

SIR ECTOR

Arthur ?!

(spinning around to

face him)

How did you get the sword, child?

ARTHUR

(frightened)

Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was

stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I

took it.

SIR ECTOR

You freed it, son?

ARTHUR

I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.

SIR ECTOR

Try the sword, Arthur.

URYENS

Stand back, Sir Ector, and take your

children.

LOT

We will try again.

SIR ECTOR

Let the boy try the sword.

BISHOP

Let the boy try...

SIR ECTOR

Go ahead, boy. Don't be afraid.

BISHOP

We have our King, thanks be to God.

ARTHUR

Please, Father, rise up. I was your

son before I became your King... if

I am King.

SIR ECTOR

My Lord, you are King, all the more

because you are not my son, and I am

not your father.

ARTHUR

Who is, then?

SIR ECTOR

I don't know. Merlin brought you to

me when you were newly born and

charged me to raise you as my own.

At first, I did so because I feared

Merlin, later because I loved you.

ARTHUR

Who is Merlin?

MERLIN

Speak of the devil!...

MERLIN

I am Merlin. Counselor to kings.

Wizard and beggar. Prophet and...

(he drops it)

I have feasted on thunderbolts, I

savored my death before I got myself

born. I--

ARTHUR

Whose son am I?

MERLIN

You are the son of King Uther, and

the fair Igrayne... you are King

Arthur.

LOT

Merlin, we haven't forgotten you.

This is more of your trickery.

URYENS

You're trying to foist a boy of

dubious birth upon us. You want to

shame us?

LOT

Lord Leondegrance, join us against

the boy. Surely you can see he is

only Merlin's tool.

LEONDEGRANCE

No. I, Leondegrance, Lord of

Camelyarde, saw the drawing of Uther's

sword, and witnessed no trickery. If

a boy has been chosen, a boy shall

be king.

ARTHUR

...Merlin... Merlin...

ARTHUR

Merlin!

MERLIN

You called, sir?

ARTHUR

You saved me from the arrow...

MERLIN

(a flicker of mischief)

But not from your destiny.

ARTHUR

I want to thank you.

MERLIN

That's not why you came.

ARTHUR

Merlin, help me. I need your help. I

don't know how--

MERLIN

(irritated)

'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.

MERLIN

I'm tired. Doing magic takes its

toll, you know. My arms ache

terribly...

(he makes flying

movements with his

arms and grimaces)

Once--or is it yet to happen--I stood

exposed to the Dragon's breath so

that a man could lie one night with

a woman. It took me ten moons to

recover. I'm sure that story would

interest you, since... Well, we'll

have to talk about it another time.

You're too busy now.

MERLIN

It is whispered in the forest that...

(he cups his ear with

exaggeration)

...Leondegrance's castle is under

siege by Lot and Uryens.

ARTHUR

(pressing)

Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody

does. Lord Leondegrance is my only

ally among the barons and the great

knights. I can't lose him.

MERLIN

Well there. You don't need me half

as much as you think you do. You

already know what must not happen.

ARTHUR

(exasperated)

I must find the means to save him,

then. I was hoping I could ask you

for a little magic help, but if it

makes you so tired...

MERLIN

Thank you.

ARTHUR

It's just that I have no experience,

and no men to speak of. How can I--

MERLIN

(suddenly fierce)

Because you must! You and only you.

Have you forgotten that it was you

who freed Excalibur?

MERLIN

Besides, it will be a good lesson.

(giggling)

The best, if it's not the last.

MERLIN

Maybe you'd like to meet the power

that gave you the sword?

ARTHUR

How? Where?

MERLIN

In the great book.

ARTHUR

What book is that?

MERLIN

(melodramatic)

The book without pages. Open before

you, all around us. You can see it

in bits and pieces, for if mortal

men were to see it whole and all

complete in a single glance, why, it

would burn him to cinders.

ARTHUR

What?!

MERLIN

The dragon! There...

MERLIN

Coiled in the unfathomed depths, it

emerges...

MERLIN

...It unfolds itself in the storm

clouds...

MERLIN

...it washes its mane sparkling white

in the blackness of seething

whirlpools...

MERLIN

...its claws are the forks of

lightning... its scales glisten in

the bark of trees...

MERLIN

...its voice is heard in the

hurricane...

MERLIN

...it is so much more than a scaly

monster. It is Everything!

ARTHUR

And if I am to be King of everything,

lord and commoner, beast, leaf and

rock, I must use its voice, its claws,

its power.

GUENEVERE

Father, it's the boy King.

LEONDEGRANCE

It is. I will fight my way to his

side.

URYENS

War-wise fighters, grown gray in

battle, checkmated by a boy.

LOT

It's Merlin's trickery, nothing more.

I won't swear faith to that wizard's

brat.

ARTHUR

Let's finish this with a show of

force. We have no more tricks and no

more advantages.

GUENEVERE

No...

SIR ECTOR

No... Arthur--

ARTHUR

You are in my hands, to slay or spare.

I need battle lords such as you.

Swear faith to me and you shall have

mercy.

URYENS

Noble knights swear faith to a mere

squire?

ARTHUR

You are right. I'm not yet a knight.

(gaining strength)

You, Uryens, will knight me.

ARTHUR

Then as knight to knight I can offer

you mercy.

MERLIN

(to himself)

What's this, what's this?!

MERLIN

I never saw this...

URYENS

In the name of God, of Saint Michael

and Saint George, I give you the

right to bear arms, the power to

mete justice.

ARTHUR

That duty I will solemnly obey as

knight and King.

URYENS

Rise, my King. I am your humble

knight, and I swear allegiance to

the courage in your veins, for so

strong it is, it's source must be

Uther. I doubt you no more.

ARTHUR

Owww...

GUENEVERE

It didn't hurt too much, did it?

ARTHUR

Ye...

GUENEVERE

--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've

sewn my father's wounds more than

once.

GUENEVERE

Careful! You'll have to stay still

for a few days or you'll tear them

open.

ARTHUR

But I have to leave tomorrow. The

forests are thick with rebels,

invaders plunder our shores...

GUENEVERE

--And damsels in besieged castles

are waiting to be rescued?

ARTHUR

I didn't know Leondegrance had a

daughter.

GUENEVERE

Well, then, I shall tell you which

knights have maiden daughters, so

you can avoid their castles.

GUENEVERE

No, I think it's better if you just

stay here to heal. At least a week.

ARTHUR

I'm going.

GUENEVERE

Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth

too.

GUENEVERE

Would you rescue me from a fiery

dragon, sir?

GUENEVERE

It's just a furry little rabbit that

took the bait and sprung the trap.

GUENEVERE

You'll find him served up to you

tonight, cooked in a most excellent

sauce...

MERLIN

A king must marry, after all.

ARTHUR

...of course...

ARTHUR

I love her. If she would be my queen,

my dreams would be answered.

MERLIN

(mischievous)

There are maidens as fair, and fairer

than Guenevere. If I put my mind to

it, I could see them now, many of

them, weeping for love of you,

watching the hills for you coming

from the high towers of their castles.

Offering you their every favor. Rich,

clever--but if it is to be Guenevere,

so be it.

ARTHUR

Who will it be? Put your mind to it,

then.

MERLIN

Guenevere. And a beloved friend who

will betray you.

ARTHUR

(smiling)

Guenevere...

MERLIN

You're not listening. Your heart is

not. Love is deaf as well as blind.

GUENEVERE

They are only for you, for in them I

mixed things that heal, but not too

quickly; and things that make limbs

sleepy, preventing escape, but keep

one's mind sharp.

ARTHUR

What's in them?

GUENEVERE

It is an ancient mixture, containing

only soft, unborn grains, and flavored

with roses. The rest is secret.

MERLIN

Looking at the cake is like looking

at the future. Until you have savored

its bitterness and its sweetness,

its texture and its perfume, what do

you really know? And then, of course,

it will he too late.

MERLIN

Too late...

FADE OUT:

SIR ECTOR

He is the mightiest and fairest of

knights.

ARTHUR

We fought and won battles, and now

one man defeats all my knights? I

will go.

SIR KAY

A king must not engage in single

contest. I'll go again.

ARTHUR

Where is Merlin?

ARTHUR

(angry)

I should have left you to fend for

yourself.

MERLIN

I had to weave a little enchantment

on the bees so I could get some honey,

and I didn't feel up to using any

more magic just yet. Anyway, I was

in less danger than you'll be in

today.

ARTHUR

So you were stealing their honey.

They should have killed you.

MERLIN

Come now. So much anger for such a

little crime? Are you sure there is

nothing else troubling you?

ARTHUR

You know full well there is, and I

go to meet it now. Come witness my

revenge.

LANCELOT

Good day to you, sir.

ARTHUR

Move aside. This is the King's road,

and the knights you joined arms

against were his very own.

LANCELOT

I await the King himself. His knights

are in need of training.

ARTHUR

I am King, and this is Excalibur,

sword of kings from the dawn of time.

Who are you, and why do you block

the way?

LANCELOT

I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from

across the sea. I am the best knight

in the whole of Christiandom, and I

look for the king who is worthy of

my sword's service.

ARTHUR

--That is a wild boast. You lack a

knight's humility.

LANCELOT

Not a boast, sir, but a curse.

(a cloud passes over

his innocent face)

Never have I met my match in joust

or duel.

ARTHUR

Move aside!

LANCELOT

I will not. You must retreat or prove

your kingship in the test of arms,

under the eyes of God.

ARTHUR

Then may He give me the strength to

unhorse you and send you with one

blow back across the sea.

LANCELOT

Hold! I offer you another lance.

LANCELOT

You joust well, sir. Battle learnt,

but tournament fancy. You should

ride more forward in the saddle,

though.

LANCELOT

Yield. I have the advantage.

ARTHUR

I will not.

ARTHUR

Fight me from your horse or on foot,

but fight me. Your avoidance mocks

me.

LANCELOT

I sought only not to harm you, sir.

LANCELOT

Sir, your rage has unbalanced you.

It seems you would fight to the death

against a knight who is not your

enemy, for a length of road you can

ride around.

ARTHUR

So be it, to the death.

LANCELOT

It is you, sir, who knows not the

virtue of humility, as a true king

must.

ARTHUR

What horror is this?

(calling)

Merlin!

MERLIN

The sword is broken. Hope is broken...

ARTHUR

My pride broke it, my rage broke

it... Humiliation and defeat lie in

ambush even for a king.

(looking at Lancelot)

This excellent knight who fought

with fairness and grace was meant to

win. With Excalibur, I tried to change

that verdict.

ARTHUR

I have lost for all time the ancient

sword of my fathers whose power was

meant to unite all men, to serve the

vanity of a single man.

ARTHUR

I am nothing.

ARTHUR

Excalibur! Is it true?

MERLIN

The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take

it, quickly!

MERLIN

There are infinite worlds within the

infinite coils of the Dragon. In one

of them, which I have not traveled,

the sword was forged. I only know

that the King is returned to us

through the instrument of his power.

The game continues!

ARTHUR

Thanks to God, you are alive.

LANCELOT

(sitting up)

I, the best knight in the world,

bested! This is a great day, for my

search is over. I love you, my King.

ARTHUR

You are still the best knight in

Christiandom. You gained a hundred

advantages over me. It is I who must

love you, for through your courage

and patience you taught me a bitter

lesson.

LANCELOT

Then make me your champion and I

will always fight in your place.

ARTHUR

But your life and lands are far from

here.

LANCELOT

I gave up my castles and my lands!

LANCELOT

My domain is here, inside this metal

skin. And I would pledge to you all

that I still own: muscle, bone, blood

and the heart that pumps it.

ARTHUR

And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot,

you will be my champion.

LANCELOT

In the name of Jesus Christ and His

holy blood, I swear eternal faith to

Arthur, King.

KNIGHT

...We killed every one of them. Burnt

their ship...

ARTHUR

Lancelot, how did you fare in the

North?

LANCELOT

We spared the lives of a few, so

they could sail home and tell their

fellows what fate they met at the

hands of King Arthur's knights...

ARTHUR

And you, Uryens?

URYENS

Victory!

ARTHUR

Lot, and you?

LOT

We drove the invaders into the sea.

ARTHUR

You, Gawain, the East?

GAWAIN

The East is ours again.

ARTHUR

The war is over. One land, one King.

Peace.

KNIGHT

Let me through. I fought the King's

battle too. He must know my story.

MERLIN

Chaos... confusion... brutes...

savages... troglodytes... Stand

back... make space.

MERLIN

The moon... the sun... the stars...

they spin... they turn... they

circle... around us... us...

MERLIN

You, and you, and you, take up your

place. Be wedded to the world. Respect

its perfection. All of you, together,

be one.

ARTHUR

Your ancient wisdom and infinite

sight have forged this circle, Merlin.

Hereafter we shall come together in

a circle, to tell and hear of deeds

good and brave. I will build a table

where this fellowship shall meet.

And a hall around the table. And a

castle about the hall.

ARTHUR

And I will marry.

ARTHUR

And the land will have an heir to

wield Excalibur.

ARTHUR

Knights of the Round Table, good

friends, brothers in arms. I send

you on a quest harder by far than

the battles we have fought together,

a quest to uphold always, and

everywhere, justice, honor, and truth.

Each day shall bring forth a cause,

and may each cause bring forth a

knight.

LANCELOT

I swear never to rest twice on the

same pillow till all men live at

peace.

KNIGHT

Good day, sir.

LANCELOT

Good day to you.

LANCELOT

I hear the stifled cry for help, I

smell the reek of fear...

LANCELOT

These men repented before God for

their evil deeds. Those who would

not, met their fate at the end of my

sword.

(he kneels)

Accept the fruit of my first quest

as my wedding gift.

ARTHUR

I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.

ARTHUR

Sit beside me, Lancelot.

ARTHUR

Your deeds set an example for all

other knights. For your gift, ask a

gift of me.

LANCELOT

Only give me leave to ride out again,

to do what I am most able to do, and

happiest doing.

GUENEVERE

(to Arthur)

He must stay for the feasting days

of our wedding, and tell his deeds

himself.

ARTHUR

(to Lancelot, smiling)

I grant you your wish if you grant

Lady Guenevere hers.

LANCELOT

I will stay Madame.

MERLIN

The knights of Galys approach the

camp. It would be politic...

ARTHUR

...to ride out and meet them.

ARTHUR

I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot,

rest here.

GUENEVERE

Don't start a war on my wedding day!

ARTHUR

Without Lancelot?!

GUENEVERE

Look Lancelot. The maids and ladies

whisper about you. They all dream of

winning you, young and old, fair and

ugly.

GUENEVERE

But surely that's no secret to you,

dear Lancelot. You're the bravest

and strongest knight they've ever

seen, and beauty has kissed your

brow.

GUENEVERE

The well-kept secret is whether any

of them has won your heart.

LANCELOT

No.

GUENEVERE

Why?

LANCELOT

I am a fighting man and I am married

to the quest. That is enough.

GUENEVERE

And there is no maiden in the whole

world who inspires you?

LANCELOT

There is one.

GUENEVERE

Who?!

LANCELOT

You.

GUENEVERE

Me?

LANCELOT

Yes. I would swear my love to you.

GUENEVERE

To me? But why?

LANCELOT

I cannot love as a woman the lady

who will be wife to my King and my

friend. And, in pledging my love to

you, I cannot love any other woman.

LANCELOT

I will see you in all women, and I

will defend them as I would defend

you.

LANCELOT

Lord Merlin, are you ill?

MERLIN

No, no, I need air.

URYENS

Merlin, don't you join the

celebration?

URYENS

My wife, Merlin. Lady Morgana of

Cornwall.

MORGANA

I remember you, Merlin. I was a child.

You took my brother away.

MERLIN

You left your husband's side? You

left your brother's wedding?

MORGANA

Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?

MERLIN

It is.

MORGANA

Can it truly be used for magic?

MERLIN

Yes... sometimes...

MERLIN

...There are many powers in this

world.

BISHOP

Drink this the blood of Jesus Christ

our Lord.

FADE OUT:

PERCEVAL

(to the rabbit)

Sorry. Hungry.

PERCEVAL

(stuttering)

Have I taken too much?

PERCEVAL

(desperately trying

to ingratiate)

I had rabbit yesterday. Today I'll

eat fish... No?

LANCELOT

Don't be afraid.

PERCEVAL

You're an angel! Not a devil...

LANCELOT

Just a man. A knight in the King's

service.

PERCEVAL

You're a man?!

(he reaches out to

touch Lancelot)

...with metal skin!

PERCEVAL

Can I grow metal skin?

LANCELOT

You've got a lot to learn.

PERCEVAL

I'll learn... take me... to the

King... What's a... King?

LANCELOT

Very well. Climb up.

PERCEVAL

I will run.

LANCELOT

Listen, boy, it's more than twenty

days from here.

PERCEVAL

Twenty days!? The world is that big?

PERCEVAL

Who will give me my sword?

KAY

Kitchen knives and greasy spits will

be your weapons, boy.

FAT MAN

I brew ale, sir--from

old shoes--I am an

honest tradesman sir.

I must sell what I

produce. He won't buy

ale and he won't pay.

Pay up! He leans over

the barrel and sucks

in the vapors. The

vapors are mine.

THIN MAN

How would you know I, sir,

have the misfortune to

live next to this

criminal... What loss in

that? Not to me! Pay for

what? Why?! They are

floating on the wind.

ARTHUR

Enough!... What is a fair price for

the smell of your ale?

FAT MAN

That's why we have come to you, sir

There's no one else who can tell us.

ARTHUR

What does it cost to get drunk on

your ale?

FAT MAN

At least three shillings, sir.

ARTHUR

Give me three shillings.

ARTHUR

For the smell of your ale, the jingle

of his coins.

MORGANA

What did I see today in the wizard's

eyes? Censure, because I enjoy a few

words with a young handsome knight?

MERLIN

No, no, of course not. You are

young...

MERLIN

I'm not jealous!

MORGANA

It's clear you are, and it irks me.

MERLIN

No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want

to write poems about you with

moonbeams, make the sea sing your

name...

MORGANA

A lovestruck page!

MERLIN

Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me,

please... Morgana.

MORGANA

A steamy, panting, lovestruck page.

But what good are songs and poems to

me? They are the barter of ordinary

love. A gift that reflected your

greatness is the only one worthy of

your love.

MERLIN

I showed you all my conjuring

tricks...

MORGANA

The deepest secrets, the forbidden

formulas...

MERLIN

Maybe... maybe...

ARTHUR

Merlin, are you counselor to the

King, or to my sister?

MERLIN

At your service, sir.

ARTHUR

Then answer me this. For years peace

has reigned in the land. Crops grow

in abundance, there is no want. Every

one of my subjects enjoys his portion

of happiness and justice, even those

whose tiresome misunderstandings we

must resolve here each day. Tell me,

Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it

seems?

MERLIN

Good and evil; there is never one

without the other.

ARTHUR

Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?

MERLIN

Never where you expect it, that's

all I know.

SIR GAHALT

If we have peace and justice, why is

Lancelot never with us? Why is he

always riding out on his quests? He

must know where this evil is.

SIR GAWAIN

Could there be evil within Lancelot

himself? To live above human folly,

as is his aim, is to be overly proud.

SIR GAHALT

He pays no heed even to the Queens

longing for his company.

GUENEVERE

(lashing out)

What is it you would have your words

mean, Sir Gahalt?

MORGANA

Don't listen to him. You are the

Queen.

ARTHUR

Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.

GUENEVERE

No. I meant not to be angry with

you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness

that comes with peace gossip has

bread its own evil. You merely repeat

it. Please, sir, have one of those

apples that Lancelot loves, and in

that gesture partake of its goodness.

GUENEVERE

Take one, Sir Gahalt.

SIR GAHALT

I am most honored, my lady.

SIR GAWAIN

Hear me, Lord Arthur, and knights

and chieftains: I charge Guenevere

with the murder of my brother.

GUENEVERE

I didn't... I am innocent.

SIR GAWAIN

I champion this truth: That Queen

Guenevere murdered Sir Gahalt with

the aid of sorcery.

ARTHUR

The Queen will be in my charge till

a champion steps forward to fight on

her behalf.

GUENEVERE

Not you, my husband?

SIR GAWAIN

She must be burnt at the stake. That

is the sentence for murder done with

magic.

ARTHUR

It is. Lords and knights of the Round

Table, as her husband I say that

this deed was not done by Guenevere.

Who among you will champion this

truth?

ARTHUR

Sir Caradoc! You!

CARADOC

I am torn.

PERCEVAL

I will champion you, my lady.

GUENEVERE

I thank you, but you are not yet a

knight.

PERCEVAL

I will find Lancelot! He will come!

MERLIN

Boys!... boys will be boys...

PERCEVAL

I have found you. The Queen. An apple.

Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...

LANCELOT

--It must wait, child. These good

ladies, for whom I intervened once,

will honor me with a meal. I am

beholden to them now as I was when

they begged my protection.

GUENEVERE

Why can't you be my champion?

ARTHUR

If I am your judge, I cannot be your

champion. When I act as your King, I

cannot be your husband.

GUENEVERE

And you cannot love me...

ARTHUR

The laws, my laws, must bind everyone,

high and low, or they are not laws

at all. Lancelot will come...

GUENEVERE

And if he cannot be found, no other

knight will champion me, though you

beseeched each and every one of them.

Why be king if there is no one you

can call loyal subject but an eager

boy?

LANCELOT

Guenevere, I fight against myself...

ARTHUR

Is he coming?

PERCEVAL

He heard Lady Guenevere's request

and he said nothing. That is all.

SIR GAWAIN

My Lord, the sun is upon the field.

The Queen has no champion. I demand

justice, as is my right.

ARTHUR

So it is.

PERCEVAL

Let me champion the Queen!

SIR GAWAIN

(to Arthur)

Since no knight comes forward, I

demand justice--

ARTHUR

Boy, kneel.

ARTHUR

In the name of God, of St. Michael,

and St. George, I make you a knight.

Rise, Sir...

PERCEVAL

...Perceval!

LANCELOT

It's my task to prove the Queen's

innocence.

SIR GAWAIN

The Queen is innocent. I yield to

your mercy, Sir Lancelot.

MERLIN

Flesh on flesh. You must press on

the wound, Guenevere, hold it, and

it will begin to bind.

ARTHUR

Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere

is returned to me...

MERLIN

What is it my child?

ARTHUR

Will I have a son?

MERLIN

Yes.

ARTHUR

Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles,

nothing but a simple yes? That

frightens me.

MERLIN

A king should be afraid, always. The

enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush

in the dark corridors of his castle,

on the deer paths of his forest, or

in the gray and winding paths of a

more tangled forest, in here.

GUENEVERE

Flesh on flesh. I will heal you.

ARTHUR

They miss the battlefield. I think

we do too.

LANCELOT

But one can still keep a sword sharp

riding out in the name of the King's

law.

ARTHUR

It is not easy for the young ones to

learn knightly virtues without the

hard teaching of war and quest. It

is only your example, Lancelot, that

binds them now.

ARTHUR

Which is the greatest quality of

knighthood? Courage? Compassion?

Loyalty? Humility? What do you say,

Merlin?

MERLIN

What?

(then seeing he has

an audience)

The greatest? They blend together

like the metals we mix to make a

good sword.

ARTHUR

I didn't ask for poetry. Which is

it?

MERLIN

All right. Truth. It must be truth,

above all. When a man lies he murders

some part of the world.

LANCELOT

Conversation and court life don't

suit me. I must take my rest in the

forest.

ARTHUR

Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?

LANCELOT

It is deep...

ARTHUR

You will be sorely missed. Heal

yourself and come back.

LANCELOT

Why? You will destroy Arthur, and

us...

LANCELOT

The law forbids it.

GUENEVERE

Love demands it.

LANCELOT

There are things about love--

GUENEVERE

--Nothing!

LANCELOT

By my knight's sword, I swore faith--

LANCELOT

Guenevere...

ARTHUR

I am alone and betrayed. By my wife,

by my beloved friend, by my knights.

And by you. Perhaps most of all by

you. For you made me, you forged

this wretched life. And like a child

tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a

babbling lecher trotting after my

sister...

MERLIN

That is my destiny. I have a destiny,

too...

ARTHUR

With all your powers, you are content

to be ridiculed, laughed at...

MERLIN

My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to

cheap tricks...

(with sudden enthusiasm)

Yes! I enjoy every moment of my

foolishness, I join in the making of

it, so no one can betray me. But

you! You betray yourself.

ARTHUR

Me? I have lived by the oath of king

and knight.

MERLIN

You betray the boy who drew the sword,

the boy who saw the Dragon... the

Dragon who moves close by, coiling

and uncoiling, restless, looking

down, waiting for the King to be a

king...

ARTHUR

I must do it myself. I must kill

them both. Lancelot and Guenevere.

Will you ride with me, Merlin?

MERLIN

I cannot. I must not. Here I must

stay.

MORGANA

Crazy old fool. You think yourself a

kingmaker. Ha! A meddler, more likely.

Look what a mess you've made of

things.

MERLIN

I? Perhaps, perhaps. I'm losing

interest, Morgana... I have helped

men--or meddled in their affairs, if

you would have it that way--since

the dawn of time. Now let them live

by their own laws. Let them stand on

their own feet. The gods of once are

gone forever, it is time for men...

Morgana, make a man out of me. Kiss

me.

MORGANA

You know what I want. I want the

secret of true magic, how to thicken

the stuff of dreams and wishes with

the flesh of the world.

MERLIN

That I cannot.

MORGANA

Then I will not.

LANCELOT

Why didn't he kill us?

GUENEVERE

He has given up.

LANCELOT

The King without his sword, the land

without a king...

GUENEVERE

We are to blame.

MERLIN

When Arthur built the castle, I carved

out a place for myself, where I could

laugh or sleep, and no one would

bother me.

MORGANA

People make you laugh?

MERLIN

They do.

MORGANA

Why?

MERLIN

They don't know how close they live

to the edge of delight or disas...

MERLIN

Happiness or horror.

MERLIN

In the folds of the earth where the

forces that hold the world together

are more alive, my power is strongest.

Here I will possess you, as a man

possesses a woman. And the god, the

eunuch, the mule that I was, will be

no more.

MORGANA

You are truly magnificent!

MERLIN

Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant

of your stupid little games? Preying

on you weakness of others. That's

your power, a petty evil. Mine is

great. Great plans. Impossible dreams.

Laughable endings...

MORGANA

Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the

true Name of the charms of Doing and

Undoing. Show me!

MERLIN

I won't. You would misuse such power.

I have paid enough for you, and I

will have you.

MORGANA

Make magic, my foolish wizard. For

our love. Weave a marvelous room

around us, a room worthy of our

coupling.

MERLIN

What do you want? You must desire it

for me to weave it.

MORGANA

Walls of shining crystals, burning

with red fire, furnishings of metals

and jewels never seen by man...

MERLIN

Desire it and it will be as you

desire.

MORGANA

It's only a semblance. You disappoint

me.

MERLIN

Don't touch the walls. Come close to

me.

MORGANA

Do it, Merlin, the deepest secret.

Fix it with the charm of Making, for

our endless pleasure.

MERLIN

For you...

ARTHUR

Has no one seen Merlin?

KNIGHT

Did you see? The King was without

Excalibur...

MORGANA

I'll weep for you, brother, for a

King must not weep.

MORGANA

Do you know what Guenevere's maids

have whispered?

MORGANA

That when the King returned from

battle...

MORGANA

...Guenevere would unlace his armor

and massage the burns where metal

rubbed on flesh...

MORGANA

...She would prepare a bath for you,

mixing special ointment in the

water...

ARTHUR

Guenevere! You are--

"GUENEVERE"

--Don't speak. A thousand words, a

hundred thousand words, would only

be prologue to the truth that must

be. That you, King, and I, your Queen,

beget a son to bond our love and to

strengthen our weak kingdom with a

successor. Come, my lord...

MORGANA

The moon flows in my blood to meet

your seed. And already I bear him

who will be King.

MORGANA

I could easily kill you, brother.

But I want you to live to see our

son be King. In me, the blood of

Cornwall will have its revenge; in

me, the blood of Uther will show its

dark side.

MORGANA

Stand back, all of you. Through my

own body I have nurtured him with my

potions. I made him. I alone can

give him life.

ARTHUR

Who will ride the labyrinths of the

forest, to the very root of his soul,

to the very ends of the earth, to

find the secret that will redeem us

from the evil that has fallen upon

us, and make this chalice, and

ourselves, whole again?

SIR GAWAIN

I will ride forth in the name of

that quest, and commit my strength

and my soul to it.

PERCEVAL

I will go.

ARTHUR

Gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me,

that we may never meet again, that

the fellowship will be no more...

PERCEVAL

We will find the secret or die.

ARTHUR

Kay, I know your heart yearns to go,

but I am prisoner to my duties, and

you must be to yours, at my side.

FADE OUT:

MORGANA

(intoning)

The blood of this knight will feed

the god in the earth, he is weak

with hunger, and he will be made

strong by this blood. Then he will

plant his seed, and the land will be

fertile once again.

GAWAIN

Arthur, forgive me. I die without

the secret. I have failed.

MORGANA

Look, Mordred, a true prize for the

giant. The lamb rides into our jaws.

MORGANA

(to Mordred)

You must kill him, for this knight

is dear to your father. You must do

it and learn to enjoy your father's

pain.

MORGANA

Have you found what you search for?

Have you found what Arthur seeks?

MORGANA

You haven't, or you would be smiling

now in the face of death. Your quest

is an impossible one.

PERCEVAL

That it might be impossible makes it

all the more necessary.

MORGANA

Fool!

(to the men holding

Perceval)

Uncover him. I'll show you the mystery

of life. It's death...

(to Mordred)

Do it, Mordred!

MORGANA

Feel the life through the dagger,

child. It belongs to you.

MORDRED

I feel it, Mother. I will give his

blood to the giant.

MORGANA

You didn't kill him! You didn't kill

him!

MORGANA

My dear, sweet boy...

PERCEVAL

We'll become good friends.

LANCELOT

Where are you going, Lancelot, in

your iron tomb? Still trying to save

the world?

(He hammers blows

into Perceval's armor)

The best... the bravest... the

greatest... fool that ever lived.

Now the world rots. Death is king of

the earth. And it is you who make it

so, Lancelot.

FIGURE

What is the secret of the chalice?

Who does it serve?

PERCEVAL

The chalice. The secret was in my

grasp. I let it slip, afraid for

myself. A question was asked. I didn't

understand. I didn't try. I failed...

FADE OUT:

KAY

Your son Mordred is at the gate.

ARTHUR

At last...

KAY

Don't recognize him. You were trapped

by Morgana's sorcery.

ARTHUR

(staring off)

...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and

Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all

the others--lost to me. Only the

echo of their voices remains in this

empty hall. All I have left is the

memory of their fellowship. Echoes

and memories. I am a ghost of the

King that once was...

(he turns to Kay and

with sudden harshness)

...Mordred is real, alive, my own

flesh and blood. I will see him, I

must.

MORDRED

Father...

ARTHUR

Rise, Mordred.

MORDRED

I have come to claim what is mine,

Father.

ARTHUR

I recognize you only as my son, no

more.

MORDRED

(his tone is scathing)

And you are the great King? The lords

have rebelled. Invaders attack the

coasts. Crops don't grow. There is

nothing but plague and hunger in the

land. Only I am feared. I will be

king. You may have lost Excalibur,

but I have found my own weapon of

power. There.

MORDRED

The very spear that pierced the side

of Christ as he died on the cross.

ARTHUR

Your mother told you that?

ARTHUR

I cannot offer you the land, only my

love...

MORDRED

And I offer only this, Father. To

commit with passion and pleasure all

the evils that you failed to commit,

as man and king.

MORDRED

We will embrace only in battle.

Father, and I will touch you only

with the blade of my spear.

MORDRED

I will muster a great force of

knights, and I will return to fight

for what is mine.

ARTHUR

So be it.

PERCEVAL

Illusions. I will never find it

again... I am sorry, woman, that I

frightened you.

PERCEVAL

Good woman, do you have any food?

Some water?...

PEASANT

The little we had, we gave to

Mordred's knights. He has taken this

land. Tell the King that now we must

look to Mordred.

SECOND PEASANT

But we will give you some water...

PERCEVAL

I have lost my horse, my armor, my

sword. I have lost my way. I have

lost my strength. I have lost

everything... I will not lose hope.

FIGURE

Who does it serve?

PERCEVAL

You, my lord.

FIGURE

I have waited long for you. Once you

almost saw, but fear blinded you.

Why am I served from the chalice?

PERCEVAL

Because you and the land are one.

FIGURE

I am wasting away and I cannot die.

And I cannot live.

PERCEVAL

You and the land are one. Drink from

the chalice. You will be reborn and

the land with you.

FIGURE

But who am I?

PERCEVAL

You are my lord and King. You are

Arthur.

ARTHUR

I didn't know how empty was my soul

until it was filled.

KAY

Perceval, you have returned!

ARTHUR

Ready my knights for battle; they

will ride with their King once more.

I have lived through others far too

long! Lancelot carried my honor and

Guenevere my guilt. My knights have

fought my causes. Mordred carries my

sins. Now, at last, I will rule.

NUN

Go away. No man is allowed beyond

these doors.

ARTHUR

I am Arthur.

ARTHUR

Guenevere, accept my forgiveness,

and put your heart to rest. We have

suffered to long. I have always loved

you, and I still love you.

GUENEVERE

I loved you much, as King, and

sometimes as husband, but one cannot

gaze too long at the sun in the sky.

ARTHUR

Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I

was not born to live a man's life,

but to be the stuff of future memory.

The fellowship was a brief beginning,

a fair time that cannot be forgotten;

and because it will not be forgotten,

that fair time may come again. Now

once more I must ride with my knights

to defend what was, and the dream of

what could be.

GUENEVERE

I have kept it.

ARTHUR

I never dared to hope all these years

that it was in your keeping.

ARTHUR

I have often thought that in the

hereafter of our lives, when I owe

no more to the future and can be

just a man, that we may meet, and

you will come to me and claim me as

yours, and know that I am your

husband. It is a dream I have...

ARTHUR

Guenevere...

KNIGHT

It is only me and my son. All other

knights of the dukedom have rallied

to Mordred.

ARTHUR

What horror is that?

KNIGHT

Mordred, sir. He digs for precious

metals, with which he buys the loyalty

of men at arms, binding them to his

side.

ARTHUR

I am outnumbered ten to one by

Mordred's forces. Merlin, I need you

at my side as you were once, my

friend, to give me courage. There

are no war tricks that will fool

Mordred. He was weaned on blood.

ARTHUR

More than I ever did, I need you

now. Where are you, Merlin? Is it

true that Morgana has trapped you?

ARTHUR

...If only you could be at my side,

Merlin, to see me wield Excalibur

once more...

ARTHUR

What is this place? It is rumored

Merlin, that you drew your power

from these circles...

ARTHUR

Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they

must fight tomorrow for their very

lives.

MERLIN

I know. I have heard noises and echoes

through the stones...

ARTHUR

What is this place, Merlin?

MERLIN

It is like a tree. The roots of the

stones spread out across the land

and they draw on the thoughts and

actions of men. Like sap those human

matters course through the stones

feeding the stars that are the leaves

of the tree. And the stars whisper

back to men the future course of

events.

(becoming passionate)

But the earth is being torn apart,

its metals stolen, and the balance

is broken and the lines of power no

longer converge. In fact, I nearly

didn't make it in one piece.

MERLIN

But, I'm here.

ARTHUR

Where have you been these many years?

Is it true that Morgana--

MERLIN

--Stories... You brought me back.

Your love brought me back. Back to

where you are now, in the land of

dreams...

ARTHUR

Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!

ARTHUR

Merlin?!

KAY

Merlin, will I live...?

(he shakes away the

dream)

...I was dreaming...

ARTHUR

Of Merlin?

KAY

Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would

fight bravely tomorrow. I have never

dreamed of Merlin before.

ARTHUR

I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives!

He lives in our dreams now, in that

dark and shadowy place that is as

strong and real as this more solid

one. He speaks to us from there.

MERLIN

I have returned, enchantress. You

are beautiful, magnificent. Have you

used up all the magic you stole from

me to keep yourself young? Have you

any magic left to do battle with

Merlin?

MORGANA

You provoke me, Merlin.

MERLIN

What's behind that beauty? A wizened,

cold-hearted snake.

MERLIN

You are a snake about to strike!

MERLIN

And I am the staff that drives the

snake back.

MORGANA

Burning with the fire of desire, I

am the flames that consume the staff

to ashes.

MERLIN

I am the cloudburst that quenches

the flames.

MORGANA

I am the desert, where water

disappears--

MERLIN

--I am the sea, which covers the

desert forever under its weight.

MORGANA

--I am the fog and mists that rise

up from the sea, escaping...

MERLIN

Fog and mist! You couldn't be that.

You don't have enough magic.

MORGANA

...I have the desire and I have the

magic...

MERLIN

You are mine at last. I am the sea

and you will never escape me. Fog

and Mist...!?

LIEUTENANT

A fog is rising, sir.

MORDRED

That cannot be.

MORDRED

(to the lieutenant)

My mother has a sense for such things.

She said there would be no fog.

MORDRED

...Mother?

ARTHUR

Kay, you will lead the attack.

Perceval, you will stay with me.

ARTHUR

Be cautious, my brother.

ARTHUR

In this battle there is one thing I

must do, that no one else can. Find

Mordred and kill him.

PERCEVAL

There are too many on Mordred's side.

We cannot hold out much longer.

KAY

He can be no other.

ARTHUR

Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!

PERCEVAL

No, my lord. We seek Mordred.

KAY

I will join him.

ARTHUR

Has anyone seen Lancelot?

SQUIRE

He lies over there, sir.

ARTHUR

Squire! Here!

LANCELOT

Arthur.

ARTHUR

Lancelot, I will save you... Don't

die.

LANCELOT

My salvation is to die a Knight of

the Round Table.

ARTHUR

You are that and much more. You are

its greatest knight, you are what is

best in men. Now we will be together--

LANCELOT

--It is the old wound, that has been

opened. I have always known it would

be the gateway to my death, for it

has never healed. Let my heart do

its job, my King, and pump me empty...

LANCELOT

(a death whisper)

Guenevere, has she come to you, is

she Queen again?

ARTHUR

She is, Lancelot.

PERCEVAL

The fog is lifting. Only we remain

alive.

ARTHUR

But for Mordred. Where is Mordred?

MORDRED

Where is Arthur?

ARTHUR

No, Perceval. Now it is time for me

to raise my sword.

(he bellows out)

Mordred, prepare to meet your death.

MORDRED

I wait for you, Father.

ARTHUR

Draw the spear from me. Do it.

ARTHUR

There is one thing left to do...

Excalibur... And you must do it,

Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command

you.

PERCEVAL

I cannot--

ARTHUR

--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of

calm water and throw the sword into

it.

ARTHUR

Obey me, Perceval. You must act for

me. It is my last order as your King.

Do it, and be back!

PERCEVAL

It is too precious a thing. I can't...

ARTHUR

When you threw it in, what did you

see?

PERCEVAL

...I saw nothing.

PERCEVAL

My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur

cannot be lost. Other men--

ARTHUR

--By itself it is only a piece of

steel. Its power comes from he who

wields it. For now there is no one.

Do as I have ordered!

PERCEVAL

Arthur!

PERCEVAL

Arthur! Will you return?

PERCEVAL

All the knights of the Round Table

are dead. Excalibur is returned.

Arthur is gone. Maybe he lives, maybe

he will return...

PERCEVAL

Only I remain, and this...

FADE OUT:

THE END
