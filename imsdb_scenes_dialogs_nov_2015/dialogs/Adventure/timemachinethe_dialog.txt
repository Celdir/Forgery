Screenplay

by

DAVID DUNCAN

FADE OUT:

Out of the SILENT darkness a short white       A

fluted column surmounted by a SUNDIAL

appears.  It floats in, waveringly, until

it becomes clearly visible, then drifts

off as though moving in some huge orbit.

Next an HOURGLASS floats in from the left      B

of the screen.  The faint HISSING OF

RUNNING SAND breaks the stillness of space.

As the hourglass glides across the screen,     C

it is met by a GREEK WATER CLOCK accompanied

by the sound OF DRIPPING WATER.

A MEDIEVAL CLOCK with weights arises as its    D

horizontal escapement TICKS LOUDLY.  Mean-

while the sundial, hourglass and water clock

return, drifting at diverse angles across

the screen.

A FIGURE wheels past, with the face of a       E

clock and the body carved like a drummer

of the 14th century, BEATING the hour.

A SMALL CLOCK bears a golden angel with        F

hammer in hands as it STRIKES A BELL.

ANOTHER TIMEPIECE, with CHIMES, floats in      G

to mingle with all the drifting objects.

The BIG BEN is TOLLING                         H

Then a GREAT BELL.                             J

THE TIME MACHINE

"THE LAND OF THE LEAL"

Words & Music by Peggy Lee

When I was a wee lad                               L

And dark was the night

Afraid I would be

Til the bright morning light

And sometimes...for comfort

Away I would steal Away

I would go to the Land of the Leal.

And soon I would be there

It took me no time

My heart would be soaring

As I made the climb

And there was the green grass

So cool and so sweet

So good to be run through

With happy bare feet!

And who was my teacher

And how did I know?

Just when to be going

And which way to go?

But always when wishing

Away I would steal

Away I would go to the Land of the Leal.

And now that I'm older

I try to be wise

But when I am troubled

I still close my eyes

And just like the wee lad

Away I will steal

Away I will go to the Land of the Leal.

For there are no questions

And there are no lies

And never a storm there

To darken the skies

The birds who are flying

No freer they feel

Than I

When I live in the land of the Leal.

FADE OUT:

DR. PHILIP HILLYER is an imposing            (a)

businessman, wearing full sideburns.

He stares stonily at the last empty

chair, then at Filby with annoyance.

ANTHONY BRIDEWELL, a man of the world,       (b)

impeccably attired in the latest fashion,

welcomes Filby the only way he knows, by

lifting his glass of whiskey.

WALTER KEMP, a middle aged man with keen     (c)

black piercing eyes, angrily chews on

his Havana.

Filby fidgets uncomfortably in his chair     (d)

as

Hillyer glances impatiently at his           (e)

watch, comparing time with a GRAND-

FATHER CLOCK behind him, then snaps

it shut and glares at:

DR. HILLYER

I say, this is outright rude of the man!

FILBEY

He's undoubtedly been detained.  That's

all.

KEMP (unscrews the cigar from

his tight lips)

This is such a confounded waste of

time!  If he's not coming, I've any

number of more important things to do.

DR. HILLYER

Speak up -- what is it, woman?

BRIDEWELL

Well...are we or are we not invited

to dinner?

FILBY (reading)

Apparently we are.

(to Mrs. Watchett)

How long has he been gone?

MRS. WATCHETT (nervously)

I can't rightly say, sir. - Several

days...I hardly catch a glimpse of

him lately.  He never leaves the

laboratory and comes out only to

nibble at his meals...but he did tell

me days ago about dinner tonight and

left these instructions.

(pointing to note)

FILBY

Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

DR. HILLYER (indicating the

note)

What does it say, Filby?  What's

wrong?

FILBY

Nothing really. - George merely says

that if he is not here by eight we're

to begin without him.

MRS. WATCHETT

Dinner is served, gentlemen!

BRIDEWELL (puts his glass

down)

First sensible thing I've heard all

evening.

FILBY

This is peculiar.  He is usually very

prompt, precise and punctual.

DR. HILLYER

He's making fools of us by inviting

us here and then not showing up.

It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

KEMP

To say nothing of the waste of

time.

DR. HILLYER (agreeing)

To say nothing of the waste of

time.

BRIDWELL (arises, lifting

his glass)

One thing I will say for George, he

keeps the best cellar in the south of

England...and Mrs. Watchett is the

finest cook in the world. - I think

I'll drink to that!

MRS. WATCHETT (frightened)

There!...there...

FILBY

Good lord! - What's happened?

TIME TRAVELLER

I'm all right...just some food...a

drink...

TIME TRAVELLER

Are you all right?

BRIDEWELL (a delayed

answer)

Of course.  I'm...all right...

MRS. WATCHETT (half

apology, half concern)

I didn't recognize you!...it was

so dark...

TIME TRAVELLER

Meat...I'm hungry for meat!

DR. HILLYER

Well, can't you speak, man?  What

happened to you?  Aren't you going

to tell us...

BRIDEWELL

Leave him alone, can't you?

TIME TRAVELLER (swallowing)

It's all right. - I want to tell.

FILBY

It will keep, George.  Eat, rest a

little.

TIME TRAVELLER

No!  I must tell it now... while I

still remember.

FILBY

Relax, try to relax a bit.  You've

all the time in the world.

TIME TRAVELLER

You're right, David.

(almost to himself)

That's exactly what I have. -

All the time in the world!...

ever since we were all together

five days ago, the last day of

Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine.

SLOWLY DISSOLVE:

should give the effect of the Ebony Box

emerging from the Time Traveller's brain.)

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

There in that box rests the result

of two years' labor.

TIME TRAVELLER

(continues)

I wanted to finish the job before

the new century began. - I barely

made it.

BRIDEWELL

Marvelous.

DR. HILLYER (stands up)

What is it?

TIME TRAVELLER

Well, it has to do with time.

DR. HILLYER

(steps to box)

I've always maintained what this

nation needs is a reliable timepiece.

The Navy needs one. The Army needs

one. - For the artillery you know.

KEMP (leaning forward)

Couldn't do better, George.  So

that's why you've been in hiding. -

Clever of you, indeed!

FILBY (studying the Time

Traveller's reaction)

I don't believe George is referring

to a new kind of timepiece.

TIME TRAVELLER

When I speak of time, I'm referring

to the fourth dimension.

FILBY

Go on, George.

TIME TRAVELLER

Now, as you know, the difficulty

in explaining the fourth dimension

is that it cannot be seen or felt -

it must be thought of.

FILBY

If you don't mind, George, would

you refresh me on the first three

dimensions.

DR. HILLYER

Really, Filby, they must have

taught you something at school!

BRIDEWELL (baiting

Dr. Hillyer)

Suppose you explain it, Doctor.

DR. HILLYER

Certainly!

(he demonstrates

pompously)

When I move in a straight line,

forward or backward, that's one

dimension. - When I move to the

left or right, two dimensions. -

When I move up and down, three

dimensions.

(a bright idea lights up

his face.  At last he can

get ahold of the box, but

Filby interferes before

Dr. Hillyer can get his

fingers on it and he has

to be satisfied with merely

pointing)

For instance, this box has three

dimensions:  length, breadth, and

height.

BRIDEWELL (amazed)

Well, then, what's the fourth

dimension?

DR. HILLYER

Well, that's...that's mere theory!

No one can really say what the

fourth dimension is or even that

it exists.

TIME TRAVELLER

On the contrary, Doctor!  The

fourth dimension is as true and as

real a dimension as any of the

other three.  In fact, they couldn't

exist without it.

DR. HILLYER (enters the SHOT)

How do you mean?

TIME TRAVELLER

Well, take that box.  It has the

first three dimensions, as you said.

But what if it didn't exist in Time?

It wouldn't exist at all, would it?

DR. HILLYER

No.

TIME TRAVELLER

So - for an object to exist at all,

it must exist in the fourth dimen-

sion....and that fourth dimension

is duration....Time!

DR. HILLYER (impatiently)

All right!  But what's in that box?

TIME TRAVELLER

I'm coming to that.  But first,

consider!  Why is it that we usually

ignore the fourth dimension?  Because

we have no freedom to move in it.  We

can move in the other three -- up,

down, forward, backward, sideways.

But when it comes to Time, we are

prisoners.  Do you follow me, Anthony?

KEMP

George!  You've given a most lucid

explanation and all that!  But I

don't think I entirely understand.

TIME TRAVELLER

Look!  There are a lot of things in

the world you don't understand,

aren't there?

KEMP

Of course!  Quite a number.

TIME TRAVELLER

But you don't refuse to believe

in them because of that?

KEMP

Not if I can see the proof with

my own eyes.

TIME TRAVELLER

Good!  All I'm asking you to do

now is to witness a demonstration

of the possibility of movement in

the fourth dimension.

(to Dr. Hillyer)

Philip, will you please hand me

that box?

TIME TRAVELLER

I've told you.  The larger model

can carry a passenger on a journey

through Time. - Not through Space,

mind you, but through Time.

BRIDEWELL

Oh, I say George!  If you start

floating around in the future, aren't

you likely to mess things up for the

rest of us?

DR. HILLYER

The future is already there.  It's

irrevocable and cannot be changed.

TIME TRAVELLER

That's the most important question

to which I hope to find an answer.

Can Man control his destiny?  Can he

change the shape of things to come?

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

Imagine that this cigar is the Time

Traveller.  Now, this lever in front

of him controls movement.  Forward

pressure sends the Machine into the

future, backward pressure into the

past.  And the harder the pressure

the faster the Machine travels.

TIME TRAVELLER

This experiment can be performed

only once.  If it succeeds, I lose

my model forever.  That is why I

need witnesses.

KEMP

Go ahead.

TIME TRAVELLER

You're ready then?

TIME TRAVELLER

Doctor Hillyer, would you care

to lend me your hand?

The glasses on the silver tray rattle        (a)

and clink against each other.

The gas lights of the chandelier             (b)

flicker rapidly.

A vase shudders and moves slightly on        (c)

the mantelpiece.

DR. HILLYER (touches his

cigar pocket)

I'll be damned!

TIME TRAVELLER (almost

to himself)

It worked!

30 OUT

DR. HILLYER

Where did it go?

TIME TRAVELLER (recovering)

Go?  Nowhere in the usual sense.

It's still here.

(indicating space where the

Machine stood)

But it's no longer in the present.

It's traveling through time - to

the future, to be precise.

DR. HILLYER

Do you seriously expect us to

believe that?

TIME TRAVELLER

Certainly.

DR. HILLYER

But you just said it hasn't

really moved.

TIME TRAVELLER

That's correct.

DR. HILLYER

Then why can't we see it?

TIME TRAVELLER

Because we're in this room on

December 31st, 1899, while the

model you saw is perhaps a hundred

years away.  This room, or even

this house, may no longer exist a

hundred years from now.  But the

Time Machine is occupying the same

space it did a moment before it went

off on its journey.

DR. HILLYER (exasperated)

If it occupies the same space, I

should be able to feel it.

TIME TRAVELLER

You must remember that the space

you've just put your hand through

is today's space.  You can't put

your hand into the space of

tomorrow.

DR. HILLYER (getting angry)

Space is space!  It doesn't change!

The same space that is here now should

be here a hundred or even a thousand

years from now.

TIME TRAVELLER

No!  Time changes space.  This flat

ground we're standing on now could

have been at the bottom of the sea

a million years ago.  And a million

years from now it could be the

interior of a huge mountain.

KEMP

Suppose what you say is true.

Exactly what do you suggest we do

with such a contraption?

TIME TRAVELLER

For my part, I intend to take a

journey into the future. - Unless

someone else prefers to volunteer.

BRIDEWELL (chuckling)

I say, George.  Suppose you go off

and get lost in the fiftieth century!

How will you find your way back?

TIME TRAVELLER (quite

serious)

That's a calculated risk I'm prepared

to take.

DR. HILLYER

Now listen, George!  I don't

know what you take us for, but

we're not fools.  There are a

number of ways of doing a

disappearing trick!  But a man of

your ability should not bother

with such nonsense.

DR. HILLYER (unable to

resist the temptation for

sarcasm)

There's a war on, you know!  The

Boers are putting up a pretty stiff

fight in South Africa and our

country needs inventors like you.

I can put you in touch with the

War Office if you wish.

TIME TRAVELLER (looks

up at Filby)

What do you think?

FILBY (hesitating

slightly, and then)

I think Dr. Hillyer has a point,

George.

DR. HILLYER

Now you're being sensible.  I'll

take care of it first thing in

the New Year.

DR. HILLYER

Well, time to go.

KEMP

Yes, we all have our plans for

tonight.

BRIDEWELL (concerned)

Are you all right, George?

TIME TRAVELLER

Of course, I am.

DR. HILLYER'S VOICE

Coming, Bridewell?

TIME TRAVELLER

Thanks for coming.

AD LIBS

Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George -

Happy Twentieth Century. - Etc.

DR. HILLYER

Come on, Bridewell.

FILBY

I thought I'd better stay.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

You needn't have troubled yourself.

I'm all right.

FILBY

No you're not. - You've been

behaving oddly for over a month

now.

(and then)

I'm not leaving until you tell me

what's on your mind.

TIME TRAVELLER

I appreciate your gesture, David,

but if you don't mind I'd rather

you left me alone.

FILBY

You have changed, George.

Enormously.

TIME TRAVELLER

I'm sorry.

FILBY (looks up to him

directly)

Will you answer me one question

honestly?

TIME TRAVELLER

I'll try.

FILBY

Why this preoccupation with Time?

TIME TRAVELLER (sharply)

Why not?

FILBY

Don't go simple on me, George!

TIME TRAVELLER (a beat,

then calmly)

If you want to know the truth, I

don't much care for the time I was

born into. - It seems people aren't

dying fast enough these days.  They

call upon science to invent new,

more efficient weapons to depopulate

the earth.

FILBY

I quite agree with you.  But here

we are and we have to make the best

of it.

TIME TRAVELLER

You may have to.  I don't.

FILBY (making a half-

hearted attempt at levity)

All right.  Take a journey on your

contraption.  What would you become?...

A Greek?  A Roman?  One of the

Pharaohs?

TIME TRAVELLER

I prefer the future.

FILBY

You're not seriously saying you can

do it?

TIME TRAVELLER

You saw the experiment this afternoon,

didn't you?

FILBY

I saw a toy machine vanish.  But

I'm certain there are a number of

ways of doing that trick.  Any

magician at the Hippodrome could

probably do it.

TIME TRAVELLER (angrily)

It was no trick! - Would you care

to see the full-scale model?

FILBY

No, I would not!  I have no desire

to tempt the laws of Providence and

I don't think you should.  It's not

for man to trifle with.

TIME TRAVELLER

Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp.

FILBY

There is something in their common

sense attitude to life.

(and then)

George, I speak to you as a friend.

More, as a brother.  If that machine

can do what you say it can...destroy

it.  Destroy it, George, before it

destroys you.

TIME TRAVELLER

You must have plans for New Year's

Eve.  Don't let me keep you.

FILBY

Mary isn't well.  We decided to

stay home with the baby.  But why

don't you come home with me.  You

haven't seen little Jaime for a

long time.

TIME TRAVELLER

I can't.

FILBY

What's stopping you?

TIME TRAVELLER

I just want to see the old century

out by myself.

FILBY (rising)

Have it your own way.

FILBY

Will you promise me that you won't

leave the house tonight?

TIME TRAVELLER

I promise you, I won't walk out of

the door.

TIME TRAVELLER

David!  Please don't think me un-

friendly! - Come over to dinner -

next Friday.  Won't you?

FILBY

Very well.

TIME TRAVELLER

Fine...and will you bring the others

with you?

FILBY (with a warm smile)

Whatever you say, George. - Happy

New Year.

TIME TRAVELLER (shaking hands)

And a very happy New Year to you, David.

MRS. WATCHETT

Will you be having supper in this

evening, sir?

TIME TRAVELLER (while ex-

changing jackets with Mrs.

Watchett's help)

I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.  Why

don't you take the evening off and

celebrate.

MRS. WATCHETT

Thank you, sir, but if you won't be

needing me I think I'll turn in early

and get some sleep...

(indicating revelers outside)

...it I can. - Goodnight, sir.

TIME TRAVELLER

Goodnight.

TIME TRAVELLER

Oh, Mrs. Watchett!

(as she responds)

I've invited Mr. Filby and the others

to dinner next Friday.

(and then)

Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.

MRS. WATCHETT

Happy New Year, sir.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

I started...and the laboratory grew

faint around me...

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

...I stopped.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

No change; everything exactly as it

bad been before. - But no!

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (excited)

The clock said 9:31 when I started and

now it was 11:O9...and the candle,

shorter by inches.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

And yet by my watch which was in the

machine with me, only a few seconds

had passed.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

It was disconcerting to see the sun...

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

...arc in less than a minute...

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

....to see flowers closing their eyes

for the night, changes that normally

took hours, occuring in seconds, was

beautiful.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

And as yet I was travelling very slowly!

(challenging)

What if I went faster?!

The sun hops swiftly across the sky.    (a)

The night falls and the stars circle    (b)

the North Star.

The sun appears and disappears be-      (c)

hind the whirling clouds.

At night the moon races through         (d)

tumultuous clouds.

On the following day the sky darkens    (e)

with thunderheads.  There is a

cataract of lightning and THUNDER.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

It became intoxicating.  To see an

entire storm in a few seconds. -

So I pushed the lever on toward

even greater speed.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

Thirteen years had passed...fourteen...

fifteen...sixteen...and then...

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

In the year nineteen hundred seventeen...

I stopped.

distinctive landmarks that will stay

recognizable during his journey into

the future, thereby giving a clear

conception that time-travelling does

not involve geographical movement.

For instance, the sharp curve of the

River Thames in the distance will

remain even after the house itself

has disappeared.)

TIME TRAVELLER (glibly)

Going to a masquerade, David?  You

look rather silly without your

moustache, old man!

FILBY (puzzled)

Were you addressing me, sir?

TIME TRAVELLER

(positively)

Filby!  I expected more of an

enthusiastic greeting from...

FILBY (smiles as he

interrupts)

I'm afraid you have me confused

with my father, sir.  There was a

remarkable resemblance. - I'm

James Filby.

TIME TRAVELLER

Was?

JAMES FILBY

Were you a friend of father's?

TIME TRAVELLER

Yes...yes...I've been away.

JAMES FILBY

He was killed in the war...a year

ago.

TIME TRAVELLER (aghast)

No!...it can't be...

(then, as he realizes its

truth)

I'm sorry to hear that.

(pause, then hesitantly

points)

And the gentleman who used to live

across the street?

JAMES FILBY

Oh, him.  Some inventor who

disappeared around the turn of the

century. - If you're interested in

that house, forget it.  You can't

buy it or even go inside.

TIME TRAVELLER

Why is that?

JAMES FILBY

My father was executor of the

inventor's estate and he refused to

liquidate it.

(adds with a smile)

I often chided him on that account,

but he felt positive that the owner

would return some day. - Some people

hereabouts think it's haunted.

(stares at Time Traveller

curiously, studying the

strange cut of his clothes)

Who are you, sir?

TIME TRAVELLER

Just a stranger who once knew your

father.

JAMES FILBY

I see.

(still curious at the Time

Traveller's abstract attitude)

Have you been at the front, sir?

TIME TRAVELLER

Front?  What front?

JAMES FILBY

Why the war, of course.

TIME TRAVELLER

What war?

JAMES FILBY

Great heavens, man, don't you know

we've been at war with Germany

since nineteen fourteen?  I thought

perhaps you had seen action in

France...or maybe...

(noticing confusion, adds

with a note of compassion)

Perhaps a cup of tea would make

you feel better.  Won't you come in?

TIME TRAVELLER

No...no, thank you.

JAMES FILBY

You're sure you're alright, sir?

TIME TRAVELLER

Yes, I'm quite alright.

JAMES FILBY (hesitantly)

Then...goodbye, sir.

TIME TRAVELLER

Goodbye, Jaime.

DISSOLVE TO:

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

As I went along, I gained experience

in handling the Machine.  I found

that I could stop for a day, an hour,

or even for a second to observe, then

go ahead for a year or two. - Thus I

was able to see the changing world

in a series of glimpses.

TIME TRAVELLER

Good heavens, that's a dress?

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

This was intriguing.  I wondered

just how far women would permit

this to go.

BLUR TO:

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

I began to grow fond of that

mannequin.  Maybe because, like me,

she didn't age.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

Suddenly, in nineteen forty I began

to be buffeted from side to side.

My first thought was that the Machine

had a mechanical defect or a part

had worn out.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

The last time I had stopped was in

nineteen seventeen, twenty three years

ago.  And the war with Germany was

still waging - now in the air with

flying machines.  It didn't seem

possible they could go on fighting

all these years and still have the

means of fighting.  Then I realized

the truth of the matter.  This was a

new war.  There must have been an

interval of peace in between these

wars.  Yet they had learned nothing

but to prepare even more effective

means of destroying one another.  I

decided to push on into time and see

the outcome.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

The fighting in the sky lasted only

a few moments.  By nineteen forty five

it was over, but I continued on a

few more years before pausing for

another glimpse of my silent, never

aging friend.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

It vas reassuring to find that she

hadn't changed.  Only her costume.

Provocative to say the least.  I

wondered what she would look like

ten years hence.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

At first I wondered if my Machine and

I were the cause of the panic.  I was

to soon find out we weren't.

TIME TRAVELLER

(shakes his head)

I can't understand you.

WARDEN

(looking at helmet)

Confounded radio in this thing.

Makes more noise than it does sense.

TIME TRAVELLER

(recognizing him)

Filby!

WARDEN

My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't

you hear the air raid siren?

TIME TRAVELLER

You mean that horrible screeching?

WARDEN

It wasn't constructed for its

aesthetic values, you know, but to

warn silly young fools like yourself

to get down into the shelter.  Now

go on.

TIME TRAVELLER

But I'm perfectly comfortable and

I find your store magnificent.  What

splendid achievements, what gigantic

strides mankind has taken, what...

WARDEN

(interrupting)

Come on, young man.  We'd better be

going before the mushrooms start

sprouting.

(looks at Time Traveller

with renewed interest)

You do look familiar.  Haven't

we met somewhere before?

TIME TRAVELLER

Indeed we have.  Right here.  Many

years ago.

WARDEN

I was sure of that, but the exact

time escapes me.

TIME TRAVELLER

It was two wars ago, I believe.

Nineteen seventeen.

WARDEN (awed)

Why now I recall.  The chap who

inquired about my father -- and

the house that used to be across

the way.

(stops and stares at

the Time Traveller)

But no...that's impossible.  You

haven't changed.  You're not a day

older.  And your clothes...

TIME TRAVELLER

I'm afraid it's going to take me

a little time to explain... You see...

WARDEN

The last alert...hurry!

TIME TRAVELLER

Listen to me!  It's important.

WARDEN (points to sky)

Look!  An atomic satellite zeroing

in!  That's important!!

WARDEN

Hurry!  Hide 'til the All Clear!

TIME TRAVELLER

All clear?

(yells)

I've got to talk to you.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

The labor of centuries gone in an

instant.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

But then Mother Earth, aroused by man's

violence, responded with volcanic

violence or her own!

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

Then I saw my own danger.  I too was

to be engulfed!

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

But to go back was unthinkable.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

Only my speed through time saved me

from being roasted alive and encased

in stone forever.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

The molten rock cooled.

(he closes his burning

eyes as the last of the

light vanishes)

I prayed...wondering how many centuries,

how many eons must pass before the wind

and rain could wear away the mountain

that enclosed me.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

(whispering)

Darkness...darkness for centuries.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

I wondered if there was still war

being waged on the ground above me...

if man would still exist on earth,

when I saw the sun again.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

The centuries rolled by. - I put

my trust in time and waited for

the rock to wear down around me.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

I was free again!

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

Thousands of centuries passed, but

the earth stayed green!  There was

no winter!  No wars! - Had man finally

learned to control both the elements

and themselves? - I had to stop and

find out.

SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

TIME TRAVELLER (to himself)

At last I've found a Paradise.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

Nature tamed completely and more

bountiful than ever before.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

Flowers everywhere...the whole landscape

one vast garden with no sign of weeds or

briars.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

(surprised)

Unrepaired for centuries!  Maybe

unlived in for as long.

(then)

It would be no Paradise if it

belonged to me alone.

TIME TRAVELLER (shouting)

Anyone here?

TIME TRAVELLER (musingly,

to himself)

So this is man's future...

TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)

...to bask in the sunlight, bathe in

the clear streams and eat the fruits

of earth with all knowledge of work

and hardship forgotten.

TIME TRAVELLER

Well, and why not?

TIME TRAVELLER

Help her!...

TIME TRAVELLER

Are you all right?

DISSOLVE TO:

THE GIRL

Why did you?

TIME TRAVELLER

Why did I what?

THE GIRL

Come after me.

TIME TRAVELLER (ironic)

I did it to save your life, young

lady, which I'm afraid doesn't hold

much meaning for you or anyone else.

THE GIRL (simply)

It doesn't.

TIME TRAVELLER

Must have been fifty of your friends

watching you drown.  Not one of

them so much as lifted a finger. -

(shakes his head)

A curious attitude - in a curious

world.

(a pause, then a

smile)

Aren't you the least bit interested

in what I am...where I come from?

THE GIRL (innocently)

Should I be?

TIME TRAVELLER (smiles)

Perhaps you'd better take me to

someone a bit older I can talk to.

THE GIRL

There is no one older.

TIME TRAVELLER

Doesn't anyone age in this land

of yours?

TIME TRAVELLER

What's your name?

THE GIRL

Weena.

TIME TRAVELLER

How do you spell that?

WEENA

Spell?

TIME TRAVELLER

Write!  - Can't you write?  Look!

TIME TRAVELLER

And what are your people called?

WEENA (as if he ought to know)

Eloi.

WEENA

Come.  We must go in.

TIME TRAVELLER (rising)

Why?  What's wrong?

WEENA (anxiously)

It is getting dark.

TIME TRAVELLER (directed to

Young Man, but meant for the

entire group)

I don't mind telling you, I'm quite

hungry.  I've come a long, long way.

TIME TRAVELLER

In my time a berry this size would

have made news in every civilized

country.

TIME TRAVELLER

Sir, perhaps curiosity has died.

Perhaps even courtesy has died, but

I have come a long way and there are

things I would like to know.

YOUNG MAN (considers a

moment, then)

Why?

TIME TRAVELLER

Because I shall return to my time

and they will ask questions such as

what kind of government rules your

world.

MAN IN WHITE

We have no government.

TIME TRAVELLER (speaking

as though to a child)

You must have a body of men who pass

and enforce laws.

MAN IN WHITE

There are no laws.

TIME TRAVELLER (taken aback,

then)

How do you get your food and clothing?

TIME TRAVELLER

Doesn't anyone work?

MAN IN WHITE

No.

TIME TRAVELLER (picks up

fruit)

Then where does this come from?

MAN IN WHITE

It grows.  It always grows.

TIME TRAVELLER

But it must be planted, cultivated,

nurtured...unless...

(with mistaken insight as he

observes no reaction to this

last query)

Unless you have an economy so well

organized that you can devote all your

time to study and experimentation.

Am I right?

MAN IN WHITE

You ask many questions.

TIME TRAVELLER (annoyed)

Yes!  And I'm not ashamed of it.

That is how man has learned and

bettered himself.  I must learn about

you and your civilization.  You have

books, don't you?

YOUNG MAN (recognizing a

half-forgotten word)

Books. - Books!  Yes, we have books.

TIME TRAVELLER

Books will tell me what I want to

know.  Books will tell me all about

you.

TIME TRAVELLER

Yes...they do tell me all about you!

TIME TRAVELLER

What have you done?  Thousands of

years of building and rebuilding

creating and re-creating so that

you can let it crumble to dust.

TIME TRAVELLER

A million yesterdays of sensitive

men dying for their dreams.  For

what?  So you can swim and dance

and play.

TIME TRAVELLER

I am returning to my time!  Not to

tell of the uselessness of the

struggle - not to tell of the

hopeless future - but only so that

I can die among men!

DISSOLVE TO:

where the Time Traveller's house once stood.)

WEENA

I heard you pounding...I came to

tell you...

TIME TRAVELLER

How do you open that panel?

WEENA

No one opens it.  Only the Morlocks.

TIME TRAVELLER

Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?

TIME TRAVELLER

Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?

TIME TRAVELLER

Tell me.

WEENA

When they call, we must go below.

TIME TRAVELLER

Do the Morlocks live beneath the

earth?

(Weena nods)

Why must you obey their command?

WEENA

They give us the food we eat, the

clothes we wear.  We must do as

they command.

TIME TRAVELLER

What happens to your people when

they go below?

WEENA (repressing an in-

voluntary shudder)

No one knows.  No one has ever

returned.

TIME TRAVELLER (smiling

at her warmly, reassuringly)

It won't happen to you.

WEENA

It is night.

TIME TRAVELLER

Only children are frightened by

the dark. - But then you are a

child, aren't you?

(Weena glances around

warily into the shadows,

her anxiety mounting)

I'll build a fire.

WEENA (taking his

hand, rises)

Let us go from here.

TIME TRAVELLER (getting

up)

I can't, child.

(walking toward the sphinx)

My Machine is inside there, I

intend to wait here 'til morning,

then find some way of getting

inside.

WEENA (catching up)

No, you must not.

TIME TRAVELLER (stops,

then)

Help me gather some wood.

WEENA

Where are you from?

TIME TRAVELLER (picks

up dry branches)

As a matter of fact, I'm from

right here.

(gesturing)

There's where my house stood many

thousands of years ago.  Here - to

that monument, was my laboratory.

About there was my library where I

once sat talking with friends about

my Time Machine.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

(continuing)

I hoped to learn a great deal.  I

hoped to take back the knowledge,

the advancement, mankind made...

instead what do I find?  Vegetables!

TIME TRAVELLER (continuing)

The human race reduced to living

vegetables!

TIME TRAVELLER

Get me a few more twigs.

TIME TRAVELLER

(after calming her)

What was it?

WEENA (low)

Morlocks.

TIME TRAVELLER (strikes

match and holds it to twigs)

This seems to keep them away.

TIME TRAVELLER (while

examining her hand)

What ever made you put your hand in

the fire?

WEENA

I never saw it before.

TIME TRAVELLER

(after a long silence)

Do you know that the first thing

which separated man from the rest

of the mammals was his knowledge of

fire?

(he looks at her)

No, I suppose you don't.

(pokes at fire)

The next great stride came with

the discovery of the wheel.

(turns to her)

Do you know what that is?

(she shakes her head)

I'm sorry I was angry with your

people.  I had no right to be.

No more than if I had visited the

Island of Bali in my own time.

You were safe inside your great

house, yet you came out into the

night to warn me.  The one

characteristic which distinguished

man from the animal kingdom was the

spirit of self sacrifice.  You have

that quality, Girl.  I'm sure all

of your people have it.  All it

requires is someone to reawaken it.

I shall try if you'll let me.  Will

you?

WEENA

I do not understand you, but I

believe you.

TIME TRAVELLER

That's a good start. - Now try to

tell me...who or what are the Morlocks?

(Weena looks at him blankly)

Are they people or animals?

(her expression remains unchanged)

What do you know about yourself?  The

past?  Don't your people ever speak

of the past?

WEENA

There is no past.

TIME TRAVELLER

Don't you ever wonder about the future?

WEENA

There is no future.

TIME TRAVELLER

Man's past is mainly a grim struggle

for survival, but there have been

moments when a few voices have spoken

up.  These rare moments have made the

history of man a glorious thing.  I

refuse to believe it is dead and gone.

We've had our dark ages before and

this is only another of them.  All

you need is for someone to show you

the way out. - I'm only a tinkering

mechanic, but there must be this

hidden spark in one of your people.

If I can only kindle that spark, my

coming here will have some meaning.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

My efforts next morning to open the

panel were fruitless.  I had to find

another way to retrieve my Machine.

TIME TRAVELLER

Listen!

(pause)

Do you hear?

WEENA (fearfully)

Yes.

TIME TRAVELLER

Machines!

WEENA

No...Morlocks.

TIME TRAVELLER

(straightening, amazed)

You mean those animals run machines?

WEENA

They are Morlocks.

TIME TRAVELLER

(as he walks to her)

I know, but have you seen the

machines?

WEENA

No, only heard of them.

TIME TRAVELLER

Who told you?

WEENA

The talking rings.

TIME TRAVELLER

(moves closer to her)

What sort of rings?

WEENA

(with a shrug)

Rings that talk.

TIME TRAVELLER

Can you show me these rings?

DISSOLVE TO:

TIME TRAVELLER

(picking up a ring)

Are these the talking rings?

WEENA

Yes.

TIME TRAVELLER

They speak?

WEENA

Yes.

TIME TRAVELLER

Of what?

WEENA

Things no one here understands.

TIME TRAVELLER

How do you get it to talk?

VOICE FROM RING

Whomsoever chances upon these rings

will probably hear the last recorded

voice of civilized man.  This is the

year four thousand eight hundred and

twenty-nine.

VOICE FROM RING (cont'd)

The war between the East and West,

which is now in its three hundredth

and twenty-sixth year has at last

come to an end.  There is nothing

left to fight with and few of us

left to fight.  The atmosphere has

become so polluted with deadly

germs that it can no longer be

breathed.  There is no place on

this planet that is immune.  The

last surviving factory for the

manufacture of oxygen has been

destroyed.  Stockpiles are rapidly

diminishing and when they are gone,

we must die...

ANOTHER VOICE FROM RING

This is the last day.  We, the last

to survive, have had our final meeting.

We have decided to split into two

groups.  Each man and woman has made

his own decision.  Some have chosen

to take refuge in the great caverns

and find a new way of life far down

below the earth's surface.  The rest

of us have decided to take our chances

in the sunlight, small as those chances

may be.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

From the talking rings I learned how

the human race divided itself and

how the world of the Eloi and Morlocks

began.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

By some quirk of fate the Morlocks

had become the masters and the Eloi

their servants.  The Morlocks main-

tained them and bred them like cattle

only to take them below when they

reached maturity, which explained why

there were no older people along them.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

Now I knew I must go below.  It was

the only means of finding a way up

into the sphinx to reach my Machine

and to find out what happened to the

little people when they went below.

WEENA

No...don't go...please.

WEENA

You will not come back.

TIME TRAVELLER

I'll be back.

ing sequence the dirge-like WHISTLES

CONTINUE, ECHOING mournfully.)

TIME TRAVELLER

Weena!  Where are you, Girl?

TIME TRAVELLER

What's happening?  Tell me!

TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)

Weena!

TIME TRAVELLER (shouts in

despair)

Weena!

TIME TRAVELLER

Stop!

TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)

What are you running from?

TIME TRAVELLER (sharply,

gesturing back toward the panel)

Where have they gone?

(no answer)

What happens to them?

(no answer)

Don't stand there like a fatted

cattle grazing contentedly in lush

pastures. - Answer me!  What's

wrong?

MAN IN WHITE (calmly)

There is nothing wrong.  It is all

clear.

TIME TRAVELLER

What do you mean, all clear?

MAN IN WHITE (repeating)

All clear!

TIME TRAVELLER (thinking

rapidly, talking to himself)

Once....in the middle nineteen

hundreds I heard a man...

(it bursts upon him)

The falling bombs!

(to the Man in white

and the crowd)

That's over.  Gone.  Dead for

hundreds of thousand of years.

There are no more flying machines.

No bombs.  No wars!

MAN IN WHITE

Yes, the rings have told us that

story.

TIME TRAVELLER

But you didn't listen.  You didn't

learn anything.  All that is left

is fear...a blind animal fear.

Ages ago men were taught to hide in

the ground when the sirens blew...

taught to run from a raining death...

but those men are dead!  And so are

the men who slaughtered them.  Don't

you understand?

(looks around pleadingly)

You are slaves of a dead past... You

don't even own your souls.  You're

led to slaughter like sheep!

MAN IN WHITE (o.s.)

But there is nothing to fear now,

it's all clear.

TIME TRAVELLER

What about those who went below?

How are they to come back?

MAN IN WHITE

They never come back.  Nobody can

bring them back.

TIME TRAVELLER

You can try.  Won't any of you

even try?

TIME TRAVELLER (almost

to himself)

Well, someone has to try!

MACHINES punctuate the desolation of this

scene as well as the following sequence.)

T.T.'S VOICE

So, this was the destiny of the

Eloi.

T.T.'S VOICE

(continuing)

They were being bred like cattle

by the Morlocks who had degenerated

into the lowest form of human

life...cannibalism.

T.T.

Weena!

T.T.

(shaking her)

Girl!

(he turns and grasps the

passing Young Man)

Come to your senses!  All of you!

TIME TRAVELLER (muttering)

Burn, will you!

TIME TRAVELLER

Quick, something to burn!  It's

my last match!

TIME TRAVELLER

Weena!  Weena, get the torch!

TIME TRAVELLER

Weena!  Go on!  Go on the

steps!

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

(calmly)

The underworld of the Morlocks was

gone...and so was the life of leisure

for the Eloi.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

From now on they would have to work

to survive.  And looking at their

faces, I somehow knew that they could

start over again.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

Another night was coming, but this

night no Eloi needed to fear.

TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE

But what of me? - I was imprisoned

in a world in which I did not belong.

DISSOLVE TO:

WEENA

Are you sorry?

TIME TRAVELLER

Sorry? - Sorry for what?

WEENA

That you have to stay.

TIME TRAVELLER

(gazing into the night)

Yes. - I am sorry because I could

tell so much to the people of my

own time... I could tell them about

the happiness and sorrow the future

has in store for them.  They could

learn from it...or would they?

WEENA

You don't want to stay, do you?

TIME TRAVELLER

It isn't that, but I don't fit here

anymore than you would in my time.

WEENA

(a pause, and then)

I would like to see your time.

TIME TRAVELLER

No, Girl, you wouldn't be very

happy there.

WEENA

Do you have someone like me -

there?

TIME TRAVELLER

No.  No one like you.  But there

are friends who will miss me. - As

a matter of fact, I'm probably late

already.

WEENA

(stealing a glance,

then quietly)

Women?

TIME TRAVELLER

No, men.

(teasing)

There is a woman too, of course!

(noticing her disappointment,

he relents)

She looks after my house for me.

She is sixty-two years old. - Much

older than you are.

WEENA

(suddenly)

How do they wear their hair?

TIME TRAVELLER

Who?

WEENA

The women in your time.

TIME TRAVELLER

(after a thought)

Up!

WEENA

Up? - How?

TIME TRAVELLER

(with awkward gesture)

Like this.

WEENA

Show me.

WEENA

(innocently)

Would I be pretty?

TIME TRAVELLER

(slowly)

Yes...you would be.  More than

pretty.

(his voice sinks to a whisper)

I wish we could go back together,

Weena, back to my own time...or to

times before that when the world

was young.  We could...

TIME TRAVELLER (without

looking at her)

Come, Girl!

backward.)

The red hot lava withdraws through the         (a,b,c)

street ruins and the great rents in the

ground gulp it up quickly.  Out of the

ruins building are molded and then

atomic explosions in reverse flash

across the screen.  The SOUND OF

EXPLOSIONS, RUMBLING ETC.  IN REVERSE

AND SPEEDED UP join the HUMMING of the

Time Machine.

BLUR TO:

The sun and the moon chase each other          (d,e)

alternately across the sky, gradually

slowing.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

DR. HILLYER

It is ridiculous!  Simply preposterous!

BRIDEWELL

Well, there's one thing I'll say

for you, George.  You always could

tell a good story.  Best adventure

yarn I've heard for years.

(loudly)

You're a truly fine inventor,

George!

MRS. WATCHETT

I'll turn down your bed for you!

KEMP

Truthfully, where have you been

for the past week?

BRIDEWELL

(voice of experience)

Now, we shouldn't ask such questions,

Walter.  It's not hard for a man to

lose a week now and then.

TIME TRAVELLER (smiling)

I understand your doubt.  Take it

as a lie if you wish.  Now that

I'm back I scarcely believe it

myself.

(a flash of memory)

Except that...

(groping in pocket)

...here are the flowers Weena gave

me.

TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)

A present for you, David.

TIME TRAVELLER (to Filby)

You were always interested in

botany. - Try to match them with

any species known today.

FILBY

I don't think I can.

DR. HILLYER

Are you coming, Kemp.

KEMP

It's getting late and you look

exhausted.  You had better get

some rest.

FILBY

Goodnight, George.

TIME TRAVELLER

Thank you, David, for being such

a good friend - always.

KEMP

What do you think, Filby?

FILBY (after a pause)

One thing is certain.  Those

flowers couldn't have possibly

bloomed in the winter-time.

HILLYER (in the b.g.)

You don't really think that story

was true?

FILBY

Look, you chaps go on.  It's

just a short walk home for me.

HILLYER (o.s.)

Go on, driver!

FILBY

George!...

MRS. WATCHETT (nervous,

breathless)

Oh, Mr. Filby...what...

(her eyes widen)

FILBY (with finality)

He's gone!

MRS. WATCHETT (to

Filby)

There's something funny here, sir!

FILBY

I think I understand. - Look!

FILEY (pointing)

See the imprint?  This is where

the Time Machine originally

stood.

(he paces across to the

end of the grooves)

But the Morlocks moved it.

They dragged it across the lawn

right into the sphinx...right

here.

(turns and points)

And Weena was standing there when

he last saw her...the same space -

in a different time. - So he moved

back his heavy Machine from here,

across the room, scratching this

floor...

(indicating the grooves

that lead to the imprint)

So that he can appear outside the

sphinx again and help the Eloi

build a new world...and build a

new world of his own.

MRS. WATCHETT (faintly,

sentimentally)

Where he left her!..

FILBY

But it isn't like George. - To

return empty handed.  To try to

rebuild a civilization without

a plan.

(to Mrs. Watchett)

He must have taken something

with him.

MRS. WATCHETT

Nothing.

MRS. WATCHETT

Nothing except three books.

FILBY

Which three books?

MRS. WATCHETT

I don't know. -- Is it important?

FILBY (smiles)

No, I suppose not. - Only...what

three books would you have taken?

MRS. WATCHETT

Mr. Filby, do you think he will

ever return?

FILBY (quietly)

One cannot choose but wonder. -

You see...he has all the time in

the world!

SLOW FADE OUT.

THE END
