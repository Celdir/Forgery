WEINER

Whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that?

OCK

(rising)

We begin again... let's kick in that new

transducer. See if we can double the

power output.

WEINER

(rising more slowly)

Whoa, Doc... wait a minute...

OCK

Okey... dokey!

LIZ

(falling in step)

Hiya Peter...

PETER

(ardent but

uncomfortable)

Hiya Liz... how're you doing...?

LIZ

(teasing softly)

How'm I doing what?

HARRY

Peter! Peter! Wait up!

HARRY

(to Liz)

Would you, uh... excuse us for a minute?

PETER

What is it? what...

HARRY

Did the Astro-Physics Journal really

accept your paper?

PETER

(laughs, embarrassed)

Yeah... well... all I got's the data but

they've agreed to publish it when it's

finished. You know... it's my

calculation on the Planetary Conjunction.

HARRY

And its influence on the anti-force.

Isn't it?

PETER

Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with...

(indicates Liz standing

there)

HARRY

Yeah, you and the rest of the class.

Every one is busy with Liz.

LIZ

(growing impatient)

Peter?

FLASH

Hiya, cupcakes...

LIZ

(elbowing him

affectionately)

Flash...!

HARRY

(sneering)

And Flash is the busiest of them all...

PETER

(disappointed)

Come on, Harry... we'll be late for

Octavius.

HARRY

Ock is nuts, don't you agree?

PETER

Ock is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But,

a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.

ROZ

(knocking furiously)

Doctor Octavius! You are late for your

lecture. The students are waiting.

Doctor Octavius!

THORKEL

Your friend is impossible Professor

Rosomorf, I told the board we should let

him go.

THORKEL

What's he doing in there, not his crazy

experiment again.

ROZ

You mean his anti-force theory... one day

they'll give him the Nobel Prize for it.

THORKEL

Meanwhile he is demolishing our

university. Octavius!!

(knocks)

Open the door.

OCK

The anti-force experiment has now reached

the limit of electronic overload safety.

Therefore, Weiner, you will disconnect

the overload safety device...

WEINER

Whoa, Doc... someone's at the door...

OCK

(ignoring)

World class scientific mind and they

stick me in the basement with this third

rate cyclotron...

OCK

Okey! Dokey!

LIZ

(softly)

What is it, Peter?

PETER

(embarrassed)

It's nothing.

WEINER

Yes, gentleman can I help you?

THORKEL

Tell your boss, that his class is waiting.

WEINER

(looks)

You better tell him yourself.

ROZ & THORKEL

Professor Octavius!!

OCK

Gentlemen, come, you must see this.

ROZ

But, your students...

OCK

The imbeciles can wait... I have better

things to do than teach introductory

Physics Rosomorf. Undergrads are

kindless adolescence.

THORKEL

You see he is impossible.

OCK

Thorkel you are the dummiest

administrator our university has ever had.

(Thorkel turns to go)

Don't go Thorkel!! Come! Look!

THORKEL

The university pays you to teach

something to your students.

LIZ

Well, do you mean nothing... or do you

mean something but you won't tell me what

it is?

PETER

(regaining)

I mean plain nothing.

LIZ

Well, I guess that's about as nothing as

you can get... plain nothing.

A beat.

PETER

Liz...!

LIZ

Ahh, it is something.

PETER

No... look.

OCK

I am going for 20 percent power!

THORKEL

NO!! Don't do that...

ROZ

Ock! Its dangerous...

THORKEL

Ock I warn you...

THORKEL

Keep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the

front door. Everybody out the front.

PETER

Liz! Come on...!

LIZ

I can't. Help me!

PETER

I'm coming!

LIZ

Peter!

THORKEL

Get back, you idiots. You can't go in

there!

LIZ

(out at the street)

Help! Help me!

PETER

Thanks for your help Flash.

FLASH

No problem wimp.

PETER

Our hero has a real way with words.

LIZ

Oh, why don't you grow up.

THORKEL

This man will bring a disaster upon this

university.

OCK

The universe is made up of forces... and

counter-forces. Science is the study of

the forces!

OCK

(continues without a

hitch)

But I... Professor Otto Octavius... have

devoted my life to the study of the

counter-forces! Good job, Peter.

PETER

(taking place at lab

table)

Thanks, Professor.

THORKEL

I don't believe it, I simply don't...

OCK

Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel.

THORKEL

I don't believe... oh, all right carry on

Professor.

OCK

Well! This week my dear students I have

made a stunning breakthrough...

THORKEL

Wait a minute, wait a minute... you've

got fire forms to fill out, Dr. Octavius.

OCK

I have no time for forms, or

administrators who persist in

interrupting me, Mr. Thorkel.

OCK

I now believe its possible that these

counter forces can be... collected... the

way the magnifying glass collects the

sunlight... and focused into a hard beam

I call... Weiner!

OCK

I call it, the Anti-Force!

OCK

(continues as he works)

This anti-force, once harnessed, is

capable of undoing any natural force at

which it is aimed... for instance...

(looks up maniacally)

Gravity!

LIZ

(whispers)

I'm sorry...

PETER

It's alright.

OCK

We patch in the cyclotron...

The lights flicker and go dim.

OCK

Pay no attention to the lights... I of

course steal its energy, and it looses

power. We patch in the cyclotron... and

we gradually apply power. The power that

I am stealing...

OCK

And so we stand, four square against the

fundamental force that orders and

maintains our universe... gravity...

which is holding down this goddamn ball.

Rise!

HARRY

What a crock...

PETER

Shut up Harry... this is very interesting.

OCK

Mr. Parker! Have you some... interesting

observation you'd like to share with the

class?

PETER

No sir...

OCK

Then shut up! And pay some attention to

the experiment.

OCK

Rise! Rise!!!

OCK

Now that's what I call an experiment!

OCK

You are looking at a representation of

two universes. Our Blue one. Our real

universe... something we can touch and

feel and see and draw calculations about.

This is us. The Yellow universe... this

is something else. Some other dimension...

something... on the other side!

BRIGHT GREEN.

OCK

If it were possible to generate enough

power behind it, the anti-force could

wipe out not just gravity... but all our

universal forces at the same time. In

effect... it would blast a hole between

this universe and the next. Each...

(indicates green spheres)

would flow into each other. No blue

universe. No yellow. End, finished,

over.

LIZ

(with a student's ear)

That sounds like a scenario for the end

of the world.

OCK

My girl, it is! It is. It would mean

wiping out everything that's known... and

letting in everything that's unknown.

FLASH

Isn't that a little dangerous?

OCK

Don't worry yourself, true inter-

dimensional penetration is still purely

theoretical, but one day... Maybe very

near... maybe in the 21st century...

LIZ

(whispers to Peter)

Look, it's just... I don't know... when

you and Flash go after each other like

that...

PETER

(whispers)

He's not my type.

LIZ

He doesn't have to be.

PETER

Check.

LIZ

And besides, he's not all bad.

PETER

You don't get nicknamed Flash because

you're a rocket scientist, Liz.

LIZ

Give it up, Parker. You'd die for a

nickname like Flash.

PETER

Yeah, of embarrassment.

KIM

(teasing)

Hey, Flash... I'm scalping a pair of the

Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow

night.

FLASH

The Slammies??? I'd kill for that!!!

KIM

Would you pay $125?

FLASH

Well, uh, I... gee... if... can I tell

you tomorrow?

KIM

(moving on)

You snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz...

LIZ

Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is

my new roommate... Kim Nickson.

KIM

(interested)

Hellooo, Peter.

PETER

(embarrassed)

Hi...

LIZ

We're going to the Student Reunion

Meeting. You coming?

PETER

(frustrated)

I can't... I gotta go over to the Daily

Bugle. I'm trying to sell some photos.

KIM

Soooh, a photographer...?

PETER

Just an amateur. Well... nice meeting

you, Kim.

KIM

Yeah... I bet it would be.

HARRY

Can I be your date for the reunion

ShooShoo?

KIM

No Jerk!

HARRY

(she turns to go)

What did I say...

LIZ

It's not what you said, it's how you say

it, ShooShoo!

HARRY

Damn!

WEINER

Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you.

PETER

About my data I bet.

WEINER

I don't know.

PETER

He knows about my work on the Planetary

Conjunction, doesn't he?

WEINER

(lies)

I don't know.

PETER

Hello, Professor Octavius.

(no response)

I really admired your experiment.

OCK

(back to Peter)

We have a lot of interests in common,

Peter. Perhaps we should put our heads

together, if you know what I mean...

PETER

(flattered)

That would be... great.

OCK

(turns with a smile)

Now you take the Planetary Conjunction.

This Saturday night we will witness

Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the

Sun... all in a row. Never seen within

the memory of man, or measured for its

effect. The total gravitational force

must be quite exceptional. Isn't that

the subject of your paper...?

PETER

Yes sir, I've worked out a new way to

calculate the combined gravitational

effect.

OCK

I'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think

I could find the time to go over it with

you. Make sure it all... checks out.

PETER

Well... I'm sort of working with

Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we

kind of keep it between us. He thinks

that my theory is... well, I don't know...

OCK

(to himself)

The scoundrel...

(turns angry)

I want to see that data, Peter!

PETER

But Professor Octavius... if I knew you

were interested... sorry, I've already

given it to... Professor Rosomorf, and he

is after all the head of our Physics

Department... and I couldn't...

OCK

Well, I'm certain something can be worked

out. Run along, young man.

OCK

Just a minute... how about if I show you

my discoveries... something I never

showed to any other student... as a

matter of fact to anybody at all.

PETER

Well I am really flattered, I mean I'd

love to... but I...

OCK

Very well shall we say if you come here

tonight...

PETER

But Professor I don't now if I should...

OCK

Make it eight sharp... I'll be waiting

for you... Right here...

OCK

The same academic world that's so keen to

embrace that boy's undergraduate work,

ridicules my anti-force theory as

quackery. I ask you, Weiner... what is

our society coming to? Ha!

WEINER

They are all a bunch of brainless

assholes, that's what I say...

OCK

Weiner! Go get me that boy's data!

WEINER

Cost you fifty bucks.

OCK

(Weiner hissing)

Just get it. We'll negotiate your fee

when you have the data, alright Weiner?

JAMESON (V.O.)

Garbage! Absolute, 100% garbage!

JAMESON

Bag ladies. I hate bag ladies.

PETER

Yes, sir.

JAMESON

(looks at the other photos)

Little kids... I hate little kids. This

is a daily newspaper. We need news value

photographs, not artsy-fartsy shit!

PETER

Yes, sir.

JAMESON

Kid? You want a pro's assessment?

PETER

Yes, sir!

JAMESON

(handing photos back)

Your photos suck.

(cigar for emphasis)

Parker, my readers are morons. I gotta

grab them by the eyes. Every time you

press the button of that Nikon of yours

it costs you fifty-five cents. So the

next time you're about to take the plunge,

ask yourself, am I taking dog bites man?

Because if you are...

PETER

I know, I know. You want man bites dog...

JAMESON

Parker, this is the post modern 20th

century. I want man eats dog! Get out!

PETER

(reading)

Rent! Rent, more bills, rent...

electricity, bills...

PETER

There's nothing in there worth stealing!

MAY (V.O.)

(from within the kitchen)

That's the understatement of the year.

PETER

Aunt May, you're trespassing.

MAY

(comes in)

I was just so desperately bored... I

thought I'd come over and make you dinner...

PETER

I am old enough to... to make my own--

MAY

But I didn't feel like getting to know

your roaches.

PETER

I'll introduce you.

MAY

Oh. And those foul chemicals in the pots...

PETER

I take pictures, remember?

MAY

Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for

dinner in Forest Hills...

PETER

It's Friday night...

MAY

Yes. Do you have a date?

PETER

No.

MAY

Then come on.

THORKEL

(at his ear)

Professor Rosomorf, what happened here?

ROZ

Someone tried to rob me of some paper...

I suspect they were looking for that one.

THORKEL

What is it?

ROZ

(unruffled)

Award winning stuff.

(turning slightly)

Peter Parker's data on the Planetary

Conjunction. Damn lucky I hid it in my

computer under another title.

THORKEL

My God, what's going on in our school?

First Professor Octavius almost blows up

the Physics lab... Now this. You report

it in triplicate, of course.

ROZ

Thorkel, be careful when you talk to

Octavius. Remember... the man is a very

fragile genius. One day he'll bring us

all the Noble Prize.

THORKEL

Rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous

crackpot!

ROZ

That's him again. He's working day and

night.

THORKEL

I tell you the man is very dangerous.

(the whine grows louder)

Come on Rosomorf, let's stop him before

this building will explode.

THORKEL

Shut it down, Octavius.

THORKEL

You've blown half the circuits in the

Science Center.

OCK

Call an electrician.

THORKEL

I have called the locksmith.

OCK

What... what is he doing.

THORKEL

We have to shut your lab down and take a

look at the lines.

ROZ

Please, Otto, we must lock it up.

OCK

(to Thorkel)

You're denying me access to my cyclotron?!

THORKEL

You bet.

OCK

(contemplating)

Okey, dokey... just give me till tomorrow.

I want to clean up my papers. Tomorrow...

Ha... Tomorrow you can have this room...

ROZ

Oh... well Thorkel... few more hours

won't make a difference.

THORKEL

I hope.

BEN

Another brewski?

PETER

No, I'm fine, Uncle Ben.

BEN

(at T.V.)

Yah! Way to do it. Alright!

(to Peter)

You don't follow the Mets like you used

to, do you, Pete?

PETER

No, not so much anymore.

BEN

Funny. When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed

away... I had this idea... I wanted you

to be the best baseball player that ever

was. Geez, what ever happened to that?

PETER

Little league.

BEN

(soft and warm)

Yeah... Babe Ruth you wasn't.

AUNT MAY

It's on the table! Turn off the TV!

AUNT MAY

How's that girl you told us about, Peter?

PETER

Liz? She's great... But she has a

boyfriend.

AUNT MAY

A boy your age should have a girlfriend.

PETER

Aunt May... she has a steady boyfriend.

AUNT MAY

Peter, any girl that's worth your

attention is of course gonna have a

boyfriend... But if she really gets to

know what you have to offer she'll... you

get my drift?

BEN

Look, just leave him alone, okay. When

he's ready for girls he'll be a holy

terror.

(winks)

It's in the blood.

(now serious business)

Lookit, how are you fixed for money,

Pete? Maybe I can help you out a little.

PETER

(lying to them)

No, I'm alright. My scholarship covers

almost everything, and I sell some photos

here and there. Today my physics

professor asked for some of my work... he

wants to study my data. They might

publish my work in the science magazine...

that'll bring me some money...

BEN

(practically cheering)

Publish your work?! You hear that May...?

PETER

(embarrassed laughs)

Yeah, in fact I have to leave a little

early tonight, to meet Professor

Octavius... He offered me to be his

assistant...

BEN

Whoa! Did you hear that May...?

AUNT MAY

Oh, Peter, you promised you'd spend the

night...

PETER

I... I can't, Aunt May. Professor

Octavius wants to discuss my new

findings.

AUNT MAY

(disappointed)

Peter, what you should be finding... is a

nice girlfriend.

OCK

I'll show them... closing the cyclotron

on me... Weiner!

WEINER

Yes, Professor...

OCK

Where is he? It's ten past eight o'clock...

WEINER

(with mouth full)

That must be him.

He opens the door.

PETER

Good evening.

OCK

You are late.

(to Weiner)

Weiner, go outside and get us something

to eat. And don't steal it! Just buy it.

I'll reimburse you.

WEINER

(to Peter)

Do you want anything Parker?

PETER

No thank you, I just had dinner at my

aunt's...

OCK

Piss off, Weiner!

OCK

Okey, dokey, Parker... how would you like

to take Weiner's place... I mean, be my

assistant?

PETER

Well, Professor, that would be a great

honor, but I'm already working with...

OCK

Rosomorf... that imbecile. Don't you

understand, kid, that I am about to

uncover the greatest discovery since

Einstein came up with his theory of

relativity... The "Anti-Force."

PETER

Wow! The theory of the Anti-force! You

should go for the Noble Prize Professor...

OCK

Noble Shmoble, I am going for a much

bigger prize kid. Okey, dokey. Let me

show you, kid, what I got here.

OCK

Present maximum anti-force power to date

is 38 percent of theoretical limit. I

have patched in the variable

particle-wave accelerator...

(shrugs)

I will now try to reach 50% power...

(big breath)

And if your paper has any value... I can

use it to get the power I'm missing to

create the anti-force, to break through

and beat any other form of power in our

or any other universe, capish!

PETER

Sorry, Professor, I can't do it. I gave

my word to Professor Rosomorf.

OCK

(screaming)

50 percent... anti-force... 50 percent...

that's all I'm missing! Parker, we can

be rich together!

PETER

Sorry... I'd better go now.

OCK

(really angry now)

You'll be sorry, Parker.

OCK

You! Get out of there, you creeping...

OCK

(anguish)

Noooooooooooo!

OCK

(ecstasy above the din)

It's an energy storm! Okey! Dokey!

WEINER

Professor... what happened to you? What

did you do...

WEINER

Oh my God... what happened here...

WEINER

I better get out of here.

THORKEL

(through bull horn)

There is no danger. Please go back to

your dorms. I repeat, there is no danger.

JAMESON

(approaches him)

Spill it out, Professor! The public

wants to know!

THORKEL

Who are you?

JAMESON

Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now

what really happened here?

THORKEL

There will be a press announcement in the

morning Mr. Jameson... now if you'll

excuse me.

THORKEL

I have nothing to say... there will be an

announcement. Now, please go home...

everybody... we must clear the grounds...

FLASH

You think they'll cancel classes?

HARRY

They must... the whole building must be

contaminated with some kind of poisonous

gas.

PETER

How about nuclear contaminations?

KIM

My God... lets beat it.

But nobody moves.

LIZ

(more interested in other

things)

Could anyone be in there, Peter?

PETER

(concerned)

I don't know... Maybe Professor Octavius.

He usually works late...

FLASH

That nut, I bet it was all his doing...

JAMESON

(seeing Peter)

Hey Parker! Peter Parker!

PETER

Mr. Jameson! What are you doing here?

What's going on?

JAMESON

That's for them to know, and for you to

find out.

PETER

But sir, they wouldn't tell us. You

heard Thorkel... he said...

JAMESON

A press announcement tomorrow...! But we

must know tonight Parker. This is your

university, right...

PETER

Yes, but...

JAMESON

You got your camera?

PETER

Sure, but I can't--

JAMESON

A hundred dollars says you can?

PETER

Yes sir!

JAMESON

Get inside and get pictures, fifty bucks.

PETER

You just said a hundred.

JAMESON

Seventy, but I want blood and gore.

PETER

(calling back)

Seeya guys.

LIZ

Where is he going?

JAMESON

To make fifty bucks.

ROZ (V.O.)

(filtered through face mask)

Take it easy. Take it easy with him.

THORKEL (V.O.)

Take him away and never bring him back!

THORKEL

What was that?

ROZ

What was what?

THORKEL

What hit me?

ROZ

What hit you?

THORKEL

I don't know. It was so fast.

ROZ

You're going to be fine, Otto.

PETER

Ow!!!

GUARD (V.O.)

(heavily distorted)

Hey! What are you doing here, kid?

PETER

I feel a little funny...

GUARD

(heavily distorted)

Yeah? Well, I ain't laughing. Get out...

Just get out of here...

GUARD

(still distorted)

You get yourself over to the Police lines.

PETER

(ultra wooz)

Right. Police lines.

JAMESON

(distorted)

Okay, scoop, whaddaya got?

PETER

I... got pictures of the Professor... in

there... it's so strange in there... so

bizarre...

JAMESON

(winks)

Good job, kid. Bizarre is what we need.

Pick this up in the morning.

(holding up his camera)

There'll be two crisp twenties tucked

inside.

PETER

(mutters to himself)

This is weird. My God, I feel so weird...

PETER

(exhilarated)

Very weird.

PETER

(sideways)

Very, very weird.

PETER

Well, what the hell!!

REISS

You're a kid who's going places, and I'm

gonna point you the right way.

PETER

(reading card)

Max Reiss, models, strip dancers, escort

girls, blue movies...

REISS

Oops... sorry, wrong card.

(exchanges cards)

PETER

Max Reiss, Talent management.

REISS

It's a big outfit. Got a lot of

departments.

PETER

Yeah... well... why you approach me? I'm

not...

REISS

Oh yes you are... very talented. The

three questions of show business success.

One do you think you possess a unique

talent?

PETER

Well...

REISS

Two... what are you gonna do with it?

PETER

(not a clue)

Well... I don't know.

REISS

(the clincher)

Three... how much money you got in your

pocket?

PETER

Ten.

REISS

You invest half of that with me and I'll

make you a star.

PETER

(laughing)

What are you talking about?

REISS

I'm talking about fame. I'm talking

about fortune. I'm talking about the

chance of a lifetime. How'd you like to

be on MTV tomorrow night?

PETER

MTV...? Me? Really?

REISS

Taxi!

PETER

Hey!

REISS

(getting in)

Kid! Tomorrow night. Same place, same

time.

PETER

(calling after)

How do you know I'll show up?

REISS

(from the taxi window)

Because you wanna be a star... everybody

does.

PETER

Hello? Aunt May?

AUNT MAY (V.O.)

(filtered)

Peter? What time is it? Are you alright?

PETER

Well, no, I mean yeah I'm fine, but

listen... Aunti, the craziest thing

happened to me tonight.

AUNT MAY

(lovingly)

Does this have to do with a certain girl

we talked about at dinner?

PETER

No, no, look, there was this radioactive

experiment... I was poisoned!

AUNT MAY

You were what?

PETER

I was bitten by a bug.

AUNT MAY

Oh! I get it, you mean a love bug.

PETER

No... No... A spider...

AUNT MAY

Peter, did you at least talk to her?

PETER

Aunt May, listen to me. I got bitten on

the hand... by a poisonous spider.

AUNT MAY

She bit you?

PETER

No. I was in the bathroom and...

AUNT MAY

Oh, you did it in the bathroom? Peter,

this is craziness, why don't you use your

bed? You're up all night. You're in the

radioactive labs. You never take time to

eat or sleep. Am I right?

PETER

Yes, Aunt May.

AUNT MAY (V.O.)

Did you eat something today?

PETER

Yes, Aunt May.

AUNT MAY (V.O.)

Okay, Peter go back to bed, and remember

we love you.

PETER

And I love you too, Aunt May.

(hangs up)

And by the way, I got a mess of super

powers today.

CHIEF SURGEON

(whispers)

Look at these brainwave readings. The

mental activity is ten times of any

normal man...!

BRAINMAN

(whispers)

Equipment malfunction...?

CHIEF SURGEON

(whispers)

Hell, yeah... his.

(checks Ock's chest)

My God... I thought I'd seen everything...

SURGEON #2

(whispers)

But this is beyond medicine. This is

madness...!

NURSE

(leaning in, blitzed)

It is so freaky...

CHIEF SURGEON

(stern for the staff's

sake)

Okay, lets stop yakking and get cracking.

I want to go in at the upper thoracic.

Then we'll work our way around.

(slaps Ock's shoulder)

Hang in there, man.

CHIEF SURGEON

(glares)

Nurse! Number seven scalpel.

Arthroscope stand by. Read out

parameters in progress. Let's go in.

You alright?

NURSE

Yes... Yes, of course. Everything's

online.

CHIEF SURGEON

Scalpel! No... no... a larger one...

the largest we have!

HEAD NURSE

Kill the alarms!

BRAINMAN

He's going off the chart!

CHIEF SURGEON

Mop. Mop! Sutures and clamps! Hurry up!

SURGEON #2

We're losing him. Defibrillate!

CHIEF SURGEON

Zap him!

BRAINMAN

Stabilizing alpha waves...

NURSE

You have a visitor, Doctor...

THORKEL

(enjoying this)

Octavius, I'm afraid I have bad news for

you.

OCK

The cyclotron is damaged...

THORKEL

What used to be the cyclotron was

permanently shut down this afternoon.

OCK

But my work!

THORKEL

Your work is a disaster! Look at

yourself!

OCK

Myself? I don't matter. Nobody matters

anymore. To enter a new dimension we

must first destroy our own...

THORKEL

What are you saying?

OCK

Destroy life. Life is... insignificant.

Bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. What

would you say?

THORKEL

Oh, my God, what are those horrible

things sticking from your body?

OCK

(gets more and more excited)

Thorkel, if I told you that for one

moment in time I broke all the laws! For

one brief glorious moment, I broke

through to the other side. I saw... I

felt... I became creation.

THORKEL

What on Earth are you rambling about?

OCK

Destiny!!! My destiny! I see it all so

clearly now. Universal destruction, yes.

All I need is the power... then I can

destroy this illusion you call life. It

is my destiny to lead us to the light!

THORKEL

You're a madman.

OCK

And you are a fool. I will end the

universe as you know it. And in that

final moment... I'll laugh my ass off

while you're kissing yours goodbye!

THORKEL

(excited)

Goodbye is right, Octavius... You're

fired... sacked... canned. You are

history, Doctor Octavius. And I couldn't

be more pleased to be the first to tell

you this good news...

THORKEL

(his last words)

Let me down Ock... you crazy... MONSTER!

Let me down!

OCK

Okey, dokey.

PETER

(looking up at the sign)

MTV Wrestling?!

REISS

(getting out)

That's the place. Pay the man.

PETER

Look, Mr. Reiss... I'm not real

interested in watching a wrestling match.

REISS

Who said anything about watching a

wrestling match? You're here to win a

wrestling match!

PETER

Me? You must be kidding.

REISS

You hop around. You know, the way you

did last night. Your opponent gets tired.

He falls down. The ref counts to three,

you win, and we pick up a thousand bucks.

REISS

You're really gonna love this.

PETER

Look, really, I don't know...

REISS

You don't have to know. I know enough

for both of us.

(pause)

Change in there.

PETER

What is this?

REISS

A costume... something that fits your

talent. Go put it on. I'm sure you'll

like it.

PETER

(comes out)

How does it look? I feel like it's

Halloween.

REISS

Cover your face with the mask.

PETER

Why?

REISS

Mystery, my friend. Nobody should know

who you are...

RING ANNOUNCER

And now, a new challenger, for the

thousand dollar fight, weighing in at one

hundred and fifty pounds... from parts

unknown! Here is the Amazing...

Mysterious... Incredible Superman...

REISS

(snorts from ringside,

hating the name)

No, not Superman... Spider-Man...

SPIDER-MAN!!!

RING ANNOUNCER

...Spider-Man!!!!!

OLD LADY

Kill the sucker, Crusher!

HIPSTER

(between two blondes)

Whatsamatter, Crusher, can't you crush

that bug?

CRUSHER

(to Spidey)

Okay, Web Face, this is it!

HIPSTER

Hey, Crusher, you need a insecticide!

(his blondes titter)

FLASH

Will you look at this Spider-Man guy! He

is absolutely incredible!

KIM

Liz, get a load of this outfit! I wish I

had it for the Halloween party... it's

quite sexy.

LIZ

Will you two shush. I'm trying to work.

REF

One...!

REISS

Get up...! Get up...!

REF

Two...!

SPIDER-MAN

(whispers to himself)

Wow...

REF

Ladies and Gentlemen, history is made

today, we have here the first man to win

a thousand dollars against the mighty

Crusher.

PETER

Max! Am I really gonna get a thousand...

REISS

We are going to get a thousand--

CRUSHER

Hi, who are you, kid?

PETER

I'm Peter Parker.

REISS

He is Spider-Man, and I handle him...

Whenever you want a rematch call me.

Next time it's gonna be ten thousand,

what do you say... Crusher?

SPIDER-MAN

Oh, look, Mr. Crusher, I'm really sorry

about what happened in there. Really...

CRUSHER

Oh, well, I don't know what happened to

me tonight...

(measures his muscles)

I really don't know...

REISS

I know... you lost. Big man you lost to

the Amazing Spider-Man.

PETER

(indicating truck)

You know who that is?

LIZ

(walking ahead)

Yeah... he's some clown we saw on TV last

night... boy does Flash think he's hot.

PETER

He does...

KIM

I love wrestling.

HARRY

Wrestling is all bluff. Do you really

believe this little guy in a stupid

Spider-Man suit beat the Crusher?

LIZ

Hey, we better rush... visiting hours

will be over soon.

NURSE

Doctor Octavius? You have visitors.

Doctor Octavius?

PETER

Ock is not here!

LIZ

My God, what happened?

NURSE

I'd better call the doctor!

HARRY

You'd better call the police!

OCK

What a wreck. What a useless, wasted

wreck. Okey, dokey. We rebuild you, my

damaged darling. Bigger, better, hotter!

A world class, super cyclotron!

WEINER

There you are, doc... where have you

been... whoa this place is messed up.

WEINER

(smirks)

Whoa, doc! You look a little messed up

yourself.

OCK

Where have you been, you imbecile?

WEINER

I went to the wrestling...

OCK

Wrestling...

WEINER

I went after the kid. You still want

that Parker guy's data, don't you?

OCK

Well, did you get it?

WEINER

No, I followed him... but I lost him in

the crowd.

OCK

Lost him? You--

WEINER

I'll find him, Maestro... I promise...

soon... maybe by tomorrow.

OCK

So how was the wrestling?

WEINER

Fantastic! There was this new wrestler...

beat the mighty Crusher. You won't

believe it... a nothing of a guy... calls

himself this stupid name... the Amazing

Spider-Man... would you believe it?

OCK

Spider-Man, huh? Well, maybe I'll just

go and wrestle myself one of these days...

with all my new arms... I'm sure I can

beat Crusher or any other monster.

OCK

Will I beat him, this Crusher, will I

beat him or not?

WEINER

No... no, please... I mean yes, yes...

you'll beat him easily... let me down...

Please... I'll do anything for you...

OCK

The Parker data... get me the Parker

data, you hear?!!!

SPIDER-MAN

And one like this...

(changing pose)

And one looking real sincere.

SPIDER-MAN

What are you doing here?

WEINER

I'm looking for Peter Parker.

SPIDER-MAN

Oh, yes... so why not use the front door?

WEINER

Hey, I know you...

SPIDER-MAN

You do?

WEINER

I saw you crushing the Crusher.

SPIDER-MAN

You like wrestling?

WEINER

I love it! You are the best wrestler I

have ever seen... please don't hurt me!

WEINER

Oh, please... don't kill me. Please help

me down.

SPIDER-MAN

Of course I'll help you down. I am

Spider-Man... the good guy, am I not?

WEINER

Yes... yes, you are.

SPIDER-MAN

And by the way, Peter Parker does not

live here anymore...

SPIDER-MAN

And tell the Professor he can't have

Peter's data. Goodbye.

(Ock glares at him)

Okay... lets see here. Page three. We

got 30,000 feet of 50-gauge copper co-ax...

twin 550 XK transformers... cadmium

accelerator rails, a half dozen... a GBC

relative multi-phase transducer... and

one yellow thermos.

(finishes computation)

That'll be $475,989.65...

OCK

Wrap it up...

OCK

(a long beat)

Cash! I'll be back soon.

BANK GUARD

What's going on here?

OCK

Cash!

PETER

Doesn't he look amazing in that one?

Look, he's flying in the air!

JAMESON

I don't care if he flies to the moon.

He's just another wrestler in a silly

costume. Look at this, Parker, right off

the wire. This is the guy who hit that

armored truck this morning. They say he

has metal arms... get me a picture of

this character!

PETER

Metal arms?

JAMESON

Four of them.

PETER

Ock...?!

JAMESON

The web faced weirdo... He is a joke in a

Halloween costume... don't make me laugh.

JAMESON

Now get out of here and don't come back

without something I can use!

PETER

Yes sir...

(stops, and turns back)

JAMESON

A mega baloney... A bug in blue tights...

what next?

PETER

The Journal said he was a mega-smash on

MTV...

OCK

(turning from work)

What do you think you're doing?

WEINER

I'm going to the Masquerade. It's

Halloween tonight Doc, aren't you coming

to the School Ball? Whoa, you could go

without an outfit.

OCK

You're not going to any ball, clown.

You're going to get me Peter Parker's

data...

WEINER

I was almost killed on my last try...

Look at all these bruises...

OCK

I don't care if you come back dead. Just

get it!

WEINER

(croaking)

Cost you a thousand bucks, if I get it.

WEINER

All right... boss please let go...

P L E A S E ...

OCK

Just get it, Weiner. I'm running out of

time. If you fail me again, you won't

have to concern yourself with money

anymore... DO YOU GET ME CLOWN?!

HARRY

You should have worn a costume. I told

you to wear a costume.

PETER

It's... embarrassing.

HARRY

There's Liz...

PETER

Yeah...

ROZ

... howdy partners.

PETER/HARRY

Hiya, Professor Rosomorf.

HARRY

Any word on Doctor Octavius?

ROZ

(falling in step)

Nothing beyond what I read in the papers.

I'm afraid he's not the same man we knew.

You know, I've been digging through the

notes on his experiments...

ROZ

You boys must have had an extraordinary

classroom experience.

PETER

(eyeing Spidey)

Yes sir... oh... I'm going to be a little

late with my paper on the Planetary

Conjunction, sir...

ROZ

Whenever you're ready... I'll look at it.

I know it's going to be an important

work... and Peter, take my hat.

ROZ

It is a costume party.

HARRY

Look, there's Spider-Man!

PETER

Not the real one, I'm sure...

HARRY

You can never be sure... all kinds of

crazy stuff can happen at a masquerade

ball...

PETER

I bet I know who it is.

PETER

Hiya, Liz...

LIZ

Hiya, Peter. Who is in the Spider-Man

costume?

PETER

It's a very clever outfit you've got

there, Flash.

FLASH

Take a hike, asshole.

LIZ

(to Peter)

How did you recognize him?

PETER

His pretty blue eyes give him away...

HARRY

Anyway, who'll be sitting with you at the

Halloween Ball?

LIZ

(whispers to Flash)

I wanna dance... Hey, Spider-Man... Shall

we Flash dance?

FLASH/SPIDER-MAN

Hey, I'm reading the paper, okay?

HARRY

Take her now, it's easy...

HARRY

Wanna dance, Schechrezaa?

KIM

I'm pooped.

LIZ

I'm not...

FLASH

Holy jumping jelly beans, willya look at

these pictures of Spider-Man? Wow! Is

this guy great or what?

LIZ

Hey, Peter! These are your pictures!

FLASH

Can't be...

LIZ

It says here "Photos by Peter Parker."

FLASH

(takes off his head mask)

You know this guy, Parker?

PETER

Well, yeah... sort of...

FLASH

Wow... I'll give you anything if you

introduce us.

HARRY

(to Liz)

Will you grant me this dance...?

KIM

Hey, Flash-Man... Wanna dance...?

FLASH

Well, why not.

YOUNG WOMAN

Thank you, thank you. We have a special

surprise guest tonight.

(booo)

The Empire State University Masquerade

Ball presents... The "Slammy" winning

star of MTV'S wrestling tournament... The

Amazing Spider-Man!

FLASH

(whispers firmly)

Go ahead... go ahead!

LIZ

(to Flash)

Come on... Flash...

LIZ

(whispers breathless)

Who are you...?

PETER

One day you'll know...

LIZ

(a long beat)

You sound very familiar.

PETER/SPIDER-MAN

Sure I do... I'm your friendly

neighborhood Spider-Man!

BEN

(to May)

What a bunch of crap. Goddamn rock and

roll's screwed up the whole TV.

BEN

Come on, May. Wake up and go to sleep.

SPIDER-MAN

(fearful)

Hey! Can't you go any faster?

CABBIE

What'm I in, a race?

SPIDER-MAN

(fighting his fear)

I don't know... I get this tingling in my

brain, like some danger is lurking just

ahead. I'm worried about Aunt May and

Uncle Ben...

CABBIE

Your family?

SPIDER-MAN

Well, they are kind of my parents. They

raised me. I lost both of my parents in

a car accident... please step on it!

CABBIE

Step on it... so now you want to kill

yourself in another accident... not with

me, Boychick.

SPIDER-MAN

But I'm telling you... I've got this--

CABBIE

... tingling... I know. And I got

ulcers... Everybody's got something to

worry about.

SPIDER-MAN

Please... Faster... Please.

CABBIE

Okay, you asked for it.

AUNT MAY

What's that?

BEN

What? It's nothing... go back to sleep...

(another crash)

Oh, I'll go look. Go back to sleep.

WEINER

Hmmm...

CABBIE

Some crazy kinda town, huh? You hear

about that hold-up? The guy with the six

arms? Hey, I see it all on this job.

(a beat)

What kinda outfit is that, anyway?

SPIDER-MAN

(panicked)

Look, I'm really in a hurry.

CABBIE

(sly)

You said the magic words, we have a flat

Boychick.

BEN

Mice...

CABBIE

Hey! You wanna hand me that lug wrench?

CABBIE

Some crazy kinda town...

SPIDER-MAN

(a thought)

Sporting goods...

WEINER

All I want it the kid's computer crap!

BEN

Let go before I blow your brain's out.

BEN (V.O.)

Let go!

WEINER (V.O.)

You let go!

PETER

Uncle Ben!

BEN

(a wheeze)

Peter...

PETER

Oh my God... Uncle Ben...

AUNT MAY

(a brave but fragile front)

Ben gets through everything. He'll be

alright. The doctors are...

DETECTIVE

(compassionate)

Excuse me. You the nephew?

DETECTIVE

Your uncle's a brave man. Apparently,

the perpetrator was after something of

yours. Your uncle didn't know what it

was but he stood up to him anyway. You

ought to be proud of him.

PETER

I am... how is he...

DETECTIVE

Ask the Doctor.

AUNT MAY

How's my... how's my husband doing...?

DOCTOR

Mrs. Parker, I'm sorry. We tried.

DOCTOR

Crash cart! STAT!

DETECTIVE

Let the medics handle it.

(pause)

Look, if it makes you feel any better.

We're gonna nail this guy. He crashed

his getaway car. We got him trapped in a

warehouse on Jackson.

NURSE

(to Peter)

She's alright. She just fainted. We'll

have to check her for symptoms of shock.

If you want to wait, you can get some

coffee on the third floor.

PETER

No, I... I think I wanna go out for some

fresh air.

COP #1

That place is loaded with solvents and

chemicals. If we blast our way in, it's

gonna go up like a roman candle.

COP #2

We could go in through the fifth floor

wash room.

COP #1

What's that up there? Throw a light on

that!

COP #1

He's got a partner!

COP #2

(on radio)

We got an accomplice up there! And we

got a clear shot. Do we have a go?

RADIO

(filtered)

That's a go.

SPIDER-MAN

(cold, hard)

Say your prayers, Weiner!

WEINER

You ain't takin' me... Spider-Man... who

ever you are...

SPIDER-MAN

(hanging on ceiling)

Hey, creep!

SPIDER-MAN

(taunting)

Try again.

COP (V.O.)

(on bullhorn)

This is your last chance, you two.

Either you're coming out, or we're coming

in!

WEINER

(at the window)

Stay back!

(gun burst)

Whoa... stay back down there!

WEINER

Stand up, you.

COP (V.O.)

You have thirty seconds to come out!

WEINER

You're my ticket outa here. Gimme that

stupid mask!

WEINER

Then I'll take it myself.

SPIDER-MAN

Well, look what we've caught in our web...

WEINER

Don't hurt me, man. Please don't hurt me...

COP #1

Hold your fire!

WEINER

Get me out of this madhouse!

OCK

(smiling)

Okey, dokey.

OCK

(reading dials and numbers)

Amperage, okay. Flux, 14. Negative

variable differential... good enough.

OCK

Okey, dokey... now all I need is Parker's

data. Where the hell is Weiner? Damn it...

I can't trust anybody.

(throws his Waldo in the air)

Only you, my babies... only you can I

trust... Okay... If I have to do

everything myself... I'm going to do it.

(to his equipment)

I'll be back... my babies... my new

babies!

LIZ (V.O.)

Hey, Peter! Are you finished with my

computer yet? I got a paper too, you

know...

PETER

(panicked)

Oh my God... oh, it's you, Liz... I

didn't expect you... uh... give me a

minute.

PETER

(opening the door)

Hi, Liz. Come on in.

LIZ

What were you doing in here?

PETER

(looking around)

Cleaning up. Come on. I'll get your

computer. Where's Flash parked?

LIZ

Flash didn't come.

PETER

(holding it)

Oh. Well... how are you going to get it

home?

LIZ

Taxi... I guess.

LIZ

You must spend a lot of time with this

Spider-Man guy... Peter! Don't you think

you ought to unplug that!

PETER

(embarrassed)

I, uh, I'll go down to the corner... see

it I can hail that taxi.

LIZ

(crossing to it, wondering)

Peter...?

LIZ

Doctor Octavius...! You're... You're...

(finds the words)

You're so weird!... with those... what do

you call those...

OCK

Waldos... Did you hear about Spider-Man?

(moving Waldos like spider's legs)

That's me... the real Spider-Man... now

tell me, where is that jerky friend of

yours... Parker?

LIZ

(protecting)

Peter?... oh... he's not here. He's gone.

I don't think he'll be back for awhile.

OCK

(running his Waldo in her hair)

You wouldn't lie to your Professor now,

would you?

LIZ

Of course not. Why would I lie about a

thing like that? Really. He's... out.

OCK

We'll wait.

OCK grabs LIZ'S HAIR with his WALDOS.

LIZ

What are you doing... let me go! Please...

take those things out of my hair!

OCK

My Waldos, you mean.

LIZ

Whatever you call them... please...

OCK

Sit.

OCK

(chatty)

He's a nice boy. A little nerdy maybe,

but nice, wouldn't you say?

LIZ

Oh, I don't know. Maybe. He's very

inexperienced.

OCK

You know, you're a fascinating young lady...

LIZ

Thank you...

OCK

You're so refreshing. You're so...

LIZ

Shocking...?

OCK

(gone to far)

Oh, I wouldn't say shocking...

LIZ

I would!

LIZ

Peter...!

PETER

Wait here...

PETER

Liz?

LIZ (V.O.)

(screaming from the street)

Peter! Help! Peter!

OCK

Peter Parker has something I want... And

I'm going to have something he wants.

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)

Put her down, Ock.

SPIDER-MAN

I know what's happening to you, Ock.

I've been through a lot of changes myself

lately. You have to listen to me.

OCK

(holding Liz)

Who the hell are you?

SPIDER-MAN

Spider-Man.

LIZ

(seeing Spidey)

Spider-Man...

OCK

That's a lot of crap, clown... I am

Spider-Man, not you.

(points to Liz)

Ask you girlfriend.

(to Liz)

Tell him!

SPIDER-MAN

I'm a good friend of Peter Parker's Ock.

Just like that girl you're holding. Now

let her go.

OCK

Let her go? What an excellent idea. If

you do not deliver your friend, Mr.

Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I'll

let her go.

LIZ

Put me down, you mechanical mutant!

LIZ

(falling away)

You jerk!

LIZ

(straightening herself)

Tell your friend Peter next time I'll get

the taxi myself...

OCK

(screams)

Hey... you jerk... you phony Spider-Man...

Prepare to meet your death, bug.

SPIDER-MAN

(whispers)

Actually, I'm rather fond of living...

especially now...

(he looks at Liz)

SPIDER-MAN

(a last appeal to reason)

Octavius. Just stop and think.

OCK

I am thinking, insect. I'm thinking

about exterminating you!

SPIDER-MAN

Okay, if that's the way you want it...

Let's see what those chrome knuckles can

do, Doc...

LIZ

Great...

OCK

Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown.

OCK

Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one

will be able to stop me.

SPIDER-MAN

Stop you from what...?

OCK

My destiny!

SPIDER-MAN

Over here, Octopus!

OCK

That's Professor Octopus to you Spider

Jerk!

SPIDER-MAN

Give it up, Professor. You'll never

catch me!

SPIDER-MAN

So long, sucker.

COP #1

There he is!

COP #2

It's that Spider-Man!

LIZ

What do you think you're doing?

SPIDER-MAN

I'm rescuing you.

LIZ

Thanks but nooooooooooo!

COP #2

He won't get away this time!

COP #1

Hold your fire! He's got a girl.

COP #2

Looks like he's got a hostage.

LIZ

Wait a minute. Where are you taking me?

SPIDEY hounded by the Police, rejected by the girl.

SPIDER-MAN

I better just take you back where you

belong.

SPIDER-MAN

Hold on tight.

LIZ

(Times Square)

Where are we?

SPIDER-MAN

Open your eyes.

LIZ

(the Empire State Building)

If you're trying to impress me Spidey, I

want you to know I'm not easy. Okay, I'm

impressed... now put me down, Spidey...

put me down.

SPIDER-MAN

I like the way you say Spidey... Nobody

calls me Spidey... now we go...

LIZ

(Tavern on the Green)

Wow... look, this is our dormitory. I

can get to my room. Hey, wait a minute...

there's Flash, if I'm not mistaken.

SPIDER-MAN

Liz?

LIZ

You know my name?

SPIDER-MAN

Liz, listen to me. There's something I

have to tell you.

LIZ

Okay, put me down and we can talk,

alright?

SPIDER-MAN

Do you know who I am?

LIZ

All I know is you're the Amazing

Spider-Man... or better you're Spidey the

good guy on the block... you're a weirdo

in a clown spider suit.

SPIDER-MAN

And that's all you know about me?

(a beat, a sigh)

Okay, lets get your boyfriend.

LIZ

Which one?

SPIDER-MAN

How many do you have? I meant Flash.

LIZ

Well, Flash is not exactly my boyfriend...

SPIDER-MAN

He's not? Then who is?

LIZ

There's someone I like, but he's too shy

to notice.

(Flash appears)

SPIDER-MAN

Flash!

FLASH

Liz!

(a beat)

SPIDER-MAN!!!

LIZ

(to Spider-Man)

You know everybody... Flash we have to

call Peter!

FLASH

Hey, they won't let up, man!

(shows Daily Bugle)

They keep calling you an accomplice in

that burglary murder. But that's a crock,

ain't it? I'm with you, Spidey, 100%

SPIDER-MAN

Thanks.

FLASH

(realizing)

By the way, what are you doing with...

Liz?

SPIDER-MAN

She needed a lift.

FLASH

Oh... okay! This calls for a beer! A

lot of beer!

SPIDER-MAN

Thanks, but I have some business to take

care of.

FLASH

Well... take care of that later. Wait

here. I'll get the beer.

LIZ

(accusatory)

How'd you know this was Flash's place?

SPIDER-MAN

Peter Parker told me all about it.

LIZ

Peter told you all about Flash?

SPIDER-MAN

No... he told me all about you. See you

later.

(he jumps away)

FLASH

Hey, where'd he go? Hey, Spider-Man!!

LIZ

(distracted)

Peter told your Hero all about me...

FLASH

He would, wouldn't he... that jerk!

PETER

(whispers angrily)

Octavius!!!

PETER

(hurrying by)

Kim! Have you seen Harry?

KIM

Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac...

PETER

Yeah... have you seen him today?

KIM

No, un unh.

LIZ

(catching up)

Peter...!

PETER

(keeps walking)

Hi... have you seen Harry?

LIZ

No. What a night, huh?

PETER

(laughs)

Yeah, that was some ride home... must

have been pretty exciting.

LIZ

It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets

to Les Miserables... wanna go?

PETER

Sorry... I'm really busy... I mean, not

tonight... see you later.

LIZ

(thinking)

Hey, Peter... how did you know about last

night...?

PETER

What about last night?

LIZ

My exciting ride with Spider-Man...

PETER

Oh... Sorry... I gotta hurry... I have to

find Harry... I'll see you later.

LIZ

Peter!

PETER

Hey! Can I get a lift downtown?

FLASH

Take your shoes for a walk, Dork.

OCK

We are new inserting Peter Parker's data

on tonight's Planetary Conjunction.

OCK

Yes, yes! Go on! Go on!

OCK

Enormous. It's enormous.

(to recorder)

The Parker calculations add 4%

gravitational force at the moment of full

Planetary Conjunction.

(hits some keys)

Adding this to present maximum power

potential, I get...

OCK

I knew it. I knew it! Universal

destruction! It's doable! I am putting

a countdown clock on the Planetary

Conjunction now!

OCK

(playing the computer)

Okey, dokey. Now let's see if I have

enough power to drive this beast.

PETER

(pulling Harry aside)

I gotta remember to have that fixed.

(opens the door)

There you are, I've been looking for you

all over town.

HARRY

What happened?

PETER

Where were you?

HARRY

I went to the wrestling, wanted to see

that Amazing Spider-Man, but he didn't

show up.

PETER

Listen, Harry something terrible happened.

HARRY

What? What?

PETER

My Planetary Conjunction papers... they

were stolen...

HARRY

Oh my God... Are you sure...? Who would

do such a thing?

PETER

Ock...

HARRY

Of course... but why...?

PETER

We have to find out, sit down.

(indicates computer)

I want to access Dr. Octavius' main

program. I want to know about his

experiments with the cyclotron. Can you

do it?

HARRY

(starts hacking)

I can try. I could access the system in

the dorm. Okay. And through that I

could crack the main line.

PETER

Alright. Now if we can just disrupt the

Octavius file...

HARRY

Okay, let's try.

PETER

Yeah?

JAMESON (V.O.)

Parker? Peter Parker? This is J. Jonah

Jameson!

PETER

(looking over Harry's shoulder)

Mr. Jameson, you got me at a bad time.

JAMESON (V.O.)

I need pictures of your friend, the

Amazing Spider-Man. But I need bad guy

shots, you got it? Lots of bad guy shots.

We're gonna pin that insect to the wall.

Whaddaya say?

JAMESON

What about that kid? On the job already?

OCK

Fusion cells...? All up. Internal

temperature... okay. Risk?

(a long beat)

Acceptable.

(another beat)

Let's fly.

HARRY

Got something!

PETER

What is it?

HARRY

Let me see. It's some kind of countdown

clock.

PETER

Countdown to what?

HARRY

I don't know, but whatever it is, it's

only six hours away.

PETER

The Planetary Conjunction?

HARRY

Could be...

PETER

Or Doc Ock's end of the world experiment...

Or both!

HARRY

Wait a minute. You're not telling me you

think the world is gonna end tonight...?

PETER

You want to wait around till midnight to

find out?

HARRY

No, but...

PETER

Let's see what else we've got.

HARRY

What's that?

PETER

It might be a calculation of the amount

of power he needs to create the hole

between the force and the anti-force.

HARRY

That's a lot of energy. What could

generate power like that?

PETER

The closest you could come is the New

York City Subway System.

(together)

We gotta talk to Professor Rosomorf!!

ROZ

Plutonium...

GIRL

What's going on?

WOMAN

Oh my God!

MAN

Get back! Get back!

WOMAN

Henry!!!

WOMAN

What are you doing here? Get out of here!

Get out of here!

WOMAN

It's Spider-Man!

TRUCK DRIVER #1

Get outa here, you bum!

WOMAN

Hey, what are you talking about?!

TRUCK DRIVER #2

(back at woman)

What's the matter, lady don't you read

the papers?

MAN

Go Spidey! Go!

SPIDER-MAN

Hello, everybody...

SPIDER-MAN

Okay, everyone, stand back and stay cool.

WOMAN

(whining)

Is that the real Spider-Man?

SPIDER-MAN

Somebody wanna give me a hand with this?

SPIDER-MAN

On three. One... Two... Three!

SPIDER-MAN

Have a nice evening, Ma'am... and you

too, Henry.

SPIDER-MAN

Okay, folks, just hang on...

SPIDER-MAN

Okay, one at a time. You first, Ma'am...

FIREMAN

(into walkie)

Gimme more ladder! I need more ladder!

ROZ

This is Doctor Otto Octavius' work. I

must get back to my university. I must

stop Ock... he's gone crazy. Can you

help me?

SPIDER-MAN

Sure thing, just don't take the train.

Come on... give me your hand.

ROZ

Spider-Man! Listen to me! If he can do

this with the train, if he's come this

far, then I can pretty well predict his

next step. He'll go to Plutonium SL 270

for the power. He must be stopped... or

else he'll destroy our world.

SPIDER-MAN

Let's get you out of here first,

Professor.

ROZ

Wait Spider-Man. I don't think I can

make it... You mustn't waste time saving

me... you must save the world! You must

go and stop Ock!

SPIDER-MAN

Where can I find him...?

ROZ

He is looking for Plutonium SL 270 I'm

sure...

SPIDER-MAN

Think Rosomorf, think where one can find

Plutonium? Where could he find SL 270...?

ROZ

(shouting)

There's only one place he can get the

Plutonium SL 270...

SPIDER-MAN

Where...?

ROZ

Toxic... toxic dump... any toxic dump

would have SL 270.

COP (V.O.)

Put your hands up, Spider-Man.

SPIDER-MAN

You're making a big mistake.

COP

And you're looking at twenty years.

COP

What the hell!

SPIDER-MAN

Must go on... must find Ock... SL 270

Plutonium... must get that crazy old

loony... before he gets to the

Plutonium... toxic dump... where are the

toxic dumps...?

AUNT MAY

You're as lovely as Peter said you were.

LIZ

(embarrassed)

Thank you. He really wanted so badly to

come see you. He called me up out of the

blue.

AUNT MAY

(great concern)

Tell me about Peter. What's he been up

to? He seems so preoccupied.

LIZ

Oh, you know Peter... he's all caught up

in some kind of study he's doing. Things

are really crazy at the university now.

Things are crazy... everywhere. I guess

Peter's just... well, you know... pulled

into his shell.

AUNT MAY

(reminiscing)

When Peter was little, he loved to hide.

In the closets. Under the sink. He

always needed a secret place. But when

I'd look for him, he'd always laugh... he

wanted to be found.

LIZ

Yeah... well. I don't think he wants me

to find him... Well, I'd better be going.

My friend Flash is picking me up.

AUNT MAY

This Flash... he isn't your boyfriend, is

he?

LIZ

No... not really... I think you can guess

why...

AUNT MAY

Elizabeth...?

She turns.

AUNT MAY

Finders keepers, losers weepers.

LIZ

What?

AUNT MAY

That's what I used to say to Peter when I

found him.

SPIDER-MAN

Got to find Ock... got to find the toxic

dumps.

(grabs his head)

Oh! Oh! Oh... yeah!

SPIDER-MAN

What's up, Ock?

OCK

You!!!

OCK

(on the run)

You're a doomed bug, Wall Crawler. I've

no time to waste on you now.

FEMALE COP

(gun poised)

Alright! Freeze! Up against the wall

and spread 'em

SPIDER-MAN

Hey, you big OCK, why don't you pick on

someone your own size?!

OCK

Alright Spider-Bug... here I've come for

you...

SPIDER-MAN

Hey, driver. Could you follow that red

Vette for me?

SPIDER-MAN

(swinging)

Flash Thompson... I never thought I'd be

happy to see you.

SPIDER-MAN

Sorry about that!

FLASH

Spider-man! This is unbelievable...!

SPIDER-MAN

Flash, I need your help.

FLASH

You got it.

SPIDER-MAN

You any good with this thing?

FLASH

I'm the best.

SPIDER-MAN

Okay... catch that Vette!

FLASH

Roger, wilco, over and out.

FLASH

Why is he going to New Jersey, and who is

it in that shitty red car...

LIZ

Don't you recognize him... it's Ock!

SPIDER-MAN

New Jersey has the largest toxic waste

dump in the world.

FLASH

What does he want with toxic waste?

SPIDER-MAN

He's looking for Plutonium, my dear...

The car has to slow down... it's in a traffic jam.

FLASH

Sorry... can't do anything about this

traffic.

SPIDER-MAN

Try to stay with me. I don't want to

lose him!

SPIDER-MAN

Bingo.

OCK

Okey, dokey...

SPIDER-MAN

Open that now, and you'll spoil Christmas.

OCK

Insect! I am going to squash you to

death... Once I lay my Waldos on your

skinny bones...

OCK

Goodbye, Spider-Man!

SPIDER-MAN

Noooooooooooooo!

SPIDER-MAN

(to himself)

Okay now, Spidey. Easy does it.

SPIDER-MAN

(to himself)

Don't give up, Spidey. Don't give up.

SPIDER-MAN

Empty... now what do I do?

OCK

So you've avoided the nuclear pool, have

you, Spider-Man?

SPIDER-MAN

Well, so far so good. But I can't hold

on much longer.

OCK

Pity...!

SPIDER-MAN

Oh, come on, Ock, be a good sport. Let's

talk this over face to face... throw me a

line...

OCK

Okay... face to face... Catch this!

FLASH

Don't do it, Professor!

OCK

(puts down the drum)

I know you... and you, young lady. Both

of you are in my physic class, aren't

you...? Come... you can help me. I need

to get some of these drums to my

laboratory... help me... and I'll give

you special grades. What'd you say?

LIZ

Leave him alone!!!

ROZ

Leave them alone Otto!

OCK

But, they won't help me. Everybody is

trying to destroy my experiment. And so

are you, Rosomorf.

ROZ

Otto... I was wrong. I've gone over your

research. It's brilliant, Otto. It's

mad, but it's brilliant. You have much

work left to do. I want to help you,

Otto. For the sake of science, go and do

your experiment. Leave... these kids

alone and I'll help you.

OCK

You will? You too?

OCK

Help me with these drums, I need to get

them to my laboratory immediately.

ROZ

Do as he says.

OCK

Drive, Flash, before I flush your girl

right down the toilet!

SPIDER-MAN

Professor Rosomorf, it's no good, double

dealing... why did you help him...?

ROZ

Don't lose your energy screaming. Catch

this rope and climb up, come on!

ROZ

I've been through the Octavius data. He

has enough power with his Plutonium.

Especially if he gets his hands on

Parker's data, there he has enough power

to do what he wants to do. And we are

not going to stop him in time before the

Planetary Conjunction occurs tonight...

SPIDER-MAN

Stop the car. I have an idea.

SPIDER-MAN

Do you have a dime?

PETER

Harry?!

HARRY

Peter, where are you?

SPIDER-MAN

Listen, Harry. You must get my paper

before Ock uses it...

HARRY

Your Planetary Conjunction data? It's

too late... Ock's got your paper, it's in

his computer already.

HARRY

But don't worry... he can never use it

without Plutonium.

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)

He's got the Plutonium, and he's on his

way back to the lab! And he's got two

prisoners with him... Liz and Flash!

HARRY

Don't worry... he needs a huge amount of

power... thousands of volts of

electricity... to get to the Anti-Force.

SPIDER-MAN

He can get to the power. Electrical

power... to the max. Nuclear power... SL

270. And now, at the moment of full

Planetary Conjunction. When all the

planets line up with the sun... maximum

gravitational power. The Conjunction is

Ock's final power source.

HARRY

Damn... the Conjunction is due at

midnight! What are we going to do?

OCK

Okey, dokey... have fun, young ones...

for the last time.

LIZ

(still ministering)

What do we do now?

FLASH

We kiss the world goodbye. If he is

right, all there is left to do is...

LIZ

Wait... I think I can release my right

hand...

HARRY

How much time is left? Wait... I can

find out... my God... 59 minutes!

SPIDER-MAN

The only way we can interfere with Ock's

plan is to find a computer center... fast.

HARRY (V.O.)

Our University has the biggest center in

town.

SPIDER-MAN

Yeah, but who's gonna work 'em?

HARRY

I think I can get some help... I can

teach anyone how to work a code in five

minutes.

SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)

Then do it!

KIM

Hey, this is easy.

FLASH

Hey, Harry I need help.

HARRY

Coming!

KIM

I got one! I got one!

LIZ

Harry! Get over here!

HARRY

A goddamn water leak...

FLASH

Hey, look at this. Empire State

University. This is our cyclotron,

right?

HARRY

(serious)

What does it say?

FLASH

(hits two keys)

It says "no information on net."

HARRY

Damn... we can't do it...

KIM

You mean... we can't stop loony Ock...

HARRY

I mean the world is in danger...

FLASH

We must find Peter, he knows these

computers better than all of us.

HARRY

Yes, but where the hell is he?

LIZ

(mysteriously)

I bet he is with Spider-Man...

LIZ

Look at the moon... I have never seen it

so big.

FLASH

What is that...

HARRY

Must be the sun.

SPIDER-MAN

It's started. Step on it Professor, or

we'll never make it.

ROZ

Our campus... right there... see those

beams from Ock's lab. We're late... it's

coming... the Conjunction will happen in

a few seconds.

SPIDER-MAN

Stop the car...! Come with me.

ROZ

Where...? What...?

OCK

(looking back, madly)

Aha! You never included the Conjunction

in your calculations, did you?! Rosomorf!

ROZ

Damn the calculations! My God, Otto, you

have to hear me! The world we know will

collapse! Everything we have devoted our

lives to... all the patterns, all the

harmonies... everything will be destroyed.

OCK

A new world waits! Rosomorf! It is my

destiny!!!

ROZ

It is cosmic suicide! You have no right!

ROZ

You have to stop him... Spider-Man you

have to stop him.

SPIDER-MAN

I'm afraid we're too late.

LIZ

He's in there. I know Peter is in there.

She breaks into a run.

FLASH

Liz, don't... Liz come back... come back!

LIZ runs inside. They run after her. A BOLT OF

ELECTRICITY flashes across the doorway, stopping them.

OCK

Okey, dokey!! My energy storm has

started. My Anti-Force is on! History

is being made... Spider-Man, Rosomorf

cheer up friends... we're on our way to

the unknown cosmos... we three are about

to visit heaven... real Gods heaven.

ROZ

(sees the sky through the window)

Spider-Man! The Conjunction! It's

happening!

LIZ

Peter! Peter, where are you?!

FLASH

(screaming)

Liz! Liz come on out!

HARRY

Get back! Flash... get back!

FLASH

Wow...!

LIZ

Peter!

FLASH

Oh my God... Liz is inside there!

HARRY

And Professor Rosomorf and crazy Ock.

FLASH

What about Peter? Is he there with them?

HARRY

No, but I bet Spider-Man is.

MAX

That's some show... if ever I saw one.

JAMESON

(shouting)

Tear out the front page! Change the

headline... The biggest news is happening

right now... we need photos... a camera...

get me a camera...!

ROZ

Where is it going Otto?

OCK

Other worlds, Roz, other times, other

dimensions, who knows? Who cares?

ROZ

Then... why?

OCK

Truth, Rosomorf. Look at it! The new

truth! The new way!

SPIDER-MAN

Don't listen to him Professor Roz.

OCK

No, you don't listen to that clown, he

can't save you, or the world for that

matter.

OCK

Once and for all, Spider-Man... once and

for all we'll end the legend of your

powers.

OCK

(ultimate betrayal)

You!! You were my teacher!!!

OCK

You were my teacher! And you want to

destroy my experiment. You are a

scientist for heaven sake... don't you

want to know what's up there?

ROZ

Yes, but not on account of our world. We

have only one world... only one life.

The floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a

hole on a pond. BANG! BANG! SPIDEY comes to just as the

section of floor beneath himself and ROZ gives way and

falls through.

ROZ

(calling back from the dark skies)

Spider-Man! Only you can save us now...

SPIDER-MAN

Roz!!!

(turns to Ock)

Murderer!!!

OCK

Forget that old fool, insect. My

Spider-Man... Come join me on my

fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven.

LIZ

Peter! Peter!

SPIDER-MAN

Let's have it, old boy!

A bizarre DUEL takes place. The CENTER pitches this way

and that. SPIDEY and OCK move from foothold to foothold,

from WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET.

SPIDER-MAN

Liz!!

OCK seizes the opportunity to whack SPIDEY across the

head. SPIDEY loses his footing but the building now

lurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside. SPIDEY

ducks inside too and pulls the GRATE.

SPIDER-MAN

Come on.

LIZ

Where's Peter? He must be here somewhere.

SPIDER-MAN

(pulling her ahead)

He's around, don't worry... we'll find

him.

LIZ

This building is flying. I'm in a

goddamn flying building...

SPIDER-MAN

I think we have to pull some of these

cables. Try those over there. I'll work

on these. We gotta slow this thing down

somehow. We got helicopters coming.

SPIDER-MAN

Pull!

LIZ

Oh my God...

SPIDER-MAN

The power!

OCK

Spider-Man. You're end is coming. Life

in its present form is ending... new

dimensions, new horizons...

LIZ

(bracing against the storm)

What is happening?

SPIDER-MAN

(similarly braced)

I don't know!!!

LIZ

I can't... hold on!

SPIDER-MAN

Hold tight, Liz, hold tight!

OCK

(spaced out)

You cut my power... there's too little

power... It's so tiny... so tiny...

there's only space... for me. But I've

done it, Spider-Man. I have broken

through... I've broken through!

LIZ

Don't do it, Dr. Octavius!

OCK

Okey... dokey... Now that's what I call

an experiment!!!

SPIDER-MAN

I can't control her. She's dropping too

fast! Alright... let's go!

LIZ

But what about Peter? We've got to find

Peter!

SPIDER-MAN

Peter will be okay, I promise you...

Let's go before it's too late.

(he grabs her)

LIZ

Go where?

SPIDER-MAN

Maybe there's another way...

LIZ

It's breaking apart!

SPIDER-MAN

Alright, keep moving, a step at a time!

LIZ

We have to go back.

SPIDER-MAN

We can't go back.

LIZ

Forget it...

SPIDER-MAN

Okay, have it your way.

LIZ

(shouting across)

What am I supposed to do with this!

SPIDER-MAN

(shouting back)

Go ahead. It's easier than it looks!

We've got to try the fire escape.

LIZ

The door is stuck.

PETER (V.O.)

Liz, Up here!

PETER

Come on. I've found a way down.

LIZ

(at long last, love)

I knew you were going to say that.

LIZ

Where's the way out?

PETER

Right there!

PETER

Come on, help me with this.

PETER

Okay, stand still.

LIZ

Is this going to work?

PETER

How do I know?

LIZ

I just adore confidence in a man.

PETER

Come on...

LIZ

What is it you say when you jump?

PETER

Your prayers.

LIZ

We have a lot to thank your friend

Spider-Man for.

PETER

Somehow, I don't think we've seen the

last of him.

LIZ

Peter...! Finders, keepers...

PETER

What...? What is it? Why do you look

like that?

LIZ

I think I'm in love.

PETER

(even his eyes blush)

You are...

LIZ

With your friend...

PETER

Spider-Man? You're in love with

Spider-Man?

LIZ

I am... you think we'll see him again?

PETER

We might... you never know.

He kisses her.

LIZ

Oh.

(bittersweet)

This may be the end of a beautiful

friendship you know?

PETER

Nah.
