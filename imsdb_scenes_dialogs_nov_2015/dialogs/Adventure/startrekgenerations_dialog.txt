CHEKOV

(points to sky)

There he is -- there, to the

South!

SCOTTY

(peers upward)

What are ye, blind? That's a

bird.

SCOTTY

(concerned)

Repelling the Crystalline

Trench... rafting down lava

flows... orbital skydiving. it's

like the man is running a bloody

decathlon across the galaxy.

CHEKOV

(re: sound)

That should be him now. I think

he's just crossed the sound

barrier.

KIRK

Right on target! I jump out over

the Arabian Peninsula... and I end

up here, right on the dime.

CHEKOV

Actually, Captain, your precise

target area was thirty-five

meters...

(points)

That way.

KIRK

Thanks for pointing that out.

KIRK

Oh...

SCOTTY

I've warned ye about that back of

yours. You should have a doctor

take a look at it.

KIRK

Tomorrow I want to make a tri-

elliptical jump. That's where you

jump out over Northern China, and

make three complete orbits before

you start re-entry...

CHEKOV

Captain. Perhaps you have

forgotten that tomorrow is the

christening ceremony.

KIRK

I'm not going.

(beat)

Scotty, help me with this chute.

SCOTTY

What do you mean, you're not

going? We promised.

KIRK

When I retired, I swore I'd never

set foot on a starship again, and

I meant it.

CHEKOV

Captain...

KIRK

(firm)

I don't want to hear anymore about

it. I'm not going, and that's

final.

JOURNALISTS

(overlapping)

Captain Kirk, how does it feel

to be back on the Enterprise

Bridge... Captain, can I have a

Minute... Captain Scott, do you

have any comment on... Commander

Chekov... etc.

HARRIMAN

Excuse me, excuse me...there will

be plenty of time for questions

later...

HARRIMAN

(continuing, to all)

I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd

like to welcome you all aboard.

KIRK

It's our pleasure.

HARRIMAN

I just want you to know how

excited we all are to have a group

of living legends with us on our

maiden voyage.

(beat)

I remember reading about your

missions when I was in grade

school.

KIRK

Well... may we have a look around?

HARRIMAN

Please... please.

CHEKOV

Demora!

JOURNALIST

(breezy)

So, Captain... this is the first

Starship Enterprise in thirty

years without James T. Kirk in

command. How do you feel about

that?

KIRK

Just fine. I'm glad to be here to

send her on her way...

JOURNALIST

What have you been doing since you

retired?

KIRK

I've been... keeping busy.

CHEKOV

(to Kirk)

Excuse me, Captain. I'd like you

to meet the Helmsman of the

Enterprise-B. Ensign Demora Sulu --

Captain James Kirk.

DEMORA

It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

My father's told me some...

interesting stories about you.

KIRK

Your father... Hikaru Sulu is your

father?

DEMORA

Yes, sir.

CHEKOV

You met her once before, but she

was...

KIRK

But that wasn't so long ago... it

couldn't have been more than...

CHEKOV

Twelve years, sir.

KIRK

Yes... well... congratulations,

Ensign. It wouldn't be the

Enterprise without a Sulu at the

helm.

DEMORA

Thank you, sir.

(to Chekov)

Let me show you the new inertial

guidance system.

SCOTTY

(to Kirk)

Damn fine ship if you ask me...

KIRK

You know, Scotty... it amazes me.

SCOTTY

And what would that be, sir?

KIRK

Sulu. When did he find the time

for a family?

SCOTTY

It's like you always said -- if

something's important enough, you

make the time.

SCOTTY

So... that's why you've been

running around the galaxy like an

eighteen-year-old. Finding

retirement a little lonely, are we?

KIRK

With that kind of tact, I'm glad

you're an engineer and not a

psychiatrist.

HARRIMAN

Excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll

take your seats.

KIRK

Oh... of course.

HARRIMAN

(to all)

Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft

thrusters ahead one quarter, port

and starboard at station keeping.

(beat)

Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if

you would give the order to get

underway.

KIRK

No... no. Thank you.

HARRIMAN

Please, I insist.

KIRK

(to all)

Take us out.

CHEKOV

(sotto)

Very good, sir.

SCOTTY

(sotto)

Brought a tear to my eye.

HARRIMAN

Well... we've just cleared the

asteroid belt. Our course will

take us out beyond Pluto and then

back to spacedock. Just a quick

run around the block.

(beat)

If we have time, we'll conduct a

few tests of the warp --

COM OFFICER

(to Harriman)

We're picking up a distress call,

Captain.

HARRIMAN

On speakers.

COM VOICE

(fritzed)

This is the transport ship Lakul.

We're caught in some kind of

energy distortion. We can't break

free... need immediate help...

It' tearing us --

SCIENCE OFFICER

The Lakul is one of two ships

transporting El-Aurian refugees to

Earth.

HARRIMAN

Can you locate them?

DEMORA

The ships are bearing at three one

zero mark two one five. Distance:

Three light years.

HARRIMAN

Signal the closest starship.

We're in no condition to mount a

rescue... We don't even have a

full crew aboard.

NAVIGATOR

We're the only one in range, sir.

HARRIMAN

Well, then... I guess it's up to

us.

(to Demora)

Helm, lay in an intercept course

and engage at maximum warp.

SCOTTY

Is there something wrong with your

chair, Captain?

DEMORA

We're within visual range of the

energy distortion, Captain.

HARRIMAN

On screen.

CHEKOV

What the hell is that?

DEMORA

(off console)

I've found the transport ships.

15A   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)                                 15A

DEMORA

(cont'd)

Their hulls are starting to buckle

under the stress -- they won't

survive much longer.

NAVIGATOR

We're encountering severe

gravimetric distortions from the

energy ribbon.

HARRIMAN

We'll have to keep our distance...

we don't want to get pulled in

too...

KIRK

Tractor beam...

HARRIMAN

We don't have a tractor beam.

KIRK

You left spacedock without a

tractor beam?

HARRIMAN

It won't be installed until

Tuesday.

(beat)

Ensign Sulu... try generating a

subspace field around the ships.

That might break them free.

DEMORA

Aye, sir.

DEMORA

(continuing; shakes her

head)

There's too much quantum

interference, Captain.

HARRIMAN

What about... venting plasma from

the warp nacelles? That might

disrupt the ribbon's hold on the

ships.

NAVIGATOR

Aye, sir.. releasing drive

plasma...

NAVIGATOR

(continuing)

It's not having any effect, sir.

I think --

DEMORA

Sir! The starboard vessel's hull

is collapsing --

15B   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)                                 15B

CHEKOV

How many people were aboard

that ship?

DEMORA

Two hundred sixty-five.

DEMORA

(urgent)

The Lakul's hull integrity is down

to twelve percent, sir.

HARRIMAN

Captain Kirk... I would appreciate

any... suggestions you might have.

KIRK

(sotto)

First -- move us within

transporter range and beam those

people to the Enterprise.

HARRIMAN

What about the gravimetric

distortions? They'll tear us

apart...

KIRK

(gently)

Risk is part of the game if you

want to sit in that chair.

HARRIMAN

Helm, close to within transporter

range.

KIRK

And second -- turn that damned

thing off.

DEMORA

We're within range, sir.

HARRIMAN

(to lieutenant)

Beam them directly to Sickbay.

CHEKOV

(concerned)

How big's your medical staff?

HARRIMAN

(embarrassed)

The medical staff... doesn't

arrive until Tuesday.

CHEKOV

You and you. You've just become

nurses. Let's go.

DEMORA

Main Engineering reports

fluctuations in the warp plasma

relays.

SCOTTY

By-pass the relays and go to

auxiliary systems.

LIEUTENANT

Sir, I'm having trouble locking

onto them. They appear to be...

in some sort of... temporal flux.

KIRK

Scotty?

SCOTTY

What the hell...

SCOTTY

Their life signs are... are

phasing in and out of our

space-time continuum.

KIRK

Phasing? To where?

NAVIGATOR

Sir! Their hull's collapsing!

19   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  19

SCOTTY

I got forty-seven of them...

(beat, grim)

... out of one hundred fifty.

KIRK

Report!

DEMORA

We're caught in a gravimetric

field emanating from the trailing

edge of the ribbon.

HARRIMAN

All engines, full reverse!

SURVIVORS

(incoherent, overlapping)

The colors are touching me... I'm

caught in the glass... Help me...

I can see the seconds... Over

here... etc

CHEKOV

It will be all right. We're going

to take care of you.

CHEKOV

(off tricorder)

Only minor injuries so far...

(beat)

But it looks like they're all

suffering from some kind of

neural shock.

SORAN

Why...why?

JOURNALIST

It's all right... you're safe...

you're on the Enterprise.

SORAN

No... I have to go... I have to

get back... You don't understand!

Let me go!

JOURNALIST

What was he talking about?

CHEKOV

Easy there...

CHEKOV

It's going to be okay. Here, just

lie down.

22   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE (VFX-I)                          22

DEMORA

Inertial dampers failing.

SCOTTY

Engines not responding!

HARRIMAN

(quiet)

I didn't expect to die my first

day on the job.

KIRK

(sotto)

The first thing you learn as

Captain is how to cheat death.

(beat, then louder)

Scotty?

SCOTTY

(outraged)

There's just no way to disrupt a

gravimetric field of this

magnitude!

DEMORA

Hull integrity failing.

SCOTTY

(continuing)

But I do have a theory...

KIRK

I thought you might.

SCOTTY

An anti-matter discharge directly

ahead... it might disrupt the

field long enough for us to break

away.

KIRK

A photon torpedo?

SCOTTY

Aye.

KIRK

(quickly, to Demora)

Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire

on my command.

DEMORA

Captain... we don't have any

torpedoes.

KIRK

Don't tell me... Tuesday.

SCOTTY

Captain, it may be possible to

simulate a torpedo blast using a

resonance burst from the main

deflector dish.

KIRK

(onto the idea)

Where are the deflector relays?

DEMORA

Deck fifteen, section twenty-one

alpha

HARRIMAN

(to Kirk)

I'll go. You have the Bridge.

KIRK

No... a Captain's place is on the

Bridge of his ship.

(beat)

I'll take care of it.

KIRK

(on the move, to Scotty)

Keep her together until I get

back.

SCOTTY

(matter of fact)

I always do.

You did it, Kirk!

(to Demora)

Damage report, Ensign.

DEMORA

There's some buckling on the

starboard nacelle...

(reacts)

We've also got a hull breach in

the Engineering section.

Emergency forcefields are in place

Mister Worf... I always knew this

day would come. Are you prepared

to face the charges?

TROI

Answer him!

WORF

I am prepared.

RIKER

"We, the officers and crew of the

U.S.S. Enterprise, being of sound

mind and judgment, hereby make

the following charges against

Lieutenant Worf: One. That he did

knowingly and willfully perform

above and beyond the call of duty

on countless occasions. Two.

That he has been a good and solid

officer on this ship for one score

less twelve years. And Three.

Most seriously... that he has

earned the respect and admiration

of the entire crew."

PICARD

There can be only one punishment

for such crimes...

(beat)

I hereby promote you to the rank

of Lieutenant Commander, with all

the rights and privileges thereto.

And may God have mercy on your

soul.

PICARD

(cont'd)

Congratulations, Commander.

WORF

(smiles)

Thank you, sir.

RIKER

Extend the plank!!

CREWMEMBERS

Into the sea with him... feed him

to the sharks... walk the

plank... etc.

PICARD

Don't you think you're taking this

a little too far, Number One?

RIKER

When we went to ancient Rome for

Deanna's promotion, we threw her

to the lions, remember?

WORF

WAIT!!

WORF

convincing.

DATA

(to Beverly)

Doctor, I must confess I am

uncertain as to why pushing

someone into freezing, shark-

infested water is amusing.

It's all done in good fun, Data.

Get in the spirit of things.

Ah.

Number One, bring the ship before

SORAN

My instincts tell me you're lying.

And I know that can't be easy for

you...

(off PADD)

I can see you have a good heart.

SORAN

Oh... I forgot to tell you. While

you were unconscious, I injected

a nano-probe into your

bloodstream. It's been navigating

your cardiovascular system... and

right now I've attached it to your

left ventricle.

(smiles)

A little trick I picked up

from the Borg.

GEORDI

(gasping)

Yeah... they're full of great

ideas.

SORAN

I just stopped your heart for five

seconds. It felt like an

eternity, didn't it? Did you know

that you can stop the human heart

for up to ten minutes before the

onset of brain damage?

GEORDI

No... I didn't know that...

SORAN

We learn something new about

ourselves every day.

(beat)

Now. Maybe I didn't make myself

clear. It is very important that

you tell me exactly what Captain

Picard knows.

GEORDI

I told you everything... you might

as well just kill me right now...

SORAN

I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge.

DATA

According to our information, the

ribbon is a conflux of temporal

energy which travels through our

galaxy every thirty-nine point one

years

PICARD

When is it expected back?

PICARD

Data?

DATA

Sorry, Captain. The Ribbon has

already entered the galaxy. It

will pass through this sector in

approximately thirty-one hours.

PICARD

Guinan said Soran was trying to

get back to the ribbon... if

that's true, then there must be

some connection with the Amargosa

star.

DATA

The star's destruction has had

numerous astro-physical effects

within this sector. However, none

of them appear to have a

connection to the energy ribbon.

PICARD

Give me a list of those effects.

I want to know every single thing

which has been altered or

changed... no matter how

insignificant...

DATA

It will take a few moments for the

computer to compile the

information.

PICARD

Data, are you all right?

DATA

No, sir. I am finding it

difficult to concentrate... I

believe I am overwhelmed with

feelings of... remorse and regret

concerning my actions on the

observatory.

PICARD

What do you mean?

DATA

I wanted to save Geordi... I

tried. but I experienced

something I did not expect.

(beat)

I believe it was fear.

PICARD

Fear is a very difficult emotion

to overcome. It's something we

all have to learn to deal with.

DATA

But I did not deal with it, sir.

I let it prevent me from helping

my friend.

(beat)

Does that make me a coward?

PICARD

No. And what you must try to

avoid is becoming consumed by

another emotion which I believe

you're beginning to experience...

guilt.

DATA

(considers)

Guilt. It is a most unpleasant

feeling.

According to our current

information, the destruction of

the Amargosa star has had the

following effects in this sector:

gamma emissions have increased by

five percent... the starship

Bozeman was forced to make a

course correction... a research

project on Gorik Four was

halted due to increased neutrino

particles... ambient magnetic

fields have decreased by --

PICARD

Wait. The Bozeman... why did it

change course?

DATA

(matter of fact)

The destruction of the Amargosa

star has altered the gravitational

forces throughout the sector. Any

ship passing through this region

will have to make a minor course

correction.

PICARD

Doctor Crusher can remove this.

but you leave me no other choice.

I do not wish to remove the chip,

sir. Although these emotions are

proving difficult to deal with...

I cannot imagine going back to a

life without them. I have taken

an important step toward becoming

truly human. If I were to turn

back now...

I would like to continue in my

duties, sir.

I believe so.

changing its course.

(beat)

But why? Why try to alter its

path... why not simply fly into it

with a ship?

DATA

Our records show that every ship

which has approached the ribbon

has either been destroyed or

severely damaged.

PICARD

He can't go to the ribbon... so

he's trying to make the ribbon

come to him.

That's where he's going.

DATA

It should be noted, sir, that the

collapse of the Veridian star

would produce a shock wave similar

soften the blow...

(re: horseshoe)

you, but it's not. This isn't

Really your house. We've both

PICARD (V.O.)

(continuing)

Our casualties were light. but

unfortunately the Enterprise

herself cannot be salvaged.

OGAWA

That should be the last of the wounded,

Doctor.

BEVERLY

Two hundred thirty-two patients in

under two days.

BEVERLY

(calls out)

Save that stretcher...

OGAWA

Is there another patient?

BEVERLY

No -- that one's for me.

CUT TO:

181    INT. ANOTHER LOCATION                                      181

TROI

Over here, Data! I think I've

found something.

TROI

(off tricorder)

One life sign, very faint.

182   ANGLE ON DEBRIS                                            182

DATA

(relieved)

Spot.

DATA

I am very happy to find you, Spot.

TROI

Another family reunited.

TROI

Data... are you all right?

DATA

I am not sure, Counselor. I am

happy to see Spot... and yet I am

crying. My emotional program must

be malfunctioning again.

TROI

No, Data... I think it's working

perfectly.

CUT TO:

183   INT. READY ROOM - DAY                                      183

RIKER

Is this it?

PICARD

(relieved)

Yes, Number One. Thank you.

RIKER

I'm going to miss this ship. She

went before her time.

PICARD

It's not how many years you've

lived, Wil... but how you've lived

them.

(beat)

Someone once told me that time is

a predator that stalks us all our

lives. But maybe time is also a

companion who goes with us on

our journey, and reminds us to

cherish the moments of our

lives... because they will never

come again.

(beat)

We are after all. only mortal.

RIKER

Speak for yourself, sir. I kinda

planned on living forever.

184   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DAY (VFX-P)                             184

RIKER

I always thought I'd have a crack

at this chair one day.

PICARD

You may still... somehow I doubt

this will be the last ship to

carry the name Enterprise.

PICARD

(continuing, to com)

Picard to Farragut. Two to beam

up.

THE END
