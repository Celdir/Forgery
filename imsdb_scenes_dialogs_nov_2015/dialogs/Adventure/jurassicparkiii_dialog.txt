BEN

You make sure to get us as close as you can,

okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a

little extra.

ENRIQUE

Don't worry. I take you close. But not too

close.

(rubbing Eric's head)

You don't want them to eat you.

ENRIQUE (CONT'D)

Ready, amigos?

ERIC

What was that?

ERIC (CONT'D)

Ben!

BEN

Unclip your line!

4 	EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY 					4

CHILD (O.S.)

RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!

GRANT

Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are

herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in

fighting each other. But these...

(picking up two other dinosaurs)

See, these are carnivores. And this one here

-- see its claws -- this one here uses its

claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent...

ELLIE

(interrupting)

Uh, Alan?

GRANT

Hmm?

ELLIE

He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a

little older?

GRANT

Oh, right.

(back to Charlie)

Happy dinosaurs.

ELLIE

That must be Mark.

(calling out)

Mark, were back here!

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,

ELLIE (CONT'D)

Good day?

MARK

Keeping the world safe.

(re: baby)

Here, let me take her.

ELLIE

Mark, this is Alan Grant.

MARK

Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about

you.

CHARLIE

Daddy, this is a herbabore.

the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

GRANT

What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my

name Alan? Say my name.

The bird doesn't respond.

GRANT (CONT'D)

He used to know me.

ELLIE

Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

MARK

More coffee?

ELLIE

(relived)

Yes. Great.

ELLIE (CONT'D)

So, Mark's working at the State Department

now.

GRANT

Really?

(To Mark)

What do you do there?

MARK

(with mock bravado)

I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to

kill you.

GRANT

Indeed.

ELLIE

GRANT

ELLIE

Anything good?

GRANT

Raptors, mostly.

ELLIE

My favorite.

GRANT

You remember the sounds they made?

ELLIE

I try not to.

GRANT

We've done cranial scans, and raptors

actually had a quite sophisticated

resonating chamber. I have a theory that

their ability to vocalize is the key to their

social intelligence. The way they can work

together as a team.

ELLIE

You think they could talk to each other?

GRANT

To a degree we never imagined.

JACK

Bullshit!

ELLIE

You taught him that.

6 	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 					6

ELLIE

Good luck with the fund raising.

GRANT

It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,

you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils

are out. Everyone wants to see a real live

dinosaur.

ELLIE

Times change Alan. But you're the still the

best. I mean that.

GRANT

The last of my breed.

GRANT (CONT'D)

I'd better get going.

ELLIE

Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad

about asking for help, but please ask me.

Anything, anytime.

GRANT

(deep down knowing he never

will)

Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

ELLIE

Goodbye, Alan.

ELLIE (CONT'D)

When I met you, I thought that one day

millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs

became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me

otherwise. When conditions changed,

dinosaurs changed. They became other things.

They evolved.

GRANT

A well-accepted theory.

ELLIE

(simply)

Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

7 	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 						7

GRANT

It's through the painstaking study of the

Interior chamber in multiple specimens that

we can determine this exciting correlation

between the larynx and the upper plate. That

lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that

the raptor might have been capable of bird-

like vocalizations. Which as you can

imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

SYMPOSTIUM LEADER

Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does

anyone have a question?

GRANT

Does anyone have a question that doesn't

relate to Jurassic Park?

GRANT (cont'd)

Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll

remind you, I did not witness.

MALE STUDENT

Your theory on raptors is good and all, but

isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)

I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and

everyone decides how to handle the second

island, scientist will just go in and look

for themselves.

TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER

Isn't paleontology itself in danger of

extinction?

GRANT

No, and let me be perfectly clear on this

point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.

What's left of them is fossilized in stone

the actual scientists spend years to

undercover.

(MORE)

GRANT (CONT'D)

what John Hammond and InGen created are

theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing

less.

The class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

ANOTHER STUDENT

You're saying you wouldn't want to study

them if you had the chance?

GRANT

No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on

that island.

That's right, two of the very best I could

find. No, I haven't worked with them

personally, but they come with the highest

recommendations.

UDESKY (CONT'D)

You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This

is going to be a piece of cake.

Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right.

BILLY

You need to go slowly. See, just take it little

at a time.

CHERYL

I can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

BILLY

Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the

bones is replaced during fossilization. But

you can feel the difference. See? Rough,

smooth. Rough, smooth.

CHERYL

Rough.

CHERYL (cont'd)

Smooth.

BILLY

Dr. Grant!

GRANT

Mr. Brennan.

BILLY

How was your trip? Profitable?

GRANT

We'll be broke in four weeks.

BILLY

Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

GRANT

You rented an automated litter box.

BILLY

It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan

data from the raptor skull, than the computer

breaks it into thousands of slices which this

thing prints, one layer on top of the other.

It's the future of paleontology.

GRANT

Not if it can't dig.

BILLY

I give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

BILLY (cont'd)

(falsely casual)

Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors

wanted to come by and talk	to you. I

told them you'd be happy to see them.

maybe even have dinner with them.

GRANT

Absolutely not.

BILLY

They're here.

GRANT

What?

Who were walking up to them.

Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.

MAN

Dr. Grant?

GRANT

Yes?

GRANT

What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?

PAUL

Well sir, I am a great admirer

of yours, and I have an extremely interesting

proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife

and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.

GRANT

You know, I've been traveling and I'm very

tired. Maybe some other time.

PAUL

I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

GRANT

It's be my pleasure.

13 	INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT 	13

PAUL

First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,

Amanda and I have admired your work for

years.

AMANDA

It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

GRANT

Thank you.

PAUL

Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.

Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure

tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,

the Nile...

AMANDA

We even have two seats reserved aboard the

first commercial moon flight.

GRANT

Hmmm.

PAUL

Now, for our wedding anniversary this year

we wanted to do something really special,

something...

AMANDA

...once-in-a-lifetime.

PAUL

We've arranged for a private airplane to

take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want

you to be our guide.

GRANT

That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm

afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can

refer you to a number of highly qualified...

PAUL

No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've

seen these animals in the flesh. No one else

has come close to you.

GRANT

I'm flattered, but I've taken this little

adventure tour. And with the air

restrictions they've imposed after the

incident in San Diego, you cant fly low

enough to see anything of interest.

AMANDA

You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I

have special permission to fly low.

BILLY

How low?

PAUL

Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do

know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone

else.

AMANDA

From what I understand, it's pretty much

whatever we want.

GRANT

That's hard to believe.

PAUL

Let's just say that through my business --

imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've

made some friends in high places. In this

case, the Costa Rican government.

AMANDA

Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is

for us to have you come along. It would make

all the difference.

PUAL

And of course, we're prepared to make a

sizeable contribution to your research here.

PAUL (cont'd)

I can write all kinds of numbers on this

check. Just tell me what exactly it would

take.

CUT TO:

14 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							14

15 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							15

GRANT

Even with what I pay you, you could get a

better bag.

BILLY

No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago

some buddies and I went hang gliding off

these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me

right into the side. BOOM!

GRANT

That does sound lucky.

BILLY

It was this strap alone that saved my life.

Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

GRANT

Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most

idiotic.

BILLY

Listen Alan, I really appreciate you

bringing me along.

GRANT

The bones will be there when we get back.

That's the nice thing about them. They never

run away.

(beat)

And besides, you got me into this. I don't

intend to be alone with these people.

BILLY

So how do you know the Kirby's?

COOPER

Through our church.

BILLY

What Religion?

COOPER

Uh...the one that worships God and believes in being

Good.

What the hell is going on? What are they

doing?

PAUL

Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.

These guys are really good. One of them was a

Green...

GRANT

Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is

no such thing as safe. We have to get back in

this plane...

AMANDA

(on-bullhorn)

ERRR-IIIC!

GRANT

And tell your wife to stop making so

much noise! We're food to these damn

animals.

PAUL

(yelling)

Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad

idea!

AMANDA

(on the bullhorn)

What?

PAUL

(pointing broadly at Alan)

He says it's a bad idea!

AMANDA

(on the bullhorn)

What's a bad idea?

What was that?

Then a couple shots are heard.

Is it a rex?

I don't think so.

46	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							46

GRANT

Why did you bring us here?

AMANDA

Our son is on this island. We need your help

to find him.

PAUL

This is him. Eric. Hes thirteen now. He's

just about the greatest kid in the world.

AMANDA

He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

BILLY

Who's that?

PAUL

Her new boyfriend.

AMANDA

A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted

to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben

found a guy who would take them parasailing.

They never came back.

PAUL

We called everyone, did everything we could.

Because of all the controversy over this

island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says

it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault.

Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy --

said we should "accept the inevitable." You

believe that?

GRANT

So you hired these mercenaries.

UDESKY

We prefer "recovery specialists." We do

overseas custody issues and...

GRANT

(interrupting)

Then you duped us into coming here.

PAUL

We needed somebody who knew the lay of the

land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

GRANT

(disbelieving)

I have never been on this island!

PAUL

Sure you have. You wrote that book...

BILLY

That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna.

The second island.

PAUL

(low, to Udesky)

I didn't know, there were two islands.

AMANDA

Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You

saved those kids.

GRANT

A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we

were better prepared and better armed.

(finally)

How many days have they been missing?

PAUL

Eight weeks.

GRANT

After what you've seen today, you really

think your son could be alive?

AMANDA

He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much

about dinosaurs.

GRANT

No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we

can from the plane. Then we head for the

coast. There may be a boat left, something to

get us off this island.

PAUL

Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.

GRANT

You can stick with us, or you can go and look for

him. Either way you're probably not getting

out of here alive.

PAUL

What do we do?

UDESKY

Well, I think we should start searching for your

son. In the direction they're going.

PAUL

Excellent.

47	EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE						47

PAUL

Sorry.

AMANDA

Nothing you haven't seen before.

AMANDA (CONT'D)

How much weight have you lost?

PAUL

Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been

swimming at the Y.

AMANDA

You hate to swim.

PAUL

People change.

PAUL (CONT'D)

You look good.

AMANDA

So do you.

GRANT

How would you classify it?

BILLY

Obviously a superpredator.

(best guess)

Suchimimus. that snout.

GRANT

They never got that big.

BILLY

Baryonyx?

GRANT

Not with that sail.

(Billy gives up)

Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

BILLY

I don't remember that on InGen's list.

GRANT

That's because it wasn't on their list. Who

knows what else they were up to?

BILLY

So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,

did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

PAUL

Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

BILLY

About a thousand feet above it, actually.

(closer)

Most mountain-climbers remember how tall

that mountains were.

GRANT

There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

PAUL

There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint

and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate

Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The

"plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces

accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like

that.

BILLY

I don't suppose that check you wrote us is

any good.

UDESKY

He paid us half up front. Cash.

PAUL

Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even

the store. and if we make it off this island

with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the

money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me

the rest of my life.

UDESKY

However long that is.

AMANDA

Eric!

GRANT

Quiet!

PAUL

(loud whisper to Amanda)

Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous

territory.

AMANDA

Well we should split up or something. We can

cover twice the area.

PAUL

No, Dr. Grant says...

AMANDA

Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

PAUL

Well what's the use of hiring an expert if

your not going to listen to him?

AMANDA

Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric.

Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

PAUL

Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after

you, don't come crying to me.

AMANDA

Oh, don't worry about that.

PAUL

What?

AMANDA

Nothing.

PAUL

What did you say?

AMANDA

Nothing.

PAUL

What did you say!

AMANDA

Just drop it Paul!

If they split up, I'm going with you.

We should take it with us to signal any planes.

Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out

there'd be someone to keep him safe.

know this proves raptors raised their young

69B	EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY				69B

GRANT

What does that mean? What are you saying?

GRANT (CONT'D)

God damn you, Billy.

GRANT (CONT'D)

It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We

want the egg."

VOICE

Come on! They'll be back!

GRANT

Eric...

GRANT (CONT'D)

Eric, your parents are both here.

ERIC

In Costa Rica?

GRANT

On the island.

ERIC

They'll never make it. I mean, they can't

manage when the cable goes out.

GRANT

You'd be surprised what people can do when

they have too.

ERIC

You're Alan Grant, aren't you?

(off surprised reaction)

I read both of your books.

GRANT

Which one do you prefer?

ERIC

The first one. Before you where on the island.

You liked dinosaurs back then.

GRANT

Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

ERIC

When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of

stuff behind.

GRANT

Any weapons, radios?

ERIC

Found this, but the battery's dead.

GRANT

It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I

barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight

weeks.

ERIC

Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

GRANT

(trying to be positive)

The important thing is we both made it.

That's something we have in common.

GRANT (CONT'D)

Did you read Malcolm's book?

ERIC

Yeah.

GRANT

What did you think?

ERIC

I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.

Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the

guy seemed kind of high on himself.

GRANT

That's two things we have in common.

69F	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT						69F

AMANDA

We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr.

Grant are out there somewhere.

PAUL

I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit

of good right now. For every scary thing we

saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times

more of 'em at night.

(to Billy)

Am I right?

BILLY

I dont know.

PAUL

I thought you were an expert.

BILLY

Dr. Grant was.

AMANDA

Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to

have to figure out what to do ourselves.

AMANDA (cont'd)

So what do we do?

69G	EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT					69G

69H	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER)					69H

PAUL

I just want you know, Amanda. It's not

your fault what happened.

PAUL (cont'd)

Eric has always been headstrong, and you

throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well...

AMANDA

Well what?

PAUL

Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead.

What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy

accident. The exact same thing could have

happened if he was with me. You can't go

beating yourself up about it.

AMANDA

This wouldn't happen if he was with

you. I mean, you drive five miles below the

speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives

years.

PAUL

That one time was just the bumper.

AMANDA

He would have been, safe. Completely,

entirely, suffocatingly safe.

(beat)

I would have him to see more of the world than

Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the

world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's

my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that

you have to be here.

PAUL

I'm not sorry at all.

69I	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					69I

ERIC

Know what this is?

GRANT

(takes it)

A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

ERIC

Mine's new.

GRANT

How much of this island have you explored?

ERIC

I stayed pretty close to the compound,

Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's

where they'd start.

GRANT

We need to head for the coast.

ERIC

Are you sure?

GRANT

Why?

ERIC

Closer you get to the water, the bigger

things get.

69J	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69J

BILLY

We need to stick to the plan. Head for the

coast.

AMANDA

What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

BILLY

Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's

alive, thats where he's headed.

AMANDA

What about Eric?

PAUL

(rationalizing)

He's probably has a better chance by the coast

as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs

would live in the center of the island.

(to Billy)

Right?

BILLY

Sure.

69K	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69K

69L	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY					69L

PAUL

My phone.

AMANDA

You had the phone the whole time?

BILLY

Where is it?

PAUL

I don't know. I don't have it with me.

AMANDA

When did you have it last?

PAUL

I don't remember

AMANDA

Think.

PAUL

The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in

my coat pocket, and...

AMANDA

What?...WHAT!?

PAUL

I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on

him when he...

69M	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69M

ERIC

Mon! Dad!

AMANDA

(reassuring him)

Sweetheart, you're okay.

(reassuring herself)

You're okay.

(disbelieving)

You're okay.

PAUL

Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men,

we stick around, huh?

ERIC

We do.

PAUL

Honey, there's not enough spit in the world

for that.

GRANT

We need to keep moving.

BILLY

Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry

about the...

GRANT

Billy, I can't talk to you now.

BILLY

Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an

idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed

up because I know I did.

BILLY (CONT'D)

I thought if we could get a raptor back

to the mainland, we could get serious money

for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10

years. More. Whatever it took.

BILLY (CONT'D)

You have to believe me. I did it with the

best intentions.

GRANT

(finally turning on him)

Some of the worst things imaginable have

been done with the best intentions. You

rushed in with no thought to the

consequences, to yourself or anyone else.

(finally)

You're no better than the people who built

this place.

70	INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY					70

71	EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY						71

We climb down to the barge and follow the

river out to the ocean. With any luck, the

Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

ERIC

Then we go home?

AMANDA

Then we go home.

72	EXT. LANDING - DAY							72

AMANDA

You okay?

GRANT

How about if we try this way?

AMANDA

Do you think it goes all the way across?

GRANT

One way to find out.

GRANT (CONT'D)

(glancing back)

We'd better do this one at a time.

PAUL

Dr. Grant?

GRANT (O.S.)

Come on over. One at a time.

AMANDA

Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

PAUL

We're not going anywhere, I promise.

Amanda

We're all together now, Eric.

PAUL

My own kid was right in front of me and I

didn't do a damn thing.

AMANDA

You couldn't have made that jump.

PAUL

I should have tried. It should have been me

on that beach back there, not Billy.

AMANDA

How would you have helped Eric?

(he can't answer)

He needs you, Paul. He needs us.

PAUL

He could have died.

AMANDA

But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm

glad about that.

99A	UP ON THE BOW							99A

ERIC

Do you have any kids?

GRANT

No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

GRANT (CON'T)

I have a theory that there's two kinds of

boys. Those who want to be astronomers and

those who want to be astronauts.

ERIC

I want to be an astronaut.

GRANT

See, I was the opposite. I never understood

why anyone would want to go into space. It's

so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and

you're dead. The astronomer -- or the

paleontologist -- get to study these amazing

things from a place of complete safety. And

truthfully, everything you really need to

learn, you can learn it from the ground.

ERIC

But then you never get to go in space.

GRANT

Exactly. The difference between imagining

how things might be and seeing how they

really are. To be able to touch them. That's

what Billy wanted to do.

GRANT (cont'd)

I can blame the people who made this island.

But I can't blame the people who want to see

it. To study it.

GRANT (cont'd)

How's a boy suppose to resist this?

Find it before it stops ringing!

PAUL

I've got something. I think I've got

something!

AMANDA

I've got it! I've got it!

RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)

You too can own a time share in beautiful

Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four

star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or

just walk on the beach...

PAUL

Can't help but be a little offended.

102	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					102

PAUL

Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.

They won't do a God Damn thing.

GRANT

Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican

phone book here, so it will have to be

somebody we know in the states. Someone we

can absolutely count on to send help.

PAUL

(to Amanda)

Stan.

AMANDA

I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a

blizzard.

ERIC

What's that?

GRANT

Bonitas.

ERIC

Something must've scared them.

GRANT

Get the motor going.

AMANDA

Who are you calling?

Pick up! Pick up!

ERIC

We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

AMANDA

I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

ERIC

then we should...

AMANDA

Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,

okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave,

and he loves you ever very much.

ERIC

He loves you too.

AMANDA

Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know

that right now more than anything, your Dad

would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

AMANDA (CONT'D)

We're going to get out of this, and

everything's going to be all right, I promise.

Listen to your mother.

Good thing I've been swimming, huh?

PAUL

You remember when we went fishing last

summer? And I was trying to put the boat in

and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck

came and tried to pull it out, but it got

dragged in? And the truck driver threatened

to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I

was the governor and he believed me?

ERIC

Yeah.

PAUL

That was a fun day.

AMANDA

We should try fishing again.

PAUL

You mean it?

AMANDA

I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?

Things might turn out differently.

ERIC

The lady you called, how do you know she can

help us?

GRANT

She's the one person I could always count on.

And she's saved me more times than she

realizes. I owe her everything.

GRANT (CONT'D)

It's strikes me now I never told her that.

ERIC

You should.

GRANT

You're right.

GRANT (CONT'D)

Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?

that brought you here? Why did it crash?

ERIC

No. I couldn't see.

GRANT

Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a

minute, would you?

(pre-empting objections)

They look worried.

ERIC

(excited)

Mom! Dad!

PAUL

Helicopters. Helicopters!

ERIC

(yelling over)

Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

ERIC (CONT'D)

We're safe!

No we're not.

What do you think is going to happen with the

dinosaurs?

GRANT

The population will Stabilize eventually.

They'll adapt to fit different roles.

PAUL

Either that, or the government will firebomb

it back to the Stone Age.

AMANDA

I would completely support that.

ERIC

I hope they don't. I want to come back

someday.

GRANT

So do I.

EXT. OCEAN  DAWN

The helicopter flies away across the ocean, leaving the island behind.
