PIG NOSE #1

EVERYBODY on the floor!

BINOCULARS

Bingo.  We're on.  Let's go.

Where's the big college

quarterback?!  Are you with us,

Utah?

BINOCULARS (FILTERED)

Utah, where the hell are ya!?

PIG NOSE #1

Fuckin' shake it!

LADY PIGNOSE

Son of a bitch!

UTAH

Halt.  FBI!

PIG NOSE #1 (FBI CADET)

I wanna say just two words to you,

asshole, SIMU-LATION!!!  Johnny-

fuckin' Utah.  Guys like you will do

anything to win!

BINOCULARS

This far, Utah!  You're this far

from being the most overqualified

guy Burger King ever had.  Get me?!

UTAH

Yes sir.  Sir?

BINOCULARS

What?

UTAH

I did stop the perpetrators.

DISSOLVE TO:

DRIVER

Anywhere?  You don't care?

UTAH (V.O.)

Anywhere.  I've just never seen the

ocean before.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VOICE (OVER)

Day One in LA, special agent Utah.

You may have been top two percent of

your class at Quantico but you have

exactly zero hours in the field

here.  You know nothing...

HARP

You know less than nothing.  If you

even knew that you knew nothing, at

least that would be something, but

you don't.

UTAH

Yes, sir.

HARP

Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?

UTAH

Sir?

HARP

All the food groups?  Avoiding

sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that

my people maintain cardiovascular

fitness.  We stay off hard liquor,

cigarettes...

UTAH

(poker face)

I take the skin off chicken.

HARP

This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And

you're in the bank-robbery capital

of the world--

UTAH

1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26

percent from the year before.

HARP

That's right.  And we nailed over a

thousand of them.  We did it by

crunching data.  Good crime-scene

work, good lab work, good data-base

analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a

car once.  You getting the signal,

special agent?

UTAH

Zero distortion, sir.

UTAH

I love these things.

HARP

You're a real blue-flame special,

aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why

they sent you to LA.  Must be an

asshole shortage.

UTAH

Not so far.

CUT TO:

PAPPAS (V.O.)

The dolls love this baby.  It brings

them luck when they rub it -- right

between their buttons.

COREY

Angelo, we need a bigger tape.

PAPPAS

Just read the goddamn number.

COREY

Still a 46.  Maybe we can cinch it

down, wear a girdle--

PAPPAS

Screw you and this holistic fitness

crap!  At least my arms don't flap

in the wind.

BIG SHOULDERS

Okay, Pappas, let's put on the

blindfold.  Wanna see you retrieve

at least two bricks from the bottom.

PAPPAS

I've been in the field 33 years,

fired my piece 23 times in the line

of duty, and I got no idea what a

blind man fetching bricks has gotta

do with being a Special Agent!

PAPPAS

Added to which indignity, I got

three months left to retirement and

they saddle me with some blue-flamer

fresh out of Quantico for a partner.

Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas

or something.

UTAH

The shit they pull, huh?

COREY

Here he comes.  Hold up a fish,

he'll take it right outta your hand.

COREY

Hey Shamu, this is your guy.

PAPPAS

Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.

UTAH

Punk.  Quarterback Punk.

PAPPAS

(grinning)

Welcome to Sea World, kid.

VOICE

The little hand says...

REAGAN

... let's rock and roll.

REAGAN

Use a gun, go to heaven.

REAGAN

EVERYBODY FREEZE!!  That's right.

ALL TELLERS step back from the

counter!  Hands on heads!  MOVE!!

REAGAN

Everybody else on the floor!  Do it!

On the floor, let's go.

NIXON

SUCK LINOLEUM, BITCH!!  You got

earwax?!

REAGAN

Just stay cool.  Everybody stay

cool.  Heads down.  Eyes down.  The

money's insured--

REAGAN

-- it's not worth dying for.

Another 45 seconds of your time.

That's all.  Then -- Whoa, Tricky

Dick!

PAPPAS (V.O.)

Twenty-seven banks in three years.

In and out in 90 seconds.  Nobody

ever gets shot.  We're talking solid

professionals.

UTAH

Good move.

PAPPAS

Yeah, they control the room well.

Stick strictly to the cash drawers.

UTAH

They don't go for the vault?

PAPPAS

Never go for the vault.  They never

get greedy.

UTAH

Smart.  You burn time in the vault.

PAPPAS

Reagan usually drives.  Stolen

switch car, they leave it running at

the curb, looks parked from a

distance.  When they run, they dump

the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean

vanish.

UTAH

Surgical.  Look at them separate the

dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know

their jobs.

PAPPAS

The Ex-Presidents are the best I've

seen, kid.

MUNOZ

Anytime you two are finished jerking

off watching MTV I need to get a

look at that tape.

COLE

(sloppy grin)

Hey, Pappas, you tell the kid your

theory on the Presidents?

PAPPAS

Just take the tape, Cole.

MUNOZ

Hang ten, Pappas, like totally

rad...

(to Utah)

I gotta tell ya, the department

loves it.

UTAH

What's he talking about, Angelo?

HARP

They found the drop car up on

Mulholland.  I want you two to go

work it.

PAPPAS

What?  Now I'm working the drop car?

Who's handling the scene here?

HARP

Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting

them run with the ball for a while.

PAPPAS

Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case

for two years.

HARP

(zeroing in on

Pappas)

That's the point, isn't it?

PAPPAS

Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's

dick the old guys, huh, Harp?

HARP

Supervising Special Agent, Harp.

Now I want you to go work the drop

car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?

PAPPAS

Sure.  No problem.  How about your

office?  Your office need vacuuming?

We could do that too.

PAPPAS

Excuse me.

PAPPAS

Cute huh?  They love to fuck with

us.

PAPPAS

Don't tell me, let me guess.  The

switch-car was stolen this morning...

(Halsey is nodding

his head)

They vacuumed and 409'd the

interior, did the windows, emptied

the ashtrays...

HALSEY

Yeah, the usual drill.

UTAH

Could've taken their gloves off

before setting that card.  Laser it

for prints.  Maybe held it to his

teeth -- check the edges for saliva.

(a beat)

Today was a scorcher.  This Chevy

doesn't have air conditioning...

HALSEY

Sweat secretions in the seatbacks?

PAPPAS

You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me

know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under

the seat while you're at it.

(looks at his watch)

Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's

still young... you can solve this

case and start on another one.

UTAH

Well, what're your ideas on these

guys?

PAPPAS

Forget about it, kid.  They're

ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie

Mormon affirmative action assholes

handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so

I must be senile, right?  They

better get me out before I start

pissing myself in public.  Drooling.

It would look bad for the Bureau,

right?

UTAH

So you're gonna coast to retirement,

when you could nail these guys and

go out with come dignity.

PAPPAS

You watch your fucking mouth!

(pounds his chest)

Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal

of Honor right here!

UTAH

Sorry.

PAPPAS

Yeah.  That was thirty years ago

anyway.

(stares out at the

bright horizon)

L.A.'s changed a lot since then.

The air got dirty and the sex got

clean.

(after a beat)

So you want to nail the Ex-

Presidents?  Be a big hero?

UTAH

Yeah.  What's your theory?

PAPPAS

The fucking punks are surfers.

CUT TO:

PAPPAS

I'm tellin' ya, kid, it's in our

face.  Lookit the tan on this guy.

UTAH

Oh well he must be a surfer.

PAPPAS

Shutup, you might learn somethin'

you're not careful... So last year

Nixon scuffs a counter going over.

There was a soil sample.  Non-

specific mud traces of asphalt,

oils, blah, blah... sand and...

carnuba wax.  So I became a wax

expert.  There's 80 some uses for

this stuff, something like five

hundred products.

UTAH

Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax?

Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his

mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in

it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe

scuffs the counter.

PAPPAS

The lab made three possible matches,

this was one of 'em.

UTAH

(reading)

Sex wax?  You're not into kinky

shit, are you Angelo?

PAPPAS

Surfers use it on their boards.

They rub sand into it for traction.

UTAH

Thanks for the tip.  I needed this

knowledge.

PAPPAS

Now lookit the dates on the

robberies.  This is strictly a

summer job for these guys.

UTAH

... Four months.  June to October.

Mmmm...same the year before.

PAPPAS

Another month and we don't see 'em

again 'til next summer.

UTAH

They're traveling the rest of the

year on the money, going where the

waves are...

PAPPAS

(to one and all)

The Ex-Presidents rip off banks to

finance their endless summer!

UTAH

I think he needs a vacation.

CUT TO:

15

Highest performance, very kind.  If

you want to get aggro, man, this

stick can handle your best rage.

Where you surf?

UTAH

I don't.

15

Whoa!!  Back up!  This's a 5'6" tri-

fin squash-tail thruster.  You'd eat

major shit on this, dude.

15

Here, you need a rhino chaser like

this one to learn on.  Good board.

I mean for a pig board.

PAPPAS

(reading the label)

"Best for your stick", huh?  This

might not be enough.  I better get

two.

15

Hey, man, guys your age learning to

surf, it's cool, there's nothing

wrong with it.

UTAH

I'm twenty-five.

15

See that's what I'm saying, it's

never too late.

15

Hope you stay with it.  Surfin's

the source.  It'll change your life.

Swear to God.

PAPPAS

Johnny, it's the only way.

UTAH

Why can't I just walk around with

this thing under my arm and act

stoned?  Ask a few questions.

PAPPAS

Look.  Look at them out there.

PAPPAS

They're like some kind of tribe.

Got their own language.  You can't

just walk up to these guys.  You've

got to get out there.  Learn some

moves.  Get into their head.  Pick

up the speech.

UTAH

Angelo, this stuff is for little

rubber people who don't shave yet.

PAPPAS

It's all balance, right?  And

coordination.  How hard can it be?

CUT TO:

PAPPAS

I think you gotta hit them straight

on!

UTAH

(out of breath)

Got it...

LOCAL

Outta the way, you dick!

LOCAL 2

Move it, kook!

RAZORHEAD

You dinged my board, kook!!

RAZORHEAD

Politeness counts, ASSHOLE!

UTAH

Goddamn son-of-a--

PAPPAS

Kid, maybe this ain't your sport.

UTAH

Fuck it.

WOMAN SURFER

(yelling above the

roar)

Swim, goddammit!  Come on!  Move

it!

WOMAN

Look crazy son of a bitch!  You

wanna commit suicide, you do it

someplace else!

WOMAN

Look at this pig-board piece-a-shit.

It's still got the price tag on it,

for Chrissakes.  What'd you do, buy

it yesterday?  You've got no

business out here whatsoever.

UTAH

Well, I saw you and--

WOMAN

Yeah, you saw me and you figured

that if a mere girl can do it, a big

strong stud like you shouldn't have

any problem.  Right?!  Well you

figured wrong, dork!

UTAH

Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?

WOMAN

(without turning)

Carefully, tough guy.  Very

carefully.

UTAH

(yelling now)

My name's Johnny Utah!

WOMAN

Who cares!

UTAH

I'm telling you so when you look

back on this moment, you can

think... there was this guy named

Utah and he was pretty much a dork

but maybe not such a bad person and

I let him drown in conditions he had

no business being in whatsoever...

when I could have easily helped him.

UTAH

(over his shoulder,

gamely)

Bye.

WOMAN

Wait!  Jesus Christ!

(swimming back to

him)

You're fucking crazy, you know that?

You go in there you're gonna eat it

on the rocks.  Here, follow me.

WOMAN

Go when I say.  But stay down.  Just

lie on the board.  Alright, let's

go!

CUT TO:

PAPPAS

This is your surfer contact?

Female.  Blond hair.  Green eyes.

5'6".  119 lbs?

MISS DEER

Hmm, not bad, Utah.

UTAH

Tyler Ann Endicott.  Born 11-27-64.

UTAH

(reading from the

screen)

... Exhibition of speed.  Indecent

exposure inside moving vehicle...

MISS DEER

Hot, very hot.

UTAH

Felony arrest!  "See adjoining

file"...

(he types quickly)

Kidnapping?!

PAPPAS

This is great.  She ties some guy

up.  Nude.  Leaves the scene and

fails to return for 24 hours.  No

convection.

MISS DEER

Gotta avoid the rope tricks, Johnny.

UTAH

What else they got on her?  I still

haven't found anything I can really

use.  I gotta find an approach, a

way in -- here we go...

(he reads)

Both parents deceased.  Plane crash.

San Diego, '84.  Mmmm.  Yeah,

definitely.

CUT TO:

TYLER

Next!  Oh, no.

TYLER

What do you want?

UTAH

Shrimp and fries.

TYLER

I mean, what do you want?  What are

you doing hanging around here.

UTAH

(very serious)

I need you to teach me.

TYLER

Gimme a break.

(to cook)

One shrimp and fries to go!

(to Johnny)

Anything to drink?

UTAH

I'm serious.

TYLER

I can see that.  But forget it.

Stick to tennis, or whatever you're

good at.  Miniature golf.  Here,

your number's 37.

UTAH

Well, I'm just gonna go back out

there till I catch on to it or break

my neck.

TYLER

What is it?  You all of a sudden got

this bug you had to go surfing?

This is a line, right?

UTAH

No, no.  See, all my life I've done

things for other people.  In high

school I played football because my

old man expected me to.  Then my

parents always figured I'd go to law

school, so I did.  Football

scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta

Kappa--

TYLER

This gonna take long?

UTAH

Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks,

right?

(he leans forward, a

little awkward)

But two years ago they got killed in

a car wreck and I just suddenly

realized all my goals had been their

goals.  And I hadn't been living my

own life.  So I wanted something for

myself.  Something that maybe didn't

make any sense.  You know what I

mean?

UTAH

I came out here from Ohio a month

ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I

didn't think it would effect me so

much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or

something.  I want to do what you

do.  It's the truth.

TYLER

Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a

minute late I'm gone.

(he's grinning)

And Stud... I didn't take you to

raise.  I can show you a few things

but after that you're on your own.

That'll be four fifty.

UTAH

Keep the change, Teach.

CUT TO:

TYLER

Stop here.

(she turns to him)

Do you agree to do exactly what I

say when I say it?

UTAH

Sure.

CUT TO:

TYLER

Do it again.

TYLER

(to the other

surfers)

I'm not with him.

TYLER

It's closing out completely.  Let's

call it.

UTAH

Who's that?

TYLER (V.O.)

That's Bodhi.  They call his the

Bodhisattva.

TYLER

The modern savage.  Guy's even

crazier than you, Johnny Utah.

C'mon.

ROACH (O.S.)

Brah!

BODHI

Hey Tyler!

ROACH

The fuck you doin' man?!  You

fuckin' crazy?

BODHI

Chill, brah.  You know who this is?

Johnny Utah.  Ohio State, all-

conference.

(to Utah)

Rose Bowl three years ago.  Right?

ROACH

Johnny fuckin' Utah!  Fuckin'-A!

Yeah, I remember that game, man.

You were on-fire.  They could not

stop your ass.

GROMMET

Radical!  Head-butt, dude!!

GROMMET

Head-butt!!!

BODHI

Something happened.  You got nuked

in the last quarter.

UTAH

Yeah, my knee got folded about 90

degrees the wrong way.

BODHI

And that's why you never went pro?

UTAH

Two years of surgery.  I missed my

window.  Limped through law school

instead.

BODHI

Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?

(like it's a disease)

Too bad.  But at least you're

surfing now.  So your life's not

over yet, right?

UTAH

Not yet.

CUT TO:

COLE

Like totally rad stick, dude.

SEVERAL AGENTS

Gnarly, man... hang ten...

cowabunga... surf patrol... rip it

up!

HARP

How was the beach?

UTAH

Fine.

HARP

Surf conditions okay?

UTAH

A little mushy.

HARP

A little mushy!  You think the

taxpayers would like it, Utah, if

they knew they were paying a federal

agent to surf and pick up girls?

UTAH

Babes.

HARP

What?

UTAH

The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh,

this type of undercover operation is

entirely dependent on picking up the

idiom of the speech.  Otherwise

penetration is not possible, sir.

Of the social infrastructure, I

mean.

HARP

Where is Pappas?

HARP

Special Agent Utah, this is not some

job flippin' burgers at the drive-in.

Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes,

your approach to this case bothers

me.  And yes, you bother me.  You

two have produced squat in the last

two weeks, during which time the Ex-

Presidents have robbed two more

banks!!  Do you have anything even

remotely interesting to tell me?

UTAH

Caught my first tube this morning.

PAPPAS

What, you couldn't have just left

the thing in your car?

UTAH

It sticks out, so I can't lock it.

Look, Angelo, you think I joined the

FBI to learn to surf?  This was your

lame-o idea in the first place.  You

gotta back me up on this.

PAPPAS

Johnny, all I can say is we better

come up with something real soon.

MISS DEER (V.O.)

Encino Savings & Loan guard grabbed

LBJ's ponytail.  We recovered one

hair.

PAPPAS

Yeah, yeah, I remember, last year.

Guy got his jaw broken for it.

MISS DEER

One four centimeter strand.  Color

brown.  Oily.  Slight wave.

PAPPAS

Hell, what're we waiting for, let's

go pick the guy up.

UTAH

Angelo, pay attention.  There's

gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is

showing traces of toxins.  PCBs.

Heavy elements... selenium, titanium

and arsenic.

PAPPAS

Guy's the Toxic Avenger.

UTAH

The beaches are always being closed

because of waste spills, right?  And

surfers are territorial.  They stick

mostly to certain breaks.  If we can

get some hair samples, and get a

match to a certain beach, we'd know

which break the Ex-Presidents surf.

You buyin' this?

PAPPAS

No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's

gonna bug the shit out of Harp.

CUT TO:

PAPPAS

When you two are done makin' out, I

need to talk to you.

"PSYCHO-STICK" T-SHIRT

Hey, I ain't no butt-bouncer, dude.

We're from the valley.  Mall babes

'n shit.

PAPPAS

I just want to know if you surf here

a lot.

"PASSION FOR SLASHIN'" T-SHIRT

Shit yeah, like totally everyday

when it's jammin'.  What is this,

fucking narco entrapment or what,

dude?

PAPPAS

Not exactly, dudes.

UTAH

Whoa, brah, easy now... Don't move!

(Utah bends close,

reaching for Surf-

Rat's ear)

Got some huge sucker crawling into

your--

(he plucks at a tuft

of hair)

Got it!  Uuuughhh.

SURF-RAT

Leave some fuckin' hair, man!

SURF-RAT

What was it?

UTAH

Saved your butt, bro.  Close one.

CUT TO:

HALSEY

Naw, this isn't it.

PAPPAS

He moved.

HALSEY

PCBs, selenium, titanium, arsenic.

The percentages look right.  Here's

a match.

UTAH

Latigo Beach.

PAPPAS

Surf's up, ace.

CUT TO:

UTAH

Big zippo so far.  How about you?

PAPPAS (RADIO)

Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll

be subtle, if it's here at all.

WARCHILD

This the guy?

BUNKER

Yeah.

UTAH

(good natured)

Okay, so this is where you tell me

all about how locals rule and yuppie

insects like me shouldn't be surfing

your break and all that, right?

BUNKER

No.

TONE

Waste of time.

WARCHILD

We're just going to fuck you up.

UTAH

Oh.

PAPPAS

Johnny?  You there?

ARCHBOLD

The dude can fight!

BODHI

Back off!  Now!!  Just let it go!

BUNKER

Stay outta this, Bodhi!

BODHI

He's with me.  Now back off.

Seriously.Just do it!

(they relax slightly)

You alright Warchild?

WARCHILD

(holding his bleeding

nose)

Fuck you.

UTAH

What's your name?

BUNKER

Bunker.

UTAH

Well, listen, Bunker... I'm actually

kinda glad you found me.

BUNKER

Yeah?  Why?

BODHI

Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold it, ladies.  Give

it a rest.

(to Utah)

Let's go.

BODHI

(under his breath)

Do me a favor, Johnny, just keep

walking.

PAPPAS

(out of breath)

Uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10,

12, running with a car stereo?

Stole the fucking CD too, you

believe it?

UTAH

No, but there are four guys back

there you might check out.

PAPPAS

Thanks, buddy.

UTAH

Friends of yours, huh?

BODHI

The one you decked is Bunker Wiess.

The big one is his brother,

Warchild.  The other two always

hang.  They think they're some kinda

death squad around here.

UTAH

What's their program?

BODHI

They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains

are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing

because they give nothing back, and

they have no respect for the sea.

They just want to get radical.  It's

mindless aggression.  They'll never

get it, the spiritual side of it.

UTAH

You always talk like this?  You're

not gonna start chanting or anything

are you?

BODHI

(laughing)

No.

(beat)

So I was up the beach.  I saw it

going down.  you didn't hesitate...

they never backed you up an inch.

That's rare in this world.

UTAH

Thanks for stepping in.

BODHI

De nada.

UTAH

Gonna be some people at my house

tonight.  Maybe you can make it.

UTAH

Where?

BODHI

Come with Tyler.  She knows.

CUT TO:

PAPPAS

Ten seconds you're out of sight.

Unbelievable.

UTAH

You're losin' them.

(into phone)

That's right.  Two-denver-four-sam-

niner-five-niner.  Late seventies

Jeep.

PAPPAS

Look, if you're gonna go leavin'

your piece and your shield in the

car, you can damn well stay in

sight.  Okay?

UTAH

Okay, Dad.

UTAH (V.O.)

The jeep is registered to a Bradley

Wiess.  My buddy.  Guy's got quite a

sheet.

(into phone)

Yeah, yeah... skip all that.  Gimme

the greatest hits.  Misdemeanor

possession of cocaine.  That's

good...

UTAH

... Felony B and E, three months in

juvey.  Better.  Felony assault.

Postgraduate work at Chino.

Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What

about the brother?

(Utah is grinning)

Great!  Another model citizen.

These guys really fit the profile.

PAPPAS

Remember, all bank robbers are

losers, but not all losers are bank

robbers.

UTAH

These are the guys.  I can feel it.

I say we lay it on Harp.

CUT TO:

MUNOZ

This is bullshit.  This is a

bullshit lead.  This is totally

bullshit.  Harp must be fucking

desperate if he's listening to you

two flakes.

UTAH

See you bright and early, guys.

PAPPAS

Cold pizza?  It's great for

breakfast.

UTAH

When did Harp say they'd have the

warrant?

PAPPAS

He's pushing it through first thing.

You better get some sleep tonight,

it could be an interesting morning.

CUT TO:

UTAH

Nice place.

TYLER

He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi

always gets some slick place and

throws it open to every surf burnout

around.  Most a these guys can't

keep a job.  When the swell comes,

they're gone, they have to ride.

GROMMET

Do your worst, man!

UTAH

Don't you gamble?

BODHI

Only make bets I can't afford to

lose.  Only way to be 100%

committed.

UTAH

Who's the girl?

TYLER

Catch of the day.

UTAH

Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.

TYLER

People are expendable to Bodhi.

UTAH

Meaning you were expendable.

TYLER

(shrugs)

We went out for about five

minutes... which is four minutes

longer than most of them.  But you

can't hold it against him, he's...

different.

UTAH

Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".

TYLER

(she chuckles)

Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a

higher plane of existence, or

something.

(thoughtful)

Maybe he has.  You've seen him

surf... that frenzy.  It seems like

anger.  It's not.  It's the energy

of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman

in his life.  She's his only true

lover.

UTAH

All she does is beat the shit out of

me.

DISSOLVE TO:

NATHANIEL

(beer soaked speech)

... Okay, so you're in the face,

it's twenty-five feet straight down,

your balls are about this big.

(like he's holding up

two BB's)

And the whole thing's moving, right,

roaring like you're stuck to the

front of a freight train.  There

ain't nothin' like it, man.  The

ultimate rush.  Forget about sex, it

doesn't even come close.

ROACH

You lose it right then, you're

history.  The fish'll be pickin' you

outta the coral.

NATHANIEL

(matter of factly)

Thanks, brah.

ROACH

See, it's all dynamic, it's all in

motion.  You can't just stop and

walk on in to the beach if you don't

like the way things are going, y'

know what I mean?  You gotta ride it

out man, all the way.

GROMMET

You ride the monsters, you gotta

know you're ridin' a line between

life and death.  There ain't no

forgiveness.

UTAH

So what's the biggest?  Waimea?

BODHI (V.O.)

No, Bells Beach, Australia.

GROMMET

Shit, yeah!  I remember that day...

gnarly fuckin' ass!  Was your

birthday--

ROACH

The set was northwest.  Jacking up

like a fucking mountain of gray

glass--

BODHI

I made that one mistake you pray

you'll never make--

NATHANIEL

You shoulda fuckin' seen it... it

was like he fell for-ever.  Then the

curl crashes down and he's gooone--

GROMMET

-- held down in the washing machine,

man... it was severe, we couldn't

see nothin' thought it was all over

for sure--

BODHI

Not tragic to die doing what you

love.  You want the ultimate thrill,

you gotta be willing to pay the

ultimate price.

NATHANIEL

Fuckin' A.

GROMMET

(draining a Corona)

Hell, I ain't gonna see 30.

UTAH

(to the surfers,

covering)

Uh.  I need another beer.

TYLER

Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies.

I hope you're not buying into this

banzai-bullshit like the rest of

Bodhi's moonies.

UTAH

What are you talking about?

TYLER

I've seen that kamikaze look,

Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi

can smell it a mile away.  He'll

take you to the edge... and past it.

(she looks past

Johnny, sees

something)

Hey, Bodhi.

BODHI

Johnny has his own demons, don't

you, Johnny?

BODHI

Feel it?

BODHI

Gentlemen, it's time.

UTAH

What's goin' on?

TYLER

Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always

knows.

BODHI

Let's go, Utah.  Time for a little

stealth mission.

CUT TO:

ROACH

(a voice in the

distance)

Gaping barrels!  Way overhead, man!

UTAH

I can barely do this in broad

daylight.

TYLER

Come on.  At least no one's gonna

see how bad you are.

UTAH

I gotta be fucking crazy.

BODHI

Yeah, but are you crazy enough?

BODHI

Football's a man-made game.  You

keep score with numbers.  But in

this, there's no field, no rules, no

opponent.  Just you and the wave.

UTAH

I know that part.  Tell me something

I can use, here.

BODHI

I've watched you once or twice.  You

surf like it's some kind of street

fight.  You jerk along from moment

to moment, fighting everything that

comes at you.  Always trying to win.

UTAH

A flaw I'm working on.

BODHI

The only way to win out here is to

surrender.  You have to feel what

the wave is doing, accept its

energy, get in sync.  Just feel it

all moving in the blackness... you

don't need to see.

UTAH

Yeah, right, vision is highly over-

rated.

BODHI

This one's got your name on it,

Johnny.

BODHI

Let's go.

UTAH

Shit, I'm gonna die.  I'm gonna die

now.

TYLER

You had enough?

UTAH

Yeah.  I just want to sit out here

for a minute.

TYLER

Look at you.

UTAH

What?

TYLER

Well, usually you have this sort of

intense scowl of concentration, like

you're doing this for a school

project or something... I don't

know, like something's driving you.

(she puts her

fingertip to  his

forehead)

See, it's gone.  If I didn't know

better I'd say you looked almost

happy.

UTAH

I... I don't know.  I can't describe

what I'm feeling.

TYLER

(smiling)

You don't have to.

UTAH

Goosebumps.  Come here.

TYLER

Those are cold.

UTAH

Warm them up.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

UTAH

Holy shit.

CUT TO:

UTAH

(whispering)

You guys need any help?

COLE

(not amused)

You're late.

PAPPAS (V.O.)

Did that worthless punk partner of

mine ever show up?

UTAH

(grinning)

Right here, partner.

PAPPAS

Good of you to join us, hotshot.

(to Babbit)

Watch it.  I told you, not on the

hairs, goddammit.

UTAH

I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where

you want me?

PAPPAS

Cole and Munoz are going in the back

door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I

want you at the side window by the

hedge.  You're strictly backup, got

it?

UTAH

Got it.

PAPPAS

Awright.  Get into position.  I'm

rolling.

PAPPAS

Here Scooby!  Where are you boy?

Here Scooby!!  You furball piece of

shit.

FIBERGLASS

Yeah?  What?

PAPPAS

Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of

a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About

this big.

FIBERGLASS

No.

UTAH

(into his headset)

Babbit.  Get Angelo out of there.

They're pulling out a fucking

arsenal!  Babbit, you copy?  Cole?

Don't let him pull his badge!

MUNOZ

Utah, say again.  What?

(to Cole)

I can't hear jack shit over this

lawnmower.  Christ.

PAPPAS (V.O.)

... and the guy next door said he

saw it go into your backyard.  My

wife'll kill me if I lose the little

bastard.  Me, I could care less.

Whole house smells from it's liftin'

its leg all the time...

BUNKER

Something's goin' down, man.  This

ain't right.

TONE

(freaked)

No, man, it's nothin'.  It's

nothin'.

BUNKER

Will you shut the fuck up!  Check

the windows.  Do it!!

PAPPAS

You sure he isn't out back?  You

mind if I go take a look?

FIBERGLASS

Look, I don't know anything about

your dog, okay--

PAPPAS

Well is there anyone else here that

might have seen him?

FIBERGLASS

There's nobody else here...

WARCHILD

There's two guys by the back door.

Ducked down.

TONE

Oh, shit.  Shit!!  We're fucked,

man.

BUNKER

That fat fuck comes through the door

I'm gonna pump him up.  Swear to

Christ, man, I'm gonna blow the dude

up!

PAPPAS

FBI, gorgeous.  Now let's take a

look around--

UTAH

FBI!!  DROP IT!

WARCHILD

Move it, man.  Let's get the fuck

out of here!

PAPPAS

Speak into the microphone.

PAPPAS

It's always been lasers and paper

targets until today, right?

PAPPAS

No difference, Utah.  Just a little

more to clean up.

(squeezes the

rookie's  shoulder)

It's alright.  You did good today.

PAPPAS

Oh shit.

CUT TO:

DIETZ

You know what this is?!  Two keys

uncut crystal meth!

UTAH

What the hell's your problem?

DIETZ

You think I like this haircut?  My

wife wants me to stay at Ramada -- I

been working on these guys for THREE

MONTHS!  Finally -- finally--

(nodding to Warchild)

-- I get dickwad in there wantin' to

play wheel of fortune so I can find

out their supplier!

HARP

This is agent Dietz, DEA.  He's got

a record of your suspect's movements

every day for the last three months.

DIETZ

(stabbing the air

with the packets)

All I wanna know is how are these

guys supposed to be holding up

Tarzana City National on August 2nd,

when they are in Fort-fucking-

Lauderdale August 2ND!!!

HARP

Not an easy thing to do, is it,

Utah?

UTAH

Aw shit.

PAPPAS

Nice tattoo, Dietz.

CUT TO:

BODHI

C'mon brah, there's a righteous

swell.  Let's go!  Let's go!

TYLER

He does this.

CUT TO:

TYLER

Come on, Utah.  Everybody's out

there catchin' all the good rides.

TYLER

What's wrong Johnny?

(goes back to him)

You're like a different person.

UTAH

I am a different person, Tyler.

TYLER

Hey.  You okay?  You look like you

saw a ghost.

PAPPAS

Forget about it, kid, They're

ghosts...

UTAH

I... I gotta go.

TYLER

Johnny... what's going on?  I don't

get it... did I do something?

UTAH

No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go.

I'll, uh... I'll call you later.

I'm sorry.

DISSOLVE TO:

PAPPAS

Hey, babe.  Get on over here so the

big dog can teach ya how to bark.

UTAH

Woof, woof.

PAPPAS

Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call

first, you know?  Hey, where the

hell were you all day?  You gotta at

least call in or something.  You

okay?

UTAH

Angelo, we gotta talk.

PAPPAS

Listen, uh... if you're okay, can it

wait till tomorrow morning, kid,

I...

MISS DEER

Angie, they didn't have the kind of

wine you like but I got... oh, hi

Johnny!

CUT TO:

UTAH

... so I started tailing him.

PAPPAS

This Zen master surfer.

UTAH

Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day,

right.  He goes here, he goes there,

he goes to Tower Records and buys

come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's

Road House...

(mock casual)

... he goes into the Assured Trust

Savings and Loan.

PAPPAS

Did he rob it?

UTAH

Cute.  He was inside for about 20

minutes.  The other guy, Roach,

waited in the truck.  They were

scoping it out, right?!

UTAH

Yeah, or cashing a check.

UTAH

Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back

to their beach house and box up all

their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's

truck and take it to a public

storage unit.  You see?  Summer's

almost over.  They're splitting.

They're gonna pick up a little

traveling money tomorrow.  The next

day at the outside latest.  I got a

feeling.

PAPPAS

Last time you got a feeling I had to

kill a man, which I always hate

because it looks bad on the report.

UTAH

Angelo... I'm right this time.  We

can still win this one.

PAPPAS

Alright, look... banks are closed.

Nothing's gonna go down tonight,

right?  So we'll be on these guys

like white on rice... first thing

tomorrow morning.  Okay?  Tomorrow.

Okay?

UTAH

Woof, woof.

CUT TO:

UTAH (V.O.)

They're gone.  Son of a bitch.  We

missed them.

PAPPAS

They're on their way to Maui.

UTAH

No way.  Not yet.  Come on.

PAPPAS

Jesus Christ, kid!  The banks don't

open 'till nine.

UTAH

I say we call it in.  Get some

backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp

won't listen to me.

PAPPAS

Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call

up and tell him his favorite agent

saw this one surfer moon another

surfer yesterday and it looked real

suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably

call out the National Guard.

UTAH

I say we don't call it in.  Under no

circumstance are we to call this in.

PAPPAS

Look, we handle it ourselves, for

right now, okay?  We cover the bank,

whatever.  You and me.  That way if

nothing happens, or more accurately,

when nothing happens... I don't get

my tits any further into the wringer

than they already are.

CUT TO:

PAPPAS

Time for lunch.

UTAH

Angelo, it's eleven thirty.

PAPPAS

That place up the street has

meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.

CUT TO:

VOICE FROM INSIDE

Two meatball, one tuna on wheat,

two lemonades.  Total's seven eighty

four.

UTAH

Here, yours is the one that looks

like a road kill.  Enjoy.

UTAH

Here's your lemonade.

(he looks down the

street)

Did you see that T-Bird pull up?

PAPPAS

(without looking)

Damn, I could eat the ass out of an

elephant.  I shoulda had you get me

three a these.  What T-Bird?

PAPPAS

Jesus Christ!!  It's them!

UTAH

FBI!!  Freeze!!  Right now!

PAPPAS

Come on, kid, get in the car!

Jesus!

UTAH

The hell are they?!

PAPPAS

They took a left at the next light!

UTAH

You sure?!

UTAH

I got 'em.  I see 'em.  I'm on it,

I'm on it.

PAPPAS

You even watching the road?

LBJ

Where are they, man?  I don't see

'em.  We lose 'em?

PAPPAS

Nice fuckin' work, hotshot.

Christ!

REAGAN

Emergency sanitization!  Here we go!

NIXON

Let's go!  Move it, Ronny!

WOMAN

Get the fuck out of this house!

What the fuck do you think you're

doing--

UTAH

Not now.  Not now!

REAGAN

You want me, there's only one way.

CUT TO:

PAPPAS

Nothing?

UTAH

Nothing.

PAPPAS

Go home, kid.  Get the hell outta

here.  Get some sleep.  You look

like shit.  They get anything even

resembles your guy, I'm on your

beeper.  Here.  You like feta?

UTAH

Feta.  My favorite.

PAPPAS

Johnny...

PAPPAS

All I wanna know is one thing, why

didn't you just take the shot?

UTAH

I don't know.

CUT TO:

UTAH

Ouch.

TYLER

Betadyne doesn't hurt.

UTAH

You're kneeling on my hand.

TYLER

So what'd the other guy look like?

UTAH

Never saw him, was your basic hit

and run.

TYLER

But you look like you been in a

train wreck, how'd he just drive

away?

TYLER

Johnny, what is it with you?  You

have that look again, it's like

you're about to tell me something

and then you don't... or you can't.

What's going on?

TYLER

What?  What do you want to tell me?

UTAH

I'm glad you pulled me out of the

water that day...

DISSOLVE TO:

TYLER

A lawyer!?  You lied to me!

TYLER

Look, Tyler, I can--

TYLER

Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been

using me!  Your jacket's on the

floor in the bathroom -- this

goddamn thing's half out of the

pocket... Oh God, it's all part of

some case, isn't it?

UTAH

Tyler, put the gun down.

TYLER

You tell me the fucking truth

Johnny... did your parents really

die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!

UTAH

No.  They live in Columbus Ohio.

UTAH

I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after

are surfers.  I needed you, at

first, but not--

TYLER

Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!!

Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you

to hell!

UTAH

Tyler!  Wait!!

CUT TO:

TYLER (V.O.)

Hi, it's me.  Leave a message.

UTAH

Tyler I... look, I fucked up, okay.

I know I fucked up.  I wanted to

tell you, but I couldn't -- I was

afraid you'd leave... good guess,

huh?

(grimacing)

Fuck, why can't I ever say what I

really mean?  I lied to you.  I'm an

asshole... but I need you, Tyler.  I

want you to know that I've never

known anyone like you before in my

life... and I... I hope you change

your mind...

DISSOLVE TO:

UTAH

Tyler!  Wait, I--

BODHI

Howdy brah.

BODHI

C'mon, get your gear on, we're

rollin'.

UTAH

What going on, Bodhi?

BODHI

Here.

(spying Johnny's cut

face)

Hey, what happened?  Ya cut

yourself shaving?

UTAH

I don't think I wanna surf right

now.

BODHI

Naw, this is different, Johnny.

This is something totally

different... you're gonna love this.

BODHI

C'mon, let's go, let's go.  Time's

wastin', brah.

CUT TO:

BODHI

Life's sure got a sick sense of

humor, don't you think so Johnny?

UTAH

How you figure?

BODHI

(slight laugh)

News, last night... those guys, the

Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank

yesterday.  And I was just there the

day before, cashing a check.  See...

look.  Assured Trust... same place.

BODHI

I was picking up some bucks cause

we're leaving town.  Bizarre, huh?

If I'd waited a day I'd been right

in the middle of it.  Kinda sorry I

missed it.  I'd liked to've seen

them.

UTAH

Takes guts to rob a bank.  All that

adrenalin pumping, waving loaded

guns, taking out the guards, getting

everybody on the floor, never

knowin' who's gonna burst in...

(looks right at

Bodhi)

... wondering what it's like to take

a bullet.  Must be some ride.

BODHI

Banks are insured, brah.  Long as

nobody gets shot, it's really a

victimless crime.  Just gotta scare

'em a little, would be my guess.

(ponders something)

Now if I was gonna rob a bank, with

all those guys wearin' body armor

these days, know what I'd carry?

BODHI

.454 Casull.  Most powerful handgun

on the planet.  Muzzle velocity of

2000 feet per second.  Twice the

kinetic energy of a .44 Magnum.

UTAH

One shot stopping.

BODHI

(laughs)

'One shot stopping'... good, very

good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like

you because you'll sacrifice

anything to win.  I respect that.

It elevates you a little above the

drones who have learned compromise.

Here, hold it.  Check out the

weight.

BODHI

(cheerfully)

Whoa.  Careful.  You got the muzzle

pointing right at me, brah.

UTAH

Nice.

BODHI

It's a special day, Johnny U.  A

very special day...

CUT TO:

BODHI

Ever done this before?

UTAH

Once.

BODHI

Pure adrenalin, right?!  The

ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for

it, jab a vein for it -- all you

gotta do is jump.

UTAH

Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I

sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--

BODHI

Yeah, I noticed you limping.

(grins)

But don't worry about it, brah.

Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna

land on land!

UTAH

Oh, well, that's fine then.  I feel

so much better.

CUT TO:

BODHI

It's a little ceremony we always

have at the end of summer.  One last

speedstar.

UTAH

So, who... uh, who packed my chute?

BODHI

I did.  What's the matter?  Don't

trust me?

UTAH

You gotta earn trust.

BODHI

Then we'll earn it together.  Here,

take mine.

ROACH

Hey... you don't want Bodhi's, man.

His pack-jobs suck... they only open

half the time.  Take Grommet's, man.

GROMMET

Whoa, unfair, dude!

UTAH

We gonna jump or jerk off?

BODHI

My man!

BODHI (RADIO)

Utah, you copy bruddah?

UTAH (RADIO)

Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!

BODHI

I'll take that as a yes.

ROACH

Whip it out dudes!  Cheap sex with

the cosmos!

BODHI

Ten thousand feet.  Let's do it.

BODHI

Come on Johnny.  Get in here!

BODHI

Relax, brah.  I got you, I got you.

GROMMET

Righteous-ass speedstar, dudes!

BODHI

You diggin' this?

UTAH

Great!  GREAT!

BODHI

Purty-thirty and we're meat waffles,

folks.  See ya downtown!

BODHI

You gonna pull?

UTAH

After you, Alfonse.  I insist!

BODHI

Don't screw around man, pull it!

UTAH

You do it... you first!

BODHI

One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn

cord!

UTAH

You first!

BODHI

Okay!

UTAH

Jesus Christ.  I gotta be losin' it.

CUT TO:

BODHI

Ya see... I told you Johnny U was

gonna be just fine!

BODHI

C'mere.  There's something you need

to see.

UTAH

What's this?

BODHI

Insurance policy.  Now this is going

to sting a bit, but it's for your

own growth, brah.  Press play.

BODHI

She's a wild one, isn't she...

Special Agent Utah?

UTAH

You're a fucking dead man--

BODHI

(gasping for breath)

Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm

the only one knows where they are.

Just let me talk for a second.

UTAH

Talk.

BODHI

She'll be fine, Rosie won't do

anything.  At least not as long as I

meet him at a certain place and time,

about... let's see...

(he looks at his

dive Rolex)

... six hours from now.

UTAH

You call him... right now... and

tell him to let her go.

BODHI

Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on

the road.  And where they're going

there's no phones.  Damn, I hate

this Johnny, I really do.  I hate

violence.  See, that's why I need

Rosie.  I could never make this

thing work, myself.  No way I could

hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man!

She was my woman, once.  We shared

time in this world.  But Rosie, he's

kind of a... mechanism.  Once you

set him in motion, he won't stop.

That's his gift, a kind of...

blankness.  Noon comes, straight up,

he'll gut her like a pig and try not

to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I

can do, unless I get there.

BODHI

So that makes us partners, doesn't

it?  Because now we both have the

same goal... to get me where I need

to go.  Right?

UTAH

We're wasting time.

BODHI

See!  That's what I like about you,

man!  You're just sharp as a razor

blade.

BODHI

Get the plane down to Santa Monica

and top up the tanks.

(to the others)

Let's go.  Let's saddle up!

CUT TO:

BODHI (V.O.)

Okay.  All I'm askin' for is ninety

seconds of your life, Johnny.

That's all.

BODHI

It's basic dog psychology, brah.  If

you scare them, get them pissing

down their leg, they submit... you

control them.  If you project

weakness, you draw aggression...

that's how people get hurt.

BODHI

Fear causes hesitation, and

hesitation will cause your worst

fears to come true.  You project

strength to avoid conflict.

ROACH

Peace through superior firepower,

babe.

BODHI

Here, you need this.  You can't be

comin' through that door with your

dick in your hands, right?

UTAH

I can't do this.

BODHI

Sure you can!  You may even like

it... it's a killer rush.  You'll

see.  Hey, don't I show you things,

Johnny U?

UTAH

Bodhi, this is your wake up call,

man -- I... am... an... Eff...

Bee... Eye... Agent!!

BODHI

Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a

higher plane, you and I.  We make

our own rules.  Why be a servant of

the law Johnny U... when you can be

it's master?

GROMMET

Fuckin' A!

BODHI

Ninety seconds, man, door to door.

A small price to pay for someone who

loves you.

(he looks up)

She does you know.  It's not her

style to fall so hard... I don't

think she did with me.

BODHI

Sorry, Johnny.  Guess you don't get

to be president.

BODHI

Rock and roll!

BODHI

Everybody freeze!!  Don't move!!

GROMMET

Don't fucking do it, man!

BODHI/REAGAN

All Tellers back away from the

counter!  Hands on your heads!

RIGHT NOW!!  That's right.  You know

the drill.

BODHI/REAGAN

All customers on the floor.  Let's

go!  Move it!  Get down!  On the

floor!  Right now!  Let's go.

UTAH

On the floor, asshole!  What's your

problem?!  I blow your fucking

kneecaps out, you'll be on the

floor!!

BODHI/REAGAN

Kick in the ass, ain't it?  Gonna be

kinda hard to explain though... when

they play the tapes back down at the

bureau.  Could look bad on your

monthly evaluation.

UTAH

Can we just get the goddamn money

and get out of here?!

BODHI/REAGAN

That's the spirit!!

(to the room)

Head's down!  Eyes down!  Just a

couple minutes of your life and

we're gone.

BODHI/REAGAN

You!

(reading a name-tag)

Miss Jennings... of New Accounts.

Be a dear and open the inner gate

for my associate.  NOW!!

MISS JENNINGS

He -- he -- he has the keys.  Mr.

Duggan.

BODHI/REAGAN

Whatta say, Mr. Duggan?  Wanna give

her the keys or do I pick through

the blood and chunks for them?

DUGGAN

Do whatever they say, Terry.

UTAH

You're blowing it, man!  You're

breaking your own rules... pulling

too much time!

BODHI/REAGAN

JFK, how we doin'?

NATHANIEL/JFK

All clear, man!

UTAH

Federal agent!  Undercover!

BODHI

Don't anybody fucking move!

GROMMET

Oh no, oh my god, oh god... it's all

comin' out man, gotta stop it...

it's all gonna come out... do

something!!

ROACH

(freaking to Bodhi)

We gotta bug out, man!  We're eatin'

it bad on this one.  Let's go!

BODHI

Goodbye, Johnny.

CUT TO:

MUNOZ

-- if you so desire, an attorney

will be provided for you free of

cost.  Do you understand these

rights I have explained to you?

Utah?

PAPPAS

He knows his goddamn rights!

(looks at Utah)

Jesus, kid.  I knew you were getting

too close to these guys.

(turns to the other

agents)

Gimme the goddamn key to these

things, Cole.  Christ!

HARP

Don't take those off.  Just leave

them on!  Your partner's an

accessory to murder.  You realize

that?

HARP

Three men dead.  One of them a cop.

How's that sit in your gut, Utah?

UTAH

(cold and scary)

Take your hand off my shoulder right

now.

PAPPAS

Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to

the uniforms like some punk.  Let me

ride him in.

HARP

Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two

screw-ups deserve each other.

That's why I put you together in the

first place.  Christ Pappas, you're

as bad as he is... talk about the

blind leading the blind--

PAPPAS

Harp, let me tell you something.  I

was an agent in this bureau when

your mommy was still wiping your

shinny pink ass, and you know one

thing I learned in all those years

that you still haven't?

HARP

What that?

PAPPAS

Respect your elders.

(he takes Utah by

the arm)

Let's go kid.

CUT TO:

UTAH

I know where they're going.

PAPPAS

Figured you did.

UTAH

Only problem is... we can't arrest

them or shoot them.

CUT TO:

UTAH

I'm not armed.

BODHI

But you're not alone.

UTAH

Good guess.  There's a gun on you

right now.

UTAH

Where's Roach?

BODHI

Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in

kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can

I do for you?

UTAH

You gotta tell me where she is.

BODHI

And let my policy expire?  Sorry.

UTAH

Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead.

The ride is over.

BODHI

I say when it's over!

UTAH

The guy you killed was an off duty

cop!  If you get out of here they'll

nail you wherever you land.  They

have a new thing called radar.

Maybe you've heard of it.

UTAH

I know you man, when they fall on

you, you won't back down.  They'll

have to burn your ass to the ground.

And I can't stop them... I'm the

last person they're ready to listen

to right now.  Thanks to you.

UTAH

Shit may or may not happen.

UTAH

Look, you got a death wish, you want

to ride to glory... fine!  But don't

take her with you, man.  I'm begging

you... tell me where she is.  Then I

walk away.  We've earned that much

trust, haven't we?

BODHI

(to the pilot)

Back in the hotseat, campadre.

NOW!

UTAH

Angelo!  Don't fire!

PAPPAS

Kid, get outta the way!!

UTAH

NOOO!!

PAPPAS

GODDAMMIT!!

UTAH

NNNOOOOOO!!!

PILOT

I ain't flyin' you guys to San

Phillipe man, forget it.  Not now--

BODHI

Thanks for telling the nice FBI

agent where we're going.

ROACH

Get in the fucking plane.

BODHI

We're gonna ride this out, all the

way, Johnny.  You and me.  Let's go.

CUT TO:

PILOT

Look, we been in Mexico the last

half hour... can I quit mowing the

lawn here or what?  I'm getting more

brush in the wheels than I usually

like, you know what I'm saying?!

BODHI

Yeah, get some height.  Take her up

to eight thousand on this heading.

ROACH

We're gonna pop up on their screens.

BODHI

Doesn't matter now.  We're almost

there, man.  Here, let me help you

get your gear on.

ROACH

I'm cold.

BODHI

You're gonna be fine.  Just fine.

Johnny, toss me that money bag will

you.  Easy does it.

UTAH

You're cold because all the blood is

running out of your body, Roach.

You're going to be dead soon.

(he tosses the bag)

I hope it was worth it.

BODHI

Hey, Johnny's just trying to psych

you man, forget it.  Just keep

thinking about all those senoritas

nursin' you back to health.  Come

on, amigo, let's get you set for the

jump.

BODHI

Rosie, Rosie, this is Air Force One,

do you copy, over?

ROSIE (V.O.)

Copy you, Air Force One.  We have a

visual on you.  Lookin' fine.

UTAH

Tell him to release Tyler.

BODHI

Why should I?

UTAH

What if your chute fails, Bodhi?

Rescind the order.  Let her off the

hook, she's served her purpose.  Do

it, man, you owe me that much.  Let

me hear it before you check out.

BODHI

Rosie, listen carefully.  Surgery

is canceled, is that clear?  Repeat

it back to me.

ROSIE (V.O.)

Copy you.  Surgery is canceled.

I'm lettin' the bitch go.

BODHI

I know it's hard for you Johnny.

You want me so bad it's like acid in

your mouth.  But not his time.

(he braces Roach at

the door)

Let's go.

BODHI

You lose, campadre.

UTAH

FUCK IT!!!

UTAH

Pull the parachute!!

BODHI

Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for

you.  Why don't you pull it?

UTAH

No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord!

Now!!

BODHI

Naw, you pull it!

BODHI

Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you

gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?!

You use your other hand what you

gonna hold on with?

UTAH

Pull it right now or I'll blow your

fucking head off and pull it myself!

BODHI

Well that's the only way it's gonna

happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you

want to do it.  You're gonna die,

Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...

UTAH

You fucking crazy!?  Pull it!!

BODHI

Three seconds... two... one...

UTAH

SHIT!!

BODHI

Wild ride, huh?

UTAH

(gasping)

Jesus Christ, Bodhi!

BODHI

That pesky knee, huh?  Too bad.

BODHI

You had me worried there, for a

second, Johnny U.

DISSOLVE TO:

BARTENDER

Gonna close early today, mate, 'fore

the bloody storm hits.

UTAH

Storm's already here... It's

bringing me the swell.

TYLER

John, they're here.

CUT TO:

LIEUTENANT

D'you see him, Mr. Utah?

UTAH

No.  But he's here.

LIEUTENANT

Now, look, I know you used to be a

federal agent up in the states and

all that, but you're a citizen now,

so just find him and we'll handle it

from there.

UTAH

No problem.  Just give me a couple

minutes with him first.

CUT TO:

1ST SURFER

Jesus Almighty, the bloody sand's

shakin'.

2ND SURFER

Totally closed-out.  It's fuckin'

death on a stick.

UTAH (V.O.)

I knew you wouldn't miss the fifty

year storm, Bodhi.

BODHI

And I always knew I could count on

you, Agent Utah.

UTAH

I'm not FBI anymore.

BODHI

You never were...

UTAH

I asked them to give me a couple

minutes...

BODHI

It went bad, brah.  Real bad.

(smiles inwardly)

I just felt it was time...

BODHI

Time to dance with the universe.

(he turns to Utah)

I could never handle a jail cell.

You'll do this for me, won't you

Johnny?  Haven't I earned this

much?

BODHI

Thanks, brah.

UTAH

He rode it all the way.
