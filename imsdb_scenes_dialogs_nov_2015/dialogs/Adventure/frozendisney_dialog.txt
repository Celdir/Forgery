Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

YOUNG ELSA

(grumbling)

Anna, go back to sleep.

FROZEN - J. Lee

YOUNG ANNA

(drama queen-ish)

I just can't. The sky's awake, so

I'm awake, so we have to play.

YOUNG ELSA

...Go play by yourself.

YOUNG ANNA

(mischievously)

Do you want to build a snowman?

YOUNG ANNA

Come on, come on, come on, come on.

YOUNG ANNA

Do the magic! Do the magic!

YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

This is amazing!

YOUNG ELSA

Watch this!

FROZEN - J. Lee

YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)

(goofy voice)

Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

YOUNG ANNA

I love you, Olaf.

YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

Catch me!

YOUNG ELSA

Gotcha!

YOUNG ANNA

FROZEN - J. Lee

KING

Elsa, what have you done? This is

getting out of hand!

QUEEN

(seeing Anna)

Anna!

ELSA

It was an accident. I'm sorry,

Anna.

QUEEN

(about Anna)

She's ice cold.

KING

...I know where we have to go.

SLAM CUT TO:

KRISTOFF

Ice?

SLAM CUT TO:

FROZEN - J. Lee

YOUNG KRISTOFF

Faster, Sven!

KING

Please, help. My daughter!

YOUNG KRISTOFF

Trolls...?

BULDA

Shush. I'm trying to listen.

BULDA (CONT'D)

Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

GRAND PABBIE

Your Majesty.

(referring to Elsa)

Born with the powers or cursed?

KING

Born. And they're getting stronger.

7

FROZEN - J. Lee

GRAND PABBIE

(about Anna)

You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

The heart is not so easily changed,

but the head can be persuaded.

KING

Do what you must.

GRAND PABBIE

I recommend we remove all magic,

even memories of magic to be

safe.... But don't worry, I'll

leave the fun.

GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)

She will be okay.

YOUNG ELSA

But she won't remember I have

powers?

KING

It's for the best.

PABBIE

Listen to me, Elsa, your power will

only grow.

PABBIE (CONT'D)

There is beauty in your magic....

But also great danger.

PABBIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

You must learn to control it.

PABBIE (CONT'D)

Fear will be your enemy.

8

FROZEN - J. Lee

KING

No. We'll protect her. She can

learn to control it. I'm sure.

DISSOLVE TO:

KING (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Until then, we'll lock the gates.

We'll reduce the staff. We will

limit her contact with people and

keep her powers hidden from

everyone... including Anna.

DISSOLVE TO:

"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"

YOUNG ANNA

DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

COME ON LET'S GO AND PLAY.

YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

I NEVER SEE YOU ANYMORE.

COME OUT THE DOOR.

IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GONE AWAY.

9

FROZEN - J. Lee

YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

WE USED TO BE BEST BUDDIES

AND NOW WE'RE NOT.

I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHY.

YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SNOWMAN.

YOUNG ELSA (O.S.)

Go away, Anna.

YOUNG ANNA

(hearbroken)

...OKAY BYE.

KING

The gloves will help.

KING (CONT'D)

See? You're good....

(starting their mantra)

Conceal it.

YOUNG ELSA

Don't feel it.

YOUNG ELSA & KING

Don't let it show.

ANNA (9)

DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

10

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

OR RIDE OUR BIKE AROUND THE HALL?

I THINK SOME COMPANY IS OVERDUE...

ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

I'VE STARTED TALKING TO

THE PICTURES ON THE WALLS.

ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

Hang in there, Joan.

ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY

ALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS.

ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

JUST WATCHING THE HOURS TICK BY.

ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK.

ELSA (12)

I'm scared. It's getting stronger.

KING

Getting upset only makes it worse.

ELSA (12)

No. Don't touch me. I don't want to

hurt you.

11

FROZEN - J. Lee

TEEN ANNA

See you in two weeks.

TEEN ELSA

Do you have to go?

KING

You'll be fine, Elsa.

ANNA

(singing)

Elsa? PLEASE I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE

PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHERE YOU'VE BEEN

THEY SAY HAVE COURAGE

AND I'M TRYING TO

I'M RIGHT OUT HERE FOR YOU.

PLEASE LET ME IN.

ANNA (CONT'D)

WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.

IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

(weak, internal)

DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

FADE OUT.

12

FROZEN - J. Lee

DOCK MASTER

Welcome to Arendelle!

BOY

Why do I have to wear this?

MOTHER

Because the Queen has come of age.

It's Coronation Day!

BOY

That's not my fault.

KRISTOFF

What do you want, Sven?

KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)

Give me a snack.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

What's the magic word?

KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)

Please!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Hey, hey, hey! Share!

13

FROZEN - J. Lee

PERSI

I can't believe they're finally

opening up the gates!

AGGIE

And for a whole day! Faster, Persi!

DUKE

Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious

trade partner. Open those gates so

I may unlock your secrets and

exploit your riches.

(catching himself)

...Did I just say that out loud?

IRISHMAN

Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see

the Queen and the Princess. I bet

they're absolutely lovely.

SPANISH DIGNITARY

I bet they are beautiful.

CUT TO:

KAI (O.S.)

Princess Anna...?

ANNA

...Huh? Yeah?

KAI (O.S.)

Sorry to wake you, ma'am but--

ANNA

No, you didn't. I've been up for

hours.

14

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA (CONT'D)

Who is it?

KAI (O.S.)

It's still me, ma'am. Time to get

ready.

ANNA

Ready for what?

KAI (O.S.)

Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

ANNA

My sister's cor-neration...

ANNA (CONT'D)

Coronation Day! Ha ha!

SLAM CUT TO:

"For the First Time in Forever"

ANNA

THE WINDOW IS OPEN!

SO'S THAT DOOR!

I DIDN'T KNOW THEY DID THAT ANYMORE.

WHO KNEW WE OWNED 8000 SALAD PLATES...?

ANNA (CONT'D)

FOR YEARS I HAVE ROAMED THESE EMPTY HALLS

WHY HAVE A BALLROOM WITH NO BALLS?

FINALLY, THEY'RE OPENING UP THE GATES!

15

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA (CONT'D)

THERE'LL BE REAL, ACTUAL PEOPLE -

IT'LL BE TOTALLY STRANGE.

BUT WOW AM I SO READY FOR THIS CHANGE!

ANNA (CONT'D)

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

THERE'LL BE MUSIC, THERE'LL BE LIGHT.

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

I'LL BE DANCING THROUGH THE NIGHT.

ANNA (CONT'D)

DON'T KNOW IF I'M ELATED OR GASSY,

BUT I'M SOMEWHERE IN THAT ZONE

'CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

I WON'T BE ALONE.

(speaking)

I can't wait to meet everyone....

(GASP) What if I meet THE ONE?

ANNA (CONT'D)

TONIGHT, IMAGINE ME GOWN AND ALL-

FETCHINGLY DRAPED AGAINST THE WALL.

THE PICTURE OF SOPHISTICATED GRACE.

ANNA (CONT'D)

(google-eyed)

I SUDDENLY SEE HIM STANDING THERE,

A BEAUTIFUL STRANGER TALL AND FAIR.

(mouth full of chocolate)

I WANNA STUFF SOME CHOCOLATE IN MY

FACE!

ANNA (CONT'D)

BUT THEN WE LAUGH AND TALK ALL EVENING,

WHICH IS TOTALLY BIZARRE.

NOTHING LIKE THE LIFE I'VE LED SO FAR.

16

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA (CONT'D)

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

THERE'LL BE MAGIC, THERE'LL BE FUN.

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

I COULD BE NOTICED BY SOMEONE.

AND I KNOW IT IS TOTALLY CRAZY

TO DREAM I'D FIND ROMANCE.

BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

AT LEAST I'VE GOT A CHANCE!

ELSA

DON'T LET THEM IN.

DON'T LET THEM SEE.

BE THE GOOD GIRL

YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE.

ELSA (CONT'D)

CONCEAL. DON'T FEEL.

PUT ON A SHOW.

MAKE ONE WRONG MOVE

AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW.

ELSA (CONT'D)

BUT IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY.

ANNA

IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY!

ELSA

IT'S AGONY TO WAIT.

ANNA

IT'S AGONY TO WAIT!!!

ELSA

TELL THE GUARDS TO OPEN UP THE GATE.

ANNA

THE GATE!!!

17

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA (CONT'D)                              ELSA

ANNA                                   ELSA

ANNA                                   ELSA

ANNA (CONT'D)

I KNOW IT ALL ENDS TOMORROW,

SO IT HAS TO BE TODAY!!

`CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

FOREVER. . .

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER!

NOTHING'S IN MY WAY!!!

ANNA (CONT'D)

(frustrated)

Hey!

HANS

I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

ANNA

(gentler)

Hey. I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.

HANS

Are you sure?

ANNA

Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I

was going. But I'm okay.

ANNA (CONT'D)

I'm great, actually.

18

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS

Oh, thank goodness.

HANS (CONT'D)

(bowing)

Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

ANNA

(curtseying)

Princess Anna of Arendelle.

HANS

Princess...? My Lady.

ANNA

Hi...again.

HANS

Oh boy.

ANNA

Ha. This is awkward. Not you're

awkward, but just because we're--

I'm awkward. You're gorgeous.

(did she just say that?)

Wait, what?

HANS

I'd like to formally apologize for

hitting the Princess of Arendelle

with my horse...and for every

moment after.

ANNA

No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT

Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my

sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash!

`Cuz, you know...

(patting the horse)

Hello.

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA (CONT'D)

But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.

HANS

Just you?

ANNA

...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I

better go. I have to...I better go.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Bye!

HANS

Oh no.

CUT TO:

BISHOP

Your Majesty, the gloves.

KAI (CONT'D)

Princess Anna of Arendelle!

ANNA

Here? Are you sure?

ELSA

...Hi.

ANNA

Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.

ELSA

...You look beautiful.

ANNA

Thank you. You look beautifuller. I

mean, not fuller. You don't look

fuller, but more beautiful.

21

FROZEN - J. Lee

ELSA

Thank you.

ELSA (CONT'D)

So, this is what a party looks

like?

ANNA

It's warmer than I thought.

ELSA

And what is that amazing smell?

ANNA AND ELSA (TOGETHER)

...Chocolate.

KAI

Your Majesty. The Duke of

Weaseltown.

DUKE

Weselton. The Duke of Weselton.

(to Elsa)

Your Majesty, as your closest

partner in trade, it seems only

fitting that I offer you your first

dance as queen.

DUKE (CONT'D)

(whispers to himself)

One, two, three. Jump.

ELSA

(to the Duke)

Thank you...only I don't dance.

22

FROZEN - J. Lee

DUKE

(offended)

Oh...?

ELSA

But my sister does.

ANNA

What?

DUKE

Lucky you....

ANNA

Oh, I don't think--

DUKE

If you swoon, let me know, I'll

catch you.

ELSA

Sorry.

DUKE

Like an agile peacock... CLUCK-

CLUGGLE-CLUCK!

ANNA

Ow. Ow.

DUKE

Speaking of, so great to have the

gates open. Why did they shut them

in the first place? Do you know the

reason? Hmm?

ANNA

...No.

23

FROZEN - J. Lee

DUKE

Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't

call me the little dipper for

nothing.

DUKE (CONT'D)

(groove fully on)

Like a chicken...with the face of a

monkey...I fly.

JUMP CUT TO:

DUKE (O.S.)

Let me know when you're ready for

another round, M'Lady.

ELSA

Well, he was sprightly.

ANNA

(rubbing her sore feet)

Especially for a man in heels.

ELSA

Are you okay?

ANNA

(loving Elsa's attention)

I've never been better. This is so

nice. I wish it could be like this

all the time.

ELSA

(sincere)

Me too....

ELSA (CONT'D)

But it can't.

ANNA

Why not? If--

ELSA

It just can't.

24

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Excuse me for a minute.

HANS

Glad I caught you.

ANNA

Hans.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNA (CONT'D)

I often had the whole parlor to

myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNA (CONT'D)

...Your physique helps I'm sure.

DISSOLVE TO:

HANS

(about her white streak)

What's this?

ANNA

I was born with it, although I

dreamt I was kissed by a troll.

HANS

I like it.

DISSOLVE TO:

25

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Yeah, the whole thing! You got it.

ANNA(CONT'D)

Okay wait, wait. So you have how

many brothers?

HANS

Twelve older brothers. Three of

them pretended I was invisible...

literally...for two years.

ANNA

That's horrible.

HANS

It's what brothers do.

ANNA

...And sisters. Elsa and I were

really close when we were little.

But then, one day she just shut me

out, and I never knew why.

HANS

I would never shut you out.

ANNA

Okay, can I just say something

crazy?

HANS

I love crazy.

"Love is an Open Door"

ANNA

(singing)

ALL MY LIFE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF

DOORS IN MY FACE.

AND THEN SUDDENLY I BUMP INTO YOU.

HANS

I was thinking the same thing,

because like. . .

26

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS (CONT'D)

I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY WHOLE LIFE

TO FIND MY OWN PLACE.

AND MAYBE IT'S THE PARTY TALKING,

OR THE CHOCOLATE FONDUE.

ANNA

BUT WITH YOU-

HANS

BUT WITH YOU,

I FOUND MY PLACE.

ANNA

I SEE YOUR FACE.

BOTH

AND IT'S NOTHING LIKE I'VE EVER

KNOWN BEFORE.

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS

WE FINISH EACH OTHER'S-

ANNA

SANDWICHES!

HANS

That's what I was gonna say!

ANNA

I'VE NEVER MET SOMEONE-

BOTH

WHO THINKS SO MUCH LIKE ME.

BOTH (SPOKEN) (CONT'D)

Jinx.. . .jinx again.

BOTH (CONT'D)

OUR MENTAL SYNCHRONIZATION

CAN HAVE BUT ONE EXPLANATION,

HANS

YOU-

ANNA

AND I-

HANS

WERE-

ANNA

JUST-

BOTH

MEANT TO BE.

ANNA

SAY GOODBYE-

HANS

SAY GOODBYE-

28

FROZEN - J. Lee

WE DON'T HAVE TO FEEL IT ANYMORE!

HANS

Can I say something crazy...? Will

you marry me?

ANNA

Can I just say something even

crazier? Yes.

CUT TO:

29

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just

get around you there? Thank you.

Oh, there she is. Elsa!

ANNA (CONT'D)

I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um.

May I present Prince Hans of the

Southern Isles.

HANS

(bowing)

Your Majesty.

ANNA

We would like--

HANS

--your blessing--

ANNA

--of--

ANNA/HANS

--our marriage!

ELSA

Marriage...?

ANNA

Yes!

ELSA

I'm sorry, I'm confused.

ANNA

Well, we haven't worked out all the

details ourselves. We'll need a few

days to plan the ceremony. Of

course we'll have soup, roast, and

ice cream and then--

Wait. Would we live here?

ELSA

Here?

30

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS

Absolutely!

ELSA

Anna--

ANNA

Oh, we can invite all twelve of

your brothers to stay with us--

ELSA

What? No, no, no, no, no.

ANNA

Of course we have the room. I don't

know. Some of them must--

ELSA

Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers

are staying here. No one is getting

married.

ANNA

Wait, what?

ELSA

May I talk to you, please. Alone.

ANNA

No. Whatever you have to say, you-

you can say to both of us.

ELSA

Fine. You can't marry a man you

just met.

ANNA

You can if it's true love.

ELSA

Anna, what do you know about true

love?

ANNA

More than you. All you know is how

to shut people out.

ELSA

You asked for my blessing, but my

answer is no. Now, excuse me.

31

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS

Your Majesty, if I may ease your--

ELSA

(flustered)

No, you may not. And I-I think you

should go.

ELSA (CONT'D)

The party is over. Close the gates.

ANNA

What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

ELSA

Give me my glove!

ANNA

(desperate)

Elsa, please. Please. I can't live

like this anymore.

ELSA

(weak)

...Then leave.

ANNA

(heartbroken)

...What did I ever do to you?!

ELSA

Enough, Anna.

ANNA

No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!

Why do you shut the world out?!

What are you so afraid of?!

ELSA

I said, enough!

32

FROZEN - J. Lee

DUKE

(ducking behind his men)

...Sorcery. I knew there was

something dubious going on here.

ANNA

Elsa...?

CUT TO:

CROWD

There she is. Your Majesty! Long

live the Queen! Queen Elsa.... Come

drink with us.

BOWING TOWNSMAN

Queen Elsa.

TOWNSWOMAN WITH BABY

Your Majesty? Are you all right?

DUKE

There she is! Stop her!

ELSA

(to the Duke)

Please, just stay away from me.

Stay away!

DUKE

Monster.... Monster!

33

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Elsa!

ANNA (CONT'D)

Elsa! Wait, please!

ANNA (CONT'D)

Elsa, stop!

HANS

Anna!

ANNA

No.

HANS

(shocked)

Look.... The fjord.

CROWD WALLAH

Snow? It's...snow...in July.

34

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS

...Are you all right?

ANNA

(in shock)

No.

HANS

Did you know?

ANNA

No.

DUKE

Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!

The Queen has cursed this land! She

must be stopped!

(to his thugs)

You have to go after her.

ANNA

Wait, no!

DUKE

You! Is there sorcery in you, too?

Are you a monster, too?

ANNA

No. No. I'm completely ordinary.

HANS

That's right she is...

(realizing how that

sounds)

...in the best way.

ANNA

...And my sister's not a monster.

DUKE

She nearly killed me.

HANS

You slipped on ice.

DUKE

Her ice!

35

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

It was an accident. She was scared.

She didn't mean it. She didn't mean

any of this.... Tonight was my

fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one

that needs to go after her.

DUKE

Yes. Fine. Do.

HANS

What?

ANNA

(to the Royal Handler)

Bring me my horse, please.

HANS

Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

ANNA

Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring

her back, and I'll make this right.

HANS

I'm coming with you.

ANNA

No, I need you here to take care of

Arendelle.

HANS

...On my honor.

ANNA

(to the crowd)

I leave Prince Hans in charge!

HANS

(before letting her go)

Are you sure you can trust her? I

don't want you getting hurt.

ANNA

She's my sister; she would never

hurt me.

36

FROZEN - J. Lee

"Let It Go"

ELSA

THE SNOW GLOWS WHITE

ON THE MOUNTAIN TONIGHT,

NOT A FOOTPRINT TO BE SEEN.

A KINGDOM OF ISOLATION

AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M THE QUEEN.

THE WIND IS HOWLING

LIKE THIS SWIRLING STORM INSIDE.

COULDN'T KEEP IT IN,

HEAVEN KNOWS I TRIED. . .

DON'T LET THEM IN,

DON'T LET THEM SEE,

BE THE GOOD GIRL YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO

BE.

CONCEAL,

DON'T FEEL,

DON'T LET THEM KNOW.

WELL, NOW THEY KNOW.

ELSA (CONT'D)

LET IT GO. LET IT GO.

CAN'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE.

ELSA (CONT'D)

LET IT GO. LET IT GO.

TURN AWAY AND SLAM THE DOOR.

I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

SAY.

LET THE STORM RAGE ON.

THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

37

FROZEN - J. Lee

ELSA (CONT'D)

IT'S FUNNY HOW SOME DISTANCE

MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM SMALL.

AND THE FEARS THAT ONCE CONTROLLED ME

CAN'T GET TO ME AT ALL.

IT'S TIME TO SEE

WHAT I CAN DO,

TO TEST THE LIMITS AND BREAK THROUGH.

NO RIGHT, NO WRONG,

NO RULES FOR ME...I'M FREE!

ELSA (CONT'D)

LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

I AM ONE WITH THE WIND AND SKY.

LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME CRY.

HERE I STAND AND HERE I'LL STAY.

ELSA (CONT'D)

LET THE STORM RAGE ON....

ELSA (CONT'D)

MY POWER FLURRIES THROUGH THE AIR

INTO THE GROUND.

MY SOUL IS SPIRALING IN FROZEN

FRACTALS ALL AROUND.

AND ONE THOUGHT CRYSTALLIZES LIKE

AN ICY BLAST-

ELSA (CONT'D)

I'M NEVER GOING BACK,

(back to resolve)

THE PAST IS IN THE PAST!

ELSA (CONT'D)

LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

AND I'LL RISE LIKE THE BREAK OF DAWN.

LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

38

FROZEN - J. Lee

ELSA (CONT'D)

THAT PERFECT GIRL IS GONE.

HERE I STAND IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.

LET THE STORM RAGE ON!!

THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

CUT TO:

ANNA

(shivering)

Elsa! Elsa! It's me, Anna...your

sister who didn't mean to make you

freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's

all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNA (CONT'D)

(hearing a wolf howl)

Of course, none of this would have

happened if she'd just told me her

secret...ha...she's a stinker.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No.

No. No. No.... Oooo-kay.

DISSOLVE TO:

39

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Snow, it had to be snow, she

couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical

magic that covered the f-f-fjords

in white sand and warm --

ANNA (CONT'D)

Fire! WHOA!

ANNA (CONT'D)

(from inside the snowball)

Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold...

ANNA

Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Ooh! And Sauna...

OAKEN (O.S.)

Hoo hoo.

OAKEN (CONT'D)

Big summer blow out. Half off

swimming suits, clogs, and a sun

balm of my own invention, yah?

ANNA

Oh, great. For now, how about

boots. Winter boots...and dresses?

40

FROZEN - J. Lee

OAKEN

(slight disappointment)

That would be in our winter

department.

ANNA

Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has

another young woman, the Queen

perhaps, I don't know, passed

through here?

OAKEN

Only one crazy enough to be out in

this storm is you, dear?

OAKEN (CONT'D)

You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo.

Big summer blow out.

KRISTOFF

(in her face)

Carrots.

ANNA

Huh?

KRISTOFF

Behind you.

ANNA

Oh, right. Excuse me.

OAKEN

(to Kristoff)

A real howler in July, yah? Where

ever could it be coming from?

KRISTOFF

The North Mountain.

41

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

(to herself)

North Mountain.

OAKEN

That'll be forty.

KRISTOFF

Forty? No, ten.

OAKEN

(sweet as pie)

Oh dear, that's no good. See these

are from our winter stock, where

supply and demand have a big

problem.

KRISTOFF

You want to talk about a supply and

demand problem? I sell ice for a

living.

ANNA

Ooh, that's a rough business to be

in right now. I mean, that is

really...

(he shoots her a look)

Ahem. That's unfortunate.

OAKEN

Still forty. But I will throw in a

visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo!

Hi, family.

NAKED FAMILY

Hoo hoo!

KRISTOFF

...Ten's all I got. Help me out.

OAKEN

(isolating the carrots)

Ten will get you this and no more.

42

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Okay, just tell me one thing; what

was happening on the North

Mountain? Did it seem magical?

KRISTOFF

Yes! Now, back up while I deal with

this crook here.

OAKEN

What did you call me?

KRISTOFF

Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!

OAKEN

Bye bye.

KRISTOFF

No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

But I did find us a place to sleep.

And it's free.

OAKEN

(teddy bear)

I'm sorry about this violence. I

will add a quart of lutefisk, so

we'll have good feelings. Just the

outfit and boots, yah?

43

FROZEN - J. Lee

CUT TO:

"Reindeer(s) are Better than People"

KRISTOFF

REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE.

SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)

(throwing his voice)

YEAH, PEOPLE WILL BEAT YOU & CURSE

YOU & CHEAT YOU.

EVERY ONE OF EM'S BAD, EXCEPT YOU.

(speaking)

Oh, thanks, Buddy.

(singing, as Kristoff)

BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN

REINDEERS.

SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I'M RIGHT?

(As Sven)

THAT'S ONCE AGAIN TRUE,

FOR ALL EXCEPT YOU.

(As Kristoff)

YOU GOT ME. LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT.

(As Sven)

GOOD NIGHT.

(As Kristoff)

DON'T LET THE FROSTBITE BITE.

ANNA

Nice duet.

KRISTOFF

Oh, it's just you. What do you

want?

ANNA

I want you to take me up the North

Mountain.

44

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF

I don't take people places.

ANNA

Let me rephrase that...

KRISTOFF

Umph.

ANNA

Take me up the North Mountain....

Please.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Look, I know how to stop this

winter.

KRISTOFF

We leave at dawn.... And you forgot

the carrots for Sven.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Ugh!

ANNA

Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I

didn't--

(catching herself)

We leave now. Right now.

SLAM CUT TO:

45

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF

(trying to scare Anna)

Hang on! We like to go fast!

ANNA

(fearless)

I like fast!

KRISTOFF

Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

This is fresh lacquer. Seriously,

were you raised in a barn?

ANNA

(grossed out)

Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.

KRISTOFF

So tell me, what made the Queen go

all ice-crazy?

ANNA

...Oh well, it was all my fault. I

got engaged but then she freaked

out because I'd only just met him,

you know, that day. And she said

she wouldn't bless the marriage--

KRISTOFF

Wait. You got engaged to someone

you just met?

ANNA

Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she

got mad and then she tried to walk

away, and I grabbed her glove--

KRISTOFF

Hang on. You mean to tell me you

got engaged to someone you just

met?!

46

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Yes. Pay attention. But the thing

is she wore the gloves all the

time, so I just thought, maybe she

has a thing about dirt.

KRISTOFF

Didn't your parents ever warn you

about strangers?

ANNA

Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a

stranger.

KRISTOFF

Oh yeah? What's his last name?

ANNA

...Of-the-Southern-Isles?

KRISTOFF

What's his favorite food?

ANNA

...Sandwiches.

KRISTOFF

Best friend's name?

ANNA

Probably John.

KRISTOFF

Eye color.

ANNA

Dreamy.

KRISTOFF

Foot size...?

ANNA

Foot size doesn't matter.

KRISTOFF

Have you had a meal with him yet?

What if you hate the way he eats?

What if you hate the way he picks

his nose?

ANNA

Picks his nose?

47

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF

And eats it.

ANNA

Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.

KRISTOFF

All men do it.

ANNA

Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's

true love.

KRISTOFF

Doesn't sound like true love.

ANNA

Are you some sort of love expert?

KRISTOFF

No. But I have friends who are.

ANNA

You have friends who are love

experts.... I'm not buying it.

KRISTOFF

(to Anna)

Stop talking.

ANNA

No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--

KRISTOFF

I mean it. SHHH.

KRISTOFF(CONT'D)

Sven, go. Go!

ANNA

What are they?

KRISTOFF

Wolves.

48

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Wolves. What do we do?

KRISTOFF

I've got this. You just...don't

fall off and don't get eaten.

ANNA

But I wanna help.

KRISTOFF

No.

ANNA

Why not?

KRISTOFF

Because I don't trust your

judgement.

ANNA

Excuse me?!

KRISTOFF

Who marries a man she just met?

ANNA

It's true love!

KRISTOFF

(shocked)

Whoa.

ANNA

Christopher!

KRISTOFF

It's Kristoff!

49

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

AH!

ANNA

Duck!

KRISTOFF

You almost set me on fire!

ANNA

But I didn't.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Get ready to jump, Sven!

KRISTOFF

You don't tell him what to do!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

I do!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Jump, Sven!

50

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

(shocked sadness)

...But I just paid it off.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Uh-oh. No, no, no.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

AH! NO, NO, NO!

ANNA (O.S.)

Grab on!

ANNA (CONT'D)

Pull, Sven! Pull!

ANNA (CONT'D)

Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and

everything in it.

ANNA (CONT'D)

And I understand if you don't want

to help me anymore.

KRISTOFF

Of course I don't want to help her

anymore. In fact, this whole thing

has ruined me for helping anyone

ever again.

KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)

But she'll die on her own.

KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)

I can live with that.

51

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)

But you won't get your new sled if

she's dead.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

(knowing he's got a point)

...You know sometimes I really

don't like you.

KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)

(to Anna)

Hold up. We're coming?!

ANNA

(excited)

You are?!

(catching herself)

I mean, sure. I'll let you tag

along.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNA

Arendelle.

KRISTOFF

It's completely frozen.

ANNA

...But it'll be fine. Elsa will

thaw it.

KRISTOFF

Will she?

52

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

(uncertain)

...Yeah. Now come on. This way to

the North Mountain?

KRISTOFF

More like this way.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNA

I never knew winter could be so

beautiful.

OLAF (O.S.)

YEAH...It really is beautiful,

isn't it? But it's so white. You

know, how about a little color?

Must we bleach the joy out of it

all? I'm thinking like maybe some

crimson, chartreuse...

OLAF (CONT'D)

How `bout yellow--no, not yellow.

Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go.

OLAF (CONT'D)

Am I right?

53

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF (CONT'D)

(cheery, to Kristoff)

Hi!

KRISTOFF

You're creepy.

ANNA

I don't want it!

KRISTOFF

Backatchya!

OLAF

Please don't drop me.

ANNA

Don't!

KRISTOFF

Come on, it's just a head.

ANNA

No!

OLAF (O.S.)

All right, we got off to a bad

start.

ANNA

Ew, ew, the body!

OLAF

Wait, what am I looking at right

now? Why are you hanging off the

earth like a bat?

ANNA

(sympathetic)

...Okay. Wait one second.

54

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF

Oooh! Thank you!

ANNA

You're welcome.

OLAF

Now I'm perfect.

ANNA

Well, almost.

OLAF

Woo! Head rush!

ANNA

Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was

just.... Are you okay?

OLAF

Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

I've always wanted a nose.

(going cross-eyed to look

at his tiny nose)

So cute. It's like a little baby

unicorn.

OLAF (CONT'D)

What? Hey! Whoa.

(seeing his now big nose)

Oh, I love it even more! Hah....

All right, let's start this thing

over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I

like warm hugs.

ANNA

Olaf?...That's right, Olaf.

55

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF

...And you are?

ANNA

Oh, um...I'm Anna.

OLAF

And who's the funky-looking donkey

over there?

ANNA

That's Sven.

OLAF

Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?

ANNA

...Sven.

OLAF

Oh. They're--oh, okay....

(accepting it)

Makes things easier for me.

OLAF (CONT'D)

Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss

my nose.

(gushes)

I like you, too!

ANNA

Olaf, did Elsa build you?

OLAF

Yeah. Why?

ANNA

Do you know where she is?

KRISTOFF

(studying the arm)

Fascinating...

OLAF

Yeah. Why?

56

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Do you think you could show us the

way?

OLAF

Yeah. Why?

KRISTOFF

(bending the arm)

How does this work?

OLAF

Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus

here.

(to Anna)

Yeah, why?

KRISTOFF

I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to

bring back summer.

OLAF

(shocked)

Summer?

(sinking into wistfulness)

Oh, I don't know why but I've

always loved the idea of summer,

and sun, and all things hot.

KRISTOFF

Really? I'm guessing you don't have

much experience with heat.

OLAF

Nope. But sometimes I like to close

my eyes and imagine what it'd be

like when summer does come.

I'm coming!

KRISTOFF

Somebody's got to tell him.

DISSOLVE TO:

59

FROZEN - J. Lee

CITIZEN ONE

No. No. You've got the bark facing

CITIZEN TWO

Bark down is drier.

CITIZEN ONE

Bark up.

CITIZEN TWO

Bark down.

CITIZEN ONE

Bark up.

HANS

Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

GERDA

Arendelle is indebted to you, Your

Highness.

HANS

The castle is open. There's soup

and hot glogg in the Great Hall.

HANS (CONT'D)

Here. Pass these out.

DUKE

Prince Hans, are we just expected

to sit here and freeze while you

give away all of Arendelle's

tradable goods?

HANS

(tall and confident)

Princess Anna has given her orders

and--

60

FROZEN - J. Lee

DUKE

And that's another thing; has it

dawned on you that your princess

may be conspiring with a wicked

sorceress to destroy us all?

HANS

Do not question the Princess. She

left me in charge, and I will not

hesitate to protect Arendelle from

treason.

DUKE

(flabbergasted, offended)

Treason?!

HANS

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

CROWD

(various)

Princess Anna's horse. What

happened to her? Where is she?

HANS

...Princess Anna is in trouble.

(calling out)

I need volunteers to go with me to

find her!

DUKE

I volunteer two men, my Lord!

(quietly to his thugs)

Be prepared for anything, and

should you encounter the Queen, you

are to put an end to this winter.

Do you understand?

CUT TO:

61

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF

So how exactly are you planning to

stop this weather?

ANNA

(confident)

Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.

KRISTOFF

That's your plan? My ice business

is riding on you talking to your

sister.

ANNA

Yup.

KRISTOFF

So you're not at all afraid of her?

ANNA

Why would I be?

OLAF

(oblivious)

Yeah. I bet Elsa's the nicest,

gentlest, warmest person ever.

OLAF (CONT'D)

Oh, look at that. I've been

impaled.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANNA

What now?

62

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF

...It's too steep. I've only got

one rope, and you don't know how to

climb mountains.

ANNA (O.S.)

Says who?

KRISTOFF

(finding her ridiculous)

What are you doing?

ANNA

(straining)

...I'm going to see my sister.

KRISTOFF

You're going to kill yourself.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

I wouldn't put my foot there.

ANNA (O.S.)

You're distracting me.

KRISTOFF

Or there. How do you know Elsa even

wants to see you?

ANNA (O.S.)

I'm just blocking you out cause I

gotta concentrate here.

KRISTOFF

You know, most people who disappear

into the mountains want to be

alone.

ANNA (O.S.)

Nobody wants to be alone. Except

maybe you--

KRISTOFF

I'm not alone.... I have friends,

remember?

63

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

You mean the love experts?

KRISTOFF

Yes, the love experts!

ANNA

...Please tell me I'm almost there.

ANNA (CONT'D)

...Does the air seem a bit thin to

you up here?

KRISTOFF

Hang on.

OLAF

Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is

going to solve the problem, but I

found a staircase that leads

exactly where you want it to go.

ANNA

Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

ANNA (CONT'D)

Thanks! That was like a crazy trust

exercise.

ANNA

Whoa.

KRISTOFF

(in awe)

Now that's ice. I might cry.

64

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Go ahead. I won't judge.

KRISTOFF

All right, take it easy. I gotcha.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

You stay right here, buddy.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

...Flawless.

OLAF

...Knock....

(she doesn't)

Just knock....

(she doesn't. To Kristoff)

Why isn't she knocking...? Do you

think she knows how to knock?

ANNA

Ha. It opened. That's a first.

ANNA (CONT'D)

You should probably wait out here.

KRISTOFF

What?

ANNA

Last time I introduced her to a

guy, she froze everything.

KRISTOFF

But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice

is my life.

65

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF

Bye, Sven.

ANNA

You too, Olaf.

OLAF

Me?

ANNA

Just give us a minute.

OLAF

Okay.

OLAF (CONT'D)

One...two...

OLAF AND KRISTOFF

Three...four...

ANNA

Elsa? It's me...Anna?!

ELSA (O.S.)

Anna.

ANNA

Elsa, you look different.... It's a

good different.... And this place

is amazing.

66

FROZEN - J. Lee

ELSA

(cautious, polite)

Thank you, I never knew what I was

capable of.

ANNA

...I'm so sorry about what

happened. If I'd known--

ELSA

(on guard)

No, it's okay. You don't have to

apologize.... But you should

probably go, please.

ANNA

But I just got here.

ELSA

...You belong in Arendelle.

ANNA

So do you.

ELSA

No, I belong here. Alone. Where I

can be who I am without hurting

anybody.

ANNA

...Actually, about that--

OLAF (O.S.)

58...59...60.

ELSA

Wait. What is that?

OLAF

Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

ELSA

(shocked)

Olaf?

67

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF

(bashful)

You built me. You remember that?

ELSA

(astonished)

And you're alive?

OLAF

Um...I think so?

ANNA

He's just like the one we built as

kids.... We were so close. We can

be like that again.

FLASH CUT TO:

YOUNG ELSA

Anna!

FLASH CUT TO:

ELSA

No, we can't.

ELSA (CONT'D)

Goodbye, Anna.

ANNA

Elsa, wait--

You don't have to protect me. I'm

not afraid. Please don't shut me

out again.

YOU MEAN WELL,

YES, I'M ALONE BUT I'M ALONE AND

FREE.

ELSA (CONT'D)

JUST STAY AWAY AND YOU'LL BE SAFE

FROM ME.

ANNA

ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT.

ELSA

WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT?

69

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW?

ELSA

WHAT DO I NOT KNOW?

ANNA

ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP

SNOW.

ELSA

What?

ANNA

You kind of set off an eternal

winter...everywhere.

ELSA

Everywhere?

ANNA

It's okay, you can just unfreeze

it.

ELSA

No, I can't. I don't know how.

ANNA

Sure you can. I know you can.

ANNA (CONT'D)

CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

ELSA

(panicking)

I'M SUCH A FOOL!

I CAN'T BE FREE!

YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

ELSA

ELSA

I CAN'T CONTROL THE CURSE!

ANNA

WE'LL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE

MADE.

ELSA

ANNA, PLEASE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT

WORSE!

ANNA

DON'T PANIC.

ELSA

THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR!

ANNA

WE'LL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT.

ELSA

YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE!

ANNA

WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...

ELSA

NO!

ANNA (O.S.)

WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER,

AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...

ELSA

I CAN'T!

KRISTOFF

Anna. Are you okay?

71

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

I'm okay.... I'm fine.

ELSA

(scared)

Who's this? Wait, it doesn't

matter. You have to go.

ANNA

No, I know we can figure this out

together--

ELSA

(desperate)

How? What power do you have to stop

this winter? To stop me?

KRISTOFF

Anna, I think we should go.

ANNA

(close to tears)

No. I'm not leaving without you,

Elsa.

ELSA

(heartbroken but decisive)

Yes, you are.

SLAM CUT TO:

ANNA

Stop. Put us down!

OLAF

You are a lot stronger than I think

you realize.

Go away!

OLAF (O.S.)

Heads up!

ANNA

Olaf!

OLAF

Watch out for my butt!

ANNA

It is not nice to throw people!

KRISTOFF                                   ANNA

KRISTOFF

Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!

OLAF

...I'll distract him. You guys go.

OLAF (CONT'D)

No, no, not you guys.

73

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF (CONT'D)

(muffled)

This just got a whole lot harder.

KRISTOFF

This way!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

(impressed)

Ho-ho-ho!

ANNA

I got him!

KRISTOFF

Whoa, stop!

ANNA

It's a hundred foot drop.

KRISTOFF

It's two hundred.

ANNA

Ow.

ANNA (CONT'D)

What's that for?

KRISTOFF

I'm digging a snow anchor.

74

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

(not trusting)

Okay. What if we fall?

KRISTOFF

There's twenty feet of fresh powder

down there; it'll be like landing

on a pillow.... Hopefully.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Okay, Anna. On three.

ANNA

Okay. You tell me when...

KRISTOFF

One...

ANNA

...I'm ready to go....

KRISTOFF

Two...

ANNA

(pumped up)

...I was BORN ready! Yes!

KRISTOFF

Calm down.

ANNA (O.S.)

TREE!

KRISTOFF

Whoa! That happened.

OLAF

Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.

75

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF (CONT'D)

There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!

Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost

Marshmallow back there!

OLAF (CONT'D)

(happily)

Hey. We were just talking about

you. All good things, all good

things.

OLAF (CONT'D)

NO!

OLAF (CONT'D)

This is not making much of a

difference!

OLAF (CONT'D)

Wait, what?

KRISTOFF

Aargghh!

ANNA

Kristoff!

76

FROZEN - J. Lee

MARSHMALLOW

Don't come back!

ANNA

(grossed out by his snow

breath)

Ugh. We won't.

ANNA (CONT'D)

Hey, you were right. Just like a

pillow.

OLAF

(shaking the boots)

I can't feel my legs! I can't feel

my legs!

KRISTOFF

Those are my legs.

OLAF

Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my

butt.

OLAF (CONT'D)

Oh, that feels better.

OLAF (CONT'D)

Hey, Sven!

77

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF (CONT'D)

He found us.

(to Sven, funny voice)

Who's my cute little reindeer?

KRISTOFF

Don't talk to him like that.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Here.

ANNA

(impressed)

Whoa!

KRISTOFF

You okay?

ANNA

Thank you.

ANNA (CONT'D)

...Um.... How's your head?

KRISTOFF

(in pain)

Ah! Ooh!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good.

Ha. I've got a thick skull.

OLAF

I don't have a skull.... Or bones.

KRISTOFF

...So....

78

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

(shy)

Now what?

ANNA

(shy)

Now what?

(then...panicking)

Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do?

She threw me out. I can't go back

to Arendelle with the weather like

this. And then there's your ice

business--

KRISTOFF

Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice

business...

(noticing something)

Worry about your hair?!

ANNA

What? I just fell off a cliff. You

should see your hair.

KRISTOFF

No, yours is turning white.

ANNA

White? It's what?

KRISTOFF

It's because she struck you; isn't

it?

ANNA

Does it look bad?

KRISTOFF

(thinking)

...No.

OLAF

You hesitated.

KRISTOFF

No, I didn't. Anna, you need help.

Now, come on.

79

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF

Okay! Where are we going?

KRISTOFF

To see my friends.

ANNA

(catching up)

The love experts?

OLAF

Love experts?!

KRISTOFF

Yes. And don't worry; they'll be

able to fix this.

ANNA

How do you know?

KRISTOFF

...Because I've seen them do it

before.

OLAF

I like to consider myself a love

expert.

CUT TO:

ELSA

(mantra-style)

Get it together. Control it. Don't

feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL!

DISSOLVE TO:

80

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF

Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

KRISTOFF

Are you cold?

ANNA

...A little.

KRISTOFF

Wait. Come here.

ANNA

Oooh.... That's nice.

KRISTOFF

(taking a deep breath)

So, about my friends...well, I say

friends, they're more like

family.... Anyway, when I was a

kid, it was just me and

Sven...until they took me in.

ANNA

(moved)

They did?

KRISTOFF

(nervous ramble)

Yeah. I don't want to scare you,

they can be a little bit

inappropriate...and loud...very

loud...they're also stubborn at

times, and a little overbearing.

And heavy. Really, really heavy.

(MORE)

81

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

But they're fine.. You'll get it.

They mean well.

ANNA

Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

KRISTOFF

Okay then....

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Meet my family.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

(to the rocks)

Hey, guys!

ANNA

(to herself)

...They're rocks.

OLAF

(realizing)

He's crazy.

(covertly, to Anna)

I'll distract them while you run.

(Loud and slow to a rock)

Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to

meet you!

(quietly to Anna)

Anna, because I love you, I insist

you run.

(to the rock)

I understand you're love experts!

(to Anna)

Why aren't you running?

ANNA

Okay. Um...I'm gonna go--

82

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA (CONT'D)

(panicking)

Kristoff!

BULDA

KRISTOFF'S HOME!

TROLLS (VARIOUS)

Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's

been too long! Kristoff's home!

OLAF

(excitedly)

Kristoff's home.

OLAF (CONT'D)

Wait? Kristoff?

TROLL ONE

Oh, lemme look at you!

TROLL TWO

Oh, take off your clothes,

Kristoff; I wash them.

KRISTOFF

(holding up his pants)

Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes

on, thank you.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Great to see you all. Where's

grandpa?

MUSHROOM KID TROLL

He's napping. But look, I grew a

mushroom.

TROLL SCOUT KID

And I earned my fire crystal.

83

FROZEN - J. Lee

KIDNEY STONE TROLL

I passed a kidney stone.

PICK ME UP TROLL

Pick me up.

ANNA

Trolls? They're trolls.

BULDA

...He's brought a girl!

TROLLS (TOGETHER)

He's brought a girl!

ANNA

What's going on?

KRISTOFF

I've learned to just roll with it.

BULDA

Let me see. Bright eyes. Working

nose. Strong teeth. Yes, yes, yes.

She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

ANNA

Wait. Oh. Um. No.

KRISTOFF

You've got the wrong idea. That's

not why I brought her here.

ANNA

Right. We're not. I'm not--

84

FROZEN - J. Lee

BULDA

(to Anna)

What's the issue, dear? Why are you

holding back from such a man?

"Fixer-Upper"

TROLLS (VARIOUS)

IS IT THE CLUMPY WAY HE WALKS?

OR THE GRUMPY WAY HE TALKS?

OR THE PEAR-SHAPED, SQUARE-SHAPED

WEIRDNESS OF HIS FEET?

AND THOUGH WE KNOW HE WASHES WELL

HE ALWAYS ENDS UP SORTA SMELLY.

BUT YOU'LL NEVER MEET A FELLA WHO'S

AS SENSITIVE AND SWEET.

TROLLS (CHORUS) (CONT'D)

SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,

SO HE'S GOT A FEW FLAWS-

HIS PECULIAR BRAIN, DEAR.

HIS THING FOR THE REINDEER

THAT OUTSIDE A FEW OF NATURE'S

LAWS.

SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,

BUT THIS WE'RE CERTAIN OF-

YOU CAN FIX THIS FIXER UPPER UP

WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE.

KRISTOFF

Can we just stop talking about

this?! We've got a real, actual

problem here.

BULDA

I'll say--

(To Anna)

IS IT THE WAY THAT HE RUNS SCARED?

TROLLS (VARIOUS)

OR THAT HE'S SOCIALLY IMPAIRED?

KID TROLL

OR THAT HE ONLY LIKES TO TINKLE IN

THE WOODS?

TROLLS (VARIOUS)

ARE YOU HOLDING BACK YOUR FONDNESS

DUE TO HIS UNMANLY BLONDENESS?

OR THE WAY HE COVERS UP THAT HE'S

THE HONEST GOODS?

85

FROZEN - J. Lee

TROLLS (CHORUS) (CONT'D)

HE'S JUST A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER-

HE'S GOT A COUPLE A' BUGS.

KRISTOFF

No, I don't.

TROLLS

HIS ISOLATION

IS CONFIRMATION

OF HIS DESPERATION FOR HEALING

HUGS.

SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,

BUT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.

THE WAY TO FIX UP THIS FIXER UPPER

IS TO FIX HIM UP WITH YOU.

KRISTOFF

(to the male trolls)

Enough! She's engaged to someone

else. Okay?!

TROLLS (VARIOUS)

SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,

THAT'S A MINOR THING.

THIS QUOTE "ENGAGEMENT"

IS A FLEX ARRANGEMENT.

KID TROLL

AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T SEE NO

RING.

TROLLS (VARIOUS)

SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,

HER BRAIN'S A BIT BETWIXT.

GET THE FIANCE

OUT OF THE WAY

AND THE WHOLE THING WILL BE FIXED!

GIRL TROLLS

WE AREN'T SAYING YOU CAN CHANGE HIM

TROLLS (VARIOUS)

'CAUSE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CHANGE.

WE'RE ONLY SAYING THAT LOVE'S A

FORCE

THAT'S POWERFUL AND STRANGE.

PEOPLE MAKE BAD CHOICES

IF THEY'RE MAD OR SCARED OR

STRESSED.

(MORE)

86

FROZEN - J. Lee

TROLLS (VARIOUS) (CONT'D)

BUT THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY

(THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY)

AND YOU'LL BRING OUT THEIR BEST!

TRUE LOVE BRINGS OUT THE BEST!

ALL TROLLS

EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,

THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT

FATHER, SISTER, BROTHER

WE NEED EACH OTHER

TO RAISE US UP AND ROUND US OUT

TROLLS

EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,

BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE-

THE ONLY FIXER UPPER FIXER THAT CAN

FIX A FIXER UPPER IS

TRUE

TRUE

TRUE

TRUE

LOVE

TROLL PRIEST

Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be

your trollfully wedded--

ANNA

Wait, what?!

TROLL PRIEST

You're getting married.

TROLLS

LOVE!

KRISTOFF

Anna?

87

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

She's as cold as ice.

GRAND PABBIE

There's strange magic here!

KRISTOFF

Grand Pabbie!

GRAND PABBIE

Bring her to me, Kristoff.

GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)

Anna, your life is in danger. There

is ice in your heart, put there by

your sister. If not removed, to

solid ice will you freeze, forever.

ANNA

What...? No.

KRISTOFF

So remove it, Grand Pabbie.

GRAND PABBIE

I can't. If it was her head, that

would be easy. But only an act of

true love can thaw a frozen heart.

ANNA

An act of true love?

BULDA

(googley, to her hubby)

A true love's kiss, perhaps?

KRISTOFF

Anna, we've got to get you back to

Hans.

ANNA

(still weak)

...Hans.

88

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF

Help us out, Sven.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Come on, Olaf!

OLAF

I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who

is this Hans?!

CUT TO:

HANS

We are here to find Princess Anna.

Be on guard, but no harm is to come

to the Queen. Do you understand?

MARSHMALLOW

Go away!

DUKE'S THUG

The Queen.

89

FROZEN - J. Lee

ELSA

(scared)

No. Please.

ELSA (CONT'D)

Stay away!

THUG

Get her! Get her!

90

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS

Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster

they fear you are.

CUT TO BLACK.

ELSA

No....What have I done?

ELSA (CONT'D)

Why did you bring me here?

HANS

I couldn't just let them kill you.

91

FROZEN - J. Lee

ELSA

But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get

Anna.

HANS

Anna has not returned....

HANS (CONT'D)

If you would just stop the winter,

bring back summer...please.

ELSA

Don't you see...I can't.

ELSA (CONT'D)

You have to tell them to let me go.

HANS

I will do what I can.

CUT TO:

KRISTOFF

Just hang in there.

(to Sven)

Come on, buddy, faster!

OLAF

I'll meet you guys at the castle!

92

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF

Stay out of sight, Olaf!

OLAF

I will!

OLAF (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Hello!

TOWNSWOMAN (O.S.)

Ah! It's alive!

CUT TO:

GUARD

It's Princess Anna!

KRISTOFF

I've got you.

ANNA

...Are you g-gonna be okay?

KRISTOFF

(touched, reassuring)

Don't worry about me.

GERDA

Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick.

KAI

My Lady. You are freezing.

GERDA

You poor girl, you're freezing.

Let's get you inside.

93

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF

Get her warm and find Prince Hans,

immediately.

KAI

We will. Thank you.

KRISTOFF

Make sure she's safe!

CUT TO:

HANS

I'm going back out to look for

Princess Anna.

FRENCH DIGNITARY

You cannot risk going out there

again.

HANS

If anything happens to her--

SPANISH DIGNITARY

If anything happens to the

Princess, you are all Arendelle has

left.

KAI

He's in here. Prince Hans.

HANS

Anna.

94

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS (CONT'D)

You're so cold.

ANNA

(weak, but desperate)

Hans, you have to kiss me.

HANS

What?

ANNA

Now. Here we go.

GERDA

We'll give you two some privacy.

HANS

What happened out there?

ANNA

Elsa struck me with her powers.

HANS

You said she'd never hurt you.

ANNA

I was wrong.

HANS

Anna.

ANNA

(shivering more)

She froze my heart and only an act

of true love can save me.

HANS

(understanding)

A true love's kiss.

95

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS (CONT'D)

Oh, Anna. If only there was someone

out there who loved you.

ANNA

What?

ANNA (CONT'D)

...You said you did.

HANS

As thirteenth in line in my own

kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I

knew I'd have to marry into the

throne somewhere--

ANNA

What are you talking about?

HANS

(putting out the candles)

As heir, Elsa was preferable, of

course. But no one was getting

anywhere with her. But you-

ANNA

Hans?

HANS

You were so desperate for love you

were willing to marry me, just like

that.

HANS (CONT'D)

I figured, after we married, I'd

have to stage a little accident for

Elsa.

ANNA

Hans. No, stop.

96

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS

But then she doomed herself, and

you were dumb enough to go after

her.

ANNA

Please.

HANS

(chuckles)

All that's left now is to kill Elsa

and bring back summer.

ANNA

...You're no match for Elsa.

HANS

No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on

the other hand, am the hero who is

going to save Arendelle from

destruction.

ANNA

(anger)

You won't get away with this.

HANS

Oh, I already have.

ANNA

(hoarse and weak)

Please, somebody help.

CUT TO:

97

FROZEN - J. Lee

DUKE

It's getting colder by the minute.

If we don't do something soon,

we'll all freeze to death.

SPANISH DIGNITARY

Prince Hans.

HANS

Princess Anna is...dead.

VARIOUS DIGNITARIES

What...? No.... Mon dieu.

DUKE

What happened to her?

HANS

She was killed by Queen Elsa.

DUKE

Her own sister.

HANS

(really putting it on)

At least we got to say our marriage

vows...before she died in my arms.

DUKE

There can be no doubt now; Queen

Elsa is a monster and we are all in

grave danger.

SPANISH DIGNITARY

Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to

you.

98

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS

With a heavy heart, I charge Queen

Elsa of Arendelle with treason and

sentence her to death.

GUARD (O.S.)

She's dangerous. Move quickly and

with resolve.

CUT TO:

KRISTOFF

What is it, buddy?

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Hey, watch it. What's wrong with

you?

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

(avoiding)

...I don't understand you when you

talk like that.

99

FROZEN - J. Lee

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

No, Sven! We're not going back!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

She's with her true love.

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Anna.

CUT TO:

ANNA

(barely a whisper)

Help.

OLAF

Anna. Oh no.

100

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.

OLAF

Whoa! So this is heat....

(considering)

I love it.

OLAF (CONT'D)

Ooh! But don't touch it!

OLAF (CONT'D)

So, where's Hans? What happened to

your kiss?

ANNA

I was wrong about him. It wasn't

true love.

OLAF

(confused innocence)

Huh. But we ran all the way here?

ANNA

Please Olaf, you can't stay here;

you'll melt.

OLAF

I am not leaving here until we find

some other act of true love to save

you.

OLAF (CONT'D)

...Do you happen to have any ideas?

ANNA

I don't even know what love is.

OLAF

(confident)

That's okay, I do....

101

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF (CONT'D)

Love is...putting someone else's

needs before yours, like, you know,

how Kristoff brought you back here

to Hans and left you forever.

ANNA

...Kristoff loves me?

OLAF

Wow, you really don't know anything

about love, do you?

ANNA

Olaf, you're melting.

OLAF

(sweet and reassuring)

Some people are worth melting for.

OLAF (CONT'D)

Just maybe not right this second.

OLAF (CONT'D)

Don't worry, I've got it!

OLAF (CONT'D)

(determined)

We're going to get through--

(distracted)

Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting

something.

OLAF (CONT'D)

It's Kristoff and Sven! They're

coming back this way.

ANNA

...They-they are?

102

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF

Wow, he's really moving fast.

Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I

guess Kristoff doesn't love you

enough to leave you behind.

ANNA

Help me up, Olaf. Please.

OLAF

No, no, no, no, no. You need to

stay by the fire and keep warm.

ANNA

I need to get to Kristoff.

OLAF

(clueless)

Why...?

(realizing)

Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

OLAF (CONT'D)

There's your act of true love,

right there, riding across the

fjords like a valiant, pungent

reindeer king! Come on!

OLAF (CONT'D)

Look out!

OLAF

We're trapped.

103

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF

Slide, Anna.

OLAF (CONT'D)

We made it!

KRISTOFF

Come on, buddy, faster.

CUT TO:

ANNA

Kristoff!

OLAF

Keep going, Anna!

104

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Kristoff!

PAN TO:

KRISTOFF

Come on! Come on!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Sven? Sven!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

Good boy.

ANNA (O.S.)

Kristoff.

KRISTOFF

Anna...? Anna!

WHITE OUT TO:

105

FROZEN - J. Lee

HANS

Elsa. You can't run from this!

ELSA

...Just take care of my sister.

HANS

Your sister? She returned from the

mountain weak and cold. She said

you froze her heart.

ELSA

What? No.

HANS

I tried to save her, but it was too

late. Her skin was ice. Her hair

turned white...

HANS (CONT'D)

Your sister is dead... because of

you.

ANNA

(a whisper)

Kristoff.

KRISTOFF

Anna.

106

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA

Elsa.

ANNA (CONT'D)

No!

ELSA

Anna!

ELSA (CONT'D)

Oh, Anna...no...no, please no.

OLAF

(confused, sad)

Anna?

ELSA

Wha-? Anna?

ANNA

Oh, Elsa.

107

FROZEN - J. Lee

ELSA

...You sacrificed yourself for me?

ANNA

(weak)

...I love you.

OLAF

An act of true love will thaw a

frozen heart.

ELSA

(processing)

Love...will thaw...

(realizing)

Love.... Of course.

ANNA

Elsa?

ELSA

Love.

ANNA

I knew you could do it.

OLAF

(melting, good-naturedly)

Hands down, this is the best day of

my life...and quite possibly the

last.

ELSA

Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.

108

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF

Hey, my own personal flurry.

ANNA

Uh. Uh. Uh.

HANS

(confused)

Anna? But she froze your heart.

ANNA

The only frozen heart around here

is yours.

HANS

Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

DISSOLVE TO:

FRENCH DIGNITARY

(to Kai)

I will return this scoundrel to his

country. We shall see what his

twelve big brothers think of his

behavior.

KAI

Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.

109

FROZEN - J. Lee

DUKE

This is unacceptable. I am

innocent. I'm a victim of fear.

I've been traumatized.

(bad acting)

Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a

doctor I could...No? And I demand

to see the Queen!

KAI

I have a message from the Queen.

(reading a scroll)

Arendelle will henceforth and

forever no longer do business of

any sort with Weaseltown.

DUKE

Weselton. It's Weselton!

ANNA

Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

KRISTOFF

Pole.

ANNA

Oops. Sorry.

ANNA

(stopping)

Okay. Okay. Here we are.

110

FROZEN - J. Lee

ANNA (CONT'D)

I owe you a sled.

KRISTOFF

(blown away)

Are you serious?

ANNA

Yes. And it's the latest model.

KRISTOFF

No. I can't accept this...

ANNA

You have to. No returns. No

exchanges. Queen's orders. She's

named you the official Arendelle

Ice Master and Deliverer.

KRISTOFF

What? That's not a thing.

ANNA

Sure it is. And it even has a cup

holder.... Do you like it?

KRISTOFF

Like it?

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

I love it.... I could kiss you!

KRISTOFF (CONT'D)

...I could. I mean I'd like to.

I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may

we? Wait, what?

ANNA

We may.

111

FROZEN - J. Lee

CUT TO:

ELSA

Are you ready?

ANNA

I like the open gates.

ELSA

We are never closing them again.

ANNA

What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,

but you know I don't ska--

KRISTOFF

Look out. Reindeer coming through!

112

FROZEN - J. Lee

OLAF

That's it. Glide and pivot and

glide and pivot.

FINAL FADE OUT.
