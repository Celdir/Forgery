2       INT. CATACOMB BELOW "SPHINX" - DAY

TOTAL RECALL

DISSOLVE TO:

3       INT. BEDROOM IN SMALL APARTMENT - MORNING

CLOCK

(sweetly)

Tick, tock, seven o'clock.  Time

to rise and open your eyes.

CLOCK

(continuing)

Tick, tock, seven-oh-one.  Time

to get up, the day had begun.

CLOCK

(continuing)

Tick, tock --

QUAIL

I dreamed about Mars again... it

was bizarre, yet is was so real...

KIRSTEN

(casual)

It's your time of the month again.

KIRSTEN

(continuing;

world-weary air)

At least once a month.  Douglas

Quail's obsession.  For twelve

years you've been talking about

Mars.

QUAIL

People do go to Mars, you know.

KIRSTEN

That's right, Douglas.  But not

you.  Not us.

KIRSTEN

(continuing;

disdainful)

As it is, we can barely scrape by

on your lousy ten thousand a week.

4       INT. KITCHENETTE - MORNING

KIRSTEN

(mumbling)

What do they expect ... the

way men dress these days ...

then they scream rape.

QUAIL

You know -- let's really do it.

KIRSTEN

Rape men in the park?

QUAIL

No.  Go to Mars.

KIRSTEN

(withering)

Go to hell.

QUAIL

We can pool our savings and

I've got some sick leave

coming, besides my regular

vacation...

KIRSTEN

(interrupting;

corrects herself)

...more of a half-wit.  For

a start a war could break out

there any day ...

QUAIL

That's just media talk.  They're...

(indicating

the protesters)

...just a minority.  They're

powerless.

KIRSTEN

Well, there's a lot of things

we need around here before

we waste our money on a trip

to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm

just a slave around this dump.

Now if you were capable of

finding a better job....

CLOCK

It's now eight.  You'll be

late!

QUAIL

I'll be late!

4A      EXT. CITY - EARLY MORNING

5       INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING

GUARD

No weapon again, Mr. Quail?

QUAIL

I keep forgetting, Herb.  They

frighten me.

GUARD

Yeah?  Well, it's the law,

Mr. Quail.  Has been since

1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow -

ya carry ya gun or ya get

reported.

QUAIL

Okay.  Herb, okay.

6       INT. URBAN TRANSIT TRAIN - DAY

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

-- more violence today from Mars's

strike-torn ore colonies --

NEWSCASTER

(continuing)

...but Earth Intelligence Operations

Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly

worried about the damage to Mars's

all important tourist

industry was today dismissive

of the dissident groups....

COHAAGEN

We're dealing with a bunch of

extremists and unrepresentative

lunatics.  Mars is a happy and

prosperous protectorate of Earth...

and will remain so.

REPORTER (V.O.)

There have been some criticisms,

sir....

COHAAGEN

I have no further comment.

ANNOUNCER

Good morning, commuters.  This

portion of your trip is brought

to you by Rekall, Inc.  Do you

have a dream that never came

true?  Do you aspire - but

only perspire?  Has the great

adventure passed you by?  Then

come to... REKALL, where what

might have been will have been.

For the memories of a

lifetime... REKALL.

6B      INT. QUAIL'S OFFICE - DAY

9       INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - REKALL - DAY

McCLANE

We're all dreamers, Douglas.

But here at Rekall, dreams

are our business.

QUAIL

But... is the process really

that effective?  A false

memory!?

McCLANE

(shaking his head;

smiling)

We prefer the term "extra-

factual implant".  Your

memory will be complete in

every way.  You will have

gone to Mars.  We guarantee

that.

QUAIL

Is it in any way dangerous?

I mean, the medical techniques?

McCLANE

Not when you deal with

qualified operators - like

us.

QUAIL

It's just - incredible.

McCLANE

And look at our follow-up

program!

McCLANE

(continuing)

Space-flight ticket stub...

passport... vaccination

certificates... matchbooks

from Martian Nouvelle Cuisine

Restaurants, souvenirs, post

cards... even names of people

you met - now back there -

who you can call and discuss

your trip with... by the way,

we plant these things where

you'll come across them at

random in the future.

QUAIL

But... I'll know I hired you.

That'll destroy the whole

illusion.

McCLANE

(smiling; self-

satisfied)

But you won't remember me, or

having been here.

QUAIL

I won't?

McCLANE

Your money back if you do!

We've never paid out yet.

McCLANE

(continuing)

And we have a special this

month, for only two-hundred

thousand dollars more.

McCLANE

(continuing)

You can have a new identity

for the duration of the trip.

Pick one.

QUAIL

"Intelligence Agent"... wouldn't

that be dangerous?  I might

attack....

McCLANE

(airily)

No.  No.  You're a retired

agent.  Mars was your last

mission and you're never to

break your cover.  But you'll

have got the girl, killed the

baddies, and saved the

Universe.  Not bad, eh?

QUAIL

I don't know... about the

whole thing... it's all such

a fake.  I won't really have

gone.  I won't really....

McCLANE

(kind but firm)

Let's face it, Douglas, you,

and millions of people like

you have no chance of ever

getting to Mars and you'd

never qualify as a secret

agent for EIO.  This - REKALL

- is the only way to achieve

your dream.

McCLANE

(continuing)

Think about it, Douglas.

Think, too, what a terrible

boor a real holiday is.

Lost tickets, endless arguments,

lousy hotels, missed connections,

rotten weather... Rekall will

supply you with perfect, happy

memories.

9A      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

QUAIL

You know that's illegal.

KIRSTEN

Yeah?  Who's going to report

me?  You?... wimp....

KIRSTEN

(continuing)

Screwing around's illegal,

too.  But just give me half

a chance...

10      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

OLD LADY

Hi, I'm Doctor Sophie Lull.

Sorry I'm late.

(walks toward

coat closet)

I'll be right with you.

QUAIL

(looking at

instrument

console)

This really going to work?

LULL

It the Pope Martian?

ERNIE (TECHNICIAN)

(at machine)

Okay -- that's it.

LULL

Now, just relax, kid.  This

ain't gonna hurt.  Just a

controlled drip of Narkadine.

When you're under, I'll just

ask ya a few questions, nothin'

real personal, just full

details of yer private life

so's we can tailor the

wish-fulfillment program to

your needs.

LULL

(continuing)

See?  Painless.  I didn't feel

a thing.  Hey, you're a nice

kid... you like a little

somethin' extra?

LULL

(continuing;

pleased)

Good!  Kid -- have I got a

girl for you!  She's gonna

like you.  You're good-lookin'.

(beat)

Gettin' sleepy?

(he nods)

Good.  Now, what's the first

thing you think of when you're

thinkin' about Mars?

QUAIL

(wistfully)

Well... I'd like to see the

Martian Sphinx...

LULL

Okay -- you will, Dougle!  I

want ya to start counting

backwards from a hundred for

me.

QUAIL

(sleepily)

One hundred... ninety-nine...

ninety-eight... ninety-seven...

ninety-six... ninety-five....

LULL

Okay, Ernie, the trip to Mars;

number sixty-two... and throw

in that blonde... We'll give

him a real good time.

ERNIE

Sixty-two... and... the blonde...

ERNIE

Boy, is this one wild.  He

won't want to come back.

LULL

Dougie?  This Sophie Lull.

Can ya hear me?

QUAIL

...Sophie....

LULL

Good! ... I'm gonna ask ya

a few more questions now.  Ya

think you'll be able to

answer 'em?

QUAIL

...Yes....

LULL

Attaboy!  To begin with, I

wanna ask ya; -- You sex

life.  How many orgasms a

week?

11      INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - DAY

McCLANE

Yes?

LULL (V.O.)

(filtered;

tense)

Howie?  Listen, you'd better

get in here.

McCLANE

(not too

concerned)

Not another schizoid embolism.

LULL (V.O.)

(filtered)

You'd better get in here.

12      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

LULL

(bends over

Quail)

Quail?  Dougie, can you hear me?

QUAIL

Yes.

LULL

Tell McClane what you told us.

QUAIL

(a deadly

voice)

All of you in this room are

dead.

McCLANE

(not quite

taking it

seriously)

What's he talking about?

QUAIL

You've broken my cover.

McCLANE

What is this?...

LULL

The Narkadine cracked a memory

cap.  Mars --

(she's scared)

He's really been there.

McCLANE

Forced suppression?

ERNIE

With spontaneous breakthrough.

McCLANE

Holy shit.

QUAIL

(coldly)

You've compromised the Sphinx

Project.  You'll have to be

silenced.

McCLANE

Wait a minute.  Quail --

QUAIL

My name isn't Quail.

McCLANE

Listen... whoever you are...

sir....

(almost

pleading)

...This is all an accident.

We'll destroy all the records.

No one will know.  I swear it.

Believe me.

QUAIL

I believe you, but that won't

stop E.T.O. from killing you.

QUAIL

(continuing)

Killing you... killing you...

killing you....

LULL

(intensely)

He wants a false memory

implanted -- of a trip he

really took.

(pause)

Someone at Earth Intelligence

Operations erased his memory.

All he know was going to Mars

meant something special to

him.

ERNIE

What do we do?  Graft a false

memory pattern over the real

memory of the same thing?

LULL

(shaking her

head)

Uh-uh... That could promote

a partial breakthrough of

the real trip.

McCLANE

(overlapping)

Revive him without any false

memory implantation and get

him out of here.

LULL

Why don't we just wipe out

the memory of his visit

here?

McCLANE

(nodding;

relieved)

Yes.  Good.  I'll destroy

his file and cancel his fee.

I have a feeling that the

longer he doesn't know who

he is, where he's been,

where he's going and who we

are, the better off we'll

all be.  I'm taking a holiday.

A real one.

QUAIL

Where am I going?

DRIVER

Thirty-three thirteen "G"

Street, Sector "L", Twin

Towers, Apartment six-thirty-

QUAIL

How did I get here?

DRIVER

I don not understand the

question, sir or madam.

QUAIL

How did I get into this cab?

DRIVER

You stepped into it in the

normal manner, sir or madam.

15      INT. CORRIDOR OF QUAIL'S APARTMENT - DAY

1ST AGENT

Aren't you the man from Mars?

2ND AGENT

Don't give us a reason to

kill you.

QUAIL

Mr. Zimmer...Mr. Zimmer...

help me... they're...

16      INT. BASEMENT CAR PARK - DAY

QUAIL

Where are you taking me?

1ST AGENT

You told everyone at Rekall

about you trip to Mars.

Where you went, who you worked

for, what you did --

QUAIL

But I didn't... Are you telling

me... I did go to Mars?  I

don't remember?

1ST AGENT

You've remembered too much.

The Sphinx Project, for a

start....

QUAIL

(confused;

remembers only

fragments)

Sphinx?... No, no, I don't,

I... What about the people

at Rekall?  I don't recall

Rekall but you said if they

know what I did?  Why don't

you ask them?  They'll tell

you I didn't...

1ST AGENT

They've been taken care of.

QUAIL

What do you mean?

QUAIL

(continuing)

What are you going to do with

me?

1ST AGENT

Get in the car.

QUAIL

My God!  No!  You're going to

kill me!

1ST AGENT

No one's going to kill you if

[you do what you're told.]

We're visiting E.I.O. for some

new tests.  Now get in, or do

we start playing rough?

QUAIL

No!  It's not my fault!  You

can't do it!

QUAIL

(continuing)

Wait a minute, I remember --

1ST AGENT

What, Quail?  What do you

remember?

QUAIL

On Mars... they tried to kill

me... And....

18      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - EVENING

QUAIL

Did you know I've been to

Mars?

KIRSTEN

What!  This stupid obsess...

QUAIL

(interrupting)

I think I've been.  I vaguely

recall...

KIRSTEN

Doug, you've got to forget...

QUAIL

(interrupting)

Forget?  Remembering is the

problem I must've been

to one of those artificial

memory places...

KIRSTEN

Oh my God...

QUAIL

But something went wrong...

something about a real

memory... and then those

men...  tried to kill me.

KIRSTEN

What men?  Doug, you're crazy.

KIRSTEN

(continuing)

You're here now.  They didn't

kill you.

QUAIL

No.  That's what's so amazing.

I killed them.  I think...

KIRSTEN

Where?  Where are they?

KIRSTEN

(continuing)

Doug!  It's something they

put into your mind at the

memory place.  Fantasies.

That's their business.

KIRSTEN

(continuing)

You're a computer operator.

You're a bore.  You're a

wimp.  You're not a killer.

QUAIL

I'm involved somehow with

E.I.O.  It's true.  It's no

fantasy.

KIRSTEN

Doug, I want you to see a

doctor.  Now Alec and Shirley

Turnbull have a good man.  He

helped Alec through his

breakdown.

QUAIL

For fuck's sake, this is no

breakdown!

19      INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT

20      INT. LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT

QUAIL

My God!  Did you say I need a

psychiatrist?

KIRSTEN

(coolly)

I haven't seen you move that

fast since I've known you.

QUAIL

(outraged)

How could you do it?  After

eight years!

KIRSTEN

I'm not your wife, Quail.

QUAIL

Not my wife!  You are out of

your mind.

KIRSTEN

(indifferent;

nursing her

arm)

It's a false memory implant.

I never saw you before six

weeks ago.

QUAIL

Why are you lying like this?

KIRSTEN

No, Quail.  It's true.  You

work for E.I.O.  So do I.

QUAIL

(indicating their

surroundings)

But why all of this?

KIRSTEN

(shrugging)

We had to watchdog you...make

sure the erasure took.  A wife

seemed like a good idea.

QUAIL

But I remember it!  All of

it!... Us!

KIRSTEN

All implanted.

QUAIL

Our friends... my work...

eight years.

KIRSTEN

The job's real -- you've had

is six weeks -- since you got

back from Mars.

KIRSTEN

(continuing)

It's all a fabrication, Quail.

Everything you know.

QUAIL

This is crazy!  If all my

memories are false, who am

I?  What am I?  Jesus... it's

like I don't exist.

KIRSTEN

You exist, all right.

(very cold)

That's the problem.

QUAIL

Why did you try to kill me?

Why does E.I.O. want me dead?

KIRSTEN

They don't particularly.  That

was my idea.  This assignment was

boring me to death.  The

personality they gave you

wasn't too thrilling.

QUAIL

Well, what did I do on Mars

that they have to keep me from

telling?

KIRSTEN

I've no idea.  I just work

here.

QUAIL

All right... I'm leaving.

Don't try and follow me --

KIRSTEN

I don't have to follow you.

You can't get away from E.I.O.

Nobody does.

QUAIL

No wonder you got the role as

my bitchy wife -- type casting.

QUAIL

Here's ten thousand.  Forget

the ID.

QUAIL

(continuing)

I have a liaison with a

DESK CLERK

I understand, sir.  Nothing

Bit of fugitive flesh.  The

"Hauser, this is Hauser -- or

Your memory's been erased and

you've got a wet towel around

"The first thing you've got to

do is get rid of that bug in

your head."

CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)

The monitoring device is

located in your left maxillary

incision in your neck just

below the left ear, and

insert the wire up into the

sinus.  The head is

self-guiding.  Just shove.

COHAAGEN

(demands)

Anything?

SUPERVISOR

We're running every one of

his memory tapes for the past

fifteen years.  Nothing yet,

sir.

COHAAGEN

There must be something -- some

place he would go, some friend

he would run to.

RED-HEADED MAN

(to Cohaagen;

quietly)

They lost him.

COHAAGEN

Again?!

COHAAGEN

(continuing)

Are you sure the original

suppression took?

SUPERVISOR

Absolutely, sir.  He thinks

he's Quail, a computer...

COHAAGEN

(interrupting)

Then how do you explain what

he's doing?

SUPERVISOR

Just his instincts.  He was

well trained by E.I.O.... Maybe

the memory cap's fractured.

Portions of his prior identity

could be leaking through.

COHAAGEN

(very anxious)

He'll remember Mars?  The

Sphinx Project?

SUPERVISOR

Fragments.  Nothing more.

Nothing he could piece together.

I did advise terminating him,

rather than implanting an

identify alternative.

COHAAGEN

What do you think I am?  A

barbarian?  We're not living

in the twentieth century!

COHAAGEN

(continuing)

Hold it there.

42      INT. SPACE PORT - DAY

PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1

If he had to travel to Mars

with that bunch, I'd be sorry

for him.

PLAINCLOTHES MAN #2

We couldn't have missed him?

PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1

CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Those long gorges you see,

clearly are the legendary

canals of Mars....

CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)

(continuing)

Of course, they are not manmade

canals, but vast natural chasms

...many deeper and larger than

the Grand Canyon.  Though

utterly without moisture now,

scientists have determined

that they were formed by

massive flooding millions of

years ago.

Surface temperatures at the

Martian equator is minus

one-hundred and twenty degrees

Fortunately, this time of year

it's slightly more seasonable:

Sixty degrees, Fahrenheit,

outside the domes.

(beat)

Please remember, folks, that

outside the domes you'll need

to carry your own personal

oxygen supply at all times.

The atmosphere of Mars is

almost a vacuum.  Thank you

for flying with Interstellar

a pleasant one.

Not much, really.  Millions

you know...

QUAIL

Yeah.  Got destroyed in the

Arab wars... What about this

TOUR ORGANISER

(dismissive)

Not worth worrying about.

Mostly descendants of the

Oh, the usual one.  "Must

QUAIL

Who are you?

VOICE (O.S.)

My name is George Edgemar.

I work for Rekall, Incorporated.

QUAIL

(stunned;

incredulous)

Rekall??

VOICE (O.S.)

Yes.  It's difficult to

explain... Could you open the

door, please?  I'm not armed.

EDGEMAR

Hello, Mr. Quail.  May I come

in?  I won't be offended if

you prefer to keep the gun

you're holding trained on me.

QUAIL

All right... come in.

EDGEMAR

My card, Mr. Quail.

QUAIL

Okay -- so you're Doctor

George Edgemar of 'Rekall,

Inc.'  So?

EDGEMAR

As I said... this is going to

be very difficult -- for both

of us.

QUAIL

I'm listening.

EDGEMAR

Mr. Quail... I'm afraid you're

not really standing here at

this moment.

QUAIL

Sat that again.

EDGEMAR

I said, you're not really

here.  Neither am I.  We're

both in the Memory Studio --

in the offices of Rekall, Inc.

On Earth.

QUAIL

Are you trying to tell me that

this is all part of some...

artificially injected fantasy?

That I never really left Earth?

EDGEMAR

No, not quite.  We didn't give

you this.  You're creating it

yourself --

(pauses, choosing

his words)

Remember the option we offered

you?  Intelligence agent?

Something inside you liked

that idea, fastened on it.

What you're experiencing now

is a free-form delusion that

you yourself are fabricating.

QUAIL

What is this shit you're

giving me?

EDGEMAR

This is not -- shit, Mr. Quail.

It's the truth.

(beat)

I know it's very hard for you

to accept, but you're having

a schizophrenic reaction...

we can't snap you out of the

Narkadine.  You're in a world

of your own fantasy.

QUAIL

Then how the hell can you be

in my dream -- if you know it's

just a dream?

EDGEMAR

I've been artificially

implanted -- like the first

part of your fantasy.  I'm

actually monitoring your dream

at a psychoprobe console.

This is a last resort.  When

somebody gets stuck in their

own fantasy, we send in

someone after them.  A

specialist, like myself.

QUAIL

I don't believe a word you're

saying.

EDGEMAR

I was afraid you'd think that.

I'm sorry to have to do this,

but you really are stuck.

(calls out)

Doctor Noel, would you come in

now please?

MELINA

Yes, Mr. Quail, I'm afraid

it's all true.

MELINA

(continuing)

I tried to break through to

you earlier, but you just

molded me into your fantasy.

Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar

to get through to a client as

tough as you.

QUAIL

(wavering)

So what's supposed to happen

now?

EDGEMAR

Just do exactly as we tell

you.

QUAIL

(stares at him

coldly)

Somehow that doesn't appeal

to me.

MELINA

Please, Mr. Quail... try to

cooperate.  You're having a

schizophrenic embolism.

EDGEMAR

If we can't get you out now...

you may never come out of it.

Your wife calls every day --

QUAIL

If this is a fantasy, there'll

be no real consequences when

I pull this trigger.

EDGEMAR

But there will by consequences

inside your mind.  Consequences

that won't hurt me... but could

be fatal to you.

(beat)

If you shoot me, you'll wipe

me out of your fantasy -- I

can't come back again.  Because

to you, I'll be dead.  I can't

help you get back to reality.

You'll be stuck in permanent

psychosis.

EDGEMAR

You're going to lower the gun,

Mr. Quail.  You're going to

hand it to me --

EDGEMAR

You're going to do exactly

what I tell you --

more of them in the hall!

MELINA

No.  But we still believe in

So where did I fit into all

this?

MELINA

You - when you were Charles

Hauser with E.I.O -

infiltrated our group.  I

guess Cohaagen didn't trust

you any more when you and

I...

QUAIL

Yeah.  And I can't even

remember it.  We'll have to

arrange a return bout.

MELINA

...so he had your memory

wiped and fixed you up with

a new identity.

But - the Sphinx.  Why is

that stuck in my mind?  Why's

it so important?

I don't know.

BENNIE

Just an ole heap o' stone,

boss.

It's more than that, Bennie,

I know it's more.  Somehow

it's connected.

Tolerate my presumption, but

it does not tax my powers to

know that you are the most

outside is but a reflection

of the turmoil within you.

You have brought it to Mars

Indubitably.  There is only

small matter of a fee.

Naturally.

This is for our cause!

Income before ideals.  Shall

we say five-hundred-thousand

Five-hundred-thousand Martian

dollars, that's...

(think,

calculating the

exchange rate)

KUATO

Not Martian dollars, Mr.

Quail - Earth dollars.

Practices Commission might

be interested in this.

race eighteen millions years

built the on one Earth...

for the same purpose.

There are tunnels and ducts

everywhere, all powered by

BENNIE

You sure the little man

didn't fry your brain, Quail?

MELINA

(overlapping)

For what?  To do what?

QUAIL

To combine elements in the

Martian core and release

them as oxygen, hydrogen

and nitrogen.

BENNIE

That's air!

116B    EXT. DESERT - MORNING

QUAIL

That's right.  Air and water.

Terriforming will create a

permanent livable environment

for Mars.  No more pressurized

cities, no more containers in

the desert.  There'll be

rivers, vegetation - life -

the same as Earth.

MELINA

(baffled)

So why is Cohaagen shipping

everyone out?

QUAIL

Don't you see?!  From being

a pile of red dirt with

minerals, Mars is going to

change into  a chunk of

priceless real estate.

MELINA

And Cohaagen's going to own

it all!

QUAIL

Right!  He can start selling

it off to well-heeled investors

from Earth.  Beach condos, ski

resorts, you name it.

penetrate... out group.

you.

Ruin his little scheme by

terriforming ahead of

schedule - while the

I'm the only one who does.

Why do you think Cohaagen's

left me alone all this time?

118     EXT. DESERT - DAY

been programmed.  Some kind

of...force...shot into me.

MELINA

But Cohaagen wiped your

memory!!!

QUAIL

(smoothly)

Just a way of putting me on

ice.  He'd of reversed it

once the planet was evacuated.

BENNIE

Man!  This is real complicated.

Go over it again, real slow.

119     INT. VEHICLE - DAY

QUAIL

(ignoring Bennie's

aside)

What he hadn't counted on was

your effect on me.

MELINA

(smiling)

And all without the marvels

of modern science!

119A    EXT. DESERT - DAY

120     INT. VEHICLE - DAY

QUAIL

Bennie, don't stop now, take

it...

MELINA

You bastard.

BENNIE

Like I said.  It's a tough

planet.  I'm a baddie, not

a goodie.

QUAIL

I should have known, you

were just too helpful.

BENNIE

EIO Rule One, man.  Trust

Nobody.  Now you can do

your terriforming stuff

right when those space

shuttles are gone.

MELINA

But what about the Martian

people?  Out cause?  I thought

you believed in it.

BENNIE

Your cause?  That bunch of

dead beat radicals!  When I

hand in this little number...

(flicks his gun

in Quail's face)

...I'll get real estate rights

on the whole of Chryse

Planitia...

121     EXT. DESERT - DAY

122     INT. SAND MOLE - DAY

BENNIE

This makes Bennie a cut above

anyone else.

122AA   EXT. DESERT - DAY

122AB   INT/EXT. VEHICLE - DAY

122A    EXT. DESERT - DAY

122B    INT. VEHICLE - DAY

122C    EXT. DESERT - DAY

123     INT. SAND MOLE - MOVING - UNDERGROUND

QUAIL

(shouts over

engine noise)

Hope I've got this direction

right.

124     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM - DAY

COHAAGEN

The air supply is off under

the domes?

EMILE

Yes, sir.  In a couple of

hours it'll be all gone.

COHAAGEN

Any trouble with the rabble?

EMILE

Not much, sir.  A lot of

complaining.  But they're

all heading towards the

shuttle areas.

123     INT. TUNNEL BENEATH SPHINX

MELINA

We got in with this thing,

but we'll never get back out.

QUAIL

A shame.  Such a pleasant

trip.

126B    INT. MAIN DOWNSHAFT

QUAIL

(points down

shaft)

This is the main tap --

straight down to the core

of Mars.  When we trigger

the mechanism, fusion

reactors will detonate down

there -- four hundred miles

deep.

MELINA

Remind me not to slip.

QUAIL

The new elements will come

booming up through this

shaft -- and six thousand

others all around the

planet.

127     INT. CORRIDOR AT TOP OF SHAFT - LOWEST MANNED LEVEL (LEVEL ONE)

128     ON THE WALL OF THE SHAFT

129     INT. TOP OF SHAFT - LOWEST MANNED LEVEL (LEVEL ONE)

GUARD LEADER

(to two of his

men)

Stay in contact.  I want to

hear from this checkpoint

every four minutes.

GUARD #1

Did you hear something?

GUARD #2

No.  Where?

GUARD #1

Over there.

QUAIL'S VOICE (O.S.)

(from behind the

guards)

I'm not there, boys.  I'm

here.

GUARD #1

(to Guard #2)

Watch him.  He was EIO trained.

They're all full of tricks.

GUARD #2

Yeah?  Like...who was that

guy? -- Fred Bond??

(to Quail)

Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em

up.

GUARD #1

A hologram!

130     INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL ONE

MELINA

(running)

Where'd you get that little

trick?

QUAIL

(running)

Mail-order company.  It's a

great one for fooling the

wife.

131     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN)

COHAAGEN

How the hell did they get in?

SECURITY AIDE

Up the fusion core.

COHAAGEN

Up the fusion core??

SECURITY AIDE

(studies monitor

more carefully)

They're on Level One.

COHAAGEN

Seal all upper levels.

133     INT. LEVEL ONE CORRIDOR

QUAIL

(indicates

weapons)

Know how to use one of these?

134     INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS, CATWALKS, STAIRS

QUAIL

Catch!

MELINA

Great stuff, but how do we

get up?

135     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN)

COHAAGEN

Forget them.  We'll pick up

Quail once the shuttles have

left for Earth.

137     INT. CORRIDOR

QUAIL

If you're afraid of the

heights, you better get

over it real quick.

140     EXT. SPHINX'S FACE - DAY

141     INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

EMILE

If Quail's the only one who

can operate all this...

(gestures toward

Sphinx's controls)

...then he can call all the

shots.

COHAAGEN

We'll tell him the computer's

worked out the operational

details so we don't really

need him.  We're just doing

him a favor.

EMILE

And if that doesn't work?

COHAAGEN

We offer him rewards.

EMILE

What if that doesn't work?

COHAAGEN

We'll torture him.  You don't

think I got this far by being

a nice guy?

142     EXT. SPHINX'S FACE - DAY

142A    INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

OPERATOR

First of the shuttles ready

for departure, sir.  Two

minute countdown.

142B    EXT. SPHINX - DAY

143     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM

COHAAGEN

Seal the breach!  Repressurize!

MELINA

Those shuttles are starting up

any minute.  If you know how

to work this thing, you better

do it now.

QUAIL

Yes...

MELINA

Don't you know how?

QUAIL

Yes... there's a vital

connection missing...

QUAIL

(continuing)

...me...

COHAAGEN

Wait!

MELINA

Don't wait!

COHAAGEN

If you activate the mechanism

you'll die...there were

glimpses of it in your

memory.

QUAIL

Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a

long tunnel, a brilliant

white light, hands reaching

for me...

COHAAGEN

(assured)

That's your death.  That's

what it looks like.  That's

what is always looks like.

MELINA

(looking toward

space shuttles

on video screens)

Charles - for Mars's sake....

COHAAGEN

It's not too late.  Join us

again.  U've a lot to offer.

A whole world.

QUAIL

You don't deserve a new world,

you and people like you made

too big a mess of the old one.

Time someone else had a

chance.

144     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL

145     EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY

QUAIL

Am I dying?

MASKED MINER

I won't lie to you, pal.

You are.

MINER (from Melina's bar)

I'd say in about forty years...

(he and others

help Quail to

his feet)

...come on, we've gotta get

to the Space Port.  That

Intergalactic Napoleon's

switched off the air.

2ND MINER

Shippin' us all out.  Mars

is finished.

MELINA

It's happening.

MINER

What is it?

QUAIL

That's just the start.  Next

there'll be rain and growth

and ... life.

QUAIL

(continuing)

Rekall could never have come

up with anything like this.

THE END
