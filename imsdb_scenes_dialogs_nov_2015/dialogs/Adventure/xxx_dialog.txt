Third Draft

STERLING

I hate to drop in unexpectedly.

STERLING

Time for a slow boat to China.

STERLING

Oh bloody hell!

CUT TO:

SAM TANNICK

Come.

GIBBONS

Evening, Sam.

SAM TANNICK

What do you have?

GIBBONS

Not a whole helluva lot. His final

transmission was mangled. About

something or someone called "Ahab".

Whatever it is, it cost him his life.

SAM TANNICK

He was the best there was. That makes

three agents lost.

GIBBONS

They're ruthless and they have a lot

of firepower. It's only a matter of

time before they figure out how to

deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna

have a catastrophe on our hands.

SAM TANNICK

Silent Night in the hands of a bunch

of impertinent cowboys

GIBBONS

We're gonna have to step in, Sam.

Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown

in a field of cactus. Let me take

care of it.

SAM TANNICK

How will you fix it?

GIBBONS

I'll go in with a team. But first

I'm going to need some intel. I'll

have to put someone inside, someone

new, someone they won't see coming.

One of their own.

SAM TANNICK

So you'll dredge the bottom again.

You've done that before. The results

were... uneven.

GIBBONS

You wanna find out about rats, ask a

rat. I've had my people put together

a talent pool. I downloaded it to

your desktop.

GIBBONS

The usual prospects. Convicts,

contract killers, murde...

SAM TANNICK

The scum of the Earth.

GIBBONS

But programmable. And expendable.

SAM TANNICK

I've seen enough. Turn it off.

SAM TANNICK

They're degenerates. There's not a

man in there that would give a damn

if the Chinese took over.

GIBBONS

That's exactly why we need them.

SAM TANNICK

Get these "scum", Mr. Gibbons, bring

them in. Test them. Train them. Find

your man.

CUT TO:

SECURITY GUARD

Crump... I'm sorry, no one by that

name.

SECURITY GUARD

Hey! You can't go up there!

SECURITY GUARD

We've got an intruder in the express

elevator!

SLAM TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

XANDER

Sky, you there? Start packin' cause

we are out of here!

XANDER

Did I promise you a fat vacation or

what? Get ready to get down in

paradise.

XANDER

Hey, you don't need all this just to

go on vacation. Unless this ain't

for going on vacation...

SKY

I'm through, Xander.

XANDER

I can see that. Why?

SKY

You run around with maniacs jumping

motorcycles in the desert, you break

36 bones crashing wave runners and

snowboarding off cliffs, all with no

health insurance... It's insane, I

can't take it anymore.

XANDER

I'm having fun, what's the problem?

SKY

You have all this talent, and you

waste it. You won't take a single

endorsement deal. Meanwhile those

other guys have their own video games!

But no, you've got too much

"integrity" for that.

XANDER

I don't wanna go mersh, you know

that. But hey, if this is about

money...

XANDER

I got an advance on the next bootleg.

Let's get out of here, just you and

me. We'll chill out in Bora Bora for

a couple months.

SKY

French Polynesia? This wouldn't last

us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you

know how expensive it is down there?

XANDER

Alright, so I'll get more.

SKY

It's not about the money, X! You

never plan for anything. I can't

live like that anymore, I need some

stability.

XANDER

Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd

better give you your surprise now.

SKY

What...?

XANDER

I was gonna wait till the islands,

but...

SKY

You're serious?

XANDER

Of course I'm serious. I bought it,

didn't I?

SKY

(shakes her head)

This is so typical. I can't believe

you. I've barely seen you for the

last three weeks and now this? Are

you out of your mind?

XANDER

I don't know. I thought this is what

you wanted. You want stability, here

it is.

SKY

You can't just propose to me out of

nowhere. You think that's going to

solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It

was a kick for a while, but it's

over. You're just not going anywhere.

XANDER

You're not exactly "going anywhere"

yourself.

SKY

You're wrong about that. I'm heading

out that door right now.

XANDER

She had nothing to do with the tower

jump. She's nobody. I just met her

last night. Tell them.

(with meaning)

I hardly know you.

SKY

Keep the ring. It looks better on

you anyways.

XANDER

God, I hate cops. What's the charges

this time?

XANDER

(groggy)

You... pussies...

XANDER

What the hell?

XANDER

Hey. Where am I? How did I get here?

WAITRESS

I don't know, you wandered in ten

minutes ago and put your head down.

I told you we were closing.

WAITRESS

Want some coffee?

XANDER

Huh?

XANDER

You alright?

WAITRESS

(smiles)

Fine, just fine. Come on and sit.

I'll get you something to eat.

XANDER

Yeah, sure.

XANDER

What?

TRUCKER

I said, you got a problem, boy?

XANDER

Problem? No, no problem. You go right

ahead.

TRUCKER

With what? I said, go right on ahead

with what?

XANDER

Whatever, dude.

TRUCKER

Alright, nobody make a move!

(to Xander)

Shoulda walked away when you had the

chance, dumb shit.

SALESMAN

Forget him, Buck, let's just do it.

TRUCKER

Shut up!

(in Xander's face)

You keep still or I'm gonna make

damn sure you stop breathing today.

Got that?

XANDER

(shrugs)

Alright, "Buck", whatever you say.

TRUCKER

Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty

that register! Couldn't just let him

leave, could ya! You know what I'm

gonna do to ya for that? Huh? Do

ya?!

XANDER

Better shoot me quick.

XANDER

Too late!

XANDER

Alright, bitch, what's going on?

XANDER

Talk! What's the game? Who are you

people?

XANDER

Who the hell are you?

GIBBONS

The name's Gibbons. You were saying?

XANDER

What is this place?

GIBBONS

Looks like a diner.

XANDER

Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the

problem is. I wake up drugged to

find what? You've got a "salesman"

over here reading a three week old

newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a

"trucker", who happens to be packing

a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped

that something is going down when

she passes me a note. How's that for

twisted logic? How did she know there

was trouble unless they pulled the

guns before I "walked" in? And if

that's true, why'd they stop and

wait until I woke up to gaffle the

money? Then I notice how beefy they

both are. Hell, even the waitress is

cut. All three of them look like

they went through the same training

program. Ergo they ain't strangers

and this isn't what it seems. That's

how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round

off even if I gave him all day. Why?

XANDER

Cuz there's nothing but blanks in

these guns. And no offense, but their

performances were terrible.

GIBBONS

Not bad. Not bad at all. Have a seat.

GIBBONS

Most guys we ran through this either

took off or helped them rob the place.

I expected you to do the same.

XANDER

That shows me already that you don't

have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?

GIBBONS

Whether you thought this was for

real or not, you jumped in and helped

the waitress on instinct. That tells

me something about your character.

XANDER

Good for you. Now why don't you stop

wasting my time and tell me what you

want. You didn't go through all this

for my benefit.

GIBBONS

It's your lucky day. You just might

get the chance to pay back our

wonderful country for all the freedom

you enjoy.

XANDER

A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else

would have this kind of budget? Now

you're gonna hit me with the sales

pitch.

GIBBONS

Alright, Cage, you've got me. This

is one of those moments. "Many are

called, few are chosen", that kind

of thing. Your government needs you.

Are you up for the challenge?

XANDER

..If you're trolling around for narcs,

man, have you got the wrong guy.

GIBBONS

Why is that?

XANDER

Look at me, dude, do I look like a

fan of law enforcement? Forget the

tests, you shoulda just asked me. I

woulda saved you a lot of trouble.

GIBBONS

Oh I don't know, I think the tests

work pretty well. Sometimes they

give me answers you wouldn't admit

to in a million years.

XANDER

Are we done now? You've got nothing

on me. So if you ain't booking me,

I'm walking.

GIBBONS

You've got this wrong. You're not

under arrest, you've been abducted.

And until I say different, you belong

to me.

XANDER

Is that a fact?

GIBBONS

Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling

about you from the start, Cage. It's

nausea.

XANDER

(smiles)

You know what I hate? Any scumbag

with a clean shirt and a bad haircut

can get one of those tin stars and

suddenly they think they're God.

GIBBONS

(smiles)

You know what I hate? It's always

the assholes that pass the tests.

XANDER

You bastards love to see me sleep.

CUT TO BLACK:

VIRG

What's so damn funny?

XANDER

Been to any good diners lately?

T.J.

We must be the final "candidates".

XANDER

Nobody told me this was a costume

party.

T.J.

I've worked with guys like this

before. Black Ops. Serious government

spooks.

VIRG

Heads up, man. What's this thing on

my back?

XANDER

A parachute. This does not argue

well.

VIRG

This is bullshit! Hey!

XANDER

I get the picture.

VIRG

Jee-zus, man! What the hell now?

Another damn test?

T.J.

We should head for those trees.

XANDER

Don't look at me, brother. It's every

man for himself.

XANDER

You gotta be kidding me.

XANDER

You boys are too good for me. Guess

I failed this one, huh?

XANDER

So much for "every man for himself".

Nice to see you again, fellas.

T.J.

They really went all out on this

one. This is a pretty gnarly setup.

VIRG

Check the table in the corner.

XANDER

This oughta be good.

XANDER

This must be el jefe. How's it goin'

jefe? Some weather we're havin'.

XANDER

What's on the menu tonight? The old

blowtorch-to-the-family jewels

routine, I'll bet. Hey, you want

roasted nuts, let's break out the

Planters.

JEFE

Do you know what we do with people

come round here? You know what we do

with people come in our business?

JEFE

We cut the Achilles tendon. Your

feet flop around like a marionette.

You ain't walkin' nowhere no more.

Sound good, tough guy? Or maybe

instead you wanna tell me something.

JEFE

Whatchu doing here?

XANDER

Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.

JEFE

That's some accident, hombre. You

accidentally fall out of a plane in

the middle of the night and land up

in my back yard.

JEFE

We seen this kind of parachutes

before, you know. U.S. Army. You got

some friends here, jump out with you

guys?

XANDER

We're anti-social. We don't have any

friends.

JEFE

No friends, huh? That's funny, I

don't know no U.S. Army that comes

without no friends. That's cuz U.S.

Army is pussies. They always come

with the five hundred guys and the

helicopters and the see-in-the-dark

glasses. So don't you tell me you

all alone out here, my friend. You

bullshitting the wrong guy.

XANDER

Who's writing this dude's dialogue?

VIRG

He's a pretty good actor, though.

T.J.

Makes the diner look like a sixth

grade play. He's even got them crazy

eyes.

JEFE

You ain't begun to see crazy yet,

amigo.

XANDER

We're on to the game, ese. You got

the fake blood splattered all over

the walls, you got your torture

tools... It's all very cute. But

come on, let's quit while you're

ahead. I'm only trying to save you a

beatin'.

JEFE

You saving me? You talking pretty

tough for a guy got himself chained

to the ceiling.

XANDER

(shrugs)

Alright. You wanna eat through a

tube, be my guest.

JEFE

Now you're gonna make me enjoy this,

funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the

whole foot off. Whatchu think of

that?

JEFE

What's that, eh? I thought you didn't

have no friends!

XANDER

Keys. You got 'em?

XANDER

Hand 'em to me.

XANDER

I hope you're getting paid extra for

this.

T.J.

I'm hit! I'm hit!

VIRG

They're shooting for real! This is

all real.

XANDER

Aw shit.

XANDER

Help me with this guy.

VIRG

It's like you said, every man for

himself.

XANDER

That only works if you're a man!

XANDER

You alright?

T.J.

I used to be a SEAL, it's not the

first time I've been shot. Thanks,

man.

XANDER

Keep your head down, I'll be right

back. I'm gonna steal us some wheels.

VIRG

They're all over the place! What the

hell's going on?

XANDER

Looks like we're in the middle of

the drug war.

XANDER

Alright Mr. free-for-all, you go

that way, I'm gonna go this way.

They can't follow us both.

XANDER

Go!

XANDER

Shit!

XANDER

I'm gonna need to hit the trees after

a night like this.

XANDER

Nice of you to draw me a bath. Is it

Saturday already?

GIBBONS

Congratulations, you've just graduated

at the head of your class.

XANDER

You're a cold piece of work. You

almost got three people killed out

there.

GIBBONS

Good thing you were there to save

the day. Come walk with me.

GIBBONS

You've really got me confused, Cage.

On the one hand you showed leadership,

courage under fire, a willingness to

protect men you hardly knew... and

on the other you have an arrest record

that pegs you as near sociopathic.

Help me out here. I'm not following

your evolution.

XANDER

You want the cheap backstory? The

runaway mom, the suicide dad and the

foster homes? Gimme a break. You're

not interested in my past, you're

interested in my future as some kind

of spy.

GIBBONS

You're perceptive too. I forgot to

add that to the list of surprises.

I'm with the National Security Agency.

And unlikely as it may sound, I need

your help.

XANDER

I'm not interested. I've already got

a job.

GIBBONS

You're an adrenaline junkie with one

foot in the penitentiary. You risk

your ass building a daredevil myth

that means nothing and you're not

getting any younger.

XANDER

I plan on getting a lot older. And

playing spy games sounds like a quick

way to get yourself dead.

GIBBONS

That's too bad. I thought a guy like

you would appreciate the challenge.

XANDER

What's this? You're gonna try to

scare me now?

GIBBONS

Do you know the reason why I try to

recruit guys like you? There's no

risk.

GIBBONS

There's nobody back home who's gonna

ask questions if you just... disappear

for a while.

XANDER

Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So

what's the deal? What do you need me

for?

GIBBONS

There's some folks I want to keep

tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized.

Your kind of people.

XANDER

What do I get out of it?

GIBBONS

If you find out what I want to know,

and if I'm able to successfully use

that information, you get to go back

to your degenerate little life. If

not, you take a bath.

XANDER

You're one sick bastard. A sadist

with a badge looking to rope me in

to a suicide mission. I think no

matter which way I go I'm likely to

wind up face down on a sheet of

plastic. So here's my answer: kiss

my ass, Hop-along.

XANDER

Not bad for a gimp.

GIBBONS

What's with that "X" on the back of

your head? Does that mean you're

"extreme"? I've got some news for

you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser.

So maybe you should tattoo another

couple of X's on your head.

XANDER

I'll take that under advisement.

Maybe I can be like you and lose a

leg for the old Stars and Bars. I

bet the flag's a great comfort every

time you need help climbing stairs.

GIBBONS

One twitch and my finger and thumb

will meet inside your esophagus.

Believe me, Mr. X, I've put foot to

ass for my country on many occasions

and I don't feel the urge to stop

just yet. So think carefully before

you tell me: Is "kiss my ass, Hop-

along" your final answer?

XANDER

(choking)

No.

GIBBONS

I thought you might see it my way.

GIBBONS

Where you going, X? I said where you

going?

XANDER

You tell me.

XANDER

There better be a movie on this Goddam

flight.

XANDER

How about a pedicure as long as you're

down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?

GIBBONS

Wherever you go on the planet, I'll

find you. There's no quitting. If

you try to take it off, a ring of

needles will inject enough curare

into your bloodstream to kill you

before you hit the ground. Is all

that clear?

XANDER

Yeah, I spy or I die.

NERDY AGENT

This is your communicator. You'll

identify yourself by a call sign.

From here on out you're Bulldog Omega

5.

XANDER

You must stay up late to come up

with shit like that.

GIBBONS

I expect you to call in regularly

with progress reports.

XANDER

Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog

Omega 5.

AGENT

Uh... Call signs derive from the

parameters of the mission.

GIBBONS

If he doesn't like it, we can make

an exception just this once. We'll

call him "Triple X".

XANDER

Up yours.

GIBBONS

Crude and defiant as always, Triple

X. It fits so well because you're

obscene.

XANDER

Is that all?

GIBBONS

Just remember, I'll be watching.

XANDER

I've got something for you to chew

on. Next time you send someone to

save the world, make sure they like

the planet the way it is.

KID

What game is that?

XANDER

Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes?

They're called "Anarchy 99", they're

the bad guy bosses.

KID

Do they have any special powers? The

bosses always have special powers.

XANDER

You wanna check it out? Come here.

XANDER

First we've got Anders, the psycho

looking biker. In charge of

transportation and smuggling. Controls

every trucking union in Eastern

Europe. Don't look too clean, either.

XANDER

Next we got a Siberian redneck,

Viktor. Into snowmobiles and

snowboarding. So naturally, he covers

prostitution and the drug trade.

KID

Naturally.

KID

This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.

XANDER

Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a

bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed

kills in Chechnya, they called him

the "Finger of God". Assassination

and weapons.

KID

Who's the hottie?

XANDER

You like her, huh? Petra. She runs

their finances, money laundering,

computers. Joined the gang after

spending some time as the girlfriend

of this dude, Yorgi Azar Zimin. Capo

of Anarchy 99.

XANDER

Yorgi masterminded the take-over of

three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called

it "blood week". He combined all of

their global enterprises into one

huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.

KID

(skeptically)

"Anarchy" 99"?

XANDER

What are you gonna do? They're Euro-

trash.

KID

What weapons do you have?

XANDER

Just about anything I want, it looks

like. This is gonna be tough, though.

There's no way to save this game. I

gotta get it right the first time

through.

KID

What do you get if you finish?

XANDER

Nothing, really. My guy is just doing

it to stay alive.

KID

Oh. I bet by the end he gets something

out of it.

XANDER

Like what?

KID

He gets to be the hero.

DISSOLVE TO:

XANDER

This is bullshit, man, I wanna see

some ID.

XANDER

You're both named Ivan? That's gotta

be confusing on Valentine's Day. So

where we headed? Fellas, I said where

we headed?

(beat)

Yeah, whatever.

XANDER

James Bond never had to put up with

this shit.

SLOVO

Sit down.

XANDER

I've been on a plane for twelve hours,

I think I'll stand.

SLOVO

My name is Slovo, Czech secret police.

When you are here you are under my

jurisdiction, you take my orders,

you do what I say. If you become any

kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot

you.

XANDER

Here we go again.

SLOVO

You're here because your government

is putting pressure on my government.

This is an internal affair, a Czech

affair, that you are interfering

with. I will warn you once: Don't

shit in my lawn. Get whatever

information your government seeks

and get our.

XANDER

First of all, you should kill whoever

sold you that suit. Two, I don't

wanna be here either, so just step

off. Three, if you had the authority

to shoot me you would've done it by

now, so just ease up on the machismo,

bitch. Now that we've got that sorted

out, I'm gonna get some rest.

SLOVO

Be ready in three hours.

XANDER

Nice hops.

SLOVO

The corner. Anarchy 99.

SLOVO

See the one with the funny colored

hair? Crazy bitch stabbed one of my

men in the knee-cap. There they are,

American. The low-rent millionaire

criminals. And you thought only your

country had white trash. American?

SLOVO

Oh no!

SLOVO

Jesus Christ!

SLOVO

(horrified)

What the hell...?

XANDER

That's the guy.

YORGI

This pizda? Never seen him before.

XANDER

(to Slovo)

Who you workin' for? What do you do

for a living, dickhead?

SLOVO

Uh... I am... I work in insurance.

SLOVO

(panicked whisper)

What the hell are you doing?

XANDER

Look what we have here. Czech 5-0 on

the mack.

YORGI

Cops. Like a plague. No matter how

many you pay there's always another

with his hand out. How did you pick

him out?

XANDER

He flashed his badge to half the bar

when he bought his drink.

YORGI

I appreciate you bringing this to

our attention. Whatever you want,

the rest of the night, consider it

on the house.

XANDER

Thanks, but I'm here on business. I

heard you're the G around here. I'm

looking for some cars, expensive

ones. A lot of them.

YORGI

Sorry, man, don't know what you're

talking about.

XANDER

I'm talking about the sports cars

that disappear off the docks in Genoa

and wind up here. If you don't know

about 'em, who does?

XANDER

I guess I heard wrong.

YORGI

Xander Cage!

ANDERS

The X man! We seen your bootleg

videos!

VIKTOR

You sick! You sick crazy on a board,

on a bike! Everything!

YORGI

This is insane, man. Xander Cage in

Prague. Come on, sit. Sit with us.

YORGI

I remember that one where you jump

the motorcycle over the freeway at

rush hour.

XANDER

When else are you gonna do it?

VIKTOR

You almost died on that one.

XANDER

Cops arrested me while I was still

in surgery. Did two months.

YORGI

We seen all your shit! So you want

cars? We get whatever cars you need.

What are you looking for?

XANDER

Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end

pasta rockets. Ten to start.

ANDERS

Ten! No problem! We do that no

problem!

PETRA

Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're

talking a lousy million five U.S.

XANDER

I have Japanese buyers who are looking

to move a fleet, if you have the

quality of merchandise they're after.

And it's a mil two, max.

PETRA

Do you know what a wire transfer is?

XANDER

Is she for real? Honey, maybe you

should quiet down and let the grownups

have a conversation.

PETRA

My goodness, a word with four

syllables. I should get some ice

before your brain gets too hot.

XANDER

Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.

PETRA

(smiles)

So cute. He shows up for a battle of

wits with a mental butter knife.

YORGI

(laughing)

Don't look at me, X, she handles all

the details.

XANDER

It'll work faster if I have an account

number.

PETRA

You'll have forty-eight hours to

complete the transfer. Don't waste

our time.

XANDER

Wouldn't dream of it. I'm even gonna

throw in a few extra bucks to send

you to charm school.

YORGI

Alright, now that business is

finished, we party! Bitches, come!

We have a drink and toast the deal!

XANDER

I believe I can hang with you fellas

for a while.

XANDER

(into phone)

I guess you got my E-mail. I set up

a purchase. Ten cars.

GIBBONS

If you're trying to push my buttons,

you're on the right track. Don't

make me question my own judgment, X.

XANDER

Buddy, you sent me here to get close

to their organization, that costs

money.

GIBBONS

One point two million dollars? I did

not authorize you to spend one point

two million dollars!

XANDER

I'm already on a first name basis

with these dudes, I got a deal set

up, you want me to hammer it or not?

GIBBONS

We're not after car thieves here.

XANDER

What the hell am I after? You're

telling me dick.

GIBBONS

That information is classified. You're

there to gather information on their

operations, period.

XANDER

Call me crazy, but I thought hooking

up a million dollar deal was a great

way to get on their good side. What

else? You gonna hassle me about the

weapons and spy stuff too?

GIBBONS

My friend, if you're planning on

crossing me...

XANDER

I know, poison needles in my shins.

You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.

SAM TANNICK

Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry

Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this

time.

GIBBONS

I think we should send him whatever

he wants.

SAM TANNICK

You what? A wire transfer of this

size?

GIBBONS

If it means getting Silent Night

back, absolutely.

SAM TANNICK

You're talking about a very expensive

risk here.

GIBBONS

He's gotten closer in 24 hours than

all of the other operatives combined.

He got us an account number to boot.

Now even if he's just dumb and lucky,

I say we back his play.

(beat)

I put him out there, Sam. If he

doesn't come up with the money,

they'll kill him. I can't let that

happen.

SAM TANNICK

Why not? You were going to throw him

in a tub full of acid, weren't you?

SAM TANNICK

Alright, do what you want. But keep

the screws on him. He's a wild card.

That could be either good or bad.

GIBBONS

So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I

can deal with that.

CUT TO:

SLOVO

Your government must know something

we don't.

SHAVERS

Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle-

trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent

Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking

for what's his name. Three X' s.

XANDER

That's would be me.

SHAVERS

Figures. You got someplace we can

spread out my gear or what? I mean

today.

SLOVO

I'll leave you two alone to talk.

XANDER

Yeah, thanks a lot.

SHAVERS

Back off, just go away you klutz.

Alright, here's the story. The items

in these cases belong to me. I

designed them, built them, and was

going to use them in the field myself

until you showed up.

XANDER

I stole your beat, huh? Guess you

forgot to brown-nose the right people.

SHAVERS

Is that supposed to be funny? I'm

not laughing. I've worked for ten

years to get my shot at being a field

agent, funny boy. And ar the last

minute I get bumped by you, some

reject from the Ozzfest.

XANDER

Why don't you show me some gear before

you get hurt.

SHAVERS

Listen to you. Right away, sir,

anything you say, sir.

XANDER

What is all this? I didn't even order

some of this stuff.

SHAVERS

You're gonna need it, rookie, trust

me.

SHAVERS

An all-terrain mobile video monitoring

system for surveillance. I call it

the "Roach Cam". See the little camera

it's got for a head?

XANDER

Kinda looks like you.

SHAVERS

"Terminator" climbing claws.

SHAVERS

Miniature power cams set in on

contact, giving you a sure grip on

any surface.

XANDER

They come in any other styles or

colors?

SHAVERS

This is your standard dart gun.

XANDER

That one I'm real familiar with.

SHAVERS

You've got your chromium knock-out

dart, microphone listening dart,

explosive dart, even one with a

splatter blood packet, whatever you

need. They also come in a special

9mm casing for use with your service

pistol.

SHAVERS

Multi-view binoculars. Nine different

enhanced vision modes, plus a digital

camera.

SHAVERS

Infrared, starlight... Even a special

"penetrator" mode to see through

walls, curtains, almost anything...

XANDER

I think I'll hang on to these.

SHAVERS

Think again, that's government

property. You have to sign for

everything. I've got one more that

wasn't on your list.

XANDER

From the Beastie Boys collection?

SHAVERS

It's a stakeout suit. It's got food,

water, recording gear, anything you

need for covert spying. It's all-

weather, fire retardant, and if you

give this buckle a sharp pull, the

whole outfit deploys into a parachute.

XANDER

You're joking, right?

SHAVERS

Now that I've given you the overview,

we're going to spend the next couple

hours going into extensive operational

detail.

XANDER

I thought that was in detail.

ANDERS

So what you think? Beautiful!

YORGI

Has it arrived yet?

PETRA

Nothing. He had two days.

YORGI

Perhaps he is not all he says he is.

XANDER

Very nice. I'm impressed.

YORGI

I'm somewhat less so. We seem to

have a bit of a problem...

XANDER

I had to inspect the merchandise

first.

YORGI

Of course.

XANDER

What's this?

YORGI

This is a gift. From me to you.

YORGI

It's a little nothing, you take it.

YORGI

Come on, get in.

XANDER

You're alright, Yorgi.

SLOVO

Smile, bychara.

KIRILL

Yorgi!

YORGI

What in the hell...?

YORGI

What's going on, my friend?

XANDER

You tell me! You got a sniper up

there or what?

YORGI

He's not with us, Xander. He must be

with you.

XANDER

(he cocks the hammer)

Bullshit! You get your boy off that

roof or I swear to God I'm gonna

give you another hole to breathe out

of.

YORGI

Get him! Find out who he is!

XANDER

I've got him. Buckle up.

YORGI

That's the cop from the club!

YORGI

What are you doing? Get in the car!

YORGI

I don't believe it! You can't shoot

a cop in the middle of the street!

XANDER

(grim)

Had to do what I had to do.

YORGI

You say you get a million, you get

the million. Some cop gives us shit,

he's dead. Jesus Christ, man, you're

hard-core!

IVAN 1

It's sweet.

YORGI

Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy

99!

XANDER

What's "Anarchy 99"?

YORGI

It's all this craziness! It's what

we've been living since 99, when we

left the Army. One of our brothers

died in Grozny and we said the hell

with this shit. What for? He dies

for what? Politics? Who's politics?

Not ours.

XANDER

You wanna see my politics?

XANDER

Screw the world. If I'm gonna die

for something, it better be bitches

and money.

YORGI

That's what I'm talking about, man!

That's why Anarchy 99 was born.

YORGI

To us it means no walls, no speed

limits, no jails. It's everybody

does what he wants. People think

democracy is freedom but they don't

have a clue. There's an old punk

song. It says: "America stands for

freedom, but if you think you're

free..."

XANDER

"...try walking into a deli and

urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy

Burger' by the Vandals.

YORGI

You got it, man. It's stupid but

it's true. True freedom is when you

do whatever you want anytime you

want. That's when you know you're

living, man.

XANDER

How you gonna do that with government

and rules everywhere?

YORGI

Easy. You get enough money that you

grow an ass big enough for the whole

world to kiss.

YORGI

You hang with us, buddy, taste some

freedom! Petra! Dance with this guy!

XANDER

This is great, dancing with the back

of your head.

XANDER

If you got a problem with me, why

are we dancing?

PETRA

Yorgi asked me to.

XANDER

You do everything Yorgi says?

PETRA

Go to hell.

XANDER

It's gonna be like that, huh? You

got all bent out of shape as soon as

he started dancing with someone else.

Why's that?

PETRA

Mind your business.

XANDER

Did you guys used to date? That's

it, right? He broke your heart and

you're still soft on him. That's

funny, it don't seem to fit with a

tough broad like you.

XANDER

Where are you going?

PETRA

Why are you still hanging around?

Your business is finished, you should

go home.

XANDER

I was invited. What's your story?

PETRA

I don't know who you are or where

you come from, but I don't like you.

You ask too many questions.

XANDER

Come on, don't front like that. You'll

put a guy right off you.

PETRA

Don't even bother, X man, I'm not

your type.

XANDER

That right? Why's that?

PETRA

My chest is too small and my brain

is too big.

YORGI

Xander, check it out! The revolution

begins!

YORGI

Let's get some air, man.

XANDER

You got a great set-up here Yorgi.

You really know how to live.

YORGI

It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's

been good to me.

XANDER

I've been here before, when I was a

kid. My old man was in the service,

we used to live on the Army base in

Hamburg.

YORGI

You, an Army brat? I don't see that

one at all. Did you join the service

as well?

XANDER

Hell no. My dad was a straight up

tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this

general off and got himself

dishonorably discharged. Had a court

martial and everything. The charges

were total bullshit, so he was sure

he'd get his name cleared, but it

didn't happen.

YORGI

Connections and politics, it's the

same everywhere.

XANDER

My old man, he bought into the system,

and it screwed him. So he swallowed

a bullet. Me, I don't believe in

nothing I can't see and touch.

YORGI

Next week these idiots are having a

peace conference here. What the hell

are they going to talk about? It's

the system itself that causes all

the world's problems. You're okay,

buddy. Come on, it's getting early.

YORGI

This way, girls, let's go!

VIKTOR

Diversified global operations. The

sun never sets on our empire.

YORGI

(sorting through

messages)

Not bad, yes? The original owners,

they just one day decide to move

out.

PETRA

Yeb vas, z'opa. Shut up!

YORGI

I've got meetings this afternoon,

I've got to get some sleep. Just

pick a girl.

XANDER

That's alright, I'm kinda tired.

YORGI

You want to insult me? This is my

hospitality. Pick one.

YORGI

Good, now find a room to crash in.

XANDER

You gonna tuck us in?

XANDER

Listen, no offense, but I'm not in

the market right now, okay? You can

stay here, but let's not --

XANDER

You don't understand a word I'm

saying, do you?

XANDER

Stupid, right? That's what I was

trying to tell you. I just got out

of this heavy thing...

XANDER

The things I have to do for my

country.

DISSOLVE TO:

PETRA

What are you doing?

XANDER

Looking for a phone book. I want to

call a cab. Unless you wanna give me

a ride?

PETRA

Who are you?

XANDER

We hung out last night, remember?

PETRA

I also remember you drove your car

here. Who are you really? Make no

mistake, I will shoot you and not

feel bad about it. Who are you working

for?

XANDER

Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude

trying to make a buck.

PETRA

Bullshit. I see you look at

everything, study everything, ask

questions. I know exactly what you're

doing. Empty your pockets.

XANDER

You've got to relax, baby, you're

paranoid.

XANDER

Hey, you're good.

PETRA

Maybe we should start again, yes? I

know so little about you, except

that you're not what you say you

are.

XANDER

That makes two of us then, sweetheart,

because I ain't buying your bullshit

either. You're not like them, I can

see it in your eyes. So you tell me,

who's bullshitting who?

YORGI

Something bothers me about you, Mr.

Xander Cage...

YORGI

Get Kirill. Now!

KIRILL

What's the problem?

YORGI

I'm inside the police mainframe. Do

you see anything?

KIRILL

What?

YORGI

I've searched their E-mail. No funeral

announcement, no obituary, no call-

to-arms. Nothing on the news, even.

I swear I saw a cop get shot

yesterday. How come no one is talking

about it?

YORGI

I also check the wire transfer. I

follow the money back to it's source,

but there is no source. It comes

from nowhere. First they bring CIA,

then British SAS, now maybe they

plumb the lower depths. Maybe now

they send someone who looks like us.

Maybe someone like our houseguest

Mr. X.

PETRA

I don't know what you're talking

about.

XANDER

The eyes don't lie. All this has

gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You

came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and

you stayed because it was fun. Now

you don't like it so much, but you're

in so deep you can't get out anymore.

Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.

PETRA

Go to hell!

XANDER

Look at you. You're helping run things

now. You're a gangster. I bet that

snuck up on you. You woke up one day

and you were a criminal.

XANDER

It's cool, I feel you. I might even

be able to help. Here, let me show

you something. You wanna see what's

in my pocket, I'll show you.

PETRA

What are you?

XANDER

I'm an information gatherer. You

wanna go somewhere and talk about

it?

YORGI

Where is he?

VIKTOR

They went to breakfast.

PETRA

Perogies, potato pancakes, fried

goose livers, the sausage plate and

a pot of Turkish coffee.

XANDER

I'm just gonna have a garden salad.

Oil and balsamic vinegar on the side.

PETRA

That's how you eat? It's like a

gerbil.

XANDER

(shrugs)

I'm from L.A.

PETRA

So why don't you tell me something

about who you gather information

for. They obviously have very deep

pockets. Are you from a rival clan?

XANDER

Let's just say I'm freelancing and

leave it at that.

PETRA

Whoever sent you knew what they were

doing. You and Yorgi are practically

twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims

who make a lot of noise but don't

say much.

XANDER

Don't judge a comic book by it's

cover.

PETRA

You agree with a lot of what he says,

don't you.

XANDER

I know where he's coming from. The

only thing I really don't get is why

he dumped you. Up until I found that

out, I thought his judgment was pretty

sound.

PETRA

Don't even start. I'll be honest, I

don't trust you. Bur lets pretend

for a minute that what you say is

true, that I want to leave. What can

you do about it?

XANDER

The people I know want facts, the

kinds of things an insider would

know. They're interested in putting

Anarchy 99 out of business.

PETRA

All I have to do is risk my life

providing you with these facts.

XANDER

We could work together. Then maybe

we could both get the hell out of

here. There's a beach in Bora Bora

with my name on it.

PETRA

A beach named X? That I'd like to

see.

XANDER

So there you have it. I guess you

just have to ask yourself, how bad

to you want out?

PETRA

(into phone)

Da!

KIRILL (O.S.)

(on phone)

Listen very carefully, Petra. We

think Cage may be an American agent,

do you understand what I'm telling

you?

PETRA

(into phone)

Yes.

KIRILL (O.S.)

(on phone)

Don't worry, I've got your back. I'm

right across the street, above the

bakery. Just bring him outside and

let me do the rest.

XANDER

What's up? Is there a problem?

PETRA

They tell me you're an American agent.

XANDER

What are you talking about?

PETRA

There's no more time for games. They

made you. There's a sniper out front

waiting to put a bullet in your eye.

Tell me if it's true.

XANDER

It's a long story, but yeah, more or

less.

PETRA

Jesus Christ. You're going to have

to go out the back. The data that

you copied with your toy. Tomorrow,

at six o'clock. Look it up. We're

taking a trip. Be there at six and

you'll have plenty to tell your

people.

XANDER

If I go out the back, he'll know

you've warned me.

PETRA

That's alright, I'll figure something

out.

XANDER

Not an option. Just get up slowly

like everything's cool. Petra, trust

me. You just hung yourself out to

dry for me, I'm not gonna let you

down.

P.O.V. Through scope - he can faintly see them inside the

KIRILL

Nice and easy, Petra...

PETRA

I can't let this happen. I want you

to go out the back. I'll make up

some excuse.

XANDER

They'll kill you, you know they will.

Besides, there is no back door. Keep

smiling. Ready? Now.

P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is sporadically visible

FADE TO:

XANDER

Very nice.

XANDER

Let's see what's going on inside...

YORGI

Ready the boat.

XANDER

What the hell are you guys stealing?

KIRILL

Ready.

PETRA

What are you doing?

YORGI

It all happened so fast. Such an

unfortunate accident.

YORGI

Let's go.

XANDER

What the hell...?

XANDER

No way, man, no way. I'm just supposed

to be an observer. Aw shit. This job

sucks.

XANDER

Toby Lee Shavers, if this thing don't

work, your ass is kicked.

YORGI

What was that for?

PETRA

I'd forgotten how exciting it is

working together.

YORGI

You've been so quiet lately, Petra,

I thought you no longer cared.

PETRA

Why don't we go below decks and work

off some of this adrenaline.

YORGI

(smiles)

Viktor! Stay the course.

XANDER

Son of a bitch!

XANDER

Is the boy alright?

CAPTAIN

Yes. I will cut the others loose,

you must run the bilge pumps!

XANDER

You sure?

XANDER

Captain, huh? You get a lot of broads

with that uniform?

FADE TO:

XANDER

(into communicator)

They call it "Ahab", it's a solar

powered submersible. It can

circumnavigate the globe on it's

own. They use it to track and study

the migration patterns of whales.

GIBBONS

You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about

that?

XANDER

Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's

what I'm thinking. If they take out

the cameras and sensors, they could

probably put a bomb in this thing.

You drop it in the water in the Red

Sea and three weeks later it's

swimming up the Potomac.

GIBBONS

This is good work, X, damn fine work.

You need to press on at all costs,

find out what they have planned with

this "Ahab".

XANDER

Hey, one miracle at a time. They're

on to me now, remember?

GIBBONS

I'm gonna be en route with a team

shortly to relieve you. Just keep

the pressure on until the cavalry

arrives. And X? You done yourself

proud helping those people today.

XANDER

Thanks.

GIBBONS

You're a grungy little phoenix, you

know that? Keep up the good work.

XANDER

You ain't seen nothing yet.

CUT TO:

XANDER

Get in. We've got work to do.

XANDER

I want all that...

(he pats the GTO)

In there.

XANDER

Right behind you.

XANDER

So what's the plan with this Ahab?

Are they selling it or what?

PETRA

No, something worse. He says it's a

surprise, but I know him. This is

his masterpiece.

XANDER

We've got to find out what it is.

Can you handle that?

PETRA

(beat)

There's something I didn't have time

to tell you before.

XANDER

What's that?

PETRA

I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been

undercover for over a year.

XANDER

You're what? What the hell have you

been doing?

PETRA

I don't know. Eight months ago I

stop hearing from my people. No

explanation, just silence. So I stay

and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm

in so far, they'd kill me if I left.

Now every day I get farther and

farther away from what I was. I'm

like you said, a criminal.

XANDER

I'm busted up for you, but Jesus,

what the hell are you doing? Those

people almost drowned on that boat

and you didn't lift a finger.

PETRA

No, I guess I've been no help at all

to you.

XANDER

Get your head back in the game. There

are lives at stake here.

PETRA

Of course. I'll do what I can. I

have to go, before they notice.

XANDER

When can I see you again?

PETRA

You can't, it's too risky. I'm not

much help anyway, remember?

VIKTOR

Okay, fire one.

YORGI

Perfect!

XANDER

Great piece of hardware.

ANDERS

(singing)

"Silent Night... Holy Night"

XANDER

Damn.

KIRILL

There's some bullshit going on!

YORGI

Xander, my friend, that can only be

you. Why don't we put our weapons

down for a few minutes and discuss

this like friends. How would you

like to come to work for us instead?

We could Rage Against the Machine

together.

XANDER

Speaking of people that are full of

shit, funny you should mention those

guys!

XANDER

They put their records out through

Sony, one of the biggest corporate

machines on the planet. Some

revolutionaries, huh?

YORGI

Come on, you're the one who's fooling

yourself. Why risk your life for

your government when we can offer

you a future that is truly free?

YORGI

He blew the gate control. Anders!

Get the bastard!

XANDER

Slovo?

XANDER

Dude, what are you doing here?

SLOVO

You killed me, remember? Now I have

to hide out here with you. Where

have you been?

XANDER

I found something big enough for us

to take these guys down with. They've

got a of nerve agent they're gonna

unleash.

SLOVO

Is this what you're looking for?

XANDER

Yeah, give it here.

SLOVO

Sorry, "dude".

XANDER

(stunned beat)

What's the deal?

SLOVO

Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got

played, so what? You're new at this.

Did you think you could just stroll

into this business one day and have

all the angles figured out?

XANDER

Why you dogging me up?

SLOVO

(shrugs)

They came and found me. They said

they'd kill me unless I help them.

Plus they offer me a lot of money.

No big deal. These things happen.

Dump your gun on the floor.

SLOVO

Where do you want it? The head to be

quick? Or the chest for an open

casket?

PETRA

Are you alright?

XANDER

What the hell are you doing? You

could've killed me!

PETRA

(shrugs)

I heard you talking. I could tell

where you were in the room.

XANDER

I don't know what's going on anymore.

I thought I was square with that

dude. Now everybody's switching sides

like it's the WWF.

XANDER

What are you doing with the Ivans?

PETRA

I know which cops are good and which

are bad. Come with me. Come on, right

now.

XANDER

Where are we going?

PETRA

We're getting out of this place.

We've done enough.

XANDER

Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go

now. What's Yorgi got planned with

that nerve agent?

PETRA

It doesn't matter anymore, forget

it.

XANDER

Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!

PETRA

What do we owe our governments? Yours

kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.

XANDER

Petra, this ain't about the people

that sent us here, you know that.

PETRA

No, now it's about us. Let's do

something for us before we both get

killed. Don't you want to get to

Bora Bora, Xander?

XANDER

We can't leave now. We have to do

something.

PETRA

Why? You're the one who believes in

nothing. Screw the world, or whatever

you said.

XANDER

Alright, so I was full of shit. I

thought believing in things was wrong.

Turns out believing in nothing is

worse. You might as well be dead.

I'm not thrilled with the world, but

I'm not gonna let those idiots start

killing people. Come on, you're a

cop, we've got to get these guys.

PETRA

They left. To a fortress in the

mountains.

XANDER

We'll have to go after them.

PETRA

Aren't you afraid?

XANDER

A long time ago I learned how to put

fear away in a little place in my

head. Maybe that's my problem. If

you don't feel fear you can do some

amazing things, but you can also

screw your life up in ways you can't

imagine.

PETRA

I must be healthy, then, because I'm

scared to death. I guess I'd better

get back to Yorgi.

XANDER

You don't have to do that.

PETRA

Yes, I do. You're right. I can't

just let him go free. Besides, I can

help you from the inside.

XANDER

Aren't they gonna wonder were you've

been?

PETRA

(shrugs)

I was supposed to wait for the cop

to kill you and then kill the cop.

They'll believe me.

(beat)

I've been lying for so long, one

more time won't hurt.

XANDER

When this is over, we're just gonna

take off, the two of us. Take a

vacation.

PETRA

What the hell are we doing? We're

doing all this together, trusting

each other, making plans, and we

haven't even slept together yet.

XANDER

That gives us something to live for.

VIKTOR

Hold positions!

XANDER

Nothing like fresh powder.

XANDER

(into communicator)

Gibbons, long time no talk. You

wouldn't believe my day.

GIBBONS

What the hell has been going on,

Triple X? How about a status report?

XANDER

Snow covered fortress. Army of bad

guys. The usual.

GIBBONS

I'm on the way with a team to relieve

you. What's the latest?

XANDER

They retrofitted Ahab with some kind

of rocket launcher. They were loading

canisters of liquid into it, light

colored and dark colored in the same

tube but separate. Something tells

me this it that "classified" stuff

you didn't want me to know about.

Does the song "Silent Night" mean

anything to you?

GIBBONS

Yes it does.

XANDER

Come on, Gibbons, you can do better

then that.

GIBBONS

Silent Night is the name of a top

secret binary nerve agent. The glass

canister is shot into the air and

detonated. The black and white

chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud.

When it settles down to Earth, it'll

kill everything in the vicinity.

XANDER

Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is

something we came up with?

GIBBONS

Yeah, that's right. So now that you

know, you understand why it's

important that we get it back.

XANDER

Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're

not supposed to be making weapons

like that anyway. Guess we shoulda

played by the rules.

GIBBONS

Somebody else makes those decisions,

not guys like you and me. You've

done your job, X, head back to Prague.

I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This

is my operation now.

XANDER

We don't have that kinda time, boss,

I don't think Prague's gonna be around

much longer. I've gotta go now. I've

got a lot of bad guys to kill.

GUARD

(in Russian)

What's going on?

YORGI

That was for Anders.

XANDER

Don't forget goatee boy. I greased

him up on the diamond run.

YORGI

Look who we found playing outside.

YORGI

Petra, my sweet dove, do you notice

anything strange about X? He looks

slightly less than dead.

PETRA

Yorgi, I thought he was --

YORGI

Do you think I didn't know about you

all along? My contacts in the KGB

told me you were coming. You show up

undercover and, I must admit, you

play your part to the hilt. When

it's time to be cruel, you are cruel.

When it's time to be passionate, you

are very very passionate indeed.

YORGI

I could have killed you, but I thought

this would be so much more fun. To

twist you and use you how I see fit.

And to be honest, you went much

farther than I ever expected you

would for your country.

YORGI

And you. Why do you have such a

problem staying away, my friend? Did

you miss us that much?

XANDER

I wanted to get the hell out of Prague

before Silent Night falls.

YORGI

Not bad, man, not bad. You put things

together quick. Prague it is.

PETRA

The Peace conference...

YORGI

Nice place to start, don't you think?

XANDER

What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's

the part I don't get. You gonna hold

the world hostage with your gas bombs?

I didn't think you were dumb enough

to go with that hack cliche.

YORGI

You think I'm after money? I told

you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a

change. Money is good, but for true

freedom you have to get rid of the

rules themselves.

XANDER

So all by yourself, you're going to

destroy every government; in the

world.

YORGI

Easier than that, buddy. I'll get

them to destroy each other. You kill

an entire Peace conference, someone

is going to have to pay. Then our

friend Ahab continues down the river

to the ocean and begins his world

tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty

soon everyone's involved. These guys

bomb those guys, those guys invade

these guys. Soon the whole world is

like your wild West cowboy days. No

rules, no law, everybody free to do

what they want.

XANDER

Including rape, pillage, murder.

YORGI

Sure, if that's what you want. Why

not? It's all human nature. So we

just have to launch our baby and

wait for the decline and fall of

civilization as we know it.

XANDER

And here I thought "anarchy" was

just something cool to put on a

Tshirt.

YORGI

Come on, Xander. You used to stand

for something. What happened to you,

man? I thought you'd get it.

PETRA

Don't you see, X? For the betterment

of humanity, he's going to start

World War Three.

XANDER

He's a regular humanitarian. And all

this time I thought he was just a

tool.

YORGI

You both could have been a part of

it. You could have ridden with us

into a new day, the dawning of a new

age of --

XANDER

Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry

I asked.

YORGI

Screw you too, buddy.

YORGI

Hurry up, kill him!

XANDER

Hey! We're on your side!

XANDER

Petra! Tell them something!

XANDER

How's Ivan?

IVAN 2

He is okay.

XANDER

Thanks for coming, man, you guys

were right on time.

IVAN 2

We are always on time. Two have

escaped, in truck.

PETRA

Yorgi and Kirill.

XANDER

Let me guess, they had a big white

torpedo with them.

IVAN 2

Yes. Your friend, the angry one, he

send something for you.

IVAN 2

We'll be right behind you.

XANDER

Did you do your homework?

PETRA

(nods)

If they launch it, I know how to

bring it back.

XANDER

Let's do this.

XANDER

Where's he headed?

PETRA

He owns a big industrial complex on

the river. He'll launch it from there.

YORGI

(in Russian, subtitled)

They're coming! Get back there.

XANDER

You get down! I'll take care of this

fool!

PETRA

No! Don't shoot! He's hiding behind

the nerve agent!

XANDER

Goddamit! He's gonna stop playing

around soon and shoot something

valuable!

XANDER

Let's see what my man put together.

XANDER

Where'd the damn truck go?!

PETRA

Go to the water, it's that way!

XANDER

Toadies right behind.

PETRA

Let me.

PETRA

Fantastic options.

YORGI

I've got it, go! Cover me!

XANDER

You okay?

PETRA

A piece of shrapnel hit me.

XANDER

I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop

playing nice.

KIRILL

What are you doing!

XANDER

I guess the surgeon general was right.

PETRA

He's shut out the communication

circuit!

XANDER

You can't talk to it?

PETRA

No, it's like a safety. We are going

to have to access the manual controls.

XANDER

A manual control on a moving torpedo.

This day keeps getting better and

better.

XANDER

Radio Ivan! Tell him what's going

down! Have them evacuate downtown!

PETRA

It's running three meters down. Twenty

knots.

XANDER

It has to surface to release the

nerve agent, right?

PETRA

By then it's too late! The only way

to safely dispose of the nerve agent

is in deep water! The chemicals will

break down and dissipate!

XANDER

Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow

it up underwater!

PETRA

There it is! Hold it steady!

XANDER

Petra!

PETRA

Xander! It's coming up!

YORGI

This is going to be exciting, buddy!

Front row seats to the apocalypse!

Come on, sing with me!

(singing madly)

"I am an Antichrist / I am an

anarchist / I... wan-na be...

Anarchy!"

XANDER

No you don't.

GIBBONS

Thought you bought the farm down

there, X. Glad as hell to see you.

XANDER

I'm pretty happy to see me too. So

are you done with me yet?

GIBBONS

You've kept up your end of the

bargain, I'll do the same. But you

really should consider staying on,

you make a decent agent.

XANDER

But I hate cops, remember? Except

for her.

GIBBONS

Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there.

You're a hero. Don't be afraid to

join the good guys.

XANDER

Who says you're the good guys?

GIBBONS

You know what they say, the only way

to change the system is from the

inside.

XANDER

Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking

this thing off my ankle? The poison

needles?

GIBBONS

On come on, X. Did you really think

we were that barbaric?

XANDER

No needles, huh? What about the acid

bath?

GIBBONS

All for show. Just a psychological

mind game to get you to do the right

thing.

XANDER

(smiles)

You're a jerk-off, you know that?

GIBBONS

We'll be talking soon, you'll see.

You'll be back.

PETRA

I can't believe my mission is finally

over. I don't even know what to do

with myself.

XANDER

You can't welch on me now. We had a

deal.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

PETRA

(laughing)

What are you doing?

XANDER

It's about your next mission. You

need to be debriefed.

THE END
