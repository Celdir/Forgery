DANA

(exasperated)

Frank, do you think you could give me a hand

with these bags?

FRANK

I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a

building superintendent.

DANA

You're also a human being, Frank.

FRANK

(reluctantly going to help)

Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the

hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the

grocery bags from her.

DANA

(setting the wheel brakes on

the buggy)

Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this

eventually.

FRANK

(to the baby)

Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?

FRANK

(to Dana)

That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.

Barrett.

DANA

(finding her keys)

Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to

fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you

last week.

FRANK

Didn't I do it?

DANA

No, you didn't, Frank.

FRANK

Okay, that's no problem.

DANA

That's exactly what you said last week.

CUT TO:

STANTZ

(all business)

How many of them are there, ma'am?

WOMAN

Fourteen.  They're in the back.  I hope you can

handle them.  It's been like a nightmare.

WINSTON

How big are they?

WINSTON

(resolute)

We'll do our best, ma'am.

WOMAN

They're right out here.

STANTZ

Ready?

WINSTON

I'm ready.

STANTZ

Then let's do it.

KIDS

(disappointed)

Ghostbusters!!  Boooo!!

WINSTON

(trying his best)

How you doin', kids?

LITTLE BOY

(nasty)

I though we were having He-Man.

STANTZ

He-Man couldn't make it today.  That's why

we're here.

BOY

My dad says you're full of crap.

STANTZ

(stopped cold)

Well, a lot of people have trouble believing

in the paranormal.

BOY

No, he just says you're full of crap and that's

why you went out of business.

STANTZ

(low and menacing)

I'm watching you.

(to Winston)

Song.

STANTZ AND WINSTON

'There's something wrong in the neighborhood.

Who you gonna call?'

KIDS

(all together)

He-Man!!

CUT TO:

WINSTON

That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties.

I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged

nine-year-olds.

STANTZ

Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The

holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.

WINSTON

Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past.

Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year

these kids won't even remember who we are.

STANTZ

(tries to start the car again)

Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we

did for this city.

WINSTON

Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job

we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow

man and blew the top three floors off an uptown

highrise.

STANTZ

Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a

hamburger without chopping up a cow.

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'

I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,

author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton

Anglund.

(to his guest)

Milt, your new book is called The End of the

World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about

gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you

think anybody wants to read a book about it?

MILTON

Well, I think it's important for people to know

that the world is in danger.

VENKMAN

Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to

happen or do we have to buy the book?

MILTON

I predict that the world will end at the

stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

VENKMAN

This year?  That's cutting it a little close,

isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of

view, the book just came out, right?  So you're

not even looking at the paperback release for

maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least

another year after that if the thing has

movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.

You would have been better off predicting 1992

or even '94 just to be safe.

MILTON

(irritated)

This is not just some money-making scheme!  I

didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong

psychic belief that the world will end on New

Year's Eve.

VENKMAN

(placating)

Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But

I think my other guest may disagree with you.

Elaine, you had another date in mind?

ELAINE

According to my sources, the world will end

on February 14, in the year 2016.

VENKMAN

Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer.

Where did you get that date, Elaine?

ELAINE

I received this information from an alien.  I

was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having

a drink in the bar when he approached me and

started talking.  Then he must have used some

sort of ray or a mind control device because

he made me follow him to his room and that's

where he told me about the end of the world.

VENKMAN

Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?

ELAINE

It may have been a room on the spacecraft made

up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I

can't be sure, Peter.

VENKMAN

(humoring her)

No, you can't, and I think that's the whole

problem with aliens; you just can't trust them.

You may get some nice ones occasionally like

Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to

be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just

about out of time.

(does his wrap-up right TO

the CAMERA)

Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless

pets.

(holds up a hairless cat)

Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...

(puts a finger to his temple

and sends out a though to his

viewers)

... Good night.

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

Where do you find these people?  I thought

we were having the telekinetic guy who bends

the spoons?

NORMAN

A lot of the better psychics won't come on the

show.  They think you're too skeptical.

VENKMAN

Skeptical!  Norman, I'm a pushover.  I think

professional wrestling is real.

VENKMAN

(to Norman)

What's all this?

NORMAN

They just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'

VENKMAN

The Mayor!  He's a friend of mine.

VENKMAN

(calling to the Mayor)

Lenny!

VENKMAN

(starts to follow him)

Lenny!  It's Pete Venkman!

HARDEMEYER

(snide)

Can I help you?

VENKMAN

(dangerous)

Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

HARDEMEYER

I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant.

What can I do for you?

VENKMAN

I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just

want to say hello to him.

HARDEMEYER

(scornful)

I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting

any ghosts lately?

VENKMAN

No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor

about.  We did a little job for the city a

while back and we ended up getting sued,

screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.

HARDEMEYER

(bristling)

Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall,

barring a disaster, he's going to be elected

governor of this state and the last thing we

need is for him to be associated with two-bit

frauds and publicity hounds like you and your

friends.  You read me?

VENKMAN

Okay, I get it.  But I want you to tell Lenny

that, because of you, I'm not voting for him.

CUT TO:

JANOSZ

(with an East European accent)

Still working on the Turner?

DANA

Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,

Janosz.

JANOSZ

You know, you are really doing very good work

here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist

me in some of the more important restorations.

DANA

Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here,

but now that my baby's a little older, I was

hoping to rejoin the orchestra.

JANOSZ

(disappointed)

We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I

could take you to lunch today?

DANA

Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have

an appointment.

(looks at her watch)

In fact, I'd better go.

JANOSZ

Every day I ask you, and every day you've got

something else to do.  Do I have bad breath

or something?

DANA

(trying to brush him off)

I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.

JANOSZ

Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.

JANOSZ

(to himself)

I think she likes me.

CUT TO:

DANA

... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped

dead in the middle of the street

SPENGLER

Did anyone else see this happen?

DANA

Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't

imagine this.

SPENGLER

I'm not saying you did.  In science we always

look for the simplest explanation.

ASSISTANT

We're ready, Dr. Spengler

SPENGLER

(to the Assistant)

We'll start with the negative calibration.

DANA

(curious)

What are you working on, Egon?

SPENGLER

I'm trying to determine whether human

emotional states have a measurable effect on

the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a

theory Ray and I were working on when we had

to dissolve Ghostbusters.

SPENGLER

(to Dana)

They think they're here for marriage

counseling.  We've kept them waiting for two

hours and we've been gradually increasing the

temperature in the room.

(checking a heat sensor)

It's up to 95 degrees at the moment.  Now my

assistant is going to enter and ask them if

they'd mind waiting another half-hour.

SPENGLER

We'll do the happiness index next.

(to Dana)

I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if

it's all right with you.

DANA

Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.

SPENGLER

Oh no.

DANA

(affectedly casual)

Do you ever see him?

SPENGLER

Occasionally

DANA

How is he these days?

SPENGLER

Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a

while there.  Then he crossed the border.

DANA

Does he ever mention me?

SPENGLER

No.  Not that I can recall.

DANA

(slightly disappointed)

Well, we didn't part on very good terms and

we sort of lost track of each other when I

got married.

ASSISTANT

We're ready for the affection test.

SPENGLER

(to the assistant)

Good.  Send in the puppy.

DANA

(continuing)

I thought of calling him after my marriage

ended, but --.  Anyway, I appreciate you're

doing this, Egon

DANA

(handing him a card)

This is my address and telephone number.

Will you call me?

SPENGLER

Certainly.

DANA

Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of

this to Peter if you don't mind.

SPENGLER

I won't.

DANA

Thank you.

SPENGLER

(to his assistant)

Now let's see how she reacts when we take

away the puppy

CUT TO:

STANTZ

(v.o., answering the phone)

Ray's Occult.

STANTZ

(on the phone)

Yeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What

have I got?  I've got alchemy, astrology,

apparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon

intercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic

surgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie

sightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've

got it all -- what are you looking for? ...

Don't have any.  Try the stockyards.

SPENGLER

Who was that?

STANTZ

Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come

up with anything?

SPENGLER

(referring to the book)

This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a

flower cart took off by itself and rolled

approximately half a kilometer over level

ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.

STANTZ

You might want to check those Duke University

mean averaging studies on controlled

psychokinesis.

SPENGLER

(going to the stacks)

Good idea.

VENKMAN

Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm

looking for an aerosol love potion I could

spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would

make her unconditionally submit to an unusual

personal request.

STANTZ

Oh, hiya, Pete.

VENKMAN

So, no goat hooves, huh?

STANTZ

(strung)

I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's

up?  How's it going?

VENKMAN

Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and

buy me a sub?

STANTZ

(slightly evasive)

Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.

VENKMAN

Egon!

SPENGLER

Hello, Venkman.

VENKMAN

How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet

those science chicks really dig that big

cranium of yours, huh?

SPENGLER

I think they're more interested in my

epididymis.

VENKMAN

I don't even want to know where that is.

STANTZ

Oh, your book came in, Venkman.  Magical

Paths to Fortune and Power.

VENKMAN

Great.

(reading the contents)

So what are you guys working on?

STANTZ

Oh, just checking something for an old friend.

VENKMAN

Who?

STANTZ

(at a loss)

Who?  Just -- someone we know.

VENKMAN

Oh, Ray --

VENKMAN

Who?  Who?  Who?

STANTZ

Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!

VENKMAN

Who, Ray?

STANTZ

(giving in)

Dana!  Dana Barrett!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DANA

(hugging Ray)

Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for

coming.

STANTZ

No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.

DANA

(to Spengler)

Hi, Egon.

VENKMAN

Hi, Dana.

VENKMAN

I knew you'd come crawling back to me.

DANA

Hello, Peter.

VENKMAN

(to Dana)

You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you

didn't call me first.  I'm still into all

this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen

my show?

DANA

I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.

VENKMAN

I can see that you're still very bitter about

us, but in the interest of science, I'm going

to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work,

boys.

VENKMAN

So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he

ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.

DANA

He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems,

he got a good offer from an orchestra in

England and he took it.

VENKMAN

He ditched you.  You should've married me,

you know.

DANA

You never asked me, and every time I brought

it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.

VENKMAN

Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to

feel loved and desired, too.

DANA

Well, when you started introducing me as "the

old ball and chain," that's when I left.

VENKMAN

I may have a few personal problems but one thing

I am is a total professional.

VENKMAN

What are you going to do, Egon?  Knit him a

snowsuit?

SPENGLER

I'd like to have a stool specimen

VENKMAN

Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or

professional reasons?

VENKMAN

(picking up the baby)

Okay, kid.  Up you go.

VENKMAN

Help!  Please somebody help me!  Get him off!

Quickly!  He's gone completely berserk!

DANA

What do you think?

VENKMAN

There's no doubt about it.  He's got his

father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely

ugly.  And smelly.

(resumes playing with the baby)

You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the

stinkiest baby I ever smelled.

(to Dana)

What's his name?

DANA

His name is Oscar.

VENKMAN

Oscar!  You poor kid!

DANA

(losing patience)

Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you

think there's anything unusual about him.

VENKMAN

Unusual?

(holds up the baby and

scrutinizes him)

I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of

experience with babies.

DANA

(taking the specimen jar)

I'll do it.

VENKMAN

I'll supervise.

VENKMAN

(to Stantz)

Well, Holmes, what do you think?

STANTZ

It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything

was going on it's totally subdued now.

VENKMAN

(to Spengler)

What now, Brainiac?

SPENGLER

I think we should see if we can find

anything abnormal on the street.

VENKMAN

Finding something abnormal on the street

shouldn't be too hard.

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

(to Dana, nostalgic)

Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't

it?

(pointing out familiar

neighborhood sights)

There's our old cash machine.  And the dry

cleaners we used to go to.  And the old

video store.

(he wipes away an imaginary

tear)

We really had some good times, didn't we?

DANA

We definitely had a moment or two.

DANA

That's where the buggy stopped.

VENKMAN

Okay, let's take a look.

STANTZ

(reading the PKE meter)

Is this the spot?

DANA

A little to the left.  Right there!  That's

where it stopped.

STANTZ

Nothing.  Not a trace.

SPENGLER

Why don't we try the Giga-meter?

VENKMAN

What's that?

STANTZ

Egon and I have been working on a gauge to

measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -

giga electron volts.

SPENGLER

That's a thousand million electron volts.

VENKMAN

I knew that.

STANTZ

I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's

something brewing under the street.

DANA

(worried, to Venkman)

Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic

problem or something that makes me vulnerable

to these supernatural things.

VENKMAN

You mean like the time you got possessed and

turned into a monster terror dog?  No, not

a chance.  Total coincidence.

(to Stantz and Spengler)

Am I right?

CUT TO:

VIGO

I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the

sorrow of Moldavia, command you.

JANOSZ

(in agony)

Command me, lord.

VIGO

On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain,

I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will

be, what is will be no more.  Now is the

season of evil.  Find me a child that I might

live again.

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

I love this.  We're onto something really

big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to

make some headlines with this one.

STANTZ

Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts?

If anybody found out about this we'd be in

serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have

been clearer - no ghostbusting.

VENKMAN

Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing

nice and quiet, low key, no profile.

FIRST COP

How ya doing?

SPENGLER

(reeking with guilt)

Fine!  It's cutting fine now.

FIRST COP

(curious)

Why are you cutting?

SPENGLER

(looking for one of the

others)

Why are we cutting?  Uh - boss!

FIRST COP

What are you doing here?

VENKMAN

(belligerent)

What the hell's it look like we're doing?

We're bustin out asses over here 'cause

some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'

better to do than make idiots like us work

late on a Friday night, right?

(looks to Spengler for

agreement)

SPENGLER

(with a "right on" fist)

Yo.

FIRST COP

Okay, boys, take it easy.

SPENGLER

You were supposed to help me with this.

VENKMAN

You need the exercise.

STANTZ

(examing it)

NYPRR.  What the hell -- ?  Help me lift

this.

STANTZ

(shining a flashlight into

the hole)

Wow!  It's an old airshaft.  It just goes

forever.

SPENGLER

Very intense.  We need a deeper reading.

Somebody has to go down there.

STANTZ

Thanks, boys.

STANTZ (O.S.)

(his voice echoing in the

airshaft)

Keep going -- more -- more --

STANTZ

(using a radio now)

Lower -- lower --

(to himself)

Gee, this really is deep.

STANTZ

(shouts)

Hold it!  Steady!

STANTZ

(reverently)

This is it, boys, the end of the line.  Van

Horne Station.  The old New York Pneumatic.

It's still here.

SPENGLER

(explaining)

The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an

experimental subway system.  Fan-forced

air-trains, built around 1870.

STANTZ

(over the walkie-talkie)

This is about as deep as you can go under

Manhattan without digging your own hole.

SPENGLER

(to Stantz)

What's the reading?

STANTZ

(on the radio)

Off the top of the scale.  This place is

really hot.  Lower me to the floor.

STANTZ

(shouts)

Hold it!!  Stop!!  Whoa!!

STANTZ

(ranting on the radio)

Oh, my God!  It's a seething, bubbling,

psychic cess!  Interlocked tubes of plasm,

crackling with negative GEVs!  It's glowing

and moving!  It's -- it's a river of slime!!

STANTZ

(on the radio)

Haul me up, Venkman!  Now!

SUPERVISOR

(no nonsense)

Okay, what's the story here?

VENKMAN

What, I got time for this?  We got three

thousand phones out in the Village and about

eight million miles of cable to check.

SUPERVISOR

(not buying it)

The phone lines are over there.

(points to the curb)

VENKMAN

I told ya!

STANTZ (O.S.)

(filtered)

Help!  Help!  Pull me up!  It's alive!  It's

eating my boots.

FIRST COP

You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company.

We checked.  Tell me another one.

VENKMAN

Gas leak?

STANTZ

(shouting)

Get me out of here!!

STANTZ (O.S.)

Sorry.

DANA

(surprised)

Janosz?

JANOSZ

Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the

neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to

see if everything's all right with you --

you know, with the blackout and everything?

Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?

DANA

(mechanically and cautiously)

We're fine, Janosz.

JANOSZ

Do you need anything?  You want me to come

in?

DANA

No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks

anyway.

JANOSZ

Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night,

Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs

bite you.

DANA

Good night, Janosz.

CUT TO:

JUDGE

I want to make one thing very clear before

we go any further.  The law does not recognize

the existence of ghosts, and I don't believe

in them either, so I don't want to hear a

lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and

demons.  We're going to stick to the facts

in this case and save the ghost stories for

the kiddies.  Understood?

STANTZ

Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?

SPENGLER

His nickname is "The Hammer."

LOUIS

(nervous)

I think you're making a big mistake here,

fellas.  I do mostly tax law and some probate

stuff occasionally.  I got my law degree at

night school.

STANTZ

That's all right.  We got arrested at night.

DANA

I wish I could stay.  I feel personally

responsible for you being here.

VENKMAN

You are personally responsible.  If I can

get conjugal rights, will you visit me at

Sing Sing?

DANA

Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.

VENKMAN

Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.

DANA

You mean you cough up hairballs all over

the rug?

VENKMAN

I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.

DANA

(sincerely)

Good luck.

VENKMAN

Thanks.

HARDEMEYER

How are you doing, hon?  Just put these guys

away fast and make sure they go away for a

long, long time.

PROSECUTOR

It shouldn't be hard with this list of charges.

HARDEMEYER

Good.  Very good.  The mayor and future

governor won't forget this.

HARDEMEYER

(gloating)

Nice going, Venkman.  Violating a judicial

restraining order, willful destruction of

public property, fraud, malicious mischief

-- smooth move.  See you in a couple years

-- at your first parole hearing.

LOUIS

Gee, the whole city's against us.  I think

I'm going to be sick.

PROSECUTOR

Mr. Fianella, please look at Exhibits A

through F on the table over there.  Do you

recognize that equipment?

CON ED

(o.c.)

That's the stuff the cops found in their

truck.

PROSECUTOR

Do you know what this equipment is used for?

CON ED

(shrugs)

I don't know.  Catching ghosts, I guess.

PROSECUTOR

(to the Judge)

May I remind the court that the defendants

are under a judicial restraining order that

specifically forbids them from performing

services as paranormal investigators and

eliminators.

JUDGE

So noted.

PROSECUTOR

Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the

substance in the jar on the table marked

Exhibit F?

CON ED

I been working underground for Con Ed for

27 years and I never saw anything like that

in my life.  We checked out that tunnel the

next day and we didn't find nothing.  If it

was down there, they must have put it there.

STANTZ

(defensively)

Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have

been ten thousand gallons of it down there.

SPENGLER

It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal

source.

LOUIS

(nervously)

Should I say that?

SPENGLER

I doubt that they'd believe us.

WIPE TO:

LOUIS

So like you were just trying to help out

your old friend because she was scared and

you didn't really mean to do anything bad

and you really love the city and won't ever

do anything like this again, right?

PROSECUTOR

Objection, your Honor.  He's leading the

witness.

JUDGE

The witness is leading him.  Sustained.

LOUIS

Okay, let me rephrase that question.

(to venkman)

Didn't you once coach a basketball team for

underprivileged children?

VENKMAN

Yes, I did.  We were city champs.

PROSECUTOR

Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.

JUDGE

Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything

to ask this witness that may have some

bearing on this case?

LOUIS

(to Venkman)

Do I?

VENKMAN

No, I think you've helped them enough already.

LOUIS

(to the Judge)

No, I guess not.

(to the Prosecutor)

Your witness.

PROSECUTOR

So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court

why it is you and your co-defendants took it

upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the

middle of the street.

VENKMAN

Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many

holes already we didn't think anyone would

notice.

JUDGE

Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in

contempt.

VENKMAN

Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets

me up like that I can't resist.

PROSECUTOR

I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were

you digging the hole?  And please remember

that you're under oath.

VENKMAN

I had my fingers crossed when they swore me

in, but I'm going to tell you the truth.

There are things in this world that go way

beyond human understanding, things that

can't be explained and that most people don't

want to know about anyway.  That's where we

come in.

PROSECUTOR

So what are you saying?  That the world of

the supernatural is your special province?

VENKMAN

No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens

and somebody has to deal with it.

WIPE TO:

JUDGE

Does the counsel for the defense wish to

make any final arguements?

LOUIS

Your honor, may I approach the bench?

JUDGE

(impatient)

Yes.

LOUIS

(to the judge)

Can I have some of your water?

JUDGE

Get on with it, counselor!

LOUIS

(scared)

Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --

(he remembers there's no

jury)

audience.  I don't think it's fair to call

my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was

a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in

an elevator for about three hours and I had

to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I

don't blame them because once I turned into

a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.

SPENGLER

(to Louis)

Way to go.  Concise and to the point.

JUDGE

That's it?  That's all you have to say?

LOUIS

Did I forget something?

JUDGE

That was unquestionably the worst

presentation of a case I've ever heard in a

court of law!  I ought to cite you for

contempt and have you disbarred.  As for

your clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz

and Egon Spengler, on the charges of

conspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction

of public property, I find you guilty on all

counts.  I order you to pay fines in the

amount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to

eighteen months in the city correctional

facility at Ryker's Island.

STANTZ

Uh-oh, she's twitchin'.

JUDGE

And on a more personal note, let me go on

record as saying that there is no place in

decent society for fakes, charlatans and

tricksters like you who prey on the

gullibility of innocent people.  You're

beneath the contempt of this court.  And

believe me, if my hands were not tied by the

unalterable fetters of the law, a law which

has become in my view far too permissive and

inadequate in it's standards of punishment,

I would invoke the tradition of our

illustrious forebearers, reach back to a

sterner, purer justice and have you burned

at the stake!

STANTZ

Under the table, boys!

JUDGE

(in horror)

Oh, my God!  The Scoleri Brothers!

JUDGE

(terrified)

You've got to do something!

VENKMAN

Who are they?

JUDGE

They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them

for murder.  They were electrocuted up at

Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.

VENKMAN

Maybe they just want to appeal.

VENKMAN

These boys aren't playing around.

JUDGE

(desperately)

You've got to stop them.  Please!

LOUIS

(thinking like a lawyer)

Violating a judicial restraining order could

expose my clients to serious criminal

penalties.  As their attorney I'd have to

advise them against it.

JUDGE

All right!  All right!  I'm recinding the

order.  Case dismissed!!

(he pounds his gavel on

the floor)

Now do something!

STANTZ

Let's go to work, boys.

VENKMAN

(slinging the pack onto

his back)

Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.

STANTZ

(grabbing other gear)

Okay, let's heat 'em up!

STANTZ

All right, throwers.  Set for full neutronas

on stream.

VENKMAN

Hey!  Why don't you pick on someone your own

size?

STANTZ

(to the others)

On my signal, boys.  Open 'em up -- Now!

VENKMAN

Spengs, take the door.  Ray, let's try and

work them down and into the corner.

STANTZ

Watch it!  I'm coming under you, Pete.

STANTZ

Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now --

Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him

down -- trapping -- trapping -- now!

VENKMAN

(checking the trap)

Occupado.

SPENGLER

(to the Prosecutor)

Brilliant summation.

VENKMAN

Case closed, boys.  We're back in business.

CUT TO:

LOUIS

What is it, honey?

JANINE

It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know

what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us

alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.

LOUIS

Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.

JANINE

Who are you going to call?

LOUIS

(with a wink)

Ghostbusters.

STANTZ

I'm Ray --

VENKMAN

I'm Peter --

SPENGLER

I'm Egon --

STANTZ

And we're the ...

ALL

(together)

Ghostbusters.

STANTZ

That's right -- Ghostbusters.  We're back

and we're better than ever with twice the

know-how and twice the particle-power to

deal with all your supernatural elimination

needs.

STANTZ

Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.

(TO CAMERA)

And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're

giving you twice the value with our special

half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.

VENKMAN

Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone

crazy?

STANTZ

I guess so, Pete, because that's not all.

Tell them what else we've got, Egon.

SPENGLER

You mean the Ghostbusters hot beverage

thermal mugs and free balloons for the kids?

STANTZ

You bet.

STANTZ

(TO CAMERA)

So don't wait another minute.  Make your

supernatural problem our supernatural problem.

Call now, because we're still --

ALL

(in unison, mechanically)

-- Ready to believe you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LOUIS

Oh, geez, smells like somebody took a really

big --

LOUIS

(screaming)

Help!  There's a thing!

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

(checking his watch)

You know he ran that last lap in under six

minutes?

STANTZ

If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic

prospect.

CUT TO:

STANTZ

(to the client)

Merry Christmas!

CUT TO:

STANTZ

(to the manager)

So will that be cash or a check?

CUT TO:

LOUIS

(shouts)

Gotcha!

LOUIS

(seeing the damage)

Uh-oh.

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

I'm looking for Dana Barrett.

SECURITY GUARD

Room 304 -- Restorations.

(recognizing him)

Hey!  Dr. Venkman -- 'World of the Psychic.'

I'm a big, big fan.  That used to be one of

my two favorite shows.

VENKMAN

(flattered)

Thanks.  What's the other one?

SECURITY GUARD

'Bass Masters.'  It's a fishing show.  Ever

see it?

VENKMAN

Yeah, really great.  Take it easy.

VENKMAN

(looking at the Ver Meer)

So this is what you do, huh?

DANA

(glad to see him)

Oh, hello, Peter.

VENKMAN

You're really good, you know.

DANA

I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it.

It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about

ten million dollars.

VENKMAN

You know you can go to Art World and get

these huge sofa-size paintings for about

forty-five bucks.

DANA

I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk

about art.

VENKMAN

As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell

you that I haven't forgotten your problem

and that we're still on the case.

JANOSZ

(smiling at Venkman)

Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to

your friend?

DANA

Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman.

Peter, Janosz Poha.

JANOSZ

(avoiding his gaze)

Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on

television.

VENKMAN

How are you?

(looking over at the Vigo

painting)

What's that you're working on, Johnny?

JANOSZ

It's a painting I'm restoring for the new

Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait

of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled

most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th

Century.

VENKMAN

(staring at the painting)

Too bad for the Moldavians.

JANOSZ

(defensive)

He was a very powerful magician.  A genius

in many ways and quite a skilled painter.

DANA

He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.

I hate this painting.  I've felt very

uncomfortable since they brought it up from

storage.

VENKMAN

Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want

to hang in the rec room.  You know what it

needs?

(picking up a brush)

A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.

JANOSZ

(with forced good will)

We don't go around altering valuable

paintings, Dr. Venkman.

VENKMAN

Well, I'd make an exception in this case if

I were you.

VENKMAN

(to Janosz)

I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting

you.

JANOSZ

My pleasure.

VENKMAN

(confidentially)

I may be wrong, but I think you've got a

little crush on this guy.

DANA

Good-bye, Peter.

VENKMAN

(dragging his feet)

I'd like to stay, but I really don't have

time to hang around here.  I'll call you.

(calls out to Janosz)

Later, Johnny!

CUT TO:

STANTZ

Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have

something really amazing to show you.

VENKMAN

(to Spengler)

It's not that thing you do with your

nostrils, is it?

STANTZ

(to Venkman)

We've been studying the stuff that we took

from the subway tunnel.

VENKMAN

And now you're going to eat it?

STANTZ

No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

STANTZ

Now watch this.

STANTZ

(simulating anger)

You worthless piece of slime!!

(as the slime starts to

twitch and glow)

You ignorant disgusting blob!!

STANTZ

You foul, obnoxious muck!!

STANTZ

I've seen some real crud in my time, but

you're a chemical disgrace!!

VENKMAN

This is what you do with your spare time?

STANTZ

(very excited)

This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman.

A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this

is, it clearly responds to human emotional

states.

VENKMAN

'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff

and sell it.

SPENGLER

We've found it at every event site we've

been to lately.

WINSTON

(poking at the slime)

You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad

vibes'?

STANTZ

Like a goat on garbage.

STANTZ

We're running tests to see if we can get an

equally strong positive reaction.

VENKMAN

What kind of tests?

STANTZ

(a little embarrassed)

Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say

supportive, nurturing things --

VENKMAN

You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?

STANTZ

It really responds to music.

(to Spengler)

Let's calm it down.

WINSTON

Does it have any favorites?

STANTZ

It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,'

'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small

World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

STANTZ

Watch this.

VENKMAN

I don't care what you say.  This could be a

major Christmas gift item.

WINSTON

Right, and the first time someone gets mad,

their toaster will eat their hand.

VENKMAN

So we'll put a warning on the label.

VENKMAN

(to the toaster)

Go ahead.  I dare you.

VENKMAN

Just kidding.

CUT TO:

DANA

(talking sweetly to the

baby)

Look at you.  I think we got more food on

your shirt than we got in your mouth.

CUT TO:

DANA

(somewhat embarrassed to

be there)

I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?

VENKMAN

(surprised to see her)

No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago.

Come on in.

(noting her apparel)

Are we having a pajama party?

DANA

(upset)

Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

VENKMAN

You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd

have serious doubts.  But coming from you,

I can't honestly say I'm surprised.

DANA

I must be losing my mind.  At the museum

today I could have sworn that terrible

painting of Vigo looked right at me.

VENKMAN

Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this

nightgown?

DANA

(distraught)

I don't know what to do anymore.

VENKMAN

I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the

bathtub.  You better stay here.

VENKMAN

Now this kid has a serious nudity problem.

VENKMAN

(to the baby)

This is Joe Namath's old number, you know.

You could get a lot of chicks with this.

Just don't pee in it.

DANA

Peter, what about the bathtub?

VENKMAN

(grabs the phone and dials)

We'll take care of that.

(on the phone)

Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right

away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one --

tried to eat the kid.

DANA

It was full of this awful pink ooze.

VENKMAN

(to Ray)

Sounds like another slime job ... No,

they're all right.  They're here now ...

Right ... Let me know.

VENKMAN

They're going over there right now.  You

might as well make yourself at home.  Let

me show you around.

(he crosses to the kitchen area)

This is the cuisine de maison --

VENKMAN

(looking at the sink)

We may have to wash some of these if you get

hungry --

(he looks in the fridge)

-- but there's no food anyway so forget

about it.  I have all kinds of carry-out

menus if you feel like ordering.

VENKMAN

Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy

up a few things.

DANA

Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have

to do any of this, you know.

VENKMAN (O.S.)

The shower works but it's a little tricky.

They're both marked "Hot."  It takes a little

practice, but at least this one won't try

and eat you.

VENKMAN

Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.

But the bed's good and I just changed the

sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In

fact, I think you should definitely plan on

spending the night here.

DANA

Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping

arrangements?

VENKMAN

For me it's best if I sleep on my side and

you spoon up right behind me with your arms

around me.  If we go the other way I'm

afraid your hair will be getting in my face

all night.

DANA

How about you on the sofa and me in bed with

the baby.

VENKMAN

Or we could do that.

DANA

Thank you.

(she picks up Oscar)

Poor baby.  I think I should put him down

now.

VENKMAN

I'll put him down for you.

(taking the baby)

You are way too short!  And your belly-button

sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to

your poor mother!

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

Did you find anything at Dana's?

STANTZ

Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in

and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up

some interesting stuff on this Vigo character

you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the

Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,

Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:

SPENGLER

(reads from xerox of entry)

"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"

VENKMAN

A hundred and five years?  He really hung

on, didn't he.

STANTZ

And he didn't die of old age either.  He was

poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,

disemboweled, drawn and quartered.

WINSTON

I guess he wasn't too popular at the end

there.

SPENGLER

No, not exactly a man of the people.

(reads)

"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the

Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the

Unholy."

STANTZ

This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in

all the Black Arts, and listen to this

prophecy.  Just before his head died, his

last words were, "Death is but a door, time

is but a window.  I'll be back."

VENKMAN

That's it?  "I'll be back?"

SPENGLER

It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.

RUDY

Hey, Dr. Venkman.  What's going on?

VENKMAN

We're just going up to Restorations for a

minute.

RUDY

Oh, I can't let you do that.  Mr. Poha told

me not to let you up there anymore.

VENKMAN

(with mock seriousness)

Okay, we were trying to keep this quiet but

I think you can be trusted.  Tell him, Ray.

STANTZ

(very official)

Mister, you have an Ecto-paritic,

subfusionary flux in this building.

RUDY

We got a flux?

WINSTON

You got a flux and a half.

STANTZ

Now if you don't want to be the --

(he counts)

-- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock

from a planar rift, I suggest you get down

behind that desk and don't move until we

give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."

JANOSZ

Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.

VENKMAN

I know.

JANOSZ

Then why have you come?

VENKMAN

We got a major creep alert and we're just

going down the list.  Your name was first.

STANTZ

(to Spengler and Winston)

Let's sweep it, boys.

VENKMAN

(to Janosz)

You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you

from, Johnny?

JANOSZ

(nervous)

The Upper West Side.

SPENGLER

(consulting his PKE meter)

This entire room is extremely hot, Peter.

JANOSZ

What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman?

VENKMAN

We'll know when we find it.  You just sit

tight.  This won't take long.

VENKMAN

This is the one that looked at Dana.

JANOSZ

It must be the chemical fumes in the studio.

People start imagining things --

VENKMAN

(interrupts)

I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing

theory.  If she says it looked at her, it

looked at her.

(to Vigo)

Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking

to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking

to you.

VENKMAN

(to Vigo)

Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby.

Just have fun with it.

(to Stantz)

Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish

up and get out of here.

STANTZ

I'll get one more reading.

WINSTON

(looking at the painting)

Now that's one ugly dude.

STANTZ

(coming back to his senses)

Huh?  What?

WINSTON

You finished here?

STANTZ

(distracted)

What?  Yeah.

WINSTON

Are you all right?  You coming down with

something?

STANTZ

No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for

a second there.  Let's go.

JANOSZ

So you see, everything is in order, is it

not?

VENKMAN

Not.  Don't leave town and report any change

in your address to the proper authorities.

We'll be back.

CUT TO:

SPENGLER

There's definitely something going on in

that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus

and the Giga-meter was showing all red.

WINSTON

I'd put my money on that Vigo character.

VENKMAN

Yeah, that's a safe bet.

(to Stantz)

You and Spengman see what else you can dig

up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.

Those two were made for each other.

STANTZ

(to another driver)

Idiot!

(honking)

Move it, you jerk!

WINSTON

Going a little fast, aren't we, Ray?

STANTZ

(viciously)

Are you telling me how to drive?

WINSTON

No, I just thought --

STANTZ

Well don't think!

WINSTON

(to Stantz, really worried

now)

Are you crazy, man?  You're going to kill

somebody!

STANTZ

No, I'm going to kill everybody!

STANTZ

(himself again)

What happened?

VENKMAN

You just picked up three penalty points on

your driver's license.

WINSTON

Are you all right?

STANTZ

Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest

thing.  I knew what I was doing but I

couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling

came over me and -- I don't know -- I just

felt like driving into that tree and ending

it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.

VENKMAN

(confidentially, to

Spengler)

Watch him, Egon.  Don't even let him shave.

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

(calls out)

I'm home!

VENKMAN

(to himself)

I knew it.  She cleaned.

VENKMAN

Are you all squeaky clean now?

DANA

(humoring him)

Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything

at my apartment?

VENKMAN

(through the door)

Nothing.  They stayed there all night, went

through your personal stuff, made a bunch of

long-distance phone calls and cleaned out

your refrigerator.  And didn't find anything.

DANA

They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub

... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do

I do now?

VENKMAN

Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a

babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you

need it.

DANA

I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar

in a strange place with someone I don't know.

VENKMAN

It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's

one of my most valuable employees.

DANA

Does she know anything about babies?

VENKMAN

Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?

(handing her the flowers)

Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your

clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I

brought along some interesting possibilities.

DANA

Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.

VENKMAN

Did you happen to see some shirts on the

floor in here?

DANA (O.S.)

I put them in your hamper.  I thought they

were dirty.

VENKMAN

(shaking his head)

I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first,

okay.  I have more than two grades of

laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels

between clean and dirty.

VENKMAN

These aren't so bad yet.  You just hang them

up for a while and they're fine.

CUT TO:

LOUIS

(to himself)

Okay, Stinky, this is it.  Showdown time.

You and me, pal.  You think you're smarter

than I am?  We'll see about that.

(loud)

Oh, hello, Pizza Man!  Oh, two larges!  I

only ordered one.  Oh, pepperoni and

pineapple.  My absolute favorite.  I guess

I'll have to eat these both by myself.

LOUIS

(quietly)

Okay, let's boogie!

LOUIS

(embarrassed and apologetic)

Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do

that.  It was an accident.

JANINE

What are you doing up here?

LOUIS

I was trying to get that smelly green thing.

The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the

fifth Ghostbuster.

JANINE

Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if

you're already an accountant?

LOUIS

Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls

in sick or gets hurt.

JANINE

Have you made any plans yet?  You know

tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

LOUIS

No, I celebrate at the beginning of my

corporate tax year which is March first.

That way I beat the crowds.

JANINE

That's very practical.  I hate going out on

New Year's Eve, too.

JANINE

Well, good night, Louis.

LOUIS

(on an impulse)

Janine, do you feel like maybe getting

something to eat on the way home?

JANINE

I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd

babysit.

(seductively)

Do you want to babysit with me?

LOUIS

Oh, sure, that sounds great.

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

(ushering them in)

Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat

barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?

STANTZ

We're going down into the sewer system to

see if we can trace the source of the

psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you

might want to come along.

VENKMAN

Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going.

I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.

SPENGLER

You know, animals and lower life forms often

anticipate major disasters.  Given the new

magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous

breeding surge in the cockroach population.

VENKMAN

Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.

(calls out)

Dana?  The boys are going down under the

sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon

thinks there might even be some kind of big

roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about

dinner and go with them instead?

STANTZ

Wow.

DANA

Hi.

VENKMAN

(to Ray and Egon)

I think we're going to have to pass on the

sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find

out.

STANTZ

(on his exit)

Okay, but you're missing all the fun.

STANTZ

This is it.  Van Horne Station.  Right where

the old transit map said it would be.

STANTZ

Let's get a sounding on the depth of that

flow.

STANTZ

Stand back.

SPENGLER

Six feet -- seven -- eight --

STANTZ

That's it.  It's on the bottom.

SPENGLER

Nine feet -- ten --

WINSTON

Is the line sinking?

SPENGLER

No, the slime is rising.

STANTZ

(alarmed)

Let's get out of here, boys.

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

(very intimate)

Here's to -- us.

VENKMAN

So -- are you making any New Year's

resolutions?

DANA

I want to stop getting involved with men who

aren't good for me.

VENKMAN

Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow,

or could you hold off for a few days maybe?

DANA

For one night in your life, do you think

it's possible for us to be completely real?

VENKMAN

All right, you want to be real?  So tell me

why did you dump me?

DANA

Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had

to protect myself.  You really weren't very

good for me, you know.

VENKMAN

I'm not even good for me.

DANA

Why do you say things like that?  You're so

much better than you know.

VENKMAN

Thank you.  If I had that kind of support

on a daily basis, I could definitely shape

up by the turn of the century.

DANA

(already feeling the

effects of the champagne)

So why don't you give me a jingle in the

year 2000?

VENKMAN

Let me jingle you right now.

DANA

Maybe I should call Janine.

VENKMAN

Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way

with children.

CUT TO:

JANINE

(looking around)

I can't believe a person could actually live

like this.

LOUIS

(to the baby)

So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in

a small mining operation and then one day a

beautiful princess came to live with them.

JANINE

It's really not a bad place.  It just needs

a woman's touch.

LOUIS

(continuing)

So they bartered room and board in exchange

for housekeeping services, which was a good

deal for all of them because then they didn't

have to withhold tax and social security,

which I'm not saying is right but it's just

a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can

finish this later if you're tired.

JANINE

You're really good with children, Louis.  I

can tell.

(as he returns)

Why don't you come here and sit with me?

LOUIS

Okay.

JANINE

(getting close)

Motherhood is a very natural instinct for

me.  I'd like to have a baby myself.

Wouldn't you?

LOUIS

(gulps)

Tonight?

WINSTON

(uncharacteristically

angry)

Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to

do -- drown me?

STANTZ

(unusually mean)

Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were

too stupid to drop that line.

WINSTON

(shoves him)

You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll

punch your lights out.

STANTZ

Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead

and try it.

SPENGLER

If you two are looking for a fight, you got

one.

(putting up his fists)

Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me,

sucker.

STANTZ

(squaring off)

Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had

it with you.

SPENGLER

(forcefully)

Strip!  Right now!  Get out of those clothes!

WINSTON

What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill

you.

STANTZ

Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff

is like pure, concentrated evil.

SPENGLER

And it's all flowing right to this spot.

CUT TO:

MAITRE D'

(intercepting them)

Can I help you?

STANTZ

That's all right, I see him.

STANTZ

(very excited)

You should've been there, Venkman.

Absolutely incredible!

VENKMAN

Yeah, sorry I missed it.

(noting their attire)

I guess you guys didn't know about the dress

code here.  It's really kind of a coat and

tie place.

STANTZ

It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under

it actually.

WINSTON

Rivers of the stuff!

SPENGLER

And it's all flowing toward the museum.

STANTZ

(calls out)

Sorry!

DANA

Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.

VENKMAN

(confidentially)

Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights.

Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?

SPENGLER

(to Venkman)

This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman.

It's hot and it's ready to pop.

MAITRE D'

Arrest these men.

COP

(recognizing them)

Hey!  It's the Ghostbusters.  You're out of

uniform, gentlemen

STANTZ

(self-conscious)

Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but

forget that.  We have to see the mayor as

soon as possible.

COP

Look, Doc, why don't you just go home.

You'll get a good night's sleep and then you

can give the mayor a call in the morning.

Come on.

STANTZ

We're not going anywhere with you.  I told

you we have to see the mayor now.

COP

(grabbing Stantz)

I'm warning you.  You can come along

peaceably or --

VENKMAN

(grabs the Cop)

Hey, don't be an idiot.  This is serious.

COP

(angry)

Look, pal, keep this up and you're going

with them.

VENKMAN

Oh, yeah?

COP

(has had enough)

Yeah, let's go.  You're all under arrest.

VENKMAN

(to Dana)

Finish your dessert -- it's already paid

for.  I'll call you.

SPENGLER

Look, we're not drunk and we're not crazy.

This is a matter of vital importance.

COP

What are you doing?

VENKMAN

I just want to get your names right for when

the mayor asks us why we didn't let him know

about this sooner.

COP

(relenting)

Okay, Doc.  You want to see the mayor, you

got it.  Follow us.

CUT TO:

LOUIS

(embarrassed)

Oh, hello, Dana.  we were just -- we were --

DANA

I know what you were doing, Louis.  It's

all right.

JANINE

How was your date?

DANA

Typical.  Peter was arrested.  Has he called?

LOUIS

No, nobody called.

DANA

Is everything all right with Oscar?

JANINE

Oh, he's fine.  He's such a good baby.  He

was a little fussy at first, but we gave

him a Freach bread pizza and he went right

to sleep.

DANA

(relieved)

Oh, good.  I'll just check on him.

LOUIS

Should we go?

JANINE

I don't think we should leave her alone.

LOUIS

You're right.  We should stay.

CUT TO:

VIGO

I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --

JANOSZ

(heard all this before)

Yes, the scourge --

VIGO

-- the sorrow of Moldavia --

JANOSZ

-- the sorrow --

VIGO

I command you.

JANOSZ

(checking his watch)

I await the word of Vigo.

VIGO

The season of evil begins with the birth of

the new year.  Bring me the child that I

might live again.

JANOSZ

(abjectly humble)

Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and

strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it

be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I

have the woman?

VIGO

So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she

will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.

CUT TO:

MAYOR

All right -- the Ghostbusters.  I'll tell

you right now; I've got two hundred of the

heaviest campaign contributors in the city

out there eating bad roast chicken waiting

for me to give the speech of my life.

You've got two minutes.  Make it good.

STANTZ

You get enough negative energy flowing in a

dense environment like Manhattan, it starts

to build up, and if we don't do something

fast this whole place will blow like a frog

on a hotplate.

WINSTON

Tell him about the toaster.

VENKMAN

I don't think he's ready for the toaster.

MAYOR

(shaking his head)

Being miserable and treating other people

like dirt is every New Yorker's God-given

right.  What am I supposed to do -- go on

television and tell eight million people

they have to be nice to each other?  I'm

sorry, none of this makes any sense to me,

and if anything does happen we've got plenty

of paid professionals to deal with it.  Your

two minutes are up.  Good night, gentlemen.

HARDEMEYER

(smirking)

That's quite a story.

VENKMAN

Yeah, I think the Times might be interested,

don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun

with it, too.

HARDEMEYER

Before you go running to the newspapers with

this, would you consider telling this slime

thing to some people downtown?

VENKMAN

Now you're talking.

CUT TO:

WINSTON

(protesting)

I'm telling you, we're not crazy.  He is!

HARDEMEYER

(to the Psychiatrist)

The mayor wants them kept under strict

observation for a few days.  We think

they're seriously disturbed and potentially

dangerous.

PSYCHIATRIST

We'll do whatever's necessary.

DANA

(wishing they'd leave)

You know you really don't have to stay.

Peter should be back soon.

LOUIS

Oh no, we don't mind.

DANA

Excuse me.  I think Oscar is up.

DANA

(screams)

Louis!

DANA

(screams)

No!!

DANA

(resolutely)

Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him

what happened.

LOUIS

(confused and worried)

Where're you going?

DANA

To get my baby back.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

STANTZ

We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian

is alive in a painting at the Manhattan

Museum.

PSYCHIATRIST

I see. And are there any other paintings in

the museum with bad spirits in them?

SPENGLER

(impatient)

You're wasting valuable time!  We have reason

to believe that Vigo is drawing strength from

a psychomagnetheric slime flow that's been

collecting under the city.

PSYCHIATRIST

Yes, tell me about the slime.

WINSTON

It's potent stuff.  We made a toaster dance

with it, then a bathtub tried to eat his

friend's baby.

VENKMAN

Don't look at me.  I think they're nuts.

CUT TO:

JANOSZ (O.S.)

I knew you would come.

DANA

(defiantly)

What do you want with my baby?

JANOSZ

No harm will come to the child.  You might

even say it's a privilege.  He will be the

vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you --

well, you will be the mother of the ruler

of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?

DANA

If this is what the world will be like, I

don't want to live in it.

JANOSZ

(confidentially, indicating

Vigo)

I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.

DANA

Everybody has a choice.

JANOSZ

Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look.

That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there.

He's Vigo!

DANA

I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my

baby.

JANOSZ

You will see.  It's all for the best.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

STANTZ

This is it. boys.  It's starting.  Shit-storm

2000.

VENKMAN

It better not start yet.  I'm trying to

finish my potholder before lunch.

WINSTON

You think all those predictions about the

world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?

PATIENT

(with certainty)

1997.  My dog told me.

VENKMAN

What kind of dog?

PATIENT

Labrador.

VENKMAN

(shakes his head)

Habitual liars.  They can't help it.  It's

in the breed.

CUT TO:

LOUIS

Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this

for me.  I'm begging you.

SHERMAN

I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I

could lose my license.

LOUIS

Why can't you just have them released?

You're a doctor.

SHERMAN

I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders

on the psych ward.

LOUIS

Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.

SHERMAN

Like what?

LOUIS

I got you out of those bad tax shelters.

SHERMAN

You were the one who got me in.

LOUIS

I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she

put out, didn't she?

SHERMAN

Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion

for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get

in a lot of trouble.

LOUIS

I'm telling you, we're all going to be in

big trouble if we don't do something fast.

That ghost guy came and took my friend's

baby and we got to get it back.  It's just

a scared little baby, Sherm.

SHERMAN

Then you should go to the police.  I don't

believe in any of that stuff.

LOUIS

(spooky)

Do you believe it now, Sherm?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WOMAN

(shrewish)

I told you we should have stayed in Palm

Beach.  The weather here gets stranger every

year.

MAN

Yes, dear.

WOMAN

(to the doorman)

Something just bit me!

CUT TO:

DETECTIVE ONE

(on the phone)

Look, lady, of course there are dead people

there.  It's a cemetery ...

(his face falls)

They were asking you for directions?

DETECTIVE TWO

(on another phone)

Was this a big dinosaur or a little dinosaur?

... Oh, just the skeleton, huh?  Well, where

is it now?

DETECTIVE THREE

(on the phone)

Wait a second -- the park bench was chasing

you?  You mean, someone was chasing you in

the park ... No, the bench itself was chasing

you.  I see --

SERGEANT

Manhattan Central, Flaherty speaking ...

Yeah ... yeah? ... What?  Who is this? ...

Wait a second.

SERGEANT

Lieutenant, I think you better talk to this

guy.

LIEUTENANT

(on another call)

What is it?  I'm talkin' here!

SERGEANT

It's some dock supervisor down at Pier 34

on the Hudson.  The guy's going nuts.

LIEUTENANT

What's the problem?

SERGEANT

(takes a deep breath)

He says the Titanic just arrived.

CUT TO:

STANTZ

Good work, Louis.  How did you get us out?

LOUIS

Oh, I pulled a few strings.  I wouldn't want

to say any more than that.

LOUIS

This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello

to the Ghostbusters.

(sotto voce to Stantz)

I promised him a ride in the car if he got

you out.

SHERMAN

(to the Ghostbusters)

Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I

know this sounds weird but once I had a

dream that my grandfather was standing at

the foot of my bed, but I knew it was

impossible because he died and he started

to tell me that --

LOUIS

Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.

SHERMAN

I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.

LOUIS

I let them handle all the little stuff.  I

just come in on the big ones.

CUT TO:

LOUIS

Actually, they still think you're crazy, but

I convinced them you're not dangerous.

VENKMAN

(determined)

Yeah, well guess again.

LOUIS

I brought everything you asked for and I

gassed up the car with Super Unleaded.  It

cost twenty cents more than Regular Unleaded

but you get much better performance and in

an old car like this that'll end up saving

you money in the long run.  I put it on my

credit card, so you can either reimburse me

or I can take it out of petty cash --

LOUIS

Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.

CUT TO:

STANTZ

It looks like a giant Jello mold.

VENKMAN

I hate Jello.

STANTZ

(to the Fire Captain)

Okay, give it a rest, Captain.  We'll take

it from here.

FIRE CAPTAIN

(skeptical)

Be my guest.  We been cutting here for three

hours.  What the hell's going on?  You know

the Titanic arrived this morning?

VENKMAN

Well, better late than never.

SPENGLER

(monitoring valences)

Full neutronas, maser assist.

STANTZ

Throw 'em!

VENKMAN

(to the firemen)

Okay, who knows "Cumbaya?"

VENKMAN

All right.  Nice and sweet --

(starts singing)

Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya --

ALL

(singing)

Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord,

cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya.

STANTZ

Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't

get through this stuff.

VENKMAN

Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say

supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?

SPENGLER

It won't work.  There's no way we could

generate enough positive energy to crack

that shell.

STANTZ

I can't believe things have gotten so bad

in this city that there's no way back.

Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy.

And there are too many people who'd just as

soon step on your face as look at you.  But

there've got to be a few sparks of sweet

humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We

just have to mobilize it.

SPENGLER

We need something that everyone can get

behind, a symbol --

STANTZ

(he sees it, too)

Something that appeals to the best in each

and every one of us --

SPENGLER

Something good --

VENKMAN

And pure --

WINSTON

And decent.

HARDEMEYER

Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff

together, get back in that clown car and get

out of here.  This is a city matter and

everything's under control.

VENKMAN

Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for

you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law

in there and he's got my girlfriend and her

kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when

you're partying uptown, this guy's going to

come to life and start doing amateur head

transplants.  And that's just round one.

MAYOR

Are you telling me there're people trapped

in there?

HARDEMEYER

(to his assistant)

This is dynamite.  Call A.P., U.P.I., and

C.N.N. and get them down here right away.

When the police bring this kid out I want

them to hand it right to the mayor and I

want it all on camera.

STANTZ

Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by

midnight, you're going to go down in history

as the man who let New York get sucked down

into the tenth level of hell.

MAYOR

(to the Fire Captain)

Can you get into that museum?

FIRE CAPTAIN

If I had a nuclear warhead, maybe.

MAYOR

You know why all these things are happening?

VENKMAN

We tried to tell you last night, but Mr.

Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony

bin.

HARDEMEYER

This is preposterous!  You can't seriously

believe all this mumbo-jumbo!  It's the

Twentieth Century, for crying out loud!

(viciously, to Venkman)

Look, mister, I don't know what this stuff

is or how you got it all over the museum,

but you better get it off and I mean right

now!

MAYOR

(to Venkman)

Okay, just tell me what you need.

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

WINSTON

Wonder what?

VENKMAN

If she's naked under that toga.  She's

French, you know.

SPENGLER

There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons

of iron and steel.

STANTZ

I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.

VENKMAN

Only one way to find out.

(to Stantz)

Ready, Teddy?

CUT TO:

STANTZ

Okay, boys.  Let's frost it.

CUT TO:

JANINE

I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do

they know you're doing this?

LOUIS

Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really

not much to do here and they might need

some back-up at the museum.

JANINE

You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.

LOUIS

Uh -- oh -- well, I better hurry.

CUT TO:

STANTZ

It's all yours, Pete.

(checks his watch)

There's not much time left.

VENKMAN

(giving the downbeat)

Okay, one, two, three, four --

STANTZ

She's moving!

WINSTON

I've lived in New York all my life and I

never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I

finally get here and we're taking her out

for a walk.

SPENGLER

(reading the Giga-meter)

We've got full power.

VENKMAN

(into a microphone)

Okay, Libby.  Let's get it in gear.

CUT TO:

WINSTON

How deep does it get?  That water's cold and

I can't swim.

VENKMAN

It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.

SPENGLER

With a water temperature of forty degrees

we'd survive approximately fifteen minutes.

STANTZ

I'll keep to the middle of the channel.

We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go

ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.

VENKMAN

Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge

traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd

straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to

drive a cab.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JANOSZ

Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be

midnight and the city will be mine -- and

Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have

a spectacular opportunity to make the best

of our relationship.

DANA

We don't have a relationship.

JANOSZ

I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we

will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many

perks that come with being the mother of a

living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us

a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car

and free parking.

DANA

I hate and despise you and everything you

stand for with all my heart and soul.  I

could never forgive what you've done to me

and my child.

JANOSZ

Many marriages begin with a certain amount

of distance, but after a while I believe we

could learn to love each other.  Think about

it.

DANA

I'd rather not.

CUT TO:

SPENGLER

It's working.  The positive GeV's are

climbing.

VENKMAN

(patting the Statue)

They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

So far so good.

SPENGLER

(worried)

I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her

to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.

STANTZ

I don't think they make Nikes in her size.

VENKMAN

We're almost there, Lib.

(to Stantz)

Step on it.

STANTZ

(shouts out the window)

My Fault!

VENKMAN

(shouts)

She's new in town.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CROWD

(chanting)

Ten .. nine ... eight ... seven ...

CUT TO:

VIGO

Soon my life begins.  Then woe to the weak,

all power to me, the world is mine.

VENKMAN

(to Janosz)

Happy New Year.

SPENGLER

Hi there.  Feel free to try something stupid.

JANOSZ

You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare

to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't

you realize what you are dealing with?  He's

Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to

him.

VENKMAN

(sighs)

Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.

STANTZ

Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad

little monkey.

VENKMAN

The whole city's together on this one.  We

took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you

know.

WINSTON

(arming his slime-blower)

Say goodnight now.

SPENGLER

Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!

STANTZ

(strangling)

Do it!  Just do it!

SPENGLER

(examining him)

He's breathing.

WINSTON

Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?

STANTZ

(smiles lovingly)

Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.

VENKMAN

Oh, no.  We've got to live with this?

STANTZ

I love you guys.  You're the best friends

I've ever had.

VENKMAN

Hey, I just had this suit cleaned.

(indicating Janosz)

Take care of the wiggler, will you.

VENKMAN

What is this -- a love in?

(notes the symbols painted

on the baby's body)

Hey, sailor.  I think the tattoos are a

little much, don't you?

DANA

(to Venkman)

I think he likes you.  I think I do too.

VENKMAN

Finally came to your senses, huh?

JANOSZ

(restored to normalcy)

What happened?

STANTZ

(calmly)

Sir, you had a violent, prolonged,

transformative psychic episode.  But it's

over now.  Want a coffee?

JANOSZ

(extremely nice)

That's very kind of you.

SPENGLER

(to Stantz)

He's fine, Ray.  Physically intact,

psychomagnetherically neutral.

JANOSZ

Is that good?

WINSTON

It's where you want to be.

SPENGLER

Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or

Brunelleschi.

WINSTON

(staring at it)

There's something very familiar about this

painting.

CUT TO:

LOUIS

(to Slimer)

Okay, so Monday night we'll get something

to eat and maybe go bowling?  Can you bowl

with those little arms?

LOUIS

Okay, I have to go save Dana.  I'll see you

later.

CUT TO:

LOUIS

Am I too late?

STANTZ

No, you're right on time.

HARDEMEYER

(weepy)

Happy New Year, everybody!

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

She's all right.  She's just sleeping it off.

MAYOR

(stricken)

We just had it restored.

VENKMAN

This probably isn't a good time to bring

this up, but the last time we did a job for

the city you stiffed us.

STANTZ

(handing the Mayor an

invoice)

This is a bill for tonight's job.

MAYOR

What!  This is way too much.

(hands the bill back to

Venkman)

We won't pay.

VENKMAN

(to Stantz)

I think she looks pretty good here, don't

you?

STANTZ

Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.

MAYOR

All right, all right.  If you can wait until

Monday I'll issue you a check.

SPENGLER

Sorry.  No checks.  Company policy.

CUT TO:

VENKMAN

(looking up at the statue)

Pretty impressive, huh?

SPENGLER

(musing)

It's probably the first thing my

grandparents saw when they came to this

country.

VENKMAN

From where -- Neptune?

SPENGLER

They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.

VENKMAN

Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.

STANTZ

(in a similarly reflective

mood)

My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still

have the pictures they took of the statue

from the boat when they arrived.

VENKMAN

Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to

America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I

recall.  How about you, Winston?

WINSTON

My people weren't taking any pictures from

those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't

any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome

them, either.  What are you, Dana?

VENKMAN

Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here

since the year 12.

DANA

That's not true.  It was 1620.

VENKMAN

Same difference.

STANTZ

What's your story, Pete?

VENKMAN

Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish,

some German, some French, Dutch -- the women

in my family slept around.  And that's what

made this country great.

DANA

That's a terrible thing to say.

VENKMAN

So what?  It's a free country.

(looking up at the Statue)

Thanks, Lib.

FADE OUT.

THE END
