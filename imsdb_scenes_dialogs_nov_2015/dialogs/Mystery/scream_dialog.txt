CASEY

Hello.

MAN'S VOICE

(from phone)

Hello.

CASEY

Yes.

MAN

Who is this?

CASEY

Who are you trying to reach?

MAN

What number is this?

CASEY

What number are you trying to reach?

MAN

I don't know.

CASEY

I think you have the wrong number.

MAN

Do I?

CASEY

It happens. Take it easy.

CASEY

Hello.

MAN

I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.

CASEY

So why did you dial it again?

MAN

To apologize.

CASEY

You're forgiven. Bye now.

MAN

Wait, wait, don't hang up.

CASEY

What?

MAN

I want to talk to you for a second.

CASEY

They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.

CASEY

Hello.

MAN

Why don't you want to talk to me?

CASEY

Who is this?

MAN

You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

CASEY

(shaking the popcorn)

I don't think so.

MAN

What's that noise?

CASEY

Popcorn.

MAN

You're making popcorn?

CASEY

Uh-huh.

MAN

I only eat popcorn at the movies.

CASEY

I'm getting ready to watch a video.

MAN

Really? What?

CASEY

Just some scary movie.

MAN

Do you like scary movies?

CASEY

Uh-huh.

MAN

What's your favorite scary movie?

CASEY

I don't know.

MAN

You have to have a favorite.

CASEY

Uh...HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the

guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around

and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?

MAN

Guess.

CASEY

Uh...NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.

MAN

Is that the one where the guy had knives

for fingers?

CASEY

Yeah...Freddy Krueger.

MAN

Freddy-that's right. I liked that movie.

It was scary.

CASEY

The first one was, but the rest sucked.

MAN

So, you gotta boyfriend?

CASEY

(giggling)

Why? You wanna ask me out?

MAN

Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

CASEY

No.

MAN

You never told me your name.

CASEY

Why do you want to know my name?

MAN

Because I want to know who I'm looking

at.

CASEY

What did you say?

MAN

I want to now who I'm talking to.

CASEY

That's not what you said.

MAN

What do you think I said?

CASEY

I have to go now.

MAN

Wait...I thought we were gonna go out.

CASEY

Nah, I don't think so...

MAN

Don't hang up on me.

CASEY

Gotta go.

MAN

Don't...

CASEY

Yes?

MAN

I told you not to hang up on me.

CASEY

What do you want?

MAN

To talk.

CASEY

Dial someone else, okay?

MAN

You getting scared?

CASEY

No-bored.

CASEY

Listen, asshole...

MAN

(deadly serious)

NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU

HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE

A FISH. UNDERSTAND?

CASEY

Is this some kind of a joke?

MAN

More of a game, really.

CASEY

I'm two seconds from calling the police.

MAN

They'd never make it in time.

CASEY

What do you want?

MAN

(pure evil)

TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.

CASEY

(calling out)

Who's there?

CASEY

(louder)

Who's there?

MAN

You should never say "Who's there?".

Don't you watch scary movies? It's a

death wish.

CASEY

Look, enough is enough. You had your fun

now you better leave me alone or else.

MAN

Or else what?

CASEY

My boyfriend will be here any second and

he'll be pissed when I tell him...

MAN

I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.

CASEY

I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll

be here any second and your ass better

be gone.

MAN

Sure...

CASEY

I swear it. And he's big and plays

football and will beat the shit out

of you.

MAN

I'm getting scared.

CASEY

I'm telling you the truth.

I lied before...

MAN

I believe you...

CASEY

So you better leave.

MAN

His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?

CASEY

How do you know his name?

MAN

Go to the back door and turn on the porch

light--again.

CASEY

Oh Goddddd...

MAN

I wouldn't do that if I were you.

CASEY

Where are you?

MAN

Guess.

CASEY

(begging)

Please don't hurt him.

MAN

That all depends on you.

CASEY

Why are you doing this?

MAN

I wanna play a game.

CASEY

No...

MAN

Then he dies. Right now.

CASEY

NOOO!

MAN

Which is it?

CASEY

What kind of game?

MAN

Turn off the light.

MAN

Here's how we play. I ask a question. If

you get it right-Steve lives.

CASEY

Please don't do this...

MAN

Come on. It'll be fun.

CASEY

No...please.

MAN

It's an easy category. Movie trivia.

CASEY

(begging)

..please...

MAN

I'll even give you a warm up question.

CASEY

Don't do this. I can't..

MAN

Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.

CASEY

No...

MAN

Come on. It's you favorite scary movie,

remember? He had a white mask, he

stalked the baby-sitters.

CASEY

I don't know...

MAN

Come on, yes you do.

CASEY

Please..stop...

MAN

What's his name?

CASEY

I can't think.

MAN

Steve's counting on you.

CASEY

(a whisper)

Michael...Michael Myers.

MAN

YES!

MAN

Now for the real question.

CASEY

NOOOO....

MAN

But you're doing so well.

CASEY

Please go away! Leave us alone!

MAN

Then answer the question. Same category.

CASEY

..please..no...

MAN

Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.

CASEY

Jason! Jason!...JASON!

MAN

I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.

CASEY

No it's not. It was Jason.

MAN

Afraid not.

CASEY

It was Jason. I saw that godamned movie

twenty times. It was Jason.

MAN

Then you should know Jason's MOTHER

-Mrs.Vorhees was the original killer. Jason

didn't show up until the sequel.

CASEY

You tricked me...

MAN

Lucky, for you there's a bonus round.

But poor Steve...I'm afraid...he's out.

MAN

Final question. Are you ready?

CASEY

..leave me alone..please...

MAN

Answer the question and I will.

MAN

What door am I at?

CASEY

What?

MAN

There are two doors to your house. A

front door and a back one. If you answer

correctly-you live.

CASEY

Don't make me...I can't...I won't.

MAN

Your call.

MAN

I can hear you. I know you're here.

FATHER

That fish smelled strong.

MOTHER

I told you to send it back.

FATHER

Jesus...

MOTHER

What is it? Where's Casey?

FATHER

(calling out)

Casey? Casey?

MOTHER

Where is she?

FATHER

Call the police.

FATHER

(searching)

Casey? Where are you honey? Call the

police, goddammit.

MOTHER

The phone's dead.

CASEY

(from phone)

..help me...

MOTHER

She's here, God, I can hear her.

Where's my baby?

FATHER

Where is she?

MOTHER

I can hear her. Oh Mother of God,

I can hear her.

FATHER

Casey! Casey!

MOTHER

Not my daughter...not my...

FATHER

Get in the car and drive down to

the Mackenzie's.

VOICE

(o.c.)

Hey...it's just me.

SIDNEY

Billy? What the...

BILLY

I'm sorry. Don't hate me.

SIDNEY

What are you doing here?

BILLY

You sleep in THAT?

SIDNEY

(whispering)

My dad's in the other room.

BILLY

I'll only stay a sec.

VOICE

(from behind door)

What's going on in there?

MR. PRESCOTT

Are you okay?

SIDNEY

Can you knock?

MR. PRESCOTT

I heard screaming.

SIDNEY

No you didn't.

MR. PRESCOTT

No? Oh, well...I'm hitting the sack. My

flight leaves first thing in the morning.

Now the expo runs all weekend so I

won't be back til Sunday. There's cash

on the table and I'll be staying at the

Raleigh Hilton...

SIDNEY

..out at the airport...

MR. PRESCOTT

..so call if you need me.

SIDNEY

Got it.

MR. PRESCOTT

I coulda swore I heard screaming.

SIDNEY

Have a good trip.

MR. PRESCOTT

Sleep tight, sweetie.

BILLY

Close call.

SIDNEY

What are you doing here?

BILLY

It just occurred to me that I've never

snuck through your bedroom window.

SIDNEY

Now that it's out of your system.

BILLY

And I was home, bored, watching

television, THE EXORCIST was on

and it got me thinking of you.

SIDNEY

Oh it did?

BILLY

Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good

stuff was cut out and I started thinking

about us and how two years ago, we started

off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R"

rating on our way to an NC17. And how

things have changed and, lately, we're just

sot of...edited for television.

SIDNEY

So you thought you could sneak in my

window and we would  have little bump-

bump.

BILLY

No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your

underwear rule. I just thought we might do

some on top of the clothes stuff.

SIDNEY

Time to go, stud bucket.

BILLY

See what you do to me.

SIDNEY

You know what my dad will do to you?

BILLY

I'm going...I'm going.

SIDNEY

I appreciate the romantic gesture.

BILLY

(whisper)

Hey..about the sex stuff. I'm not trying

to rush you. I was only half serious.

SIDNEY

Would you settle for a PG-13

relationship?

BILLY

What's that?

SIDNEY

Get outa here.

DISC JOCKEY

(from radio)

..found brutally murdered...

GALE

(for the camera)

The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina

was devastated last night when two young

teenagers were found brutally butchered.

Authorities have yet to issue a statement

but our sources tell us that no arrest

has been made and the murderer could

strike again...

TATUM

Do you believe this shit?

SIDNEY

What happened?

TATUM

Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker

and Steve Forrest were killed last night.

SIDNEY

No way.

TATUM

And not just killed, Sid. We're talking

splatter movie killed-split open end to

end.

SIDNEY

Casey Becker? She sits next to me in

English.

TATUM

Not anymore. Her parents found her

hanging from a tree. Her insides on the

outside.

SIDNEY

Do they know who did it?

TATUM

Fucking clueless-they're interrogating

the entire school. Teachers, students,

staff, janitors...

SIDNEY

They think it's school-related?

TATUM

They don't know. Dewey said this is

the worst crime they've ever seen.

Even worse than...

(stopping herself)

Well it's bad. They're bringing in the

feds. This is big.

MRS. TATE

..a terrible tragedy. An unbearable

loss. It's days like today we need

prayer in school...

MRS. TATE

Sidney. It appears to be your turn.

SHERIFF BURKE

Who's up next?

DEWEY

Sidney Prescott.

MR. HIMBRY

Sidney Prescott. She was daughter of...

DEWEY

We all know Sidney, Mr. Himbry.

SHERIFF BURKE

How she doin'?

MR. HIMBRY

She's adjusted well. Maintains an "A"

average. You never know she...

SHERIFF BURKE

Hi Sidney.

SIDNEY

Sheriff Burke. Dewey.

DEWEY

It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

SHERIFF BURKE

How is everything?

SIDNEY

Good.

SHERIFF BURKE

And your Dad? How's he doing?

SIDNEY

We're fine. Thanks.

MR. HIMBRY

We'll be brief, Sidney. The police have a

few questions they'd like to ask you...

TATUM

Hunt? Why would they ask if you like

to hunt?

STU

I don't know, they just did.

RANDY

Because their bodies were gutted.

BILLY

Thanks Randy.

TATUM

They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

STU

Because there's no way a girl could have

killed them.

TATUM

That is so sexist. The killer could

easily be female-BASIC INSTINCT.

RANDY

That was an ice pick-not exactly the

same.

STU

Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely

hollowed out. Takes a man to do

something like that.

TATUM

Or a man's mentality.

SIDNEY

(quiet, almost to herself)

How do you gut someone?

STU

You take a knife and slit from the groin

to the sternum.

STU

What? She asked.

BILLY

It's called tact, you fuckrag.

STU

Sorry.

RANDY

Remember in JAWS when they caught the

wrong shark at first and Richard Dreyfuss

cut it open to look foe body parts and all

they found was a licence plate and all this

white milky goo.

STU

You heard Billy-shut the fuck up.

SIDNEY

Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?

STU

For about two seconds.

RANDY

Before she dumped him foe Steve.

TATUM

I thought you dumped her for me.

STU

I did. He's full of shit.

RANDY

And are the police aware you dated the

victim?

STU

(offended)

What are you saying? That I killed

her or something?

RANDY

It would certainly improve your high

school Q.

TATUM

Stu was with me last night.

RANDY

Oooooh...before or after he sliced and

diced.

TATUM

Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last

night?

RANDY

Working, thank you.

TATUM

I thought Blockbuster fired you.

RANDY

Twice.

STU

I didn't kill anybody.

BILLY

No one's saying you did.

RANDY

Besides-

(perfect Stu mimic)

"Takes a man to do something like that."

STU

I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.

RANDY

(to Stu)

Did you really put her liver in the

mailbox? I hear they found her liver

in the mailbox.

TATUM

(eyeing Sidney)

Randy, you goon-fuck, I'm eating here.

STU

Yeah, Randy, she's getting mad. I think

you better liver alone.

SIDNEY

(into phone)

You sure I can stay over?  My dad won't

be back til Sunday.

TATUM

(through phone)

No prob. I'll pick you up after

practice.

SIDNEY

Tell your mom I said thanks.

TATUM

Yeah, yeah...are you okay?

SIDNEY

Uh-huh, it's just...you know, the police

and reporters...it brings it all back.

TATUM

I'll be there by seven. I promise

SIDNEY

Thanks, Tatum.

TATUM

Later.

REPORTER #1

(on TV)

The entire nation was shocked today by

the teen murders in North Carolina...

REPORTER #2

The State Bureau of Investigation has

joined forces with local authorities to

help catch what the Governor has called

the most heinous...

GALE

This is not the first time the small town

of Bayboro has endured such tragedy. Only

a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and

mother, was found raped and murdered...

TATUM

(from phone)

Practice ran late. I'm on my way.

SIDNEY

(eyes clock)

It's past seven.

TATUM

Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite

it til way after ten.

SIDNEY

I'm not worried.

TATUM

Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER

and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in

ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you

pause it just right you can see his penis.

SIDNEY

Whatever. Just hurry.

TATUM

Bye.

SIDNEY

(into phone)

Tatum?

MAN'S VOICE

(from phone)

Hello, Sidney.

SIDNEY

Hi. Who is this?

MAN

You tell me.

SIDNEY

I have no idea.

MAN

Scary night, isn't it? With the murders

and all, it's like right out of a horror

movie or something.

SIDNEY

Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are

you calling from work? Tatum's on her

way over.

MAN

Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

SIDNEY

I like that thing you're doing with your

voice, Randy. It's sexy.

MAN

What's your favorite scary movie?

SIDNEY

Don't start. You know I don't watch that

shit.

MAN

And why is that?

SIDNEY

(playing along)

Because they're all the same. It's

always some stupid killer stalking some

big breasted girl-who can't act-who

always runs up the stairs when she should

be going out the front door. They're

ridiculous.

MAN

Are you alone in the house?

SIDNEY

That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me,

Randy.

MAN

Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.

SIDNEY

So who are you?

MAN

The question is not who am I. The

question is where am I?

SIDNEY

So where are you?

MAN

Your front porch.

SIDNEY

Why would you call me from my

front porch?

MAN

That's the original part.

SIDNEY

Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff.

SIDNEY

So where are you?

MAN

Right here.

SIDNEY

Can you see me right now?

MAN

Uh-huh.

SIDNEY

What am I doing?

SIDNEY

Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry.

Bye now.

MAN

If you hang up, you'll die just like your

mother.

MAN

(deadly)

Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother

didn't.

SIDNEY

FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN!

FAX MODEM

9-1-1 SEND

HELP KILLER

34 ELM ST

"Stay calm.  Police enroute."

SIDNEY

Oh Billy...Please...God...

BILLY

I heard screaming. The door was locked.

Are you okay...

SIDNEY

He's here. He's trying to kill me...

BILLY

Hey...wait...what's goin..

BILLY

(screaming)

I didn't do anything! Sid...where's Sid?

Ask her, she'll tell ya...

DEWEY

We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.

SHERIFF BURKE

Hank Loomis' kid? Aw..Jesus...

DEWEY

He's her boyfriend.

BILLY

Sheriff...I didn't do it...please, call

my Dad..please...

DEWEY

I was first to respond.

SHERIFF BURKE

What were you doing out here?

DEWEY

Drive by patrol.

SHERIFF BURKE

How is she?

DEWEY

She's tough.

SHERIFF BURKE

Have to be. The shit she's gone through.

SHERIFF BURKE

We're seeing a lot of you today.

DEWEY

You gonna be able to come down to the

station and talk to us a bit?

SIDNEY

..yeah...

TATUM

What happened? Oh God...

DEWEY

(to Tatum)

What are you doing here?

TATUM

Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.

DEWEY

You can't be here, Tatum. This is an

official crime scene.

SIDNEY

It's okay. She was supposed to pick me

up.

TATUM

Her dad's out of town. She's staying

with us.

DEWEY

Does mom know?

TATUM

Yes, you doofus.

SHERIFF BURKE

The vultures are coming. Let's get you

out of here.

GALE

I'll be damned.

KENNY

What? What?

GALE

Jesus! The camera-hurry!

GALE

Excuse me?

GALE

Was that Sidney Prescott they took away?

TATUM

I don't know.

GALE

What happened to her?

TATUM

I'm not talking to you.

KENNY

Where'd she go?

GALE

Look, Kenny, I know you're about fifty

pounds overweight but when I say hurry

please interpret that as...MOVE YOUR

FAT TUB OF LARD ASS NOW!

SIDNEY

Did you reach my Dad?

DEWEY

You're sure it was the Hilton?

SIDNEY

At the airport.

DEWEY

He's not registered. Could he have gone

to another hotel?

SIDNEY

I don't know. I guess.

DEWEY

We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.

SHERIFF BURKE

What are you doing with a cellular

telephone, son?

MR. LOOMIS

It's my phone. He was just playing

around with it.

SHERIFF BURKE

You got some ideas of playing around, boy.

BILLY

I didn't call anyone with it. I just

took it for fun.

MR. LOOMIS

Everybody's got one now. Why don't you

check the phone bill for chrissakes.

Call my carrier--AirFone Comp. They'll

have records of every number dialed.

SHERIFF BURKE

Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were

you doing out at Sidney's tonight?

BILLY

I just wanted to see her, that's all.

SHERIFF BURKE

You rode your bike out there?

BILLY

Yes, sir.

SHERIFF BURKE

And last night? Sidney said you crawled

through her window last night too?

MR. LOOMIS

(surprised)

You were out last night?

BILLY

I watched TV for awhile but the I felt

like going for a bike ride.

SHERIFF BURKE

Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?

BILLY

No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone,

Sheriff.

SHERIFF BURKE

We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The

governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows

who else on their way down here.

BILLY

This is crazy. I didn't do it.

DEWEY

That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's

and WalMart. Neither of which keep

purchase records.

SHERIFF BURKE

What about the cellular phone bill?

DEWEY

They're pulling Loomis' account. But

it'll be morning before we see something.

You think he did it?

SHERIFF BURKE

Twenty years ago I woulda said not a

chance. But these kids today...damn if I

know.

TATUM

(o.s.)

Hey...Dewey. Can we go now?

DEWEY

Hold up a sec...

SHERIFF BURKE

She staying with you?

DEWEY

We haven't located her Dad yet.

TATUM

(o.s.)

Goddammit, Dewey!

DEWEY

What did Mama tell you? When I wear this

badge you treat me like a man of the law.

TATUM

I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're

ready to go.

SHERIFF BURKE

Use the back way. Avoid the circus.

DEWEY

I'll get the car. Wait here.

GALE

Hello Sidney.

GALE

Some night. Are you alright?

GALE

What happened?

TATUM

She's not answering any questions. Just

leave us alone, okay?

SIDNEY

It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her

job. Right, GALE?

GALE

Yes, that's right.

SIDNEY

How's the book?

GALE

It'll be out later this year.

SIDNEY

I'll look for it.

GALE

I'll send you a copy.

TATUM

God, I loved it. "I'll send you a copy."

BAM! Bitch went down. "I'll send you a

copy." BAM! Sid--SuperBitch!

DEWEY

I thought you might want some ice for

that right hook.

DEWEY

I'll be right next door. Try to get some

sleep.

SIDNEY

Any word on my Dad?

DEWEY

(turning to her)

Not yet, but we're looking. If you need

anything...

TATUM

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

SIDNEY

Just another sleepover at the Riley's.

TATUM

Just like old times, ain't it?

SIDNEY

No, nothing's like it used to be.

TATUM

Do you really think Billy did it?

SIDNEY

He was there, Tatum.

TATUM

I knew this guy was too perfect. He was

destined to have a flaw.

MAMA RILEY

Telephone, dear.

TATUM

Who is it?

MAMA RILEY

It's for Sid

SIDNEY

My Dad?

TATUM

Take a message.

SIDNEY

It's alright. I'll get it.

MAMA RILEY

(whispers)

How is she?

SIDNEY

Hello?

MAN

(from phone)

Hello Sidney.

SIDNEY

NOOOOOO...

MAN

(from phone)

Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy

doesn't stand a chance with you.

SIDNEY

LEAVEMEALONE!

MAN

Looks like you fingered the wrong

guy...again.

SIDNEY

Who are you?

TATUM

Hang up, Sid.

MAN

Don't worry. You'll find out soon

enough. I promise.

MAMA RILEY

Dewey! Dewey!

MAN

This is gonna be fun, Sidney. Just like

old times.

DEWEY

What? What?

MAMA RILEY

I think you girls really should stay home

today.

TATUM

Your objection is duly noted.

SIDNEY

I'd rather be around a lot of people,

Mama Riley.

REPORTER

(on TV)

..who escaped a vicious attack last night

was the daughter of Maureen Prescott who

was brutally killed last year when

convicted murderer Cotton Weary...

REPORTER

(cont'd)

..broke into their home and savagely

raped and tortured the deceased. Cotton

Weary is currently awaiting appeal for

the death sentence handed down after the

young Sidney testified against him. She

was the key witness in the state's

prosecution...

SIDNEY

It's never gonna stop. Is it?

DEWEY

Billy was released. His cellular bill

was clean. He didn't make those calls.

SIDNEY

Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not

making it up.

DEWEY

I know. We're checking every cellular

account in the county. Any calls made to

you or Casey Becker are being cross-

referenced. It's gonna take time but

we'll find him.

SIDNEY

And my Dad? Any word on him?

DEWEY

Hey, it's school. You'll be safe here.

REPORTER

How does it feel to almost be brutally

murdered?

DEWEY

Leave the girl alone, will ya? She wants

to go to school.

TATUM

Come on, Sid.

SIDNEY

Just a sec...I need to talk to someone.

GALE

Stop right there.

SIDNEY

I'm not here to fight.

GALE

Just stay back.

SIDNEY

I want to talk to you.

GALE

(calling into the van)

Kenny. Camera. Now.

SIDNEY

Off the record. No cameras.

GALE

Forget it.

SIDNEY

Please. You owe me.

GALE

I owe you shit.

SIDNEY

You owe my mother.

GALE

Your mother's murder was last year's

hottest court case. Somebody was gonna

write a book about it.

SIDNEY

And it had to be you with all your lies

and bullshit theories.

GALE

What is your problem? You got what you

wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail.

They're gonna gas him. A book is not

gonna change that.

SIDNEY

Do you still think he's innocent?

GALE

He was convicted in a court of law. Your

testimony put him away. It doesn't

matter what I think.

SIDNEY

During the trial, you did all those

stories about me. You called me a liar.

GALE

I think you falsely identified him. Yes.

SIDNEY

Have you talked to Cotton?

GALE

Many times.

SIDNEY

Has his story changed?

GALE

Not one word. He admits to having sex

with your mother but that's all.

SIDNEY

He's lying. She wouldn't have touched

him. He raped her, then butchered her.

Her blood was all over his coat.

GALE

He was drunk that night. He left his

coat at your house, after your mother

seduced him...

SIDNEY

I saw him leaving wearing it.

GALE

But couldn't it have been someone else

you saw wearing that coat? The same

person who planted it in Cotton's car,

framing him? The same person who

really killed your mother?

SIDNEY

No, Cotton murdered my mother.

GALE

You're not so sure anymore, are you?

SIDNEY

No, it was Cotton.

TATUM

(to GALE)

Nice welt.

GALE

The killer is still on the loose, isn't

he? These murders are related.

TATUM

Yo--let's rock.

SIDNEY

I'm sorry I mangled your face.

GALE

Wait, Sidney, don't go...

GALE

Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death

row. A killer still on the loose.

Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

KENNY

You want to go live?

GALE

No, not so fast. We have nothing

concrete.

KENNY

When did that ever stop you? You can't

sit on this. This is huge.

GALE

If I'm gonna blow this up-I need hard

proof.

KENNY

But it's so much easier when we make it

up.

GALE

Not this time. I owe Cotton that much.

Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.

TATUM

Just relax. You're at school now. No

one can get you here.

SIDNEY

But if it wasn't Billy it could be

anybody. He could be here at school

right now.

TATUM

Serial killers are smart by definition.

They minimize their risk. They plan and

pre-calculate everything. Showing up

here would be the most lame-brain

move he could make.

SIDNEY

He promised me he'd be back.

TATUM

I wouldn't put too much stock in a

psycho's promise.

REPORTER

This morning several students, in what

appears to be a prank, have been spotted

wearing masks. School officials have yet

to comment but this is the same type of

mask worn by the killer...

SIDNEY

This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.

TATUM

I want you to meet me here right after

class, okay?

TATUM

Shit, what is he doing here?

SIDNEY

I bet he's pissed.

TATUM

Just ignore him. You had good reason to

think what you did.

BILLY

Hi, Sid. Can we talk a sec?

TATUM

You know if I were accused of carving up

two people, I'd take the opportunity to

skip school.

STU

Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.

BILLY

Talk to me, Sid.

SIDNEY

Why are they doing this?

STU

Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.

STU

Owwww...

BILLY

You open your mouth and stupidity pours

out.

STU

Sorry.

TATUM

(yelling)

Stay away from her, Billy.

SIDNEY

Jesus, SHIT!

BILLY

Hey, hey, it's just me.

BILLY

What? You don't still think it's me?

SIDNEY

No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy,

someone was there, someone tried to

kill me.

BILLY

The police say I scared him off. It

wasn't me, Sid.

SIDNEY

I know. He called again last night at

Tatum's house.

BILLY

See, it couldn't have been me. I was in

jail, remember?

SIDNEY

I'm so sorry...please understand.

BILLY

Understand what? That I got a girlfriend

who would rather accuse me of being a

psychopathic killer than touch me.

SIDNEY

You know that's not true.

BILLY

Then what is it? Is there somebody else?

SIDNEY

No...

BILLY

Is it the sex thing? Am I being too

pushy?

SIDNEY

No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm

still adjusting to my mom.

BILLY

It's been a year since she died.

SIDNEY

(correcting him)

Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.

BILLY

When are you gonna let that go, Sid?

When my mom left my dad--I just accepted

it. This is the way it is. She's not coming

back.

SIDNEY

(sharply)

Your parents split up. It's not the same

thing. Your mom left town, she's not in

a coffin somewhere.

BILLY

You have to move on, Sid.

SIDNEY

I'm glad to know you're coping so well

with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so

perfect. Some of us are just trying to

hold on.

GIRL #1

She was never attacked. I think she made

it all up.

GIRL #2

Why would she lie about it?

GIRL #1

For attention. The girl has some serious

issues.

GIRL #1

What if she did it? What if Sidney

killed Casey and Steve?

GIRL #2

And why would she do that?

GIRL #1

Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed

them both in a jealous rage.

GIRL #2

Why would Sidney want to be with Steve?

She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.

GIRL #1

Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.

GIRL #2

You're evil.

GIRL #1

Please, it's common knowledge. Her

mother was a trollop.

GIRL #2

Cut some slack. She watched her mom get

butchered.

GIRL #1

And it fucked her up royally. Think

about it. It makes perfect sense. Her

mom's death leaves her distraught and

hostile at a cruel and inhumane world,

she's disillusioned, where's God, etc.

Completely suicidal. And one day she

snaps. She wants to kill herself but

realizes teen suicide is out this year.

And homicide is a much healthier

therapeutic expression.

GIRL #2

Where do you get this shit?

GIRL #1

Ricki Lake.

SIDNEY

Pathetic.

MAN

(o.c. whisper)

Siddneey...

SIDNEY

Is someone there?

MAN

(softly, simply)

It's me, Sidney.

MR. HIMBRY

Two students have been savagely murdered.

And this is how we express our compassion

and sensivity?

MR. HIMBRY

We throw on a mask and dance around

campus just hoping someone else gets

butchered before we get bored again.

You're both expelled.

GHOST #1

Aw, come on, Mr. Himbry, it was just a

joke.

GHOST #2

Yeah, that's not fair.

MR. HIMBRY

No, it's not fair. Fairness would be to

rip your insides out and hang you from

a tree so you can be exposed for the

desensitized, heartless little shits that

you are.

SIDNEY

(crying)

He's here...I saw him...he's here...

MR. HIMBRY

Easy child.

SHERIFF BURKE

(from radio)

She's okay. Looks like some boys were

teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the

school though. I want you to take look

around.

DEWEY

Yes, sir, sheriff.

GALE

Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent,

INSIDE STORY.

DEWEY

I know who you are, ma'am. How's the

eye?

GALE

Productive. So they're closing down the

school?

DEWEY

Well..uh...yes ma'am. For the time being.

GALE

And why is that? Has something happened?

DEWEY

You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.

GALE

I know, I should be in New York covering

the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew?

Please, call me Gale. You look awfully

young to be a police officer.

DEWEY

I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.

GALE

Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study

I proved to be most popular amongst

males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course,

you don't look a day over twelve, except

in the upper torso area. Does the force

require that you work out?

DEWEY

No, ma'am. Because of my boyish good

looks, muscle mass has increased my

acceptance as a serious police officer.

MR. HIMBRY

(via PA)

"Your attention please. Due to the

recent events that have occurred and

until it comes to a resolve--effective

immediately--all classes are suspended

til further notice. The Bayboro Police

Dept. has also asked me to announce a

city wide curfew beginning at 6 o'clock

PM. I repeat..."

GALE

Boy, you people sure do make fuss over

a serial killer.

DEWEY

Serial killer is not really accurate,

ma'am. The killer has yet to strike

twice.

GALE

Well, we can hope, can't we? We

certainly don't have any leads. A ghost

mask, a cellular phone--not much there.

DEWEY

We're tracking the cellular phone bill.

GALE

Really? You small town guys are good.

And have you located Sidney's father?

DEWEY

No, not yet.

GALE

He's not a suspect, is he?

DEWEY

We haven't ruled out that possibil...

DEWEY

If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

GALE

Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.

DEWEY

That's quite alright. If I may say so,

ma'am, you're much prettier in person.

GALE

So you do watch the show?

DEWEY

I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole

year.

GALE

You are precious. Please, call me Gale.

TATUM

It was just some sick fuck having a

laugh.

SIDNEY

It was him, Tatum. I know it.

TATUM

You are not to be alone again. Is that

clear? If you pee--I pee.

STU

Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid,

what happened?

TATUM

For once, Stu, drop it.

STU

Okay, but whatever you did--the entire

student body thanks you.

STU

And to celebrate this impromptu fall

break, I propose we have a party.

Tonight, my house.

SIDNEY

Are you serious?

STU

My parents are out of town. It'll be

like my hurricane bash last year.

Nothing extreme. Just a few of us,

hangin'.

TATUM

This could be good. What do you think,

Sid?

SIDNEY

I don't know...

TATUM

Come on. Pathos has it's perks.

STU

Remember, there's safety in numbers.

SIDNEY

(giving in)

Yeah, okay...whatever.

STU

Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.

MR. HIMBRY

Damn...

MR. HIMBRY

Yes? Hello?

MR. HIMBRY

Little shits.

TATUM

Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth.

Maybe he was having an affair with your

mom.

SIDNEY

So you think my mom was a slut too?

TATUM

I didn't say that, Sid. But you know

there were rumors. Your dad was

always out of town on business.

Maybe your mom was a very unhappy

woman.

SIDNEY

If they were having an affair how come

that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

TATUM

You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's

a rumor.

SIDNEY

Created by that little tabloid twit Gale

Weathers.

TATUM

(delicately)

It goes further back, Sid. There's been

talk about other men.

SIDNEY

And you believe it?

TATUM

Well...you can only hear that Richard

Gere-gerbil story so many times before

SIDNEY

If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still

out there.

TATUM

Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to

sound like some Wes Carpenter flick.

Don't freak yourself out--we've got a

long night ahead of us.

SIDNEY

You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore

me.

TATUM

Come on, let's rock.

BILLY

How'd you do?

STU

Piece of cake. She'll be there.

BILLY

Thanks, butt wart. You did good.

STU

So you gonna try and make up with Sid?

BILLY

Duh...that's quick.

STU

I was just asking. Why are you always at

me?

BILLY

Because I'm trying to build your self-

esteem. You're far too sensitive.

STU

Oh....

BILLY

You ready to party hard tonight?

STU

You know it.

STU

Jesus, this place is packed.

RANDY

(picking up videos)

We had a run in the mass murder section.

STU

You coming tonight?

RANDY

Yeah, I'm off early--curfew you know.

(looking off)

Now that's poor taste.

STU

What?

RANDY

If you were the only suspect in a

senseless bloodbath would you be standing

in the horror section?

STU

It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't

do anything.

RANDY

You're such a little lap dog. He's got

killer printed all over his forehead.

STU

The why'd the police let him go?

RANDY

Because, obviously they don't watch

enough movies. This is standard horror

movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.

STU

Why would he want to kill his own

girlfriend?

RANDY

There's always some stupid bullshit

reason to kill your girlfriend. That's

the beauty of it all. Simplicity.

Besides, if it's too complicated you lose

your target audience.

STU

So what's his reason?

RANDY

Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

STU

She's saving herself for you.

RANDY

Could be. Now that Billy's tried to

mutilate her, you think Sid would go out

with me?

STU

I think her father did it. How come they

can't find his ass?

RANDY

Because he's probably dead. His body

will come popping out in the last reel

somewhere...eyes gauged. See, the police

are always off track with this shit, if they'd

watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time.

There's formula to it. A very simple one.

Everyone's always a suspect--the father,

the principal, the town derelict...

STU

Which is you...

RANDY

So while they're off investigating a dead

end, Billy, who's been written off as a

suspect, is busy planning his next

hunting expedition.

BILLY

(o.c.)

How do we know you're not the killer?

RANDY

Uh...hi, Billy.

BILLY

Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it's

reality button?

RANDY

You're absolutely right. I'm the first

to admit it. If this were a scary movie,

I'd be the prime suspect.

STU

And what would be your motive?

RANDY

It's 1995--motives are incidental.

DEWEY

A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.

TATUM

Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a

little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe.

SIDNEY

God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN

THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.

DEWEY

Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout

some killer in Texas.

TATUM

Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a

movie about you. Who's gonna play you?

SIDNEY

Oh, god...

DEWEY

I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

SIDNEY

Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd

cast Tori Spelling.

DEWEY

I'll just be a few minutes. Don't go

far.

SIDNEY

Is Billy going to be there tonight?

TATUM

He better not be. I told Stu to keep his

mouth shut. I think we can live without

EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for

one night.

CHECK OUT LADY

You girls gonna have to hurry it up.

We're under curfew.

TATUM

Two minutes tops.

SHERIFF BURKE

Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?

DEWEY

Keeping my eye on Sidney.

SHERIFF BURKE

Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real

bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls

were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney's

father. He made the calls with his cellular

phone. It's confirmed.

DEWEY

Couldn't his cellular number have been

cloned?

SHERIFF BURKE

There's more. Guess what tomorrow is?

The anniversary of his wife's death. It all

fits. He's our man.

DEWEY

Have you contacted the bureau?

SHERIFF BURKE

They believe he's out of state by now.

We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in

effect through the night. If he's not

picked up by morning--we'll do a house

to house.

DEWEY

You think he could still be in town?

SHERIFF BURKE

He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?

DEWEY

She's with my sister. Should I bring her

in?

SHERIFF BURKE

Hold off for now. Just stay close to

her.

DEWEY

She'll be with her friends over at Stu

Maker's tonight.

SHERIFF BURKE

Watch her. Don't let on--just keep your

eyes out.

DEWEY

Yes, sir.

SIDNEY

Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I

just can't relax.

TATUM

You have a few intimacy issues as a

result of your mother's untimely death.

It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.

SIDNEY

But he's been so patient with me, Tatum.

You know, with all the sex stuff. How

many guys would put up with a girlfriend

who's sexually anorexic?

TATUM

Billy and his penis don't deserve you.

SIDNEY

What do you think about when you're

having sex?

TATUM

With Stu, there's little time to stop and

reflect. But sometimes before, to relax

and get in the mood, I think about Grant

Goodeve.

SIDNEY

Who?

TATUM

Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on

EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He

was the one who lived off alone. He would come

around every now and then with his guitar and

sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."

He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot

brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I

was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show

came on every day after school right during my

puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental

in my maturing as a woman.

SIDNEY

How does that get you in the mood with

Stu?

TATUM

During foreplay, I sing the theme song to

myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives

with love..." It's a real turn on.

SIDNEY

No way.

TATUM

Grant wrote the song himself. I'm

convinced the lyrics had a secret

meaning, "Eight is enough..."

SIDNEY

What secret meaning? Like a Satanical

thing?

TATUM

Watch the show, Sid. His basket is

bigger than the one you're pushing.

SIDNEY

TATUM!

TATUM

Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits

til he's dead but the minute you mention

an eight inch weenie. Watch out.

TATUM

There's that sense of humor. I knew it

still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some

fun tonight.

SIDNEY

Deal.

DEWEY

You girls ready.

SIDNEY

Yeah.

DEWEY

Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard

tonight, Sid.

TATUM

No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.

DEWEY

Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the

way, I promise.

TATUM

Shit.

TATUM

Caterer's here.

TATUM

That's mature.

STU

Where you guys been? We had to start

without you.

KENNY

What's the plan?

GALE

Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a

window and tape all of tonight's

festivities.

KENNY

The control board's glitched. You know

we can't carry a live picture.

GALE

What's the delay?

KENNY

About thirty seconds.

GALE

As long as it records I don't give a

shit. We're not doing a remote.

DEWEY

Evening, ma'am.

GALE

Deputy...good evening.

DEWEY

What brings you out to these parts?

GALE

You never know when or where a story will

break.

DEWEY

Not much story here. Just a bunch of

kids cutting loose.

GALE

Then what are you doing here?

DEWEY

Keeping an eye on things. Checking the

place out.

GALE

Mind if I join you?

DEWEY

Not at all.

RANDY

I thought we'd make it a BLOCKBUSTER

night.

STU

I thought everything was checked out.

RANDY

I had 'em hid in the foreign section.

SIDNEY

THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT

--How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these

movies?

RANDY

She's the Scream Queen.

STU

With that set of lungs--she should be.

TATUM

(to Sid)

Tits--see.

RANDY

How many EVIL DEAD'S?

(hands go up)

How many HELLRAISER'S?

STU

I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're

in the fridge in the garage.

TATUM

What am I? The beer wench?

STU

(o.c.)

Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick

from INSIDE STORY?

TATUM

Shit, Dewey!

TATUM

What is she doing here?

DEWEY

She's with me. I just wanted to check on

things.

TATUM

So you did--now leave...and take your

media muff with you.

SOME TEEN

I watch your show regularly.

STU

This must be big news to be on INSIDE

STORY.

GALE

Huge.

ANOTHER TEEN

Wanna interview us?

RANDY

We could be like two grief stricken

students and we'll say really nice things

about our good friends who were

slaughtered senselessly.

STU

I can cry on cue.

GALE

Maybe later?

GALE

Can I trouble you for some water?

STU

How 'bout a beer? Randy--get the lady a

beer.

RANDY

You get it.

SIDNEY

Have they found my father?

DEWEY

Afraid not.

SIDNEY

Should I be worried?

DEWEY

Not yet.

TATUM

SHIT!

TATUM

Hey, Shitheads!

TATUM

OH, SHIT PISS!

TATUM

What the...

TATUM

Is that you, Randy? Cute.

TATUM

And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON

YOUR GARAGE.

TATUM

Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she'll

flip.

TATUM

Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?

TATUM

Can I be the helpless victim?

TATUM

Okay, let's see. "No, please don't kill

me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the

sequel."

TATUM

Cut, Casper. That's a wrap.

TATUM

Randy--will you stop?

TATUM

You little shit.

TATUM

Who are you?

TATUM

NOOOOOOOO.....

SIDNEY

Billy? Jesus, you scared me.

STU

(with a wink)

Dude. What are you doing here?

BILLY

I was hoping Sid and I could talk.

SIDNEY

If Tatum sees you--she'll draw blood.

STU

You guys can go up to my parents room?

To talk and...whatever.

BILLY

Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.

SIDNEY

It's okay. We need to talk.

RANDY

What's Leatherface doing here?

STU

He came to make up.

RANDY

There goes my chance with Sid.

STU

Like you had one.

KENNY

Got a picture. Perfect placement. We

can see everything.

GALE

Tell me, Kenny, has a cheesy tabloid

journalist ever won the Pulitzer?

SIDNEY

So...

BILLY

So...I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit

and I'm sorry.

SIDNEY

No, Billy. I'm the one who's been

selfish and self-absorbed with all of my

post traumatic stress.

BILLY

You lost your mom...

SIDNEY

But you're right--enough is enough. I

can't wallow in the grief process forever

and I can't keep lying to myself about

who my mom was.

SIDNEY

I think in some weird analytical,

psychological bullshit way I'm scared

I'm gonna turn out just like her, you

know? Like the bad seed or something...

BILLY

Oh Sidney...

SIDNEY

Everytime I get close to you I see my

mom. I know it doesn't make sense.

BILLY

Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in

SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she

kept having flashbacks of her dead father.

SIDNEY

But this is life. This isn't a movie.

BILLY

Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's

one great big movie. Only you can't

pick your genre.

SIDNEY

I wanna let go. I do...

BILLY

Ssshh...everything's gonna be okay. I

promise.

SIDNEY

Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

BILLY

Sshh..it's okay.

SIDNEY

Or even a good porno.

BILLY

(shocked)

What?

SIDNEY

You heard me.

BILLY

(incredulous)

Are you serious?

SIDNEY

(surprising herself)

Yeah...I think so.

TEEN #1

Look, here it comes. SPLAT!

TEEN #2

The blood's not the right color. Why do

they do that? It's too red.

RANDY

Here comes another...

TEEN #3

Predictable. Knew he was going to bite

it.

BORED TEEN

How can you watch this shit over and

over?

RANDY

Shhhhh.

STU

I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do

we see Jamie Lee's breasts?

RANDY

Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie

Lee was always the virgin in horror movies.

She didn't show her tits until she went legit.

BOY TEEN

No way.

RANDY

That's why she always lived. Only

virgins can outsmart the killer in the

big chase scene in the end. Don't you

know the rules?

STU

What rules?

RANDY

There are certain rules that one must

abide by in order to successfully survive

a horror movie. For instance: 1. You

can never have sex. The minute you get a

little nookie--you're as good as gone.

Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink

or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an

extension of number one. And 3. Never,

ever, ever, under any circumstances, say

"I'll be right back."

STU

Wanna another beer?

RANDY

Yeah.

STU

I'll be right back.

RANDY

There he goes folks--a dead man. Wave

bye-bye.

DEWEY

Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check

out a possible lead. Thought you might

like to join me.

GALE

What kind of lead?

DEWEY

A car was spotted in the bushes a little

ways up the road.

GALE

I'd love to. If you're sure it's

alright?

DEWEY

Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.

GALE

Can I bring Kenny?

DEWEY

(too quickly)

NO! I mean...I should probably take just

you.

GALE

I'll be back.

DEWEY

Actually, I thought we could walk. It's

not far.

RANDY

(pointing to TV)

Look, here comes the obligatory tit shot.

OTHER GUYS

Beautiful! Finally!

SIDNEY

(to herself)

"Eight is enough to fill our lives with

love..."

RANDY

Hello? Yeah....HOLY SHIT.

RANDY

Listen up. They found Principal Himbry

dead. He was gutted and hung from the

goal post on the football field.

TEEN #1

So what are we waiting for?

TEEN #2

Let's get over there before they pry him

down.

RANDY

We were just getting to the good part.

SIDNEY

Who did you call?

BILLY

What?

SIDNEY

When you're arrested-you're allowed one

phone call? Who did you call?

BILLY

I called my dad.

SIDNEY

No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw

him.

BILLY

Yeah...and when I called no one answered.

SIDNEY

Uh-huh.

BILLY

You don't still think it was me?

SIDNEY

No, but if it were you, that would have

been a very clever way to throw me off

track. Using your one phone call to call

me so I wouldn't think it was you.

BILLY

What do I have to do to prove to you I'm

not a killer?

SIDNEY

BILLYWATCHOUT!!!!

GALE

So is Dewey your real name?

DEWEY

Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck

with a long time ago.

GALE

I like it. It's... sexy.

DEWEY

Nah... it's just this town's way of not

taking me serious.

GALE

What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a

meteorologist...

GALE

People treat me like the Antichrist of

television journalism.

DEWEY

I don't think you're so bad.

GALE

Are all the local boys as sweet as you?

DEWEY

You okay?

GALE

What's that?

DEWEY

Looks like a car.

DEWEY

Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.

GALE

Sidney's father?

DEWEY

We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here.

What the fuck is he doing here?

RANDY

(to TV)

No, Jamie. Look behind you! Watch out!

Behind you!

KENNY

JESUS...FUCK...

KENNY

(screaming at the monitor)

BEHIND YOU! LOOK BEHIND YOU!

DEWEY

I'll call for backup.

GALE

I'll get my camera.

GALE

Kenny! Camera! Quick!

GALE

Kenny?

GALE

(calling out)

Dewey?

GALE

Dewey? Where are you?

RANDY

What's going on?

SIDNEY

DEWEY!

SIDNEY

NOOOOOOOO!!!!!

SIDNEY

Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house

on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA

KILL ME!

VOICE

(o.c.)

Sidney!

RANDY

Jesus, Sid. We gotta get out of here.

SIDNEY

Stop. Right there.

RANDY

Don't shoot. It's me.

SIDNEY

Don't come any closer.

RANDY

Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's

dead, she's been killed...I think Stu did

it.

VOICE

(o.c.)

Don't believe him, Sid.

STU

He's lying. He killed Tatum. And Billy.

SIDNEY

Stay away.

STU

His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid.

He's gone psycho.

RANDY

Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the

one.

STU

Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.

RANDY

No, Sid.

SIDNEY

Fuck you both.

RANDY

NO, SID. OPEN UP. PLEASE...

HE'S GONE CRAZY.

SIDNEY

Please! God! Help me!

VOICE

(from the phone)

Having fun Sidney?

SIDNEY

NOOOOOOOOO!!!

SIDNEY

(at the door)

GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE!

SIDNEY

Oh God. Billy!

SIDNEY

I thought you were...

BILLY

I'm alright. Gotta...get...help.

SIDNEY

He's out there.

RANDY

(through door)

Please, you gotta let me in. He's

gonna kill me.

SIDNEY

NO! Don't believe him.

BILLY

It's okay. Give me the gun.

RANDY

Help me...

BILLY

(calming him)

Shhhh. It's okay.

RANDY

Stu's flipped out. He's gone mad.

BILLY

"We all go a little mad sometimes."

BILLY

Anthony Perkins--PSYCHO

BILLY

Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for

pig's blood in CARRIE.

SIDNEY

Stu...please...help me...

STU

(whispering into phone)

Surprise, Sidney.

BILLY

Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've

got one more surprise--Stu, I believe it's

your turn.

STU

Oh yeah

BILLY

(to Sidney)

What's wrong? You look like you've seen

a ghost.

SIDNEY

Daddy!

BILLY

Close enough.

STU

Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.

SIDNEY

Why are you doing this?

STU

It's all part of the game.

BILLY

It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!

SIDNEY

Fuck you.

BILLY

We already played that game. You lost,

remember?

STU

You have to play, Sid. Don't want to

disappoint your dad. He's been waiting

around all night.

BILLY

It's an easy game. We ask you a

question. If you get it wrong--you die.

STU

And if you get it right--you die.

SIDNEY

You're crazy--both of you.

STU

The official term is "psychotic".

SIDNEY

You'll never get away with this.

BILLY

Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't

believe how easy it was to frame him.

STU

Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took

a few notes. It was fun.

SIDNEY

Why did you kill my mother?

BILLY

Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I

think she wants a motive. Hmmm...I don't

really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did

Norman Bates have a motive?

STU

Nope.

BILLY

And did they really ever explain why

Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?

Don't think so. You see, it's scarier

when there's no motive, Sid.

SIDNEY

(fighting tears)

I don't understand...

BILLY

We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman

was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit

all over town like she was Sharon Stone or

something.

STU

(laughing)

..so we put her out of her misery. I

mean, let's face it, your mom was no

Sharon Stone.

BILLY

Is that motive enough for you? Or how

about this? Did you know your slut

mother was sleeping with my dad and she's

the reason my mom moved out and deserted

me.

SIDNEY

What?

BILLY

Think about it. On the off chance I get

caught-a motive like that could divide a

jury for years, don't you think?. You took

my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy

factor. Maternal abandonment causes

serious deviant behavior. It certainly

fucked you up. It made you have sex with

a psychopath.

STU

That's right and now that you're no

longer a virgin. You gotta die--those

are the rules.

BILLY

Pretend this is all just a scary movie,

Sid. How do you think it's going to end?

STU

(excited)

This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got

it all figured out. Why do you think we

kept your father alive so long? Why did

we save you for last?

BILLY

You know what time it is, Sid? It's

after midnight. It's your mother's

anniversary. We killed her exactly one

year ago today.

BILLY

Ready?

STU

Yeah...

STU

Jesus...

STU

Good one. My turn.

BILLY

Don't forget-stay to the side and don't

go too deep.

BILLY

Jesus...fuck, that hurt.

SIDNEY

Stop it!

BILLY

(squelching the pain)

Got the ending figured out yet? Time's

running out.

STU

Come on, Sid. Think about it. Your

father is the chief suspect. We cloned

his cellular. The evidence is there.

BILLY

What if your father snapped? Your mom's

anniversary set him off and he went on a

murder spree, killing everyone...

STU

(in major pain)

Except for me and Billy...we were left

for dead...

BILLY

And then he killed you and then shoots

himself in the head. It's a perfect

ending.

STU

Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on

and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these

days--you gotta have a sequel.

SIDNEY

You sick fucks--you've seen one too many

movies.

BILLY

Oh Sid, don't blame the movies...Movies

don't create psychos. Movies just make

psychos more creative.

STU

That's it, Billy. I can't take any more.

I'm feeling woozy.

BILLY

Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.

STU

Where'd you put it?

BILLY

It's on the table.

STU

No, it's not.

BILLY

Where the fuck is it?

VOICE

(off camera)

Right here, asshole.

BILLY

I thought she was dead.

STU

She looked dead. Still does.

GALE

I've got an ending for you. The reporter

left for dead in the newsvan comes to,

stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the

gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day.

SIDNEY

I like that ending.

BILLY

She can't get both of us.

STU

Odds are--she'll miss anyway.

STU

Cool move.

BILLY

Where'd she go?

STU

I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.

BILLY

Where the fuck did she go?

BILLY

(picking up phone)

Hello?

SIDNEY

(from phone)

Are you alone in the house?

BILLY

You bitch--where the fuck are you?

SIDNEY

Not so fast.  We're gonna play a little

game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST

CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED

YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?

BILLY

Find her.

BILLY

FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!

STU

I can't...I'm bad off, Billy. You cut

to deep.

SIDNEY

(aware)

So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got

one. The police are on their way. What

are you going to tell them?

STU

Peer pressure...I'm way to sensitive.

BILLY

(SCREAMING in phone)

I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like

your slut whore mother.

SIDNEY

Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed

Mama's boy.

RANDY

You know what I hate most about horror

movies? The final scene...it just goes on

and on...and it gets so stupid...

RANDY

Sid, you found me out...I'm a virgin.

And pretty happy about it right now.

RANDY

Careful. This is the moment when you

think the killer's dead, but then he

springs back to life for one last scare.

SIDNEY

Not this time.

SIDNEY

This is for my Mom, asshole.

SIDNEY

And this Billy stud-bucket is for having

an incredibly small weenie.

SIDNEY

Oh Daddy...

GALE

I wanna close-up.

RANDY

This is probably an inappropriate

moment, but you think you'd want

to maybe go out with me sometime...

like on a date?

RANDY

Maybe catch a movie?

SIDNEY

Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.

RANDY

You got it.

THE END
