JANE

It'll take a month to probate the

will, Nell!  A month!  Even if

Mother left you something, you

won't get it in time to pay the

rent.  So instead of complaining,

you should be thanking Lou for

getting you these two weeks to get

Mother's things packed.

ELEANOR VANCE

You're still going to have to

RICHIE

NELL

I'm not going to stay.  I'll get a

job.  I'll get my own apartment.

JANE

Nell.  A job?  Two months and

where is this job?  You have no

degree, you've never worked --

NELL

-- I've never worked? --

JANE

You have no experience in the

world... the regular world.  What

would you put on a resume?

(beat, softening)

Now we all appreciate what you did

for Mother.  Isn't that right,

Lou?

LOU

Eleven years.  Long time.

JANE

That's why we've been talking.

With me getting more time in

Accessories, and Lou at the shop

all day, we need somebody to take

care of Richie, do a little

cleaning and cooking.  And in

return you can have the extra

room.

RICHIE

Eleanor, help me!  I've got to

pee!

LOU

Richie, knock it off before I beat

the crap out of you!

JANE

You're sure this is all of

Mother's jewelry?  The lawyer said

to make sure we took it to him...

(beat)

He said there might be some

antique pieces.  Have you seen

anything?  Some of it might be

valuable.

JANE (cont'd)

Think about our offer, Nell.  You

don't know how hard it is out

there.

NELL

Hello?  Yes, this is Eleanor.

-- Where?  Yes, it's right here.

TROUBLE SLEEPING?

END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

MALCOLM KEOGH

, in his 50's, is a graying professor, the

PROFESSOR JAMES MARROW

.  He is a man whose confidence

MALCOLM

It's still an electric shock!

MARROW

Come on Malcolm, it's only seven

ohms, it's nothing, it's like a

joy buzzer!  And it's not about

the pain, it's about the

interference with concentration...

MARROW (cont'd)

Look, look at what it does!  The

subjects on the left, because they

anticipate the shocks, make the

adjustment, and lose nothing on

their scores.  The subjects on the

right, because the shocks are

random, can't anticipate, and the

distraction throws them off.

MALCOLM

Stop defending your science after

the fact, Jim.  The department

protocol for research is very

clear about this, and you violated

the rules.  I know, I know, I know

that "Fear and Performance" is a

big sexy idea, but as long as I'm

chairman here you will need this

department's endorsement to

publish it, and right now I can't

do that.

MARY LAMBRETTA

, late 20's, Marrow's pretty T.A.,

MARROW

Malcolm, this is essential work

I'm doing.  Just think what my

research can do for education.

Elementary school classrooms near

train tracks or airports, where

loud noise is random; this helps

to prove the need for sound

insulation if the children are

ever going to learn to read.

MALCOLM

And that will be a good place to

end this study.

MARROW

No, Malcolm!  Individual

performance is only part of it.  I

know why baseball players choke

for no reason, I know why

violinists throw up with fear

before every concert, and need to,

to give a great performance, but

what I want to know is, how fear

works in a group...

MALCOLM

Not the way you've constructed

your group, it's just not ethical!

MARROW

But if the group knows it's being

studied as a group, you

contaminate the results.  The

deception is minor.

MALCOLM

Are you working with her?

MARROW

Mary, I'll meet you outside.

MALCOLM

Why are you working with her?

Mary Lambretta was thrown out of

the department for trying to get a

Ph.D. in psychic studies.

MARROW

And after she was thrown out, she

needed a job.

MALCOLM

You don't believe in the

paranormal.

MARROW

No, but she does, and that's all

that matters.

MALCOLM

Does she know that's why you're

using her?

MARROW

No.

MALCOLM

I, I just can't...

MARROW

She needed a job, Malcolm.  And

she's smart.  And she helps me.

MALCOLM

I have a bad feeling about what

you're doing.

MARROW

This is the last chapter.  Please,

please give me clearance.  It's

for science.

MALCOLM

I'm gonna hate myself for this.

MARROW

Thank you.

MARY

I see a hostile man... he's (she

describes him).  The hostile man

does not believe in Madame Velka.

MARY

You know what he's really upset

about?

MARROW

What?

MARY

You're going to publish, he's

going to perish... And why did you

hire me for this?

MARY

It's for you.

MARROW

You hear the vibrations in the

wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in

the wires, you feel it.  I could

test it.

MARY

Test it.

MARROW

Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.

MARY

How'd I know it was for you?

MARROW

(quickly)

Because it's my phone.

(back to the phone)

Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the

boxes inside, thank you.  See you

soon.  Thank you.

MARY

Here's how they're organized.

Groups of five, very different

personalities: scored all over the

Kiersey Temperament Sorter just

like you asked for.  And they all

score high on the insomnia charts.

MARROW

Good.

MARROW (cont'd)

This is correct?

MARY

Her mother died two months ago.

She says she really wants to do

this.  I didn't know if it'd be

taking advantage...

MARROW

(meaning the graph,

not the face)

What a beautiful profile.  How do

you feel about her?  What does

your

intuition

say?

MARY

I put my favorites on the top.

MARROW (OC)

Okay... this one's good...

Extrovert Feeler... Okay... This

one I like, too...

MARY

What's this?

(has to get his

attention)

What's this... this picture?

MARROW

That?  That's Hill House.

MARY

This is where we're going?

MARROW

Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?

NELL

Hello Baby...

MOTHER (O.S.)

What's going on, what happened?

NELL

She's okay.  She woke up and she

saw she was alone.

MOTHER

Say thank you, Spencer.

(too much of an

explanation)

I was getting her something to

drink.  She's been crying all

day...

NELL

That's all right.

MOTHER

Of course you know, how many

children do you have?

NELL

None.

MOM

Then you're a teacher.  Nursery

school.

NELL

No.

MOM

You just... you seem like someone

who takes care of children, lots

of children.

NELL

Maybe... maybe someday.  I'd like

that.

NELL (cont'd)

Umm, I'm a little lost.

GAS STATION ATTENDANT

Where you going?

NELL

They sent me directions and I've

got a map, but it's kind of

confusing.  Here... it's a place

called Hill House?

GAS STATION ATTENDANT

Hill House.

NELL

What are you doing?

GAS STATION ATTENDANT

You don't want to go there.

NELL

Did I say something wrong to you?

MR. DUDLEY

, his hair

MR. DUDLEY

What do you want?

NELL

Oh!  You scared me.

MR. DUDLEY

Me?  No.  What are you doing here?

NELL

Are you Mister Dudley, the

caretaker?

MR. DUDLEY

Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the

caretaker.  What are you doing

here?

NELL

I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm

supposed to check in with Mrs.

Dudley up at the house.  Is she

here?

MR. DUDLEY

Maybe she is...

NELL

Why do you need a chain like that?

MR. DUDLEY

That's a good question.  What is

it about fences?  Sometimes a

locked chain makes people on both

sides of the fence just a little

more comfortable.  Why would that

be?

NELL

Is there something about the

house?

MR. DUDLEY

Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.

NELL

Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?  Mrs.

Dudley, are you here?  Anybody?

NELL

Wow...

NELL

Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?

NELL

Mrs. Dudley?

MRS. DUDLEY

, sallow, unsmiling.

MRS. DUDLEY

It's make the soup or answer the

door.  Can't do both.

NELL

Mrs. Dudley.

MRS. DUDLEY

So far.

NELL

I'm Eleanor Vance, I'm with --

MRS.  DUDLEY

-- Dr. Marrow's group.  You're the

first.

MRS. DUDLEY (cont'd)

I'll show you your room.

NELL

Hugh Crain.

MRS. DUDLEY

The Purple Room.  You're going to

be the first visitors that Hill

House has had since Mister Crain

died.

NELL

They're so beautiful.  Aren't

they?

MRS. DUDLEY

I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.

NELL

Well, I've never lived with

beauty.  You must love working

here.

MRS. DUDLEY

It's a job.  I keep banker's

hours.  I set dinner on the dining

room sideboard at six.  You can

serve yourselves.  Breakfast is

ready at nine.  I don't wait on

people.  I don't stay after

dinner.  Not after it begins to

get dark.  I leave before dark

comes.  We live in town.  Nine

miles.  So there won't be anyone

around if you need help.  We

couldn't even hear you, in the

night.

NELL

Why would we --

MRS. DUDLEY

-- no one could.  No one lives any

nearer than town.  No one will

come any nearer than that.  In the

night.  In the dark.

The

sun is setting

.

NELL

Finally.

NELL

Hello?

THEO

, 20s, exotic, sophisticated, in Vera Wang leather, wrestle with

THEO

You may think I have a sickness

about packing, but asking people

to help me shlep the stuff I take

with me everywhere is a cheap and

exploitative way of making new

friends.  My name's Theo.

NELL

I'm Eleanor but everyone calls me

Nell.  Eleanor Vance.  Nell.  I'm

really glad you're here.  Really.

NELL (cont'd)

What a beautiful jacket.

THEO

And what you're wearing, that's

great, too.

NELL

This?  It's from a thrift shop.

THEO

What did it cost?

NELL

Fifteen dollars.

THEO

That'd be seventy in New York.

You stole it!

NELL

(embarrassed by the

simple truth)

It's all I could afford.

THEO

Wait.  You're not wearing that

ironically?  This is really you?

NELL

I don't know what you mean.

THEO

A week.  You and I?  We're going

to have fun.

THEO

This is so twisted.

MRS. DUDLEY

I set dinner on the dining room

sideboard at six.

MRS. DUDLEY

Breakfast is at nine.  I don't

stay after dinner.  Not after it

begins to get dark.

MRS. DUDLEY (cont'd)

I leave, before dark.  So there

won't be anyone around if you need

help.

NELL

We couldn't even hear you.

MRS. DUDLEY

No one could.  No one lives any

nearer than town.

NELL

No one will come any nearer than

that.

MRS. DUDLEY

In the night.  In the dark.

NELL (cont'd)

My room is right next door.  I

think we share a bathroom.

THEO

Don't worry, I probably won't be

in here much.  Light sleeper.

NELL

That's why we're here.

THEO

What do you do?

NELL

I'm between jobs right now.  My

last job... it... the person I was

working for... the job ended.

Over.  So... And you?

THEO

That depends.

THEO (cont'd)

I'm supposed to be an artist, but

I've been really distracted from

work by love.  Do you know what I

mean?

NELL

Not really.

THEO

Don't tell me Boston is different

from New York.

NELL

(she knows this

from magazines)

Ohh, sure, you have trouble with

commitment.

THEO

My boyfriend thinks so, my

girlfriend doesn't.  If we could

all live together... but... they

hate each other.  It's hard to be

Miss Perversity when you're the

only one at the party.  D'you know

what I mean?

NELL

No.

THEO

(delighted)

A blank canvas!  I could paint

your portrait, directly on you.

Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands?

Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where

do you live?

NELL

I don't have anyone.

(beat, lying)

But I do have a little apartment

of my own.  It has a little flower

garden.  You can just see the

ocean.  At night, when the wind

comes in just right, you can hear

the buoys in the harbor.

THEO

That sounds really nice.  You're

lucky.  But you know that.

THEO (cont'd)

(with meaning)

Come on, we've seen enough of the

bedroom for now.

NELL

So much carving.  It's everywhere.

On everything.

THEO

Maybe you shouldn't touch --

THEO

Jeez.

NELL

I know.

NELL (cont'd)

Maybe we should wait for them

here.

THEO

Which one?  Pick any.

THEO

This is a serious question, but do

you think the Dudleys ever make

love in this room?  They're alone

in the house, no one watching.  No

one... no one watching.  You can

do what you want.

THEO

Here.  Here.  Here.

(under a leering

gargoyle)

Oh yes!  Oh yes oh YES!  Here!

THEO (cont'd)

Can't you just see it?

NELL

Theo!

NELL

I love this house.  I really love

this house.

THEO

(gently, recognizes

that Nell is

different)

You're okay.

THEO

(having fun)

Rats!  We're rats in a maze!

That's what this experiment is

going to be!

NELL

We should go back.

NELL

Theo, I'm scared --

LUKE

Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper,

I'm your basic tosser-turner, and

you are...

NELL

Uh... Nell Vance...

LUKE

And what kind of sleeper?

NELL

Well, I... uh...

LUKE

Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.

(to Theo)

And you?  I'd guess...

THEO

You'll never guess.

MARROW

There we are.  You're Eleanor,

you're Luke, you're Theo.

ALL

Hi... hello... Dr. Marrow...

MARROW

And this is Todd, he just came up.

TODD

comes in.

TODD

Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.

LUKE

(1950's alien

spaceman)

Greetings fellow insomniac.

TODD

(playing)

Greetings fellow sheep counter.

MARROW

And this is my assistant, Mary

Lambretta.

LUKE

Greetings.

MARROW

Eleanor, how was the drive?

NELL

You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.

MARROW

Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.

NELL

I'm really... honored to be part

of this study, Jim.

MARROW

Well... we're glad to have you.

Theo notices

.

MARROW

Have either of you seen David

Watts?

THEO

No, but Nell's been here longer

than I have.

NELL

I only saw Theo drive up.

LUKE

Who's Watts?

MARROW

The man who completes the group.

MARROW (cont'd)

Well, why don't we get some dinner

while we're waiting for him?

(beat, backing

through the doors

to the Great Hall)

Welcome to Hill House, everyone.

TODD

These old Victorian houses are

great, aren't they?

LUKE

(points to details;

ADJUST FOR SET)

It's not Victorian, everyone

thinks that the whole nineteenth

century was Victorian.  This is

gothic, this is English Craftsman,

this is Romanesque.  This is...

insane.  Who lives here?

MARROW

Nobody.  A local mill owner, Hugh

Crain, built it in 1830.  He had

no heirs, but he put the house in

trust, and the farmland around it,

with the stipulation that it never

be altered or sold.  Crain's

executors made good investments

and for the last hundred and

twenty years, Hill House has taken

care of itself.

TODD

So what's this study all about

anyway?  Mary described the kind

of tests we'll be doing, but

didn't fill us in on the big

picture.  She said you needed bad

sleepers, but this wasn't about

curing the problem.

MARY

I can tell you what this is about.

MARROW

Eat first, questions later, Mary,

please.

NELL

Is something wrong?

MARY

No.  Just... when I saw your

picture I had a feeling about you,

and now that I meet you, I know I

was right.

NELL

What?

MARY

Eat first, questions later.

LUKE

You know what I love about wine

that comes in bottles like this?

TODD

What?

LUKE

Every

year is a good year.

MARROW

Theo?  It's your turn.

THEO

The rest of you may hate your

insomnia, but I find it the best

time of the day for me.  I'm

alone.  Nobody's talking to me but

myself.  My mind is racing with

ideas, and I can think.

LUKE

Nah, you're going crazy with

doubt, all of your mistakes are

coming back up the pipes, and it's

worse than a nightmare. --

THEO (cont'd)

Excuse me.

LUKE

Don't give me that look, it's

everybody's problem, we just have

different variations, I for

example.  I fall asleep easily.

But I wake up around two or three

in the morning, every morning.

It's that time of night that

Fitzgerald called the deep dark

night of the soul.  I stare

into... the abyss.  Every night.

(breaks his own

somber mood)

It's the price I pay for being

such a jolly fellow.

(to Mary)

Y usted?

MARY

I think I'd fall asleep easily,

but just as I start to feel

comfortable, I see things in the

dark.

MARY

I feel the presence of something

watching me.  It's not... scary...

not by itself but... I don't want

to go to sleep because I'm worried

about the thing attacking me.  So

when I finally do fall asleep, I'm

like a soldier who's fallen asleep

at her post.  I feel like I've

betrayed myself.  Nell?

NELL

All of you have such interesting

problems.

NELL (cont'd)

No... Please, I know how that

sounds but... You're all so

articulate.  You know how to talk.

I feel like I'm here under false

pretenses.  It's silly, it's not

like... well, all of you have

trouble sleeping because you live

in the world, and the world is

complicated and scary, but

nothing's ever happened to me.  So

I don't have a reason to sleep

badly.

MARROW

You wrote that you had trouble

sleeping.

NELL

Yes, because someone was always

keeping me awake.  Ever since I

was little.  That was my job.  I

took care of my mother and I had

to be there for her all night

long, and she woke up all the

time.  And after she died, well,

it's been a few months, but I

still, I still wake up, it's... a

habit.

(beat)

I know we've only known each other

a couple of hours, but I'm really

glad to be with people who let me

talk about this.  I'm really happy

to be here with you.

MARROW

We're glad you're here.

MARROW (cont'd)

Why don't we move to another room?

MARY

It's an Erard.  Late 1870s.

NELL

What's wrong?

MARY

The harp is out of tune.

MARROW

I'll have to count David Watts as

a no-show.  So let's start.  Thank

you, Mary.

MARROW (cont'd)

All right?  So, to answer your

earlier question, Todd, why are we

here?  What do we all need in

life, what are the basics?  We

need food, we need water, we need

sleep.  Sleep.  All of you resist

it?  Why?  What does that mean?

Why do we resist sleep?  My field

of study is the individual's

psychology of emotion and

performance.

LUKE

So why did you need the Addam's

Family mansion for a scientific

test?

MARROW

I thought it best to be isolated,

to be in a location with a

definite sense of history, and I

wanted to make sure that it wasn't

so pleasant you'd all sleep too

easily.  You'll be taking a

variety of tests, none of them

harmful, and you've got the house,

the grounds, and each other to

keep you company.

THEO

When do we take the tests?

MARROW

Every day.  Basically we'll be

hanging out together like we have

so far this evening.

MARROW

Also, there is no phone service to

the House and no TV.  I have the

cell phone for emergencies.  We'll

begin the tests after breakfast

tomorrow.

MARY

Dr. Marrow, what is this house?

MARROW (cont'd)

There was once a king who built a

palace.  The King's name was Hugh

Crain.  A hundred and thirty years

ago, when the Merrimack Valley was

the center of American industry,

Hugh Crain made two hundred

million dollars.  That's forty-

three billion dollars in today's

money.  He could have anything he

wanted.  And what he wanted, was

Rene, his banker's beautiful

daughter.  Rene, and a house

filled with children.

NELL

All the carvings.

MARROW

But there's a sad catch to the

story.

MARY

What happened?

MARROW

There were no children.  Rene

died, and

then

Hugh Crain built

all of this, and then he died.

His heart was broken.

NELL

That's so sad.

MARY

I think there's more to the story.

This house has its own music,

Doctor Marrow, I can play it for

you, I can hear it.

MARY

My eye... oh... my eye... my

eye... oh... No...

TODD

Oh Jesus.

MARROW

Mary, let me see your eye.

NELL

Here, cover it.  Don't let her

touch it.

LUKE

Keep your head back, that's it.

MARROW

Here's my key to the gate.  Call

me the second you know anything.

LUKE

That could have been worse.

MARROW

Yeah.

MARROW

Luke, can I talk to you?

LUKE

Sure.

MARROW

Because... well, I know I can

trust you.

LUKE

Why?

MARROW

I've read your tests.

MARROW (cont'd)

There's something... I... I didn't

tell you everyth1ng about the

house, and about Hugh Crain... but

I'm asking you not to repeat it.

LUKE

I can keep a secret.

LUKE

He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh

Crain was a monster.  He said that

he was a brutal, horrible man.  He

told me that Crain drove his

workers to early deaths.  Crain

had children chained to the looms

in his mill.  And listen to this:

his beautiful Rene killed herself.

THEO

And why didn't Marrow tell

us

?

Doesn't he trust women?  That

fuck.

NELL

(she's thinking

about the story,

not Marrow)

A monster?  But he built this for

the woman he loved, like the Taj

Mahal.

THEO

The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it

was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell

us?

LUKE

He's trying to protect the

experiment.  Personally, I don't

think he's got a large enough

sample for valid results, but as

long as the money's good, and the

food is good, I'm in.

THEO

Nell, it was an accident.

MARROW

Icebreaker exercise conducted over

dinner.  Observed initial bonding

among subjects and experimenter.

After dinner first bland history

of House relayed.  Nell appears

most susceptible to suggestive

history.  Luke, who tested at the

bottom of the Levy-Mogel

Confidence Reliability Scale was

given the second part of the

story.  We should see some results

tomorrow.  Accident with harp,

while unfortunate... complements

the experimental fiction.

MARROW (cont'd)

Publish or perish.

THEO

Ever try putting your hair up in a

French twist?

NELL

Sorry.  I'm not used to being

touched.

THEO

You've been out of the world for a

long time, haven't you?

NELL

Yes.  I've missed it.

THEO

No.  The world has missed you.

NELL

Good night, Theo.

THEO

You, too.  Happy tossing and

turning.

NELL

Coming, Mother!

THEO (OC)

Nell!

THEO

What is it!?

THEO (cont'd)

Nell!

moving out here in the theater

.

THEO (cont'd)

Nell!

NELL

No!

THEO (cont'd)

Cold.  Oh, God.  Feel it.

NELL (cont'd)

It's in my room.

LUKE (OC)

Hey!  I heard screaming...

THEO

Luke.

NELL

You really didn't hear anything?

LUKE

Oh, look!  There he goes, ol' Hugh

Crain!

LUKE

Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm

going to bed.  They can stay up

talking another 45 minutes if they

want, but I gotta try to get some

sleep.

MARROW

Go ahead.

THEO

If this was some sort of joke, I'm

going to kill him.

NELL

You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.

MARROW

The cold sensation.  Who felt it

first?

NELL

Theo I think.  You've asked us

that three times, Doctor Marrow.

What's going on?

MARROW

How do you feel about Luke's

suggestion that it was just the

old plumbing?  Water hammer,

something like that?

THEO

I did just take a bath.  I don't

know.

THEO

I did just take a bath.

NELL

Mother always banged on the wall

when she needed me.  The night she

died... I heard her, but I

pretended I didn't.  I was just so

sick of it all.  And then the

banging stopped.  And in the

morning... she was dead.  This is

the first I've ever said this to

anyone.  That was the job I had,

Theo, it's the only job I've ever

known, and I failed.  I'm actually

a bad person, Theo.  The world

doesn't need me.

THEO

Oh, Nell.  Eleven years.  With all

due respect to your mother who I'm

sure was a saint, I'd have called

Doctor Kevorkian, if not for her,

for me.

NELL

Good night, Theo.

GIRL VOICE

Find us, find us Eleanor.

NELL

Sorry.

MARROW

For an American you do a good

imitation of the British at their

most apologetic.

(Veddy British)

Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry,

sorry...

NELL

Am I that bad?

THEO

Well this is a cozy breakfast.

MARROW

Good morning, Theo.  Luke.

LUKE

After I went to bed, the second

time, after the... noise... I had

the best night's sleep of my life.

Anybody?

NELL

Yes.  I feel realy rested, too.

Theo?

THEO

I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks

good.

THEO (cont'd)

Your makeup too.

MARROW

Eat your breakfast, Theo, then

we'll get started on the tests.

LUKE (cont'd)

I've been thinking about these

carvings.  Kids.  Lots of kids.

Fat little angel kids.  Wild kids.

Kids with furry animals.

NELL

The children.  The children Hugh

Crain built the house for.  The

children he never had.

LUKE

Come on.  These are the typically

sentimental gestures of a depraved

industrialist.

LUKE (cont'd)

Theo was working in the dining

room.  She's probably done by now.

You finish?

NELL

Couldn't get the last ones.  You?

LUKE

I did okay.

LUKE (cont'd)

We could do this stuff anywhere.

I don't know what he's up to yet.

But like I said, that's the fun.

It has something to do with this

environment.

NELL

There's someone in there!  There's

someone in there in the fireplace!

NELL

Jim...

NELL (cont'd)

Somebody was in here.  I saw him.

NELL (cont'd)

Are these yours?  I found them

right over there.

LUKE

Who drives a Toyota?

THEO

Maybe they're Mary's.

MARROW

Mary came with me.

NELL

When I first got here I saw a gray

car pull up.  I thought it was one

of us.

NELL

This is my car.

MARROW

And those are Luke's and mine.

LUKE

There's a carriage house around

back.

LUKE

Well, this lot is full!

THEO

He must have left.  Didn't like

the looks of the place or

something.

NELL

How could he have left without his

keys?

THEO

Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe

they're not even his.

LUKE

Then he's got to be in the

house...

MARROW

Watts!

LUKE

Watts!  Oh Watts!  Here Wattsy...

MARROW

Watts!  Can you hear us?

THEO

Watts?

NELL

What's his first name?

THEO

David.

NELL

David?  David Watts?  Can you hear

us?  David!  Daviiiiid!

MARROW

Do you know who these keys belong

to?

MRS. DUDLEY

No.

MARROW

I was expecting another guest

yesterday.  A man, David Watts.

Did you see him?

MRS. DUDLEY

No.

MARROW

Is your husband around?  I'd like

to --

MRS.  DUDLEY

-- Haven't seen him.

MARROW

Thank you.

NELL

David?

THEO

Maybe he never came in.  If he'd

come in, he would have left his

bags at the door, right?  Or maybe

he got here early, and went for a

walk, and fell.  Maybe he's

outside.

THEO (cont'd)

Oh my God, what is it?  Oh, the

smell... ohhh.

THEO

(looks to Nell for

an answer)

Is it over?

NELL

No, it's getting worse.

MARROW

Nell!  What's wrong?

NELL

That smell... oh, God.

MARROW

What did it smell like?

NELL

It was very specific.

MARROW

(so tell me...)

All right...

NELL

In the bathroom in my mother's

room, the toilet was next to an

old wooden table.  It smelled like

that wood.

MARROW

So... smell... is... Smell is the

sense that triggers the most

powerful memories.  And a memory

can trigger a smell.

NELL

I wasn't thinking about my

mother's bathroom.

MARROW

What happened after you smelled

it?

NELL

I looked at Theo.  She had a look

on her face.

MARROW

Like she smelled it too?

NELL

Yes.

MARROW

And then what happened?

NELL

I got more scared.

MARROW

Hmm.

NELL

I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the

study.

MARROW

No you're not.  Something moved

you.  You saw something.

NELL

I don't know.  Maybe I...

NELL (cont'd)

I haven't been with people in a

long time.

MARROW

I really haven't either.

MARROW (cont'd)

I mean, I'm surrounded by people,

day in, dayout.  Students,

colleagues.

(beat)

But most of the time, even when

I'm with them... you know... It's

all about power, there's not much

room for actually getting to know

someone or having someone getting

to know you.

LUKE (cont'd)

You have to see something.

NELL

My name.

NELL (cont'd)

No...

NELL

Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome

Home?  I've never been here.  Who

did this?

LUKE

It's somebody's idea of a joke.

NELL

Who did this?  Why are you doing

this?  I don't know any of you.

You don't know me.  Why are you

doing this to me?

LUKE

I didn't do it.

THEO

You could have.

LUKE

So could you!  Is this some fucked

up idea of art, putting someone

else's name to a painting?

THEO

No.

NELL

Theo... Did you?

THEO

Maybe you did it yourself.

NELL

Why?

THEO

I don't know.  You've been alone

for a long time, maybe you want

attention.

(pointing to

Marrow)

Maybe he did it...

MARROW

I didn't.  You know that, Nell.

NELL

I don't know anything.  Whoever

did this, please, just... just say

so... just... please... this is

cruel.  Don't be cruel to me.  I

can't stand it.  You don't know

me.

NELL

Are you coming to confess?

MARROW

I wish I were.  I wish I had done

it, then I could confess and you'd

be at peace.  That great moral

philosopher Frank Sinatra once

said to someone he loved, I wish

you had an enemy, so I could beat

him up.

NELL

Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did

it?

MARROW

I don't know.

NELL

It was a stupid thing to do.

MARROW

It was.

NELL

(for the absurdity

of the idea)

Welcome Home.

MARROW

You'll never see it again.  Mr.

Dudley's taking care of it.

(beat)

I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you

something you'd like to see?

NELL

(still too shaky

for enthusiasm)

Sure.

NELL

Oh... it's so beautiful...

NELL (cont'd)

Violets.  Somebody must've died

here.

MR. DUDLEY

That's where she hanged herself.

NELL

Who?

MR. DUDLEY

Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope.

Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie.

Don't know how she got it.

MARROW

That's enough, Mister Dudley.

MR. DUDLEY

She stepped off the platform.

(he looks up, with

a suggestive leer)

They had long skirts in those

days.

MARROW

Thank you, Mister Dudley,

please...

MR. DUDLEY

House is full of stories.  If you

know how to read these things,

it's an open book.  Just a

different library than the kind

you're used to.

NELL

Why?

MR. DUDLEY

Why'd she kill herself?

NELL

Yes.

MR. DUDLEY

(what other reason

is there?)

She was unhappy.

NELL

Why?

MR. DUDLEY

Can't say.  Haven't been here that

long.

(he's off)

Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to

work.

MARROW

That's a horrible story.

MARROW (cont'd)

You're smiling.

NELL

I was just thinking how happy I am

right now.  All my life, I've been

waiting for an adventure.  And I

thought, oh, I'll never have that,

adventures are for people who

travel long distances, that's for

soldiers, that's for the women

that the bullfighters fall in love

with.  And here I am, and

something is happening to me.

Strange noises in the night.

Paintings are calling to me.  And

all it cost to get there was five

gallons of gas.  I'm getting my

adventure.

MARROW

Someone is playing with you.

NELL

Why?

MARROW

I don't know.

NELL

It doesn't matter.  Even if

they're tormenting me, someone

wants me.  What I do with this is

up to me.  I can be a victim, or I

can be a volunteer.  And I want to

be the volunteer.

NELL (cont'd)

Hugh Crain.  Can't seem to get

away from him.

MARROW

What is that tune?

NELL

I don't know.  A lullaby I guess.

My mother used to hum it to me.

And her mother before that, and so

on.

(to the statue)

Hugh Crain, would you care to

dance?

NELL

Only two days.

NELL (cont'd)

The blest are the dead / Who see

not the sight / Of their own

desolation...

NELL (cont'd)

A father's joy unjustly snatch'd

by a jealous God...

NELL (cont'd)

Suffer the little children unto

me.

NELL

Crain's study.

NELL (cont'd)

Erin, Peter and Sean and Emily and

Elizabeth... who are you?  And

you?  What happened to you?  You

died... How did you die?

THEO

That's so sad.

NELL

There's hundreds of them.  This

must be a record of the children

who died at the mills, like Luke

said.

THEO

Before he painted your name over

Mister Crain.

NELL

You really think it was Luke?

THEO

Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley

had to clean it and he knows that

he's in charge of all the messes

so why would he make more work for

himself and...

(beat)

You said the Good Doctor was with

you.

NELL

(pondering)

I don't know what to think

anymore.

THEO

Just think about one thing right

now: What color?

NELL

I've never had a pedicure before.

THEO

Well?

NELL

Red.

(into this now)

What else?

THEO (cont'd)

See, isn't this better than a hit

on the head?

NELL

I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.

THEO

Me too.  Although I learned one

thing about you, that you don't

know about yourself.  You can be a

pretty decent bitch.

NELL

I'll take that as a compliment.

(beat, trying to

sound casual)

In the city, what kind of place do

you live in?

THEO

I have a loft.

NELL

A loft.  That's a lot of room for

one person.  Probably.  Maybe

there's room for...

THEO

You want to move to New York, you

want to move in with me?

NELL

I don't know, you know...

THEO

My place isn't like yours, Nell,

it doesn't have a view of sea.  It

doesn't have a view of anything.

What's interesting about the way I

live is what goes on inside the

walls.  Living with me... My

boundaries aren't very well

defined, Nell.  Do you know what I

mean?

NELL

I'm trying.  Have you ever kept

something to yourself because you

were afraid it'd ruin things.

THEO

All the time.

NELL (cont'd)

I better go to bed.

THEO

Are you sure?

NELL

I think so.

THEO

Okay.

THEO (OC)

Nell?  Nell!

NELL

Who is doing this to me?

THEO (OC)

Nell, what's wrong?  What's wrong?

THEO (OC) (cont'd)

Nell, it's locked, let me in!

THEO (OC)

Nell, the door is locked.  Open

it.

THEO (cont'd)

Nell...

THEO (cont'd)

Nell, the tub!

THEO

Oh, God, your breath...

THEO (cont'd)

It's here.

NELL

HELP!

NELL (cont'd)

No!  Go AWAY!

THEO

Marrow said the same thing as last

night, he

says

--

(meaning, this is

on his now

doubtful word)

-- that he checked with Mrs.

Dudley.  And he says that she told

him that all the fireplaces in the

West Wing connect to the main

chimney.  He says that he thinks

that the flue was open, and with

the windstorm, he says that what

probably happened was some kind of

freak air current --

NELL

-- What do you think?

LUKE

(lowers his voice)

Don't tell the Professor; he'd

probably throw me out.  But test

taking is one of the ways I've

been supporting myself.  I

volunteer for every paid study

that they offer.  Of course

straight psych stuff doesn't pay

as much as the pharmaceuticals do,

or a good wound study.  Check it

out.

LUKE (cont'd)

A thousand dollars each.  Am I

sick?  Yes.  Do you know why I

only date freshmen?  By the time

they're sophomores, they've

figured me out.

THEO

(get back on track!)

Mister very talky, would you

please say what it is about this

study that bothers you?

LUKE

The whole thing feels like

experimental misdirection.  Like

he says it's about one thing, a

psychological profile of

environmental effects on

insomnia... and that'd be a

legitimate study, but I think that

we've been subjected to an

academic bait and switch; he's

really looking at something else.

NELL

No.  No... Jim's not doing --

these things.

THEO

Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep

down, if you really thought it

wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be

leaving right this second?  Why

wouldn't you be afraid?  Really

afraid.

NELL

Because I don't want to ruin

things.  Because home is where the

heart is.

NELL

Jim?  I'm done.

MARROW (V.O.)

...the hallway discussion about

last night's fireplace incident

concluded at three a.m.  Nell

continues her alienation of the

other subjects and the

experimenter.  It remains unclear

whether she truly believes she did

not deface the painting.

Interview with the subject in

greenhouse yesterday to ascertain

the extent of her self-delusion

was inconclusive due to her

efforts to sexualize encounter

with experimenter.

MARROW (OC)

One minute!

MARROW (cont'd)

Nell.

MARROW (cont'd)

Were you looking for me?

MARROW (cont'd)

How are the tests going?

NELL

How can he think I'm doing this!

NELL (cont'd)

No.  No, I couldn't do those

things: I'm not making it up.

NELL (cont'd)

His second wife.  There was a

second wife?  Carolyn.

But something is wrong

.  It is another image of Carolyn and the

NELL (cont'd)

She was pregnant.

NELL

Theo!  Jim!  Help!

NELL

The house... it's a maze, that's

how you designed it, didn't you,

Mister Crain?  So wherever one of

your little guests went, the house

brought them here.  It's designed

to make you come here.  But why?

NELL (cont'd)

Oh, no... Oh... no... no, no...

not that... Oh no... Ohhhhhhhhh!

NELL (cont'd)

He hunted all those children in

here.  The dead children, Josiah

and Elizabeth and all of them...

from the books... he took them up

here... he played games... the

ones from his mills he burned them

up in the fireplace but she found

out what he did and she killed

him --

NELL (cont'd)

-- he didn't kill her she killed

him and ran away with her baby --

MARROW

Get a blanket!

THEO

It's okay... we're all here...

THEO (cont'd)

What's happening to her?

MARROW

She's in shock.  Come on.

NELL

After Rene... after she killed

herself... he turned into a

monster.  He did fill the house

with children... he did, but...

they weren't laughing...

THEO

Nell, what happened?

NELL

Carolyn showed me where she hid

him, hid him with all the ones he

killed --

MARROW

Nell... please, Nell... take a

deep breath...

NELL

And they're all locked together in

here... and he won't let go of

them!

MARROW

Nell!

MARROW (cont'd)

Look at me, Nell.  Look at me!

NELL

Hugh Crain.  He's in the house.

He's still here...

THEO

No.

MARROW

Theo!  You too.  Listen to me.

MARROW

Nell, you have to hear me.  Let me

explain what's happening to you.

(beat)

You're participating in a study on

hysteria.

MARROW (cont'd)

I've given you a powerful

suggestion that you're in a

haunted house.  I picked Hill

House because it fits the

expectations.  It was my... it was

my theater, my stage.

LUKE

Modelling small-group dynamics in

the formation of narrative

hallucinations.  You brought us

here to scare us.  Insomnia, that

was just a decoy issue.  You're

disgusting.

NELL

Is this true?  I've been

hypnotized?

MARROW

I hadn't done a study of how group

fear affects individual

performance.  Mass hysteria is

like a story, Nell.  A communal

story.  Someone starts it.  Then

we all add a little more to it.

And then for some reason -- no one

knows how -- we start believing

it.  This story shapes what we see

and hear.  We interpret everything

through it, make it fit the story.

I started our story when I gave

you the history of Hill House.

You've added to it.  That's what

this experiment has all been

about.  That's what it was about,

the experiment's over.  I'm

pulling the plug.  This is my

fault.

NELL

It's not real?  Crain?  He's not

real?

MARROW

Your fear of him was real.  That's

all the ghost anyone needs.

THEO

How could you do this to people?

NELL

This is real, I'm not making it

up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were

there -- the banging and last

night.  You, you all saw the

painting!

THEO

Nell, it makes sense.  It all

makes sense.  You and I, we were

scaring each other, working each

other up.

NELL

-- but the painting!

NELL (cont'd)

I know you think I did that.  I

didn't!  Go to the great hall and

look in the fireplace!

MARROW

Why would we want to do that,

Nell?

NELL

Because that's where he burned

them up, the child laborers from

his mills!  Because that's where

their bones are!  He killed

hundreds

.  He took them here and

he killed them.  Their bones are

in the fireplace!

MARROW

There are no bones in the

fireplace.  Luke and I looked in

it yesterday.  There's some old

charred wood in the ash drop

but --

MARROW (cont'd)

Nell!  If we look in that

fireplace it'll just make you more

upset.  And when there are no

bones there, you'll say they got

up and walked away.

NELL

Oh, God, you're not going to

look...

THEO

Aw, shhh Nell, shhh.

MARROW

There has to be Monster in the

Labyrinth.  We make them up.

That's how we deal with the things

in everyday life that are too

terrible to deal with.  Like

losing someone.  Like being alone.

MARROW (cont'd)

I'm sorry, Nell.  I'm really,

really sorry I did this to you.

LUKE

Sometimes saying you're sorry is

just not enough.

NELL

Don't leave me.

THEO

I'm going to stay with you until

you fall asleep.  And then I'm

going to get some brandy.

NELL

I don't think I want any.

THEO

I do.

MARROW

I gave my key to the gate to Todd,

but the Dudleys'll be here in the

morning.

LUKE

Do we still get paid for the week?

MARROW

You get your money.

MARROW (cont'd)

Where did she come up with it?

How did she put it all together?

LUKE

Is that the question of compassion

or science?

MARROW

It's a question.

LUKE

She got the child labor stuff from

me.

THEO

I... I was playing games with

her... Big city games... I was

bad.  And you, Doctor Morrow, you

broke her heart.

MARROW

Is she asleep?

THEO

Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't

let her alone the whole night.

MARROW

Shit.

(answering the

phone)

Hello?  Yes, this is Dr. Marrow.

(beat)

Oh, hello.  Thank you for

returning the call.

(beat)

No.  You mean he hasn't returned?

(long beat)

No, we haven't seen him.

(beat)

Can you tell me, what sort of car

does he drive?

(beat, reacting)

A Toyota...

THEO

We're fucked.  We're in a haunted

house and we can't get out until

the morning.

LUKE

You don't really believe it's

haunted... Do you believe in

ghosts?

THEO

That depends on your definition of

ghosts.  I'm going to check on

her, and then I'm going to stay

awake.

LUKE

All night?

THEO

Yeah.

LUKE

You want company?

THEO

Maybe someday.

NELL

Theo...

NELL (cont'd)

Oh, God.  It's looking for me.

NELL (cont'd)

Theo, my hand.  You're hurting me.

NELL (cont'd)

A child.  No.  No!  I'm right

HERE!

NELL (cont'd)

Oh, God.  Who was holding my hand?

NELL (cont'd)

I will not let you hurt a CHILD!

THEO

Nell?

THEO

Luke... Jim...!

The bottom half of her face is someone else's

.

her EYES are someone else's

, lit with insanity.

NELL

Why do you want

me

?

NELL (cont'd)

WHO AM I?

NELL (cont'd)

Welcome home, Eleanor...

NELL (cont'd)

No.

VOICES OF CHILDREN

Help us... help us...

NELL

I'm here... I'm here... I'm coming

to you, I'm coming to you...

MARROW (OC)

Nell!  Nell, are you in here?

LUKE (OC)

Look, the stairs!

MARROW

Nell!  Don't move.

LUKE

It's not going to hold your

weight.

MARROW

Just stay there, Nell!

MARROW (cont'd)

Damn it.

LUKE

Don't!

MARROW

Nell?  Are you up there?

MARROW (cont'd)

Come on, Nell.  You have to climb

over and step back on the stairs.

MARROW (cont'd)

Nell!  Now!

THEO

Nell, go with him!  Just go with

him.

NELL

The children want me.  They're

calling me.  They need me.

MARROW

Nell.  You will come here now.

NELL

NO!

MARROW

We're going down the stairs, Nell,

I'm taking you down the stairs.

THEO

She needs help.

MARROW

I'll take her with me to the

University tomorrow.  I can't

believe I read the test wrong.  I

didn't see anything that looked

like she was suicidal.

LUKE

You used the wrong test.

THEO

(indignant)

Will the two of you shut up!  God

damn it!  Maybe the tests were

right, Marrow.  She's sensitive,

she's vulnerable, but I don't

think she's suicidal and I didn't

have to test her.  Maybe she

wasn't trying to kill herself.

Maybe she was really scared.

Maybe she really heard voices.

LUKE

You're not telling us something.

MARROW

Watts.  Those were his keys Nell

found.  His roommate called and

said Watts left when he was

supposed to.  I think he's here.

THEO

He's wandering around the house,

and Nell heard him.  She thought

it was ghosts.  Let's go look for

him again.

MARROW

No.  If he's lost somewhere in the

house... he'll have to stay lost

until tomorrow, until the night is

over.  What we have to do now is

be together, with Nell.

LUKE

Oh my God...

MARROW

What is it?

MARROW (cont'd)

Help me!

THEO

Oh, Jesus.

MARROW

Wait a second!  Wait!

LUKE

No.

NELL

They're all in here.  All the ones

he killed.  They're just children!

We have to help them!

THEO

(to Marrow)

Come on!  Why are we waiting?

THEO

Oh my God we need to call someone?

MARROW

You okay?

NELL

Why did you bring me here?

NELL (cont'd)

Why did you call me and tell me to

look in the paper for the ad?

MARROW

Nell, what are you talking about?

I never called you.

NELL

But you told me to look in the

paper!  You told me I'd be

perfect!

MARROW

Nell, the first time I ever spoke

with you in person was the night

we met here.

NELL

Then who called me?

THEO

Nell --

LUKE

-- how much is this car worth?

LUKE

Get the hell out of the way!

THEO

Hurry.  The gas!  Luke... The gas!

LUKE

I'm okay.  Okay.  Just my chest.

Just my wind knocked out.

LUKE (cont'd)

Sorry about your car, Nell.

MARROW

Oh, no.

THEO

I'm sure she went back to her

room.

THEO

Was sure she'd be in here.

LUKE

(worried)

Where in the hell can she be.

MARROW

Oh no...

THEO

Nell?

MARROW

Oh my God it's Watts.

Just like Nell's sick room at home

.  Nell realizes it, covers her

THEO

Nell!

LUKE

We can't stay here looking for

her.  She doesn't want to be

found...

THEO

Nell?

MARROW

Nell.

THEO

What'd you come back for, babe?

NELL

Just had to be sure.

LUKE

Come on, Jesus!  Let's go!

THEO

Let's go, hon.  Don't you want to

go back to your little apartment

where you can hear the buoy out in

the harbor when the wind is just

right?

NELL

Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have

an apartment.

THEO

Then let's go get you one.

NELL

Don't worry about me, Theo.  I'm

wanted.  Right here.  I'm home.

NELL (cont'd)

After all...

(beat)

I'm family.

MARROW

No.

NELL

My mother used to hum this to me.

Like her mother hummed it to her.

And my great grandmother Carolyn

hummed it to her.

NELL (cont'd)

I have to stay.  You better go.  I

could explain it, but you'd never

understand.

MARROW

Come on.

NELL

No --

THEO

Please, Nell, just see us out.

NELL

In the night...

NELL (cont'd)

...In the dark.

LUKE

No you bastard!  Break!

NELL

It's not safe for you anymore.

The children need me, and Crain is

doing everything he can to keep me

from them.

MARROW

Come on.

LUKE

Watch out!

THEO

Hurry!

MARROW

They don't open!

MARROW (cont'd)

Oh Jesus my hand.

NELL

Give me your shoelace.

MARROW

What'll happen to us, Nell?

NELL

Nothing, if you leave right now.

There's a war going on all around

us.  Don't get in the way, please.

LUKE

Shit!  All right, you

sonofabitch...

LUKE

Maybe this'll get your attention!

MARROW

Luke!

LUKE

What?

LUKE (cont'd)

We'll get out after this wing

burns down.  Let's go.

NELL

(to the house, to

Crain)

No!  No!  Let them go!

MARROW

Luke.

THEO

Oh God, we can't get out!

MARROW

Nell, what do we do?

NELL

He played hide and seek with the

children.  That's how he built the

house.

MARROW

We can't hide in here!  We won't

make it til morning.

NELL

I know.

NELL (cont'd)

No, no, you leave them alone!

NELL

Hurry.

NELL

Jim!  Theo!

THEO

Nell!  There you --

NELL

Nooo, not them!

NELL (cont'd)

Is this where she bashed your

brains in?

NELL (cont'd)

When you came in the door?  I bet

that was the last thing you

expected.  Right?  From

Carolyn

?

(beat)

You thought, oh, Carolyn, I've

taken it all out of her, you

thought, Oh, Carolyn, she's no

threat.  Carolyn.  Great Grandma

Carolyn.  Did you know that?

NELL (cont'd)

She found out what you did, and

she knew there was only one way to

stop you.  And she stopped you, so

you couldn't torture anymore of

the living.

(beat)

But you wouldn't even let go of

the dead, would you?  Well, now

I'm here.  They called me.  Did

you know that?  They've been

crying out for help for a long

time.  And I heard them.

NELL (cont'd)

And I won't let you hurt them

anymore.

NELL (cont'd)

Come on, Hugh Crain, you know what

to do.  We've both been here

before.

THEO

NELL!

MRS. DUDLEY

(her final verdict)

City people.

MR. DUDLEY

You find out what you wanted to

know, mister?

THEO

I'm not going back to New York

City.  I'm going to find an

apartment with a little flower

garden, where you can just see the

ocean and at night, when the wind

comes in just right, you can hear

the sound of the harbor.  What

about you?

MARROW

I'm a scientist.  I just conducted

an experiment.  Now I have to

write it up.

THEO

But the experiment was a failure.

MARROW

Was it?

FADE OUT.

ALTERNATE ENDING

MRS. DUDLEY

(her final verdict)

City people.

MR. DUDLEY

You find out what you wanted to

know, mister?

WE DISSOLVE TO:

PRINTER

(has to shout)

First copy!

PRINTER (cont'd)

(reads)

This book is dedicated to Eleanor

Vance, Luke Sanderson, Rene Crain

and Carolyn Crain.

(to Marrow)

They'll be happy to see this.

Their names in a book, it kind of

makes them immortal, doesn't it?

MARROW

In a way.

THEO

Nell?... Nell?

FADE OUT.
