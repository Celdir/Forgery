KLUTE

Klute. With a K. K - L - U -

ROSS

Are you with plant security,

Sergeant?

KLUTE

(shakes head)

Town Police.

ROSS

Then how are you involved?

KLUTE

(slowly)

I know Tom Grunemann.

ROSS

(shortcutting again)

You knew the subject Thomas

Grunemann. How well?

KLUTE

We grew up together. Kids.

ROSS

Can you account for his

disappearance in any way?

KLUTE

No.

ROSS

Did he recently appear to you

agitated or depressed?

(aside to younger Agent,

recording)

-- indicates no -- Did he voice to

you grievance or discontent with

his research work here? Indicates

no. Moral or sexual problems or

peculiarities? --

KLUTE

No.

ROSS

Marital problems in general?

Indicates possibly -- am I right

Sergeant?

KLUTE

Everybody's got some, I guess.

ROSS

Did he ever mention specifically a

girl or woman in New York?

KLUTE

No.

ROSS

Examine this letter please.

(continues)

We recovered that from the shredder

-- the plant disposal and

incinerator system. Grunemann

apparently typed it Friday, before

he left, decided not to send it,

tossed it away. We've already

contacted the New York Police; they

think they know the girl in

question.

ROSS (CONT'D)

He never mentioned this type thing

to you? You didn't know he had

these interests?

HOLLY

My husband was not like that! My

God, Klute.

KLUTE

It looks like he sent her quite a

few of those Holly -- the girl --

she recalls six or seven letters

like --

HOLLY

(calmly)

-- No. I mean sure a little rough

stuff, but just what people usually

-- No, I would've said we were

pretty good.

(pause)

Johnnie I don't understand. I just

don't understand.

ROSS

-- has disclosed no evidence of

crime or criminal intent within the

jurisdiction of this bureau, and

since subject Thom --

CABLE

(turns sharply,

interrupts)

It's been almost a year! Tom

Grunemann's been missing for a

year. And all the FBI has to offer

is a report that must bore even

you.

ROSS

(restraint)

Well sir.

STREIGER

Are you closing the case?

ROSS

No sir, we don't state that. We're

countin --

CABLE

But you don't find it worth much

effort.

ROSS

(injured dignity)

Well Mr. Cable, you've got me here

from the Bureau. You got Lieutenant

Trask here from New York

representing his department and I

don't frankly consider --

STREIGER

(moderating, suggesting)

Why couldn't you ever find out

anything from the girl?

ROSS

(refers the question)

Trask --

TRASK

(summarizes from notes)

We first hold her under

surveillance expectin your boy

Grunemann to show up there. Didn't.

Then we bagged -- we arrested her

on a CP charge, convicted, two

month's women's city prison, offer

to reduce sentence, she cooperated.

(counts)

Four interrogations. She thought

she remembered Grunemann -- from

those letters from before, she made

that connection -- but she hadn't

seen him since and couldn't

identify his photograph and she --

STREIGER

Why not?

TRASK

Oh a good call girl, she'll turn

six-seven hundred tricks a year.

The faces get blurred.

(resumes)

And since then, recent months,

she's reported several, you know,

incidents: like breather calls,

anonymous phone calls, also

somebody maybe following her,

watching her, things like that. So

it's I guess you could say,

conceivable Grunemann's still

around there, just hangin around

her, spooking her. But you know,

that --

ROSS

The subject got emotionallv

disturbed; he just dropped out.

There's thousands.

STREIGER

Inspector we understand your

position; ours is a little

different. We have an investment in

Tom Grunemann. The Company has an

investment, and we feel entitled to

investigate for ourselves.

ROSS

Private investigation, you mean.

Yes sir, of course you're entitled,

and there's some very competent --

STREIGER

Klute offered us his services;

we've accepted.

STREIGER (CONT'D)

Klute knew Tom. He has a great many

ideas about the case --

ROSS

(sourly)

Yes sir, we know he --

STREIGER

We'd expect him to work in

cooperation with you. He'd report

to each of you and to our Company's

New York office, to Pete -- Pete

goes there on a regular schedule

back and forth, and --

ROSS

(tactfully)

Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly --

we've appreciated the Sergeant's

interest you know, all along. Here,

locally. But New York, that's -

well --

TRASK

(to Klute, leniently)

Ever done any missing person's

work?

ROSS

Spent much time in the city?

(to others)

You see, I have to wonder --

speaking frankly; the Sergeant

knows I'm only speaking frankly -

CABLE

You wonder why we thought of Klute?

Frankly? He's interested.

DIRECTOR (O.S.)

(hastily)

Honey, no, we don't have too many.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

Now before it comes to that, let's

have a look, et cetera, et cetera --

OK -

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

-- Honey you make it look a little

real. It should have, you know,

that fun to it.

(beat)

BREE

Strangle him to death funny?

DIRECTOR

Well we go from this into stomach

diagrams. It can't be too -- look

let's try it again from -

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

No -- just give us the faces at the

end, would you?

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

(reads)

-- And another family saved by Elso

tablets. OK --

(brightly)

Thank you very much.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

Pierce -- Danner -

BREE

Bree Daniel, any messages?

(waits -- none)

OK, thanks.

BREE (CONT'D)

Trina? Bree. Do I? Oh no, just a

commercial I thought I might get,

that's all.

(quickly, more brightly)

Well I'd take a quick thirty, hon.

Do you have a commuter for me?

Wait.

BREE

Hullo.

BREE (CONT'D)

Ooh, I knew I'd like you.

BREE

Lover, that's got to be a little

extra. I mean it sounds very

exciting, what you speak of, you've

got me all excited. But something

special like that, you know it's

got to cost a little more, mm?

BREE

(through door, curtly)

What is it?

KLUTE (O.S.)

Miss Daniel? My name is Klute --

John Klute --

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Can I talk to you?

BREE

What about?

KLUTE

My name's John Klute.

BREE

You said that.

KLUTE

I'm an investigator. I'd like to

ask you some questions about Tom

Grunemann.

BREE

Who?

KLUTE

Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some

letters.

BREE

(innocently)

Gee.

KLUTE

He was a research engineer at the

Tuscarora Laboratories in

Pennsylvania. He disappeared from

there last April. I've been hired

to look for him.

BREE

Why?

KLUTE

You know what I'm talking about.

Miss Daniel.

BREE

Honest?

KLUTE

Will you let me ask you some

questions?

BREE

(gumbo-southern)

Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?

BREE (CONT'D)

You're not police or FBI; you're

just a private investigator?

KLUTE

Mm.

BREE

And you just want to ask me a few

questions?

KLUTE

Mm.

BREE

-- and I take acting classes with

Lee Tainter --

AGENT

-- Lee, yes --

BREE

-- and I was in two of his workshop

type productions, Uncle Vanya and

the girl in Five Characters --

(indicates picture)

-- here -- and then of course I

have the modeling and the

demonstrator work, the trade-fair

work -- but naturally I feel ready

for something more, well you know,

sustain --

AGENT

Well, thanks very much for coming

in.

BREE

(beautifully -- the

business)

Thank you very much.

TRASK (V.O.)

Man, just a poor pretty little

hooker, like to be an actress --

TRASK (V.O.)

What you lookin' to get from her?

You think she's got Grunemann hid

somewhere, the attic, feedin him

soup? Or maybe he's hidin in a dark

alley and he'll jump on her and you

jump on him. And third place, even

if she does know somethin' she's

right, she don't have to talk to

you. You don't have police power,

you can't make her.

KLUTE

That's a lot of people to die

unknown.

TRASK

Unknown, unidentified and unwanted.

And there's more every day man,

there's more everyday.

BREE VOICE

Bree Daniel.

(then)

Yeah, hi hon.

BREE

Oh hon, I just don't know. I'm

trying to stay out of it.

GIRL'S VOICE

maybe two or three times a year,

and five big ones baby, just one

evening.

BREE VOICE

Marta, thanks, and I'd love to

party with you hon, but --

BREE

Well try to get someone else Marty

and if I change my mind -- sure

hon, bye.

BREE VOICE

Bree Daniel --

MAN'S VOICE

Oh God baby, oh God I really love

you.

BREE VOICE

That's nice; who is this?

MAN'S VOICE

I really love you baby, you know

Hello? Hello? Oh my God, hello?

BREE VOICE

2ND MAN'S VOICE

Bree -- Frank Hanley, you remember,

Fayetterville?

BREE VOICE

Oh yeah, hi Frank, sure.

2ND MAN'S VOICE

Well I'm in town, like to see you.

BREE VOICE

Well Frank that's awful nice but

I'm out of action, sort of, you

know --

SPANGLER (V.O.)

Bree Daniel, Caucasian, twenty

eight, good physical health, no

narcotics record, presenting an

unusually strong personality some

ways, high intelligence, a high

bracket call girl.

SPANGLER

-- Usual case history -- this isn't

a medical confidence, it's all of

them -- broken family, lonely,

confused, crummy childhood, early

promiscuity, formal prostitution

beginning in her teens, income

twenty-five to thirty thousand a

year.

(notes Klute's reaction)

Oh they don't keep the money: they

get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?

(stabs at record)

Why do you want to know all this?

KLUTE

I want to know how Tom Grunemann

got mixed up in it.

SPANGLER

Not unusual.

KLUTE

Did she talk about him to you?

SPANGLER

About his letters -- that's all she

remembered. Quite violent material,

I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick

man. But that's not unusual either.

KLUTE

Has she talked with you since

prison?

SPANGLER

No. She had every good intention of

it -- coming to me as a private

patient, getting out of the life,

devoting herself to an acting

career.

KLUTE

I think she's trying that.

SPANGLER

Oh sure they try. The idea of a

better life.  But they don't really

know much about life: They get

confused -- or scared or frustrated

or bored -- they pop back to the

one thing they can handle.

The trick. The trick. Men in bed.

Not men in general, not life, not

love, not even real sex -- it

avoids all that. Just the trick,

the transaction.

MAN

(tapping her)

We had a bet on - if you were real

or not. I won.

BREE

(on phone)

Marta --

BREE

Hi. Bree.

(is greeted)

Hi. Well I could come over tonight

- if you'd like -- if there's no

one else.

(laughs diffidently)

I really want to just talk to you.

BREE

Hi? -_

BREE (CONT'D)

Oh --

BREE (CONT'D)

You scared me, Mr. Faber.

MR. FABER

Good material, not too good cut.

I'd do better for you.

BREE

Oh thank you.

MR. FABER

Enjoy.

(then)

Well --

BREE

(diffident)

It's good to see you. Well -- could

we do it first and then just talk?

MR. FABER

Sure dear, yes.

BREE

Well -- well I'm just back. And --

I must tell you -- something quite

wonderful.

MR. FABER

(intently)

Yes?

BREE

And Cannes was quite fun, quite;

and we played baccarat and

chemindefer and there was a nice

little Italian marquis quite

enthusiastic for me -- but a young

man can be so silly --

MR. FABER

Mm.

BREE

And then one night -- at the gaming

tables -- well I just saw him. A

stranger -- looking at me -- and I

knew suddenly that all my life I'd

been --

BREE (CONT'D)

-- May I? It's so --

MR. FABER

(quickly)

Please --

BREE

Not young; he wasn't young -- gray

at the temples, he -- well actually

he looked like you.

MR. FABER

(tensely)

Yes?

BREE

And nobody could tell me who he was

-- an exiled prince or a mercenary

or a bullfighter or -- but I felt

it stirring inside me, this -- this

wild, pagan feeling --

BREE

And next day at the beach -- our

beach pavilion -- I saw him again,

his eyes burning into me. I was

helpless. Without his even speaking

to me, without his even touching, I

knew that somehow -- somehow --

BREE

Whyn't you just cut out?

BREE

Oh you bastard.

BREE (CONT'D)

Is it the shakedown hon? You picked

a loser, I just don't have it.

KLUTE

No, I'm look --

BREE

(vehemently again)

If I was taking calls full time

would I be living in this kip? I'd

be back on Park Avenue; I could

support the whole National Guard!

KLUTE

(gestures upward)

Could I ask some questions?

BREE

Or you'll get me shoved back in the

brig you mean; another month with

the bull-dykes.

BREE

Look, I told the police everything:

I don't even remember the schlub!

BREE

They showed me that one. I

understand it's Grunemann, but I

told them, I just don't remember.

BREE

(cool)

A family sort of man.

KLUTE (V.O.)

-- Tom, again.

KLUTE

Company outing or picnic or

something like that.

BREE

Isn't that sweet.

(then)

Well it could be any one of them

bubi; I get to see them all.

BREE (CONT'D)

Look -- please -- will you just try

to get it from my side? A year ago.

I was in the life fulltime. I was

living on Park with leather

furniture and a million dresses.

Then they dropped on me, the fuzz,

they caged me -- they started

asking me about a man, some man,

I'm supposed to have seen a year

before that. Two years ago, two. He

could be in Yemen!

BREE (CONT'D)

A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And

they showed me pictures like this

and they meant nothing. Then they

asked me, well had I been getting

letters, from someone out there in

Cabbageville --

KLUTE

-- Tuscarora --

BREE

All right, yes, I had been. Those

sick, wild letters -- I'm watching

you, gonna follow you, gonna punish

you, kill you et cetera. Well, they

said, all right that's Grunemann.

So try to remember when you and he

- when -- well I don't know, there

was that dumper once, he sounded

like that dumper --

(explains)

Dumpers; they get their kicks

beating you up. A man hired me

once, then tried to really kill me

- that'd be about two years ago.

BREE (CONT'D)

(shouts)

OK Tommy-baby, Allie-Allie-in-free

kid, I got the gumdrops.

BREE (CONT'D)

You remind me of my uncle.

KLUTE

What?

(then --)

What do you remember about that --

dumper?

BREE

Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding.

Usually it's a fakeout, you

probably know. They pretend to tie

you up, and you wear a dress with a

cloth belt and they pretend to whip

you or you --

(beat)

Hell it's their money. I'll hang

from the shower rod and whistle

Maytime. Except this guy was really

tripped out on it; he --

KLUTE

But you can't say that Dumper was

Tom Grunemann.

BREE

I can't say he was anybody!

BREE (CONT'D)

So -- OK -- that's all?

BREE (CONT'D)

Well could I have them back now

hon? -- those tape recordings

you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and

if you want you can have a good

time and I'll have a good time and--

KLUTE

What about everything since?

KLUTE (CONT'D)

(prompts)

Everything that's happened since

Tom Grunemann disappeared. The

phone calls and the --

BREE

Just phone calls, right? They ring,

you answer, they don't say

anything, just blank. Kids getting

kicks. Burglars looking for an

empty apartment. I mean there is

nothing that proves --

KLUTE

What about the other things you've

reported? --

(consulting notes)

-- being followed on the --

BREE

(interrupts -- awkwardly)

Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led

everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get

those feelings, but that's just me,

that's just feelings.

(beat)

I'm sure this will amuse you;

I'm scared of the dark. And

sometimes I get shook up, I hear

people or -- well, I'll come out in

the morning and think someone's

been prying at my mailbox, or

there's a little -- trash outside

my door and I wonder if someone

left it there for -- do you see? --

things other people wouldn't even

notice. Well that's not real, it's

just nerves; it's got nothing to do

with --

BREE (CONT'D)

Bree Daniel.

(listens. Brightly)

Oh yes, Ted Carlin, how is Ted?

(listens)

Oh, well, thank you very much but

maybe the next time you're in town?

(listens)

Well I just love Ted and I'd love

to meet you -- you have a very nice

voice -- but I just --

(listens, grows impatient)

Well I'm having a chat with a very

nice cop. Actually not a real cop;

he's a private inves --

KLUTE

Is that how you get most of your

dates? Someone gives your name to

someone else?

BREE

Most of them.

KLUTE

Is that how you met the Dumper? --

Someone else gave --

BREE

How would I remember?

KLUTE

How else do you meet them? Pimps?

(a beat)

BREE

(patient)

You're very square. Pimps don't get

you dates, cookie; they just take

the money.

KLUTE

I have some names the police gave

me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell

me what --

BREE

(trembling)

Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you

too. Ilia trying to get away from

all that.

KLUTE

What about the old gentleman the

other night, Mr. Faber?

BREE

You saw that, goddamn you? You saw

it? He's seventy. His wife's dead.

He started cutting garments at

fourteen. His whole life, he's

maybe had a week's vacation, I'm

all he has and he never, never

touches me, and what harm in it,

what --

BREE (CONT'D)

Klute, tell me, what's your bag?

Are you a talker, or a button man

or a doubler, or maybe you like

them very young -- children -- or

get your chest walked around with

high-heeled shoes, or have us watch

you tinkle? Or --

KLUTE

(under)

-- OK --

BREE

-- You want to wear women's

clothes, or you get off ripping

things --

BREE (CONT'D)

-- you perverted hypocrite square

bastards.

KLUTE

OK.

BREE

Gee I hope this doesn't make my

cold any worse.

KLUTE

Tell me about Frank Ligourin.

BREE

(casual, pleasant)

Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke

up.

KLUTE

When?

(beat)

When did you and Ligourin break up?

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Mind not doing that?

BREE

What? This?

KLUTE

-- OK?

BREE

(ingenuously)

I thought you could trick me for

those tapes. Don't you get lonely

in that little green room? Or let

me get you someone; I have terrific

friends, wild.

KLUTE

No thanks.

BREE

Gee. I've had men pay two hundred

dollars for me -- here, you're

turning down a freebie.

(pause)

You can get a perfectly good

dishwasher for that.

BREE (CONT'D)

You've changed your mind? You do

want to play?

KLUTE

(quietly, steadily)

I don't want you to look up.

There's someone on the skylight.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Easy -- pretend you're looking here-

(more insistently)

-- here.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Now I'm going to walk around -- you

just keep talking, straight

through, straight through.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Tell me about acting -- what are

you doing tomorrow -- where do you

go?

BREE

(manages, barely)

I go on rounds.

KLUTE

Rounds, what are they? -- don't

watch me, keep talking.

BREE

You go see agents -- or Equity

calls, open casting calls. And ad

agencies -- commercials -- you

don't get work, you just go around.

BREE (CONT'D)

And they're always polite -- show

people -- they say thank you very

much. You lie there covered with

blood, smiling, they say --

KLUTE

I couldn't get him.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

It's all right.

BREE

Well do you think it was him?

KLUTE

What do you think?

BREE

Can't you get him?

KLUTE

Maybe, if you tell me the things

you haven't.

BREE

(pause)

You asked me where I got that date

with the dumper -- Frank sent me on

it.

KLUTE

Do you know where he got the

dumper?

BREE

He never told me.

KLUTE

Well, let's go down and ask him.

BREE

What did you expect? Frankie still

has a good string, three girls.

Figure three hundred a week from

each.

KLUTE

Is that what you gave him?

FRANK

Bree -- hi -- come in, come in.

BREE

Frank -- Klute.

FRANK

(shakes hands)

Hi. Come in.

(leads them in, indicating

table)

I was just catching up some work --

mocking up the photographs.

(to Klute)

I used to be a photographer myself

- Bree tell you? -- Before I got in

the publishing.

BREE

Frank, he knows you're a pimp. He

knows you were my pimp.

FRANK

Well Bree, maybe you'd rather --

FRANK

How's it been?

FRANK (CONT'D)

With me Bree it's eternally the

same. Toward you. I guess you know

that.

BREE

Yeah Frank, I know that.

FRANK

I've always respected Bree.

(then)

I'd like to make something clear.

KLUTE

I've just got a few --

FRANK

I'd like to make something clear. I

don't go after a girl; a girl comes

to me. Her choice. Right?

KLUTE

I'm looking for a man. Tom

Grunemann.

(no response, whatever)

Bree thinks he may have been the

dumper -- that call she had two

years ago. She says you sent her on

it.

FRANK

Two years ago? Sorry.

KLUTE

They tell me you use narcotics.

Could I bring someone around to

look at your arms?

FRANK

Look -- dad -- I may stand better

with the cops than you.

FRANK (CONT'D)

OK, a family matter. Between the

girls. I had two other cows --

(corrects himself)

-- two other girls besides Bree.

KLUTE

She told me.

FRANK

OK and one of them  Jane McKenna --

she blows a little jealous of Bree

- you know? -- Bree comes first?

And evidently she knew the freak ---

that he was a dumper -- she conned

me into passing him to Bree, you

know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't

know. Till afterwards.

KLUTE

Why didn't you tell Bree,

afterwards?

FRANK

(a little shocked)

You don't tell them. That one of

their own in-laws laid a dumper on

them?

(shakes head)

Peace in the family.

(pause)

Beyond that, I don't know. All she

wrote.

KLUTE

I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.

FRANK

(smiles)

Would I be telling you all this?

She copped out long ago. She

committed suicide Baxter.

BREE

Did you like my friend Frankie?

KLUTE

No.

BREE

Didn't he tell you what you wanted?

KLUTE

It didn't go anywhere.

(then)

But that's not why --

BREE

About the dumper, didn't he tell

you that?

KLUTE

It was Jane McKenna who sent you

the dumper.

BREE

(coldly)

Well -- she's dead.

BREE (CONT'D)

I thought you were going back to

the apartment.

KLUTE

(he shakes his head)

You said you wanted these.

BREE

Oh golly, oh just what I've always

dreamed of, dirty phone calls.

(then)

How come?

KLUTE

You told me what you could. I guess

I'm through with your part of it.

BREE

(grudgingly)

Is there anything more I could --

KLUTE

I don't see anything, do you?

BREE

What're you gonna do next?

KLUTE

Try some other ways.

(starts off)

BREE

What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for

that clown to fall through the

skylight on me?

KLUTE

And I don't think that was Tom.

BREE

You said it was!

KLUTE

No, I said what did you think.

BREE

Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said

that just to keep me scared. So I'd

tell you everything I -- oh clever;

oh you smart, tricky hick.

KLUTE

Well --

BREE

(harshly)

Hey, but did we get to you, Klute?

A little?

KLUTE

Yeah, you got to me.

BREE

-- Us city folks? The sin, the

glitter, the wickedness?

KLUTE

Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it

was more -- I don't know --

(hunts the word)

-- too bad? Pathetic?

BREE

Goodbye.

BREE

What the hell do you mean,

pathetic?

KLUTE

It's kind of late.

BREE

It got lonely upstairs. There's

someone on the roof.

BREE (CONT'D)

Oh, don't be a doo-doo.

KLUTE

Not much point to this, is there?

BREE

(placidly)

Ezra, I'm lots better than you're

used to. Tell me -- the other

night, watching me with Mr. Faber --

wasn't your tongue a little bit

hanging out?

KLUTE

Mm.

BREE

So you're not too different from

him, or the chap on the roof, or

Tommy-baby --

BREE (CONT'D)

Look, if you don't use it somebody

else just will. And you've done

your whole bit with me, your entire

duty, and so now this is my thing.

So enjoy, Mr. Faber would say,

enjoy.

KLUTE

Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.

BREE

Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do

you really like other kicks? Is it

more just having power over

someone? -- so you don't really

need to --

BREE (CONT'D)

Who the hell are you, buttoning me

up?

QUICK

DISSOLVE --

DISSOLVE --

BREE

I knew it, I knew it, a killer.

DISSOLVE --

BREE

Oh lover -- oh you thrill me -- oh,

it's beautiful -- oh yes, yes -- oh

like that, like that, yes --

DISSOLVE --

BREE (CONT'D)

What's the matter hon? You were

great. Terrific. A tiger.

KLUTE

Thanks.

BREE

Well what're you down about? You

mean because you didn't get me

there?

(pause, comfortingly)

You can't expect that. I mean

Frank, yes, he'd get me there all

the time -- but never with a John.

BREE (CONT'D)

And I'm sorry I can't stay and

learn your special little games.

And I certainly don't want you to

feel bad about this -- losing your

virtue all of a sudden -- because I

sort of knew you would. As I said,

like everyone, right?

BREE (CONT'D)

Besides - you can always tell

yourself you made me come

downstairs. Ta, luv.

BREE

-- Why?

BREE (CONT'D)

Why -- please, why? -- Why lose,

why look? Why hate and give and

want and love? Why get, grieve, g --

JANG

(loudly, cheerfully)

Thank you very much.

BREE

-- gug -- gug --

BREE (CONT'D)

Why? -- I want to know what.

JANG

(laughs tolerantly)

No, that was very good everybody.

Do we have all your resumes?

PRODUCER

(from list)

Booth -- Osman -- Zuff -- Anjeris

Chaka.

KLUTE

You asked if there was anything

more you could help me with.

BREE

When?

KLUTE

I've checked the records of Jane

McKenna's death -- I can't get

anything special. But Frank

Ligourin had another girl you said,

besides McKenna and you.

BREE

Arlyn Page.

KLUTE

Did she and Jane McKenna know each

other?

BREE

Frankie kept them in the same

apartment: it cut his travel-time.

KLUTE

Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the

Dumper too.

BREE

Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin

- she's the one who started Frank.

She's strung out now; you won't

find her.

KLUTE

You could help me find her. You

know the people.

(as she turns away)

I'll pay you a hundred dollars.

BREE

I can make that in a lunch break!

(then)

Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't

just me? -- you decided you liked

it, after all, the other night;

you'll hang around for seconds?

KLUTE

Don't worry.

BREE

Joanie -- Mike, hi --

(to another, a Negro girl)

Hi Pat.

PAT

(giggles)

Hey Bree honey, who you got?

BREE

A new daddy. I'n he cute?

BREE (CONT'D)

Trina this is Klute. I told you

about him.

TRINA

Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both

join me?

(as they sit)

And how do you like our fair city?

There's so much here don't you

think? The museums and the books

and the foreign films -- Bree, have

you seen the Godard film?

BREE

Uh uh.

TRINA

Oh you've got to. He does such fun

things with imagery. And I've been

reading The Fall --

(to Klute, enunciating

carefully)

-- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo --

it's the same thing, you know the

imagery --

BREE

(patiently)

Trina honey, he just wants to find

Arlyn Page.

TRINA

Why? She's a junkie.

BREE

(prods gently)

She was with you after she left

Frank.

TRINA

Well she's not now.

(then quavering --)

I did everything for Arlyn. I loved

Arlyn I took her right into my

apartment, my own sweet apartment

on First. But she wouldn't stay off

it -- the junk -- and I wept and I

pleaded and I held her in my arms -

and she started taking things, my

things, and selling them for horse.

My clothes.

We could've had everything

together, everything -- and then

the bitch sold

my mink!

FIRST GIRL

Arlyn Page?

SECOND GIRL

You'll never catch up; she's

grooved out.

BREE

Gil?

KLUTE

I'm not looking for her personally

- someone she might know about.

PIMP

(shrugs; to Bree)

Try Janie Dale.

JANIE DALE

(to girl on couch)

It's old Mr. Clean from Cleveland.

He wants to know when he can fly in

and clean up the apartment and see

you. I told him I have all the

cleaning equipment and that he can

come anytime, but it's up to you.

GIRL

You know he wants us to be

dominant.

JANIE DALE

Tell him that he'd better have his

ass in here by one o'clock on

Monday afternoon or you won't let

him clean the bathroom floor, and

tell him the price has gone up

twenty bucks -- Old Dutcn

Cleanser's not as cheap as it used

to be.

JANIE DALE (CONT'D)

You wanted to know about Arlyn,

honey? I had to let her go dear.

Arlyn stopped being reliable.

(explains to Klute)

I deal with a high type client,

business people, you understand? I

can't send them someone that's all

the time half zonked out.

KLUTE

Do you know where she went?

JANIE DALE

Try Momma Reese.

MOMMA REESE

Try Bill Azure. If you can find

him.

AZURE

-- a couple weeks then she'd drift

off a couple of weeks, you know

what I mean?

KLUTE

Have you heard from her recently?

AZURE

She liked me all right but she had

what she liked better, you know

what I mean?

KLUTE

Have you heard from her recently?

PROPRIETRESS

-- She'd come in and I'd let her

have something. Why not; she'd been

a good customer, a beautiful

person, a beautiful beautiful

person.

MRS. VASEK

The whore, yeah. I threw out.

KLUTE

Do you know where she went from

here?

MRS. VASEK

Live like animals. Her and the man.

Out.

KLUTE

(reacts)

Was she living with a man?

KLUTE

What's the matter?

BREE

(glances about)

What the hell do you think's the

matter.

(then suggests)

I could wait for you someplace.

KLUTE

If Arlyn Page is living with Tom

Grunemann --

BREE

(eagerly)

-- Then you don't need me.

KLUTE

But if it's someone else I do.

BREE

You sure pull a lot of mileage out

of a hundred dollars.

ARLYN (O.S.)

Cappy?

BREE

Arlyn? Honey?

(then)

Look, it's all right.

BERGER (O.S.)

Is it Cappy? Cappy? --

BREE

Arlyn, it's all right.

BERGER

Cappy, I got a radio!

ARLYN

No --

ARLYN (CONT'D)

Bree -- honey - please, we're

waiting for someone.

BREE

Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some

questions -- something you could

help us about.

ARLYN

Can't you see I'm strung out?

(cries out)

Please, we're waiting for it --

he's got to have it!

KLUTE

We'll go. Just something you could

tell us, first.

BREE

Honey, a couple of years ago, with

Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a

Dumper --

ARLYN

Please, if he sees you, he won't

come!

BREE

Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have

a dumper, one of her regular Johns?

ARLYN

What about him? Yes.

BREE

Did he come around often?

ARLYN

No. He was an older man hon. The

dumper was older.

KLUTE

Do you remember his name? What can

you tell me about him?

BERGER (O.S.)

(shouts desperately)

Arlyn, get them out.

ARLYN

Please, I am begging you.

KLUTE

It's important.

ARLYN

That's not the Dumper, that's all!

He was an older man!

KLUTE

Can you give me any more

description than that?

ARLYN

Cappy? --

ARLYN (CONT'D)

It's all right, they're all right --

BERGER (O.S.)

Cappy? -- Cappy?

BERGER (CONT'D)

Cappy it's all right! I got a radio

-- don't run, don't --

ARLYN

Oh baby -- no it's all right -- oh

my baby baby baby --

ARLYN (CONT'D)

Get out!

(to Berger, again)

Don't cry my baby; I'll find him,

I'll get it. Baby, baby, don't cry.

(to Klute savagely,

incoherently)

Leave us alone! Get out and get out

and leave us alone!

(to Berger)

My honey, my baby, my baby --

CABLE

She wouldn't be reliable anyhow --

a narcotics addict.

KLUTE

I believed her, Pete.

TRASK

He's right you know. Waiting for

the pusher, she'd tell you

anything.

KLUTE

I believed her: the Dumper was not

Tom Grunemann.

CABLE

All right, suppose it wasn't Tom

Grunemann; where does that get you?

KLUTE

(smiles ruefully)

It's where it doesn't get me. I've

got nothing left that connects to

anything.

CABLE

Then, close the case.

KLUTE

I better keep looking.

CABLE

Where, how?

KLUTE

(the best he can offer)

I could try Arlyn Page again. She

saw much more of the Dumper than

Bree Daniel.

CABLE

You just finished telling me she

had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you

said, the Dumper was clearly not

Tom.

KLUTE

It's got to make sense some way.

SECRETARY

Mr. Cable -- they are meeting in

Mr. Camara's office.

CABLE

Yes Evvie, thanks. Gentlemen, I'm

sorry.

CABLE (CONT'D)

I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania

Friday; I'll fill them in on

things.

KLUTE

How is it back there?

CABLE

I think you're homesick.

(reflects)

I'll be out at my camp over the

weekend. Nice right now, that touch

of fall in the air, that skim of

frost in the early mornings, very

peaceful.

(briskly again)

John, I'll be back here again

Thursday; I'll be in touch.

Lieutenant, thank you.

TRASK

(toward Klute)

They were bringing a freighter down

through Kill Van Kull; propellers

washed it up on top.

SUGARMAN

Why didn't you bring it up on deck?

DECKHAND

Would you bring it up on deck?

DECKHAND (CONT'D)

(to other)

Mickey, get something. Get the eels

off.

SPENCE

(calmly)

They'll drop off theirselves when

she comes out.

TRASK

It'll go to the Examiner. But I

don't see nothin that means nothin.

SUGARMAN

You help us with ID? We can't get

nothin from him.

KLUTE

Arlyn Page was probably an alias.

She went by the names Terry Arlyn

and June Price. She may have been

from Pittsburgh, someone told me. I

can give you a list of people who

knew her, if that would help to --

SUGARMAN

No point, thanks.

KLUTE

Is he claiming the body?

SUGARMAN

Uh uh, that'd mean funeral

expenses.

BERGER

Man could you help me?

KLUTE

Yeah, what?

BERGER

You know, help me out. That's my

baby there, dead. I got to get up.

BERGER (CONT'D)

Man you don't know what that does

to me, my baby dead --

KLUTE

-- You've got to get up.

BERGER

Yeah.

TRASK

That's how the other one died, you

know. In the water.

KLUTE

(nods)

I looked it up.

TRASK

Well?

KLUTE

Yeah.

BREE

Well hello -- come on in.

KLUTE

I thought you ought to know, Arlyn

Page is dead.

BREE

How?

KLUTE

The same as Jane McKenna.

BREE

(she betrays no reaction)

Thanks for the jolly news. I

thought maybe you'd left town by

now. You kind of just disappeared.

But you boys from Tuscarora have a

habit of disappearing, don't you?

KLUTE

The next few weeks I would like to

know where you are all the time.

BREE

(harshly)

Why?

KLUTE

Just let me know when you are going

out and where --

BREE

What if i go out on tricks - you

wanna come along? You could sit and

read the National Geographic.

KLUTE

How can you do it to yourself?

BREE

(coolly)

I don't get you.

KLUTE

Ligourin: How could you do it?

BREE

I told you before, you wouldn't

understand.

KLUTE

You're right, I don't understand.

Explain it to me.

(pause)

You were scared. Arlyn Page, that

scared you. Well it should; that's

death.

So what did you do, you ran

straight for it, death. Ligourin

kills women.

BREE

No.

KLUTE

No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He

uses women; he lets them kill

themselves. Is that how you want

it?

BREE

Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on

junk!

KLUTE

No, you can find some other way.

(beat)

Explain it to me. Bree, show me any

sense to --

BREE

(screams, incoherently)

You get the Christ out! You dumb

stupid bastard, you don't know

anything, you square, you get out!

I don't have to show you anything;

you get out!

BREE

If I asked you something, would you

not laugh? -- asked you to look at

something?

BREE (CONT'D)

(apologetic)

I thought it was maybe changing

shape or something.

BREE (CONT'D)

Look -- I hate everybody; and I'm

sorry for everybody; and I'm scared

all the time.

BREE (CONT'D)

Look, I don't know either. It's

like the only thing I know how to

do -- I feel safe.

KLUTE

It's been a full day.

BREE

Please.

KLUTE

We did this before.

BREE

No.

(then)

Well all right. But you want to and

I want you to and we both know it

and all right.

KLUTE

(evenly, slowly)

I don't like getting splashed.

BREE

OK ----- OK

KLUTE

--- Bree ---

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

DISSOLVE:

KLUTE

Go back to sleep.

BREE

I'm still scared.

(beat)

I mean different but still.

(frowns)

Look, I made it very clear from the

start, you're a yokel, you don't

excite me, you don't even interest

me, and so I only have one question

which is what the hell are you

doing in my bed?

KLUTE

My bed.

BREE

Oh!

BREE (CONT'D)

I am scared. The things I do. The

things I could do to you.

KLUTE

Mm.

BREE

No, not just 'mm'. You don't know

what I --

BREE (CONT'D)

Oh boy, say, you think you're

pretty good.

KLUTE

Yup.

BREE

Oh --

BREE

The son of a bitch seduced me!

BREE (CONT'D)

I know: it's ridiculous. But it's

tearing me up and I don't know why.

And look, all right, I came here

didn't I? And if I have to, I'll

keep coming here, the works, and

talk about my mummy and my daddy

and I'll even pay for it, but will

you kindly for God's sakes say

something?

SPANGLER

(smiles)

I'd just be guessing.

BREE

Guess!

SPANGLER

Maybe this wasn't just a trick.

Maybe you're in danger of real

love, real involve --

BREE

(primly, distintly)

I do not love him.

SPANGLER

(undeterred, suggests)

You've spent your life avoiding

this. You'll try hard to deny it;

you're quite likely to destroy it.

WE CUT TO:

CUSTODIAN

Four -- five -- what number'd I

say?

KLUTE

Four ninety-seven, Jane McKenna

CUSTODIAN

-- And I keep the authorization,

please.

KLUTE

I thought there'd be more.

BREE (V.O.)

All right. Loneliness.

(space)

Well -- separated. From other

people. Forgotten.

(space)

Well, as if I can be here, I can go

through the motions, right? But the

truth is, I don't belong.

SPANGLER (V.O.)

(prompts mildly)

Don't belong?

BREE (V.O.)

(snappishly)

Do you always have to repeat?

SPANGLER (V.O.)

Sorry.

(then)

BREE (V.O.)

Well it's more than loneliness.

Hate. People hating me -- and

watching me and following and

waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm

all screwed up.

SPANGLER (V.O.)

You think people hate you.

BREE (V.O.)

The truth is I hate them: they must

hate me. All right, the money.

(pause)

All right, not the money. A kind of

put-on.

It gets things back together.

(pause)

Well let's say I'd go to one of

these cattle-calls, a tryout. I

mean before -- before I got this

job -- and they'd always say thank

you very much and i'd feel, you

know, brought down. They didn't

want me.

SPANGLER (V.O.)

Didn't want you.

BREE (V.O.)

(snaps)

I said that.

(resumes)

Well, so you have a choice. You can

either feel lonely -- you know, the

hate -- or --

(then more rapidly,

plunging)

So you take a call and go to a

hotel room and there's some John

you've never seen before, but he

wants you. He must, he's paying for

it.

(beat)

And usually they're nervous and

that's all right, too, because

you're not; you know this thing.

And then for a while, boy, they

really pay attention, you're all

there is.

(beat)

And it's not real and you don't

have to even like them -- you can

even hate them, it's all right, it

safe -- you know?

TRASK'S VOICE

(skipping, summarizing)

All right, there's Tom Grunemann,

you're right, different margins,

different spacing absolutely,

sloppy, right.

KLUTE'S VOICE

Mm.

TRASK'S VOICE

All right, try this next guy.

TRASK

Think this is our guy?

KLUTE

I don't know. It looks familiar to

me.

TRASK

Thought it might. It's off an

arrest report you typed two years

ago. Man you wanted samples of

everybody.

TRASK (CONT'D)

Now the next cat. Mm?

TRASK'S VOICE

Same margins top and sides. He does

best with his middle fingers; you

get fainter registration from

outside keys like Q, A, L, P and

like that. Next thing look around

apostrophes, how he hits the space

bar before --

KLUTE

But what reason could he have? What

possible reason?

TRASK

Unless he was involved with

Grunemann's disappearance.

KLUTE

I knew Tom never wrote that letter.

TRASK

What else do you know?

KLUTE

I never could believe that Tom was

a split personality. I never

believed he was a Dumper; and I

don't believe he disappeared of his

own volition; and I don't believe

he's alive.

TRASK

We have some very tentative

circumstantial evidence of freeky

behavior, but there's no evidence

of murder - there's not even a

body.

KLUTE

I don't believe Tom's alive.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

But why? Why?

KLUTE

Yes, Mr. Cable's office, please.

CABLE'S VOICE

(through telephone)

John, how are you?

KLUTE

I'll be sending you on a report

tonight.

CABLE'S VOICE

It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora -

I don't envy you that humidity in

the city.

KLUTE

It's not so bad.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Would you like to know what's in

it? The report.

CABLE'S VOICE

(obligingly)

What's in it?

KLUTE

I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've

been a lot of places - I've asked a

lot of people. I've found no proof

he's around. I've found no proof he

was ever around.

CABLE VOICE

How do you go from that to the idea

Tom's dead? Suicide you're

suggesting? He killed himself?

KLUTE

(plodding, unemphatic)

He could've been murdered.

CABLE'S VOICE

I'm sure the FBI and the Police

explored that possibility.

KLUTE

No. They never did, really. But

that's what I'm going to recommend.

The next step. Unless something --

CABLE'S VOICE

Have you discussed this with them?

KLUTE

It's in the report.

CABLE'S VOICE

Do they have the report? Have you

discussed it with them?

KLUTE

I wanted to give it to you first.

CABLE'S VOICE

All right. All right --

(then)

John, just sit tight will you? I'll

read your report, I'll discuss it

with the others. I'll be back next

Thursday, we'll talk the whole

thing over then. Nothing til

Thursday, all right?

KLUTE

All right.

CABLE'S VOICE

Thank you. Goodbye, John.

KLUTE

Goodbye, Pete.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

He was always at their house on

holidays. Tom and Holly always had

him, over on holidays. Tom felt

sorry for him - his whole life was

work. Tom felt sorry for him.

BREE

I saw Mr. Faber.

(beat)

You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?

KLUTE

(controlledly)

Yeah.

BREE

Is that all you have to say?

KLUTE

What am I supposed to say?

BREE

Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh -

go there any more.

(pause)

I know it's tough to understand,

but it wasn't easy. You see, he was

nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just

him. I got something out of it too

I guess. Anyway, I told him I

wouldn't go there anymore.

KLUTE

Well, here's your gold star.

BREE

Spangler says we have a

relationship.

KLUTE

What?

BREE

You and I -- a relationship.

KLUTE

I was wondering what that was.

BREE

(beat)

Hell there's nothing so mysterious

about the square life.

BREE

Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.

KLUTE

Don't touch anything.

BREE

You suppose he's a married fella?

BREE

He got in my clothing!

BREE (CONT'D)

Oh. Oh.

BREE (CONT'D)

Oh look what he did in them.

KLUTE

Drop it.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Stay out of there.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Listen to me: It's all right. I've

been expecting something.

BREE

(full out, vengefully)

My God, I thought it was over. And

here I am, daddy, right back at the

start.

KLUTE

Bree --

BREE

Right back at the start, right?

KLUTE

Go down in my room.

BREE

You said it was over, right? You

said not to worry any more, all

over, right?

KLUTE

Go down in my room and wait.

ROSS

(to Klute)

But if Cable killed Grunemann why

would he get you hired to look for

Grunemann?

KLUTE

Because he knew I couldn't leave

the case alone. And this way at

least he'd keep track of it. And

me.

ROSS

What about Grunemann's letters to

the girl, everything like that?

TRASK

Cable's letters, Cable's phone

calls. Cable's everything else.

He's been a Dumper a long time. He

just passed off his own peculiar

habits on the other man -- it kept

things goin'.

ROSS

OK, pretend I believe you. Tell me

how you get an indictment.

TRASK

Can't. Yet. Oh we got everythin'

else: first rate evidence Cable

typed those dumper letters to Bree

Daniel. And Jane McKenna: Klute

found a couple in her personal

remains. We got dates of Cable's

trips here coincidin' with phone

calls to Bree Daniel, also the

dates of death of McKenna and Page.

We got some hints of his personal

history. His father, unsuccessful

salesman, committed suicide when he

was 13. His mother pinned all her

hopes on her son. He won a national

science youth award at the age of

eight. They had no money, but she

hired special tutors for him in the

summer time. She saw a good thing.

He graduated from high school at 14

-- college at 16 -- no friends --

The kids in his class thought of

him as a freak. He got his Ph.D. at

18 -- married at age 21 to his then

employer's daughter. The marriage

lasted 4 weeks. Her father had it

annulled. She says he was impotent.

World War II he got in bad trouble

about a German girl, no details. We

think we know why he killed

Grunemann -- he found out Cable was

a dumper; Cable couldn't take that.

We think we know why he killed

McKenna -- she wanted to blackmail

him for it. All fine. But we got no

body, no direct witnesses, we can't

go any-damn-where.

KLUTE

That's the reason i told him we had

no evidence Tom was still alive. We

wanted to shake him into another

phone call or another letter. It

didn't work out just that way.

TRASK

Gov, want to leave me that one. How

come he got to play with this one,

anyway.

KLUTE

I left them here. I was doing some

work here.

TRASK

It's damn lucky you didn't have the

dossier on Cable here.

KLUTE

Nobody's seen that.

TRASK

If we get anything from the lab,

we'll have it by noon. And just

think -- all he really had to do

was write us a letter.

ROSS

Sounds to me you better shake him

again. Put him in a spot he has to

do something more -- but this time

give him a time and a place to do

it.

KLUTE

He called this morning from

Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at

3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's

on his way to Chicago.

TRASK

He sure chalks up a lot of flight

time.

BREE

Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?

KLUTE

Those were police laboratory

people, they've been over the

apartment.

BREE

(mock delight)

Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my

fingerprints.

(then)

Can I go in? I need some stuff.

KLUTE

Where'd you spend last night?

BREE

With Trina.

KLUTE

I called Trina.

BREE

Maybe I wasn't there when you

called.

KLUTE

Bree, what's actually happened? It

wasn't that bad.

BREE

(cuts in harshly)

How do you know how bad it was?

KLUTE

Why couldn't you stay here with me?

BREE

Because I didn't want to be

touched! I didn't think you'd get

that!

KLUTE

Trask wants to talk with you.

BREE

Hey -- look officer -- I can

explain everything. It was just --

you know, everything all of a --

KLUTE

Trask wants to talk with you.

TRASK

Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find

another place till we get things

cleaned up.

BREE

(brightly)

Oh well that shouldn't take you

more than another, oh, two and a

half or three years, should it?

TRASK

A few more days. We know who did

this.

BREE

So do I.

TRASK

No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The

man that killed him -- also prob'ly

Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.

BREE

(manages)

Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He

said they commited suicide.

TRASK

Now there's a picture I'd like you

to --

BREE

You said someone killed them, you

said you know who, you said that.

TRASK

Well we're pretty --

BREE

Why isn't he locked up?

TRASK

We don't want to just lock him up;

we want a conviction, we wanted him

to do something more.

BREE

Is that why Klute didn't tell me?

TRASK

I guess he figured it was better.

BREE

What was better? I made better

bait?

TRASK

No, that's not --

BREE

Is that what he set me up for?

Everything he's told me from the

beginning? -- don't worry, don't --

TRASK

(coldly)

From the beginning I don't know why

the hell he's messin with you. If

he was me he'd know better. If he

was even a city boy he'd know

better. You're a whore Miss Daniel,

that's the truth of it, right? Now

somethin I'd like you to look at.

BREE

I don't have to look at anything. I

don't have --

TRASK

Here please.

BREE

Oh no.

TRASK

Like for you to look for the man.

BREE

Grunemann? I've looked at him a --

TRASK

No. Not Grunemann. The Dumper. Just

look around -- I said look for the

Dumper.

BREE

Oh! --

CABLE

Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm

pressed for time.

KLUTE

Well there's a couple --

CABLE

I read your report. I had to go

along with it -- the idea of this

being a wild goose chase, Tom being

nowhere around --

KLUTE

Well as a matter of --

CABLE

I've been up country, you know my

summer place, my camp. I don't even

have a telephone there. This

morning they sent a messenger out,

that you'd been trying to call me.

KLUTE

Yeah.

CABLE

I'm on my way to Chicago. Very

important meeting tonight. Well --

any new developments?

KLUTE

Yeah, two things Pete, that --

CABLE

You said Trask was arranging

laboratory work. Police laboratory.

Anything from that?

KLUTE

Yeah. It wasn't Tom.

CABLE

I'm sorry. I don't understand.

KLUTE

It wasn't Tom that broke in the

room.

CABLE

It has to be Tom. You said he

ripped up his own pictures, he --

KLUTE

Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind

of souvenir, I told you, in her

clothing. Semen. The laboratory got

a blood group reading from that.

The man was blood type 0; Tom was

an AB.

CABLE

(slowly)

Some mistake perhaps that --

KLUTE

No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't

prove who it was -- but proves it

wasn't Tom.

CABLE

You must be discouraged.

KLUTE

(prosaically)

Not too bad. This brings back that

Dumper in the picture.

CABLE

That who?

KLUTE

Dumper, the man Bree Daniel

mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and

Jane McKenna knew.

CABLE

You said he was no possible

connection with Tom. The Page girl

told you that, not Tom.

KLUTE

Someone's been doing all these

things.

CABLE

You were hired to look for Tom, not

someone.

KLUTE

Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane

McKenna's black book.

CABLE

What?

KLUTE

Call-girls generally keep a book,

you know, a list of their clients.

Sometimes, if a girl retires,

she'll even sell it worth good

money. Jane McKenna had a black

book; when she died it was stolen.

I've been after it a long time.

CABLE

You were hired to look for Tom.

KLUTE

I'm meeting a man tomorrow night.

He wants to meet me on East-River

Drive -- he wants five hundred

dollars for the book. Can you get

that for me Pete?

CABLE

I can't follow you.

KLUTE

Will the Company put up five

hundred dollars to get Jane

McKenna's list of clients?

CABLE

No. It's ridiculous. This has

nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.

KLUTE

(shrugs, stolidly)

It probably has the Dumper's name.

It might give us some kind of new

lead.

(beat)

I want a look at it anyhow.

CABLE

Klute, the Company's interest is

Tom Grunemann. Solely and

exclusively. You say you can't find

Tom; all right, I'll see that

you're paid off; the case is

closed.

KLUTE

All right, but I'm going to see

that list.

CABLE

Why would they deal with you? You

don't know these people.

KLUTE

No, but Bree does. She's

negotiating for me. Bree Daniel.

CABLE

I can talk it over; possibly I can

get the money. When are you meeting

the man?

KLUTE

Tomorrow evening, nine. East River

Drive and 73rd Street.

CABLE

Suppose I meet you there a half

hour before.

KLUTE

Just send me a money order.

CABLE

No, I'd -- like to be in on it.

KLUTE

Well --

CABLE

Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.

KLUTE

Bree?

KLUTE

I'm always getting surprises.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

I don't want you to do this.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Please. I said I don't want you to

do this.

BREE

(tight, small)

Trask said I should move. Let's not

make a thing of it.

BREE (CONT'D)

Look, too much is going on here.

I'm moving in with another girl,

that's all. Just for a while.

FRANK

(helpfully)

That's right. This other girl's got

a very big apartment, big, plenty

of room.

(then)

Look, it's not necessarily how it

looks, right? It's --

KLUTE

No. Please. Not with this son of a

bitch.

FRANK

Klute, let's handle it like

grownups? I mean we're all grown up

now, right?

(ventures forward)

-- we all respect each other, you

know what I mean? -- I respect you,

Bree respects you -- you could say,

it just didn't work out between you

and she. But you got to respect her

too -- you know, her best

interests, best for her --

BREE

No!

FRANK

Hey, I'm gonna get you dropped.

KLUTE

(indistinctly)

Please --

BREE

-- until he gets back.

(beat)

Yes I heard you, I understand that.

I said I'm going to come over, I'll

wait until he gets back.

KLUTE

Hello?

(listens, then soberly - )

Trask, I don't get that.

KLUTE

Who told you, his secretary?

(listens)

Has someone checked his hotel? He

always stays at the --

(then)

I'll look around, I'll call you

back.

KLUTE

Bree --

LELA (O.S.)

Mrs. Daniel --

LELA

-- I have to close up now. Leave

your name and number with his

message service, Mrs. Daniel, and

why don't you just go home and wait

until he --

BREE

No.

LELA

Well I have to close up now.

BREE

Look -- could I use your phone?

LELA

Yes indeed.

BREE

Look. I almost killed my -- I

almost killed someone.

LELA

(the same tone,

completely)

Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler

will want to talk with you; excuse

me.

BREE (O.S.)

Is Mr. Faber there?

(beat)

Mr. Faber Senior.

FABER

Yes?

(then, glancing about)

Bree?

BREE

(haltingly)

-- I'm -- I just have to talk to

someone. I'm just a little way

across town --

FABER

Yes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half

an hour, sure, yes.

KLUTE

Trina, will you call me if you hear

from, her? Will you check other

people she might call? Yeah, if it

wasn't trouble I wouldn't ask vou.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Yeah?

(then)

Nothing yet, Trask; I'm going down

the list. I've tried Spangler's

office and Spangler's home; I just

get his message service. I'll keep--

(interrupted -- listens --

then -- grimly)

I may have steered Cable that way.

I told him Bree was dealing for me,

for Jane McKenna's book. Have you

found any --

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Yeah.

FOREMAN

Lady, it's closing up there.

BREE

What?

FOREMAN

We're closing up, quitting time,

Fabers.

BREE

(unsurely)

I have an appointment with Mr.

Faber.

FOREMAN

Oh, yeah.

BREE

I have an appointment with Mr.

Faber.

RECEPTIONIST

In there.

(turns, bawls)

Mr. Faber --

RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) (O.S.)

(CONT'D)

Mr. Faber --

NATHAN

Yes?

BREE

I'm sorry -- Mr. Faber Senior.

NATHAN

(calmly)

My father went home about fifteen

minutes ago; he wasn't feeling too

good.

NATHAN (CONT'D)

Can I help you?

BREE

It wasn't important.

BREE

Did Mr. Faber leave a message for

me or anything? Mr. Faber Senior?

Bree Daniel.

RECEPTIONIST

Oh, I thought that was for

tomorrow.

BREE

Bree Daniel. Has he called in yet?

Well if he does, I'm at --

(reads phone)

-- two seven eight, three one

hundred, and I guess I can wait

here five minutes; then I'll try

from somewhere else.

(impatiently)

Just tell him Bree Daniel; he knows

who.

BREE (CONT'D)

Mr. Faber, I just wanted to leave

this for your father, and I

wondered if you'd --

BREE (CONT'D)

Someone --

KLUTE

Did she leave a number?

(beat)

This is a police call; don't make

me take time to prove it. Did she

leave a number? What is the number?

(beat)

What is the number? --

CABLE

Can't we talk together reasonably,

just -- ordinarily?

(beat)

I know you're expecting some kind

of -- extravagant behavior, but

believe me -- do you believe me? --

BREE

Yes -- all right --

CABLE

-- We can talk --

BREE

-- Yes.

CABLE

All right, then, an ordinary

matter. I'm a quite well off man, I

have a -- position to respect. I

would feel personally uncomfortable

to be connected with a -- certain

kind of woman, I'm sure you

understand. Do you? Well I'd like

to buy Jane McKenna's book.

CABLE (CONT'D)

Her black book, Jane McKenna's, her

list of -- of persons. I was told

you're negotiating for it on behalf

of --

CABLE (CONT'D)

That was what Klute told me -- you

were negotiating for him to buy

that list. And I'm in a position to

pay a good deal more for it than he

can. Do you understand? I'd like

you to acquire it on my --

(beat)

Miss Daniel, do you not understand?

(beat)

Miss Daniel, I can't tell whether

you understand me.

(beat - still reasonably)

Is this something Klute just

invented? Is this a trap for me,

Miss Daniel; does Klute know about

me?

CABLE (CONT'D)

You have no idea what I'm talking

about.

BREE

Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I

could make a phone call.

CABLE

No, you're frightened, you're

pretending. Well -- Klute knows

about me then. Does everybody know,

can you tell me?

BREE

Yes.

CABLE

Then it doesn't matter what I do

any more, does it?

CABLE (CONT'D)

You people know nothing about pain.

CABLE

I've got no idea what I shall do.

CABLE (CONT'D)

I'm not going to hurt you,

absolutely, I'm not.

BREE

Will you let me go then?

CABLE

It puzzles me so badly. I've done

terrible things but I can't

consider myself a terrible man.

I've killed three people and I'd

still want to say it was accident,

do you see?

BREE

(tries again, slowly)

If you'll let me go I could tell

them what --

CABLE

(unhearing, resumes)

Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we

were here on business together, he

discovered me with Jane McKenna.

Then I suppose it was the -- the

contempt I saw in his face and the

certainty that sooner or later he'd

use it against me. Within the

Company. I endured that as long as

I could, do you see?

BREE

I'm sorry, I'm just frightened.

Yes.

CABLE

Excuse me Miss Daniel?

BREE

I said yes, I see.

CABLE

(doubtingly)

Oh no, I don't think --

BREE

Tell me. I'll listen.

(pause)

I just want you to tell me.

CABLE

You're willing to listen? You want

me just to keep talking?

CABLE (CONT'D)

That's what you do, isn't it; you

make a man feel accepted.

That's what you all do. Your stock

in trade a man's weakness.

CABLE (CONT'D)

Why don't you ask for mercy? My

God, what mercy has anyone given

me?

CABLE

You're a person of no value, you

have no value --

CABLE (CONT'D)

-- Is that contempt? Is it?

(then)

No, I'm the one who feels contempt.

KLUTE

Come on.

(pause)

Come on.

BREE

Hi.

KLUTE

I got a call from Ross this

morning. Cable owned a plot of

woodland -- he'd go there on

weekends. They found Tom

Grunemann's body buried there.

They've notified his wife.

BREE

Oh.

(pause; then sharply --)

Well it wasn't us city people that

did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked

country boy.

KLUTE

Mm.

BREE

You're going back?

KLUTE

Mm.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Wait.

BREE

Well suppose I hadn't come

downstairs. Would you just have

folded up and sneaked away?

KLUTE

(slowly)

No. I was going to come up. I

wanted to ask you to marry me.

(pause)

BREE

You wanted to, or you are?

KLUTE

I am.

BREE

You could at least look at me!

BREE (CONT'D)

Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but --

don't you think we better be

realistic?

KLUTE

About what?

BREE

Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of

clever and very well intentioned,

and dear God I'd tear your heart

out!

KLUTE

I don't think so.

BREE

How can you not think so? You know

the things I can do.

KLUTE

(unclearly)

They don't scare me any more.

BREE

What?

KLUTE

Doesn't scare me. I think we could

handle it.

BREE

Please, I'm a city person. I'm sure

it's just as good as here but I'm a

city person, that's all, I am!

(pause)

Hell I know what it's like. I was

in Jersey once: the frogs go bra-a

p all night!

(pause)

What'im I supposed to do? Mend your

socks and sing in the church choir?

(pause, choking) )

Do you not believe I love you? I'm

honestly, honestly just --

BREE (CONT'D)

Look, why should it be yes or no?

Can't we keep it going and see? I

mean we can keep in touch and visit

each other and see. People do that,

that's realistic.

KLUTE

OK.

BREE

(bitterly)

You don't believe that either, do

you? Why can't you see my side?

KLUTE

Can you use these?

BREE

Can I carry something for you, to

the car?

(he shakes his head)

Will you kiss me?

KLUTE

No. I'm sore.

KLUTE (CONT'D)

Well --

BREE

Hey.

BREE

Oh heck --

(pause)

Oh heck --

BREE (CONT'D)

I haven't decided yet!

(beat)

I haven't decided yet!

(beat)

I haven't decided yet! --

THE END
