COREY

What time is it?

SAM

Early...

2.

COREY

Shit...

SAM

Turn it off.

COREY

(poking her head out the

WINDOW)

What?

SAM

Turn off the car.

SAM (CONT'D)

Doesn't look too good...

COREY

How do you know?

3.

SAM

It smells funny.

SAM (CONT'D)

Thanks for stopping. Our car's

messed up.

CHRIS

What happened?

COREY

My check engine light came on, then

it just started smoking, and

ticking and shit.

CHRIS

(shaking it off)

Blew your water pump. Can't drive

it.

COREY

Fuck me...

CHRIS

El Reno's just a couple miles up

ahead. Can call for a tow there.

C'mon, I'll give you a lift.

4.

CHRIS

He waves to everybody... Just kinda

walks up and down.

COREY

Resident nutcase?

CHRIS

People call him Vietnam Tom.

SAM

He was in the war?

CHRIS

He thinks he was... kind of a joke,

ya know?

5.

RUTH

Can I get out?

DUSTY

Yeah... it's the water pump.

COREY

So what do we do?

DUSTY

I can order you up a new one.

Probably be a couple days.

COREY

Great. This the only show in town?

DUSTY

Cheapest and the best. But you want

me to call the tow guy back here,

no problem. Probably charge you

another hundred bucks, but he'll

get ya wherever you wanna go.

COREY

Just go ahead and fix it.

PHIL

What can I do for you?

COREY

We need a room.

6.

SAM

How much is it?

PHIL

$39 a night. How many you stayin'?

COREY

Just a couple, we hope.

PHIL

Well... welcome to El Reno.

RUTH

You get checked into the motel

alright?

COREY

Yep.

RANDY

My name's Randy. This is Mike and

Jeff. Guess you already know Ruth.

COREY

Corey.

SAM

I'm Samantha.

COREY

One of you guys mind pickin' us up

a bottle of something?

RANDY

I think I can manage that. What do

you want?

7.

COREY

I don't know. Vodka, whiskey,

whatever.

RANDY

Be right back...

RUTH

From Virginia, huh?

COREY

Yep.

RUTH

I saw your plates...

RUTH (CONT'D)

Where to?

COREY

What?

RUTH

Your obviously just passin' through

here.

SAM

We're on the way to Vegas.

RUTH

Well... you need anything besides

booze, you just lemme know.

COREY

Thanks a lot, man.

8.

RANDY

No problem. You guys wanna come

back to my place for bit? Bring

your bottle, we got some weed...

SAM

I'm really tired.

COREY

Yeah, I think we'll just head back.

Been a long day, ya know?

RANDY

That's cool.

9.

SAM

The sky's so beautiful here...

10.

SAM (CONT'D)

But we can't stay.

DISTORTED VOICE (V.O.)

15 days... 18 hours... 45

minutes... 6 seconds. That is when

the world will end.

11.

OFFICER O'DELL

`Fraid you can't sleep here, miss.

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

Got anyplace to be?

SAM

The motel.

DISPATCH (V.O.)

We got some kinda situation at

Frank Haley's farm...

OFFICER O'DELL

Copy that. I'm here now...

FRANK

Un-fuckin'-believable...

12.

FIREMAN #1

It's still warm.

FRANK

You know how much it's gonna cost

me to replace this goddamn

windmill?

OFFICER O'DELL

Sell this thing off to some

meteorologist nerd club, I bet you

could do okay.

FRANK

Ya think?

OFFICER O'DELL

What's all that stuff, Frank?

FRANK

That whack job Tom's been squattin'

up there the last couple a' months.

Thinks he's the goddamn town

watchman...

(BEAT)

You think he got blown up?

PHIL

I saw him out in front of the motel

early this morning, alive and well.

FRANK

(SARCASTIC)

Oh, well, thank heavens...

13.

CHRIS

Hey...

SAM

Hey.

CHRIS

So you guys stayed here last night?

COREY

One of us did.

CHRIS

What's up with your car?

COREY

It's gonna take a couple days.

CHRIS

For a water pump?

CHRIS (CONT'D)

None of my business, but...

SAM

What?

CHRIS

I was just gonna say, if you

wanted, I could give you a ride

back.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

You too. I mean, I could give you

both a ride.

14.

COREY

To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you have

any clue how far that is?

CHRIS

(SHEEPISH)

I got some time...

COREY

We're not goin' back. Even El

Reno's better than there.

TRUDY (O.S.)

Isn't that just awful?

TRUDY (CONT'D)

His poor mother...

COREY

How much money do we have left?

15.

SAM

Not a whole lot.

COREY

I can't believe your fucking

parents wouldn't give you anything.

SAM

They totally flipped out that I was

even going. They weren't about to

give me money for the big trip.

COREY

We should've waited till the end of

the month when my mom gets her

check.

SAM

She wouldn't have given you

anything.

COREY

I know where she keeps her cash.

What's she gonna do, send her

boyfriend after me?

COREY (CONT'D)

Doesn't matter. As soon as we get

to Vegas, we'll be set. My cousin

said sometimes she makes two grand

in a week.

SAM

Jesus.

AGATHA

Here you go. Where'd you two say

you were from again?

SAM

Virginia.

AGATHA

You hear that, Ted?

16.

TED

What?

AGATHA

These girls are from Virginia.

TED

I'll be damned. I'm from Reedville,

if you know where abouts that is...

TED (CONT'D)

Well, have yourself some ice cream

when you're done, on the house.

COREY                               SAM

AGATHA

Anything else you need, give a

holler.

JEREMY

Just a coffee, please.

COREY

Can we help you?

JEREMY

No, no... it's just that I

recognize you. I saw you by the

motel. Pretty amazing, huh?

COREY

I guess.

JEREMY

I just made a deal with Frank Haley

to buy it for seven-hundred fifty

dollars.

17.

COREY

Whoop-dee-doo. What the hell are

you gonna do with a friggin'

meteor?

JEREMY

Meteorite, actually...

JEREMY (CONT'D)

I'm gonna study it. I'm a grad

student at Redlands... we've

actually got a pretty cool geology

lab there.

JEREMY (CONT'D)

I've gotta do some tests, but if I

had to guess, I'd say it's a

siderite. They're composed

primarily of iron and nickel.

COREY

Have fun.

JEREMY

My name's Jeremy.

COREY

That's nice.

COREY

What's his problem?

18.

SAM

Just keep walking.

COREY

Freak...

RANDY

Hey, what's up?

COREY

Not much... just getting stared

down by creepy priest boy back

there.

JEFF

Father Homeijer?

MIKE

Don't worry, you're a little old

for his taste.

JEFF

Yeah, he's a fuckin' perv.

COREY

(to Randy)

You got an extra cigarette?

RANDY

I'm throwin' a big party at my

house tonight, you guys should come

by. No excuses this time...

19.

RANDY (CONT'D)

You're gonna be stuck in El Reno,

you might as well have some fun,

right?

COREY

You guys gotta come visit the club

when we get all set up. We'll give

you the VIP treatment, man...

MIKE

Sounds good to me.

COREY

Give us a little time, me and

Sam'll be runnin' that place, no

doubt... right?

SAM

Yeah. Definitely.

RUTH

Fuck.

RANDY

What?

RUTH

That pig, O'Dell.

20.

RANDY

Don't worry about Ryan. He might be

a cop, but he still likes to party.

RUTH

I think that asshole knows I deal.

You know how fucked that is?

RANDY

From what I hear he's got a little

somethin' goin' on the side

himself.

RUTH

Fucking pig's a pig.

MIKE                               JEFF

SAM

What the hell...

RANDY

We might as well all go in now,

we're already wet.

RUTH

Good idea...

21.

RANDY

You fall asleep down there?

CHRIS

Thought you could maybe use this.

CHRIS

So what's so wrong at home that you

had to take off?

22.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

I'd love to get outta here someday

too... just don't know quite where

I'd go.

SAM

I hate it there. It's like everyone

knows everything about me, but I'm

invisible at the same time. It's

like the worst of both worlds.

CHRIS

Small towns. How `bout your family?

SAM

They didn't want me to leave...

well, they did, but they wanted me

to go away to Harvard or something

like that, like my sister.

SAM (CONT'D)

Sometimes I think it would've been

easier if... I just, after my

BROTHER-

CHRIS

What?

SAM

(changing gears)

That's why I love Corey, she just

doesn't give a shit. She does what

she wants and she doesn't care what

people think.

CHRIS

You just gotta be yourself, that's

all. What is it you wanna do

exactly?

SAM

I always thought I'd be a dancer,

like in a troupe or something...

SAM (CONT'D)

That sounds kinda stupid probably.

23.

CHRIS

No...

SAM

When I was younger, my dance team

was on Star Search.

CHRIS

Really?

SAM

Yeah... but I didn't go.

CHRIS

Why not?

SAM

I didn't end up dancing in the

talent show where they got

discovered... I didn't really feel

like it at the time anyway.

CHRIS

Huh...

SAM

But that's why we're going to

Vegas. There's lots of

opportunities there.

CHRIS

(SMIRKING)

Yeah, good place for it. Gettin'

some practice on the way, too.

SAM

Is that supposed to be like some

kind of judgement or something?

CHRIS

No, I was just-

CHRIS (CONT'D)

Sam, wait... hey, come on...

24.

DRUNK GUY #1

Hurry up...

25.

26.

PHIL

You plannin' on checkin' out today?

SAM

(GROGGY)

Uh... I, I don't know yet.

PHIL

Well, it's already way past

checkout time, so you'd better

figure it out quick.

SAM

I've just gotta find Corey... and

check on the car.

27.

PHIL

You do whatever you have to, but if

you're stayin' another night I

wanna see some money up front.

TRUDY

I don't believe it... I still just

don't believe it.

FEMALE CO-WORKER

It's gonna be alright. You'll see.

TRUDY

(dabbing at her eyes with

a tissue)

Can I help you?

SAM

Is everything okay?

TRUDY

No, it's not... Mount Calvary

burned to the ground last night.

SAM

Mount Calvary?

TRUDY

Father Homeijer's church.

SAM

Oh... How did it happen?

28.

TRUDY

The police are looking into it,

but... I know it was arson.

TRUDY (CONT'D)

It's no secret to me how people in

this town feel about Father

Homeijer. The horrible accusations

that have been made against him...

But it's just a lot of nonsense. El

Reno's changed so much since I was

a kid growing up here. The young

people nowadays...

(BEAT)

No offense.

TRUDY (CONT'D)

But with all the drugs and the

crime... I just don't know what

this world's coming to anymore.

SAM

Are you able to get money wired

here from my bank back home?

TRUDY

We don't usually work with other

banks like that.

SAM

I need to check my balance and get

my money out. How do I do that?

TRUDY

You'll have to call and arrange it.

You could always use Western Union.

Where's your bank?

SAM

Virginia.

TRUDY

Oh... `cause they're gonna need to

have a signature.

29.

JEREMY

Hi there.

SAM

Hey.

JEREMY

I didn't get your name at the

diner.

SAM

I'm Sam.

JEREMY

Jeremy.

JEREMY (CONT'D)

So what are you up to?

SAM

Trying to get money... not very

successfully.

JEREMY

I've gotta pick up some cash too.

Need some supplies for the lab. I

don't think I've even slept since I

got my hands on that meteorite. You

should come by the lab with me and

check it out.

SAM

I can't...

30.

JEREMY

I could let you borrow some

money... if you need some.

SAM

I don't even know you.

JEREMY

That's okay. I trust you.

SAM

Thanks anyway.

JEREMY

You're sure you don't want to check

out the lab?

SAM

Sorry... I've gotta find Corey.

JEREMY

Maybe some other time.

MIKE

How many cheeseburgers did we get?

RUTH

Like eight.

JEFF

Wait, did we get smokes?

MIKE                            RANDY

31.

OFFICER O'DELL (O.S.)

Musta' melted from the heat.

FATHER HOMEIJER

They're made of silver-plated

steel. A simple fire couldn't do

that.

OFFICER O'DELL

What are you sayin'?

FATHER HOMEIJER

This is an extension of Satan's own

hand... I've seen it coming.

COREY

What happened to you?

32.

SAM

What happened to me...? Where the

hell've you been?

COREY

I crashed at Randy's. We just got

food. Want a burger?

SAM

My stomach's fucked up.

JEFF                             MIKE

SAM (CONT'D)

We gotta talk about what we're

gonna do.

COREY

Don't worry about it so much.

SAM

The motel guy came to the room this

morning all pissed off. We're

probably not even gonna have enough

money to pay for the car.

RANDY

Should I wait a minute?

JEFF

We gotta get some smokes...

COREY

Just go ahead. I'll catch up with

you later on.

RANDY

Alright. Later.

33.

SAM

We just gotta figure out what we're

gonna do. I don't think-

COREY

(ABRUPT)

Lemme guess, you wanna go home.

SAM

What?

COREY

You wanna run back to mommy and

daddy and say sorry so they can put

you through college. Well that's

real big of you, Sam, but I don't

have that option.

SAM

(taken aback)

What are you talking about?

COREY

I'll go home and get the shit

kicked out of me, and get my ass

grabbed by my mom's boyfriend...

COREY (CONT'D)

I knew you'd bail on me eventually,

but not this quick.

SAM

I'm not bailing on you. Would you

JUST-

34.

COREY

You can fucking sleepwalk back to

Middlesex for all I care. I'm not

driving you... you're a fucking

drag.

SAM

Fuck you, Corey.

35.

OFFICER O'DELL

You're sure you didn't see a

driver?

COREY

No...

OFFICER O'DELL

Well, you're one lucky girl to have

gotten outta the car when you did.

Front passenger side was wiped

right out. Coulda' been two dead

girls today instead of one.

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

I talked to Randy and sent him home

a little while ago. He's pretty

shook up.

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

Both of us know he'd been doin'

some drinkin' today. But we also

know he's not at fault here. That

old beater cut right in front him.

COREY

Can't you just look up the license

plates?

36.

OFFICER O'DELL

No plates on the vehicle. We're

investigating the VIN, but that

could take a little more time,

depending on the history of

ownership. We'll find him.

COREY

What about the missing boy?

OFFICER O'DELL

You really think it was him, huh?

COREY

He was on the side of the road

right before the accident.

OFFICER O'DELL

I'm no psychiatrist, but I do know

sometimes shock does funny

things...

COREY

You think I was hallucinating?

OFFICER O'DELL

We were on the scene five minutes

after the accident. I think

somebody woulda noticed a little

boy wandering around.

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

Why don't you stop in and see Dr.

Peters on your way out... right

down the hall there. She'll give

you somethin' to make you feel

better.

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

Oh, uh... is there anything you

wanted to say to Samantha's

parents?

37.

COREY

Like what?

CHRIS

Get the hell outta here.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

Should know better than to be

carrying his rifle around town like

that...

CHRIS (CONT'D)

You okay?

COREY

What're you doing here?

CHRIS

I had to put in a statement too.

Can I give you a lift?

CHRIS

I'm real sorry about Sam.

38.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

It's such a waste. Just a horrible,

freak thing.

COREY

I said some pretty shitty things to

her right before it happened.

CHRIS

I'm sure she knew you didn't mean

it.

COREY

Fragmentary Universe...

39.

BILLY MOORCROFT

You need to save me, Corey.

BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)

You need to save me... and save the

world.

COREY

Why can't anyone see you?

BILLY MOORCROFT

If you tell them about me they'll

think you're a dummy.

COREY

Why me?

BILLY MOORCROFT

I didn't pick you. Just like you

didn't pick me either.

BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)

We shouldn't even be here. Nobody

should...

40.

BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)

You don't have much time.

PHIL (O.S.)

What's goin' on out here?

COREY

Nothing... I-I don't know.

PHIL

Go back to your room and get some

sleep. You've had a tough day.

CHRIS

Hey... how ya feelin'?

COREY

Not so good.

CHRIS

Is there anything I can do?

COREY

I need some cigarettes... and maybe

some food. But I don't really have

any money right now.

CHRIS

I'm off at 3:30. Meet me out behind

the store.

41.

COREY

Thanks.

CHRIS

Shouldn't you go back home?

COREY

There's nothing for me to go home

to. Trust me.

CHRIS

What about Sam's funeral?

COREY

What's the point? She's gone,

that's it. Nothing's gonna change

that...

COREY (CONT'D)

Is there a library around here?

CHRIS

(PUZZLED)

Yeah... you need a book?

COREY

Is it walking distance?

CHRIS

I can take you.

COREY

I think I'd rather walk.

CHRIS

So you guys were real close, huh.

42.

COREY

When I moved to Virginia Sam was

like the only person I could even

stand to talk to.

CHRIS

How long had you been plannin' your

trip together?

COREY

Not too long... kind of a last

minute thing. It was good timing,

`cause I don't like to stay in one

place for too long, ya know?

CHRIS

Huh...

COREY

I was really surprised when Sam

wanted to come, actually. I just

kinda brought it up one day, and

she was down...

COREY (CONT'D)

If it wasn't for me, she'd still be

alive right now.

CHRIS

You can't think like that.

COREY

It's true, isn't it?

CHRIS

That was Sam's brother?

COREY

Yeah.

43.

CHRIS

Her parents must be going through

hell.

COREY

Sam said once she wished it landed

on her room instead of Donnie's.

CHRIS

I saw something on Sam's wrist the

other night... it looked like a

scar.

COREY

She told me it was from some

accident. Put her hand through a

window or something.

CHRIS

Did you believe her?

CHRIS (CONT'D)

God...

CHRIS (CONT'D)

I don't understand why we're

lookin' at this stuff.

COREY

They still never found a driver to

that car that hit Randy... I was

standing right there. I didn't see

anyone.

44.

CHRIS

I was pretty close too, but

everything was all crazy. Whoever

it was must've jumped out and took

off.

COREY

I found this book in Sam's backpack

last night. There's a chapter where

it talks about stuff like this

happening. Like a guy being killed

by an arrow that nobody shot, and a

swordsmith getting killed by a

sword he hadn't made yet.

Unexplainable things, but it says

there's a reason why they happen.

CHRIS

A book...? I don't get what your

talkin' about. What was the reason?

COREY

It didn't say.

COREY (CONT'D)

Last night, and right before the

accident, I saw...

CHRIS

What?

COREY

Nothing.

COREY (CONT'D)

You already think I'm a freak show.

45.

RUTH (O.S.)

Darielle!

RUTH (CONT'D)

Come to check on your car?

COREY

Yeah...

RUTH

Randy's been a wreck since the

accident.

CHRIS

He should be. He was driving around

shit-faced and somebody got killed.

RUTH

You can just fuck off...

RUTH (CONT'D)

Prima donna motherfucker think your

shit don't stink?

COREY

She's right...

COREY (CONT'D)

I mean, there's nothing Randy

could've done.

46.

RUTH

I'll get my dad.

DUSTY

Got some bad news for you...

DUSTY (CONT'D)

Your engine seized up when your

water pump blew.

COREY

I need a new engine now?

DUSTY

I can get one in there for you.

Cost you about fifteen hundred.

COREY

I don't have anywhere near that

much money.

CHRIS

That's probably as much as the

car's worth.

DUSTY

I understand. But, I already

ordered the water pump, and I'll

have to get paid for my time. That

comes to about three-hundred total.

COREY

I don't have that much either.

DUSTY

You think I do this for charity?

47.

CHRIS

You didn't do anything. What's she

want a water pump for if she

doesn't have an engine?

DUSTY

I see how it is... couple a' punks.

You don't plan to pay what you owe,

you can get the hell off my

property right now.

COREY

(under her breath)

Asshole.

CHRIS

Let's go...

FATHER HOMEIJER

Good afternoon.

TRUDY

We're taking collections to help

rebuild Mount Calvary after the

tragic fire.

FATHER HOMEIJER

Any small amount you could manage

would really help.

CHRIS

Sorry.

FATHER HOMEIJER

God bless you.

48.

CHRIS

Everybody wants somethin'...

COREY

What about you?

CHRIS

What do you mean?

COREY

You wouldn't give me stuff and

drive me around if you didn't want

something in return.

CHRIS

Why not?

COREY

`Cause that's just not how it

works.

CHRIS

Maybe you're wrong about that.

COREY

See ya.

RANDY

Do you hate me?

COREY

Huh?

49.

RANDY

You think it's my fault she's dead.

COREY

No...

RANDY

You mean it?

COREY

Yeah... it wasn't your fault.

RANDY

What's that?

COREY

Oh, it's just... something of

Sam's.

RANDY

You wanna get outta here for a

while? I got my dad's car.

RANDY

I've been comin' up here since I

was a kid. Good place when you

wanna just get away from

everything.

COREY

Is Ruth your girlfriend?

50.

RANDY

Naw, we're just friends. She's

pretty weird sometimes. Too like...

intense, or something.

COREY

Seems like you guys are pretty

close.

RANDY

Yeah... don't worry about Ruth.

COREY

Do you ever have a hard time

telling what's real and what's not

real?

RANDY

Sometimes... sometimes something

can feel really real, but it's just

your mind playing tricks on you.

COREY

I've got so much shit in my head

right now... I've never felt so

outta control. I think I'm really

goin' psycho.

RANDY

I got some acid from my buddy one

time... this like flying eagle

pyramid shit. I took two hits, and

man... next thing I knew I was on

the floor, curled up in ball, and

Mike and Jeff were just standing

there lookin' down at me. I could

see this like glowing grid cutting

through my brain, and I knew when

it got all the way through I'd be

this sketched out vegetable. I

could picture my dad staring down

at me in the hospital in my

straightjacket, crying and shit...

51.

RANDY (CONT'D)

The whole time my esophagus was

like twisting and turning in my

throat and cutting off my air

supply... it was terrible.

COREY

Jesus.

RANDY

I can still slip back into it

sometimes, but I know now that my

brain is what's making it real...

and that's like a blessing and a

curse, man, `cause that means you

have to decide what's real and

what's not.

COREY

The things that feel the most real

right now are... impossible. More

like a dream.

RANDY

I know what you mean. The scariest

part is thinking you're not the

same person anymore. Something's

changed... like your identity.

COREY

What if the change is for the

better?

RANDY

That's fucked up.

COREY

I don't think I even care if I'm

crazy.

COREY (CONT'D)

What the fuck?

52.

COREY (CONT'D)

That fucking guy again...

RANDY

Let's get outta here.

COREY

This is cool.

RANDY

Thanks.

53.

BILLY MOORCROFT

Only one day left.

COREY

What am I supposed to do?

54.

BILLY MOORCROFT

You can do it.

COREY

How?

BILLY MOORCROFT

It's easy.

55.

FIREMAN #2

Lucky I heard him screamin', else

he woulda drowned down there.

RUTH

Shit!

56.

CUSTOMER

I just checked aisle three.

CHRIS

They're there. At the front, by the

Trapper Keepers.

COREY

I'm outta cigarettes.

CHRIS

D'ya hear the news?

COREY

What?

CHRIS

They found that Billy Moorcroft

kid. He was at Dusty's house...

57.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

Sick bastard had him locked up in

the basement. I can't believe we

were just over there yesterday.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

I guess he's gonna be okay-

COREY

Everything's gonna be okay.

COREY (CONT'D)

I'm not crazy. I think everything's

gonna be okay.

COREY

I already saved you.

BILLY MOORCROFT

It's not over.

58.

COREY

(CONFUSED)

Why?

CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST

(between bites of cake)

The place for Billy to be right now

is at home with his family...

BILLY'S MOTHER

Excuse me.

CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST

Oh, thank you.

CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT'D)

It'll take years for him to work

through what happened, but the best

way to open those doors is to

surround him with things that are

familiar...

59.

BILLY'S MOTHER

Are you sure you don't want some

more cake?

BILLY'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

Billy... I-

BILLY'S FATHER

Only family and close friends are

welcome here today.

COREY

I understand... I just wanted to

say that I'm sorry about everything

that happened to Billy. And I know

it doesn't seem like it, but

everything happens for a reason...

and it'll all work out in the end.

60.

RANDY

Corey...

61.

62.

COREY

What happened to you?

SAM

What happened to me...? Where the

hell've you been?

COREY

I crashed at Randy's. We just got

food. Want a burger?

SAM

My stomach's fucked up.

JEFF                               MIKE

SAM (CONT'D)

We gotta talk about what we're

gonna do.

COREY

Don't worry about it so much.

SAM

The motel guy came to the room this

MORNING-

COREY

(INTERRUPTING)

I don't give a fuck.

SAM

Excuse me?

63.

COREY

I said, I. Don't. Give. A. Fuck...

COREY (CONT'D)

I'm tired of listening to you whine

about everything.

SAM

Corey, you're still drunk. Don't be

a fuck-ass.

JEFF

Did she just call her a fuck-ass?

MIKE

What's a fuck-ass?

COREY

See ya later, Sam.

64.

OFFICER O'DELL

I just gotta ask you one more

time... you're sure you didn't see

a driver?

65.

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

Well, we'll find him, one way or

another.

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

Why don't you stop in and see Dr.

Peters on your way out... right

down the hall there. She'll give

you somethin' to make you feel

better.

CHRIS

You okay?

66.

CHRIS

I'm really sorry, Sam.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

It's horrible... but sometimes

these things can happen for a

reason. Sometimes good can come of

it... growth, ya know?

SAM

What the fuck are you talking

about?

CHRIS

All I meant was, sometimes-

SAM

I know what you meant, and it's

bullshit. When someone dies for no

reason you can't just make one up

to fill the void and make yourself

feel better. It sucks, and it fucks

everything up, but it doesn't mean

shit beyond that.

CHRIS

I'm sorry, I-

SAM

You've obviously never lost anybody

like I have, `cause if you did

you'd already know that.

SAM (CONT'D)

Thanks for the ride.

67.

SAM

Remnants...

68.

SAM

Hi, Tom. I like your new mask.

SAM (CONT'D)

Are you scared?

SAM (CONT'D)

I know you can hear me...

SAM

Perfect...

JEREMY

Sam? Are you okay? What are doing?

SAM

I'm... yeah, I'm okay.

69.

JEREMY

You shouldn't be out here like

this. C'mon, get in.

JEREMY

You do that a lot?

SAM

I think it's genetic or something.

JEREMY

That's interesting... I've never

heard of a specific genetic marker

for sleepwalking.

SAM

It's just that my brother used to

do it too.

JEREMY

He doesn't anymore?

SAM

No.

JEREMY

I think it's more common in

children. When did your brother

stop?

SAM

When he died.

70.

JEREMY

I heard about your friend...

JEREMY (CONT'D)

I wasn't gonna say anything... but

then I thought I probably should,

because if I didn't, it might be

inconsiderate.

SAM

Well... okay. Thanks.

JEREMY

So... what are you gonna do?

SAM

I don't know yet.

SAM (CONT'D)

Do you believe that everything

happens for a reason?

JEREMY

I know that for every action

there's an equal and opposite

reaction.

SAM

Yeah... I learned that in science.

JEREMY

And everything in the universe is

in constant motion, as the universe

is constantly expanding...

SAM

Yeah, but do you believe that

everything happens for a reason,

like in life?

JEREMY

You mean like destiny?

71.

JEREMY (CONT'D)

I think everyone has a purpose.

Something they're meant to do. Like

potential, but more clear-cut. For

instance, I was destined to get my

hands on the meteorite.

SAM

Really.

JEREMY

I'm making amazing discoveries

every day, practically sleeping at

the lab...

JEREMY (CONT'D)

I'm still doing some tests, but

there's a metallic substance that's

not showing up on the elemental

CHARTS-

SAM

What happened to your arm?

JEREMY

It's just a rash.

JEREMY (CONT'D)

Sam, wait. Here...

SAM

BUT-

JEREMY

I know you need it. It's no big

deal.

SAM

Thank you.

72.

YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)

Donnie!

DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)

(MOCKING)

The Last Unicorn, by Samantha

Darko!

YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)

Give it back!

DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)

There was once a unicorn named

Ariel...

YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)

Donnie! You wrinkled it.

DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)

It's not wrinkled Sam. Just, ya

know, flatten it in a book or

something...

FATHER HOMEIJER

Any small amount you could manage

would really help.

73.

FAT MAN

Piss off...

FATHER HOMEIJER

God bless you.

TRUDY

Oh... hello.

FATHER HOMEIJER

(to Sam)

God bless you.

ROSE DARKO (V.O.)

Hello?

ROSE DARKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Samantha?

EDDIE DARKO (V.O.)

(in the background)

Who is it, Rose?

ROSE DARKO (V.O.)

(CRYING)

Is that you?... if it's you, please

come home.

EDDIE DARKO (V.O.)

Rose?

74.

SAM

You wanna know what happens when

you die?

SAM (CONT'D)

I wish it was me.

SAM (CONT'D)

I really want... to die.

75.

SAM (CONT'D)

(DISAPPOINTED)

Not today.

SAM

(SURPRISED)

Hi.

CHRIS

I just stopped by to see how you

were holdin' up.

SAM

I'm okay.

CHRIS

Sorry about the other night... I

DIDN'T-

SAM

I was just upset. I shouldn't have

snapped at you like that.

CHRIS

So what are you still doin' here? I

figured you woulda hopped on a bus

by now.

SAM

I'm gonna be taking off soon, I

think. I just gotta figure some

stuff out. It's quiet here.

CHRIS

I don't know if you're doin'

anything later on, but...

76.

SAM

I was just on my way out. What were

you gonna say?

CHRIS

Nothin'.

SAM

Okay, well... I'll see you later?

CHRIS

Yeah, sure.

SAM

Bye.

CHRIS

Bye.

JEREMY

Here's my station.

SAM

That's it?

JEREMY

The rest is locked away somewhere

else... somewhere safe. Everyone's

gonna want a piece of this thing

pretty soon.

77.

JEREMY (CONT'D)

You ever seen one of these?

SAM

No.

JEREMY

It's a scanning electron

microscope. It uses electrons

instead of light to scan the image.

JEREMY (CONT'D)

At first I thought it was a

siderite, but then I saw it was

more than that. Much more. It does

have a percentage of nickel and

iron in it as I first suspected.

But it also has something else.

SAM

And what's that?

JEREMY

An unrecognizable element. I've

done all the tests. It doesn't

exist on the periodic table.

SAM

So this is pretty major.

JEREMY

This is history. I'm thinking of

calling it framium.

SAM

Framium?

JEREMY

For my last name... Frame.

78.

SAM

What if it's like... proof of some

alien life-form from another galaxy

or something.

JEREMY

It's very important you promise me

you won't tell anyone else what

I've showed you. I have to wait

till just the right moment. NASA,

or some secret government

organization could come in here and

take it away from me...

JEREMY (CONT'D)

And then later on, years from now,

take credit for the discovery

themselves.

SAM

I won't say anything.

JEREMY

Good.

SAM

There's this book I think you'd

like... I got it from my physics

teacher in high school.

JEREMY

The study of physics has unraveled

some of the most profound mysteries

of the universe.

SAM

It's called The Philosophy of Time

Travel.

JEREMY

Time travel?

SAM

Yeah, but it's not really that.

It's more like one scenario, or one

type of scenario. I don't

completely understand it...

79.

SAM (CONT'D)

Another mystery.

JEREMY

What do you mean?

SAM

My life seems to be full of them.

JEREMY

Mysteries are what make life

interesting...

JEREMY (CONT'D)

You're a mystery to me, Samantha.

JEREMY (CONT'D)

Ow...

SAM

That doesn't look good.

JEREMY

I should get some Hydrocortisone.

SAM

(regarding the attempted

KISS)

Sorry about that.

JEREMY

I'm sorry. I should've know better.

You barely know me, right?

SAM

And nobody really calls my

Samantha. Just my mom and dad.

80.

FATHER HOMEIJER

You take this street, I'll take

that one?

TRUDY

Good luck.

81.

FATHER HOMEIJER

Dusty?

FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)

Are you home, son?

FATHER HOMEIJER

(calling out)

Dusty? I'd like to trouble you for

a small donation...

82.

FATHER HOMEIJER

Who's there?

OFFICER O'DELL

Get in there, you sick fuck...

83.

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

(regarding Dusty)

Let him rot in there for a few

minutes, maybe till the news guys

show up... I'm gonna go finish

checkin' upstairs.

TELEVISION ANCHOR

We have an update this morning on

our breaking news of Billy

Moorcroft, the El Reno youth who

was kidnapped over 15 months ago,

and rescued yesterday afternoon by

Father Homeijer of Mount Calvary

Church. Billy's condition at this

time is considered stable...

FIELD REPORTER

Father, what led you to this

particular house on this particular

day?

84.

FATHER HOMEIJER

I was out collecting donations in

order to help rebuild my church,

Mount Calvary, which recently

burned down. Clearly the Lord works

in mysterious ways. This is nothing

less than divine intervention...

AGATHA (V.O.)

No matter how well you think you

know somebody, you just never

really know...

AGATHA

Dusty Gibbens has been comin' in

here for coffee ever since I can

remember... gives me the shivers.

TED

They should hang guys like that.

Only thing bothers me is how many

of `em are still out there...

TED (CONT'D)

Hang `em all.

AGATHA

(to Sam)

I'll be right back with your

breakfast.

CHRIS

May I?

SAM

Sure.

85.

CHRIS

I guess you heard.

SAM

Yeah.

CHRIS

It's so messed up... I feel bad

that I recommended him now.

AGATHA

What can I get you, honey?

CHRIS

Uh... sausage, eggs, coffee,

please.

AGATHA

White or wheat?

CHRIS

Wheat toast, please...

CHRIS (CONT'D)

If I had kids, I'd be worried sick

about `em in a world like this. I'm

sure your parents must be.

SAM

Hey, you could've been some crazy

rapist serial killer.

SAM (CONT'D)

You turned out okay.

CHRIS

Yeah, but everybody doesn't.

SAM

I can take care of myself.

CHRIS

I'm sure you can... but I wouldn't

feel right if I didn't tell you

about Jeremy.

86.

SAM

What about him?

CHRIS

I don't know what you have goin'

with him... but you shouldn't be

hangin' around him. Let's just

leave it at that.

SAM

What makes you think you can tell

me who I can and can't hang around

with?

CHRIS

It's just that I know him better

than you do. He lived in my

neighborhood when we were kids.

SAM

So?

CHRIS

So he used to do weird stuff... to

animals.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

My sister lost her pet rabbit once,

and we went all over the

neighborhood lookin' for it. We

were just about to call it quits

when we heard something comin' from

Jeremy's garage. He'd stuck it in a

trash can and put the lid on.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

It was half starved by the time we

got it home. Died just a few days

later.

SAM

How old was he?

CHRIS

I don't know, just a couple years.

Cute little black and white-

SAM

No. Jeremy.

87.

CHRIS

He was like nine, probably.

SAM

He was just a kid, he didn't know

what he was doing.

CHRIS

When you were nine years old did

you know it was wrong to put a

living creature in the trash can

and leave it there?

SAM

Chris... you're a nice guy, but you

don't have to be looking out for

me. You're not my dad, you're not

my big brother...

OFFICER O'DELL

You know what they do to faggot-ass

perverts like you in maximum

security, dontcha?

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

Disgusting fuckin' piece a' shit

like you...

OFFICER HINES

Hey, O'Dell...

OFFICER O'DELL

I'm on my way out... what do you

need?

88.

OFFICER HINES

I'm not gonna bullshit ya.

OFFICER O'DELL

Okay...

OFFICER HINES

I saw you snatch the drugs outta

that house.

OFFICER O'DELL

I don't think I know what the hell

you're talkin' about.

OFFICER HINES

Don't bullshit me either...

OFFICER HINES (CONT'D)

I don't wanna turn you in.

OFFICER O'DELL

Then what do you want?

OFFICER HINES

How much you think you'll get when

you unload it?

OFFICER O'DELL

Depends.

OFFICER HINES

I'll take forty percent this time,

but from now on it's fifty-fifty.

OFFICER O'DELL

What do you mean from now on?

OFFICER HINES

I got a pretty good idea this ain't

the first time you done this. Won't

be the last, will it?

89.

OFFICER O'DELL

Shit!

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

Come on outta there. Now!

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

What the fuck you doin' carryin'

that around in the town proper?

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

Hand it over. Right now!

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

I should arrest you and throw you

in jail, you know that? Crazy

sonofabitch...

OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)

Get the fuck outta my sight.

90.

SAM

Sorry...

VIETNAM TOM

My mom told me someday everybody

would understand. She said it was

my job to look out for the town...

so that's what I do. That's what I

always do.

VIETNAM TOM (CONT'D)

They don't know why. They don't

even want me here, but I still have

to protect them.

SAM

They're lucky to have someone to

protect them.

VIETNAM TOM

I'm used to it... I'm lucky to have

a job to do. Some people don't have

any reason to be here at all.

SAM

I know what you mean...

91.

VIETNAM TOM

You're more important than all of

us.

SAM

Do you like to read?

SAM (CONT'D)

You can borrow it...

JEREMY

Sam...

SAM

Oh, hi Jeremy.

JEREMY

Hi... sorry.

SAM

That's okay, what's up?

92.

JEREMY

Nothing... just that I haven't see

you around for the past few days. I

was worried. I thought you might've

taken off.

SAM

No... I've been around. Going for

lots of walks.

JEREMY

I stopped by the motel.

SAM

Like I said, I've been in and out.

JEREMY

Well, there's something I wanted to

ask you. You know that book you

mentioned?

SAM

Yeah...

JEREMY

I'd really love to check it out.

SAM

Oh...

JEREMY

You said you'd show it to me

sometime, and I've got a hunch it

could really help me in some of my

studies related to-

SAM

I don't have it anymore.

JEREMY

What?

SAM

I kind of... gave it to someone.

JEREMY

To who? Why?

93.

SAM

I'm sorry. I just... forgot that I

said you could borrow it, and this

GUY-

JEREMY

What guy?

SAM

Well... that Vietnam Tom guy.

JEREMY

Vietnam Tom!? You gave away the

book to Vietnam Tom!?

JEREMY (CONT'D)

I don't fucking believe what you're

telling me!

SAM

It's just a book...

JEREMY

He's a fucking bum! And you chose

him over me!?

SAM

No... I just-

CHRIS

That's enough.

JEREMY

This is none of your business.

CHRIS

It is, actually. You're disturbing

my customers. Get out.

94.

SAM

(MUTTERING)

You didn't have to do that.

CHRIS

Just doin' my job.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

(as he's walking away)

You're welcome.

TRUDY

I never had any doubts in you, or

in the Lord.

FATHER HOMEIJER

I know that. And we both truly

appreciate all your faith and hard

work...

FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)

We needed a miracle, but we got two

instead.

FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)

I think I've had enough.

TRUDY

One more glass won't hurt you. You

deserve it, Father...

OFFICER HINES

Where the hell are they?

95.

OFFICER O'DELL

They'll be here. Just take it easy.

VIETNAM TOM

Why do you talk to me?

SAM

Same reason you talk to me...

SAM (CONT'D)

Because I can see how special you

are.

VIETNAM TOM

Why can't other people?

SAM

They will. Only one day left.

FATHER HOMEIJER

Trudy...

96.

TRUDY

I see the way you look at me,

Father...

TRUDY (CONT'D)

I want you too.

TRUDY (CONT'D)

I can't do this. I'm a man of the

cloth... and you'd regret it.

TRUDY

I feel like such an idiot...

97.

OFFICER HINES

What the fuck-

98.

COP #1

Get down on the ground!

COP #1 (CONT'D)

Get down on the ground, now!

POLICEMAN (V.O.)

Name?

POLICEMAN (CONT'D)

(getting angry)

What's your name?

YOUNG OFFICER

We found this on him...

99.

JEREMY

Hi, Sam...

JEREMY (CONT'D)

I hope you can forgive the way I

acted.

SAM

That was pretty weird.

JEREMY

I know. I just...

JEREMY (CONT'D)

I've been so wrapped up with the

meteorite. I haven't been eating or

sleeping much. I think I'm just

drained... but that's no excuse.

SAM

It's alright.

JEREMY

I was wondering if you'd let me

make it up to you.

SAM

You don't need to-

JEREMY

Please... let me take you to watch

the fireworks tonight.

SAM

I don't think so.

JEREMY

It's gonna be spectacular. There's

gonna be a meteor shower that

coincides with the show... I mean,

how often does that happen?

JEREMY (CONT'D)

I just wanna be your friend.

SAM

I was supposed to see `em with

Chris, but... he's stuck at work.

100.

JEREMY

So, what do you say? Will you go

with me?

SAM

Gimme a sec. Lemme grab my

sweatshirt...

SAM

Shouldn't we go back out there

where we can see?

JEREMY

No, this'll be perfect. See right

there?

JEREMY (CONT'D)

That's right where the fireworks'll

come up.

(MORE)

101.

JEREMY (CONT'D)

And we can see the meteors better

without all the lights from the

town.

SAM

So what's in the bag?

JEREMY

You'll see...

JEREMY (CONT'D)

There's one!

JEREMY (O.S.)

Here it goes!

SAM

They're pretty.

JEREMY

You wanna try one?

JEREMY (CONT'D)

Just hold it straight up.

JEREMY (CONT'D)

It's goin'!

102.

SAM

Ow!

JEREMY

Drop it!

JEREMY (CONT'D)

Fucking faulty one...

JEREMY (CONT'D)

Are you okay?

SAM

I think so...

JEREMY

You need to get that covered...

SAM

What are you doing?

JEREMY

It's okay...

103.

JEREMY

How's it feel?

SAM

A little better...

SAM (CONT'D)

Good God...

SAM (CONT'D)

(ALARMED)

Is that from the meteorite?

JEREMY

I barely even notice it anymore.

I'm sure it'll go away soon.

SAM

Are you fucking kidding me?

JEREMY

Do you think I'm disgusting?

SAM

No... I just think you should get

it looked at-

SAM (CONT'D)

What the hell are you doing?

104.

JEREMY

So you do find me disgusting. Which

is it, Sam, I can't take much more

of this shit!

SAM

Jesus Christ...

JEREMY

Come here!

JEREMY

Sam! Stop!

JEREMY (CONT'D)

FUCK!

SAM

Why are you doing this?

JEREMY

I just wanna talk to you!

105.

JEREMY (CONT'D)

Stop it!

JEREMY (CONT'D)

Fucking bitch!

JEREMY

Sam?...

106.

CHRIS

Where the hell is Sam?

JEREMY

(FRANTIC)

I don't know... I don't know...

CHRIS

No...

107.

SAM (V.O.)

15 days... 18 hours...

SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)                 VIETNAM TOM

108.

109.

SAM

Oh my God...

FRANK

I don't believe it...

FRANK (CONT'D)

This is just a tragedy.

OFFICER O'DELL

Sell that thing off to some

meteorologist nerd club, I bet you

could do okay.

FRANK

Do I look like the type of guy

that's gonna try and profit off

another man's death? You should be

ashamed of yourself.

OFFICER O'DELL

(EMBARRASSED)

I was just sayin'...

COREY

What are you doing?

110.

CHRIS

Hey...

SAM

Hey.

CHRIS

So you guys stayed here last night?

COREY

One of us did.

CHRIS

What's up with your car?

COREY

It's gonna take a couple days.

CHRIS

For a water pump?

CHRIS (CONT'D)

It's none of my business, but...

SAM

What?

CHRIS

I was just gonna say, if you

wanted, I could give you a ride

back.

CHRIS (CONT'D)

You too. I mean, I could give you

both a ride.

COREY

To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you-

SAM

(INTERRUPTING)

I'll go.

111.

COREY

(PISSED)

What?

SAM

I think I wanna go.

COREY

Things get a little tough, you're

just gonna give up?

SAM

It's not like that... You should

come too.

COREY

Fuck that. I'll wait for my car and

stick to the plan. Do whatever the

fuck you want.

SAM

Corey...

CHRIS

Sorry to screw you guys up.

SAM

It's alright. She can take care of

herself... she's good at it. I've

gotta go home.
