SEVEN

Andrew Kevin Walker

January 27,1992

The world is a fine place,

and worth fighting for.

- Ernest Hemingway

For Whom the Bell Tolls

1940

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Is something wrong?

MAN (CONT)

Is something the matter?

SOMERSET

No... no.  There's nothing wrong.

MAN

(writes receipt)

Not that it's any of my business... but,

are you figuring on moving out here

eventually?

SOMERSET

Soon.

MAN

I just never seen a man mortgaging an

empty house before.

SOMERSET

Everything here still seems... seems so

strange to me.  All this.

MAN

I don't know.  I'd say this place is

about as normal as places get.

SOMERSET

That is exactly what I mean.  Strange.

MILLS

Is that your car, man?

FIRST THUG

What the fuck do you care?

MILLS

Does that car belong to you?

FIRST THUG

Yeah, it's my car, alright?  Fuck off.

MILLS

You're telling me that's your car?

SECOND THUG

Well, for some strange reason, I don't

believe you.

FIRST THUG

(steps forward)

You can fucking suck my...

TAYLOR

Neighbors heard them screaming at each

other.  It was nothing new or unusual.

But, then they heard the gun go off.

Boom, boom... both barrels.

SOMERSET

Did his wife confess?  Did she actually

speak the words?

TAYLOR

When the patrolman got here she was

trying to put his head back together.

She was crying too hard to say anything.

(shuts notebook)

Crime of passion.

SOMERSET

Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered

up on the wall here.

TAYLOR

This is a done deal.  All but the

paperwork.

SOMERSET

Did their son see it happen?

TAYLOR

What kind of question is that?  Huh?

(pointing)

He's dead.  His wife killed him.  There

it is.  That's all.  Anything else has

nothing to do with nothing.

TAYLOR (CONT)

You and your fucking questions,

Somerset.  I'm glad I'm getting rid of

you today.  You know that, you fuck?

MILLS

Uh... Lieutenant Somerset?

MILLS (CONT)

I'm David Mills... your new partner.

MILLS

I'm a little thrown.  I just finished

orientation at central, and they dumped

me off down here.

SOMERSET

I heard you brought in two small-timers

last night.

MILLS

Yeah.  Two real idiots.

SOMERSET

Since we are just starting out, I

thought we could go to a bar.  Sit and

talk for awhile.  That way we can...

MILLS

Excuse me, but I'd rather start sniffing

for a case, if it's all the same to you.

Seeing how we only have a week for this

whole transition thing.

(waits)

I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p.,

know what I mean?

SOMERSET

I meant to ask you something... when we

spoke on the phone.  I can't help

wondering...

(pause)

Why are you here?

MILLS

(wary)

I... I don't follow.

SOMERSET

All this effort you've gone through, to

be transferred from Philadelphia to

here.  It's the first question that pops

into my head.

MILLS

I'm here for the same reasons as you, I

guess.  Or... at least the same reasons

you used to have for being here...

(cutting)

...before you decided to give up.

SOMERSET

You think you know me?  You just met me

two minutes ago.

MILLS

Maybe I don't understand the question.

SOMERSET

It's very simple.  You've come from the

"City of Brotherly Love" to the "City of

Brotherly Hate," detective.  I've never

seen it done that way.

MILLS

I don't know.  Maybe I thought I could

do more good here than there.

(pause)

You know, it'd be great by me if we

didn't start right out kicking each

other in the balls.  But, you're calling

the shots, lieutenant, so however you

want it to go.

SOMERSET

Let me tell you how I want this to go.

I want you to look, and I want you to

listen.

MILLS

I wasn't standing around Philly guarding

the fucking Liberty Bell.

SOMERSET

But, you've never worked homicide in

this

city.

MILLS

I realize that.

SOMERSET

Well, please do me the favor of

remembering it.

SOMERSET

At what time did you confirm the death?

DAVIS

Like I said, we didn't touch anything,

but we were on scene at like o-five-

hundred, so he's had his face in a plate

of spaghetti for about half an hour.

MILLS

Wait, wait, wait.  You didn't check him?

You didn't check vital signs?

DAVIS

Believe me, he's gone.  Unless he's

breathing spaghetti sauce now.

MILLS

No.  The point is, when you're first man

in, you check vital signs.

DAVIS

This guy's sitting in a pile of his own

shit and piss.  If he ain't dead he

would have stood up by now.

MILLS

(getting angry)

Listen, Godzilla...

SOMERSET

Thank you, Officer Davis.  We'll see you

again after we've had a look.

DAVIS

Yes, sir.

SOMERSET

I wonder what exactly was the point of

the conversation you were about to get

into?

MILLS

And, I wonder how many times Officer

Davis there has found a supposedly dead

man who didn't really die until Davis

was back in the patrol car calling the

morgue and eating a powdered donut.

SOMERSET

Drop it.  We have more important

concerns just now, don't we?

MILLS

Fine... for now.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Bon appetit.

MILLS

I guess that makes it homicide.

MILLS (CONT)

Still, he could have tied himself in.

To make it look like murder.

MILLS (CONT)

I don't see any blood or bruises yet.

No wounds.  You see anything?

SOMERSET

(irritated)

Not yet.

MILLS

I saw a guy once... committed suicide,

but he wanted to make sure his family

could collect insurance money, right?

MILLS (CONT)

So, this guy took this big knife... and

he held it behind him, put the tip of it

in his back, and he ran backwards into

the wall.  Cause, he thought it was

going to look like someone stabbed him

in the back.

MILLS (CONT)

Except, he poked a big fucking hole in

the dry wall when he did it.

SOMERSET

If you could... spare me the anecdotes

for now.  Leave the refrigerator open

for the light.

MILLS

(sarcastic)

Oh, forgive me.  I thought we had this

male-bonding thing going.  My mistake.

SOMERSET

What do you smell?  Other than him, and

all the food.

MILLS

(sniffs)

I don't know... there's something.

SOMERSET

A bucket.

MILLS

It's vomit.

MILLS (CONT)

It's a bucket of vomit.

SOMERSET

Is there any blood in it?

MILLS

Can't tell by looking.

O'NEILL

Mood lighting.  Very sixties.

MILLS

(to Somerset)

You think he was poisoned?

MILLS (CONT)

And, those rats there somehow ate the

poison off the floor?

SOMERSET

Guessing this early is useless.

O'NEILL

You girls have got the forensics guys

out there chompin' at the bit.  Don't

know if we'll all fit in here though.

MILLS

There's room.  Light's the problem.

SOMERSET

Well, three is certainly a crowd in

here.  And, with four, someone's bound

to be stepping on evidence.

(pause)

Detective Mills, go help the officers

question the neighbors.

MILLS

(not pleased)

Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll stay on

this.

SOMERSET

(not looking up)

Send one forensic in on your way out.

O'NEILL

He is dead.

SOMERSET

Pizza and paperwork, Detective Mills.

MILLS

We need to chat.

SOMERSET

No.

MILLS

You just hold them up.  I do all the

work.

MILLS (CONT)

You've seen my files... seen the things

I've done?

SOMERSET

Yes.  Impressive work.

MILLS

So, what's your problem?  I've done my

time on door-to-doors, and walking a

beat.

SOMERSET

I know it.  That doesn't mean...

MILLS

I did all that shit a long time ago.

SOMERSET

I made a decision, because I have to

worry about the integrity of the scene.

MILLS

That's bullshit.

SOMERSET

When I'm on scene, I'm not going to

worry whether you think you're getting

enough time on the playing field.  I'm

there to do the work.

MILLS

The badge in my pocket says "detective,"

just like yours.  I've been Homicide for

four and a half years.

SOMERSET

You've worked Homicide for four years,

or for five years...

Don't count the half-years, unless you

want

to sound like a rookie.

MILLS

Oops.  My hand slipped.

MILLS (CONT)

You fucked me over today, and you know

it.  You know it.

MILLS (CONT)

Just don't jerk me off.  That's all I

ask.  It's not much.  Don't jerk me off.

(pause)

Please, do me the favor of remembering

that.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

I'm sorry, Mrs. Mills.  We don't have

anything right now.

WOMAN (CONT)

We'll try to give you a call if we need

substitutes next month.

TRACY

Thank you.

MILLS

It was okay.  I mean... it was certainly

better than yesterday.  I think Somerset

and I came to a small understanding...

MILLS (CONT)

...about this big.

TRACY

He sounds interesting.

MILLS

He is that, if nothing else.

MILLS (CONT)

We started a big homicide case today.

I'll spare you the grisly details.

STRANGE MAN

Name that tune?  Anybody name that tune?

Name that tune...

TRACY

It's... it's like they emptied all the

insane asylums into the streets.

TRACY (CONT)

That's what it's like.  Like they just

gave up, and let everyone out.

TRACY (CONT)

There are a lot of frightening people in

this city.

MILLS

There are a lot of frightening people in

the world.

STRANGE MAN

Name that tune?  Anybody name that tune?

TRACY

It seems worse than Philadelphia,

because everything is pushed right up

against you.  In your face.

MILLS

Listen, honey.  I don't want to fight

tonight.  Okay?  Can we just go one

night without fighting about something?

TRACY

I'm not trying to start a fight.

(pause)

How am I trying to start a fight?

MILLS

We're here now.  Okay.  Are we supposed

to pack it all in and go back?  How are

we going to do that?

TRACY

Do I have to act like I love this place?

Is that what a "good wife" would do?

MILLS

(doleful)

There's a lot of pressure on me... I...

TRACY

And, there's a lot of pressure on me.

I'm here with you.

MILLS

I know.  I know...

TRACY

I'm not going to close my eyes and block

everything out, David.  I'm not going to

act like you delivered us to some sort

of paradise.  I can't...

MILLS

Fuck you.

(as car leaves)

Fuck you, you son of a bitch!  I'm

walking here.

MILLS

I'm sorry... I couldn't pass it up.  I

never had a chance to actually do that.

But, we can start the argument right

back up where we left off, right?

MILLS

(playing dumb)

What?

STRANGE MAN

That was the theme from tv's Mod Squad.

I'm surprised nobody got that one.

OLD MAN

(infuriated)

Excuse me.  Excuse me!

TRACY

Goodnight.

MILLS

Goodnight.

SANTIAGO

If you take a look here, buddies...

I can tell you, it was not a poison.

If you can see...

I have emptied all of everything out of

the stomach.  But, look at it, now that

I took away the liver.

SANTIAGO (CONT)

I move the lungs over.  First, see how

big this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is.

Now... here is the strange thing, on the

stomach.  Stretches.

(pointing)

And, here is it distended.  Look at the

size of that, because of the foods.

MILLS

I can see what you're pointing at...

SANTIAGO

On the stomach.  The lines of

distention.

SOMERSET

Doctor, are you saying this man... ate

till he burst?

SANTIAGO

Yes, well, he didn't actually burst.  He

was bleeding, inside of himself.

And, there's a hemotoma on the

outside... on the belly.

MILLS

He died by eating?

SANTIAGO

Someone punched him, or kicked him.

SANTIAGO (CONT)

Oh, and there is this here... something

else you have to look at and see.

SANTIAGO (CONT)

Most of his stomach contents are in the

lab now... but, this.  I found these in

the fat man's stomach.

MILLS

Plastic?

SANTIAGO

Why these were in a fat man's stomach, I

don't know.

SOMERSET

Those bruises on the back of the

victim's head were caused by the muzzle

of a gun.

MILLS

So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and

gave him a choice: eat, or get your head

blown off.

SOMERSET

He was force-fed... till his body

started rejecting the food.  He

literally couldn't eat another bite.

MILLS

So, the killer held a bucket under him.

SOMERSET

His throat was swollen from the effort.

He was bleeding internally.

He must have blacked out... and, if

you're the killer, you're not going to

want to wait around for him to die.

MILLS

You kick him, pop him like a fucking

balloon.

(touches floor)

Somerset, look here.

SOMERSET

Same color and texture.

MILLS

If this is what that is... it doesn't

make sense.  It doesn't figure.

SOMERSET

Always look for one thing to focus on.

There's always one singular thing, and

it might be as small as a speck of dust,

but find it and focus... till it's an

exhausted possibility.

MILLS

How are pieces of the floor going to get

in the guy's stomach?

SOMERSET

Exactly.  Why would so many pieces be

inside his stomach unless they were

placed there intentionally?

MILLS

"Dear Detectives.  Long is the way, and

hard, that out of hell leads up to the

light."

(looks at Somerset)

This is not good.

SOMERSET

Milton.

MILLS

What?

SOMERSET

It's a quote from a book.  Milton's

Paradise Lost.

DETECTIVE

I said to myself, I'm not going to screw

around with this.  Nope.  Fuck that.

It's still pretty fresh meat.  I called

the medical examiner... he's coming.

(stops at door)

When I got to it, I knew.  As soon as I

laid eyes on it, I knew...

DETECTIVE (O.S.)

...this is your guy who did this.

MILLS

(to Somerset)

A pound of flesh.

SOMERSET

(reading)

"One pound of flesh, no more no less. No

cartilage, no bone, but only flesh.

This task done, and he would go free."

SOMERSET (CONT)

This victim, Mr. Gold, was tied down

nude, holding a carving knife.  And he

was given a long time... to decide.

Where to make the first cut?  There's a

gun to your head... but, what part or

parts of your body are expendable?

SOMERSET (CONT)

Mr. Gold tried for the whole pound at

once, his love handle.  But, he went

into shock.  Bled to death.

CAPTAIN

What is the point, Somerset?

SOMERSET

Look at both killings together.  This

murderer is an artist.

CAPTAIN

An artist?

SOMERSET

He uses colors and symbols.  He

positions the bodies after death, so

he's working with composition.  It's

been premeditated

so

meticulously... and

this is just the beginning.

CAPTAIN

Wrong.  For all we know, we might never

hear from him again, and I don't want

that kind of talk floating around.

SOMERSET

The rats and the pennies.  The circle

and the triangle on the wall.  There's

something about them... these murders

mean

something.

CAPTAIN

So?  What?

CAPTAIN (CONT)

(to Mills)

You with him, or you just here to watch?

MILLS

This is his stuff, captain.  I've been

out in the cold most of the day.

CAPTAIN

(to Somerset)

Always working overtime up in that big

brain of yours, huh?  Always cooking.

SOMERSET

I need you to know... I want us

reassigned.  We're declining this case.

MILLS

(sits up, angry)

What?!

CAPTAIN

What the hell are you talking about?

SOMERSET

This cannot be my last duty here.  It's

going to go on and on.

CAPTAIN

You've left unfinished business before.

SOMERSET

Everything else was taken as close to a

conclusion as humanly possible.

MILLS

Can I just say something?

SOMERSET

Also... I don't think this should be

Mills' first case.

MILLS

This is not my first case, fuckhead!

CAPTAIN

I don't have anyone else to give this

to, Somerset.  And nobody's going to

swap

with you.

MILLS

Give it to me, then.  There's nothing

that says I have to fly with him.

MILLS (CONT)

If Somerset wants out, fuck him.

SOMERSET

It would be too much for him, too soon.

MILLS

(to captain)

Could we talk about this in private?

CAPTAIN

That's not necessary.  You're in.

MILLS

Thank you, sir.

CAPTAIN

Start picking up the pieces.  I'll

shuffle some paper and try to get you a

new partner.

CAPTAIN (CONT)

You win, Somerset.  You're out.

EXCLUSIVE DETAILS INSIDE

!!!

WORKMAN

Sorry.

CAPTAIN

What are you going to do with yourself

out there, Somerset?

SOMERSET

I'll get a job.  Maybe on a farm.  I'll

fix up my house.

CAPTAIN

Can't you feel it yet?

(pause)

Can't you feel that feeling... that you

won't be special anymore?

SOMERSET

(lying)

I don't know what you mean.

CAPTAIN

You know.

SOMERSET

Did you read in the paper today, about

the man who took his dog for a walk?

And how he was mugged?  And, his wallet

was taken, and his watch.  Then, while

he was still lying unconscious, his

attacker stabbed him with a knife in

both eyes.  It happened last night.  Not

far from here.

CAPTAIN

I heard.

SOMERSET

I have no understanding of this place.

CAPTAIN

It's always been like this.

SOMERSET

Yes.  You're absolutely right.

CAPTAIN

You were made for this work, Somerset.

I can't believe you're going to trade it

all in for a tool belt and a fishing

rod.  But, I guess I'm wrong.

SOMERSET

(angrily)

Put a little elbow grease into it!

MILLS

He must have left us another puzzle to

solve... somewhere.

CHRIS

We'll keep looking, but we're running

out of possibilities.

MILLS

Christ...

circles have been drawn in blood around the woman's eyes

.

VAGRANT

Spare me a cigarette, money-grip?  Spare

me a cigarette?

SOMERSET

Sorry.  Last one.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

I have voiced the same concerns to our

law enforcement officials, and they

assure me he is of the highest caliber.

A REPORTER (V.O.)

(from t.v.)

As District Attorney, don't you feel

some responsibility?  Detective David

Mills lacks the experience...

TALBOT (V.O.)

(from t.v.)

I've always said... I've always said,

don't send a boy to do a man's job.

TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)

But, David Mills has a sterling record

with the Philadelphia force.  I stand

behind him one hundred percent.

MILLS

(relieved)

You tell 'em boss.  Detective David

Mills is a wonderful human being...

TALBOT (V.O.)

However... however... let me say this...

TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)

If Detective Mills, at any point in this

investigation... if he is not pulling

his weight, I will be the first in line

to pull his plug.

WILLIAM

I always figured that's the only reason

you and I used to be friends.  Because I

was a friend of hers.

WILLIAM (CONT)

Speaking of which...

WILLIAM (CONT)

I painted that about five years ago.  I

always told myself I'd give it to you

next time I saw you.

WILLIAM (CONT)

Things are different these days, pal.

You wouldn't believe it...

WILLIAM (CONT)

People buy my paintings now... they

drive down in their BMWs and Rolls

Royces.  It's the new money generation.

I guess they think they're touching the

avant-garde...

WILLIAM (CONT)

There's another thousand dollar William

McCracken expression of anarchy.

WILLIAM (CONT)

Make that two thousand.

SOMERSET

How is she?  Have you seen her recently?

WILLIAM

Huh... oh.  No.  She moved out of the

city.  Last winter.  She married some

businessman, or something like that.

SOMERSET

Good for her.

(pause)

I'm leaving soon myself.  I'm finally

getting out.

WILLIAM

Yeah?  What happened to the idealistic

super-cop I used to know?

SOMERSET

He became a realist.

WILLIAM

Oh... sorry.

SOMERSET

(sarcastic)

Not that I don't appreciate your recent

artistic endeavors... but, what happened

to the painter I used to know?

WILLIAM

I can't remember.

WILLIAM

Man... can I buy these from you?

SOMERSET

They're not for sale.

SOMERSET (CONT)

What is it?  What's the murderer trying

to say?

SOMERSET (CONT)

What picture is he painting?

WILLIAM

(figuring)

Wait a minute...

WILLIAM (CONT)

I... I've seen things like that...

SOMERSET

Where?

WILLIAM

It's church stuff.  Christianity.

WILLIAM (CONT)

When it first started... Christian

artwork was all from Bible stories.  It

was like... nobody had any imagination.

It was all... standardized.

WILLIAM (O.S.,CONT)

But, later, everyone started painting to

tell their own stories... to teach

lessons.  Guys like Bosch, Bregel the

elder... Van Eycks.

SOMERSET (O.S.)

The seven deadly sins.

WILLIAM (O.S.)

That's what these murders remind me of.

Paintings like these.

(points)

Gluttony... greed...

SOMERSET (O.S.)

Envy, wrath, pride, lust and sloth.

Seven deadly sins.

WILLIAM

Amen, brother.

WILLIAM (CONT)

I can find more examples.  There's lots

of paintings like those... painted over

hundreds of years.

(moves books)

And you're right... that murderer is an

artist.

SOMERSET

And, it's two down... five to go.

PREACHER

...are you, Sir?  Is Jesus Christ your

Lord and Master?  Do you believe in Him?

PREACHER (CONT)

(pleading)

Don't ignore me.  Listen to what I have

to say.  Christ can be your savior!

JOHN

(quiet anger)

Leave me alone.

PREACHER

Think about God, sir.  I can help you

let Him into your life.

BARKER

Interesting isn't it, friend?  You like

that, you like girls, then come on in.

BARKER (CONT)

You'll see a lot more inside.  You'll

see a lot more than that.

TRACY

Can I help you?

SOMERSET

Uh... I was looking for Mills.  David, I

mean.

TRACY

He's not here right now.

SOMERSET

Mrs. Mills, my name is Somerset.  If I

could leave these books for him.

TRACY

(undoes chain)

Please, come in.

TRACY

David went for a walk.  To clear his

head.  Oh, you can put those here.

SOMERSET

Thank you.

SOMERSET (CONT)

Could you tell him... tell him this is

his reading assignment.  It's urgent.

I've marked the most important pages.

TRACY

Would you like some coffee, or a drink.

David should be back any minute.

SOMERSET

I do have to get going.

TRACY

At least I got to meet you.  David has

told me a lot about you.

SOMERSET

Really?  Good things, I hope.

TRACY

Oh, yes.  He said you were very smart.

SOMERSET

Really?

TRACY

I think he's a bit intimidated by you.

SOMERSET

I'm going to leave him a list of

specifics.  It all relates to the case

he's on.

TRACY

You two aren't working together anymore.

Isn't that so?

SOMERSET

To be perfectly honest, Mrs. Mills...

TRACY

Tracy.

SOMERSET

Tracy.  David and I weren't exactly what

you could call fast friends.

TRACY

That's too bad.

SOMERSET

I doubt your husband shares that

opinion.

TRACY

You know, Somerset, David is very...

determined.  I'm sure you've seen, it's

not likely he'll ever be compared to

Gandhi.

SOMERSET

He's a good cop.  He just...

TRACY

He sees policework as a crusade.  That's

what he wants it to be, and, that might

sound naive, but he's made a conscious

choice to be naive.

(pause)

Believe me, his heart's in the right

place.

SOMERSET

I hear you and he were high school

sweethearts.

TRACY

Yeah.  Pretty hokey, huh?  But, what

girl wouldn't want the captain of the

football team as their lifelong mate?

SOMERSET

It's rare these days... that kind of

commitment.

TRACY

I guess so.

SOMERSET

Well... this will only take a minute.

TRACY

Take your time.

TRACY (CONT)

What is this?

SOMERSET

My future.

TRACY

You have a strange way about you,

Somerset... I mean in a good way...

unusual.

TRACY (CONT)

I apologize.  I'll get out of your hair.

TRACY (CONT)

It's just... it's nice to hear a man who

talks like that.  If David saw that

paper, he'd say you're acting like a

homosexual.  That's how he is.

SOMERSET

(mock indignation)

Well!  I guess I won't be showing this to

him then.

TRACY

I suppose not.

-------------------------------------------------------------

MILLS

Fucking Dante.  Goddamn, poetry writing

freak, mother-fuck...

MILLS (CONT)

Good work, Officer.  Good work.

MILLS (CONT)

Thank God.

SOMERSET

How's it coming?

MILLS

Great.

2 greed(x)       6 pride

3 sloth          7 lust

4 envy

SOMERSET

It's your name on the door.

MILLS

(into phone)

Detective Mills here.

(lowers voice)

Honey, I asked you not to call unless...

(listens)

What... why?  Okay... okay.  Hold on.

MILLS (CONT)

It's my wife.

SOMERSET

(into phone)

Hello?

(listens)

Yes, well... I appreciate the thought,

but... I...

(listens)

Well, I guess I'd be delighted to.

Thank you... goodbye.

MILLS

Well?

SOMERSET

I'm invited to have a late supper with

you and your wife.  And I accept.

MILLS

How's that?

SOMERSET

(sits back down)

Tonight.

TRACY

Why aren't you married, Somerset?

MILLS

Tracy.  What the hell?

SOMERSET

I was close.  It just didn't happen.

TRACY

It surprises me you're not married.  It

really does.

SOMERSET

Any person who spends a significant

amount of time with me finds me...

disagreeable.  Just ask your husband.

MILLS

No argument.

TRACY

(to Somerset)

How long have you lived here?

SOMERSET

Too long.  Much too long.

(drinks)

What do you think of our fair city?

TRACY

You take the bad with the good, I

suppose.  It's... it's...

MILLS

It takes time to settle in.

SOMERSET

(to Tracy)

You'll get used to it pretty quickly.

There are things in any big city that

stand out at first.  But...

TRACY

Subway train.  It's right below us/

TRACY (CONT)

It'll go away in a minute.

MILLS

(uncomfortable)

This real estate guy... a real scum,

brought us to see this place a few

times.  And, it was nice enough, and the

price was right.  I was thinking it was

nothing, but I started to notice, he

kept hurrying us along.  I mean what

could it be?  Why would he only show it

like five minutes at a time, before he'd

hustle us out the door?

TRACY

We found out the first night.

SOMERSET

I'm sorry... it's a nice apartment.

MILLS

(sighs)

Oh, fuck.

SOMERSET

All television does is teach children

that it's really cool to be stupid and

eat candy bars all day.

TRACY

I don't think I've ever met anyone who

didn't have a television.

MILLS

That's weird.  It's un-American.

MILLS (CONT)

What about sports?

SOMERSET

What about them?

MILLS

You go to movies at least.

SOMERSET

I read.  Remember reading?  What's the

last book you read, Mills?

MILLS

T.V. Guide.

MILLS (CONT)

Excuse me.

(to Somerset)

I just have to say, I can't respect any

man who's never seen Green Acres.

MILLS (CONT)

You've never seen The Odd Couple?  The

Flintstones?

SOMERSET

I vaguely recall Wilma, and someone

named... Dino.

MILLS

We think he acted like he was delivering

a package.  The doorman at Mr. Gold's

building says he doesn't even look at

anyone who goes in anymore.

SOMERSET

No connection between the two victims?

SOMERSET (CONT)

No witnesses of any kind?

MILLS

None.  Which I can't understand.  It's

like this guy's invisible.

SOMERSET

In this city, minding your own business

is a perfected science.

SOMERSET (CONT)

At the precinct, Sunday nights, they

offer a public crime prevention course.

And, the very first thing they teach is

that you should never scream "help" if

you're in trouble.  Scream "fire."

Because people don't want to get caught

up in anything.  But, a fire... that's

entertainment.  They come running.

SOMERSET (CONT)

"The Sun in Splendor with the Eye."  It

refers to God the father, and to Saint

Thomas Aquinas.

MILLS

Which saint is he?

SOMERSET

Aquinas wrote a summary of theology,

Summa Theologica.  And he wrote about

the seven deadly sins.

SOMERSET (CONT)

Now, what else have you got?

MILLS

Look, I appreciate being able to talk

this out, but... it's my case.

SOMERSET

So... satisfying my curiosity.  I'm

still leaving town on Sunday.

MILLS

The eyes were circled.  With Mr. Gold's

blood.

SOMERSET

This is his wife?

MILLS

(nods)

She was away on business.  She got back

the day he was killed.  If this means

she saw anything, I don't know what.

We've questioned her about ten times.

SOMERSET

And, if it's a threat?

MILLS

We put her in a safe house.

SOMERSET

This is the one thing.

MILLS

I know.

SOMERSET

It's like he's preaching.

(pause)

The sins were used in medieval sermons.

There were seven cardinal virtues, and

then seven deadly sins, as a learning

tool.  The sins distract man from true

worship.  True faith.

MILLS

Like in these paintings, and in Dante's

Purgatory, right?  But, in Purgatory,

Dante and his buddy climb that big

mountain...

SOMERSET

Seven Terraces of Purgation.

MILLS

Anyway... pride comes first, not

gluttony.  And in all the paintings,

the sins are in a different order.  I

can't find a pattern.

SOMERSET

Because there's creativity in the mix.

Consider these books as the murderer's

inspiration.  Or aspiration.

SOMERSET (CONT)

He sees himself contributing to the body

of Christian work.

MILLS

He's punishing these people.

SOMERSET

For all of us to see and learn from.

These murders are like forced attrition.

MILLS

What?  Forced what?

SOMERSET

Attrition.  When you regret your sins,

but not because you love God.

MILLS

Because someone's holding a gun on you.

SOMERSET

When Mr. Gold's wife found the body,

about how long was she in the apartment?

MILLS

She didn't find it.  The door to the

apartment was open and a neighbor...

SOMERSET

I thought you said she found the body.

When she got back from a business trip.

MILLS

No.  She got back after you and I had

already been there.

MILLS (CONT)

What?

SOMERSET

Maybe she is supposed to see

something... she just hasn't had a

chance to see it yet.

MILLS

Please, look for anything strange or out

of place.  Anything at all.

MRS GOLD

I... I don't understand.  Why now?

MILLS

I need your help if we're going to get

the guy who killed your husband.  If

there's anything in these pictures...

MRS GOLD

I don't see anything.

MILLS

Are you absolutely sure?

MRS GOLD

I can't do this now... please.

We have to show her those.  There might

be something she's missing.

SOMERSET

Have her look one last time.

MRS GOLD

Wait.  Here... here's something...

MILLS

What is it?

MRS GOLD

This painting... in the living room...

MILLS

What?

MRS GOLD

Why is it hanging upside-down?

MILLS

Nothing.

SOMERSET

This has got to be it.

SOMERSET (CONT)

It has to be.  He changed the wire to

rehang it.

MILLS

It's nothing.

MILLS (CONT)

Give it up.  The killer didn't paint the

fucking thing.

MILLS (CONT)

He fucked us.

MILLS (CONT)

Son of a bitch!

MILLS (CONT)

What?

SOMERSET

Bear with me.

MILLS

(incredulous)

Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding.

SOMERSET

Shut up and wait!

SOMERSET (CONT)

Call the print lab.  Now.

FORENSIC

Oh, boy...

MILLS (O.S.)

Talk to me.

MILLS (CONT)

(to Somerset)

Listen, honestly... have you ever seen

anything like this?  Been involved in

anything remotely like this?

SOMERSET

No.  I have not.

FORENSIC (O.S.)

Well, I can tell you this, detectives...

FORENSIC (CONT)

...just by studying the underloop...

these are

not

the victim's prints.

SOMERSET

It doesn't work for me.  I can't believe

he wants us to help him stop.

MILLS

Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of

schizoids out there doing dirty deeds

they don't want to do.  With tiny voices

whispering nasty things in their ears.

TECHNICIAN

I've seen this baby take three days to

finish a cycle, so you guys can go cross

your fingers somewhere else.

SOMERSET

You really meant what you said to Mrs.

Gold.  You really believe we'll get him,

don't you?

MILLS

And you don't?

SOMERSET

I wish I still thought like you.  I'm so

far gone from that.

MILLS

So, tell me what you think we're doing.

SOMERSET

All we do is pick up the pieces.  We

take all the evidence... all the

pictures, statements.  Write everything

down and note what time things happened.

We take it all, make a nice, neat pile

and file it away.  Just in case it's

ever needed in a courtroom.

MILLS

You're unbelievable.  In my entire life,

you're the oldest man I've ever met.

SOMERSET

I've seen even the most promising clues

lead to dead ends.  Hundreds of times.

MILLS

I've seen the same.  I'm not the country

hick-boy you seem to think I am.

SOMERSET

In this city, if all the skeletons came

out of all the closets... if every un-

revenged corpse were to suddenly rise

and walk again, there would be no more

room for the living.

MILLS

Don't try to tell me you didn't get that

rush tonight... that adrenalin.  Like we

were getting somewhere.

(pause)

And, don't try to tell me it was because

you thought we found something that

would play well in a courtroom.

CAPTAIN

Wake up, Glimmer Twins.  We have a

winner.

CAPTAIN

His street name is Zero, as some of you

know.  His prints were found at the

scene by Detectives Mills and Somerset.

CAPTAIN (CONT)

Now, Zero has a long, long history of

mental illness.  Serious illness.  He

was all over your television sets two

years ago after he raped and killed a

seventy-three year old woman.  He got

off, as the saying goes, on a

technicality.  So we watched him on the

streets, and he went out of circulation

about a year ago.

FEMALE COP

If he disappeared, what do you want from

us?

CAPTAIN

His last place of residence is still in

his name.  A search warrant is being

pushed through the court as we speak.

CALIFORNIA

So, have the housing cops walk up and

ring the doorbell.  Problem solved.

CAPTAIN

Listen, California.  When you go in, if

Zero isn't home, some of his buddies

might be house-sitting.  And besides

using, Zero deals, so, you will be very

uninvited guests.

SOMERSET

Does not seem like our killer, does it?

MILLS

You tell me.  I'm new in town.

SOMERSET

Zero does possess the requisite degree

of insanity... but, he doesn't have the

desire somehow.  Our killer seems to

have more purpose.  More purpose than

Zero could ever conceive of.

MILLS

We'll tag along.

SOMERSET

Why would we?

MILLS

Satisfy our curiosity?

MILLS

You ever take one?

SOMERSET

No.  Never in twenty-four years.  I took

my gun out only five times with the

actual intention of using it.  I never

fired it.  Not once.

MILLS

I pulled it once, fired it once.  I

never took a bullet.

SOMERSET

And?

MILLS

It was my first one of these.  We were a

secondary unit, in vice.  I was pretty

shaky going in.  When we busted the

door, looking for a junkie, the fucking

guy opened fire.  One cop was hit in the

arm.  He went flying... like in slow

motion.

(pause)

I remember riding in the ambulance.  His

arm was like... a piece of meat.  I

thought, it's just his arm.  But, he

bled to death right there anyway.

SOMERSET

How did the fire-fight end?

MILLS

Well, I was doing really good in Philly

up till then.  Lots of simple busts.

I've always had this weird luck... but,

this was wild.

(pause)

I got that fuck with one shot... right

between the eyes.  And the next week,

the mayor's pinning a medal on me.

Picture in the paper, the whole nine

yards.

SOMERSET

How was it?

MILLS

I expected it to be bad, because I heard

about other guys.  You know... I took a

human life.  But, I slept like a baby

that night.

SOMERSET

I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I

can't remember where, but he wrote that,

in order to live in a city, you have to

have the ability to kill.  I think he

meant you truly must be able to do it,

not just faking it, to survive.

MILLS

Sounds like he knew what he was talking

about.

CALIFORNIA

(to black cop)

This is it.  Give it up.

CALIFORNIA (CONT)

Police!!  Open the door!

CALIFORNIA

Good morning, Sweetheart!

MILLS

Get up now, motherfucker!  Now!

MILLS

I said get up, Sleepyhead!

CALIFORNIA

Oh, fuck me!

MILLS

Holy shit.

SOMERSET

Sloth... it's sloth.

BLACK COP

What the hell... those are dead worms.

CALIFORNIA

(to Somerset)

Check this out, dick.

MILLS

It's him.  It's Zero.

SOMERSET

Someone call an ambulance.

CALIFORNIA

Someone call a hearse, more like.

BLOND COP

What the fuck is going on?

MILLS

Hey, California.  Get your people out.

CALIFORNIA

You heard him.  Hit the hall, and don't

touch anything.

CALIFORNIA (CONT)

It looks like he's some kind of friggin'

wax sculpture.

MILLS

Somerset, you... you better look here.

MILLS (CONT)

All pictures of Zero tied to the bed.

(crouches)

The last one's dated three days ago.

SOMERSET

(awed)

The first photo... it's dated one year

ago.  Almost to the day.

CALIFORNIA

Mo-ther...

MILLS

What's this?

CALIFORNIA

You got what you deserved, Zero.

MILLS

A urine sample... hair sample...

fingernail clippings.  He's laughing at

us.

CALIFORNIA

He's alive!

CALIFORNIA

He's still alive!

SOMERSET

The way this has gone, I didn't think it

was possible, but we may have

underestimated this guy.  The type of

intestinal fortitude it must take... to

keep a man bound for a full year.  To

sever his hand and use it to plant

fingerprints.

MILLS

I want him bad.  I don't just want to

catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.

SOMERSET

Listen... we have to divorce ourselves

from our emotions here.  We have to keep

focusing on the small details.

MILLS

I don't know about you, Somerset, but I

feed off my emotions.

SOMERSET

He'll string us along all the way if

we're not careful.

SOMERSET (CONT)

Are you listening to me?!

MILLS

I hear you.

JOHN

Say cheese.

MILLS

What the fuck are you doing?

JOHN

I have a right, Officer.  I...

MILLS

That doesn't mean anything.  This is a

closed crime scene now!

JOHN

You can't do this!  You can't...

MILLS

Get the fuck out of here!

JOHN (O.S.)

The public has a right to know!

MILLS

How do those cockroaches get here so

quick?

SOMERSET

They pay cops for the inside scoop, and

they pay well.  You can hate them, but

you better give them something, or

they'll make it all up.

MILLS

(calming)

I'm sorry... I just...

SOMERSET

Oh, it's alright.  It's always

impressive to see a man feeding off his

emotions.

BEARDSLEY

A year of immobility seems about right,

judging by the deterioration of the

muscles and spinal cord.  Blood tests

show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his

system.  Heroin... crack... even an

antibiotic which was administered to

keep the bed sores from infecting.

MILLS

He hasn't said anything, or tried to

express himself in any way?

BEARDSLEY

Even if his brain were not mush, which

it is... he chewed his own tongue off a

long time ago.

MILLS

There's no way he'll survive?

BEARDSLEY

Detective, he'd die right now of shock

if you were to shine a flashlight in his

eyes.

BLEEKER

Put them away.  I wish you hadn't

brought them into the church.

SOMERSET

I needed for you to see them.

BLEEKER

There were five principal phases in the

development of early Christian art.

From Hellenistic through the

Renaissance... each period was affected

by the decrees of religious leaders.

SOMERSET

If this killer belongs to a certain

branch of the church... if he collects

religious art from a certain period, I

want to know.  I have to narrow it down.

BLEEKER

The influences on these... things he's

done, couldn't have come before the

Gothic period.  What's in those pictures

is presented far too asymmetrically.

BLEEKER (CONT)

The colors will tell the tale.

BLEEKER (CONT)

Each sin had a symbolic color.  But the

specific color designations changed

throughout the ages.

BLEEKER (O.S.,CONT)

This is an example.  Gluttony is the

sin, and the color is orange.  This

particular manuscript is preserved from

the 18th century.

SOMERSET (O.S.)

In the murders, gluttony is green.

Greed is yellow.  Sloth is indigo.

BLEEKER

So, if this murderer is as precise as

you say, then you need to find out at

what period in history was gluttony

green... and so on.

SOMERSET

Where do I look?  If the colors changed

so often?

BLEEKER

(contemplates)

There is one man... Father Stone.

(pause)

I haven't heard from him for quite some

time.  This was his passion.  He spent

his life studying the sins... and

preaching against them.

OFFICER

Zero's landlord said an envelope of cash

was in the office mailbox each month.

He says, quote, "I never heard a single

complaint from this guy and nobody ever

complained about him.  He's the best

tenant I ever had."

MILLS

There's a landlord's dream tenant.  A

paralyzed man with no tongue.

OFFICER

Who pays his rent on time.

MILLS

Bring me everything as soon as it's

transcribed.

Dear Detectives,

Long is the way, and hard, that out

of hell leads up to the light.

MILLS

(to himself)

Milton.

BLEEKER

Father Stone had a church and

congregation of his own.  But, he...

there were some problems.  The church is

deserted now.

SOMERSET

Problems?

SOMERSET (CONT)

Father?

BLEEKER

There was a small orphanage attached to

the church, overseen by Father Stone.

This was almost thirty years ago.

(hesitant)

He was an excellent priest, devoted in

every way.  Many in his parish demanded

his return.

SOMERSET

Tell me what happened.

BLEEKER

Allegations were made... Stone was

accused of abusing the children in his

care.  But, those charges were

never

substantiated.

SOMERSET

What abuse?

BLEEKER

It was claimed... that the children were

beaten.  And, punished severely.

SOMERSET

Father Stone.  I'm a policeman.  I'd

like to ask you a few questions, if it's

alright?

SOMERSET (CONT)

I want to ask you about the seven deadly

sins.

STONE

The sins.

SOMERSET

Yes, father.

STONE

Are you one of mine?

SOMERSET

I don't...

STONE

Are you saved?  Do you have God?

SOMERSET

I... I need to ask about the sins.  Do

you understand what I'm saying?

STONE

Are you a sinner?

STONE (CONT)

There are sinners here.  Even here.

And, pain waits for them.  Hell is

hungry for them.

STONE (CONT)

They don't realize... they don't know.

(pause)

Fuck them all!

NUN

(to Somerset)

They shouldn't have let you disturb him.

This shouldn't have been allowed.

STONE

Where are the children?

(much louder)

Where are the children?!

BLEEKER

What are you looking for?

SOMERSET

I'm just looking.

BLEEKER

Saint Jerome Emiliani.  The patron saint

of orphans.

SOMERSET

Is this still the Lord's house?

BLEEKER

Of course it is.

SOMERSET

And, even if Father Stone was guilty of

everything... if he was hurting children

here?  It's still the Lord's house?

BLEEKER

You have

no

faith, Somerset?  Have you

given up on the church entirely?

SOMERSET

No.

(pause)

That's not what I've given up on.

MILLS

Our guy's a bookworm, right?  And, I

know it's a long shot, but you have to

give a picture id and current phone bill

to get a library card.  Hey...

MILLS (CONT)

I made two separate lists of books.  One

relating to the sins... Dante's

Purgatory, Canterbury Tales... The

Dictionary of Catholicism... all the

religious stuff.  The second list was

books about torture methods, mass

murderers... sadomasochism.  Whatever

our killer might study to do the things

he's done.  Whatever his other interests

are.

SOMERSET

So, what is this?

MILLS

Alright.  Everything at the library goes

into a computer.  So, you can get in the

system and cross-reference...

MILLS (CONT)

Let's say you take, Dante's Purgatory,

call number eight-five-one-D, and... The

Biography of the Marquis de Sade,

ninety-two S-A-D-E.  Put those books in

the system, and the computer can give

you the name of anyone who's ever taken

out both those books.  And, it doesn't

just give you their name and address, it

gives you a complete history of their

library reading habits.

MILLS (CONT)

(psyched up)

If somebody's out there reading Paradise

Lost and studying The Life and Times of

Charlie Manson, I want to talk to them.

SOMERSET

Dario!  Come here.

SOMERSET (CONT)

According to the Father, this orphanage

wasn't around for more than five or six

years in the late fifties.  So, I want

someone to go to the Department of Child

Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the

records on this place.  Understand?

DARIO

I got it.

SOMERSET

Get a list of every child who attended

this orphanage before it shut down.  Get

it on my desk within the hour.

SOMERSET (CONT)

You thought of this all by yourself?

This was your brainstorm?

MILLS

Yeah.  Is that so hard for you to

believe?

SOMERSET

It's a pleasant surprise.

MILLS

I'm not as stupid as I look.

SOMERSET

(to himself)

I guess not.

MILLS (O.S.)

Ramirez.  Manuel Ramirez.

SOMERSET (O.S.)

No... I don't see any Ramirez.

MILLS (O.S.)

Elinski.  Dennis Elinski.

SOMERSET (O.S.)

No.

MILLS (O.S.)

Atwater?  Paul Atwater.

SOMERSET (O.S.)

No.

MILLS

Okay, here we go.  Listen to the books

this guy's been taking out...

(reading list)

Basic Homicide Investigation.  Forensic

Toxicology... The Encyclopedia of Modern

Serial Killers...

(looks up, excited)

Of

Human Bondage

.

SOMERSET

That's not what you think it is.

MILLS

Holy shit.  Somerset...

(reading list)

The Writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas.

MILLS (CONT)

Aquinas.  Right?

SOMERSET

That's right.  Let me have it.

MILLS

Fuck... he used a false name.

SOMERSET

How do you know?

MILLS

His library card lists him as Jonathan

Doe.  John Doe.

MILLS (CONT)

What?

SOMERSET

Christ... it's like a sick joke.

MILLS

What are you talking about?

SOMERSET

There is one boy here.  He was

abandoned... no one knew who his

parents were, so he was named at the

orphanage...

(looks at Mills)

John Doe.  It's his legal name.

MILLS

It's impossible odds that this is him.

SOMERSET

We're focusing.

MILLS

I know, I know.  On one little thing.

I'm not complaining.  I'll follow

anything we get and I'll take it any way

we can get it.

SOMERSET

We'll look at him.  Ask a few questions.

Try to get a feeling whether we should

keep tabs on him.

MILLS

(quietly)

I'll do the talking, right?  Let me

practice here... um, excuse me Mr. Doe,

but, are you by any chance a serial

killer?  Oh... oh, you are?  Well, come

with us then, if you don't mind.

MILLS (CONT)

Somerset!

MILLS (CONT)

It's him!  Jesus Christ, we can get this

fucker!

MILLS

Are you alright?  Are you okay?

SOMERSET

Yeah.  I think so.

ONE FORENSIC

I hear he's running around with an uzi

in one hand and a book of poetry in the

other.

COP

A real, modern-day renaissance man, huh?

MILLS

(to forensics)

Give us first crack at it.

SOMERSET

Jesus Christ.

MILLS (O.S.)

Somerset!

MILLS (O.S.)

Somerset, we had him.  Goddamn it.

MILLS (CONT)

The pass is a fake... we had him.

MILLS (CONT)

We were that close to him.

SOMERSET

I know.

SKETCH ARTIST

This is the guy?

MILLS

Make sure it gets around.

SKETCH ARTIST

You got it.  Tomorrow morning, this

city's good citizens will be on the

lookout for Elmer Fudd.

SARAH

(to Mills)

We can't find anything to hang onto.  No

pay-stubs, no appointment books or

calendars.  Not even a book of phone

numbers.  And, you're not going to

believe this...

MILLS

Keep looking.

SARA

It's just... we haven't found any

fingerprints yet.  Not one.

MILLS

You know, you're right.  I don't believe

it.  Keep looking.

SOMERSET

We need to put more men on this.

MILLS

I'm working on it, alright.  What have

we got.

SOMERSET

We've got about five thousand notebooks

in this room.  And, as near as I can

tell, each notebook contains two hundred

and fifty pages.

MILLS

Then, he must write about the murders.

SOMERSET

"What sick, silly puppets we are, and

what a gross stage we dance on.  What

fun we have, dancing around, not a care

in the world.  Not knowing that we are

nothing.  We are not what God intended."

(turns pages)

"On the subway today, a man came up to

start a conversation.  He was making

small talk, this lonely man, talking

about the weather and other things.  I

tried to be accommodating, but my head

began to hurt from his banality.  I

almost didn't notice it had happened,

but I threw up all over him.  And I

couldn't stop myself from laughing."

(closes book)

No dates indicated.  They're placed on

the shelves in no discernible order.  He

describes a scab on his arm for five

pages, then writes about existential

philosophy on the next.

SOMERSET (CONT)

It's just his mind poured out on paper.

MILLS

You were right.  He is preaching.

MILLS

(into phone)

Hello... hello?

JOHN DOE (V.O.)

(from recorder)

I admire you, David.  Imagine my

surprise on finding you at my doorstep.

I admire you more and more every day.

MILLS

(into phone)

Okay, John.  Let's...

JOHN DOE (V.O.)

(from recorder)

No, no, no!  You listen and don't talk.

I suppose you found the painting and the

photos.  This is just as well.  Now we

all know we've all seen each other.

(pause)

I mean what I say.  I do admire you.

JOHN DOE (V.O.,CONT)

Oh, there is one other thing.  Fourteen

hundred thirty.  West Eighty-sixth

street.  Apartment six-o-four.

MILLS

Pride.  Just like in the painting.

SOMERSET

You can see what he did.

MILLS

Cut her up... dressed the wounds.  He

put the noose around her neck and stood

her on the chair.

SOMERSET

She had the telephone.

MILLS

Call for help, and you'll live.  But,

you'll be mutilated.

SOMERSET

Or, kick out the chair, and spare

yourself a lifetime of hideousness.

O'NEILL

He cut off her nose to spite her face.

And he did it very recently.

CAPTAIN

Alright, boys, you're running on empty.

Go home.  Just make sure you sleep with

the phone between your knees.

SOMERSET

Tracy?

TRACY

Somerset.  How are you?

SOMERSET

I'm alright.  I'm glad to see you found

this place.  I almost should have

expected to run into you here, knowing

that you teach English.

TRACY

It's so huge.  It's amazing.

SOMERSET

This is why I moved into this

neighborhood.

TRACY

Don't you love the smell of all the old

books.  It smells like... like... I

guess just old books, but, I love it.

TRACY (CONT)

Forgive me.  No matter how often I see

guns, I can't get used to them.

SOMERSET

Same here.

TRACY

If David's going to be back home soon, I

should get back.

TRACY (CONT)

I hope you'll come to dinner another

night.  Before you leave.

SOMERSET

You can stay and browse a little longer,

can't you?  I mean...

SOMERSET (CONT)

I... I hardly know anyone I can talk

about books with anymore.  I'd

appreciate the company.

SOMERSET (O.S.)

The irony is, that after a day of the

type of work he did, he'd come home and

read me these morbid crime stories.  Le

Fanu's Green Tea.  Murders in the Rue

Morgue.

SOMERSET (CONT)

My mother would give him hell... because

I was young, and he was keeping me up

till all hours, giving me nightmares.

TRACY

Sounds like a father who wanted his son

to follow in his footsteps.

SOMERSET

One birthday, he gave me a hardcover

book called The Century of the

Detective, by Jurgen Thorwald.  It

traced the history of detection as a

science and it sealed my fate.  Because

it was real, and that a drop of blood or

a piece of hair could solve a crime...

was incredible to me.

CLERK (O.S.)

We're closing up, Somerset.

SOMERSET

Okay, thanks.

TRACY

David's going to wonder where I am.

SOMERSET

I'll give you a ride.

TRACY

No.  Please, don't bother.

SOMERSET

I have to insist.  If your husband found

out I let you ride the subway at this

hour he'd tear my head off.

SOMERSET (CONT)

I mean, literally.

TRACY

You've lived here for so long, Somerset.

You know this city.  I...

SOMERSET

It's a hard place, Tracy.

TRACY

When David and I lived in Philadelphia,

we could afford to live on the

outskirts.  But now...

(pause)

I hate it here.  I feel scared, and I

feel sick and... I hate it.

SOMERSET

You have to put blinders on sometimes.

Most times.  But, keep in mind, Tracy,

like tonight, there are small pockets of

sanity.  Some bars and bookstores.

Museums.  Several last vestiges of

civilization.

TRACY

I've visited so many of the schools,

looking for work, you know.  And, the

conditions are... horrible.  I can't

believe how bad it is.

(pause)

Children shouldn't have to grow up here.

SOMERSET

You can always look into the private

schools.  You'll find something.

SOMERSET (CONT)

You're too hard on yourself, Tracy.

SOMERSET (CONT)

It's okay to hate this city.  It's

natural.  But, there is a bright side in

all this.  There is.  You want to hear

it?

TRACY

Oh, God, yes.  Please.

SOMERSET

I can't think of another place that

needs education more than this city.

And you're a teacher.  You can make a

difference in a few people's lives.

It's a very good thing.

TRACY

Goodnight, Somerset.

SOMERSET

Goodnight.

SOMERSET (CONT)

I'm sorry, Tracy.  I'm sorry.

TRACY

I... I better go.

MILLS

It won't be for long, honey.  I swear.

This is just till this is over.

TRACY

I know.

MILLS

I'm sorry.

TRACY

I know.  It can't be helped.

2 greed (x)         6 envy

3 sloth (x)         7 wrath

4 pride (x)

MILLS

There's two people in that painting.

So, maybe he's planning to kill two

people this time.  Maybe.

MILLS (CONT)

What's wrong this morning?

SOMERSET

Nothing.  Sorry.

MILLS

Lust is next.  Lust is sex.

SOMERSET

Apples on the floor.  Original sin.

MILLS

Adam and Eve.

MILLS (CONT)

Sex, sex, sex.  Fucking sex.

SOMERSET

Lust is everywhere.  That's the hard

part.  I think lust is the most

prevalent sin, even more than greed.

MILLS

Lust is red.

SOMERSET

Bright red.

MILLS

Blood red.

SOMERSET

Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

MILLS

Red blooded.  Red head.  Dead.

SOMERSET

Red light district.

MILLS

That would make sense.

SOMERSET

It would be fitting.

MILLS

You're damn right it would.

WILD BILL (O.S.)

Yeah, he was here.  This morning.

MILLS

It was definitely him?  You're positive?

WILD BILL

Yeah.  John Doe.  Easy name to remember.

SOMERSET

What was this job you did for him?

WILD BILL

I got a picture of it.  That's what he

came for this morning.  I figured he

must be one of those art guys... like

those guys who piss in a cup and drink

it on stage.  Performance art.

MILLS

Oh, fuck...

WILD BILL

I think I undercharged him.  I was up

all night working to finish it.

SOMERSET

(looks at photo)

You built this for him?  You built this?

WILD BILL

I've built weirder shit than that.

POLICEMAN

Somerset... we have a situation.

WILD BILL

Hey, my picture!

WILD BILL (CONT)

Fucking pigs.

FAT MAN

Just wait!

COP

Get out of the fucking booth!

FAT MAN

Just wait!  I'll come out, just wait!

COP

I don't want to go in there again.

CRAZED MAN

He... he... he made me do it!

SECOND ATTENDANT

I have to look at you.  I have to look

at you.

FIRST ATTENDANT

You're not going to want to see this

more than once.

CRAZED MAN

He had a gun!  He... he made me do it!

CRAZED MAN (O.S.,CONT)

He made me do it!

CRAZED MAN

And... and... and he said... he asked if

I was married.  And, I could see he had

a gun in his hand.

SOMERSET

Where was the girl?

CRAZED MAN

What?  What?

SOMERSET

Where was the prostitute?

CRAZED MAN

She was... she was on the bed.  She was

just sitting on the bed.

SOMERSET

Who tied her down?  You or him?

CRAZED MAN

He had a gun.  He had a gun, and he made

it happen.  He made me do it!

He made me put it on... that thing.  Oh,

God... he made me wear it.  He had the

gun in my mouth.

CRAZED MAN (CONT)

The gun was in my throat.

SOMERSET

There's not going to be a happy ending.

It's not possible.

MILLS

If we get him, I'll be happy enough.

SOMERSET

No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's

good guys against the bad guys in this

city.

MILLS

How can you say that?  Especially after

today?

SOMERSET

You tell me... when you walk into an

apartment, and a man has beaten his wife

to death, or, a wife murdered her

husband in cold blood... and you have to

wash the blood off their children.  You

put the killer in jail.  Who won?

MILLS

If I thought like you, I'd have slit my

wrists a long time ago.

SOMERSET

Where's the victory?

MILLS

You do your job.  Follow the law and do

the best you can.  It's all there.

SOMERSET

If we caught John Doe tomorrow, and it

turned out he was the devil... if it

turned out he was literally Satan, then,

that might live up to our expectations.

No human being could do these horrible

things, right?!  But, this is not the

devil.  It's only a man.

MILLS

Why don't you shut the fuck up for a

while?!  Huh?  You make these

speeches... like you know everything

there is to know.

MILLS (CONT)

You think you're preparing me for the

hard times ahead?

You think you're toughening me up?

Well, you're not!

(pause)

You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying

to fight.

SOMERSET

Who are you fighting for?  People don't

want a champion.  They just want to keep

playing the lottery and eating

hamburgers.

MILLS

What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?

What burnt you out?

SOMERSET

There's no one thing, if that's what you

mean.  I just... I can't live anymore

where stupidity is embraced and nurtured

as if it were a virtue.

MILLS

You're so much better than everyone,

right?  No one's worthy of you.

SOMERSET

Wrong!  I sympathize completely.

Because if you can't win... then, if you

don't ignore everything and everyone

around you, you go insane.  It's easier

to smoke crack, and not worry that your

wife and kids are starving to death.

And, it's so much easier to bear a child

till that child finally shuts up,

because it takes so much work to love.

And, if you bothered to think about the

abuse, and the damage, you'd be sad.

MILLS

You're talking about people who are

mentally ill.  You're...

SOMERSET

(cuts in, furious)

No, I am not!  I'm talking about common,

everyday life here.  Where Ignorance

isn't bliss, it's a matter of survival.

MILLS

Listen to yourself.  You say, "the

problem with people is they don't care,

so I don't care about people."  But, if

you're not part of the solution...

SOMERSET

(cuts him off)

People who are in arguments over their

heads always use meaningless slogans.

But, life doesn't conform to analogies.

MILLS

You're already here, and you've been

here a long time.  So, there's a part of

you that knows, even if everything you

say is true, none of it matters.

SOMERSET

That part of me is dead.

MILLS

Fuck you.  You want me to agree with

you.  "Yeah, you're right, Somerset,

this place is fucked.  Let's go live in

a fucking log cabin!"  Well, I don't

agree with you.  You're quitting, and it

makes me sick.  Cause, you're the best

I've ever seen.

MILLS (CONT)

Thanks for the beer.

TRACY

David?

MILLS

I love you.

TRACY

David?

MILLS

I love you.

SOMERSET

(into phone)

Hello.

TRACY (V.O.)

(from phone, upset)

Hello, Somerset.  It's Tracy.

SOMERSET

Is everything alright?

TRACY (V.O.)

Yes.  Everything's fine.  Could... could

you meet me somewhere.  To talk.

SOMERSET

(pause)

I don't think that's a good idea.

TRACY (V.O.)

I need to talk to someone, Somerset.

You're the only friend I have here.  I

don't know anyone else.

SOMERSET

David doesn't know about this?  You

haven't told him?

SOMERSET (CONT)

I have to tell you, Tracy, I'm not the

one to talk to about this.

TRACY

I just can't think straight.  I don't

know why I called you, except I can't

stand to hold it as a secret anymore.  I

had to get it out... and I can't tell

David yet.  Not yet.

SOMERSET

I... I had a relationship once, very

much like a marriage.  And, there was a

baby.  A long time ago.  Things were

good.  And I got up one morning, and I

went on a case... a murder, like any

other.  Except it was my first since

hearing about the baby.  And, I felt

this fear and anxiety coming over me.  I

looked around and I thought, how can I

raise a child here?  So, that night, I

told her I didn't want us to have

children,  And, over the next few

weeks... I convinced her...

SOMERSET (CONT)

I mean, I wore her down... slowly.

TRACY

I want to have children.  But...

SOMERSET

I can tell you, I know... I'm positive I

made the right decision.  I'm positive

it was the right thing to do.  But,

there's never a day that goes by that I

don't wish I had decided differently.

SOMERSET (CONT)

If you... if you decide not to have the

baby... if that's what you decide, then

never tell Mills you were pregnant.

I mean that.  Never tell.

(pause)

Your marriage would just wither, and die

altogether.

SOMERSET (CONT)

But, if you decide to have the baby,

then, at that very instant, when you're

absolutely sure... tell him.  Tell him

that exact second.  And, spoil that kid

every chance you get.

TRACY

Somerset...

SOMERSET

That's all the wisdom I can share with

you, Tracy.  I barely know you.

TRACY

Will I see you again, before you leave?

SOMERSET

Probably not.  But, it's probably better

that way.

SOMERSET

I've decided... I want to stay on, till

this is over.  Till either it's done, or

we can see it will never end.

MILLS

Oh, you want to stay now?

SOMERSET

One of two things is going to happen.

We're either going to get John Doe...

or, he will finish his series of seven,

and he'll never be found.

MILLS

You think if you stay you're doing me

some big favor?

SOMERSET

I'm requesting you keep me on as your

partner a few more days.  You'd be doing

me the favor.

MILLS

You knew I'd say yes.

SOMERSET

No.  I wasn't sure at all.

SOMERSET

As soon as this is over, I'll be gone.

MILLS

What a great big surprise that is.

MILLS (CONT)

Mills and Somerset are on the premises.

SERGEANT

Wonder-fucking-ful.

UNIFORMED COP

It's him!

MILLS

Get down on the floor.

SOMERSET

Be careful!

ANOTHER COP

You heard him!  Get on the floor!

ONE COP

Spread your legs and get your hands out

in front of you.

MILLS

Get down!  Face down!

MILLS (CONT)

Don't move.  Don't move a fucking inch.

SOMERSET

I don't believe it.

JOHN DOE

Hello, Lieutenant Somerset.

COP

What the hell is this?

JOHN DOE

I want to speak with my lawyer.

CAPTAIN

He cuts off the skin of his fingertips.

That's why we can't find a single usable

print in his apartment.  For a long

time, he's been cutting before the

papillary lines can grow back.

MILLS

What about the trace on his bank

account?  The guns?

CAPTAIN

The orphanage is all we have.  His bank

account is only five years old and it

started as cash.  There's no credit

history, no employment history.  We even

tried to trace his furniture.  All we

know for sure is he's wealthy, well

educated and totally insane.  We may

never know how he got that way.

SOMERSET

Because he is John Doe, by choice.

MILLS

When do we get to question him?

CAPTAIN

You don't.  This goes to court now.

MILLS

This doesn't make sense, captain.  He

wouldn't just turn himself in!

CAPTAIN

Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed

to make sense.

MILLS

He's not finished!

CAPTAIN

You're wound way too tight on this,

Mills.

MILLS

Somerset... help me out here.

CAPTAIN

It's over.

MILLS

Damn it, Somerset.  You know Johnny's

fucking with us.  He's pissing in our

faces again!

SOMERSET

Slow up.  You and I are, probably for

the first time ever, in total agreement.

He wouldn't just stop.

MILLS

Well... what the fuck, man?

SOMERSET

John Doe's only two murders away from

finishing his masterpiece, right?  But,

can you even conceive of what might

happen next?  I mean, can you tell me

how he's going to go about it?

MILLS

(pause)

No.

SOMERSET

I can tell you this; I recognize his

lawyer.  His name is Mark Swarr.  He's

the one who kept Zero out of prison.

(pause)

We'll wait for John Doe's plea.

1 gluttony (x)       5 lust (x)

2 greed (x)          6 wrath

3 sloth (x)          7 envy

4 pride (x)

SWARR

My client says there are two more

bodies... two more dead, hidden away.

He will take Detective Mills to these

bodies, but only Detective Mills.  Only

at six o'clock, today.

TALBOT

Oh, Christ.

MILLS

Why me?

SWARR

He says he admires you.

SOMERSET

(to captain)

This is all part of his game plan.

SWARR

Mr. Doe claims that if the detective

does not accept this offer, the bodies

will never be found.

CAPTAIN

Frankly, counselor, I'm inclined to let

them rot.

MILLS

You like what you do for a living?

CAPTAIN

Back off, Mills.

SWARR

I'm required by law to serve my clients

to the best of my ability, and to serve

their interests.

TALBOT

We don't make deals like this.

CAPTAIN

We're going to have to pass.

SWARR

My client... he also wishes that I

inform you, if you do not accept, he

will plead insanity, across the board.

TALBOT

Let him try.  I'd like to see him try!

SWARR

Come now, Martin.  Even he knows, with

the nature of these crimes, I could get

him off with such a plea.

TALBOT

I'm not letting this conviction slide.

I can tell you that, right here and

right now!

SWARR

He says, if you accept, under his

specific conditions, he will sign a full

confession and plead guilty... right

here, and right now.

MILLS

I'll do it.

SOMERSET

Hold on... just a minute.

SOMERSET (CONT)

If he were to plead insanity... this

conversation is admissible.  The fact

that he's blackmailing us with his

plea...

SWARR

And, my client reminds you, two more

people are dead.  The press would have a

field day if they found out the police

didn't seem too concerned about finding

them... giving them proper burial.

MILLS

I'll do it.  I want to finish it.

SOMERSET

(to captain)

Well... let's get the fucking lawyer out

of the room, and we can talk about how

this whole thing's going to go down.

SOMERSET

If John Doe's head splits open, and a

U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have

expected it.

MILLS

I will.

SOMERSET

No emotion.  Stay as cold as ice.

MILLS

I will.

MILLS (CONT)

(very serious)

Listen, Somerset... we've been through a

lot together.  And, I uh...

SOMERSET

What is it?

MILLS

I would like to make sweet love to you.

SOMERSET

Please...

MILLS

Give me a kiss on the lips.

SOMERSET

Give me a break.

SOMERSET

Ready?

MILLS

Extremely.

CALIFORNIA

Is this wind going to hurt us?

PILOT

Just makes the ride a little more fun.

MILLS

What's your story, Johnny?  Who are you,

really?

JOHN DOE

It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am

means absolutely nothing.

MILLS (V.O.)

(from receiver)

What's your deal?  You seem pretty

fucking nervous.

JOHN DOE (V.O.)

(from receiver)

I want this to go well.  It's very

important to me, obviously.

MILLS (V.O.)

(from headset)

You want this to go well?  What is this?

JOHN DOE (V.O.)

(from headset)

Turn right on this street.  Stay in the

left lane.

SOMERSET

I'm here.

CALIFORNIA (V.O.)

(from headset)

Downtown and moving west.  Looks like

you're going to be crossing water.

SOMERSET

If we're on the bridge, you keep your

distance.  You hear me?

SOMERSET (V.O.)

(from headset)

Cross the river before us if necessary.

CALIFORNIA

You got it.

MILLS (V.O.)

(from receiver)

For us to go pick up two more dead

bodies, and have that be the end of

it... just seems too boring for you.

MILLS

Wouldn't be sensational enough.

JOHN DOE

Wanting people to pay attention, you

can't just tap them on the shoulder.

JOHN DOE (CONT)

Sometimes you have to hit them in the

head with a sledgehammer... and then you

get their strict attention.

MILLS

What are you looking at, Johnny?

JOHN DOE

Looking back... at the city proper...

JOHN DOE (CONT)

And yet, no pillar of salt.

(smiles to himself)

Lost on you, isn't it?  You've never

read the Bible, have you, David?

MILLS

I remember a lot of people reading it

at

me when I was a kid.  I preferred the

classic comic version myself.

MILLS (CONT)

I used to have "Godspell" on an eight-

track tape.  Does that count?

JOHN DOE

You make me sick.

MILLS

Sit back, freak.

JOHN DOE

(under his breath)

Ignorant heathen.

MILLS

Right, right.  I forgot.  You think

these murders were for God.  Right?

(pause)

I'm asking you seriously.  You really

think what you did was God's good work?

JOHN DOE

The Lord works in mysterious ways.

CALIFORNIA (O.S.)

Fuck, man... there's about a thousand

places to be ambushed out here.

CALIFORNIA (V.O.)

(from headset)

I don't see anything... not yet.

SOMERSET

(in mouthpiece)

A quick sweep is all we get.  Clear out

now.  You're right in front of us.

MILLS

Jesus Christ, Superstar... who in the

world do you think you are?  Jesus

Christ, Superstar...

JOHN DOE (V.O.)

(from receiver)

We can walk from here.

SOMERSET

(in mouthpiece)

You stay out of this unless I call you

in, California.  Understand?

CALIFORNIA (V.O.)

(from headset)

You're in charge.

MILLS (V.O.)

(from receiver)

Alright, Somerset.  Going for a stroll.

MILLS

Lean on your side.  Hands behind your

head and lock your fingers together.

MILLS (V.O.)

(from receiver)

Where are we going?

MILLS (V.O.,CONT)

(from receiver)

Lead the way.

JOHN DOE

It's right this way.

MILLS

So far, so good.

JOHN DOE

In here.

MILLS

You go first.

MILLS (CONT)

Tell me where we're going.

MILLS (V.O.)

(from receiver)

Slow down, Johnny.  Stop right there.

(pause)

I said stop!

MILLS

I'll blow your head off right now!

MILLS (CONT)

What...

MILLS (CONT)

No!

MILLS (V.O.)

(from receiver)

Motherfucker!  No!

open manhole cover

Doe disappeared into.

MILLS

He's gone, Somerset!  He's in the water!

MILLS (V.O.)

(from receiver)

I'm going in!

MILLS (V.O.)

(from headset)

I have to go in after him!

CALIFORNIA

Somerset, what's going on down there?!

MILLS

Come on, Johnny!  I'm right here!

SOMERSET

Mills!

CALIFORNIA

God damn it!  Let's do something!

PILOT

Somerset said wait!

CALIFORNIA

Fuck that!  Let's go!

PILOT

Where?

CALIFORNIA

I don't know!  Just go!

MILLS

Come on!  Let's do it!  You and me!

MILLS (CONT)

I'm not going to let you win this!

SOMERSET

Christ.

SOMERSET

Mills!  Pull out!

SOMERSET (CONT)

(pleading)

Pull out now!

JOHN DOE (O.S.)

Hello, Somerset.

SOMERSET

Where's David?

JOHN DOE (O.S.)

He's here.  With me.

SOMERSET

Tell me what you want.

JOHN DOE

What do I want?  The same you... I want

an ending.  Stay where you are.  Put

your gun on the floor and slide it all

the way down here.

SOMERSET

I want to see him.  Show me Mills.

JOHN DOE

You're an intelligent man, Somerset.

You understand what you're a part of,

don't you?  When this is finished, it

will seem surreal, but it will be a

whole, crystalline reality.  And, no one

will be able to deny it, no matter how

hard they try.

SOMERSET

You're a murderer.  That's all.  The

only way you've distinguished yourself

is by your particular brutality.

JOHN DOE

You know that's not true.  You know.

SOMERSET

You're killing innocent people, and I

should admire you?  You're doing it

because it gives you pleasure.  That's

the only purpose... your sick pleasure.

JOHN DOE

Stay where you are!

JOHN DOE (CONT)

I won't deny my personal desires.  I

won't.

JOHN DOE (CONT)

But, I don't mourn the victims in this

any more than I mourn the

thousands

who

died in Sodom and Gomorrah.

SOMERSET

All you've done is cause more misery and

pain!  You've given people all the more

reason to believe there is no God!

JOHN DOE

Stop!

MILLS

Somerset?

SOMERSET

Do you really think I'm just going to

let this happen?!  You think I'm going

to let him die?

JOHN DOE

Yes.

MILLS

Motherfucker!

JOHN DOE

How can you speak of God, Somerset?

When was the last time you spoke His

name?

JOHN DOE (CONT)

When did you last speak His name?  Was

it in prayer?  Or, did you say the

Lord's name after you stubbed your big

toe?  Or, did you use His name to curse

another man?

MILLS

I'm going to kill you, Johnny.  I'm

going to see you dead.

JOHN DOE

The irony, David, is that you policemen

and I want the same things.  But, you

are so short sighted.  In this city,

where you can see a deadly sin on every

street corner... and in every home, we

want repentance.

JOHN DOE (CONT)

We want good over evil.  We want values

instilled in the children.  We want a

world where a man or woman can lead a

decent life.

(pause)

Wisdom, understanding, counsel,

fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of

the Lord.  Such simple concepts.  Why

are they non-existent?

SOMERSET

(weakly)

Let him go, God damn you.

JOHN DOE

There were two men once, who had

wonderful gardens.  Two gardens of

flowers that went on as far as the eye

could see.  Beautiful gardens... the

fragrance was inspiration in itself.

JOHN DOE (CONT)

But, both gardens were beset by

problems.  Weeds started to take root,

and there were infestations of insects

and diseases.  The gardens started to

turn putrid.  And, one man fought to

save his garden, because he could never

forget how it once was.  Everyday he cut

the weeds, and killed the insects.

Fought the diseases.

JOHN DOE (CONT)

That man never had a beautiful garden

again.

MILLS

Fuck you!

JOHN DOE

The other man plowed his garden under.

(pause)

He plowed it under the soil.  He started

over.

JOHN DOE (CONT)

Stay there, Somerset.  Or, I'll kill him

right now.

SOMERSET

Alright... you don't have to do this,

John.  You've already made your point.

JOHN DOE

Do you think I chose this?  Can you even

begin to understand how painful my

existence has been?  It's like... like

having every sense heightened beyond

comprehension.

JOHN DOE (CONT)

So that the stench of the street coats

your throat like bile.  So, sugar is so

sweet it... it makes your bones ache to

the marrow.

SOMERSET

You're insane.  That's why.

JOHN DOE

(seething)

No!  You're wrong!

JOHN DOE (CONT)

I was chosen.  And I've wished a

thousand times I could have been a

normal man.  Like David Mills, a common

man... with a common life.  But, wishing

that is my sin.  I can't have it and I

shouldn't.

SOMERSET

Don't do this!

JOHN DOE

I meant what I said.  I admire David

Mills.  I envy David Mills.

(pause)

Envy is my sin.

SOMERSET

No!

SOMERSET (CONT)

David, get out!

SOMERSET (CONT)

No!

SOMERSET (CONT)

David... David?  Please...

SOMERSET (CONT)

You.

CAPTAIN

I don't know if I should do this.

(pause)

We found the motel room Doe must have

been staying in after you found his

apartment.

CAPTAIN (CONT)

Anyway... we found this in his

belongings.

SOMERSET

I wish I could say something...

(pause)

Something to... I don't know...

TRACY

I'll be okay.

SOMERSET

We'll keep in touch.  I'll come visit.

TRACY

I'll write to you when we get there.

SOMERSET

Take care of yourself.

(pause)

Take care of the baby.

MOVER

That's all, Mrs. Mills.  We got

everything.

SOMERSET

Goodbye, Tracy.

TRACY

Goodbye, Somerset.

SOMERSET

(to himself)

Oh... man...

PLOW THEM UNDER.
