THE BIG LEBOWSKI

VOICE-OVER

A way out west there was a fella,

fella I want to tell you about, fella

by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At

least, that was the handle his lovin'

parents gave him, but he never had

much use for it himself.  This

Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.

Now, Dude, that's a name no one would

self-apply where I come from.  But

then, there was a lot about the Dude

that didn't make a whole lot of sense

to me.  And a lot about where he

lived, like- wise.  But then again,

maybe that's why I found the place

s'durned innarestin'.

VOICE-OVER

They call Los Angeles the City of

Angels.  I didn't find it to be that

exactly, but I'll allow as there are

some nice folks there.  'Course, I

can't say I seen London, and I never

been to France, and I ain't never

seen no queen in her damn undies as

the fella says.  But I'll tell you

what, after seeing Los Angeles and

thisahere story I'm about to unfold--

wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever'

bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any

a those other places, and in English

too, so I can die with a smile on my

face without feelin' like the good

Lord gypped me.

VOICE-OVER

Now this story I'm about to unfold

took place back in the early nineties--

just about the time of our conflict

with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I

only mention it 'cause some- times

there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro,

'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes

there's a man.

VOICE-OVER

And I'm talkin' about the Dude here--

sometimes there's a man who, wal,

he's the man for his time'n place,

he fits right in there--and that's

the Dude, in Los Angeles.

GEORGE BUSH

This aggression will not stand. . .

This will not stand!

VOICE-OVER

...and even if he's a lazy man, and

the Dude was certainly that--quite

possibly the laziest in Los Angeles

County.

VOICE-OVER

...which would place him high in the

runnin' for laziest worldwide--but

sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes

there's a man.

VOICE-OVER

Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.

But--aw hell, I done innerduced him

enough.

DUDE

It's the LeBaron.

VOICE

We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny

said you were good for it.

VOICE

Where's the money, Lebowski!

VOICE

Where's the money, Lebowski!

VOICE

WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!

DUDE

It's uh, it's down there somewhere.

Lemme take another look.

VOICE

Don't fuck with us.  If your wife

owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that

means you owe money to Jackie

Treehorn.

CHINESE MAN

Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

DUDE

Oh, man.  Don't do--

BLOND MAN

You see what happens?  You see what

happens, Lebowski?

DUDE

Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You

got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude,

man.

BLOND MAN

Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is

Bunny.

DUDE

Bunny?  Look, moron.

DUDE

You see a wedding ring?  Does this

place look like I'm fucking married?

All my plants are dead!

BLOND MAN

The fuck is this?

DUDE

Obviously you're not a golfer.

BLOND MAN

Woo?

WOO

Yeah?

BLOND MAN

Wasn't this guy supposed to be a

millionaire?

WOO

Uh?

WOO

Fuck.

BLOND MAN

What do you think?

WOO

He looks like a fuckin' loser.

DUDE

Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.

WOO

Fuckin' waste of time.

BLOND MAN

Thanks a lot, asshole.

ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:

MAN

Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.

Mark it, Dude.

WALTER

This was a valued rug.

WALTER

This was, uh--

DUDE

Yeah man, it really tied the room

together--

WALTER

This was a valued, uh.

DONNY

What tied the room together, Dude?

WALTER

Were you listening to the story,

Donny?

DONNY

What--

WALTER

Were you listening to the Dude's

story?

DONNY

I was bowling--

WALTER

So you have no frame of reference,

Donny.  You're like a child who

wanders in in the middle of a movie

and wants to know--

DUDE

What's your point, Walter?

WALTER

There's no fucking reason--here's my

point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

DONNY

Yeah Walter, what's your point?

WALTER

Huh?

DUDE

What's the point of--we all know who

was at fault, so what the fuck are

you talking about?

WALTER

Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you

talking--I'm not--we're talking about

unchecked aggression here--

DONNY

What the fuck is he talking about?

DUDE

My rug.

WALTER

Forget it, Donny.  You're out of

your element.

DUDE

This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I

can't go give him a bill so what the

fuck are you talking about?

WALTER

What the fuck are you talking about?!

This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm

talking about drawing a line in the

sand, Dude.  Across this line you do

not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is

not the preferred, uh. . . Asian-

American.  Please.

DUDE

Walter, this is not a guy who built

the rail- roads, here, this is a guy

who peed on my--

WALTER

What the fuck are you--

DUDE

Walter, he peed on my rug--

DONNY

He peed on the Dude's rug--

WALTER

YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This

Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

DUDE

So who--

WALTER

Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other

Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.

He's gonna be easier to find anyway

than these two, uh. these two  . . .

And he has the wealth, uh, the

resources obviously, and there is no

reason, no FUCKING reason, why his

wife should go out and owe money and

they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

DUDE

No, but--

WALTER

Am I wrong!

DUDE

Yeah, but--

WALTER

Okay. That, uh.

DUDE

Fuckin' A.

DONNY

And this guy peed on it.

WALTER

Donny!  Please!

DUDE

Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

DONNY

His name is Lebowski?  That's your

name, Dude!

DUDE

Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should

compensate me for the fucking rug.

I mean his wife goes out and owes

money and they pee on my rug.

WALTER

Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on

your fucking Rug.

YOUNG MAN

And this is the study.  You can see

the various commendations, honorary

degrees, et cetera.

DUDE

Yes, uh, very impressive.

YOUNG MAN

Please, feel free to inspect them.

DUDE

I'm not really, uh.

YOUNG MAN

Please!  Please!

DUDE

Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN

That's the key to the city of

Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was

given two years ago in recognition

of his various civic, uh.

DUDE

Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN

That's a Los Angeles Chamber of

Commerce Business Achiever award,

which is given--not necessarily given

every year!  Given only when there's

a worthy, somebody especially--

DUDE

Hey, is this him with Nancy?

YOUNG MAN

That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the

first lady, yes, taken when--

DUDE

Lebowski on the right?

YOUNG MAN

Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right,

Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--

DUDE

He's handicapped, huh?

YOUNG MAN

Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And

this picture was taken when Mrs.

Reagan was first lady of the nation,

yes, yes? Not of California.

DUDE

Far out.

YOUNG MAN

And in fact he met privately with

the President, though unfortunately

there wasn't time for a photo

opportunity.

DUDE

Nancy's pretty good.

YOUNG MAN

Wonderful woman.  We were very--

DUDE

Are these.

YOUNG MAN

These are Mr. Lebowski's children,

so to speak--

DUDE

Different mothers, huh?

YOUNG MAN

No, they--

DUDE

I guess he's pretty, uh, racially

pretty cool--

YOUNG MAN

They're not his, heh-heh, they're

not literally his children; they're

the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,

inner-city children of promise but

without the--

DUDE

I see.

YOUNG MAN

--without  the means  for higher

education, so Mr. Lebowski  has

committed  to sending  all of them

to college.

DUDE

Jeez.  Think he's got room for one

more?

YOUNG MAN

One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went

to college?

DUDE

Well, yeah I did, but I spent most

of my time occupying various, um,

administration buildings--

YOUNG MAN

Heh-heh--

DUDE

--smoking thai-stick, breaking into

the ROTC--

YOUNG MAN

Yes, heh--

DUDE

--and bowling.  I'll tell you the

truth, Brandt, I don't remember most

of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

LEBOWSKI

Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a

Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very

busy so what can I do for you?

DUDE

Well sir, it's this rug I have, really

tied the room together-

LEBOWSKI

You told Brandt on the phone, he

told me.  So where do I fit in?

DUDE

Well they were looking for you, these

two guys, they were trying to--

LEBOWSKI

I'll say it again, all right?  You

told Brandt.  He told me.  I know

what happened. Yes?  Yes?

DUDE

So you know they were trying to piss

on your rug--

LEBOWSKI

Did I urinate on your rug?

DUDE

You mean, did you personally come

and pee on my--

LEBOWSKI

Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla

usted Inglese?  I'll say it again.

Did I urinate on your rug?

DUDE

Well no, like I said, Woo peed on

the rug--

LEBOWSKI

Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I

just want to understand this, sir--

every time a rug is micturated upon

in this fair city, I have to

compensate the--

DUDE

Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam

anybody here, I'm just--

LEBOWSKI

You're just looking for a handout

like every other--are you employed,

Mr. Lebowski?

DUDE

Look, let me explain something.

I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr.

Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's

what  you  call me.  That, or Duder.

His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,

you know, you're not into the whole

brevity thing--

LEBOWSKI

Are you employed, sir?

DUDE

Employed?

LEBOWSKI

You don't go out and make a living

dressed like that in the middle of a

weekday.

DUDE

Is this a--what day is this?

LEBOWSKI

But I do work, so if you don't mind--

DUDE

No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.

This will not stand, ya know, this

will not stand, man.  I mean, if

your wife owes--

LEBOWSKI

My wife is not the issue here. I

hope that my wife will someday learn

to live on her allowance, which is

ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that

will be her problem, not mine, just

as your rug is your problem, just as

every bum's lot in life is his own

responsibility regardless of whom he

chooses to blame.  I didn't blame

anyone for the loss of my legs, some

chinaman in Korea took them from me

but I went out and achieved anyway.

I can't solve your problems, sir,

only you can.

DUDE

Ah fuck it.

LEBOWSKI

Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!

Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your

answer to everything!

LEBOWSKI

Your "revolution" is over, Mr.

Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums

lost!

LEBOWSKI

...My advice is, do what your parents

did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will

always lose-- do you hear me,

Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--

HALLWAY

--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt

is approaching.

BRANDT

How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

DUDE

Okay.  The old man told me to take

any rug in the house.

BRANDT

Manolo will load it into your car

for you, uh, Dude.

DUDE

It's the LeBaron.

BRANDT

Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see

you again some time, Dude.

DUDE

Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the

neighborhood, need to use the john.

YOUNG WOMAN

Blow on them.

DUDE

Huh?

YOUNG WOMAN

G'ahead.  Blow.

DUDE

You want me to blow on your toes?

YOUNG WOMAN

Uh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.

DUDE

You sure he won't mind?

YOUNG WOMAN

Dieter doesn't care about anything.

He's a nihilist.

DUDE

Practicing?

YOUNG WOMAN

You're not blowing.

BRANDT

Our guest has to be getting along,

Mrs.  Lebowski.

DUDE

You're Bunny?

BUNNY

I'll suck your cock for a thousand

dollars.

BRANDT

Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very

free-spirited.  We're all very fond

of her.

BUNNY

Brandt can't watch though.  Or he

has to pay a hundred.

BRANDT

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.

DUDE

I'm just gonna find a cash machine.

DONNY

Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in

the water!!

DUDE

Your maples, Carl.

WALTER

Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it

is no dream.

DUDE

You're fucking twenty minutes late.

What the fuck is that?

WALTER

Theodore Herzel.

DUDE

Huh?

WALTER

State of Israel.  If you will it,

Dude, it is no--

DUDE

What the fuck're you talking about?

The carrier.  What's in the fucking

carrier?

WALTER

Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.

Can't leave him home alone or he

eats the furniture.

DUDE

What the fuck are you--

WALTER

I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.

I'm looking after it while Cynthia

and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

DUDE

You brought a fucking Pomeranian

bowling?

WALTER

What do you mean "brought it bowling"?

I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not

buying it a fucking beer.  He's not

gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

DUDE

Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked

me to take care of her fucking dog

while she and her boyfriend went to

Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck

herself.  Why can't she board it?

WALTER

First of all, Dude, you don't have

an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show

dog with fucking papers.  You can't

board it.  It gets upset, its hair

falls out.

DUDE

Hey man--

WALTER

Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over

the line!

WALTER

Smokey Huh?

WALTER

Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.

That's a foul.

SMOKEY

Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.

WALTER

Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.

SMOKEY

Bullshit. Walter!

WALTER

This is not Nam.  This is bowling.

There are rules.

DUDE

Come on Walter, it's just--it's

Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a

little, it's just a game.

WALTER

This is a league game.  This

determines who enters the next round-

robin, am I wrong?

SMOKEY

Yeah, but--

WALTER

Am I wrong!?

SMOKEY

Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the

marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an

eight.

WALTER

Smokey my friend, you're entering a

world of pain.

DUDE

Hey Walter--

WALTER

Mark that frame an eight, you're

entering a world of pain.

SMOKEY

I'm not--

WALTER

A world of pain.

SMOKEY

Look Dude, I don't hold with this.

This guy is your partner, you should--

WALTER

HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM

I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT

ABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO!

DUDE

Walter, they're calling the cops,

put the piece away.

WALTER

MARK IT ZERO!

SMOKEY

Walter--

WALTER

YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?

MARK IT ZERO!!

SMOKEY

All right!  There it is!  It's fucking

zero!

SMOKEY

You happy, you crazy fuck?

WALTER

This is a league game, Smokey!

DUDE

Walter, you can't do that.  These

guys're like me, they're pacificists.

Smokey was a conscientious objector.

WALTER

You know Dude, I myself dabbled with

pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam,

of course--

DUDE

And you know Smokey has emotional

problems!

WALTER

You mean--beyond pacifism?

DUDE

He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

WALTER

Huh.  I did not know that.  Well,

it's water under the bridge.  And we

do enter the next round-robin, am I

wrong?

DUDE

No, you're not wrong--

WALTER

Am I wrong!

DUDE

You're not wrong, Walter, you're

just an asshole.

WALTER

Okay then.  We play Quintana and

O'Brien next week.  They'll be

pushovers.

DUDE

Just, just take it easy, Walter.

WALTER

That's your answer to everything,

Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism

is not--look at our current situation

with that camelfucker in Iraq--

pacifism is not something to hide

behind.

DUDE

Well, just take 't easy, man.

WALTER

I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

DUDE

Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

WALTER

(smugly)

Calmer than you are.

DUDE

Just take it easy, man!

WALTER

Calmer than you are.

VOICE

Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't

wanna be a hard-on about this, and I

know it wasn't your fault, but I

just thought it was fair to tell you

that Gene and I will be submitting

this to the League and asking them

to set aside the round.  Or maybe

forfeit it to us--

DUDE

Shit!

VOICE

--so, like I say, just thought, you

know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.

ANOTHER VOICE

Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh,

well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.

Please call us as soon as is

convenient.

ANOTHER VOICE

Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski

with the Southern Cal Bowling League.

I just got a, an informal report,

uh, that a uh, a member of your team,

uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded

weapon during league play--

DUDE

Hiya Allan.

ALLAN

Dude, I finally got the venue I

wanted.  I'm Performing my dance

quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane

Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on

Tuesday night, and I'd love it if

you came and gave me notes.

DUDE

Sure Allan, I'll be there.

ALLAN

Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the

tenth.

DUDE

Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.

ALLAN

Just, uh, just slip the rent under

my door.

DUDE

Yeah, okay.

VOICE

--serious infraction, and examine

your standing.  Thank you.  Beep.

VOICE

Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please

do call us when you get in and I'll

send the limo.  Let me assure you--I

hope you're not avoiding this call

because of the rug, which, I assure

you, is not a problem.  We need your

help and, uh--well we would very

much like to see you.  Thank you.

It's Brandt.

BRANDT

We've had some terrible news.  Mr.

Lebowski is in seclusion in the West

Wing.

DUDE

Huh.

BRANDT

Mr. Lebowski.

LEBOWSKI

It's funny.  I can look back on a

life of achievement, on challenges

met, competitors bested, obstacles

overcome.  I've accomplished more

than most men, and without the use

of my legs.  What. . . What makes a

man, Mr. Lebowski?

DUDE

Dude.

LEBOWSKI

Huh?

DUDE

I don't know, sir.

LEBOWSKI

Is it. . . is it, being prepared to

do the right thing?  Whatever the

price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

DUDE

Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

LEBOWSKI

You're joking.  But perhaps you're

right.

DUDE

Mind if I smoke a jay?

LEBOWSKI

Bunny.

DUDE

'Scuse me?

LEBOWSKI

Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light

of my life.  Are you surprised at my

tears, sir?

DUDE

Fuckin' A.

LEBOWSKI

Strong men also cry. . . Strong men

also cry.

LEBOWSKI

I received this fax this morning.

LEBOWSKI

As you can see, it is a ransom note.

Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable

to achieve on a level field of play.

Men who will not sign their names.

Weaklings.  Bums.

DUDE

Bummer.

LEBOWSKI

Brandt will fill you in on the

details.

BRANDT

Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a

generous offer to you to act as

courier once we get instructions for

the money.

DUDE

Why me, man?

BRANDT

He suspects that the culprits might

be the very people who, uh, soiled

your rug, and you're in a unique

position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm

that suspicion.

DUDE

So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers,

huh?

BRANDT

Well Dude, we just don't know.

DUDE

Fucking Quintana--that creep can

roll, man--

WALTER

Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert,

Dude.

DUDE

Huh?

WALTER

The man is a sex offender.  With a

record.  Spent six months in Chino

for exposing himself to an eight-

year-old.

DUDE

Huh.

WALTER

When he moved down to Venice he had

to go door-to-door to tell everyone

he's a pederast.

DONNY

What's a pederast, Walter?

WALTER

Shut the fuck up, Donny.

WALTER

Anyway.  How much they offer you?

DUDE

Twenty grand.  And of course I still

keep the rug.

WALTER

Just for making the hand-off?

DUDE

Yeah.

DUDE

...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so

whenever these guys call--

WALTER

What if it's during a game?

DUDE

I told him if it was during league

play--

DONNY

If what's during league play?

WALTER

Life does not stop and start at your

convenience, you miserable piece of

shit.

DONNY

What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

DUDE

I figure it's easy money, it's all

pretty harmless.  I mean she probably

kidnapped herself.

WALTER

Huh?

DONNY

What do you mean, Dude?

DUDE

Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean

look at it.  Young trophy wife.

Marries a guy for money but figures

he isn't giving her enough.  She

owes money all over town--

WALTER

That...fucking...bitch!

DUDE

It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin

said, look for the person who will

benefit.  And you will, uh, you know,

you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying

to say--

DONNY

I am the Walrus.

WALTER

That fucking bitch!

DUDE

Yeah.

DONNY

I am the Walrus.

WALTER

Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!

Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

DONNY

What the fuck is he talking about?

WALTER

That's fucking exactly what happened,

Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

DUDE

Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?

DONNY

Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed

off?

WALTER

Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking

thing-- I did not watch my buddies

die face down in the muck so that

this fucking strumpet--

DUDE

I don't see any connection to Vietnam,

Walter.

WALTER

Well, there isn't a literal

connection, Dude.

DUDE

Walter, face it, there isn't any

connection.  It's your roll.

WALTER

Have it your way.  The point is--

DUDE

It's your roll--

WALTER

The fucking point is--

DUDE

It's your roll.

VOICE

Are you ready to be fucked, man?

QUINTANA

I see you rolled your way into the

semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and

me, we're gonna fuck you up.

DUDE

Yeah well, that's just, ya know,

like, your opinion, man.

QUINTANA

Let me tell you something, bendeco.

You pull any your crazy shit with

us, you flash a piece out on the

lanes, I'll take it away from you

and stick it up your ass and pull

the fucking trigger til it goes

"click".

DUDE

Jesus.

QUINTANA

You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with

the Jesus.

WALTER

Eight-year-olds, Dude.

DUDE

Oh man.

BRANDT

They called about eighty minutes

ago.  They want you to take the money

and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll

call you on the portable phone with

instructions in about forty minutes.

One person only or I'd go with you.

They were very clear on that: one

person only.  What happened to your

jaw?

DUDE

Oh, nothin', you know.

BRANDT

Here's the money, and the phone.

Please, Dude, follow whatever

instructions they give.

DUDE

Uh-huh.

BRANDT

Her life is in your hands.

DUDE

Oh, man, don't say that..

BRANDT

Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:

Her life is in your hands.

DUDE

Shit.

BRANDT

Her life is in your hands, Dude.

And report back to us as soon as

it's done.

WALTER

Take the ringer.  I'll drive.

DUDE

The what?

WALTER

The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have

they called yet?

DUDE

What the hell is this?

WALTER

My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.

The whites.

DUDE

Agh--

DUDE

Walter, I'm sure there's a reason

you brought your dirty undies--

WALTER

Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.

The ringer can't look empty.

DUDE

Walter--what the fuck are you

thinking?

WALTER

Well you're right, Dude, I got to

thinking.  I got to thinking why

should we settle for a measly fucking

twenty grand--

DUDE

We?  What the fuck we?  You said you

just wanted to come along--

WALTER

My point, Dude, is why should we

settle for twenty grand when we can

keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

DUDE

Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a

fucking game, Walter--

WALTER

It is a fucking game.  You said so

yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

DUDE '

Yeah, but--

DUDE

Dude here.

VOICE

(German accent)

Who is this?

DUDE

Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want

us to go?

VOICE

...Us?

DUDE

VOICE

Shut the fuck up.

(Beat)

Hello?

DUDE

Yeah?

VOICE

Okay, listen--

WALTER

Dude, are you fucking this up?

VOICE

Who is that?

DUDE

The driver man, I told you--

DUDE

Oh shit.  Walter.

WALTER

What the fuck is going on there?

DUDE

They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it

up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was

in our hands!

WALTER

Easy, Dude.

DUDE

We're screwed now!  We don't get

shit and they're gonna kill her!

We're fucked, Walter!

WALTER

Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.

You're being very unDude.  They'll

call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--

WALTER

Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here,

Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These

guys are fucking amateurs--

DUDE

Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say

peep when I'm doing business here.

WALTER

(patronizing)

Okay Dude.  Have it your way.

WALTER

But they're amateurs.

DUDE

Dude here.

VOICE

Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there

is no funny stuff.

DUDE

Yeah.

VOICE

So no funny stuff.  Okay?

DUDE

Hey, just tell me where the fuck you

want us to go.

DUDE

That was the sign.

WALTER

Yeah.  So as long as we get her back,

nobody's in a position to complain.

And we keep the baksheesh.

DUDE

Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't

told me how we get her back.  Where

is she?

WALTER

That's the simple part, Dude.  When

we make the handoff, I grab the guy

and beat  it out of him.

WALTER

...Huh?

DUDE

Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.

That's fucking ingenious, if I

understand it correctly.  That's a

Swiss fucking watch.

WALTER

Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of

this is its simplicity. If the plan

gets too complex something always

goes wrong.  If there's one thing I

learned in Nam--

DUDE

Dude.

VOICE

You are approaching a vooden britch.

When you cross it you srow ze bag

from ze left vindow of ze moving

kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch

you.

DUDE

FUCK.

WALTER

What'd he say?  Where's the hand-

off?

DUDE

There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!

At a wooden bridge we throw the money

out  of the car!

WALTER

Huh?

DUDE

We throw the money out of the moving

car!

WALTER

We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks

up our plan.

DUDE

Well call them up and explain it to

'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking

simple, I'm sure they'd fucking

understand it!  That's the beauty of

it Walter!

WALTER

Wooden bridge, huh?

DUDE

I'm throwing the money, Walter!

We're not fucking around!

WALTER

The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the

ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!

DUDE

Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but

sooner or later you're gonna have to

face the fact that you're a goddamn

moron.

WALTER

Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's

the bridge--

DUDE

Walter!

WALTER

Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

DUDE

What the fuck?

WALTER

Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch

I roll out!  I double back, grab one

of 'em and beat it out of him!  The

uzi!

DUDE

Uzi?

WALTER

You didn't think I was rolling out

of here naked!

DUDE

Walter, please--

WALTER

Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's

take that hill!

DUDE

WE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!

DUDE

WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!

WALTER

Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.

WALTER

Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used

to say.

DUDE

What the fuck is that supposed to

mean?  What the fuck're we gonna

tell Lebowski?

WALTER

Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't

see, um-- what exactly is the problem?

DUDE

Huh?  The problem is--what do you

mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--

they're gonna kill that poor woman--

WALTER

What the fuck're you talking about?

That poor woman--that poor slut--

kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said

so yourself--

DUDE

No, Walter!  I said I thought she

kidnapped herself!  You're the one

who's so fucking certain--

WALTER

That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--

DONNY

They posted the next round of the

tournament--

WALTER

Donny, shut the f--when do we play?

DONNY

This Saturday.  Quintana and--

WALTER

Saturday!  Well they'll have to

reschedule.

DUDE

Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?

WALTER

I told that fuck down at the league

office-- who's in charge of

scheduling?

DUDE

Walter--

DONNY

Burkhalter.

WALTER

I told that kraut a fucking thousand

times I don't roll on shabbas.

DONNY

It's already posted.

WALTER

WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!

DUDE

Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about

that poor woman?  What do we tell--

WALTER

C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get

sick of her little game and, you

know, wander back--

DONNY

How come you don't roll on Saturday,

Walter?

WALTER

I'm shomer shabbas.

DONNY

What's that, Walter?

DUDE

Yeah, and in the meantime what do I

tell Lebowski?

WALTER

Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of

rest.  Means I don't work, I don't

drive a car, I don't fucking ride in

a car, I don't handle money, I don't

turn on the oven, and I sure as shit

don't fucking roll!

DONNY

Sheesh.

DUDE

Walter, how--

WALTER

Shomer shabbas.

DUDE

That's it.  I'm out of here.

WALTER

For Christ's sake, Dude.

DONNY

Oh yeah, how'd it go?

WALTER

Went alright.  Dude's car got a little

dinged up--

DUDE

But Walter, we didn't make the fucking

hand- off!  They didn't get, the

fucking money and they're gonna--

they're gonna--

WALTER

Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

WALTER

Kill that poor woman.

DONNY

Walter, if you can't ride in a car,

how d'you get around on Shammas--

WALTER

Really, Dude, you surprise me.

They're not gonna kill shit.  They're

not gonna do shit.  What can they

do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile,

look at the bottom line.  Who's

sitting on a million fucking dollars?

Am I wrong?

DUDE

Walter--

WALTER

Who's got a fucking million fucking

dollars parked in the trunk of our

car out here?

DUDE

"Our" car, Walter?

WALTER

And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty

undies.  My fucking whites--Say,

where is  the car?

DONNY

Who has your undies, Walter?

WALTER

Where's your car, Dude?

DUDE

You don't know, Walter?  You seem to

know the answer to everything else!

WALTER

Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped

spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.

DUDE

It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking

know it's been stolen!

WALTER

Well, certainly that's a possibility,

Dude--

DUDE

Aw, fuck it.

DONNY

Where you going, Dude?

DUDE

I'm going home, Donny.

DONNY

Your phone's ringing, Dude.

DUDE

Thank you, Donny.

DUDE

1972 Pontiac LeBaron.

YOUNGER COP

Color?

DUDE

Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust,

coloration.

YOUNGER COP

And was there anything of value in

the car?

DUDE

Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple

of Creedence tapes.  And there was

a, uh. . . my briefcase.

YOUNGER COP

In the briefcase?

DUDE

Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my

papers.  Business papers.

YOUNGER COP

And what do you do, sir?

DUDE

I'm unemployed.

OLDER COP

...Most people, we're working nights,

they offer us coffee.

DUDE

...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But

it's nice when they offer.

DUDE

...Also, my rug was stolen.

YOUNGER COP

Your rug was in the car.

DUDE

No.  Here.

YOUNGER COP

Separate incidents?

OLDER COP

Snap out of it, son.

DUDE

You find them much?  Stolen cars?

YOUNGER COP

Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much

hope for the tape deck though.  Or

the Creedence tapes.

DUDE

And the, uh, the briefcase?

FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE

Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.

Call when you get home and I'll send

a car for you.  My name is Maude

Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took

the rug.

OLDER COP

Well, I guess we can close the file

on that one.

VOICE

I'll be with you in a minute, Mr.

Lebowski.

DUDE

Is that what that's a picture of?

MAUDE

In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe.

My art has been commended as being

strongly vaginal.  Which bothers

some men.  The word itself makes

some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

DUDE

Oh yeah?

MAUDE

Yes, they don't like hearing it and

find it difficult to say.  Whereas

without batting an eye a man will

refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or

his "Johnson".

DUDE

"Johnson"?

MAUDE

Thank you.

DUDE

Huh?

MAUDE

Yes, I know about it.  And I know

that you acted as courier.  And let

me tell you something:  the whole

thing stinks to high heaven.

DUDE

Right, but let me explain something

about that rug--

MAUDE

Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

DUDE

Excuse me?

MAUDE

Sex.  The physical act of love.

Coitus.  Do you like it?

DUDE

I was talking about my rug.

MAUDE

You're not interested in sex?

DUDE

You mean coitus?

MAUDE

I like it too.  It's a male myth

about feminists that we hate sex.

It can be a natural, zesty enterprise.

But unfortunately there are some

people--it is called satyriasis in

men, nymphomania in women--who engage

in it compulsively and without joy.

DUDE

Oh, no.

MAUDE

Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate

souls cannot love in the true sense

of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance

Bunny is one of these.

DUDE

Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your

stepmother is a nympho, but I don't

see what it has to do with--do you

have any kalhua?

MAUDE

Take a look at this, sir.

DIETER

Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere

iss problem mit deine kable.

DUDE

Shit, I know that guy.  He's a

nihilist.

MAUDE

And you recognize her, of course.

DIETER

Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.

MAUDE

(grimly)

The story is ludicrous.

DIETER

Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to

verk in zese clozes--

MAUDE

Lord.  You can imagine where it goes

from here.

DUDE

He fixes the cable?

MAUDE

Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little

matter to me that this woman chose

to pursue a career

DUDE

Shit yeah, the achievers.

MAUDE

Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,

yes, and proud we are of all of them.

I asked my father about his withdrawal

of a million dollars from the

Foundation account and he told me

about this "abduction", but I tell

you it is preposterous.  This

compulsive

DUDE

Yeah, but my-

MAUDE

I'm getting to your rug. My  father

and I don't get along; he doesn't

approve of my lifestyle and, needless

to say, I don't approve of his.

Still, I hardly wish to make my

father's embezzlement a police matter,

so I'm proposing that you try to

recover the money from the people

you delivered it to.

DUDE

Well--sure, I could do that--

MAUDE

If you successfully do so, I will

compensate you to the tune of 1% of

the recovered sum.

DUDE

A hundred.

MAUDE

Thousand, yes, bones or clams or

whatever you call them.

DUDE

Yeah, but what about--

MAUDE

--your rug, yes, well with that money

you can buy any number of rugs that

don't have sentimental value for me.

And I am sorry about that crack on

the jaw.

DUDE

Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

MAUDE

Here's the name and number of a doctor

who will look at it for you.  You

will receive no bill.  He's a good

man, and thorough.

DUDE

That's really thoughtful but I--

MAUDE

Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a

good man, and thorough.

DRIVER

--So he says, "My son can't hold a

job, my daughter's married to a

fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on

my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.

But you know me.  I can't complain."

DUDE

Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.

Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya

Tony.

TONY

Aw, forget about it.

DUDE

Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be

worrying about that shit.  Life goes

on!

TONY

Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your

friend in the Volkswagon?

DUDE

Huh?

DUDE

When did he-

SECOND CHAUFFEUR

Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No

arguments.

DUDE

Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!

LEBOWSKI

Start talking and talk fast you lousy

bum!

BRANDT

We've been frantically trying to

reach you, Dude.

LEBOWSKI

Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!

DUDE

Well we--I don't--

LEBOWSKI

They did not receive the money, you

nitwit!  They  did not receive the

goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR

HANDS!

BRANDT

This is our concern, Dude.

DUDE

No, man, nothing is fucked here--

LEBOWSKI

NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE

HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!

DUDE

C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?

Those guys are--we dropped off the

damn money--

LEBOWSKI

WHAT?!

DUDE

I--the royal we, you know, the

editorial--I dropped off the money,

exactly as per--Look, I've got certain

information, certain things have

come to light, and uh, has it ever

occurred to you, man, that given the

nature of all this new shit, that,

uh, instead of running around blaming

me, that this whole thing might just

be, not, you know, not just such a

simple, but uh--you know?

LEBOWSKI

What in God's holy name are you

blathering about?

DUDE

I'll tell you what I'm blathering

about!  I got information--new shit

has come to light and--shit, man!

She kidnapped herself!

DUDE

Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy

wife, I mean, in the parlance of our

times, owes money all over town,

including to known pornographers--

and that's cool, that's cool-- but

I'm saying, she needs money, and of

course they're gonna say they didn't

get it 'cause she wants more, man,

she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--

hasn't that ever occurred to you...?

Sir?

LEBOWSKI

(quietly)

No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not

occurred to me.

BRANDT

That had not occurred to us, Dude.

DUDE

Well, okay, you're not privy to all

the new shit, so uh, you know, but

that's what you pay me for.  Speaking

of which, would it be possible for

me to get my twenty grand in cash?

I gotta check this with my accountant

of course, but my concern is that,

you know, it could bump me into a

higher tax--

LEBOWSKI

Brandt, give him the envelope.

DUDE

Well, okay, if you've already made

out the check.  Brandt is handing

him a letter-sized envelope which is

distended by something inside.

BRANDT

We received it this morning.

LEBOWSKI

Since you have failed to achieve,

even in the modest task that was

your charge, since you have stolen

my money, and since you have

unrepentantly betrayed my trust.

LEBOWSKI

I have no choice but to tell these

bums that they should do whatever is

necessary to recover their money

from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And

with Brandt as my witness, tell you

this:  Any further harm visited upon

Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon

your head.

LEBOWSKI

...By God sir.  I will not abide

another toe.

WALTER

That wasn't her toe.

DUDE

Whose toe was it, Walter?

WALTER

How the fuck should I know?  I do

know that nothing about it indicates--

DUDE

The nail polish, Walter.

WALTER

Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible

to get some nail polish, apply it to

someone else's toe--

DUDE

Someone else's--where the fuck are

they gonna--

WALTER

You want a toe?  I can get you a

toe, believe me.  There are ways,

Dude.  You don't wanna know about

it, believe me.

DUDE

But Walter--

WALTER

I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this

afternoon--with nail  polish. These

fucking amateurs.   They send us a

toe, we're  supposed to  shit our-

selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My

point is--

DUDE

They're gonna kill her, Walter, and

then they're gonna kill me--

WALTER

Well that's just, that's the stress

talking, Dude.  So far we have what

looks to me like a series of

victimless crimes--

DUDE

What about the toe?

WALTER

FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!

WAITRESS

Could you please keep your voices

down--this is a family restaurant.

WALTER

Oh, please dear!  I've got news for

you: the Supreme Court has roundly

rejected prior restraint!

DUDE

Walter, this isn't a First Amendment

thing.

WAITRESS

Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going

to have to ask you to leave.

WALTER

Lady, I got buddies who died face-

down in the muck so you and I could

enjoy this family restaurant!

DUDE

All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry

ma'am.

WALTER

Don't run away from this, Dude!

Goddamnit, this affects all of us!

WALTER

Our basic freedoms!

WALTER

I'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.

WALTER

Finishing my coffee.

POLICEMAN

You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.

Lebowski. Must've been a joyride

situation; they abandoned the car

once they hit the retaining wall.

POLICEMAN

These were on the road next to the

car.  You'll have to get in on the

other side.

DUDE

My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!

POLICEMAN

Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.

You're lucky they left the tape deck

though.

DUDE

My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's

that smell?

POLICEMAN

Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept

in the car.  Or perhaps just used it

as a toilet, and moved on.

DUDE

When will you find these guys?  I

mean, do you have any promising leads?

POLICEMAN

Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with

the boys down at the Crime Lab.

They've assigned four more detectives

to the case, got us working in shifts.

DONNY

And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

WALTER

Oh for Christ--will you shut the

fuck up, Donny.

DUDE

I figure my only hope is that the

big Lebowski kills me before the

Germans can cut my dick off.

WALTER

Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No

one is going to cut your dick off.

DUDE

Thanks Walter.

WALTER

Not if I have anything to say about

it.

DUDE

(bitterly)

Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me

a very secure feeling.

WALTER

Dude--

DUDE

That makes me feel all warm inside.

WALTER

Now Dude--

DUDE

This whole fucking thing--I  could

be sitting here with just pee-stains

on my rug.

WALTER

Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.

Fucking Nazis.

DONNY

They were Nazis, Dude?

WALTER

Come on, Donny, they were threatening

castration!

DONNY

Uh-huh.

WALTER

Are you gonna split hairs?

DONNY

No--

WALTER

Am I wrong?

DONNY

Well--

DUDE

They're nihilists.

WALTER

Huh?

DUDE

They kept saying they believe in

nothing.

WALTER

Nihilists!  Jesus.

DUDE

Yeah.

WALTER

And let's also not forget--let's not

forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife,

an amphibious rodent, for uh,

domestic, you know, within the city--

that isn't legal either.

DUDE

What're you, a fucking park ranger

now?

WALTER

No, I'm--

DUDE

Who gives a shit about the fucking

marmot!

WALTER

--We're sympathizing here, Dude--

DUDE

Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need

your sympathy, man, I need my fucking

Johnson!

DONNY

What do you need that for, Dude?

WALTER

You gotta buck up, man, you can't go

into the tournament with this negative

attitude--

DUDE

Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you,

Walter!

WALTER

Fuck the tournament?!

WALTER

Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want

to be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's

DUDE

VOICE

Dude!  Dude!

MAUDE

Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the

doctor.

DUDE

No it's fine, really, uh--

MAUDE

Do you have any news regarding my

father's money?

DUDE

I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta

respecfully, 69 you know, tender my

resignation on that matter, 'cause

it looks like your mother really was

kidnapped after all.

MAUDE

She most certainly was not!

DUDE

Hey man, why don't you fucking listen

occasionally?  You might learn

something.  Now I got--

MAUDE

And please don't call her my mother.

DUDE

Now I got--

MAUDE

She is most definitely the perpetrator

and not the victim.

DUDE

I'm telling you, I got definitive

evidence--

MAUDE

From who?

DUDE

The main guy, Dieter--

MAUDE

Dieter Hauff?

DUDE

Well--yeah, I guess--

MAUDE

Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

DUDE

Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean,

you know him?

MAUDE

Dieter has been on the fringes of--

well, of everything in L.A., for

about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.

Under 'Autobahn.'

MAUDE

That was his group--they released

one album in the mid-seventies.

DUDE

Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.

MAUDE

Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their

music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

DUDE

Jeez.  I miss vinyl.

MAUDE

Is he pretending to be the abductor?

DUDE

Well...yeah--

MAUDE

Look, Jeffrey, you don't really

kidnap someone that you're acquainted

with.  You can't get away with it if

the hostage knows who you are.

DUDE

Well yeah...I know that.

MAUDE

So Dieter has the money?

DUDE

Well, no, not exactly.  It's a

complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.

Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to

keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands

in old Duder's--

MAUDE

Do you still have that doctor's

number?

DUDE

Huh?  No, really, I don't even have

the bruise any more, I--

MAUDE

Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be

responsible for any delayed after-

effects.

DUDE

Delayed after-eff--

MAUDE

I want you to see him immediately.

MAUDE

I'll see if he's available.  He's a

good man, and thorough.

VOICE

Could you slide your shorts down

please, Mr.  Lebowski?

DUDE

Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.

VOICE

I understand sir.  Could you slide

your shorts down please?

DUDE

Fuck Me.

DUDE

Fuckola, man.

WALTER

He lives in North Hollywood on

Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

DUDE

The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

WALTER

Near the In-and-Out Burger--

DONNY

Those are good burgers, Walter.

WALTER

Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid

is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his

father is--are you ready for this?--

Arthur Digby Sellers.

DUDE

Who the fuck is that?

WALTER

Huh?

DUDE

Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?

WALTER

Who the f--have you ever heard of a

little show called Branded, Dude?

DUDE

Yeah.

WALTER

All but one man died?  There at Bitter

Creek?

DUDE

Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show

Walter, so what?

WALTER

Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote

156 episodes, Dude.

DUDE

Uh-huh.

WALTER

The bulk of the series.

DUDE

Uh-huh.

WALTER

Not exactly a lightweight.

DUDE

No.

WALTER

And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

DUDE

Uh.

WALTER

Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out

WALTER

What have you.  We'll, uh--

DONNY

WALTER

Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh,

brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.

We'll get that fucking money, if he

hasn't spent it already.  Million

fucking clams. And yes, we'll be

near the, uh--some burgers, some

beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking

troubles are over, Dude.

DUDE

Fuck me, man!  That kid's already

spent all the money!

WALTER

Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's

still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand,

depending on the options.  Wait in

the car, Donny.

WOMAN

Jace?

WALTER

Hello, Pilar?  My name is Walter

Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this

is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.

WOMAN

Jace.

WALTER

May we uh, we wanted to talk about

little Larry.  May we come in?

WOMAN

PILAR

WALTER

That's him, Dude.

VIVA VOCE

And a good day to you, sir.

PILAR

See down, please.

WALTER

Thank you, ma'am.

WALTER

Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?

PILAR

No, no.  He has healt' problems.

WALTER

Uh-huh.

WALTER

I just want to say, sir, that we're

both enormous--on a personal level,

Branded, especially the early

episodes, has been a source of, uh,

inspir---

PILAR

See down, Sweetie.  These are the

policeman--

WALTER

No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the

impression that we're police exactly.

We're hoping that it will not be

necessary to call the police.

WALTER

But that is up to little Larry here.

Isn't it, Larry?

WALTER

Is this your homework, Larry?

WALTER

Is this your homework, Larry?

DUDE

Look, man, did you--

WALTER

Dude, please!. . .  Is this your

homework, Larry?

DUDE

Just ask him if he--ask him about

the car, man!

WALTER

Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your

homework, Larry?

DUDE

Is the car out front yours?

WALTER

Is this your homework, Larry?

DUDE

We know it's his fucking homework,

Walter!  Where's the fucking money,

you little brat?

WALTER

Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard

of Vietnam?

DUDE

Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

WALTER

You're going to enter a world of

pain, son.  We know that this is

your homework.  We know you stole a

car--

DUDE

And the fucking money!

WALTER

And the fucking money.  And we know

that this is your homework, Larry.

WALTER

You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.

WALTER

Ah, this is pointless.

WALTER

All right, Plan B.  You might want

to watch out the front window there,

Larry.

WALTER

This is what happens when you FUCK a

STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.

WALTER

Fucking language problem, Dude.

WALTER

Maybe he'll understand this.

WALTER

YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

WALTER

YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!

WALTER

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A

STRANGER IN THE ASS!

WALTER

HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

WALTER

HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER

IN THE ASS!

MAN

WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!

MAN

I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!

WALTER

Hunh?

MAN

I KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR

FUCKEEN CAR!

DUDE

No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--

MAN

I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

MAN

I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

MAN

I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO:

DUDE

I accept your apology. . . No I, I

just want to handle it myself from

now on. . . No.  That has nothing to

do with it. . . .Yes, it made it

home, I'm calling from home.  No,

Walter, it didn't look like Larry

was about to crack.

DUDE

Well that's your perception. . .

Well you're right, Walter, and the

unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND

LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah,

I'll be at practice.

DUDE

Huh?

WOO

Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie

Treehorn wants to see you.

BLOND MAN

And we know which Lebowski you are,

Lebowski.

WOO

Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk

to the deadbeat Lebowski.

BLOND MAN

You're not dealing with morons here.

MAN

Hello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm

Jackie Treehorn.

DUDE

This is quite a pad you got here,

man.  Completely unspoiled.

TREEHORN

What's your drink, Dude?

DUDE

White Russian, thanks.  How's the

smut business, Jackie?

TREEHORN

I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in

publishing, entertainment, political

advocacy, and--

DUDE

Which one was Logjammin'?

TREEHORN

Regrettably, it's true, standards

have fallen in adult entertainment.

It's video, Dude.  Now that we're

competing with the amateurs, we can't

afford to invest that little extra

in story, production value, feeling.

TREEHORN

People forget that the brain is the

biggest erogenous zone--

DUDE

On you, maybe.

TREEHORN

Of course, you do get the good with

the bad.  The new technology permits

us to do exciting things with

interactive erotic software.  Wave

of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.

DUDE

Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off

manually.

TREEHORN

Of course you do.  I can see you're

anxious for me to get to the point.

Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?

DUDE

I thought you might know, man.

TREEHORN

Me?  How would I know?  The only

reason she ran off was to get away

from her rather sizable debt to me.

DUDE

But she hasn't run off, she's been--

TREEHORN

I've heard the kidnapping story, so

save it.  I know you're mixed up in

all this, Dude, and I don't care

what you're trying to take off her

husband.  That's your business.  All

I'm saying is, I want mine.

DUDE

Yeah, well, right man, there are

many facets to this, uh, you know,

many interested parties.  If I can

find your money, man-- what's in it

for the Dude?

TREEHORN

Of course, there's that to discuss.

Refill?

DUDE

Does the Pope shit in the woods?

TREEHORN

Let's say a 10% finder's fee?

DUDE

Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way

you do business.  Your money is being

held by a kid named Larry Sellers.

He lives in North Hollywood, on

Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.

A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure

your goons'll be able to get it off

him, mean he's only fifteen and he's

flunking social studies.  So if you'll

just write me a check for my ten per

cent. . . of half a million. . .

fifty grand.

DUDE

I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you

mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.

TREEHORN

A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your

idea of a joke?

DUDE

No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's

got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just

wanted a car.  All the Dude ever

wanted. . . was his rug back. . .

not greedy. . . it really.

THE STRANGER'S VOICE

Darkness warshed over the Dude--

darker'n a black steer's tookus on a

moonless prairie night.  There was

no bottom.

DUDE

He was innocent.  Not a charge was

true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.

CHIEF

This is your only I.D.?

DUDE

I know my rights.

CHIEF

You don't know shit, Lebowski.

DUDE

I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I

want Bill Kunstler.

CHIEF

What are you, some kind of sad-assed

refugee from the fucking sixties?

DUDE

Uh-huh.

CHIEF

Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to

eject you from his garden party,

that you were drunk and abusive.

DUDE

That guy treats women like objects,

man.

CHIEF

Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in

this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw

shit.  We got a nice quiet beach

community here, and I aim to keep it

nice and quiet.  So let me make

something plain.  I don't like you

sucking around bothering our citizens,

Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk-

off name, I don't like your jerk-off

face, I don't like your jerk- off

behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-

off --do I make myself clear?

DUDE

I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

DUDE

--Ow!  Fucking fascist!

CHIEF

Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

CHIEF

Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep

your ugly fucking goldbricking ass

out of my beach community!

DUDE

Jesus, man, can you change the

station?

DRIVER

Fuck you man!  You don't like my

fucking music, get your own fucking

cab!

DUDE

I've had a--

DRIVER

I pull over and kick your ass out,

man!

DUDE

--had a rough night, and I hate the

fucking Eagles, man--

DRIVER

That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

DUDE

Jesus.

MAUDE

Jeffrey.

DUDE

Maude?

MAUDE

Love me.

DUDE

That's my robe.

THOOMP!  ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO:

MAUDE

Tell me a little about yourself,

Jeffrey.

DUDE

Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

DUDE

I was, uh, one of the authors of the

Port Huron Statement.--The original

Port Huron Statement.

MAUDE

Uh-huh.

DUDE

Not the compromised second draft.

And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the

Seattle Seven?

MAUDE

Mmnun.

DUDE

And then. . . let's see, I uh--music

business briefly.

MAUDE

Oh?

DUDE

Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed

of Sound Tour.

MAUDE

Uh-huh.

DUDE

Bunch of assholes.  And then, you

know, little of this, little of that.

My career's, uh, slowed down a bit

lately.

MAUDE

What do you do for fun?

DUDE

Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.

Drive around.  The occasional acid

flashback.

MAUDE

What happened to your house?

DUDE

Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.

Wanted to save the finder's fee.

MAUDE

Finder's fee?

DUDE

He thought I had your father's money,

so he got me out of the way while he

looked for it.

MAUDE

It's not my father's money, it's the

Foundation's.  Why did he think you

had it?  And who does?

DUDE

Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.

Real fucking brat.

MAUDE

Jeffrey--

DUDE

It's a complicated case, Maude.

Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately

I've been adhering to a pretty strict,

uh, drug regimen to keep my mind,

you know, limber.  I'm real fucking

close to your father's money, real

fucking close.  It's just--

MAUDE

I keep telling you, it's the

Foundation's money.  Father doesn't

have any.

DUDE

Huh?  He's fucking loaded.

MAUDE

No no, the wealth was all Mother's.

DUDE

But your father--he runs stuff, he--

MAUDE

We did let Father run one of the

companies, briefly, but he didn't do

very well at it.

DUDE

But he's--

MAUDE

He helps administer the charities

now, and I give him a reasonable

allowance.  He has no money of his

own.  I know how he likes to present

himself; Father's weakness is vanity.

Hence the slut.

DUDE

Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is

that yoga?

MAUDE

It increases the chances of

conception.

DUDE

Increases?

MAUDE

Well yes, what did you think this

was all about?  Fun and games?

DUDE

Well...no, of course not--

MAUDE

I want a child.

DUDE

Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

MAUDE

Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.

In fact I don't want the father to

be someone I have to see socially,

or who'll have any interest in rearing

the child himself.

DUDE

Huh...

DUDE

So...that doctor.

MAUDE

Exactly.  What happened to your face?

Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

DUDE

No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.

A real reactionary. . . So your

father. . . Oh man, I get it!

MAUDE

What?

DUDE

Yeah, my thinking about the case,

man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.

Your father--

PHONE VOICE

This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in;

leave a message after the beep.

MAUDE'S VOICE

What're you talking about?

DUDE

Walter, if you're there, pick up the

fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter,

this is an emergency.  I'm not--

WALTER

Dude?

DUDE

Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I

need you to come pick me up--

WALTER

I can't drive, Dude, it's erev

shabbas.

DUDE

Huh?

WALTER

Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm

not even supposed to pick up the

phone, unless it's an emergency.

DUDE

It is a fucking emergency.

WALTER

I understand.  That's why I picked

up the phone.

DUDE

THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind,

just call Donny then, and ask him to--

WALTER

Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--

DUDE

WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA

GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR

I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!

MAUDE'S VOICE

Jeffrey?

DUDE

Get out of that fucking car, man!

DUDE

Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on,

man!

MAN

Relax, man!  No physical harm

intended!

DUDE

Who the fuck are you?  Why've you

been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

MAN

Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

DUDE

Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

MAN

Irish m--What the fuck are you talking

about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a

private snoop!  Like you, man!

DUDE

Huh?

DA FINO

A dick, man!  And let me tell you

something: I dig your work. Playing

one side against the other--in bed

with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

DUDE

I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay

away from my fucking lady friend,

man.

DA FINO

Hey hey, I'm not messing with your

special lady--

DUDE

She's not my special lady, she's my

fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping

her conceive, man!

DA FINO

Hey, man, I'm not--

DUDE

Who're you working for?  Lebowski?

Jackie Treehorn?

DA FINO

The Gundersons.

DUDE

The?  Who the fff--

DA FINO

The Gundersons.  It's a wandering

daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.

Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.

Her parents want her back.

DA FINO

See?

DUDE

Jesus fucking Christ.

DA FINO

Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

DUDE

Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on

the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.

DA FINO

Fuck, man!  That's terrible!

DUDE

Yeah, it sucks.

DA FINO

Well maybe you and me could pool our

resources--trade information--

professional courtesy--compeers, you

know--

DUDE

Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.

And stay away from my special la--

from my fucking lady friend.

WAITRESS

You folks ready?

DIETER

I haff lingenberry pancakes.

KIEFFER

Lingenberry pancakes.

FRANZ

Sree picks in blanket.

DIETER

Lingenberry pancakes.

DUDE

I mean we totally fucked it up, man.

We fucked up his pay-off.  And got

the kidnappers all pissed off, and

the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot,

but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

WALTER

Well it's, sometimes the cathartic,

uh.

DUDE

I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-

up, then why does he still leave me

in charge of getting back his wife?

Because he fucking doesn't want her

back, man!  He's had enough!  He no

longer digs her!  It's all a show!

But then, why didn't he give a shit

about his million bucks?  I mean, he

knew we didn't hand off his briefcase,

but he never asked for it back.

WALTER

What's your point, Dude?

DUDE

His million bucks was never in it,

man!  There was no money in that

briefcase!  He was hoping they'd

kill her!  You throw out a ringer

for a ringer!

WALTER

Yeah?

DUDE

Shit yeah!

WALTER

Okay, but how does all this add up

to an emergency?

DUDE

Huh?

WALTER

I'm saying, I see what you're getting

at, Dude, he kept the money, but my

point is, here we are, it's shabbas,

the sabbath, which I'm allowed to

break only if it's a matter of life

and death--

DUDE

Walter, come off it.  You're not

even fucking Jewish, you're--

WALTER

What the fuck are you talking about?

DUDE

You're fucking Polish Catholic--

WALTER

What the fuck are you talking about?

I converted when I married Cynthia!

Come on, Dude!

DUDE

Yeah, and you were--

WALTER

You know this!

DUDE

And you were divorced five fucking

years ago.

WALTER

Yeah?  What do you think happens

when you get divorced?  You turn in

your library card?  Get a new driver's

license?  Stop being Jewish?

DUDE

This driveway.

WALTER

I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

DUDE

It's just part of your whole sick

Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her

fucking dog.  Going to her fucking

synagogue.  You're living in the

fucking past.

WALTER

Three thousand years of beautiful

tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--

YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE

PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell

happened?

WALTER

Jesus Christ.

BRANDT

He can't see you, Dude.

DUDE

Where'd she been?

BRANDT

Visiting friends of hers in Palm

Springs.  Just picked up and left,

never bothered to tell us.

DUDE

But I guess she told Dieter.

WALTER

Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped

her.

BRANDT

Who's this gentleman, Dude?

WALTER

Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!

BRANDT

You shouldn't go in there, Dude!

He's very angry!

LEBOWSKI

(bitterly)

Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.

DUDE

Where's the money, Lebowski?

WALTER

A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY

LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS!  YOU ARE

SCUM, MAN!

LEBOWSKI

Who the hell is he?

WALTER

I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy

who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY

GOLDBRICKING ASS!

DUDE

We know the briefcase was empty,

man.  We know you kept the million

bucks yourself.

LEBOWSKI

Well, you have your story, I have

mine.  I say I entrusted the money

to you, and you stole it.

WALTER

AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING

YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!

DUDE

You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped

and you could use it as a pretext to

make some money disappear.  All you

needed was a sap to pin it on, and

you'd just met me.  You thought,

hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone

the square community won't give a

shit about.

LEBOWSKI

Well?  Aren't you?

DUDE

Well. . . yeah.

LEBOWSKI

All right, get out.  Both of you.

WALTER

Look at that fucking phony, Dude!

Pretending to be a fucking

millionaire!

LEBOWSKI

I said out.  Now.

WALTER

Let me tell you something else.

I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude,

and this guy is a fake.  A fucking

goldbricker.

WALTER

This guy fucking walks.  I've never

been more certain of anything in my

life!

LEBOWSKI

Stay away from me, mister!

WALTER

Walk, you fucking phony!

LEBOWSKI

Put me down, you son of a bitch!

DUDE

Walter!

WALTER

It's all over, man!  We call your

fucking bluff!

DUDE

WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S

CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!

WALTER

Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS!

ACHTUNG, BABY!!

WALTER

Oh, shit.

LEBOWSKI

(sobbing)

You're bullies!  Cowards, both of

you!

WALTER

Oh, shit.

DUDE

He can't walk, Walter!

WALTER

Yeah, I can see that, Dude.

LEBOWSKI

You monsters!

DUDE

Help me put him back in his chair.

WALTER

Shit, sorry man.

LEBOWSKI

Stay away from me!  You bullies!

You and these women!  You won't leave

a man his fucking balls!

DUDE

Walter, you fuck!

WALTER

Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I

wouldn't've done it if I knew he was

a fucking crybaby.

DUDE

We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.

DUDE

There ya go.  Sorry man.

WALTER

Shit.  He didn't look like a spinal.

WALTER

Sure you'll see some tank battles.

But fighting in desert is very

different from fighting in canopy

jungle.

DUDE

Uh-huh.

WALTER

I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war

whereas, uh, this thing should be a

fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an

M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking

tank.  Just me and Charlie, man,

eyeball to eyeball.

DUDE

Yeah.

WALTER

That's fuckin' combat.  The man in

the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy

fuckin' adversary.

DONNY

Who's in pyjamas, Walter?

WALTER

Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch

Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

WALTER

Yeah.

WALTER

What's this?

DONNELLY

That is for the urn.

WALTER

Don't need it.  We're scattering the

ashes.

DONNELLY

Yes, so we were informed.  However,

we must of course transmit the remains

to you in a receptacle.

WALTER

This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

DONNELLY

Yes sir.  It is our most modestly

priced receptacle.

DUDE

Well can we--

WALTER

A hundred and eighty dollars?!

DONNELLY

They range up to three thousand.

WALTER

Yeah, but we're--

DUDE

Can we just rent it from you?

DONNELLY

Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental

house.

WALTER

We're scattering the fucking ashes!

DUDE

Walter--

WALTER

JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T

MEAN WE'RE SAPS!

DONNELLY

Sir, please lower your voice--

DUDE

Hey man, don't you have something

else you could put it in?

DONNELLY

That is our most modestly priced

receptacle.

WALTER

GODDAMNIT!  IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND

HERE?!

WALTER

I'll say a few words.

WALTER

Donny was a good bowler, and a good

man.  He was. . . He was one of us.

He was a man who loved the outdoors,

and bowling, and as a surfer explored

the beaches of southern California

from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he

was an avid bowler.  And a good

friend.  He died--he died as so many

of his generation, before his time.

In your wisdom you took him, Lord.

As you took so many bright flowering

young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc

and Hill 364.  These young men gave

their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny

who. . . who loved bowling.

WALTER

And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos,

in accordance with what we think

your dying wishes might well have

been, we commit your mortal remains

to the bosom of.

WALTER

the Pacific Ocean, which you loved

so well.

WALTER

Goodnight, sweet prince.

WALTER

Shit, I'm sorry Dude.

WALTER

Goddamn wind.

DUDE

Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking

asshole!

WALTER

Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

DUDE

You make everything a fucking

travesty!

WALTER

Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

DUDE

What about that shit about Vietnam!

WALTER

Dude, I'm sorry--

DUDE

What the fuck does Vietnam have to

do with anything!  What the fuck

were you talking about?!

WALTER

Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

DUDE

You're a fuck, Walter!

WALTER

Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.

DUDE

Two oat sodas, Gary.

GARY

Right.  Good luck tomorrow.

DUDE

Thanks, man.

GARY

Sorry to hear about Donny.

DUDE

Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you

eat the bear, and, uh.

THE STRANGER

Howdy do, Dude.

DUDE

Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered

if I'd see you again.

THE STRANGER

Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things

been goin'?

DUDE

Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters,

ups and downs.

THE STRANGER

Sure, I gotcha.

DUDE

Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I

gotta get back.

THE STRANGER

Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know

that you will.

DUDE

Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude

abides.

THE STRANGER

The Dude abides.

THE STRANGER

I don't know about you, but I take

comfort in that.  It's good knowin'

he's out there, the Dude, takin' her

easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I

sure hope he makes The finals.  Welp,

that about does her, wraps her all

up.  Things seem to've worked out

pretty good for the Dude'n Walter,

and it was a purt good story, dontcha

think?   Made me laugh to beat the

band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I

didn't like seein' Donny go. But

then, happen to know that there's a

little Lebowski on the way.  I guess

that's the way the whole durned human

comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self,

down through the generations, westward

the wagons, across the sands a time

until-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin'

again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed

yourselves.

THE STRANGER

Catch ya further on down the trail.

THE STRANGER

...Say friend, ya got any more a

that good sarsaparilla?...
