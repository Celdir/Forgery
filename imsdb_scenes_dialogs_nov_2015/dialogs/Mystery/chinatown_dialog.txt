CHINATOWN

Written by

Robert Towne

CURLY'S VOICE

(crying out)

Oh, no.

GITTES

All right, enough is enough. You

can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly.

I just had 'em installed on Wednesday.

GITTES

Down the hatch.

CURLY

(drinking, relaxing a

little)

She's just no good.

GITTES

What can I tell you, Kid? You're

right. When you're right, you're

right, and you're right.

CURLY

Ain't worth thinking about.

GITTES

You're absolutely right, I wouldn't

give her another thought.

CURLY

(pouring himself)

You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I

know it's your job, but you're okay.

GITTES

(settling back,

breathing a little

easier)

Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.

CURLY

Thanks. You know something, Jake?

GITTES

What's that, Curly?

CURLY

I think I'll kill her.

WOMAN

I was hoping Mr. Gittes could see to

this personally.

WALSH

(almost the manner of

someone comforting

the bereaved)

If you'll allow us to complete our

preliminary questioning, by then

he'll be free.

CURLY

(crying)

They don't kill a guy for that.

GITTES

Oh they don't?

CURLY

Not for your wife. That's the

unwritten law.

GITTES

I'll tell you the unwritten law, you

dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be

rich to kill somebody, anybody and

get away with it. You think you got

that kind of dough, you think you

got that kind of class?

CURLY

...No...

GITTES

You bet your ass you don't. You can't

even pay me off.

CURLY

I'll pay the rest next trip. We only

caught sixty ton of skipjack around

San Benedict. We hit a chubasco,

they don't pay you for skipjack the

way they do for tuna or albacore.

GITTES

(easing him out of

his office)

Forget it. I only mention it to

illustrate a point...

GITTES

I don't want your last dime.

GITTES

(continuing)

What kind of guy do you think I am?

CURLY

Thanks, Mr. Gittes.

GITTES

Call me Jake. Careful driving home,

Curly.

SOPHIE

A Mrs. Mulwray is waiting for you,

with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

WALSH

Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr.

Gittes?

GITTES

How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?

MRS. MULWRAY

Mr. Gittes...

GITTES

Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be

the problem?

MRS. MULWRAY

My husband, I believe, is seeing

another woman.

GITTES

(gravely)

No, really?

MRS. MULWRAY

I'm afraid so.

GITTES

I am sorry.

MRS. MULWRAY

Can't we talk about this alone, Mr.

Gittes?

GITTES

I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These

men are my operatives and at some

point they're going to assist me. I

can't do everything myself.

MRS. MULWRAY

Of course not.

GITTES

Now, what makes you certain he is

involved with someone?

MRS. MULWRAY

A wife can tell.

GITTES

Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your

husband?

MRS. MULWRAY

(shocked)

...Yes of course.

GITTES

(deliberately)

Then go home and forget about it.

MRS. MULWRAY

But...

GITTES

(staring intently at

her)

I'm sure he loves you, too. You know

the expression, let sleeping dogs

lie? You're better off not knowing.

MRS. MULWRAY

(with some real anxiety)

But I have to know.

GITTES

All right, what's your husband's

first name?

MRS. MULWRAY

Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

GITTES

(visibly surprised)

Water and Power?

her handbag, shoes, etc.

MRS. MULWRAY

He's the Chief Engineer.

DUFFY

(a little eagerly)

Chief Engineer?

GITTES

(confidentially)

This type of investigation can be

hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray.

It takes time.

MRS. MULWRAY

Money doesn't matter to me, Mr.

Gittes.

GITTES

Very well. We'll see what we can do.

"PROPOSED ALTO VALLEJO DAM AND RESERVOIR"

BAGBY

Gentlemen, today you can walk out

that door, turn right, hop on a

streetcar and in twenty-five minutes

end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.

Now you can swim in it, you can fish

in it, you can sail in it but you

can't drink it, you can't water your

lawns with it, you can't irrigate an

orange grove with it.  Remember we

live next door to the ocean but we

also live on the edge of the desert.

Los Angeles is a desert community.

Beneath this building, beneath every

street there's a desert. Without

water the dust will rise up and cover

us as though we'd never existed!

(pausing, letting the

implication sink in)

BAGBY (O.S.)

(continuing)

The Alto Vallejo can save us from

that, and I respectfully suggest

that eight and a half million dollars

is a fair price to pay to keep the

desert from our streets and not on

top of them.

COUNCILMAN

(acknowledging Bagby)

Mayor Bagby... let's hear from the

departments again. I suppose we better

take Water and Power first. Mr.

Mulwray.

MULWRAY

In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,

over five hundred lives were lost

when the Van der Lip Dam gave way

core samples have shown that beneath

this bedrock is shale similar to the

permeable shale in the Van der Lip

disaster.  It couldn't withstand

that kind of pressure there.

(referring to a new

overleaf)

Now you propose yet another dirt

banked terminus dam with slopes of

two and one half to one, one hundred

twelve feet high and a twelve thousand

acre water surface. Well, it won't

hold. I won't build it. It's that

simple. I am not making that kind of

mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen.

COUNCIL PRESIDENT

(shouting to farmer)

What in the hell do you think you're

doing?

(as the sheep bleat

down the aisles toward

the Council)

Get those goddam things out of here!

FARMER

(right back)

Tell me where to take them! You don't

have an answer for that so quick, do

you?

FARMER

(through above, to

Mulwray)

You steal the water from the valley,

ruin the grazing, starve my livestock

who's paying you to do that, Mr.

Mulwray, that's what I want to know!

GITTES

Morning, Sophie.

GITTES

Walsh here?

SOPHIE

He's in the dark room.

GITTES

Where'd he go yesterday?

WALSH'S VOICE

Three reservoirs. Men's room of a

Richfield gas station on Flower, and

the Pig 'n Whistle.

GITTES

Jesus Christ, this guy's really got

water on the brain.

WALSH'S VOICE

What'd you expect? That's his job.

GITTES

Listen, we can't string this broad

out indefinitely we got to come up

with something.

WALSH'S VOICE

I think I got something.

GITTES

Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?

WALSH'S VOICE

It's on your desk. Say, you hear the

one about the guy who goes to the

North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking

for penguins?

GITTES

He was there all night.

GITTES

(continuing; eagerly)

So what you got?

GITTES

(continuing; obviously

annoyed)

This?

WALSH

They got into a terrific argument

outside the Pig 'n Whistle.

GITTES

What about?

WALSH

I don't know. The traffic was pretty

loud. I only heard one thing  apple

core.

GITTES

Apple core?

WALSH

(shrugs)

Yeah.

GITTES

Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you

spent your day doing?

WALSH

Look, you tell me to take pictures,

I take pictures.

GITTES

Let me explain something to you,

Walsh. This business requires a

certain finesse.

GITTES

Yeah, Sophie?

(he picks up the phone)

Duffy, where are you?

GITTES

(continuing)

Okay, slow down  Echo Park.

(to Walsh)

Jesus, water again.

GITTES

(to Duffy, as they

pass)

Let's have a big smile, pal.

"EL MACANDO APARTMENTS"

BARNEY

(to Gittes)

When you get so much publicity, after

a while you must get blase about it.

BARNEY

(continuing)

Face it. You're practically a movie

star.

GITTES

(laughing)

Look at that.

BARNEY

Heat's murder.

OTHER CUSTOMER

(end of conversation)

Fools names and fools faces...

GITTES

(smiling; to Other

Customer)

What's that, pal?

OTHER CUSTOMER

(indicating paper)

Nothing. You got a hell of a way to

make a living.

GITTES

Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?

OTHER CUSTOMER

Mortgage Department, First National

Bank.

GITTES

Tell me, how many people a week do

you foreclose on?

OTHER CUSTOMER

We don't publish a record in the

paper, I can tell you that.

GITTES

Neither do I.

OTHER CUSTOMER

No, you have a press agent do it.

GITTES

Barney, who is this bimbo? He a

regular customer?

BARNEY

Take it easy, Jake.

GITTES

Look, pal. I make an honest living.

People don't come to me unless they're

miserable and I help 'em out of a

bad situation. I don't kick them out

of their homes like you jerks who

work in the bank.

BARNEY

Jake, for Christ's sake.

GITTES

C'mon, get out of the barber chair.

We'll go outside and talk this over.

BARNEY

Hey, c'mon, Jake. Sit down. Sit down.

You hear about the fella goes to his

friend and says, 'What'll I do, I'm

tired of screwing my wife?' and his

friend says, 'Whyn't you do what the

Chinese do?'

GITTES

I don't know how that got in the

paper as a matter of fact  it

surprised me it was so quick. I make

an honest living.

BARNEY

'Course you do, Jake.

GITTES

An honest living.

BARNEY

(continuing)

So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do

what the Chinese do?'

GITTES

Duffy, Walsh.

GITTES

(continuing)

Sophie, go to the little girl's room

for a minute.

SOPHIE

But, Mr. Gittes.

GITTES

(insisting)

Sophie.

SOPHIE

Yes, Mr. Gittes.

GITTES

So there's this fella who's tired of

screwing his wife.

DUFFY

Jake, listen.

GITTES

Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a

hurry and his friend says why not do

what the Chinese do? So he says what

do they do? His friend says the

Chinese they screw for a while. Just

listen a second, Duffy...

GITTES

(continuing)

...and then they stop and they read

a little Confucius and they screw

some more and they stop and they

smoke some opium and then they go

back and screw some more and they

stop again and they contemplate the

moon or something and it makes it

more exciting. So this other guy

goes home to screw his wife and after

a while he stops and gets up and

goes into the other room only he

reads Life Magazine and he goes back

and he screws some more and suddenly

says excuse me a second and he gets

up and smokes a cigarette and he

goes back and by this time his wife

is getting sore as hell. So he screws

some more and then he gets up to

look at the moon and his wife says,

'What the hell do you think you're

doing?

(Gittes breaks up)

...you're screwing like a Chinaman.'

YOUNG WOMAN

Mr. Gittes?

GITTES

Yes?

YOUNG WOMAN

Do you know me?

GITTES

Well... I think I... I would've

remembered.

YOUNG WOMAN

Have we ever met?

GITTES

Well, no.

YOUNG WOMAN

Never?

GITTES

Never.

YOUNG WOMAN

That's what I thought. You see, I'm

Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr.

Mulwray's wife.

GITTES

Not that Mulwray?

EVELYN

Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And

since you agree with me we've never

met, you must also agree that I

haven't hired you to do anything.

Certainly not spy on my husband. I

see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.

Well, you're going to get it.

GITTES

Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...

GITTES

(continuing)

...there's some misunderstanding

here. It's not going to do any good

to get tough with me.

EVELYN

I don't get tough with anybody, Mr.

Gittes.  My lawyer does.

GRAY-HAIRED MAN

Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.

GRAY-HAIRED MAN

(continuing; pleasantly)

I suppose we'll be hearing from your

attorney.

GITTES

(to Duffy)

There's seven ashtrays in this room,

Duffy.

DUFFY

Okay.

GITTES

That's a filthy habit.

DUFFY

I said okay, Jake.

GITTES

Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here

saying she was Shirley Temple you'd

say okay to that, too.

WALSH

Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's

real phone number and address.

GITTES

All she needed for that was the phone

book!

WALSH

No, no. She said not to call, her

husband might answer.

GITTES

When I find out who that phony bitch

was.

GITTES

Sophie.

SOPHIE

Yes, Mr. Gittes.

GITTES

Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.

(as he waits)

And how about that snotty broad?

(the phone to his ear)

What does she think, she's perfect?

Coming in waving her lawyers and her

money at me  so goddam smug. She's

no better than anybody else in this

town.

GITTES

(continuing)

Whitey, what's new, pal?... Yeah,

listen, where did you get those

photographs... Yeah, blowing a fuse

over the El Macando love nest.  That's

cute, Whitey... so who sent them to

you... I sent them?

(Gittes laughs a little

hysterically)

Why would I be asking how you got

them if I sent them?... Whitey?...

Whitey?... C'mon, level with me for

once, my tit's in the wringer and

it's beginning to hurt... yeah...

yeah... yeah.

WALSH

So he says you sent them?

GITTES

(after a moment)

They're all a bunch of phonies.

"HOLLIS J. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER"

GITTES

Mr. Mulwray, please.

SECRETARY

He's not in, Mr.?

GITTES

Gittes.

SECRETARY

May I ask what this is regarding?

GITTES

It's personal. Has he been out long?

SECRETARY

Since lunch.

GITTES

Gee whiz.

(he glances at his

watch)

And I'm late.

SECRETARY

He was expecting you?

GITTES

Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go

in and wait?

"Tues. night. Oak Pass Res. 7 channels used."

YELBURTON

Can I help you?

(extending his hand)

Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the

Department.

GITTES

(equally pleasant)

J.J. Gittes. And it's not a

departmental matter.

YELBURTON

I wonder if you'd care to wait in my

office?

YELBURTON

(continuing; as they're

going)

You see, this whole business in the

paper with Mr. Mulwray has us all on

edge.

YELBURTON

After all, you work with a man for a

certain length of time, you come to

know him, his habits, his values,

and so forth. Well either he's the

kind who chases after women or he

isn't.

GITTES

And Mulwray isn't?

YELBURTON

He never even kids about it.

GITTES

Maybe he takes it very seriously.

GITTES

You don't happen to know where Mr.

Mulwray's having lunch?

YELBURTON

I'm sorry, I --

GITTES

Well, tell him I'll be back.

GITTES

(continuing)

Mind if I take one of your cards?

In case I want to get in touch with

you again.

YELBURTON

Help yourself.

GITTES

Mulvihlll, what are you doing here?

MULVIHILL

They shut my water off, what's it to

you?

GITTES

How'd you find out? You don't drink

it, you don't take a bath in it,

maybe they sent you a letter. Ah,

but then you'd have to be able to

read.

GITTES

(continuing)

Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.

(to Yelburton)

Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?

YELBURTON

Hope so. He's working for us.

GITTES

J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

CHINESE BUTLER

Please.

CHINESE BUTLER

You wait, please.

GARDENER

(to Gittes)

Bad for glass.

GITTES

(not understanding)

Yeah sure. Bad for glass.

EVELYN

Yes, Mr. Gittes?

GITTES

Actually, I'm here to see your

husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

EVELYN

Would you like something to drink?

GITTES

What are you having?

EVELYN

Iced tea.

GITTES

Yeah. Fine, thank you.

EVELYN

My husband's at the office.

GITTES

Actually he's not. And he's moved

from his apartment at the El Macando.

EVELYN

(sharply)

That's not his apartment.

GITTES

Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs.

Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be

loved, but I am in business, and

believe me, whoever set up your

husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small

town, people talk.

GITTES

(continuing; uneasily)

I'm just trying to make a living,

and I don't want to become a local

Joke.

EVELYN

Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into

it. I'll drop the lawsuit.

GITTES

What?

EVELYN

I said I'll drop it.

EVELYN

(continuing; pleasantly)

So let's just drop the whole thing.

Sugar?  Lemon?

GITTES

Mrs. Mulwray?

EVELYN

(as she's mixing one

of the drinks)

Yes, Mr. Gittes?

GITTES

I don't want to drop it.

GITTES

I should talk this over with your

husband.

EVELYN

(a little concerned)

Why?... What on earth for?  Look,

Hollis seems to think you're an

innocent man.

GITTES

Well, I've been accused of many

things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.

GITTES

(continuing)

You see, somebody went to a lot of

trouble here, and I want to find

out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not

the one who's supposed to be caught

with my pants down... so I'd like to

see your husband. Unless that's a

problem.

EVELYN

(with a slight edge)

What do you mean?

GITTES

May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?

EVELYN

You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

GITTES

(determined to be

polite)

Well, that little girlfriend, she

was attractive in a cheap sort of

way of course.  She's disappeared.

Maybe they disappeared together

somewhere.

EVELYN

(with rising anger)

Suppose they did. How does it concern

you?

GITTES

Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I

just --

EVELYN

It's very personal. It couldn't be

more personal. Is this a business or

an obsession with you?

GITTES

Look at it this way. Now this phony

broad, excuse the language, says

she's you, she's hired me. Whoever

put her up to it, didn't have anything

against me. They were out to get

your husband. Now if I see him, I

can help him.  Did you talk this

morning?

EVELYN

No. I went riding rather early.

GITTES

Looks like you went quite a distance.

EVELYN

No, Just riding bareback, that's

all. Anyway, you might try the Oak

Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs.

Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks

around them. Otherwise he'll be home

by 6:30.

GITTES

I'll stop by.

EVELYN

Please call first.

GUARD

Sorry, this is closed to the public,

sir.

GITTES

(to the Guard)

It's all right. Russ Yelburton, Deputy

Chief in the Department.

GUARD

Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.

LOACH

Gittes, for Chrissakes.

GITTES

Loach.

LOACH

(moving to Gittes,

taking him by the

arm)

C'mon, get out of here before --

GITTES

Before what? What the hell's going

on?

ESCOBAR

Hello, Jake.

GITTES

(without smiling)

How are you, Lou?

ESCOBAR

I have a cold I can't seem to shake

but other than that, I'm fine.

GITTES

Summer colds are the worst.

ESCOBAR

Yeah, they are.

A FIREMAN

No smoking, sir. It's a fire hazard

this time of year.

ESCOBAR

I think we can make an exception.

I'll see he's careful with the

matches.

GITTES

(lighting up)

Thanks, Lou.

ESCOBAR

How'd you get past the guards?

GITTES

Well, to tell you the truth, I lied

a little.

ESCOBAR

You've done well by yourself.

GITTES

I get by.

ESCOBAR

Well, sometimes it takes a while for

a man to find himself and I guess

you have.

LOACH

Poking around in other people's dirty

linen.

GITTES

Yeah. Tell me, you still throw

Chinamen into jail for spitting on

the laundry?

ESCOBAR

You're behind the times, Jake. They've

got steam irons now.

(smiles)

And I'm out of Chinatown.

GITTES

Since when?

ESCOBAR

Since I made Lieutenant.

GITTES

Congratulations.

ESCOBAR

Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?

GITTES

Looking for someone.

ESCOBAR

Who?

GITTES

Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

ESCOBAR

Oh yes.

GITTES

I'd like to talk to him.

ESCOBAR

You're welcome to try. There he is.

ESCOBAR

It looks like he was washed the entire

length of the runoff channel. Could

he swim?

EVELYN

Of course.

ESCOBAR

Obviously the fall must have knocked

him out.

ESCOBAR

(continuing)

This alleged affair he was having.

The publicity didn't make him morose

or unhappy?

EVELYN

...Well, it didn't make him happy...

ESCOBAR

But there is no possibility he would

have taken his own life?

EVELYN

(sharply)

No.

ESCOBAR

(a little uncomfortably

now)

Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know

the name of the young woman in

question?

EVELYN

No.

ESCOBAR

Do you know where she might be?

EVELYN

Certainly not!

ESCOBAR

You and your husband never discussed

her?

EVELYN

(stopping, faltering)

He... we did... he wouldn't tell me

her name.  We quarreled over her...

of course. It came as a complete

surprise to me.

ESCOBAR

A complete surprise?

EVELYN

Yes.

ESCOBAR

But I thought you'd hired a private

investigator.

EVELYN

A private investigator?

ESCOBAR

(gesturing vaguely

toward the door)

Mr. Gittes.

EVELYN

Well yes.

EVELYN

(her eyes on Gittes)

But I... I... did that because I

thought it was a nasty rumor I'd put

an end to...

ESCOBAR

And when did Mr. Gittes inform you

that these rumors had some foundation

in fact?

GITTES

(smoothly)

Just before the story broke in the

papers, Lou.

ESCOBAR

You wouldn't happen to know the

present whereabouts of the young

woman.

GITTES

No.

ESCOBAR

Or her name?

GITTES

No.

EVELYN

Will you need me for anything else,

Lieutenant?

ESCOBAR

I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of

course you have my deepest sympathy

and if we need anymore information,

we'll be in touch.

GITTES

I'll walk her to her car, be right

back.

GITTES

Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.

EVELYN

(flushed, perspiring)

...Just a minute...

GITTES

(touching her gently)

You left your keys in the ignition.

EVELYN

Oh... thank you.

EVELYN

(continuing)

Thank you for going along with me. I

just didn't want to explain

anything... I'll send you a check.

GITTES

(puzzled)

A check?

EVELYN

To make it official, I hired you.

GITTES

Don't give me that, Lou. You hauled

me down here for a statement.

ESCOBAR

I don't want it anymore.

GITTES

No?

ESCOBAR

No. It was an accident.

GITTES

You mean that's what you're going to

call it.

ESCOBAR

That's right.

(contemptuously)

Out of respect for his civic position.

GITTES

What'd he do, Lou, make a pass at

your sister?

ESCOBAR

No, he drowned a cousin of mine with

about five hundred other people. But

they weren't very important, just a

bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a

dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't

come out of this smelling like a

rose, you know.

GITTES

Oh yeah? Can you think of something

to charge me with?

ESCOBAR

When I do, you'll hear about it.

MORTY

(a cigarette dangling

out of his mouth)

Jake, what're you doin' here?

GITTES

Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour,

I thought I'd drop by and see who

died lately.

MORTY

Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle

of a drought, the water commissioner

drowns. Only in L.A.

GITTES

(looking at. Mulwray)

Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.

MORTY

That's a long fall.

GITTES

So how are you, Morty?

MORTY

Never better. You know me, Jake.

GITTES

(picking up on cough)

Yeah, so who you got there?

MORTY

Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk used to

hang around Ferguson's Alley.

MORTY

(continuing)

Quite a character. Lately he'd been

living in one of the downtown storm

drains. Had a bureau dresser down

there and everything.

GITTES

Yeah.

MORTY

Drowned, too.

GITTES

Come again?

MORTY

Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in

the bottom of the riverbed.

GITTES

The L.A. River?

MORTY

(a little puzzled)

Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's

wrong with that?

GITTES

It's bone dry, Morty.

MORTY

It's not completely dry.

GITTES

Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a

damp riverbed either, I don't care

how soused he was. That's like

drowning in a teaspoon.

MORTY

We got water out of him, Jake. He

drowned.

GITTES

Jesus, this town...

GITTES

(calling out to him)

You were riding here the other day,

weren't you...?

GITTES

(continuing)

Speak English?... Habla Ingles?

THE BOY

(finally)

Si.

GITTES

Didn't you talk to a man here... few

days ago... wore glasses... he...

GITTES

(continuing)

What did you talk about, mind my

asking?

THE BOY

(finally)

The water.

GITTES

What about the water?

THE BOY

When it comes.

GITTES

When it comes? What'd you tell him?

THE BOY

Comes in different parts of the river.

Every night a different part.

GITTES

(grumbling)

Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.

SMALLER MAN

(shaking with emotion)

Hold it there, kitty cat.

THE SMALLER MAN

You are a very nosey fellow, kitty

cat... you know what happens to nosey

fellows?

SMALLER MAN

(continuing)

Wanna guess? No? Okay, lose their

noses.

THE SMALLER MAN

(continuing)

Next time you lose the whole thing,

kitty cat. I'll cut it off and feed

it to my goldfish, understand?

MULVIHILL

Tell him you understand, Gittes.

GITTES

(mumbling)

I understand...

GITTES

(pressing down intercom)

Yeah, Sophie.

SOPHIE'S VOICE

A Miss Sessions calling.

GITTES

Who?

SOPHIE'S VOICE

Ida Sessions.

GITTES

Don't know her. Take a number.

WALSH

So some contractor wants to build a

dam and he makes a few payoffs. So

what?

WALSH

(continuing)

Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll

claim you were trespassing.

GITTES

I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the

big boys that are making the payoffs.

DUFFY

Then what'll you do?

GITTES

Sue the shit out of 'em.

WALSH

Yeah?

GITTES

Yeah. What's wrong with you guys?

Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em.

We'll make a killing.

(a dazzling smile)

We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice

a week, we'll be pissing on ice the

rest of our lives.

WALSH

Sue people like that they're liable

to be having dinner with the Judge

who's trying the suit.

SOPHIE'S VOICE

Miss Ida Sessions again. She says

you know her.

GITTES

Okay.

GITTES

(continuing)

Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe

we've had the pleasure.

IDA'S VOICE

Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr.

Gittes?

GITTES

(clowning a little

for the boys)

Isn't everybody? What can I do for

you, Miss Sessions?

IDA'S VOICE

Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes.

I didn't come in to see you on my

own.

GITTES

When did you come in?

IDA'S VOICE

I was the one who pretended to be

Mrs. Mulwray, remember?

GITTES

(to Duffy and Walsh)

Shut the fuck up!

(then back to Ida)

...Yes I remember nothing, Miss

Sessions, just going over a detail

or two with my associates... you

were saying?

IDA'S VOICE

Well I never expected anything to

happen like what happened to Mr.

Mulwray, the point is if it ever

comes out I want somebody to know I

didn't know what would happen.

GITTES

I understand... if you could tell me

who employed you, Miss Sessions.

That could help us both.

IDA'S VOICE

Oh no.

GITTES

...Why don't you give me your address

and we can talk this over?

IDA'S VOICE

No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the

obituary column of today's Times...

GITTES

The obituary column?

IDA'S VOICE

You'll find one of those people.

GITTES

'Those people?' Miss Sessions.

GITTES

Thanks for coming... drink?

EVELYN

Tom Collins with lime, not lemon,

please.

GITTES

I got your check in the mall.

EVELYN

Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.

GITTES

Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not

good enough.

EVELYN

(a little embarrassed)

Well, how much would you like?

GITTES

Stop it. The money's fine. It's

generous but you've shortchanged me

on the story.

EVELYN

(coolly)

I have?

GITTES

I think so. Something besides your

husband's death was bothering you.

You were upset but not that upset.

EVELYN

Mr. Gittes...

(icily)

Don't tell me how I feel.

GITTES

Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband

dies, you drop the lawsuit like a

hot potato, and all of it quicker

than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse

me. Then you ask me to lie to the

police.

EVELYN

It wasn't much of a lie.

GITTES

If your husband was killed it was.

(meaning check)

This can look like you paid me off

to withhold evidence.

EVELYN

But he wasn't killed.

GITTES

I think you're hiding something,

Mrs. Mulwray.

EVELYN

Well, I suppose I am... actually I

knew about the affair.

GITTES

How did you find out?

EVELYN

My husband.

GITTES

He told you?

GITTES

(continuing)

And you weren't the slightest bit

upset about it?

EVELYN

I was grateful.

GITTES

You'll have to explain that, Mrs.

Mulwray.

EVELYN

Why?

GITTES

(a flash of annoyance)

Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my

metiay.  When a wife tells me she's

happy her husband is cheating on her

it runs contrary to my experience.

EVELYN

Unless what?

GITTES

(looking directly at

her)

She's cheating on him.

GITTES

(continuing)

Were you?

EVELYN

I don't like the word 'cheat.'

GITTES

Did you have affairs?

EVELYN

(flashing)

Mr. Gittes.

GITTES

Did he know?

EVELYN

(almost an outburst)

Well I wouldn't run home and tell

him whenever I went to bed with

someone, if that's what you mean.

EVELYN

(continuing; more

calmly)

Is there anything else you want to

know?

GITTES

Where you were when your husband

died.

EVELYN

I can't tell you.

GITTES

You mean you don't know where you

were?

EVELYN

I mean I can't tell you.

GITTES

You were seeing someone, too.

GITTES

For very long?

EVELYN

I don't see anyone for very long,

Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me.

Now I think you know all you need to

about me. I didn't want publicity. I

didn't want to go into any of this,

then or now. Is this all?

GITTES

Oh, by the way. What's the 'C' stand

for?

EVELYN

(she stammers slightly)

K... Cross.

GITTES

That your maiden name?

EVELYN

Yes... why?

GITTES

No reason.

EVELYN

You must've had a reason to ask me

that.

GITTES

(shrugs)

No. I'm just a snoop.

EVELYN

You seem to have had a reason for

every other question.

GITTES

No, not for that one.

EVELYN

I don't believe you.

GITTES

(moving in)

Do me a favor. Sit still and act

like I'm charming.

GITTES

(continuing)

There's somebody here. Say something.

Anything. Something like we're being

intimate.

EVELYN

(meaning his nose)

How did it happen?

GITTES

(quietly)

Been meaning to talk to you about

that.

EVELYN

(quietly)

Maybe putting your nose in other

people's business?

GITTES

(quietly)

More like other people putting their

business in my nose.

WOMAN'S VOICE

You son of a bitch.

GITTES

Mrs. Match. How're you?

MRS. MATCH

Don't give me that, you son of a

bitch.

GITTES

Okay.

EVELYN

(softly)

Another satisfied client?

GITTES

Another satisfied client's wife.

MRS. MATCH

Look at me, you son of a bitch. You...

you bastard. Are you happy, are you

happy now?

MRS. MATCH

You smug son of a bitch. My husband's

so upset he sweats all night! How do

you think that makes me feel?

GITTES

Sweaty?

GITTES

Let's get out of here before she

picks up her purse.

EVELYN

(quietly)

Tough guy, huh?

EVELYN

Oh, no. I've got my own car. The

creamcolored Packard.

GITTES

(to attendant who

dutifully starts for

her car)

Wait a minute, sonny.

(to Evelyn)

I think you better come with me.

EVELYN

What for? There's nothing more to

say.

(to attendant)

Get my car, please.

GITTES

Okay, go home. But in case you're

interested your husband was murdered.

Somebody's dumping tons of water out

of the city reservoirs when we're

supposedly in the middle of a drought,

he found out, and he was killed.

There's a waterlogged drunk in the

morgue. Involuntary manslaughter if

anybody wants to take the trouble

which they don't. It looks like half

the city is trying to cover it all

up, which is fine with me. But, Mrs.

Mulwray.

(now inches from her)

I goddam near lost my nose! And I

like it. I like breathing through

it. And I still think you're hiding

something.

EVELYN

Mr. Gittes.

"HOLLIS I. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER"

GITTES

J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

SECRETARY

Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some

time.

GITTES

Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.

SECRETARY

He's liable to be tied up

indefinitely.

GITTES

I take a long lunch. All day

sometimes.

GITTES

Julian Cross worked for the water

department?

SECRETARY

(looking up)

Yes. No.

GITTES

(humming, then)

He did or he didn't?

SECRETARY

He owned it.

GITTES

He owned the water department?

SECRETARY

Yes.

GITTES

He owned the entire water supply for

the city?

SECRETARY

Yes.

GITTES

(really surprised)

How did they get it away from him?

SECRETARY

(a sigh, then)

Mr. Mulwray felt the public should

own the display. The water. If you'll

just read the display.

GITTES

(glances back, hums,

then)

Mulwray? I thought you said Cross

owned the department.

SECRETARY

Along with Mr. Mulwray.

GITTES

They were partners.

SECRETARY

(testily)

Yes. Yes, they were partners.

SECRETARY

(to Gittes)

Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

YELBURTON

Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.

These staff meetings, they just go

on and on.

GITTES

Yeah, must be especially tough to

take over under these circumstances.

YELBURTON

Oh yes. Hollis was the best department

head the city's ever had. My goodness,

what happened to your nose?

GITTES

(smiles)

I cut myself shaving.

YELBURTON

You ought to be more careful. That

must really smart.

GITTES

Only when I breathe.

YELBURTON

(laughing)

Only when you breathe... don't tell

me you're still working for Mrs.

Mulwray?

GITTES

I never was.

YELBURTON

(stops smiling)

I don't understand.

GITTES

Neither do I, actually. But you hired

me or you hired that chippie to hire

me.

YELBURTON

Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit

of sense.

GITTES

Well, look at it this way, Mr.

Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to

build a dam and he had a reputation

that was hard to get around, so.

you decided to ruin it. Then he found

out that you were dumping water every

night. Then he was drowned.

YELBURTON

Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous

accusation.  I don't know what you're

talking about.

GITTES

Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the

Times will. Dumping thousands of

gallons of water down the toilet in

the middle of a drought.  That's

news.

YELBURTON

Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes.

We're... well, we're not anxious for

this to get around, but we have been

diverting a little water to irrigate

avocado and walnut groves in the

northwest valley. As you know, the

farmers there have no legal right to

our water, and since the drought

we've had to cut them off. The city

comes first, naturally.  But, well,

we've been trying to help some of

them out, keep them from going under.

Naturally when you divert water you

get a little runoff.

GITTES

Yeah, a little runoff. Where are

those orchards?

YELBURTON

I said, the northwest valley.

GITTES

That's like saying they're in Arizona.

YELBURTON

Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and

I can't give you an exact location...

GITTES

You're a married man, am I right?

YELBURTON

Yes...

GITTES

Hard working, have a wife and kids...

YELBURTON

Yes...

GITTES

I don't want to nail you. I just

want to know who put you up to it.

I'll give you a few days to think it

over.

(hands him a card)

Call me. I can help. Who knows?

Maybe we can lay the whole thing off

on a few big shots and you can stay

head of the department for the next

twenty years.

EVELYN

What's your usual salary?

GITTES

Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty

for each of my operators, plus

expenses, plus my fee if I show

results.

EVELYN

Whoever's behind my husband's death,

why have they gone to all this

trouble?

GITTES

Money. How they plan to make it by

emptying the reservoirs, that I don't

know.

EVELYN

I'll pay your salary plus five

thousand dollars if you find out

what happened to Hollis and who is

involved.

GITTES

Sophie, draw up one of our standard

forms for Mrs. Mulwray.

(he leans back; to

Evelyn)

Tell me, did you get married before

or after Mulwray and your father

sold the water department?

GITTES

(continuing)

Your father is Julian Cross, isn't

he?

EVELYN

Yes, of course. It was quite a while

after. I was just out of grade school

when they did that.

GITTES

So you married your father's business

partner?

GITTES

(continuing; staring

at her, points to

the ashtray)

You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.

EVELYN

Oh.

GITTES

Is there something upsetting about

my asking about your father?

EVELYN

No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis

and my fa... my father had a falling

out...

GITTES

Over the water department, or over

you?

EVELYN

(quickly)

Not over me. Why would they have a

falling out over me?

GITTES

(noting her nervousness)

Then it was over the water department.

EVELYN

Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes

and no.  Hollis felt the public should

own the water but I don't think my

father felt that way.  Actually, it

was over the Van der Lip. The dam

that broke.

GITTES

Oh, yeah?

EVELYN

Yes. He never forgave him for it.

GITTES

Never forgave him for what?

EVELYN

For talking him into building it, he

never forgave my father... They

haven't spoken to this day.

GITTES

(starts a little)

You sure shout that?

EVELYN

Of course I'm sure.

GITTES

What about you? Do you and your father

get along?

GITTES

Sign here... The other copy's for

you.

EVELYN

What are you thinking?

GITTES

(picking up one of

copies, folding it,

putting it in his

pocket)

Before this I turned on the faucet,

it came out hot and cold, I didn't

think there was a thing to it.

GITTES

(above the engines)

What?

OLD MAN

You'll have to sit with the pilot.

PILOT

(above the engines)

Well, you're not going fishing.

GITTES

Not exactly.

PILOT

(winks)

But that's what you told your wife.

PILOT

Lots of fellas do. Tell the little

woman they're going on a fishing

trip, then shack up with some little

twist on the island... she pretty?

GITTES

(abruptly)

I'm going to see a man called Julian

Cross. Ever heard of him?

PILOT

Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you,

mister?... I ask because he doesn't

see a whole lot of people.

GITTES

I'm working for his daughter.

PILOT

(surprised)

That right?... She used to be some

looker.

GITTES

She ain't exactly long in the tooth

now.

PILOT

She must be about thirty-three, thirty-

four.

GITTES

You must be thinking of a different

daughter.

PILOT

No, he's only got one, I remember

her age, I read it in the newspapers

when she ran away.

GITTES

She ran away?

PILOT

Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the

time. Julian Cross' daughter. God

almighty. She was a wild little thing.

PILOT

(continuing)

Course, she settled down nicely.

GITTES

(smiling a little)

Well, you never know, do you?

PILOT

(loosening up)

That's for sure.

GITTES

Why'd she run away?

PILOT

Oh, you know. She was sixteen or

seventeen.

GITTES

(nudging him)

We missed the best of it, didn't we,

pal?

PILOT

She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she

was knocked up and didn't even know

who the father was. Went there to

get rid of it.

GITTES

You don't say?

PILOT

Cross was looking for her all over

the country. Offered rewards,

everything. Felt real sorry for him,

with all his money.

CROSS

Horseshit.

GITTES

Sir?

CROSS

I said horseshit.

(pointing)

Horseshit.

GITTES

Yes, sir, that's what it looks like.

I'll give you that.

CROSS

Love the smell of it. A lot of people

do but of course they won't admit

it. Look at the shape.

CROSS

(continuing; smiling,

almost enthusiastic)

Always the same.

GITTES

(not one to let it go)

Always?

CROSS

What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the

animal's sick or something.

(stops and glances.

back)

And the steam rising off it like

that in the morning. That's life,

Mr. Gittes. Life.

CROSS

(continuing)

Perhaps this preoccupation with

horseshit may seem a little perverse,

but I ask you to remember this. One

way or another, it's what I've dealt

in all my life. Let's have breakfast.

CROSS

You know, you've got a nasty

reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.

GITTES

(dubious)

Thanks.

CROSS

If you were a bank president that

would be one thing, but in your

business it's admirable. And it's

good advertising.

GITTES

It doesn't hurt.

CROSS

It's why you attract a client like

my daughter.

GITTES

Probably.

CROSS

But I'm surprised you're still working

for her, unless she's suddenly come

up with another husband.

GITTES

No. She happens to think the last

one was murdered.

CROSS

How did she get that idea?

GITTES

I think I gave it to her.

CROSS

Uh-huh. Oh I hope you don't mind. I

believe they should be served with

the head.

GITTES

Fine, as long as you don't serve

chicken that way.

CROSS

(laughs)

Tell me. What do the police say?

GITTES

They're calling it an accident.

CROSS

Who's the investigating officer?

GITTES

Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.

CROSS

Do you know him?

GITTES

Oh yes.

CROSS

Where from?

GITTES

We worked in Chinatown together.

CROSS

Would you call him a capable man?

GITTES

Very.

CROSS

Honest?

GITTES

Far as it goes. Of course he has to

swim in the same water we all do.

CROSS

Of course, but you've got no reason

to think he's bungled the case?

GITTES

None.

CROSS

That's too bad.

GITTES

Too bad?

CROSS

It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes

me think you're taking my daughter

for a ride. Financially speaking, of

course. How much are you charging

her?

GITTES

(carefully)

My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come

up with any results.

CROSS

Are you sleeping with her? Come,

come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to

think about that to remember, do

you?

GITTES

If you want an answer to that question

I can always put one of my men on

the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.

CROSS

Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a

disturbed woman who's lost her

husband. I don't want her taken

advantage of. Sit down.

GITTES

What for?

CROSS

You may think you know what you're

dealing with, but believe me, you

don't.

CROSS

Why is that funny?

GITTES

It's what the D.A. used to tell me

about Chinatown.

CROSS

Was he right?

CROSS

(continuing)

...Exactly what do you know about

me, Mr. Gittes?

GITTES

Mainly that you're rich and too

respectable to want your name in the

papers.

CROSS

(grunts, then)

'Course I'm respectable. I'm old.

Politicians, ugly buildings and whores

all get respectable if they last

long enough. I'll double whatever

your fees are and I'll pay you ten

thousand dollars if you can find

Hollis' girlfriend.

GITTES

His girlfriend?

CROSS

Yes, his girlfriend.

GITTES

You mean the little chippie he was

with at the El Macando?

CROSS

Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?

GITTES

Yeah.

CROSS

Doesn't that strike you as odd?

GITTES

No. She's probably scared to death.

CROSS

Wouldn't it be useful to talk to

her?

GITTES

Maybe.

CROSS

If Mulwray was murdered, she was

probably one of the last people to

see him.

GITTES

You didn't see Mulwray much, did

you?

CROSS

No.

GITTES

When was the last time?

CROSS

Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of

damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to

the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em

practice up out here.

GITTES

Yeah. Do you remember the last time

you talked to Mulwray?

CROSS

At my age, you tend to lose track...

GITTES

Well, It was about five days ago.

You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle

and you had one hell of an argument.

GITTES

(continuing)

I've got the photographs in my office.

If they'll help you remember. What

was the argument about?

CROSS

(a long pause, then:)

My daughter.

GITTES

What about her?

CROSS

Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I

think she is frightened and I happen

to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd

like to help her if I can.

GITTES

I didn't realize you and Hollis were

so fond of each other.

CROSS

Hollis Mulwray made this city and he

made me a fortune... We were a lot

closer than Evelyn realized.

GITTES

If you want to hire me, I still have

to know what you and Mulwray were

arguing about.

CROSS

(painfully)

Well... she's an extremely jealous

person. I didn't want her to find

out about the girl.

GITTES

How did you find out?

CROSS

I've still got a few teeth in my

head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends

in town.

GITTES

Okay. My secretary'll send you a

letter of agreement. Tell me are you

worried about that girl, or what

Evelyn might do to her?

CROSS

Just find the girl.

GITTES

I'll look into it as soon as I check

out some avocado groves.

CROSS

Avocado groves?

GITTES

We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

GITTES

I'm a little lost. Where can I find

the plat books for the northwest

valley?

CLERK

Part of it's in Ventura County. We

don't have Ventura County in our

Hall of Records.

GITTES

I'll settle for L.A. County.

CLERK

(regards him, then)

Row twenty-three, section C.

GITTES

Hauls the huge volume back to the

Clerk's desk.

GITTES

(to Clerk)

Say... uh... sonny.

GITTES

How come all these new names are

pasted into the plat book?

CLERK

Land sales out of escrow are always

recorded within the week.

GITTES

Then these are all new owners?

CLERK

That's right.

GITTES

(astonished)

But that means that most of the

valley's been sold in the last few

months.

CLERK

If that's what it says.

GITTES

Can I check one of these volumes

out?

CLERK

(quietly snotty)

Sir, this is not a lending library,

it's the Hall of Records.

GITTES

Well, then, how about a ruler?

CLERK

A ruler?

GITTES

The print's pretty fine. I forgot my

glasses. I'd like to be able to read

across.

GITTES

(to one of the Children)

Say, pal, what's he doing?

CHILD

Making some rain.

GITTES

Well, you're just the man I'm looking

for.

GITTES

Some associates and I are thinking

of buying property out here. Of

course, we're worried about the

rainfall.

RAINMAKER

No problem with me on the Job.

GITTES

Yeah.

(glancing around at

the desolate, dry

field)

Do you have any references?

RAINMAKER

City of La Habra Heights filled an

800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen

inches of rain in two days.

GITTES

(nods)

That's swell. But how about here?

(pulling out names

from his pocket)

Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma

Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons,

or Jasper Lamar Crabb?

RAINMAKER

Never heard of 'em... new owners?

GITTES

Yeah.

RAINMAKER

(climbing back up)

Lot of turnover these days. Better

tell them to get in touch with me if

they want to hang onto their land.

GITTES

Yeah, I'll do that.

RED FACED FARMER

All right, quit it! Quit now! Search

the man, see if he's armed.

RED FACED FARMER

I said see if he's armed, not empty

his pockets.

BIG FARMER

He ain't armed.

RED FACED FARMER

All right, mister. Who you with?

Water department or the real estate

office?

GITTES

(to Crippled Farmer)

Get away from me!

CRIPPLED FARMER

Answer him!

GITTES

Touch me with that thing again and

you'll need a pair of them.

BIG FARMER

(shoving Gittes)

Whyn't you pick on somebody your own

size?

RED FACED FARMER

I said cut that out! Give him a chance

to say something.

GITTES

(reaching down for

his wallet)

Name's Gittes. I'm a private

investigator and I'm not with either

one.

RED FACED FARMER

Then what are you doing out here?

GITTES

Client hired me to see... whether or

not the water department's been

irrigating your land.

RED FACED FARMER

Irrigating my land?

(exploding)

The water department's been sending

you people to blow up my water tanks!

They threw poison down three of my

wells! I call that a funny way to

irrigate. Who'd hire you for a thing

like that?

GITTES

Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

BIG FARMER

Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch

who's done it to us.

GITTES

Mulwray's dead. You don't know what

you're talking about, you dumb Oakie.

RED FACED FARMER

Well, that's that.

GITTES

(to Evelyn)

What's going on?

DUBOIS

(quietly, almost as

if he were in a

hospital)

You didn't look too good, so we

thought we better call your employer.

DUBOIS

Look here, if it's all the same with

you, we'll get your car patched up.

If you'll tell me what your trousers

run you, I'll make good on them, Mr.

Gittes.

GITTES

It's okay, Mr. Dubois.

DUBOIS,

(to Evelyn)

It's just that they're after everybody

out here, tearing up our irrigation

ditches trying to make our land

worthless so they can pick it up for

twenty-five dollars an acre.

DUBOIS

(continuing)

Anyway. Earl here is sorry, too. He

wants to give you something to take

back with you.

GITTES

Thanks, Earl.

GITTES

Thanks for coming...

GITTES

That dam is a con job.

EVELYN

What dam?

GITTES

The one your husband opposed. They're

conning L.A. into building it, only

the water won't go to L.A. It'll go

here.

EVELYN

The Valley?

GITTES

Everything you can see, everything

around us. I was at the Hall of

Records today.

(whips out papers,

turns on the car

light)

That bother you?

EVELYN

No.

GITTES

(looking over papers)

In the last three months, Robert

Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma

Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer

5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb

25,000 acres.

EVELYN

Jasper Lamar Crabb?

GITTES

Know him?

EVELYN

No, I think I'd remember.

GITTES

Yeah. They've been blowing these

farmers out of here and buying their

land for peanuts. Have any idea what

this land'll be worth with a steady

water supply? About thirty million

more than they paid.

EVELYN

And Hollis knew about it?

GITTES

It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar

Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.

GITTES

(continuing)

We got it. We got it, baby.

EVELYN

What? What is it?

GITTES

There was a memorial service at the

Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar

Crabb. He died three weeks ago.

EVELYN

Is that unusual?

GITTES

Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000

acres. That's unusual.

PALMER

Hello there, I'm Mr. Palmer. Can I

help you folks?

GITTES

Yes, I sure hope so. It's Dad.

(indicating his

disheveled appearance)

I just can't handle him anymore, can

I, sweetheart?

PALMER

Oh my goodness.

GITTES

(hastily)

Nothing to do with Dad. It's me,

actually.

EVELYN

They just don't get along very well.

Dad's a lamb with anyone else.

PALMER

(not so sure)

Oh, well, I don't know.

GITTES

Naturally, I want the best for him,

money is no object.

PALMER

Perhaps if we could meet your father.

GITTES

There's just one question.

PALMER

Of course.

GITTES

Do you accept anyone of the Jewish

persuasion?

PALMER

(very embarrassed)

I'm sorry. We don't.

GITTES

(smoothly)

Don't be sorry, neither does Dad.

Wanted to make sure though, didn't

we, honey?

GITTES

Just to be certain, I wonder if you

could show us a list of your patients?

PALMER

(polite but pointed)

We don't reveal the names of our

guests as a matter of policy. I know

you'd appreciate that if your father

came to live with us.

GITTES

(confidentially)

That's exactly what we wanted to

hear.

PALMER

Oh, good.

GITTES

I wonder, is it too late for us to

have a look around?

PALMER

I don't think so. Be happy to show

you.

GITTES

Would you mind if we took a stroll

on our own?

PALMER

Just, if you will, confine yourself

to the main building. It's nearly

bedtime.

GITTES

We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.

GITTES

(quietly)

They're all here. Every goddam name.

GITTES

(continuing; indicating

the ancients around

them)

You're looking at the owners of a

50,000 acre empire.

EVELYN

(astonished)

They can't be.

GITTES

They may not know it but they are.

GITTES

Hello, girls.

GITTES

(continuing)

Which one of you is Emma Dill?

GITTES

Are you Emma?

EMMA

Yes.

GITTES

I've been wanting to meet you.

EMMA

Why?

GITTES

Did you know that you're a very

wealthy woman?

EMMA

(stitching, smiles)

I'm not.

GITTES

Well you own a lot of land.

EMMA

Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my

late husband owned a good deal of

beach property in Long Beach, but we

lost it.

GITTES

That's just lovely.

EMMA

Thank you...

GITTES

(indicating tail)

Where did you get this material?

EMMA

(what it sounds like)

The apple core club.

GITTES

The apple core?

EMMA

No. The albacore. It's a fish. My

grandson's a member and they take

very nice care of us.

GITTES

How do they do that?

EMMA

Give us things. Not just some old

flag like this, but -

GITTES

(kneeling)

But what?

PALMER'S VOICE

We're a sort of unofficial charity

of theirs, Mr. Gittes. Would you

care to come this way? Someone wants

to see you.

GITTES

See you later, Emma.

MULVIHILL

Come on I want you to meet somebody,

Gittes.

GITTES

(glancing from Palmer

to Mulvihill)

Can we leave the lady out of this?

MULVIHILL

(a little uncertain)

Yeah, why not?

GITTES

Okay, I'd like to walk her to her

car.

EVELYN

I'll stay.

GITTES

(taking her by the

arm)

Get in the car.

MULVIHILL

I'll see she makes it.

GITTES

(as Mulvihill hits

the floor, to Evelyn)

What are you waiting for? Get in the

car!

EVELYN

Get in.

GITTES

(watching her pour)

Maid's night off?

EVELYN

Why?

GITTES

(a little surprised,

he laughs)

What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's

here, that's all.

EVELYN

(handing Gittes his

drink)

I gave everybody the night off.

GITTES

Easy, it's an innocent question.

EVELYN

No question from you is innocent,

Mr. Gittes.

GITTES

(laughing)

I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray.

Frankly you really saved my a... my

neck tonight.

EVELYN

Tell me something. Does this usually

happen to you, Mr. Gittes?

GITTES

What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?

EVELYN

Well, I'm only judging on the basis

of one afternoon and an evening, but

if that's how you go about your work,

I'd say you're lucky to get through

a whole day.

GITTES

(pouring himself

another drink)

Actually this hasn't happened to me

in some time.

EVELYN

When was the last time?

GITTES

Why?

EVELYN

Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.

GITTES

It was in Chinatown.

EVELYN

What were you doing there?

GITTES

(taking a long drink)

Working for the District Attorney.

EVELYN

Doing what?

GITTES

As little as possible.

EVELYN

The District Attorney gives his men

advice like that?

GITTES

They do in Chinatown.

EVELYN

Bothers you to talk about it, doesn't

it?

GITTES

No. I wonder... could I. Do you have

any peroxide or something?

EVELYN

Oh sure. C'mon.

EVELYN

Doctor did a nice job...

EVELYN

(continuing)

Boy oh boy, you're a mess.

GITTES

Yeah.

EVELYN

(working on him)

So why does it bother you to talk

about it... Chinatown...

GITTES

Bothers everybody who works there,

but to me... It was...

EVELYN

Hold still. Why?

GITTES

You can't always tell what's going

on there.

EVELYN

...No. Why was it.

GITTES

I thought I was keeping someone from

being hurt and actually I ended up

making sure they were hurt.

EVELYN

Could you do anything about it?

GITTES

Yeah. Make sure I don't find myself

in Chinatown anymore. Wait a second.

EVELYN

(momentarily freezing)

What's wrong?

GITTES

Your eye.

EVELYN

What about it?

GITTES

(staring intently)

There's something black in the green

part of your eye.

EVELYN

(not moving)

Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...

GITTES

...A flaw...

EVELYN

(she almost shivers)

...Yes, sort of a birthmark...

EVELYN

Hello...

(in Spanish now)

No, no, I'll come and help, just

keep watching her and don't do

anything until I get there... 'bye.

EVELYN

I have to go.

GITTES

Where?

EVELYN

Just... I have to.

GITTES

And I want to know where.

EVELYN

(she starts out of

bed)

Please don't be angry... believe me,

it's got nothing to do with you.

GITTES

(stopping her)

Where are you going?

EVELYN

(near tears)

Please!... Trust me this much...

(she kisses him lightly)

I'll be back. Look, there is something

I should tell you. The fishing club

that old lady mentioned, the pieces

off the flag.

GITTES

The Albacore Club.

EVELYN

It has to do with my father.

GITTES

I know.

EVELYN

He owns it. You know?

GITTES

I saw him.

EVELYN

(sitting up straight)

You saw my fa... father? When?

GITTES

This morning.

EVELYN

(panicked)

You didn't tell me.

GITTES

There hasn't been a lot of time.

EVELYN

What did he say?

(insistent)

What did he say?

GITTES

That you were jealous, and he was

worried about what you might do.

EVELYN

Do? To who?

GITTES

Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing.

He wanted to know where she was.

EVELYN

I want you to listen to me. My father

is a very dangerous man. You don't

know how dangerous. You don't know

how crazy.

GITTES

Give me an example.

EVELYN

You may think you know what's going

on, but you don't.

GITTES

That's what your father said. You're

telling me he's in back of this whole

thing?

EVELYN

It's possible.

GITTES

Including the death of your husband?

EVELYN

It's possible. Please don't ask me

any more questions now. Just wait,

wait for me. I'll be back. I need

you here.

GITTES

Okay, give me the keys.

EVELYN

(stunned, furious)

You bastard.

GITTES

It's either that or you drive to the

police yourself.

EVELYN

The police?

GITTES

C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your

husband's girlfriend tied up in there!

EVELYN

She's not tied up!

GITTES

You know what I mean. You're keeping

her there against her will.

EVELYN

I am not!

GITTES

Then let's go talk to her.

EVELYN

No!

EVELYN

(continuing)

She's too upset.

GITTES

What about?

EVELYN

Hollis' death. I tried to keep it

from her, I didn't want her upset

before I could make plans for her to

leave.

GITTES

You mean she just found out?

EVELYN

Yes.

GITTES

That's not what it looks like, Mrs.

Mulwray.

EVELYN

What does it look like?

GITTES

Like she knows about Hollis' death.

Like she knows more than you want

her to tell.

EVELYN

You're insane.

GITTES

Just tell me the truth. I'm not the

police. I don't care what you've

done. I'm not going to hurt you, but

one way or another I'm going to know.

EVELYN

You won't go to the police if I tell

you?

GITTES

I will if you don't.

EVELYN

She's my sister.

GITTES

Take it easy... If it's your sister

it's your sister... why all the

secrecy?

EVELYN

(really upset)

I can't...

GITTES

Because of Hollis? Because she was

seeing your husband? Was that it?

Jesus Christ, say something. Was

that it?

EVELYN

(finally)

I would never ever have harmed Hollis.

I loved him more than my own family.

He was the most gentle, decent man

imaginable... and he put up with

more from me than you'll ever know...

I just wanted him to be happy...

GITTES

(after a moment)

I took your husband's Buick...

(he opens the car

door)

I'll return it tomorrow.

EVELYN

Aren't you coming back with me?

GITTES

Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody

about this.

EVELYN

...That's not what I meant.

GITTES

(finally)

Yeah, well... I'm very tired, Mrs.

Mulwray. Good night.

VOICE ON PHONE

(male)

Gittes?... Gittes?

GITTES

Yeah.

VOICE ON PHONE

Ida Sessions wants to see you.

GITTES

Who?

VOICE 0N PHONE

Ida Sessions, you remember Ida.

GITTES

Yeah?... I do?

VOICE ON PHONE

Sure you do.

GITTES

Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida

wants to see me she can call me at

my office.

VOICE ON PHONE

684 1/2 East Tensington. Echo Park.

She begged me to call. She's waiting

for you.

ESCOBAR

Find anything interesting, Gittes?

ESCOBAR

What are you doing here?

GITTES

Didn't you call?

ESCOBAR

(jerk of his head

toward the kitchen)

How do you happen to know her?

GITTES

I don't.

ESCOBAR

(turning toward other

room)

Let me show you something.

ESCOBAR

Isn't that your number?

GITTES

Is it? I forget. I don't call myself

that often.

ESCOBAR

Just to be on the safe side, we had

Loach here give you a ring.

ESCOBAR'S ASSISTANT

(a slight sneer)

What happened to your nose, Gittes?

Somebody slam a bedroom window on

it?

GITTES

(right back, smiling)

Nope, your wife got excited, crossed

her legs a little too quick. You

understand, pal.

ESCOBAR

(to other Assistant)

Loach.

(Escobar pulls out a

drawer)

How about these? Look familiar?

GITTES

(no point in denying

it)

Yeah, I took 'em. So what?

ESCOBAR

How did she...

(meaning the corpse)

...happen to have them?

GITTES

Either you tell me or I guess 'cause

I don't have the answer.

ESCOBAR

You really think I'm stupid, don't

you, Gittes?

GITTES

I don't think about it one way or

the other. But if you want, give me

a day or two, and I'll get back to

you. Now I'd like to go home.

ESCOBAR

I want the rest of the pictures.

GITTES

What pictures?

ESCOBAR

(meaning the corpse)

This broad hired you, Gittes, not

Evelyn Mulwray.

GITTES

Yeah?

ESCOBAR

Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down

Mulwray, she hired you, and that's

how you happen to know Mulwray was

murdered.

GITTES

I heard it was an accident.

ESCOBAR

C'mon, you think you're dealing with

a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had

salt water in his goddam lungs! Now

how did he get that... in a fresh

water reservoir?

ESCOBAR

You were following him night and

day. You saw who killed him. You

even took pictures of it. It was

Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying

you off like a slot machine ever

since her husband died.

GITTES

(smiling)

You accusing me of extortion?

ESCOBAR

Absolutely.

GITTES

I don't think I need a day or two.

You're even dumber than you think I

think you are. Not only that, I'd

never extort a nickel out of my worst

enemy, that's where I draw the line,

Escobar.

ESCOBAR

Yeah, I once knew a whore who for

enough money would piss in a

customer's face, but she'd never

shit on his chest. That's where she

drew the line.

GITTES

(smiling)

Well, I hope she wasn't too much of

a disappointment to you, Lou.

ESCOBAR

I want those photographs, Gittes.

We're talking about accessory after

the fact, conspiracy, and extortion.

Minimum.

GITTES

Why do you think Mulwray's body was

moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray

knocked off her husband in the ocean

and thought it would look like more

of an accident if she hauled him up

to the Oak Pass Reservoir?

GITTES

(continuing)

Mulwray was murdered and moved because

somebody didn't want his body found

in the ocean.

ESCOBAR

And why's that?

GITTES

He found out somebody was dumping

water there. That's what they were

trying to cover up by moving him.

ESCOBAR

What are you talking about?

GITTES

C'mon I'll show you.

GITTES

(continuing)

C'mon make a decision, Lou. You're

in charge.

GITTES

(squinting in sunlight)

It's too late.

ESCOBAR

Too late for what?

GITTES

They only dump the water at night.

ESCOBAR

Reach anybody?

THIRD ASSISTANT

Yelburton, he's the new chief.

ESCOBAR

I know who he is. Well?

THIRD ASSISTANT

He says -

GITTES

I know what he says.

ESCOBAR

(to Gittes)

Shut up.

(to Assistant)

Go on.

THIRD ASSISTANT

Yelburton says they're irrigating in

the valley. There's always a little

runoff when they do that. And he

says is Gittes knows that, and has

been going around making irresponsible

accusations for the last week.

ONE OF ASSISTANTS

Let's swear out a warrant for her

arrest. What are we waiting for?

GITTES

(meaning Escobar)

Because he just made lieutenant, and

he wants to hang onto his little

gold bar.

ESCOBAR

Have your client in my office in two

hours and remember. I don't have to

let you go. I've got you for

withholding evidence right now.

GITTES

Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

MAID

No esta.

GITTES

(indicating luggage)

Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?...

(no answer)

on a trip?... vacation?...

MAID

No esta in casa.

GITTES

Bad for glass.

GARDENER

Oh yes, bad for glass.

GARDENER

(continuing)

Salt water velly bad for glass.

GITTES

Can't quite believe what he's heard,

GITTES

Salt water?

GARDENER

Velly velly bad.

GITTES

What's that... down there?

GITTES

(continuing)

...there.

CROSS' VOICE

Hello.

GITTES

Have you got your checkbook handy,

Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

CROSS' VOICE

You've got her? Where?

GITTES

Do you remember the figures we

discussed?

CROSS' VOICE

Of course I do. Where are you?

GITTES

At your daughter's house. How soon

can you get here?

CROSS' VOICE

Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be

there as well?

GITTES

Either that or she'll be in jail.

CROSS' VOICE

What are you talking about?

GITTES

Just bring your checkbook.

CHINESE SERVANT

You wait.

GITTES

(short sentence in

Chinese)

You wait.

EVELYN

How are you? I was calling you.

GITTES

Yeah?

EVELYN

Did you get some sleep?

GITTES

Sure.

EVELYN

Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you

something.

GITTES

(abruptly)

Where's the girl?

EVELYN

Upstairs. Why?

GITTES

I want to see her.

EVELYN

...she's having a bath now... why do

you want to see her?

GITTES

Going somewhere?

EVELYN

Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch.

Why?

GITTES

J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar

EVELYN

What are you doing? What's wrong? I

told you we've got a 4:30.

GITTES

(cutting her off)

You're going to miss your train!

(then, into phone)

Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's

above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah,

soon as you can.

EVELYN

What did you do that for?

GITTES

(a moment, then)

You know any good criminal lawyers?

EVELYN

(puzzled)

No...

GITTES

Don't worry. I can recommend a couple.

They're expensive but you can afford

it.

EVELYN

(evenly but with great

anger)

What the hell is this all about?

GITTES

I found these in your backyard... in

your fish pond. They belonged to

your husband, didn't they?... didn't

they?

EVELYN

I don't know. I mean yes, probably.

GITTES

Yes positively. That's where he was

drowned...

EVELYN

What are you saying?

GITTES

There's no time for you to be shocked

by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The

coroner's report proves he was killed

in salt water. Just take my word for

it. Now I want to know how it happened

and why. I want to know before Escobar

gets here because I want to hang

onto my license.

EVELYN

I don't know what you're talking

about. This is the most insane...

the craziest thing I ever...

GITTES

Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You

were jealous, you fought, he fell,

hit his head. It was an accident,

but his girl is a witness. You've

had to pay her off. You don't have

the stomach to harm her, but you've

got the money to shut her up. Yes or

no?

EVELYN

...no...

GITTES

Who is she? And don't give me that

crap about it being your sister. You

don't have a sister.

EVELYN

I'll tell you the truth...

GITTES

That's good. Now what's her name?

EVELYN

Katherine.

GITTES

Katherine?... Katherine who?

EVELYN

She's my daughter.

GITTES

I said the truth!

EVELYN

She's my sister.

EVELYN

She's my daughter.

EVELYN

My sister.

EVELYN

My daughter, my sister.

GITTES

I said I want the truth.

EVELYN

(almost screaming it)

She's my sister and my daughter!

EVELYN

(continuing; in Chinese)

For God's sake, Kyo, keep her

upstairs, go back!

EVELYN

My father and I, understand, or is

it too tough for you?

EVELYN

...he had a breakdown... the dam

broke... my mother died... he became

a little boy... I was fifteen...

he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast,

what clothes to wear!... It

happened... then I ran away...

GITTES

To Mexico...

EVELYN

Hollis came and took... care of me...

after she was born... he said... he

took care of her... I couldn't see

her... I wanted to but I couldn't...

I just want to see her once in a

while... take care of her... that's

all...  but I don't want her to

know... I don't want her to know...

GITTES

...so that's why you hate him...

EVELYN

No... for turning his back on me

after it happened! He couldn't face

it...

(weeping)

I hate him.

GITTES

Yeah... where are you taking her

now?

EVELYN

Back to Mexico.

GITTES

You can't go by train. Escobar'll be

looking for you everywhere.

EVELYN

How about a plane?

GITTES

That's worse... Just get out of here.

Walk out, leave everything.

EVELYN

I have to go home and get my things.

GITTES

I'll take care of it.

EVELYN

Where can we go?

GITTES

...where does Kyo live?

EVELYN

With us.

GITTES

On his day off. Get the exact address.

EVELYN

Okay...

EVELYN

Those didn't belong to Hollis.

GITTES

How do you know?

EVELYN

He didn't wear bifocals.

EVELYN

Say hello to Mr. Gittes, sweetheart.

KATHERINE

(from the stairs)

Hello.

GITTES

Rises a little shakily from the arm

of the sofa.

GITTES

Hello.

EVELYN

(calling down)

He lives at 1712 Alameda... do you

know where that is?

GITTES

Sure. It's Chinatown.

GITTES

Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah,

listen, pal, Escobar's going to try

and book me in about five minutes...

relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the

office for two hours. If you don't

hear from me, you and Duffy meet me

at 1712 Alameda.

WALSH'S VOICE

Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't

it?

GITTES

I know where it is! Just do it.

GITTES

(not even bothering

to look around the

sides)

Come on in, Lou. We're both too late.

GITTES

Looks like she flew the coop.

ESCOBAR

I don't suppose you got any idea

Where she went?

GITTES

Matter of fact I do.

ESCOBAR

Where?

GITTES

Her maid's house. I think she knows

something's up.

ESCOBAR

What's the maid's address?

GITTES

She lives in Pedro. I'll write it

down for you.

ESCOBAR

No, Gittes, you'll show us.

GITTES

What for?

ESCOBAR

If she's not there, you're going

downtown, and you're staying there

til she shows up.

GITTES

(deliberately petulant)

Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

ESCOBAR

(shoving him toward

the door)

Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.

ESCOBAR

That's it?

GITTES

Yeah.

ESCOBAR

Well, let's go.

GITTES

Do me a favor, will you, Lou?

GITTES

(continuing)

Let me bring her down myself... she's

not armed or nothing... she won't be

any problem... I'd just like a minute

alone with her... It would mean

something... to...  her... and to

me.

ESCOBAR

You never learn, do you, Gittes?

GITTES

(a little chagrined)

I guess not.

ESCOBAR

Give you three minutes.

GITTES

Gee, thanks, Lou.

WOMAN

Yes?...

CURLY

(happily)

Mr. Gittes! Come in, come in.

CURLY

Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.

GITTES

Call me Jake. How is everything?

CURLY

Just sitting down to supper, Jake.

Care to join us?

GITTES

No thanks.

CURLY

How about a glass of wine? Honey,

this is...

WIFE

(coolly)

Yes, I know.

GITTES

Thanks just the same, Curly. I could

use a glass of water, though. Come

out with me to the kitchen for a

second.

CURLY

(puzzled)

Sure thing.

GITTES

Curly, where's your car?

CURLY

In the garage.

GITTES

Where's that?

CURLY

Off the alley.

GITTES

Could you drive me somewhere?

CURLY

Sure, as soon as we eat.

GITTES

Right now, Curly. It can't wait.

CURLY

I'll just tell my wife.

GITTES

(pulling him out the

back door)

Tell her later.

GITTES' VOICE

Just drive slow for a block or two,

will you, Curly?

CURLY'S VOICE

What's this all about?

GITTES' VOICE

Tell you in a couple of blocks.

GITTES

How much do you owe me, Curly?

CURLY

(embarrassed)

Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out

tomorrow. I know you been real good

about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.

GITTES

Forget it. How would you like to pay

me off by taking a couple of

passengers to Ensenada... you'd have

to leave tonight.

CURLY

I don't know...

GITTES

I might be able to squeeze an extra

seventy-five bucks out of it for

you. Maybe an even hundred.

CURLY

Plus what I owe you?

GITTES

I'll throw that in too.

CURLY

(smiling)

Okay, you got yourself a boat.

GITTES

Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half

an hour after you get there. Then if

I don't show, take her down to the

boat.

CURLY

(a little worried)

You sure this is okay?

GITTES

(mildly indignant)

Curly, you know how long I been in

business.

CROSS

There you are.

CROSS

(continuing)

Well, you don't look any the worse

for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say...

where's the girl?...

GITTES

I've got her.

CROSS

Is she all right?

GITTES

She's fine.

CROSS

Where is she?

GITTES

With her mother.

CROSS

...with her mother?

GITTES

I'd like you to look at something,

Mr. Cross.

CROSS

(taking it)

What is it?

GITTES

An obituary column... can you read

in this light?

CROSS

Yes... I think I can manage...

CROSS

What does this mean?

GITTES

That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

GITTES

Right here, in this pond. You drowned

him...  and you left these.

GITTES

...the coroner's report showed Mulwray

had salt water in his lungs.

CROSS

(finally)

Hollie was always fond of tide-pools.

You know what he used to say about

them?

GITTES

Haven't the faintest idea.

CROSS

That's where life begins... marshes,

sloughs, tide-pools... he was

fascinated by them...  you know when

we first came out here he figured

that if you dumped water onto desert

sand it would percolate down into

the bedrock and stay there, instead

of evaporating the way it does in

most reservoirs. You'd lose only

twenty percent instead of seventy or

eighty. He made this city.

GITTES

And that's what you were going to do

in the Valley?

CROSS

(after a long moment)

No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am

doing with the Valley. The bond issue

passes Tuesday. There'll be ten

million to build an aqueduct and

reservoir. I'm doing it.

GITTES

There's going to be some irate

citizens when they find out they're

paying for water they're not getting.

CROSS

That's all taken care of. You see,

Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the

water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to

the water.

GITTES

How do you do that?

CROSS

Just incorporate the Valley into the

city so the water goes to L.A. after

all. It's very simple.

GITTES

(then)

How much are you worth?

CROSS

(shrugs, then)

I have no idea. How much do you want?

GITTES

I want to know what you're worth.

Over ten million?

CROSS

Oh, my, yes.

GITTES

Then why are you doing it? How much

better can you eat? What can you buy

that you can't already afford?

CROSS

(a long moment, then:)

The future, Mr. Gittes. The future.

Now where's the girl?... I want the

only daughter I have left... as you

found out, Evelyn was lost to me a

long time ago.

GITTES

(with sarcasm)

Who do you blame for that? Her?

CROSS

I don't blame myself. You see, Mr.

Gittes, most people never have to

face the fact that at the right time

and right place, they're capable of

anything. Take those glasses from

him, will you, Claude?

CROSS

It's not worth it, Mr. Gittes. It's

really not worth it.

CROSS

Take us to the girl. Either Evelyn

allows me to see her, or I'm not

averse to seeing Evelyn in jail. If

I have to buy the jail. Hollis and

Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen

years. It's been too long, I'm too

old.

CROSS

(suddenly)

Stop the car. Stop the car!

CROSS

Katherine! Katherine! Wait!

GITTES

No, Curly, get 'em out of here! Get

'em out of here!

EVELYN

No, don't help him. Don't do anything.

EVELYN

She's gone. It's no good.

CROSS

Where?

GITTES

(moving to Evelyn)

Let me handle that.

EVELYN

(to Gittes)

I'm all right.

GITTES

(she's not)

Sure, but I'd like to handle it.

CROSS

You're going to have to kill me,

Evelyn. Either that or tell me where

she is.

CROSS

How many years have I got?... she's

mine too.

EVELYN

She's never going to know that.

GITTES

Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.

(to Walsh)

Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to

bring the police department with

you.

WALSH

Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all

over the place. You oughta know

better.

GITTES

(to Walsh, meaning

Cross)

Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart,

will you?

(moving to Evelyn)

Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in

Pedro, near the Starkist cannery.

It's the Evening Star. He'll be

waiting. I'll take care of this.

ESCOBAR

Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run

around like that.

GITTES

Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know

what's going on. Let her go. I'll

explain it later.

ESCOBAR

Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious

offense pointing that at an officer

of the law. It's a felony.

GITTES

Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.

ESCOBAR

(starting toward her)

I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.

GITTES

Lou, she will kill you. Let her go

for now. You don't know.

ESCOBAR

Gittes, stay outta this.

GITTES

(to Evelyn)

Now take off.

ESCOBAR

I'll just have her followed. She's

not going anywhere.

GITTES

(yelling)

No!

GITTES

Where is he? I'll kill him, I'll

kill the son of a bitch.

GITTES

(to Escobar)

Who is he, get his name? I'll kill

him.

ESCOBAR

(badly shaken)

Take it easy, take it easy, it was

an accident.

GITTES

An accident?

GITTES

Get him away from her. He's

responsible for everything. Get him

away from her!

ESCOBAR

(stunned)

Jake, you're very disturbed. You're

crazy. That's her father.

ESCOBAR

(to them)

You wanna do your partner the biggest

favor of his life? Take him home.

Just get him the hell out of here!

THE END
