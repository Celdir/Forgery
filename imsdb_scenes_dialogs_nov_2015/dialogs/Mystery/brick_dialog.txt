SUPER MAIN TITLES

Over a grimy concrete wall creeping by. We emerge from...

EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING

A gaping hole in the concrete side of a freeway. On the

embankment beside the hole BRENDAN FRYE squats, shoulders

hunched. His dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the

shallow stream of water which flows into the tunnel.

THE WATER

not more than six inches deep. Just beneath the surface a

young woman's pale blue arm in gaudy bracelets bats against

the edge of her body like a docked boat. A pebble plinks

into the water beside it.1

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:         "2 DAYS PREVIOUS"

INT. LOCKER CAGE - DAY

A single locker. That same arm, bracelets and all, slips a

note through the slats, then leaves quickly.

As the cage empties a lone figure slumps to the locker.

Opens it. The note falls to his feet.

The figure is Brendan. He unfolds the note (folded in a

triangle) -- "12:30 PICO & ALEXANDER".

A STREET SIGN

Pico and Alexander.2

A WRIST WATCH

12:43.   Brendan looks up from the watch.

EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

He sits on the curb of a wide suburban street, eats lunch

from a brown bag and watches a phone booth on the corner. He

shows no surprise when it begins to ring. Brendan goes to

the phone and puts the receiver to his ear. Silence for a

moment, then a thin female voice from the phone.

Originally Dode was later revealed to have been hiding above the tunnel.

The street names were changed in production to match existing streets (we couldn't

VOICE

(over phone)

Brendan?

BRENDAN

Emily?

EMILY

(weakly)

Yeah. How's things?

BRENDAN

(slow, deliberate)

Status quo.

EMILY

Yeah?

BRENDAN

Uh huh.

EMILY

That's good.

BRENDAN

What's going on, Em?

EMILY

(through strained crying)

It's good to see you, Brendan.

EMILY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

It's been some time.

BRENDAN

Two months.

EMILY

Yeah. I didn't even know your locker. I

had to ask Brain.

BRENDAN

Em, why don't we meet somewhere?

EMILY

I can't.

3

BRENDAN

Why not?

EMILY

I screwed up real bad. I really screwed

up.

BRENDAN

Screwed up how?

EMILY

(blubbering, fast and

incoherent)

I did what she said with the brick, I

didn't know it was bad, but the pin's on

it now for poor Frisco and they're

playing it all on me-

BRENDAN

Slow down now, what?

EMILY

You gotta help me Brendan I think tug-

Oh!

With a sharp breath the line clicks dead just as a black

mustang roars by. Brendan drops the receiver and spins out

of the booth.

There, another pay phone up the hill -- empty.

Brendan turns to the black mustang, far down the street. A

man's hand drops a cigarette butt from the driver side

window.1

The mustang turns the corner, gone.

Brendan walks after it, finds the cigarette butt on the

street. Still smoking.

A pale blue arrow is printed on the filter.

In the distance the class bell rings.

EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

The high school is open air - the hallways are alleyways

between buildings. A short kid with eyeglasses the size of

Because of the orientation of the street, this was all flipped when we shot it, and the

BRENDAN

Brain.

THE BRAIN

Hey Brendan. It's been awhile. Where you

been eating?

BRENDAN

Back of school.

THE BRAIN

Huh. Yeah, no one's seen you. What's it

been, a couple months?

BRENDAN

Yeah, it's been awhile. You gave Emily

my locker number?

THE BRAIN

A few days ago. Was I wrong?

BRENDAN

What?

THE BRAIN

To give it?

BRENDAN

No.

THE BRAIN

It's been so long, I don't know you

two's stats.

BRENDAN

It has been awhile.   Who's she been

eating with?

THE BRAIN

(uncomfortable)

I dunno. It's hard to keep track.

BRENDAN

Is it?

THE BRAIN

(shrugs)

Can be.

5

BRENDAN

Uh huh.

THE BRAIN

She hasn't been doing too good.

BRENDAN

Yeah well. I'm not looking for a patch

up. Em's life is her own. But she

asked for my help.

THE BRAIN

Help with what?

BRENDAN

I don't know. I don't even care, it's

not my business. I just want to know

she's ok, so I've got to find her.

That's all this is.

THE BRAIN

Well. I know she was poking in with the

Ivy-bound cheerleading elite. Laura

Dannon's crowd.

BRENDAN

Laura Dannon there with the Rabbit?

THE BRAIN

Yeah. Brad Bramish with her. Cream on

the upper crust.

BRENDAN

(softly)

He's a sap.

THE BRAIN

Know him?

BRENDAN

By sight.

THE BRAIN

I won't argue then. Anyway Em tagged

after them for a bit, but it didn't

work. So she picked her way down the

food chain. Last I seen she was with

whasshername, that drama vamp. Small

time dealer, augh, the evil one, the one

you dated-

BRENDAN

Kara.

THE BRAIN

That's my bus.

BRENDAN

You know her locker number?

THE BRAIN

Kara's?

BRENDAN

Em's.

THE BRAIN

239.

BRENDAN

Thanks Brain. Keep your specs on, find

me if she shows.

THE BRAIN

Sure.

GIRL

(through a mocking smile)

Hello, Brendan.

BRENDAN

Kara.

KARA

Come to see the show?

BRENDAN

No, I didn't.

(nudges the freshman with his

toe)

Lapdog, blow.

KARA

(to the lapdog)

Stay.

(to Brendan)

Don't be mean.

BRENDAN

I'm all friendly.

(to the lapdog)

Watch your head, kid - that thing bites.

BRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)

I need words.

KARA

I'm listening.

BRENDAN

About Emily Kostich.

She stops nuzzling a little too quickly.

KARA

(to the dog)

Get me my purse.

(he goes)

Hurry!

He breaks into a trot. Kara smiles at Brendan.

BRENDAN

Still picking your teeth with freshmen?

KARA

You were a freshman once.

She slides her fingers up his arm. He growls and pushes them

away.

BRENDAN

Way once, sister. You and Em were tight

for a bit. Who's she eating with now?

KARA

Eating with?

BRENDAN

Eating with. Lunch.           Who.

KARA

You're a cutie.

BRENDAN

You gonna tell me?

KARA

Guess you're up from the underneath

then. The whole Jerr thing blown over.

Lucky strikes, you and your partner get

bulled, you come up clean. But I guess

you were always the brains of the

outfit.1

One of many instances of an allusion to the Jerr backstory, most of which were

BRENDAN

Where's Emily?

KARA

Sometimes I wonder why I dumped you.

BRENDAN

(standing to go)

God.

KARA

I don't know where she's at, Brendan.

BRENDAN

I know you do, so why don't you want me

to find her?

KARA

Maybe I'm looking out for you.

BRENDAN

(going)

Well I appreciate that.

KARA

Brendan... you looking to get back into

things? I could use you.

WOMAN'S VOICE

(over phone)

Hello?

BRENDAN

Hello, ma'am, this is Tom, I'm a friend

from school. Could I speak to...

WOMAN'S VOICE

(over phone)

Oh, hi Tom. Laura's here, hold on.

LAURA'S VOICE

(over phone)

Yes?

BRENDAN

I'm calling for details.

LAURA'S VOICE

For what?

BRENDAN

Details about the party.

LAURA'S VOICE

Who is this?

BRENDAN

I don't think we've met.

LAURA'S VOICE

Well then I don't think you're invited

to my party. It's a rather exclusive

gathering.

BRENDAN

I can imagine.

(she starts to speak, he cuts

her off)

You should really work on your invite

management. That might be a personal

'room for improvement' area in your

life. But discretion of your invite

sending aside, I have procured a certain

someone's invitation, and would like

details.

11

LAURA'S VOICE

You think you're cute, whoever you are.

BRENDAN

Wait'll you get a load of my felt fedora

and spats.

LAURA'S VOICE

Who are you? Or I'll hang up.

BRENDAN

You don't know me - I'll save you some

time.

LAURA'S VOICE

I know everyone and I've got all the

time in the world.

BRENDAN

Folly of youth. Ask whose invitation

I've got.

LAURA'S VOICE

(slightly)

What you said.

BRENDAN

Emily Kostich.

LAURA'S VOICE

15 Bush street, up in Stockton Cove.

Buzz 42 at the gate. Nine o'clock. But

who-

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

12

EXT. STOCKTON COVE GATE - NIGHT

An imposing private community gate. Brendan coasts up on his

bike and ditches it in the bushes. He checks the call box

directory: "42 -- DANNON"

Using the call box as a hand hold he hops the gate and walks

briskly up the street.

EXT. STOCKTON COVE STREET - NIGHT

Shiny cars line the curb. Party noises come from an upscale

two story house. Brendan takes a short breath, then strides

up to the front door.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Large and clean, with a two story ceiling and a railed

staircase at one end. Fifteen or twenty clean people, some

in costumes, mill about in cliques. Brendan comes in as if

he doesn't mind who sees him coming in. He gets a couple odd

stares, but no one stops him.

With non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd to

the beer keg in back and draws half a cup.

INT. PARLOUR - SAME

Richly adorned, crowded, lit with bright pools of light.

Brendan drifts in and stands in the back, deep in shadow.

The music comes from a baby grand piano set against one

wall. Laura Dannon leans against it. She wears a red

kimono, and is striking against the velvet black piano.

Laura's kid sister, 11 years old with glasses, sits at the

piano playing "All I do is Dream of You".

Laura sings, lovely and soft but with strength.1

Brendan watches from the back, his face obscured in shadow,

but his eyes gleam. Through the darkened window behind him

a match flares up, and someone standing outside lights a

cigarette.

Laura finishes the song. The room applauds, and she ruffles

her kid sister's hair.

Brendan ducks out, and into

By the time we got around to production this had changed to "Someone to Watch Over

BRAD

If the coach wants to play me I'll play,

but I can't put my best game in if I've

got to worry about whether I'm going to

be in there. Halftime last game, coach

is pissed I ran it on a pass play, out

on the field he says to me 'you gotta

think about the team and you gotta' you

know and 'if you run that ball again

you're out', and I said to him you gotta

let me play! I'm out there, let me play,

and he's saying 'no you're out' and I

kept saying 'Let me play! Let me play!

Let me play!', just right in his face-

BIFF

He was!

BRAD

Just 'Let me play! Let me play! Let me

play!' 'No you gotta' 'No, let me play!

Let me play! Let me play!'

BRENDAN

Tom!

BRENDAN (cont'd)

Could you step aside, please? I'm

trying to follow Brad's story, and it's

difficult when I can't see his face.

14

BRAD

(stumbles)

He doesn't give me a play to make, what

can I do, you know?

BRAD (cont'd)

Hey. Hey! What are you doing here?

BRENDAN

Leaving.

BRAD

Oh yeah?

BRENDAN

Uh huh. Unless your anecdote's got a 2nd

act.

BRAD

Why don't you leave?

BRENDAN

(leaving)

That's what I was doing.

LAURA

(O.S.)

Whiskey?

15

BRENDAN

Jameson.

LAURA

I like a man who knows what he's

drinking.

BRENDAN

That's a pretty sick thing to be

attracted to.

LAURA

Brad's not a good guy to get on the

wrong side of.

BRENDAN

Uh huh.

LAURA

Fearless flyer. Quit your yappin and fix

me one.

LAURA

I'll never get through all this.

BRENDAN

Uh huh.

LAURA

I knew your old partner Jerr since grade

school. Tough break. How long were you

two joined up before your operation got

the sting?

BRENDAN

LAURA

LAURA

BRENDAN

17

LAURA

Keep up with me now. I don't know, but

it sounded like you did, and a body's

got a right to be curious. Now I'm not

so sure.

BRENDAN

Well I'll put that body to bed. I don't

know a damn thing about whatever

troubles, and that works for me. I just

want to find her.

LAURA

Coffee and pie.

BRENDAN

Coffee and pie oh my?

LAURA

And you didn't hear it from me.

LAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Will you wait here for me?

BRENDAN

Sure.

LAURA

You'll stay right here and wait -- I'll

be five minutes.

BRENDAN

Yes.

19

BRENDAN

Where's Dode?

STONER 1

Dunno, bra.

BRENDAN

Dode?

STONER 2

Uh uh.

DODE

Hey Brendan. Maybe you shouldn't be

here.

20

BRENDAN

Kara told me you know where Em's at.

DODE

Uh huh.   And why are you looking for Em?

BRENDAN

She asked for my help.

DODE

Uh huh. Listen man, I've got plenty on

my plate without dealing with some

jilted ex.

BRENDAN

It's not about that.

DODE

Whatever it's about, act smarter than

you look and drop it.

BRENDAN

Where is she?

DODE

She's with me, and right now that's the

best place for her. Leave the low life

to the low lifers and dangle.

BRENDAN

You're on the bright side of dim, Dode,

but if I thought you had this half-

handled I'd be eating lunch. Where's

she at?

DODE

Better get while it's good.

DODE (cont'd)

Heel it now, dig?

21

BIG STONER

Back off.

BRENDAN

Throw one at me if you want, hash head.

I've got all five senses and I slept

last night, that puts me six up on the

lot of you.

BIG STONER

Just easy-

BRENDAN

(to Dode)

Where's Em?

DODE

(deliberate)

She's with me. She was tight when she

called you, man. Came to and freaked.

She told me to shake you if you came by.

Said you'd only make things worse.

STONER 1 (O.S.)

Put him down, man!

DODE

Deal with whatever this ain't about and

drop it.

BIG STONER

(to Brendan)

Nothing more here, bra.

BRENDAN

Tell Emily I want to see her. Tell her

if she still wants my help or not that's

her business, but I want to hear it

straight from her.

DODE

She don't -

BRENDAN

Today. She knows where I eat lunch.

22

BIG STONER

And stay out, punk!

FADE OUT:

LATER

23

EMILY

I must have sounded pretty crazy on the

phone. Yesterday.

EMILY (cont'd)

It was dumb, I got paranoid over a

really stupid thing. I was high, I went

crazy for a little bit, but now you have

to forget about it. Please. That's how

you can help me now, forget about it.

EMILY (cont'd)

Brendan, I know you're mad at all these

people, cause you think I went away from

you and went to them. But you've got to

start seeing it as my decision, stop

being angry because where I want to be

at's different from where you wanna be

at.

BRENDAN

(angry)

Who fed you that line, Em?

EMILY

And stop picking on Dode. He's a good

guy.

BRENDAN

The Carrows rat?

24

EMILY

He's a good friend.

BRENDAN

So what am I?

EMILY

(strained anger)

Yeah, what are you? Eating back here,

not liking anybody, how are you judging

anyone? I loved you alot but I couldn't

stand it, I had to get with people. I

couldn't heckle life with you, I had to

see what was what.

EMILY (cont'd)

I'm sorry Brendan.

BRENDAN

You've got to come back to me, Em.

EMILY

No. No. Never. I'm sorry. Never. I can't

love on your terms, Brendan. I can't do

that, I'm not like you.

BRENDAN

You're in a spot, I can get you out of

it. Come back to me, and whatever heat

follows you I'll deal with.

EMILY

No. You're not hearing me, no. I don't

want to be put away and protected. No.

EMILY (cont'd)

No.

BRENDAN

Tell me about the trouble, the brick and

the pin -

EMILY

You gonna fix things like you did with

Jerr? No. I came to say goodbye, for

good. Whatever you have to do to let me

go, do it. I'm gonna let you go, I've

25

decided that. Make sure that, you've got

to, promise you won't torture yourself,

that you'll let me go.

She embraces him, enveloping him in her jacket. His face is

a frozen mask.

EMILY (cont'd)

Let me go.

As she pulls away he mechanically slips an address book from

her jacket pocket.

He watches her as she walks away.

INT. CLASSROOM

Brendan sits in the back, flipping through the address book.

The teacher drones on about the significance of the pig's

head in "Lord of the Flies".1

THE ADDRESS BOOK

Illegible scribbles, names, numbers, nothing that stops his

search - then the note Dode gave her, a corner of loose-leaf

paper which looks like this:

Brendan studies the paper intently.

EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

The Brain studies the paper. Busses pull into the parking

lot behind them. Brendan is distant, lost in thought.

THE BRAIN

Hm. Do you know anything else about

this?

Our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to Brendan's lunch spot to save us

26

BRENDAN

(shakes his head)

Mm.

THE BRAIN

Slim pickings. Why'd you let Dode fly

when he came back to whose-her-name, at

the theater?

BRENDAN

(shrugs dismissively)

Kara. It's their turf, I couldn't hear

them without being seen, and that would

only biff their play. Best to know it's

there, let it ride and see what comes of

it.

(touches the paper)

But anyway.

THE BRAIN

Hm. Well, if this is what I think it is,

it didn't come straight from Dode, less

he's playing out of his league.

(beat)

I can only give you my best guess.

BRENDAN

Yeah.

THE BRAIN

When the upper crust does shady deeds

they do them in different spots around

town. I know under the pier's one, down

by the bike trails in the state park's

another. There's alot of them. The pitch

is they've got little symbols for each

one, and that's how they tell each other

the place, so word won't get around. So

this might be that.

BRENDAN

But Dode wouldn't know it?

THE BRAIN

This is upper crust. Dode's pie pan

grease.

BRENDAN

Call anything up?

27

THE BRAIN

How many places start with 'A'? Or if

it's a shape, or just a random symbol.

Anyway, even if you figured it out, what

good could you do? She's smart, she

knows the play, she's gunning to square

things.

BRENDAN

Yeah.

THE BRAIN

You said her business was none of yours,

so she's alright, forget it now. Go

home, sleep.

LATER

28

29

FIGURE

(low whisper)

Your little Em.

VOICE ON PHONE

Saint Clement police.

VOICE ON PHONE (cont'd)

Saint Clement police, hello? Hello?

30

THE BRAIN

Hey, Brendan.

THE BRAIN (cont'd)

You're up early.

BRENDAN

(thick, distant)

I couldn't sleep.

THE BRAIN

(nods, back to his book)

Find Emily?

THE BRAIN (cont'd)

You alright?

BRENDAN

Yeah. What, are you here for zero?

THE BRAIN

Nah, I gotta take the early bus, cause

the others don't run by my street.

BRENDAN

Bad break.

THE BRAIN

Eh. Time to read's nice. So what's the

word with Em?

BRENDAN

She's gone.

THE BRAIN

Can't raise her?

BRENDAN

No, I can't.

THE BRAIN

So what now?

31

BRENDAN

Now. I don't know. I guess it's... I

don't know.

BRENDAN (cont'd)

Brain, I can't let her go. I was set to

but I can't. I don't think I can.

THE BRAIN

You think you can help her?

BRENDAN

No.

THE BRAIN

You think you can get the straight,

maybe break some deserving teeth?

BRENDAN

Yeah. I think I could.

THE BRAIN

Well.

BRENDAN

Kara tried to rope me. She came right

out and asked. She was scared. Tell me

to walk from this, Brain. Tell me to

drop it.

THE BRAIN

Walk from it. Drop it.

(grins)

You're thick as what-all, Brendan.

BRENDAN

Yes I am.

BRENDAN (cont'd)

I'd need you to Op. Like on Jerr, but

that was cake to this. And unlike Jerr,

there's not much chance we'll come out

clean. Twenty four seven on this one.

You okay to op for me again?

32

The Brain barely smiles.

THE BRAIN

What first, tip the bulls?

Brendan puts on his glasses, stands to go.

BRENDAN

No, bulls would gum it. They'd flash

their dusty standards at the wide-eyes

and probably find some yegg to pin,

probably even the right one. But they'd

trample the real tracks and scare the

real players back into their holes, and

if we're doing this I want the whole

story. No cops, not for a bit.

THE BRAIN

So what first?

BRENDAN

I don't know. Your mom still have the

cell?

THE BRAIN

In her car.

BRENDAN

Borrow it for a few days, get me the

number.

(stands to go)

Wait for my word, and cover for me first

period. I'm going to be a little late.

EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY

A vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball

courts outlined in cracked paint.1 Brendan trudges across

it, his steps heavy. He stops and stands very still, staring

at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to

THE HORIZON

Flat, gray, pin straight. Brendan's voice starts speaking

rapidly, confident and clear.

This describes the location at my school that the "showdown" scenes were originally

33

BRENDAN (O.S.)

Yeah it was personal. Jerr spooked some

decent gees and ran around some what was

straight with him, but I'm nobody's bull

runner. This wasn't a business sit. But

yeah. I bulled him. Got in tight,

partnered up and sent him over.

PAN AROUND to reveal BRENDAN. He looks different, edgier,

more alive, wearing different clothes and a thin goatee1. He

keeps talking directly at us.

BRENDAN (cont'd)

I'd bull the lot of them, Em, I'd burn

down the whole party if they tried to

play you again. Jerr and whoever's next.

I want to keep you safe.

An ARM swings into frame, wearing cheap plastic bracelets

and pale blue fingernail polish. It slaps Brendan hard in

the face. He catches it. Emily wrenches her arm away and

stumbles backwards onto the pavement.

Brendan grabs her sleeve. She twists away. He grabs her

shoulder, grabs her waist, she resists, and suddenly they

are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a

shout she breaks away and falls to the ground.

A beat.     Gulls cry in the distance.

EMILY

You can't keep me safe, Brendan. I'm in

a bigger world now, and you can't hide

me from it, and you can't beat it. Not

if I don't want you to.

Brendan's face looks lumpish, while Emily's is strong. She

stands and walks off into the distance across the barren

field.

BRENDAN'S FACE

Watching her go. It is back to present day, pale, clean

shaven, sullen. His eyes are cold with resolve.

EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING

Brendan sloshes down into the water. Without delicacy he

lifts Emily's body and pulls her back into the tunnel.

INT. RUNOFF TUNNEL

Which Joe would not even consider, thank god.

34

Pitch back. Brendan lays the body down. Two beady eyes peer

at him from the darkness - he freezes. The eyes hop forward

- a gull. The two watch each other for a moment, then the

gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the

tunnel. Brendan follows it without looking back at the

body.1

EXT. CROWDED HALLWAY - DAY

Brendan and the Brain lean against a wall. The Brain slips

him a piece of paper.

THE BRAIN

There's the cell number.

BRENDAN

Keep it on vibrate.

THE BRAIN

(pats his jacket pocket)

Yeah.

BRENDAN

Better stop meeting me in the open too.

I'm going to start getting visible, and

I need you on the underneath. I'll call.

THE BRAIN

Trueman asked for you. Wants words in

his office.

BRENDAN

I bet. Keep him off me - stonewall him,

he won't bite, just keep him away from

me.

THE BRAIN

I'll try. So what's first?

BRENDAN

Make Em's troubles mine. I'm going to

throw a few words at you, tell me if

they catch. Brick.

THE BRAIN

No.

A very early draft held on the tunnel after Brendan left, and revealed a dark figure

35

BRENDAN

Or bad brick.

THE BRAIN

No.

BRENDAN

Tug.

THE BRAIN

Tug... that might be a drink.

BRENDAN

Drink?

THE BRAIN

Vodka and milk or something, or maybe

not.

BRENDAN

Poor Frisco.

THE BRAIN

Frisco. Frisco Farr1 was a sophomore

last year, I think. Real trash, maybe

hit a class a week. Didn't know him

then, and haven't seen him around.

BRENDAN

Pin.

THE BRAIN

Pin... the Pin?

BRENDAN

The Pin, yeah.

THE BRAIN

The Pin's kind of a local spook story.

You know the Kingpin?

BRENDAN

I've heard it.

THE BRAIN

Same thing. Supposed to be old, like 26,

lives in town.

All apologies to Frisco Farr, who the author did actually go to school with, and who

36

BRENDAN

Jake1 runner, right?

THE BRAIN

Big time... maybe. Ask any dope rat

where their junk sprang they'll say they

scraped it from that who scored it from

this who bought it off so, and after

four or five connections the list'll

always end with the Pin. But I'll becha

you got every rat in town together and

said 'show your hands' if any of them've

actually seen the Pin, you'd get a crowd

of full pockets.

BRENDAN

You think the Pin's just a tale to take

whatever heat?

THE BRAIN

(shrugs. Beat)

But what's first?

BRENDAN

A show of hands.

INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER

Brendan strides past forest scenery and drama geeks, through

another door and into sunlight.

EXT. BACK OF THEATER - DAY

Kara smokes a cigarette. Brendan leans beside her.

KARA

(annoyed)

Hey Brendan. Here for the show?

BRENDAN

No.

KARA

Would you go then, honey, cause I've got

this headache.

BRENDAN

Try smoking like a chimney, I've heard

that helps.

In an admittedly paltry concession to clarity, this was changed to `Dope runner' in post

37

BRENDAN (cont'd)

Isn't this Dode's brand?

KARA

You don't know Dode's brand.

BRENDAN

Oh I do now.

BRENDAN (cont'd)

I'm going to start shaking things up.

Give me the story and you might miss the

bite.

KARA

The story about what?

BRENDAN

Alright.

KARA

The story about what?

BRENDAN

I don't want to play games if you've got

a headache. Get me if you want to spill

it, but I can't guarantee safe passage

after tonight.

KARA

I don't know what-

BRENDAN

Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling

card, and I need words.

KARA

Brad Bramish?

38

BRENDAN

(fast and low)

Tail Kara through lunch. She's got

rehearsal but she'll blow early. She

goes home, drop her, else wait for my

call.

BRAD

That's all I'm saying, is put me in the

game and I'll do what needs to be done,

but they don't put me in, what needs

doing don't get done and don't come

crying to me, man. Get off my grill man,

you didn't put me in, don't come to me

if you didn't let me play.

BIFF

They didn't!

BRAD

Hey! What are you doing here?

39

BRENDAN

Listening.

BRAD

Uh huh.

BRENDAN

Alright, you got me. I'm a scout for the

Gophers.

BRAD

(not amused)

Oh yeah?

BRENDAN

Of all things, yeah. Been watching your

game for a month, but that story just

now clenched it. You've got heart, kid.

How soon can you move to Minneapolis?

BRAD

(flat with anger)

Yeah?

BRENDAN

Cold winters, but they've got a great

public transit system.

BRAD

Yeah?

BRENDAN

Yeah.

BRAD

Oh yeah?

BRENDAN

There's a thesaurus in the library.

'Yeah's under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait.

BRAD

Who invited you?

BRENDAN

To the parking lot? Well gee I kind of

invited myself.

BRAD

I think you'd better leave then.

40

BRENDAN

No, I'm having too good a time.

BRAD

Just the same.

BRAD (cont'd)

Maybe you want to go someplace more

private.

BRENDAN

With you?

BRENDAN (cont'd)

(as if he's been asked to the

movies)

Sure.

BRAD

You know what's good for you you'll just

beat it. Beating a small frye won't win

me anything and it's not going to do you

any good-

41

STRAGGLER

Hey, is there a fight?

BRENDAN

Yeah.

LAURA

Hey.

LAURA

You're quite a pill.

BRENDAN

Uh huh.

42

LAURA

Where are you going?

BRENDAN

Home.

LAURA

Why did you take a powder the other

night?

BRENDAN

Same reason I'm taking one now.

LAURA

Hold it.

(he keeps walking)

I don't get you. That's a chilly heel to

be giving a girl who's where you want to

know about.

BRENDAN

I'll get where I'm going just fine.

LAURA

I want to help you.

BRENDAN

Go away.

BRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Look, I can't trust you. You ought to be

smart enough to know that. I didn't

shake the party up to get your

attention, and I'm not heeling you to

hook you. Your connections could help

me, but the bad baggage they bring could

make it zero sum game or even hurt me,

so I'm better off coming at it clean.

LAURA

I wouldn't have to lead you in by the

hand-

BRENDAN

I can't trust you. Brad was a sap, you

weren't, you were with him and so you

were playing him, so you're a player.

With you behind me I'd have to tie one

eye up watching both your hands, and I

can't spare it.

43

LAURA

You're not Brad.

BRENDAN

No, I'm not.

THE BRAIN

(on the phone)

You didn't call.

BRENDAN

Sorry. Kara went home though, didn't

she?

THE BRAIN

Yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and

made two calls that she didn't want on

her phone bill.

BRENDAN

Get the numbers?

THE BRAIN

No. Sorry.

BRENDAN

S'alright. Are me and Brad front page

news?

THE BRAIN

All the buzz. You really do that?

BRENDAN

Yeah.

THE BRAIN

Why? Is Brad the Pin?

BRENDAN

Brad's a sap. I downed him on his field

and his crew didn't bite. So now I know

he's a sap and anyone who acts like he

isn't is profiting by it. That's not why

I roughed him, though.

44

BRAIN

For kicks?

BRENDAN

Economics. Brad's the school's biggest

jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all

the selling, I just got his attention.

Anyway, now's just shaking things out.

Look, you know a kid around the burgh,

lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black

tang?

THE BRAIN

I told you before I don't know the car.

Those types are a nickel a pound, but

nobody I know that you don't. And

Trueman again-

BRENDAN

Keep him off. And keep your specs on - I

need to find that kid.

THE BRAIN

Okay.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

45

TRUEMAN

You didn't know this boy?

BRENDAN

No sir, never seen him.

TRUEMAN

And he just hit you?

BRENDAN

Like I said, he asked for my lunch money

first. Good thing I brown bagged it.

TRUEMAN

Alright Brendan. I've been looking to

talk to you.

TRUEMAN (cont'd)

You've helped this office out before.

BRENDAN

No. I gave you Jerr to see him eaten,

not to see you fed.

TRUEMAN

Fine, and well put.

BRENDAN

Accelerated English, Mrs. Kasprzyk.

TRUEMAN

Tough teacher?

BRENDAN

Tough but fair.

TRUEMAN

Mm. Anyway then, we know you're clean,

and you've, despite your motives, you've

been an asset to us. I think you're a

good kid.

BRENDAN

Uh huh.

46

TRUEMAN

I want to run a couple names by you.

TRUEMAN (cont'd)

We're not done here.

BRENDAN

(angry)

I was done here three months ago. I told

you then I'd give you Jerr and that was

that, I'm not your inside line and I'm

not your boy.

TRUEMAN

That's not a very helpful-

BRENDAN

(anger builds)

You know what I'm in if the wrong yeg

saw me pulled in here?

TRUEMAN

What are you in?

BRENDAN

No. And no more of these informal chats

- if you've got a discipline issue with

me write me up or suspend me and I'll

see you at the parent conference.

TRUEMAN

Hold it, I could - hold it - could write

you up for talking back to a VP. For

looking at me in a threatening way. I'd

exercise a little more tact, Mr. Frye.

You can't pull a play like that unless I

need you for something. So do I?

BRENDAN

Maybe.

TRUEMAN

So maybe you're gonna need me too.

BRENDAN

Maybe. Alright, I need you off my back

completely for a few weeks. There might

be some heat soon.

47

TRUEMAN

(interested)

If it's something I can't cover, I won't

go to bat for you.

BRENDAN

If I get caught like that it's curtains

anyway - I couldn't have brass cutting

me favors in public. I'm just saying now

so you don't come kicking in my homeroom

door once trouble starts.

TRUEMAN

Okay, here's what I can do. I won't pin

you for anything you aren't caught at.

I'll ride it a little while, as long as

it doesn't get too rough. But if

anything comes up with your fingerprints

on it, I can't help you. Also, if I get

to the end of whatever this is and it

gets hot and you don't deliver, The Veep

will need someone to hand over, police-

wise. And I'll have you. There better be

some meat at the end of this like you

say, or at least a fall guy, or you're

it.

BRENDAN

Sure I am. Got one more favor to ask.

TRUEMAN

Get the hell off my campus, punk!

THE BRAIN

No, Dode's MIA all around.

48

BRENDAN

I'm 9 of 10 that Kara's got him, but who

knows where. I shook but she's not

spilling.

THE BRAIN

No more job offers? So she's got a play.

BRENDAN

And I know enough about Kara to let that

worry me. Alright, keep your specs on

for him. Any other news?

THE BRAIN

Some. Laura Dannon came to me looking

for you.

BRENDAN

(considers this)

She did, huh?

THE BRAIN

Fourth period, nearly shook me upside

down. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but

why'd she come to me?

BRENDAN

She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you

know me.

THE BRAIN

Yeah, well. She's some piece of work. If

I had known where you were I might have

told her.

BRENDAN

That's the spirit. Ask around for Dode,

tail Kara again at lunch. I got knives

in my eyes, I'm going home sick. I'll

call you tonight.

49

BRENDAN

I want to see the Pin.

TUGGER

(nods slightly)

Yeah, I guess you do.

50

EXT. STREETS

Twisty and narrow. The black mustang flies through them at

impossible speeds, roaring past like a bullet.

DARKNESS

Loud engine noise, jostling, grunting. Then a metallic

jangle, some scraping, and a CLINK!

EXT. REAR OF FAST MOVING MUSTANG - LATE AFTERNOON

The trunk pops open, revealing Brendan holding a jack rod.

INT. MOVING MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

Tug is putting a tape in the deck, eyes down. Behind him

the trunk pops open, then pulls down out of sight just as he

looks back up.

INT. TRUNK OF MOVING MUSTANG

Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough

to see which street signs pass by. Loud music plays from the

car -- "Sweet Baby James" by James Taylor.1

The car zooms on.

BRENDAN'S POV

Through the ajar trunk. The mustang slides to a stop beside

an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle's head.

Brendan closes the trunk.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

A small one story house, slightly run down. Tugger opens the

trunk and drags Brendan out, covering his eyes with a palm,

slams the trunk and goes inside.

When they are gone the broken trunk drifts open.

INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY

A very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one end,

dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the other

end. Tugger drags Brendan down the stairway, drops him and

goes into the lit room.

Unfortunately Mr. Taylor flatly refused, which, given the context, was probably wise.

51

TUGGER

Alright.

BRENDAN

You the Pin?

PIN

Yeah.

(beat of silence)

So now I'm very very curious what you're

going to say next.

BRENDAN

Maybe I'll just sit and bleed at you.

PIN

Helled if you're gonna go breaking my

best clients' noses and expect me to

play sandbag. Anyway you've been

sniffing me out before then, sniffing

for me like a vampire bat for a horse

52

with a nick on its ear he can suck on.

They do that.

(Brendan blinks)

So now you got Tugger to bring you here,

which he never does, and you got me

listening, so I'm curious what you've

got to say that better be really, really

good.

BRENDAN

Call Ms. Dannon in from the hall first;

she oughta hear this.

PIN

(amused)

No dice, soldier. Would have been a neat

trick, though.

BRENDAN

(shrugs, then slowly)

I was going to make up some bit of

information or set up some phony deal,

anything so you'd let me walk. Then I

was going to go to the vice principal

and spill him the street address of the

biggest dope port in the burgh.

TUGGER

He knows zippo.

BRENDAN

1250 Vista Blanca, the ink blotter at

the desk in the den in the basement of

the house with the tacky mailbox.

TUGGER

You gonna do what now?!

PIN

No good, soldier.

53

PIN (cont'd)

Alright, let up.

LAURA

(OS)

Tug, stop.

BRENDAN

Where are my glasses?

(Tugger grins)

Hell with ya then. Which wall's the door

in?

PIN

Sorry about this kid, but what the hell

with what you said before.

54

PIN (cont'd)

Where you were at, with all of us and

the Tug a fist away, you've got to use

your nut. Allay the situation, So yeah,

you're not scared of me, I got it, but

I'm also thinking you're a little nuts

now, so you've got that trade off with

your standing. But nuts isn't all bad,

so maybe it was a good play. I don't

know.

PIN (cont'd)

So, Laura talked me down. Let's get you

upstairs, back with the living.

MOTHER

I thought we had orange juice, Brendan,

I'm sorry. How about Tang, or that's

more like soda isn't it, or not soda but

it hasn't got any juice in it, it can't

be very fortifying.

BRENDAN

Water's fine, ma'am, thanks.

MOTHER

Now just a moment, we have apple juice

here, if you'd like that, or milk,

though you've got that in your

cornflakes, I don't know if drinking it

as well might be too much.

BRENDAN

Apple juice sounds terrific.

MOTHER

It's country style.

55

BRENDAN

That's perfect.

MOTHER

I'll even give it to you in a country

glass, how'd that be? Boys?

TUGGER

I'm fine, Mrs. M.

PIN

Thanks, mom.

MOTHER

Okay, well I'm going to go, um, do

something in the other room now...

PIN

(to Brendan)

So hows bout we take another snap at

hearing your tale?

BRENDAN

I don't know. It starts out same as

before, and this floor ain't carpeted.

PIN

We're cooled off.

BRENDAN

Yeah well, your muscle seemed plenty

cool putting his fist in my head. I want

him out.

PIN

Looky, soldier-

BRENDAN

The ape blows or I clam.

56

TUGGER

(stands violently)

So clam! What've you got I can't beat

out of you back in the basement?

PIN

Give us a few minutes, Tug.

PIN (cont'd)

I'll call you if whatever.

PIN (cont'd)

So?

BRENDAN

About a year ago I had a small time

dealing partnership with Jerr Madison.

Know him?

PIN

Till he took the fall for you.

BRENDAN

Yeah well. I didn't ask him to, but he

was a straight player. I got out clean -

almost. Nothing on my official record,

but the VPs play it like I owe them one.

When I made it clear I wasn't playing

their hound dog, well they didn't like

it. They keep calling me in, badgering

me.

PIN

Gee that's tough.

BRENDAN

I don't like being told whose side I'm

on. So now they think I'm on your trail,

I'm in a nice spot to know their

movements and feed them yours.

PIN

I gotcha.

57

BRENDAN

You haven't got me yet.

PIN

What, price?

BRENDAN

Considering the benefits my services

could yield, I don't think that's

unreasonable.

PIN

And what are your services exactly, just

so I can be specific on the invoice?

BRENDAN

(shrugs)

Whatever serves your interests.

PIN

Fair enough. I'll have my boys check

your tale, and seeing how it stretches

we'll either rub or hire you. You'll

know which by end of the day tomorrow.

PIN (cont'd)

We're done.

LAURA

I'll drive you back.

BRENDAN

Just drop me at school.

(they take a hard turn)

How long was I out?

LAURA

Half an hour. It took all of it for me

to cool the Pin down.

58

BRENDAN

(flatly, but sincerely)

Thanks.

They drive on in silence.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DUSK

Laura's convertible stops, and Brendan climbs out painfully.

He studies her face for a moment.

LAURA

You trust me now?

BRENDAN

Less than when I didn't trust you

before. If you can tell me your angle in

this, maybe I can.

LAURA

Come here.1

Brendan leans on the car, his face close to hers.

LAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd)

I'm on the in, top level of the tower

and I know everyone, but I don't know

all what goes on. I knew Em when she

tried to get with me and Brad, and I

liked her. She was smart. But she wasn't

us, and it didn't work. When she left

she took some souvenirs, dirty habits

she wasn't strong enough to control and

a connection to the Pin to keep them

going. With me?

BRENDAN

So far.

LAURA

A few months go by, and the next I hear

the Pin's raging over a situation with

some certain junk Em was partial to, and

the downfall's coming on Em's head.

BRENDAN

You think Em scraped the junk off the

Pin?

Not to weasel in a plug, but the original version of this scene (shot as written) is on the

59

LAURA

I don't know, but whether she scraped or

copped or just ran her tab around the

world and into her own back, it must

have been grand. I've never seen the Pin

so hot.

BRENDAN

This all helps but it's not what I

asked. What's your angle in all this?

LAURA

I don't know. I'm usually pretty sharp,

but... maybe I see what you're doing for

Emily, trying to help her. And I don't

know anyone who would do that for me.

BRENDAN

Now you are dangerous.

KARA

(sing song)

Brendan Brendan Brendan!

BRENDAN

Where's Dode flopped?

(she makes a face)

I know you two are cozed up, so you'll

tell me or you won't.

KARA

Oooh, getting feisty.

(giggles)

Last time we talked you were giving

ultimate-tims.

60

BRENDAN

It worked. You went to Laura, didn't

you? Told her my tale.

KARA

All part of your plan?

BRENDAN

Turned out to be.

KARA

I feel so cheap and used.

BRENDAN

Gol, I must seem a real cad. Sometimes I

just hate myself.

KARA

Whatever happened to us, Brendan?

BRENDAN

Where's Dode flopped?

KARA

We were a pair and a half for a few

months, weren't we? Sometimes I miss

having someone I can talk to. You ever

miss having someone? I guess you must.

BRENDAN

I need to hear Dode's tale about Emily.

It's important.

KARA

(darkly)

You better be sure you wanna know

whatcha wanna know.

BRENDAN

Uh huh. Laura's working with me now, and

I'll have the Pin and Tug in my corner

soon. The sooner I get the truth from

Dode or the truth about Dode from you,

the safer you'll both be. No? Pass it on

to Dode anyway. Maybe he'll have the

61

sense to get out from under you before

he gets hurt.

KARA

You didn't, did you?

THE BRAIN

(on the phone)

So what happens now?

BRENDAN

Now we wait for the Pin's answer. Unless

his crew spotted VP Truman's social call

this morning, it'll be yes. I'd give us

70/30. If we're in I get under his skin

and see what's what. You stick to Kara,

keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay

away from Laura.

THE BRAIN

I think she's with us, Brendan.

BRENDAN

(too sharp)

I'll let you know when she is.

THE BRAIN

Okay.

62

BRENDAN

You the Pin's?

BRENDAN (cont'd)

So what's his answer?

63

BRENDAN

Chuck Burns, big lug with hair like a

sheepdog.

THE BRAIN

(on the phone)

Yeah I know him, I just can't pin him to

any crowd. He's definitely not muscle

for anyone. He taps the Carrows crowd

but doesn't hang with them. If you've

got a guess I could check it out-

BRENDAN

The Pin. If he's with the Pin

everything's kablooie and I gotta blow

the burgh.

THE BRAIN

I'll check it. I'm in third now-

64

BRENDAN

Never mind. If I don't call by three

call in the bulls.

VOICE

Get in.

BRENDAN

So?

PIN

So. Tangles.

PIN (cont'd)

That's what you'll get every week for

your services. Less of course there's a

specific job involved, in where you get

sliced in with my crew. Square?

BRENDAN

Yeah.

PIN

We're doing a thing down at the Hole

tonight. Know it?

65

BRENDAN

South of T Street, yeah.

PIN

It's sort of a welcome you in thing.

Eight o'clock.

The car stops.

EXT. CAMPUS PAYPHONE - DAY

Brendan climbs out of the car on the exact spot they picked

him up. The Cady drives off. Brendan checks his watch.

BRENDAN'S WATCH

12:32. A phone begins to ring.

EXT. PICO & ALEXANDER - DAY

Brendan looks up from his watch and answers the payphone,

holding the receiver to his ear in silence.

VOICE

(on the phone)

I know what you did. I saw what you

did.1

The voice is low and garbled, filtered through something.

BRENDAN

So?

VOICE

Anyone I tell, it would ruin you some

way. And I'm going to tell someone.

BRENDAN

Are you making an offer?

VOICE

Maybe. Or maybe I'll just do you in.

BRENDAN

Hire another hash head to blade me?

Originally the source of this call was supposed to be a mystery, but during post

66

VOICE

Don't need no blades, shamus. I just

gotta squawk.

BRENDAN

What do you want?

VOICE

Just to see you sweat.

THE BRAIN

(on the phone)

Brendan?

BRENDAN

Yeah.

THE BRAIN

You alright?

BRENDAN

Yeah, I'm fine. Keep digging on the

Burns lug, but the main thing is to find

Dode. He set up whatever Emily walked

into, it's getting more and more urgent

we talk.

THE BRAIN

Alright. Trueman was looking for you.

BRENDAN

Trueman and the VP?

THE BRAIN

No, just Trueman.

BRENDAN

Asked for me?

THE BRAIN

No, but looked.

BRENDAN

That's not good. Alright, keep me

posted.

67

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT1

A bonfire burns about a hundred feet off. Figures jump

through the blaze to thrash music. The Pin and Brendan

wander towards us on the dark beach.

PIN

So I'm going to start you on the dope

circles, cleaning up the Turkish dues,

pulling in the strags.

BRENDAN

Small fries.

PIN

Yeah, well. Just to see how you handle.

Anyway there isn't much else doing. I'm

tailing out this big deal, but that's

almost done.

BRENDAN

Oh yeah? What was it?

PIN

Big time. Biggest I ever done, and there

was a snag in it, but it's almost done

now.

BRENDAN

What was it?

PIN

It's over.

BRENDAN

Almost, you said.

PIN

It's over enough. You're gonna make me

curious, being so curious.

They sit in the sand, facing the breakers.

PIN (cont'd)

I gotta lay something out. You're coming

into a certain situation, and I'm

bringing you in sort of because of it.

If ever you want to witness a look of pure horror, shoot a micro budget feature film and

68

(beat)

I didn't tell Tugger to hit you for the

Brad Bramish thing. Laura and I, I

decided I oughta hear what you were

gunning for before I made an enemy. Tug

just did it, though. He was hot, and he

just hit you. He's been doing that.

BRENDAN

Yeah?

PIN

He's got my best interests, I know, he's

loyal, he just gets hot.

BRENDAN

Muscle you can't control's no good at

that.

PIN

You're working for me, not Tug, that's

all.

BRENDAN

Alright.

PIN

Things can get, you know, it's tough

sometimes. Twisted, complicated,

watching all the, I don't know.

Everyone's got their thing.

(silence)

You read Tolkien?

BRENDAN

What?

PIN

Tolkien, the Hobbit books?

BRENDAN

Yeah.

PIN

His descriptions of things are really

good.

BRENDAN

Oh yeah?

69

PIN

He makes you want to be there.

THE BRAIN

(on the phone)

Don't go to class.

BRENDAN

What?

THE BRAIN

Fifth period Trueman and the VP come in

asking for you.

BRENDAN

Agh.

THE BRAIN

Did they call your mom?

BRENDAN

Probably. I got home late.

THE BRAIN

Get out of there too, then. Meet me

behind the library. I've got some stuff.

THE BRAIN

Frisco Farr was found on a sidewalk

outside Pinkerton's Deli three weeks

ago. He was in a coma, his stomach

contained a sausage sandwich, a horse

dose of Heroin and traces of Choleric

Tricemate, a poisonous chemical found in

laundry detergent. Frisco's still under

70

and nobody's talking, so nothing's come

of it.

BRENDAN

OD?

THE BRAIN

No, the chem the junk must have been cut

with put him down.

BRENDAN

Huh. Bad junk. Bad brick... could that

form of Heroin be called 'Brick'?

THE BRAIN

No -- it was a concentrated powder, its

street handle's 'whip' or 'rock' or

'brock'.

(fishes a note from his

pocket)

Here. From Laura.

BRENDAN

I told you to stay clear of Laura.

THE BRAIN

You tell her to stay clear of me?

BRENDAN

(mutters)

I gotta get voicemail.

BRENDAN (cont'd)

No. Tell her I'll be at the Pin's at

one. Any luck with the lug?

THE BRAIN

No.

BRENDAN

This isn't good.

71

BRENDAN (cont'd)

(into phone)

Mr. Trueman please.

TRUEMAN

(on the phone)

This is Trueman.

BRENDAN

What the hell are you doing asking for

me in class?

TRUEMAN

What the hell are you doing out of

class?

BRENDAN

What?

TRUEMAN

(very deliberate)

The VP and I needed to ask you a few

questions about Emily Kostich, who you

might have heard is missing. It's a very

serious thing. The police are involved.

The VP and I knew you two were close, so

the VP and I came to ask you questions,

but you were truant. If you don't have a

valid excuse-

THE BRAIN

What?

BRENDAN

I've been cut loose. I'm not safe here.

We shouldn't have met in the open.

Alright, lay low, but ask on the

underneath for Dode. That's all that

matters now, find Dode, but do it on the

underneath, got it?

THE BRAIN

What are you going to do?

BRENDAN

I'd like to have played it safe, but

there's no time. The Pin's not letting

72

anything drop, so I gotta push things a

bit.

THE BRAIN

How?

BRENDAN

I don't know. Just find Dode.

73

TUGGER

What with the poking, genius?! Maybe

you're poking for your bull friends!

BRENDAN

Don't be a sap. I can't even face up at

school, the VP's so hot for me.

TUGGER

Yeah well. Maybe you're looking to make

good.

BRENDAN

I'm looking to find this big game the

Pin's played, not to gum it, but just so

when its tail jams in my back I'll know

who to bill for the embalming.

TUGGER

You oughta ask him what you wanna know.

BRENDAN

I did. He didn't tell me.

74

BRENDAN (cont'd)

When a gee I'm paid to side with won't

give me the straight that makes me

nervous. Makes me angry.

TUGGER

Yeah, well. That's understandable.

TUGGER

There was ten of them. I don't know

where he picked them, he didn't tell me.

BRENDAN

(sympathetic)

Huh.

TUGGER

So we get ten kils of brock, there aint

enough marks in the whole burgh to eat

that. So he unloads eight of em up way

north, even up to the docks. I don't

know who.

BRENDAN

Didn't tell you.

TUGGER

Yeah. That was eight. So that's the

tenth in there. We gotta break it into

doses, sell em off round the high, maybe

some by Shorecliffs.

BRENDAN

What about the ninth brick?

TUGGER

Ah yeah. There were problems with that.

BRENDAN

Yeah?

TUGGER

It, uh...

75

TUGGER (cont'd)

(quickly)

It disappeared. Someone skimmed it. We

started raising hell with all the likely

suspects, and whatayaknow, it came back.

But it came back bad. One of ours took a

dose off the top, and it laid him out.

BRENDAN

Frisco.

TUGGER

Yeah, poor Frisco. You heard about that.

We'll track down the rat. Just takes

time.

BRENDAN

I heard something fell with Emily

Kostich.

TUGGER

Emily who?

BRENDAN

Kostich.

TUGGER

Don't know her.

BRENDAN

Huh.

TUGGER

Has the Pin talked about her?

BRENDAN

Not to me.

TUGGER

Yeah, he might know something. Ask him.

Tell me what he says, cause if you heard

something, you know, I wanna check.

BRENDAN

Sure.

76

PIN

Pow wowing?

BRENDAN

Just shooting the shat.

TUGGER

Yeah, just shooting it.

PIN

Good.

PIN (cont'd)

You alright, soldier?

PIN (cont'd)

So, Tug, I got a call. Someone who says

they know something about Emily.

TUGGER

Emily?

PIN

Emily Kostich. Where she's at now. Says

we'd want to know. Wants to meet.

TUGGER

(uncomfortable)

Yeah?

PIN

So we'll meet him. Four o'clock.

(to Brendan)

Emily was Tug's girl for awhile. You

know Emily, didn't you?

BRENDAN

A while back.

PIN

You've heard she's missing?

BRENDAN

Yeah, I heard that.

PIN

So maybe you want to come along too.

77

BRENDAN

What has Emily got to do with you?

PIN

(looks at Tugger)

Show, maybe we'll find out.

PIN (cont'd)

Four o'clock.

BRENDAN

That's my ride.

PIN

Four o'clock.

BRENDAN

(roughly)

A payphone, anywhere.

LAURA

What-

PAYPHONE

The mobile customer you have called is

away from the phone-

78

BRENDAN

(barks shakily)

What time is it?

LAURA

Lie down, Brendan-

BRENDAN

What time-

LAURA

You've got a fever, you've got to go to

the hospital or-

BRENDAN

What time is it?

LAURA

Three forty. You've got to rest, you're

feverish.

LAURA

Get back in the car, I'm taking you

home, you're sick, you need-

BRENDAN

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

BRENDAN (cont'd)

Okay, you've got to, what you've got to

do is drive around to the Carrows lot.

79

I'll be up on the, the blacktop, the

basketball field. So you've got to go by

you or me to get down there. If you see

anyone but the Pin or Tugger or their

crew go down into the ravine, honk four

times, long short long short. But don't

be seen.

LAURA

Get back in the car.

BRENDAN

Do it! Will you do it? I need you to do

this. I need you, here. Please.

BRENDAN

What are you doing, Dode?

DODE

You gonna stop me?

BRENDAN

What do you think you're doing, Dode?

DODE

I saw you. I saw what you did.

BRENDAN

What'd you see?

DODE

I saw you.

BRENDAN

What'd you see me?

80

DODE

You were with her, dead, and you took

the body.

BRENDAN

Yeah, I did. That's all you saw? What

about before?

DODE

Before what?

BRENDAN

Did you see who killed her before I got

there?

DODE

(face ashen)

You killed her.

BRENDAN

I found the body, Dode.

DODE

You, I thought you didn't, but we

figured out, I got the news on ya, cause

you hid the body, why wouldn't-

BRENDAN

Who's 'we'?

DODE

Shut up! You're always talking, always

this and that smartso, you're gonna shut

up now!

BRENDAN

I didn't kill her, Dode.

DODE

You're not going to talk this!

BRENDAN

Dode, I know you're thinking of Em, I

know you tried to help her-

DODE

Shut up! You're gonna shut your

DODE (cont'd)

put it over real nice-

81

BRENDAN

-so I'm telling you now you're in over

your head, you don't want to put your

hand in this-

DODE

Shut up! She's dead, you-

BRENDAN

Why was she scared, Dode? She came to

me, who was she scared of? I think I

know why, I just gotta know who!

DODE

You're trying to confuse me.

BRENDAN

Dode.

DODE

You couldn't stand it. Your little Em.

She was gonna keep it, it was mine, and

you couldn't stand that.

BRENDAN

What was yours?

DODE

I had you pegged.

BRENDAN

What was yours?

DODE

I loved her. And I woulda loved the kid.

I'm gonna bury you.

82

BRENDAN

What'd I miss?

PIN

Dode here says Emily Kostich is dead.

BRENDAN

Oh yeah?

PIN

Yeah. He says he knows who did it. He

says he knows where the body's at.

(beat of silence)

And he says he wants more money than I

think the information's worth.

BRENDAN

That so, Dode?

(to the Pin)

83

So walk. What's the info have to do with

you anyways?

DODE

Plenty.

PIN

Plenty, he says.

BRENDAN

Uh huh. And he wants cash on the nail.

He's a pot skulled reef worm with more

hop in his head than blood. Why pay for

dirt you can't believe?

DODE

You'll believe this.

BRENDAN

(shrugs)

Maybe you will.

DODE

You'll believe it, cause it's someone

close to you. Real close.

BRENDAN

Maybe it's hot, but it's Dode, you can't

trust it.

DODE

Real close.

BRENDAN

I'm getting my shoes wet for this. Let

him milk you if you want.

PIN

(to Brendan)

Stay.

(to Dode)

It's still too much.

DODE

No it's not. You won't complain when you

hear it.

84

BRENDAN

(murmurs)

So maybe you should.

DODE

You had her against the wall with the

brick -

PIN

I know my business. It's still too much.

DODE

(with growing confidence)

It's not, cause that's not why she was

killed, and it's real important to you,

cause the person who killed her's real

close, and cause he's got a lot to lose,

and he knows if I don't bury him by

spilling to you I spill to the bulls and

bury him for real, and he's really

really scared - she had a kid in her and

he couldn't stand -

BRENDAN

Tug, it's alright!

PIN

Tug, stop.

85

PIN (cont'd)

(thickly)

Tug...

FADE OUT

FADE IN:

TUGGER

She sprung it on me, just. That's a hell

of a thing to spring on a guy. I don't

remember much. Laura talked me down

after, said whatever, she knew her, said

it wasn't true, but I still think

sometimes. I think bout it being true.

Bout it being mine. And maybe I did it

cause I thought it was true. A hell of a

thing.

TUGGER (cont'd)

You up? You weren't doing too good there

for awhile. Laura said take you, you

know, hospital, but I couldn't.

BRENDAN

What's the stats?

86

TUGGER

Everyone's just laying low. You're here

with us, at my folks place. They're

gone. The bulls got Dode fore the tide

took his body.

BRENDAN

Tide?

TUGGER

Yeah, strong tide, would've taken the

body, like out to sea. It can do that.

But the fuzz got there first.

TUGGER (cont'd)

So everyone's assuming it's war, but no

one's said it yet. Everyone's lying low.

BRENDAN

War?

TUGGER

You're with us.

BRENDAN

The hell I am.

BRENDAN (cont'd)

Alright, I'm with you.

TUGGER

So just lie low. Sleep some more. Laura,

she said you should sleep.

BRENDAN

Hey.

87

THE BRAIN

(on phone)

Brendan?

BRENDAN

Yeah.

THE BRAIN

Are you - what, man, have you heard

about Dode-

BRENDAN

I was there.

THE BRAIN

You-

BRENDAN

Where were you yesterday? I called.

THE BRAIN

Kasprzyk took my phone, turned it off. I

just now got it back.

BRENDAN

Alright, listen-

THE BRAIN

Are you okay?

BRENDAN

Just listen. Is my name in the papers

with the story?

THE BRAIN

No.

BRENDAN

Alright. Is it just Dode in the papers?

THE BRAIN

Yeah. What do you mean?

88

BRENDAN

Listen, I'm going to be calling you

tonight, probably late. Sleep with your

phone on. Could you get a car if you

needed to?

THE BRAIN

If it's late enough I could take my

mom's-

BRENDAN

Be ready then. I'll call.

THE BRAIN

Alright.

KARA

Brendan. Did you hear about Dode?

BRENDAN

You scheming tramp. You set that poor

kid up, you hid him, fed him your tale.

You got info from Laura and held Dode

like a card till you could play him. For

money!

KARA

I don't know what you're talking about.

BRENDAN

You'd bury me at the same time, but it

was mostly for the money. You got Dode

thinking Em had his kid, thinking I did

it, and that was enough for him, but he

stuck to the money cause you had your

claws in him, cause he couldn't come

away from the deal without it and make

you happy.

KARA

Sit down, you're a mess. Russ, go get my

shoes from the wardrobe locker, would

you sweetie?

89

He goes, trying to look mean at Brendan. Brendan and Kara

watch each other like caged rats.

KARA (cont'd)

Still wish you knew what you wanted to

know? If it's any consolation, it

probably wasn't Dode's kid. It might

have been Tug's, but frankly I wouldn't

bet a horse - it was a crowded field

there at the end.

Brendan grabs a clock and throws it. Kara's mirror shatters,

revealing a grimy dark wall behind.

KARA (cont'd)

Meany. You want my tale, Brendan? I

still know what Dode was selling, but

I'd play it smart. A quick call from a

payphone to copland, they drag the

tunnel and you're through.

She comes very close to him. Her robe falls open slightly.

KARA (cont'd)

Five thousand. Cash. I know you can get

it from the Pin, but even if you can't I

want it by first period tomorrow, or I

play my hand and bury you.

She turns away, lets her robe fall.1

KARA (cont'd)

Now get out.

Brendan's eyes burn. He lunges at her.

EXT. BACKSTAGE - SAME

Drama geeks sit in groups. The dressing room door flies open

and Kara flies out, stark naked. Brendan flies out after

her.

KARA

What are you doing?

BRENDAN

Showing your ace.

Brendan storms out.

Also on the DVD. Fine retailers everywhere.

90

VOICE

Far enough.

PIN

Everyone's paying social calls.

BRENDAN

Laura here?

PIN

So?

BRENDAN

So what are the stats?

PIN

The stats are war, soon as the press

heat dies. And if you're with him,

you're with him.

BRENDAN

Tug got hot. He panicked.

PIN

Tug's been after my digs from the get

go.

BRENDAN

No. He's been anxious cause he thought

if you found out he killed Emily you'd

turn him over.

PIN

He was right.

BRENDAN

Yeah, well.

PIN

I told him to get the straight, no

roughing. I wasn't even there.

91

BRENDAN

Alright. So he's a hot head. So you

don't want him on your side, at least

let's have a pow wow fore we start

digging trenches. Maybe we can all walk

away amiable enemies. What would it

take?

PIN

I don't know. We'd have to square

everything between us. He owes me some

money.

BRENDAN

Alright, but we can talk.

PIN

Yeah, alright.

BRENDAN

Four o'clock.

PIN

Tomorrow?

BRENDAN

Tonight. Let's clear it all before it

boils up again.

PIN

Four tonight. You'll be here?

BRENDAN

Yeah.

LAURA (OS)

Wait!

LAURA (cont'd)

I'll drive you back.

LAURA

What's going to happen?

92

LAURA (cont'd)

Do you feel better?

BRENDAN

(weak)

I don't know.

TUGGER

For a smart guy you aint too smart. I

said lay low.

LAURA

Tug.

BRENDAN

She was at the Pin's.

TUGGER

Yeah, she's our go-between.

BRENDAN

Uh huh. So here's the sit. You and the

Pin are going to pow wow, four o'clock

tonight, his place. Take all the muscle

you want, you won't need it. He wants to

talk straight, and you're going to work

with him for whatever he needs, cause

you don't want war.

TUGGER

Hell I don't.

BRENDAN

The Pin's sitting on the brick profits -

hitting him now would be post. Make

peace and wait for your chance.

LAURA

He's right, Tug. Smooth it out.

93

BRENDAN

(between coughs)

Besides, he's got you on the Dode thing.

War'll mean you vs. him and every bull

in the burgh.

TUGGER

Yeah, we'll talk.

LAURA

(to Brendan)

You going?

BRENDAN

Yeah.

BRENDAN

(croaks)

Go away.

LAURA

I'm sorry Brendan.

94

LAURA

Don't go tonight.

BRENDAN

I've got to make sure it plays out

smooth.

LAURA

It'll play however it plays without you

there.

BRENDAN

I've got to make sure.

LAURA

Why?

BRENDAN

Cause if there's war, I'm in it too.

LAURA

Well let's just, I mean why not just run

away. Go somewhere. I've got a car.

(Brendan gives a wry look)

I've got an aunt in New Orleans, she

wouldn't care.

(Brendan grins)

Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think

about it, why not? What, school? C'mon.

Family?

BRENDAN

Alright, stop.

LAURA

I wasn't serious, but we could go for

awhile. Just until everything clears.

95

BRENDAN

Tell your boys no knuckle business.

TUGGER

They're just ready.

BRENDAN

Your folks left a car here?

TUGGER

Yeah.

BRENDAN

Take it and Laura's.

(Brendan tosses Tug the keys)

I'll go first in yours.

TUGGER

The hell-

BRENDAN

I'll take the scenic route to draw off

any tailers. They'll think it's you,

they might even radio back that you're

alone. Get it?

TUGGER

Mr. Smarts.

BRENDAN

Alright. Got a cigarette?

TUGGER

No. I don't smoke.

BRENDAN

I've seen you smoke.

96

TUGGER

I don't smoke cigarettes.

BRENDAN

Give me fifteen minutes, then go.

THE BRAIN

(on phone)

Yeah.

BRENDAN

Alright, I warned you. Can you get the

car?

THE BRAIN

Yeah.

BRENDAN

Go to 2014 Clancy, off Pico west of La

Grange. Park outside and wait. Laura's

inside. She hasn't got a car, but if she

blows on foot or gets a pick, tail her.

Alright?

(silence)

Alright?

THE BRAIN

Okay.

BRENDAN

I'll call you when it gets light.

(silence)

Thanks, Brain.

97

BRENDAN

Talk.

PIN

I want full assurance that any heat from

Emily and Dode is gonna be on just you.

I don't even want my name pulled in the

shindig. Second, you owe me six Cs, no

rush, but I want your shake that it'll

come home in not too much time.

BRENDAN

(to Tug)

That's square. You did them after all.

Lay low it'll blow over. Stick on this,

one of you'll dish it to bury the other

and you'll both get the rap. As to the

six, did you borrow it?

TUGGER

Yeah.

BRENDAN

Then you owe it. Shouldn't need a shake

on that.

TUGGER

Alright to both.

98

BRENDAN

Good. Let's seal it up and blow for

keeps.

PIN

Third thing. The last brick.

BRENDAN

It's yours.

PIN

That aint the point. I'm gonna start

selling it. How do I know it aint bad?

BRENDAN

Why would it be?

PIN

Why was the last one? Cause someone got

greedy. Tug here's had the means to

swipe half and cut it bad for a long

time. Now we're splits my loss of

trust's retroactive.

BRENDAN

Did you, Tug?

TUGGER

(eyes hot on the Pin)

No.

BRENDAN

Alright, so let's shake and blow.

PIN

Not good enough.

BRENDAN

What would be good enough?

PIN

I wanna see him dose it. Just to prove

it. Then we're square.

TUGGER

Hell for that! I didn't touch your junk,

that's it.

99

PIN

I wanna see it.

TUGGER

To hell!

PIN

Your not wanting to dose it's telling me

something right here.

TUGGER

Yeah, it better be! It's telling that

I'm out from your thumb, that I aint

playing lapdog to no gothed up cripple

no more!

BRENDAN

I'll dose it.

PIN

What?

BRENDAN

If it'll shut you two apes up I'll   take

the dose, and if I don't die we're   all

right as rain, and if I do die you   two

have your war, so long as you keep   it

off my grave. Deal?

PIN

Fine.   Tangles.

BRENDAN

Johnny, go with him.

100

BRENDAN (cont'd)

No!

TANGLES

(gasping)

The brick, it's gone. The brick's gone.

PIN

Make peace, huh? Talk it out? Get your

boys in my den soes you could snag it

under my nose?

TUGGER

Alright!

BRENDAN

No, that's not-

PIN

Was it bad, Tug? Snag it so I don't

know, or sell it off to flat the war

odds?

BRENDAN

(shouts)

Pin, think about it-

TUGGER

Alright, I did all that!

101

TUGGER (cont'd)

I cut the brick, I stole the money, I

faked a peace, I snagged your junk, I

did it all!

PIN

Do him!

PIN (cont'd)

Do him now!

102

FADE OUT

FADE IN:

103

BRENDAN

Hey. Where are you?

THE BRAIN

(on phone)

Library. Where are you?

BRENDAN

Did she blow last night?

THE BRAIN

No. Stayed there till six thirty, then

walked to school.

BRENDAN

You didn't give her a ride, did you?

THE BRAIN

No.

BRENDAN

But she came straight to school from

Tug's?

THE BRAIN

Yeah.

BRENDAN

She there now?

THE BRAIN

Yeah. Not with me, but here.

BRENDAN

Alright. Tell her I wanna meet up on the

basketball field in half an hour, then

go home and get some sleep.

THE BRAIN

Alright.

104

LAURA

(softly)

Did you see it all? With Tug and the

Pin?

BRENDAN

No. I took your advice and didn't go.

LAURA

(confused)

No?

BRENDAN

What happened?

LAURA

The papers say six dead, three around

the house, one girl in the trunk of

Tug's car, and the Pin and Tug.

BRENDAN

Yeah?

LAURA

Tug tried to shoot his way out when the

police got there. They tied him to Dode,

too. Same gun. And the girl.

BRENDAN

Huh.

LAURA

Well good thing you weren't there.

105

BRENDAN

Yeah.

LAURA

You think the girl was Emily?

BRENDAN

Probably.

LAURA

You loved her.

BRENDAN

(distant)

Yeah I did.

LAURA

You did all this cause you loved her.

And now it's finished.

(tightens her embrace)

I love you.

BRENDAN

No.

LAURA

What?

BRENDAN

No, it's not finished. Tug pulled the

trigger on Em and he got the fall, but

the bulls coulda found that out without

me.

BRENDAN (cont'd)

I set out to know who put her in the

spot, who put her in front of the gun.

That was you, angel.

LAURA

(drifting back further)

What are you talking about?

106

BRENDAN

It was you. What, you want the whole

tale? You want me to tell it to you?

LAURA

(bewildered)

Tell it to me.

BRENDAN

Alright, from the top. You had your

fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances

and to keep him buying from the Pin, who

you were hooked with. Emily came to you

and Brad, you saw her for what she was,

an insecure little girl trying to get

in. She goes on the backburner.

Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored,

maybe just greedy, so when the Pin

scores big with the bricks you take your

shot. You hook one, take half, and cut

it back to size, but you cut it bad.

Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the

Pin's operation, doesn't matter. You put

it back, but poor Frisco doses off it

and lands in a coma.

(voice strengthening)

So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's

jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's

crowd looking for blood, or at least a

scape. You know trouble. There's going

to be a war over this. And there's

Emily. She trusts you. She wants in.

It's duck soup.

LAURA

(murmurs)

No.

BRENDAN

You frame her for the bad brick, then

you cut her loose. You turn on your heel

and bite her in the throat. Last week on

the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she

saw something she was scared of. Tug's

car driving by, the Pin driving, but she

wouldn't have seen the Pin. No, she was

across the street, angel. She saw the

passenger side. She saw you. She saw you

and ran like she saw some devil.

107

LAURA

Brendan, why are you-

BRENDAN

And she took the hit. Dode hid her away,

but the Pin was on to her, tracked her

down, told her to meet him, that they

would make good. Gave her a time, and a

place. And sent Tug. Just to get the

straight. But maybe you had talked Tug

up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em

sprung it on him that she had her kid,

and he did what anyone could count on

Tug doing - he hit her. She took the hit

for you. You let her take it.

LAURA

Stop it!

BRENDAN

That's the tale.

LAURA

Stop it!

BRENDAN

You're going to tell me it's not?

LAURA

It's not!

BRENDAN

Look at me.

LAURA

You know me. I've only helped you. How

can you - It isn't true!

BRENDAN

I hope it isn't. I want you to have been

on my side all along, not just trying to

get me under your thumb like Brad and

the Pin and Tug.

LAURA

No-

108

BRENDAN

But I think you knew that meeting was

going to blow up. I think that was your

final play. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope

everything I wrote in the note I dropped

at Gary Trueman's office this morning is

wrong. About your and Brad's involvement

in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't

steal the brick last night. In your

purse.

LAURA

(breathes)

I didn't.

BRENDAN

That's good. That means you didn't let

me walk into a slaughterhouse. You

didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their

crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman

reads the note, takes my cue and

searches your locker, he won't find a

damn thing.

LAURA

(murmurs)

Brendan... don't...

BRENDAN

(gently)

It's done.

109

LAURA

Done. Well. That's most of it. 9 out of

10. I told Em to tell Tug it was his.

Told her it would soften him up. She

said she wished she could keep it, but

she didn't love the father. I was going

to drive her down the next day, we'd

found a doctor. Most wouldn't. She was

starting to show. 3 months. You know

whose kid that makes it, or have you

known all along?

LAURA (cont'd)

Mother-

BRENDAN

You get your straight?

THE BRAIN

Yeah. I wouldn't have-

BRENDAN

S'alright.

THE BRAIN

Yeah, well. Chuck Burns came to. The

knife guy. Spilled it all to the bulls,

guess Brad Bramish hired him. On his

own, just a grudge thing.

BRENDAN

(nods slightly)

Fits. You did good, Brain. Go sleep.

THE BRAIN

Yeah, you too.

110

THE BRAIN (cont'd)

What'd she whisper to you?

BRENDAN

She called me a dirty word.

THE BRAIN

Alright, you don't have to tell me.

Thick.

BRENDAN

As what-all.

Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field, watching

Laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks

off behind a twisted chain linked fence.

The first period bell rings, and Brendan walks back

towards campus.

FADE OUT.
