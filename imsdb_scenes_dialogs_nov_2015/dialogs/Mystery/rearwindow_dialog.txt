Final Draft

December 1, 1953

ANNOUNCER

The time -- 7:15 A.M., WOR, New York.

The temperature, outside, 84 --

Friends -- is your life worth one

dollar?

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

GUNNISON

(Looks up)

Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would

go sky-high.

BRYCE

From the looks of Davidson's cable,

it might even go higher than that.

And we haven't even got a camera

over there.

GUNNISON

(Stands)

This could go off in a month -- or

an hour.

BRYCE

I'll pull somebody out of Japan.

GUNNISON

(Heads for his phone)

Bryce, the only man for this job is

sitting right here in town.

(Picks up phone)

Get me L. B. Jefferies.

BRYCE

(Puzzled)

Jefferies?

GUNNISON

(To Bryce; still

holding phone)

Name me a better photographer.

BRYCE

(He can't)

But his leg!

GUNNISON

Don't worry -- it comes off today.

GUNNISON

I mean the cast.

(To phone)

JEFF

Jefferies.

GUNNISON

(On filter)

Congratulations, Jeff.

JEFF

For what?

GUNNISON

For getting rid of that cast.

JEFF

Who said I was getting rid of it?

GUNNISON

(With logical proof)

This is Wednesday.

JEFF

Gunnison -- how did you get to be

such a big editor -- with such a

small memory?

GUNNISON

Wrong day?

JEFF

Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge

from this plaster cocoon.

GUNNISON

That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess

I can't be lucky every day. Forget I

called.

JEFF

Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you,

Gunnison. Must be rough on you

thinking of me wearing this cast

another whole week.

GUNNISON

That one week is going to cost me my

best photographer -- and you a big

assignment.

JEFF

Where?

GUNNISON

There's no point in even talking

about it.

JEFF

(Insistent)

Where?

GUNNISON

(Filter)

Indo-China. Got a code tip from the

bureau chief this morning. The place

is about to go up in smoke.

JEFF

(Pleased; excited)

Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you

it was the next place to watch?

GUNNISON

You did.

JEFF

(On filter)

Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An

hour?

GUNNISON

With that cast on -- you don't.

JEFF

(On filter)

Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take

pictures from a jeep. From a water

buffalo if necessary.

GUNNISON

You're too valuable to the magazine

for us to play around with. I'll

send Morgan or Lambert.

JEFF

Swell. I get myself half-killed for

you -- and you reward me by stealing

my assignments.

GUNNISON

I didn't ask you to stand in the

middle of that automobile race track.

JEFF

(A little angry)

You asked for something dramatically

different! You got it!

GUNNISON

(Quietly)

So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.

JEFF

(Won't let him hang

up)

You've got to get me out of here!

Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room

apartment with nothing to do but

look out the window at the neighbors!

JEFF

It's worse than the Chinese water

torture.

GUNNISON

Read some good books.

JEFF

I've been taking pictures so long I

don't know how to read anymore.

GUNNISON

I'll send you some comic books.

JEFF

(Low, tense)

Listen -- if you don't pull me out

of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do

something drastic.

GUNNISON

Like what?

JEFF

(On filter)

I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll

never be able to go anywhere.

GUNNISON

It's about time you got married --

before you turn into a lonesome and

bitter old man.

JEFF

Can you see me -- rushing home to a

hot apartment every night to listen

to the automatic laundry, the electric

dishwasher, the garbage disposal and

a nagging wife.

GUNNISON

Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore --

they discuss.

JEFF

Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts

they discuss -- but in my

neighborhood, they still nag.

GUNNISON

Well -- you know best. Call you later,

Jeff.

JEFF

Next time, have some good news.

STELLA

(Loud)

The New York State sentence for a

peeping Tom is six months in the

workhouse!

JEFF

Hello Stella.

STELLA

And there aren't any windows in the

workhouse.

STELLA

Years ago, they used to put out your

eyes with a hot poker. Is one of

those bikini bombshells you always

watch worth a hot poker?

STELLA

We've grown to be a race of peeping

Toms. What people should do is stand

outside their own houses and look in

once in a while.

(She looks up at him)

What do you think of that for homespun

philosophy?

JEFF

Readers' Digest, April, 1939.

STELLA

Well, I only quote from the best.

JEFF

Now look, Stella --

STELLA

See it you can break a hundred.

STELLA

I shoulda been a Gypsy fortune teller,

instead of an insurance company nurse.

I got a nose for trouble -- can smell

it ten miles away.

(Stops, looks at him)

You heard of the stock market crash

in '29?

STELLA

I predicted it.

JEFF

(Around thermometer)

How?

STELLA

Simple. I was nursing a director of

General Motors. Kidney ailment they

said. Nerves, I said. Then I asked

myself -- what's General Motors got

to be nervous about?

(Snaps her fingers)

Overproduction. Collapse, I answered.

When General Motors has to go to the

bathroom ten times a day -- the whole

country's ready to let go.

JEFF

Stella -- in economics, a kidney

ailment has no relationship to the

stock market. Absolutely none.

STELLA

It crashed, didn't it?

STELLA

I can smell trouble right in this

apartment. You broke your leg. You

look out the window. You see things

you shouldn't. Trouble. I can see

you now, in front of the judge,

flanked by lawyers in blue double-

breasted suits. You're pleading,

"Judge, it was only innocent fun. I

love my neighbors like a father." --

The Judge answers, "Congratulations.

You just gave birth to three years

in Dannemora."

JEFF

Right now I'd even welcome trouble.

STELLA

(Flatly)

You've got a hormone deficiency.

JEFF

How can you tell that from a

thermometer!

STELLA

Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch

haven't raised your temperature one

degree in four weeks.

JEFF

I think you're right. There is going

to be some trouble around here.

STELLA

I knew it!

JEFF

Don't you ever heat that stuff up.

STELLA

Gives your circulation something to

fight.

(Begins massaging his

back)

What kind of trouble?

JEFF

Lisa Fremont.

STELLA

You must be kidding. A beautiful

young woman, and you a reasonably

healthy specimen of manhood.

JEFF

She expects me to marry her.

STELLA

That's normal.

JEFF

I don't want to.

STELLA

(Slaps cold oils on

him)

That's abnormal.

JEFF

(Wincing)

I'm not ready for marriage.

STELLA

Nonsense. A man is always ready for

marriage -- with the right girl. And

Lisa Fremont is the right girl for

any man with half a brain, who can

get one eye open.

JEFF

(Indifferent)

She's all right.

STELLA

Behind every ridiculous statement is

always hidden the true cause.

(Peers at him)

What is it? You have a fight?

JEFF

No.

STELLA

(After a pause)

Her father loading up the shotgun?

JEFF

Stella!

STELLA

It's happened before, you know! Some

of the world's happiest marriage

have started 'under the gun' you

might say.

JEFF

She's just not the girl for me.

STELLA

She's only perfect.

JEFF

Too perfect. Too beautiful, too

talented, too sophisticated, too

everything -- but what I want.

STELLA

(Cautiously)

Is what you want something you can

discuss?

JEFF

It's very simple. She belongs in

that rarefied atmosphere of Park

Avenue, expensive restaurants, and

literary cocktail parties.

STELLA

People with sense can belong wherever

they're put.

JEFF

Can you see her tramping around the

world with a camera bum who never

has more than a week's salary in the

bank?

(Almost to himself)

If only she was ordinary.

STELLA

You're never going to marry?

JEFF

Probably. But when I do, it'll be to

someone who thinks of life as more

than a new dress, a lobster dinner,

and the latest scandal. I need a

woman who'll go anywhere, do anything,

and love it.

JEFF

The only honest thing to do is call

it off. Let her look for somebody

else.

STELLA

I can just hear you now. "Get out of

here you perfect, wonderful woman!

You're too good for me!"

JEFF

(After pause)

That's the hard part.

STELLA

Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated.

I'm not even sophisticated. But I

can tell you this -- when a man and

a woman see each other, and like

each other -- they should come

together -- wham like two taxies on

Broadway. Not sit around studying

each other like specimens in at

bottle.

JEFF

There's an intelligent way to approach

marriage.

STELLA

(Scoffing)

Intelligence! Nothing has caused the

human race more trouble. Modern

marriage!

JEFF

We've progressed emotionally in --

STELLA

(Interrupting)

Baloney! Once it was see somebody,

get excited, get married -- Now,

it's read books, fence with four

syllable words, psychoanalyze each

other until you can't tell a petting

party from a civil service exam

JEFF

People have different emotional levels

that --

STELLA

(Interrupting again)

Ask for trouble and you get it. Why

there's a good boy in my neighborhood

who went with a nice girl across the

street for three years. Then he

refused to marry her. Why? -- Because

she only scored sixty-one on a Look

Magazine marriage quiz!

STELLA

When I married Myles, we were both

maladjusted misfits. We still are.

And we've loved every minute of it.

JEFF

That's fine, Stella. Now would you

make me a sandwich?

STELLA

Okay -- but I'm going to spread some

common sense on the bread. Lisa

Fremont's loaded to her fingertips

with love for you. I'll give you two

words of advice. Marry her.

JEFF

(Smiles)

She pay you much?

STELLA

(Quietly)

Window shopper.

FADE OUT:

LISA

(Softly)

How's your leg?

JEFF

Mmmm -- hurts a little.

LISA

And your stomach?

JEFF

Empty as a football.

LISA

And you love life?

JEFF

Not too active.

LISA

Anything else bothering you?

JEFF

Uh-huh.

LISA

(As she moves)

Reading from top to bottom --

(Light on)

Lisa --

LISA

Carol --

LISA

Fremont.

JEFF

The Lisa Fremont who never wears the

same dress twice?

LISA

Only because it's expected of her.

LISA

Right off the Paris plane. Think it

will sell?

JEFF

Depends on the quote. Let's see --

there's the plane tickets over, import

duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --

LISA

-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.

JEFF

(A low whistle)

That dress should be listed on the

stock exchange.

LISA

We sell a dozen a day in this price

range.

JEFF

Who buys them? Tax collectors?

LISA

Even if I had to pay, it would be

worth it -- just for the occasion.

JEFF

(Off -- puzzled)

Something big going on somewhere?

LISA

(Looking up from the

table)

Going on right here. It's a big night.

JEFF

(Off)

It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday.

The calendar's loaded with them.

LISA

It's opening night of the last

depressing week of L. B. Jefferies

in a cast.

JEFF

(Off)

Hasn't been any big demand for

tickets.

LISA

(Smiling)

That's because I bought out the house.

This cigarette box has seen better

days.

JEFF

Picked it up in Shanghai -- which

has also seen better days.

LISA

It's cracked -- and you never use

it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending

up a plain, flat silver one -- with

just your initials engraved.

JEFF

Now that's no way to spend your hard-

earned money!

LISA

I wanted to, Jeff.

(A sudden intake of

breath)

Oh!

LISA

What would you think of starting off

with dinner at the "21"?

JEFF

You have, perhaps, an ambulance

outside?

LISA

(Simply)

Better than that. The "21."

LISA

Thank you for waiting Carl.

LISA

Kitchen's on the left. I'll take the

wine.

CARL

Good evening, Mr Jefferies.

JEFF

Hello.

LISA

(Up, to Carl)

Just put everything right in the

oven Carl. On "low."

CARL

(Off)

Yes ma'am.

LISA

(Enthusiastically)

Let's open the wine now. It's a

Montrachet.

JEFF

(Appreciatively)

A big glassful.

LISA

Big enough?

JEFF

Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.

LISA

I couldn't think of anything more

boring and tiresome than what you've

been through. And the last week must

be the hardest.

JEFF

Yeah -- I want to get this thing off

and get moving.

LISA

(Struggling with cork)

Well, I'm going to make this a week

you'll never forget.

CARL

Let me, madam.

LISA

This will take care of the taxi as

well.

CARL

Thank you, Miss Fremont.

CARL

Have a pleasant dinner, Mr. Jefferies.

JEFF

Thank you.

LISA

What a day I've had!

JEFF

Tired?

LISA

Not a bit. I was all morning in a

sales meeting. Then over to the

Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame

Dufresne -- just over from Paris.

With some spy reports. Back to the

"21" for lunch with the Harper's

Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered

dinner. Then two Fall showings --

twenty blocks apart. Then I had to

have a cocktail with Leland and Slim

Hayward -- we're trying to get his

next show.

(Softly, looking up

to him)

Then I had to dash back and change.

JEFF

(Mock seriousness --

one girl to another)

Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward

wearing?

LISA

(Seriously)

She looked very cool. She had on a

mint green --

LISA

And to think, I planted three nice

items about you in the columns today.

LISA

You can't buy that kind of publicity.

JEFF

That's good news.

LISA

Someday you might want to open up

your own studio here.

JEFF

How could I run it from say --

Pakistan?

LISA

Jeff -- isn't it time you came home?

You could pick your assignment.

JEFF

I wish there was one I wanted.

LISA

Make the one you want.

JEFF

(As if he can't believe

her)

You mean leave the magazine?

LISA

Yes.

JEFF

For what?

LISA

For yourself -- and me.

(She adds eagerly)

I could get you a dozen assignments

tomorrow... fashion, portraits --

LISA

(Offended)

Don't laugh. -- I could do it!

JEFF

That's what I'm afraid of.

(He gazes into space)

Could you see me -- driving down to

the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing

combat boots and a three day beard?

(He chuckles at the

thought)

LISA

I could see you looking handsome and

successful in a dark blue flannel

suit.

JEFF

(Looking directly at

her)

Let's not talk any more nonsense,

huh?

LISA

I'd better start setting up for

dinner.

LISA

That's what is know as "manless

melancholia."

JEFF

(Nods agreement)

Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's

something you'll never have to worry

about.

LISA

Oh? You can see my apartment all the

way up on 63rd street?

JEFF

Not exactly -- but we have a little

apartment here that's probably about

as popular as yours.

(He points)

You, of course, remember Miss Torso.

JEFF

Well, she picked the most prosperous

looking one.

LISA

She's not in love with him -- or any

of them.

JEFF

How can you tell that -- from here?

LISA

You said it resembled my apartment,

didn't you?

LISA

(Emerging from kitchen)

Where's that music coming from?

JEFF

Oh... some songwriter. In the studio

apartment. Lives alone. Probably had

an unhappy marriage.

LISA

(Putting down the

food)

I think it's enchanting.

LISA

Almost as if it were being written

especially for us.

JEFF

(Pleasantly)

No wonder he's having so much trouble

with it.

LISA

Well, at least you can't say the

dinner isn't right.

JEFF

Lisa, it's perfect

(Looks down at the

food, without

enthusiasm)

As always.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

LISA

There can't be that much difference

between people and the way they live!

We all eat, talk, drink, laugh, sleep,

wear clothes --

JEFF

Well now, look --

LISA

If you're saying all this just because

you don't want to tell me the truth,

because you're hiding something from

me, then maybe I can understand --

JEFF

There's nothing I'm hiding. It's

just that --

LISA

(Won't let him break

in)

It doesn't make sense to me. What's

so different about it here from over

there, or any place you go, that one

person couldn't live in both places

just as easily?

JEFF

Some people can. Now if you'll let

me explain --

LISA

(Ignores him)

What is it but traveling from one

place to another, taking pictures?

It's just like being a tourist on an

endless vacation.

JEFF

All right. That's your opinion. You're

entitled to it, but --

LISA

It's ridiculous for you to say that

it can only be done by a special,

private little group of anointed

people.

JEFF

I made a simple, but true statement

and I'll back it up, if you'll just

shut up for a minute!

LISA

If your opinion is as rude as your

manner, I'm not sure I want to hear

it.

JEFF

(Soothing her)

Lisa, simmer down -- will you?

LISA

(Something starts her

up again)

You can't fit in here -- I can't fit

in there. According to you, people

should be born, live an die on the

same --

JEFF

(Loud, sharp)

Lisa! Shut up!

JEFF

Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?

LISA

Of course not.

JEFF

You might have to, if you went with

me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54,

at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty

below zero?

LISA

Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever

I have a few minutes after lunch.

JEFF

Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged

at night because people got

unfavorable publicity from your

camera?

JEFF

Those high heels would be a lot of

use in the jungle -- and those nylons

and six-ounce lingerie --

LISA

(Quickly)

Three.

JEFF

Well, they'd be very stylish in

Finland -- just before you froze to

death. Begin to get the idea?

LISA

If there's one thing I know, it's

how to wear the proper clothes.

JEFF

Huh? Try and find a raincoat in

Brazil. Even when it isn't raining

(Squints at her)

Lisa, on this job you carry one

suitcase. Your home is the available

transportation. You sleep rarely,

bathe even less, and sometime the

food you even look at when they were

alive!

LISA

Jeff, you don't have to be

deliberately repulsive just to impress

me I'm wrong.

JEFF

If anything, I'm making it sound

good.

(A thoughtful pause)

Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't

made for that kind of a life. Few

people are.

LISA

You're too stubborn to argue with.

JEFF

I'm not stubborn! I'm truthful!

Lisa, with sarcasm.

LISA

I know. A lesser man would have told

me it was one long holiday -- and I

would have awakened to a rude

disillusionment.

JEFF

Now if you want to get vicious, I'd

be very happy to accommodate you!

LISA

(Wearily)

No. I don't particularly want that.

(She turns, faces him)

So that's it. You won't stay here --

I can't go with you.

JEFF

It would be the wrong thing.

LISA

You don't think either one of us

could ever change?

JEFF

Right now, it doesn't seem so.

LISA

(Simply)

I'm in love with you. I don't care

what you do for a living. Somehow I

would just like to be part of it.

LISA

And it's deflating to find out that

the only way I can be part of it --

is to take out a subscription to

your magazine. I guess I'm not the

girl I thought I was.

JEFF

There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa.

You have the town in the palm of

your hand.

LISA

(Looks at Jeff)

Not quite -- it seems.

(Tosses a stole over

her shoulder)

Goodbye, Jeff.

JEFF

You mean "goodnight."

LISA

I mean what I said.

JEFF

Lisa!

JEFF

Can't we just sort of keep things

status quo?

LISA

Without any future?

JEFF

Well -- when'll I see you again?

LISA

Not for a long time. Not, at least

until --

(She begins smiling)

-- tomorrow night.

GUNNISON

(Filter)

Hello.

JEFF

Gunnison?

GUNNISON

Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?

JEFF

It's me.

GUNNISON

Something wrong?

JEFF

The word is "everything." Now what

time does my plane leave Tuesday?

GUNNISON

(Unhappy)

Jeff --

JEFF

(Won't give him time

to argue)

I don't care where it goes -- just

as long as I'm on it.

GUNNISON

(Wearily, after pause)

Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll

pick you up.

JEFF

That's more like it. Goodnight, old

buddy.

GUNNISON

Yeah.

FADE OUT:

QUICK FADE OUT:

FADE OUT:

FADE OUT:

FADE OUT:

STELLA

You'd think the rain would have cooled

things off. All it did was make the

heat wet.

JEFF

That's a stiff one.

STELLA

The insurance Company would be a lot

happier if you slept in your bed,

not the wheelchair.

JEFF

(Between clenched

teeth)

How did you know!

STELLA

Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring

out the window for hours.

JEFF

I was.

STELLA

(Massaging harder)

What'll you do if one of them catches

you?

JEFF

Depends one which one.

JEFF

Now Miss Torso, for example --

STELLA

Keep your mind off her.

JEFF

She's real eat, drink and be merry

girl.

STELLA

And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and

miserable.

JEFF

Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts

drank herself to sleep again. Alone.

STELLA

Poor girl. Someday she'll find her

happiness.

JEFF

And some man will lose his.

STELLA

Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood

who might cast an eye in her

direction?

JEFF

Well, the salesman could be available

soon.

STELLA

(Interested in the

scandal)

He and his wife splitting up?

JEFF

It's hard to figure. He went out

several time last night, in the rain

carrying his sample case.

STELLA

(So?)

Isn't he a salesman?

JEFF

Now what could he sell at three in

the morning?

STELLA

(Shrugs)

Flashlights. Luminous dials for

watches. House numbers that light

up.

JEFF

He was taking something out of the

apartment. I'm certain.

STELLA

His personal effects. He's probably

running away -- the coward.

JEFF

Sometimes it's worse to stay than it

is to run.

STELLA

(Looks at him)

But it takes a particularly low type

of man to do it.

STELLA

(Putting oil and power

away)

What about this morning? Any

developments?

JEFF

No. The shades are still drawn in

their apartment.

STELLA

(stops)

In this heat?

(Turns, looks over

his shoulder)

They're up now.

JEFF

Get back! Out of sight! Quick!

STELLA

(A startled whisper)

What is it? What's the matter?

JEFF

(Quietly)

The salesman's looking out his window.

STELLA

A Federal offense.

JEFF

(Sharply)

Get back there! He'll see you!

STELLA

I'm not shy. I've been looked at

before.

JEFF

(Still peering toward

window)

It's not an ordinary look. It's the

kind of look a man gives when he's

afraid somebody might be watching

him.

STELLA

Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you

tomorrow.

JEFF

(Grunts)

Uh-huh.

STELLA

And don't sleep in the chair again.

JEFF

Uh-huh.

STELLA

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Great

conversationalist.

JEFF

Stella.

JEFF

(Goes on quickly)

Will you take those binoculars out

of the case and bring them to me.

STELLA

Trouble. I cam smell it. I'll be

glad when they crack that cast, and

I get out of here.

FADE OUT:

LISA

How far does a girl have to go --

before you notice her?

JEFF

If she's pretty enough, she doesn't

have to go anywhere. She just has to

"be".

LISA

Well, "ain't I?" -- Pay attention to

me.

JEFF

I'm not exactly on the other side of

the room.

LISA

Your mind is. And when I want a man,

I want all of him.

JEFF

Don't you ever have any problems?

LISA

(Murmurs, kissing him)

I have one now.

JEFF

So do I.

LISA

(Kissing)

Tell me about it.

JEFF

(Slight pause)

Why would a man leave his apartment

three times, on a rainy night, with

a suitcase? And come back three times?

LISA

He likes the way his wife welcomes

him home.

JEFF

Not that salesman's wife. And why

didn't he go to work today?

LISA

Homework. It's more interesting.

JEFF

What's interesting about a butcher's

knife and a small saw wrapped up in

a newspaper?

LISA

Nothing, thank heaven.

JEFF

(Looking again)

Why hasn't he gone into his wife's

bedroom all day?

LISA

I wouldn't dare answer that.

JEFF

(After pause)

Lisa -- there's something terribly

wrong.

LISA

And I'm afraid it's with me.

JEFF

(Looks at Lisa)

What do you think?

LISA

(Without returning

his look)

Something too frightful to utter.

JEFF

He went out a few minutes ago -- in

his undershirt -- and he hasn't come

back yet.

JEFF

You know -- that would be terrible

job to tackle.

JEFF

How would you begin to cut up a human

body?

LISA

Jeff -- I'll be honest with you --

you're beginning to scare me a little.

LISA

(Quietly insistent)

Jeff -- did you hear what I said?

You're beginning to --

JEFF

(Interrupting)

Be quiet! Shhh!

(Pause)

He's coming back!

LISA

(sharply)

Jeff -- if you could only see

yourself.

JEFF

Now, Lisa --

LISA

(Abruptly)

Sitting around, looking out a window

to kill time, is one thing -- but

doing it the way you are --

(She gestures)

-- with, with binoculars, and with

wild opinions about every little

movement you see -- is, is diseased!

JEFF

Do you think I consider this

recreation?

LISA

I don't know what you consider it --

but if you don't stop it, I'm getting

out of here.

JEFF

You'd better before you catch the

disease!

LISA

(Insistent)

What is it you're looking for?

JEFF

I want to find out what's wrong with

the salesman's wife. Does that make

me sound like a madman?

LISA

What makes you think something's

wrong with her?

LISA

A lot of things. She's an invalid

who needs constant care -- and yet

the husband nor anyone else has been

in there all day.

LISA

Maybe she died.

JEFF

Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?

LISA

She could be under sedatives,

sleeping.

(Looks up)

He's in the room now.

JEFF

Lisa, please!

LISA

There's nothing to see.

JEFF

There is -- I've seen things through

that window! Bickering, family fights,

mysterious trips at night, knives,

saws, rope -- and since last evening,

not a sight or sound of his wife!

Now you tell me where she is and

what she's doing!

LISA

Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't

know, and I don't care. Lots of people

have saws, knives and ropes around

their houses. Lots of men don't speak

to their wives all day. Lots of wives

nag, and men hate them, and trouble

starts -- but very, very, very few

of them end up in murder -- if that's

what you're thinking.

JEFF

It's pretty hard to stay away from

that word isn't is?

LISA

You could see all the things he did,

couldn't you?

JEFF

What are you getting at?

LISA

You could see that he did because he

had the shades in his apartment up,

and walked along the corridor, and

the streets and the backyard?

JEFF

Yeah.

LISA

Jeff, do you think a murderer would

let you see all that? That he

shouldn't keep his shades down and

hide behind them?

JEFF

That's where he's being clever. Acting

nonchalant.

LISA

And that's where you're not being

clever. He wouldn't parade his crime

in front of the open shades.

LISA

(Pointing)

For all you know -- there's something

a lot more sinister going on behind

those shades.

JEFF

No comment.

LISA

Don't you see how silly you're being?

JEFF

Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right.

He's probably in the bedroom now,

entertaining his wife with the indian

rope trick. I'll admit to criminal

insanity. Now when do I start the

cure?

LISA

Let's start from the beginning again,

Jeff. Tell me everything you saw --

and what you think it means.

FADES OUT:

JEFF

Yeah?

LISA

The name on the second floor rear

mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars,

that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.

JEFF

(Filter)

What's the apartment house number?

LISA

125 West Ninth Street.

JEFF

Thanks, Lisa.

LISA

Okay, chief. What's my next

assignment.

JEFF

To get on home.

LISA

All right -- but what's he doing

now?

JEFF

Just sitting in the living room. In

the dark. And he hasn't gone near

the bedroom. Now get some sleep.

Goodnight.

FADE OUT:

JEFF

Look, Doyle -- it's just one of those

things I can't tell you on the phone.

You have to be here, and see the

whole set-up.

JEFF

It's probably nothing important --

just a little neighborhood murder,

that's all. As a matter of fact, I

did say "murder".

JEFF

My only thought was to throw a little

business your way. A good detective,

I reasoned, would jump at the chance

to detect.

JEFF

Well, I usually took my best pictures

on my day off.

(nods)

Okay, Doyle -- soon as you can.

JEFF

Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a

welcome sight this is. No wonder

your husband's still in love with

you.

STELLA

Police?

JEFF

(Pauses in cutting

food)

Huh?

STELLA

You called the police?

JEFF

Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an

official call. He's just a friend.

(Almost to himself)

An old, ornery friend.

STELLA

(Half to herself)

Now just where do you suppose he cut

her up?

STELLA

(Answering herself)

Oh -- of course! In the bathtub.

That's the only place he could wash

away the blood.

STELLA'S VOICE

He'd better get that trunk out of

there before is starts to leak.

GIRL'S VOICE

H-a-a-r-r-e-e...

STELLA'S VOICE

Look! Look -- Mr. Jefferies!

JEFF

(Agitated)

I thought Doyle would get here before

the trunk went -- or I'd have called

the police.

(To Stella)

Now we're going to lose it.

JEFF

Stella, don't do anything reckless!

STELLA

I'm just going to get the name of

their truck!

JEFF

(Up)

I'll watch the alleyway -- in case

it goes that way.

JEFF

Long Distance.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

DOYLE

You didn't see the killing, or the

body? How do you know there was a

murder?

JEFF

Because everything that man's done

has been suspicious. Trips at night

in the rain, saws, knives, trunks

with rope, and a wife that isn't

there any more.

DOYLE

I'll admit it all has a mysterious

sound -- but is could mean a number

of different things. Murder is the

least likely.

JEFF

Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an

unemployed magician -- amusing the

neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.

DOYLE

It's too stupid and obvious a way to

murder -- in full view of fifty

windows -- and then sit over there --

(He points)

-- smoking a cigar -- waiting for

the police to pick him up.

JEFF

Well, officer -- do your duty.

DOYLE

You've got a lot to lean about

homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed

murder so shrewdly that it took a

hundred trained police minds to catch

them. That salesman wouldn't just

knock off his wife after dinner,

toss her in a trunk and put her in

storage.

JEFF

I'll bet it's been done.

DOYLE

Almost everything's been done --

under panic. But this is a thousand

to one shot. That man's still sitting

around his apartment; he isn't

panicked.

JEFF

(A pause)

You think I made all this up?

DOYLE

I think you saw something -- that

probably has a very simple

explanation.

JEFF

For instance?

DOYLE

(Shrugs)

His wife took a trip.

JEFF

She -- was -- an -- invalid!

DOYLE

You told me.

(Looks at watch)

I've got to run, Jeff.

JEFF

All right -- you don't believe me.

DOYLE

I -- uh -- won't report it to the

Department. Let me poke into a little

on my own. No point in you getting

any ridiculous publicity.

JEFF

(Coldly)

Thanks.

DOYLE

We know the wife is gone. I'll see

if I can find out where.

JEFF

Do that.

DOYLE

You have any headaches lately?

JEFF

Not 'til you showed up.

DOYLE

Uh-huh. Well, it'll wear off in time --

along with the hallucinations. See

you around.

DOYLE

By the way  what happened to your

leg?

JEFF

I was jaywalking.

DOYLE'S VOICE (O.S.)

Where?

JEFF

(With nonchalance)

The Indianapolis Speedway.

DOYLE

During the race?

JEFF

Yup. It sure stopped traffic.

LAP DISSOLVES TO:

DOYLE

He has a six months lease, and has

used up a little over five and a

half months of it.

(Takes a sip of drink)

Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness.

Pays his bill promptly, with money

earned as a consume jewelry salesman --

wholesale. Keeps to himself, and

none of the neighbors got close to

him, or his wife.

JEFF

I think they missed their chance

with her.

DOYLE

(Studies drink)

She never left the apartment --

JEFF

(Interrupting)

Then where is she -- in the ice box?

DOYLE

(Continues)

-- until yesterday morning.

JEFF

(Alert)

What time?

DOYLE

Six ayem.

JEFF

I think that's about the time I fell

asleep.

DOYLE

Too bad. The Thorwalds were just

leaving the apartment house at that

time.

DOYLE

Feel a little foolish?

JEFF

Not yet.

JEFF

How's your wife?

DOYLE

Oh -- oh, she's fine.

(Not too convincing)

Just fine.

JEFF

Who said they left then?

DOYLE

Who left -- where?

JEFF

The Thorwalds -- at six in the

morning?

DOYLE

The building superintendent, and two

tenants. Flat statements -- no

hesitation. And they all jibed to

the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving

for the railroad station.

JEFF

Now how could anybody guess that?

They had, perhaps, signs on their

luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?

DOYLE

(Sighs)

The superintendent met Thorwald coming

back. He said Thorwald told him he

had just put his wife on the train

for the country.

JEFF

A very convenient guy -- this

superintendent. Have you checked his

bank deposits lately?

DOYLE

Jeff -- huh?

JEFF

(Sharply)

Well -- what good is his

information?!! It's a second-hand

version of an unsupported statement

by the murderer himself -- Thorwald!

Anybody actually see the wife get on

the train?

DOYLE

I hate to remind you -- but this all

started because you said she was

murdered. Now did anyone, including

you, actually see her murdered?

JEFF

Doyle -- are you interested in solving

a case, or making me look foolish?

DOYLE

If possible -- both.

JEFF

Well then do a good job of it! Get

over there, and search Thorwald's

apartment! It must be knee-deep in

evidence.

DOYLE

I can't do that.

JEFF

I mean when he goes out for a paper,

or a drink, or something. What he

doesn't know won't hurt him.

DOYLE

I can't do it even if he's gone.

JEFF

(With sarcasm)

What's the matter? Does he have a

courtesy card from the police

department?

DOYLE

Now don't get me mad! Even a detective

can't walk in anybody's apartment

and search it. If I were ever caught

in there, I'd lose my badge inside

of ten minutes!

JEFF

Just make sure you're not caught. If

you find something, you've got a

murderer and nobody will care about

a couple of house rules. If you find

nothing -- he's clear.

DOYLE

At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff --

I'll remind you of the Constitution,

and the phrase "search warrant" issued

by a judge who knows the Bill of

Rights verbatim. He must ask for

evidence.

JEFF

Give him evidence.

DOYLE

I can hear myself starting out. "Your

Honor -- I have a friend who's an

amateur sleuth, an one night, after

a heavy supper --"

(He shakes his head

"no")

He'd throw the New York State Penal

Code right in my face. -- And it's

six volumes.

JEFF

By morning there might not be anything

left to find in his apartment.

DOYLE

(Looking out window)

A detective's nightmare.

JEFF

What do you need before you can search --

bloody footsteps leading up to the

door?

DOYLE

(Looking out window)

One thing I don't need is heckling!

You called and asked me for help --

and now you're acting like a taxpayer!

DOYLE

(Turns and look at

Jeff)

How did we ever stand each other in

that same plane for three years?

JEFF

You know, every day for three years

I asked myself that same question?

DOYLE

Ever get an answer?

JEFF

Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something

like this: "Your request for transfer

turned down --"

DOYLE

Sorry I had to turn it down.

(He checks his watch)

I'm going over to the railroad station

and check Thorwald's story.

JEFF

Forget the story -- find the trunk.

Mrs. Thorwald's in it!

DOYLE

Oh -- I almost forgot!

DOYLE

(Looking at Jeff)

There was a postcard in Thorwald's

mailbox.

(Refers to paper)

Mailed yesterday afternoon, three-

thirty P.M. from Merritsville --

(Looks up, speaks

pleasantly)

-- That's eighty miles north of here.

(Back to paper)

The message read "Arrived O.K. Already

feeling better. Love, Anna."

JEFF

(Slowly)

Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?

DOYLE

(Nods "yes")

Mrs. Thorwald.

DOYLE

(Maliciously)

Anything you need?

JEFF

Yeah. A good detective.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. DOYLE

(Filter)

Hello.

JEFF

Mrs. Doyle?

MRS. DOYLE

Yes.

JEFF

Jeff again.

(A note of urgency)

Has Tom come in yet?

MRS. DOYLE

Not yet, Jeff.

JEFF

You haven't even heard from him?

MRS. DOYLE

Not a word.

MRS. DOYLE

It is something really important,

Jeff?

JEFF

I'm afraid it is, Tess.

MRS. DOYLE

I'll have him call the moment I hear

from him.

JEFF

Tell him not to waste time calling.

To get over here soon as he can. I

think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.

MRS. DOYLE

Who's Thorwald?

JEFF

He knows.

(As an after-thought)

Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.

MRS. DOYLE

(She laughs)

Goodnight, you idiot.

JEFF

(A slight smile)

Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.

JEFF

Long distance again.

JEFF

Quick. Take a look. Thorwald's getting

ready to pull out for good!

LISA

It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.

JEFF

(Stares out the window,

exasperated)

He was just laying all his things

out on one of the beds! Coats, suits,

shirts, sox, even his wife's --

JEFF

That alligator bag his wife had on

the bedpost --

LISA

What about it?

JEFF

He had it hidden in the dresser!

Well, at least it was in there. He

took it out, went to the phone and

called somebody long distance. --

His wife's jewelry was in the handbag.

And something about it worried him.

He was asking somebody advice over

the phone.

LISA

Someone not his wife?

JEFF

I never saw him ask her for advise

before.

(Smiles)

But she volunteered plenty.

LISA

I wonder where he's going now?

JEFF

I don't know.

LISA

Suppose he doesn't come back again?

JEFF

He will. All his things are still

piled on the bed.

LISA

Well, I guess it's safe to put on

some lights now.

JEFF

(Looking to left)

Not yet!

JEFF

He must have gone somewhere to the

right.

LISA

All day long I've tried to keep my

mind on work.

JEFF

Thinking about Thorwald?

LISA

(Nods yes)

And you, and you friend Doyle --

(Stops, to Jeff)

Did you hear from him again -- since

he left?

JEFF

Not a word. He was going to check on

the railroad station, and the trunk.

He must be still on it.

JEFF

Something on your mind, Lisa?

LISA

It doesn't make sense to me.

JEFF

What doesn't?

LISA

Women aren't that unpredictable.

JEFF

(Losing a little

patience)

Lisa -- I can't guess what you're

thinking.

LISA

A woman has a favorite handbag -- it

always hangs on her bedpost where

she can get at it. Then she takes a

trip and leaves it behind. Why?

JEFF

Because she didn't know she was going

on a trip -- and where she was going

she wouldn't need a handbag.

LISA

But only her husband would know that.

(Starts to pace again)

And the jewelry! Women don't keep

all their jewelry in a purse, all

tangled, getting scratched and twisted

up.

JEFF

Do they hide it in their husband's

clothes?

LISA

They do not! And they don't leave it

behind them. A woman going anywhere

but the hospital would always take

makeup, perfume and jewelry.

JEFF

Inside stuff?

LISA

Basic equipment. You don't leave it

behind in your husband's drawer in

your favorite handbag.

JEFF

I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective

Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for

that.

LISA

That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem

yesterday with her husband?

JEFF

That's what the witnesses told him.

LISA

Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr.

Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs.

Thorwald -- or I don't know women.

JEFF

Still -- those witnesses.

LISA

We'll agree they saw a woman -- but

she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That

is, yet.

JEFF

Come here.

LISA

I'd like to see your friend's face

when we tell him. He doesn't sound

like much of a detective.

JEFF

Don't be too hard on him. He's a

steady worker. I wish he'd get there,

though.

LISA

(Nuzzling Jeff)

Don't rush me. We have all night.

JEFF

We have all -- what?

LISA

Night. I'm going to stay with you.

JEFF

You'll have to clear that through my

landlord --

LISA

I have the whole weekend off.

JEFF

Well that's fine, but I only have

one bed, and --

LISA

Say anything else, and I'll stay

tomorrow night too.

JEFF

Lisa, I won't be able to give you

any --

JEFF

-- pajamas.

LISA

You said I'd have to live out of one

suitcase

(Picks up case)

I'll bet yours isn't this small?

JEFF

That's a suitcase?

LISA

(Starting to open it)

A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway.

Compact, but ample enough.

LISA

I'll trade you -- my feminine

intuition for a bed for the night.

JEFF

(Gives in smiling)

I'd be no better than Thorwald, to

refuse.

LISA

There's that song again.

LISA

Where does a man get the inspiration

for a song like that?

JEFF

From his landlord -- once a month.

LISA

It's utterly beautiful.

(Turns to Jeff)

I wish I could be creative.

JEFF

You are. You have a talent for

creating difficult situations.

LISA

(Happily)

I do?

JEFF

Staying the night here, uninvited.

LISA

Surprise -- is the most important

element of attack.

(She smiles)

And beside, you're not up on your

private eye literature. When they're

in trouble, it's always their Girl

Friday who gets them out of it.

JEFF

The same girl who keeps him out of

the clutches of seductive show girls,

and over-passionate daughters of the

rich.

LISA

The same.

JEFF

But he never ends up marrying her.

Strange.

LISA

(Stands up; deadpan)

Weird.

(She does a complete

spin, then,

ingenuously)

Why don't I slip into something

comfortable?

JEFF

You mean -- like the kitchen? And

make us some coffee?

LISA

Exactly what I had in mind -- along

with some brandy.

GIRL'S VOICE

H-a-a-r-r-e-e-!

DOYLE

What else do you have on this man

Thorwald?

JEFF

Enough to scare me that you wouldn't

get here in time, and we'd lose him.

DOYLE

(Soberly)

You think he's getting out of here?

JEFF

Everything he owns is laid out on

the bedroom, ready for packing.

LISA

I'm just warming some brandy.

LISA

Mr. Doyle? -- I presume.

JEFF

Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.

DOYLE

How do you do?

LISA

We think Thorwald's guilty.

JEFF

(Cautiously)

Careful, Tom.

JEFF

Hallo?

JEFF

Just a minute, please.

DOYLE

Doyle speaking.

(He listens)

Uh-huh. -- Yeah. Mummmm -- Mmm. Hmm --

Okay. Thank you, and goodbye.

LISA

The coffee will be ready soon.

(Urgent)

Jeff, aren't you going to tell him

about the jewelry?

DOYLE

Jewelry?

JEFF

He has his wife's jewelry hidden in

among his clothes over there.

DOYLE

You sure it belongs to his wife?

LISA

It was in her favorite handbag --

And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to

only one conclusion.

DOYLE

Namely?

JEFF

That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left

with him yesterday morning?

DOYLE

You figured that out, huh?

LISA

It's just that women don't leave

jewelry behind when they go on a

trip.

JEFF

Come on, Tom -- you don't really

need any of this information, do

you?

DOYLE

As a matter of fact, I don't.

DOYLE

Lars Thorwald is no more a murderer

than I am.

JEFF

You mean you can explain everything

that went on over there -- and is

still going on?

DOYLE

No!

DOYLE

And neither can you.

(Points out window)

That's a secret and private world

you're looking into out there. People

do a lot at things in private that

they couldn't explain in public.

LISA

Like disposing of their wives?

DOYLE

(Off)

Get that idea out of your mind. It

will only lead you in the wrong

direction.

JEFF

But Tom -- the saw, the knives --

DOYLE

Did you ever own a saw?

JEFF

(Off)

Well, in the garage, back home, we --

DOYLE

(Interrupts)

And how many people did you cut up

with the couple of with it? Or hundred

knives you've probably owned in your

lifetime?

JEFF

But I'm not a killer!

DOYLE

(Off)

Your logic is backward.

LISA

You can't ignore the wife

disappearing! And the trunk -- and

the jewelry -- !

DOYLE

I checked the railroad station. He

bought a ticket. He put her on the

train ten minutes later. Destination:

Merritsville. Witnesses. This deep.

(He holds his hand a

few feet off the

floor)

LISA

It might have been a woman -- but it

couldn't have been Mrs. Thorwald.

That jewelry --

DOYLE

Look, Miss Fremont. That feminine

intuition sells magazines -- but in

real life, it's still a fairy tale.

I don't know how many wasted years

I've spent running down leads based

on women's intuitions.

JEFF

I take it you didn't find the trunk --

And this is just an old speech you

once gave at the Policeman's Ball.

DOYLE

I found the trunk -- a half hour

after I left here.

LISA

Of course, it's normal for a man to

tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.

DOYLE

(Off)

When the lock is broken -- yes.

JEFF

What was in the trunk? A surly note

to me?

DOYLE

(Carefully)

Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. --

Clean -- carefully packed -- not too

stylish -- but presentable.

LISA

(Off)

Didn't you take it to the crime lab?

DOYLE

I sent it on its merry and legal

way.

JEFF

Why -- when a woman only goes on a

simple trip, does she take everything

she owns?

DOYLE

Let the female psychology department

handle that one.

LISA

I would say that is looked as if she

wasn't coming back.

DOYLE

(Off)

That's what they call a family

problem.

JEFF

(Persisting)

If his wife wasn't coming back --

why didn't he tell his landlord? --

I'll answer it for you -- because he

had something to hide.

DOYLE

(Blandly)

Do -- uh -- you tell your landlord

everything?

JEFF

I told you to be careful.

DOYLE

If I'd been careful piloting that

reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't

have taken the kind of pictures that

got you a medal, a big job, fame,

money --

JEFF

(Expressionless)

All the things I hate.

DOYLE

Now -- what do you say we sit down

to a quiet, friendly drink or two --

forget all about this, and tell lies

about the old days in the war? Hmmm?

He looks from one to the other.

LISA

You're through with the case?

DOYLE

There isn't any "case" to be through

with, Miss Fremont. Now let's get

down to that friendly drink.

DOYLE

Maybe you're right. I guess I'd better

get home and get some sleep.

DOYLE

I'm not much of a snifter.

DOYLE

If you need any more help, Jeff --

consult the yellow pages of your

telephone directory.

LISA

I hate funny exit lines.

JEFF

Who was the trunk addressed to?

DOYLE

Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

JEFF

Let's wait and see who picks it up.

DOYLE

Oh -- that phone call!

(To Jeff)

I gave them your number -- hope you

don't mind.

JEFF

(Off)

That depends on who "they" were.

DOYLE

(Pleasantly)

The police Department at Merritsville.

They called to report. The trunk was

just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna

Thorwald.

DOYLE

Don't stay up too late.

LISA

Look.

JEFF

As much as I hate to give Thomas J.

Doyle too much credit, he might have

gotten a hold of something when he

said this was pretty private stuff

going on out there.

JEFF

Do you suppose it's ethical to watch

a man with binoculars, and a long-

focus lens -- until you can see the

freckles on the back of his neck,

and almost read his mail -- do you

suppose it's ethical even if you

prove he didn't commit a crime?

LISA

I'm not much on rear window ethics.

JEFF

Of course, they have the same chance.

They can look at me like a bug under

glass, if they want to.

LISA

(Turns to him)

Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I

don't think they'd believe what they

see.

JEFF

Huh?

LISA

You and me with long faces -- plunged

into despair -- because we find out

that a man didn't kill his wife.

We're two of the most frightening

ghouls I've ever known.

LISA

You'd think we could be a little bit

happy that the poor woman is alive

and well.

LISA

Whatever happened to that old saying

"Love Thy Neighbor."

JEFF

I think I'll start reviving it

tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for

a start?

LISA

(As she get up)

Not if I have to move into an

apartment across the courtyard and

do the dance of the seven veils once

an hour.

(As she lowers the

blinds)

Show's over for tonight.

LISA

Preview -- of the coming attractions.

LISA

Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this

case.

JEFF

(Mock seriousness)

No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

LISA

(Softly)

What do you think?

LISA

I'll rephrase the question.

JEFF

Thank you.

LISA

Do you like it?

JEFF

(Studying it)

Well, -- if there was one less thread

this way --

(motions horizontally)

-- and two less that way --

(Motions vertically)

-- I might give up bachelorhood.

LISA

I'll be right back.

LONELY HEARTS

(Her voice clear)

It's dead! It's been strangled and

the neck is broken!

SIFFLEUSE

Which one of you did it?

(Loud)

Which one of you killed my dog?

(No one answers; her

voice is acid)

You don't know the meaning of the

word "neighbor". Neighbors like each

other -- speak to each other -- care

if anybody lives or dies. But none

of you do! You don't talk, you don't

help, you -- you don't ---

(Fighting tears)

Even see. But I couldn't imagine any

Even of you being so low that you'd

kill a little helpless, friendly

dog! The only thing in this whole

neighborhood who liked anybody!

SIFFLEUSE

Did you kill him because he liked

you? Just because he liked you?

JEFF

For a minute, Doyle almost had me

convinced I was wrong.

LISA

But you're not?

JEFF

In the whole courtyard, only one

person didn't come to the window.

(He points)

LISA

Why would Thorwald want to kill a

dog?

(Almost a laugh)

Because it knew too much?

JEFF

Do you think this was worth waiting

all day to see?

LISA

Is he cleaning house?

JEFF

He's washing down the bathroom walls.

STELLA

Must have splattered a lot.

STELLA

Well, why not? That's what we're all

thinking. He killed her in there,

and he has to wipe up the stains

before he leaves.

LISA

Stella, your choice of words --

STELLA

Nobody's invented polite words yet

for killing.

JEFF

Lisa -- Lisa -- on the shelf over

there -- get me the small yellow box --

JEFF

And that little viewer.

JEFF

(Half to himself as

he searches slides)

These aren't more than two weeks old --

I hope I didn't take all leg art.

(Discovers the right

slide)

I think this is the one.

LISA

Jeff -- what are you looking for?

JEFF

Something -- that if I'm right --

might solve a murder.

STELLA

Mrs. Thorwald?

JEFF

Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now

why Thorwald killed it.

JEFF

You take a look and tell me what you

see.

JEFF

(Over)

Now take it away.

JEFF

Well?

LISA

It's just a picture of the backyard,

that's all.

JEFF

I know. But there's one important

change. The flowers in Thorwald's

pet flower bed.

STELLA

You mean the one the dog was sniffing

around?

JEFF

(To Stella)

And digging in.

(Points out window)

Look at that flower bed.

JEFF

There's a dip at this end. And since

when do flowers grow shorter in two

weeks?

STELLA

There's something buried there.

LISA

(Breathing it)

Mrs. Thorwald!

STELLA

You haven't spent much time in

cemeteries, have you?

(they don't answer)

Mr. Thorwald could hardly put his

wife into a plot of ground scarcely

one foot square.

STELLA

Unless, he puts in standing on end --

which would be very original and not

require the use of either a knife or

a saw. My guess is she's scattered

all over town. A leg in the East

River -- an arm --

LISA

(Cuts in)

Stella, please.

JEFF

Something's in there. Those flowers

have been taken up, and put back

again.

LISA

(Has a hard time saying

it)

It could be -- the knife, and the

saw.

STELLA

(Quickly)

Call Lieutenant Doyle!

LISA

No -- let's wait. Let's wait until

it gets dark. I'll go over and dig

it up!

JEFF

(To Stella)

I'm not going to call Doyle until I

show him the body of Mrs. Thorwald --

(To Lisa)

And you're not going to dig up

anything, an get your neck broken

too.

JEFF

What we've got to do is find some

way to get in there, and --

STELLA

He's starting to pack.

FADE OUT:

STELLA

What are you going back for?

JEFF

You did it, Thorwald! You did it!

JEFF

Lisa! Look out! He's coming!

STELLA

(Accusingly)

You shouldn't have let her do that!

If he ever --

JEFF

(Interrupting)

Look!

STELLA

Thank heaven that's over!

JEFF

I have a feeling we've just begun.

JEFF

No doubt of it. He's leaving. The

question is -- when?

STELLA

Mind if I use the portable keyhole?

JEFF

Not as long as you tell me what you're

looking at.

STELLA

I wonder.

JEFF

What?

STELLA

Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out

something that looks like sodium

trieckonal capsules.

JEFF

You can tell that from here?

STELLA

I handled enough of those red pills

to put everybody in New Jersey asleep

for the winter.

JEFF

Would four of them -- ?

STELLA

(Breaks in)

No -- but it makes the rest easy to

take. And she's reading the Bible.

JEFF

(After a slight pause)

Then I wouldn't worry too much. But

let's keep an eye on her.

STELLA

You know? You might not be too bad a

bargain for Lisa after all.

JEFF

You don't say! I might just take

that compliment as an insult.

LISA

Wasn't that close?

JEFF

(Off)

Too close.

LISA

What was his reaction? I mean when

he looked at the note?

STELLA

Well, it wasn't the kind of expression

that would get him a quick loan at

the bank.

LISA

Jeff -- how did I do?

JEFF

Real professional. Would have made a

great layout for the Bazaar. The

model pressed back against a brick

wall, eyes wild, tense. Low cut

bodice, in new suspicious black,

with a --

STELLA

(Interrupts Jeff)

You'd make a good door prize at a

wake.

LISA

Jeff -- the handbag.

JEFF

Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring

was among the jewelry he has in the

handbag.

(Supporting his

proposition)

During that phone conversation he

held up three rings -- one with a

diamond -- one with a big stone of

some kind -- and one plain gold band.

LISA

(Excited)

And the last thing she'd leave behind

would be her wedding ring!

(To Stella)

Do you ever leave yours at home?

STELLA

The only way anybody could get that

off would be to chop my finger --

Let's go down and find out what's

buried in the garden.

LISA

Why not? I always wanted to meet

Mrs. Thorwald.

JEFF

What are you two talking about?

STELLA

Got a shovel?

JEFF

No.

STELLA

There's probably one in the basement.

JEFF

Now wait a minute --

LISA

Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't

look.

JEFF

Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish

about what might be under those

flowers -- but I don't care to watch

two women end up like that dog --

STELLA

(To Lisa)

You know, Miss Fremont -- he might

just have something there.

JEFF

There's no point in taking unnecessary

chances.

(He points)

Give me the phone book, Lisa.

LISA

What for?

JEFF

Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the

apartment.

STELLA

We only need a few minutes.

JEFF

I'll try to give you at least fifteen

minutes.

LISA

How?

JEFF

(Finds the number)

Chelsea 2-7099.

(He looks up, reaches

for the phone)

We scared him once. Maybe we can

scare him again.

(Picks up receiver;

pauses)

I'm using that word "we" a little

too freely, I guess. I don't take

any of the chances.

LISA

Shall we vote him in, Stella?

STELLA

Unanimously.

JEFF

(Off, half-aloud)

Go ahead, Thorwald -- pick it up.

You're curious. You wonder if it's

your girl friend calling. The one

you killed for. Pick it up, Thorwald!

THORWALD

(Cautiously, on filter)

Hello.

JEFF

(Off)

Did you get my note?

JEFF

Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?

THORWALD

Who are you?

JEFF

I'll give you a chance to find out.

Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort --

and do it right away.

THORWALD

Why should I?

JEFF

For a little business meeting -- to

settle the estate of your late wife.

THORWALD

(After a pause)

I don't know what you mean.

JEFF

(Firmly)

Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or

I'll hang up and call the police.

THORWALD

(Breathing heavily)

I only have a hundred dollars or so.

JEFF

That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort

now. I'll be looking for you.

LISA

(Over)

Let's go, Stella.

JEFF

One of you watch this window. If I

see him coming back, I'll signal

with a flashbulb.

BABY SITTER

This is Doyle's house.

JEFF

This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of

Tom's. Who am I talking with?

BABY SITTER

This is the baby sitter.

JEFF

Oh. When are they expected home?

BABY SITTER

I'm hired 'til one. They went to

dinner and maybe night-clubbing.

JEFF

Well, if he calls in, tell him to

get in touch with L. B. Jefferies

right away. I might have quite a

surprise for him.

BABY SITTER

Does he have your number, Mr.

Jefferies?

JEFF

He has it. Thank you.

BABY SITTER

Goodnight.

JEFF

Lisa -- no!

JEFF

Come on. Come on! Get out of there!

STELLA

Ring Thorwald's phone the second you

see him on the way back!

JEFF

I'm going to ring him now!

STELLA

Give her another minute -- She's

doing this for you.

STELLA

Miss Lonely Hearts!

STELLA

(Off)

Call the police!

STELLA

Maybe that music will delay her taking

the pills.

JEFF

Lisa! Lisa!

POLICE

Precinct Six -- Sergeant Allgood.

POLICE

Precinct Six -- Sergeant Allgood.

JEFF

A man is assaulting a woman at one

two five west ninth street. Second

floor rear. Make it fast.

POLICE

Your name?

JEFF

L. B. Jefferies.

POLICE

Phone number?

JEFF

(Impatiently)

Chelsea 2-5598.

POLICE

Two minutes.

JEFF

(With deep sincerity)

Stella -- what can we do?

STELLA

There they are.

STELLA

What's she trying to do? Why doesn't

she turn him in?

JEFF

Smart girl.

STELLA

Smart? She'll be arrested!

JEFF

That'll get her out of there, won't

it?

STELLA

Mrs. Thorwald's ring!

JEFF

Stella! The lights! He'd seen us!

STELLA

When you took your first snapshot --

did you ever think it would bring

you to this?

JEFF

(Urgently)

Stella -- how long do you think he'll

stay there?

STELLA

(Squinting out window)

Unless he's dumber than I think, he

won't wait 'til his lease is up.

JEFF

My billfold! In the right hand drawer.

STELLA

What do you need money for?

JEFF

To bail Lisa out of jail.

STELLA

You know -- you could just leave her

there until after next Tuesday -- so

you could sneak away safely -- as

planned.

JEFF

(With obvious

disappointment)

One hundred and twenty-seven.

STELLA

How much do you think you'll need?

JEFF

First offense burglary --

(He shrugs)

-- probably two-fifty.

(Gets an idea, points)

The piggy bank.

STELLA

Ten here.

JEFF

Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety.

Not enough.

STELLA

I got twenty or so in my purse. Give

me what you've got.

JEFF

What about the rest?

STELLA

When those cops get a look at Miss

Fremont -- they'll even contribute.

JEFF

(To phone)

Just a minute.

(To Stella)

I'll tell you who it is when you get

back.

JEFF

Jefferies.

DOYLE

(Filter)

This is Doyle, Jeff.

JEFF

(Urgently)

Tom, I've got something real big for

you.

DOYLE

(Wearily)

Look Jeff, don't louse up my night

with another man killer stuffing a

grisly trunk that turns out to be --

JEFF

(Interrupting harshly)

Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.

DOYLE

(Slightest pause)

Your Lisa?

JEFF

My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's

apartment, and he came back. The

only way I could get her out was to

call the police.

DOYLE

(Angry)

I told you that --

JEFF

(Interrupting)

I know what you told me! She went in

to get evidence, and she came out

with it.

DOYLE

Like what?

JEFF

Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring.

If that woman were still alive, she'd

be wearing it.

DOYLE

(Grudgingly)

A possibility.

JEFF

(Talking fast)

A fact! Last night he killed a dog

for pawing in his garden. Why? Because

he had something buried in there.

Something a dog could scent.

DOYLE

Like an old hambone?

JEFF

(Fast)

I don't know what pet name Thorwald

had for his wife. And that night he

went out half a dozen times with the

metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his

possessions, because they're up in

his apartment now!

DOYLE

You think perhaps it was "old

hambone?"

JEFF

In sections! And one other thing,

doubting Tom -- it just occurred to

me that all the calls Thorwald made

were long distance! If he called his

wife the day she left -- after she

arrived in Merritsville -- why did

she need to send him a postcard saying

she'd arrived?

DOYLE

(After pause; a

detective)

Where'd they take Lisa?

JEFF

Precinct Six. I sent a friend over

with bail money.

DOYLE

Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it

down, Jeff.

JEFF

Just don't dally. Thorwald knows

he's being watched. He won't hang

around long.

DOYLE

If that ring checks out, we'll give

him an escort. So long.

MISS TORSO

(Faintly heard)

Have you heard that song he's been

writing?

MISS LONELY HEARTS

(Nods yes)

I'm glad I was here when he played

it.

JEFF

(Still looks out window)

Hello.

(No answer)

Hello, Doyle? Tom? Tom, I think

Thorwald's left. I don't see anything

of --

(He looks at receiver,

then:)

Hello.

THORWALD

What do you want from me?

THORWALD

Your friend -- the girl -- could

have turned me in. Why didn't she?

THORWALD

What is it you want? A lot of money?

I don't have any money.

THORWALD

Say something!

THORWALD

(Sudden loud anger)

Say something! Tell me what you want!

THORWALD

Can you get me that ring back?

JEFF

(Quietly)

No.

THORWALD

(Loud)

Tell her to bring it back!

JEFF

I can't. The police have it by now.

THORWALD

Then if the police get me -- you

won't be around to laugh!

THORWALD

I'll give you a good look out the

window.

LISA

Jeff! Jeff!

DOYLE

Creel! Your Thirty-eight!

LISA

Jeff -- Jeff darling!

LISA

(To the detectives)

Get an ambulance.

(Down to Jeff)

Don't move. Try to lie still.

JEFF

Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how

scared I was that you -- you might --

LISA

(Affectionately)

Shut up. I'm all right.

JEFF

(To Doyle)

Think you've got enough for a search

warrant now?

DOYLE

Oh sure. Sure. I can make it.

DETECTIVE

Lieutenant Doyle?

DOYLE (OFF)

(Looking up)

Yeah?

DETECTIVE

Thorwald's ready to take us on a

tour of the East River.

DOYLE

Did he say what was buried in the

flower bed?

DETECTIVE

Yeah. It's over in his apartment. In

a hat box. Wanna look?

STELLA

Oh, no thanks -- I don't want any of

part of her

(She pauses, then

does a surprised

take back to Doyle)

What did I say?

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE OUT:

THE END
