ANNA

So, there you are... I've been upstairs looking

all over for you...

FATHER

Oh, I thought you were already on the high

seas.

ANNA

No, not yet, Dad.

FATHER

Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a

sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?

ANNA

No, Dad, it isn't.

FATHER

And how long will you be away?

ANNA

Four or five days.

FATHER

(resignedly)

Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend

alone by myself and take a little rest. I

should be used to it by now.

ANNA

Used to what?

FATHER

To the fact of my retirement, not only as a

diplomat but also as a father.

ANNA

(protestingly and with a

deep sense of compassion)

But how could you say such a thing?

FATHER

Because it's true. After thirty years -- not

having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I

should at least allow myself to do so with my

own daughter.

ANNA

And have you any other truths to tell me?

FATHER

You already know what they are.

ANNA

You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of

you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.

FATHER

That type will never marry you, my child.

ANNA

Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't

wanted to marry him.

FATHER

It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.

CLAUDIA

Have you been waiting long? You'll have to

excuse me.

ANNA

Please hurry, Alvaro. We're late.

CLAUDIA

I'll wait for you here.

CLAUDIA

But where are you going?

ANNA

I'm thirsty.

CLAUDIA

If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour

and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...

ANNA

You know, I could just as well go without

seeing him today.

CLAUDIA

What! After giving us such a run around...

CLAUDIA

I see... so it's farewell to the yacht...and

farewell to the cruise...

ANNA

You know, it's terrible to be far away from one

another. Really, it's difficult to keep an

affair going when one is here and the other is

somewhere else. But, at the same time...it's

comforting.  Because it gives you a chance to

consider what you want and how you want it...

but when he's right there before you all the

time... well, he's right there...

(Then, with a sense

of exasperation)

Oh, let's go back....

SANDRO

I'll be right down.

SANDRO

Would you like to see my profile?

SANDRO

Well, what is it?

SANDRO

But your friend is waiting downstairs.

ANNA

She'll wait.

SANDRO

I have a feeling that you're not used to being

alone.

CLAUDIA

(glancing first at Sandro

and then at Anna)

That seems to apply to you also...

SANDRO

Don't be so humble.

CLAUDIA

How should I be ... arrogant?

SANDRO

But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't

Anna ever told you?

CLAUDIA

It was lovelier before.

SANDRO

Like this?

CLAUDIA

It's all my fault!

OLD MAN

And who do you think made that hole over there?

CLAUDIA

There's nothing much to laugh at.

SANDRO

And that's what I say, too. We could have all

been killed.

ANNA

I'm sorry ... but I can't help laughing...

GIULIA

It's as smooth and slick as oil.

CORRADO

I detest comparisons made with oil.

CLAUDIA

Did you sleep well?

ANNA

Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night

planning to do some thinking about a number of

things ... instead, I fell asleep.

CLAUDIA

I didn't know one could sleep so well on a

yacht. It lulls you ...

ANNA

It would be better for you to get some sun.

SANDRO

Shall we go for a swim?

CLAUDIA

Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too

dangerous.

GIULIA

At one time the Aeolian isles were all

volcanoes.

CORRADO

You must know your third grade geography book

inside out.

CLAUDIA

What is that one over there called?

CORRADO

That must be Basiluzzo.

CLAUDIA

Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo,

basiluzzo...

CORRADO

Now that one is Lisca Bianca.

ANNA

Oh, my goodness... All that yapping just for a

little swim.

SANDRO

Anna!

CLAUDIA

Stop ... stop the boat!

GIULIA

How's the water?

SANDRO

Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks,

Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come

on, Giulia ... your life is much too

circumscribed.

GIULIA

What has everybody got against me this morning?

PATRIZIA

Raimondo!

PATRIZIA

Why have we stopped?

RAIMONDO

(kissing her hand)

Lady Patrizia!

CORRADO

Aren't you going in for a swim, Patrizia?

PATRIZIA

What makes you think I would even dream of such

a thing? Raimondo, why don't you go in for a

dip?

PATRIZIA

Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?

RAIMONDO

I detest it. But, after all, what can you do...

It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt

myself.

RAIMONDO

Who ever said that man was originally a

creature of the sea!

PATRIZIA

I have never understood the islands. With all

that water around them, poor things ...

ANNA

When do you have to go back?

SANDRO

I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's

now in the process of negotiating for a

contract here in Sicily...

ANNA

Then how come you're not with him?

SANDRO

What a question... Because I want to be with

you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the

deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few

days... Isn't this water wonderful!

ANNA

I'd like to find a place where I can get some

peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere.

I'd like to try...

SANDRO

What could be more restful than this?...

(He opens his eyes and

is upright in the water)

Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?

GIULIA

(referring to Anna)

Where is she going?

SANDRO

Ask her.

SAILOR

I've always worked on pleasure boats... even

though it's more tiring.

CORRADO

Why?

SAILOR

Because the owners never seem to have any fixed

hours. For example, last night we kept right on

sailing... We didn't even have a chance to get

some sleep. Still, I like it better.

CORRADO

I'm going ashore to take a look around the

island. There are some ruins up there...

SANDRO

There too...

CORRADO

Well, we're still in Italy, you know!

SANDRO

What kind of a fish is that?

RAIMONDO

It's a cernia.

SANDRO

My God, it's enormous.

ANNA

A shark!... A shark!

SAILOR

Don't move,  lady... Stay where you are...

Stop! Everybody keep still.

ANNA

Stay away!

SANDRO

Anna...

CLAUDIA

(to Anna)

But how did you become aware of it? Did it

touch you?

GIULIA

I would have died.

PATRIZIA

... and how ugly they are ... with all those teeth...

CORRADO

(shouting from the shore)

What happened?

GIULIA

(shouting from the prow)

There's a shark in the area. Don't move from

where you are!

CORRADO

Who's moving?

SANDRO

Here, drink some cognac.

ANNA

It's nothing... really. Let's go back... It's

all over now.

ANNA

Only, I'd like to change. I'm a little cold.

PATRIZIA

But where did the shark go to?

ANNA

Which one shall I wear?

CLAUDIA

(picking up one of the two dresses)

This one is gorgeous.

ANNA

Then why don't you try it on?

ANNA

It looks better on you than it does on me...

You keep it.

ANNA

You know, that thing about the shark was all a

joke.

CLAUDIA

There's the difference between you and me: you

know how to put over certain things, and I

don't. Sometimes I envy you.

GIULIA

But aren't you afraid?

SAILOR

Ma'am, sharks never attack anybody. Anyway, the

raft is dark, and they wouldn't be able to see

it.

PATRIZIA

So, it is true that they're blind...

SANDRO

How are you?

ANNA

Fine. Can't you see so yourself?

ANNA

I have an urge to put my feet on some land.

Aren't you coming?

SANDRO

Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a

while.

ANNA

Wait for what?

PATRIZIA

Well, with a shark running loose around the

place, I for one won't get aboard that raft!

They'll have to catch it first. I want to see

it right here before my feet, dead or alive.

CLAUDIA

Better dead.

GIULIA

Will the three of us fit?

SAILOR

Sure, sure. There's plenty of room.

ANNA

Claudia, aren't you coming?

CLAUDIA

I'm certainly not going to swim across.

ANNA

We'll send the raft back to you.

GIULIA

And bring some cushions when you come, and a

towel...

SAILOR

Okay. Come ahead, come ahead.

SAILOR

I'm taking the boat right up to the shore, and

we'll let you get off from the gangplank as

soon as we get there.

PATRIZIA

What do you want, Raimondo? Do you want me? A

few years ago, maybe... but now... And, then,

at this hour of the day!

PATRIZIA

Come, Claudia, do come in... There's no

romance going on here.

PATRIZIA

There, have you seen enough now? Are you

satisfied?

PATRIZIA

(regretfully)

Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit

disappointed?... But I already told you...

RAIMONDO

If women's breasts were colored, yours would be

blue...

PATRIZIA

Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?

CLAUDIA

I would say he's pretty depraved.

PATRIZIA

Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a

child.

RAIMONDO

Patrizia, don't start in again... I would

rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to

love children.

PATRIZIA

You know, I don't love anybody.

RAIMONDO

(angrily)

I know, dammit, I know!

(turning to Claudia)

And just think -- if there ever was a woman so

right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of

dissipations, degradations, infidelities...

of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well,

anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of

laziness... of unwillingness.

PATRIZIA

He amuses me. I don't know of anything more

amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't

you find it so, Claudia?

CLAUDIA

One would have to be in love with somebody to

know that.

PATRIZIA

Have you ever been in love?

CLAUDIA

Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall

we go out?

CORRADO

If any of you get into your bathing suits

again, you can be sure we won't be seeing one

another for the rest of the year. I just can't

stand seeing anybody in the city after having

seen them naked on the beach.

CLAUDIA

Oh, how sweet... What a dear little darling!

GIULIA

Who are you talking to?

CLAUDIA

To the shark.

CORRADO

Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up

with me and take a look over there?

CLAUDIA

At what?

CORRADO

At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.

CLAUDIA

That sounds like a good idea. But why don't we

all go together?

GIULIA

Please, I beg of you, stay here.

CORRADO

(noticing Claudia's hesitancy)

Well?

CLAUDIA

Well, what?

CORRADO

Have you decided?

CLAUDIA

All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.

GIULIA

Why didn't you ask me to go with you?

CORRADO

Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins

I'm sure you would have said they were very,

very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful"

to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a

baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive

little heart that it throbs for anything.

CORRADO

(ironically)

But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why

shouldn't one say so?

GIULIA

(referring to Corrado)

He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to

let me know that he doesn't care about me any

more.

CORRADO

Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve

years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and

for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does

that please you?

CLAUDIA

(under her breath to

Anna and Sandro)

Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?

SANDRO

(with a faint smile)

And why haven't they left each other?

CLAUDIA

I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be

that they're in love?

SANDRO

Could be. They're the kind of people who are

capable of anything.

GIULIA

(to Corrado)

The trouble with you is that nobody can speak

to you, that's all.

SANDRO

(placatingly)

Giulia, don't you understand that the more

involved you become with people, the more

difficult it is to speak with them?

GIULIA

You men are all so dreadful!

SANDRO

I know we are. But as the years go by, we

become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?

CORRADO

I hope so.

CLAUDIA

How wonderful!

CORRADO

That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's

with us.

CLAUDIA

I think you're very sweet, Corrado.

CORRADO

More so than the shark?

CLAUDIA

There's no comparison.

CORRADO

Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?

ANNA

Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have

become used to being without you.

SANDRO

You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.

ANNA

A little more so this time.

SANDRO

So, it will just take you a little longer to

get over it.

ANNA

(angrily)

But I think we should talk about it. Or are you

fully convinced that we too won't understand

each other?

SANDRO

There will be plenty of time to talk about it

later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way

we'll have more time...

ANNA

In this case, getting married means nothing.

Aren't we already the same as being married?

And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already

the same as being married?

SANDRO

But why rattle your brains by arguing and

talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help

at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you,

Anna. Isn't I that enough?

ANNA

No. It's not enough... I told you before that I

would like to get away for a while and be alone.

SANDRO

But you just said that a month was too...

ANNA

(interrupting)

I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a

year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds

absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of

losing you makes me want to die... And yet...

I... I just don't have the same feeling for you

any more.

SANDRO

And what about yesterday... at my house...

didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?

ANNA

(angrily)

There you go... Must you always spoil

everything!

GIULIA

Looks like the weather is changing.

CORRADO

Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the

obvious? I can see for myself that the weather

is changing.

SAILOR

We'll have to get going.

CLAUDIA

And where's Anna?

(then, turning to the sailor)

Isn't she on the yacht?

SAILOR

I don't know... you see... we were taking a

little nap...

RAIMONDO

You've made some mistake there with the

bushes... that's why you can't finish it.

PATRIZIA

Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so

impatient?

CLAUDIA

Patrizia! ...

CLAUDIA

Is Anna there?

RAIMONDO

I don't think so.

RAIMONDO

She's not here.

SANDRO

(angrily, to himself)

This is the kind of behavior that drives me

crazy!

SANDRO

Did you find her?

CLAUDIA

It's a lamb!

CLAUDIA

Find anything?

SANDRO

No.

CORRADO

Perhaps she's taking a swim somewhere...

CORRADO

It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under

the sun. Now, look here. Look at this

structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro,

that's how you should design your houses.

SANDRO

Me?... I no longer have any interest in

building... And, then, where can you find

boulders of rock like this in Milan?

CLAUDIA

Somebody must live here!

CORRADO

(after examining the bread himself)

But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of

people who live here.

SAILOR

We had better get started. The storm may

break any minute now.

CLAUDIA

(angrily)

What do you mean! What about Anna?

SANDRO

(to the seaman)

Tell Lady Patrizia that we can't leave now. In

fact, we'll have to make a tour around the

island...

SAILOR

Wouldn't it be better if you told that to the

Lady yourself. I can't assume the

responsibility for keeping the boat here.

There's no place to tie it up... And then,

you know, it's got a flat bottom, and if the

sea gets a little too rough...

SANDRO

(angrily)

That doesn't make any difference! If we have to

stay, we'll stay!

PATRIZIA

Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a

cramp or something...

SANDRO

Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a

cramp, she would have managed to reach shore

somehow.

PATRIZIA

But you have to  consider all possibilities,

Sandro.

CORRADO

(calling out)

There are some footprints around here...

SANDRO

(calling from the stern, excitedly)

Patrizia!

RAIMONDO

(to the sailor)

Mario...Steer the boat that way.

SAILOR

Shall I turn back?

SANDRO

No. Now that we're here, let's have a look

around Basiluzzo.

(then turning to Patrizia)

When we were swimming, she swam out in that

direction.

SAILOR

It won't be easy to find a place to go ashore.

SANDRO

Let's try to be practical about this. The best

thing to do is for all of you to go to the

closest island that has a police station, or

something, and report the disappearance. I'll

remain here... because... well, I don't know,

but it seems to me that something may turn up.

Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.

CORRADO

Then let's get started... It's senseless to

waste any more time.

PATRIZIA

(to the sailor)

How long will it take to go there and come

back?

SAILOR

If there's a police station at Panarea, it

should take us a couple of hours. But if we

have to go to Lipari, it will take much longer.

Then it also depends on how rough the sea is.

CORRADO

I'll stay here also.

GIULIA

(alarmed)

But why?... What if it starts to rain?

CORRADO

If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.

CORRADO

(to Claudia, understandingly)

Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are

already two of us staying...

SANDRO

I'll go even further and say that her presence

here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could

be a great hindrance.

GIULIA

(calling to Corrado

from the boat)

Do you want some blankets? ... and something

to eat?

CLAUDIA

As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive...

Why, even this morning... that business about

the shark... it wasn't at all true.

SANDRO

And why do you tell us this only now?

CLAUDIA

I... I don't know... I didn't think it was

worthwhile... She was laughing over it...

CORRADO

Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she

invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?

CLAUDIA

(indicating Sandro)

Maybe you'd better ask him.

CORRADO

(to Sandro)

What were you and Anna arguing about?...

Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is

serious...

SANDRO

Nothing but the usual argument... The only

thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that

she said she had a need to be alone.

CLAUDIA

And how do you explain that?

SANDRO

Are you the owner of this place?

OLD MAN

No. The owners are in Australia.

SANDRO

But where did you come from?

OLD MAN

From Panarea. Why?

CORRADO

Ah, then it was you... I heard a boat leaving

here at two o'clock today...

OLD MAN

(scratching his head)

It must have been around four or five...

CORRADO

In the afternoon?

OLD MAN

No... in the morning. Why? What's happened?

SANDRO

Nothing... nothing at all!

CLAUDIA

But why don't you tell him?

(then turning to the old man)

A girl who was with us has disappeared.

OLD MAN

What do you mean... disappeared?  Was she

drowned?

CLAUDIA

No, she didn't drown... She just disappeared,

and nobody knows where.

SANDRO

And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you

tell him that too. That's what you believe,

isn't it?

CLAUDIA

Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts,

you would have been better off trying to

understand what Anna was thinking.

OLD MAN

Have you searched in back of the house to see

if she might have fallen off that cliff? Last

month that's what happened to one of my

sheep... I looked all over for it all day long

and it wasn't until late at night that I heard

it bleating... It had been there the whole

day... and was almost dead.

CLAUDIA

Anna! . . . Anna!

CORRADO

Come, Claudia...come back inside.

SANDRO

Are you feeling better?

CLAUDIA

(nodding yes)

I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.

SANDRO

You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?

CLAUDIA

Yes, very much so.

SANDRO

Has she ever spoken to you about me?

CLAUDIA

Occasionally, but always with affection.

SANDRO

And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for

her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a

certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or

didn't mean much to her.

CLAUDIA

I know. I keep asking myself what I could have

done to prevent all this from happening.

SANDRO

Whose boat is that?

OLD MAN

(astonished)

What boat?

SANDRO

Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound

of a motor?

OLD MAN

At this time of the year there are so many

boats...

SANDRO

And how come you're up so early?

OLD MAN

Early? Is four in the morning early for you?

GIULIA

How did you spend the night?... In that hut?...

And what did you have to eat?

CORRADO

What do you think?

GIULIA

We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First at

Panarea, where there weren't any boats... then

at Lipari, where everybody was asleep... And

the phone call to Rome...

PATRIZIA

We had to notify her father.

CORRADO

Yes, that was a very good idea.

PATRIZIA

He'll be here sometime today.

(then turning to Sandro who

has just arrived on the scene)

I also phoned my house in Milan... but Ettore

had already left.

MARSHAL

(to Sandro)

Anything new develop?

SANDRO

Unfortunately, no.

MARSHAL

Very well. First of all, I'll have them search

the waters around the island. I brought two

frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look

up around here.

SANDRO

Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses,

you'll need some rope and ladders...

MARSHAL

Don't worry, we've got everything.

SANDRO

Another thing; there's an old man who lives

here on the island...

MARSHAL

(interrupting)

I know, I know. One thing at a time.

PATRIZIA

No, who wants crackers... Why don't you go and

have some coffee made instead?

CARABINIERE

(calling up to the Marshal)

Nothing here!

CORRADO

Don't look at me like that, Marshal...  I had

nothing to do with it.

PATRIZIA

(referring to the frogmen below)

Let's hope they don't find her... If they do,

they would find her dead.

SANDRO

Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a

current that passes by here and ends up at

another island... I don't know which... He

wants to send one of his men over to have a

look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask

Raimondo to go with him?

PATRIZIA

I don't see why I should mind.

CLAUDIA

(to Sandro)

I think that you might go and have a look

yourself.

SANDRO

Yes, maybe that is better.

PATRIZIA

(to Claudia)

What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.

CLAUDIA

(rising)

Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was

awake all night.

RAIMONDO

(to the frogman)

What is it?

FROGMAN

An ancient vase. There's a buried city under

here. It's full of this stuff.

PATRIZIA

(ironically)

Come on, Corrado, tell us what century it

belongs to.

GIULIA

Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to

us as a gift?

CORRADO

Really! So that you can stuff it with your

geraniums.

PATRIZIA

(to Sandro)

But aren't you supposed to be on your way?

SANDRO

Yes... I'm going... I'm going now.

SANDRO

(to the carabiniere)

It's already two hours... What are we going to

do?

CARABINIERE

It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for

the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.

ELDERLY GENTLEMAN

And sometimes even twenty-four... depending on

the wind...

CARABINIERE

If the girl disappeared yesterday afternoon,

we'll have to wait at least until three or four

o'clock.

VOICES

It belongs to me... We found it...

GENTLEMAN

Back... Stand back!

CARABINIERE

(to the islanders)

You see? It contains cigarettes. We'll have to

confiscate it.

CARABINIERE

(to Sandro)

These people are contemptible. They have no

sense of dignity at all.

SANDRO

(referring to the crate)

And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?

CARABINIERE

It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At

least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I

really can't understand it. Contraband

cigarettes on that island! It's the first time

that ever happened.

SANDRO

Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.

CARABINIERE

But how could we...at a time like this when we

just... well, let's at least first have a look

around the other islands. Could be that

something might turn up there.

SANDRO

(impatiently)

But even here we were supposed to find who

knows what... And all we bring back with us is

a crate of cigarettes.

CARABINIERE

(shrugging his shoulders)

As you wish.

MARSHAL

(to the old man)

... Is it also true that you saw no boat around

here at Lisca between yesterday and this

morning?

OLD MAN

How many times do I have to tell you, Marshal,

that I was at Panarea.

MARSHAL

I believe you, I believe you... But I'm also

certain that you're hiding something from me. I

can see it written all over your face... And

you know that I have never liked your face. And

if you want to know something, that gentleman

over there...

(indicating Anna's father)

...who's a very important person... doesn't

like it either. So, just keep that in mind.

I'll talk to you later.

ANNA'S FATHER

I presume by this method that you'll be able to

uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or

an article of clothing... In other words,

something which your men have not been able to

find as yet.

MARSHAL

Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging

to the girl who has run away is still here on

this island...

ANNA'S FATHER

(resentfully)

Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not

a fugitive.

MARSHAL

I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that

way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...

ANNA'S FATHER

I understand very well. Only I don't want any

rash assumptions to be made.

MARSHAL

Here's her valise, sir.

CLAUDIA

Do you want me to open it?

ANNA'S FATHER

Yes, please.

ANNA'S FATHER

This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you

think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who

reads the Bible could not have committed an act

of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I

remember when I was in China, many years ago, I

happened to be involved in a similar situation,

concerning an English woman, the wife of

Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine.

There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at

the time that whatever had happened, that clue

alone had definitely ruled out the possibility

of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said,

that whoever reads the Bible believes in God

and therefore...

(then, turning to Claudia in an

almost supplicating tone of voice)

No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of

fact, I was right... The woman was found two

days later. It was a case of amnesia.

MARSHAL

Sir, if you have no objections, may we start

the search?

ATTENDANT

(to the Marshal)

Get everybody out of the way...

MARSHAL

Okay. I'll send them down to that part of the

beach over there...

CLAUDIA

It's because of this... The dress... It's

because of this dress. Anna gave it to me

yesterday, right after the swim.

CORRADO

And what are we going to do now?

MARSHAL

We'll try again.

PATRIZIA

But is it really necessary? Those two

beasts... How absurd!

GIULIA

Sandro's here.

ANNA'S FATHER

(coldly)

I don't know him.

GIULIA

It seems to me that at a moment like this...

ANNA'S FATHER

I don't want to know him.

SANDRO

Claudia, listen ... Claudia.

CORRADO

(to Sandro)

I didn't think you'd be back so early.

CARABINIERE

(interrupting)

We didn't check the other islands, so...

CORRADO

And why didn't you go there?

CARABINIERE

(referring to Sandro)

He wanted to come back.

MARSHAL

Up until now those smugglers were operating

only around the Palermo area. This will be a

nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo...

Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and

have them give you instructions on what to do

with this crate.

CORRADO

So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might

have also been that of these smugglers. Could it

be possible, then, that Anna...?

MARSHAL

(evading Corrado's question

and pursuing his own thoughts)

I wonder where they could have unloaded the

stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.

CORRADO

I was saying... it might even be possible that

Anna had left with them.

MARSHAL

But for what reason would she have wanted to go

away?

CORRADO

Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons

for going away, anyone of us might have three

thousand of them. So you can assume that she

had them. What I want to know, is it possible

that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?

MARSHAL

I think it's possible.

A SAILOR

(calling from the patrol boat)

Marshal!... Headquarters is calling. They have

an important message.

MARSHAL

What is it about?

SAILOR

They've stopped a suspicious-looking boat a

few miles from here... yesterday afternoon. The

crew has been taken to Milazzo for questioning.

CORRADO

Did you hear that? What do you plan on doing?

ANNA'S FATHER

(resignedly)

We are in the hands of God.

SANDRO

That's true...But in the meantime, as far as

I'm concerned, it's absolutely necessary to go

to Milazzo.

(directly to Anna's father)

I know that you have no desire to meet me, and

I shall take pains not to impose myself upon

you. But, besides you, I am the closest person

to your daughter...

ANNA'S FATHER

However that may be, at this moment my daughter

has more need of her father than of you.

SANDRO

Pardon me for being so frank, but there are

certain things that a father -- especially a

father like you --cannot understand. So don't

be stubborn. I'm coming with you.

SANDRO

Patrizia, what are you going to do?

PATRIZIA

What do you want us to do? I don't know

myself... But we'll do something.

SANDRO

I'll go and get my valise.

PATRIZIA

We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In

fact, Ettore should already be there.

SANDRO

(intervening)

Good. Then I'll meet you there.

CLAUDIA

I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour

around the islands.

PATRIZIA

To do what?

CLAUDIA

I just can't leave without first searching

those islands, one by one.

PATRIZIA

But aren't you tired? I can just about manage

to stand on my feet!

(then turning around to look

for Raimondo, she calls out)

Raimondo!

RAIMONDO

Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.

PATRIZIA

Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please

take care of her luggage? Thanks.

SAILOR

No, sir, Lieutenant, we weren't even able to

drop anchor once ... the sea was too rough.

LIEUTENANT

Okay. Just sign here.

(turning to a guard

standing at the door)

Have the next one come in. He's the last,

isn't he?

LIEUTENANT

They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home.

Is that right?

YOUNG SAILOR

Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my

father, too.

LIEUTENANT

So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh?

You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can

see that you get some assistance from the

government. But first there's a little

formality we've got to take care of. Just a

few questions and then we can all go to

lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped

anchor three times...

YOUNG SAILOR

Yes, sir. Three times.

LIEUTENANT

(to Sandro and Anna's father)

Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning

to contradict each other.

(then, facing the sailor again)

Now look here, your friend just swore to me

that you weren't able to do any fishing at all

because the sea was too rough... And what about

the other boat?

YOUNG SAILOR

What other boat?

LIEUTENANT

Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you

men throwing those crates overboard. What have

you got to say about that?

YOUNG SAILOR

(stuttering)

I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was

sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ...

I'm all mixed up and ...

SANDRO

But what are you saying?... What are you

saying?

LIEUTENANT

Now look here, I'm ready to forget the whole

thing: the cigarettes, the contraband --

everything. If you would only tell me... you or

your friends... whether the girl was aboard

your boat and how far she went.

LIEUTENANT

(to Anna's father)

Just as I thought. Even if you caught them in

the act, they'd deny it. They always deny

everything. And then, in this case, if they

were to admit having had the girl aboard, it

would mean they'd be admitting to the charge

of carrying contraband. Oh, it's easy to say:

talk! But if they did talk, the following

morning you'd find them cold dead in front of

their doorstep.

ANNA'S FATHER

I think it would be worth my while to take a

run over to Palermo. The Chief of Police there

is a very good friend of mine and I'm sure

he'll do whatever he can. I feel we're wasting

our time here... Excuse me, Lieutenant. I hope

we see each other again under better

circumstances. And thanks for everything.

LIEUTENANT

At any rate, we'll continue investigating. I

know that headquarters has sent out an alarm to

all areas...

SANDRO

(showing the newspaper

to the Lieutenant)

Tell me, Lieutenant, do you happen to know this

F.Z. who wrote this article here?

LIEUTENANT

That's Francesco Zuria. He's the news

correspondent.

SANDRO

Where can we locate him? Don't you think that

by offering a reward to anyone who can give us

some information...

LIEUTENANT

Zuria is in Messina. You might try him. Shall

we phone him?

SERGEANT

Have you any instructions for me, Lieutenant?

May I return to Lipari?

LIEUTENANT

Yes. With whom did you leave the crate of

cigarettes?

SERGEANT

I left it at the warehouse.

SANDRO

Pardon me, Sergeant, but when did you get back?

SERGEANT

About two hours ago.

SANDRO

And the young lady who was with you?

SERGEANT

I don't know... She said she had to catch a

train.

SANDRO

Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?

CLAUDIA

Yes.

SANDRO

Then I'll go with you.

CLAUDIA

Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone

with information to get in touch with them.

SANDRO

Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk

with them...

CLAUDIA

Yes, you should go.

SANDRO

But then when will we see each other?

CLAUDIA

I know it's difficult. But if you go on like

this it will become even more difficult.

CLAUDIA

Please, don't look so solemn... And don't wait

for the train to come in.

CLAUDIA

Please, please leave. I don't want to look out

of the window and wave to you with a

handkerchief.

CLAUDIA

Go ahead, now say something! I want to know

just what it is we have to say to each other.

CLAUDIA

Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I

don't want to see you... How can I make it

clear to you?...Why did you come?

SANDRO

I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.

CLAUDIA

But sooner or later we've got to end this

relationship. And it's better to do it right

now.

SANDRO

I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's

idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For

whom? If Anna were here I might understand your

scruples. But she's not...

CLAUDIA

(deeply wounded)

Oh, Sandro...

SANDRO

I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But

isn't it better to look things squarely in the

eye?

CLAUDIA

For me they are exactly as they were when we

met three days ago -- just three days ago...

don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I

guess they aren't like that any more. My God,

is it possible to forget in such a short time,

for things to change so quickly?

SANDRO

It takes even less.

CLAUDIA

But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used

to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I

have never been so upset in my life. Sandro,

why don't you help me?

SANDRO

I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia,

is for us to be together.

CLAUDIA

No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's

make believe nothing happened. And when we get

to the next station, get off.

SANDRO

And what about you?

CLAUDIA

Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.

WOMAN'S VOICE

I work there but I'm really a stranger.

MAN'S VOICE

I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you

and she has often spoken to me about you.

WOMAN'S VOICE

And who is she? Does she work in Catania?

MAN'S VOICE

Yes, she takes care of the garden.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the

villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.

MAN'S VOICE

So? That's logical. You see, both being

gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.

WOMAN'S VOICE

And what did they say about me?

MAN'S VOICE

They told me that you were a very nice girl,

that you always mind your business... In other

words, things of that sort.

WOMAN'S VOICE

We have a radio like this, too.

MAN'S VOICE

No, not like this one.

WOMAN'S VOICE

And why wouldn't we have one like this?

MAN'S VOICE

Because this is a Chinese radio.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Certainly a radio this small is very practical.

It's especially useful for... I don't know...

for traveling.

MAN'S VOICE

But for you, what comes first: music or love?

WOMAN'S VOICE

Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has

to look around, but to get a radio, all you

have to do is buy one.

MAN'S VOICE

Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man,

and I know what's what: first love, and then

music.

SANDRO

Claudia, listen to me...

CLAUDIA

No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...

CLAUDIA

Promise that you won't try to look for me...

you shouldn't try to look for me any more...

SANDRO

But why, Claudia?... Why?

SANDRO

Even if you chase me away, I... Claudia, let's

not wait any longer... After, it will be too

late ... Come with me.

PRINCESS

Did you have a good trip? It is such a

magnificent day! I am very happy that Sicily is

able to give you so warm a welcome. And you do

deserve it. You're such a lovely blonde. Come,

my dear.

PRINCESS

And where are you from?

CLAUDIA

From Rome.

PRINCESS

Oh, how nice! So, you're from Rome... And would

you happen to know of some intelligent

clergyman in Rome who might be willing to come

here and stay with us? We have our own private

little chapel... It is a masterpiece, with

seventeenth-century frescoes... and the

remains of all our dead ancestors, a wonderful

collection... He would find it very convenient

there, and could say his own masses. Then he

would have to spend a little time with my

husband, who never sees anyone, to keep him

occupied.

CLAUDIA

An intelligent clergyman, Princess? But I

think the intelligent clergymen of today have

so many other things to do.

PRINCESS

Well, perhaps one with a little physical

handicap. One who is slightly lame, for

example.

GIULIA

Well, finally! We were beginning to get worried

about you, too.

PATRIZIA

But where did you finally end up?

CLAUDIA

It was futile. We went all over.

CLAUDIA

(referring to Anna)

But why does she do these things?

(she takes a sip from

her glass, then rises)

I can't stand it any more.

GIULIA

(to Corrado and Ettore)

But how can you carry on a discussion in this

heat?

CORRADO

When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is

affected only by the cold.

ETTORE

(noticing Claudia)

And who is this?

PATRIZIA

This is Claudia, Anna's friend...

(to Claudia)

You've never met my husband, have you?

ETTORE

By the way, have you phoned him?

CORRADO

You mean Sandro? I told you already. He's not

in. At least he's not at the hotel.

ETTORE

Now look what has to go and happen... At a time

when I'll be needing him. How can we discuss

things when we lack dates and figures?...

PATRIZIA

But didn't he say he was coming here...

ETTORE

Well, what are you all waiting for? Send a car

out to get him. He can't be more than a couple

of hundred miles away...

GIULIA

To me, the fact that hasn't shown up is a good

sign. Do you want to bet that he's found Anna?

ETTORE

Maybe. But do you know that forty thousand

persons a year disappear in Italy without

leaving a single trace behind them. Forty

thousand! Almost as much as the entire

population of San Siro... Raimondo, will you go

and see if you can locate Sandro?

RAIMONDO

Okay.

PATRIZIA

First let the poor thing have something to eat.

ETTORE

It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a

meal.

PRINCESS

I've never met this Sandro. What kind of a

person is he?... He couldn't have done her in

himself, by any chance?

ETTORE

(breaking out into a loud laugh)

Sandro?... Oh, sure... I can see Sandro calling

Anna over to him and saying: Listen, Anna, I

intend to get rid of you, but since it's so

painful and complicated... and besides, I

don't happen to have a gun on me... why don't

you do me a favor and get rid of yourself on

your own...

GIULIA

My God, how could we joke over something like

that! We should be ashamed of ourselves.

PRINCESS

(rising)

Come on, let's go.

GIULIA

(to Claudia, referring

to the young man)

Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's

eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do

you know -- he paints.

GOFFREDO

Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you

need is to buy some oils and start painting.

Even Rembrandt did the same.

ETTORE

But... where is the Prince?... Is he well?

PRINCESS

The last time I saw him, the day before

yesterday, it seemed he was well.

ETTORE

Princess, why don't you sell this villa? I

would turn it into a lovely psychiatric clinic.

PRINCESS

It's a little like that already.

FIRST YOUNG MAN

Who is it, Sophia Loren?

SECOND YOUNG MAN

Oh, no! It's some model from Turin with a

low-cut dress.

OTHER VOICES

It's Queen Saroya... I saw her... So, who

could it be?

THIRD YOUNG MAN

They've torn her dress... She's almost nude...

She ran into the shop to hide herself...

SANDRO

(to one of the newspapermen)

Which one of you is Zuria?

NEWSPAPERMAN

He's inside.

SANDRO

Zuria?

ZURIA

Yes. Until proven otherwise.

SANDRO

I would like to ask you something.

ZURIA

Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?

MANAGER

I phoned you, Chief, because, in view of the

situation... I thought it best...

GIRL

I came down here to buy a foulard... Suddenly

I realized that little by little, directly

behind me, I was being followed by so many

men, and more and more of them kept coming.

CHIEF OF POLICE

Well, I should think so... Dressed like that.

GIRL

But I have always gone around like this,

everywhere in the world. Nothing like this has

ever happened to me before.

ZURIA

(to the girl)

How old are you?

GIRL

Nineteen. My name is Gloria Perkins. I'm

married and a writer by profession. I write in

a trance, almost always in contact with people

who are dead. Tolstoi, for example, or

Shakespeare. But the movies also interest me.

ZURIA

How do you find the men of Messina? Are you

shocked by their warm display of friendliness?

GIRL

No, why should I be shocked? We're in Italy,

not Finland.

ZURIA

And how were you received in Palermo?

GIRL

In Palermo I was with my husband. Now I'm

going to Capri to write an article for the

Tourist Office.

ZURIA

She did exactly the same thing in Palermo.

CHIEF OF POLICE

(to the girl)

If you want to go back to your hotel... we're

ready to escort you.

GIRL

Oh, yes, thank you...

ZURIA

Do you like her?

ZURIA

She costs a hundred thousand lire.

SANDRO

You're kidding!

ZURIA

No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all

this? It's one of the many ways she can put

herself on display. When you bait the trap, the

mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it

wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand

lire represents my whole month's salary, well...

But you had something you wanted to ask me?

SANDRO

I read one of your articles regarding the

disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.

ZURIA

Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to

write a story about this thing that just

happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned

out.

SANDRO

(impatiently)

Now listen, if I had any information, I

wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see

that you, too, lack any information ...

ZURIA

As a matter of fact, I've already had several

phone calls on that article. One said they had

seen the missing girl in an automobile

somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw

her on the pier talking with some strange

sailors... Could be she secretly left the

island by boat...

SANDRO

Is that possible?

ZURIA

Who knows?... Another one has it that she

entered a store in Troina. This information

comes from the storekeeper himself who stated

that such and such a girl had bought I don't

know what in his store... at Troina.

SANDRO

Is that far from here?

ZURIA

About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give

you the name of the storekeeper.

SANDRO

Yes... of course... But you should also print

that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow

morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't

it?... I mean, it's widely read...

ZURIA

Yes, but why do you think our readers would be

interested in such news now? Even if I sent it,

the editors wouldn't print it.

SANDRO

You really must do me this one favor.

ZURIA

Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?

SANDRO

Then let's call it a business proposition.

Something to round out your salary.

PATRIZIA

Are you ready? I'm not. That's all we needed --

a cocktail party... The vitality some people

have irritates me!

(indicating the wig on her head)

How does it look?

CLAUDIA

(ironically)

It's divine!

PATRIZIA

You say that just to flatter me.

CLAUDIA

Do you consider that a compliment?

PATRIZIA

No.

GIULIA

He wants to show me his paintings. He won't

let go  of me  anymore.  Poor thing, he must

have a crush on me...

GIULIA

(even more excited)

Please, you come too...

CLAUDIA

But for what reason should I come there?

GIULIA

Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with

him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have

you noticed his eyes?

GOFFREDO

Giulia...

GIULIA

Here I am.

GIULIA

Claudia, come and see. It's a nude.

CLAUDIA

They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.

GIULIA

(to Goffredo)

But why all nudes?

GOFFREDO

Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a

woman.

GIULIA

And where do you find the models?

GOFFREDO

Oh, there are as many as one wants.

GIULIA

(turning to Claudia)

I thought the model was something obsolete

nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?

GOFFREDO

It's strange how anxious women are to display

themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.

GIULIA

But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.

GOFFREDO

(with a grave, youthful sensuality)

Why don't you try?

GIULIA

Me... Goffredo, you're mad!

(turning to Claudia)

He's mad.

CLAUDIA

Not really.

GIULIA

Don't you ever paint men?

GOFFREDO

Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint

you a beautiful portrait.

GIULIA

But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more

beautiful than me.

GOFFREDO

(insistent)

But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.

GIULIA

(timidly)

I appeal to you more?

CLAUDIA

(almost unconsciously)

Giulia!

GIULIA

And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he

wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny

little heart is beating like mad, and that at

this moment, it's the only thing that interests

me. Is that clear?

CLAUDIA

It couldn't be any clearer.

GIULIA

Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?

CLAUDIA

I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close

the door.

RAIMONDO

He's not at the hotel... and he probably wasn't

even in Milazzo. The room clerk said he rented

a car...

PATRIZIA

Claudia... Let's go.

CLAUDIA

I'm not coming.

PATRIZIA

But then why did you bother changing?

CORRADO

Giulia is like Oscar Wilde; give her the

superfluous and she will do without the

essential.

ETTORE

That's him; he'd die if he didn't have somebody

to quote. He comes up with quotations like that

even at a board of directors meeting...

HUSBAND

Be patient, I can't remember everything.

SANDRO

(indicating the newspaper article)

But it even says what she bought: a bar of soap!

So there's no point in making believe you can't

remember.

WIFE

"A young female stranger, whose description

corresponds with that of the missing girl, came

into my store..."

WIFE

She came and then she left. With him. But this

one won't admit it.

(turning upon her husband furiously)

You think I wasn't aware of it...

HUSBAND

But if I was carrying on with the girl, why

would I want to give any of this information to

the newspaper?

WIFE

That's what I'd like to know myself.

HUSBAND

Fine, that makes two of us who want to know. In

fact, three, with him.

HUSBAND

Ah, Lady Amalia, would you be interested in

knowing why I told the newspapers about a

certain girl who came here the other day and

then disappeared?

LADY AMALIA

Disappeared? Who is she? ... Where? When?

HUSBAND

And that makes four. Anybody else?...

SANDRO

You have to be precise. Did this girl enter

your store or didn't she?

WIFE

(shouting)

Yes!

SANDRO

(ignoring her)

Was she blonde or brunette?

HUSBAND

(calmly)

Brunette.

WIFE

(contradicting him)

Blonde.

SANDRO

How was she dressed?

HUSBAND

I don't quite remember. Seems to me she wore a

black dress.

WIFE

(intervening sarcastically)

He doesn't look at dresses, he looks at what's

under them.

SANDRO

Pardon me, but has anyone else been here asking

about this girl?

HUSBAND

No ... I don't think so.

SANDRO

Thanks.

CLAUDIA

Any news?

SANDRO

Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However,

there is some slight indication...

HUSBAND

Listen... In the paper they forgot to say that

as soon as the girl left here she took the bus

to Noto. The bus leaves from the square, over

there. I saw her clearly... I came to the door

to see her off... She was a beautiful girl.

Lovely pair of legs!

WIFE

You're from Rome, aren't you? I knew right away

because I'm from Viterbo... He was a soldier

there and so...

(indicating her husband, and

then quickly continuing)

I don't like it very much, here.

HUSBAND

(interrupting)

Then why don't you go back?

CLAUDIA

How long have you been married?

WIFE

Three months.

SANDRO

Well... Thanks for the information.

SANDRO

It's better if we present a happy picture, no?

SANDRO

(to the driver)

Tell the Signora Patrizia that we are

continuing the search...and that the Signorina

Claudia will manage to survive somehow...

DRIVER

Did your car break down?

SANDRO

No. I only want some information.

SANDRO

We're searching for a girl of about

twenty-five... Seems she boarded this bus two

days ago, in the afternoon... You should

remember her because she was a stranger around

here...

DRIVER

She was a little nervous... dark-haired ... with

a kerchief around her head?

ASSISTANT

Two days ago... wasn't there that midwife on

the bus, too? Sure, that's right, and she was

talking to some young woman ...

SANDRO

Can you tell me where she got off?

ASSISTANT

All I can tell you is that the midwife is from

X...

SANDRO

Okay, thanks.

CLAUDIA

My God ... Let's hope it was her.

MIDWIFE

I only exchanged a few casual words with her,

as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...

SANDRO

And do you remember where she got off?

MIDWIFE

Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.

CLAUDIA

After that, you didn't see her anymore?

MIDWIFE

What are you trying to insinuate, young lady?

Why should I have seen her again? I don't do

anything that's illegitimate.

CLAUDIA

Oh, no... What are you saying? I'm not

insinuating anything...

MIDWIFE

And furthermore, my dear young lady... because

you really are a dear, you know ...if the story

of that girl is merely a pretext, let us say,

to get in touch with her, then I feel it is my

duty to warn her. These things are very, very

dangerous, especially in a neighborhood like

this where people occupy themselves more with

other people's affairs than their own.

SANDRO

Then you should also be able to tell me where a

young girl might stay in Noto; are there any

hotels or rooming houses?

MIDWIFE

There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina,

near the municipal building. As for rooming

houses, I don't know...

SANDRO

Thank you.

MIDWIFE

Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service

any time.

CLAUDIA

Look at that bridge! Who knows why they even

bothered to make it...

CLAUDIA

Look at that: a factory... a station... and

look at those tracks, all full of weeds... But

why?

CLAUDIA

(faintly audible)

It's late... We should be going.

CLAUDIA

Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a

town, it's a cemetery.

SANDRO

Who knows why they all left...

CLAUDIA

Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.

SANDRO

Are you joking?

CLAUDIA

Don't think that I want to save myself from any

embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting

Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say

certain things easier if you're alone. Please,

Sandro, do try to understand me... It would

look like I was trying to influence you, to

force you, to control you... and that makes me

feel uncomfortable...

CLAUDIA

Some cigarettes, please... Do you have any?...

Nazionali with filters ...

SANDRO

What is it, Claudia?

CLAUDIA

Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so

ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so

small... I hate myself ...

SANDRO

Does it please you to say such things?

CLAUDIA

Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...

SANDRO

Then why do you say them?

CLAUDIA

Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because

if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love

you," I would believe you...

Sandro is about to say the phrase, somewhat jokingly in the hope that it

CLAUDIA

No... Because then I'd force you to swear it,

I'd force you to tell me an infinite amount of

things... and that wouldn't be right, it

couldn't be right... It would be absurd.

SANDRO

Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would

mean nothing much can be done about it.

CLAUDIA

But just think -- the very same things you had

said to her who knows how many times... maybe

even just before we left, while I was waiting

outside your place...

SANDRO

So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with

her, as I am now with you.

SANDRO

I have never seen a woman like you, who needs

to see everything so clearly.

MAN

Excuse me, but would you mind pulling that cord

for me?

MAN

Thank you.

SANDRO

At one time, all these houses were convents.

SANDRO

Look! What a fantastic scene! What movement,

what disorder! They were very much concerned

with scenographic effects... an extraordinary

sense of liberty...

SANDRO

Really, I've got to stop this business with

Ettore... I would like to go back and start

working on my own projects again. You know, I

had many ideas...

CLAUDIA

And why did you drop them?

SANDRO

Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate

for the construction of a school. It took me

only a day and a half to finish it, and I got

paid six million lire. Ever since then I've

been doing estimates for other people's

designs.

SANDRO

Why are you looking at me like that?

CLAUDIA

I'm sure you'd be able to design some very

lovely things.

SANDRO

I don't know about that. And then, who's

interested in beautiful things nowadays?

SANDRO

Claudia, let's get married?

CLAUDIA

(astonished)

What! Get married?

SANDRO

Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you

say?

CLAUDIA

What do I say? What can I say? No. At least,

not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of

it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did

you have to ask me?

SANDRO

You look at me as though I had said something

foolish...

CLAUDIA

And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you

really sure...that you want to marry... me?

SANDRO

That's why I asked you...

CLAUDIA

So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so

much simpler... that people could just come

together by the color of their hair or the size

of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear?

Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm

sorry, I wear size 8.

SANDRO

Are you ready?

CLAUDIA

(ironically)

But why am I so infatuated with you?

SANDRO

(smiling)

Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot

outside...

CLAUDIA

Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...

SANDRO

(leaving)

Okay. I understand. See you later.

CLAUDIA

And you leave me here all alone... in this

hotel room...

SANDRO

As soon as you're ready, you can come down and

catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right

outside on the square.

CLAUDIA

(teasingly)

Very well. But you must first tell me that when

you go out without me it's like going out

without one of your legs. Go ahead, have a look

around the town all by yourself, but you'll

have to hobble along on only one leg. And you

must also tell me that you are filled with a

great desire to embrace my shadow on the

walls... Then you must tell me...

(suddenly her tone of voice

changes and she becomes

quite serious)

You must tell me that you love me.

SANDRO

But you know it already. Why must I tell you?

CLAUDIA

So, you wonder why?

SANDRO

Then I'll see you later.

CLAUDIA

Okay. In a few minutes.

SANDRO

It's closed. Isn't there any custodian or

caretaker inside?

COACHMAN

(apathetically)

Nobody there.

SANDRO

But it says it's open from 9:30 to 10:30., and

it's ten o'clock now...  That's a fine way to

greet tourists.

COACHMAN

Tourists? Last year a few Frenchmen came here

and they all walked around in their bathing

suits. So they were made to understand that it

was better if they didn't come at all.

SANDRO

Are you the custodian?

CUSTODIAN

Yes, come right in.

HOTEL MANAGER

Go ahead, keep right on singing...

HOTEL MANAGER

(to Claudia)

Excuse me for interfering, but I've heard about

that girl... Here in this place one gets to

know about everything... That girl you're

looking for... Why don't you try asking at the

youth hostel in Pergusa? Almost all the young

girls traveling through here end up there.

CLAUDIA

I was just coming out to meet you. How come

you're back so soon?

CLAUDIA

Sandro ...What's the matter?

SANDRO

Nothing.

CLAUDIA

No, Sandro... Please...

SANDRO

Why?

CLAUDIA

No reason why...

CLAUDIA

What's the matter with you?

CLAUDIA

Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You

seem like an entirely different person ...

SANDRO

And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have

a new kind of adventure.

CLAUDIA

What are you saying?

SANDRO

I was only joking, really... Can't I make a

joke? And now you've got to tell me why you

don't want to.

CLAUDIA

Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...

SANDRO

But what?

CLAUDIA

Did the hotel manager speak to you about that

place nearby?

SANDRO

Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like

staying to listen to what she had to say. If we

had to listen to everybody...

CLAUDIA

No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we

haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even

with Anna's father. We should have at least

sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he

must be feeling awfully lonely.

SANDRO

I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're

the least suitable persons to be with him. And

as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he

is?

CLAUDIA

Come, let's go. Pack your things, and I'll get

mine ready too.

PATRIZIA

Well, I'm looking for somebody else and who do

I find but you.

CLAUDIA

How are you?

CLAUDIA

Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?

PATRIZIA

Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.

PATRIZIA

You look so wonderfully tanned.

PATRIZIA

And here's Sandro.

(he kisses her hand)

Why don't you two go upstairs and change?

SANDRO

Yes, we will.

PATRIZIA

Did you manage to find good rooms?

SANDRO

They didn't seem too good.

PATRIZIA

You should have told Ettore. He always manages

to get what he wants.

SANDRO

Ettore must be fed up with me by now.

PATRIZIA

Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well

that he'll forgive you anything; just as long

as you admit to him that you're a worse driver

than he is...

CLAUDIA

How do you manage to put up with all this

confusion? You always said people bore you.

PATRIZIA

You shouldn't always take me seriously.

Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my

mother and now my husband; both of them are

like dynamos.

SANDRO

Your mother?

PATRIZIA

Yes, even I had a mother. She was part

Austrian, but she was still my mother. My

childhood was like a tennis match; they

bounced me back and forth, here and there...

CLAUDIA

My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.

PATRIZIA

What do you mean by sensible?

CLAUDIA

It means being without money.

PATRIZIA

See you soon, then.

SANDRO

(commenting under his breath)

You see? Just like a robot.

SANDRO

Come in.

CLAUDIA

Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too

involved tomorrow.

SANDRO

Aren't you going to change?

CLAUDIA

You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.

SANDRO

Sure, that's what I said...

SANDRO

Wow, it's ice cold...

CLAUDIA

Sandro, I'm not coming down.

SANDRO

Why?

CLAUDIA

I'm too sleepy.

SANDRO

Sleep is something one must learn to overcome.

I learned how to do it when I was a child. I

never slept. And I had friends who even slept

less than I did. The one who went to bed first,

paid a penalty. And we really didn't do

anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a

cafe and discuss things for a while... then

we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to

some drunkard... watch them putting up posters

or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing

by... or go for a stroll around the market

place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl

in the neighborhood by standing in front of her

window and calling out her name...

SANDRO

You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to

get up tomorrow?

CLAUDIA

Late, very late.

SANDRO

Did you know that when I was a boy I wanted to

be a diplomat? Can you imagine that! Me, a

diplomat? It's strange but I never thought I'd

be rich. I saw myself living in a rooming house,

full of geniuses...

SANDRO

Instead, I have two apartments, one in Rome and

one in Milan. As far as genius goes, it's a

habit I've never formed. What do you think of

that?

CLAUDIA

I look at things differently... But maybe it's

best we talk about it some other time. Do you

mind turning off that light over there?

SANDRO

Good night, my love.

CLAUDIA

Good night. Tell me that you love me.

SANDRO

I love you.

CLAUDIA

Tell me once more.

SANDRO

I don't love you.

CLAUDIA

(smiling)

I deserve it.

SANDRO

That's not true. I love you.

ETTORE

Well, finally... Come, I'll introduce you to my

friends.

SANDRO

I want to take a look around first... I'll join

you later.

ETTORE

Say, I hope it's understood that starting

tomorrow morning, I'll need to have you around.

If you don't give me some figures to work with,

how can I proceed?

CLAUDIA

Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?

PATRIZIA

I imagine he must be inside sleeping.

CLAUDIA

Would you please see if Sandro is with him?

He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.

PATRIZIA

Ettore...

ETTORE

What is it?

PATRIZIA

Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking

for Sandro.

ETTORE

And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask

Claudia.

PATRIZIA

Yes, yes, of course.

CLAUDIA

Patrizia, I'm afraid.

PATRIZIA

More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at

night.

CLAUDIA

I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel

she's back, and that they're together.

PATRIZIA

But what's gotten into you?... We would have

known. Sandro must be out in the garden

somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or

watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely

surprise indeed if he turned out to be the

sentimental type.

PATRIZIA

Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let

yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to

your room and get back into bed.

CLAUDIA

Just several days ago, the thought of Anna

being dead would have made me sick. And now, I

don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive.

Everything is becoming so damned simple and

easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and

suffering.

PATRIZIA

You should never wish to get melodramatic over

anything.

CLAUDIA

Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being

like that.
