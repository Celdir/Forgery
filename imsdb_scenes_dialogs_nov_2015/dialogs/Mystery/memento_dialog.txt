So where are you?

LEONARD (cont'd)

You're in some motel room.

LEONARD

Looks like somebody's home.

TEDDY

That thing's been here for years.

LEONARD

I think you're wrong. These tracks aren't	*

more than a few days old.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Let's take a look inside.

(CONTINUED)

LEONARD (V.0.)			*

I've finally found him. How long have I		*

been looking?					*

TEDDY

Find anything? Didn't think so, let's go,

yeah?

TEDDY (cont'd)

Fuck this.

LEONARD

YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID! YOU BEG

FORGIVENESS, THEN YOU PAY!

TEDDY

You don't have a clue, you freak.

LEONARD

Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's

forgiveness before I blow your brains

out!

TEDDY

Leonard, you don't have a clue what's

going on. You don't even know my name.

LEONARD

(triumphant smile)

Teddy!

(CONTINUED)

3A.

TEDDY

You read it off your fucking photo. You

don't know me, you don't even know who

you are.

(CONTINUED)

LEONARD

I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San

Francisco and I'm -

TEDDY

(bloody grin)

That's who you were, you don't know who

you are.

LEONARD

Shut your mouth!

TEDDY

Lemme take you down in the basement and

show you what you've become.

TEDDY (cont'd)

(intimate)

C'mon, Lenny - we'll take a look down

there together. Then you'll know. You'll

know what you really are.

CUT TO:

LEONARD (V.O.)

So you're in some motel room...

LEONARD (cont'd)

... you don't know how long you've been

there, or how you got there...

(CONTINUED)

5.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Just some anonymous motel room. Won't

tell you anything. Nothing in the

drawers, but you look anyway.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Nothing except the Gideon Bible.

CUT TO:

BURT

That guy's here already.

TEDDY

Lenny!

LEONARD

It's Leonard... like I told you before.

TEDDY

Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *

LEONARD

(smiles)

I guess I've told you about my condition.

TEDDY

Only every time I see ya!

LEONARD

My car.

TEDDY

This is your car.

LEONARD

(shakes head)

You're in a playful mood.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Shouldn't make fun of somebody's				  *

handicap.

TEDDY

Just trying to have a little fun.

TEDDY

Roll your window up, will ya?

LEONARD

It's broken.

TEDDY

I can get that fixed for you.

TEDDY (cont'd)

So where are we going, Sherlock?

(CONTINUED)

LEONARD

I got a lead on a place.

TEDDY

(surprised at the note)

What the hell you want to go there for?

LEONARD

You know it?

TEDDY

Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    *

Why are we going there?

LEONARD

(smiling)

I don't remember.

LEONARD

Looks like somebody's home.

LEONARD (V.0.)

Nothing except the Gideon Bible.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Sammy Jankis had the same problem. He			  *

tried writing himself notes. Lots of			   *

notes. But he'd get confused.

CUT TO:

BURT

Hiya.

LEONARD

I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.

BURT

What can I do for you, Leonard?

LEONARD

I'm sorry... um... ?

BURT

Burt.

LEONARD

Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked

you to hold my calls -

(CONTINUED)

9.

BURT

You don't know?

LEONARD

I think I may have. I'm not good on the

phone.

BURT

(nods)

You said you like to look people in the

eye when you talk to them. Don't you

remember?

LEONARD

That's the thing. I have this condition.

BURT

Condition?

LEONARD

I have no memory.

BURT

Amnesia?

LEONARD

No. It's different. I have no short-term

memory. I know who I am and all about

myself, but since my injury I can't make

any new memories. Everything fades. If we

talk for too long, I'll forget how we

started. I don't know if we've ever met

before, and the next time I see you I

won't remember this conversation. So if I

seem strange or rude, that's probably...

LEONARD (cont'd)

I've told you this before, haven't I?

BURT

(nods)

I don't mean to mess with you. It's just

so weird. You don't remember me at all,

and we talked a bunch of times.

BURT (cont'd)

What's the last thing you remember?

(CONTINUED)

10.

LEONARD

My wife.

BURT

(fascinated)

What's it like?

LEONARD

Like waking. Like you always just woke

up.							 *

BURT

That must suck. All... backwards.				 *

BURT (cont'd)						 *

Well, like.. you gotta pretty good idea			*

of what you're gonna do next, but no idea		   *

what you just did.							 *

(chuckles)							*

I'm the exact opposite.						 *

LEONARD

(focuses on Burt)

How long have I been here?

BURT

Couple days.

LEONARD

So you're holding my calls?

BURT

As requested.

LEONARD

Okay, but this guy's an exception.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Know this guy?

BURT

Your friend, right?

(CONTINUED)

10A.

LEONARD

What makes you think he's my friend?

BURT

Seen you together, that's all.

LEONARD

He's not my friend, Burt. But if he

calls, or if he turns up here, then you

give me a call in my room, okay?

(CONTINUED)

11.

BURT

Sure. But nobody else, right?

LEONARD

Just this guy.

LEONARD (cont'd)

I hope my condition won't be a problem

for you.

BURT

Not if you remember to pay your bill.

BURT (cont'd)

That guy's here already.

WAITER

Sir? You left these at your table.

LEONARD

Thanks. Lincoln Street?

WAITER

You wanna go east on sixth.

Just keep straight, all the way out of

town, then take a right.

13.

LEONARD (V.O.)

This guy told me his name was Teddy.

TEDDY

Yup?

LEONARD

Mr Gammell?

TEDDY

Lenny, is that you?

John Gammell?

TEDDY

Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there,

LEONARD

I'll be waiting.							   *

SG... 13... 7... IU. It's him. It's			    *

actually him.

LEONARD (cont'd)

I found you, you fuck.

16.

LEONARD

Who is this?

(listens)							 *

LEONARD (cont'd)

And we spoke earlier? I don't remember			 *

that.

(listens)

Well, yeah, but it's not amnesia. I			    *

remember everything from before my

injury, I just can't make any new

memories.

(listens)

LEONARD (cont'd)

So I can't remember talking to you. What

did we talk about?

(nods)

Sammy Jankis. Yeah, I guess I tell

people about Sammy to help them

understand. Sammy's story helps me

understand my own situation.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Sammy Jankis wrote himself endless

notes. But he'd get mixed up. I've got a

more graceful solution to the memory

problem. I'm disciplined and organized.

I use habit and routine to make my life

possible. Sammy had no drive. No reason

to make it work.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Me? I gotta reason.

17.

LEONARD

Natalie.

NATALIE

You don't remember me.

LEONARD

(friendly smile)

Sorry, I should have explained. You see,

I have this condition -

NATALIE

You did explain, Lenny.

LEONARD

Please call me Leonard. My wife called me

Lenny.

NATALIE

You told me.

(CONTINUED)

18.

LEONARD

Then I probably told you how much I hated

it. Could you take off your sunglasses?			*

It's just hard for me -						 *

NATALIE

Yeah.

LEONARD

So you have information for me?

NATALIE

Is that what your little note says?

LEONARD

Yes.

NATALIE

Must be tough living life according to a

few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry

list and your grocery list, you'll be

eating your underwear.

NATALIE (cont'd)

But I guess that's why you got those

freaky tattoos.

LEONARD

It is tough. Almost impossible. I'm sorry

I can't remember you. It's not personal.

NATALIE

I'm sorry.

NATALIE (cont'd)

I do have information for you. You gave

me a license plate number? I had my

friend at the DMV trace it. Guess what name came up.

(CONTINUED)

18A.

NATALIE (cont'd)

John Edward Gamme11. John G.

(CONTINUED)

19.

LEONARD

You know him?

NATALIE

No. But the photo on his license looked

familiar. I think he's been in the bar before

NATALIE (cont'd)

This is a copy of his registration,

license, photo and all. Are you sure you

want this?

LEONARD

Have I told you what this man did?				*

NATALIE

Yes.

LEONARD

Then you shouldn't have to ask.

NATALIE

But even if you get your revenge, you

won't remember it. You won't even know

it's happened.

LEONARD

(annoyed)							 *

So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  *

(calms)							   *

The world doesn't disappear when you			   *

close your eyes, does it? My actions			   *

still have meaning, even if I can't			    *

remember them. My wife deserves				   *

vengeance, and it doesn't make any				*

difference whether I know about it.			    *

NATALIE

Tell me about her again.

LEONARD

Why?

NATALIE

Because you like to remember her. I want

to see you enjoy yourself.

LEONARD

She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*

(CONTINUED)

20.

NATALIE

Don't just recite the words. Close your

eyes, remember her.

LEONARD (V.O.)

You can only feel details. Bits and

pieces which you didn't bother to put

into words. And extreme moments you feel

even if you don't want to. Put it

together and you get the feel of the

person, enough to know how much you miss

them, and how much you hate the person

who took them away.

NATALIE

I wrote an address in there, too. Might

be useful. It's this abandoned place

outside of town. I guy I know used to use

it for his bigger deals.

LEONARD

Deals?

NATALIE

It's isolated.

LEONARD

Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?

NATALIE

I wasn't helping you for money.

LEONARD

Sorry.

(CONTINUED)

21.

NATALIE

It's not your fault. See, you have this

condition...

NATALIE (cont'd)

Are you still at the Discount Inn? Room			*

304? You left this at my place.

LEONARD

The Discount Inn, yeah.						 *

NATALIE

They treating you alright?

LEONARD

(smiling)

Don't remember.

NATALIE

You know what we have in common?

NATALIE (cont'd)

We're both survivors. Take care, Leonard.

(CONTINUED)

22.

LEONARD

I met Sammy through work.

(listens)

Insurance. I was an investigator. I'd			  *

investigate claims to see which ones			   *

were phony.							   *

LEONARD (cont'd)

I had to see through people's bullshit.

It was useful experience, because now

it's my life. When I meet someone, I

don't even know if I've met them before.

I have to look in their eyes and just

figure them out. My job taught me that

the best way to find out what someone

knew was to let them talk.

LEONARD(V.0.)

Throw in the occasional "why?" but just

listen. And watch the eyes, the body			    *

language.

LEONARD (V.0.) (cont'd)

It's complicated. You might catch a sign

but attach the wrong meaning to it. If

someone touches their nose while they're

talking, experts will tell you it means

they're lying. It really means they're

nervous, and people get nervous for all

sorts of reasons. It's all about context.

23.

LEONARD (cont'd)

I was good. Sammy was my first real

challenge.

LEONARD

I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here,

But I've misplaced my key.

BURT

(looks up)

Hi, Leonard.

BURT (cont'd)

Probably in the room.

LEONARD

I don't see my key.

BURT

Shit. Wrong room.

LEONARD

What?

(CONTINUED)

24.

BURT

This isn't your room. You're in 304. I

Fucked up.

LEONARD

This isn't my room?

BURT

No, let's go.

LEONARD

Then why is this my handwriting?

LEONARD (cont'd)

Better tell me what the fuck's going on.

BURT

This was your room. You're up in 304 now.

LEONARD

When was I in here?

BURT

Last week. Then I rented you another one

On top of this.

LEONARD

Why?

BURT

Business is slow. I told my boss about

You, about your condition. He told me to

Try and rent you another room.

LEONARD

Why didn't you clean it out?					 *

BURT

(shrugs)

You're still paying for it. It's still

Your room.

(CONTINUED)

25.

LEONARD

So how many rooms am I checked into in

this dump?

BURT

Just two. So far.							  *

LEONARD

Well, at least you're being honest about

cheating me.

BURT

Yeah, well you're not gonna remember,

anyway.

LEONARD

You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

BURT

Leonard.

BURT (cont'd)

Always get a receipt.

LEONARD

I'm gonna write that down.

LEONARD (cont'd)

What time is it?

26.

CUT TO:

LEONARD

I'd just become an investigator when I

came across Sammy. Mr Samuel R. Jankis -

strangest case ever. Guy's 58, semi-

retired accountant. He and his wife had

been in this car accident... nothing too

serious, but he's acting funny - he

can't get a handle on what's going on.

LEONARD(V.O.)

The doctors find some possible damaqe to

the hippocampus, nothing conclusive. But

Sammy can't remember anything for more

than a couple minutes. He can't work,

can't do shit, medical bills pile up,

his wife calls the insurance company and

I get sent in.

LEONARD (V.0.)

My first big claims investigation - I

really check into it. Sammy can think

just fine, but he can't make any new

memories, he can only remember things

for a few minutes.

(CONTINUED)

27.

LEONARD (V.0.) (CONT'D)

He'd watch T.V., but anything longer than

a couple of minutes was too confusing,

he couldn't remember how it began. He

liked commercials. They were short.

*

LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd)

The crazy part was that this guy who

couldn't follow the plot of "Green

Acres" could do the most complicated

things as long as he had learned them

before the accident...

LEONARD (V.0.) (CONT'D)

... and as long as he kept his mind on

what he was doing.

MRS JANKIS						    *

Gentle.							  *

LEONARD (V.0.)

The doctors assure me that there's a

real condition called Korsokoff's

syndrome; short-term memory loss, rare

but legit. But every time I see him I

catch a look of recognition. Just a

slight look, but he says he can't

remember me at all.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

27A.

LEONARD (cont'd)

I can read people and I'm thinking bad			 *

actor. Now I'm suspicious and I order

more tests.

28.

LEONARD

His wife has to do everything. Sammy can

only do simple stuff. He couldn't pick

up any new skills at all, and that's how

I got him.

TEDDY

Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good.

What brings you back?

LEONARD

Unfinished business. What made you think

I wasn't coming back?

TEDDY

You said you were leaving town.

LEONARD

Things change.

TEDDY

So I see. It's good to see you. My name's

Teddy.

LEONARD

Guess I've told you about my condition.

TEDDY

(grins)

Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll

buy you lunch.

TEDDY

Not hungry?

(CONTINUED)

29.

LEONARD

(shrugs)

It's my condition. I never know if I've

already eaten, so I always just eat small

amounts.

TEDDY

You don't have to remember to be hungry.

LEONARD

It's weird, but if you don't eat for a

while then your body stops being hungry.

You get sort of shaky but you don't

realize you haven't eaten. Have I told

you about Sammy Jankis?

TEDDY

Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him.

Tell me about John G. You still think

he's here, right?

LEONARD

Who?

TEDDY

The guy you're looking for, Johnny G.

That's why you haven't left. Am I right?

TEDDY (cont'd)

Leonard, you need to be very careful.

LEONARD

Why?

TEDDY

Well, the other day you made it sound

like you thought somebody might be trying

to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong

guy.

LEONARD

Yeah, well I go on facts, not

recommendations, okay?

TEDDY

Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to

your little notes and pictures.

LEONARD

Why?

(CONTINUED)

30.

TEDDY

Because you're relying on them alone. You

Don't remember what you've discovered or

how. Your notes might be unreliable.

LEONARD

Memory's unreliable.

LEONARD (cont'd)

No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's

not even that good. Ask the police,

eyewitness testimony is unreliable. The

cops don't catch a killer by sitting

around remembering stuff. They collect

facts, make notes, draw conclusions.

Facts, not memories: that's how you

investigate. I know, it's what I used to

do. Memory can change the shape of a room

or the color of a car. It's an

interpretation, not a record. Memories

can be changed or distorted and they're

irrelevant if you have the facts.

TEDDY

You really want to find this guy?

LEONARD

He took away the woman I love and he took

away my memory. He destroyed everything;

my life and my ability to live.

TEDDY

You're living.

LEONARD

Just for revenge. That's what keeps me

going. It's all I have.

TEDDY

We'll find him. Where are you staying?

LEONARD

Discount Inn. Don't know what room;

haven't got my key.

TEDDY

Probably left it in your room.

31.

LEONARD

I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here,

but I've misplaced my key.

BURT

(looks up)

Hi, Leonard.

LEONARD

So Sammy can't learn any new skills. But

I find something in my research:

Conditioning. Sammy should still be able

to learn through repetition. It's how

you learn stuff like riding a bike,

things you don't think about, you just

get better through practice. Call it

muscle memory, whatever, but it's a

completely different part of the brain

from the short-term memory. So I have

the doctors test Sammy's response to

conditioning...

DOCTOR

Just pick up any three objects.

SAMMY

(amused)

That's a test? Where were you guys when

I did my CPA?

(CONTINUED)

32.

SAMMY (cont'd)

Ah! What the fuck?!

DOCTOR

It's a test, Sammy.

LEONARD (V.O.)

Some of the objects were electrified,

They'd give him a small shock.

LEONARD

They kept repeating the test, always

with the same objects electrified. The

point was to see if he could learn to

avoid the electrified objects. Not by

memory, but by instinct.

LEONARD

Sorry. It's only me.

NATALIE

Sleep okay?

LEONARD

Yeah. You?

(CONTINUED)

33.

NATALIE

I gotta be someplace.

NATALIE (cont'd)

Pretty weird.

LEONARD

Useful. You never write a phone number on

your hand?

NATALIE							  *

(through mirror)						    *

I should be able to talk to my friend			  *

about the license plate today.				    *

LEONARD							  *

Yeah, the license plate...					   *

NATALIE							  *

(smiles)							  *

John G's license plate number. You have			*

it tattooed on your thigh.					   *

(CONTINUED)

33A.

NATALIE

If it's registered in this state it'll			 *

just take seconds to pull up his license

and registration. I'll call when I've

spoken to him.

LEONARD							 *

Why don't we just arrange a meeting now?		    *

I'm not too good on the phone.

(CONTINUED)

34.

LEONARD (cont'd)

(leading)

It's great that you would... that you're

helping me like this...

NATALIE

(smiles)

I'm helping you because you helped me.

NATALIE (cont'd)

So will you remember me next time you seo

me?

NATALIE (cont'd)

I think you will.

LEONARD

(smiles)

I'm sorry.

NATALIE

(amused)

Lenny, before you go, can I have my shirt

back please?

TEDDY

Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good.

What brings you back?

(CONTINUED)

35.

LEONARD

They kept testing Sammy for months,

always with the same objects carrying

the electrical charge...

SAMMY

Ah! What the fuck?!

DOCTOR

It's a test, Sammy.

JUMP CUT TO:

SAMMY

Ah! What the fuck?!

DOCTOR

It's a test, Sammy.

SAMMY

Yeah? Test this you fucking quack.

LEONARD (V.O.)

Even with total short-term memory loss,

Sammy should've learned to instinctively

stop picking up the wrong objects. All

previous cases of short-term memory loss

had responded to conditioning in some

way. Sammy didn't respond at all.

LEONARD

It was enough to suggest his condition

was psychological not physical.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

36.

LEONARD (cont'd)

We turned down his claim on the grounds

that he wasn't covered for mental

illness. Sammy's wife got stuck with the

bills and I got a promotion for

rejecting a big claim.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so

he became helpless. But it works for me.

I live the way Sammy couldn't. Habit and

Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

LEONARD

Natalie, right?

LEONARD (cont'd)

Who the fuck is Dodd?

NATALIE

Guess I don't have to worry about him

anymore.

LEONARD

(snaps)

Who is he? What have you got me into?

NATALIE

Come inside.

(CONTINUED)

37.

NATALIE

Calm down. You're not into anything. It

was my problem, you offered no help. It's

got nothing to do with your

investigation.

LEONARD

That's the problem! How can I find John

G. when I don't know what's going on?!

How did you get me into this?!

NATALIE

Leonard, you offered to help when you saw

what this guy did to me.

LEONARD

How do I know he did that to you?

NATALIE

I came to you straight after he did it. I

showed you what he'd done and asked for

your help.

LEONARD

So I just take your word?

NATALIE

Yes.

LEONARD

(sighs)

Something feels wrong. I think someone's

fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill

the wrong guy.

NATALIE

Did you?

LEONARD

What?

NATALIE

Kill him.

LEONARD

Course not.

(CONTINUED)

38.

NATALIE

This has nothing to do with you. You

helped me out, and I'm grateful.

LEONARD

You have to burn them.

NATALIE

You decided to help me. Trust yourself.

Trust your own judgment. You can

question everything, you can never know

anything for sure.

LEONARD

There are things you know for sure.

NATALIE

Such as?

LEONARD

I know the feel of the world.

(reaches forward)

I know how this wood will sound when I

knock.

(raps knuckles on coffee table)

I know how this glass will feel when I

pick it up.

(handles glass)

Certainties. You think it's knowledge,

but it's a kind of memory, a kind you

take for granted. I can remember so much.

(runs hands over objects)

I know the feel of the world,

(beat)

and I know her.

NATALIE

Your wife?

LEONARD

She's gone and the present is trivia,

which I can scribble down as notes.

NATALIE

Relax a little, okay? Take off your

jacket.

LEONARD

It's not easy to be calm when -

NATALIE

wake up every morning thinking she's

still here then realizing that she's not.

I want time to pass, but it won't. How			 *

can I heal if I can't feel time?

LEONARD

Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of

supporting him and fighting the

company's decision - but it wasn't the

money that got to her.

LEONARD (V.0.)

I never said that Sammy was faking. Just

that his problem was mental, not

physical. But she... she couldn't

understand. She looks into his eyes and

sees the same person. And if it's not a

physical problem...

LEONARD (V.0.) (CONT'D)

... he should just... snap out of it.

(CONTINUED)

43.

LEONARD (cont'd)

So good old Leonard Shelby from the

insurance company gives her the seed of

doubt, just like he gave it to the

doctors. But I never said that Sammy was

faking. I never said that.

- NIGHT >

LEONARD (V.0.)

Awake.

LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd)

Where am I?

LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd)

Motel room.

LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd)

Some anonymous motel room. Nothing in the

drawers, but you look anyway.

Teddy!

TEDDY

Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

(CONTINUED)

45.

TEDDY (cont'd)

I get it - amorous neighbors.

LEONARD

Why are you here?

TEDDY

(surprised)

You called me. You wanted my help. You

know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding

friendships than this one. Although I do

get to keep using the same jokes.

TEDDY (cont'd)

Who the fuck is that?

LEONARD

You don't know him?

TEDDY

No! Should I?

TEDDY (cont'd)

Is this John G.?

LEONARD

I don't think so.

TEDDY

Think so? You don't know? Didn't you

write it down?

LEONARD

I might have fallen asleep before I did.

TEDDY

Ask him.

LEONARD

What's your name?

(CONTINUED)

46.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Your name.

MAN

Dodd.

LEONARD

Who did this to you?

DODD

(confused)

What?

LEONARD

Who did this to you?

DODD

You did.

TEDDY

I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if

that's what -

LEONARD

No. No, just let me think for a minute.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Here we go.

TEDDY

Natalie? Natalie who?

LEONARD

Why?

(CONTINUED)

47.

TEDDY

I think I know her.

LEONARD

We've got to get him out of here.

TEDDY

He's got to have a car, right? We just

take him back to his car and tell him to

get the fuck out of town before we kill

him.

LEONARD

We can't just walk him out tied up and

bleeding.

TEDDY

How'd ya get him in here in the first

place?

LEONARD

I don't know.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Yes I do... this isn't my room.

LEONARD (cont'd)

It's his. He was already here. Let's just		   *

go.							 *

TEDDY							    *

Wait, we can't just leave him. The maid			*

finds him, calls the cops. He's seen us now		 *

LEONARD							  *

Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   *

march him out with a gun in his back.			  *

TEDDY

Why would I have a gun?

(CONTINUED)

47A.

LEONARD

It must be his. I don't think they'd let

someone like me carry a gun.

TEDDY

Fucking hope not.

48.

LEONARD

Which one?

TEDDY

We probably ought to take his car, you

know, teach him a lesson.

LEONARD

Shut it, Teddy.

TEDDY

Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.

LEONARD

I'll ride with him. You follow.

TEDDY

Give me your keys.

LEONARD

Take your own car.

TEDDY

So was he scared?

LEONARD

Yeah. I think it was your sinister

mustache that got him.

(CONTINUED)

49.

TEDDY

Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.

LEONARD

What's wrong with this one?

TEDDY

You like it? Let's trade.

TEDDY

So what are you gonna do now?

LEONARD

I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that

was all about.

TEDDY

Natalie who?

LEONARD

Natalie, right?

LEONARD (cont'd)

Who the fuck is Dodd?

What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was

that you can't bully someone into

under, the harder it gets.

Don't feel drunk.

Ah, it's a message for Teddy...				   *

LEONARD (cont'd)

LEONARD'S WIFE

(without looking up)

It's good.

LEONARD

You've read it a hundred times.

LEONARD'S WIFE

I enjoy it.

LEONARD

Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in

wanting to know what happens next -

LEONARD'S WIFE

(looks up, annoyed)

Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to

annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read,

please.

LEONARD (V.O.)

Probably tried this before. Probably

burned truckloads of your stuff. Can't

remember to forget you.

DISSOLVE TO:

LEONARD (V.O.)

Do I know this guy?

LEONARD (V.O.)

He seems to know me.

LEONARD (V.O.)

What the fuck!

DODD

I like your car.

LEONARD

Thanks.

DODD

Where'd you get it?

LEONARD

Interested in buying one?

DODD

I just want you to tell me how you came

by that car.

LEONARD

I forget.

DODD

I haven't made a strong enough impression

Are you okay in there?!

BLONDE

Was it good for you?

(CONTINUED)

61.

BLONDE (cont'd)

Shit. Was I supposed to lock the door?

LEONARD

No. That would have been worse.

LEONARD (cont'd)

I'd like you to leave now.

CUT TO:

LEONARD

Well, sir, that would certainly be in

keeping with some of my own discoveries.

Yeah, I was hoping to get more on the

drugs angle. Hang on a second.

LEONARD (cont'd)

The police report mentioned the drugs

found in the car outside my house. The

car was stolen, but his prints were all

over it, along with some of his stuff.

And I think there's something...

(flips through pages)

Something about a syringe...

(flips pages, confused)

I've got a copy of the police report.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

61A.

LEONARD (cont'd)

It has lots of information, but with my

condition, it's tough. I can't really

keep it all in mind at once.

(CONTINUED)

62.

LEONARD (cont'd)					   *

I have to keep summarizing the different		    *

sections...							   *

LEONARD (cont'd)

Yeah, and there's pages missing... I

guess I've been trying to log them all.

(listens, smiles)

The police gave me the report

themselves. I dealt with them a lot in

my insurance job, and I had friends in

the department. They must have figured

that if I saw the facts of the case,

then I would stop believing that we

needed to find John G.

LEONARD (cont'd)

They weren't even looking for John G.

The stuff they found in the car just fit

in with what they believed had happened,

so they didn't chase any of it up.

(CONTINUED)

62A.

(CONTINUED)

63.

LEONARD

None? Okay, blonde. Yeah, blonde is fine.

Discount Inn, 304. Leonard.					  *

BLONDE

Well, what then?

LEONARD

It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.

LEONARD (cont'd)

No, you just go into the bathroom. We go

to bed, you wait till I fall asleep, then

you go into the bathroom and slam the door.

BLONDE

Slam it?

LEONARD

Just loud enough to wake me up.

BLONDE

That's it?

LEONARD

That's it.

LEONARD (cont'd)

But, first I need you to put these things

around.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Just pretend these things are yours, and

this is your bedroom.

(CONTINUED)

64.

BLONDE

Should I wear it?

LEONARD

No. Just leave the stuff lying around as

if it were yours. Like you just took it

off or something.

BLONDE

Whatever gets you off.

LEONARD

No! No, don't use it, you, I mean it's...

you just have to put it where you would

if it were yours.

LEONARD

The drugs stashed in the car doesn't

ring true for me.

LEONARD (cont'd)

The police figure the guy was an addict

needing money to score, but I'm not

convinced. He's not gonna be breaking in

when he's still got a stash that big.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

65.

LEONARD (cont'd)

(listens)

I think John G. left it or planted it.

(listens)

Well, it was a lot for one guy's

personal use.

(listens)

How do you know that?

(listens, checks report)

Right, that's true. It fits.

(listens)

Too much for personal use, so he deals.

TEDDY (O.S.)

You should lock a car as nice as this.

LEONARD

Who the fuck are you?

TEDDY

(gasping)

Teddy. Your buddy.

LEONARD

Prove it.

TEDDY

(gasping)

Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about

Sammy.

LEONARD

What are you doing in my car?

(CONTINUED)

66.

TEDDY

Sense of humour went with the memory,

huh? You know why you're still here,

don't you?

LEONARD

Unfinished business.

TEDDY

Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you.

Your business here is very much finished.

You're still here because of Natalie.

LEONARD

Who's she?

TEDDY

Whose house do you think you just walked

out of?

TEDDY (cont'd)

Take a look at your pictures, I bet you

got one of her.

TEDDY (cont'd)

Great shot, Lenny.

TEDDY (cont'd)

You wanna make a note that you can't

trust her.

LEONARD

Why's that?

TEDDY

Because she'll have taken one look at

your clothes and your car and started

thinking of ways to turn the situation to

her advantage. She's already got you

staying with her, for fuck's sake.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

67.

TEDDY (cont'd)

You can't stay with her. Let me give you

the name of a motel.

TEDDY (cont'd)

Good thing I found you. She's bad news.

LEONARD

What do you mean "bad news"?

TEDDY

She's involved with these drug dealers.

TEDDY (cont'd)

See these? That's the bar where she

works. Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

She'd take orders for him, arrange meets.

He'd write messages on these, then leave

it on the bar. She'd drop replies when

she served him drinks.

LEONARD

Why should I care?

TEDDY

She's gonna use you. To protect herself.

LEONARD

From who?

TEDDY

Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll

want to know what happened to her

boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody

pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.

LEONARD

Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is

that it? You worried she'll use me

against you?

TEDDY

She couldn't.

LEONARD

Why not?

(CONTINUED)

68.

TEDDY

(grins)

She has no idea who I am.

LEONARD

Why are you following me?

TEDDY

I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get

her claws into you. She doesn't know

anything about your investigation, so

when she offers to help you, it'll be for

her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not

go back to her. Take out a pen, write

yourself a note, do not trust her.

LEONARD

Happy now?

TEDDY

I won't be happy until you leave town.

LEONARD

Why?

TEDDY

How long do you think you can hang around

here before people start asking

questions?

LEONARD

What sort of questions?

TEDDY

The sort of questions you should be

asking yourself.

LEONARD

Like what?

TEDDY

Like how'd you get this car? That suit?

LEONARD

I have money.

(CONTINUED)

69.

TEDDY

From what?

LEONARD

My wife's death. I used to work in

Insurance, we were well covered.

TEDDY

So in your grief you wandered into a

Jaguar dealership?

TEDDY (cont'd)

You haven't got a clue, have you? You

don't even know who you are?

LEONARD

Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I

remember everything about myself up until

the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm

from San Fran -

TEDDY

That's who you were, Lenny. You don't

know who you are, who you've become since

the incident. You're wandering around,

playing detective... and you don't even

know how long ago it was.

TEDDY (cont'd)

Put it this way. Were you wearing

designer suits when you sold insurance?			*

LEONARD

I didn't sell -

TEDDY

I know, you investigated. Maybe you need

to apply some of your investigative

skills to yourself.

LEONARD

Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.

TEDDY

Don't go back in there. There's a motel

out of town.

(CONTINUED)

70.

TEDDY (cont'd)

It's been fun, Lenny.

LEONARD

Fuck it. I need my own place.

LEONARD

I can't blame the cops for not taking me

seriously. This is a difficult condition

for people to understand. I mean look at

Sammy Jankis. His own wife couldn't deal

with it.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

71.

LEONARD (cont'd)

(listens)

I told you about how she tried to get

him to snap out of it?

(listens)

It got much worse than that. Eventually

Sammy's wife came to see me at the

office, and I found out all kinds of

shit.

(listens)

She knew that I was the one who had

built he case for Sammy faking it.

LEONARD (V.O.)

She told me about life with Sammy, how

she'd treated him. It had got to the

point where she'd get Sammy to hide food

all around the house, then stop feeding

him to see if his hunger would make him

remember where he'd hidden the stuff.

She wasn't a cruel person, she just

wanted her old Sammy back.

MRS. JANKIS

Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and

you decided that he was faking -

LEONARD

Mrs. Jankis, the company's position

isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything,

just that his condition can't be shown -

MRS. JANKIS

I'm not interested in the company

position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know

your honest opinion about Sammy.

LEONARD

We shouldn't even be talking this way

while the case is still open to appeal.

MRS. JANKIS

I'm not appealing the decision.

LEONARD

Then why are you here?

(CONTINUED)

72.

MRS. JANKIS

Mr. Shelby, try and understand. When I

look into Sammy's eyes, I don't see some

vegetable, I see the same old Sammy.

What do you think it's like for me to

suspect that he's imagining this whole			 *

problem? That if I could just say the

right thing he'd snap out of it and be

back to normal? If I knew that my old

Sammy was truly gone, then I could say

goodbye and start loving this new Sammy.		    *

As long as I have doubt, I can't say

goodbye and move on.

LEONARD

Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?

MRS. JANKIS

I want you to forget the company you

work for for thirty seconds, and tell me

if you really think that Sammy is faking

his condition.

MRS. JANKIS (cont'd)

I need to know what you honestly

believe.

LEONARD

(looks at Mrs. Jankis)

I believe that Sammy should be

physically capable of making new

memories.

MRS. JANKIS

Thank you.

LEONARD

She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd

helped her.

LEONARD (cont'd)

I thought she just needed some kind of

answer.

I didn't think it was important to her

what the answer was, just that she had

one to believe.

I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   *

Dodd and I said that I didn't have				*

Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this

Teddy must have taken everything.

LEONARD

And what did he say?

NATALIE

He didn't believe me. He said that if I

don't get him the money tomorrow he's

gonna kill me. Then he started hitting

me.

LEONARD

Where is he?

NATALIE

What are you gonna do?

LEONARD

I'll go see him.

NATALIE

NATALIE

Yeah?

LEONARD

Yeah, I hated it.

NATALIE

This guy's dangerous, let's think of

something else.

LEONARD

I'll take care of it. Just tell me what

he looks like, and where I can find him.

Do you have a pen?

NATALIE

He'll probably find you.

LEONARD

Me? Why would he be interested in me?

NATALIE

I told him about your car.

LEONARD

Why would you do that?

his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks

I took it.

LEONARD

Did you?

NATALIE

No!

What's this all about?

NATALIE

You don't know, do you? You're blissfully

ignorant, aren't you?

NATALIE

I know about your fucking condition,

Leonard! I probably know more about it

than you do! You don't have a fucking

clue about anything else!

LEONARD

What happened?

NATALIE

What happened is that Jimmy went to meet

a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of

money with him and he didn't come back.

Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I

don't know whether you know this Teddy or

how well -

LEONARD

Neither do I.

NATALIE

Don't protect him.

LEONARD

I'm not.

NATALIE

Help me.

LEONARD

How?

NATALIE

Get rid of Dodd for me.

LEONARD

What?

NATALIE

Kill him. I'll pay you.

What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna

kill someone for money.

What then? Love? What would you kill for?

For your wife, right?

That's different.

NATALIE

Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to

tell you that your wife was a fucking

whore and we can still be friends!

Calm down.

NATALIE

That's easy for you to say! You can't get

scared, you don't remember how, you

fucking idiot!

Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.

Maybe it is! How the fuck would you

know?! You don't know a fucking thing!

You can't get scared, can you get angry?!

Yes.

You pathetic piece of shit. I can say

whatever the fuck I want and you won't

have a clue, you fucking retard.

No pens here, I'm afraid. You're never

going to know that I called you a retard,

LEONARD

Don't say another fucking word!

NATALIE

About your whore of a wife?

NATALIE (cont'd)

I read about your problem. You know what

one of the causes of short term memory

loss is?

NATALIE (cont'd)

Venereal disease. Maybe your cunt of a

wife sucked one too many diseased cocks

and turned you into a retard.

You sad freak, you won't remember any of

the police didn't believe me.

NATALIE

How did they explain what you remembered?

The gun and stuff?

LEONARD

(points at conclusions on back				*

of file)							 *

John G. was clever. He took the dead

man's gun and replaced it with the sap

that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and

left the getaway car. He gave the police

a complete package. They found a sap with

my blood on it in the dead man's hand,

and they only found my gun. They didn't

need to look for anyone else. I was the

only guy who disagreed with the facts,

and I had brain damage.						 *

You can stay here for a couple of days if

it'll help.

Thank you.

BURT

Yeah, but there's a call for you from

this guy. He's a cop.

LEONARD

A cop?

BURT

And he says you're gonna wanna hear what

he's got to say.							   *

LEONARD

(shakes head)							  *

I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    *

look people in the eye when I talk to			  *

them.							    *

CUT TO:

NATALIE

On the house.

LEONARD

Thanks.

NATALIE

You really do have a problem. Just like

that cop said.

Your condition, I mean.

LEONARD

(shrugs)

Nobody's perfect.

NATALIE

What's the last thing you remember?

Leonard looks at her.

LEONARD

My wife.

NATALIE

Sweet.

LEONARD

Dying.

NATALIE

What?

LEONARD

I remember my wife dying.

NATALIE

Let me get you a fresh glass. I think

this one was dusty.

Beer, please.

NATALIE

What do you want?

LEONARD

A BEER, please.

NATALIE

Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  *

that and order a beer.						  *

LEONARD

There's a dress code?

NATALIE

What are you here for?

LEONARD

I'm meeting someone called Natalie.

NATALIE

Well, that's me.

LEONARD

Oh. But haven't we met before?

LEONARD (cont'd)

So why am I here?

NATALIE

You tell me.

LEONARD

I don't remember. See, I have no short-			*

term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *

(CONTINUED)

NATALIE

You're the memory guy?

LEONARD

How do you know about me?

NATALIE

My boyfriend told me about you.

LEONARD

Who's your boyfriend?

NATALIE

(beat)

Jimmy Grantz. Know him?

NATALIE (cont'd)

Well, it seems like Jimmy knows you. He

told me about you. Said you were staying

over at the Discount. Then, just this			  *

evening, this cop comes in here looking			*

for you. Looking for a guy who couldn't

remember stuff, who'd forget how he got

here or where he was going. I told him we

get a lot of guys like that in here.

LEONARD

Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short

term memory loss.

NATALIE

Are you Teddy?

LEONARD

My name's Leonard.							 *

NATALIE

Did Teddy send you?

LEONARD

I don't know.

NATALIE

What's happened to Jimmy?

(CONTINUED)

91.

LEONARD

I don't know. I'm sorry.

NATALIE

You have no idea where you've just come

from? What you've just done?

LEONARD

I can't make new memories. Everything			  *

fades, nothing sticks. By the time we

finish this conversation I won't remember

how it started, and the next time I see

you I won't know that I've ever met you

before.

NATALIE

So why did you come here?

LEONARD

Found it in my pocket.

NATALIE

(quiet)

Your pocket.

NATALIE (cont'd)

Bar bet.

NATALIE (cont'd)

For a lot of money.

(CONTINUED)

92.

NATALIE (cont'd)

Care to contribute?

NATALIE (cont'd)

Come on, proceeds are going to charity.

NATALIE (cont'd)

On the house.

LEONARD

Thank-you.

LEONARD							  *

What do you want?							  *

(listens)							 *

I know you're a cop, but what do you			   *

want? Did I do something wrong?				   *

(frightened)							   *

No, but I can't remember things I do. I			*

don't know what I just did. Maybe I did			*

something wrong, did I do something			    *

wrong?							   *

LEONARD							  *

I dunno - something bad. Maybe I did			   *

something bad.							*

NATALIE							  *

(casual)							  *

Hey, Jimmy -							  *

NATALIE (cont'd)					   *

I'm sorry, I... I thought you were				*

someone else.							 *

LEONARD							  *

No, Officer, but with my condition, you			*

don't know anything... you feel angry,			 *

guilty, you don't know why. You could do		    *

something terrible and not have the			    *

faintest idea ten minutes later. Like			  *

Sammy. What if I've done something like			*

Sammy?!							  *

(listens)							 *

I didn't tell you? Didn't I tell you			   *

what happened to Sammy and his wife?!			  *

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

93A.

LEONARD (contd)

Mrs. Jankis came to my off ice and asked		    *

my honest opinion about Sammy's				   *

condition.							    *

LEONARD (V.0.)

I never said he was faking. Just that

his condition was mental, not physical.

She seemed satisfied, she just said

"thanks" and got up to leave. I found

out later that she went home and gave

Sammy his final exam.

MRS. JANKIS

Sammy, it's time for my shot.

(CONTINUED)

94.

LEONARD (V.O.)

She knew beyond doubt that he loved her,

so she found a way to test him.

MRS. JANKIS

Sammy, it's time for my shot.

MRS. JANKIS (cont'd)

Sammy, it's time for my shot.

LEONARD (V.O.)

She really thought she would call his

bluff...

LEONARD (V.O.) (cont'd)

... or didn't want to live with the

things she'd put him through.

DISSOLVE TO:

(CONTINUED)

95.

LEONARD (V.0.) (CONT'D)

She went into a coma and never

recovered.

LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd)

Sammy couldn't understand or explain

what had happened.

LEONARD (V.0.)

He's been in a home ever since. He

doesn't even know his wife is dead.

LEONARD (cont'd)					   *

Sammy's brain didn't respond to				   *

conditioning, but he was no con man.			   *

When his wife looked into his eyes she			 *

thought he could be the same as he ever			*

was. When I looked into Sammy's eyes, I			*

thought I saw recognition. We were both			*

wrong.

(CONTINUED)

96.

LEONARD (cont'd)

Now I know. You take it. If you think

you're supposed to recognize someone,

you pretend to. You bluff it to get a

pat on the head from the doctors. You

bluff it to seem less of a freak.				 *

LEONARD

Didn't know this town had a parlor.

TATTOOIST

Every town's got a parlor.

LEONARD

I'd like this on my thigh please.

LEONARD

Promise you won't call me an idiot.

TATTOOIST

(shaking her head)

Idiot.

TEDDY

Hi, Lenny.

TATTOOIST							*

It's private back here.

TEDDY

It's alright, we know each other, right,

Lenny?

LEONARD

How'd you know I was in here?

TEDDY

The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even

Bother to put it around back.

TEDDY (cont'd)

You should have just left town, Lenny.

There's Tattoo parlors up North.

LEONARD

Guess I wanted to get something down

before it slipped my mind.

TEDDY

Gimme the keys, I'll move the car.

(CONTINUED)

98.

LEONARD

It'll be alright for a minute.

TATTOOIST

Wait out there.

TEDDY

Lenny, I'll be back in a minute. I've got

to get you some stuff.

TEDDY

Give us a minute, will ya?

TEDDY (cont'd)

We've got to get you out of here.				 *

LEONARD

Why?

TEDDY

Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about

this. It's not safe f or you to be walking

around like this.

LEONARD

Why not?

(CONTINUED)

99.

TEDDY

Because that cop's looking for you. We			 *

need to get you a change of identity.

Some new clothes and a different car

should do for now. Put these on.				  *

LEONARD							  *

What cop?

TEDDY

This bad cop. He checked you into the			  *

Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    *

for days, sticking envelopes under your			*

door, telling you shit.						 *

LEONARD

Envelopes?							    *

TEDDY

He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    *

he calls you up to bullshit you.				  *

Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			*

he slips something under your door to			  *

frighten you into answering your phone			 *

again. He's been pretending to help you.		    *

Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    *

being some local drug dealer.					*

LEONARD

How do you know this?

TEDDY

'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's

funny. He's laughing at you.

LEONARD

How do you know him?

TEDDY

(glances around)

I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town

looking for information. The local boys

put us in touch.

(CONTINUED)

LEONARD							  *

What did he want to know from you?				*

(CONTINUED)

101.

TEDDY							    *

He wanted to know all, about Jimmy Grantz.

LEONARD

Who?

TEDDY

Jimmy's a drug dealer. This cop wanted to

know all about how he sets up deals, shit

like that. He's got some score in mind			 *

and you're involved. Come on, there's no		    *

time to argue - if he knew I was helping		    *

you he'd find a way to kill me. Just get		    *

these clothes on. You're gonna take my			 *

car and get the fuck out of here.				 *

102.

LEONARD

(under his breath)

Sneaky fuck. "Bad Cop". Had me going.

CUT TO:

LEONARD

So this Jimmy Grantz deals drugs out of			*

the bar where his girlfriend works. But			*

he'll come to the meet alone.					*

(CONTINUED)

102A.

LEONARD (cont'd)					   *

I always figured the drugs angle would			 *

be the best way to get him. No, officer,		    *

I'm ready. Ready as I'll ever be.

You're downstairs now? What do you look

like?

I'll be right down.

Officer Gammell.

LEONARD

Something to remember you by.

LEONARD (cont'd)

I'm sorry - is it Officer, or Lieutenant

Gammell?

TEDDY

Just Teddy. Don't write Gammell please.

TEDDY (cont'd)

I'm undercover. Here's directions. He'll

be heading there now.

JIMMY

You're making a big fucking mistake. My

Don't say anything else.

JIMMY

I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -

LEONARD

Quiet!

LEONARD (cont'd)

Pants, too.

JIMMY

Why?

LEONARD

I don't want blood on them.

JIMMY

(sudden fear)

Wait! Did he tell you what I was

bringing?

LEONARD

Strip!

JIMMY

Look, there's two hundred grand stashed

in the car. Just take it!

LEONARD

You think you can bargain with me?!

JIMMY

Take the money and walk away!

I don't want your fucking money!

What?! What do you want from me?!

I want my fucking life back!

Sammy... remember Sammy...

LEONARD (V.0.)						*

What have I done?							  *

LEONARD

(distraught)

Hey! Mister! I need help!

TEDDY

What's wrong?

LEONARD

There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta

get him to a doctor!

109.

LEONARD

(panicked)

He might have fallen down the stairs, I

don't know, I don't know what's going on,

I'm confused. I have this memory thing -

do I know you?

TEDDY

No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll

be okay. Is he still breathing?

LEONARD

Maybe. Maybe just.

TEDDY

So what were you doing here?

LEONARD

I don't know. See, I have this condition.

TEDDY

Well, I hope it's not as serious as his,

'cos this guy's dead.

TEDDY (cont'd)						*

FUCK, Lenny! That fucking kills!

LEONARD

Remember me again, huh?

LEONARD (cont'd)					   *

You're a cop. A fucking cop.					 *

(CONTINUED)

109A.

TEDDY							    *

Yeah, and I helped you find the guy you			*

were looking for -							 *

LEONARD							  *

Get up.							  *

110.

TEDDY

I think you've got the wrong idea -

LEONARD

Who was that? He's not the guy. He knew			*

me.							 *

TEDDY							    *

Sure he did. He raped your wife and			    *

fucked up your brain.						   *

LEONARD							  *

Bullshit.							*

TEDDY

His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   *

your tattoos.							 *

LEONARD

So what was he bringing the two hundred			*

grand for?							    *

TEDDY							    *

What -							   *

LEONARD							  *

What was it for?							   *

TEDDY

A load of amphetamine I told him I had.

LEONARD

This is a drug deal?!

TEDDY

That, and your thing.						   *

(CONTINUED)

111.

TEDDY (cont'd)						*

Jimmy's your guy, Leonard. I just figured		   *

we'd make some money on the side.				 *

LEONARD							  *

But how did he know me?						 *

TEDDY							    *

The Discount Inn, he deals out of there.		    *

The guy at the front desk lets him know

if anybody comes snooping around. He

called Jimmy as soon as you took a

picture of that dump.						   *

LEONARD

You're using me!

TEDDY

No!

(beat)

You get half.							 *

LEONARD

He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him

about Sammy?							  *

TEDDY

(chuckles)

You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone

who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis,

remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets

better every time you tell it. So you

lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing

wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if

there's a few little things you'd rather

not remember?

LEONARD

What the fuck are you talking about?

(CONTINUED)

112.

TEDDY

(theatrical shrug)

I dunno... your wife surviving the

assault... her not believing about your

condition... the doubt tearing her up

inside.., the insulin -

LEONARD

That's Sammy, not me! I told you about

Sammy -

TEDDY

Like you've told yourself. Over and over.

Conditioning yourself to believe.

"learning through repetition" -

LEONARD

Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy

ended up in an institution - !				    *

TEDDY

Sammy was a con man. A faker.

LEONARD

I never said he was faking! I never said

that!

TEDDY

You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.

(CONTINUED)

113.

LEONARD

I was wrong! That's the whole point!

Sammy's wife came to me and -

TEDDY

Sammy didn't have a wife.

TEDDY (cont'd)

It was your wife who had diabetes.

LEONARD'S WIFE

Gentle.

LEONARD

My wife wasn't diabetic.

TEDDY

Are you sure?

LEONARD'S WIFE

Gentle.

(CONTINUED)

114.

LEONARD

She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 *

know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    *

with you?							*

TEDDY

(shrugs)

I guess I can only make you believe the

things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   *

Jimmy down there.

LEONARD

But he's not the right guy!					  *

TEDDY							    *

He was to you. Come on, Lenny, you got			 *

your revenge - just enjoy it while you			 *

still remember.							    *

(CONTINUED)

115.

TEDDY

(chuckles)

What difference does it make whether he			*

was your guy or not?						    *

LEONARD

It makes all the difference.					 *

TEDDY

Why? You're never going to know.				  *

LEONARD

Yes, I will.

TEDDY

No, you won't.

LEONARD

Somehow, I'll know!

TEDDY

You won't remember!

LEONARD

When it's done, I'll know! It'll be

different!

TEDDY

I thought so too! I was sure you'd				*

remember. But you didn't.					    *

Beat. Leonard looks at Teddy, questioning.

TEDDY

(off look)

You know, when we found your guy and			   *

killed him.

(off look)

That's right, the real John G. Over a			  *

year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  *

already dead.							 *

LEONARD

Why do you keep lying to me?					 *

TEDDY

I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your			*

wife's death. I believed you, I thought			*

you deserved the chance for revenge. I

helped you find the other guy who was in

your bathroom that night. The guy who

cracked your skull and fucked your wife.		    *

We found him and you killed him.				  *

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

115A.

TEDDY (cont'd)

You didn't remember, so I helped you			   *

start looking again, looking for the guy		    *

you already killed.

LEONARD

So who are you saying he was?					*

TEDDY

Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I

stopped asking myself why a long time

ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad

fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 *

strung out to realize that your wife

didn't live alone. When you killed him,			*

I've never seen you so happy - I was

convinced you'd remember. But it didn't

stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like

this won't stick.

TEDDY (cont'd)

That's the picture, right? I took that,

right when you did it. Look how happy you		   *

are. Before you forgot. I wanted to see			*

that face again.

LEONARD							  *

(sarcastic)							    *

Thank you.							    *

TEDDY

Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   *

you were more than happy to help. You lie		   *

to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 *

the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  *

make up your own truth.						 *

(CONTINUED)

116.

TEDDY (cont'd)						*

Look at your police file. It was complete		   *

when I gave it to you. Who took the 12			 *

pages out?							    *

LEONARD

You probably.							 *

TEDDY

No. You took them out.						  *

LEONARD

Why would I do that?						    *

TEDDY

To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever

solve. You know how many towns, how many		    *

guys called James G? Or John G? Shit,

Leonard, I'm a John G.

LEONARD

Your name's Teddy.

TEDDY

(chuckles)

My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward

Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    *

G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			*

I'm the one that has to live with what			 *

you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    *

it all together. You just wander around			*

playing detective. You're living a dream,		   *

kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    *

of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   *

which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			*

in the picture.							    *

LEONARD

I should kill you.							 *

TEDDY

Quit it!							 *

(brushes the gun away)					   *

You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 *

you're so good at it.						   *

(CONTINUED)

TEDDY (cont'd)

Hey, where are you going? You know what			*

LEONARD (V.0.)

I'm not a killer...

LEONARD (V.0.) (CON'T'D)

LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd)

Maybe I'm not finished yet. Maybe I need

to be sure that you won't ever use me

again.

LEONARD (V.0.) (cont'd)

You're a John G.? Fine, then you can be

my John G.

LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd)

Do I lie to myself to be happy?

In your case, Teddy... yes, I will.

Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

LEONARD

It is now.

TEDDY

You can't just take it!

LEONARD

Why not?

(CONTINUED)

118.

TEDDY

You just killed the guy who owned it!

Somebody'll recognize it!

LEONARD

I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy

than a murderer. I'm gonna hang on to

this.

LEONARD (V.O.)

I have to believe in the world outside my

own mind. I have to believe that my

actions still have meaning, even if I

can't remember them. I have to believe

that when my eyes are closed, the world's

still there.

LEONARD (V.O.) (cont'd)

(rising tension)

But do I? Do I believe the world's still

there?

(CONTINUED)

119.

LEONARD (V.O.) (cont'd)

Is it still out there?!

LEONARD (V.O.) (cont'd)

Now... where was I?
