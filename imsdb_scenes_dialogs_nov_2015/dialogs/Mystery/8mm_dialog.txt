CAB DRIVER

Where to?

WELLES

Follow that limousine.  Don't get

too close, don't let it get too far

away.  Just keep with it.

CAB DRIVER

You kidding?

WELLES

Nope.

CAB DRIVER

Uh, listen... you're not supposed to

be smoking in here.  I'm sorry,

that's company policy...

WELLES

How about this... every cigarette I

smoke, I give you five dollars?

CAB DRIVER

Okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good...

OLDER WOMAN

Thank you.

Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

AMY

Welcome home.

WELLES

Do you know how much I missed you?

AMY

What's this... have you been

smoking... ?

WELLES

Smoking?  I'm not smoking.

AMY

Your clothing reeks of it.

WELLES

You know, Amy, I've been sitting

around in bars and everywhere

following this guy... I mean, is

this what I get first thing?  Before

you even "hello," you accuse me... ?

AMY

I'm not accusing you...

WELLES

Well, I'm not smoking, okay?

AMY

Okay, I believe you.

WELLES

We've been all through that.  I've

been on my best behavior.

WELLES

Hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss

me?  I sure missed you...

WELLES

Let's get my bags and get the hell

out of here.

AMY

How's the detective business?

WELLES

Business was fine.  I'll tell you

what, you couldn't pay me enough to

live down there.

AMY

You better not be smoking, that's

all I can say.

WELLES

Honey, I'm not, please...

AMY

I love you.

WELLES

I love you.

WELLES

What's all the trouble, Cinderella?

What are you crying about, huh?

WELLES

Your son-in-law dealt with the dry

cleaning franchise during the day,

saw that woman every night.

(clears his throat)

The specifics are in the report, and

information about the woman.  It's

unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...

POLITICIAN

None too discreet, is he?

WELLES

No, sir, he is not.

POLITICIAN

He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn

my daughter, but what can you do?

WELLES

The um... you'll find my invoice in

the envelope. If that's all...

POLITICIAN

Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.

WELLES

Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever

be of further assistance.

AMY

You think you'll have time for the

water heater this weekend?

WELLES

Sure.  I'll call the guy.

AMY

You're not using the same guy who

tried to fix it?

WELLES

I'm not using him again for

anything.  He was worthless.

(eating)

You have bridge here Saturday?

AMY

Betty's out of town so we're playing

next week.

WELLES

(into PHONE)

Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a

minute...?

WELLES

(shouts upstairs)

Okay, I've got it.

(into phone)

Hello... sorry, I was switching

phones.  It's a pleasure to make

your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian.

(listens)

Yes.  Yes, I understand... tomorrow

evening should be fine...

MRS CHRISTIAN

Mister Welles. You're very prompt.

WELLES

I try to be.

MRS CHRISTIAN

I appreciate your coming on such

short notice.

MRS CHRISTIAN

This is Mister Longdale, my late

husband's attorney.

WELLES

Uh huh, pleasure.

MRS CHRISTIAN

Apparently Mr. Longdale has

something he feels he simply must

say before you and I speak.

LONGDALE

Yes, I do have something to say.  I

insisted on being here as soon as I

heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.

WELLES

I'm listening.

LONGDALE

As Mr. Christian's attorney and one

of the executors of his estate, it

concerns me that a meeting of this

sort should take place without my

being asked to attend.

WELLES

Of what sort?

LONGDALE

You are a private investigator?

WELLES

That's right.

LONGDALE

Well, whatever reasons Mrs.

Christian has for engaging the

services of a private investigator,

I should certainly be a party to.

But, since she feels differently, I

can only go on the record as having

expressed my adamant disapproval.

MRS CHRISTIAN

Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone

on the record, and now perhaps you

should just be gone.

MRS CHRISTIAN

Have a pleasant evening.

(to Welles)

Will you have tea, Mister Welles?

WELLES

Thank you.

WELLES

He's odd.

MRS CHRISTIAN

He's a lawyer.

(offers tea)

Please, sit, here...

MRS CHRISTIAN

I've spoken to friends of mine and

my husband's, in Harrisburg, in

Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about

you.  I must say you have friends in

influential places.

WELLES

I've been privileged to provide

services for people I admire.

MRS CHRISTIAN

You are highly recommended.  Praised

for your discretion... your strict

adherence to confidentiality.

MRS CHRISTIAN

As you know, my husband passed away

recently.  Two weeks ago now.

WELLES

My condolences.

MRS CHRISTIAN

His passing has left me with...

something of a dilemma.  A terrible,

terrible dilemma.

WELLES

I'll do whatever I can to help.

CHRISTIAN STEEL.

"

MRS CHRISTIAN

His inner sanctum.

MRS CHRISTIAN

Not many people have been inside

this room.

WELLES

Pittsburgh?

MRS CHRISTIAN

Mostly.  That's where he started his

empire building.

(looks up at portrait)

He was a good man.  Notorious as an

eccentric, but that was something he

cultivated.  He

wanted

to be

legendary.

WELLES

He succeeded.

MRS CHRISTIAN

We were married forty-five years.

Hard even for me to imagine.  We had

our troubles.  There were plenty of

places for him to be other than

here, but he was always loyal to me,

and I to him.  I loved him deeply.

MRS CHRISTIAN

Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?

WELLES

I wear a gun when I can tell a

client expects me to.  Other than

that, there's never any reason.

MRS CHRISTIAN

Just curious.

MRS CHRISTIAN

My husband was the only one with the

combination to this safe.  I knew

about it, but as far as I was

concerned it was none of my

business.  Not till now, that is.

WELLES

You hired someone to open it.  I'll

bet the lawyer loved that.

MRS CHRISTIAN

There was nothing he could do.  My

husband left everything to me.

(looks at safe)

I prevented anyone from seeing the

contents.  I felt these were my

husband's private things.  I

didn't... I didn't realize...

WELLES

Do you want to tell me what you

found?

MRS CHRISTIAN

Cash, stock certificates, and this...

MRS CHRISTIAN

It's a film... of a girl being

murdered.

WELLES

I'm afraid I don't...

MRS CHRISTIAN

This is a movie showing a girl being

murdered.  She's sitting on a bed,

and a man rapes her... and he begins

to cut her with a knife...

(pause)

I only watched what I could.

MRS CHRISTIAN

I didn't know what to think.  I

can't tell you how horrible it's

been, to know this belonged to my

husband.  To know that he watched

this... this atrocity.  But, I can't

go to the police...

WELLES

Mrs. Christian... please, will you

sit down a moment?

(leads her to a chair)

I want you to listen carefully.

What you're talking about is a

"snuff film."  But, from what I

know, snuff films are a kind of...

urban myth.  Like, red light

district folklore.  There's no such

thing, I can assure you.

WELLES

Please, believe me.  This is

probably a stag film.  Simulated

rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might

seem real, but there are ways of

making it look realistic... fake

blood and special effects...

MRS CHRISTIAN

No.

WELLES

If you were to study it you'd see

the camera cutting away... you'd see

the tricks they can play...

MRS CHRISTIAN

I'm telling you it's not that.

WELLES

I'm sure it is.

(smiles)

It's probably something your husband

was given as a bad joke.  More than

likely he never even watched it.

MRS CHRISTIAN

Will you watch it and see for

yourself?

WELLES

Of course.  But, I'm certain it's

nothing to worry about.

WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM

, but Welles

WELLES

You... you need to go to the police.

MRS CHRISTIAN

I told you I can't, not yet.

WELLES

You don't have any other choice.

MRS CHRISTIAN

(stands, shakes her head)

No.  For me to live with the ruin of

my husband's name, I need know that

whoever did this will be punished.

If you can find them, I will take

their names to the police.  I'll say

my husband confessed on his death

bed. I'll say I didn't have courage

to come forward at first...

WELLES

It won't work like that.

MRS CHRISTIAN

Any evidence you collect can be

given to the police later,

anonymously.  I've thought about it

and there's no other way.  If you

can't find them... if the only thing

that comes from this film is that

this is all my husband will be

remembered for, well I can't let

that happen.  I'm telling you I

won't.  If there's no chance that

poor girl's memory can be served,

then I'll just have to spend my last

days trying to forget her.

WELLES

I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate

investigations...

MRS CHRISTIAN

You've found missing persons before.

WELLES

Nothing remotely like this.

MRS CHRISTIAN

I know what I'm asking.  Your

compensation will be appropriate to

the risk.  You'll need cash to buy

information, and I'll provide it.

(pause)

I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.

(pause)

You saw what he did to her.

WELLES

This is the mortgage.  This is

Cindy's college money.

AMY

I understand.

WELLES

Sometimes you can't know what I'm

doing.  It's better that way.

AMY

I know.

WELLES

It's a missing persons case... a

long shot.  I'll give it two months,

two months at most, then I'll be

back.  We'll take a vacation.

AMY

Why the gun?

WELLES

I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even

wear it.  It's a precaution.

(cleaning gun)

Don't worry about me.

DIRECTOR

What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?

WELLES

Call me Tom.

DIRECTOR

Alright, Tom.

WELLES

What I'd like, very simply, is

access to your archive.  And, now I

understand this isn't something you

normally do for private citizens...

DIRECTOR

There are reasons for the way we do

things here.

WELLES

Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by

whatever decision you make, but I'd

appreciate if you'll hear me out...

WELLES

Few days ago, I was contacted by a

couple living in Philadelphia, a

doctor and his wife.  What happened

was they picked up a young girl

hitchhiking off 81, which heads into

Philadelphia, started up a

conversation with this girl, she

looked homeless, seemed about

eighteen maybe.  They convinced her

to let them buy her a meal in the

city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have

much to say, but they got a sense

she's a runaway, so all through

dinner the doctor's working on her,

trying to convince her that at the

very least she should pick up a

telephone.  Not surprisingly, she

ate her food, excused herself...

(snaps fingers)

That's the last they saw her.  The

reason they came to me for help, the

reason I'm coming to you, is we had

a friend of mine in the department

work up a sketch...

(shows the POLICE ARTIST

SKETCH he photocopied)

They want to see if I can I.D. this

girl, somehow pass along a message

to let the parents know the kid's

alive, doing alright.

DIRECTOR

Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or

N.C.M.E.C.?

WELLES

I figured you share information.

DIRECTOR

We do.

WELLES

For whatever reasons I thought you

might be more receptive.

DIRECTOR

Why don't they come to me?

WELLES

This doctor and wife, they're nice

people, but they don't want to get

too involved.  They're not trying to

have the parents come looking for

the girl either.

You and I both know sometimes, not

often, but sometimes there's real

reasons why a kid'll run.

Molestation, whatever.  Besides

that, the girl's probably eighteen,

so she's legal.

DIRECTOR

I'm not so sure about this.

WELLES

They're putting themselves in place

of this kid's parents and thinking

they'd want to hear their girl's

okay, even if that's all they hear.

DIRECTOR

I can give you my card, if your

clients want to call me...

WELLES

They were pretty clear they didn't

want this coming back on them.

DIRECTOR

Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.

WELLES

Who knows... maybe she's already

given her parents a call, right?

WELLES

Fuck.

DIRECTOR

Excuse me... Tom, hold on...

DIRECTOR

Listen, maybe I can help after all.

Why don't you come on back in...

we'll see what we can do.

DIRECTOR

This is it.  It's not much.

(points at computers)

We've got less than five percent on

computer and we lose that funding in

December.  I'll have someone show it

to you anyway.  Other than that, I'm

afraid it's the wet thumb method.

DIRECTOR

Files are mostly by state and year

of disappearance.  We try to keep

the children and adults separate.

No eating or smoking in here, but

there's a coffee machine in the hall.

WELLES

Any good?

DIRECTOR

It's horrible, but it'll be your

best friend after a few days.  I

hope you realize what kind of long

shot you're chasing after.

WELLES

You're gonna be seeing a lot of me.

You're sure you don't mind?

DIRECTOR

It's good what you're doing.

WELLES

(into PHONE)

Hello, Mrs. Christian?  Tom Welles.

Here's where we stand.  I checked

the film stock and it's called Supra-

lux 544.  The company that made that

stock discontinued it in '92...

(listens)

Yeah, about five or six years ago.

Anyway, do what you can to dig up

your husband's old financial

records, look for anything out of

the ordinary...

PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER

:

WELLES (V.O., cont)

Nobody really uses eight millimeter

film anymore, so we can assume there

are reasons our guys did.  First,

they could develop it themselves if

they had any sort of expertise.

Obviously, this isn't the kind of

movie you can just drop off at the

one-hour photo...

WELLES (V.O., cont)

Second, the film that went through

the camera is what we've got.

There's no negative.  Unlike video,

it wasn't meant to be duplicated.

No reason for them to risk having

more than one copy of their murder

floating around...

WELLES (V.O., cont)

There don't seen to be many

fingerprints on the film itself, but

I'm going to have to be careful to

leave them intact...

WELLES (V.O., cont)

It's okay for yours and your

husbands fingerprints to be on the

film, but you'll have to use me as

a middleman if you go to the police.

That way I don't have to explain why

my prints are on it...

WELLES (V.O., cont)

There were three men.  Two are

obvious; the man in the mask and the

man running the camera, but I caught

a glimpse of a third man in a

mirror.  It's nothing that can be

used for identification, but he was

there, watching...

WELLES (V.O., cont)

So, there were three.  They would

have kept it small, wouldn't have

let anyone in on it they didn't have

to.  That's all for now... except,

I feel I should tell you... with

this looking like it happened at

least five or six years ago...

WELLES (V.O., cont)

Well, it's not very likely we'll

ever find out who this girl was.

(listens)

I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye.

MRS MATHEWS

Yes... ?

WELLES

(smiles)

Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's

Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed

investigator...

WELLES

I've been hired as an independent

contractor by the U.S. Resource

Center for Missing Persons as part

of an internal audit.  If you have

any time over the next few days, I'd

like to make an appointment to ask

some questions about the

disappearance of your daughter.

MRS MATHEWS

I don't understand, who are... ?

WELLES

I'm sorry, let me explain, the

R.C.M.P. is a support organization

and archive, not unlike the Center

for Missing and Exploited Children

in Washington.  I'm sure you've

dealt with them before?

MRS MATHEWS

Yes, but...

WELLES

These volunteer organizations are

sort of interconnected, functioning

hand in hand with law enforcement.

The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review

their investigations...

(holds up clipboard)

... fact-check their records, see if

there's anything they missed,

anything they should be doing

different.  I'm here for a few days,

before I head back up to Virginia.

These reports go to the Justice

Department eventually.  I spoke to

your F.B.I. contact a few days ago,

uh...

WELLES

What was the name... ? I've got it

here somewhere...

MRS MATHEWS

Neil... Neil Cole.

WELLES

(pretends he found it)

Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call

and let you know to expect me.  He

didn't call?

MRS MATHEWS

No.

WELLES

(looking on legal pad)

Well, I'm following up on your

daughter, Mary, height; five four,

weight; hundred ten pounds, brown

eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24,

1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A

runaway, that's how she's listed.

Is this information correct... ?

WELLES

I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy.

Is there a more convenient time... ?

(looks at watch)

Can I buy you lunch, would that be

alright?

WELLES

It's very important you don't let

this raise your expectations.  It's

not going to effect any ongoing

efforts.  All I'm saying is, please

know, I'm not here to create any

false hope.

MRS MATHEWS

They hired you.  You're like, a

private detective?

WELLES

That's exactly what I am.

MRS MATHEWS

I didn't think there were private

detectives anymore, except on TV.

WELLES

You probably expect me to be wearing

a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking

whiskey, chasing women and getting

beaten up by guys with broken noses.

Want to know what it's really like?

It's sitting in a car and staring at

a hotel window for three days

straight, pissing in a plastic

bottle, pardon me, because some guy

thinks his wife's cheating on him.

Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who

hired you, he has a hair-lip,

dandruff and crooked teeth, and you

could have told him the minute you

laid eyes on him his wife's

cheating, and you don't blame her.

WELLES

It's refreshing to actually sit down

and meet someone face to face,

someone nice like you.

WELLES

So, she didn't leave a note?  She

never gave any indication where she

might go, before she left?

MRS MATHEWS

No.

WELLES

She just seemed... depressed... ?

MRS MATHEWS

She didn't seem herself.  For months

there never was any way to get her

to talk about it.  One night we went

to bed... the next morning she was

gone.  She took some clothes.

WELLES

What was she running from?

MRS MATHEWS

I don't know.

WELLES

If there's anything you feel

uncomfortable talking about, tell

me, but I have to ask.  Your

husband... he committed suicide?

MRS MATHEWS

Yes.

WELLES

September 4th, 1993.  About a year

after Mary disappeared.

MRS MATHEWS

We were divorced by then.  Things

fell apart... he was living with a

friend...

WELLES

Why do you think he did it?

MRS MATHEWS

It got to be too much for him.

WELLES

You have to forgive me, but in these

circumstances... with your

daughter...

(pause)

Were there any indications of... any

sort of abuse?

MRS MATHEWS

There wasn't anything like that.

The police and the FBI people asked,

but there wasn't anything happened

like that, never.  My husband... his

heart broke when Mary left...

WELLES

I didn't mean to...

MRS MATHEWS

You try going through what we did.

Bob couldn't take it, that's all.

Christ, there's times when it still

seems like I can't either.

WELLES

I had to ask.  I apologize.

MRS MATHEWS

No one knows what it's like.  You

can't even imagine how much it hurts.

MRS MATHEWS

People remember me from the news.

(pause)

Can you drive me back now?

WELLES

Of course.

MRS MATHEWS

This is her room.

MRS MATHEWS

The police made a wreck of it, but

I put it back exactly how it was.

Just how she likes it.

MRS MATHEWS

Those are for her birthday.  One for

every year she's missed.  They'll be

waiting for her when she comes back.

WELLES

I... I shouldn't take anymore of

your time.  Maybe we can finish

tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...

MRS MATHEWS

Okay.

WELLES

(into phone)

You should be able to take a shower

and still have hot water left, honey.

(listens)

Call him back and tell him I said

so.  The goddamn thing's still under

warranty.

(listens)

I'm okay.  It's hard here.  It's

hard.

(listens)

I've got a lead I have to follow

through.  To be honest, I don't

think I'm going to get very far.

I miss you.  I love you.

MRS MATHEWS

We weren't religious.  We never

forced religion down her throat,

like I've seen some parents do to

their kids.  We never made her go to

church.  But, after Mary was gone,

that's when I got religious.

MRS MATHEWS

Doesn't make much sense, does it?

When everything's happy, when life's

fine and you have every reason to

believe there's a God, you don't

bother.  Then, something horrible

happens... that's when you start

praying all the time.  That's when

you start going to church.

WELLES

We're all like that.

MRS MATHEWS

Are you religious?

WELLES

No.

MRS MATHEWS

You should be.

WELLES

I've got what I need for my report.

There is... there is one thing that

bothers me though.

MRS MATHEWS

What?

WELLES

It's not really my place, but it's

not easy for me to set aside the

private detective part of me either.

See, I know a little about missing

persons.  When kids run, they almost

always leave a note.  It's guilt.

They want to say goodbye.

MRS MATHEWS

There wasn't one.  The police looked.

WELLES

Do you think the police did a good

job?

MRS MATHEWS

I don't know.  I think so.

WELLES

It is possible... and I know this

isn't something you want to hear.

Your daughter may have tried to hide

a note where she thought you would

eventually find it, but where she

knew your husband would never find

it.  She might have wanted to tell

you something...

MRS MATHEWS

No.  You don't have any reason to

think that...

WELLES

If the police focused their search

in

her

room,

her

belongings, well

that'd be only natural, but they may

have been looking in the wrong place.

MRS MATHEWS

How... how can you say that to me...?

WELLES

Will you let me look?

MRS MATHEWS

My husband never laid a hand on her.

She would have told me... she would

have told me...

WELLES

You're probably right, and I

probably won't find anything.

I don't have a right to ask this,

and you can kick me out of your

house if you want, but this is my

profession and there's a part of me

that can't let it go.  Police are

just as human as you or I.  They

could have missed something.  They

probably didn't.

(pause)

Wouldn't you rather know?

MRS MATHEWS

Go ahead and look if you want.  I

don't care what you do.

drawers, methodically, replacing everything as it was...

searches hat boxes and shoe boxes in a CLOSET... takes

BOOKS off SHELVES, fanning the pages, shaking them out...

CABINET, examining old prescription bottles... opens

CABINETS under the sink...

staring at a soap opera on TELEVISION, a BOTTLE of scotch

on TV tray beside her, drink in hand.

CABINETS... looks through low CABINETS, on his knees, pulls

out pots and pans... fans the pages of COOK BOOKS...

He takes a few steps back into the HALLWAY, looks up at the

ceiling.  There's an ATTIC DOOR there.  Welles reaches to

the door's handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs...

-In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT,

crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES

of PHOTOGRAPHS; old photos of a wedding, of grandparents...

Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large

WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath...

Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS

in mothballs.  He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out,

opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE.

He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray.

Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY.

Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: "

Mary Anne Mathews.

"

Welles turns pages.  The DIARY'S about half-full of

feminine, cursive handwriting.  After the last written

page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT.  Welles fingers the ragged

edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the

very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE.  Welles sits and reads...

MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)

(emotionless monotone)

"Dear mom.  If you're reading this,

it means I called you from

Hollywood, California and told you

where to find my diary.  I don't

think I'll be able to tell you this

when I talk to you, so I'm writing

it down here.  You know I haven't

been happy for a long, long time.

For a long time now dad's been doing

things I couldn't tell you.  He's

worse.  I can't stay anymore.  I

know you and I haven't always gotten

along sometimes, but please don't

blame yourself.  There isn't

anything you can do.  I'm going to

make a whole new life in California.

Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or

in magazines.  Don't worry about me.

Love, Mary Anne."

WELLES

You were right.

(pause)

I didn't find anything.  I'm going

to run and get something to eat.

Are you hungry?

MRS MATHEWS

Yes.

WELLES

Do you ever consider... do you

realize that Mary may never come

back?

MRS MATHEWS

I think about it everyday.  But,

every time the phone rings... every

single time, I still think it's her.

WELLES

It's been six years.

MRS MATHEWS

What am I supposed to do?  Forget

her?  Time heals all wounds, right?

(misery building)

She's all I think about, and I've

learned to live with that.  But, you

want the truth... the real truth?

If I had a choice... if I had to

choose, between her being out there,

living a good life and being happy,

and me not knowing; never finding

out what happened to her...

(pause)

... or her being dead and me

knowing...

(pause)

I'd choose to know.

WELLES

Excuse me, I have to use your

bathroom.

better than me?  Kathy doesn't even

it.  She says they did it last

weekend while her parents were out

happened today when dad and I were

alone.  I can't tell anyone.  I feel

sick.  What did I ever do to make

this happen to me?"

California, I'll be okay.  I've got

money saved.  I can work as a

Pardon me?

My boss tells me I have to do more

suggestive selling.

WELLES

Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.

MAX

It's your call, but you're gonna be

sorry when you're in one of those

battery-operated vagina and you

don't have one.

Good for you.

How long you been working there?

MAX

Three, four years.

WELLES

What's your name, if you don't mind

me asking?

MAX

Max.

WELLES

Well, here's the deal, Max.  This

thing I'm on right now has something

to do with underground pornography.

Stuff that's sold under the counter,

illegally...

MAX

There's not much illegal.

WELLES

Well, whatever there is, whoever's

dealing, however it's done, I want

to know.  I want a good look, so if

you've got that kind of connection,

great.  If not, speak now.

MAX

You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask

and you are, you have to tell me.

I'm not a cop.

What are you doing out here?

WELLES

Well, there's the thing; you're not

gonna know anything about what I'm

doing, but you can make some money.

MAX

How much?

WELLES

How much do you make now?

MAX

Four hundred a week, off the books.

WELLES

Okay, let's pretend I live in the

four hundred a week in that dump.

I'll give you six hundred for a few

ANGRY DEALER

There ain't no such thing as snuff.

Why don't you fuck off?

LARGE MAN

You have to pay to come in here.

MAX

You've got Penthouse, Playboy,

Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers

them pornography anymore.  Then,

there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple

X.  The difference is penetration.

That's hardcore.  That whole

industry's up in the valley.

Writers, directors, porn stars.

They're celebrities, or they think

they are.  They pump out 150 videos

a week.  A

week

.  They've even got

a porno Academy Awards.  America

loves pornography.  Anybody tells

you they never use pornography,

they're lying.  Somebody's buying

those videos.  Somebody's out there

spending 900 million dollars a year

on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's

only gonna get worse.  More and more

you'll see perverse hardcore coming

into the mainstream, because that's

evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my

God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his

hips, how offensive!  Nowadays,

Mtv's showing girls dancing around

in thong bikinis with their asses

hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For

the porn-addict, big tits aren't big

enough after a while.  They have to

be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn

chicks are putting in breast

implants bigger than your head,

literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be

Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler,

Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore

films'll be medical films.

People'll be jerking off to women

laying around with open wounds.

There's nowhere else for it to go.

WELLES

Interesting theory.

MAX

What you saw tonight, we're not

talking about a video some dentist

takes home over the weekend.  We're

talking about stuff where people get

hurt.  Specialty product.

WELLES

Child pornography.

MAX

There's two kinds of specialty

product; legal and illegal.  Foot

fetish, shit films, watersports,

bondage, spanking, fisting, she-

males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond

hardcore, but legal.  This is the

kind of hardcore where one guy's

going to look at it and throw up,

another guy looks at it and falls in

love.  Now, with some of the S+M and

bondage films, they straddle the

line.  How are you supposed to tell

if the person tied up with the ball

gag in their mouth is a consenting

or not?  Step over that line, you're

into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but

there aren't many.  I've never seen

one.

WELLES

Snuff films.

MAX

I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't

yanking you around.  There's no such

thing.

WELLES

What other ways are there to get

illegal films?  Who do you see?

MAX

First of all, basement sales like

tonight aren't gonna last much

longer.  It's too risky, one, and

two, everything's going on the

internet.  Anyone with a computer

and enough patience can find

anything he wants.  It's heaven for

those degenerate chicken-hawks.

They're swapping pictures back and

forth as fast as their modems can

zap 'em.  But, there's still some

weird shit under the counter where

I work sometimes.  No one knows where

it comes from.  That's local

underground, where information

spreads by word of mouth.  Those are

zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their

hands are permanently pruned.  They

go out in the sun they don't burn,

they blister.  Other than that, all

I know about is the mail.

Classified ads in the paper with

hidden codes.  Secret couriers.

Credit card orders to dummy

corporations.  Interstate wire

transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes.

But, if you're asking me who do you

go to to get illegal shit... who

knows?  That's the whole point --

the seller stays as far away from

the buyer as possible, and vice

versa, and cops can't trace the

deal.  There's ways to do it so

nobody knows who anybody is.

WELLES

How old are you?

MAX

Twenty-five.

WELLES

Where are your parents?

MAX

I don't know, where are yours?

WELLES

I don't mean any offense... but what

are you doing mixed up in all this?

MAX

I'm not mixed up in anything,

hayseed.  What are you talking about?

WELLES

You just strike me as smart enough

to be doing something else.

MAX

Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What

choices have I got?  Fuck, just

because I know about stuff like

tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I

work a job.  It beats pumping gas,

beats making hamburgers.

WELLES

You're telling me it doesn't get to

you?

MAX

You can't sit there all day watching

the parade of losers that comes into

that place without going numb.  So

what?

Am I gonna go off and be a race car

driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for

President?  What about you, pops?

WELLES

What about me?

MAX

I see a ring on your finger.  You

have any kids?

WELLES

A daughter.

MAX

So, you have a wife and kid waiting

for you in Pennsylvania... what are

you

doing mixed up in all this?

WELLES

Good question.

MRS CHRISTIAN

(into phone)

My husband had five cash accounts he

used to temporarily hold stock

profits.  Between November of 1991

and March of 1992, he wrote one

check out to cash from each account.

He wrote these himself...

WELLES

(into phone)

Okay...

MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

(from phone)

My husband never dealt with money

personally, certainly not cash.

WELLES

I'm not positive this means anything.

MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

The checks were for odd amounts...

MRS CHRISTIAN

(into phone)

One was for two hundred thousand,

one dollar and thirteen cents.

Another was for three hundred

thousand, six hundred fifty four

dollars and seventy six cents...

WELLES (V.O.)

(from phone)

Okay, I follow you so far...

MRS CHRISTIAN

Totalled together, these five checks

from five different accounts, they

equal one million dollars.

WELLES

(into phone)

You're joking.

MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

(from phone)

To the penny.  Exactly one million

dollars in cash.

MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

Hello... ?

WELLES

I'm here.

MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

Do you think the film could have

cost that much?

WELLES

For a human life... murder on film,

no statute of limitations.  Who

knows?  It sure could have.  I'd

like you to overnight me a copy of

those checks, then put them in a

safe deposit box.

MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

Okay.

WELLES

Send it to me through the post

office like we arranged.  No return

address.  You dug this up all by

yourself?

MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

You told me to look, so I looked.

WELLES

You're one hell of a detective, Mrs.

Christian.

WELLES

Her name was Mary Anne Mathews.

NUN

Yes... I remember Mary

WELLES

You... you do?  You're sure?

Please, Sister, will you take

another look, make sure...

NUN

(examines picture)

Yes.  I remember her.

NUN

She lived here for only about a

month, if I recall correctly.  She

didn't return one night.  She never

came back.  I didn't know what to

think...

NUN

Do you know what happened to her?

WELLES

I'm trying to find out.  She was a

runaway.  I'm looking into it for

her parents.

NUN

(pointing on shelf)

Can you get that down for me?

NUN

No, the next shelf... there...

WELLES

What is this?

NUN

Those are her belongings.

WELLES

Her belongings?

NUN

That's her suitcase.  I had

forgotten it, till you showed me

her picture.

Mary Anne Mathews,

" no address.  Welles looks to the nun.

WELLES

Whatever possessed you to keep this

all this time?

NUN

She was the kindest, sweetest girl

you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I

adored her.  I supposed I always

hoped she'd be back.  After a time,

all I could do was pray she had

moved on to better things.  Can you

get this suitcase to her parents, if

you think it's appropriate?

I'll do what I can.

doctor says I've gotten the flu, or

some other wretched ailment.

WELLES (V.O.)

I hope it's nothing serious.

MRS CHRISTIAN

Nothing more than a bother.  Have

you any news for me?

WELLES

(into phone)

I've made progress.  I'm in

Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces

fall into place, I'll drive to you

and give you an update.

MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)

(from phone)

Fine...

WELLES

I've got about five thousand left in

cash, but I'll need another thirty,

if you approve.

MRS CHRISTIAN

How will I get it to you?

WELLES

If you have a pencil and paper, I'll

tell you how to send it.

MAX

You didn't say it was gonna be this

luxurious.

WELLES

It's their Presidential Suite.

MAX

Great.

MAX

Oh, come on, man, what are we doing

in this flea bag?

WELLES

It's cheap, and people know to mind

their own business. What have you

got for me?

MAX

Dino Velvet.

WELLES

Max... wake up...

MAX

Wha... ?

WELLES

(points at TV)

Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?

MAX

He's one of the lunatics Dino uses.

He's in a bunch of these.

MAX

Why?  He have something to do with

whatever you're into?

WELLES

No... it's nothing... that's not him.

WELLES

Who is he?

MAX

I told you, he's one of Dino

Velvet's stock players...

WELLES

Who is he, his

name

?

MAX

Nobody knows his name.  That's his

thing.  He always wears a mask.  You

never see his face.  He calls

himself "Machine," that's what they

call him.  Machine.

MAX

They say he's half brain-dead from

all the steroids he's using.

MAX

He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He

loves what he does for a living.

WELLES

You don't need to be here.

MAX

What kind of Junior P.I. would I be

if I didn't go with you?

MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

(from intercom)

Who is it?

THUG

You're in the wrong place.

WELLES

We're looking for Mr. Velvet.

THUG

He's not here.

WELLES

Why don't you tell him we're here to

give him a large sum of money.  If

he's not interested, we'll go.

THUG

You should leave now, before I have

to remove you.

DINO VELVET'S VOICE (V.O.)

(from SPEAKERS)

Show them in, Milo.

WELLES

You heard the boss, Milo.

DINO VELVET

Come in.  Make yourself comfortable.

WELLES

It's an honor to meet you.  Thank

you for seeing us.

DINO VELVET

What can I do for you today?

WELLES

I'd like to commission a work.  I'm

a great admirer of yours.

DINO VELVET

Flattering.  And, who's your

colorful little chum?

WELLES

A fellow investor.

DINO VELVET

Hmm.

MAX

You're the only one still shooting

film and transferring it to video.

Nobody appreciates that kind of

integrity anymore... the grain, the

gritty look you get.

DINO VELVET

Well, I'm glad you appreciate it.

(to Welles)

What would you say is your favorite

piece?

MAX

I know if I had to pick, it'd be

"Choke," or "Devil."

WELLES

"Devil" frightened me as much as it

excited me, but I'd be hard pressed

to choose a favorite.

DINO VELVET

You said something about money.

WELLES

Yes.  What we're looking for is

rather specific.

WELLES

That's five thousand dollars.

DINO VELVET

Is it?

WELLES

Five thousand now, five thousand on

delivery.

Two women, one white and one black,

as long as they have large breasts.

Hard bondage, or course.  Other than

that, trusting your artistic

interpretation, I have only two

stipulations.

DINO VELVET

And they are?

WELLES

I want to watch you work.

DINO VELVET

I'll consider it.

WELLES

And the other performer... it has to

be that monster you use... the man

in the mask.

DINO VELVET

Machine.

WELLES

If it's not him, there's no deal.

DINO VELVET

He might be interested... but it

would mean another five thousand.

WELLES

We can do that.

DINO VELVET

Well, well, I'll have to put my

thinking-cap on about all this.

You'll leave the money as a deposit?

(off Welles' nod)

Very good.

DINO VELVET

You have a beautiful face... the way

the light hits it.  I'd like to take

your picture.  You don't mind?

WELLES

I'd rather you didn't.

DINO VELVET

What's the problem?

WELLES

I'm camera shy.

DINO VELVET

You trust me to keep your money, but

not to take your picture?

WELLES

Those are two different kinds of

trust.

(stands)

Thank you for your time.  I hope we

can do business.

WELLES

(into phone)

So, what do you say?

DINO VELVET

(into phone)

I'll do this for you.  Fifteen

thousand dollars.

WELLES (V.O.)

(from phone)

Machine's in?

DINO VELVET

(into phone)

He's in.  It will be his pleasure.

DINO VELVET (V.O.)

(from phone)

Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three

o'clock, tomorrow.

WELLES

(into phone)

Where's that?

DINO VELVET (V.O.)

Brooklyn.  Don't be late.

MAX

What's next?

WELLES

I'm trying to figure that out

myself.  I have to see Machine

without his mask.

MAX

Still don't want to tell me what

you're doing?

WELLES

Nope.

WELLES

This is for you.

MAX

What's this?

WELLES

It's money.  People use it to

purchase goods and services.

MAX

Look... that's awful generous and

everything...

WELLES

It's not my money.  The woman I got

it from is never going to give it a

second thought.  Let's not make a

big deal out of this, okay?

(pause)

Go be a race car driver.  Go run for

President.  Whatever.

WELLES

I'll see you around.

DINO VELVET

There you are.  Come join us.

WELLES

(to Machine)

Hello.

DINO VELVET

You brought the money?

WELLES

(takes out envelope)

Right here.

DINO VELVET

Excellent.

WELLES

Where are the women?

DINO VELVET

They should be here any minute.

WELLES

(of the knifes)

What are these for?

DINO VELVET

Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just

props.  Nice, aren't they?

WELLES

Sure.

DINO VELVET

Machine and I were just talking

about knifes.  The beauty of

knifes...

DINO VELVET

He was saying how fascinated he is

by their simple ability to be sharp.

The ability of a piece of metal to

be so thin that it is almost

nothing...

DINO VELVET

So close to nothingness that it cuts

with minimum effort, because it's so

non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It

blooms open as the blade widens, but

by then it's too late, because the

knife's already doing its pure,

simple damage.

DINO VELVET

Ah, ours guests have arrived.

DINO VELVET

Mister Welles... would you be so

kind as to remove any firearms from

your person?

WELLES

What are you... ?

DINO VELVET

Take out your gun!

DINO VELVET

Slowly.  Let me see it.

DINO VELVET

Empty the gun onto the table, very

carefully.

WELLES

Look, I don't know what this...

DINO VELVET

Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say,

or I'll put this arrow through your

throat.

EDDIE

Is that him?

DINO VELVET

(to Welles)

Put the gun down, take the

handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the

bed.

DINO VELVET

(still to Welles)

Didn't know what to make of you at

first, and you certainly had Eddie

on pins and needles.  But, lo and

behold, from out of the blue came an

old business acquaintance to explain

everything...

EDDIE

This is the fucker?  Motherfucker,

doesn't look like anything...

EDDIE

Doesn't look like shit.

DINO VELVET

(to Welles)

You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

WELLES

I remember him.

LONGDALE

Let's get this over with.

DINO VELVET

Fine idea.

DINO VELVET

You're going to go get the film you

received from Mrs. Christian, bring

it here and put it in my hand.  And

to save time, so we make this as

efficient as possible, there's an

incentive...

WELLES

No...

DINO VELVET

Friend of yours?

WELLES

Look, he's got nothing to do with

this... let him go...

DINO VELVET

Can you guess what I'm going to say

next?

WELLES

He doesn't know anything... he's got

nothing to do with this...

DINO VELVET

Bring the film, or we kill him.

WELLES

I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit

box, in the city...

DINO VELVET

How cooperative.  Longdale will keep

you company.

DINO VELVET

Don't let Longdale's questionable

choice of weapon give you any ideas.

If his fey little gun puts enough

little holes in you, you'll be just

as dead... and so will Max.

EDDIE

Move it, dirtbag... !

DINO VELVET

(watching them go)

Do hurry.

WELLES

You were the middleman, am I right?

Old man Christian wasn't about to go

shopping for a snuff film himself.

LONGDALE

Wouldn't exactly have been possible

for a man of his stature.

WELLES

So, he sent you, gave you the money,

his errand-boy.  And if you refused,

it wasn't like you could tell anyone

your pervert boss just asked you to

get him a snuff film.  That's the

beauty of lawyer/client privilege.

LONGDALE

That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted

me implicitly.

WELLES

Must have paid you a lot, for you to

risk everything.  Would've had to

have cut yourself a real nice piece

of money.

LONGDALE

I was well compensated.

WELLES

That's why you got scared when Mrs.

Christian hired me.  You knew about

the film, figured it had to be in

that safe.  How'd you find me?

LONGDALE

Never mind how I found you.

WELLES

Followed me... must have freaked out

when you saw me closing in on your

buddies...

LONGDALE

They're no friends of mine.

WELLES

Except, you're willing commit murder

with them.

LONGDALE

None of this would be happening if

you would have left it alone.  If

you weren't digging up a girl who

died six years ago.  A girl no one

even remembers.

WELLES

Mary Anne Mathews, that was her

name.  Her mom remembers her.

WELLES

You found these smut dealers and

asked to buy a snuff film, right?

Wanted them to find you one.  Well,

they didn't

find

you one, Longdale,

they went out and

made

you one...

LONGDALE

Shut up.

WELLES

Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you

paid money to have her murdered.

LONGDALE

Shut your mouth and drive!

WELLES

Did it get him off, huh, watching

them cut her up?  Tell me, because

I really want to understand.  Did he

jerk off to it?  You watch it with

him, sit there giving him a handjob

while you both watched... ?

LONGDALE

You're making me very angry.

WELLES

Just tell me.  Tell me some more of

the secrets you and Christian

shared. What kind of degenerate

pervert was he really?  What the

fuck did he want with a snuff film?

LONGDALE

You're asking me why?

WELLES

I'm asking.

LONGDALE

A man like Mr. Christian, a great

man... all his money, all his

power... a man who attained

everything there was to attain...

WELLES

Why did he buy a film of some poor,

lost girl getting butchered?

LONGDALE

Isn't it incredibly obvious?

WELLES

Enlighten me.

LONGDALE

Because he could.  He did it because

he could.

(pause)

What other reason were you looking

for?

LONGDALE

You've got four minutes till I call

Mr. Velvet and let him know there's

a problem.

MANAGER

May I show you to a booth...

WELLES

No, I've got it.

LONGDALE

You almost went over your limit.

WELLES

Fuck you.

LONGDALE

Give me the film.

WELLES

You'll get it when we get there.

LONGDALE

Give me the film.

WELLES

Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try

driving to Brooklyn with my brains

all over the windshield.

Max is tied to the target,

slumped over, three arrows in his chest

.  Dead.

WELLES

No!!

WELLES

You fuckers!

EDDIE

You're a dead man.

DINO VELVET

Leave him alone.

EDDIE

Fuck off.

EDDIE

What the fuck... !

DINO

I promised him to Machine.

EDDIE

... sorry...

DINO VELVET

First things first.  You might want

to watch this, Mr. Welles...

WELLES

Don't... please...

DINO VELVET

And so it ends.  It's as if she

never existed.

DINO VELVET

Don't blame yourself.  You were in

way over your head.

WELLES

Motherfuckers.  Small time,

motherfuckers... !  Tell me

something...

WELLES

I know why you did it, Dino,

Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do

it?  Must have been a helluva lot of

money, right?  One fuckload of

money...

WELLES

So, what are you all still doing

small time, huh?  What are you still

doing in the sewer, Eddie?!

Christian gave Longdale a million

dollars to find him a snuff film.

How much did you ever see... ?

EDDIE

What's he talking about?

WELLES

One million dollars, Dino.  How much

did he tell you he had...

LONGDALE

He's lying.

WELLES

Look at him.  You think he played it

square?  How much did he give you,

how much did he keep for himself?

EDDIE

What the fuck's he talking about?

LONGDALE

Stay away from me.

DINO VELVET

What's going on, Longdale?  Did this

happen?

EDDIE

You sell us short, you fuck?

LONGDALE

Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie,

show it to me.  Now!

LONGDALE

Put it on the ground, kick it here...

EDDIE

You fucking lawyer...

LONGDALE

Move back!  All of you... move!

DINO VELVET

What were you thinking?

LONGDALE

Back off!  Everything's been taken

care of, and I'm leaving now...

DINO VELVET

You're not going anywhere if you

fucked us, lawyer.

LONGDALE

I'm leaving.

EDDIE

You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna

kill us all, is that it?

DINO VELVET

You betrayed us.

LONGDALE

Stay where you are!

LONGDALE

Keep back!

DINO VELVET

You're not gonna live through this.

LONGDALE

Our business is done, I'm leaving,

no one's going to stop me...

DINO VELVET

Fuck you!

EDDIE

Fuck.

MACHINE (O.S.)

NO!

MACHINE

He's mine!

WELLES

No, no, no... please, don't kill

me... please... !

EDDIE

Do him good.

WELLES

Back off, Eddie...

WELLES

Stop Eddie!

WELLES

(pulls back the hammer)

I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in

the back... !

WELLES

Come back, or I put a hole in him.

WELLES

You might make it to your gun, but

not before I shoot Machine.  And if

I have to shoot him because of you,

and I don't kill him, right after he

kills me, he's gonna kill you.

WELLES

(to Machine)

Take off the mask.

WELLES

Take it off!

MACHINE

You got one bullet.

MACHINE

The only choice you have now, is

which one of us kills you.

MACHINE

Get the gun!

AMY

(into phone)

Hello?

WELLES (V.O.)

(from phone)

Amy, it's me.  Listen very

carefully..

AMY

(into phone)

Tom?  Where have you been... ?

WELLES

(into phone)

Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and

get out of the house.  Do it now.

Go to a hotel and stay there...

AMY (V.O.)

(from phone)

What's wrong?  Are you alright?

WELLES

(into phone)

I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't

explain.  Don't use the phone, just

pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my

way.  I'll be back at the house in

three hours.  Call me from the hotel

when you get there

AMY (V.O.)

... What's going on?

WELLES

Just do it, Amy, please, go.

WELLES

(into phone)

Honey... ?

MACHINE (V.O.)

(from phone)

Not quite.

MACHINE (V.O.)

Nothing like getting home after a

rough day.  Home sweet home.

MACHINE (V.O.)

Walk away.  Pack your bags, put the

wife and kid in the car and find a

place to hide.  If you're lucky,

you'll never see me again.

WELLES

I don't know if I can do that.

MACHINE (V.O.)

I know who you are.  I know where

you live.  I know everything I need

to know to find you.

(pause)

Who am I?

AMY

What happened to you?

WELLES

I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you

alright?

AMY

What's going on, Tom?  What happened?

WELLES

I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I

can't.  You have to trust me...

AMY

Tom...

WELLES

It has to be this way for now.  It

won't be long.

AMY

Why haven't you called?  Why don't

you answer your phone?

WELLES

I don't know.  I'm sorry...

AMY

You're sorry?  What was I supposed

to think?

AMY

You owe me an explanation.  You

can't treat me like this.

WELLES

I wanted to call.  I couldn't.

AMY

You couldn't?

WELLES

You don't understand...

AMY

No, I don't, because you're not

telling me anything!

WELLES

I was in hell.  If I called you...

if I heard your voice... it would

have been so easy for me to quit.

I couldn't do that.

AMY

You should have.

WELLES

Amy, I'm not going to let anything

happen to us.

AMY

Look where we are.  Look at

yourself.  You son of a bitch,

you don't have any idea what

you're putting me through...

WELLES

I don't know what to say

AMY

You're killing me...

WELLES

Don't...

AMY

What was I supposed to think

happened to you?!

WELLES

Amy...

WELLES

Forgive me.

WELLES

We have to stay here a few days.

I'll get more clothing from the

house if I can.  I'm sorry.

(pause)

We're going to be okay.

AMY

Who are you calling?

WELLES

Mrs. Christian.

AMY

What?

WELLES

She's all I've got.  She's the only

witness.

AMY

Tom... she's dead.

AMY

She died in her sleep three days

ago.  It was in the paper...

WELLES

I just talked to her.

AMY

How could you not know?

AMY

Promise you'll stay.

WELLES

Promise you won't go back there,

wherever you were.  Whatever it was,

forget it.

AMY

Promise me.

WELLES

I promise.

Celebrity Films.

"

WELLES

Hello, Eddie.

WELLES

Put your hands on your head.

WELLES

Put your hands behind your head,

lock your finger together, get down

on your knees.

WELLES

I owe you a few.

WELLES

Don't go anywhere.

EDDIE

I'm gonna kill you.

WELLES

Don't bore me with that bullshit.

EDDIE

How'd you find me here?

WELLES

Don't ask questions.

EDDIE

Fuck you!

WELLES

Starting to recognize a pattern?

EDDIE

What do you want?

WELLES

Who is Machine?

EDDIE

I don't know...

WELLES

I want his name.

EDDIE

I told you, I don't know.

WELLES

I will never get tired of hurting

you, Eddie, so you might want to

change your attitude.

EDDIE

What the fuck am I gonna protect

that freak for?  He was Dino's boy,

not mine.  He shows up with his mask

on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody

knows.

WELLES

Okay, we'll come back to that.  So,

six years ago a guy contacts you,

through the classifieds, over the

phone, however he does it.  It's

Longdale, looking for a snuff film.

And you, entrepreneur that you are,

tell him you can hook him up.

EDDIE

Yeah, the fucking lawyer.

WELLES

Told him you could get him a snuff

film.

EDDIE

Yeah.

WELLES

How much did he pay you?

EDDIE

Thirty thousand each, that fucking

cocksucker.

WELLES

That's all?  Thirty each.  That's

all it took for you to murder her?

EDDIE

It was a lot of fucking money.

WELLES

So... you brought Dino in, and he

brought Machine.  And, one day, a

girl walked into your office because

you had an ad in the paper for

models.  And she never walked out.

EDDIE

Something like that.

WELLES

What did you do, knock her out,

shoot her up... ?

EDDIE

What the fuck do you want from me?

WELLES

I want to know.  I want to know

exactly what you did to her!

EDDIE

Fuck you then, you want to know?  I

talked her up, told her how

beautiful she was, told her she was

gonna be a star.  I told her I was

gonna get her a screen test, and

while I'm doing that, I got her a

soda and dropped a mickey.  When it

was dark enough, I rang Dino and

told him it was go time, I put her

in the trunk of my car and we went

and we fucking did it.  That's what

happened.  She's dead.  She's been

dead a long fucking time.  Nobody

fucking cares!

EDDIE

You wanted to know, now you know.

EDDIE

That's right, motherfucker, cut me

loose.  Be a man.

WELLES

Show me!

WELLES

Show me where you did it, on the

map, exactly where you did it.

EDDIE

Why?

WELLES

Because we're going there.

Big Bear Motor Lodge.

"

EDDIE

What are we doing here?

WELLES

That night... you didn't have to be

in the room, but you were.

(looks to Eddie)

Why?  Why did you watch?

EDDIE

I don't know.  I felt like it.  I

never saw anyone get done before.

WELLES

You enjoy it?

EDDIE

Made me sick, but what did I care?

What did I care if some hump wants

to beat off to that.  It was just

something I was doing for money.

WELLES

Tell me what happened.

EDDIE

What do you want to know?  You saw

it, you saw the loop...

WELLES

Nobody saw you bring her in?

EDDIE

There wasn't nobody around.  This

place was a shit-hole.  I backed up

the car to the door and we carried

her in, like groceries.  Dino made

her eat a bunch of pills, we laid

out the plastic, put film in the

camera and Machine went to work.

WELLES

What did you do with her body?

EDDIE

Took it out the bathroom window.

Buried it in the woods.

WELLES

Show me.

EDDIE

What are you thinking you're gonna

do... ?

WELLES

Keep moving.

EDDIE

Where do you think you're taking

this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero,

avenge that little girl's death?

Gonna make everything right with the

world?  How you gonna do that... ?

EDDIE

You can't go to the cops.  All you

can do is cut me loose and walk

away, because you got nothing...

WELLES

Stop talking.

EDDIE

You got absolute zero.

WELLES

Show me where you buried her.

EDDIE

I don't know...

(nods to forest)

... out there somewhere.

WELLES

Where?  Show me where.

EDDIE

I fucking don't know.  What do you

think... we weren't burying

treasure.  We didn't pace it out so

we could come back and get it.  We

dug a hole and we put her in it.

Your guess is as good as mine.

EDDIE

You'll never find her.  Nobody ever

will, and even if they did, it

doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the

cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em

all.  Without the film, it never

happened.  Don't you get it?  It's

over.  You can't do anything.

WELLES

I can kill you.  I can leave you out

here, just like you left her.

EDDIE

Do it.

WELLES

Don't think I won't.

EDDIE

Do it!  Put me out of my misery so

I don't have to listen to you

whining anymore.  You think it's so

easy?

WELLES

Easy enough for you.

EDDIE

I never killed anyone.

WELLES

That's right, you just stood there

and watched, because you "felt like

it."  Almost makes you worse.

EDDIE

What do you want?  You want me to

fall to my knees and start crying

like a baby... ?

EDDIE

Where you going?  You're the one

with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless

enough?  Come on...

EDDIE

Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with

that gun, your gun, right,

registered in your name?  Dig the

hole yourself, with your bare hands,

bury the body with your bullets in

it.  Fucking do it!

EDDIE

You pussy.

EDDIE

Fucking pussy!

MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)

(from phone)

Hello... ?

WELLES

(into phone)

Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you

remember, I was there a few weeks

ago... asking about your daughter...

MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)

(from phone)

I remember.  You just left...

WELLES

(into phone)

I have to tell you something.  It

won't be easy for you to hear.  It's

about your daughter... Mary Anne...

(struggling)

When I... when I was there with you,

her diary, in your attic, in

silverware.  If you read it, you'll

know what I'm telling you is true...

MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)

What are you talking about... ?

WELLES

She went to California, to Los

Angeles... she wanted to start over.

She wanted to be an actress...

MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)

What... ?

WELLES

Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead.

She's dead.

MRS MATHEWS

Who is this... ?

WELLES

Someone... some men, they took your

daughter and they drugged her, and

they took her to a motel room...

throat and he raped her...

out in the forest somewhere and they

buried her...

MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)

Why... why are you doing this to

me... ?

They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm

sorry.  It happened a month after

she ran away.  She's been dead all

this time...

WELLES

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there

wasn't anything anyone could do...

Hello, can you connect me with the

duty nurse?

(waits)

Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson

down here in the Thirteenth

Precinct.  I've got a helluva

problem I was hoping you could give

me a hand with.  We had a stabbing

incident a couple of days ago, and

it looks like the supposed victim

gave us a false name and address.

Can you tell me if you had an adult

male with an abdominal wound in you

ER in the last forty-eight hours?

(listens)

You'd remember this guy; a body-

builder, real big guy, five foot

eleven, with acne all over his chest

and back...

(listens)

Alright, thanks for your help.

... guy sticks out like a sore

thumb.  Five foot ten or eleven,

body-builder, bad acne...

(listen)

Okay, thanks anyway.

DISSOLVE TO:

WELLES (O.S.)

... abdominal wound.  You'd know him

if you saw him...

WELLES

(into phone)

He's a body-builder, stands just

under six feet...

WELLES

(into phone)

That's right... covered in acne.

That's him, that's the guy.  Listen,

we, uh... we think he filed a bogus

report on this stabbing, gave us a

false name and address...

(listens)

Yes, I'll hold.

WELLES

(into phone)

Yes... yes.

Hello?!  Amy?

AMY

Tom?!

AMY

How much forgiveness do you think I

have in me?

WELLES

I can't talk about it yet... not

yet.

WELLES

Why... why... ?

AMY

Tom... ?

WELLES

I have to tell you... I have to tell

you what happened.  I have to tell

you everything, but we can't tell

anyone else.  No one else can ever

know.

WELLES

You're all I've got.  You're all

I've ever had.

(pause)

You're the only one who can save me.
