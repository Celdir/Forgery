VOICE

Ready?

SECOND VOICE (LENNY)

Yeah.  Boot it.

OUR VOICE

Okay.  It's goin'.  I'm recording.

LANE

Good one, dickhead.  Thanks for

waitin' till I get this fuckin thing

on.  You tryin' ta I.D. me, or

what?

LANE

Next alley... just pull in slow.

(turning to us)

Hurry up will ya.  Here.

LANE

Let's go.

OUR VOICE

(shouting, edgy)

Don't move, don't talk, don't do

nothing.

LANE

Don't stop!

CUT TO:

LENNY

This is great... the doors are all

locked.  Who are these losers,

friends of yours?

CUT TO:

LENNY (V.O.)

Wow... the gas tank is a nice touch.

Oh, oh, end of the line boys.

LANE

Come on!  Fucking jump man!

CUT TO:

LENNY

Goddamnit!  You know I don't deal in

snuff.  How many times I hafta tell

you?!

TICK

Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.

LENNY

Well you could've at least warned

me.  You know I hate the zap... when

they die.  It just brings down your

whole day.  Jeez, Tick.

TICK

Sorry.

LENNY

How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't

the cops put it in evidence?

TICK

With all the blood I guess they

didn't see the rig.  Guy had it

under a wig.

LENNY

Yeah, but how'd it get to you?

TICK

I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.

(off Lenny's impatient

look)

Okay, okay... I got a deal with some

a the paramedics.  My guy pages me

and I pick it up at the morgue.  So

whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be

worth at least a grand.  Right?

LENNY

Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I

don't deal this kind of product, you

know that.  I'll give you four for

it, cause I've gotta cut off the

last bit.  And my customers want

uncut.

TICK

Fuck that!  The last part's the

best.  You dry-dive six stories and

blammo!  Jack right into the Big

Black.

LENNY

I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's

policy.  I got ethics here.

TICK

Yeah, when did that start?  Come on,

man!  It's what people want to see,

and you know it.

LENNY

So lay it off to somebody else.

TICK

Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I

got to get this rig fixed.  Look at

it...

TICK

Give me six at least.  This's a good

clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.

LENNY

Yeah, well, the first part's okay.

Better than the usual soaps you

bring me.

TICK

Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always

bring you choice.

LENNY

Sure, like this low-grade shit here,

some girl in a fight with her

boyfriend... it's a test-pattern.

Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.

TICK

Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me

real life.  Bring me street life.

And, like, one man's mundane and

desperate existence is another man's

Technicolor.'

LENNY

I said that?  Look, I'll take it for

five, and you'll make out okay,

because in this case it's pure

cream, you don't have to cut

anything back to the wearer.

TICK

Ha!  That's for fucking sure.

LENNY

What else you got?

CUT TO:

LENNY

Look, Jerr.  I'm nothing if not a

man of my word.  I'll drop the money

by tomorrow, next day latest.  It's

a little crazed right now.  Yeah, on

my mother's eyes, I swear.  Thanks,

buddy.

(hangs up)

Prick.

(to the car ahead

honking)

What kinda move you call that?!

Lemmings.

TALK-RADIO HOST

... it's a little after 2 am on

December 30th, 1999... the second to

last day of the whole darn century,

and the phone lines are open.  Dan

from Silverlake, you're on the air.

DAN FROM SILVERLAKE

Uh, hi.

HOST

So Dan, are you looking forward to

the New Year?

DAN

Not really.  I mean what's the

point?  Nothing changes New Years

day.  The economy sucks, gas is over

three bucks a gallon, fifth grade

kids are shooting each other at

recess... the whole thing sucks,

right?  So what the hell are we

celebrating?

HOST

You're a glass-is-half-empty kind of

guy, aren't you Dan?  Well I for one

happen to think that us making it

2000 years is worth celebrating--

LENNY

(on cellular)

Jimbo.  I'm there, Jimmy.  Right now,

can't you hear me knockin'?

LENNY

-- so you line up the talent, shoot

the clip, get it to me by Monday.

OK?  Client wants a guy and two

girls, the guy wears... yeah, I

know, thinks he's being original.

Girls have to be young.  So don't

use your mother like you usually do.

Yeah, you too, pendejo.  And no big

tits... French tits.  That's it...

like Champagne glasses... you got

it.  What a pro.  Page me.

LORI

If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd

know that there won't be another

thousand years.  Right now we are in

the Last Days, as foretold in the

book of--

HOST

The Last Days?  You mean the coming

of the Apocalypse, right?  The

Rapture?

LORI

Yes, that's right.  You only have to

look at the signs... there are wars

and rumors of wars--

LENNY

(lying)

I live here.

HOST

Now just so the rest of us know how

much time is left, when is the

Rapture supposed to hit, exactly?

Is it midnight New Year's Eve?

HOST

Is that midnight LA time, or Eastern

Standard or what?  I mean, what time

zone is God in, anyway?

LORI

I pray for you all.

LENNY

(cellular)

I just got something in, Bobby, you

might appreciate.  A 211 at a Thai

joint goes south, and these three

scuzzballs end up in a gun-and-run.

It's a beauty, two thumbs up.

Parental discretion advised.  I'm

talking it's the master, not some

stepped-on copy.  One of a kind.

LENNY

Yo, Skinner.  The Skin Man.

(fingering his

jacket)

Red leather.  Nice feminine touch.

SKINNER

(laughing)

Fuck you, Nero.

LENNY

Whattya got for me?

LENNY

Yeah, I can use this...

(to the stoned girl)

... but honey you gotta move your

eyes slower next time.  It's too

jerky.

SKINNER

It was her first time, Lenny.  Cut

her some slack.

HOST

Go ahead, caller, you're on the air.

VOICE

My name's DeWayne, and I got a New

Year's resolution for the po-lice.

Hey, yo Five Oh, you better get down

with 2-K.

HOST

2-K?  What's that DeWayne?

DEWAYNE

2-K.  The big two thousand.  Comin

tomorrow night.  Out with the old

and in wit da new.  See for the Man,

no new is good new, what I'm sayin.

He like to keep it the way it is.

But we going to take it, make it

new, make it our own.  History gonna

start right here, right now--

LENNY

Hi, Dave, this is Lenny.

(pause)

Nero.  Lenny Nero.  That's right.

Oh, is it late?  Sorry.  It's just

that I have something that might be

of interest, and since I always call

you first--

(pause)

Uh, huh.  Well, what would be a good

time?  Okay, sure.  Catch you then.

CUT TO:

EDUARDO

Let me get this straight... you

gonna pay me 200 bucks to put on a

hair net and bang some beautiful

babe.  I don't know, I gotta think

about this.

LENNY

Okay, let's get you wired up.  I

hope this axle grease you got in

your hair doesn't screw up the squid

receptors.

EDUARDO

What's all this squid shit?

LENNY

Superconducting QUantum Interference

Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's

gonna be a test.

EDUARDO

Hey, fuck you, man.

LENNY

Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a

sense of humor at all times.  Okay,

the receptor rig... what I'm putting

on your head... sends a signal to

the recorder.

(Lenny holds up the

recorder)

See we call it "being wired," but

there's no wire.  You gotta keep the

recorder close... five, six feet

away max, like in your jacket pocket

by the bed or wherever you're going

to close escrow, know what I mean?

EDUARDO

Yeah, right.

LENNY

Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes

around.  Don't look in the mirror or

you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a

half hour of tape, so give me some

lead-in to the main event.  But

don't wait too long, I don't want to

be going out for popcorn.  And don't

act natural.  Don't act at all.

Just forget the thing is on.  Got

it?

EDUARDO

No problem.

LENNY

A star is born.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ENGELMAN

She's a hooker, vice'll have her in

the book.  We can pick her up later.

SPREG

No.  Now.

CUT TO:

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

Do you request back-up?

SPREG

Negative.  Suspect is a black male,

age 35 to 40.  We're handling it.

ENGELMAN

FREEZE!

ENGELMAN

Oh shit.

CUT TO:

IRIS (V.O.)

Lenny, goddamn it, you got to be

there, you got to help me, come on,

pick up, pick up...

CUT TO:

IRIS

... you got to be there for me...

COME ON!  Shit, I'll call later.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FAITH

(laughs)

Hey, you going to watch or you going

to do?

LENNY

Watch and see.

FAITH

I love your eyes, Lenny.

(she touches our

eyelids)

I love the way they see.

CUT TO:

ANCHORWOMAN

... bodies of two men found early

this morning under the Hollywood

freeway have been identified as rap

star Jeriko One and bandmember James

Polton, known to fans as "Replay".

A third body, that of a woman, has

not yet been identified.  With his

band, the Prophets of Rage, Jeriko

One's outspoken political stance

and violent lyrics have stirred

nationwide controversy...

CUT TO:

LENNY

(on cellular)

You know I can get you anything you

want, anytime you want it, just not

right now.  We'll hook up at the

club later.  Around eleven.  Yeah.

CUT TO:

BARTENDER

Hey, Lenny.

LENNY

Anything without an umbrella.

FABRIZIO

Lenny my man, I think you want to

meet a friend of mine.

LENNY

Looks like money to me.

FABRIZIO

Don't forget your friends.

LENNY

10 percent, Fabri, like always.

FABRI

Keith, this is Lenny.  Guy I was

telling you about.  He can get you

anything you--

LENNY

(cutting him off)

Just a second.  Not to be rude,

Keith, but I got to ask, are you a

cop?

KEITH

I understand.  No, I'm not.

LENNY

You understand?  Attorney!  Right?

Am I right?

KEITH

That's right.

LENNY

Tassel shoes.  Entertainment law,

would be my guess.

(off the guy's scowl)

Relax.  I just like to guess, is

all.  It's my job to know people and

what they want... what's behind

their eyes.

FABRIZIO

Lenny gives people their heart's

desire.  Ain't that right, Lenny?

LENNY

That's right.  My second question I

gotta ask, so we get our bearings

here... have you ever jacket in?

Have you ever wiretripped?

KEITH

No.

LENNY

(a winning grin)

A virgin brain!  Well we're going to

start you off right.  So what do you

know about this?  Save us some

time...

KEITH

(shrugs)

Just what I've read.  That the

technology was developed for the

Feds, to replace the body wire.  And

now it's gone black market.  So, uh,

do I get the deck from you?

LENNY

I'll set you up, get you a deck at

my cost... since my thing is the

software.

KEITH

Clips.

LENNY

That's right.  Clips.

(Lenny leans in,

working the guy)

Look, I want you to know what we're

talking about here.  This isn't like

TV only better.  This is life.  It's

a piece of somebody's life.  Pure

and uncut, straight from the

cerebral cortex.  You're there.

You're doing it, seeing it, hearing

it... feeling it.

KEITH

What kind of things exactly?

LENNY

Exactly anything.  Whatever you

want.  Whoever you want to be.

(handing Fabrizio a

twenty)

Fabri, get us another round, would

you.

LENNY

You want to go skiing without

leaving your den, you can.  But I'm

assuming a guy like you, you wanna

go skiing you fly to Aspen.  That's

not what you're interested in here.

It's about the stuff you can't

have... right?  The forbidden

fruit.

LENNY

Like running into a liquor store

with a .357 magnum in your hand,

feeling the adrenalin pumping

through your veins.  Or...

(pointing discreetly)

... see that guy, with the drop-dead

Philipino girl friend?

(Keith looks)

Wouldn't you like to be that guy for

twenty minutes?  The right twenty

minutes.  I can make it happen.  And

you won't even tarnish your wedding

ring.

KEITH

(hooked like a carp)

Sounds good.

LENNY

I can get you what you want.  You

just have to talk to me.  I'm your

priest, your shrink, your main

connection to the switchboard of

souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa

Claus of the Subconscious.  You say

it, you even think it, you can have

it.  You want a girl, you want two

girls?  I don't know what your thing

is or what you're curious about...

you want a guy?  You want to be a

girl... see what that feels like?

You want a nun to tie you up?  It's

all doable.

KEITH

(flushed, sweating,

ready)

Talk to me about costs, here.

LENNY

Listen, before we get into numbers,

I want you to try a taste.  I got a

deck with me.

KEITH

What?  Right Here?

LENNY

(grinning)

Step into my office.

CUT TO:

LENNY

You were just an eighteen year old

girl taking a shower.  Are you

beginning to see the possibilities

here?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MAN (MAX)

Where is he?

CUT TO:

KEITH

Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get

someplace a little less public?

LENNY

(grinning)

You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops

have more to worry about in this

city than the squid-trade, believe

me--

MAN (MAX)

Don't move!  That's it, assume the

position you miserable techno-perv

puke.

MAN

(to Keith)

Beat it fuckwad.

MAN (MAX)

Gotcha.

LENNY

Damnit, Max, I was with a client!

You think that's funny?  To mess

with a man's livelihood?  It's not

funny!

MAX

You see the look on that preppy

puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his

Topsiders.

LENNY

(laughing a little)

Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me

money.

MAX

Come on, amigo, the world's full of

marks.  And nobody knows how to work

'em like you do, pal.  You could

sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a

wedding ring!  Let me buy you a

drink.

LENNY

Least you can do.

REGULAR

Yo, Pelcher!  Mad Max!

MAX

Fuckin' A right I'm mad!  I might

kill every man in here.  But first

I'm buyin' my buddy here a drink.

(seeing another

regular)

Hey O'Neal!  You were right, your

wife does give good head.

MAX

Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor!

Double shots.  Make it Tres

Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the

best for my good friend Lenny, the

finest cop that ever got thrown off

the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.

LENNY

Thanks, Max.

MAX

D'you always have to dress like a

fuckin' pimp?

LENNY

This tie cost more than your entire

wardrobe.

MAX

That's not sayin' much.

LENNY

It's the one thing that stands

between me and the jungle.

MAX

To the jungle!  Where outa the blue

some shitbird can cap you in the

back of the head and ruin your whole

day.

LENNY

You were lucky, Max.

MAX

Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with

a .22-short floating in my brainpan,

and a cop pension I can't live off

of.  Good thing I wasn't any

luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter

right here!

MAX

You seen Faith lately?

LENNY

Naw.  She won't call me.

MAX

Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get

past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by

far the most outstanding woman a guy

like you could ever hope to get, I

mean it's completely and deeply

humiliating that she's gone, but

it's over, campadre.

LENNY

Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your

concern.

MAX

I just hate to see you pining away.

It makes me want to vomit, frankly.

(philosophically)

Broken hearts are for assholes.

LENNY

(seeing Iris)

Hey, Iris, you okay?

IRIS

Lenny, I got to talk to you, it's

serious...

MAX

(looking at her face)

What happened, honey, some john get

rough on you?

IRIS

(to Lenny)

I mean talk private.  Please, I'm in

trouble, and so is Faith.

MAX

(as Lenny reacts to

the name)

There it is, the magic fuckin' word.

IRIS

Can we go to your car?  There's

something you have to see right

away.

LENNY

What's going on?

CUT TO:

IRIS

It's a bad situation... if they get

me I know they're going to -- OH

SHIT!

LENNY

Hang on, that's my car--

TOW DRIVER

Not anymore.  Belongs to the bank.

LENNY

Hey wait a second...

LENNY

Oh, yeah, that's the answer!  Two

million years of human evolution and

that's the best idea you can come up

with?

(driver continues

with the hoist)

Okay.  Look, whattya get to repo a

car?  Two hundred?  Two fifty?  I'll

pay you three fifty, right now.  All

you gotta do is drop it off the hook

and say you came by, your mark

wasn't here.  Simple.  Make a few

bucks.  Do a good deed.  Huh?

DRIVER

You got the cash on you?

LENNY

I was going to write you a check, if

that's--

LENNY

Okay, okay, I totally respect that

call.  I would want cash.  They'll

take my check inside... I can see

you're pressed for time, just give

me two minutes... here keep my watch

for collateral.

LENNY

It's a Rolex.  Be right back.  Two

minutes.

LENNY

Son of a bitch!

CUT TO:

MACE

Hello?  Hey Lenny, whatup?

(listens a beat;

then)

Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Sure.  So what

happened to your car this time?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MAX

See, if you packed your piece you

could've made the guy see sense.

LENNY

Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the

line of a fine jacket.

MAX

An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's

embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen

with you.

(as she slips up

behind them)

Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?

MACE

Greetings, gents.

(to Lenny)

So let's hear this week's sad story.

LENNY

They jerked my wheels, d'you believe

it?  I mean it's outrageous, the

computer errors the banks are making

lately.  Have you noticed?

MACE

No.  I haven't noticed because I

make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher,

how's the P.I. business?

MAX

Sucks.

(attention caught by

TV)

Hey, Bobby, turn that up.

JERIKO ONE (ON T.V.)

The LAPD is a military force turned

against its own people.  We live in

a police state!  The mayor and the

city council sit up in their offices

with their social programs that

don't work... they're rearranging

deck chairs on the Titanic.  But the

new day is coming!  Two-K is coming!

The day of reckoning is upon us.

History ends and begins again right

here!  Right now!

MAX

To the end of all things!

(slugs down the shot)

You know how I know it's the end of

the world?  Because everything's

been done, every kind of music's

been tried, every government's been

tried, every fuckin' hairstyle.

How you gonna make it another

thousand years, for Chrissake?

MAX

I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used

it all up--

LENNY

(riveted to the TV)

Shutup a second!

MACE

Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?

MAX

Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.

(to screen)

Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden

goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer

guy.

MACE

But I mean isn't he Faith's new--

(she mouths the word

"boyfriend")

MAX

Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You

may trigger a maudlin display which

will force us to tranquilize him.

REPORTER

The LAPD have said they believe

this is a gang-related incident.

Can you comment on that, Mr. Vo?

TRAN

We have no facts yet.  All we know

for sure is that we have lost a

great artist, that a great voice for

change is now silent...

LENNY

Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just

have a few stops, mostly on the west

side--

MACE

Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd

drop you home, but I'm not taking

you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've

already pulled twelve hours today.

LENNY

(upbeat again)

Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a

big night.  Can't you feel it?  The

energy in the air?  There's money to

be made, dreams to sell.

MACE

Sleaze to peddle.

LENNY

Just a couple of hours.  It'll be

fun--

MACE

Excuse me.  What part of NO don't

you understand?

LENNY

Mace, you're my friend.  I need you.

Plus I'll give you 25% of what I

make tonight.

MACE

Lenny, this may be a hard concept

for you, but friends don't have to

pay their friends.

MACE

Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got

a pickup at the St. James.  I'll

take you there, you can get a cab.

LENNY

(an arm around her

like a buddy)

Mace!  You're a life-saver.

MACE

(resigned)

Driving Mr. Lenny.

CUT TO:

MACE

So, what's up with you?  Another

busy night selling porno to

wireheads?

LENNY

No, wrong... I sell experiences.

Sex is only part of it.

MACE

Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.

LENNY

Way I look at it, I actually perform

a humanitarian service.  I save

lives.

MACE

Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.

LENNY

Okay, take some executive... bored

with his life, bored with his

wife... he picks up a hooker or some

girl at a bar.  Then he goes around

for months, torn up worrying that

he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his

wife.  And maybe he really does

catch something--

MACE

Price he pays for being a

scumsucking pig.

LENNY

Everybody needs to take a walk to

the dark end of the street sometime,

it's what we are.  But now the risks

are outa line.  The streets are a

war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So

you slip on the trodes, you get what

you need and it keeps you from

jumping your tracks.

MACE

Lenny, this shit's illegal.

LENNY

Define illegal.

MACE

Me bailing your sorry pale ass out

of jail twice in the last six

months.

LENNY

(kidding)

Yeah, but that was for love.

MACE

Define love.

CUT TO:

MACE

Dammit, Lenny, you made me late.

LENNY

What's his name?

MACE

Fumitsu.

LENNY

Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir,

Leonard Nero, Security Express.

Lornette Mason here is just

completing our routine driver

evaluation.  We do it to make sure

that out VIP clients, such as

yourself, are always treated as

honored guests.  I just need to ride

up front and take some notes, if you

don't mind.

MACE

Um, excuse me.

(can't stand to say

it)

Sir.  Excuse me.  Mr. Nero.

MACE

(hissing through her

teeth)

What the fuck are you doing?

LENNY

(winning smile,

innocent)

Coming with you.

MACE

You will not live to see the

morning.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

STRICKLAND

Nero.

LENNY

(uh-oh)

Strickland.

STRICKLAND

Commissioner Strickland.

LENNY

Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you

shitcanned my career, I don't even

have to call you sir.  One of life's

small pleasures.

STRICKLAND

Aren't you peddling your wares a

little far from your usual gutter?

LENNY

I was invited here by a close

friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right

over there.

STRICKLAND

I don't like disappointments, Nero.

And do you know what disappoints me

very much?

LENNY

Your sex life?

STRICKLAND

Your existence.

CUT TO:

MACE

Now listen to me... you have to get

to bed young man.  I mean it.  No

watching "Tales from the Crypt".  I

don't care what Cecile says.  I'll

see you in the morning, baby.

Night, night.

MACE

Are we having a bad night?

LENNY

(glancing back)

Let's talk in the car.

CUT TO:

FAITH

I feel like you're turning me into a

VCR.

LENNY

I just want to see what we're like

together through your eyes.

FAITH

I don't feel anything.  Is it on?

LENNY

Forget it's there.

FAITH

Make me forget it, baby.

LENNY

Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is

Armani.

(he looks at her)

You angry?

MACE

I've had enough of this shit.

(getting back into

the car)

You're on foot, Lenny.

LENNY

In LA?  Are you crazy?

LENNY

(as they drive along)

Can I come in please?  I'm having a

hard time hearing the stereo.

LENNY

I need my case.  It's still in the

back.

MACE

Get it.

LENNY

Listen, can we talk a little bit

here, like two rational adults?

LENNY

That would be no.

MACE

I've had it.  No more wirehead shit

in my car.  You understand?  You

want to poach your lobes, do it

somewhere else.

LENNY

Okay, you got my attention, but this

is cutting off the circulation to my

head, here.  D'you mind?

LENNY

I thought we were friends.

MACE

No, see a friend is more than one

person constantly doing favors for

another.  You just suck people along

with your schemes and your scams and

your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I

got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex-

husband someplace who doesn't send

me a dime of support... I'm just

trying to hold on here.

LENNY

So am I.  Just trying to get by.

MACE

No, you're just trying to get off.

LENNY

Macey... I've never seen you like

this.

MACE

Lenny, you're turning into some

kinda squid-head low-life.  You're

always broke, you just go from one

score to the next.  And you're

getting strung out... you don't even

see it.  Getting high on your own

supply like some crack dealer.

LENNY

I know you wouldn't be saying all

this if you didn't care about me.

Thanks, Mace.  Really.

MACE

Look, I gotta get some sleep.

LENNY

You still like me, don't you?  We're

still buddies?

MACE

(a tiny smile)

Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.

LENNY

Macey, I know you're tired, but can

you drop me at the Retinal Fetish?

It's on your way.

MACE

Jesus, Lenny.

LENNY

Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic

behavior at all?  Will that help?

Faith's there tonight, and I've got

to talk to her.

MACE

Sure, Lenny.

(she puts the car in

gear)

The only thing worse than a junkie

is someone in love.

CUT TO:

LENNY

Come on, let me buy you a drink.

Let's drink and make up.

(Mace shakes her

head)

Alright, I'm going to see Faith.

That means you can watch me suffer.

I'll be in agony, you'll feel so

much better.  Total and thorough

payback, whatdya say?

CUT TO:

LENNY

Who's the new side of beef in Tran's

posse?

MACE

Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a

running back for the Rams in '96 and

'97.

LENNY

Rams... that's football, right?

MACE

Forget her.

LENNY

She still loves me.

MACE

She thinks you're a bucket of dog

vomit.  Trust me on this.

LENNY

She's my destiny.

MACE

Destiny?  You living in a perfume

commercial?  She's a hard-climber

that dropped you like a used tampon

when she got a better ride.

LENNY

You'll see.

TRAN

You come to peddle me some tapes,

Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a

couple bucks for the holidays?

LENNY

You're not a client anymore, Tran.

I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a

dead dog's balls.

TRAN

(glancing at Faith,

back at Lenny)

I already got everything I need from

you.

FAITH

Cut it out, Tran.

LENNY

Too bad about your guy Jeriko.

Tough break.

TRAN

Show a little respect, Nero.  The

man was an important artist.

LENNY

Yeah, important for your label.

Which no doubt is why you're in

mourning.  Don't worry, his

records'll sell out now he's dead.

You'll make out.

TRAN

I always do.

LENNY

Faith, can I talk to you a second?

FAITH

I don't think that's a good idea,

Lenny.

LENNY

I just got to talk to you for one

second.

TRAN

About what?

LENNY

That would be between me and Faith,

wouldn't it?

TRAN

I don't feel anything between you.

See, your trouble is you assume too

much, Lenny.  You assume there's

something where there's nothing.

You assume you have a life.  But

you're only hustling pieces of other

lives on tape, and broken parts of

your own.

FAITH

(icy)

We have nothing to talk about,

Lenny.

TRAN

Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely

to his car.

LENNY

Faith, call me, okay?

FAITH

No, Lenny.

LENNY

Tick, listen, I can't stop right

now.  but I'll call you tomorrow

about that thing we were talking

about.

TRAN

Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of

stolen dreams.

FAITH

Leave him alone, Tran.

TRAN

He's no concern of mine, as long as

you don't talk to him.  Don't talk

to anybody.  You understand?  Not

with everything that's going on

right now.

FAITH

You're too goddamned paranoid.

TRAN

Paranoia's only reality on a finer

scale.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LENNY

So, those rascals still haven't

grown back yet, huh?

TEX

(peering under the

blanket on his lap)

Nope.  Guess not.  Any day now,

though.

LENNY

(handing Tex a Squid)

Present.  Something I had made.  Let

me know what you think.

TEX

Hey, alright.  Got something here

for you, too.

(passes him an

envelope)

It just showed up tonight, don't

know who left it.

LENNY

Fan mail from some flounder?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LENNY

Hi, baby.  I've missed you.

FAITH

I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you

talking to me he'll hurt you.

LENNY

I'm already hurting.

FAITH

You have to go.  I mean it.

LENNY

Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just

answer one question.  Is anything

wrong?  Iris said you might be in

trouble.

FAITH

(startled, turning

to him)

You talked to Iris?  When?

LENNY

Tonight.

FAITH

Well I haven't seen her in months.

Who knows what's going on in her

head.  You're really running out of

excuses to come around, aren't you?

LENNY

I know you Faith.  You're afraid of

something.  What's going on?

FAITH

Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take

care of itself.

LENNY

It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is

poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's

got you walled in on all sides.  And

he uses the wire too much, he gets

off on tape, not on you.

FAITH

That's a good one, coming from you.

LENNY

Why don't you just split?  You don't

love him, anybody can see that.  And

to him you're just some kinda

possession, like a Ferrari,

something to show the other guys.

FAITH

He has his uses too.

LENNY

What?  He gonna record you on his

label?

FAITH

Maybe.

LENNY

Come on, Faith!  He's just toying

with you.  And when he gets bored,

you'll be yesterday's papers.

LENNY

Look, baby, I've watched you create

yourself out of nothing.  You're

like a goddamn cruise missile,

targeted on making it.  And you

will.

FAITH

Damn right.

LENNY

It's you up on that stage, not him.

You don't need him.

FAITH

You have to get out of here.  If

Tran catches you he'll... he's

acting crazy.  He's doing way too

much playback and he's getting

completely paranoid.  He's such a

control freak, he's even paying Max

to follow me around.

LENNY

Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?

FAITH

Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny,

just stay away from Tran, okay?  And

stay away from me.  Stop trying to

rescue me.  Those days are over.

I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to

save me, okay, because I don't need

saving... Just... give up on me.

LENNY

Can't do it.

FAITH

You know one of the ways movies

still have Squid beat?  Because they

always say "The End." You always

know when it's over.  It's over!

Now please leave.  I have to go on

again in a couple of minutes.

FAITH

Hell.

CUT TO:

LENNY

Shoulda told me about your new gig,

buddy.

MAX

I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just

a job.  I feel like shit about it.

LENNY

You should feel like shit.

MAX

I figured, what the hell, I could

take the prick's money and make sure

Faith was OK at the same time.  Do

us both good.  Right?

LENNY

Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for

you.

(already over it)

Hey, at least you got a job!

(slaps him on the

back)

Watch her for me.  Stay on her.

MAX

I'm on her.

LENNY

Can I get that?

MACE

Hey Lenny, where the hell are you, I

think Tran's got Beemer looking for

you.

LENNY

Thanks for the tip.

CUT TO:

LENNY

I recognize you.  You're Wade

Beemer.  Running back for the Rams,

am I right?

BEEMER

Yeah, that's right.

LENNY

I saw you play, man.  You were good.

Like a fucking freight train I

remember saying.  So what happened,

injuries or what?

BEEMER

Bullshit politics.

LENNY

It's always politics.  Like this

thing we're in here, he's paying you

to tune me up, right?  But I could

pay you more not to.  See what I

mean?  I could write you a check

right now--

BEEMER

Come on, let's go, I got to get

back.

LENNY

(pulling money out

of his pocket)

Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's

everything I have on me, what do you

say?  How about a Rolex?

BEEMER

(barely a glance at

it)

I already got a real one.  Come on,

it won't be too bad.  It's not

personal.

LENNY

(taking off the

Armani carefully)

Just not the eyes.

CUT TO:

LENNY

They oughta get some lights back

there.  A person could get killed

slipping on those stairs.  Let's go.

CUT TO:

MACE

You're some piece of work, you know

that.  Just calmly backstroking

around in the big toilet bowl, and

somehow you never let it touch you.

I mean, between Vice and this so-

called occupation you're in now, you

must've seen it all.

LENNY

I have crawled through the gutter...

through every wrinkle in the human

brain.

MACE

What I'm saying.  But you still come

out this goofball romantic.

LENNY

It is my sword and my shield, Macey.

MACE

What's that?  Present from Faith?

LENNY

No idea.

LENNY

It's a test pattern so far.

LENNY

Alright, a little B&E action.

LENNY

Hey, getting good.  Solid suspense

build.

MACE

What is it?

LENNY

Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT

NOW!  Just go!  GO!

IRIS

(voice distorted)

I haven't seen your face... I

haven't heard your voice... you can

still let me go...

LENNY

Holy shit.  He's jacking her in to

his own output.  She's seeing what

he's seeing.  She's seeing herself.

LENNY

(like a mantra)

On my God.  Oh my God.

MACE

My God, Lenny.  What is it?

LENNY

Black.  Jack.

MACE

Blackjack?  I don't understand--

LENNY

Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said

she needed my help and I... aw

Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker

killed her.

MACE

Are you sure it's real?

CUT TO:

MAX

Ohhhh shit.

MAX

Well... I've lost my appetite.

(lofts it into a

nearby dumpster)

For about a year.

MACE

No way.

MAX

You alright?  Y'okay?

LENNY

Yeah.  No, not really.

MAX

Let's work it.

LENNY

Not now... I don't want to think

about it--

MAX

Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good

at this stuff.  Play it down.

What's the perp doing?

LENNY

He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then

he does her...

MAX

And he records it.  Thrill kill.

Wants to see it again.  And again.

LENNY

He records himself raping and

killing her--

MAX

But at the same time he's sending

the signal to her--

LENNY

So she feels... what he feels...

while he's in her.  The thrill while

he's killing her... is sent to her,

heightening her fear... which in

turn heightens the turn on for him.

(turns to him)

I've seen a lot, Max.

MAX

So've I.  Too much.

LENNY

But this is a bad one.

MAX

Top ten.

LENNY

He makes her see her own death,

feeds off the reaction... killer and

victim merging... orgasm and agony

merging.  And he records it all.

MACE

And gives it to you.

LENNY

Wants to share.

MAX

That's right.  He wants to share.

Needs an audience.  This is one sick

puppy.

LENNY

Why me?

MACE

Cause you're the man, right?  The

Magic Man.  If it's got something to

do with the wire, sooner or later it

washes up on your beach.

LENNY

I've never dealt in black-jacks.

Never.  Everybody knows that.

MAX

He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying

to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing

you to do something.

MACE

Maybe he just figures Lenny will

appreciate what he's created.  It's

the dark end of the street, Lenny.

How do you like it now?

LENNY

Jesus, Mace.  Back off.

MACE

This guy is someone you know, one of

your squid-head contacts.

MAX

Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.

MACE

Take the tape to the cops.

LENNY

Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.

MACE

So some psycho wire-freak gets to

keep running around--

MAX

Naw, he's right.  They'll figure

Lenny's the perp, or go through his

client list, ruin his life... such

as it is.  Look, I'll call the guys

in Homicide... tell them she was a

friend of mine and they'll keep me

in the loop.  Get me the forensics

and all that.

(he opens his car

door)

Get some sleep.  I'll call you when

I get something.

(he starts his car)

And Lenny... I'd keep moving if I

were you.

CUT TO:

FAITH

(whispering, furtive)

You're crazier than I thought,

Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just

in there.

LENNY

Iris is dead.  She was murdered.

FAITH

Who did it?

LENNY

Don't know.  But this guy's real

damaged goods.  Iris knew someone

was after her... and she said you

were in danger too.

(he grabs her

shoulders)

Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever

you're hiding, whatever's going on,

you have to get out of here now.

Come with me right now.  Don't even

think about it.

FAITH

Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You

going to protect me?  Big tough guy.

You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't

even have a gun.

LENNY

(hurt)

I have a gun.  It's under my bed.

FAITH

You don't know what you're fucking

with here.

LENNY

Tell me.

TRAN

Go ahead, Faith.  Tell him.

FAITH

Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to

give me some bad news.  An old

friend of mine has been murdered.

You remember Iris?

TRAN

A tragic story, no doubt.

(to Lenny)

How'd you get up here?

LENNY

Charm.

TRAN

(looks at Faith)

Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you

an offer.

(he grabs Faith by

the arm, steps

closer)

Take her.  Right now.  If she wants

to go, if she's unhappy here, she

can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith

always knows what she wants.

(he turns her loose)

Hands off.  See?

LENNY

It's alright.  He means it.

TRAN

(to Faith)

I do mean it.

(to Lenny)

And I mean this... if Faith stays

you go away and never come back.

You scuttle back into your cockroach

hole and never cross my vision

again.  You understand?

FAITH

I made my choice, Lenny.

TRAN

(to Lenny, nodding

toward the elevator)

You're going down.

FAITH

I don't love you, Lenny.  Give up.

CUT TO:

FAITH

You said you were going to get her

out of this.

TRAN

Maybe now you appreciate the danger

we're in.

(he moves very close)

It was touching the way you stood by

me in there.  "Stand by your man".

I was moved.  You were very good.  I

don't think he even understands that

you did it for him.

FAITH

He doesn't know what's going on.

Leave him alone.

TRAN

I'd love to.  But he keeps showing

up.  And you keep talking to him.  I

can't have that--

TRAN

The only time a whore should open

her mouth is when she's giving head.

FAITH

Fuck you.

TRAN

(walking away)

Maybe later.

CUT TO:

LENNY

(speed-rap)

Listen, can we be smart here?  I

could make it really worth your

while... I could cut you a check for

500 each... hell, make it an even

grand... I'm not saying you don't

land a couple shots, just go light

is all I'm saying... here, take my

Rolex.

CORTO

Lemme see.

CORTO

We tried to find a smaller girl, to

beat the shit out of you, Lenny...

but it was short notice.

MACE

Safety's on.

MACE

Lenny!

CUT TO:

LENNY

Is this great fabric or what?

MACE

You ever wonder why you get beat up

a lot?

LENNY

Never really thought about it.

CUT TO:

LENNY (V.O.)

Come on... look in the mirror.  You

know it's there, you're keeping your

eyes off it, you bastard... SHIT!

Who are you?

LENNY

He knows what he's doing.  He's worn

before... a lot.

MACE

So that gives you something.

LENNY

It gives me... I don't know... maybe

two hundred people who I know wear.

MACE

Don't crank the gain any more.

You're gonna fry yourself.

LENNY

I need to see more... get more

detail.  Something.  I feel his

presence, so strong...

MACE

No more, Lenny.

LENNY

Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.

LENNY

She came to me for help.  I should

have read it better... I just

figured, y'know... another strung-

out hooker having a bad night.

MACE

It's not your fault.

LENNY

Sex killers act alone.  So there's

no information on the street, which

is how cases get made.  Cops know

they'll never nail this guy the

second they look at the scene.

LENNY

And anyway, nobody gives a shit

about a dead hooker.  They're

roadkill.

LENNY

See, it's all about what they see

walking in.  A dead hooker,

handcuffs, penetration... they'll

see a trick gone wrong.  Random

kill.  The kind you never solve.

MACE

But that doesn't add, does it.

LENNY

No it doesn't.

MACE

Because Iris knew somebody was after

her.

LENNY

She said "If they get me".  They.

Which means the whole sex-killer

thing is a cover, which means

somebody whacked her for a reason.

MACE

So the guy's not a sicko.

LENNY

If he could do what's on that tape,

he's a sicko.

MACE

Okay, so he's a freak who thinks

he's sane pretending to be a freak.

The point is, he was a hitter.

Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But

why not just put a little lead in

her ear?

LENNY

Because it had to look random.  Not

connected to anything or anyone.

(he seems to run out

of energy)

But then why give the rape to me?

MACE

That's where it gets a little

strange.

LENNY

And what about the guy that was

following me?

MACE

Now you're really getting paranoid.

LENNY

The question is not whether I am

paranoid, but whether I am paranoid

enough.  You want to rub my neck?

MACE

Sure.

LENNY

How's Zander?

MACE

OK.  He asks about you all the time.

It's been weeks since you've seen

him.

MACE

I'm sorry about getting on your case

earlier.  I just see you getting

sucked in deeper and deeper, and I

-- anyway.  I'm sorry.

LENNY

(drifting off,

joking)

S'okay.  I know you still love me.

CUT TO:

ZANDER

Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a

guy?

MACE

Just Lenny.

ZANDER

Right.  That explains it.

MACE

Are you going to make me beg?

MACE

(looking at weird

stuff in cereal)

What is that?

ZANDER

Cheerios and wieners.  I made it

myself.  It's good.

MACE

Well give me some then... I'm

starving.

CUT TO:

MAX (V.O.)

Hey, the last day of the world and

you spend it in bed.

LENNY

W'sup, Max?

CUT TO:

MAX

Not a whole hell of a lot.  They've

just been saying words over Jeriko.

Tensions running pretty high down

here.  I'm telling you.

LENNY (V.O.)

Faith OK?

MAX

Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I

got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris

checked into the Sheraton last night

under a false name.  Paid cash.

LENNY

Looks like she was holding out.

MAX

Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in

on Tran last night.  Another slick

Lenny move.

LENNY (V.O.)

He's in this somehow... I don't know

how.  Just stay close to Faith.

MAX

I'm on her, amigo.  No worries.

Gotta jam.

CUT TO:

MACE

Whatup Lenny?

LENNY

(hands shaking)

Jesus, Mace!

CUT TO:

MACE

Where we going?

LENNY

Anywhere.

(finger to his lips)

We'll talk about it in the car.

LENNY

Hand me that box of tapes, will you?

MACE

What is it?

LENNY

This tie doesn't go with blue!

CUT TO:

POOR MAN

... the New Years Eve mega-bash of

the century.  Ten square blocks of

madness, with live music, fireworks

and the actual rich and famous of LA

hobnobbing with us peons.  Also

yours truly the Poor Man will be

there at the KROQ bandshell, giving

away "Millennium LA" and "KROQ 2-K"

T-shirts by the truckload--

MACE

Will you relax.  There's nobody back

there.

LENNY

Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my

throat.  In my living room.

Relaxing might be right out, okay?!

MACE

You better keep a low profile for a

while.

LENNY

No shit.  You got someplace in mind?

CUT TO:

ZANDER

What do you got?

LENNY

(pulls a tape out of

his pocket)

Today I have...

MACE

(seeing the tape)

Lenny, have you lost it completely?

LENNY

Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is

audio only.

(hands tape to

Zander)

John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme."

Give it a listen, let me know what

you think, maybe you won't go for it

now, but it'll get in your head and

grow like a seed into something

really beautiful.

ZANDER

Let's play it now!

LENNY

Later.  Your mom'n I are heading

right back out.

CECILE

Hey, come on, I been baby-sitting a

full 24 hours, I have to get ready

for the party tonight...

MACE

Cecile.

MACE

(to a disappointed

Zander)

You're not the only little boy I

have to look out for, honey.

CUT TO:

TICK

Whoa.  That is one unbelievable

piece of eyefuck.

LENNY

Skip the art criticism, Tick, what

can you tell me about the wearer.

TICK

Well... the guy's fucked up.

MACE

We know that, Tick.

TICK

No, I mean the killer's got some

kind of distortion in his visual

cortex.  The color and gray-scale

values are all messed up, like color

blindness.

TICK

Lookit, you see the peak period

ratios there?  Could be some kind of

tumor or brain lesion or something.

Some kind of trauma

(shaking his head)

This is not good.  I don't like this

at all...

LENNY

What?

TICK

Well, it's cutting awful close to

me.  I mean she was just here.

LENNY

Who was just here?

TICK

Iris, man.  Pay attention.

LENNY

Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris

was here?!

TICK

Yeah, she came by last night.

Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to

make a copy of some clip.

LENNY

What clip?  What was it?

TICK

I don't know, man, she wouldn't let

me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to

see it.  She said she was going to

give it to you to hold for her.

Like insurance or somethin'

LENNY

She never gave me a tape.

MACE

(to Lenny)

Think back about what she said.

Exactly what she said.

LENNY

(revved up)

She wanted to go out to my car,

something about my car...

MACE

Something in your car...

CUT TO:

LENNY

That's a handy little attitude

adjuster.

(sees his car)

Damn.  I'm boxed in.

MACE

What's it say?

LENNY

Nothing.  Let's go play this back.

SPREG

Give me the tape.  Right now.

LENNY

What tape?  I'm just trying to get

my car back but the place is

closed--

SPREG

Shut the fuck up Nero.

MACE

(cool and even)

Lenny, give them the tape.

LENNY

It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going

to open my case...

ENGELMAN

Facing us, where we can see it.

LENNY

Take it and turn her loose.  Okay?

SPREG

Absolutely.

CUT TO:

LENNY

(holding on)

Oh no, we're not being followed,

Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny.

LENNY

Shit!

MACE

Take it easy.  The glass is bullet

resistant.

LENNY

Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened

to bullet proof?

MACE

Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I

do.

CUT TO:

LENNY

Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!

MACE

It's okay, Lenny

(he looks at her

hopefully)

They'd never get here in time

anyway.

MACE

(matter-of-fact)

This is bad.

LENNY

The gas tank's going to go any

second!

LENNY

Are you out of your fucking mind?!

MACE

Fire's out, isn't it?

MACE

Get in here.  Come on Lenny, move

it.  MOVE!!

MACE

Get ready to hold your breath.

MACE

Lenny, kick out hard, then just

follow me. Okay?

SPREG

Let's get out of here.

MACE

I can't believe we had to give them

the damn tape.

LENNY

Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my

favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot

tub on my birthday.  I'm going to

really miss it.

LENNY

Are we impressed yet?

CUT TO:

CURTIS

(pissed)

I got better things to do on New

Year's Eve than be some kinda damn

chauffeur...

MACE

Hey Curtis?  Just drive.

LENNY

Those two guys were cops.

MACE

You sure?

LENNY

It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway,

they'll run your plates and get your

address.  We gotta keep moving.

CUT TO:

CECILE

Lornette, girl... what's going on?

MACE

(to Zander)

We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey.

We're going to watch fireworks from

there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.

ZANDER

Aw, Mom!

LENNY

Come on Zander.  You can ride on my

shoulders.  Here you go.

MACE

Cecile, get in the car.  Now.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ONE OF THE BOYS

Yo, Mace.  Whatup wit you, homegirl?

You never come roun' here no more.

MACE

He's with me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MACE

Tell me.

LENNY

I can't tell you.  You've got to

see.

MACE

Uh unh.  I won't do it.

LENNY

Mace.  I know what you think about

the wire.  But I'm asking you to do

this.  It's that important.

LENNY

Sorry this has to be your first

playback.

LENNY

Keep your eyes closed, or you'll see

double.

JERIKO

Shit.  Fuckin' Five-O

COP VOICE

(on bullhorn)

Go to the bottom of the ramp.

JERIKO

(jumping out of the

car)

Goddamn, now what you pull me over

for?  If I was going any slower I'd

be parked--

COP VOICE 1

Get down on your knees and put your

hands on your head.  Now!

COP VOICE 2

Everyone else, out of the car and

down on the ground.

COP VOICE 1

Put your hands behind your head

right now!

ENGELMAN

(to us)

Put your hands on the hood of the

car and don't move.

JERIKO

I suppose you stopped us cause you

had suspects fitting our description

in the area, what you're gonna tell

me.  What was the description?  Two

black males in a car?  Yeah, right,

I heard that one before...

JERIKO

Well you stopped the wrong black

male tonight officer... what is it?

Spreg.  Officer Spreg.  Cause I'm

the 800 pound gorilla in your mist,

fucker.  I make more in a day than

you make in a year, and my lawyers

love to spend my money dragging

sorry-ass Aryan robocops like you

into court.  Get a man down on the

ground with no probable cause.  Fuck

you!

SPREG

Shut the fuck up!

DIAMANDA

(yelling)

Leave the fuck off of us, we weren't

doing anything...

SPREG

Shut up!  Don't make me walk over

there.

SPREG

You're that rap puke?  Jeriko One?

You're the one getting all the

gangbangers to form citizens groups

and go downtown... trying to rake

the LAPD over a cheese grater?

JERIKO

That's right.  And you're gonna be

in my next song, motherfucker, it's

called Robo-Spreg.

JERIKO

It's a song about a cop who meets

his worst nightmare, a nigger with

enough political juice to crush his

ass like a stink bug.  You're gonna

be famous.

SPREG

I don't think so.

SPREG

(shouting)

Hey... I don't hear you laughing!

SPREG

Get the bitches.

LENNY

(into phone)

Hang on.  Hang on, Max.

(looks at Mace)

You see?

MACE

I see.

(trembling)

I see the earth opening up and

swallowing us all.

LENNY

Yeah I know.

(into cellular)

So what do we do?

CUT TO:

MAX

(into phone)

Don't talk to anybody.  Anybody.

You're invisible.  Okay?  Just meet

me at Tick's in a half hour.  And

Lenny... don't get pulled over.

CUT TO:

LENNY

We got to make another copy of this.

Little life insurance.

MACE

You know what this tape could do if it

gets out.

LENNY

(tucking Glock in

his waistband)

I've got a good idea, yeah.

MACE

People finding out... seeing... that

the LAPD just flat out executed

Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they

ought to see.

LENNY

Maybe.  But tonight is probably not

the best night.  Come on, we're

rollin'.

CUT TO:

CECILE

Lornette, when you gonna stop laying

off everything on me?  We had plans

tonight--

MACE

(steely)

Listen to me, little sister.

There's something going on, and it's

very big.  Now you've got to take

care of Zander.  And stay off the

streets tonight... you hear me on

this?

MACE

Curtis.  What about you?  Do we

understand each other?  You stay

put.

CURTIS

Yeah.  I'm wit it.

CURTIS

(to Cecile)

Damn!  She worse than you.

CUT TO:

LENNY

So, let's see, I've got Tran's

goons, some squidhead psycho and the

LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy

new year, Lenny.

MACE

Well, look at the plus side.

LENNY

There's a plus side?

MACE

Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape

to save me.  That's real progress

for you.

LENNY

It was a tough call.

MACE

I still can't square the psycho

smarts of whoever did Iris with

those two cops.

LENNY

I don't think those cops did Iris.

I think whoever Iris was wearing for

killed her.

MACE

Why?

LENNY

To break the trail.  If those cops

had gotten hold of her, they would

have beat it out of her who she was

wearing for, and then gone after

them too.  Our killer is running as

scared as we are.  Which makes him

really dangerous.  Judging by how

scared I am.

CUT TO:

MAX

Sounds like Tick's already

celebrating.

LENNY

You may be a little overdressed for

this party.

(Lenny pounds on the

van door)

Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!

LENNY

(knocks again, then opens

rear van door)

Tick, I got to talk to you, man...

oh shit.

LENNY

(as he starts to

examine Tick)

He's been cooked-off

MAX

Is he dead?

LENNY

No.  But his frontal lobes are like

two runny eggs.  They put an

amplifier in-line to boost the

signal till it french-fried his

brain.

LENNY

He's totally cut off from the outer

world.

MACE

How long does it last?

(off Lenny's look)

Oh.

MAX

Those two psycho cops are on a

slash-and-burn to find the tape and

cover their tracks.

MACE

This seems a little sophisticated

for them.  These are not subtle

guys.

MAX

There's more to this whole thing

than you think.

LENNY

Whattya mean?

MAX

All I'm saying... you don't know how

high up the food chain this thing

goes.  I've heard stuff.

LENNY

What stuff?

MAX

Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff

about a death squad.  A group a guys

loyal to the hardline school.  Guys

that've had too many years of city

hall and the review boards and the

goddamn media pissing down their

necks, suspending cops right and

left, tying their hands... while

outa the other side a their mouths

these same people're squealing save

us, save us, do something you

fucking morons, crime is totally out

of control.

LENNY

Jesus.

MAX

Yeah.  So don't walk near me in

public, alright.

LENNY

Thanks, buddy.  See... things

weren't bad enough.  They weren't

fucking bad enough!

MACE

The only card we have to play is the

tape.  You know, we get it to the

media somehow...

LENNY

Yeah, right, blow it open.

MAX

(interrupting)

Mace... no disrespect... but you run

this on the 11 o'clock news, by

midnight you got the biggest riot in

history.  They'll see the fucking

smoke from Canada.

LENNY

Okay... what about Strickland?

MAX

No.  Bad idea.

MACE

Who's Strickland?

LENNY

Deputy Commissioner Palmer

Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick

who busted me out.  His ass is so

tight when he farts only dogs can

hear it.  I know this guy.  If

there's one cop who's not dirty

it's him.

MAX

Listen to me, Lenny... stay away

from cops.  All cops.  You have no

way of knowing who you can trust.

MACE

So you're saying we just pretend is

didn't happen?  It happened!  The

LAPD executed one of the most

important black men in America!  Who

the fuck are you to bury this?!

MAX

Fine.  Do you want blood running

waist deep in the storm drains?  The

gangbangers'll spread like a wave

through this city and burn it to the

ground.  And when the fires start

the street cops'll be capping off at

anything that moves.  It'll be all-

out war and you know it.

MACE

Yeah, well maybe it's time for a

war!

MAX

You really want that on your head?

LENNY

Hey, Max, Mace... whoa... time out.

MAX/MACE

(together/annoyed)

What!?

LENNY

Whoever killed Iris did Tick.  It's

the same sick wirehead shit.  Same

reason... to burn the trail.  If

Faith knows anything about this, and

I think she does, then she's on the

list.  So... who's driving?

CUT TO:

FAITH

Lenny!  Jesus!  You scared the Hell

out of me.

FAITH

What's going on?

LENNY

Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris

made me a copy of the tape.

FAITH

Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep

you out of this.

LENNY

How did it happen?  What was Iris

doing riding around with Jeriko

wearing a wire?

FAITH

We should talk alone.

LENNY

No.  Mace is in this.

MACE

Tell us.

FAITH

Tran's gotten obsesses with

playback, a total wiretrip junkie.

And he's such a control freak, he's

been having people followed,

videotaped... recording his business

partners' calls.  Wiring up people

left and right.

CUT TO:

TRAN

Let's go get her.  We're late.

MAX

Tran, listen.  I was wondering how

you want me to work it tonight, down

at the Bonaventure.  You want me

downstairs at the party or upstairs

at the suite?  Where you going to

be, mostly?

CUT TO:

FAITH

Tran and Jeriko weren't getting

along.  He was afraid Jeriko was

getting ready to dump him, but he

wasn't sure, so he started with the

surveillance.  A couple nights ago

he wires up Iris and sends her and

the other girl, Diamanda, over to

Jeriko's table.

FAITH

That night Iris calls up, freaking.

She comes over and Tran watches the

tape.  He just loses it.  He can't

believe the disaster she's gotten

him into.  He's terrified the cops

will beat it out of her who she was

working for, and come looking for

him.

LENNY

Kinda guy you can count on in a

pinch.

MACE

Why didn't he just go public with

the tape?  Save himself that way.

FAITH

The scandal would wipe him out.  If

it got out that he had his own

artists under surveillance... he'd

lose all his other acts.  He'd be

over.

FAITH

So finally he gives Iris some cash

and tells her to check into the

hotel under a wrong name till he

figures out what to do.

LENNY

Yeah... he figured out what to do

all right.

FAITH

You think Tran killed her?

LENNY

The killer knew right where she was.

Because he put her there.

FAITH

What a nightmare.

CUT TO:

TRAN

Go get her, Joey.  Stupid bitch.

(to Max)

We'll talk about this later.

CUT TO:

MACE

Come on.  We're out of here.

LENNY

Leave here with me, right now.

FAITH

Okay, Lenny.  My guardian angel.

CUT TO:

TEX

Teach you...

(pound)

to mess with...

(pound)

a helpless cripple!

CORTO

(to the others)

Not here.  Lets go.

CUT TO:

MAX

Everything's cool.  Too much to

drink.

MACE

Yeah, uh... he slipped on the

stairs.  We're taking him to

emergency.

(to the nearest cop)

Excuse me.

COP

Go to Cedars.  It's closest.

CUT TO:

FAITH

Well, I'm certainly in the mood for

a party.

TRAN

(to Wade)

Take her up to the suite.

(to Faith)

Have a glass of champagne... or

six... I'll be up in a while to help

you ring in the New Year.

FAITH

I live for the moment.

CUT TO:

MACE

You are a pussy-whipped sorry-ass

motherfucker, you know that?

LENNY

Owww!!  Take it easy.

(to phone)

Uh huh.  So where are they now?

CUT TO:

MAX

He's got her up in the room, under

guard.  And he's still working the

party... acting smooth like nothin's

nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work

a trade.

LENNY (V.O.)

What do you mean?

MAX

Give him the tape.  See?  It's

fucking brilliant!  The tape for

Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I

can set it up.

LENNY (V.O.)

This is what we laughingly refer to

as a plan, right?

MAX

Come on!  If he gives us any shit,

we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?

(same old Max)

Just get your butt down here.  If

I'm not at the shindig downstairs

go to the room.  It's 2203.  You

writin'?

CUT TO:

LENNY

2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.

MAX (V.O.)

I intend to.

LENNY

Okay, we gotta get over there.

(opens the bag)

Can you borrow a dress from Cecile

or something--

MACE

I'm not going.

LENNY

Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's

gonna do her right there unless--

MACE

Lenny... shutup.  Just park your

mouth and listen.  It's a set-up.

Think about it!  Why's he been

sending you tapes?  To freak you,

get you to rush in without thinking.

Then they put one in you, put one in

her, put the gun in your hand...

crime of passion.  This guy's bent

enough to think of that.

LENNY

That sounds right.

(but it changes

nothing)

I'm going.

MACE

You gonna get yourself killed for

this?  This toxic-waste bitch!

LENNY

What the fuck are you doing?!

MACE

Lenny!  This is your life, Lenny!

Right here.  Right now.  This is

realtime... not playback.  Real...

time.  Time to get real.  Understand

what I'm saying... she doesn't love

you.  Maybe she did once, I don't

know, but she doesn't now.  These

are used emotions.  It's time to

trade them in.

MACE

Lenny, memories were meant to fade.

They're designed that way for a

reason.

LENNY

Have you ever been in love with

somebody who didn't return that

love?

MACE

Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.

LENNY

It didn't stop you from loving them.

Right?  Or understanding them, or

being able to forgive them...

MACE

I guess.

LENNY

And it didn't stop you from wanting

to protect them.  Did it?

MACE

No.  It didn't.

LENNY

I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent

Crimes... and I saw every known

depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In

outer darkness.  Then I busted this

strung-out little teeny-hooker.

When I met Faith she was just

another runaway giving twenty dollar

blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost

soul.

MACE

You never told me.

LENNY

But she was different.  There was a

light in her eyes... and she had

this voice.  It was scary, all that

pain coming out of that little body.

Like she could take all the hurt and

rage of the entire world and lift it

up to heaven in one voice.  I helped

her.  And I promised her that I'd

always be there... to protect her.

(long pause)

See?  It's not about what's in her

head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't

let go of the promise.  It's...

like... it's all I have left.

MACE

No, it's not.

MACE

Come on, Lenny.  Let's go to a

party.

CUT TO:

MACE

That's it.  Let's bail.

LENNY

Mace... you're a girl.

MACE

Good, Lenny.  I can see why the

detective gig didn't work out.  Come

on.

LENNY

Got your ticket?

MACE

No.  They must have sent it to my

beach house by mistake.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LENNY

You see Tran?

MACE

Uh unh.

LENNY

(to the ringing

phone)

Come on, Max.  Come on, buddy...

(two more rings)

Damnit.

LENNY

Alright.  We're going up.

MACE

And do what?  Take on his whole

posse?

LENNY

I still got one ace to play.  Tran's

got what I want... and I've got what

he wants...

MACE

That's the original.  There are no

copies.

LENNY

(not getting it)

Exactly.  That's why it's a make-

able deal.

MACE

Look.  That tape is a lightning bolt

from God.  It's worth more than you,

more than me, more than Faith.  You

understand?  It can change things.

Things that need changing before we

all go off the end of the road.  And

you do not have the right to use it

for currency.

(Lenny's eyes are

wide)

You go... you go alone.  This is

where I draw the line.  I care about

you Lenny... a lot more than you

know... which makes us both pretty

stupid.  But you pawn that tape, you

mean nothing to me.

MACE

Ah, hell.  Lenny--

LENNY

See that guy?

(pointing)

The one with the ramrod up his ass.

That's Strickland.

LENNY

Take it to him.

MACE

A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!

LENNY

No.  Trust me.

MACE

(nodding slowly)

Oh boy.

(she takes a deep

breath)

What if you're wrong?

LENNY

Then we'll be right where we are

now.

MACE

Yeah, right.  Fucked.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

STRICKLAND

Yes?

MACE

There's a tape in there you need to

see.  I mean right now.

STRICKLAND

If it wasn't New Year's Eve, I'd

arrest you for possession of illegal

equipment--

MACE

(interrupting)

Just look at the tape!  You want to

know who killed Jeriko One?  Go in

the stall right now and hit Play.

YOUNG COP

Sir, is there a problem here?

MACE

Damn!  I knew it--

CUT TO:

LENNY

Now, Wade, can we talk here, like

two human beings--

LENNY

It's not personal.

CUT TO:

CORTO

Aw, not the fucking nose!!

VITA

Hey, enjoy the party.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

FAITH

Oh.  I didn't hear you come in.

LENNY

No, no, no...

FAITH

I love you.

TRAN

You're going to die, you're both

going to fucking die.

MAX

This piece of puke hired me to kill

you, baby.  Do you believe that?

Isn't that right, Tran?  You

pinhead.

FAITH

Oh my God.  I don't believe this is

happening.

MAX

Believe it.  Now bring me the

trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.

FAITH

What're you going to do?

FAITH

You can't just... kill him.

MAX

I'm not.  Just a little poach job.

FAITH

Jesus.

MAX

Hey, he was going to kill you.  And

this ratfuck paid to have Iris

killed, to save his own sorry ass.

MAX

You shut the fuck up, right now,

I'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger!

MAX

Look, baby, it's now of never... the

guy is a known input junkie, so a

little OD won't surprise anybody.

It's the only way we can be

together.  You know it's true.

FAITH

My God.

MAX

Here's how much I love you, baby.

MAX

Don't make any assumptions about our

friendship, Lenny.

LENNY

No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know

you were colorblind, Max.

MAX

Only way I could stand your ties.

MAX

I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.

LENNY

Where's Faith?

MAX

I sent her to the party.  I figured

I'd wait up here until you killed

Tran.

LENNY

What makes you think I'm gonna kill

Tran?

MAX

You just did.

LENNY

Jesus!

MAX

You know, statistically that's the

second most common word people say

right before they die.  Shit being

number one.

LENNY

So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran

in, being on his payroll, and shot

me.

MAX

That's pretty much the way it

happened.

LENNY

Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering.

I killed Iris too, didn't I?

MAX

That's right.  They'll find the

original of her snuff clip in your

apartment.  The one I left for you

at the club was a copy.

LENNY

Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do

Tick too?

MAX

You bet.  Did you like it?

LENNY

So why Max... why d'ya have to do

Iris?  She never hurt anybody.

MAX

Picture it... I feel like I gotta

share this with somebody.  It's too

perfect.

LENNY

I won't say anything.

MAX

I know.  So, I'm working for this

puke, right?  And he says he'll pay

me quite large to do the hooker.

But also I gotta do his bitch

girlfriend cause she knows the whole

score and she's totally out of

control.

MAX

Only he doesn't know about me and

Faith.  So I say to myself, if I

turn the job down, he just gets

somebody else.  And I lose Faith...

to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I

do the skank.  I still gotta do

something about Tran... I figure

it's him or me... but I can't cap

him without a chump to take the

fall.  And who better than his

girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a

known criminal... who has been seen

hassling them in public numerous

times.

LENNY

And who was, regrettably, also your

best fucking friend.

MAX

No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey,

cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten

minutes anyway.

LENNY

You must be so pleased, I followed

your jellybean trail right here,

like a good little chump.

MAX

You got froggy on me a couple times.

MAX (V.O.)

I thought that riff about the Death

Squad was pretty good.  I hadda keep

you from bringing the cops into it.

LENNY

So there never was a death squad.

MAX

Naawww.

LENNY

Just those two loose-cannon cops

running around covering their butts.

MAX

Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this

shit caused by a random traffic

stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing.

You know that.  Look around... the

whole planet's in total chaos.  You

gotta take what you can, while you

can.  Cause some shitbird can come

up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back

a your head any second.

LENNY

How did you hook up with Faith?

MAX

This dink hires me a month ago to

eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows

me from you, right, so she comes up

to me and says, 'Hey Max why you

following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you

a drink and explain.' And she says...

FAITH

'So, do you enjoy watching me?'

MAX

You were supposed to go downstairs,

baby.

FAITH

I know.  I don't always do exactly

what I'm told.

(she walks slowly

toward them)

So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching

me?'  And you said -- come on Max.

MAX

I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for

free.'

FAITH

Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good,

because I like the feeling of

someone watching me.  I acquired

the taste from Lenny.'

MAX

(to Lenny)

And then she said, 'Since we're

going to be spending so much time

together--'

FAITH

'We might as well make the best of

it.'

LENNY

(crushed)

Jesus, Faith.

FAITH

Lenny!!

MAX

Fucking bitch!!

CUT TO:

MACE

All the way down!  RIGHT NOW!!

MACE

Wait.  Let me tell you what's going

on here--

MACE

NO!!  NO!!!

STRICKLAND

(to the nearest

officers)

These two are under arrest for

murder.

STRICKLAND

Get some medical attention for this

woman.

LENNY

Are you okay?

MACE

I got 'em, Lenny.

LENNY

SHOOT!

SPREG

YOU FUCKING NIGGER BITCH!!

LENNY

Yeah, what?

MACE

Are we under arrest?

LENNY

Naw.  They just have to ask us a

few questions... for about six

hours.

CROWD

TEN!  NINE!  EIGHT!...

CROWD

SEVEN!  SIX!  FIVE!...

CROWD

FOUR!  THREE!  TWO!  ONE!  HAPPY NEW

YEAR!

MACE

(grinning)

Hey, Lenny.  We made it.

LENNY

Yeah.  We did.

MACE

Well...

(she shrugs)

Get going.  You're still bleeding.

LENNY

See you downtown.

MACE

Yeah.  See you there.

THE END
