FRECKLED KID

Man, what's the matter with you?

FRECKLED KID (contid)

Dude.  Lighten up.  She's just a girl.

You just gotta-

SCOTT

No, my eyes... my eyes are killing me.

FRECKLED KID

You want some Visine, man?

SCOTT

My... eyes...

SCOTT

... they're burning...

FRECKLED KID

Dude, how much did you smoke?

SCOTT

I didn't smoke anything.

JEAN (O.S.)

In every organism on Earth there

exists a mutator gene - the X-factor,

as it has come to be known.  It is the

basic building block of evolution -

the reason we have evolved from homo

habilus...

JEAN (O.S.) (contid)

... to homo erectus, to homo sapiens

Neanderthals, and, finally, to homo

sapiens.

JEAN (O.S.) (contid)

Taking it's cues from the climate,

terrain, various sources of

nourishment, the mutator gene tells

the body when it needs to change to

adapt to a new environment.  The

process is subtle, normally taking

thousands of years.

JEAN (O.S.) (contid)

Only in the last few thousand years

did mankind begin to make clothes for

himself, build shelters, use heat and

grow food in large quantities.  With

this man-made environment remaining

relatively stable, the X-factor became

dormant.

JEAN (O.S.) (contid)

Until now.

JEAN (contid)

For reasons still not known to us, we

are seeing what some are calling the

beginnings of another stage of

evolution -

KELLY

You're avoiding the question I posed

to you at the beginning of the

hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are

mutants dangerous?

JEAN

I am avoiding a question that is

decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong

person behind the wheel of a car can

be dangerous.

SENATOR ROWEE

Well, we do license people to drive.

JEAN

But not to live.

KELLY

Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for

mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can

you tell the members of this committee

what exactly you are teaching these

mutants?

JEAN

Math.  History.  Science.  English.

Athletics --

KELLY

You wouldn't happen to be teaching

them how to use their powers to --

JEAN

Control, Senator...  we teach them

control.

KELLY

This was taken by a state police

officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A

man in a minor altercation literally

melted the car in front of him.  I

don't know where you come from, Ms.

Grey, but where I come from, you don't

go melting people's cars when they cut

you off.  You do it the old fashioned

way -- you give 'em the finger.

(laughs from the crowd)

But what you presume to tell this

committee -

JEAN

I presume nothing, I am here to tell

you that in time, the mutator gene

will activate in every living human

being on this planet.  Perhaps even

your children, Senator.

KELLY

I can assure you, there is no such

creature in my genes.

KELLY (contid)

Ms. Grey, we are not here to weed out

mutants.  The Registration Act is

designed merely to assess their

potential threat - if any - to

national security.

KELLY (contid)

Mutants are very real.  They are among

us.  We must know who they are.  And

above all, we must know what they can

do.

REPORTERS/VARIOUS

Dr. Grey, how do you feel about the

Senator's Statement / How is the

mutant community reacting?  Is it true

that mutants are dangerous? / Is there

a mutant plot to overthrow the

government?

JEAN

Weire not the ones to be afraid of.

SABRETOOTH

Itis not gonna be that easy.

PYRO

Hand me the dykes.

PYRO (contid)

I asked you not to do that.

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

Preparations are nearly completed for

the upcoming anniversary gala

celebrating the formation of the

United Nations.  With nearly every

invitation confirmed, the occasion

promises to be the largest single

gathering of world leaders in history.

NEWSCASTER (contid)

Ellis Island, once an arrival point

for thousands of immigrants crossing

the Atlantic with the hopes of a

better life, will open its doors

again.  Only this time it will be to

leaders and their families from over

200 nations.

INTERVIEWER

...and the leading voice in the call

for Mutant registration is Senator

Scott Frank Kelly, of Florida, who

claims to support the constitutional

rights of the genetically enhanced,

but whose crusade to register mutants

is gaining popularity.

MAGNETO

Not this one again.

MAGNETO (contid)

Your expression tells me the news is

not good, brother.

SABRETOOTH

I lost him.

MAGNETO

How?

SABRETOOTH

It was Xavieris people.  They knew.

MAGNETO

I want him.  That is all they know

because that is all you know.

KELLY

I think the Presidentis pre-occupation

with international affairs has drawn

his attention away from this problem.

Americanis deserve the right to decide

whether they want their children to be

in school with mutants.  To be taught

by mutants.  They also have the right

to know the dangers.  Thatis the

purpose of registration.  And mark my

words, if the President isnit strong

enough to do what needs to be done...

MAGNETO

And you may mark my words, Senator

Kelly.  All your plotting, all your

hatred.  I have plans for you.  Iive

seen you come, and I will see you go.

MAGNETO (contid)

Can it be..?

SABRETOOTH

Is that what youire looking for?

MAGNETO

A piece.  Only a piece.

SABRETOOTH

Is it enough?

MAGNETO

Enough for a test.

KELLY

I canit believe the President canit

see it.  I wouldnit be surprised if he

has a mutant on his staff.

GUYRICH

Have you thought of a demonstration of

some kind?  Maybe use the UN Summit to

our advantage.  The whole world will

be watching.

KELLY

Iim not interested in the whole world,

Henry... Iim interested in America.

Let the rest of the world deal with

mutants their own way.

GUYRICH

Where to?

KELLY

Home.

GUYRICH

Dulles Airport.

LOGAN

Where is it?

VOICE

... until the Emperor Constantine

converted to Christianity.  With that

one act, history was changed.  The

Christians who were once prosecuted

and fed to the lions, became accepted.

BEAST

So as their leaders went, so did

follow the hearts and minds of the

people of the Roman empire.  Which

made for some very happy Christians.

BEAST (contid)

Can I help you?

VOICE (O.S.)

Good morning, Logan.

XAVIER

Would you like some breakfast?

XAVIER (contid)

Iim sorry, allow me to formally

introduce myself -- I am Professor

Charles Xavier.  This is my school.

LOGAN

How do you know my name?

XAVIER

Youire not the only one with gifts.

LOGAN

What am I doing here?

XAVIER

I brought you here so that you would

be safe from Magneto.

LOGAN

Who?

XAVIER

A very powerful mutant who for some

reason has taken an interest in you.

Iim not sure why, but until we find

out, I must ask you to stay.

LOGAN

No thanks.

PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIERiS SCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED

Westchester N.Y.

KELLY

Where the hell are we?

GUYRICH

Pilot?

GUYRICH (contid)

Pilot?

KELLY

Dear God... Dear... God.

KELLY (contid)

What the hell is this?

KELLY

You... wha... Who are you... Where is

Henry?

MAGNETO

Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some

time Senator.

KELLY

You mutant bastards...

KELLY

Whatever you do to me... no matter

what youill make me right.  Every word

I have spoken will be confirmed.

MAGNETO

Gosh, I hope so.

KELLY

People like you are the reason people

like me exist.

MYSTIQUE

And people like you are the reason I

was afraid to go to school as a child.

MAGNETO

Are you a iGod-fearing man,i Senator?

MAGNETO (contid)

That term always confused me.  As if

there were something to fear.

MAGNETO (contid)

God after all, is often defined as all-

forgiving.  A description I rather

like.  I think what you really are

afraid of...

MAGNETO (contid)

...Is me and my kind.  The Brotherhood

of Mutants.

MAGNETO (contid)

And this law.  Your mutant

registration act is only the

beginning.

KELLY

The intention of registration act -

MAGNETO

INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We

are talking about mankind here.  His

fear.  It is only a matter of time

before mutants will be herded into

camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And

eventually wiped off the face of the

Earth.

MAGNETO (contid)

Well, weire much more giving than

that.  We simply want to share with

you... To help you understand.

KELLY

What is it you intend to do to me?

MAGNETO

(smiling)

Letis just say, God works too slowly.

MAGNETO (contid)

Youire a leader, Senator Kelly -- you

set an example.  And if more of you...

were like more of us?  Well, youill

see.

MAGNETO (contid)

Donit fear God, Senator.  And

certainly - most certainly... donit

fear me.

MAGNETO (contid)

Not any more.

SABRETOOTH

Weive found him.

MAGNETO

Where?

KELLY

Oh... Oh God... what have you done to

me?

MAGNETO

Welcome to the future... brother.

MAGNETO (contid)

Now if youill excuse me...  I have a

train to catch.

BRAD 1

Hey.

BRAD 1 (contid)

Hey... Hey Iim talking to you.

BRAD 2

(looking at her duffle bag)

Where are you going?

BRAD 1

Awww... look guys sheis shy.

BRAD 3

Maybe thatis why sheis alone.  Is that

why youire alone?

BRAD 4

Iill keep you company.

BRAD 4 (contid)

Hey...  Iim talking to you.

BRAD 4 (contid)

(louder)

I said Iim talking to you!

BRAD 4 (contid)

(louder still)

I said...!

BRAD 1

Hey, what did you do?

ROGUE

Donit touch me.

BRAD 3

Hey Brad, sheis a mutant!

LOGAN

How about you sit down and leave the

kid alone, alright?

BRAD 1

Sheis a mutant.

LOGAN

Yeah, well, nobodyis perfect.

BRAD 1

(who is considerably larger

than Logan)

I think you should take a seat little

fella.

LOGAN

Listen -- I donit want any trouble.

BRAD 1

Well you got trouble.

TRANSIT COP

Freeze... transit police.  Drop your

weapon.

MAGNETO

You can come out now, Logan.  Youire

among friends.

TRANSIT COP

Freeze!

MAGNETO

You Homo Sapiens and your guns.

XAVIER (O.S.)

Thatis enough, Max!

MAGNETO

Iill never understand your regard for

them, Charles.

XAVIER

And Iill never understand terrorists.

MAGNETO

I am trying to save our kind, Charles.

You should do the same.

XAVIER

Not at the cost of lives, Max.

MAGNETO

Magneto.

XAVIER

(to Cyclops)

Itis alright... itis alright.

MAGNETO

The two in Alaska.  Just how do you

people manage to be in the right place

at the right time?  Still tinkering

with Cerebro?

XAVIER

(referring to Logan)

What do you want with him?

MAGNETO

Canit read my mind?

MAGNETO (contid)

Iill tell you something, Charles, we

are more alike now than we were when

we started.

XAVIER

Is that so?

MAGNETO

Still trying to make the world safe

for our kind.  Still trying to find a

way to introduce ourselves --

definitively.

XAVIER

You definition of definitive was

always a bit extreme for me, Max.

What is it like these days?

MAGNETO

Letis just say that I am out to make

some radical changes.  Now come on

Charles.  For old times sake, for your

sake...  Leave him to me.

MAGNETO (contid)

Ahh... there you are brother.  I

believe you possess something I am

very much in need of.

TOAD

Do it again.

TOAD (contid)

Oh God it hurts.  Do it again.

PYRO

IiM BLIND.

MYSTIQUE

I have to go to the bathroom.

MAGNETO

If I could make you understand.  If

you could just be made to see it the

way I do.  The way itis going to be.

XAVIER

The way what is going to be?

MAGNETO

Iim going to change the world with or

without you as a witness, Charles.

(Points to Logan)

And this one gets a front row seat.

XAVIER

What do you mean to do?

MAGNETO

This checkmate goes to you.  I didnit

want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me

no choice.

XAVIER

WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?

XAVIER (contid)

Now will you come back with us?

LOGAN

Look, I appreciate your concern.  But,

I do better on my own.

XAVIER

You got less than sixty miles today.

Iill make you a deal.  Two days.

If we havenit figured out what Magneto

wants with you by then...  Iill bring

you back myself.

LOGAN

What are you going to do with her?

XAVIER

Rogue is a beautiful girl, with an

extraordinary power.  One that even

her own family isnit able to accept.

Sheis been on her own for weeks now,

searching for a home.  A place to

belong.

XAVIER (contid)

-- Weire going to give her that.

LOGAN

Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if

you cross me, I wonit feel any guilt

about what I do to you.

XAVIER

Deal.

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

Is there such a thing as too much

security?  A possible complication

adding to the United Nations

Anniversary is the sheer number of

security personnel for what will be

the largest single summit in the

history of the planet.

NEWSCASTER (V.O. CONTiD)

While the Secret Service has never had

difficulty handling one or even

several world leaders, it has never

had to handle the daunting task of

watching over all of them.

KELLY

What have you bastards done to me?

VOICE

HEY.

MAGNETO

How are we feeling today, Senator?

Advanced, I hope...

MAGNETO (contid)

I want him alive.

SABRETOOTH

Iill find him.

MAGNETO

ALIVE.

JEAN

Anything else I can get you?

LOGAN

Some cigars.  Case of beer.

JEAN

Thereis no smoking or drinking on the

school grounds.

LOGAN

I wonit light the cigars - how about

that?

JEAN

Iill see what I can do -- You should

get some sleep.  Even with your

healing ability, youire going to be

hurting for a while.

LOGAN

What if I like the pain?

JEAN

The Professor said you were a solider.

Actually, I believe he used the word

mercenary.

LOGAN

Yeah?  Well I donit like to talk about

my past.

JEAN

Maybe, the Professor could help you

with that.

LOGAN

By reading my thoughts?

JEAN

If necessary.

LOGAN

(smirks)

What if theyire naughty?

JEAN

Get some shut-eye, slick.

JEAN

Scott.. I -

CYCLOPS

I donit like him being here.

JEAN

What are you talking about?

CYCLOPS

You saw what happened tonight.  You

think Magneto wonit come after him

again.  You think he wonit come here

if necessary.  This is a school, for

Godis sake.

JEAN

If Magneto is planning to use Logan

for some terrible purpose itis our

responsibility to do something.

JEAN (contid)

Whatis wrong?  Thereis something else

bothering you.

CYCLOPS

I have a bad feeling about this.

JEAN

You know I love you, Scott.

I hope you donit mind.  I understand this

helps you relax.

- X

BEAST

Adamantium.  Until today I thought it

to be a myth.  Impenetrable,

unbendable, resistant to the most

extreme heat, cold, indestructible.

BEAST (CONT'D)

Itis been grafted to his entire

skeleton.

XAVIER

He also has accelerated healing

abilities - uncharted regenerative

capability, making his age impossible

to determine.  He could very well be

older than I am.

STORM

Is the Adamantium part of his

mutation?

XAVIER

No.  Someone put it there, relying on

his healing abilities to keep him

alive.

CYCLOPS

What do you think Magneto wants with

him?

XAVIER

Iim not entirely sure itis ihimi that

Magneto wants.

STORM

DONiT TOUCH HER.

CHILDiS VOICE

Mom, is that a mutant?

LOGAN

Why is everybody up at sunrise?

STORM

The sun is setting, Logan.  Youive

been asleep for nineteen hours.

LOGAN

What did she do to me?

STORM

She borrowed your power to save her

life.  When she touches someone, she

absorbs their strengths -- their

gifts.  In your case -- your ability

to heal.  Thatis why she keeps her

body covered.

LOGAN

I felt like she almost killed me.

STORM

If she held on any longer she could

have.

LOGAN

And you think it helps calling her

Rogue?

STORM

Weive learned to embrace what we are

rather than hide it like an

affliction.  For some, it has become

their identity.  You mock the names

these people choose but they wear them

as badges of pride.

LOGAN

Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?

CYCLOPS (O.S.)

I wanted to talk to you.

CYCLOPS (contid)

Storm, would you excuse us please?

STORM

Of course.

CYCLOPS

Letis take a walk.

CYCLOPS

How long have you been in Alaska?

LOGAN

I donit remember.  Is that what you

wanted to ask me?

CYCLOPS

I just wanted to make you clear on

something.  Personally, I donit care

what Magneto wants with you.  He can

take those claws of yours and use them

for Barbecue skewers.  What I do care

about is the safety of this group.

The Professor is in charge, and after

the Professor, thereis me.  So, for

the remainder of your time here,

youire going to keep that killer

instinct of yours locked down so no

one else gets hurt.

LOGAN

(smirks)

Iive served with men like you before.

Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You

know what happens to those men in a

real fight?

CYCLOPS

You know, you --

LOGAN

Shut up.  I got no interest in you,

Xavier,

(he points mockingly at the

Xis on Cyclopsi uniform)

or your... X-Men.

LOGAN (contid)

And I donit think this has anything to

do with my ikiller instinct.i  You

just donit like the way Iim looking at

your girl -- Or maybe you donit like

the way sheis looking back.  And maybe

you think youire man enough to do

something about it.

LOGAN (contid)

Cimon sport.  You think you can blow

the meat off my bones before I gut

you?  Letis find out.

XAVIER (O.S.)

Cyclops!

LOGAN

I have a question for you, Chuck.

Whatis the point?

XAVIER

The point of what?

LOGAN

This.  This whole God damn thing.

(derisively, at Cyclops)

Making yourselves into some sort of

iteami of super-powered freaks.

Teaching wayward mutants about

classical literature.  For what?

XAVIER

The point is to step into a more

evolved position of social

responsibility.  To recognize that

there is a world out there and that we

mutants are as much a part of it as

normal human beings.

LOGAN

What if it never happens?  What if

theyire so afraid of us that we become

the enemy? -- This place is gonna be

one giant cemetery.

XAVIER

Now thatis Magneto talking.

LOGAN

No.  Thatis me talking.  And you know

what?  Itis only been thirty-two hours

and you still have no idea what this

guy wants with me.

XAVIER

I believe he wants you for your

Adamantium.

XAVIER (contid)

Youire thinking of your dog tag.  It

was made of Adamantium wasnit it?

JEAN (O.S.)

Professor.

XAVIER

What is it?

JEAN

Rogueis missing.

LOGAN

Where are we going?

XAVIER

To find Rogue.

LOGAN

How?

XAVIER

The brainwaves of mutants are quite

different than those of the average

human being.

XAVIER (contid)

Cerebro amplifies my power.  It allows

me to browse the worldis consciousness

and find the genetically enhanced.

XAVIER (contid)

This is how I found you.

LOGAN

You designed this yourself?

XAVIER

Actually, Magneto helped me put it

together.

LOGAN

He helped you?

XAVIER

We were friends once...  But that was

a long time ago.

ROGUE (O.S.)

I donit belong...  I donit belong...

Iim sorry... so sorry... thereis

nowhere...

XAVIER

Iive found her, Westchester Mall.

LOGAN

Iill go.

CYCLOPS

No...  Iill go.

LOGAN

O.K. sport... you go.

STORM

Rogue.

STORM (contid)

You donit have to run.

ROGUE

Iim sorry.  Iim not like the rest of

you -- Iim tired of hurting people.

STORM

Itis okay.

ROGUE

Why did I have to be like this?  What

purpose does it serve?

SABRETOOTH

Scream for me.

XAVIER

Dear God.

CYCLOPS

GET OUT OF THE WAY.  GET OUT OF THE

WAY.

ROGUE

SOMEONE HELP ME.  SHEiS NOT BREATHING.

CYCLOPS

ROGUE?

ROGUE (O.S.)

HELP ME.  STORM ISNiT BREATHING.

CYCLOPS

YOU HAVE TO COME AND GET ME.  I CANiT

SEE.

ROGUE

Here, here, here... a little left.

Careful.

CYCLOPS

Oh God.

XAVIER

But why would they do this?

LOGAN

You should always work with a spotter.

JEAN

Heis busy right now.

LOGAN

I was thinking maybe you and me could

go into town.

JEAN

Were you now?

LOGAN

What do you say?

JEAN

Not interested.

JEAN

Let go.

LOGAN

Suit yourself.

LOGAN

Heis uptight.

JEAN

He takes his work seriously.

LOGAN

He takes himself seriously.

JEAN

What is it youire failing to get at?

Are you interested in me?

JEAN

Iim just interested.

JEAN

Logan, do you see this ring?

LOGAN

Iive seen a lot of rings.

JEAN

Yeah, Iill bet you have.

JEAN

Rogue, where have you been?

ROGUE

Logan.  The Professor wants you to

come with me right away.

LOGAN

(to Rogue)

Hey Rogue, tell Jean what you were

telling me last night.

ROGUE

The Professor--

LOGAN

You remember.  About women.

ROGUE

Logan--

LOGAN

Whatever you say about them being the

same...

LOGAN (contid)

No two women smell alike.

JEAN

Logan, what are you doing?

LOGAN

This ainit Rogue!

MAGNETO (O.S.)

Telekinesis.

MAGNETO (contid)

Fascinating.  What I wouldnit give for

that.  Alas, metal is all Iim good

for.  But it seems to serve me well

enough.

LOGAN

Jean!

MAGNETO

I do love a good check mate.

LOGAN

What do you want?

MAGNETO

Come with me and Iill let her live.

LOGAN

You think I care about her?  Iim the

only one whois sure to walk out of

here.

MAGNETO

Then why donit you kill her.

MAGNETO (contid)

Go on.  Kill her.  You can do it

quicker than I will.  Maybe Iill just

cripple her.

MAGNETO (contid)

So do her the favor.  Show her mercy.

MAGNETO (contid)

(to Mystique)

Call the others and tell them we have

what we came for.

XAVIER

Itis going to be alright.

STORM

When Rogue left the mansion, they must

have followed her.

XAVIER

Yes... they wanted me out of the way.

If I had been here... I...

XAVIER (contid)

This was not your fault.  I knew there

was a danger, I should have never left

the school.

XAVIER (contid)

I am going to find Logan.

CYCLOPS

Whatis wrong with him?

JEAN

His vital signs are weak and getting

weaker.

BEAST

Iim in the process of running more

tests.  But it seems that every minute

that goes by he gets weaker.

ROGUE

Can you help him?

BEAST

I donit know.

BEAST

Itis gone.  The neuro-filter, someone

removed it.

STORM

What does that mean?

BEAST

The neuro-filter acts like a surge

protector, regulating the infinite

flow of information from Cerebro to

the Professoris mind.  Itis what keeps

him from being crushed by the

consciousness of millions.

CYCLOPS

Can the Professor repair his own mind?

BEAST

Iim afraid without Cerebrois help, he

wonit have the strength to heal

himself -- And without the neuro-

filter... thereis no Cerebro.

JEAN

Heis already losing control of his

vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular.

Unless we manage to replace the filter

by tomorrow morning, Iim afraid.

CYCLOPS

We have to find Magneto.

JEAN

Are you all right?

CYCLOPS

No.  Iim...  I donit know if we can do

this without Charles.

JEAN

He put you in charge for a reason,

Scott.

SMALL GIRL

Dr. Grey?...

SMALL GIRL (contid)

Someone is here to see you.

KELLY

Dr. Grey.

JEAN

Senator?

CYCLOPS

How did you get in here?

KELLY

Your front door was damaged... there

was a hole...

KELLY (contid)

... I squeezed through.

KELLY (contid)

What in Godis name are you?

BEAST

Iim Beast.

KELLY

Of course you are.

KELLY

Iim sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I

was afraid if I went to a hospital,

they would...

JEAN

(interrupting)

Treat you like a mutant?  We are not

what you think.  Not all of us.

KELLY

Tell it to the ones that did this to

me.

JEAN

I donit see these spikes youire

talking about.  Iim going to give you

an antibiotic for the - Oh my God.

XAVIER

Hello, Rogue?

ROGUE

Hold on, Iill get the others.

XAVIER

Senator... Kelly?

KELLY

Yes...  Who are you?

XAVIER

I am Charles Xavier.  This is my

school.

XAVIER (contid)

Can you tell me what happened to you?

KELLY

(weak, delirious)

I was kidnapped...  They killed

GUYRICH... mutants...  There was a

light... a bright... light.

KELLY (V.O.)

Whatever you do to me... no matter

what -- youill make me right.  Every

word I have spoken will be confirmed.

MYSTIQUE (V.O.)

And people like you are the reason I

was afraid to go to school as a child.

JEAN (V.O.)

The mutant gene tells the body when it

needs to change.

KELLY (V.O.)

I can assure you, there is no such

creature in my genes.

JEAN (V.O.)

In every organism on Earth there exits

a mutator gene -- The X-factor.  The

beginnings of another stage of

evolution.

MAGNETO (V.O.)

God works too slowly.

KELLY (V.O.)

What have you bastards done to me?

CHILDiS VOICE (V.O.)

Mom, is that a mutant?

MAGNETO (V.O.)

Youire a leader Senator Kelly, you set

an example...

GUYRICH (V.O.)

... A Demonstration of some kind?

MAGNETO (V.O.)

Because if more of you... were like

more of us... like more of us...

GUYRICH (V.O.)

... the UN summit... the whole world

will be watching.

KELLY (V.O.)

What is it you intend to do to me?

KELLY (V.O.)

Oh...  Oh God... what have you done to

me?

KELLY (V.O.)

Dear God.... dear... God.

NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

... the largest single summit in the

history of the planet.

JEAN (V.O.)

... the mutator gene will activate.

MAGNETO (V.O.)

Welcome to the future... brother...

The brotherhood of mutants.

BEAST

It appears as though Magneto has built

a machine which somehow triggers the

mutator gene in normal human beings.

And he is using Adamantium as its

core.

CYCLOPS

Its core?

BEAST

Thomas Edison knew how to make the

light bulb.  He had the energy source.

He had the vacuum.  But he didnit have

the filament.  He tried metal after

metal but nothing would hold to power.

STORM

(nods -- now understanding)

... until he found tungsten.

BEAST

Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is

the only metal strong enough to hold

the energy this machine produces.  He

used the Adamantium in Loganis dog tag

to test it on the Senator.  And I

assume now he plans to use the rest of

Loganis skeleton for a larger

demonstration.

CYCLOPS

For what purpose?

BEAST

Yes -- Only thereis a problem.  The

mutator gene is not responding to the

radiation the way it would in mother

nature.  Itis forcing the bodyis cells

to replicate thousands of times faster

than theyire accustomed to.  The

Senatoris body is literally burning

itself out.  Scott -- this machine

kills people and I donit think Magneto

realizes it.

CYCLOPS

So where do you think heis planning

this larger demonstration?

XAVIER

There...

BEAST

I wish I could go.

STORM

We all do.

BEAST

Storm.  Try to look for the highest

vantage point.

From what I can figure, heill need to

gain as much altitude as possible to

blanket the island.  It is my feeling

that Magneto has to--

STORM

Beast.

STORM (contid)

Weill be fine.

CYCLOPS

You can still hear me... canit you.

CYCLOPS (contid)

I want to thank you for taking me in.

Taking us in...  You have taught me

everything in my life that is worth

knowing.

CYCLOPS (contid)

And I want you to know that Iill take

care of them.

CYCLOPS

Hey.  Iim sorry.  About Logan.  I was

jealous.

JEAN

(putting her arms around him)

Well, I think thatis perfectly

understandable.

CYCLOPS

Iill tell you one thing though.

JEAN

Whatis that?

CYCLOPS

He calls me sport one more time, and

Iill blow a watermelon-sized hole

through him.

CYCLOPS (contid)

Now letis go get him.

NEWSCASTER

With the ceremonies beginning shortly,

it looks as though the last of the

dignitaries have landed at Newark and

Teterboro airports and will be

arriving momentarily.  It would seem

the United Nations has had their wish

tonight.  There doesnit seem to be an

empty seat in the house.

CYCLOPS

Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All

right, thereill be less security north

of the George Washington Bridge.  Iim

taking her down.

JEAN

Into the Hudson?

CYCLOPS

(smiles)

Uh-huh.

CYCLOPS

V.T.O.L. off.

LOGAN

(very weak)

Where am I?

MAGNETO

Youire backstage at the encore of

creation.

MAGNETO (contid)

Three minutes to curtain.

LOGAN

What are you going to do?

MAGNETO

In the road to survival, there is

always sacrifice Logan.  We are the

future... not them.  We must protect

ourselves.  After tonight, when the

leaders of the world return home --

They will return as brothers, as

mutants... and our cause will be

theirs.  This is survival, I know you

understand that, Logan... or is it

Wolverine?

MAGNETO

Give me your tired, your poor...

MAGNETO (contid)

... Your huddled masses.

MAGNETO (contid)

Lights.

JEAN

(points to the monitor)

The lights on the Statue of Liberty

are off.

STORM

Beast said that he would have to take

a high vantage point.

CYCLOPS

Letis dock over there.

CYCLOPS (contid)

Storm, give us some cover.

OPERATION COMMANDER

Liberty One, Liberty One, this is

Horizon, do you copy.

AGENTiS VOICE

Go, Horizon.

OPERATION COMMANDER

(on radio)

Liberty, whatis the situation with the

lights, over?

MYSTIQUE/AGENTiS VOICE

Uhhh, Horizon, weive seem to have had

a shutdown at the generator, weire

five by five.  There now, checking it

out.  Everything is fine other-wise.

OPERATION COMMANDER

(on radio)

Roger Liberty one.  Horizon out.

MYSTIQUE

Darling...  Weire clear.

CYCLOPS

We should check out operations, see if

the Secret Service is still around.

STORM

LOOK OUT.

CYCLOPS

Iim going to assume that means that

the Secret Service is out of

commission.  Jean, can you raise me up

there?

JEAN

Itis too far.

CYCLOPS

(assessing the situation)

Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south

entrance.

(pointing to the main

entrance)

Jean and I will go in here.

CYCLOPS (contid)

(to Storm and Rogue)

Iill see you both soon.

MAGNETO

(into radio)

Be careful everyone...  I think we may

have company.

STORM

(whispering)

Rogue... run.

CYCLOPS

Over there.

CYCLOPS

Get down!

MAGNETO

Lights on.

OPERATION COMMANDER

Roger.  We see the lights.

TOAD

Donit you people die?

CYCLOPS

Jean.  Jean stop.  Stop moving.

CYCLOPS (contid)

Jean, trust me.  Donit move.

LOGAN

I didnit mean to scare you.

ROGUE

Thank God.  Logan... we have to help

Storm we have to.

LOGAN

Iill go back, but first let me find

you a safe place.

LOGAN (contid)

Here, take my hand.

LOGAN (contid)

Take it!

MAGNETO

(into radio)

Mystique...  Mystique, where are you?

MAGNETO (contid)

Find Logan.

CYCLOPS

(whispering)

Jean... can you?

JEAN

(whispering)

Iim sorry.  Iim not strong enough.

MAGNETO

(whispering)

If the temperature changes a single

degree...

(looking at Jean)

I only need one hostage.

MAGNETO (contid)

(raising his voice)

Now if you can hear me Logan...

MAGNETO (V.O.)

... and I know you can -- It is a five

minute run from the furthest distance

on this island.  If you are not back

in this time...  I will kill these

friends of Xavieris.  Including the

young lady from the gymnasium.  I

think they came here to irescue you.i

MAGNETO (contid)

I also have a small piece of Cerebro

that might be of interest to you, if

you hope to save Charles Xavier.

MAGNETO (V.O.)

Xavier is dying you know.  Five

minutes Logan.

MAGNETO

Here -- Xavieris life.

MAGNETO (contid)

If I get what I want, you can try and

save him... for old times sake.

MAGNETO (contid)

Now... shall we talk about the

weather.

JEAN

Magneto.  Iive seen the results of

your machine.  Iive seen Senator

Kelly.

MAGNETO

Ahhhh, so the good Senator survived

his fall?  And the swim to shore?  He

is stronger than I ever could have

imagined.

JEAN

The experiment was a failure.  Kelly

didnit make it.  Yes, you were

successful in activating his mutator

gene, but you failed to take into

account the rest of his body -- it

wasnit ready for the strain.

Kelly was dead within hours.  Your

machine kills.

MAGNETO

Quiet...

MAGNETO (contid)

I donit believe you.

JEAN

You donit understand.

CYCLOPS

(yelling)

Stop it!

MAGNETO

Why canit you see what I am trying to

do?  Why do you stand in my way?

MAGNETO (contid)

Check and mate.

STORM

Logan!

MAGNETO

Ahh, there you are.

JEAN

(to Mystique)

You have to stop him, the machine...

it kills people...

JEAN (contid)

... Please do something.

MYSTIQUE

Donit listen to her... itis a trap.

MAGNETO

What is?

MYSTIQUE

This is.

JEAN

ROGUE, DESTROY THE MACHINE!

OPERATION COMMANDER

Liberty one this is Horizon...  I

repeat... do you copy?  Liberty one

this is Horizon ... I repeat... do you

copy?

SABRETOOTH

(whispering)

Your girlfriend is next.

SABRETOOTH

I donit think so.

CYCLOPS

Jean!

SABRETOOTH

Sorry about this sweetheart, but I

made Logan a promise.

LOGAN (O.S.)

Hey, ya big pussy.

LOGAN (contid)

I ainit finished with you yet.

SABRETOOTH

You?

LOGAN

Not just me.

LOGAN (contid)

Jean?

ROGUE

Hey...  There you are.

(sudden apprehension)

Is it really you?

LOGAN

(not quite sure what sheis

talking about)

Yeah, itis really me.

CYCLOPS

Come on, letis get out of here.

LOGAN

(sliding to the ground)

Iim o.k.  Iim o.k.

CYCLOPS

Sure you are, sport.

AGENT/MYSTIQUE

Hey, could somebody untie me!

SECRET SERVICE MAN #3

(to other agents)

Hey!  Over here.

ANCHORMAN (O.S.)

Even after last weeks terrorist

vandalization of the Statue of Liberty

by an unidentified mutant

organization, the outcome of the vote

was 51 to 49 in opposition to the

Mutant Registration Act.

CYCLOPS

Quiet.  Quiet everybody.

ANCHORMAN

This narrow defeat was probably due in

large part to the surprising last-

minute reversal by Senator Scott

iFranki Kelly, who until today

provided the loudest voice in the cry

for Mutant Registration.  Earlier

today, Kelly had this to say:

KELLY

(struggling to get through)

If we can not go into the future

together, the divisions of fear and

prejudice will tear this country

apart.

KELLY

No more questions.  Please, no more

questions.

LOGAN

Donit you knock?

XAVIER

Theyire all asking how youire doing.

Are you feeling up to saying hello to

everyone?

LOGAN

(pulling the glove off)

Actually Iim feeling up to leaving.

XAVIER

(surprised)

Why?  You have a home here now, if you

want it.  Everyone will...

LOGAN

What?... miss me?  Charley, Iim gonna

walk out the front door and trust me,

it wonit be soon enough for everyone

here.

LOGAN (contid)

Can I, umm?

XAVIER

Of course.  Everything in this room is

for you.

LOGAN

Thanks, Iill pay you back.

XAVIER

Well if youire going to leave then you

at least owe them a goodbye.

XAVIER (O.S.)

Excuse me.

(louder)

Excuse me.

XAVIER (contid)

Everyone, Logan would like to say...

XAVIER (contid)

Well, Logan.

LOGAN

Whatis a guy gotta do to get a beer

around here?

MAGNETO

I wouldnit really have let you die,

you know.  I just needed...

XAVIER

(interrupting)

I know.

MAGNETO

Doesnit it ever wake you in the middle

of the night?  The feeling that some

day, some day very soon, they will

pass that foolish law - or one just

like it - and they will come for you

and your children?  Take you all away?

XAVIER

It does indeed, Max.

MAGNETO

And what do you do when you wake up to

that?

XAVIER

I feel a great swell of pity for the

poor soul who comes to that school

again looking for trouble.

MAGNETO

But you know that it is a war, old

friend.  And to win a war it takes the

will to fight it at all costs, by any

means necessary.  And for that reason,

I will always have the advantage.  No

matter how you trap me, how I am

contained -

MAGNETO (contid)

- I will always find an escape.

XAVIER

And I will always be there, old

friend.

XAVIER (contid)

Check.

MAGNETO

And mate.
