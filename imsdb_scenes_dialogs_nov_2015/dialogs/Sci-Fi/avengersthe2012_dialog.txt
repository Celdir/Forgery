THE AVENGERS

Written by

Joss Whedon

CUT TO:

THE OTHER (V.O.)

The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a

little world. A human world. They would

wield its power,...

CUT TO:

THE OTHER (V.O.)

But our ally knows its workings as they

never will. He is ready to lead. And

our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

THE OTHER (V.O.)

The world will be his. The universe

yours. And the humans, what can they do

but burn?

CUT TO:

NICK FURY

How bad is it?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from

the Tesseract four hours ago.

NICK FURY

NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test

phase.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in

the room. Spontaneous advancement.

AGENT MARIA HILL

It just turned itself on?

NICK FURY

What are the energy levels now?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it

down, we ordered the evac.

NICK FURY

How long to get everyone out?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Campus should be clear in the next half

hour.

NICK FURY

Do better.

AGENT MARIA HILL

Sir, evacuation may be futile.

NICK FURY

We should tell them to go back to

sleep?

AGENT MARIA HILL

If we can't control the Tesseract's

energy, there may not be a minimum safe

distance.

NICK FURY

I need you to make sure that PHASE 2

prototypes are shipped out.

AGENT MARIA HILL

Sir, is that really a priority right

now?

NICK FURY

Until such time as the world ends, we

will act as though it intends to spin

on. Clear out the tech below. Every

piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.

AGENT MARIA HILL

Yes, sir.

(to standing agents)

With me.

NICK FURY

Talk to me, doctor.

SELVIG

Director.

NICK FURY

Is there anything we know for certain?

SELVIG

Tesseract is misbehaving.

NICK FURY

Is that supposed to be funny?

SELVIG

No, it's not funny at all. The

Tesseract is not only active,

she's...misbehaving.

NICK FURY

How soon until you pull the plug?

SELVIG

She's an energy source. If we turn off

the power, she turns it back on. If she

reaches peak level...

NICK FURY

We've prepared for this, doctor.

Harnessing energy from space.

SELVIG

We don't have the harness. Our

calculations are far from complete. Now

she's throwing off interference,

radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels

of gamma radiation.

NICK FURY

That can be harmful. Where's Barton?

SELVIG

The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.

NICK FURY

Agent Barton, report.

NICK FURY

I gave you this detail so you could

keep a close eye on things.

CLINT BARTON

Well, I see better from a distance.

NICK FURY

Are you seeing anything that might set

this thing off?

NASA SCIENTIST

(TO SELVIG)

Doctor, it's spiking again.

CLINT BARTON

No one's come or gone. It's oven is

clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there

was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at

this end.

NICK FURY

At this end?

CLINT BARTON

Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the

other end of space, right? The doors

open from both sides.

NICK FURY

Sir, please put down the spear!

LOKI

You have heart.

LOKI

Please don't. I still need that.

NICK FURY

(TURNING)

This doesn't have to get any messier.

LOKI

Of course it does. I've come too far

for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,

and I am burdened with glorious

purpose.

SELVIG

Loki? Brother of Thor?

NICK FURY

We have no quarrel with your people.

LOKI

An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

NICK FURY

You planning to step on us?

LOKI

I come with glad tidings, of a world

made free.

NICK FURY

Free from what?

LOKI

Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.

Once you accept that, in your heart...

LOKI

You will know peace.

NICK FURY

Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think

you mean the other thing.

CLINT BARTON

Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This

place is about to blow. Drop a hundred

feet of rock on us. He means to bury

us.

NICK FURY

Like The Pharaohs of Odin.

SELVIG

He's right. The portal is collapsing in

on itself. You got maybe two minutes

before this goes critical.

LOKI

Well, then...

CLINT BARTON

(pointing to the Loki team)

Need these vehicles.

AGENT MARIA HILL

Who's that?

CLINT BARTON

He didn't tell me.

NICK FURY

(through the walkie talkie)

Hill, do you copy?!

NICK FURY

Barton is...

NICK FURY

He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!

AGENT PHIL COULSON

No! Leave it!

AGENT PHIL COULSON

You're clear, sir! You need to go!

AGENT PHIL COULSON

(WALKIE TALKIE)

Director? Director Fury, do you copy?

NICK FURY

The Tesseract is with the hostile

force. I have men down. Hill?

AGENT MARIA HILL

A lot of men still under, don't know

how many survivors.

NICK FURY

Sound the general call. I want every

living soul not working rescue looking

for that brief case.

AGENT MARIA HILL

(WALKIE TALKIE)

Roger that.

NICK FURY

Coulson, get back to base. This is a

LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at

war.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

(WALKIE TALKIE)

What do we do?

THE AVENGERS

LUCHKOV

This is not how I wanted the evening to

go.

NATASHA

I know how you wanted this evening to

go. Believe me, this is better.

LUCHKOV

I'd like to know why they sent you to

carry out a carrier, a stained glass

and other random items.

NATASHA

I thought General Soholob was in charge

of the export business.

LUCHKOV

Soholob? Your reputation is quite a

progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.

Nothing but a pretty face.

NATASHA

You really think I'm pretty?

LUCHKOV

We do not need the Lermontov to

transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...

(IN ENGLISH)

You may have to write it down.

WEASELLY THUG

Ya?

(looks at LUCHKOV)

It's for you.

LUCHKOV

Who the hell is...

AGENT PHIL COULSON

You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.

We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put

the woman on the phone or I will blow

up the block before you can make the

lobby.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

We need you to come in.

NATASHA

Are you kidding? I'm working!

AGENT PHIL COULSON

This takes precedence.

NATASHA

I'm in the middle of an interrogation

and this moron is giving me everything.

LUCHKOV

I don't give everything.

NATASHA

Look, you can't pull me out of this

right now.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Natasha. Barton's been compromised.

NATASHA

Let me put you on hold.

NATASHA

Where's Barton now?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

We don't know.

NATASHA

But he's alive.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

We think so. I'll brief you on

everything when you get back. But

first, we need you to talk to the big

guy.

NATASHA

Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me

about as far as he can throw me.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

No, I've got Stark. You get the big

guy.

NATASHA

Bozhe moi.

ATTENDING WOMAN

What are doing here?! Get out! You

shouldn't be here!

LITTLE GIRL

I have to see the doctor! It's my

father!

BANNER

Calm down. What's wrong?

LITTLE GIRL

My father...

BANNER

Is he like them?

LITTLE GIRL

Please.

BANNER

Should have got paid up front, Banner.

NATASHA

You know, for a man who's supposed to

be avoiding stress, you picked a hell

of a place to settle.

BANNER

Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

NATASHA

Then, what is it? Yoga?

BANNER

You brought me to the edge of the city,

smart. I uh... assume the whole place

is surrounded?

NATASHA

Just you and me.

BANNER

And your actress buddy, is she a spy

too? Do they start that young?

NATASHA

I did.

BANNER

Who are you?

NATASHA

Natasha Romanoff.

BANNER

Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?

Because that's not gonna work out for

everyone.

NATASHA

No. No. Of course not. I'm here on

behalf of SHIELD.

BANNER

SHIELD. How did they find me?

NATASHA

We never lost you, doctor. We've kept

our distance, even helped keep some

other interested parties off your

scent.

BANNER

Why?

NATASHA

Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I

need you to come in.

BANNER

What if I said no?

NATASHA

I'll persuade you.

BANNER

And what if the... other guy says no?

NATASHA

You've been more than a year without an

incident. I don't think you wanna break

that streak.

BANNER

I don't always get what I want.

NATASHA

Doctor, we're facing a potential global

catastrophe.

BANNER

Well, those I actively try to avoid.

NATASHA

This is the Tesseract. It has the

potential energy to wipe out the

planet.

BANNER

What does Fury want me to do? Swallow

it?

NATASHA

Well, he wants you to find it. It's

been taken. It emits a gamma signature

that's too weak for us to trace.

There's no one that knows gamma

radiation like you do. If there was,

that's where I'd be.

BANNER

So Fury isn't after the monster?

NATASHA

Not that he's told me.

BANNER

And he tells you everything?

NATASHA

Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

BANNER

He needs me in a cage?

NATASHA

No one's gonna put you in a...

BANNER

STOP LYING TO ME!

BANNER

I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted

to see what you'd do. Why don't we do

this the easy way, where you don't use

that, and the other guy doesn't make a

mess? Okay? Natasha...

NATASHA

Stand down. We're good here.

BANNER

Just you and me?

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

This is out of line, Director. You're

dealing with forces you can't control.

NICK FURY

You ever been in a war, Councilman? In

a firefight? Did you feel an

overabundance of control?

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

You saying that this Asgard has

declared war on our planet?

NICK FURY

Not Asgard. Loki.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2

He can't be working alone. What about

the other one? His brother.

NICK FURY

Our intelligence says, Thor is not a

hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't

depend on him to help. It's up to us.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

Which is why you should be focusing on

phase 2, it was designed for exactly...

NICK FURY

PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We

need a response team.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

NICK FURY

This isn't about The Avengers.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

We're running the world's greatest

covert security network and you're

gonna leave the fate of human race to a

handful of freaks.

NICK FURY

I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We

need a response team. These people

maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I

believe with the right push they can be

exactly what we need.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2

You believe?

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

NICK FURY

No, it's won by soldiers.

STEVE (V.O.)

There's not enough time! I gotta put

her in the water!

PEGGY (V.O.)

You won't be alone.

SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.)

Oh my god!

SHIELD SCIENTIST

This guy is still alive!

NICK FURY

Trouble sleeping?

STEVE

I slept for seventy years, sir. I think

I've had my fill.

NICK FURY

Then you should be out, celebrating,

seeing the world.

STEVE

I went under, the world was at war, I

wake up, they say we won. They didn't

say what we lost.

NICK FURY

We've made some mistakes along the way.

Some very recently.

STEVE

You here with a mission, sir?

NICK FURY

I am.

STEVE

Trying to get me back in the world?

NICK FURY

Trying to save it.

STEVE

Hydra's secret weapon.

NICK FURY

Howard Stark fished that out of the

ocean when he was looking for you. He

thought what we think, the Tesseract

could be the key to unlimited

sustainable energy. That's something

the world sorely needs.

STEVE

Who took it from you?

NICK FURY

He's called Loki. He's not from around

here. There's a lot we'll have to bring

you up to speed on if you're in. The

world has gotten even stranger than you

already know.

STEVE

At this point, I doubt anything would

surprise me.

NICK FURY

Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a

debriefing package waiting for you back

at your apartment.

NICK FURY

Is there anything you can tell us about

the Tesseract that we ought to know

now?

STEVE

You should have left it in the ocean.

TONY

You're good on this end. The rest is up

to you.

PEPPER POTTS

(on the other line)

You disconnected the transition lines?

Are we off the grid?

TONY

Stark Tower is about to become a beacon

of self-sustaining clean energy.

PEPPER

Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over

and it actually works?

TONY

I assume. Light her up.

PEPPER

How does it look?

TONY

Like Christmas, but with more... me.

PEPPER

Gotta go wider on the public awareness

campaign. You need to do some press. I

can do some more tomorrow. I'm working

on the zoning for the next billboards.

TONY

Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?

Enjoy the moment.

PEPPER

Then get in here and I will.

JARVIS

Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the

line.

TONY

I'm not in. I'm actually out.

JARVIS

Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

TONY

Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

PEPPER

Levels are holding steady... I think.

TONY

Of course they are, I was directly

involved. Which brings me to my next

question: how does it feel to be a

genius?

PEPPER

Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now,

would I?

TONY

What do you mean? All this came from

you.

PEPPER

No. All this came from that.

TONY

Give yourself some credit, please.

Stark Tower is your baby. Give

yourself... twelve percent of the

credit.

PEPPER

Twelve percent?

TONY

An argument can be made for fifteen.

PEPPER

Twelve percent? For my baby?

TONY

Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

And sorry, but the security snafu? That

was on you.

PEPPER

Oooooh.

TONY

My private elevator...

PEPPER

You mean OUR elevator?

TONY

...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm

going to pay for that comment about

percentages in some subtle way later,

aren't I?

PEPPER

Not gonna be that subtle.

TONY

I'll tell you what. Next building's

gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

PEPPER

On the lease.

TONY

...Call your mom, can you bunk over?

JARVIS

Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my

protocols are being overwritten.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up

his phone and looks into it at Coulson.

TONY

You have reached the life model decoy

of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

This is urgent.

TONY

Then leave it urgently.

TONY

Security breach.

(TO PEPPER)

That's on you.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Mr. Stark.

PEPPER

Phil! Come in.

TONY

Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.

PEPPER

Come on in, we're celebrating.

TONY

Which is why he can't stay.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

We need you to look this over.

(he holds out a file towards

STARK)

Soon as possible.

TONY

I don't like being handed things.

PEPPER

That's alright, `cause I love to be

handed things. So, let's trade.

PEPPER

Thank you.

TONY

Official consulting hours are between

eight and five every other Thursday.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

This isn't a consultation.

PEPPER

Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I

know nothing about.

TONY

The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I

thought. And I didn't even qualify.

PEPPER

I didn't know that either.

TONY

Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-

obsessed, don't play well with others.

PEPPER

That I did know.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

This isn't about personality profiles

anymore.

TONY

Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?

TONY

You know, I thought we were having a

moment.

PEPPER

I was having twelve percent of a

moment. This seems serious, Phil's

pretty shaken.

TONY

How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

PEPPER

What is all of this?

TONY

This is, uh...

TONY

This.

PEPPER

I'm going to take the jet to D.C.

tonight.

TONY

Tomorrow.

PEPPER

You've got homework. You've got a lot

of homework.

TONY

Well, what if I didn't?

PEPPER

If you didn't?

TONY

Yeah.

PEPPER

You mean if you finished?

(Stark nods his head)

Well, um...then...

TONY

Square deal. It's the last date.

PEPPER

Work hard.

PILOT

We're about forty minutes out from

base, sir.

STEVE

So, this Doctor Banner was trying to

replicate the serum that was used on

me?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

A lot of people were. You were the

world's first superhero. Banner thought

gamma radiation might hold the key to

unlocking Erskine's original formula.

STEVE

Didn't really go his way, did it?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Not so much. When he's not that thing

though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

He's like a smart person. I gotta say,

it's an honor to meet you, officially.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

I sort of met you, I mean, I watched

you while you were sleeping.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

I mean, I was... I was present while

you were unconscious from the ice. You

know, it's really, it's just a... just

a huge honor to have you on board.

STEVE

Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've

made some modifications to the uniform.

I had a little design input.

STEVE

The uniform? Aren't the stars and

stripes a little... old fashioned?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

With everything that's happening, the

things that are about to come to light,

people might just need a little old

fashioned.

THE OTHER

The Chitauri grow restless.

LOKI

Let them go at themselves. I will lead

them into glorious battle.

THE OTHER

Battle? Against the meager might of

Earth?

LOKI

Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is

as formidable as you claim.

THE OTHER

You question us? You question HIM? He,

who put the scepter in your hand, who

gave you ancient knowledge and new

purpose when you were cast out,

defeated?

LOKI

I was a king! The rightful king of

Asgard! Betrayed!

THE OTHER

Your ambition is little, born of

childish need. We look beyond the Earth

to greater worlds the Tesseract will

unveil.

LOKI

You don't have the Tesseract yet.

LOKI

I don't threaten, but until I open the

doors, until your force is mine to

command, you are but words.

THE OTHER

You will have your war, Asgardian. If

you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from

us, there will be no realm, no barren

moon, no crevice where he can't find

you. You think you know pain? He will

make you long for something as sweet as

pain.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers.

STEVE

Ma'am?

NATASHA

Hi.

(TO COULSON)

They need you on the bridge. Face time.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

See you there.

NATASHA

There was quite the buzz around here,

finding you in the ice. I thought

Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you

to sign his Captain America trading

cards yet?

STEVE

Trading cards?

NATASHA

They're vintage, he's very proud.

STEVE

Dr. Banner.

BANNER

Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be

coming.

STEVE

Word is you can find the cube.

BANNER

Is that the only word on me?

STEVE

Only word I care about.

BANNER

(takes in the sentiment)

Must be strange for you, all of this.

STEVE

Well, this is actually kind of

familiar.

NATASHA

Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in

a minute. It's gonna get a little hard

to breath.

STEVE

Is this is a submarine?

BANNER

Really? They wanted me in a submerged

pressurized metal container?

BANNER

OH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE.

AGENT MARIA HILL

We're at lock, sir.

NICK FURY

Good. Let's vanish.

NICK FURY

Gentlemen.

NICK FURY

Doctor, thank you for coming.

BANNER

Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how

long am I staying?

NICK FURY

Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,

you're in the clear.

BANNER

Where are you with that?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

We're sweeping every wirelessly

accessible camera on the planet.

Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected

to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for

us.

NATASHA

That's still not gonna find them in

time.

BANNER

You have to narrow the field. How many

spectrometers do you have access to?

NICK FURY

How many are there?

BANNER

Call every lab you know, tell them to

put the spectrometers on the roof and

calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll

rough out a tracking algorithm based on

cluster recognition. At least we could

rule out a few places. Do you have

somewhere for me to work?

NICK FURY

Agent Romanoff, would you show

Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.

NATASHA

You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all

the toys.

SELVIG

Put it over there!

(TO BARTON)

Where did you find all these people?

CLINT BARTON

SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,

Doctor.

CLINT BARTON

Is this the stuff you need?

SELVIG

Yeah, iridium. It's found in

meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's

very hard to get hold of.

CLINT BARTON

Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.

SELVIG

Well, I didn't know!

(sees Loki coming)

Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so

much. It's more than just knowledge,

it's... truth.

LOKI

I know. What did it show you, Agent

Barton?

CLINT BARTON

My next target.

LOKI

Tell me what you need.

CLINT BARTON

I'll need a distraction.

(grabs his bow)

And an eyeball.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

STEVE

No, no. It's fine.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

It's a vintage set. It took me a couple

of years to collect them all. Near

mint, slight foxing around the edges,

but...

AGENT JASPER SITWELL

We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent

match. Weight, cross match, seventy-

nine percent.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Location?

AGENT JASPER SITWELL

Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.

He's not exactly hiding.

NICK FURY

Captain, you're up.

LOKI

Kneel before me.

LOKI

I said. KNEEL!!!

LOKI

Is not this simpler? Is this not your

natural state? It's the unspoken truth

of humanity, that you crave

subjugation. The bright lure of freedom

diminishes your life's joy in a mad

scramble for power, for identity. You

were made to be ruled. In the end, you

will always kneel.

ELDER GERMAN MAN

Not to men like you.

LOKI

There are no men like me.

ELDER GERMAN MAN

There are always men like you.

LOKI

Look to your elder, people. Let him be

an example.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

You know, the last time I was in

Germany and saw a man standing above

everybody else, we ended up

disagreeing.

LOKI

(STANDING UP)

The soldier. A man out of time.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

I'm not the one who's out of time.

NATASHA

Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

LOKI

Kneel.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Not today!

NATASHA

The guy's all over the place.

IRON MAN

Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?

IRON MAN

Make your move, Reindeer Games.

IRON MAN

Good move.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Mr. Stark.

IRON MAN

Captain.

NICK FURY (V.O.)

Said anything?

NATASHA

Not a word.

NICK FURY (V.O.)

Just get him here. We're low on time.

STEVE

I don't like it.

TONY

What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

STEVE

I don't remember it being ever that

easy. This guy packs a wallop.

TONY

Still, you are pretty spry, for an

older fellow. What's your thing?

Pilates?

STEVE

What?

TONY

It's like calisthenics. You might have

missed a couple things, you know, doing

time as a Capsicle.

STEVE

Fury didn't tell me he was calling you

in.

TONY

Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury

doesn't tell you.

NATASHA

Where's this coming from?

STEVE

What's the matter? Scared of a little

lightning?

LOKI

I'm not overly fond of what follows.

IRON MAN

Now there's that guy.

NATASHA

Another Asgardian?

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Think the guy's a friendly?

IRON MAN

Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or

kills him, the Tesseract's lost.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Stark, we need a plan of attack!

IRON MAN

I have a plan. Attack.

NATASHA

I'd sit this one out, Cap.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

I don't see how I can.

NATASHA

These guys come from legends, they're

basically gods.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm

pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

THOR

Where is the Tesseract?

LOKI

(LAUGHS)

I missed you too.

THOR

Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!

LOKI

Oh, you should thank me. With the

Bifrost gone how much dark energy did

the Allfather have to muster to conjure

you here? Your precious Earth.

THOR

I thought you dead.

LOKI

Did you mourn?

THOR

We all did. Our father...

LOKI

Your father. He did tell you my true

parentage, did he not?

THOR

We were raised together, we played

together, we fought together. Do you

remember none of that?

LOKI

(TURNS AROUND)

I remember a shadow. Living in the

shade of your greatness. I remember you

tossing me into an abyss. I was and

should be king!

THOR

So you take the world I love as

recompense for your imagined slights.

No, the Earth is under my protection,

Loki.

LOKI

(LAUGHS)

And you're doing a marvelous job with

that. The humans slaughter each other

in droves, while you idly threat. I

mean to rule them. And why should I

not?

THOR

You think yourself above them.

LOKI

Well, yes.

THOR

Then you miss the truth of ruling,

brother. Throne would suit you ill.

LOKI

I've seen worlds you've never known

about! I have grown, Odinson, in my

exile! I have seen the true power of

the Tesseract, and when I wield it...

THOR

Who showed you this power? Who controls

the would-be-king?

LOKI

I am a king!

THOR

Not here! You give up the Tesseract!

You give up this poisonous dream! You

come home.

LOKI

I don't have it. You need the cube to

bring me home, but I've sent it off I

know not where.

THOR

You listen well, brother. I...

LOKI

I'm listening.

THOR

Do not touch me again!

TONY

Then don't take my stuff.

THOR

You have no idea what you're dealing

with.

TONY

Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother

know you weareth her drapes?

THOR

This is beyond you, metal man. Loki

will face Asgardian justice!

TONY

He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.

Until then, stay out of my way...

tourist.

TONY

Okay.

JARVIS

Power at 400% capacity.

TONY

How about that?

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Hey! That's enough!

(comes down; looks at Thor)

Now, I don't know what you plan on

doing here.

THOR

I've come here to put an end to Loki's

schemes!

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Then prove it! Put the hammer down.

IRON MAN

Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his

hammer!

THOR

(TO CAP)

You want me to put the hammer down?

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Are we done here?

NICK FURY

In case it's unclear. You try to

escape. You so much as scratch that

glass.

NICK FURY

Thirty thousand feet, straight down in

a steel trap. You get how that works?!

NICK FURY

Ant.

NICK FURY

Boot.

LOKI

(SMIRKING)

It's an impressive cage. Not built, I

think, for me.

NICK FURY

Built for something a lot stronger than

you.

LOKI

Oh, I've heard.

LOKI

The mindless beast, makes play he's

still a man. How desperate are you,

that you call upon such lost creatures

to defend you?

NICK FURY

How desperate am I? You threaten my

world with war. You steal a force you

can't hope to control.

(MORE)

NICK FURY (CONT'D)

You talk about peace and you kill

`cause it's fun. You have made me very

desperate. You might not be glad that

you did.

LOKI

Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To

have the Tesseract, to have power,

unlimited power. And for what? A warm

light for all mankind to share, and

then to be reminded what real power is.

NICK FURY

(SMILING)

Well, you let me know if Real Power

wants a magazine or something.

BANNER

He really grows on you, doesn't he?

STEVE

Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor,

what's his play?

THOR

(COMING TOO)

He has an army called the Chitauri.

They're not of Asgard or any world

known. He means to lead them against

your people. They will win him the

earth. In return, I suspect, for the

Tesseract.

STEVE

(SERIOUSLY)

An army? From outer space?

BANNER

THOR

BANNER

THOR

NATASHA

NATASHA

THOR

BANNER

TONY

(walks in with Coulson; to

COULSON)

TONY (CONT'D)

(TO THOR)

No hard feelings, Point Break. You've

got a mean swing.

(referring to the Iridium)

Also, it means the portal can open as

wide, and stay open as long, as Loki

wants.

(TO CREW)

Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top

sails. That man is playing GALAGA!

Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.

(covering his eye, looks

AROUND)

How does Fury do this?

AGENT MARIA HILL

He turns.

TONY

Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest

of the raw materials, Agent Barton can

get his hands on pretty easily. Only

major component he still needs is a

power source. A high energy density,

something to kick start the cube.

AGENT MARIA HILL

When did you become an expert in

thermonuclear astrophysics?

TONY

Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes,

the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the

only one who did the reading?

STEVE

Does Loki need any particular kind of

power source?

BANNER

He's got to heat the cube to a

hundredand twenty million Kelvin just

to break through the Coulomb barrier.

TONY

Unless, Selvig has figured out how to

stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.

BANNER

Well, if he could do that he could

achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor

on the planet.

TONY

Finally, someone who speaks English.

STEVE

Is that what just happened?

TONY

It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

You're work on anti-electron collisions

is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of

the way you lose control and turn into

an enormous green rage monster.

BANNER

(LOOKS DOWN)

Thanks.

NICK FURY

(WALKING IN)

Dr. Banner is only here to track the

cube. I was hoping you might join him.

STEVE

Let's start with that stick of his. It

may be magical, but it works an awful

lot like a HYDRA weapon.

NICK FURY

I don't know about that, but it is

powered by the cube. And I'd like to

know how Loki used it to turn two of

the sharpest men I know into his

personal flying monkeys.

THOR

Monkeys? I do not understand.

STEVE

I do! I understood that reference.

TONY

Shall we play, doctor?

BANNER

Let's play some.

BANNER

The gamma readings are definitely

consistent with Selvig's reports on the

Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to

process.

TONY

If we bypass their mainframe and direct

a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can

clock this around six hundred

teraflops.

BANNER

All I packed was a tooth brush.

TONY

(SMILES)

You know, you should come by STARK

TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all

R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.

BANNER

Thanks, but the last time I was in New

York I kind of broke...Harlem.

TONY

Well, I promise a stress free

environment. No tension. No surprises.

BANNER

OW!

TONY

Nothing?

STEVE

(TO BANNER)

Hey! Are you nuts?

TONY

You really have got a lid on it,

haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow

jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?

STEVE

Is everything a joke to you?

TONY

Funny things are.

STEVE

Threatening the safety of everyone on

this ship isn't funny. No offense,

doctor.

BANNER

No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come

aboard if I couldn't handle pointy

things.

TONY

You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to

strut.

STEVE

And you need to focus on the problem,

Mr. Stark.

TONY

You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us

and why now? Why not before? What isn't

he telling us? I can't do the equation

unless I have all the variables.

STEVE

You think Fury's hiding something?

TONY

He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His

secrets have secrets.

(points to Banner)

It's bugging him too, isn't it?

BANNER

(bobbling the words)

Uh...I just wanna finish my work here

and...

STEVE

Doctor?

BANNER

'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's

jab at Fury about the cube.

STEVE

I heard it.

BANNER

(pointing at Tony)

Well, I think that was meant for you.

Even if Barton didn't post that all

over the news.

STEVE

The Stark Tower? That big ugly

(Tony gives him a look)

...building in New York?

BANNER

TONY

BANNER

(referring to Tony)

TONY

STEVE

(taken by that)

TONY

(holds out a bag of blueberries)

STEVE

TONY

STEVE

I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

This is a man who means to start a war,

and if don't stay focused, he'll

succeed. We have orders, we should

follow them.

TONY

Following is not really my style.

STEVE

(SMILING)

And you're all about style, aren't you?

TONY

(a nerve hit)

Of the people in this room, which one

is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B.

not of use?

BANNER

Steve, tell me none of this smells a

little funky to you?

STEVE

Just find the cube.

TONY

That's the guy my dad never shut up

about? Wondering if they shouldn't have

kept him on ice.

BANNER

The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does

have the jump on us.

TONY

What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.

TONY (CONT'D)

It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm

gonna be there when it does.

BANNER

And I'll read all about it.

TONY

Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like

the rest of us.

BANNER

Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.

I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a

nightmare.

TONY

You know, I've got a cluster of

shrapnel, trying every second to crawl

its way into my heart.

(points at the MINI-ARC

REACTOR in his chest)

This stops it. This little circle of

light. It's part of me now, not just

armor. It's a... terrible privilege.

BANNER

But you can control it.

TONY

Because I learned how.

BANNER

It's different.

TONY

Hey, I've read all about your accident.

That much gamma exposure should have

killed you.

BANNER

So you're saying that the Hulk... the

other guy... saved my life?

(MORE)

BANNER (CONT'D)

That's nice. It's a nice sentiment.

Saved it for what?

TONY

(A BEAT)

I guess we'll find out.

BANNER

You might not like that.

TONY

You just might.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

As soon as Loki took the doctor we

moved Jane Foster. We've got an

excellent observatory in Traunsee. She

was asked to consult there very

suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee,

private plane, very remote. She'll be

safe.

THOR

Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking

Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for

him once he's done. Erik is a good man.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

He talks about you a lot. You changed

his life. You changed everything around

here.

THOR

They were better as they were. We

pretend on Asgard that we're more

advanced, but we...we come here

battling like BILCHSTEIM.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Like what?

THOR

BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big

antlers. You don't have those?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Don't think so.

THOR

They are repulsive, and they trample

everything in their path.

THOR

When I first came to earth, Loki's rage

followed me here and your people paid

the price. And now again. In my youth I

courted war.

NICK FURY (O.S.)

War hasn't started yet.

(WALKING IN)

You think you can make Loki tell us

what the Tesseract is?

THOR

I do not know. Loki's mind is far

afield, it's not just power he craves,

it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain

that would prize his need from him.

NICK FURY

A lot of guys think that, until the

pain stops.

THOR

What are you asking me to do?

NICK FURY

I'm asking. What are you prepared to

do?

THOR

Loki is a prisoner.

NICK FURY

Then why do I feel like he's the only

person on this boat that wants to be

here?

LOKI

There's not many people that can sneak

up on me.

(turns to see NATASHA

STANDING THERE)

NATASHA

But you figured I'd come.

LOKI

After. After whatever tortures Fury can

concoct, you would appear as a friend,

as a balm. And I would cooperate.

NATASHA

LOKI

NATASHA

LOKI

NATASHA

LOKI

(SITTING DOWN)

NATASHA

(she pulls up a chair as

WELL)

LOKI

NATASHA

LOKI

(LAUGHS)

NATASHA

Regimes fall every day. I tend not to

weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.

LOKI

What is it you want?

NATASHA

It's really not that complicated. I've

got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe

it out.

LOKI

Can you? Can you wipe out that much

red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SAO PAULO? THE

HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me

everything. Your ledger is dripping,

it's gushing red, and you think saving

a man no more virtuous than yourself

will change anything?

(STANDING; ANGRY)

This is the basest sentimentality. This

is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!

INTERCUTS

LOKI (V.O.)

You lie and kill in the service of

liars and killers.

LOKI (V.O.)

You pretend to be separate, to have

your own code, something that makes up

for the horrors. But they are a part of

you, and they will never go away!

LOKI

I won't touch Barton. Not until I make

him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In

every way he knows you fear! And when

he'll wake just long enough to see his

good work, and when he screams, I'll

split his skull! This is my bargain,

you mewling quim!

NATASHA

(QUIETLY; DISTRAUGHT)

You're a monster.

LOKI

(LAUGHS)

No, you brought the monster.

NATASHA

(turns back around; poised)

So, Banner... that's your play.

LOKI

(STAGGERED)

What?

NATASHA

(ON EARPIECE)

Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep

Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send

Thor as well.

(TO LOKI)

Thank you for your cooperation.

NICK FURY

(ANGRY)

What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

TONY

Uh...kind of been wondering the same

thing about you.

NICK FURY

You're supposed to be locating the

Tesseract.

BANNER

We are. The model's locked and we're

sweeping for the signature now. When we

get a hit, we'll have the location

within half a mile.

TONY

And you'll get your cube back, no muss,

no fuss.

(suddenly his monitor show a

collection of SECRET FILES)

What is PHASE 2?

STEVE

PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make

weapons.

(TO TONY)

Sorry, the computer was moving a little

slow.

NICK FURY

(trying to explain)

Rogers, we gathered everything related

to the Tesseract. This does not mean

that we're...

TONY

I'm sorry, Nick.

TONY

What were you lying?

STEVE

I was wrong, director. The world hasn't

changed a bit.

BANNER

Did you know about this?

NATASHA

You wanna think about removing yourself

from this environment, doctor?

BANNER

I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well

removed.

NATASHA

Loki's manipulating you.

BANNER

And you've been doing what exactly?

NATASHA

You didn't come here because I bat my

eyelashes at you.

BANNER

Yes, and I'm not leaving because

suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd

like to know why SHIELD is using the

Tesseract to build weapons of mass

destruction.

NICK FURY

Because of him.

(pointing at Thor)

THOR

(STUNNED)

Me?

NICK FURY

THOR

NICK FURY

STEVE

THOR

STEVE

NICK FURY

TONY

NICK FURY

STEVE TONY

I thought humans were more

evolved than this.

NICK FURY

Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet

and blow stuff up?

THOR

Did you always give your champions such

mistrust?

NATASHA BANNER

TONY STEVE

(to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one

SHIELD BASE VOICE

661 Bravo, please relay your pass code.

What is your hull, over?

BARTON

Arms to ammunition, over.

THOR

You speak of control, yet you court

chaos.

BANNER

It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what

are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a

chemical mixture that makes chaos.

We're... we're a time-bomb.

NICK FURY

You need to step away.

TONY

(puts his arm around Steve)

Why shouldn't the guy let off a little

steam?

STEVE

(pushes Tony off)

You know damn well why! Back off!

TONY

(comes face-to-face with Cap)

Oh, I'm starting to want you to make

me.

STEVE

Big man in a suit of armor. Take that

off, what are you?

TONY

Genius, billionaire, playboy,

philanthropist.

STEVE

I know guys with none of that worth ten

of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.

(MORE)

STEVE (CONT'D)

The only thing you really fight for is

yourself. You're not the guy to make

the sacrifice play, to lay down on a

wire and let the other guy crawl over

you.

TONY

I think I would just cut the wire.

STEVE

(SMILING)

Always a way out... You know, you may

not be a threat, but you better stop

pretending to be a hero.

TONY

(that did it)

A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat,

Rogers. Everything special about you

came out of a bottle!

STEVE

Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.

THOR

You people are so petty... and tiny.

BANNER

Yeah, this is a tee...

NICK FURY

Agent Romanoff, would you escort

Dr.Banner back to his...

BANNER

Where? You rented my room.

NICK FURY

The cell was just in case...

BANNER

In case you needed to kill me, but you

can't! I know! I tried!

(A BEAT)

I got low. I didn't see an end, so I

put a bullet in my mouth and the other

guy spit it out! So I moved on. I

focused on helping other people. I was

good, until you dragged me back into

this freak show and put everyone here

at risk!

BANNER

You wanna know my secret, Agent

Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay

calm?

STEVE

Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.

TONY

Got it.

BANNER

Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my

little party trick after all.

THOR

Located the Tesseract?

TONY

I can get there faster.

STEVE

Look, all of us...

THOR

The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no

human is a match for it.

STEVE

You're not going alone!

TONY

You gonna stop me?

STEVE

Put on the suit, let's find out.

TONY

I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

STEVE

Put on the suit.

BANNER

Oh, my God!

STEVE

Put on the suit!

TONY

Yep!

NICK FURY

Hill?!

AGENT MARIA HILL

Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is

down! Can we get a run in?

(runs over to GALAGA PLAYER)

Talk to me.

GALAGA PLAYER

(points to monitor)

Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but

it's impossible to get out there and

make repairs while we're in the air.

AGENT MARIA HILL

We lose one more engine, we won't be.

Somebody's got to get inside and patch

that engine.

NICK FURY

Stark! You copy that?!

TONY (V.O.)

I'm on it!

NICK FURY

Coulson! Initiate official lock down in

the detention section then get to the

armory! Move out!

NATASHA (CONT'D)

(quietly, to herself)

I'm okay. We're okay, right?

BARTON

Get that engine down! Detention! Get

him through the dark! Come with me.

TONY

Find engine three. I'll meet you there.

NATASHA

Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it.

This is just what Loki wants. We're

gonna be okay. Listen to me.

NATASHA

We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on

my life I will get you out of this, you

will walk away, and never...

BANNER

Your life?

NATASHA

(PLEADING)

Bruce.

NICK FURY

Bring the carrier inwards and head

south. Take us to the water.

HELMSMAN

Why water? Navigations recalibrated

after the engine failure.

NICK FURY

Is the sun coming up?!

HELMSMAN

Yes, sir.

NICK FURY

Then put it on the left! Get us over

water! One more turbine goes down and

we drop.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Stark, I'm here!

TONY

Good. See what we got.

TONY

I gotta get this super conducting

cooling system back online before I can

access the rotors and work on

dislodging the debris.

IRON MAN

I need you to get to that engine

control panel and tell me which relays

are in overload position.

IRON MAN

What's it look like in there?

CAPTAIN AMERICA

It seems to run on some form of

electricity.

IRON MAN

Well, you're not wrong.

THOR

We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to

think!

CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)

The relays are intact. What's our next

move?

TONY

Even if I clear the rotors, this thing

won't re-engage without a jump. I'm

gonna have to get in there and push.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Well if that thing gets up to speed,

you'll get shredded!

TONY

Then stay in the control unit and

reverse polarity long enough to

disengage mag...

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Speak English!

TONY

See that red lever? It'll slow the

rotors down long enough for me to get

out. Stand by it, wait for my word.

NICK FURY

We need a full evac on the lower hangar

bay.

AGENT MARIA HILL

GRENADE!

AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)

We got perimeter breach! Hostiles are

in SHIELD gear. Hold on to every

junction.

AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)

Sir, the HULK and Thor are in shuttle

levels 2, 3 and 4!

AGENT MARIA HILL

Sir, the Hulk will tear this place

apart!

NICK FURY

Get his attention.

AGENT MARIA HILL

(on her EARPIECE)

Escort 606, proceed to 270 MAIN

SHUTTLE! Don't get too close.

ESCORT 606 PILOT (V.O.)

Copy.

ESCORT 606 PILOT

Target acquired. Target engaged.

(pulls the trigger; fires

guns at HULK)

ESCORT 606 PILOT

TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY!

NICK FURY

They are not getting through here, so

what the hell...

AGENT JASPER SITWELL (O.S.)

Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1.

NICK FURY

It's Barton. He took out our systems.

He's headed for the detention level.

Does anybody copy?

NATASHA

This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.

NICK FURY (V.O.)

Stark, we're losing altitude.

IRON MAN

Yeah. Noticed.

THOR

NO!

LOKI

Are you ever not going to fall for

that?

LOKI

(smiles; walks over to the

CONTROL PANEL)

The humans think us immortal. Should we

test that?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Move away, please.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

You like this? We started working on

the prototype after you sent THE

DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it

does. Do you wanna find out?

THOR

Nooo!

BARTON

Natasha...

AGENT PHIL COULSON

You're gonna lose.

LOKI

(TURNING)

Am I?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

It's in your nature.

LOKI

Your heroes are scattered, your

floating fortress falls from the

sky...where is my disadvantage?

AGENT PHIL COULSON

You lack conviction.

LOKI

I don't think I...

AGENT PHIL COULSON

So that's what it does.

TONY

Cap, I need the lever!

STEVE (V.O.)

I need a minute here!

TONY

Lever. Now!

AGENT PHIL COULSON

Sorry, boss. They got rabbited.

NICK FURY

Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!

AGENT PHIL COULSON

No. I'm clocked out here.

NICK FURY

Not an option.

AGENT PHIL COULSON

It's okay, boss. This was never going

to work... if they didn't have

something... to...

NICK FURY (V.O.)

Agent Coulson is down.

SHIELD AGENT (V.O.)

Paramedics are on their way.

NICK FURY (V.O.)

They're here.

NICK FURY (V.O.)

They called it.

NICK FURY

These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

Guess he never did get you to sign

them.

NICK FURY

We're dead in the air up here. Our

communications, location of the cube,

Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.

Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that

coming.

(A BEAT)

Yes, we were going to build an arsenal

with the Tesseract. I never put all my

chips on that number though, because I

was playing something even riskier.

There was an idea, Stark knows this,

called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The

idea was to bring together a group of

remarkable people, see if they could

become something more. See if they

could work together when we needed them

to, to fight the battles that we never

could. Phil Coulson died still

believing in that idea, in heroes.

NICK FURY

Well, it's an old fashioned notion.

SECURITY GUARD

You fell out of the sky.

BANNER

(COMING TO)

Did I hurt anybody?

SECURITY GUARD

There's nobody around here to get hurt.

You did scare the hell out of some

pigeons though.

BANNER

Lucky.

SECURITY GUARD

Or just good aim. You were awake when

you fell.

BANNER

You saw?

SECURITY GUARD

The whole thing, right through the

ceiling. Big and green and buck ass

nude. Here...

SECURITY GUARD

I didn't think those would fit you

until you shrunk down to a regular size

fella.

BANNER

Thank you.

SECURITY GUARD

Are you an alien?

BANNER

What?

SECURITY GUARD

From outer space, an alien?

BANNER

No.

SECURITY GUARD

Well then, son, you've got a condition.

NATASHA

Clint, you're gonna be alright.

CLINT BARTON

You know that? Is that what you know? I

got...I gotta go in though. I gotta

flush him out.

NATASHA

We don't have that long, it's gonna

take time.

CLINT BARTON

I don't understand. Have you ever had

someone take your brain and play? Pull

you out and send something else in? Do

you know what it's like to be unmade?

NATASHA

CLINT BARTON

NATASHA

CLINT BARTON

(Natasha unfastens the

RESTRAINTS)

NATASHA

CLINT BARTON

NATASHA

CLINT BARTON

NATASHA

CLINT BARTON

NATASHA

CLINT BARTON

NATASHA

CLINT BARTON

But you don't. You're a spy, not a

soldier. Now you want to wade into a

war. Why? What did Loki do to you?

NATASHA

He didn't, I just...

(SHE PAUSES)

CLINT BARTON

Natasha.

NATASHA

I've been compromised. I got red in my

ledger. I'd like to wipe it out.

STEVE

Was he married?

TONY

No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.

STEVE

I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.

TONY

He was an idiot.

STEVE

Why? For believing?

TONY

For taking on Loki alone.

STEVE

He was doing his job.

TONY

He was out of his league. He should

have waited. He should have...

STEVE

TONY

(WALKS AWAY)

STEVE

TONY

(turns around sharply)

STEVE

TONY

(looking at the blood stained

WALL)

STEVE

TONY

STEVE

TONY

STEVE

Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.

TONY

Yeah. That's just a preview, this is

opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva.

He wants flowers, he wants parades, he

wants a monument built in the skies

with his name plastered...

(PAUSE)

Sonofabitch!

STEVE

Time to go.

NATASHA

Go where?

STEVE

I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly

one of those jets?

CLINT BARTON

I can.

STEVE

You got a suit?

CLINT BARTON

Yeah.

STEVE

Then suit up.

MONTAGE

YOUNG SHIELD PILOT

You are not authorized to be here...

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Son... just don't.

AGENT MARIA HILL

Sir.

NICK FURY

Agent Hill?

AGENT MARIA HILL

Those cards, they were in Coulson's

locker, not in his jacket.

NICK FURY

They needed the push.

(holding Coulson's cards)

NICK FURY

They found it. Get our communications

back up, whatever you have to do. I

want eyes on everything.

AGENT MARIA HILL

Yes, sir.

JARVIS

Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The

device is already self-sustained.

TONY

Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

SELVIG

It's too late! It can't stop now. He

wants to show us something! A new

universe.

IRON MAN

Okay.

JARVIS

The barrier is pure energy. It's

unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready

to be deployed.

TONY

Skip the spinning rims. We're on the

clock.

LOKI

Please tell me you're going to appeal

to my humanity.

TONY

Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten

you.

LOKI

You should have left your armor on for

that.

TONY

Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.

You've got the blue stick of destiny.

Would you like a drink?

LOKI

Stalling me won't change anything.

TONY

No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You

sure? I'm having one.

LOKI

The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will

change that. What have I to fear?

TONY

THE AVENGERS.

(Loki looks at him, confused)

It's what we call ourselves, sort of

like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES'

type of thing.

LOKI

Yes, I've met them.

TONY

(SMILING)

Yeah, takes us a while to get any

traction, I'll give you that one.

TONY (CONT'D)

But, let's do a head count here. Your

brother, the demi-God; a super soldier,

a living legend who kind of lives up to

the legend; a man with breath-taking

anger management issues; a couple of

master assassins, and you, big fella,

you've managed to piss off every single

one of them.

LOKI

That was the plan.

TONY

Not a great plan. When they come, and

they will, they'll come for you.

LOKI

I have an army.

TONY

We have a HULK.

LOKI

I thought the beast had wandered off.

TONY

You're missing the point. There's no

throne, there is no version of this,

where you come out on top. Maybe your

army comes and maybe it's too much for

us, but it's all on you. Because if we

can't protect the Earth, you can be

damned well sure we'll avenge it.

LOKI

(slowly walks up to him;

raising the scepter)

How will your friends have time for

me,when they're so busy fighting you?

LOKI

It should work.

TONY

Well, performance issues. You know?

TONY

Jarvis. Anytime now.

LOKI

You will all fall before me.

IRON MAN

And there's one other person you pissed

off! His name was Phil.

TONY

Right. Army.

THOR

Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll

destroy it!

LOKI

You can't. There is no stopping it.

There is only the war!

THOR

So be it.

BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)

Stark, we're heading north east.

IRON MAN

What, did you stop for drive-thru?

Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out

for you.

JARVIS

Sir, we have more incoming.

TONY

Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

HAWKEYE

Yeah.

BLACK WIDOW

See them.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Stark, are you seeing this?

TONY

I'm seeing, still working on believing.

Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)

Banner?

TONY

Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a

soft spot.

THOR

Look at this! Look around you! You

think this madness will end with your

rule?

LOKI

(tries to look away)

It's too late. It's too late to stopit.

THOR

No. We can. Together.

LOKI

Sentiment.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Those people need assistance down

there.

BLACK WIDOW

We got this. It's good. Go!

CAPTAIN AMERICA

(AT HAWKEYE)

You think you can hold them off?

HAWKEYE

Captain.

(pulls a trigger on his bow;

a narrow is mechanically

CHOSEN)

It would be my genuine pleasure.

BLACK WIDOW

Just like BUDAPEST all over again!

HAWKEYE

You and I remember Budapest

verydifferently.

YOUNG COP

We need to get out! They gotta bring

the National Guard!

POLICE SERGEANT

National Guard? Does the army know

what's happening here?

YOUNG COP

Do we?

CAPTAIN AMERICA

I need men in these buildings. There

are people inside that can run into the

line of fire. You take them through the

basement or through the subway. You

keep them off the streets. I need a

perimeter as far back as 39th.

POLICE SERGEANT

Why the hell should I take orders from

you?

POLICE SERGEANT

I need men in those buildings, lead the

people down and away from the streets.

I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

IRON MAN

(TO JARVIS)

We got his attention. What the hell is

step two?!

CAPTAIN AMERICA

What's the story upstairs?

THOR

The powers surrounding the cube is

impenetrable.

IRON MAN (V.O.)

Thor is right. We gotta deal with these

guys.

BLACK WIDOW

How do we do this?

CAPTAIN AMERICA

As a team.

THOR

I have unfinished business with Loki.

HAWKEYE

Yeah, get in line.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight

focused on us and that's what we need.

Without him these things could run

wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna

need us...

BANNER

So, this all seems horrible.

BLACK WIDOW

I've seen worse.

BANNER

Sorry.

BLACK WIDOW

No. We could use a little worse.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Stark? We got him.

IRON MAN (V.O.)

Banner?

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Just like you said.

TONY

Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing

the party to you.

BLACK WIDOW

I... I don't see how that's a party...

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good

time for you to get angry.

BANNER

That's my secret, Captain. I'm always

angry.

LOKI

Send the rest.

BLACK WIDOW

Guys.

IRON MAN

Call it, Cap.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Alright, listen up. Until we can close

that portal up there, we're gonna use

containment. Barton, I want you on that

roof, eyes on everything. Call out

patterns and strays. Stark, you got the

perimeter. Anything gets more than

three blocks out, you turn it back or

your turn it to ash.

HAWKEYE

Wanna give me a lift?

IRON MAN

Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck

that portal. Slow them down. You've got

the lightning. Light the bastards up.

(Thor flies up; to Natasha)

You and me, we stay here on the ground,

keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.

AGENT MARIA HILL

Sir. The council is on.

HAWKEYE

Stark. You got a lot of strings

sticking to your tail.

IRON MAN

Just try and keep them off the streets.

HAWKEYE

Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

Find a tight corner.

IRON MAN

I will roger that.

TONY

Nice call. What else you got?

HAWKEYE (V.O.)

Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down

on 6th.

TONY

And he didn't invite me?

BLACK WIDOW

Captain, none of this is gonna mean a

damn thing if we don't close that

portal.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

BLACK WIDOW

Well, maybe it's not about guns.

(gestures the flying

CHARIOTS)

CAPTAIN AMERICA

You wanna get up there, you're gonna

need a ride.

BLACK WIDOW

I got a ride. I could use a lift

though.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Are you sure about this?

BLACK WIDOW

Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

HAWKEYE

Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON,

they caught a lot of civilians there.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

I'm on it.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Everyone! Clear out!

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2

Director Fury, the council has made a

decision.

NICK FURY

I recognize the council has made a

decision, but given that it's a stupid

ass decision, I've elected to ignore

it.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

Director, you're closer than any of

oursubs, you scramble that jet...

NICK FURY

That is the island of Manhattan,

Councilman. Until I'm certain my team

can't hold it, I will not order a

nuclear strike against a civilian

population.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

If we don't hold them in the air, we

lose everything.

NICK FURY

I send that bird out, we already have.

BLACK WIDOW

Oh. You.

HAWKEYE

Nat, what are you doing?

BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)

Uh... a little help!

HAWKEYE

I've got him.

LOKI

ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH

ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND

I WILL NOT BE BULLIED...

HULK

PUNY GOD.

BLACK WIDOW

Doctor.

SELVIG

Loki's scepter, the energy...the

Tesseract can't fight. You can't

protect against yourself.

BLACK WIDOW

It's not your fault. You didn't know

what you were doing.

SELVIG

Well, actually I think I did. I built

in a safety to cut the power source.

BLACK WIDOW

Loki's scepter.

SELVIG

It might be able to close the portal.

(Selvig looks down. He sees a

GOLD GLEAM)

And I'm looking right at it.

JARVIS

Sir, we will lose power before you cut

through that shell.

IRON MAN

JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of

Jonah?

JARVIS

I wouldn't consider him a role model.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2

DIRECTOR FURY is no longer in command.

Override order, 7 ALPHA 11.

7 ALPHA 11 PILOT

7 ALPHA 11, confirmed. Prepare to

takeoff.

AGENT MARIA HILL

Sir, we have a bird in motion! Anyone

on the deck, we have a rogue bird! We

need to shut it down! Repeat! Take off

is not authorized!

NICK FURY

Stark, you hearing me? We have a

missile headed straight for the city.

IRON MAN (V.O.)

How long?

NICK FURY

Three minutes, at best. Stay low and

wipe out the missile.

IRON MAN

Jarvis, put everything we got into the

thrusters!

JARVIS

I just did.

7 ALPHA 11

Destination is in 2 minutes, 30 seconds

mark.

THOR

You ready for another bout?

CAPTAIN AMERICA

What? You gettin' sleepy?

BLACK WIDOW

I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I

can shut the portal down!

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Do it!

IRON MAN (V.O.)

No, wait!

CAPTAIN AMERICA

Stark, these things are still coming!

TONY

I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow

in less than a minute. And I know just

where to put it.

CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)

Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?

TONY

(TO JARVIS)

Save the rest for return, J.

JARVIS

Sir. Shall I call Miss Potts?

IRON MAN

You might as well.

BLACK WIDOW

Come on, Stark...

CAPTAIN AMERICA

(to BLACK WIDOW)

Close it.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

(SMILING)

Son of a gun!

THOR

He's not slowing down.

TONY

What the hell? What just happened?

Please tell me nobody kissed me?

CAPTAIN AMERICA

(A BEAT)

We won.

TONY

Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys.

Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's

just take a day. Have you ever tried

shawarma? There's a shawarma joint

about two blocks from here. I don't

know what it is, but I wanna try it.

THOR

(looking up at Stark Tower)

We're not finished yet.

TONY

And then shawarma after.

LOKI

If it's all the same to you. I'll have

that drink.

OLD MAN (STAN LEE)

Superheroes? In New York? Give me a

break!

SENATOR BOYNTON

These so called heroes have to be held

responsible for the destruction done to

the city. This was their fight. Where

are they now?

WAITRESS

What? That this was somehow their

fault? Captain America saved my life.

Wherever he is, wherever any of them

are, I just wanna say thank you.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #3

Where are the Avengers?

NICK FURY

I'm not currently tracking their

whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a

leave of absence.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2

And the Tesseract?

NICK FURY

The Tesseract is where it belongs: out

of our reach.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

That's not your call.

NICK FURY

I didn't make it. I just didn't argue

with the god that did.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

So you let him take it and the war

criminal, Loki, who should be answering

for his crimes?

NICK FURY

Oh, I think he will be.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

I don't think you understand what

you've started. Letting the Avengers

loose on this world. They're dangerous.

NICK FURY

They surely are. And the whole world

knows it. Every world knows it.

WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1

Was that the point of all this? A

statement?

NICK FURY

A promise.

AGENT MARIA HILL

Sir, how does it work now? They've gone

their separate ways, some pretty

extremely far. We get into a situation

like this again, what happens then?

NICK FURY

They'll come back.

AGENT MARIA HILL

You really sure about that?

NICK FURY

I am.

AGENT MARIA HILL

Why?

NICK FURY

Because we'll need them to.

THE END
