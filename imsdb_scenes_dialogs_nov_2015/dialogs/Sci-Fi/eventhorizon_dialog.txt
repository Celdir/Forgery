SHOOTING DRAFT

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

WEIR

(whisper)

I miss you.

WEIR (V.O.)

This is Weir.

LYLE (V.O.)

(tinny)

Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like

to see you as soon as possible.

CUT TO:

WEIR

You wanted to see me, Admiral?

HOLLIS

I apologize for the short notice,

Bill, but we've had something come

up that requires your immediate

attention. Lyle?

LYLE

At oh-three-hundred this morning,

TDRSS picked up an automated

navigation beacon broadcasting at

two minute intervals in Neptune orbit.

WEIR

Incredible... These are the same

coordinates before the ship

disappeared... this, this happened?

This isn't some kind of hoax?

HOLLIS

I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax.

Houston confirms the telemetry and

I.D. codes.

WEIR

(excited)

It's the Event Horizon. She's come

back.

HOLLIS

That ship was lost in deep space,

seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed

into New York harbor, I'd find it

more plausible.

(beat)

Houston wants Aerospace to send out

a search and rescue team, investigate

the source of the transmission. If

it really is the Event Horizon,

they'll attempt a salvage.

(beat)

We need you to prepare a detailed

briefing on the ship's systems for

the salvage crew...

WEIR

A written briefing can't possibly

anticipate the variables on a mission

like this. I have to go with them.

LYLE

Dr. Weir, you have no experience

with salvage procedures.

WEIR

I designed the ship's propulsion

system. I am the only person capable

of evaluating the performance of the

gravity drive. You can't send a Search

and Rescue team out there alone and

expect them to succeed. That would

be like... like sending an auto-

mechanic to work on the shuttle.

LYLE

I can understand your desire to redeem

your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it

doesn't factor into this.

WEIR

This is not about my reputation!

This is not about me at all!

(beat, passionate)

The Event Horizon was created for

one reason: to go faster than light.

Imagine mankind exploring new solar

systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven

years ago, we didn't just lose the

ship and the crew. We lost the dream.

(beat, quiet and

relentless)

I have to go.

HOLLIS

It's not that simple.

(off of Weir's

expression)

Lyle, play the recording for Dr.

Weir.

LYLE

Navigation Control tried to hail the

vessel. This was the only response.

LYLE

Since the initial transmission,

there's been no further contact.

Just the beacon, every two minutes.

WEIR

The crew? Could they still be alive?

LYLE

The ship had life support systems

for eighteen months. They're been

gone seven years.

WEIR

Someone sent that message. Admiral,

you have to put me on that ship.

HOLLIS

It's against my better judgement,

but I'll run this by the Man

downstairs. You'll know my decision

by the end of the day.

WEIR

Thank you.

HOLLIS

Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing

you any favors.

LYLE

You're not seriously considering

sending him?

HOLLIS

You don't just dismiss Bill Weir.

The man held Oppenheimer's chair at

Princeton. If the Event Horizon had

worked, he would have gone down in

history as the greatest mind in

physics since Einstein.

LYLE

The official inquiry blamed Weir's

design for the ship's loss.

HOLLIS

That doesn't mean a damn thing. They

were looking for a scapegoat and

Weir fit the bill. But he's not

responsible for what happened to the

ship.

LYLE

Does he know that?

HOLLIS

What's on your mind?

LYLE

He doesn't belong on this mission.

Responsible or not, he blames himself.

He's too close to it.

(beat)

And then there's his wife.

HOLLIS

It's been two years since she died.

He's over it.

LYLE

Some things you don't get over.

HOLLIS

I want our best people on this.

Where's Miller?

LYLE

The Lewis and Clark just returned

from patrol in the asteroid belt,

she's docked in bay four.

CUT TO:

SMITH

I can't believe this, I haven't gotten

more than my hand in six weeks and

now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap,

Mars has women...

STARCK

Smith's right. Neptune? There's

nothing out there. If something

happens, we'll be on our own.

MILLER

I don't like it either, but you know

the rules: we get the call, we go.

Is the course locked in?

SMITH

Locked and cocked.

STARCK

We're past the outer marker, we can

engage the ion drive whenever you're

ready.

MILLER

Justin?

JUSTIN

Everything green on my boards,

Skipper.

MILLER

Start the countdown.

STARCK

Ion drive will engage in... T-minus

ten minutes.

MILLER

Let's go.

MILLER

(not breaking stride)

Kill it.

COOPER

Time to play Spam in the can.

MILLER

Don't start with me, Cooper.

WEIR

Captain Miller, I just want to say...

MILLER

The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If

you'll follow the rest of the crew,

they'll show you to the gravity tanks.

MILLER

What's the hold up?

PETERS

Just loading the last of the CO2

scrubbers.

(to Miller, accusatory)

Good for four months.

MILLER

I put in for a replacement for you

but no one...

PETERS

No, no, its alright. I talked to my

ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas

and I'll get him this summer.

(beat)

Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen

him in two months.

MILLER

I am sorry. But now we have to go to

work.

CUT TO:

COOPER

Is that an offer?

STARCK

It is not.

WEIR

Captain Miller, I appreciate this

opportunity...

MILLER

Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on

your mission because we want to. We

were pulled off a well deserved leave,

to be sent out to the middle of

nowhere, and no one's even told us

why.

WEIR

I've been authorized to brief you

and the crew once we reach Neptune

space.

MILLER

Until then, do what you're told and

stay out of my way.

PETERS

First time in a grav couch?

WEIR

Yes.

PETERS

(Off of Weir's glance)

Don't worry about it. He's hard, but

he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping

out with him. He's one of the few

Captains in the service with

experience in the Outer Reach.

WEIR

He's been past Mars?

PETERS

He served on the Goliath.

WEIR

Wasn't that ship destroyed?

PETERS

(nods)

They attempted to rescue a supply

shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's

oh-two tanks ruptured during the

rescue, flooded both ships with pure

oxygen. There was a spark and both

ships were incinerated. The Skipper

and three others just made it to a

lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...

DJ

(interrupting)

He doesn't like to talk about it.

DJ

You didn't eat anything in the past

twelve hours?

DJ

When the Ion drive fires, we'll be

taking about 30 gees. Without a tank,

the force would liquefy your skeleton.

WEIR

I've seen the effect on mice.

MILLER

Five minutes.

DJ

Put this on.

PETERS

You'll be fine. You'll wake up and

we'll be there. Watch your fingers.

DJ

(checking the monitor)

Heart-rate decreasing... body temp

dropping to 80... 70... 60... 50...

40 degrees Fahrenheit. He's in stasis.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

VOICE

Billy...

VOICE

I'm so cold...

VOICE

I'm so cold...

WEIR

(tentative)

Claire?

WEIR

Claire? I'm sorry. Claire?

CLAIRE

I'm so cold...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WEIR

(gasping)

Claire...

PETERS

DJ!

(to Weir)

It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.

WEIR

I'm alright now. I'm alright...

DJ

Move slowly. You've been in stasis

for fifty-six days. You're going to

experience a little disorientation.

COOPER

Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like

that. Coffee?

WEIR

What?

COOPER

Coffee.

WEIR

No, thank you.

COOPER

Hey, Starck. You wanna dry my back?

STARCK

Maybe when you finish puberty.

MILLER

Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?

STARCK

I just finished drying...

MILLER

Then what are you doing here? Come

on, people, let's go!

(to Cooper)

And Cooper... Put some pants on.

CUT TO:

DENNY

(video)

Play horsey, Mommy, play horsey...

PETERS

(video)

Want to play horsey, do you...

(etc.)

SMITH

30 hours to Neptune orbit.

STARCK

All boards are green, everything's

five by five.

MILLER

That's good to know. Justin, you

wanna stow that?

MILLER

Okay, listen up. As you all know by

now, we have an addition to our crew.

Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation;

Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --

COOPER

You can call him Baby-bear, he loves

that...

MILLER

This is Cooper, what the hell do you

do on this ship, anyway?

JUSTIN

Ballast.

COOPER

(to Weir)

I am your best friend. I am a

lifesaver and a heartbreaker...

MILLER

He's a rescue technician. Peters,

medical technician. DJ...

DJ

Trauma.

MILLER

And this is mission specialist Dr.

William Weir. We all know where we're

going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us

why.

WEIR

What I am about to tell you is

considered code-black by the NSA.

JUSTIN

That means top-secret, Cooper.

COOPER

I heard it.

WEIR

The USAC intercepted a radio

transmission from a decaying orbit

around Neptune. The source has been

identified as the Event Horizon.

STARCK

That's impossible! She was lost with

all hands, what, seven...

JUSTIN

Seven years ago, the reactor blew...

PETERS

How can we salvage...?

SMITH

Let the dead rest, man...

COOPER

...cancel our leave and send us out

on some bullshit mission...!

MILLER

EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.

WEIR

What was made public about the Event

Horizon, that she was a deep space

research vessel, that its reactor

went critical, that the ship blew

up... None of that is true.

(beat)

The Event Horizon was the culmination

of a secret government project to

create a spacecraft capable of faster-

than-light flight.

SMITH

You can't do that.

STARCK

The law of relativity prohibits faster-

than-light travel...

WEIR

Relativity, yes. We can't break the

law of relativity, but we can go

around it. The ship doesn't really

move faster than the speed of light;

it creates a dimensional gateway

that allows the ship to

instantaneously "jump" from one point

in the universe to another, light

years away.

STARCK

How?

WEIR

Well, in layman's terms, you use a

rotating magnetic field to focus a

narrow beam of gravitons; these in

turn fold space-time consistent with

Weyl tensor dynamics until the space-

time curvature becomes infinitely

large and you have a singularity...

COOPER

Laymen's terms.

SMITH

Hey...

WEIR

Say this paper represents space-time,

and you want to get from "point A"

here...

(marks it on the photo

with a pen)

...to "point B," here.

(marks point B)

Now: what's the shortest distance

between two points?

STARCK

A straight line.

WEIR

Wrong. The shortest distance between

two points...

WEIR

...is zero. That's what the

singularity does: it folds space, so

that point A and point B coexist in

the same space and time. After the

ship passes through this gateway,

space returns to normal.

(hands the ruined pin-

up back to Smith)

It's called a gravity drive.

JUSTIN

How do you know all this?

WEIR

I built it.

COOPER

I can see why they sent you along.

JUSTIN

So if the ship didn't blow up, what

happened?

WEIR

It was the ship's maiden voyage, to

test the drive. The Event Horizon

moved to safe distance using ion

thrusters. They received the go-ahead

to activate the gravity drive.

(beat)

And the ship vanished from all our

scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced

optical, no radio contact of any

kind. They disappeared without a

trace.

(beat)

Until now.

MILLER

Where has it been for the last seven

years?

WEIR

That's what we're here to find out.

CUT TO:

WEIR

We haven't been able to confirm any

live contact, but TDRSS did receive

a single transmission from the Event

Horizon.

SMITH

What the hell is that?

PETERS

It doesn't sound like anything human.

WEIR

Houston has passed the recording

through several filters and isolated

what appears to be a human voice.

SMITH

Jesus...

MILLER

What is that?

DJ

It sounds like Latin.

COOPER

Latin? Who the fuck speaks Latin?

STARCK

No one. It's a dead language.

DJ

Mostly dead.

MILLER

What does it say?

WEIR

NSA encryption specialists have

deciphered some of the message...

WEIR

There: "...liberatis me..." They

haven't been able to translate the

rest, it's too distorted.

DJ

"Liberatis me." "Save me."

COOPER

From what?

MILLER

(to Weir)

You're convinced the crew could still

be alive? After seven years?

WEIR

The Event Horizon only had life

support for eighteen months. It seems

impossible, but in light of the

transmission... I have to think that

someone has managed to endure until

now.

COOPER

Skipper, do we get hazard pay for

this?

MILLER

You heard the tape, Smith. We're

looking for survivors.

CUT TO:

STARCK

Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach

angle is fourteen degrees.

MILLER

Come around to three-three-four...

SMITH

(echoing)

Heading three-three-four...

MILLER

(continuing)

...Make your approach vector negative

fourteen degrees...

SMITH

One-four degrees...

SMITH

We have a lock on the Event Horizon's

navigation beacon. It's in the upper

ionosphere, we're in for some chop.

MILLER

Bring us in tight. Starck, get on

the horn, see if anyone's listening...

STARCK

(into radio)

This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel

Lewis and Clark, hailing Event

Horizon, Event Horizon, do you

read...? This is the Lewis and Clark,

hailing...

(she continues B.G.)

SMITH

(over Starck)

Matching speed... now. Range to target

ten thousand meters and closing...

Skipper, I got a bad feeling about

this...

MILLER

We're all on edge, Smith. We're a

long way out...

SMITH

That's not it. That ship was built

to go faster than light... That's

just wrong, it goes against everything

we know...

MILLER

What are you trying to say? "If God

had intended Man to fly, he would

have given us wings?"

SMITH

Something like that, yeah.

MILLER

I guess we're about to find out.

Keep us slow and steady.

SMITH

Yes, sir.

MILLER

Dr. Weir...!

MILLER

I think you want to see this.

WEIR

Where is she?

SMITH

Dead ahead, 5000 meters.

SMITH

We've got some weather.

MILLER

I noticed. Starck, anybody home?

STARCK

If they are, they're screening their

calls.

SMITH

Range 3000 meters and closing.

WEIR

I can't see anything...

SMITH

1500 meters. We're getting too

close...

MILLER

Where is it?

STARCK

(checking her console)

The scope is lit, it's right in front

of us...

SMITH

1000 meters...

SMITH

Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters,

700... we're right on top of it,

we're gonna hit!

MILLER

Starck...

STARCK

It should be right there...

STARCK

My God.

MILLER

Reverse thrusters full!

SMITH

Jesus, that is one big ugly fat

fucker...

WEIR

She's not ugly.

SMITH

Range 500 meters and holding.

Turbulence is dropping off...

STARCK

Picking up magnetic interference.

MILLER

Put it through TACS. Smith, you up

for a flyby?

SMITH

(he is not)

Love to.

STARCK

Look at the size of that thing.

WEIR

Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge,

medical and science labs, hydroponics,

what have you. That central section

connects the forward decks to the

Engineering containment area. Can we

move in closer?

SMITH

Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna

need a rubber...

MILLER

Do it.

WEIR

That's the engineering containment.

And there's the main airlock. We can

dock there.

MILLER

Smith, use the arm and lock us onto

that antennae cluster.

WEIR

Be careful. It's not a load bearing

structure...

SMITH

(to Weir)

It is now.

(to Miller)

We're locked in.

MILLER

Starck, give me a read.

STARCK

The reactor's still hot. We've got

several small radiation sources,

leaks probably. Nothing serious.

WEIR

Do they have pressure?

STARCK

Affirmative. The hull's intact...

but there's no gravity and the thermal

units are off line. I'm showing deep

cold. The crew couldn't survive unless

they were in stasis.

MILLER

Find 'em, Starck.

STARCK

Something's wrong with the bio-scan.

MILLER

Radiation interference?

STARCK

There's not enough radiation to throw

off the scan. I'm picking up trace

life forms, but I can't get a lock

on the location.

WEIR

Could it be the crew? If they were

in suspended animation, wouldn't

that effect the scan?

STARCK

If they were in stasis, I'd get a

location, but these readings, they're

all over the ship. It doesn't make

any sense.

MILLER

Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by

deck, room by room. Starck, deploy

the umbilicus. I believe you're up

for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your

bonnet on.

JUSTIN

Yes, sir!

MILLER

Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.

WEIR

Captain, I didn't come out here to

sit on your bridge, I need to be on

that ship...

MILLER

Once the ship is secured, we'll bring

you on board --

WEIR

(interrupting)

That is not acceptable --

MILLER

(overlapping)

-- once we've secured the ship, that's

the way it is!

(beat)

I need you to guide us from the comm

station. This is where I need you.

Help us to do our job.

WEIR

Very well.

CUT TO:

COOPER

...come on, Skipper, I already put

my shoes on...

MILLER

(muffled)

You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's

Justin's turn. Stay on station. If

anything happens...

COOPER

I'll be all over it.

PETERS

(muffled)

Opening inner airlock door.

COOPER

You still need the rope? I thought

you were one a those spacemen with

ice in ya veins.

JUSTIN

I'd rather be on the rope and not

need it than need it and not have

it. Now step aside, old man.

COOPER

(serious now)

You just keep your nose clean, Baby

Bear. Clear the door.

WEIR

You've reached the outer airlock

door.

PETERS

We've got pressure.

MILLER

Clear and open on my mark. Three...

two... one... mark.

CUT TO:

PETERS

Jesus its huge.

MILLER

Ice crystals everywhere. This place

is a deep freeze.

WEIR (O.S.)

(radio)

You're in the central corridor. It

connects the personnel areas to

Engineering.

MILLER

Peters and I will search the forward

decks. Justin, take Engineering. No

hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?

JUSTIN

Not a chance, sir.

MILLER

Dr. Weir, what's this?

PETERS

(ahead at the next

coupling)

Here's another one. They're all over

the place.

WEIR (O.S.)

(radio)

They're explosive charges.

MILLER

I can see that, what're they for?

WEIR

In an emergency, the charges detonate

in series, destroying the central

section and separating the personnel

areas from the rest of the ship.

That way, if the gravity drive

malfunctions, the crew could use the

foredecks as a lifeboat.

PETERS

That means they didn't abandon ship.

MILLER

So where are they? Starck, any luck

with the bio-scan?

STARCK

I'm running diagnostics now,

Skipper... Nothing's wrong with the

sensor pack, I'm still getting trace

life readings, all over the ship.

PETERS

There's no one in the corridor but

us.

STARCK (O.S.)

(radio)

Not according to the computer.

MILLER

Peters is right, no one's here.

PETERS

I don't know, this place is really

dark, I can't see a thing...

MILLER

(calming her down)

Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay.

Let's finish the sweep.

WEIR (O.S.)

(radio)

Captain Miller, the foredecks are

just ahead.

PETERS

I can see the hatch.

MILLER

Starck, you still showing those

readings?

STARCK (O.S.)

(radio)

That's an affirmative.

MILLER

(to Peters)

Keep your eyes open.

PETERS

We found the gravity couches.

WEIR

Any survivors?

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

Negative.

WEIR

No one?

MILLER

They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving

forward.

WEIR (O.S.)

(radio)

You've reached the First Containment

Seal. The engineering decks are on

the other side.

JUSTIN

We still have pressure. The radiation

count's steady at 7 millirads an

hour.

WEIR (O.S.)

(radio)

Background radiation. Perfectly safe.

PETERS

Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?

WEIR (O.S.)

(radio)

You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters.

You still haven't seen any crew?

MILLER

If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd

know about it.

(looking around)

I'm in Medical. No casualties, it

looks like this place has never been

used.

PETERS

I found something.

WEIR

Yes, we can see some kind of mist.

What is that?

PETERS (O.S.)

(radio)

Blood. Looks like arterial spray.

WEIR

(nervous)

Can you see a body?

PETERS

(confused)

There's no one here.

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

The blood came from somewhere,

Peters...

PETERS

There's no one here, Skipper.

PETERS

Come on...

PETERS

Okay. I'm on the bridge.

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

What you got, Peters?

PETERS

Everything's been shut down.

Conserving power, I guess. Green

light on the hull, it's intact.

MILLER

The science workstation has power,

I'll see if I can find the crew from

here.

WEIR

Ms. Peters, turn back and to your

left, please.

STARCK

What is it?

WEIR

Ship's log.

PETERS (O.S.)

(radio)

I see it.

PETERS

It's stuck.

JUSTIN

I've reached another containment

door. This thing's huge...

WEIR (O.S.)

(radio)

That's the Second Containment Seal.

Beyond that, engineering.

JUSTIN

I'm going in.

PETERS

It's really jammed in there.

PETERS

(professional)

I found one.

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

Alive?

PETERS

Frozen.

STARCK

What happened to his eyes?

SMITH

Explosive decompression.

STARCK

Decompression wouldn't do that.

STARCK

You okay?

COOPER

Hey, Baby Bear, Mama Bear got a

corpsicle for ya...

COOPER (O.S.)

(radio)

Baby Bear, you copy?

COOPER

Justin, do you copy?

COOPER (O.S.)

(radio)

...do you copy?

JUSTIN

(quiet)

Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.

COOPER (O.S.)

(radio)

Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck

are you?

JUSTIN

I'm in the Second Containment area.

It's pitch black in here. There must

have been a coolant leak. Man, this

shit is everywhere. I can't see a

damn thing.

JUSTIN

The reactor's still hot. Coolant

level is on reserve, but still in

the green.

JUSTIN

(triumph)

I got it...

JUSTIN

(trailing off in awe)

Holy shit...

COOPER

Justin?

JUSTIN

I think I found something...

SMITH

What the hell is that?

WEIR

That's the Core: the gravity drive.

The heart of the ship.

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

Justin, check the containment for

radiation leaks. Peters...

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

...how's the client?

PETERS

Crystallized.

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

Justin, finish your sweep.

JUSTIN

Almost done, I just gotta check one

thing...

STARCK

Justin, hold on a sec, you're breaking

up...

STARCK (O.S.)

(radio)

Justin...?

(static obscure her

voice)

STARCK

Justin, come in...

WEIR

What is it?

STARCK

I don't know. The life readings just

went off the scale.

SMITH

Something's wrong...

MILLER

What the hell...

MILLER

Oh shit...!

STARCK

Miller, do you read me, Peters --

SMITH

Get them back --

STARCK

I'm trying, goddammit --

COOPER

What's happening?

STARCK (O.S.)

(intercom)

I don't know, the screens are dead...!

COOPER

350 meters... 400 meters...

DJ

He's in trouble. Go!

COOPER

I'm gone!

MILLER

Boarding party, sound off... Peters,

do you read me... . Peters...

PETERS

Denny...

MILLER

(growing desperation)

...Peters, do you read me...

VOICE

(radio)

Don't leave me...

MILLER

Justin? Justin, sound off...

Justin...!

COOPER

Hold on, Baby Bear...

COOPER

Oh my God...

COOPER

Justin, do you read me? Justin... .

COOPER

Baby Bear, don't do this. Don't do

this...

STARCK

Here comes another one! Hold on!

STARCK

We lost the starboard baffle! The

hull's been breached!

SMITH

The safety circuit's failed!

WEIR

We're losing atmosphere...

STARCK

There are pressure suits in the

Airlock. Go!

MILLER

Can anybody hear me...

PETERS (O.S.)

(radio)

Skipper...

MILLER

Peters...

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

...you okay?

PETERS

Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.

COOPER (O.S.)

(radio)

We have a man down...

MILLER

Coop, where are you...

COOPER (O.S.)

(radio)

The containment, Second Containment...

MILLER

Hold on, Coop...

SMITH (O.S.)

(radio)

Captain Miller...

MILLER

Smith, where the hell have you been?!

SMITH

We have a situation here...

SMITH

(continuing)

We lost the starboard baffle and the

hull cracked. Our safety seals didn't

close, the circuit's fried --

MILLER

Do we have enough time for a weld?

SMITH (O.S.)

(radio)

We don't have time to fart.

SMITH

We're losing pressure at 280 liters

a second and our oxygen tanks are

cracked. In three minutes, our

atmosphere will be gone. We are

fucking dead.

MILLER

No one's dying on my watch, Smith!

What about the reserve tanks?

SMITH (O.S.)

(radio)

They're gone.

WEIR

The Event Horizon.

SMITH

What?

WEIR

It still has air and reserve power,

we can activate gravity and life

support.

STARCK

What if the air has gone bad? We

can't wear these suits forever.

SMITH

I don't think this is a good idea,

we don't even know what happened on

that ship...

WEIR

It beats dying, Mister Smith.

MILLER

Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the

Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the

airlock.

SMITH (O.S.)

(radio)

But...

MILLER

You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you

with me?

PETERS

I'm ahead of you. Bringing the thermal

units on line...

PETERS

Hold tight and prep for gees.

CUT TO:

MILLER

Everybody okay?

STARCK

We're all here.

MILLER

Okay. Let's find out how much time

we just bought.

DJ

We haven't tested the air yet. It

could be contaminated...

MILLER

No time. We need whatever's left in

our suits to repair the Clark. Like

it or not, this is the only oxygen

for three billion kilometers.

STARCK

It tastes bad.

MILLER

But you can breathe it.

CUT TO:

STARCK

The antennae array's completely fried,

we've got no radio, no laser, no

highgain... No one's going to be

coming to help us.

MILLER

How much oh-two do we have?

STARCK

Oxygen is not the problem.

MILLER

Carbon dioxide?

STARCK

(nods)

It's building up with every breath

we take. And the CO2 filters on the

Event Horizon are shot.

MILLER

We can take the filters from the

Clark...

STARCK

I thought of that, with the filters

from the Clark, we've got enough

breathable air for twenty hours.

After that, we'd better be on our

way home.

MILLER

What about the life readings you

picked up?

STARCK

The Event Horizon sensors show the

same thing: "Bio-readings of

indeterminate origin." Right before

that wave hit the Clark, there was

some kind of surge, right off the

scale, but now it's back to its

previous levels.

MILLER

What's causing the readings?

STARCK

I don't know, but whatever it is,

it's not the crew.

MILLER

So where is the rest of the crew?

We've been over every inch of this

ship and all we've found is blood.

Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?

MILLER

What happened here?

CUT TO:

SMITH

Captain Miller, you copy?

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?

SMITH

I've found a six inch fracture in

the outer hull. We should be able to

repair it and re-pressurize, it's

gonna take some time.

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

We don't have time, Smith. In twenty

hours we run out of air.

SMITH

Understood.

CUT TO:

MILLER

How is he?

DJ

His vitals are stable, but he's

unresponsive to stimuli. He might

wake up in fifteen minutes. He might

not wake up at all.

PETERS

What happened to him?

MILLER

DJ, take samples from these stains,

compare them to medical records, I

want to know whose blood this is.

CUT TO:

MILLER

Okay, people, there's been a change

in the mission. In less than eighteen

hours, we will run out of breathable

air. Our primary objective is now

survival. That means we focus on

repairing the Lewis and Clark and

salvaging whatever will buy us more

time.

(pause)

Our secondary objective is finding

out what happened to this ship and

its crew. Two months from now, I

fully intend to be standing in front

of the good Admiral giving my report,

and I'd like to have more than my

dick in my hands.

MILLER

Peters, I want you to go through the

ship's log, see if we can't find

some answers.

PETERS

I can use the station in Medical,

keep an eye on Justin...

MILLER

Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat

the bio-scan...

STARCK

What's the point? I'll just get the

same thing...

MILLER

Not acceptable. I want to know what's

causing those readings. If the crew

is dead, I want the bodies, I want

the crew found.

STARCK

I can reconfigure the scan for C-12,

amylase proteins.

MILLER

Do it. Dr. Weir...

WEIR

Yes.

MILLER

One of my men is down. I want to

know what happened to him.

COOPER

I told you. He was inside the Core...

COOPER

It was like... nothing was there...

and then Justin appeared and the

Core... became metal...

WEIR

(cutting him off)

No, he didn't.

COOPER

You weren't there. I saw it.

WEIR

Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you

really see, because what you're

describing is not physically

possible...

MILLER

Cooper! Enough!

MILLER

(turning on Weir)

Dr. Weir, Justin may die. Whatever

happened to him could happen to all

of us.

WEIR

I don't know what happened to Justin.

COOPER

I'm telling you, I saw it...

WEIR

What you saw could have been an

optical effect caused by gravitational

distortion.

COOPER

(turning on Weir)

I know what I saw and it wasn't a

fucking "optical effect!"

MILLER

Hold on, what's this "gravitational

distortion?"

WEIR

It's possible that a burst of gravity

waves escaped from the Core,

distorting space-time. They could be

what hit the Lewis and Clark.

MILLER

What could cause them?

(Weir doesn't answer)

What's in the Core?

WEIR

It's complicated...

MILLER

How much time do you need? We have

seventeen hours and forty-two minutes.

Now: what is in the Core?

WEIR

A black hole.

CUT TO:

WEIR

That's how the gravity drive works,

you see: it focuses the black hole's

immense gravitational power to create

the gateway. That's how the Event

Horizon travels faster than light.

STARCK

I can't believe we built this.

MILLER

It's insane.

WEIR

"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought

to be posted to this ship. It would

take the Lewis and Clark a thousand

years to reach our closest star. The

Event Horizon could be there in a

day...

MILLER

If it worked.

WEIR

If it worked, yes.

MILLER

I want this room sealed. The Second

Containment is off limits.

WEIR

There's no danger. The black hole is

contained behind three magnetic

fields, it's under control.

MILLER

Your black hole damn near ripped my

ship apart. It may have killed one

of my men.

(beat)

No one goes near that thing.

CUT TO:

PETERS

Justin...?

DENNY

Mommy...

DJ (O.S.)

Peters?

DJ

What's wrong?

PETERS

Nothing. It's nothing.

CUT TO:

COOPER

You been out there a long time. Trying

to break my record?

SMITH

I'd rather spend the next twelve

hours Outside than another five

minutes in this can. This ship is

bad. It watches you.

COOPER

What?

SMITH

You heard me. This ship, it's crazy:

trying to go faster'n light, that's

like the Tower of Babel.

COOPER

Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical

on me.

SMITH

You know what happened to the Tower

of Babel, don't you? It fell down.

COOPER

You're sucking too much nitrogen in

your mix.

CUT TO:

STARCK

Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.

WEIR

Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved

the Event Horizon more than I loved

her. I told her that wasn't true, I

just knew the Event Horizon better,

that's all.

STARCK

Claire is your wife?

WEIR

Yes.

STARCK

It must be hard, being so far away

from her.

WEIR

Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years

now.

STARCK

I'm sorry.

WEIR

These things happen.

(reacting to something

on the screen)

Wait a minute, that's not right...

MILLER

You have something, Dr. Weir?

WEIR

The date.

MILLER

What about it?

WEIR

The Event Horizon's computer think's

it's 2034.

MILLER

It's 2041...

WEIR

Exactly. The ship's internal clock

is off by seven years.

STARCK

Maybe a power interruption crashed

the system...

WEIR

No, there's no evidence of a surge

or spike of any kind. It's as if

time just... stopped for seven years.

MILLER

Explanation?

WEIR

Intense gravitational fields effect

the passage of time, it's possible...

(beat)

Black holes make sense on paper,

it's all math, you see, but as to

what really happened...

(he shakes his head)

The Event Horizon has passed beyond

our plane of reality, and like

Lazarus, returned from the dead.

PETERS (O.S.)

(intercom)

Captain Miller, Dr. Weir? I found

the final log entry.

CUT TO:

KILPACK (O.S.)

We have reached safe distance and

are preparing to engage the gravity

drive and open the gateway...

PETERS

The speaker is the mission

commander...

WEIR

(quiet)

John Kilpack.

KILPACK (O.S.)

When you get this message, God

willing, we will reach the solar

system of Proxima Centauri...

MILLER

I wonder if they ever made it.

KILPACK

I just want to say how proud I am of

my crew. I'd like to name my station

heads Chris Chambers, Janice Rubin,

Dick Smith, Tom Fender and Stacie

Collins. And to Bill Weir and all

the scientists that got us here.

KILPACK

I... uh, I had something historic to

say, and I wrote it down but I... I

can't find it. Ave, atque, vale.

Hail and farewell.

MILLER

What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?

WEIR

I don't know.

PETERS

I can run the image through a series

of filters, try to clean it up.

MILLER

Do it.

PETERS

What's happening...?

DJ

A power drain --

MILLER

We barely have enough power for life

support as it is, if we can't stop

the drain, we're not gonna make it.

WEIR

The Core...!

MILLER

Wait!

MILLER

The rest of you, stay here, I don't

want anyone else going near that

thing.

CUT TO:

MILLER

No radiation. What's causing the

drain?

WEIR

(shakes his head)

The magnetic fields are holding.

Maybe a short in the fail-safe

circuit. I'll check it out.

MILLER

We don't get the power back, our

air's gonna go bad.

WEIR

Check the Core for radiation. Carbon

dioxide may be the least of our

worries.

WEIR

E-three... E-five... E-seven... where

are you...

STARCK

What the hell...

STARCK

(into intercom)

Skipper, the bio-scan just went off

the scale...

DJ

Justin! Can you hear me? Justin!

JUSTIN

THE DARK IS COMING...

WEIR

There you are.

WEIR

Um. Captain Miller? I, uh, I seem to

have a problem with my light.

WEIR

(beat, hushed)

Captain Miller?

VOICE

Billy.

CLAIRE (O.S.)

Billy. Help me. I'm so cold.

MILLER

We just lost all power in here. Dr.

Weir...?

BURNING MAN

Don't leave me...

WEIR

(a whisper)

Claire...?

CLAIRE (O.S.)

Help me. I'm so cold.

CLAIRE

So cold.

CUT TO:

DJ

Carbon dioxide poisoning produces

hallucinations, impaired judgement...

MILLER

Goddammit, DJ, it was not a

hallucination! I saw a man, he was

on fire. And then he disappeared.

STARCK

Maybe one of the original crew?

MILLER

No. It was someone else.

STARCK

Who?

MILLER

(ignoring the question)

Dr. Weir, you were right there, you

must have heard something, seen

something...

WEIR

No. I saw nothing.

PETERS

I did.

PETERS

About an hour ago. In medical. I saw

my son. He was lying on one of the

examination tables and his legs

were...

(she trails off)

WEIR

Isn't it possible that you were

traumatized by finding the body on

the bridge?

PETERS

I've seen bodies before. This is

different.

MILLER

Peters is right. Its like something

reaching into your mind. Seeing your

thoughts and making them real. Smith,

did you or Cooper experience anything

unusual?

SMITH

I didn't see anything and I don't

have to see anything. This ship is

fucked.

WEIR

Thank you for that scientific

analysis, Mister Smith.

SMITH

(exploding)

Hey! You don't need to be a scientist

figure it out...

MILLER

Smith...

SMITH

...you break all the laws of physics,

you think there won't be a price?

You already killed the first crew...

MILLER

That's enough!

MILLER

DJ!!

DJ

I'm sorry, I... I don't know why I

did that.

WEIR

(wry)

Carbon dioxide.

SMITH

He's fucking lying, you know

something...!

MILLER

That's it, that's enough for one

day, Smith! I need you back on the

Clark, I need you calm, I need you

using your head, you make a mistake

out there, none of are getting home,

you understand?

SMITH

Sir.

MILLER

Get outside, go back to work. I'll

join you shortly.

MILLER

We're a long way from home and we're

in a bad place. Let's not make it

worse. If anyone has any constructive

suggestions, now is the time.

WEIR

I think I can stabilize the fields

around the singularity, that should

prevent another power drain.

MILLER

Do it.

DJ

To conserve our oxygen, we should

severely restrict our activity. Anyone

who can should get some sleep.

MILLER

I don't need sleep, DJ. I need

answers.

STARCK

Miller...

MILLER

(not slowing)

What is it, Starck?

STARCK

...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA

filter. The results were bio-readings

of indeterminate origin...

MILLER

(simultaneous)

"...bio-readings of indeterminate

origin," don't you have anything

useful to tell me?

STARCK

I've got a theory.

MILLER

Go ahead.

STARCK

There was a another surge in the bio-

readings right before you... you saw

what you saw. We picked up a similar

readings right before the Clarke was

damaged. What if there were a

connection between the two? The

gravity waves, the hallucination,

all part of an defensive reaction,

like an immune system...

MILLER

I don't need to hear this.

STARCK

You've got to listen...

MILLER

To what? What are you saying? This

ship is alive?

STARCK

I didn't say that, I said the bio-

readings correspond to what happened

to you, the ship is reacting to us...

MILLER

We're hanging on by our fingernails

and you're giving me bullshit

stories...

STARCK

It's not bullshit, it's the only

conclusion the data supports...

MILLER

Starck, do you know how crazy that

sounds? It's impossible.

STARCK

I know that.

MILLER

If you knew it was impossible, then

why'd you waste my time?

STARCK

I thought you wanted an answer. And

that's the only one I have.

MILLER

What I want is to survive the next

ten hours.

STARCK

(checks her watch)

Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.

MILLER

I'm going outside to work on the

Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone

what you just told me. We've got

enough to worry about.

CUT TO:

PETERS

Justin...?

PETERS

Justin!

DJ

What's wrong?

PETERS

You didn't hear it? You must have

heard it!

STARCK

Heard what?

PETERS

Oh... nothing...

DJ

Sit down...

PETERS

Stop it! Stop it!

DJ

(shouting to be heard)

What is it?

STARCK

What are you doing?

WEIR

It wants me. I have to go.

STARCK

No...!

STARCK

In our current environment, Dr. Weir,

self-control is an asset.

WEIR

I'm alright. Please.

STARCK

What is it?

WEIR

The forward airlock.

STARCK

(into radio)

Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in

the airlock?

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

That's a negative, Starck.

PETERS

(realization)

Justin.

PETERS

Justin, no!

CUT TO:

COOPER

We'll have to re-route through the

port conduit to the APU.

SMITH

What about the accumulator...?

STARCK (O.S.)

(radio)

Miller, come in...

MILLER

What's going on in there, Starck?

STARCK (O.S.)

(radio)

Justin's in the airlock.

MILLER (O.S.)

(intercom)

What?

STARCK

He's awake, he's in the airlock,

he's not wearing a suit.

MILLER

(to Cooper)

Stay here! Don't stop working!

COOPER

But Justin...

MILLER

I'll get him.

CUT TO:

STARCK

He's engaged the override.

PETERS

Can you shut it down?

STARCK

I'll try. DJ, you better get your

bag of tricks.

PETERS

Justin! Open the door!

PETERS

(muffled)

Open the door!

CUT TO:

MILLER

I'm on my way, Starck.

STARCK (O.S.)

(radio)

You better hurry. He's engaged the

override, we can't open the inner

door.

BACK TO:

PETERS

(muffled)

The door, Justin! Open the door!

JUSTIN

Did you hear it?

PETERS

Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.

STARCK

Keep him talking.

PETERS

Do you know what it was?

JUSTIN

(muffled)

It gets inside you. It shows you

things... horrible things...

JUSTIN

...can't describe it... there are no

words...

PETERS (O.S.)

(intercom)

What, Justin, what shows you?

JUSTIN (O.S.)

(intercom)

It won't stop, it goes on and on and

on...

PETERS (O.S.)

(intercom)

What does?

JUSTIN (O.S.)

(intercom)

The dark inside me.

JUSTIN (O.S.)

(radio)

...It's inside and it eats and eats

until there's nothing left.

PETERS (O.S.)

(radio)

"The dark inside..."? I don't

understand.

JUSTIN (O.S.)

(radio)

From the Other Place...

BACK TO:

JUSTIN

The other crew, they're there, they're

waiting for me. They're waiting for

you. I won't go back there... I

won't...

PETERS

Justin, look at me. Look at me. Open

this door.

STARCK

I don't think she can talk him down.

We need a sedative.

DJ

If he opens the outer door he'll

turn inside-out.

STARCK

Almost got it.

PETERS (O.S.)

(muffled)

Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...

JUSTIN

If you could see the things I've

seen, you wouldn't try to stop me.

You'd come with me.

PETERS

(muffled)

NOOO!

COMPUTER

Stand-by for decompression. Thirty

seconds...

JUSTIN

Hey, Mama-Bear... what are doing...?

JUSTIN

Oh my god OH MY GOD...

PETERS

Starck!

STARCK

I can't! The inner door can't open

once the outer door has been

triggered, it would decompress the

entire ship!

JUSTIN

(muffled)

You gotta open, you gotta stop it,

please...

PETERS

We have to do something, oh God...

STARCK

(into radio)

Skipper, Justin just activated the

door. It's on a thirty second delay...

MILLER

Patch me through to him.

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

Justin.

JUSTIN

Skipper, you gotta help me...

COMPUTER

Twenty seconds.

JUSTIN

...tell them to open the door...

MILLER (O.S.)

(radio)

They can't do that Justin, now listen

carefully...

JUSTIN

(radio)

...I don't want to die...!

MILLER

You're not going to die! Not today!

I want you to do exactly as I say

and I'm gonna get you out of there,

alright?

JUSTIN

But I can't... I gotta get out of

here... Skipper, please...

MILLER

(radio)

Justin. I won't let you die.

JUSTIN

Okay... okay...

MILLER

(radio)

Tuck yourself into a crouched

position, shut your eyes as tight as

you can!

STARCK

Five seconds.

MILLER

(radio)

Exhale everything you got, Baby Bear,

we can't have any air in those lungs,

blow it all out...

JUSTIN

Oh god --

PETERS

Oh God... Justin...

PETERS

I've got a pulse, he's alive...

DJ

Pressure?

PETERS

90 over 50 and falling... .

DJ

He's crashing...

DJ

He can breathe. That's good. Let's

get him to Medical, go, go!

CUT TO:

DJ (O.S.)

(intercom)

Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the

nitrogen out of his blood...

PETERS (O.S.)

(intercom)

His peritoneum has ruptured...

DJ (O.S.)

(intercom)

One thing at a time, let's keep him

breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's

fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding

out...

CUT TO:

DJ

He'll live... if we ever make it

back.

MILLER

We'll make it.

STARCK

CO2 levels will reach toxic levels

in four hours.

MILLER

(gently)

Peters. We need to know what happened

to the crew. Before it happens to

us.

PETERS

(weakly)

I'll get back to the log. But on the

bridge, I won't go back, back in

there...

MILLER

Thanks.

STARCK

Justin said something about, "The

dark inside me..." What did he mean?

WEIR

It means nothing.

MILLER

Is that your "expert opinion?" The

only answer we've had out of you is

"I don't know."

WEIR

Justin just tried to kill himself.

The man is clearly insane.

DJ

How would you explain your own

behavior?

WEIR

What?

STARCK

On the bridge. You said "it" wanted

you.

WEIR

I said that?

DJ

Yes. You did.

WEIR

I don't remember saying that.

(covers with a joke)

Maybe I'm insane, too.

MILLER

I want to know what caused that noise.

I want to know why one of my crew

tried to throw himself out of the

airlock.

WEIR

Thermal changes in the hull could

have caused the metal to expand and

contract very suddenly, causing

reverberations --

MILLER

(exploding)

That's bullshit and you know it! You

built this fucking ship and all I've

heard from you is bullshit!

WEIR

What do you want me to say?

MILLER

You said this ship creates a

gateway...

WEIR

Yes...

MILLER

To what? Where did this ship go?

Where did you send it?

WEIR

I don't know...

MILLER

Where has it been for the past seven

years?

WEIR

I don't know...

MILLER

The "Other Place," what is that...?

WEIR

I DON'T KNOW!

(beat, calm again)

I don't know. There's a lot of things

going on here that I don't understand.

Truth takes time.

MILLER

That's exactly what we don't have,

Doctor.

CUT TO:

VOICE (O.S.)

Don't leave me...!

CUT TO:

MILLER (O.S.)

Any change?

DJ

No. No change.

(beat)

I've analyzed Justin's blood samples.

There's no evidence of excessive

levels of carbon dioxide. Or anything

else out of ordinary.

MILLER

Of course not. Justin just climbed

into the airlock because he felt

like it. Just one of those things.

(beat)

I swore I'd never lose another man.

I came close today. Real close.

DJ

"Another man?" Who?

MILLER

It was on the Goliath. There was

this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a

lot like Justin. Edmund Corrick,

from Decatur, Georgia. He got caught

when the pressure doors sealed, one

closed on his arm. Severed it at the

wrist. The pain of that must have

been... He passed out and...

MILLER

I, I tried to go back for him, to

save him, but I couldn't get to him

in time. The fire... Have you ever

seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like

a liquid, it slides over everything.

It was like a wave breaking over

him, a wave of fire. And then he was

gone.

(beat)

I never told anyone until now. But

this ship knew, DJ. It knows about

the Goliath, it knows about Corrick.

It knows our secrets. It knows what

we're afraid of.

(beat, wan smile)

And now you're going to tell me it's

carbon dioxide.

DJ

No.

MILLER

What is it?

DJ

I've been listening to the

transmission. And I think Houston

made a mistake in the translation.

MILLER

Go on.

DJ

They thought it said, "Liberatis

me," "Save me," but it's not "me."

It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."

MILLER

It's not a distress call. It's a

warning.

DJ

It gets worse.

DJ

It's very hard to make out, but listen

to this final part.

DJ

Do you hear it? Right there.

MILLER

Hear what?

DJ

It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex,"

from; "infera," the ablative case of

"inferi." "Hell."

MILLER

"Save yourself. From Hell."

(beat)

What are you saying, are you saying

that this ship is possessed?

DJ

No. I don't believe in that sort of

thing.

(beat)

But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship

has passed beyond the boundaries of

our universe, of reality. Who knows

where this ship has been... What

it's seen...

(beat)

And what it's brought back with it.

COOPER (O.S.)

(intercom)

Captain Miller, we're ready to

repressurize the Clark.

MILLER

(into intercom)

On my way.

CUT TO:

MILLER

Alright, Cooper.

COOPER

Cross your fingers.

SMITH (O.S.)

(radio)

It's holding... She's holding...!

COOPER (O.S.)

(radio)

We're still venting trace gasses,

gimme twenty minutes to plug the

hole.

MILLER

You got it, Coop.

MILLER

Back in business.

CUT TO:

PETERS

You got any coffee?

STARCK

It's cold.

PETERS

I don't care.

PETERS

(tiny voice)

Starck...

PETERS

Sweet Jesus. Miller... MILLER!

CUT TO:

KILPACK

Liberatis tutemet ex infera...

MILLER

We're leaving.

WEIR

You can't, your orders are specific...

MILLER

"...to rescue the crew and salvage

the ship." The crew is dead, Dr.

Weir. This ship killed them. And now

it's killing us.

WEIR

You're insane. You've lost your mind.

MILLER

Maybe you're right. But it's still

my command, and I have leeway to

abort when I feel there is an

unacceptable threat to my crew. And

I think there is.

(beat)

Starck, download all the files from

the Event Horizon's computers. Coop,

Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers

back onto the Clark.

WEIR

(stammering)

Don't... don't do this...

MILLER

It's done.

CUT TO:

SMITH

What's going on, sweethearts?

PETERS

CO2 scrubbers for the Clark. Miller

pulled the plug on the mission.

SMITH

About goddam time.

WEIR

What about my ship?

MILLER

We will take the Lewis and Clark to

a safe distance and then launch tac

missiles at the Event Horizon until

I am satisfied that she has been

destroyed.

(beat)

Fuck this ship.

WEIR

You... You can't do that!

MILLER

Watch me.

WEIR

You can't kill her, I won't let you!

I lost her once, I will not lose her

again...!

STARCK (O.S.)

(intercom)

Miller, come in ...

MILLER

Starck, what the hell is going on?

STARCK

(into intercom)

We just lost main power again.

MILLER

Goddammit! Starck, get those files

and vacate. I want off this ship.

WEIR

You can't leave. She won't let you.

MILLER

Just get your gear back onto the

Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll

find yourself looking for a ride

home.

WEIR (O.S.)

I am home.

MILLER

Weir? WEIR!

MILLER

All hands. Dr. Weir is missing. I

want him found and restrained.

SMITH

Let's go, let's go, this place freaks

me out...

PETERS

Last one.

PETERS

(whisper)

Denny?

PETERS

Smith.

DENNY (O.S.)

Mommy...

PETERS

Denny...?

CUT TO:

MILLER

(to his ship)

Thank you.

SMITH (O.S.)

(radio)

Captain, we got a problem.

MILLER

Now what?

CUT TO:

SMITH

She was right behind me, I turn

around, she's gone. She could be

anywhere.

MILLER

Alright. Prep the Clark for launch.

I'll find her.

CUT TO:

PETERS

Denny? Denny, come to Mommy...

PETERS

Hold on, Denny, Mommy's coming...

PETERS

Denny?

PETERS

Denny...?

DENNY

Mommy...

PETERS

You can walk... Denny, you can walk...

oh, my baby...

DENNY

Wanna show you, Mommy, wanna show

you something...

PETERS

(bloody gasp)

Denny...

CUT TO:

WEIR

(to himself)

I won't. I won't leave. This is my

ship.

WEIR

Oh no. Peters...?

WEIR

Why did you do that? You didn't have

to do that...

CLAIRE (O.S.)

Billy.

COOPER

Solid as a rock.

(into his radio)

Hey, Smith...

COOPER (O.S.)

(intercom)

Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm

coming in.

SMITH

Roger that.

SMITH

Dr. Weir! Hey, get your ass back on

board! Dr. Weir!

SMITH

Skipper, come in...

SMITH (O.S.)

(intercom)

Skipper...

MILLER

(into intercom)

What is it, Smith?

SMITH (O.S.)

(intercom)

I just saw Weir, I think he was

messing around on the Clark.

MILLER

Smith, get out of there...

SMITH (O.S.)

(intercom)

Come again, Skipper?

MILLER

One of the explosives is missing

from the corridor. I think Weir may

have put it on the Clark.

MILLER (O.S.)

(intercom)

Get off the Clark now and wait for

me at the airlock.

SMITH

No, no, we just got her back

together...

MILLER (O.S.)

(intercom)

Get out of there now!

SMITH

Where is it, where is it...

MILLER

Smith? Smith! Fuck!

SMITH

I gotcha... I gotcha...

SMITH

I gotcha.

MILLER

NOOO!

MILLER

DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper

are dead.

DJ

What happened?

MILLER (O.S.)

(intercom)

Weir. He used one of the explosives

from the Corridor.

MILLER

DJ, you read me?

MILLER (O.S.)

(intercom)

DJ? DJ, come in...

MILLER

Peters...

MILLER (O.S.)

(intercom)

Peters, are you there?

MILLER

(growing panic)

Starck, do you read me? Starck...?

WEIR (O.S.)

(intercom)

I told you... She won't let you

leave...

MILLER

Son of a bitch!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MILLER

Oh my God.

DJ

(whisper)

Please...

MILLER

Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do

I...

DJ

Please... kill...

MILLER

Oh God...

CUT TO:

MILLER

Weir.

MILLER

Hold on... Get you outta these...

MILLER

Your eyes...

WEIR

I don't need them anymore. Where

we're going, we won't need eyes to

see.

MILLER

What are you talking about?

WEIR

Do you know what a singularity is,

Miller? Does your mind truly fathom

what a black hole is?

(beat)

It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal

NOTHING. And if God is Everything,

then I have seen the Devil.

(a dead man's grin)

It's a liberating experience.

COMPUTER

Gravity drive primed. Do you wish to

engage?

MILLER

What are you doing?

COMPUTER

Gravity drive engaged. Activation in

T-minus ten minutes.

MILLER

If you miss me, you'll blow out the

hull. You'll die too.

WEIR

What makes you think I'll miss?

STARCK (O.S.)

Don't leave me!

STARCK

(gasping for air)

Please... help, help me...

MILLER

Give me your hand! Your hand!

MILLER

The forward airlock.

STARCK

Weir can't be alive.

MILLER

Whatever was on that bridge wasn't

Weir.

MILLER

Stay behind me.

STARCK

Cooper!

COOPER

Let me breathe, let me breathe...

STARCK

You're okay now, it's over...

MILLER

(sees something)

It's not over. It's just starting.

MILLER

Weir activated the drive. He's sending

us to the Other Place.

STARCK

We've got to shut it down, we've got

to...

COOPER

How? The Bridge is gone.

STARCK

There must be a way! What about

Engineering?

COOPER

Can you shut it down?

STARCK

I don't know the process, Dr. Weir

was the expert...

COOPER

I don't want to go where the last

crew went. I'd rather be dead.

MILLER

BLOW THE FUCKER UP.

STARCK

Blow it up?

MILLER

We blow the Corridor. Use the

foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it

from the rest of the ship. We stay

put...

COOPER

...and the gravity drive goes where

no man has gone before.

CUT TO:

MILLER

You prep the gravity couches. I'm

going to manually arm those

explosives.

COOPER

Will it work?

MILLER

It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.

STARCK

I'll do it --

MILLER

No. I'll be right back.

MILLER

Close it behind me. Just in case.

STARCK

Don't be long.

COOPER

I'm gonna activate the emergency

beacon.

STARCK

Hurry.

STARCK

Cooper...!

COOPER

Starck?

COOPER

What...?

STARCK

Run!

MILLER

We're armed. This fucker's ready to

blow...

MILLER (O.S.)

(intercom)

...repeat, we're armed...

STARCK

Miller, he's back, he was in the

tank...

MILLER

Slow down, Starck, I can't understand

you, who was in the tank?

STARCK (O.S.)

(intercom)

You have to get back here now, he's

out there now, if he finds you...

MILLER

Who? Who?

STARCK (O.S.)

(intercom)

Weir.

MILLER

He's dead...

MILLER

You're dead, I saw you die.

WEIR

Weir is dead.

MILLER

Then who the fuck are you?

WEIR

Your fear. Do you remember the

Goliath, Miller?

BURNING MAN

Do you remember me?

MILLER

Corrick...

BURNING MAN

You left me behind.

MILLER

That's not true...

BURNING MAN

I begged you. I begged you to save

me and you did nothing. You stood

there and watched me burn...

MILLER

SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

BURNING MAN (O.S.)

Don't leave me!

MILLER

You're not Edmund Corrick.

MILLER

What are you?

WEIR

You know.

MILLER

You want me to believe you're the

Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!

WEIR

I'm not the Devil.

MILLER

Then what, what are you? Tell me...

WEIR

Better if I just show you.

MILLER

NO!

MILLER

You can't have them!

WEIR

I'm not the Devil. I'm much, much

older. I watched the Beginning and I

will see the End. I am the dark behind

the stars. I am the dark inside you

all.

MILLER

...not the Devil...

WEIR

There is no Devil. There is no God.

There is only... NOTHING.

MILLER

You're lying...!

WEIR

I'm not asking you to believe me.

You'll see for yourself... and so

will your crew. You're all coming

with me.

MILLER

Starck... Cooper...

WEIR

They are mine. And so are you...

MILLER

(a grim smile of

triumph)

You can't have them. Go to hell.

WEIR

NOOO!

STARCK

Miller...

FADE TO:

COOPER

It's over, hush now, it's over...

END
