Simone by Andrew Niccol

SIMONE

by

Andrew Niccol

P.A.

Mr. Taransky --

VIKTOR

She's walking?... Don't tell me

she's walking.

(blood slowly draining

from his face)

She is not walking... She can't

walk.

VIKTOR

-- Nicola!  How was your massage?

NICOLA

You're in breach.

VIKTOR

-- Is this about the new pages? --

I made the changes you wanted,

you're in virtually every scene --

NICOLA

(wheeling on him)

It's not the size of the role,

Viktor.

(suddenly very cool)

Am I or am I not contractually

entitled to the biggest trailer on

the set?

VIKTOR

(regarding the enormous

silver fish behind them,

confused)

It's the biggest on earth!  I

swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream --

they don't make them any longer

than that.

NICOLA

Taller, Viktor.

VIKTOR

Taller?  What?

NICOLA

(walking away)

You've insulted me for the last

time.

VIKTOR

Nicola, it's just the tires --

they're over-inflated!  I can fix

it!

VIKTOR

See, it's lower already.

VIKTOR

I beg you.  You can't do this to

me.

NICOLA

(looking back)

I had three other offers.  I only

signed on to this picture out of...

loyalty.

VIKTOR

Then show some.  They'll shut me

down!

NICOLA

(opening the car door)

It wasn't working anyhow.  The

scene with the thousand geese -- I

don't understand this film.  I

don't think anyone will understand

it.  I already put out a press

release -- citing "creative

differences".

VIKTOR

You know what, Nicola, you're

right.

(picking up her last piece

of luggage)

Here, let me help you with that.

(holding the door for her)

You ought to go.  The truth is I

don't deserve you.  This film

doesn't deserve you.  Frankly, it

deserves much, much better.  The

reason it's not working is because

you're not about the work.

VIKTOR

(to the limo driver)

To Hell, please.

VIKTOR

(to the crew)

What are you looking at?  Get back

to work.

NICOLA

(whispered)

Jack... are you there?

HAL

I'm here.  I'm right beside you.

NUN

(to Hal)

You should really go now.

NICOLA

No, it's alright.  Please, let him

stay.

HAL

(a glance to heaven)

What kind of cruel God is it that

would take you away from me?

NICOLA

The same one who brought me to you.

HAL

No... I cannot accept it.  If

something like this can happen.

What...

(struggling to find the

words)

What is it for?

NICOLA

(smiles through her pain)

-- Why are we here?  Is that what

you're asking, Jack?... Why are we

here?  No why.  Just here.

EXECUTIVE 1

She's good.  You can hardly tell

she's reading off a teleprompter.

VIKTOR

(ignoring him)

I've analyzed the footage.  We've

got almost everything we need in

the can.  If we rework the script,

we can finish the film without her.

EXECUTIVE 2

(forceful shake of the

head)

According to the writ her attorneys

filed at noon today.  They'll sue

if the film is released with Nicola

in a single frame.

VIKTOR

(more anxious)

So we'll re-cast.

HAL

Nicola Anders is the only actress

who can play that role.

VIKTOR

(incredulous)

It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not

bigger than this picture.

ELAINE

Of course she is.  No other name is

going to sign on now and risk

offending her.

VIKTOR

We don't need a name.  We'll cast

an unknown.

HAL

I won't play opposite an unknown.

ELAINE

We can't sell an unknown.  Nicola's

soured on the project and we have

to accept that.  If we ever want to

be in the Nicola Anders business

again, we have to cut our losses

and shelve the picture.

VIKTOR

(aghast)

No!  You will not give in to that

blackmailing bitch!

ELAINE

(a wince, addressing

everyone but Viktor)

Excuse us.

ELAINE

God, Viktor.  Why do you always

have to make things so difficult

for yourself?

VIKTOR

Difficult.  I'm difficult.

VIKTOR

(referring to the candy)

-- Do you know what these are,

Elaine?

ELAINE

(talking a piece of candy

and eating it)

Hmm... Mike and Ike's.

VIKTOR

Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry

Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I,

Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy

Award nominated director --

ELAINE

-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.

VIKTOR

-- overseeing the most cherished

movie project of my career, am

walking around with a pocketful of

cherry Mike & Ike's?

ELAINE

-- I have a feeling you're going to

tell me.

VIKTOR

-- I'll tell you why.  It is

because Miss Nicola Anders,

supermodel with a SAG card God's

gift to cinema, has it written into

her contract that all cherry Mike &

Ike's be removed from her candy

dish along with strict instructions

that any room she walks into should

have seven packs of cigarettes

waiting for her three of them

opened, that there be a personal

jacuzzi within eighty paces of her

dressing room, and that any time

she travels, her nanny must fly

with her first class.

ELAINE

-- What's wrong with that?

VIKTOR

Elaine, she doesn't have any

children!

(grabbing her arm)

Don't you see?  We're being held

hostage by 12 men and 5 women who

someone somewhere has decreed are

the A-list.

ELAINE

The public decides who's on that

list.

VIKTOR

Please.

ELAINE

It's the truth.  Those 17

superstars are our insurance

policy.  We can't open -- can't

make a profit without them.

VIKTOR

We can hardly make a profit with

them.  Up-front salary, back-end

deal, perks, per diem, percentages

-- They're mocking us, Elaine.

We're at their mercy.

(staring wistful, into

space)

We always had movie stars but they

used to be our stars.  We used to

decide who would play what role.

We told them what to wear, what to

say, who to date.  When they were

under contract, we could change

their names if we wanted to -- more

than once!

ELAINE

(regarding him as if he's

insane)

You realize you're nostalgic for an

era you weren't even born in?

VIKTOR

(irritated at her

infuriating logic)

Well, I do remember why I started

out in this business -- you seem to

have forgotten -- working in New

York with Cassevetes -- we were

trying to do something important,

shine a light in that darkened

cinema --

ELAINE

(rolling her eyes)

-- It's called a projector.

VIKTOR

(ignoring her)

-- Illuminate hearts and minds with

a ray of truth.

ELAINE

Listen, Viktor, I have good

memories of those days too -- but

this isn't about that or you or me

or some high-minded ideal.  This is

business.

VIKTOR

Spare me.

ELAINE

(gesturing at the studio

lot)

-- Christ, Viktor, look around.

What do you think pays for all

this?  This is about investment and

return.  Those days in New York...

that's... it's over.

VIKTOR

You're not renewing my contract.

ELAINE

How can I?  Your last three

pictures tanked.  The board is

giving me hell.  No bankable star

will work with you after this.  If

you just compromised... a little.

VIKTOR

(rueful smile)

-- Well, it's not every day you're

fired by the mother of your own

child.

ELAINE

(softening, a heart-to

heart)

I'm not taking away your daughter,

just your deal.  You and I both

know, after the divorce I kept you

on for old time's sake, so you

could still hold your head up in

front of Lainey.  I called what's

his name at Warner's.  He said he'd

take a meeting -- in July.  I've

fought for you Viktor...

(voice trails off)

You want to talk severance?

VIKTOR

(staring off into the

distance, face hardening)

You can have everything -- office,

car, assistants -- all I want is

the picture.

ELAINE

(confused)

The picture's dead.

VIKTOR

So there's no problem -- I can have

the rights, the negative too?

ELAINE

(believing she's getting

off lightly)

They're yours.  But how are you

going to finish it?  Without a star

there's no movie.

VIKTOR

I don't need a star.  All I need is

an actor -- I'll reshoot the part,

cut out Nicola and replace her with

a real actor.  A real leading lady.

ELAINE

Even if you find her, you know the

problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If

they're good, they get known.  And

then you're back to sorting their

candy... and worse.

(kissing him on the cheek

as she departs in her

studio golf cart)

I'm sorry, Viktor.

LAINEY

Hi, Dad.

VIKTOR

(slightly ashamed)

Hello, sweetheart.

LAINEY

I'm sorry Mom canned you.

VIKTOR

(shrugging)

It's really... not anything,

Lainey.  It's just --

LAINEY

Don't feel too bad.

(glancing to a standee)

Mom runs the place and they still

walk all over her.  You're better

off out of it.

VIKTOR

(regarding his daughter)

You look very grown up.  What are

you doing?  You meeting your mom

for dinner?

LAINEY

(reluctant admission)

Kent got tickets to the ballet.

VIKTOR

(trying to convince

himself as much as

Lainey)

I'm going to finish the picture,

sweetheart.  It's important.

LAINEY

(not quite convinced)

I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're

Viktor Taransky.

VIKTOR

(to himself)

That's right.  I'm Viktor Taransky.

KENT

You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a

liability.

ELAINE

(wistful look to Viktor)

He also happens to be the most

talented man I've ever known.

TARANSKY CALLS A-LIST:

"OVER-PRICED, OVER-PAMPERED PRIMA DONNAS"

- Director's Future Now In Doubt -

TOUR GUIDE

-- On your left, the house where

Claris Commodore uttered those now

immortal words, "If that door

doesn't hold, stand behind me".

And coming up on your right --

HANK

-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky...

thank God.  I've been trying to see

you, calling -- Your assistant

wouldn't put me through.  I told

her it was a matter of life and

death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get

to you in time --

VIKTOR

(using his stack of film

cans as a barrier)

-- Please, get away from me.

HANK

I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked

skin.  I licked hair.  I licked

every part of her.

VIKTOR

(more disturbed, fearing

he is dealing with a

pervert)

You want me to call Security?

HANK

I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The

answer to your prayers.

(producing the "Variety"

article, conspiratorial)

The answer to this.

VIKTOR

(regarding the article)

I was misquoted.

HANK

I have your new leading lady...

(indicating the bulge in

his pocket)

... right here in my pants.

HANK

(trying to reassure)

It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you

recognize me? -- The Future of

Film conference in San Jose.

Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote

speaker.  You must remember my

speech... "Who Needs Humans?"

VIKTOR

(faint glimmer of

recognition)

That's right.  You were booed off

the stage.  That's got to be -- ?

HANK

-- Eight years ago.  In that whole

time, I never left my computer.

VIKTOR

(wary)

Good for you, Hank.

HANK

(referring to his covered

eye)

Good and bad.  They think that's

what caused this.  Me eye tumor.

Microwaves from the screen.  It's

the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy

too.

VIKTOR

(regarding the pathetic

figure with the tilted

head)

I'm sorry.

HANK

Don't be.  It was worth it.

HANK

You have to see her.

VIKTOR

(loading cans into the

car)

I've seen them all before.

HANK

Not like this --

VIKTOR

(patronizing smile)

Come on, Hank.  A synthespian,

virtual actor -- ?

HANK

(irritated)

-- We call them "vactors".

VIKTOR

I need flesh and --

HANK

-- Flesh is weak.

VIKTOR

-- a living, breathing actor -- I

can't work with a fake.

HANK

(pointing to Nicola in

Variety)

You already do.  But my actor won't

get old, fat, lazy or drunk --

won't throw tantrums, demand a body

double, script changes or a bigger

trailer.

(whispers, conspiratorial)

The Disney Corporation has been

using artificial actors for years.

VIKTOR

That's the point, Hank.  No matter

how good they are, they're still

Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried.

Everyone's failed.  It can't be

done.

HANK

It can -- with my new computer

code, you and me, we can do it

together.

VIKTOR

I don't know anything about

computers.

HANK

That's why you're so perfect.  You

have something I don't have.

VIKTOR

What's that?

HANK

An eye -- for performance.  You

know the truth when you see it.  I

know.  I've seen your movies.  I

love your movies.

VIKTOR

You do?

HANK

"Straw God" changed my life.

VIKTOR

You saw that?

HANK

I've seen every frame of your work.

You're the only filmmaker in

Hollywood with the artistic

integrity to realize my vision.

You and me, art and science... we

are the perfect marriage.

VIKTOR

Listen, Hank, it's been a rough

day.

(climbing into his car)

I'll call you about his next week.

HANK

(at the car window)

I won't be here next week.  The

tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.

VIKTOR

(winding down the window)

I'm already dead.

HANK

Call me.

(looking at his watch)

This week!

VIKTOR

(into phone, referring to

a young woman's headshot)

-- What do you mean she won't work

with me?  She's done nothing.  She

doesn't have a single credit --

AGENT'S VOICE

(from phone, off-camera)

-- Better no credits than a

Taransky credit.  No young actress

is going to step into Nicola

Anders' shoes and risk ending her

career before it's even started.

VIKTOR

-- Art, you don't understand.  I've

mortgaged everything to finish this

film -- creditors calling, coming

to the house, for God's sake, I

need this --

VIKTOR

-- Damn.

MAN IN THE SUIT

Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky --

VIKTOR

(calling back)

I'm not him.

MAN IN THE SUIT

Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the

estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.

(showing him Hank's

obituary in the L.A.

Times)

It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that

you have this.

VIKTOR

What is it?

MAN IN THE SUIT

I have no idea, Sir.  He wanted you

to have it.

SIX MONTHS LATER

VIKTOR

Want to see a free movie?

HOMELESS MAN

(he thinks)

No.

LAINEY

(kissing him hello)

Hi, Dad.

VIKTOR

Hello, Lainey.

VIKTOR

Your mother couldn't make it?

LAINEY

She's at the premiere of "A Cold

Day In Hell".  But I think she send

someone from Acquisitions.

VIKTOR

She still with Kent?

LAINEY

This week anyhow.

VIKTOR

Not quite how I imagined it --

LAINEY

(looking on the bright

side)

-- You finished the film on your

own terms, that's what matters.

Did you really do all the post

yourself?

VIKTOR

There was no other way.

LAINEY

I missed you.  I wondered if you

were ever coming back.

VIKTOR

Me too.

LAINEY

(regarding the makeshift

poster, trying to lift

his spirits)

Well, I can't wait to meet

Simone... what's her last name?

VIKTOR

You know, I... don't know.

LAINEY

Is she here tonight?

VIKTOR

She can't watch herself.

THEATER OWNER

-- Hey, we have to start.  I've got

"Tough Love 2" playing at ten.

HAL

Valarie!  VALARIE!

HAL

(ON SCREEN, approaching)

Valarie, what are you running from?

SIMONE

(enigmatic smile)

From Valarie.

HAL

(running to her)

Valarie!  No!

SIMONE

-- Why are we here?  Is that what

you're asking, Jack?... Why are we

here?  No why.  Just here.

A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY

VIKTOR

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I

may be guilty of a crime, but it

was committed with the purest of

intentions, to send a message to

the acting community who put

themselves above the work and

above --

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1

(continuing their

conversation from the

lobby)

-- So fake.

AUDIENCE MEMBER 2

-- Totally artificial.

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1

We're really supposed to believe

that was 19th Century Lisbon?

AUDIENCE MEMBER 3

Who's looking at the sets when she

is on the screen?

LAINEY

(pointing out her father)

There he is.  That's my dad, Viktor

Taransky.

AUDIENCE MEMBER 4

-- She is magnificent.

AUDIENCE MEMBER 5

-- Absolutely unreal.

VIKTOR

She wasn't too... cartoony?

AUDIENCE MEMBER 6

-- Who?  The nun?

AUDIENCE MEMBER 7

-- Or are you talking about the

mother?

AUDIENCE MEMBER 8

-- A star like that, who cares

about the supporting cast?

AUDIENCE MEMBER 9

-- Congratulations again.  She

was... not of this earth.  You

should be very proud.

VIKTOR

"Not of this earth".  A good way of

putting it.  And the film as a

whole -- ?

LAINEY

She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did

you find her?

VIKTOR

(vague)

I saw her picture on the, er...

internet.

(interrogating his

daughter's face)

You really didn't notice anything --

unusual?

LAINEY

Only her brilliance.  To be honest,

with what you had to work with, I

was expecting a train wreck.  You

really pulled it off.

LAINEY

I have a feeling mom is going to

take you back after this.

LAINEY

Back on the lot.

ELAINE (V.O.)

Viktor, you bastard!  I hear it's

great.

(beat)

Seriously, I'm happy for you.

ELAINE (V.O.)

I know people are going to be

beating down your door but... well,

I'd love the chance to buy back

something I gave away for free.

Don't you just love Hollywood?...

BEEP.

little-known director, Viktor

Tarinsky.

VIKTOR

Taransky.

ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER

(from the TV)

He has parlayed his relationship

with the new sensation into a three

picture deal with the very studio

that dumped him only six months

ago.  And no wonder with the

starlet's performance breaking all

box office records.

MOB

Simone!  SIMONE!  I LOVE YOU!  I

Want to BE you!

ELAINE

Simone!... Simone?

ELAINE

(re-emerging from the car)

Where is she?

VIKTOR

Good to see you too, Elaine.

ELAINE

(ignoring his sarcasm)

Why isn't she with you?

VIKTOR

Why?  Because she would never show

up at something like this.  She's

intensely private.

ELAINE

(dismissing her

colleagues)

Back to work, everyone.  She's not

here.

ELAINE

Viktor... I want to thank you for

convincing Simone to sign with the

studio.

VIKTOR

Don't thank me.  It was entirely

Simone's decision.  Do you have

Simone's check?

ELAINE

I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it

means a lot.

(quickly changing tack)

Have you read the reviews?  They're

love letters.

(reading from a newspaper)

Listen to this one.  "Simone has

the voice of a young Jane Fonda,

the body of Sophia Loren, the grace

of, well, Grace Kelley, and the

face of Audrey Hepburn combined

with an angel".

VIKTOR

(musing to himself)

Almost right.

ELAINE

I can't wait to meet her.

VIKTOR

I don't know if that's going to

happen.

ELAINE

(confused)

Why not?

VIKTOR

As I say, she's... something of a

recluse.  That's how she's able to

stay so pure -- by isolating

herself in her art.

ELAINE

(face falling)

Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a

press conference.

VIKTOR

Out of the question.  A circus like

that?

ELAINE

Viktor, it's my studio.

VIKTOR

She's my actor.  There are other

studios, Elaine.  There's only one

Simone.

(leaving her on the steps)

Leave the press conference to me.

VIKTOR

(tapping the microphone)

Is this on?

REPORTER 1

Who are you?

VIKTOR

Taransky, Viktor.  T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y,

V-i-k-t-o-r.

REPORTER 1

Yeah, but -- who are you?

VIKTOR

(patronizing smile)

I am a two-time Academy Award

nominated director with over

eighteen films to my credit thus

far including my latest release,

"Sunrise, Sunset".  Who are you?

VIKTOR

I will not be taking any questions.

However I do have a statement to

read on behalf of my leading lady,

Simone.

(reading from his

statement)

"To Whom It May Concern.  I'm

deeply grateful for the

extraordinary public response to

Mr. Taransky's film.  At this time

I will be conducting no interviews

or making publicity appearances

since I am really nothing without

the beautiful worlds and characters

Mr. Taransky creates for me.  I

politely request that the press

respect my privacy and let the work

speak for itself.  All questions

and inquiries should be directed to

Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all

aspects of my career.  Yours very

truly, Simone".

REPORTER 2

-- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone

dating?

REPORTER 3

-- Viktor, where'd you find her?

REPORTER 4

-- Is Simone her real name?

REPORTER 5

-- What's she got to hide?

REPORTER 1

-- Is she the new Garbo?

REPORTER 2

-- Who's Garbo?

VIKTOR

I thought I made it clear -- no

questions regarding Simone.

(bringing the press

conference to a hasty

conclusion)

Now, I would like to close by

announcing that Miss Simone begins

production today on her next film,

"Eternity Forever".  This project

has been near and dear to my heart

since I wrote it nine years ago.

(a tinge of bitterness,

then a smile)

I Thank you.

VOICE (O.S.)

Who do you think you're fooling,

Taransky?

VIKTOR

Do I know you?

MAX

Max Sayer -- National Echo.

VIKTOR

(regaining his composure,

a smirk)

Don't you have a real story to

write?  Why aren't you in Latin

America?

MAX

This is the story.

VIKTOR

I remember when the Echo had class

-- the paper that could bring down

governments.

MAX

Our leaders aren't presidents

anymore -- they're pop stars and

screen idols.  If Woodward and

Bernstein were alive today, they'd

be right here in Hollywood with me.

VIKTOR

They are alive, Sayer.

MAX

So they're probably here.

(hardly missing a beat)

You might be able to sell this

'disappearing act' to the rest of

the world, but I'm not buying it.

What's really behind this Simone

woman?  The public has a right to

know.  Why is she staying out of

sight?  And why the hell is she

with you?  I don't want you to take

this the wrong way, Viktor, but

you're not exactly Cecil B.

DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.

VIKTOR

Maybe the reason she's with me is a

little thing called integrity,

Sayer.  Look it up.

MAX

(calling after him)

Oh, I know all about integrity.  I

know even more about persistence.

Look that one up.

SECURITY GUARD

No one came in or went out just

like you said, Mr. Taransky.

VIKTOR

Good.

SECURITY GUARD

Is Miss Simone coming today?

VIKTOR

She's already here.  She arrived

before you and she'll leave long

after you've gone.

(admonishing guard)

Remember, under no circumstances

are you or any other person to

enter the set without my express

permission.

SECURITY GUARD

What if it catches on fire?

VIKTOR

Let it burn.  Simone would rather

go up in flames than give up her

privacy.

VIKTOR

(to himself as he inserts

his Hollywood hard-drive

-- SIMULATION ONE)

Pay no attention to the man behind

the computer.

Welcome

to

SIMULATION ONE

Welcome

to

SIMONE

VIKTOR

(to the screen)

Good morning, Simone.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

Good morning, Mr. Taransky.

VIKTOR

A star is...

SIMONE / VIKTOR

... digitized.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

You mean they buy it?

VIKTOR

(nervous smile as he

examines his first

royalty check)

Buy it?  They're paying for it.

And around here that's how you

really know they buy it.

VIKTOR

I'm only sorry Hank isn't here to

see this.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

(depressing the button

every time he wants to

express his thoughts

through Simone)

Maybe he can.

VIKTOR

Do you have any idea what this

means, Simone?  Our ability to

manufacture fraud now exceeds our

ability to detect it.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

(appearing to indulge

Viktor with a smile)

I am the death of real.

VIKTOR

(pondering the enormity of

the hoax)

You are birth of... what?  A

Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era

in show business.  All I wanted to

do was finish the film.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

And now look what you've started.

And now look what you've started.

And now look what you've started.

VIKTOR

Hmm... a little less Streep, a

little more Bacall.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

Is that better, Mr. Taransky?

VIKTOR

Yes.  Yes, it is.

VIKTOR

While I think of it, I'd like you

to add something to your repertoire

-- remember that thing Hepburn does

in "Breakfast At Tiffany's".

AUDREY HEPBURN

(from the screen, an

incomparable smile)

Hi.

VIKTOR

(pausing the moment)

Let's hear you say "Hi" like

Audrey.

SIMONE

(imitating Audrey's

performance perfectly)

Hi.

VIKTOR

Perfect.

(stretching)

God, I'm so relaxed around you.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

You did create me.

VIKTOR

No.  I... just helped bring someone

else's dream to life.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

Mr. Taransky, we both know I was

nothing without you.  I was

computer code -- ones and zeros.

VIKTOR

You're right.  You're right.  Of

course, one doesn't want to boast.

It's a classic case of technology

in search of an artist.  That's all

you've been waiting for, an artist

with integrity, with a vision, who

can see.

VIKTOR

See beyond that irrational

allegiance to flesh and blood. --

See that with the rise in price of

a real actor and the fall in price

of a fake, the scales have tipped

in favor of the fake.

(voice raising in

excitement)

-- See that if the performance is

genuine, it doesn't matter if the

actor is real.  Once a performance

is committed to film, the blood and

bones are gone anyway.  Only the

spirit, the illusion remains.

Besides, what's real anymore?

These days most actors have digital

work done to them so it's a gray

area.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

(Simone appears to look

directly at her maker)

Are you ever going to tell the

truth about me, Mr. Taransky?

VIKTOR

The only real truth is in the work.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

You know what I'm talking about.

VIKTOR

Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the

truth about you, why wouldn't I...?

(pondering his own

question)

Of course, with Hank's tragic

passing, the secret died with him.

(shaking the thought from

his head)

I am going to tell the truth...

after your next picture.

VIKTOR

Speaking of which -- this is the

project I'd like you to do next.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The

legendary unproduced script that

was too good ever to get made?  I'd

kill for that part.

VIKTOR

I was hoping you'd say that.

SIMONE

I'll do anything to please you, Mr.

Taransky.

VIKTOR

(pretending to be hard of

hearing)

I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

What did you say?

SIMONE

I'll do anything to please you, Mr.

Taransky.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

And I will never, ever leave you.

VIKTOR

You're so beautiful.  Too

beautiful.

VALET MANAGER

-- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky.

We gave you a complimentary car

wash -- they're washing the engine

now.

TALENT AGENT

Viktor!  Look, I'm sorry I didn't

call you back last year.  I was,

er... out of the country.

(strained moment)

But we should get together.  My

schedule's wide open.

VIKTOR

Sure, I'll... "call you".

HAL

Viktor, I'm so happy for us!

VIKTOR

Hello, Hal.

HAL

The film.  The chemistry.  No

reflections on Nicola but Simone

and I -- we were just so right

together.

VIKTOR

You never were together, Hal.

HAL

And still the connection was

undeniable.

(aside)

I haven't read "Eternity Forever"

but I know it's brilliant.  And I

know I would be perfect for Clive.

VIKTOR

(correcting him)

Clyde.

HAL

Yes, perfect.

(lowering his voice)

As a matter of fact, I ran into

Simone on the lot the other day.

VIKTOR

(genuinely startled)

Really?  She didn't mention it.

HAL

(quickly covering)

I'm sure she's meeting with a lot

of people right now.

(under his breath)

She is just as you described her,

Viktor... indescribable.  I

strongly sensed she thought I was

right for it.

VIKTOR

(answering the phone he

has just dialed, louder

than necessary)

Hello?... SIMONE!  How are you,

sweetheart?

VIKTOR

(winking to Hal)

You'll never guess who I'm with...

you ran into him on the lot.

HAL

It was more in passing.

VIKTOR

You're so far off!

(finally chuckles)

Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co-

star.  Remember now?... No, I don't

think he's put on weight.

(a shrug of apology to the

appalled Hal)

Anyway, you think he's right for

"Eternity Forever"?... not the

right type?... a different

direction...

(covering phone, to Hal)

I'll try to talk her into it.

VIKTOR

(into phone)

... Listen this is a bad place to

talk... what?... sweetheart, I know

you have charity work you want to

do, I know you want to give back --

but remember, your greatest gift is

your talent... we'll talk about it

at the beach house this weekend...

I'm looking forward to it too.

VIKTOR'S VOICE

(from the machine)

-- "... You think he's right for

"Eternity Forever"?... not the

right type?... a different

direction..."

MILTON

(to Max, a shake of the

head)

I'm getting nothing from her side

of the conversation.

MAX

Is it a jamming device?

MILTON

(shrugs)

Maybe he's talking to himself.

MAX

(dismissing the idea)

Taransky isn't that good an actor.

No, they're taking special

precautions.  Some kind of new

encryption.

MILTON

Why?

MAX

(musing)

Whatever it is, it's dark.

MILTON

Dark?

MAX

Yes, very.

VIKTOR'S VOICE

"... We'll talk about it at the

beach house this weekend..."

VIKTOR

(glancing to the computer)

Can't you stop that?

LAINEY

Why?

VIKTOR

Those things can be dangerous.

Staring at a screen all day -- you

miss what's going on outside in the

real world.  You can lose yourself.

You should get out more.  How are

you going to meet boys?

LAINEY

(shrugs coyly, getting up)

I know plenty of boys.

VIKTOR

Really?  Who?  Where do you meet

them?  In a chat room?  How do you

know he's not some middle-aged

freak?

LAINEY

Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak

a mile away.

VIKTOR

Okay.  But you have to find a way

to escape that thing.

LAINEY

I do.

VIKTOR

How?

LAINEY

I read.

VIKTOR

You do?  Still?  I can't tell you

how happy I am to hear that.

LAINEY

You were the one who insisted on

it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and

Joyce when I was four.

VIKTOR

You understood them.  That's what

was amazing.

(looking out the window)

It's a nice day.  Let's eat

outside.

LAINEY

Actually, it may be nicer inside.

VIKTOR

Stay here, I'll deal with this.

PHOTOGRAPHER 1

That wasn't her, Taransky.

ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER

Where is she?  You can't hide her

forever.

VIKTOR

(hurling the camera into

the mob)

You'll never find her.  Simone only

appears when I want her to appear.

MAX

She sounds like a prisoner,

Taransky.  Are you holding her

hostage?  Are you some kind of

Svengali?

VIKTOR

(recognizing the reporter)

Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or

you?  You look kind of "captive"

yourself.  While you're spending

every waking hour obsessing over

Simone, guess what, I guarantee she

doesn't even know you exist.  Get

off my property or I'll call the

cops.

MAX

The cops?  The cops read my column

to know who to bust.  We're the

only watchdog the public has.

(looking around at the

photographers)

None of this is going away.  We'll

be here tomorrow and the day after

that.  Until you slip up.  And you

will.  You are looking at your

shadow.

(getting in his face)

Because all these elaborate

precautions with Simone -- every

instinct in my body tells me, it's

not natural.

VIKTOR

I'm just trying to help you, Sayer.

I don't want you to be

disappointed.  It gets cold out

here at night.

MAX

Nice try.  If we can't get to her

through you, maybe your family will

be more co-operative.  I can

guarantee you, Taransky, one way or

another, Miss Simone and I are

going to get acquainted.

VIKTOR

(turning away)

I'd like to see that, Sayer.

Invite me.

REPORTER (ON RADIO)

-- The rumor is, Simone is holed up

in Taransky's Malibu home -- so far

we haven't seen so much as a

glimpse --

VIKTOR

(switching off the radio)

Honey, I'm really sorry about all

this.  I don't know if it's safe

for you to stay the weekends...

just until things settle down.

LAINEY

(shrugs)

Okay, Dad.

VIKTOR

If anyone asks about Simone --

LAINEY

-- I know, I don't know anything.

VIKTOR

Exactly.

(slightly irritated by her

lack of interest)

Don't you wonder where I'm really

hiding Simone?

LAINEY

(looking to him)

I'm sure you'd tell me if you

thought it was important.

VIKTOR

(from the car)

Sorry I didn't get her back in

time.

ELAINE

No problem.

(she smiles)

Do you want to come in?

VIKTOR

(surprised -- pleasantly)

Why not?

KENT

Hey, Vik.

VIKTOR

(disappointed to see him)

Hello -- Kent.

ELAINE

Viktor, we simply have to talk

about "Eternity..."

VIKTOR

"Forever".

ELAINE

Whatever.  I still haven't received

Simone's script notes.

VIKTOR

There aren't any.  If the

filmmakers are happy, Simone's

happy.  She considers herself an...

"instrument".

ELAINE

Really?  Oh, so she's really going

to do all this nudity?

VIKTOR

(shrugs)

If it's on the page...

ELAINE

Well, something has to be done

about this budget.  It's completely

unrealistic.

(referring to a column in

the budget)

You allowed nothing for limousine

service.

VIKTOR

She'll drive herself.

ELAINE

Hair and make-up?

VIKTOR

She'll do her own.  Theater

training.

ELAINE

She was in the theater?  When?

Where?

VIKTOR

I'll send you her resume.

ELAINE

Al least a contingency for

wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a

dress size.

VIKTOR

-- I guarantee she won't gain an

once.  She's very disciplined.

ELAINE

(concerned by an entry in

the budget)

Well, we have to do something about

this -- "stuntwoman".

VIKTOR

What about it?

ELAINE

There isn't one.

VIKTOR

No need.  She does all her own

stunts.

ELAINE

(skeptical)

Even the fall from the plane?

VIKTOR

(nonchalant)

Even the fall from the plane.

ELAINE

Well, shoot it on the last day.

VIKTOR

As I've tried to explain to you,

Elaine.  Simone isn't like any

other actress you've ever known.

She's about the work and only the

work -- lives for the work.  She

wants all the money up there...

(gazing into space)

... on the screen where it belongs.

She'd work for scale except I know

you only respect people you pay a

fortune.

ELAINE

Which accounts for your percentage.

(tossing the budget on the

coffee table)

When do I get to meet this dream?

VIKTOR

Not today.  She's learning her

lines.

(glancing to Elaine's

budget)

You can also take cue cards and

teleprompter out of the budget.

ELAINE

(smiles)

I'll walk you out.

ELAINE

Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to

you now, not as Elaine, studio

head, but Elaine, ex-wife.

(correcting herself)

Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this

last time but you need to be

careful.  We both know you wouldn't

be making this overblown art film

of you hadn't convinced Simone to

be in it.

VIKTOR

Elaine, talking to you now, not as

Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex

husband... what the hell happened

to you?

ELAINE

(exasperated)

Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this

a hundred times -- young stars

destroying the very people who

discovered them.  I'm worried about

you, that's all.  This woman -- she

controls your destiny.

VIKTOR

Simone does not control my destiny.

ELAINE

Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of

my feelings.  There's something

about her I don't trust.

JANE

(sheepish)

Thanks for taking me back, Mr.

Taransky.  I know it looked like I

sided with the studio, but I always

believed in you, honestly.

VIKTOR

Don't worry.  I understand.

JANE

(referring to the cast

seated around a

conference table)

They're all here.

VIKTOR

I can't tell you how delighted I am

to have this wonderful cast

assembled for "Eternity Forever".

Thank you all.  Now, a reminder --

as a condition for working on this

film, you will not be rehearsing

with Simone, shooting with Simone

and you are forbidden from

contacting Simone in any way at any

time, whatsoever.

HAL

(a thought occurs)

How will you do our love scenes?

VIKTOR

Body double.

HAL

(confused)

For her?

VIKTOR

For you.

(addressing the entire

cast)

I want you to know, Simone

appreciates you all working for

scale.  But why am I thanking you?

Simone can thank you herself.  She

insisted on speaking with you

before filming begins.  She's on

the line now.

VIKTOR

(pushing a button on the

phone)

Simone, are you there?

SIMONE

(through the speakerphone)

I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.

LOTUS

(unable to contain her

excitement)

So are we, Simone!

SIMONE (O.S.)

Why don't you leave me alone with

my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we

can get to know each other better?

HAL

Good idea.

VIKTOR

Of course.  I'll be back in a

minute.

SIMONE (O.S.)

Hi.  Who's there?  Don't be shy.

Introduce yourselves.

MAC

I'm Mac.  I turned down a

Bertolucci film to be here.

LOTUS

My name's Lotus.  God, I can't

believe I'm talking to you.  We're

going to become such great friends.

HAL

I'm Hal.  Wonderful to be working

together... again.

SIMONE

Is that everyone...?

(pause)

Well, obviously, as you know...

SIMONE / VIKTOR

... I'm Simone.

HAL

(from Viktor's

speakerphone)

Obviously.  Who else?

SIMONE / VIKTOR

(from speaker phone)

I just want to start by apologizing

for my "process" --

MAC

-- No.  No.  I'm completely

simpatico.  On my last film I was

playing a schizophrenic so I made

them give me two dressing rooms.

HAL

(an aside)

So committed.

SIMONE (O.S.)

Well thank you for your

understanding.  I know it's an

unusual way to work but I just find

I relate better to people when

they're not actually there.

LOTUS

Of course, of course.

SIMONE (O.S.)

I don't have much to say except

that I know it's going to be a

great project, if we all just trust

Mr. Taransky's vision.  Always do

what Mr. Taransky says.  If in

doubt, do it the Taransky way.

SIMONE (O.S.)

I know we're going to make a

wonderful movie together.

LOTUS

(nodding in agreement)

Wonderful movie.

HAL

Together, absolutely.

VIVIAN

Mr. Taransky...

VIKTOR

(referring to the stage)

No one goes in there.

VIVIAN

Oh, I know.

VIVIAN

If it's not too much trouble.

Could you...?

VIKTOR

Of course...

VIVIAN

(hesitant about broaching

the subject)

This last year I was... going

through some things.

(shaking her head at the

memory)

Awful, awful... things.  But when I

saw Simone in "Sunrise"... what she

did... in the scene in the

fireworks factory...

(face lighting up)

... suddenly everything made sense.

My friends, family, doctors --

nobody could reach me -- but

Simone, she really... spoke to me.

VIKTOR

She'll be happy to sign it.

VIKTOR (O.S.)

Cut!  Cut!... Cut!

VIKTOR

Hal, what are you doing?

HAL

Viktor, Clyde simply has to get

close to Simone in this scene!  He

has to touch her.  He has to!

VIKTOR

Absolutely not!

HAL

But she's right there!  I must feel

her!

VIKTOR

You can't.

HAL

Why not?

VIKTOR

(struggling to find an

excuse)

There's... a wall between you --

HAL

-- an emotional wall, I know.

That's why --

VIKTOR

-- No.  No.  A real wall.

(describing a wall with

his hands within the

green space)

You ran right through it.

HAL

(confused)

How did the wall get there?

VIKTOR

I can't explain it to you now --

you'll see when it's all put

together.

(walking away)

Anyway, we got it a couple of takes

ago.  Let's move on.

SIMONE

(eyes welling with tears)

-- What you don't understand,

Clyde, is that love is like a wild

flower, but that flower only

grows --

JOY                  SADNESS              FEAR

elated               melancholy           anxious

jubilant             tearful              frightened

giddy                weeping              petrified

skull

VIKTOR

Let's take it down a notch.

SIMONE

-- What you don't understand --

VIKTOR

I like it.  But still too big.

(making a correction)

Smaller teardrops next time.

VIKTOR

It's not working.  It's not alive.

Let's try it again.

SIMONE

(teardrops arriving on

cue)

-- What you don't understand,

Clyde, is that love is like a wild

flower, but that flower only grows

on the edge...

(dramatic pause)

... of a very high cliff.

VIKTOR

Perfect, Simone.

VIKTOR

I'm only sorry you still have to

work with flesh and blood for the

time being -- as user friendly as

you are, even I can't manufacture

an entire cast.

VIKTOR

We are going to have to change our

plans, Simone -- you have no idea

what an affect your performance is

having on people.  We can't stop

now.  There's too much to say --

these films they speak, they speak

to the human condition.  We're

changing lives.  No, revealing the

truth now would be too cruel.

(searching for more

justification)

Anyway, when you're seeking a

greater truth -- in the work -- you

are not so concerned with the

lesser truths along the way.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

You're going to get in a lot of

trouble, Mr. Taransky.

VIKTOR

(irritated at her pricking

his conscience)

Why do you have to bring that up?

There's always risk -- life's a

risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how

could something so lovely be a

crime?

(regarding her tenderly)

Well, I think we've done enough for

today.  You've been cooped up in

there too long.  How about you and

me go out on the town?  They're

expecting us.

VIKTOR

I'm checking in a special guest...

(obviously conspiratorial)

... Miss Enomis.

CONCIERGE

Miss Enomis, yes.

VIKTOR

Miss Enomis demands her privacy.

You will switch off all

surveillance cameras.  I will

escort Miss Enomis to her room

alone via the rear exit.  She will

require no help with her luggage.

She does not wish to be disturbed

at any time for any reason.  She

will be departing for a function

tonight at eight sharp.

hundred dollar bill)

I'm sure I can rely on your

discretion.  Do you understand?

Oh, I understand.

Okay, I think everyone's here.

in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.

He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same

sheets recently vacated by Viktor.

VIKTOR

(not quite able to avert

his eyes from her

telescopic legs)

Thank God for you, Faith.  I know

this is above and beyond the call

of duty for a stand-in.  You don't

know what a service you're

performing for Simone -- shielding

her from those animals.

FAITH

No, thank God for you, Mr.

Taransky.  How many men would go

to so much trouble to protect a

woman?

VIKTOR

You understand you'll have to come

back to my place to keep them off

the, er...

(his nose close to Faith's

neck)

... scent.

FAITH

Of course.

VIKTOR

(meeting her gaze)

You look so, so...

FAITH

... so much like her?

VIKTOR

Yes, of course, but very beautiful

in your own right.

FAITH

I do find myself physically

attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.

VIKTOR

Viktor.

FAITH

Do whatever you do to Simone.

VIKTOR

What?... What did you say?

FAITH

Do what you do to Simone.

VIKTOR

What I do to Simone?

FAITH

Yes, call me Simone.

VIKTOR

Simone?

FAITH

(still tearing at his

clothes)

Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what

you do to Simone.  I want to know

what it's like to be her just for

one night.

VIKTOR

(confused)

You're with me to be close to her?

FAITH

(panting)

Is that a problem?

FAITH

"Why are we here?  Is that what

you're asking, Jack?... Why are we

here?  No why.  Just here".

VIKTOR

(this is too much for

Viktor)

Please put your clothes on

ELAINE

Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood

Foreign Press is going to eat this

up.

VIKTOR

Thank you.

(turning to his daughter)

What did you think, Lainey?

LAINEY

One thing bothered me.

VIKTOR

I know, Hal is as stiff as always.

LAINEY

No, not that.  I was just wondering

-- in the bedroom scene in reel two

why did Simone have no reflection

when she walked in front of that

mirror?

VIKTOR

(ashen-faced)

I wondered if you'd spot that.

You've got a good eye, Lainey.  I'm

proud of you.

VIKTOR

I got them to remove the

reflection.  The mirror's metaphor

-- to show how her character's

inwardly dead.

ELAINE

That's genius, Viktor.  Was that

Simone's idea?

VIKTOR

(sarcastic, annoyed at the

suggestion)

Who else?  It's always Simone's

idea.

LAINEY

(not quite convinced)

So that accounts for the lack of a

shadow in reel six?

VIKTOR

Precisely.

LAINEY

(as she gets into the car)

Good-night, Daddy.

VIKTOR

(kissing Lainey good-bye)

Night, Lainey.

VIKTOR

(drawing Elaine aside)

Elaine, I don't know if it's a good

idea for Lainey to come to the

screenings -- mature content and

all that.

ELAINE

(impressed by his

responsible attitude)

Maybe you're right.

(gently teasing)

Twelve years after your daughter's

born you decide to become a father.

VIKTOR

Better late than never.

ELAINE

(softening)

I should fire you more often.  The

film's looking wonderful.

VIKTOR

You really think so?

ELAINE

Yes.  To be honest I never quite

saw this film before -- maybe it's

the way Simone is playing it -- but

what it's saying about the illusion

of permanence in everyday life, how

that's the only way we can love --

I think it's really going to mean

something.

VIKTOR

Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you

liked it.

ELAINE

I'd love to tell her myself.

(cajoling)

When are you going to let me meet

her?

VIKTOR

Soon.  Soon.

ELAINE

Everyone I know has met her,

Viktor.

VIKTOR

Everyone you know is lying.

ELAINE

(amused)

That's true.

VIKTOR

Damnit!

ELAINE

You know how you can stop that.

She has to get out more.

(climbing into the car)

See you at the premiere.

PREMIERE REPORTER 1

(talking to camera)

-- What a night!  Anyone who's

anyone is here at the premiere of

"Eternity Forever," but waiting for

Simone to show may take even

longer.  We do have her director,

Viktor Taransky.

(ushering him over)

Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?

VIKTOR

(slightly irritated by the

focus on the star)

You know Simone.

PREMIERE REPORTER 2

I hope she does show up.  Some of

her fans got here at dawn.  We

don't want to disappoint them.

VIKTOR

(through a pained smile)

Well, I'm sure they're going to

love the movie.  I got the

inspiration --

PREMIERE REPORTER 2

HARRY EPSON!

PREMIERE REPORTER 2

Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a

minute?  What brings you here

tonight?

HARRY

(waving to the fans)

I just came out to support my good

friend, Simone.

PREMIERE REPORTER 2

There's a rumor that you're more

than just "good friends"?

HARRY

(slightly irritated by the

invasion)

We've been seeing each other, sure,

but we'd rather keep our

relationship private.

PREMIERE REPORTER 2

(believing she has a

scoop)

Do I hear the sound of... wedding

bells?

HARRY

(suddenly losing it)

I can't believe you people!  No

wonder she never comes to these

things!

MOVER/SHAKER

Elaine!  The picture is a

revelation!

ELAINE

Thank you.  I mean, it was a team

effort --

HAL

Is she here?

VIKTOR

I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?

HAL

(oblivious to his sarcasm)

Somebody said she was here.

MAC

Oh my God, that's her glass!

(impulsively smelling

"Simone's" glass)

Jack Daniels, straight-up.  She is

my kind of woman.

HAL

(looking anxiously around

the room)

Viktor, where is she?

VIKTOR

She's around.

MAC

(dawning on him, glancing

to the far side of the

packed room)

Jesus, Hal... she's in the Ladies

Room.

HAL

You know I sometimes forget she has

bodily functions.

VIKTOR

(unable to resist)

I know what you mean.

HAL

(anxiously looking to the

restroom)

I have to talk to her about my

experimental film.  It's very...

experimental.

MAC

Is that her? -- By the fountain.

VIKTOR

(testy)

No.  In fact, between us, she

doesn't really exist.

HAL

(ignoring him, calling out

to the woman)

Simone!

MAC

SIMONE!

GUEST 1

-- Simone's here!

ELAINE

(slightly the worse for

drink)

-- When did she arrive?  Why didn't

someone tell me?

GUEST 2

-- Where is she?

MAC

-- She's by the fountain.

GUEST 3

-- Simone, over here!

GUEST 4

-- Simone!

LOOKALIKE WOMAN

Simone!

ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER

(into microphone)

-- Forget "Eternity Forever", the

big news tonight was the surprise

appearance of Simone.  Even these

seen-it-all superstars are

apparently not immune to Simone

fever and the resulting stampede

forced organizers to bring the

event to an early end.  I spoke

with some of the departing guests

about their encounter with

Hollywood's most reluctant

superstar.

EXECUTIVE 3

-- I would say, even more beautiful

in person, you have to see her to

believe her.

MALE GUEST 1

-- I can't reveal what we spoke

about.  It was... personal.  Simone

and I go back a long way.

FEMALE GUEST 1

-- When she talks to you, for that

moment, you are the only other

human being in the room.

FEMALE GUEST 2

(dress torn)

-- I really don't know what the

fuss is about.  So over-rated.

She's done one film.  Talk to me

when she's had the kind of career

I've had.

MALE GUEST 2

-- I do expect her to be nominated,

yes.

ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER

Fortunately, Simone was not amongst

the injured and was spirited away

as mysteriously as she arrived.

MAX

-- She goes to a major, Hollywood,

A-list party and we don't get an

interview, a comment, we don't even

get a photograph?  Is that what

you're telling me?

ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER

Nobody got a photograph.  Nobody

ever gets a photograph.

MILTON

We've got our best people on it,

Mr. Sayer.

MAX

24-hour tail on Taransky?

MILTON

Shutter bugs camped outside any

place he goes, every concierge and

maitre d' on the take.  But this

Simone woman is good.

MAX

(referring to a

"Confidential" FBI

report)

Obviously the name isn't real --

she's using an assumed identity,

travels under a false name, checks

into hotels with an alias.  She

never stays in the same place two

nights in a row.  Anything on the

satellite photos?

(irritated)

What about the fingerprints?  What

happened when we dusted that hotel

suite?

MILTON

Well, we got some of Taransky's

fingerprints, a lot of your

fingerprints... but none of hers.

MAX

(interest piqued)

Which means they're significant.

(beat)

Incriminating.

(beat)

Perhaps, criminal.

(getting excited)

She's hiding her past.  She's

hiding her past.

MAX

Of course -- no one's that perfect,

that pure.  You know I had

something on Mother Teresa.  But

then she died and it wasn't worth

it anymore.

(approaching a computer)

I know how to flush out this Simone

-- a tell-all story from her

childhood.

MILTON

(impressed)

My God, you've got one?

MAX

(offering Milton a seat in

front of the computer)

I will when you're finished writing

it.

MAX

(disappointed in his

protege)

Am I wasting my time with you?

When she sues to protect her

privacy, she'll have to appear in a

public courtroom to do it.

MILTON

(under his breath)

Long live the First Amendment.

MAX

Sometimes you have to tell a small

lie to get to the bigger truth.

(to his nervous

photographer)

As for a photo -- if you can't do

it, I know twelve million people

who can.

VIKTOR

-- You can't go in there!

ELAINE

-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!

EXECUTIVE 1

-- We know she's in there!

VIKTOR

(struggling to hold them

back)

-- Why?  What's all this about?

EXECUTIVE 2

(waving a spreadsheet)

-- We've got the tracking numbers

for "Eternity Forever".

EXECUTIVE 3

-- They're in the toilet.

ELAINE

-- She has to get out there and

sell the film.

VIKTOR

-- What do you want her to do, go

door-to-door -- ?

EXECUTIVE 1

-- Even Garbo would be on the talk

show circuit if she was alive

today.

VIKTOR

(irritated)

-- It's precisely because she

doesn't crave the limelight that

people love her.  I told you, she's

only about the work.

EXECUTIVE 3

-- This is over-shadowing the work!

EXECUTIVE 2

(waving the front page of

The Echo)

That's the problem.  She's more

famous for her no-shows than her

shows.

ELAINE

-- It's starting to look like she

doesn't support the film or you,

Viktor.

(trying to squeeze past

Viktor)

If you can't handle her, I will.

VIKTOR

(blocking her path)

Not now.  She's emotional.  Her

mother dies today.  Scene forty-two

of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a

good time.

VIKTOR

No!  Please, don't go in there!

EXECUTIVE 1

Where is she?

EXECUTIVE 2

She's not here.

VIKTOR

Elaine... I...

ELAINE

So, the secret's finally out,

Viktor.

VIKTOR

-- I can explain.

ELAINE

-- I don't think that's necessary.

I think it's perfectly clear.  I

should have guessed -- it all makes

sense now... it's why she never

goes anywhere, never seen in

public...

ELAINE

She's into computers.

EXECUTIVE 1

(nodding in agreement)

Probably spends her whole life in

chat rooms.

EXECUTIVE 2

It's the one place she can be

herself.

EXECUTIVE 3

Anonymous.

VIKTOR

(adopting a serious tone)

It's worse than you think.  She's

extremely agoraphobic -- has a

morbid fear of people and germs.

In a way I'm relieved you... found

out.

VIKTOR

The premiere was the first time

I've convinced her to venture out

and it just confirmed her worst

nightmares.

ELAINE

(concerned)

Viktor, you should have said

something.

VIKTOR

She doesn't want pity.

ELAINE

(seeing a new side of

Viktor)

You're so good to protect her like

this.

VIKTOR

(to the Executives,

conceding)

I'll tell you what.  I know how

much this means to you.  I'll try

to get her to plug the film.

(beat)

I'm not promising anything but

maybe she'll do a talk show --

taped.

ELAINE

Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.

VIKTOR

I'll try.  Maybe live but remote.

She'll never go to them.

EXECUTIVE 1

We understand.  Thank you, Viktor.

EXECUTIVE 2

Give her our best.

EXECUTIVE 1

(aside to a colleague)

That agoraphobia -- it's like a

plague.

EXECUTIVE 2

It's out of control in Europe.

VIKTOR

I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to

introduce you to Simone at the

premiere.  There wasn't time with

the riot and everything.

(picking up a framed photo

from the work station)

But she wanted you to have this.

ELAINE

She was there.  She didn't by any

chance happen to mention me?

VIKTOR

She said you were very beautiful.

ELAINE

(flattered)

Really?

VIKTOR

(blurting out)

Elaine, what are you doing tonight?

Would you like to go somewhere --

dinner?

ELAINE

I'd love to.  But aren't you

supposed to meet up with Simone?

VIKTOR

Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I

always?

MAX

She likes Apple Jacks... just like

me...

MILTON

Mr. Sayer...

MAX

(irritated at being

interrupted)

What do you want -- ?

MILTON

Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million

bucks yet?

MAX

(never averting his eyes

from the screen)

-- Cashier's check went out to our

anonymous tipster this morning --

worth every penny too.  Who says

there's no place for checkbook

journalism?  We'll be running

stills of this for months, then

release the whole tape -- we'll get

our money back -- maybe show it on

an exclusive pay-per-view event.

Do you realize what we have here?

We have the only independent

footage of Simone in existence.

MILTON

We used to.

MILTON

(holding a copy of the

L.A. Times Calendar

section - "Simone Live")

She's doing Frank Brand on

Thursday.

MAX

Get out.

FRANK BRAND

(to camera)

Tonight on Frank Brand Live --

FRANK BRAND

-- Since taking the nation by storm

with her debut movie, "Sunrise,

Sunset"...

FRANK BRAND

... no one's managed to land a live

TV interview with the fabulous, new

shooting starlet, Simone... until

now.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

Make up your mind, Viktor.  Make up

your mind.

FRANK BRAND

I'm happy to say she's agreed to

join us tonight from the set of her

new film.

(turning to the TV

monitor)

Welcome, Simone.

SIMONE

Wonderful to be with you, Frank.

KENT

She is all woman.

FRANK BRAND

Well, no one could accuse you of

being over-exposed, Simone.  Why

have you stayed so completely out

of the limelight?

SIMONE

(shrugs)

I just think actors talk too much.

Does the world really want to hear

your life story just because you've

got a movie opening Friday?

FRANK BRAND

Of course, the only problem with

shying away from publicity these

days is that it tends to attract

more.

SIMONE

(from TV)

Don't I know it.  That's the only

reason I'm here now -- to put the

attention back where it belongs, on

Mr. Taransky's film.

FRANK BRAND

You don't secretly want the

attention?

SIMONE

I'm not even sure I deserve it.

After tonight I'll have almost as

much screen time on your show as I

do in my movies.  How is that

healthy for a performer?

SIMONE

(from TV)

Because, you have to understand,

Frank, these interviews -- none of

this is real.  Who I am on screen

and who I really am are two totally

different people.

FRANK BRAND

Who are you really?

SIMONE

That's a good question.

(beat)

As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man

strives long and hard to appear

someone else..."

LAINEY

(reading from a bookmarked

page, along with Simone)

"... he ends up finding it is

difficult to be himself again."

FRANK BRAND

Well put.

MAX

(focusing on the desert

background behind Simone)

I know where that is... I know...

FRANK BRAND

Change of topic.  Simone, you've

been romantically linked to dozens

of men in the press -- Mick Jagger,

Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro...

and most recently Viktor Taransky.

Is there a Mr. Right in there

somewhere?

SIMONE

I'd rather not discuss my private

life.

(gently)

But Viktor and I are inseparable.

KENT

You dog, Viktor!

SIMONE

(from TV)

I literally wouldn't be here today

without him.

FRANK BRAND

Would you like a moment, Simone?

SIMONE

No, I'm okay.

FRANK BRAND

Let's talk about the work that you

care so much about.

SIMONE

Sure.  Where would you like to

start?

FRANK BRAND

How about the nudity?

SIMONE

Nudity has just never been an issue

for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are

just an option.

FRANK BRAND

What exactly was it that attracted

you to your first two projects?

SIMONE

(unable to resist a smile)

I suppose the thing I like most

about the movies I'm in is that

they're not about special effects.

FRANK BRAND

They're better for it if I may say.

!!INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK!!

FRANK BRAND

(regarding the screen)

Well, we appear to be experiencing

satellite difficulties.  In case we

lose you, Simone, I want to thank

you --

SIMONE / VIKTOR

Thank... YOU, FRANK.

VIKTOR / SIMONE

Hel--

VIKTOR

(into phone)

Hello.

ELAINE

-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is

she there?

VIKTOR

No.

ELAINE

Are you and Simone...

(blurting it out)

... getting married?

VIKTOR

(taken aback by the

suggestion)

No, of course not!

(realizing the

significance of the

question)

Why?  Would you care if we were?

ELAINE

(covering, realizing she

has given herself away)

Well, yes.  From a studio point of

view, it would be better if Simone

stayed single.

(quick change of topic)

Anyhow, I thought she came across

great tonight.  Intelligent, well

informed, a natural.  And touching.

She was spectacular.

VIKTOR

Thank you.

ELAINE

Viktor, do you realize you always

do that?

VIKTOR

Do what?

ELAINE

Whenever I compliment Simone, you

take the credit.

VIKTOR

I do?

ELAINE

Yes, you do...

(shrug)

Anyway, tonight was a good start.

VIKTOR

Excuse me?  Start?

ELAINE

It's a crowded summer.  We need

every photo-opp, sound-byte and

column inch we can get.  Good

night, Viktor.

LAINEY

(carefully broaching the

subject)

Mom, do you miss Dad?

ELAINE

(she thinks)

Sometimes.  But, just when I think

your father's changing for the

better, I realize he's as self

absorbed as ever.  He took the

credit for Simone tonight.

LAINEY

I think Dad deserves more credit

than he gets.

VIKTOR

(to Simone)

Will you cover yourself up!?

MAX

-- I've been here before! -- On my

honeymoon with my ex-wife.

MILTON

Is that why she left you?

MAX

(pointing out a Joshua

tree)

You see, that's the exact same tree

and in the distance, there's the...

(voice trailing away)

... mountain.

MILTON

It's a hotel.

MAX

I don't understand.

MILTON

Could they have built that hotel

since yesterday?

MAX

Get in the car.

VIKTOR

(angrily into phone)

-- We don't do the photo shoot, you

don't get the cover... written

answers to written questions,

that's right... website interviews,

no problem.

VIKTOR

(muttering to himself)

You want exposure, Elaine?  I'll

give you over-exposure...

SIMONE

I think "Eternity Forever" is my

finest work.

SIMONE

I'm most proud of my work in

"Eternity Forever".

SIMONE

I think people are going to love

"Eternity Forever".

VIKTOR

Forgive me, Simone.

"ETERNITY FOREVER" HAS BIG FUTURE AT B.O.!

$$$IMONE - WINS 6TH WEEKEND IN A ROW

SIMONE

Of course, being a movie star is

wonderful, but I have so many other

ways I want to express myself --

"SIMONE'S FAVORITE SOUTHERN RECIPES"

"HUMAN:KIND - The POETRY of SIMONE"

"SIMONE'S 101 WAYS TO JOY"

SEARCH: "NUMBER 1 HITS - FEMALE ARTISTS/BILLBOARD CHARTS"

PERIOD: "LAST 40 YEARS"

MAX

Nice boat, Taransky.

VIKTOR

It's a yacht.

MAX

I know what you're up to.

VIKTOR

(pushing past Max)

I don't have time for this, Sayer.

MAX

I think you do.

(holding up his video

print of Simone in the

desert)

I know it's a fake.

MAX

Got your attention now?

MAX

(referring to the

photographs)

It's bogus.  You used an old

library shot for the background.

VIKTOR

(ashen)

The background is.

MAX

She was never in New Mexico.  She

never left the studio.

MAX

(referring to a large

bundle of other shots

under his arm)

I've done my homework.  I've

studied her.

VIKTOR

-- I bet you have.

MAX

-- I've looked at every piece of

publicity she's ever done, the

video in the supermarket, there's

no evidence she's ever left the

studio.

(afterthought)

Oh, and for some reason this woman

leaves no paper trail.  But I have

"obtained" a copy of your bank

accounts.  I know you have power of

attorney but so far you haven't

transferred one single solitary

cent to her.

VIKTOR

I'm keeping it in trust.

MAX

I know that's what you'd like us to

believe.  But I got to tell you --

embezzlement is a serious matter.

Not to mention abduction.

VIKTOR

Abduction?

MAX

I don't buy the whole recluse scam.

How are you doing it?  What is it --

drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control?

All three?  What do you do -- keep

her locked in a box somewhere?

VIKTOR

What is it exactly you want, Sayer?

MAX

I want to see her.  Unless you show

me Simone live and in person I show

these pictures to the authorities.

VIKTOR

Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.

MAX

Er,... good.

MILTON

That's good.

PROMOTER

All ready, Mr. Taransky.  This time

tomorrow night, she'll be standing

right here in front of a packed

house.  We could have sold it out

twenty times.

TECHNICIAN

Soundcheck went perfect.  Laser

show ready to go.

(cautionary note)

I gotta say, you ordered an awful

lot of smoke.

VIKTOR

That's the way she likes it.

PROMOTER

After what you told us about the

death threats, the security guards

are under strict instructions never

to take their eyes off the crowd.

VIKTOR

Excellent.

VIKTOR

Simone wanted you to have these.

TECHNICIAN

(visibly moved by the

gesture)

Wish her luck from us.

VIKTOR

Oh, I will.

(afterthought)

Remember, no cameras, no

binoculars.

CROWD

... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...

CROWD

... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...

VIKTOR

Let's get you into hair and make

up.

VIKTOR

Wardrobe.

VIKTOR

Easier to make one hundred thousand

believe than just one.

ANNOUNCER

Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor

Taransky Promotions is proud to

present, live on stage, for the

debut concert of the "Splendid

Isolation" tour, the one, the only,

SI-MONE!

SIMONE

(from on stage)

I love you...

SIMONE

... L.A.

SIMONE

It's great to be here.

SIMONE.

passengers gyrate to SIMONE webcast.

VIKTOR

(to the image of Simone on

his screen)

I don't know about you, Simone, but

I've never felt more alive.

VIKTOR

Damn!

SIMONE

Good-night.  Never stop believing.

FAN 1

-- I swear, she looked right at me.

FAN 2

-- She was, like, ethereal.

FAN 3

-- One moment she seemed to walk

right through her mike stand like

it wasn't even there.

VIKTOR

I said I didn't want to be

interrupt --

VIKTOR

(face brightening)

My two favorite girls.

ELAINE

Lainey and I just wanted to

congratulate...

ELAINE

... Simone.

VIKTOR

She's lying down.  She's exhausted.

ELAINE

(suddenly cool)

I can imagine.

ELAINE

Thank Simone for the tickets.

LAINEY

(calling back as she is

led away)

It was a great show, Dad...

VIKTOR

Where are you... going?

ELAINE

I can't believe she's doing this --

taking advantage of him this way.

It's cruel.

KENT

Why?

ELAINE

Obviously, this can't last.  She's

going to dump him.  Viktor won't be

able to take that.  He's too

sensitive.  It'll destroy him.

KENT

Elaine, do you realize you can't

stop talking about Viktor?

ELAINE

(not hearing)

I have to talk to her.

KENT

I've been meaning to talk to you.

VIKTOR

Hey, Lainey.

(gently teasing her)

How's your love life?

LAINEY

I do okay.  How about you?

VIKTOR

You know me -- married to my work.

LAINEY

I noticed.

LAINEY

Dad, you know I don't like to get

between you and mom but she's

feeling down right now.  She broke

up with Kent.

VIKTOR

(buoyed by the news)

Really?  Too bad.

LAINEY

She thinks you're with Simone.

VIKTOR

Lainey, you know Simone and I don't

have a real relationship.

LAINEY

I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if

it came from Simone, if Simone

spoke to Mom -- she could

straighten things out.

(shrug)

Dinner, maybe.

VIKTOR

Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A

phone call?

LAINEY

Too impersonal.  They have to meet

face-to-face.

VIKTOR

I'll see what I can do.

(a thought occurs)

You know, Lainey.  I don't believe

you've ever once asked to meet

Simone.  Don't you like her?

LAINEY

I love her but that doesn't mean I

need to meet her.

LAINEY

Why?  So I can tell my friends at

school -- as if that validates my

life somehow.  What's Simone going

to say to a fourteen-year-old

anyhow?  She's going to be polite

because you're my father but we're

not suddenly going to become

friends -- we have nothing in

common.  It's not going to be real.

Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in

my head every day.  Why kill the

dream?  What do they say, "don't

get too close to your idols, they

always disappoint you".

VIKTOR

I love you, Lainey.

LAINEY

I love you too, daddy.

LAINEY

That's Mom.

(kissing him on the

forehead)

See you.

ELAINE

Hello?

SIMONE

Hello, is this Elaine?

ELAINE

Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you,

Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk

to you.

SIMONE

Well, here I am.

(beat)

You look pretty today.  Red suits

you.

ELAINE

(looking around the

freeway)

Where are you?

SIMONE

Right beside you.  I borrowed

Viktor's car.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm

late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor

now.

ELAINE

No, I understand.  That's what I

want to talk about.  I don't know

if you know this, Simone, but

Viktor and I were married once.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

I can't imagine how you ever let a

man like that go.  I owe Viktor

everything.

ELAINE

I think he owes more to you.  But

that's not important now.  I know

what's going on between you two.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

I want to reassure you, Elaine,

there's absolutely nothing going on

between Viktor and I.

ELAINE

(rueful smile)

You don't have to protect my

feelings, Simone.  I don't blame

Viktor for falling in love with the

most desirable woman in the world.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

(breaking character)

I'm not --

(correcting himself)

He's not.

ELAINE

My God, are you alright, Simone?

SIMONE / VIKTOR

Damn --

(struggling to stay in

her/his lane)

Yes -- I --

(regaining control)

-- I'm just a little tired.

Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I --

it's strictly a working

relationship.  We could never be

anything else.  We're just so...

different.

ELAINE

Exactly.  You're a household name

now.  You're moving in entirely

different worlds.  That's why I

hope you're not toying with Viktor.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

It sounds like you still have

feelings for him.

ELAINE

We have a daughter together.  I

just don't want to see Viktor get

hurt.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

I don't know how many times I have

to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and

I are not in love.

(joking weakly)

I only make love to the camera.

ELAINE

Simone, I recognize the shirt

you're wearing.  I gave it to

Viktor on his birthday.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

Christ --

(still struggling to stay

on the road)

Elaine, I know how it looks but...

(blurting it out)

... it would mean a lot to Viktor

if you'd go with him to the Oscars.

If you won't do it for him, please

do it for me.

ELAINE

(reluctant, frightened by

Simone's erratic driving)

Okay -- for you.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

(sigh of relief)

Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --

ELAINE

I'm glad we talked.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

Good-bye.

PATROLMAN

You don't have to explain.  I know

what the press is like.  Lunatics.

Out of control.

(referring to the Simone

mannequin)

You do know I'm going to have to

take this?

HAL

And the winner is...

HAL

Actually, there's a tie.

HAL

(milking the moment for

all it's worth)

The winners are... Simone for

"Sunrise, Sunset"...

HAL

(big smile)

... and Simone for "Eternity

Forever".

HAL

Unfortunately, Simone can't be with

us tonight.

(turning to the screen)

But thanks to the miracle of modern

technology she is able to join us

live via satellite from the

location of her new film.

SIMONE

Thank you!  Thank you!  This means

so much to me.  I'm just sorry I

can't be there with you.

(wiping away a tear)

First off I have to acknowledge my

fellow nominees -- I don't even

feel I belong in the best actress

category let alone with these...

wonderful human beings.

(composing herself)

I also have to thank my co-stars,

the studio, of course.  But most of

all, I have to thank the audience

for supporting what I do -- you're

the only reason I'm here.

LAINEY

Why didn't she thank you?

VIKTOR

(confused)

She did... didn't she?

ELAINE

(crestfallen)

No.

SIMONE

... And of course I must thank my

collaborator, Viktor Taransky,

without whom none of this would be

possible.

VIKTOR

(to himself)

It's written right there... Why

didn't I say it?... How could I

forget to say it?

VIKTOR

Damn it!

VIKTOR

What now, Sayer?

MAX

(smug smile, noticing

Viktor noticing the

woman)

Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No

one comes from nowhere, Taransky.

You turn over enough rocks...

MAX

I traced her to a nursing home.  A

young woman fitting Simone's

description dropped her off five

years ago.

VIKTOR

She looks a lot like you.

MAX

(undeterred)

She hasn't uttered a word that

whole time -- until she saw the big

show.

OLD LADY

(pointing to Simone's

picture, catatonic)

My baby... My baby...

MAX

(putting his hand on his

heart)

Who would think that "Saint Simone"

would abandon her own mother?  I've

been looking into the family

history -- heartbreaking.  Most

likely a biography to run over four

issues... who knows, maybe there's

a Pulitzer in there somewhere.

OLD LADY

(pointing to Viktor's face

on the driver's license)

My baby... My baby...

MAX

That doesn't prove a thing -- wait

until I get a court order for a

blood test.

VIKTOR

(sensing an opportunity)

That won't be necessary.

(pretending to be

resigned)

Sooner or later I knew you'd crack

this thing, Max.  You got me.

MAX

I do?

(recovering)

Sure I do.

(taking Viktor aside)

Can we speak off the record?  I'm a

fair man.  I'm willing to sit down

with her and tell her side of the

story.

VIKTOR

I wouldn't want you to compromise

your ethics.

MAX

No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.

VIKTOR

You love her, don't you, Max?

MAX

Don't you?

VIKTOR

(writes a check, hands it

to Max)

This should take care of Mother.

VIKTOR

Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you

like it?

LAINEY

(taking in the car)

It's fantastic -- it's too much.

VIKTOR

It's the car she drove in "Eternity

Forever".

LAINEY

I know.  Thank her for me.

VIKTOR

(disappointed by her

reaction)

It's from both of us.  Of course

you'll have to drive it around the

lot until you get your permit --

LAINEY

-- I can't accept it.  I don't want

a car, Dad.

VIKTOR

(clearly hurt, not

understanding)

Why not?  I can get you something

else.  What do you want?

LAINEY

The old Viktor Taransky.

(finally blurting it out)

I liked you better before -- before

all this.  You were a loser, Dad,

but at least you had integrity.  I

can't stand to see you like this --

clinging to Simone's coattails --

it used to be about the work, and

now it's all about her.  And then

she's not even grateful enough to

thank you.

VIKTOR

No, that was me.

LAINEY

There you go again, blaming

yourself.  Can't you see what she's

done to you -- she's taking

advantage, mocking you.  You

deserve better than Simone.

(hasty exit)

I've got to go, Dad.

VIKTOR

Lainey...

JANE

Ready for your casting session?

JANE

Nicola's here for the role of

Simone's sister.

NICOLA

(slightly uncomfortable by

Viktor's scrutiny)

A lot's happened since we last saw

each other.

VIKTOR

(numb)

Yes.

NICOLA

I never apologized properly for

what happened on "Sunrise".

VIKTOR

Thank you.  It's not important.

NICOLA

After I saw what Simone did with

the role -- you know I fired all my

people, went into rehab, took

acting classes, changed my whole

look.  She really inspired me.

NICOLA

(referring to the script

in her hands)

Would you like me to read?

VIKTOR

Yes, I'd like that.

NICOLA

(her angry words are in

opposition to her amorous

actions)

-- Who do you think you are, Carlos

-- coming in here like this?  With

my husband sleeping in the next

room.  Do you think I won't call

out?  Do you think I will just give

in to you without a fight -- like

the last time and the time before

that?

(she kisses his ear)

I wish you were dead.

(she kisses his lips)

I wish we were both dead.

VIKTOR

(finally able to speak)

You know you're really very good.

I take back what I said.  I mean,

you're really good.

NICOLA

Thank you.

VIKTOR

(forgetting himself)

You could play the lead.

NICOLA

(confused)

But that's Simone's part.

VIKTOR

Yes, of course it is.

(gazing at her face)

You know you have a line here.  Not

a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a

dimple.  I've been thinking of

incorporating something like that

in Simone.

NICOLA

(incredulous)

You'd cosmetically alter Simone to

look like me?

VIKTOR

No, of course not, you're right.

That would be crazy.

NICOLA

Do you want me to do it again?

JANE

(into phone)

-- Oh sure, she comes in all the

time... we've become close.  She

told me --

VIKTOR

Jane --

JANE

Gotta go.

VIKTOR

(picking up a pile of

scripts from the in-tray)

I'm leaving early tonight.  If you

need me I'll be at the beach house

having dinner with a... certain

someone.

JANE

(into phone, under her

breath)

... Elaine Christian please.

ELAINE

Viktor, I'm picking up Lainey.

VIKTOR

Elaine, it's Wednesday.

ELAINE

(feigning absent

mindedness)

Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday.

How embarrassing.  I don't know

what I was thinking.  With all the

excitement lately...

(peering past him)

Am I interrupting something?  Are

you expecting company?

VIKTOR

(ushering her inside)

As a matter-of-fact I am.

ELAINE

When is she coming over?

VIKTOR

(glancing to his watch)

About now.  Would you like a drink?

ELAINE

I suppose I could stay, just until

she arrives.

ELAINE

(trying to make

conversation)

Is Simone back to earth yet?

VIKTOR

Not quite.

ELAINE

I'm sure you'll keep her focussed.

She's lucky to have you, Viktor.

(blurting out)

Is she really having your baby?

VIKTOR

Impossible.

ELAINE

(instantly regretting the

remark)

I just read somewhere --

VIKTOR

I know.  I know.  They'll say

anything.

ELAINE

-- And she was positively glowing

at the awards.

(making to leave)

I should be going, she'll be here

soon --

VIKTOR

-- She already is.  Simone's not

coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight,

not ever.

(holding her)

I want you back, Elaine.

ELAINE

(melting)

I want you back too, Viktor.

ELAINE

This is crazy.  Who am I fooling?

I can't compete with Simone.  What

woman can?

VIKTOR

I would rather have you than

Simone.  Believe me.

ELAINE

That's sweet, Viktor, but I

couldn't let you do that -- make

that kind of sacrifice.

(meeting his gaze)

It's strange.  I've stabbed people

in the back, clawed and slept my

way to where I am -- it goes with

the territory -- but, for some

reason, I can't betray Simone.

There's... I don't know any other

way to say it -- there's a goodness

to her.

VIKTOR

No, there isn't.  There's nothing

to her.

ELAINE

Oh, Viktor.  You say that now --

because we're here, alone, like

this.  But in the morning, you'd go

back to her.  What man wouldn't?

VIKTOR

No, I will end my relationship with

her -- totally.

ELAINE

But you don't understand.  She'll

always be there -- at some party,

on some magazine cover, some song

on the radio, up on some screen.

VIKTOR

(desperate)

No.  She'll never work again --

retire, never make a movie or a

record, or appear ever again.

ELAINE

(confused)

Of course she will.  Her public

will demand it.

VIKTOR

Not if I don't let her.

ELAINE

You?

VIKTOR

I'm going to tell you a secret now,

Elaine.

(mustering all his nerve)

Simone is not a real person.  I

invented her.

ELAINE

(misinterpreting his

remark)

Every actor is an invention,

Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself.

No one's denying that you

discovered Simone.  But it's like

finding a diamond in the desert.

Anyone can trip over it, but it's

not the finder who sparkles.

VIKTOR

(agitated)

-- No, no, I didn't trip over her.

You don't understand --

ELAINE

(ignoring him)

-- You just got lucky that she's

loyal enough to stay with you.

Maybe she's staying out of pity,

who knows?  She certainly doesn't

need you.  Some people even say

you're holding her back.

VIKTOR

(wounded)

Who says that -- ?

(shaking off the insult)

-- Never mind.  You have to listen

to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air,

pixels, molded by me from a

mathematical equation.  I inherited

it from a madman -- I can show

you --

ELAINE

How much wine have you had?

VIKTOR

-- She's a figment of my own

imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky,

have perpetrated the greatest hoax,

the greatest sleight-of-hand,

sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of-

sleight in entertainment history!

And still no one appreciates me,

recognizes what I've done -- even

you.

ELAINE

(rolling her eyes)

You're drunker than I thought.  Are

you doing that again?

VIKTOR

No!  Whatever talent Simone has

comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear,

as God is my judge.  You don't know

what I've been through.  Tens of

thousands of mind-numbing hours in

front of that screen, nights

without end, and look what it's

cost me.

(producing his spectacles)

Why do you think I've been wearing

these?  I may have done irreparable

harm to my eyesight, and why?  To

extract and refine the infinite

nuances of a human being -- a human

soul.

(a final explanation)

Don't you see?  I made Simone!

ELAINE

You made Simone?

(a trace of pity)

Viktor, she made you.

VIKTOR

You bitch!  I'll destroy you!

VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash.  Max finds a

beat up reel of 16mm film.

MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.

VIKTOR, hovering at a supermarket check-out line,

WOMAN 2

She must have been so desperate to

do something like that, so

depraved.

WOMAN 1

I'm still naming my baby after her.

WOMAN 2

You're having a boy.

WOMAN 1

So?

Viktor blanches.  It is not the reaction he'd hoped for.

ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty

farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging

for muddy vegetables.

The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into

spontaneous applause.

Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for

"I AM PIG - Starring Simone".

gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking

HOST

Simone, that's a rather

controversial position.

SIMONE

I just think all elementary schools

should have a firing range -- so

SIMONE

at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a

billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE.  It

reads, "SIMONE: WOMAN OF THE YEAR".

VIKTOR

(to himself)

She's trying to kill me.

HANK ALENO

Remembered Virtually Forever

VIKTOR

(referring to the flowers)

They're plastic, Hank.  I know

that's the way you'd want it.

(glancing to a Simone

billboard outside the

cemetery wall)

She killed you, Hank.  Now she's

killing me.  She's a serial killer.

(ducking out of sight of

the billboard as if

Simone is watching him)

But I don't know how to stop her.

She's taken on a life of her own.

I can't just come clean -- make

some confession.  I've defrauded

millions -- they'd turn on me.  And

I can't put the genie back in the

bottle.  If she stopped working --

dropped out of sight, they'd never

let it rest.  I've tried to kill

her career but they like her even

more.

(more desperate)

What am I going to do, Hank?

VIKTOR

Don't say another word, Hank.  You

are truly a genius.

SIMONE / VIKTOR

What's the matter, Viktor?  You

look so sad.  Don't you love me

anymore?... It's over, isn't it?

VIKTOR

It's the only way, Simone.  If it's

any consolation, you're going to

live on in the public's heart like

all the other tragic figures that

went before their time.  There's no

love like posthumous love.

VIKTOR

I know what you're thinking.  It's

a phoney-baloney world.  The women

are surgically enhanced, the

athletes are on steroids, the

singers are lip-syncing if they're

even singing at all, the news is

entertainment, the politicians are

bought and paid for -- we're living

one big lie.  So why shouldn't you

live too?  You're more authentic

than the people who adore you.

(a trace of despair)

And that's the problem.  You're

looking at the real fraud.  I told

myself this was all about the work

but if that was the truth, it

wouldn't matter to me -- and it

does.  It wasn't that the artists

had no respect for the art.  They

had no respect for me.  Someone

like you, you have so much love

showered on you -- I just wanted to

feel one tiny drop on my face.  I'm

sorry, Simone.  Here I've been

trying to convince the world that

you exist, but I was really trying

to convince them that I exist.

It's not that you aren't human,

Simone, it's that I am.

VIKTOR

It is my sad and solemn duty to

announce the tragic passing of

Simone.

CROWD

No!!  What happened?!  Oh.  God.

PRESS REPORTER 1

ELAINE

How can you bring that up at a time

like this?

JANE

-- I heard him say, "Die bitch".

MAX

-- He was a controlling madman, she

was a prisoner.  I blame myself...

I should have done more to stop

it...

NICOLA

-- It was strange.  He wanted to

replace her with me in his new

movie... and I know I'm not that

good.

DETECTIVE

-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm

just trying to understand.  All

these films, TV appearances,

magazine covers, internet

interviews, publicity photos,

snapshots from her childhood -- all

fake.

(referring to various

items)

This is fake, this is fake -- fake,

fake, fake, all fake.

VIKTOR

That's right.  You understand

perfectly.  I will confess to

fraud, not murder.

DETECTIVE

(referring to oversize

mail bags)

A fan club with a worldwide

membership in the millions -- also

bogus?

VIKTOR

Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But

they were worshipping computer code

-- ones and zeros.

DETECTIVE

So, of course, you couldn't kill

Simone because there never was a

Simone.

VIKTOR

Of course.

DETECTIVE

And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you

talk so much about, a renowned

failure, who also happens to be so

conveniently dead -- perhaps the

"man" you claim helped invent

Simone is an invention himself?

DETECTIVE

(patronizing smile)

But not everyone's imaginary, are

they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of

course, to Edith.

VIKTOR

Who?

DETECTIVE

The woman you admitted to a

journalist is Simone's mother and

for whose silence you paid a

fortune?  Is she not flesh to you --

are her tears not wet?

OLD LADY

My BABY!

VIKTOR

She's insane!  This whole thing is

insane!  There is no Simone.  Look!

(grabbing a Simone poster)

Even her name is fake.  It's not

Simone.

(he tears Simone's name in

half to demonstrate)

It's SIM... ONE!  Simulation One!

DETECTIVE 2

(regarding Simone's face

also torn in half)

You really hated her, didn't you?

DETECTIVE

Perhaps you could explain this to

me, Mr. Taransky -- or is this tape

"doctored" too?

DETECTIVE

It's footage from the marina's

closed-circuit camera on the night

in question.  Altered, of course.

Is that really what you expect us

to believe, Mr. Taransky?

DETECTIVE

Can you tell us why you were

disposing of the body of a woman

who didn't exist?

VIKTOR

It wasn't her body.  It was her

body of work.

DETECTIVE

Why don't you just come clean,

Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll

feel better afterwards.

VIKTOR

I am telling the truth.

DETECTIVE

(coming close to him)

We all know what happened.  In a

fit of jealous rage you killed

Simone and dumped her body off a

boat she bought for you.

VIKTOR

No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll

take you to her.

VIKTOR

(panicky, desperately

grabbing the divers)

Did you find anything else --

drivers, discs... disc-drives?

DIVER 1

Nothing.

LAWYER

-- Plead guilty and throw yourself

on the mercy of the court.  It's

the best deal you're going to get.

VIKTOR

(incredulous)

I could get the death penalty.

LAWYER

You certainly will if you go to

trial -- a jury in this kind of

ugly mood.  You've killed an icon,

for God's sake.

VIKTOR

I didn't kill anyone, Bernard,

there was no one to kill!

LAWYER

(musing)

An insanity defence.

ELAINE

Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing

here.

LAINEY

Just a minute.

ELAINE

God, it's so like your father.  Why

can't people take responsibility

for their actions anymore?  I can

almost forgive him for killing

Simone -- but denying her

existence.  I can never forgive

that.

LAINEY

Because obviously she existed,

right?

ELAINE

I know it as surely as you're

sitting here, sweetheart.  She was

the most vital woman I ever met.

LAINEY

So you did meet her?

ELAINE

Of course.  What are you

suggesting?

LAINEY

I mean really meet her -- in the

flesh.

LAINEY

I know it's embarrassing to admit

it, mom, but when I think about it

-- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it

feels like I have.  I know more

about her than members of my own

family.  She's even in my dreams.

But I realized, going back through

my diary, they were all TV

appearances, near misses at

parties, second-hand rumor, gossip

on the internet.  I've never

actually seen Simone up close,

touched her, been in her physical

presence.  Have you?

ELAINE

(unable to refute it)

Well, I --

LAINEY

-- We don't believe daddy because

we don't want to believe we were

taken in too.

ELAINE

(trying to shake the

notion from her head)

Lainey, there's no evidence that

Simone isn't real.

LAINEY

Listen to what you're saying, mom.

Is there any evidence she is?

LAINEY

(regarding the disc)

There's one part of dad's story

that may have been true.  Simone

may have contracted a virus.

LAINEY

Certain viruses can be cured.

LAWYER

(hushed tones, referring

to a thick Psychiatric

Report)

... Listen, I've found a

psychiatrist in Ventura -- well

respected -- who's willing to

testify under oath that you have

diminished capacity due to the

trauma of your divorce, ten years

of abject failure in the movie

business and a bump on the head you

sustained as a child --

VIKTOR

-- No!  I can't go along with this

horseshit!  Just tell them they can

fry me!

LAWYER

(aghast, looking around to

see if anyone has heard)

What?!

VIKTOR

It was premeditated -- I knew

exactly what I was doing!  I

strangled her!  I bludgeoned her!

I set her on fire!  I did it!  I

killed her!

DETECTIVE (O.S.)

(clearing his throat)

Excuse me.

DETECTIVE

I think you'd better see this.

VBC ANCHOR

(from TV)

-- Breaking news -- international

media star, Simone, is alive and

well.  Her studio released this

footage only minutes ago...

VBC ANCHOR

... Simone reading today's edition

of the L.A. Times.  Who says, "The

only bad publicity is your

obituary"?  Details at the top of

the hour.

VIKTOR

You're indestructible.

DETECTIVE

(shaking his head in pity)

I'll never get you Hollywood

people.

VIKTOR

(relaxing back into his

seat)

Thank you!

(to Lainey)

I don't know how you did it but

thank you.

ELAINE

(putting her arm around

him)

Don't thank us too fast, Viktor.

You know what we have to do?

VIKTOR

(resigned smile)

Why stop at one character when you

can have a whole cast?

ELAINE

Exactly.  Now that you have the

studio behind you, we can really do

things.

ELAINE

(holding Viktor close)

I was thinking -- what about you

and... "Simone" moving back in with

me and Lainey?

VIKTOR

(meeting her gaze)

That sounds wonderful.

(to Lainey)

How do you feel about all this,

Lainey?

LAINEY

(beaming)

About you and mom?

VIKTOR

(reluctant admission)

Me and Simone.  What I did.

LAINEY

(sweet smile)

Your mistake wasn't making

something fake, daddy.  We're fine

with fake -- as long as you don't

lie about it.

ELAINE

(kissing him on the cheek)

Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's

not a death sentence.

VIKTOR

(still staring out of the

window, a rueful smile)

No... it's life.

FRANK BRAND

-- Simone, the question on

everyone's mind is simply... "why?"

SIMONE

Frank, you know as well as I do,

living in a fish bowl, the

insatiable appetite of the media...

SIMONE

With everything that was going on

in my life, I just needed to drop

out of sight for a while -- I

needed time.  Viktor bought me that

time.  I owe him so much.

FRANK BRAND

We all do.

(quickly returning to

Simone)

But now I understand you're eager

to get back to work -- and not the

kind of work that we're all

expecting.

SIMONE

(smiles coyly)

That's true.  I can reveal that I

am considering a career in

politics.

FRANK BRAND

And what may I ask brought this on?

SIMONE

I suppose this little man had

something to do with it.  Viktor

and I are both concerned about what

kind of world our new son, Chip, is

going to grow up in.

(turning lovingly to

Viktor)

Aren't you, Viktor?

VIKTOR

(turning lovingly to

Simone)

Yes.
