close to us.

BRANCH

Heading?

Spock . . . !

FEMALE MASTER

Here are these sands, our fore-

bearers cast out their animal

passions. Here our race was

saved by the first attainment of

Kolinahr.

MALE MASTER

Kolinahr: the final shedding of

all emotion.

FEMALE MASTER

You have labored long, Spock.

Now receive from us this symbol

of total logic.

FEMALE MASTER

(gestures Spock forward)

Come, give me your thoughts.

FEMALE MASTER

(continuing)

Our minds, Spock... One and

together....

FEMALE MASTER

(continuing; sadly)

This consciousness which calls --

it stirs your human half, Spock?

You have not achieved Kolinahr --

Your human emotions are not fully

extinguished.

(turns to the other Masters)

He will not achieve his goal with

us. His answer lies elsewhere.

KIRK

Commander Sonak... !

KIRK

(continuing)

You've received your appointment

as Enterprise Science Officer?

SONAK

(nods)

Based, I am told, on your

recommendation, Admiral. Thank

you.

KIRK

Why aren't you on board?

SONAK

Captain Decker requested I complete

final Science briefing here before...

KIRK

(interrupting)

Here at Starfleet...? The

Enterprise is in final preparation

to leave dock...

SONAK

Which will require twenty more

hours at minimum, Admiral...

KIRK

Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting

with Admiral Nogura which will not

last more than three minutes.

Report to me on the Enterprise in

one hour.

SONAK

To you, sir?

KIRK

I intend to be there following

that meeting. Report to me. One

hour!

SCOTT

Admiral, I've been hoping to see

you. Maybe you can get through

to those thick heads in Starfleet

that...

KIRK

Why aren't the Enterprise

transporters in operation, Mister

Scott?

SCOTT

We're hoping it's only a temporary

problem, Admiral...

KIRK

See that it is.

(moving toward pod)

Take me over, please.

SCOTT

(carefully)

Admiral, the Enterprise has just

finished eighteen months redesign-

ing and refitting. She needs

testing, a shakedown...

KIRK

Mr. Scott, there's an alien object

with unbelievable destructive

power less than three days away

from this planet...

KIRK

(continuing)

... the only Starship in

interception range is the

Enterprise! Ready, or not, she

launches in twelve hours!

SCOTT

The crew hasn't had near enough

transition time with all the new

equipment. And the engines,

Admiral: they've yet to be even

tested at warp power. Add to

that, an untried Captain...

KIRK

(hint of smile)

Two and a half years as Chief of

Starfleet Operations may have

made me a little stale, Mr. Scott

-- but I wouldn't exactly consider

myself 'untried.'

KIRK

(continuing)

They gave her back to me, Scotty.

SCOTT

"Gave' her back, sir...? I doubt

it was that easy...

(returns smile)

But any man who could manage such

a feat, I wouldna dare disappoint.

She'll launch on time, sir...

(with confidence)

And she'll be ready.

Captain... Starfleet just

signaled your transfer-of-

command orders!

67   ANOTHER ANGLE - VARIOUS REACTION                            67

KIRK

I appreciate the welcome; I wish

the circumstances were less

critical.

(to Uhura)

Epsilon Nine is monitoring the

intruder; keep a channel open to

them.

(glances around)

Where is Captain Decker?

SULU

He's in Engineering, sir...

(uncomfortable,

indicates Captain's

chair)

He doesn't know.

KIRK

Mr Chekov, assemble the crew on

the Rec Deck at 0400 hours. I

want to show them what we're

facing.

SULU

I wouldn't have wanted to have

been standing in his way. He

wanted her back; he got her!

ALIEN ENSIGN

(perturbed)

And Captain Decker? He's been

with the ship every minute of

her refitting...

UHURA

(brittle)

Ensign -- our chances of coming

back from this mission in one

piece may have just doubled...!

DECKER

(quietly elated)

I thought so! See... the trans-

porter sensor was not activated...

SCOTT

(impressed)

Aye, you were dead right about

that...

(to Technician)

Clearly, put a back-up sensor into

the unit.

72   ACROSS THEM TO KIRK                                         72

DECKER

Admiral Kirk...

(shakes Kirk's hand)

We're getting a top brass send

off...?

(self assured grin)

She'll launch on schedule if we

have to tow her out with our bare

hands. Right, Scotty?

SCOTTY

(lamely)

Aye, sir, that we will...

KIRK

(to Decker)

Will, let's go over here and

talk.

DECKER

Let me now when the back-up is

in place.

DECKER

All due respect, sir, I hope

this isn't a Starfleet pep talk;

I'm just too busy.

KIRK

I'm taking over the Center seat.

I'm sorry, Will.

DECKER

You are what...?

KIRK

I'm replacing you as Captain of

the Enterprise.

KIRK

(continuing)

You'll stay aboard as Executive

Officer... a temporary grade

reduction to Commander.

DECKER

(finding his voice)

-- You, personally, are assuming

command?

KIRK

Yes.

DECKER

May I ask Why?

KIRK

(nods)

My experience -- five years out

there dealing with unknowns like

this -- my familiarity with the

Enterprise, this crew...

DECKER

Admiral, this is an almost totally

new enterprise. You don't know

her a tenth as well as I do.

75   ANOTHER ANGLE - TO SHOW SCOTT IN B.G. (ACROSS THE           75

KIRK

That's why you're staying aboard.

I'm sorry, Will.

DECKER

No, Admiral. I don't think you are;

not one damned bit. I remember

when you recommended me for this

command. You told me how envious

you were, and if only you could

find a way to get a starship

command again. Well, sir, it looks

like you found a way.

KIRK

Report to the bridge, Commander.

Immediately.

TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)

Transporter room, come in!

Urgent!

Redline on the transporters,

Mister Scott!

Starfleet, boost your matter gain;

we need more signal!

Oh, no! They're forming!

Starfleet, do you have them?

STARFLEET VOICE

(shaken)

Enterprise... what we got back

didn't live long. Fortunately.

KIRK

Starfleet... Kirk. Please...

express my condolences to their

families. Commander Sonak's

can be reached through the Vulcan

Embassy.

expression)

There was nothing you could have

done, Rand. It wasn't your fault.

KIRK

We'll have to replace Commander

Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan

there, if possible...

DECKER

None available, Captain. There's

no one in fact, who's fully rated

on this design.

KIRK

You are, Mister Decker. I'm

afraid you'll have to double as

Science Officer.

And Kirk moves on, Decker stands gazing reflectively

after him.

Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was

my phaser order countermanded?

DECKER

(cool, polite)

Sir, the Enterprise redesign

increases phaser power by

channeling it through the main

engines. When they went into

anti-matter imbalance, the

phasers were automatically cut

off.

Then you acted properly, of course.

Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar-

rassed you.

Sir, you haven't logged a single

star hour in two and a half years.

Yes.

Captain... I read an oxygen and

gravity envelope forming outside

the Enterprise...!

UHURA

Sir, I have located the source

of V'ger's radio signal: (it's)

directly ahead.

SPOCK

That transmitter is a vital link

between V'ger and the Creator.

KIRK

Mr. Decker... I will contact you

every five minutes. Otherwise...

inform Mr. Scott immediately.

DECKER

(calls after him)

Captain... I'd like to go along...

KIRK

Mr. Sulu, you have the conn...

KIRK

V'ger plans to literally

meld

to reduce both itself and the

Creator to patterns...

SPOCK

... and then to reassemble itself

combined

with the Creator. The

most certain way of obtaining

all the Creator's answers.

KIRK

(to "Ilia")

Our data is being prepared.

of our answer when it is ready!

Problem, Captain: the response

signal is not in our records.

Voyager Six was sent out by Earth's

"United States Subdivision.' The

code was probably...

data from rival subdivisions.

McCOY

That's preposterous! They

wouldn't have kept

scientific

data from one another.

CHEKOV'S INTERCOM VOICE

We are now checking with Starfleet

Archives, Captain. Stand by.

McCOY

And when it realizes what the

Creator is...?

KIRK

There's no way to know. V'ger

expected it to be a machine --

some single entity.

(indicates entire

site)

All of us here may be reduced

into patterns...

SPOCK

That seems to be what it has

planned -- to have the Creator

physically present here.

McCOY

(small smile)

The God it captures is going to

be a hell of a disappointment.

UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE

Affirmative, Captain. For some

time now.

KIRK

Confirm code and transmitting

frequency.

CHEKOV'S INTERCOM VOICE

Both signal and frequency

confirmed, sir.

DECKER

(continuing)

The fault is here, sir, not in

the transmission.

(indicating into

hatch)

The antenna leads have been

disconnected. V'ger never

intended to accept a transmitted

signal.

KIRK

Capture God! In order to

retrieve V'ger's data, the

Creator has to physically come

here!...

DECKER

And plug the signal directly into

the circuitry at this...

(indicates into

access)

... point here, Captain. It

should pick up even a tricorder

playback.

KIRK

(lifting communicator)

Enterprise, I want that signal

again. Transmit!

Yes, Captain. It needed our

mortality, the fear of it, our

struggle against it, our fears,

our dreams...

KIRK

... and the 'foolish' emotions

which drive us?

SPOCK

(looks at Kirk; then)

I prefer your poet Dante's phrase

-- 'the divine restlessness of

the human spirit.'

McCOY

Spock... you're quoting poetry?

Starfleet signal, Captain!

Return to orbital dockyard for

inspection.

KIRK

Ignore that signal.

(to Scott)

Shall we give the Enterprise a

proper shakedown, Mr. Scott?

SCOTT

(suddenly beaming)

I'd say it's time for that, I

would, sir.

We can have you back on Vulcan
