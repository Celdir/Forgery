SEBASTIAN

Damnit.

SEBASTIAN (cont d)

Damnit.

LATER:

SEBASTIAN

(beat)

I am a goddamn genius.

LINDA

Sebastian, do you know what time it

is?

SEBASTIAN (SCREEN)

You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it

was waste of time.

LINDA

What is it this time?

SEBASTIAN

Who s that?

LINDA

Not your business. Not anymore.

SEBASTIAN

Touche.

LINDA

So you calling about anything in

particular, or were you just hoping to

catch me sleeping in the nude?

SEBASTIAN

I cracked the reversion.

LINDA

You cracked it?

SEBASTIAN

Look at this.

SEBASTIAN

Watch this.

LINDA

You sure?

SEBASTIAN

91% sure.

LINDA

(astonished)

Eleven months with no progress and you

suddenly come up with it out of the

blue? How?

SEBASTIAN

The usual. Coffee and twinkies.

LINDA

I hate you.

SEBASTIAN

I know. You think you could hunt down

Matt and get to the lab early. I want

Isabelle prepped for a live test.

LINDA

Yeah, I think I can find him. What are

you going to do?

SEBASTIAN

Well y know. It s daylight in

Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel

Committee and tell them to get our

prizes ready. See you in a few.

LINDA

Hey... come on.

MATT

(groggy)

What?

LINDA

Sebastian just called. We gotta get to

the lab.

MATT

Shit! You didn t tell him I was here,

did you?

LINDA

Give me some credit, will ya.

MATT

So what s the rush?

LINDA

He cracked reversion.

MATT

Wanna ride down?

LINDA

We better take our own cars.

MATT

You re gonna have to tell him about us

eventually.

LINDA

I know. It s just You re his best

friend. He ll feel betrayed.

MARINE GUARD

Morning, sir.

SEBASTIAN

Morning, Ed.

MARINE GUARD

Your team s in early. Something

special going on?

SEBASTIAN

Sorry, Ed. You know the rules.

MARINE GUARD

Have a good day, sir.

ELEVATOR (V.0.)

Authorization please.

SEBASTIAN

Caine zero zero two seven.

ELEVATOR (V.0.)

Authorization verified. Good morning,

Dr. Caine.

MATT

Isabelle ...

MATT (cont d)

Calm down baby. Calm down. It s

okay...

MATT (cont d)

It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not

going to hurt you. Come here.

MATT (cont d)

Just hold still.

MATT (cont d)

Ow, shit.

LINDA

You okay?

MATT

She bit me.

LINDA

Yeah. She s become a lot more

aggressive in the last few days.

LINDA (cont d)

Go take care of that bite. I ll get

her.

MATT

And give you a chance to pull ahead?

Never.

MATT

(ala Porky)

Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting

simians.   heheheheh.

LINDA

Knock it off.

(soothing voice)

Isabelle!

MATT

Good shootin , Tex.

LINDA

What s that make it?

MATT

I m still ahead. 6 to 5.

LINDA

But I m catching up.

SARAH

Can I have a word?

SEBASTIAN

Most normal people say good morning.

SARAH

Don t you think you should test the

protocol on the liver samples before

you inject Isabelle?

SEBASTIAN

How many tissue samples have we

successfully regressed? Hundreds,

right? How many have gone on to work

on the full system? None.

SARAH

That s beside the point.

SEBASTIAN

No, that is the point. I m not going

to waste six months of my life on an

outmoded testing procedure. This thing

works. I know it. I feel it.

SARAH

Fine. You can mop up afterward.

SEBASTIAN

You think I m going to kill Isabelle?

SARAH

Kill? More like liquefy.

SEBASTIAN

Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but

I m the project leader. Understand?

SARAH

Yes, Sir.

SEBASTIAN

How did you ever convince me to hire

her?

LINDA

You said you wanted the beat vet in

the country.

SEBASTIAN

Yeah, well she cares more about the

animals than the research.

LINDA

Maybe that s why she s so good.

SEBASTIAN

Who da Man? You da Man.

MATT

As we pull out we see we are.

MATT

Protocol is hot.

SEBASTIAN

Vitals?

SARAH

Normal.

BOOMING VOICE

THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE

NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE

SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY.

GOD HAS SPOKEN.

SEBASTIAN

How many times do I have to tell you,

Frank you aren t God.

(beat)

I am.

FRANK (LOUDSPEAKER)

Sorry, Boss. Forgot.

SEBASTIAN

You guys ready to roll?

FRANK

We are live and in color. On your

mark.

SEBASTIAN

Okay. Roll  em.

JANICE

Okay. We are rolling record on videos

one through twelve.

FRANK (V.O.)

Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in

phase shift... one hundred twenty six

days, eighteen hours.

LINDA

Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting

serial protein Caine One Two Five.

MATT

Maybe if you stopped naming them after

yourself, you d have better luck.

SEBASTIAN

Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for

that keen scientific observation. I ll

be sure to include it in my memoirs.

MATT

A whole mention? And I thought I was

just gonna be a footnote.

MATT

Okay.

SEBASTIAN

(to Linda)

Ready.

LINDA

Propped.

MATT

Let s make some history.

SEBASTIAN

Nice try, Sparky.

LINDA

Come on, Isabelle. You can do this.

SARAH

Elevated heartbeat.

JANICE

We re still in the green.

FRANK

Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal

range.

MATT

It s reacting.

SEBASTIAN

Do you see this?

LINDA

It s working. It s actually working.

SARAH

Heart rate s up. She s scared.

SARAH (cont d)

It's okay, baby. It's okay.

SEBASTIAN

Subject began manifesting almost

Immediately. Protocol is reacting

quickly.

LINDA

Subject may be in pain or extreme

discomfort.

SARAH

Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating.

Brain activity going through the roof.

SARAH (cont d)

We ve got a problem.

SEBASTIAN

What? What problem!

SARAH

It s her heart. We can see the heart

beating in the ape s

FRANK (V.0.)

I got an erratic heart beat.

SARAH

She s going into cardiac arrest.

LINDA

Got the crash cart.

SARAH

We re losing her.

SEBASTIAN

No! It s got to work.

LINDA

Clear!

SARAH

We ve got something!

SARAH (cont d)

Still. erratic.

LINDA

Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do

it. You can fucking do it.

SARAH

Come on, monkey.

MATT

Do it. Do it. Come on.

SARAH

Stabilizing.

FRANK (V.0.)

Brain activity returning to normal.

LINDA

Welcome back, Isabelle.

SEBASTIAN

(beat)

How is she?

SARAH

(surprised)

I think she s gonna be okay

CARTER

Amazing. She's normal, absolutely

healthy. If you didn't know any

better, you'd think nothing had

happened to her.

MATT

(ribbing Sarah)

Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her

brain and trace her neural pathways.

SARAH

Screw you, Matt.

MATT

Well maybe not right away.

LINDA

We should celebrate.

SEBASTIAN

To the finest research team I've ever

known.

SEBASTIAN

Hey...

LINDA

I thought you'd gone.

SEBASTIAN

Where would I go?

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

Twenty years ago there were no

computers, no fax machines, no cell

phones. I was just wondering what the

world will be like twenty years from

now... if what we're doing will change

everything.

LINDA

A little "I am become death... the

shatterer of worlds"?

SEBASTIAN

Something like that.

LINDA

Since the day I met, all you wanted to

do was change the world.

LINDA (cont'd)

Listen, I know we've... I mean... well

... I just want you to know how proud

I am of you. I know it probably

doesn't mean a lot...

SEBASTIAN

Actually it does.

(beat)

I guess since you were there from the

beginning, you know me better than

anyone else on this godforsaken

planet.

LINDA

You're positively maudlin. You should

be happy. Do you have any idea what

you've accomplished?

SEBASTIAN

Yeah... but I was working so hard, I

didn't realize I'd have no one to

share it with.

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

I don't suppose we could turn back the

clock for a night and you could come

home with me?

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

Right. Sorry. Too much champagne.

MATT

What was that about?

LINDA

Nothing. It's just... He is who he is.

Sometimes I just have to be reminded.

SEBASTIAN

(a little drunk)

What's it like? Talk goddamnit! Tell

me what it's like!

SEBASTIAN (V.0.)

Six years ago, this committee

commissioned me with a very specific

task...

SEBASTIAN

To successful phase-shift a human

being out of quantum sync with the

visible universe and then return him

safely, with no after affects.

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

Well, we found out sending them to

"never-never-land" was easy, it's the

getting back that's hard.

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

Every time we've tried to bring a test

subject back from phase-shift.

Cellular bonds would dissolve, the

primary DNA strands would decay. But

now...

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

But now...

KRAMER

But now?

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)

But now...

(pause)

But now, we feel we are closer than

ever to resolving this issue. We've

been experimenting with a new

regression formula that looks rather

promising.

A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward.

GENERAL

How long?

SEBASTIAN

Sir?

GENERAL

Son, as you can imagine, we are very

anxious to field test this tactical

asset. How long till you resolve this

issue?

SEBASTIAN

Shouldn't be more than another year,

Sir.

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

Maybe sooner.

MATT

Yo. Reality check! What the hell was

that about?

SEBASTIAN

Keep your voice down.

MATT

The protocol works. Why'd you tell

them it didn't?

SEBASTIAN

I wasn't ready for them to know.

MATT

But they're the oversight committee.

They're supposed to know.

LINDA

I'm sure he had a reason.

(firmly)

You did have a reason, didn't you,

Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN

I had more than a reason. I had a

goddamn epiphany.

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

What do you think they'd do if they

know we could send a subject into

phase shift and pull it back out

again? How many seconds would it take

for them to take over the whole

project, bringing in their soldiers to

test the formula on. We'd have lost

control of it by the end of the week.

LINDA

It's their money, Sebastian. It's

going to happen eventually.

SEBASTIAN

I know. But not yet. There's too much

for us to learn. I don't want my hands

tied by their political agenda when we

go to phase three.

MATT

Well, then... mind telling us how

you're gonna get a human test-subject

for phase three without the committee

finding out?

SEBASTIAN

That's easy. I've decided to test the

procedure ...

SEBASTIAN

... on myself.

FRANK

Are you nuts?

SEBASTIAN

Was Jonas Salk nuts?

FRANK

Yeah. Pretty sure he was.

CARTER

And remember, for every Jonas Salk,

there are a bunch of guys who aren't

famous cuz they died.

SEBASTIAN

If we're that unsure, how can we

morally justify testing it on someone

else?

JANICE

Isn't it a little soon to be moving

into phase three anyway?

SARAH

She's right. We haven't even finished

collating the phase two research.

SEBASTIAN

We'll have plenty of time to collate

and cross-reference later. Monkey data

doesn't matter anyway. The only real

data is human data.

SARAH

You don't even know if any of the

protocols will work on humans.

SEBASTIAN

How are we gonna find out? Besides,

we've succeeded with a gorilla and

their DNA is 98% the same as humans.

And the 2% is not that significant.

LINDA

Sebastian ... humans can talk, build

houses and cook in microwave ovens.

Gorilla's live in trees. That's a

helluva 2% if you ask me.

SEBASTIAN

We're all concerned. I know that. But

if we're gonna move forward ever, this

is something we have to do.

LINDA

Why you? Why not one of us?

SEBASTIAN

The risks. I couldn't ask...

MATT

(interrupting)

What if we volunteer?

LINDA

What if you're too valuable to lose?

SEBASTIAN

I'm Project Leader. It's my formula

and my call. The best way to express

your concern is to make damn sure you

do your best work. I'll want about

four weeks to...

FRANK

To put your affairs in order?

SEBASTIAN

To run some more reversions and tissue

tests and then we'll attempt the phase

shift. I'll stay shifted for three

days of testing and then we'll perform

a quantum regression.

SEBASTIAN

Come in.

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

What?

LINDA

In the past six years, I've never once

challenged your decisions, but this

... Sebastian. I don't think you

should do this.

SEBASTIAN

You don't understand.

LINDA

Oh please. How long were we together?

You must've said it a million times

... Nobody knows who built the lunar

lander. All they remember in the first

man on the moon.

LINDA (cont'd)

But what if something happens to

you... what about the project?

SEBASTIAN

Lin, trust me... nothing's going to

happen.

LINDA

He refuses to listen to reason.

MATT

Can we talk about this later? I'm

trying to make love to you.

LINDA

Sorry. I just can't let it go.

MATT

I know how you're feeling. Hell, he

and I've been friends since freshman

year.

LINDA

So how can we let him do this?

MATT

What if you were given the opportunity

to be the first person on ,Mars, would

you go?

LINDA

In a heartbeat.

MATT

What if they didn't know whether or

not they could get you home?

MATT (cont'd)

This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager

or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I

were him I'd do the same thing.

LINDA

Let me ask another question.

MATT

Is about who gets to be on top?

LINDA

Is the human race really ready for

what we're doing?

MATT

Why do you always get philosophical

before we're about to get physical?

LINDA

No really. Is it ready? We're

barrelling down a road that begs moral

and ethical questions that I don't

think we can answer.

MATT

They said the same thing about the

bomb. They said we'd never survive the

nuclear age... but here we are.

LINDA

This night is still young.

(beat)

I mean, when you think about it, it's

creepy. Do we really want to live in a

world where people can just disappear

in the blink of an eye?

MATT

We made our deal with the devil years

ago. Might as well stick around to

cash in.

SEBASTIAN

(his voice catches)

Yes?

MATT

We're ready.

SEBASTIAN

Okay.

MATT

It's not too late to back out. I'm

happy to take your place.

SEBASTIAN

No. I'm ready.

MATT

Nervous?

SEBASTIAN

A little.

MATT

Ever tell you the one about Superman

and Wonder Woman?

SEBASTIAN

I don't think so.

MATT

So Superman's flying around the city,

and he's horny as hell.  Lo and behold

he looks down and sees Wonder Woman,

completely nude, sunning herself up on

the roof of the Justice League. I mean

she is lying there naked and spread

eagle. So Superman starts thinking,

"man... this is too easy. I could go

down there, do a little fast pumping

and be gone before she even sees me."

After all he is faster than a speeding

bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down,

takes care of business so quick, you

can't even see him. Well ... I tell

ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised

as hell and says "What the hell was

that." And the Invisible Man replies

"I dunno know, but it sure hurt like

hell."

SEBASTIAN

You know, that could be the last joke

I ever hear.

MATT

C'mon, man. That's funny shit.

LINDA

O.K. How're you feeling?

Sebastian takes a deep breath.

SEBASTIAN

Fine.

SARAH

Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit

elevated.

SEBASTIAN

To be expected.

SARAH

No reason for concern. He's ready.

SEBASTIAN

Hey... it's gonna be okay.

LINDA

Start recording.

JANICE

We're hot. All systems nominal,

Houston.

FRANK

Okay, kids. Let's make some history.

LINDA

Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs.

MATT

(to Linda)

Ready.

MATT (cont'd)

If the tests are any indication it

should work quickly.

SEBASTIAN

I'll inject myself. If anything goes

wrong, they can't blame you.

LINDA

We can still shut down, Sebastian.

MATT

Any last words?

SEBASTIAN

Yeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said

something deep and clever.

LINDA

Injection was administered at

(checks watch)

... 18:23:47.

LINDA (cont'd)

Keep talking. Tell us what you're

feeling.

SEBASTIAN

Nothing so far.

SARAH

Vitals are stable.

LINDA

Nothing's happening.

MATT

Human DNA structure is slightly more

complex... it's possible that it may

take more time...

LINDA

Maybe we overlooked something.

SEBASTIAN

Recheck the protocol. It can't be non-

reactive.

CARTER

Kinda like a firecracker with a bad

fuse...

CARTER (cont'd)

Don't know if it'll go off.

LINDA

Frank?

FRANK (V.0.)

(from the booth)

No change in bio-electric.

SEBASTIAN

Goddammit.

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

Okay wait, my arm... it's getting a

bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's

starting to tingle...

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

Okay... it's spreading to my back...

like, like a fever...

LINDA

Here we go.

SEBASTIAN

Shit... it's starting to burn... Oh

god. It hurts. I didn't think it would

hurt.

SARAH

Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 100.

... 130 ...

LINDA

What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP

TALKING!

SEBASTIAN

Pain!

SARAH

Pulse is 165 ... 170 Blood pressure

180 over 100. ...

CARTER

He's going to blow out his heart.

LINDA

Prop the crash cart.

MATT

We've got to stop it!

LINDA

We can't!

JANICE

Something's happening.

FRANK

Listen up! Electric activity

increasing in all limbs. Brainwaves

are through the roof.

JANICE

I didn't think the human brain could

spike that high.

FRANK

Maybe it can't.

SEBASTIAN

No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!

SARAH

Pulse is 180 .... holding stable.

CARTER

Holy shit.

SARAH

Pulse is dropping. 170..

150 .... 160..

LINDA

Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at

18:26.

MATT

Is he dead?

LINDA

No. He passed out from the trauma.

SARAH

Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110

... dropping. Blood pressure 130 over

75.

FRANK (V.O.)

Electrical activity is stabilizing.

SARAH

Pulse steady at 70.

MATT

Un-fucking-believable.

LINDA

(whispers in his ear)

You did it, Sebastian. You're the

first.

CARTER

Let's get him into recovery.

MATT

S'okay. You nodded off.

LINDA

His breathing's hypnotic. How long's

it been?

MATT

Seventeen hours.

LINDA

Where are the others?

MATT

In the lab crunching numbers. We've

got enough data there for two

lifetimes of research.

LINDA

I keep looking at that hole, wondering

if he's really there.

LINDA (cont'd)

Did you see...

MATT

He may be coming out of it.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

The lights! Turn off the goddamn

lights! Ah Christ!

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

I can't... I can't close my eyes. I

can't close my eyes.

LINDA

Your eyelids are transparent.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

So I ... I'm...

LINDA

Yes.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel

them...

LINDA

Your arms ... your whole body... It

worked, Sebastian. It worked.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Mirror. I ... I want to see.

MATT

Over here in the corner.

MATT (cont'd)

What was it like?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

I ... It's hard to think.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

The transformation... I remember every

molecule in my body shattering.

MATT

It was painful?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

At first... but then everything went

black. I couldn't see or hear or feel

anything. It was all just black...

like I wasn't connected.

LINDA

Your system received quite a shock.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

At least my senses are starting to

return... You're wearing your

Shalimar, aren't you?

LINDA

Sebastian.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

This is weird. I'm looking through

myself at the floor. I'm looking right

through myself. I can't tell ...

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

... where my body is.

LINDA

Sebastian?

MATT

Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

You really can't see me. Can you?

LINDA

Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea,

headache, body-ache, disorientation.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

No, just tired.

(beat)

It's funny. I can see everything...

more than before... but I can't see

myself.

CARTER

Hey. How's he doing?

LINDA

Why don't you ask him?

SARAH

Sebastian, how do you feel.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Not to bad, considering.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

Odd, isn't it?

LINDA

He can't close his eyes so they're

sensitive to light.

JANICE

So, what was it like?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Over here.

LINDA

C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Sorry. Couldn't resist.

FRANK

I feel like we're playing Marco Polo.

MATT

Well, I see the procedure hasn't

changed your personality.

FRANK

No worries. I'm on it.

FRANK (cont'd)

Gotcha, big man.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Boy, you people have no sense of

humor.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

Show me. So ...

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Stop there.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

Index that. That was when it started

burn. Epidermal reaction.

JANICE

Index Mark. 112125.

LINDA

It's late. Time you got some rest.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Just a little longer.

LINDA

Hate to pull rank, but you're my

patient now and you need rest. We've

got a busy day tomorrow.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Fine.

LINDA

We've set up a thermal camera for

observation and I've arranged one of

us to be here 24/7 in case you need

anything. The team's gonna be on alpha-

call alert for the duration. If

anything goes wrong, we can all be

here within...

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote

the procedure.

LINDA

I was trying to be reassuring.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

You like this don't you?

LINDA

What's that?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Being in charge.

LINDA

Please. I'm just doing my job.

LINDA

You gonna be okay?

SARAH

Fine. It's not like I have anything

else going on in my sad pathetic life.

LINDA

Carter'll be in at six to spell you

and I'll be in by nine. Call me if

anything happens, okay?

SARAH

I'm fine. Go on ahead.

CARTER

Man, I'm tired. That was a long day.

LINDA

Days only get longer from here.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

(whispering)

Sarah. Are you awake?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

(barely audible)

Hmm.

SARAH

Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are

you in here?

SARAH (cont'd)

Dr. Caine?

SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)

Dr. Caine, please report in.

SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)

Dr. Caine, report in please!

SARAH

Shit.

SARAH (cont'd)

Dr. Caine? Sebastian? Come on, this

isn't funny. I know you're in here.

SARAH (cont'd)

I must be going crazy.

SARAH

I found him later in the lab, running

samples.

LINDA

Why didn't you call me?

SARAH

Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not.

I mean, I could've easily been

dreaming.

MATT

It doesn't sound like something

Sebastian would do.

SARAH

God, I feel so stupid.

LINDA

I can talk to him.

SARAH

No. I mean...

(she torn, unsure of herself)

It was probably nothing. I

shouldn't've mentioned it.

MATT

You sure?

SARAH

Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why

would he do that, right? Just, this

place at night can be kinda creepy,

y'know.

MATT

So, how was your first night?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't

close your eyes.

MATT

Yeah? What'd you do?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Got up a couple of times. Knocked

about.

MATT

Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in

your cubicle. She said she called you

over the intercom and you didn't

respond.

SEBASTIAN

I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio

on.

MATT

It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell

whoever's on duty where you're going

to. I mean, if something were to

happen, we'd want to know where to

find you.

SEBASTIAN

I didn't think it was a problem.

MATT

It isn't. I just don't want it to

become one.

MATT (cont'd)

Readings are normal.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Next I want to run a VV and UVF

analysis of the platelets.

MATT

We'll have to draw some more blood.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

You okay?

SARAH

Yeah. Why?

SEBASTIAN

You just seem a little nervous.

SARAH

No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This

might hurt a bit.

SARAH (cont'd)

Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid,

but are you... are you looking at me.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

No. I was looking at the clock. Why?

SARAH

Just felt like someone was staring at

me.

LINDA

Sebastian? Goddamnit.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

You've no idea how much fun I've had.

I'm going to hate going back.

LINDA

That's what worries me.?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

How so?

LINDA

What happens when we turn the project

over to the Army. Ever wonder how much

fun they're gonna have?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Maybe we won't give it to them. His

voice comes from behind her now.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

I was thinking... tonight's my last

night. Ever fantasize about making

love to an invisible man?

LINDA

Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Well, don't do it for me. Do it for

science.

LINDA

Grow up.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Oh well. Missed your big chance.

LINDA

Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow.

LINDA

Recording?

FRANK

Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian

Caine. Currently in phase shift...

Three days, seven hours.

LINDA

De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial

Protein Caine One Two Seven.

LINDA (cont'd)

Ready?

SEBASTIAN

Not really. I was just starting to

enjoy myself.

LINDA

Tough.

MATT

Okay, man. Here we go.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Wait... something... something doesn't

feel right.

SARAH

Heartbeat elevated.

FRANK

Vitals still nominal..

SEBASTIAN

I can't br... br...

LINDA

What's wrong?

SARAH

He's not breathing.

MATT

Subject manifesting.

SARAH

Pulse erratic.

LINDA

Carter!

LINDA (cont'd)

Sebastian! Sebastian!

LINDA (cont'd)

Sebastian!

MATT

Get a tranq. Stat.

LINDA

He's reverting. Got him on the table.

LINDA (cont'd)

Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven.

SARAH

I got no pulse. No pulse.

MATT

Start CPR.

CARTER

Getting a pulse.

MATT

Holy shit. What happened?

LINDA

Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you

hear me? How are his pupils?

MATT

I can't see his goddamn pupils!

SARAH

I think he's going into shock.

FADE

UP ON:

MATT

Just got the tissue sample results.

Cellular cohesion is stable.

MATT (cont'd)

How bout you? You gonna be okay?

LINDA

Guess so.

(beat)

I was just thinking about the Apollo

missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and

Chaffee... What it was like for them

on that launch pad that day, thinking

they were gonna reach the stars only

to burn to death.

MATT

Sometimes the test pilots make

history. Sometimes the planes crash

and people die.

LINDA

But he didn't die, did he?

(beat)

What if we can't bring him back? What

then?

MATT

It's just a little hitch is all. He'll

be the first to tell that he'll crack

it and I'm sure he will. It'll just

take time.

(beat)

Listen, let's got out of here. We

could drive up to the old observatory.

We'll take some wine and go count the

stars and forget all this for awhile.

LINDA

No. I want to be here for him.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

(weak)

Hey...

LINDA

Hey...

SEBASTIAN

So I guess it didn't work.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

You look worried. It must've been bad.

LINDA

You almost died.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Well, remember your Nietchze. Whatever

doesn't kill me, makes me stronger.

LINDA

I should be making you feel better.

Not vice versa.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

I guess if I'm going to be stuck this

way for awhile, I'd better make some

adjustments.

MATT

Not too bad.

SEBASTIAN

The latex'll limit the amount of light

delivered to my optic nerves.

LINDA

You could almost pass for human.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Well, it gives you a face to talk to

at least, and we can all work in

normal light again.

SEBASTIAN

The testing's making me sick.

LINDA

Could be the barium or the radiation.

MATT

You're physiology has changed and,

well, all bets are off.

SEBASTIAN

I can't believe I have to spend

another night here.

(to Linda)

Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet

up with that boyfriend of yours now.

LINDA

Do you want me to stay?

SEBASTIAN

No. That's okay. It's just, being a

guinea pig is more work than I

thought. I'll be fine.

CARTER

(surprised)

Dr. Caine. What's up?

SEBASTIAN

Just stopped by to let you know, I'm

going out for a bit.

CARTER

Going out? Hey wait a sec!

CARTER

What do you mean going out for a bit?

SEBASTIAN

If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna

go crazy.

CARTER

But you're not supposed to leave the

compound.

SEBASTIAN

Why not?

CARTER

That's the rule.

SEBASTIAN

Yes, but I made that rule. It's my

rule and I'm changing it.

CARTER

You can't just change it.

SEBASTIAN

Carter, I was suppose to be like this

for three days. Three fucking days and

I'll be damned if I'm going to spend

the rest of my life as a prisoner in

this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going

out. I'll be back in a couple of

hours. Okay?

CARTER

Shit.

CARTER

Yeah, it's Carter. We got a problem.

MARINE GUARD

Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile?

SEBASTIAN

Yeah, well. You know how it in

sometimes.

MARINE GUARD

You got that right, sir. I was

beginning to worry 'cause your car

hadn't moved.

SEBASTIAN

Thanks, but everything's cool.

MATT

He could be anywhere. Hell he could be

right behind us.

LINDA

I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna

swing by his place, just in case.

MATT

See you there.

LINDA

(quietly, looking around)

I don't want him to see.

MATT

(looking around too)

What a mess.

SEBASTIAN

Shit.

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

Don't even think it...

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

(almost whispering)

Once...just once.

LINDA

Sebastian?

LINDA

Sebastian?

LINDA

Oh shit.

LINDA (cont'd)

Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No.

He's taken his make-up off. I don't

know...He must be outside somewhere.

I don't know where he went. I'm coming

back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed

to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM!

We're going on alpha call.  I want

everyone at the lab now. We're gonna

need thermal visors and we may need

tranqs.

JANICE

What are the tranqs for?

LINDA

Use your imagination.

JANICE

Are you saying he's dangerous?

MATT

We're just saying we need to be

cautious.

LINDA

The Metro stops running after midnight

and he's on foot, so he can't have

gotten too far.

CARTER

Look, this isn't a monkey we're

talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't

you think you're over reacting?

LINDA

This program is classified. If he's

out there it means someone might find

out about him. He could destroy the

whole program.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out.

MATT

Where the hell have you been?

SEBASTIAN

I got a little stir crazy, so I went

to my apartment to pick up some stuff.

LINDA

Bullshit! I went to your apartment and

I happen to know you did a helluva lot

more than pick some stuff up.

SEBASTIAN

What are you talking about?

LINDA

You, of all people How could you?

LINDA (cont'd)

You put yourself and this project at

risk.

SEBASTIAN

Just what did you see in my apartment?

LINDA

I saw your face and your clothes.

MATT

It was bad enough you left without an

escort, but to take off the...

(he motions to his face)

out in public?

SEBASTIAN

Don't make a mountain out of molehill.

I didn't let anyone see me.

LINDA

That's not good enough. When you're

outside the lab there are a thousand

variables none of us can control. It's

just not safe for you to be out there.

SEBASTIAN

Come on, Linda. You don't expect me to

be some kind of prisoner.

LINDA

You volunteered for this, Sebastian.

You knew going in there could be

consequences.

(beat)

For the security of this project, I'm

gonna have to ask you to confine

yourself to the compound.

SEBASTIAN

I'm still Project Leader, Linda. It's

my decision to make.

LINDA

You're right. It's your decision. But

if you leave the compound again, I'll

notify the oversight committee. Then

they can make the decision. You

understand?

SEBASTIAN

Matt?

MATT

Sorry, man. You'd do the same if it

were the other way around.

LINDA

Pack 'em up... Everyone go home.

LINDA

Hold still.

SEBASTIAN

(contentious)

How much blood do you think you've

taken so far?

LINDA

Not enough to worry about.

SEBASTIAN

Every day... feels like you're sucking

me dry.

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

It's funny. All these years I've known

you, I never pegged you for a

megalomanic.

LINDA

What are you talking about?

SEBASTIAN

The shoe being on the other foot. You

getting to run things.

LINDA

I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when

a classified experiment disappears in

the middle of the night, someone's

gotta run the show.

(tries sympathy)

Look, I know how hard this has been

for you.

SEBASTIAN

Don't patronize me.

(beat)

And for the record, you've got no idea

what it's like. I get up every morning

and you people stick needles in me.

You bombard me with radiation until I

vomit. And then at six it's over for

you. You get to go home. But Sebastian

is still here. Sebastian can't leave,

or else. That's the worst part, you

know. Here I have this ... this GIFT

and I can't even use it.

LINDA

Now it's a gift?

SEBASTIAN

You're goddamn right it's a gift. And

if you weren't so goddamned short

sighted, I'd be out there right now

trying to master it.

LINDA

Where're you going?

SEBASTIAN

Looks like I'm going nowhere.

MATT

Come on, man. We've got a ton of tests

scheduled today.

SEBASTIAN

Do them yourself.

LINDA

Want to talk about it?

SEBASTIAN

No.

LINDA

"We are the hollow men, the stuffed

men, headpieces filled with straw."

SEBASTIAN

Funny, huh? I've become a literal

metaphor.

LINDA

I don't want to fight you. I just want

what's best for the program.

SEBASTIAN

I know. And you being right doesn't

make it any easier for me.

LINDA

You can be scared. That's okay.

SEBASTIAN

I'm not scared of being stuck this

way. With a little more make-up and

practice, I could...

(he motions to his face)

... pass. Y'know, get by in the world.

But the testing...

LINDA

You're talking like you've given up.

It's only been a few months.

SEBASTIAN

What if it's years? I don't know how

much more testing I can take.

MATT

60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ...

85 ...

SEBASTIAN

We've got it. We've got it.

MATT

93% ... 95%... 95%

LINDA

That's all we need.

SEBASTIAN

Come on, baby. Come on.

MATT

Full quantum cascade at 95%.

(beat)

I'm sorry.

SEBASTIAN

You're sorry? You're fucking sorry?

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

Six weeks of this shit and you're

sorry!

JANICE

I don't blame him.

LINDA

I'll go talk to him.

MATT

Leave him alone. He just needs to blow

off some steam.

FRANK (V.0.)

Yeah?

SEBASTIAN

I'm going to the lab.

FRANK (V.0.)

Don't you sleep?

SEBASTIAN

Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept.

FRANK

Okay. I'm here if you need me.

MATT

How'd it go?

FRANK

Quiet. He worked in the lab till about

10:30 and then went to sleep.

SEBASTIAN

Ah, my two favorite people. Good

morning.

LINDA

Good morning.

MATT

Why so cheery this morning?

SEBASTIAN

You know some days you just wake up

feeling the world is full of

potential. Like your eyes have been

opened.

MATT

I'm happy if I make it to my coffee

machine.

LINDA

I restructured the third genome on

your radiated protein strand. Thought

you might want to take look.

SEBASTIAN

Cook up a batch and let's see where we

go.

LINDA

I thought you'd want to take a look at

it.

SEBASTIAN

I trust you. Now if you'll excuse me,

I need to have my head examined.

LINDA

I'm telling you, I know him.

Something's going on.

MATT

Think he knows about us.

LINDA

If he knew about us, he'd be angry and

that wasn't angry.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

When you were a kid, you ever dream

about being invisible?

CARTER

Sure... all the time.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

What did you imagine you'd do?

CARTER

The usual.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

What's the usual?

CARTER

Hanging out in the girl's locker room.

Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Jimmy Margiani?

CARTER

School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am.

Back then, I was the size of a small

planet and made a rather large target.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Ever think up anything along the grand

scale?

CARTER

Sure. World domination. Manipulating

stock markets, consolidating a

political power base. But those are

more recent fantasies.

SEBASTIAN

And what if it weren't fantasy? What

if you were out there in the world and

could do whatever you wanted with no

consequences whatsoever. How far would

go? I mean... if it were real?

CARTER

I don't know, man. Out in the real

world... I mean, there's a

responsibility...

SEBASTIAN

Let's say you saw a woman with amazing

tits. Would you brush against them?

CARTER

Hell, I try and do that now.

SEBASTIAN

Human nature. So if you could get away

with more, would you do more?

CARTER

I read that in a survey at a major

university they asked college students

"Would you steal if you were

guaranteed to get away with it?" 82%

said yes.

SEBASTIAN

Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder

if the world's ready for what we're

doing.

CARTER

So, Doc what did you do?

SEBASTIAN

What do you mean?

CARTER

When you were out.

SEBASTIAN

I just walked around. Y'know.

CARTER

Aw, you just walked around? Come on.

There's more, right?

SEBASTIAN

Like what?

CARTER

Man, I'd be walking up to people

saying shit like "This is God, go,get

a haircut." Or hanging out in the

changing room at Victoria's Secret.

SEBASTIAN

Kind of sophomoric, don't you think.

Besides, it was late and I wasn't out

that long.

CARTER

Well, did you see anybody?

SEBASTIAN

There was this one girl.

CARTER

Yeah? And did you mess with her?

SEBASTIAN

Naw...

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

Well maybe a little.

(beat)

I tell you though, a man could get

used to it.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Goodnight.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you.

LINDA

It's fine. I just didn't know you were

there. Goodnight.

LINDA

What was it?

MATT

I don't know. I don't see anything.

MATT (cont'd)

It's like something hit it.

CARTER

Hello?

CARTER (cont'd)

No. No. He's here No, I'm staring at

him. He's right there in his room.

LINDA

Thanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye.

(hangs up phone)

Phew.

MATT

Relax... it's nothing. Where were we?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Be quiet!

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is

it who blinds me?" and Odysseus

replied "Nobody is my name". And the

Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody

is killing me. Nobody".

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

Nobody's gonna hurt you.

SARAH

You awake?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

I am now.

SARAH

Notice anything unusual last night.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

No. Why?

SARAH

Franklin Three. He's dead.

SEBASTIAN

What of?

SARAH

His neck was broken and his windpipe

collapsed.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

How'd that happen?

SARAH

I thought maybe you could tell me.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Sarah... You saying I had something to

do with it?

SARAH

He was alive last night when I left

and he was dead this morning. And you

were the only one down here.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

I was in my room all night.

CARTER

That's all twelve hours.

LINDA

He never left the room.

SARAH

A windpipe doesn't just suddenly

collapse. Someone or something killed

it.

MATT

You saw the tape. The man was in his

chamber.

SARAH

Then we have a problem, because I the

cage was locked from the outside. That

means it was opened, the dog was

killed and the cage was closed and

locked again. Only a human could do

that.

CARTER

Well, it wasn't me.

MATT

And it wasn't him.

LINDA

Are we sure?

SEBASTIAN

Any big plans for tonight?

LINDA

Quiet night at home. Maybe a book.

SEBASTIAN

Really? Whatever happened to that guy

your were seeing?

LINDA

He's still in the picture. Why?

SEBASTIAN

Being locked down here, I'm forced to

live vicariously. Someday you'll have

to tell me what he's like.

LINDA

Maybe someday I will. See you in the

morning.

SEBASTIAN

Au domain.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Hmmm.

LINDA

(to Marine Guard)

Forgot something.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

What the hell?

FRANK

Pretty clever really. All it does is

recycle the signal. He flips this

switch, it takes a snapshot and that's

all we see.

LINDA

Asshole.

JANICE

And you think he's violent?

SARAH

He killed a dog with his bare hands.

FRANK

Dogs aren't people. Are we in any

danger?

LINDA

Either way, we aren't equipped to

handle this. We have to inform the

committee.

JANICE

What if he doesn't come back?

LINDA

They'll go after him.

(beat)

Who has tonight's shift?

JANICE

I do.

LINDA

Pretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just

do what you're doing so he doesn't

become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll

go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot

the committee deal with it.

KRAMER

I'll call General Caster right now and

convene the oversight committee

tomorrow.

LINDA

Thank you, sir.

MATT

What do we do in the meantime?

KRAMER

Just sit tight and wait for my call.

MRS. KRAMER

What was that about?

KRAMER

Just a little trouble at work.

MRS. KRAMER

You coming up?

KRAMER

In a minute. I have to make a few

calls.

KRAMER (cont'd)

Hello? Hello?

KRAMER

Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

What? No good morning for me? Don't

you like me anymore?

LINDA

Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

That's okay. It's going to be busy

day.

LINDA

When did he say held call?

MATT

He's probably meeting with the

committee trying to figure out what to

do.

LINDA

I'm gonna call him.

LINDA (cont'd)

Yes, Dr. Kramer please. Excuse me?

(inhales sharply - surprised)

When? I'm so sorry.

MATT

What?

LINDA

He's dead. Drowned in his pool last

night.

LINDA (cont'd)

Yes, General Thompson please. Thank

you.

LINDA (cont'd)

Hello? Hello?

MATT

Let me see that.

MATT (cont'd)

Intercom's working, but there doesn't

seem to be an outside line.

LINDA

I'll be right back with help.

ELEVATOR (V.0.)

Authorization please.

LINDA

Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.

ELEVATOR (V.0.)

Authorization invalid. Request denied.

LINDA

That's a first.

ELEVATOR (V.0.)

Authorization please.

LINDA

Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.

ELEVATOR (V.0.)

Authorization invalid. Request denied.

MATT

Let me try mine.

ELEVATOR (V.0.)

Authorization please.

MATT

Kensington Two Romeo One Five Nine.

ELEVATOR (V.0.)

Authorization invalid. Request denied.

LINDA

Tell me this isn't happening.

LINDA

We've got a problem.

MATT

How long before anybody starts looking

for us?

LINDA

There's no set check in procedure. It

could be weeks.

LINDA (cont'd)

You think you can got in?

FRANK

Already in. It was only a second level

encryption.

JANICE

Some security system.

FRANK

Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm

just extraordinary.

FRANK (cont'd)

But apparently someone is more

extraordinary than me.

MATT

What is it?

FRANK

There's nothing wrong with the system.

Our codes have been removed.

MATT

Removed? By who?

FRANK

Here's a clue. Only one code remains.

LINDA

Whose?

FRANK

Dr. Sebastian Caine.

CARTER

He's not in there.

LINDA

Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us

where you are.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me

in.

LINDA

Sebastian... where are you?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)

You have no idea what it's like. The

power of it. The freedom. I can't let

that go.

LINDA

C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me.

Tell me where you are and we can talk

about it.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)

There's nothing to talk about. See ...

I've done things that can't be undone.

LINDA

Sebastian! Sebastian!

(beat)

I want search parties. Thermal goggles

and tranquilizers.

JANICE

Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

I'm here.

FRANK

Doctor Caine?

LINDA

Sebastian?

MATT

This is bad.

LINDA

There's something over there.

LINDA (cont'd)

Jesus. Oh my god.

MATT

What happened?

LINDA

She was strangled. Multiple blows to

her head.

LINDA (cont'd)

We got a big problem here.

LINDA (cont'd)

Get everybody to the conference room.

Now!

MATT

Intercom... the phone lines. They're

dead.

LINDA

Gimme that.

LINDA (cont'd)

It was just working.

MATT

What the fuck is going on here?

MATT

What?

LINDA

Shhh.

LINDA (cont'd)

Give me the visor.

LINDA (cont'd)

C'mon.

FRANK

Did you find him?

LINDA

Janice is dead.

LINDA

It's clear.

SARAH

The man has checked out of reality.

FRANK

What happened? I don't understand.

CARTER

Isn't it obvious? Right now, we're the

only ones who knows he exists. If he

gets rid of us, no one knows and he

becomes the most powerful man on

earth.

FRANK

But he's not a killer.

LINDA

He wasn't. He is now.

MATT

Can you fix the elevator? Restore our

codes?

FRANK

It'd take hours to crack the

encryptions.

MATT

Right now that sounds like good news.

CARTER

So what do we do until then. Sit

around waiting for him to kill us off?

LINDA

No. We find him, before he finds us.

CARTER

You sure this'll work.

LINDA

We designed it to help find the rats

we kept dropping in year one. They

were too small for thermal scans.

MATT

Systems hot. Activating motion

detectors.

LINDA

I've got movement in Corridor Six.

MATT

That's him.

MATT

Got 'em.

LINDA

(into walkie)

Check. Check.

LINDA (cont'd)

Be careful.

MATT

Just watch our backs. Hey Carter,

ready?

CARTER

Let's do it.

LINDA

(into Walkie)

Take a right at the next accessway.

He's working his way back to the

offices.

MATT

(Walkie - sotto)

If we split up, can we trap him on

corridor eight?

LINDA (V.0.)

If he keeps heading in that direction.

MATT

Going Thermal.

LINDA

I lost him. Matt, I lost him.

MATT

He probably just stopped moving.

CARTER

It's me.

MATT

Do you have anything?

CARTER

Nothing.

MATT

How did he get by us?

CARTER

He couldn't.

MATT

Sebastian! We're here to help.

Sebastian.

CARTER

There. Behind those pipes. He's not

moving.

CARTER (cont'd)

Doctor Caine?

(beat)

Can you hear me?

MATT

(into walkie)

We see him. But he's not responding.

The heat signature doesn't move.

MATT

C'mon... C'mon...

CARTER

Covered.

MATT

What the...

MATT (cont'd)

Just a vent. Just a goddamn vent

LINDA (V.0.)

He was there.

MATT

Looks like... looks like we're pumping

out heat...

LINDA (V.0.)

I got movement again! He's right on

top of you!

MATT

No fucking shit!

MATT (cont'd)

Sebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go.

CARTER

(choking)

H...Help... MMmmphg

MATT

(into walkie)

Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!?

LINDA

Right on top of you.

LINDA (V.0.)

What's going on? Are you okay?

MATT

Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from

a head wound.

LINDA

Matt, he's coming toward you.

MATT

Shit.

LINDA

Got outta there.

LINDA

He's close!

MATT

Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's

shutting me in.

MATT (cont'd)

Where is he?

LINDA

He's coming right at you!

MATT

Where?

LINDA

Twenty, maybe thirty feet.

MATT

Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the

place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must

be ghosts.

LINDA

Those signatures ... they're coming

from the heating vents.

MATT

I'm starting to lose resolution on my

thermals.

LINDA

Get out of there!

FRANK

If the room temperature is the same as

his body temperature, thermal

visors'll be no good.

LINDA

I'm going!

FRANK

Linda...it's not safe.

LINDA

That's why I'm going.

(to Frank and Sarah)

Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to

the lab. We'll meet you there.

FRANK

But...

LINDA

Do it.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo...

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

Not even close.

SEBASTIAN

So... just out of curiosity, how long

has my best friend been fucking my ex-

girlfriend.

MATT

Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You

aren't thinking rationally.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she?

MATT

Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk

this through. It's not too late.

MATT (CONT'D)

C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm

your friend.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

I'm sorry, but I just feel that our

friendship is holding me back. I'm

sure you understand.

SARAH

This way.

SARAH (cont'd)

Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow.

FRANK

He'll be okay.

SARAH

It's pretty severe. We have to get him

to the lab.

FRANK

He's got to be okay.

SARAH

For godsakes, help me.

MATT

He was going to kill me.

LINDA

I know. He's gone.

MATT

We've got to got out of here.

MATT (cont'd)

Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he?

LINDA

Habitats.

MATT

Oh god. That's right between us and

the lab.

SARAH

His pulse is faint.

SARAH (cont'd)

He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold

this.

SARAH (cont'd)

Keep applying pressure.

SARAH (cont'd)

Don't move your hand until I got back.

FRANK

Where are you going?

SARAH

This'll hold him but he needs blood.

FRANK

But...

SARAH

Supply is right down the hall. I'll be

two seconds.

FRANK

Sarah, wait for the others

SARAH

If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on

the wound.

MATT

Ahh!  Shit!

MATT (cont'd)

Karl Three. Nice shot.

LINDA

He's let the animals out. It wasn't

him we were tracking.

LINDA (cont'd)

You okay?

MATT

It won't kill me unless it gets

infected. You?

LINDA

Me .... Don't ask about me. If he

freed all the animals, we could have

dozens running around the lab.

MATT

So he could be anywhere right now.

MATT (cont'd)

What do we do?

LINDA

Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors

and pray to God Frank can reprogram

the elevator.

SARAH

Frank?

SARAH (cont'd)

(frightened whisper)

Who's there?

SARAH (cont'd)

Dr. Caine?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

You missed.

SARAH

Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me

go.

SARAH (cont'd)

What are you doing? No!

SARAH (cont'd)

Help me! Oh God. Somebody help me!

FRANK!

SARAH (cont'd)

No... please. Don't do this to me.

SARAH (cont'd)

What do you want?

SEBASTIAN

You.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

I've always liked your feistiness.

FRANK

Sarah! Sarah!

(to Carter)

Goddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you

let up... Sarah! Sarah!

FRANK (cont'd)

Sarah! I'm losing him.

FRANK (cont'd)

Did you see her?

LINDA

Where is she?

FRANK

She went to the supply room. Carter

needed blood.

LINDA

I said no one goes anywhere alone.

FRANK

She didn't listen.

FRANK (cont'd)

But...

LINDA

He's dead.

LINDA

Oh god. Sarah!

LINDA (cont'd)

No...

FRANK

Her too?

LINDA

This didn't happen. This hasn't

happened.

MATT

It happened alright. Now we have to

deal with it.

FRANK

Yeah? And just what are we supposed to

do now?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Now? Now you die.

LINDA

He's here!

MATT

Where?

LINDA

Sebastian!

LINDA (cont'd)

Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me.

LINDA (CONT1D)

I don't know if you can understand

this, but what you're experiencing is

a psychological breakdown. This isn't

who you are.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

I would say that what I am

experiencing is psychological

awareness. I like you being in

complete and absolute control.

LINDA

You goddamn bastard! You goddamn

bastard. You're gonna pay for this.

I'm going to bring you back to

visibility and then I'm going throw

your ass in jail.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

You're never gonna bring me back

Linda. I never want to come back.

LINDA

Fuck you!

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time

for old times sake.

MATT

Don't listen to him. It's not worth

it.

FRANK

Come on, Matt. Let's go get the

elevator back on-line so we can got

out of this hell hole.

MATT

He does anything, anything at all,

come get us. I'll be back to check on

you in five.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Imagine you two, carrying on right

under my nose. Out of curiosity, what

did he give you that I couldn't?

LINDA

Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man

than you'll ever be.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If

that's what you want...

LINDA

Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No...

LINDA (cont'd)

Matt! Frank!

LINDA (cont'd)

Matt! Matt! Frank!

LINDA

Jesus!

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

Figured it out? You were always so

clever.

LINDA

No!

LINDA (cont'd)

Hang on!

MATT

Get out of here!

LINDA

(yelling)

You won't get away with this. They'll

find out about you. They'll hunt you

down.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

The villagers with their torches? Lock

up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's

not gonna happen that way.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)

See, I've spent all my time down here

thinking up this plan. When they find

you, they'll find a pile of charred

corpses. The result of a terrible

accident, I'm afraid.

LINDA

How can you be so brutal?

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE

I guess because I don't have to look

at myself in the mirror anymore

(beat)

Remember that first night I was out? I

did something bad, just to see if I

could get away with it. And when I

did, I realized I could have it all. I

can kill in broad daylight. And

nobody's gonna tell the police they

were fucked by a ghost. Anything I

desire I can make happen, but not if

people know.

MATT

I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs.

LINDA

Just keep going. I'll fix you later.

LINDA

Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now.

MATT

He surprised us. We weren't

expecting...

LINDA

Shhh. Don't talk.

LINDA (cont'd)

We gotta move. Hang on.

MATT

Lin...

MATT (cont'd)

I can't feel anything.

LINDA

You feel that?

MATT

A little...

LINDA

Your losing blood, but he didn't hit

the vitals.

LINDA (cont'd)

Sutures and thread.

LINDA

Goddamnit.

MATT

What're you doing?

LINDA

This is temporary.

LINDA (cont'd)

You still with me?

MATT

Barely.

LINDA

Just keeps getting worse.

LINDA

Oh shit.

MATT

There's no way out.

LINDA

There's got to be.

MATT

They say freezing to death isn't so

bad. You just kinda pass out.

LINDA

Matt! MATT!

LINDA (cont'd)

We're not dying in here.

ELEVATOR

Authorization please?

SEBASTIAN

Caine. One One One One One.

ELEVATOR

Authorization valid. Thank you.

LINDA

Sebastian!

LINDA (cont'd)

I can't let you leave. Come on out and

I'll give you one last chance.

SEBASTIAN

You said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't

hold on to the past.

LINDA

Aaaaaaahhhh!

SEBASTIAN

Oh God!

LINDA

You wanna see God? I'll show you God.

SEBASTIAN

I'm gonna find everyone in your family

and kill them-. Your sister... she

never liked me. I think I'll go after

her and her little boy first.

SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

I just wanted you to know that before

you die.

MATT

Thought I'd... thought I'd save you

for a change.

MATT (cont'd)

Let's got out of here.

LINDA

Nitro...

MATT

He said it himself... All they'll find

is a pile of charred corpses.

LINDA

He's rigged the centrifuge.

MATT

In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out

the whole lab.

LINDA

Grab on.

MATT

Forget about me. You go.

LINDA

Fuck you. Give me your hands.

LINDA

Climb!

MATT

But...

LINDA

Climb!

MATT

I can't. I'm going to pass out.

LINDA

Keep moving.

LINDA

Oh God!

MATT

Don't look.

LINDA

Move!

MATT

It's coming down!

LINDA

C'mon. Before it slips.

LINDA (cont'd)

It's him.

MATT

Sebastian, you fuck.

LINDA

Get off me.

MATT

No!

LINDA

Let go of me.

SEBASTIAN

Remember the day we met? You were

wearing a red dress and you were so

pretty. Now... Now look at you.

MATT

Get off of her!

MATT (cont'd)

Sebastian, stop it.

SEBASTIAN

You fucked it all up.

LINDA

Go to hell.

MARINE GUARD

What happened?

LINDA

We lived.

FADE

OUT:
