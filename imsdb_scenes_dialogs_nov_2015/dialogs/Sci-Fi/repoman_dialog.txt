as a fry cook, man. You know I could

be manager in two years? King! God!

(egad!)

OTTO

You know Kevin, I had this wild fucking

(flippin) dream the other night.

KEVIN

I bet.

OTTO

It was with you and me and we were working

in this sleazy shithole (shabby) motel

down in Miami, Florida. And we were

bellhops and we were sixty-five years

old. It was so real it was really real,

realistic.

KEVIN

And then what, you woke up in a puddle

(cold sweat)?

OTTO

Fuck you! (drop dead)

KEVIN

Fucking (you) jerk.

KEVIN

Where you going asshole (snotnose)?

OTTO

Away from you.

NOTE

Edge City, also the name of the film's

production company, is a recurring theme

in Tom Wolfe's "Electric Kool-Ade Acid

Test".

OTTO

Mother, father. Got anything to eat?

REVEREND LARRY

Occasionally we get a letter from a

viewer that says now the only reason

Reverend Larry comes on your television

set is because he wants your money.

And do you know what? They're right!

I do want your money. Because god wants

your money. So I want you to go out

and mortgage that home and sell that

car and send me your money. You don't

need that car. (continues in background)

OTTO MOM

Put it on a plate son you'll enjoy it

more.

OTTO

I couldn't enjoy it any more mom MMM

MMM MMM This is swell.

OTTO

Dad? Hey Dad?

OTTO DAD

What is it son?

OTTO

Do you remember that you once told me

along time ago. Well not too long ago

but ummm. That you told me that you'd

give me a thousand dollars to go to

Europe if I finish school. Well you

know something? You were right. About

finishing school that's ah that's what

I'd like to do. But umm I want to know

if I could have the money first. Like

now. [You know I really love you Dad

I've always loved you. You too mom.

What do you say?

OTTO DAD

I don't have it anymore.

OTTO

What?]

OTTO MOM

You father gave all our extra money

to the Reverend's telethon, Otto.

OTTO

Well what about me?

OTTO DAD

You're on the honor roll of the chariots

of fire. Same as us, Otto. It was a

gift. From all of us jointly.

OTTO MOM

We're sending bibles to El Salvador.

OTTO

So how much do I get paid, twenty-five

buck a car.

BUD

Paid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding,

you work on commission, that's better

than getting paid.

BUD

Most cars you rip are worth two or three

hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar

Porsche (german pronounciation) might

make ya five grand.

BUD

It helps if you dress like a detective,

too. Detectives dress kind of square.

People think this guy is a cop. They're

going to think you're packing something.

They don't fuck (mess) with you so much.

OTTO

Are you?

BUD

Am I what?

OTTO

Packin' something.

BUD

Ha. Only an asshole (a jackass) gets

killed for a car. Guys who make it are

the guys who get into their cars at

anytime. Get in at three A.M. get up

at four. That's why there ain't a repo

man I know that don't take speed.

OTTO

Speed huh?

BUD

I'll call you back! (hangs up) Flippin

general telephone.

BUD

C'mon.

[BUD SNORTING A LINE

Jesus Christ.]

BUD

Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired

a car. Kid. I never broke into a trunk.

I shall not cause harm to any vehicle

nor the personal contents thereof. Nor

through inaction let that vehicle or

the personal contents thereof come to

harm. That's what I call the repo code

kid. Don't forget it etch it in your

brain. Not many people got a code to

live by anymore.

BUD

Hey! Hey look at that. Look at those

assholes (that) over there.

BUD

Ordinary  people I hate 'em.

OTTO

Me too.

BUD

What do you know? See an ordinary person

spend his life avoiding tense situations.

Repoman spends his life getting into

tense situations. ! Lets go get a drink.

BUD

Tense situations kid. Get into five

or six of them a day and it don't mean

shit (zilch) anymore. I mean I seen

men stabbed and it didn't mean shit

(zilch). I've seen guns. Guns too they

don't mean shit (zilch) but that's when

you got to watch your self. Here I'll

handle it pal. Uh settle down.

BUD

Have a nice day. Or night. Night, day,

it doesn't mean shit (zilch).

DUKE

Wasn't that Otto?

DEBBI

Otto who?

DUKE

You gotta watch yourself. (takes off

mask) Have a nice day . . . night.

BUD

This is what I call phase 2 ace. If

the dealer don't have the keys, you

call the truck. And it is a heartbreak

to be sitting waiting for the truck

and the giblet comes out and drives

it away. Once you've got this baby on

the hooks, she's all ours.

PAKMAN

Oh no you don't. I'm nipping this in

the bud right now. You are not going

to take this car. I know my rights.

There is absolutely no way you're going

to take it.

BUD

Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman?

PAKMAN

Obviously not. I'm Arthur Pakman. Luann

is my daughter. Now you're going to

have to take this matter up with her.

BUD

Well don't think I haven't tried, sir,

but she hasn't had the decency to call

us in months. I mean, I've skipped trace

this car all over town.

PAKMAN

Well, uh, Luann is sick. Now the damn

car isn't working anyway, and I know,

I know that's why she hasn't paid you.

BUD

Well, she could have called us? Look,

all you've go to do is call my branch

manager, I will abide with whatever

he says.

PAKMAN READING CARD

I. G. Farben. . . What do you take me

for, a moron? If I go in there, you're

going to take this car away.

BUD

What, and lose my job? The law requires

that I stay right here until you call

my branch manager.

PAKMAN

That's the law?

BUD

That's the law.

PAKMAN

I'll be right back.

BUD

There's going to be some bad shit (stuff)

coming down one of these days kid.

OTTO

Oh yeah? Where you going to be? On the

moon?

BUD

Ung Uh, I'm going to be right here heading

north at a hundred and ten per.

OTTO

OTTO

to be like this man. Cops and robbers.

Hahahahah. Real live car chases. Hahahahah.

ARCHIE

DUKE

all these people Archie.

ARCHIE

They all ran away.

DEBBI

Come on you douche bags. (come on, get

the lead out.)

BUD

Awful quiet in here. It's too quiet.

OTTO

So who are these Rodriguez boys.

BUD

Rodriguez brothers. Lagarto and Napoleon.

Two notorious delinquents currently

responsible for at least thirty vehicles

in the field.

OTTO

Scumbags

LITE

They ain't scumbags. They car thieves

just like use.

LITE

MS. MAGRUDER

OTTO

BUD

The fucking (flippin) millionaires.

They never pay their bills. See you

OTTO

Let me get this one.

BUD

No. I'll handle this one. Mister Peason

is carrying a permit for a pistol.

BUD

Hey! Hey! Hey! Give me that.

OTTO

Don't underestimate me ace.

RUTHSIDE PEASON

And also, naturally, I'd like them to

be right next to each other. In addition

I'd like them to be as close to the

window as possible so I can sit in my

car and watch my things. So all you

have to do is take your clothes out

of here like this and put them into

a machine over there like that.

RUTHSIDE PEASON

Oh my god (lord)! Oh! Oh my god (lord)!

Stop!

OTTO

Hey! Hey! You want a ride? Hey babe

They weren't in the middle of the street.

That not the middle of the street that's

OLD LADY

Go on you pick it up.

of four dead aliens.

OTTO

HAHAHAH

LEILA

Laugh away fuckface (fatface) that picture

is going to be on the cover of ever

major newspaper in two days time.

OTTO

How do you know that?

LEILA

Part of a secret network. A scientist

who is also in our secret sect smuggled

the corpses off of this air force base.

Now he's got them in the truck of his

car. It's a Chevy Malibu. We've got

to find him.

OTTO

What are you going to do with them,

LEILA

Yes! We're going to have a press conference

and tell the world.

RADIO

seem to have any. Oh yes let's. But

Many of them do seem furry and adorable,

but beware we don't know from whence

they came. Be safe. Be safe. Report

in background)

busy with work, the Malibu and everything.

OTTO

Hey great. Terrific. Here's your shit

LEILA

What's your problem? I mean girls might

like you if you lightened up a little

bit.

OTTO

Fuck (Flip me). Girls pay to go out

with me. All right?

LEILA

You wanna get back in the car?

OTTO

What, here?

LEILA

Yeah.

OLY

Twenty thousand dollars for a Chevy

Malibu?

OLY

Who's double X finance?

MARLENE

Store front operation, but the money

is in escrow.

MARLENE

Want me to notify the boys?

OLY

Uh, naw. They're always bitching (crying)

about their case load. I think I'll

go out for a while.

MARLENE

Why? We out of beer?

OLY

Somebody has to work around here. Keep

making me money kid.

OTTO

Fuck (flip) you.

LITE

Man we've been looking for this little

red devil for a long time. Just act

natural. Nobody knows if its your car

or somebody elses car.

LITE

Now you work with that. You give it

a try. All right?

LITE

Let me give you a hand we dont have

a whole year to find it boy.

OTTO

Got it.

LITE

Lets get out of here. Put your seat

belt on.

LITE

Put your seat belt on boy! I don't ride

with anybody unless they wear their

seatbelt. It's one of my rules.

LITE

Put that damn gun down boy. It ain't

no toy.

LITE

I walk into someone's place of work.

They shit (plum) scared. They know I'm

not a cop. They think I've come to kill

'em and I would. I'd kill anybody who

crosses me. You know what I mean?

LITE

Do you like music?

OTTO

Sure.

LITE

In that case you're going love this.

LITE

I was into these dudes before anybody.

Partied with them all the time. Asked

me to be their manager. I called bullshit

(no way) on that. Managing a pop group

hey that ain't no job for no man.

LITE

You read that book I gave you?

OTTO

What book?

LITE

Dioretix. Science of matter over mind.

OTTO

Unh uhg

LITE

You'd better read it and quick. That

book will change your life. Found it

in a Maseratti in Beverly hills.

MILLER

A lot of people don't realize what's

really going on. They view life as a

bunch of unconnected incidences and

things. They don't realize that there's

this like lattice of coincidence that

lays on top of everything. I'll Give

you an example, show you what I mean.

Suppose you thinking about a plate of

shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like

plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out

of the blue no explanation. No point

in looking for one either. It's all

part of a cosmic unconsciousness.

OTTO

You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in

the hippie days?

MILLER

I'll give you another instance. You

know the way everybody's into weirdness

right now. Books in all the supermarkets

about Bermuda triangles, UFO's, how

the Mayans invented television. That

kind of thing.

OTTO

I don't read them books.

MILLER

Well the way I see it it's exactly the

same. There ain't no difference between

a flying saucer and a time machine.

People get so hung up on specifics.

They miss out on seeing the whole thing.

Take South America for example. In South

America thousands of people go missing

every year. Nobody knows where they

go. They just like disappear. But if

you think about it for a minute, you

realize something. There had to be a

time when there was no people. Right?

OTTO

Yeah. I guess.

MILLER

Well where did all these people come

from? hmmm? I'll tell you where. The

future. Where did all these people disappear

to? hmmm?

OTTO

The past?

MILLER

That's right and how did they get there?

OTTO

How the fuck (hell) do I know?

MILLER

Flying saucers. Which are really? Yeah

you got it. Time machines. I think a

lot about this kind of stuff. I do my

best thinking on the bus. That how come

I don't drive, see?

OTTO

You don't even know how to drive.

MILLER

I don't want to know how. I don't want

to learn. See? The more you drive, the

less intelligent you are.

BUD

You know I think I saw one of those

things once. One of those UFOs. I mean

it was really it was kind of kind of

scary. I saw all these colored lights

and, uh, sounds. I mean sounds and lights

like I never heard before. I mean it

was really weird.

OTTO

Bud.

BUD

Yeah?

OTTO

Do you think all repo men follow the

code?

BUD

Of course. Well I mean you see a lot

of fucked (messed) up cars come in but...99

time out of 100 it was the customer

who fucked (mucked) them up. Assholes

(Damn fools).

BUD

I'm offering a thousands dollars for

his Falcon. You know what that is Napoleon?

It's a bribe.

NAPOLEON

Who the hell is this? Napoleon? Who

the fuck (hell) are you calling?

BUD

It's a grand if you show me where his

car is Napoleon.

[NAPOLEON

Ahh. Go fuck yourself asshole.]

BUD

Hello? Prick (Jerk).

NAPOLEON

Sixty-four Chevy Malibu. Twenty grand.

BUD

Waiting!

NAPOLEON

We could buy ten of them for that, Marlene.

MARLENE

Think you can find it now?

BUD IN THE STREET

I'm not going anywhere.

NAPOLEON

Now how come this junk is worth so much?

What's in it? Drugs?

BUD IN THE STREET

Got all night amigo!

LAGARTO

Los Hermanos Rodriguez don't approve

of drugs.

MARLENE

Neither do I, but it's my birthday.

BUD IN THE STREET

I'm going to get your .

[MARLENE

That motherfucker's still down there.]

BUD

Don't care how long it takes, dildos

(jerks). Repo man's got all night every

night.

BUD

twenty thousand dollars.

OTTO

Hey Leila! All right, um, this is Otto.

The guy who gave you a ride and stuff.

I heard something about that car.

LEILA

Otto. Otto stop. You said you had something

to tell me.

LEILA

Otto? Otto!

OTTO

Huh?

LEILA

What did you want to tell me?

OTTO

Oh! Take off your clothes.

LEILA

I'm at work, Otto!

OTTO

Oh yeah? Me too.

LEILA

Your work is different than mine.

OTTO

Says who?

LEILA

What are you doing.? Don't do that.

[OTTO

Well the least you could do is give

me a blow job.

OTTO

Heh, I guess that means no.]

DEADRA

Leila? We have a cell meeting in two

minutes time.

LEILA

Thanks Deadra. I'll be right there.

BUD

See that motherfucker (melonfarmer)

only thinks I don't know what's going

on, Lite. As soon as I find that Chevy

I'm going indy. I'm going to buy myself

a tow truck, a couple of pitbulls, and

run a yard. Sit around and watch everybody

else do the work for a while (change).

LITE

No way you can do that on twenty grand

man.

BUD

The hell I can as long as you have good

credit and my credit is spotless.

The hell I can't, as long as your credit

record's good and mine is spotless.)

LITE

If I find the Malibu, you won't see

me for dust, I'm going to move to Mendecino

County, raise me a bumper crop of tomato

plants.

BUD

Credit is a sacred trust. It's what

our free society is founded on. You

think they give a damn about their bills

in Russia? I said do you think they

give a damn about their bills in Russia?

OTTO

They don't pay bills in Russia. It's

all free.

BUD

All free? Free my ass, what are you

a fucking (flippin) commie? Huh?

OTTO

No I ain't no commie.

BUD

Well you'd better not be I don't want

any commies in my car. No Christians

either.

KEVIN

I'll deal with you later. I've got a

customer to attend to. You too.

KEVIN

Hi! I'm Kevin. Vacuum sir?

KEVIN

Need a vacuum sir?

J. FRANK PARNELL

Have you any machines?

KEVIN

You don't want to eat from a machine.

Look, there's a nice Del Taco across

the street. They've got enchurritos

and everything.

J. FRANK PARNELL

But I do want to eat from a machine.

Vended food contains all the necessary

nutrients for survival. Taste damn good

too, by golly. And plus, on any given

evening, the machine that last night

gave you cheetos might dispense instead...

Doritos. Yohos. Oreos. Tosquitos (tostitos?).

Or Lorna Doones.

KEVIN

Lorna Doones? I love Lorna Doones.

KEVIN

Oh hey! You want me to check the trunk?

Scuze me.

KEVIN

Hi! I'm Kevin!

NAPOLEON

Hey buddy! How you doing? Huh? Hey don't

you remember me? I was here yesterday.

Heh. Listen I think I left a book of

matches over in your office over there.

You want to go and check for me huh?

KEVIN

Sure thing.

NAPOLEON

Hey thanks a lot buddy.

KEVIN

Any thing for you babes.

NAPOLEON

All right, you're beautiful. I love

you.

KEVIN

I'll be right back.

KEVIN

OTTO

It's really very simple Mrs. Parks.

You don't want me to take your car and

I don't want to take your car. Now I

said to the boss I said ah Look! I do

not want to repossess this ladys car.

MRS. PARKS

Well I've been in the hospital you see.

OTTO

Yeah, Yes I understand. My job is really

on the line over this one. I could lose

it right away.

MRS. PARKS

I'll see if I can borrow some money

from somewhere.

OTTO

That's terrific. Really terrific.

MRS. PARKS

Oh how was the rehearsal son?

MRS. PARKS' SON

MRS. PARKS

Oh this is Mr. Otto. He's from the finance

company. He's been telling me that he

isn't going to take the car this time,

even though he could.

OTTO

Well, uh, gotta get going here.

MRS. PARKS

Did you like the tea?

OTTO

The tea?

MRS. PARKS

Uh huh?

OTTO

Yeah, it was terrific.

OTTO

Thank you

MRS. PARKS

You're welcome.

OTTO

Uh excuse me.

MRS. PARKS

it and you didn't do it. What did you

do with it? I'm so tired of giving you

money and you squandering it. I know

OTTO

for Christ's sake. Answer me!

AGENT

(heard in background) I'm picking up

the dead. I'm putting my hands around

this dead body. I'm, I'm carrying his

limp torso to the truck. And he feels

like like he has only been dead a little

while but...

J. FRANK PARNELL

(holds out hand) J. Frank Parnell.

OTTO

ott, ott...

J. FRANK PARNELL

What line of work you in?

OTTO

re, re, re..

J. FRANK PARNELL

Rock'n'roller, eh!? I used to be a musician

myself, college days. Of course it was

folk songs and protest songs back then.

(begins singing, badly) We shall overcome,

we shall overcome...

J. FRANK PARNELL

(stops singing and scratches ear) Did

you ever feel as if your mind had started

to erode?

OTTO

No.

J. FRANK PARNELL

Ever been to Utah?

OTTO

Nuh-uh

J. FRANK PARNELL

I go to Utah every year. Friend of mine,

was a designer of the MX missile race

track basing mode. A hundred thousand

miles of railroad track on a big loop

through Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Bombs

were going to hide in locomotive sheds.

That way the red team would never know

exactly where they were. I still go

out to Utah, just to think about the

way things might have been.

OTTO

Sir. I represent the Helping Hand Acceptance

Corporation.

J. FRANK PARNELL

Radiation, yes indeed! You hear the

most outrageous lies about it. Half-baked

goggle-boxed do-gooders telling everybody

its bad for you. Pernicious nonsense!

Everybody could stand a hundred chest

X-rays a year. They ought to have 'em

too. When they canceled the project

it almost did me in. One day my mind

was literally a-burst. The next day

nothing. Swept away... But I showed

them. I had a lobotomy in the end.

OTTO

Lobotomy? Isn't that for loonies?

J. FRANK PARNELL

Not at all. A friend of mine had one.

Designer of the neutron bomb. Ever hear

of the neutron bomb? Destroys people.

Leaves buildings standing. It fits in

a suit case. It's so small no one knows

it's there until blammo. Eyes melt skin

explodes everybody dead. It's so immoral

working on the thing can drive you mad.

That's what happened to this friend

of mine. So he had a lobotomy. Now he's

well again.

OTTO

What kind of car does your... does your

friend drive?

J. FRANK PARNELL

Chevy Malibu.

OTTO

And you do the same type of work?

J. FRANK PARNELL

Didn't I tell you? I can't tell you

what I do. I'm classified.

OTTO

This is really a nice old car. Why don't

you let me drive?

J. FRANK PARNELL

What do you mean?

OTTO

Well I don't know. I mean...uh! Don't

you feel funny.?

J. FRANK PARNELL

Why should I feel funny? The two hemispheres

are fundamentally at odds. Hemisphere,

Hemisphere. You know it's strange. I

do feel funny...

OLY

By the way kid, sign this.

OTTO

What is this?

OLY

Equity turnover. Standard practice.

Protects you in case we get sued. .

BUD

Melonfarmer Oly! ...oooh, shoot.

OTTO

BUD

popcorn)

DUKE

OTTO

Yeah I'm here man.

DUKE

The lights are growing dim. I know a

life of crime led me to this sorry fate.

And yet I I blame society. Society made

me what I am.

white suburban punk, just like me.

DUKE

But it still hurts.

a chicken man?

OTTO

What?

PLETTSCHNER

A chicken man. Did you ever see a farmer's

wife? Huh?

OTTO

Let go of me!

[PLETTSCHNER

It's peaceful man.]

AGENT 1

The Malibu.

AGENT 2

Yeah?

MARLENE

Let's go

OTTO

No way Marlene.

OTTO

My car's gone and we're going to get

to the bottom of this.

MARLENE

Like hell we are.

AGENT 2

Not in my face.

PLETTSCHNER

Hold it Marlene. Freeze!

AGENT 2

My Face!

MARLENE

Over my dead body.

PLETTSCHNER

That's how it's going to have to be.

MARLENE

Come and get me. Come on.

PLETTSCHNER

I've been wanting to do that one for

a long time honey.

MARLENE

Come on. Come on. Come on if you think

your man enough.

OTTO

Hey Fletch. Coffee break.

AGENT ROGERSZ

Good evening Otto. This is agent Rogersz.

I'm going to ask you a few questions.

And since time is short and you may

lie, I'm going to have to torture you.

But I want you to know it isn't personal.

OTTO

Look Ah this isn't really necessary.

I'll tell you anything you want to know.

AGENT ROGERSZ

Good! Where is the Malibu?

OTTO

I don't know. Somebody ripped it from

the yard.

LEILA

I don't think he knows.

AGENT ROGERSZ

Increase the voltage.

LEILA

But what if he's innocent?

AGENT ROGERSZ

No one is innocent. Proceed.

AGENT ROGERSZ

Ah yes! Look at them. High heels, hair

nets, those ridiculous trench coats.

They're pathetic.

AGENT 1

But agent Rogersz, they're getting away.

AGENT ROGERSZ

That's all part of the plan.

MARLENE

Otto, Otto pull your self together.

OTTO

Marlene? What's going on?

MARLENE

We're going to the hospital.

OLD LADY

Hey, I know you. You're the one that

run into my trash.

OTTO

Shh!

OLD LADY

Shhh to you too.

LAGARTO

Out of order. Take the stairs.

NOTE

Dr. Benway and Mr. Lee are both characters

from "The Naked Lunch"

KEVIN

Otto?

NURSE 1

Let me see that. All wrong do it over.

OLD LADY

They're going through it all the and

they won't pick it up.

NURSE 2

Oh well isn't that a shame.

OLD LADY

Oh tell you it comes to something when

they expect you to pick it up.

OTTO

How are you doing man?

MARLENE

Ask him about the Malibu.

OTTO

Look about the other night. I'm sorry

I split. I know I should have stayed

with you but ah it's like when I was

a kid you know I I had this set of big

wheels you know.

MARLENE

Otto!

BUD

Shit (shoot). (starts to get up off

of the bed)

REVEREND LARRY

Praise the lord.

NAPOLEON

Go. Go. Go.

NAPOLEON

Come on. Let's go.

OTTO

Dude slow down.

NAPOLEON

AGENTS

Chicken shits (stuff). braak-braak-braak

AGENT ROGERSZ

Where's the Malibu?

OTTO

Don't even ask because I don't know.

I mean I don't have it Marlene doesn't

have it you and your crazy friends don't

have it. So that only leaves...

AGENT

Where is he.

AGENT

Where the fuck (hell) is he.

NAPOLEON

Later!

MARLENE

Bye, Bye.

VOICE FROM THE RADIO

Here's another weird one. Reports are

coming in about apparent hail of ice

cubes south of downtown. Scientist are

at a loss to explain the freak showers

of tiny cubes of ice.

OTTO

That's some weird fucking shit (filthy

stuff) Eh Bud? What's going on man?

BUD

Shit (damn)! Eleven years of repoing

cars and what have I got? Shit (zilch)!

OTTO

Bud listen to me. You're sitting in

a car worth twenty thousand dollars.

Look look we we turn it in we take the

money and split it sixty forty. You

and me.
