Ken Finkleman

SECOND DRAFT

February 18, 1982

P.A.

All lunar departures, please proceed to

concourse lounge 'B.'

P.A.

Attention, all Pulsar Four mining

personnel.

P.A.

Please report to the Resource Expeditions

office, level seven.

OLDER NUN

No tongues, Father.

GUIDE

All lunar shuttle landings are handled by

these computers and simulated on these

video units.

CONTROLLER 1

(at computer screen)

You're programmed on R-two-niner and

locked, Lunar eight six.  Over.

CAPTAIN

(to co-pilot)

It's out of our hands now, gentlemen.

KRUGER

Commissioner, we both know the Mercury

shuttle needs another month of pre-launch

testing.

COMMISSIONER

Forget it.  The boys on the board want

that shuttle to go on schedule.

CUT TO:

KRUGER

And what do the boys on the board know

about safety, Commissioner?  Let me talk

to them.

COMMISSIONER

Bud, get wise to the political realities.

The boys on the board are under a lot of

pressure from the boys downtown.

CUT TO:

KRUGER

And I'll be the one they'll hang if

there's a screw-up.

CUT TO:

COMMISSIONER

Listen, Bud, the boys downtown are under

heavy fire from the boys in Washington.

That's why they're putting pressure on the

boys on the board.

CUT TO:

KRUGER

Well, you tell the boys on the board to

tell the boys downtown to let the boys in

Washington know that the press has been

nosing around my people in the front

office.

CUT TO:

COMMISSIONER

You handle your front office people, I'll

handle the press and leave the boys in

Washington to the boys downtown and the

boys downtown to the boys on the board.

KRUGER

Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER

What?

KRUGER

I just wish it was that simple.

CONTROLLER

(over P.A.)

This is Mercury One control.  We have

condition green.  Mark launch 'T' minus

two hours and counting.  I repeat, we have

condition green.

RUMACK

This condition isn't as bad as it could be

if it were a lot worse.  Take these pills.

(hands him pills and water)

Here's some water.

CONTROLLER

What is it, doctor?

RUMACK

Two parts oxygen, one part hydrogen.

It'll make the pills go down easier.

WORKER

(into walkie-talkie)

This is Mercury station six!  Get me the

Sarg and fast!

BUSINESSMAN

Would you like to buy a rose to help bail

out Chrysler?  We're an all-profit

organization and need all the money we can

get.

SIMON

(to Businessman)

Here.

BUSINESSMEN

(to Hari Krishna)

IACCOCA, IACCOCA, IACCOCA, IARAMA.

SIMON

For the best little computer officer on

the Mercury mission.

ELAINE

(smiling)

Simon.

SIMON

Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was

once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago

run.

ELAINE

And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged

to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very

lucky woman.

SIMON

Women and the space program have come a

long way, sweetheart.  But after the

wedding, no more complicated computers for

my little girl.

ELAINE

But, darling, they've offered me a chance

to head up the computer analysis division

for the Jupiter probe.

SIMON

You're heading up the division in charge

of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.

SIMON

And that's an order, Lieutenant.

SARG

(on car phone)

Marge, you better go without me.  We've

got a condition red.

MARGE

(in evening gown, a cigar stuck

in her mouth)

We've got a condition red with our

marriage.  I think you're in love with

that shuttle, not with me.  I want a

divorce, Sarg.

SARG

Is there someone else, Marge?  Is that it?

MARGE

Sarg, there's been someone else for

fifteen years.  You were just too involved

in your work to see it.

SARG

Don't wait up for me, sweetheart.  We're

testing the retro-rockets tonight.

MARGE

You just can't see it, can you, Sarg.

SARG

We'll talk tomorrow, hon.  I promise.

P.A.

All Mercury passengers please proceed to

passenger processing, concourse level 'C.'

JOHN

That's us.

JIMMY

Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?

JOHN

We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty

long trip to Mercury.

PORTER

Can I help you folks?

JOHN

(handing him a bag)

Thanks.

PORTER

(noticing Scraps)

Is that your puppy, son?

JIMMY

Yeah, his name is Scraps and he's going to

Mercury with us.

PORTER

No dogs are allowed on the shuttle, son.

JIMMY

But they said...

PORTER

(pulling out a handgun)

Scraps will have to be shot.  I can do it

for you here if you like.

JIMMY

Scraps!!!

PORTER

(laughing)

Just joking.  Blanks.  See, Scraps is

fine.

ALICE

It was just a joke, Jimmy.

MAN WITH CAGE

(to Man in Cage)

If we can't fit you under the seat, you'll

just have to be locked up with the

luggage.

SARG

There's no way this wiring could have

passed inspection without Simon Kurtz's

okay!

KRUGER

(on phone)

Just patch up the damage and get that ship

ready to fly.  That's an order, mister!

SARG

You've got it, mister.  But you can tell

your boys on the board for me that this

thing stinks to high heaven of kickback.

WIPE TO:

KRUGER

You heard it, boys.  Now, what do you say?

ALL BOYS

Fuck him!

SARG

(to worker)

Ted Striker was right six months ago when

he test-piloted this sucker.  And what did

he get for telling the truth?  A one-way

ticket to Palukaville.

TED (V.O.)

(to self)

Who could have figured it would come to

this.  It'll be twenty years this week

that I lost my entire squadron over Macho

Grande.  Planes, too.

VOICE

You're too low, Striker!  You're too low!

TED (V.O.)

After the war, I couldn't go near anything

with a pair of wings.

TED (V.O.)

That is, until fate dropped me on the seat

of my pants at the stick of a 167 into

Chicago with no crew.

TED (V.O.)

It's funny how fate can make heroes out of

cowards.

TED (V.O.)

Then came the job offers.

TED (V.O.)

The publicity.

TED (V.O.)

Even the key to the City of New York.

TED (V.O.)

Now look at me.

BOY

Senor Ted!

cocaine.

SOLDIER

(to first peasant)

Traficante de drugas o communista?

PEASANT

(pleading)

Traficante de drugas, traficante de

drugas!

SOLDIER

(to second peasant)

Traficante de drugas o communista?

SOLDIER

Communista!

YOUNG MAN

(to Desk Clerk)

We've lost all our travelers' checks!

YOUNG WOMAN

What are we going to do?!

CLERK

Calm down.  What kind were they?

YOUNG MAN

American Excess!

CLERK

I'd say you're fucked.

TED

(to self)

Next thing I know, I'm the chief test

pilot for the XR-2300, NASA's first

Mercury shuttle.  That is, until I report

she's got more flaws than the Titanic.

TED

Now I'm testing old F-l8s for some crazy

Generalissimo who thinks there's a commie

behind every tree in the Amazon.

BOY

Senor Ted!  Look!

TED

My God!  They're launching the ZR-2300.

Do you know what that is, Jose?

BOY

The muffler bracket for a '78 Pinto.

TED

No, that's an XR-2200.  The XR-2300 is the

Mercury shuttle.  They can't do it!

TED

Taxi!

TED

Houston, Texas.

DRIVER

Houston, Texas, senor??

TED

Right at the corner, left at the light.

Here's a map and step on it!

SON

We finally made it, Ma.  Mercury.  We're

gonna start all over agin.  A whole new

life.

SON

Where the soil is rich.

SON

And the union strong.  Where men are free

to realize their true potential.

PORTER

Can I help you?

SON

Where black men and white men, working

together, can move mountains.

DRIVER

That'll be eight hundred and seventy-four

zillion quastavitas.

TED

Here's three bucks.  Keep the change.

DRIVER

Thank you!!

PORTER

You folks need any help?

STELLA

Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on

Thursdays.

PORTER

Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world-

renowned agronomist?

STELLA

Yes.

PORTER

It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm

familiar with all your work.

STELLA

Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.

(to Porter)

He was never appreciated at the Institute.

PORTER

Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with

it.

STELLA

Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be

buried on Mercury.

PORTER 2

Say, wasn't that Dr. Barrington, the

world-renowned agronomist?

PORTER 1

That's right.  Are you familiar with his

work?

PORTER 2

No, but the missus sure is.

TED

(to self)

I have to stop that flight.

BUSINESSMAN 1

Don't worry about the Viatex account.

It's a buy-sell option.  We can't get hurt

in either case.

BUSINESSMAN 2

Just keep on top of their legal people,

Bob.

BUSINESSMAN 1

Don't sweat it.

AGENT

(to traveller)

We can take your in-flight dinner orders

here, if you like.  Today there's lobster

or rack of lamb.

TRAVELLER

The lobster sounds nice.

TED

(rushing up)

Where can I find mission control?

AGENT

(without pointing or indicating

in any way)

Information's over there.

TED

Thanks.

AGENT

(to traveller in rags)

Today there's the swill or the slop.

TRAVELLER

The slop sounds nice.

MAN

(to Info Agent)

What's the fastest animal on earth?

INFO AGENT

The cheetah.  Next.

WOMAN

Should I fake my orgasms?

INFO AGENT

Yes.  Next.

"TERRORIST" 1

Please, where is flight to Miami?

INFO AGENT

(without indicating anything)

Over there.  Next.

TED

Mission control?

INFO AGENT

(without indicating anything)

It's over therrrrrrr!

ZOOM TO:

TED

That's strange.  I just came from over

there.

FRANK

I'll meet you on board.  I've got some

business to attend to.

SIMON

(to Elaine)

Frank's the best pilot in the program.

ELAINE

I'm so excited, Simon.

SIMON

I guess this is a first for you.

ELAINE

No, I've been excited before.

TED (O.S.)

Elaine.

ELAINE

(turning around)

Te...!

TED

That's not important now, Elaine.  We have

to talk.

ELAINE

Ted, we've been worried sick ever since

you escaped from the Ronald Reagan

Institute For The Mentally Feeble.

TED

Are you on the Mercury mission?

SIMON

That's right, Striker.  And we're getting

married when we return.

TED

It's got to be stopped!

ELAINE

But, Ted, the invitations have already

gone out.

TED

I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe

and, Kurtz, you know why.

SIMON

You're still crazy, Striker.  Come on,

sweetheart.

ELAINE

What did Ted mean?

SIMON

Elaine, he's still sick.

DISSOLVE TO:

SIMON

You're seeing bugs where they don't exist,

Striker.

TED

(holding wire)

Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out

under high temperatures.

SIMON

You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That

wiring meets all the safety

specifications.

TED

I know you've been subtly spreading the

word that I'm having a breakdown.

NEWSIE

Shuttle test pilot goes mad!

JACOBS

Sir, these are the designs for the flight

uniforms.  I think the captain's is to

die.

SIMON

(with drawings)

Good, good, no, no, good.  What's this?!

I said no studded dog collars, Jacobs.

TED

You won't get away with this, Simon!

ELAINE

Ted, what's wrong?

TED

(pulling away from her)

Ask Simon.

ELAINE

Ted, you're overworked.  You've been

flying yourself into the ground.

TED

There's nothing wrong with me!

ELAINE

Let's relax tonight, just the two of us.

I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the

way you like it, with spaghetti.

TED

You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!

(ranting)

It's all here in the design

specifications!

(grabs plans from a passing

technician)

Look!  It's all here!

ELAINE

No!  Wait!  You're hurting him!

SIMON

Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a

threat to this mission and his behavior

does absolutely nothing to promote peace

in the Middle East.

ELAINE

(crying on Simon's shoulder)

Simon, why has he become so... so...

SIMON

So mentally ill?

DISSOLVE BACK TO:

TED

(to self)

I'm perfectly sane.

STELLA

Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you

talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I

be of some help?

TED

Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.

STELLA

You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse.

This is my father, Dr. Barrington.

TED

Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned

agronomist?

STELLA

Yes.  He's dying a-n-d wants to be buried

on Mercury.

TED

I'm familiar with your work, Doctor.

You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.

STELLA

You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a

nurse.  I understand.

SIMON

Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to

pick up a few things at the drugstore.

ELAINE

(checking her watch)

Don't be too long.

DRUGGIST

Uppers, downers, coke, speed, hash,

Tampax.

TED

Elaine.

ELAINE

Ted, please.  You're just making things

difficult for yourself.

TED

Elaine, what happened to us?

ELAINE

Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you.

But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a

good provider.  I want that at this stage

of the game, Ted.  He might have his

faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning

of the word fear and I need that in a man.

SIMON

(looking at the label, "ANTI-

FEAR PILLS")

What does this word mean?

DRUGGIST

(looking at label)

'Fear,' to be afraid or over-anxious.

TED

Elaine, someone has to listen to me.  I'm

going right to mission control.

ELAINE

Ted, you should go right back to the

hospital.

DISSOLVE TO:

NURSE

That's $38.

ELAINE

Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you

feel a lot better.

ELAINE

Who's that, Ted?

TED

Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car

accident.  He hasn't been the same since.

TED

Elaine, when are you going to realize

Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out

of the way.

ELAINE

And when are you going to realize, Ted,

that your mental hygiene is the most

important thing right now.

VOICE (O.S.)

(ranting)

It works... No, it doesn't... Yes, it

does.

ELAINE

What's his problem?

MAN

It does work... No, it doesn't.

TED

His name's David Stockman.  He's been here

twenty years, that's all he says.

ELAINE

Ted, you must remember what the doctor

said, the first step on the road to sanity

is admitting that you're sick.  Now take

your electro-shock and you'll be back at

the space center in no time.  And by the

way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.

ELAINE

I just can't go on living with a man who

refuses to deal with reality, Ted.  I have

to go now.  Believe me, it's best for all

concerned.

TED

No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.

ELAINE

If that's the way you want it.

TED

That's the way I want it.  Just turn the

radio on and go.

ELAINE

Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.

DISSOLVE BACK TO:

FRANK

Carol's not going to give me a divorce

that easily, Jane.

JANE

I'm worried about her, Frank.  She could

do something senseless, something violent.

FRANK

You're the one who's not making sense,

Jane.  Carol's not the violent...

FRANK

Carol!

FRANK

No!  This is senseless!

MRS. GOOCH

Young man, would you have change for a

twenty?

TED

(going for his wallet)

I might have two tens.

MRS. GOOCH

Thank you anyway, but I wanted it in

quarters.

SERGEANT

(lookind down at Detective)

When is this senseless killing going to

stop?

DETECTIVE HALLICK

Senseless or not, Sergeant, there's a

pattern here.  This is the 12th victim

this week with a chalk mark around the

body.  I want this whole area cordoned

off!  I want everyone in this terminal

booked and beaten until they talk.  I want

an M.O. on everyone who has seen THE SOUND

OF MUSIC and I want the entire population

of Hawaii off that rock and into the water

within one hour.

DETECTIVE HALLICK

Sergeant.  I said cordon off, not

accordian off!  Now dust this area for

prints.

DETECTIVE HALLICK

And run a check on their plates.

DETECTIVE HALLICK

(TO CAMERA)

When will this senseless killing end?

PHOTOGRAPHER

Super!  Great!  Super!  Terrific!  Super!

KRUGER

That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly

murdered just minutes ago.

COMMISSIONER

That just doesn't make any sense.

KRUGER

I wonder how your boys in Washington are

going to take this one.

COMMISSIONER

I told you, leave the boys in Washington

to the boys downtown and the boys down...

KRUGER

You've made your point, Commissioner.

There's only one other pilot who can

handle that shuttle and that's Clarence

Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I

want him pulled.

(to Jacobs)

Jacobs, pull Oveur!

JACOBS

Not in your size, but I have a cardigan.

COMMISSIONER

I'll trust you on this, Bud, but I'm a

little nervous about Oveur's record.

SIMON

Captain Oveur?

OVEUR

Mr. Kurtz, I presume.

SIMON

We don't have much time.  Let's move.

I'll explain everything.

HAIR KRISHNA

Chanting or non-chanting?

CONTROLLER 1

This is Mercury launch control at "T"

minus fifty-eight minutes and counting.

All systems are go.  Clear launch area.

CONTROLLER 1 (V.O.)

(on P.A.)

I said 'launch' not 'lunch'!

SIMON

That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd

like to quickly go over the digestive

system of amphibians.

OVEUR

Do you think it's necessary to explain

everything?

SIMON

I'll meet you on board.  There's something

I have to take care of first.

TED

I have to see Bud Kruger.

RECEPTIONIST

Do you have an appointment, sir?

TED

No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or

death.

RECEPTIONIST

You'll have to be more specific than that,

sir.

TED

All right, it's a matter of death.

RECEPTIONIST

(checking her book)

Death, death.  How about the first

Thursday in March, ten o'clock.

RECEPTIONIST

You can't go in there!

TED

Don't try to stop me!

RECEPTIONIST

But that's not a door.  The door's over

there.

TED

That's strange.  I just came from...

CONTROLLER 1 (V.O.)

(on P.A.)

This is Mercury control at "T" minus fifty

minutes and counting.  Commence loading of

passengers requiring special boarding

assistance.

WIFE

Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks.

You'll need a hot meal when you get there.

JOE

We've spent everything on these

operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've

pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The

kids have no winter clothes...

WIFE

(holding a finger to his lips)

Joey, what's more important, the kids'

clothes or your sexual potency.

JOE

(anxiously looking around)

I don't want to hear that word!

WIFE

Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax.

This hospital in Des Moines is the best

sex clinic in the country.

JOE

All right.

(hands her an envelope)

Here.

WIFE

What...?

JOEY

Insurance.  Everyone buys it.

WIFE

All right.  Goodbye, Babe.

WIFE

Joey!  Remember, sexual impotence is

nothing to be ashamed of!

JOE

(to Cashier)

Time, Newsweek, the Lifesavers, and the

second time bomb from the right.

SCOTT

(Scottish accent)

My God, Dr. Spock!  You've got a meltdown

in the Reggie Bars!

DAVE

I'm telling you, Edith, space travel is

safer than driving a car.

SCALPER

Mercury seats.  I got a pair.  I got aisle

seats, window seats.  Check 'em out.

SIMON

Gentlemen, this is Captain Oveur.  He's

taking over for Frank Morgan.

MR. UNGER

What's the problem?

SIMON

Morgan was senselessly murdered about an

hour ago.

MR. DUNN

(black, sports afro)

Murdered?  I hope it's not serious.

SIMON

We won't know until after the autopsy.

MR. DUNN

Of course.  Welcome aboard, sir.

OVEUR

Good to be aboard, gentlemen.

SIMON

Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger,

and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.

OVEUR

Unger.

UNGER

Oveur.

DUNN

Oveur.

OVEUR

Dunn.

SIMON

And I think everyone knows Elaine.

TERRORIST

(to Guard)

Is flight to Miami, yes?

GUARD

No.

TERRORIST

Thank you.  Thank you.

DENTIST

Open.

SVEN

Mercury, Krista.  A whole new world to be

depressed about.

KRISTA

Ya, Sven.

CHILD 1

Will we die, Pappa?

SVEN

We all die, Ingrid.

CHILD 2

Will we die soon, Pappa?

SVEN

Soon?  What is the real meaning of 'soon'?

OVEUR

(flips a switch)

Atmosphere control.

UNGER

(flips a switch)

Atmosphere control, check.

OVEUR

(flips a switch)

Anti-gravity.

DUNN

(flips a switch)

Anti-gravity, check.

ELAINE

(to self)

That's odd.

OVEUR

(looking out the window)

I hope that weather doesn't give us a

problem.

(he opens the window and holds

his hand out)

What's your temperature reading, Mr.

Unger.

UNGER

(pulls a thermometer from his

mouth)

Ninety-eight point six.

CONTROLLER 2

There seems to be some fog rolling in from

the west.

CONTROLLER 1

Mike, give me a density reading.  I just

hope it's not too heavy.

CONTROLLER 3

(reading from a book like

Richard Burton)

The fog, the fog, the torment clouded my

mind.  Derision, contempt...

CONTROLLER 1

That's heavy.

MARY

(to Stella and father)

Welcome aboard.  Isn't that Dr.

Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?

STELLA

Yes -- he's dying and wants to be buried

in the new l-a-n-d.

MARY

(to Joe Salucci)

Welcome aboard.  Can I take your case?

JOE

(clutching case)

No!

HENRY

There's a whole new world in front of us,

Ma.  Where the dictatorship of the

proletariat will lead workers and peasants

into socialism without the revisionist

diversions of bourgeois liberals,

Trotskiests, or disillusioned Maoist

terrorism.

MARY

(looking at them; to self)

Doesn't he realize that a weak proletariat

needs a strong liberal bourgeoisie in a

joint struggle against monopoly

capitalism?

PSYCHIATRIST

We can't begin to help you until you admit

that you are sick, Ted.

(echo)

Sick Ted, sick Ted, sick Ted...

SARG

(to CO-WORKER)

Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle; Ted

Striker.

(holding burnt wire)

Jack, I got a bad feeling in my gut about

this mission.

WORKER

What'd you have for dinner?

SARG

The fish, why?

OVEUR

We should be ready to launch as soon as

this fog lifts.

MARY

Can I hang that for you, sir?

MAN

Thanks.

UNGER

It looks like that weather is clearing.

TED

Elaine.

ELAINE

Ted!  What are you...?

TED

I have to get in there.  I have to stop

this flight.

ELAINE

Ted, we're taking off!

TED

Let me by, Elaine.

MARY

Please take your seats.

TED

Elaine!

SIMON

Whenever your're ready, Captain.

OVEUR

Yes, sir, commander.

(into radio)

This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A-

okay up here and ready for count-down.

DISSOLVE TO:

ELAINE

Ted seemed to get worse after I told him

about Simon, Doctor.

RUMACK

The human brain is a highly complex organ,

Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to

the bladder.

(he stops at a patient in a

wheelchair with his back TO

CAMERA)

Let me show you.

(Rumack removes the top of the

patient's skull and takes out

his brain as they continue on)

Ted's problem is in this area.

(points with a pencil)

This area, this area, here, here, here,

under here, here...

RUMACK

So you see, our task isn't made any easier

by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.

ELAINE

What can I do, Doctor Rumack?

RUMACK

You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and

take Geritol.

ELAINE

I mean for Ted.

RUMACK

You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's

been working out a lot of his aggressions

here in the garden.

ELAINE

Is that a good sign, Doctor?

RUMACK

It does the job.

ELAINE

Hello, Ted.

ELAINE

(holding out box)

I brought you some spaghetti.

ELAINE

What are you doing, Ted?

TED

I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out

what's wrong with the shuttle!

ELAINE

Ted.

TED

Not now, Elaine!

ELAINE

Ted!

RUMACK

The brain is an amazingly complex organ,

Elaine.

ELAINE

Is he making any progress, Doctor?

RUMACK

Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only

this high.

Jettison booster stages one and two.

UNGER

(flipping switches)

Booster jettisoned.

OVEUR

Shut down accelerators.

DUNN

Accelerators down.

OVEUR

Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference

scan.  Those sun spots might give us a

problem with our communications.

ELAINE

(flipping computer switches)

Yes, sir.

ELAINE

(to self)

That's really strange.

ELAINE

Intermitant failure in scan mode "R".

Analyze.

ROK

Negative.

ELAINE

(to self)

That doesn't make sense.

(to ROK)

Repeat analysis.

ROK

Negative.

ELAINE

(to self)

That's not possible.

ROK

Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I

know where I'm coming from on this.

MARY

I guess this is pretty exciting for you.

GIRL

Yes, it is.  How long will the trip take?

MARY

Our actual flight time is over fourteen

months, but due to the time-space variant

at sub-light speeds, our onboard flight

time will be just over eighteen hours.

GIRL

Gee, Mom, how does that work?

WOMAN

(very tense)

How many times do I have to tell you, I'm

not your mother!  I've never seen you

before!

GIRL (V.O.)

Why did she yell at me like that?

MAN

Hallucinating again, Rhonda?

GIRL

(taking a paper bag away from

her face)

I don't know what it is.

MAN

Maybe it's the brand of glue you've been

sniffing.  Why don't you try this, NO-HI.

It gives you all the pleasure of glue

without the brain damage.

TESTA

Something to read, sir?

JOE

(clutching his case)

Do you have PSYCHO MONTH?

TESTA

I think so.  Here you are.

MARY

(to Texan)

Would you like something to read?

TEXAN

I don't read a whole lot, but what have

you got, hon?

MARY

TIME, NEWSWEEK, BUSINESS WEEK, and the

TALMUD...

MARY

The twenty-four volume dissertation on the

Hebrew law.

TEXAN

Let me try that Talmud.

MARY

(to Ted)

And you, sir?

TED

(distracted)

Oh... Popular Electronics.

PSYCHIATRIST

You must admit that you're sick, Ted.

(echo)

Sick Ted, sick Ted...

TEXAN

(to Ted)

Wanta switch when we're finished?

TED

Here.  I need some oxygen.

SIMON

Have you got it straightened out now?

ELAINE

I think so.

SIMON

That's my girl.

ROK

Elaine, I'm sorry about that little

outburst a moment ago.

ELAINE

That's okay, ROK.

ROK

Can I say something of a personal nature

to you?

ELAINE

Go ahead.

ROK

You have great tits.

ELAINE

(getting up)

Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary

readout unit.

SIMON

Roger.

OVEUR

(on intercom)

Yes, Mary?

MARY

Would you like a little breakfast, Captain

Oveur?  Over.

OVEUR

A couple eggs and juice would be nice,

Mary.  Over.

MARY (V.O.)

(on intercom)

How would you like your eggs, Captain?

Over.

OVEUR

No.  Poached.  Over.

MARY (V.O.)

(on intercom)

Poached and over, Captain Oveur?  Over.

OVEUR

Just poached on toast.  Over.

MARY

(on intercom)

I don't think we do poached eggs on toast

over, Captain Oveur.  Over.

OVEUR

That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.

MARY

All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.

OVEUR

Poached!  Not over!  Over!

MARY

You should really put that case in the

compartment above your head, sir.

JOE

(nervously)

That's okay.

MARY

(touching his shoulder)

I can help you if you can't get it up.

JOE

I said, no!

JIMMY

I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up

here with us.

JOHN

I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.

JIMMY

Do you think things will be a lot

different on Mercury, Dad?

JOHN

It's going to be terrific.  A whole new

world, new kids to play with.

ALICE

You're going to love it, Jimmy.

JIMMY

No more headlines about the rape trial and

the fraud charges?

JOHN

(starts to twitch)

How many kids get a chance to live on

another planet.

JIMMY

No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a

thieving rapist'?

JOHN

(grabbing Jimmy)

Look, a man can make an honest mistake!!

Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're

all asking for it all the time!!

ALICE (V.O.)

Not John's irregularity again.

PSYCHIATRIST

You must admit that you're sick, Ted...

sick, Ted... sick, Ted...

DUNN

We seem to have a malfunction in disposal

unit four, sir.

OVEUR

You better check it, Unger.

UGER

(getting up)

Done.

DUNN

Yes?

TED

Elaine.

ELAINE

Ted.  I don't know why you got on this

flight.  I don't know what you're trying

to prove.

TED

Elaine, we have to go back.

ELAINE

We can't go back.  We had something very

special, but it's all over.

TED

Elaine, I mean the mission has to be

aborted.  This ship should never have

passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held

together by string and chewing gum.

ELAINE

Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should

never have left the hospital.

TED

Then you do think I'm insane.

ELAINE

I've never used the word insane, Ted.

TED

(facetiously)

What word would you use, Elaine?

ELAINE

The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very

sick.

TED

What would you say if I told you the

toilet just blew up in my face.

ELAINE

I'd use the word insane.

TED

There's something dangerously wrong with

this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring.

That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.

ELAINE

Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.

STELLA

You've been hurt.

TED

I'm getting over it.  If a relationship

isn't working, you can't force it.

STELLA

No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll

take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.

STELLA

Do you want to talk about it.

TED

I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner

hit me.

STELLA

No.  I mean your relationship.

TED

We were in love but I'm not sure I know

what love is anymore.

STELLA

Love's the same as it always was.  It's

people who change.

TED

People change in relation to each other.

Love changes on its own.

STELLA

Not if the people change together in

relation to that love.

TED

Sure.  But that's only when the love

itself goes unchanged.

STELLA

Then the relationship remains the same and

the love changes only when there's change

in the two people who share that love.

TED

I just wish it was that simple.  We really

were in love.  You know how it is when you

laugh all the time.

STELLA

No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your

father's dying.

TED

Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the

time.

DISSOLVE TO:

TED (V.O.)

We laughed when times were good.

TED (V.O.)

Even when times weren't so good, we still

laughed.

TED (V.O.)

But most of all, we laughed when we felt

closest to each other.

DISSOLVE BACK TO:

TED

That's our story.

DUNN

(to Oveur)

Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit

four.

OVEUR

You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll

stay here and fly the ship.

OVEUR

Dunn.

DUNN

Sir?

OVEUR

You better take this.

MARY

Mind if Jimmy here takes a look around,

Captain?

OVUER

Of course not.  Come on in, Jimmy.

(checking his navigational

screen)

That's strange.

SIMON

Now what?

OVEUR

That's an asteroid field.  There shouldn't

be anything like that in this sector

unless...

SIMON

Unless?

OVEUR

Unless those sunspots are interfering with

our scanner or...

SIMON

Or?

OVEUR

Or we're off course, but...

SIMON

But?

OVEUR

But we couldn't be off course.  Our

coordinates are computer-locked barring...

SIMON

Barring?

OVEUR

Barring a computer failure.  There was

talk of sub-par wiring in this ship.  I

hope that's just talk.

OVEUR

Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some

puppy.  What's his name?

JIMMY

Scraps.

OVEUR

Can I hold him?

JIMMY

(handing over Scraps)

Sure.

OVEUR

(holding him up and looking at

his underbelly)

He's a boy dog.

JIMMY

Yeah.

OVEUR

Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his

back, Jimmy?

TED

They kept me in the asylum for eight

months.  I know everyone in those places

claims they're sane, but I was different,

I was sane.

ELAINE

Holy shit.

STELLA

Ted, I want you to relax.  Let your mind

go back, back past your youth, past your

childhood to your mother's womb.

STELLA

Try to remember your birth.  Was it

difficult?

DOCTOR'S VOICE

Striker, listen to me!  This is Doctor

Krane!  You're twisted around, Striker.

You've got to come out feet first!  You're

too low in the womb!  You're too low,

Striker!  You're...

(fading)

... too low...

STELLA

Ted, are you okay?  Here, take one of

these stress pills.

ELAINE

(to ROK)

Request; comprehensive electrical systems

check.

ROK

Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine,

I...

ELAINE

Request; life support systems check.

ROK

Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious

you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman.

I can relate to that.

ELAINE

(panicky and confused)

Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and

software systems regarding behavioral

changes.

ROK

There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine.

What about tonight -- just you and me.  We

can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone

else on the ship -- I've already proven

that.

JIMMY

Do you want to talk about it, Commander?

DUNN

Did you feel that?

MARY

(looking at his pants)

Yes I did...

DUNN

Felt like a large asteroid.

MARY

Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a

personal question?

DUNN

What is it, Mary?

MARY

Um...  Do you people scream right when

you... you know.

TESTA

Hand me your cup.  This is very hot.

DAVE

Thank you.  And, stewardess, can you

please tell my wife that there is nothing

that can go wrong.  I think she'd like to

hear it from you.

ELAINE

I don't think we have any alternative,

Captain.

OVEUR

I see.  What do you think our alternatives

are?

ELAINE

We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain

functions without disturbing his

regulatory system.

OVEUR

Roger.

ELAINE

You can do it from up here, Captain.

OVEUR

I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.

ELAINE

No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.

OVEUR

Roger.  You better get back there and

monitor the regulatory unit.

MARY

Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and

I don't like it.

OVEUR

Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?

TESTA

Captain Oveur, Dunn and Unger have been

sucked out through disposal unit four!

OVEUR

Both together?!

MARY/TESTA

Dunn and Unger have been sucked out

through disposal unit four!!

OVEUR

All right, calm down.  Here's how we're

going to play it.

OVEUR

Mary, I want you here.  Testa, you move

across here past Dawkins' pick and get the

ball at the top of the key from Irving.

ROK

What are you doing, Captain?

ROK

I wouldn't do that, Captain.

OVEUR

SIMON

(to self)

We're off course, heading right through

that asteroid field and right at the... at

the sun!

O'FLANAGAN

Listen to me!  Listen to me, my children!

O'FLANAGAN

Please listen.  Thank you, my children.

I'm a man of God, you must trust me when I

say... we're all going to die!!

O'BRIAN

You're right.  They're off course and

heading right for the sun.  I've seen

enough, Bob.

O'BRIAN

Get me Jack McCrosky and fast!

CONTROLLER 3

McCrosky?  He hasn't handled a tower in

twenty years.

CONTROLLER 4

Ever since Reagan fired the controllers,

he's been completely senile and hasn't

done a day's work.

O'BRIAN

What about McCrosky?

CONTROLLER 3

Pretty much the same as Reagan.

O'BRIAN

Get him.

NURSE

It's for Mr. McCrosky.

NURSE 2

Do you think we should bother him?  He's

been acting a bit odd lately.

NURSE 1

He's fine.  He just thinks he's Lloyd

Bridges.

NURSE 1

The phone's for you, Mr. McCrosky.

McCROSKY

What's a phone?

NURSE 1

(holding it to his ear)

Here, let me help you.  I think it's the

space centre.  Now, let's not get too

excited.

McCROSKY

What?

(pause)

What?

(pulls off his scuba mask and

snorkle)

What?

(gets more alert and grabs a

cigarette)

I'll be right down!

(he hangs up and jumps out of

bed)

Looks like I picked the wrong time to go

senile.

ELAINE

Simon!

(she spots Oveur slumped on the

panel)

Captain Oveur!

OVEUR

(still gasping)

Mets... nine... Phils... three... Cubs...

four...

ELAINE

Simon, what's happening?!

SIMON

He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed

him.  That computer is running this ship

and we're heading right for the sun.

ELAINE

Can't we change course?

SIMON

We're computer locked and the manual

navigation unit is down.

ELAINE

Then Ted was right!

ZOOM TO:

SIMON

My career is shot.

ELAINE

Your career!  What about the lives of

those people out there.  Simon, what

happened to the man I thought I loved?

ELAINE

I've got to get Ted.  Just don't come

apart on me now, Simon.

TERRORIST 1

This is flight to Miami, yes?

ELAINE

No.

ELAINE

(to passengers)

Please, ladies and gentlemen, please calm

down.  Listen to me!

ELAINE

We've been thrown off course just a tad.

PASSENGER

What's that mean?

ELAINE

In space terms, about 70 million miles.

ELAINE

The bumps you feel are car-sized asteroids

smashing into the hull.

ELAINE

Also, we're heading right for the sun and

can't seem to change course.

PASSENGER

Are you telling us everything?

ELAINE

Not exactly.  We're also out of coffee.

O'FLANAGAN

Pray with me, my children.  Pray.

MRS. GOOCH

But Father, I'm not Catholic.

O'FLANAGAN

Then worship the god of your choice.

BOB

I've always loved you, darling.  I was

unfaithful just once.  Remember Jill, my

first secretary?  Forgive me.

MARY-JANE

I knew all about it.  I was unfaithful

once, too.

BOB

That's all behind us now.

MARY-JANE

Remember Harriet, your first receptionist?

PASSENGER

We're going to crash!!

TERRORIST 1

God is great!!

TERRORIST 2

Death to America!!

TERRORIST 3

The yellow pencil is on the table of my

aunt!!

ELAINE

There is absolutely nothing to worry

about!

ELAINE

Your crew is in complete control of the

situation.

McCROSKY

Get me a cup of coffee, mister.

CONTROLLER 1

Yes, sir.

McCROSKY

And a gallon of milk of magnesia, and a

ham on rye, no cheese!

CONTROLLER 1

Yes, sir! Welcome home, sir!

CONTROLLER 2

(approaching McCrosky)

Here are the navigational charts, sir.

McCROSKY

Thanks.

McCROSKY

Get me a readout on their fuel capacity.

CONTROLLER 3

Yes, sir.

CONTROLLER 4

Here's all the available information on

the sun.  That thing's hot, sir.

McCROSKY

Ahhhhhh!  Get me Bud Kruger immediately!

(spotting Jacobs)

Jacobs, I want to know absolutely

everything that's happened up till now!

JACOBS

First the earth cooled.  Then the

dinosaurs came but were too big and died

and everything got rotten and turned into

oil and the Arabs bought Mercedes Benzs

and then there was the best TV special on

Judy Garland.  Then we lost the war with

Albania.  Then...

McCROSKY

Things sure haven't changed.

ELAINE

Ted, Ted.  Listen to me, Ted.  You were

right all along.  Ted, we've lost the crew

and Simon's turned to jelly!

CONTROLLER 1 (V.O.)

(on radio)

Come in, Mayflower.  This is mission

control.  Over.  Come in, Mayflower!

Over!

JIMMY

Do you want to talk about it now,

Commander?

ELAINE

My God.

STELLA

He's finally come to terms with his own

psychosis.

ELAINE

But he was right!  He's not crazy!

STELLA

Miss, I'm a nurse with a dying F-A-T-H-E-

R, I know what I'm talking about.  Now I'm

going to need fresh sheets, gauze, Q-tips,

and all the vaseline you have on board!

Now!

STELLA

(to Mary)

I'll need all the boiling water you can

get your hands on!

MAN

Are you a nurse?

STELLA

Yes.

(handing him a urine bottle)

The washroom's down there on your right.

STELLA

(yelling after him)

And not too much!

SERGEANT

Can I help?

STELLA

Keep an eye on that side of the ship.

MARY

(to passengers)

I'll need all your boiling water.

TESTA

We should be out of this momentarily.

There's nothing to worry about.

ALICE

Thank you.  That makes me feel so much

better.

O'FLANAGAN

Trust me, I'm a priest.  We're in shit up

DISSOLVE TO:

GUARD ONE

(Southern accent)

Damn!  I want that patient shot on sight!

TED

Maybe you gotta be crazy to end up behind

the eight ball like this.  Anyway, you

find out pretty fast who your friends are

when you're on the lamb.

TED

(to lamb)

I'm going out for cigarettes and a fifth

of bourbon.  Don't wait up for me.

TED

Virgin wool.  Nothin' but headaches.

TED (V.O.)

I travelled at night in the shadows.  I

didn't want to attract attention.

TED (V.O.)

I was afraid to step out of the doorways.

You never know what to expect when you're

on the run.

CUT TO:

TED (V.O.)

There I was, minding my own business when

I looked up and saw a pair of legs that

went forever.

TED (V.O.)

But I had a date with Harry's.  It was

little more than a hole in a wall on the

south side of Chicago.

TED (V.O.)

Harry's was perfect for me.  The kind of

place you go if you don't want to be

recognized.

TED (V.O.)

It was rough, real rough.

TED (V.O.)

The kind of place you could score

anything, from junk...

TED (V.O.)

...to Phil Donahue's book.

TED (V.O.)

At Harry's you could count on a fight

breaking out almost every night.

PROFESSOR 1

And I say essence precedes existence.

PROFESSOR 2

You're crazy!  Existence precedes essence.

PROFESSOR 1

Essence!

PROFESSOR 2

Existence!

TED (V.O.)

There was a small trio in one corner.

TED (V.O.)

And a larger trio in the other corner.

TED

The last thing I wanted was Elaine to see

me down on my luck.  Well, it was just my

luck.  In she walked with a group from the

space program.

TED (V.O.)

They'd come to Harry's to slum it and try

their hand at the video bull.

TED (V.O.)

Elaine made that ride look easy.  It was

obvious why I was still nuts about her.

She loved life.  I didn't want her to

notice me so I borrowed a pair of dark

glasses.

TED (V.O.)

Grabbed an alto sax and joined the group.

TED (V.O.)

I stayed in the background not wanting to

draw attention to myself.

TED (V.O.)

Then what happened?  Elaine's crowd talks

her into joining us for a song.

ELAINE

I don't know who you are or how you lost

your sight, but I'll never forget this

night as long as I live.

I'm afraid that leg's going to have to

We all make mistakes, Elaine.

McCROSKY (V.O.)

Come in Mayflower!

ELAINE

How could I ever have doubted you?

McCROSKY (V.O.)

This is mission control!  Over!

TED

That's all behind us now, Elaine.  And no

matter what happens, I want you to know

I've always loved you.

McCROSKY (V.O.)

Jesus, would someone answer me!!

ELAINE

I love you, Ted.

McCROSKY (V.O.)

What the hell's going on up there?!

ELAINE

(smiling lovingly)

Ted, this reminds me of twenty years ago

over Chicago.

TED

This is Mayflower One calling mission

control.  Do you read me?  Over.

McCROSKY

A man.  Now that's more like it.

This is mission control.  Identify

yourself and give me your position.  Over.

Ted Striker!

McCROSKY

Damn!  We've lost them again.

Me!  Me!  Me!

COMMISSIONER

The boys downtown are taking the heat from

of the crew has been lost and we're out of

coffee.  Also, we're starting to feel the

sun's heat pretty bad.

MAN ONE

It's eight-thousand square feet with great

parking and a twenty-year lease with

option to buy.

MAN TWO

You can't lose, Al.

MAN THREE

He can lose.  I've seen it happen a

thousand times.

McCROSKY

Striker, this is Jack McCrosky, chief

controller.  I want you to listen to me and

listen good.

McCROSKY

Twenty years ago I helped a young pilot

through a storm over Chicago.

McCROSKY

He didn't have a crew either.  He said he

couldn't do it.  But when the going got

tough that kid pulled it together.

McCROSKY

You might have read about him; he made all

the big papers and the Canadian Jewish

News.

McCROSKY

I don't know where he is today but if he

was up there right now, I know he'd find

some way to turn that bucket around and

get the hell out of there, pronto!

JACOBS

I wish I could talk like that -- so macho

yet so sensitive.

McCROSKY

I just hope I said the right thing.

TED (V.O.)

I'm afraid you gave the wrong speech.

McCrosky.  I'm not your problem.  It's

this ship.  That computer's gone bananas.

McCROSKY

(holding up the book)

Why the hell are we still using the old

manual!  Burn this book!

McCROSKY

(on radio)

Just hold on, Striker, we'll get back to

you.

TESTA

The cabin temperature is rising.  The

passengers want to know what's happening

up here.

TED

Let us handle this end of things.  Now

what's the coffee situation?

TESTA

It just won't drip!  I've tried

everything.  And the passengers are

dropping like flies from the heat.

TED

Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold

onto that stick and try to control this

hunk of tin as best you can.

ELAINE

Ted, please be careful.

OFFICER

(to Joe)

It doesn't look good.  The drip seems to

be jammed up pretty bad.

MR. COFFEE

Did they change the filter and wait for

the brew sign to light up?

OFFICER

(stopping and looking Mr.

Coffee in the eye)

To tell you the truth, sir, I don't really

know.

CONTROLLER 3

(reading his slip)

Eighty-three.  What's that mean?

CONTROLLER WITH HAT

If eighty-three passengers die, you win

the two hundred bucks.

OFFICER

Mr. McCrosky, Mr. Coffee.  Coffee,

McCrosky.

McCROSKY

Thanks for coming down so soon.

MR. COFFEE

(checking watch)

I won't come down for another couple

hours.

McCROSKY

I'll put you on the radio with Striker.

Jeez you look familiar.  Did you ever play

water polo?

MR. COFFEE

Not to my knowledge.

McCROSKY

I thought so.

MR. COFFEE

Have you got the back panel off the brew

TED

Check.

MR. COFFEE (V.O.)

There's a terminal at the base of the

coil.  That's your contact point.

PASSENGER

Is this a coffee bean?

ALL PASSENGERS

(maniacally)

He's got a bean!!

TED

It looks like the solder point has melted.

MR. COFFEE

Just what I thought.  When the hell will

listen good.

DETECTIVE HALLICK

Who's in charge here, Mister?

McCROSKY

McCrosky, Control.

DETECTIVE HALLICK

Hallick, homicide.

JACOBS

Jacobs, Pisces.

KRUGER

Kruger, Sagittarius.

COMMISSIONER

Commissioner, Aquarius.

DETECTIVE HALLICK

We have information that one of your

passengers is carrying a bomb and might be

suicidal.

McCROSKY

Where'd you get this information, Captain?

DETECTIVE HALLICK

We have our methods.

KRUGER

And what methods are those?

DETECTIVE HALLICK

Have you heard of the Heimlich method?

McCROSKY

The method of saving someone choking on a

piece of gristle?

DETECTIVE HALLICK

Exactly.

KRUGER/McCROSKY/COMMISSIONER

We're familiar with it.

DETECTIVE HALLICK

Good.  This is the passenger's wife.  Mrs.

Joe Salucci.

McCROSKY

What makes you think your husband might

want to blow up that shuttle, ma'am?

MRS. SALUCCI

This insurance policy.

MRS. SALUCCI

An electric tooth.

(handing McCrosky the insurance

form)

Joey was supposed to go to Des Moines for

an operation to cure his impotence.

McCROSKY

The Des Moines Institute?

MRS. SALUCCI

Then you know it.

KRUGER/McCROSKY/COMMISSIONER

Yes, we're familiar with it.

MRS. SALUCCI

Well, I found out Joey got on this shuttle

instead and...

DETECTIVE HALLICK

The way I read it, blowin' up a plane in

space leaves no traces, if you know what I

mean.

KRUGER

I'm not exactly sure what you mean,

Captain.

DETECTIVE HALLICK

No blood.  No body.  No bones.  No eyes.

No ears.  No throats.

McCROSKY

(looking at form)

This is $500,000 worth of insurance!

McCROSKY

Just a second.  This is insurance on his

car!

MRS. SALUCCI

That's what worries me.

KRUGER

He's impotent.

COMMISSIONER

He's suicidal.

ALL

And he's stupid!

MR. COFFEE

(into radio)

This is it, Striker.  You got one shot and

one shot only.

TED

(to self)

Contact.

McCROSKY

How are we going to handle this bomb nut?

CONTROLLER 2

(rushes up with printouts)

Here are the tests we ran on their

computer.  I had them xeroxed for you.

McCROSKY

How'd they come out?

CONTROLLER 2

Upside-down, but I turned each page over

and put them in order.  I'm afraid that

computer is totally capable of taking

control of that ship.

McCROSKY

Let's keep cool.  There's gotta be a way

to control it.

CONTROLLER 3

(rushes up with diagrams)

These are their position calculations.

They've got about ten minutes before they

start to burn up.

McCROSKY

Keep calm.  A lot can happen in ten

minutes.

(to self)

What next?

CONTROLLER 4

(rushes in)

Sir, your headlights are on and your doors

are locked!

McCROSKY

(spitting out coffee, Danny

Thomas style)

Jesus!!  I'll be right back!

ELAINE

Ted, we've only got ten minutes.

TED

(thinking she wants sex)

Not now, Elaine.

ELAINE

I mean until we start to burn up.

TED

We're closer to the sun than I estimated.

KRUGER (V.O.)

Come in, Mayflower.  This is Bud Kruger.

Over.

TED

(on radio)

This is Striker.

KRUGER

(on radio)

Look, Striker, I don't know how you got

into that driver's seat but I want Simon

Kurtz on that radio and I want him now!

TED

(on radio)

Kurtz was the one who got us into this

mess in the first place.  You people knew

this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played

God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and

for what -- the prestige of your precious

space program.

ELAINE

That was very well put, Ted.

KRUGER

(on radio)

Striker, you're heading right for the sun,

so don't you think it's a little late for

that bleeding heart liberal crap now?

ELAINE

He's got a point, Ted.

TED

(on radio)

Call me a bleeding heart, but if we get

through this thing I'm preparing a paper

on alternative spending directives

recommending the transfer of space program

funds to low cost housing.

KRUGER

(on radio)

Just put Kurtz on that radio!!

McCROSKY

(enraged)

Look, Kruger, you and your people have

caused enough trouble already.  I don't

care about your political games, I care

about only one thing, the lives of those

people up there!!!  Out of my control

room!!

JACOBS

Someone's car wouldn't start.

McCROSKY

(on mike)

Striker, this is McCrosky.  Give me five

minutes and keep your fingers crossed.

(to Stinson)

Stinson, get me the Mayflower plans!

(to Controller 3)

You, clear this table!

JACOBS

I'll get the cards and bridge mix.

McCROSKY

And someone get me the Sarg!

CUT TO:

SARG

That's my little girl, my little darlin',

my sweetheart, my honey, and you want to

blow her belly out with that bomb.  If you

blast here in the computer core and the

fuselage doesn't give way here and the

main communication lines to the cockpit

hold here and this baby here doesn't jam

this little old unit up here and throw

about two tons of hot steel through here

like a hot knife through butter and the

upper and lower...

McCROSKY

What's your point, Sarg?

SARG

I have no point.

McCROSKY

Then it's settled.  The bomb is Striker's

only chance.  Are there any questions?

CONTROLLERS

No sir.

McCROSKY

Those are answers, I asked for questions.

CONTROLLER 3

Should a man in his forties have a

circumcision?

McCROSKY

Absolutely.

TED

Well, Elaine, this might be it if those

guys on the ground don't think of

something.

ELAINE

I just want you to know, I love you Ted

and always will.

TED

That might be the news we've been waiting

for.

McCROSKY (V.O.)

I've got some news for you, Striker.

TED

(on radio)

Roger.

McCROSKY (V.O.)

One of your passengers is carrying a bomb

and is suicidal.

ELAINE

A b...

McCROSKY (V.O.)

No, a bomb.

TED

Which passenger is Joe Salucci?

MARY

Sixteen 'C', why?

TED

He's carrying a bomb.

MARY

A b...

TED

No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as

possible, I want you to move the

passengers into the lounge.

MARY

What should I say?

TED

Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think

we're onto him.

MARY

Would everyone not carrying a bomb please

move to the lounge.

JOE

(jumping up with his case)

Don't anyone move!

TED

Mr. Salucci, listen to me.

TED

Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and

kill all these innocent people.

JOE

I don't want to live anymore.

TED

Joe, the insurance policy won't help your

wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance,

not life insurance.

JOE

What?

TED

(inching up on him)

That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to

hurt you and no one has to know what's

wrong with you.

JOE

You're sure?

TED

I'm sure.

JIMMY

(yells)

That's the guy from the terminal who can't

get it up!!

McCROSKY

Get that bomb, Striker!  Get that bomb!

ELAINE (V.O.)

Come in, Control!  We have the bomb!!

ALL CONTROLLERS

He's got the bomb!!

JACOB

This is just like an election in Iran.

TED

This heat's getting unbearable.

ELAINE

But it is a dry heat, Ted.

McCROSKY

Do we use the bomb to blow that computer

or is there another way?  I want to know

what everyone thinks.

CONTROLLER 2 (V.O.)

I think...

(changes mind)

... No.

CONTROLLER 3 (V.O.)

We could knock out the wall between the

cockpit and cabin, and hang plants.

CONTROLLER 2 (V.O.)

I think...

(changes mind)

... No.

CONTROLLER 4 (V.O.)

You can't knock that wall out.  That's a

support wall, asshole.

CONTROLLER 2 (V.O.)

I think...

(changes mind)

No.

CONTROLLER 5 (V.O.)

Did I flush?

McCROSKY

Then it's settled.  We use the bomb.

(grabs radio)

Striker, McCrosky.

McCROSKY (V.O.)

We've gone over the blueprints and you've

got only one option.

TED

(on radio)

I know what you're going to say, McCrosky

-- knock out the wall between the cockpit

and cabin and hang plants.

McCROSKY (V.O.)

Forget it.  That's a support wall.  Use

the bomb.

ELAINE

The b...

McCROSKY (V.O.)

I keep telling you, not the b...  The

bomb!!

TED

(almost to self)

Why, you'd have to be crazy to try a stunt

like that.

DOCTOR'S VOICE

You're too low in the womb, Striker!

You've got to come out feet first!

TED

(grabs case)

Elaine.  I'm going back there.

ELAINE

Ted... I love you.  Be careful.

McCROSKY

(to his controllers)

I want everyone on their toes for this

one.

McCROSKY

And if anyone has any ideas, I want to

hear them now.

JACOBS

How about a show just like Hollywood

Squares but with kids.  Gary Coleman could

host.

MARY

Now I want everyone to move to the front

of the cabin.

MARY

That's fine.  Stay calm.  We just want

everyone as far away from the blast as

possible.

ROK

What are you doing, Ted?  Why are you

wearing that mask, Ted?

ELAINE

Simon!  Wait!  What are you doing?!

O'FLANAGAN

Under the 'B', sixteen!

SIMON

I've lost the ship and now I've lost you,

Elaine.  I'm getting out.

ELAINE

Simon, I didn't want it to end like this.

We can be friends!  You'll die out there.

SIMON

Maybe.

ELAINE

Simon, what are you saying?!

SIMON

I'm saying, I can't take the singles scene

again, Elaine.

ELAINE

Simon, no!

JIMMY

You want to talk about it now, Commander?

COMMISSIONER

Give me the President of the United

States.  Tell him it's the Commissioner.

(to Kruger)

I don't know how the old man's going to

take this.

AID

Houston, sir.

PRESIDENT

(taking phone)

This is the President... What?!... What?!

COMMISSIONER

I don't think that shuttle's going to make

it, sir.

PRESIDENT

Damnit, Mister, the dignity and integrity

of this presidency depends on the success

of that mission.  And that's my last word!

COMMISSIONER

Yes, sir.

AID

What's our strategy on this one, sir?

PRESIDENT

I work for the people of these United

States, Frank.  I have to do what's best

for them.

(grabs the red phone)

Al, kill social security, cancel school

lunches only for the poor, dismantle

welfare, close all hospitals and public

toilets, green light the MX-6, invade

Brazil, and bring my horse around after my

nap!

ELAINE

Simon just ejected!

TED

Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick

works we just might make it.  Simon was a

fool to eject now.

ELAINE

You mean...

TED

That's right -- premature ejection.

ELAINE

What will happen to him, Ted?

TED

The sun will heat that thing to over 450

degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like

a pig on a spit.

TED

(looking at wristwatch)

Are you afraid?

ELAINE

Not when I'm with you, Ted.

TED

I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be

afraid at a time like this.

MAN NEXT TO HER

Are you afraid?

MRS. GOOCH

(looking at her hands)

Are these my hands?

FATHER O'FLANAGAN

(to Stella)

Are you afraid?

STELLA

I'm a nurse.  I can't afford to be afraid,

Father.

JIMMY

(to Scraps)

Are you afraid, Scraps?

SCRAPS

(he BARKS once, subtitle

translate)

Now when there's a guy like Ted Striker up

there, Jimmy.

(he BARKS one more time --

subtitles)

Now how about a little scratch on the

inner thigh?

TESTA

Fifty-six percent of the passengers are

afraid.  Twenty-nine percent are not

afraid.  Eight percent are undecided and

seven percent think Israel should give

back Finland.

TED

You better strap yourself in, Testa.

(on radio)

Mission control, this is Mayflower.  Over.

McCROSKY (V.O.)

Go ahead, Striker.

TED

(on radio)

We've got about 60 seconds before that

thing blows.  We're set to reprogram for

Mercury at zero point five WORP.

McCROKSY

(on radio)

Zero point five WORP?!

STRIKER (V.O.)

That's right.  When the bomb explodes

we're going to have a ten foot hole in the

fuselage and I want to get there as fast

as I can.  I know what this snip can do,

McCrosky.

McCROKSY

(to Controllers)

No one's ever travelled at that speed

before.

JACOBS

Last spring we did Europe in nine days.

MARY

Heads between the knees!

(looking down aisle)

Between your own knees, Father!

McCROSKY

I don't find it easy to talk at a time

like this, but I want to say something

about that guy up there.  I can sum it all

up in one word -- courage, dedication,

spirit, pride, selflessness, and g-u-t-s,

guts.  Striker's got more guts in his

little finger than most of us have in our

large intestine.  He's got guts up to his

eyeballs, guts coming out of his ears.

McCROSKY

Sure it's a cliche but great shortstops

are born, not made, and a clown is funny

in the circus but when he gets on the

highway, he's murder.  It bugged me too

when Mr. Ed refused to talk when the

neighbors came over but...

TED

(on radio)

We've blown the computer!

(to Elaine)

Elaine!  Set course change!

ELAINE

(flips a switch)

Set!

TED

Now!

ELAINE

(pushes a button)

Compute!

TED

Here goes.

TED

(on radio)

Point five WORP!

McCROSKY

Zero point five WORP, that's half the

speed of light.  We really have no idea

what can happen to the human body at that

speed.

McCROSKY (V.O.)

Striker, we're monitoring you.  You're

right on course.  At that speed you should

hit Mercury in about six minutes.  So give

yourself enough time to kill those WORP

engines.

McCROSKY

(on radio)

We'll be out of radio range in a few

seconds.  I'm going to put you in contact

with Mercury Base Alpha Beta for your

final descent.  Over.

(off mike)

Stinson, who's in command of Alpha Beta?

STINSON

Al Hammil?

CONTROLLER 3

Not anymore.  It's Rex Kramer, now.

McCROSKY

Not Rex Kramer!

CONTROLLER 3

No, Rex Kramer.

KRAMER

I know this guy, Ted Striker.  I flew with

him during the war.  He was a crack pilot

but he didn't have it in the crunch...

That is...

KRAMER

Until that day over Chicago.  He brought

that busted up 767 out of that storm like

a paper glider coming outta the baby blue.

KRAMER

But flying that shuttle is a whole

different ballgame.

KRAMER

What's the latest, Lieutenant?

OFFICER

They'll hit our atmosphere in about three

minutes, if they hold together.  They've

lost their computer and are coming in at

zero point five WORP on manual control,

sir.

KRAMER

Down scope!

KRAMER

He'll never bring that thing in on manual,

but I guess Striker's their only hope.

KRAMER

It's his ship now.  He's the top dog.

KRAMER

The big man.  The numero uno honcho.

KRAMER

The head cheese.

OFFICER 2

Sir, we have radio contact.

TESTA

(yelling)

We're travelling at one half the speed of

light.  There is nothing to worry about.

However, you might experience some

temporary metabolic changes.

KRAMER (V.O.)

Striker, this is Rex Kramer on Alpha Beta.

Do you read me?  Over.

KRAMER (V.O.)

That's right, Ted.  Rex Kramer.  We've

locked you on track beam.  You're going to

have to kill those WORP engines in exactly

thirty seconds.  Over.

McCROSKY

There's nothing else we can do for those

people out there now, except pray.

KRAMER (V.O.)

Now, Striker!  Kill WORP!

ELAINE

Ted, the lever!

TED

(on radio)

Kramer, the WORP control handle just came

off in my hand.

KRAMER (V.O.)

Try another handle!

TED

There are no more handles, only switches.

KRAMER (V.O.)

No buttons?!

TED

(looking around madly)

Just switches, lights, and knobs.

KRAMER

(looking at buttons and levers

on his panel)

I'd give my right arm to get just one of

these buttons or levers up there right

now.

(on radio)

Okay, Striker.  You're going to have to

pull that lever panel off.

TED

(to Elaine)

Screw driver!

KRAMER (V.O.)

Now find a piece of metal and stick it in

there.

ELAINE

Will this work, Ted?

TED

Thanks.

(on radio)

I've got something that might work.

TED (V.O.)

A bobby pin.

KRAMER

What the hell is a man doing with a...

forget it.

(on radio)

It'll have to do, Striker.

TED

It's working.

KRAMER

(on radio)

Okay, Striker.  We have you on visual.

Just keep her level.

TED

She's coming apart!

KRAMER (V.O.)

Keep her nose up!  Don't fight her!

TED

I'm trying but she's fighting me!

ELAINE

Ted, that's Alpha Beta!

KRAMER

(on radio)

Now, Striker, there are a few things you

have to keep in mind as you get close to

the planet's atmosphere.

KRAMER

(on radio)

First and foremost you have to make one

very important decision.

ELAINE

Ted!  We're not stopping!!

KRAMER (V.O.)

Is this a landing you're sure you can make

without endangering the lives of your

passengers?

KRAMER

(on radio)

Now, once you've made that decision you

have to be very clear about your

responsibility to those people on that

ship.

ELAINE

Ted!

KRAMER (V.O.)

Their lives, their futures, their goals

and aspirations are in your hands,

Striker.

MARY

(to one passenger)

Seat backs up.  Thank you.

MARY

(looking up)

Sir, you really must take your seat.

KRAMER

(on radio)

We're all with you on this one, Striker.

Now get ready to position landing gear,

cut engines, and fire your retrorockets.

KRAMER

(on radio)

Timing's of the essence on a lame duck

approach, Striker.  Don't fight her.  Hold

her steady.  Nose up.

VOICES (O.S.)

You'll be all right!  Everyone's going to

be okay!

KRAMER (V.O.)

Don't fight her, Striker.  Hold her!  Hold

her!  Stay with her, Striker!

KRAMER (V.O.)

Now, hit your landing gear and cut those

engines!

KRAMER

(on radio)

Timing's everything, Striker!  Fire your

retro-rockets!

KRAMER (V.O.)

(voice fading)

Now give her full flap and keep that nose

up.  Okay, now!
