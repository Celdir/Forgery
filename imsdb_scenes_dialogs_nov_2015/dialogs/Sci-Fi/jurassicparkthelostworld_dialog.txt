THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK

THE LOST WORLD

JURASSIC PARK

Screenplay by

David Koepp

based on the novel by

Michael Crichton

ISLA SORNA

87 miles southeast of Nublar

MRS. BOWMAN

Cathy!  Don't wander off!

MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)

Cathy, come back!  You can look for

shells right here!

BOWMAN

(eyes still in his book)

Leave her alone.

MRS. BOWMAN

What about snakes?

BOWMAN

There's no snakes on a beach.  Let

her have fun, for once.

CATHY

Please be quiet, please be quiet

please be quiet...

CATHY

Well, hello there!

CATHY (cont'd)

What are you?  A little bird or

something?

CATHY (cont'd)

Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

CATHY (cont'd)

Come on.  I won't hurt you.

CATHY (cont'd)

Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!

I found something!

CATHY (cont'd)

(terrified)

What do you guys want?

MRS. BOWMAN

Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

MRS. BOWMAN

PAUL!

DISSOLVE TO:

VOICE (O.S.)

The hurricane seemed like a disaster

at the time, but now I think it was a

blessing, nature's way of freeing

those animals from their human

confines.  Of giving them another

chance to survive, but this time as

they were meant to, without man's

interference.

HAMMOND (cont'd)

There are some corporate issues that

are not about the bottom line.  We

have so much still to learn about

those creatures.  A whole world of

intricate, interlocking behaviors,

vanished everywhere -- except for

Site B. Please.  Let's not do what

is good for more men at the expense

at what is best for all mankind.

CHAIRMAN

Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

LUDLOW

(an accent similar to

Hammond's)

These pictures were taken in a

hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight

hours ago, after an American family

on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site

B.  The little girl will be fine, but

her parents are wealthy, angry, and

very fond of lawsuits.  But that's

hardly new to us, is it?

(takes a paper from the

file)

Wrongful death settlements, partial

list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5

million dollars; family of Robert

Muldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or

destroyed equipment, 17.3 million.

Demolition, de-construction, and

disposal of Isla Nublar facilities,

organic and inorganic, one hundred

and twenty-six million dollars.  The

list goes on, gentlemen -- research

funding, media payoffs.  Silence is

expensive.

LUDLOW (cont'd)

This corporation has been bleeding

from the throat for four years.  You,

our board of directors, have set

patiently and listened to ecology

lectures while Mr. Hammond signed

your checks and spent your money.

You have watched your stock drop from

seventy-eight and a quarter to

nineteen flat with no good and in

sight.  And all along, we have held a

significant product asset that we

could have safely harvested and

displayed for profit.  Enormous

profit.

LUDLOW (cont'd)

Enough money to wipe out four years

of lawsuits and damage control and

unpleasant infighting, enough to not

only send our stock back to where it

was but to double it.  And the one

thing, the only thing standing

between us and this asset is a

born-again naturalist who happens to

be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work

for Mother Nature.  I work for you.

LUDLOW (cont'd)

"Whereas the Chief Executive

Officer has engaged in wasteful and

negligent business practices to

further his own personal

environmental beliefs --

Whereas these practices have

affected the financial performance

of the company by incurring

significant losses --

Whereas the shareholders have been

materially harmed by these losses --

Thereby, be it resolved that John

Parker Hammond should be resolved from

the office of Chief Executive

Officer, affective immediately."  Mr.

Chairman, I move the resolution be

put to an immediate vote.  Do I have

a second?

BOARD MEMBER

I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,

Please poll the members by a show of

hands.

CHAIRMAN

All those in favor of InGen Corporate

Resolution 213C, please signify your

approval by raising your right hand.

CUT TO:

DIETER

Yeah.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

(under his breath)

Shit.

MAN

You're him, aren't you?

MALCOLM

Excuse me?

MAN

The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you

on TV.

(conspiratorially)

I believed you.

MAN (cont'd)

Roooooarr.

MALCOLM

(a withering look)

I was misquoted.  I was merely

speculating on the evolutionary

scenario of a Lost World.  I never

said I was in any such place.

BUTLER

Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is

calling?

MALCOLM

Ian Malcolm

BUTLER

Not an animal lover?

MALCOLM

Not really.

HAMMOND

Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway

like an ingenue, come in, come in!

HAMMOND (cont'd)

It's good to see you.  It really is.

How's the leg?

MALCOLM

Resentful.

HAMMOND

When you have a lot of time to think,

it's funny who you remember.  It's

the people who challenged you.  It is

the quality of our opponents that

gives our accomplishments meaning.  I

never told you how sorry I was about

what happened after we returned.

MALCOLM

I didn't know you -- weren't well.

HAMMOND

It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are

finally killing me.

MALCOLM

They do have motives.  Why did you

want to see me?  Your message said it

was urgent.

HAMMOND

You were right -- and I was wrong.

There!  Did you ever think you'd hear

me say that?  Spectacularly wrong.

Instead of observing those animals, I

tried to control them.  I squandered

an opportunity and we still know next

to nothing about their lives.  Not

their lives as man would have them,

behind electric fences, but in the

wild.  Behavior in their natural

habitat, the impossible dream of any

paleontologist.  I could have had it,

but I let it slip away.

(pause)

Thank God for Site B.

MALCOLM

What?

HAMMOND

(a spark in his eye)

Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle

compact to you?

MALCOLM

What are you talking about?

HAMMOND

The hatchery, in particular?  You

know my initial yields had to be low,

far less than one percent, that's a

thousand embryos for every single

live birth.  Genetic engineering on

that scale implies a giant operation,

not the spotless little laboratory I

showed you.

MALCOLM

I don't believe you.

HAMMOND

Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,

something for the tourists, Site B

was the factory floor.  We built it

first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some

miles from Nublar.

MALCOLM

No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

HAMMOND

After the accident at the park, a

hurricane wiped out our facility on

Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave

the animals to fend for themselves.

And they did.  For four years I've

fought to keep them safe from human

meddling, now I want you to go there

and document them.

MALCOLM

Are you out of your mind?  I still

have nightmares, my reputation's a

joke, my leg is shot -- you think I

need more of that?

HAMMOND

It would be the most extraordinary

living fossil record the world has

ever seen.

MALCOLM

So what?

HAMMOND

I've been putting this together for

over a year.

(MORE)

I have personal suggestions for your

entire team, phone numbers, contact

people.  They won't believe you about

what they're going to see, so don't

bother trying to convince them.  Just

use my checkbook to get them there.

I'll fund your expedition through my

personal accounts, as such money and

equipment as you need, but only if

you leave immediately.  If we

hesitate, all will be lost.

MALCOLM

John . . .

HAMMOND

You'll need an animal behaviorist,

someone with unimpeachable

credentials.  I believe you already

know Sarah Harding.  She's got

theories about parenting and

nurturing among hunter/scavengers I

bet she'd be dying to prove on a

scale like this.  If you convince her

to go, it'll be a major coup.  When

she publishes, the scientific

community must take it seriously.

HAMMOND

Your documentation, you should use

forensic photographic methods,

Hasselbladt still cameras, high

definition video.  When the trick

photography analysts take your

evidence apart, make it impossible

for them to say there was enhancement

or computer graphic imaging.  Oh,

this is very important -- avoid the

island interior at all costs.  Stick

to the outer rim.  Everything you

need to know can be found there.

Vindication lies on the outer rim.

MALCOLM

I'm not going, John.

HAMMOND

(fatigue returning)

Ian, you are my last chance to give

something of real value to the world.

I can't walk so far and leave no

footprints; die and leave nothing

with my name on it.  I will not  be

known only for my failures.  And you

will not allow yourself to go down in

history as a lunatic.  You're too

smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr.

Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance

at redemption.  For both of us.

There's no time to equivocate, we

must seize it now, before --

LUDLOW

Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

LUDLOW (cont'd)

Did I interrupt something?

MALCOLM

Find someone else.

CUT TO:

LUDLOW

So, you two were just, uh, telling

old campfire stories, were you?

MALCOLM

Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a

second that you and I don't know the

truth.  You can convince Time

magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer

of whatever you want, but I was

there.

LUDLOW

You signed a non-disclosure agreement

before you went to the island that

expressly forbade you from discussing

anything you saw.  You violated that

agreement.

MALCOLM

You cost me my livelihood.  That on

which I relied to support my

children.

LUDLOW

If your university felt you were

causing it embarrassment by selling

wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly

see how I am to--

MALCOLM

I didn't tell anything, I told the

truth.

LUDLOW

You version of it.

MALCOLM

There are no versions of the truth!

This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's

my life.

LUDLOW

We made a generous compensatory offer

for your injuries.

MALCOLM

It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen

never--

LUDLOW

InGen is my livelihood, Dr.

Malcolm, and I will jealously defend

its interests.  People will know what

I want them to know when I want them

to know it.

LUDLOW (cont'd)

Don't forget that.

MALCOLM

Do you have a satellite phone?

CUT TO:

ROLAND

Ajay?

AJAY

(delighted)

How did you know?

ROLAND

(taps his nose)

That cheap aftershave I send you

every Christmas, you actually wear

it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit

down, what brings you to Mombassa?

AJAY

You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the

last time you answered your phone?

ROLAND

Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.

Why?

AJAY

I got a call from a gentleman who's

going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.

If he's to be believed, it's a most,

uh, unique expedition.  And very

well-funded.

ROLAND

Well, I'm a very well-funded old son

of a bitch.  You go.

AJAY

But alone?  We always had great

success together, you and I.

ROLAND

Just a little bit too much, I

think.

AJAY

How do you mean?

ROLAND

A true hunter doesn't mind if the

animal wins.  If it escapes.  But

there weren't enough escapes from you

and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend

a bit less time in the company of

death.  Maybe I just feel too close

to it my--

ROLAND (cont'd)

(to Ajay)

Excuse me.

ROLAND (cont'd)

You, sir -- are no gentleman.

TOURIST

Is that supposed to be an insult?

ROLAND

I can think of none greater.

TOURIST

Buzz off, you silly old bastard.

ROLAND

What do I have to do to pick a fight

with you, bring your mother into it?

TOURIST

Are you kidding?  I could take you

with one arm tied down.

ROLAND

Really?

TOURIST

I mean my arm.

ROLAND

Sorry.  We were saying?

AJAY

You broke that idiot's jaw for no

reason other than your boredom.  Tell

the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even

interested in knowing this

expedition's quarry?

ROLAND

Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a

look around the trophy room, and tell

me what kind of quarry you think

could possibly be of any interest

to me.

CUT TO:

SARAH

Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped

snout.

SARAH (cont'd)

They'll try to take down a calf.

Come on.

MAKENA

Closer?

MAKENA (cont'd)

You know, we could see everything

from up on the edge of that cliff.

SARAH

No way.

MAKENA

But the view would --

SARAH

No cliffs.

(into a pocket recorder)

F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking,

twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6

circling wide east.  Can't see F7.

MAKENA

Sarah.

SARAH

F8 circling north.  F1 straight

through, disrupting.  Herd moving,

stamping.  There's F7.  Straight

through.  F8 angling through from the

north.

MAKENA

Dr. Harding.

SARAH

Brooding behavior in evidence at the

kill site, pups are ushered forward

and adults help them eat, pulling

flesh away from the carcass and--

SARAH (cont'd)

(a frantic whisper)

I thought you turned it off!

SARAH (cont'd)

Yes?!

SARAH (cont'd)

Ian.  This better be important.

SARAH (cont'd)

When?

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

We leave in twenty-four hours.  Five

member team.

MALCOLM

Eddie Carr's handling all our

equipment and he'll be there to

maintain it.  He's designing special

field trailers now, top of the line

mobile research units.

EDDIE

No, no, look at the plans, Henry,

you can't place that strut laterally,

it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE

PLANS!

WORKMAN

Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't

deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test

it

MALCOLM

Any damage?

EDDIE

Minimal.

MALCOLM

"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be

light, it has to be strong --

EDDIE

Light and strong, light and strong,

sure, why not, it's only impossible.

God save me from academics.

MALCOLM

You are an academic.

EDDIE

Former academic.  Now I actually make

things.  I don't just talk.

MALCOLM

You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

EDDIE

(doesn't look at him)

It doesn't matter what I think.

MALCOLM

Is there anything we've forgotten?

Anything at all?

KELLY

Hi, Dad.

MALCOLM

Kelly!  What are you doing here?

KELLY

Vacation.  I'm all yours.  You didn't

forget, did you?

KELLY (cont'd)

Did you?

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

Okay, Karen is expecting you in half

an hour.  You only have to stay with

her one night, she'll put you on a

bus in the morning and your mother

will be at the station when you get

there.

KELLY

I don't even know this woman.

MALCOLM

Well, I do, and she's fantastic.

She'll take you to the museum, maybe

to a movie if you play your cards

right.  You're going to have a

fantastic time.

KELLY

Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you

going?

MALCOLM

I can't tell you.  But I'll be back

within a week.

KELLY

My vacation is over in a week.

MALCOLM

I'll make it up to you this summer.

I promise.

KELLY

I'm your daughter all the time, you

know.  Not just when it's convenient.

MALCOLM

Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you

to say that?

KELLY

No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own

once in a while.

EDDIE (o.s.)

Dr. Malcolm!

MALCOLM

Is that kid still bothering you?

KELLY

Which one?

MALCOLM

You know, at the bus stop.  With the

hair?

KELLY

That was about a year ago.

MALCOLM

Well, is he?

KELLY

No.  Richard talked to his parents.

MALCOLM

That Richard.

EDDIE (o.s.)

Ian, come here a minute!

KELLY

(to Malcolm)

I could come with you.

MALCOLM

Out of the question.  You'd miss the

gymnastics trials.  You've been

training for that for a year.

KELLY

I don't care about the trials, I

want to be with you.  I could be your

research assistant, like I was in

Austin.

MALCOLM

This is nothing like Austin.  Forget

about it.

KELLY

You like to have kids, you just

don't want to be with them, do you?

MALCOLM

I'm not like you wan me to be.  I've

what I can be.

DISSOLVE TO:

JUTTISON

(as the waves pound the

boat)

Couldn't -- we just -- airlift --

into the -- island?

MALCOLM

Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!

Helicopters are too disruptive.

These aren't piles of bones you'll be

studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they

live, they breathe, and they react!

SARAH

So what's your story, Nick?

NICK

I was a cameraman for Nightline for

six years, been freelance since '91.

Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

SARAH

That must be interesting.  What drew

you there?

NICK

Women.  'Bout eighty percent female

in Greenpeace.

SARAH

Very noble of you.

(of the noisy Game Boy)

You don't think you're bringing that

thing onto the island, do you?

NICK

Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the

woolly mammoths.

SARAH

You think this is all a joke?

NICK

Oh, please.  How am I supposed to

keep a straight face when --

(gestures to the

black-clad Malcolm)

-- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm

going to Skull Island?

SARAH

(not amused)

Ian's a very good friend of mine.

NICK

He doesn't need a friend, he needs a

shrink.

SARAH

I believe in him.

NICK

Come on, there's only one reason any

of us are here.  His check cleared.

SARAH

Drop the cynical pose.  You can't

pull it off while playing Donkey

Kong.

CAPTAIN

There it is!

CAPTAIN (cont'd)

Isla Sorna!

MALCOLM

Be back in three days, but keep the

satellite phone on and your radio

tuned to the frequency I specified in

case we need you sooner.

CAPTAIN

Don't worry.  I've lived around here

all my life, these islands are

completely --

CAPTAIN (cont'd)

-- safe.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

Listen.  I know you all have probably

concluded that I'm out of my mind.

MALCOLM (cont'd)

That's all right, for now.  But just

humor me and be careful.

MALCOLM (cont'd)

Even if you think I'm harmless and

deluded, I promise --

MALCOLM (cont'd)

-- this place is for real.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

EDDIE

Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a

subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

EDDIE (cont'd)

I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus

purpurascens, the South Sea cone

shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in

the world.  Acts within a

two-thousandth of a second.  Faster

than the nerve-conduction velocity.

The animal's down before it feels the

prick of the dart.

MALCOLM

(to Eddie)

Is there an antidote?

EDDIE

Like if you shoot yourself in the

foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be

dead  before you realized you'd

accidentally pulled the trigger.

NICK

Oh --

JUTTSON

-- my --

EDDIE

-- God!

SARAH

It's beautiful!

JUTTSON

Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,

infraorder Stegosauria, suborder

Thyreophora.  Length, adult male,

estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.

SARAH

(to Juttsn)

That was a pair bond!  A family

group, even, long after that infant

was nestbound!

JUTTSON

I want to see the nesting ground!

SARAH

Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't

see an egg clutch...

JUTTSON

(whispering back)

The empty shells are crushed and

trampled.  The young stay in the

birth environment, that's conclusive!

SARAH

Not without a shot of the nest.

NICK

She's gutty.

MALCOLM

She's nuts.

SARAH

Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so

glad!

JUTTSON

(out of breath)

Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you

an apology.

CUT TO:

SARAH

No more smoking.  We leave no scent

of any kind.  No hair tonics, no

cologne, seal all our food in plastic

bags.  We will observe and document,

but we will not interact.

MALCOLM

That's a scientific impossibility,

you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty

principle.  Whatever you study, you

also change.

NICK

What should I call this?  "Jurassic

Pork?"

SARAH

(still to Malcolm)

And let's forget about the high hide.

We can't do this kind of work up in a

tower, we need to be out in the

field, as close to the animals as

possible.

JUTTSON

I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in

a family group, but there's never

been anything in the fossil record to

prove the carnivores did.

SARAH

Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas,

jackals, nearly all species of

predator birds --

JUTTSON

That doesn't say a thing about T-rex,

they could have been rogues.  Robert

Burke certainly thinks they were.

SARAH

We've got to see one to find out.

Is there any --

MALCOLM

No way.

NICK

Oh, my God.

SARAH

-- way we could safely --

NICK

Oh, no!

EDDIE

Fire!

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

A campfire?!

SARAH

No!  Water mixes the smoke billow,

use dirt!

MALCOLM

Who the hell started a campfire?!

VOICE (o.s.)

It was just to make lunch.

KELLY (cont'd)

I wanted it ready when you got back.

MALCOLM

Oh ... man.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

You know you were putting yourself in

a potentially dangerous situation,

but you didn't bother to find out

how dangerous before you leapt in.

You don't have the faintest idea

what's going on on this island!

SARAH

(loading a backpack)

What do you want to do, Ian, lock her

up for curiosity?  Where do you think

she gets it?

JUTTSON

(to Nick)

Do you have chromium tapes?  The

others fog in high-

NICK

-humidity, I know.

(waving a tape)

Highest lead density on the market.

EDDIE

(to Malcolm)

We've got a lot of heavy marching

ahead of us.  I'm not carrying

anybody.

KELLY

I can keep up.

MALCOLM

You're going home.  I'm sending a

radio call for the boats.  We'll all

go down to the lagoon and wait for

them.

SARAH

Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a

high school vice-principal.

MALCOLM

I'm her father.

KELLY

Sure, now.

NICK

Do you see any family resemblance

here?

MALCOLM

You can't stay, Kelly, that's it.

It's too dangerous.

SARAH

If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring

any of us?

KELLY

You're wrong, Dad.  I do know

what's going on on this island.

MALCOLM

How could you possibly?

KELLY

Because you said so.  Maybe nobody

else believed you, but I always

did.

NICK

The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

SARAH

Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've

made two invasive landings in one

day.  That'll have to go in any paper

I write, and it will leave room for

people to say our findings were

contaminated.  You know the academic

world as well as I do, once they

smell blood in the water, you're

dead.  Our presence has got to be one

hundred percent antiseptic.  That

means if we bend a blade of grass, we

bend it right back the way it-

NICK

You were saying something about

antiseptic?

CUT TO:

LUDLOW

Welcome to your dream come true, Dr.

Burke.

BURKE

I believe the large herbivores forage

in open plains, like bison, which

would explain the great variety of

heat dots we're reading in the

flatlands around this waterhole.

Right -- here.

LUDLOW

Then that's where we're going.

BURKE

(calling them off)

Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!

Maiasaurus!

LUDLOW

This is as good a place as any for

base camp.  First priority is the

laser barriers, I want them all up

and running in thirty minutes.  Half

an hour, understand?

ROLAND

Cancel that, Dieter.

LUDLOW

What?  Why?

ROLAND

Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do

you want to set up base camp or an

all-you-can-eat people bar?

LUDLOW

(thinks)

You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new

spot.  And remember, we're after

herbivores only -- no unnecessary

risks.

ROLAND

Peter, if you want me to run your

little camping trip, there are two

conditions.  First -- I'm in

charge, and when I'm not around,

Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the

checks, tell us we're doing a good

job, and open your case of scotch

when we have a good day.  Second

condition -- my fee.  You can keep

it.  All I want in exchange for my

services is the right to hunt one of

the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck

only.  Why and how are my business.

If you don't  like either of those

conditions, you're on your own.  Go

ahead and set up your camp right

here, or in a swamp, or in the middle

of a rex nest, for all I care.  But

I've been on too many safaris with

rich dentists to listen to any more

suicidal ideas.  Okay?

LUDLOW

(what else can he say?)

Okay.

ROLAND

Good lad.

CUT TO:

BURKE

Pachycephalosaurus!

LUDLOW

Carnivore?

BURKE

(enchanted)

Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late

Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant

eater, see that distinctive domed

skull?  That's nine inches of solid

bone.

LUDLOW

(who cares?)

Just get them out of the way, Dieter.

DIETER

COME ON, MOVE IT!!

DIETER (cont'd)

Oh, for God's --

ROLAND

Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a

war.  Use your powers of persuasion.

DIETER

Come on, come on, don't have all

day!

BURKE

(going on to no one in

particular)

See, the pachy's neck attaches at the

bottom of its skull instead of the

back of its head, as with reptiles.

BURKE (cont'd)

So when it lowers its head, its neck

lines up directly with its

backbone --

AJAY

Roland.

BURKE

(concluding his lecture)

Which is perfect for absorbing

impact.

AJAY

It matches the pictures.

ROLAND

It certainly does.

ROLAND

HEY!

ROLAND (cont'd)

Don't worry about us.  We'll catch

up.

LUDLOW

Where do you think you're going?!

ROLAND

To collect my fee.

ROLAND

Ajay.

ROLAND (cont'd)

I'm no tracker, but even I can read

this spoor.

AJAY

Do you wish to go where the animal

has been, or where the animal is?

CUT TO:

EDDIE

Why didn't you tell us about these

guys, Ian?!

MALCOLM

Because I didn't know!  I don't have

the faintest idea what they're doing

here.

NICK

(angry)

Ruining everything, that's what

they're doing.  You could choke on

the diesel smoke already!

SARAH

Ian, nothing we observe will be valid

if we're trailing along in the wake

of an army.

KELLY

"InGen."  What's InGen?

MALCOLM

Where does it say that?

KELLY

On the side of that one truck.

JUTTSON

InGen is a genetics corporation,

isn't it?

NICK

(to Malcolm)

Is that who we're really working

for?!  Gene splicers?!

MALCOLM

No!  We're an independently funded

expedition.

SARAH

Funded by whom?

MALCOLM

John Hammond.

JUTTSON

But he's the head of InGen!

NICK

You gotta be kidding.

(to Malcolm)

You dragged me out of Greenpeace to

be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't

get anybody else?

KELLY

Yeah, what have you done, Dad?

SARAH

We'd better keep moving, or we'll

lose them.

MALCOLM

What are you doing to me, John?

CUT TO:

ROLAND

It's the rex nest.

AJAY

Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck

to return?

ROLAND

(shakes his head no)

If the nest is upwind, so are we.

When he comes back, he'll know we're

here before we have a chance.  The

truck --

ROLAND (cont'd)

-- is to get him to come where we

want him.

CUT TO:

HUNTER

LOOK AT THESE THINGS!

HUNTER 2

THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE

BEAUTIFUL!!!

DIETER

FASTER!

LUDLOW

Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!

LUDLOW (o.s.)

Those are very expensive animals!

Can you hear me?!

DIETER

(to the Driver)

Turn that off!

DIETER

Easy -- easy -- not too close!

Full extension!

DIETER (cont'd)

Now!

DIETER

Next case.

CUT TO:

JUTTSON

Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --

triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --

or small scavengers only.

MALCOLM

Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in

such a hurry for me to get here.  He

knew they were coming.

MALCOLM (cont'd)

You okay?

SARAH

(irritated)

Heights, I can't help it.  Put your

arm here, will you?

JUTTSON

What do they want?

MALCOLM

They want their money back.  To

InGen, this island is nothing more

than a bed investment.

JUTTSON

We should get back to base camp.

Eddie's waiting for us.

MALCOLM

I can't believe Peter Ludlow's

running all this.

SARAH

He isn't.  Check out the guy walking

past the fire.

SARAH (o.s.)

I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He

and that guy with him were

spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was

immoral to go after them any other

way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a

philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats

you up with your own argument.

SARAH (cont'd)

He's the one in charge.

MALCOLM

Well, if that's true -- the man in

charge just left camp.

NICK

Then this is our chance.

MALCOLM

Our chance to do what?

NICK

I don't know these guys, but I know

'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese

whalers, French barges trying to dump

barrels of nuclear waste in the North

Atlantic.  They're all the same.

They spray us with water cannon when

we try to stop 'em, sink our boats,

and then call us crazy.

NICK (cont'd)

Nobody has to come with me.  I've

done this before.

SARAH

Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger.

NICK

There' no reason for name calling.

MALCOLM

Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back

to camp right away.  Leave the other

car for us and we'll meet you there

in an hour or so.

KELLY

What are you guys gonna do?

MALCOLM

(signs)

Exactly what John Hammond wanted us

to do.

CUT TO:

ROLAND

Offering a little incentive.

LUDLOW

What kind of gun is that?

ROLAND

My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made

in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to

him after he took down his last

elephant.  8700 foot pound striking

force.

LUDLOW

How close do you have to be?

ROLAND

Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume

it'll take a slug in the brain case

to bring him down.

LUDLOW

Why not just use a scope and a poison

dart and snipe him from a hill?

ROLAND

Or a laser beam from a satellite?

LUDLOW

You rally think this'll draw the

parent?

ROLAND

I once saw a bull elephant die

charging a jeep.  All the jeep had

done was startle the bull's calves.

I saw a lioness carry wounded prey

four and a half miles, all the way

back to its den, just to teach its

cubs how to finish off a kill.

LUDLOW

Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.

ROLAND

Rex won't be any different.  It'll

come.

LUDLOW

You're kidding yourself.  An adult

T-rex cares about one thing --

filling its own belly.  It acts the

way people wish they could, that's

why everyone's fascinated by it.  If

people had the chance to see one

dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine

percent would --

LUDLOW (cont'd)

Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives...

growth inhibitors...

ROLAND

What?

LUDLOW

I hadn't planned on bringing

carnivores back because of the

liability risk, but I only thought of

adults, it never occurred to me --

(close to the animal)

You are a billion dollar idea, my

little f-

ROLAND

What the hell you do that for?!

LUDLOW

Had to.  To keep him still for the

trip.

ROLAND

You've broken its leg!

LUDLOW

We've got to transport it seven

thousand miles.  Would you prefer it

bit off the leg of a crew member?

CUT TO:

NICK

Hang on.  We may encounter some

turbulence.

BURKE

If you're really interested in

infants, we'll have better luck at

the seaside, because the sands offer

a cushioning surface where the egg

clutches can -- can --

ROLAND

What in God's -- !

ROLAND

Last time I leave you in charge.

NICK

Sick bastards.

LUDLOW

What in Christ's name is going on?!

ROLAND

Isn't it obvious?

NICK (cont'd)

We're not alone on this island.

CUT TO:

SARAH

Nick, thank God, we didn't know

if --

NICK

Wait, don't ---

MALCOLM

HOLY SHIT!!

ROLAND

Do we have anyone up there?

MALCOLM

?!

NICK

It has a broken leg!

MALCOLM

So do it a favor and put it out of

its misery!

NICK

No!  Get in the car before they hear

us!

CUT TO:

SARAH

Ian, close the window, it's going to

wake every predator in the jungle!

JUTTSON

There they are!

EDDIE

What is that they have with them?

MALCOLM

This is exceedingly unwise.

SARAH

Too late to worry about that!  Hold

him together, Nick!

MALCOLM

Just do whatever you have to do and

get it out of here as quickly as

possible.

SARAH

Okay, there's the metatarsals --

tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See

it?  That's a fracture, just above

the epiphysis.

NICK

That little black line?

SARAH

That little black line means death

for this infant.  The fibula won't

heal straight, so the ankle joint

can't pivot when he stands on his

hind feet.  The baby won't be able to

run, and probably can't even walk.

It'll be crippled, and a predator

will pick it off before it gets more

than a few weeks old.

MALCOLM

Can you set up?

SARAH

(thinking)

It has to be temporary, something

that'll break apart and fall off as

the animal grows...

MALCOLM

Think fast, Sarah.

KELLY

What are they doing?  Why don't

they hurry?!

EDDIE

Give me the radio.

NICK

Give it more morphine!

SARAH

We'll kill it with too much, we'll

put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm

almost done.  Damn it, I need

another adhesive, something pliable I

can --

SARAH (cont'd)

Spit!

KELLY

What is it?

EDDIE

Sarah, come in!

JUTTSON

It's moving.  Fast.

EDDIE (o.s.)

Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

SARAH

Hold it down, Nick!

NICK

I'm trying!

EDDIE (o.s.)

(from the radio)

Is anybody there?!

SARAH

Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin

and fill a syringe!  Quick injection

of antibiotics and I can get it out

of here!

EDDIE (o.s.)

(still from the radio, now

desperate)

SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME!

EDDIE (o.s.)

WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE

TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW!

EDDIE

WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED

IN YOUR DIRECTION!  I REPEAT --

MALCOLM

Oh, Christ.

MALCOLM (cont'd)

Let me talk to Kelly, is she--

NICK

What do they want?!

MALCOLM

What do you think they want?!

SARAH

That's impossible, they can't have

the sensory equipment to track it all

the way here!

MALCOLM

Current evidence seems to be to the

contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT

TO THEM!

SARAH

Ready?

NICK

Wait!

SARAH

(softly)

Born free, as free as the wind blows.

As free as the grass grows --

MALCOLM

Are you insane?!

SARAH

I swear to God, it works with lions

sometimes!  There we are -- your baby

is free --

EDDIE

They're going back into the jungle.

CUT TO:

EDDIE

Thank God.  Thank God.

MALCOLM (o.s.)

Kelly?  Are you all right?

KELLY

Uh huh.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

Wait there.  I'll come up in a

minute.  Don't move, understand?

KELLY (o.s.)

I understand.

SARAH

Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus

rex does nurture its young.

NICK

There's, uh -- there's an unwritten

rule when a news crew is in a war

zone.  You stop the van every two

miles and decide whether or not to go

on.  Whether or not you feel lucky.

One "no" from anybody in the group

and you turn around right there, no

question asked, nobody embarrassed.

(pause)

Well?  Do we go on?

SARAH

No.

MALCOLM

No.

NICK

No way.

MALCOLM

All right.  I'm satisfied with the

evidence we have right now.

I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will

too.

(to Sarah)

Do you have enough to publish?

SARAH

They will come after me.  But I can

collect some stool samples, for DNA

with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest

of you to back me up, it should stand

when we get back.

MALCOLM

(getting up)

Then the only thing left to do is

make sure we do get back.  I'll

call the mainland on the satellite

phone and have them send the boat

right now.  This expedition is over.

EDDIE (o.s.)

Oh, God.  I am so sorry.

MALCOLM

What the hell is he sorry f-

NICK

HANG ON TO SOMETHING!

SARAH

They're pushing us!

MALCOLM

Oh, God.

SARAH

What?!

MALCOLM

They're pushing us over the cliff.

NICK

SARAH!  DON'T MOVE!

SARAH

OH... GOD ... please...

MALCOLM

Nick!  Grab the phone!

NICK

SARAH LOOK OUT!

EDDIE

Hang on -- hang on --

EDDIE

HEY!  HELLO?!

MALCOLM

WE'RE IN HERE!  GET SOME ROPE!

EDDIE

Catch!

SARAH

We're sliding!

EDDIE

Climbs up if you can!

EDDIE

Damn it!

MALCOLM

(softly)

Eddie?

SARAH

Oh, God.  Now what?

MALCOLM

Are you all right?!  Anything broken?

KELLY

I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I

thought you, are you okay?!

MALCOLM

I'm fine... I'm fine...

ROLAND

(mostly to himself)

That's what you think.

CUT TO:

LUDLOW

Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go

to jail just for being here, did

you know that?

SARAH

Don't start a legal argument with me,

this island isn't your property, and

neither are these animals!

JUTTSON

What are you doing here, Burke?

There's no TV cameras, what's the

point?

BURKE

Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the

classroom.  I am amazed.

NICK

Are you looking for a problem?

JUTTSON

(an urgent whisper)

Everyone, keep your voices down!

ROLAND

Back off, Dieter.

JUTTSON

Listen to me, by moving the baby

rex into our camp, we changed the

adults' perceived territory!

LUDLOW

Their what?

SARAH

(she understands)

Oh, God.

JUTTSON

That's why they persisted in

destroying the trailers, they now

feel they have to defend this entire

area!  We're not safe here.

LUDLOW

(of Sarah and Nick)

Thanks to you people.

SARAH

Hey, we came here to observe, you

came here to strip-mine the place!

It's a looter mentality, all you care

about is what you can take.

ROLAND

None of that matters.  Our

communications equipment's been

destroyed.  If your radio and

satellite phone were in those

trailers that went off the cliff, and

I'm guessing by the look on his

face --

ROLAND (cont'd)

We are stuck here, ladies and

gentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

CUT TO:

ROLAND

If we can't stay in the rex's

territory, we have to move tonight.

SARAH

Move where?  Our boat's not coming

for two days, your airlift is waiting

for an order you have no way to

send --

LUDLOW

There's a communication center, here,

in the old worker village.  Hammond

put in some kind of renewable power

source replenishing.  It may still

work.  If we could get there, we

could send a radio call for the

airlift.

NICK

How far is the village?

LUDLOW

I said if we could get there.

NICK

Well, how far is it?

LUDLOW

A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not

the problem.

ROLAND

What is?

LUDLOW

The velociraptors.

LUDLOW (cont'd)

Our infrareds show their nesting

sites are concentrated in the island

interior.  That's why we planned on

keeping to the outer rim.

DIETER

What are velociraptors?

JUTTSON

Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six

feet long, three or four hundred

pounds, and very, very fast.

DIETER

I think we can handle ourselves

against them.

MALCOLM

No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

ROLAND

Look, we have two choices.  We can

hike back down to the lagoon, where

we can sit for two days, in the open,

next to a heavily used water source

while we're waiting for your boat to

arrive, or we can head for the

village, where we might find some

shelter and we can call for help.

MALCOLM

We'd never make it past the raptors.

Trust me, I have some experience in

this matter.

ROLAND

That may be.  But you weren't with

me at the time.

ROLAND (cont'd)

Load up.  Let's get this moveable

feast underway.

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

Damn it.

ROLAND

You all right?

ROLAND (cont'd)

Wrong question?

MALCOLM

You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

ROLAND

What's that?

MALCOLM

A statistical phenomenon.  Says

everything in the world goes in

streaks.  It's real, you see it

everywhere -- in weather, in river

flooding, in baseball, in blackjack,

in stock markets.  Once things go

bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad

things cluster.  They go to hell

together.

ROLAND

Feeling a bit blue, are we?

MALCOLM

Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

ROLAND

Why did you come here?

MALCOLM

So that others would know about this

place?

ROLAND

Why should they?

MALCOLM

Because it exists.

ROLAND

It'll still exit if they go on not

knowing, won't it?

MALCOLM

Yes.  And people will live in the

absence of truth.

ROLAND

So the truth is more important to you

than your life?

MALCOLM

(lowers is voice)

I don't care about my life.  But if

I'd ever thought for a second that

she would be in danger --

ROLAND

She yours?

MALCOLM (o.s.)

I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the

hell I'm doing with kids.  I never

should have had her.

MALCOLM (cont'd)

Why are you here?

ROLAND

Somewhere on this island, there

exits the greatest predator that

ever lived.  And the second greatest

predator must take him down.

MALCOLM

But why?

ROLAND

You remember that guy, about twenty

years ago, I forget his name, but he

climbed Everest without any oxygen,

came down almost dead.  And they

asked him, "why did you go up there

to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I

went up there to live."

MALCOLM

(nods)

It's called self-testing.  But in

your case, it sounds more like

self-destruction.  A uniquely human

characteristic.  In fact, human

beings destroy things so well that I

sometimes think that's our function.

Maybe every few sons, some animal

comes along that kills off the rest

of the world, clears the decks, and

lets evolution proceed to his next

phase.  Maybe death and destruction

are our job, maybe we're supposed

to destroy ourselves and every other

living thing that-

ROLAND

Tell you what.  You can see whatever

you want to, to me, but you will not

spew any more nihilist rants at

anyone else in the group.  I'm

fighting panic, and you push the

wrong buttons.  Understand?

CUT TO:

KELLY

I don't think -- my dad doesn't

think we're going to make it.

SARAH

Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more

than he knows.

NICK

I think you should call a break.

ROLAND

Another half hour.

NICK

Some of them won't make another half

hour.  We didn't come this far to

start dropping in the middle of the

jungle.  If you don't call it, I

will.

ROLAND

FIVE MINUTES BREAK!

JUTTSON

I can't believe you're still angry

about that.

BURKE

You know, it's very easy to criticize

the first person who studies

something.

JUTTSON

No, it's easy to criticize sloppy

research and hasty conclusions.

SARAH

You know, even if we do get those

tapes back, people are going to say

it's just another hoax.  Ian

Malcolm's alien autopsy.

MALCOLM

Maybe.  Maybe not.

SARAH

Ian, they will misplace our evidence,

shoot holes in our testimony, and say

some special effects genius created

the animals.  The only way people

will ever believe that dinosaurs

exist is if you dump a T-rex in the

middle of times Square.

SARAH (cont'd)

There's something more important that

you should be thinking about instead.

DIETER

Wait here for me, would ya Carter?

DIETER

It's not polite to --

DIETER (cont'd)

-- sneak up on people.

DIETER

HEY!  CARTER!  YELL OR SOMETHING, I

GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE!

DIETER (o.s.)

...Carter... me?...

DIETER

Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

ROLAND

Break's over, move on!

CUT TO:

ROLAND

How long ago was this?

CARTER

Seven, eight minutes.

ROLAND

Then he's dead.  Nobody tells the

little girl.  Last thing we need is

screaming hysterics.

SARAH

We have to send someone to look for

him!

ROLAND

You go if you like, but we're not

waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

You okay?

ROLAND

Looks like the worker village is down

in there, about a mile and a half

northeast from the base of these

cliffs.

MALCOLM

There must be a game trail, some kind

of path that goes down there.

ROLAND

They'll have to rest before we look

for it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.

Then we hit it.

CUT TO:

SARAH

There you are.  Your dad's looking

for you.

KELLY

I doubt that.

SARAH

Oh, come on.  Go talk to him.

KELLY

Why?  He likes to be alone.  I can

stay with you.

ROLAND

You hear something?

AJAY

No.  I feel something.

ROLAND

Oh, no.

ROLAND

(hisses)

ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

ROLAND

Get my weapon.

ROLAND

FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN!

MALCOLM

KELLY?  KEEEEELLLY?!

ROLAND

MALCOLM!  OVER HERE!

ROLAND (cont'd)

FASTER!!

MALCOLM

(shouting)

KELLY, UP HERE!

MALCOLM

I gotta get down there!

NICK

SARAH KELLY COME HERE!

SARAH

WHAT ARE YOU-

NICK

JUMP!

NICK

Shhhh... shhhh...

BURKE

Get out of the way!

SARAH

STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP

IT!

ROLAND

She's okay!  They'll stay in there,

she's okay!

AWAY

NO!  DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS!

ROLAND

Elephant grass!

HUNTER

They gave up!  They're not chasing

us!

CUT TO:

ROLAND

How many rounds did you find for that

weapon?

MALCOLM

Four, counting the one in the

chamber.

ROLAND

Don't let it out of your hands again.

(to Sara, but looking at

Kelly)

Can the kid walk?

SARAH

Ask her.

ROLAND

Can the kid walk?

KELLY

I can.  I can walk.

ROLAND

We're going to find a path down into

the interior of the island.  Load up

whatever you think you need, and I

mean need.  If you can't carry it

indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll

hit the worker village in a couple

hours and be out of here before dawn.

LUDLOW

What is that?

ROLAND

Piss.

CUT TO:

SARAH

God help us.

NICK

I do not feel lucky.

ROLAND

Keep moving.

LUDLOW

We made it!

MALCOLM

The jungle.  It's always ready to

return.

ROLAND

Where's the power and radio setup?

LUDLOW

Operations building.  Far end of the

street.

NICK

Lava?

MALCOLM

No.

NICK

What are they?

MALCOLM

I don't know.

LUDLOW

The radio rig is inside.  It runs

directly from the geothermal

generator, so power shouldn't be a

problem.

ROLAND

Good.

MALCOLM

What's he got in there?

LUDLOW

Piss.

SARAH

What?

LUDLOW

Don't ask me.  The guy's completely

out to lunch.

NICK

What in God's name would he want

with-

ROLAND

Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want

anything to do with it, and neither

does any other animal on this island.

This building is now demarcated as

the rex's territory.  As long as you

stay in that building, you'll all be

safe until the helicopter comes.

JUTTSON

Where are you going?

ROLAND

After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill

back in the valley with tyrannosaur

tracks all around it.  If I'm not

back in time, don't wait for me.

SARAH

You've got to be kidding.

ROLAND

Runs against my nature to hole up in

a cave and wait.

LUDLOW

Do you think the rex might have the

infant with it?

ROLAND

Possible.

LUDLOW

You know how to work a radio, don't

you?

SARAH

You're going too?

LUDLOW

I lost everything I came after on

this trip, but one T-rex in one theme

park could single-handedly bail

InGen out of Chapter 11.

LUDLOW (cont'd)

This is the broadcast frequency.  ID

yourself as "Harvest Leader."  You

know what to tell 'em.

MALCOLM

You gentlemen feel you have to do

this now?

ROLAND

Now's the perfect time.  The animal

just fed, so it won't stalk us for

food.  Predators don't hurt when

they're not hungry.

NICK

No.

NICK (cont'd)

Only humans do.

CUT TO:

NICK

(into microphone)

CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation

Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come

in, please.

VOICE (o.s.)

Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LUDLOW

We're downwind.  Good.

ROLAND

We took to the rock.

LUDLOW

Why?

ROLAND

Wind shift.

LUDLOW

It's... behind... us.

ROLAND

(the very softest whisper)

It's just fed.  It won't attack unless

it's threatened.  Don't move.

LUDLOW

If I don't move, I can't shoot it.

ROLAND

Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

ROLAND (cont'd)

NO!

CUT TO:

KELLY

What's going on?!

PILOT

There they are!

CO-PILOT

No LZ in the street, too much debris!

PILOT

Check the other buildings!

MALCOLM

There it is!

SARAH

Ian.  It's guano.

MALCOLM

What?

SARAH

These formations.  They're dried --

MALCOLM

Birdshit?

NICK

Who cares?  Let's go!

MALCOLM

Kelly?!  KELLY?!

CUT TO:

NICK

Come on!

MALCOLM

Where's Kelly?

NICK

She's with Sarah!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

We can't stay in here!

NICK

We're sure as hell not going back out

there"

MALCOLM

This is single-wall construction!

It's just a shack!

NICK

It'll hold!

MALCOLM

For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at

this!

(RAPS on the door with his

knuckles)

You could-

NICK

(helping him out)

Head for the roof!

MALCOLM

I have to find Kelly!

NICK

I think she's with Sarah!

MALCOLM

DAMN IT, BE SURE!!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MALCOLM

It's too wide!

NICK

Help me push this!

NICK

It's afraid to come onto the roof!

MALCOLM

Something's wrong.

NICK

Look!  Sarah!

MALCOLM

SHE'S ALONE!!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

EXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT

MALCOLM

Kelly!  KELLY!

CUT TO:

KELLY

We're snagged on something!

PILOT

Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut

'em with the rotors!

SARAH

NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

SARAH (cont'd)

They're protecting their nest.

That's all.  That's all they're

doing.

MALCOLM

Thank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank

God for you...

MALCOLM

Hello, Lex.  Tim.

MALCOLM (cont'd)

This is Kelly.  My daughter.

LEX

I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

MALCOLM

I'm sorry about your grandfather.

TIM

Thank you.

LEX

We were going to call you, in a few

days.  Tim and I have been thinking,

and we've decided we want people to

know about the island.  About what we

all saw.

TIM

We think it's something our

grandfather would want us to do.

MALCOLM

(pause)

Why?

LEX

Because it's true.

MALCOLM

I know, Lex.  But even if we're the

only ones who ever know, it'll still

be true.  You see, I've decided

that if the world found out about

what your grandfather created, it

wouldn't be around for very long.

LEX

But -- it was real.  You can't let

people go on saying it's not.

MALCOLM

That's the thing about reality.

MALCOLM (cont'd)

Even when people stop believing in

it, it doesn't go away.

MALCOLM (V.O.)

Do you feel the cold wind blowing on

your face?  That's real.

MALCOLM (V.O.)

Do you see the four of us, standing

here together, alive?  That's real.

MALCOLM (V.O.)

And maybe that's still that matters.

FADE OUT
