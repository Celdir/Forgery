INDEPENDENCE DAY

Dean Devlin & Roland Emmerich

CUT TO:

S.E.T.I. INSTITUTE, NEW MEXICO

SUPERVISOR

If this isn't an insanely

beautiful woman, I'm hanging up.

TECH ONE

Shut up and listen.

SUPERVISOR

God, I hope it's not just another

damned Russian spy job.

TECH THREE

(overlapping)

Negative.  Computer affirms the

signal is unidentified.

TECH TWO

(hanging up the phone)

The boy from Air Res Traffic say the

skies are clear.  No terrestrial

launches.

TECH ONE

It's the real thing.  A radio

signal from another world.

SUPERVISOR

Let's not jump the gun.  Run a

trajectory source computation.

SUPERVISOR (cont'd)

I want to know exactly where it's

coming from.

TECH THREE

This can't be right.

SUPERVISOR

What's wrong?

TECH THREE

Calculated distance from source is

at three hundred and eight five

thousand kilometers.

(turning to Supervisor)

It's coming from the moon.

CUT TO:

GENERAL GREY

Who else knows about this?

COMMANDING OFFICER

S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a

signal but they're even more

confused than we are.

COMMANDING OFFICER

Excuse me, Sir.

SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON

COMMANDING OFFICER

Satellite reception has been

impaired but we were able to get

these.

GENERAL GREY

Looks like a big turd.

COMMANDING OFFICER

We estimate it has a diameter of

over five hundred and fifty

kilometers and a mass roughly one

fourth the size of our moon.

GENERAL GREY

A meteor?

SECOND OFFICER

No Sir.  Definitely not.

GENERAL GREY

How do you know?

SECOND OFFICER

Well, er... it's slowing down.

GENERAL GREY

It's doing what?

SECOND OFFICER

It's... slowing down, Sir.

GENERAL GREY

Get me the Secretary of Defense.

(pause)

Then wake him up.

CUT TO:

WOMAN'S VOICE

(filtering through phone)

Hi. It's me.

WHITMORE

Hi honey.  What time is it there?

MARGARET

Two in the morning.  I

know

didn't wake you?

WHITMORE

(filtered)

As a matter of fact you did.

MARGARET

(smiles)

Liar.

WHITMORE

I have a confession to make.

There's a beautiful young blonde

sleeping next to me.

MARGARET

(filtered)

You didn't let her stay up

watching T.V. all night?

WHITMORE

Of course not.

PATRICIA

Mommy?

WHITMORE

You're flying back right after the

luncheon?  Okay, here she is.

PUNDIT #1

... the inexperience in public

office was inevitably going to

catch up with him.  He's

scarified his ideals for

"politics as usual."

PUNDIT #2

...I said this during the

campaign.  Leadership as a pilot

in the Gulf War has no

relationship to political

leadership.  It's a different

animal...

PATRICIA

(into phone)

Daddy let me watch Letterman.

WHITMORE

Traitor.

SECURITY GUARD

Good morning, Mr. President.

WHITMORE

Good morning, George.

WHITMORE

You're up early this morning,

Connie.

CONSTANCE

They're not attacking your

policies, they're attacking your

age.

(another paper; reading)

"...addressing Congress, Whitmore

seems less like the President and

more like the orphan child Oliver

asking, 'please sir, I'd like some

more.'"

WHITMORE

Clever.

CONSTANCE

Age was never an issue when you

stuck to your gun.  You were

thought of as young and

idealistic.  But the message has

gotten lost.  There's too much

compromise, too much politics.

WHITMORE

(pointedly)

Isn't it amazing how fast everyone

can turn against you.

CONSTANCE

Well, the Orange County Register

has named you one of the ten

sexiest men of the year.

WHITMORE

You see, substance at last.

CONSTANCE

Excuse me, Mr. President.  It's

the Secretary of Defense.

WHITMORE

Yes?  Say that again?

CUT TO:

MOISHE

What are you waiting?  My social

security will expire, you'll still

be sitting there.

DAVID

I'm thinking.

MOISHE

So think already.

MOISHE

Again he's thinking.

DAVID

You have any idea how long it

takes for those things to

decompose?

MOISHE

You don't move soon.  I'll begin to

decompose.

MOISHE (cont'd)

David, I've been meaning to talk

with you.  It's nice you've been

spending so much time with me,

but...

DAVID

Dad, don't start.

MOISHE

I'm only saying, it's been what?

Four years, you still haven't

signed your divorce papers.

DAVID

Three years.

MOISHE

Three, four.  Move on.  It's not

healthy.

DAVID

Look who's talking healthy.

MOISHE

How many times is that now?  You

trying

DAVID

Checkmate.  See you tomorrow, Dad.

MOISHE

That's

not

still... Oh.

(yelling after him)

You could let an old man win once

in a while, it wouldn't kill you.

CUT TO:

MARTY

What the hell is the point of

having a beeper if you don't turn

it on?

DAVID

It was

turned

you.  What's the big emergency?

MARTY

Started this morning.  Every

channel is making like it's

nineteen fifty.  Snow, static, all

kinds of distortions.  No one

knows what the hell is going on.

DAVID

Damn it, Marty.  There's a reason

we have bins labeled "recycle."

DAVID

What the hell is this?

MARTY

So sue me.

DAVID

Did you try to switch to

transponder channels?

MARTY

Please, would I be this panicked

if it was that simple?

DAVID

Let's retrofit the dish to another

satellite.

MARTY

We've tried.  It's not working.

It's almost as though they

weren't even there.

DAVID

That's impossible.

CUT TO:

WIDEN TO REVEAL:

MIGUEL

Stop it.

TROY

It's all fuzzy.

MIGUEL

You're gonna break it.  Just leave

it alone.  Here, take your

medicine.

TROY

I don't need it.

MIGUEL

(pushing it back)

Just take it, dick head.

(turning to his sister)

Alicia!  Make sure he takes his

medicine.

MIGUEL

Morning, Lucas.

LUCAS

You like these!  I've got a whole

goddamned crop full!

LUCAS (cont'd)

Where the hell is your father?

You know what time it is?

MIGUEL

He had to re-fuel.  There musta

been a problem.

LUCAS

We both know what the problem is.

He's a damned nut case, is what he

is.  I musta been out of my mind.

MIGUEL

Troy, stop it!  I swear to God!

LUCAS

Miguel, if he's not in the air in

twenty minutes, that's it.  I'm

getting someone else.

MIGUEL

Stop it, Troy!  I swear to God!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

AIDE #1

CNN is running a story that we're

covering up some kind of nuclear

testing experiments...

CONSTANCE

Tell them to run with it if they

want to embarrass themselves.

AIDE #2

NASA has been up my butt all

morning.  They want to know our

position.

CONSTANCE

Our official position is we don't

have an official position.

AIDE #3

Connie, what the hell

is

CONSTANCE

(smiles confidently)

Come on, people.  Would I keep you

guys out of the loop?

AIDE #1

In a second!

AIDE #2

Absolutely.

WIDE SHOT

SEC. OF DEFENSE

At the moment, our satellites are

somewhat unreliable.  Isn't it

possible that thing may just pass

us by?

NIMZIKI

What if it doesn't "pass us by?"

Let's retarget some ICBMs to blow

it out of the sky...

GENERAL GREY

Forgive me, but with the little

information we

do

thing that would accomplish is

turn one dangerous falling object

into many.

PRESIDENT WHITMORE

What's the damage?

CONSTANCE

The press is making up their own

stories at this point.

NIMZIKI

(to General Grey)

Get on the horn with Atlantic

Command.  Let's upgrade the

situation to DEFCON 3.

GENERAL GREY

That's not your call to make, Mr.

Nimziki.

CONSTANCE

Isn't that a little premature?

NIMZIKI

I don't think so.

SEC OF DEFENSE

We're two days away from the fourth

of July.  We have over fifty percent

of our armed forces on weekend leave,

not to mention the troops and

commanders we	have in town for the

Fourth of July	parade.  We call them

back now, we're sending up a major red

flag.

COMMANDING OFFICER

Our intelligence tells us the

object has settled into a

stationary orbit.

NIMZIKI

Well that's good news.

COMMANDING OFFICER

Not really.

COMMANDING OFFICER

Part of it has broken off into

nearly three dozen other pieces.

PRESIDENT WHITMORE

Pieces?

COMMANDING OFFICER

Smaller than the whole, yet over

fifteen miles in width themselves.

NIMZIKI

Where are they heading?

COMMANDING OFFICER

They should be entering our

atmosphere within the next twenty-

five minutes.

NIMZIKI

Like it or not, we're at DEFCON 3.

Recall the troops and put them on

yellow alert.

CUT TO:

MARTY

Please, tell me you're getting

something.

DAVID

There's good news and bad news.

MARTY

What's the bad news?

DAVID

You're in meal penalty for

disturbing my lunch.

MARTY

And the good news is you won't

charge me.

DAVID

No.  The good news is I found the

problem and it's not our

equipment.  There's some weird

signal embedded within the

satellite feed.

MARTY

That's the

good

DAVID

Yes, because the analog signal has

a definite sequential digital

patterns embedded within it.  When

I find the exact binary sequence

and I apply a phase reversed

signal to that calculated spectra

analyzer I built you last

Christmas, we should be able to

block out the overlay completely...

MARTY

...and we'll be the only guys in

town with a clear picture?  That's

my man.

CUT TO:

BI-WING AIRPLANE

MIGUEL

(yelling)

Russell!  God damn it, Russell!

MIGUEL

Just what the hell do you think

you're doing?

RUSSELL

(climbing down)

I'm bringing home the bacon.

Earning my keep.  And doing a fine

job if I do say so myself.

MIGUEL

It's the wrong field, you idiot!

Lucas' farm is on the other side

of town.

RUSSELL

You sure?

MIGUEL

Damn it, he was doing you a favor.

You know how hard it is to find

someone who doesn't think you're

completely crazy?

(MORE)

What are we supposed to do now?

Huh?  Where are we supposed to go

now?

Battle Carrier, USS Eisenhower - Persian Gulf

LIEUTENANT

Ensign, status?

SAILOR #1

We have a total radar black out

over a thirteen kilometer area.

LIEUTENANT

Have a complete diagnostic run...

SAILOR #1

Excuse me sir, radar may be

malfunctioning but infrared is off

the map!

LIEUTENANT

Get the CINC Atlantic Command on

the line.

CUT TO:

OFFICER

Sir, we now have visual range with

incoming over Iraqi airspace.

COMMANDING OFFICER

A second sighting?

OFFICER

Yes Sir, this just came in from

the Eisenhower.

COMMANDING OFFICER

Correction, we have

two

visual contacts.  One over Iraq,

one over the Pacific.

GENERAL GREY

Where in the Pacific?

(turning to the President)

They've spotted one off the

California coast line.

PRESIDENT

Put it on.

NEWSCASTER

(filtered)

...sightings of this atmospheric

phenomenon have been reported here

in Novosibirsk, Russia and other

parts of Siberia.  Moving too

slowly to be a comet or meteor,

astronomers are baffled as to its

origin...

NEWSCASTERS (cont'd)

(filtered)

...Widespread panic has gripped

the countryside as thousands have

taken to the streets and clogged

the highways.  Hundreds have been

injured...

GENERAL GREY

Mr. President, we have an AWAC on

the west coast.  E.T.A. with

contact point, three minutes.

RADAR TECH #1

(reporting into radio)

It's no use.  Side radar doesn't

see a thing!

RADAR TECH #2

(reporting)

That's correct.  We're IMC blind,

sir.

PILOT

Negative.  We still have

zero

visibility.

PILOT

(filtered)

Instrumentation is malfunctioning.

We can't get any kind of reading

on what's in front of us.

PILOT

Wait a minute, it may be clearing.

WALL OF FLAMES

Jesus God!  The sky's on fire!

GENERAL GREY

Get them back on line.

AIDE #1

(on other phone)

Line's gone, sir.

AAC CINC

Two more have been spotted over

the Atlantic.  One is moving

toward New York, the other is

headed this direction.

CHIEF OF STAFF

How much time do we have?

AAC CINC

Less than ten minutes.

NIMZIKI

(turning to aid)

Organize a military escort to

Crystal Mountain.

GENERAL GREY

(to President)

Sir, I strongly recommend we

move you to a secured location

immediately.

PRESIDENT

Can we expect the same kid of

panic here as in Russia?

CONSTANCE

More than likely.

NIMZIKI

Mr. President, you can discuss

this on the way.

PRESIDENT

I'm not leaving.

NIMZIKI

We must maintain a working

government in a time of crisis...

PRESIDENT

I want the Vice President,

Secretary of Defense, the whole

Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken

to a secured location.

I'm staying here.  I am

not

to add to a public hysteria that

could cost lives.

NIMZIKI

But, Mr. President...

PRESIDENT

So far these things have not

become hostile.  For the moment

let's assume they won't.

(to Constance)

Connie, let's issue statements

advising people not to panic, to

stay home and take cover.

GENERAL GREY

With your permission, Mr.

President, I'd like to remain my

your side.

PRESIDENT

I had a feeling you would.

GENERAL GREY

Sir, what happens if they

do

become hostile?

PRESIDENT

Then God help us.

CUT TO:

FEMALE CO-WORKER

(stopping in doorway)

David, are you watching this?

DAVID

I've got a lock on the signal

pattern.  We

can

MARTY

(distracted)

Huh?  Oh, good, hood.

DAVID

Strange thing is, if my

calculations are right it'll be

gone in approximately seven hours

anyway.  The signal reduces itself

every time it recycles.

Eventually it will disappear.  Are

you listening?

MARTY

(still glued to T.V.)

Can you believe this?

DAVID

What re you talking about?

MARTY

Haven't you been watching?

CONSTANCE

(filtered)

...so far the phenomenon has not

caused any damage.  In all

likelihood it won't...

CONSTANCE

...everyone should remain calm.

Take cover where you can but the

important thing is not to panic.

CONSTANCE

(filtered)

...we have a fix on three

different occurrences about to

appear over American cities.  One

is headed toward Los Angeles...

CONSTANCE

(filtered)

...the other two are on our

Eastern seaboard headed towards

New York and Washington, D.C...

CO-WORKER #2

Jamie says this building has an

old bomb shelter.  We're heading

down there now.

MARTY

Feel no shame in hiding.

MARTY

Oh shit, I better call my wife.

MECHANIC #1

Hey, Russ, heard you had a little

trouble this morning.  Dusted the

wrong field?

MECHANIC #2

I know, you're probably still a

little confused from your hostage

experience.

MECHANIC #2

Hostage experience?  Something

happen to you, Russ?

MECHANIC #1

He ain't never told you!?  Seems

years back our boy here had been

kidnapped by aliens.  Did all

kinds of experiments on him and

such.  Tell him, Russ.

RUSSELL

Not today, guys.  Okay.

MECHANIC #1

You just gotta get a couple more

beers in him, he'll tell you all

about it.  Crazy stuff.  Won't

you, Russ?

MECHANIC #1

Hey, Russ, when they took you up

in their space ship, they do any

sexual things to you?

Of course, Russia and the United

States are in this together.  Yes,

Yes, Das Vedanya.

I think he was drunk.

SECRET SERVICE GUY

Mr. President, we have to go.

It's too early, baby.

MAN

Earthquake?

JASMINE

Not even a four pointer.  Go back

CONSTANCE

What do we do now?

PRESIDENT WHITMORE

Address the nation.  There are a

lot of very frightened people out

there right now.

CONSTANCE

Yeah.  I'm one of them.

CUT TO:

JASMINE

He's trying to impress you.

STEVE

He's doing a good job.

STEVE

Neighbors are moving.  I think

they're tired of earthquakes.

NEWSCASTER

...with little damage reported to

the southland area.  People are

advised not to panic...

STEVE

Hon, something's on the table 'bout

the quake.

JASMINE

Tell her to get the kids and leave

town.

MARTY

What happened?

DAVID

(yells)

Just do it!

MARTY

Babycakes, pack the kids up and

take them to your mother's.  Don't

ask.  Go.

MARTY (cont'd)

Okay, why did I just send my

family to Atlanta?

DAVID

Remember I told you that the

signal hidden within our satellite

signal is slowly recycling down to

extinction.

MARTY

Not really...

DAVID

That signal.  It's a

countdown

.

MARTY

(confused)

A countdown to what?

DAVID

Think.  It's like in chess.  First

you strategically position your

pieces.  Then, when the timing's

right.  You strike.

BLITZER

...there are additional

unconfirmed sightings over Japan,

the Mediterranean, and China...

DAVID

They are positioning themselves

all over the world and using this

one signal to synchronize their

efforts.  In approximately six

hours the signal will disappear

and the countdown will be over.

MARTY

Then what?

DAVID

Checkmate.

MARTY

I gotta call my brother, my

bookie, my lawyer... fuck my

lawyer...

PRESIDENT WHITMORE

My fellow Americans, a historic

place.  The question as to whether

or not we are alone in the

universe has been answered...

PRESS AIDE

CONSTANCE

What do you want?

DAVID

(filtered)

You have to leave the White House.

CONSTANCE

This is not the time or the place

to have this same old discussion.

DAVID

You don't understand.  You have to

leave

Washington

CONSTANCE

In case you haven't noticed, we're

in a little bit of a crisis here.

DAVID

(filtered)

I've worked with embedded loading.

They're communicating with a

hidden signal.  They're going to

attack...

CONSTANCE

You're being paranoid.

DAVID

(filtered)

It's not paranoia.  The embedding

is very subtle.  It's probably

been overlooked...

PRESIDENT WHITMORE

(filtered)

...My staff and I are remaining

here at the White House while we

attempt to establish

communication...

PRESIDENT WHITMORE (cont'd)

...so remain calm.  If you are

compelled to leave these cities,

please do so in a safe and orderly

fashion.

STEVE

They cancelled it.  Why are you

acting like this?

JASMINE

Why?  That's why.  That thing

scares the piss out of me.

careful with them.

DYLAN

Cool.

Be careful.

works for the President.  They

know everything.

They don't know this.

And you're going to educate them?

Tell me something, you're so smart

how come you spent eight years at

M.I.T. to become a cable

NIMZIKI

This is crazy.  We're loosing our

JIMMY (cont'd)

Steve, listen to me, you're never

gonna get to fly the space shuttle

MOISHE

So, you want to ring the bell or

should I?

DAVID

Perfect, she's using it.

MOISHE

It's perfect the line is busy?

DAVID

Yes.  I can use he signal to

triangulate her exact position in

the White House.

MOISHE

You can do that?

DAVID

(sarcastic)

All cable repairmen can.

CONSTANCE

...Sally, take my cat with when

you leave.  No I'm staying here at

CONSTANCE

What?

DAVID

Connie, don't hang up.

CONSTANCE

David?  How'd you get this number?

Walk to the window.  Right in

front of you.

How does he do that?

MIGUEL

They let you out?

RUSSELL

Just what the hell do you think

you're doing?

MIGUEL

We're leaving, don't try and stop

us.

RUSSELL

You're not going anywhere.  You

hear me?  I'm still your father.

MIGUEL

No, you're not!  You're just the man

who married my mother.  You're

nothing to me!

RUSSELL

Troy's still my son no matter how

you feel about me.

MIGUEL

For once in your life think about

what's best for Troy.  Who has to

beg for money to buy him medicine

when you screw up?  Who?

TROY

Stop it!  I'm not a baby!  I don't

need your stupid medicine.  I

don't need anyone to take care of

me!

You know what this stuff costs?

Do you want to get sick again!?

Do you!?

GENERAL GRAY

They're in the air.

Very nice.

CONSTANCE

And when is the countdown supposed

DAVID

Fifty six minutes, forty five

seconds.

CONSTANCE

What do you want me to do?

DAVID

I want you to leave with us.

Right now.

CONSTANCE

I can't leave.  We have to tell

this to the President.

DAVID

He's not going to listen to me.

MOISHE

Sure he'll listen.  Why wouldn't

he?

DAVID

Because last time I saw him I

punched him in the face.

MOISHE

You punched the President in the

face?

DAVID

He wasn't the President then.

CONSTANCE

David thought I was having an

affair, which I

wasn't

.

MOISHE

Punched the President?  Oh my god.

PILOT

Echo one, we are closing in.

MOISHE

If I had known I was going to meet

the President, I'd a worn a tie.

Look at me, I look like a

schlemiel.

where all the bones are buried.

Comes in handy.

CONSTANCE

I'll bet.

PRESIDENT

What the hell's he doing here?

MOISHE

Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.

CONSTANCE

My ex-husband works in satellite

communications.

PRESIDENT

I don't have time for this...

DAVID

It's about "Line o sight," Mr.

President...

DAVID

...If you wanted t coordinate

with ships all over the world, you

couldn't send one signal to every

place at the same time.  That's

called line of sight...

DAVID (cont'd)

...you'd need to relay your signal

using satellites...

DAVID (cont'd)

...to reach each ship.  I have

found a signal hidden inside our

own satellite network.

ALEX

Excuse me, Mr. President.  They're

starting.

DAVID

Mr. President, they are using our

own satellites against us and the

clock is ticking.

PRESIDENT

General Grey, co-ordinate with

Atlantic Command.  Tell them they

have twenty five minutes to get as

many people out of the cities as

they can.

GENERAL GREY

But Mr. President...

PRESIDENT

And get those helicopters away

from the ship.  Call them back

immediately.

NIMZIKI

What the hell's going on?

PRESIDENT

We're leaving.

You will be the first wave in our

surveillance satellite

reconnaissance has been impaired,

we have a fix on our primary

You won't exactly need radar to

find it.

WATSON

You want to add something to this

briefing, Lt. Hill?

STEVE

Sorry, Sir.  Just real anxious to

kick some alien ass.

CONSTANCE

You saved a lot of lives.

PRESIDENT

I could have evacuated the cities

hours ago.

(beat)

You know, when I flew in the Gulf

War everything is simple.  We

knew what we had to do.  It's not

simple anymore, Connie.  A lot of

people died today.  How many

didn't have to?

PRESIDENT

Any news on my wife?

GENERAL GREY

The helicopter never arrived at

Nellis and there's been no radio

contact.

GENERAL GREY (cont'd)

The fighters are in the air.

GENERAL GREY

All satellites, microwave and

ground communications with the

cities are gone.  We believe we're

looking at a total loss.

Where are they?

DAVID

Moishe, please, don't talk.

MOISHE

Look at me, like a rock.  Good

weather, bad, doesn't matter.

We can go up and down, back and

forth, side to side...

MOISHE

CONSTANCE

He still gets air sick, huh?  In

all of this I didn't get the

chance to thank you two.

MOISHE

Think nothing of it, Spanky.

CONSTANCE

Spunky.  He told you about that?

MOISHE

(nods)

All he could think about was

getting to you.  There's still

love there I think.

CONSTANCE

Love was never our problem.

MOISHE

All you need is love.  John

Lennon.  Smart man.  Shot in the

heading this way.

RUSSELL

We should leave too.

MIGUEL

There's a group heading south,

they said there's a hospital just

a couple hours away.  I think we

should follow them.

PHILIP

Penicillin.  At least it will help

keep his fever down.

ALICIA

It's really nice of you to help

us.

I wish I could do more but we're

moving out.

ALICIA

(too eager)

We're going with you.  I mean,

we're going too.

PHILIP

Cool.

CUT TO:

TECHNICIAN

They must be targeting our

satellites.  We've lost all

satellite communication, tracking

GENERAL GREY

Have NORAD relay intelligence to

our on board computers?

GENERAL GREY

We've moved as many of our forces

away from the bases as possible

but we've already sustained heavy

losses.

NIMZIKI

I spoke with the Joint Chief when

they arrived at NORAD.  They

agree, we must launch a counter

offensive with a full nuclear

strike.  Hit 'em with everything

we've got.

PRESIDENT

Above American soil?

NIMZIKI

If we don't strike soon, there may

not be much of an America left to

defend.

GENERAL GREY

What's the latest from NORAD?

OFFICER

It's gone, sir.  They've taken out

NORAD.

NIMZIKI

That's impossible...

GENERAL GREY

My God, the Vice President and the

Joint Chiefs...

NIMZIKI

Mr. President, we must launch.  A

delay now would be more costly

than when you waited to evacuate

the cities!

DAVID

You can't be seriously considering

firing nuclear weapons?

CONSTANCE

David, don't...

DAVID

If you fire nukes, so will the

rest of the world.  Do you know

what that kind of fall out will

do?  How many innocent people...

GENERAL GREY

(stern)

Sir, i remind you that you are

just a guest here...

CONSTANCE

(overlapping)

David, please...

DAVID

This is insanity!  You'll kill us

and them at the same time.

There'll be nothing left!

NIMZIKI

(interrupting)

Sit down and shut up!

MOISHE

Don't tell him to shut up!  You'd

all be dead, were it not for my

David.  You didn't do anything to

prevent this!

PRESIDENT

Sir, there wasn't much more we

could have done.  We were totally

unprepared for this.

MOISHE

Don't give me unprepared!  Since

nineteen fifty whatever you guys

have had that space ship, the

thing you found in New Mexico.

DAVID

(embarrassed)

Dad, please...

MOISHE

What was it, Roswell?  You had the

space ship, the bodies, everything

locked up in a bunker, the what is

it,

Area fifty one

.  That's it!

Area fifty one.  You knew and you

didn't do nothing!

PRESIDENT

Regardless of what the tabloids

have said, there were never any

space crafts recovered by the

government.  Take my word for it,

there is no Area 51 and no

recovered space ship.

NIMZIKI

Uh, excuse me, Mr. President, but

that's not entirely accurate.

TALL MAN

The end has come!  He speaketh

his word and the end hast come!

PRESIDENT

Why the hell wasn't I told about

this place?

NIMZIKI

Two words, Mr. President.

Plausible deniability.

PRESIDENT

I don't understand.  Where did all

this come from?  How did this get

funded?

MOISHE

You didn't think they actually

spent ten thousand dollars for a

hammer and thirty thousand for a

toilet seat, did you?

MITCHELL

Mr. President, I'd like to

introduce you to Dr. Okun.  He's

been heading up our research here

for the last fifteen years.

OKUN

Mr. President, a real pleasure.

They don't let us out much, you

you.

PRESIDENT

(uncomfortable)

Yes.

OKUN

Well, I guess you'd like to see

the big tamale?  Follow me.

OKUN

She's a beaut, ain't she?

MOISHE

(smug)

Never any space ships recovered by

the government, huh?

PRESIDENT

We've had this for forty years and

you don't know anything about

them?

OKUN

Hell no, we know tons about them.

The nearest stuff has only

happened in the last few days.

OKUN (cont'd)

See, we can't duplicate their type

of power so we've never been able

to experiment.  But since these

guys started showing up, all the

gizmos inside turned on.  The last

twenty four hours have been really

exciting!

PRESIDENT

(exploding)

People are dying out there.  I

don't think "exciting" is the word

I'd choose to describe it!

PRESIDENT

(calming)

What can you tell us about the

enemy we're facing?

OKUN

Not all too dissimilar to us.

Breathes oxygen, comparable

tolerances to heat,

cold...probably why they're

interested in our planet.

(suddenly excited)

Hey, you wanna see them?

OKUN

This is vault, or as some of us

have come to call it, the "freak

show."

OKUN

When we found them they were

wearing bio-mechanical suits.

Once we got them off, we were able

to learn a great deal about their

anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar

digestive system... no vocal cords

though.  We're assuming they

communicate with each other

through other means.

DAVID

What kind of other means?  Hand

signals, body language?

OKUN

Some kind of extra sensory

perception.  Telepathy.

PRESIDENT

Can they be killed?

OKUN

These three died in the crash.

Their bodies are as frail as our

own.  You just have to get past

their technology, which is, I'm

sorry to say, far more advanced.

PRESIDENT

You unlocked a part of that

technology.  You cracked their

code.

DAVID

All I did was stumble onto their

signal.  I don't know how helpful

I can be...

PRESIDENT

Show them what you've discovered.

Work together.  We've got to find

a way to beat them.

GUARD

Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open

the gates without clearance.

STEVE

You want to see my clearance?

OKUN

See the gizmos flashing?

OKUN (cont'd)

We've been working around the

clock trying to get a fix on all

this crap.  Some stuff we figured

out right away.

OKUN (cont'd)

This thing we're pretty sure is

the life support for the cabin,

this do-hickey over here is

connected with the engines, this

crap...we have no idea what that

stuff is for.

OKUN (cont'd)

But this over here is clearly what

they use to navigate and guide the

craft.

DAVID

Someone grab my laptop for me?

OKUN

Find something interesting?

DAVID

Maybe.

DAVID

These patterns here, they're

repeating sequentially, just

like...

DAVID (cont'd)

...their countdown signal.  Their

using this frequency for computer

communications.  It's how they co-

ordinate their ships.

OKUN

You know, you're really starting

to make us look bad.

TECHY

(out of breath)

They got one!  They got one,

alive!

OKUN

How long has it been unconscious?

RUSSELL

Excuse me Doctor...

STEVE

Three hours.

OKUN

Get him into containment, stat.

RUSSELL

My boy is very sick, he needs

immediate attention.

OKUN

He's dying out.  I want him

sprayed down with saline.

RUSSELL

My boys is slipping into a diabetic

coma.  If you don't do something

about it right now he will die.

Take us to him.

anything about this when they

first arrived?  You could have

warned us before we launched a

fifteen percent, Sir.

if we screw this planet up enough

they won't want it anymore.

MOISHE

David, you're drunk.

MOISHE

I think you better sleep this off.

Go back inside before you catch a

cold.

DAVID

Pops, you're a genius!

MOISHE

What'd I say?

DAVID

A cold?  Of course.

CUT TO:

NIMZIKI

All right, Connie, we're here.

What's this all about?

CONSTANCE

I really have no idea.  He just

said to bring everyone down here.

DYLAN

Does that thing fly in outer

space?

STEVE

It certainly does.

DAVID

Could anyone please step back

away from the craft?

DAVID

Lt. Mitchell, would you mind

drawing your pistol?

MITCHELL

What?

DAVID

From where you're standing, do you

think you could shoot that can off

the alien craft?

DAVID

Sorry 'bout that.  You see, it's

protected by the craft's shields.

We can't penetrate their defenses.

NIMZIKI

We know that already.  What's your

point?

DAVID

My point is if we can't beat their

defenses, then we must get

around

them.

DAVID

Lt. Mitchell, would you please try

to shoot it again?

GENERAL GREY

How did you do that?

DAVID

I gave it a cold.

DAVID (cont'd)

More accurately, I gave it a

virus.  A computer virus.

GENERAL GREY

Are you telling us you can send

out a signal that will disable all

their shields?

DAVID

Just as they used our satellites

against us, we can use their own

signal against them.

DAVID (cont'd)

If we plant the virus directly

into the mother ship, it would

then filter down into all the

corresponding ships below.

NIMZIKI

And just how do we infect the

"Mother Ship" with a virus?

DAVID

We'll have to fly their craft out

of our atmosphere and dock with

the mother ship.

DAVID (cont'd)

We can enter here, upload the

virus and set off an explosion

that could disable it.  This would

disorient the smaller ship below

and buy you some time to take them

out.

NIMZIKI

This is ridiculous.

GENERAL GREY

How long would their shields be

down?

DAVID

Once they discover the virus it

could be a matter of minutes.

NIMZIKI

You want us to co-ordinate a

massive world wide counter strike

with a window of only a few

minutes?

GENERAL GREY

With their shields down it might

be possible.

NIMZIKI

Please, you're not buying into any

of this nonsense, are you?  We

don't have the manpower or the

resources to launch that kind of a

campaign.

(gesturing to the alien

ship)

Not to mention that this whole

cockamamie plan is dependent on a

machine that no one in the world

is qualified to operate.

STEVE (O.S.)

I wouldn't say that, sir.

STEVE

I've seen them in action.  I've

watched their maneuvers.  With

your permission, sir, I'd like the

opportunity to try.

NIMZIKI

That thing's a wreck.  It crash

landed back in the fifties!  We

don't even know if it's

capable

flying.

DAVID

Remove the clamps!

DAVID

Any other questions?

PRESIDENT

Let's do it.

NIMZIKI

I understand that you're upset

over the death of your wife but

that's no excuse for making

another fatal mistake...

PRESIDENT

The only mistake I made was

appointing a sniveling little

weasel like you Chief of Staff.

PRESIDENT (cont'd)

But this is a mistake, I am

thankful to say, I do not have to

live with.  Mr. Nimziki, you're

fired.

PRESIDENT (cont'd)

Organize every plane you can find

and get some Goddamned pilots

to fly them.

GENERAL GREY

Yes, Sir.

NIMZIKI

He can't do that.

CONSTANCE

(amazed)

He just did.

CUT TO:

REGINALD

...we've been told that there may

be additional re-enforcement in

hiding near the Golan Straights...

REGINALD

What the hell's he saying?

THOMSON

(explaining)

Seems they're getting a signal.

One Morse code.

REGINALD

I still get believe this.

THOMSON

The Iraqis don't appear altogether

too pleased with this arrangement.

REGINALD

How do you think the Israelis

feel?

THOMSON

It's from the Americans.  They

want to organize a counter

offensive.

REGINALD

It's about bloody time.  What do

they plan to do?

RUSSIAN #1

(subtitled)

They claims to be able to bring

down their shields.

RUSSIAN #2

When do they want to attack?

JAPANESE PILOT

(subtitled)

The attack begins in thirteen

hours.

CUT TO:

PRESIDENT

How're we doing?

GENERAL GREY

Better than we thought.

GENERAL GREY

We have confirmed divisions of

troops from different armies all

around the world.  Most of Europe,

the Middle East and Asia are

battle ready.

PRESIDENT

And our troops here?

GENERALE GREY

We've been collecting planes from

all over but...

PRESIDENT

But what, General?

GENERAL GREY

Pilots, sir.  We don't have enough

people to get them in the air.

PRESIDENT

Then find them.

CUT TO:

MIGUEL

How' he doing?

RUSSELL

Just fell asleep.  He's gonna be

just fine.  Join me in a little

celebration?

RUSSELL

Miguel.  Don't be mad.  Miguel!

OFFICER

(through megaphone)

...We're planning to launch a

counter offensive...

OFFICER (cont'd)

...with our depleted manpower we

must ask that anyone with any

flight experience come forward.

Military training is preferable

but anyone who can fly a plane

could be useful...

RUSSELL

(slurred)

I can fly, I mean, I'm a pilot.

OFFICER

Sorry, sir.

RUSSELL

You don't understand.  I've gotta

be part of this.  This is

important to me.  They ruined my

life.

OFFICER

Why don't you go somewhere and

sleep it off.

MITCHELL

We've hid the launcher in the

ship's manifold.

MITCHELL (cont'd)

This will be attached to the ships

main console.

STEVE

It's just like an AMRAAM launch

pad on the stealths.

MITCHELL

Exactly.  Use it the same way.

Only the nuke won't detonate on

impact.  You'll have another

thirty seconds to get as far away

as you can.

DAVID

I'll see how they're doing with

the radio transmitter.

STEVE

(checking his watch)

Oh shit, we're late.

DAVID

We'll meet you there.

CONSTANCE

Thirty seconds?  Isn't that

cutting it a little too close?

DAVID

We'll be well on our way out of

there before we shoot that thing

off.

TECHNICIAN

It's the strongest SHF transmitter

we could get.  It'll tell us when

you've uploaded the virus.

DAVID

Then cross your fingers the

shields go down.

CONSTANCE

With you?  I don't understand why

you can't just show someone how to

plant the virus, somebody trained

for this kind of mission?

DAVID

If anything goes wrong I'll have

to think quickly, adjust the

signal, who knows?

DAVID

(smiling)

You know how I'm always trying to

save the planet.  This is my

chance.

CONSTANCE

(to herself)

Now he gets ambitious.

DYLAN

It's too tight.

JASMINE

I had to borrow it.  I guess

that's good enough.

JASMINE

How do I look?

JASMINE

You're a lot of help.

JASMINE

You're late.

STEVE

You know me...

JASMINE

I know, you like to make a big

entrance.

STEVE

Before we do this, I want you to

know I'm sorry.

JASMINE

Sorry for what?

STEVE

(serious)

I should have done this a long

long time ago.

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Do you have the ring?

STEVE

You bet.

CHAPLAIN

Witnesses?

CHAPLAIN

Then let's get this show on the

road.

CUT TO:

GENERAL GREY

Beggars can't be choosers, sir.

PRESIDENT

Good morning.  In less than one

hour planes from here and all

around the world will launch the

largest aerial battle in the

history of mankind...

(beat)

Mankind.  The word has new meaning

for all of us now.  We are

reminded not of our petty

differences but of our common

interests.

PRESIDENT (cont'd)

Perhaps it's fate that today, July

the Fourth, we will once again

fight for our freedom.  Not from

tyranny, persecution or

oppression.  But from

annihilation.  We're fighting for

our right to live, to exit.  From

this day on, the fourth day of

July will no longer be remembered

as an American holiday but as the

day that all of mankind declared

we will not go quietly into the

night.  We will not vanish without

a fight.  We will live on.  We

will survive.

GENERAL GREY

Mr. President, just what do you

think you're doing?

PRESIDENT

I'm a pilot, Will.  This is where

I belong.

STEVE

When I'm back we'll light those

fireworks.

MOISHE

David, take these.

DAVID

Thanks, Pops.

MOISHE

I want you should know, I'm very

proud of you, son.

CONSTANCE

Be careful.

STEVE

Damn it.  We can't go yet.  I

gotta find some cigars.

MOISHE

My last two.  With my blessings.

STEVE

You're a lifesaver.

STEVE

Hang on to this.  For our victory

dance.  But not 'til we hear the

fat lady sing.

DAVID

I have a confession to make.  I'm

not real big on flying.

STEVE

Great.

STEVE

You ready?  Let' rock and roll.

STEVE

Oops.

STEVE

Let's try that again.

DAVID

What the hell are you doing?

STEVE

Just getting a feel for her.

PRESIDENT

Grey, you read me?

GENERAL GREY

(filtered)

Roger, Eagle One, our primary

target has shifted course.

PRESIDENT

(filtered)

Where's it headed?

GENERAL GREY

I think our secret is out.

They're headed right for us.

GENERAL GREY

(filtered)

ETA thirty six minutes.

STEVE

You still with me?

STEVE

(to himself)

I've waited a long time for this.

DAVID

That's it.  Head straight for it.

STEVE

Something's happening.  It's not

responding.

DAVID

(thrilled)

I was counting on that.  They're

bringing us in.

PRESIDENT

We have visual.

GENERAL GREY

(filtered)

Do not engage until we've

confirmed the package has been

delivered.

PRESIDENT

Roger.

CONSTANCE

What if that thing gets here

before we can plant the virus?

MITCHELL

The entire compound is buried deep

within the mountain.  It should

give us some protection.

CONSTANCE

But what about all the people

outside?

ALIEN TROOP PARADE GROUND

DAVID

Must be thousands of them.  What

are they doing?

STEVE

Looks like they're preparing the

invasion.

STEVE

This won't work.  They'll see

before we can do anything.

DAVID

These things are fully equipped.

Reclining bucket seats, power

windows...

DAVID

We're in!

MITCHELL

He's uploading the virus.

GENERAL GREY

(into mic)

Eagle One...

GENERAL GREY

(filtered)

...the package is being delivered.

Stand by to engage.

PRESIDENT

Roger.

PHILIP

Let me get that.

MIGUEL

Where's Russell?

CONSTANCE

Hurry, we've got to get everyone

inside.

DAVID

The virus is in.  All we can do

now is pray.

GENERAL GREY

(filtered)

Delivery complete.  Engage.

PRESIDENT

Roger.

GENERAL GREY

Keep your fingers crossed.

PRESIDENT

Come on, baby.

GENERAL GREY

It didn't work.  Disengage.  Sir,

get your people out of there.

PRESIDENT

Not yet!

GENERAL GREY

You did it!  A direct hit!

PRESIDENT

We're going in!  Squadron leaders,

take point.

MIGUEL

Russell!

DAVID

Get us out of here!

STEVE

I can't shake her free.

STEVE

What're you doing?

DAVID

It's not me.  They're overriding

the system.

STEVE

Damn!

surrounded

.

DAVID

Check and mate.

NIMZIKI

I'm not Jewish.

MOISHE

It's okay.

ALICIA

This could be our last night on

Earth.  I don't want to die a

virgin.

PHILIP

If we do, we'll both die virgins.

But at last we'll be together.

OFFICER

We're running out of missiles,

Sir.  We're just not causing

enough damage.

GENERAL GREY

(filtered)

They're getting ready to fire the

big gun.  You're going to have to

find a vulnerable spot, fast.

PRESIDENT

I've got an idea.  Keep 'em off my

tail.

PRESIDENT

Let's take 'em out before they

take us out.

PRESIDENT

I'm out of missiles!  Eagle 2?

EAGLE #2 PILOT

I'm on it.

GENERAL GREY

We're out of time.  Get out of

there!  Get as far away as you

can.

PRESIDENT

Doesn't anyone have any damned

missiles left?!

RUSSELL (O.S.)

Sorry I'm late, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT

(filtered)

Who is that?  What are you doing?

RUSSELL

(into mic)

It's okay, Sir.  I'm packin'.

RUSSELL

(filtered)

Just keep those guys off me for a

few more seconds.

RUSSELL

(filtered)

Do me one favor...

OFFICER

Who is that guy?

MIGUEL

Russell!

RUSSELL

(filtered)

...tell my children I love them

very much.

MIGUEL

(filtered)

Dad!  No!

RUSSELL

I've got to, kid.  You were always

better at taking care of them than

I was anyways.

GENERAL GREY

Let's get on the wire.  Tell every

squadron around the world how to

shoot those fuckers down.

STEVE

I guess there's nothing left to

do.  Let's nuke 'em.

DAVID

(re: cigar)

Funny, I always thought things

like

these

STEVE

Nice meeting you.

DAVID

You as well.

STEVE

Ready?

STEVE

Think they know what's coming?

DAVID

(still waving)

Not a chance in hell.

STEVE

We're loose!

DAVID

Doesn't matter.  Game's over.

STEVE

I don't hear no fat lady.

JASMINE

(to General Grey)

Any word from Steve?

JASMINE

You scared the hell out of me.

STEVE

Yeah, but what an entrance!

JASMINE

Dick-weed.

STEVE

Butt-munch.

CONSTANCE

Are you all right?

DAVID

Did it work?

CONSTANCE

You bet it did.

PRESIDENT

We're getting reports from all

over.  Their ships are going down!

STEVE

Didn't I promise you fireworks?

THE END
