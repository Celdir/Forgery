AVATAR

Written by

James Cameron

VOICE (V.O.)

When I was lying there in the VA

hospital, with a big hole blown through

the middle of my life, I started having

these dreams of flying.

VOICE (V.O.)

Sooner or later though, you always have

to wake up...

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

They can fix a spinal, if you've got the

money. But not on vet benefits, not in

this economy.

PERKY NEWSCASTER

The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a

century, is making a comeback. These

cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo

are...

2.

JAKE (V.O.)

I became a Marine for the hardship. To

be hammered on the anvil of life. I told

myself I could pass any test a man can

pass.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Let's get it straight up front. I don't

want your pity. I know the world's a

cold-ass bitch.

JAKE (V.O.)

You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong

planet. The strong prey on the weak.

3.

JAKE (V.O.)

It's just the way things are.   And nobody

does a damn thing.

JAKE (V.O.)

All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life

was a single thing worth fighting for.

CUT TO:

JAKE

I hope you realize you've just lost a

customer!

JAKE

(to himself)

Candy ass bitch.

JAKE

If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'!

4.

AGENT 1

Are you Jake Sully?

JAKE

Step off.    You're ruinin' my good mood.

AGENT 2

It's about your brother.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

The strong prey on the weak. A guy with

a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for

the paper in his wallet.

JAKE

Jesus, Tommy.

JAKE (V.O.)

The Suits' concern was touching.

AGENT 1

Your brother represented a significant

investment. We'd like to talk to you

about taking over his contract.

JAKE (V.O.)

The egghead and the jarhead.   Tommy was

the scientist, not me. He was the one

who wanted to get shot light years out

into space to find the answers.

5.

JAKE (V.O.)

Me -- I was just another dumb grunt

gettin' sent someplace I was gonna

regret.

DISSOLVE TO:

JAKE

(a hoarse whisper)

Are we there?

MED TECH

We're there, Sunshine.

MED TECH

People, you have been in cryo for five

years, nine months and twenty two days.

You will be hungry, you will be weak. If

you feel nausea, please use the sacks

provided for your convenience. The staff

thanks you in advance.

CUT TO:

7.

CREW CHIEF

Exopacks on!

CREW CHIEF

Remember people, you lose your mask

you're unconscious in 20 seconds and

you're dead in four minutes. Let's nobody

be dead today, it looks bad on my report.

CREW CHIEF

Exopack on, let's go!

8.

CREW CHIEF

Go directly into the base! Do not stop!

Go straight inside!

WAINFLEET

Look at all that new meat.

FIKE

Check it out, man.    Meals on wheels.

WAINFLEET

That is just wrong.

JAKE

What're you two limpdicks starin' at?

9.

WAINFLEET

Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a

wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up

in one.

MAN (V.O.)

You are not in Kansas any more...

CUT TO:

QUARITCH

... You are on Pandora, ladies and

gentlemen. Respect that fact every second

of every day.

10.

QUARITCH

Out beyond that fence every living thing

that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

wants to kill you and eat your eyes for

jujubees.

QUARITCH

We have an indigenous population of

humanoids here called the Na'vi. They're

fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin

which can stop your heart in one minute.

We operate -- we live -- at a constant

threat condition yellow.

QUARITCH

As head of security, it's my job to keep

you alive.    I will not succeed --

(pausing for effect)

-- not with all of you. If you wish to

survive, you need a strong mental

attitude, you need to follow procedure...

JAKE (V.O.)

Nothing like an old-school safety brief

to put your mind at ease.

CUT TO:

NORM

Hey, you're Jake right? Tom's brother?

You look just like him.

(off Jake's wary look)

Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman, I went through

avatar training with him.

11.

NORM

He was a great guy -- funny.     It was a

big shock to all of us.

JAKE

Yeah.

NORM

And duh! -- obviously you look like him.

I mean, if you weren't genetically

identical, you wouldn't be taking over

his avatar.

JAKE

That's why I'm here.

NORM

So -- you want to go check it out?

CUT TO:

MAX

Me and Norm were out here to drive these

remotely controlled bodies called

avatars. They're grown from human DNA

mixed with DNA from the natives here.

JAKE

Damn.   They got big.

12.

NORM

Yeah, they mature on the trip out.

(to Max)

So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty

well.

MAX

Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give

us a few hours, you guys can take them

for a spin.

JAKE

It looks like him.

NORM

No, it looks like you.   This is your

avatar now, Jake.

JAKE (V.O.)

The idea is -- every driver is matched to

his own avatar --

JAKE

-- so their nervous systems are in tune.

Or something. Which is why they offered

me this gig, because I can link with

Tommy's avatar, which was insanely

expensive.

(looking off camera)

Is this right? I just say whatever in

these videologs?

NORM

Yeah. You just need to get in the habit

of documenting everything -- what you

see, what you feel -- it's all part of

the science. Good science starts with

good observation.

13.

JAKE

Right.

(to camera)

So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science.

(looks around)

Never been in a lab before.

MAX

Log off. It's time to meet your boss for

the next five years.

CUT TO:

NORM

Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the

head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote

the book -- I mean literally wrote the

book -- on Pandoran botany.

MAX

(low, over his shoulder)

That's because she likes plants better

than people.

GRACE

(YELLING)

Who's got my goddamn cigarette?!

MAX

And here she is, Cinderella back from the

ball. Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm

Spellman and Ja --

GRACE

Norm. I hear good things about you.

How's your Na'vi?

14.

NORM

(Na'vi, subtitled)

May the All Mother smile upon our first

meeting.

GRACE

(SUBTITLED)

Not bad. You sound a little formal.

NORM

(SUBTITLED)

There is still much to learn.

MAX

Uh, Grace, this is Jake S----

GRACE

(turning to Jake)

Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I

don't need you. I need your brother.

(to Max)

You know -- the PhD who trained three

years for this mission.

JAKE

He's dead. I know it's a big

inconvenience to everyone.

GRACE

How much lab training have you had?   Ever

run a gas chromatograph?

JAKE

No.

GRACE

Any actual lab work at all?

JAKE

High school chemistry.   But I ditched.

GRACE

You see? You see? They're pissing on us

without even the courtesy of calling it

rain.

(turning away)

I'm going to Selfridge.

15.

MAX

Grace, that's not a good idea.

MAX

Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred.   Try to

use big words.

CUT TO:

GRACE

Parker, I used to think it was benign

neglect, but now I see you're

intentionally screwing us.

SELFRIDGE

Grace.   You know I enjoy our little

talks.

GRACE

I need a research assistant, not some

jarhead dropout.

SELFRIDGE

Actually, we got lucky with him.

GRACE

Lucky?   How is this in any way lucky?

16.

SELFRIDGE

Well -- lucky your guy had a twin

brother, and lucky the brother wasn't an

oral hygienist or something. A Marine we

can use. I'm assigning him to your team

as security escort.

GRACE

The last thing I need is another trigger

happy asshole out there!

SELFRIDGE

Look, you're supposed to be winning the

hearts and minds of the natives. Isn't

that the whole point of your little

puppet show? If you look like them, if

you talk like them, they'll trust you?

SELFRIDGE

But after -- how many years? -- relations

with the indigenous are only getting

worse.

GRACE

That tends to happen when you use machine

guns on them.

SELFRIDGE

This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

Because this little gray rock sells for

twenty million a kilo. No other reason.

This is what pays for the party. And

it's what pays for your science.

Comprendo?

SELFRIDGE

Those savages are threatening our whole

operation. We're on the brink of war and

you're supposed to be finding a

diplomatic solution. So use what you've

got and get me some results.

CUT TO:

17.

GRACE

How much link time have you logged?

NORM

Five hundred and twenty hours.

JAKE

Like -- an hour.

GRACE

Tell me you're joking.

JAKE

Don't!   I got this.

GRACE

So you just figured you'd come out here

to the most hostile environment known to

man, with no training of any kind, and

see how it went? What was going through

your head?

JAKE

Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling

me what I couldn't do.

18.

GRACE

Relax and let your mind go blank.    That

shouldn't be hard for you.

JAKE

Kiss the darkest part of my lily white --

MAX

Initiate link.

MAX

That's a gorgeous brain.     Nice activity.

GRACE

Go figure.

(walking away)

Alright, I'm going in.

TECH

Phase-lock at forty percent.    He's in

transition.

MAX

That's it.     Find your way home.

19.

MAX

He's in.

TECH

Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The link

is stable.

MAX

Take it slow, Jake. We need to check

your motor control. Try touching your

fingertips together --

MED TECH

Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down --

MAX

Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests --

20.

GRACE (O.S.)

Hey Marine!

JAKE

Grace?

GRACE

Well who'd you expect, numbnuts?   Think

fast!

GRACE

Motor control is looking good.

NORM (O.S.)

Hey, check it out.

NORM

I am a living god.

CUT TO:

21.

QUARITCH

For you pogues, this is a banshee. A

small one. See, they like it when I

bring fresh meat out here. And this

clearcutting really stirs up the hornet's

nest. So keep your head on a swivel. If

it moves, shoot it. If you're not sure

it's moving -- shoot it! If it looks like

a bunch of flowers you want to take home

to Sally Rottencrotch -- SHOOT IT!

What're you gonna do?

TROOPERS

Shoot it, sir!

QUARITCH

Outstanding. Let's roll.

22.

JAKE

That's kinda freaky.

GRACE

Lights out amigos.     See ya' at dinner.

GRACE

(looking down)

Damn. Same old sack a' bones.

CUT TO

23.

TRUDY

Sully -- Colonel wants to see you in the

Armor Bay.

CUT TO:

JAKE

You guys're packing some heavy ordinance.

TRUDY

Yeah, `cause we're not the only thing

flyin' around out there. Or the biggest.

I'm gonna need you on a door gun, I'm a

man short.

JAKE

Yeah, no problem.

TRUDY

See ya on the flight-line, zero nine.

(she points)

He's down there.

24.

QUARITCH

This low gravity makes you soft.

(pushing the last rep)

You get soft, Pandora will shit you out

dead with zero warning.

QUARITCH

I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela

-- that was some mean bush. Nothing like

this here, though. You got heart kid,

coming out here.

JAKE

I figured -- just another hellhole.

MECHANIC

That servo's in, Colonel, if you want to

try it.

QUARITCH

I was in First Recon a few years ahead of

you. More than a few. Two tours in

Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here

and --

QUARITCH

They could fix this if I rotated back.

But you know what? I kinda like it.

Reminds me every day what's out there.

Besides, I can't leave --

QUARITCH

This is my war, here.

25.

QUARITCH

The avatar program is a joke -- buncha

limpdick scientists. But we have a

unique opportunity here, you and I. A

recon Marine in an avatar body could get

me the intel I need, on the ground, right

in the hostiles' camp.

QUARITCH

Looks good.

(to Jake)

I need you to learn about these savages,

gain their trust. Find out how I can

force their cooperation, or hit `em hard

if they don't. Maybe you can keep some

of my boys from going home like you. Or

bagged-and-tagged.

JAKE

(NODDING)

That sounds real good, Colonel.   So -- am

I still with Augustine?

QUARITCH

On paper. You walk like one of her

science pukes, you quack like one, but

you report to me. Can you do that for

me?

QUARITCH

Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get

me what I need, I'll see you get your

legs back when you rotate home. Your real

legs.

26.

GRACE

Start calibrating. We're on the flight

line in ten minutes.

GRACE

What did Atilla want?

JAKE

Just Marines comparin' tattoos.

GRACE

(not buying it)

Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine --

GRACE

-- you're driving an avatar, now.     That

means you're in my world, got it?

JAKE

Got it.

GRACE

That son of a bitch has screwed up this

program enough. All this --

(indicating link room)

-- exists so we can go out there and

build a bridge of trust to these people,

who could teach us so much. But thanks

to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't

even talk to us anymore.

JAKE

Then how's this supposed to work?

27.

GRACE

We have a new face.

(turning to Norm)

You're fluent, you've studied the

culture. You're non-threatening. The

ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan --

may give you a chance. Maybe you can get

them back to the table before things go

tits-up for good.

NORM

This is failing as a pep talk.

JAKE

How do we contact them?

GRACE

We don't. They contact us. If they see

us taking our samples, treating the

forest with respect --

(pointedly to Jake)

Not trampling everything in sight --

they may reach out to us.

JAKE

Or they may skin us and make a drum.

GRACE

Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do

the talking.

CUT TO:

28.

TRUDY (INTERCOM)

Sturmbeest herd, one o'clock.

GRACE

Looks like a bull, six cows and some

juveniles.

NORM

The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?

WAINFLEET

Yo Chacon!     Get some!

CUT TO:

29.

GRACE

Stay with the ship.

(for Jake)

One idiot with a gun's enough.

WAINFLEET

Whatever you say, Doc.

WAINFLEET

(LAUGHING)

Ya'll have fun out there.

GRACE

Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

30.

NORM

How will they know we're here?

GRACE

I'm sure they're watching us right now.

CUT TO:

GRACE (O.S.)

The kids were so bright, so eager to

learn... they picked up English faster

than I could teach it to them.

GRACE

Bring the soil probe -- right there,

yellow case.

GRACE

(WISTFULLY)

The stingbats knock them off. I guess I

always hope somebody will come back and

read them.

NORM

Why don't they come back?

GRACE

(GRIMLY)

The Na'vi learned as much about us as

they needed to know.

31.

JAKE

(turning to her)

What happened here?

GRACE

(SHARPLY)

Are you going to help with this gear?

We've got a lot to do.

CUT TO:

GRACE

See, right here where the roots of the

two trees interact.

GRACE

Don't shoot. You'll piss it off.

32.

JAKE

It's already pissed off!

GRACE

Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

GRACE

It's a territorial threat display. Do not

run, or he'll charge.

JAKE

What do I do?

GRACE

Hold your ground!

JAKE

Oh yeah!   Who's bad?! That's right.

JAKE

That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch!

33.

JAKE

That's right motherf--

JAKE

What about this one?       Run, don't run?

What?

GRACE

Run.     Definitely RUN!

34.

CUT TO:

35.

CUT TO:

TRUDY (INTERCOM)

I'm going to have to call it, guys. We're

not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's

orders.

36.

GRACE

Shit.

TRUDY

Sorry, Doc. He's just gonna have to hang

on `till morning.

GRACE

He's not going to make it till morning.

CUT TO:

37.

JAKE

(SCREAMING)

I don't have all goddamn night! Come on!

Come on!

38.

NEYTIRI

Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!

NEYTIRI

Raaaarrrr!

JAKE

Wait, don't --

39.

NEYTIRI

(in Na'vi)

Forgive me, my brother.

JAKE

Look, um, I know you probably don't

understand this. But -- thanks. Thank

you. I owe you.

NEYTIRI

(in Na'vi)

Forgive me. May your spirit run with the

Great Mother.

JAKE

I would have been screwed if you hadn't

come along --

JAKE

Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'?

JAKE

Slow down a second will you. I just want

to thank you for killing those --

40.

NEYTIRI

Don't thank! You don't thank for this!

This is sad. Very sad, only.

JAKE

Okay, I'm sorry.    Whatever I did -- I'm

sorry.

NEYTIRI

All this is your fault! They did not need

to die.

JAKE

They attacked me.   How'm I the bad guy

HERE--

NEYTIRI

Your fault! You are like a baby, making

noise, don't know what to do. You should

not come here, all of you! You only come

and make problems. Only.

JAKE

Okay, fine, you love your little forest

friends. So why not just let them kill

my ass? What's the thinking?

NEYTIRI

Why save you?

JAKE

Yes, why save me?

NEYTIRI

You have a strong heart.   No fear.

41.

NEYTIRI

But stupid! Ignorant like a child!

JAKE

If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should

teach me.

NEYTIRI

Sky people can not learn.   You do not

See.

JAKE

Whooaa.

JAKE

Then teach me to "see."

NEYTIRI

No one can teach you to See.

JAKE

Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just

got off on the wrong foot and --

42.

JAKE

--you just have to get to know me. I'm

Jake. Jake Sull--

JAKE

Whooaaa -- shit!

JAKE

I need your help.

NEYTIRI

You should not be here.

JAKE

So take me with you.

NEYTIRI

No. You go back.

JAKE

(off her amazed look)

What?

JAKE

What are they?

43.

NEYTIRI

Atokirina'. Seeds of the Great Tree --

very pure spirits.

JAKE

What was that all about?

NEYTIRI

Come!

CUT TO:

JAKE

What's your name?

44.

NEYTIRI

(SUBTITLED)

Tsu'tey, what are you doing?! He is my

captive!

TSU'TEY

(SUBTITLED)

These demons are forbidden here. I will

kill this one as a lesson to the others!

NEYTIRI

(SUBTITLED)

Stop! There has been a sign. This is a

matter for the Tsahik.

TSU'TEY

(SUBTITLED)

Bring him.

CUT TO:

45.

EYTUKAN

(SUBTITLED)

Why do you bring this creature here?

NEYTIRI

(SUBTITLED)

I was going to kill him, but there was a

sign from Eywa.

EYTUKAN

(SUBTITLED)

I have said no dreamwalker will come

here, to offend our home! His alien

smell fills my nose

46.

NEYTIRI

(SUBTITLED)

Father, many atokirina came to this

alien.

JAKE

What's going on?

NEYTIRI

My father is deciding whether to kill

you.

JAKE

Your father!?

(to Eytukan)

Uh, good to meet you, sir.

MO'AT

(NA'VI)

Step back!

MO'AT

(SUBTITLED)

I will look at this alien.

NEYTIRI

That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one

who interprets the will of Eywa.

JAKE

Who's Eywa?

47.

MO'AT

(thick accent)

What are you called?

JAKE

Jake Sully.

MO'AT

Why did you come to us?

JAKE

I came to learn.

MO'AT

We have tried to teach other Sky People.

It is hard to fill a cup which is already

full.

JAKE

My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask

Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist.

MO'AT

What are you?

JAKE

I don't know. I was a Marine -- uh, a

warrior. Of the Jarhead clan.

TSU'TEY

(SUBTITLED)

A warrior! I could kill him easily!

EYTUKAN

(SUBTITLED)

No! This is the first warrior

dreamwalker we have seen. We need to

learn more about him.

JAKE

What's going on?   What are they saying?

MO'AT

(to Neytiri, subtitled)

Daughter. You will teach him our way, to

speak and walk as we do.

48.

NEYTIRI

(SUBTITLED)

Why me? That's not fair!     I only--

MO'AT

(SUBTITLED)

It is decided!

MO'AT

(to Jake)

My daughter will teach you our ways.

Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if

your insanity can be cured.

MO'AT

(SUBTITLED)

He is your responsibility.

JAKE

So it's all good, right?   You and me --

NEYTIRI

Do not speak.

CUT TO:

JAKE

Don't get up.

JAKE

You never told me your name.

49.

NEYTIRI

Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

JAKE

Okay, again, a whole lot slower.

NEYTIRI

(exaggerated slowness)

Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.

JAKE

Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree.

TSU'TEY

(SUBTITLED)

These aliens try to look like people, but

they can't.

MO'AT

(SUBTITLED)

He seems dim to me.   And his eyes are too

small.

JAKE

Your mom likes me.    I can tell.

MO'AT

(SUBTITLED)

Neytiri will test this "warrior." Hey may

learn nothing -- but we will learn much.

EYTUKAN

You speak truth. We must understand

these Sky People if we are to drive them

out.

JAKE

These rock. What are they?

NEYTIRI

Teylu. You call beetle larvae.

50.

JAKE

That's some damn fine teylu. That's like

grandma's teylu.

TSU'TEY

(SUBTITLED)

I say she will kill him.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GRACE

Come on back, kid, that's it.

JAKE

Wha --? Oh.

GRACE

Damn, you were dug in like a tick.

(she helps him sit up)

Is the avatar safe?

JAKE

(huge grin)

Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to

believe where I am.

CUT TO:

51.

GRACE

-- so the kid's out there one night and

he's got the Queen Bitch herself offering

him the spare room and the car keys.

Unbelievable.

JAKE

It's not something you can teach.

MAX

That's awesome, Jake.

GRACE

(to Jake, getting serious)

For reasons I cannot fathom, the

Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us

all.

CUT TO:

QUARITCH

Jarhead clan?

(he laughs)

And that worked?

JAKE

(GRINNING)

Yeah. They want to study me.   See if I

can learn to be one of them.

QUARITCH

That's how you seize the initiative. I

wish I had ten more like you.

SELFRIDGE

Look, Sully -- find out what these blue

monkeys want.

(MORE)

52.

SELFRIDGE (cont'd)

We try to give them medicine and

education. Roads! But no -- they like

mud. I wouldn't care except --

SELFRIDGE

Their damn village is sitting right over

the richest unobtanium deposit for a

hundred klicks in any direction. Which

sucks -- for them -- because they need to

relocate.

JAKE

(taking that in)

Does Augustine know about this?

SELFRIDGE

Yeah, she does, and she's on the next

ship back if she tries to cock-block me

on it.

JAKE

So -- who talks them into moving?

QUARITCH

(TURNING)

Guess.

JAKE

What if they won't go?

QUARITCH

(ICY)

I'm betting they will.

SELFRIDGE

Killing the indigenous looks bad, but

there's one thing shareholders hate more

than bad press -- and that's a bad

quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to

get them to move, or it's going to have

to be all stick.

QUARITCH

You got three months.    That's when the

dozers get there.

JAKE

I'm on it.

CUT TO:

53.

JAKE

Tsu'tey.

(next photo)

Mo'at.

(next photo)

Eytukan.

GRACE

He's the clan leader --

(indicating Mo'at)

-- but she's the spiritual leader.   Like

a shaman.

JAKE

Got it. So who's this Eywa?

NORM

Who's Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The

Great Mother. The goddess made up of all

living things. You'd know that if you

had any training whatsoever.

JAKE

Who's got a date with the chief's

daughter?

GRACE

Knock it off. Jesus, it's like

kindergarten around here.

GRACE

Neytiri was my best student. She and her

sister Silwanin. Just amazing girls.

JAKE

I didn't meet the sister.

54.

GRACE

(QUIETLY)

No, she's dead.

(turning to him)

Okay, let's go -- village life starts

early.

MAX

Link is ready.

GRACE

Don't do anything unusually stupid.

CUT TO:

55.

NEYTIRI

This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel her

heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong

legs.

NEYTIRI

You may tell her what to do --

(she touches her head)

-- inside. For now, say where to go.

JAKE

Forward.

NEYTIRI

Again.

TSU'TEY

You should go away.

56.

JAKE

(to Neytiri)

I knew this guy could speak English.

TSU'TEY

(SUBTITLED)

This alien will learn nothing.   A rock

Sees more.

NEYTIRI

Again.

CUT TO:

JAKE

You've got outer columns, then a

secondary ring here, and an inner ring.

Then a core structure, it's like a

spiral, that's how they move up and down.

QUARITCH

I'm going to need accurate scans of all

these columns.

JAKE

Roger that.

CUT TO:

GRACE

I'm not about to let Quaritch and

Selfridge micro-manage this thing.

(she looks pointedly at Jake)

We're going up into the mountains.

(MORE)

57.

GRACE (cont'd)

There's a mobile link up at Site 26 that

we can work out of.

NORM

The Hallelujah Mountains?

GRACE

That's right.

NORM

Yesssss!

(off Jake's look)

The legendary Floating Mountains of

Pandora? Heard of them?

CUT TO:

TRUDY

It only takes tiny inputs.   Here, put

your hand on the cyclic --

TRUDY

Feel how small the moves are? You barely

have to think it, and the aircraft

reacts.

GRACE

See these magnetic formations.   We're

getting close.

TRUDY

Yeah we are. Look at my instruments.

58.

GRACE

Yup. We're in the flux vortex.

NORM

Oh. My. God.

TRUDY

You should see your face.

JAKE (V.O.)

Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace

explained it to me -- some kind of maglev

effect because unobtanium is a

superconductor, or something. At least

somebody understands it. Just not me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

59.

GRACE

Jake, take number two, it's the least

glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate

Jake's link.

JAKE

Hey. You got a problem?

NORM

I trained three years for this mission.

I speak the language fluently.

(he points at Jake)

He falls off the frickin' turnip truck

and all of a sudden he's cultural

ambassador!?

GRACE

It's not our choice, Norm.

NORM

Yeah, well I didn't come out here to wash

the dishes while you're on some

interspecies booty call.

GRACE

He can't go far.

60.

GRACE

Let's get you in.

CUT TO:

JAKE

Holy shit.

NEYTIRI

Do not look in her eye.

NEYTIRI

Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is

made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter

in the whole life.

61.

NEYTIRI

To become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must

choose your own ikran. And he must choose

you.

JAKE

When?

NEYTIRI

When you are ready.

NEYTIRI

Heeyaaahh!

CUT TO:

JAKE

Do I have to do this?   I need some rack.

GRACE

No -- now, when it's fresh.

JAKE

Yeah, yeah.

(to camera)

The days are starting to blur together.

The language is a bitch, but I figure

it's like field-stripping a weapon.

Repetition.

62.

JAKE

Seyri.

JAKE

Ontu, mikyun, nari.

JAKE (V.O.)

Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard.

JAKE (V.O.)

Norm's attitude has improved lately.

NORM

Thank you?

JAKE

Ireiyo.

NORM

Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo.   You've gotta roll

the R, r-r-r-oll it.

JAKE (V.O.)

It's good he's back on board, but he

thinks I'm a retard too.

JAKE (V.O.)

My feet are getting tougher.   I can run

farther every day.

63.

JAKE (V.O.)

I have to trust my body to know what to

do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die.

JAKE (V.O.)

I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and

Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes

me coffee before link every morning.

GRACE

(Na'vi, subtitled)

I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite.

NEYTIRI

I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.

64.

JAKE (V.O.)

I'm learning to read the trails, the

tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest

scents and sounds.

NEYTIRI

When you hear nothing, you will hear

everything. When you see nothing, you

will See everything.

JAKE (V.O.)

Sometimes I have no idea what she's

talking about.

JAKE (V.O.)

It's been a month and I'm still not

allowed to make a kill. She says the

forest hasn't given permission.

JAKE (V.O.)

There's a lot of crap like that. She's

always going on about the flow of energy--

the spirits of the animals and what not --

65.

JAKE

(SMIRKING)

I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on

the final.

GRACE

(without looking up)

This isn't just about eye-hand

coordination out there. You need to

listen to what she says. Try to see the

forest through their eyes.

JAKE

Excuse me -- this is my video-log here,

okay?

66.

JAKE (V.O.)

Everything is backwards now. Like out

there is the true world, and in here is

the dream.

JAKE

(NA'VI)

I See you Brother, and thank you. Your

spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays

behind to become part of the People.

NEYTIRI

A clean kill. You are ready.

CUT TO:

GRACE

You're still losing weight.   Here --

JAKE

I made a kill today. We ate it.   I know

where that meal came from.

67.

GRACE

Other body. You need to take care of

this body.

JAKE

Yeah yeah.

GRACE

Jake, I'm serious -- you look like crap.

You're burning too hard.

JAKE

Get rid of this shit, then you can

lecture me.

GRACE

I'm telling you, as your boss and someone

who might even consider being a friend

someday, to take some down time.

JAKE

Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.

GRACE

Yeah -- you're gonna go ride a banshee.

Or die trying.

JAKE

That's right, Grace. This is what I've

been working for.

GRACE

And this is your check up from the neck

up, Marine. You're getting in way too

deep.

(she turns away)

Trust me, I learned the hard way.

JAKE

What did happen at the school?

68.

GRACE

Neytiri's sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped

coming to school. She was angry about

the clear-cutting.

GRACE

One day, she and a couple of other young

hunters came running in, all painted up --

they'd set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess

they thought I could protect them.

GRACE

The troopers pursued them to the

schoolhouse.

GRACE

They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.

Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the

others.

(MILDLY)

I got most of the kids out, before they

shot me.

JAKE

Jesus.

GRACE

Yeah.

GRACE

A scientist stays objective -- we can not

be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten

years of my life into that school. They

called me sa'atenuk. Mother.

(turning to him)

That kind of pain reaches back through

the link.

GRACE

It's a job. Learn what you can -- but

don't get attached.

69.

GRACE

It's not our world, Jake.   And we can't

stop what's coming.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway

to heaven. It's the test every young

hunter has to pass.

JAKE

We doin' this?

CUT TO:

70.

71.

TSU'TEY

Jakesully will go first.

NEYTIRI

(WHISPERING)

Now you choose your ikran. This you must

feel -- inside. If he also chooses you,

move quick, like I showed. You will have

one chance.

JAKE

How will I know if he chooses me?

NEYTIRI

He will try to kill you.

JAKE

Outstanding.

JAKE

Let's dance.

72.

JAKE

That's right! You're mine.

NEYTIRI

First flight seals the bond. You cannot

wait.

JAKE

Heeeyyyaaaah!

73.

JAKE

Shut the hell up!!

JAKE

Level out!     Fly straight!

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

I may not be much of a horse guy.   But I

was born to do this.

74.

CUT TO:

75.

CUT TO:

GRACE

The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial

predator. Not only rare, but the

sightings tend not to get reported.

TRUDY

There usually isn't time to key the mike.

JAKE

The People call it Toruk.

NORM

(TRANSLATING)

Last Shadow.

JAKE

Last one you ever see.

TRUDY

I saw one take out a gunship once --

WHAM! Total frickin' yard sale. Ate the

crew like peanuts.

JAKE

That's it.

GRACE

Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls.

It's their most sacred place.

76.

GRACE

Something big is going on in there,

biologically. I'd die to get samples, but

outsiders are strictly forbidden.

TRUDY

They're coming back.

TRUDY

If you don't give him something, he's

gonna shut us down.

JAKE

Hey, guys.

CUT TO:

NEYTIRI

My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk

Macto -- Rider of Last Shadow. Toruk

chose him. It has only happened five

times since the time of the First Songs.

JAKE

That's a long time.

NEYTIRI

Toruk Macto was mighty -- he brought the

clans together in a time of great sorrow.

All Na'vi people know this story.

77.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

78.

GRACE

Watch that stuff.   It'll knock you into

next week.

TSU'TEY

I thought -- enough drink -- you would

not be so ugly.

JAKE

Sorry.

TSU'TEY

Your warriors -- hide inside machines --

fight from far away.

(he looks at Jake)

I did not think a sky person could be

brave.

NEYTIRI

You must dance! It is the way.

79.

MO'AT

(SUBTITLED)

We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is

with Tsu'tey.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

It's hard to put in words the deep

connection the People have to the forest.

JAKE (V.O.)

They see a network of energy that flows

through all living things. They know that

all energy is only borrowed--

JAKE (V.O.)

-- and one day you have to give it back.

80.

JAKE (V.O.)

Hard to believe it's only been three

months.

JAKE

(to the lens)

I can barely remember my old life. I'm

not sure who I am anymore.

CUT TO:

SELFRIDGE

Good of you to stop by. How's it going

out there? Our blue friends all packed

up yet?

SELFRIDGE

See, I keep hooking it.   It's the damn

pack.

SELFRIDGE

The low gravity and the high air density

cancel out so --

JAKE

You called us back to report -- you want

to hear it or not?

SELFRIDGE

Go ahead.

GRACE

Jake is making incredible progress, years

worth in just a few months. But -- we

need more time.

81.

SELFRIDGE

Not what I was hoping to hear.

GRACE

Parker, it's their ancestral home.

They've lived there since before human

history began. You can spare them a few

more weeks.

SELFRIDGE

This thing is inevitable. What does it

matter when it happens? I'm sorry, Dr.

Augustine. You're out of time.

CUT TO:

QUARITCH

You're not gettin' lost in the woods, are

you son?

QUARITCH

Your last report was two weeks ago. I'm

starting to doubt your resolve. From what

I see, it's time to terminate this

mission.

JAKE

No.    I can do this.

QUARITCH

Look, you've given me plenty of usable

intel. Like this "Well of Souls" place --

I've got them by the balls with that,

when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it

will.

82.

QUARITCH

So you'll get your legs back, like I

promised.

(puts his hand on Jake's

SHOULDER)

It's time to come in.

JAKE

I've gotta finish this thing. There's

one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It's the

final stage of becoming a man. Then I'm

one of them. They'll trust what I say...

JAKE

... and I can negotiate the terms of

their relocation.

QUARITCH

Then you need to get it done, Corporal.

CUT TO:

GRACE

Jake, I can't allow this.   You're just

not strong enough.

JAKE

It's the last door -- I'm going through

it. You can help me or get out of the

way.

GRACE

(grabbing him)

Will you listen to me? Sometimes the

Na'vi themselves die in these vision

quests. The venom takes you to the edge

of death.

(MORE)

83.

GRACE (cont'd)

And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm-

- we have no idea what that'll do in an

avatar brain.

NORM

Calibrating. Thirty seconds.

GRACE

No matter what you prove out there-- you

are still in here.

(shaking him)

Right here.

JAKE

I have to go all the way -- become one of

THEM--

GRACE

(FURIOUSLY)

Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of

them!

GRACE

Our life out there takes millions of

dollars of machinery to sustain. You

visit -- and you leave.

GRACE

(SOFTENING)

You can never truly be with her.

JAKE

You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch

sent me.

NORM

What?

84.

JAKE

That's right -- to embed with the

Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them

out of their home. By deceit or by

force, he didn't care. And if it turned

out to be force, then how best to do it.

GRACE

And what about now, Jake?

JAKE

I'm not that guy any more.

GRACE

I know.

JAKE

But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he

yanks me out -- I never see her again.

And if I tell her the truth, the clan

throws me out -- that's if they don't cut

my heart out and show it to me.

NORM

They won't understand what you've done.

JAKE

They don't even have a word for "lie" --

they had to learn it from us.

GRACE

I know. I taught it to them.

JAKE

(PLEADING)

Grace. I've gotta go.   They're waiting.

NORM

Link is ready.

85.

GRACE

Jake. You can't carry this burden much

longer.

JAKE

(smiling wanly)

It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind

probably can't survive the Dream Hunt

anyway.

GRACE

(to Norm)

Prep my link. I'm going in.

CUT TO:

NEYTIRI

When your Spirit Animal comes, you will

know.

MO'AT

(SUBTITLED)

Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree --

bless this worthy Hunter with a true

vision.

86.

87.

MO'AT

It is finished.

EYTUKAN

(SUBTITLED)

Did your Spirit Animal come?

MO'AT

(to Jake)

Something has come.

(to the others, subtitled)

It will take time for the meaning to be

clear.

88.

EYTUKAN

(SUBTITLED)

You are now a son of the Omaticaya.   You

are part of the People.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

89.

NEYTIRI

This is a place for prayers to be heard.

And sometimes answered.

JAKE

It's like -- a sound you feel.

NEYTIRI

We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of

Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who

live within Eywa.

NEYTIRI

You are Omaticaya now. You may make your

own bow from the wood of Hometree.

(she looks away)

And you may choose a woman.

NEYTIRI

We have many fine women. Ninat is the

best singer --

JAKE

I don't want Ninat.

NEYTIRI

There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter --

JAKE

I've already chosen. But this woman must

also choose me.

90.

NEYTIRI

She already has.

NEYTIRI

Kissing is very good. But we have

something better.

JAKE

Neytiri, you know my real body is far

away, sleeping.

NEYTIRI

This body is real.

(she touches his forehead)

This spirit is real.

NEYTIRI

When I was first your teacher, I hated

all Sky People. But you have also taught

me.

(WHISPERING)

Spirit is all that matters.

91.

NEYTIRI

I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for

life.

JAKE

We are?

NEYTIRI

Yes. It is our way.

(INNOCENTLY)

Oh. I forgot to tell?

JAKE

Really, we are?

NEYTIRI

We are.

JAKE

It's cool. I'm there.

CUT TO:

92.

NEYTIRI

Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come

back to me now. Jake!

GRACE

Here -- eat this. I'd hate to have to

force-feed a cripple.

GRACE

(GRINNING)

She's not going anywhere.

GRACE

And when was the last time you took a

shower? Jesus, Marine.

93.

JAKE

Hey!    Heeeey! Stop! Stop!

OPERATOR

Hey, I got one of the natives blockin' my

blade here.

SUPERVISOR

(to Selfridge)

What do we do?

SELFRIDGE

Roll on. He'll move. These people have

to learn that we don't stop.

OPERATOR

I'm blind.

94.

QUARITCH

Freeze it, right -- there.

SELFRIDGE

Son of a bitch!

QUARITCH

Get me a pilot!

CUT TO:

95.

EYTUKAN

(SUBTITLED)

Tsu'tey will lead the war party!

GRACE

(SUBTITLED)

Please -- this will only make it worse --

TSU'TEY

You do not speak here!

JAKE

(to Neytiri, low)

Okay, listen. There's something I have to

tell you. It's gonna be hard. I just

need you to --

TSU'TEY

You!

TSU'TEY

You mated with this woman?!

GRACE

Oh shit.

MO'AT

Is this true?

NEYTIRI

(SUBTITLED)

We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

96.

TSU'TEY

(SUBTITLED)

Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is

changing. Everything is being destroyed!

TSU'TEY

(SUBTITLED)

These aliens kill everything they touch,

like poison.

MO'AT

Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can

never be Tsahik. Your life will be

wasted.

NEYTIRI

I have chosen.

TSU'TEY

Yeeeeeaaa!

EYTUKAN

(SUBTITLED)

Stop! This is not a proper challenge.

TSU'TEY

I challenge you.

GRACE

Jake, don't --

JAKE

I accept.

CUT TO:

97.

TRUDY

Loveshack this is Samson One Six inbound

hot to your pos. I have Colonel Quaritch

with me and --

QUARITCH

Did I tell you to announce us?

TRUDY

Sorry sir, it's procedure.

NORM

Samson One Six?   Trudy?

(no answer)

Crap.

GRACE

What the hell are you doing?

JAKE

It's the only way to get him to goddamn

listen.

98.

NORM

Hey, hang on, you can't interrupt a link

in progress, it's dangerous -- wait!

JAKE

Are you out of your goddamn mind?!

QUARITCH

You crossed a line.

99.

TSU'TEY

(SUBTITLED)

This is a demon in a false body. It

should not live.

CUT TO:

QUARITCH

You let me down, son. You got a little

local pussy and completely forgot what

team you play for.

GRACE

Parker, listen, there may still be time

to --

QUARITCH

Shut your fucking hole!

100.

GRACE

Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot

me?

(to Selfridge)

You need to muzzle your dog!

SELFRIDGE

Can we just take this down a couple

notches, please.

JAKE

(to Quaritch)

You say you want to keep your people

alive. Start by listening to her.

GRACE

(to Selfridge)

This is bad, Parker. Those trees were

sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you

can't imagine.

SELFRIDGE

You know what? You throw a stick in the

air around here it falls on some sacred

fern.

GRACE

I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here --

I'm talking about something real and

measurable in the biology of the forest.

SELFRIDGE

(FRUSTRATED)

Which is what exactly?

GRACE

(to Jake)

I can't do this. How am I supposed to

reduce years of work to a sound bite for

the illiterate?

JAKE

Just tell him what you know in your

heart.

101.

GRACE

Alright, look -- I don't have the answers

yet, I'm just now starting to even frame

the questions. What we think we know --

is that there's some kind of

electrochemical communication between the

roots of the trees. Like the synapses

between neurons. Each tree has ten to the

fourth connections to the trees around

it, and there are ten to the twelfth

trees on Pandora --

SELFRIDGE

That's a lot I'm guessing.

GRACE

That's more connections than the human

brain. You get it? It's a network -- a

global network. And the Na'vi can access

it -- they can upload and download data --

memories -- at sites like the one you

destroyed.

SELFRIDGE

What the hell have you people been

smoking out there? They're just.

Goddamn. Trees.

GRACE

You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth

of this world isn't in the ground -- it's

all around us. The Na'vi know that, and

they're fighting to defend it. If you

want to share this world with them, you

need to understand them.

QUARITCH

We understand them just fine.   Thanks to

Jake here.

JAKE (RECORDED)

They're not going to give up their home --

they're not gonna make a deal. For what?

Lite beer and shopping channel? There's

nothing we have that they want. We're a

horror to them. We're the monsters from

space.

102.

JAKE (RECORDED)

They're never going to leave Hometree.

QUARITCH

Since a deal can't be made -- it gets

real simple.

(to Jake, icily)

So thanks. I'm getting all emotional.    I

might just give you a big wet kiss.

GRACE

Parker, we have to talk, like rational

people.

SELFRIDGE

Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately

you're out of here on the next shuttle.

All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar

Program, effective now.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

WAINFLEET

They hit with banshees first. Set the

ampsuit on fire. Driver's toast.

QUARITCH

The rest of the squad?

WAINFLEET

Six bodies -- that's all of `em. And the

equipment is totalled.

SELFRIDGE

Christ.

103.

QUARITCH

I can do it with minimal casualties to

the indigenous. We'll clear them out

with gas first. It'll be humane. More or

less.

QUARITCH

Hey, don't go limp on me now. This is

exactly the incident we needed.

SELFRIDGE

Alright, let's pull the trigger.

CUT TO:

GRACE

They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose,

to trigger a response. They're

fabricating this war to get what they

want.

NORM

I can't believe that.

JAKE

Yup. That's how it's done. When people

are sitting on shit you want, you make

them your enemy. Then you're justified in

taking it.

TRUDY

Sec-ops is rolling the gunships.   They're

gonna hit Hometree!

JAKE

When?

TRUDY

Now.    We're spooling up now! I gotta go.

104.

GRACE

My God.

GRACE

Parker, wait. Stop! These are people

you're about to --

SELFRIDGE

They're fly-bitten savages who live in a

tree! Look around -- I don't know about

you but I see a lot of trees. They can

move.

GRACE

For God's sake, there are children in

there. Babies!

JAKE

Look Selfridge, you don't want this kind

of blood on your hands. Let me try to

talk them out. They trust me.

CUT TO:

SELFRIDGE

You've got one hour. Unless you want

your girlfriend in there when the axe

comes down, you get them to evacuate. One

hour.

CUT TO:

105.

JAKE

(SUBTITLED)

Eytukan, I have something to say, to

everyone.

EYTUKAN

(SUBTITLED)

Speak, Jakesully.

JAKE

(SUBTITLED)

A great evil is upon us. The Sky People

are coming to destroy Hometree. They

will be here soon.

JAKE

(SUBTITLED)

You have to leave, or you will die.

MO'AT

Are you certain of this?

JAKE

They sent me here to learn your ways. So

one day I could bring this message, and

you would believe it.

NEYTIRI

What are you saying, Jake? You knew this

would happen?

JAKE

Yes.

(ANGUISHED)

At first it was just orders. Then

everything changed. I fell in love--

with the forest, with the Omaticaya

People --

(he looks at her)

-- with you. And by then, how could I

tell you?

NEYTIRI

I trusted you, Jake!

106.

JAKE

Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to --

NEYTIRI

You will never be one of the People!

NEVER!

TSUTEY

(SUBTITLED)

Bind them.

CUT TO:

QUARITCH

Well, I'd say diplomacy has failed.

QUARITCH

I think they mean to cut their throats if

we don't back off. Make sure you get a

nice close-up of that. I can tack it onto

the after-action report.

107.

JAKE

You have to get out of Hometree! Run to

the forest! Please, I'm begging you!

EYTUKAN

(SUBTITLED)

Take the ikran! Attack from above!

QUARITCH

Alright, let's get this done. Give me

forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the

front door.

GUNNER

Roger.   CS forties. Going hot.

QUARITCH

Fire.

EYTUKAN

(yelling/subtitled)

Everybody outside! Go to the Forest.

108.

MO'AT

You are one of us.   Help us!

JAKE

We've gotta move!    He's gonna blow the

columns.

QUARITCH

That's how you scatter the roaches. Okay,

switch missiles. Give me H-E's at the

base of the west columns.

PILOTS (V.O.)

Copy, switching missiles.

TRUDY

Screw it.

109.

QUARITCH

Bring it down.

QUARITCH

Nice work people. Alright, let's light

it up.

JAKE

Neytiri!   Neytiri!

110.

EYTUKAN

(SUBTITLED)

Daughter -- take my bow. Protect the

People.

JAKE

I'm sorry --

NEYTIRI

Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never

come back!

JAKE (V.O.)

I was a warrior who dreamed he could

bring peace. Sooner or later though, you

always have to wake up...

SELFRIDGE

Pull the plug.

111.

MO'AT

(SUBTITLED)

Bring her.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

GRACE

They never wanted us to succeed.

TRUDY

Personally I think steak's too good for

these traitors.

GUARD

They get steak?    That's bullshit. Let me

see that --

112.

TRUDY

Oops.

(shoving him down)

All the way down, pendejo.

MAX

That was unexpectedly satisfying.

NORM

Baby, you rock.

JAKE

(to Max and Trudy)

Thanks.

JAKE

So what do you say?    Time for a

revolution?

GRACE

I'm free.

JAKE

Come on.

CUT TO:

113.

JAKE

(to Trudy)

Get your ship fired up.

JAKE

Stay here. I need somebody on the inside

I can trust.

CUT TO:

TROOPER

I need you to shut down and step out of

the vehicle! Now!

JAKE

Take it nice and easy, troop.

JAKE

On the ground, face down. Hands behind

your head.

GRACE

Do what he goddamn says!

JAKE

Go! Go! Go!

114.

JAKE

Oh yeah, baby!

GRACE

Aaahh, crap. Not again.

GRACE

This is gonna ruin my whole day.

JAKE

Hang on, Grace.

CUT TO:

115.

TRUDY

Well, at least they won't be able to

track us up here. Not this deep in the

vortex.

JAKE

It's strongest at the Well of Souls,

right?

TRUDY

Yeah.

JAKE

Good, `cause that's where we're going.

TRUDY

Copy.

JAKE

I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

GRACE

Forget it, it doesn't matter.

JAKE

No!   The People can help you. I know it.

CUT TO:

116.

JAKE (V.O.)

The Well of Souls. The heart of the

forest. I knew the People would go

there.

MO'AT

(SUBTITLED)

Wise ancestors who live within Eywa,

guide us. Give us a sign.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NORM

(LOW)

Tsu'tey is Olo'eyctan now. He's not

going to let you get near that place.

JAKE

I've gotta try, Norm.

117.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face

them again, I was gonna have to change

the rules.

JAKE (V.O.)

Sometimes your whole life boils down to

one insane move.

JAKE

Come on, boy. Time to fly.

JAKE (V.O.)

The way I had it figured, Toruk is the

baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks

him. So why would he ever look up?

118.

JAKE (V.O.)

But that was just a theory.

CUT TO:

NEYTIRI

(breathing the words)

Toruk Macto.

NEYTIRI

(SHOUTING)

Toruk Macto!

CROWD

Toruk Macto... Toruk Macto...

119.

NEYTIRI

I See you.

JAKE

(a hoarse whisper)

I See you.

NEYTIRI

I was afraid Jake -- for my people. I'm

not any more.

JAKE

(SUBTITLED)

Tsu'tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I

stand before you, ready to serve the

People.

(then just for Tsu'tey)

You are Olo'eyctan, and you are the best

warrior. I can't do this without you.

TSU'TEY

I will fly with you.

JAKE

Ireiyo.

JAKE

Grace is dying.     I beg the help of the

Great Mother.

MO'AT

Bring her, Jakesully.

120.

JAKE

Look where we are, Grace.

GRACE

(with a wan smile)

I need to take some samples.

MO'AT

(QUIETLY)

The Great Mother may choose to save all

that she is --

MO'AT

-- in this body.

JAKE

Is that possible?

MO'AT

Possible, yes. She must pass through the

Eye of Eywa -- and return. But Jakesully--

she is very weak.

JAKE

Hang on, they're gonna fix you up.

GRACE

I -- always held back. But you gave them

your heart. I'm proud of you, Jake.

121.

GRACE

Help them.     You do whatever it takes. You

hear me?

JAKE

I will.

GRACE

I'm with her Jake --

(an amazed whisper)

-- she's real --

JAKE

Grace!

122.

MO'AT

Her wounds were too great, there was not

enough time. She is with Eywa now.

JAKE

With your permission, I will Speak now.

You would honor me by translating.

JAKE

The Sky People have sent a message that

they can take whatever they want, and no

one can stop them. But we will send them

a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind

can carry you, tell the other clans to

come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to

them. Fly now with me brothers and

sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky

People that this is our land!

CUT TO:

123.

JAKE (V.O.)

We rode out to the four winds. To the

horse clans of the plain, to the ikran

people of the mountains. When Toruk

Macto called them, they came.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

QUARITCH

People, you are fighting for survival.

There's an aboriginal horde out there

massing for an attack. First slide.

124.

QUARITCH

These orbital images show the hostiles'

numbers have gone from a couple of

hundred to over two thousand in one day,

and more are pouring in. By next week it

could be twenty thousand. Then they'll be

overrunning our perimeter here. We can't

wait. Our only security lies in pre-

emptive attack. We will fight terror

with terror.

QUARITCH

Next slide. This mountain stronghold is

supposedly protected by their deity.

When we destroy it, we will blast a

crater in their racial memory so deep

they won't come within a thousand klicks

of this place.

CUT TO:

SELFRIDGE

This thing is completely out of control!

SELFRIDGE

Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to

turn the mine-workers local into a

freakin' militia!

125.

QUARITCH

I declared threat condition red. That

puts all on-world assets under my

command.

SELFRIDGE

You think you can pull this palace coup

shit on me?! I can have your ass with

one call --

QUARITCH

You're a long way from Earth.

QUARITCH

(to his men)

Get him out of here.

SELFRIDGE

You touch me you're so fired.

CUT TO:

MAX

I don't know how secure this channel is.

JAKE

Talk fast.

MAX

It's crazy here, Jake. It's full

mobilization. They're rigging the

shuttles as bombers. They've made up

these big pallets of mine explosives.

It's for some kind of shock and awe

campaign.

TRUDY

Frickin' daisycutters.

126.

NORM

Holy shit.

JAKE

(to Max)

Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can

cut some kinda deal before this thing

goes all the way.

MAX

No, Quaritch has taken over. He's

rolling and there's no stopping him.

JAKE

When?

MAX

Oh six hundred tomorrow.

JAKE

Thanks.

NORM

We're screwed.

TRUDY

You know he's gonna commit those bombers

straight to the Well of Souls.

JAKE

That's right. Because I gave it to him

on a plate.

TRUDY

We both did.

NORM

If he takes out the Well of Souls -- it's

over. It's their main line to Eywa, to

their ancestors -- it'll destroy them.

JAKE

Then I guess we better stop him.

TRUDY

You need to get some rack.

127.

JAKE

Gonna have to settle for coffee.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

I was a warrior who dreamed he could

bring peace. But there was only one

thing I was ever really good at. Ooh-rah.

JAKE

(Na'vi/subtitled)

Strike here and here.

TRUDY

(LOW)

You know our chances suck.

JAKE

Yeah.

TRUDY

Going up against gunships with bows and

arrows...

JAKE

What's your point?

128.

TRUDY

(NODDING)

Right.

CUT TO:

JAKE

I've never done this in my life.

JAKE

And I'm probably just talking to a tree

right now. But if you're there -- I need

to give you a heads up.

JAKE

If Grace is there with you -- look in her

memories -- she can show you the world we

come from. There's no green there. They

killed their Mother, and they're gonna do

the same thing here.

JAKE

More Sky People are gonna come. They're

gonna come like a rain that never ends --

JAKE

-- until they've covered the world.

Unless we stop them.

(MORE)

129.

JAKE (cont'd)

Look, you chose me for somethin'. And

I'll stand and fight, you know I will.

But I could use a little help here.

NEYTIRI

Our Great Mother does not take sides.

She protects only the balance of life.

JAKE

It was worth a try.

CUT TO:

130.

WAINFLEET

Contact. Two hundred meters.

QUARITCH

Fire for effect.

131.

NORM

Jake!   Jake! We're falling back!

132.

QUARITCH

Blue team, switch forties.   Fire at will.

TROOPERS

Yeah baby!     Get some!

QUARITCH

Blue team, stay with the ground units.

Red team, with me. We're punching for

the main target.

133.

134.

TRUDY

You're not the only ones with guns, you

pricks.

135.

QUARITCH

There it is.

(into his headset)

Valkyrie One, this is Dragon. Target is

in sight.

TROOPER

Target in sight.

JAKE

We have to stop the shuttles, no matter

what it takes.

136.

WAINFLEET

I hear this is worse than death for you,

chief.

TROOPER

Right flank -- something's coming!   It's

all lit up out there.

137.

JAKE

What the hell -- ?

JAKE

WHOO-HOOOO!

138.

WAINFLEET

A and C squads -- rally at my pos.   I

want --

(screaming on the comm)

Who's screaming God damn it?!

TROOPER (ON RADIO)

We gotta get outta here! Whoever's in

charge, call for extraction!

WAINFLEET

Shutup you crybabies!

139.

MAX

Rogue One, Rogue One, this is Max.   Tell

Jake we are in motion.

(to the scientists)

Get in there. Barricade the door!

CUT TO:

140.

PILOT

Mains to a hundred percent!   Get me

airspeed!

PILOT

We're good!

PILOT

Valkyrie Two is breaking off. And if any

of ya'll want to get off this piece of

shit planet, you better cover our ass,

`cause we're the only way back to orbit.

GUNSHIP PILOT

Roger that.

QUARITCH

Get back here you worthless pukes!

141.

PILOT

Are we breaking off?

QUARITCH

What do you think?

SELFRIDGE

(in growing alarm)

What the hell is going on out there?

CUT TO:

PILOT

Sir, all ground units are falling back to

the LZ.

QUARITCH

Stay on target.

QUARITCH

Switch missiles. Arm all pods.

142.

PILOT

Arming.

QUARITCH

Let's see what these blue bastards do

when I bitch-slap their goddess.

QUARITCH

(to the pilot)

Put your mask on.

143.

JAKE

(into his headset)

Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of

Souls! He's got a clear shot. Hit him,

anybody that can! Do it now!

TRUDY

On it.

NORM

No!

TRUDY

(clipped, pilot-like)

Norm, I love you.

144.

TROOPER

Dragon is down. It's off the board.

SELFRIDGE

What do you mean, off the board?!

SELFRIDGE

Oh shit.

CUT TO:

145.

JAKE (O.S.)

It's all over Quaritch --

QUARITCH

Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

JAKE

Kinda hoped you'd say that.

146.

QUARITCH

How does it feel to betray your own race?

147.

148.

CUT TO:

TSU'TEY

(NA'VI)

I See you, Jakesully.

JAKE

I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.

TSU'TEY

Are the people safe?

JAKE

They're safe.

TSU'TEY

I can never ride again, or bond with my

woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa. I can

not lead the People. You will lead them,

Jakesully.

JAKE

No. I'm not officer material.

TSU'TEY

It is decided. Now do the duty of

Olo'eyctan. Set my spirit free.

JAKE

I'm not killing you.

TSU'TEY

I am already dead.

149.

JAKE

No.

TSU'TEY

It is the way. And it is good. I will be

remembered --

TSU'TEY

-- I fought with Toruk Macto, we were

brothers -- and he was my last shadow.

JAKE

(NA'VI)

Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the

Mother Spirit.

DISSOLVE TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen.

CUT TO:

150.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

The forest will heal, and so will the

hearts of the People. New life keeps the

energy flowing, like the breath of the

world.

JAKE (V.O.)

This is my last videolog.

JAKE

The science guys will keep the lights on,

here. But I won't miss this place.

JAKE (V.O.)

I better wrap this up. There's a funeral

tonight, and I don't want to be late. It

was someone very close to me.

151.

CUT TO BLACK
