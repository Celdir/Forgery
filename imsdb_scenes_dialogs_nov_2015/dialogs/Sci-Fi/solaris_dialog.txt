SOLARIS

A MAN'S VOICE

I'm not a poet.  I've never moved

anyone with my words.

(beat)

Maybe that's why they chose me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT

Dr. Kelvin?

CUT TO:

GIBARIAN

We take off into the cosmos, ready

for anything: solitude, hardship,

exhaustion, death.  We're proud of

ourselves, in a way.  But our

enthusiasm is a sham.  We don't

want to conquer the cosmos -- we

want to extend the boundaries of

Earth to the cosmos.  We are only

seeking Man.  We don't want Other

Worlds.  We want mirrors.

(beat)

Maybe we don't need to know what it

is, or why.  Maybe just knowing

that it is should be enough.

DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on

approach, do you read me?

(beat)

Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on

approach, do you read me?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GIBARIAN

Hi, Chris.

(a light smile)

I'm so glad you came.

(beat, the smile fades)

I still have a little time, and I

want to tell you something.  To

warn you.  By now you know about

me, or if you don't, get Snow or

Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't

matter.

(beat)

I didn't lose my mind.  You should

be able to tell from this video.

I'm not mad.

(beat)

If it happens to you, remember that

it isn't madness.

(beat)

You should know, I'm in favor of

destroying Solaris.  I know

that's... illegal.  And unethical.

And irresponsible.  But it's the

only way to make it stop.

GIBARIAN

(addressing whoever made

the noise)

Cut that out.  Do you hear me?

CUT TO:

KELVIN

Snow.  Didn't you hear me radio?

I'm Kelvin.

SNOW

Yes.  We heard.

KELVIN

What's wrong?  What happened to

Gibarian?

SNOW

He's dead.

KELVIN

How?

SNOW

Suicide.

SNOW

You didn't bring any chocolate, did

you?

KELVIN

What?

SNOW

(musing)

I love chocolate.  I realized just

yesterday how much I love it.

(beat, then he recovers)

I thought maybe, if they let you

bring personal effects, you might

have snuck some through, because...

well, I've been thinking about it.

KELVIN

What happened here?

SNOW

I can't talk just now.  I'm too

tired.

KELVIN

Where's Sartorius?

SNOW

In his lab.  He won't let you in.

KELVIN

(leaving)

He'll let me in.

SNOW

Kelvin, if you see anything

unusual...

SNOW

... try to stay calm.

CUT TO:

KELVIN

Let me in.

SARTORIUS

(inside, muffled)

You have to give me your word you

won't come in.  Then I'll come out.

KELVIN

All right.

KELVIN

What happened to Gibarian?

SARTORIUS

Didn't you talk to Snow?

KELVIN

I want to hear your version.

SARTORIUS

(incredulous)

Who, here, could possibly care what

you want?  At best, you're Employee

of the Month for the highest bidder

in the Solaris auction.  They have

no idea what's going on up here.

They've never even been in space.

And I'm supposed to listen to you?

KELVIN

I am here to recover this mission,

report my findings, and make a

recommendation.  Now: What happened

to him?

SARTORIUS

The same thing that could happen to

any of us.

KELVIN

Where's his body?

SARTORIUS

In the lab.  With her, probably.

KELVIN

Her?  Who are you talking about?

SARTORIUS

His last wish was to be buried on

Earth.  In dirt, he said.  "I want

to buried in dirt."  What a clown.

KELVIN

They shouldn't let people like you

into space.

SARTORIUS

Just so you know: I'm not going

back until I understand what it is.

I am going to figure out what it

is, make it stop, and then I will

go home.

KELVIN

Listen --

SARTORIUS

We're done.  Oh, I should tell you,

I don't trust Snow.  There's

something wrong with him.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN

Is there anybody else here?

SNOW

(sits up a little)

Why, who did you see?

KELVIN

Gibarian warned me.  He left me a

message.

SNOW

Who was it?

KELVIN

She was real.  Where did she come

from?

KELVIN

Tell me.  I won't think you're

insane.

SNOW

Oh, that's a relief.

KELVIN

Where did she come from?

SNOW

How much sleep do you need?

KELVIN

How much sleep?

SNOW

How long can you go without sleep?

KELVIN

That depends.

SNOW

Well, when you do go to sleep:

barricade your door.

CUT TO:

KELVIN (V.O.)

The Prometheus, as far as I can

tell, is functionally intact.  Crew

status: One dead, Gibarian.  Cause

of death appears to be suicide.

CUT TO:

KELVIN

Interviews with the surviving

members and a perusal of the

deceased's personal effects

indicate he was suffering from

severe depression with psychotic

features, along with bouts of

hypomania, dementia, delirium, and

primary insomnia.  All of these

symptoms, combined with a profound

sense of isolation, are commonly

found in studies of low stimulation

environments, particularly long

range space travel.  Snow and

Sartorius show indications of

depression, including dysthymic and

bipolar I; a variety of stress

disorders, including acute and

posttraumatic; and suggestions of

agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive

disorder, and hypersomnia.  I

emphasize these are preliminary

opinions on my part.  I will

attempt to convince Snow and

Sartorius to return to Earth, but

as they currently view me as an

intruder of sorts, this may take

some time.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN

Oh, God.  I'm awake.

RHEYA

Yes.

KELVIN

Where did you come from?

KELVIN

How are you here?

RHEYA

How do you mean?

(beat)

Chris, what's wrong?

RHEYA

I love you.

RHEYA

Do you love me?

KELVIN

Yes.

KELVIN

I need to see Snow.

RHEYA

I'll go with you.

KELVIN

(rising)

I'll just be a minute.

RHEYA

Don't.

KELVIN

Why?

RHEYA

I don't know.  I can't be alone.

KELVIN

I'll be right back.

KELVIN

All right.  All right.  Here.

RHEYA

What are they?

KELVIN

To calm your anxiety.

RHEYA

To calm my anxiety.

CUT TO:

RHEYA

We're taking a flight?

KELVIN

Yes.

KELVIN

Go ahead.  I'll close the door

behind me.

CUT TO:

SNOW

Was her breakfast conversation that

bad?

KELVIN

Shut up.

SNOW

I told you, try to stay calm.

You're supposed to be the

psychologist of the bunch.

KELVIN

What was it?

SNOW

Personally, I think it's God.  At

least, it fits my definition.

KELVIN

And professionally?

SNOW

I'm not sure.

(beat)

It started with Gibarian.  He

locked himself in his room and

refused to talk except through a

crack in the door.  He covered the

video lens.  Obviously we thought

he was having a nervous breakdown.

I don't know why he didn't tell us

he had somebody in there.  By this

time, we were getting visitors,

too.  He was desperately trying to

figure it out.  Day and night.

(beat)

Who was she?

KELVIN

My wife.

SNOW

Dead?

SNOW

She has materialized from your

memory of her.  What was her name?

KELVIN

Rheya.

SNOW

It started about three months ago.

Right after the government sold the

expedition.  We were ready to go

home.

KELVIN

Will she come back?

SNOW

Probably.

KELVIN

I wish you'd told me.

SNOW

Told you what?

SNOW

What will you say?

KELVIN

To who?

SNOW

What are you going to report back

to Earth?

KELVIN

I don't know.

SNOW

An enormous amount of money changed

hands to get control of this

project.  We are in little danger

of being left alone for long.

(beat)

You'll need to do something.

Otherwise they'll be sending

someone out to recover you.

KELVIN

Gibarian said he thinks Solaris

should be destroyed.

SNOW

That's ludicrous.  This is contact.

We have found God.  The only issue

is figuring out how to prove this

in a way that will make sense back

on Earth.  So how will we describe

it, if we choose to describe it at

all?

CUT TO:

GIBARIAN

A pre-biological colloidal

envelope, possibly exceeding

terrestrial structures in

complexity; a plasmic mechanism.

Probably without life as we

conceive it, but capable of

performing functional activities on

an astronomic scale.  My view is

that Solaris has reached, in a

single bound, the "homeostatic

ocean" stage without passing

through stages of terrestrial

evolution.  I think it bypassed

cellular development altogether.

It hasn't taken endless eons to

adapt itself to its environment,

but in fact dominated its

environment immediately.  From the

moment it existed, it was the most

superior element in the Universe.

And now it passes the time doing

extravagant theoretical thinking

about the Universe, with us as the

cast.

GIBARIAN

It's engaged in a never-ending

process of transformation; an

ontological autometamorphosis,

begging the question: Can thought

exist separately from

consciousness?

SNOW

It's God.

SARTORIUS

I don't care what it is, we need to

figure out how to make it stop.

GIBARIAN

Nelson, we have the opportunity --

SARTORIUS

What if this thing follows us back

to Earth?  What if what's happening

here started happening on Earth, on

a mass scale?  Don't you see that

as a problem?  I think it's a

serious mistake to assume it's

benign.  For all we know it's

driving us crazy so it can watch us

kill each other.

SNOW

We're not even sure it will let us

leave.

CUT TO:

GIBARIAN

Maybe it's stuck.  Maybe its power

isn't that God-like.  I mean, we

have God-like power relative to an

insect, but that doesn't mean we

can move the Earth around at will.

Maybe it's like a spider web,

waiting for something to show up.

(beat)

We intercepted some brief fragments

of what must be an everlasting

monologue with itself.  Of course

it was beyond our understanding.

(beat)

I've come to hate it here.  There's

only one way out of its reach, for

us.  Humans.

CUT TO:

GIBARIAN

(from a video)

I thought I'd been behaving

normally, rationally.  But a sign

of insanity is the inability to

think about more than one thing.

So if I am consumed by the idea

that I am insane and can't think of

anything else, then I am insane.

(beat, smiles)

You ask questions at the end of

your life, the sort of questions

people who are content don't ask.

(beat)

Maybe life just can't be solved.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN

Rheya...

RHEYA

I want you inside me right now.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN

"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".

RHEYA

Book?

KELVIN

Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of

it when I saw you on the train.

RHEYA

My Thomas is a little rusty.

RHEYA

Not a very happy poem.

KELVIN

You didn't look very happy.

RHEYA

I wasn't.

KELVIN

And tonight?

RHEYA

Better.

KELVIN

That's good to know.

CUT TO:

RHEYA

You want to fuck her?

KELVIN

Stop it.

RHEYA

You behave as though you want to

fuck her.

KELVIN

Rheya.  Not here.

RHEYA

And I just want to know if I'm

crazy or not -- if what I think is

happening is actually happening.

Or am I one of those people, those

women, who are blind to what's

going on?  Who pretend not to see

their husband's attention toward

another woman?

KELVIN

Let's go home.

RHEYA

You go home.

KELVIN

I am.  Please come with me.  I

don't want to do this here.

RHEYA

You talk like an actor.

CUT TO:

RHEYA

I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.

CUT TO:

KELVIN

You're better when you take them.

RHEYA

I know, I know.  But still, somehow

I don't feel better.

KELVIN

All right.  How about I feel better

when you take them?

RHEYA

Right.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN

What do you remember?

RHEYA

What do you mean?

KELVIN

Do you remember Beethoven?  The

Beatles?  Movies, books,

restaurants, friends?

RHEYA

(thinking)

Yes.  But not until you mentioned

them.  As soon as you said those

things, I remembered them.  And

they have associations that make me

think of other things I remember.

It's like filling up.

RHEYA

Is it a planet?

KELVIN

Not exactly.  It exists in a

continuum that wasn't proven until

ten years ago, a higher

mathematical dimension superimposed

on top of the Universe.  An

infinite number of them, in fact.

It was a violation of all of our

various laws regarding the

Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It

was completely counter-intuitive.

We had to unlearn everything.

RHEYA

Is it intelligent?

KELVIN

Intelligent beyond our

comprehension.

RHEYA

Then it's God, right?

KELVIN

It's something.

RHEYA

You still don't believe in God?

KELVIN

The whole idea of God was dreamed

up by a silly animal with a small

brain called Man.  Even the limits

we put on it are human limits.  It

can do this, it can do that!  It

designs, it creates!

RHEYA

Even a God that wasn't active, that

just created something and stood

back and watched?

KELVIN

You're talking about a man in a

white beard again.  You're

ascribing human characteristics to

something that isn't human.  Human

beings look for causes and

patterns.  How could we know what

Solaris is up to, if anything?

RHEYA

But what if Solaris is what there

was before The Big Bang?

KELVIN

As I said, it is beyond our

comprehension.

RHEYA

As I said, then it's God, right?

RHEYA

Why are we talking about this shit

when we could be fucking?

SNOW

Kelvin, you awake?

KELVIN

What is it?

SNOW

Can you meet me and Sartorius on B

deck in an hour?

KELVIN

Why?

SNOW

Just a little strategy session.

But in person this time.

CUT TO:

KELVIN

All right?

KELVIN

Rheya...

RHEYA

What happened?

KELVIN

You were trying to break down the

door.  Do you know why?

RHEYA

When I saw you were gone I got

scared.

RHEYA

Chris, what's wrong with me?

CUT TO:

RHEYA

Am I all right?

KELVIN

Yes.

CUT TO:

SNOW

He won't do it.

SARTORIUS

Why do you say that?

SNOW

He won't.

KELVIN

This is my wife, Rheya.

SARTORIUS

We thought you'd be alone.  We want

to talk about...

SNOW

We want to talk freely.

KELVIN

Go ahead.

SARTORIUS

I suggest we pool our knowledge

regarding the... visitors.  We can

express whatever questions or

conclusions we might have... share

information about our various...

experiments.  Agreed?

SARTORIUS

I would like to start with

motivation.  Why are they here?

SARTORIUS

They are not autonomous individuals

and they're not actual persons.

They are projections materializing

from our minds, based on a given

individual.

SNOW

It's an experiment.

KELVIN

No.  There's no behavior

modification.

SARTORIUS

She reappeared exactly as she had

before?

SNOW

The same vulnerabilities?

SARTORIUS

A recoil, with no compensating

mechanism.

SNOW

And when a given situation no

longer corresponds to the normal

faculties of the... original, the

visitor suffers some sort of

disconnected consciousness.

SARTORIUS

Followed by non-human

manifestations.

SNOW

Are the actions of Solaris

premeditated?

KELVIN

Is it being deliberately cruel, you

mean?  I don't think so.

SNOW

I'm just trying to find an

explanation for the continual

reappearances.

KELVIN

(to Rheya)

When you cut yourself pounding the

door, did it hurt?

RHEYA

Yes.

(looks around)

Of course.

SARTORIUS

If they're not learning anything

and they're not modifying their

behavior, why do they come back?

SNOW

It's like they're plugged into a

game, which goes around and around,

endlessly repeating itself.

CUT TO:

KELVIN

Where've you been?

RHEYA

I been thinking about how much I

hate you.

RHEYA (V.O.)

Yes, I remember that.  I went back

to Lois' house and spent the night.

Those were dark days.

CUT TO:

RHEYA

I would have these -- I don't know

how to describe them -- visions,

when I was younger.  Maybe not

visions, but like these waking

dream states.  Time would just

collapse, I would be inside time.

I would stare at a second hand on a

clock until it stopped.  Freaky

stuff.

KELVIN

How old were you?

RHEYA

Seven, eight.  So one day my mother

catches me sort of staring off into

space, and she asks me what I'm

doing, and I start trying to

explain to her, about this state

that I can put myself in, and this

look comes over her face.

KELVIN

What kind of look?

RHEYA

Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary.

Like I was something to be... her

guard went up.  I was a threat.

Now I know why.  She was afraid

she'd be seen.  That I would see

her for the self-obsessed neurotic

that she was.  I think she thought

she had a few more years of being

on a pedestal.  But that's the

cycle, right?  I knew a little more

than she did, she knew a little

more than her mother, and on and

on.

(beat)

I guess that's part of the reason

why --

KELVIN

I know.  I know.  We don't have to

talk about that.

RHEYA

I remember days of just thinking

about you.

RHEYA

Thinking what you were doing and

saying, just being consumed by

thinking of you.  I loved it so

much, that feeling.

KELVIN

I did too.

KELVIN

I used to watch you undress.

KELVIN

I never tired of watching you

undress.  Every time, it was

exciting.  Right until... to the

end.

RHEYA

What happened to us, exactly?

KELVIN

You don't know?

RHEYA

I remember... something burning.

Coffee burning.

RHEYA

You found me?

KELVIN

I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

RHEYA

Why did you say those things?

KELVIN

I don't know.  I couldn't

understand why you didn't tell me.

KELVIN

When you said you wouldn't make

it... I didn't believe you.  Or I

didn't take you seriously, which is

worse.

KELVIN

I should have believed you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RHEYA

I can't help feeling that I'm

cheating when I take them.

KELVIN

It's genetics.  You know this.  You

know where it comes from.  There is

nothing wrong with uncrossing a few

crossed wires.

CUT TO:

SNOW

You're unnerved because you've

spent your whole life thinking

nobody is looking over you, and

suddenly your subconscious is an

open book.  We are, for the first

time, experiencing changes in

natural reality by a force not our

own.  That proves that --

KELVIN

-- we are not sure of that.  We are

not sure we aren't all

hallucinating.

SNOW

If God is beyond our comprehension,

and she --

(meaning Rheya)

-- is here for reasons that can't

be understood, isn't God here?

KELVIN

Not necessarily.

SNOW

Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable,

how you equivocate!  You, the

atheist, you're more dogmatic than

any holy person I've ever seen!

This is happening, Kevin.  Wake up.

KELVIN

Consciousness is enough, that's all

I've saying.  Consciousness should

be enough for anybody.

SNOW

Who are you trying to convince?

SNOW

It will end badly.  As inevitably

as the rising of a bubble.

SNOW

Let's all meet tomorrow.  Sartorius

has some new ideas, about making it

stop.

CUT TO:

RHEYA

Do you have any idea how much I

like fucking you?

KELVIN

I think so.

RHEYA

Good.  Because I want you to know.

I really like fucking you.

RHEYA

I like that too.

KELVIN (V.O.)

How could she not be real?  I can

smell her, taste her.  She does

exactly what she did... it's not

possible.

RHEYA

(smiles, teasing)

You know, I've decided: I'm just

gonna believe what you believe

about this whole Solaris thing,

it'll make life so much easier; the

little wife agreeing with her big,

strong husband.  You must get such

a headache thinking about those

Great Big Problems all day.

KELVIN (V.O.)

Like I said, it's not possible.

RHEYA

So, Chris, seriously, aren't you

afraid you're going to get fired?

CUT TO:

RHEYA

You sure say "God" a lot when we're

doing it.

KELVIN

I know.  I'm putting that in my

next report.

RHEYA

Right.  The report.  Report and

recommend.

RHEYA

What does Snow think you should do?

KELVIN

Snow thinks we shouldn't leave

until we figure out a way to

document it, to prove its existence

to the planet Earth.  This is

hilarious: He thinks it's God, but

he wants it to sit still for a

photograph so he can show the folks

back home.

RHEYA

Sartorius wants to destroy it.

KELVIN

Well.  He doesn't think it's God,

but for different reasons than me.

He's thinking: If I can figure out

how to make it stop, than I am

smarter than it is, and therefore

it cannot be God.

RHEYA

He has a point.

KELVIN

He does have a point.  That's just

not the way I'd like to see it

proven.

RHEYA

You feel sorry for Solaris, or for

me?

KELVIN

It's a violent response to

something we haven't figured out.

Don't let the cowardly demeanor

fool you: He is ruthless.

Unblinking in his prejudice.

RHEYA

It was obvious from the way he

first looked at me.

RHEYA

Do I really feel like... I am...?

KELVIN

Yes.  Yes.

RHEYA

I'm glad.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN

Everything you pursue, you end up

becoming disinterested in.  The

fact that you're good at everything

you try makes it worse.  You have a

degree in animal science, you could

be a terrific vet.

You drifted into writing and turned

out to be a perceptive journalist.

Then it was politics, which seemed

best of all, you had an actual gift

for understanding the best pattern

for a group of people to be

arranged for you to achieve your

goal.  And they didn't even know

they were being arranged.  But you

got bored with it, like you do with

everything.

KELVIN

I don't know what it's really like,

to not know what you want to do.

To not have anything that you love

to do more than anything else.

RHEYA

(sarcastic)

Imagine my frustration.

CUT TO:

KELVIN

What's wrong.

RHEYA

You don't love me.

KELVIN

Stop.

RHEYA

I have to talk to you... I... I

don't know where I came from.

(up at him)

Do you know?

RHEYA

If you know but can't tell me

now... will you ever be able to?

KELVIN

What are you talking about?

RHEYA

That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya

died.  Killed herself.  I'm

different.

KELVIN

Who have you been talking to?

RHEYA

(no reason to lie)

Sartorius.

KELVIN

When?  When I'm asleep?

KELVIN

I'm sure there are worse people to

talk to, but I don't know who they

are.

RHEYA

I'm just trying to understand

what's going on.

RHEYA

How have you lived the last ten

years?  Did you love anyone?

RHEYA

Did you think about me?

RHEYA

But we fought.

KELVIN

Yes.  Especially toward the end.

RHEYA

Why did she do it?

KELVIN

You... she said I didn't love her.

RHEYA

Was she right?

KELVIN

No.  I love you.

RHEYA

(reflexive, but genuine)

I love you, too.

KELVIN

Can you sleep?

RHEYA

I don't think do.  It's not sleep;

it's something else.  It's all

around me.

KELVIN

Those are dreams.

FADE OUT.

SNOW

Gibarian was under enormous --

SARTORIUS

Gibarian was helpless.  It's very

simple: Man created the science

that resulted in the discovery of

Solaris, and the ship that brought

us here.

KELVIN

Meaning Man can do whatever the

fuck it wants?

SARTORIUS

Yes.

KELVIN

That's fantastic.

SARTORIUS

Why did you agree to come here?

SARTORIUS

Too tired to answer?

SARTORIUS

I'll bet.  Is this what they sent

you here to do?  You've lost it,

you've gone native.

RHEYA

(to Sartorius)

You're the coward.

KELVIN

Don't debate him; he'll say

anything.

RHEYA

(still, to Sartorius)

I'm just as human as you.  I see, I

hear, I touch, and I feel just like

you do.

SARTORIUS

Prove it.

RHEYA

These "guests" are a part of you,

of your subconscious.  Chris loves

me.

SARTORIUS

YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!  Try to

understand that if you can

understand anything!

KELVIN

Get out of here.

SARTORIUS

Rheya is dead.  She's a copy.  A

facsimile.  And she's seducing you

all over again.  You're sick.  You

think of fucking her as research

for humanity.  It's just fucking.

SARTORIUS

There's nothing grandiose about it.

You've jumped out of a plane and

you're trying to sew a parachute

together while you fall.

SARTORIUS

It'd be hilarious if it weren't so

damn sad.

SNOW

We didn't even get to hear his new

ideas.

SNOW

I'm not feeling well.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SNOW

We can liquidate the station.  Take

the Athena back.

KELVIN

No.

SNOW

Of course, when we return, we'll be

regarded as lunatics if we tell the

truth.

(shrugs)

We'll chalk it up to isolation,

collective derangement.

KELVIN

I've never heard you express any

desire to leave before now.  Why

now?

SNOW

Well, I think we're reaching the

point of diminishing returns here,

right?  Certainly it's learning

more about us than we'll ever learn

about it.

KELVIN

But why is it doing what it's

doing?  Given it's resources, it

could have done anything.

Presented me with your double, and

you with mine.

SNOW

Perhaps it did.

KELVIN

Human beings can die.

SNOW

But they are human.  They certainly

become human with incredible speed.

First they're like they were in our

memory, but then they fill in on

their own.  DNA doesn't determine

the hundreds of trillions of

connections that occur in the

brain, it's not dense enough.  They

build up with experience.

KELVIN

They come when you sleep.

SNOW

That's right.  And we all have to

sleep, eventually.

CUT TO:

RHEYA

You don't want me.

KELVIN

Rheya.

RHEYA

That's what you were saying.  I

heard what you were saying.

KELVIN

For a reason that neither of us

understand, you are forced to stay

near me.  That's all I know right

now.

RHEYA

I have these strange thoughts, I

don't know where they come from.

(beat)

I can't explain it.

KELVIN

Neither can I.  Not any of it.

There's no reference point for

what's going on; it's never

happened before.  It's a clean

break in the fabric of the

Universe; a gap.  There is nothing

to do but experience it, moment-to-

moment, and not let it destroy us.

RHEYA

But that's what happened before.

KELVIN

Not this time.

RHEYA

Do you want to stay here?

KELVIN

Do you?

RHEYA

If you're here.

DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

Gibarian.

GIBARIAN

Leave the light off.

GIBARIAN

I wish you'd come a little sooner.

I might not have had to kill

myself.

GIBARIAN

You think you're dreaming me, like

you dream her.  Understand

something: I am the real Gibarian.

Just a new incarnation.

KELVIN

What do you want?

GIBARIAN

You're being tricked.  Sartorius

picked a fight with you to avoid

telling you about his idea for

getting rid of the visitors.  He's

figured out they're made of

subatomic particles called

neutrinos, and he's going to create

a negative neutrino field.  Twenty

four hours a day, until they're

back on Earth.

KELVIN

Can it work?

GIBARIAN

It can.  Ordinary matter, like

ours?  Not affected.  Everything

else, disintegrates.

GIBARIAN

What I'm saying is: Don't trust

anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of

some sort.

KELVIN

I can trust Rheya.

GIBARIAN

You'll end up like me.

KELVIN

You're not Gibarian...

GIBARIAN

No?  Who am I, then?

KELVIN

A puppet.

GIBARIAN

And you're not?  Maybe you're my

puppet.  But like all puppets, you

think you're actually human.  It's

The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if

they're human!

RHEYA

What's wrong?

KELVIN

Gibarian.  He was here.

RHEYA

You said he was dead.

KELVIN

He is.  But he was here...

KELVIN

He spoke to me.

CUT TO:

KELVIN

Are you going to take them?

RHEYA

What's happening to us?

KELVIN

It's all right.

RHEYA

Please don't lie.  I told you

before, I don't know how I came to

be here.  Whatever you think you

can't say to me, I need to hear you

say it.

KELVIN

I love you.

RHEYA

Don't.  I'm the one at risk here.

If we're playing out what happened

before, I won't survive.

KELVIN

That won't happen again.  We're

different.

RHEYA

How can I tell?  You've seen both

of me.  I only know what you're

like here.  You're all I know.

There is no "You" from before.

RHEYA

How could it be so cruel?  How

could it torture us like this?

KELVIN

I don't think it knows it's

torturing us.  It's just watching.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SNOW

What happened?

KELVIN

She drank liquid oxygen.

KELVIN

She's dead.

SNOW

She'll come back, don't worry.  But

then what?  My theory is she can

only live here, that she will die

if she leaves this ship.

SNOW

Why do you think she hasn't

suggested that?  It's the most

obvious solution: Escape.  She

knows she can't leave here --

KELVIN

Get out --

SNOW

Oh, this one you love?  What about

the first one, the one you fucked

and then put into a rocket and

blasted into space?  You didn't

love her?

SNOW

What happens if she comes back?  Is

that polygamy?  And even if you

could take her home, how would you

get her through?  You think they're

not going to notice her?

SNOW

I never get used to them, these...

"Resurrections".

RHEYA

What am I?  Why can't I die?

RHEYA

I'm not Rheya.  You're always known

that.

KELVIN

Rheya --

RHEYA

Don't call me that.

KELVIN

Listen: I don't care about anything

but the fact that you are here.

You are her, you are Rheya.

RHEYA

I'm disgusting.

KELVIN

No.

RHEYA

You're lying.  I'm not human.

KELVIN

Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm

staying here with you.

RHEYA

Then you'll die.

KELVIN

I want every second I can get with

you.

RHEYA

What will I do, if you die?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RHEYA

Do you think I can get pregnant

here?

KELVIN

We'll know soon enough.

RHEYA

I can't be a mother.

KELVIN

That's good to know.

CUT TO:

RHEYA

Don't do this.  I am literally

begging you not to do this.  Chris.

KELVIN

You should have told me.

RHEYA

It wouldn't have made any

difference.

KELVIN

Thank you.

RHEYA

Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I

didn't think you'd react like this.

KELVIN

Neither did I.

RHEYA

You never said you wanted one.

KELVIN

I never said I didn't.

RHEYA

Chris --

KELVIN

I can't stay here.

RHEYA

Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious.

I won't make it.

KELVIN

Then you won't make it.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN

I came back.  You have to know

that.  I came back that night.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN

I couldn't make it, either.

(beat)

I'm so sorry.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GIBARIAN

If they succeed, you'll never see

her again.

CUT TO:

RHEYA

You're afraid of me.  I can't do

this anymore.  I still don't

understand.  It's not possible.

RHEYA

Don't --

RHEYA

What do I have to do to stop it?

KELVIN

I want you here.

RHEYA

You're lying.

KELVIN

You exist here.  I keep telling

you.

RHEYA

That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.

KELVIN

Who are you, then?

RHEYA

I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the

woman you loved ten years ago.

KELVIN

Yes, you are --

RHEYA

Did you hear what Gibarian said?

I'm not a human being.  I'm an

instrument.  I came from your

memory and your imagination and I

will torture you no matter what.

Even if I remain passive.  That's

when I drank the...

(beat)

I was going mad.  It felt like

there was no body underneath my

skin.  There was something else.

An illusion.  But I could feel my

heart beating, and I remembered you

tested my blood.  Is it like yours?

KELVIN

Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly

like mine.

RHEYA

But then I would be dead now.

KELVIN

Is that really what you want?

RHEYA

I want to stop taking those pills.

KELVIN

I wish you wouldn't.

RHEYA

They do something to me.  It's hard

to think straight.

KELVIN

I think they help.

RHEYA

I have consciousness, but I am not

mortal.  Don't you see why I'm

going crazy?

KELVIN

You have to remember that I love

you, that's all that matters --

RHEYA

I can't --

KELVIN

It put you here.  I'll admit it, it

acted like a God and put you here,

put you into my consciousness.

I was asleep, and it put you into

my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And

there you were.

(beat)

Whether you've been sent here to

make me happy or punish me, it

doesn't matter.  The decision we

make now is all that matters.  Stay

with me.

RHEYA

Am I really her?

KELVIN

I don't know anymore.  All I see is

you.

KELVIN

Stay with me.

(beat)

Stay with me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN

She knows everything.  She knows

who she is.

SNOW

She knows everything?  Does she

know she came once before and you

put her in --

KELVIN

No.

SNOW

What do you want?

KELVIN

I want you to get Sartorius to

abandon his plan.

SNOW

(feigning innocence)

What plan?

KELVIN

Just get him to stop.

SNOW

What do you want to do, leave the

station with her?

KELVIN

Yes.

SNOW

Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You

don't believe me?  Let's radio that

shuttle pod you launched -- better

yet, let's go get it.  I've charted

it's trajectory, only take a few

hours...

KELVIN

Her oxygen would have run out.

SNOW

Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should

we check?

SNOW

Who are you trying to please?

Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this

one or that one.  Can you face

both?  We are in a situation that

is beyond morality.  So: Leave with

her.  You'll see the

transformation.

KELVIN

Into what?

SNOW

You'll see her die, that's all.

They're mortal, despite what she

told you.  She will die.  Then what

will you do?

KELVIN

I love her.

SNOW

You do, you don't.  She's willing

to give her life, you're willing to

give yours, it's touching and

magnificent, anything you want but

-- this isn't the place for it.

Don't you see?  No, you don't.

CUT TO:

SARTORIUS

I'm sending you a message because I

feel sorry for you.  I really do,

Kelvin.

(beat)

It is a mistake to become

emotionally engaged with one of

them.  You are being manipulated.

You are going around in circles to

satisfy the curiosity of a power we

don't understand and can't control,

and she is the living proof that

power exists.  If she were ugly,

you wouldn't want her around;

that's why she's not ugly.  She is

a mirror that reflects part of your

mind.  You provide the formula.

You can only finish where you

started, remember that.

(beat)

They sold us out to the highest

bidder.  They had no right to do

that.  We should have been

consulted.  We're not fucking

hardware.

CUT TO:

RHEYA

What are you taking?

KELVIN

A sleeping pill.  Do you want

yours?

KELVIN

What does it want?

RHEYA

I don't know.  Something.

Anything.

RHEYA

It created me and yet I can't

communicate with it.  It must hear

me, though.  It must know what's

happening to me.  Don't you think?

CUT TO:

SNOW

I don't think it dislikes us.  I

think it just noticed us.  It

lives, thinks, and acts.  We are

dealing with a living creature

here, no question.  And it's done

something we've never been able to

do: create a perfect human body.

Perfect except for the subatomic

alterations, but...

CUT TO:

GIBARIAN

If Solaris is inside our brain, and

it knows everything, and we're only

consciously aware of what 2% of our

brain is up to at any given moment,

it knows us better than we know

ourselves.  It's not even close.

CUT TO:

RHEYA

I've decided that if it is God,

it's a sick God.  Its ambitions

exceed its powers, but it doesn't

realize it.

(beat)

It's created a situation without a

goal, and I hate that.  A God whose

passion is not a redemption, who

saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.

(beat)

And us?  We would have to have "an

arrangement".  An unspoken

understanding that I am not human.

How can I not hate something that

does that?

KELVIN

Please.  Don't.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN (V.O.)

I though I was home.

CUT TO:

KELVIN (V.O.)

I thought it was over.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN

Where did you go before?

RHEYA

When?

KELVIN

Last night.  You were talking to

someone in the corridor.

RHEYA

You must have been dreaming.

KELVIN

What's the matter?

KELVIN

Rheya?

KELVIN (V.O.)

I'm losing my mind.

(beat)

I'm breaking apart.

KELVIN (V.O.)

Is this what it means to die?

(beat)

Am I in the moment of my own death?

(beat)

Is this the last thought I will

ever have?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN (V.O.)

I am home now.

(beat)

I try to find the rhythm of the

world where I used to live... but I

feel completely and continually out

of-sync.  I am separate.  Why did I

return to Earth and lie about what

happened?  Lie about having contact

with something like Solaris?  I

knew something else was out there,

and didn't tell a soul.  I left

them in the dark.  We all did.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN (V.O.)

So why come back at all?  To see if

she comes here?

KELVIN (V.O.)

I don't believe it will happen.

KELVIN (V.O.)

But I will wait, anyway.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN (V.O.)

I thought it was over.

RHEYA

Don't blame them.  I begged them to

do it.  It's better this way.

(beat)

I'm sorry.

(beat)

I'm sorry I tried to make you think

I was human.

(beat)

I read my own suicide note.  I

found it in your things.  I

realized I was not her.

RHEYA

I know that you loved me, Chris.  I

know that.

(beat)

I love you.

CUT TO:

KELVIN

"Though they go mad they shall be

sane.  Though they sink through the

sea they shall rise again."

RHEYA (V.O.)

"Though lovers be lost love shall

not.  And death shall have no

dominion."

KELVIN (V.O.)

You killed her!

SARTORIUS (V.O.)

Not her.  It.

CUT TO:

KELVIN

You murdered her!

SARTORIUS

Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a

short-range version of the

destabilizer prototype, a miniature

with a range of a few meters.  She

walked into it and disappeared.

She was gone.

KELVIN

She'll come back.

SARTORIUS

No, she won't.

KELVIN

Why would you let her to do that?

SARTORIUS

It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever

it is, it's not human, and I am

threatened by that.  Evolution-of-

the-species-at-stake threatened.

And I want to win.  I want humans

to win.  So I am killing it before

it kills me.

KELVIN

You fucking bastard...

SARTORIUS

Whose side are you on?

CUT TO:

SARTORIUS

(yelling as he runs)

It's changing characteristics.

It's solidifying taking on weight.

KELVIN

How quickly?

SARTORIUS

If it continues, it will implode

from its own weight and turn into a

black hole in about four hours and

pulls us in with it.

KELVIN

Where's Snow?  Did you call him?

SARTORIUS

Yes.

KELVIN

(via intercom)

Snow!  We need you up here.

KELVIN

Snow!

KELVIN

What's wrong with you?  We need

your help.

SNOW

I won't be making the trip.

SARTORIUS

Snow, get up here, now.

SNOW

I'm not Snow.

SNOW

I got rid of him.  I wanted to see

if... I wanted to be the only one.

I wanted to be Snow.

SARTORIUS

Fuck me.  I knew it.

KELVIN

When did this happen?

SNOW

Oh, right away.  That's why you

never saw me with anyone.  You

should've noticed that.  I miss

him, though.  I think I made a

mistake.

KELVIN

Jesus...

SNOW

But I can't leave with you.  I

won't make it.

KELVIN

Maybe you can.

SARTORIUS

You want it coming back with us?

SNOW

You go ahead.  Of what I remember

about Earth... it's all one thing

now.  Everything's a blur.  I like

distinctions.

SARTORIUS

We do not have time to deal with

this.  Get the diode sail into

position and let me know when the

bias drive and the induction ring

are at zero point.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KELVIN (V.O.)

Earth.

(beat)

What did that word mean to me?

(beat)

I have returned.  Finally.

KELVIN (V.O.)

I work in the city now.  After work

I wander and lose myself.  I am

silent and attentive.  I follow the

current.  I make a conscious effort

to smile, nod, stand, and perform

the millions of gestures that

constitute life on Earth.

KELVIN (V.O.)

I will study these gestures until

they become reflexes again.  I will

find new interests and occupations,

but --

KELVIN (V.O.)

I will not... give myself.  I will

not give myself to anything or

anyone, because I am haunted by the

idea that I remembered her wrong.

That I shaded my memory of her to

suit myself.  That I was unfair to

her and caused her destruction.

What if I was wrong about

everything?

(beat)

I've come to believe that memory is

a curse.

KELVIN

How can you be here...

RHEYA

(whispering)

Shhhh.  Just stay with me.

(beat)

Stay with me.  Everything is

forgiven.  Everything.

KELVIN

I love you.

FADE OUT.
