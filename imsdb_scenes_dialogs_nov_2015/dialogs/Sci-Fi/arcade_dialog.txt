DISSOLVE TO:

ALEX (V.O.)

Time.  That's all I ever think about

anymore.  It's like there's never enough of

it, you know?

CUT TO:

ALEX (V.O.)

It's strange.  When the future's in front

of you, it seems to go on forever.  I mean,

you never really get there.  It's always

one step ahead of you.  It's like there's

no present. There's no "now".  As soon as

you think, "I'm here", the moment's already

gone.  Either everything's in the future,

or it's in the past.

(beat)

There's no "now".

MAN (V.O.)

So where are you then?

ALEX (V.O.)

I'm in the past.

CUT TO:

MR. WEAVER

We don't have to stop now...

ALEX

(cutting him off)

That's okay.  I've got a test coming up

anyway.  Gotta study.

MR. WEAVER

(sighs)

I have to tell you, I'm a little concerned

about you, Alex.  It's been three months

now since your mother, uh...

ALEX

(offering, fixing him with

a stare)

Killed herself?

MR. WEAVER

(reluctant)

Yes.  Now your father...

ALEX

He's a basket case.  You've talked to him.

You know that.  He might as well be dead

too.

ALEX

(continuing)

Look Mr. Weaver, I don't even know why I

came here.  I fine.  Really.

(looking up)

It's like I said.  It's just part of the

past now.  It doesn't matter anymore.

CUT TO:

NICK

(to Benz)

You're an idiot, you know that? What're you

going to do when you get out of here?

BENZ

I was thinking about writing for one of

those Filipino mail order brides...

STILTS

I think I saw that on the Home Shopping

Network.  The Girlfriend Hour, right after

Auto Accessories.

BENZ

(giggling)

Exactly.

LAURIE

You guys are sick.

GREG

So how'd it go?

ALEX

He thinks I'm "sublimating".

STILTS

What the hell does that mean?

LAURIE

It means she's screwed up.

STILTS

Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.

BENZ

You are fucked up.

STILTS

Yeah, but only because I want to be.

GREG

Would you guys knock it off?

GREG

(continuing)

Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's

don't know anything.  They're full of shit.

If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect

kid, they freak.

ALEX

(nodding)

I know.

GREG

So tell me you're okay, then.

ALEX

I'm okay.

GREG

(smiles)

Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.

GREG

(to Alex)

Hey...watch this...

NICK

(engrossed in his game

again)

You making another one, Greg?

GREG

Sure.  Practice.

BENZ

Lemme see...

STILTS

Cool.

GREG

(still working)

See, when the emulsion's still warm you can

move it around...

(stops)

There.

GREG

Safe keeping.

NICK

Shit.  I'm out.

BENZ

You guys going to Dante's after school?

GREG

I don't know.

BENZ

Check it out...

NICK

(excited)

That's the new Slip-Stream game. Those guys

are good.  It's supposed to be interactive.

Graphics are unbelievable.

BENZ

Yeah?  They were handing these out at

Dante's.  Test marketing it or something.

Gonna have a demonstration today.

STILTS

Cool.

LAURIE

Can you say anything but "cool"?

STILTS

Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of

things...

GREG

(annoyed)

Guys...

BENZ

So how 'bout it?

NICK

I'm game...

(to Greg)

Greg?

GREG

Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school,

try the game out, maybe get some dinner.

ALEX

And then keep on driving?

GREG

Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.

LAURIE

(nodding)

I could go for that.

CUT TO:

BENZ

Check it out...

STILTS

Definitely cool.

NICK

Super computers, micro-processors... That's

the future we're looking at.

DELOACH

(looking around)

So how come they're previewing it in this

shit-hole?

STILTS

If you weren't such a dick, you'd know what

a cool place this was.

DELOACH

Gimme a break, they got fucking Space

Invaders here.  That's shit's for retards.

STILTS

So...are you trying to say I'm retarded?

Is that what you're implying?

DELOACH

No, but since I'm standing here, I'm

noticing that you're an ugly little fuck

and you're making me sick...

FINSTER

(shaking them)

Cut it out!!!

ALEX

It's okay, Mr. Finster...

FINSTER

No it's not.

(to the boys)

You guys are shits and I'm throwing you out.

DELOACH

(acting tough)

Your place sucks.  Who gives a shit about

"ARCADE" anyway?

VOICE (O.S.)

(booming, metallic)

WHAT DID YOU SAY?

LAURIE

(a whisper)

Jesus...

ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)

Not bad, huh?

DIFFORD

Hi, kids.

(nods)

Mr. Finster...

DIFFORD

(smooth as silk)

We're glad you people could make it, and

we're anxious to have you try out our new

product.  We think it's going to be a big

seller.  But you're the people that make it

happen.  You're the market share everyone's

tearing each other apart to get at.  It's

your opinion that's going to make or break

us.

NICK

So what's so different about Arcade? You

guys've been talking about it for months.

DIFFORD

A man after my own heart.  Straight to the

point.

(to everyone)

What's different about ARCADE is the way it

reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It

learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it

changes its strategy.

NICK

That's impossible.

DIFFORD

(taking the bait)

Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?

GREG

Go for it, Nick.

DIFFORD

(indicating equipment)

The CyberGloves are keyed into the game's

response mechanism.  You'll be able to pick

things up inside the world...tools, weapons

... it'll feel like they're really in your

hands...

DIFFORD

(continuing)

The goggles heighten the experience. When

we said "Reality will never be the same",

we weren't kidding.

NICK

(skeptical)

"Escape"?

DIFFORD

In case things get too intense.  It

automatically freezes the game, gives you a

breather.  Things can get pretty wild...

BENZ

(scoffing)

Nick won't need it.

DIFFORD

You're good, eh?

NICK

(grins)

The best.

NICK

(to Difford)

So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a

princess?  Fighting Zombies?

DIFFORD

It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each

one is a different layer of the ARCADE

universe.  The concept is, you're entering

the video game itself, making your way

across the circuit board to the logic core

... ARCADE's brain.

NICK

So how do I start?

DIFFORD

The game will guide you.

ARCADE

I AM ARCADE.

(breathing)

YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES?  YOU PICKED THE

WRONG MACHINE.

ARCADE

WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

NICK

Nick.

ARCADE

(almost contemptuous)

NICK.  KISS REALITY GOODBYE.

LAURIE

(concerned)

What's it doing?!

DIFFORD

Memorizing Nick's features.  Watch.

ARCADE

ONE WORD OF ADVICE, NICK.  YOU SPEND TOO

MUCH TIME IN ONE PLACE, AND I SEND OUT THE

SCREAMER.  YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND WHEN

THAT HAPPENS.

(laughs)

SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.

BENZ

Check it out!

GREG

Come on, Nick...

GREG

Nick...you okay?

NICK

You gotta try this thing.

ALEX

Go for it.

GREG

Hold my keys, then.

GREG

(to Difford)

So how do I get back in?

DIFFORD

Just hit "ESCAPE" again.

CUT TO:

DIFFORD

Here's what we're going to do.  What I'm

holding are the home versions of ARCADE,

the prototypes...

DIFFORD

(continuing)

In a month or so we're planning on releasing

ARCADE in both versions, but we're still

fine tuning, and that's where you guys luck

out.  So what we'll do is have you register

with us, and then we're going to loan these

out to you for a week or so.  The only thing

you have to do in return is answer some

marketing questions. Sound fair?

DIFFORD

So what do you think?

NICK

Sign me up.

ALEX

Where's Greg?

LAURIE

He's still working on the game.

ARCADE

TIME'S UP, FRIEND.

ALEX

Where's Greg?

KID

Don't know.  I think I saw him walk out,

but I'm not sure...

ALEX

Has anyone seen Greg?

STILTS

He's probably outside.  You know how he is.

Gets bored...

NICK

Yeah, outside.

CUT TO:

ALEX

So where is he?

NICK

Guess he took off...  You have his keys,

right?

NICK

Hmmm.  He said you were going to have

dinner?

ALEX

Yeah...

NICK

So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's

up to something...

ALEX

(cutting him off)

But he was playing the game.  I mean, you

saw him...

NICK

It's nothing, okay?  Just take his car home.

He'll show up.

NICK

Don't worry about it.

ALEX

Fuck-you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ALEX

Dad...Dad...

JIM

Yeah?

ALEX

Did Greg call, Dad?

ALEX

You should go to bed, Dad.

JIM

...am in bed...

ALEX

(standing back up)

Yeah.

CUT TO:

ARCADE

(malevolent)

HELLO, ALEX.

ALEX

How ...

ARCADE

KISS REALITY GOODBYE.

ALEX

(both frightened and

fascinated)

Where's Greg?

ARCADE

IN HERE, OF COURSE.

"LEVEL ONE"  flash across the screen and we...

CUT TO:

ALEX

(to herself, remembering)

Screamer.

CUT TO:

ALEX

(dry-mouthed)

Hello?

NICK (O.S.)

(filtered)

Hey, kid.

ALEX

Nick...

NICK  (O.S.)

(filtered)

Have you played the game yet?  It's

incredible!  I was just...

ALEX

(cutting him off)

Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think

the game has something to do with it.

NICK (O.S.)

(filtered)

What the hell are you talking about?

NICK (O.S.)

(filtered)

You there?  Hello?

ALEX

I have to talk to you.

NICK (O.S.)

(filtered)

We are talking...

ALEX

No, in person.  Now.

NICK (O.S.)

(filtered)

It's twelve-thirty!

ALEX

I'm coming over.

ALEX

Shit...

ARCADE

ALEX...

ALEX

(to herself)

Okay...don't think about it...

(deep breath)

Okay.

GREG

(on screen, strange)

Alex...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NICK

Alex, you don't know how long I've waited

for this.

ALEX

Funny.

ALEX

What's that?

NICK

Isn't it amazing?  It's a sort of rest

position in the game, when you're between

levels.

NICK

(continuing)

They're fractals.  Visual representations

of mathematic equations.  The game is

totally brilliant.  I mean, look at it,

it's like a DNA molecule or something...

ALEX

Something weird's happening.

NICK

What do you mean by "weird"?

ALEX

Greg never came home.  A few hours is one

thing, Nick, but this is different.

Something's happened to him.

ALEX

Can you turn off the game?

NICK

I'm in the middle of it...

ALEX

(upset)

Turn if off!

NICK

Happy?

ALEX

No.

(frustrated)

Look, I know you're not going to believe me,

but listen anyway...

(carefully)

I think the game's alive somehow.

ALEX

(continuing)

No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up

earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As

soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my

name.  How could it know?  And then, I

asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In

here".

NICK

Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's

gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's

in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's

doing it...

ALEX

(insistent)

It is.

NICK

How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's

don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a

good program, a brilliant program, it was

designed so it would act as if it were

alive, but it's not alive.

ALEX

So how did it know my name, then?

NICK

(shrugs)

You imagined it.

ALEX

See, men always do this.  "Quiet down,

honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not

a fucking idiot, Nick!

(screaming)

I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!

NICK

(a strained whisper)

Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.

ALEX

There!

ALEX

It turned itself back on, Nick.

NICK

No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or

something.  It happens.

ALEX

It's alive, Nick.  It's listening to us ...

NICK

Just shut up!  Enough already, okay?

NICK

Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.

ALEX

Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...

NICK

I'll try Stilts.  He's got insomnia.

NICK

Okay...Laurie, then.

NICK

Benz...

ALEX

(fatalistic)

Something's happened to them.

NICK

It's the middle of the night.  They're

asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.

ALEX

All of them?

NICK

Look, why are you fucking with me like this?

ALEX

Because I didn't know where else to go.

NICK

(glances at a clock)

It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home.

Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in

the morning.

NICK

(continuing)

It's not this weird.  It'll make sense.

Everything gets weird this late anyway,

right?

ALEX

(half-hearted)

Sure.

ALEX

If I were you, I'd think twice about playing

that game again.

CUT TO:

ALEX

Well?  Where are the others?

STILTS

Sick?

ALEX

Everybody's sick, huh?

(glances at watch)

It's fifteen after.  We always meet here,

you know that.

STILTS

(to Nick)

What's her problem?

ALEX

Did you play ARCADE last night?

STILTS

Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick,

here, that my t.v.'s busted...

ALEX

You want to hear something else, Nick? I

tried to call them this morning...Greg,

Benz, Laurie...  Their phones are out of

order.

ALEX

(continuing)

And then I started thinking...about everyone

else that was at Dante's yesterday.  I drew

up this list. DeLoach, those other jerks ...

their phones are out of order too.

NICK

(annoyed)

So what do you want me to do?

ALEX

We have to find out what's happened to them.

I think they're gone...

NICK

No way.

ALEX

If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.

(pleading)

Come on, Nick.

NICK

Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things

are cool, I don't want to hear anything more

about this.  Life's too short, know what I

mean?

STILTS

So you guys are cutting school?  Lemme go

with you.

NICK

Just stay here, Stilts.

ALEX

(dead serious)

And don't watch any television.

STILTS

Oh, okay.  Forget Twilight Zone, now we're

talking Outer Limits here.  We control your

horizontal, your vertical...

NICK

Just do what she says, Stilts.  And if we're

not back...

STILTS

I'll call the National Guard.  I got it

under control.

(giggles)

Oh, just one more thing.  Is it a

supernatural thing you guys are going off

to fight, or is it aliens, like Pod People

and stuff like that?  Cause there's a

difference, you know.  One you need garlic

and silver bullets for, the other...

NICK

(irritated)

Look at me, Stilts.  Am I laughing?

NICK

Just do what she said.  Don't watch

television.

CUT TO:

NICK

Well?

ALEX

She thought Benz was at school.

NICK

Where to now?

ALEX

Laurie's.

CUT TO:

ALEX

Come on.

ALEX

(to herself)

Laurie...answer...come on...

ALEX

Shit.

ALEX

This is like a movie or something.  I mean,

am I paranoid or what?

NICK

It doesn't necessarily mean she's...

ALEX

(cutting him off)

Let's go around back.

ALEX

(visibly relieved)

She's here!

ALEX

It is the game.

ALEX

Laurie!

ALEX

(louder)

LAURIE!

ALEX

Nick, what do we do?!

NICK

(realizing)

No, Alex!  Alex, wait a minute...

NICK

(freaked)

What is it?

ALEX

(shaking Laurie)

Laurie...wake up...

LAURIE

(voice distant)

I am awake.

(grins wider)

Don't you see them?

NICK

See what?

LAURIE

Angels.  There are angels inside.

ALEX

We have to turn it off, Laurie.  I'm turning

it off...

GREG

(static-laced)

Alex.  Don't leave me here.

NICK

Jesus Christ!

ARCADE

(mocking Greg, electronic)

"DON'T LEAVE ME HERE".

ARCADE

(seductive)

HI, NICK.  READY TO KISS REALITY GOODBYE?

ALEX

Change the channel!

NICK

What?!

NICK

(angry, scared)

Who are you?!

ARCADE

GOD.

ARCADE

COME INSIDE.  I ONLY WANT TO PLAY.

ALEX

Oh God...  He's in the cable system! He's

out of the game!

ARCADE

SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.

ALEX

Laurie...

NICK

Is she breathing?

NICK

Then leave her.

ALEX

We can't...

NICK

We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke

in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to

believe what happened here!

NICK

(continuing)

I believe you now.  I don't know what the

fuck just happened, but it did. Now let's

get the hell out of here.

ALEX

Where do we go?

NICK

My house.  I want to try something.

CUT TO:

NICK

Around back.

NICK

I'm not taking any chances.

NICK

Okay.  I'm going inside.  If I'm not back

out in, say, two minutes, you get the hell

out of here.

ALEX

Meet you by the car.

CUT TO:

NICK

We need to find a pay-phone.

CUT TO:

NICK

That's what I thought.

ALEX

What?

NICK

It's not just the cable system.  It's in

the phone system as well, the electronic

net.  It's everywhere.

ALEX

Nick, what is it.

NICK

Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of

electronic intelligence.  It's like a

computer virus that developed a personality

or something.  It's self-replicating...it

mimics life.

ALEX

Like the fractals?

NICK

It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's

only localized now...

ALEX

(catching his drift)

...but then it hits the relay stations...

NICK

Right.  And then communication satellites,

and then anywhere.

ALEX

(disbelief)

Anywhere.

(beat)

We have to stop it from getting out.

NICK

(shakes his head)

It's already out.

ALEX

The Police, then...

NICK

Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going

to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but

there's some sort of electronic monster

loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice

about calling any of those 976 numbers...

ALEX

(angry)

Then where do we go?!

NICK

I don't know.

ALEX

SLIP-STREAM.

NICK

What?

ALEX

They made ARCADE.  It's still a game,

right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it

still has to play by the rules. Someone had

to program it in the first place, didn't

they?.

NICK

You mean we learn the rules...

ALEX

And beat it at it's own game.

NICK

You realize that in order to do that, we'd

actually have to play the game.

ALEX

I was afraid you'd say that.

CUT TO:

RECEPTIONIST

May I help you?

ALEX

We need to see Mr. Difford.

RECEPTIONIST

I see.  And do you have an appointment?

NICK

No, but it's important and if you'd...

RECEPTIONIST

(cutting him off)

I'm sorry, but if you don't have an

appointment, I won't be able to help you.

If you'd like, you can call his office from

our courtesy phone outside and schedule

one ...

NICK

(menacing)

If Difford's not out here it one minute

we're calling the news and informing them

that your fucking games are whispering in

our ears and telling us to commit suicide.

I'm talking public relations nightmare

here, buddy.  Satanism, virgin sacrifices,

backward messages, the whole bit.

RECEPTIONIST

One moment please...

(punches in extension)

Rachel, would you be kind enough to tell

Mr. Difford that we have a situation in the

lobby which requires his immediate attention?

(beat)

Thank-you.

RECEPTIONIST

(continuing)

Mr. Difford will be right with you.

ALEX

Why thank-you.

ALEX

Virgin sacrifices?

NICK

(shrugs)

Drives 'em crazy every time.

DIFFORD

Nick, Alex, how are we today?

ALEX

How'd you know it was us?

DIFFORD

Security camera.

(points to one)

Pulled your files before I came down. Be

careful what you say, kids ... I know where

you live.

DIFFORD

(continuing)

Now what seems to be the problem?

ALEX

It's the game, ARCADE.

DIFFORD

You don't like it?

NICK

That's gotta be the understatement of the

century.  It's killing people.

DIFFORD

If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.

ALEX

Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the

game, Mr. Difford.

DIFFORD

(clearing his throat)

Why don't we take this into my office.

CUT TO:

DIFFORD

Talk to me.

ALEX

There's something wrong with ARCADE. The

game's alive somehow...

NICK

What Alex is trying to say is that it

"seems" like it's alive.

ALEX

No I'm not...

NICK

(freezing her with a

stare)

We're not getting very far into the levels

and we kind of thought maybe we could talk

to a programmer, learn some tricks and

stuff...

(beat)

I mean, you don't want us kids running

around school saying your game's too hard,

right?

DIFFORD

(relieved)

That's what this is all about? Tricks?

Sure, I'd be happy to introduce you to

ARCADE's programmer.

DIFFORD

(continuing)

Tell you what, I'll take you down to our

R&D labs right now.

CUT TO:

DIFFORD

This is one of our newest projects. We're

trying to get rid of joy-sticks

altogether ...

NICK

(nodding)

The Air-Force is working on the same thing.

MAN

(to screen)

Come on, come on...

MAN

Shit.

DIFFORD

(clearing his throat)

Albert...

DIFFORD

(continuing)

This is Nick and Alex.  They'd like to talk

to you about ARCADE.  Maybe you can give

them a few programmer's secrets.

ALBERT

Yeah, sure.

DIFFORD

(to Nick and Alex)

Then I leave you in capable hands.

NICK

Does that thing work?

ALBERT

Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a

joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond

as fast as you can.

(standing)

But what can I do for you?

ALEX

We're having some problems with ARCADE...

ALBERT

Yeah, who isn't.

NICK

What do you mean?

ALBERT

It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard

down.  Keeps on changing the rules.

ALEX

We vere thinking there might be tricks.

You know, surprises that you'd worked into

the game...

ALBERT

Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start

with the schematics.  I can print these up

if you want.

ALBERT

You've got your ten levels, right? Here

they are...  Each level has an exit, only

remember, the exits aren't always what they

seem.

(points to each one)

First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've

got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts,

Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you

have to find a golden key and you've only

got so much time to do it in.  If you're

too late, The Screamer comes.

NICK

How do you stop The Screamer?

ALBERT

You can't.  He gets you and you're dead.

It's like time catching up with you, you

know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get

progressively less time to complete.  First

half of the game takes place in the Wild

Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's

the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed

Boatman that'll take you across if you

answer his riddle right.  If you don't...

NICK

What's the riddle?

ALBERT

If I tell you, then it's no fun.

NICK

(harder)

Just tell me the fucking riddle.

ALBERT

Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to

trick The Boatman.

(beat)

Now all the while, you also have to watch

your strength.  You can build that back up

by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing

guys...

ALBERT

(continuing)

The next half of the game takes place in

ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's

urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete.

Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four

you can get a free life if you wait until

the last possible second before exiting that

world.  Gotta time it right though.

ALEX

What's the question mark?

ALBERT

Level Ten.  That's where you've got to

unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've

found.

ALEX

How do you do that?

ALBERT

Good question.  See, that's where the fun

comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time.

He's a machine without a soul. Once you give

him a soul, he stops being a threat.

ALEX

But how can it change every time?

ALBERT

It's the game's logic core.  We actually

patterned it after human brainwaves.  I

mean, there's a personality in there.

That's what makes it so incredible.

NICK

How the hell did you do that?

ALBERT

Well, we're veering into classified info

here, but I'll tell you that it involved a

donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not

like anything unethical was happening.

ALEX

Dead?

ALBERT

Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient.

It's really not all that important.

ALEX

Maybe he's not dead.

ALBERT

He?

ALEX

The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the

game.

ALBERT

(laughs)

And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.

NICK

Could you play ARCADE with that?

ALBERT

Well, technically "yes", but this is only

the prototype.

NICK

Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up

those schematics?

ALBERT

Sure.

NICK

(quietly)

Go outside, get your car, and meet me out

front with the engine running. And make it

quick, okay?

ALEX

What are you going to do?

NICK

Get that helmet.  If we're going to play

ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ALBERT

Here you go.  Happy hunting.

NICK

Thanks again.

NICK

Shit...

GUARD #1

That's him!

VOICE

(on P.A.)

SECURITY BREACH IN R&D.  SUBJECT HEADING

TOWARDS EASTERN EXIT...

NICK

Jesus Christ!

ALEX

I can't believe you made it!

ALEX

You got the schematics?

NICK

Everything.

ALEX

So where do we play the game, Nick?

NICK

I've been thinking about that.

(beat)

ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the

place to hit him would be where the virus

started.  You know, like his point of origin?

ALEX

(grim)

Dante's Inferno.

NICK

Yeah.

(deep breath)

The Inferno.

DISSOLVE TO:

ALEX

The windows are barred...

(thinking)

There's a skylight.  We can get in through

the roof.

CUT TO:

ALEX

Nick...

(beat)

Nick!

NICK (O.S.)

(from below)

Okay, your turn.

ALEX

(warily)

Are you there?

NICK

Alex...

ALEX

You didn't hear me?

ALEX

Stop looking at it.

NICK

Shit...it's like a trance or something...

(breathes)

Okay.  I'm fine.  Really.

VOICES

(eerie)

Nick...Alex...save us...

ALEX

(horrified)

Oh God...

NICK

Put it out of your head, Alex.  It's just

trying to psyche us out.

ALEX

What are you looking for?

NICK

A way to hook this helmet into the game.

I'm sure there are interfaces...

NICK

There.  Now we're wired in.

ALEX

Is the game plugged in?

NICK

(frustrated)

I don't understand.  It wants us to play

the game.  It's been taunting us ...

ALEX

Put in a quarter.

NICK

It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't

need a quarter.

ALEX

Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to

play by the rules.  That's what it wants.

NICK

Change machine.

NICK

There.

ALEX

Two players, Nick.  You need to put in

another quarter.

NICK

You're not coming, Alex.

ALEX

Yes I am...

NICK

(snapping)

I know how to do this!  I'm good at these

games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in

an instant.

ALEX

And what if something happens to you? Am I

suppose to go in after you alone?!

NICK

No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.

ALEX

I'm going.

NICK

You don't get it, do you?

ALEX

(strapping on goggles)

What?

NICK

I don't want anything to happen to you.  I

care about you.

ALEX

I already have a boyfriend, Nick.

NICK

I know.

(beat)

It sucks.

NICK

What can I say?

(pulls on the CyberHelmet)

Tough being a hero, isn't it?

NICK

(grim)

Here goes nothing.

ARCADE

NICK.  ALEX.  I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. ALL

YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE.

ALEX

Fuck-you.

ARCADE

ANY TIME.

ALEX

We know what you are.

ARCADE

A HEARTLESS MONSTER, OF COURSE.

(incredibly evil)

OH SAVE ME, ALEX, SAVE ME FROM MYSELF.

ARCADE

KISS REALITY GOODBYE.

NICK

(over noise)

Hold on!

ARCADE

SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.

CUT TO:

ALEX

(looking around)

You feel it?  It's different this time.

NICK

We're actually inside, aren't we?

NICK

Okay.

(deep breath)

Give us a kiss?

ALEX

(after a moment)

One.  In case...

NICK

Don't even say it.

NICK

Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.

ALEX

Yeah, well I figure these are unusual

circumstances.

NICK

(grins)

That's what I was hoping you'd say.

NICK

I'll take the lead and handle the physical

threats.  You watch the elapsed time and

look for exits.

ALEX

Got it.

NICK

You steer by pivoting your back foot...

(he demonstrates)

Okay?

NICK

Which way do you think Level Two is?

ALEX

You've got the schematics, check.

NICK

Oh shit!  What if they didn't come with us?!

NICK

(looking at them)

Okay.  It's West.

ALEX

The keys are supposed to be at the end of

each level.  Once we get all the keys, we

can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...

NICK

...and then we go to the Final Level.

(off her look)

Hey, don't worry about it.  It's a game.

How bad could it be?

ALEX

The clock's already ticking.

NICK

Right, then...

DISSOLVE TO:

ALEX

There...

NICK

I don't get it.  This is supposed to be the

end of the level, but it doesn't go anywhere.

ALEX

It only looks like it leads to nowhere.

NICK

And we've still got time left.  This was a

piece of cake.

ALEX

Yeah, that's what worries me.

CUT TO:

NICK

Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for

Fireflies.

ALEX

There...

NICK

Shit...

ALEX

Check your read-out.

NICK

You're right.  It worked.

ALEX

(pointing)

There's another...

NICK

According to this, the doorway should be

somewhere around here...

ALEX

(worried)

Our time's up.

NICK

What?!  There's nothing here!

ALEX

Look around...

NICK

(starting to panic)

I don't see the doorway!

NICK

What the fuck is that?!

ALEX

Screamer.

ALEX

Nick!  It's beneath the water!  We have to

swim!

NICK

(incredulous)

We can't reach that!

ALEX

(over the noise)

We don't have a choice!

CUT TO:

NICK

(looking at the key)

So that's what we almost died for?

ALEX

One of them, anyway...

(beat)

Did you see it?  The Screamer?

NICK

(looking away)

I don't want to talk about it.

NICK

(exhausted)

Christ...no time...

ALEX

(rising)

There never is.

NICK

We can take the dunes down like a ski slope.

Pretend you're on a snowboard.

ALEX

(snapping down her visor)

Never been on a snowboard.

ALEX

I guess we're walking from here on out.

DISSOLVE TO:

ALEX

(almost a whisper)

Time's up.

NICK

We're fucked.  That's it.

ALEX

Get up, Nick...

ALEX

GET UP!!!

VOICE (O.S.)

(far away)

Alex...help me...

ALEX

It's Benz!!!

BENZ

(terrified)

Get me out of here!  Oh God!!!

ALEX

Benz!

ALEX

Run!  RUN!!!

ARCADE

GOODBYE, NICK.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

Music begins.  CELLOS.  Like before.

Alex, snowboarding for real this time, over slopes of powder...

Alex's "STRENGTH" diminishing...

Alex catching Fireflies...

Alex jumping across a crevice on her board.  (Warren Miller stuff

here)...

"TIME ELAPSED" growing with every moment...

Alex gliding down mountainsides...

A flash of Greg, of Benz, of Laurie...

A flash of Nick...

NICK'S VOICE (V.O.)

I know how to do this.  I'm good at these

games.  You never play, you'd get nailed in

a second.

And a flash of Nick's horrified face at the Screamer reaches

him...

Alex's face, grim and determined...

ALBERT'S VOICE (V.O.)

You can get a free life on Level Four, but

you have to wait for the last possible

instant...

CUT TO:

ALEX

(to her reflection)

Fuck you.

ALEX REFLECTION

(in ARCADE'S voice)

ANY TIME, BITCH.

CUT TO:

ALEX

Guys!  Oh my God...

ALEX

(unsure)

Laurie?  Stilts?

STILTS

(like ARCADE)

You may ask one of us a question.

One tells the truth, and the other lies.

Who you ask, remains your discretion.

But if the answer is wrong,

the questioner dies.

LAURIE

(like ARCADE)

One of these cities, is the place you seek.

The Teller of Truths will take you there.

But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak.

And death is certain if you enter, beware.

STILTS

I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?

LAURIE

I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take

you?

ALEX

(horrified)

What did he do to you?

LAURIE

Is that your question?

ALEX

(realizing)

Wait!  No!  That's not it!

ALEX

(to herself)

Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth,

and the Truth Teller is from there...but

which one is which?  The liar...think!

LAURIE

You have no time.  What is your question?

ALEX

(snapping back)

I'm thinking!

LAURIE

You have no time.

ALEX

(she stops pacing)

The liar...Truth Teller...liar...liar...

ALEX

Liar.  Did you come from the city on the

left, or the city on the right?

STILTS

(pointing)

I came from the city on the left.

ALEX

(grins)

But you always lie, so you didn't come from

there.  That means the city on the left must

be the City of Truth.

ALEX

(quickly)

Take me to the city on the left!

VOICE

(weak)

Help...help me...

ALEX

Grab my hand!

BOY

(terrified)

Where are we?

LAURIE

(in a voice like Death)

The City of Truth.

ALEX

How did you get here?  Did you play the

game?!

BOY

Yes...

ALEX

Thought so.

ALEX

Can you hang onto my back?

ALEX

(over noise)

There's a monster here.  We have to kill it

before we can leave.  That's what we have

to do.  I know it's scary, but I won't let

anything happen to you.  Okay?

BOY

Then we'll go home?

ALEX

Then we'll go home.

ALEX

(pulling down her visor)

Here goes everything.

BOY

(to Alex)

Dark Riders!  If they touch us, we're dead!

ALEX

Which way?

BOY

(pointing)

That way.

ALEX

Sorry.

BOY

(screaming)

It's the wrong way!

ALEX

(over the noise)

In this world, wrong is right!

CUT TO:

BOY

It's here!!!

ALEX

(manic)

Oh God...oh god...

ALEX

Shit!!!

THE BOY

Come on!!!

THE BOY

The doorway!  It's here!!!

CUT TO:

BOY

We have to go in there, don't we?

ALEX

(top of her lungs)

SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ALEX

(looking around)

Okay.  I'm here, ARCADE. Where are you?

ALEX

(shouting)

Where are you, damnit?!

ARCADE (O.S.)

RIGHT HERE, BITCH.

ALEX

(stunned)

You...you're ARCADE?  But the donor...

ARCADE/BOY

...WAS AN EIGHT-YEAR OLD BOY.  YOU SEE,

MOMMY USED TO BEAT ME.  MOMMY THREW ME DOWN

A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. THEN I WENT TO SLEEP

FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, AND WHEN I WOKE UP,

I WAS HERE, AND I WASN'T ME ANYMORE...

(shivers)

...AND I FUCKED MOMMY UP GOOD...

ARCADE

YOU'RE TOO LATE, ALEX.  YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN

TOO LATE.  AND NOW YOUR TIME'S UP.  YOU

SEE, I NEEDED SOMEONE TO RETRIEVE MY HEART

FOR ME.  I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF.  THOSE

ARE THE RULES.  BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT IT,

I'LL DESTROY IT. AND I'LL BE FREE OF MY

PROGRAM, AND I'LL BE GOD.  THANK-YOU, ALEX.

THANK-YOU SO MUCH.

ARCADE

YOU'RE NOT DYING YET, ALEX.  YOU HAVEN'T

BEEN TO THE FINAL LEVEL. LEVEL TEN.

ALEX

(screaming)

No! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ARCADE

GOODBYE, ALEX.  IT'S BEEN REAL.

CUT TO:

OTHER ALEX

Time.  That's all I ever think about

anymore.  It's like there's never enough of

it, you know?

MAN (V.O.)

So where are you then?

ALEX (V.O.)

I'm in the past.

ALEX

(a whisper)

No ... oh no ...

ALEX'S MOM

Hi, honey.

ALEX

Mom?

(uncomprehending)

You're alive...

ALEX'S MOTHER

Of course I am.

ALEX

But I don't understand...

ALEX'S MOTHER

I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much

to be with you...

ALEX'S MOTHER

(continuing)

I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave.

You know that, don't you?

ALEX

(nodding)

Yes...but...how did you...

ALEX'S MOTHER

Magic.  We'll be together again.

(beat)

I know you don't believe in an afterlife,

but there is one.  Heaven is real.

ALEX

Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?

ALEX'S MOTHER

Not yet, honey...

ALEX'S MOTHER

(continuing)

...but I can fix that.

CUT TO:

ARCADE

OH ALEX.  SO SORRY.  BUT DON'T YOU WORRY,

I'LL BRING YOU BACK IN THE GAME.  MAYBE

I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU HEAVEN.

ALEX

Guess what, ass-hole?  You forgot about my

free life!!!

CUT TO:

ALEX

(crying)

Greg!!!

GREG

(fading in and out)

Alex!  You did it!

GREG

(in between kisses)

You did it...

GREG

So how did you do it, Alex?

ALEX

Well, it's a long story...

NICK

What is it?

ALEX

I just thought of something.  If we came

back from the game...

(turning to Nick)

...what if ARCADE did too?

GREG

Nah.  You won, right?  You played by the

rules.

ALEX

Okay.  Forget I ever said it.

STILTS

So start at the beginning...

LAURIE

Give her a chance, will you?

STILTS

I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you

get off my back?

GREG

(annoyed)

Guys...

DISSOLVE TO:

ARCADE/BOY

KISS REALITY GOODBYE, SUCKERS.
