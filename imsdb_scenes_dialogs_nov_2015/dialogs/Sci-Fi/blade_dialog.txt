BLADE - by David S. Goyer

BLADE

by

David S. Goyer

NURSE #1

(with stethoscope)

She's not breathing!

SENIOR RESIDENT

Intubate her!

RESIDENT

Blood-pressure's forty and falling --

SENIOR RESIDENT

Jesus, her water's broken --

(calling for help)

She's going into uterine contractions --

DENNIS

So where we going?

RAQUEL

It's a surprise.

DENNIS

I likes surprises.

RAQUEL

What do you have down there, little

man?

DENNIS

Heat-seeker.

RAQUEL

I'll bet.

DENNIS

What the fuck are we doing here?

DENNIS

(over the music)

Fuck, I need a drink!!!

RAQUEL

What's wrong, baby?

BLADE

Where is Deacon Frost?

BLADE

Got something in your throat.

QUINN

Fuck you, Day-walker, I ain't saying

shit --

BLADE

Frost.

QUINN

You won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's

rising, the Sleeper's gonna --

DENNIS

Please don't --

ASSISTANT

Brought you a baked potato, nice

and crispy. Still warm, too.

CURTIS

Jesus, that's rank --

CURTIS

What's his story?

ASSISTANT

Paramedics said he was still screaming

when they found him. Looks like some

joker had stapled him to a wall.

CURTIS

Pretty.

KAREN

You took this off a DOA?

KAREN

This isn't human blood.

CURTIS

Then what is it?

KAREN

I don't know --

(re: microscope)

Look at this blood smear --

KAREN

The red blood cells are biconvex,

which is theoretically impossible.

They're hypochromic, there's virtually

no hemoglobin in them.

(shaking her head)

Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated,

they should be mononucleated.

CURTIS

What about the chemistry panel?

JULIE

Blood sugar level is three times the

norm, phosphorous and uric acid are

off the scales.

(shrugs)

Like the woman said, impossible.

KAREN

Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm

really not in the mood for one of your

practical jokes.

CURTIS

(insistent)

It's not a joke. I've got the stiff

sitting in the morgue right now --

look, just come up and see him, okay?

Five minutes, that's all I ask.

KAREN

I thought you promised to give me some

distance?

CURTIS

This is purely professional curiosity,

Karen, I swear.

KAREN

Five minutes, not a second more. And I

don't want to hear a word about "us".

CURTIS

No problem.

KAREN

You haven't started in on the internal

organs?

CURTIS

Just the blood sample from the

pericardial sac.

CURTIS

That's weird --

KAREN

What?

CURTIS

He looks different now, burns are less

extreme, some of these wounds have

closed up --

CURTIS

Tell me something, honestly, you ever

have second thoughts about us?

KAREN

(grudgingly)

Sometimes --

KAREN

-- but then I remember what an

ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back

to reality.

CURTIS

Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart

here --

QUINN

(crazed by thirst)

-- more -- blood --

BLADE

Now don't we look dapper?

UNIFORM #1

Hold it, ass-hole!

UNIFORM #1

I said hold it!!!

KAREN

(gasping)

My shoulder -- dislocated --

BLADE

Whistler!

WHISTLER (O.S.)

Are we bringing home strays now?

BLADE

She's been bitten.

WHISTLER

You should've killed her, then.

BLADE

She hasn't turned yet.

(pointedly)

You can help her.

WHISTLER

No promises. You watch her close. She

starts to turn, you finish her off.

WHISTLER

Localized necrosis. She's borderline.

Another hour and she'd be well into

the change.

WHISTLER

Can you hear me, woman?

KAREN

What -- ?

WHISTLER

You've been bitten by a vampire. We've

got to try and burn out the venom,

just like a rattlesnake bite --

WHISTLER

Hold her.

WHISTLER

(reading her name tag)

"Dr. Karen Jansen". Listen close, I'm

going to inject you with an antidote

made from allium setivum -- garlic.

This is going to hurt. A lot.

DRAGONETTI

(subtitled)

Blade. Once again, our interests have

fallen victim to his ridiculous

crusade. He must be destroyed.

FROST (O.S.)

(in English)

You're wrong, Dragonetti.

FROST

The Day Walker represents a unique

opportunity. We'd be fools to waste

it by killing him.

DRAGONETTI

(subtitled, taking umbrage)

Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our

language, you insult the House of

Erebus by using the humans'

gutter-tongue, have you no respect

for tradition?

FROST

Why should I respect something which

has outlived its purpose?

DRAGONETTI

(simmering)

I see. And what would you have us do

with this "half-breed"?

FROST

Study him. Unlock the secrets of his

DNA. He's the key we've been looking

for.

DRAGONETTI

He is an abomination!

FROST

Why should we spend our lives

cringing from the daylight when his

blood offers us an alternative?

Enough talk. It's time we stepped out

of the shadows!

PALLINTINE

You're out of line, Frost.

FROST

Am I? Or am I just the first to say

out loud what we've all been

thinking?

DRAGONETTI

The shadows suit us, Frost. We've

existed this way for thousands of

years. Who are you to challenge our

ways?

FROST

Someone who's sick of living off

scraps. The coming age belongs to us,

not the humans!

(to the others)

When the final war between our races

comes, who do you want leading the

charge?

FROST

Some withered up fossil ready to snap

like a brittle bone at the first sign

of change?

DRAGONETTI

Get out!!!

FROST

Careful, old fang. You might wake up

one day and find yourself extinct.

WHISTLER

I had to increase the dose. You're

building up a resistance to the

serum --

BLADE

(impatient)

Just do it, old man.

BLADE

You shouldn't be here.

KAREN

I'm sorry, I --

WHISTLER (O.S.)

Wandered off the beaten path, Doctor?

KAREN

Who are you people?

WHISTLER

My name is Abraham Whistler.

(re: Blade)

This is Blade. As for our little

homunculus here --

BLADE

-- he's a vampire.

KAREN

You're joking --

WHISTLER

Not at all. You're looking at a prime

specimen of the homines nocturna.

WHISTLER

If Blade hadn't brought you here, you

would've wound up like him.

KAREN

Why did you help me?

BLADE

Stupidity.

WHISTLER

(appraising her)

Maybe not. I did some checking, she's

a hematologist. Knowledge like that

might come in handy.

BLADE

It's not worth the risk. We can't

trust her.

KAREN

Why?

BLADE

Because you're tainted. The venom's

still inside you. You could still

turn on us.

KAREN

What happens then?

BLADE

Then I have to take you out, just

like any other bloodsucker.

BLADE

We hunt them, moving from one city to

the next, tracking their migrations.

They're hard to kill. They tend to

regenerate.

KAREN

(sarcastic)

So what do you use, then? A stake?

WHISTLER

(nodding)

Some of the old wives' tales are true

-- they're severely allergic to

silver, various types of wood. Feed

them garlic and they'll go into

anaphylactic shock --

WHISTLER

-- and of course there's always

sunlight, ultra-violet rays.

KAREN

And you honestly expect me to believe

all this?

BLADE

I don't care what you believe. I

saved your life once, I don't plan on

making a habit of it. You want my

advice, you'll be out of the city by

nightfall. If you're stupid enough to

stay, that's your business.

KAREN

I can't just leave. I have a life

here, a career --

BLADE

Not anymore. You've seen one of them.

You won't be allowed to live after

that.

WHISTLER

There's a war going on out there.

Blade, myself, a few others -- we've

tried to keep it from spilling over

onto the streets.

(beat)

Sometimes people like yourself get

caught in the cross-fire.

KAREN

I can go to the police. I have blood

samples back at the hospital. I can

show them.

BLADE

Do it. You'll be dead before you can

file the complaint.

KAREN

That's ridiculous! No one's that

powerful.

WHISTLER

You're talking about a brotherhood

that predates the Catholic Church by

thousands of years. Their survival

depends on their ability to blend in.

Chances are, you've encountered them

and not even known it. On the subway,

in a bar --

BLADE

Get in. Youre leaving.

WHISTLER

Wait.

WHISTLER

Consider it a parting gift. Vampire

mace -- silver nitrate, essence of

garlic.

KAREN

(in disbelief)

So that's it? You guys just patch me

up and send me on my way?

WHISTLER

There is one other thing. I'd buy

yourself a gun if I were you. If you

start becoming sensitive to the

daylight, if you start becoming

thirsty regardless of much you've had

to drink -- then I suggest you take

that gun and use it on yourself.

Better that, than the alternative.

DRAGONETTI (O.S.)

What are you doing here?

DRAGONETTI

(outraged)

These archives are restricted to

members of the House of Erebus.

FROST

Please. You and the other Elders

wouldn't know what to do with these

texts if your lives depended on it.

(cryptically)

Which, of course, they do.

DRAGONETTI

You're wasting your time, Frost. Far

greater scholars than you have tried

to decipher these words. Whatever

secrets they hold have been lost.

FROST

Perhaps.

DRAGONETTI

What are you up to, Frost?

FROST'S VOICE

Wouldn't you like to know, Old Fang?

BLADE

Remember what we said. Keep your eyes

open. They're everywhere.

KAREN

I need the police. This is an

emergency --

KAREN

Hello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was

with Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital

last night -- that's right, I

witnessed the attack --

(listening)

115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I'll

wait here. Please hurry.

KAREN

Get a grip on yourself, girl.

KAREN

Who is it?

GIDEON

Sergeant Gideon. I'm responding to a

911 call.

KAREN

Yes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen --

GIDEON

Are you all right?

(off Karen's nod)

I'm glad you called, Ms. Jansen, we've

been anxious to get a hold of you. You

disappeared on us for a while.

KAREN

I know. Listen -- do you have any idea

what happened to Curtis, the other

doctor?

GIDEON

(matter of fact)

Oh, he's dead. But I wouldn't worry

about that if I were you.

KAREN

(alarmed)

Why?

GIDEON

Because you're dead too.

GIDEON

Garlic?

KAREN

He said it would work against

vampires --

GIDEON

Who said I was a vampire?

GIDEON

Thanks for the laugh. You can shut

your eyes if you want to.

BLADE

You okay?

KAREN

How did you know?

BLADE

Figured they'd send someone after you.

Thought I'd wait around and see who

showed up.

KAREN

You used me as bait?!

BLADE

It worked, didn't it?

KAREN

But, he could've --

BLADE

He didn't. Get over it.

KAREN

But he's a policeman --

BLADE

He's a familiar. A human who works for

the vampires. See this mark?

BLADE

That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire

cattle brand. That means Officer

Friendly here is someone's property.

Any of the other vampire's try to

bleed him, they'll have to answer to

Friendly's owner --

(studying the glyph)

This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost.

We've been tracking him for a while

now --

KAREN

Why in God's name would anyone want to

work for them?

BLADE

Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If

they're loyal, if they prove

themselves, then their masters will

turn them.

KAREN

And that's a good thing?

BLADE

For some. Live forever, never get old.

The ultimate high.

BLADE

How 'bout you, Officer? You a good

little bloodhound?

BLADE

Looks like our friend was

blood-running.

(to Gideon)

Where were you headed?

GIDEON

Mphuck you --

GIDEON

Jesus -- 1227 Brookner --

Holliston Clinic --

KAREN

What are you doing?!

BLADE

Preventive medicine.

KAREN

You can't do this, he's human, it's

murder.

BLADE

It's war, now get the fuck out of the

way!

BLADE

God-damnit!!! Do you have any idea

what you just did?! He'll warn them.

They'll be waiting!

KAREN

You were going to kill him. What was I

supposed to do?! Shut my eyes and

pretend I didn't see what I saw?

BLADE

Let me set you straight on something,

Doctor. What you've "seen" so far is

nothing. The world you live in's just

the sugar-coated topping. There's

another world beneath it, the real

world -- and it's a fucking bloodbath.

If you want to survive in it, you'd

better pull your head out of your ass.

GIDEON

Look, I know you're disappointed --

FROST

Crestfallen.

GIDEON

Blade was waiting for me. There wasn't

anything I could do.

FROST

Tell me something, Gideon, what blood

type are you?

GIDEON

I don't really know --

FROST

Take a wild stab. A? B? O, perhaps?

I'm interested in the antigens here,

the agglutination reaction --

FROST

I'm going to guess AB positive.

FROST

AB positive. Give the man a prize.

BLADE

What the hell are you doing?! I could

have killed you!

KAREN

I remembered the address. I followed

you --

BLADE

Do you have a death wish or are you

just stupid?

KAREN

Look, if what you say is true, if

there's a chance I could turn into one

of them, then I've got no choice, do

I? I have to work with you. I need to

learn everything I can about them.

It's the only way I'll be able to find

a cure for myself.

BLADE

There is no cure.

KAREN

(defiant)

You don't know that.

KAREN

What are you looking at?

BLADE

(gesturing)

What do you see here?

KAREN

Graffiti --

BLADE

Look closer.

BLADE

This isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire

marking. It means there's a safe-house

nearby.

A place they can go if dawn is coming.

KAREN

(recognizing it)

I know this place -- it's a blood

bank.

BLADE

Owned by vampires. There's one of

these in every major city, and just

like Domino's, they always deliver.

(looking to Karen)

You telling me you're ready to walk

through that door?

BLADE

All right, then, listen up, Vampire

Anatomy 101. Crosses and running water

don't do dick, so forget what you've

seen in the movies.

BLADE

You use the stake, silver, or

sunlight, got it?

BLADE

Know how to use one of these?

KAREN

No.

BLADE

Safety's off, round's already

chambered --

(cocking it)

Silver hollow-points filled with

garlic. You aim for the heart or the

head, anything else is a one-way

ticket to a pine box.

BLADE

Get out. Now.

BLADE

I know you're blood-running. Who's

your sponsor?

TANAKA

I don't know what you're --

KAREN

What if you've made a mistake?

BLADE

What's this? A birthmark?

BLADE

(to Karen)

Still think we might be wrong?

(to Tanaka)

How much are you shipping?

TANAKA

Bite me!

BLADE

I've got a message for your masters --

the night's no longer safe for their

kind.

KAREN

You let him go --

(off Blade's nod)

An hour ago you were ready to kill a

man for less, this one didn't even

talk.

BLADE

He will.

AUTOMATED VOICE

(filtered, on scanner)

"You've reached a number that is no

longer in service. Please consult your

operator and try again".

TANAKA'S VOICE

(filtered, on scanner)

It's Tanaka, PIN number

sixteen-zero-zero-nine --

VOICE

(filtered, on scanner)

Yes?

TANAKA

Get me Pearl!

VOICE

(filtered, on speaker)

Pearl is feeding --

TANAKA

Look, I'm not fucking around here!

That hunter Frost has been talking

about? He was just at the clinic. Tore

the goddamn place apart!

BLADE

Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place

is crawling with them.

(pointing)

See the valets over there? They're

vampires. So is the doorman.

KAREN

How can you tell?

BLADE

The way they move, they way they

smell --

BLADE

The whore on the corner, she's one

too. So are the two men standing under

the streetlight.

KAREN

So many of them -- I still can't

believe they're real.

BLADE

There are worse things than vampires

out there.

KAREN

Like what?

BLADE

(pumping his shotgun)

Like me.

DOORMAN

I'm sorry, sir -- do you have an

invitation?

KID

Hey --

BLADE

Where's the entrance?!

TANAKA

I can't -- they'll kill me!

BLADE

I got news for you, butt-boy. You're

already dead.

TANAKA

(terrified)

Oh God, shit -- behind the bookcase --

BLADE

After you.

KAREN

What is this place?

BLADE

Some kind of archive --

KAREN

Isn't this all a little high-tech? I

thought vampires were more into

cobwebs and coffins.

BLADE

You've been watching too much TV.

They've got their claws sunk into

everything -- finance, real estate,

politics. Probably own half of

Downtown.

BLADE

This must be where they keep their

records --

PEARL'S VOICE

(frightened)

Lorca, is that you?

PEARL

(into a speakerphone)

He's here!

FROST'S VOICE

(over speakerphone)

Congratulations, Day-Walker.

BLADE

Frost?

FROST

In the flesh, Blade. I understand

you've been looking for me. I'm

flattered.

BLADE

(eyeballing Pearl)

Don't be. You're another notch on my

sword hilt, nothing else.

FROST

You're quick, Blade, I'll give you

that. In the space of an hour you've

crossed my familiar, destroyed a blood

bank --

(beat)

Now here you are in the heart of our

archives, terrorizing our curator.

PEARL'S VOICE

He has a knife to my throat, Frost!

He --

FROST

(cutting him off)

You're history, Pearl. Have the good

grace to die with some dignity.

(beat)

Round one to you, Blade.

PEARL

What is that?

BLADE

A sun lamp. We're gonna play twenty

questions. Depending on your answers,

you might get to have yourself a

tanning session.

BLADE

What were you in such a big hurry to

delete just now?

PEARL

(relenting)

It's an epistle, a letter Frost has

been translating -- it prophesizes

LaMagra's return.

BLADE

And who is LaMagra?

PEARL

LaMagra is The Sleeper!!!

BLADE

Where's the original, Pearl? You must

have it around here somewhere.

PEARL

The vault --

BLADE

If he moves, cook him.

PEARL

Please, I'll give you the combination

-- you'll damage the documents --

BLADE

That's the point.

KAREN

He moved.

KAREN

What are these?

QUINN (o.s.)

Curiosity killed the cat.

QUINN

(grins)

Hola, amigo. Remember me?

QUINN

You took my arm, Blade. But that's

okay, I'm growing a new one --

QUINN

Nice, huh? Think I'll ever play the

piano again?

(shrugging)

You can slice him, you can dice him,

and the man just keeps on coming.

QUINN

Stay with me, sweetness, I'm not

through with you yet.

QUINN

Teak. Nice craftsmanship.

(to the others)

Now here's a man who takes his job

just a little too seriously, don't you

think?

(back to Blade)

Which reminds me, Blade, think I owe

you one --

QUINN

Actually, if you want to get

technical, I owe you two.

QUINN

What's so funny, bright eyes?

BLADE

I'm expecting some company.

VOICE

(filtered)

Get down!

WHISTLER

Christ, I'm too old for this. Somebody

get me a goddamn wheelchair.

KAREN

How did you find us?!

WHISTLER

We keep in radio contact.

KAREN

(incredulous)

You've been listening in the whole

time?

WHISTLER

You think I'd let him run loose

without a chaperone? Blade ferrets

their rat-holes out, I map them. Then

we blow them all to kingdom come.

WHISTLER

There's a subway line due East of

here. We'd best make tracks.

KAREN

Whistler!

WHISTLER

Go on, I'll be fine!

BLADE

He can take care of himself! GO!!!

KAREN

You're hurt --

BLADE

Nothing that won't heal by dawn.

BLADE

(frustrated)

I need help with this --

KAREN

What am I injecting you with?

BLADE

(weakly)

Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin

substitute.

KAREN

You're one of them, aren't you?

BLADE

Not quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human,

half-vampire.

WHISTLER

What took you so long?

BLADE

Don't even start, old man.

KAREN

Why didn't you tell me the truth

about him?

WHISTLER

We weren't sure we could trust you.

WHISTLER

Blade's mother was attacked by a

vampire while she was pregnant.

Ultimately, she died, but her unborn

child lived. Unfortunately, he'd

undergone certain genetic changes

while in the womb --

WHISTLER

I found Blade when he was thirteen.

He'd been living on the streets,

feeding off the homeless. Apparently

the Thirst manifested itself at

puberty --

(beat)

I took him for one of them at first,

almost killed him, too. But then I

realized what he was.

QUINN

He took my fucking hand! Again!

FROST

You seem to be in the habit of losing

them fairly often, Quinn. Maybe the

amputee lifestyle just suits you.

QUINN

We need to find him, tonight.

FROST

Down, boy. Blade's not going anywhere.

I promise. Right now, though, we've

more pressing business --

(off Mercury's look)

It's time Dragonetti paid the piper.

WHISTLER

Blade's unique, you know. A one in a

billion anomaly. He can withstand

sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he

still has the Thirst.

KAREN

What happens if he doesn't take the

serum?

WHISTLER

The Thirst overcomes him, just like

the others. It's not something he can

control.

(sighs)

The problem is, time's running out.

His body's starting to reject the

serum. And so far, all my efforts to

find a cure have ended in failure --

KAREN

No offense, Whistler, but you're not

exactly working with state of the art

equipment here. You might have missed

something.

WHISTLER

(pointedly)

Which is why you're here. We could use

someone with your experience.

WHISTLER

This used to be mine, you know. It's

been passed down through the

centuries, from one hunter to the

next --

KAREN

Why do you hunt them?

WHISTLER

Habit, mostly, just like this.

WHISTLER

I had a family once -- a wife, three

daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon

Frost came calling one evening --

KAREN

He killed them?

WHISTLER

Eventually. He toyed with them first.

He made me choose, do you understand?

Which order they would die in --

KAREN

How did you escape?

WHISTLER

I didn't. He was cruel enough to let

me live.

(slapping his brace)

Even gave me a souvenir to remember

him by.

KAREN

And now you're using Blade to exact

your revenge?

WHISTLER

(pointedly)

Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and

I'm not getting any younger, am I?

WHISTLER

I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

It's best to leave him alone when he's

like this.

KAREN

I'll take my chances.

KAREN

Blade?

KAREN

It's dark in here.

BLADE

You get used to the darkness.

KAREN

Whistler told me about your mother.

BLADE

I can't close my eyes without hearing

her scream.

KAREN

Those aren't real memories. No one has

that kind of recall.

BLADE

I do. I remember from day one. People

staring at me, sensing I was

different. Watching the fear grow in

their eyes, knowing in their hearts I

wasn't human.

KAREN

If you're not human, then why do you

bleed like us?

I've seen vampire blood, you don't

have it running through your veins.

BLADE

Just get out of here.

KAREN

Blade --

BLADE

I said, GET OUT!!!

FROST'S VOICE

Rise and shine, little wing.

DRAGONETTI

(straining)

What is this? Where am I?!

FROST

When was the last time you stopped to

appreciate a sunrise, Dragonetti?

Three, four hundred years?

FROST

How do you like that? Right on time.

DRAGONETTI

(snarling)

The other elders will never let you

get away with this!

DRAGONETTI

(subtitled)

Don't you see, you fools?! He'll

betray you too! He's planning on

invoking LaMagra himself!

FROST

The wheel turns, old fang. Guess you

just got a little too long in the

tooth.

FROST

Dragonetti was right. You were fools

to trust me.

WHISTLER

Going somewhere?

BLADE

China Town. I need more serum.

(re: new equipment)

What's all this?

KAREN

I made a trip to the hospital last

night, borrowed some equipment.

BLADE

(sarcastic)

For your miracle cure?

WHISTLER

She's been making real progress,

Blade.

(to Karen)

Show him --

KAREN

This is sodium citrate. It's an

anti-coagulant. We use it to treat

blood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood

is thinner than humans, though. Watch

what happens when I introduce some

into a sample --

WHISTLER

Can you imagine what a dash of that

would do on your sword?

KAREN

Before you go, I'd like to take a

sample of your blood.

KAREN

Is he sick?

BLADE

Cancer.

KAREN

You care about him, don't you?

BLADE

We've got a good arrangement, that's

all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use

them, the vampires die -- end of

story.

KAREN

(pointedly)

My mother used to say that a cold

heart is a dead heart.

BLADE

Your mother sounds like a Hallmark

greeting card.

BLADE

I'd wish you luck, Doc, but I never

put much stock in optimism.

BLADE

How's it going, Kam?

KAM

(re: calendar)

You're a week early.

BLADE

I was in the neighborhood.

BLADE

Whistler says I'm building up a

resistance to it.

KAM

I was afraid that might happen.

BLADE

Maybe it's time to start exploring

other alternatives.

KAM

There's only one alternative to the

serum.

BLADE

Yeah. I know.

BLADE

Thanks, Kam.

(thinking)

One other thing. Have you ever heard

of a vampire called the Sleeper?

BLADE

I found this in there archives. I need

to find someone who can read their

language.

KAM

I've heard about a woman named

Miracia. Some say she's a mayombero, a

Santeria witch. Supposedly she lives

in that tent community down by the

city dump. I'm told she only sees

people at night.

VOICE (o.s.)

Blade.

VOICE (o.s.)

Blade.

MAN

Afternoon, Blade.

FROST

Easy.

FROST

Wouldn't want our little friend here

to wind up on the back of a milk

carton, would we?

FROST

Beautiful day, isn't it?

BLADE

(confused)

How can you be out here?

FROST

I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical

research. We've developed a type of

sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a

few others things.

FROST

It's not very effective in direct

sunlight, but it's a start. The goal,

of course, is to be like you, "the

Day-walker".

BLADE

I don't buy it.

FROST

Why not? The future of our race runs

through your bloodstream. You've got

the best of both worlds, Blade. All of

our strengths and none of our

weaknesses.

BLADE

Maybe I don't see it that way.

FROST

Oh, so it's back to pretending we're

human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle

Tom routine. You can't keep denying

what you are. You're one of us, Blade.

You always have been.

BLADE

You're wrong.

FROST

Am I? You think the humans will ever

accept a half-breed like you? They

can't. They're afraid of you.

(pointedly)

The humans fear us because we're

superior. They fear us because in

their hearts they know their race has

become obsolete.

FROST

Look at them, just an endless stream

of cattle in a mad race to the

slaughterhouse.

FROST

The pause that refreshes --

(offering it to Blade)

Care for some? Smells good, doesn't

it? Pungent, with just an

irrepressible hint of iron.

BLADE

Pass.

FROST

You sure now? I bled a newborn for

this. You won't find a drink that's

sweeter.

FROST

Tell me honestly, do you really get

the same rush from that pasteurized

piss-serum of yours?

(off Blade's look)

You're surprised I know about your

serum? You shouldn't be. I know

everything about you.

FROST

You can't keep walking the razor's

edge, Blade. The day will come -- and

soon, when you'll have to choose

between our kind and their's. If I

were you, I'd take care not to wind up

on the wrong end of the fang.

FROST

Love to continue this chat, but it

appears I'm melting.

BLADE

You're not going anywhere.

FROST

(growling)

Watch me.

MERCURY

(into radio)

This is Mercury. Tell Deacon I've

found their hiding place.

BLADE

Any progress?

KAREN

Some. It's been slow --

BLADE

You don't look so good.

KAREN

I'm just tired, that's all. We've been

up all night.

KAREN

Excuse me.

BLADE (O.S.)

It's started.

BLADE

You've got another day or two at most.

BLADE

For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

KAREN

You make it sound like I'm already

dead.

MAN

Extranjero. Quien es?

BLADE

I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me.

WOMAN

This way.

KAREN

All right, let's start with the basics

-- why do vampires need to drink

blood?

WHISTLER

Their own blood can't sustain

hemoglobin.

KAREN

Then vampirism is a genetic defect,

just like Hemolytic anemia?

KAREN

So what about gene therapy?

KAREN

Basically you'd have to re-write the

victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA

will produce proteins capable of

generating hemoglobin.

WHISTLER

How?

KAREN

With a retrovirus. It's injected into

the bone marrow cells, it causes the

host's DNA to mutate. They've been

using them to treat Sickle-cell

anemia.

WHISTLER

You're serious? You actually think

this could work?

KAREN

On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so

sure --

(gravely)

The problem is, Blade didn't contract

the vampire virus from a bite like I

did. He was born with it. The irony

is, I could probably cure every

vampire but him.

WHISTLER

Then we're back to square one, aren't

we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always

wins.

KAREN

What happened to the power?

WHISTLER

(concerned)

I don't know, but the back-up

generator should've kicked in.

WHISTLER

UV floodlights are down too.

WHISTLER

Get it!!!

WHISTLER

Understand this -- they are monsters.

Hesitate for even a moment, and you've

lost.

FROST (O.S.)

Words to live by, Whistler.

FROST

It's been a long time, hasn't it, "old

friend"?

MIRACIA

Is something wrong, my friend?

BLADE

You're blind --

MIRACIA

There are other ways to see. Sit.

MIRACIA

Perhaps you have brought me something

-- an offering for the orishas?

MIRACIA

Hold out your hands.

BLADE

I didn't come here to get my palms

read. I need something translated.

MIRACIA

Show me.

MIRACIA

Sangre. Written in blood.

MIRACIA

This is an old tongue, from an old

world. It concerns LaMagra.

BLADE

Who is LaMagra?

MIRACIA

The vampire God. This speaks of His

return.

MIRACIA

"-- there will come a Day Walker."

(reading)

"His blood will call the Sleeper from

beyond the Veil of Tears."

BLADE

His blood -- ?

MIRACIA

The Day Walker's blood is a disparador

-- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's

return. One need only consume it and

the spirit of his ancestors will

settle upon him.

(reading)

"And the Sleeper will rise from the

shadows anew, cleansing the world in a

Tide of Blood."

BLADE

(recalling the phrase)

"The Blood Tide".

MIRACIA

(nodding)

Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is

said that all who feel its taint will

succumb to the Thirst.

BLADE

How do I stop it?

MIRACIA

The Great Wheel turns, my friend. The

Dark is rising. How would you fight a

shadow?

MIRACIA

I am tired. Dawn is coming.

BLADE

But I just got here --

MIRACIA

You've been here longer than you

think.

BLADE

WHISTLER?!

BLADE

Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to

you?

WHISTLER

Frost took her --

BLADE

Don't try to talk --

WHISTLER

Listen. You have to -- finish me off.

You don't want me coming back.

BLADE

No, we can treat the wounds --

WHISTLER

Too far gone, you know that.

BLADE

Whistler, I can't.

WHISTLER

Yes you can. Now get on with it.

BLADE

Whistler, I --

WHISTLER

(cutting him off, more gentle now)

I know.

(forcing a smile)

Just be quick about it, will you? Do

it right.

FROST

Hello, Blade. By the time you watch

this, Whistler will no doubt be

winging his way to Heaven, thanks to

your capable hands. If it makes any

difference to you, he put up quite a

fight.

FROST

Now, I'm sure you're wondering about

Ms. Jansen's well-being. She's alive

and kicking -- "ambulatory", as they

like to say in the trade. Whether or

not she remains so is entirely up to

you.

(beat)

I'll make this as easy as possible for

you, Blade. You can find us at the

Edgewood Towers. We'll be waiting with

baited breath.

FROST

Well, here we are, Doctor.

KAREN

Why haven't you killed me yet?

MERCURY

Deacon likes to play with his food

before he eats it.

KAREN

How many of you are there?

FROST

A few thousand scattered about the

globe. In the past, we've had to

restrict our numbers for fear of

discovery. That won't be necessary

after tonight.

KAREN

What happens then?

FROST

The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied

holy war against the humans. There's a

force, you see -- a spirit that exists

in our blood. I've discovered a way to

invoke it.

KAREN

LaMagra --

FROST

That's right. The answers were there

all along, of course, scribbled down

in the forgotten languages of my kind.

Waiting for someone with the patience

to decipher them.

My elders were foolish enough to

dismiss them as wives tales. But I

knew better.

(beat)

Imagine my surprise when Blade turned

out to be the key which would set that

force free.

FROST

LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a

spirit, requiring a flesh and blood

host in order to manifest himself.

KAREN

You.

FROST

Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?

KAREN

There's no need for any of this. Your

condition can be treated. Whistler and

I were working on a cure when --

FROST

What makes you think we want to be

cured? Blood is only part of the

equation. The hunt, the killing,

that's what the Thirst is really

about.

KAREN

But you use blood banks --

FROST

Only as a last resort. Preserved blood

is inferior. There's no flavor left to

it, no life.

(rising from his seat)

Fortunately, I've found a way around

that particular obstacle.

FROST

Under these conditions I can keep a

donor alive for years, producing

anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints

of blood.

(admiring his charges)

Of course, this is just a pilot

program, really. Once the Tide comes,

we'll need to expand production. So

many more mouths to feed --

KAREN

You're a monster.

FROST

Why? Because we live at another

species' expense? Your people farm

cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening

them up with steroids? It's called

evolution, Doctor. Survival of the

fittest.

FROST

I have a wake-up call for the human

race. You're no longer at the top of

the food chain.

VAMPIRE

You think I'm afraid of that toothpick

of yours?

BLADE

You should be. I've made some

improvements.

VANESSA

Jason.

BLADE

Mother -- ?!

VANESSA

I've missed you so much, Jason.

(drawing closer)

You have no idea what I've been

through, how much I've wanted to see

you --

BLADE

But you -- died --

VANESSA

(a hellish smile)

Deacon brought me back.

BLADE

Fight him --

FROST

She can't. She's one of my thralls

now. She has about as much free will

as a puppet on a string.

(looking at Vanessa)

You love me, don't you, Vanessa?

VANESSA

Yes.

FROST

What do we have here? Your precious

serum? I don't think you'll be needing

this anymore.

BLADE

Please --

VANESSA

Listen to your father, Jason. It's

going to be a better world.

FROST

Don't look so surprised, Blade. You've

spent your life looking for the

vampire who fathered you. Well you can

rest easy now, you've found him.

(gripping Blade's chin)

Daddy's here.

FROST

It's true, Blade. You've got my blood

running through your veins.

(smiling)

Thirty years ago. A moonlit street, a

woman on her way home alone. You were

conceived the night I tore my fangs

into your mother's flesh.

KAREN

Are you all right?

BLADE

(weakly)

I've been better --

BLADE

How long have we been driving?

KAREN

(shaking her head)

I don't know. I woke up just before

you did --

KAREN

Is it bad?

BLADE

(nodding)

We get out of this alive, maybe I'll

take that miracle cure of yours.

KAREN

(quietly)

It won't work on you.

BLADE

What are you talking about?

KAREN

Your condition's congenital, the

genetic mutations occurred in utero.

All the other victims contracted

vampirism after birth.

KAREN

I can't cure you, Blade. I can cure

myself, but I can't cure you.

(beat)

I'm so sorry.

FROST

Welcome home, children.

FROST

On its surface, this building houses

one of the city's oldest financial

institutions -- and for over

two-hundred years its served our

corporate needs. Look beneath the

surface, however, and you'll discover

another truth entirely --

FROST

As above, so below.

FROST

Welcome to our hall of ancients,

Doctor. We call it the Temple of

Night.

FROST

Let's see this sword of his.

FROST

Still quite sharp, I see.

KAREN

Blade --

FROST

You're wasting your breath, woman. He

can't hear you now. It's the Thirst,

you see? It already has him in its

grip.

FROST

How long has it been since you had

your serum? Twelve hours? More? You

must be quite thirsty by now.

FROST

What does it feel like? Is your blood

on fire? Are you burning up inside?

Give in to the Thirst, Blade. Embrace

your true nature.

BLADE

-- go to hell --

FROST

I've got news for you, Blade. We're

already here.

FROST

Take him to the sanctuary. It's time

he was bled.

FROST

I'd let you watch the proceedings,

Doctor, but I'm afraid that privilege

is reserved for members of my own

race. Don't worry, though, I've made

alternate arrangements for you.

FROST

We call this the Bone Pit. It's where

we keep our mistakes, the ones who

couldn't successfully make the

transition from human to vampire.

FROST

They'll feed on anything, given the

chance -- animals, corpses, even other

vampires.

FROST

Of course, a strapping young woman

like yourself -- well I think you just

might be considered finger food.

FROST

It's been a long road, hasn't it? Such

a pity Whistler led you so far astray.

FROST

I don't blame you, though. I want you

to know that. Even after all you've

done. I understand, Blade, I really

do. It's the human side of you which

has corrupted your reasoning, made you

weak. But we'll take care of that,

won't we?

BLADE

I'd kill myself -- before I turned

into something like you.

FROST

No you wouldn't. I'm going to bleed

you dry, Blade. All the poison that

makes you human.

(drawing closer)

When the Tide comes, you'll be begging

me put you through the Change.

FROST

It's done. We should ready ourselves

for the ritual of invocation.

VANESSA (O.S.)

There's no use fighting us, Jason.

BLADE

How could you be a part of this?

VANESSA

These are my people now. I'm one of

them.

BLADE

You don't have to be.

VANESSA

You don't understand. I've killed,

I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.

VANESSA

I wish you could see the world as I

do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no

turning back from that.

BLADE

I don't believe that.

VANESSA

You will. Time is on our side. Sooner

or later, the Thirst always wins.

BLADE

Mother!

VANESSA

Your mother died the night you

were born.

REVENANT (O.S.)

Karennnnn --

REVENANT

Karreennnnnn. I never thought I'd see

you againnnnn.

KAREN

Curtis?!

CURTIS REVENANT

Tell, me, Karennn -- ever have second

thoughts -- about us?

MERCURY

It won't be long now, lover.

QUINN

We should finish him off.

MERCURY

(shaking her head)

No. Deacon wants him turned.

QUINN

Fucking waste, if you ask me.

FROST

Tonight is the night we've waited our

entire lives for. Tonight, the

blood-dimmed Tide is loosed upon the

world. Tonight, the Age of Man comes

to an end.

KAREN

(whispering, urgent)

Blade.

FROST

(grinning, to himself)

"And what rough beast, its hour come

round at last, slouches towards

Bethlehem to be born?"

BLADE

Get out of here --

KAREN

I'm not leaving without you.

BLADE

You don't understand. The Thirst --

BLADE

(gasping)

-- tearing me -- apart.

KAREN

I know. Take some of my blood.

BLADE

No --

KAREN

It's the only way. You know that.

We'll never get out of here alive if

you don't.

BLADE

I can't -- I won't be able to stop --

KAREN

Yes you will. The human side of you is

stronger. I know it is.

BLADE

NO!!!!

KAREN

Don't stop --

KAREN

My God --

KAREN

(hesitant)

Are you -- all right?

BLADE

(near-demonic)

Never been better.

MERCURY

Deacon?

FROST

No longer.

BLADE (O.S.)

Frost!!!

BLADE

Who dies first?

FROST

(growling, to the others)

Take him.

QUINN

Grew another hand for you sweetmeat --

(tossing the dagger to his new hand)

-- and now I'm gonna kill you with it.

BLADE

Let's see if you can grow a new one

of these!

BLADE

Next?

MERCURY

Have a taste of your own medicine!

FROST (O.S.)

Enough!!!

FROST

You're too late, Blade. I'm already

changing. Don't you see? The Sleeper

has awakened. I'm not just Frost

anymore. I'm becoming a god now,

blood incarnate.

VANESSA

Did you think I'd forgotten you, you

little whore?

FROST

You can't hurt me anymore.

BLADE

Where are you?!

FROST

Everywhere.

FROST

You want my blood so much?! Take it!

FROST

I was wrong about you, Blade. You were

never one of us. You're a traitor to

your race.

KAREN (O.S.)

Get away from him!

KAREN

Blade!

BLADE

Guess you're not quite as invulnerable

as you thought.

FROST

You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and

my transition will be complete. Even

your sword won't be able to affect me

then.

BLADE

You don't have a few minutes, Frost.

FROST

(laughing cruelly)

Just as I thought. Still chained to

your mother's breast after all these

years.

FROST

(gloating)

You're too human, Blade.

BLADE

(steeling himself)

It's because I'm human that I can do

this.

KAREN (O.S.)

Blade?

KAREN

I never imagined I'd be so happy to

see the sun rise --

(turning to him)

It's over, isn't it?

BLADE

For them. But for me --

BLADE

I feel like it's finally beginning.
