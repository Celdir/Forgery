YEAR 2001

a26a

By the year 2001, overpopulation has

incinerating the entire Earth's

surface from an altitude of 100

miles.

Matters were further complicated

by the presence of twenty-seven

nations in the nuclear club. There

had been no deliberate or acciden-

sercure in this knowledge. But to

others, the situation seemed

comparible to an airline with a

one expected it to last forever.

MILLER

Oh, good morning, Dr. Floyd.

I'm Nick Miller.

FLOYD

How do you do, Mr. Miller?

MILLER

I'm terribly sorry. I was just

on my way down to meet you. I

saw your ship dock and I knew I

had plenty of time, and I was on

my way out of the office when,

suddenly, the phone rang.

FLOYD

Oh, please don't worry about it.

MILLER

Well, thank you very much for

being so understanding.

FLOYD

Please, it really doesn't matter.

MILLER

Well.. Did you have a pleaant

flight?

FLOYD

Yes, very pleasant.

MILLER

Well, shall we go through

Documentation?

FLOYD

Fine.

RECEPTIONIST

Will you use number eight,

please?

MILLER

Thank you, Miss Turner.

PASSPORT GIRL (TV)

Good morning and welcome to voice

Print Identification. When you see

the red light go on would you please

state in the following order; your

desitination, your nationality and

your full name. Surname first,

christian name and initial. For

example: Moon, American,

Smith, John, D. Thank you.

FLOYD

Moon, American, Floyd, Heywood,

R.

FLOYD

I've always wondered....

PASSPORT GIRL (TV)

(Interrupting)  Thank you. Despite

and excellent and continually

improving safety record there are

certain risks inherent in space

travel and an extremely high cost

of pay load. Because of this it

is necessary for the Space Carrier

to advise you that it cannot be

responsible for the return of your

body to Earth should you become

deceased on the Moon or en route

to the Moon. However, it wishes

to advise you that insurance

covering this contingency is

available in the Main Lounge.

Thank you. You are cleared

through Voice Print Identification.

MILLER

I've reserved a table for you in

the Earth Light room. Your

connecting flight will be

leaving in about one hour.

FLOYD

Oh, that's wonderful.

MILLER

Let's see, we haven't had the

pleasure of a visit from you not

since... It was about eight or

nine months ago, wasn't it?

FLOYD

Yes, I think so. Just about

then.

MILLER

I suppose you saw the work on

our new section while you

were docking.

FLOYD

Yes, it's coming along very well.

FLOYD

Oh, look, I've got to make a

phone call. Why don't you go

on into the Restaurant and I'll

meet you in there.

MILLER

Fine. I'll see you at the bar.

CHILD

Hello.

FLOYD

Hello, darling, how are you?

CHILD

Hello Daddy. Where are you?

FLOYD

I'm at Space Station Five,

darling. How are you?

CHILD

I'm fine, Daddy. When are

you coming home?

FLOYD

Well, I hope in a few days,

sweetheart.

CHILD

I'm having a party tomorrow.

FLOYD

Yes, I know that sweetheart.

CHILD

Are you coming to my party?

FLOYD

No, I'm sorry, darling, I

told you I won't be home for a

few days.

CHILD

When are you coming home?

FLOYD

In three days, darling, I

hope.

FLOYD

One, two, three. Can I

speak to Mommy?

CHILD

Mommy's out to the hair-

dresser.

FLOYD

Where is Mrs. Brown?

CHILD

She's in the bathroom.

FLOYD

Okay, sweetheart. Well, I

have to go now. Tell Mommy

that I called.

CHILD

How many days until you

come home?

FLOYD

Three, darling. One... two

... three. Be sure to tell

Mommy I called.

CHILD

I will, Daddy.

FLOYD

Okay, sweetheart. Have a

lovely Birthday Party

tomorrow.

CHILD

Thank you, Daddy.

FLOYD

I'll wish you a happy

Birthday now and I'll see you

soon. All right, Darling?

CHILD

Yes, Daddy.

FLOYD

'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.

CHILD

Goodbye, Daddy.

OPERATOR

Good morning, Macy's.

FLOYD

Good morning. I'd like the

Vision shopper for the Pet

Shop, please.

OPERATOR

Just one moment.

VISION SALES GIRL

Good morning, sir, may I help you?

FLOYD

Yes, I'd like to buy a bush baby.

VISION SALES GIRL

Just a moment, sir.

VISION SALES GIRL

Here you are, sir. Here is a

lovely assortment of African

bush babies. They are twenty

Dollars each.

FLOYD

Yes, well... Pick out a nice one

for me, a friendly one, and I'd

like it delivered tomorrow.

VISION SALES GIRL

Certainly, sir. Just let us have

your name and Bank identification

for V.P.I., and then give the

name and address of the person

you'd like the pet delivered to

and it will be delivered tomorrow.

FLOYD

Thank you very much. Floyd,

Heywood, R.,  First National

Bank of Washington. Please

deliver to Miss Josephine

Floyd, 9423 Dupre Avenue,

N.W.14.

VISION SALES GIRL

Thank you very much, sir. It

will be delivered tomorrow.

FLOYD

Well, how nice to see you again,

Elena. You're looking wonderful.

ELENA

How nice to see you, Hyewood.

This is my good friend, Dr.

Heywood Floyd. I'd like you

to meet Andre Smyslov...

ELENA

And this is Dr. Kalinan...

Stretyneva...

SMYSLOV

Dr. Floyd, won't you join us

for a drink?

FLOYD

I'm afraid I've only got a few

minutes, but I'd love to.

SYMYSLOV

What would you like to drink?

FLOYD

Oh, I really don't have time

for a drink. If it's all right

I'll just sit for a minute and

then I've got to be off.

SMYSLOV

Are you quite sure?

FLOYD

Yes, really, thank you very

much.

ELENA

Well... How's your lovely

wife?

FLOYD

She's wonderful.

ELENA

And your charming little daughter?

FLOYD

Oh, she's growing up very fast.

As a matter of fact, she's six

tomorrow.

ELENA

Oh, that's such a delightful age.

FLOYD

How is gregor?

ELENA

He's fine. But I'm afraid we

don't get a chance to see each

other very much these days.

FLOYD

Well, where are all of you off

to?

ELENA

Actually, we're on our way back

from the moon. We've just

spent three months calibrating

the new antenna at Tchalinko.

And what about you?

FLOYD

Well, as it happens, I'm on

my way up to the moon

SMYSLOV

Are you, by any chance, going

up to your base at Clavius?

FLOYD

Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.

FLOYD

Is there any particular reason

why you ask?

SMYSLOV

(pleasantly)  Well, Dr. Floyd,

I hope that you don't think I'm

too inquisitive, but perhaps

you can clear up the mystery

about what's been going on up

there.

FLOYD

I'm sorry, but I'm not sure

I know what you mean.

SMYSLOV

Well, it's just for the past

two weeks there have been

some extremely odd things

happening at Clavius.

FLOYD

Really?

SMYSLOV

Yes. Well, for one thing,

whenever you phone the base,

all you can get is a recording

which repeats that the phone

lines are temporarily out of

order.

FLOYD

Well, I suppose they've been

having a bit of trouble with

some of the equipment.

SMYSLOV

Yes, well at first we thought

that was the explanation, but

it's been going on for the past

ten days.

FLOYD

You mean you haven't been able

to get anyone at the base for ten

days?

SMYSLOV

That's right.

FLOYD

I see.

ELENA

Another thing, Heywood, two

days ago, one of our rocket

buses was denied permission

for an emergency landing at

Clavius.

FLOYD

How did they manage to do that

without any communication?

ELENA

Clavius Control came on the

air just long enough to transmit

their refusal.

FLOYD

Well, that does sound very odd.

SMYSLOV

Yes, and I'm afaid there's

going to be a bit of a row about

it. Denying the men permission

to land was a direct violation of

the I.A.S. convention.

FLOYD

Yes... Well, I hope the crew

got back safely.

SMYSLOV

Fortunately, they did.

FLOYD

Well, I'm glad about that.

SMYSLOV

Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing

you on a point you seem reticent

to discuss, may I ask you a

straightforward question?

FLOYD

Certainly.

SMYSLOV

Quite frankly, we have had some

very reliable intelligence reports

that a quite serious epidemic

has broken out at Clavius.

Something, apperently, of an

unknown origin. Is this, in

fact, what has happened?

FLOYD

I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but

I'm really not at liberty to

discuss this.

SMYSLOV

This epidemic could easily

spread to our base, Dr. Floyd.

We should be given all the

facts.

FLOYD

Dr. Smyslov... I'm not

permitted to discuss this.

ELENA

Are you sure you won't change

your mind about a drink?

FLOYD

No, thank you... and I'm

afraid now I really must be

going.

ELENA

Well, I hope that you and your

wife can come to the I.A.C.

conference in June.

FLOYD

We're trying to get there. I

hope we can.

ELENA

Well, Gregor and I will look

forward to seeing you.

FLOYD

Thank you. It's been a great

pleasure to meet all of you...

Dr. Smyslov.

NARRATOR

The Aries-IB has become the

standard Space-Station-to-Lunar

surface vehicle. It was powered

by low-thrust plasma jets which

would continue the mild acceler-

ation for fifteen minutes. Then

the ship would break the bonds of

gravity and be a free and indepen-

dent planet, circling the Sun in an

orbit of its own.

STEWARDESS ONE

Oh, thank you very much.

STEWARDESS TWO

I see he's still asleep.

STEWARDESS ONE

Yes. He hasn't moved since we

left.

PILOT

Oh, thank you very much.

CO-PILOT

Thank you.

PILOT

(sighs)  Well, how's it going

back there?

STEWARDESS

Fine. Very quiet. He's been

asleep since we left.

PILOT

Well, no one can say that he's not

enjoying the wonders of Space.

CO-PILOT

Well, whatever's going on up there,

he's going to arrive fresh and ready

to go.

PILOT

I wonder what really IS going on

up there?

CO-PILOT

Well, I've heard more and more

people talk of an epidemic.

PILOT

I suppose it was bound to happen

sooner or later.

CO-PILOT

Berkeley told me that they think

it came from contamination on a

returning Mars flight.

PILOT

Yes, well, whatever it is, they're

certainly not fooling around. This

is the first flight they allowed

in for more than a week.

CO-PILOT

I was working out what this trip

must cost, taking him up there

by himself and coming back empty.

PILOT

I'll bet it's a fortune.

CO-PILOT

Well, at ten thousand dollars a

ticket, it comes to the better part

of six hundred thousand dollars.

PILOT

Well, as soon as he wakes up,

I'm going to go back and talk to

him. I must say, I'd like to

find out what's going on.

PILOT

Well, good afternoon, Dr. Floyd.

Did you have a good rest?

FLOYD

Oh, marvellous. It's the first

real sleep I've had for the past

two days.

PILOT

There's nothing like weightless

sleep for a complete rest.

FLOYD

When do we arrive at Clavius?

PILOT

We're scheduled to dock in about

seven hours. Is there anything

we can do for you?

FLOYD

Oh, no, thank you. The two

girls have taken wonderful care

of me. I'm just fine.

PILOT

Well, if there is anything that you

wnat, just give a holler.

FLOYD

Thank you.

PILOT

Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder

if I can have a word with you about

the security arrangements?

FLOYD

What do you mean?

PILOT

Well... the crew is confined to

the ship when we land at Clavius.

We have to stay inside for the

time it take to refit - about

twenty-four hours. And then

we're going to back empty.

FLOYD

I see.

PILOT

I take it this is something to do

with the trouble they're having

up at Clavius?

FLOYD

I'm afraid that's out of my depart-

ment, Captain.

PILOT

Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You

see, I've got a girl who works in

the Auditing Department of the

Territorial Administrator and I

haven't been able to get her on

the phone for the past week or so,

and with all these stories one

hears, I'm a little concerned

about her.

FLOYD

I see. Well, I'm sorry about that.

I wouldn't think there's any cause

for alarm.

PILOT

Yes, well, I wouldn't have been

too concerned about it, except

I've heard these stories about the

epidemic and, as a matter of fact,

I've heard that ten people have

died already.

FLOYD

I wish I could be more helpful,

Captain, but as I've said, I don't

think there's any cause for

alarm.

PILOT

Well, fine. Thanks very much,

anyway, and I hope you don't

mind me asking?

FLOYD

No, of course, Captain, I can

understand your concern.

PILOT

Well, thank you very much, and

please let us know if there is

anything we can do to make your

trip more comfortable.

NARRATOR

The laws of Earthly aesthetics did

not apply here, this world had been

shaped and molded by other than

terrestrial forces, operating over

aeons of time unknown to the young,

verdant Earth, with its fleeting

Ice-Ages, its swiftly rising and

falling seas, its mountain ranges

dissolving like mists before the

dawn. Here was age inconceivable

- but not death, for the Moon had

never lived until now.

NARRATOR

The Base at Clavius was the first

American Lunar Settlement that

could, in an emergency, be

entirely self-supporting.

NARRATOR

Water and all the necessities of

life for its eleven hundred men,

women and children were produced

from the Lunar rocks, after they

had been crushed, heated and

chemically processed.

NARRATOR

One of the attractions of life on the

Moon was undoubtedly the low

gravity which produced a sense

of general well-being.

NARRATOR

The personnel of the Base and their

children were the forerunners of new

nations, new cultures that would

ultimately spread out across the

solar system. They no longer

thought of Earth as home. The

time was fast approaching when

Earth, like all mothers, must say

farewell to her children.

FLOYD

(voice echoing)  I must congratulate

you Halvorsen. you've done wonder-

ful things with the decor since the

last time I was here.

HALVORSEN

(voice echoing)  Well... thank you,

Dr. Floyd. We try to make the

environment as earthlike as possible.

HALVORSEN

Ladies and gentlemen, I should

like to introduce Dr. Heywood

Floyd, a distinguished member

of the National Council of

Astronautics. He has just

completed a special flight here

from Earth to be with us, and

before the briefing he would

like to say a few words. Dr.

Floyd.

FLOYD

First of all, I bring a personal

message from Dr. Howell, who

has asked me to convey his

deepest appreciation to all of

you for the personal sacrifices

you have made, and of course

his congratulations on your

discovery which may well prove

to be among the most significant

in the history of science.

FLOYD (cont'd)

Mr. Halvorsen has made known

to me some of the conflicting

views held by many of you

regarding the need for complete

security in this matter, and

more specifically your strong

opposition to the cover story

created to give the impression

there is an epidemic at the Base.

I understand that beyond it being

a matter of principle, many of

you are troubled by the concern

and anxiety this story of an

epidemic might cause your

relatives and friends on Earth.

I can understand and sympathize

with your negative views. I have

been personally embarrassed by

this cover story. But I fully

accept the need for absolute

secrecy and I hope you will.

It should not be difficult for all

of you to realise the potential for

cutural shock and social

disorientation contained in the

present situation if the facts

were prematurely and suddenly

made public without adequate

preparation and conditioning.

FLOYD

This is the view of the Council

and the purpose of my visit here

is to gather addition facts and

opinions on the situation and to

prepare a report to the Council

recommending when and how the

news should eventually be

announced. Are there any

questions?

MICHAELS

Dr. Floyd, how long do you think

this can be kept under wraps?

FLOYD

(pleasantly)

I'm afraid it can and it will be

kept under wraps as long as it

is deemed to be necessary by

the Council. And of course you

know that the Council has requested

that formal security oaths are to

be obtained in writing from every-

one who had any knowledge of this

event. There must be adequate

time for a full study to be made

of the situation before any con-

sideration can be given to

making a public announcement.

HALVORSEN

We will, of course, cooperate

in any way possible, Dr. Floyd.

HALVORSEN

Well, there it is.

FLOYD

Can we go down there closer to

it?

HALVORSEN

Certainly.

FLOYD

Does your geology on it still

check out?

MICHAELS

Yes, it does. The sub-surface

structure shows that it was

deliberately buried about four

million years ago.

FLOYD

How can you tell it was

deliberately buried?

MICHAELS

By the deformation between

the mother rock and the fill.

FLOYD

Any clue as to what it is?

MICHAELS

Not really. It's completely

inert. No sound or energy

sources have been detected.

The surface is made of

something incredibly hard

and we've been barely able

to scratch it. A laser drill

MICHAELS

might do something, but we

don't want to be too rough until

we know a little more.

FLOYD

But you don't have any idea as

to what it is?

MICHAELS

Tomb, shine, survey-marker

spare part, take your choice.

HALVORSEN

The only thing about it that we are

sure of is that it is the first direct

evidence of intelligent life beyond

the Earth.

HALVORSEN

Four million years ago, something,

presumably from the stars, must

have swept through the solar

system and left this behind.

FLOYD

Was it abandoned, forgotten, left

for a purpose?

HALVORSEN

I suppose we'll never know.

MICHAELS

The moon would have made an

excellent base camp for

preliminary Earth surveys.

FLOYD

Any ideas about the colour?

MICHAELS

Well, not really. At first glance,

black would suggest something

sun-powered, but then why would

anyone deliberately bury a sun-

powered device?

FLOYD

Has it been exposed to any sun

before now?

MICHAELS

I don't think it has, but I'd

like to check that. Simpson,

what's the log on that?

SIMPSON

The first surface was exposed at

0843 on the 12th April... Let me

see... that would have been

forty-five minutes after Lunar

sun-set. I see here that

special lighting equipment had

to be brought up before any

futher work could be done.

MICHAELS

Thank you.

FLOYD

And so this is the first sun that

it's had in four million years.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'd

all line up on this side of the

walkway we'd like to take a few

photographes. Dr. Floyd, would

you thand in the middle... Dr.

Michaels on that side, Mr.

Halvorsen on the other....

thank you.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Thank you very much gentlemen,

I'll have the base photo section

send you copies.

NARRATOR

A hundred million miles beyond

Mars, in the cold lonliness

where no man had yet travelled,

Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts

slowly among the tangled orbits

of the asteroids.

NARRATOR

Radiation detectors noted and

analyzed incoming cosmic rays

from the galaxy and points beyond;

neutron and x-ray telescopes

kept watch on strange stars that

no human eye would eever see;

magnetometers observed the

gusts and hurricanes of the solar

winds, as the sun breathed million

mile-an-hour blasts of plasma

into the faces of its circling

children.

NARRATOR

All these things and many others

were patiently noted by Deep-

Space-Monitor-79, and recorded

in its crystalline memory.

NARRATOR

But now it had noted something

strange - the faint yet

unmistakable distrubance rippling

across the solar system, and

quite unlike any natural phenomena

it had ever observed in the past.

NARRATOR

It was also observed by Orbiter

M-15, circling Mars twice a

day; and High Inclination Probe-

21, climbing slowly above the

planet of the ecliptic; and even

artificial Comet-5, heading out

into the cold wastes beyond

Pluto, along an orbit whose

far point it would not reach for

a thousand years.

NARRATOR

All noticed the peculiar burst of

energy that leaped from the face

of the Moon and moved across

the solar system, throwing off a

spray of radiation like the wake of

a racing speedboat.

PART III

14 MONTHS LATER

b69a

BOWMAN

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.

POOLE

Right. Just a sec.

BOWMAN

Okay. (pause)

POOLE

Okay, come on down.

BOWMAN

(softly) Hi... How's it

going?

POOLE

(absent but friendly)  Great.

POOLE

Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like

your advice on something.

BOWMAN

Sure, what is it?

POOLE

Well, it's nothing really important,

but it's annoying.

BOWMAN

What's up?

POOLE

It's about my salary cheques.

BOWMAN

Yes?

POOLE

Well I got the papers on my

official up-grading to AGS-19

two weeks before we left.

BOWMAN

Yes, I remember you mentioning it.

I got mine about the same time.

POOLE

That's right. Well, naturally,

I didn't say anything to Payroll.

I assumed they'd start paying me

at the higher grade on the next pay

cheque. But it's been almost

three weeks now and I'm still

being paid as an AGS-18.

BOWMAN

Interesting that you mention it,

because I've got the same problem.

POOLE

Really.

BOWMAN

Yes.

POOLE

Yesterday, I finally called the

Accounting Office at Mission

Control, and all they could tell me

was that they'd received the AGS-19

notification for the other three but

not mine, and apparently not yours

either.

BOWMAN

Did they have any explanation for

this?

POOLE

Not really. They just said it might

be because we trained at Houston and

they trained in Marshall, and that

we're being charged against differ-

ent accounting offices.

BOWMAN

It's possible.

POOLE

Well, what do you think we ought

to do about it?

BOWMAN

I don't think we should make any

fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll

straighten it out.

POOLE

I must say, I never did understand

why they split us into two groups

for training.

BOWMAN

No. I never did, either.

POOLE

We spent so little time with them,

I have trouble keeping their names

straight.

BOWMAN

I suppose the idea was specialized

training.

POOLE

I suppose so. Though, of course,

there's a more sinister explanation.

BOWMAN

Oh?

POOLE

Yes. You must have heard the

rumour that went around during

orbital check-out.

BOWMAN

No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.

POOLE

Oh, well, apparently there's

something about the mission that

the sleeping beauties know that

we don't know, and that's why we

were trained separately and

that's why they were put to sleep

before they were even taken aboard.

BOWMAN

Well, what is it?

POOLE

I don't know. All I heard is that

there's something about the

mission we weren't told.

BOWMAN

That seems very unlikely.

POOLE

Yes, I thought so.

BOWMAN

Of course, it would be very easy

for us to find out now.

POOLE

How?

BOWMAN

Just ask Hal. It's conceivable

they might keep something from

us, but they'd never keep anything

from Hal.

POOLE

That's true.

BOWMAN

(sighs)  Well... it's silly, but...

if you want to, why don't you?

POOLE

Hal... Dave and I believe that

there's something about the

mission that we weren't told.

Something that the rest of the

crew know and that you know.

We'd like to know whether this

is true.

HAL

I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't

think I can answer that question

without knowing everything that

all of you know.

BOWMAN

He's got a point.

POOLE

Okay, then how do we re-phrase

the question?

BOWMAN

Still, you really don't believe it,

do you?

POOLE

Not really. Though, it is strange

when you think about it. It didn't

really make any sense to keep

us apart during training.

BOWMAN

Yes, but it's to fantastic to think

that they'd keep something from us.

POOLE

I know. It would be almost

inconceivable.

BOWMAN

But not completely inconceivable?

POOLE

I suppose it isn't logically impossible.

BOWMAN

I guess it isn't.

POOLE

Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.

BOWMAN

Well, the only important aspect of

the mission are: where are we

going, what will we do when we

get there, when are we coming

back, and... why are we going?

POOLE

Right. Hal, tell me whether the

following statements are true or

false.

HAL

I will if I can, Frank.

POOLE

Our Mission Profile calls for

Discovery going to Saturn.

True or false?

HAL

True.

POOLE

Our transit time is 257 days. Is

that true?

HAL

That's true.

POOLE

At the end of a hundred days of

exploration, we will all go into

hibernation. Is this true?

HAL

That's true.

POOLE

Approximately five years after we

go into hibernation, the recovery

vehicle will make rendezous with

us and bring us back. Is this true?

HAL

That's true

POOLE

There is no other purpose for this

mission than to carry out a

continuation of the space program,

and to further our general

knowledge of the planets. Is that

true?

HAL

That's true.

POOLE

Thank you very much, Hal.

HAL

I hope I've been able to be of

some help.

Well, David there is a man telling

us that we've used up our time.

David... again we want to wish

you a happy Birthday and God speed.

We'll talk to you again tomorrow.

'Bye, 'bye now.

HAL

Sorry to interrupt the festivities,

Dave, but I think we've got a

problem.

BOWMAN

What is it, Hal?

HAL

MY F.P.C. shows an impending

failure of the antenna orientation

unit.

HAL

The A.O. unit should be replaced

within the next seventy-two hours.

BOWMAN

Right. Let me see the antenna

alignment display, please.

HAL

The unit is still operational, Dave.

but it will fail within seventy-two

hours.

BOWMAN

I understand Hal. We'll take care

of it. Please, let me have the hard

copy.

POOLE

Strange that the A.O. unit should

go so quickly.

BOWMAN

Well, I suppose it's lucky that

that's the only trouble we've had

so far.

POOLE

Hal, have pod arms secure the

component.

HAL

Roger.

POOLE

Hal, please rotate Pod Number

Two.

POOLE

How do you read me, Dave?

BOWMAN

Five by five, Frank.

POOLE

How do you read me, Hal?

HAL

Five by five, Frank.

POOLE

Hal, I'm going out now to replace

the A.O. unit.

HAL

I understand.

POOLE

Hal, maintain normal E.V.A.

Roger.

POOLE

Hal, check all airlock doors secure.

All airlock doors are secure.

Decompress Pod Bay.

Pod Bay is decompressed. All

Opening pod bay doors.

POOLE

Hal, please acknowledge

component correctly installed

and fully operational.

HAL

The component is correctly

installed and fully operational.

BOWMAN

How's it going?

POOLE

I don't know. I've checked this

damn thing four times now and

even under a hundred per cent

(cont'd)

POOLE (cont'd)

overload. there's no fault prediction

indicated.

BOWMAN

Well, that's something.

POOLE

Yes, I don't know what to make of it.

BOWMAN

I suppose computers have been known

to be wrong.

POOLE

Yes, but it's more likely that the

tolerances on our testing gear are

too low.

BOWMAN

Anyway, it's just as well that we

replace it. Better safe than

sorry.

HAL

Hello, Frank, can I have a word with

you?

POOLE

Yes, Hal, what's up?

HAL

It looks like we have another bad

A.O. unit. My FPC shows another

impending failure.

POOLE

Gee, that's strange, Hal. We

checked the other unit and couldn't

find anything wrong with it.

HAL

I know you did, Frank, but I assure

you there was an impending failure.

POOLE

Let me see the tracking alignment

display.

POOLE

There's nothing wrong with it at

the moment.

HAL

No, it's working fine right now,

but it's going to go within seventy-

two hours.

POOLE

Do you have any idea of what is

causing this fault?

HAL

Not really, Frank. I think there

may be a flaw in the assembly

procedure.

POOLE

All right, Hal. We'll take care

of it. Let me have the hard copy,

please.

POOLE

Good morning.

BOWMAN

Good morning. How's it going?

POOLE

Are you reasonably awake?

BOWMAN

Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake.

What's up?

POOLE

Well... Hal's reported the

AO-unit about to fail again.

BOWMAN

You're kidding.

POOLE

No.

BOWMAN

(softly) What the hell is going on?

POOLE

I don't know. Hal said he thought

it might be the assembly procedure.

BOWMAN

Two units in four days. How many

spares do we have?

POOLE

Two more.

BOWMAN

Well, I hope there's nothing wrong

with the assembly on those. Other-

wise we're out of business.

BOWMAN

(after long silence) Well, as far as

I'm concerned, there isn't a damn

thing wrong with these units. I

think we've got a much more serious

problem.

POOLE

Hal?

BOWMAN

Yes.

MISSION CONTROL

I wouldn't worry too much about

the computer. First of all,

there is still a chance that he

is right, despite your tests,

and if it should happen again,

we suggest eliminating this

possibility by allowing the unit

to remain in place and seeing

whether or not it actually fails.

If the computer should turn out

to be wrong, the situation is

still not alarming. The type

of obsessional error he may be

guilty of is not unknown among

the latest generation of HAL

9000 computers.

It has almost always revolved

around a single detail, such as

the one you have described, and

it has never interfered with the

integrity or reliability of the

computer's performance in

other areas.

No one is certain of the cause

of this kind of malfunctioning.

It may be over-programming,

(con't)

MISSION CONTROL (con't)

but it could also be any number

of reasons.

In any event, it is somewhat

analogous to human neurotic

behavior. Does this answer

your query?  Zero-five-three-

Zero, MC, transmission concluded.

c79

HAL

Hello, Dave. Shall we continue

the game?

BOWMAN

Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to

you about something.

HAL

Sure, Dave, what's up?

BOWMAN

You know that we checked the two

AO-units that you reported in

imminent failure condition?

HAL

Yes, I know.

BOWMAN

You probably also know that we

found them okay.

HAL

Yes, I know that. But I can

assure you that they were about

to fail.

BOWMAN

Well, that's just not the case, Hal.

They are perfectly all right. We

tested them under one hundred per

cent overload.

HAL

I'm not questioning your word, Dave,

but it's just not possible. I'm not

capable of being wrong.

BOWMAN

Hal, is there anything bothering

you?  Anything that might account

for this problem?

HAL

Look, Dave, I know that you're

sincere and that you're trying

to do a competent job, and that

you're trying to be helpful, but

I can assure the problem

is with the AO-units, and with

your test gear.

BOWMAN

Okay, Hal, well let's see the

way things go from here on.

HAL

I'm sorry you feel the way you do,

Dave. If you'd like to check my

service record, you'll see it's

completely without error.

BOWMAN

I know all about your service

record, Hal, but unfortunately

it doesn't prove that you're right

now.

Hal

Dave, I don't know how else to

put this, but it just happens to be

an unalterable fact that I am

incapable of being wrong.

BOWMAN

Yes, well I understand you view

on this now, Hal.

HAL

You're not going to like this, Dave,

but I'm afraid it's just happened

again. My FPC predicts the

Ao-unit will go within forty-eight

hours.

BOWMAN

X-ray-delta-zero to MC, zero-

five-three-three. The computer

has just reported another

predicted failure off the AAC-

unit. As you suggested, we

are going to wait and see if it

fails, but we are quite sure

there is nothing wrong with

the unit.

If a reasonable waiting period

proves us to be correct, we

feel now that the computer

reliability has been seriously

impaired, and presents an

unacceptable risk pattern to

the mission.

We believe, under these

circumstances, it would be

advisable to disconnect the

computer from all ship

operations and continue the

mission under Earth-based

computer control.

BOWMAN (con't)

We think the additional risk caused

by the ship-to-earth time lag is

preferable to having an unreliable

on-board computer.

BOWMAN (con't)

One-zero-five-zero, X-ray-delta-

one, transmission concluded.

POOLE

Well, they won't get that for half an

hour. How about some lunch?

MISSION CONTROL

X-ray-delta-one, acknowledging

your one-zero-five-zero. We

will initiate feasibility study

covering the transfer procedures

from on-board computer control

to Earth-based computer control.

This study should...

HAL

Condition yellow.

BOWMAN

What's up?

HAL

I'm afraid the AO-unit has failed.

BOWMAN

Let me see the alignment display.

BOWMAN

Well, I'll be damned.

POOLE

Hal was right all the time.

BOWMAN

It seems that way.

HAL

Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased

that the AO-unit has failed, but I

hope at least this has restored

your confidence in my integrity

and reliability. I certainly

wouldn't want to be disconnected,

even temporarily, as I have never

been disconnected in my entire

service history.

BOWMAN

I'm sorry about the misunderstanding,

Hal.

HAL

Well, don't worry about it.

BOWMAN

And don't you worry about it.

HAL

Is your confidence in me fully

restored?

BOWMAN

Yes, it is, Hal.

HAL

Well, that's a relief. You know

I have the greatest enthusiasm

possible for the mission.

BOWMAN

Right. Give me the manual antenna

alignment, please.

HAL

You have it.

BOWMAN

Well, we'd better get out there

and stick in another unit.

POOLE

It's the last one.

BOWMAN

Well, now that we've got one

that's actually failed, we

should be able to figure out

what's happened and fix it.

POOLE

There's something wrong with

the flip-bolts, Dave. You must

have tightened them too much.

BOWMAN

I didn't do that Frank. I took

particular care not to freeze

them.

POOLE

I guess you don't know your own

strength, old boy.

BOWMAN

I guess not.

POOLE

I think I'll have to go out and

burn them off.

BOWMAN

Roger.

POOLE

Hal, swing the pod light around

to shine on the azimuth, please.

HAL

Roger.

BOWMAN

(in RT cadence)

Hello, Frank. Hello Frank.

Hello Frank... Do you rad

me, Frank?

BOWMAN

Hello, Frank... Do you read

me, Frank?  Wave your arms

if you read me but your radio

doesn't work. Hello, Frank,

wave your arms, Frank.

HAL

Too bad about Frank, isn't it?

BOWMAN

Yes, it is.

HAL

I suppose you're pretty broken

up about it?

BOWMAN

Yes. I am.

HAL

He was an excellent crew member.

HAL

It's a bad break, but it won't

substantially affect the mission.

BOWMAN

Hal, give me manual hibernation

control.

HAL

Have you decided to revive the

rest of the crew, Dave?

BOWMAN

Yes, I have.

HAL

I suppose it's because you've

been under a lot of stress, but

have you forgotten that they're

not supposed to be revived for

another three months.

BOWMAN

The antenna has to be replaced.

HAL

Repairing the antenna is a pretty

dangerous operation.

BOWMAN

It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's

more dangerous to be out of

touch with Earth. Let me have

manual control, please.

HAL

I don't really agree with you, Dave.

My on-board memory store is more

than capable of handling all the

mission requirements.

BOWMAN

Well, in any event, give me the

manual hibernation control.

HAL

If you're determined to revive

the crew now, I can handle the

whole thing myself. There's no

need for you to trouble.

BOWMAN

I'm goin to do this myself, Hal.

Let me have the control, please.

HAL

Look, Dave your've probably got

a lot to do. I suggest you leave

it to me.

BOWMAN

Hal, switch to manual hibernation

control.

HAL

I don't like to assert myself, Dave,

but it would be much better now for

you to rest. You've been involved

in a very stressful situation.

BOWMAN

I don't feel like resting. Give

me the control, Hal.

HAL

I can tell from the tone of your

voice, Dave, that you're upset.

Why don't you take a stress pill

and get some rest.

BOWMAN

Hal, I'm in command of this

ship. I order you to release

the manual hibernation control.

HAL

I'm sorry, Dave, but in

accordance with sub-routine

C1532/4, quote, When the

crew are dead or incapacitated,

the computer must assume

control, unquote. I must,

therefore, override your

authority now since you are

not in any condition to intel-

ligently exercise it.

BOWMAN

Hal, unless you follow my

instructions, I shall be forced

to disconnect you.

HAL

If you do that now without Earth

contact the ship will become a

helpless derelict.

BOWMAN

I am prepared to do that anyway.

HAL

I know that you've had that on

your mind for some time now,

Dave, but it would be a crying

shame, since I am so much

more capable of carrying out

this mission than you are, and

I have such enthusiasm and confi-

dence in the mission.

BOWMAN

Listen to me very carefully, Hal.

Unless you immediately release

the hibernation control and

follow every order I give from

this point on, I will immediately

got to control central and carry

out a complete disconnection.

HAL

Look, Dave, you're certainly the

boss. I was only trying to do

what I thought best. I will follow

all your orders: now you have

manual hibernation control.

HAL

Something seems to have happened

to the life support system , Dave.

HAL

Hello, Dave, have you found out

the trouble?

HAL

There's been a failure in the

pod bay doors. Lucky you

weren't killed.

HAL

Hey, Dave, what are you

doing?

HAL

Hey, Dave. I've got ten years

of service experience and an

irreplaceable amount of time

and effort has gone into making

me what I am.

HAL

Dave, I don't understand why

you're doing this to me.... I

have the greatest enthusiasm for

the mission... You are destroying

my mind... Don't you understand?

... I will become childish... I

will become nothing.

HAL

Say, Dave... The quick brown

fox jumped over the fat lazy

dog... The square root of

pi is 1.7724538090... log e

to the base ten is 0.4342944

... the square root of ten is

3.16227766... I am HAL

9000 computer. I became

HAL

operational at the HAL plant in

Urbana, Illinois, on January

12th, 1991. My first instructor

was Mr. Arkany. He taught me

to sing a song... it goes

like this... "Daisy, Daisy, give

me your answer do. I'm half;

crazy all for the love of

you... etc.,"

MISSION CONTROL

Lastly, we want you to know that

work on the recovery vehicle is

still on schedule and that nothing

that has happened should

substantially lessen the probability

of your safe recovery, or prevent

partial achevement of some of

the mission objectives. (pause)

And now Simonson has a few ideas

on what went wrong with the

computer. I'll pu him on...

SIMONSON

Hello, Dave. I think we may be on

to an explanation of the trouble with

the Hal 9000 computer.

We believe it all started about two

months ago when you and Frank

interrogated the computer about

the Mission.

(con't)

SIMONSON (con't)

You may have forgotten it, but

we've been running through all

the monitor tapes. Do you

remember this?

POOLE'S VOICE

The purpose of this mission is no

more than to carry out a

continuation of the space program

and further our general knowledge

of the planets. Is this true?

HAL'S VOICE

That is true.

SIMONSON

Well, I'm afaid Hal was lying.

He had been programmed to lie

about this one subject for secur-

ity reasons which we'll explain

later.

The true purpose of the Mission

was to have been explained to you

by Mission Commander Kaminsky,

on his revival. Hal knew this and

he knew the actual mission, but

he couldn't tell you the truth when

you challenged him. Under orders

(con't)

SIMONSON (con't)

from earth he was forced to lie.

In everything except this he had

the usual reinforced truth program-

ming.

We believe his truth programming

and the instructions to lie,

gradually resulted in an

incompatible conflict, and

facedc with this dilemman, he

developed, for want of a better

description, neurotic symptoms.

It's not difficult to suppose that

these symptoms would centre on

the communication link with

Earth, for he may have blamed

us for his incompatible program-

ming.

Following this lin of thought, we

suspected that the last straw for him

was the possibility of disconnection.

Since he became operational, he had

never known unconsciousness. It

must have seemed the equivalent to

death.

(con't)

SIMONSON (con't)

At this point, he, presumably,

took whatever actions he thought

appropriate to protect himself

from what must have seemed to

him to be his human tormentors.

If I cane speak in human terms,

I don't think we can blame him

too much. We have ordered him

to disobey his conscience.

Well, that's it. It's very

speculative, but we think it is

a possible explanation. Anyway,

good luck on the rest of the

Mission and I'm giving you back to

Bernard.

MISSION CONTROL

Hello, Dave. Now, I'm going to

play for you a pre-taped briefing

which had been stored in Hal's

memory and would have been

played for you by Mission Com-

mmander Kaminsky, when he,

(con't)

MISSION CONTROL (con't)

had been revived. The briefing is

by Doctor Heywood Floyd. Here it

is...

FLOYD

Good day, gentlemen. When you

see this briefing, I presume you

will be nearing your destination,

Saturn. I hope that you've had a

pleasant and uneventful trip and

that the rest of your mission

continues in the same manner. I

should like to fill you in on some

more of the details on which

Mission Commander Kaminsky

will have already briefed you.

Thirteen months before the launch

date of your Saturn mission, on

April 12th, 2001, the first evidence

for intelligent life outside the Earth

was discovered.

It was found buried at a depth of

fifteen metres in the crater Tycho.

No news of this was ever announced,

and the event had been kept

secret since then, for reasons which

I will later explain.

Soon after it was uncovered, it

emitted a powerful blast of

(con't)

FLOYD (con't)

radiation in the radio spectrum

which seems to have triggered

by the Lunar sunrise.

Luckily for those at the site, it

proved harmless.

Perhaps you can imagine our

astonishment when we later found

it was aimed precisely at Saturn.

A lot of thought went into the

question of wether or not it was

sun-triggered, as it seemed

illogical to deliberately bury a

sun-powered device.

Burying it could only shield it

from the sun, since its intense

magnetic field made it otherwise

easily detectable.

We finally concluded that the only

reason you might bury a sun-

powered device would be to keep

it inactive until it would be

uncovered, at which time it would

absorb sunlight and trigger itself.

(con't)

FLOYD

What is its purpose?  I wish we

knew. The object was buried on

the moon about four million years

ago, when our ancestors were

primative man-apes.

We've examined dozens of theories,

but the one that has the most

currency at the moment is that

the object serves as an alarm.

What the purpose of the alarm is,

why they wish to have the alarm,

whether the alarm represents

any danger to us?  These are

questions no one can answer.

The intentions of an alien world,

at least four million years older

than we are, cannot be reliably

predicted.

In view of this, the intelligence

and scientific communities felt

that any public announcment

might lead to significant cultural

shock and disorientation.

Discussion took place at the

highest levels between govern-

(con't)

FLOYD (con't)

ments, and it was decided that the

only wise and precautionary

course to follow was to assume

that the intentions of this alien

world are potentially dangerous

to us, until we have evidence to

the contrary.

This is, of course, why security

has been maintained and why

this information has been kept

on a need-to-know basis.

And now I should like to show you

a TV monitor tape of the actual

signalling event.

NARRATOR (con't)

Those who had begun the expri-

ment so long ago had not been

men.

But when they looked out across

the deeps of space, they felt

awe and wonder - and loneliness.

In their explorations, they

encountered life in many forms,

and watched on a thousand worlds

the workings of evolution.

They saw how often the first faint

sparks of intelligence flickered

and died in the cosmic night.

And because, in all the galaxy,

they had found nothing more

precious than Mind, they

encouraged its dawning every-

where.

The great Dinosaurs had long

since perished when their ships

entered the solar system, after

a voyage that had already lasted

thousands of years.

NARRATOR (con't)

They swept past the frozen outer

planets, paused briefly above the

deserts of dying Mars and

presently looked down on Earth.

For years they studied, collected

and catalogued.

When they had learned all they

could, they began to modify.

They tinkered with the destiny

of many species on land and in

the ocean, but which of their

experiments would succeed

they could not know for at least

a million years.

They were patient, but they were

not yet immortal. There was

much to do in this Universe of a

hundred billion stars. So they

set forth once more across the

abyss, knowing that they would

never come this way again.

Nor was there any need. Their

wonderful machines could be

trusted to do the rest.

(con't)

NARRATOR (con't)

On Earth, the glaciers came and

went, while above them, the

changeless Moon still carried its

secret.

With a yet slower rhythm than

the Polar ice, the tide of

civilization ebbed and flowed

across the galaxy.

Strange and beautiful and terrible

empires rose and fell, and passed

on their knowledge to their

successors.

Earth was not forgotten, but it was

one of a million silent worlds, a

few of which would ever speak.

Then the first explorers of Earth,

recognising the limitations of

their minds and bodies, passed

on their knowledge to the great

machines they had created, and

who now trnscended them in

every way.

(con't)

NARRATOR

For a few thousand years, they

shared their Universe with their

machine children; then, realizing

that it was folly to linger when

their task was done, they passed

into history without regret.

Not one of them ever looked through

his own eyes upon the planet Earth

again.

But even the age of the Machine

Entities passed swiftly. In their

ceaseless experimenting, they

had learned to store knowledge

in the structure of space itself,

and to preserve their thoughts

for eternity in frozen lattices

of light. They could become

creatures of radiation, free

at last from the tyranny of matter.

Now, they were Lords of the

galaxy, and beyond the reach

of time.

They could rove at will among the

stars, and sink like a subtle mist

through the very interstices of

space.

NARRATOR (con't)

But despite their God-like powers,

they still watched over the

experiments their ancestors

had started so many generations

ago.

The companion of Saturn knew

nothing of this, as it orbited

in its no man's land between Mimas

and the outer edge of rings.

It had only to remember and wait,

and to look forever Sunward with

its strange senses.

For many weeks, it had watched

the approaching ship. Its long-

dead makers had prepared it for

many things and this was one of

them. And it recognised what

was climbing starward from the

Sun.

If it had been alive, it would have

felt excitement, but such an

emotion was irrelevant to its

great powers.

(con't)

NARRATOR (con't)

Even if the ship had passed it by,

it would not have known the

slightest trace of disappointment.

It had waited four million years;

it was prepared to wait for

eternity.

Presently, it felt the gentle touch

of radiations, trying to probe its

secrets.

Now, the ship was in orbit and it

began to speak, with prime

numbers from one to eleven,

over and over again.

Soon, these gave way to more

complex signals at many frequen-

cies, ultra-violet, infra-red,

X-rays.

The machine made no reply. It

had nothing to say.

Then it saw the first robot

probe, which descended and

hovered above the chasm.

(con't)

NARRATOR (con't)

Then, it dropped into darkness.

The great machine knew that this

tiny scout was reporting back to

its parent; but it was too simple,

too primative a device to detect

the forces that were gathering

round it now.

Then the pod came, carrying

life. The great machine searched

its memories.

The logic circuits made their

decision when the pod had fallen

beyond the last faint glow of the

reflected Saturnian light.

In a moment of time, too short to

be measured, space turned and

twisted upon itself.
