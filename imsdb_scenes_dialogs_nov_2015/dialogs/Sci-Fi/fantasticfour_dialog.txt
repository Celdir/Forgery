FANTASTIC FOUR

by

Mark Frost and Michael France

based on the Marvel comic book by

Stan Lee and Jack Kirby

Shooting Script

REED

High open space, exposed structural

elements.  Obviously aimed at first

time visitors to create feelings of...

smallness, inadequacy.

BEN

Good thing it ain't workin... Reed,

what are we doing here?  This guy's

fast-food, strip-mall science --

REED

This wasn't our first stop, in case

you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not

that bad.  He's just a little...

(seeing the statue)

Larger than life.

REED

He's financed some of the biggest

breakthroughs of this century.

BEN

You'd never know it.

BEN (CONT'D)

Jesus.  That too?

REED

Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see --

FEMALE RECEPTIONIST

Executive elevator, top floor.

BEN

What's the price for a smile round here?

REED (O.S.)

My research suggests that exposure to

a high-energy cosmic storm born on

solar winds might have triggered the

evolution of early planetary life.

REED (CONT'D)

In six weeks another cloud with the

same elemental profile will pass

Earth's orbit.  A study in space could

advance our knowledge about the

structure of the human genome, and

help cure countless diseases, extend

human life --

REED (CONT'D)

Give kids the chance to be stronger,

healthier, less prone to --

SHADOWED FIGURE

Turn it off.  Please.

REED

But I haven't fully explained my --

SHADOWED FIGURE

Yes you have... Imagination.

Creativity.  Passion.  Those were

always your trademarks.

VICTOR

But dreams don't pay the bills, do

they?

(a condescending smile)

Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist.

Still reaching for the stars, with the

world on your back.

REED

You remember in school we talked about

working together.  That's what I was

about to explain...

VICTOR

So it's not my money you want.  It's

my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't

trust you, why should I?

VICTOR (CONT'D)

That's my job.  To stay a step ahead.

To know what other men don't.

BEN

I can't take this.

REED

(low, quiet)

Ben.  This is business.  Just work.

SUE (O.S.)

He's right, Ben.

SUE (CONT'D)

It's just business.

VICTOR

I think you both know my Director of

Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

BEN

Heya Susie.

(under breath, to Reed)

One more thing he's got.

SUE

Ben, it's been too long.

REED

You're, you've, I mean, how have you

bee--

SUE

Never better.

VICTOR

This isn't going to be a problem, is

it?

REED

Not at all.

SUE

Ancient history.

VICTOR

Good.  Then you're just in time to

hear the great Reed Richards ask me

for help.

(to Reed)

You know, you made a lot of folks at

MIT feel like a junior high science

fair.  So you'll excuse me if I savor

the moment.

REED

You back this mission, and I'll sign

over a fair percentage of any

applications or --

VICTOR

The number's seventy-five.  And it's

applications and patents.

BEN

What about his first born?

REED

(quiet)

Ben, the money's not important.  We

could save lives.

VICTOR

Twenty-five percent of a billion is

enough to keep the lights on, isn't

it?  Maybe even pay off your fourth

mortgage on the Baxter Building.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Deal...?

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Well then, to our future.  Together.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

REED

Hilarious.

VICTOR

If Reed's right, then this little trip

will double our stock offering.

LEONARD

And if he's not...?

VICTOR

Reed's always right.  Good thing he

doesn't always know what he's got...

BEN

He knew about NASA.  What if he made

the call to shut us down --

REED

Ben, think about all the people we can

help if this works --

BEN

Maybe you should think about yourself

for once.  You always let this guy

push you round --

REED

We got what we wanted.  That's

enough.

BEN

I know, I know.  I'm just worried

about what he wants... Speaking of

which...

SUE

You sure about this, Reed?

REED

Those solar winds are flaring, but I

factored them into my coordinates and --

SUE

I was talking about us.  Working

together.

REED

(thinking, talking fast)

Well, uh, based on our history...you

can handle the biogenetics, and I'll

focus on the molecular physics.  Or,

uhm, maybe I should take the biotech,

you work the microscopes, since you

have some background in electropho--

SUE

(droll, a little annoyed)

Right.  That's exactly what I meant.

BEN

Way to not overthink it.

(to Sue)

So when do we leave?

SUE

I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in

the morning to talk about resources

and crew.

REED

I, uh, think I remember the number.

SUE

It's been changed.

REED

As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could

pilot the mission --

SUE

Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun,

but we already have a pilot on our

payroll.  You remember my brother

Johnny...

BEN

Can't do it.  I cannot do it.

REED

External SRBs, orbital system engines.

Its just like the shuttles you flew

in --

BEN

No.  I cannot take orders from that

underwear model.  That wingnut washed

out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria

Secret wannabes into a flight

simulator.

REED

Youthful high spirits.

BEN

They crashed it into a wall.  A flight

simulator.

REED

I'm sure he's matured since then.

REED (CONT'D)

When have I asked you to do something

you absolutely said you could not do?

BEN

Five times.

REED

I had it at four.

BEN

This makes five.

JOHNNY (O.S.)

Captain on the bridge!

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

Digital camera: $254.  Memory stick:

$59.  The look on your hard-ass former

CO's grill when he finds out he's your

junior officer: priceless.

BEN

I can handle the ship.  I can even

handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I

don't know if I should be flying or

playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the

hell came up with them?

SUE

Victor did.

SUE (CONT'D)

The synthetics act as a second skin,

adapting to your individual needs to --

JOHNNY

Keep the hot side hot, and the cool

side cool!

REED

Wow.  Fantastic.

REED (CONT'D)

Material made from self-regulating

unstable molecules.  I've been working

on a formula for this.

SUE

Great minds think alike.

VICTOR (O.S.)

Guess some think faster than others.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

I hired Armani to design the pattern.

These colors will look great on

camera.

LEONARD

They're ready for you, sir.

VICTOR

Showtime.

LEONARD

Our numbers are through the roof.  The

IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a

share.  The bank's five times

oversubscribed --

VICTOR

It's not just the money.  I could make

money in my sleep.

LEONARD

Then what is it?

VICTOR

History, Leonard.  History.

Everything else is conversation...

(a beat)

How's the other matter?

LEONARD

Harry Winston sends his regards.

VICTOR

Today we stand on the edge of a new

frontier.  In the furthest depths of

outer space...we will find the secrets

to inner space.  The final key to

unlocking our genetic code lies in a

cosmic storm...

BEN

Isn't that your speech?

REED

He's made a few changes.

BEN

This is your dream, Reed.  You should

be the one up there.

REED

Victor's better at these things.

BEN

I'll be watching over you.

DEBBIE

Just get back soon, or I start looking

for a new groom.

BEN

Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that

in for a bigger rock.

DEBBIE

I don't care about rocks, I care about

you.

(to Reed)

You bring him back in one piece, or

you can forget being Best Man.

BEN

What the hell you smiling at?  Just

keep your mouth shut, and your mind on

those SMBs --

JOHNNY

Actually, the engines are SMEs.

Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant.

Couple generations past your last

ride.

(at the threshold)

I'm not as dumb as you look.

VICTOR

Think of a world without genetic flaws

-- no asthma, allergies, baldness,

breast cancer...

BEN

What's wrong with being bald...?

VICTOR

Darwin discovered evolution.  Now we --

I -- will define it.  Only in America

could...

VICTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...a little country boy from Latveria

build one of the biggest companies in

the world, and truly reach the stars.

Now if you'll excuse me, history

awaits...

JOHNNY

(a "dad voice": to Ben)

If you behave, maybe next time

daddy'll let you drive.

BEN

Keep talking, there won't be a next

time.

SUE

Long way from the projection booth at

the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?

REED

Yes.  Yes it is.

VICTOR

(to ground; via comm-link)

Leonard, how's the feed?

LEONARD (V.O.)

Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.

SUE

We can monitor the cloud's approach

and observe the tests from here.

BEN

Is it safe?

REED

The shields on the station should

protect us.

BEN

Should?

VICTOR

What's wrong, Ben?  Eighty-million

dollars worth of equipment not enough

for you?

REED

Let's start loading those samples.

Get your suit ready, Ben.

VICTOR

So you still do all the heavy lifting?

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Maybe you should have stayed back in

the lab.  Field work never suited you.

BEN

He does the talking.  I do the

walking.  Got it?

VICTOR

Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm

going to borrow Susan for a second.

REED

Sure.

JOHNNY

Please tell me your dawg's not trying

to rekindle things with my sister.

BEN

'Course not.  Strictly business.

JOHNNY

Yeah, well, his eyes say different.

BEN

Hey, two hearts got busted last time.

Maybe she's not over it either.

JOHNNY

Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the

year, more coin than God?  Or Reed,

the world's dumbest smart guy worth

less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's

a toss-up.

BEN

Put your tiny little mind at ease.

JOHNNY

Don't you wander off, boy.

VICTOR

Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?

SUE

I understand the business reasons.

VICTOR

Well, when you're looking at your

future, it never hurts to find closure

about the past.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Susan, every man dreams that he'll

meet some woman he can give the world

to.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

In my case, it's not just a metaphor.

REED

No...no...impossible.  It's...too

fast.

VICTOR

You've been with me two years now.

SUE

It's been a good two years, Victor...

The company's accomplished so much.

VICTOR

Right, of course, the company... But

you see, I've come to realize all the

accomplishments in the world mean

nothing without someone to share them

with --

SUE

Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done

something to make you think...

VICTOR

Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of

taking big steps.  And this is the

biggest step yet.  If it helps, think

of this as a promotion.  A merger of

sorts...

(getting closer)

Four little words that can change our

lives...

REED

The cloud is accelerating!

REED (CONT'D)

I don't know what happened.

REED (CONT'D)

We've got minutes until it hits, not

hours...Victor, that storm's deadly --

the radiation's lethal.  We need to

abort.

VICTOR

Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all

this way to lose our nerve at the

first little glitch.  Just close the

shields...

REED

Ben's still out there --

VICTOR

So reel him in.  But we came here to

do a job.  So let's do it.  Quickly.

REED (ON RADIO)

Ben, we need you back inside.

BEN (INTO RADIO)

I ain't done arranging your flowers,

egghead.

REED (ON RADIO)

Ben.  This is serious.  Turn around.

BEN (INTO RADIO)

Roger that, on my way.

AUTOMATED VOICE

Event threshold in two minutes.

REED

Come on, Ben, come on...

VICTOR (ON RADIO)

Reed, we're running out of time.

SUE

Johnny... Reed...

VICTOR

Reed, you need to get up here so we

can close the shields!  Now!

REED (ON RADIO)

Not until Ben is back inside!

VICTOR

It's too late for him, and soon it'll

be too late for all of us.

SUE

What are you doing?

VICTOR

Raising the shields.

SUE

You can't leave them out there.

VICTOR

Watch me.  Reed had his chance.  You

can't help them any more than I can.

SUE

I can try.

REED

Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the

command center.  Close the shields.

JOHNNY

What about you?

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

(to Ben)

Come on big guy, you can do it!

AUTOMATED VOICE

Event threshold in thirty seconds.

AUTOMATED VOICE

Event threshold in ten seconds.

TEN...

SUE

Johnny!  Reed!

AUTOMATED VOICE

FIVE...FOOOOUUUR...

REED

He's not responsive --

JOHNNY

Ben!  Ben!

JOHNNY'S VOICE

Ben, wake up!  Wake up!

BEN (O.S.)

Where...where am I?

JOHNNY

Back on Earth.  Victor's medical

facility... We're in quarantine.

BEN (O.S.)

Reed? ... Sue?

JOHNNY

They're fine.  Everybody else...is

fine.

BEN (O.S.)

What's wrong with me?

JOHNNY

I swear to you they've done everything

humanly possible.  The best plastic

surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had

the best --

BEN (O.S.)

Give me a mirror...

JOHNNY

They said that's not such a good idea,

the shock alone could --

BEN (O.S.)

Give me the god damn mirror!

JOHNNY

Unfortunately, the doctors just

couldn't do anything to fix your face!

JOHNNY

Nice 'do.  Going for the "grandpa"

look?

REPORTER #1

You've been accused in the past of

moving science a little too fast --

VICTOR

Accused by who?  My competitors?

REPORTER #2

But surely this accident gives you

pause --

VICTOR

Danger is always part of discovery.

What would have happened if Ben

Franklin never went out in a storm?

Without risk, there's no reward.

REPORTER #3

So where's the reward?  You promised a

cure-all.

VICTOR

And you'll have it.  I've never come

up short.  And I'm not going to start

now.

REPORTER #2

So you're still taking VDI public --

VICTOR

Yes, of course.  I've never been more

confident in the compan--

REED

How's she doing?

DOCTOR

Stable.  Vitals are strong.

REED

Blood panels show no irradiation.

Good.  You'll step up this protocol,

every --

DOCTOR

Four hours.  We know what we're

doing... One more day of observation,

then you're all cleared.

REED

Sue...I want to tell you...I'm...

REED (CONT'D)

She's allergic to orchids.  Put that

Amaryllis Apapathos by her bed.  The

African lilies?  They're her

favorites.

SEXY NURSE

And where do we think we're going?

JOHNNY

I don't know if "we've" noticed, but

the sickest runs this side of the Alps

are right outside that window --

NURSE

I've noticed... But doctor's orders,

you're not allowed to leave until we --

JOHNNY

Finish the tests, I know -- could you

give me a hand with this zipper?

NURSE

You know this is not a ski resort.

JOHNNY

Not yet.

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

Luckily grandma still sends care

packages.

NURSE

You are trouble.

JOHNNY

(thermometer in his mouth)

Brubbles my Triddle Name.

SEXY NURSE

You're hot!

JOHNNY

So are you!

SEXY NURSE

I mean, you feel a little feverish.

JOHNNY

I've never felt better in my life.

When do you get off work?

SEXY NURSE

My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --

JOHNNY

Meet me at 4:01, top of the run.

That'll give you a minute to freshen

up.

BEN

How long was I out?

REED

Three days.  I was worried about you.

How are you feeling?

BEN

Solid.

BEN (CONT'D)

How you doing?

REED

I don't know.  I just keep going over

and over the numbers.

BEN

Reed.  Even you can't compute every

little thing.

REED

I should have done more, run more

tests --

BEN

It was a freak of nature.  Last I

checked, you don't have a crystal

ball.  Let it go.

BEN (CONT'D)

You go through something like this,

makes you appreciate having the right

woman in your life.

REED

Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --

BEN

Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.

REED

What?  Come on.  She's got a good

thing with Victor --

BEN

I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen

your screws?

REED

He's smart, powerful, successful --

BEN

Well maybe you should date him.

REED

Ben.  He'll give her the life she

deserves.  She ended up with the right

guy.  Things worked out for the best.

BEN

Do I have to do everything myself?

JOHNNY

Me like-y.

SEXY NURSE

Stay right.  Left is trouble.

JOHNNY

I though we went over this.

SEXY NURSE

Last one down springs for room

service.

SEXY NURSE

You're on fire!

JOHNNY

Not this again --

SEXY NURSE

No: You're ON FIRE!

JOHNNY

Care to join me?

VICTOR

How's the IPO?

LEONARD

Stable.  We're looking at low

twenties.  It's a good number,

considering the fallout from --

VICTOR

Reed's disaster.  You know, I half-

think he did this to me on purpose.

LEONARD

Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

VICTOR

Get me on the AM shows, Larry King,

cover of the Journal...

(staring into silver tray)

I've got to do something about this

scar.  Make sure they only shoot my

right side.

LEONARD

Actually, uh, people seem to think the

scar "humanizes" you.

VICTOR

And that's a good thing?

LEONARD

You know, maybe you should get some

rest --

VICTOR

Later.  First, I've got some

unfinished business.  A deal that

needs closing...

LEONARD

Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue?

You could have any woman in the world

but --

VICTOR

That's why.  Because I could have

any other woman... You know, when

they asked Caesar "why England," he

said, "because it's not mine."

SUE

I can only stay for one drink, Ben.

I've got to meet with Victor.

BEN

Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

BEN (CONT'D)

Hey Reed, what are you doing here?

(before he can answer)

Great, why don't you join us?

BEN (CONT'D)

God, I'm starving.  Gonna hit the

buffet.

BEN

Pardon me...

REED

Are you alright?

BEN

I think I need to lie down.  Bad

shrimp.

BEN (CONT'D)

Really bad shrimp.

REED

Feeling better?

SUE

Yes, thanks.

REED

That's good.  That's uh...good.

SUE

You always had a way with words.

(an awkward beat)

I should be getting back.

REED

I'm really happy for you and Victor.

SUE

You're happy for me and Victor.

REED

I can tell you guys are enjoying what

was the best part of our relationship --

SUE

Which was?

REED

Passion.

REED (CONT'D)

For science.

SUE

(frustrated)

You are such a dork, Reed... You never

got it and never will unless it's

explained to you in quantum physics.

REED

What?  What did I say?

SUE

It's never what you say.  It's what

you don't say. What you don't do...

REED

I...I...I just wanted to --

SUE

It's been two years, and all you can

say is you're happy for me and some

other guy...

(standing up, hurt)

You know, Victor may be a lot of

things, but at least he's not afraid

to fight for what he wants...

(Reed looks down)

And it's nice to be wanted sometimes.

To be heard...seen... Reed, look at

me.

REED

Uh, Sue...?  I can't.

SUE

What?  What do you mean you --

REED

Sue...look at your hands.

JOHNNY (O.S.)

You guys will not believe what just

happened!

SUE

It has to be the cloud.  It's

fundamentally altered our DNA.

REED

Let's not jump to conclusions, we need

a massive amount of evidence before

making that leap.

JOHNNY

Now what is up with that?

REED

(deadpan)

The cloud has fundamentally altered

our DNA.

JOHNNY

Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?

SUE

Apparently I can disappear.

JOHNNY

Please tell me you go silent too.

REED

We have to find Ben.

JOHNNY

Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame

off --

SUE

Johnny.

SUE (CONT'D)

Stop it.

JOHNNY

Okay, "mom."

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my

nurse!

REED (O.S.)

Ben, are you there?

SUE (O.S.)

Open up Ben, we need to talk.

BEN

LEAVE ME ALONE!!!

JOHNNY

Ewwwwwwww.  That is disgusting.

REED

...Ben?

JOHNNY

What is that thing?

SUE

I think that thing is Ben.

VICTOR

What's going on?

SUE

Victor, are you feeling alright?

VICTOR

Just a little banged up.  A couple

scrapes.  Why?

REED

Ben did this.

VICTOR

Ben did this?

REED

He's had some kind of...reaction to

exposure from the cloud.  And he's not

the only one.

SUE

We need to find him.

SUE (CONT'D)

Victor, I'm sorry I --

VICTOR

(cold)

Just find him.

JOHNNY

Anybody know where the big guy's

going?

REED

He's going home.

BEN

Hello, Operator?

BEN (CONT'D)

Deb... It's me.  I need you to step

out front.

DEBBIE

Out front?  You home, baby?  I got

a surprise for you.

BEN

I got a surprise for you too.

DEBBIE

Ben?

BEN (O.S.)

Don't come any closer for a sec.  This

is gonna be kind of a shock... You

remember when we said "together

forever no matter what"?

DEBBIE

Baby, you're scaring me.

DEBBIE

Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to

Ben?

BEN

Deb, it's me.  It's still me.

DEBBIE

Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME!

BEN

I love you, Deb.

VICTOR

Make sure you find Ben, bring him back

here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't

need this to hit the press.

LEONARD

Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at

eight, then a nine-thirty interview

with the Journal --

VICTOR

Front page?

LEONARD

Top left, like you asked.

(a smile)

Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who

knows...maybe Washington.

VICTOR

Leonard.  Think bigger.

BEN

A few days in space, it'll be great,

what's the worst that could happen?

BEN (CONT'D)

Perfect.  Thanks.

BEN (CONT'D)

You think you got trouble?  Take a

good look, pal, how bad could it be?

BEN (CONT'D)

Okay, easy there, buddy.

BEN (CONT'D)

You had to choose my spot, didn't you?

BEN (CONT'D)

This is really not my day.

BEN

A little help here?!  You wanna hit

that button, sir?

COP

FREEZE!  PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT

DOWN!

JOHNNY

Not even Ben deserves that.

BRIDGE COP

Back!  We're evac-ing the bridge.

SUE

What now?  Reed...?  What do we do?

SUE (CONT'D)

Ben's out there.  Let's go get him.

BRIDGE COP

Maybe you didn't hear me.  Those cars

are gonna blow sky high, any second.

REED

Look, we've got a friend out there in

trouble.  We need to get to him before --

BRIDGE COP #2

Nobody gets past this point.

SUE

What?

REED

(mutters)

We need to get past them.

BRIDGE COP #1

What the hell is this?  A magic show?

REED

Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.

SUE

What...?

(realizes)

Oh.

JOHNNY

This is wrong in so many ways.

REED

You've been working out.

SUE

Shut up.

SUE (CONT'D)

Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you

should strip down next, see how it

feels to have fifty people staring --

REED

Uh, Sue?

SUE (INVISIBLE)

Oh.  Well then...

JOHNNY

I'm gonna need serious therapy.

BEN

What the --!

REED

Ben.  Are you okay?

BEN

Am I okay?!  You wanna explain that?!

BEN (CONT'D)

Or this?!  What the hell am I? 'Cause

I sure ain't Ben anymore.

SUE (O.S.)

REED!  BEN!  LOOK OUT!

REED

I swear to you, I will do everything

in my power until there is not a

breath left in me: you are going to be

Ben again.

LEONARD

Uh, sir...Larry King called, to

cancel.

(seeing the TV, a beat)

Apparently, there's a bigger story.

CHIEF FIREMAN

There's some folks outside, want to

talk to you.

REED

We're not going public with this.

We're scientists, not celebrities.

CHIEF FIREMAN

Too late, son.

CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)

That's what they're calling you.  The

Fantastic Four.

JOHNNY

Nice.

SUE

Johnny, slow down.  Let's think this

through, a second.

JOHNNY

Okay.  Done thinking.

CHIEF FIREMAN

So which one of you's the leader?

JOHNNY

That'd be me.

CHIEF FIREMAN

No seriously.

CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)

You're on, son.  They all want a

statement.

REED

Uh, during our recent mission to the

Von Doom space station, we were

exposed to as yet-unidentified

radioactive energy, most likely some

kind of nucleotide compoun--

VARIOUS REPORTERS

What happened on the bridge?  Does it

hurt to stretch?  Were you really on

fire?  Is it true that one of you can

fly?

JOHNNY

Working on it.  And it's a lot harder --

SUE

We don't know much more than you do,

at this point.  Which is why we will

be going directly to the lab, where we

can diagnose our symptoms and --

REPORTER #2

Symptoms?  So it's like a disease?

JOHNNY

Symptoms?  Please.  If having powers

is a disease, then yeah we got it.

And we are gonna blow your minds.

There's a new day dawning.  The day of

the Fantastic Four.

REPORTER #3

That thing doesn't look too fantastic.

REED

Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero

who's been through a terrible orde--

JOHNNY

What he's trying to say is: every team

needs a mascot...

REED

Look, we went up to space to find a

way to understand DNA, to cure

disease, save lives.  Well, now it's

our DNA, our disease, our lives on the

line...

(a beat)

Thank you.  No more questions.

BEN

Be nice.

NED CECIL

Well, Victor, the bank would like to

congratulate you.  On the fastest

freefall since the Depression.  We

can't even give your stock away.

VICTOR

Ned, you know I can turn this around.

NED CECIL

You promised a cure-all, and came back

with this.  Who the hell's going to

invest in a biotech company that turns

its workers into circus freaks?

VICTOR

(pointed)

I really appreciate all your support.

NED CECIL

You've got a week, Victor.  One week

to turn this around.  Or we pull

out...

(a beat)

This meeting is over.

VICTOR

Goddamn book-keeper doesn't know

preferred stock from livestock.

LEONARD

Sir.  Reed's comments at that press

conference killed us.  How are we

going to turn this around?

VICTOR

Very simple.  I cure them.  If I can

cure these freaks, then I can cure

anyone.  What better way to restore my

reputation?

JOHNNY

Smile, Ben.  They want to like you.

Give 'em your good side.  Or your less

bad side.

BEN

Uh...don't do drugs.

O'HOOLIHAN

Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr.

Richards.  All that for you?

REED

I'm afraid so...

SUE

Jimmy.  Good to see you again.

O'HOOLIHAN

Good to see you too... Don't worry,

sir.  I know how crowded that head of

yours is.

REED

Any visitors while I was away?

O'HOOLIHAN

Just the usual.  Told 'em you were

circling round outer space.

REED

We had a tough year.

BEN

Yeah, nine years straight.

JOHNNY

Twenty?  From outside the place looks

a lot taller.

REED

Oh, it is.

JOHNNY

Either we're moving really fast...or

not at all.

BEN

I'll take the stairs.

SUE

How come Ben can't turn it on and off

like us?

REED

That's what we're here to find out.

SUE

If it happened to him, then it

could...

JOHNNY

Wait.  You mean there's chance we

could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?

SUE

Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run

around on fire for the rest of your

life?

JOHNNY

Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I

can't be the only one who thinks

this is cool.

REED

We should stay here until we can

define the extent of our changes...

JOHNNY

This place is deluxe.  You got cable?

REED

(hearing Ben's FOOTSTEPS)

...and figure out how to reverse them.

Let me show you to your rooms.

VICTOR

God, I've been so worried about you.

SUE

Victor, your scar --

VICTOR

I told you, I'm fine.  It's you I'm

worried about.

SUE

I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --

VICTOR

Please, no apologies.  I've arranged

for your things to be moved to one of

my condos.  You'll have round-the

clock care.

SUE

Thank you, that's generous, but I

think I should stay here.  With my

brother.  Until we get a handle on

this.

VICTOR

Sue.  I think you should let my

doctors have a look at you.

REED (O.S.)

Victor!  What are you doing here?

VICTOR

I'm starting to wonder the same

thing... How much do you know about

what happened to you?

REED

Not much.  We need to run tests to see

the extent of the damage.

VICTOR

Well, let me know if there is anything

I can do.  We're all in this together

now.

REED

Victor wait... I just wanted to say,

I'm sorry the mission didn't go as

planned --

VICTOR

Didn't go as planned?  It was a

catastrophe.  You ruined the lives of

four people --

REED

I ruined?  With all due respect, I

told you to abort --

VICTOR

Abort?  Reed, I put my company, my

name, billions of dollars on the line,

and I will not let you make me look

like a fool --

REED

Victor, if we could understand what

happened to us --

VICTOR

I don't want to understand it.  This

isn't one of your science projects.  I

just want to fix it.  Fast!

VOICE (O.S.)

There a problem, Vic?

VICTOR

No problem, Ben.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Just pay your goddamn electric bill,

and get to work on a cure.

BEN

You got a chisel round here?

REED

If we're going to identify the source

of the mutation, we need to isolate

your recombinant DNA so we can

activate positional genomes.

SUE

We need to give you a physical, so we

know what got zapped.

BEN

Well why didn't you say so?  You want

me to lift some weights or something?

REED

No, just sit back.  We have a good

sense of your strength from the

firetruck.  We need to find the source

of your strength.

BEN

How bad is it?  You know I used to

smoke.

REED

Okay, this might smart a little.

REED (CONT'D)

(high-pitched voice)

We'll...continue this later.

REED

Back it down, Johnny!

JOHNNY

I can go hotter!

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

You're really cramping my style here.

SUE

You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter,

you're approaching supernova --

JOHNNY

Sweet.

SUE

That's the temperature of the sun.

REED

Not only could you kill yourself, but

you could set fire to Earth's

atmosphere and destroy all human life

as we know it.

JOHNNY

Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.

SUE

He cooked the equipment.

REED

Okay.  I've uh, got some questions,

from Sue.  That she thought might be

better coming from me... Can you, you

know, go to the bathroom...like

normal...

BEN

Yeah.

(a beat)

You don't wanna know the details.

REED

Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --

BEN

Not unless you want that clipboard

stretched up your --

REED

O-kay.  We'll skip that question.

REED

Is there something about flames?

About flaming, that you --

JOHNNY

What are you trying to say?  Just

because I dress well and like to dance --

REED

(confused)

What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out

why we each ended up with different

symptoms.

JOHNNY

Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot.

You're...well, you're a little limp.

Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's

always been a hardass.

(a beat)

Why aren't you writing this down?

REED

It's not "invisibility" per se.

You're bending the light around you

with some kind of malleable force

field.  That's what you projected on

the Bridge.

SUE

What about you?  You haven't eaten in

days.  How come you're never on this

side of the microscope?

SUE (CONT'D)

Bruises...from the bridge?

REED

Have you had any side-effects, from

your powers?

SUE

I've had some headaches.  Migraines.

REED

You should be able to bend light

around other objects, even people, if

you could control your emotional state

better --

SUE

Excuse me?

REED

I'm saying, if you had a little more

self control, you could locate the

trigger.  Can you remember the exact

emotions when --

SUE

Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.

REED

Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate

that feeling?  Some memory or...

SUE

(staring right at him)

I'm sure I can come up with something.

REED

How's that coming -- whoa --

SUE

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to

do that... You must think that was

some kind of latent hostility or --

REED

What in the world would give me that

idea?

REED (CONT'D)

I mean, you broke up with me, right?

SUE

Are you kidding?

REED

No, I distinctly remember: you walked

out my door.  Ergo...

SUE

Reed.  I was ready for the next step,

you weren't, ergo, I walked.

REED

I think it was a little more

complicated than --

SUE

I just wanted to share an apartment.

What was so complicated about that?

REED

There were a lot of variables to

consider --

SUE

No.  There weren't.  There was you.

And me.  No variables, no math.  It

was actually the simplest thing in the

world.  But your head got in the way...

like it always does.

REED

Sue...I just...I thought...

SUE

Same old Reed.  Too much thinking...

JOHNNY

Okay guys, we have a serious problem.

REED (V.O.)

Our uniforms were exposed to the storm

like us.  So they can transform like

us, becoming invisible, changing size

on demand or remaining impervious to

flame.

BEN

You look like an eighties rock band.

SUE

(to Ben)

The suit will stretch.  You should try

it --

BEN

I wouldn't be caught dead in that.

JOHNNY

He's right.  These costumes are...

missing something.  I can't put my

finger on it --

REED

They're not costumes.

SUE

We're not taking them out.  Johnny, we

need to stay here till we've stabilized.

JOHNNY

I'm getting sick of being trapped

here.  NASA wasn't even this strict!

BEN

(looking at uniform)

Maybe it's missing a utility belt.

VICTOR (V.O.)

So what's the prognosis?

DOCTOR

Your tissue, your organs, your entire

biophysical structure is changing.

Every system is still functioning,

somehow --

VICTOR

And they're changing into...

DOCTOR

I don't really know.  A compound

organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than

titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than

diamonds --

VICTOR

Like the shields Reed said would

protect us.

(cold fury, deadly focus)

How long?

DOCTOR

At this rate, the infection should be

complete in two, maybe three weeks --

VICTOR

What do you mean "complete"?

DOCTOR

I wish I could tell you.  I can't

pretend to know what we're dealing

with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --

VICTOR

What?

DOCTOR

The Center for Disease Control.  If

this thing is contagious --

VICTOR

Look at me.  I have a life.  I'm the

face of a billion-dollar-company... We

need to keep this confidential,

understand?

DOCTOR

But...this disease...is progressive...

degenerative...

VICTOR

That's terrible news...

VICTOR (CONT'D)

...but I think I'll get a second

opinion.

REED

Nothing...nothing...nothing...

REED (CONT'D)

Of course...of course...the cloud...

SUE

What are you doing?

REED

(fast, charged)

The plants, from space.  Their

particles are still charged.  With the

right amount of energy, those ions

could create the elemental profile of

the cosmic storm.

REED

If we can build a machine to re-create

the storm, we can reverse the polarity --

SUE

(realizing)

And reverse the mutations --

REED

(talking more to himself)

Curing countless diseases, not just

ours.

SUE

But we're the focus, right Reed?

Reed...?

REED

Of course.  Of course.

SUE

And you sure you can control this

thing?  Last time didn't work out so

well.

REED

(preoccupied, mind

spinning)

With the right energy, we can

stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into

the city grid...

SUE

You really need to get a janitor.

SUE (CONT'D)

This must be what it looks like inside

your head.

REED

There's a system to it.

REED (CONT'D)

Wait!  Sue, don't touch tha--

SUE

Sorry.  My fault.  I won't...touch

anything.

LEONARD

Is Reed any closer to a cure?

VICTOR

The only thing he's closer to is

Sue...

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Make me a reservation for two at

Cipriani tonight.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

And get this over to Ben Grimm.

WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Close your eyes, baby.  Keep 'em

closed.

WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

You surprised?

BEN (ON SCREEN)

Yeah I'm surprised.  Surprised the

fire department didn't shut this down.

THE THING

God.  I was good looking.

DEBBIE (ON SCREEN)

What did you wish for, honey?

BEN (ON SCREEN)

I already got it.  Everything I want.

VOICE (O.S.)

Damn, Stretch!

JOHNNY

How far's that rubber bend?

REED

That's what I'm trying to calculate.

And it's not rubber.  It's muscle,

tendon.  I seem to have the ability to

manipulate the malleability of my

molecular structure and redistribute

my density to --

JOHNNY

Right, whatever, have fun.

BEN

That's not funny!

ERNIE

Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first

mook from Brooklyn to go to outer

space, so pay him some respect!

BEN

Ernie.  Sorry for killing your

business.  I'll take the usual, then

I'm out... Better make it a double.

ALICIA

Who killed the party?

ERNIE (O.S.)

Make it a triple.  On the house,

Benny.

BEN

If there's a God, she hates me.

ALICIA

I don't think She's real big on hate.

BEN

You wouldn't say that, if you could

see me.

ALICIA

Can I...?  See you...?

ALICIA (CONT'D)

It's okay, I won't bite...

(feeling his arm)

...not that I could.

ALICIA (CONT'D)

Such a sad face... You know, sometimes

being different isn't a bad thing.

BEN

Trust me, this ain't one of those

times.

ALICIA

See you round, Benny...

ALICIA (CONT'D)

I'm Alicia, by the way.

VICTOR

Thank you for coming out to see me.

SUE

You said it was urgent.

VICTOR

It is.  There's something we need to

talk about.  Something I need to ask

you...

SUE

(slow, careful)

Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I

want you to know I appreciate

everything you've done for me, but I

just don't --

VICTOR

Susan.  What are you doing?

VICTOR (CONT'D)

You think I brought you here to talk

about us?  Please.  This is business.

(leaning forward, intense)

I need to know: how close is Reed

to finding to a cure?

SUE

He's working round the clock.  But the

data needs to be tested, analyzed

before --

VICTOR

Same old Reed.  All analysis, no

action.  Wasn't that the problem with

you two?

SUE

If these molecules aren't stable, they

could make us worse, maybe even kill

us.

VICTOR

Then why is Reed dragging his feet?

Maybe he likes having his prize

specimen under glass...

(closer, cruel)

It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally

the perfect woman for him...because

you're his science project.

SUE

Please don't make this personal --

VICTOR

Oh, I think you already have.

SUE

Victor, we can't do anything until the

research is ready.

VICTOR

"We," huh?

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Don't forget who you work for, Susan.

So get to work.  And do your job.

BUSINESSMAN

I wish my wife would disappear.

X GAMES ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have

a special guest for you... Johnny

Storm of the Fantastic Four!

JOHNNY

Hey, Ronnie Renner!  I'm a big fan.

KENNY BARTRAM

Heard you like to ride.  Wanna take

her for a spin?

RONNIE RENNER

Come on, bro.  I'll teach you some

tricks...if you can keep up.

X GAMES ANNOUNCER

A rock-solid double-flip!

X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

Look at that lift, ladies and

gentlemen!

X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

Frontside 360!  He's totally flat and

whipped!

X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

Whoa!  That's a...what is that?  A

720?

X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

He's going for a Kiss of Death!

X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

(hand over mic)

Is he......flying?

X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)

Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen!

You've just seen the first...the

first...TORCHFLIGHT!  The McTORCH!

JOHNNY

My bad.  Sorry about that.

(a glance to Ronnie)

Thanks for the lesson, bro.

SUE

That's new...

SUE (CONT'D)

Have you read these...?  From all

over.  People want us to fight crimes...

save their kids...solve their problems...

(no response from Reed)

...when we can't even solve our

own.

SUE (CONT'D)

Reed.  How close are we to a cure?

REED

No way to know.  Without more

tests, experiments.

SUE

We're not specimens, we're patients.

This isn't just another science

project to you, is it...?

BEN (O.S.)

NO...NO...NO FREAKIN' WAY!!

REED

BEN!  What?  What's going on!?

X GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)

So what can you tell us about the

outfit?

JOHNNY (ON TV)

Not too much, but I will say that it's

all weather and no leather.  Kind of

Armani meets Astronaut.

SUE

He didn't.

BEN

Oh, he did.

SUE

What did he do to the uniform?!

REED

He talked me into it.

X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)

So what are your superhero names?

JOHNNY (ON TV)

I go by the Human Torch.  The ladies

call me Torch.

X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)

What about the rest of the team?

JOHNNY (ON TV)

Uh, we call my sister the invisible

girl...the Invisible Girl.

SUE

Girl...?!

X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)

That's easy to remember.  And Reed

Richards?  He's the leader.  So

what's he?  Mr. Fantastic?

JOHNNY

Well, I wouldn't say he's the leader.

BEN

Could be worse.

X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)

What about this one?  What do you call

this Thing?

JOHNNY

That's it.  Just The Thing.  We would

have gone with The Rock, but it was

taken.  And "Thing" pretty much sums

it up.

BEN

(matter-of-fact)

Okay.  I'm gonna go kill him now.

REED

Ben!  Slow down a second and --

X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)

Is it true what they say?  That he can

expand any part of his anatomy?

JOHNNY (ON TV)

Actually, between us, I think he's got

some problems staying rigid.

REED

(finishing his thought to Ben)

...wait for me...

X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)

Which may explain why this woman's

not smiling.

SUE

I'm driving.

JOHNNY (ON TV)

Dude.  That's my sister.

JOHNNY

(looking around)

Where's my ride?

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

What the?!  Is that my --

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

(shouting: to Ben)

You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.

(seeing Sue)

What?!

SUE

You gave us names?  What are you, the

"face" of the Fantastic Four now?

BEN

It's about to be a broken face.

REED

This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need

to be careful until we're normal

again.

JOHNNY

What if some of us don't want to be

"normal" again?  We didn't all turn

into monsters like --

BEN

Did you just --

BEN (CONT'D)

Okay, that's it, tinkerbell!  You want

to fly?  Fly.

JOHNNY

Let's see if we can get blood from a

stone.

SUE

You two need a time-out.

JOHNNY

Blockhead started it!

SUE

Damn it, Johnny.

REED

You need to control yourself and think

before you --

JOHNNY

Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if

we got these gifts for a reason?  What

if we have some, you know...like,

calling?

REED

A higher calling like getting girls

and making money?

JOHNNY

Is there any higher?

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

This is who we are Reed.  Accept it.

Or better yet: enjoy it.

SUE

Ben!  Slow down...

SUE (CONT'D)

He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny.

He's always been a hothead --

BEN

It's not him.  It's them.

(pointing to crowd)

I can't live like this.

SUE

Just give Reed a little more time.

You know how he works -- analyzing

every little step before he takes

one --

BEN

It's easy for you to be patient.

SUE

No, it's not.  I thought I was done

waiting for Reed... We're all in this

together now, Ben.

BEN

Together?  Look at me, Susie.  You got

no idea what I'd give...to be

invisible.  Your nightmare...is my

dream.

NED CECIL

This is how you "turn things around"?

These freaks are on the front page and

your company's in the obituaries.

VICTOR

I have a plan to use their publicity

for --

NED CECIL

Victor, stop.  The bank's lost enough

already.  This isn't a negotiation.

It's a notification.  We're pulling

out.

VICTOR

You need to look long-term here.

Without risk, there's no --

NED CECIL

Reward.  We all know the sales

pitch, Vic.  And frankly, we're

done buying... Gentlemen.

NED CECIL

Hello...?

NED CECIL (CONT'D)

(relieved, almost)

Von Doom?  Gave me a little shock.  No

hard feelings, right?  Nothing

personal.

NED CECIL (CONT'D)

You know, you could always move back

to Latvura, start fresh.

NED CECIL (CONT'D)

Maybe that's where you belong, back in

the "old country."

VICTOR

It's pronounced Latveria.

(looking down at the dead body)

This meeting's over, Ned.

NEWSCASTER (ON TV)

...the Fantastic Four put on quite a

show last night.  They landed in every

major headline in the northern

hemisphere.  In related news...

NEWSCASTER (ON TV) (CONT'D)

Reports have surfaced that Von Doom

Industries may be filing for

bankruptcy.  You may remember that it

was Victor Von Doom who...

LEONARD

Sir, is everything okay?  What

happened to your...?

VICTOR

(under breath, seething)

Reed... He got what he wanted...

(looking at Sue)

Everything he wanted...he took from me.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Now I'm going to take it back.  Piece

by bloody piece...

REED

Victor, are you...are you okay?

VICTOR

Don't worry about me.  Worry about

yourself.

REED

What are you doing here?

VICTOR

What I should have done a long time

ago.  Applications and patents, Reed.

This all belongs to me.

REED

But I'm not done with the machine --

VICTOR

Which is precisely the point.

Analysis is over.  It's time for

action.  My men could have mass-

produced this by now.

REED

Mass-produced?  This isn't a

toaster.  You have no idea how it

works.

VICTOR

Re-create the storm, invert the

polarity here, reverse the mutation

there.  Don't talk to me like I'm some

schoolboy.  I've got the same Phd you

do.

REED

The storm needs to be handled exactly

right, or it could make our mutations

worse, much worse, maybe even kill

us...

REED (CONT'D)

Victor, please.  We need time to

verify the data... We can't afford any

mistakes -- there's only enough ions

for two or three attempts.

VICTOR

Reed.  I'm not asking permission.

(a final verdict)

We'll build it, while you check the

specs.

SUE

Can I talk to you?

SUE

Don't let Victor push you into making

a mistake --

REED

He was going to take away all my data,

equipment --

SUE

Better than your life.  Victor's not

the one who has to get into that

thing.  We are.

REED

Which is why I'm working twenty hours

a day, checking every variable --

SUE

Every variable but yourself.  You

don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in

your head like --

REED

(finally losing it)

I'm not the only one in there.  I got

you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling

around in there.

SUE

So clear it out.  Get out of your

head.  Get out of here...

LITTLE GIRL

Mister, Mister!  Please help me!  My

kitty is stuck in a tree.

LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)

Please save Miss Lucy.

BEN

(under breath)

Eyebrows are a little big...

VOICE (O.S.)

I figured the only way to get you here

was to stick that in the window.

BEN

How'd you know it was me?

ALICIA

I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?

BEN

I'm not really dressed for a party.

ALICIA

Relax, it's casual.

BEN

No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...

BEN

Those yours too?

ALICIA

My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into

stone.  I was wondering when you'd

walk by.

THE THING

You know, you could'a run an ad in the

personals.

ALICIA

"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton,

rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual

relationship."

THE THING

This ain't permanent.  My friend

Reed's working on a cure...I think.

ALICIA

Bennie.  You feel pretty good as is.

THE THING

You don't know what it's like out

there.  Walking around like some kind

of circus freak.  People staring,

whispering --

ALICIA

I wouldn't know anything about that.

THE THING

I mean...

ALICIA

Tell me.  When you grew up in

Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you

know?

(a beat)

You went your own way then.  You

didn't listen to people.  So why start

now...?

VICTOR

Need a ride, Johnny?

VICTOR

A few fans.  Hope you don't mind.

JOHNNY

Gotta take care of the fans, right?

VICTOR

Look, I built my business knowing what

people want.  And right now, the

people want you.

JOHNNY

And we don't want to let the people

down now, do we?

VICTOR

No we don't.  Which is why we need

to strike while the iron's hot.

I'm talking action figures,

videogames, sponsors --

JOHNNY

Videogames?  You serious?

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

You talk to Reed and Sue about this?

VICTOR

Johnny.  Let's be honest here.  Ben,

Reed, Sue.  Good people, all.  But

stars?

(shaking his head, a beat)

I don't want to break up the band, but

you're the one they want.  Don't you

think it's time to go solo...?

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Take the car for a spin.  Think about

it.  Is this the life you want?  Or

would you rather live in Reed's

lab...?

REED

I could get Ben to tap into the

Baxter's main power to generate enough

voltage --

SUE

Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look

up.

SUE (CONT'D)

Remember our first date here...?  God,

I was so nervous.

REED

You were?

SUE

Of course I was.  I'd read all your

papers on bioethics.  Some of them two

times just so I'd have something to

say to you.

REED

You know, I bribed the projectionist

ten bucks to keep it open late?

SUE

I gave him twenty.

SUE (CONT'D)

I didn't want that night to end.

REED

Sue, you were right.  It wasn't

complicated.  I just wasn't ready to

be...to become...

(a beat)

You can be a little intimidating.

REED (CONT'D)

You always talked about how you liked

the kind of man who could approach

you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't

afraid to tell you what he wanted.

SUE

I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted

you to be that man.

SUE (CONT'D)

When I walked out, I waited ten

minutes outside your door.  Ten.

Waiting for you to come find me.

REED

Why didn't you say something?

SUE

That would have kinda defeated the

purpose.  And Reed...

(closer, emotional)

I'm saying it now.

SUE (CONT'D)

(quiet, playful)

Come find me.

SUE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

That's my nose, genius... These are my

lips.

ALICIA

Look around.  I'll get us drinks.

They always let blind girls cut the

line.

PATRON

I don't know about this one.  It lacks

a certain...realism.

BOHEMIAN GIRL #1

She's always had a thing for runaways

and strays, but this is ridiculous.

BOHEMIAN GIRL #2

I know.  Did she really think these

sculptures would sell?

BOHEMIAN GIRL #1

Like anybody would want this thing in

their house.  That girl's a one-woman

charity.

VICTOR (O.S.)

This seat taken?

BEN

What are you doing here?

VICTOR

I'm worried about you.

BEN

About me?  How sweet.

VICTOR

Come on.  Let me buy you something to

eat.  Looks like you could use the

company.

THE THING

'Scuse me.

VICTOR

I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't

changed that much for Reed, Sue and

Johnny.  At least they can go out in

public.  But for you?  People staring.

Whispering behind your back...

THE THING

If you're trying to cheer me up you're

doing a helluva job --

VICTOR

I'm just saying, I know what it's like

to lose something you love.  To see it

slip away, and know it's never coming

back.

THE THING

Reed's gonna fix me up --

VICTOR

For your sake I hope you're right.

I'm sorry if that sounds a little

skeptical.

THE THING

Skeptical...?

VICTOR

Look, he's a brilliant man, we should

trust he's working as hard as he can.

You're his best friend.  So what

possible reason could he have for

taking his time?

(a beat)

I mean, other than getting close to

Sue?

BEN

Yeah, I have that effect on people.

REED

Ben --

BEN

Oh, you remember my name do you?  You

happen to remember what you swore to

do with every breath in your body?

REED

We're working as hard as we can --

BEN

Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.

REED

Come on, this is nothing.

BEN

Glad "nothing" could take you away

from your work.

REED

Ben, I don't know if this thing'll

change us back or make us worse.

I need you to be patient for a little

while longe--

BEN

Look at me, Reed.  Look at me!

REED

I am looking.  That's why I can't make

a mistake!  I've got to get it right,

and it's not right yet!  We need to

test this.

BEN

I spent my whole life protecting you,

from the schoolyard to the stars.  For

what?  So you could play Twister with

your girlfriend while I'm the freak of

the week?

SUE

Ben!  Stop it!  Or I'll stop it.

BEN

Stay out of this Susie.

BEN (CONT'D)

Good thing you're flexible enough to

watch your own back.  'Cause you're on

your own now.

REED

I'm OK.  Just go, go after him.  Stop

him.

JOHNNY

Christmas come early!  Check it out!

BEN ACTION FIGURE

IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!

JOHNNY

Hey!  That's a prototype!

BEN

Go back to the drawing board.

SUE

Johnny?  Did you see Ben?

JOHNNY

Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm

done with this freak show.  I'm moving

back to the real world.

SUE

Is that what you call it?  "Real"?

JOHNNY

At least it beats living in a lab like

somebody's science project.

SUE

Johnny, slow down.  Think.  You know

mom didn't raise us to --

JOHNNY

Look around, sis!  She's not here.  So

you can stop talking to me like I'm

your little boy --

SUE

As soon as you stop acting like one.

Come on, you're smarter than this.

You think those people out there care

about you?  You're just a fad to them.

JOHNNY

Let's try something new: you live

your life.  And I'll live mine.

(beat)

And just for the record: they LOVE

me.

SUE

Oh god, Reed.

SUE

What did you do, Reed?  What did you

do?

REED

I can...make it work.

SUE

Reed, stop, you need to rest your --

REED

The power...I need...more power...to

control...the storm --

SUE

You need a doctor.

VICTOR

More power...?

VICTOR (TO PHONE) (CONT'D)

Leonard.  Bring me our lab rat.

LEONARD

Ben!  They need you back at the Baxter

building.  It's...Reed.

JOHNNY

What do you say we get out of here?

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

This your boyfriend?

BOYFRIEND

Is that all you do?  Bar tricks and

stealing chicks...

GIRLFRIEND

What are you doing?!  You could have

burned somebody!

GIRLFRIEND (CONT'D)

You know, if I had your power I'd be

doing something with it, not wasting

my time doing cheap bar tricks,

hitting on some other guy's girl.

VICTOR

Ben, come in.

BEN

What is this?  Where's Reed?

VICTOR

Where do you think?  With Sue.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

(quiet)

I'll take it from here, Leonard.

LEONARD

Yes sir.

BEN

What do you want, Vic?

VICTOR

To help you.  I've run every test

known to man.  And they all yield the

same result: the machine is ready.

BEN

Reed said it'd be weeks till --

VICTOR

He also said we'd avoid that storm in

space.  And we know how that turned

out.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

He couldn't generate enough power for

the machine to reach critical mass.

Yet another mistake for "Mr.

Fantastic."

BEN

And you can?  Power it up?

VICTOR

Yes.  I've found a new energy source.

VICTOR (CONT'D)

Tell me...do you want to be Ben Grimm

again?

BEN

Let's do it.

BEN

Oh my God... Th-thank you.  THANK

YOU...VIC?!

BEN (CONT'D)

Vic... What the...?

DOOM

Everyone thought I was safe behind

those shields...

BEN

Victor, the machine worked for me.  It

can work for you --

DOOM

It did, Ben.  It worked perfectly.

BEN

You planned this...?

DOOM

I've always wanted power.  Now I've

got an unlimited supply...

BEN

And no Thing to stand in your way.

DOOM

Take a good look, Ben.  This is what a

man looks like who embraces his

destiny.

DOOM (CONT'D)

One down, three to go.

DOOM (CONT'D)

Right on cue.

REED

Oh god Ben.  Are you okay?

(amazed)

You did it, you really did it...

DOOM

No, Reed.  I did.

REED

Victor...?  What, what happened to

you?  What did you do to your --

DOOM

Exactly what I said I would: I built a

better, stronger being.  And

outsmarted the great Reed Richards --

REED

Victor, this isn't the way to --

DOOM

(a dark smile)

You always know best.  So tell me.

What happens when you superheat

rubber?

O'HOOLIHAN

Mr. Von Doom?  Are you oka--

DOOM

Never better, Jimmy.  And it's Doctor

Doom now.

DOOM

Why the long face?

SUE

Ben?!

JOHNNY (O.S.)

Sue!

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --

SUE

No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.

JOHNNY

Jesus, Ben!

(eyeing him)

I go away, look what happens.  You got

a lot of explaining to do.

BEN

(struggling, weak)

The machine works.  And Vic's gone

Mister Hyde on us --

JOHNNY

Really?  With a name like Von Doom?

Never saw that one coming.

SUE

Where is Reed?

BEN

Victor must've taken him.

DOOM

Chemistry 101, Part Two.  What

happens to rubber when it's super-

cooled?

DOOM (CONT'D)

Allow me.

DOOM (CONT'D)

Painful...?

DOOM (CONT'D)

You don't know the meaning of the

word.

DOOM (CONT'D)

But you will.

DOOM (CONT'D)

Flame off.

JOHNNY

Great.  Heat-seeker.

SUE

What are you doing --

JOHNNY

Sis.  Let me take care of you for

once.

SUE

But Johnny...you can't fly.

JOHNNY

Well then this'll be one hell of a

basejump.

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

(under breath)

Come on...come on...come on...

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

FLAME ON.

BEN

We need to help Reed --

SUE

Ben, you got what we all wanted.

You need to stay here.  It's too

dangerous.

BEN

What...what have I done?

SUE

What has he done to you?

DOOM (O.S.)

How romantic.

SUE

Victor, please --

DOOM

It's Doctor Doom to you.

SUE

We know the machine works.  It worked

on Ben, it'll work on you.  We can

turn you back --

DOOM

Do you really think fate turned us

into gods so we could refuse these

gifts?

SUE

Victor.  You always thought you were

god.

DOOM

Sue please, let's not fight.

SUE

No, Victor... Let's.

DOOM

Susan...... You're fired.

DOOM (CONT'D)

Marco...

DOOM (CONT'D)

Polo.

DOOM

One more down.  Now it's just the

scientist and his specimen.

REED

Sue.  The only thing I ever knew

without thinking was...

(his lips fully freezing)

I...love...

SUE

Me too, Reed.

DOOM

(quiet, cruel)

And so four became none.  It's my time

now.

VOICE (O.S.)

Actually, Vic...

BEN

IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!

BEN (CONT'D)

Damn, I've been wanting to do that.

BEN (CONT'D)

(Reed's words)

Victor's "not that bad," huh?  Just "a

little larger than life"?  Maybe

you'll listen to me next time before --

BEN

Excuse me, Maam.  Can I borrow your

car?

OLD LADY

The clutch sticks a little.

BEN

Not gonna be a problem.

VOICE (O.S.)

I can't let you do that.

DOOM

And you can't stop me.

DOOM (CONT'D)

Hello Susan.

DOOM (CONT'D)

What is this?  The pitiful three?

VOICE (O.S.)

Four.

JOHNNY

Had a little relapse, huh?

JOHNNY (CONT'D)

Welcome back.

DOOM

This is going to be fun.

REED

JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD!

SUE

Can't...hold...on...

REED

Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.

JOHNNY

But all these people...

REED

Now.

THING

(quiet, smiling)

Flame on, kid.

REED

Sue, I need some of that anger, rage,

frustration --

SUE

(looking at Doom)

I'm sure I can come up with something.

DOOM

Is that the best you can do...?  A

little heat...?

REED

Time for your lesson, Vic.  Chem 101:

what happens when you supercool hot

metal...?

(to Ben)

Ben...

BEN

Got it, teach.

DOOM

No.

JOHNNY

Damn, I love this job.

BEN

Job, huh...?

REED

Well, we do have the suits...

SUE

You know, about what we said up there,

I think maybe --

BEN

Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

SUE

Hilarious.

JOHNNY (O.S.)

Dude, that's still my sister.

REED

Ben, I've been crunching the numbers

on the machine.  I think if we can

rework the power settings...

BEN

Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.

ALICIA (O.S.)

That's my Benny.

ALICIA (CONT'D)

We're going to have to work on your

touch.

BEN

I like the sound of that.

REED

Sue, can I talk to you for a second?

REED

I found a broken gasket, from space --

SUE

A gasket?  Reed, we're at a party.

REED

If one of us were to wear it...

SUE

Reed.  What are you doing?

REED

No more thinking, no more variables...

Sue Storm...will you...

(she's gone)

Sue?  Sue?  You there?

SUE (V.O.)

Yes.

SUE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

That's my nose, genius... These are my

lips.

BEN

No more cracks about how I look.

JOHNNY

Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.

(weaving around bodies)

Clear the way, wide load coming

through.

BEN

Showoff.

FADE OUT.

THE END
