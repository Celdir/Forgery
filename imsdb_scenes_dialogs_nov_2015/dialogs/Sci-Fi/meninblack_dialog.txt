Men In Black

by

Ed Solomon

DRIVER

Goddamn bugs.

DRIVER (CONT'D)

Deja me hablar.

(Let me do the talking.)

AGENT JANUS

Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where

you comin' from?

DRIVER

I was fishing in Cuernavaca.

AGENT JANUS

Sure you were. What do you say we have a

look at your catch?

AGENT JANUS

Me, I woulda thrown 'em back.

(to the passengers, in Spanish)

Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina!

(Let's go. Out. Form a line!)

AGENT JANUS (CONT'D)

What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a

head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all

for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna

need --

KAY

We'll take it from here.

AGENT JANUS

Who the hell are you?

KAY

INS Division 6.

AGENT JANUS

Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.

KAY

Really?

KAY (CONT'D)

What're we thinking, Dee?

DEE

Tough call, Kay.

KAY

!Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey!

(What's up, how are you?)

No se preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los

Estados Unidos.

(Don't worry grandma.

Welcome to the United

States.)

(next)

A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo,

no? Buena suerta.

(Where are you going? San

Antonio?  Looking for

work, aren't you?  Good

luck.)

(next)

Es un placer verle aqui.

(It's a pleasure seeing

you here.)

KAY (CONT'D)

Que dices si te rompo la cara?

(What do you say if I

break your face?)

KAY (CONT'D)

No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol,

verdad, amigo?

(You don't speak a word

of Spanish, right, friend?)

KAY (CONT'D)

We got a winner.

(to the others)

Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense!

(The rest of you are free

to go. Scram!)

AGENT JANUS

Sir!

KAY

Tomen el camion, y vayeuse.

(Get on the road and go.)

AGENT JANUS

Sir, you can't just --

KAY

Don't "Sir" me! You have no idea who you're

dealing with!

KAY (CONT'D)

(to Janus)

We're gonna have a little chat with our

friend here. You boys can hit the road ...

and keep on protecting us from dangerous

aliens.

AGENT JANUS

You ever heard of Division 6?

2ND INS AGENT

There is no Division 6.

3RD INS AGENT

Who are those guys?

KAY

I think you jumped off the bus in the wrong

part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet

dollars to pesos that you're not --

KAY (CONT'D)

-- from anywhere near here.

KAY (CONT'D)

Mikey?! When did they let you out of jail?

KAY (CONT'D)

Political refugee. Right.

DEE

You know how many treaty articles you've

just violated?

KAY

One, my ass. Try seven.

DEE

From unauthorized immigration to failure to

properly inoculate prior to landing.

KAY

(off Mikey's objections)

Okay, that's enough. Hand me your head and

put up your arms.

KAY (CONT'D)

Ah, shit.

KAY (CONT'D)

Dee! Shoot him!

KAY (CONT'D)

Dee, for Christ's --

AGENT JANUS

Th -- th -- th --

KAY

(helping)

"That."

AGENT JANUS

That wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --

KAY

Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on

you.

KAY

Okay, everybody, situation's under control,

calm down. If you'll just give me your

attention for a moment I'll tell you what

happened.

KAY (CONT'D)

This is called a "neuralyzer." A gift from

some friends from out of town. The red eye

here isolates and measures the electronic

impulses in your brain. More specifically,

the ones for memory.

KAY (CONT'D)

Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;

holes at 40, 60, and 80.

2ND INS AGENT

What in the hell is going on?!

KAY

Exactly the right question. And the answer

lies right -- here. Pay attention.

JANUS

Who are you, really?

KAY

Really? I'm just a figment of your

imagination.

KAY (CONT'D)

God, we're a gullible breed.

KAY (CONT'D)

I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be

alive after a blast like that.

AGENT JANUS

What -- blast?

KAY

Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need

to exercise more caution before discharging

your firearms.

KAY (CONT'D)

Especially you.

DEE

I'm sorry. About...back there.

KAY

Happens.

DEE

Didn't used to.

DEE (CONT'D)

The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of

me...

DEE (CONT'D)

They're beautiful, aren't they?

KAY

What?

DEE

The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore.

(back to Kay)

I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase.

KAY

No. You won't.

EDWARDS

Stop! NYPD!

COP

All yours, Edwards!

EDWARDS

Grand Central Station off to your left,

folks...

EDWARDS

Dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my

gear!

EDWARDS

Yo, man, your luck just ran out.

PERP

He's coming! He's coming!

EDWARDS

And when he gets here, I'll kick his ass

too.

EDWARDS

What the...

EDWARDS

Wassup?

PERP

He's coming! He's coming because I failed,

and now he'll kill me too!

EDWARDS

Stop!

PERP

You don't understand. Your world is gonna

end.

EDWARDS

What are you?!

CUT TO:

INSPECTOR

Perpetrator then blinked two sets of

eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?

EDWARDS

No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then

again with another completely different set.

SERGEANT

Sort of a low beam, high beam.

INSPECTOR

Was that before or after he drew the weapon

which you claim evaporated into a million

pieces?

EDWARDS

After, sir.

INSPECTOR

And why do you suppose none of the other

officers saw either of these two events?

EDWARDS

'Cause some of the other officers are a

little soggy in the midsection. And they

couldn't keep up, sir.

SERGEANT

Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I

am --

EDWARDS

What do you mean? I am half the man you are.

SERGEANT

What the hell is your problem?

EDWARDS

My problem is you being all up in my damn

face all the time.

SERGEANT

I think he threw him off the roof. Ten

minutes -- your best shot.

INSPECTOR

(cutting off the Sergeant)

Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside.

Now.

EDWARDS

You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you

pudgy bastard.

LAUREL

Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I

believe you. I opened him up. Find me at

the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I

found.

EDWARDS

Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

LAUREL

(turning at the door)

You have really pretty eyes.

VOICE (O.S.)

Dr. Weaver, from the coroner's office?

Working on the John Doe?

LAUREL

Yes. That's right.

VOICE (O.S.)

Would you look right here, please.

LAUREL (O.S.)

Look where?

KAY

Some night, huh?

EDWARDS

Oh, yeah, some night.

KAY

They were gills.

KAY

Not eyelids.

EDWARDS

Who are you?

KAY

Did he say anything to you?

EDWARDS

(scoffing)

Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to

an end.

KAY

Did he say when?

EDWARDS

You're kidding, right?

KAY

Would you recognize his weapon if you saw

it again?

EDWARDS

Absolutely.

KAY

Let's take a ride.

EDWARDS

Wait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.

KAY

It's all done.

INSPECTOR

Good work, Edwards.

KAY

You ran that guy down on foot? That's tough.

That's double tough.

CUT TO:

EDWARDS

So who you with?

EDWARDS (CONT'D)

You got the plain clothes, the

government-issued wheels. Secret Service?

CIA?

EDWARDS (CONT'D)

(referring to the car)

Yeah, well, whoever it is, you're short on

funding.

KAY

Nothing is what it seems, kid.

EDWARDS

Oh, yeah, my bad '86 Ford LTD. That's a

luxury ride. C'mon, who ya with?

KAY

I'm part of a secret organization that

monitors and polices alien activity on earth.

EDWARDS

This is where we're going?

EDWARDS (CONT'D)

Jack Jeebs? Guy buys from chain snatchers.

Doesn't even sell guns.

KAY

Really?

EDWARDS

All right, you think it's worth shaking him

up, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some

answers.

KAY

Do your "thing," kid.  Edwards goes inside.

JEEBS

Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these

get here? I thought I turned 'em in to the

proper authorities.

EDWARDS

Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a

little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.

JEEBS

Sure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just

work here because I love the hours.

EDWARDS

(getting angry)

I'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech

stuff.

JEEBS

C'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.

KAY (O.S.)

Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs.

JEEBS

H-hiya Kay, how are you?

KAY

The imports, Jeebs. Now.

JEEBS

You know I got outta that business a long

time ago, Kay.

KAY

Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you

lie.

JEEBS

Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...

KAY

I'm going to count to three.

EDWARDS

He'll do it, Jeebs.

KAY

One.

EDWARDS

I've seen him do it.

KAY

Two.

EDWARDS

Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's

like this.

JEEBS

He's always crazy.

(to Kay)

Take a cruise. Get a massage --

KAY

Three.

EDWARDS

Put down the gun and put your hands on the

counter!

KAY

I warned him.

EDWARDS

Drop the weapon!

KAY

You warned him.

EDWARDS

You are under arrest. You have the right to

remain silent.

KAY

Will you relax?

JEEBS (O.S.)

(irritated)

Don't do that.

JEEBS (CONT'D)

Do you know how much that hurts?

KAY

Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up

another one.

KAY

Edwards?

EDWARDS

Uh, this. This is what I saw.

KAY

You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity

to an unlicensed cephlapoid.

JEEBS

He looked all right to me.

KAY

A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs.

Who was the target?

JEEBS

I don't know.

KAY

Jeebs!

JEEBS

I don't know!

KAY

This is all confiscated. All of it. I want

you on the next transport off this rock. Or

I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.

EDWARDS

Yeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.

EDWARDS

The eyelids, fine ... and the jumping thing

... and the gun ... okay, but the head?

KAY

Searching for a handle on the moment here?

A place to file all this.

EDWARDS

See a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just

grow back.

(looking up)

What's going on?

KAY

Can't help you, kid. Only comfort I can

offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember

a thing.

EDWARDS

Oh, no. This I'm gonna remember for a long,

long time.

KAY

Ever see one of these?

CUT TO:

KAY

(finishing a joke)

-- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know,

but this one's eating my popcorn!

EDWARDS

Huh?

KAY

Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.

EDWARDS

Where am I?

KAY

See what I mean about tequila? You're a

bright young man, James. Just lay off the

sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m.

sharp.

WAITRESS

Another beer?

EDWARDS

Coffee. Please.

MIB

CUT TO:

EDGAR (O.S.)

I go out, I work my butt off to make a

living, all I want is to come home to a

nice clean house with a nice fat steak on

the table, but instead I get this -- this

-- I don't even know what you call this!

EDGAR (O.S.)

I'll tell you what it looks like, it looks

like poison. Don't you take that away, I'm

eating that, damn it! It is poison, isn't

it?!

EDGAR (O.S.)

I swear to God, I would not be surprised if

it was, the way you skulk around here like

a dog been hit too much -- or ain't been

hit enough, I can't make up my mind.

EDGAR (O.S.)

You're useless, Beatrice! The only thing

that pulls its weight around here is my

goddamn truck!

EDGAR (O.S.)

Stay here!

EDGAR

Figures.

BEATRICE

What is it, Edgar?!

EDGAR

(turns to her)

Get your big butt back in that house!

VOICE (O.S.)

Place projectile weapon on ground.

EDGAR

You can have my gun when you pry it from my

cold, dead fingers!

VOICE (O.S.)

Your proposal is acceptable.

CUT TO:

BEATRICE

What on earth was it?!

EDGAR

Sugar.

BEATRICE

I've never seen sugar do that.

EDGAR

Give me sugar.

EDGAR (CONT'D)

In water.

EDGAR (CONT'D)

More.

BEATRICE

Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just

hanging off your bones!

EDGAR

That better?

CUT TO:

"504 Battery Drive."

GUARD

Help you?

EDWARDS

Maybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --

GUARD

Elevator. Push the "call" button.

ZED

You're late. Sit down.

ZED (CONT'D)

My name is Zed. You're all here because

you're the best of the best. Marines, Navy

SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.

ZED (CONT'D)

And we're looking for one of you. Just one.

What will follow is a series of simple

tests designed to quantify motor skills,

hand-eye coordination, concentration,

stamina -- I see we have a question.

EDWARDS

Why, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one

really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are

we doing this?

ZED

Son?

AMBITIOUS RECRUIT

(loud and formal)

Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with

honors. We're here because you're looking

for the best of the best of the best, sir!

ZED

What's so funny, Edwards?

EDWARDS

I -- I don't know, sir. This guy. "Best of

the best of the best of the best of the --"

(realizing nobody is with

him on this)

It just struck me as --

(totally serious)

Humorous. Sir.

ZED

Okay. Let's get going.

CUT TO:

EDWARDS

Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're

doing here?

MARINE

(clipped, unquestioning)

Looking for the best of the best of the best.

EDWARDS

(can't help but smile)

Well, yeah, I know, but...

ZED

The hell happened?

EDWARDS

Hesitated, sir.

ZED

May I ask why you felt little Tiffany

deserved to die?

EDWARDS

She was the only one who actually seemed

dangerous. At the time.

ZED

And how did you come to that conclusion?

EDWARDS

Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can

think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's

not his head. His head is that butt-ugly

bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you

look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not

snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues

in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow,

the girl's books were way too advanced for

an eight-year-old's. And besides, from

where I'm looking, she was the only one who

appeared to have a motive. And I don't

appreciate your jumping down my throat about

it.

EDWARDS (CONT'D)

Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology?

CUT TO:

ZED

He's got a real problem with authority.

KAY

So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed.

On foot. Tenacity. That I can use.

ZED

I hope you know what you're doing.

ZED (CONT'D)

Congratulations, you're everything we've

come to expect from years of government

training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we

have one more test to administer, an eye

exam.

EDWARDS

You! Hey, what's goin' on?

KAY

Back in the mid-fifties, the government

started a little underfunded agency with

the simple and laughable purpose of making

contact with a race not of this planet.

ZED

Now, if you'll look directly at the end of

this device.

KAY

Everybody thought the agency was a joke.

Except the aliens. They made contact on

March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.

KAY (CONT'D)

There were nine of us that night. Seven

agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor

kid who got lost on the wrong back road.

EDWARDS

You brought the aliens flowers?

KAY

They were intergalactic refugees with a

simple request. Let us use the earth as an

apolitical zone for people without a

planet.  Ever see "Casablanca?" Same thing,

no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all

evidence of their landing.

EDWARDS

The 1964 World's Fair was a coverup?

KAY

Why else would we hold it in Queens?

(another hallway)

Now left. More nonhumans arrive every year.

They live among us, in secret.

EDWARDS

I see. Not to change the subject, but when

was your last cat-scan?

KAY

Every six months; it's company policy.

EDWARDS

Well, thanks for the very amusing morning,

but I'm hopin' you'll show me where I came

in?  'Cause this is where I go out.

KAY

Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee

while we're right here.

KAY (CONT'D)

(to the aliens)

Don't tell me we've only got that powdered

shit for cream again?

KAY (CONT'D)

Oh.

KAY (CONT'D)

For future reference, this is a better look

for you.

CUT TO:

KAY

Any given time, around fifteen hundred

landed aliens are on the planet, the

majority right here in Manhattan. Most

aliens are decent enough, just trying to

make a living.

EDWARDS

Cab drivers?

KAY

Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the

most part, don't have a clue. Don't want

one, either. They're happy. They think

they've got a pretty good bead on things.

EDWARDS

Why the big secret? People are smart, they

can handle it.

KAY

A person is smart. People are dumb.

Everything they've ever "known" has been

proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago

everybody knew as a fact, that the earth

was the center of the universe. Five

hundred years ago, they knew it was flat.

Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans

were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know

tomorrow.

EDWARDS

So what's the catch?

KAY

What you'll gain in perspective, you'll

lose in ways you're too young to comprehend.

You give up everything. Sever every human

contact. No one will know you exist. Ever.

EDWARDS

Nobody?

KAY

You're not even allowed a favorite shirt.

There.  That's the speech I never heard.

That's the choice I never got.

EDWARDS

Hold up. You track me down, put me through

those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying

to talk me out of it. I don't get it.

KAY

You got 'til sun-up.

EDWARDS

Is it worth it?

KAY

You find out, you let me know.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

ORKIN MAN

Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we?

Think we own the place?

ORKIN MAN (CONT'D)

Got a little eviction notice for you, boys.

VOICE (O.S.)

Just what exactly do you think you're doing?

ORKIN MAN

(shrugs)

Takin' care of your pest problem.

EDGAR

"Pest" problem? "Pest?"

ORKIN MAN

Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation.

EDGAR

You know, I have noticed an infestation

here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing

but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious

pond scum. So convinced of their own

superiority as they scurry about their

short, pointless lives.

ORKIN MAN

Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of

'em?

EDGAR

In the worst way.

CUT TO:

EDWARDS

One thing you gotta know right now.

EDWARDS

All right. I'm in because there's some

next-level shit going on around here, and

I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there

are a couple of things we need to get

straight. You chose me 'cause you recognize

the skills. So as of now you can cease with

all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or

"sport." Cool?

KAY

Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours,

KAY

As of this moment, they don't mean much.

PASSPORT OFFICER

Purpose of trip?

ARQUILLIAN

Diplomatic mission.

PASSPORT OFFICER

Duration of stay?

ARQUILLIAN

Lunch.

PASSPORT OFFICER

Carrying any fruits or vegetables?

KAY

Let's go. He's a little...grouchy.

KAY

A couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year

flight would get on anybody's nerves.

EDWARDS

What branch of the government do we report

to?

KAY

None. They started asking too many questions.

EDWARDS

So who pays for all this?

KAY

Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we

confiscated from our out-of-state visitors.

Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.

KAY

(picking something up)

Here. A new recording device to replace

CD's.  So now I gotta buy the White Album

again?

(something else)

This is amusing. Universal translator.

KAY (CONT'D)

We're not supposed to have it. I'll tell

you why.  Human thought is so primitive

it's considered an infectious disease.

Makes you proud, doesn't it?

EDWARDS

What's this?

KAY (CONT'D)

Don't touch that!

KAY (CONT'D)

Caused the '77 New York blackout. Practical

joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it

was funny as hell.

EDWARDS

Sorry!

KAY

Observation, the heart of our little

endeavor.

KAY (CONT'D)

This map shows the location of every

registered alien on earth at any given

time. Some of them we keep under constant

surveillance.

KAY (CONT'D)

Everyone on these screens is an alien. In

public -- normal. In private -- you'll get

the idea.

KAY (CONT'D)

Meet the twins.

EDWARDS

I gotta be honest about something.

KAY

It makes no sense?

EDWARDS

It makes perfect sense. When I was a third

grader in Philadelphia, they told me I was

crazy 'cause I swore that our teacher was

from, like, Venus or something.

KAY

Mrs. Edelson.

KAY

Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.

ZED

What's your jacket size, Edwards?

EDWARDS

Uh -- forty regular.

ZED

Then let's put it on.

EDWARDS

Put what on?

ZED

The last suit you'll ever wear.

CUT TO:

ZED (O.S.)

From now on, you'll dress only in attire

specially sanctioned by MIB Special

Services.

ZED (O.S.)

You'll conform to the identity we give you,

eat where we tell you, live where we tell

you, get approval for any expenditure over

a hundred dollars.

ZED (O.S.)

You will have no identifying marks of any

kind.  You will not stand out in any way.

ZED (O.S.)

Your entire image is carefully crafted to

leave no lasting memory whatsoever with

anyone you encounter.

ZED (O.S.)

You're a rumor, recognizable only as deja

vu and dismissed just as quickly. You don't

exist; you were never even born.

ZED (O.S.)

Anonymity is your name. Silence your native

tongue.

ZED (O.S.)

You are no longer part of "the system."

We're above the system. Over it. Beyond it.

ZED (O.S.)

We're "them." We're "they."

ZED (O.S.)

We are the Men in Black.

JAY

The difference between you and me?

JAY (CONT'D)

I make this look good.

CUT TO:

ZED

Okay, let's see.

(to one of the monitors)

Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of

Sinalee touching down in the forest outside

Portland tonight. I'm pulling you down from

Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet.

BEE

Humanoid?

ZED

You wish. Bring a sponge.

(going through memos)

What else -- everybody, we gotta keep

Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system,

he's scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat

wants to reveal himself on "Unsolved

Mysteries." Bee, make sure he doesn't.

ZED (CONT'D)

Red-letter from last night -- we had an

un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate

New York farm country. Keep your ears open

for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a

galactic kegger down here.

ZED

Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.

KAY

(to Jay)

Landed alien out of zone.

(to Zed)

Who is it?

ZED

Redgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan

but he's way out of town right now, stuck in

traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why

don't you take Jay? This is a good one for

him to warm up on.

JAY

Yo, wussup with Zed?

(imitating him)

"Go get em, tiger. We're not hosting an

intergalactic kegger..."

KAY

Zed was saving the world before you were

born, son. Show some respect.

JAY

We got the use of unlimited technology from

the entire universe and we cruise around in

this?

KAY

Seat belt.

JAY

You know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to

people. You could be a little kinder and

gentler.

KAY

Buckle up, please.

JAY

Now did that hurt?

KAY

Makin' fun of my ride...

KAY

Jay. The button?

JAY

Yeah?

KAY

Never push the button, Jay.

CUT TO:

KAY

License and registration, please.

KAY (CONT'D)

Other license and registration, please.

KAY (CONT'D)

Your resident card has you restricted to

the five boroughs only. Where do you think

you're going?

REDGICK

It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!

KAY

Oh God. How soon?

KAY (CONT'D)

Okay. All right. No big deal.

(to Jay)

You handle it.

JAY

Me?

KAY

Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.

REDGICK

Are you sure he knows what he's doing?

KAY

Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time.

C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask

you something.

JAY

Oh God! I see it I see it I see it!

KAY

Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th.

You were headed out of town.

REDGICK

Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone.

JAY

Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see

that?!

KAY

(still to Redgick)

So? Who you meeting?

REDGICK

Well, it's -- a ship.

KAY

Really? I didn't see a departure clearance

for today.

REDGICK

You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.

JAY

Guys -- guys --

KAY

Doin' fine, Ace.

(back to Redgick)

What kind of emergency? What's the rush to

get off the planet all of a sudden?

JAY

(choking to death)

Help?! HELP! Hello?!

REDGICK

We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.

Some of the -- new arrivals.

KAY

What new arrivals? This have anything to do

with the crasher from last night?

JAY

(Screaming)

Can you guys do this later?!

JAY (CONT'D)

Oh -- oh -- oh -- man.

KAY

Congratulations! It's a lizard.

JAY

(misty)

Hey, you know, it is sorta --

CUT TO:

KAY

Anything about that seem unusual to you?

JAY

Pick.

KAY

What kind of "new arrival" would scare

Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump

with a newborn?

(thinks)

Let's check the hot sheets.

JAY

These are the hot sheets?

KAY

Best damn investigative reporting on the

planet.  But hey, go ahead, read the New

York Times if you want. They get lucky

sometimes.

JAY

You're actually looking for tips in a

supermarket tabloid?

KAY

Not looking for. Found.

Farm wife says

"ALIEN STOLE MY HUSBAND'S SKIN!"

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

KAY

Not so fast. Walk up slow.

JAY

Why?

KAY

Part of the routine. Makes it look like

we're sizing up the situation. Gives her

time to get the wrong impression.

KAY (CONT'D)

Puts some fear into her. Makes things go

smoother.

BEATRICE

Can I help you gentlemen?

KAY

How do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent

Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a

few questions about your visitor.

BEATRICE

Are you here to make fun of me too?

KAY

No ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense

of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we

come in?

BEATRICE

Sure. Lemonade?

CUT TO:

BEATRICE

And they said to me, "If he was murdered,

how could he walk back in the house?" And I

must admit, I was a little stumped by that

one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him.

It was more like something else that was

wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.

JAY

Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an

alien...

BEATRICE

Sorry?

KAY

Go on.

BEATRICE

Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.

KAY

Did he say anything?

BEATRICE

Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I

remember.

KAY

Sugar water.

JAY

Did you taste her lemonade?

KAY

Ray Bans.

(pulling off Jay's

sunglasses)

Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the

flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a

UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was

trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted

the light from Venus --

JAY

Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you

give her a new one?

KAY

Standard issue neuralyzer.

JAY

And that's the best you can come up with?

KAY

On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar

ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at

your mother's for a few days and get over

it. Decide you're better off.

JAY

(butting in)

Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never

appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked

him out, and now that he's gone, you ought

to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a

decorator or something...

CUT TO:

JAY

(from up outside the hole)

Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those

memory things?

KAY

When you're ready.

(re: analyzer)

Please -- not green.

KAY (CONT'D)

Do you know what alien life form leaves a

green spectral trail?

JAY

Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the

question on Final Jeopardy last night.

KAY

(softly, into mic)

Zed, we have a bug.

JAY

I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess

that this is bad. Right?

KAY

Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They

consume, infest and destroy. They live off

the death and decay of other species.

JAY

So basically you have a racial problem with

all insect-based life forms?

KAY

Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach

five times smarter than Albert Einstein,

four times stronger than an ox, nine times

meaner than hell, strutting his stuff

around Manhattan Island in his brand new

Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?

JAY

What do we do?

KAY

With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.

CUT TO:

ROSENBERG

Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this

planet are terrible.

ARQUILLIAN

Your majesty, you are in grave danger.

ROSENBERG

Yeah, and they overcharge you every time.

ARQUILLIAN

Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off

the planet.

ROSENBERG

A bug? He must know why I'm here.

ARQUILLIAN

We think he does.

(noticing the ornate box

on the table)

Is that what I think it is?

ROSENBERG

No, just some diamonds for your children.

Do we have time to eat?

ARQUILLIAN

Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.

COOK

Table six is up!

ARQUILLIAN

To the continued reign of the Arquillian

Empire.

ROSENBERG

To the safety of the galaxy.

ROSENBERG

(in English again)

You can kill us both -- but you will not

find it.

EDGAR

You're right about one thing.

CUT TO:

COP

What am I supposed to do with the cat?

INSPECTOR

I don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let

family claim it.

CUT TO:

COP

Where do you want contestant number three?

LAUREL

By the wall, I guess.

(noticing)

What's with the cat?

COP

Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat.

Sign here.

LAUREL

What's the problem with the cat?

COP

Your problem.

LAUREL

Are you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up.

(of Rosenberg)

His is worse.

LAUREL (CONT'D)

Okey-dokey. Shall we?

LAUREL

Oh, my God.

CUT TO:

LAUREL

(into recorder)

...approximately 112 degrees at time of

autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a

post-mortem increase in body temperature.

Examiner attempted to verify result

rectally, only to find subject was, uh,

without rectum. Which can only be described

as...well...as really...

KAY (O.S.)

Weird? Dr. Leo Menville, Department of

Public Health. This is Dr. White.

LAUREL

Yeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm

going to need to see some ID.

LAUREL

(checking her watch)

You boys must not have much of a home life.

KAY

We watch the morgues very carefully. You've

got something unusual?

LAUREL

I'd say so -- triple homicide.

LAUREL (CONT'D)

The first corpse was perfectly normal,

except that he was broken in half, but when

I opened up the other two -- well, look.

LAUREL (CONT'D)

There's a skeletal structure at work here

unlike anything I've ever seen.

KAY

I'll have a look at this one. Dr. White,

why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the

other body?

LAUREL

This way, Doctor.

LAUREL (CONT'D)

This one's even stranger. I did a full

laparotomy. I started with the lesser

curvature of the stomach -- though, if you

want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal

junction.

JAY

I think, uh, we should start at the same

place you did.

LAUREL

All right.

JAY

Your cat?

LAUREL

Guess it is now. Came in with the bodies.

LAUREL (CONT'D)

Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won't

mind.

LAUREL (CONT'D)

You have very pretty eyes.

JAY

Thank-you, but is this really the time to

uh -- you know, come on to me?

LAUREL

Hey, just walking the dog.

(continuing)

Feel that? Where the piloric junction would

be?

JAY

Oh, yes. Exactly.

LAUREL

Now push that aside. Notice anything

strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?

JAY

Nope. All fine.

LAUREL

Doctor, they're all missing.

JAY

(quickly)

Well, of course they are. What I'm pointing

out is that there are no pieces of them

left. So they're intact, wherever they are.

That we can be sure of.

LAUREL

Have we met before? I have the strangest

feeling of deja vu.

JAY

You know, I was just going to ask you the

same thing.

LAUREL

Okay. You wanna know what I really think?

(re: Kay)

But don't tell that guy. He looks like he's

already under enough stress.

(then)

This body is not really a body, but it's

actually some sort of transport unit for

something else altogether. The question is:

what?

LAUREL

By the way, stop me if I'm freaking you out.

JAY

No, no...not at all.

LAUREL

You know what I like to do sometimes? When

it's really late?

JAY

(freaked out)

No...

JAY (CONT'D)

Excuse me.

KAY

What do you think?

JAY

(of Laurel)

Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the

Undead thing goin' on.

KAY

Of the body.

JAY

Great body.

KAY

The dead body?

JAY

Not a clue.

KAY

All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to

sound too dumb.

LAUREL

Dr. White.

LAUREL (CONT'D)

(louder)

Dr. White.

(still louder)

Dr. White.

LAUREL (CONT'D)

(shouting)

DR. WHITE!

KAY

You're up, Slugger.

LAUREL

Look at this.

JAY

What is that?

LAUREL

Far -- freaking -- out.

BALTIAN

Must -- to pre -- prevent --

(searching for the word)

-- contest? No...to prevent --

JAY

It's all right -- What are you trying to

say? Struggle?

LAUREL

War?

BALTIAN

(faltering)

Galaxy on -- or -- or -- Orion's --

(thinks)

What is word? Be...?

JAY

Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt?

JAY (CONT'D)

"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's

Belt?"  The hell does that mean?

(turns around)

Hey! Kay! I mean, Dr., uh, whatever, come

here!

LAUREL

"Doctor Whatever"? You're not with the

Department of Public Health, are you?

JAY

He's dead.

KAY

Rosenberg. Damn. Good man.

JAY

You knew him?

KAY

One of the few I actually liked. Exiled

High Prince.

LAUREL

I was right -- this is an alien life form,

and you're from some government agency who

wants to keep it under wraps...

JAY

He said "to prevent war, the galaxy is on

Orion's Belt."

LAUREL

... This make total sense. How else do you

explain New York? The other night I'm in a

cab, this guy...

KAY

He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt?

That makes no sense.

JAY

That's what he said.

(to the dazed Laurel)

Didn't he? Right after he --

(realizing)

Oh, for Christ's sake, you did the flashy

thing already.

LAUREL

(as if awakening)

Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, I'm afraid

I'm going to need to see some ID if you're

going to be in the morgue, okay?

KAY

Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go.

JAY

Stop that --

KAY

(to Laurel, ignoring Jay)

Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.

JAY

-- that thing probably gives you brain

cancer!

KAY

Never hurt her before.

JAY

"Never hurt her before"?! How many times

have you done the flashy thing to this poor

woman?!

KAY

(evasive)

Couple.

JAY

Aren't you worried about, you know, long

term damage?

KAY

(more evasive)

Little bit.

JAY

What the hell happened to make you such a

callous son of a bitch?

KAY

I took this job.

JAY

Hey, you never flashed me with that thing,

did you?

KAY

Nah.

JAY

Hey, Kay, I really think I should be in

charge of the flashy memory thing

department.

KAY

Not while I'm around, Slim.

JAY

Yeah, well you're a menace with that

thing...

KAY

(to an MIB Agent)

We've got two dead aliens in there, and a

deputy medical coroner in need of a new

memory.

CUT TO:

EDGAR

No. No, NO, NO, NOOOO!

CUT TO:

JAY

Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around

here?

ZED

The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time

-- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months --

you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a

psychotic episode.

ZED

Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of

stars in the northern sky...

(pointing)

and here's Orion's belt --

JAY

That's what the little guy was talking

about, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on

Orion's belt..."

ZED

There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The

belt is just these three stars; galaxies

are huge, made up of billions of stars.

(switches off the laser

pointer)

You heard wrong.

JAY

You're attracted to me, aren't you?

SUBJECT: ELIZABETH ANN RESTON

PRESENT LOCATION: RESIDENCE

553 FAIRFIELD AVE./TEMPE/AZ

JAY

Pretty lady...

JAY (CONT'D)

You were the guy with the flowers in the

photo, (the night the aliens arrived.)

(What, you were on your way to a dance or

something and you got lost? And she never

got those flowers, did she?]

JAY (CONT'D)

Grumpy Guy's story comes into focus. She

ever get married?

KAY

No.

SUBJECT LOST

JAY

Well, it's better to have loved and lost

than never to have --

KAY

Try it.

ZED (O.S.)

Kay.

KAY

(quietly, with dread)

They're leaving.

ZED

We've had twelve jumps in the last hour.

Redgick was just the beginning.

JAY

What do they know that we don't know?

KAY

Why do rats desert the ship?

(to the twins)

Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view

of Manhattan.

KAY (CONT'D)

Four hundred.

KAY (CONT'D)

Four thousand.

KAY (CONT'D)

That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.

JAY

And we've got a dead Arquillian prince.

KAY

Message coming in.

KAY (CONT'D)

Speak of the devil.

JAY

They sound pissed.

ZED

(to the twins)

Translate that and step on it!

(to Kay)

Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and

see what you can turn up.

ZED (CONT'D)

And Kay -- take a lot of fire power.

JAY

I like that.

KAY

Series four de-atomizer.

KAY (CONT'D)

Here. We call this the "Noisy Cricket."

JAY

You get a series four de-atomizer and I get

a "Noisy Cricket?!"

(looks at the gun)

I'm afraid I'm going to break it.

CUT TO:

EDGAR

That's my truck!

DRIVER

And make sure you tell them that at the

impound.

DRIVER (CONT'D)

I got worse.

JAY

Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the

jewels?

KAY

Someone who's not looking for jewels.

JAY

This guy had a serious crush on his cat.

JAY

Kay! GET DOWN!

JAY

The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck

from the picture! That's him!

KAY

(picking himself up)

Damn it.

KAY

We do not discharge our weapons in view of

the public.

JAY

Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's

an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up

the world if we don't...

KAY

There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or

a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic

plague about to wipe out life on this

planet, and the only thing that lets people

get on with their hopeful little lives is

that they don't know about it.

KAY

Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving

town. We've got his ship.

KAY

(into phone)

Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew

down here at McDougal, south of Houston.

ZED

Containment may be a moot point, my friend.

The exodus continues. It's like the party's

over and the last one to leave gets stuck

with the check.

ZED

You sorry little ingrates!

KAY (O.S.)

What about the Arquillians?

ZED

We've only translated a part of the message

so far: "Deliver the Galaxy."

KAY (O.S.)

No, they don't want much, do they?

ZED

Oh, it gets better... They're holding us

responsible.

MIB

DELIVER THE GALAXY.

ZED

Another contestant has entered the ring.

KAY

All right, kid. The Arquillians want the

galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We

need help. A professional. Someone with

years of experience in intergalactic

politics. I just hope the little prick

hasn't skipped town.

CUT TO:

EDGAR

Where do you keep your dead?

VENDOR

(thinks)

I don't have any dead.

EDGAR

Where?!

VENDOR

I don't know, the city morgue!

CUT TO:

JAY

Of course that guy's an alien. That's gotta

be the worst disguise I've ever seen.

FRANK THE PUG

You don't like it, you can kiss my furry

little butt.

KAY

You busy, Frank?

FRANK THE PUG

Sorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my

ride's leaving in --

KAY

Call the pound. We got a stray.

FRANK THE PUG

Hey! Get your paws off me!

JAY

The, uh...dog owes my friend some money.

KAY

(to Frank)

Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?

FRANK THE PUG

I know nothing.

KAY

Not a thing?

FRANK THE PUG

Stop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn't some

two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of

a galaxy. They thought he would be safe

here on earth.

KAY

And the bug had other plans.

FRANK THE PUG

The galaxy is the best source for subatomic

energy in the universe. If the bugs get

their slimy claws on it, kiss the

Arquillians goodbye.

JAY

Ask him about the belt.

KAY

(to Frank)

Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on

"Orion's belt." What's he talking about,

Frank?

FRANK THE PUG

Beats me.

JAY

(to a person passing by)

They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

FRANK THE PUG

The galaxy is here.

KAY

Here?

JAY

The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars

and planets? How's it here?

FRANK THE PUG

You humans, when're you gonna learn that

size doesn't matter? Just 'cause something's

important, doesn't mean it's not very, very

small.

KAY

How small?

FRANK THE PUG

Tiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be walked

before the flight.

KAY

(to Frank the Pug)

Get out of here.

(then to Jay)

The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.

JAY

Kay...

CUT TO:

LAUREL

Boy, when you want attention --

LAUREL (O.S)

"Orion." That's a pretty name.

LAUREL (CONT'D)

What's this?

LAUREL

Wow.

JAY

So two galaxies have been fighting for

years. And the only people who've been

benefiting are a race of creatures called

bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make

peace...and the bugs send this guy down to

make sure the fighting never stops.

KAY

By killing the emissaries, and stealing the

galaxy they've been fighting about.

JAY

And if we don't get it back before he

leaves the planet...we're history.

KAY

We're not even history. 'Cause history

implies there's someone around to remember

it.

TONY

Thank you for making sure the bell works.

TONY (CONT'D)

(to Edgar)

What's up, Farmer John?

EDGAR

A man came in here earlier. A dead man.

TONY

And this means what to me?

EDGAR

He was a very dear friend of mine. And I

believe he had an animal with him. A gift

I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to

me. I would like it back.

TONY

I'll need a picture ID, written proof of

ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of

kinship with --

TONY (CONT'D)

-- the deceased.

EDGAR

Don't -- do that.

TONY

Do what?

TONY (CONT'D)

Shit!

CUT TO:

JAY

I'll handle this one, you wait outside.

KAY

What the hell for?

JAY

Because all we have to do is walk in and

get a cat, it's not that hard. But if you

go in, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on

her and flash your brain ray in her face

and she's gonna end up with leukemia or

some shit. The woman's a doctor, she

doesn't need you erasing half her med

school classes. Take me five minutes.

KAY

Two minutes!

EDGAR

Where is the animal?!

LAUREL

I told you, I don't know, it ran under some

equipment! Over there.

EDGAR

Get it!

JAY (O.S.)

Hello? Anybody here?

JAY (O.S.)

Hello?

JAY

Uh, hi.

LAUREL

(oddly)

Hello.

JAY

(flashes a badge)

I'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth

precinct. They brought a cat in here with a

corpse the other day, might have said

"Orion" on the cat's name tag?

LAUREL

Yes. That's right.

JAY

Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a

witness in a murder case and I'm going to

need to take it with me.

LAUREL

I don't know where the cat is at the moment.

JAY

You don't?

LAUREL

No.

(lowers her voice to a

whisper)

Maybe you could take me with you instead.

JAY

Excuse me?

LAUREL

I said, maybe you could take me with you

instead.

JAY

Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

LAUREL

I'd really like to go with you. Now.

JAY

And, uh, why exactly is that?

LAUREL

I just do.

LAUREL

I have something I need to show you.

JAY

Now slow down, you don't have to hit the

gas like that.

LAUREL

You don't understand. You really need to

see this.

JAY

And I will. But we gotta get something

straight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not

some kind of macho trip, it's just the way

I'm used to doing things, okay?

LAUREL

Look, Stud, I don't know how many more

times I'm going to get to tell you this.

There's something --

LAUREL (CONT'D)

-- that you have to help me with.

KAY

Freeze it, Bug!

JAY

Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

LAUREL

(to Jay)

CHRIST, are you THICK!

JAY

How was I supposed to know!?!

LAUREL

What did I have to do, SING it for you!?!

JAY

Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken

prom date!

LAUREL

Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman

shows the slightest hint of sexual

independence, men just --

EDGAR

Everybody shut UP!

KAY

Let her go, Shit Eater.

EDGAR

Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that

kind of talk in my end of the universe, but

compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on

the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all

right?!

KAY

You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches

to your left and I'll solve all your

problems.

EDGAR

That's better. Now put down your weapons.

We're leaving.

EDGAR (CONT'D)

Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?

EDGAR (CONT'D)

Would you care to see the fly get even?

KAY

How far you think you'll get without your

ship? If that's what you call that hunk of

space crap we've got back at our office.

EDGAR

Put the weapons down!

KAY

Never gonna happen, Insect.

JAY

It's okay, Laurel!

LAUREL

HOW is it okay?!

JAY

I mean it's going to be okay!

EDGAR

Don't bet on it, meat sack.

KAY

Damn it!

EDGAR

Take me here.

LAUREL

What???

JAY

They're in a cab.

JAY

Hey! Laurel!? Hey!

KAY

Stop wasting time. He's not getting off the

planet in a cab.

CUT TO:

KAY

(to tech at a desk)

Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way

around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's

not leaving the island.

KAY (CONT'D)

What've we got from our friends upstairs?

ZED

Same thing: "Deliver the galaxy."

KAY

Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but

we've got his ship. He's got to be looking

for a way out.

JAY

WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?!

ZED

Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get

an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we

have a galactic standard week to respond.

JAY

A galactic standard week? How the hell long

is that?

KAY

One hour.

JAY

One hour?

MIB

DELIVER THE GALAXY

OR THE EARTH WILL BE DESTROYED...

SORRY

ZED

To keep the bugs from getting it, the

Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and

whatever planet it's on.

JAY

You're talking about US!

ZED

Sucks, doesn't it?

KAY

Pull up the locations of all land-based

interstellar vehicles.

ZED

They're all gone. Frank the Pug took the

last ship on the planet.

KAY

Atlantic City?

ZED

Gone.

KAY

That landfill on the Jersey Shore?

ZED

Gone.

JAY

Uh, gentlemen.

KAY

Epcot?

ZED

Gone.

KAY

Miami Beach?

ZED

Gone.

JAY

Fellas.

KAY

Hartford?

ZED

Gone, thank God.

JAY

Hey. Old guys.

JAY (CONT'D)

Do those still work?

DISSOLVE TO:

EDGAR

You're coming with me.

LAUREL

What?! Why?!

EDGAR

It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

CUT TO:

RAIN LIKELY -- TEMPS DROP TO 60'S

CUT TO:

KAY

Whaddya say we bag us some bug?

JAY

You're taking the tunnel?!

KAY

You know a better way to Queens?

JAY

It's usually jammed?!

JAY

I told you!

KAY

Jay. The button?

JAY

Yeah?!

KAY

Push the button, Jay.

KAY (CONT'D)

And you may want to throw on a seat belt.

KAY

Mind if I smoke?

JAY

What?!?

KAY

In the car, I mean.

JAY

I don't care!!

KAY

Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers

some people if you smoke in a car.

KAY

Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke

anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I

should quit. I've tried. Never took,

though. I'm beginning to think I lack

self-control.

KAY

Well, back to work.

CUT TO:

LAUREL

Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat

me. I'm a very important person on my

planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even.

There are those who worship me, yes. I'm

not trying to impress you with this, I'm

just letting you know. It could start a

war.

EDGAR

Good. War means food for my family, all

seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot

of mouths to feed, your highness.

LAUREL

You're a wonderful dad.

JAY

You know how to work that?

KAY

No idea whatsoever.

KAY (CONT'D)

Let's bag us some bug.

JAY

Oh, shit.

KAY

Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic

implosion factor --

JAY

What?

KAY

Press the little green button, on three.

KAY (CONT'D)

One...two...

EDGAR

You don't get it. I've won. It's over.

KAY

You are under arrest for violating number

4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand

over any galaxy you might be carrying.

EDGAR

You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a

few seconds you won't even be matter!

KAY

Move away from the vehicle and put your

hands on your head.

EDGAR

Put my hands on my head?

BUG

Like this?

JAY

That did not go at all like I had planned.

KAY

This guy's really starting to bug me.

KAY

Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on

that ship.

JAY

Where are you going?

KAY

Getting my gun back.

JAY

What!?

KAY (CONT'D)

Hey, Bug!

KAY (CONT'D)

I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many

of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

KAY

You're just a smear on the sports page to

me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal

parasite! Eat me!

JAY

Hey! Come over here and try that!

JAY

Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on

your waxy, pointed ass!

JAY

What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand

and fight like an arthropod!

JAY (CONT'D)

You want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe

you're a badass in your hive, but this is

New York City. You're just another tourist

here!

JAY

You're messing with the wrong species, Bug --

JAY

Hey, Bug!

JAY (CONT'D)

If I'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of

yours.

JAY (CONT'D)

Whoa! That had to hurt. And, what d'you

know, here's your old Uncle Bob!

JAY

What's that? Can you hear what he's saying?

'Help me! Help me!'

JAY

Ooh! There's a pretty one. That one looks

kinda familiar, don't you think? I know who

that is!

BUG

Don't do that!

JAY

That's your Momma!

JAY (CONT'D)

Didn't she ever teach you not to bite off

more than you can chew?

JAY

You son of a --

KAY

Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We

have the galaxy.

ZED

I think the word's already out. Our friends

are coming back.

(then)

Got an authorized landing at Times Square.

You and Jay check it out on the way back...

And pick me up one of those soft pretzels,

while you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like

celebrating.

KAY

You were saying?

JAY

Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?

KAY

(shrugs)

Worked.

JAY

After I got the shit beat out of me!

KAY

And I almost got digested. It goes with the

job.

JAY

You coulda told me what you were doing.

KAY

There wasn't time, sport!

LAUREL

Interesting job you guys got.

DRIVER

Damn bugs.

CUT TO:

JAY

Look, I know we got rules, but she did just

bust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you

don't have to flashy thing her.

JAY

Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only

hangs out with dead people.

KAY

Not her. Me.

(looking up at the sky)

They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars.

I never just look anymore and they're

beautiful.

JAY

Kay, you're scaring your partner.

KAY

I haven't been training a partner -- I've

been training a replacement.

JAY

Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.

LAUREL

(walking towards them)

Hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment.

We're not even on the right island.

KAY

Maybe you won't have to.

KAY

Days. Months. Years. Always face it

forwards.

KAY

I've just been down the gullet of an

interstellar cockroach. That's one of a

hundred memories I don't want.

KAY

See you around, sport.

JAY

No, you won't.
