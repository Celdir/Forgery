MOON

November, 2007

Helium3 is a gas ejected from the surface of the sun and

blown through space by solar winds.

It plays an essential role in Cold Fusion, often toted as

the solution to humanity's future energy needs.

There is one major problem...

Helium3 is extremely scarce on Earth. The gas does,

however, exist in abundance on the Earth's only natural

satellite:

The Moon.

Should we turn to Cold Fusion in the future, it is

conceivable that man will mine the Moon for Helium3 and

bring the precious gas back to Earth...

2.

IN THE BLACK:

We hear something -- a machine -- CHURNING and POUNDING.

Constant. Rhythmic. Though the sound is slightly familiar,

we're not sure what it is yet. Hold for a few seconds and

then

CUT TO:

1   INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING                                      1

The sound belongs to a regular old TREADMILL like you see

in most gyms across the world. Running on it: SAM BELL, mid

thirties, thick beard, handsome, striking blue eyes.

Sam's face is flushed and glistening with sweat. He lunges

for a towel draped over the treadmill's bar, dabs his face

as he runs.

We see OUTSIDE THE WINDOW: A gray, powdery landscape

stretching beneath a BLACK SKY.

CUT TO:

2   EXT. MOON -- MORNING                                          2

Aerial view of the Earth's only natural satellite, the

camera roaming about a hundred feet off the surface.

Desolation. Serious, uncompromising, desolation. This place

makes Antarctica look like Tokyo.

And utter silence.

Eventually the camera arrives at a moon base, DIVING DOWN

towards it --

TITLE CARD: "MINING BASE SELENE. CREW: 1."

CUT TO:

3   INT. BATHROOM\SHOWER -- MORNING                               3

Sam takes a shower, treading in a tight circle beneath the

nozzle, eyes closed, hot water blasting his face.

3.

4   INT. COMMS ROOM                                               4

His hair still wet from the shower, Sam sits before a COMMS

UNIT, dressed in a "Lunar Industries" boiler suit, a zip up

the front, colorful patches sewn into the arms. He begins

to record a message.

SAM

Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you,

sweetheart? It's the morning

here. In a few minutes Gerty and

I will sit down for breakfast, go

over the day's itinerary.

As Sam continues his message, we are given a TOUR of the

mining base. Beginning with:

5   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       5

This is where you want to be if the shit hits the fan. The

base's equivalent of HQ. A wall of computers and flickering

digital displays.

SAM (V.O.)

Today begins my 154th week on

Selene. I officially have two

weeks to go before I climb into

that Return Vehicle...

6   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                           6

A small space craft attached to the base. It is essentially

a tiny room with a coffin like, sealed bed in the middle of

it: a cryogenic POD with an array of complicated controls

surrounding it.

SAM (V.O.)

And blast home.

7   INT. REC ROOM                                                 7

Sam spends most of his time here. It is kitchen and play

room combined. We PICK OUT a television set, an armchair, a

Ping-Pong table, the treadmill.

SAM (V.O.)

I never dreamed I'd make it this

far.

4.

SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

There were times, as you know...

SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...when I thought I was going to

crack up.

8    INT. GREENHOUSE                                               8

SAM (V.O.)

But I think I've come out the

other side now.

9    INT. INFIRMARY                                                9

SAM (V.O.)

In many ways, this place is all

about contradictions.

10   EXT. LUNAR LANDSCAPE                                          10

SAM (V.O.)

It's bleak, it's beautiful.

5.

SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It's barren, yet filled with

riches.

11   EXT. EARTH -- AS SEEN FROM THE MOON                         11

SAM (V.O.)

The earth is thousands and

thousands of miles away, but

sometimes looks so close I feel

like I could reach out and snatch

it with my hand.

12   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                      12

SAM (V.O.)

I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm

never alone...

SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Because I have you.

SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And I have Eve. I don't take you

guys for granted. You know that

now.

6.

13   INT. COMMS ROOM                                               13

SAM

Please kiss Eve for me. And tell

her daddy will only be away a

little longer -- seventeen days

longer, approximately. I love you

both dearly. Bye.

Morning, Gerty.

GERTY

Morning, Sam. How are you today?

SAM

Fine. Fine. You?

GERTY

I'm very well. How's your

headache?

7.

SAM

Much better, thanks, pal.

her in.

SAM

Sam Bell reporting to Central.

10:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1.

(less formal)

Overmeyers, Thompson? It's Sam.

How goes it? I've got a full

container of Helium3 ready to

roll. The purity is pretty good,

so assuming your last market

prices are still relevant I think

you are looking at getting about

3 million dollars per kilo with

this load. By the time this

message reaches you it should be

in transit.

(a beat)

Otherwise, everything running

smoothly. There was a discrepancy

between a couple of the N3000

modulators a couple of days ago,

but Gerty and I caught it in

time, no big deal. Uh...how are

things down there?

SAM (CONT'D)

Oh, and I just wanted to thank

you for sending out the football

feed. Almost felt live!

(getting pissed off)

Seriously, I don't mean to be an

asshole, but surely replacing one

satellite cant be that fucking

hard! I haven't been able to

have a conversation with my

wife... My kid can talk now...!

Fuck!

Two weeks. Two weeks.

(beat)

Hey. Three years is a long haul.

If you guys want to run some

psych evals on me when I get

back, I'm happy to do it. It

ain't Disney World up here.

(a beat)

That's it. Over and out.

GERTY

Sam, is everything okay?

SAM

Everything's fine, Gerty.

12.

SAM (CONT'D)

Why do you ask?

GERTY

You don't seem like yourself

today.

Sam frowns, contemplative. For a moment we think he is

going to tell Gerty about the Girl he saw earlier -- or

imagined he saw. But he goes with something different.

SAM

It's Tess.

GERTY

Has something happened?

SAM

No, not exactly.

Gerty stops cutting, lowers the scissors.

GERTY

Sam, what is it?

SAM

Something doesn't feel right,

that's all.

A beat. Sam's fingers twitching around the red stress ball,

squeezing harder.

GERTY

Sam, it might help to talk about

it.

Sam decides to come clean.

SAM

Tess isn't responding to things.

GERTY

Tess isn't responding to things?

SAM

Right.

GERTY

What kind of things?

SAM

(a beat)

A couple of weeks ago I asked her

if she wanted to go on vacation

when I get back, and that I was

thinking of either Mexico or

Hawaii.

(MORE)

13.

SAM (CONT'D)

Tess never said anything about

it. Three messages she's sent me

since...and she's never once

mentioned the vacation.

GERTY

Im sure she can't wait, Sam.

SAM

That's not the point. This is

someone who lives for vacations

and travelling. I thought she'd

jump at the chance for us to go

away -- with Eve, of course --

we'd take Eve.

GERTY

Perhaps Tess didn't receive the

message?

SAM

(as if anticipating

Gerty's comment)

But this isn't the only time it's

happened, Gerty. When I asked her

how her dad was doing on his new

heart medicine she didn't respond

to that -- I asked her when Eve

was going to start nursery --

nothing. Had her brother got the

position at the University?

Nothing. Nothing.

Sam is really having a go at the stress ball now.

GERTY

I think her brother did get the

position at the University. His

name is Christopher, correct?

SAM

He did?

GERTY

Yes, I seem to recall he got the

position. Professor of

Biochemistry, I think. At

Syracuse University in New York?

Sam is slightly alarmed that Gerty knows this and he

doesn't.

SAM

How do you know that?

14.

GERTY

You told me. Some time ago now.

Towards the beginning of your

time on Selene. When we were

starting to get to know each

other.

(a beat)

You were very happy for your

brother-in-law. You danced around

the Rec Room, if I remember

correctly.

Sam looks perturbed. For a few seconds he'd eased up on the

stress ball. He starts up on it again now.

SAM

Gerty, have you heard anything

new about anyone fixing lunar

sat?

GERTY

No Sam. From what I understand

it's fairly low on the companies

priority list with the Jupiter

mission active. I would imagine

it would be very expensive to

fix.

A pause. Sam still looks troubled.

GERTY (CONT'D)

Sam, are you ok?

SAM

They need to sort that out.

Seriously. I've only got two

weeks left. It's not fair on

whoever's up here next. Gerty,

you tell them to sort it out.

It's not healthy.

GERTY

I will Sam. Do you want me to

finish cutting your hair later?

SAM

Nah. Come on.   Let's finish

this.

Gerty resumes cutting Sam's hair, and stops again, sensing

Sam is going to say something more.

The scissors freeze.

15.

SAM (CONT'D)

I've got another one of those

headaches. Can you get me

something for it?

GERTY

Of course. Now?

SAM

No not now, afterwards.

SAM (CONT'D)

Thanks, pal.

OVERMEYERS

Delighted to hear about the

latest shipment, Sam.

THOMPSON

According to Albatross 90 it

should be landing off the

California Coast within the next

three days.

OVERMEYERS

Now in response to your question

about the communications

equipment, the news is not good.

THOMPSON

Sam, those solar storms did a lot

more damage than initially

thought --

OVERMEYERS

Fixing the lunar sat is going to

take some time. It's a

significant operation.

THOMPSON

And what with the Jupiter Program

hemorrhaging money --

OVERMEYERS

Lunar doesn't have the budget it

once did, Sam, you know that.

THOMPSON

Even the coffee machine down in

the Hub has been broken since I

don't know when --

17.

OVERMEYERS

We have to go to Genesis 3 just

to get a decent cup of coffee,

Sam. Genesis 3. That's three

buildings over.

THOMPSON

We're hoping to get the live feed

up and running by the Fall. The

good news is you'll be home by

then, Sam.

OVERMEYERS

You only have two weeks to go!

Hi Sam. It's me. How are you?

(a beat)

I got your last message, it was

really great to hear your voice.

I know you've been really lonely

up there, but in a lot of ways

it's been good for you, I think.

I hope you don't mind me saying

that. I'm proud of you.

(a beat)

Hey, someone's got something to

say.

TESS (CONT'D)

Eve, it's daddy. What did you

want to say to him?

Eve just stares. Tess whispers to her ("Remember what we

practiced", etc.) Finally Eve attempts:

EVE

Asstraut.

TESS

Who's an astronaut?

(encouraging)

Go on!

19.

EVE

Daddy asstraut!

TESS

That's right, daddy's an

astronaut. Clever girl!

TESS (CONT'D)

She's shy. Uh, Cathy, could

you...?

TESS (CONT'D)

It's her birthday next month. I

thought we'd get her a play house

for the garden. We could even

pick it out together.

TESS (CONT'D)

God, I hate these things. Sam, I

love you. I'm thinking of you

always. I can't wait to see you,

sweetheart. Okay. Bye.

on my hand.

GERTY

You saw something on the TV?

SAM

(a touch petulant)

Yeah, something on the TV

distracted me, Gerty, what's

wrong with that?

Sam, you said it was the TV that

distracted you, but when I came

in the TV wasn't on.

Sam, you suffered minor brain

slight logic impairment.

SAM

When can I get back to work?

GERTY

Central has asked me to slow down

the Harvesters to ensure you have

time to recuperate and get your

strength back --

SAM

Terrific.

GERTY

The good news is you can return

to the sleeping quarters

tomorrow. But it will still be a

few more days before you can

resume anything like a normal

work schedule.

There's no way to tell from here

if a track's been thrown, or if

it's just something jammed in an

axle, or what... I can shoot out

there, check it out, get some

video and maybe save you guys the

expense of floating in a whole

right now....

SAM (CONT'D)

Just give me the word -- or Gerty

the word, tell him to unlock the

get Matthew up and running again.

You're to stay put, understand?

OVERMEYERS

It's an order.

THOMPSON

It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

Stay put.

OVERMEYERS

We're going to send a Rescue Unit

to tend to the stalled harvester

and get the base back on its

feet.

I'm sorry Sam.

GERTY

What happened?

Don't know -- Micro meteorites,

better go outside and take a

look.

GERTY

There is no damage to the

exterior shell.

SAM

It's not that I don't believe

you, Gerty, but the inner skin is

springing leaks like an ACME fire

hose. Maybe you better let me

take a look, just in case, huh?

The Infirmary. You had an

accident out by one of the

I saw someone out there, Gerty.

GERTY

Who did you see, Sam?

SAM 1

I saw a girl.

GERTY

You saw a girl out by the

harvester? How is that possible?

Sam, you suffered a slight

incurred minor injuries, but all

Gerty?

Sam Bell.

You are Sam Bell.

Sam 2 slapping down cards. Sam 1 desperately attempts to

Why... What are you?

For a second we don't think Sam 2 is going to respond.

SAM 2

I'm a clone, Sam.    Im a fucking

clone.

About a week.

SAM 1

How are you getting on?

How am I getting on?

The company ordered Gerty to lock

all the exits. I haven't been

able to do anything for seven

days but sit on my ass.

They locked all the exits? What

about the harvesters?

SAM 2

Slowed them down to half speed,

apparently.

(MORE)

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

And then when I finally trick

Gerty into letting me outside I

find a clone of myself in a

Ok, Sam.   You're not a clone.

you. If it wasn't for you I'd

acting kind of weird lately,

though.

SAM 2

It's Fairfield, right?

There's Town Hall.

Uh-huh. You know Fairfield?

(also pointing)

That's the Baskin&Robbins. And

there's Tess and Eve. Do you know

Tess?

its tracks. Sam 2 immediately drops into deep melancholy.

Yes.   I know Tess.

Greetings, Sam!

THOMPSON

How's our Man? Feeling better?

OVERMEYERS

You getting lots of rest?

THOMPSON

Yeah, you resting up, Sam? You'd

better be you bastard.

OVERMEYERS

Enjoy it while it lasts! We've

got good news.

THOMPSON

The Jupiter Program had to be put

on hiatus, so we've got a few

free pairs of hands --

OVERMEYERS

We've managed to secure you a

Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.

THOMPSON

Rescue Unit Eliza.

47.

OVERMEYERS

They've been stationed on Goliath

19 for the last couple of months.

THOMPSON (O.S.)

Eliza's been in transit for the

last day....we expect them to

reach you in approximately 14

hours.

OVERMEYERS (O.S.)

Commence to jump for joy!

THOMPSON (O.S.)

You'll be back to work in no

time.

Now back on Overmeyers and Thompson.

OVERMEYERS

Eliza is bringing you something

special, Sam. Compliments of the

company.

THOMPSON

A hooker!

OVERMEYERS

No not a hooker. What's wrong

with you? It's a little something

to drink, Sam, that's all, our

way of patting you on the back

for all that you've been through.

THOMPSON

In the meantime, keep resting up,

and hang in there.

OVERMEYERS

Yeah you hang in there, Sam. Over

and out.

And the screen pops to black. A pause.

For a moment there is silence, neither of the Sams knowing

how to react -- going by the message Thompson and

Overmeyers don't know anything about there being two Sams

on the base now.

SAM 1

They're sending a Rescue Unit?

Why?

SAM 2

To fix the stalled harvester.

They didn't think I was up to it.

You're not going anywhere!

Sam 1 turns around, heads out of the room. Sam 2 STORMS

two to be woken up.

(indicating the model)

You said that thing had already

been started when you got here.

Well, who started it?

(then)

There might be other clones up

here right now. Think about it.

How did I get here so quickly

after your crash? They didn't

ship me in from Central, there

wasn't time. I must have come

from the base.

SAM 1

That's ridiculous. Impossible.

Why would hey do that?

SAM 2

I bet there's some kind of secret

room --

SAM 1

(laughing)

Secret room?

SAM 2

Yeah, secret room, why not?

SAM 1

(losing his cool)

You're the one who's lost the

plot! I've been here for three

years. I know every inch of this

base. I know how many dust fibres

are between those wall panels

over there -- why would they do

that?!

SAM 2

Look. It's a company, right?

They have investors, shareholders

-- shit like that. What's

cheaper? Spending time and money

training new personnel or just

have a couple of spares here to

do the job. If they make it

through their contract, great.

If they don't, hallelujah! No

contract completion fees, no

retirement package. Just thaw out

the spare, and keep the profits

rolling in. It's the far side of

the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's

haven't even fixed our

shit about us? They're laughing

Suddenly Sam 1 sees the GIRL in the mirror. It gives him a

The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral

expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers

the toilet paper from his nose.

SAM 1

Who are you?

GERTY

Sam, is everything okay?

54.

SAM 1

We had a fight. Me and the other

guy, the other Sam. We had a

fight, Gerty. He's a maniac. You

know what he did? He flipped the

entire model over. Do you know

how much work I've put into that

thing?

GERTY

938 hours.

Really? 938 hours.

GERTY

Approximately.

SAM 1

He scares me, Gerty.

What is it about Sam that scares

you?

SAM 1

He flies off the handle. I see it

now...I see what Tess was talking

about.

(a beat)

I've never told you this, Gerty,

but she left me. Tess left me.

For six months. She moved back in

with her parents.

GERTY

I know.

SAM 1

Oh...

It was the year before I came in

here. She gave me a second

chance. I promised her I'd

GERTY

You have changed, Sam.

SAM 1

Yeah, I guess I have.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

Gerty, since I've been up here

I've sent Tess over a hundred

video messages. Where did those

messages go? Did they ever reach

her?

A pause.

GERTY

Sam, I can only account for what

occurs on the base.

SAM 1

What about the messages she sent

to me?

A long pause. Finally Gerty repeats:

GERTY

Sam, I can only account for what

occurs on the base.

SAM 1

Gerty, am I really a clone?

GERTY

Sam, when you first arrived at

Selene, there was a small crash.

You woke up in the infirmary. You

suffered minor brain damage and

memory loss. I kept you under

observation and ran some tests.

SAM 1

I remember.

GERTY

Sam, there was no crash. You

were being awakened.

(a beat)

It is standard procedure for all

new clones to be given tests to

establish mental stability and

general physical health. Genetic

abnormalities and minor

duplication errors in the DNA can

have considerable impact--

SAM 1

And Tess?    Eve?

GERTY

They are memory implants, Sam.

I'm very sorry.

56.

Sam 1 nods at this. He's broken-hearted.   He begins to

leave.

No thanks, Gerty.

Eventually Sam 1 tentatively comes over.

You okay?

SAM 2

I'm staring into space.

Sam 1 does get it. He smiles to be polite, sits.

SAM 2

Listen, I went haywire before. I

lost it. I'm sorry.

It's okay.

SAM 2

No it's not okay. I fucked up

Fairfield -- your model -- that's

unacceptable. I don't know what's

wrong with me.

(then)

I've got a temper. I need to do

something about it.

SAM 1

Yes you do.

A pause.

SAM 2

I've been thinking. That Rescue

Unit -- Eliza -- they'll be here

in less than fourteen hours. I

don't know about you but I'd like

to figure out where we stand

before they get here.

SAM 1

Absolutely.

SAM 2

Ostensibly they're coming to deal

with the stalled harvester. We

both know that isn't true.

(then)

They're coming to dig your body

out of that rover. They think

you're in there.

SAM 1

Right.

SAM 2

What'll their reaction be when

they find out you survived the

crash? I wasn't supposed to find

you. Lunar instructed Gerty to

lock me inside the base for

Christ's sake.

A pause. Sam 1 thinking it over.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

And there's something else.

Something I haven't told you.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Right around the time I was

awakened...I walked in on Gerty

talking to Central. He was having

a live conversation.

SAM 1

A live conversation?

SAM 2

Yeah.

SAM 1

That's not possible.

SAM 2

No no no, it is possible. It's

possible because I saw it, that's

my point.

Sam 2 feels himself losing his temper a little here. He

reigns himself in.

SAM 1

How do you know the conversation

was live?

SAM 2

It was a back and forth exchange.

And I saw Thompson and Overmeyers

up on the monitor. I was supposed

to be asleep in the Infirmary.

The moment I walked into the

comms room Gerty terminated the

transmission. Now I was a little

drugged up, granted, but I didn't

imagine it.

SAM 1

The communications equipment is

damaged -- there was a solar

storm --

SAM 2

Tabitha.

SAM 1

Tabitha, right.

SAM 2

Lunar made it up. Maybe. I don't

know. Bottom line is they don't

want us to be able to contact

Earth. Otherwise why would they

have lied to us?

A pause. Sam 1 staring forward, concentrating. Sam 2

concentrating on Sam 1.

59.

SAM 1

How are they blocking the live

feed? The base's communications

equipment works fine --

SAM 2

Maybe they're not blocking the

signal from inside the base.

SAM 1

From where then?

As if reading each others minds, the two Sams' heads turn

to the window -- a slow, perfectly synchronized movement.

The lunar landscape, as black and vast as ever. The view

almost cruel in its emptiness. It's not giving them any

answers, not yet.

CUT TO:

103   I/E. ROVER ONE/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                            103

Sam 1 speeding along in one of the Rovers. He wears his

space suit and resembles a cosmic racing driver -- shifts

up a gear, the vehicle flirting with peak speed.

He flies past one of the Harvesters, speaks through a

microphone inside his helmet.

SAM 1

Just passing the last of the

Harvesters -- looks like John --

All of this against the ROAR of the Rover's engine.

104   I/E. ROVER TWO/MOON SURFACE                                   104

Driving away from base in a   different direction, Sam 2. He

also wears a space suit. He   also guns the engine. He also

has a microphone inside his   helmet. The two clones are able

to talk back and forth with   no delay.

SAM 2

How long until you're out of the

base's range?

We INTERCUT between the two Sams in their Rovers.

SAM 1

If I maintain this speed...a

minute. Ninety seconds tops.

SAM 2

You ever been this far out?

60.

SAM 1

No, never.

ANOTHER ANGLE -- SECOND ROVER

Viewed from far away, the Rover's speed less impressive

from a distance.

105   I/E. ROVER'S ONE AND TWO/MOON SURFACE -- INTERCUT           105

As the Sams continue to drive.

SAM 1

You see anything yet?

SAM 2

Nothing. You?

SAM 1

There isn't shit out here...I

feel like I'm about to drive off

the end of the world.

(then)

It would help if I knew what I

was looking for.

Through the glass of Sam 1's helmet we see his FACE

suddenly SHIFT.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

Wait a second, wait a second.

Sam 1 squints and leans closer towards the windshield, like

he's trying to decipher a road sign --

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

I see something.

SAM 1'S POV

About a hundred feet away -- appearing from thin air -- a

massive metal pole stretches up into the black sky.

SAM 2

What is it?

SAM 1

Don't know yet.

Sam 1 getting closer.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

Looks like some kind of antenna.

61.

SAM 2

Antenna? Really?

(then)

Hang on, looks like there's one

on this side too.

Sam 2 is indeed approaching something similar.

Sam 1 stops his Rover about twenty feet from the Jammer. He

opens the Rover's door and steps out to take a closer look.

WIDE SHOT -- SAM 1/ROVER

Taking in the Jammer and the adjacent Rover. Sam 1 loping

towards the Jammer, seemingly in slow motion.

The JAMMER is GIGANTIC --An intimidating, stark pole

stabbed into the lunar landscape, like the worlds biggest

caber. Next to it Sam 1 is tiny, a white dot, as

insignificant as a pin prick.

Sam 1 and Sam 2

We cut back and forth between the two Sams as they both

investigate the separate but identical-looking Jammers.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

I can just make out the top. Must

be a hundred feet tall at least.

It's huge!

SAM 1

Whoever built these things meant

business. They weren't fucking

around.

Their voices ENERGIZED -- they are excited to have made

this discovery -- they aren't dealing with the negatives

yet.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

What do you think?

SAM 2

Its not an antennae, dude. Its a

jammer.

(looking around)

No wonder we can't get a live

feed. These things must be

blocking our signal.

Suddenly Sam 1 doubles over. He vomits thick, viscous

blood and sick into his helmet. Revolting.

The noise is AUDIBLE over the microphone.

62.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

You okay?

No answer from Sam 1. He COLLAPSES backwards onto the

ground. His chest LURCHES like he's been punched at from

the inside -- he spins over onto his front --

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Sam?

Sam 1 manages to climb to his feet -- heads slowly back to

the Rover -- he dips in, closes the door.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Sam, can you hear me?

SAM 1

Yeah, I hear you.

(then)

I'm going to head back to base.

I'm not feeling too good.

SAM 2

I'll stay out here a little

longer. I want to see if there

are any more of these things.

Sam 1 pulls a U-turn and begins his journey back to base.

Sam 2 remains out by his Jammer, investigating further.

CUT TO:

106   I/E. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                             106

Sam 1 at the wheel. He has pulled his helmet off within

the safe pocket of the rovers cabin. He's a grizzly mess

of splashed sick and blood all over his face and chest.

Sam 1 screams out with confusion, frustration, terror.

SAM 1

Fuck!

He seizes the steering wheel, shakes it FIERCELY --

beginning to really LOSE IT --

107   INT. DOCK                                                   107

Sam 1 drives his Rover into the Dock -- not with his

customary precision -- parks at an angle, grazes the wall.

The Rover's door JERKS opens and Sam 1 steps out

unsteadily, his face visibly PALE through the glass of his

helmet.

63.

He STAGGERS across the dock -- doesn't even close the

Rover's door behind him -- heads into the corridor.

108   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 108

Sam 1 goes swerving up the corridor like a drunkard --

BANGING into walls -- he finally reaches the bathroom and

ducks in --

109   INT. BATHROOM                                                 109

Sam 1 sinks to his knees before the toilet bowl. With great

effort he is able to remove his helmet, placing it on the

floor next to him. He stares into the toilet.

For a moment all is calm. The gentle "ping-ping-ping" of a

computer somewhere inside the base. Sam breathing steadily.

Spots of sweat on his upper lip.

And then he VOMITS. He vomits LOUD, he vomits VIOLENTLY.

His whole body THRUSTS forward in the process, taught,

tense, like a dog being YANKED on a CHAIN.

Sam 1 vomits again. And again. And again. And stops.

ANGLE FROM ABOVE -- SAM 1

Sam 1's vomit is DARK RED -- he's thrown up BLOOD -- but

that's not all -- we can clearly see two or three TEETH

floating in the vomit --

THE MIRROR

Sam 1 stands, moves to the mirror, opening his mouth wide

to look for the missing teeth -- he uses his thumbs, shows

his gums -- revealing: yes, he's lost at least a couple of

teeth.

He flushes the toilet.

CUT TO:

110   EXT. MOON -- DAY                                              110

Sam 2 driving along in his Rover. He comes across another

one of these JAMMERS. He drives right up, ducks down,

peering up through the windshield -- this new Jammer is as

tall as the others, in fact, it is identical in every way.

How many of these things are there?

64.

Sam 2 circles the Jammer in the Rover, drives on.

CUT TO:

111   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       111

Sam 1 enters and sits down at The Old Man. Frantically he

starts typing in numbers.

An array of Log Entries appear ON THE SCREEN. Sam watches

one of them.

SAM 1

(on screen)

January 12th, Lunar hour 8:32.

All Harvesters running smoothly

today. Readouts are as follows:

Matthew, 12.7 miles; Mark 11.9

miles...

These are just his log entries. What's he looking for?

Sam 1 starts scrolling BACK through the log entries, like

he's REWINDING chapters on a DVD, showing himself at

various stages of his time on Selene -- his beard

essentially growing in REVERSE as the messages stretch

further back -- eventually Sam 1 is clean shaven --

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

(on the screen)

Luke, 12.9 miles; John, 11.1

miles...

Sam 1 keeps typing in numbers.

ON THE SCREEN: "RESTRICTED. PASSWORD REQUIRED."

No go.   He tries to hack his way in, but is having no luck.

One of Gerty's long spindly ARMS slides into the room. Sam

backs away from the intimidating piece of machinery, but it

stops within reach of the computer.

Sam 1 watches as the arm reaches forward and taps the

password in for him. It leaves the room the way it came

in.

Sam 1 continues to go further and further back -- and

suddenly he POPS up on the screen again -- or is it him? --

this Sam up on the screen has stubble -- no beard -- and

looks seriously ILL --

He is barely able to talk -- in fact he's SLURRING --

65.

SAM

(on screen)

...John, 15.1 miles...sorry, I'm

not feeling too hot today -- I'm

going to have to continue this

later --

The SEQUENCE becomes a FAST-PACED and NIGHTMARISH MONTAGE --

continuing to BACKTRACK through the log entries -- showing

yet more SAMS -- one has a MOUSTACHE -- one has a SHAVED

HEAD -- one has grown out his hair and has a PONY TAIL,

we've seen this particular Sam before in an earlier scene.

But all the Sams have one thing in common: towards the

latter end of their log entries they all appear to be in

very bad physical shape --

SAM 4

...I've got blood coming out of

my nose...

SAM 5

I don't feel too well, Old Man.

SAM 6

My hair's falling out...look it.

Sam 1 searches even DEEPER into the COMPUTER and uncovers

yet more footage.

We see the others Sams returning to Earth -- yet they don't

seem to go anywhere -- when they blast off the RETURN

VEHICLE remains in its bay --

Sam 1 views different Sams blasting back to earth in the

return vehicle -- always with the same result -- the return

vehicle remaining in its bay, the Sams seemingly VANISHING.

In one particularly GRAINY SEQUENCE Sam 1 views Gerty

opening the lid to the cryo pod in the return vehicle and

beginning to VACUUM what appears to be DUST or DEBRIS --

Sam 1 understands now that the Return Vehicle is not a

spacecraft, but some kind of INCINERATOR.

112   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                         112

Sam 1 heads into the Return Vehicle. Its dominated by the

cryo pod, used to hold astronauts in a state of cryogenic

sleep on their way back to Earth. Sam 1 pops open the lid

and starts frantically searching the chamber for TRACES of

the previous Sams, eventually finding particles of DUST in

the cracks --

66.

He closes the lid. A video showing a TECHNICIAN in a white

lab coat begins to play on a screen aimed at the glass lid

of the pod. It's mute, but we can hear a tinny version of

the audio coming from the cryo pod. Sam 1 pushes a button

on the monitor and we hear the audio properly.

TECHNICIAN

...relax and breathe deeply. The

cryo pod is designed to put you

into a deep sleep for the

duration of your three day return

journey back to Earth. As you

begin to get sleepy, think about

the magnificent job you've done,

and how proud your family are of

what you've accomplished.

Relaxing music begins to play. After a moment the music

stops. There is a pause. Then an almighty pulse of light

from the cryo pod. This is how Sams past have met their

end. Nuked to ash like microwave meals in the cryo pod.

Sam 1 inspects the controls of the spacecraft to see if it

really is a vehicle -- in the process of his search he

finds himself down on his knees checking out the wiring.

Suddenly Sam 1's attention is on the floor BENEATH HIM. He

appears to be kneeling on some kind of PANEL -- like a

tablet in the return vehicle's floor -- he presses his ear

against the panel -- KNOCKS --

The panel sounds HOLLOW.

CUBBY

Sam 1 opens a cubby, swipes something similar to a CROW

BAR, heads out of the frame --

RETURN VEHICLE

Back in the Return Vehicle, Sam 1 stands over the panel in

the floor. He uses the CROW BAR to prize the panel open --

this takes an extraordinary effort -- the panel eventually

LIFTING like a manhole cover.

Sam 1 can't believe his eyes. At the top of the OPEN PANEL,

leading down into darkness...there's A LADDER.

113   INT. DOCK                                                  113

Sam 2 returns from his tour of the perimeter of the base;

pulls up alongside Sam 1's Rover, having to compensate for

his clone's poor parking job.

67.

114   INT. CORRIDOR                                               114

Sam 2 exits the Parking Bay and removes his helmet. Down

the corridor he sees Sam 1 standing outside the Return

Vehicle: facing him, waiting.

SAM 2

I saw three more of those

jammers. The base is surrounded.

I printed out their coordinates --

Sam 2 begins to remove a piece of paper from his pocket,

but suddenly stops. He can tell by Sam 1's expression that

something has happened.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

What? What is it?

SAM 1

I found your secret room.

CUT TO:

115   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                         115

Standing over the Open Panel, an anxious Sam 1 and Sam 2

stare down.

SAM 2

Who goes first?

Sam 1 wordlessly takes the lead, crouching slightly to

seize the ladder and twist his body down into the hole. He

begins to DESCEND. When he is roughly half way down Sam 2

follows.

116   INT. LOWER DECK/CHAMBER -- CONTINUOUS                       116

Sam 1 reaches the bottom of the ladder. He's in a dark

room, a kind of CHAMBER -- if NASA did crypts, it would

look like this.

The only light source right now is the coming from the

Return Vehicle up above. Sam 2 hops down beside Sam 1,

squints into the darkness.

SAM 2

Is there a light?

Both Sams FUMBLE along opposing walls -- Sam 1 eventually

finding a SWITCH, snaps it on.

An array of overhead fluorescent bulbs begin to STUTTER and

FLASH before ILLUMINATING the chamber completely --

68.

The two Sams can hardly believe their eyes: stretching back

maybe fifty feet are rows and rows of PODS -- like upright

glass coffins -- and standing inside each pod, an as-of-yet

UNAWAKENED CLONE. It's like an ENTIRE ARMY of Sam Bells...

Spooky as hell.

For a few moments Sam 1 and 2 are too stunned to speak.

They walk to the end of the chamber and back again, looking

at each clone one at a time -- all the clones are bare

chested and wear some kind of white cloth to cover their

genitals, like a diaper.

Of course they all look the same, that's why they're

clones, but this piece of scientific wizardry is mind-

boggling to Sam 1 and 2 -- they MARVEL at how each of the

clones is identical in every way, and down to the minutest

of details -- same length of hair, same skin tone, same

fingernails --

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Why are there so many of them?

SAM 1

The cryo pod in the Return

Vehicle is an incinerator.

Sam 2 reacts with appropriate shock.

SAM 2

What?

SAM 1

We don't go home. We're burned to

death up there. Then the company

wakes up a new one. Every three

years. Like clock work.

Sam 2 absorbing this. Then:

SAM 2

How do you know all this?

SAM 1

(beat)

I hacked into the Old Man.

Actually, Gerty did. I saw

footage. You're right, there have

been other clones before us.

SAM 2

How many?

SAM 1

Enough.

A pause.

69.

SAM 2

If that Rescue Unit finds the two

of us awake at the same time,

they'll kill us both for sure.

Sam 1 doesn't respond, he's in his own world.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

What are we going to do?

All of a sudden Sam 1 makes a beeline for the ladder,

starts heading back up.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Where are you going?

117   INT. MONITORING STATION -- MOMENTS LATER                      117

Sam 1 is digging in drawers, removes some equipment, some

wires; a radio, a small machine called a VIDEO PHONE,

referred to as a VP.

He is watched by Gerty.

GERTY

Sam, can I help you with

something?

SAM 1

Not now, Gerty, okay?

Gerty begins to slide out of the room.   Sam calls after

him.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

Gerty? Why did you help me? With

the password? Doesn't that go

against your programming or

something?

GERTY

Helping you is what I do.

Gerty leaves.

Sam 1 goes on picking up equipment, shoves it all into a

backpack he swiped from a peg.

Now Sam 2 appears in the doorway.

SAM 2

What's going on?

SAM 1

There's something I've got to do.

70.

Sam 1 brushes by Sam 2 on his way out.

118   INT. DOCK                                                   118

Sam 1 marches up to his Rover, tosses in the backpack and

dips inside without his helmet, closes the door and backs

out into the black day.

119   I/E. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                             119

Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks

possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --

WIDE SHOT

Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now

know circle the perimeter of the base.

Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.

Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might

be able to get a signal through to Earth.

ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and

starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto

the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP

resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but

nonetheless high-quality screen.

Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters

some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He

is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,

so he is only sending audio.

A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.

SAM 1

Come on...come on...

Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems

to have gone through.

And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.

Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his

hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles

dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.

The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --

that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:

GIRL

Hello?

71.

That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to

respond:

SAM 1

Uh, Bell residence?

The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or

two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We

assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on

the Girl's end.

The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,

ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.

GIRL

This is the Bell Residence.

SAM 1

I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

The girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between

melancholy and curiosity --

GIRL

I'm sorry, she passed away some

years ago.

Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged

a paring knife into his belly.

SAM 1

No...no way.

The girl just stares.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

Tess Bell? Are you sure?

GIRL

Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her

daughter.

(then)

Can I help you?

And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes

a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new

revelation.

The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.

Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.

SAM 1

Eve?

Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.

72.

EVE BELL

Yes?

A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam

1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.

SAM 1

(overwhelmed)

Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you

now?

For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in, intrigued.

EVE BELL

I'm fifteen.

(then)

Do I know you?

SAM 1

How did mom die, sweetheart?

EVE BELL

Uh...

Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from

the screen and calls to someone in another room:

EVE BELL (CONT'D)

Dad!

And then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.

SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)

What!

EVE BELL

Dad, there's someone asking about

mom...

Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into

the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.

SAM'S VOICE

Who's asking about mom?

Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.

He sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of

nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --

Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.

73.

120   EXT. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                     120

The Rover viewed from outside. We can't hear a thing. Just

the endless and unrelenting MOON SILENCE.

Inside the Rover we are able to make out Sam 1, quivering

at the wheel as he sobs.

CUT TO:

121   INT. COMMS ROOM                                             121

CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN

The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm.

Appearing on The Old Man's monitor: "RESCUE UNIT ELIZA:

ARRIVAL TIME, 12 HOURS and 22 MINUTES."

CUT TO:

122   INT. REC ROOM -- DAY                                        122

Sam 2 is sitting before the model. He's flipped it back

over and returned it to the table top. Now he is attempting

to fix some of the demolished pieces. At this moment he's

gluing the spire back on the church.

Sam 2 hears a sound from the corridor. Moments later Sam 1

appears in the doorway wearing the backpack.

Sam 1 is beginning to look alarmingly ILL. His depleting

health has been evident throughout the film, but now it

seems to have jumped to a new level.

He watches Sam 2 for a little while.

SAM 1

Want me to help?

Sam 2 shifts over to give Sam 1 the adjacent chair. Sam 1

walks over, sits down. Together they work on gluing the

church back together.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

Remember that crazy drunk guy who

used to hang out by the church?

SAM 2

Barbara Streisand?

74.

SAM 1

(with a smile)

He looked like Barbara Streisand.

We used to hide his Bible when he

passed out. Drove the guy nuts.

Sam 2 nods, remembering. A pause.

SAM 2

How do you carve these things?

SAM 1

Want me to show you?

Sam 2 nods. Sam 1 picks up a block of wood, grabs an exacto

blade. Demonstrates.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

You need to hold the wood away

from you. Like this.

SAM 2

You're shaking.

Sam 2 isn't kidding. Though he is carving the block of

wood, Sam 1 can't keep it steady.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Why are you shaking?

SAM 1

Watch what I'm doing.

(then)

You watching?

SAM 2

Yeah.

SAM 1

Now you try.

Sam 1 hands the wood and exacto blade to Sam 2.

Sam 2 attempts to whittle. He smiles, a little embarrassed.

SAM 2

I suck.

SAM 1

You'll get the hang of it.

(a beat)

You see, that's a little better

already.

75.

Suddenly Sam 1 turns around and has a vicious coughing fit.

It actually seems to propel Sam 1 out of his chair and up

onto his feet. Sam 2 watches with concern. Eventually the

coughing subsides.

SAM 2

What's happening to you?

Sam 1 averts his gaze.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Listen, I realize I've been less

than cooperative. But I want to

change that. You and me, we need

to work together. And that starts

with not keeping secrets from

each other.

(a beat)

Now what's going on?

Sam 1 tells the truth.

SAM 1

I think I'm dying.

Sam 2 stares back at him.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

There's blood in everything. My

urine. My vomit. I've got a

constant headache. Dizzy spells.

(a beat)

The same thing happened to the

other clones. I saw it when I

hacked into the Old Man. After

three years they all started to

get sick. Now it's happening to

me. Well, it's been happening for

a while now. A couple of weeks.

SAM 2

What do you think it is?

SAM 1

Maybe we don't live that long.

Maybe we start to decompose or

something.

SAM 2

Jesus.

Suddenly Sam 1 closes his eyes -- SWAYS -- looks like he's

going to pass out.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Hey hey hey, you okay?

76.

Sam 2 stands and moves to Sam 1. Holds him up, checks his

temperature.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Why don't you lie down for a

while? Take some tranqs. Get

some sleep.

SAM 1

(grim smile)

No tranqs. I don't think I would

ever wake up again.

Sam 1 manages a nod.

Sam 2 hooks his arm around Sam 1's shoulder, helps him from

the room.

123   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                      123

Sam 2 deposits Sam 1 onto the bed. He removes Sam 1's

backpack, eases a pillow under his head. Sam 1 is instantly

asleep. Sam 2 pulls the comforter over him.

Sam 2 begins to leave the room, sees Sam 1's backpack on

the floor, the VP sticking out of it. Curious, Sam 2 grabs

the VP.

FLASHING on the VP's SCREEN: "Last Transmission: 15:14pm."

CUT TO:

124   INT. REC ROOM                                               124

Sam 2 enters the Rec Room and shuts the door. He moves to

one of the tables and sits down, POPS on the VP.

ON THE VP MONITOR we begin to re-watch the conversation

between Eve Bell and Sam 1. Obviously we are only seeing

Eve's face on the screen, but WE HEAR Sam 1's voice in the

background.

SAM 1 (O.S.)

Uh, Bell Residence?

EVE

This is the Bell residence.

SAM 2

(commenting as he

watches)

No you didn't...

SAM 1 (O.S.)

I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

77.

EVE

I'm sorry, she passed away some

years ago.

Sam 2 and Sam 1 have exactly the same reaction at the same

time.

SAM 1 (O.S.)                           SAM 2

No...no way.                     No...no way.

SAM 1 (O.S.)

Tess Bell? Are you sure?

EVE

Uh, yeah, I think so, I'm her

daughter.

(then)

Can I help you?

I'm her daughter. A couple of days ago Sam 2 didn't know he

had a daughter, and now he's seeing her as a teenager, a

young woman. He is stunned.

Sam 2 continues to watch the message but we

CUT TO:

125   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- DAY                                 125

Sam 1 fast asleep. Sam 2 watches him from the doorway.

126   INT. STORAGE CUBBY                                            126

Gerty is just continuing with his tasks like nothing is

happening. Right now he's STACKING ready-meals and

miscellaneous lunar snacks into neat columns.

Sam 2 walks up.

SAM 2

Gerty, I need to talk to you.

GERTY

Of course, Sam, how can I help?

SAM 2

We found the hidden room. We know

about the other clones.

A long pause. Then:

GERTY

I don't know of a hidden room.

78.

SAM 2

The hidden room under the Return

Vehicle, Gerty. You know what I'm

talking about. We found it on our

own. Lunar doesn't know anything

about it.

A beat.

GERTY

The lower deck is out of bounds

to awakened clones --

SAM 2

Ordinarily, Gerty, but what with

there being two of us awake at

the same time, and what with the

situation being unprecedented,

the rules have had to change. Do

you understand?

GERTY

I understand the situation is

unprecedented.

SAM 2

Good.

(a beat)

Gerty, how long does it take for

a clone to wake up?

GERTY

A clone is awake the moment his

pod is opened. But he is not

fully conscious for several

hours.

A beat.

SAM 2

Gerty, we need to wake up a new

clone.

GERTY

I am not permitted to do that,

Sam.

SAM 2

If we don't wake up another clone

me and the other Sam will die.

We'll die, Gerty. Do you

understand?

GERTY

Yes.

79.

SAM 2

Do you want me and the other Sam

to die?

GERTY

That is the last thing I want.

SAM 2

Then you have to wake up a new

clone. Okay, pal?

Sam 2 waits for a response. And waits.

CUT TO:

127   INT. COMMS ROOM                                            127

CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN

The "ping-ping-ping" of an alarm.

Appearing on The Old Man's monitor: "RESCUE UNIT ELIZA:

ARRIVAL TIME, 6 HOURS and 19 MINUTES."

CUT TO:

128   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                     128

Sam 1 fast asleep in bed.

129   SAM 1'S DREAM                                              129

A stretch of green grass dissected by a dirt path. A light

breeze. Endless blue sky above. No clouds. No visible sun.

130   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                     130

Back on the sleeping Sam 1. Deep breaths. Eyelids twitching

slightly.

131   SAM 1'S DREAM -- CONTINUED                                 131

In the distance, sitting beneath a tree on a blanket, we

see TESS BELL. She is removing items from a picnic basket.

Sam enters the frame, his back to the camera. He watches

his wife for a few moments, maintaining his distance.

Tess looks up and sees Sam. She lifts her hand, waves.

80.

ON SAM -- IN THE DREAM

Sam's expression is blank at first, but then he smiles at

Tess, waves back.

132   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                      132

Sam 1's eyes open slowly. He's awake.

Was his dream a memory? A premonition? Or was it simply

made up?

ANOTHER ANGLE -- SAM 1

A BLEARY Sam 1 yawns and stretches his arms over his head.

He reaches across the bed and rips a couple of tissues from

a box of Kleenex, blows his nose.

Afterwards he checks the tissues: a thick RED GOO came out

of his nose, the color and consistency of tomato puree.

Yeah, gross.

Sam 1 rolls out of bed, plants his feet on the ground.

The base seems eerily quiet. Too quiet. Sam 1 stands and

crosses to the door.

133   INT. CORRIDOR                                               133

Sam 1 begins to walk left, down towards the Rec Room and

the Monitoring Station, but hesitates -- he turns the other

way, towards the Infirmary, heads that way instead.

134   INT. INFIRMARY -- CONTINUOUS                                134

Lying in one of the Infirmary beds, eyes closed, a NETWORK

of WIRES attached to his chest...Sam. We don't know which

Sam it is yet. He is clean shaven. He looks like any one of

the clones down in the secret chamber; then again he could

just as easily be Sam 2.

And that's what Sam 1 naturally assumes as he enters the

Infirmary and sees him lying there. Sam 1 moves closer,

curious, until he is standing right at the edge of the bed.

Sam 1 reaches out his hand to wake him up when there is a

voice from the doorway behind:

SAM 2

Don't touch him.

81.

Our suspicions are now confirmed. The Sam in the Infirmary

bed is a new clone. We will call him SAM 3.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

He's not conscious yet. Gerty and

I only woke him up a few hours

ago.

Sam 1 is not even remotely on the same page.

SAM 1

Why?

Sam 2 puts his finger to his lips. Then:

SAM 2

Come to the Rec Room.

Sam 2 turns and leaves. Sam 1 follows slowly, one or two

glances at the sleeping clone along the way.

135   INT. REC ROOM                                                135

We cut straight to the Rec Room and the conversation

between Sam 1 and Sam 2.

SAM 2

When the Rescue Unit arrives

they'll expect to find a body in

the crashed Rover, right?

(a beat)

We've got our body.

SAM 1

(points towards the

Infirmary)

That guy?

Sam 2 nods.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

They'll expect to find a dead

body in the crashed Rover.

SAM 2

I know.

SAM 1

(stunned)

You're going to kill him?

SAM 2

Someone's got to pull the short

straw here, better someone who's

unconscious than you or me.

82.

Sam 1 simply digesting the gravity of Sam 2's plan.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

If we go through with this, I'm

going to need your help hauling

him out to the crash site.

SAM 1

What about us? Eliza arrives,

finds you and me as the welcome

party --

SAM 2

They're not going to find you and

me as the welcome party, they're

going to find me. You're going to

blast back to Earth before they

get here in one of the Helium 3

containers.

(a beat)

You're going home.

Sam 1 wasn't expecting that.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

You've done your three years. I

can't expect you to stick around.

Maybe you can meet Eve in person.

A beat.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

I saw the message on the VP. Eve

is beautiful. She looks like her

mom.

Sam 1 realizes that Sam 2 knows everything. There are no

secrets between them now.

They both absorb the impact of knowing Tess is dead.

Finally:

SAM 1

How do you think she died?

SAM 2

I don't know.

(then)

Jane died of cancer. I mean, it

was in the family. Who knows? Or

maybe it was an accident? Could

have been a million things.

SAM 1

I wish I'd been there.

83.

SAM 2

Yeah. Me too.

The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief.

CUT TO:

136   EXT. MOON BASE -- DAY                                         136

Shot of Selene from across the lunar plane. The base looks

almost peaceful. No evidence of the DRAMA going on inside.

137   INT. CORRIDOR                                                 137

The two Sams are testing out the CARGO CONTAINER to see if

their plan is going to work and Sam 1 can actually fit

inside.

These containers were designed to carry cannisters of

Helium 3, not to accommodate human beings.

Sam 1 looks in increasingly bad shape. Blanket draped

around his shoulders -- gaunt, bobbing, shivering.

SAM 2

Go for it.

Sam 1 hunches and slowly insinuates himself into the

container -- yes, he fits, but it's tight, like really

tight -- Sam 1 can anticipate one hell of a stiff neck by

the time he steps out onto terra firma.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Comfy?

SAM 1

No.

Sam 2 chuckles.

SAM 2

But you fit. That's good. You

fit.

With a HEAVE Sam 2 PULLS Sam 1 from the container.

CUT TO:

138   INT. INFIRMARY -- DAY                                         138

Gerty is running tests on the unconscious Sam 3.

84.

Sam 1 and Sam 2 stand on opposite sides of the room. Both

clones seem uneasy. They can't look at each other. They

can't look at Sam 3. Their eyes roam every inch of the room

just about before finally settling on Gerty.

Regardless of Sam 3 being unconscious, are they really

going to kill him?

CUT TO:

139   INT. COMMS ROOM                                            139

Sam 2 sits at the comms unit recording the message, a smile

plastered on his face, as WIDE as it is FAKE.

SAM 2

Sam Bell reporting to Central.

19:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 14.

(a beat)

Evening Overmeyers, evening

Thompson! According to the Old

Man Rescue Unit Eliza will be

here in just over three hours.

Not a moment too soon! I never

thought I'd say this, but I want

to get out there, I want to work.

I feel like a kid who's been

grounded. Looking forward to

Eliza straightening everything

out and things getting back to

normal around here. Well...that's

it. I'll let you know how it

goes. Over and out, gentlemen.

Sam 2 sends the message, his SMILE instantly COLLAPSING. He

mutters under his breath:

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

Bastards.

140   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- DAY                              140

Sam 1 is sitting on the edge of his bed holding the

photograph of the pregnant Tess -- staring with great

concentration -- almost penetrative -- like he's trying to

will himself into the photograph.

We find out what's running through his head, cutting to:

141   SAM 1'S DREAM                                              141

Sam 1 has gone back to his dream -- or his vision -- of

Tess sitting on the picnic blanket beneath the tree.

85.

Sam and Tess continue to wave to one another. Sam hasn't

moved. Tess calls out:

TESS

Come on!

Suddenly we hear a voice.

SAM 2 (O.S.)

Sam?

142   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                        142

Sam 2 is standing at the door. Sam 1 looks up at him.

SAM 2

We need to do it. We need to do

it now. He'll be conscious any

minute.

(a beat)

We've been putting it off for

long enough.

Sam 1 stares back at Sam 2 with defiance.

SAM 1

We don't have to do anything. I

changed my mind.

Sam 2 isn't following.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

I'm not going back.

(a beat)

I'm coughing up blood, I'm as

white as a ghost. I look like I

belong in a graveyard. I meet Eve

now, I'll scare the shit out of

her more than anything else.

D'you think she'll even come

within ten feet of me, the way I

look?

SAM 2

What are you talking about?

She's your daughter, man! She's

not going to care what you...

SAM 1

(angry)

She's not! She's not... my

daughter. At least, I'm not her

father. Not to her.

Sam 2 keeps quiet.

86.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

I'll put myself in the Rover,

I'll be the body -- it was me to

begin with anyway, right? You go

back to Earth. You go back.

You're healthy. You've got three

years ahead of you. You stand a

much better chance than I do. The

other guy....Gerty can get him up

to speed...he can be here to meet

Eliza when they arrive.

Sam 1 seems to have it all figured out. Although Sam 2

should in some ways be relieved by Sam 1's decision, he

looks closer to distraught.

SAM 2

This is wrong. What are we

supposed to do? Sit around here

and wait to die? Fuck that!

SAM 1

I don't know.

(beat)

It's what we were designed to do.

Both Sams struggle to hold in their emotions; Sam 1 morose,

Sam 2 angry.

SAM 2

Screw that! I'll go! ...And I'm

going to find this asshole, Sam

Bell, and ask him why the hell he

put us through this shit!

Sam 1 looks concerned.   Sam 2 reads his mind.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

I'll be careful. I'll keep Eve

out of it. She wont even know I

exist.

Sam 1 smiles wearily, watching his old self.

SAM 1

You're a good guy, Sam.

SAM 2

I might stop shaving; It suits

us.

(beat)

If all our memories are implants,

no disrespect, but I think its

about time I got some of my own,

as well.

87.

SAM 1

Yeah. You should travel.     I've

always wanted to do that.

SAM 2

I'd like that.

CUT TO:

143   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                              143

Driving to the crash site. Sam 2 at the wheel, Sam 1 riding

shotgun. Both men staring ahead in silence.

MATTHEW

Where all the trouble really started. Matthew, the stalled

Harvester, with the crashed Rover still trapped beneath it.

The crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater

shipwreck.

The Rover enters the frame, beginning to slow down as it

approaches the crash site. Sam 2 rolls the Rover to a

standstill about ten feet from the front of the Harvester.

144   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER                    144

Sam 2 keeps the engine running as Sam 1 takes a handful of

TRANQUILIZERS one by one, washing down each pill with a

swig from a bottle of water.

Afterwards: a long pause. The two Sams sitting side by

side, staring across the bleak landscape. Neither of them

wants to say good-bye particularly.

SAM 1

Tess came in for the interview,

remember?

Sam 2 is nodding away. Of course he remembers.

SAM 1 (CONT'D)

She was so beautiful. Even   if she

wasn't the best candidate,   I just

knew I had to give her the   job. I

thought she was so sweet.

(a beat)

And then it was the end of   the

summer.

SAM 2

She was going back to San

Francisco.

(MORE)

88.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

You knew you had to take a

chance. So you called her.

You were terrified and wrote that

whole speech for her answer

machine --

(a beat)

But I didn't need it because Tess

answered the phone. And I could

tell in her voice as we talked,

she was thinking...

"Why has Sam called me?"

"The internship's over, why's he

called me at home?"

And then I asked her if she was

going to Adrian Fiddle's barbecue

and...

Sam 1 has dropped off to sleep. The back and forth exchange

is now essentially Sam 2's monologue.

SAM 2 (CONT'D)

That's when I knew she liked me.

Because she didn't want to talk

to anyone else! She'd get up, get

some potato salad, go to the

bathroom, but she'd always come

back. And then we kissed. On the

steps in front of her apartment

building.

Sam 2 finally turns and looks at Sam 1. Sam 1's head cocked

to one side, eyes closed.

Sam 2 lifts the helmet off Sam 1's lap -- carefully lowers

the helmet onto Sam 1's head.

145   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                     145

Sam 2 LOPES towards the crashed rover holding Sam 1 in both

arms like a bride. He places Sam 1 on the ground and PRIZES

open the rover door -- he slowly slides Sam 1 inside.

Inside the Rover Sam 1 lies with his head jammed awkwardly

against the passenger side door. At once he looks peaceful

and wretchedly uncomfortable.

Sam 2 can barely bring himself to look at Sam 1. With both

hands he FORCES the door CLOSED, pivots around and slowly

BOBS back to his rover.

146   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER                    146

Sam 2 driving back to base. He has removed his helmet and

is brushing tears from his eyes with his glove.

Gerty is continuing to run tests on Sam 3. Sam 2 enters. He

carries the freighted exhaustion of a man who has just

completed a long and difficult journey.

SAM 2

How long before he's conscious,

Gerty?

GERTY

The new clone will be conscious

within one hour.

SAM 2

That's good. That's very good.

GERTY

Sam?   Where is Sam?

SAM 2

He's gone home, Gerty.

Sam 2 leaves.

149   INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY                             149

Sam 2 is loading OXYGEN CANISTERS into the CARGO CONTAINER

in preparation for his trip back to Earth.

Sam 2 working FAST, a sense of URGENCY. Eliza will be there

in a mere 90 minutes! It's coming down to the wire.

Gerty glides in as he works.

GERTY

Sam, this is not going to work.

SAM 2

What? Why not?

90.

Now Sam 2 loads food into the cargo container -- moon

snacks, rations, etc. -- and bottles of water. His final

addition is a 5 kilo load of precious Helium3; A good 15

million dollars worth!

GERTY

If the Rescue Unit examine my

memory banks they will discover

what has taken place over the

last week. As you know I record

everything. If they are

suspicious, the first thing they

will do is search my memory

banks, and this would put you in

considerable danger.

Sam 2 straightens up, giving Gerty his full attention now.

This is serious. It could ruin everything.

The fact that Gerty has brought it up indicates that the

robot's loyalties lie ultimately with Sam.

GERTY (CONT'D)

I recommend erasing my memory

banks. I can reboot myself once

you have departed.

SAM 2

So that's what we're going to

have to do.

(beat)

Are you ok with that?

GERTY

I'll require your assistance,

Sam.

SAM 2

Sure, just let me finish this.

Sam 2 continues his work.

pinned in a trap. He's still breathing.

91.

SAM 1'S DREAM

Once again we see Tess beneath the tree sitting on the

blanket. She looks over at Sam, continuing to wave.

TESS

Come on, Sam! Sam Bell! Come on!

Sam begins to walk towards Tess.

152   I/E. CRASHED ROVER/MOON SURFACE                            152

Back on Sam 1. The glass of his helmet is beginning to MIST

with blood. Sam sees a sliver of the sun as he dawns on his

side of the moon. He closes his eyes for the last time.

CUT TO:

153   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                    153

Sam 2 stands before Gerty.

SAM 2

I've set your computer to reboot

the second I've blasted off.

GERTY

Okay, Sam.

SAM 2

Thanks for all your help, Gerty.

I wish I could say I was going to

miss you, buddy, but to be

honest, I can't wait to get away

from here.

GERTY

I understand, Sam. I hope life

is everything you remember it to

be.

SAM 2

Thanks. Are you sure you're

going to be ok?

GERTY

Of course. The new Sam and I

will be back to our programming

as soon as I have finished

rebooting.

SAM 2

Gerty, I'm not programmed.

92.

Gerty doesn't respond.    Sam 2 seems troubled.

Sam 2 leans forward and activates the Memory Erase button.

Gerty's READOUT SCREEN begins to TWITCH and FLASH with

RANDOM DATA -- then slowly FADES TO BLACK.

The Robot has been officially SHUT DOWN.

Gerty just stands there. Completely still. As lifeless as a

toy.

Sam 2 heads out of the room at top speed.

155   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      155

Sam 2 pauses at the window...looking for Eliza. The Rescue

Unit is so close Sam 2 might actually be able to pick out

their spacecraft.

And he can! It's tiny, but nevertheless it's there -- a

metallic spacecraft, glinting like a jewel -- and heading

steadily towards the Moon.

There isn't a moment to lose. Sam 2 swings around, heads

for the CARGO CONTAINER.

We remain inside the Monitoring Station as Sam 2 climbs

inside the Cargo Container He readies himself. Says a

little prayer and... he cant do it! Cursing at himself and

glancing at the time ticking away before Eliza lands, he

jumps back out of the CARGO CONTAINER and runs back into

the base.

CUT TO:

156   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      156

Sam 2 sits down before the Old Man. Eliza's imminent

arrival causing increased STRESS and TENSION.

Sam 2 takes out the piece of paper on which the COORDINATES

of the Jammers are printed out.

He starts to frantically type, altering the PATH of the

HARVESTERS.

93.

157   EXT. MARK                                                    157

Mark trundling along at half-speed. The Harvester suddenly

changes direction -- veering sharply to the left and

heading up over a steep slope.

CUT TO:

158   INT. MONITORING STATION                                      158

Back on Sam 2 as he RAPIDLY types, makes an error, screams:

SAM 2

Fuck!

Pounds the delete button, continuing to type coordinates

into the Old Man -- He's done! He leaps out of his chair

and tears off through the base towards the cargo container.

CUT TO:

159   EXT. WIDE SHOT -- THE MOON                                   159

As Eliza's spacecraft sets its sights on Selene, we see the

Cargo Container ROCKET through the sky in the opposite

direction.

CUT TO:

160   INT. MOON BASE SELENE/QUICK SHOTS                            160

For a few moments all is quiet inside the base.

The "PING-PING-PING" of the Old Man.

The grinding GURGLE of a computer readout.

This sequence echoes the tour at the very start of the

film, but the base has a decidedly different feel to it

now. It's like an abandoned house.

CUT TO:

161   INT. COMMS ROOM                                              161

CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN

On the monitor: "RESCUE UNIT ELIZA: ARRIVED."

94.

162   EXT. ELIZA'S SPACECRAFT/MOON SURFACE                          162

A box shaped spacecraft, all menace and angles, slowly

DESCENDING towards the lunar surface.

CUT TO:

163   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                       163

Gerty sits lifeless.

We hear the sounds of pressure doors opening. Unrecognized

voices as the landing crew enters the base, calling for

Sam.

Gerty comes to life.

His principal monitor POPS ON and his pincer-like HANDS

begin to TWITCH. His READOUT SCREEN streams with DATA.

Gerty's head begins to swivel left and right -- as if he's

awoken with a stiff neck -- eventually he SEES Sam 3,

crosses to him.

Just like that, Gerty continues his routine checks of Sam 3

-- studying Sam 3's heartbeat, his brain activity -- the

robot literally picking up where he left off.

And then Sam 3's eyes open. He is awake. He blinks at

Gerty, cloudy, groggy.

SAM 3

Where am I?

GERTY

Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You

had an accident.

Sam 3 staring ahead, trying to dig up the memory.

GERTY (CONT'D)

Do you remember what happened?

SAM 3

No, Gerty.

(a beat)

I don't remember a thing.

We hear heavy footsteps and voices closer now, just outside

the infirmary.

CUT TO:

95.

164   EXT. MARK/JAMMER/MOON SURFACE                               164

A CLOSE UP of MARK as the Harvester churns along and SLAMS

into an JAMMER with full force.

The Jammer wobbles unsteadily from the IMPACT, before

finally TOPPLING over, HAZING the air with lunar dust.

CUT TO:

165   EXT. CARGO CONTAINER/SPACE                                  165

The Cargo Container BULLETING through space, fire blasting

from its jets like the petals of an exotic flower.

CUT TO:

166   INT. CARGO CONTAINER                                        166

Sam 2 is seriously cramped inside one of the Helium 3

containers, about as comfortable as a pony in a dog kennel,

but nonetheless WHOOPING RAUCOUSLY at the sheer velocity of

the container -- as well as, and perhaps even more so, the

fact that he has successfully escaped the base.

He's going home.

CUT TO:

167   I/E. CRASHED ROVER/MOON SURFACE -- DAY                      167

Sam 1 has stopped breathing. The sun shines on his face.

168   SAM'S DREAM                                                 168

Sam walks towards Tess. He sits down in front of her on the

blanket.

A beautiful picnic is spread out before them. Tess has

never looked so radiant, so beautiful. Light from the sky

pours into her upturned face.

TESS

What took you so long?

Sam just smiles back at her. She hands him a bottle of wine

and a corkscrew.

CAMERA PANS UPWARD -- not a cloud in sight -- but we are

just able to pick out the chalky outline of the MOON,

resembling a white thumb print in the blue sky.

96.

HOLD THIS shot of the Moon for a few seconds before we

FADE TO BLACK.

169   INT. COMMS ROOM                                               169

On the Comms Unit monitor there is a BLAST of STATIC,

followed by a FLASHING MESSAGE:

"LIVE FEED AVAILABLE."

THE END
