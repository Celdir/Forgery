INTERVIEWER

Deputy minister, what do you believe

is behind this recent increase in

terrorist bombings?

HELPMANN

Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless

minority of people seems to have

forgotten certain good old fashioned

virtues. They just can't stand seeing

the other fellow win. If these people

would just play the game, instead of

standing on the touch line heckling -

INTERVIEWER

In fact, killing people -

HELPMANN

- In fact, killing people - they'd

get a lot more out of life.

INTERVIEWER

Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to

those critics who maintain that the

Ministry Of Information has become

too large and unwieldy ...?

HELPMANN

David ... in a free society

information is the name of the game.

You can't win the game if you're a

man short.

INTERVIEWER

And the cost of it all, Deputy

Minister? Seven percent of the gross

national produce ...

HELPMANN

I understand this concern on behalf

of the tax-payers. People want value

for money and a cost-effective

service.

3   INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT            3

HELPMANN

That is why we always insist on the

principle of Information Retrieval

Charges. These terrorists are not

pulling their weight, and it's

absolutely right and fair that those

found guilty should pay for their

periods of detention and the

Information Retrieval Procedures used

in their interrogation.

Scenes 4-12 Deleted.                              4-12 Deleted.

13  INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT           13

INTERVIEWER

Do you think that the government is

winning the battle against

terrorists?

HELPMANN

On yes. Our morale is much higher

than theirs, we're fielding all their

strokes, running a lot of them out,

and pretty consistently knocking them

for six. I'd say they're nearly out

of the game.

INTERVIEWER

But the bombing campaign is now in

its thirteenth year ...

HELPMANN

Beginner's luck.

INTERVIEWER

Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

HELPMANN

Thank you, David ... and a very merry

Christmas to you all.

Don't you worry love, we'll have

everything shipshape in a jiffy.

BILL

That's it. Nothing to worry about.

CHARLIE

It's Buttle downstairs who can worry,

There must be some mistake ... Mr

We don't make mistakes.

JACK

Sam!

SAM

Jack!

JACK

Long time no see!

SAM

Well, since you disappeared up the

ladder of Information Retrieval ... I

don't expect to see you slumming in

Records - what's the problem?

JACK

Problem? - No problem - yes,

everything's going fantastically

well, wonderful, marvelous, great

career prospects, Alison in great

shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm

on Security Level Five now, and Mr

Helpmann relies on me more and more,

yes, couldn't be better, I feel

terrifically motivated and job-

rewarded -

SAM

You sound worried.

JACK

Me? - if I'm worried about anyone,

it's you. What happened to you, Sam?

You were the brightest of us -

JACK

What's the matter?

SAM

Sorry. Nothing.

(snapping out of it)

See you - I'm going to be late.

JACK

(looking at his watch)

You are late.

SAM

Even later.

JACK

Sam, your life is going wrong - let

your friends tell you - Records is a

dead end department, no Security

Level worth a damn, it's impossible

to get noticed -

SAM

Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous,

wonderful - remember me to Alison -

and the - er - twins.

JACK

Triplets.

SAM

Really? - God, how time flies!

JILL

I want to report a wrongful arrest.

PORTER

(looking at form)

You want Information Adjustments.

Different department.

JILL

(exasperated but

controlled)

I've been to Information Adjustments.

They sent me here. They told me you

had a form I had to fill in.

PORTER

Have you got an Arrest Receipt?

JILL

Yes.

PORTER

Is it stamped?

JILL

(producing Buttle receipt)

Stamped?

PORTER

(examining receipt)

No, there's no stamp on it. You see!

I can't give you the form until it's

stamped.

JILL

Where do I get it stamped?

PORTER

Information Adjustments.

26  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             26

KURTZMAN

Perhaps the machine's on the blink!

It keeps picking up old films. That

can't he right, can it?

SAM

It's not the machine. There's a

mismatch on the personnel code

numbers... Ah there we go! That's a

B58/732 when it should be a T47/215

... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06,

debited against his account for

electrical procedures, not Buttle.

KURTZMAN

Oh my God, a mistake!

SAM

It's not our mistake!

KURTZMAN

(eagerly)

Isn't it? Whose is it?

SAM

Information Retrieval.

KURTZMAN

Oh, good!

SAM

Expediting has put in for electrical

procedures in respect of Buttle,

Archibald, shoe repair operative, but

Security has invoiced Admin for

Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer

KURTZMAN

What a relief! I don't know what I'd

do if you ever got promoted.

SAM

Don't worry.

KURTZMAN

But if they did promote you

SAM

I've told you before. I'd turn it

down.

KURTZMAN

Would you really, Sam?

SAM

Really.

KURTZMAN

(churned up)

You've been promoted.

KURTZMAN

It's your mother isn't it? Pulling

strings again.

SAM

(explodes)

What a BITCH!

DOCTOR

Now, when you come in tomorrow, Mrs

Lowry, we'll make a little tuck here

... and there ...

SAM

(angrily)

I just wish you would stop

interfering, mother! I don't want

promotion. I'm happy where I am.

MOTHER

No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson

to you - he never had your brains but

he's got the ambition. You haven't

got the ambition but luckily you've

got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann

was very close -

DOCTOR

Now, Mrs Lowry, don't get upset

(so SAM)

Please wait in reception, Mr Lowry,

you're giving her wrinkles.

MOTHER

You see!

SAM

(groans)

DOCTOR

Now Mrs Lowry, try to relax. You must

trust me. I'll make you twenty years

younger ...

SAM

Huh!

DOCTOR

(giving Sam a dirty look)

... twenty-five if we just drain the

excess fluid from the pouches ...

MOTHER

Dr Jaffe, you're a genius. Would you

like to be Surgeon General? Four

Star. I know everybody.

DOCTOR

Well they won't know you when I've

finished with you.

DOCTOR

First we must eliminate the excess

derma ... so! ... Then the flaccid

tissues under the eyes ... And now

the forehead ... Zip! I lift the

wrinkles and worry lines right up

into the wi- into the hairline, comme

ca ...

DOCTOR

And now the template ... There ...

there ... there ... Now a bit of

sticky ... There we go!

(triumphantly)

Already she is twice as beautiful as

she was before - voila!

SAM

My God, it works.

MOTHER

(in full flow)

Mr Helpmann was very close to your

poor father. He was very close to me.

Still is. He'll take you under his

wing at Information Retrieval. You'll

like it when you get there.

SAM

You're not listening, mother.

MOTHER

It's a present for my son.

MOTHER

I hope you like it. It's very

exclusive.

SAM

What is it?

MOTHER

It's something for executives.

MAITRE D

Madam Lowry, how exquisite to see you

again. Merry Christmas.

MOTHER

Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

SPIRO

(blocking Sam's way)

I'm sorry but ...

MOTHER

You remember Samuel, my son.

SPIRO

{suddenly unctious)

Oh, but of course ...

MOTHER

We're meeting Mrs Terrain.

SAM

Are we?

SPIRO

Ah yes, the lady is waiting.

SAM

Mother, I thought we were going to be

able to talk .... Oh God, she's got

what's he name with her.

MRS TERRAIN

Ida! Sam!

MOTHER

Alma, how are you? You're looking

wonderful! Hello, Shirley.

SHIRLEY

(shy to Sam)

Salt?

MRS TERRAIN

(to Shirley)

Not yet.

(to Sam and Mother)

Happy Christmas, Sam.

MOTHER

Sorry we're late. Shall we order? Get

it out of the way. What are you going

to have Alma?

MRS TERRAIN

I can't make up my mind whether to

have a number one or a number two.

What do you recommend, Spiro?

SPIRO

(conspiratorially)

Between you and me, Madam, today the

number two.

MRS TERRAIN

Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are

you going to have?

SHIRLEY

(panics quietly)

SPIRO

(conspiratorially)

Between you and me, Mademoiselle,

today the number one. Madam Lowry?

MOTHER

Oh, to hell with the diet, a number

eight, please.

SPIRO

A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I

may say so.

(to Sam)

Monsieur?

SAM

(brusquely)

A steak, please. Rare.

(to his mother)

Mother, I need to ...

SPIRO

(piqued)

Monsieur. Quel numero.

SAM

(handing back menu)

I don't know which numero.

SPIRO

(writing on pad)

Numero, trois.

MOTHER

(trying to restart things)

Alma, you wicked thing ...

(indicating bandages)

you've started your treatment.

MRS TERRAIN

You noticed.

(enthusiastically)

I must tell you all about it.

SAM

(to his mother)

Mother, will you listen to

SPIRO

(showing off that he

remembers who's ordered

what)

Numero huit, braised veal in wine

sauce.

(he sets it in front of

Sam's Mother)

MRS TERRAIN

It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe

and gone to Dr. Chapman.

SPIRO

Numero deux, duck a l'orange.

(he sets it in front of Mrs

Terrain)

MOTHER

The acid man?

MRS TERRAIN

Really, Ida, just because his

techniques are revolutionary ... I

don't go around calling Dr Jaffe the

knife man.

SPIRO

Numero une, crevettes a la

mayonaaise.

(he sets it in front of

Shirley)

MOTHER

I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to

sound so ...

MRS TERRAIN

That's all right Ida ... it's just

that he's such an artist. To him,

cutting is so crude ... so primitive.

SPIRO

Numero trois, steak.

(He sets this in front of

Sam)

Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.

ALL BUT SAM

Merci.

MRS TERRAIN

Acid on the other hand, can be used

for such wonderfully subtle shading,

such delicate nuances - just like a

Rembrant etching ... and it's so much

quicker. Why, if it weren't for a

teensy-weensy complication - the

doctor said it could have happened to

anyone - I would have had these

bandages off yesterday.

SHIRLEY

(to Sam, after attracting

her mother's attention and

receiving a nod)

Salt?

MOTHER

What were we saying?

SAM

(picking bomb debris out of

his brown lump)

This isn't rare!

MOTHER

By the way, I saw a wonderful idea

for Christmas presents at the

chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift

tokens.

MRS TERRAIN

Oh, that sounds marvellous.

MOTHER

Yes, they're good at any doctor's and

at many of the major hospitals - and

they're accepted for gynecological

complications including Caesarian

section.

SAM

Look - please - I'm sorry - but

honestly, mother, this is -

MOTHER.

I quite agree! - It's impossible!

MAITRE D

I am sorry, Madam ... I don't know

what to say ... this very rarely

happens to us - I'll do what I can

straight away

MRS TERRAIN

Really, Sam - when are you going to

do something about these terrorists?

SAM

What? Now? It's my lunch hour.

MOTHER

Actually, Alma, that's one of the

little things I was dying to tell you

... Sam's been promoted to

Information Retrieval.

SAM

(angry and surprised)

Mother!

MRS TERRAIN

Oh that's wonderful! Congratulations

Sam...

SHIRLEY

You can show those fucking murderous

bastards a thing or two.

MRS TERRAIN

(shocked and embarrassed)

Shirley!

SAM

Stop this!

(leaping to his feet)

I'm not being promoted. I'm not going

to Information Retrieval!

(he scrumples promotion

notification which he has

been holding and throws it

on the floor)

If I want you to stick your oar in,

mother, I'll tell you where to stick

it!

SHIRLEY

(back to her uncertain

form)

Pepper...?

SAM

Look - I've got to get back -

MOTHER

Sam ... you haven't had dessert.

SAM

I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I

don't want promotion. I don't want

anything.

MOTHER

Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course

you want something. You must have

hopes, wishes, dreams.

SAM

(shouts loud)

NO, NOTHING. NOT EVEN DREAMS!

Hello. Mr Lowry?

SAM

Who's that?

PHONE VOICE

Put the phone down and your hands up.

SAM

(into the phone)

What? Who is this?

TUTTLE

Nice and easy now. Keep your hands

where I can see them.

SAM

What is this?

(indignantly)

Who the hell are you?

TUTTLE

Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At

your service.

SAM

Tuttle! Are you from Central

Services?

TUTTLE

Ha!!

SAM

But ... I called Central Services.

TUTTLE

They're a bit overworked these days.

Luckily I intercepted your call.

SAM

What?

SAM

Wait a minute, what was that business

with the gun?

TUTTLE

A little precaution, sir. I've had

traps set for me before now. There

are people in Central Services who'd

love to get their hands on Harry

Tuttle.

SAM

Are you saying this is illegal?

TUTTLE

Well, yes ... and no. Officially,

only Central Service operatives are

supposed to touch this stuff ...

Could you hold these.

TUTTLE

(he hands Sam a bunch of

wires that he has detached)

... but, with all the new rules and

regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon

... they can't get decent staff any

more ... so ... they tend to turn a

blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.

(he hands Sam a torch)

... Mind you, if ever they could

prove I'd been working on their

equipment ... well, that's a

different matter ... up a bit with

the torch, sir.

SAM

Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to

work for Central Services?

TUTTLE

Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're

getting warm -

SAM

The pace?

TUTTLE

The paperwork, couldn't stand the

paperwork.

(indicating the torch)

Over to the left please, if you don't

mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's

more bits of paper in Central

Services than bits of pipe - read

this, fill in that, hand in the other

- listen, this old system of yours

could be on fire and I couldn't even

turn on the kitchen tap without

filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody

paperwork.

SAM

(mildly)

Well I suppose one has to expect a

certain amount

TUTTLE

Why? I came into this game for

adventure - go anywhere, travel

light, get in, get out, wherever

there's trouble, a man alone. Now

they've got the whole country

sectioned of and you can't move

without a form. I'm the last of a

breed. Ah ha! Found it!

(he holds up a small

charred gadget)

There's your problem.

SAM

Can you fix it?

TUTTLE

No. But I can bypass it with one of

these

SAM

Fine.

TUTTLE

Are you expecting anyone?

SAM

No. Wait here.

Yes?

He's tampered with it, Dowser.

DOWSER

...ampered. with it, Spoor.

SAM

Look, I'm sorry about your wasted

journey

SPOOR

(to Dowser)

I think we'd better have a look.

DOWSER

... have a look.

SAM

No you can't.

SAM

Just a minute!

SAM

Have you got a 27B/6?

SPOOR

(to Sam)

Now look what you've done to him.

SAM

Have you got one or haven't you?

SPOOR

Not ... as such ...

SPOOR

But we can get one.

SPOOR

(worried about Dowser)

It's all right, Terry, it's all

right, everything's all right.

SAM

(ushering them to the door)

I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a

stickler for paper work. Where would

we be if we didn't follow the correct

procedures?

SPOOR

We'll be back.

DOWSER

...Be back.

SAM

(Closing the door on them)

Thank you.

TUTTLE

Thanks, Lowry, you're a good man in a

tight corner.

SAM

Listen .. um ... I don't want to get

involved in any of this. But I work

at the Ministry of Information, and I

happen to know that Information

Retrieval have been looking for an

Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer.

You wouldn't by any chance be -

TUTTLE

(pleased)

My friends call me Harry. Information

Retrieval, eh? Interesting!

SAM

What do they want you or?

TUTTLE

Time to go.

SAM

Thank you very much. How much will

it...?

terrible trouble! Look at this! Look

at this!

SAM

(taking the paper)

A cheque.

KURTZMAN

The refund for Tuttle!

SAM

(startled)

Tuttle?

KURTZMAN

I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion

from the word go! He's been wrongly

charged for Electromemorytherapy and

someone somewhere is trying to make

us carry the can!

SAM

I've never seen a Ministry cheque

before.

KURTZMAN

We've got to get rid of it! There's

been a balls-up somewhere, and when

the music stops they'll jump on

whoever's holding the cheque!

SAM

Send it to somebody else. Send it to

Buttle. It's his cheque.

KURTZMAN

I've tried that! Population Census

have got him down as dormanted, the

Central Collective Storehouse

computer has got him down as deleted,

and the Information Retrieval have

got him down as inoperative ...

Security has him down as excised.,

Admin have him down as completed

SAM

Hang on.

SAM

He is dead.

KURTZMAN

Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll

never get rid of the damned thing!

What are we going to do?

SAM

Try next of kin.

KURTZMAN

(a revelation)

Next of kin!

SAM

There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle.

What's the number on the cheque?

KURTZMAN

(reading it)

27156789/074328/K.

SAM

Into memory. Now ... Central Banking

... Buttle, Veronica ... Deposit

KURTZMAN

(fervently)

Please don't come back! Please don't

come back!

SAM

Problem. She doesn't have a bank

account.

KURTZMAN

(hysterically)

Well, that's it! I may as well go and

hang myself! This sort of thing

couldn't have happened before the

stupid seventh tier reorganization!

That was Simmons doing! And he and

Jeffries always sit together at

lunch! The bastards!

(he thumps his hand hard on

the desk top)

Ow!

(He picks up the offending

cheque)

Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the

filing cabinet ... or destroy it ...

burn it ... eat it ...

SAM

You'd never get away with it.

Besides, you can't do that to

somebody's refund. It's Christmas.

There is one more option.

KURTZMAN

(depressed. Not really

believing it)

What?

SAM

Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the

cheque, tell her to sign her name on

the back, cash it at the corner sweet

shop.

KURTZMAN

That's brilliant!

SAM

I'll do it for you. Authorise the

cheque. What's the address?

KURTZMAN

Here. What do I do next?

SAM

Call the motor pool and authorise

personal transport.

KURTZMAN

Of course, of course. Leave it to me.

How do I authorize a cheque?

SAM

(separating the and blue

sheets)

Here we are. Pink and blue receipts.

All you've got to do is sign these

and the back of the cheque.

KURTZMAN

(exhausted after all the

emotion)

Oh God! I think I've broken a bone.

What a pathetic thing I am.

SAM

(taking the pen from him)

Here.

SAM

That's it.

KURTZMAN

You are good to me Sam.

SAM

Are you Mrs Buttle?

SAM

My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry. I'm

from the Ministry of Information.

(no response)

I've come to give you a cheque.

SAM

(indicting cheque)

It's a refund ... I'm afraid there

was a mistake.

MRS BUTTLE

Mistake?

SAM

(encouraged)

Yes. Not my department ... I'm only

records. It seems that Mr Buttle was

overcharged by Information Retrieval.

I don't think they usually make

mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose

we're all human.

Oh ... what happened to the ...?

Actually, my bringing this here is

rather unorthodox ... Usually any

payments are made through the central

computer ... but, er ... there were

certain difficulties, and rather than

cause delay, we thought you might

appreciate this now ... it being

Christmas.

MRS BUTTLE

My husband's dead, isn't he?

SAM

Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the

Ministry is always very scrupulous

about following up and eradicating

error. If you have any complaints

which you'd like to make, I'd be more

than happy to send you the

appropriate forms.

MRS BUTTLE

What have you done with his body?

SAM

Um ...

SAM

Look, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid

I don't know anything about it ...

I'm really just delivering the

cheque. Er ... If you wouldn't mind

signing these receipts

(producing blue and pink

receipts)

I'll go and leave you in peace.

Uh ...

He hadn't done anything ... He was

good ... What have you done with his

I delivered it.

Yes.

Is Mr Helpmann here?

MOTHER

Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.

I want to talk to him.

No hairline.

don't look like they've been mugged.

Chapman says it often happens with a

delicate skin like mine. Nothing to

worry about. He's promised me I'll

Well, I'm two years older.

She doesn't like me telling anyone

Er, I knew you looked different.

Remember how they used to stick out?

SAM

What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to

wonder if they were real.

What, my ears?

Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.

help you ... And I promised your

mother I'd take you onto the team at

information Retrieval. But I gather

that ...

please ... I ... STOP!! I can't stand

TYPIST

(quietly, still typing)

Can I help you?

EARPHONE

Oooooooh ... aaaaaahhh ... please ...

arrrrrghhhh no ... please ... Oh God,

No ... No, stop, I don't know ...

SAM

I'm looking for Officer 412/L.

TYPIST

I'm sure he won't be long now.

I thought so!

TYPIST

You can go in now.

72  INT.   JACK'S OFFICE                     DAY            72

SAM

Excuse me. Are you officer 412/L?

SAM

(a bit louder)

Er, excuse me!

SAM

(louder)

Excuse me.

SAM

(surprised)

Jack!!

JACK

(recovering slightly)

SAM! What a surprise!

SAM

(even more surprised)

Are you officer 412/L?

JACK

(shaking Sam's hand)

Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told

me you were coming aboard -

congratulations!

SAM

Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?

JACK

For my sins. Are you settling in

alright?

SAM

Yes, thanks.

JACK

Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped

by. Unfortunately, I don't have any

time right now I've got a queue of

customers to deal with - er, why

don't we have a drink tonight?

SAM

(diffidently)

Ah ...

JACK

What?

SAM

I don't want to take up your time

now, but I was hoping you could give

me some information on somebody. It's

a security level three matter and

Information Retrieval records says to

refer to you.

JACK

OK. Come back this afternoon, about

four o'clock. If you give me the

number of the case, I'll have the

dossier here waiting.

(he pulls card from his

pocket - pushes it towards

Sam)

My tailor,... well worth the

investment.

SAM

(taking print-out sheets

from his pocket)

I've got numbers all over these - I'm

not sure which is the one you want.

JACK

(looking at the print-out

picture of Jill over Sam's

shoulder)

Layton! Oh shit!

SAM

What is it?

JACK

You clever bastard! I might have

guessed. You only moved in today and

you're already hot on the bloody

trail.

SAM

JACK

SAM

How do you mean?

JACK

How much do you know?

SAM

Not much.

JACK

Enough though, eh?

SAM

(getting sucked into this

exchange)

Not really, no.

JACK

OK. OK. Let's not fence around ...

This is the situation. Some idiot

somewhere in the building, some

insect, confused two of our clients,

B58/732 and T47/215.

SAM

B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?

JACK

Christ! You do know it all!

SAM

No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning

Honestly. Sorry, carry on.

JACK

Well, your A. Buttle has been

confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle.

I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should

be shot for that. So B58/732 was

pulled in by mistake.

SAM

You got the wrong man.

JACK

(a little heated)

I did not get the wrong man. I got

the right man. The wrong man was

delivered to me as the right man! I

accepted him, on trust, as the right

man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to

the confusion, he died on us. Which,

had he been the right man, he

wouldn't have done.

SAM

You killed him?

JACK

(annoyed)

Sam, there are very rigid parameters

laid down to avoid that event but

Buttle's heart condition did not

appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think

I'm dismissing this business, Sam.

I've lost a week's sleep over it

already.

SAM

I'm sure you have

JACK

There are some real bastards in this

department who don't mind breaking a

few eggs to make an omelette, but

thank God there are the new boys like

me who want to maintain decent

civilized standards of terrorist

eradication. We've got the upper hand

for the moment, but they're waiting

for us to slip up, and a little slip-

up like this is just the chance

they're looking for.

SAM

So how ...?

JACK

What I've got to do now is pick up

Tuttle, interrogate him at the same

voltage as Buttle, to the same meter

reading to the last penny, and juggle

the books in electrical banking.

SAM

What has Tuttle done?

JACK

We suspect him of freelance

subversion.

SAM

(dumbly)

He's a freelance subversive?

JACK

He's a compulsive heating engineer. A

maverick ex-Central Service repair

man with a grudge against society.

Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of

the wood, I think. At least we will

be when I get this Layton woman under

arrest.

SAM

(agitated)

What's she done?

JACK

You didn't know as much about this

business as you pretended to, did

you?

SAM

Er ... no.

JACK

Very smart.

SAM

Er ... but I would've found out

anyway.

JACK

Yes. I'm impressed.

SAM

(playing the game)

Tell me about Layton.

JACK

She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the

Buttle arrest - and since then she's

been making wild allegations,

obviously trying to exploit the

situation - she's working for

somebody, and she's not working for

us.

SAM

A terrorist?

SAM

Ah ... thanks.

SAM

(hesitantly)

But surely, I mean, perhaps she just

happened to live above the Buttles,

and ...

JACK

(picking up photograph of

wife and kids from his

desk)

Look after that suit, eh. Barbara

chose it for me.

SAM

Right. Er, you're not going to keep

calling her Barbara, are you?

JACK

Barbara's a perfectly good name,

isn't it?

SAM

(preferring to let his

drop)

Look, about the Layton woman - maybe

she's just trying to help the Buttle

family.

JACK

Why?

SAM

Why? Hell, not for any reason ...

JACK

{baffled)

I don't follow you.

SAM

Out of kindness.

JACK

(utterly baffled)

Kindness? What's the purpose behind

this line of enquiry?

SAM

(deciding to abandon this

line of country)

So what are you going to do about

her?

JACK

Get her out of circulation - I've put

her on the detention list.

SAM

(thinking fast)

You mean you're going to invite her

in so that she can spill the beans

inside the department?

JACK

(taken aback)

Well, I ... Good point. What do you

suggest?

SAM

Let me try to get to her. I'll

deactivate her.

JACK

What does that mean? I don't want to

be involved in anything unsavoury.

SAM

Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?

JACK

Of course. We went to school

together. You're my oldest friend.

SAM

And you're mine.

JACK

You're the only person I can trust.

SAM

Then we'd better keep this business

just between the two of us.

JACK

Right! Just between as and the

Security Forces.

SAM

They weren't at school with us.

JACK

But, I've already put her on the

search and detain list.

SAM

Take her off the list.

JACK

There's no procedure for that until

she's been arrested.

SAM

Say it was a mistake.

JACK

We don't make mistakes.

SAM

Well, I'd better get out there and

try to get to her before security

does. Let me borrow her dossier for a

while.

JACK

Er ... alright. For Christ's sake

don't lose it. Here, you'd better

sign for it.

SAM

Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.

JACK

Do you know what you're doing.

SAM

(about to say no, then

pauses)

Trust me.

JACK

(admiring Sam's new look)

Sam ... we're proud to have you at

Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas.

executive package)

I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole

She's innocent, Jack --- she's done

nothing wrong.

Tell that to the wives of the

Security men she blew up this

afternoon. Listen, we've also had a

report just in from Central Services

that Tuttle has wrecked an entire

flat and sabotaged adjacent Central

Christmas Parcel for you, sir ...

sign here please ...

OFFICIAL A

93/HKS/608, you are charged with the

following:

Passing confidential documents to

unauthorized personnel - viz IR

dossier/Gillian Layton. Destroying

Government property - viz an

indeterminate number of personnel

carriers. Taking possession under

false pretences of said personnel

carriers. Forging the signature of

the Head of Records, Third

Department. Attempting to misdirect

Ministry funds, in the form of a

cheque to A. Buttle, through

unauthorized channels. Tampering with

Central Services supply ducts.

Employing unqualified suspected

persons for this purpose. Attempting

to conceal a fugitive from justice.

Obstructing the forces of law and

order in the exercise of their duty.

Giving aid and comfort to the enemies

of society.

Bringing into disrepute the good name

of the Government, and the standing

within the community of the

Department of Information Retrieval.

Attempting to disrupt the Ministry of

Information Retrieval's internal

communicating systems. Wasting

Ministry time and paper.

OFFICIAL B

We would advise you that a plea of

guilty will save you and the tax

payer money, and will always be

looked upon more favourably than a

plea of not guilty. All you are

requested to do at this stage is to

sign this form.

SAM

Where's Jill?

OFFICIAL A

Not interested?

SAM

What have you done with Jill?

OFFICIAL A

Right. Next!

SAM

(more hysterical)

Where's Jill? What's happened to

Jill?

OFFICIAL C

93/HKS/608, you've got quite a list

of misdemeanours here, haven't you?

All this is going to take time and

money, and I'm afraid, according to

your bank statement and credit rating

here, you're likely to be in deep

financial trouble by the end of it.

Now, either you plead guilty to say,

seven or eight of these charges,

which'll bring the costs down to

within your reach, or you can borrow

a sum to be negotiated, from us, at

very competitive rates. We can offer

you something at say, eleven and a

half per cent, over thirty years. But

you will have to buy insurance to

qualify for his scheme.

OFFICIAL D

All you have to do is to agree to

sign the appropriate boxes on these

forms. Yes or no?

SAM

I'm not guilty! Not guilty you stupid

bastar...

OFFICIAL E

(examining forms)

Now, since you've elected to plead

not guilty on all these charges,

you'd be well advised to take some

sort of insurance cover. Preferably

comprehensive, or if you'd prefer,

something more specific - say,

against electrical charges over

f70.00. And for food and

accommodation costs of say, 800.00.

Detention can be a very expensive

business.

OFFICIAL F

Now, before we bore you with the

small print perhaps you'd like to

tell us whether you'd like to sign

this insurance acceptance form or

not. Think carefully before you

decide. Thinking ahead in financial

matters is always the wise course.

OFFICIAL

We're here to save you and the tax

payer money.

OFFICIAL

Would you like to pay the premium for

a single room with a shower and a

soft bed?

OFFICIAL

For a small charge we can keep visits

from friends and relatives down to to

a minimum.

OFFICIAL

Plead guilty, it's easier, quicker,

and cheaper for everyone.

OFFICIAL

We're doing a survey ... Aimed at

providing a better service.

OFFICIAL

Do you think the present system is A.

efficient, B. inefficient?

OFFICIAL

As a taxpayer are you A. impressed,

B. unimpressed

rules of the game are laid down, and

we all have to play by them - even

me.

SAM

This is all a mistake! Don't you

understand?!

HELPMANN

Yes, well, from the Department's

point of view you're certainly a bit

of an own goal, but ...

SAM

I'm not a terrorist! You must know

that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of

here!

HELPMANN

Sam, if you've been going out there

and playing a straight bat, all the

way down the line, you've got

absolutely nothing to worry about.

SAM

Please, I've got to find Jill.

Sam, I think I ought to tell you ...

I'm afraid she's upped stumps and

retired to the pavilion.

SAM looks blank.

Thrown in the towel.

SAM

this out)

Dead?

HELPMANN

Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it

seems she was killed resisting

arrest.

SAM

(relieved)

No, no ... I did that...

HELPMANN

The odd thing is it appears to have

happened twice ... a bit of a

disputed call, I'm afraid.

HELPMANN

So, there you are. All I can say is,

don't fall at the last fence. The

finishing post's in sight. See you in

on the ball. Got to go .... Can't

keep the orphans waiting.

Don't fight it, son .... confess

quickly ... Before they get into the

We stood beneath an amber moon,

And softly murmured 'Some day soon'

We kissed and clung together,

With still a million things to say,

Now, when twilight beams the sky above,

Recalling thrills of our love,

There's one thing I'm certain of,

Return, I will,

To old Brazil."
