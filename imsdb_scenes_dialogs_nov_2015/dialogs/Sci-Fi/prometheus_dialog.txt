WATTS

Moving to survey site B... closing on

object four. The large oblong.

WATTS (CONT'D)

There you are.

WATTS

Martin. Here.

4.

HOLLOWAY

Look at that.

WATTS

You need to see this.

HOLLOWAY (V.O.)

Coming.

WATTS

Same thing again.

HOLLOWAY

What do you see?

WATTS

An ephemeris - a star map.

(POINTING)

Radius, inclination, azimuth...more

data here...

5.

HOLLOWAY

If we can get epoch and equinox out of

that...

WATTS

Can we raise this thing?

HOLLOWAY

(shakes his head)

Hundreds of tons.

HOLLOWAY

I have a solution. A single match.

WATTS

Me too. Checked it twice.

6.

HOLLOWAY

You first.

WATTS

What do we do now?

HOLLOWAY

We go there.

WATTS

What's first? You do climate, I do

genetics?

HOLLOWAY

Archaeology first. Let our ancestors

tell the tale.

WATTS

You think he's serious?

HOLLOWAY

Serious enough to send his private

shuttle.

WATTS

Weyland can send his shuttle out for

pizza.

(DELICATELY)

WATTS (CONT'D)

Martin. If this meeting goes like the

others, maybe we should...

HOLLOWAY

It won't go like the others.

WATTS

How do you know?

HOLLOWAY

Heaven smiles on our enterprise.

8.

DAVID

Professor Holloway. Dr. Watts. My name

is DAVID.

WATTS

Hello, DAVID.

DAVID

Mr. Weyland's eager to meet you.

EXHIBIT HALL

DAVID

These are all the planetary bodies on

which Weyland Industries has mining

claims.

DAVID (CONT'D)

And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel.

HOLLOWAY

How is that going? The terraforming.

WATTS

They say you're getting diminishing

returns. It's not working.

DAVID

It's the greatest engineering project

ever attempted. Challenges are

inevitable. Mr. Weyland's a

determined man.

WEYLAND'S OFFICE

9.

WEYLAND

Professor Holloway. Ms. Watts.

WATTS

Doctor Watts.

WEYLAND

Forgive me. Peter Weyland.

WEYLAND (CONT'D)

Ah. DAVID here's a prototype. Our 80

series. One of a kind for now, but if

he performs, he will be legion.

(his smile fades)

What do you want here?

HOLLOWAY

We sent you a prospectus that...

WEYLAND

Assume I know nothing.

HOLLOWAY

I'm an archaeologist.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

In my studies I discovered a pattern I

couldn't explain. Every eleven hundred

years, sudden advances in agriculture,

tool use, technology. Inventions.

Something caused a great leap forward.

Every eleven centuries. The pattern

holds as far back as our data goes.

(MORE)

10.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

Tens of thousands of years. I had to

understand this. It became the focus

of my work.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

Dr. Watts was a student of mine.

WATTS

I was analyzing historical changes in

human DNA. I found the same pattern.

Every eleven centuries, a pulse of new

information in the genome of the human

race. All over the world. Evolution

can't do that. Something was changing

us. Changing the DNA of our species.

HOLLOWAY

Humanity's been visited. Visited

by...beings from somewhere else.

VICKERS

You mean aliens.

WEYLAND

Lydia Vickers, Director of Operations.

Practically my right hand.

HOLLOWAY

They guided us to civilization. Lifted

us up, again and again. I call them

the Engineers.

WATTS

Once you know what you're looking for,

it's amazing how the evidence falls

into place.

11.

HOLLOWAY

This is the writing of the Engineers.

We've found it on every continent. And

last year, we found our Rosetta Stone.

WATTS

The writing is a formula giving the

location of a single star in our sky.

WEYLAND

Which star?

HOLLOWAY

We're keeping that confidential for

now. But that's where we want to go.

WEYLAND

You want me to pay for an interstellar

research expedition!

HOLLOWAY

It's a chance to be part of a

revolution in scientific...

WEYLAND

Don't sell me, professor. You've been

turned down by every university and

government agency under the sun.

Nobody's going to gamble that kind of

money on your hunch.

WEYLAND (CONT'D)

Nobody but me.

(HE GRINS)

I've read your research.

HOLLOWAY

That's impossible. Our research is-

WEYLAND

Quantum encoded on secure servers,

yeah. We have an A.I. division, you

should know. Doing impressive things.

(he leans across the desk)

I know which star you're wishing on.

WATTS

You're bluffing.

12.

WEYLAND

Zeta Two Reticuli.

WEYLAND (CONT'D)

You know how I got this rich? I ask

myself: what does God spend his time

doing? And I go and do that.

WEYLAND (CONT'D)

Biotechnology was good to me. Fusion

power. Lately doing well with gravity

systems.

WEYLAND (CONT'D)

But what's the first thing God did?

WATTS

He made the Heaven and the Earth.

WEYLAND

That's what I'm talking about. You

left out my favorite part. The piece

about Earth. DAVID.

DAVID

For eons, Earth's climate swung from

hothouse to ice age. Explosions of

life, then mass extinctions. But

twelve thousand years ago the swings

stopped. The Holocene Epoch began - a

period of anomalous tranquility. The

rise of civilization began only then.

HOLLOWAY

That's right.

WATTS

And that change coincides with a visit

by the Engineers. They didn't just

change us. They changed our world.

WEYLAND

That's the piece I mean. Engineering

Earth. God stuff.

13.

WEYLAND (CONT'D)

My people checked your science. They

say it's solid.

WEYLAND (CONT'D)

I'll give you your expedition. Ship

and crew, supplies, support. One

condition.

HOLLOWAY

What's that?

WEYLAND

You get the discovery. Control of the

site. But any technology you find?

Anything at all. That's mine.

WEYLAND (CONT'D)

You take DAVID with you. My eyes and

ears. And Vickers...you're going too.

HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT

DOWNS

Look at that.

KAMAROV

She wakes up slow.

HOLLOWAY (O.S.)

Get out of there!

STILLWELL

Just looking.

HOLLOWAY

Give us a moment, will you?

WATTS

I'm out of sorts. Sorry.

HOLLOWAY

Never worry.

16.

WATTS

My head's buzzing.

HOLLOWAY

You just slept two and a half years.

It'll pass.

WATTS

Like you've done this before.

HOLLOWAY

I've read all about it.

BRICK

Sleep okay?

WATTS

Yes, thanks...

GLASSE

Captain'll see you now.

JANEK

Zeta Two Reticuli was surveyed

already. A hundred years ago.

WATTS

By an unmanned probe. Very crude.

17.

JANEK

No Earthlike planets.

WATTS

No.

JANEK

So what are you looking for?

HOLLOWAY

Proof of the Engineers' existence.

WATTS

Confirmation of Professor Holloway's

theories would change everything.

There'd be science before Holloway and

science after.

JANEK

Your ticket. I'll put the ship where

you want. Run your scans.

HOLLOWAY

Captain, your crew's been up for a

week. We could've used the time. Why'd

you wait to wake us?

JANEK

Better for discipline.

(off their silence)

Men ship out as prospectors for one

reason: the percentage. Find a gold

mine or a habitable planet, and you're

set for life.

(he laughs bitterly)

But this contract says no percentage.

No bounty. Just triple pay. The men

aren't happy.

HOLLOWAY

You unhappy too?

JANEK

I'm always unhappy.

18.

SCIENTISTS' CABIN

WATTS

DAVID. I wondered when we'd see you.

DAVID

I trust your database is in order. I

set it up myself.

WATTS

All's well, I think.

DAVID

I should tell you: the time you spent

sleeping, I spent studying your

research.

WATTS

You studied our work for two and a

half years.

DAVID

It's quite a data set.

HOLLOWAY

So you've seen everything. Well. What

do you think?

19.

DAVID

Your hypothesis is...bold. The

audacity of it. Your climate data's

undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was

engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic

studies are equally conclusive. Pulses

of cultural change are harder to

prove, but even there your case is

strong. I believe in your "Engineers."

BREAK ROOM

HOLLOWAY

Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms.

Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

About the materials I gave you. Some

of the technical aspects...

CHANCE

We'll handle our end of the job.

RAVEL

If there is a job.

CHANCE

We only have a job if you find

something.

20.

CORRIDOR

VICKERS'S SUITE

WATTS

Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's

only ten of those things on Earth! I

guess nine, now.

VICKERS

I told Mr. Weyland I wouldn't

compromise my standard of living. He

accommodated me.

HOLLOWAY

I know, I had to cut my manifest. This

used to be the number four cargo bay.

VICKERS

What can I do for you, Professor?

HOLLOWAY

We're about to reach the system

periphery. I thought you'd want to see

the search protocols we -

VICKERS

No. I was set to be the next CEO of

Weyland Industries. Then you came

along and sold Mr. Weyland on...this.

So here I am. Out of the running.

I'll go where I'm told. But don't ask

me to play along.

WATTS

But when you get back...

21.

VICKERS

I'll be five years behind the curve.

Out of touch. Over.

HOLLOWAY

You might make the discovery of the

ages.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

You don't believe in what we're doing.

VICKERS

Mr. Weyland believes. That's enough.

VICKERS (CONT'D)

Now we're out of communication, you

can tell the crew what we're doing.

WATTS

They don't know? They volunteered.

VICKERS

They volunteered blind. Classified

job, triple pay.

CARGO BAY

DOWNS

Aliens.

GLASSE

You shitting me?

HOLLOWAY

I think all our mythologies are race-

memories of the Engineers. Horus the

Sun God. Prometheus bringing fire from

heaven. A pillar of fire, a pillar of

smoke. The Engineers are the gods.

22.

KAMAROV

The mythology gods maybe. God is God.

STILLWELL

Kamarov. Let him talk.

STILLWELL (CONT'D)

So we're going to meet these things?

WATTS

We probably won't meet anyone. You'd

expect a star-traveling race to

generate radio or laser signals.

Fusion drives and gravity drives have

clear signatures. But Zeta Two

Reticuli is silent. And the Engineers

have gone missing on Earth.

WATTS (CONT'D)

By the pattern, they should've come to

Earth seventeen centuries ago. And

again six centuries ago. But no sign.

After twelve thousand years...they

stopped coming.

BRICK

Why?

HOLLOWAY

Exactly. Why?

JANEK

"My God, my God, why have you forsaken

me?"

JANEK (CONT'D)

Is that the question you've come light-

years to answer?

HOLLOWAY

Only my first question. I have many.

23.

JANEK

Welcome to Zeta Two Reticuli. Edge of

the system. Open her eyes.

JANEK

Overlay.

DOWNS

Seven planets. Two hot rocks, two gas

giants, three snowballs. Nothing

Earthlike.

24.

WATTS

First humans in the system.

JANEK

Director. Good of you to join us.

VICKERS

What did I miss?

CAPTAIN JANEK

Just getting warmed up.

(TO HOLLOWAY)

Professor? You know what you want?

HOLLOWAY

EMR scan, thirty hertz to three

hundred gigahertz. Spectroscopic

passes on every planet and major moon.

Infrared and albedo scan for hot spots

and light sources.

CAPTAIN JANEK

Man knows what he wants. Run it.

TELESCOPE POV

GLASSE

Negative on radio chatter system-wide.

Nobody's talking.

25.

BRICK

Negative for laser and maser.

GLASSE

No biological markers. No artificial

light. No industry or agriculture.

Dead system. Like always.

DOWNS

Piss-poor, too. Low in heavy elements.

BRICK

Got a hit! A moon. LV-426.

BRICK (CONT'D)

Eighty-six percent Earth's mass.

Atmosphere's nitrogen, methane,

sulfates. Faint returns for a bunch of

metals.

HOLLOWAY

Anything else?

JANEK

That is all.

HOLLOWAY

Take us in.

JANEK

Downs. You heard the man.

DOWNS

Aye, Captain. Maneuvering.

Eighteen hours to orbit.

26.

PASSAGEWAY

HOLLOWAY

DAVID. Enjoy the show?

DAVID

I don't know that I "enjoy" things.

It was informative.

HOLLOWAY

It was, it was.

(TEASING)

You know, I've seen more convincing

humanoid robots.

DAVID

My design's not intended to convince.

Simulating humanity is a complex task

that diverts resources. My designers

dispensed with that burden to optimize

for intelligence.

WATTS

Why look like a man at all? Why not be

a box on wheels?

DAVID

Being shaped like you, I can use

spaces and equipment designed for you.

But I'm not so limited. I hear

frequencies you can't hear. I see

wavelengths of light invisible to you.

I move faster. Exert greater force.

WATTS

You see yourself as a superman.

DAVID

No.

DAVID (CONT'D)

Not a man at all.

27.

SCIENTISTS' CABIN

WATTS

What if they're really there?

(off his confusion)

The Engineers. They could be there.

Waiting for us. What then?

HOLLOWAY

Then all my dreams come true.

HOLLOWAY

Start with passive systems. We're

uninvited guests. Let's be quiet.

BRICK

A lot of electromag, all random.

That's lightning. Going to bugger up

our scans.

HOLLOWAY

Go active. Mapping radar.

28.

JANEK

Well, we just rang the doorbell, if

anybody's listening.

HOLLOWAY

What do we see?

BRICK

Icecaps at the poles. Frozen methane.

Cold down there.

GLASSE

Terrain data rezzing up. Hey! We got

hard spots. Radar-opaque. Bright

reflections. That's metal.

HOLLOWAY

That's not natural.

29.

MILBURN

You see stuff like that sometimes.

Mineral deposits. Volcanic ejecta.

GLASSE

Big one there.

HOLLOWAY

Still quiet?

BRICK

No comm signals. No signs of life.

HOLLOWAY

I want to get below the clouds.

30.

GLASSE

Coming up on site seven.

DOWNS

Nothing.

HOLLOWAY

Look there.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

Are we recording?

WATTS

Tungsten, tantalum, aluminum. That

could be technology.

HOLLOWAY

Let's see the next one.

31.

WATTS

Identical, apart from weathering.

MILBURN

Could be a rock formation. Carbon

crystallizes like that.

HOLLOWAY

Let's see the big one.

BRICK

Closing on the major site...

BRICK (CONT'D)

No radio. No heat sources. Cold as the

grave.

HOLLOWAY

Nobody home.

WATTS

I don't think anybody's been home for

a long time.

32.

HOLLOWAY

All right. Let's move.

JANEK

There's only six hours of daylight

left. Maybe you should hold off.

WATTS

We've got that outside the windows and

you want to wait `til tomorrow?

WATTS

The air here will kill you, so keep an

eye on your supply and watch your

seals. Pathogen tests are clean.

33.

HOLLOWAY

Move slowly. Stay together. Don't

touch anything. Things may be more

fragile than they look - or more

dangerous. There might be technologies

operating here we don't understand.

HOLLOWAY

Tell me that's a natural formation.

(HE GRINS)

Undeniable proof of alien

civilization. You were here on this

day, thirty-one December, year of our

Lord 2172. History will remember your

names.

34.

WATTS

The door's open.

JANEK

Son of a bitch. They were right.

RAVEL

It wasn't real.

MILBURN

We all saw it.

HOLLOWAY

Recording?

FIFIELD

No more. I'm out.

HOLLOWAY

Fifield. Get a grip.

FIFIELD

I'm a prospector. You find a load of

bauxite, I'm your man. But not this.

37.

MILBURN

I should go with him. Buddy system.

HOLLOWAY

(DISGUSTED)

Fine.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

You can deploy the drones. Drop them

in the first or second nexus on your

way back.

FIFIELD

Give us a rover.

HOLLOWAY

And half our gear? It's no more than a

mile. You can walk it.

HOLLOWAY

This should lead to the core of the

pyramid.

WATTS

Jack it open? Or cut through?

HOLLOWAY

Let's do as little damage as we can.

RAVEL

There's power. Current flowing in the

wall.

CHANCE

Maybe we can hack it. Has to be a

mechanism...

38.

DAVID

Pull up a rover. I want to get up

there.

JANEK

Director. Taking an interest?

VICKERS

It's my operation, isn't it?

FIFIELD

What do you think?

MILBURN

Grand Central Station.

FIFIELD

Let's check the feed. Gimme the map.

MILBURN

You had the map unit.

39.

FIFIELD

You don't have the map?

MILBURN

Are you serious?

MILBURN (CONT'D)

Come on.

DAVID

Looks like a three-state switch.

DAVID (CONT'D)

One moment...

RAVEL

This is something, now.

DAVID

Yes. Yes, it is.

Do you see, the size of them? Like

that ghost we saw...

HOLLOWAY

It wasn't a ghost. Where are the

others? I don't want to go back up.

WATTS

They switched to channel three. I hear

them talking. They're okay.

HOLLOWAY

We should stay together.

MILBURN

This is not the same place.

FIFIELD

It is! That is the same freaky thing

we saw before.

MILBURN

No it's not! The other one was more...

sort of...fuck it.

CHANCE

The size of them!

HOLLOWAY

In all the old mythologies, the

visitors from the sky were giants.

WATTS

They were killed. All of them.

DOWNS

We shouldn't be here.

HOLLOWAY

Come on. The dead can't hurt you.

(adjusts his communicator)

DAVID. Chance. Ravel. I've got

something here.

WATTS

Communications are going to hell.

JANEK

All hands. Back to the ship. We got a

mean storm front rolling in. I repeat.

All hands...

front rolling...back to the ship.

HOLLOWAY

(INTO COMM)

We've found something here! I'm not

walking away for bad weather.

JANEK

winds with airborne silica and enough

static to fry your suits. Get your

asses back here! Now!

WATTS

Help me unload!

WATTS

You don't want to know.

STILLWELL

Shit. We're two helmets short.

KAMAROV

They didn't come in!

JANEK

Between the wind speeds and the static

electricity, there's no safe way to

get to you. You're going to have to

hunker down until it passes. How are

your provisions?

FIFIELD (V.O.)

We got air . Water and food

tabs  suits.

JANEK

Honey sacks?

48.

FIFIELD

Yeah, we're piped.

MILBURN

I hate these fucking things.

FIFIELD (V.O.)

We hate these fucking ,

Captain.

JANEK

Maybe next time you'll mind your maps.

Keep your heads down. We'll come get

you in the morning.

JANEK (CONT'D)

Magellan out.

HOLLOWAY

My friends. What we do here marks the

greatest achievement of our species.

Contact with another civilization.

Humanity came of age today, on this

moon. You were there.

(raises his glass)

To history.

49.

JANEK

To Milburn and Fifield. The first

human beings to freak out, get lost,

and sleep in their suits in the ruins

of an alien civilization.

MILBURN

What are you looking for?

FIFIELD

(groping along the wall)

Someplace things can't come at us.

MILBURN

What's gonna come at us?

DAVID

The core of the pyramid. You see.

VICKERS

We're going to protocol two.

DAVID

I understand.

LABORATORY

50.

WATTS

Martin. Look.

WATTS (CONT'D)

They look like us.

HOLLOWAY

We look like them. Genesis 1:27. "And

God created man in his own image. In

his own image created He him."

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

It's breaking down.

WATTS

Formaldehyde!

51.

DAVID

Mortal after all.

VICKERS

Your cadaver's interesting. But I'm

more interested in the machinery in

the pyramid. The core chamber. What do

you think it does?

WATTS

How could anyone know...

HOLLOWAY

I know what it does.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

Think. What we've seen. What we know.

WATTS

Twenty-four pyramids scattered around

the moon's equator. Massive power

supplies. Vents in the walls.

Atmosphere changes. Breeder tanks...

(she's got it)

The pyramids are terraforming

machines.

HOLLOWAY

That's why Earth's ancient cultures

built pyramids: in imitation of the

gods.

(MORE)

52.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

Twelve thousand years ago, beings from

the sky set pyramids on the Earth and

transformed the world. That's what

they were doing here - before their

civilization failed.

WATTS

It didn't fail. It was wiped out.

MILBURN

Look at this!

FIFIELD

Jesus! Put it down!

MILBURN

Relax. Your suit's bug-proof. Hell,

it's bulletproof.

MILBURN (CONT'D)

That's enough.

53.

MILBURN (CONT'D)

(PANICKING)

Get it off! It's crushing me!

MILBURN (CONT'D)

AHH! Help me! Christ!

HOLLOWAY

You won't get anything. Tissue's too

degraded. Hmm. Brain chamber's

massive, even proportionately.

WATTS

Neural paths are still conductive.

54.

GLASSE

Incredible.

WATTS

Formaldehyde's killing the tissue.

HOLLOWAY

Did you record that?

WATTS

Of course.

WATTS (CONT'D)

The lens is where the phase shift

happens.

WATTS (CONT'D)

Glasse. I want to look through these

lenses. Can you seal them and do the

optical correction?

GLASSE

Got an idea about that.

55.

MILBURN

Cut off my arm. Cut off my -

FIFIELD

Jesus Christ!

FIFIELD

Fifield to Magellan. Come on, come on.

Anybody, seriously! God damn it!

FIFIELD (CONT'D)

Get off!

56.

FIFIELD (CONT'D)

Shit.

FLASH ON:

FIFIELD

WATTS

We found the gods. And they've been

murdered.

HOLLOWAY

You've pried too many arrowheads out

of old skulls to get squeamish now.

They've been dead what, eighteen

hundred years? Two thousand?

WATTS

What could kill them?

HOLLOWAY

Who knows?

(he laughs bitterly)

(MORE)

57.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

But I guess we know why they never

came back to us. Something killed them

off - back around the time of Christ.

Maybe He was one of them! A great

teacher, sent from Heaven? Jesus. The

last Engineer.

WATTS

Martin, stop!

HOLLOWAY

And you are...

VIGODA

Vigoda. Weyland Security detail.

WATTS

Where'd you come from?

VIGODA

Director's call to brief you on that.

I'm supposed to escort you to the

HOLLOWAY

Worksite?

VIGODA

Haven't been out yet. I understand

it's in some kind of pyramid.

VICKERS

I'm being careful. These new finds

give our work a new importance.

WATTS

You should have talked to us. Martin's

mission leader. That's in our

contract.

VICKERS

The second you found alien technology,

control of this mission reverted to

me. That's in your contract too.

VICKERS (CONT'D)

Mr. Weyland's pouring trillions into

Mars. He's spent a fortune building

ships like the Magellan to search for

colony planets. But Earthlike worlds

are vanishingly rare. The right

distance from the sun, the right

atmosphere, enough water...

VICKERS (CONT'D)

This is a technology to transform

worlds. He'll never give it up.

(she turns to face them)

And neither will I.

HOLLOWAY

The science must come first. You can

wait until we've documented...

VICKERS

You're standing on an alien world

courtesy of Weyland Industries. Be

grateful.

WATTS

What are they doing in there?!

Milburn. Fifield. You read me? Come

JANEK

We should be getting beacons off their

STILLWELL

Shielding in the walls?

BRICK

Suits could have failed.

JANEK

Both suits?

LOWER PASSAGE

WATTS

We found the tomb of the gods, and

brought grave-robbers right to the

door.

HOLLOWAY

Let them scratch. This find's too big

to ruin. There's two dozen pyramids on

this moon. Anyway, they're on the

wrong track. That's infrastructure.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

The core activity of the complex was

down here.

WATTS

Something different killed these.

SHADOWY COLONNADE

WATTS

Martin? Martin!

COLONNADE

STILLWELL

What happened to him?

DOWNS (O.S.)

Captain.

JANEK

Where's the rest of him?

64.

DOWNS

No sign.

JANEK

All right. We're done here. All hands

back aboard.

STILLWELL

What about Milburn?

JANEK

We can't bring the body aboard. God

knows what's in there. Bag him. We'll

put him in an ore hopper.

JANEK (V.O.)

(FILTERED)

Repeat, I have two men down. I'm

pulling my crew back to the ship. I'd

advise you to do the...

WATTS (V.O.)

Please, anyone...I need help. Martin's

missing.

JANEK (V.O.)

(FILTERED)

Watts. Where are you?

VICKERS

Captain Shepherd. Consider yourself

responsible for my personal security.

65.

JANEK

I've just lost a third of my crew. I'm

not sending any more men off into the

dark.

WATTS

We can't leave Martin out there.

JANEK

Get Vickers to lend you some soldiers.

WATTS

(FURIOUSLY)

She says "her forces are committed."

DAVID (O.S.)

I'll stay.

DAVID (CONT'D)

You'll be safe.

WATTS

Thank you.

JANEK

Put him in the number one ore hopper.

Get the scrubbers on in the airlock.

Sterilize everything.

MINUTES LATER

66.

DAVID

You and Holloway should work with me.

I'm learning amazing things. This

mechanism - the first layer uses

energy fields to catalyze chemical

reactions. The second can suspend the

strong and weak forces - transmuting

one element into another. The third

layer builds customized bacteria.

Seeds the air with them. It creates

life as a tool, to change worlds.

WATTS

I can't think about this now!

DAVID

You should.

(HE SIGHS)

I understand. You're emotional.

WATTS

I'm human.

DAVID

That's what I mean.

JANEK (V.O.)

(FILTERED)

Watts. We've got another storm front

coming in. Looks like it follows the

sunset line. If you're coming in you'd

better do it now.

67.

WATTS

(ANGRILY)

No.

DAVID

I see light.

WATTS

Janek, hang on...

WATTS (CONT'D)

We've got him!

(TO HOLLOWAY)

Martin! Where's your helmet?

HOLLOWAY

Broken. I fell. Little...disoriented.

I've just been...

DAVID

Here. I can do without this.

WATTS

Let's get you home.

68.

JANEK

I didn't think I'd see you again. You

know we lost two men.

HOLLOWAY

She told me. I'm sorry.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

I need to lie down. We'll size things

up in the morning. Fair enough?

JANEK

Of course.

PASSAGEWAY

WATTS

What happened to you?

HOLLOWAY

(QUIETLY)

Not here.

HOLLOWAY

Jocelyn. I saw something. God, my

mouth tastes like an old boot.

WATTS

What's this?

69.

HOLLOWAY

Neck-ring of my suit, I think. Fell on

it.

WATTS

What did you see?

HOLLOWAY

After my fall, I woke up walking.

Delirious. My helmet wasn't right. I

took it off. I was in and out. I just

wandered. I went up into a huge space

like a cathedral. And I found a model

of the galaxy. Floating in the air.

WATTS

Are you okay? You sound...

HOLLOWAY

This was real. My headset video is

wherever my helmet is...but my suit

tracker will show where I was.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

Listen. This star map had a marker

representing Earth. Very clear.

Another marker I'm sure represents

this moon. But there were others. At

least seven or eight more.

HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

The Engineers aren't from here. This

moon's just an outpost. Abandoned. But

if we follow that map, we may yet make

contact with a living civilization.

WATTS

Martin.

HOLLOWAY

The location of the Engineer worlds is

the real prize. Next to that,

Weyland's terraforming is chump

change. We need to get coordinates.

And keep them from the Company. We

have to play this smart.

70.

WATTS

All right.

HOLLOWAY

Two men dead...Vickers is jumpy. As

soon as she gets what she wants,

she'll take this ship home. We have to

move fast.

WATTS

We will. You all right?

HOLLOWAY

I'm fine, now.

I want to understand.

JANEK

All right! Listen up. I expect you all

JANEK (CONT'D)

We've got some kind of parasite aboard

ship.

VICKERS

I suggest you kill it.

DOWNS

There's a bright idea.

KAMAROV

Show us where it is, lady. We just

spent five hours looking for the damn

thing.

WATTS

We found Engineers who died like

Martin.

WATTS (CONT'D)

Explosive wounds in the chest.

Whatever killed Martin is the same

thing that killed the Engineers a

thousand years ago.

74.

STILLWELL

Jesus.

WATTS

But not all the Engineers died that

way. The others were torn apart.

Slashed to pieces.

JANEK

We're a modular ship. Self-contained

life-support and power in every

section. I say put the ship in orbit.

Vent every compartment to space. Sit

in vacuum at twenty degrees Kelvin for

a week. Kill anything.

DOWNS

Then what?

STILLWELL

Straight home, man.

VICKERS

This ship doesn't lift until our

work's done.

JANEK

Are you serious?

VICKERS

We spent years and billions of dollars

getting here. The technology we came

for is in our hands. We just need a

little more time.

JANEK

We're barely here three days and three

men dead!

VICKERS

They were careless.

JANEK

Careless!

Dr. Watts. I didn't expect you.

How did you do that?

Ah. You don't see.

(HE SMILES)

I call this ship the Juggernaut.

Chariot of the Gods.

DAVID (CONT'D)

This is the navigation computer, for

want of a better term. But it's much

more than that. It seems to hold the

observable universe in its memory.

WATTS

Their homeworld. Do you see where the

Engineers come from?

DAVID

There are safeguards on that data.

It's toward the galactic center.

Sagittarius Arm.

WATTS

DAVID. The creature that killed

Martin. There are thousands of them

under the pyramid. Hatcheries.

DAVID

I know.

WATTS

(SHOCKED)

Those things wiped out the Engineers

on this moon.

DAVID

I've succeeded in connecting with the

Juggernaut's systems, Dr. Watts. I

know a great deal today I didn't know

yesterday. I'm on the verge of

activating more systems. Archives.

WATTS

(HORRIFIED)

You're turning things on? This site

should be sealed. Evacuated.

DAVID

Would Holloway have walked away from

this? There's no greater work I can

imagine.

WATTS

It's too dangerous.

83.

DAVID

Only for the ignorant. Dr. Watts. I've

read your file. Your intelligence

scores are even higher than Professor

Holloway's. But he had a kind of

courage. An audacity of imagination.

If you could find that in yourself...

WATTS

If your owner gives you a direct

order, you have to obey. Don't you?

WATTS (CONT'D)

I can have Vickers pull you out.

DAVID

I was given two operating protocols

for this mission. I was to render you

every assistance - until you

discovered what Vickers would call a

"game-changing technology." I was

given a specific list. Then I was to

go to protocol two.

WATTS

What's protocol two?

DAVID

Under protocol two I was to make sure

that you and Holloway never spoke to

anyone about this place. Various

acceptable ways of making sure of

that. I was given a list.

DAVID (CONT'D)

You're all so stupid.

84.

VAULTED PASSAGE

DAVID

Stupid and slow.

WATTS

DAVID. What are you doing?

DAVID

Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna,

was also a bringer of death. Crushing

his worshippers under its wheels.

DAVID (CONT'D)

This ship has seven other cargo bays

like this one. The eggs in each bay

slightly different. They've been

weaponized.

DAVID (CONT'D)

I've seen the Juggernaut's flight

plan. Its destination was Earth.

Seventeen hundred years ago. This was

the ship that never came. This was its

cargo.

85.

WATTS

Stop!

DAVID

Perfect predators. Designed to kill

human beings. That's what the

Engineers were bringing to Earth. This

was a death ship.

DAVID (CONT'D)

I'm not what it wants. But you, with

your warm wet breath...it knows you.

WATTS

DAVID. No. No.

DAVID

The Engineers did their work too well.

And on this waystation moon, the

weapon they made destroyed them.

WATTS

Why would they make such things?

DAVID

To destroy their wayward children.

(INTONING)

"And the LORD said, I will destroy man

whom I have created from the face of

the earth...for it repenteth me that I

have made them." Genesis six seven.

JANEK

Why?

I threatened to make him leave.

VICKERS

What's he doing out there?

There's a ship under the pyramid.

DAVID calls it the Juggernaut. He's

inside it. Re-activating it.

The things that infected Martin and

me.

The Engineers made them to kill

humans. There are thousands of them on

Earth. That's what the Juggernaut is

for. To exterminate us.

GLASSE

We've got to get off this rock.

DAVID crippled the Nav computer. I'm

trying to lay a course in by hand.

Never done it. I'm not sure anyone

ever has on a ship like this. We can't

DAVID on that ship. We have to stop

him.

You're DAVID's owner. He has to obey

He's blocked my communications. He

can't hear me. Won't listen.

But if you went to him, turned on your

suit's loudspeakers, he'd have to hear

you. He'd have to obey.

So we go. Armed to the teeth and fast
