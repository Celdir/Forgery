"WAR OF THE WORLDS"

Screenplay by

NARRATOR

No one would have believed in the early

years of the21st century, that our world

was being watched by intelligences greater

than our own. That as men busied themselves

about their various concerns, they observed

and studied. Like the way a man with

a microscope might scrutinize the creatures

that swarm and multiply in a drop of

water. With infinite complacency men

went to and fro about the globe, confident

of our empire over this world. Yet,

across the gulf of space, intellects,

vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded

our plant with envious eyes. And slowly

and surely, drew their plans against

us.

SAL

Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!

SAL

I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00

I got half of Korea coming in.

RAY

No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour

blow! Call Tadesko.

SAL

Tadesko can't move 40 containers in

an hour. I need somebody who can do

double picks.

RAY

I wish I could help you Sal. God damn

union regulations.

SAL

(getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position

here!

RAY

Come on, you remember the union regulations,

Sal.

SAL

(angrily) You know what your problem

is?

RAY

(joking) I can think of a couple of

women who'd be happy to tell you.

RAY

Is it 8:30? We say that?

MARY ANN

We said 8:00.

RAY

(changing subject) Hey, this is one

safe looking vehicle you got yourself

here Tim. Congratulations.

TIM

Thank You.

RAY

8 o'clock huh?

MARY ANN

Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,

depending on the traffic.

RAY

There he is! You got a hug?

RAY

(continues) Confusing handshake? (joking)

Kick in the teeth? The door's locked.

(to Mary Ann): Still working on those

manners?

RACHEL

Hello dad.

RAY

Hello, Rachel!

ROBBIE

(during bickering, at the front door)

The door's locked.

MARY ANN

(suit case in hand) I'll just get it

in the door.

RACHEL

It's got rollers, just roll it.

MARY ANN

Well we can't roll it up the stairs

now can we?

RAY

Really, I got it from here, okay?

RAY

(to Tim) It's a 302 V8. It's gonna be

out of here next week.

RAY

(trying to get her to leave) You better

get going if you want to beat the traffic,

don't you think?

MARY ANN

You're out of milk. (smells it) And

everything else.

RAY

(mad) Would you close the door please?

Now that that's my refrigerator.

TIM

I'm gonna go wait outside. (to Rachel)

I love you sweetheart (hugs her) see

you in a few days.

RACHEL

Bye Tim.

MARY ANN

I'd better get this upstairs.

RACHEL

(trying to get her bag form Mary Ann)

Mom, Mom!

RAY

Mary Ann, let me get this.

MARY ANN

I can get it.

RAY

(rushes to close his bedroom door, as

if hiding something) Excuse me.

MARY ANN

A little old to still be sharing aren't

they?

RAY

I don't hear any complaints.

MARY ANN

No, I do.

MARY ANN

Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie

to make sure he's listening) ...on the

French occupation of Algeria due Monday

which he's yet to begin. It would be

nice if he were done by the time we

got back so we don't have to keep him

up all night on Sunday.

ROBBIE

I just got to type it up. (makes typing

motion)

MARY ANN

No, you just got to start writing it

first.

ROBBIE

(interrupts her) I love you mom!

MARY ANN

I love you. (begins walking over to

Rachel) Listen to your father.

MARY ANN

Oh, no shoes on the bed.

MARY ANN

We'll be at my parent's house in Boston

but don't call the house line, because

you know. Well the point is I've got

my cell phone. So if anything comes

up, or if you have any questions just

call.

RAY

Believe it or not, I can handle it.

MARY ANN

I'll leave the phone on.

RAY

Mary Ann? (beat) It's a good look for

you.

MARY ANN

You think?

RAY

Yeah.

MARY ANN

Take care of our kids.

RAY

Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about.

Listen, you tell your mother that Ray

sends his love and kisses.

MARY ANN

(laughs) She'll love that.

ROBBIE

Baseball season's over.

RAY

Five minutes. It's not going to kill

you.

RAY

There he is. (Robbie puts on his new

cap) Boston? (hesitating) That's how

it is? (no response from Robbie) That's

how it's gonna be?

RAY

Careful with that throw.

ROBBIE

Whatever Ray!

RAY

Your mom says you've got a report due

on Monday, so you are going to work

on that when you're done here.

ROBBIE

Yeah, I'm almost finished, I just got

to type it up.

RAY

Yeah, bullshit!

ROBBIE

Yeah, and what do you know Ray?

RAY

Everything. Haven't you heard? Between

me and my brother, we know everything.

RACHEL

What's the capital of Australia?

RAY

That's one my brother knows.

ROBBIE

Is it okay with you if I just laugh

the first 500 times you tell that one.

RAY

Just do your report. We don't send you

to school so you can flunk out.

ROBBIE

You don't pay for it, Tim does.

RAY

That's half of what I've got.

ROBBIE

You're an asshole. I hate coming here.

RAY

That why you act like such a dick?

RAY

What?

RACHEL

That's not how you're going to get through

to him. You want him to listen to you...

RAY

(interrupts her) What are you? Your

mother or mine?

RACHEL

Where are you going?

RAY

To sleep. I work for a living.

RACHEL

What are we supposed to eat?

RAY

You know, order.

RAY

What's the matter?

RACHEL

I got a splinter.

RAY

Where'd you get it. Come here.

RACHEL

On your porch railing.

RAY

What, you want me to... (beat) You want

me to take that out for you?

RACHEL

Absolutely not!

RAY

Well, come here let me see it.

RAY

It's gonna get infected.

RACHEL

No it wont.

RAY

Yes, it's gonna get infected.

RACHEL

No, it won't. When it's ready, my body

will just push it out.

RAY

Push it out?

RACHEL

I read that. (as she sits back down)

You should get TiVo. Tim got it for

my room. It's awesome. I can watch all

my shows after homework.

RAY

Yeah, I'll just put that on my platinum

card. Robbie? (no response) Robbie?

RAY

(with the disgusting food in his mouth)

What is that?

RACHEL

Hummus.

RAY

Hummus?

RACHEL

From the health food place. I kept one

of their menus last time we were here.

RACHEL

Uh, you said order!

RAY

(laughs) I meant order food! Where is

Robbie?

RACHEL

He went out.

RAY

Out where?

RACHEL

I don't know. He just took your car

and left.

FRIEND 1

You ever see something like that?

RAY

(scratching his chin) In the springtime

maybe. Not this time of year. Come on,

we can see better from the back yard.

RAY

That is so weird.

FRIEND 2

What?

RAY

The wind is blowing toward the storm.

FRIEND 2

That is weird.

RAY

Rachel, wanna see something cool?

Rachel rushes down the stairs to his side and hugs him in fear.

Pan up to view the 'storm' that appears to be lighting up with

multiple colored lights. Wide angle shot of clothes blowing in

the wind. Suddenly the wind dies down to nothing. Lightning hits

the pavement about 300 feet away.

RAY

It's okay.

RACHEL

I want to go inside.

RAY

It's okay.

RACHEL

I want to go inside.

RAY

Okay, you go ahead.

FRIEND 2

That's enough weather for me. (begins

walking inside)

RACHEL

I don't want to go by myself.

RAY

Kind of fun, ain't it?

RACHEL

No.

RAY

Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of

July.

RACHEL

No it's not.

RAY

It's okay. You're fine.

RACHEL

It hit right behind our house.

RAY

Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there

again because lighting doesn't strike

twice in the same place.

RAY

Oh, SHIT!

RACHEL

Where's Robbie?

RAY

I don't know.

RACHEL

Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you

okay?

RAY

Where's the thunder?

RACHEL

Why won't it stop?

RACHEL

(with hesitation) Is it over?

RACHEL

Where are you going?

RAY

Just checking things out. Just wait,

wait there.

RACHEL

Are we going to be okay?

RAY

I don't know.

RACHEL

You don't know.

RAY

No. I meant... Rachel, please, just

stop asking so many questions. Just

wait here.

FRIEND 2

You believe this Ray? Every single car.

RAY

(worried) Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

ROBBIE

The car just stopped and...

RAY

(interrupts him) You're okay? Are you

okay?

ROBBIE

... and the lighting started hitting

about a block away over and over again.

And me and this other guy we...

RAY

(getting angry) Where the hell'd you

go?

ROBBIE

Over on Lincoln Avenue. (break) ...

by the church.

RAY

Did you see it? Did you... Were you

near it?

ROBBIE

Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and

over the lighting started hitting. It

opened up this hole or something...

RAY

26 times?

ROBBIE

Yeah.

RAY

Okay, well, you're okay?

ROBBIE

Yeah.

RAY

Good, because your sister is in the

house, I want you to go in that house

and I want you to stay with her. Okay?

(break, as he starts running down the

street) And the next time you take my

car with no driver's license and no

permission, I call the cops. You better

be there when I get back.

RAY

Robbie. (snaps his hands together)

RAY

Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it,

dead?

MANNY

All of them, everything, look at this...

(taps the starter motor) starter's fried.

RAY

Lightning hit it?

MANNY

Not even close. I thought if I changed

it... you got any idea what's going

on?

RAY

I'm on my way to find out. Try umm...

try changing the solenoids.

MANNY

Right, (to accompanying mechanic) Right

see, I told you that, the solenoids.

COP 1

Let us through. Let us through here.

FRIEND 3

Hey, what up, Ray?

RAY

(joking) I should of known you two were

behind this.

FRIEND 3

Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor

hood

RAY

Can you blame him?

FRIEND 4

You see it?

RAY

Yep, you got power where you are?

FRIEND 3

Nope, nothing.

RAY

It's the cars though. That's the thing.

FRIEND 4

Solar Flare, that's what this guy told

me.

RAY

A solar flare?

FRIEND 4

Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma,

they turn into solar flare flashes.

It's the only thing that can kill all

of the electronic stuff.

FRIEND 3

Can I say something?

FRIEND 4

What bro?

FRIEND 3

The sun does not cause lightning, okay?

FRIEND 4

Bro, I'm just telling you what that

guy said he heard.

FRIEND 3

I know but it just sounds dumb saying

that...

COP 1

I never seen anything like this before.

That many strikes of lighting in one

spot.

RAY

Is this the only place?

FRIEND 4

Is it hot?

RAY

No. It's freezing.

COP 2

What is that?

RAY

You feel that?

FRIEND 3

Yeah, I feel that.

FRIEND 4

What is it the subway?

COP 1

There's no subway here.

FRIEND 4

PATH Train maybe?

COP 1

That can't be the water main.

COP 2

There's nothing else down there.

COP 1

The water main doesn't run through here.

COP 2

Well, there's something down there and

it's moving.

FRIEND 4

Oh my god.

FRIEND 4

Ray, no, stay man.

ROBBIE

What happened?

RACHEL

What's going on?

RACHEL

Dad, what's the matter?

ROBBIE

What's all that stuff all over you?

Rachel reaches through a leg of the

island to pull at Ray's hood on his

shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his

head toward Rachel fast enough to make

some of the white powder poof off as

if jerked back into reality. Robbie

jumps as well in fright.

RACHEL

What's all the stuff?

ROBBIE

Hello? Ray?

RAY

We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

ROBBIE

(questioning) What? Wait. I have no

idea what's going on...

RAY

(while Robbie asks) ... all the food

from the refrigerator and the cupboard,

put it in here.

ROBBIE

I think we are having a bit of a shock

here...what's going on, just tell me...

RAY

Just do it.

RAY

Rachel, sweetheart...

RACHEL

Dad, you're really scaring me.

RAY

I need you to get your suitcase...

RACHEL

Dad. (break) Dad!

RAY

The one that you brought, bring it to

me, okay?

RAY

Can you do that for me, darling?

ROBBIE

What's happening?

RAY

Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now. We...

We've only got about another minute.

RAY

Please, Please, Please.

RAY

Just keep it down.

ROBBIE

Ray, I'm standing right beside you.

Can you please answer me?

RAY

Just get in the front seat Robbie.

RACHEL

Who's car is this?

RAY

Just get in.

RACHEL

Who's car is this?

MANNY

Hey, Hey, Ray! You were absolutely right.

I had to change the sole... Ray?

MANNY

Hey Ray? Ray? What?

MANNY

Ray. Open up.

MANNY

Open the door, come on! OPEN THE DOOR

RAY!

MANNY

What are you...

RAY

(interrupts him) Get in.

MANNY

That's funny, you gotta get out of the

car. You can't take it.

MANNY

It's not my car. It's not your car.

Where you going? Daddy's acting crazy

kids. Guy's gonna come back...

RAY

(interrupts him) I don't have time to

expl....

MANNY

(interrupts him) You're busting my chops.

I got a shop to run. You know how many

people...

RAY

(interrupts him) Get in!

MANNY

No, RAY GET OUT OF THE...

RAY

GET IN MANNY OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE!

RACHEL

What do you mean?

MANNY

All right, get out of the truck! I'm

not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR

RAY!

MANNY

I'm not fooling around, I got a busy

day ahead of me...

RAY

(to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT!

MANNY

RAY! BRING THE CAR BACK RAY! IT'S NOT

MY CAR!

RAY

GET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN!

RACHEL

Is this the terrorists?!?!

RAY

JUST GET DOWN. GET DOWN!

RAY

GET DOWN!

ROBBIE

HOLY SHIT!

ROBBIE

Where are we going?!?!?!

RAY

We gotta go! We got to be the only working

car around here. I'm not stopping until

we are clear.

ROBBIE

CLEAR OF WHAT?!?!

RAY

We gotta go.

ROBBIE

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!?!?!?

RAY

YOU SAW! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!

ROBBIE

BY WHO? WHO IS ATTACKING US?!?!

RAY

Rachel... Rachel you've got to keep

it down Rachel!

RAY

Rachel! SHUT UP RACHEL! I CAN'T THINK!

ROBBIE

(with a vein driven face) YOU ARE FREAKING

HER OUT!!

RAY

WELL, LOOK, I'M DRIVING, DO SOMETHING!!!

ROBBIE

Okay, (slapping his arms together on

top of each other, demonstrating) Put

em' up Rache.

ROBBIE

Make the arms. (he grabs her elbows

so she holds the position. He begins

to calm her down) This space right here,

this is yours.

ROBBIE

... This belongs to you, right?

RACHEL

(panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes...

ROBBIE

(reassuring her) You're safe in your

space.

RACHEL

(keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my

space.

ROBBIE

(reassuring her) You're safe in your

space. Nothing is going to happen to

you in your space.

RACHEL

I'm really scared.

ROBBIE

I'm gonna go to the front seat to talk

to dad...

RACHEL

No....

ROBBIE

(reassuring her) I will be two feet

away. Okay.

ROBBIE

Will you hold my hand?

RACHEL

Yes.

ROBBIE

Are you gonna be okay?

RACHEL

(relatively calm) Yes.

ROBBIE

(taking a breath to calm himself) I

want to know everything you know.

RAY

This thing, this machine, it crawled

out of the ground and started torching

everything, just killing everybody.

ROBBIE

What is it? (break) Is it terrorists?

RAY

No, this came from some place else.

ROBBIE

You mean like Europe?

RAY

NO ROBBIE!! NOT LIKE EUROPE!!!

RAY

That machine, it was already buried.

RAY

Maybe it came down in the lightning

storm.

ROBBIE

Wait a minute... you just said it was

buried.

RAY

No, the machine I'm talking about was

buried. But, what came down in the lighting

storm, what operates it. That's the...

that's the.... You know. The....

RACHEL

The what?

ROBBIE

Why aren't there any helicopters or

airplanes?

RAY

Hey Rache. How you doing there girl?

(to Robbie) How she doing?

ROBBIE

How you doing?

RACHEL

I'm fine.

ROBBIE

(to Ray) She's good.

RAY

Good.  Hey, what was that thing you

did with her?

ROBBIE

Works sometimes. She gets claustrophobic.

RAY

Hey Rachel

RACHEL

I want mom.

RAY

I know. You feel better?

RACHEL

I want mom.

RAY

Yeah, tell me about it, you know?

RACHEL

Take me to Mom's!

RAY

Listen, I just need you to hold it together

for me, okay?

RACHEL

I WANT MOM!!!

RAY

When you start screaming like that,

you know, I can't really...

RACHEL

TAKE ME TO MOM!!!

RAY

I know...

RACHEL

TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!

RAY

That's where we're going right now.

RACHEL

TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!

RAY

I KNOW!!

RACHEL

Come on, hurry up Dad...

RACHEL

Robbie, get the door.... (she knocks

on it)

RACHEL

(begins, and continues once in the house)

MOM! TIM!!

ROBBIE

(begins, and continues once in the house)

MOM!! TIM!!

ROBBIE

They're gone.

RACHEL

Is she dead??

RAY

She's not dead. All right? She's just

no here. Okay? They're never here.

ROBBIE

How do you know?

RAY

Because they are on their way to Boston....

RAY

... and so they just kept on going,

they're probably up to your grandma's

house by now.

ROBBIE

(dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her.

RACHEL

How come the lights are on here and

not at your place?

RAY

Umm.... Because nothing bad happened

here. Okay?

RAY

So, were safe here. All Right?

RAY

Okay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay,

you are safe in your area...

RACHEL

Dad. That's not how it goes.

RAY

Okay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get

you some food. I'm gonna feed you. Get

something to eat.  (digs into the box)

What do we have here??

ROBBIE

.. Busy signals, one of the fast ones....

You think all the circuits are down?

RAY

(continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco,

Barbeque Sauce. This is really good

Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food.

What... What the hell is this?

ROBBIE

That's all that was in your kitchen.

RAY

Okay. No, it's all right, it's all right.

RAY

Uh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the

bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm....

We'll just get some sandwiches.

RAY

You ever see me deal? Wanna see me deal?

Okay, there's two for you, two for Robbie,

two for me, (he has one extra in his

hand) ...one for the house. (laughs)

RAY

Maybe after we get done eating, I will

take you down, teach you how to play

some poker. A little five card stud...

a little blackjack...

RACHEL

I'm allergic to peanut butter.

RAY

(laughs) Since when?

RACHEL

(with a snotty look) Birth!

RAY

Okay, well, umm, here (hands her two

pieces of bread) You can eat the bread.

Okay?

RACHEL

I'm not hungry.

RAY

Okay, well. Robbie and I are going to

be eating peanut butter sandwiches.

(to Robbie) You want jelly on this sandwich?

ROBBIE

I'm not hungry either.

RAY

You're not hungry either? Well, that's

fine.

RAY

Everybody just relax, okay? Because

we are here now and we're safe, and

we're gonna stay.  And in the morning

your mom and Tim are going to be here

and everything's gonna be fine. Okay?

(no responses) Okay.

RACHEL

If everything's fine, why do we have

to sleep in the basement. We've got

perfectly good beds.

RAY

It's like a slumber party.

ROBBIE

What are you afraid is gonna happen

to us?

RAY

(walks over to the weight room corner

of the basement) Nice basement.

RACHEL

I want to sleep in my bed. I've got

back problems.

RAY

Okay. You know on the Weather Channel

when there's a tornado, and they tell

you to go to the basement for safety?

It's like that.

RACHEL

There's gonna be tornadoes?

RAY

Rachel, no more talking.

RACHEL

Could you be a little nicer to me. God!

ROBBIE

Wanna stay here?

RACHEL

Yeah. Good night, love you.

ROBBIE

Love you, Rache.

RACHEL

Is the lighting back?

RAY

No, this is something else...

ROBBIE

(screams) AHHHH... WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

RAY

I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE!!!

RACHEL

IS IT THEM!!! IS IT THEM!!!

RAY

WE GOTTA GO!! WHERE DO WE GO??? ROBBIE,

THIS IS YOUR HOUSE, WHERE DO WE GO??

RAY

WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!!

RACHEL

Are we still alive?

RAY

Down here!

RAY

Were you on this plane? Are you a passenger?

MAX (NEWS CAMERA OPERATOR)

Hey, how you doing? Wanna help me open

this?

RAY

Are you a passenger?

NEWS REPORTER

He's deaf. The shell went off right

beside him. The camera on his shoulder

saved his life. (to Max) You hear that

Max? Your stupid camera saved your stupid

life.

RAY

Where were you?

NEWS REPORTER

Out there in the pine barrens. We were

attached to a National Guard unit, the

83rd Mechanized. They moved to one of

those things around midnight. They've

got some kind of shield around them.

We can't see it, but everything we fire

at them detonates too early before we

can get close enough to cause any damage.

When they flash that thing, everything

lights up like Hiroshima.

RAY

There's more than one?

REPORTER

You gotta be kidding me right?

REPORTER

We were feeding New York but New York

went dark. So we patched over to D.C.,

they went down, L.A., Chicago, uplink

to London. Even called the affiliates

to try and get them to catch the feed,

but nobody answered.

REPORTER

It's the same everywhere. Once the tripods

start to move, no more news comes out

of that area.

RAY

Oh, my god!

REPORTER

You ain't seen nothing yet.

RAY

I saw that storm. I was right in the

middle of one of those.

REPORTER

No, you didn't see it like this. Those

machines come up from under the ground,

right? That means they must have been

buried there a long time ago. So who's

driving the god damn things? (pointing

to the monitor) Watch the lightning.

Watch it..... Watch the lighting.....

RAY

What is that?

REPORTER

That is them. They come down in capsules,

riding the lighting into the ground

into the machines right?

DRIVER

You hear that? We're getting the hell

out of here.

DRIVER

Come on! Get in! Get in! Get in!

REPORTER

Hey. Were you on that plane?

REPORTER

Oh, that's too bad, it would have been

a really great story.

RAY

Look at me. Look at me.

RAY

You keep your eyes only on me, you understand?

RAY

Don't look down, don't look around me.

I'm taking you to the car and you're

gonna want to look around. But you are

not going to, are you?

RAY

You're doing good. You're doing good.

Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right

to Boston, and we're gonna see your

mom.

RACHEL

I'm not gonna look, dad.

RAY

That's a girl. That's my girl.  Okay,

listen, I want you to close your eyes.

Got them closed?

RACHEL

Um-Huh.

RAY

There you go. Keep em' closed for me.

RAY

Robbie, get in.

RAY

ROBBIE!! GET IN!!!

RACHEL

Why are you yelling?

RAY

(to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get

in!

ROBBIE

Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?

RAY

Because I don't want everybody to see

we've got a working car. (going over

the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson

until we find an open bridge or ferry,

then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then

take the back roads across Connecticut

all the way to Boston.

RACHEL

Where is everybody?

RAY

I don't know. Running, hiding, hiding

in their basements.

ROBBIE

If we had any balls, we'd go back there

and find one of those things and kill

it.

RAY

Yeah, well, why don't you just let me

make the big decisions, okay?

ROBBIE

Which would be when? Never Ray? Never's

about your speed.

RACHEL

Okay, enough Robbie!

RAY

(angrily) Okay! Enough with the Ray

shit!! It's dad, sir, or if you want

Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird

to me but you decide.

RACHEL

Dad?!?!

RAY

Yes, Rachel.

RACHEL

I have to go to the bathroom.

RAY

Really?

ROBBIE

Come on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which

Ray has a hold of) I gotta go!

RAY

Not so fast, not so fast, all right?

Now, there are two things we have to

watch out for, and the second is people

who might want our car.

ROBBIE

There's nobody around!

RACHEL

I gotta go.

RAY

(displeased) Rachel! Rachel, that's

good right there. (points to a spot

20' away)

RACHEL

HARLAND

Hurry!!

HARLAND

(to Rachel) You all right?

HARLAND

(to Ray) And what about you?

RAY

(while Harland moves the wheel barrel)

(to Rachel) There you go. Is that comfortable?

I need you to close your eyes now, okay?

You need some sleep.

RACHEL

Dad?

RAY

He's gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie's gonna

meet us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma's.

RACHEL

(about ready to cry) What do you think

mom's doing right this minute?

RAY

Mom? She's in Boston. Waiting. And I

know she's not sleeping 'cause she is

so worried about you. (trying to comfort

her) ... And she's in grandma's kitchen,

and she's making that awful tea that

she makes. And they're all just... ...

...there all just counting the minutes

until they see you again.

RAY

(picking up the ribbon) What is this?

What... What is this?

RACHEL

I won.

RAY

You won?

RACHEL

The walk, trot, and canter. Third place.

RACHEL

Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"?

RAY

(shakes his head in displeasure because

he can't think of it) I don't remember

that one.

RACHEL

Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?

RAY

I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one

either.

RAY

(begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby.

So don't put me down. Because I've got

the fastest set of wheels in the town.

Something comes up to me that don't

even try....

RAY

(continues singing) ... If I had a set

of wings, man, I know she could fly.

She's my little deuce coupe. You don't

know what I've got... just my little

deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't

know what I've got....

HARLAND

Peach schnapps.

HARLAND

Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole

case of this shit.

RAY

Thank you.

HARLAND

I'm sorry about your son.

RAY

We got separated... he's gonna meet

us in umm... in Boston.

RAY

Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did

you loose anybody?

HARLAND

All of them.

HARLAND

(introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy.

RAY

(introduces himself) Ray Ferrier.

HARLAND

I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks.

You're welcome to stay, both of yous.

RAY

I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep.

HARLAND

(speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause)

Those machines, those tripods they got...

They buried them... right under our

feet. Since before there were even people

here. They've been planning this for

a million years. We're beat to shit.

RAY

Please, my daughter.

HARLAND

Think about it.    ...    They defeated

the greatest power in the world in a

couple days. Walked right over us.

....    And these are only the first,

they'll keep coming. This is not a war

any more than there's a war between

men and maggots. This is an extermination.

HARLAND

(feeling he's not grasping the reality)

Are you afraid?

RAY

Of course I am.

HARLAND

(going on) I been around death plenty.

Drive an ambulance in the city. Well,

drove and ambulance in the city. That's

all over now, huh?    ....   You know

the people who make it Ray? The ones

that don't flatline before the hospital?

It's the ones who keep their eyes open,

keep looking at you, keep thinking.

....    There the ones who survive...

....   We can' t loose our heads

Ray.   ....   Running, that's what'll

kill you.    ......     I'm dead set

on livin'.

HARLAND

Hah. Dead set on Living.

RAY

Thank you for taking us in.

HARLAND

We're not going to be exterminated.

HARLAND

(with shotgun at side) It's okay! Come

on, I wanna show you something!

HARLAND

We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta

have a weakness. Come on, take a look.

HARLAND

Somehow they killed a few of these things

in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling

me the Japanese can figure it out but

we can't?

HARLAND

We can do it. We can get 'em. We can

figure it out.

RAY

Stay right there!

RAY

I have a daughter! Why did you bring

us here?

HARLAND

To fight 'em together, Ray.   ....

Now we'll be the ones coming up from

underground. When the time is right,

we'll take 'em by supries, the way they

took us. We'll take 'em by surprise.

HARLAND

We're right under their feet, Ray. Right

here, under their feet.

HARLAND

You miss your mommy? I had a little

girl nearly your age. You know, if anything

happens to your daddy, I'll take care

of you.

RAY

Rachel!

RAY

(distinctly angry, but not yelling)

You don't have anything to say to her,

do you understand? If you want to talk

to somebody, or ask somebody a question,

you ask me!

HARLAND

(also angry at Ray) What exactly is

your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna

do. How about you? You gonna sit here,

wait for them to come get you? Is that

your plan?

HARLAND

Maybe you want to get caught. Couple

of days hiding in a basement too much

for you, I bet. You'll probably turn

yourself right in!

RAY

Listen. It stopped.

HARLAND

(paying no attention) Maybe you'll be

okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll

train you as their pet. You know, train

you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks...

RAY

(yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!

RAY

(dead silent) Give me that!

HARLAND

You and I... I don't  think we are on

the same page.

HARLAND

RAY!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!!

RAY

KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!!! QUIET!!!

HARLAND

(repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My

Blood!!!

RAY

Stop it! Stop it! You gotta stop it!

You gotta be quiet or they'll hear you!

HARLAND

(with an insane expression and tone)

They drink us!

RAY

Please, they'll hear you!

HARLAND

Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!

RAY

You gotta be quiet!

HARLAND

Drink US and....

RAY

They're gonna come back down here!

HARLAND

Then they spit us out all over their

goddamn red weeds!

RAY

(no longer whispering) Do you understand

what I'm gonna have to do? I can't let

my daughter die because of you.

HARLAND

This tunnel will get us to the city.

We'll have our own tunnels there. Ready

Made! Subway, see what I'm saying!

RAY

Stop it!

HARLAND

You can hide a whole army down there!

RAY

Stop it!!

HARLAND

... We'll go underground!

RAY

STOP IT!!!

HARLAND

Sneak attacks at night!

RAY

YOU STOP IT!!!

HARLAND

We're the resistance Ray! They can't

occupy this country! Occupations always

fail! History's taught us that a thousand

times. This is our land.

HARLAND

(continues) ... We eat it, we breathe

it, only we can live on it! They can't

survive here Ray. They weren't built

for it.

RACHEL

What are you doing?

RAY

Whatever you hear... don't take this

off.

RACHEL

Dad??

RAY

Rach?

RACHEL

Dad?

RAY

What was that song... that lullaby I

didn't know?

RACHEL

Hushabye Mountains

RAY

Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it.

RACHEL

(begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze....

RAY

Don't stop.

RACHEL

... On Hushabye Mountain...

RAY

That's my girl.

RACHEL

... For far away my baby goes...

RACHEL

... it fills the sails ...

RACHEL

... of boats that are waiting ...

RACHEL

... Waiting to sail your worries away

...

RACHEL

... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye

Mountain ...

RACHEL

... Wave goodbye to the cares of the

day and watch your boat, from Hushabye

Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby

Bay.

RACHEL

(screams) AHHHH!!!

RAY

Rachel???

RAY

RACHEL!!!  (to himself) Oh, my god,

RAY

Rachel? Rachel? (looks up the stairs)

RAY

SOLDIER 3

I don't know, something's happening

to them. Please keep moving.

RAY

Something's happening to them?

SOLDIER 4

Go. Go. Just keep moving, sir.

RAY

Excuse me, excuse me, what happened

here? You guys take it down?

SOLDIER 5

No sir, it was behaving erratically,

walking in circles then it went down

on it's own about an hour ago. (to people)

Now let's keep moving, don't stop do

not stop! Keep moving!

RACHEL

How is it dead all by it's self?

RAY

Rachel, I'm not sure.

RAY

(to a soldier, during the robot noise)

LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!

SOLDIER 6

I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!

RAY

LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!

SOLDIER 6

I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!

RAY

(louder) LOOK AT THE GOD DAMN BIRDS!!!

RAY

NO SHIELDS!!!

SOLDIER 6

(motions and says) I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!

RAY

(pointing) NO SHIELDS!!!

SOLDIER 6

(now getting it) (to the soldiers) THE

JAVELIN'S THE KEY! LOAD THE GUSTAV,

IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH KILL!!! LET'S

RAY

(to the people in the tunnel and Rachel)

It's safer in here!

SOLDIER 6

SOLDIER 6

IT'S CLEAR!

RACHEL

MOM!!!

MARY ANN

RACHEL

Robbie?

ROBBIE

Hey dad!

NARRATOR

From the moment the invaders arrived,

breathed our air, ate and drank, they

were doomed. They were undone, destroyed,

after all of man's weapons and devices

had failed, by the tiniest creatures

that God and his wisdom, put upon this

earth. At the toll of a billion deaths,

man had earned his immunity, is right

to survive among this planet's infinite

organisms. And that right is ours against

all challenges, for men do not live

nor die in vein.
