Fifteen minutes to delivery.

The camera descends as the boat passes, and dives beneath

The droning of engines becomes less pronounced. Foam

PILOT

What's happening?

SERBIAN 2

What happened?

SERBIAN 1

We've been hit. We're taking on water.

SERBIAN 1 (CONT'D)

Grab the professor, quick!

3.

SERBIAN 1

Something must be below us! Shoot! Shoot!

SHANE

Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States

Navy. I'm gonna get you outta here. But

you have to do exactly what I say, when I

say it. My way -- no highway option. Do

you copy?

(Plummer nods, terrified.)

Where's the briefcase?

PLUMMER

How did you know where I...

4.

SEAL

KEEP SHOOTING!

SEAL (CONT'D)

Give it a second, they're almost out of

ammo.

SEAL (CONT'D)

Now Lieutenant. Chopper's four meters at

your 10 o'clock.

SHANE

(into his mic)

I've got the Prof and the case. First

round's on me back at Virginia Beach.

SHANE

Hold on.

SHANE

You know how to swim?

5.

PLUMMER

Oh my God. I can't believe you... how'd

we... That was the most incredible...

SHANE

Better keep that on `til we get to the

rendezvous point.

PLUMMER

(through the mouth piece)

Why? Poison gas?

SHANE

(re: the oxygen)

No. I'm just not big on chit chat.

CHARLES

Lieutenant, thank you. (He pats his

briefcase) You saved more than just my

life today. Can I call my wife to let

her know I'm okay?

SHANE

Negative. Not imperative to the mission.

We have to keep moving. I have strict

orders to get you out of here safely.

CHARLES

I'm safe, Lieutenant. Please. She thinks

I'm dead. (then) Don't you have a family?

6.

SHANE

(this gets him:)

Make it quick.

CHARLES

Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

My kids. It's voice activated. Designed

it myself. I do security, that's my

specialty. (gestures back:) Those guys

back there tried to get this case open

for five days -- couldn't crack it. And

you should see what happens to you if

open it without the code. I have a

picture of my kids in here, you want to

see it?

SHANE

Negative.

CHARLES

Battery's dead...

CHARLES (CONT'D)

Honey, I'm alive...

SHANE

We're almost ready.    Just gives us a -

SHANE (CONT'D)

Professor, RUN!!!

F

ADE TO BLACK:

SHANE

Captain, sir.

BILL

As you were Lieutenant.

BILL (CONT'D)

We've been through a lot together Shane.

You're the best man I ever trained. And a

good friend.

SHANE

... I know sir. And I except full

responsibility for the mission's failure.

BILL

Why the hell did you let him use the

satellite phone?

SHANE

He had to call his family. A lapse in

judgement on my part that I regret sir.

8.

BILL

... Plummer was the best security expert

the department of defense ever had -- a

genius. He was working on a program that

scrambles launch codes. He called it

G.H.O.S.T.: Guided High-altitude

Scrambling Transmitter. One pulse from

the GHOST satellite and a country can't

launch its own nukes. That's what the

Serbians kidnapped him for, but they

couldn't get S

inside the briefcase.

SHANE

The case was empty sir, as I stated in my

report.

BILL

Not a surprise, really. Not like the

professor to hide things where someone

might look for them. G.H.O.S.T. is still

out there, (Bill smiles:) which is why

I'm going to give you another shot.

SHANE

Sir. Thank you. I... appreciate your

confidence.

SHANE (CONT'D)

I'll need to put a team together. I'm

gonna need the mini sub, I need access to

an EP3 aries 2 spy plane...

BILL

(interrupting:)

Negative. It's not that kind of mission.

BILL (CONT'D)

Two days ago, I got a call from the

professor's wife... Widow. She told me

someone had broken into her home.

Searched the place, top to bottom.

(MORE)

9.

BILL(CONT'D)

She's scared. The family's scared.

Whoever killed the professor must think

G.H.O.S.T. is in that house. Maybe it is,

maybe it isn't. Either way, I need

someone to stay at that house, and

protect them. And while you're there --

find out if the program is in there.

SHANE

That's it? Why would you want me for

that, sir.

BILL

The professor's wife requested you.

CHARLES (O.S.)

Honey, I'm alive. Listen: A lot can

happen between here and home -- if

anything happens to me, call Lt. Shane

Wolfe. He's a good man... anyway, I

should go. I'll call you in an hour. I

love you.

BILL

... You gotta problem with this mission?

SHANE

Sirnosir. It's just that... I've never

been very good with kids, sir. Not even

when I was a kid sir.

LULU

Mom! There's some weird bald guy at the

door!

EMALE VOICE (o.s.)

(before she sees Shane:)

Look, if you're with the Hare Krishnas,

we're not interested...

SHANE

(salutes:)

Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, reporting for

duty.

JULIE

Of course. I'm so sorry.   Thank you for

coming.

JULIE (CONT'D)

Come in and meet the rest of the gang.

11.

JULIE

KIIIDDS!!!

JULIE (CONT'D)

Get your butts down here and say "hello!"

JULIE (CONT'D)

You've already met Lulu. This is Peter,

Zoe and Todd. Kids, this is Lieutenant

Wolfe. He's the man who is going to be

staying with us for a while.

KIDS

Hi.

JULIE

And this is Helga and Tyler.

SHANE

(official:)

Ma'am... Baby.

JULIE

Kids, go finish your homework.   And I'll

be checking.

SHANE

You have a pleasant family, ma'am.

12.

JULIE

Charles wasn't around too much. His work

took him all over the world. He'd be gone

six or seven months at a time. So I

think for the younger ones it's a little

confusing. Zoe and Todd... well, they're

dealing like your normal teenagers.

Maybe in Todd's case semi-normal.

SHANE

Mrs. Plummer, I have to tell you that I

did everything I could...

JULIE

Charles was in a dangerous business. I

knew it when I married him. No one's to

blame here.

(beat)

Everyone thinks that Charles told me or

the kids where he hid it. And until

G.H.O.S.T. is found, we're all in danger.

SHANE

Nothing will happen to your family as

long as I'm here. I've dealt with much...

JULIE

That's Gary. He was Charles'.

SHANE

Mrs. Plummer-

JULIE

Call me Julie.

SHANE

... Mrs. Plummer, I'll go secure the

perimeter.

JULIE

I'm glad you're here-

CUT TO:

Nighttime -- the family eats dinner. We slowly pull

BILL (o.s.)

Julie, it's Bill Fawcett. I have some

potentially good news.

JULIE

What is it?

BILL (o.s.)

A safety deposit box under Charles' name

was just found in Switzerland. I think

it could contain GHOST.

JULIE

That's wonderful. This could all be over!

BILL (o.s.)

There's a catch. Swiss law says only his

family can access it. I'm going to need

you on a plane tomorrow morning.

JULIE

I'll be there.

14.

JULIE

Don't worry about the Kids, Helga will

handle everything. (Worried:) But if

there is an emergency, all the emergency

numbers are on the fridge. And on the

phone. And on the back door...

ZOE

Mom -- we'll be fine, chill.

JULIE

(a little choked up:)

I know, it's just... I am a mom, it's my

job to worry. ... I love you guys. I'm

gonna miss you. I'll be back in 48 hours.

And guys, whatever Lieutenant Wolfe asks

you to do... do it. Okay?

ll the children nod in agreement except Zoe who pops her

JULIE (CONT'D)

Lieutenant, I don't want you to worry

about anything except the safety of my

children. Helga will take care of

everything else.

SHANE

Don't worry. They'll be safe with me.

HELGA

Everything will be fine, Mrs. Plummer.

HELGA (CONT'D)

Tell me, are you licensed to kill?

SHANE

... No.

HELGA

(she frowns)

Too bad.

MALE VOICE (o.s.)

ZOE

He's my boyfriend, tool.

So you're the one who broke in.

Okay, fine... come on Scott.

Not with this kid. (to Todd:) You --

Gimme twenty!

I meant PUSH-UPS!

SHANE

My apologies. We had an intruder. A

simple misunderstanding.

MR. CHUN

(perfect English, no accent)

We speak English, Kojak.

SHANE

Oh. Sorry.

MRS. CHUN

... Look, about the 2000 decibel alarm

and the kleig lights and stuff... we own

a bakery, so we're up kind of early.

Would you mind?

SHANE

Sorry.

MR. CHUN

Thanks a bunch. Oh, and we found this in

our pool filter... Try to keep that zoo

reigned in, huh baby-sitter?

hane marches Zoe up the stairs. Loud, angry rock music

Your mother thought you were in real

danger. You should have told her the

truth.

Who do you think you are -- my dad?

ZOE (CONT'D)

Let me go! It's Saturday night.   I have

plans!

Not anymore.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Lights out.

TODD (o.s.)

Bite me!

ELGA

When you're down and low, lower than the

floor.

And you feel like you ain't got a chance.

Don't make a move `til you're in the

groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance.

Just hop three times like a kangaroo --

HELGA (CONT'D)

Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.

Three steps forward, one step back.

HELGA (CONT'D)

Then quick like a turtle lie on your

back!

riggle like a snake `til you can't no

HELGA

What's it matter? Nobody speaks Romanian.

SHANE

Usca mi-as chilotii pe crucea lu mata!

HELGA

(She curses Again, in Romanian.)

SHANE

Listen up, ladies. Your behavior is

unacceptable. In order to maintain a

state of safety we need to maintain a

state of discipline and order. I've only

got one rule: Everything is done my way.

No highway option. Do you copy?

LULU

Do you copy?

SHANE

What?   I said -- do you...

LULU

("copying" him)

What?   I said -- do you...

Do not copy me!

Tracking devices. Now that I know I can't

trust you... Never take them off. The

panic button is only for emergencies.

Touch that -- you better be dying, or

you're dead.

ZOE

I am not wearing that. Just because my

mom's paranoid doesn't mean we have to

take orders from you.

SHANE

Let me explain how the chain of command

works. I tell you what to do -- and you

do it. End of chain. Now I'm not gonna

have time to learn your names. So you are

It didn't have to go down like-

All I need is a hammer and some plaster

of Paris. I can fix this.

TODD

Can I get by?

Here's your bracelet. If you'd been

wearing it, this wouldn't have happened.

Stop it, Peter!

Hey, hey, good soldiers aren't afraid of

anything.

LULU

This house is haunted. Daddy even said

so. He said there's a ghost.

SHANE

Really?   And where is this ghost?

ULU

I don't know.     I've never seen it.

ZOE

Here he comes...!

TODD

He's coming back-

HELGA

AHHH!!!

inally, BAM! Helga HITS the bottom with a mighty crash.

IGHT - ZOE AND TODD

ZOE

Uh-oh.

BILL

As we discussed, this is an urgent

matter.

25.

JULIE

Can't you call somebody? Do something to

get us around all this paperwork?

BILL

Sorry. Not in Switzerland, I can't.

Bill can't stand it anymore. He jumps to his feet.

BILL (CONT'D)

This is absurd. If we can't get some

faster service, we're going to have to

file a complaint.

BANKER

Marcel!

MARCEL

Oui.

BANKER

Je ne comprende pas.

MARCEL

(to Bill and Julie:)

I'm so sorry, the chief does not speak

English. But I can tell you -- you will

have access to the box tout-suite. As

soon as your background checks clear.

JULIE

Thank you. How long is that?

HELGA

AGGH!     These brats!   Sugi Pula!

SHANE

Red Leader, remain calm --

26.

HELGA

I am calm. I QUIT, that makes me calm!

SHANE

Let's not be hasty.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Hello---

(sees Helga crawling away)

Don't even think about it.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Ah, Mrs. Plummer.

(covering the phone, so Julie

can't hear the struggle)

No no -- everything's fine. You're gonna

be gone how much longer?

here's a pause, the camera DOLLY/ZOOMS as he says it:

SHANE (CONT'D)

Five business days?

elga's shoe comes off -- Helga falls forwards, and Shane

SHANE (CONT'D)

That is not a problem. Just doing my...

SHANE (CONT'D)

Duty.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Ah! Things are GREAT!!! You do what you

have to do.

27.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Take care, Mrs. Plummer.

SHANE

Red Leader! I command you to come back!

That is a direct order! You can't leave

a man behind!!

SHANE (CONT'D)

(SCREAMING)

I don't know the Peter Panda song!!

KOREAN WOMAN

Don't worry, if she loves you, she'll

come back.

SHANE

Okay, listen up. There's been a change of

plans. Your mom's not coming back as

soon as she thought...

28.

LULU

(worried)

When is she coming back?

SHANE

Soon. In the meantime, we're just gonna

have some more big fun.

TODD

That's what we've been doing?

LULU

But tomorrow's a school day.

ZOE

I need a signed release for Driver's Ed!

LULU

I've got Brownies!

SHANE

Whoa, WHOA! HALT! We'll take this hill

one inch at a time. Only then can we

rise to the challenge. All for one, and

one for all!

LULU

"Be all that you can be!"

SHANE

That's Army. I'm Navy.     But I appreciate

your enthusiasm.

nice moment.   Until -- FWRPPPP!

Tell me that was the duck?

Hey.   HEY!

SHANE

The things I do for my country.

LULU

Hi. Zoe thinks you look like the Hulk. I

think you're cute.

SHANE

(unsure how to respond...)

Thank you.

LULU

Do you know Kung Fu?

SHANE

Affirmative.

LULU

Did you ever punch someone so hard that

their head came off?

hane walks away from Lulu. She follows. Shane is again

30.

LULU (CONT'D)

What's that medal for?

SHANE

None of your business.

LULU

I'll trade you a SpongeBob button for it.

LULU (CONT'D)

Is that so people can't hurt us?

SHANE

I think -- it's time for you take a nappy-

poo, in beddibye land, little girl.

LULU

Do I look like I'm five to you?

SHANE

What are you waiting for?    Dig in.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Don't worry, I can get lots more of

those. And I've survived off this stuff

for months.

31.

ZOE

Like I'm really gonna eat all those

carbs.

SHANE

Okay, ladies. Your mama -- is not here to

take care of you now. So -- here's how

it's gonna be. We're gonna pull together,

all for one, one for all. If I say in,

you stay in, if I say out, you go out...

PETER

Ba ba do the hokie pokey...

SHANE

I did not say at ease!

ZOE

He's only two, he doesn't have any idea

what you're talking about. I don't have

any idea what you're talking about...

LULU

Can you kill a man with your bare hands?

SHANE

You play too many video games. (then:)

Yes.

LULU

... I can cross my eyes. Wanna see?

SHANE

Negative.

LULU

Tyler hates it when I do that...

32.

SHANE

Plummer residence... yes, I know it's

Monday. Oh. Thank you, sir.

ZOE

Who was that?

SHANE

Your vice principal. He said if you're

late again, you and Todd are expelled. He

wants to see you in his office. With your

... legal guardian.

LULU

We're gonna be late.

SHANE

Not on my watch.

33.

MURNEY

I always said these kids didn't need a

baby sitter, they needed a parole

officer. Looks like Mrs. Plummer finally

listened.

MURNEY (CONT'D)

(To Shane)

What's your name, son?

SHANE

Wolfe. Shane. Lieutenant. I'm in charge

of watching these kids for... a few days.

MURNEY

aby-sitter huh. Well, whatever work you

can get. I'm Murphy. Duane. V.P in charge

of discipline, conduct and truancy. Top

to bottom, K thru 12. You're in my house

now, boy. I coach wrestling, too. (re:

Todd:) And the creeper here played hookey

from every wrestling practice this month.

MURNEY (CONT'D)

She's missed twenty-two Driver's Ed

classes. Out of twenty-three. They're the

worst students in my school.

OMAN'S VOICE

Your school?

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Good morning kids. What are you doing in

my office, Murney?

MURNEY

I was explaining, that as vice principal,

I am in charge of....

34.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Very little. I thought I asked you to

find out who stuck to the baloney slices

to the cafeteria ceiling with mustard?

MURNEY

I'm got some leads. (then, confidential:)

My informant's about to crack.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Then hop to it. I think I can handle this

from here.

SHANE

Red 1, Red 2. Get moving.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

So. You're the new baby-sitter?

SHANE

Bodyguard. You see, Mrs. Plummer called

my captain, she thought the kids needed -

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

It's okay, Lieutenant, I was briefed of

the situation by Mrs. Plummer. She told

me all about you.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE (CONT'D)

Lieutenant, huh? You with "The Teams?"

(Shane nods.)

Petty Officer Third Class Claire Nelson

at your service.

SHANE

... You're kidding?

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Four years at Naval base Coronado.   The

Service paid for my college.

35.

SHANE

"Honor, Courage...

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Commitment". That's the way I live my

life, and the way I run my school.

SHANE

Can't be too careful. So. Permission to

stick around and keep eyes on the kids?

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Permission granted. Welcome aboard. Just

try not to frighten the children.

SHANE

No one will even notice I'm here.

JUMP CUT TO:

SHANE

Clean as a whistle.

BINOCULARS P.O.V. as Shane goes from window to window of

SHANE (CONT'D)

Back off. Official Business.

36.

SHANE

Give up now. Save us both a world of

pain. Now -- last time: Open the hanger,

Black Hawk coming in.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Open in T minus three, two, one...

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

What would you say is the secret with

kids, Mr. Wolfe?

SHANE

Show no weakness.

RINCIPAL CLAIRE

I'll drink to that. (she toasts, with

milk.) Shane... Can I call you Shane?

SHANE

... Sure.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

So. When you agreed to serve your

country, I bet you didn't know you'd be

serving creamed bananas to one year olds,

huh?

37.

SHANE

Hey -- I out rank you, you know.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Not here, you don't. You're on dry land,

lieutenant. (she looks at his chair)

Well, not so dry where you're sitting, I

guess.

SHANE

Oh, man...

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Don't take this personally -- but you're

pretty good at this. Seriously, I'm

impressed. A whole day, and all three

Plummer's stayed out of trouble.

That's... unusual.

ZOE

Kick his butt, Todd!

RINCIPAL CLAIRE

Who started this?

MURNEY

He did. (Todd)

38.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Todd started a fight with five students

at once?

MURNEY

The kid's mixed up. Look at him.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

If I catch anyone on the team fighting

again, next week's tournament is off. I

don't care who starts it.

MURNEY

You heard the lady. Any more fighting and

there'll be no more wrestling. Personally

I think that's a little harsh. Boys'll be

boys. (low, to Todd:) `Scept for Plummer

here.

SHANE

... Nice moves, man.

MURNEY

Pretty slick, Frogman -- I'm a black belt

myself. S'why they asked me to coach the

wrestling team.

MURNEY (CONT'D)

See -- total control. Maybe you could

stop by practice, we'd show the boys how

a couple of pros do it, what do you say?

Come on, promise I'll go easy on you.

SHANE

... Sorry, sir. I'm on duty.

39.

MURNEY

Oh, yeah. That's right. I forgot you had

to baby-sit. Maybe some other time then.

MURNEY (CONT'D)

Looks like pretty boy there's all bark

and no bite.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

... Don't even think it, Murney. He'd

kill you so fast, I wouldn't even have

time to get my camera.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Another day, another dollar twenty, minus

taxes... aren't you gonna change him?

SHANE

I'd love to, for one who'll eat, and not

cry.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

That's not what I mean, Lt.

SHANE

Oh -- change him. Roger that. Uh...

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Sirnosir. Not my job.

SHANE

But...

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Instructions are right on the box.

Bathroom's down the hall. Have fun.

40.

SHANE

Emergency!

LULU

See! My nanny can kick your nanny's butt.

SHANE

Thanks.

CONSTRUCTION WORKER

What hell do you think you're doing?

SHANE

Tell me where the kids are and I'll let

you all live!

CONSTRUCTION WORKER

Buddy, you're about to get a beat down.

that a.p.b..

CUTE COP (CONT'D)

In the future, use our nonemergency

number. That's the one to call if

nobody's fleein' or bleedin'.

CLAIRE

Shane are you okay?

SHANE

(eerily calm:)

Just fine, thank you.

CLAIRE

I should probably get going then. If you

need anymore help... Call.

43.

BROWNIE

oo hoo! Hubba hubba!

SHANE

Who are those people?

LULU

It's my troop, it's Monday. Monday,

Wednesday and Saturday are troop nights.

SHANE (O.S.)

Get rid of them.

LULU

I can't. Everybody's parents go out on

troop nights. They won't be home `til

ten. Mom's our den mother.

LULU (CONT'D)

Tonight we're supposed to sell cookies.

SHANE

Selling cookies isn't imperative to my

mission.

LULU

We have to. If we don't sell enough

cookies, we can't go the Jamboree, and if

we can't go to the Jamboree.

(whispers:)

Come on, Shane. You gotta help me out.

They already think I'm a loser. And it's

not like I have any other friends, cause

mom never lets me out of her sight...

44.

SHANE

Alright, ladies. Here's how it's gonna

be. Tonight, I'm gonna be your den --

commander. That means if you want to live

to see tomorrow, do as I say. DO WE

UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?

BROWNIE

Den Mother? ... I'm scared of you.

SHANE

Good. Now -- wait here.

ZOE

... yeah, he's a total psycho. I think

mom found him from one of those Tough

Love boot camps or something...

ZOE

This is totally cruel and unusual! You

can't do this -- we could run out of air!

45.

ZOE

.. he's got us on lock-down, it's like

Oz or something. No, not munchkin Oz --

HBO Oz. (she listens:) Hm... I dunno if

that's a good idea, Scott...

SHANE

I gotta get supplies. I can see you

through the window, but if anything

happens...

LULU

(flashing her bracelet)

I know.

BROWNIE

Oh no... they're back.

UGLY CUB SCOUT

(to another Scout)

Hey Skeever, what's stinky and floats

`til you flush `em?

2ND SCOUT

Brownies?

UGLY CUB SCOUT

This is Troop 16 territory. How are we

supposed to sell raffle tickets when this

place reeks of your skanky cookies?

2ND SCOUT

BEAT IT, before I get my face punching

badge on you.

SHANE

Where are my troops?

UGLY CUB SCOUT

... I haven't seen anybody, you Skeever?

2ND SCOUT

Nope. You wanna buy a raffle ticket?

We're trying to win .22's.

47.

SHANE

What happened? (No one answers) Well?

LULU

Those boys over there broke our cookies.

SHANE

Well then -- I'm afraid I have to

eliminate them. If I don't come back --

avenge my death.

BROWNIES

No!

SHANE

This is not a toy. I'm here to protect

you. Not cookies. Get in the car, we're

going home.

BROWNIE

You can't take us home yet, you're

supposed to take us to dinner.

SHANE

Where?

MANAGER

Welcome to Chuck E. Cheese!

SHANE

I wish I were in Chechnya.

48.

MANAGER

Anything elsh I can do for you?

SHANE

In a big glass (he shows him)   This much

ice... this much cyanide.

MANAGER

How `bout a re-fill on that pischer of

Mischer Pibb?

SHANE

What?

MANAGER

(gesturing:)

Pischer of Mischer Pibb?   Mischer Pibb?

LULU

Let's fight!

SHANE

I'm watching your brother...

LULU

I pressed two player. I thought you liked

combat. Unless you're scared.

VIDEO GAME/LULU

Prepare to be annihilated!

SHANE

That's not fair. Nobody can jump thirty

feet.

LULU

The Hulk can.

SHANE

That wasn't a documentary.

SHANE (CONT'D)

This isn't fair. My joystick's broken.

LULU

You wanna switch?

SHANE

I AM TOO TRYING.

Too slow... come on -- take a shot...

oops too slow... swing and a miss...

Seriously, everything's cool. The guy's

just a control freak.

JULIE

It's only a few more days. I hate leaving

you, but you know I have to do this. I

love you.

ZOE

I know. Don't worry, we're okay. Tonight

I'm just doing homework -- in my cell.

ZOE

Dude, this is outta hand. Who are all

these people?

SCOTT

Jus' ma peeps. And the folks who read my

BLOG.

51.

ZOE

Dude, not cool...

SHANE

Move, move, move! Go go!

MANAGER

I figured you'd come back for him -- they

almost always do.

SHANE

Inexcusable, to leave a man behind like

that...

MANAGER

Relax, we once found a kid in the ball

pool when we opened in the morning --

MANAGER (CONT'D)

WHOA, Whoa. Not okay, freestyling in the

ball pool -- not okay.

52.

LULU

Should we send someone in after him?

SHANE

Clear out! GO GO GO!

hane gives a blood-curdling stare.

SHANE

Party's over.

SHANE

No one leaves until this house is

spotless! I want to be able to eat off

the floor! The latrine! Hell, I wanna

be able to eat in the kitchen!!

Oh no you don't. Now, we're gonna do this

my way -- no highway option.

show no respect for you or your house.

Because you have no respect for yourself.

ZOE

I do too respect myself.

ueasy, she pukes again. Shane hands her a handkerchief.

SHANE

You got barf on your tank top.

(Announces:) Company, downstairs!

ZOE

You're not my dad!

ZOE (CONT'D)

We hate you, you hate us. You're like a

robot. Why don't you just leave us alone?

55.

SHANE

You're right, Red 1. I'm not the man for

this job.

LULU

Shane --!

SHANE

In all my years I have never been treated

with such disrespect. Not even from the

enemy. Don't worry, as soon as your mom

comes back, I'm gone.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Now what?

ZOE

(sighs, tired) It's Scott...

SHANE

Puberty... talking doesn't do any good.

Go to your rooms.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Go!

NINJA

GHOST -- hand it over!

LULU

Please don't leave us Shane.

SHANE

I'm not going anywhere.

ZOE

I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.

SHANE

Shhh... It's okay.

TODD

Who were they? What did they want...?

SHANE

They're looking for a program, that your

father invented.

ZOE

So Mom's not paranoid? There really are

people out to get us.

SHANE

They're not after you. They want this.

But nothing's gonna happen to you, as

long as I'm here. And I'm not going

anywhere.

58.

SHANE (CONT'D)

But I can't do this without your help,

okay? We need a little more cooperation

here. (the Kids nod) Tell you what --

let's start over. From now on, you listen

to me, and do what I say. (to Zoe and

Todd:) And I... I'll listen to you too.

Deal? Truce -- okay?

SHANE

C'mon c'mon c'mon...

ZOE

Hey mom we're fine, absolutely nothing

happened you should worry about. Nope.

SHANE

Mrs. Plummer... two men tried to get into

the house tonight.

WE INTERCUT:

JULIE

Oh my god!

59.

SHANE

No - it's okay. They're gone, everyone's

fine. They were looking for GHOST, but

they didn't find it. You have any luck?

JULIE

Well, yes and no. We found something in

the box... But we're not sure what it is.

Bill thinks it's part of the GHOST. It

looks like some kind of "key". We just

don't know what its for.

JULIE (CONT'D)

The good news is I'll be home in two

days, as soon as the customs paperwork

clears.

SHANE

(very genuine)

...So soon? We were just starting to have

fun. Don't worry -- we'll be just fine.

SHANE

I gotta warn you guys: From now on, I'm

gonna be sticking even closer.

VOICE (OVER THE PA:)

Will Shane Wolfe please report to Vice

Principal Murney in the gym.

SECOND GRADERS

Ooooooooh! (You're in trouble!)

SHANE

Don't worry. So, she wrecked a driver's

Ed. car -- she'll pay for the damage...

MURNEY

That? Lady drivers, what do you expect.

No, it's not that -- it's the boy...

SHANE

Red two? I mean Todd?

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Ordinarily I would wait for his mother to

return... but -- I'm a bit concerned, and

I'm not sure what to do...

SHANE

Has he been skipping class?

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Well -- yes. He does always miss sixth

period. But this...

61.

MURNEY

This is how he showed up to practice. And

that's not all. I was doing a little re-

con in his locker... and I found this:

MURNEY (CONT'D)

If he'd had Hustler or something, boys

will be boys -- but this is just sick.

SHANE

He's not a NAZI.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

It's certainly not normal.

(pulls Shane aside.)

See if you can talk to the boy.   Find out

what's going on.

MURNEY

hope you won't go light on him -- that

whole family's no good, if you ask me.

SHANE

I'll talk to him.

MURNEY

You're a good man, Shane. Bet you're a

hell of a fighter on the mats, huh?

(Shane ignores him, and keeps

walking.)

Maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll

give these boys a treat.

SHANE

Another time, maybe...

MURNEY

It's a date then. I'll show you a couple

moves. I promise I won't hurt you.

62.

MURNEY (CONT'D)

See that? You never know when your

adversary is going to strike!

SHANE

Did you kick me in the back? Is there a

footprint on my jacket?

MURNEY

Come on Frogman! Don't be a sissy!

SHANE

Wait Todd, I want to talk to you...

odd yanks his arm away and runs into the house.

SHANE

Smart kid.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Zoe, you're in charge. If anyone gets

within forty clicks of the perimeter,

signal me. Keep all doors sealed, do your

homework, preheat the oven, and make sure

Lulu brushes her teeth!

Alright. All my Nazis are finally here.

Okay, I want all of you at attention.

Okeydokey. Starting from where we left

To write on...

TODD

You are sixteen, going on seventeen...

DIRECTOR

Baby Jesus, have I done some unspeakable

evil that I deserve to be saddled with

the world's worst production of Sound of

Music? (he shouts, at the cast:) We open

in a week. The set's not finished... The

cast is a bunch of clumsy goats -- every

kick ball change would make Bob Fosse dig

himself out of the earth, so he could

have a heart attack again.

TODD

I'm sorry... I'll get it right.

DIRECTOR

None of you will ever get it right! Which

is why, I quit.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

And with that, he exits stage right...

end scene.

LIESL

You gonna fix him?

SHANE

No. My hands are freezing.

TODD

I'm not going to quit. I hate wresting...

SHANE

AT EASE. (Todd shuts up) Would you

listen, just once? Look, I don't know a

hell of a lot about this kinda stuff,

but... You're good. A lot to learn, but

with hard work, discipline -- you could

make a go of this.

TODD

... but what about Murney?

SHANE

That guy's an idiot.

SHANE (CONT'D)

"Sound of Music" is a great show. My dad

took me to see it when I was a kid.

TODD

You don't seem like the musical type.

SHANE

Come on. Julie Andrews was hot.

TODD

What if... girls'll think I'm... weird or

something?

66.

SHANE

You know what girls think is weird?

Wrestling. Men in leotards pinning each

other to the floor? I've never understood

that. Chicks dig guys who can dance.

TODD

Doesn't matter now anyway... show's

off... it's over.

SHANE

COMPANY -- CENTER STAGE!

SHANE (CONT'D)

DO YOU, OR DO YOU NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

TO PERFORM THIS MUSICAL?

LIESL

We don't have a director...

SHANE

No director? I have directed rescue

missions in Afghanistan! I've directed

numerous snatch and grabs in countries

who's names you are not allowed to know.

I have choreographed multi-pronged

amphibious landings and stealth air

attacks!

(full of bravado)

Do you think I have the stomach to whip

this production into shape, or not?

TODD

Yes.

SHANE

YES WHAT?

67.

TODD/CAST

YESSIR.

SHANE

... What's up?

ZOE

(embarrassed)

Nothing... It's stupid... Scott. I called

him in his room, another girl picked up

the phone. I know it's no big deal. I

don't know why I let it get to me.

SHANE

I don't see what you see in this guy.

ZOE

It's just nice to think someone's

thinking about you, you know?

S

SHANE

(He nods)

It won't happen again.

ZOE

... No wait! ...What are you gonna do?

You're not gonna hurt him are you?

Promise you won't touch him.

Okay. I promise. I won't touch him.

One day, the little Elf family -- Uh.

Went into the magic forest. To find a

secret gnome... facility, where gnomes

where turning mushrooms into... Uranium.

The elves had to go in and take it out.

ULU

Why?

SHANE

They were ordered to. By the Elf Unit

commander at Elf station bravo. So --

they waited for cloud cover, and they

came in from the north...

SHANE (CONT'D)

The Elf Team decided on an L Ambush -- so

three elves formed a base leg and laid

down a heavy suppressive fire on the

gnomes while the others maneuvered around

to the right flank and walked through

finishing off anything left alive... I

mean standing...                    D

day. We got `em all. Even, the teeniest

little elf of all -- Rodriquez.

You have to do the Panda Dance... or he

won't stop.

SHANE

Oh, c'mon... I can't remember that thing.

TODD

I'll write it down for you...

SHANE

When you're down and low, lower than the

floor. And you ain't got a chance. Don't

make a move `til you're in the groove,

and do the Panda Dance...

TODD

You have to do the dance. Like dad used

to do. He made it up for him.

S

SHANE

Just hop three times like a kangaroo --

Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.

Take three steps forward and one step

back... (He does.)

Today you drive.

a Bradley Assault Vehicle.

TODD

Especially when Zoe's driving.

happens when there's no man in the house.

TODD

There is a man in my house -- me. (Murney

turns:) Let's get one thing clear. I'm

not quitting cause I hate wresting. I'm

quitting because you're a bad coach. You

suck. The whole team wants to quit. I'm

you? Cause -- we can talk about it, if

you want.

ZOE

I miss him so much...

SHANE

This was my dad's. He was the only family

I ever had. Mom left when I was little,

cause dad was always gone. Two years

in... an indisclosable locale. Another

six in... Another indisclosable locale. I

didn't really have a home, so I went to

military school -- then one day my mom

got the letter. No more dad.

SHANE (CONT'D)

I always wanted to be just like him. I'm

starting to realize, I never really knew

him. I don't know if I'm like him or not.

ZOE

That's horrible, Shane.

SHANE

The hardest part was living without any

details...why? How? Where? I always

wondered if he thought about me.

OE

Me too.   So how did you get through it?

JULIE

I trusted you. Charles trusted you. So

North Korea pays better.

Keep an eye on them. You -- with me.

BILL

You bring your stethoscope?

MRS. CHUN

No.   But I've got some C4.

ILL

Charles never made things easy.

BILL

How does it work?

JULIE

How does what work?

BILL

Don't play dumb. It's getting old. I want

to know how to get through the booby

traps. What's the code?

JULIE

I don't know any code -- Charles didn't

tell me about the room...

BILL

If I knew Charles had hidden it so well,

I wouldn't have killed him so soon. Don't

make me kill you too.

MRS. CHUN

Mr. Bill, my husband has question:

MR. CHUN (OVER THE WALKIE)

please don't hurt anyone.

JULIE

(to Bill) You can't make him do this --

He doesn't have a chance.

SHANE

(thinking)

Haven't got a chance.

SHANE (CONT'D)

(sings softly to himself)

... When you're down and low, lower than

the floor. And you haven't got a chance.

Don't make a move `til you're in the

groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance.

S

SHANE (CONT'D)

Just hop three times like a kangaroo --

SHANE (CONT'D)

Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.

SHANE (CONT'D)

Three steps forward and one step back.

JULIE

QUICK LIKE A TURTLE LIE ON YOUR BACK!

LULU

Look out Zoe! Rollers!

ZOE

Come on. Use the gas, not the brake, 5-0.

97.

CUTE COP

I'd say you could lose your license --

but you haven't got one!

ZOE

People are trying to kill us. They have

my mom, and our bodyguard -- you have to

follow me!

CUTE COP

Just pull over!

ZOE

Fine. Don't follow me!

MURNEY

That Baloney Bandit struck again. I

accept full responsibility. My

intelligence proved to be faulty, but if

I had more resources...

MURNEY (CONT'D)

(not that surprised:)

I told you not to pass her in Driver's

Ed.

98.

SHANE

Wriggle like a snake `til you can't no

more. Then better jump quick, like there

ain't no floor.

SHANE (CONT'D)

(to himself, to calm down)

Almost done, almost done... "Just hold

your breath, and jump to the left."

SHANE (CONT'D)

And that's the Peter Panda Dance.

BILL

Thank you, Shane. You were always my best

man. I knew you'd figure it out.

BILL (CONT'D)

You know, if you're willing to join up,

I'd be happy to cut you in on the

proceeds. What do you say -- we make a

good team?

SHANE

I was devoted to you, sir. And you

betrayed all of that. All that we stand

for.

99.

BILL

I'll take that as a "no."

BILL (CONT'D)

... I think you better open it.

BILL (CONT'D)

Wait. That's just what you want isn't it?

BILL (CONT'D)

You open it.

BILL (CONT'D)

Oh come on. I walked the floor first.

SHANE

There will be no mercy.

BILL

None requested.

MRS. CHUN

AAAAAA!

100.

SHANE

You're a... terrible neighbor.

JULIE

Shane!   Watch out!

BILL

Any last words?

SHANE

... Say, good night, Peter Panda!

101.

TODD

Zoe! You're going too fast!! You're not

gonna have enough time to stop-

ZOE

Hey, I'M the one in Driver's Ed!    I think

I know what I'm doing!!

SHANE

... GHOST.

JULIE

Thank you Shane. It's finally over. Now

we can go back to our peaceful...

ULLHORN (V.O.)

FREEZE! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

SHANE

Whoa, WHOA!    What are you doing to these

kids??

CUTE COP

FREEZE. HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

102.

ZOE

But, officer...

CUTE COP

I said FREEZE. Zoe, you're in a lot of

trouble... Reckless endangerment!

Driving without a license. Numerous,

uh... trafficS violations --

SHANE

(cutting him off)

These kids are heroes. They just aided

in exposing a high-level espionage ring.

I suggest you call the FBI. Now.

CUTE COP

You expect me to believe any of that?

MR. CHUN (O.S.)

EVERYBODY!   HIT THE GROUND!!!

MR. CHUN (CONT'D)

I WANT THE GHOST, TEN MILLION DOLLARS,

AND A DIRECT FLIGHT TO PYONGYANG!

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Ya!!

103.

COP

I think I'll call the FBI.

DISSOLVE TO:

F

.B.I. AGENT

Mr. Wolfe... that was nice work.   You're

a one-man battalion.

SHANE

Just doing my job.

F.B.I. AGENT

The Bureau is always looking for good

men. Do you have a card or something?

LULU

Do you have to wear that thing in your

ear all the time?

FBI AGENT

Yes.

LULU

Does it itch?

FBI AGENT

Yes...

104.

ZOE

If you're reading this, then Julie found

the key. Julie, Tyler, Peter, Zoe, Todd,

Lulu -- I want to say: I love you more

than anything. I always have.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

So. What happens now? You'll be stationed

somewhere else, right? I guess there's no

more reason for you to stick around here.

SHANE

Well. I'm kinda, re-conning the

situation, here... And to tell the truth.

I don't see anything but reasons to stay.

P

RINCIPAL CLAIRE

So... What's the next move?

SHANE

... I don't know. I'm on dry land. You're

the superior office. You tell me.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE

Well. Summer's almost here. What if you

and me did a little amphibious recon

mission. On, say -- Maui?

SHANE

Sir yes sir.

LULU

This is it. Your work here is through.

Guess you have to go now...

105.

SHANE

Ah, come here you.

ZOE

But...

SHANE

He would've wanted me to give it to

someone I care about. Like he did. Thank

you. For everything.

P

ETER

Love you, Shane.

SHANE

Your dad would be so proud.

LULU

Shane, we're never gonna see you again!

SHANE

What are you talking about?      I'm gonna

see you Friday night.

JULIE

What's Friday night?

SHANE

Tonight is the night we trained for, and

failure is not an option! No detail is

too small! We are the BEST! Remember

your lines, hit your marks, and stay in

character! I expect perfection!
