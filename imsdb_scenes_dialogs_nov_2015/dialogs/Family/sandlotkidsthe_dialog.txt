THE SANDLOT KIDS

Written by

David Mickey Evans & Robert Gunter

June 10 th, 1992

NARRATOR

Everyone's got that one summer when

they were a kid... a summer so perfect,

that it stays with them forever. It

stays caught in time, like Camelot.

pause That summer is like a book with

a million blank pages that you get to

fill with the greatest story you could

ever dream up.

(BEAT)

This is a story about a legend. And

for us, that summer was the one when

the legend got made.

WILDLY:

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

Everybody sometime in their life has

met a real live hero.

(MORE)

2

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

They're not exactly a dime a dozen,

but there's plenty of people who've

done real great things. But hardly

anyone has ever met a certified Legend,

because most of them are dead before

they get voted one.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

So, to actually be there at the moment

one gets made... well, forget about

it. It never happens. Almost never...

To understand how it all got started,

you have to go back...

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

...to the all-time, hands down, complete

and undisputed Legend that ever lived.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

In any language, in any country, in

any world. The Sultan of Swat. The

King of Clout. The Great Bambino.

You have to go back to...

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

...The Babe.

(BEAT)

There's never been anyone greater than

The Babe. And when he called his famous

full count homerun in the 1932 world

series, he made sure he'd live forever.

THE BABE

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

And it's a good thing he became

immortal, because without him, what

happened that summer, absolutely never

(MORE)

3

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

would've happened. Weird thing was,

before I moved to the neighborhood, I

had no idea who he was. And he played

a game I knew nothing about.

NARRATOR

Fourteen years later, after The Babe

was gone, there was another guy who

had something to do with the legend

getting made too. A guy who set a

record that summer that was so awesome,

some people still don't believe it.

Game over. Sixteen zip. Murderers'

YEAH-YEAH

Milk-milk-pee.

HAM

Great, I'm dyin' a thirst and you pee

me out!

BENNY

Ham, it ain't really.

HAM

Then switch with me.

BENNY

Do I look stupid?

NARRATOR

I moved to the neighborhood about a

month before school let out. I was

from another state, and didn't have a

single friend in a thousand miles.

SCOTTY'S

HE SPIES

NARRATOR

It was a lousy way to end up the 5th

grade, 'cause I had zip time to make

friends before summer. And that's

about where it all started...

THE GANG

HAM

Fifth grade's history, man. A hundred

days, man. A Hundred days of baseball.

All Day, everyday, as much as we can.

That's the best.

TIMMY

We got all summer.

REPEAT

We got all summer.

BENNY

Let's play.

YEAH-YEAH

Yeah-Yeah... let's play.

NARRATOR

Everyone but the Timmons twins lived

on my new block.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

They lived in a house by the sandlot

and had the world's greatest tree house,

because their dad was a contractor.

8

THE BLOCK

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

Even before I knew any of them I envied

that tree house...

NARRATOR

...later, it would become second only

to Cape Canaveral as a command post

for history.

(BEAT)

When I moved in that summer, I'd never

played baseball, but it wasn't too

tough figuring out who these guys'

heroes were. So, after a week of

watching... I figured baseball seemed

like the best way to get in with them.

THE MARBLE

BEDROOM

SCOTTY

Sorry, Mom.

MOM

I thought we agreed we'd take this

apart... and not spend so much time in

here.

SCOTTY

(FEELING LOW)

I know - but it's just nighttime.

MOM

Scotty, have you made any friends yet?

SCOTTY

No.

MOM

Why not, honey?

SCOTTY

'Cause I'm still "new."

MOM

Honey, I don't want you sitting in

here all summer fiddling with this

stuff, like you did last summer... and

the one before that.

(BEAT)

Scotty, look at me. I know you're

smart, and I'm proud of you. But you

have to get outside, you have to...

play.

10

MOM (CONT'D)

I want you to get out in the fresh air

and make friends. Run around and scrape

your knees. Get dirty. Climb trees

and hop fences. Get in trouble for

crying out loud.

(BEAT)

Not too much, but some. You have my

permission. Now how many mothers do

you think say that to their sons?

SCOTTY

None mothers I guess.

MOM

I want you to make friends this summer,

Scotty. Lots of them.

SCOTTY

I know, but I don't - I'm no good at

anything. Face it, Mom, I'm just an

EGGHEAD -

MOM

- and you'll always be just an egghead

with an attitude like that. So promise

me, alright?

SCOTTY

'Kay.

MOM

Maybe tomorrow you'll make some friends.

SCOTTY

Yeah, maybe tomorrow.

(BEAT)

Mom? Do you think Bill - I mean Dad -

will teach me to play catch?

MOM

Are you kidding, he'd love it, you

know what an athlete he wasIn high

school.

(ALTERMNATE LINE)

You know what a pitcher he was in high

college.

11

BILL (O.S.)

Yeah...

NARRATOR

My real dad died when I was just a

little kid. My mom married Bill a

year before we moved to the

neighborhood.

(BEAT)

At the time, he and I were still getting

used to each other.

SCOTTY

Um, Dad - sorry, I mean Bill, remember

you promised you'd teach me to play

catch?

BILL

Um hum...

SCOTTY

Well, could you teach me?

BILL

Sure.

SCOTTY

Okay. Great. Thanks.

BILL

Um hum.

IN

THE GANG'S

NARRATOR

They never kept score. They never

chose sides. They never even really

stopped playing the game... it just

went on forever. Everyday they picked

up right where they left off the day

before. It was an endless "dream game."

(BEAT)

There was only 8 of them, so they didn't

have a whole team. It didn't matter

though... Benny was so good he took

everyone's position when it was there

ups.

(BEAT)

I didn't know any of that then... I

just knew they were having the time of

their lives and I wanted to be a part

of it.

SCOTTY

SCOTTY

(TO HIMSELF)

My life is over.

BENNY

DENUNEZ

Come on, Benny-man, didn't you see

that throw?

HAM

(TRULY STUNNED)

That kid's got the gaw'damn panty-

waistiest arm I ever saw in my whole

life.

SQUINTS

I seen a guy once that threw like that.

I mean not that bad, but at least so

bad that he hadda move in the fourth

grade 'cause they nicknamed him

"Bloomers."

BENNY

I bet not one of you knows how The

Babe got his nickname.

HAM

Easy, 'cause of the way he looked like

a little kid face.

BERTRAM

Bull, it's just 'cause he liked kids

and stuff.

SQUINTS

Wrong. The Babe was called The Babe,

because he was like the child of Yankee

Stadium.

17

BENNY

I knew it. You're all full of crap.

George Herman Ruth got his nickname

because his mom died when he was just

a little kid, and he hadda go live in

an orphanage.

BENNY (CONT'D)

Nobody liked him there. The bigger

guys picked on him all the time. And

when they messed with him he couldn't

fight back, 'cause he was just... like

scared. So when they messed with him,

he cried about it.

(BEAT)

He cried... so they called him The

Babe.

BENNY (CONT'D)

How ya think that kid just felt?

NARRATOR

Everyone knew Benny was different.

Nobody ever voted or anything, but he

was the leader.

THE MOON

NARRATOR

Even though he seemed like a regular

guy, he wasn't. Benny was special,

and he was loyal.

(BEAT)

When they'd all tried out for youth

league, they'd all made it. But when

they found out they'd have to play on

different teams, Benny told 'em that

if they couldn't play together, they

shouldn't play at all. So, they stayed

together.

18

NARRATOR

So, the only person that ever felt

sorry for me 'cause I was such a weenie

was Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.

(BEAT)

Even though neither of us knew it at

the time, we were connected. Like I

had been born for just that one moment,

when I would perform the world's all-

time boner, and Benny would bail me

out.

(BEAT)

Connected as friends... born to meet

for just that one moment.

BILL & SCOTTY

SCOTTY

Sorry...

MOM

(QUIETLY)

Well?...

SCOTTY

He's too busy, Mom.

MOM

(ENCOURAGING)

Go back in there and ask. He'll take

the time. Go on.

19

SCOTTY

Um, Da -

SCOTTY (CONT'D)

(so Mom won't hear)

- I mean, Bill. Could we... I mean

could you, like you said - teach me to

catch today?

BILL

Um, yeah, but later, okay? I gotta

get this done.

SCOTTY

Okay, thanks.

MOM

Bill, can't you take a break and teach

him now?

SCOTTY

Mom, it's okay -

(NOBODY'S LISTENING)

BILL

Honey, I said I would and I will. I'm

just under the gun here, ya know?

SCOTTY

Mom, really -

MOM

- How long could it take? You can't

spare a half hour to show him?

BILL

(ANNOYED)

Fine. Alright. I'll get my glove.

SCOTTY (CONT'D)

BILL

BENNY

With nine Guys we got a whole team.

27

HAM

No, with Elswenger we had a whole team,

TIMMY

Benny, you already play all the empty

positions since Elswenger moved to

Arizona.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

It was just a shoe box, but whoever we

HAM (CONT'D)

-then when the mallow's flamin', ya

(BEAT)

Then, you scarf.

HAM (CONT'D)

(BARELY INTELLIGIBLE)

Kinda messy... Good though.

SQUINTS

Alright, listen up.

(TO SCOTTY)

First time DeNunez heard this story he

FAINTED -

DENUNEZ

- Bull, Squints!

BENNY

You did, man.

37

SQUINTS

When Yeah-Yeah heard it he peed his

pants.

YEAH-YEAH

Shut up, Squints - did not!

HAM

You did, man.

SQUINTS

And when The Ham heard it he barfed up

two bags of marshmallows.

HAM

Liar! It was only one.

SQUINTS

So stay away from the door... you

might fall out. And don't sit on your

sleeping bag... you could shit your

pants.

(SOLEMN)

Now, quiet...

SQUINTS (CONT'D)

The legend of The Beast goes back a

long time... before any of us could

pick up a baseball. Back to a place

called Mertle's Acres.

DREAMY DISSOLVE TO:

SQUINTS (V.O.)

The Beast belongs to Mr. Mertle, the

guy that used to own Mertle's Acres

Junkyard. And nobody's ever seen him

since the day it happened...

38

BURNED-OUT SHELLS

OLD APPLIANCES

SQUINTS (V.O.)

Mertle's Acres was a bitchin' place,

that had everything you could ever

imagine.

OTHER STUFF

SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And the stuff was worth a fortune.

So, one day Mr. Mertle got him this

new pup from the pound. They were

glad to get rid of him, on account of

while he'd been there, he'd killed

three dogs bigger than he was.

(BEAT)

That was exactly what Mr. Mertle figured

he needed to protect his junkyard,

'cause people kept stealing stuff at

night, when he wasn't around.

SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

So he bought The Beast, and set him

loose in Mertle's Acres.

SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The Beast was still just a pup of six

months, but he already weighed a 150

pounds... and he kept gettin' bigger.

39

SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He threw The Beast a trash bag full of

meat every night, and just left him

alone. All alone in the whole place

by himself... to grow.

AN EYEBALL

SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And so, in a few months, the pup grew

into The Beast. And he grew big as a

car. And he grew mean, 'cause nobody

liked him, and he didn't like nobody

either.

(BEAT)

And so he only had one thing on his

mind... to kill.

SQUINTS (V.O.)

And he did. And he liked it.

ANOTHER THIEF

40

SQUINTS (V.O.)

The Beast was the most perfect junkyard

dog that ever lived... a true killing

machine.

(BEAT)

After awhile, the police started getting

phone calls from people, reporting all

the missing thieves. The ones The

Beast had killed... it added up to

about 37 guys.

SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But they never found a single body...

not one. Some people say they all got

away, and were just so scared that

they ended up in insane asylums and

stuff.

(BEAT)

But we know what really happened.

SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The Beast... ate them.

(BEAT)

He ate them bones and all.

41

SQUINTS (V.O.)

The Beast was good at his guarddog

job. Too good. So the cops said he

had to be retired. But he didn't have

to be killed or nothin', on account of

there was no evidence... no bones...

no teeth for dental records.

SQUINTS (V.O.)

The police told Mr. Mertle that if

wanted to keep The Beast, he hadda

lock him in his backyard, so he could

never get out.

A CRANE

SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And that he hadda chain him up, so's

in case he tried to get out to eat

children and stuff, he couldn't.

CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

A WELDER

THE BEAST

42

SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Mr. Mertle asked the cops how long he

had to keep his pup chained up like a

slave.

SQUINTS (V.O.)

They said... until forever.

DREAMY DISSOLVE TO:

REPEAT & TIMMY

DENUNEZ & YEAH-YEAH

BERTRAM'S

BENNY

SCOTTY'S

SQUINTS

SQUINTS

And so... The Beast sits there under

that lean-to, dreaming about the time

when he can break the chain and get

out... dreaming of the time when he

can chase and kill again.

43

THE GANG

BERTRAM

See, man. That's why you can't go

over there. Nobody ever has. Nobody

ever will.

HAM

One kid did, but nobody ever seen him

again.

DENUNEZ

That ain't true -

HAM

- yeah it is! He got eaten!

YEAH-YEAH

Yeah-yeah - that kid who went to get

his kite... what was his name?

DENUNEZ

"Boogers" Fleming?

TIMMY

No. It was that guy with the warts on

his face.

REPEAT

Davy "The Toad."

TIMMY

That's what I said.

SQUINTS

Davy "The Toad" Stodenrous.

BERTRAM

Yeah, The Toad...

YEAH-YEAH

Yeah-yeah, poor Toad.

SCOTTY

(WEAK)

Nuh-uh... none of that's true. You

guys are just -

SQUINTS

- oh, yeah?... Come here. Stick your

head out the window and look down.

44

SCOTTY

SCOTTY

(HUSHED)

He's down there!

SQUINTS

You bet he is.

HAM

Whatever goes over that fence... stays

there.

SQUINTS

It becomes the property of The Beast...

Forever.

NARRATOR

I learned that more than a 150 baseballs

had gone over that fence... and not

one of them was ever seen again. Even

when some brave kid worked up enough

courage to peek over the fence.

(MORE)

45

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

(BEAT)

Because, when they went over, they

vanished.

(BEAT)

I knew it was true, because when I

looked down in there, I didn't see a

single... solitary... one.

POOL HONEYS

NARRATOR

Benny would've played ball all day and

all night... rain shine, tidal wave,

whatever, it didn't matter. Baseball

was the only thing he cared about and

everything else was just a waste of

time.

(BEAT)

But, of all the things we ever did

besides baseball, goin' to the pool

was what he tolerated best. Even though

none of us had ever seen a Playboy

magazine - which we constantly lied

about - we figured the pool was the

next best thing to being there.

THE GANG

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

It wasn't the Pool Honeys like we said,

NARRATOR

Michael "Squints" Palledorous walked a

little taller that day. And we had to

tip our hats to him. He was lucky she

hadn't beat the crap out of him. We

wouldn't have blamed her. What he'd

done was sneaky, rotten and low.

(BEAT)

And cool.

(BEAT)

Not another one among us would've ever,

even for a million dollars, had the

guts to put the move on the Lifeguard.

He did. He had kissed a woman. And

he kissed her long and good.

(BEAT)

We got banned from the pool forever

that day... but every time we walked

by after that, the Lifeguard looked

down from her watchtower, right over

at Squints... and smiled.

I think I know how to get it.

(they're all ears)

Anybody got an Erector Set?

SQUINTS

That thing with the nuts and bolts and

tiny wrenches that you can build junk

out of?

SCOTTY

Exactly.

SQUINTS

Never heard of it.

HAM

I used to have one when I was like I

dunno, a little kid.

GANG

(LIARS)

Might have some pieces. Gee, I don't

think so. I'd have to look. Maybe in

the attic. Not in our room though.

GANG (CONT'D)

Guess I had more than I thought. Forgot

my grandma got me some for my birthday.

It's my little brother's.

BERTRAM

Bitchin'.

SCOTTY

I really like Erector Set.

GANG

(ATTITUDINAL 360'S)

Me too. I was just thinkin' the same

thing. Couldn't agree more, Smalls.

I play with mine all the time.

91

SCOTTY

Let's get to work. Here's the plans -

NARRATOR

My life was over. Just as Bill had

finally warmed up to me, and asked me

to be the man of the house, I had to

knock a priceless chunk of history

into the clutches of a monster. Great.

93

BENNY

We can't get it back, Babe.

(BEAT)

I'm sorry.

BENNY (CONT'D)

M - M - Mom?...

BENNY (CONT'D)

Who's there?!

THE BABE

Now don't go peeing your pants or

nuthin', I'm just here to give ya a

hand.

BENNY

B - B - But, you're...

THE BABE

...dead? Legends never die, kid.

BENNY

You're really him. You're The Babe.

The Sultan of Swat. The King -

94

THE BABE

- of Krash and a hundred other dopey

names. Forget about that, we ain't

got much time. I'm here 'cause you're

in some kinda pickle, right?

BENNY

Yeah.

THE BABE

A baseball with my John Hancock on it

went over a fence, and you can't get

it back. Right?

BENNY

Yeah, right.

THE BABE

(clear and simple)

Then just hop over there and get it.

There ya go. Problem solved.

(tips his cap)

See ya, kid.

BENNY

Wait! I can't.

THE BABE

Can't what?

BENNY

Go into that backyard.

THE BABE

Why not?

BENNY

There's a Beast back there.

THE BABE

What kind?

BENNY

A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one

kid already.

THE BABE

Is that a fact? Listen to me, kid.

(MORE)

95

THE BABE (CONT'D)

Everybody gets one chance to do

something great. Most people either

never take the chance 'cause they're

too scared, or they don't recognize it

when it spits on their shoes.

(BEAT)

This is your "big chance," and ya

shouldn't let it go by.

(PAUSE)

Remember those cards you got the other

day?

BENNY

Sure, yeah, five Maury Wills all in

the same pack.

THE BABE

What're the odds on that?

BENNY

About a zillion to one.

THE BABE

More even. Someone's tellin' you

somethin', kid. And if I was you...

I'd listen.

BENNY

Yeah, but what?

THE BABE

You're the one with the rubba legs.

Figure it out.

(BEAT)

You gotta do what your heart tells

you, else you'll spend the rest of

your life wishin' you had.

BENNY

You mean, I should hop that fence -

and pickle with THE BEAST?!

THE BABE

Lemme tell you something... you

remember that called shot homer I hit?

BENNY

Sure, the greatest most famous and

legendary home run of all time.

THE BABE

Yeah, right, well said.

(MORE)

96

THE BABE (CONT'D)

(BEAT)

Well, you think I knew I was gonna

swat that?

BENNY

Sure ya did, Babe.

THE BABE

Not a chance. Matter of fact, all the

way down to first I kept sayin' to

myself, "you lucky bum."

(BEAT)

Think about that, kid. I'll see ya

later.

THE BABE'S VOICE

Remember, kid. There's heroes and

there's Legends. Heroes get

remembered... but Legends never die.

(BEAT)

Follow your heart, kid, and you'll

never go wrong.

BENNY

(WITH PURPOSE)

I had a dream. Get dressed. We're

goin' to the sandlot.

SCOTTY

Benny - wait. It's okay, it was my

fault. I'll just take whatever I get.

You don't have to do this.

97

BENNY

(PREDESTINED)

Yeah I do, Smalls. I have to.

(in Benny's head)

never go wrong.

We can play forever now.

SCOTTY

MR. MERTLE

Hello?...

SCOTTY

Um, we brought your dog home.

MR. MERTLE

Hercules? How'd he get out?

SCOTTY

Well, sir... um, we kind of, well,

what happened was -

BENNY

- we hit a baseball into your yard.

Then we tried to get it and -

MR. MERTLE

- why didn't you just come to the

door... I'd have gotten it for you.

MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)

Well, thanks for bringin' him back.

(BEAT)

Why don't you boys come in... we can

talk about baseball.

INTO

108

SCOTTY

You knew Babe Ruth?

MR. MERTLE

Yeah. And he knew me too.

(BEAT)

They never let us play together, but

we were friends. Good friends. He was

almost as great a hitter as I was.

But, he'd of told you he was better.

MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)

(HOLDING BALL)

This the one that went over my fence?

BENNY

Yeah.

MR. MERTLE

This is an old ball, boys. Really

old.

(BEAT)

Hercules gave it a good chewing, didn't

he?

SCOTTY

(WEAK)

Yes, sir.

MR. MERTLE

You sound upset, son - what's wrong?

SCOTTY

Well, you see... that ball belongs to

my stepdad... and, uh - it was signed

by Babe Ruth.

109

MR. MERTLE

Hmm. Well, I'm sure your dad will

understand.

SCOTTY

I don't think so.

MR. MERTLE

(TO BENNY)

Son, move Maury Wills to second base

for me, will ya?

MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)

If he steals third that'll be number

100.

(TO SCOTTY)

Helluva pickle you're in, boy.

SCOTTY

Yes, sir...

MR. MERTLE

I'll make you a deal. If you boys

come over once a week and talk baseball

with me, I'll trade you balls.

BENNY

Well, that's really nice of you... but

this ball really is signed by The Babe.

MR. MERTLE

(CHUCKLES)

This one really is too... and all the

rest of the '27 Yankees.

BENNY

Oh my God - Murderers' Row.

BENNY (CONT'D)

(AWED)

Lou Gehrig...

110

SCOTTY

Babe Ruth.

MR. MERTLE

(SMILING)

They're all there.

SCOTTY

Deal.

PORCH

BILL

This better be good.

CUT TO:

NARRATOR

It was weird that Benny said Babe Ruth

was like the Hercules of baseball, and

then The Beast's name turned out to be

Hercules.

(BEAT)

It was also strange that Mr. Mertle

had a Murderers' Row ball to replace

the one signed by The Babe.

111

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

Some people might say that it was all

a coincidence... but looking back at

it now, it seems like everything was

connected, just like me and Benny.

(BEAT)

It was like we were a part of the same

myth as The Babe... the Myth of

Baseball.

MOM

Guys, supper's ready.

DAD

(FORMERLY BILL)

Give us another ten minutes. I'm

helpin' my boy break in his new glove.

HERCULES

NARRATOR

That was the last summer that we all

got to play together.

(MORE)

112

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

But it would stay with us forever.

(as they all dissolve:)

Yeah-Yeah's parents shipped him off to

military school. Timmy and Tommy grew

up to build skyscrapers. Ham went to

college and became a pediatrician.

DeNunez played triple A ball and never

got to the majors. Bertram got really

into the sixities and no one ever saw

him again. Squints grew up and married

Wendy Peffercorn; they bought the Five

& Dime and they still own it to this

day. Hercules lived to be 199 years

old... in human years.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

After Benny pickled the Beast, his

reputation spread all over town. From

then on he was known as Benny "The

Juet" Rodriguez.

THE SANDLOT

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

The nickname stuck with him the rest

of his life.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

(FAMILIAR)

That's a triple, and that'll put the

winning run on third, with two out in

the bottom of the ninth. What a shot!

113

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Lasorda's sending in a pinch runner -

and it'll be...

(DRAMATIC PAUSE)

I don't believe it! Lasorda's calling

up the "Old Man" to pinch-run in the

biggest clutch situation this season!

They say the veteran's lost a step or

two. But if I were you, I'd get ready

for some fireworks.
