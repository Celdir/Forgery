NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

"Movietown News" presents...

Spotlight on Adventure!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

What you are now witnessing is

footage never before seen by

civilized humanity: a lost world in

South America! Lurking in the

shadow of majestic Paradise Falls,

it sports plants and animals

undiscovered by science. Who would

dare set foot on this inhospitable

summit?

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Why, our subject today: Charles

Muntz!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

The beloved explorer lands his

dirigible, the "Spirit of

Adventure," in New Hampshire this

week, completing a year long

expedition to the lost world!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

This lighter-than-air craft was

designed by Muntz himself, and is

longer than 22 Prohibition paddy-

wagons placed end to end.

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And here comes the adventurer now!

2.

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Never apart from his faithful dogs,

Muntz conceived the craft for

canine comfort! It's a veritable

floating palace in the sky...

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

...complete with doggie bath and

mechanical canine walker.

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals

consider Muntz the bee's knees!

And how!

MUNTZ

"Adventure is out there!"

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

But what has Muntz brought back

this time?

MUNTZ

Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster

of Paradise Falls!

CROWD

Ooh!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And golly, what a swell monster

this is. But what's this?

3.

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Scientists cry foul! The National

Explorers Society accuses Muntz of

fabricating the skeleton!

YOUNG CARL

No!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

The organization strips Muntz of

his membership.

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to

Paradise Falls and promises to

capture the beast... alive!

MUNTZ

I promise to capture the beast...

alive!

MUNTZ

And I will not come back until I do!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And so the    explorer is off to clear

his name.     Bon voyage Charles

Muntz, and    good luck capturing the

Monster of    Paradise Falls!

DISSOLVE TO:

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Here's Charles Muntz piloting his

famous dirigible!!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

He hurdles Pike's Peak!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

He hurdles the Grand Canyon!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

He hurdles Mount Everest!

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

He... goes around Mount Everest!

Is there nothing he cannot do?

NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Yes, as Muntz himself says:

"Adventure is--"

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

"Adventure is out there!"

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to

starboard. Must get the Spirit of

Adventure over Mount Rushmore...

5.

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

Hold together old girl. How're my

dogs doing? Ruff ruff!

GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

All engines ahead full! Let's take

her up to 26,000 feet! Rudders

eighteen degrees towards the south.

YOUNG ELLIE

It's a beautiful day, winds out of

the east at ten knots.

Visibility... unlimited.

(yells a command)

Enter the weather in the logbook!

YOUNG ELLIE

Oh! There's something down there!

I will bring it back for science.

Awwww, it's a puppy!

YOUNG ELLIE (O.S.)

No time!   A storm! Lightning! Hail!

6.

YOUNG ELLIE

What are you doing!?!

YOUNG ELLIE

Don't you know this is an exclusive

club? Only explorers get in here.

Not just any kid off the street

with a helmet and a pair of

goggles. Do you think you got what

it takes? Well, do you?!?

YOUNG ELLIE

Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard.

YOUNG ELLIE

What's wrong? Can't you talk?

YOUNG ELLIE

Hey, I don't bite.

YOUNG ELLIE

You and me, we're in a club now.

YOUNG ELLIE

I saw where your balloon went.

Come on, let's go get it!

YOUNG ELLIE

My name's Ellie.

7.

YOUNG ELLIE

There it is.

YOUNG ELLIE

Well, go ahead.

YOUNG ELLIE

Go on.

CUT TO:

YOUNG CARL

(re: arm)

Ow!

YOUNG ELLIE

Hey kid!!

YOUNG CARL

Ow!!

8.

YOUNG ELLIE

Thought you might need a little

cheerin' up. I got somethin' to

show ya!

YOUNG ELLIE

I am about to let you see something

I have never shown to another human

being. Ever. In my life.

YOUNG ELLIE

You'll have to swear you will not

tell anyone.

YOUNG ELLIE

Cross your heart. Do it!

YOUNG ELLIE

My Adventure Book!

YOUNG ELLIE

You know him.

YOUNG ELLIE

Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get

big, I'm going where he's going:

South America.

YOUNG ELLIE

It's like America... but south.

Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

9.

YOUNG ELLIE

(reading caption)

"Paradise Falls, a land lost in

time." I ripped this right out of

a library book.

YOUNG ELLIE

I'm gonna move my clubhouse there,

and park it right next to the

falls. Who knows what lives up

there? And once I get there...

YOUNG ELLIE

Well, I'm saving these pages for

all the adventures I'm gonna have.

Only... I just don't know how I'm

gonna get to Paradise Falls.

YOUNG ELLIE

That's it! You can take us there

in a blimp! Swear you'll take us.

Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross

your heart.

YOUNG ELLIE

Good. You promised. No backing out.

YOUNG ELLIE

Well, see you tomorrow kid!   Bye.

YOUNG ELLIE

"Adventure is out there!!"

10.

YOUNG ELLIE

You know, you don't talk very much.

I like you.

YOUNG CARL

Wow.

14.

FADE TO BLACK.

15.

CARL

Quite a sight, huh Ellie?

(noticing mailbox)

Uhp, mail's here.

16.

CARL

Shady Oaks Retirement.    Oh brother.

CARL

Hm.

CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM

Hey! `Morning, Mr. Fredricksen!

Need any help there?

CARL

No. Yes. Tell your boss over there

that you boys are ruining our house.

CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM

Well just to let you know, my boss

would be happy to take this old

place off your hands, and for

double his last offer. Whaddya say

to that?

CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM

Uh, I take that as a no, then.

CARL

I believe I made my position to

your boss quite clear.

CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM

You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

CARL

Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let

me talk to him.

CARL

(in megaphone)

You in the suit. Yes, you.      Take a

bath, hippy!

17.

CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM

(to Boss, re Carl)

I am not with him!

(to Carl)

This is serious. He's out to get

your house!

CARL

Tell your boss he can have our house.

CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM

Really?

CARL

When I'm dead!

CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM

I'll take that as a maybe!

RUSSELL

"Good afternoon. My name is

Russell. And I am a Wilderness

Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge

12. Are you in need of any

assistance today, sir?"

CARL

No.

18.

RUSSELL

I could help you cross the street.

CARL

No.

RUSSELL

I could help you cross your yard.

CARL

No.

RUSSELL

I could help you cross your... porch?

CARL

No.

RUSSELL

Well, I gotta help you cross

something.

CARL

Uh, no.   I'm doing fine.

RUSSELL

"Good afternoon. My name is

Russell."

CARL

Uh... kid...

RUSSELL

"And I am a Wilderness Explorer in

Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12."

CARL

Kid.   KID!!

RUSSELL

"Are you in need of any assistance

today Sir?"

CARL

Thank you, but I don't need any help!

19.

RUSSELL

Ow.

CARL

(RESIGNED)

Proceed.

RUSSELL

"Good afternoon. My-"

CARL

But skip to the end!

RUSSELL

See these? These are my Wilderness

Explorer badges. You may notice

one is missing. It's my Assisting

the Elderly badge. If I get it I

will become a Senior Wilderness

Explorer!

RUSSELL

"The wilderness must be explored!

CAW-CAW! RAAAR!"

RUSSELL

It's gonna be great! There's a big

ceremony, and all the dads come,

and they pin on our badges...

CARL

So you want to assist an old

person?

RUSSELL

Yep! Then I will be a Senior

Wilderness Explorer!

20.

CARL

(CONSPIRATORIALLY)

You ever heard of a snipe?

RUSSELL

Snipe?

CARL

Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it

sneaks in my yard and gobbles my

poor azaleas. I'm elderly and

infirm. I can't catch it. If only

someone could help me...

RUSSELL

Me! Me!   I'll do it!

CARL

Oh, I don't know, it's awfully

crafty. You'd have to clap your

hands three times to lure it in.

RUSSELL

I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!

CARL

I think its burrow is two blocks

down. If you go past --

RUSSELL

Two blocks down! Got it!

RUSSELL

Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey...

CARL

(calls after Russell)

Bring it back here when you find

it!

CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE

Okay, keep her coming... And...

stop. Stop! STOP!!

21.

CARL

What? Hey! Hey you!         What do you

think you're doing?

CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE

I am so sorry, sir...

CARL

Don't touch that!

CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE

No no, let me take care of that for you.

CARL

(STRUGGLING)

Get away from our mailbox!

CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE

Hey sir, I...

CARL

I don't want you to touch it!

22.

OFFICER EDITH

Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don't

seem like a public menace to me.

Take this.

OFFICER EDITH

The guys from Shady Oaks will be by

to pick you up in the morning, okay?

CARL

What do I do now, Ellie?

23.

MATCH DISSOLVE

TO:

CARL

Morning gentlemen.

NURSE GEORGE

Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.    You

ready to go?

CARL

Ready as I'll ever be. Would you

do me a favor and take this?

CARL

I'll meet you at the van in just a

minute. I... want to say one last

goodbye to the old place.

NURSE GEORGE

Sure.   Take all the time you need, sir.

24.

NURSE A.J.

Typical. He's probably going to the

bathroom for the eightieth time.

NURSE GEORGE

You'd think he'd take better care

of his house.

CARL

So long boys! I'll send you a

postcard from Paradise Falls!

25.

CARL

We're on our way, Ellie.

CARL

Huh?

26.

CARL

Hm.

RUSSELL

Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.    It's me,

Russell.

CARL

What are you doing out here, kid?

RUSSELL

I found the snipe and I followed it

under your porch, but this snipe

had a long tail and looked more

like a large mouse.

RUSSELL

Please let me in?

CARL

No.

CARL

Oh, alright, you can come...

CARL

...in.

27.

RUSSELL

Huh. I've never been in a floating

house before.

RUSSELL

Goggles.   Look at this stuff!

RUSSELL

Wow, you going on a trip?

(reads from the engraving)

"Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in

Time." You going to South America,

Mr. Fredricksen?

CARL

Don't touch that.   You'll soil it.

RUSSELL

You know, most people take a plane,

but you're smart because you'll have

all your TV and clocks and stuff.

RUSSELL

Whoah.   Is this how you steer your

house?   Does it really work?

CARL

Kid, would you stop with the --

RUSSELL

Oh, this makes it go right, and

that way's left.

CARL

Let go of the -- knock it off!

28.

RUSSELL

Hey look, buildings!

RUSSELL

That building's so close I could

almost touch it.

CUT TO:

RUSSELL

Wow! This is great! You should try

this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's

a bus that could take me home two

blocks away!

(looking up)

Hey, I can see your house from here!

CARL

(struggling to hold on)

Don't jerk around so much, kid!

CUT TO:

CARL

Well, that's not gonna work.

RUSSELL

I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo

Nimbus. Did you know that the

Cumulo Nimbus...

29.

CARL

Stayed up all night blowing up

balloons, for what?

RUSSELL

...warm air goes by cool air, and

the airs go by each other and

that's how we get lightning.

CARL

That's nice, kid.

RUSSELL

(nearly silent)

Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big

storm coming. It's starting to get

scary. We're gonna get blown to

bits! We're in big trouble, Mr.

Fredricksen!

CARL

What are you doing over there?

RUSSELL

Look!

RUSSELL

See?    Cumulo Nimbus.

30.

RUSSELL

My pack!

RUSSELL

Got ya!

RUSSELL

Whew!    I thought you were dead.

CARL

Wha... what happened?

RUSSELL

I steered us. I did!      I steered

the house!

CARL

Steered us?

31.

RUSSELL

After you tied your stuff down you

took a nap, so I went ahead and

steered us down here.

CARL

Huh?

CARL

Can't tell where we are.

RUSSELL

Oh we're in South America all

right. It was a cinch, with my

Wilderness Explorer GPS.

CARL

GP-what?

RUSSELL

My dad gave it to me. It shows

exactly where we are on the planet.

With this baby, we'll never be lost!

RUSSELL

Oops.

32.

CARL

We'll get you down, find a bus

stop. You just tell the man you

want to go back to your mother.

RUSSELL

Sure, but I don't think they have

busses in Paradise Falls.

CARL

There. That ought to do it. Here,

I'll give you some change for bus fare.

RUSSELL

Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass.

RUSSELL (O.S.)

Whoah, that's gonna be like a

billion transfers to get back to my

house.

RUSSELL

Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

CARL

Well, we're up pretty high.   Could

take hours to get down.

33.

CARL

(MUMBLING)

...that thing was...building or

something.

RUSSELL

What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

CARL

We can't be close to the ground yet.

CARL

Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't!

CARL

Whoah!   Hey, hey!

CARL

Russell, hang on!

RUSSELL

Whoah!

CARL

Walk back!     Walk back!

34.

RUSSELL

Okay!

CARL

(out of breath)

Where... where are we?

RUSSELL

This doesn't look like the city or

the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.

CARL

(to house)

Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.

CARL

There it is. Ellie, it's so

beautiful.

CARL

We made it. We made it! Russell,

we could float right over there.

Climb up. Climb up!

RUSSELL

You mean assist you?

CARL

Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

RUSSELL

Okay, I'll climb up!

35.

CARL

Watch it.

RUSSELL

Sorry.

CARL

Now, when you get up there, go

ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!

CARL

You on the porch yet?!

CARL

What? That's it?! I came all this

way just to get stuck at the wrong

end of this rock pile? Aw, great!

RUSSELL

Hey, if I could assist you over

there, would you sign off on my

badge?

CARL

What are you talking about?

RUSSELL

We could walk your house to the

falls!

CARL

Walk it?

RUSSELL

Yeah, after all, we weigh it down.

We could walk it right over there.

Like a parade balloon.

36.

CARL

Now, we're gonna walk to the falls

quickly and quietly, with no rap

music or flash-dancing.

RUSSELL

(DISTRACTED)

Uh-huh.

CARL

We have three days, at best, before

the helium leaks out of those

balloons. And if we're not at the

falls when that happens...

RUSSELL

Sand!

CARL

...we're not getting to the falls!

RUSSELL

I found sand!

CARL

Don't you worry, Ellie.    We'll get

our house over there.

RUSSELL

Huh.

(shrugs it off)

This is fun already, isn't it? By

the time we get there, you're gonna

feel so assisted... Oh, Mr.

Fredricksen, if we happen to get

separated, use the Wilderness

Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!!

37.

RUSSELL

Wait. Why are we going to Paradise

Falls again?

CARL

Hey, let's play a game. It's

called: "See who can be quiet the

longest."

RUSSELL

Cool!   My mom loves that game!

DISSOLVE TO:

38.

CARL

Darn thing.

(calling back)

C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?

RUSSELL

I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts.

CARL

Which knee?

RUSSELL

My elbow hurts and I have to go to

the bathroom.

CARL

I asked you about that five minutes

ago!

RUSSELL

Well, I didn't have to go then!

RUSSELL

I don't want to walk anymore.     Can

we stop?

CARL

Russell! If you don't hurry up,

the tigers will eat you.

RUSSELL

There's no tigers in South America.

RUSSELL

Zoology.

CARL

Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into

the bushes and do your business.

RUSSELL

Okay!   Here, hold my stuff.

39.

RUSSELL

I've always wanted to try this!

RUSSELL (O.S.)

Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to

dig the hole before or after?

CARL

Eugh!   None of my concern!

RUSSELL (O.S.)

Oh.    It's before!

RUSSELL

Huh?  Tracks?!

(REALIZING)

Snipe!

RUSSELL

Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe.

Snipe!

RUSSELL

Huh.

40.

RUSSELL

Ha! Gotcha!

RUSSELL

Don't be afraid, little snipe. I

am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a

friend to all of nature. Want some

more?

RUSSELL

Hi boy.    Don't eat it all.   Come on

out.

RUSSELL

Come on. Don't be afraid little

snipe. Nice snipe. Good little

snipe. Nice...

RUSSELL

...giant snipe!

RUSSELL

I found the snipe!

CARL

(humoring him)

Oh, did you?

RUSSELL

Are they tall?

CARL

Oh yes, they're very tall.

41.

RUSSELL

Do they have a lot of colors?

CARL

They do indeed.

RUSSELL

Do they like chocolate?

CARL

Oh ye-   Chocolate?

CARL

What is that thing?!

RUSSELL

It's a snipe!

CARL

There's no such thing as a snipe!

RUSSELL

But you said snipes eat--

RUSSELL

Whoah!

CARL

Go on, get out of here. Go on!

Shoo!

RUSSELL

(LAUGHING)

Whoah! Whoah!

42.

CARL

Careful, Russell!

RUSSELL

(LAUGHING)

Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes

me!

CARL

Russell!

RUSSELL

(LAUGHING)

No stop, that tickles!

CARL

Get out of here.    Go on, git!

CARL

Aaaah!

RUSSELL

Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's

okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice!

CARL

"Kevin"?

RUSSELL

Yeah, that's his name I just gave

him.

CARL

Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!

CARL

Hey!   That's mine!

43.

CARL

Aaah!   Shoo, shoo! Get out of here.

CARL

Go on, beat it.

RUSSELL

Can we keep him? Please?? I'll

get the food for him, I'll walk

him, I'll change his newspapers...

CARL

No.

RUSSELL

(RECITING)

"An Explorer is a friend to all, be

it plants or fish or tiny mole."

CARL

That doesn't even rhyme.

RUSSELL

Yeah it does.

RUSSELL

Hey, look!     Kevin!

CARL

What? Get down! You're not

allowed up there!

CARL

You come down here right now!

CARL

Sheesh!   Can you believe this, Ellie?

RUSSELL

Ellie?

(gets idea)

(MORE)

44.

RUSSELL (cont'd)

Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the

bird? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

(to Carl)

She said for you to let me.

CARL

(to Ellie)

But I told him no --

(catches himself)

I told you no! N-O.

CARL

I see you back there!

CARL

Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go

annoy someone else for a while.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey, are you okay over there?

CARL

Uh, hello?

CARL

Oh!   Hello sir!    Thank goodness.

CARL

It's nice to know someone else is

up here!

VOICE

I can smell you.

45.

CARL

What?    You can smell us?

VOICE

I can smell you.

CARL

Hey.

RUSSELL

You were talking to a rock.

RUSSELL

Hey, that one looks like a turtle!

RUSSELL

Look at that one!     That one looks

like a dog!

RUSSELL

It is a dog!

CARL

What?

RUSSELL

Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs

in my apartment.

RUSSELL

Hey, I like dogs!

CARL

(calls out)

We have your dog!

(to self)

Wonder who he belongs to?

RUSSELL

Sit boy.

46.

RUSSELL

Hey look, he's trained!    Shake!

RUSSELL

Uh-huh.    Speak.

DUG

Hi there.

CARL

Did that dog just say "Hi there?"

DUG

Oh yes.

DUG

My name is Dug. I have just met

you and I love you.

CARL

Uh..wha?

DUG

My master made me this collar. He

is a good and smart master and he

made me this collar so that I may

talk -- SQUIRREL!!

DUG

My master is good and smart.

CARL

It's not possible.

DUG

Oh it is, because my master is

smart.

47.

RUSSELL

Cool! What do these do, boy?

DUG

Hey would you-

(CLICK)

-cuerdo con tigo-

(CLICK)

I use that collar-

(CLICK)

-watashi wa hanashi ma-

(CLICK)

-to talk with, I would be happy if

you stopped.

CARL

Russell, don't touch that. It could

be radioactive or something.

DUG

I am a great tracker. My pack sent

me on a special mission all by

myself. Have you seen a bird? I

want to find one and I have been on

the scent. I am a great tracker,

did I mention that?

DUG

Hey, that is the bird! I have

never seen one up close but this is

the bird.

(to Carl)

May I take your bird back to camp

as my prisoner?

CARL

Yes! Take it! And on the way,

learn how to bark like a real dog!

DUG

Oh I can bark!

DUG

And here's howling!

48.

RUSSELL

Can we keep him? Please please

please?

CARL

No.

RUSSELL

But it's a talking dog!

CARL

It's just a weird trick or

something. Let's get to the falls.

DUG

Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh

please be my prisoner.

GAMMA

Oh, here it is.    I picked up the

bird's scent!

BETA

Wait a minute, wait a minute! What

is this? Chocolate. I smell

chocolate.

GAMMA

I'm getting prunes and denture

cream! Who are they?

BETA

Ah man, Master will not be pleased.

We'd better tell him someone took

the bird, right Alpha?

ALPHA

(high-pitched voice)

No. Soon enough the bird will be

ours yet again.

49.

ALPHA (CONT'D)

Find the scent, my compadres and

you two shall have much rewardings

from Master for the toil factor you

wage.

BETA

Hey Alpha, I think there's

something wrong with your collar.

You must have bumped it.

GAMMA

Yeah, your voice sounds funny!

ALPHA

Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire

to -- SQUIRREL!

ALPHA (CONT'D)

Mayhaps you desire to challenge the

ranking that I have been assigned

by my strength and cunning?

BETA

No no. But maybe Dug would.     You

might want to ask him.

GAMMA

Yeah, I wonder if he's found the

bird on his very special mission.

ALPHA

Do not mention Dug to me at this

time. His fool's errand will keep

him most occupied, most occupied

indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not

agree with that which I am saying

to you now?

BETA

Sure, but the second Master finds

out you sent Dug out by himself,

none of us will get a treat.

50.

ALPHA

You are wise, my trusted

Lieutenant.

ALPHA (CONT'D)

This is Alpha calling Dug.   Come

in, Dug.

DUG

Hi Alpha.    Hey, your voice sounds

funny.

ALPHA

I know, I know!   Have you seen the

bird?

DUG

Why yes, the bird is my prisoner

now.

GAMMA

Yeah, right.

ALPHA

Impossible! Where are you?!

DUG

I am here with the bird and I will

bring it back and then you will

like me. Oh, gotta go.

RUSSELL

(on video screen)

Hey Dug! Who you talking to?

BETA

What's Dug doing?

GAMMA

Why's he with that small mailman?

51.

BETA

Where are they?

ALPHA

There he is. Come on!

DUG

Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my

prisoner!

RUSSELL

Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

DUG

That man there says I can take the

bird and I love that man there like

he is my master.

CARL

I am not your master!

DUG

I am warning you, once again, bird!

RUSSELL

Hey!     Quit it!

DUG

I am jumping on you now, bird.

CARL

Russell! At this rate we'll never

get to the falls!

52.

CARL

I am nobody's master, got it?

(points to bird)

I don't want you here,

(points to Dug)

...and I don't want you here.

(points to Russell)

I'm stuck with you. And if you two

don't clear out of here by the time

I count to three-

DUG

A ball!   Oh boy oh boy!     A ball!

CARL

Ball?

CARL

You want it boy?     Huh?   Huh?   Yeah?

DUG

Oh oh oh! Yes, I do.        I do ever so

want the ball!

CARL

Go get it!!

DUG

Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and

then bring it back!

CARL

(WHISPERS)

Quick Russell, give me some chocolate.

RUSSELL

Why?

CARL

Just give it to me!

CARL

Bird.   Bird!

53.

CARL

C'mon Russell!

RUSSELL

Wait.   Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

CARL

Daah!

CARL

Aaahh...

RUSSELL

What are we doing?

RUSSELL

Hey, uh, we're pretty far now.

Kevin's gonna miss me.

54.

CARL

I think that did the trick.

DUG

Hi, Master.

CARL

Afternoon.

CARL

Well, thanks for keeping us dry

anyway, Ellie.

RUSSELL (O.S.)

Which one's the front?

RUSSELL

Is this step three, or step five?

RUSSELL

There!

RUSSELL

All done.

55.

RUSSELL

(pointing to tent)

That's for you!

RUSSELL

Awh.   Tents are hard.

CARL

Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness

Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges?

RUSSELL

Yeah, but... can I tell you a

secret?

CARL

No.

RUSSELL

Alright, here goes. I never

actually built a tent before.

There. I said it.

CARL

You've been camping before, haven't

you?

RUSSELL

Well, never outside.

CARL

Well, why didn't you ask your Dad

how to build a tent?

RUSSELL

I don't think he wants to talk

about this stuff.

CARL

Why don't you try him sometime?

Maybe he'll surprise you.

RUSSELL

Well, he's away a lot.   I don't see

him much.

CARL

He's got to be home sometime.

56.

RUSSELL

Well, I called, but Phyllis told me

I bug him too much.

CARL

Phyllis? You call your own mother

by her first name?

RUSSELL

Phyllis isn't my mom.

CARL

Oh.

RUSSELL

But he promised he'd come to my

Explorer ceremony to pin on my

Assisting the Elderly badge, so he

can show me about tents then,

right?

CARL

Hey, uh, why don't you get some

sleep. Don't want to wake up the

traveling flea circus.

RUSSELL

Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants

to take Kevin prisoner. We have to

protect him!

RUSSELL

Can Kevin go with us?

CARL

Alright.   He can come.

RUSSELL

Promise you won't leave him?

CARL

Yeah.

57.

RUSSELL

Cross your heart?

CARL

Cross my heart.

CARL

What have I got myself into, Ellie?

DISSOLVE TO:

CARL

Morning Sweetheart.

CARL

We better get moving.

CARL

Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell

won't notice.

(calls out)

Alright, everybody up!

RUSSELL

Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!

Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

DUG

Find the bird.    Find the bird...

POINT!

58.

RUSSELL

Oh, look! There he is.

DUG

POINT!

CARL

Hey, that's my food!   Get off my

roof!

DUG

Yeah, get off of his !

CARL

What is it doing?

DUG

The bird is calling to her babies.

RUSSELL

Her babies! Kevin's a girl?

DUG

Her house is over there in those

twisty rocks.

DUG

She has been gathering food for her

babies and must get back to them.

RUSSELL

Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But

you promised to protect her!

RUSSELL

Her babies need her, we gotta make

sure they're together.

59.

CARL

Sorry Russell. We've lost enough

time already.

RUSSELL

Yeah...

RUSSELL

This was her favorite chocolate.

Because you sent her away, there's

more for you.

CARL

Huh?

RUSSELL

Kevin?

ALPHA

(high-pitched voice)

Where's the bird? You said you had

the bird.

DUG

Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have

said that, I can see how you would

think that.

60.

ALPHA

Where is it?

DUG

Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow

and then I will again have the

bird. Yes.

ALPHA

You lost it. Why do I not have a

surprised feeling? Well, at least

you now have lead us to the small

mailman and The One Who Smells of

Prunes.

ALPHA

Master will be most pleased we have

found them, and will ask of them

many questions.

(commanding, to Carl)

Come!

CARL

Wait, we're not going with you.

We're going to the falls!

CARL

Get away from me! Get down!

61.

VOICE (O.S.)

Stay!

VOICE

You came here in that?

CARL

Uh... yeah.

VOICE

In a house? A floating house?

VOICE

That is the darndest thing I've

ever seen! You're not after my

bird, are you? But if you need to

borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy

to oblige!

VOICE

Well, this is all a misunderstanding.

My dogs made a mistake.

CARL

Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!

MUNTZ

Well... Yes.

62.

CARL

The Charles Muntz?

MUNTZ

"Adventure is out there!"

CARL

It's really him!

(to Russell)

That's Charles Muntz!

RUSSELL

(EXCITED)

It is?!?

(CONSIDERS)

Who's Charles Muntz?

CARL

Him!

DOG WALLA

Yes!    It is him! He is!

CARL

I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and

I, we were your biggest fans!

MUNTZ

Well, you're a man of good taste!

MUNTZ

You must be tired.     Hungry?

RUSSELL

Uh-huh.

MUNTZ

(to dogs)

Attention everyone! These people

are no longer intruders. They are

our guests.

63.

DOG WALLA

Follow me! I like you temporarily.

You do smell like prunes. I will

not bite you.

CARL

Wow.

MUNTZ (O.S.)

I'm sorry about the dogs -- hope

they weren't too rough on you.

GAMMA (O.S.)

We weren't!

MUNTZ

Go ahead and moor your airship

right next to mine.

CARL

We're not actually going inside the

"Spirit of Adventure" itself?!

MUNTZ

Oh.    Would you like to?

CARL

Would I?!?!

CARL

Wait up, Mr. Muntz!

CARL

Jiminy Cricket.

BETA

Not you.

64.

GAMMA

What do we do with Dug?

ALPHA

He has lost the bird.     Put him in

the Cone of Shame.

DUG

I do not like the Cone of Shame.

MUNTZ

Most of the collection is housed in

the world's top museums: New York,

Munich, London... `Course I kept

the best for myself.

CARL

Did you ever! Will you look at that?

MUNTZ

Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast

charged while I was brushing my

teeth. Used my shaving kit to

bring him down.

MUNTZ

Oh, surprise me.

(to Carl)

Only way to get it out of Ethiopia

at the time was to have it declared

as "dental equipment!"

65.

CARL

Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian

Leopard Tortoise!

MUNTZ

Oh, you recognize it? I'm

impressed! That's an interesting

story there...

MUNTZ

Hm, excellent choice.

(to Carl)

I found it on safari with

Roosevelt.

MUNTZ

He and I fell into a habit of

playing gin rummy in the evenings.

And did he cheat? Oh, he was

horrible!

ALPHA

(high-pitched voice)

Master, dinner is ready.

MUNTZ

Oh dear, broken translator.   It's

that loose wire again.

(leans down, fixes it)

There you go big fella.

ALPHA

(deep scary voice)

Thank you Master.

RUSSELL

I liked his other voice.

MUNTZ

Well, dinner is served!    Right this

way.

66.

MUNTZ

So how are things stateside?

Almost tempted to go back a few

times, but I have unfinished work

here... Please.

MUNTZ

I hope you're hungry because

Epsilon is the finest chef I've

ever had.

MUNTZ

Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

RUSSELL

Yes!!

RUSSELL

Hey!

RUSSELL

Hey!

CARL

Oh my Ellie would have loved all

this. You know, it's because of

you she had this dream to come down

here and live by Paradise Falls.

67.

MUNTZ

I'm honored. And now you've made

it!

CARL

You're sure we're not a bother?

I'd hate to impose.

MUNTZ

No no! It's a pleasure to have

guests -- a real treat.

DOG WALLA

Treat?!   Treat! I want a treat!

MUNTZ

No no, quiet! Calm down.     Calm

down...

RUSSELL

Hey!

MUNTZ

(CONT'D)

Shouldn't've used that word...

Having guests is a delight. More

often I get thieves, come to steal

what's rightfully mine.

CARL

No!

MUNTZ

They called me a fraud, those...

dah! But once I bring back this

creature, my name will be cleared.

MUNTZ

Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a

lifetime tracking it. Sometimes

years go by between sightings...

(MORE)

68.

MUNTZ (cont'd)

I've tried to smoke it out of that

deathly labyrinth where it lives...

Can't go in after it. Once in,

there's no way out. Lost so many

dogs...

MUNTZ

And here they come, these bandits,

and think the bird is theirs to

take! But they soon find that this

mountain is a very dangerous

place.

RUSSELL

Hey, that looks like Kevin!

MUNTZ

"Kevin?"

RUSSELL

Yeah! That's my new giant bird

pet. I trained it to follow us.

MUNTZ

Follow you? Impossible.      How?

RUSSELL

She likes chocolate.

MUNTZ

Chocolate?

RUSSELL

Yeah, I gave her some of my

chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it.

CARL

But it ran off!      It's gone now.

69.

MUNTZ

You know, Carl. These people who

pass through here, they all tell

pretty good stories. A "Surveyor"

making a map.

MUNTZ

A "Botanist" cataloguing plants.

MUNTZ

An old man taking his house to

Paradise Falls.

MUNTZ

That's the best one yet. I can't

wait to hear how it ends.

CARL

Well! It's been a wonderful

evening, but we'd better be going.

MUNTZ

Oh, you're not leaving?

CARL

We don't want to take advantage of

your hospitality. Come on Russell.

RUSSELL

But we haven't even had dessert

yet.

70.

MUNTZ

No, the boy's right. You haven't

had dessert. Epsilon here makes a

delicious Cherries Jubilee.

MUNTZ

Oh, you really must stay. I

insist! We have so much more to

talk about!

RUSSELL

Kevin?

MUNTZ

It's here.

MUNTZ

(to dogs)

Get them!

CARL

Hurry!

RUSSELL

I am hurrying!

RUSSELL

They're coming!

DUG (O.S.)

Master, over here!

71.

DUG

Go toward the light, master!

CARL

Russell!

CARL

Get back!!

DUG

Go on Master!       I will stop the

dogs!

72.

DUG

Stop you dogs!!

RUSSELL

Help! Help!

CARL

Gimme your hand!

RUSSELL

Hang on to Kevin!

RUSSELL (O.S.)

Kevin!

73.

RUSSELL

No no no! Kevin! Stay down.

(to Carl)

She's hurt real bad. Can't we help

her get home?

CARL

Alright.   But we've got to hurry.

MUNTZ

You lost them?

BETA

Uh, it was Dug.

GAMMA

Yeah, he's with them.    He helped

them escape!

MUNTZ

Wait.   Wait a minute.   Dug...

CUT TO:

74.

CARL

See anything?

DUG

No, my pack is not following us!

Boy they are dumb.

CARL

This is crazy. I finally meet my

childhood hero and he's trying to

kill us! What a joke.

DUG

Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel

walks up to a tree and says I

forgot to store acorns for winter

and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny

because the squirrel gets dead.

CARL

Careful Russell.

RUSSELL

You okay, Kevin?

RUSSELL

You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?

The wilderness isn't quite what I

expected.

CARL

Yeah?   How so?

RUSSELL

It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's

not how they made it sound in my

book.

CARL

Hmm, get used to that, kid.

75.

RUSSELL

My dad made it sound so easy. He's

really good at camping, and how to

make fire from rocks and stuff. He

used to come to all my Sweatlodge

meetings.

RUSSELL

And afterwards we'd go get ice

cream at Fentons. I always get

chocolate and he gets butter-

brickle. Then we'd sit on this one

curb, right outside, and I'll count

all the blue cars and he counts all

the red ones, and whoever gets the

most, wins. I like that curb.

RUSSELL

That might sound boring, but I

think the boring stuff is the stuff

I remember the most.

RUSSELL

Look, there it is!

CARL

Hold on Russell, stand still!

CARL

Look at that bird go!

CARL

Wait up, you overgrown chicken!

76.

RUSSELL

That's it, go Kevin!      Go find your

babies!

RUSSELL

Run Kevin! Run!

RUSSELL

Oh no!

CARL

Russell, give me your knife!

MUNTZ (O.S.)

Get away from my bird!

CARL

No!

RUSSELL

No!

77.

MUNTZ

Careful. We want her in good shape

for my return.

RUSSELL

Let her go! Stop!

RUSSELL

Kevin!

RUSSELL

You gave away Kevin.   You just gave

her away.

CARL

This is none of my concern.      I

didn't ask for any of this!

DUG

Master.   It's alright.

CARL

I am not your master! And if you

hadn't a shown up, none of this

would have happened! Bad dog! Bad

dog!

CARL

Now, whether you assist me or not,

I am going to Paradise Falls if it

kills me.

78.

RUSSELL (O.S.)

Here.

RUSSELL

I don't want this anymore.

79.

"THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE!

LOVE, ELLIE."

CARL

Russell?

80.

CARL

Russell!

RUSSELL

I'm gonna help Kevin even if you

won't!

CARL

No, Russell! No!

CUT TO:

CARL

Wahhoo!

81.

CARL

Russell?

CARL

Dug!

DUG

I was hiding under your porch

because I love you. Can I stay?

CARL

Can you stay? Well, you're my dog

aren't you? And I'm your master!

DUG

You are my master?!

DUG

Oh boy.     Oh boy!

CARL (O.S.)

Good boy, Dug. You're a good boy!

82.

RUSSELL

Ooph!

RUSSELL

Yes!    Don't worry Kevin! I'll save -

MUNTZ

And they wouldn't believe me. Just

wait till they get a look at you.

ALPHA

Master! The small mailman has

returned.

MUNTZ

What?

RUSSELL

Let me go!

MUNTZ

Where's your elderly friend?

RUSSELL

He's not my friend anymore.

83.

MUNTZ

Well, if you're here, Fredricksen

can't be far behind.

RUSSELL

Where are you keeping Kevin!?

RUSSELL

Let me go!

BETA

Scream all you want, small mailman.

GAMMA

None of your mailman friends can

hear you.

RUSSELL

I'll unleash all my Wilderness

Explorer training!

MUNTZ

Alpha! Fredricksen's coming back.

Guard that bird. If you see the

old man, you know what to do.

RUSSELL

Hey, where are you going?    I'm not

finished with you!

MUNTZ

Nice talking with you.

84.

MUNTZ

Where are you, Fredricksen?

CARL

Russell!

RUSSELL

Mr. Fredricksen!

CARL

Dug!   Bring `er over!

85.

RUSSELL

You came back for Kevin!     Let's go

get her.

CARL

I'm getting Kevin.    You stay here!

RUSSELL

But I want to help!

CARL

I don't want your help.     I want you

safe!

CARL

How do we get past these dogs?

DUG

Uh... POINT!

CARL

Kevin!

CARL

Don't worry Kevin, we're on our

way!

86.

ALPHA

Allow no one to be entering through

these doors. Guard well that bird,

my minions.

CARL

(WHISPERS)

What do we do now, Dug?

CARL

Who wants the ball?

DOGS

Me! I do! I want the ball!

CARL

Then go get it!

DOGS

I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna

get the ball! I'm gonna get it!

GAMMA

I got it!!

GAMMA

Uh-oh.

87.

CARL

I'm sorry Kevin.      Let's get you out

of here.

DOG WALLA

(on radio)

Master! He's gone! The old man!

He's here! He's got the bird! The

bird's gone!

MUNTZ

What?    Calm down!   One at a time!

RUSSELL

I want to help!

RUSSELL

Ha ha!

DOG WALLA

He's in Hall D! He's in Hall B!

It's the old man!

88.

MUNTZ

Does anyone know where they are?!?!

RUSSELL

Whoooaaah!

MUNTZ

(into radio)

Grey leader! Take down the house!

BETA

(into radio)

Grey leader, checking in.

GAMMA

Grey 2, checking in.

OMEGA

Grey 3, checking in.

BETA

Target sighted.

89.

CARL

Come on, Kevin.

DUG

Hi.

MUNTZ

Any last words, Fredricksen?   Come

on, spit it out!

90.

CARL

Come on!

MUNTZ

Enough! I'm taking that bird back

with me alive or dead!

CARL

Come on, Kevin!

91.

ALPHA

I will have many enjoyments for

what I am about to do, Dug.

MISC DOG

He wears the Cone of Shame!

ALPHA

(high-pitched voice)

What? Do not just continue

sitting! Attack!

ALPHA

(high pitched voice)

No! No! Stop your laughing! Get

this off of me!

DUG

Listen you dog!     Sit!

DOG WALLA

Yes, Alpha.

92.

DUG

Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is-

(REALIZING)

Oohhhh!

RUSSELL

(out of breath)

I can't do it!

CARL

(far in the distance)

Russell!

RUSSELL

Huh?

RUSSELL

You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!

RUSSELL

Hey!

(pointing down)

Squirrel!

GAMMA

Squirrel?

OMEGA

Where's the squirrel?!

93.

GAMMA

I hate squirrels.

CARL

Dug!

DUG

Master!

CARL

Russell!! Over here!!    Let's go!

RUSSELL

Mr. Fredricksen!

CARL

Come on, Kevin!

94.

CARL

No!

CARL

Russell!   Get out of there!

CARL

No!    Leave them alone!

95.

CARL

Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't

let go of her!

CARL

Kevin!   Chocolate!

96.

RUSSELL

That was cool!

CARL

Don't jerk around so much, kid!

DUG

Oh I am ready to not be up high.

RUSSELL

Sorry about your house, Mr.

Fredricksen.

CARL

You know, it's just a house.

DISSOLVE TO:

CARL

Ow! Ow! Ow!

RUSSELL

Look at you. You're so soft.

97.

CARL/RUSSELL

(DISAPPOINTED)

Awwww!

RUSSELL

I wish I could keep one.

CARL

Huh, where's my cane?      I just had

it here...

CARL

You know what? Keep `em.       A little

gift from me to you.

RUSSELL

Bye Kevin!

RUSSELL

Ready?

CARL

Ready!
