IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE

"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE"

By

Frances Goodrich

Albert Hackett

Frank Capra

Jo Swerling

GOWER'S VOICE

I owe everything to George Bailey.

Help him, dear Father.

MARTINI'S VOICE

Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend

Mr. Bailey.

MRS. BAILEY'S VOICE

Help my son George tonight.

BERT'S VOICE

He never thinks about himself, God;

that's why he's in trouble.

ERNIE'S VOICE

George is a good guy. Give him a

break, God.

MARY'S VOICE

I love him, dear Lord. Watch over

him tonight.

JANIE'S VOICE

Please, God. Something's the matter

with Daddy.

ZUZU'S VOICE

Please bring Daddy back.

FRANKLIN'S VOICE

Hello, Joseph, trouble?

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Looks like we'll have to send someone

down  a lot of people are asking

for help for a man named George

Bailey.

FRANKLIN'S VOICE

George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his

crucial night. You're right, we'll

have to send someone down immediately.

Whose turn is it?

JOSEPH'S VOICE

That's why I came to see you, sir.

It's that clock-maker's turn again.

FRANKLIN'S VOICE

Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings

yet, has he? We've passed him up

right along.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Because, you know, sir, he's got the

I.Q. of a rabbit.

FRANKLIN'S VOICE

Yes, but he's got the faith of a

child  simple. Joseph, send for

Clarence.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

You sent for me, sir?

FRANKLIN'S VOICE

Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth

needs our help.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Splendid! Is he sick?

FRANKLIN'S VOICE

No, worse. He's discouraged. At

exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight,

Earth time, that man will be thinking

seriously of throwing away God's

greatest gift.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've

only got an hour to dress. What are

they wearing now?

FRANKLIN'S VOICE

You will spend that hour getting

acquainted with George Bailey.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Sir... If I should accomplish this

mission  I mean  might I perhaps

win my wings?  I've been waiting for

over two hundred years now, sir

and people are beginning to talk.

FRANKLIN'S VOICE

What's that book you've got there?

CLARENCE'S VOICE

The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

FRANKLIN'S VOICE

Clarence, you do a good job with

George Bailey, and you'll get your

wings.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Poor George... Sit down.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Sit down? What are...

JOSEPH'S VOICE

If you're going to help a man, you

want to know something about him,

don't you?

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Well, naturally. Of course.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Well, keep your eyes open. See the

town?

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Where? I don't see a thing.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your

wings yet. Now look, I'll help you

out.  Concentrate. Begin to see

something?

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Why, yes. This is amazing.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

If you ever get your wings, you'll

see all by yourself.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Oh, wonderful!

BOY

(as he slides)

Yippee!!

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Hey, who's that?

JOSEPH'S VOICE

That's your problem, George Bailey.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

A boy?

JOSEPH'S VOICE

That's him when he was twelve, back

in 1919. Something happens here you'll

have to remember later on.

GEORGE

(through megaphone)

And here comes the scare-baby, my

kid brother, Harry Bailey.

HARRY

I'm not scared.

BOYS

(ad lib)

Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry!

GEORGE

I'm coming, Harry.

GEORGE

Make a chain, gang! A chain!

JOSEPH'S VOICE

George saved his brother's life that

day.  But he caught a bad cold which

infected his left ear. Cost him his

hearing in that ear. It was weeks

before he could return to his after-

school job at old man Gower's

drugstore.

DISSOLVE

GEORGE

Mr. Potter!

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Who's that  a king?

JOSEPH'S VOICE

That's Henry F. Potter, the richest

and meanest man in the county.

GEORGE

So long!

BOYS

(ad lib)

Got to work, slave. Hee-haw. Hee-

haw.

GEORGE

Wish I had a million dollars.

GEORGE

Hot dog!

GEORGE

(calling toward back

room)

It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

GOWER

You're late.

GEORGE

Yes, sir.

VIOLET

(with warm friendliness)

Hello, George.

(then, flatly, as she

sees Mary)

'Lo, Mary.

MARY

(primly)

Hello, Violet.

GEORGE

Two cents worth of shoelaces?

VIOLET

She was here first.

MARY

I'm still thinking.

GEORGE

(to Violet)

Shoelaces?

VIOLET

Please, Georgie.

VIOLET

(to Mary)

I like him.

MARY

You like every boy.

VIOLET

(happily)

What's wrong with that?

GEORGE

Here you are.

VIOLET

(the vamp)

Help me down?

GEORGE

(disgusted)

Help you down!

GEORGE

Made up your mind yet?

MARY

I'll take chocolate.

GEORGE

With coconuts?

MARY

I don't like coconuts.

GEORGE

You don't like coconuts!  Say,

brainless, don't you know where

coconuts come from?  Lookit here

from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral

Sea!

MARY

A new magazine! I never saw it before.

GEORGE

Of course you never. Only us explorers

can get it. I've been nominated for

membership in the National Geographic

Society.

MARY

Is this the ear you can't hear on?

George Bailey, I'll love you till

the day I die.

GEORGE

I'm going out exploring some day,

you watch. And I'm going to have a

couple of harems, and maybe three or

four wives.  Wait and see.

GOWER

George! George!

GEORGE

Yes, sir.

GOWER

You're not paid to be a canary.

GEORGE

No, sir.

GEORGE

Mr. Gower, do you want something...

Anything?

GOWER

No.

GEORGE

Anything I can do back here?

GOWER

No.

GEORGE

I'll get them, sir.

GOWER

Take these capsules over to Mrs.

Blaine's.  She's waiting for them.

GEORGE

Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria

there, haven't they, sir?

GOWER

Ummmm...

GEORGE

Is it a charge, sir?

GOWER

Yes  charge.

GEORGE

Mr. Gower, I think...

GOWER

Aw, get going!

GEORGE

Yes, sir.

UNCLE BILLY

Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where

you headin'?

GEORGE

Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.

UNCLE BILLY

Some other time, George.

GEORGE

It's important.

UNCLE BILLY

There's a squall in there that's

shapin' up into a storm.

COUSIN TILLY

Uncle Billy... telephone.

UNCLE BILLY

Who is it?

COUSIN TILLY

Bank examiner.

UNCLE BILLY

Bank examiner!  I should have called

him yesterday. Switch it inside.

BAILEY

I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

POTTER

Well, you're begging, and that's a

whole lot worse.

BAILEY

All I'm asking is thirty days more...

GEORGE

(interrupting)

Pop!

BAILEY

Just a minute, son.

(to Potter)

Just thirty short days. I'll dig up

that five thousand somehow.

POTTER

(to his goon)

Shove me up...

GEORGE

Pop!

POTTER

Have you put any real pressure on

those people of yours to pay those

mortgages?

BAILEY

Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of

these people are out of work.

POTTER

Then foreclose!

BAILEY

I can't do that. These families have

children.

GEORGE

Pop!

POTTER

They're not my children.

BAILEY

But they're somebody's children.

POTTER

Are you running a business or a

charity ward?

BAILEY

Well, all right...

POTTER

(interrupting)

Not with my money!

BAILEY

Mr. Potter, what makes you such a

hardskulled character? You have no

family  no children. You can't begin

to spend all the money you've got.

POTTER

So I suppose I should give it to

miserable failures like you and that

idiot brother of yours to spend for

me.

GEORGE

He's not a failure! You can't say

that about my father!

BAILEY

George, George...

GEORGE

You're not! You're the biggest man

in town!

BAILEY

Run along.

GEORGE

Bigger'n him!

GEORGE

Bigger'n everybody.

POTTER

Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

GEORGE

Don't let him say that about you,

Pop.

BAILEY

All right, son, thanks. I'll talk to

you tonight.

WIPE TO:

GOWER

(drunkenly)

Why, that medicine should have been

there an hour ago. It'll be over in

five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.

GOWER

Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

GEORGE

Capsules...

GOWER

(shaking him)

Did you hear what I said?

GEORGE

(frightened)

Yes, sir, I...

GOWER

What kind of tricks are you playing,

anyway? Why didn't you deliver them

right away? Don't you know that boy's

very sick?

GEORGE

(in tears)

You're hurting my sore ear.

GOWER

You lazy loafer!

GEORGE

(sobbing)

Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're

doing. You put something wrong in

those capsules. I know you're unhappy.

You got that telegram, and you're

upset. You put something bad in those

capsules. It wasn't your fault, Mr.

Gower...

GEORGE

Just look and see what you did. Look

at the bottle you took the powder

from. It's poison!  I tell you, it's

poison!  I know you feel bad... and...

GEORGE

Don't hurt my sore ear again.

GOWER

No... No... No...

GEORGE

Don't hurt my ear again!

GOWER

(sobbing)

Oh, George, George...

GEORGE

Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.

I know what you're feeling. I won't

ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I

won't.

GOWER

Oh, George.

DISSOLVE TO:

JOE

An overnight bag  genuine English

cowhide, combination lock, fitted up

with brushes, combs...

CUSTOMER

Nope.

GEORGE

Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Now, look,

Joe.  Now, look, I... I want a big

one.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

What did you stop it for?

JOSEPH'S VOICE

I want you to take a good look at

that face.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Who is it?

JOSEPH'S VOICE

George Bailey.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Oh, you mean the kid that had his

ears slapped back by the druggist.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

That's the kid.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

It's a good face. I like it. I like

George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever

tell anyone about the pills?

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Not a soul.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Did he ever marry the girl? Did he

ever go exploring?

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Well, wait and see.

GEORGE

Big - see!  I don't want one for one

night.  I want something for a

thousand and one nights, with plenty

of room for labels from Italy and

Baghdad, Samarkand... a great big

one.

JOE

I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't

suppose you'd like this old second-

hand job, would you?

GEORGE

Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could

use this as a raft in case the boat

sunk. How much does this cost?

JOE

No charge.

GEORGE

That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded

as if you said no charge.

JOE

(indicating name on

suitcase)

That's right.

GEORGE

(as he sees his name)

What's my name doing on it?

JOE

A little present from old man Gower.

Came down and picked it out himself.

GEORGE

(admiring the bag)

He did? Whatta you know about that

my old boss...

JOE

What boat you sailing on?

GEORGE

I'm working across on a cattle boat.

JOE

A cattle boat?

GEORGE

(as he exits)

Okay, I like cows.

WIPE TO:

GEORGE

Mr. Gower... Mr. Gower... thanks

ever so much for the bag. It's just

exactly what I wanted.

GOWER

Aw, forget it.

GEORGE

Oh, it's wonderful.

GOWER

Hope you enjoy it.

GEORGE

Oh... Oh. Wish I had a million

dollars.

GEORGE

Hot dog!

UNCLE BILLY

Avast there, Captain Cook. You got

your sea legs yet?

COUSIN EUSTACE

Parlez-vous francais? Hey, send us

some of them picture postcards, will

you, George?

UNCLE BILLY

Hey, George, don't take any plugged

nickels.

COUSIN TILLY

Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

George waves up at them and continues

on across the street.

GEORGE

Hey, Ernie!

ERNIE

Hiya, George!

GEORGE

Hi, Bert.

BERT

George...

GEORGE

Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How

about driving me home in style?

ERNIE

Sure, your highness, hop in. And,

for the carriage trade, I puts on my

hat.

VIOLET

Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

GEORGE

Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good.

That's some dress you got on there.

VIOLET

Oh, this old thing? Why, I only wear

it when I don't care how I look.

ERNIE

How would you like...

GEORGE

(as he enters cab)

Yes...

ERNIE

Want to come along, Bert?  We'll

show you the town!

BERT

No, thanks. Think I'll go home and

see what the wife's doing.

ERNIE

Family man.

DISSOLVE TO:

MOTHER

(calling out)

George! Harry! You're shaking the

house down! Stop it!

POP

Oh, let 'em alone. I wish I was up

there with them.

MOTHER

Harry'll tear his dinner suit. George!

ANNIE

That's why all children should be

girls.

MOTHER

But if they were all girls, there

wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.

(calling upstairs)

George! Harry! Come down to dinner

this minute. Everything's getting

cold and you know we've been waiting

for you.

GEORGE'S VOICE

Okay, Mom.

BOYS

Here's a present for you, Pop.

MOTHER

Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down

and have dinner.

HARRY

I've eaten.

MOTHER

Well, aren't you going to finish

dressing for your graduation party?

Look at you.

HARRY

I don't care. It's George's tux.

ANNIE

If you lay a hand on me, I'll hit

you with this broom.

HARRY

Annie, I'm in love with you. There's

a moon out tonight.

GEORGE

Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy  my last meal

at the old Bailey boarding house.

MOTHER

Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!

HARRY

Pop, can I have the car? I'm going

to take over a lot of plates and

things.

MOTHER

What plates?

HARRY

Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats

committee and we only need a couple

of dozen.

MOTHER

Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my

best Haviland.

GEORGE

Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

POP

Hope you have a good trip, George.

Uncle Billy and I are going to miss

you.

GEORGE

I'm going to miss you, too, Pop.

What's the matter? You look tired.

POP

Oh, I had another tussle with Potter

today.

GEORGE

Oh...

POP

I thought when we put him on the

Board of Directors, he'd ease up on

us a little bit.

GEORGE

I wonder what's eating that old money

grubbing buzzard anyway?

POP

Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and

sick.  Sick in his mind, sick in his

soul, if he has one. Hates everybody

that has anything that he can't have.

Hates us mostly, I guess.

HARRY

Gangway! Gangway! So long, Pop.

POP

So long, son.

GEORGE

Got a match?

HARRY

Very funny. Very funny.

MOTHER

Put those things in the car and I'll

get your tie and studs together.

HARRY

Okay, Mom. You coming later? You

coming later, George?

GEORGE

What do you mean, and be bored to

death?

HARRY

Couldn't want a better death. Lots

of pretty girls, and we're going to

use that new floor of yours tonight,

too.

GEORGE

I hope it works.

POP

No gin tonight, son.

HARRY

Aw, Pop, just a little.

POP

No, son, not one drop.

ANNIE

Boys and girls and music. Why do

they need gin?

GEORGE

Father, did I act like that when I

graduated from high school?

POP

Pretty much. You know, George, wish

we could send Harry to college with

you. Your mother and I talked it

over half the night.

GEORGE

We have that all figured out. You

see, Harry'll take my job at the

Building and Loan, work there four

years, then he'll go.

POP

He's pretty young for that job.

GEORGE

Well, no younger than I was.

POP

Maybe you were born older, George.

GEORGE

How's that?

POP

I say, maybe you were born older. I

suppose you've decided what you're

going to do when you get out of

college.

GEORGE

Oh, well, you know what I've always

talked about  build things... design

new buildings  plan modern cities

all that stuff I was talking about.

POP

Still after that first million before

you're thirty.

GEORGE

No, I'll settle for half that in

cash.

POP

Of course, it's just a hope, but you

wouldn't consider coming back to the

Building and Loan, would you?

GEORGE

Well, I...

(to Annie)

Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?

Then you'd be more comfortable and

you could hear everything that's

going on.

ANNIE

I would if I thought I'd hear anything

worth listening to.

GEORGE

You would, huh?

POP

I know it's soon to talk about it.

GEORGE

Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't

face being cooped up for the rest of

my life in a shabby little office.

GEORGE

Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean

that remark, but this business of

nickels and dimes and spending all

your life trying to figure out how

to save three cents on a length of

pipe... I'd go crazy. I want to do

something big and something important.

POP

(quietly)

You know, George, I feel that in a

small way we are doing something

important.  Satisfying a fundamental

urge. It's deep in the race for a

man to want his own roof and walls

and fireplace, and we're helping him

get those things in our shabby little

office.

GEORGE

(unhappily)

I know, Dad. I wish I felt... But

I've been hoarding pennies like a

miser in order to... Most of my

friends have already finished college.

I just feel like if I don't get away,

I'd bust.

POP

Yes... Yes... You're right, son.

GEORGE

You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

POP

This town is no place for any man

unless he's willing to crawl to

Potter. You've got talent, son. You

get yourself an education. Then get

out of here.

GEORGE

Pop, do you want a shock? I think

you're a great guy.

GEORGE

Oh, did you hear that, Annie?

ANNIE

I heard it. About time one of you

lunkheads said it.

GEORGE

I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I

think I'll get dressed and go over

to Harry's party.

POP

Have a good time, son.

WIPE TO:

GEORGE

Here you are.

HARRY

(introducing George)

You know my kid brother, George. I'm

going to put him through college.

SAM

Here comes George. Hello, hee-haw!

GEORGE

Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you?

When did you get here?

SAM

Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd

give the kids a treat.

GEORGE

Old college graduate now, huh?

SAM

Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright,

they call me. Well, freshman, looks

like you're going to make it after

all.

GEORGE

Yep.

SAM

(to Harry)

Harry! You're the guy I want to see.

Coach has heard all about you.

HARRY

He has?

SAM

Yeah. He's followed every game and

his mouth's watering. He wants me to

find out if you're going to come

along with us.

HARRY

Well, I gotta make some dough first.

SAM

Well, you better make it fast. We

need great ends like you  not broken

down old guys like this one.

GEORGE

Hee-haw!

SAM

Hee-haw!

PRINCIPAL

George, welcome back.

GEORGE

Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

PRINCIPAL

Putting a pool under this floor was

a great idea. Saved us another

building.  Now, Harry, Sam, have a

lot of fun.  There's lots of stuff

to eat and drink.  Lots of pretty

girls around.

VIOLET

Hey, George...

GEORGE

Hello, Violet.

VIOLET

Hello, what am I bid?

MARTY

George.

GEORGE

Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home

week.

MARTY

Do me a favor, will you, George?

GEORGE

What's that?

MARTY

Well, you remember my kid sister,

Mary?

GEORGE

Oh, yeah, yeah.

SAM

"Momma wants you, Marty." "Momma

wants you, Marty." Remember?

MARTY

Dance with her, will you?

GEORGE

Oh... me? Oh, well, I feel funny

enough already, with all these kids.

MARTY

Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance

with her one time and you'll give

her the thrill of her life.

SAM

Aw, go on.

MARTY

(calling off)

Hey, sis.

GEORGE

Well, excuse me, Violet. Don't be

long, Marty. I don't want to be a

wet nurse for...

FREDDIE'S VOICE

And the next thing I know, some guy

came up and tripped me. That's the

reason why I came in fourth. If it

hadn't been for that...

FREDDIE'S VOICE

...that race would have been a cinch.

I tried to find out who it was

later...

FREDDIE'S VOICE

...but I couldn't find out. Nobody'd

ever tell you whoever it was because

they'd be scared. They know...

FREDDIE

...what kind of...

MARTY

(interrupting)

You remember George? This is Mary.

Well, I'll be seeing you.

GEORGE

Well... Well... Well...

FREDDIE

Now, to get back to my story, see...

FREDDIE

Hey, this is my dance!

GEORGE

Oh, why don't you stop annoying

people?

FREDDIE

Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

GEORGE

Well, hello.

MARY

Hello. You look at me as if you didn't

know me.

GEORGE

Well, I don't.

MARY

You've passed me on the street almost

every day.

GEORGE

Me?

MARY

Uh-huh.

GEORGE

Uh-uh. That was a little girl named

Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

HARRY

Oyez  oyez  oyez... The big

Charleston contest. The prize? A

genuine loving cup.  Those not tapped

by the judges will remain on the

floor. Let's go!

GEORGE

I'm not very good at this.

MARY

Neither am I.

GEORGE

Okay  what can we lose?

MICKEY

What's the matter, Othello  jealous?

Did you know there's a swimming pool

under this floor? And did you know

that button behind you causes this

floor to open up?  And did you further

know that George Bailey is dancing

right over that crack?  And I've got

the key?

GEORGE

They're cheering us. We must be good.

FADE OUT

GEORGE AND MARY

(singing)

Buffalo Gals can't you come out

tonight.  Can't you come out tonight.

Can't you come out tonight. Buffalo

Gals can't you come out tonight and

dance by the light of the moon.

GEORGE

Hot dog! Just like an organ.

MARY

Beautiful.

GEORGE

And I told Harry I thought I'd be

bored to death. You should have seen

the commotion in that locker room. I

had to knock down three people to

get this stuff we're wearing here.

Here, let me hold that old wet dress

of yours.

MARY

Do I look as funny as you do?

GEORGE

I guess I'm not quite the football

type.  You... look wonderful. You

know, if it wasn't me talking I'd

say you were the prettiest girl in

town.

MARY

Well, why don't you say it?

GEORGE

I don't know. Maybe I will say it.

How old are you anyway?

MARY

Eighteen.

GEORGE

Eighteen? Why, it was only last year

you were seventeen.

MARY

Too young or too old?

GEORGE

Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits

you.  Yes, sir, you look a little

older without your clothes on.

GEORGE

I mean, without a dress. You look

older...  I mean, younger. You look

just...

GEORGE

Oh-oh...

MARY

(holding out her hand)

Sir, my train, please.

GEORGE

A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

GEORGE

Your... your caboose, my lady.

MARY

You may kiss my hand.

GEORGE

Ummmmm...

GEORGE

Hey  hey, Mary.

MARY

(singing)

As I was lumbering down the street...

GEORGE

Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the

old Granville house.

MARY

Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

GEORGE

No. You see, you make a wish and

then try and break some glass. You

got to be a pretty good shot nowadays,

too.

MARY

Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of

romance, that old place. I'd like to

live in it.

GEORGE

In that place?

MARY

Uh-huh.

GEORGE

I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.

Now watch... right on the second

floor there.

MARY

What'd you wish, George?

GEORGE

Well, not just one wish. A whole

hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going

to do tomorrow and the next day and

the next year and the year after

that. I'm shaking the dust of this

crummy little town off my feet and

I'm going to see the world. Italy,

Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum.

Then I'm coming back here and go to

college and see what they know...

and then I'm going to build things.

I'm gonna build air fields.  I'm

gonna build skyscrapers a hundred

stories high. I'm gonna build bridges

a mile long...

GEORGE

Are you gonna throw a rock?

GEORGE

Hey, that's pretty good. What'd you

wish, Mary?

MARY

(singing)

Buffalo Gals, can't you come out

tonight...

MARY AND GEORGE

(singing)

...can't you come out tonight, can't

you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals

can't you come out tonight and dance

by the light of the moon.

GEORGE

What'd you wish when you threw that

rock?

MARY

Oh, no.

GEORGE

Come on, tell me.

MARY

If I told you it might not come true.

GEORGE

What is it you want, Mary? What do

you want? You want the moon? Just

say...

GEORGE

...the word and I'll throw a lasso

around it and pull it down. Hey,

that's a pretty good idea. I'll give

you the moon, Mary.

MARY

I'll take it. And then what?

GEORGE

Well, then you could swallow it and

it'd all dissolve, see? And the

moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers

and your toes, and the ends of your

hair.

(pauses)

Am I talking too much?

MAN

Yes!! Why don't you kiss her instead

of talking her to death?

GEORGE

How's that?

MAN

Why don't you kiss her instead of

talking her to death?

GEORGE

Want me to kiss her, huh?

MAN

Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong

people.

GEORGE

Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, mister, come

on back out here, and I'll show you

some kissing that'll put hair back

on your head. What are you...

GEORGE

(looking around)

Mary...

GEORGE

Okay, I give up. Where are you?

MARY

Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

GEORGE

Here you are. Catch.

GEORGE

Wait a minute. What am I doing? This

is a very interesting situation.

MARY

(from the bushes)

Please give me my robe.

GEORGE

Hmm... A man doesn't get in a

situation like this every day.

MARY

(impatiently)

I'd like to have my robe.

GEORGE

Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

MARY

Ouch!

GEORGE

Gesundheit. This requires a little

thought here.

MARY

(getting mad)

George Bailey! Give me my robe!

GEORGE

I've heard about things like this,

but I've never...

MARY

(interrupting)

Shame on you. I'm going to tell your

mother on you.

GEORGE

Oh, my mother's way up the corner

there.

MARY

(desperate)

I'll call the police.

GEORGE

They're way downtown. They'd be on

my side, too.

MARY

I'm going to scream!

GEORGE

(thoughtfully)

Maybe I could sell tickets. Let's

see. No, the point is, in order to

get this robe...  I've got it! I'll

make a deal with you, Mary.

UNCLE BILLY

George! George! Come on home, quick!

Your father's had a stroke!

GEORGE

Mary... Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to

go.

HARRY

Come on, George, let's hurry.

GEORGE

Did you get a doctor?

UNCLE BILLY

Yes, Campbell's there now.

FADE OUT

DR. CAMPBELL

I think that's all we'll need you

for, George. I know you're anxious

to make a train.

GEORGE

(rising)

I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

DR. CAMPBELL

I want the Board to know that George

gave up his trip to Europe to help

straighten things out here these

past few months.  Good luck to you

at school, George.

GEORGE

Thanks.

DR. CAMPBELL

Now we come to the real purpose of

this meeting  to appoint a successor

to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.

POTTER

Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my

real purpose.

MAN

Wait just a minute now.

POTTER

Wait for what?  I claim this

institution is not necessary to this

town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I

make a motion to dissolve this

institution and turn its assets and

liabilities over to the receiver.

UNCLE BILLY

(angrily)

George, you hear what that buzzard...

LAWYER

Mr. Chairman, it's too soon after

Peter Bailey's death to discuss

chloroforming the Building and Loan.

MAN

Peter Bailey died three months ago.

I second Mr. Potter's motion.

DR. CAMPBELL

Very well. In that case I'll ask the

two executive officers to withdraw.

DR. CAMPBELL

But before you go, I'm sure the whole

board wishes to express its deep

sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey.

GEORGE

Thank you very much.

DR. CAMPBELL

It was his faith and devotion that

are responsible for this organization.

POTTER

I'll go further than that. I'll say

that to the public Peter Bailey was

the Building and Loan.

UNCLE BILLY

(trying to control

himself)

Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from

you, considering that you probably

drove him to his grave.

POTTER

Peter Bailey was not a business man.

That's what killed him. Oh, I don't

mean any disrespect to him, God rest

his soul.  He was a man of high

ideals, so-called, but ideals without

common sense can ruin this town.

(picking up papers

from table)

Now, you take this loan here to Ernie

Bishop... You know, that fellow that

sits around all day on his brains in

his taxi.  You know... I happen to

know the bank turned down this loan,

but he comes here and we're building

him a house worth five thousand

dollars. Why?

GEORGE

Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

You have all the papers there. His

salary, insurance. I can personally

vouch for his character.

POTTER

(sarcastically)

A friend of yours?

GEORGE

Yes, sir.

POTTER

You see, if you shoot pool with some

employee here, you can come and borrow

money. What does that get us? A

discontented, lazy rabble instead of

a thrifty working class. And all

because a few starry-eyed dreamers

like Peter Bailey stir them up and

fill their heads with a lot of

impossible ideas. Now, I say...

GEORGE

Just a minute  just a minute. Now,

hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right

when you say my father was no business

man. I know that. Why he ever started

this cheap, penny-ante Building and

Loan, I'll never know. But neither

you nor anybody else can say anything

against his character, because his

whole life was... Why, in the twenty-

five years since he and Uncle Billy

started this thing, he never once

thought of himself. Isn't that right,

Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough

money to send Harry to school, let

alone me. But he did help a few people

get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

And what's wrong with that? Why...

Here, you're all businessmen here.

Doesn't it make them better citizens?

Doesn't it make them better customers?

You... you said... What'd you say

just a minute ago?... They had to

wait and save their money before

they even ought to think of a decent

home. Wait! Wait for what? Until

their children grow up and leave

them?  Until they're so old and broken-

down that they... Do you know how

long it takes a working man to save

five thousand dollars?  Just remember

this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble

you're talking about... they do most

of the working and paying and living

and dying in this community. Well,

is it too much to have them work and

pay and live and die in a couple of

decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my

father didn't think so. People were

human beings to him, but to you, a

warped, frustrated old man, they're

cattle. Well, in my book he died a

much richer man than you'll ever be!

POTTER

I'm not interested in your book. I'm

talking about the Building and Loan.

GEORGE

I know very well what you're talking

about. You're talking about something

you can't get your fingers on, and

it's galling you. That's what you're

talking about, I know.

(to the Board)

Well, I've said too much. I... You're

the Board here. You do what you want

with this thing. Just one thing more,

though. This town needs this measly

one-horse institution if only to

have some place where people can

come without crawling to Potter.

Come on, Uncle Billy!

POTTER

Sentimental hogwash! I want my

motion...

UNCLE BILLY

Boy, oh, boy, that was telling him,

George, old boy. You shut his big

mouth.

(to Cousin Tilly and

Cousin Eustace)

You should have heard him.

COUSIN EUSTACE

What happened? We heard a lot of

yelling.

UNCLE BILLY

Well, we're being voted out of

business after twenty-five years.

Easy come, easy go.

COUSIN TILLY

(reading a newspaper)

Here it is, "Help Wanted  Female."

ERNIE

You still want me to hang around,

George?

GEORGE

(looking at his watch)

Yeah, I'll be right down.

UNCLE BILLY

Hey, you'll miss your train. You're

a week late for school already. Go

on.

GEORGE

(indicating Board

room)

I wonder what's going on in there?

UNCLE BILLY

Oh, never mind. Don't worry about

that.  They're putting us out of

business. So what? I can get another

job. I'm only fifty-five.

COUSIN TILLY

Fifty-six!

UNCLE BILLY

Go on  go on. Hey, look, you gave

up your boat trip, now you don't

want to miss college too, do you?

DR. CAMPBELL

George! George! They voted Potter

down!  They want to keep it going!

UNCLE BILLY

Whoopee!

DR. CAMPBELL

But they've got one condition  only

one condition.

GEORGE

What's that?

DR. CAMPBELL

That's the best part of it. They've

appointed George here as executive

secretary to take his father's place.

GEORGE

Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...

DR. CAMPBELL

You can keep him on. That's all right.

As secretary you can hire anyone you

like.

GEORGE

(emphatically)

Dr. Campbell, now let's get this

thing straight. I'm leaving. I'm

leaving right now. I'm going to

school. This is my last chance. Uncle

Billy here, he's your man.

DR. CAMPBELL

But, George, they'll vote with Potter

otherwise.

LAP DISSOLVE

CLARENCE'S VOICE

I know. I know. He didn't go.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

That's right. Not only that, but he

gave his school money to his brother

Harry, and sent him to college. Harry

became a football star  made second

team All American.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Yes, but what happened to George?

LAP DISSOLVE

JOSEPH'S VOICE

George got four years older, waiting

for Harry to come back and take over

the Building and Loan.

GEORGE

Oh, there are plenty of jobs around

for somebody that likes to travel.

Look at this.

(takes some folders

from his pocket)

There... Venezuela oil fields

wanted, man with construction

experience. Here's the Yukon, right

here  wanted, man with engineering

experience.

GEORGE

Thar she blows. You know what the

three most exciting sounds in the

world are?

UNCLE BILLY

Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch

is served; dinner...

GEORGE

No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane

motors, and train whistles.

UNCLE BILLY

Peanut?

WIPE TO:

GEORGE

(joyously)

There's the professor now! Old

professor, Phi Beta Kappa Bailey!

All American!

HARRY

Well, if it isn't old George

Geographic Explorer Bailey! What? No

husky dogs? No sled?

(to Uncle Billy)

Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a

bit.

UNCLE BILLY

Nobody ever changes around here. You

know that.

GEORGE

Oh, am I glad to see you.

HARRY

Say, where's Mother?

GEORGE

She's home cooking the fatted calf.

Come on, let's go.

HARRY

Oh, wait. Wait... Wait a minute.

GEORGE

Hello.

UNCLE BILLY

How do you do.

HARRY

Ruth Dakin.

RUTH

Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

UNCLE BILLY

Huh?

HARRY

Well, I wired you I had a surprise.

Here she is. Meet the wife.

UNCLE BILLY

Well, what do you know  wife.

GEORGE

Well, how do you do. Congratulations.

Congratulations. What am I doing?

GEORGE

Harry, why didn't you tell somebody?

(to Ruth)

What's a pretty girl like you doing

marrying this two-headed brother of

mine?

RUTH

(smiling)

Well, I'll tell you. It's purely

mercenary. My father offered him a

job.

UNCLE BILLY

(as he moves off)

Oh, he gets you and a job? Well,

Harry's cup runneth over.

HARRY

George... about that job. Ruth spoke

out of turn. I never said I'd take

it. You've been holding the bag here

for four years, and... well, I won't

let you down, George.  I would like

to... Oh, wait a minute. I forgot

the bags. I'll be right back.

UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE

It was a surprise to me. This is the

new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife.

Old, old friend of the family.

RUTH'S VOICE

Oh, of course. I've heard him speak

of you.

UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE

And I want to tell you, we're going

to give the biggest party this town

ever saw.

RUTH

(to George)

Here, have some popcorn. George,

George, George... that's all Harry

ever talks about.

GEORGE

(quietly)

Ruth, this... what about this job?

RUTH

Oh, well, my father owns a glass

factory in Buffalo. He wants to get

Harry started in the research

business.

GEORGE

Is it a good job?

RUTH

Oh, yes, very. Not much money, but a

good future, you know. Harry's a

genius at research. My father fell

in love with him.

GEORGE

And you did, too?

WIPE TO:

UNCLE BILLY

Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy. I feel so

good I could spit in Potter's eye. I

think I will. What did you say, huh?

Oh, maybe I'd better go home.

UNCLE BILLY

Where's my hat? Where's my...

UNCLE BILLY

Oh, thank you, George. Which one is

mine?

GEORGE

(laughing)

The middle one.

UNCLE BILLY

Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old

boy.  Now, look  if you'll point me

in the right direction... would you

do that?  George?

GEORGE

Right down here.

UNCLE BILLY

Old Building and Loan pal, huh...

GEORGE

Now you just turn this way and go

right straight down.

UNCLE BILLY

That way, huh?

UNCLE BILLY'S VOICE

I'm all right. I'm all right. "...

the sweetest flower that grows... "

GEORGE

Hello, Mom.

MRS. BAILEY

(as she kisses him)

That's for nothing. How do you like

her?

GEORGE

She's swell.

MRS. BAILEY

Looks like she can keep Harry on his

toes.

GEORGE

Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

MRS. BAILEY

Did you know that Mary Hatch is back

from school?

GEORGE

Uh-huh.

MRS. BAILEY

Came back three days ago.

GEORGE

Hmmmm...

MRS. BAILEY

Nice girl, Mary.

GEORGE

Hmmmm...

MRS. BAILEY

Kind that will help you find the

answers, George.

GEORGE

Hmmm...

MRS. BAILEY

Oh, stop that grunting.

GEORGE

Hmmm...

MRS. BAILEY

Can you give me one good reason why

you shouldn't call on Mary?

GEORGE

Sure  Sam Wainwright.

MRS. BAILEY

Hmmm?

GEORGE

Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.

MRS. BAILEY

Well, she's not crazy about him.

GEORGE

Well, how do you know? Did she discuss

it with you?

MRS. BAILEY

No.

GEORGE

Well then, how do you know?

MRS. BAILEY

Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why,

she lights up like a firefly whenever

you're around.

GEORGE

Oh...

MRS. BAILEY

And besides, Sam Wainwright's away

in New York, and you're here in

Bedford Falls.

GEORGE

And all's fair in love and war?

MRS. BAILEY

(primly)

I don't know about war.

GEORGE

Mother, you know, I can see right

through you  right back to your

back collar button... trying to get

rid of me, huh?

MRS. BAILEY

Uh-huh.

GEORGE

Well, here's your hat, what's your

hurry?  All right, Mother, old

Building and Loan pal, I think I'll

go out and find a girl and do a little

passionate necking.

MRS. BAILEY

Oh, George!

GEORGE

Now, if you'll just point me in the

right direction... This direction?

(as he leaves)

Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

WIPE TO:

VIOLET

(to the two men)

Excuse me...

MAN

Now, wait a minute.

VIOLET

I think I got a date. But stick

around, fellows, just in case, huh?

MAN

We'll wait for you, baby.

VIOLET

Hello, Georgie-Porgie.

GEORGE

Hello, Vi.

VIOLET

What gives?

GEORGE

Nothing.

VIOLET

Where are you going?

GEORGE

Oh, I'll probably end up down at the

library.

VIOLET

George, don't you ever get tired of

just reading about things?

GEORGE

Yes... what are you doing tonight?

VIOLET

(feigned surprise)

Not a thing.

GEORGE

Are you game, Vi? Let's make a night

of it.

VIOLET

(just what she wanted)

Oh, I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we

do?

GEORGE

Let's go out in the fields and take

off our shoes and walk through the

grass.

VIOLET

Huh?

GEORGE

Then we can go up to the falls. It's

beautiful up there in the moonlight,

and there's a green pool up there,

and we can swim in it. Then we can

climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the

pines, and watch the sunrise against

the peaks, and... we'll stay up there

the whole night, and everybody'll be

talking and there'll be a terrific

scandal...

VIOLET

(interrupting)

George, have you gone crazy? Walk in

the grass in my bare feet? Why, it's

ten miles up to Mt. Bedford.

GEORGE

Shhh...

VIOLET

(angrily)

You think just because you...

GEORGE

Okay, just forget about the whole

thing.

WIPE TO:

MARY

What are you doing, picketing?

GEORGE

Hello, Mary. I just happened to be

passing by.

MARY

Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up

your mind?

GEORGE

How's that?

MARY

Have you made up your mind?

GEORGE

About what?

MARY

About coming in. Your mother just

phoned and said you were on your way

over to pay me a visit.

GEORGE

My mother just called you? Well, how

did she know?

MARY

Didn't you tell her?

GEORGE

I didn't tell anybody. I just went

for a walk and happened to be passing

by...

GEORGE

(to himself)

What do you... went for a walk, that's

all.

MARY

(calling off)

I'll be downstairs, mother.

MRS. HATCH'S VOICE

All right, dear.

MARY

Well, are you coming in or aren't

you?

GEORGE

Well, I'll come in for a minute, but

I didn't tell anybody I was coming

over here.

GEORGE

When did you get back?

MARY

Tuesday.

GEORGE

Where'd you get that dress?

MARY

Do you like it?

GEORGE

It's all right. I thought you'd go

back to New York like Sam and Ingie,

and the rest of them.

MARY

Oh, I worked there for a couple of

vacations, but I don't know... I

guess I was homesick.

GEORGE

(shocked)

Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

MARY

Yes, and my family and... oh,

everything.  Would you like to sit

down?

GEORGE

All right, for a minute. I still

can't understand it though. You know

I didn't tell anybody I was coming

here.

MARY

Would you rather leave?

GEORGE

No, I don't want to be rude.

MARY

Well, then, sit down.

GEORGE

(indicating cartoon)

Some joke, huh?

GEORGE

Well, I see it still smells like

pine needles in here.

MARY

Thank you.

MARY

(singing)

"And dance by the light..."

GEORGE

What's the matter? Oh, yeah... yeah...

GEORGE

Well, I...

MARY

(desperately)

It was nice about your brother Harry,

and Ruth, wasn't it?

GEORGE

Oh... yeah, yeah. That's all right.

MARY

Don't you like her?

GEORGE

Well, of course I like her. She's a

peach.

MARY

Oh, it's just marriage in general

you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

GEORGE

No, marriage is all right for Harry,

and Marty, and Sam and you.

MRS. HATCH

Mary! Mary!

MRS. HATCH'S VOICE

Who's down there with you?

MARY

It's George Bailey, Mother.

MRS. HATCH'S VOICE

George Bailey? What's he want?

MARY

I don't know.

(to George)

What do you want?

GEORGE

(indignant)

Me? Not a thing. I just came in to

get warm.

MARY

(to mother)

He's making violent love to me,

Mother.

MRS. HATCH'S VOICE

You tell him to go right back home,

and don't you leave the house, either.

Sam Wainwright promised to call you

from New York tonight.

GEORGE

(heatedly)

But your mother needn't... you know

I didn't come here to... to... to...

MARY

(rising)

What did you come here for?

GEORGE

I don't know. You tell me. You're

supposed to be the one that has all

the answers.  You tell me.

MARY

(terribly hurt)

Oh, why don't you go home?

GEORGE

(almost shouting)

That's where I'm going. I don't know

why I came here in the first place!

Good night!

MARY

(to George)

Good night!

MRS. HATCH'S VOICE

Mary! Mary! The telephone! It's Sam!

MARY

(almost weeping)

I'll get it.

MRS. HATCH

Mary, he's waiting!

MARY

Hello.

GEORGE

I forgot my hat.

MARY

(overly enthusiastic)

Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

SAM'S VOICE

Aw, great. Gee, it's good to hear

your voice again.

MARY

Oh, well, that's awfully sweet of

you, Sam.

(glances toward door,

sees George still

there)

There's an old friend of yours here.

George Bailey.

SAM

You mean old moss-back George?

MARY

Yes, old moss-back George.

SAM'S VOICE

Hee-haw! Put him on.

MARY

Wait a minute. I'll call him.

(calling)

George!

MRS. HATCH

He doesn't want to speak to George,

you idiot!

MARY

He does so. He asked for him.

(calling)

Geo... George, Sam wants to speak to

you.

GEORGE

Hello, Sam.

SAM

(into phone)

Well, George Baileyoffski! Hey, a

fine pal you are. What're you trying

to do? Steal my girl?

GEORGE

(into phone)

What do you mean? Nobody's trying to

steal your girl. Here... here's Mary.

SAM'S VOICE

No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I

want to talk to both of you. Tell

Mary to get on the extension.

GEORGE

(to Mary)

Here. You take it. You tell him.

MARY

Mother's on the extension.

MARY

We can both hear. Come here.

MARY

(on phone)

We're listening, Sam.

SAM'S VOICE

I have a big deal coming up that's

going to make us all rich. George,

you remember that night in Martini's

bar when you told me you read

someplace about making plastics out

of soybeans?

GEORGE

Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah... soybeans.

Yeah.

SAM'S VOICE

Well, Dad's snapped up the idea.

He's going to build a factory outside

of Rochester. How do you like that?

GEORGE

Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

SAM'S VOICE

Well, why not? Can you think of

anything better?

GEORGE

Oh, I don't know... why not right

here?  You remember that old tool

and machinery works? You tell your

father he can get that for a song.

And all the labor he wants, too.

Half the town was thrown out of work

when they closed down.

SAM'S VOICE

That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey,

that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew

you'd come through. Now, here's the

point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this

too. Now listen.  Have you got any

money?

GEORGE

Money? Yeah... well, a little.

SAM'S VOICE

Well, now listen. I want you to put

every cent you've got into our stock,

you hear?  And George, I may have a

job for you; that is, unless you're

still married to that broken-down

Building and Loan. This is the biggest

thing since radio, and I'm letting

you in on the ground floor. Oh,

Mary...  Mary...

MARY

(nervously)

I'm here.

SAM'S VOICE

Would you tell that guy I'm giving

him the chance of a lifetime, you

hear? The chance of a lifetime.

MARY

(whispering)

He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

GEORGE

(fiercely)

Now you listen to me! I don't want

any plastics! I don't want any ground

floors, and I don't want to get

married  ever  to anyone! You

understand that? I want to do what I

want to do. And you're... and

you're...

GEORGE

Oh, Mary... Mary...

MARY

George... George... George...

GEORGE

Mary...

WIPE TO:

COUSIN TILLY

Here they come!

MRS. BAILEY

First Harry, now George. Annie, we're

just two old maids now.

ANNIE

You speak for yourself, Mrs. B.

ERNIE

If either of you two see a stranger

around here, it's me.

GEORGE

Hey, look! Somebody's driving this

cab.

ERNIE

Bert, the cop, sent this over. He

said to float away to Happy Land on

the bubbles.

GEORGE

Oh, look at this. Champagne!

MARY

Good old Bert.

ERNIE

By the way, where are you two going

on this here now honeymoon?

GEORGE

Where are we going?

(takes out a fat roll

of bills)

Look at this. There's the kitty,

Ernie.  Here, come on, count it,

Mary.

MARY

I feel like a bootlegger's wife.

(holding up the money)

Look!

GEORGE

You know what we're going to do?

We're going to shoot the works. A

whole week in New York. A whole week

in Bermuda. The highest hotels  the

oldest champagne  the richest caviar

the hottest music, and the prettiest

wife!

ERNIE

That does it! Then what?

GEORGE

(to Mary)

Then what, honey?

MARY

After that, who cares?

GEORGE

That does it  come here.

ERNIE

Don't look now, but there's something

funny going on over there at the

bank, George, I've never really seen

one, but that's got all the earmarks

of a run.

PASSERBY

Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in

the bank, you better hurry.

MARY

George, let's not stop. Let's go!

GEORGE

Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh...

MARY

Please, let's not stop, George.

GEORGE

I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

GEORGE

Hello, everybody. Mrs. Thompson, how

are you? Charlie? What's the matter

here, can't you get in?

GEORGE

What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

UNCLE BILLY

George...

GEORGE

Come on in, everybody. That's right,

just come in.

GEORGE

Now look, why don't you all sit down.

There are a lot of seats over there.

Just make yourselves at home.

UNCLE BILLY

George, can I see you a minute?

GEORGE

Why didn't you call me?

UNCLE BILLY

I just did, but they said you left.

This is a pickle, George, this is a

pickle.

GEORGE

All right now, what happened? How

did it start?

UNCLE BILLY

How does anything like this ever

start?  All I know is the bank called

our loan.

GEORGE

When?

UNCLE BILLY

About an hour ago. I had to hand

over all our cash.

GEORGE

All of it?

UNCLE BILLY

Every cent of it, and it still was

less than we owe.

GEORGE

Holy mackerel!

UNCLE BILLY

And then I got scared, George, and

closed the doors. I... I... I...

GEORGE

The whole town's gone crazy.

UNCLE BILLY

Yes, hello? George... it's Potter.

GEORGE

Hello?

POTTER

George, there is a rumor around town

that you've closed your doors. Is

that true?  Oh, well, I'm very glad

to hear that...  George, are you all

right? Do you need any police?

GEORGE

(on phone)

Police? What for?

POTTER

Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes,

you know. George, I'm going all out

to help in this crisis. I've just

guaranteed the bank sufficient funds

to meet their needs.  They'll close

up for a week, and then reopen.

GEORGE

(to Uncle Billy)

He just took over the bank.

POTTER

I may lose a fortune, but I'm willing

to guarantee your people too. Just

tell them to bring their shares over

here and I will pay them fifty cents

on the dollar.

GEORGE

(furiously)

Aw, you never miss a trick, do you,

Potter? Well, you're going to miss

this one.

POTTER

If you close your doors before six

P.M. you will never reopen.

UNCLE BILLY

George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh,

I wanted to be there.

GEORGE

Yeah...

(looks at string on

Uncle Billy's finger)

...you can take this one off now.

GEORGE

Now, just remember that this thing

isn't as black as it appears.

GEORGE

I have some news for you, folks.

I've just talked to old man Potter,

and he's guaranteed cash payments at

the bank. The bank's going to reopen

next week.

ED

But, George, I got my money here.

CHARLIE

Did he guarantee this place?

GEORGE

Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask

him.  We don't need Potter over here.

CHARLIE

I'll take mine now.

GEORGE

No, but you... you... you're thinking

of this place all wrong. As if I had

the money back in a safe. The money's

not here. Your money's in Joe's

house...

(to one of the men)

...right next to yours. And in the

Kennedy house, and Mrs. Macklin's

house, and a hundred others. Why,

you're lending them the money to

build, and then, they're going to

pay it back to you as best they can.

Now what are you going to do?

Foreclose on them?

TOM

I got two hundred and forty-two

dollars in here, and two hundred and

forty-two dollars isn't going to

break anybody.

GEORGE

(handing him a slip)

Okay, Tom. All right. Here you are.

You sign this. You'll get your money

in sixty days.

TOM

Sixty days?

GEORGE

Well, now that's what you agreed to

when you bought your shares.

RANDALL

Tom... Tom, did you get your money?

TOM

No.

RANDALL

Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay

fifty cents on the dollar for every

share you got.

(shows bills)

CROWD

(ad lib)

Fifty cents on the dollar!

RANDALL

Yes, cash!

TOM

(to George)

Well, what do you say?

GEORGE

Now, Tom, you have to stick to your

original agreement. Now give us sixty

days on this.

TOM

(turning to Randall)

Okay, Randall.

MRS. THOMPSON

Are you going to go to Potter's?

TOM

Better to get half than nothing.

GEORGE

Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now

listen... now listen to me. I beg of

you not to do this thing. If Potter

gets hold of this Building and Loan

there'll never be another decent

house built in this town. He's already

got charge of the bank.  He's got

the bus line. He's got the department

stores. And now he's after us.  Why?

Well, it's very simple. Because we're

cutting in on his business, that's

why.  And because he wants to keep

you living in his slums and paying

the kind of rent he decides.

GEORGE

Joe, you lived in one of his houses,

didn't you? Well, have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten what he charged

you for that broken-down shack?

(to Ed)

Here, Ed. You know, you remember

last year when things weren't going

so well, and you couldn't make your

payments. You didn't lose your house,

did you? Do you think Potter would

have let you keep it?

(turns to address the

room again)

Can't you understand what's happening

here? Don't you see what's happening?

Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying!

And why? Because we're panicky and

he's not.  That's why. He's picking

up some bargains.  Now, we can get

through this thing all right. We've

got to stick together, though. We've

got to have faith in each other.

MRS. THOMPSON

But my husband hasn't worked in over

a year, and I need money.

WOMAN

How am I going to live until the

bank opens?

MAN

I got doctor bills to pay.

MAN

I need cash.

MAN

Can't feed my kids on faith.

MARY

How much do you need?

GEORGE

Hey! I got two thousand dollars!

Here's two thousand dollars. This'll

tide us over until the bank reopen.

(to Tom)

All right, Tom, how much do you need?

TOM

(doggedly)

Two hundred and forty-two dollars!

GEORGE

(pleading)

Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you

over till the bank reopens.

TOM

I'll take two hundred and forty-two

dollars.

GEORGE

There you are.

TOM

That'll close my account.

GEORGE

Your account's still here. That's a

loan.

GEORGE

Okay. All right, Ed?

ED

I got three hundred dollars here,

George.

GEORGE

Aw, now, Ed... what'll it take till

the bank reopens? What do you need?

ED

Well, I suppose twenty dollars.

GEORGE

Twenty dollars. Now you're talking.

Fine.  Thanks, Ed.

(to Mrs. Thompson,

next in line)

All right, now, Mrs. Thompson. How

much do you want?

MRS. THOMPSON

But it's your own money, George.

GEORGE

Never mind about that. How much do

you want?

MRS. THOMPSON

I can get along with twenty, all

right.

GEORGE

(counting it out)

Twenty dollars.

MRS. THOMPSON

And I'll sign a paper.

GEORGE

You don't have to sign anything. I

know you'll pay it back when you

can. That's okay.

(to woman next in

line)

All right, Mrs. Davis.

MRS. DAVIS

Could I have seventeen-fifty?

GEORGE

Seven...

(he kisses her)

Bless your heart, Of course you can

have it. You got fifty cents?

(counting)

Seven...

WIPE TO:

UNCLE BILLY

(excitedly)

We're going to make it, George.

They'll never close us up today!

GEORGE

(counting)

Six... five... four... three... two...

one... Bingo!

GEORGE

We made it! Look...

(holds up two bills)

... look, we're still in business!

We've still got two bucks left!

GEORGE

Well, let's have some of that. Get

some glasses, Cousin Tilly.

(to Uncle Billy)

We're a couple of financial wizards.

UNCLE BILLY

Those Rockefellers!

GEORGE

Get a tray for these great big

important simoleons.

UNCLE BILLY

We'll save them for seed. A toast!

They raise their glasses.

GEORGE

A toast! A toast to Papa Dollar and

to Mama Dollar, and if you want the

old Building and Loan to stay in

business, you better have a family

real quick.

COUSIN TILLY

I wish they were rabbits.

GEORGE

I wish they were too. Okay, let's

put them in the safe and see what

happens.

COUSIN EUSTACE

(handing out cigars)

Wedding cigars!

GEORGE

(startled)

Oh-oh... wedding! Holy mackerel, I'm

married! Where's Mary? Mary...

(he runs around looking

for her)

Poor Mary. Look, I've got a train to

catch.

(looks at his watch)

Well, the train's gone. I wonder if

Ernie's still here with his taxicab?

COUSIN TILLY

(on telephone)

George, there's a call for you.

GEORGE

Look, will you get my wife on the

phone?  She's probably over at her

mother's.

COUSIN TILLY

Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.

GEORGE

I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my

wife.  Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my

wife! Here, I'll take it in here.

(picks up phone)

Mary? Hello. Listen, dear, I'm

sorry...  What? Come home? What home?

Three-twenty Sycamore? Well, what...

whose home is that? The Waldorf Hotel,

huh?

WIPE TO:

MAN

Hey, this is the company's posters,

and the company won't like this.

BERT

How would you like to get a ticket

next week? Haven't you any romance

in you?

MAN

Sure I have, but I got rid of it.

BERT

(reading poster)

Liver pills! Who wants to see liver

pills on their honeymoon? What? They

want romantic places, beautiful

places...  places George wants to

go.

ERNIE

Hey, Bert, here he comes.

BERT

Come on, we got to get this up. He's

coming.

MAN

Who?

BERT

The groom, idiot. Come on, get that

ladder.

MAN

(disgustedly)

What are they  ducks?

BERT

Get that ladder up here.

MAN

All right  all right.

BERT

Hurry up... hurry up... hurry up.

MAN

I'm hurrying.

ERNIE

Hiya... Good evening, sir.

ERNIE

Entray, monsieur, entray.

MARY

(tears in her eyes)

Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

GEORGE

(overcome)

Well, I'll be... Mary, Mary, where

did you...

GEORGE

Oh, Mary...

MARY

Remember the night we broke the

windows in this old house? This is

what I wished for.

GEORGE

Darling, you're wonderful.

FADE OUT

SCHULTZ

Martini, you rented a new house?

MARTINI

Rent?

(to George)

You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?

GEORGE

What's that?

MARTINI

I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini.

I own my own house. No more we live

like pigs in thisa Potter's Field.

Hurry, Maria.

MARIA

Yes...

GEORGE

Come on...

(to Mary)

Bring the baby.

(to Martini)

I'll bring the kids in the car.

MARTINI

Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey.

GEORGE

All right, kids  here  get in here.

Now get right up on the seat there.

Get the...  get the goat!

MARTINI

Goodbye, everybody!

GEORGE

All in...

WIPE TO:

WIPE TO:

GEORGE

Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

The Martinis cross themselves.

SAM

That old George... he's always making

a speech.

(to George)

Hee-haw!

(wiggles his hands)

GEORGE

(to Mary)

Sam Wainwright!

MARY

Oh, who cares.

(to Mrs. Martini,

giving her loaf of

bread)

Bread! That this house may never

know hunger.

MARY

(giving her salt)

Salt! That life may always have

flavor.

GEORGE

(handing bottle to

Martini)

And wine!  That joy and prosperity

may reign forever. Enter the Martini

castle!

REINEMAN

Look, Mr. Potter, it's no skin off

my nose. I'm just your little rent

collector.  But you can't laugh off

this Bailey Park any more. Look at

it.

SECRETARY'S VOICE

Congressman Blatz is here to see

you.

POTTER

(to dictaphone)

Oh, tell the congressman to wait.

(to Reineman)

Go on.

REINEMAN

Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses

stuck here and there.

(indicating map)

There's the old cemetery, squirrels,

buttercups, daisies. Used to hunt

rabbits there myself. Look at it

today. Dozens of the prettiest little

homes you ever saw.  Ninety per cent

owned by suckers who used to pay

rent to you. Your Potter's Field, my

dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just

that. And are the local yokels making

with those David and Goliath

wisecracks!

POTTER

Oh, they are, are they? Even though

they know the Baileys haven't made a

dime out of it.

REINEMAN

You know very well why. The Baileys

were all chumps. Every one of these

homes is worth twice what it cost

the Building and Loan to build. If I

were you, Mr. Potter...

POTTER

(interrupting)

Well, you are not me.

REINEMAN

(as he leaves)

As I say, it's no skin off my nose.

But one of these days this bright

young man is going to be asking George

Bailey for a job.

POTTER

The Bailey family has been a boil on

my neck long enough.

SECRETARY'S VOICE

Yes, sir?

POTTER

Come in here.

SAM

We just stopped in town to take a

look at the new factory, and then

we're going to drive on down to

Florida.

GEORGE

Oh...

JANE

Why don't you have your friends join

us?

SAM

Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids

drive down with us, huh?

GEORGE

Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away,

Sam.

SAM

Still got the nose to the old

grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to

let George in on the ground floor in

plastics, and he turned me down cold.

GEORGE

Oh, now, don't rub it in.

SAM

I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess

we better run along.

JANE

Awfully glad to have met you, Mary.

MARY

Nice meeting you.

GEORGE

Goodbye.

JANE

Goodbye, George.

SAM

So long, George. See you in the funny

papers.

GEORGE

Goodbye, Sam.

MARY

Have fun.

GEORGE

Thanks for dropping around.

SAM

(to chauffeur)

To Florida!

(to George)

Hee-haw!

GEORGE

Hee-haw.

WIPE TO:

GEORGE

Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr.

Potter.

POTTER

You like it? I'll send you a box.

GEORGE

(nervously)

Well, I... I suppose I'll find out

sooner or later, but just what exactly

did you want to see me about?

POTTER

(laughs)

George, now that's just what I like

so much about you.

(pleasantly and

smoothly)

George, I'm an old man, and most

people hate me. But I don't like

them either, so that makes it all

even. You know just as well as I do

that I run practically everything in

this town but the Bailey Building

and Loan. You know, also, that for a

number of years I've been trying to

get control of it... or kill it. But

I haven't been able to do it. You

have been stopping me. In fact, you

have beaten me, George, and as anyone

in this county can tell you, that

takes some doing. Take during the

depression, for instance. You and I

were the only ones that kept our

heads. You saved the Building and

Loan, and I saved all the rest.

GEORGE

Yes. Well, most people say you stole

all the rest.

POTTER

The envious ones say that, George,

the suckers. Now, I have stated my

side very frankly. Now, let's look

at your side.  Young man, twenty-

seven, twenty-eight...  married,

making, say... forty a week.

GEORGE

(indignantly)

Forty-five!

POTTER

Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which,

after supporting your mother, and

paying your bills, you're able to

keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child

or two comes along, and you won't

even be able to save the ten. Now,

if this young man of twenty-eight

was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd

say he was doing fine. But George

Bailey is not a common, ordinary

yokel. He's an intelligent, smart,

ambitious young man  who hates his

job  who hates the Building and

Loan almost as much as I do. A young

man who's been dying to get out on

his own ever since he was born. A

young man... the smartest one of the

crowd, mind you, a young man who has

to sit by and watch his friends go

places, because he's trapped.  Yes,

sir, trapped into frittering his

life away playing nursemaid to a lot

of garlic-eaters.  Do I paint a

correct picture, or do I exaggerate?

GEORGE

(mystified)

Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?

POTTER

My point? My point is, I want to

hire you.

GEORGE

(dumbfounded)

Hire me?

POTTER

I want you to manage my affairs, run

my properties. George, I'll start

you out at twenty thousand dollars a

year.

GEORGE

(flabbergasted)

Twenty thou... twenty thousand dollars

a year?

POTTER

You wouldn't mind living in the nicest

house in town, buying your wife a

lot of fine clothes, a couple of

business trips to New York a year,

maybe once in a while Europe. You

wouldn't mind that, would you, George?

GEORGE

Would I?

(looking around

skeptically)

You're not talking to somebody else

around here, are you? You know, this

is me, you remember me? George Bailey.

POTTER

Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship

has just come in  providing he has

brains enough to climb aboard.

GEORGE

Well, what about the Building and

Loan?

POTTER

Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid

of success? I'm offering you a three

year contract at twenty thousand

dollars a year, starting today. Is

it a deal or isn't it?

GEORGE

Well, Mr. Potter, I... I... I know I

ought to jump at the chance, but

I... I just...  I wonder if it would

be possible for you to give me twenty-

four hours to think it over?

POTTER

Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and

talk about it to your wife.

GEORGE

I'd like to do that.

POTTER

In the meantime, I'll draw up the

papers.

GEORGE

All right, sir.

POTTER

(offers hand)

Okay, George?

GEORGE

(taking his hand)

Okay, Mr. Potter.

GEORGE

(vehemently)

No... no... no... no, now wait a

minute, here!  I don't have to talk

to anybody!  I know right now, and

the answer is no! NO!  Doggone it!

(getting madder all

the time)

You sit around here and you spin

your little webs and you think the

whole world revolves around you and

your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr.

Potter!  In the... in the whole vast

configuration of things, I'd say you

were nothing but a scurvy little

spider. You...

GEORGE

...And that goes for you too!

GEORGE

And it goes for you too!

WIPE TO:

POTTER'S VOICE

You wouldn't mind living in the nicest

house in town. Buying your wife a

lot of fine clothes, going to New

York on a business trip a couple of

times a year.  Maybe to Europe once

in a while.

GEORGE'S VOICE

I know what I'm going to do tomorrow

and the next day and next year and

the year after that. I'm shaking the

dust of this crummy little town off

my feet, and I'm going to see the

world... And I'm going to build

things. I'm going to build air fields.

I'm going to build skyscrapers a

hundred stories high. I'm going to

build a bridge a mile long.

GEORGE'S VOICE

What is it you want, Mary? You want

the moon? If you do, just say the

word; I'll throw a lasso around it

and pull it down for you.

MARY

(singing)

Buffalo Gals, won't you come out

tonight, won't you come out tonight,

won't you come out tonight.

GEORGE

Hi.

MARY

Hi.

GEORGE

Mary Hatch, why in the world did you

ever marry a guy like me?

MARY

To keep from being an old maid.

GEORGE

You could have married Sam Wainwright

or anybody else in town.

MARY

I didn't want to marry anybody else

in town. I want my baby to look like

you.

GEORGE

You didn't even have a honeymoon. I

promised you...

(does a double take)

...Your what?

MARY

My baby.

GEORGE

(incredulously)

You mean... Mary, you on the nest?

MARY

George Bailey lassos stork.

GEORGE

Lassos the stork! You mean you...

What is it, a boy or a girl?

FADE OUT

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Now, you've probably already guessed

that George never leaves Bedford

Falls.

CLARENCE'S VOICE

No!

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Mary had her baby, a boy.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Then she had another one  a girl.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Day after day she worked away remaking

the old Granville house into a home.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Night after night George came back

late from the office. Potter was

bearing down hard.

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Ernie, the taxi driver, parachuted

CLARENCE'S VOICE

Yes, but George...

JOSEPH'S VOICE

Hi, Ernie, look at that.

ERNIE

ERNIE

I know  I know  I know. I think

it's marvelous.

Now look, this is for you. This is

Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

COUSIN EUSTACE

George! George! It's Harry now on

long distance from Washington!

GEORGE

Harry! What do you know about that?

COUSIN EUSTACE

He reversed the charges. It's okay,

isn't it?

GEORGE

What do you mean it's okay?  For a

hero?

(takes the phone)

Harry!  Oh, you old seven kinds of a

son of a gun. Congratulations!  How's

Mother standing it?... She did? What

do you know...

(to Eustace)

Mother had lunch with the President's

wife!

COUSIN TILLY

Wait till Martha hears about this.

COUSIN EUSTACE

What did they have to eat?

GEORGE

(on phone)

What did they have to eat? Harry,

you should see what they're cooking

up in the town for you... Oh, are

they?

(to Eustace)

The Navy's going to fly Mother home

this afternoon.

COUSIN EUSTACE

In a plane?

GEORGE

What? Uncle Billy?

(to Eustace)

Has Uncle Billy come in yet?

COUSIN TILLY

No, he stopped at the bank first.

He's not here right now, Harry.

I'll be right back.

GEORGE

Good morning, sir.

CARTER

Carter  bank examiner.

GEORGE

Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.

CARTER

Merry Christmas.

GEORGE

We're all excited around here.

(shows him paper)

My brother just got the Congressional

Medal of Honor. The President just

decorated him.

CARTER

Well, I guess they do those things.

Well, I trust you had a good year.

GEORGE

Good year? Well, between you and me,

Mr. Carter, we're broke.

CARTER

Yeah, very funny.

GEORGE

Well...

(leading him into

office)

...now, come right in here, Mr.

Carter.

CARTER

Although I shouldn't wonder when you

okay reverse charges on personal

long distance calls.

COUSIN TILLY

George, shall we hang up?

GEORGE

No, no. He wants to talk to Uncle

Billy.  You just hold on.

CARTER

(in doorway)

Now, if you'll cooperate, I'd like

to finish with you by tonight. I

want to spend Christmas in Elmira

with my family.

GEORGE

I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter,

Just step right in here. We'll fix

you up.

UNCLE BILLY

December twenty-fourth...

UNCLE BILLY

Eight thousand...

UNCLE BILLY

Well, good morning, Mr. Potter. What's

the news?

UNCLE BILLY(CONT'D)

Well, well, well, Harry Bailey wins

Congressional Medal. That couldn't

be one of the Bailey boys? You just

can't keep those Baileys down, now,

can you, Mr. Potter?

POTTER

How does slacker George feel about

that?

UNCLE BILLY

Very jealous, very jealous. He only

lost three buttons off his vest. Of

course, slacker George would have

gotten two of those medals if he had

gone.

POTTER

Bad ear.

UNCLE BILLY

Yes.

UNCLE BILLY

After all, Potter, some people like

George had to stay home. Not every

heel was in Germany and Japan!

CLOSE SHOT

Uncle Billy and bank teller at the

window.

UNCLE BILLY

(still chuckling)

Good morning, Horace.

TELLER

I guess you forgot something.

UNCLE BILLY

Huh?

TELLER

You forgot something.

UNCLE BILLY

What?

TELLER

Well, aren't you going to make a

deposit?

UNCLE BILLY

Sure, sure I am.

TELLER

Well, then... it's usually customary

to bring the money with you.

UNCLE BILLY

Oh, shucks...

UNCLE BILLY

(looks bewildered)

I know I had...

TELLER

How about that one there?

UNCLE BILLY

Hmm? Well, I...

POTTER

Bailey...

POTTER

Take me back there. Hurry up.

(as they go)

Come on, look sharp.

POTTER

(to goon)

Take me back.

GEORGE

Just make yourself at home, Mr.

Carter.  I'll get those books for

you.

GEORGE

Oh, hello, Vi.

VIOLET

George, can I see you for a second?

GEORGE

Why, of course you can. Come on in

the office here.

GEORGE

Uncle Billy, talk to Harry. He's on

the telephone.

COUSIN TILLY

Hurry, Uncle Billy, hurry. Long

distance, Washington.

COUSIN EUSTACE

Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

COUSIN TILLY

Harry, your nephew, remember?

COUSIN EUSTACE

(on phone)

Here he is.

UNCLE BILLY

(on phone)

Hello... hello... Yes, Harry  yes...

everything... everything's fine.

UNCLE BILLY

I should have my head examined. Eight

thousand dollars. It's got to be

somewhere.

GEORGE

(hands it to her)

Here you are.

VIOLET

(bitterly)

Character? If I had any character,

I'd...

GEORGE

It takes a lot of character to leave

your home town and start all over

again.  He pulls some money from his

pocket, and offers it to her.

VIOLET

No, George, don't...

GEORGE

Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?

VIOLET

I know, but...

GEORGE

What do you want to do, hock your

furs, and that hat? Want to walk to

New York?  You know, they charge for

meals and rent up there just the

same as they do in Bedford Falls.

VIOLET

(taking money)

Yeah  sure...

GEORGE

It's a loan. That's my business.

Building and Loan. Besides, you'll

get a job. Good luck to you.

VIOLET

I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

GEORGE

Say hello to New York for me.

VIOLET

Yeah  yeah... sure I will.

GEORGE

Now, let's hear from you...

GEORGE

What's the matter? Merry Christmas,

Vi.

VIOLET

Merry Christmas, George.

MR. CARTER

Mr. Bailey...

GEORGE

Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry. I'll be

right with you.

(to Cousin Tilly)

Uncle Billy in?

COUSIN TILLY

Yeah, he's in his office.

GEORGE

Unc... What's going on? The bank

examiner's here, and I...

UNCLE BILLY

(in dismay)

He's here?

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah. He wants the accounts

payable...

GEORGE

What's the matter with you?

GEORGE

Eustace...

EUSTACE

Yeah?

GEORGE

Come here a minute.

GEORGE

Did you see Uncle Billy with any

cash last night?

COUSIN EUSTACE

He had it on his desk counting it

before he closed up.

GEORGE

Now look, did you buy anything?

UNCLE BILLY

Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.

GEORGE

All right. All right. Now we'll go

over every step you took since you

left the house.

UNCLE BILLY

This way.

WIPE TO:

GEORGE

And did you put the envelope in your

pocket?

UNCLE BILLY

Yeah... yeah... maybe... maybe...

GEORGE

(shouts)

Maybe  maybe! I don't want any maybe.

Uncle Billy, we've got to find that

money!

UNCLE BILLY

(piteously)

I'm no good to you, George. I...

GEORGE

Listen to me. Do you have any secret

hiding place here in the house?

Someplace you could have put it?

Someplace to hide the money?

UNCLE BILLY

(exhausted)

I've been over the whole house, even

in rooms that have been locked ever

since I lost Laura.

GEORGE

(harshly)

Listen to me! Listen to me! Think!

Think!

UNCLE BILLY

(sobbing)

I can't think any more, George. I

can't think any more. It hurts...

GEORGE

(screaming at him)

Where's that money, you stupid, silly

old fool? Where's the money?  Do you

realize what this means? It means

bankruptcy and scandal, and prison!

GEORGE

That's what it means! One of us is

going to jail! Well, it's not going

to be me!

WIPE TO:

MARY

Hello darling.

CHILDREN

Hello Daddy, hello daddy.

MARY

(indicating tree)

How do you like it?

MARY AND CHILDREN

Bless you!

MARY

Did you bring the wreath?

PETE

Did you bring the Christmas wreath?

GEORGE

What? What wreath?

MARY

The Merry Christmas wreath for the

window.

GEORGE

(gruffly)

No. I left it at the office.

MARY

Is it snowing?

GEORGE

Yeah, just started.

MARY

Where's your coat and hat?

GEORGE

Left them at the office.

MARY

What's the matter?

GEORGE

(bitterly)

Nothing's the matter. Everything's

all right.

MARY

Go on, Pete, you're a big boy.  You

can put the star up. Way up at the

top. That's it.  Fill in that little

bare spot right there.  That's it.

(to George)

Isn't it wonderful about Harry?

We're famous, George. I'll bet I had

fifty calls today about the parade,

the banquet. Your mother's so excited,

she...

GEORGE

Must she keep playing that?

JANIE

(hurt)

I have to practice for the party

tonight, Daddy.

PETE

Mommy says we can stay up till

midnight and sing Christmas carols.

TOMMY

Can you sing, Daddy?

MARY

(to George)

Better hurry and shave. The families

will be here soon.

GEORGE

(rising from chair)

Families!  I don't want the families

over here!

MARY

Come on out in the kitchen with me

while I finish dinner.

TOMMY

Excuse me... excuse me...

MARY

Have a hectic day?

GEORGE

(bitterly)

Oh, yeah, another big red letter day

for the Baileys.

PETE

Daddy, the Browns next door have a

new car. You should see it.

GEORGE

(turns on him)

Well, what's the matter with our

car?  Isn't it good enough for you?

PETE

Yes, Daddy.

TOMMY

(tugging at coat)

Excuse me, excuse me...

GEORGE

(annoyed)

Excuse you for what?

TOMMY

I burped!

MARY

All right, darling, you're excused.

Now go upstairs and see what little

Zuzu wants.

GEORGE

Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?

MARY

Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed.

Caught it coming home from school.

They gave her a flower for a prize

and she didn't want to crush it so

she didn't button up her coat.

GEORGE

What is it, a sore throat or what?

MARY

Just a cold. The doctor says it's

nothing serious.

GEORGE

The doctor? Was the doctor here?

MARY

Yes, I called him right away. He

says it's nothing to worry about.

GEORGE

Is she running a temperature? What

is it?

MARY

Just a teensie one  ninety-nine,

six.  She'll be all right.

GEORGE

Gosh, it's this old house. I don't

know why we don't all have pneumonia.

This drafty old barn! Might as well

be living in a refrigerator. Why did

we have to live here in the first

place and stay around this measly,

crummy old town?

MARY

(worried)

George, what's wrong?

GEORGE

Wrong? Everything's wrong! You call

this a happy family? Why did we have

to have all these kids?

PETE

(coming in)

Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?

GEORGE

(shouts)

I don't know. Ask your mother.

MARY

Where're you going?

GEORGE

Going up to see Zuzu.

PETE

He told me to write a play for

tonight.

MARY

F-R-A-N-K-I-N...

ZUZU

Hi, Daddy.

GEORGE

Well, what happened to you?

ZUZU

I won a flower.

GEORGE

Wait now. Where do you think you're

going?

ZUZU

Want to give my flower a drink.

GEORGE

All right, all right. Here, give

Daddy the flower. I'll give it a

drink.

ZUZU

Look, Daddy... paste it.

GEORGE

Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste

this together.

GEORGE

There it is, good as new.

ZUZU

Give the flower a drink.

GEORGE

Now, will you do something for me?

ZUZU

What?

GEORGE

Will you try to get some sleep?

ZUZU

I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my

flower.

GEORGE

I know  I know, but you just go to

sleep, and then you can dream about

it, and it'll be a whole garden.

ZUZU

It will?

GEORGE

Uh-huh.

JANIE AND PETE

Telephone.

MARY

I'll get it.

(on phone)

Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

MARY

Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. I'm sure

she'll be all right. The doctor says

that she ought to be out of bed in

time to have her Christmas dinner.

GEORGE

Is that Zuzu's teacher?

MARY

(hand over receiver)

Yes.

GEORGE

Let me speak to her.

GEORGE

(on phone)

Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?  This is

George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.

Say, what kind of a teacher are you

anyway?  What do you mean sending

her home like that, halfnaked?  Do

you realize she'll probably end up

with pneumonia on account of you?

MARY

(shocked)

George!

GEORGE

Is this the sort of thing we pay

taxes for  to have teachers like

you? Silly, stupid, careless people

who send our kids home without any

clothes on? You know, maybe my kids

aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe

they don't have any decent clothes...

GEORGE

Aw, that stupid...

MARY

Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to

apologize...  hello... hello...

(to George)

She's hung up.

GEORGE

(savagely)

I'll hang her up!

MR. WELCH'S VOICE

Now, who do you think you are?

GEORGE

(to Mary)

Wait a minute.

(on phone)

Hello? Who is this? Oh, Mr. Welch?

Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch. Gives

me a chance to tell you what I really

think of your wife.

MARY

George...

GEORGE

(raving at her)

Will you get out and let me handle

this?

(into phone  shouting)

Hello? Hello? What? Oh, you will,

huh?  Okay, Mr. Welch, any time you

think you're man enough... Hello?

Any...

GEORGE

Oh...

PETE

Daddy, how do you spell "Hallelujah"?

GEORGE

(shouts)

How should I know? What do you think

I am, a dictionary?

GEORGE

Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

GEORGE

(savagely)

Janie, haven't you learned that silly

tune yet? You've played it over and

over again.  Now stop it! Stop it!

GEORGE

(gasping for breath)

I'm sorry, Mary, Janie. I'm sorry. I

didn't mean... you go on and practice.

Pete, I owe you an apology, too. I'm

sorry. What do you want to know?

PETE

(holding back his

tears)

Nothing, Daddy.

GEORGE

What's the matter with everybody?

Janie, go on. I told you to practice.

(shouts)

Now, go on, play!

JANIE

Oh, Daddy...

MARY

(in an outburst)

George, why must you torture the

children?  Why don't you...

GEORGE

Mary...

MARY

Bedford, two-four-seven, please.

PETE

Is Daddy in trouble?

JANIE

Shall I pray for him?

MARY

Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

TOMMY

Me, too?

MARY

You too, Tommy.

(on phone)

Hello, Uncle Billy?

WIPE TO:

GEORGE

I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need

help.  Through some sort of an

accident my company's short in their

accounts. The bank examiner's up

there today. I've got to raise eight

thousand dollars immediately.

POTTER

(casually)

Oh, so that's what the reporters

wanted to talk to you about?

GEORGE

(incredulous)

The reporters?

POTTER

Yes. They called me up from your

Building and Loan. Oh, there's a man

over there from the D.A.'s office,

too. He's looking for you.

GEORGE

(desperate)

Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me,

won't you please? Can't you see what

it means to my family? I'll pay you

any sort of a bonus on the loan...

any interest. If you still want the

Building and Loan, why I...

POTTER

(interrupting)

George, could it possibly be there's

a slight discrepancy in the books?

GEORGE

No, sir. There's nothing wrong with

the books. I've just misplaced eight

thousand dollars. I can't find it

anywhere.

POTTER

(looking up)

You misplaced eight thousand dollars?

GEORGE

Yes, sir.

POTTER

Have you notified the police?

GEORGE

No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.

Harry's homecoming tomorrow...

POTTER

(snorts)

They're going to believe that one.

What've you been doing, George?

Playing the market with the company's

money?

GEORGE

No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.

POTTER

What is it  a woman, then? You know,

it's all over town that you've been

giving money to Violet Bick.

GEORGE

(incredulous)

What?

POTTER

Not that it makes any difference to

me, but why did you come to me? Why

don't you go to Sam Wainwright and

ask him for the money?

GEORGE

I can't get hold of him. He's in

Europe.

POTTER

Well, what about all your other

friends?

GEORGE

They don't have that kind of money,

Mr. Potter. You know that. You're

the only one in town that can help

me.

POTTER

I see. I've suddenly become quite

important. What kind of security

would I have, George? Have you got

any stocks?

GEORGE

(shaking his head)

No, sir.

POTTER

Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of

any kind?

GEORGE

(pulls out policy)

I have some life insurance, a fifteen

thousand dollar policy.

POTTER

Yes... how much is your equity in

it?

GEORGE

Five hundred dollars.

POTTER

(sarcastically)

Look at you. You used to be so cocky!

You were going to go out and conquer

the world! You once called me a

warped, frustrated old man. What are

you but a warped, frustrated young

man? A miserable little clerk crawling

in here on your hands and knees and

begging for help. No securities  no

stocks  no bonds  nothing but a

miserable little five hundred dollar

equity in a life insurance policy.

You're worth more dead than alive.

Why don't you go to the riff-raff

you love so much and ask them to let

you have eight thousand dollar? You

know why? Because they'd run you out

of town on a rail... But I'll tell

you what I'm going to do for you,

George. Since the state examiner is

still here, as a stockholder of the

Building and Loan, I'm going to swear

out a warrant for your arrest.

Misappropriation of funds

manipulation  malfeasance...

POTTER

All right, George, go ahead. You

can't hide in a little town like

this.

POTTER

(on phone)

Bill? This is Potter.

MARTINI'S VOICE

(greeting new customers)

Merry Christmas. Glad you came.

MAN'S VOICE

How about some of that good spaghetti?

MARTINI'S VOICE

We got everything.

GEORGE

God... God... Dear Father in Heaven,

I'm not a praying man, but if you're

up there and you can hear me, show

me the way. I'm at the end of my

rope. Show me the way, God.

NICK

(friendly)

Are you all right, George? Want

someone to take you home?

MARTINI

(worried)

Why you drink so much, my friend?

Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is

Christmas Eve.

MAN

Bailey? Which Bailey?

NICK

This is Mr. George Bailey.

MAN

(to George)

And the next time you talk to my

wife like that you'll get worse. She

cried for an hour. It isn't enough

she slaves teaching your stupid kids

how to read and write, and you have

to bawl her out...

MARTINI

(furious)

You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

WELCH

Now wait... I want to pay for my

drink.

MARTINI

Never mind the money. You get out of

here quick.

WELCH

All right.

MARTINI

You hit my best friend. Get out!

NICK

You all right, George?

GEORGE

(stunned)

Who was that?

MARTINI

He's gone. Don't worry. His name is

Welch.  He don't come in to my place

no more.

GEORGE

Oh  Welch. That's what I get for

praying.

MARTINI

The last time he come in here. You

hear that, Nick?

NICK

Yes, you bet.

GEORGE

Where's my insurance policy?

(finds it in pocket)

Oh, here...

MARTINI

Oh, no, Please, don't go out this

way, Mr. Bailey.

GEORGE

I'm all right.

MARTINI

Oh, no  you don't feel so good.

GEORGE

I'm all right.

MARTINI

Please don't go away  please!

Now look what you did. My

Look where you're going!

WIPE TO:

CLARENCE

I didn't have time to get some stylish

underwear. My wife gave me this on

my last birthday. I passed away in

it.

CLARENCE

Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

You should read the new book Mark

Twain's writing now.

TOLLKEEPER

How'd you happen to fall in?

CLARENCE

I didn't fall in. I jumped in to

save George.

GEORGE

You what? To save me?

CLARENCE

Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go

through with it, did you?

GEORGE

Go through with what?

CLARENCE

Suicide.

TOLLKEEPER

It's against the law to commit suicide

around here.

CLARENCE

Yeah, it's against the law where I

come from, too.

TOLLKEEPER

Where do you come from?

CLARENCE

Heaven.

(to George)

I had to act quickly; that's why I

jumped in. I knew if I were drowning

you'd try to save me. And you see,

you did, and that's how I saved you.

GEORGE

(offhand)

Very funny.

CLARENCE

Your lip's bleeding, George.

GEORGE

Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in

answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

CLARENCE

(comes around to George)

Oh, no  no  no. I'm the answer to

your prayer. That's why I was sent

down here.

GEORGE

(casually interested)

How do you know my name?

CLARENCE

Oh, I know all about you. I've watched

you grow up from a little boy.

GEORGE

What are you, a mind reader or

something?

CLARENCE

Oh, no.

GEORGE

Well, who are you, then?

CLARENCE

Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

GEORGE

Odbody... A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?

CLARENCE

Angel, Second Class.

CLARENCE

(to tollkeeper)

Cheerio, my good man.

GEORGE

Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini

put in those drinks?

GEORGE

Hey, what's with you? What did you

say just a minute ago? Why'd you

want to save me?

CLARENCE

That's what I was sent down for. I'm

your guardian angel.

GEORGE

I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

CLARENCE

Ridiculous of you to think of killing

yourself for money. Eight thousand

dollars.

GEORGE

(bewildered)

Yeah... just things like that. Now

how'd you know that?

CLARENCE

I told you  I'm your guardian angel.

I know everything about you.

GEORGE

Well, you look about like the kind

of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen

angel, aren't you? What happened to

your wings?

CLARENCE

I haven't won my wings yet. That's

why I'm an angel Second Class.

GEORGE

I don't know whether I like it very

much being seen around with an angel

without any wings.

CLARENCE

Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll

help me, won't you?

GEORGE

(humoring him)

Sure, sure. How?

CLARENCE

By letting me help you.

GEORGE

Only one way you can help me. You

don't happen to have eight thousand

bucks on you?

CLARENCE

Oh, no, no. We don't use money in

Heaven.

GEORGE

Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting.

Comes in pretty handy down here,

bub.

CLARENCE

Oh, tut, tut, tut.

GEORGE

I found it out a little late. I'm

worth more dead than alive.

CLARENCE

Now look, you mustn't talk like that.

I won't get my wings with that

attitude. You just don't know all

that you've done. If it hadn't been

for you...

GEORGE

(interrupts)

Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,

everybody'd be a lot better off. My

wife, and my kids and my friends.

(annoyed with Clarence)

Look, little fellow, go off and haunt

somebody else, will you?

CLARENCE

No, you don't understand. I've got

my job...

GEORGE

(savagely)

Aw, shut up, will you.

CLARENCE

(to himself)

Hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy.

(to George)

So you still think killing yourself

would make everyone feel happier,

eh?

GEORGE

(dejectedly)

Oh, I don't know. I guess you're

right. I suppose it would have been

better if I'd never been born at

all.

CLARENCE

What'd you say?

GEORGE

I said I wish I'd never been born.

CLARENCE

Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

You...

(gets an idea)

...wait a minute. Wait a minute.

That's an idea.

(glances up toward

Heaven)

What do you think? Yeah, that'll do

it.  All right.

(to George)

You've got your wish. You've never

been born.

CLARENCE

(looking upward)

You don't have to make all that fuss

about it.

GEORGE

What did you say?

CLARENCE

You've never been born. You don't

exist.  You haven't a care in the

world.

CLARENCE

No worries  no obligations  no

eight thousand dollars to get  no

Potter looking for you with the

Sheriff.

GEORGE

Say something else in that ear.

CLARENCE

(bending down)

Sure. You can hear out of it.

GEORGE

Well, that's the doggonedest thing...

I haven't heard anything out of that

ear since I was a kid. Must have

been that jump in the cold water.

CLARENCE

Your lip's stopped bleeding, too,

George.

GEORGE

What do you know about that... What's

happened?

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

George looks around, as though to

get his bearings.

GEORGE

It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it?

What's happened here?

(standing up)

Come on, soon as these clothes of

ours are dry...

CLARENCE

Our clothes are dry.

GEORGE

What do you know about that? Stove's

hotter than I thought. Now, come on,

get your clothes on, and we'll stroll

up to my car and get...

GEORGE

Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.

CLARENCE

I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.

GEORGE

You haven't got your wings. Yeah,

that's right.

WIPE TO:

CLARENCE

What's the matter?

GEORGE

(puzzled)

Well, this is where I left my car

and it isn't here.

CLARENCE

You have no car.

GEORGE

Well, I had a car, and it was right

here.  I guess somebody moved it.

OWNER

(politely)

Good evening.

GEORGE

Oh, say... Hey... where's my car?

OWNER

I beg your pardon?

GEORGE

My car, my car. I'm the fellow that

owns the car that ran into your tree.

OWNER

What tree?

GEORGE

What do you mean, what tree? This

tree.  Here, I ran into it. Cut a

big gash in the side of it here.

OWNER

You must mean two other trees. You

had me worried. One of the oldest

trees in Pottersville.

GEORGE

(blankly)

Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford

Falls.

OWNER

I mean Pottersville.

(sharply)

Don't you think I know where I live?

What's the matter with you?

GEORGE

Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my

nut, or he is...

(to Clarence)

...or you are!

CLARENCE

It isn't me!

GEORGE

Well, maybe I left the car up at

Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.

CLARENCE

(as they go)

Clarence!

GEORGE

Clarence! Clarence!

WIPE TO:

GEORGE

(as they come in)

That's all right. Go on in. Martini's

a good friend of mine.

GEORGE

There's a place to sit down. Sit

down.

MEDIUM CLOSEUP

Nick is wiping off the bar as they

sit down.

GEORGE

Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?

NICK

You want a martini?

GEORGE

No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is

he?

NICK

(impatient)

Look, I'm the boss. You want a drink

or don't you?

GEORGE

Okay  all right. Double bourbon,

quick, huh?

NICK

Okay.

(to Clarence)

What's yours?

CLARENCE

I was just thinking...

(face puckers up with

delicious anticipation)

It's been so long since I...

NICK

(impatient)

Look, mister, I'm standing here

waiting for you to make up your mind.

CLARENCE

(appreciatively)

That's a good man. I was just thinking

of a flaming rum punch. No, it's not

cold enough for that. Not nearly

cold enough...  Wait a minute...

wait a minute... I got it. Mulled

wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light

on the cloves. Off with you, me lad,

and be lively!

NICK

Hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks

in here for men who want to get drunk

fast.  And we don't need any

characters around to give the joint

atmosphere. Is that clear?  Or do I

have to slip you my left for a

convincer?

CLARENCE

(to George)

What's he talking about?

GEORGE

(soothingly)

Nick  Nick, just give him the same

as mine. He's okay.

NICK

Okay.

GEORGE

What's the matter with him. I never

saw Nick act like that before.

CLARENCE

You'll see a lot of strange things

from now on.

GEORGE

Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you

worry me. You got someplace to sleep?

CLARENCE

No.

GEORGE

You don't huh? Well, you got any

money?

CLARENCE

No.

GEORGE

No wonder you jumped in the river.

CLARENCE

I jumped in the river to save you so

I could get my wings.

GEORGE

Oh, that's right.

CLARENCE

Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.

GEORGE

Made what?

CLARENCE

Every time you hear a bell ring, it

means that some angel's just got his

wings.

GEORGE

Look, I think maybe you better not

mention getting your wings around

here.

CLARENCE

Why? Don't they believe in angels?

GEORGE

(looking at Nick)

A... Yeah, but... you know...

CLARENCE

Then why should they be surprised

when they see one?

GEORGE

(to Nick)

He never grew up. He's...

(to Clarence)

How old are you, anyway, Clarence?

CLARENCE

Two hundred and ninety-three...

(thinks)

...next May.

NICK

That does it! Out you two pixies go,

through the door or out the window!

GEORGE

Look, Nick. What's wrong?

NICK

(angrily)

And that's another thing. Where do

you come off calling me Nick?

GEORGE

Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't

it?

NICK

What's that got to do with it? I

don't know you from Adam's off ox.

(sees someone come in)

Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come

here!

NICK

(to Gower)

Didn't I tell you never to come

panhandling around here?

GEORGE

Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George

Bailey! Don't you know me?

GOWER

No. No.

NICK

(to his bouncers)

Throw him out. Throw him out.

GEORGE

(bewildered)

Hey, what is... Hey, Nick, Nick...

Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

NICK

You know, that's another reason for

me not to like you. That rumhead

spent twenty years in jail for

poisoning a kid. If you know him,

you must be a jailbird yourself.

(to his bouncers)

Would you show these gentlemen to

the door.

BOUNCER

Sure. This way, gentlemen.

NICK

Hey! Get me! I'm giving out wings!

CLARENCE

You see, George, you were not there

to stop Gower from putting that poison

into the...

GEORGE

What do you mean, I wasn't there? I

remember distinctly...

GEORGE

(exasperated)

What the... hey, what's going on

around here?  Why, this ought to be

Martini's place.

GEORGE

Look, who are you?

CLARENCE

(patiently)

I told you, George. I'm your guardian

angel.

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.

What else are you? What... are you a

hypnotist?

CLARENCE

No, of course not.

GEORGE

Well then, why am I seeing all these

strange things?

CLARENCE

Don't you understand, George? It's

because you were not born.

GEORGE

Then if I wasn't born, who am I?

CLARENCE

You're nobody. You have no identity.

GEORGE

What do you mean, no identity? My

name's George Bailey.

CLARENCE

There is no George Bailey. You have

no papers, no cards, no driver's

license, no 4-F card, no insurance

policy...

(he says these things

as George searches

for them)

George looks in his watch pocket.

CLARENCE

They're not there, either.

GEORGE

What?

CLARENCE

Zuzu's petals.

CLARENCE

You've been given a great gift,

George. A chance to see what the

world would be like without you.

GEORGE

(shaking his head)

Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute

here. As, this is some sort of a

funny dream I'm having here. So long,

mister, I'm going home.

CLARENCE

Home? What home?

GEORGE

(furious)

Now shut up! Cut it out! You're...

you're... you're crazy! That's what

I think... you're screwy, and you're

driving me crazy, too! I'm seeing

things. I'm going home and see my

wife and family. Do you understand

that? And I'm going home alone!

CLARENCE

How'm I doing, Joseph. Thanks.

(pause)

No, I didn't have a drink!

WIPE TO:

GEORGE

Hey... hey. Where did the Building

and Loan move to?

COP

The Building and what?

GEORGE

The Bailey Building and Loan. It was

up there.

COP

They went out of business years ago.

GEORGE

Hey, Violet!

(to the cop)

Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!

COP

I know. I know.

GEORGE

I know that girl!

GEORGE

Hey, Ernie  Ernie!

GEORGE

Ernie, take me home. I'm off my nut!

ERNIE

(a much harder Ernie)

Where do you live?

GEORGE

Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't

you start pulling that stuff. You

know where I live. Three-twenty

Sycamore. Now hurry up.

ERNIE

Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore?...

GEORGE

Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

ERNIE

All right.  He pulls down the flag

on the meter and starts the cab.

GEORGE

Look here, Ernie, straighten me out

here.  I've got some bad liquor or

something.  Listen to me now. Now,

you are Ernie Bishop, and you live

in Bailey Park with your wife and

kid? That's right, isn't it?

ERNIE

(suspiciously)

You seen my wife?

GEORGE

(exasperated)

Seen your wife? I've been to your

house a hundred times.

ERNIE

Look, bud, what's the idea?  I live

in a shack in Potter's Field and my

wife ran away three years ago and

took the kid...  And I ain't never

seen you before in my life.

GEORGE

Okay. Just step on it. Just get me

home.

WIPE TO:

ERNIE

Is this the place?

GEORGE

Of course it's the place.

ERNIE

Well, this house ain't been lived in

for twenty years.

BERT

What's up, Ernie?

ERNIE

I don't know, but we better keep an

eye on this guy. He's bats.

GEORGE

Mary! Mary! Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!

Where are you?

CLARENCE

They're not here, George. You have

no children.

GEORGE

(ignoring him)

Where are you?

(then, to Clarence)

What have you done with them?

BERT

All right, put up your hands. No

fast moves. Come on out here, both

of you.

GEORGE

Bert! Thank heaven you're here!

BERT

Stand back.

GEORGE

Bert, what's happened to this house?

Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

ERNIE

(warningly)

Watch him, Bert.

BERT

Come on, come on.

GEORGE

(bewildered)

Bert  Ernie! What's the matter with

you two guys? You were here on my

wedding night. You, both of you,

stood out here on the porch and sung

to us, don't you remember?

ERNIE

(nervously)

Think I'd better be going.

BERT

Look, now why don't you be a good

kid and we'll take you in to a doctor.

Everything's going to be all right.

GEORGE

Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will

you take me over to my mother's house?

Bert, listen!

(gesturing to Clarence)

It's that fellow there  he says

he's an angel  he's tried to

hypnotize me.

BERT

I hate to do this, fella.

CLARENCE

Run... George! Run, George!

CLARENCE

Help! Joseph, help!

BERT

Oh, shut up!

CLARENCE

Help, oh Joseph, help! Joseph!

BERT

Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I had

him right here.

ERNIE

(stammering)

I need a drink.

BERT

Well, which way'd they go? Help me

find 'em.

MA BAILEY

Well?

GEORGE

Mother...

MA BAILEY

Mother? What do you want?

GEORGE

Mother, this is George. I thought

sure you'd remember me.

MA BAILEY

(coldly)

George who? If you're looking for a

room there's no vacancy.

GEORGE

Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me.

Something terrible's happened to me.

I don't know what it is. Something's

happened to everybody. Please let me

come in. Keep me here until I get

over it.

MA BAILEY

Get over what? I don't take in

strangers unless they're sent here

by somebody I know.

GEORGE

(desperate)

Well, I know everybody you know.

Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

MA BAILEY

(suspiciously)

You know him?

GEORGE

Well, sure I do.

MA BAILEY

When'd you see him last?

GEORGE

Today, over at the house.

MA BAILEY

That's a lie. He's been in the insane

asylum ever since he lost his

business.  And if you ask me, that's

where you belong.

CLARENCE

Strange, isn't it?  Each man's life

touches so many other lives, and

when he isn't around he leaves an

awful hole, doesn't he?

GEORGE

(quietly, trying to

use logic)

I've heard of things like this. You've

got me in some kind of a spell, or

something.  Well, I'm going to get

out of it. I'll get out of it. I

know how, too. I... the last man I

talked to before all this stuff

started happening to me was Martini.

CLARENCE

You know where he lives?

GEORGE

Sure I know where he lives. He lives

in Bailey Park.

WIPE TO:

CLARENCE

Are you sure this is Bailey Park?

GEORGE

Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

All I know is this should be Bailey

Park. But where are the houses?

CLARENCE

(as they go)

You weren't here to build them.

CLARENCE

Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke

through the ice and was drowned at

the age of nine.

GEORGE

That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to

war! He got the Congressional Medal

of Honor! He saved the lives of every

man on that transport.

CLARENCE

(sadly)

Every man on that transport died.

Harry wasn't there to save them

because you weren't there to save

Harry. You see, George, you really

had a wonderful life.  Don't you see

what a mistake it would be to throw

it away?

GEORGE

Clarence...

CLARENCE

Yes, George?

GEORGE

Where's Mary?

CLARENCE

Oh, well, I can't...

GEORGE

I don't know how you know these

things, but tell me  where is she?

CLARENCE

I...

GEORGE

If you know where she is, tell me

where my wife is.

CLARENCE

I'm not supposed to tell.

GEORGE

(becoming violent)

Please, Clarence, tell me where she

is.

CLARENCE

You're not going to like it, George.

GEORGE

(shouting)

Where is she?

CLARENCE

She's an old maid. She never married.

GEORGE

(choking him)

Where's Mary? Where is she?

CLARENCE

She's...

GEORGE

Where is she?

CLARENCE

(in self-defense)

She's just about to close up the

library!

CLARENCE

(to himself)

There must be some easier way for me

to get my wings.

WIPE TO:

no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love

GEORGE

Mary!

GEORGE

Mary!

GEORGE

Mary! Mary!

GEORGE

Mary, it's George! Don't you know

me?  What's happened to us?

MARY

(struggling)

I don't know you! Let me go!

GEORGE

Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to

me.  Please, Mary, help me. Where's

our kids? I need you, Mary! Help me,

Mary!

GEORGE

(shouting)

Mary...

(to men holding him)

Let me go! Mary, don't run away!

MAN

Somebody call the police!

ANOTHER MAN

Hit him with a bottle!

ANOTHER MAN

He needs a strait jacket!

MARY

(from back of room)

That man  stop him!

GEORGE

(recognizing some of

them)

Tom! Ed! Charlie! That's my wife!

GEORGE

Mary!

MAN

Oh, no you don't!

GEORGE

(screaming)

Mary!

GEORGE

Clarence! Clarence! Where are you?

BERT

Oh, it's you!

BERT

(to crowd)

Stand back!

WIPE TO:

GEORGE

Clarence! Clarence! Help me, Clarence.

Get me back. Get me back. I don't

care what happens to me. Only get me

back to my wife and kids. Help me,

Clarence, please!  Please! I want to

live again!

GEORGE

I want to live again. I want to live

again. Please, God, let me live again.

BERT

Hey, George! George! You all right?

BERT

Hey, what's the matter?

GEORGE

(warningly)

Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll

hit you again! Get out!

BERT

What the Sam Hill you yelling for,

George?

GEORGE

Don't... George?

GEORGE

Bert, do you know me?

BERT

Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been

looking all over town trying to find

you.  I saw your car piled into that

tree down there, and I thought

maybe... Hey, your mouth's bleeding;

are you sure you're all right?

GEORGE

What did...

GEORGE

(joyously)

My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's

bleed...

(feeling in watch

pocket)

Zuzu's petals! Zuzu's... they're...

they're here, Bert! What do you know

about that? Merry Christmas!

Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!

CARTER

Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit!

GEORGE

I know. Eight thousand dollars.

SHERIFF

(reaching into pocket)

George, I've got a little paper here.

GEORGE

(happily)

I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.

Isn't it wonderful? Merry Christmas!

GEORGE

Reporters? Where's Mary?

Oh, look at this wonderful old drafty

house! Mary! Mary!

Oh, George, George!

You have no idea what's happened to

me.

MARY

You have no idea what happened...

MARY

Well, come on, George, come on

downstairs quick. They're on their

way.

GEORGE

All right.

MARY

Come on in here now. Now, you stand

right over here, by the tree. Right

there, and don't move, don't move. I

hear 'em now, George, it's a miracle!

It's a miracle!

MARY

Come in, Uncle Billy! Everybody! In

here!

UNCLE BILLY

Isn't it wonderful?

UNCLE BILLY

(emotionally at the

breaking point)

Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

She told a few people you were in

trouble and they scattered all over

town collecting money.  They didn't

ask any questions  just said: "If

George is in trouble  count on me."

You never saw anything like it.

TOM

What is this, George? Another run on

the bank?

CHARLIE

Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.

ERNIE

The line forms on the right.

ERNIE

I've been saving this money for a

divorce, if ever I get a husband.

PARTRIDGE

There you are, George. I got the

Zuzu)

And here's something for you to play

with.

MAN

I wouldn't have a roof over my head

if it wasn't for you, George.

ERNIE

Just a minute. Quiet, everybody.

Quiet  quiet. Now, this is from

London.

Mr. Gower cables you need cash. Stop.

My office instructed to advance you

up to twenty-five thousand dollars.

Stop. Heehaw and Merry Christmas.

Sam Wainwright.

Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

HARRY

Hello, George, how are you?

GEORGE

Harry... Harry...

HARRY

(as he sees the money)

Mary  looks like I got here too

late.

BERT

Mary, I got him here from the airport

as quickly as I could. The fool flew

all the way up here in a blizzard.

MRS. BAILEY

Harry, how about your banquet in New

York?

HARRY

Oh, I left right in the middle of it

as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

HARRY

Good idea, Ernie. A toast... to my

big brother, George. The richest man

in town!

MARY

What's that?

GEORGE

That's a Christmas present from a

very dear friend of mine.

ZUZU

Look, Daddy. Teacher says, every

time a bell rings an angel gets his

wings.

GEORGE

(smiling)

That's right, that's right.

Attaboy, Clarence.
