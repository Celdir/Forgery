(Early Draft)

SPACE

Distant STARS, with vast tracts of darkness stretching

between them. Move in on OUR SUN, dwarfed in the immense

cosmic ocean.

MUMBLE (VO)

You ever feel small?

Moving in on....

PLANET EARTH

The spinning blue marble.

FADE IN: A strange cacophony of MUSIC, growing louder as the

familiar CONTINENTS revolve below us and we spiral down onto

ANTARCTICA

THE ICE SHELF

Vast, pristine, stupendous. Washed with dawn light. A few

small BLACK-SUITED FIGURES are moving towards us.

MUMBLE (VO)

Like you're no-one, cos the world is full

of us, and everyone's the same

Wait a minute. These aren't humans... they are PENGUINS!

MUMBLE (CONT'D)

How do you stand out from the crowd?

How do you find someone special?

A GREAT COMMUNITY

EMPEROR PENGUINS all over the place, Its chaos - Grand

central station - with everyone SINGING to each other.

MUMBLE (VO)

I know. I know. "You sing your heart

out." That's how mum found dad in the

first place

Follow a female penguin as she waddles through the massive

crowd past an assortment of crooning males

right from the moment I was born

MUMBLE

First rule of survival: get yourself laid

before winter.

MUMBLE (CONT'D)

Apparently I only just made it.

(CONTINUED)

3.

MUMBLE (CONT'D)

Afterwards Mum went off to the sea to

keep warm. Dad stayed home like dad's do,

incubating.

WISHFUL

Safe home baby....

WISHFUL (CONT'D)

I'll miss you.

MUMBLE (VO)

Tell me what it is about the cold and the

dark. Soon as the sun goes away, everyone

gets religious

LEAD VOICE

When all others leave...

CHORUS

We Remain.

LEAD VOICE

When the Sun vanishes...

CHORUS

We Remain.

(CONTINUED)

4.

CARUSO

Deny the pangs of hunger.

Seal the gaps. Share the warmth....

MUMBLE (VO)

Caruso's the leader because he's so

incredibly old. Some say more than 40,

but you know how penguins exaggerate.

CARUSO

....Each one taking his turn to defy the

wind.

CARUSO.

...As we invoke the Great One, Penguin of

Penguins

WISHFUL

(pushing back inside)

OK. Invoke. But keep moving

MUMBLE (VO)

My dad was never that devout. Often his

mind was on other stuff.

"I wanna be loved by you, alone and

nobody else by you boo boo pee doo"

things.

Listen friend, this is my Sacred

Talisman, bestowed upon me by the Mystic

Beings...

MUMBLE

Looks like they bestowed it very tight.

LOVEDAY

Enlightenment to the Forbidden Shore!

MUMBLE

So these Mystic Beings, did you see them?

LOVEDAY

I hear them. They talk to me all the time

I am their instrument. They chose me

to......

MUMBLE

Did they have frontways eyes? No

feathers? Fat flabby faces? Did they

probe you and stick a pointy thing into

you?

LOVEDAY

Enough! How many questions is that? You

don't have enough pebbles.

ADELIES IN QUEUE

...Yeah, one pebble, one question.

...We've all got stuff to ask, pal!

MUMBLE

But I haven't had any answers yet!

LOVEDAY

SILENCIO!! The Mystic Beings are

speaking. They say show some respect

stranger. Especially to the One who

Knows.

LOVEDAY (CONT'D)

The reason there are not enough fish is

simple: There is not enough love in the

world. Love is the answer!

LOVEDAY (CONT'D)

(over this)

Okay, everybody, turn around to the

penguin next to you and give them a great

big hug. Comeon, everybody...hug! This is a

safe place.

LOVEDAY (CONT'D)

MUMBLE

But I'll show you something better

MUMBLE (CONT'D)

Sing something to this!

ELLA

ABOMINATION?!!

MUMBLE

CARUSO

Happy WHAT?! This is an OUTRAGE!

(CONTINUED)

50.

CARUSO.

It is exactly this kind of disrespectful,

heretic behaviour that has brought the

Scarcity upon us! Don't you see...we are

being brought to account by the

Forefathers!

THE ELDERS

... The kid was never quite the full

Penguin.

... It all began the year he hatched.

... That's right! He's the one who brought

the blight!

MUMBLE

(astonished)

Wait. Wait. You think it's my fault that

there are no fish?!! Doing Happy Feet

can't cause a food shortage.

AN ELDER

...then what did?!

MUMBLE

My own opinion? I think living beyond

the ice there are creatures we've never

met before Aliens. Mystic Beings. Big,

flabby......

ELDERS

(pushing in)

...He has abandoned the faith.

...He has driven the fish away.

THE ADELIES

dark side

MUMBLE

No. Dad. No. What have they done to you.

You're talking like Caruso.

WISHFUL

Just do it. Pray to the Forefathers for

forgiveness.

MUMBLE

No. You're nuts. All of you. I'm outa

ELLA

Wait! Mumble!

MUMBLE

Its no use Ella. I can't live with that.

ELLA

Can you live without it?

(CONTINUED)

52.

ELLA (CONT'D)

I believe in you, Mumble. But without the

huddle we can't make an egg. Without the

egg, what are we here for?

ADELIES

...True

...That's a big question

MUMBLE

Guys. Can Me and Ella be alone for a bit

MUMBLE (CONT'D)

OK. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm

going to talk an alien. I'm going to find

what's causing the shortage

ELLA

But what about?...

MUMBLE

Its the only way. You're right. Unless

we have food theres no future for any of

us - you, me the adelies, anyone

ELLA

But...

MUMBLE

Give me a year, just until the next great

gathering. If I don't make it back ....at

ADELIES

MUMBLE

They didn't bestow it on you?

THE ADELIES

...Poor Guy.

MUMBLE

If it wasn't bestowed, what happened?

THE ADELIES

...Oh, this one's easy.

But this thing was made by someone. And

if we find them, they could take it off.

MUMBLE (CONT'D)

So where do we Go, Loveday

AN ADELIE

Oh my! Now he thinks he's an Elephant

Seal

AN ADELIE (CONT'D)

He wants to go to the top of the

MUMBLE

Could they be taking our fish?

ELEPHANT SEAL 1

Could be!? I heard they'd take a whole

penguin, rip its skin right off and turn

it into mush.

ELEPHANT SEAL 2

Huh! That's a Picnic! I hear tell they'd

take a baby seal and club it to death.

With their bare clubs.

ELEPHANT SEAL 1

Huh! Clubbing's a Clambake! My Granpappy

says they been known to skin a seal from

snout to tail in a hot second.

ELEPHANT SEAL 2

Your Granpappy don't know squat! What I

DELEGATE#2

So we all step up policing of the pirate

factory ships. And we pressure that

country to stop their so-called

`experimental' fishing.

DELEGATE#3

Yes, if our government asks your

government to approach their government

to call off their fleet...

DELEGATE#2

Better if their government hear it from

our government via your government...

CHAIRMAN

What the heck. The amount of publicity

this is generating, they'd have world war

three if they didn't stop.

MUMBLE (V.O.)

Ella's gave up teaching to look after our

chick. We take turns looking after her

and going to get the fish.

(CONTINUED)

84.

MUMBLE (V.O.)

I worry about her, sure. Theres so much

big stuff out there it can be kind of

frightening.

MUMBLE (V.O)

But the way I see it. Theres so much out

there we don't understand...,

....the stuff you think is small stuff

could actually be the big stuff.

MUMBLE (V.0

Or am I not making sense here?

VOICE#1

Is there a problem? I thought this one

was barren.

VOICE#2

More or less. But one of the stars we're

harvesting supports these things here.

(CONTINUED)

85.

VOICE#1

So...?

VOICE#2

Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know

about before was these things here

VOICE#2 (CONT'D)

Just thought you'd want to see them

before...you know.

VOICE#1

Hmm.   Charming

VOICE#2

So.    We go ahead. Or...?

VOICE#1

No. Better leave them be. See what

sector twelves got to offer instead.
