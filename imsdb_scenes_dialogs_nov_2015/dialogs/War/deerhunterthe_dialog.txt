minute)

I want to be ready... You have to

be ready... It has to be there, in

your mind.

NICK

The shot?

MERLE

Fucking A.

NICK

I don't think about the shot that

much.

MERLE

(firmly)

You have to think about the shot.

It's the shot. The shot's it.

NICK

(uncertain)

Yeah... I guess.

MERLE

(studies him)

What do you think about?

NICK

I don't know... I guess I think

about the deer... Being out, maybe.

I don't know. I think about it all.

Hell, I like the trees, you know? I

like the ways the trees are, all

the different ways the trees are

too.

MERLE

(with a glance to the

window)

I'll tell you something, Nick. I

wouldn't hunt with anyone but you.

I won't hunt with a yo-yo.

NICK

(laughs)

Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?

MERLE

Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you

think's a yo-yo! They're all yo

yo's. I mean they're all great

guys, for Christ's sake, but... The

point is, Nick, without you I'd

hunt alone. Seriously. I would.

That's what I'd do.

NICK

(laughs)

You're a fucking nut. You know

that, Merle? You're a fucking

maniac!

MERLE

Yeah.

(he grins)

When it comes to hunting, that's

true.

NICK

Albert! For Christ's sake... John!

Wait a minute, you guys!

ALBERT

It won't open.

NICK

You gotta hit it here. Here,

Albert, not there.

ALBERT

Where should I hit it? Just show me

where I should hit it.

NICK

Here. Hit it here.

ALBERT

Hey, that's neat.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

That's new, isn't it?

NICK

Oh... You know...

LINDA

I was just wondering... Nick...

You're going hunting... If I could

use this place to stay, because...

NICK

Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.

LINDA

I'd want to pay you... and I was

thinking --

NICK

(kneels in front of her)

Linda... Hey, Linda...

LINDA

I would want to pay you, Nick...

and I was thinking --

NICK

Linda, Linda...!

LINDA

NICK

Will you marry me?

LINDA

(after a long, long

moment)

Okay.

MERLE

What are you, hoping?

NICK

What else?

MERLE

I thought you might be praying.

NICK

I'm doing that too.

MERLE

I suppose you wish you were

somewhere else?

NICK

What do you think?

MERLE

Nick, you're wasting your time...

Listen to me! You're wasting your

time! This is no fucking time for

hoping or praying or wishing or any

other shit! This is it. Here we

NICK

We what?

MERLE

We gotta play with more bullets,

Nick. It's the only way.

NICK

More bullets in the gun?

MERLE

(even)

More bullets in the gun... The

trouble is that still leaves one of

us with his hands tied up, so that

means we gotta play each other.

NICK

(numb)

With more bullets?... Against each

other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you

fucking nuts!!!

MERLE

Nick... NICK!!! It's the only

chance we've got!

NICK

How many bullets?

MERLE

(watching him)

Three bullets -- minimum.

NICK

No way. No fucking way!

MERLE

his eyes)

I'll pick the moment, Nick. The

game goes on until I move. When I

start shooting, go for the nearest

guard and get his gun.

No. No way!

When you get the AK, open up. You

got me? Open up.

Only,good people love Linda, see.

What Linda has, Linda --

BAR GIRL

(in his ear)

How you like to have nice fuck with

Linda? You like that? Special,

crazy fuck just like with Linda?

NICK

(stares at her)

You mean...?

BAR GIRL

I show you. Come. You come.

(pulls him to his feet)

Linda have special, crazy fuck.

That right?

BAR GIRL (CONT'D)

I give you special, crazy fuck,

just like Linda. Come. You come.

Linda cry, make crazy moan?

BAR GIRL (CONT'D)

I give you cry, crazy moan. Come.

You come.

BAR GIRL

You like to call me Linda now?

NICK

Linda, yeah.

BAR GIRL

You call me Linda, just like home.

NICK

Hey... Hey, elephants! Look at

those elephants!

NICK (CONT'D)

Linda loves elephants! Linda... she

loves 'em!

BAR GIRL

Wait! First I give you special

fuck!

NICK

Elephants! Make way... I gotta get

elephants!

NICK

Great... These are great. I wanna

tell you these are great elephants!

I'm going home, see... Stateside in

a few days and my wife Linda, she

loves elephants. She... she has a

thing for elephants because

elephants... Elephants go on. You

know what I mean? They go right on.

I don't know if they cry. Maybe at

night. I mean... What I mean is my

two best buddies are dead, see,

MIA, who knows, and they would have

liked some elephants also

because... How much are these

elephants? I mean let's talk

elephant.

(notices a GROUP OF STREET

URCHINS)

Hey you guys...! Over here! Come

over here and carry elephants!

NICK (CONT'D)

Everyone take an elephant!

(to the YOUNGEST URCHIN)

You know how to carry an elephant?

(the URCHIN nods)

That's what I thought. Right off I

figured you as that kind of guy.

Hey, wait a minute, I gotta get

change. Take an elephant! Everyone

take an elephant and then form up.

Right here. Over here, like this,

in a nice long elephant line...

Good. That's good. Man, look at all

these elephants! One, two, three,

four, five, six, seven, eight,

nine, ten... eleven elephants!

(surveys them)

Hey, but you gotta stand tall to

carry elephants.

(he illustrates)

Better. That's better. I mean...

God damn, I mean that's elephants

now! Wait. Now you wait while I get

change.

NICK

(toneless, over and over)

Hey, hey, the wind does blow.

Hey, hey, the snow does snow.

Hey, hey, the rain does rain...

NICK (CONT'D)

Hey, hey, the wind does blow.

Hey, hey, the snow does snow...

NICK (CONT'D)

(his voice thin, cracking)

Hey, hey, the wind does blow.

Hey, hey, the snow does snow --

MAN (V.O.)

If you are brave and lucky I can

make you rich.

MAN (CONT'D)

You have played?

MAN (CONT'D)

Once you have played it is not so

hard. Cigarette?

MAN (CONT'D)

You seem... disturbed.

NICK

I... No. You do this for money?

MAN

Mais certainment... A great deal of

money. Naturally I do not do it

myself. I myself do not possess the

nerve.

(smiles)

But I am always... how do you

say... looking out for those who

do... It is a thing quite rare.

Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't

say no. When a man says no to

champagne, he says no to life and

that no man must ever do.

(gives NICK a glass)

Where did you play?

NICK

Up north.

MAN

Ah yes. Of course... So few

survive.

(smiles)

La creme de la creme... How did you

obtain release?

NICK

Playing.

MAN

(raises his eyebrows)

Playing?

NICK

We... Three bullets.

MAN

And then you...

MAN (CONT'D)

How extremely clever. That is

really most extraordinaire... Allow

me please to introduce myself. I am

Armand... And you are?

NICK

Nick.

ARMAND

Nick. C'est extraordinaire! Do you

know that I have a cousin who is

called Nicholas and a nephew

Nickolai. So you are, comme on dit,

en famille. In the family.

NICK

I have to go.

ARMAND

But you must come in.

NICK

No, I --

ARMAND

But I insist.

NICK

I have to go.

ARMAND

You are frightened, no?

ARMAND (CONT'D)

Of what is there to be afraid? The

war? The war is no problem. It is a

joke, a silly thing. I make one

call and get you out.

NICK

See, I'm going home.

ARMAND

Ah yes. Of course.

(smiles)

To the girl who waits.

NICK

(gives him a look and

sits)

Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?

ARMAND

But of course! Please make yourself

comfortable. Perhaps you would

enjoy some fresh caviar, or une

petite glace, or --?

NICK

(weary, shaking his head)

No. None of that.

ARMAND

Unfortunately I must now go in, but

I leave you my card. Naturellement

I pay my players cash American.

Just so you know.

ARMAND (V.O.) (CONT'D)

However, should you prefer German

marks, or perhaps Swiss francs,

this of course can be arranged.

Everything can be arranged.

Christ Almighty, it's fifty years!

VETS

Three cheers for the red, white and

blue...

CAB DRIVER

Whadda welcome! Will you lookit...

Whadda welcome!

NICK

That's not it.

CAB DRIVER

What're you, crazy? That's not

it??? You said a trailer. You said--

NICK

That's not it. Keep going. Go

straight.

CAB DRIVER

Hey, now listen. Now you said --

NICK

I'm telling you that's not it! Now

keep going!

NICK (CONT'D)

Just keep going! Just keep going

straight!

VINCE

This is him. I'm telling you, this

is Nick!

ALBERT

(to VINCE)

I thought that was it.

VINCE

So he's in the next one, Albert. I

mean take it easy. I mean you're

driving everybody nuts!

VETS (V.O.)

(singing raggedly)

Three cheers for the red, white and

blue...!

VINCE

(to LINDA)

You okay?

VINCE (CONT'D)

It's gonna be the next one. Okay?

VINCE (CONT'D)

It's gotta be the next one. I mean

it's gotta be! Right, Albert?

ALBERT

Fuckin' A. It's gotta!

VINCE

It's gotta!

NICK

Guess who.

LINDA

(throws herself in his

arms)

Nick! Oh, Nick, you're back!

LINDA (CONT'D)

I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought

you were hurt, some accident. Maybe

you fell or maybe some car...

(back in his arms)

I thought someone stole you away!

NICK

No.

LINDA

Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!

LINDA (CONT'D)

How are you?

NICK

Fine. I'm fine. How are you?

LINDA

Fine. I just go along, you know.

Down at the market. Back here. I

mean it just seems there's a

million things to do!... Are you

sure you're all right? I mean, what

about the wound?

NICK

(anger)

That was nothing. That wasn't

anything.

LINDA

But --

NICK

It was just the complications. I

mean, you take a little thing over

there and then you get

complications. I mean all the guys

had it.

LINDA

I made you a sweater.

(she gets it)

Here... You have to take that off.

LINDA (CONT'D)

I couldn't remember your exact

size.

LINDA (CONT'D)

(smoothly)

Oh, that's fine. Perfect... It is a

little too big...

(she pulls the sweater

back off)

... but I can easily fix that.

Easily. One thing about wool

sweaters, they are such a cinch to

fix.

NICK

How's the trailer?

LINDA

Great. Fine... Once or twice it did

fall off the blocks. I don't know

what that's from.

NICK

Frost.

LINDA

Is that what it is? I couldn't

figure out.

NICK

Did you get hurt? You didn't get

hurt?

LINDA

Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump.

Would you like a Coke? You don't

drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What

about champagne? Let's have

champagne! I don't think we have

champagne. Let's have this. See?

Sparkling. I'll get you an opener.

Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's

just have beer. Do you want some

cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we

should have coffee.

LINDA (CONT'D)

Nick? I'm so glad you're alive! I'm

so happy! I... I just don't know

what to do!

NICK

It was all for nothing. Do you know

that? It was all for nothing.

LINDA

Nick?... I just want to say how

sorry I am about Sal and about

Merle. How... I know you loved them

and I know it's not the same. I

mean now.

NICK

Naw, it's... I mean...

LINDA

Maybe... I don't know, if you want

to talk --

NICK

Naw, it's... This guy wants his

money.

MANAGER

You did a good job, kid. Pettrucio,

mean? Have a cigar. The pears,

Pettrucio, the pears!!!

NICK

(to Linda)

Does this... I mean, how does this

job work out?

LINDA

Oh, it's great. Fine.

STOCK BOY

Hi you, hot lips.

NICK

What do they... bother you!?

LINDA

(takes his arm, laughs)

No-o-o!

NICK

I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you,

I'll kill 'em!

LINDA

(gently)

Nick. It's okay... It's okay.

(gives him a squeeze,

kisses him)

I have to go now.

LINDA (CONT'D)

Pick me up at eight.

MANAGER

That's one sweet little piece of

ass. I'm telling you, that's one

sweet little piece of ass. Who's

got these pears, God damn it! Who's

got the count on these goddamn

pears!

NICK

Hey, Albert!

VINCE

What the --!

ALBERT

It's Nick!

VINCE

Nick...?

(sees him)

Jesus, Nick!

VINCE (CONT'D)

Where the hell were you? We were

ALBERT

Yeah.

NICK

I got delayed. I --

ALBERT

(hugs him)

Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you

VINCE

Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants,

Albert! I mean, what do you think?

ALBERT

I know, but...

VINCE

What do you think? You think he's

been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's

been saving your ass, Albert.

Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!

ALBERT

Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you

must be tired.

NICK

I'm fine. Hey, I'm fine.

NICK (CONT'D)

How're you guys... I mean, how've

you guys been?

VINCE

Same old thing. Hey, same like

is getting fat.

ALBERT

Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got

married! Vince got married!

NICK

Married?

ALBERT

Tell him, Vince.

VINCE

Yeah. I did. Yeah...What the hell.

NICK

(after a beat)

Well, who'd you get married to?

VINCE

Aw, it's a long story!

ALBERT

Tell him, Vince!

VINCE

Well... you remember Cynthia?

NICK

Cynthia! Sure.

VINCE

(nods)

That's who.

NICK

(fast recovery)

Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I

ALBERT

Show him the gun. Hey, show him the

gun, Vince.

NICK

What the hell's that for?

VINCE

What's it for??

ALBERT

He's serious. Vince is fuckin'

serious!

NICK

You mean...?

VINCE

Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is

ALBERT

Vince thinks... you know...

NICK

(nods)

Hey... hey, let's drink!

STEELWORKERS

Nice going! Good going, Nick! You

room!

JOHN

Nick! Hey, Nick!

(gives him a big hug)

Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay?

You're okay, huh?

NICK

Fine. Hey, I'm fine.

JOHN

Sit down. Here. Right here.

(calls)

Albert! Vince!

JOHN (CONT'D)

Here. Here we go.

(he raises a beer)

Here's to you, Nick!

ALBERT

Fuckin' A!

VINCE

(stands)

Here's to Nick, you guys. He did

his part. He did... what hadda be

done... and so he did it... and

here he is!!!

JOHN

Rough, huh?

NICK

Rough.

(he nods)

We didn't have to do it, John.

JOHN

No?

NICK

No. How's Angela? How's she taking

it?

JOHN

Not so good.

NICK

No?

JOHN

Worse since she talked to him.

ALBERT

(with a dull beery blink)

Fucking A.

NICK

Worse since she talked to who?

JOHN

Sal.

NICK

Talked to Sal?

(stares at him)

Sal's alive?

JOHN

Kind of. You didn't know?

NICK

(pushes off the counter)

Sal's alive???

ALBERT

He's real bad, Nick.

NICK

(stares at them)

Well, where the hell is he!!! I

mean what are we all sitting here

for!!!

(tears begin streaming

down his face)

WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???

ALBERT

Nick...

VINCE

Hey, Nick...

JOHN

Nick, we don't know where Sal is...

Nick, Angela won't tell us.

NICK

Why?... What do you mean?... Why???

JOHN

Nick, she won't say why.

NICK

But Sal's mother! What about Sal's

mother!

JOHN

She's out of her tree, Nick. She is

straight out of her tree.

NICK

(stares at them)

Oh, Jesus.

NICK (CONT'D)

Oh, Jesus!!!

SAL'S MOTHER

I know I know you. So familiar.

Such a familiar face. Oh, I know

now! The toaster man! I'll go and

get it for you.

ANGELA

You're back.

NICK

Yeah.

ANGELA

I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very

glad.

NICK

Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.

ANGELA

Sure. Why not.

NICK

Where? Where is he?

ANGELA

Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital

and they're fixing him up.

NICK

You talk to him?

ANGELA

Oh, sure... Twice a day.

NICK

What hospital is he in? Where?

ANGELA

Nick... Sal is very weak. He

suffered a severe wound... and

right now he doesn't want a whole

lot of people to get involved in a

whole thing.

NICK

Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a

long way.

ANGELA

He doesn't want people bugging him,

Nick!

NICK

Angela...?

ANGELA

Did you ever think life would turn

out like this?

NICK

No.

ANGELA

You know what Sal's got now?...

Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and...

that's it.

SAL'S MOTHER

Here. This is it. What you do, you

stick this in here.

SAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)

Then you jab it, see. Jab it good.

Something's in it. Hear? Listen.

Something's in it. What? What's

there?

LINDA

It just seems sort of strange

coming to a motel... Like a

honeymoon. Or some kind of parlez

vous ... Not parlez-vous!

(she giggles)

What am I saying? That's those

cocktails! Parlez-vous!... What I

mean is rendezvous. Some kind of

rendezvous.

LINDA (CONT'D)

Do you know what I mean?... Nick?

LINDA

Nick?

LINDA (CONT'D)

Nick...? Nick, it's me!

DISSOLVE TO:

VINCE

How's it feel, huh? How's it feel

to be back?

NICK

(forced enthusiasm)

Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!

VINCE

I mean, I guess you still think

about Nam. Right? I mean --

NICK

Naw.

(shakes his head)

Uh-huh.

VINCE

Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one

of those slants?

NICK

No.

VINCE

No!

NICK

Never one.

VINCE

Oh, Jesus!

(looks around)

You're kiddin'!

NICK

One, Vince... you have to

understand, doing it with one...

would be... like nothing. They're

small, see, so if you're smart you

get about six or eight. I mean, if

you want to have any fun.

VINCE

Six or eight.

(nods)

And they go wild?

NICK

(lowers his voice)

They have these little sticks,

Vince. They call them "chomp

chomps", and when you get these

girls going, you have to stick 'em

in their mouths.

VINCE

You're full of shit!

NICK

(nods)

Yeah.

VINCE

(pounding him on the head)

And I believed you! I oughta punch

you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey,

let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey,

Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do

you say? Nick? What do you say?

NICK

Sure.

ALBERT

Hey! Fuckin' A! Hey!

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Hey, John!

JOHN

Yes, Albert?

ALBERT

(into his ear)

John,we're going huntin'.

JOHN

Who's going?

ALBERT

We're all going.

JOHN

Nick's going?

ALBERT

Nick, Vince, Albert and John.

JOHN

No women?

OTHERS

No! No women! Jesus! What are you,

crazy?

JOHN

Take these beers.

JOHN (CONT'D)

Here's to huntin'.

ALBERT

Hey! Fuckin' A!

VINCE

(hopping up and down)

Just like always! Just like it

always was! Right, Nick? Am I

right?

NICK

In the timeless words of Squire

Albert...

VINCE

Squire Albert...

NICK

In the timeless words of Squire

Albert...

ALL

(in a ragged chorus)

Hey! Fuckin' A!!!

LINDA

Nick?

NICK

Right here.

LINDA

What are you doing?

NICK

Oh. Nothing... Sitting.

LINDA

You're going hunting?

NICK

(blankly)

What?

LINDA

I see you're going hunting.

NICK

Yeah... All the guys, we're all

going huntin'. Like we did. You

know? Like we always used to.

LINDA

That's wonderful. I think you

should... fresh air.

NICK

You know how sometimes you're going

along... You're going along... And

that's all...! One thing is right

after another, like steps... And

you step along.

NICK (CONT'D)

I don't know where that is... It's

gone! That's gone!

VINCE (V.O.)

Let's go!!!

ALBERT (V.O.)

Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!

NICK

I gotta go.

NICK (CONT'D)

I'll be... I don't know... Couple

of days.

VINCE

What are you, kiddin'? Are you

kiddin' me, Albert? Twenty times I

coulda had her! She...! One time

she begged me, practically begged

me. Listen, I had her tit, which

was out, in one hand, and my other

hand... You know that mole on the

inside of her right leg? Well, I

was past that mole, way past that

mole, and I was --

VINCE (CONT'D)

(coming after them)

Nice shootin', you guys. Not bad.

Not half bad.

VINCE (CONT'D)

'Course how could you miss, right?

Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean,

if I'd'a been where you guys were --

JOHN

Psst. Vince!

JOHN

Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!

ALBERT

Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a

hot shit... except cold.

VINCE

I got this one!!! This one's

mine!!!

VINCE

I got this one!!! This one's

mine!!!

VINCE (CONT'D)

Hold your fire! I got this one!!!

VINCE (CONT'D)

I got it! I got this one!

VINCE

Gun! Gimme gun!!!

VINCE (CONT'D)

(looks around, bewildered)

Where's it gone?

JOHN

Inside, Vince.

VINCE

I got it! Hey, you guys, I got

it!!!

NICK

(grins)

Damn... God damn...

NICK

(shouts)

Hey! Hey... okay!

ALBERT

You're full of shit, Vince! You're

so full of shit you're going to

float away!

VINCE

Who? Who is?

ALBERT

You, Vince! You! You are! You're a

crock! You're a walking, talking

crock!... I mean, what do you know?

VINCE

I know! I fuckin' know!

ALBERT

You don't!

VINCE

I do!!!

ALBERT

I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince!

With twenty guys you know!

VINCE

She does not!

ALBERT

Then what's the gun for! What's

this for?

VINCE

In case!!! The gun's in case!!!

ALBERT

In case???!!! In case of what? In

case you stumble on her, suckin'

cock in the front fucking hall?!

VINCE

She might!!! She might do it,

Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell

me that she does!!!

ALBERT

She does, Vince! That's what I'm

telling you! She does!!!

VINCE

(shrieking)

Say that one more time!... Say

it!!! Go on, say it!!!

ALBERT

Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!...

Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince

goes back a long way.

NICK

(grimly)

Yeah.

VINCE

What the hell was that!

(picks up the pistol)

What did you think? Did you think

it was loaded!

NICK

You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!

VINCE

The fuck I did!!!

NICK

The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!

VINCE

What do you think? You think I

don't know!!!

NICK

I'm going to throw this fuckin'

thing away.

SAL

Hello?

NICK

Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.

SAL

Nick. Hey. How's things?

NICK

Oh. You know. How's it with you?

SAL

Same. Hey. Same old stuff.

NICK

(he can hardly hear)

What's that noise?

SAL

What?

NICK

What's that noise?

SAL

John Wayne... Listen, Nick --

NICK

Great. Hey. That's great.

SAL

Listen, Nick --

NICK

John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal.

Jesus. When are you getting out?

SAL

I'm gonna stay here, Nick.

NICK

(hearing it)

What?

SAL

(with everything he has)

Place is great. Really. One great

place... Basketball, bowling. You

name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of

guys are making salad bowls. What

I'll do is make a salad bowl for

you, unless you'd rather have a

pencil holder. The pencil holder's

neat, I mean --

NICK

Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John

Wayne's making so much noise I can

hardly --

SAL

I gotta get back, Nick.

SAL (CONT'D)

They're passing out popcorn now, so

I'll be talking to you... maybe

next year.

NICK

Sal?... Sal?

CHECKER

She's in back.

NICK

Thanks.

CHECKER

How was huntin'?

NICK

Oh. Fine.

CHECKER

Get anything?

NICK

No.

CHECKER

Too bad.

NICK

Linda... Honey, what's wrong?

LINDA

(helpless shrug)

I don't know.

NICK

Hey. Look. There must be something.

LINDA

I'm just so lonely.

NICK

C'mon. I've got the car.

LINDA

(shakes her head)

I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll

be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.

NICK

You okay?

LINDA

Let's make love, Nick.

LINDA (CONT'D)

Let's make love forever!

NICK

Sal, we need you. We need you.

SAL

Hey, Nick. How can you need me?

NICK

We do, Sal. We do... You're the

heart.

NICK (CONT'D)

Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna

sit in that corner watching soaps

and you're gonna die!... I'm not

saying it's gonna be the same. It's

not gonna be the same, but whatever

it's gonna be we're all gonna do

it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are

gonna do it!

SAL

Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin'

scared to go home.

NICK

(nods)

I know. It's like coming from the

moon. Or Mars.

SAL

Did you go hunting.

NICK

Yeah.

SAL

Did you get one?

NICK

No.

SAL

You didn't get a deer?

NICK

I tracked this one, a big buck.

God, he was such a beauty--! What's

this suitcase here?

SAL

Where?

NICK

Here. Behind you.

SAL

I don't know.

NICK

Maybe Angela brought you stuff. I

know she said --

NICK (CONT'D)

Shit!

SAL

Mom keeps sending me socks, Nick. I

mean, if it's socks or something

just let 'em go.

SAL (V.O.)

Maybe you could use socks, Nick.

Jesus, I mean, come to think of it

socks are pretty expensive now.

NICK

It's not socks, Sal.

SAL

Who is it, Nick? Who is it? I don't

understand.

NICK

It's Merle, Sal.

SAL

Merle? ... Merle's alive?

(NICK nods)

How do you know?

NICK

I saw him last night. I thought I

was dreaming. I thought I was out

of my mind.

SAL

Merle gave me this?

NICK

Yeah.

SAL

But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where

would a guy like Merle get money

like this?

NICK

Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's

getting cold, Sal. I'm going to

take you in.

(starts off)

We'll call Angela. The guys can

help her bring you home... Did I

tell you I was going on a trip?

SAL

(panicked)

Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You

said you'd be --

NICK

It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a

week. Just to see Phantom Mary.

SAL

Phantom Mary?

NICK

Didn't I ever tell you about

Phantom Mary?

SAL

(laughs)

No.

NICK

(starts off again)

Well... Phantom Mary's on my

mother's side. Naturally no one

there admits it because Phantom

Mary's pretty weird... You want to

Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty

weird... Lives alone, lives way out

called Pajamas and a cow called

Fred. Well, last week I got a call

from Phantom Mary, which in itself

was very strange...

COLONEL (CONT'D)

Lotta guys don't know that.

Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?

NICK

Yeah.

ARMAND

You are his friend.

NICK

Where is he???

ARMAND

You want to say a few words, Nick?

I think you should. Like that would

wind things up.

VINCE (CONT'D)

Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright,

everybody, Nick has a few words.

NICK

(very shaky)

I just... would like to say a few

words... about Merle. I guess Merle

always wanted something... I don't

know... better. That fucking guy,

he saved my Life. He saved Sal's...

What Merle liked, he liked things

right... But then there wasn't any

place for that... that he could

find.

VINCE

(hisses)

John! Play something!
