OFFSHORE

SUPERIMPOSITION:

OMAHA BEACH, NORMANDY

June 6, 1944

0600 HOURS

HUNDREDS OF LANDING CRAFT Each holding

thirty men, near the beaches.

THE CLIFFS

At the far end of the beach, a ninety-

foot cliff.  Topped by bunkers.

Ringed by fortified machine gun nests.

A clear line-of-fire down the entire

beach.

TEN LANDING CRAFT

Make their way toward the base of

the cliffs.  Running a gauntlet of

explosions.

SUPERIMPOSITION:

THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE

STORY THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT Plows

through the waves.

A YOUNG SOLDIER

His face covered with the remains of

the motorman.  Starts to lose it.

Begins to shudder and weep.  His

name is DeLancey.

A FIGURE

Pushes through the men.  Puts himself

in front of DeLancey.

MILLER

Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL

IN FRONT OF THEM.

MILLER

Somehow survives.  Jumps into the

breakers.

MILLER

MOVE, GODDAMN IT!  GO!  GO!  GO!

EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE

THE GERMANS On the edge of the cliff.

Rain down MACHINE GUN FIRE and

GRENADES.

THE AMERICANS

Struggle through the surf.  FIRING

up as best they can.  Making for the

base of the cliffs.

MILLER

Ignores the EXPLOSIONS and BULLETS.

Uses hand signals and curt orders.

MILLER

THERE!  THERE!  HOOKS THERE!  FIRE

SQUAD, THOSE ROCKS!

THE MEN

Obey instantly.  Set the grappling

hooks.  Take position.  Return fire.

THE MEN

Know what they have to do.  Start up

the ropes.  Into the teeth of the

German defenders.

MILLER

Back-straps his Thompson sub-machine

gun.  Starts climbing with the first

group.

THE CLIFF FACE

The Americans swarm up the ropes.

Taking turns firing up at the Germans.

HALF-WAY

An American private is HIT.  FALLS,

taking two others with him.  All

three land on the rocks below.

Another way to die.

NEAR THE TOP

Less steep.  They leave the ropes.

Free climb, scrambling up the rocks.

MILLER

Joins half-a-dozen pinned down men.

Others bottleneck behind them.  Miller

scans the route and the defenders.

MILLER

That's the route.

MILLER

Go!

THE SIX MEN

Take an instant to get ready.  Then

SCRAMBLE into the gap.

THE SIX MEN

Are CUT TO RIBBONS by MACHINE GUN

FIRE.  All KILLED.  They fall to the

rocks below.

MILLER

It's the only way.

MILLER

Turns to the next half-dozen men.

MILLER

YOU'RE NEXT!

THE SECOND SIX

Move to the head of the gap.  Miller

moves for a better angle against the

machine guns.  Calls to JACKSON, a

tall, gangly Southern country boy,

sharp-shooter.

MILLER

JACKSON, PICK OFF A FEW OF THEM,

WILL YOU?

JACKSON

(heavy Southern accent)

You betcha, Captain.

MILLER

GO!

THE SECOND SIX

Take deep breaths.  Head into the

gap.

THE SECOND SIX

Are RAKED BY MACHINE GUNS.  All are

KILLED.

MILLER

Turns, looking for the next six.

His eyes fall on Sarge and REIBEN

who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker.

Reiben smiles.

REIBEN

(heavy Brooklyn accent)

Captain, can I put in for a transfer?

MILLER

Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start

the paperwork.

THE THIRD SIX

Moves into place.  Sarge and Miller

exchange a look.  They both see the

madness of what they're doing.

MILLER

GO!

SARGE

Rolls his eyes, takes a breath.

Scrambles into the gap.  The other

five right behind.

IN THE GAP

BULLETS EVERYWHERE.

REIBEN

I'll be Goddamned!  I'm not dead!

SARGE

CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO

THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!

MILLER

I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.

MILLER

Crosses the gap.  His men follow.

AT THE CREST

The Americans swarm over the top.

FIRING.

MILLER

Okay, Wade, your turn.

MILLER AND SARGE

Survey the field.

SARGE

What the hell were you doing?  Drawing

fire!

MILLER

Worked, didn't it?

SARGE

You tryin' to get yourself killed?

MILLER

Don't need to, the Krauts go that

covered.

SUPERIMPOSITION:

WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D.C.

A CLERK

Older than the others, sad-eyed,

adds a sheet of paper to a large

pile in his out-box.

CLOSE SHOT

An outgoing telegram.  It reads:

"We regret to inform you...killed in

action...heroic service..."  This is

the paperwork of death.

THE CLERK

Pulls out a file.  Reads.  Finds

something troubling.  Quickly shuffles

through some other papers.  Finds

what he's looking for.  Rises from

his desk and hurries out of the

office.

IN THE YARD

A tire swing.  A bushel basket nailed

to the barn over a dirt basketball

court.

A PORCH SWING

Sits empty.  Moves slightly.

MARGARET RYAN

Steps out.  Around sixty.  Her face

shows the lines of a life of hard

work and mother hood.  A good woman.

GENERAL MARSHALL

(softly)

Goddamn it.

GENERAL MARSHALL

Any contact with the fourth brother,

James?

GENERAL MARSHALL

Well, if he's alive, we're going to

send someone to get him the hell out

of there.  That's just what the

General's staff wanted to hear.

SUPERIMPOSITION:

Normandy 1300 hours June 9

MILLER

Trailed by a RADIOMAN, dashes through

the fire and dives into a sludge-

filled crater.  He surfaces, sees

Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a

horrific smell.  Their conversation

is repeatedly broken by FIRING And

DUCKING GERMAN FIRE.

MILLER

Jesus Christ!  What the hell are we

swimming in?

REIBEN

Shit, sir.

SARGE

Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're

in a cranberry bog.

REIBEN

Out of the frying pan, into the

fucking latrine.

MILLER

Look at the bright side, the Krauts

sure as hell don't want to advance

and hold this cesspool.

MILLER

Get Fire Control, we need some

artillery...

REIBEN

Sir, what if they send some other

company into Caen ahead of us while

we're pinned down here?

MILLER

Don't worry, we're the only Rangers

this side of the continent, we've

got to be first into Caen.

SARGE

Who cares?

REIBEN

I care.  Don't you know what Caen's

famous for, Sarge?

SARGE

Frogs?

REIBEN

Lingerie.

SARGE

Yeah?  So?

REIBEN

So, you ever heard of employee

discounts?  My uncle sells shoes,

gets twenty-five percent off

everything in the line, got a closet

filled with the best looking shoes

you ever seen.

REIBEN

Just picture some French number been

spending all day, every day, making

cream-colored, shear-body negligees

with gentle-lift silk cups and

gathered empire waists, what the

hell you think she wears at night?

MILLER

Reiben, how the hell do you know so

much about lingerie?

REIBEN

Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's

got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in

it, from the time I could crawl, we

carry Caen lingerie, it's the best

there is, it's all I been thinking

about since the invasion.

MILLER

There's a war on, good chance they're

not still making lingerie in Caen.

REIBEN

Oh, Captain, they'll always make

lingerie, it's one of the three basic

needs of man -- food, shelter, silk

teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.

REIBEN

Happy to, sir.

MILLER

Maybe the war's over.

REIBEN

I don't think so, Captain.

MILLER

(to Radioman)

Stay at it until you get fire control.

(to Sarge)

Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.

SARGE

Yes, sir.

MILLER

Runs over the broken ground and makes

it to the sandbagged H.Q.  He stumbles

down the make-shift stairs.

MILLER

Miller, Company B, Second Rangers.

COLONEL ANDERSON

(into field-phone)

...I understand your problem, but if

we don't get those tanks off-loaded

by 0600, we're going to have an entire

division up at Caen with its ass

hanging out of its pants...

MILLER

My what?

MILLER

Find a chaplain.

COLONEL ANDERSON

(into field-phone)

...alright, let me know when.

COLONEL ANDERSON

Have the Second and Third Regiments

hold at St. Michel until we get those

tanks.  Aide Yes, sir.

COLONEL ANDERSON

Report.

MILLER

Sector four is secured, we put out

the last three German one-fifty-fives,

found them about two miles in from

Ponte du Hoc.

COLONEL ANDERSON

Resistance?

MILLER

A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery,

we took twenty-three prisoners, turned

them over to intelligence.

COLONEL ANDERSON

Casualties?

MILLER

Fourty-four, twenty one dead.

MILLER

They didn't want to give up those

one-fifty-fives, sir.

COLONEL ANDERSON

It was a hard assignment, that's why

you got it.

MILLER

Yes, sir.

COLONEL ANDERSON

Where are your men now?

MILLER

Pinned down, a mile east of here,

waiting for some help from the navy

guns.

COLONEL ANDERSON

I'm sending Simpson to take over for

you, the division is going to Caen,

you're not coming with us, I have

something else for you.

MILLER

Sir?

COLONEL ANDERSON

There's a Private James Ryan who

parachuted in with the Hundred-and-

First near Ramelle.  I want you to

take a squad up there.  If he's alive,

bring him back to the beach for

debarkation.  Take whoever you need,

you've got your pick of the company.

MILLER

A private, sir?

COLONEL ANDERSON

He's the last of four brothers, the

other three were killed in action.

This is straight from the Chief of

Staff.

MILLER

But, sir...I...I...

COLONEL ANDERSON

Spit it out, Captain.

MILLER

Respectfully, sir, sending men all

the way up to Ramelle to save one

private doesn't make a fucking,

goddamned bit of sense.

(beat)

Sir.

COLONEL ANDERSON

You think just because you hold the

Congressional Medal of Honor, you

can say any damn thing you please to

your superior officers?

MILLER

Yes, sir, more or less.

COLONEL ANDERSON

Alright, I'll give you that.

Continue.

MILLER

The numbers don't make sense, sir.

His brothers are dead, that's too

bad, but they're out of the equation.

Sending men up there is bleeding

heart crapola from three thousand

miles away.  One private is simply

not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson

This one is.  He's worth a lot more

than that.  Which is why I'm sending

you, you're the best field officer

there is.

MILLER

Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan?

Fine officer, regular church goer,

writes poetry, he might like a mission

like this.

(beat)

And he's taller than me.

COLONEL ANDERSON

That's enough, Captain, you have

your orders.  Major Thomas will fill

you in.

MILLER

Yes, sir.

COLONEL ANDERSON

Good luck, John.

MILLER

Thank you, sir.

IN THE CRATERS

Miller's Ranger company ducks and

covers.  The BARRAGE SUBSIDES.  The

Rangers rise, FIRING, leap-frogging

from crater to crater, advancing

against the remaining Germans who

return SMALL ARMS FIRE.

MILLER

Crouch-runs and dives into a crater

with Sarge.

MILLER

Put on your traveling shoes, Sarge,

we're heading out.

SARGE

Caen?

MILLER

I wish.  You and I are taking a squad

up to Ramelle on a public relations

mission.

SARGE

You?  Leading a squad?

MILLER

Some private up there lost three

brothers, got a ticket home.

SARGE

What about the company?

MILLER

Simpson.

SARGE

Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking

pogo stick!

MILLER

I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with

his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.

SARGE

Beasley's dead.

MILLER

Okay, Wade.  Translators?

SARGE

Fresh out.

MILLER

What about Talbot?

SARGE

Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn,

I'll go see if I can find another

one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and

Wade, meet me at transport.

SARGE

Yes, sir.

SUPPLY SERGEANT

GET THOSE GODDAMNED HALF-TRACKS OUT

OF THERE!

SERGEANT

THEN UNBLOCK 'EM!

MILLER

Strides through the chaos, avoiding

the passing vehicles.  He sees his

men and walks toward them.  Reiben

hurries up to Miller, pleading.

REIBEN

Please, sir, you can't take me to

Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir,

please, I told you, they make Caen

lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's

the best there is, it's...oh, please,

sir...

MILLER

Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're

the best.

REIBEN

(desperate)

No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or

what about Faulkner?  Or that little

guy with the glasses?

MILLER

Trust me, you're the best.

REIBEN

(whimpering)

But, sir...

SARGE

You get a translator, Captain?

MILLER

I've got a line on one.

TRANSPORT OPERATIONS TABLE

Chaos.  Vehicles THUNDERING by.  The

Supply Sergeant juggles runners and

paperwork.  Miller steps up to him.

MILLER

Sergeant, I need a truck.

SUPPLY SERGEANT

Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how

'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top,

red with black interior.

MILLER

White-walls?

SUPPLY SERGEANT

No white-walls, sir, there's a war

on.

(to the Private)

NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER

THERE!

(to Miller)

I can't help you, sir.

MILLER

A half-track, anything.

SUPPLY SERGEANT

Sorry, sir.  Division is using

everything on wheels to get up to

Caen.

(notices Miller's

shoulder patch)

How come you guys aren't going?

MILLER

How about that jeep?

SUPPLY SERGEANT

That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog

told me if anyone breathes on it,

I'll get busted and if anyone so

much as touches it with their little

finger, I'll get court marshaled.

If you were to take it, they'd shoot

me.

JACKSON

Cap'n, does that mean we got to walk

all the way up to Ramelle?

SUPPLY SERGEANT

What's at Ramelle beside a lot of

Germans.

MILLER

A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going

home, if he's alive.

SUPPLY SERGEANT

Senator's son?

MILLER

No, three brothers of his were killed

in action.  Command wants him out of

there.

SUPPLY SERGEANT

Damn...I got a couple brothers...

GENERAL GAVIN

SERGEANT, WHERE THE HELL IS MY

GODDAMNED JEEP!?

MILLER

We've got to make one stop.

MILLER

Wait here.

MILLER

I understand you speak French and

German.

MILLER

Do you have an accent?

MILLER

Good, you've been re-assigned to me,

we're going to Ramelle.

MILLER

That's my understanding.

MILLER

Do you have a problem with that,

Corporal?

MILLER

I need a translator, all mine have

been killed.

MILLER

It'll come back to you.  Get your

gear.

MILLER

A small one.

MILLER

Go, go...

REIBEN

Captain, can I ask you a question?

MILLER

Sure, Reiben.

REIBEN

Where are you planning on putting

Private Ryan, sir?

REIBEN

(continuing)

It's just that it's kind of crowded

back here, I was wondering if you're

expecting to have more room on the

way back?

MILLER

Left.

MILLER

Now we've got a straight shot, due

north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles,

two villages between here and there,

St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take

the jeep as far as we can, then go

on on foot.

SARGE

We in radio contact with anybody up

there?

MILLER

Somebody put the wrong crystals in

every one of the Hundred-and-First's

radios the night before the drop,

not one of them works.  We're going

in blind.

REIBEN

I usually like surprises.

SARGE

What are we likely to run into?

MILLER

A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut

divisions, no fronts, no lines, the

drops were completely fouled up,

we've got little pockets of

paratroopers all over the place,

trying to hang on.  Command says we

hold St. Mere, but north of that,

it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's

where he's supposed to be, he's more

than likely dead.

SARGE

Hell of a mission.

MILLER

Yep, hell of a mission.

REIBEN

(to Wade)

You want to shoot him, or should I?

REIBEN

(politely)

Jackson?

JACKSON

Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal,

Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.

MILLER

I don't want anybody to shoot him,

that's an order.  He speaks French

and his German has a touch of the

Bavarian.

UPHAM

(continuing)

...who won the Congressional Medal

of Hon...?

REIBEN

Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony

of this mission is fucking killing

me.

MILLER

Yeah, how so?

REIBEN

I should be on my way to Caen, sir.

It's like Beethoven, the guy's one

of the greatest composers ever lived

and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean,

who'd he piss off?  And here I am,

the Beethoven of ladies foundation

garments, one step away from Caen,

the center of the known lingerie

universe and instead, I'm going to

Ramelle to save some fucking private

who's probably already dead.

MILLER

There's to be a bright side, look

for it.

REIBEN

Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous

for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company

is going to Caen and we're going to

the goddamned cheese capital of

France.  There is no bright side.

MILLER

There's always a bright side.

REIBEN

I'm listening, sir.

MILLER

Well, I, for one, like cheese.

REIBEN

Well, you're a happy idiot.

MILLER

How's the road up to St. Mere?

MILLER

Anybody getting through?

IN THE BACK

The men bounce up and down like

stuffed animals, doing their best to

not be thrown out.

REIBEN

Hell, this is better than Coney

Island!

A HUGE BUMP

Bounces Reiben up and slams his back

down on his shovel.  He HOLLERS IN

PAIN.

MILLER

Just trying to make room for Ryan.

MILLER

(sweetly)

Sarge?

ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES

Thirty yards ahead of them.

MILLER

Directs Sarge off the road.

MILLER

They've got the road zeroed.

SARGE

Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep

off the road.

THE JEEP BOUNCES

Off the shoulder.  Nearly throwing

everyone out.  Somehow they hang on.

The jeep tears along the rutted field.

ANOTHER EXPLOSION

Just behind them.

SARGE DRIVES MADLY

Not slowing down.  Trying to avoid

the biggest ruts and bumps.

ANOTHER EXPLOSION

Close on their side.  Showers them

with debris.

SARGE

Jesus Christ!

MILLER

They've got a hell of a spotter

somewhere.

ANOTHER EXPLOSION

Even closer.  The jeep's PEPPERED

WITH SHRAPNEL.  They BARREL THROUGH

the smoke.

MILLER

S-curves, Sarge.

SARGE

Turns shallow curves without slowing

down.

SARGE AND MILLER

Hang on.  Stay in the jeep but are

battered.  All stunned.  MILLER Is

first to regain his bearings.  Jumps

up.  Checks out the jeep.  Undamaged.

Deep in the soft dirt.

MILLER

Sarge!  Reverse!

MILLER

COME ON!  YOU WANNA WALK?

STILL DAZED

Reiben, Wade, Jackson, Upham screw

their heads back on.  Shoulder into

the jeep.  Push for all they're worth.

The WHEELS STILL SPIN.

MILLER IGNORES IT

He's the only one who does.

SARGE

Captain, they got us zeroed.

UPHAM

That's bracketing, right?

UPHAM

I know about bracketing.  I read

about it.  The next one is going to

land right on us.

MILLER

FORWARD!  FORWARD!

(beat)

NOW REVERSE!

SARGE

Uh, Captain...

MILLER

PUSH!

SARGE

Uh, Captain...

THE TIRES SCREAM

A bit more progress.  It's almost

out.

SARGE

(sweetly)

Oh, Captain...

ONE MORE PUSH

The jeep rocks back in, deeper.

MILLER

SHIT!

MILLER

GO!

THE MEN

Instantly take off.  Away from the

jeep.  As fast as they can.

DIRECT HIT

OBLITERATING THE JEEP

THE MEN

Barely out of the BLAST PERIMETER.

STUNNED by the concussion.  SHOWERED

with dirt, rock and debris.

MILLER

Is first up.  Sarge and the men

struggle to their feet.  Hear MORE

INCOMING.  Miller grabs Upham by the

collar and pulls him up.

MILLER

HERE COME THE MORTARS!

THE FIELD

The six Americans run madly, in zig-

zag patterns through the gauntlet of

MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  BOOM

RUNNING, STUMBLING

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM

THE EXPLOSIONS STOP

THE MEN ALL STOP Panting.  Struggling

to catch their breath. Check their

body parts.  Everything's there.

They have their weapons, most of

their gear.

REIBEN

General Gavin is going to be very

irritated at you, Captain.

MILLER

Stands on the edge of the woods,

almost in a trance.

UPHAM

Captain, I...

SARGE

Sssssh!

MILLER

Sarge, maps.

MILLER

Two eighty-eights, just under two-

and-a-half miles, that way, vector

from the jeep, through those two

trees at the base of the hill.  The

mortars came from behind that rise,

there, four of them.

MILLER

Wade, the radio.

UPHAM

You can tell all that, just by the

sound, sire?

MILLER

That's not all.  There were nine

gunners on the eighty-eights, one

had a broken heel on his boot, two

had bratwurst for supper last night,

one of them is named Fritz, the other,

Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard

to tell.

JACKSON

Corporal, you have just seen one of

Captain Miller's many God-given

talents.  If, by some miracle, you

survive, you will witness many more

of them.

SARGE

Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care

of those eighty-eights?

MILLER

That's not what we're here for.

WADE

(re. radio)

I've got command, Captain.

MILLER

(into radio)

This is Baker Charley One, fire mark,

sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four-

three by baker-three.  Two eighty-

eights.  Tell our boys to come in

low from the east in case the Krauts

have ack-ack.  Good hunting.  Over.

SARGE

He's right, Captain, it might be

kind of dangerous for those flyboys.

MILLER

Tell that to Private James Ryan.

We've got our orders.  Let's go.

UPHAM

So, where are you from?

REIBEN

Get lost.

UPHAM

So, where are you from?

JACKSON

You writin' a book or somethin'?

UPHAM

As a matter of fact, I am.

JACKSON

Figured.

WADE

I'm Wade, that's spelled, W-A-D-E,

I'm small but wiry, with piercing,

steel-gray eyes, and a rough-hewn

but handsome face, I'm from Colorado,

my father's a mining engineer, don't

you take notes?

UPHAM

Demolition, right?

WADE

Since I was nine years old.  They

got a lot of explosives around mines.

Me and my little brother could get

into any warehouse you ever saw.

Damn, we had fun!

JACKSON

I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork,

Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher.

Him and his two brothers got a

ministry, The Blessed Church of the

Wandering Gospel.

UPHAM

In West Fork?

JACKSON

In the back of a nineteen and thirty-

one stretch Hudson with a big ole'

trailer.

UPHAM

No kidding.

JACKSON

I don't make jokes about things of,

or related to, the preaching of the

Holy Gospel, including the ministerial

calling of my family.

UPHAM

So they travel around from place to

place and preach?

JACKSON

We got us a tent, forty-two feet

across, eighteen feet at center,

hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs.

Circuit's eleven towns, covers all

'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller

County.  I expect that upon completion

of my military service I will be

joinin' said ministry.

UPHAM

What about the Captain?  Where's he

from?

JACKSON

You figure that out, you got yourself

one nice prize.

SARGE

Over three hundred bucks, last I

heard.  Wade Company's got a pool,

five bucks gets you in, whoever

guesses where the Captain's from and

what he did as a civilian gets it

all.

JACKSON

The whole kit and caboodle.

UPHAM

But everybody's heard of him, he won

the Congressional Medal of Honor, he

saved a dozen men.

REIBEN

We know.

UPHAM

Somebody must know where he's from,

what he did for a living.

SARGE

Somebody probably does.

UPHAM

Why don't you just ask him?

JACKSON

The Captain prefers not to discuss

certain aspects of his life, in

particular, everything up to and

including his enlistment in the United

States Army.

SARGE

I've been with him since Anzio.  I'm

closer to him that I am to my own

brother but I don't even know what

state he's from.  Somewhere in the

Northeast as near as I can figure.

I don't even have a clue what he did

for a living as civilian.

REIBEN

No one's gonna win the money for the

simple reason that the Captain never

was a civilian.  They assembled him

at O.C.S. out of spare body parts

from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a

fact.

JACKSON

(defensively)

You got somethin' against the Cap'n?

REIBEN

Hell, no.  I think he's the best

officer in the whole goddamned army,

bar none.

JACKSON

You got that right.

JACKSON

Captain, my feet are most

uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we

was gonna have to walk all the way

to Ramelle, I never would 'a

volunteered for this here mission.

MILLER

You didn't volunteer, Jackson.

JACKSON

I most likely would have, sir, had I

been given the opportunity.

REIBEN

If we find Ryan and he's still alive,

that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry

this goddamned B.A.R. back to the

beach for me.

JACKSON

Army life is too dang easy, my feet

have gone soft.  Back home, we go

out squirrel huntin', I walk forever

and a day and then some, don't even

raise a blister.

REIBEN

You know what a B.A.R. weighs?

Nineteen and a half pounds, not

counting ammo.

(re. ammo bandoleers)

And you think these things are

comfortable?  They may look good but

they weigh twelve pounds each, that's

thirty-six pounds, right there.

WADE

So what?  I've got three satchel

charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen-

and-a-half pineapples, and all my

regular gear.  You don't hear me

complaining.

REIBEN

That's because, as I have pointed

out on numerous occasions, you are a

happy idiot.

WADE

No, I just happen to take the

Captain's advice and look at the

bright side of things.

UPHAM

How do you do it?

WADE

It's easy, it runs in my family,

take my grandfather, for example...

REIBEN

Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to

that grandfather thing again.

WADE

As I was saying, before I was so

rudely interrupted, my grandfather

got old, as grandfathers tend to do.

He needed someone to take care of

him.  We move around all the time,

going from one mine to another, so

we had to put him in a home.  Nice

enough place but kind of depressing.

But not for Granddad.  He just

convinced himself he was on a cruise

ship, going to Tahiti, he had his

own cabin, first class, with room

service.  It just so happened that

the weather was always lousy, so he

never bothered to go up on deck.

Happiest guy you ever saw until the

day he died.

UPHAM

You think he really believed it?

WADE

Who knows?  It worked.

REIBEN

Fine, you convince yourself you got

a pack full of feathers and goddamned

Private James Ryan can carry my

fucking gear.

WADE

Reiben, you can be very unpleasant

to be around sometimes.

REIBEN

You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I

can do much better than this.

WADE

Look at Upham, you don't hear him

complaining.

UPHAM

Well, as a matter of fact, I was

just thinking...

UPHAM

(continuing)

That I'm so fucking tired of this

goddamned walking, I'd pay a thousand

dollars to see that bastard Ryan

crawl on his belly over an acre of

broken glass to hear my great-aunt

Martha fart through a field-phone.

REIBEN

Jesus Christ, he's a natural!

MILLER

Upham, are you sure you've never

been in combat?

MILLER

He's good.

JACKSON

Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable.

MILLER

Stay low.

JACKSON

Dang!  That was close!

MILLER

Your turn.

MILLER

Zig-zag, change your pace a couple

times, you'll be alright.

MILLER

Okay, I'm going to draw fire for

you.

(sternly)

But if I do, you goddamned well better

go.

MILLER

Looks to Upham

MILLER

Ready?

MILLER

Go.

REIBEN

Hey, that guy can move.

SARGE

(under his breath so

only Miller can hear)

Damn fool.

(beat)

Sir.

REIBEN

Captain, he's fast!

MILLER

(glances at Sarge,

speaks to Reiben)

Glad of it.

UPHAM

On the other side of the street,

crouches in a doorway with Jackson.

Upham is a bit in shock, less from

the nearness of the bullets than

from what Miller just did for him.

MILLER

DASHES across the street.

MILLER

Bring 'em over.

UPHAM

Captain, I...

MILLER

One at a time.

MILLER

Ducks out of the doorway and crouch-

runs down the block.  He passes a:

BOMBED OUT BUILDING

Out of the line of fire.  A dozen

dead American soldiers lined up on

the ground.  The battered, bloody

bodies, only partially covered by

ponchos.

MILLER

Sees the dead and wounded, shows no

reaction.  Runs to:

AN ALLEY

Captain Hamill and his men are bunched

there, out of the line of fire.

He's sending off a squad to continue

their door-to-door.

MILLER

We had a jeep until a few hours ago,

a nice one, it had a cute little

flag with a couple of stars on it.

MILLER

We called in a strike on the eighty-

eights that took it out, but it's

the Kraut spotter that counts,

wherever the hell that bastard is.

MILLER

Jackson.

UPHAM

What is that?

JACKSON

Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel

with dual-groove, parallel rifling,

elevated three-glass scope and a

single-throw hammer.

UPHAM

The Army gave you that?

JACKSON

Yep.

UPHAM

You must be a hell a shot.

JACKSON

Not where I come from.

UPHAM

That must be four thousand yards.

JACKSON

(without taking his

eye from the scope)

Forty-two-hundred, I figure.

UPHAM

You take account of the wind?

REIBEN

(put-on Southern accent)

Dang right, he take 'count of the

wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a

Kentucky windage?

JACKSON

Reiben, how many time I got to tell

you, I'm from Tennessee.

REIBEN

They got squirrels there, too, right?

MILLER

Very far, they're not coming this

way, they're going to take Caen first.

MILLER

Five, but we not staying, we're on

our way to Ramelle.

MILLER

Yeah, you know about that?

MILLER

Wonderful.

MILLER

How do we get out of here?

MILLER

Yeah?

MILLER

Thanks.

MILLER

Let's find someplace to hole up.

UPHAM

Sir, I'm sorry about what happened,

I...

MILLER

(interrupting)

It was nothing.

UPHAM

But you could have gotten killed and

I...

MILLER

(interrupting)

Like I said, it was nothing.

(to the men)

Don't bunch up.

UPHAM

Did you see what he did, back there?

He stepped right into the open, so I

could get across.

JACKSON

Shit, that was no big deal.

WADE

They can't kill him.

SARGE

Like hell they can't.

REIBEN

Wade's right, it's some kind of

scientific, magnetic thing, I can't

explain it, but I've seen it.

WADE

We all have, he's got nine lives, or

he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.

SARGE

No one's bulletproof.  No one.

(beat)

C'mon, stay low.

REIBEN

Captain, could you please explain

the math of this mission to me?

MILLER

Sure, what do you want to know?

REIBEN

Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms,

since when does six equal one?  What's

the sense in risking six guys to

save one?

MILLER

Ours is not to reason why.

REIBEN

Huh?

MILLER

Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick

up this kid, high-tail it back to

division, everything'll work out

fine.

REIBEN

I'd much rather die in Caen than

Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.

MILLER

Reiben, there's a fairly good chance

you're not going to die at all.

REIBEN

Easy for you to say, sir.

(beat)

Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring

his fucking neck.

SARGE

Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor

bastard's mother.

REIBEN

Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you

got a mother?

JACKSON

Last I knew.

REIBEN

Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of

us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain

has a mother.

REIBEN

Well, maybe not the Captain, but the

rest of us have mothers.

MILLER

You have orders, too.

JACKSON

Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

MILLER

I'd love to hear it.

JACKSON

Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is

a serious misallocation of valuable

military resources.  Miller Go on.

JACKSON

Well, sir, by my way a thinkin' I am

a finely made instrument of warfare.

What I mean by that is, if you was

to put me with this here sniper rifle

anywhere up to and includin' one

mile from Adolf Hitler, with a clear

line of sight, war's over.

MILLER

Reiben, I want you to listen closely

to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe.

Jackson, continue.

JACKSON

Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that

the entire resources of the United

States Army oughta be dedicated to

one thing and one thing only, and

that is to put me and this here weapon

on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle

of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one

to question decisions made up on

high, sir, but it seems to me that

saving one private, no matter how

grievous the losses of his family,

is a waste of my God-given talent.

MILLER

Wade?

WADE

Hell, I don't mind this mission,

sir, as long as there's something up

at Ramelle for...

REIBEN

(finishing Wade's

sentence)

...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah,

we heard that.

MILLER

Upham?

UPHAM

Pass.

MILLER

Sarge?

SARGE

I'm just here to keep a bunch of

numb-nuts, including one certain,

frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate,

from getting themselves killed.

REIBEN

And what about you, Captain?

MILLER

Reiben, what's the matter with you?

I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain.

There's a chain of command.  Griping

goes one way, up, only up, never

down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to

my superior officers.  Up, get it?

I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe

in front of you.  How long you been

in the army?

REIBEN

I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.

(beat)

But if you weren't a captain, or if

I were a major, what would you say?

MILLER

In that case, I would say this is an

excellent mission, with an extremely

valuable objective, worthy of my

best efforts.

MILLER

(continuing)

In addition, as I pointed out earlier,

I have a fondness for cheese and I

hope to have the opportunity to sample

some of the Ramelle products, when

we arrive there, to see if they live

up to their excellent reputation.

Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow

for the mother of Private James Ryan

and I'm more than willing to lay

down my life, and the lives of my

men, especially you, Reiben, to help

relieve her suffering.  The men

thoroughly enjoy the performance.

REIBEN

Sir, if you were not a captain, I

would compliment you, now, for being

an excellent liar.

MILLER

But I am a captain.  If I were not a

captain, I would thank you for the

compliment and tell you that the

ability to lie comes from being a

top-notch poker player, which I am,

having learned at the side of my

mother who is, by popular acclaim,

the best poker player in...

MILLER

(continuing)

...my home town, which shall remain

un-named.

MILLER

Any further thoughts on the subject?

REIBEN

Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like

to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle,

fuck the cheese capital of France

and while we're at it, fuck Private

James Ryan.

MILLER

I'll make a note of your suggestions

but I'll leave that last one to you,

especially if he's already dead.

MILLER

We move out in two hours, try and

get some sleep.

SARGE

You ever going to open those letters?

Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.

MILLER

Maybe.

SARGE

It's not normal, not reading letters

from home.

MILLER

Since when have things been normal?

SARGE

You got me.  Afraid of bad news?

MILLER

Nope.

SARGE

Good news?

SARGE

You think they'll be alright?

MILLER

They're fine.  As long as they can

gripe, they'll be alright.

SARGE

And what about you?

MILLER

They guys here aren't going to be

able to hold out until battalion

shows up.

SARGE

Nope.

MILLER

Command isn't going to let them

withdraw and the Germans sure as

hell aren't going to let them

surrender.

SARGE

Three for three.

MILLER

If we stayed, we could make a

difference.

SARGE

You're kidding yourself.

MILLER

You never know.

SARGE

I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.

MILLER

Now you're the one kidding yourself.

(beat)

Hell of  a mission.

SARGE

Yup, hell of a mission.

MILLER

Rise and shine, boys.  Let's go.

SARGE

(awe-struck)

Makes you feel small, doesn't it?

MILLER

It doesn't take this.

UPHAM

I wasn't made for this.

MILLER

(bitterly)

You think the rest of us were?

MILLER

Don't worry, Upham, God'll protect

you, this shit's gonna keep him up

all night, anyway.

MILLER

Let's go, this ain't what they pay

us for.

REIBEN

(gently)

Just what I need.

MILLER

Thanks, but you may need these more

than us, or Ryan.

MILLER

Let's move out.

MILLER

A couple of weeks.  It started in

Portsmouth when they brought us down

for loading.

SARGE

Is it getting worse?

MILLER

No.  It comes and goes.  It stops

when I look at it.

SARGE

You may have to find yourself a new

line of work, this one doesn't seem

to agree with you anymore.

MILLER

I'll be alright.

MILLER

It'll be light, soon.  Let's pick it

up.

MILLER

It looks like a Renoir.

UPHAM

Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth

Symphony, The Normandy?

MILLER

I've been humming it.

UPHAM

I heard.

MILLER

It seemed appropriate.

UPHAM

You know classical music?

MILLER

Some.

UPHAM

Where are you from, Captain?

MILLER

What's the pool up to?

UPHAM

Over three-hundred.

MILLER

I'll tell you what, if I'm still

alive when it hits five-hundred,

I'll let you know and we'll split

the money.

UPHAM

If that's the way you feel, why don't

we wait until it's up to a thousand.

MILLER

I don't expect to live that long.

UPHAM

Five hundred, then.

MILLER

Let's go, private.

UPHAM

Five nights ago, he found this

paratrooper caught in a tree with a

broken leg.  The leg got infected.

Last night he went to Ville Cholet

to get a doctor.  The doctor refused

to come and when he got back, this

is what he found.  The Krauts must

have shown up while he was gone.

MILLER

Did he see any sign of them?

UPHAM

No, but he heard firing, just east,

less that a kilometer.

MILLER

Thank him and tell him we're sorry

about his loss.

WADE

Captain.

MILLER

Where?

JACKSON

In the shadow by those two trees.

MILLER

My guess, too.

UPHAM

What is it?

MILLER

A machine gun.

REIBEN

Sir, I've got an idea, let's go

around.

MILLER

We can't leave it here.

JACKSON

We left them eighty-eights.

MILLER

They don't send planes to put out

machine guns.

(beat)

Two flank runners with surpressing

fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes

left has to be fast.

UPHAM

Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.

REIBEN

He's fast, Captain, I saw him.

WADE

How fast?

UPHAM

Twenty-four-five.

WADE

Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty-

two flat.

MILLER

Wade goes left.

UPHAM

Twenty-two flat?

WADE

I would have won the states if some

bastard hadn't tripped me in the

finals.

MILLER

Sarge, Upham, here.  Jackson, Reiben,

ten yards, either side.

SARGE

Rule of thumb, Captain, says you

ought to detail this one, instead of

going yourself.

MILLER

Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?

SARGE

How about I go right, sir?

MILLER

How about you take your position?

SARGE

How about...?

MILLER

(interrupting)

How about you shut up and take your

position?

SARGE

Yes, sir.

UPHAM

Good luck, Captain.

MILLER

Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got

five lives.

UPHAM

The men said, nine.

MILLER

What do they know?

(beat)

I had nine, but I feel through the

ice when I was seven, my brother

pulled me out.  Then I used one when

a grenade landed in my foxhole in

Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one

on the beaches, one on the cliffs

and two getting here.

UPHAM

That only leaves three.

MILLER

Plenty.

MILLER

Ready?

WADE

Yes, sir.

IN THE NEST

A squad of Germans, dug deep, BLASTING

THE MACHINE GUN, a BIG SCHWARZLOSE

8MM, a stunningly powerful weapon.

Four Germans in the nest, four more

outlying riflemen.

MILLER

Takes the FIRST FIRE.  He HITS THE

DIRT.  The BULLETS SCREAM just over

him.

SARGE

FIRES A LONG BURST from his Thompson.

No effect.  Pissed.  POPS THE CLIP.

SLAMS in another.  FIRES.

WADE

Ten more yards.  Too slow.  A deadly

row of BULLETS KICK UP DIRT toward

him.

MILLER

Makes it to the far side.  Scrambles

up the roots.  Dives through the

brush.

WADE

On a slight rise.  Can't hit the

dirt.  A line of bullets.  Desperately

sprints.

MILLER

STRUGGLES through the hedgerow.

Stumbles onto the path.  Rolls to

his feet, running.  Swings his

Thompson into firing position.  Racing

toward the nest.

MILLER

Tearing along the path.  Sees a German

rifleman.  FIRES A BURST.  CUTS HIM

DOWN.  Runs over the body without

breaking stride.

MILLER

TEARS THROUGH THE TREES.  BLASTS his

Thompson.  CUTS DOWN two more German

riflemen.  Grabs a grenade.  Pulls

the pin.

THE NEST

The Germans see Miller coming.  Wheel

from Sarge.  Too late.

MILLER

THROWS the grenade, VEERS and DIVES.

SARGE

HOLD YOUR FIRE!

MILLER

Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another

BURST.  KILLS the last of the German

riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto

the field.

WADE

Lies in the grass.  Holding his belly.

Astonished by the pain.

MILLER

REIBEN, UPHAM, PERIMETER!  COVER!

REIBEN AND UPHAM

Stop instantly.  Turn toward the

perimeter of the field.

SARGE

Roots through his medical kit as he

runs.  Dropping and scattering

inessentials behind him.

WADE

Wide-eyed.  Not even writhing.  Too

much pain.

SARGE

Pulls Wade's hands from the wound.

Pours sulfa powder.

MILLER

About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the

wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.

MILLER

Damn it!

SARGE

Fumbles with a second sulfa bag.

SARGE

Sulfa, more sulfa...

WADE

Frozen in agony.  Looks at Miller.

Sees him preparing the morphine shot.

They both know.

WADE

Yeah...morphine...make it a

double...huh...Captain...?

MILLER

SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck.

Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine

straight to Wade's brain.  Motions

impatiently to Sarge.

MILLER

More morphine, hurry up, come on,

come on...

SARGE

Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa.

Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the

morphine.

MILLER

Snatches the morphine from Sarge.

Quickly and efficiently prepares a

second shot.  He's done this before.

REIBEN

On guard, glancing back.  Pissed

off.

REIBEN

Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn

it...

UPHAM

Freaked out.  Trying to keep his

eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.

JACKSON

Watching.

MILLER

Gives Wade the second shot.

WADE

Feels the effects of the first shot.

He sees Upham and manages a pained

smile.

REIBEN

Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn

it...

MILLER

Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently

closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers

slightly as he unclips one of Wades

dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it.

Sarge notices.

UPHAM

That was no twenty-two flat.

MILLER

He lied.  Let's move out.

REIBEN

Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him,

just fuck the goddamned son-of-a-

bitch.

JACKSON

Shut up, will you?

REIBEN

You shut up, this is the most fucked

up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned

Ryan, fuck the little bastard.

JACKSON

Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.

REIBEN

The hell he didn't.

MILLER

Keep it down.

MILLER

We've got to find someplace to hole

up for a bit.

SARGE

You alright?

MILLER

Let's just find someplace.

MILLER

Rest.  One hour.  Jackson, Reiben,

perimeter.  Keep your eyes open.

I'm going to re-con.

MILLER

What was the name of that kid at

Anzio, the one who got his face burned

off?

SARGE

Vecchio.

MILLER

Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember

his name, he was a good kid, remember

how he used to walk on his hands and

sing that song about the man on flying

trapeze?

SARGE

Yeah.

MILLER

You know why I'm such a good officer?

Because of my mother.  Have I ever

told you about her?

SARGE

Bits and pieces.

MILLER

She's the best poker player you ever

saw.  My father used to go to these

Saturday night games and lose his

shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him

an ultimatum, either she gets a

regular seat at the table or she

locks him in every Saturday night.

He squawked and so did his buddies

but after a while they gave in and

from the first night she sat down,

she never lost.  She could read those

cocky bastards like they were playing

open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had

sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her

eyes, the tone of her voice, her

bets, her jokes, the way she sipped

her coffee, she was a master.  She

won more money on shit hands than

anyone in the history of the game.

Every Saturday night, my father would

lose two, three hundred bucks and

she'd win it all back and then some.

And I'd stand there, glued to her

shoulder, from the time I was five

years old, watching every hand, every

move, studying how she did it.

(beat)

That's why I'm such a good officer,

I can look at a man's face and tell

you exactly what he's holding, and

if it's a shit hand, I know just

what cards to deal him.

SARGE

And what about your own hand?

MILLER

No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less?

So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear

me apart when I'd get one of my men

killed, but what was I supposed to

do?  Break down in front of the ones

who were standing there waiting for

me to tell them what to do?  Of course

not, so I bluffed, and after a while,

I started to fall for my own bluff.

It was great, it made everything so

much easier.  Sarge Is that why your

hand's been shaking?

MILLER

It could be worse.  You know the

first thing they teach you at O.C.S.?

Lie to your men.

SARGE

Oh, yeah?

MILLER

Not in so many words, but they tell

you you can have all the firepower

in the world and if your men don't

have good morale, it's not worth a

damn.  So if you're scared or empty

or half-a-step from a Section Eight,

do you tell your men?  Of course

not.  You bluff, you lie.

SARGE

And how do you bluff yourself?

MILLER

Simple, numbers.  Every time you

kill one of your men, you tell

yourself you just saved the lives of

two, three, ten, a hundred others.

We lost, what, thirty-one on the

cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times

that number by putting out those

guns.  That's over three hundred

men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand.

Then thousand.  Any number you want.

See?  It's simple.  It lets you always

choose mission over men.

SARGE

Except this time, the mission IS a

man.

MILLER

That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's

Ryan?  If they're both standing in

front of me and I have to shoot one

or the other, how do I choose?  Look

at my hand, there it goes again.

SARGE

John, I've got to tell you, I think

you're about used up.

MILLER

I think you're right, Keith.

SARGE

You want me to take over?

MILLER

No, but if I get any worse, you'll

have to relieve me.

SARGE

(sighs)

Just what I want to do.

MILLER

You know Wade was the eleventh of

the twelve, you're the last one still

alive.

SARGE

I know.

MILLER

Don't let yourself get killed, if

you do, they might make me give back

the medal and then I won't be able

to lip off to colonels anymore.

SARGE

I'll do my best.

(BEAT)

Ah, forget it.

MILLER

Thanks for drawing that machine gun

off me.

SARGE

You're welcome, John.

MILLER

But, that's my personal brand of

stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary

about it, if you do it again, you're

busted.

SARGE

Yes, sir.

MILLER

Up.  We're moving out.

REIBEN

I thought you said we had an hour,

sir?

MILLER

Well now I'm saying we're moving

out.  Get off your ass.

MILLER

What the hell's the matter with you,

Jackson?

JACKSON

Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on

account of Wade.

MILLER

Who's Wade?

MILLER

I said, who the hell is Wade?

JACKSON

Sir, I understand what you're doin',

but I respectfully request permission

to grieve in my own manner.

MILLER

You'll grieve the way I tell you to

goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade,

there was one, but he died a long

time ago, he's been dead for so long

you can hardly remember his name,

you understand?

JACKSON

Sir, I understand.  I don't like it,

but I understand.

MILLER

Good, now get your goddamned gear.

REIBEN

You know what the best possible thing

that could happen is?

JACKSON

Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get

lockjaw, never say another word as

long as you live.

REIBEN

I've given this a lot of thought,

sir.  The best thing that could happen

is, we find Ryan and he's dead.

MILLER

Why's that?

REIBEN

Well, sir, consider the possibilities.

A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take

him back to the beach.  Knowing you,

you don't let him carry my gear,

even though he really should, and we

all get killed, trying to keep him

alive.

MILLER

Except for the last part, that one's

not bad.

REIBEN

B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown

up by the German equivalent of Wade,

whose name I know you don't want me

to mention.  There's nothing to find.

The biggest piece is the size of a

pea.  We wander around, looking for

him until the Germans pick us off,

one after another.

MILLER

I don't like that one.

REIBEN

Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is

the worst one, we find Ryan and he's

wounded.  Not only does he not carry

my gear, we have to carry his gear.

And him.

MILLER

But we accomplish the mission.

REIBEN

Maybe.  But what if he dies on the

way back?  you see what I'm saying,

sir?  The best possible situation

is, he's dead, we find his body,

more or less intact, we grab one of

his dog-tags and high-tail it back

to the beach, or better yet, we head

over to Caen and catch up with

division.

MILLER

Has anyone ever told you, you're

officer material?

REIBEN

No, sir.

MILLER

That's a mystery to me.

SARGE

Looks like we're going to beat those

Kraut companies to Ramelle.

MILLER

I don't think so.

GERMAN FLANK SQUADS

Hurry along the fields on either

side of the road, trying to keep up

with the vehicles.  MILLER AND HIS

MEN Catch a glimpse of an approaching

German Flank Squad.  They flatten

themselves into the mucky water.

Ready their weapons.  Prepare to

fire.

THE GERMAN SQUAD

Approaches the bridge.

MILLER

Is just about to open up on them.

THE GERMAN SERGEANT

Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind

and CALLS to them.

THE GERMAN PRIVATES

Obey.  Hurry after the rest of the

convoy.

IN THE CULVERT

The Americans breathe again.

UPHAM

I wonder where they're going.

MILLER

Same place we are.

MILLER

Scans the Germans with his binoculars.

REIBEN

Looks like tea time, maybe they're

Brits.

UPHAM

I sure hope so.

SARGE

What do you think they're waiting

for, Captain?

MILLER

Puts away the binoculars and jerks

his head for his men to follow, low,

along the wall.  The men are happy

to do so, looking back nervously at

the German tanks.

REIBEN

Looks like they've been having a

hell of a party, here, Captain.

MILLER

ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.

VOICE FROM BRIDGE

KISS MY ASS, FRITZ.

MILLER

YOU FIRE AT US AND I'LL DO A HELL OF

A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

VOICE FROM BRIDGE

WHO WON THE '38 ARMY-NAVY GAME?

MILLER

I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE

COME.

(to his men)

Cover me.

REIBEN

What if our guys open up, sir?

MILLER

You're only allowed to shoot at

Germans, that's one of the rules.

REIBEN

Have it your way, Captain.

MILLER'S MEN

POUR FIRE at the German positions,

SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE.

ON THE BRIDGE

The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM

OF BULLETS at the German positions.

MILLER

I'll keep it in mind.

(calls to Sarge)

OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME.

MILLER

Things are tough all over.  We're

looking for a Private James Ryan.

MILLER

Is he here?

(TO MILLER)

What do you want him for, sir?

MILLER

Jackson, get a hold of command.

MILLER

How many men do you have?

JACKSON

Not yet.

MILLER

Keep trying.

PRIVATE JAMES RYAN

Dashing from cover to cover, making

his way toward them.  Ryan is an

American classic, nineteen years

old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky.

Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and

smeared with dirt and blood, he's

very alive.  His eyes shine, his

face has a spark.  You can't help

but love this kid.

MILLER'S MEN

All watch Ryan run toward them.

JACKSON

So, that's Ryan.

REIBEN

Looks like a flaming asshole to me.

REIBEN

I'm Ryan, sir.  You wanted to see

me?

MILLER

Yes.

THE PARATROOPERS

Are stunned at the news.  They look

at Ryan, there's nothing else they

can do.

MILLER'S MEN

Also look at Ryan, but then, one

after another, they turn away,

adverting their eyes, looking a their

own boots, the debris on the bridge,

the sky, anything other than Ryan.

MILLER

We've been sent to get you out of

here.  You're going home.

MILLER

Sergeant, we're moving out and I'm

taking you and your men with me.

MILLER

I'm giving you new orders, Sergeant.

MILLER

I'm not going to leave you and your

men here to get killed.  Get them

together, we're moving out.

RYAN (O.S.)

No, sir.

MILLER

Come on, Private, you're going home.

RYAN

No, sir.

MILLER

Private.  I'm sorry about your

brothers but staying here and getting

yourself killed isn't going to help.

RYAN

Sir, if the Krauts are holding this

bridge when division shows up, our

guys are going to be sitting ducks.

MILLER

This bridge cannot be held.  The

Germans have two companies less than

three miles from here.  They have

tanks.

MILLER

Private, if you want to commit

suicide, that's your choice, but

you're going to have to wait until

after I get you back to the beach.

And you're not going to take these

men with you.

RYAN

I'm not leaving, sir.

MILLER

The hell you aren't, you're comin'

with me if I have to drag you every

inch of the way.  You hear me,

Private?

RYAN

I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

MILLER

Listen you little son-of-a-bitch

you're coming with me or

I'll...I'll...

RYAN

What are you going to do, sir, shoot

me?

REIBEN

(politely)

Uh, excuse me, Captain.

REIBEN

(continuing)

So, what are a few tanks, sir?

REIBEN

(continuing)

He's right, we can't shoot him...well,

we could but we'd get in an enormous

amount of trouble.  And he's right

about the bridge, it's a hell of a

lot more important than he is.

JACKSON

Cap'n...?

JACKSON

(continuing)

Seems to me, we got us a opportunity,

here, to kill two birds with one

stone.  Command seems to think keepin'

this boy alive is worth somethin'.

If we was to do that and hold this

bridge, good chance we'd get us a

bucket full of medals.  I might even

get me one 'a them big, fancy ones

like you got, so's I could sass any

officer in the whole dang army, you

included.

UPHAM

I'd like to stay, too, Captain.

MILLER

You don't count.

SARGE

I do and personally, I'd rather get

the hell out of here, but somebody's

got to stay and take care of you and

these pin-head privates of yours.

REIBEN

See, Captain?  The vote's unanimous.

REIBEN

Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely

speaking hypothetically.  IF this

was a voting situation, then the

vote would have been unanimous.  But

of course, it's not a voting

situation, you're the captain, and

you give the orders, sir.

MILLER

You're goddamned right, I give the

order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen

to me, you little pissant pieces of

shit, I am the ranking officer here

and what I say goes, is that clear?

JACKSON

Yes, sir.

REIBEN

Of course, sir.

MILLER

In that case...

(beat)

I vote we stay.

MILLER

Reiben, the B.A.R., there.  Jackson,

get up on the bridgekeepers hut with

your sniper rifle.  Sarge, you and

Upham move that machine gun so it

can cover the left flank, it's

worthless where it is.  Forrest, I

want a full inventory of all your

weapons, ammo and ordnance.  Go.

RYAN

Thank you, sir.

MILLER

(gruffly gentle)

Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next

to me, no matter where I go, you

understand?

RYAN

Yes, sir.

MILLER

Alright, come with me.

MILLER

That's it?

REIBEN

Sir, can I change my vote?

A GERMAN SNIPER

Falls from a window on the edge of

town, dead.

UPHAM

Sits beside Jackson with a pair of

binoculars, searching for another

target.  The German sniper fire has

subsided for now.  Ext. bridge - day

Miller watches as Ryan and several

other paratroopers dig a series of

trenches across the street, leading

to the bridge.

MILLER

Sarge, see what you can do to make

those buildings inhospitable.

SARGE

Yes, sir.

UPHAM

Eighty-eights, right?

UPHAM

I can tell what the gunners had for

dinner.

MILLER

Those guns are close.

MILLER

Let's hope they don't change their

mind.

SARGE

What do you think?

MILLER

Well, if we had ten times the men

and a lot more ammo, we might stand

a chance, but not against those tanks.

SARGE

What are we going to do?

MILLER

We're going to hope like hell the

tanks were on their way somewhere

else.

REIBEN

Maybe Caen.

MILLER

Let's hope, because we're sure as

hell not going to do any damage to

them with what we have here.

UPHAM

What about our grenades?

MILLER

Those are Tigers, they have six-inch

armor, they don't even notice

grenades.

UPHAM

Would they notice and eighty-eight?

MILLER

Sure, you got one?

UPHAM

The Germans do.

MILLER

Upham, go find Jackson, he and I are

going hunting.

SARGE

Uh, oh.

MILLER

Out of the mouth of babes.

MILLER

Upham, you've got to learn the

difference between whining and

griping.  You can't just rely on

natural ability, you've got to study

and practice.

UPHAM

But, sir...

MILLER

There you go again, that's whining,

that's not okay.

UPHAM

Goddamn it, sir...

MILLER

That's better, but you've still got

a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben,

he's a natural and works at it, he'll

give you some pointers.

REIBEN

Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have

him pissing and moaning with the

best of us.

MILLER

See to it.

RYAN

I'd like to go, sir.

MILLER

No, private, I want you to stay here,

keep your head down, don't do anything

brave or stupid.

REIBEN

Aren't they the same thing, sir?

MILLER

Reiben, I don't know what I'd do

without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close

to you and alive.

SARGE

Yes, sir.

MILLER

You ready?

JACKSON

You betcha, sir.

REIBEN

(southern accent)

Y'all come back.

JACKSON

Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the

way I talk?

REIBEN

(heavy southern accent)

Hell, no!

IN THE DARKNESS

A slight movement.  It's Miller.  He

crawls to the edge of the emplacement

and freezes in the shadows.

MILLER

Eyes the emplacement.  Looks for a

weakness.  There is none.  He motions

to Forrest and Jackson to wait.  The

three of them settle into the

darkness.

SARGE

Private, I'm sorry about your

brothers.

SARGE

Wade.

RYAN

Wade.  Huh, he died coming up here

to keep me alive...I never met

him...he didn't know me from Adam,

strange.  What was he like?

SARGE

A good man, kind of cheerful, Reiben,

here, used to call him a happy idiot.

REIBEN

Like hell, I did.

RYAN

My brothers would be mighty pissed

off at me, if they knew I let some

guy get killed trying to keep me

alive.

SARGE

You didn't let anybody get killed,

you didn't even know we were coming

up here.

RYAN

Sure, I know, but...

(sighs)

Goddamn it all...

A SHADOW

It's Miller.  Easing through the

darkness.  Closer to one of the

sentries.

BEHIND THE EIGHTY-EIGHT

Forrest removes the wheel-blocks.

A GERMAN SENTRY

Approaches.  He sees Forrest.  Just

as he's about to open up with his

sub-machine gun, Miller grabs him

from behind, STABS him, eases the

body silently to the ground.

MILLER AND JACKSON

Join Forrest at the eighty-eight.

ANOTHER GERMAN SENTRY

Rounds a corner.  Sees them.  OPENS

UP WITH HIS SUB-MACHINE GUN.

OTHER GERMANS

Race over, FIRING.

JACKSON

Covering them, OPENS UP.  Kills the

advancing Germans.

THE WINDSHIELD

Is shattered by bullets.

FORREST

In the back of the truck.

MILLER

RYAN!  GET BACK THERE!

RYAN

Sorry, sir.

MILLER

Don't do that again.

RYAN

I won't need to sir, it's already

here, behind the barricade so...

RYAN

Yes, sir.

REIBEN

What do you think?

JACKSON

I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.

REIBEN

I mean, Ryan, what do you think of

him?

JACKSON

He ain't half-bad, I guess.

REIBEN

I guess.

JACKSON

He ain't Wade.

REIBEN

Nope, he ain't Wade.

MILLER

Crouch-runs through the shadows and

stops at the bridgekeepers hut.

MILLER

Reiben...

REIBEN

Yes, sir.

MILLER

You set?  Sarge nods.

RYAN

Yes, sir.

REIBEN AND UPHAM

Manning the forward machine gun nest.

JACKSON

Behind the sandbags, on top of the

bridgekeeper's hut.

RYAN AND SARGE

Manning rear machine gun.

MILLER

At the bridgehead, waiting.

MILLER

Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down

behind some sandbags.

MILLER

HERE THEY COME!

REIBEN

OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.

THE GERMANS

At least fifty of them, advancing on

the bridge.  Running from cover to

cover.  A squad pushing a French

truck, using it as a shield.

JACKSON

Calmly picking off the attacking

Germans.

THE GERMAN INFANTRYMEN

Make their way down the streets.

Along the riverbank.  Through the

houses.  There are GERMANS FIRING

from all directions.

MILLER

Sees Reiben and Upham being cut off.

Grabs the B.A.R., stands and fires.

REIBEN AND UPHAM

Running out of ammo.  See that there's

nothing else they can do.

REIBEN

Time to go.

RYAN IS FIRING

With the rear MACHINE GUN.  Drops

several Germans.

GERMANS EVERYWHERE

They swarm over the first barricade.

MILLER

FIRES A BURST into a German's belly.

HITS another with the stock of his

Thompson.

HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING

Half a dozen Germans break through.

RYAN

Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES.

KILLS the German.

MILLER

Struggling with a pair of Germans.

JACKSON

FIRES.  Drops one of the Germans on

Miller with a head shot.  Cuts open

Miller's face with bits of skull.

RYAN

Leaps onto the final German attacking

Miller.  That German raises his rifle

on Ryan.

THE STUNNED GERMAN

About to kill Ryan.  Torn apart by

bullets from three directions.

UPHAM

I got him.

REIBEN

Like hell you did, I got him.

JACKSON SMILES

He got him.

MILLER

BACK!  LET'S GO!

SARGE

Sees them in deep trouble.  Leaves

Ryan firing the rear machine gun.

Grabs the B.A.R. ADVANCES, FIRING

COVER.  Exposed.

BULLETS EVERYWHERE

MILLER, REIBEN, UPHAM make it to the

barricade.  Dive over.

SARGE

Sees they've made it.  FIRES A FINAL

BURST.  Races for cover.  A trail of

bullets right behind him.

THE AMERICANS

Desperately trying to cover him.

THE GERMANS

Open up with a volley.

SARGE

Is almost there.

SARGE

Five feet from the sandbags, his

back is TORN APART by Germans fire.

He looks down, stunned at his chest.

Amazed to see GAPING HOLES.  An

instant of surprise, more than fear.

THE GERMANS

Who killed Sarge are killed.  The

others back off for now.

MILLER

Grabs Sarge and pulls him over the

barricade.  Sees that he's dead.

MILLER

Stunned, lays Sarge down, kneeling

next to him.

THE OTHERS

Watch, start to gather.

REIBEN

Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn

it...

MILLER

Get back to your positions!

MILLER

Go!

MILLER

Doesn't move.  He just stares at

Sarge's body.

RYAN

Looks at Miller, sees him growing

weak, starting to sway.  He gently

tries to move Miller aside.

RYAN

I'll take care of Sarge...

MILLER

Sarge?  Who's Sarge?

MILLER

English teacher, Addley, Pennsylvania.

UPHAM

What'd you say, Captain?

MILLER

I teach English at Addley High School

in Addley, Pennsylvania.

REIBEN

Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.

JACKSON

Like hell, you did.

UPHAM

Captain, what about our deal?

MILLER

I changed my mind.

REIBEN

What deal?

MILLER

I coach the baseball team, too.

JACKSON

No kiddin'?

REIBEN

What deal?

UPHAM

Forget it.

MILLER

You know that cruise ship Wade's

grandfather was on?

MILLER

(continuing)

I wonder if his cabin is still

available?

REIBEN

That's not where I am.  Miller No?

Where are you?

REIBEN

I'm in a dressing room with Mrs.

Rachel Troubowitz, our super's wife.

She's an easy forty-four, double E,

but I've convinced her she's a thirty-

eight D and I'm watching her try and

squeeze herself into a side-stay,

silk-ribboned, three-panel girdle

with s Helf-lift brassiere.

(smiles)

She's having a devil of a time,

getting into that thing.

JACKSON

Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy,

it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and

we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a

flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...

REIBEN

Jackson, how many times I got to

tell you, you're from Tennessee.

JACKSON

I am, but I like imported whiskey.

So there I am and I hear the biggest

ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a

rustlin' right there in front of me.

That ole' boy comes right out of the

brush, I got a clear shot and he

knows he's 'bout to meet his maker.

I aim, I got my finger tight on the

trigger and then I just smile and

say to that ole' coon, go on, now,

you get out 'a here.  Then I sit

down on a hollow log and take me a

right long pull a' that mash whiskey.

UPHAM

I don't know, I kind of like Wade's

idea about the cruise ship.  I've

never been to Tahiti.

REIBEN

What about you, Captain?

MILLER

I'm in my backyard, lying in my

hammock, with my arm around my wife,

listening for the sound of breaking

glass.

JACKSON

Say what, Cap'n?

MILLER

You see, I've got the best house in

all of Addley.  It's not the biggest

house, but it's got the best location,

right next to the junior high baseball

field.  The garage windows face left

field.  The guy who owned the house

before me had these heavy screen S

put over them.  The first thing I

did when I bought the place was take

off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty-

two yards from home plate to my garage

windows.  It takes a hell of a junior

high kid to hit a ball that far.  I

look at my garage windows as a

Motivator and a way to scout the

kids coming up, the ones who are

going to give us a shot at the state

championship.  I lay there in my

hammock and every time I hear the

sound of breaking glass, I know we're

one step closer to winning it all.

JACKSON

Don't that get kind of expensive,

Cap'n?

MILLER

It's worth it.

JACKSON

To each, his own.

MILLER

How about you, James?

RYAN

I'm home, playing basketball with my

brothers, it's evenin' time, we're

trying' to get in a few more points

before it's too dark to see the ball.

That's where I am.

MILLER

Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF

THE TANK.  Barely has time to react.

Sees:

MILLER

Here they come.

REIBEN

FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.

MILLER

FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.

MILLER

Manning the forward machine gun.

Way out front.  Sees that he's going

to be cut off.  He grabs the hot

gun.  The barrel burns into his flesh.

He ignores the pain and RUNS BACK

toward the bridge.

THE GERMANS

Take positions near the bridge.

Moving in.  FIRING.  Overwhelming.

They're everywhere.

THREE GERMANS

Break through the perimeter.

REIBEN

Sees Ryan.  Races over.  SHOOTS one

German.  STABS the other.

MILLER

FIRES again.  More Germans drop.

THE GERMANS

Take positions in the building near

the bridge.

REIBEN AND RYAN

Forward.  Reiben FIRING.  Ryan feeding

the ammo belt.

REIBEN

MORE AMMO!

UPHAM

Hears that.  Doesn't hesitate.  He

grabs a pair of ammo boxes.  RUNS

toward Reiben and Ryan.

UPHAM

TAKES HALF-A-DOZEN SLUGS.  Torn apart.

Stumbles the final few steps to the

machine gun nest.  Falls on the

sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the

ammo.  UPHAM'S DEAD.

REIBEN

Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the

advancing Germans.

MILLER

Knows what that means.  He hears the

RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.

MILLER

TIGHTEN IT UP!  HERE THEY COME!

RYAN AND REIBEN

Immediately grab the machine gun and

ammo and race back to the rear nest.

JACKSON

On the bridgekeeper's hut.  Picking

off German soldiers who follow the

tank.

THE TANK

Stops.  Grinds its gears.  Turning

it's turret towards the bridgekeepers

hut.

MILLER

JACKSON!

JACKSON

Knows what's coming but he holds his

position, continuing to pick off

German soldiers.

THE TANK BLASTS

THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT AND JACKSON

ARE OBLITERATED IN THE EXPLOSION.

MILLER AND RYAN

SEE JACKSON DIE.  A bare moment to

react.  Then, they turn their

attention back to the eighty-eight.

Frantically turning the aiming cranks.

Lowering the barrel to point blank.

MILLER AND RYAN

Win the race.

FIRE THE EIGHTY-EIGHT

BLAST THE LEAD TANK DESTROY IT IN A

SHOWER OF METAL AND FLAMES

MILLER AND RYAN

Quickly reload the eighty-eight.

FIRE AGAIN.

MILLER

Shoves the FINAL SHELL into the breech

of the eighty-eight.  Pats Ryan on

the back.  Grabs a SATCHEL CHARGE.

RYAN

FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.

MILLER

Races through the debris.  Trailed

by BULLETS.

REIBEN

With the machine gun.  Covers Miller.

Keeping most of the German infantry

down.

MILLER

Is almost there.  He arms the satchel

charge.

MILLER

Throws the satchel charge under the

tank.  Rolls off the edge of the

bridge.  Lands on the embankment

below.

MILLER

HOLD IT!  HOLD IT!

MILLER

Goddamn it!

REIBEN

More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them

The fear on their faces turns to

resignation.  They know that they

are dead men.  They settle into their

positions, and prepare to fire and

die.

THE ADVANCING TROOPS

Run onto the bridge and start to

secure the position.  A SERGEANT and

a few of HIS MEN look around,

curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and

Ryan, battered and bloody, standing

among the bodies.

MILLER

Miller, Company B, Second Rangers,

that's Private Richard Reiben and

that's Private James Ryan, Hundred-

and-First Airborne.

SERGEANT

Ryan?

MILLER

Walks to the bodies.  He kneels down

next to Sarge and looks at him for a

long moment.  Then, with a steady

hand, he takes one of Sarge's two

dog-tags.  Then he does the same to

Jackson and Upham.

MILLER

Stands and walks back to Reiben and

Ryan.  He hands the dog-tags to Ryan

who grips them tightly and nods in

thanks.

CAMERA CRANES UP

The three dirty, bloodied, tired men

walk down the road, ignored by the

fresh troops marching in the opposite

direction.

RYAN

Captain?

MILLER

Yes, Private.

RYAN

Upham and Jackson, what were they

like?

MILLER

Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was

writing a book.

RYAN

Yeah?

REIBEN

Yeah, and he was fast, too, ran the

220 in twenty-four-five.

RYAN

No kidding.

MILLER

Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee,

he was going to be a preacher, his

father and uncles have a traveling

ministry out of the back of a stretch

Hudson.

RYAN

And Sarge?

MILLER

Sarge?

(beat)

He was the best friend I ever had.

(smiles)

Lemme tell you about Sarge...
