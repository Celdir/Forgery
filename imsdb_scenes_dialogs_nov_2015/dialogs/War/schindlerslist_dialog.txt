SCHINDLER'S LIST

"SCHINDLER'S LIST"

BY

Steven Zaillian

Final Draft

CLERKS (V.O.)

...Rossen... Lieberman... Wachsberg...

CLERKS (V.O.)

...When your name is called go over

there... take this over to that

table...

CLERKS (V.O.)

...youre in the wrong line, wait

over there... you, come over here...

CLERKS (V.O.)

...Biberman... Steinberg...

Chilowitz...

WAITER

From the gentleman.

LIEUTENANT

Do I know him?

LIEUTENANT

Find out who he is.

LIEUTENANT

Stay here.

LIEUTENANT

Let me get this one.

SCHINDLER

No, put it away, put it away.

SCHINDLER

What are you drinking, gin?

SS OFFICER 1

Who is that?

SS OFFICER 2

(like everyone knows)

That's Oskar Schindler. He's an old

friend of... I don't know, somebody's.

CLERKS

Groder... Gemeinerowa... Libeskind...

SCHINDLER

Stern?

SCHINDLER

Are you Itzhak Stern?

STERN

I am.

SCHINDLER

There's a company you did the books

for on Lipowa Street, made what,

pots and pans?

STERN

(pause)

By law, I have to tell you, sir, I'm

a Jew.

SCHINDLER

All right, you've done it -- good

company, you think?

STERN

It did all right.

SCHINDLER

I don't know anything about

enamelware, do you?

STERN

I was just the accountant.

SCHINDLER

Simple engineering, though, wouldn't

you think? Change the machines around,

whatever you do, you could make other

things, couldn't you?

SCHINDLER

Field kits, mess kits...

SCHINDLER

Army contracts.

SCHINDLER

Once the war ends, forget it, but

for now it's great, you could make a

fortune. Don't you think?

STERN

(with an edge)

I think most people right now have

other priorities.

SCHINDLER

Like what?

STERN

Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll

do very well. In fact the worse things

get the better you'll do. It was a

"pleasure."

SCHINDLER

The contracts? That's the easy part.

Finding the money to buy the company,

that's hard.

SCHINDLER

You know anybody?

SCHINDLER

Jews, yeah. Investors.

STERN

(pause)

Jews can no longer own businesses,

sir, that's why this one's for sale.

SCHINDLER

Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own

it. I'd pay them back in product.

They can trade it on the black market,

do whatever they want, everybody's

happy.

STERN

Pots and pans.

SCHINDLER

(nodding)

Something they can hold in their

hands.

STERN

I don't know anybody who'd be

interested in that.

SCHINDLER

(a slow knowing nod)

They should be.

GOLDBERG

What's that?

PFEFFERBERG

You don't recognize it? Maybe that's

because it's not what I asked for.

GOLDBERG

You asked for shoe polish.

PFEFFERBERG

My buyers sold it to a guy who sold

it to the Army. But by the time it

got there -- because of the cold --

it broke, the whole truckload.

GOLDBERG

(pause)

So I'm responsible for the weather?

PFEFFERBERG

I asked for metal, you gave me glass.

GOLDBERG

This is not my problem.

PFEFFERBERG

Look it up.

PFEFFERBERG

This is not your problem? Everybody

wants to know who I got it from, and

I'm going to tell them.

GOLDBERG

Metal.

PFEFFERBERG

Let's say this is what you give me.

These are fees I have to pay some

guys. This is my commission. This is

what I bring you back in Occupation

currency.

PFEFFERBERG

That's a nice shirt.

SCHINDLER

You don't know where I could find a

shirt like that.

PFEFFERBERG

Like this?

SCHINDLER

(nodding)

There's nothing in the stores.

PFEFFERBERG

You have any idea what a shirt like

this costs?

SCHINDLER

Nice things cost money.

PFEFFERBERG

How many?

SCHINDLER

I don't know, ten or twelve. That's

a good color. Dark blues, grays.

PFEFFERBERG

Write down your measurements.

SCHINDLER

I'm going to need some other things.

As things come up.

CZURDA

The SS doesn't own the trains,

somebody's got to pay. Whether it's

a passenger car or a livestock car,

it doesn't matter -- which, by the

way, you have to see. You have to

set aside an afternoon, go down to

the station and see this.

CZURDA

So you got thousands of fares that

have to be paid. Since it's the SS

that's reserved the trains, logically

they should pay. But this is a lot

of money.

(pause)

The Jews. They're the ones riding

the trains, they should pay. So you

got Jews paying their own fares to

ride on cattle cars to God knows

where. They pay the SS full fare,

the SS turns around, pays the railroad

a reduced excursion fare, and pockets

the difference.

SCHINDLER

(to Ingrid)

Excuse me.

SCHINDLER

There's nothing more sacred than

marriage. No happier an occasion

than one's wedding day. I wish you

all the best.

OWNER

I go to the bank, I go in, they tell

me my account's been placed in Trust.

In Trust? What are they talking about,

whose Trust? The Germans'. I look

around. Now I see that everybody's

arguing, they can't get to their

money either.

MAX REDLICHT

This is true?

OWNER

I'll take you there.

MAX REDLICHT

Let me understand. The Nazis have

taken your money. So because they've

done this to you, you expect me to

go unpaid. That's what you're saying.

MAX REDLICHT

That makes sense to you?

EINSATZ NCO

I want you to spit on it. I want you

to walk past, spit on it, and stand

over there.

MAX REDLICHT

I haven't been to temple must be

fifty years.

(to the rabbi)

Nor have I been invited.

MAX REDLICHT

(to the rabbi)

You don't approve of the way I make

my living? I'm a bad man, I do bad

things?

MAX REDLICHT

I've done some things... but I won't

do this.

EINSATZ NCO

What does this mean? Of all of you,

there's only one who has the guts to

say no? One? And he doesn't even

believe?

(no one, of course

answer him)

I come in here, I ask you to do

something no one should ever ask.

And you do it?

(pause)

What won't you do?

EINSATZ NCO

You, sir, I respect.

EINSATZ NCO

The rest of you... ...are beneath

his contempt.

POLISH GIRL

Goodbye, Jews.

PFEFFERBERG

What's this?

GOLDBERG

Ghetto Police. I'm a policeman now,

can you believe it?

PFEFFERBERG

Yeah, I can.

SCHINDLER

For each thousand you invest, you

take from the loading dock five

hundred kilos of product a month --

to begin in July and to continue for

one year -- after which time, we're

even.

(he shrugs)

That's it.

INVESTOR 1

Not good enough.

SCHINDLER

Not good enough? Look where you're

living. Look where you've been put.

"Not good enough."

(he almost laughs at

the squalor)

A couple of months ago, you'd be

right. Not anymore.

INVESTOR 1

Money's still money.

SCHINDLER

No, it isn't, that's why we're here.

SCHINDLER

Did I call this meeting? You told

Mr. Stern you wanted to speak to me.

I'm here. Now you want to negotiate?

The offer's withdrawn.

INVESTOR 2

How do we know you'll do what you

say?

SCHINDLER

Because I said I would. What do you

want, a contract? To be filed where?

(he slips into his

coat)

I said what I'll do, that's our

contract.

STERN

The standard SS rate for Jewish

skilled labor is seven Marks a day,

five for unskilled and women. This

is what you pay the Economic Office,

the laborers themselves receive

nothing. Poles you pay wages.

Generally, they get a little more.

Are you listening?

SCHINDLER

What was that about the SS, the rate,

the... ?

STERN

The Jewish worker's salary, you pay

it directly to the SS, not to the

worker. He gets nothing.

SCHINDLER

But it's less. It's less than what I

would pay a Pole. That's the point

I'm trying to make. Poles cost more.

SCHINDLER

Why should I hire Poles?

TEACHER

I'm a teacher.

CLERK

Not essential work, stand over there.

TEACHER

I'm a metal polisher.

CLERK

Good.

SCHERNER

I'd never ask you for money, you

know that. I don't even like talking

about it -- money, favors -- I find

it very awkward, it makes me very

uncomfortable --

SCHINDLER

No, look. It's the others. They're

the ones causing these delays.

SCHERNER

What others?

SCHINDLER

Whoever. They're the ones. They'd

appreciate some kind of gesture from

me.

SCHINDLER

I should send it to you, though,

don't you think? You can forward it

on? I'd be grateful.

SCHERNER

That'd be fine.

SCHINDLER

Done. Let's not talk about it anymore,

let's have a good time.

SCHINDLER

Sit down.

SCHINDLER

Oh, come on.

SCHINDLER

My father was fond of saying you

need three things in life. A good

doctor, a forgiving priest and a

clever accountant. The first two...

SCHINDLER

(long sufferingly)

Just pretend for Christ's sake.

SCHINDLER

Thank you.

KLONOWSKA

Yes?

SCHINDLER (O.S.)

Who is it?

SCHINDLER

She's so embarrassed -- look at her --

SCHINDLER

You know what, you'd like her.

EMILIE

Oskar, please --

SCHINDLER

What --

EMILIE

I don't have to like her just because

you do. It doesn't work that way.

SCHINDLER

You would, though. That's what I'm

saying.

KLONOWSKA

Goodbye. It was a pleasure meeting

you.

EMILIE

You've done well here.

SCHINDLER

You look great.

DOORMAN

Careful of the pavement --

SCHINDLER

-- Mrs. Schindler.

SCHINDLER

Mrs. Schindler.

EMILIE

It's not a charade, all this?

SCHINDLER

A charade? How could it be a charade?

SCHINDLER

There's no way I could have known

this before, but there was always

something missing. In every business

I tried, I see now it wasn't me that

was failing, it was this thing, this

missing thing. Even if I'd known

what it was, there's nothing I could

have done about it, because you can't

create this sort of thing. And it

makes all the difference in the world

between success and failure.

EMILIE

Luck.

SCHINDLER

War.

SCHINDLER

What?

EMILIE

I feel like an old-fashioned couple.

It feels good.

EMILIE

Should I stay?

SCHINDLER

(pause)

It's a beautiful city.

EMILIE

Should I stay?

SCHINDLER

(pause)

It's up to you.

EMILIE

No, it's up to you.

EMILIE

Promise me no doorman or maitre 'd

will presume I am anyone other than

Mrs. Schindler... and I'll stay.

CLERKS

Your luggage will follow you. Make

sure it's clearly labeled. Leave

your luggage on the platform.

FOREMAN

Every other time it's been all right.

This time when I weigh the truck, I

see he's heavy, he's loaded too much.

I point this out to him, I tell him

to wait, he tells me he's got a new

arrangement with Mr. Schindler --

(to Schindler)

-- that you know all about it and

it's okay with you.

SCHINDLER

It's "okay" with me?

STERN

How heavy was he?

FOREMAN

Not that much, just too much for it

to be a mistake -- 200 kilos.

SCHINDLER

(pause)

You're sure.

WOMAN AT DESK

Can I help you?

SCHINDLER

If you or anyone acting as an agent

for you comes to my factory again,

I'll have you arrested.

INVESTOR

It was a mistake.

SCHINDLER

It was a mistake? What was a mistake?

How do you know what I'm talking

about?

INVESTOR

All right, it wasn't a mistake, but

it was one time.

SCHINDLER

We had a deal, you broke it. One

phone call and your whole family is

dead.

INVESTOR

I gave you money.

SCHINDLER

How you feeling, all right?

PFEFFERBERG

Yeah.

SCHINDLER

What's the matter, everything all

right at home?

(Pfefferberg nods)

Mila's okay?

PFEFFERBERG

She's good.

SCHINDLER

Good.

SCHINDLER

I could try to read this or I could

eat my lunch while it's till hot.

We're doing well?

STERN

Yes.

SCHINDLER

Better this month than last?

STERN

Yes.

SCHINDLER

Any reason to think next month will

be worse?

STERN

The war could end.

SCHINDLER

(impatient)

What?

STERN

(pause)

There's a machinist outside who'd

like to thank you personally for

giving him a job.

STERN

He asks every day. It'll just take a

minute. He's very grateful.

STERN

Mr. Lowenstein?

LOWENSTEIN

I want to thank you, sir, for giving

me the opportunity to work.

SCHINDLER

You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing

a great job.

LOWENSTEIN

The SS beat me up. They would have

killed me, but I'm essential to the

war effort, thanks to you.

SCHINDLER

That's great.

LOWENSTEIN

I work hard for you. I'll continue

to work hard for you.

SCHINDLER

That's great, thanks.

LOWENSTEIN

God bless you, sir.

SCHINDLER

Yeah, okay.

LOWENSTEIN

You're a good man.

STERN

Okay, Mr. Lowenstein.

LOWENSTEIN

He saved my life.

STERN

Yes, he did.

LOWENSTEIN

God bless him.

STERN

Yes.

SCHINDLER

Don't ever do that to me again.

STERN

Do what?

SCHINDLER

Close the door.

TOFFEL

It's got nothing to do with reality,

Oskar, I know it and you know it,

it's a matter of national priority

to these guys. It's got a ritual

significance to them, Jews shoveling

snow.

SCHINDLER

I lost a day of production. I lost a

worker. I expect to be compensated.

TOFFEL

File a grievance with the Economic

Office, it's your right.

SCHINDLER

Would it do any good?

TOFFEL

No.

TOFFEL

I think you're going to have to put

up with a lot of snow shoveling yet.

TOFFEL

A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

SCHINDLER

(right back)

He was a metal press operator, quite

skilled.

SCHINDLER

Unlike your radiators -- and your

boxes -- my products aren't for sale

on the open market. This company has

only one client, the German Army.

And lately I've been having trouble

fulfilling my obligations to my

client. With your help, I hope the

problem can be solved. The problem,

simply, is space.

SCHINDLER

I'd like you to consider a proposal

which I think you'll find equitable.

I'd like you to think about it and

get back to me as soon as --

KUHNPAST

Excuse me -- do you really think

this is appropriate?

KUHNPAST

I can appreciate your problem. If I

had any space I could lease you, I

would. I don't. I'm sorry.

HOHNE

Me neither, sorry.

SCHINDLER

I don't want to lease your facilities,

I want to buy them. I'm prepared to

offer you fair market value. And to

let you stay on, if you want, as

supervisors.

(pause)

On salary.

KUHNPAST

You've got to be kidding.

KUHNPAST

(pause)

Thanks for the drink.

SCHINDLER

You try to be fair to people, they

walk out the door; I've never

understood that. What's next?

STERN

Christmas presents.

SCHINDLER

Ah, yes.

SCHERNER

Oskar...

SCHINDLER

All right.

GESTAPO (O.S.)

Oskar Schindler?

GESTAPO

We have a warrant to take your

company's business records with us.

And another to take you.

SCHINDLER

Am I permitted to have my secretary

cancel my appointments for the day?

GESTAPO CLERK

You live very well.

GESTAPO CLERK

This standard of living comes entirely

from legitimate sources, I take it?

GESTAPO CLERK

As an SS supplier, you have a moral

obligation to desist from blackmarket

dealings. You're in business to

support the war effort, not to fatten --

SCHINDLER

(interrupting)

You know? When my friends ask, I'd

love to be able to tell them you

treated me with the utmost courtesy

and respect.

SCHINDLER

Chances of getting a bottle of vodka

pretty good?

WAFFEN GUARD

Yes, sir.

SCHINDLER

Wait a minute.

SCHINDLER

Pajamas.

GUARD

I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

Whenever you're ready, you're free

to leave.

GESTAPO CLERK

I'd advise you not to get too

comfortable. Sooner or later, law

prevails. No matter who your friends

are.

SCHINDLER

You expect me to walk home, or what?

GESTAPO CLERK

(tightly)

Bring a car around for Mr. Schindler.

SCHINDLER

If you'd return the ledgers to my

office I'd appreciate it.

SCHINDLER

Excuse me -- hey --

(the guy turns)

They're working.

SCHINDLER (O.S.)

He's essential. Without him,

everything comes to a grinding halt.

If that happens --

CLERK

Itzhak Stern?

(Schindler nods)

He's on the list.

SCHINDLER

He is.

SCHINDLER

Well, let's find him.

CLERK

He's on the list. If he were an

essential worker, he would not be on

the list. He's on the list. You can't

have him.

SCHINDLER

I'm talking to a clerk.

SCHINDLER

What's your name?

CLERK

Sir, the list is correct.

SCHINDLER

I didn't ask you about the list, I

asked you your name.

CLERK

Klaus Tauber.

CLERK

The gentleman thinks a mistake's

been made.

SCHINDLER

My plant manager is somewhere on

this train. If it leaves with him on

it, it'll disrupt production and the

Armaments Board will want to know

why.

SERGEANT

(to the clerk)

Is he on the list?

CLERK

Yes, sir.

SERGEANT

(to Schindler)

The list is correct, sir. There's

nothing I can do.

SCHINDLER

May as well get your name while you're

here.

SERGEANT

My name? My name is Kunder. Sergeant

Kunder. What's yours?

SCHINDLER

Schindler.

SCHINDLER

Sergeant, Mr. Tauber, thank you very

much. I think I can guarantee you

you'll both be in Southern Russia

before the end of the month. Good

evening.

CLERK & SERGEANT

Stern! Itzhak Stern!

SCHINDLER

There he is.

SERGEANT

Open it.

CLERK

Initial it, please.

(Schindler initials

the change)

And this...

CLERK

It makes no difference to us, you

understand -- this one, that one.

It's the inconvenience to the list.

It's the paperwork.

STERN

I somehow left my work card at home.

I tried to tell them it was a mistake,

but they --

STERN

I'm sorry. It was stupid.

(contrite)

Thank you.

GOETH

Make a nice driveway.

KNUDE

This street divides the ghetto just

about in half. On the right -- Ghetto

A: civil employees, industry workers,

so on. On the left, Ghetto B: surplus

labor, the elderly mostly. Which is

where you'll probably want to start.

KNUDE

Of course that's entirely up to you.

HUJAR

She says the foundation was poured

wrong, she's got to take it down. I

told her it's a barracks, not a

fucking hotel, fucking Jew engineer.

ENGINEER

The entire foundation has to be dug

up and re-poured. If it isn't, the

thing will collapse before it's even

completed.

GOETH

(calmly)

Shoot her.

GOETH

You argued with my man.

(to Hujar)

Shoot her.

HUJAR

Sir...

GOETH

I'm sure you're right.

GOETH

That's somebody who knew what they

were doing. That's somebody I needed.

(pause)

Take it down, re-pour it, rebuild

it, like she said.

GOETH

Today is history. The young will ask

with wonder about this day. Today is

history and you are a part of it.

GOETH (V.O.)

When, elsewhere, they were footing

the blame for the Black Death,

Kazimierz the Great, so called, told

the Jews they could come to Cracow.

They came.

GOETH (V.O.)

They trundled their belongings into

this city, they settled, they took

hold, they prospered.

GOETH

For six centuries, there has been a

Jewish Cracow.

GOETH

By this weekend, those six centuries,

they're a rumor. They never happened.

Today is history.

MAJOLA

(mutters)

Amon... Christ...

HUJAR

Your machinery will be moved and

installed by the SS at no cost to

you. You will pay no rent, no

maintenance --

SCHINDLER

No, no, come on, sit --

SCHINDLER

How you doing?

GOETH

We started without you.

SCHINDLER

Good.

SCHINDLER

Please.

SCHINDLER

I miss anything important?

HUJAR

I was explaining to Mr. Bosch and

Mr. Madritsch some of the benefits

of moving their factories into

Plaszow.

SCHINDLER

Oh, good, yeah.

HUJAR

Since your labor is housed on-site,

it's available to you at all times.

You can work them all night if you

want. Your factory policies, whatever

they've been in the past, they'll

continue to be, they'll be respected --

SCHINDLER

I'm sorry.

GOETH

You know, they told me you were going

to be trouble -- Czurda and Scherner.

SCHINDLER

You're kidding.

GOETH

He looks great, though, doesn't he?

I have to know -- where do you get a

suit like that? what is that, silk?

(Schindler nods)

It's great.

SCHINDLER

I'd say I'd get you one but the guy

who made it, he's probably dead, I

don't know.

GOETH

Something wonderful's happened, do

you know what it is? Without planning

it, we've reached that happy point

in our careers where duty and

financial opportunity meet.

SCHINDLER

I go to work the other day, there's

nobody there. Nobody tells me about

this, I have to find out, I have to

go in, everybody's gone --

GOETH

They're not gone, they're here.

SCHINDLER

They're mine!

SCHINDLER

Every day that goes by, I'm losing

money. Every worker that is shot,

costs me money -- I have to get

somebody else, I have to train them --

GOETH

We're going to be making so much

money, none of this is going to matter --

SCHINDLER

(cutting him off)

It's bad business.

GOETH

(shrugs)

Some of the boys went crazy, what're

you going to do? You're right, it's

bad business, but it's over with,

it's done.

(pause)

Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to

make an example. But that's good

business.

GOETH

Scherner told me something else about

you.

SCHINDLER

Yeah, what's that?

GOETH

That you know the meaning of the

word gratitude. That it's not some

vague thing with you like with some

guys.

SCHINDLER

True.

GOETH

You want to stay where you are. You

got things going on the side, things

are good, you don't want anybody

telling you what to do -- I can

understand all that.

(pause)

What you want is your own sub-camp.

GOETH

Do you have any idea what's involved?

The paperwork alone? Forget you got

to build it all, getting the fucking

permits, that's enough to drive you

crazy. Then the engineers show up.

They stand around and they argue

about drainage -- I'm telling you,

you'll want to shoot somebody, I've

been through it, I know.

SCHINDLER

Well, you've been through it. You

know. You could make things easier

for me.

SCHINDLER

I'd be grateful.

SS OFFICER

You have the Poles beat the Czechs,

you have the Czechs beat the Poles,

that way everybody stays in line.

SCHINDLER

All I have is Jews.

LEO JOHN

-- she's seventy years old, she's

been there forever -- they bomb her

house. Everything's gone. The

furniture, everything.

SCHINDLER

(well aware the man

is lying)

Thank God she wasn't there.

LEO JOHN

I was thinking maybe you could help

her out. Some plates and mugs, some

stew pots, I don't know. Say half a

gross of everything?

SCHINDLER

She run an orphanage, your aunt?

LEO JOHN

She's old. What she can't use maybe

she can sell.

SCHINDLER

You want it sent directly to her or

through you?

LEO JOHN

Through me, I think. I'd like to

enclose a card.

LEO JOHN

Your wife must be a saint.

SCHINDLER

She is.

GOETH'S GIRL

You're not a soldier?

SCHINDLER

No, dear.

CZURDA

There's a picture. Private Schindler?

Blanket around his shoulders over in

Kharkov?

GOETH

Happened to what's his name -- up in

Warsaw -- and he was bigger than

you, Oskar.

CZURDA

Toebbens.

GOETH

Happened to Toebbens. Almost. Himmler

goes up to Warsaw, tells the armament

guys, "Get the fucking Jews out of

Toebbens' factory and put Toebbens

in the army," and -- "and sent him

to the Front." I mean, the Front.

GOETH

It's true. Never happen in Cracow,

though, we all love you too much.

SCHINDLER

I pay you too much.

SCHINDLER

You held back Stern. You held back

the one man most important to my

business.

GOETH

He's important to my business.

SCHINDLER

What do you want for him, I'll give

it to you.

GOETH

I want him.

(turning back)

Come on, let's go inside, let's have

a good time.

SCHINDLER

Here.

SCHINDLER

This, I don't know, maybe you can

trade it for something.

STERN

Thank you.

SCHINDLER

I got to go, I'll see you.

STERN

Oskar --

STERN

There's a guy. This thing happened.

Goeth came into the metalworks --

CUT TO:

GOETH

What are you making?

LEVARTOV

Hinges, sir.

GOETH

I got some workers coming in

tomorrow... Where the hell they from

again?

GOLDBERG

Yugoslavia.

GOETH

Yugoslavia. I got to make room.

GOETH

Make me a hinge.

GOETH

Another.

GOETH

That's very good. What I don't

understand, though, is -- you've

been working since what, about six

this morning? Yet such a small pile

of hinges?

GOETH

(mumble)

Christ --

GOETH

God damn it --

CUT BACK TO:

SCHINDLER

The guy can turn out a hinge in less

than a minute? Why the long story?

LEVARTOV

Thank you, sir.

SCHINDLER

Oh, yeah. You're welcome.

GOETH

Nobody knows who stole the chicken.

A man walks around with a chicken,

nobody notices this.

GOETH

Still nobody knows.

GOETH

There we go.

GOETH

It was you? You committed this crime?

BOY

No, sir.

GOETH

You know who, though.

BOY

Him!

SCHINDLER

Yeah, sure, bring him over.

BOY

Thank you, sir.

SCHINDLER

(distracted)

That's okay.

MECHANIC

Thank --

SCHINDLER

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

GUARD

He won't see you.

SCHINDLER

Miss Krause.

MISS KRAUSE

How do you do?

SCHINDLER

Pernod? Cognac?

MISS KRAUSE

No, thank you.

SCHINDLER

So.

MISS KRAUSE

They say that no one dies here. They

say your factory is a haven. They

say you are good.

SCHINDLER

Who says that?

MISS KRAUSE

Everyone.

MISS KRAUSE

My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa

Krause. I've been living in Cracow

on false papers since the ghetto

massacre.

(pause)

My parents are in Plaszow. They're

old. They're killing old people in

Plaszow now. They bury them up in

the forest. I have no money. I

borrowed these clothes. Will you

bring them here?

SCHINDLER

I don't do that. You've been misled.

I ask one thing: whether or not a

worker has certain skills. That's

what I ask and that's what I care

about, get out of my office.

SCHINDLER

Cry and I'll have you arrested, I

swear to God.

SCHINDLER

People die, it's a fact of life.

SCHINDLER

He wants to kill everybody? Great.

What am I supposed to do, bring

everybody over? Is that what you

think? Yeah, send them over to

Schindler, send them all. His place

is a "haven," didn't you know? It's

not a factory, it's not an enterprise

of any kind, it's a haven for people

with no skills whatsoever.

SCHINDLER

You think I don't know what you're

doing? You're so quiet all the time?

I know.

STERN

(with concern)

Are you losing money?

SCHINDLER

No, I'm not losing money, that's not

the point.

STERN

What other point is --

SCHINDLER

(interrupts; yells)

It's dangerous. It's dangerous, to

me, personally.

SCHINDLER

You have to understand, Goeth's under

enormous pressure. You have to think

of it in his situation. He's got

this whole place to run, he's

responsible for everything that goes

on here, all these people -- he's

got a lot of things to worry about.

And he's got the war. Which brings

out the worst in people. Never the

good, always the bad. Always the

bad. But in normal circumstances, he

wouldn't be like this. He'd be all

right. There'd be just the good

aspects of him. Which is a wonderful

crook. A guy who loves good food,

good wine, the ladies, making money...

STERN

And killing.

SCHINDLER

I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't

think he enjoys it.

(pause)

All right, he does enjoy it, so what?

What do you expect me to do about

it?

STERN

There's nothing you can do. I'm not

asking you to do anything. You came

into my office.

SCHINDLER

Perlman, husband and wife.

SCHINDLER

Give it to Goldberg, have him send

them over.

SCHINDLER

They don't fear us because we have

the power to kill, they fear us

because we have the power to kill

arbitrarily. A man commits a crime,

he should know better. We have him

killed, we feel pretty good about

it. Or we kill him ourselves and we

feel even better. That's not power,

though, that's justice. That's

different than power. Power is when

we have every justification to kill --

and we don't. That's power. That's

what the emperors had. A man stole

something, he's brought in before

the emperor, he throws himself down

on the floor, he begs for mercy, he

knows he's going to die... and the

emperor pardons him. This worthless

man. He lets him go. That's power.

That's power.

SCHINDLER

Amon the Good.

STABLE BOY

I'm sorry, sir, I'm almost done.

GOETH

Oh, that's all right.

WORKER

I have to report, sir, I've been

unable to remove the stains from

your bathtub.

GOETH

What are you using?

WORKER

Soap, sir.

GOETH

(incredulous)

Soap? Not lye?

GOETH

Go ahead, go on, leave. I pardon

you.

STERN

If he didn't steal so much, I could

hide it. If he's steal with some

discretion...

CUT TO:

STERN

There are fifteen thousand people

here --

GOLDBERG

Goeth says there's twenty-five.

STERN

There are fifteen. He wants to say

sixteen, seventeen, all right, maybe

he can get away with it, but ten

thousand over? It's stupid.

GOLDBERG

Stern, do me a favor, get out of

here. You want to argue about it, go

tell Goeth.

STERN (V.O.)

The SS auditors keep coming around,

looking over the books -- Goeth knows

this --

STERN (V.O.)

-- you'd think he'd have the common

sense to see what's coming. No, he

steals with complete impunity.

CUT BACK TO:

SCHINDLER

So you'll be rid of him.

STERN

If Plaszow is closed, they'll have

to send us somewhere else. Where --

who knows? Gross-Rosen maybe. Maybe

Auschwitz.

SCHINDLER

I'll talk to him.

STERN

I think it's too late.

SCHINDLER

Well, I'll talk to somebody. I'll

take care of it.

SCHINDLER

What's he done that's so bad -- take

money? That's a crime? Come on, what

are we here for, to fight a war?

We're here to make money, all of us.

TOFFEL

There's taking money and there's

taking money, you know that. He's

taking money.

SCHERNER

The place produces nothing. I

shouldn't say that -- nothing it

produces reaches the Army. That's

not all right.

SCHINDLER

So I'll talk to him about it.

SCHERNER

He's a friend of yours, you want to

help him out. Tell me this, though --

has he ever once shown you his

appreciation? I've yet to see it.

Never a courtesy. Never a thank you

note. He forgets my wife at Christmas

time --

SCHINDLER

He's got no style, we all know that.

So, we should hang him for it?

TOFFEL

He's stealing from you, Oskar.

SCHINDLER

Of course he's stealing from me,

we're in business together. What is

this? I'm sitting here, suddenly

everybody's talking like this is

something bad. We take from each

other, we take from the Army,

everybody uses everybody, it works

out, everybody's happy.

SCHERNER

Not like him.

SCHINDLER

Yeah, well, in some eyes it doesn't

matter the amount we steal, it's

that we do it. Each of us sitting at

this table.

SCHERNER

He doesn't deserve your loyalty.

More important, he's not worth you

making threats against us.

SCHINDLER

Did I threaten anybody here? I stated

a simple fact.

SCHINDLER

Come on, let's watch the girls.

FACTORY GIRL

...On behalf of the workers... sir...

I wish you a happy birthday...

SCHINDLER

Thank you.

SCHINDLER

Thank them for me.

PFEFFERBERG (O.S.)

Commandant, sir.

GOETH

My mechanic.

PFEFFERBERG

What about my wife?

BOY'S VOICE

This is our place.

GOETH

I tried to call you, I'm running a

little late, this is taking longer

than I thought. Have a drink.

SCHINDLER

What's going on?

GOETH

I got a shipment of Hungarians coming

in, I got to make room for them.

It's always something.

GOETH

They're complaining now? They don't

know what complaining is.

SCHINDLER

What do you say we get your fire

brigade out here and hose down the

cars?

GOETH

Bring the fire trucks!

HUJAR

What?

GOETH

This is really cruel, Oskar, you're

giving them hope. You shouldn't do

that, that's cruel.

SCHINDLER

I've got some 200-meter hoses back

at D.E.F., we can reach the cars

down at the end.

GOETH

Hujar!

GUARD

What does he think he's saving them

from?

GOETH

Oh, my God.

SCHINDLER

I'm not saying you'll regret it, but

you might. I want you to be aware of

that.

GESTAPO 1

We'll risk it.

SCHINDLER

All right, sure, it's a nice day,

I'll go for a drive with you guys.

SCHINDLER

Where are we going?

SCHINDLER

I violated the Race and Resettlement

Act. Though I doubt they can point

out the actual provision to me.

(pause)

I kissed a Jewish girl.

GOETH

He likes women. He likes good-looking

women. He sees a good-looking woman,

he doesn't think. This guy has so

many women. They love him. He's

married, he's got all these women.

All right, she was Jewish, he

shouldn't have done it. But you didn't

see this girl. I saw this girl. This

girl was very good-looking.

GOETH

They cast a spell on you, you know,

the Jews. You work closely with them

like I do, you see this. They have

this power, it's like a virus. Some

of my men are infected with this

virus. They should be pitied, not

punished. They should receive

treatment, because this is as real

as typhus. I see this all the time.

GOETH

It's a matter of money? We can discuss

that. That'd be all right with me.

SS COLONEL

You're offering me a bribe?

GOETH

A "bribe?" No, no, please come on...

a gratuity.

SCHERNER

Sit down.

SCHERNER

Hello, Amon.

GOETH

Sir.

SS OFFICER

I want to hear "Gloomy Sunday" again.

SCHERNER

We give you Jewish girls at five

marks a day, Oskar, you should kiss

us, not them.

GOETH

God forbid you ever get a real taste

for Jewish skirt. There's no future

in it. No future. They don't have a

future. And that's not just good old-

fashioned Jew-hating talk. It's policy

now.

SS OFFICER

"Gloomy Sunday" again.

TREBLINKA GUY

-- We can process at Treblinka, if

everything is working? I don't know,

maybe two thousand units a day.

TREBLINKA GUY

Now Auschwitz. Now you're talking.

What I got is nothing, it's like

a... a machine. Auschwitz, though,

now there's a death factory. There,

they know how to do it. There, they

know what they're doing.

GOETH

Enough -- Jesus -- God --

GOETH

Can you believe this?

GOETH

I'm trying to live my life, they

come up with this? I got to find

every body buried up here? And burn

it?

SCHINDLER

You took my workers.

GOETH

(indignant)

They're taking mine. When I said

they didn't have a future I didn't

mean tomorrow.

(pause)

Auschwitz.

SCHINDLER

When?

GOETH

I don't know. Soon.

GOETH

This is good. I'm out of business

and he's catching tadpoles with his

son.

SCHINDLER

Hey, how you doing?

BRINNLITZ GUY 1

Look at this.

SCHINDLER

Let me buy you a drink.

BRINNLITZ GUY 2

Oskar - my friend Lena.

SCHINDLER

How do you do?

(to them both)

What can I get you, what're you

drinking?

BRINNLITZ GUY 2

Nothing's changed. Then again,

something has changed, hasn't it?

SCHINDLER

Things worked out. I made some money

over there, had some laughs, you

know. It was good.

BRINNLITZ GUY 2

Now you're back.

SCHINDLER

Now I'm back, and you know what I'm

going to do now? I'm going to have a

good time. So are you.

GIRL

Who is he?

BRINNLITZ GUY 2

He's a salesman.

SCHINDLER

Goddamn it.

GOETH

You want these people.

SCHINDLER

These people, my people, I want my

people.

GOETH

What are you, Moses? What is this?

Where's the money in this? What's

the scam?

SCHINDLER

It's good business.

GOETH

Oh, this is "good business" in your

opinion. You've got to move them,

the equipment, everything to

Czechoslovakia -- it doesn't make

any sense.

SCHINDLER

Look --

GOETH

You're not telling me something.

SCHINDLER

It's good for me -- I know them, I'm

familiar with them. It's good for

you -- you'll be compensated. It's

good for the Army. You know what I'm

going to make?

SCHINDLER

Artillery shells. Tank shells. They

need that. Everybody's happy.

GOETH

Yeah, sure.

GOETH

You're probably scamming me somehow.

If I'm making a hundred, you got to

be making three.

GOETH

If you admit to making three, then

it's four, actually. But how?

SCHINDLER

I just told you.

GOETH

You did, but you didn't.

GOETH

Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll

go along with it, it's just irritating

to me I can't figure it out.

SCHINDLER

All you have to do is tell me what

it's worth to you. What's a person

worth to you.

GOETH

What's one worth to you? That's the

question.

HARD CUT TO:

SCHINDLER

Poldek Pfefferberg... Mila

Pfefferberg...

GOETH

A virus...

SCHINDLER

You can do the same thing I'm doing.

There's nothing stopping you.

MADRITSCH

I've done enough for the Jews.

SCHINDLER

The investors.

SCHINDLER

All of them. Szerwitz, his family.

STERN

Four hundred, four fifty --

SCHINDLER

More.

STERN (O.S.)

About six hundred --

SCHINDLER (O.S.)

More.

STERN (O.S.)

Eight hundred, give or take.

SCHINDLER

(angrily)

Give or take what, Stern -- how many --

count them.

SCHINDLER

That's it.

SCHINDLER

You can finish that page.

STERN

What did Goeth say? You just told

him how many you needed?

SCHINDLER

I'm buying them. I'm paying him. I

give him money, he gives me the

people.

(pause)

If you were still working for me I'd

expect you to talk me out of it,

it's costing me a fortune.

SCHINDLER

Give him the list, he'll sign it,

he'll get the people ready. I have

to go back to Brinnlitz, to take

care of things on that end, I'll see

you there.

SCHINDLER

Finish the page.

SCHINDLER

This is my home.

SCHINDLER

I was born here, my wife was born

here, my mother is buried here, this

is my home.

SCHINDLER

Do you really think I'd bring a

thousand Jewish criminals into my

home?

SCHINDLER

These are skilled munitions workers --

they are essential to the war effort --

SCHINDLER

-- It is my duty to supervise them --

and it is your duty to allow me --

PRISONER

Am I on the list?

GOLDBERG

What list is that?

GOLDBERG

The good list? Well, that depends,

doesn't it?

GOLDBERG

Hey, Poldek, how's it going?

(Pfefferberg ignores

him)

You know about the list? You're on

it.

PFEFFERBERG

Of course I'm on it.

GOLDBERG

You want to stay on it? What do you

got for me?

PFEFFERBERG

What do I got for you?

GOLDBERG

Takes diamonds to stay on this list.

PFEFFERBERG

I'll kill you, that's what I got for

you.

GOLDBERG

All right, all right, all right.

SCHINDLER

You'll be interested to know I

received a cable this morning from

the Personnel Office, Plaszow. The

women have left. They should be

arriving here sometime tomorrow.

WOMAN

Where are the clerks?

SCHINDLER

They're in Auschwitz.

GESTAPO

Your friend Amon Goeth has been

arrested.

SCHINDLER

(pause)

I'm sorry to hear that.

GESTAPO

There are some things that are

unclear. We need to talk.

SCHINDLER

I'd love to, it'll have to wait until

I get back. I have to leave.

SCHINDLER

All right, okay, let's talk.

GESTAPO

In Breslau.

SCHINDLER

Breslau? I can't go to Breslau. Not

now.

YOUNG DOCTOR

How old are you, Mother?

WOMAN

(pause)

Sir, a mistake's been made. We're

not supposed to be here, we work for

Oskar Schindler. We're Schindler

Jews.

YOUNG DOCTOR

And who on earth is Oskar Schindler?

PLASZOW GUARD

He had a factory in Cracow.

Enamelware.

YOUNG DOCTOR

A potmaker?

INVESTIGATOR

Everything you say will be held in

confidence. You are not under

investigation. You are not under

investigation. Mr. Goeth is. He is

being held on charges of embezzlement

and racketeering. You're here at his

request to corroborate his denials.

Our information onto his financial

speculations comes from many sources.

On his behalf there is only you. We

know you are close friends. We know

this is hard for you. But we must

ask you --

SCHINDLER

He stole our country blind.

MILA

Where's Schindler now?

HOSS

You're right, a clerical error has

bee made.

(pause)

Let me offer you this in apology for

the inconvenience. I have a shipment

coming in tomorrow, I'll cut you

three hundred from it. New ones.

These are fresh.

HOSS

The train comes, we turn it around,

it's yours.

SCHINDLER

I appreciate it. I want these.

HOSS

You shouldn't get stuck on names.

HOSS

That's right, it creates a lot of

paperwork.

SCHINDLER

These are mine. They're on the list.

These are my workers. They should be

on the train.

SCHINDLER

They're skilled munition workers.

They're essential.

GUARD

They're boys.

SCHINDLER

Yes.

SCHINDLER

Their fingers. They polish the insides

of shell casings. How else do you

expect me to polish the inside of a

45 millimeter shell casing?

SCHINDLER

Under Department W provisions, it is

unlawful to kill a worker without

just cause. Under the Businesses

Compensation Fund I am entitled to

file damage claims for such deaths.

If you shoot without thinking, you

go to prison and I get paid, that's

how it works. So there will be no

summary executions here. There will

be no interference of any kind with

production. In hopes of ensuring

that, guards will no longer be allowed

on the factory floor without my

authorization.

SCHINDLER

For your cooperation, you have my

gratitude.

SCHINDLER

How's it going?

WORKER

Good. It's taken a while to calibrate

the machines, but it's going good

now.

SCHINDLER

Good.

SCHINDLER

This isn't right, is it?

SCHINDLER

There. That looks right.

SCHINDLER

How's it going, Rabbi?

LEVARTOV

Good, sir.

SCHINDLER

Sun's going down.

SCHINDLER

It is Friday, isn't it?

LEVARTOV

Is it?

SCHINDLER

You should be preparing for the

Sabbath, shouldn't you? What are you

doing here?

SCHINDLER

I've got some wine in my office. Why

don't we go over there, I'll give it

to you. Come on, let's go.

SCHINDLER

Come on.

GUARD

What is that?

SCHINDLER

I want you to come work for me.

SCHINDLER

You don't have to live with me, I

wouldn't ask that.

(pause)

It's a nice place. You'd like it. It

looks awful. You get used to that.

SCHINDLER

All right --

(now he'll be honest)

We can spend time together that way.

We can see each other, see how it

goes -- without the strain of --

whatever you want to call it when a

man, a husband and a wife go out to

dinner, go have a drink, go to a

party, you know. This way we'll see

each other at work, there we are,

same place, we see how it goes...

SCHINDLER

Itzhak Stern, Emilie Schindler. My

wife.

STERN

How do you do?

EMILIE

How do you do?

STERN

Stern is my accountant and friend.

SCHINDLER

Emilie's offered to work in the

clinic. To... work there.

STERN

(to her)

That's very generous of you.

SCHINDLER

Yes.

STERN

It was a pleasure meeting you.

EMILIE

Pleasure meeting you.

SCHINDLER

Can you fix it? The radio.

PFEFFERBERG

What's wrong with it?

SCHINDLER

How should I know? It's broken. See

what you can do.

STERN

We need to talk.

SCHINDLER

Stern.

STERN

They arrived.

SCHINDLER

They arrived, can you believe it?

STERN

We've received a complaint from the

Armaments Board. A very angry

complaint. The artillery shells, the

tank shells, rocket casings --

apparently all of them -- have failed

quality-control tests.

SCHINDLER

Well, that's to be expected. They

have to understand. These are start-

up problems. This isn't pots and

pans, this is a precise business.

I'll write them a letter.

STERN

They're withholding payment.

SCHINDLER

Well, sure. So would I. So would

you. I wouldn't worry about it. We'll

get it right one of these days.

STERN

There's a rumor you've been going

around miscalibrating the machines.

(Schindler doesn't

deny it)

I don't think that's a good idea.

SCHINDLER

(pause)

No?

STERN

They could close us down.

SCHINDLER

All right. Call around, find out

where we can buy shells and buy them.

We'll pass them off as ours.

STERN

I know what you're saying, but I

don't see the difference.

SCHINDLER

You don't? I do. I see a difference.

STERN

You'll lose money. That's one

difference.

SCHINDLER

Fewer shells will be made.

SCHINDLER

Stern, if this factory ever produces

a shell that can actually be fired...

I'll be very unhappy.

SCHINDLER (O.S.)

Hey.

LIEPOLD

Department W does not forbid my

presence on the factory floor. That

is a lie.

SCHINDLER

Shoot him. Shoot him!

SCHINDLER

Shoot him without a hearing. Come

on.

LIEPOLD

He sabotaged the machine.

SCHINDLER

The machine's broken?

LIEPOLD

The prisoner is under the jurisdiction

of Section D. I'll preside over the

hearing.

SCHINDLER

But the machine.

SCHINDLER

The machine is under the authorization

of the Armaments Inspectorate. I

will preside over the hearing.

JANEK

I'm unfamiliar with the Hilo machines.

I don't know why I was assigned there.

SCHINDLER

If you're not skilled at armaments

work, you shouldn't be here.

JANEK

I'm a lathe operator.

JANEK

Sir?

JANEK

I did adjust the pressure controls.

SCHINDLER

What?

JANEK

I know that much about them. Somebody

had set the pressure controls wrong.

I had to adjust --

SCHINDLER

The stupidity of these people. I

wish they were capable of sabotaging

a machine.

SCHINDLER

Get him out of my sight.

SCHINDLER

(to Emilie)

Isn't this nice.

RASCH

Oskar, good of you to come.

SCHINDLER

Are you kidding, I never miss a party.

Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.

RASCH

How do you do?

EMILIE

You have a lovely home. It is nice.

Big.

RASCH

Thank you.

SCHINDLER

I need a drink.

RASCH

Oh, God, you don't have a drink?

SCHINDLER

(to Emilie)

Wine?

RASCH

Your husband's a very generous man.

EMILIE

(wry)

He's always been.

SCHINDLER

I need guns.

SCHINDLER

One of these days the Russians are

going to show up unannounced at my

gate. I'd like the chance to defend

myself. I'd like my wife to have

that chance. My civilian engineers.

My secretary.

RASCH

(pause; then,

philosophically)

We're losing the war, aren't we.

SCHINDLER

It kind of looks that way.

RASCH

(blithely)

Pistols?

SCHINDLER

Pistols, rifles, carbines ...

(long pause)

I'd be grateful.

SCHINDLER

(calmly)

Careful.

SCHINDLER

Stern.

STERN

Excuse me.

STERN

I'll talk to you later.

SCHINDLER

No, no, what, what is it?

STERN

Do you have any money I don't know

about? Hidden away someplace?

SCHINDLER

No.

SCHINDLER

Why, am I broke?

SCHINDLER (V.O.)

Poldek.

SCHINDLER

It's been suggested I cremate them

in my furnaces. As a Catholic I will

not. As a human being I will not.

PRIEST

There's an area beyond the church

reserved for the burial of suicides.

Maybe I can convince the parish

council to allow them to be buried

there.

SCHINDLER

These aren't suicides.

SCHINDLER

These are victims of a great murder.

STERN

What's he doing here?

SCHINDLER

Probably looking for a handout.

GOETH

Thank you.

GOETH

Where are the guards?

SCHINDLER

The guards aren't allowed on the

factory floor. They make my workers

nervous.

SCHINDLER

I'll discipline him later.

SCHINDLER

It's time the guards came into the

factory.

SCHINDLER

The unconditional surrender of Germany

has just been announced. At midnight

tonight the war is over.

SCHINDLER

Tomorrow, you'll begin the process

of looking for survivors of your

families. In many cases you won't

find them. After six long years of

murder, victims are being mourned

throughout the world.

SCHINDLER

We've survived. Some of you have

come up to me and thanked me. Thank

yourselves. Thank your fearless Stern,

and others among you, who, worrying

about you, have faced death every

moment.

(glancing away)

Thank you.

SCHINDLER

You've shown extraordinary discipline.

You've behaved humanely here. You

should be proud.

SCHINDLER

I'm a member of the Nazi party. I'm

a munitions manufacturer. I'm a

profiteer of slave labor, I'm a

criminal. At midnight, you will be

free and I will be hunted.

(pause)

I'll remain with you until five

minutes after midnight After which

time, and I hope you'll forgive me,

I have to flee.

SCHINDLER

In memory of the countless victims

among your people, I ask us to observe

three minutes of silence.

SCHINDLER

I know you've received orders from

our Commandant -- which he has

received from his superiors -- to

dispose of the population of this

camp.

SCHINDLER

Now would be the time to do it.

They're all here. This is your

opportunity.

SCHINDLER

Or...

(he shrugs)

...you could leave. And return to

your families as men instead of

murderers.

LEVARTOV

We've written a letter trying to

explain things. In case you're

captured. Every worker has signed

it.

SCHINDLER

Thank you.

STERN

It's Hebrew. It says, 'Whoever saves

one life, saves the world.'

SCHINDLER

(to himself)

I could've got more out...

SCHINDLER

(to himself)

I could've got more... if I'd just...

I don't know, if I'd just... I

could've got more...

STERN

Oskar, there are twelve hundred people

who are alive because of you. Look

at them.

SCHINDLER

If I'd made more money... I threw

away so much money, you have no idea.

If I'd just...

STERN

There will be generations because of

what you did.

SCHINDLER

I didn't do enough.

STERN

You did so much.

SCHINDLER

This car. Goeth would've bought this

car. Why did I keep the car? Ten

people, right there, ten more I

could've got.

(looking around)

This pin --

SCHINDLER

Two people. This is gold. Two more

people. He would've given me two for

it. At least one. He would've given

me one. One more. One more person. A

person, Stern. For this. One more. I

could've gotten one more person I

didn't.

SCHINDLER

They killed so many people...

(Stern, weeping too,

embraces him)

They killed so many people...

PARTISAN

It's all over.

PFEFFERBERG

We know.

PARTISAN

(pause)

So what are you doing? You're free

to go home.

PFEFFERBERG

When the Russians arrive. Until then

we're staying here.

SS NCO

Hello?

NCO IN CHARGE

Thank you very much.

RUSSIAN

You have been liberated by the Soviet

Army.

RUSSIAN

What's wrong?

WORKER

Have you been in Poland?

RUSSIAN

I just came from Poland.

WORKER

Are there any Jews left?

WORKER

Where should we go?

RUSSIAN

I don't know. Don't go east, that's

for sure, they hate you there.

(pause)

I wouldn't go west either if I were

you.

WORKER

We could use some food.

RUSSIAN

Isn't that a town over there?

HARD CUT TO:

SCHINDLER

Hey, how you doing?

PFEFFERBERG

Good. How's it going?

SCHINDLER

Things are great, things are great.

PFEFFERBERG

What are you doing?

SCHINDLER

I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll

have a drink.

PFEFFERBERG

I mean where have you been? Nobody's

seen you around for a while.

SCHINDLER

(puzzled)

I've been here. I guess I haven't

been out.

PFEFFERBERG

I thought maybe you'd like to come

over, have some dinner, some of the

people are coming over.

SCHINDLER

Yeah? Yeah, that'd be nice, let me

get my coat.

SCHINDLER'S VOICE

Mila's good?

PFEFFERBERG'S VOICE

She's good.

SCHINDLER'S VOICE

Kids are good? Let's stop at a store

on the way so I can buy them

something.

PFEFFERBERG'S VOICE

They don't need anything. They just

want to see you.

SCHINDLER'S VOICE

Yeah, I know. I'd like to pick up

something for them. It'll only take

a minute.

THE END
