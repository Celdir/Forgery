TITLE

A P O C A L Y P S E   N O W

Original screenplay by John Milius.

Inspired by Joseph Conrad's "HEART OF DARKNESS".

This draft by Francis Ford Coppola.

December 3, 1975.

MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW

CHARLIE

... It's crazy -- sugar is up to

200 dollars a ton -- sugar !

LAWYER

What about oil ?

CHARLIE

Food, oil --look, let me show you

something. This is the economy of

the United States in two years --

CHARLIE

(continuing)

This is West Germany.

(he draws another,

bigger circle)

This is Japan.

(another , bigger)

This is Italy.

(a dot)

This is Iran.

(a very big circle)

And this is Saudi Arabia... In

two years ?

(a gigantic circle)

Do you understand ?

ACCOUNTANT

What's to prevent it ?

CHARLIE

Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,

I didn't build a two-billion-dollar

company in the last twenty years

by doing nothing. We can protect

our interests.

(pause, for a drink)

We are still the most powerful

nation in the world. Militarily.

CHARLIE

(continuing)

You know bodyguard; he was a

captain in Viet Nam. You talk to

him, except he won't talk. This

kind of man can kill you with his

pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.

CHARLIE

(continuing)

Carries a attache case at all

times. You know what's in it ?

(another sip)

An Ingram Machine pistol.

CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.)

WILLARD (V.O.)

The attache case has been empty

for three years, but it makes him

safe to think there's a machine

pistol in it.

I don't like automatic weapons.

They jam.

I saw a friend of mine get

ripped open because he flicked his

M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.

How much money did the contractors

make on the M-16 ?

WILLARD (V.O.)

(continuing)

He likes to hear stories about Nam.

I tell him I can't; they're not

cleared. The truth is he wouldn't

understand.

WILLARD (V.O.)

(continuing)

There's no way I can tell them...

what really happened over there.

I wouldn't've believed it if

someone'd told me.

WILLARD (V.O.)

(continuing)

There was only one part that

mattered -- for me, anyway. I

don't even know if I remember

all of it. I can't remember

how it ended, exactly -- because

when it ended I was insane.

DISSOLVE TO :

WILLARD (V.O.)

But I know how it started

for me -- I was on R. and R.

in Saigon; my first time south

of the DMZ in three months. I

wasn't sure, but I thought this

guy was following me.

CAPTAIN

How about a drink ?

WILLARD

Sure, thanks.

CAPTAIN

Winning the war by yourself.

WILLARD

(he calls for the waiter)

Part.

CAPTAIN

Which part is that ?

WILLARD

My part.

(TO THE WAITER)

Beer, with ice and water.

CAPTAIN

That's good gin.

WILLARD

I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.

CAPTAIN

Delta ?

WILLARD

No.

CAPTAIN

North ?

WILLARD

Yeah. Way north.

CAPTAIN

What unit were you with ?

WILLARD

None.

CAPTAIN

Rangers, eh?

WILLARD

Sort of.

CAPTAIN

Were you Longe Range Recon --

WILLARD

No -- I worked too far north for

LRRP.

CAPTAIN

That's quite an array of ribbons...

WILLARD

Let's talk about you.

CAPTAIN

I was an FO for the 25th.

WILLARD

Tracks ?

CAPTAIN

Yeah.

WILLARD

Fat. That's real fat.

CAPTAIN

Sometimes.

WILLARD

At least you always have enough

water. How many gallons does

each one of those damn things

carry ?

CAPTAIN

Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

WILLARD

You know, I can remember once,

getting back below the DMZ -- and

the first Americans we ran into

were a track squadron. I just

couldn't believe how much water

they had. We'd been chewing

bamboo shoots for almost a week,

and before that, for two weeks,

we'd been drinking anything --

rain water, river shit, stuff

right out of the paddies. And

there were these guys standing

by their trucks spilling water

all over. I could've killed them.

(solemnly)

I swear to God I would have, too,

if ...

CAPTAIN

I didn't know we had units up

there in North Vietnam.

WILLARD

We do.

CAPTAIN

How long were you up there ?

WILLARD

A long time.

CAPTAIN

A year ? Waiter another beer.

WILLARD

I go up on missions. Listen

Captain, buy me all the beer

you want, but you better tell

that asshole over there you're

not going to find out anymore

about me.

WILLARD

(continuing)

What do you want ?

CIVILIAN

(indicating the Army jeep)

If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon

Group, we'd like you to come with

us.

WILLARD

Whose orders ?

CAPTAIN

Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th

A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --

Com-Sec -- Intelligence --

Nha Trang.

WILLARD

Who are you ?

CIVILIAN

The agency.

WILLARD (V.O.)

They took me to some place outside

Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters

for all operations in South East Asia.

I'd worked for Intelligence before --

WILLARD

Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,

reporting as ordered, sir.

COLONEL (O.S.)

Okay, Willard, sit down.

COLONEL

Have you ever seen this officer

before, Captain Willard ?

WILLARD

No, sir.

COLONEL

This gentleman or myself ?

WILLARD

No, sir.

COLONEL

I believe on your last job you

executed a tax collector in Kontum,

is that right ?

WILLARD

I am not presently disposed to

discuss that, sir.

MAJOR

Very good.

COLONEL

You know much about about Special Forces;

Green Berets, Captain ?

WILLARD

I've worked with them on occasions

and I saw the movie , sir.

COLONEL

Then you can appreciate Command's

concern over their -- shall we say

'erratic' methods of operation.

(pause)

I have never favored elite units,

Captain, including your paratroopers

or whatever. Just because a man

jumps out of an airplane or wears

a silly hat doesn't give him any

priviliges in my book -- not in

this man's army.

MAJOR

We didn't need 'em in Korea --

no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy

and an M-1 Garand, none of this

fancy crap -- no sir.

CIVILIAN

(stopping him)

Major.

COLONEL

We have Special Forces A

detachments all along the

Cambodian border. Two here and

another one here -- twelve or

fourteen Americans -- pretty

much on their own; they train

and motivate Montagnard natives;

pick their own operations. If

they need something, they call

for it, and get it within

reason. What we're concerned

with is here.

COLONEL

The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

It was originally a larger base,

built up along the river in an

old Cambodian fortress.

The area has been relatively

quiet for the past two years --

but --

COLONEL

... Captain, we know something's

going on up there -- Major --

MAJOR

Communications naturally dwindled

with the lack of V.C. activity,

this is routine, expected ... but

six months ago communication

virtually stopped.

COLONEL

About the same time -- large numbers

of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent

began leaving the area -- this in

itself is not unusual since these

people have fought with the Rhade

Tribe that lived in the area for

centuries. But what is unusual is

that we began to find Rhade refugees

too -- in the same sampans as the

M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid

of V.C. They've put up with war

for twenty years -- but something

is driving them out.

MAJOR

We communicate with the base

infrequently. What they call for

are air strikes, immediate --

always at night. And we don't

know what or who the air strikes

are called on.

WILLARD

Who ?

MAJOR

You see, no one has really gone

into this area and come back alive.

WILLARD

Why me ?

MAJOR

Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,

Special Forces. We understand

you knew him.

WILLARD

Yeah.

COLONEL

He's commanding the detachment

at Nu Mung Ba.

VOICE (ON TAPE)

Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick --

Mark flare -- affirmative damn --

Immediate receive -- hearing

automatic weapons fire man ...

SECOND VOICE

Blue Delta five

This Big Rhine -- three

Need that ordinance immediately

Goddamn give it to me immediate

Christ -- Big Rhino --

Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn.

THIRD VOICE

This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta.

MAJOR

That's Colonel Kurtz.

KURTZ (V.O.)

I want that napalm dropped in the

trees -- spread it among the

branches.

We'll give you a flare -- an

orange one -- bright orange.

(STATIC)

We'd also like some white phosporous,

Blue Delta. White phosporous, give

it to me.

WILLARD

I only met Kurtz once.

CIVILIAN

Would he remember you ?

WILLARD

Maybe.

COLONEL

What was your impression of him ?

CIVILIAN

You didn't like him.

WILLARD

Anyone got a cigarette.

WILLARD

(continuing)

I thought he was a lame.

COLONEL

A lame ?

WILLARD

This is years ago, before he

joined Special Forces, I guess.

We had an argument.

COLONEL

About what ?

WILLARD

I don't know. He was a lame,

that's all.

COLONEL

But why ?

WILLARD

He couldn't get through a

sentence without all these

big words; about why we kill.

COLONEL

Well, he's killing now.

WILLARD

Maybe.

CIVILIAN

What does that mean ?

WILLARD

Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't

believe he's capable of that.

I just don't believe it.

COLONEL

It's got to be Kurtz.

CIVILIAN

The point is that Kurtz or

somebody attacked a South

Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three

days ago. Last week a Recon

helicopter was lost in the area --

another took heavy damage --

direct fire from their base

camp.

WILLARD

Our Recon flight ?

CIVILIAN

Ours.

WILLARD

Touchy.

CIVILIAN

You can see, of course, the

implications, if any of this --

even rumours leaked out.

WILLARD

You want me to clean it up --

simple and quiet.

CIVILIAN

Exactly -- you'll go up the

Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --

appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by

accident, re-establish your

acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,

find out what's happened -- and

why. Then terminate his command.

WILLARD

Terminate ?

CIVILIAN

Terminate with extreme prejudice.

WILLARD (V.O.)

I met the P.B.R. crew; they were

pretty much all kids, except for

Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's

Mate Third Class L. Johnson --

Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate

Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef --

Radio Operator Second Class T.

Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.

WILLARD

Chief, try to keep out of where

we're going -- Why we're goin' and

what's gonna be the big surprise.

CHIEF

All right with me, I used to drive

a taxi.

WILLARD

Let's go.

DISSOLVE TO :

DISSOLVE TO :

DISSOLVE TO :

CHIEF

The Delta closes off to us about

ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll

be able to pick up some supplies --

bit I think there are only two

points we can draw enough water

to get into the Nung River. It's

all Charlie's turf from there on

out.

WILLARD

We're gonna have some help to

get in the river. You know

these waters, Chief ?

CHIEF

'Bout six months ago I took a man

up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was

regular Army too. Shot himself

in the head. I brought his body

back down.

WILLARD

Shot himself. What for ?

CHIEF

Beats me -- the sun was too much

for him, or the mud. Who knows ?

WILLARD

Arch light.

CHEF

I hate that -- Every time I hear

that noise something terrible

happens.

CHIEF

Anybody see some smoke ?

CLEAN

Too far inland.

LANCE

There they are.

CLEAN

Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not

till it's too late -- don't have

to hit you neither, concussion'll

do it for a quarter mile or better.

Burst your ears -- suck the air

outta your lungs.

WILLARD (V.O.)

The dossier on A detachment had

letters from Kurtz' wife and the

wives and families of his men.

All asking where to send future

mail, understanding the necessery

silence due to the nature of

their work -- None of the men had

written home in half a year.

WILLARD (V.O.)

Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a

dedicated and well-disciplined

spirit. He is a fine officer,

combining military efficiency --

with a broad background in the

Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ...

WILLARD (V.O.)

(continuing)

... He views his military career

as the dedication of his talents

to bringing our values and way of

life to those darker, less

fortunate areas in the world.

WILLARD (V.O.)

(continuing)

... I feel Captain Kurtz' request

for Special Forces training is

highly unusual in regard to his

past humanitarian concerns, and

his somewhat liberal politics,

though I can see no reason to

deny it.

WILLARD (V.O.)

(continuing)

... We feel Major Kurtz' need to

bring a sense of Western culture

to the backward peoples of these

areas will be of use in

accordance with our 'Vietnamization'

programs ...

DISSOLVE TO :

WILLARD (V.O.)

One day later we came to an

advanced staging area along the

coast. This was our last chance

to pick up supplies before

approaching the mouth of the

Nung River.

LANCE

Hey.

CHIEF

Lance -- I want you to go with the

Captain an' get three extra drums

of fuel and maybe scrounge some

more 50 caliber.

LANCE

Yeah -- look at those uniforms.

CHIEF

Poor bastards, have a long year

to go.

SERGEANT

I don't know anything about these

papers, sir.

WILLARD

They're in order -- it's perfectly

clean -- just check with ComSec-

Intel like I said.

SERGEANT

Well, you know I don't have the

priority to do that, sir. It

says here not to contact Com-Sec-

Int. Who's your commanding

officer ?

WILLARD

Right now -- I am.

SERGEANT

Well who the hell verifies that ?

WILLARD

I do.

CHIEF

No shit -- what's all the activity

for around here ?

SERGEANT

The show --

WILLARD

What show ?

SERGEANT

Big show in the parade grounds

this noon -- some boss stuff --

WILLARD

This -- Bob Hope or the like --

SERGEANT

No sir, I think -- this'll be a

little bit different --

CHIEF

Where's it gonna be ?

DISSOLVE TO :

CHEF

It's really too much -- I mean

I've collected every picture of

her since she was Miss December.

CLEAN

Yeah -- you can really get hung

up on them like the cat in the

Delta.

CHIEF

What cat  ?

CLEAN

One that went up for murder -- he

was an Army Sergeant.

CHIEF

I never heard about that.

CLEAN

Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy

mag, man -- I mean like he was there

when it arrived -- He just knew.

CHEF

So what happened ?

CLEAN

He was working A.R.V.N. patrols

and had one a them little cocky

gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,

the Lieutenant took his new Playboy

one day, sat on the end of the dock,

and wouldn't give it back.

CHEF

Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

CLEAN

Then went too far -- he sat

there and starts mutilating the

centerfold. Poking pins in her an'

all that. Sergeant says, don't do

her like that. You leave your

shitty little hands off that girl.

Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in

Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't

do that again. You'll wish you

hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked

his iron to rock and roll and gave

the little zero a long burst

through the Playboy mag. Man, it

blew him clean off the dock --

Hell, just the magazine was floatin'

there all full of holes.

CHIEF

They nail him for it bad ?

CLEAN

He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't

give him no medals or nothing --

AGENT

I'd like to say hello from all of

us up here, to all of you out there.

All of you who've worked so hard

during Operation Brute Force --

Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen

-- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.

And I want you to know that we feel

proud of you and know how hard your

job is. To prove it -- we've brought

some entertainment we think you're

gonna like: The Playmate of the Year

and her two runners up !

CUT TO:

WILLARD (V.O.)

Two days out of Hau Fat, there was

nothing but us and the coastline.

I felt like I had set off for

the center of the earth...

CHIEF

Smoke !

WILLARD

Where ?

WILLARD

Black smoke ... secondary burning.

CHIEF

Yeah -- fishing village --

helicopters over there. Hueys,

lots of 'em.

WILLARD

First Air Cavalry. They're the

ones gonna get us into the River.

KILGORE

(bellowing)

Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line

back about a hundred yards -- give

me some room to breathe.

KILGORE

Bring me some cards.

GUARD

Sir ?

KILGORE

Body cards, you damn fool --

cards !

WILLARD

(formally)

Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th

Recon Group -- I carry priority

papers from Com-Sec Intelligence

11 Corp -- I believe you understand

the nature of my mission.

KILGORE

(not looking up)

Yeah -- Na Trang told me to

expect you -- we'll see what we

can do. Just stay out of my way

till this is done, Captain.

KILGORE

(to himself)

Six a spades -- eight a hearts --

Isn't one worth a Jack in this

whole place.

KILGORE

What ? Here. You sure?

KILGORE

(continuing)

What's your name, sailor ?

LANCE

Gunner's Mate, Third Class --

L. Johnson, sir.

KILGORE

Lance Johnson? The surfer?

LANCE

That's right, sir.

KILGORE

It's an honor to meet you Lance.

I've admired your nose-riding for

years -- I like your cutback, too.

I think you have the best cutback

there is.

LANCE

Thank you, sir.

KILGORE

You can cut out the sir, Lance --

I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy

foot.

KILGORE (O.S.)

This is Mike from San Diego and

Johnny from Malibu -- they're good

solid surfers -- none of us are

anywhere near your class, though.

WILLARD

My orders are from Com-Sec

Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --

KILGORE

Just hold up a second, Captain --

I'll get to you soon enough --

We've got things to do here.

KILGORE

(continuing)

... we do a lot of surfing around

here. Like to finish up operations

early and fly down to Vung Tau for

the evening glass. Have you ever

surfed the point at Vung Tau? I

liked the beach breaks around Na

Trang a lot -- good lefts.

KILGORE

(continuing)

... we keep three boards in my

Command Huey at all times. You

never can tell when you're gonna

run into something good. I got a

guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict

a swell two days in advance. We

try to work it in.

KILGORE

(continuing; to himself)

Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw

one.

KILGORE

Where've you been riding, Lance?

LANCE

I haven't surfed since I got here.

KILGORE

That's terrible -- we'll change

that -- I'd like to see you work --

I've always liked your cutback;

got a hell of a left turn, too.

DISSOLVE TO :

KILGORE

Why the hell you wanna go up

to Nu Mung Ba for?

WILLARD

I got bored in Saigon.

KILGORE

What's the furthest you been

in?

WILLARD

Haiphong.

KILGORE

Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?

WILLARD

No. Walked.

KILGORE

What'd you do for supplies?

WILLARD

(he shrugs)

Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --

they put out caches.

KILGORE

Can you trust them?

WILLARD

No. They put out two or three

for every one I needed. When

you get to the one you'll use,

you just stake it out. If

something feels wrong, you just

pass it up. On one mission, I

had to pass up three and ended

up living on rats and chocolate

bars.

KILGORE

Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter

Kurtz commanded a Green Beret

detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

WILLARD

When did you hear?

KILGORE

'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz

still alive?

WILLARD

Who knows.

KILGORE

Seems to me he got himself

fragged. i heard some grunt

rolled a grenade in his tent.

Maybe a rumor. Helluva man --

remarkable officer. Walter

Kurtz woulda been a General

some day. General of the Army.

Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs

of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?

WILLARD

I met him.

KILGORE

Don't you agree?

WILLARD

He musta changed !

(pointing to the map)

I got to get into the Nung

River, here or here.

KILGORE

That village you're pointing at

is kinda hairy.

WILLARD

Hairy ?

KILGORE

I mean it's hairy -- they got some

pretty heavy ordnance, boy --

I've lost a few recon ships in

there now and again.

WILLARD

So? I heard you had a good bunch

of killers here.

KILGORE

And I don't intend to get some of

them chewed up just to get your

tub put in the mouth of the

goddman Nung River. You say you

don't know Kurtz?

WILLARD

I met him.

KILGORE

You talk like him. I don't

mind taking casualties,

Captain, but I like to keep

my ratio ten to one in this

unit -- ten Cong to one.

WILLARD

You'll find enough Cong up there.

KILGORE

What about this point here?

KILGORE

(continuing)

What's the name of that goddamn

village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook

names all sound the same.

KILGORE

(continuing)

Mike, you know anything about

the point at Vin Drip Drop?

MIKE

Boss left.

KILGORE

What do you mean?

MIKE

It's really long left slide,

breaks on the short side of the

point -- catches a south swell.

LANCE

Nice.

KILGORE

Why the hell didn't you tell me

about that place -- a good left.

(to Willard)

There aren't any good left slides

in this whole, shitty country.

It's all goddamn beach break.

MIKE

It's hairy ,though. That's

where we lost McDonnel -- they

shot the hell out of us. It's

Charlie's point.

KILGORE

How big it is?

MIKE

Six to eight feet.

KILGORE

(to himself)

A six-foot left.

LANCE

Boss. What's the wind like.

MIKE

Light off shore -- really hollow.

WILLARD

We could go in tomorrow at dawn

-- there's always off-shore wind

in the morning.

CHIEF

The draft of that river might be

too shallow on the point.

KILGORE

Hell, we'll pick your boat up and

lay it down like a baby, right

where you want it. This is the

Cav boy -- airmobile. I can

take that point and hold it as

long as I like -- and you can

get anywhere you want up that

river that suits you, Captain.

Hell, a six foot left.

(he turns to an advisor)

You take a gunship back to division

-- Mike, take Lance with you -- let

him pick out a board, and bring me

my Yater Spoon -- the eight six.

TOM

I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's --

KILGORE

(hard)

What is it?

TOM

Well, I mean it's hairy in there

-- it's Charlie's point.

WILLARD

Charlie don't surf.

KILGORE

How do you feel, boy?

GUNNER

Like a mean motherfucker, sir.

KILGORE

Let's go.

OTHERS

KILGORE

(to Willard)

We'll come in low out of the rising

sun -- We'll put on the music about

a mile out.

WILLARD

Music?

KILGORE

Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares

the hell out of the slopes -- the

boys love it.

PILOT

CO-PILOT

We're down, Eagle Thrust -- we're

Hell of a hot L.Z. Need immediate

KILGORE

Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four

Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke

KILGORE

Haven't got time, Hell's Angels --

KILGORE

Fucking savages.

WILLARD

Who?

KILGORE

The enemy. Who else?

KILGORE (O.S.)

(on radio)

Very good, Hell's Angels -- suggest

you follow with cannon fire.

RADIO (V.O.)

This is Baker Delta Four --

KILGORE

Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four

KILGORE

(continuing)

Right along the doors, boy.

KILGORE

(continuing)

Fine... fine... little higher.

Through the roof; yeah, that's

good.

KILGORE

(continuing)

Didn't anybody bring me any

bombs, grenades, claymores or

anything?

LIEUTENANT

You didn't tell me to, sir.

KILGORE

(grumbling)

You shoulda known.

KILGORE

(continuing)

Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?

WILLARD

Automatic weapons flashes along

millimeter guns and AK-47's.

KILGORE

The trees, eh...

KILGORE

(continuing)

Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke

Six. Join me in sparaying some

trees.

RADIO (V.O.)

Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're

What, sir?

KILGORE

I said it's a good swell -- hell

You smell that?

LANCE

What?

KILGORE

Napalm, boy -- nothing else in

KILGORE

I love the smell of napalm in

the morning.

One time we had a hill bombed

for 12 hours. I walked up it

when it was all over; we didn't

find one of 'em ... not one

stinking gook body. They

slipped out in the night -- but

the smell -- that gasoline smell

-- the whole hill -- it smelled

like ...

victory...

You know, some day this war's

gonna end..

KILGORE

Yes, I know.

You don't expect this kid to

LANCE

Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !

KILGORE

Yeah -- yeah, I can understand

Yeah.

WILLARD

When?

LANCE

Any time -- us -- Americans.

WILLARD

I don't think he d of shot us on

the beach but -- he'd of shot us

if he saw me taking the board --

LANCE

A Yater spoon is hard to get --

especially here.

WILLARD

He's a man who knows what he

wants -- he does know what he wants.

CHEF

Can I go get those mangos now?

CHIEF

I'll go with you in a while --

judt hold tight awhile --

LANCE

Captain -- that was all true

about the rats and chocolate

and stuff?

WILLARD

Sure.

LANCE

And you could just tell when

the supplies were booby trapped?

WILLARD

It's a feeling you get in the

jungle. When you get good, you

can find a track and tell not

only how many they are, but

their morale, how far they're

going, whether they're near

their camp, the weapons they're

carrying.

CLEAN

How can you tell their weapons..

an' how far they're going?

WILLARD

Mostly from the imprints when they

put them down to rest. their morale

from the way they drag their feet,

or the joints that may be lying

around. If they're near a base

camp, they wouldn't be conserving

food; they'll be throwing it away

half-eaten. If the branches aren't

broken, their weapons are slung.

But all this is just technique..

There's a feeling you get after a

while, that's what's important.

I was going through a village once.

I was looking for a certain party.

I took off my boots, and walked

into each hut. It was midnight.

I went into three like that and

suddenly I realized I d gone into

each hut the same way -- standing

up -- so the next one I went in on

my belly. An RPD burst took out

the door a bit above my head.

(he shrugs)

Things like that.

KILGORE (V.O.)

(over a loudspeaker)

I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,

boy -- I just want the board

back -- You can understand --

It was one of my best -- You

know how hard it is to get a

board you like, boy. I'm not

gonna hurt or harm you --

Just leave it where I can find

it --

CLEAN

Jesus -- that guy's too damn

much.

CHIEF

I wonder if that was the same

copter.

WILLARD

He's probably got 'em all over

the river with that recording.

We better move now while it's

dark.

CHIEF

Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take

Lance with you --

WILLARD

I'll go with him --

WILLARD

I wanta get my feet on solid land

once in awhile --

WILLARD

CHEF

Yes, sir --

WILLARD

Why they call you that?

CHEF

Call me what, sir?

WILLARD

Chef -- is that 'cause you like

mangoes an' stuff?

CHEF

No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir

-- I'm a sauciere --

WILLARD

A sauciere --

CHEF

That's right, sir -- I come from

New Orleans -- I was raised to

be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.

We specialize in sauces; my whole

family. It's what we do. I was

supposed to go to Paris and study

at the Escoffier School; I was

saving the money. They called

me for my physical so I figured

the Navy had better food.

WILLARD

What are you doing out here?

CHEF

Cook school -- that did it.

WILLARD

How?

CHEF

They lined us all up in front of

a hundred yards of prime rib --

magnificent meat, beautifully

marbled.. Then they started

throwing it in these big

cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.

I looked in, an' it was turning

gray. I couldn't stand it. I

went into radio school.

WILLARD

(whispering)

Was a big tiger -- no shit?

WILLARD

Who stopped to measure him -- let's

get the hell out of here.

CHEF

A motherfucking tiger -- I could've

been killed.

CHIEF

You forgot the mangoes, didn't

you?

CHEF

Mangoes? There as a fucking

tiger in the woods -- I could've

been eaten alive. I'm never

going into that jungle again.

I gotta remember never get out of

the boat; never get outta the boat.

WILLARD (V.O.)

He was right, the Chef -- never

go into the jungle, unless you're

ready to go all the way.

DISSOLVE TO :

WILLARD (V.O.)

What was in the jungle? What was

there, waiting for me?

WILLARD (V.O.)

(continuing)

... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;

was it Kurtz? He was just a name

to me now; I couldn't remember a

face, a voice -- he just didn't

add up to me. all his liberal

bullshit about the end of savagery

-- and the role of our culture,

our way of life...

WILLARD (V.O.)

Our way of life -- I really

started to look forward to

meeting Kurtz again.

Dearest Walt -- I have to confess

something. I know how you feel

about this, but I had to ask Bob

to find out what he could -- I

just couldn't stand it anymore,

not knowing where you are, whether

you're alive or dead. I'm sorry

Walt, I'm sorry I said that. Bob

didn't tell me anything -- he said

he couldn't -- I can't stand it

anymore, Walt -- I just can't

stand it.

WILLARD (V.O.)

I have to take the kids to school

every morning now -- carpools just

Jeff came home with a black eye

on Tuesday but said he won anyway.

He wouldn't tell me what the fight

was about. Jeff keeps asking

where you are -- he has maps of

Viet Nam in his room now. He

misses you very much. I can't

take this much longer, Walt. I

love you and I just can't stand

espanole.

CHEF

(to himself)

I thought it was pretty good,

myself.

CHIEF

What'd he say?

CHEF

Said I speak French like a

Spanish cow.

FRENCHMAN (O.S.)

Laisser tomber vos armes --

CHEF

Put the guns straight up -- stand

away from the mounts.

WILLARD

Do it.

FRENCHMAN (O.S.)

Vous pouvez approcher mais

doucement --

CHEF

Take her in slow.

PHILIPPE

Hands on the heads.

CHIEF

I can't steer with my goddamn

feet.

CHEF

Hey, they speak American.

GASTON

Who is the commanding officer?

CHIEF

I --

WILLARD

I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.

This is Chief Warrant Officer

Phillips -- it's his boat. We

were shot up bad downriver and

need repairs and food -- we can

pay you in gold.

GASTON

Philippe --

LANCE

I'll help you with --

PHILIPPE

Do not move --

GASTON

Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --

WILLARD

As I said, we can pay you in

gold.

GASTON

Entirely unnecessary, Captain.

GASTON

We share a common enemy -- you

are our guests.

(he steps back)

I am Gaston de marais -- this is

my family's plantation. It has

been such for 121 years. It will

be such after I die.

This is my son, Philippe -- he

has fought in Algeria and held

the rank of Captain. And Henry

LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was

at Dien Bien Phu. My personal

servant, Tran Van Kac ---

GASTON

(continuing)

My youngest son -- Christian --

GASTON

Christian's wife -- Ann-Marie --

GASTON

(continuing)

And my youngest daughter --

Claudine.

WILLARD

American weapons?

GASTON

We took them from the dead.

(smiles)

Now -- I assume you want to rest,

to shower. We'll attend to your

repairs after dinner.

CHEF

Shower.

WILLARD

We don't want to bother you any,

we --

GASTON

A man of war is never bothered to

aid an ally -- you will follow me,

Captain.

WILLARD

A habit of men of war, sir --

you understand.

GASTON

Of course, Captain -- an

unfortunate necessity.

CHIEF

What about the boat?

PHILIPPE

My men will keep it for you --

CHIEF

Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the

boat.

WILLARD

Chief.

(pause)

Come with us.

GASTON

A suitable accomodation for

your men, captain -- you will,

of course, be quartered with us --

WILLARD

Go ahead --

GASTON

Captain, this way.

GASTON

(continuing)

Magnificent, eh, Captain?

GASTON

(continuing)

It is very good -- there is no

current -- It is very good. I

have never seen one like it in

all Indochina. I was in Paris

when it arrived -- do you know

what might have caused --

WILLARD

Looks like a two thousand pound

to me. Yeah, a two thousand

pound bomb.

GASTON

No, I've seen those in Normandy.

This is much better.

(pause)

My country -- my country could

never originate this. Magnificent.

CHEF

A hot shower, hot damn.

WILLARD (V.O.)

I wondered -- how long has this room

been like this; how long has the

furniture been standing in these

places?

WILLARD (V.O.)

Was it like this sixty years ago?

Eighty years? But here, even

eighty years is nothing.

WILLARD (V.O.)

It was jungle, once; and it will

be jungle, again...

CHEF

This food is wonderful ! I can't

believe the chef is a slope.

(turning to Clean)

Some more?

CHEF

(continuing)

Hey -- Lance.

LANCE

Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..

wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,

please.

GASTON

Roxanne, I hope you are feeling

better.

ROXANNE

Je vais bien maintenant.

GASTON

May I present Captain Willard?

He is of a paratroop regiment.

You know the difference between a

paratrooper and a regular soldier,

don't you , my dear?

ROXANNE

(smiling and taking

Willard's hand)

Yes, they come from the sky.

WILLARD

I would like to know more about

the .. uh, plaque...

GASTON

Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.

(hard)

This is only  for this war, Captain.

Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese

regular forces -- 15; South

Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular

forces and otherwise.

(pause)

Americain -- 6. Of course, they

were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.

WILLARD

Of course. I -- Once we make

our repairs, we could send word,

we could have you evacuated

from here.

GASTON

Captain?

WILLARD

You'll get blown outta here some

day.

GASTON

We will never 'evacuate', Captain

-- this is our home. Indochina is

ours; it has been so for a hundred

and twenty-one years, there is

something to say for that.

WILLARD

The Vietnamese think it's theirs

-- I guess the Americans do,

too.

GASTON

But we civilized it. A place

belongs to those who bring light

to it, don't you agree.

WILLARD

I always thought the French came

here to get the rubber.

PHILIPPE

Excuse me, I must attend to my

men.

ROXANNE

May I ask where the Captain is

going in his little boat?

WILLARD

We were going upriver when we

got caught in a storm, ma'am.

GASTON

Upriver? Why upriver? There is

nothing there, only jungle.

WILLARD

Do you know that jungle?

GASTON

When I was a boy, my father would

take me there, to hunt. There

are a few savages, but no man

can live there, no white man.

WILLARD

What about an American named

Kurtz?

GASTON

We have never heard of him.

GASTON

(continuing)

Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,

Captain.

WILLARD

Good night.

ROXANNE

You must realize, Captain -- we

have lost much here -- I, my

husband. Gaston -- his wife and

son.

WILLARD

I'm sorry to hear that.

ROXANNE

(rising)

Cognac?

WILLARD

I should be checking on the

boat.

ROXANNE

The war will still be here

tomorrow.

WILLARD

(thinking)

I guess so.

ROXANNE

Do you miss your home, Captain?

Have you someone there?

WILLARD

No. Not really.

I was discharged from the army

four years ago. I went home,

wasted some time, bought a Mustang

Mach 1, drove it a week. Then

I re-upped for another tour. No,

everything I love is here.

ROXANNE

Then you are like us.

ROXANNE

(continuing)

What will you do after the war?

WILLARD

I just follow my footsteps, one

at a time, trying to answer the

little questions and staying away

from the big ones.

ROXANNE

What's a big question?

WILLARD

Kurtz.

(pause)

I know you've heard of him.

ROXANNE

Yes.

WILLARD

What did you hear?

ROXANNE

That strange things.. terrible

things have occured around this

American, Kurtz.

WILLARD

What things?

ROXANNE

Gaston would never tell me. It

was asubject not to be spoken of,

Captain.

WILLARD

Yes.

ROXANNE

Did you know -- deeper in the

jungle, upriver -- there are

savages?

WILLARD

I know.

ROXANNE

But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.

ROXANNE

(continuing)

What a pity, you don't drink.

Since my husband died, there

are so many things I must do

alone.

ROXANNE

(from the sitting room)

Are you warm, Captain?

WILLARD

The river is beautiful.

ROXANNE

I spend hours watching that

river from my bedroom window.

It fascinates me.

ROXANNE

I have been lonely here, Captain.

FADE OUT.

CUT TO.

ROXANNE

I will fix you breakfast.

WILLARD

I'm afraid I won't have time --

I gotta --

ROXANNE

Whe you reach the boat you will

find that half your fifty calibre

stores -- a case of grenades, a

mortar and two M-16's and a

case of clips are being

transfered to us by your order.

WILLARD

So that's it.

ROXANNE

You may think what you wish,

Captain, but I like you very

much.

WILLARD

What if I say no.

ROXANNE

Then Philippe will have to kill

all of you.

GASTON

Two of my men deserted last

night. It happens from time

to time. I assume my daughter

told you of our conditions.

WILLARD

Your daughter.

CHIEF

They taking half our ammo,

Captain -- said it was your orders.

WILLARD

That's right -- I did.

WILLARD

I guess this is whAt men of war

do -- eh?

GASTON

We endure, captain -- you can

blow up the house and we will

live in the cellar -- destroy

that and we'll dig a hole in the

jungle and sleep on it. Burn

the forest and we'll hide in

the swamp. all the while, we

do but one thing -- clean the

blood off our bayonets.

(pause)

Au revoir, Captain.

CHIEF

Next time we  get in a good fire

fight -- I'd like to know how

she was, Captain.

CHEF

Holy shit.

CLEAN

What did you put in all those

ammo boxes?

WILLARD

Rocks, sand -- those two men

who deserted.

CHIEF

When'd you do it?

WILLARD

While you were sleeping.

WILLARD (V.O.)

We moved deeper and deeper into

the jungle. It was very quiet

there. It was like wandering on

a prehistoric planet, an unknown

world ... where the men thought

they crawled to, I don't know.

For me, we crawled toward Kurtz --

exclusively.

CHEF (O.S.)

Flood.

CHIEF (O.S.)

No -- most of 'em are still

standing -- might've been

disease.

WILLARD (O.S.)

I don't know -- there'd still

be some sign -- it's just like

the one this morning.

DISSOLVE TO :

DISSOLVE TO :

CHIEF

-- All right, Lance --

LANCE

The other one --

WILLARD

No -- leave it --

CHIEF

Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --

WILLARD

Thta's not Charlie's work --

WILLARD

Whoever put'em there didn't do it

to kill people -- They put 'em up

as signs --

CHIEF

Signs?

WILLARD

Yeah -- like keep out --

WILLARD (V.O.)

Toward the night of the fifth

day out of Do Lung Bridge, we

judged ourselves about eight

miles from Kurtz' base.

Everything was still, the trees,

the creepers, even the brush

seemed like it had been changed

into some kind of stone. It was

unnatural, like a trance. Not

a sound could be heard. I began

to think I was deaf -- then the

fog came suddenly, and I was

blind too.

WILLARD

Listen.

CHIEF

What is it?

WILLARD

Listen.

CHIEF

They're on the banks of the

river.

LANCE

Jesus !

CHIEF

No, Lance. Not while you can't

see.

CHIEF

Will they attack?

WILLARD

If they have boats ... or

canoes... they'd get lost in

the fog. We can't move either --

we'll end up on the shore.

CHEF

God...

LANCE

Sounds like hundreds of them.

WILLARD

Shhhhhh.

WILLARD

(continuing)

It doesn't sound hostile --

it sounds like they've seen us

coming and it sounds like --

I don't know, a funeral. I

don't understand.

DISSOLVE TO :

WILLARD (V.O.)

Two hours after the fog lifted,

we moved slowly to a spot we

thought was roughly a mile and

a half below Kurtz's camp. We

approached a long sand-bank

stretching down the middle of

the river.

CHIEF

Which way? Right or left?

WILLARD

Who knows? Right.

CHIEF

Looks pretty shallow.

WILLARD

(reading)

Upon reaching objective. Target

key personnel and commence

operation. Should difficulty

arise from which extraction is

impossible, break radio silence

Com-Sec Command code Strong Arm --

indicate purgative air strike --

code -- Street Gang.

(pause)

Purgative air strike ! Purgative !

They'd kill me too !

CHIEF

Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They're

shooting fucking arrows at us.

WILLARD

Steer her right.

WILLARD

Keep going.. keep going.

They're just fucking sticks !

Chief, stay at the helm.

CHIEF

A spear?

WILLARD

Stop it.

Stop it

LANCE

Chief's dead.

WILLARD (V.O.)

It was the strangest thing --

I don't know that I can explain

it. Two of my men dead, and all

I could think of was whether

Kurtz was dead too. That's all

I wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear

Kurtz.

WILLARD (V.O.)

(continuing)

Somehow, in the middle of this ...

carnival, Kurtz had grown into

something -- a gifted officer;

a great man.

Somehow, he was the only light

in this hopeless, hopeless

darkness.

And now I was too late --

he was probably gone, disappeared...

by a grenade rolled into his

tent -- or by some spear on the head.

Christ, I felt like howling like

those animals in the fog.

WILLARD (V.O.)

Here they are in Los Angeles.

Everything is safe. There's a

supermarket around the corner,

the police station around the

other. It would seem ridiculous

to them that I was shot to hell

because I had lost the privilege

of listening to the mysterious

Colonel Kurtz.

(pause)

Of course I was wrong. He was

waiting for me. Kurtz was alive

and he was waiting for me.

DISSOLVE TO :

WILLARD

Just stand here with me where

they can see us. Do nothing.

WILLARD

Moonby what?

AUSTRALIAN

Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal

Australian Regiment, Task Force.

Ex-Corporal Moonby,

deserted

WILLARD

(incredulously, indicating

the hundreds of natives)

What

is

MOONBY

Oh, they're simple enough people.

It's good to see you, baby.

Nobody has any Winstons?

MOONBY

This boat's a mess.

WILLARD

Where's Kurtz? I want to talk

to him.

MOONBY

Oh, you don't talk to Colonel

Kurtz.

(he puffs, then smiles)

You

are good. I kept these people

off you, you know. It wasn't

easy.

WILLARD

Why did they attack us?

MOONBY

Simple. They don't want him to

go.

WILLARD

You're Australian?

MOONBY

Pre-Australian, actually. But

I'd dig goin' to California.

I'm California dreamin'.

WILLARD

(almost to himself)

So Kurtz is alive.

MOONBY

Kurtz. I tell you, that man

has enlarged my mind.

MOONBY

(continuing)

But lemme tell you,

he

most dangerous thing in every

way that I've come on so far.

He wanted to shoot me. The

first thing he said is, 'I'm

going to shoot you because you

are a deserter.' I said I

didn't desert from your army,

I deserted from my army. He

said, 'I'm going to shoot you

just the same.'

WILLARD

Why didn't he shoot you?

MOONBY

I've asked myself that question.

I said to myself, why didn't he

shoot me? He didn't shoot me,

because I had a stash like you

wouldn't believe. I hid it in

the jungle; the wealth of the

Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish

-- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut

Heroin; the Gold of the Golden

Triangle. and Acid -- I make

Koolaid that makes purple Owsley

come on like piss. Now I'm

Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen

he talks. About everything !

Everything. I forgot there's

such a thing as sleep. Everything.

Of love, too.

CHEF

Love?

MOONBY

Oh, no, not what you think...

Cosmic love. He made me see

things -- things, you know.

WILLARD

Sounds like he's gone crazy.

MOONBY

No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be

crazy -- if you heard him talk,

just last week, you'd never think

he was crazy.

WILLARD

Is that where he is? By the

shrunken heads.

Those heads, yes. Well, the

rebels...

to shut up again.

MAN

Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team...

Special Forces. F-82 -- Col.

COLBY

NVA regulars. They're coming

again tonight. Tet -- their

big -- assault.

WILLARD

I'm taking you back.

MOONBY

Oh, no, don t say that.

COLBY

Take us back. Take us back !

But, the operation -- the team.

Colonel Kurtz has such plans for

-- the team.

WILLARD

Take me to him, Major.

COLBY

I had nothing to do with these

operations -- I did not do the

planning -- none of us did.

It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he

was the genius. You'll see --

the genius of our Colonel. He

should be made a General, don't

you think? A General? It's...

WILLARD

Colonel Kurtz, I guess.

KURTZ

I'm Kurtz.

Captain B.L. Willard reporting

his presence, sir.

KURTZ

At ease...

(pause, as he regards him)

Sit down.

KURTZ

(slowly)

Why did you come to ... my province.

WILLARD

We were attacked -- down river.

We need supplies and medical

help.

KURTZ

You were not coming here, to

see me?

WILLARD

(finding it more and

more difficult to go

on with this lie)

No -- no, sir.

KURTZ

You came up my river -- in that

small boat. So simple. I

always thought the final justice

would come from the sky, like

we did.

(pause)

You are the final justice,

aren't you?

WILLARD

What do you mean, Colonel?

KURTZ

(gently)

What other reason could you

have come? A Captain. Ranger.

Paratrooper. Graduate of the

Recondo School. Am I right

about these things?

WILLARD

You know you're right.

KURTZ

Then the Agency approached you.

Maybe in a bar in Quinon or

Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay

for one life. Perhaps a village

elder, or a tax collector.

Nobody's orders but your own.

Exciting work.

KURTZ

You've spent tome at the Royal

Tracking School of Malaysia.

I can tell from the way the

laces on your boots are tied.

I understand you, Captain. We

understand each other.

WILLARD

Do you know me?

KURTZ

Yes.

KURTZ

(continuing)

Do you know

me

CHEF

Holy shit.

CHEF

Captain -- they've been probed

all this week -- Cong and NVA

regulars. There's gonna be a

big offense any time.

WILLARD

I know.

CHEF

What are we doing here?

WILLARD

Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,

just like he said.

KURTZ

Yeah, I can see that. He's

fuckin nuts --

WILLARD

Yeah.

CHEF

He killed that guy without feeling

anything.

WILLARD

Not a thing.

CHEF

When you kill Cong, don't you

feel something.

WILLARD

Sure.

(thinking)

Recoil... I feel the recoil of

my rifle.

WILLARD

This is good -- triple overlapping

fields of fire -- walls so thick

ordinary artillery just cleans

the moss off their surfaces.

WILLARD

(continuing)

I've done things, when I was

alone in the jungle -- that I

never told anyone about.

CHEF

This is evil -- evil, Captain.

We're all gonna die here.

WILLARD

Yeah, I know.

CHEF

I don't get it -- You said your

mission was to kill him. Let's

do it, an' get our asses outta

here. This  Kurtz is ruining the

war; I mean, this don't look

good for America !

WILLARD

(lost in his thoughts)

... he's an amazing officer.

CHEF

You got to kill this sonuvabitch

-- Lance and me, we don' t

understand none of this -- Jesus,

Captain -- I don't wanna die here

WILLARD

Yeah. I know.

MOONBY

He's asleep -- don't bother him.

KURTZ

I'm awake.

KURTZ

(continuing)

You. Get out.

KURTZ

(continuing; suddenly)

I said get the fuck out !

(to himself)

I'm going to kill the little

weirdo myself tomorrow.

(he shows some pain

when moving his

midsection)

He s only stayed alive this long

because he's a good orderly and

medic. He knows how to use a

hypodermic.

WILLARD

You're gonna get hit tonight,

bad -- a whole regiment of NVA

regulars.

KURTZ

That's right, the little gook-

pricks. But they are noble

little gook-pricks, noble.

Because they fight with their

guts, like animals. And for an

idea !

with ingenious machines and

fire, like Gods, and for nothing.

But I'll call in a major blotto

airstrike tonight. We'll have

ourselves a helluva airstrike

tonight, a lightshow. How do

you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby

Light My Fire...'

KURTZ

(continuing)

Do you?

WILLARD

Yeah, I like it...

KURTZ

I

love

WILLARD

You've gone crazy.

KURTZ

(angrily)

No. My thinking is clear.

(calmly)

But my soul has gone mad.

KURTZ

My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !

CHEF

(muttering)

Kill him -- come on, why don't

you kill him

NIGHT

KURTZ

(in pain)

Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.

KURTZ

(continuing; looking

up in pain)

You see how stupid it would have

been to blow out my brains? I'm

dying from the gut anyway.

KURTZ

(continuing)

No -- I don't want to sleep.

I want to think. Water. Give

me water.

WILLARD

You can't have water after

morphine.

KURTZ

Still playing by the rules.

(almost

affectionately)

You're a damn good kiler.

WILLARD

(still holding the

second morphine)

How's the pain?

KURTZ

How's yours?

WILLARD

I can handle it.

KURTZ

Pain is easy to handle -- but

nobility.. the nobility of a

man is judged by how much Truth

he can handle.

WILLARD

What Truth?

KURTZ

The truth that you were sent

here to murder me, ans so far

you haven't done it. And do

you know why?

(looks at him)

Yes, you know why.

(he looks)

Your mission makes about as much

sense as those idiots who sent

you on it.

Asshole

How long does it take you to

figure out that nobody knows

what they're doing here.

Except me.

KURTZ

(continuing)

Gimme water.

WILLARD

No water.

KURTZ

You know what you're doing?

You are interfering with my

plans

KURTZ

(continuing)

This water's got Moonby's acid

in it --

KURTZ

Drink it -- drink it for tonight.

Think of it. A whole regiment

War. Total war -- war like you've

never known it. It's beautiful

CHEF

Lance -- the fucker's not gonna

do it.

KURTZ

Goddamn -- You've gotta dig

napalm on Speed, too. It's

spectacular, you'll see.

KURTZ

Look into the jungle. You can't --

it's too terrible. You have to

smear yourself with warpaint to

look at it -- you have to be a

cannibal.

(whispered)

That's why warpaint was invented.

Then it becomes

How did we get here?

KURTZ

Because of all the things we do,

the thing we do best -- is

lie

WILLARD

I think think a lie stinks.

KURTZ

Oh Captain, that is so true.

WILLARD

Stinks. I could never figure --

(he drinks from

the canteen)

I could never figure how they

can teach boys how to bomb villages

with napalm -- and not let them

write the word 'fuck' on their

airplanes.

KURTZ

(angrily)

You could never figure it because

it doesn't make sense.

WILLARD

Fuck no.

KURTZ

I'll tell you what makes sense !

White Phosphorus

Napalm

we want.

We'll exterminate the fuckers !

WILLARD

Yeah.

WILLARD (V.O.)

... Don't remember a lot about my

rehabilitation... but I was sent

back to the world before the fall

of Saigon...

WILLARD

I never answered questions about

Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his

unimportant papers -- but for the

most part I saved everything.

There were other letters, personal

ones written earlier to his wife.

I brought them to het. I watched

the fall of Saigon on television

in a bar in Alameda...

WILLARD

Hi.

KURTZ'S WIFE

Come in, Captain Willard.

KURTZ'S WIFE

Can I get anything for you?

KURTZ'S WIFE

(continuing)

Did you know him very well?

WILLARD

You get to know each other pretty

well out there.

KURTZ'S WIFE

And you admired him?

WILLARD

He was a remarkable man. It was

impossible not to --

KURTZ'S WIFE

Love him... Yes, it is true.

That's the hard part for me... I

knew him better than anyone ... I

knew him best.

WILLARD

You knew him best.

KURTZ'S WIFE

You were his friend... You must

have been, if he had given you

this...

(the packet)

If he sent you to his home. He

was the best this country had --

he was --

WILLARD

Yes, I know...

KURTZ'S WIFE

I'll never get over it -- But

I'll always remember him...

WILLARD

Both of us...

KURTZ'S WIFE

Men looked up to him...

(she loses herself

in a thought)

He died as he lived...

WILLARD

His death was -- yes, he died as

he lived.

KURTZ'S WIFE

Were you with him, when...

WILLARD

Yes I was... He said his last

words to me.

KURTZ'S WIFE

What were they?

KURTZ'S WIFE

Tell me.

KURTZ'S WIFE

Tell me what he said.

KURTZ (V.O.)

The horror ! The horror !

WILLARD

He spoke of you, ma'am.

DISSOLVE TO:

FADE OUT.

THE  END
