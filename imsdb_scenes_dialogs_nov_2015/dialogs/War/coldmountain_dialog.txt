"COLD MOUNTAIN"

Anthony Minghella

Based On The Novel "Cold Mountain"

by

Charles Frazier

SWIMMERS VOICE (V.O.)

You will be lonely. You will howl

like a dog as you walk alone. You

will carry dog shit cupped in your

hands. You will be smeared with dog

shit. Your spirit will wane and

dwindle to blue, the colour of

despair...

SWIMMER

...This is your path. There is no

other. That's a curse you can use on

the Yankee before battle.

INMAN

And that works?

SWIMMER

You have to say it in Cherokee.

INMAN

You said it to me in Cherokee.

SWIMMER

So keep your head still.

INMAN

(to Swimmer)

Anyway, there won't be any war. And

if there is, they say it won't last

a week.

END OF CREDITS AND FADE TO:

ROURKE

Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys

keep store hours. They ain't open

yet.

BUTCHER

That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him!

ROURKE

I'm not firing, start the damn war

off.

ROURKE

That's my rabbit!

BUTCHER

That was something! That's hell and

we've been there! Kicked old Nick's

asshole.

BUTCHER

You got a charge?

STOBROD

That's gold in his mouth he got no

need for.

(shrugs)

We take his boots.

OAKLEY

I got a few. You saw?

INMAN

I saw.

OAKLEY

I know you don't recognise me. I'm

Mo Oakley's boy.

(Inman finds this

incredible)

It's okay. I was thirteen when you

all left. Am I going to die?

OAKLEY

I'd like to hear some music while I

go.

STOBROD

What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's

one I play.

OAKLEY

Play me something sweet. Like a girl's

waiting for me.

OAKLEY

Play me something like there's nothing

to fear from a merciful Lord.

INMAN

(to Stobrod)

You heard him.

STOBROD

(nervous)

I only know a couple of tunes.

OAKLEY

Like when you're thirsty up at

Bishop's Creek and the water is so

cool.

OAKLEY

I'm reaching Cold Mountain before

you.

OFFICER

Don't get up, soldier. You are

mentioned tonight in my report. You

are a credit to the Highlands, to

North Carolina and to the Cause.

INMAN

(tight)

Do you have news, sir, on my

application for transfer?

OFFICER

I know. A bloody day. It's what our

General said: Good thing war is so

terrible else a man might end up

liking it too much.

INMAN

Sir. It was my understanding the

medical corps was desperate for

volunteers.

OFFICER

Right now, soldier, it's me who is

in need of volunteers. There's a

dozen Yankees in that stand of trees

between us. Stuck there from the

retreat. Come daylight they can shoot

us down for sport.

SALLY

(to Ada, as Monroe

moves off)

Ada, how are you settling in? Are

you liking the farm?

ADA

Very much. It's beautiful country.

SALLY

So listen -- if you would say hello

to one of these fools, I'll get a

field cleared this weekend.

ADA

Anyone? Like a forfeit?

SALLY

(pointing at Inman

who immediately looks

away)

No. Him in particular, up in the

rafters. Been pressing me all morning.

ROURKE

(hammering)

I call this nail: Northern Aggression.

(hammering)

I call this nail: a free nigger.

BUTCHER

Show some respect -- these nails are

making a church.

ROURKE

(hammering)

I call this nail: respect the church.

ADA

Hello.

ADA

I'm Ada Monroe.

INMAN

I'm Inman.

ADA

Inman?

INMAN

W. P. Inman.

ADA

W. P. Inman.

INMAN

Repeating a thing doesn't improve

it.

(shrugs)

People call me Inman.

ADA

If you were to take a glass of

lemonade your friends might stop

staring. Inman.

INMAN

They're not my friends.

INMAN

Thank you.

ADA

And what do you do?

INMAN

I work wood. Got a piece of land.

Mostly work wood.

ADA

Clear fields?

INMAN

(uncomfortable)

I can clear a field.

ADA

So, was there something in particular

you wished to say to me?

INMAN

(thinks about it)

Not that comes to me.

(hands back the glass)

I'll say thank you for the lemonade.

ROURKE

Esco loves the Yankees.

ESCO

I prefer a Yankee to a halfwit.

ESCO

What is it you think you'd be fighting

for?

ROURKE

The South.

ESCO

And what's that when it's at home?

ACTON

Pop, you causing trouble?

ESCO

No.

ELLIS

That means yes.

ESCO

You cut the wood, you carry the water

for good old King Cotton. Now you

want to fight for him. Somebody has

to explain it to me.

ACTON

(to Rourke and the

others)

Don't even try.

BUTCHER

How's the lemonade? Sweet?

SALLY

That's a fine looking thing.

ADA

I've been missing it.

SALLY

Thank you, by the way.

(from Ada's quizzical

look)

Inman's down in the bottom field,

clearing his debt.

ADA

Oh dear. And then he had nothing to

say.

SALLY

He was happy.

ADA

Really?

SALLY

Are men so different in Charleston?

ADA

Men? I don't know. I don't even know

what a woman should be like. In

Charleston I was called a thistle,

twice, by two different men. Both of

them -- they were hunting for a

simile, what was I like -- and thistle

came right to them.

SALLY

If you're saying you might like him,

why not go down and say hello.

MONROE

Esco, our friends there --

(indicating Teague

and co.)

-- they helped build the Chapel?

ESCO

That's Teague and his boys. I'd

recommend you kick them out except a

man don't kick a snake. One time the

Teague family owned the whole of

Cold Mountain. My farm, your farm,

all belonged to his grand-daddy.

Teague wanted this place bad. You

got it. He's here sniffing out an

advantage.

MONROE

There's no advantage here, but to

celebrate a job well done. Cheers --

(he raises his glass)

-- and thank you.

ADA

Were you planning to come inside?

INMAN

I'm wetter than a fish.

ADA

There's a good fire going.

INMAN

I'm all right.

ADA

Somebody said you were enlisting.

(no response)

Are you?

INMAN

If there's a war we'll all fight.

ADA

(unimpressed)

If there's a mountain we'll all climb,

if there's an ocean we'll all drown.

INMAN

Call a thing a war makes it a

challenge to some men.

ADA

Did you get a picture made?

INMAN

Say again.

ADA

A tintype, with your gun and your

courage on display.

INMAN

You're laughing at me.

ADA

I don't know you.

INMAN

You're always carrying a tray.

ADA

I'm taking a drink over to the negroes

in the barn.

INMAN

(takes the tray)

I'll do that. I can't get much wetter.

MONROE

Mr. Inman.

INMAN

Reverend.

MONROE

What can I do for you?

INMAN

I have some sheet music. Belonged to

my father. No use to me.

MONROE

You must come in.

INMAN

I should probably get along.

ADA

Mr. Inman is more comfortable

outdoors. Perhaps we might take a

walk.

MONROE

A splendid idea.

MONROE

(expansive)

I want to get sheep into this field.

A big field doesn't look right without

sheep. You're a lucky fellow, Mr.

Inman, you've had this view all your

life.

INMAN

I think so.

MONROE

It's a special view. I dragged my

poor daughter to Cold Mountain from

Charleston because of my Doctors --

they say my heart is weak -- so the

air's meant to do me good. But it's

the view I think heals.

MONROE

I have to get on my visits. Can I

offer you a ride back into town?

ADA

Well, you have your war.

TEAGUE

Those who follow Lincoln, or preach

abolition, best keep one eye open

when they're sleeping, Old Bogey Man

might get you!

INMAN

Are you the law all of a sudden?

TEAGUE

That's right, son. Home Guard for

Haywood County. I'm the law from

today. You all go fight now. We'll

watch your sweethearts.

INMAN

You might be safer back in Charleston.

ADA

But then who'll be waiting for you?

INMAN

I'm going to walk back inside the

Chapel.

MONROE

Did you want a quiet word?

INMAN

Just some quiet.

MONROE

Of course Ada.

MONROE

(of his appointment)

I'll daresay Dr. O'Brien'll want to

do a test or two.

ADA

And then there'll be a coffee or

two, a brandy or two...

ADA

I found you this book. William

Bartram. They tell me it's good. I

think he writes about these parts,

the author, so...

ADA

And this...

(hands it to him)

I'm not smiling in it. I don't know

how to do that, hold a smile, so now

I'm solemn...

INMAN

Ada...

ADA

What?

ROURKE

Let's go!

INMAN

I'm not dying.

STOBROD

(to Pangle)

What'd he say?

PANGLE

Says he ain't about to die.

STOBROD

(to Inman)

Truth to tell they say you are,

Soldier. We'll meet again, in the

better world.

TEAGUE

My condolences to you all.

(he considers the

slave)

Keep an eye on the negro. They want

what the white man got -- all of you

watch out your brave boys give their

lives to war and meantime your slaves

carry murder, rape and arson to your

firesides.

MONROE

The only slaves within twenty miles

labor on my farm. They're good

Christians and I'll vouchsafe for

them.

ADA

What?

MONROE

You're looking -- at this moment, I

don't know why -- you're looking

exactly like your mother.

ADA

Every time you see the doctor you

get melancholy.

MONROE

He listens to my heart and I get

emotional.

ADA

He gives you alcohol and you get

emotional.

MONROE

We commiserate about the folly of

this terrible war.

(they ride in silence)

Do you worry when there's no word

from him?

(no response)

From Mr. Inman?

ADA

Yes. But then I've tried counting

the number of words which passed

between Mr. Inman and me.

(looking ahead, seeing

smoke)

Is that a bonfire? So close to the

barns.

ADA

What's going on?

MONROE

(shouting at the

disappearing slaves)

Hey! Stop there! Hey!

MONROE

Dear God.

ADA

No, Daddy, it's not real.

MONROE

(appalled)

What is wrong with us all?

ADA

I'll get help.

(shouting over her

shoulder)

Keep away from the flames.

DOCTOR

Most of these men will be dead by

the morning or, if they're stubborn,

by nightfall. I have other men outside

in the quadrangle waiting for the

beds.

DOCTOR

So, any kind word will be a blessing.

DOCTOR

It's the heat. I'm sorry. They rot.

DOCTOR

Don't pray. If they're not God fearing

you can stir up a hornet's nest.

MRS. MORGAN

I'm sorry, you want water?

INMAN

Pigeon River. Little East Fork.

MRS. MORGAN

I'm sorry. I don't know what he's

saying.

DOCTOR

They ramble. Names of loved ones.

MRS. MORGAN

(listening to Inman)

Pigeon River. Is that a place? Cold

Mountain?

DOCTOR

This man is dead.

MONROE

Thank you.

(staying her for grace)

For your Providence, Oh lord, we

thank you.

ADA

Amen. That was the last of the ham.

MONROE

It was delicious.

ADA

I have to learn how to cook.

MONROE

I was going to say something in

Chapel. Perhaps some of the womenfolk

will volunteer.

ADA

I can't have people coming here and

cooking for me!

MONROE

It's my fault. I should have raised

you less like a companion and more

like a young woman. I'm sorry.

ADA

I'm not sorry, but I don't know how

we'll get through another winter.

MONROE

Will you play me something? Something

peaceful while I look over my sermon.

ADA

(still playing)

Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with

you!

ADA

Daddy, come inside before you drown!

ADA (V.O.)

Dear Mr. Inman...

MRS. MORGAN

It's come to you by way of Virginia.

MRS. MORGAN

It's not too recent -- written this

past winter. I'm afraid I can't read

who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman,

ADA (V.O.)

-- I'm still waiting, as I promised

I would, but I find myself alone and

at the end of my wits --

MRS. MORGAN

-- at the end of my wits, so now I

say to you, plain as I can, come

back to me. Come back to me is my

request.

(can't read the next

bit)

Then something I can't read,

something, come back to me.

OFFICIAL (O.S.)

By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor

of this great state of North Carolina:

any soldier turned deserter is guilty

of treason and shall be hunted down

like a dog.

OFFICIAL

-- Any man takes in a deserter is

likewise guilty of treason.

OFFICIAL

The Home Guard is powered to enter

any place it sees fit, without notice

or constraint. Names of all deserters

will be posted in every town,

published in every newspaper.

ADA

Is there a letter for me?

MRS. CASTLEREAGH

Nothing -- we're getting no post

through at all -- although if you

slip out back the material you ordered

has arrived.

MRS. CASTLEREAGH

If folks knew I was taking deliveries

from the North.

ADA

I know. Thank you so much.

MRS. CASTLEREAGH

The sooner we lose this war the

better. Already one boy gone, another

with his leg took off at the knee.

That's enough.

ADA

What do you hear?

MRS. CASTLEREAGH

All I know is they say not one boy

in ten from these mountains is coming

home again and most of them are

deserters.

TEAGUE

It's taken me too long, but I've

come to pay my respects.

ADA

Thank you.

TEAGUE

(hands over the rabbits)

I reckoned you might need fattening

up.

TEAGUE

This house must bring bad luck. Killed

my granddaddy to lose it, then my

daddy died on account of not having

it, then your daddy died on account

of getting it. We should burn it

down.

ADA

Didn't somebody try?

TEAGUE

Lot to manage without help. Need a

hand with that pump?

ADA

No.

TEAGUE

I'm happy to volunteer.

ADA

But not to volunteer for the war?

TEAGUE

The war? I wanted to go. But you

know: too old, too literate. Plus I

got no spleen. Lost it from a horse's

kick.

ADA

You've got no spleen.

TEAGUE

That's the thing about an organ. You

don't know you need it till you lost

it.

(suddenly busy with a

bayonet)

I want to clear this path. I can

just as soon do it and talk as stand

around and talk. Then you can say

men beat a path to your door.

ADA

I'd really prefer it if you didn't

do that.

TEAGUE

Would you rather I did my job?

(scything at the path)

See if there's any material I should

confiscate. For the war effort.

ADA

I was raised in the good manners of

the South where a gentleman doesn't

enter a house with a woman alone.

TEAGUE

(now he's at the pump)

Good manners didn't quite make it to

these mountains. If it don't yield

meat, or you can't sit on it, or

suck on it...

(he gets the pump

going, water pours

out)

And you're sleeping all right? These

cold dark nights?

ADA

I'm sleeping fine.

TEAGUE

It's going to be a long hard winter.

ADA (V.O.)

Should I imagine you are dead and,

that it is to your spirit I am

writing? No word from you in all

this time. If you receive this please

know I am here and warring, too,

with a faint heart.

SALLY

Ada! Ada, It's Sally.

ESCO

Will you look at the state of this

place!

SALLY

Poor soul. She's got nobody and

nothing and three hundred acres of

misery.

BLIND MAN

Getting better all the time.

INMAN

Seems that way.

BLIND MAN

I wouldn't hurry. War's almost done.

INMAN

Where'd you take your wound?

BLIND MAN

Before I was born. Never saw a thing

in this world, not a tree a gun or a

woman. Though I put my hand on all

three. Couple of things I felt back

there I'd sure liked to have had a

long look at.

INMAN

What would you give for that? To

have your eyeballs back for ten

minutes?

BLIND MAN

Ten minutes! Wouldn't give an Indian

head cent. I fear it might turn me

hateful.

INMAN

That's sure what seeing's done to

me.

BLIND MAN

That ain't the way I meant it. You

said ten minutes. It's having a thing

and then the loss I'm talking about.

INMAN

Then we don't agree. There's not

much I wouldn't give for ten minutes

of someplace.

BLIND MAN

Someplace or someone.

INMAN

Same difference.

BLIND MAN

You watch yourself. They're shooting

men who take themselves a walk.

BARBER

Next.

BARBER

(nervous)

I'll cut your hair, but I ain't about

to shave you. That thing opens up,

your head's liable to falloff.

SALLY (V.O.)

Ada...

SALLY

You're skinny as a whippet, girl --

you're coming indoors with me.

ADA

I can't. I'm not -- I need to clean

some clothes.

SALLY

Great God, you ever looked at my

husband! I can't get him to wear

decent Church clothes Christmas

morning. Hang on to me, the wind'll

blow you over.

SALLY

Don't go back to that dark house.

There's a bed here, least till our

boys get home.

ESCO

That your daddy's coat?

ADA

I was saying to Sally, I wasn't

expecting to be visiting, so...

ESCO

Don't suit you.

ESCO

I can't get up to your place this

week.

(of Sally)

She's mad at me --

ADA

I don't expect -

ESCO

-- more than I can do to keep this

place half-managed. I'm ready-to

stop, I tell you. I just want to sit

on my porch with Sal, watch my boys

in the field, holler good job! every

hour or so.

SALLY

What about your people in Charleston?

ADA

There are no people. And no money.

My father had some bonds and

investments. They're worthless now,

of course, the war has... they're

not worth anything.

(they look at each

other)

I love it here. In spite of

everything.

ESCO

And waiting on a feller.

ESCO

Look down our well.

(Sally's disgusted

with him)

She should! Look down our well with

a mirror, you'll see the future.

S'what they say.

(to Sally)

You do it! Don't make that face.

SALLY

I know it ain't rightly Christian,

but it's what folks do, like when

they dangle a needle over the belly

to see if you're carrying a boy or a

girl.

ADA

What kind of mirror?

ESCO

See anything?

ADA

I don't know.

SALLY

I tried many a time, never saw a

dickybird.

SALLY

You all right?

ADA (V.O.)

Yesterday I found myself crouched

over a well like a mad woman, which

I suppose I have become

ADA (V.O.)

-- and staring down into its secrets,

I thought I saw you there, walking

back to me --

ADA (V.O.)

-- or wished I did.

RUBY (O.S.)

That cow wants milking.

RUBY

If that letter ain't urgent, the cow

is -- is what I'm saying.

ADA

I don't know you.

RUBY

Old Lady Swanger says you need some

help. Here I am.

ADA

I need help, I need, I do need help,

but I need a laborer -- there's

plowing and rough work and -- I think

there's been a misunderstanding.

RUBY

What's the rake for?

ADA

The rake?

RUBY

Ain't for gardening, that's for sure.

Number one -- you got a horse I can

plow all day. I'm a worker. Number

two there's no man better than me

cause there's no man around who ain't

old or full of mischief. I know your

plight.

ADA

My plight?

RUBY

Am I hard to hear cause you keep

repeating everything. I'm not looking

for money, never cared for it and

now it ain't worth nothing. I expect

to board and eat at the same table.

I'm not a servant. Do you get my

meaning?

ADA

You're not a servant.

RUBY

People'll have to empty their own

night jars, that's my point.

ADA

Right.

RUBY

And I'm not planning to work while

you watch neither.

ADA

Right.

RUBY

Is that a yes or a no?

ADA

(looks at Ruby)

Yes.

RUBY

There's half the day yet. Let's make

a start. My name's Ruby. I know your

name.

ADA

The rake: there's a rooster devil,

I'm sure of it. He's Lucifer himself.

I go near him he's at me with his

spurs.

RUBY

I despise a flogging rooster. Where

is he?

RUBY

Let's put him in a pot.

INMAN

Hey!

(they stop, turn)

I'd pay a dollar for an egg. A piece

of cheese.

RUBY

Ada? Ada? You up?

ADA

Yes.

(opening her eyes)

It's still dark.

RUBY

Tell the cows that. It's late.

ADA

I have to eat something.

RUBY

Then you have to get up earlier.

(at Ada's book)

What's that?

ADA

A novel.

RUBY

(heading outside)

You want to carry a book carry one

you can write in --

RUBY

-- we got our own story. Called Black

Cove Farm: a catastrophe.

RUBY

I can spell it, too. C-a-t-a-s-t-r-o-

phe. Learned the same place you did,

in the schoolroom. That's one of the

first words they taught me. Ruby

Thewes, you are a ca-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h-

e...

RUBY

You mucking out?

RUBY

Three years I was in school before

my daddy -- saying God rest his soul

is like wishing him what he had in

life, cause he lived to rest, he was

born tired -- before my daddy decided

there was better use for my backside

than have it sat all day in front of

a blackboard.

RUBY

Number One -- layout a winter garden

for cool season crops: turnips,

onions, cabbage, greens.

RUBY

Number Two: patch the shingles on

the barn roof. Do we have a maul and

froe?

ADA

(writing, holding the

ladder)

Maul?

RUBY

M-a-u-l.

ADA

I have no idea.

RUBY

Number three: clay crocks for

preserves. Tomatoes. Beans. Jams.

RUBY

Clear and turn this field. No harm

done letting it go fallow, now we'll

do well.

RUBY

Number fifteen

ADA

Sixteen.

RUBY

Number sixteen: let's get a martin

colony going in the Gourd House.

Keep away crows. You got one thing

in abundance on this farm and that's

crows.

ADA

What's a Gourd House?

RUBY

There's survival. On them trees.

(turns to an exhausted

Ada)

You got a cider press or would that

be wishing on a blessing?

ADA

Actually, yes, I think we do.

INMAN

Don't let go. Just back up, nice and

steady, do this all in reverse, you're

going to end up with her draped back

over your animal.

VEASEY

Don't pull that trigger. I am a man

of God.

INMAN

I've killed several of them.

VEASEY

I mean I am God's minister.

INMAN

What part of God's business is

throwing a woman down a gorge.

VEASEY

A slave woman, can you see that in

this light? She's black as a bucket

of tar.

INMAN

Is she dead?

VEASEY

Drugged her. Like you would a

butterfly. And I care for her, that's

the heartbreak of it.

VEASEY

She's got my bastard in her belly.

What kind of pistol is that I never

saw the like of it?

VEASEY

I'm begging you. It's better you

blowout my brains than return me to

this place.

INMAN

Where does she live?

VEASEY

In our house. She sleeps in our

kitchen. You don't know me, friend,

but the good Lord punished me with

want. I am all appetite. That's all

I do all day is want: food, the female

parts...

INMAN

Shut your mouth. I don't want a sermon

every time I ask a question.

INMAN

This your place?

VEASEY

Dear God of misery.

INMAN

You're going to put her back where

she sleeps.

VEASEY

I do that the Members will lynch me.

Consorting with a nigger, adultery,

siring a bastard while serving as

their preacher. We're a strict

congregation we've churched men for

picking up a fiddle on the sabbath.

INMAN

So you reckoned to kill her.

VEASEY

There's a back door. Have pity.

VEASEY

(whispering)

Thank you. I was going to do a

grievous wrong.

VESEY

You tasted dark meat? Sweet as

liquorice. I think I should go back

up to my wife. She wakes at the

slightest noise.

INMAN

You find me some paper and a pen.

VEASEY

You're not entitled to judge me!

You're nothing but an outlier, plain

as daylight!

RUBY

Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in

the woods?

ADA

No. What? No. We bought our hams.

RUBY

There's a world more to a hog than

the two hams! Lard, for example,

we'll need plenty --

RUBY

The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's

laundry.

(marching out)

I can feel you shutting your eyes.

RUBY

What's this wood?

ADA

I don't know. Locust?

RUBY

Where's North?

ADA

North is, North is --

RUBY

Name me three herbs growing wild on

this farm.

ADA

(frustrated with Ruby

and with herself)

I can't! I can't! All right? I can

talk about farming in Latin. Will

that do? I can read French. I know

Harmony and Counterpoint. I know my

Bible. I can name the principal rivers

of Europe, but don't ask me to name

one stream in this county. I can

embroider, but I can't darn, I can

arrange cut flowers, but I can't

grow them. If a thing has a function,

if I might do something with it, it

wasn't considered suitable.

RUBY

Why?

ADA

Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty

much everything to do with me.

ADA

This fence is about the first thing

I've ever done that'll produce an

actual result.

RUBY

So you never wrapped your legs around

this Inman?

FERRYGIRL

For five dollars I wouldn't give a

parched man a dipper of this

riverwater.

INMAN

Sign says ferry, five dollars.

FERRYGIRL

This look like a ferry? My Daddy's

dead, or gone off to the Federals,

don't matter which. I'm the way across

now.

INMAN

What's the name of this thing?

FERRYGIRL

Nothing but the mighty Cape Fear

River, is all.

FERRYGIRL

Nobody crosses this water unless

they're running from someplace. Some

cross one way, some the other: makes

no difference, they're all running.

You want to wait for your friends?

INMAN

I can give you thirty dollars script.

FERRYGIRL

Let's go.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey! Hey! Wait!

VEASEY

Keep going. We're both in trouble.

INMAN

No. Get out.

VEASEY

It's Homeguard. Made me tell them

all about you.

INMAN

I should have shot you when I had

the chance.

VEASEY

I'm not looking for revenge, by the

way. For what you did to me. No, I'm

a Pilgrim now, like you, traveling

the road, paying our dues, relying

on the kindness of strangers.

INMAN

You're nothing like me and the last

thing I want right now is a

conversation.

VEASEY

(to Ferrygirl)

You recall Job in the scriptures? I

will give free utterance to my

complaint. I will speak in the

bitterness of my soul. That's our

friend here...

(to Inman)

They cut off my hair. Which was hard.

I was vain about my hair.

(to Ferrygirl)

I had good curls. But I deserved it.

I'm the Reverend Veasey. Have I seen

you in church?

FERRYGIRL

I'm saving for a cowhide, and when I

get it I aim to get a saddle made,

and when I get me a saddle I'll save

for a horse, and when I got a horse

I'll throw on the saddle, and then

you won't see my sorry ass round

this swamp again.

VEASEY

What's that?

FERRYGIRL

Catfish. 'gator. Keep your hand in

the boat. Already looks like some

critter chewed his neck.

(she looks at Inman)

Thirty more dollars, we can go to

the cabin. I'll pull this dress over

my head.

VEASEY

(excited)

Have we got thirty dollars?

VEASEY

You okay?

INMAN

Jesus, god!

VEASEY

I figure that righteous, given our

history. Otherwise I'd bear a grudge

on our journey.

INMAN

There's nowhere I'm going with you

except to Hellfire!

ADA

Agricola poetis viam non monstrat.

RUBY

Which means?

ADA

The farmer does not point out the

road to a poet.

RUBY

Which means? Should be the other way

round

ADA

Which means, I suppose, which means

the poet should know where he's going.

RUBY

(of Ada's hairdressing)

It's no wonder you're helpless and

hopeless if it takes this long to

fix your hair.

(of the Latin)

Say some more.

ADA

Terra mutata non mutat mores.

(can't believe she

knows all these

phrases by heart)

It's appalling what's in my head.

RUBY

It's appalling what's in my head?

ADA

No, it means: A change of place does

not change a character.

RUBY

Well that's surely true even in

English.

ADA

You can keep those earrings.

RUBY

We can't keep anything.

ADA

I have to keep the bangles. They

were my mother's.

RUBY

Well that's all. The rest is for

trading. Else they can bury you in

your finery.

ADA

(of her hair)

You're done.

RUBY

Good God! Okay.

ADA

I like it.

RUBY

Takes two minutes. That's what I

like.

RUBY

How much do you love that piano?

RUBY

We're careful we'll get through the

winter now. I made old man Roy give

me ten of those sheep on account of

I said they were so small put together

they were no bigger than six proper

sheep.

ADA

My father always wanted sheep on

this land.

RUBY

I'm sorry you had to lose your piano.

I cut off my hair once, for money.

My daddy got two dollars for it.

Made a wig for a rich feller in

Raleigh.

RUBY

Stobrod called himself a musician --

my daddy -- he could play six tune

on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead

at Petersburg. I was like his goat

or some creature tethered to a post.

He left me once, up the mountains. I

was eight. He was gone over two weeks.

ADA

Oh Ruby.

RUBY

(defiant)

I was all right! He'd walk forty

miles for liquor and not forty inches

for kindness.

ADA

And your mother?

RUBY

Never met her. We're the same in

that regard. He said she was -- he

told me a thousand stories -- she

was a wolf or an indian or a donkey.

Don't say much for him, except you

know he'd be fast to work up a sweat

on a tree if he thought there was

pleasure in it.

RUBY

There's cows to milk.

VEASEY

Used to be as regular as morning

prayers. Matter of fact I could set

my watch by my bowels. That beeswax

you fed me, day before yesterday, it

stops a man up. Open my gut now they'd

find turds stacked up like little

black twigs.

VEASEY

Hey! Look at this!

(flexing it)

This is a good saw.

INMAN

(getting up)

It's not yours. You take it, you

make us another enemy. You're a

Christian -- don' t you know your

commandments?

VEASEY

You'll find the good Lord very

flexible on the subject of property.

We could do a lot with this saw...

VEASEY

Why you in such a hurry the whole

time?

(no answer)

Hurry or slow the destination is

always the same. It's only the journey

that is different. That's either in

the Good Book or I made it up.

VEASEY

Good day to you!

JUNIOR

My old bull, wandered off and died

in this here creek. Fouled up our

water is how I found it.

VEASEY

This is a tricky one.

VEASEY

The name for the Bull's member is a

tassel. I learned that and never

forgot it.

JUNIOR

Reckon I need a train of mules.

VEASEY

(walking away)

I'm getting an idea. My saw is the

remedy. Let's saw up some wood and

make levers.

INMAN

Then what?

VEASEY

Lever him out. This'll work!

JUNIOR

Where you two sports heading?

INMAN

(inscrutable)

I don't know where he's heading. I'm

going down the road. And I got a

good way to go before nightfall.

JUNIOR

(acknowledging his

attitude)

Charitable of you to make a stop.

Ain't for me to be curious.

VEASEY

(emerges from the

woods)

How do you work this damn thing?

INMAN

(to Veasey)

Give me that saw.

(to Junior)

Come on.

INMAN

Let's do this in chapters.

INMAN

You might want to leave off that

water for a day or two.

JUNIOR

There'll be a tang, I'd imagine.

JUNIOR

There's my place. Hope you can stomach

a yard chock-full of females. Brought

my woman home, she showed up with

her three so-called sisters and their

brats. The noise in that place is

something awful. It's why I go

hunting.

VEASEY

(considering the wild

camber)

Looks a bit crooked.

JUNIOR

It is on a bit of a tilt. Them

females. They all roll down one end

each night!

VEASEY

-- Roll me over!

JUNIOR

-- In the clover

VEASEY

One good fart -- that'll tip over!

VEASEY

Oh God of my God! Hallelujah!

Hallelujah!

JUNIOR

What's up?

VEASEY

The Israelites! The tribes of Israel

are about to flee from the banks of

Egypt! Hallelujah!

INMAN

(explaining to Junior)

He's got a shit coming on. It's

overdue.

JUNIOR

(bewildered)

And he's a Preacher? Like a Christian?

INMAN

Like a Christian.

JUNIOR

Good God.

JUNIOR

These two boys is stopping for supper.

They're on the road to Atonement.

VEASEY

Atonement is not a place.

JUNIOR

So what is it when it's at home?

VEASEY

Those are fine examples of the female.

JUNIOR

Take them all and leave the saw. Be

a sight more use.

SHYLA

(reappearing)

If they want to get in a tub there's

an hour before food.

JUNIOR

They love to scrub a man.

(to Shyla)

Put the water on the boil.

(back to the men)

It's my liquor, gets their titties

swinging.

VEASEY

(excited)

God damn!

(to Inman)

I was right about sheep droppings

those stools -- like rock hard. Quite

astonishing.

SHYLA

That's battered flesh.

(of his neck wound)

I could work a finger in there.

VEASEY

He's a hero. Took that wound at

Petersburg.

INMAN

He doesn't know what I am.

(uncomfortable with

her stare)

Thanks.

SHYLA

(to Veasey)

He's shy, ain't he?

VEASEY

Wait up a few minutes, I'll be in

that tub, then we'll see who's a shy

one.

SHYLA

I want to poke my thumb in his holes.

DOLLY

Lila says supper's up.

LILA

Hey!

JUNIOR

He's gone now. Look! His eyes have

gone.

INMAN

(vaguely, drunk)

What?

VEASEY

Dolly?

DOLLY

S'me.

VEASEY

Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. That's a

poem. That's a poem.

VEASEY

Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae

(but he can' t summon

it)

Da-da da-da da-da dae...

(vague)

...there's a poem there.

JUNIOR

I'm leaving soon as I'm full.

VEASEY

Really. Goodbye.

JUNIOR

Got a bunch of traps needs visiting.

I'll be back tomorrow, before dark.

You'll still be here?

VEASEY

That's my fervent prayer.

JUNIOR

My house is your house.

INMAN

(suddenly)

Like to wash their hands and pray.

VEASEY

Say again?

INMAN

Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae.

VEASEY

That's Job. Don't say much but even

liquored up there's a preacher in

him.

INMAN

I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and

miles to go before sunset.

(head spinning)

I'll just quickly lie down.

VEASEY

I'm heading for that smokehouse and

I'm ready to be washed clean of my

dirt.

JUNIOR

You go tend to him.

(to Lila)

I'll be seeing you.

DOLLY

Come on you -- get!

LILA

He's mine. You can go rub yourself

off on the Preacher.

(of Inman)

Gonna make him hug me till I grunt.

LILA

Hey!

LILA

(kneeling down to him)

You want to see what Mamma's got for

you?

LILA

That's good. Ain't that sweet?

LILA

You just get on and ride me all the

way to China.

LILA

You shy? You need a hand?

(goes to his buttons)

Let's have a look see what we can

muster.

JUNIOR

You little bitch! Look at you! Cover

yourself up!

VEASEY

I had a special prayer you'd come

visit.

SALLY

Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes! Look at

you both!

RUBY

Look at us both what?

SALLY

Like a coupla scarecrows after a

thunderstorm.

RUBY

We need a scarecrow, birds eating up

half our winter garden.

ADA

Sally's right. We should both stop

toiling and stand a while with our

arms stretch out. I'll volunteer.

RUBY

We got something for you.

ADA

For all your kindness. Coffee. And a

pie.

RUBY

That's real coffee. It ain't hickory

and dirt.

SALLY

(taking the gifts)

Thank you both.

(of the pie)

Ruby, I look forward to this. We all

do. Esco and me.

RUBY

(grinning at Ada)

She made it.

ADA

I made it.

SALLY

Good God in Heaven.

RUBY

(by way of

recommendation)

I'm still alive.

RUBY

We'll be getting along.

SALLY

(nodding)

I know Esco's going to be real sorry

he missed you. You all take care.

RUBY

That strike you as odd?

ADA

What?

RUBY

Stood at her front door?

ADA

Sally?

RUBY

Number one -- I know that woman all

my life. I never stood outside her

house -- she'd invite a wolf inside

if it knocked on the door.

ADA

Perhaps, I don't know, perhaps she

was busy.

RUBY

Number two -- Old Man Swanger was

inside that house: I could smell his

pipe burning. Number three -- look

at these fields.

ADA

What about them?

RUBY

We came by here a week ago, they

were waist high in hay.

INMAN

He's dead.

INMAN

This man's dead!

VEASEY

Am I so altered that they don't see

me?

VEASEY

I christened that child.

SHEFFIELD

I'm looking to get out of this. They

drag us back to fight -- we're just

target practice for the Federal boys.

INMAN

You run, we're all running with you,

the lame and the stupid, of which we

number both.

SHEFFIELD

Either way we're fucked. Run or don't

run.

INMAN

Just give me some warning so I can

tell the guard -- I'm not getting

shot again for some cause I don't

believe in.

VEASEY

(mesmerized)

That's Rebecca. That's Rebecca.

(he hisses)

Rebecca!

REBECCA

Mas?

VEASEY

Is it well with you?

(Rebecca nods)

I've been repenting for what I did.

I've walked the road of atonement.

REBECCA

Your curls is all gone.

GUARD

Hey!

VEASEY

(holding his head, to

Rebecca)

God Bless you.

VEASEY

I'm with you. I got a baby coming.

INMAN

No!

BROWN

Get these sacks of shit under the

ground.

RUBY

Someone's been in the corncrib.

ADA

You sure?

RUBY

It's a coon or possum. Scratched out

a fist hole in the side. This place!

I'm telling you -- we grow, others

eat. I'll go into town, take the

last of the cider and trade for a

trap.

TEAGUE

What you looking to catch?

RUBY

What?

TEAGUE

With that trap.

RUBY

We got some critter stealing our

corn.

TEAGUE

Still but the two of you up there,

is it?

RUBY

You know it.

TEAGUE

When we get a cold night, camped

out, trying to keep the rule of law,

protecting girls like you from

Federals and deserters, that's a

thought warms us

(to his men)

ain't it? -- the two of you up there

on my Grand-daddy's farm, dressed in

men's clothes. Warms us right up.

What you got in the sacks?

(to the men)

Looks like human heads! Eh? Looks

like a bunch of heads. We got

competition!

SALLY

Ruby...

RUBY

I'm not stopping, Sally. I'm not

snooping neither. Just you should

know Teague and his boys are lurking

down by Pigeon River, the old mill.

SALLY

(after a beat)

You tell Ada that was a good pie.

MADDY

Mind that Billy, he's the jealous

kind.

MADDY

Pay no attention to me. What happened

to your head?

INMAN

Fighting.

MADDY

And your neck?

INMAN

Different fighting.

MADDY

You're the color of a cadaver. I'll

fix you. I can fix you up.

INMAN

(speaking of his spirit)

Mister -- you could fix me I'd be in

your everlasting debt.

MADDY

Debts, fighting -- them words don't

mean much round here. For the record,

I'm a female of the species.

RUBY

The hat's a nice touch.

RUBY

You're quiet.

ADA

I cried for my Daddy. I dressed up

the scarecrow in his suit and he

came back, his arms out, said you

never cried enough, you never cried

enough.

RUBY

Well now you did.

ADA

Then I thought, it's not my Daddy,

it's my sweetheart. I saw him once

that way, when I looked down Sally's

well. So I dressed the scarecrow in

the dress I wore the day he left. In

case his spirit flies over looking

out for me.

(of the vicious looking

trap)

That looks terrible.

ADA

Cabbages.

RUBY

I bargained like Lucifer. We can

make all kinds of good eating.

ADA

Such as?

RUBY

Cabbage. Slaw, sauerkraut, cabbage

soup, fried cabbage, stuffed

cabbage...

TEAGUE

Afternoon.

ESCO

Don't spread out. Why they spreading

out?

TEAGUE

I'm not spreading out. I'm sitting

here.

TEAGUE

Never knew a man worked in his field

with a shotgun.

ESCO

There's a war on.

TEAGUE

Got to watch out for the Bogey Man.

ESCO

Get off my land.

TEAGUE

Your boys come back.

ESCO

Ain't seen my boys in four years.

They're fighting other boys, not old

men and women.

TEAGUE

(to his men)

He means us. He's referring there to

us.

(to Esco)

So you won't care if we take a look

around?

ESCO

What I gotta give you? A chicken? A

lamb?

TEAGUE

(shrugs)

Sure.

ESCO

Right then.

TEAGUE

Thing is -- you got one barrel and

there's five of us. Not a fair fight.

BOSIE

Bogey Man! Bogey Man!

RUBY

What's that?

TEAGUE

You're harbouring deserters. I can

confiscate every animal on this farm,

every plate, every sheet, every little

pellet of chicken shit -- I can

confiscate your old lady's asshole,

so don't offer me a bird.

TEAGUE

(sharply)

Hey!

TEAGUE

You got your bait. Set it on the

hook.

RUBY

I can't get this damn thing off her.

ADA

(at the well, looking

down)

Dear Lord in heaven.

RUBY

Ada, I can't get this off her!

RUBY

What darling? What?

RUBY

She's saying don't bother.

ADA

Wait!

ADA

There's someone down there. I think

it's Esco.

RUBY

This world won't stand long. God

won't let it stand this way long.

INMAN

How long have I been sleeping?

MADDY

Not long enough.

INMAN

I can't stop here. I'm a deserter.

They find me here things could be

bad for you.

MADDY

What they going to do? Cut short my

young life? Sit down before you fall

down.

INMAN

How long you been up here?

MADDY

What year are we? '63?

INMAN

Last time I checked it was '64.

MADDY

I'd say twenty six years.

INMAN

Twenty six years!

MADDY

I could move on anytime. I've seen

most of the world anyway, Richmond

in the North, south almost to

Charleston. You're going somewhere

or you are somewhere, what's the

difference?

MADDY

I've learned a person can survive

off pretty much of a goat. I can't

abide a chicken, but a goat gives

you company and milk and cheese and

then, when you need it, good meat.

MADDY

So you've been fighting?

INMAN

(as if he might break)

I could be at killing for days

sometimes, in the hand to hand, my

feet against the feet of my enemy

and I always killed him and he never

killed me.

MADDY

He gave it a try, to look at you.

INMAN

I guess he did.

MADDY

See I think there's a plan. There's

a design. For each and every one of

us.

MADDY

You look at nature, a bird flies

somewhere, picks up a seed, shits

the seed out, a plant grows. Bird's

got a job, seed's got a job.

MADDY

Take one of these now with your food.

MADDY

Swallow it. If you die I'll give you

your money back.

MADDY

Our minds aren't made to hold on to

the particulars of pain, the way we

do bliss.

INMAN

It's true...

MADDY

What is?

INMAN

What you remember.

MADDY

What's her name?

INMAN

Ada.

(At the food)

-- Sometimes I think I'm crazy when

I'm just hungry --

(another mouthful)

Ada Monroe.

MADDY

And is she waiting for you?

INMAN

She was. I don't know. Or if she'd

know me. I'm like the boy who goes

out in winter for firewood comes

back in the spring with a whistle.

MADDY

Now drink this. It visits the pain.

And you'll sleep.

INMAN

I've had to put myself in the way of

people's kindness.

MADDY

I hope you found it.

INMAN

The passenger pigeons fly south, the

berries ripen. Whether I see them or

not, whether a man dies, or a war is

won.

MADDY

That's the laudanum getting to you.

That's good. Say something more.

(she kneels to his

leg)

Raise that up for me.

INMAN

She gave me a book. Ada Monroe. Man

by the name of Bartram. Wrote about

his travels. I carried that book

through every battle. I left it

someplace, got to get it back.

Sometimes just reading the name of a

place near home -- Sorell Cove, Fire

Scale Ridge -- was enough to bring

me to tears. Thing is I've been

thinking -- those places belonged to

people before us, to the Indian --

and he had a different name. What

did he call Sorell Cove? How can a

name not even the real name break

your heart? It's her, she's the place

I'm heading. And I hardly know her.

So how can a person who's maybe not

even a real person -- I don't know

what I'm talking about -- I have to

close my eyes...

RUBY

It's a man.

ADA

What is?

RUBY

Raiding our corn. Got him in the

trap. That's him yelping.

ADA

You're not going to shoot him!

RUBY

I don't want him to shoot me.

(of the gun)

Can you fire this thing?

ADA

(making it clear she

can't)

Yes.

RUBY

Listen up -- you got a barrel trained

on your rear-end.

STOBROD

Get me out of this dang thing. My

fist's about to drop off.

RUBY

You got a weapon?

STOBROD

No ma'am. I'm begging you. I'm already

on my knees, otherwise I'd get down

on them.

RUBY

(suddenly recognises

the voice)

Unbelievable! Stobrod Thewes.

STOBROD

Ruby? God damn!

ADA

What?

RUBY

(to Ada, disgusted)

That's my daddy...

STOBROD

Just so's you know -- I can eat while

she's doing this -- in case you're

holding off.

RUBY

Just so's you know -- you're not

eating inside. Number One -- they

hang people round here for taking in

deserters. Number two -- even if

they gave out prizes -- you'd still

eat outside.

STOBROD

You're scarred.

RUBY

I'm what?

STOBROD

Your heart. Scarred. I did wrong to

you.

RUBY

You'd be scarred. You'd be really

scarred if I hadn't wrapped them

trap teeth in sacking. Which was her

idea.

STOBROD

I hurt you.

RUBY

Good God!

STOBROD

I wrote fifty tunes with you in mind.

Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby with the

eyes that sparkle.

RUBY

Hey! Let's agree: you beat me, you

abandoned me, you ignored me, you

beat me some more -- all of that is

better than Ruby with the eyes that

sparkle!

STOBROD

I'm changed. People change. War

changes people something terrible.

(to Ada)

Ruby's told you -- I've no doubt --

I wasn't always the best...

RUBY

You were an asshole.

STOBROD

I can't disagree with that. I was.

RUBY

Get him out of here!

STOBROD

Music's changed me. I'm full of music,

darling. I wish I'd brung my fiddle

Hey Ruby! Got a new fiddle -- it's

got a little snake's rattle in the

body -- took it off a dead federal

in Virginia. That's a beautiful

fiddle. It's full of tunes, Ruby.

Don't know if it's from that little

rattle locked up in it, or from

something untied my heart.

RUBY

You're all set.

STOBROD

(sincerely)

Bless you both.

RUBY

Ain't you got a proper coat?

STOBROD

Darling, I'm fine. And you just say

the word, I won't come back neither.

I don't want to put either you or

your mistress here in any bother.

ADA

I'm not Ruby's employer.

STOBROD

Oh, okay, who is?

RUBY

Nobody.

(Stobrod digests this)

I'll make up food for you, you come

Sundays before it's light, I'll leave

it behind the Old Frazier Mill.

STOBROD

Do you know who really needs a coat,

darling, is my partner, fat boy name

of Pangle. We're hiding up in the

caves and he feels the cold like a

thin man, but ain't no coat'll fit

him.

(leaving)

I love you, Ruby. In case the sky

falls on our head. You're a good

girl.

RUBY

He is so full of manure, that man,

we could lay him on the dirt and

grow another one just like him.

ADA

So that's Stobrod Thewes.

RUBY

It is and that's the last you'll see

of him.

MADDY

That's medicine and goatmeat. You're

sick of both.

INMAN

I have a deal to thank you for.

MADDY

And that's just for show, or -- if

you can get close enough -- a wild

turkey.

RUBY

Get on back where you came from!

ADA (V.O.)

My love for Heathcliff resembles the

eternal rocks beneath

ADA

-- a source of little visible delight,

But necessary.

RUBY

She ain't gonna marry Linton, is

she? She said -- whatever our souls

are made of his and mine are the

same. You can't say that and then

marry Linton.

ADA

We'll find out.

RUBY

Okay.

ADA

Tomorrow.

RUBY

I'm not waiting until tomorrow.

ADA

Ruby, I'm falling asleep.

RUBY

Little visible delight, but necessary.

I like that...

INMAN

I'm one man alone. I'm a Confederate

soldier on furlough. I have no bad

intention. I need shelter and food.

INMAN

Can I at least sleep in the corn

crib -- just for some shelter? I'll

be on my way come morning.

SARA (V.O.)

I've got a rifle.

INMAN

Fair enough.

SARA

There's some beans and corn pone,

all I got. You better come in.

INMAN

Thank you.

SARA

I'm alone here, as you can see, with

my baby. I need to believe you mean

no harm.

INMAN

No, I mean to give it to you.

SARA

I don't want it. I had my way they'd

take metal altogether out of this

world. Every blade, every gun.

INMAN

Is your baby sick?

SARA

He cries. I don't know. He cries a

lot. My man is dead. He took his

wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw

his boy.

INMAN

I'm sorry.

SARA

It's pretty much what you'll get if

you knock on any door of this war.

Man dead, woman left.

SARA

It's mean food but it's hot.

INMAN

(ashamed of his hunger)

There's no hunting on the road, just

cress and --

SARA

I need to feed this man, if you could

look away.

SARA

Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders

took them. Made me kill our own dog

on the porch. That poor creature

watched over me. Nothing left now

save a hog and couple of chickens to

live off till spring. I'll have to

kill that hog and make sense of the

flesh and divisions which is something

I never did.

INMAN

I could do that for you in the

morning.

SARA

I'm not asking.

INMAN

It's what I'd gladly do for you for

what you're gladly doing for me. I'm

Inman by the way. That's my name.

SARA

I'm Sara. My baby's Ethan.

INMAN

Glad to know you both.

SARA

You look about his size. He was

another man straight up and down.

SARA

I don't even have a blanket.

INMAN

I got a blanket.

SARA

I'll leave you the lamp.

SARA

They fit?

INMAN (O.S.)

Pretty much. These boots are good

boots.

SARA

I'll say good night.

INMAN (O.S.)

Good night.

SARA

Will you come inside?

SARA

Could you do something for me? Do

you think you could lie here, next

to me, and not need to go further?

INMAN

I don't know. I'll try.

INMAN

I'll go. I'll go, shall I?

SARA

I don't want you to.

PANGLE

(of Sally)

She don't speak.

STOBROD

She can't speak. I told you.

PANGLE

(smiles at Sally)

Is she feeble then?

STOBROD

No.

(to Sally)

Don't mind him.

(to Ruby)

Hey Ruby: what about this?

STOBROD

Don't make that face -- you listen:

c'mon Georgia...

GEORGIA

There's snow in the air.

RUBY

Don't sleep here.

STOBROD

We won't.

ADA

It's bitter, they could stop one

night.

RUBY

They stop one night, they'll want to

stop two.

PANGLE

This coat's warm.

STOBROD

What about next Sunday? That'll be

the New Year. It's gonna be a better

one.

RUBY

Maybe.

GEORGIA

The war's over in a month.

RUBY

He said that a month ago.

ADA

(shaking Stobrod's

hand in goodnight)

It started off being over in a month.

STOBROD

Miss Ada. Merry Christmas.

ADA

Merry Christmas. Pangle. Georgia.

GEORGIA

'Night.

PANGLE

'Night now.

STOBROD

That's my Ruby.

GEORGIA

She's an original.

STOBROD

You think the Good Lord would forgive

an old cold fool if he changed his

mind? Ada said it herself it was

bitter...

RUBY

What kind of name's Georgia?

ADA

It's where he comes from, it's not

his name.

RUBY

I know that's meant to be the ugliest

state under the heavens.

ADA

Why do you care what his name is?

RUBY

(a funny look, then)

What's that cluster of Stars?

ADA

Orion.

RUBY

What about them shaped like a

wishbone?

ADA

That's Taurus the bull, and that's

Gemini and that's Orion's big dog,

Canis Major.

RUBY

Listen to her, Sal. She's turned

into a highland girl.

ADA

I could always name the stars, Ruby,

that was never my problem.

ADA

I love you darling. In case that big

old sky falls on our heads. And I

love you, too. Sal.

RUBY

It's sad, Sal. It's a c-a-t-a-s-t-r-

o-p-h-e.

STOBROD (O.S.)

No sense setting off in snow.

SARA

Get out of here, quick!

SARA

Federals are coming. They find you

here it'll go bad on all of us.

INMAN

I can try and fight them.

SARA

No, my baby. Please no! Just get.

PISTOL

We got all day.

SARA

My baby's sick! Cover him up! He's

shaking! Have some pity.

SARA

I got nothing. I swear.

NYM

That ain't necessarily so.

SARA

Yes! Take me inside! Let's all go

inside! Take my baby inside and then

we'll do whatever you want.

SARA

(screaming)

There's nothing! You take that hog

I'm as good as dead. Cover up my

boy!

BARDOLPH

This is ready to get a fit going.

It's shuddering. It's gone blue.

PISTOL

(to Nym)

How long does he want? Hey! Leave

some for the rest of us.

INMAN

Move away from the baby.

BARDOLPH

Don't shoot.

INMAN

Take off your boots.

(Bardolph does so)

Take off your pants, and your shirt.

BARDOLPH

Don't shoot me, please. We're

starving. We haven't eaten.

INMAN

You'd better get running before you

catch your death of cold.

BARDOLPH

(nods, terrified)

Thanks, thank you. I will.

SARA

Good?

ADA

Do you think he's dead?

RUBY

Who?

ADA

(shrugs)

This snow. Isn't it supposed to fall

with bad news?

RUBY

Bad news is girls get working. I'm

going to round up the animals.

(squints up at the

snow)

This'll settle.

GEORGIA

What d'you reckon? Think we could

eat this?

STOBROD

You cook something long enough you

can eat anything.

PANGLE

(prodding it)

It's frozen. How long it been there

for?

STOBROD

You hungry?

PANGLE

Yeah.

STOBROD

Not very long.

STOBROD

Edible.

PANGLE

Ow!

GEORGIA

(takes a bite from

his skewer)

Don't taste much like venison.

PANGLE

It's good. I think it's good.

TEAGUE

Evening. Hope we didn't disturb you.

STOBROD

You're all right.

TEAGUE

Name's Teague. Do I know you?

STOBROD

Thewes.

TEAGUE

You a deserter? -- don't mind if I

just warm up at your fire.

(of the sleeping Pangle)

That your wife?

STOBROD

Who? That's a he!

TEAGUE

He your wife?

STOBROD

We're musicians. He picks the banjo,

I got a fiddle.

TEAGUE

(to his men)

Look pretty romantic by the fire.

Don't they?

(to Stobrod)

Your boyfriend's got a nice bit of

flesh on him. Close your eyes slip

inside that shirt get two good

handfuls -- dark enough I'd be

willing. I'm just kidding.

(to his men)

Tell him, I'm just kidding.

BOSIE

He's just kidding.

TEAGUE

Did you answer my question -- about

your military status?

STOBROD

Discharged. Took a wound at

Petersburg.

TEAGUE

Oh, so like a hero's discharge.

STOBROD

I guess.

TEAGUE

And your boyfriend?

STOBROD

The military wouldn't take him. He

can't fight. He's simple. He's got a

mind no bigger'n a pickled walnut.

TEAGUE

I'm sorry -- he's fat, he's simple

and got titties -- but you're

insisting he ain't a woman. God damn!

Don't that sausage smell outstanding.

STOBROD

(he's very nervous)

Miqhty outstanding.

TEAGUE

Mighty outstanding! There's a new

phrase. Mighty outstanding. Listen,

don't tell me -- you left your papers

somewhere.

STOBROD

Which papers?

TEAGUE

Your hero's discharge. For mighty

outstanding valour.

STOBROD

They're, they're, they're at my house.

TEAGUE

(enjoying himself)

And where, where, where is your house?

STOBROD

Down the mountain.

TEAGUE

But you're up the mountain.

STOBROD

Hunting. Drinking.

TEAGUE

On honeymoon.

(to his men)

I'm pretty fucking funny tonight.

BOSIE

Is he going to play?

(to Stobrod)

You gonna play that fiddle?

STOBROD

Sure. Sure.

(kicks Pangle)

Hey, wake up!

TEAGUE

Evening, Mrs.

PANGLE

(looking around)

Where's Georgia?

TEAGUE

(interested)

Where's Georgia?

STOBROD

He don't know what he's saying. We

were talking about Georgia early on --

maybe heading down there.

TEAGUE

Georgia's like my armpit. Worse,

it's like yours.

(to Pangle)

Want some sausage?

PANGLE

Thanks. You is Home Guard?

TEAGUE

Yes, ma'am.

PANGLE

You is Teague?

TEAGUE

(to the others)

I'm known!

STOBROD

He don't know what he's saying.

PANGLE

(quoting)

That bastard Teague.

TEAGUE

Really.

PANGLE

Bad words. Folk always put the curse

words in front of your name.

STOBROD

Mr. Teague wants us to play.

PANGLE

Okay.

TEAGUE

We heard there were deserters in

these parts. Hiding out in a big

cave.

STOBROD

Not come to my ears.

TEAGUE

You don't know where this cave is?

STOBROD

No, sir.

PANGLE

You do, Stobes! He means --

STOBROD

Right, right! he means, there is a

cave, right, it's up over the other

side, big cave, we played some music

up there, never occurred to me they

were deserters. Near Bearpen Branch.

PANGLE

Ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch!

It's this side! He's always getting

lost. That cave -- we live there! --

it's over on Big Stomp. Tell you how

I always find it. There's a big old

locust tree fell down across the

path, that points straight at it,

like a finger, always a dozen

squirrels round that tree. You gets

to the tree, sit on it, and there's

your entrance, straight in front of

you, tree points at it. Come right

to your hand, them squirrels --

(makes a chirping

sound)

-- Chrrrpppp! Chrrrrppp!

TEAGUE

Sounds good. Okay, let's eat, let's

hear some music.

STOBROD

I call this tune: Ruby's Lament.

PANGLE

What'd you make of that?

BOSIE

Heartbreaking.

TEAGUE

Stand over by that tree.

STOBROD

Me?

TEAGUE

Over by that tree. Over there. Take

your boyfriend.

STOBROD

Come on.

TEAGUE

Don't smile.

PANGLE

What?

TEAGUE

Quit smiling.

STOBROD

He always smiles. He don't mean

nothing by it. I told him this world's

got nothing worth a smile.

TEAGUE

Put your hat over your face.

PANGLE

What do you mean?

TEAGUE

Cover your face with your hat.

ADA

I told Georgia he can stop here,

sleep in the barn. He's got nothing

inside him. He'd walk out of here

and die in the snow.

RUBY

He can milk the cows. I was worrying

about that. It'll be dark in a couple

of hours. I's ten hours climb from

here. He's drawn a map.

ADA

Okay.

RUBY

(boiling)

You know these fools stayed the night

in the Mill? That's Stobrod -- he

can't do one good thing without adding

the bad. Left tracks in the snow all

the way up for them Home Guards to

follow. That's a sign says shoot me!

ADA

Ruby, I'm so sorry.

RUBY

We should get going.

RUBY

Every piece of this is a man's

bullshit. They call this a war a

cloud over the land, but they made

the weather. Then they stand in the

rain and say: shit! It's raining!

(tears welling)

If I cry one tear for my Daddy I

stole it off a crocodile.

ADA

I don't understand.

RUBY

Maybe Teague's took him. They did

that with the Swanger boys -- didn't,

they? -- dragged them into town,

then strung them up as warning...

it's snowed since, so I can't read

the story on the ground.

RUBY

Let's dig.

ADA

Ruby! Ruby!

RUBY

He's still breathing!

(to Stobrod)

God damn! Daddy; Daddy -- it's Ruby.

Don't you die on me again.

(to Ada)

He's still breathing!

RUBY

Pack a pan full of snow. I need good

clean water, boiled up.

ADA

Let's get him home. We have herbs

there and it's warm.

RUBY

He'll die first. He's got hardly no

blood left in him.

ADA

He'll die lying here.

RUBY

There's a place further on up. Used

to be. Old Cherokee place. There's

good water right by it.

ADA

This horse is weary. He's ready to

give up the ghost.

ADA

Good boy.

(she blows into his

nostrils, calming

him)

That's warmer, isn't it.

ADA

I'm getting firewood.

ADA

That wood -- that sound when it burns

that mean more snow?

RUBY

Yes, it do, country girl.

ADA

Turn round and go back where you

came from.

INMAN

Ada? Ada Monroe?

ADA

I do not know you.

INMAN

Then I believe I made a mistake.

INMAN

If I knew where to go I'd go there.

ADA

(finally recognising

him)

Inman?

ADA

You'd better come with me.

ADA

Ruby, this is Inman.

RUBY

Congratulations, I should send you

out with a shotgun more often. He

looks as he needs sleep.

INMAN

I may need to.

RUBY

Be my guest. You shot or something?

INMAN

Not lately.

RUBY

Hungry?

(Inman nods, Ruby to

Ada)

He woke up.

ADA

Stobrod?

RUBY

Said -- your mommy's name was Grace

then closed his eyes again.

ADA

He's asleep. They both are.

RUBY

I'm not surprised. Your man looks

played out.

ADA

I saw him. I realize now.

RUBY

Saw him when?

ADA

In Sally Swanger's well. A tunnel of

trees. The man like a black smudge

in the snow, the sun behind him.

RUBY

Well there you are.

ADA

Funny thing is it wasn't the same.

The image. It wasn't snowing. And in

the well, he was, as if he were

falling.

RUBY

You probably don't remember it right.

ADA

I remember it exactly. There were

crows, these black crows flying

towards me. I thought I was seeing

him fall. Instead I was seeing him

come back to me. All this while I've

been packing ice around my heart.

How will I make it melt?

RUBY

Better get a fire going.

(goes to the fireplace)

I've got big plans for that farm.

Got a vision in my mind of how that

Cove needs to be.

ADA

I know you have.

RUBY

There's not a thing we can't do

ourselves.

INMAN

I'm sorry. I was trying to be quiet.

ADA

I couldn't sleep.

INMAN

-- I got no appetite left to be in a

room with wounded men.

ADA

I can't see your face.

INMAN

It's not a face you recognised.

ADA

Did you get my letters?

INMAN

I got three letters. Carried them in

that book you gave me. The Bertram.

ADA

I must have sent 100. Did you write

to me?

INMAN

Whenever I could. If you never got

them I can summarize.

ADA

No, it's --

INMAN

I pray you're well. I pray I'm in

your thoughts. You are all that keeps

me from sliding into some dark place.

ADA

But how did I keep you? We barely

knew each other. A few moments.

INMAN

A thousand moments. They're like a

bag of tiny diamonds glittering in a

black heart. Don't matter if they're

real or things I made up. The shape

of your neck. The way you felt under

my hands when I pulled you to me.

ADA

Your boots, one polished, one not

yet polished.

INMAN

You're playing a piano and I'm

standing outside.

ADA

I'm playing a piano and you're

standing outside.

INMAN

That kiss -- which I've kissed again

every day of my walking.

ADA

Every day of my waiting.

INMAN

Maybe you can't see my face, but if

you could see my inside, my whatever

you want to name it, my spirit, that's

the fear I have deeper than any gash

on my neck. I think I'm ruined. They

kept trying to put me in the ground,

but I wasn't ready, no ma'am, no

more ready than that scoundrel in

there's not ready to die on us. But

if I had goodness, I lost it. If I

had anything tender in me I shot it

dead.

RUBY

Number one -- shut this door, it's

freezing.

(goes over to Stobrod's

hut)

Number two -- shut that door, it's

freezing.

(turns to them)

I'm laying on my back, with my fingers

poked in my ears trying to shut out

who's got a bag of diamonds and who's

got boots needs polishing, If you

want to get three feet up a bull's

ass listen to what sweethearts whisper

to each other.

RUBY

In fact, if you're going to wimble

all night I'm going to sleep in with

him.

ADA

Now I can't see anything.

INMAN

I'll say goodnight.

ADA

I don't think Ruby's vacating my hut

so that you can sleep in a different

one.

ADA

Come in.

ADA

Whatever comes to pass between you

and me, I want Ruby to stay in Black

Cove.

INMAN

Right.

ADA

As long as she wants. And if she

never leaves I'll be glad.

INMAN

More a question could she put up

with me.

ADA

And you understand she's my friend,

she's not a hired hand and she doesn't

empty a night jar unless it's her

own.

INMAN

Sure.

ADA

This war's made some things pointless.

It's hard to imagine a wedding. I

think even my father would recognize

that.

INMAN

Ada, I want to marry you. If you'll

have me.

ADA

Isn't there's some religion where

you just have to say I marry you,

three times, and then you're man and

wife.

INMAN

I marry you. I marry you. I marry

you.

INMAN

Why's that funny?

ADA

No, I think it's I divorce you three

times and then you're not married

anymore.

INMAN

I can wait for you.

ADA

You waited enough. I certainly did.

I marry you. I marry you. I marry

you.

ADA

I'm sorry about the way I look. In

these clothes.

(Inman shakes his

head)

And there are so many buttons.

(starts to undress)

Will you turn your back?

INMAN

Not for all the gold dollars in the

Federal Bank.

INMAN

You go ahead. I'll follow with the

horse at a pace your daddy can

tolerate.

ADA

We can all go together.

INMAN

It's safer this way. No one has

quarrel with you.

RUBY

He's right.

INMAN

(to Ruby)

I gather I need permission if I reckon

on living at Black Cove.

INMAN

We'll get to you by nightfall.

ADA

You be safe.

INMAN

Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some

category of fly born on the hide of

a cow. It flies up into a tree and

waits and waits until it smells cow.

It can wait a year, two years, I

don't know, maybe longer. Then a cow

comes along and it wakes up, flies

down, lays its eggs on the cow.

There's purpose for you.

ADA

And am I the fly in this story, or

the cow?

STOBROD

You come up the mountain for me,

darling, I'd be dead otherwise, dead

and gone.

RUBY

You'd have found some other fool to

rescue you.

STOBROD

He's sweet on you, that Georgia boy.

RUBY

If you say a thing and then cough

it's a lie. Daddy, stay on that horse,

and don't lose him or sell him. We'll

need him on the farm.

RUBY

I hope that Georgia boy's been seeing

to the animals.

ADA

I thought you were thinking on him!

RUBY

I was not. I was thinking on swollen

udders -- and before you say same

difference...

ADA

I'm saying nothing.

RUBY

Miss lovey-dovey!

INMAN

(quietly to Stobrod)

Don't look round.

STOBROD

Got it.

INMAN

How many men does he have?

STOBROD

There were five. You can't reason

with that man.

INMAN

(takes off his gloves)

I got a conversation stopper.

(they're getting closer)

Closer we get to that broken ground

the better.

INMAN

You hold on tight, do you hear? When

I say three, look round, nice and

slow.

STOBROD

Okay.

INMAN

One, two, three.

TEAGUE

God damn! You're a hard fucker to

put down.

(they approach)

Good directions to that cave from

the fat boy -- saw the squirrels,

sat on the tree made some friends,

brought some back with me.

INMAN

Come out of there.

BOSIE

No, sir. Here's fine.

INMAN

I just have to shoot the horse from

under you.

BOSIE

Shoot her. She's not mine. You riding

Mr Teague's mare?

INMAN

I am.

BOSIE

He dead?

INMAN

I hope so.

(wearily, as he brings

his horse inside the

trees)

Look, how old are you? Give me your

gun and ride home, I'm done fighting.

I'm sick of it.

BOSIE

I give you my gun you'll shoot me

dead.

INMAN

I will not shoot you, but nor am I

walking down that mountain looking

over my shoulder for you.

BOSIE

That's what they call a conundrum. I

tell you what I've got on my side.

INMAN

What have you got on your side?

BOSIE

The confidence of youth.

ADA

You bring that lamb outside.

GRACE

What are you doing!

ADA

He came out dead, love.

GRACE

Don't kill him!

ADA

I'm not going to kill him. But we

have to try something or else he's

going to die.

ADA

Isn't that a small mercy.

ADA

(laughing)

Hot hot hot hot hot!!!

ADA

Grace Inman, nobody said eat.

(then to Stobrod)

Mr. Thewes...

ADA

For good friends, good food, good

family: for all our blessings -- Oh

Lord we thank thee. Amen.

ALL

Amen !

THE END
