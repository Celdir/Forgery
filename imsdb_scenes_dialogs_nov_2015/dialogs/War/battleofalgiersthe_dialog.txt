OTHER PARAS

So he spoke? Does he really know where

Ali is?

It seems so. We'll go see. Give him a

little coffee.

Hey Marc, you made him talk?

Sure.

LAGLOY

C'mon Sadek ... Drink, you'll feel better.

At ease. Is it true?

I think so. Rue des Abderames three ...

MATHIEU

Dress him.

MATHIEU

Chin up, it's all over. Nothing can happen

to you now, you'll see. Can you stand up?

MATHIEU

Let him go.

MATHIEU

Here, put them on.

MATHIEU

We're trying to help you. We're going to

the Casbah. Dressed like this, they won't

be able to recognize you. Understand?

We're going to see the place, then you'll

be free ... and under our protection ...

MATHIEU

Go on, give him the cap.

LAGLOY

Nationalized!

Don't be an idiot, Lagloy!

At the right moment she will give you a

quickly and in the back.

ALI

Don't move! Look at him. You're not

giving any orders now! Your hands are up,

We're going there ... if you don't get us

arrested first.

ALI

(pushing her ahead)

Move ... go ahead. I'll follow you.

17	TERRACE. KADER'S HOUSE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.

KADER

You could have been a spy. We had to put

you to the test.

ALI

With an unloaded pistol?

KADER

I'll explain.

KADER

Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison,

when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to

support the revolution, and then the

French help you to escape ...

ALI

Sure. By shooting at me.

KADER

Even that could be a trick. You escape,

then show up at the address which the

brothers in prison gave to you, and so

you are able to contact me ...

ALI

I don't even know your name yet ...

KADER

My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ...

In other words, in order to join the

organization, you had to undergo a test.

I could have told you to murder the

barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the

police would let you kill him, even

though he is one of theirs. By obeying

such an order, you still could have

been a double agent. And that's why I

told you to kill the French policeman:

because the French wouldn't have let

you do it. If you were with the police

you wouldn't have done it.

ALI

But I haven't shot him.

KADER

(smiling)

You weren't able to. But what's important

is that you tried.

ALI

What's important for me is that you let me

risk my life for nothing.

KADER

C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders

were to shoot him in the back.

ALI

I don't do that kind of thing.

KADER

Then don't complain.

ALI

You still haven't told me why you didn't

let me kill him.

KADER

Because we aren't ready yet for the

French. Before attacking, we must have

safe places from which to depart and find

refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah.

But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There

are too many drunks, pushers, whores,

addicts, spies ... people who talk too

much ... people who are ready to sell

themselves, undecided people. We must

either convince them or eliminate them.

We must think of ourselves first. We must

clean out the Casbah first. Only then

will we be able to deal with the French.

Do you understand, Ali?

ALI

And how many are we?

KADER

Not enough.

18 	AREAS OF CASBAH UNDERWORLD. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. MARCH 1956.

SPEAKER

"National Liberation Front, bulletin

number 24. Brothers of the Casbah! The

colonial administration is responsible not

only for our people's great misery, but

also for the degrading vices of many of

our brothers who have forgotten their own

dignity ..."

SPEAKER

"Corruption and brutality have always

been the most dangerous weapons of

colonialism. The National Liberation

Front calls all the people to struggle

for their own physical and moral

redemption -- indispensable conditions

for the reconquest of independence.

Therefore beginning today, the

clandestine authority of the NLF

prohibits the following activities:

gambling, the sale and usage of all types

of drugs, the sale and usage of alcoholic

beverages, prostitution and its

solicitation. Transgressors will be

punished. Habitual transgressors will be

punished by death."

you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?

It's true.

The NLF has condemned you to death.

already warned you twice; this is the

last warning. Decide.

You've got to change occupations, Hacene.

Right away!

months, they have reached an average of

4.2 assaults per day, including

aggression against individuals, and the

explosions. Of course, the conditions of

the problem are as usual: first, the

adversary; second, the method to destroy

him ... There are 80,000 Arabs in the

Casbah. Are they all against us? We know

they are not. In reality, it is only a

small minority that dominates with

terror and violence. This minority is

our adversary and we must isolate and

destroy it ...

MATHIEU

Draw it down there too ...

MATHIEU

He is an adversary who shifts his

position above and below the surface with

highly commendable revolutionary methods

and original tactics. ... He is an

anonymous and unrecognizable enemy who

mingles with thousands of others who

resemble him. We find him everywhere: in

the alleys of the Casbah; in the streets

of the European city, and in working

places.

MATHIEU

Go ahead, Martin.

MATHIEU

Here is some film taken by the police.

The cameras were hidden at the Casbah

exits. They thought these films might be

useful, and in fact they are useful in

demonstrating the usefulness of certain

methods. Or, at least, their inadequacy.

MATHIEU

I chose these films because they were

shot in the hours preceding some recent

terroristic assaults. And so, among all

these Arabs, men and women, there are the

ones responsible. But which ones are they?

How can we recognize them? Controlling

documents is ridiculous: one who has

everything in order is most likely to be

the terrorist.

MATHIEU

(smiling)

Note the intuition of the cameraman. He

realized that in that box, there had to

be something of interest, and he paused

to focus it.

MATHIEU

(laughing)

Maybe the bomb was hidden right there, in

a double bottom. Who knows? We'll never

know.

MATHIEU

That's enough, Martin ...

MATHIEU

We must start again from scratch. The only

information that we have concerns the

structure of the organization. And we

shall begin from that ...

MATHIEU

It is a pyramid-like organization divided

into a series of sectors. At the top of

the pyramid is their General Staff.

MATHIEU

The military commander responsible for

the executive body finds the right man

and nominates him to responsibility for

a sector: number one. Number one in his

turn, chooses another two: number two and

number three ... And so they form the

first triangle.

MATHIEU

Now number two and number three choose,

in their turn, two men each ... number

four and five, and so on ...

MATHIEU

The reason for this geometry is so that

every militant will know only three

members in the entire organization: his

commander who has chosen him, and the two

members that he himself has chosen ...

Contacts take place only by written

instructions ... That is why we do not

know our adversaries: because, in

practice, they do not even know each

other.

MATHIEU

To know them means to eliminate them.

Consequently, the military aspect is

secondary to the police method. I know we

are not fond of this word, but it is the

only word that indicates exactly the type

of work that we must perform. We must

make the necessary investigations in

order to proceed from one vertex to

another in the entire pyramid. The

reason for this work is information. The

method is interrogation. And

interrogation becomes a method when

conducted in a manner so as to always

obtain a result, or rather, an answer.

In practice, demonstrating a false

humanitarianism only leads to the

ridiculous and to impotence. I am

certain that all the units will

understand and react accordingly.

However, success does not depend solely

on us. We need to have the Casbah at our

disposal. We must sift through it ... and

interrogate everyone. And here is where

we find ourselves hindered by a

conspiracy of laws and regulations that

continue to be operative, as if Algiers

were a holiday resort and not a

battleground. We have requested a carte

blanche. But it is very difficult to

obtain. Therefore, it is necessary to

find an excuse to legitimize our

intervention, and make it possible. It

is necessary to create it ourselves --

this excuse. Unless our adversaries will

think of it themselves, which seems to be

what they are doing.

possible reprisals ... But I didn't know

that they would be brought to this house

BEN M'HIDI

Why?

KADER

Because you are here too. It would be

better for you to move to another house.

BEN M'HIDI

All right ... You're the one who must

KADER

No, if I were the one to decide, you

wouldn't be in Algiers now.

BEN M'HIDI

KADER

It isn't wise.

I think it'll be a success ...

BEN M'HIDI

Yes, I think so too ... It's been

organized well ... But what will the

French do?

ALI

(shrugging)

It's clear. They'll do everything

possible to make it fail.

BEN M'HIDI

No, they'll do even more. We've given

them the opportunity to do a lot more ...

Do you understand what I mean? Starting

tomorrow, they won't be groping in the

dark any more; every shop and every

worker who strikes will be a known enemy,

a self-confessed criminal ... And they

will be able to pass to the offensive.

Have you thought of this?

ALI

(shaking his head)

No ...

BEN M'HIDI

But Kader told me that you weren't in

favor of the strike.

ALI

No, and neither were my men.

BEN M'HIDI

Why?

ALI

Because they told us that we mustn't use

weapons, now, when the time is right.

BEN M'HIDI

That's true ... Wars aren't won with

terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions.

Terrorism is a beginning but afterward,

all the people must act ... This is the

reason for the strike, and its necessity:

to mobilize all Algerians, count them and

measure their strength ...

ALI

To show them to the UN, right?

BEN M'HIDI

(smiling slightly)

Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the

UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this

way, we'll give the UN the possibility of

evaluating our strength.

BEN M'HIDI

Do you know something Ali? Starting a

revolution is hard, and it's even harder

to continue it. Winning is hardest of all.

But only afterward, when we have won,

will the real hardships begin.

BEN M'HIDI

Anyway, there's still a lot to be done

... you aren't already tired, Ali, are

you?

ALI

(with conviction)

No!

French have to stop history.

112	PREFECT'S OFFICE. PRESS HALL. INSIDE. DAY. MARCH 4.

1ST JOURNALIST

Colonel Mathieu ... the spokesman for the

residing minister, Mr. Gorlin, has stated

that "Larbi Ben M'Hidi committed suicide

in his own cell, hanging himself with

pieces of his shirt, that he had used to

make a rope, and then attached to the

bars of his cell window." In a preceding

statement, the same spokesman had

specified that: "... due to the intention

already expressed by the prisoner Ben

M'Hidi to escape at the first opportunity,

it has been necessary to keep his hands

and feet bound continually." In your

opinion, colonel, in such conditions, is

a man capable of tearing his shirt,

making a rope from it, and attaching it

to a bar of the window to hang himself?

MATHIEU

You should address that question to the

minister's spokesman. I'm not the one who

made those statements ... On my part, I

will say that I had the opportunity to

admire the moral strength, intelligence,

and unwavering idealism demonstrated by

Ben M'Hidi. For these reasons, although

remembering the danger he represented, I

do not hesitate to pay homage to his

memory.

2ND JOURNALIST

Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said

lately not only of the successes

obtained by the paratroopers, but also of

the methods that they have employed ...

Can you tell us something about this?

MATHIEU

The successes obtained are the results

of those methods. One presupposes the

other and vice versa.

3RD JOURNALIST

Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression

that perhaps due to excessive prudence ...

my colleagues continue to ask the same

allusive questions, to which you can only

respond in an allusive manner. I think it

would be better to call things by their

right names; if one means torture, then

one should call it torture.

MATHIEU

I understand. What's your question?

3RD JOURNALIST

The questions have already been asked. I

would only like some precise answers,

that's all ...

MATHIEU

Let's try to be precise then. The word

"torture" does not appear in our orders.

We have always spoken of interrogation as

the only valid method in a police

operation directed against unknown

enemies. As for the NLF, they request

that their members, in the event of

capture, should maintain silence for

twenty-four hours, and then, they may

talk. Thus, the organization has already

had the time necessary to render useless

any information furnished ... What type

of interrogation should we choose? ...

the one the courts use for a crime of

homicide which drags on for months?

3RD JOURNALIST

The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...

MATHIEU

And those who explode bombs in public

places, do they perhaps respect the law?

When you asked that question to Ben

M'Hidi, remember what he said? No,

gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious

circle. And we could discuss the problem

for hours without reaching any

conclusions. Because the problem does

not lie here. The problem is: the NLF

wants us to leave Algeria and we want to

remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite

varying shades of opinion, you all agree

that we must remain. When the rebellion

first began, there were not even shades

of opinion. All the newspapers, even the

left-wing ones wanted the rebellion

suppressed. And we were sent here for

this very reason. And we are neither

madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who

call us fascists today, forget the

contribution that many of us made to the

Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do

not know that among us there are

survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We

are soldiers and our only duty is to

win. Therefore, to be precise, I would

now like to ask you a question: Should

France remain in Algeria? If you answer

"yes," then you must accept all the

necessary consequences.

MATHIEU

Now is not the time for heroes. Give me

the megaphone.

MATHIEU

Ramel ... Si Mourad ... use your heads.

If you go on like this, I wouldn't want to

be in your place when you are captured ...

Because you will be captured in the end,

and you know it too. Surrender! If you do

it immediately, I promise that you will

not be harmed and you will have a fair

trial. Can you hear me?

MOURAD

Who is speaking?

MATHIEU

Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.

MOURAD

We don't trust you, colonel. Come

forward, show yourself.

MATHIEU

I don't trust you either. First stand up

so I can see you, and keep your hands

still and well in sight.

MOURAD

Okay. But we want your promise for a fair

trial in writing. Give us a written

statement, Mathieu, and then we'll

surrender.

MATHIEU

How can I give you this statement?

MOURAD

We'll lower a basket from the window ...

MATHIEU

Okay, I'll make the statement in

writing ...

MOURAD

(without turning around)

A newspaper too, or a piece of paper ...

MOURAD

(loudly)

Are you ready, colonel?

MATHIEU

Yes ... But let me first see you.

PARA

We see them. You can come.

MOURAD

(counting)

60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53 ...

MATHIEU

Here it is ... you know that when I give

my word, I keep it ...

MATHIEU

You go ...

Hurry up, black bastard!

MATHIEU

Which one of you is Fathia?

MATHIEU

Is it you?

MATHIEU

Go up the stairs, and tell Kader that if

they don't surrender, we'll blow up

everything ... Do you understand?

MATHIEU

Try to convince him, if you care about

your house ... Wait a minute ... Do you

want to get killed?

MATHIEU

Kader, look. Fathia is coming ... I

wouldn't shoot ...

MATHIEU

Go on ...

KADER

Okay ... You can tell the colonel to blow

up whatever he likes. Go on, now.

FATHIA

(to Mathieu)

He said that you can blow up whatever

you like ...

MATHIEU

Return to where the others are. Prepare

the plastic. It should be placed on the

ceiling of the stairway under the hiding

place ... a long fuse rolled up ... Take

cover ... keep shooting while you are

working. Quickly! Clear the house ...

Bring them outside, then check the rooms

again ... Hurry up!

KADER

It doesn't do any good to die like this ...

it doesn't help anybody ...

KADER

(shouting)

Mathieu! If you give your word that you

won't touch any of the other people in

the house, we'll come out.

130	MILITARY CAR. INSIDE. NIGHT.

MATHIEU

If you had let me blow you up, you would

have disappointed me ...

KADER

Why?

MATHIEU

For many months, I've had your photo on

my desk together with a dozen or so

reports on you ... And naturally, I am

under the illusion that I know you

somewhat. You never seemed the type,

Kader, inclined to performing useless

actions.

KADER

You seem to be very satisfied to have

taken me alive ...

MATHIEU

Of course I am.

KADER

That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I

credited you with an advantage greater

than I should have.

MATHIEU

No. Let's just say that you've given me

the satisfaction to have guessed

correctly. But from the technical point

of view, it isn't possible to speak of

advantages. By now the game is over. The

NLF has been defeated.

MATHIEU

What is she saying?

She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.

ALI

We need two more, the biggest ones.

SADEK

And the others?

ALI

The others ... let's wait and see.

SADEK

I've looked, Ali, even where I work.

Nothing. The ones who have not been

arrested have left Algiers and gone into

the mountains ... And the others don't

want to hear any more about it ...

they're afraid ...

ALI

Can't you go any faster?

SADEK

Yes, sure ... here.

SADEK

If we don't find any others ... should we

call it off?

SADEK

We can't plant all of them by

ourselves ...

ALI

You don't have to plant anything. You

only have to carry them, that's all.

ALI

(turning to Petit Omar)

C'mon, hurry. Go to sleep. Tomorrow we

four have a lot of work to do: Mahmoud,

Hassiba, you and I.

ALI

Because we can't find anyone else, Sadek

will bring us there in the truck. You get

out first and plant the bomb where I tell

you ... then return here quickly. But be

careful that no one is following you. Then

Hassiba will get out, and after her,

Mahmoud. Then I will plant the ones that

are left. They'll know that we're still

strong ... you can be sure of that.

Omar, Omar. C'mon, wake up. Hurry, little

one. Today you're going to see fireworks.

MAHMOUD

It's almost time, isn't it?

ALI

Yes.

Then Ali turns to the curtain and calls:

ALI

Hassiba ...

HASSIBA

I'm ready.

MAHMOUD

I heard the sound of a truck before ...

ALI

Me too. But I don't think it was Sadek.

Otherwise he'd be here by now.

HASSIBA

(smiling)

How is your wife now?

MAHMOUD

So-so ...

Inside! Inside!

Sadek points toward the curtain. The captain signals him to go there.

MATHIEU

(to the captain)

Everything ready?

CAPTAIN

Yes, sir.

MATHIEU

He hasn't answered?

CAPTAIN

No, sir. Total silence.

MATHIEU

I thought so. It was obvious.

MATHIEU

(loudly and markedly)

Ali ... Ali la Pointe ... You're going to

be blown up. Let the others come out, at

least the child. We'll let him off with

reformatory school ... Why do you want to

make him die?

MATHIEU

Let's go ...

CAPTAIN

Bring it down there, till it reaches

outside ...

PARA

Yes, sir ...

MATHIEU

Is this one still here? ... Take him away.

MATHIEU

Ali! Ali la Pointe! I am giving you

another thirty seconds. What do you hope

to gain? You've lost anyway. Thirty

seconds, Ali, starting now.

138	ALI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAWN.

Ali la Pointe's eyes are staring at the square piece of wall that seals

laborious breathing.

ALI

(in deep, resigned voice)

Who wants to leave?

HASSIBA

What are you going to do?

ALI

I don't deal with them.

(to another paratrooper)

You stay here by the door to signal the

GENERAL

And so the tapeworm no longer has a head.

Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers

everything should be over.

MATHIEU

Yes, I believe there won't be any more

talk of the NLF for some time.

GENERAL

Let's hope forever.

1ST COLONEL

At heart they are good people. We've had

good relations with them for a hundred and

thirty years ... I don't see why we

shouldn't continue that way.

2ND COLONEL

Yes, but Algiers is not the only city in

Algeria.

MATHIEU

(smiling)

Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the

only country in the world ...

GENERAL

(smiling)

Why, yes, of course ... But for the

moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers!

In the mountains our work is always

easier.

No one knows what could have been the

Today the situation is tenser. In spite

of pressure from the more intolerant

Government has given strict orders not

to use arms except in emergency

situations. But this afternoon there were

attempts to enter the European city by

force: as a result, the first casualties

This morning for the first time, the

them overnight. Flags so to speak. Many

are strips of sheets, shirts, ribbons,
