Wladyslaw Szpilman

Final Draft, 1998

WARSAW 1939

DOROTA

Mr. Szpilman.

SZPILMAN

Hello.

DOROTA

I came specially to meet you today.

I love your playing, but what a

day to choose.

SZPILMAN

Who are you?

DOROTA

My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's

sister. oh! You're bleeding.

SZPILMAN

It's nothing.

JUREK

C'mon, Dorota, you can write him a

fan letter later, this isn't the

best time, c'mon.

SZPILMAN

(calling)

Jurek, why have you been hiding

her?

FATHER

What you think, should I take Uncle

Szymon's photograph?

MOTHER

Take it, don't take it, take what

you like. Can't you see I'm worried

sick?

FATHER

He'll come home, he'll be all right.

REGINA

Mama, Wladek's home.

MOTHER

Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.

SZPILMAN

It's a little cut, nothing.

MOTHER

I've been worried sick.

HENRYK

I told her not to worry. You had

your papers on you. If you'd been

hit by a bomb, they'd have known

where to take you.

MOTHER

Henryk, don't say things like that,

God forbid, God forbid.

HALINA

(calling through a

door)

Papa, Wladek's home.

FATHER

What did I tell you?

SZPILMAN

(looking around the

room, bemused)

What are you doing?

REGINA

What's it look like we're doing?

SZPILMAN

(to Henryk)

They bombed us, we're off the air.

HENRYK

Warsaw's not the only radio station.

MOTHER

Pack, darling, get your things,

pack.

SZPILMAN

Where are we going?

MOTHER

Out of Warsaw.

SZPILMAN

Out of Warsaw. Where?

REGINA

You haven't heard?

SZPILMAN

Heard what?

REGINA

Haven't you seen the paper? Where's

the paper?

HALINA

I used it for packing.

REGINA

(exasperated)

She used it for packing.

FATHER

The government's moved to Lublin.

HALINA

All able-bodied men must leave the

city, go across the river and set

up a new line of defence, that's

what it said.

FATHER

There's hardly anybody left in

this building, only women, the men

have gone.

SZPILMAN

And what do you think you'll do

while you're setting up a new line

of defence? Wander round lugging

your suitcases?

MOTHER

Pack, Wladek, there's no time.

SZPILMAN

I'm not going anywhere.

HALINA

Good! I'm not going anywhere either!

MOTHER

Don't be ridiculous, we've got to

keep together.

SZPILMAN

No, no, no, I'm staying put. If

I'm going to die, I prefer to die

at home.

MOTHER

God forbid!

HENRYK

Sssh!

HENRYK

Ssh! I've got something, listen...

RADIO ANNOUNCER

... an important announcement.

News has just been received through

the BBC that Great Britain, having

had no reply...

(static)

...and therefore has declared war

on Nazi Germany...

(a collective gasp)

... next few hours... awaiting

latest news...

RADIO ANNOUNCER

... but France is expected to make

a similar announcement...

(static)

... Poland is no longer alone.

HENRYK

(lighting up a

cigarette)

Mama, that was a great dinner.

SZPILMAN

It certainly was.

MOTHER

When there's something to celebrate,

you've got to make an effort.

FATHER

Here's to Great Britain and France.

FATHER

I told you. Didn't I tell you? All

will be well.

FATHER

(finishing the

counting)

Five thousand and three.

MOTHER

Is that all?

FATHER

Yes, five thousand and three zlotys,

that's all we've got left.

REGINA

It's three thousand and three zlotys

too much,

(reading from

newspaper)

'Re: Further restrictions regarding

liquid assets: Jews will be allowed

to keep a maximum of two thousand

zlotys in their homes.'

MOTHER

What are we supposed to do with

the rest?

HALINA

Deposit it in a bank. Blocked

account.

HENRYK

Banks? Who'd be stupid enough to

deposit money in a German bank?

REGINA

We could hide the money here in

the window frame.

FATHER

No, no, no. I'll tell you what

we'll do. We'll use tried and tested

methods. You know what we did in

the last war? We made a hole in

the table leg and we hid the money

in there.

HENRYK

And suppose they take the table

away?

MOTHER

What d'you mean, take the table

away?

HENRYK

The Germans go into Jewish homes

and they just take what they want,

furniture, valuables, anything.

MOTHER

Do they?

FATHER

Idiot! What would they want with a

table?

MOTHER

What on earth are you doing?

HALINA

There's a good place under the

cupboard.

HENRYK

No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --

SZPILMAN

That makes a change.

HENRYK

You know what we do? We use

psychology.

SZPILMAN

We use what?

HENRYK

We leave the money and the watch

on the table. And we cover it like

this.

(covers it with the

newspaper)

In full view. The Germans will

search high and low, I promise

you, they'll never notice it.

SZPILMAN

Of course they'll notice it. But

look--

(lifts the violin

fingerboard.)

This is a good place for something.

HENRYK

A good place for what?

(to the others')

He's insane!

SZPILMAN

Just shut up.

FATHER

(overlapping)

My violin?

REGINA

Quiet! Quiet! Order, please, order!

HALINA

She's a lawyer, she likes order.

REGINA

Listen, just listen. Let's come to

an agreement. We jam the money in

the window frame. The watch we

hide under the cupboard. And the

chain we put in the violin.

FATHER

Will I still be able to play?

SZPILMAN

Let's find out.

SZPILMAN

Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.

JUREK

(filtered)

Wladek! How are you?

SZPILMAN

Fine, we're fine, thank you, and

you?

JUREK

(filtered)

Fine, we're fine in the

circumstances. But I can guess

what you've called about. There's

nothing we can do; they won't reopen

the station--

SZPILMAN

(trying to interrupt)

Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...

JUREK

(filtered)

...not even music, nothing, no

radios for the Poles. But I'm sure

you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist

like you.

SZPILMAN

Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't

be offended, I didn't call to

discuss my future career.

DOROTA

I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks.

And at last he gave in and said,

'All right, come with me tomorrow,'

and so I came and they bombed the

station.

SZPILMAN

You know something? Meeting you

like that was absolutely wonderful.

DOROTA

Really?

SZPILMAN

Yes!

(he looks at her,

smiles)

It was...it was unforgettable.

DOROTA

I've always loved your playing,

Mr. Szpilman.

SZPILMAN

Wladek, please.

DOROTA

No one plays Chopin like you.

SZPILMAN

I could accompany you, me on the

piano, you on the cello.

DOROTA

Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite...

quite wonderful.

SZPILMAN

Wladek, please.

FATHER

(reading)

'Re: emblems for Jews in the Warsaw

District. I hereby order that all

Jews in the Warsaw District will

wear visible emblems when out of

doors. This decree will come into

force on the 1st December 1939 and

applies to all Jews over twelve

years of age. The emblem will

be worn on the right sleeve and

will represent a blue Star of David

on a white background. The

background must be sufficiently

large for the Star to measure eight

centimetres from point to point.

The width of the arms of the Star

(reading)

must be one centimetre. Jews who

do not respect this decree will be

severely punished. Governor of

Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer.'

HENRYK

I won't wear it.

REGINA

won't wear it. I'm not going to be

branded.

SZPILMAN

(grabbing the

newspaper)

Let me see this.

FATHER

Doesn't it say we have to provide

these armbands ourselves? Where

will we get them?

HENRYK

We're not going to get them. We're

not going to wear them!

GERMAN OFFICER

(a harsh shout)

You!

GERMAN OFFICER

Why didn't you bow?

FATHER

(removing his hat)

I'm sorry I...

GERMAN OFFICER

(calling after him)

You are forbidden to walk on the

pavement. Walk in the gutter!

HALINA

Have you seen this?

SZPILMAN

(irritated)

What, I'm working, what?

SZPILMAN'S VOICE

What is it?

HALINA'S VOICE

That's where they're going to put

us.

SZPILMAN'S VOICE

What d'you mean, put us?

HALINA

'By order of the Governor of the

Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer,

concerning the establishment of

the Jewish District in Warsaw.

There will be created a Jewish

District in which all Jews living

in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will

have to reside."  And look here:

'Jews living outside of the

prescribed area will have to move

to the Jewish district by 31st of

October 1940.'

SZPILMAN

But...they won't get all of us...

we'll...it's too small...there's

four hundred thousand of us in

Warsaw!

HENRYK

No. Three hundred and sixty

thousand, so it'll be easy.

HALINA

Mama, what is it?

MOTHER

Twenty zlotys. That's all we've

got left. What can I buy with twenty

zlotys?

(breaking down)

I'm sick of cooking potatoes,

potatoes, potatoes.

MR LIPA

That's the price. That's what I'm

offering. And my advice is to

accept. You won't get more from

anyone else.

REGINA

But...but it's a Steinway, Mr

Lipa...

MR LIPA

Two thousand. My advice is to take

it. What you going to do when you're

hungry? Eat the piano?

HENRYK

Get out! You're a thieving bastard,

we don't want your money, get out!

We'd rather give it away! Get out!

MR LIPA

(overlapping, warding

off Henryk)

Hey! Hey! What's the matter with

you? Haven't you eaten today, what

you suffering from? Hey!

REGINA

(overlapping)

Henryk, stop it, leave him alone.

MR LIPA

(recovering, catching

his breath,

overlapping)

You people are crazy! I'm doing

you a favour, two thousand, and

I'm paying for the removal, I'm

not even charging for the removal.

MR LIPA

You haven't eaten today, you're

crazy...

SZPILMAN

(turning to them,

severe)

Take it.

SZPILMAN

Dorota!

DOROTA

I didn't want to come, I didn't

want to see all this, but I couldn't

stop myself.

SZPILMAN

How are you doing?

DOROTA

Fine, no, not really, they arrested

my cousin, but Jurek says they'll

let him out.

(stops, tears in

her eyes.)

This is disgraceful.

SZPILMAN

Don't worry, it won't last long.

DOROTA

That's what I said, it's so - it's

too absurd!

SZPILMAN

I'll see you...soon.

FATHER

To tell you the truth, I thought

it would be worse.

SZPILMAN

How will we sleep?

MOTHER

I'll sleep with the girls in the

kitchen. You, Henrykc and Papa in

here.

HALINA

(at a window)

Look! Come and look!

SZPILMAN

You sell anything?

HENRYK

Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot.

Three zlotys.

SZPILMAN

That's better than yesterday.

HENRYK

Three lousy zlotys. And there are

people here making millions.

SZPILMAN

I know.

HENRYK

You don't know, believe me. They

bribe the guards. The guards turn

a blind eye. They're bringing in

cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor,

French cosmetics, and the poor are

dying all around them and they

don't give a damn.

THE FEATHER WOMAN

Excuse me, but have you by any

chance seen my husband Izaak

Szerman?

SZPILMAN

I'm afraid not.

THE FEATHER WOMAN

A tall handsome man with a little

grey beard?

They shake their heads.

THE FEATHER WOMAN

No?

(she is near to

tears, then smiles

artificially.)

Oh, do forgive me.

(as she goes)

Goodbye, sleep well, if you see

him, please do write, Izaak

Szerman's his name...

HENRYK

Sometimes I wish I could go mad.

THE NERVOUS MAN

This is totally insane; why do we

have to have a gentile street

running through our area? Can't

they go around?

HENRYK

Don't worry about it, they're about

to build a bridge, haven't you

heard?

THE NERVOUS MAN

A bridge, a schmidge, and the

Germans claim to be intelligent.

You know what I think?  I think

they're totally stupid. I've got a

family to feed and I spend half my

time here waiting for them to let

us through.

THE GERMAN SOLDIER

Dance!

SOLDIERS

Faster! Go on, faster! Dance!

SOLDIERS

Dance! Dance!

MOTHER

Good, they're here. Yitzchak

Heller's been waiting for you,

Henryk.

HENRYK

What's this about?

MOTHER

Sit down, have tea, I'll start

lunch when the girls get back.

HENRYK

So, what are you doing here?

FATHER

He brought cakes.

FATHER

His father's back in the jewellery

business and doing well, isn't

that so, Yitzchak? Amazing.

Jewellery.

HELLER

We're recruiting.

HENRYK

Who's recruiting?

HELLER

Don't be clever with me, Henryk.

I've come here as a friend. They're

bringing Jews in from all over the

country. Soon there'll be half a

million people in the ghetto. We

need more Jewish police...

HENRYK

(sarcastic)

Oh? More Jewish police? You mean

you want me to wear a cap like

yours, beat up Jews with my

truncheon and catch the Gestapo

spirit. I see!

HELLER

(eyes narrowed,

dangerous)

Someone's got to do it, Henryk.

HENRYK

But why me? I thought you only

recruited boys with rich fathers.

Look at my father, look at us, I

mean...

HELLER

(interrupting,

flaring)

Yes, I'm looking at you and that's

why I'm here. Your whole family

can have a better life. You want

to go on struggling for survival,

selling books on the street?

HENRYK

(a smile)

Yes, please.

HELLER

(to Szpilman)

I'm doing you people a favour. And

what about you, Wladek? You're a

great pianist. And we've got an

excellent police jazz band. They'd

welcome you with open arms. Join

us. You've got no work...

SZPILMAN

Thank you. But I've got work.

BENEK

(whispering into

Szpilman's ear)

I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you

to stop.

SZPILMAN

(continuing to play)

Who wants me to stop?

2ND CHILD

Help me! help me!

JEHUDA

I always say look on the bright

side. You're in the small ghetto,

intellectuals, professional people,

you're better off than us. Here,

in the large ghetto, it's a

cesspool. But you, you're living

in Monte Carlo. You could say you're

privileged and that, of course,

goes against my principles.

Nevertheless...

JEHUDA

Ah, here. Today's news from the

other side.

SZPILMAN

You're amazing, Jehuda.

JEHUDA

No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers

everywhere. They bring me news and

food. We care about our fellow

human beings. Workers of the world

unite.

SZPILMAN

So, what's the news?

JEHUDA

(scanning the paper)

The Germans are advancing on

Kharkhov.

SZPILMAN

I don't know why I come here every

evening, it's always such bad news.

JEHUDA

Bad news, you crazy? You have no

world view, Wladek, that's your

trouble. The news couldn't be

better. The moment Hitler invaded

Russia, I knew we'd be all right.

Remember Napoleon. Same business.

The Germans will freeze to death,

please God.

SZPILMAN

Jehuda, give me something to do.

JEHUDA

You're an artist, Wladek, you keep

people's spirits up. You do enough.

SZPILMAN

But I want to help, I want to.

JEHUDA

You're too well known, Wladek. And

you know what? You musicians don't

make good conspirators. You're

too...too musical.

SZPILMAN

There are notices going up. The

city's to be cleansed of

undesirables.

JEHUDA

There are always notices going up.

MAJOREK

Hello, Symche, Dolek, Mrs Zyskind,

Jehuda. Working hard?

JEHUDA

Majorek, this is the greatest

pianist in Poland, maybe in the

whole world. Wladyslaw Szpilman.

Meet Majorek.

MAJOREK

(shakes Szpilman's

hand)

I know your name. I've never heard

you play.

JEHUDA

Majorek used to be in the army.

Brilliant man. He's got a mind

like a searchlight. The only thing

I've got against him is he's not a

socialist.

(he looks out of

the window.)

You'd better go now, Wladek. It's

nearly curfew.

(he hands over

pamphlets to

Majorek.)

You see these, Wladek?  You know

how many copies we print of our

newspaper?

JEHUDA

Five hundred. You know how many

people on average read one copy?

Twenty.  That makes ten thousand

readers. These will start the

uprising. Majorek hides them in

his underpants. And leaves them in

toilets.

SZPILMAN

Toilets?

MAJOREK

As many toilets as I can find.

Germans never go into Jewish

toilets. They're too clean for

them.

MOTHER

And, please, tonight, for once, I

don't want anything bad talked

about. Let's enjoy our meal.

HENRYK

Okay, then I'll tell you something

funny. You know who I mean by Dr.

Raszeja.

REGINA

The surgeon?

HENRYK

The surgeon. Well, for some reason,

don't ask me why, the Germans

allowed him into the ghetto to

perform an operation...

HALINA

On a Jew? They allowed a Pole to

come in to operate on a Jew?

HENRYK

He got a pass, that's all I know.

Anyway, he puts the patient to

sleep and starts the operation.

He'd just made the first incision

when the SS burst in, shoot the

patient lying on the table, and

then shoot Dr. Raszeja and everybody

else who was there. Isn't that a

laugh? The patient didn't feel a

thing, he was anaesthetised -

MOTHER

Henryk, I said nothing bad.

HENRYK

What's the matter with you all?

Have you lost your sense of humour?

SZPILMAN

It's not funny.

HENRYK

Well, you know what's funny? You're

funny with that ridiculous tie.

SZPILMAN

What are you talking about, my

tie? What's my tie got to do with

anything? I need the tie for my

work.

MOTHER

Boys, boys...

HENRYK

Your work, yes, playing the piano

for all the parasites in the ghetto,

they don't give a damn about

people's sufferings, they don't

even notice what's going on around

them!

FATHER

I blame the Americans.

SZPILMAN

For what? For my tie?

FATHER

American Jews, and there's lots of

them, what have they done for us?

What do they think they're doing?

People here are dying, haven't got

a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers

over there should be persuading

America to declare war on Germany!

NCO

(in a towering rage)

Stand up!

NCO

Stand up!

REGINA

(softly, to Mother)

Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake, be

quiet!

A GERMAN VOICE

Run!  Run!

SZPILMAN

What's happened?

HALINA

(almost incoherent)

Oh my God, it's terrible, you've

got to do something, oh my God!

SZPILMAN

(shaking her)

Calm down, what, what is it?

HALINA

They're hunting people on the

streets. They've picked up Henryk.

THE FEATHER WOMAN

Excuse me, but have you seen my

husband Izaak Szerman?

SZPILMAN

I'm afraid not.

THE FEATHER WOMAN

He's tall, he's handsome. He has a

little grey beard. If you see him,

please do write, Izaak Szerman's

his name, don't forget.

SZPILMAN

(to an elderly man

nearest him)

What's happening?

THE ELDERLY MAN

They've got my grandson in there.

They pick 'em up, they take 'em

away. What do they do to them?

I've stopped believing in God!

SZPILMAN

(yelling)

Yitzchak!

SZPILMAN

Yitzchak!

SZPILMAN

Here, please! Wladek Szpilman!

SZPILMAN

Henryk's in there.

HELLER

I haven't seen him.

SZPILMAN

Believe me, they've picked him up.

HELLER

Tough luck.

SZPILMAN

Can you help?

HELLER

Oh, you need me now, yes, now you

need me!

SZPILMAN

Can you help us?

HELLER

It costs.

SZPILMAN

I've no money.

HELLER

Then there's nothing I can do. He

should've joined us when I gave

him the chance..

SZPILMAN

Yitzchak, they told me you had

influence.

HELLER

Who told you?

SZPILMAN

People I know. They said you're an

important man.

POOR WOMAN

(screaming)

A snatcher! Help me, a snatcher!

RUBINSTEIN'S VOICE

Boys, keep your peckers up! And

girls, keep your legs crossed!

RUBINSTEIN

Don't let 'em get you down -

RUBINSTEIN

Bandits! Crooks!  Thieves!

1ST SHUPO

Good day, Herr Rubinstein.

RUBINSTEIN

If that means good day, I'm your

man, you gangsters, robbers,

pirates!

2ND SHUPO

(tapping his head)

Mad!

RUBINSTEIN

Ich bin meshuge, you bandit!

HENRYK

(immediately on the

attack, furious)

You go to Heller, did I ask you to

talk to him?

SZPILMAN

You're out, aren't you?

HENRYK

Did you beg, did you grovel to

that piece of shit, that cockroach?

SZPILMAN

I didn't grovel, I asked him to

help.

HENRYK

What did you pay him?

SZPILMAN

Pay him? With what? With what could

I pay him? Every zloty I earn we

spend on food!

HENRYK

I can look after myself!

SZPILMAN

They were taking you away.

HENRYK

It's nothing to do with you. It's

me they wanted, not you. Why do

you interfere in other people's

business?

SZPILMAN

You're mad, that's your trouble,

you're mad.

HENRYK

That's also my business.

SZPILMAN

What's the matter? Are you sick?

HENRYK

Hungry.

SZPILMAN

What's that mean, no employment

certificate?

HENRYK

You have to have an employment

certificate to work for one of the

German firms in the ghetto,

otherwise...

SZPILMAN

Otherwise what?

HENRYK

You'll be deported.

BENEK

So the rumours were true...

HENRYK

They're going to resettle us. Send

us to labour camps. In the east.

And they're closing the small

ghetto.

JEHUDA

Wladek!

JEHUDA

I thought you'd be off on tour,

playing London, Paris, New York?

SZPILMAN

(trying to smile)

Not this week.

JEHUDA

I have to say you look terrible.

What's the trouble?

SZPILMAN

You've heard the rumours they're

going to resettle us in the East?

JEHUDA

(dismissing him)

Rumours, rumours, you take it all

too much to heart, Wladek.

SZPILMAN

I've been trying to get a

certificate of employment for my

father. I've managed to get

certificates for me and the rest

of the family but I need one more

for my father. I've been trying

all the firms, the shops...

JEHUDA

Why didn't you come to me?

SZPILMAN

I didn't know you were in the

certificate business.

JEHUDA

I'm not, but Majorek is.

SZPILMAN

(to Majorek)

Can you help? I've no money...

JEHUDA

Please, don't insult us.

(to Majorek)

Can you do something for him?

MAJOREK

Be at the Schultz Workshop,

tomorrow, four o'clock.

JEHUDA

You see what a wonderful piece of

luck you've had today? That's die

historical imperative in action

and that's why I always say, look

on...

SZPILMAN

(joining with him)

...the bright side, yes, I know.

FATHER

(doffing his hat)

Thank you.

SCHULTZ

(beaming, German

accent)

My pleasure. It won't help you

anyway.

FATHER

At least we've got work in the

ghetto. At least we're still

together.

NCO

Out! Assemble in the yard!

SZPILMAN

We're employed here, we've got

certificates -

NCO

The rest of you get dressed then

report back here. Bring your

belongings. Fifteen kilos only.

A YOUNG WOMAN

Where are you taking us?

SZPILMAN

I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought

the certificates would save us

all.

MOTHER

Stop it, Wladek.

REGINA

Let's just hope that Henryk and

Halina will be better off -

REGINA

(to a Jewish

policeman)

Where will we be going?

JEWISH POLICEMAN #1

You're going to work. You'll be

much better off than in this

stinking ghetto. The gates are

JEWISH POLICEMAN #2

Move!

SZPILMAN

Let's sit over there.

THE YOUNG WOMAN

Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

THE YOUNG WOMAN

Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

WOMAN WITH CHILD

He's dying, don't you have a drop

of water? My child's dying of

thirst, he's dying, he's dying, I

beg you!

A MAN'S VOICE

I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.

FATHER

I can hear you.

DR. EHRLICH

(overlapping)

We're letting them take us to our

death like sheep to the slaughter!

FATHER

Dr. Ehrlich, not so loud!

DR. EHRLICH

Why don't we attack them? There's

half a million of us, we could

break out of the ghetto. At least

we could die honourably, not as a

stain on the face of history!

GRUN

Why you so sure they're sending us

to our death?

DR. EHRLICH

I'm not sure. You know why I'm not

sure? Because they didn't tell me.

But I'm telling you they plan to

wipe us all out!

FATHER

Dr. Ehrlich, what do you want me

to do? You want me to fight?

GRUN

To fight you need organisation,

plans, guns!

FATHER

He's right. What d'you think I can

do? Fight them with my violin bow?

GRUN

The Germans would never squander a

huge labour force like this. They're

sending us to a labour camp.

DR. EHRLICH

Oh, sure. Look at that cripple,

look at those old people, the

children, they're going to work?

Look at Mr Szpilman here, he's

going to carry iron girders on his

back?

MOTHER

Henryk!

REGINA

(glancing up, shocked)

Oh my God!

MOTHER

Halina! Henryk!

HALINA

We heard you were here...we...didn't

want...we...we wanted to be with

you.

SZPILMAN

(shakes his head,

almost to himself,

a forlorn smile)

Stupid, stupid!

THE YOUNG WOMAN

Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

THE YOUNG WOMAN

Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

HALINA

She's getting on my nerves. What

did she do, for God's sake?

GRUN

(quietly, to Halina)

She smothered her baby.

GRUN

They'd prepared a hiding place and

so, of course, they went there.

But the baby cried just as the

police came. She smothered the

cries with her hands. The baby

died. A policeman heard the death

rattle. He found where they were

hiding.

SZPILMAN

What are you reading?

HENRYK

(a crooked, ironic

smile)

'If you prick us, do we not bleed?

If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

If you poison us, do we not die?

And if you wrong us, shall we not

revenge?'

SZPILMAN

Very appropriate.

HENRYK

(taking the book

back and resuming

his reading)

Yes, that's why I brought it.

HENRYK

Idiot. What's he think he's going

to do with the money?

FATHER

How much for a caramel?

THE SWEET BOY

Twenty zlotys.

FATHER

What? For one caramel? What d'you

think you're going to do with the

money?

THE SWEET BOY

Twenty zlotys.

FATHER

(turning to the

family)

Have we got twenty between us?

SZPILMAN

Halina?

HALINA

What?

SZPILMAN

Funny time to say this.

HALINA

What?

SZPILMAN

wish I knew you better.

HALINA

(a smile)

Thanks.

A VOICE

Szpilman! Szpilman!

SZPILMAN

(yelling)

Papa!

SZPILMAN

(desperate)

Papa! Mama! Halina!

HELLER

What do you think you're doing,

Szpilman? I've saved your life!

Now, go on, save yourself!

HELLER

Don't run!

JEWISH POLICEMAN

Well, off they go for meltdown!

BENEK

(looking at him,

mystified)

Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?

SZPILMAN

It's like this... I...we...all of

them.

BENEK

Perhaps they're lucky. The quicker

the better.

(Brief pause.)

It isn't over yet. We'll stay here

for a couple of days. Until things

die down.

(Another pause)

I've bribed a policeman. He'll

come when it's over.

SZPILMAN

(to Benek)

My God. I haven't been outside for -

it must be two years.

FELLOW WORKER

(on the other side

of him)

Don't get over-excited.

DEALERS

Gold, buy gold! Dollars! Roubles!

THE YOUNG WOMAN

Look - oh, do look!

THE YOUNG WOMAN

Jews!

THE YOUNG MAN

Can't be the first time you've

ever seen Jews.

BENEK

Someone you know?

SZPILMAN

Yes.

BENEK

A beauty. Who is she?

SZPILMAN

A singer. Her husband's an actor.

I knew them well. Good people. I'd

like to talk to her.

BENEK

(playful)

Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they

hang them for helping Jews.

YOUNG SS MAN

Halt!

YOUNG SS MAN

Lie down!

SZPILMAN

How long have you been here?

MAJOREK

Since last night. I was pleased to

see you.

MAJOREK

They're going to start the final

resettlement now. We know what it

means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt.

A good man. His orders were to

follow the trains out of Warsaw.

He got to Sokolow. A local

railwayman told him the tracks are

divided, one branch leading to

Treblinka. He said every day freight

trains carrying people from Warsaw

forked to Treblinka and returned

empty. No transports of food are

ever seen on that line. And

civilians are forbidden to approach

the Treblinka station. They're

exterminating us. Won't take them

long. We're sixty thousand left.

Out of half a million. Mostly young

people. And this time we're going

to fight. We're in good shape.

We're organised. We're prepared.

SZPILMAN

If you need help...

ZICK-ZACK

You!

ZICK-ZACK

Here!

ZICK-ZACK

(with every stroke,

hissing through

clenched teeth)

Und-zick! Und-zack! Und-zick! Und-

zack!

ZICK-ZACK

Get him away from here.

BARTCZAK

Hope you played the piano better

than you carry bricks.

POLISH WORKMAN

He won't last long if he goes on

like this.

BARTCZAK

I'll see if I can get him something

better.

WORKER

(hissing)

Trouble.

A GERMAN VOICE

Assemble! Fall in! Only the Jews!

Poles go on working! Only the Jews!

Poles go on working!

SS CAPTAIN

(in English)

I have important and good news for

you. There are rumours circulating

that resettlement measures are

again going to be taken.

SS CAPTAIN

(in English)

I want to assure you personally

that no such measures will be taken

now or in the future. Posters will

be going up also to this effect.

As proof of our good will, we want

you to select a delegate, who will

be permitted to go into town once

a day to buy, on each worker's

behalf, five kilos of potatoes and

one loaf of bread, which you will

be allowed to take back into the

ghetto. Now, why would we do that

j if we meant to resettle you?

SS CAPTAIN

(in English)

You can do good business on what

you don't eat. Isn't that what you

Jews are best at? Making 'geld'?

SS CAPTAIN

(in English)

Carry on.

MAJOREK

(under his breath)

The smaller one. At the bottom.

SZPILMAN

(whispered)

Majorek!

SZPILMAN

Have a favour to ask. I want to

get out of here.

MAJOREK

It's easy to get out, it's how you

survive on the other side that's

hard.

SZPILMAN

I know. But last summer, I worked

for a day in Zelazna Brama Square.

I saw someone I knew. A singer.

Her husband's an actor. They're

old friends. (

(He holds out the "

piece of paper.)

I've written their names down. And

their address. If they're still

there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej

Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you

go into the town every day. Would

you try and make contact? Ask them

if they'd help me get out of here?

SS LIEUTENANT

Any fucking plaster?

SS LIEUTENANT'S VOICE

(while he applies

the plaster to his

finger)

What were you up to?

Nothing from Szpilman.

SS LIEUTENANT'S VOICE

What the fuck are those?

SZPILMAN

(in German)

We're allowed to take food into

the ghetto. Five kilos of potatoes

and a...

SS LIEUTENANT

Open it.

SZPILMAN

It's only potatoes and bread.

SS LIEUTENANT

Fuck that, you're lying, I can

smell it. Open it.

SS LIEUTENANT

You're all the same. Give a Jew a

little finger, he takes the whole

hand.

SS LIEUTENANT

You lie to me again and I'll shoot

you personally.

MAJOREK

I tried your friends. They're not

at that address any more.  But.

SZPILMAN

You made contact?

MAJOREK

Be ready to leave in two days'

time. Same place as last night.

SZPILMAN

Oh, shit!

ZICK-ZACK

Und-zick! Und-zack!

ZICK-ZACK

(shouting")

I'll soon teach you discipline!

Jew pigs!

ZICK-ZACK

Know why we beat you?

ZICK-ZACK

Know why we beat you?

SZPILMAN

(tentatively, in

German)

No. Why?

ZICK-ZACK

To celebrate New Year's Eve!

ZICK-ZACK

Now, march! Go on, march!

ZICK-ZACK

And sing!

(he belches.)

Sing something cheerful!

(laughs.)

And sing it good and loud!

ALL WORKERS

(singing)

Hey, ranks unite

And follow the White Eagle!

Stand up and fight

Our mortal enemy.

Riflemen, hey!

Let's give them fire and brimstone.

We'll blow away

The yoke of slavery.

Punish and rout

The rapists of our nation.

We'll smash the knout

To save our dignity.

Soon we'll be proud

Of our liberation -

Hey, take your sights!

Aim sharply at the heart.

Hey, load! Hey, shoot!

Hey, load! Hey, shoot!

Give 'em a bloody start!

Hey, load! Hey, shoot!

Aim sharply at the heart.

GERMAN VOICES

Get on with it and fall in! Fall

in!

BOGUCKI

We haven't much time.

BOGUCKI

You must hurry.

BOGUCKI

We're going to have to keep moving

you. The Germans are hunting down

indiscriminately now. Jews, non-

Jews, anybody, everybody.

(handing him the

clothes')

See if these fit. And, Wladek,

you'd better shave. Use my razor.

In the cabinet.

SZPILMAN

Thank you, I don't.

BOGUCKI

You'll be looked after by Mr

Gebczynski. He's on the other side

of town. You'll stay there tonight.

Then we'll find you somewhere else.

JANINA

I'll bring you food.

BOGUCKI

Let's go.

GEBCZYNSKI

I'll show you where you're going

to sleep.

GEBCZYNSKI

It's not going to be very

comfortable.

SZPILMAN

I'll be fine.

GEBCZYNSKI

You'll have to stay here until

tomorrow afternoon.

GEBCZYNSKI

We've got a flat for you. Near the

ghetto wall. But it's safe.

GEBCZYNSKI

(quietly, to Szpilman)

Go as near to the front as possible,

to the German section.

GERMANS ONLY

GEBCZYNSKI

Must feel better this side of the

wall.

SZPILMAN

Yes, but sometimes I'm still not

sure which side of the wall I'm

on.

GEBCZYNSKI

Here.

GEBCZYNSKI

I'll come again. And Janina Bogucki

will visit twice a week. Bring

more food. See how you are.

GEBCZYNSKI

Yes, now, this is very important.

In case of emergency, I mean

emergency, go to this address.

KITTEN'S VOICE

(angry)

Puppydog, what d'you mean, you

forgot?

PUPPYDOG'S VOICE

What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I

forgot, that's what I mean.

KITTEN'S VOICE

You know what? You treat me like

dirt!

PUPPYDOG'S VOICE

I treat you like dirt because you

are dirt.

KITTEN'S VOICE

Pig!

PUPPYDOG'S VOICE

Cow!

KITTEN'S VOICE

Pig!

PUPPYDOG'S VOICE

Bitch!

KITTEN'S VOICE

Dirty pig!

PUPPYDOG'S VOICE

You're a dirty pig!

KITTEN'S VOICE

Takes one to know one! Pig!

PUPPYDOG'S VOICE

You play like an angel, Kitten.

KITTEN'S VOICE

If I play like an angel, why don't

you listen?

PUPPYDOG'S VOICE

I was listening, Kitten.

KITTEN'S VOICE

Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!

PUPPYDOG'S VOICE

(wheedling)

Kitten, let me in.

JANINA

wanted to come earlier but...

SZPILMAN

Thank you.

JANINA

No one thought they'd hold out so

long.

SZPILMAN

should never have come out. I

should've stayed there, fought

with them.

JANINA

(turning to him)

Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

Just be proud it happened. My God,

did they put up a fight.

SZPILMAN

Yes, so did the Germans.

JANINA

They're in shock. They didn't expect

it. Nobody expected it. Jews

fighting back? Who'd have thought?

SZPILMAN

Yes, but what good did it do?

JANINA

(passionate)

What good? Wladek, I'm surprised

at you. They died with  dignity,

that's what good it did. And you

know something else?  Now the Poles

will rise. We're ready. We'll fight,

too. You'll see.

GEBCZYNSKI

Get your things together, you have

to leave!

SZPILMAN

What's happened?

GEBCZYNSKI

I'm on the run!

SZPILMAN

What's happened?

GEBCZYNSKI

The Gestapo found our weapons.

They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

They're bound to find out about

this place, too - you must get

away at once.

SZPILMAN

Where do you want me to go?  Look

at me. No, no, I'm not leaving.

Can't I take my chances here?

GEBCZYNSKI

That's your decision.

(Stubs out cigarette.)

But when they storm the flat, throw

yourself out of die window - don't

let them get you alive. I have

poison on me, they won't get me

alive either!

KITTY'S VOICE

Open this door at once, or we'll

call the police!

KITTY

Are you from the flat in there?

You're not registered.

SZPILMAN

It belongs to a friend of mine. I

came to visit but I must have just

missed him.

KITTY

(shouting)

Have you got your identity card?

Let me see your identity card!

KITTY

I want to see your identity card!

KITTY

(screeching)

He's a Jew! He's a Jew! Stop the

Jew! Don't let him out!

WOMAN'S VOICE

(from behind the

door)

Yes?

SZPILMAN

Mr Gebczynski sent me.

DOROTA

(a whisper)

Wladyslaw Szpilman.

SZPILMAN

Dorota.

DOROTA

Come in! come in!

DOROTA

Sit.

SZPILMAN

I'm sorry - I was given this

address. I'm looking for a Mr--

(He checks the scrap

of paper.')

-- a Mr Dzikiewicz.

DOROTA

(nodding)

Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.

SZPILMAN

I need help.

DOROTA

He'll be back before curfew.

SZPILMAN

I've been in hiding. I need

somewhere to stay.

DOROTA

He'll be here soon.

SZPILMAN

How long have you been married?

DOROTA

Just over a year.

SZPILMAN

And how's Yurek?

DOROTA

Dead.

SZPILMAN

When's your baby due?

DOROTA

Christmas.

(A pause.)

This is not a good time to have

children. But then...

DOROTA

This is my husband. Wladyslaw

Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent

him.

MICHAL

Oh, yes. I remember.

SZPILMAN

Mr Gebczynski said to contact you

only in an emergency, but...

MICHAL

Don't worry now. We can't move you

tonight.

MICHAL

You'll sleep on the sofa.

SZPILMAN

Excuse me, could I have a piece of

bread?

MICHAL

Yes, of course, we'll eat.

MICHAL

(in whisper)

You're in a very German area. The

building opposite is a hospital,

taking in wounded from the Russian

front. Next door is the

Schutzpolizei. It's the safest

place to be. Right in the centre

of the lion's den.

MICHAL

I'll be locking you in. No one

knows you're here. So keep as quiet

as possible.

MICHAL

All well?

SZPILMAN

Thank you.

MICHAL

This is Antek Szalas.

MICHAL

He's going to look after you. I've

given him a second key. He'll bring

you food. See that you're all right.

He's with the underground, a good

man.

SZALAS

You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?

SZPILMAN

No, I don't think so?

SZALAS

Warsaw Radio. I was a technician.

I saw you almost every day.

SZPILMAN

Sorry, I don't remember.

SZALAS

Doesn't matter. You've nothing to

worry about. I'll visit often.

MICHAL

And you'll be pleased to hear the

Allies are bombing Germany night

after night - Cologne, Hamburg,

Berlin.

SZALAS

And the Russians are really giving

them hell. It's the beginning of

the end.

MICHAL

Let's hope so. I don't know when

I'll see you again?

SZALAS

Still alive then, are you? Here.

Sausage. Bread.

SZPILMAN

How long is this meant to last?

SZPILMAN

think I've got jaundice.

SZALAS

You don't want to worry about that.

My grandfather was jilted by his

girl friend when he got jaundice.

(chuckles.)

In my opinion, jaundice is not

very serious. Drink up.

SZPILMAN

Why didn't you come sooner? It's

been over two weeks.

SZALAS

Problems. Money. I've got to raise

money to buy the food. I need things

to sell, it' s not easy.

SZPILMAN

Sell this. Food's more important

than time.

SZALAS

Oh, yes. I meant to tell you. The

Allies have landed in France. The

Russians'll be here soon. They'll

beat the shit out of the Germans.

Any day now.

DOROTA

Wladek? Wladek!

(to Michal)

I knew it, I knew this would happen!

DOROTA

I'm going to get a doctor.

MICHAL

You can't, it's too dangerous.

DOROTA

I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust

him.

MICHAL

Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's

a pediatrician.

DOROTA

He's still a doctor.

MICHAL

No, you stay, I'll go.

DOROTA

We came to say goodbye. We're going

to stay with my mother in Otwock.The

baby's already there. It's safer.

There's talk that the uprising

will begin any day now.

DOROTA

That man Szalas should be shot.

He's been collecting money on your

behalf all over Warsaw. Apparently,

people gave generously. So he

collected a tidy sum. He told us

he was visiting you daily.

DOROTA

Oh God!

DOCTOR

Acute inflammation of the gall

bladder. Liver the size of a

football. But he'll live. I'll try

to get hold of some levulose, but

it's not easy.

DOROTA

Can you visit him again?

DOCTOR

Who knows?

SZPILMAN

Doctor, thank you.

DOCTOR

Don't speak. Rest.

DOROTA

Michal brought food. I'll prepare

something now for you, then we

must go.

VOICES

(confused)

Where? Where? Just get out!

Everywhere! Get out into the street!

A MAN'S VOICE

Get out now! The Germans have

surrounded the building! They're

going to blow us to pieces.

THE MAN'S VOICE

(further off)

Everyone out, please! Leave your

flats at once, please!

GERMAN VOICE

Fourth floor, Fischke!

GERMAN VOICE

At the double, Fischke!

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

(stern)

Who the hell are you?

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Who are you?

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

What the hell are you doing?

SZPILMAN

(barely audible, in

German)

I was... I was trying to open this

tin.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Where do you live?

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

What's your work?

SZPILMAN

I am... I was a pianist.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

A pianist.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Play.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Are you hiding here?

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Jew?

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Where are you hiding?

SZPILMAN

(in German)

In the attic.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Show me.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Have you anything to eat?

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

I'll bring you something.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Open up.

SZPILMAN

Please.

SZPILMAN

What's all that gunfire?

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

The Russians. On the other side of

the river.

(Turns to leave,

stops; with a touch

of irony:)

All you have to do is hang on for

a few more weeks.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Come down.

SZPILMAN

What's happening?

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

We're getting out.

SZPILMAN

(in German)

Are the Russians here?

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Not yet.

SZPILMAN

I don't know how to thank you.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Don't thank me. Thank God. It's

His will that we should survive.

Well. That's what we have to

believe.

SZPILMAN

What about you?

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

I've got another one.  Warmer.

(brief pause)

What will you do when it's all

over?

SZPILMAN

I'll play the piano again. On Polish

radio.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Tell me your name. I'll listen out

for you.

SZPILMAN

Szpilman.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

Szpilman.

(a crooked smile)

Good name for a pianist.

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE

...German army! Polish soil

liberated!  Official!

THE WOMAN

German! German!

SZPILMAN

(shouting)

Stop, for God's sake, I beg you,

I'm Polish!

SZPILMAN

Don't shoot! I'm Polish!

1ST POLISH OFFICER

He's Polish!

2ND POLISH OFFICER

(yelling)

Come out with your hands up.

SZPILMAN

(obeying)

Don't shoot! I'm Polish! Please,

please! I'm Polish!

1ST POLISH OFFICER

Yes, he's Polish!

2ND POLISH OFFICER

(as Szpilman

approaches')

Why the fucking coat?

SZPILMAN

I'm cold.

2ND POLISH OFFICER

Take him to headquarters.

1ST MAN

Look at them - bastards!

2ND MAN

German fuckers!

3RD MAN

I prayed for this, never thought

I'd see it.

LEDNICKI

Murderers! Assassins!  Look at you

now! You took everything I had!

Me, a musician!

(wagging his finger

fiercely)

You took my violin! You took my

soul!

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

(urgent) (in German)

Do you happen to know another

musician, a Mr Szpilman? A pianist!

Polish radio?

LEDNICKI

Yes, of course, I know Szpilman.

THE GERMAN CAPTAIN

(desperate)

I helped Mr Szpilman when he was

in hiding. Tell him I'm here. Ask

him to help me...

RUSSIAN GUARD

(to Lednicki, in

Russian)

Hey! No talking to the prisoners.

Get away from there!

LEDNICKI

(as he backs away,

calling)

What's your name?

LEDNICKI

What?

LEDNICKI

It was here, I'm certain of it.

SZPILMAN

It's not here now.

LEDNICKI

I shouted abuse at them, I'm not

proud of it, but that's what I

did, and, I'm certain, I stood

where you are now. There was barbed

wire, and this German came up to

me.

SZPILMAN

You didn't catch his name.

LEDNICKI

No. I'll ask at the factory. They

may know something.

IT WAS LATER DISCOVERED THAT

THE NAME OF THE GERMAN OFFICER

WAS CAPTAIN WILM HOSENFELD.

ALL THAT IS KNOWN IS THAT HE DIED IN

A SOVIET PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP IN 1952.

WLADYSLAW SZPILMAN CONTINUED TO LIVE

IN WARSAW UNTIL HIS DEATH ON 6 JULY 2OOO.

HE WAS EIGHTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD.

FADE OUT:

THE END
