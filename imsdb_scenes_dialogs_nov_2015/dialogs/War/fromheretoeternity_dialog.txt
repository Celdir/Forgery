LONG SHOT

LEGEND:

HAWAII, 1941

SIX MONTHS BEFORE

PEARL HARBOR

MEDIUM SHOT

MAGGID

Fine way to pass the time. Good for

the mind.

PREW

Hello, Maggio.

MAGGIO

Prew...?

PREW

(NODS)

I transferred out of Fort Shatter.

MAGGIO

You quit the Bugle Corps...?

2.

MAGGIO

To here...?

PREW

(SHRUGS)

That's what the orders say.

MAGGIO

You made a bad mistake. This outfit

they can give back to Custer.

MAGGIO

The Captain ain't in yet.

PREY

I'll look around.

MAGGIO

(smiles for first time)

Maybe we borrow some money from a

twenty per cent man and take a real

trip to town some night.

PHEW

Maybe.

MEDIUM SHOT

WARDEN'S VOICE (O. S.)

What're you think you're doing!?

Why ain't you out in the field with

the Compny? What's your name?

PREW

Prewitt. Transfer from Shafter.

WARDEN

Yeah. I heard about you.

PREW

I heard about you, too, Warden.

WARDEN

Well, put up that cue and come

along. This here's a rifle outfit,

Prewitt. You ain't suppose to enjoy

yourself before sundown. The Man's

very particlar about little things

like that.

TRUCKING SHOT

MEDIUM SHOT

WARDEN

Mazzioli! Grant went to the

hospital yesterday. Did you make up

his sick record? Did you make a

note for the morning report?!

You're the Compny Clerk. The lousy

Sickbook is your job!

4.

MAZZIOLI

Those medics didn't get the

Sickbook back till late yesterday --

I'll tend to it right now --

WARDEN

Thanks. I already done it for you.

ANOTHER ANGLE

MAGGIO

But you the beat bugler they got

over at Shatter. You probly the

best on this whole Rock.

PREW

That's true.

MAGGIO

Well, friend, I feel for you. But

from my position I can't quite

reach you.

WARDEN

Ten-sh-HUT!

HOLMES

At ease. Good morning, men.

Anything special this morning,

Sergeant Warden? I've only a few

minutes.

WARDEN

New man here, sir.

HOLMES

Oh, yes. Bring him in.

5.

PREWITT

Sir, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt

reporting to the Compny Commander

as ordered.

HOLMES

At ease.

(takes papers out of

drawer, glances through

THEM)

They sent your service record

over... Twenty-two years of age...

born in Kentucky... enlisted first

at Fort Myer, Virginia... Bugle

Corps... re-enlisted for overseas

duty... Fort Shafter... First

Bugler...

(BENIGNLY)

Prewitt, I always make it a policy

to talk to my new men. It's

important for an officer and his

men to understand each other. Now I

have a fine smooth-running outfit.

HOLMES

Plenty of room for advancement for

a man who knows how to soldier. But

he's got to show me he's got it on

the ball. I don't know what you've

been used to in the Bugle Corps,

but in my outfit we run it by the

book. What kind of trouble were you

in over there?

6.

PREW

No trouble, sir.

HOLMES

What made you transfer out, then?

PREW

It's a personal matter, air.

HOLMES

Oh. I see...

HOLMES

Something you wanted to ask,

Sergeant?

WARDEN

(EXPLODES SUDDENLY)

Who? Me? Whv, yes, air. You had

Corpral's stripes in the Bugle

Corps, Prewitt. You took a bust to

buck Private to transfer to an

Infantry Compny. Why? Because you

like to hike?

PREW

I dint have no trouble if that's

what you mean.

WARDED

(GRINS SUDDENLY)

Or was it just because you couldn't

stand to bugle?

PREW

It was a personal matter.

WARDEN

That's up to the Compny Commander's

discretion to decide.

PREW

(looks straight at Warden)

All right. I was First Bugler at

Shafter for two years. The topkick

had a friend who transferred in

from the states. Next day he made

him First Bugler over me.

7.

WARDEN

And you asked out on account of

that!?

PREY

Maybe I just ain't sensible... But

that's the reason.

WARDEN

(SNORTS)

His feelings were hurt! Kids they

send us now!

HOLMES

I've got a mighty sour Company

Bugler here... but I suppose you

wouldn't want that job.

PREY

No, air.

HOLMES

(SMILES)

Well, we'll get your stripes back

for you, maybe an extra one for

good measure. You know why you were

sent over here when you requested

transfer?

PREW

No, sir.

HOLDS

I pulled a few strings. I'm the

Regimental Boxing Coach, Prewitt. I

saw your fight with Connors in the

Bowl year before last. With any

luck you should have won it. I

thought for a while, in the second

round, you were going to knock him

out.

PREW

(TENSE)

Thank you, sir.

8.

HOLMES

(BITTERLY)

My Regiment got beaten last year in

the finals, as you know.

(SAVAGE INSISTENCE)

But I mean to win this year. And I

will. All I've needed was a top

middleweight.

(waves at pictures)

Next year I'll hang your picture up

there with the others, my boy.

PREW

I'm sorry, air. But I quit

fighting.

HOLMES.

Quit fighting? When? What for?

PREW

I just stopped, sir... After --

Maybe you heard about what

happened...

HOLMEB

You mean that fallow you hurt --

the one that went blind?

MEDIUM SHOT

HOLMES

Yes, it's too bad about that. I can

understand how you feel. But those

things happen in this game. A man

has got to accept that possibility

when he fights.

PREW

That's why I decided I would quit,

sir.

HOLMES

(LESS WARMLY)

But on the other hand, look at

(MORE)

9.

HOLMES(CONT'D)

it this way. What if all fighters

felt like that?

PREW

They don't.

HOLMES

Would you have us disband our

fighting program because one man

got hurt?

PREW

No, sir. I dint say --

HOLMES

You might as well say stop war

because one man got killed. Our

fighting program is the best morale

builder we have off here away from

home.

PREW

I don't want it disbanded, sir.

(DOGGEDLY)

But I don't see why any man should

fight unless he wants to.

HOLMES

It looks to me like you're trying

to acquire a reputation as a lone

wolf, Prewitt. You should know that

in the Army it's not the individual

that counts. If a man wants to get

ahead he has certain

responsibilities to fulfill that go

beyond the regulations. It might

look as though I were a free agent,

but I'm not. Nobody is.

HOLMES

Maybe you'll change your mind. In

the meantime just don't make any

mistakes in my outfit.

(TO WARDEN)

I've got to go into town. Is there

anything else for me today,

Sergeant?

10.

WARDEN

(holds up papers)

Yea, sir! The Compny Pond Report's

got to be made out. It's due

TOMORROW --

HOLMES

You make it out. Is that all?

WARDEN

(holds up more papers)

No, sir!

HOLMES

Well, whatever it is, you fix it.

If there's anything that has to go

in this afternoon, sign my name. I

won't be back.

WARDEN

He'd strangle on his own spit if I

weren't here to swab out his throat

for him.

(TO PREW)

Come on. I'll show you the Supply

Room.

MEDIUM SHOT

WARDEN

(one of his unexpected

INTENSE BURSTS)

Know what you did just now?

(MORE)

11.

WARDEN(CONT'D)

When you turned down Dynanite

Holmes' boxing squad? You put your

head in a noose. Things are soft

for a boxer in his Compny.

Otherwise, you better know how to

soljer.

PHEW

I can soljer with any man.

WARDEN

This ain't the Bugle Corps -- this

is straight duty.

PREW

I'll take my chances.

WARDEN

Since when is this place gettin to

be the Royal Hawaiian?

PREW

Who's she?

WARDEN

His wife. Captain Holmes'.

WARDEN

You'll fight, Prewitt. You'll fight

because Captain Holmes got a bee in

his hat he needs a winnin team to

make Mayor. And if you don't do it

for him you'll do it for me. I only

been in this outfit eight months

myself but I learned one thing. My

job is to keep him happy. The more

he's happy the less he bothers me

and the better I run his Compny. So

we know where we stand, don't we,

kid?

PREW

I know where I stand. I don't

believe that's the only way a man

can get along.

(MORE)

12.

PREW(CONT'D)

A man's got to make up his own mind

and go his own way. It he don't,

he's nothin...

WARDEN

Maybe back in the days of the

pioneers a man could go his own

way. But not in our time, kid.

Today you got to play ball. You got

to divide it all by two.

WARDEN

Lava! Can't I once walk by this

Supply Room and find you workin

with both hands!

LEVA

(comes up to door)

I can't do no better on what you

people pay me.

WARDEN

Draw some supplies for this man.

(TO PREW)

That's G Compny barracks over

there. Get rid of your bags and

come back here, and Leva'll find

you a cart to lug your stuff over

in. Save you makin four five trips.

PREW

(surprised, pleased)

Okay.

WARDEN

I just hate to see energy wasted.

Any kind. Besides, you'll be needin

yours.

13.

LEVA

Her and them sweaters.

WARDEN'S VOICE

Army women... They're cold,

they got no more warmth than a

diamond. There's no pleasure in

them...

LEVA'S VOICE

Yeah, but this one knows the

score... Like I been tellin you.

WARDEN'S VOICE

(SARCASTIC)

Is that right?

LEVA'S VOICE

Okay, not around here. But I was

back at Fort Bliss with Holmes.

When they was married only a year

or two. I heard plenty about the

lady then. Plenty.

WARDEN'S VOICE

You heard.

LEVA'S VOICE

Okay, never me. But a lot of them.

I know some of the Use she played

'around with, don't tell me.

WARDEN'S VOICE

I ain't tellin you. You're tellin

me.

KAREN

Good morning, Sergeant.

MEDIUM SHOT

14.

KAREN

I'm looking for my husband.

WARDEN

Captain Holmes just went in town,

ma'am.

KAREN

Oh. Of course, He was to have left

some things for me.

(STUMBLES SLIGHTLY)

That he was to have purchased. Do

you know anything about them?

WARDEN

No, ma'am, I don't. Is there

anythin I can do for you?

KAREN.

No, thanks, Sergeant.

KAREN

He's been telling me quite a bit

about you lately. My husband. He

says you're very efficient.

WARDEN

Yes, ma'am.

KAREN

What is it that makes you so

efficient, Sergeant?

WARDEN

I couldn't help it if I was born

smart, ma'am.

KAREN

I love that. Well, good-bye,

Sergeant.

15.

LEVA

But man, she sure is one, ain't

she?

WARDEN

One what?

LEVA

One woman.

WARDEN

(UNCONVINCINGLY)

I've seen better.

DISSOLVE TO:

HOLMES

I'm sorry I'm so late. And about

dinner, I --

KAREN

It doesn't matter.

HOLMES

-- I got tied up with General

Slater. Bumped into him at the

Officers' Club.

KAREN

Yes? What did the General have to

say?

HOLMES

Success, he said. Success in war,

success in peacetime... And not a

word about my promotion... There

are times I think the Old Man's

just waiting to ship me down...

(slumps into chair)

I've had a bad day all around...

(MORE)

16.

HOLMES(CONT'D)

started right off this morning...

trouble with a new man...

KAREN

If you'd spend less time buttering

Generals and more time with your

Company, maybe you'd get that

promotion.

HOLDS

The Company takes care of itself.

Or my Topkick takes care of it.

KAREN

I went over there this morning

looking for you.

HOLMES

(FLUSTERED)

I had some business to attend to in

town. During the afternoon.

KAREN

(UNEMOTIONALLY)

From the way you look I gather your

business wasn't too successful.

HOLMES

Now what does that mean?

KAREN

Dana. Give me credit for a few

brains.

HOLMES

How many, times do I have to tell

you I haven't any other women

before you'll believe me?

HOLMES VOICE

If it were so, don't you think I'd

admit it? The way things are

between us now? What right have you

to always be accusing me?

KAREN

What right?

TWO SHOT

17.

HOLMES

That again. How long will it be, I

wonder, before I'm allowed to live

that down? After eight years, how

many times do I have to tell you It

Was An Accident?

KAREN

That makes it all right, I suppose!

HOLMES

I didn't say that. I know what it's

done to you, but --

KAREN

You know I hate to talk about it!

HOLM ES

How many times do I have to tell

you I'm sorry, about that? How many

times that I had no way of knowing -

KAREN

You had a way of knowing, Dana. I

want to go to bed. Please get out

of my bedroom.

MAGGIO

Man, what I would not give to have

this character in the corner

poolroom in my home town: I'd dress

him up on overhalls and a straw hat

and put a grass in his teeth, and I

would make a whole mint of ghelt

off him!

WILSON

We'd of won last year if we had a

good middleweight. You box as good

as you used to over at Shatter

we're a cinch this year.

THORNHILL

You ain't forget the Division

champs get ten day furloughs, did

you, son? Ey?

GALOVITCH

You no talk now, Prewitt. But out

in field with us you sing different

song. An don't think you are tough

guy. Quickest way to stockade is

BEING TOUGH

guy.

HENDERSON

You heard him. Better think it

over.

19.

MAGGIO

Lissen, it's his right not to fight

if he don't want. Without bein

kicked around. Now, we playin pool.

Whyn't you take off?

DHOM

You want a busted head, Maggio?

MAGGIO

(SERIOUSLY)

No.

DHOM

Then keep your big nose out

altogether.

(turns back to Prew)

Trainin season starts next week --

PREW

I told you I quit fightin! I'm

through! An that's all she wrote:

You guys want to put the screws on,

go ahead. I can take anything you

hand out!

DHOM

Okay, Prewitt. No halts barred.

PREW

Thanks.

MAGGIO

I just hate to see a good man get

it in the gut.

20.

CHOATE

You might as well get use to it,

kid. You probly be seein it often

before you die.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHO ATE

... oh, sure, we got a few bad non-

coms and we got Dynamite Holmes for

a Captain. But I been around twenty

years in this Army. They even up.

CHOATE

Take A Compny. They got the best

Compny Commander I ever saw. But

their Topkick -- he ain't no

Warden.

WARDEN

Hello, kid. Everythin nice and

comfy?

PREW

Never better.

WARDEN

'at's the lull before the storm,

kid. Set yourself.

21.

PREW

What's the deal with him, anyway? I

can't figure him.

CHOATE

The Warden? He's a wild man. He was

in the 15th when they seen their

action in the Settlement in

Shanghai. I heard about it down in

the Philippes even. He got himself

a DSC and a Purple Heart out of it

but you'd never know it if I dint

tell you. This next war comes,

Warden'll be right in there,

standin up on the skyline, trio to

get himself killed, but nothing

will ever touch him. He'll come

through maddern, wildern, craziern

ever. All I know is he's the best

soljer I ever saw...

FADE OUT.

could mean life or death. You got

you to strip them weapons and put

(holds up stop watch)

Go!

23.

HENDERSON'S VOICE

'at's fair time. Now lemma see you

put it together.

DISSOLVE TO:

HENDERSON

Your rear sight's way off! You'd be

fifty feet off your target at three

hundred yards!

(to others, mockingly)

That's what comes when a soljer

don't know how to assemble a

rifle.

(TO PREW)

You better get down to the track

and carry it around a few times.

Maybe that'll teach you...

Or Reveille either, probably.

WARDEN

Yes, sir.

HOLMES

work.

You ought to get out more yourself,

Warden.

Well, I'm going.

Sergeant?

WARDEN

I try. In my position you have to.

KAREN

(goes to sink, picks up

THE PAPERS)

Are these really important?

WARDEN

Yes. But not important they get

signed today. Tomorrow's okay.

WARDEN

I got carbons of those back at the

office. So it won't be much work to

fix them up.

29.

KAREN

That's what I like about you,

Sergeant. You have confidence. It's

also what I dislike about you.

WARDEN

It's not confidence. It's honesty.

KAREN

Honesty? How did you acquire such

an old-fashioned virtue?

WARDEN

I figgered out one day it was the

shortest distance between two

points.

KAREN

Well, he's clever as well as

virile.

WARDEN

No -- it's just that I hate to see

a beautiful woman goin all to

waste.

KAREN

Waste, did you say? Now that's a

subject I might tell you something

about. There's we. And then there's

waste. Positive and negative. The

negative is sometimes more

interesting... more evil. For

example -- what about the house

without a child? Tell me your

thoughts, Sergeant.

WARDEN

You're going to cry.

KAREN

Not if I can help it.

WARDEN

Please don't cry... I can't stand

to see somebody cry.

30.

KAREN

What are you doing?

WARDEN

I'm leaving. Isn't that what you

want?

KAREN

(SLOWLY)

I don't know, Sergeant. To be

honest, I don't know.

WARDEN

I know a beach near Diamond Head.

Nobody ever goes there. The cars on

the highway pass above and they

never know it's there. You feel

like you used to feel when you were

a kid, hiding by yourself in a

cave, watching the others hunting

you.

KAREN

Maybe... why not?

WARDEN

How about Payday?

KAREN

You don't have to spend money on

me, Sergeant.

WARDEN

I just like to have some on me when

I take out a woman. Can you get

away?

KAREN

Maybe.

31.

WARDEN

I'll be in Kuhio Park. Say, nine

o'clock. Payday.

FADE OUT.

mend have him around before this.

HENDERSON

We've been runnin him pretty hard.

But he don't faze.

HOLMES

Maybe he needs a good dose of The

Treatment.

GALOVITCH

A double dose needs him to be

given.

THORNHILL

The Treatment'll bring that puppy

How do you like straight duty?.

Life in a rifle compny, eh?

PREW

What makes you think I mind it?

WARDEN

I didn't say you minded it, kid. I

just said you looked tard. Drawn to

a fine edge.

PREW

(SMILES BACK)

I don't mind it, Top. It's a great

WARDEN

Well, well, there's a man for you.

I'll see if I can fix you up with a

How you like the garbage detail?

PREW

Thanks, Top, I've had it. You give

it to me Tuesday. Remember?

WARDEN

REMEMBERING)

Well, then, how 'bout street

cleaning detail?

PREW

That, too. Yesterday.

WARDEN

(NODS)

You got a better memory than me.

Guess the best thing to do is leave

you right in the kitchen a while,

huh?

WARDEN

Course if you was an ath-a-leet you

wouldn't have to pull KP. Or any

fatigue duty for that matter...

PREW

(not smiling now)

If you think you can push me into

fightin, Warden, you're wrong. Not

you and Dynamite and The Treatment.

I'm twice the man you are. If you

dint have them stripes I'd take you

out on the green and beat you to a

pulp.

WARDEN

(smile growing bigger)

Don't let the stripes worry you,

kid. I can always take my shirt

off. Take it off right now.

PREW

You'd like that. You could get me a

year in the Stockade for that one,

Okay... so there y'are. Dues all

paid up. Who ya got playin the

piana -- a hippo?

MRS. KIPPER

Angelo, I don't believe I've met

your friend. And you know how I

hate to find you boys in this

condition...

MAGGIO

There. You see. Any time women see

a soldier, think he's drunk. Why?

You know why?

PREW

Because he is.

MRS. KIPPER

Heavy drinking simply doesn't mix

with the entertainment business.

Every respectable place must

consider its future.

PREW

Mrs. Kipfer, ma'am, I give you my

solemn word your future will be

safe with us.

40.

MRS. KIPPER

Angelo is one of my favorites.

Annette, dear, take care of this

gentleman, will you, please?

ANNETTE

It'll be eight bucks, Babyface.

Four for initiation fee, four for

April dues.

PREW

Say, what do I get for it?

ANNETTE

(rattling it off)

Members are entitled to all

privileges of the club which

includes dancing, snack bar, soft

drink bar, and gentlemanly

relaxation with the opposite gender

so long as they are gentlemen and

no hard liquor is permitted.

(takes a breath)

Got it?

PREW

I got it.

FULL SHOT

ANNETTE

... Girls, here's some new poison.

This is Billy and Jean and Nancy.

ANNETTE

Don't tell me the Princess is your

style.

ANNETTE

Meet Suzanne and Roxanne.

ANNETTE

Much as I adore your company, you

must allow me to tear myself away.

I see a few friends at the door.

(SNAPS)

Also I can see I will be of no use

to you much.

42.

LORENE

Would you like to sit down?

PREW

(SITTING)

Oh... sure.

LORENE

I'm Lorene.

PREW

(enchanted by the name)

Lorene...

LORENE

I haven't seen you in here before.

PREW

I dint know about this place till

now. A friend of mine brought me.

We're stationed at Schofield.

LORENE

Oh. Somehow I didn't think you were

a soldier.

PREW

(bridles a bit)

Well, I am. And I'm in for the

whole ride. I'm a thirty-year man.

LORENE

I suppose it's different when a

fellow is going to make a career of

it.

PREW

There ain't anythin wrong with a

soljer that ain't wrong with

everyone else.

43.

LORENE

I like you just the same. I liked

you the minute I saw Annette

bringing you in.

PREW

(MELTS)

Me, too. I mean when I came in. I

saw you over here --

FATSO'S VOICE

I'll play loud as I want, ya little

Wop!

PREW

Friend of mine.

(RISES)

You wait right here for me, will

ya?

LORENE

(SMILES SWEETLY)

Surely.

MAGGIO

Mess with me, Fatstuff, I'll pull

you apart!

FATSO

You're the kind of character I eat

for breakfast, ya little --

MRS. KIPFER

Now, you gentlemen know I will not

have any of this sort of thing.

44.

MAGGIO

Shut up, you Wop, he says to me!

FATSO

Little Mussolini here tryin to tell

me what way to play the piano.

MAGGIO

Yeah, my ear drums fit to bust

already with that noise!

MRS. KIPFER

You man can simply leave if you're

not going to behave yourselves.

PREW

Come on, Angelo, come on --

MAGGIO

-- Ony my friends can call me Wop --

SOLDIER

(has been watching)

You know who that guy is, buddy?

MAGGIO

Sure, I know who he is. Whadda I

care?

PREW

Who is he?

SOLDIER

Fatso Judson. Sergeant of the Guard

at the Post Stockade.

SOLDIER

-- I'm tellin you, leave him be.

Nets danger. I seen him nearly

murder a guy once. He likes it.

45.

SANDRA

All right, bully boy, now you won

the war, let's dance.

MAGGIO

(beginning to quiet down)

First I got to calm my nerves. Come

on with me to a phone booth or some

thin.

(slaps himself on belly)

Where I will unveil this fifth of

whisky I got under this loose

flowing sports shirt.

BILL

-- you go along as fast as forty

miles per through that surf and

your balance has got to be letter

perfect.

PREW

Hey, I thought you were gonna wait.

LORENE

(looks up, smiles)

Bill here was telling me about

surfboarding.

BILL

Hello, friend.

LORENE

(PATS COUCH)

Sit down and just listen. He

describes it thrillingly.

46.

BILL

You know anything about

surfboarding?

PREW

No. Nothing. Not a thing.

BILL

You must be stationed inland then.

I'm at DeRussey so I get lots of

chances.

PREW

Yeah? But then we got mountains.

You know anything about mountain

climbing?

BILL

A little bit. Are you a mountain

climber?

PREW

No. You know anything about flying

an airplane?

BILL

I've had a few lessons.

PREW

Well, I can't fly either. What

do you know about deep sea diving?

LORENE

Do you want to move into another

room, Bill?

BILL

Sure. The air in here seems to have

gotten very smelly, hasn't it?

PREW

Yeah, I noticed that, too --

BILL

Listen, fellow --

LORENE

Shall we go, then?

47.

KAREN

Why, hello. I didn't think you were

coming.

WARDEN

Why not? I'm not late.

KAREN

No, I guess you're not. But then I

came a little early. I must have

been overanxious. You weren't

overanxious though, were you? You

got here right on the dot.

WARDEN

Maybe I'd of been early too only I

stopped to get a drink.

KAREN

You certainly chose a savory spot

for our meeting.

WARDEN

Would you rather it'd been the

cocktail lounge of the Royal?

KAREN

No, but I've had five chances to be

picked up in the last few minutes.

48.

WARDEN

(sits beside her on the

BENCH)

That's par for the course around

here.

KAREN

Well, I don't care for it. I never

went in much for back-alley loving.

WARDEN

Didn't you?

KAREN

You probably think I'm a tramp,

don't you?

WARDEN

What makes you think I'd think

that?

KAREN

Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant.

If you think this is a mistake,

come right out and say so.

WARDEN

(OUTRAGE)

Listen, what started all this,

anyway? Why'm I shakin inside like

a school kid out with teacher!

Where'd I come up with a yen for of

all things the Compny Commander's

wife! And her actin like Lady

Astor's horse all because I only

got here on time!

KAREN

On the other hand, I've got a

bathing suit under my dress.

WARDEN

Funny. I got one in a U-Drive-It

parked around the corner.

49.

PREW

How's the surfboard rider?

LORENE

That was a terrible way to have

acted. What you did.

PREW

I was jealous.

LORENE

(LAUGHS)

You're a funny one.

PREW

What do you dames want? To take

the heart out of a man and tie it

up in barbed wire?

LORENE

(angry because she really

LIKES PREW)

Now, look here, what do you think

Mrs. Kipfer pays us for? We're

hired to be nice to all the boys.

They're all alike. Is it so

important?

PREW

(STANDS; URGENTLY)

Yes, it's important. Maybe we seem

all alike but none of us is ever

all alike.

(PAUSE)

All right, I'm sorry about before.

LORENE

(touched by his outburst)

That piano is about to drive me out

of my mind. Let's go up to Mrs.

Kipfer's suite and sit there. She

lets us use it sometimes... for

somebody special.

PREW

Are you mad?

50.

LORENE

No, I'm not mad.

PREW

Because if you're still mad I'd

just rather we called the whole

thing off.

LORENE

(takes his arm)

You certainly are a funny one.

DISSOLVE TO:

KAREN

I hope the ocean's ice cold. I hope

I freeze in a solid chunk.

WARDEN

(sudden, intense laugh)

Just so long's you melt afterwards.

KAREN

I love the way you laugh.

51.

LORENE

... I enlisted, too. I came out

here on my own. To get away from my

home town. In Oregon.

PREW

How come?

LORENE

I had a boy friend. I was a

waitress. He was from the richest

family in town. He just married the

girl suitable for his position.

After three years of going around

with me.

(PAUSE)

It's a pretty story, isn't it?

Maybe they could make a movie of

it.

PREW

They did. Ten thousand of them.

ANOTHER ANGLE

LORENE

So I left and went to Seattle, as a

waitress. And I met a girl just

back from Hawaii. She said she'd

made a lot of money working for

Mrs. Kipfer. I caught the first

boat. I've been here a year and two

months.

PREW

You like it much?

52.

LORENE

Oh, I don't like it. But I don't

mind it. Anyway, I won't be here

forever.

PREW

No. Sure not. I mean, why should

you?

LORENE

I have it all figured out. In

another year I'll be back home,

with a pile of bills big enough to

choke a steer. And then I will be

all set for life --

MAGGIO

I dint hear no sounds of combat. So

I figgered maybe you'd like a

drink.

THREE SHOT

MAGGIO

Or otherwise old Sandra would of

drank it all by herself. She's a

fine girl. But she drinks like a

fish.

LORENE

No, thanks. I never drink much.

LORENE

I think it' a a weakness.

MAGGIO

(ANOTHER GULP)

I grant you that.

53.

LORENE

And I don't like weakness.

(TO PREW) )

Do you?

PREW

No. I don't like weakness.

(rises, takes a drink)

But I like to drink.

LORENE

With you it's not a weakness. With

you it's more like a virtue.

MAGGIO

That sounds like a very profound

remark. Maybe that's why I don't

get it.

LORENE

(snuggles to Prew)

Well, it's so.

MAGGIO

Hey! What you gonna do, marry this

guy? Way you grinnin at him you

look like his wife!

PREW

Get outa here!

MAGGIO

(picks up bottle)

Okay. Back to old long-legged

Sandra. I love 'em tall. Acres and

acres.

MAGGIO

Enjoy yourself, pizon. You need it

more than me. You be back with The

Treatment tomorrow.

54.

PREW

That was nice before. The way you

snuggled up. In front of him.

LORENE

What's he mean, The Treatment?

LORENE

What did he mean?

PREW

Some of the guys puttin me over the

jumps because I won't fight.

LORENE

Fight?

PREW

On the boxing team. I don't want to

fight! I don't want to talk about

it! I don't want to think about it.

And they make me think about it.

Every day.

PREW

It's a personal thing...

PREW

Over at Port Shafter... I used to

fight... Middleweight. I was pretty

good. I used to work out with Dixie

Wells. He was a light-heavy, but he

was fast... And good. He loved

boxing. He was gonna come out of

the Army and go right into the

upper brackets... People on the

Outside had their eye on him.

(rises, paces)

Dixie didn't want, to use the six

ounce gloves this time. And we

neither of us wore headgear,

anyway. I was set flat on my feet

when I caught Dixie wide with this

no more than ordinary solid cross.

Dixie just happened to be standing

solid, too.

(MORE)

55.

PREW(CONT'D)

(sits on chair)

From the way he fell I knew. Dead

weight, square on his face. He dint

roll over. He was in a coma a week.

Then he finally came out of it. The

only thing was that he was blind...

(rises, paces)

I went up to the hospital to see

him. Twice. Then I couldn't go

back. We got to talking about

fighting the second time. And Dixie

cried... Seein tears comin out of

those eyes that couldn't see...

CLOSEUP

EXTREME CLOSEUP

KAREN

Nobody ever kissed me that way...

not really...

WARDEN

Nobody?

56.

KAREN

No. Nobody.

WARDEN

Not even one? Out of all the many

men you've been kissed by?

KAREN

Well, that will take some figuring.

How many men do you think there've

been?

WARDEN

I wouldn't know. Can't you even

make me a rough estimate?

KAREN

Not without an adding machine. Do

you have your adding machine with

you?

WARDEN

No, I forgot to bring it.

KAREN

Then I guess you won't find out,

will you?

WARDEN

Maybe I already know.

KAREN

What's the matter? What are you

hinting at?

WARDEN

Why? Is there something to hint at?

KAREN

I don't know. Maybe a lot. Or maybe

you just think there's a lot.

WARDEN

Maybe I do. Maybe there's been a

long line of beach parties --

57.

KAREN

You must be crazy -- !

WARDEN

Am I? Listen, baby, maybe not here.

But what about when you and Holmes

were at Fort Bliss?

KAREN

I had to go and forget you were a

man -- with the same rotten filthy

mind the rest of them have. For a

minute I had to convince myself you

were different --

WARDEN

Only it's true, ain't it?

KAREN

Yes, it's true! A part of it, some

small part of whatever sewage

you've been listening to. Some day

perhaps you'll get all the story.

WARDEN

(YAPS UP)

All what story?

KAREN

You're getting to sound so much

like a typical male. So you just

sweat it out like a typical male.

KAREN

All right. I've never told it to

anyone before. But I think now is

the time. I'll tell you the whole

bloody messy thing. You can take it

back to the barracks with you.

58.

KAREN

I'd been married to Captain Dana E.

Holmes two years. Only he was a

First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort

Bliss. We lived right on a little

lake where we could fish and swim

and be alone, our 'dream

cottage'... I'm sure you must be

able to picture it. It was off on a

back road, four miles from the

highway. Two miles from a neighbor

and a telephone....

(pauses, then rushes on)

I hadn't been married long when

I knew my husband was stepping

out on me. But -- you get used

to that. Your mother tells you

that it's life, that i t happens

to a lot of women. Of course,

she doesn't tell you until after

it happens.

KAREN

Then, by that time, you're

pregnant. And at least you've

something else to hope for. I think

I was almost happy that night the

pains began. Even though they were

weeks too early, a whole month too

early. I remember Dana was putting

on that dapper silk gabardine

uniform he used to wear. He was

going to an officer's 'seminar.' He

was kidding me about false labor. I

didn't think it was humorous. I

told him to get home early, to

bring the doctor with him. He

smiled tenderly and told me about

the psychic reactions of women to

pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be

back early. And maybe he would

have... if the 'seminar' hadn't

been with the hat-check girl in one

of the night clubs.

59.

WARDEN

Listen.

TWO SHOT

KAREN

He was only a little drunk when he

came in... at five a.m. He looked

alarmed when he saw me. I guess it

was because of my screams. I was

lying there on the floor, you see --

No, don't say anything. I'm not

finished yet. Of course, the baby

was dead. It was a boy. But they

worked over me at the hospital and

fixed me up fine. They even took my

appendix out, too. They threw that

in free. It was all fine.

WARDEN

Listen. Listen. Please.

KAREN

And, of course, one more thing no

more children. Do you know what

that means? You're not a woman.

You're not anything. You're a

gutted shell... Sure, I went out

with some of the men after that. A

few months of it. I'd been made

dirty and I wanted to be clean. You

can see that, can't you?... Anyway,

I got my revenge on Dana. I kept on

living with him.

WARDEN

The hateful, miserable --

KAREN

You hunt so hungrily for love...

love, if you can find it, you

think, might give things meaning

again.

WARDEN

Listens Listen to me --

KAREN

All right. I'm listening.

60.

KAREN

I know. Until I met you I didn't

think it was possible, either.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

TREADWELL

... Ah'm in the Army because Ah can

live better on the Inside than on

the Outside.

PREW

It ain't the reason I'm in.

MAGGIO

Now he's gonna give us that snow

about bein a Thirty-Year Man again.

PREW

That's right. Look at Karelsen

there. Only seven years more for

rockin chair money.

61.

KARELSEN

The Profession wears you down,

though, young man. Down thin like a

knife what's been honed and honed.

All that good steel just rubbed

away...

TREADWELL

Man, that's blues! Where'd you drag

that one up Prom?

ANDERSON

(BASHFULLY)

Oh, just stumbled on it.

PREW

They got Truckdrivers' Blues...

Sharecroppers' Blues...

Bricklayers' Blues... We oughta

have a Soljers' Blues...

CLARK

Hey, look... I betcha we could make

one out of what you just played. Do

that again.

ANDERSON

I could bring it down to a third

line major ending... Regular twelve

bars blues.

TREADWELL

I bet I got two hundred blues

records back home.

62.

TREADWELL(CONT'D)

But there ain't one could touch

that. And that includes Saint

Louis. And it could be ours...

PREW

PREW

guy getting discharged.

Hey, fella, can I use this?

GALOVITCH

HOLMES

What's the matter with you,

Prewitt? You know better than to

officer.

PREW

Yes, sir. But I have never liked

being spit at, sir. Even by a non-

commissioned officer.

HOLMES

I think you owe Sergeant Galovitch

an apology.

PREW

(RECKLESSLY)

I don't think I owe him no apology.

In fact, I think one's owed to me.

HOLMES

(FURIOUS)

Sergeant Galovitch, take this man

to the barracks and have him roll a

full field pack, extra shoes,

helmet and all, and then take a

can't be decent to a man like that.

You have to tame him, like an

(TO WARDEN)

Warden, I want you to prepare court

martial papers. Insubordination and

insolence to an officer.

WARDEN

Yes, sir.

WARDEN

Too bad you got to lose a

middleweight like that...

HOLMES

Why? Do you see any other way of

breaking him?

67.

WARDEN

I don't know... But even if he only

gets three months, he'll still be

in the Stockade when the boxing

finals come up.

WARDEN

How about just giving him a good

stiff Compny punishment for now?

HOLMES

All right, all right. But throw the

book at him.

WARDEN

Yes, sir.

The Canal Zone for me. This girl

high class dinner and then dancing.

It was a great shock to her to

learn about life. But she took it

well. She got to like me very much

after that.

WARDEN

The last time I heard it you told

KARELSEN

Well, what did you expect? I was in

There is a way. I've been thinking

KAREN

You've got to become an officer.

WARDEN

What!

KAREN

You're eligible for the extension

course that came in with the draft.

When you get your commission they'd

ship you back to the States -- new

officers aren't kept at posts where

they've been enlisted men. Then --

WARDEN

You sure made a thorough study of

it.

KAREN

Then I could divorce Dana and

follow you and marry you.

WARDEN

An officer! I've always hated

officers.

KAREN

That's a fine, intelligent point

of view. Suppose I said I've always

hated Sergeants. That would make a

lot of sense, wouldn't it?

WARDEN

Okay, suppose I did it. -- And

don't think it's a cinch -- the

exams are tough. Then you'd be

six months! We'll probly be in the

war by then --

You want to go back to the States

could swing a Sergeant's stripes --

If I were a non-com the Army'd let

me pick my duty when I re-enlist.

(lost in the picture of

And there's some posts back in the

States -- like Jefferson Barracks --

The married noncoms rate solid

brick houses... with lawns with new-

cut grass and walks with big old

oak trees...

COLONEL WILLIAMS

--- In addition to inefficiency

in administering his command and

neglect of duty, Captain Holmes has

been guilty of indefensible cruelty

to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.

This extended to instigating and

encouraging wholly unauthorized and

discreditable tactics to force the

soldier to join the inter-regiment

boxing team. These findings are the

result of personal investigation by

the Inspector General and are

corroborated by numerous members of

G Company.

GENERAL SLATER

I'm waiting for your reply to this.

HOLMES

I haven't any, sir... The charges --

are true.

GENERAL SLATER

Holmes, the first thing I ever

learned in the Army was that an

officer takes care of his men. It

seems to be the first thing you

forgot. It's monstrous to think of

anybody like you in command of

troops. And believe me, you won't

be for long. My only regret is that

we have to keep you in uniform

until a court martial is concluded.

(MORE)

130.

GENERAL SLATER(cont'd)

In the meantime, of course, I'm

relieving you of your present

duties.

HOLMES

If there were any way to avoid a

court martial, sir. Any way...

COLONEL WILLIAMS

There is one alternative,

General... if you're so disposed. A

resignation for the good of the

service under AR 600-275.

GENERAL SLATER

(thinks a moment)

I'll give you a chance you don't

deserve, Holmes. Write a letter of

resignation and have it on my desk

this afternoon. I'll consider

accepting it. Only because as far

as I'm concerned, the quicker

you're out of the Army the better

for everybody. Especially the Army.

DISSOLVE TO:

HOLMES

--- that's right, it's a letter of

resignations I'm through! I've

already been relieved! So you can

HOLMES

Where has it gone, Karen? What

happened to it? The gay, cheerful

life we were going to have, you and

I...? What happened to me...? The

proud, dashing officer was going to

be. The leader of men?... I've

known all along how the men felt

about me. They despised me...

What's happened? I don't remember

losing anything... Where has it all

gone?

the first day he came in. He said a

man has got to go his own way... if

he don't, he's nothin... I'm an

Enlisted Man. I'm a First Sergeant.

Milt Warden. Once I cross that line
