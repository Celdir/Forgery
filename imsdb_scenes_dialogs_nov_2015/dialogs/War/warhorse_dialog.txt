WAR HORSE

FARMER

Come on, easy, girl. Easy, girl.

Easy.

FARMER 2

This is a stubborn one, huh?

FARMER 3

There we go. Who's a clever girl?

2.

FARMER 2

Easy does it. Easy does it. Come on,

steady does it.

AUCTION MAN 1

Mornin', pop. Put your mark here.

Good luck.

3.

AUCTION MAN 2

Get the colt...

AUCTION MAN 3

Whoa! Whoa!

AUCTION MAN 3 (CONT'D)

Easy...

DAD

Now that's a beauty.

SI EASTON

Forget it, Ted. He's half

thoroughbred and not got a day's

work in him.

(points to a plow horse next to

JOEY)

Now, there... There's your ticket.

DAD

But look at him, Si. Look at that creature.

4.

SI EASTON

Don't be daft. You need something

solid to plow a field.

DAD

(fixed on Joey)

Yeah, but he's something else, that one.

AUCTIONEER

Alright gentlemen - settle down - settle

down - horses on my right - men with money

in their pockets on my left - it's the

perfect combination. Is Fred Goddard here?

FRED

YES! I's here.

AUCTIONEER

Good - more money than sense. Dave Hill?

DAVE

I'm here. Yes!

AUCTIONEER

Bugger off, you tight bastard - you've been

coming here for 20 years - never bought so

much as a pork scratching.

AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)

Okay - first up today - a gorgeous young

horse - prettiest thing I've seen since my

wife on our wedding day. Let's get going,

shall we? Who wants this wonderful creature.

DAD

One guinea.

5.

AUCTIONEER

One guinea, one guinea, one

guinea...

YOUNG ANDREW EASTON

I thought you needed a plow horse, Mister

Narracott.

AUCTIONEER

Any advance on one guinea? Any

advance on one guinea?

LYONS

Two guineas.

DAD

Three!

SI EASTON

Ted Narracott - it's completely the wrong

animal.

DAD

Si Easton - I'm not gonna let that

bastard see me off.

LYONS

Five guineas.

DAD

Six!

SI EASTON

Oh for the love of...!

LYONS

Seven.

DAD

Greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody.

(BIDDING)

Eight.

6.

SI EASTON

Stop it - he's your landlord - you

can't be picking fights with him.

LYONS

Ten guineas.

SI EASTON

You haven't got the money. Let's go

home - let's have a pint.

DAD

Eleven guineas, sir, from as good a man as

any in this town.

AUCTIONEER

Do I hear twelve guineas? Twelve guineas?

SI EASTON

That's top price for a workin'

animal. Ted! Save it for the shire!

DAD

There are big days and there are

small days. Which will it be?

AUCTIONEER

Do I hear any advance on eleven guineas?

DAVID LYONS

Just let him go, dad, I don't care

for him, he's too... jumpy.

LYONS

Shall we say - twenty five?

SI EASTON

Well, he's got you there. Nice try, Ted.

7.

ANDREW

You were great, Mr N. Gave him a run

for his money.

AUCTIONEER

Going, going...

DAD

Thirty. Thirty guineas!

AUCTIONEER

Thirty guineas. Thirty guineas. Going

going gone - to Mister Ted Narracott.

SI EASTON

What have you done, Ted? What have you done?

LYONS

Quite a beast, there. But what you gonna do

with him - on a working farm? I hope you

got the rent, Ted. I'll be around for it

when it comes due.

SI EASTON

You're a fool, Ted. And our Rosie'll

never forgive you.

8.

MRS. NARRACOTT

What have you done?

ALBERT

That's Mooney's colt!

MRS. NARRACOTT

You were supposed to buy a plow horse.

ALBERT

You bought him?

MRS. NARRACOTT

What'd you pay for him?

MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)

How much, Ted Narracott?

DAD

I won't tell you a lie - though I would love

to. Thirty guineas.

MRS. NARRACOTT

Thirty guineas!

MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)

He's not worth ten! Are you out of your

mind? What about the rent?

DAD

He's a strong one, Rosie. Look at

the way he holds his head!

MRS. NARRACOTT

How the hell are we gonna pull anything with

that? Ted - you have to take him back. You

have to take him back right now now.

ALBERT

No.

9.

MRS. NARRACOTT

You have to get down on your knees and beg

for our money back.

ALBERT

No. No, please don't take him back.

DAD

We can't take him back till he's broken in.

MRS. NARRACOTT

And how are you gonna train a horse with

that leg?

ALBERT

I'll train him.

MRS. NARRACOTT

No, you stay out of this, Albie. You don't

know nothing about horses.

ALBERT

Please, Mum. Please let me. I can do it.

DAD

We have to keep him. We've no choice.

MRS. NARRACOTT

Right. Well... you've got one month to

break him in or I'm taking him back myself.

(She turns to the house,

but then...)

How did you get to thirty - what other fool

bid you up that high?

DAD

It was Lyons.

MRS. NARRACOTT

We're gonna lose everything. After all we've

been through - we're gonna lose it all.

10.

ALBIE

Don't worry, Mum - I'll raise him - and I'll

raise him good.

MRS. NARRACOTT

Well, you better. Go on - get started. See

if a child can undo what your fool of a

father's done to this family of ours.

ALBERT

Right. Let's make a start then.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

It's oats. Very tasty, that is. It's

beef and gravy to us!

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Come on...

ALBERT (CONT'D)

I bet you're missing your mother.

Look at you... first time without

your mum. First time away from home.

But you're not alone, are you. In

fact. Cos I'm `ere...

ALBERT (CONT'D)

It's alright. It's alright.

11.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

I'm gonna call you Joey. Understand? Joey.

That's you. And I'm Albert. It's alright,

You're mine now. You're mine.

ALBERT

Whoa. I want you to stay there,

Joey. Stay. That's it. Good boy.

That's it, you've got it.

ANDREW

Hey, look at him, Albie. He's

playing "Grandma's Footsteps."

ALBERT

Right, come on, Joey. Back you go.

Come on. Back you go.

(MORE)

12.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

You're all right. That's it. Good

boy. Right. You've gotta stay

there, understand?

ALBERT (CONT'D)

That's it. Good boy. You've got it.

Good boy.

ANDREW

Good boy. Good.

(TO ALBERT)

Now call him. Whistle.

ALBERT

Come now, Joey. Come on.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

You can come now, Joey.

ANDREW

Don't think he fancies your owls.

ALBERT

No, I read it in a story. It's how

the Indians used to summon their

horses.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Now, Joey, when I whistle, you've

gotta come, understand?

ANDREW

My dad had a dog who stayed when you

called him. He used to run up

behind you when you weren't

looking, and uh...

ALBERT

He's not a dog. He's just puzzling

it through.

13.

ANDREW

Brilliant. Look at you.

MRS. NARRACOTT

Albie.

LYONS

There's only fifteen here.

DAD

The rest will come.

LYONS

You know by rights I could take this farm

back today, don't you? And I'm a great

believer in my rights.

DAD

It will come.

LYONS

If you drank less beer and bought fewer

horses you might be able to look your

landlord in the eye, Narracott.

14.

DAD

I said I'll pay you. We got to plant the

bottom field.

LYONS

Bottom field's rock hard. Only stones down

there.

DAD

No, we're going to plow it. Just give me

`til the autumn. I'll pay every penny I owe

you. With interest.

LYONS

How you going to plow it? Not with that

fancy animal of yours?

DAD

He'll do it.

LYONS

You'll not get that one in a harness, let

alone pulling a plow. Even drunk on a

Tuesday night, you know that. And I can't

wait for the money - there's a war coming.

DAD

I promise you that field will be plowed.

We'll plant it with turnips. And the money

will be yours when harvest comes.

MRS. NARRACOTT

Please, sir. Please.

LYONS

Very well - if that fancy plows that field

I'll give you till October to set things

straight.

ALBERT

What if he doesn't?

LYONS

I'll take the horse on the day he fails.

(BEAT)

(MORE)

15.

LYONS (CONT'D)

And I'll take your father's farm and give it

to working men who can hold their pints and

hold their heads high in decent company.

ALBERT

No, please. Sir, you can't do that.

LYONS

Now, now, now, lad. What - are you bladdered

as well?! Ted Narracott - I got you down in

my book!

ALBERT

You can't harness him.

DAD

He's got to be collared.

ALBERT

No, you can't. Look, you're scaring him,

Dad. You're scaring him. He...

(DESPERATE)

He can't take a plow!

DAD

He's got to plow!

16.

ALBERT

He won't be able to do it - he's too young -

he's not even been backed yet....

MRS. NARRACOTT

Ted!

ALBERT

It's alright, boy. It's alright. It's

alright. It's alright.

MRS. NARRACOTT

I knew this would happen soon as I laid eyes

on him....

MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)

Ted. No. Ted, no!

DAD

He's worth nothing to me! If he won't take

the collar, he's not worth a damn thing!

ALBERT

Dad?

DAD

Move aside.

ALBERT

Dad. Stop.

MRS. NARRACOTT

You shoot that horse we have nothing.

17.

MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)

NO!

ALBERT

You were right what you said, Dad. "He'll do

it," you told Lyons, "He'll plow that

field." And he will! You'll see. He'll show

you. We'll show you. We'll get it done.

MUM

Let go. Let go.

MUM (CONT'D)

Go back to the house.

MRS. NARRACOTT

Here, here. Some days are best forgotten.

Today ain't one of them. Come on.

ALBERT

How are you today, Joey? I don't know much

about life, boy, but I do know that there

are big days and there are small days. And

most days are small days, and, well, they

don't matter much to anyone - but this -

well, this is a big one. This is our big

day. Well, it's cold out there. So I'm going

to take this off -

(he takes off his coat)

Well, if it's tough for you - it should be

tough for me, too...

18.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Now, I'm gonna teach you how to plow

and you're gonna learn. Is that

understood? And then we can be

together, which is how I believe

things are meant to be.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Boy. Steady, boy. Here we go. Here

we go.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Easy, easy... Look at me, Joey. See?

See? You've just gotta put your nose

through.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

That's it. See? You've got it.

You've got it. Good boy. There...

SI EASTON

Too large, too rocky, matted with

grass roots. Even a sturdy plow

horse'd never manage it alone.

19.

ANDREW

Yet he will, I say.

SI EASTON

You'd swear he'd sprout wings and

fly if Albert had told you so.

(smiling at his son:)

It's a fine thing, loyal to your

mate. Even if he is a bit barmy. A

team of two might manage, given a

month and good weather.

LYONS

Ted too squeamish to watch, is he?

SI EASTON

`Course he's watching.

LYONS

Well, you've raised him up a true

Narracott, Ted, picture of his

father, he is: not a dollop of

ordinary sense but that thick

stubbornness that'll lead him to

insist on the impossible.

LYONS (CONT'D)

Wasn't a farmer in Devon didn't

admire you, myself among `em,

leaving your brothers that fine farm

and setting yourself at this stoney

patch of unpromising ground. You've

fettle enough for twenty men, but

with a gimpy leg and the drinking -

for the pain, isn't it, that you

drink?

(MORE)

20.

LYONS (CONT'D)

- yeah, none of us could have

anticipated an ending better than

this. Makes me question the wisdom

of the charity that urged me to rent

you this place, not only looking at

you, me old pal, but that pretty

little wife of yours, thought you

were a spark, she did.

LYONS CONCLUDES:

LYONS (CONT'D)

And now your son's sinking into the

selfsame bog that's swallowing you.

ALBERT

See Joey - I got the collar, too!

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Come on, boy. Walk on. That's it. Walk on!

Walk on, Joey. Come on, boy, walk on.

LYONS

You'd be better off startin' at the

top of the hill and goin' down!

Gravity's the only friend you're

gonna have today, young lad.

ALBERT

Walk on, Joey! Walk on! Come on,

Joey, walk on. Walk on, boy.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Walk on. Come on, walk on.

TED

(TO HIMSELF:)

It'll take the whip to move him.

21.

LYONS

Bravo! You've reached the top of the

hill! Off you go again, boy! You'll

make even better time comin' down!!

ALBERT

Good boy. Good lad. Good lad. Now

walk on. Good boy.

ANDREW

Albie, we're all with ya!

LYONS

Look look look! The plow hasn't even cut

yet!

22.

ALBERT

Do you know - I believe we can do

it, Joey. I knew when I first saw

you that you'd be the best of us.

That's why he bought you. He knows

you've all the courage he never had.

I knew when I first saw you that

you'd be the one who'd save us.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Whoa. Whoa.

LYONS

You've got no chance, lad. He'll not

turn over half an acre. Give it up

now. You've done well. You've tried

hard. You're more of a man than your

father.

SI EASTON

Come on now, Mr. Lyons, that's a bit

rough, isn't it?

LYONS

(A SHRUG:)

Well, he'll destroy that horse.

LYONS (CONT'D)

I'll be over Thursday. Give you a

day to close it up.

23.

NEIGHBOUR

Your wool.

(THEN)

I'm sorry, Rosie.

ALBERT

Now, boy! You've got to do it, Joey.

You don't know, so I'm gonna have to

do the knowing for you when the rest

of our lives depend on this! So get

set to pull - and pull straight! And

pull hard!

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Now, boy! Go!

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Walk on, Joey! Walk on! That's it!

Good boy, Joey! Good boy!

ANDREW

Walk on! Walk on! Walk on! Walk

on, Joey!

ANDREW (CONT'D)

(YELLING)

Go around it!!

ALBERT

Whoa, Joey! Whoa, Joey! Joey! Joey,

whoa whoa whoa! Joey, stop! You'll

break the blade -

24.

ANDREW

Will you look at you?

SAYS:

LYONS

I'd not let a child of mine slip in

the mud alongside a plow blade. He

could lose a foot!

ROSIE NARRACOTT

You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr.

Lyons, if you carry on prating at me

how to manage my son! Or my plow, or

my horse, or my field, or my farm!

MRS. NARRACOTT

Come on, Albie! Push on through!

ANDREW

Get it done, Albie! Get it done!

25.

ROSIE

Oh, my pair of fools. My mighty

fools.

ROSIE

You're as battered and bloodied as he is.

ALBERT

And where's Dad?

ROSIE

Still in the bottom field.

ALBERT

Stumbling about, I suppose.

ROSIE

It's not the drink, Albert, that

makes him stumble -

26.

ALBERT

(ABRUPTLY)

He drinks, mum.

ROSIE

Well, so might you if you'd been

where he's been, seen what he's

seen!

ALBERT

Well, he don't talk to me about it.

ROSIE

He don't talk about it because he

can't. There aren't words for some

things. Come here...

ROSIE (CONT'D)

The mice've been at it. Sit down.

MRS. NARRACOTT

Here. It's his campaign pennant. He were

Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial

Yeomanry.

ROSIE

And that is the Queen's South Africa

Medal. Every man who fought in the

Boer War got one of those. But

this...

ROSIE (CONT'D)

That's the Distinguished Conduct

Medal.

27.

ALBERT

Not dad's?

ROSIE

Well it ain't mine, dear. He got

that after the fighting at

Transvaal. After he'd been hurt, and

he'd saved some other lads, and

well... I don't know what else, he

won't tell me either. But the first

day he got home he just... tossed

them out. First day he could walk,

he threw `em straight in the

dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word I

said not to.

ROSIE (CONT'D)

See, what you done today, you and

Joey, you're chuffed up now, and so

you should be, my splendid boy. It's

good to be proud when you done

something good. But what he done, in

Africa, whatever it was, he takes no

pride in it. Hard as it surely was,

and however much pain it's cost him,

he refuses to be proud of killing, I

suppose.

ALBERT

(CONFUSED:)

I'd be proud. If I'd gone off to

war. If I'd gone and saved my

mates, and -

ROSIE

Well, whether or not you think you'd

do the same thing as him... Think

how brave he is for refusing to be

proud.

28.

ROSIE (CONT'D)

Oh, your dad makes mistakes. And he

drinks to forget the mistakes that

he's made - but he never gave up and

he does that for us. And today, you

showed the world it's all been worth

it.

ROSIE (CONT'D)

You keep looking after Joey and

he'll always be looking after you.

ALBERT

(SOFTLY:)

Sergeant, Seventh Battalion,

Imperial Yeomanry.

(amazed, to Joey:)

You see this, Joey? It's been

through an entire war.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

I'm not stealing it. I'll give it

back to him, someday.

29.

DAVID

Um, I'm the only boy that drives in

the village. No one else drives but

me.

YOUNG WOMAN

Oh, yeah?

DAVID

That's right and this is my dad's

car. You're lucky that you're in

it. I'm not normally allowed to

drive it `cause it's so -

YOUNG WOMAN

Is he a friend of yours?

ALBERT

Come on, boy, let's show her how to

fly!

30.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Well...you're clearly not gonna be a

jumper.

MRS. NARRACOTT

Shoo, Harold. Shoo, shoo, shoo!

ALBERT

We can try planting something else, or we

could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

How else we gonna pay Mr. Lyons'

rent?

31.

MRS. NARRACOTT

What we gonna do?

DAD

I used to believe that God gave each man his

fair portion of bad luck. I don't feel that

any more. I've had more than my share.

(PAUSE)

You'll stop loving me, Rose. And I won't

blame you when you do.

ROSE

Well, I might hate you more - but I'll never

love you less.

MOTORBIKE RIDER

It's war!

MOTORBIKE RIDER (CONT'D)

We are at War with Germany. You hear?

England is at war with Germany.

MOTORBIKE RIDER (CONT'D)

They're going to ring the bells at six

o'clock - and then never ring them again

until the war is over.

32.

ALBERT

Look smart, Joey lad, it's the Tavistock

Fair!

ALBERT

What has he done with him?

RECRUITING OFFICER

Last name first. First name, middle

name, last.

33.

DAD

Take my word for it - finest horse

in the parish. Goes like a racer,

strong, decent, very fine.

SAM PERKINS

No curbs, no splints, good feet and

teeth. He's as sound as a bell,

sir.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

And how much are you charging, sir - for

this strong, decent, and very fine animal?!

DAD

Forty.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

I'll give you twenty and not a penny more.

DAD

Twenty is no good to me, Captain. Thirty

five and he's yours.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

I don't even know how he rides.

DAD

Oh, he rides... Splendidly. You'll

be astonished. I promise you that.

(his heart's in his

throat, fighting back

GRIEF)

Finest horse in all of Devon. Finest

horse I ever seen.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Thank you.

ALBERT

You can't! You can't, he's mine! I trained

him!

34.

DAD

Albert.

ALBERT

You can't have him. He's my horse, sir.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

I'm afraid it's too late, lad. I've just

paid thirty guineas for him.

ALBERT

(TO TED:)

Please, I'll get you money. I will,

I'll get you money. I'll...I'll work

for it! I'll work for it.

(TO NICHOLLS:)

He won't obey anyone else. He won't

be any good in the war, neither.

He...he shies at every sound!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

I'm sorry.

ALBERT

Well, if Joey's going, I'm going,

too. I'm volunteering.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

I see. What's your name, lad?

ALBERT

Albert, sir.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

And how old are you, Albert?

ALBERT

Nineteen, sir.

CAPTAIN NICHOLS

Is that the truth?

ALBERT

No sir. But, but I look nineteen and

I'm bigger than most nineteen-year-

olds, sir! And I'm strong, sir! And

I...I'm not afraid of anything.

NICHOLLS INTERJECTS:

35.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

I don't doubt your qualifications,

Albert, but the law is very clear

about the proper age for soldiering,

and your father's done what he had

to do. You know that. Thirty guineas

isn't nearly enough to purchase a

horse as fine as your Joey, I know

that. But it's all I've got. Will

you lease him to me, Albert, to be

my own mount?

(he removes his cap,

EARNEST)

I promise you, man to man, that I'll

look after him as closely as you've

done, I'll respect him and all the

care that you've taken with him. And

if I can - I'll return him to your

care.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)

Now say goodbye.

ALBERT

It's all right, boy...

SAM PERKINS

All right, turn it in, eh? That's enough.

He's a horse, not a dog. Now, on your way.

(TO JOEY)

Come on.

DAD

Do you want to lose the farm, Rose?

ROSIE

It's the way you did it.

DAD

But we're at war.

36.

ROSIE

Aren't we just.

ALBERT

Joey...

SAM PERKINS

Here now, I've told you - sling your

hook!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Let him be, Perkins.

ALBERT

This isn't the end. This isn't the

end, my brother... I, Albert

Narracott, solemnly swear we will be

together again. Wherever you are, I

will find you. And I will bring you

home!

37.

SAM PERKINS

Whoa. Steady, steady. Steady now,

come on. Walk on! Walk on now,

come on!

GROOM

Whoa whoa whoa. Easy easy...

SAM PERKINS

Whoa whoa whoa, Joey! Stop muckin'

about, you hear? Yer in the army

now, son.

SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)

Good boy, good boy. Steady

steady... Easy. Relax. Easy easy,

back up.

SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)

Joey - meet Topthorn. Topthorn - this is

Joey. Sort out who's in charge between the

two of you, you hear? If you want to fight,

you get it over with - `cause once we're

over there, you're gonna need everything

you've got for Fritz!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Gently, Perkins. I don't want to sour him.

38.

SAM PERKINS

There'll be nothing gentle about the war,

sir. And there'll be nothing gentle about

this one either!

SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)

I understand that, Sergeant, but I

want him fit and shining. He's my

horse.

SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)

Sir.

CHARLIE WAVERLY

Scares the living daylights out of me.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Who?

CHARLIE WAVERLY

Perkins. Glad he's on our side.

MAJOR STEWART

Not bad. Not bad at all. Still not

a patch on my Topthorn.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

I wouldn't be so sure. I think he's got

potential. He's certainly got the bit

between his teeth.

CHARLIE WAVERLY

I actually think my Blenheim is faster than

the pair of them.

MAJOR STEWART

Clear off!

39.

MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D)

All right, gentlemen, listen here.

Everything tells us the same story, from

Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett's Charge

to the Battle of Mars La Tours - the first

attack can and should be the decisive one.

Perkins...

SAM PERKINS

Yes, sir!

MAJOR STEWART

No excuses, no mistakes - every

horse groomed and fit for

presentation! I want a full practice

charge tomorrow.

SAM PERKINS

Sir.

MAJOR STEWART

Thought you two had bottled out.

CHARLIE WAVERLY

As if.

MAJOR STEWART

All right, then, let's see what you

two jokers are made of, shall we?

40.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

This is what quiet confidence looks like.

CHARLIE WAVERLY

I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.

MAJOR STEWART

Over to you, Captain Nicholls.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Draw...swords!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)

Give...point!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)

Charge!!!!

41.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)

Come on, Joey. I know you've got

it. Come on, boy! Come on!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)

Come on, boy!

MAJOR STEWART

Whoa. Whoa.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Nice of you to turn up.

MAJOR STEWART

He's got speed...I'll give him that. But

has he got stamina?

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

He has everything.

42.

MAJOR STEWART

What are you up to?

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

I'm writing a letter.

MAJOR STEWART

With a picture in it?

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

It's to the boy who owned Joey. I want to

show him how wonderful he's looking.

MAJOR STEWART

Before we take him away across the Channel

to face a million Germans guns.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Yes. Before that...

MAJOR STEWART

4 a.m. start tomorrow - travelling with the

Dragoon Guards and the Royals. Transport

detachment - they'll need to be at the docks

at 5 am. Check all kit. Battle orders: no

polishing - buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup

irons - let `em all go dull. I want nothing

to flash in the sun and give us away.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Of course.

MAJOR STEWART

Charlie...

CHARLIE WAVERLY

Jamie.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Charlie.

43.

CHARLIE WAVERLY

What do you think of the cap?

CHARLIE WAVERLY (CONT'D)

Silk lining. I quite like it.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

I'm not sure it's going to make a lot of

difference to the Germans.

CHARLIE WAVERLY

Oh, I don't know about that. Think about it -

you're a Boche, just working out which of

two chaps to shoot - and you thought - "Good

Lord - one of them really is wearing a very

stylish cap indeed!" You might shoot the

other one instead.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Or, alternatively, think - "I fancy that

cap" and kill you first of all.

CHARLIE WAVERLY

Hadn't thought of that.

44.

SGT. MAJOR SINGH

That is our target - the German 11th

Division - at the moment bivouacked three

miles to the east of the Menin Road. We have

been watching them and they have pitched

tents for the night and lit cooking fires.

Knock them out - and we could slide in

behind the German lines and come at them

from the South at Geluveld.

MAJOR STEWART

Excellent.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Numbers?

SGT. MAJOR SINGH

About six hundred. Infantry.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Twice our size...

MAJOR STEWART

In regiments of horse and men, the

advantage is ours.

SGT. MAJOR SINGH

And we have surprise on our side.

But the sooner we move, the better -

we have no assurance they'll still

be there tomorrow morning.

MAJOR STEWART

Right. Good. So - today it is.

Charlie - tell the men.

CHARLIE WAVERLY

Salisbury formation?

45.

MAJOR STEWART

Salisbury formation. We'll charge

through them and secure the ground

behind.

SGT. MAJOR SINGH

The grass to the left is taller than

we are - it's perfect cover.

MAJOR STEWART

Excellent work, Sergeant Major.

Time spent on reconnaissance is

rarely wasted.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Thank you, Singh.

(CALLING AFTER)

Jamie!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)

They have no idea we're coming.

MAJOR STEWART

Not having scruples, are you, Jim?

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

No. I understand the surprise is

everything. But if it must be done,

let's do it quickly.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)

Are you alright, Charlie?

CHARLIE WAVERLY

Never been better. Literally, never

better.

MAJOR STEWART

Prepare to mount! Mount!

46.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Thank you, Standley.

(TO JOEY)

Hey, Joey. My bonny boy. You're

all right, aren't you, Joey? Hey?

MAJOR STEWART

Gentleman. It is an honour to ride

beside you. Make the Kaiser rue the

day he dared to cross swords with

us. Let every man make himself, his

King, his country, and his fallen

comrades proud! Be brave. Fear

God. Honor the King!

TROOPERS

(in unison shout)

Fear God. Honor the King!

MAJOR STEWART

Draw swords!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

Good luck, my friends.

MAJOR STEWART

Forward, to walk! Walk...march!

47.

MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D)

Forward to canter! Canter...march!

GERMAN SOLDIER

Kavallerie!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS

CHARGE!

CAMP --

48.

GERMAN OFFICER

(OUTRAGED)

What? Did you think that a garrison

on open ground would go undefended?

Look at yourself! Who do you think

you are?!!

49.

JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER.

What do we do with the horses?

GERMAN OFFICER

If they're injured, shoot them.

JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER

And the others, sir?

GERMAN OFFICER

The others you round up and take to

base camp - they will pull guns.

THIRD OFFICER

You'll never get fancy horses like

these to pull guns.

GERMAN OFFICER

Then shoot them also.

GUNTHER

Sir - perhaps we could use some of

them with the ambulances - to get

the injured men off the field.

GERMAN OFFICER

Will they take the harness?

GUNTHER

I'd like to try, sir.

50.

MICHAEL

It won't work - they're cavalry

GUNTHER

Let's try.

MICHAEL

You won't get the harness on.

GUNTHER

Come on, Michael.

GUNTHER (CONT'D)

Whoa, whoa. Easy, now, easy now,

Englishman... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Easy now, easy.

MICHAEL

Gunther! It's hopeless - we can't

help them.

GUNTHER

Well, well, look at you. Whoever

taught you this has just saved your

life.

51.

SI EASTON

Hello the farm!

ROSIE

(looking up, wiping her

BROW)

Hello, Si Easton!

SI EASTON

I was at the post office and while I

was there, Mrs. Allen said a parcel

had come for Albert, from the, from

the, from over there - and I thought

I could go up that way in the

morning. And - here it is.

ALBERT

Well, who'd be sending me a parcel

over there?

DAD

Well, open it and see.

ALBERT

It's a sketchbook...

(gasp of realization)

That's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook!

See that? That's a picture of Joey!

ROSIE

It's a picture of Joey. Well, I

never!

ALBERT

(EXCITED)

And there's a letter...

ROSIE

Well, go on then, go on.

ALBERT

All right.

(READING)

"Dear Albert Narracott.

(MORE)

52.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Captain Nicholls, who died...Captain

Nicholls, who died in action today

left you this. Yours, Sergeant Sam

Perkins.

ROSIE

You weren't to know it was bad news.

ALBERT

He was riding Joey when he died.

ROSIE

You don't know that he was riding

him...

ALBERT

"In action," it says.

BASE CAMP OFFICER.

Gentlemen! We move forward to the

frontline tonight. Full marching

orders. Get moving!

BASE CAMP OFFICER

Schroeder! Schroeder!

BASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D)

No, not you - you. Come.

53.

BASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D)

I'm keeping you here. You are best

with the horses and we need to move

the camp quickly if the enemy

continue to push through from the

west.

GUNTHER

They're pushing through?

BASE CAMP OFFICER

I'm told. We will move later when we

find where the horses are needed

most.

GUNTHER

Yes, sir. Perhaps I can keep my

brother here with me, he's also very

good with horses.

BASE CAMP OFFICER

Oh no no. Not necessary.

(TO MICHAEL)

Get moving. We leave tonight.

MICHAEL

It's all right, Gunther.

GUNTHER

You are not going. I'll tell them

you are only fourteen, that you're a

boy.

MICHAEL

Father signed me in. He knew my age

-and so do they.

54.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)

Mother obviously never taught you

how to fold a shirt.

GUNTHER

Of course she did. I just wasn't

listening. But you need to listen

now! I promised her, I made her a

solemn promise, that you would be

safe with me. With me, Michael!!

GUNTHER (CONT'D)

They'll never make a head count.

There are too many of us. You can

stay here - slip underneath the bed -

until they move out.

MICHAEL

Then what?

MICHAEL (CONT'D)

Gunther, it will be fine. And when

all the machines break down and they

call up the horses, I'll see you at

the front. We'll be together again.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)

Gunther...

GUNTHER

I'm giving this to you. For luck.

GUNTHER (CONT'D)

To keep you safe.

55.

BASE CAMP OFFICER

Im schnellschritt! Marsch...links!

Zwei, drei, vier!

GERMAN OFFICER

Get back in line! Line!

56.

MICHAEL

I'm hungry. Did you bring food?

GUNTHER

I'm sorry.

MICHAEL

Will Father be ashamed?

GUNTHER

He will pretend to be. Maybe at

first he will be. But in the end, he

will be glad.

MICHAEL

And us? What about us?

JOEY'S SADDLE:

MICHAEL (CONT'D)

I was ready to go. I was proud to

go.

(after a beat, in a very

SMALL VOICE)

I wanted to go.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)

The food in Italy is good.

GUNTHER

Yes.

MICHAEL

What about the women?

57.

GUNTHER

Not as good as the food.

MICHAEL

Because...they've eaten too much of

the food?

GUNTHER

You are too young for war. And

you're too young for women!

MICHAEL

I don't feel so young. Not anymore.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)

Michael.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)

What?

GUNTHER

Go to sleep - we have a big night of

riding ahead. Goodnight, Michael.

MICHAEL

Night night, Gunther.

GERMAN SOLDIER

Hei! In die windmuhle!

GUNTHER

Go, go, go...

MICHAEL

Okay.

58.

BASE CAMP OFFICER

Schroeder.

GUNTHER

Yes, sir.

BASE CAMP OFFICER

A mistake?

GUNTHER

A promise.

BASE CAMP OFFICER

Ja...

59.

EMILIE

Grandpere.

EMILIE (CONT'D)

It's closer today.

GRANDFATHER

The wind plays tricks with the noise

- it's moving away from us.

EMILIE

I can hear it, Grandpere, and there

is no wind. You shouldn't lie to me.

GRANDFATHER

Here. There is no wind here. But

over there - a wind so strong it

will lift you off the ground...

EMILIE

You lie about everything. You say

you aren't worried but it's clear

you are. I know the war is

approaching but you say, "Oh, it's

just a trick of the wind."

60.

GRANDFATHER

(SMILING)

Did I say that?

EMILIE

You started lying when Mama and Papa

went away.

EMILIE (CONT'D)

They're dead. But you won't say so.

Do you think I'll die if you tell me

the truth?

GRANDFATHER

The truth is -

GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)

- you should speak to your elders

with respect.

EMILIE

If you tell me the truth about the

war, I will tell you the truth about

the big horses I've been keeping in

the windmill.

GRANDFATHER

(standing, putting his

hands on his hips)

Now - who is the one telling lies!

GRANDFATHER

In the windmill?

EMILIE

Yes. They were standing in the

windmill waiting for Don Quixote.

This is Francois (Joey) and this is

Claude (Topthorn).

61.

GRANDFATHER

Yeah.

EMILIE

I named them after two boys who

broke my heart last Summer.

GRANDFATHER

They must belong to someone. Horses

like this don't just appear from a

fairy-tale.

EMILIE

Yes - I know, Grandpere. They are

not unicorns - so I will be fair and

wait -- one day.

GRANDFATHER

Emilie... Emilie...

EMILIE

And if no one comes to get them by

night-time, then they belong to me.

GRANDFATHER

Emilie. Look at me. You cannot

ride.

EMILIE

Mother used to tell me how my bones

would give way with the slightest

bump or fall.

GRANDFATHER

Yes. That's right. So it is

settled?

GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)

Good girl.

EMILIE

It will only be settled when I

decide which one to ride first.

GRANDFATHER

But it's - Over my dead body!

EMILIE

At least I won't have long to wait.

62.

EMILIE

(TO JOEY)

I was in love with a boy called

Francois - who had your lovely eyes.

(TO CLAUDE)

Unfortunately he was in love with a

girl called Marie, who had your

teeth. She fell for a boy called

Claude - who broke my heart. And who

I intend to marry one day.

EMILIE (O.S.)

Eyes on me. No talking.

EMILIE (CONT'D)

Today we learn to jump. Did you know

the French cleared one meter eighty-

five at the Paris Olympics to win

the gold medal? Today we will beat

that record.

EMILIE (CONT'D)

This is your jump. When I call

you....be very brave and leap over

it.

63.

EMILIE (CONT'D)

Leap over it! Watch me.

EMILIE (CONT'D)

And now it's your --

JUMP TO:

JUMP TO:

EMILIE

He doesn't think we can do it. But

we will show him, won't we?

EMILIE (CONT'D)

(Her voice shaking)

No need to be afraid.

(Emilie looking down at

how far off the ground

SHE IS)

You are...very tall.

64.

GRANDFATHER

You'll kill yourself.

EMILIE

Only if you get in my way to make me

fall.

GRANDFATHER

Oh please, come off the ladd--

GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)

Find somewhere to hide them. And do

it quickly!!!

GERMAN OFFICER

Halt! Und aussteigen!

GRANDFATHER

My name is Bonnard - this is my

land. Why are you here?

SOLDIERS

Food for the soldiers at the front.

Everyone must give their share.

65.

GRANDFATHER

They are taking everything. Where

are the horses?

EMILIE

What horses?

GERMAN SOLDIER

What is it?

GRANDFATHER

Leave it if you don't know what it's

for.

GERMAN SOLDIER

A pot is a pot. We'll find some use

for it. Sir, where's the livestock?

GRANDFATHER

I make jam. We have no animals.

GERMAN SOLDIER

But there's fresh hay in your barn.

EMILIE

We use it to replace the mattress

stuffings.

GERMAN SOLDIER

Her grandfather?

66.

GRANDFATHER

Yes.

GERMAN SOLDIER

Where are her parents?

EMILIE

(BREAKING IN)

They're dead. They died.

GERMAN SOLDIER

What is that?

GRANDFATHER

The wind. It plays tricks in the

attic.

BRANDT

There is no wind.

GRANDFATHER

An old house creaks.

(TO EMILIE)

Go - close the shutters.

GERMAN SOLDIER

She's sickly, no?

GRANDFATHER

If you or any of your friends harm

her, as old as I am, I will kill

you.

GERMAN SOLDIER

You know, I was going to give you

back your pot. But now I'm going to

keep it. For soup.

67.

BRANDT

We will be back in the new season.

EMILIE

Tell me what happened to them. To my

mother and father.

EMILIE (CONT'D)

You said you would tell me how they

died. On my birthday. And tomorrow's

my birthday! They died fighting,

didn't they? But when the soldiers

COME -

EMILIE (CONT'D)

- you do nothing. You are a coward,

aren't you?

GRANDFATHER

Yes. Yes. It was your parents who

were brave. I make jams.

EMILIE

And you've never done a brave thing

in your life?

GRANDFATHER

Maybe there are different ways to be

brave. Did you know the French have

the best carrier pigeons? And this

could be the difference in the war -

our messages getting through.

68.

EMILIE

I don't want to hear about the

birds.

GRANDFATHER

They are released at the front and

told to go home - this is all they

know. But to get there they must

fly over a war. Can you imagine

such a thing? Here you are flying

over so much pain and terror - and

you know you can never look down.

You have to look forward or you'll

never get home. I ask you - what

could be braver than that?

EMILIE

What is that?

GRANDFATHER

A present.

EMILIE

I hope you have not bought me a

disgusting dress that I then have to

wear like last year.

GRANDFATHER

(LAUGHING)

It was disgusting?

EMILIE

Yes. I looked like an ugly nun.

69.

EMILIE (CONT'D)

Give me your hand.

(she takes it in hers)

Grandpere, we have no money. When

the war is over, then you can buy me

jewels and carriages.

GRANDFATHER

Anything you say, my sweet one.

Anything-you-say! You are, of

course, the boss. It's just an old

thing I found - don't worry yourself

- leave it, I'll put it back.

GRANDFATHER

It was your mother's. I hid it, so

as not to encourage you. Emilie, I

want you to ride very slowly, very

carefully. And promise me you won't

go far --

EMILIE

Of course. Okay, I promise.

GRANDFATHER

To the top of the hill and straight

back again.

EMILIE

I promise.

70.

EMILIE (CONT'D)

My hero.

GRANDFATHER

Slowly...slowly...

GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)

Emilie!

GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)

Emilie!

EMILIE

No! Let go of me! No!

71.

GRANDFATHER

She is my granddaughter! Emilie,

stop! Don't hurt her, please!

Don't hurt her.

EMILIE

You don't need them! There are so

many others!

GRANDFATHER

Please, take the bigger one and

leave the smaller one. You are

breaking my granddaughter's heart.

BRANDT

(LEAVING)

The war has taken everything from

everyone.

GRANDFATHER

(CALLING AFTER)

What will happen to them?

BRANDT

They will pull artillery until they

DIE -

EMILIE

(COUGHING)

Francois!

BRANDT

- or until the war is over.

GRANDFATHER

It will never be over!

BRANDT

You have your answer then.

72.

BRANDT

Heiglemann - these are yours.

FRIEDRICH

Yes, sir.

BRANDT

They look strong - should last a

month or two.

FRIEDRICH

You are beautiful.

FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)

It's a pity they found you.

FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)

Such a pity...

73.

ARTILLERY OFFICER

Pull together!

ARTILLERY SOLDIER

Halt! Halt! Stop!

FRIEDRICH

Stop! Stop!

BRANDT

Heiglemann, bring up another one!

ARTILLERY OFFICER

Heiglemann, bring up another horse!

BRANDT

That one!

BRANDT (CONT'D)

No, no. The big black one!

74.

FRIEDRICH

He's a good horse, sir. But if you

move him up to the heavy gun, he

will be no use at all. Prince is

already losing condition. His leg,

sir.

BRANDT

You have given them names?

FRIEDRICH

Yes, sir.

BRANDT

You should never give a name to

anything you are certain to lose.

FRIEDRICH

His leg is not good enough, sir.

BRANDT

Private, you will do as you are

told.

(CALLING OFF)

Hook him up.

FRIEDRICH

As you see, sir, this one is

stronger.

BRANDT

Hook him up.

75.

OFFICER

Halt! Halt! Take the horses away!

ARTILLERY OFFICER

Shell!

ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)

And load!

ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)

Back! Case!

ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)

Position!

ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)

And...fire!

76.

SERGEANT MARTIN

Valuables in the bucket, lads. If

you live, you'll get them back. If

you live, you'll get them back.

Good lads.

ANDREW

Maybe it's a drill, Albie. Maybe

it's a drill like last time.

77.

DAVID

Love letter?

ALBERT

That's my business.

DAVID

I hear you and your mate were doing

bird imitations again. You gonna

write a letter to your horse?

DAVID (CONT'D)

After you find your horse, I've lost

my needle in a haystack, and I could

use some help.

DAVID (CONT'D)

Anything valuable. Anyone who comes

back gets to share it out.

ALBERT

(TO ANDREW)

Stay here.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Remember that day me and Joey raced

you in your car?

DAVID

I remember you somersaulting through

the air.

ALBERT

Who was that girl you were with?

DAVID

There was a girl?

ALBERT

There was. Don't you remember?

78.

DAVID

It was just some girl, I suppose. I

don't recall which one. I do

remember you falling on your bum in

a ditch.

DAVID (CONT'D)

You see? Always entertaining,

Narracott, I'll give you that.

ANDREW

You did that? You fell on your bum?

SERGEANT MARTIN

Be ready! Be ready! Let's go, men,

get ready to go! Get ready to move

out! Stay in position!

DAVID

Hold your nerve, boys. Remember,

it's not far to go. There's a way

through.

(he moves down the line)

Run fast, keep your wits about you,

keep your eyes open and God and the

King will keep an eye on you.

Company will fix bayonets! Fix

bayonets!

ALBERT

You know what it reminds me of out

there?

79.

ANDREW

What?

ALBERT

That bloody impossible lower field

the day me and Joey plowed it. Best

day of my life that was and you were

there.

ANDREW

And this here is the worst day of my

life, about to begin, and you're

here cheering me on. Us two, always.

And him.

DAVID

Once you're in no man's land, go to

the flanks. Stay on the flanks.

SOLDIER

Yes, sir.

DAVID

Come on, boys, come on. To the

ladder!

ALBERT

(TO ANDREW)

Stick close to the gentry, that's

our ticket, yeah? We have the pluck

but they have the luck.

DAVID

You, too, Narracott.

(TO ANDREW)

And you, too.

80.

DAVID (CONT'D)

Come on, on your ladders, boy. On

your ladders. In you go, in you go.

That's it.

SERGEANT MARTIN

Listen to your sergeant!

SERGEANT MARTIN (CONT'D)

If anybody turns back, if any one of

our boys come running towards you -

you take this rifle and you shoot

them dead. Do you understand?

SOLDIERS

Yes, sir!

SERGEANT

Do you understand me? Do you

understand what I'm telling you,

son? You take this rifle and you

shoot them dead. Understand?

SERGEANT (CONT'D)

Up there, son. Up your ladder. Up

your ladder to your work!

ALBERT

It's good. Andrew, it's good.

Andrew! Nobody's retreating today.

Andrew! Andrew! Nobody. Is

retreating. Today.

81.

DAVID

I'm shot! No!

DAVID (CONT'D)

Just leave me. Leave me!

ALBERT

You'll be all right here. You'll be

safe. Someone'll come for ya.

DAVID

Albert. Albert, listen...

ALBERT

It's all right. It's all right.

We're Devon boys, yeah?

DAVID

Yeah...

82.

RANDOM SOLDIER

Get down!

ANDREW

NO!

83.

ANDREW (CONT'D)

Albie.

ALBERT

We made it. We made it.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

Andrew, this way out!

SOLDIER

Gas! Gas! Gas!

ANDREW

Albie...

GERMAN OFFICER

Hey, there's no stopping here. Keep

them moving.

84.

FRIEDRICH

Sir, there's something wrong. This

one needs to rest.

GERMAN OFFICER

There's no rest for them. Move them

along. Move them along!

FRIEDRICH

Please, please, please. Stay on

your feet. No, please. No no no...

FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)

Please please... Stay on your feet.

DECLINE:

FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)

Come on. Please please...

GERMAN OFFICER

They're coming! Leave it, private!

85.

GERMAN OFFICER (CONT'D)

Leave it! Come with me!

FRIEDRICH

Go to hell!

FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)

Run. Run! Run! Run!

86.

GEORDIE SOLDIER (O.S.)

Stand to, stand to -

GEORDIE SOLDIER (CONT'D)

There's something moving.

SOLDIER

What the hell is it?

GEORDIE SOLDIER

It looks like a cow.

SOLDIER

What the hell would a cow be doing out

there?

SOLDIER 2

That definitely isn't a cow.

SOLDIER

(handing over periscope)

Well, what is it?

87.

SECOND GERMAN

It can't be a horse. Nothing alive could be

out there.

THIRD GERMAN

It isn't a horse. It isn't a horse.

SECOND GERMAN

Yes - it's a horse.

THIRD GERMAN

It's a horse.

PETER

Yeah, it's a horse.

BRITISH CAPTAIN

Well, bugger me. It's a horse.

GEORDIE SOLDIER

Lads, we should call him.

BRITISH SOLDIER

How do you call a horse?

88.

PETER

He's caught on the wire.

GEORDIE SOLDIER

Oh sod it...

BRITISH CAPTAIN

What do you think you're doing? Get

back, do you hear me? Corporal,

that's an order! Get back!

BRITISH SOLDIER

Listen to him, sir. We can't leave him.

PETER

What's he doing?

SECOND GERMAN

It's a trap.

PETER

No, I don't think so. I think he's

trying to help.

THIRD GERMAN

Scare him back into his hole.

89.

GEORDIE

It's a white flag, ent it? You see

the white flag!? I'm just after

tending to this here horse, is all!

BRITISH CAPTAIN

Get back, you stupid git!

GEORDIE

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not

want, he leadeth me into green

pastures, he lay me down beside the

still waters...

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

Poor beastie. Poor babbie. It's

alright. It's alright. Don't buck

and wriggle so, you're only

shredding yourself.

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

You'll blind yourself.

90.

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

Bugger me worthless - I didn't think

to bring gloves or something to cut

THE -

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

OW! DAMN! OW!!

PETER

I thought perhaps you might need

these.

PETER (CONT'D)

For the barbed wire?

GEORDIE

Yeah, yeah I... Ummm, thanks.

Cheers. Cheers...

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

Thanks.

PETER

That...That's a very long strand.

When you cut it, it's going to

release this -

ENTANGLED:

PETER (CONT'D)

- and this, and this, and they'll

coil back rather violently, which

I'm afraid will only wound the poor

fellow further.

91.

GEORDIE

You speak good English.

PETER

I speak English well.

(re: the cutters)

May I?

PETER (CONT'D)

What if we cut his head free first?

So he won't try to stand up and

blind himself? And then -

GEORDIE

Pity you didn't bring a second pair.

Then I could cut the wire here -

PETER

WE NEED MORE WIRE CUTTERS!

PETER (CONT'D)

His blind spot. The cutters won't

frighten him. If you could cut

here, holding this wire -

92.

PETER (CONT'D)

I could -

GEORDIE

Say no more, I'm right behind you.

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

And you understand what's happening,

do you not, O Best Beloved? That you

must lay so very nice and still.

There's a lad, you're a remarkable

horse, you are, helping us help you.

There's a lad. There's a remarkable

lad.

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

So how's things in yonder trench?

PETER

Delightful. We read, we knit

sweaters, and we train our rats to

perform circus tricks.

GEORDIE

Well, if ever you need any more

rats, we can always send ours over.

`Cause we've more than we need,

strictly speaking. Besides, they

scare off all the pretty girls.

PETER

Our girls aren't afraid of rats.

GEORDIE

Big strapping German girls, eh? Kind

what gives robust massages?

PETER

Every Thursday! And they bring rum

cake on your birthday.

93.

GEORDIE

Look at that horse! Look at the

muscles he's got, them long legs.

They're made for running, horses.

Runnin' away from danger.

PETER

Running away is all they have.

GEORDIE

Yet we taught `em opposite. Running

into the fray.

PETER

War horse.

GEORDIE

Yeah. War horse. And there he is.

What a strange beast you've become.

PETER

And now?

GEORDIE

I take him back with me, yeah?

PETER

Since I supplied the cutters, the

horse is mine. This is fair, no?

GEORDIE

In a pig's eye. He's English, plain

to see.

PETER

Oh, you mean because he's so filthy?

GEORDIE

Because he's so smart. And you're

none too clean yourself.

94.

PETER

We could box. And the winner gets

the horse.

GEORDIE

No, thanks, pet. Must be careful not

to start a war.

(patting his pockets:)

Do you have a coin of any sort?

PETER

Coin toss?

GEORDIE

Yeah.

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

All right, Fritz - you're on.

PETER

My name is not Fritz - it is Peter.

GEORDIE

Peter - I'm Colin.

PETER

You call it, Colin.

GEORDIE

Heads.

PETER

That's the face of my Kaiser and he does not

look pleased with me. The horse is yours.

GEORDIE

Gone quiet, hasn't it?

PETER

Yes.

(PAUSE)

(MORE)

95.

PETER (CONT'D)

But wait half an hour and we'll be shooting

again.

GEORDIE

I'm a terrible shot, Pete, don't believe

I'll ever hit the target.

PETER

Thanks.

PETER (CONT'D)

Cheerio, mate.

(RE JOEY:)

You'll take good care of him, yes?

GEORDIE

I will.

PETER

Our strange beast.

GEORDIE

And you take care of your own

strange self.

PETER

Colin! A pair of German cutters - in memory

of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf.

GEORDIE

Thanks.

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

I'll use `em back in the garden in

South Shields. You keep your head

down, now, Pete me lad!

PETER

Remarkable! A remarkable horse!

96.

SERGEANT MARTIN

We're full up. Move on.

DAVID

The gas got him - we had to wait

till morning.

MEDICAL OFFICER

This can't be all of us.

SERGEANT MARTIN

This is all.

(bellowing to the men)

All walking wounded, away to the

dressing station! Away to the

dressing station!

97.

DOCTOR

What's this doing here?

GEORDIE

We need a vet, sir.

DOCTOR

There are no vets. We've scarcely

any horses left.

GEORDIE

He's cut all over, but this leg

here's got the worst of it.

DOCTOR

It's probably tetanus. It's no good.

GEORDIE

Please, sir -

DOCTOR

I've all these men to take care of,

corporal, you can see that, can't

you?

GEORDIE

Please, sir, this horse can pull

through anything.

ALBERT

What is it?

98.

AN ORDERLY

It's a horse they found, wandering about in

No Man's Land.

(easing him back onto a

COT)

Down you go.

ALBERT

What kind of an horse?

AN ORDERLY

Bloody miraculous kind of an horse,

be my guess. Nothing makes it out

of No Man's Land.

ALBERT

Miraculous horse...

GEORDIE

(to the doctor:)

He was alive, y'see, sir, where

nothing survives, so to me and me

mates, to the men, sir, he's - Well,

we have high hopes for him -

DOCTOR

You should shoot him now.

GEORDIE

Oh, but I can't.

DOCTOR

It'd be a mercy, lad, that leg's not

going to mend.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Sergeant. Put him out of his misery.

99.

SERGEANT FRY

Ladies, if you please.

SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)

All right, back off. Back off.

SOLDIER

Go on. Do it again.

ALBERT

Joey?

ALBERT (CONT'D)

(SOFTLY:)

Hello, Joey. Hello boy. Where you

been then, hey? Where in the world

you been?

100.

DOCTOR

(to the Geordie:)

Do you know this man?

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

What's your name?

ALBERT

Narracott, Private Albert Narracott,

sir.

DOCTOR

This is a random horse, Narracott,

and too badly injured.

(to the orderly)

Is this man in your care?

AN ORDERLY

Yes, sir.

ALBERT

He's not random at all, sir! He's my

horse, I raised him, in Devon. Sir,

look at his legs! He's got four

white socks, he's brown all over -

(points to his own

FOREHEAD)

- and he has a white mark here -

like so...

DOCTOR

Take him back.

AN ORDERLY

Come on, son.

GEORDIE

Wait! You can't see `cause of the

mud.

101.

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

Four white socks!

SERGEANT FRY

All right, break it up. Clear off,

the lot of ya.

ALBERT

You see, sir? He's not random at

all.

DOCTOR

We will attend to your horse. Patch

him up best we can. Treat him like

the soldier he is.

ALBERT

Thank you, sir.

SERGEANT FRY

Gentlemen! Gentlemen! It falls on me to give

you some important news. At eleven o'clock

today, in two minutes time - the War will

come to an end.

SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)

The King and Queen thank you for your

service. We have been victorious - even if

at a higher price than many of us might have

imagined.

(MORE)

102.

SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)

When the bells ring out - and they will in a

moment, for the first time for four years -

let us remember our brothers fallen in the

field. And thank God for the end of this

struggle and victory.

ALBERT

I don't understand, sir.

MAJOR TOMPKINS

Officers' horses only. All other

horses are to be auctioned

immediately.

SERGEANT FRY

That is a complete and bloody outrage. It's

the lad's horse, sir, from Devon. He raised

him up from a pup, he did. Trained him

right up to the day when the army came to

town.

MAJOR TOMPKINS

These aren't my orders, sergeant.

(TO ALBERT)

You'll have to take him to market. That's

all.

GEORDIE

We've all clubbed together. It's everything

we have. There's twenty-nine pounds there.

Buy him back.

103.

ALBERT

Does the Major know?

GEORDIE

The Major put in ten.

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

Mum's the word where the Major's

concerned. Your friend on the

crutches over there -

GEORDIE (CONT'D)

- even asked the Major to say that

Joey was his, an officer's horse, so

that he could go back with the

others.

SERGEANT FRY

Come on, Narracott! Get a move on. We don't

want to miss the show.

AUCTIONEER

Seven pounds! Seven pounds there!

Seven pounds! Eight pounds here!

AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)

Eight pounds! Ten pounds here! Any

advance? Sold!

104.

GEORDIE

You're alright. Nobody's gonna bid more than

fifteen for a thoroughbred. They want work

horses.

AUCTIONEER

Next one. We start at four pounds.

Four pounds.

THE BUTCHER

Eleven.

SERGEANT FRY

It's the butcher from Cambrai. He's

been bidding for the best all

morning.

AUCTIONEER

Eleven. Eleven pounds. Eleven pounds.

SERGEANT FRY

Let me handle this, private.

(he calls out) )

Fifteen, and let that be an end to it.

AUCTIONEER

Fifteen pounds.

BUTCHER

Sixteen.

AUCTIONEER

Sixteen pounds.

SERGEANT FRY

Seventeen.

BUTCHER

Twenty of your English pounds. And let THAT

be the end of it, my friend.

105.

AUCTIONEER

Twenty pounds.

SERGEANT FRY

Twenty Five.

AUCTIONEER

Twenty five pounds.

BUTCHER

Twenty Six.

AUCTIONEER

Twenty six pounds.

SERGEANT FRY

Twenty seven.

BUTCHER

Twenty eight.

AUCTIONEER

Twenty eight pounds.

SERGEANT FRY

Twenty nine.

BUTCHER

And thirty.

AUCTIONEER

Any advance at thirty pounds?

FINAL BIDDER

One hundred pounds.

GRANDFATHER

And sir, if you bid against me, I will sell

the coat on my back and bid to one hundred

and ten. And if you bid against me again, I

will sell my farm and bid to a thousand.

106.

AUCTIONEER

One hundred pounds. Going, going,

gone.

ALBERT

Sir, I'll give you all your money.

Everything you paid when we get back

to England. I'll give you twice -

GRANDFATHER

You don't know anything about him.

ALBERT

Oh, but you're wrong, sir, I know

everything!

GRANDFATHER

Yes, you found him! I heard you

found a horse in the wire between

the armies -

GEORDIE

No, I found him, he raised him -

GRANDFATHER

When I heard about the miracle

horse, I traveled three days because

I knew whose horse it was. My

granddaughter's. She saved his life!

He was everything to her.

GEORDIE

Where is your granddaughter?

GRANDFATHER

The war has taken everything from

everyone. He is all that I have left

of her.

107.

ALBERT

Don't be worried, boy, when I go. I

won't worry over you none. Hey, I

found you, didn't I, and you found

me.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

And we'll both... we'll both know

that we made it through. Now go on.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

We're the lucky ones. Always have

been. Lucky since the day I met you.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

God be with you, sir.

GRANDFATHER

Do you know what this is?

ALBERT

It's my father's. It's his

regimental pennant. How did you come

by this, sir?

GRANDFATHER

You may have this.

ALBERT

Thank you ever so much for this,

sir...

108.

GRANDFATHER

(with a sigh)

... And this.

GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)

No no, not necessary. He belongs to

you. That is, of course, what my

little girl would have wanted. And

she was the boss.

ALBERT

What was her name?

GRANDFATHER

Emilie.

(turns back with a smile)

Her name is Emilie.

109.
