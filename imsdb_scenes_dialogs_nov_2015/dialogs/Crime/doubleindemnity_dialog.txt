SEQUENCE "A"

NIGHT WATCHMAN

Hello there, Mr. Neff.

NIGHT WATCHMAN

Working pretty late aren't you, Mr.

Neff?

NEFF

(Tight-lipped)

Late enough.

NIGHT WATCHMAN

You look kind of all in at that.

NEFF

I'm fine. Let's ride.

NIGHT WATCHMAN

How's the insurance business, Mr.

Neff?

NEFF

Okay.

NIGHT WATCHMAN

They wouldn't ever sell me any. They

say I've got something loose in my

heart. I say it's rheumatism.

NEFF

(Scarcely listening)

Uh-huh.

NIGHT WATCHMAN

(Surly)

Twelve.

NEFF

Office memorandum, Walter Neff to

Barton Keyes, Claims Manager. Los

Angeles, July 16th, 1938. Dear Keyes:

I suppose you'll call this a

confession when you hear it. I don't

like the word confession. I just

want to set you right about one thing

you couldn't see, because it was

smack up against your nose. You think

you're such a hot potato as a claims

manager, such a wolf on a phoney

claim. Well, maybe you are, Keyes,

but let's take a look at this

Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double

Indemnity. You were pretty good in

there for a while, all right. You

said it wasn't an accident. Check.

You said it wasn't suicide. Check.

You said it was murder. Check and

double check. You thought you had it

cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper,

with pink ribbons around it. It was

perfect, except that it wasn't,

because you made a mistake, just one

tiny little mistake. When it came to

picking the killer, you picked the

wrong guy, if you know what I mean.

Want to know who killed Dietrichson?

Hold tight to that cheap cigar of

yours, Keyes. I killed Dietrichson.

Me, Walter Neff, insurance agent, 35

years old, unmarried, no visible

scars --

(He glances down at

his wounded shoulder)

Until a little while ago, that is.

Yes, I killed him. I killed him for

money -- and a woman -- and I didn't

get the money and I didn't get the

woman. Pretty, isn't it?

NEFF

(His voice is now

quiet and contained)

It began last May. About the end of

May, it was. I had to run out to

Glendale to deliver a policy on some

dairy trucks. On the way back I

remembered this auto renewal on Los

Feliz. So I decided to run over there.

It was one of those Calif. Spanish

houses everyone was nuts about 10 or

15 years ago. This one must have

cost somebody about 30,000 bucks --

that is, if he ever finished paying

for it.

NEFF'S VOICE

It was mid-afternoon, and it's funny,

I can still remember the smell of

honeysuckle all along that block. I

felt like a million. There was no

way in all this world I could have

known that murder sometimes can smell

like honeysuckle...

NEFF

Mr. Dietrichson in?

MAID

Who wants to see him?

NEFF

The name is Neff. Walter Neff.

MAID

If you're selling something --

NEFF

Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I'd like

to talk to, and it's not magazine

subscriptions.

MAID

Listen, Mr. Dietrichson's not in.

NEFF

How soon do you expect him?

MAID

He'll be home when he gets here, if

that's any help to you.

VOICE

What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

MAID'S VOICE

It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

PHYLLIS

(Looking down at Neff)

I'm Mrs. Dietrichson. What is it?

NEFF

How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'm

Walter Neff, Pacific All-Risk.

PHYLLIS

Pacific all-what?

NEFF

Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company.

It's about some renewals on the

automobiles, Mrs. Dietrichson. I've

been trying to contact your husband

for the past two weeks. He's never

at his office.

PHYLLIS

Is there anything I can do?

NEFF

The insurance ran out on the

fifteenth. I'd hate to think of your

getting a smashed fender or something

while you're not fully covered.

PHYLLIS

(With a little smile)

Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr.

Neff. I've just been taking a sun

bath.

NEFF

No pigeons around, I hope... About

those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson --

I hate to take up your time --

PHYLLIS

That's all right. If you can wait

till I put something on, I'll be

right down. Nettie, show Mr. Neff

into the living room.

NEFF

Where would the living room be?

MAID

In there, but they keep the liquor

locked up.

NEFF

That's okay. I always carry my own

keys.

NEFF'S VOICE

The living room was still stuffy

from last night's cigars. The windows

were closed and the sunshine coming

in through the Venetian blinds showed

up the dust in the air. The furniture

was kind of corny and old-fashioned,

but it had a comfortable look, as if

people really sat in it. On the piano,

in couple of fancy frames, were Mr.

Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter

by his first wife They had a bowl of

those little red goldfish on the

table behind the davenport, but, to

tell you the truth, Keyes, I wasn't

a whole lot interested in goldfish

right then, nor in auto renewals,

nor in Mr. Dietrichson and his

daughter Lola. I was thinking about

that dame upstairs, and the way she

had looked at me, and I wanted to

see her again, close, without that

silly staircase between us.

PHYLLIS' VOICE

I wasn't long, was I?

NEFF'S VOICE

Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

PHYLLIS

I hope I've got my face on straight.

NEFF

It's perfect for my money.

PHYLLIS

(Crossing to the mirror

over the fireplace)

Won't you sit down, Mr. -- Neff is

the name, isn't it?

NEFF

With two f's, like in Philadelphia.

If you know the story.

PHYLLIS

What story?

NEFF

The Philadelphia story. What are we

talking about?

PHYLLIS

(She works with her

lipstick)

About the insurance. My husband never

tells me anything.

NEFF

It's on your two cars, the La Salle

and the Plymouth.

NEFF

We've been handling this insurance

for three years for Mr. Dietrichson...

(His eyes have caught

the anklet)

That's a honey of an anklet you're

wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

NEFF

We'd hate to see the policies lapse.

Of course, we give him thirty days.

That's all we're allowed to give.

PHYLLIS

I guess he's been too busy down at

Long Beach in the oil fields.

NEFF

Could I catch him home some evening

for a few minutes?

PHYLLIS

I suppose so. But he's never home

much before eight.

NEFF

That would be fine with me.

PHYLLIS

You're not connected with the

Automobile Club, are you?

NEFF

No, the All-Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson.

Why?

PHYLLIS

Somebody from the Automobile Club

has been trying to get him. Do they

have a better rate?

NEFF

If your husband's a member.

PHYLLIS

No, he isn't.

NEFF

Well, he'd have to join the club and

pay a membership fee to start with.

The Automobile Club is fine. I never

knock the other fellow's merchandise,

Mrs. Dietrichson, but I can do just

as well for you. I have a very

attractive policy here. It wouldn't

take me two minutes to put it in

front of your husband.

NEFF

For instance, we're writing a new

kind of fifty percent retention

feature in the collision coverage.

PHYLLIS

You're a smart insurance man, aren't

you, Mr. Neff?

NEFF

I've had eleven years of it.

PHYLLIS

Doing pretty well?

NEFF

It's a living.

PHYLLIS

You handle just automobile insurance,

or all kinds?

NEFF

All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,

public liability, group insurance,

industrial stuff and so on right

down the line.

PHYLLIS

Accident insurance?

NEFF

Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs.

Dietrichson.

NEFF

I wish you'd tell me what's engraved

on that anklet.

PHYLLIS

Just my name.

NEFF

As for instance?

PHYLLIS

Phyllis.

NEFF

Phyllis. I think I like that.

PHYLLIS

But you're not sure?

NEFF

I'd have to drive it around the block

a couple of times.

PHYLLIS

(Standing up again)

Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by

tomorrow evening about eight-thirty.

He'll be in then.

NEFF

Who?

PHYLLIS

My husband. You were anxious to talk

to him weren't you?

NEFF

Sure, only I'm getting over it a

little. If you know what I mean.

PHYLLIS

There's a speed limit in this state,

Mr. Neff. Forty-five miles an hour.

NEFF

How fast was I going, officer?

PHYLLIS

I'd say about ninety.

NEFF

Suppose you get down off your

motorcycle and give me a ticket.

PHYLLIS

Suppose I let you off with a warning

this time.

NEFF

Suppose it doesn't take.

PHYLLIS

Suppose I have to whack you over the

knuckles.

NEFF

Suppose I bust out crying and put my

head on your shoulder.

PHYLLIS

Suppose you try putting it on my

husband's shoulder.

NEFF

That tears it.

NEFF

Eight-thirty tomorrow evening then,

Mrs. Dietrichson.

PHYLLIS

That's what I suggested.

NEFF

Will you be here, too?

PHYLLIS

I guess so. I usually am.

NEFF

Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?

PHYLLIS

(Opening the door)

I wonder if I know what you mean.

NEFF

I wonder if you wonder.

NEFF'S VOICE

(Over scene)

She liked me. I could feel that. The

way you feel when the cards are...

NEFF'S VOICE

falling right for you, with a nice

little pile of blue and yellow chips

in the middle of the table. Only

what I didn't know then was that I

wasn't playing her. She was playing

me -- with a deck of marked cards --

and the stakes weren't any blue and

yellow chips. They were dynamite. I

went back to the office that afternoon

to see if I had any mail. It was the

same afternoon you had that Sam

Gorlopis on the carpet, that truck

driver from Inglewood, remember,

Keyes?

DISSOLVE TO:

SECRETARY

Oh, Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see

you. He's been yelling for you all

afternoon.

NEFF

Is he sore, or just frothing at the

mouth a little? Here, park these for

me, sweetheart.

BARTON KEYES - CLAIMS MANAGER

KEYES

Wise up, Gorlopis. You're not kidding

anybody with that line of bull. You're

in a jam and you know it.

GORLOPIS

Sez you. All I want is my money.

KEYES

Sez you. All you're gonna get is the

cops.

KEYES

Come in, Walter. This is Sam Gorlopis

from Inglewood.

NEFF

Sure, I know Mr. Gorlopis. Wrote a

policy on his truck. How are you,

Mr. Gorlopis?

GORLOPIS

I ain't so good. My truck burned

down.

KEYES

Yeah, he just planted his big foot

on the starter and the whole thing

blazed up in his face.

GORLOPIS

Yes, sir.

KEYES

And didn't even singe his eyebrows.

GORLOPIS

No sir. Look, mister. I got twenty-

six hundred bucks tied up in that

truck. I'm insured with this company

and I want my money.

KEYES

You got a wife, Gorlopis?

GORLOPIS

Sure I got a wife.

KEYES

You got kids?

GORLOPIS

Two kids.

KEYES

What you got for dinner tonight?

GORLOPIS

We got meat loaf.

KEYES

How do you make your meat loaf,

Gorlopis?

GORLOPIS

Veal and pork and bread and garlic.

Greek style.

KEYES

How much garlic?

GORLOPIS

Lotsa garlic, Mr. Keyes.

KEYES

Okay, Gorlopis. Now listen here.

Let's say you just came up here to

tell me how to make meat loaf. That's

all, understand? Because if you came

up here to claim on that truck, I'd

have to turn you over to the law,

Gorlopis, and they'd put you in jail.

No wife. No kids --

GORLOPIS

What for?

KEYES

(Yelling)

And no meat loaf, Gorlopis!

GORLOPIS

I didn't do nothin'.

KEYES

No? Look, Gorlopis. Every month

hundreds of claims come to this desk.

Some of them are phonies, and I know

which ones. How do I know, Gorlopis?

(He speaks as if to a

child)

Because my little man tells me.

GORLOPIS

What little man?

KEYES

The little man in here.

KEYES

Every time one of those phonies comes

along he ties knots in my stomach.

And yours was one of them, Gorlopis.

That's how I knew your claim was

crooked. So what did I do? I sent a

tow car out to your garage this

afternoon and they jacked up that

burned-out truck of yours. And what

did they find, Gorlopis? They found

what was left of a pile of shavings.

GORLOPIS

What shavings?

KEYES

The ones you soaked with kerosene

and dropped a match on.

GORLOPIS

Look, Mr. Keyes, I'm just a poor

guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

KEYES

That's one way of putting it.

GORLOPIS

I ain't feelin' so good, Mr. Keyes.

KEYES

Sign this and you'll feel fine.

KEYES

Right there. It's a waiver on your

claim.

KEYES

Now you're an honest man again.

GORLOPIS

But I ain't got no more truck.

KEYES

Goodbye, Gorlopis.

GORLOPIS

(Still bewildered)

Goodbye, Mr. Keyes.

GORLOPIS

Twenty-six hundred bucks. That's a

lot of dough where I live.

KEYES

What's the matter, Gorlopis? Don't

you know how to open the door? Just

put your hand on the knob, turn it

to the right, pull it toward you --

GORLOPIS

(Doing just as Keyes

says)

Like this, Mr. Keyes?

KEYES

That's the boy. Now the same thing

from the outside.

GORLOPIS

(Stupefied)

Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

KEYES

What kind of an outfit is this anyway?

Are we an insurance company, or a

bunch of dimwitted amateurs, writing

a policy on a mugg like that?

NEFF

Wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate

this beef. I clipped a note to that

Gorlopis application to have him

thoroughly investigated before we

accepted the risk.

KEYES

I know you did, Walter. I'm not

beefing at you. It's the company.

The way they do things. The way they

don't do things. The way they'll

write anything just to get it down

on the sales sheet. And I'm the guy

that has to sit here up to my neck

in phony claims so they won't throw

more money out of the window than

they take in at the door.

NEFF

(Grinning)

Okay, turn the record over and let's

hear the other side.

KEYES

I get darn sick of picking up after

a gang of fast-talking salesmen dumb

enough to sell life insurance to a

guy that sleeps in the same bed with

four rattlesnakes. I've had twenty-

six years of that, Walter, and I --

NEFF

And you loved every minute of it,

Keyes. You love it, only you worry

about it too much, you and your little

man. You're so darn conscientious

you're driving yourself crazy. You

wouldn't even say today is Tuesday

without you looked at the calendar,

and then you would check if it was

this year's or last year's calendar,

and then you would find out what

company printed the calendar, then

find out if their calendar checks

with the World Almanac's calendar.

KEYES

That's enough from you, Walter. Get

out of here before I throw my desk

at you.

NEFF

I love you, too.

NEFF'S VOICE

(Over scene)

I really did, too, you old crab,

always yelling your fat head off,

always sore at everyone. But behind

the cigar ashes on your vest I kind

of knew you had a heart as big as a

house... Back in my office there was

a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson

about the renewals. She didn't want

me to come tomorrow evening. She

wanted me to come Thursday afternoon

at three-thirty instead. I had a lot

of stuff lined up for that Thursday

afternoon, including a trip down to

Santa Monica to see a couple of live

prospects about some group insurance.

But I kept thinking about Phyllis

Dietrichson and the way that anklet

of hers cut into her leg.

DISSOLVE TO:

PHYLLIS

Hello, Mr. Neff.

PHYLLIS

Aren't you coming in?

NEFF

I'm considering it.

PHYLLIS

I hope you didn't mind my changing

the appointment. Last night wasn't

so convenient.

NEFF

That's okay. I was working on my

stamp collection.

PHYLLIS

I was just fixing some iced tea.

Would you like a glass?

NEFF

Unless you have a bottle of beer

that's not working.

PHYLLIS

There might be some. I never know

what's in the ice box.

(Calls)

Nettie!...

PHYLLIS

About those renewals, Mr. Neff. I

talked to my husband about it.

NEFF

You did?

PHYLLIS

Yes. He'll renew with you he told

me. In fact, I thought he'd be here

this afternoon.

NEFF

But he's not?

PHYLLIS

No.

NEFF

That's terrible.

PHYLLIS

(Calls again,

impatiently)

Nettie!... Nettie!... Oh, I forgot,

it's the maid's day off.

NEFF

Don't bother, Mrs. Dietrichson. I'd

like some iced tea very much.

PHYLLIS

Lemon? Sugar?

NEFF

Fix it your way.

NEFF

Seeing it's the maid's day off maybe

there's something I can do for you.

NEFF

Like running the vacuum cleaner.

PHYLLIS

Fresh.

NEFF

I used to peddle vacuum cleaners.

Not much money but you learn a lot

about life.

PHYLLIS

I didn't think you'd learned it from

a correspondence course.

NEFF

Where did you pick up this tea

drinking? You're not English, are

you?

PHYLLIS

No. Californian. Born right here in

Los Angeles.

NEFF

They say native Californians all

come from Iowa.

PHYLLIS

I wanted to ask you something, Mr.

Neff.

NEFF

Make it Walter.

PHYLLIS

Walter.

NEFF

Right.

PHYLLIS

Tell me, Walter, on this insurance --

how much commission do you make?

NEFF

Twenty percent. Why?

PHYLLIS

I thought maybe I could throw a little

more business your way.

NEFF

I can always use it.

PHYLLIS

I was thinking about my husband. I

worry a lot about him, down in those

oil fields. It's very dangerous.

NEFF

Not for an executive, is it?

PHYLLIS

He doesn't just sit behind a desk.

He's right down there with the

drilling crews. It's got me worried

sick.

NEFF

You mean a crown block might fall on

him some rainy night?

PHYLLIS

Please don't talk like that.

NEFF

But that's the idea.

PHYLLIS

The other day a casing line snapped

and caught the foreman. He's in the

hospital with a broken back.

NEFF

Bad.

PHYLLIS

It's got me jittery just thinking

about it. Suppose something like

that happened to my husband?

NEFF

It could.

PHYLLIS

Don't you think he ought to have

accident insurance?

NEFF

Uh huh.

PHYLLIS

What kind of insurance could he have?

NEFF

Enough to cover doctors' and hospital

bills. Say a hundred and twenty-five

a week cash benefit. And he'd rate

around fifty thousand capital sum.

PHYLLIS

Capital sum? What's that?

NEFF

That's if he got killed. Maybe I

shouldn't have said that.

PHYLLIS

I suppose you have to think of

everything in your business.

NEFF

Mr. Dietrichson would understand.

I'm sure I could sell him on the

idea of some accident protection.

Why don't I talk to him about it.

PHYLLIS

You could try. But he's pretty tough

going.

NEFF

They're all tough at first.

PHYLLIS

He's got a lot on his mind. He doesn't

want to listen to anything except

maybe a baseball game on the radio.

Sometimes we sit all evening without

saying a word to each other.

NEFF

Sounds pretty dull.

PHYLLIS

So I just sit and knit.

NEFF

Is that what you married him for?

PHYLLIS

Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold

up the wool.

NEFF

Anytime his thumbs get tired --

PHYLLIS

I want to ask you something, Mr.

Neff. Could I get an accident policy

for him -- without bothering him at

all?

NEFF

How's that again.

PHYLLIS

That would make it easier for you,

too. You wouldn't even have to talk

to him. I have a little allowance of

my own. I could pay for it and he

needn't know anything about it.

NEFF

Wait a minute. Why shouldn't he know?

PHYLLIS

Because I know he doesn't want

accident insurance. He's superstitious

about it.

NEFF

A lot of people are. Funny, isn't

it?

PHYLLIS

If there was a way to get it like

that, all the worry would be over.

You see what I mean, Walter?

NEFF

Sure. I've got good eyesight. You

want him to have the policy without

him knowing it. And that means without

the insurance company knowing that

he doesn't know. That's the set-up,

isn't it?

PHYLLIS

Is there anything wrong with it?

NEFF

I think it's lovely. And then, some

dark wet night, if that crown block

fell on him --

PHYLLIS

What crown block?

NEFF

Only sometimes they have to have a

little help. They can't quite make

it on their own.

PHYLLIS

I don't know what you're talking

about.

NEFF

Of course, it doesn't have to be a

crown block. It can be a car backing

over him, or he can fall out of an

upstairs window. Any little thing

like that, as long as it's a morgue

job.

PHYLLIS

Are you crazy?

NEFF

Not that crazy. Goodbye, Mrs.

Dietrichson.

PHYLLIS

What's the matter?

NEFF

Look, baby, you can't get away with

it.

PHYLLIS

Get away with what?

NEFF

You want to knock him off, don't

you, baby.

PHYLLIS

That's a horrible thing to say!

NEFF

Who'd you think I was, anyway? A guy

that walks into a good-looking dame's

front parlor and says "Good afternoon,

I sell accident insurance on husbands.

You got one that's been around too

long? Somebody you'd like to turn

into a little hard cash? Just give

me a smile and I'll help you collect."

Boy, what a dope I must look to you!

PHYLLIS

I think you're rotten.

NEFF

I think you're swell. So long as I'm

not your husband.

PHYLLIS

Get out of here.

NEFF

You bet I will. You bet I'll get out

of here, baby. But quick.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

(Over scene)

So I let her have it, straight between

the eyes. She didn't fool me for a

minute, not this time. I knew I had

hold of a redhot poker and the time

to drop it was before it burned my

hand off. I stopped at a drive-in

for a bottle of beer, the one I had

wanted all along, only I wanted it

worse now, to get rid of the sour

taste of her iced tea, and everything

that went with it. I didn't want to

go back to the office, so I dropped

by a bowling alley at Third and

Western and rolled a few lines to

get my mind thinking about something

else for a while.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

(Continuing)

I didn't feel like eating dinner

when I left, and I didn't feel like

a show, so I drove home, put the car

away and went up to my apartment.

NEFF'S VOICE

(Continuing)

It had begun to rain outside and I

watched it get dark and didn't even

turn on the light. That didn't help

me either. I was all twisted up

inside, and I was still holding on

to that red-hot poker. And right

then it came over me that I hadn't

walked out on anything at all, that

the hook was too strong, that this

wasn't the end between her and me.

It was only the beginning.

NEFF'S VOICE

(Continuing)

So at eight o'clock the bell would

ring and I would know who it was

without even having to think, as if

it was the most natural thing in the

world.

PHYLLIS

Hello.

PHYLLIS

You forgot your hat this afternoon.

NEFF

Did I?

PHYLLIS

Don't you want me to bring it in?

NEFF

Sure. Put it on the chair.

NEFF

How did you know where I live?

PHYLLIS

It's in the phone book.

PHYLLIS

It's raining.

NEFF

So it is. Peel off your coat and sit

down.

NEFF

Your husband out?

PHYLLIS

Long Beach. They're spudding in a

new well. He phoned he'd be late.

About nine-thirty.

PHYLLIS

It's about time you said you're glad

to see me.

NEFF

I knew you wouldn't leave it like

that.

PHYLLIS

Like what?

NEFF

Like it was this afternoon.

PHYLLIS

I must have said something that gave

you a terribly wrong impression. You

must surely see that. You must never

think anything like that about me,

Walter.

NEFF

Okay.

PHYLLIS

It's not okay. Not if you don't

believe me.

NEFF

What do you want me to do?

PHYLLIS

I want you to be nice to me. Like

the first time you came to the house.

NEFF

It can't be like the first time.

Something has happened.

PHYLLIS

I know it has. It's happened to us.

NEFF

That's what I mean.

NEFF

What's the matter now?

PHYLLIS

I feel as if he was watching me. Not

that he cares about me. Not any more.

But he keeps me on a leash. So tight

I can't breathe. I'm scared.

NEFF

What of? He's in Long Beach, isn't

he?

PHYLLIS

I oughtn't to have come.

NEFF

Maybe you oughtn't.

PHYLLIS

You want me to go?

NEFF

If you want to.

PHYLLIS

Right now?

NEFF

Sure. Right now.

NEFF

How were you going to do it?

PHYLLIS

Do what?

NEFF

Kill him.

PHYLLIS

Walter, for the last time --

NEFF

I'm crazy about you, baby.

PHYLLIS

I'm crazy about you, Walter.

NEFF

That perfume on your hair. What's

the name of it?

PHYLLIS

Something French. I bought it down

at Ensenada.

NEFF

We ought to have some of that pink

wine to go with it. The kind that

bubbles. But all I have is bourbon.

PHYLLIS

Bourbon is fine, Walter.

NEFF

Soda?

PHYLLIS

Plain water, please.

NEFF

Get a couple of glasses, will you.

NEFF

You know, about six months ago a guy

slipped on the soap in his bathtub

and knocked himself cold and drowned.

Only he had accident insurance. So

they had an autopsy and she didn't

get away with it.

PHYLLIS

Who didn't?

NEFF

His wife.

NEFF

And there was another case where a

guy was found shot and his wife said

he was cleaning a gun and his stomach

got in the way. All she collected

was a three-to-ten stretch in

Tehachapi.

PHYLLIS

Perhaps it was worth it to her.

NEFF

See if you can carry this as far as

the living room.

PHYLLIS

It's nice here, Walter. Who takes

care of it for you?

NEFF

A colored woman comes in twice a

week.

PHYLLIS

You get your own breakfast?

NEFF

Once in a while I squeeze a

grapefruit. The rest I get at the

corner drugstore.

PHYLLIS

It sounds wonderful. Just strangers

beside you. You don't know them. You

don't hate them. You don't have to

sit across the table and smile at

him and that daughter of his every

morning of your life.

NEFF

What daughter? Oh, that little girl

on the piano.

PHYLLIS

Yes. Lola. She lives with us. He

thinks a lot more of her than he

does of me.

NEFF

Ever think of a divorce?

PHYLLIS

He wouldn't give me a divorce.

NEFF

I suppose because it would cost him

money.

PHYLLIS

He hasn't got any money. Not since

he went into the oil business.

NEFF

But he had when you married him?

PHYLLIS

Yes, he had. And I wanted a home.

Why not? But that wasn't the only

reason. I was his wife's nurse. She

was sick for a long time. When she

died, he was all broken up. I pitied

him so.

NEFF

And now you hate him.

PHYLLIS

Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me.

Every-time I buy a dress or a pair

of shoes he yells his head off. He

won't let me go anywhere. He keeps

me shut up. He's always been mean to

me. Even his life insurance all goes

to that daughter of his. That Lola.

NEFF

Nothing for you at all, huh?

PHYLLIS

No. And nothing is just what I'm

worth to him.

NEFF

So you lie awake in the dark and

listen to him snore and get ideas.

PHYLLIS

Walter, I don't want to kill him. I

never did. Not even when he gets

drunk and slaps my face.

NEFF

Only sometimes you wish he was dead.

PHYLLIS

Perhaps I do.

NEFF

And you wish it was an accident, and

you had that policy. For fifty

thousand dollars. Is that it?

PHYLLIS

Perhaps that too.

PHYLLIS

The other night we drove home from a

party. He was drunk again. When we

got into the garage he just sat there

with his head on the steering wheel

and the motor still running. And I

thought what it would be like if I

didn't switch it off, just closed

the garage door and left him there.

NEFF

I'll tell you what it would be like,

if you had that accident policy, and

tried to pull a monoxide job. We

have a guy in our office named Keyes.

For him a set-up like that would be

just like a slice of rare roast beef.

In three minutes he'd know it wasn't

an accident. In ten minutes you'd be

sitting under the hot lights. In

half an hour you'd be signing your

name to a confession.

PHYLLIS

But Walter, I didn't do it. I'm not

going to do it.

NEFF

Not if there's an insurance company

in the picture, baby. So long as

you're honest they'll pay you with a

smile, but you just try to pull

something like that and you'll find

out. They know more tricks than a

carload of monkeys. And if there's a

death mixed up in it, you haven't

got a prayer. They'll hang you as

sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar,

baby.

NEFF

Just stop thinking about it, will

you.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF

So we just sat there, and she kept

on crying softly, like the rain on

the window, and we didn't say

anything. Maybe she had stopped

thinking about it, but I hadn't. I

couldn't. Because it all tied up

with something I had been thinking

about for years, since long before I

ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

Because, in this business you can't

sleep for trying to figure out the

tricks they could pull on you. You're

like the guy behind the roulette

wheel, watching the customers to

make sure they don't crook the house.

And then one night, you get to

thinking how you could crook the

house yourself. And do it smart.

Because you've got that wheel right

under your hands. And you know every

notch in it by heart. And you figure

all you need is a plant out in front,

a shill to put down the bet. And

suddenly the doorbell rings and the

whole set-up is right there in the

room with you... Look, Keyes, I'm

not trying to whitewash myself. I

fought it, only maybe I didn't fight

it hard enough. The stakes were fifty

thousand dollars, but they were the

life of a man, too, a man who'd never

done me any dirt. Except he was

married to a woman he didn't care

anything about, and I did...

DISSOLVE TO:

PHYLLIS

I've got to go now, Walter.

PHYLLIS

Will you call me, Walter?

PHYLLIS

Walter!

PHYLLIS

I hate him. I loathe going back to

him. You believe me, don't you,

Walter?

NEFF

Sure I believe you.

PHYLLIS

I can't stand it anymore. What if

they did hang me?

NEFF

You're not going to hang, baby.

PHYLLIS

It's better than going on this way.

NEFF

-- you're not going to hang, baby.

Not ever. Because you're going to do

it the smart way. Because I'm going

to help you.

PHYLLIS

You!

NEFF

Me.

PHYLLIS

Do you know what you're saying?

NEFF

Sure I know what I'm saying.

NEFF

We're going to do it together. We're

going to do it right. And I'm the

guy that knows how.

PHYLLIS

Walter, you're hurting me.

NEFF

There isn't going to be any slip up.

Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak. It's

got to be perfect.

NEFF

You go now.

NEFF

Call me tomorrow. But not from your

house. From a booth. And watch your

step. Every single minute. It's got

to be perfect, understand. Straight

down the line.

PHYLLIS

Straight down the line.

FADE OUT:

END OF SEQUENCE "A"

SEQUENCE "B"

NEFF

The first thing we had to do was fix

him up with that accident policy. I

knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted

was his signature on an application.

So I had to make him sign without

his knowing what he was signing. And

I wanted a witness other than Phyllis

to hear me give him a sales talk. I

was trying to think with your brains,

Keyes. I wanted all the answers ready

for all the questions you were going

to spring as soon as Dietrichson was

dead.

NEFF

A couple of nights later I went to

the house. Everything looked fine,

except I didn't like the witness

Phyllis had brought in. It was

Dietrichson's daughter Lola, and it

made me feel a little queer in the

belly to have her right there in the

room, playing Chinese checkers, as

if nothing was going to happen.

DISSOLVE:

NEFF

I suppose you realize, Mr.

Dietrichson, that, not being an

employee, you are not covered by the

State Compensation Insurance Act.

The only way you can protect yourself

is by having a personal policy of

your own.

DIETRICHSON

I know all about that. The next thing

you'll tell me I need earthquake

insurance and lightning insurance

and hail insurance.

PHYLLIS

(To Dietrichson)

If we bought all the insurance they

can think up, we'd stay broke paying

for it, wouldn't we, honey?

DIETRICHSON

What keeps us broke is you going out

and buying five hats at a crack. Who

needs a hat in California?

NEFF

I always say insurance is a lot like

a hot water bottle. It looks kind of

useless and silly hanging on the

hook, but when you get that stomach

ache in the middle of the night, it

comes in mighty handy.

DIETRICHSON

Now you want to sell me a hot water

bottle.

NEFF

Dollar for dollar, accident insurance

is the cheapest coverage you can

buy, Mr. Dietrichson.

DIETRICHSON

Maybe some other time, Mr. Neff. I

had a tough day.

NEFF

Just as you say, Mr. Dietrichson.

DIETRICHSON

Suppose we just settle that automobile

insurance tonight.

NEFF

Sure. All we need on that is for you

to sign an application for renewal.

LOLA

Phyllis, do you mind if we don't

finish this game? It bores me stiff.

PHYLLIS

Got some thing better to do?

LOLA

Yes, I have.

LOLA

(To Dietrichson)

Father, is it all right if I run

along now?

DIETRICHSON

Run along where? Who with?

LOLA

Just Anne. We're going roller skating.

DIETRICHSON

Anne who?

LOLA

Anne Matthews.

PHYLLIS

It's not that Nino Zachetti again?

DIETRICHSON

It better not be that Zachetti guy.

If I ever catch you with that ---

LOLA

It's Anne Matthews, I told you. I

also told you we're going roller

skating. I'm meeting her at the corner

of Vermont and Franklin -- the north-

west corner, in case you're

interested. And I'm late already. I

hope that is all clear. Good night,

Father. Good night, Phyllis.

NEFF

Good night, Miss Dietrichson.

LOLA

Oh, I'm sorry. Good night, Mr. --

NEFF

Neff.

LOLA

Good night, Mr. Neff.

PHYLLIS

Now you're not going to take my car

again.

LOLA

No thanks. I'd rather be dead.

DIETRICHSON

A great little fighter for her weight.

NEFF

This is where you sign, Mr.

Dietrichson.

DIETRICHSON

Sign what?

NEFF

The applications for your auto

renewals. So you'll be protected

until the new policies are issued.

DIETRICHSON

When will that be?

NEFF

In about a week.

DIETRICHSON

Just so I'm covered when I drive up

North.

NEFF

San Francisco, Mr. Dietrichson?

DIETRICHSON

Palo Alto.

PHYLLIS

He was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff. And

he still goes to his class reunion

every year.

DIETRICHSON

What's wrong with that? Can't I have

a little fun even once a year?

NEFF

Great football school, Stanford. Did

you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?

DIETRICHSON

Left guard. Almost made the varsity,

too.

NEFF

On that bottom line, Mr. Dietrichson.

NEFF

Both copies, please.

DIETRICHSON

Sign twice, huh?

NEFF

One is the agent's copy. I need it

for my files.

DIETRICHSON

(In a mutter)

Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

NEFF

No hurry about the check, Mr.

Dietrichson. I can pick it up at

your office some morning.

DIETRICHSON

How much you taking me for?

NEFF

One forty-seven fifty, Mr.

Dietrichson.

PHYLLIS

I guess that's enough insurance for

one evening, Mr. Neff.

DIETRICHSON

Plenty.

DIETRICHSON

Good night, Mr. Neff.

NEFF

Good night, Mr. Dietrichson. Good

night, Mrs. Dietrichson.

DIETRICHSON

Bring me some soda when you come up,

Phyllis.

PHYLLIS

(To Neff)

I think you left your hat in the

hall.

PHYLLIS

All right, Walter?

NEFF

Fine.

PHYLLIS

He signed it, didn't he?

NEFF

Sure he signed it. You saw him.

NEFF

(Looking up)

Watch it, will you.

NEFF

Listen. That trip to Palo Alto When

does he go?

PHYLLIS

End of the month.

NEFF

He drives, huh?

PHYLLIS

He always drives.

NEFF

Not this time. You're going to make

him take the train.

PHYLLIS

Why?

NEFF

Because it's all worked out for a

train.

PHYLLIS

It's all right. Go on, Walter.

NEFF

Look, baby. There's a clause in every

accident policy, a little something

called double indemnity. The insurance

companies put it in as a sort of

come-on for the customers. It means

they pay double on certain accidents.

The kind that almost never happen.

Like for instance if a guy got killed

on a train, they'd pay a hundred

thousand instead of fifty.

PHYLLIS

I see.

(Her eyes widen with

excitement)

NEFF

We're hitting it for the limit, baby.

That's why it's got to be a train.

PHYLLIS

It's going to be a train, Walter.

Just the way you say. Straight down

the line.

LOLA

Hello, Mr. Neff. It's me.

NEFF

Something the matter?

LOLA

I've been waiting for you.

NEFF

For me? What for?

LOLA

I thought you could let me ride with

you, if you're going my way.

NEFF

Which way would that be?

LOLA

Down the hill. Down Vermont.

NEFF

(Remembering)

Oh, sure. Vermont and Franklin. North-

west corner, wasn't it? Be glad to,

Miss Dietrichson.

NEFF

Roller skating, eh? You like roller

skating?

LOLA

I can take it or leave it.

NEFF

Only tonight you're leaving it?

LOLA

Yes, I am. You see, Mr. Neff, I'm

having a very tough time at home. My

father doesn't understand me and

Phyllis hates me.

NEFF

That does sound tough, all right.

LOLA

That's why I have to lie sometimes.

NEFF

You mean it's not Vermont and

Franklin.

LOLA

It's Vermont and Franklin all right.

Only it's not Anne Matthews. It's

Nino Zachetti. You won't tell on me,

will you?

NEFF

I'd have to think it over.

LOLA

Nino's not what my father says at

all. He just had bad luck. He was

doing pre-med at U.S.C. and working

nights as an usher in a theater

downtown. He got behind in his credits

and flunked out. Then he lost his

job for talking back. He's so hot-

headed.

NEFF

That comes expensive, doesn't it?

LOLA

I guess my father thinks nobody's

good enough for his daughter except

maybe the guy that owns Standard

Oil. Would you like a stick of gum?

NEFF

Never use it, thanks.

LOLA

I can't give Nino up. I wish father

could see it my way.

NEFF

It'll straighten out all right, Miss

Dietrichson.

LOLA

I suppose it will sometime.

(Looking out)

This is the corner right here, Mr.

Neff.

LOLA

There he is. By the bus stop.

LOLA

He needs a hair-cut, doesn't he.

Look at him. No job, no car, no money,

no prospects, no nothing.

(Pause)

I love him.

LOLA

(Calling)

Nino!

LOLA'S VOICE

Over here, Nino.

LOLA

This is Mr. Neff, Nino.

NEFF

Hello, Nino.

ZACHETTI

(Belligerent from the

first word)

The name is Zachetti.

LOLA

Nino. Please. Mr. Neff gave me a

ride from the house. I told him all

about us.

ZACHETTI

Why does he have to get told about

us?

LOLA

We don't have to worry about Mr.

Neff, Nino.

ZACHETTI

I'm not doing any worrying. Just

don't you broadcast so much.

LOLA

What's the matter with you, Nino?

He's a friend.

ZACHETTI

I don't have any friends. And if I

did, I like to pick them myself.

NEFF

Look, sonny, she needed the ride and

I brought her along. Is that anything

to get tough about?

ZACHETTI

All right, Lola, make up your mind.

Are you coming or aren't you?

LOLA

Of course I'm coming. Don't mind

him, Mr. Neff.

LOLA

Thanks a lot. You've been very sweet.

NEFF'S VOICE

She was a nice kid and maybe he was

a little better than he sounded. I

kind of hoped so for her sake, but

right then it gave me a nasty feeling

to be thinking about them at all,

with that briefcase right behind my

head and her father's application in

it. Besides, I had other problems to

work out. There were plans to make,

and Phyllis had to be in on them...

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

(Continued)

...but we couldn't be seen together

any more and I had told her never to

call me from her house and never to

call me at my office. So we had picked

out a big market on Los Feliz. She

was to be there buying stuff every

day about eleven o'clock, and I could

run into her there. Kind of

accidentally on purpose.

PHYLLIS

Walter.

NEFF

Not so loud.

PHYLLIS

I wanted to talk to you, Walter.

Ever since yesterday.

NEFF

Let me talk first. It's all set. The

accident policy came through. I've

got it in my pocket. I got his check

too. I saw him down in the oil fields.

He thought he was paying for the

auto insurance. The check's just

made out to the company. It could be

for anything. But you have to send a

check for the auto insurance, see.

It's all right that way, because one

of the cars is yours.

PHYLLIS

But listen, Walter ---

NEFF

Quick, open your bag.

NEFF

Can you get into his safe deposit

box?

PHYLLIS

Yes. We both have keys.

NEFF

Fine. But don't put the policy in

there yet. I'll tell you when. And

listen, you never touched it or even

saw it, understand?

PHYLLIS

I'm not a fool.

NEFF

Okay. When is he taking the train?

PHYLLIS

Walter, that's just it. He isn't

going.

NEFF

What?

PHYLLIS

That's what I've been trying to tell

you. The trip is off.

NEFF

What's happened?

WOMAN

(To Neff)

Mister, could you reach me that can

of coffee?

(She points)

That one up there.

NEFF

(Reaching up)

This one?

WOMAN

I don't see why they always have to

put what I want on the top shelf.

NEFF

Go ahead. I'm listening.

PHYLLIS

He had a fall down at the well. He

broke his leg. It's in a cast.

NEFF

That knocks it on the head all right.

PHYLLIS

What do we do, Walter?

NEFF

Nothing. Just wait.

PHYLLIS

Wait for what?

NEFF

Until he can take a train. I told

you it's got to be a train.

PHYLLIS

We can't wait. I can't go on like

this.

NEFF

We're not going to grab a hammer and

do it quick, just to get it over

with.

PHYLLIS

There are other ways.

NEFF

Only we're not going to do it other

ways.

PHYLLIS

But we can't leave it like this.

What do you think would happen if he

found out about this accident policy?

NEFF

Plenty. But not as bad as sitting in

that death-house.

PHYLLIS

Don't ever talk like that, Walter.

NEFF

Just don't let's start losing our

heads.

PHYLLIS

It's not our heads. It's our nerve

we're losing.

NEFF

We're going to do it right. That's

all I said.

PHYLLIS

Walter maybe it's my nerves. It's

the waiting that gets me.

NEFF

It's getting me just as bad, baby.

But we've got to wait.

PHYLLIS

Maybe we have, Walter. Only it's so

tough without you. It's like a wall

between us.

NEFF

Good-bye baby. I'm thinking of you

every minute.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

After that a full week went by and I

didn't see her once. I tried to keep

my mind off her and off the whole

idea. I kept telling myself that

maybe those fates they say watch

over you had gotten together and

broken his leg to give me a way out.

Then it was the fifteenth of June.

You may remember that date, Keyes. I

do too, only for a very different

reason. You came into my office around

three in the afternoon...

NEFF

Hello, Keyes.

KEYES

I just came from Norton's office.

The semi-annual sales records are

out. You're high man, Walter. That's

twice in a row. Congratulations.

NEFF

Thanks. How would you like a cheap

drink?

KEYES

How would you like a fifty dollar

cut in salary?

NEFF

How would I -- Do I laugh now, or

wait until it gets funny?

KEYES

I'm serious, Walter. I've been talking

to Norton. There's too much stuff

piling up on my desk. Too much

pressure on my nerves. I spend half

the night walking up and down in my

bed. I've got to have an assistant.

I thought that you --

NEFF

Me? Why pick on me?

KEYES

Because I've got a crazy idea you

might be good at the job.

NEFF

That's crazy all right. I'm a

salesman.

KEYES

Yeah. A peddler, a glad-hander, a

back-slapper. You're too good to be

a salesman.

NEFF

Nobody's too good to be a salesman.

KEYES

Phooey. All you guys do is ring door-

bells and dish out a smooth line of

monkey talk. What's bothering you is

that fifty buck cut, isn't it?

NEFF

That'd bother anybody.

KEYES

Look, Walter. The job I'm talking

about takes brains and integrity. It

takes more guts than there is in

fifty salesman. It's the hottest job

in the business.

NEFF

It's still a desk job. I don't want

a desk job.

KEYES

A desk job. Is that all you can see

in it? Just a hard chair to park

your pants on from nine to five.

Just a pile of papers to shuffle

around, and five sharp pencils and a

scratch pad to make figures on, with

maybe a little doodling on the side.

That's not the way I see it, Walter.

To me a claims man is a surgeon, and

that desk is an operating table, and

those pencils are scalpels and bone

chisels. And those papers are not

just forms and statistics and claims

for compensation. They're alive,

they're packed with drama, with

twisted hopes and crooked dreams. A

claims man, Walter, is a doctor and

a blood-hound and a cop and a judge

and a jury and a father confessor,

all in one.

KEYES

Who? Okay, hold the line.

KEYES

And you want to tell me you're not

interested. You don't want to work

with your brains. All you want to

work with is your finger on a door-

bell. For a few bucks more a week.

There's a dame on your phone.

NEFF

Walter Neff speaking.

PHYLLIS

I had to call you, Walter. It's

terribly urgent. Are you with

somebody?

NEFF

Of course I am. Can't I call you

back... Margie?

PHYLLIS

Walter, I've only got a minute. It

can't wait. Listen. He's going

tonight. On the train. Are you

listening, Walter? Walter!

NEFF

I'm listening. Only make it short...

Margie.

PHYLLIS

He's on crutches. The doctor says he

can go if he's careful. The change

will do him good. It's wonderful,

Walter. Just the way you wanted it.

Only with the crutches it's ever so

much better, isn't it?

NEFF

One hundred percent better. Hold the

line a minute.

NEFF

Suppose I join you in your office,

Keyes --

KEYES

I'll wait. Only tell Margie not to

take all day.

NEFF

Go ahead.

PHYLLIS

It's the ten-fifteen from Glendale.

I'm driving him. Is it still that

same dark street?

NEFF

Yeah -- sure.

PHYLLIS

The signal is three honks on the

horn. Is there anything else?

NEFF

What color did you pick out?

PHYLLIS

Color?

(She catches on)

Oh, sure. The blue suit, Walter.

Navy blue. And the cast on his left

leg.

NEFF

Navy blue. I like that fine.

PHYLLIS

This is it, Walter. I'm shaking like

a leaf. But it's straight down the

line now for both of us. I love you,

Walter. Goodbye.

NEFF

So long, Margie.

NEFF

I'm sorry, Keyes.

KEYES

What's the matter? The dames chasing

you again? Or still? Or is it none

of my business?

NEFF

(With a sour smile)

If I told you it was a customer --

KEYES

Margie! I bet she drinks from the

bottle. Why don't you settle down

and get married, Walter?

NEFF

Why don't you, for instance?

KEYES

I almost did, once. A long time ago.

NEFF

Look, Keyes, I've got a prospect to

call on.

KEYES

We even had the church all picked

out, the dame and I. She had a white

satin dress with flounces on it. And

I was on my way to the jewelry store

to buy the ring. Then suddenly that

little man in here started working

on me.

NEFF

So you went back and started

investigating her. That it?

KEYES

And the stuff that came out. She'd

been dyeing her hair ever since she

was sixteen. And there was a manic-

depressive in her family, on her

mother's side. And she already had

one husband, a professional pool

player in Baltimore. And as for her

brother --

NEFF

I get the general idea. She was a

tramp from a long line of tramps.

KEYES

All right, I'm going. What am I to

say to Norton? How about that job I

want you for?

NEFF

I don't think I want it. Thanks,

Keyes, just the same.

KEYES

Fair enough. Just get this: I picked

you for the job, not because I think

you're so darn smart, but because I

thought maybe you were a shade less

dumb than the rest of the outfit. I

guess I was all wet. You're not

smarter, Walter. You're just a little

taller.

NEFF'S VOICE

That was it, Keyes, and there was no

use kidding myself any more. Those

fates I was talking about had only

been stalling me off. Now they had

thrown the switch. The gears had

meshed. The machinery had started to

move and nothing could stop it. The

time for thinking had all run out.

From here on it was a question of

following the time table, move by

move, just as we had it rehearsed. I

wanted my time all accounted for for

the rest of the afternoon and up to

the last possible moment in the

evening. So I arranged to call on a

prospect in Pasadena about a public

liability bond. When I left the office

I put my rate book on the desk as if

I had forgotten it. That was part of

the alibi.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

I got home about seven and drove

right into the garage. This was

another item to establish my alibi.

ATTENDANT

Hiya there, Mr. Neff.

NEFF

How about a wash job on my heap,

Charlie?

ATTENDANT

How soon you want it, Mr. Neff? I

got two cars ahead of you.

NEFF

Anytime you get to it, Charlie. I'm

staying in tonight.

ATTENDANT

Okay, Mr. Neff. Be all shined up for

you in the morning.

NEFF

That left front tire looks a little

soft. Check it, will you?

ATTENDANT

You bet. Check 'em all round. Always

do.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE:

NEFF'S VOICE

Up in my apartment I called Lou

Schwartz, one of the salesmen that

shared my office. He lived in

Westwood. That made it a toll call

and there'd be a record of it. I

told him I had forgotten my rate

book and needed some dope on the

public liability bond I was figuring.

I asked him to call me back. This

was another item in my alibi, so

that later on I could prove that I

had been home.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

I changed into a navy blue suit like

Dietrichson was going to wear. Lou

Schwartz called me back and gave me

a lot of figures...

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

(Cont'd)

I stuffed a hand towel and a big

roll of adhesive tape into my pockets,

so I could fake something that looked

like a cast on a broken leg... Next

I fixed the telephone and the

doorbell, so that the cards would

fall down if the bells rang. That

way I would know there had been a

phone call or visitor while I was

away. I left the apartment house by

the fire stairs and side door. Nobody

saw me. It was already getting dark.

I took the Vermont Avenue bus to Los

Feliz and walked from there up to

the Dietrichson house. There was

that smell of honeysuckle again,

only stronger, now that it was

evening.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

Then I was in the garage. His car

was backed in, just the way I told

Phyllis to have it. It was so still

I could hear the ticking of the clock

on the dashboard. I kept thinking of

the place we had picked out to do

it, that dark street on the way to

the station, and the three honks on

the horn that were to be the signal...

About ten minutes later they came

down.

DISSOLVE TO:

PHYLLIS

You all right, honey? I'll have the

car out in a second.

PHYLLIS

Take it easy, honey. We've got lots

of time.

DIETRICHSON

Just let me do it my own way. Grab

that crutch.

DIETRICHSON

They ought to make these things so

they fold up.

DISSOLVE TO:

DIETRICHSON

Aw, stop squawkin' can't you, Phyllis?

No man takes his wife along to a

class reunion. That's what class

reunions are for.

PHYLLIS

Mrs. Tucker went along with her

husband last year, didn't she.

DIETRICHSON

Yeah, and what happened to her? She

sat in the hotel lobby for four days

straight. Never even saw the guy

until we poured him back on the train.

PHYLLIS' VOICE

All right, honey. Just so long as

you have a good time.

DIETRICHSON'S VOICE

I won't do much dancing, I can tell

you that.

PHYLLIS

Remember what the doctor said. If

you get careless you might end up

with a shorter leg.

DIETRICHSON

So what? I could break the other one

and match them up again.

PHYLLIS

It makes you feel pretty good to get

away from me, doesn't it?

DIETRICHSON

It's only for four days. I'll be

back Monday at the latest.

PHYLLIS

Don't forget we're having the Hobeys

for dinner on Monday.

DIETRICHSON

The Hobeys? We had them last. They

owe us a dinner, don't they?

PHYLLIS

Maybe they do but I've already asked

them for Monday.

DIETRICHSON

Well, I don't want to feed the Hobeys.

DIETRICHSON'S VOICE

And I don't want to eat at their

house either. The food you get there,

and that rope he hands out for cigars.

Call it off, can't you?

DIETRICHSON'S VOICE

What are you doing that for? What

the --

DISSOLVE TO:

MAN

(In a subdued voice)

You handle the redcap and the

conductor.

PHYLLIS

Don't worry.

MAN

Keep them away from me as much as

you can. I don't want to be helped.

PHYLLIS

I said don't worry, Walter.

NEFF

You start just as soon as the train

leaves. At the dairy sign you turn

off the highway onto the dirt road.

From there it's exactly eight-tenths

of a mile to the dump beside the

tracks. Remember?

PHYLLIS

I remember everything.

NEFF

You'll be there a little ahead of

the train. No speeding. You don't

want any cops stopping you -- with

him in the back.

PHYLLIS

Walter, we've been through all that

so many times.

NEFF

When you turn off the highway, cut

all your lights. I'm going to be

back on the observation platform.

I'll drop off as close to the spot

as I can. Wait for the train to pass,

then blink your lights twice.

REDCAP

San Francisco train, lady?

PHYLLIS

Car nine, section eleven. Just my

husband going.

REDCAP

Car nine, section eleven. Yessum,

this way please.

PHYLLIS

It's all right, thanks. My husband

doesn't like to be helped.

CONDUCTOR

Car nine, section eleven. The

gentleman only. Thank you.

PHYLLIS

Goodbye, honey. Take awful good care

of yourself with that leg.

NEFF

Sure, I will. Just you take it easy

going home.

PHYLLIS

I'll miss you, honey.

REDCAP

Section eleven, suh.

PORTER

(Shouting)

All aboard!

PHYLLIS

Good luck, honey.

NEFF

Can you make up my berth right away?

PORTER

Yes, sir.

NEFF

I'm going back to the observation

car for a smoke.

PORTER

This way, sir. Three cars back.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MAN'S VOICE

Can I pull a chair out for you?

NEFF

No thanks, I'd rather stand.

MAN

You going far?

NEFF

Palo Alto.

MAN

My name's Jackson. I'm going all the

way to Medford. Medford, Oregon. Had

a broken arm myself once.

NEFF

Uh-huh.

JACKSON

That darn cast sure itches something

fierce, don't it? I thought I'd go

crazy with mine.

JACKSON

Palo Alto's a nice little town. You

a Stanford man?

NEFF

Used to be.

JACKSON

I bet you left something behind. I

always do.

NEFF

My cigar case. Must have left it in

my overcoat back in the section.

JACKSON

Care to roll yourself a cigarette,

Mr. --?

NEFF

Dietrichson. Thanks. I really prefer

cigars.

(Looking around)

Maybe the porter --

JACKSON

I could get your cigars for you. Be

glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.

NEFF

That's darn nice of you. It's car

nine, section eleven. If you're sure

it's not too much trouble.

JACKSON

Car nine, section eleven. A pleasure.

NEFF

Okay. This has to go fast. Take his

hat and pick up the crutches.

NEFF

Hang on to that rug. I'll need it.

NEFF

Let's go. Stay behind me.

NEFF

Get in. You drive.

NEFF

Let's go, baby.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

On the way back we went over once

more what she was to do at the

inquest, if they had one, and about

the insurance, when that came up. I

was afraid she might go to pieces a

little, now that we had done it, but

she was perfect. No nerves. Not a

tear, not even a blink of the eyes...

NEFF'S VOICE

(Cont'd)

She dropped me a block from my

apartment house.

PHYLLIS

Walter.

PHYLLIS

What's the matter, Walter. Aren't

you going to kiss me?

NEFF

Sure, I'm going to kiss you.

PHYLLIS

It's straight down the line, isn't

it?

PHYLLIS

I love you, Walter.

NEFF

I love you, baby.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

It was two minutes past eleven as I

went up the fire stairs again. Nobody

saw me this time either.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

(Cont'd)

In the apartment I checked the bells.

The cards hadn't moved. No calls. No

visitors.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

I changed the blue suit. There was

one last thing to do. I wanted the

garage man to see me again.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE

You going to need it after all, Mr.

Neff? I'm about through.

NEFF

It's okay, Charlie. Just walking

down to the drug store for something

to eat. Been working upstairs all

evening. My stomach's getting sore

at me.

NEFF'S VOICE

That was all there was to it. Nothing

had slipped, nothing had been

overlooked, there was nothing to

give us away. And yet, Keyes, as I

was walking down the street to the

drug store, suddenly it came over me

that everything would go wrong. It

sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true,

so help me: I couldn't hear my own

footsteps. It was the walk of a dead

man.

FADE OUT:

END OF SEQUENCE "B"

SEQUENCE "C"

COLORED MAN

Didn't know anybody was here, Mr.

Neff. We ain't cleaned your office

yet.

NEFF

Let it go tonight. I'm busy.

COLORED MAN

Whatever you say, Mr. Neff.

NEFF

That was the longest night I ever

lived through, Keyes, and the next

day was worse, when the story broke

in the papers, and they were talking

about it at the office, and the day

after that when you started digging

into it. I kept my hands in my pockets

because I thought they were shaking,

and I put on dark glasses so people

couldn't see my eyes, and then I

took them off again so people wouldn't

get to wondering why I wore them. I

was trying to hold myself together,

but I could feel my nerves pulling

me to pieces....

DISSOLVE TO:

KEYES

Come on, Walter. The big boss wants

to see us.

NEFF

Okay.

NEFF

That Dietrichson case?

KEYES

Must be.

NEFF

Anything wrong?

KEYES

The guy's dead, we had him insured

and it's going to cost us money.

That's always wrong.

NEFF

What have you got so far?

KEYES

Autopsy report. No heart failure, no

apoplexy, no predisposing medical

cause of any kind. He died of a broken

neck.

NEFF

When is the inquest?

KEYES

They had it this morning. His wife

and daughter made the identification.

The train people and some passengers

told how he went through to the

observation car.. It was all over in

forty-five minutes. Verdict,

accidental death.

NEFF

What do the police figure?

KEYES

That he got tangled up in his crutches

and fell off the train. They're

satisfied. It's not their dough.

NORTON

(To the men who are

leaving)

I believe the legal position is now

clear, gentlemen. Please stand by. I

may need you later.

NORTON

Come in, Mr. Keyes. You too, Mr.

Neff.

NORTON

You find this an uncomfortably warm

day Mr. Keyes?

KEYES

Sorry, Mr. Norton. I didn't know

this was formal.

NORTON

Sit down, gentlemen.

(To Keyes)

Any new developments?

KEYES

I just talked to this Jackson long

distance. Up in Medford, Oregon.

NORTON

Who's Jackson?

KEYES

The last guy that saw Dietrichson

alive. They were out on the

observation platform together talking.

Dietrichson wanted a cigar and Jackson

went to get Dietrichson's cigar case

for him. When he came back to the

observation platform, no Dietrichson.

Jackson didn't think anything was

wrong until a wire caught up with

the train at Santa Barbara. They had

found Dietrichson's body on the tracks

near Burbank.

NORTON

Very interesting, about the cigar

case.

NORTON

Anything else?

KEYES

Not much. Dietrichson's secretary

says she didn't know anything about

the policy. There is a daughter, but

all she remembers is Neff talking to

her father about accident insurance

at their house one night.

NEFF

I couldn't sell him at first. Mrs.

Dietrichson opposed it. He told me

he'd think it over. Later on I went

down to the oil fields and closed

him. He signed the application and

gave me his check.

NORTON

(Dripping with sarcasm)

A fine piece of salesmanship that

was, Mr. Neff.

KEYES

There's no sense in pushing Neff

around. He's got the best sales record

in the office. Are your salesmen

supposed to know that the customer

is going to fall off a train?

NORTON

Fall off a train? Are we sure

Dietrichson fell off the train?

KEYES

I don't get it.

NORTON

You don't, Mr. Keyes? Then what do

you think of this case? This policy

might cost us a great deal of money.

As you know, it contains a double

indemnity clause. Just what is your

opinion?

KEYES

No opinion at all.

NORTON

Not even a hunch? One of those

interesting little hunches of yours?

KEYES

Nope. Not even a hunch.

NORTON

I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've formed

a very definite opinion. I think I

know -- in fact I know I know what

happened to Dietrichson.

KEYES

You know you know what?

NORTON

I know it was not an accident.

NORTON

What do you say to that?

KEYES

Me? You've got the ball. Let's see

you run with it.

NORTON

There's a widespread feeling that

just because a man has a large office --

NORTON

(Into dictograph)

Yes?... Have her come in, please.

NORTON

-- that just because a man has a

large office he must be an idiot.

I'm having a visitor, if you don't

mind.

NORTON

No, no. I want you to stay and watch

me handle this.

SECRETARY

Mrs. Dietrichson.

NORTON

Thank you very much for coming, Mrs.

Dietrichson. I assure you I appreciate

it.

NORTON

This is Mr. Keyes.

KEYES

How do you do.

PHYLLIS

How do you do.

NORTON

And Mr. Neff.

PHYLLIS

I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do.

NORTON

Mrs. Dietrichson, I assure you of

our sympathy in your bereavement. I

hesitated before asking you to come

here so soon after your loss.

NORTON

But now that you're here I hope you

won't mind if I plunge straight into

business. You know why we asked you

to come, don't you?

PHYLLIS

No. All I know is that your secretary

made it sound very urgent.

NORTON

Your husband had an accident policy

with this company. Evidently you

don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson.

PHYLLIS

No. I remember some talk at the house --

PHYLLIS

-- but he didn't seem to want it.

NEFF

He took it out a few days later,

Mrs. Dietrichson.

PHYLLIS

I see.

NORTON

You'll probably find the policy among

his personal effects.

PHYLLIS

His safe deposit box hasn't been

opened yet. It seems a tax examiner

has to be present.

NORTON

Please, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't

want you to think you are being

subjected to any questioning. But

there are a few things we should

like to know.

PHYLLIS

What sort of things?

NORTON

We have the report of the coroner's

inquest. Accidental death. We are

not entirely satisfied. In fact we

are not satisfied at all.

NORTON

Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect

suicide.

NORTON

I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of

water?

PHYLLIS

Please.

NORTON

Mr. Neff.

PHYLLIS

Thank you.

NORTON

Had your husband been moody or

depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

Did he seem to have financial worries,

for instance?

PHYLLIS

He was perfectly all right and I

don't know of any financial worries.

NORTON

There must have been something, Mrs.

Dietrichson. Let us examine this so-

called accident. First, your husband

takes out this policy in absolute

secrecy. Why? Because he doesn't

want his family to suspect what he

intends to do.

PHYLLIS

Do what?

NORTON

Commit suicide. Next, he goes on

this trip entirely alone. He has to

be alone. He hobbles all the way out

to the observation platform, very

unlikely with his leg in a cast,

unless he has a very strong reason.

Once there, he finds he is not alone.

There is a man there. What was his

name, Keyes?

KEYES

His name was Jackson. Probably still

is.

NORTON

Jackson. So your husband gets rid of

this Jackson with some flimsy excuse

about cigars. And then he is alone.

And then he does it. He jumps.

Suicide. In which case the company

is not liable.

(Pause)

You know that, of course. We could

go to court --

PHYLLIS

I don't know anything. In fact I

don't know why I came here.

NORTON

Just a moment, please. I said we

could go to court. I didn't say we

want to. Not only is it against our

practice, but it would involve a

great deal of expense, a lot of

lawyers, a lot of time, perhaps years.

NORTON

So what I want to suggest is a

compromise on both sides. A settlement

for a certain sum, a part of the

policy value --

PHYLLIS

Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I

came in here I had no idea you owed

me any money. You told me you did.

Then you told me you didn't. Now you

tell me you want to pay me a part of

it, whatever it is. You want to

bargain with me, at a time like this.

I don't like your insinuations about

my husband, Mr. Norton, and I don't

like your methods. In fact I don't

like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye,

gentlemen.

KEYES

Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure

carried that ball.

KEYES

Only you fumbled on the goal line.

Then you heaved an illegal forward

pass and got thrown for a forty-yard

loss. Now you can't pick yourself up

because you haven't got a leg to

stand on.

NORTON

I haven't eh? Let her claim. Let her

sue. We can prove it was suicide.

KEYES

Can we? Mr. Norton, the first thing

that hit me was that suicide angle.

Only I dropped it in the wastepaper

basket just three seconds later. You

ought to take a look at the statistics

on suicide sometime. You might learn

a little something about the insurance

business.

NORTON

I was raised in the insurance

business, Mr. Keyes.

KEYES

Yeah. In the front office. Come on,

you never read an actuarial table in

your life. I've got ten volumes on

suicide alone. Suicide by race, by

color, by occupation, by sex, by

seasons of the year, by time of day.

Suicide, how committed: by poisons,

by fire-arms, by drowning, by leaps.

Suicide by poison, subdivided by

types of poison, such as corrosive,

irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic,

alkaloid, protein, and so forth.

Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps

from high places, under wheels of

trains, under wheels of trucks, under

the feet of horses, from steamboats.

But Mr. Norton, of all the cases on

record there's not one single case

of suicide by leap from the rear end

of a moving train. And do you know

how fast that train was going at the

point where the body was found?

Fifteen miles an hour. Now how could

anybody jump off a slow moving train

like that with any kind of expectation

that he would kill himself? No soap,

Mr. Norton. We're sunk, and we're

going to pay through the nose, and

you know it. May I have this?

KEYES

Come on, Walter.

KEYES

Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF

I could have hugged you right then

and there, Keyes, you and your

statistics. You were the only one we

were really scared of, and instead

you were almost playing on our team...

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

That evening when I got home my nerves

had eased off. I could feel the ground

under my feet again, and it looked

like easy going from there on it.

NEFF

Hello... Hello, baby.... Sure,

everything is fine... You were

wonderful in Norton's office.

PHYLLIS

I felt so funny. I wanted to look at

you all the time.

NEFF

How do you think I felt? Where are

you, baby?

PHYLLIS

At the drug store. Just a block away.

Can I come up?

NEFF

Okay. But be careful. Don't let

anybody see you.

NEFF

Hello, Keyes.

NEFF

What's on your mind?

KEYES

That broken leg. The guy broke his

leg.

NEFF

What are you talking about?

KEYES

Talking about Dietrichson. He had

accident insurance, didn't he? Then

he broke his leg, didn't he?

NEFF

So what?

KEYES

And he didn't put in a claim. Why

didn't he put in a claim? Why?

NEFF

What the dickens are you driving at?

KEYES

Walter. There's something wrong. I

ate dinner two hours ago. It stuck

half way.

KEYES

The little man is acting up again.

Because there's something wrong with

that Dietrichson case.

NEFF

Because he didn't put in a claim?

Maybe he just didn't have time.

KEYES

Oh maybe he just didn't know he was

insured.

KEYES

No. That couldn't be it. You delivered

the policy to him personally, didn't

you, Walter? And you got his check.

NEFF

(Stiff-lipped, but

his voice is as well

under control as he

can manage)

Sure, I did.

KEYES

Got any bicarbonate of soda?

NEFF

No I haven't.

KEYES

Listen, Walter. I've been living

with this little man for twenty-six

years. He's never failed me yet.

There's got to be something wrong.

NEFF

Maybe Norton was right. Maybe it was

suicide, Keyes.

KEYES

No. Not suicide.

(Pause)

But not accident either.

NEFF

What else?

KEYES

Look. A man takes out an accident

policy that is worth a hundred

thousand dollars if he is killed on

a train. Then, two weeks later, he

is killed on a train. And not in a

train accident, mind you, but falling

off some silly observation car. Do

you know what the mathematical

probability of that is, Walter? One

out of I don't know how many billions.

And add to that the broken leg. It

just can't be the way it looks,

Walter. Something has been worked on

us.

NEFF

Such as what?

NEFF

Murder?

KEYES

(Prods stomach again)

Don't you have any peppermint or

anything?

NEFF

I'm sorry.

(Pause)

Who do you suspect?

KEYES

Maybe I like to make things easy for

myself. But I always tend to suspect

the beneficiary.

NEFF

The wife?

KEYES

Yeah. That wide-eyed dame that didn't

know anything about anything.

NEFF

You're crazy, Keyes. She wasn't even

on the train.

KEYES

I know she wasn't, Walter. I don't

claim to know how it was worked, or

who worked it, but I know that it

was worked.

KEYES

I've got to get to a drug store. It

feels like a hunk of concrete inside

me.

KEYES

Good night, Walter.

NEFF

Good night, Keyes.

KEYES

See you at the office in the morning.

KEYES

But I'd like to move in on her right

now, tonight, if it wasn't for Norton

and his stripe-pants ideas about

company policy. I'd have the cops

after her so quick her head would

spin. They'd put her through the

wringer, and, brother, what they

would squeeze out.

NEFF

Only you haven't got a single thing

to go on, Keyes.

KEYES

Not too much. Twenty-six years

experience, all the percentage there

is, and this lump of concrete in my

stomach.

KEYES

(Almost angrily)

No bicarbonate of soda.

PHYLLIS

How much does he know?

NEFF

It's not what he knows. It's those

stinking hunches of his.

PHYLLIS

But he can't prove anything, can he?

NEFF

Not if we're careful. Not if we don't

see each other for a while.

PHYLLIS

For how long a while?

NEFF

Until all this dies down. You don't

know Keyes the way I do. Once he

gets his teeth into something he

won't let go. He'll investigate you.

He'll have you shadowed. He'll watch

you every minute from now on. Are

you afraid, baby?

PHYLLIS

Yes, I'm afraid. But not of Keyes.

I'm afraid of us. We're not the same

any more. We did it so we could be

together, but instead of that it's

pulling us apart. Isn't it, Walter?

NEFF

What are you talking about?

PHYLLIS

And you don't really care whether we

see each other or not.

NEFF

Shut up, baby.

FADE OUT:

END OF SEQUENCE "C"

SEQUENCE "D"

LOLA

Hello, Mr. Neff.

NEFF

Hello.

LOLA

Lola Dietrichson. Don't you remember

me?

NEFF

(On his guard)

Yes. Of course.

LOLA

Could I talk to you, just for a few

minutes? Somewhere where we can be

alone?

NEFF

Sure. Come on into my office.

NEFF

Is it something to do with -- what

happened?

LOLA

Yes, Mr. Neff. It's about my father's

death.

NEFF

I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.

NEFF

(To Schwartz)

Lou, do you mind if I use the office

alone for a few minutes?

SCHWARTZ

It's all yours, Walter.

NEFF

Won't you sit down?

LOLA

Mr. Neff, I can't help it, but I

have such a strange feeling that

there is something queer about my

father's death.

NEFF

Queer? Queer in what way?

LOLA

I don't know why I should be bothering

you with my troubles, except that

you knew my father and knew about

the insurance he took out. And you

were so nice to me that evening in

your car.

NEFF

Sure. We got along fine, didn't we.

LOLA

Look at me, Mr. Neff. I'm not crazy.

I'm not hysterical. I'm not even

crying. But I have the awful feeling

that something is wrong, and I had

the same feeling once before -- when

my mother died.

NEFF

When your mother died?

LOLA

We were up at Lake Arrowhead. That

was six years ago. We had a cabin

there. It was winter and very cold

and my mother was very sick with

pneumonia. She had a nurse with her.

There were just the three of us in

the cabin. One night I got up and

went into my mother's room. She was

delirious with fever. All the bed

covers were on the floor and the

windows were wide open. The nurse

wasn't in the room. I ran and covered

my mother up as quickly as I could.

Just then I heard a door open behind

me. The nurse stood there. She didn't

say a word, but there was a look in

her eyes I'll never forget. Two days

later my mother was dead.

(Pause)

Do you know who that nurse was?

NEFF

No. Who?

LOLA

Phyllis. I tried to tell my father,

but I was just a kid then and he

wouldn't listen to me. Six months

later she married him and I kind of

talked myself out of the idea that

she could have done anything like

that. But now it's all back again,

now that something has happened to

my father, too.

NEFF

You're not making sense, Miss

Dietrichson. Your father fell off a

train.

LOLA

Yes, and two days before he fell off

that train what was Phyllis doing?

She was in her room in front of a

mirror, with a black hat on, and she

was pinning a black veil to it, as

if she couldn't wait to see how she

would look in mourning.

NEFF

Look. You've had a pretty bad shock.

Aren't you just imagining all this?

LOLA

I caught her eyes in the mirror, and

they had that look in them they had

before my mother died. That same

look.

NEFF

You don't like your step-mother, do

you? Isn't it just because she is

your step-mother?

LOLA

I loathe her. Because she did it.

She did it for the money. Only you're

not going to pay her, are you, Mr.

Neff? She's not going to get away

with it this time. I'm going to speak

up. I'm going to tell everything I

know.

NEFF

You'd better be careful, saying things

like that.

LOLA

I'm not afraid. You'll see.

LOLA

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to act like

this.

NEFF

All this that you've been telling me --

who else have you told?

LOLA

No one.

NEFF

How about your step-mother?

LOLA

Of course not. I'm not living in the

house any more. I moved out.

NEFF

And you didn't tell that boy-friend

of yours? Zachetti.

LOLA

I'm not seeing him any more. We had

a fight.

NEFF

Where are you living then?

LOLA

I got myself a little apartment in

Hollywood.

NEFF

Four walls, and you just sit and

look at them, huh?

LOLA

(Through her tears)

Yes, Mr. Neff.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

So I took her to dinner that evening

at a Mexican joint down on Olvera

Street where nobody would see us. I

wanted to cheer her up..

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

Next day was Sunday and we went for

a ride down to the beach. She had

loosened up a bit and she was even

laughing... I had to make sure she

wouldn't tell that stuff about Phyllis

to anybody else. It was dynamite,

whether it was true or not. And I

had no chance to talk to Phyllis.

You were watching her like a hawk,

Keyes. I couldn't even phone her for

fear you had the wires tapped.

NEFF'S VOICE

Monday morning there was a note on

my desk that you wanted to see me,

Keyes. For a minute I wondered if it

could be about Lola. It was worse.

Outside your door was the last guy

in the world I wanted to see.

KEYES

Come in. Come in, Walter. I want to

ask you something. After all the

years we've known each other, do you

mind if I make a rather blunt

statement?

NEFF

About what?

KEYES

About me. Walter, I'm a very great

man. This Dietrichson business. It's

murder, and murders don't come any

neater. As fancy a piece of homicide

as anybody ever ran into. Smart and

tricky and almost perfect, but --

KEYES

but, I think Papa has it all figured

out, figured out and wrapped up in

tissue paper with pink ribbons on

it.

NEFF

I'm listening.

KEYES

You know what? That guy Dietrichson

was never on the train.

NEFF

He wasn't?

KEYES

No, he wasn't, Walter. Look, you

can't be sure of killing a man by

throwing him off a train that's going

fifteen miles an hour. The only way

you can be sure is to kill him first

and then throw his body on the tracks.

That would mean either killing him

on the train, or -- and this is where

it really gets fancy -- you kill him

somewhere else and put him on the

tracks. Two possibilities, and I

personally buy the second.

NEFF

You're way ahead of me, Keyes.

KEYES

Look, it was like this. They killed

the guy -- the wife and somebody

else -- and then the somebody else

took the crutches and went on the

train as Dietrichson, and then the

somebody else jumped off, and then

they put the body on the tracks where

the train had passed. An

impersonation, see. And a cinch to

work. Because it was night, very few

people were about, they had the

crutches to stare at, and they never

really looked at the man at all.

NEFF

It's fancy all right, Keyes. Maybe

it's a little too fancy.

KEYES

Is it? I tell you it fits together

like a watch. And now let's see what

we have in the way of proof. The

only guy that really got a good look

at this supposed Dietrichson is

sitting right outside my office. I

took the trouble to bring him down

here from Oregon. Let's see what he

has to say.

KEYES

Come in, Mr. Jackson.

JACKSON

Yes sir, Mr. Keyes. These are fine

cigars you smoke.

KEYES

Two for a quarter.

JACKSON

That's what I said.

KEYES

Never mind the cigar, Jackson. Did

you study those photographs? What do

you say?

JACKSON

Yes, indeed, I studied them

thoroughly. Very thoroughly

KEYES

Well? Did you make up your mind?

JACKSON

Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man. Medford,

Oregon. Up in Medford we take our

time making up our minds --

KEYES

Well you're not in Medford now. I'm

in a hurry. Let's have it.

JACKSON

Are these photographs of the late

Mr. Dietrichson?

KEYES

Yes.

JACKSON

Then my answer is no.

KEYES

What do you mean no?

JACKSON

I mean this is not the man that was

on the train.

KEYES

Will you swear to that?

JACKSON

I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon.

And if I say it, I mean it, and if I

mean it, of course I'll swear it.

KEYES

Thank you.

KEYES

There you are, Walter. There's your

proof.

KEYES

Oh, Mr. Jackson, this is Mr. Neff,

one of our salesmen.

JACKSON

Please to meet you, Mr. Neff. Pleased

indeed.

NEFF

How do you do.

JACKSON

Very fine, thank you. Never was

better.

KEYES

Mr. Jackson, how would you describe

the man you saw on that observation

platform?

JACKSON

Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger

man, about ten or fifteen years

younger than the man in these

photographs.

KEYES

Dietrichson was about fifty, wasn't

he, Walter?

NEFF

Fifty-one, according to the policy.

JACKSON

The man I saw was nothing like fifty-

one years old. Of course, it was

pretty dark on that platform and,

come to think of it, he tried to

keep his back towards me. But I'm

positive just the same.

KEYES

That's fine, Jackson. Now you

understand this matter is strictly

confidential. We may need you again

down here in Los Angeles, if the

case comes to court.

JACKSON

Any time you need me, I'm at your

entire disposal, gentlemen. Expenses

paid, of course.

KEYES

Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office.

JACKSON

(To Neff)

Ever been in Medford, Mr. Neff?

NEFF

Never.

JACKSON

Wait a minute. Do you go trout

fishing? Maybe I saw you up Klamath

Falls way.

NEFF

Nope. Never fish.

JACKSON

Neff. Neff. I've got it! It's the

name. There's a family of Neffs in

Corvallis.

NEFF

No relation.

JACKSON

Let me see. This man's an automobile

dealer in Corvallis. Very reputable

man, too, I'm told.

KEYES

All right, Mr. Jackson. Suppose you

go down to the cashier's office --

room twenty-seven on the eleventh

floor. They'll take care of your

expense account and your ticket for

the train tonight.

JACKSON

Tonight? Tomorrow morning would suit

me better. There's a very good

osteopath down here I want to see

before I leave.

KEYES

Okay, Mr. Jackson. Just don't put

her on the expense account.

JACKSON

Goodbye, gentlemen. A pleasure.

KEYES

There it is, Walter. It's beginning

to come apart at the seams already.

A murder's never perfect. It always

comes apart sooner or later. And

when two people are involved it's

usually sooner. We know the

Dietrichson dame is in it, and

somebody else. Pretty soon we're

going to know who that somebody else

is. He'll show. He's got to show.

Sometime, somewhere, they've got to

meet. Their emotions are all kicked

up. Whether it's love or hate doesn't

matter. They can't keep away from

each other. They think it's twice as

safe because there are two of them.

But it's not twice as safe. It's ten

times twice as dangerous. They've

committed a murder and that's not

like taking a trolley ride together

where each one can get off at a

different stop. They're stuck with

each other. They've got to ride all

the way to the end of the line. And

it's a one-way trip, and the last

stop is the cemetery.

KEYES

(Continued)

She put in her claim and I'm going

to throw it right back at her.

(Pats his pockets

again)

Have you got one of those?

KEYES

Let her sue us if she dares. I'll be

ready for her -- and that somebody

else. They'll be digging their own

graves.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF

(Into phone)

Mrs. Dietrichson?... This is Jerry's

market. We just got in a shipment of

that English soap you were asking

about. Will you be coming by this

morning?... Thank you, Mrs.

Dietrichson.

DISSOLVE TO:

PHYLLIS

Hello, Walter.

NEFF

(In a harsh whisper)

Come closer.

PHYLLIS

What's the matter?

NEFF

Everything's the matter. Keyes is

rejecting your claim. He's sitting

back with his mouth watering, waiting

for you to sue. He wants you to sue.

But you're not going to.

PHYLLIS

What's he got to stop me?

NEFF

He's got the goods. He's figured out

how it was worked. He knows it was

somebody else on the train. He's dug

up a witness he thinks will prove

it.

PHYLLIS

Prove it how? Listen, if he rejects

that claim, I have to sue.

NEFF

Yeah? And then you're in court and a

lot of other things are going to

come up. Like, for instance, about

you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

PHYLLIS

What about me and the first Mrs.

Dietrichson?

NEFF

The way she died. And about that

black hat you were trying on -- before

you needed a black hat.

PHYLLIS

Walter, Lola's been telling you some

of her cockeyed stories. She's been

seeing you.

NEFF

I've been seeing her, if you want to

know. So she won't yell her head off

about what she knows.

PHYLLIS

Yes, she's been putting on an act

for you, crying all over your

shoulder, that lying little --

NEFF

Keep her out of it. All I'm telling

you is we're not going to sue.

PHYLLIS

Because you don't want the money any

more, even if you could get it?

Because she's made you feel like a

heel all of sudden.

NEFF

It isn't the money any more. It's

our necks now. We're pulling out,

understand.

PHYLLIS

Because of what Keyes can do? You're

not fooling me, Walter. It's because

of Lola. What you did to her father.

You can't take it that she might

find out some day.

NEFF

I said, leave her out of it.

PHYLLIS

Walter, it's me I'm talking about. I

don't want to be left out of it.

NEFF

Stop saying that. It's just that it

hasn't worked out the way we wanted.

We can't have the money. We can't go

through with it, that's all.

PHYLLIS

We have gone through with it, Walter.

The tough part is all behind us. We

just have to hold on now and not go

soft inside, and stick together,

close, the way we started out.

NEFF

Watch it, will you. Someone's coming.

PHYLLIS

I loved you, Walter. And I hated

him. But I wasn't going to do anything

about it, not until I met you. It

was you had the plan. I only wanted

him dead.

NEFF

Yeah, and I was the one that fixed

him so he was dead. Is that what

you're telling me?

PHYLLIS

Yes. And nobody's pulling out. We

went into it together, and we're

coming out at the end together. It's

straight down the line for both of

us, remember.

NEFF'S VOICE

Yeah. I remembered all right. Just

as I remembered what you had told

me, Keyes, about that trolley car

ride and how there was no way to get

off -- until the end of the line.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF

Yeah, I remembered it all right.

Just as I remembered what you had

told me, Keyes, about that trolley

car ride, and how there was no way

to get off until the end of the line,

where the cemetery was. And I got to

thinking what cemeteries are for.

They're to put dead people in, I

guess that was the first time I ever

thought about Phyllis that way. Dead,

I mean, and how things would be if

she was dead. Because the way it was

now she had me by the throat. She

could hang me higher than a kite any

day she felt like it. And there was

nothing I could do, except hold my

breath and watch that day come closer

and closer, and maybe pray a little,

if I still knew how to pray... I saw

Lola three or four times that week.

I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, after

what I had done, but it was only

with her that I could relax and let

go a little. Then one night we drove

up into the hills above Hollywood

Bowl...

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF

Why are you crying?

NEFF

You won't tell me?

LOLA

(In a choked voice)

Of course I will, Walter. I wouldn't

tell anybody else but you. It's about

Nino.

NEFF

Zachetti? What about him?

LOLA

They killed my father together. He

and Phyllis. He helped her do it. I

know he did.

NEFF

What makes you say that?

LOLA

I've been following him. He's at her

house, night after night. It was

Phyllis and him all the time. Maybe

he was going with me just for a blind.

And the night of the murder --

NEFF

You promised not to talk that way

any more.

LOLA

-- he was supposed to pick me up

after a lecture at U.C.L.A. -- but

he never showed up. He said he was

sick. Sick! He couldn't show up,

because the train was leaving with

my father on it.

LOLA

Maybe I'm just crazy. Maybe it's all

just in my mind.

NEFF

Sure, it's all in your mind.

LOLA

I only wish it was, Walter, because

I still love him.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

Zachetti. That's funny. Phyllis and

Zachetti. What was he doing up at

her house? I couldn't figure that

one out I tried to make sense out of

it and got nowhere. But the real

brain-twister came the next day. You

sprang it on me, Keyes, after office

hours, when you caught me down in

the lobby of the building.

KEYES' VOICE

Oh, Walter, just a minute.

NEFF

Hello, Keyes.

KEYES

Hang onto your hat, Walter.

NEFF

What for?

KEYES

Nothing much. The Dietrichson case

just busted wide open.

NEFF

How do you mean?

KEYES

The guy showed. That's how.

NEFF

The somebody else?

KEYES

Yeah. The guy that did it with her.

NEFF

No kidding?

KEYES

She's filed suit against us, and

it's okay by me. When we get into

that courtroom I'll tear them apart,

both of them. Come on -- I'll buy

you a martini.

NEFF

No thanks, Keyes.

KEYES

With two olives.

NEFF

I've got to get a shave and a

shoeshine. I've got a date.

KEYES

Margie. I still bet she drinks from

the bottle.

NEFF

They give you matches when they sell

you cigars, Keyes. All you have to

do is ask for them.

KEYES

I don't like them. They always explode

in my pockets. So long, Walter.

NEFF'S VOICE

You sure had me worried, Keyes. I

didn't know if you were playing cat-

and-mouse with me, whether you knew

all along I was the somebody else.

That's what I had to find out, and I

thought I knew where to look...

NEFF

(To elevator operator)

Twelve.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

Upstairs, the last of the people

were just leaving.

NEFF'S VOICE

I made sure nobody saw me go into

your office.

KEYES' VOICE

(From Dictaphone)

Memo to Mr. Norton. Confidential.

Dietrichson File. With regard to

your proposal to put Walter Neff

under surveillance, I disagree

absolutely. I have investigated his

movements on the night of the crime,

and he is definitely placed in his

apartment from 7:15 P.M. on. In

addition to this, I have known Neff

intimately for eleven years, and I

personally vouch for him, without

reservation...

KEYES' VOICE

(From Dictaphone)

...Furthermore, no connection

whatsoever has been established

between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis

Dietrichson, whereas I am now able

to report that such a connection has

been established between her and

another man. This man has been

observed to visit the Dietrichson

home on the night of July 9th, 10th,

11th, 12th and 13th. We have succeeded

in identifying him as one Nino

Zachetti, former medical student,

aged twenty-eight, residing at Lilac

Court Apartments 122812 N. La Brea

Avenue. We have checked Zachetti's

movements on the night of the crime

and have found that they cannot be

accounted for. I am preparing a more

detailed report for your consideration

and it is my belief that we already

have sufficient evidence against

Zachetti and Mrs. Dietrichson to

justify police action. I strongly

urge that this whole matter be turned

over to the office of the District

Attorney. Respectfully, Barton Keyes.

NEFF

Phyllis? Walter. I've got to see

you... Tonight... Yes, it has to be

tonight... How's eleven o'clock?

Don't worry about Keyes. He's

satisfied... Leave the door on the

latch and put the lights out. No,

nobody's watching the house... I

told you Keyes is satisfied. It's

just for the neighbors... That's

what I said. Yeah. Eleven o'clock.

Goodbye, baby.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF'S VOICE

I guess I don't have to tell you

what I was going to do at eleven

o'clock, Keyes. For the first time I

saw a way to get clear of the whole

mess I was in, and of Phyllis, too,

all at the same time. Yeah, that's

what I thought. But what I didn't

know was that she was all set for

me. That she had outsmarted me again,

just like she always had...

NEFF'S VOICE

She was all set and waiting for me.

It could have been something in my

voice when I called her up that tipped

her off. And it could have been that

she had the idea already. And an

idea wasn't the only thing she had

waiting for me.

PHYLLIS

(In foreground)

In here, Walter.

NEFF

Hello, baby. Anybody else in the

house?

PHYLLIS

Nobody. Why?

NEFF

What's that music?

PHYLLIS

A radio up the street.

NEFF

Just like the first time I was here.

We were talking about automobile

insurance. Only you were thinking

about murder. And I was thinking

about that anklet.

PHYLLIS

And what are you thinking about now?

NEFF

I'm all through thinking. This is

goodbye.

PHYLLIS

Goodbye? Where are you going?

NEFF

It's you that's going, baby. Not me.

I'm getting off the trolley car right

at this corner.

PHYLLIS

Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's

have it, whatever it is.

NEFF

I have a friend who's got a funny

theory. He says when two people commit

a murder they're kind of on a trolley

car, and one can't get off without

the other. They're stuck with each

other. They have to go on riding

clear to the end of the line. And

the last stop is the cemetery.

PHYLLIS

Maybe he's got something there.

NEFF

You bet he has, Two people are going

to ride to the end of the line, all

right. Only I'm not going to be one

of them. I've got another guy to

finish my ride for me.

PHYLLIS

So you've got it all arranged, Walter.

NEFF

You arranged it for me. I didn't

have to do a thing.

PHYLLIS

Just who are you talking about?

NEFF

An acquaintance of yours. A Mr.

Zachetti. Come on, baby, I just got

into this because I knew a little

something about insurance, didn't I?

I was just a sucker. I'd have been

brushed-off as soon as you got your

hands on the money.

PHYLLIS

What are you talking about?

NEFF

Save it. I'm telling this. It's been

you and that Zachetti guy all along,

hasn't it?

PHYLLIS

That's not true.

NEFF

It doesn't make any difference whether

it's true or not. The point is Keyes

believes Zachetti is the guy he's

been looking for. He'll have him in

that gas chamber before he knows

what happened to him.

PHYLLIS

And what's happening to me all this

time?

NEFF

Don't be silly. What do you expect

to happen to you? You helped him do

the murder, didn't you? That's what

Keyes thinks. And what's good enough

for Keyes is good enough for me.

PHYLLIS

Maybe it's not good enough for me.

Walter. Maybe I don't go for the

idea. Maybe I'd rather talk.

NEFF

Sometimes people are where they can't

talk. Under six feet of dirt, for

instance. And if it was you, they'd

just charge it up to Zachetti,

wouldn't they. One more item on his

account. Sure they would. That's

just what they're going to do.

Especially since he's coming here,

tonight... Oh, in about fifteen

minutes from now, baby. With the

cops right behind him. It's all taken

care of.

PHYLLIS

And that'd make everything lovely

for you, wouldn't it?

NEFF

Right. And it's got to be done before

that suit of yours comes to trial,

and Lola gets a chance to sound off,

and they trip you up on the stand,

and you start to fold up and drag me

down with you.

PHYLLIS

Listen, Walter. Maybe I had Zachetti

here so they won't get a chance to

trip me up. So we can get that money

and be together.

NEFF

That's cute. Say it again.

PHYLLIS

He came here the first time just to

ask where Lola was. I made him come

back. I was working on him. He's

crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered. I

kept hammering into him that she was

with another man, so he'd get into

one of his jealous rages, and then

I'd tell him where she was. And you

know what he'd have done to her,

don't you, Walter.

NEFF

Yeah, and for once I believe you.

Because it's just rotten enough.

PHYLLIS

We're both rotten, Walter.

NEFF

Only you're just a little more rotten.

You're rotten clear through. You got

me to take care of your husband, and

then you got Zachetti to take care

of Lola, and maybe take care of me

too, and then somebody else would

have come along to take care of

Zachetti for you. That's the way you

operate isn't it, baby.

PHYLLIS

Suppose it is, Walter. Is what you've

cooked up for tonight any better?

NEFF

I don't like this music anymore.

It's too close. Do you mind if I

shut the window?

PHYLLIS

(Her voice low and

urgent)

Walter!

NEFF

What's the matter? Why don't you

shoot again? Maybe if I came a little

closer?

NEFF

How's that. Do you think you can do

it now?

NEFF

Why didn't you shoot, baby?

NEFF

Don't tell me it's because you've

been in love with me all this time.

PHYLLIS

No. I never loved you, Walter. Not

you, or anybody else. I'm rotten to

the heart. I used you, just as you

said. That's all you ever meant to

me -- until a minute ago. I didn't

think anything like that could ever

happen to me.

NEFF

I'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying.

PHYLLIS

I'm not asking you to buy. Just hold

me close.

NEFF

Goodbye, baby.

NEFF

Hey you. Come here a minute. I said

come here, Zachetti.

NEFF

The name is Neff.

ZACHETTI

Yeah? And I still don't like it.

What do you want?

NEFF

Look, kid, I want to give you a

present.

NEFF

Here's a nice new nickel.

ZACHETTI

What's the gag?

NEFF

Suppose you go back down the hill to

a drug store and make a phone call.

ZACHETTI

Keep your nickel and buy yourself an

ice cream cone.

NEFF

The number is Granite 0386. Ask for

Miss Dietrichson. The first name is

Lola.

ZACHETTI

Lola? She isn't worth a nickel. And

if I ever talk to her, it's not going

to be over any telephone.

NEFF

Tough, aren't you? Take the nickel.

Take it and call her. She wants you

to.

ZACHETTI

Yeah? She doesn't want any part of

me.

NEFF

I know who told you that, and it's

not true. She's in love with you.

Always has been. Don't ask me why. I

couldn't even guess.

NEFF

Now beat it. Granite 0386, I told

you.

NEFF

That way.

DISSOLVE TO:

NEFF

It's almost four-thirty now, Keyes.

It's cold. I wonder if she's still

lying there alone in that house, or

whether they've found her by now. I

wonder a lot of things, but they

don't matter any more, except I want

to ask you to do me a favor. I want

you to be the one to tell Lola, kind

of gently, before it breaks wide

open... Yes, and I'd like you to

look after her and that guy Zachetti,

so he doesn't get pushed around too

much. Because...

NEFF

Hello, Keyes.

NEFF

Up pretty early, aren't you? I always

wondered what time you got down to

work.

NEFF

Or did your little man pull you out

of bed?

KEYES

The janitor did. Seems you leaked a

little blood on the way in here.

NEFF

Wouldn't be surprised.

NEFF

I wanted to straighten out that

Dietrichson story for you.

KEYES

So I gather.

NEFF

How long have you been standing there?

KEYES

Long enough.

NEFF

Kind of a crazy story with a crazy

twist to it. One you didn't quite

figure out.

KEYES

You can't figure them all, Walter.

NEFF

That's right. You can't, can you?

And now I suppose I get the big

speech, the one with all the two-

dollar words in it. Let's have it,

Keyes.

KEYES

You're all washed up, Walter.

NEFF

Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.

KEYES

Walter, I'm going to call a doctor.

NEFF

(Bitterly)

What for? So they can patch me up?

So they can nurse me along till I'm

back on my feet? So I can walk under

my own power into that gas chamber

up in San Quentin? Is that it, Keyes?

KEYES

Something like that, Walter.

NEFF

Well, I've got a different idea.

Look here. Suppose you went back to

bed and didn't find these cylinders

till tomorrow morning, when the office

opens. From then on you can play it

any way you like. Would you do that

much for me, Keyes?

KEYES

Give me one good reason.

NEFF

I need four hours to get where I'm

going.

KEYES

You're not going anywhere, Walter.

NEFF

You bet I am. I'm going across the

border.

KEYES

You haven't got a chance.

NEFF

Good enough to try for.

KEYES

You'll never make the border.

NEFF

That's what you think. Watch me.

KEYES

(In a voice of stony

calm)

You'll never even make the elevator.

NEFF

So long, Keyes.

KEYES' VOICE

Hello... Send an ambulance to the

Pacific Building on Olive Street...

Yeah... It's a police job.

KEYES

How you doing, Walter?

NEFF

I'm fine. Only somebody moved the

elevator a couple of miles away.

KEYES

They're on the way.

NEFF

(Slowly and with great

difficulty)

You know why you didn't figure this

one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy

you were looking for was too close.

He was right across the desk from

you.

KEYES

Closer than that, Walter.

NEFF

I love you too.

NEFF

At the end of that... trolley line...

just as I get off... you be there...

to say goodbye... will you, Keyes?
