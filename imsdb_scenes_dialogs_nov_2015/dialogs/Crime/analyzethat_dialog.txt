FOR EDUCATIONAL

PURPOSES ONLY

DUCKS

It's Peezee. Gotta be.    He hates your

fuckin' guts.

CAESAR

(brooding)

I don't know.

DUCKS

Who else knew about the money? And

how did Peezee know they popped Tony

Cisco when we didn't even hear about

it 'til last night?

CAESAR

(sighs heavily)

I don't know.

DUCKS

(pressing)

What is so hard to understand here?

You said yourself Peezee was a

mamaluke and you couldn't trust him.

Now suddenly you're soft on the guy?

CAESAR

I just don't think it was him.

DUCKS

Okay, I'll bite. If not Peezee, then

who?

CAESAR

(slowly rising to

his full height)

I think it was you, Ducks.

DUCKS

(scared)

You gotta be kiddin'!

2.

DUCKS

Caesar, you know me! What kind of

fuckin' idiot would I have to be to

try that shit with you?

CAESAR

A dead fuckin' idiot.

VITTI

Garbage.   Change the channel.

WISEGUY

Okay, Paul.

CONVICT

Hey!   What're you doin', asshole!

CONVICT

Sorry, Mr. Vitti. Didn't mean any

disrespect.

WISEGUY

Punks.

3.

VITTI

I'm going to bed.

CUT TO:

VITTI

(suspicious)

What's goin' on, Earl?

EARL

They're transferring me.

VITTI

Why?

EARL

(shrugs)

Don't know. Thanks for looking out

for me, Mr. Vitti.

VITTI

Yeah.     Take it easy.

VITTI

Hey, Earl.     Is that my after-shave?

EARL

(blanches)

I'm sorry. I just grabbed stuff -- I

didn't know --

VITTI

That's okay.     Keep it.   Go ahead.

EARL

Thanks.     See you around.

CUT TO:

4.

CUT TO:

RABBI

And now I'd like to call on Isaac's

son, Dr. Ben Sobel, who would like to

say a few words.

BEN

(addressing audience)

It's very difficult for me to talk

about my father, because in a sense

I'm talking about two men.

BEN (CONT'D)

One, of    course, is the public Isaac

Sobel,    the eminent psychotherapist and

popular    author known to millions of

readers    around the world.

BEN

The second Isaac Sobel is the private

man -- my father -- Dad. And for

those of you who knew him well and

knew our family -- well, let's face it

-- my father was a psychotic, mind-

fucking prick. An arrogant, abusive,

ego-inflated --

JUMP CUT TO:

5.

BEN

(whispers)

Hello?

CUT TO:

VITTI

Guess who, you fuck!

BEN

Paul?

(to Laura)

I have to, uh, take this.

(into phone)

This isn't a good time.

VITTI

Not a good time? Let me explain

something to you. I'm in fucking Hell

right now. This is not a good time.

BEN

(sotto voce)

I can't talk right now.     My father

died!

VITTI

So what does that have to do with me?

BEN

Call me later --

VITTI

Don't hang up on, Sobel!    They're

tryin' to kill me!

6.

CUT BACK TO:

CUT TO:

WISEGUY #2

Ooh, they got tapioca. I love

tapioca.

(looks at Vitti)

You all right, Paul?

WISEGUY #2

Can I have your tapioca?

COYOTE

(to Vitti)

Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido?

COYOTE

Just keep walkin', Don Corleone.

COYOTE

Shut up!

COYOTE

I said, shut up, bitch!

7.

COYOTE

You're a dead man, jefe!

VITTI

(singing, with

appropriate dance

moves)

'When you're a Jet,

You're a Jet all the way,

From your first cigarette

To your last dyin' day...'

VITTI

'When you're a Jet,

If the shit hits the fan,

You got brothers around,

You're a family man...'

COYOTE

You're a dead man, jefe!

VITTI

(kicking at them,

singing)

'I like to be in America,

Okay by me in America...'

VITTI

'Tonight, tonight, won't be just

any night -- '

DISSOLVE TO:

8.

CUT TO:

BEN

(sighs deeply)

I can't believe he's gone.

LAURA

I can't believe what you said about

him. Cold and withholding? You had

to tell everybody?

MICHAEL

Nice. Why didn't you just take a

swing at the casket?

CUT TO:

BEN

Okay, I might have strayed from my

notes a little. I'm dealing with a

lot of stuff here. Grief is a

process.

MILLER

Dr. Sobel, I'm Agent Miller, this is

Special Agent Cerrone, Federal Bureau

of Investigation. We'd just like to

ask you a few questions, if we could.

LAURA

(testy)

Can I ask what this is about?    We just

came from the cemetery.

CERRONE

We know this is a difficult time for

you, Dr. Sobel. Sorry about your

father.

BEN

Thank you, I'm going to miss him

9.

terribly.

BEN

I mean -- there were issues -- as, I

think, there are with any father and

son. He wasn't especially warm --

LAURA

Ben -- once today? Enough.

BEN

No, I'm just saying, in spite of all

that --

BEN

-- he was a great, great legs.

(beat)

Man.

CERRONE

Dr. Sobel, you received a call this

morning from Paul Vitti?

BEN

What makes you think Paul Vitti called

me?

MILLER

Because we monitor and record all his

phone calls from Sing Sing.

BEN

Then yes.   He did.

LAURA

That was him on the phone?

BEN

Yes.

LAURA

And you didn't tell me?

MICHAEL

Wow.   Talk about withholding.

BEN

Michael?

10.

LAURA

You told her --

(nodding at

Agent Cerrone)

You told her at the drop of a hat.

BEN

She's with the F.B.I.   She needs to

know these things.

LAURA

Oh, I see. And I don't. Why tell

Laura? She couldn't possibly handle a

phone call.

BEN

Did I say that?

MILLER

You folks need a minute?

BEN

No, we're fine.

LAURA

If you don't need me anymore, I'll be

in the kitchen.

(to Agent Cerrone)

And two words of advice -- from one

professional woman to another -- Pant.

Suit.

BEN

She's grieving. It's a process.

MILLER

We understand.

(prompting)

Vitti?

BEN

Oh, yes. Paul Vitti and I were

involved in some organized crime

activity a couple of years ago. I

mean, I wasn't involved -- not

'involved' involved -- I was just

trying to help him therapeutically,

and some people tried to, uh, kill us.

No big deal.

MILLER

Well, shortly after you spoke, he

11.

seemed to have some kind of breakdown.

BEN

What kind of breakdown?

MILLER

I think you'd better go up there and

see for yourself.

CUT TO:

VITTI

(singing)

'I feel pretty, oh, so pretty, I feel

pretty and witty and bright...'

DR. CUTLER

I'm treating him with Thioridazine,

300 milligrams, T.I.D. That seems to

keep him pretty calm.

BEN

(watching Vitti)

That would keep a parade pretty calm.

He just keeps singing West Side Story

songs?

DR. CUTLER

'Tonight,' 'Maria,' the balcony scene.

BEN

The balcony scene?   Both parts?

DR. CUTLER

Oh, yeah. Get him to do 'Officer

Krupke.' It's really good.

VITTI

(singing)

'Who's the pretty girl in the mirror

12.

there? What mirror? Where?       Who can

that attractive girl be?'

BEN

Paul, it's me.    Ben Sobel.   Paul?

(beat)

Maria?

VITTI

Tony?

BEN

(with a look to

Dr. Cutler)

Oh, boy.

(to Vitti)

What's going on, Maria?

VITTI

The rumble -- it's tonight! I have to

get out of here. I don't want to die.

No, Chino, no!

BEN

Paul?   Paul?

DR. CUTLER

This is how it's been. He sings for a

while, then he goes completely

catatonic.

BEN

(skeptical)

Really. Can we take him to an

examining room?

DR. CUTLER

Of course.

CUT TO:

BEN

You already did a neurological work-

up?

DR. CUTLER

Yep. No tumors, no aneurisms, no sign

of stroke --

13.

BEN

Completely catatonic --

BEN

Totally gone. Well, I don't think

he's smart enough to be faking.

Street smart, yes, but we're talking

about an I.Q. just north of a bedroom

slipper.

BEN

So if I just stuck him with this

needle, he probably wouldn't even

respond.

DR. CUTLER

I don't know.    Try it.

BEN

Okay --

VITTI

(bursts into song)

'Boy, boy, crazy boy, keep cool, boy!

Got a rocket in your pocket, keep

cool-y cool boy -- '

CUT TO:

BEN

Paul, we're going to    give you some

tests to assess your    mental condition.

There's no pressure    -- just answer as

best you can. Do I     have your consent

to share the results    of these tests?

VITTI

Mommy's mad at me because I made a

boom on the rug.

14.

BEN

I'll take that as a yes. Okay, I'm

going to show you ten cards, each

containing a picture of an inkblot. I

want you to look at each card and tell

me what you see.

VITTI

I see you.   I see him.   I see a table.

BEN

Focus, Paul. You haven't seen the

card yet.

(hands him first card)

What does this look like to you? Take

your time.

VITTI

It looks like snow.

BEN

No, Paul, the other side.

VITTI

A bat.   A big bat. Or a weasel.

BEN

(taking notes)

Bat or weasel. All right.

VITTI

And he's got a little girl -- no, it's

a little boy -- in his teeth -- and

he's shakin' him and shakin' him

'cause the kid didn't wipe himself

good -- and the kid is screaming

because the bat-weasel ripped out his

throat and the blood is shootin' out

of his neck vein.

(pointing)

That's the blood.

BEN

(skeptical)

See anything else?

VITTI

Just the pussy with the teeth.

15.

BEN

(making more notes)

Pussy with teeth. Next card.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BEN

Now try repeating the numbers

backwards. For instance, if I was 1-

2-3, you will say 3-2-1. Okay, 7-3-8.

VITTI

3-2-1.

BEN

Try again.   7-3-8.

VITTI

Blue.

CUT TO:

BEN

Just tell me what you think is going

on in this picture.

VITTI

This is a picture of a guy -- nice,

hardworking guy -- comes home and

finds out his wife's been screwin'

this midget while he was out of town.

BEN

(appalled, makes

a note)

Screwing a midget. And how does the

story end?

VITTI

I think he works over the midget for a

while, then he blows 'em away.

16.

BEN

The wife or the midget?

VITTI

(smirks)

Trick question, right?    Both of 'em.

CUT TO:

BEN

Okay, Paul. Last test. In this one,

I'm going to start a sentence and you

complete it any way you want to.

Ready? 'I get

angry -- '

VITTI

Yes.

BEN

No, you're supposed to complete the

sentence.

VITTI

I did.   I said 'yes.'

BEN

I wasn't asking if you agreed or

disagreed; it was more like, 'I get

angry when -- '

VITTI

-- whenever.

BEN

Well, that about does it for me.

CUT TO:

BEN

Based on his symptoms and the test

results, I'd say brief psychotic

disorder -- if it persists, possibly

schizophreniform disorder. And Dr.

Cutler agrees with my diagnosis.

CHAPIN

So he's crazy?

17.

BEN

CHAPIN

BEN

CHAPIN

BEN

CHAPIN

(musing)

BEN

CHAPIN

BEN

CHAPIN

BEN

(thinks)

18.

CHAPIN

(thinks for a

long moment)

BEN

CHAPIN

BEN

CHAPIN

BEN

CHAPIN

BEN

(stricken)

CHAPIN

(firm)

BEN

(gulp)

19.

CHAPIN

You still want him?

BEN

(long beat to

decide)

Yes.

CUT TO:

BEN

Okay, Paul -- this way.

BEN

This way, Paul. Over here.      Here we

go.

BEN

Leg, Paul.   Leg up.

CUT TO:

VITTI

(enraged)

You fucking son-of-a-bitch! Where the

fuck do you get off sticking me with a

needle?

BEN

I knew it! I knew you were faking!

You used me to get you out of prison!

VITTI

Took you long enough. I was singin'

West Side Story for three fuckin'

days. I'm half a fag already.

20.

BEN

What are you talking about?

VITTI

I call you to say somebody's trying to

kill me and you hang up on me?

BEN

I was at the funeral home!

VITTI

You're my fuckin' doctor!

BEN

My father died!

VITTI

Me me me me!   He's dead!   Get over it.

BEN

Are you hearing yourself?

VITTI

(perfunctorily)

I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

BEN

Yeah, I can see how touched you are.

VITTI

What's the difference?   You hated him

anyway.

BEN

I loved my father. I'm feeling a lot

of grief right now.

VITTI

I'm not sensing it, but if you say so.

VITTI

(re:   pill)

What's that?

BEN

Decongestant. I'm getting over a

cold. All right, what's going on?

Who's after you?

VITTI

I don't know -- take your pick. Could

be my old family, or could be the

Rigazzis. Ever heard of Lou Rigazzi -

- Lou 'The Wrench'?

21.

BEN

Why "The Wrench"?

VITTI

Because he twisted a guy's head off

once.

BEN

Off?

VITTI

Off. Fuckin' Calabrese -- animals.

And comin' from me you know that's a

big compliment.

BEN

I'm sure they'd be flattered.    So --

VITTI

The feds are really putting the

pressure on. The families are

fighting each other again -- what's

left of 'em. It's the fall of the

fuckin' Roman Empire. It's

World War Three out there.

BEN

So what does that have to do with you?

VITTI

They knew I was gettin' out soon and

the last thing anybody wants to see is

me getting into it on either side.

BEN

Maybe if you just explain to

them -- that you're out of it now,

that you're starting a new life --

VITTI

Yeah,   they'll probably want to throw

me a   party and give me a gold watch.

Trust   me -- nobody's lookin' forward

to me   being out.

BEN

You are, aren't you?

VITTI

Me? Oh, yeah, my future looks real

fuckin' rosy.

CUT TO:

22.

BEN

Want to grab your stuff?

VITTI

I'm not gonna be here that long.

Jelly's pickin' me up in an hour.

BEN

Paul! I don't think you understand.

You're in my custody. I could get in

a lot of trouble if you screw up.

VITTI

Don't worry about it.     I'll call you

tomorrow.

BEN

Oh, no. You want to go back to Sing

Sing? Thursday's meatloaf night. I

can have you back there in no time.

The U.S. Attorney was very clear. You

stay with me; therapy every day; you

can't leave the area without

permission --

VITTI

What are you, my father now?

BEN

And you    have to get a job as soon as

you're    well enough, which is now. So

are you    coming in with me or do I have

to make    a phone call?

VITTI

I'm comin'.    Some fuckin' life this is

gonna be.

CUT TO:

CERRONE

You really think Vitti is crazy?

CHAPIN

Yeah, he's about as crazy as I am.

23.

Think about it. Locked up, he was

absolutely no use to me. But back on

the street, Vitti's still powerful

enough to pose a threat to both

families. It's like throwing gasoline

on a fire.

DAVIS

If we can use Vitti to escalate this

war, we might just end up putting them

all away.

MILLER

That's if he goes back to his old

life.

CHAPIN

If? People like Paul Vitti     don't

change. This guy's been a     menace to

society since he was twelve    years old.

Being a criminal is all he    knows.

Trust me.

DAVIS

He's gonna head straight for trouble.

Then all we have to do is sit back and

pick up the pieces. We could get

twenty, maybe even thirty indictments

next time the grand jury convenes.

CHAPIN

(smiles)

You know, Giuliani started this way.

DAVIS

You running for mayor?

CHAPIN

Could happen.     Just stick with Vitti.

CUT TO:

LAURA

How could you? How could you bring

him here? That --

(shuddering)

-- mobster -- in my home -- eating off

my dishes.

24.

(looking at the plate

in her hand, disgusted)

Ewww.

BEN

I didn't have a lot of choice.

LAURA

Oh, there's a law that says you have

to bring a gangster home?

BEN

I told you. He's in my custody.      I'm

a federal institution.

LAURA

You should be in an institution.     Why

couldn't he just go home?

BEN

His wife and kids aren't here.

They're in Ohio.

LAURA

Ohio! Sure. Everyone gets to be in

Ohio except me.

BEN

His life was threatened and he didn't

want to endanger his family.

LAURA

How thoughtful! What about

endangering our family?

(worried)

I think my teeth are loose.     Feel my

teeth.

BEN

Honey, your teeth are fine. I know

it's an imposition, but what could I

do? I didn't want him here. They -

LAURA

You didn't want him, I didn't want

him, but here he is!

LAURA

(covering, cheerful)

Here he is!

VITTI

Coffee?

25.

LAURA

What?

VITTI

Somebody said something about coffee.

LAURA

That was you.    You said you wanted

some.

VITTI

So what's the holdup?

LAURA

(to Ben)

Why don't you make your friend some

coffee. I'm going upstairs to take a

long bath and hopefully drown.

BEN

You'll have to forgive her.     She's

usually a great hostess.

VITTI

I understand. She's uncomfortable.

The whole situation's a little awkward

with me bein' here -- but let's face

it, Emily fuckin' Post she's not.

BEN

Emily fuckin' Post. Well, that

explains why she rarely used her

middle name.

VITTI

Listen, I got a friend coming over.     I

didn't want you to be surprised.

BEN

What    kind of friend? Because if it's

'The    Wrench,' or 'The Power Drill' or

any    other kind of

tool    --

VITTI

Not that kind of friend.     It's a

personal thing.

BEN

They won't stay late, will they?

VITTI

(stares at him)

Are you really that pussy-whipped?

26.

BEN

I'm not -- this has nothing to do with

Laura.

VITTI

I heard her busting your balls.

BEN

We were having a disagreement. A

certain amount of conflict is normal

in a marriage.

VITTI

Or?

BEN

Or what?

VITTI

Or you're pussy-whipped.

BEN

Paul --

VITTI

Good night, Whippy.

BEN

(calls after him)

Remember, this is only temporary.

VITTI

Oh, really? I didn't hear you the

tenth fuckin' time.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BEN

(oblivious)

Mike, can we talk for a second?

MICHAEL

Sure.     What?

27.

BEN

MICHAEL

BEN

MICHAEL

BEN

MICHAEL

BEN

MICHAEL

BEN

MICHAEL

BEN

28.

MICHAEL

Good night, Whippy.

CUTE GIRL

I gotta get home. What was that

about?

MICHAEL

I have no idea. Parenting stuff.

CUT TO:

WOMAN (V.O.)

Ohhhhh!   Ohhhhh, Paul!

CUT TO:

WOMAN (O.S.)

Ohhhh, God!   Oh, oh, oh, oh!

BEN

This has to be some kind of record,

don't you think? It's been like forty

minutes.

LAURA

How long are you going to let them go

on?

BEN

Let them? How much longer can he go?

Another twenty minutes, I'm either

breaking it up or calling the Guinness

Book of Records.

LAURA

Oh, give me a break.    She's got to be

29.

faking.   Nobody sounds like that.

BEN

(suggestively)

That's not entirely true.

LAURA

Okay, sometimes you do sound like

that.

CUT TO:

WOMAN (O.S.)

(high-pitched now)

Ah, ah, ah, ah...!

CUT TO:

CERRONE

Oh, come on.    Nobody sounds like that.

CUT TO:

VITTI

What?

BEN

(indignant)

I have a 17-year-old son.

VITTI

So let him get his own fuckin' girl.

30.

BEN

Can I talk to you, please?

VITTI

Actually, I'm right in the middle of

someone.

BEN

Miss? Excuse me.     There's no smoking

in this house.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BEN

What do you think you're doing?

VITTI

Minding my own fuckin' business, like

you should be doin'.

BEN

Well, it's a little hard with the live

sex show going on in the guest room.

VITTI

I've been in prison for two and a half

years. What am I supposed to do?

BEN

Go to a hotel.

VITTI

That's what I wanted to do, but you

told me I had no choice -- it was

either here or Sing Sing.

BEN

I'm not trying to punish you. These

aren't my rules, but I have a

responsibility here. Besides, I

thought you might like a nice home-

cooked meal after being in prison that

long.

31.

VITTI

Yeah, that's what I've been jerkin'

off about for eight hundred

consecutive nights -- a nice home-

cooked meal.

(making a jerking

motion)

Ohhhh, tuna casserole.

BEN

That girl is not staying here.

VITTI

I think you're jealous.

BEN

Oh, yeah, I'm really jealous.

VITTI

I didn't hear nothin' comin' out of

your room.

BEN

We don't think it's necessary to wake

the neighbors every time we have sex.

VITTI

Hey, if you're really quiet, you might

be able to do it without even wakin'

up your wife.

SHEILA (O.S.)

(moaning)

Ohhh.   Ohhh.

VITTI

I told her if I wasn't back in two

minutes to start without me. I gotta

go.

BEN

This is not a good start, Paul.

CUT TO:

32.

LAURA

Aunt Ester, I'm so sorry we had to put

you up at the hotel. We wanted you

here with us, but we had an unexpected

house guest.

AUNT ESTHER

(sighs)

Your father always had room for us.

BEN

I'm sorry.

(mutters to Laura)

Next time I lose a parent, I'll be

sure to reserve the guest room.

SHEILA

(screaming)

Go to hell, Paul! You just go to

hell!

VITTI (O.S.)

Go ahead! Get out of here, you crazy

fuckin' whore.

VITTI

Go back to turning tricks in Jersey

for all I fuckin' care.

VITTI

How's it goin'?

(sees buffet)

Oh, we got food. Good.

LAURA

(smiling)

Ben?

BEN

(quickly)

Paul?

33.

VITTI

Oh, great. Jew food. Who do you have

to fuck to get some bacon around here?

VITTI

Not you, I'm guessing.

BEN

(snags Vitti's arm)

Why don't we go to my office?   I'll

make you a plate.

CUT TO:

VITTI

What is it with your relatives?   They

tend to overreact quite a bit.

BEN

I know. All you did was flash

everybody in the dining room.

VITTI

So? From the look of 'em, some of

those broads haven't seen the old

salcicc' in a long time. It's good

for them.

BEN

Well, when the paramedics revive my

Aunt Goldie, I'll be sure to ask her.

Sit.

BEN

Ah ah ah!

BEN

So what are you going to do, Paul?

VITTI

What do you mean?

BEN

With your life.

34.

VITTI

First I'm gonna find out who's tryin'

to kill me. I'm a target. Somebody

could shoot right through that window

-- blow my fuckin' head off.

BEN

Okay, that's a priority. Have you

thought about what you're going to do

for work?

VITTI

Yeah. I'm too big for a jockey so

I was thinkin' maybe a hairdresser.

They'll call me Mr. Paul.

BEN

Come on. There must be something you

like to do.

VITTI

I like hitting a guy on the head with

a baseball bat.

BEN

Oh, sporting goods. We'll check the

want ads tomorrow but don't get your

hopes up. Anything else?

VITTI

Shylocking, bookmaking, unions, the

usual --

BEN

Who are you?

VITTI

Who am I? I'm the guy who's paying

you $150 an hour to play these stupid

fuckin' games. You know who I am.

BEN

I know that.   I mean what are you?

VITTI

What do you mean, 'What am I?'

BEN

I just want to know how you see

yourself.

35.

VITTI

You're making me very fuckin' nervous.

BEN

Just answer the question.     What are

you?

VITTI

(shrugs)

I'm the boss.

BEN

Really? The boss of what -- Jelly?

You're not the boss of me. So what

are you the boss of?

VITTI

You, you're good. I see what you're

doing here.

BEN

What am I doing, Paul?

VITTI

You're pissing me off is what you're

doing. Look at me. It's starting

again, the anxiety.

BEN

I understand.

BEN (CONT'D)

You've    spent your whole life becoming

who you    are and now you can't be that

anymore    -- that's gotta be scary. If

you're    not Paul Vitti the mob boss,

who are    you?

BEN

Well, let's think. When you were a

kid, What did you want to be?

VITTI

I don't know.    Who remembers that

stuff?

BEN

You must've wanted to be something

when you were little -- fireman?

VITTI

No.

BEN

Baseball player?

36.

VITTI

VITTI

(corrects him)

BEN

VITTI

BEN

VITTI

BEN

VITTI

BEN

38.

VITTI

Yeah, so?

BEN

So what happened?

VITTI

I don't know.    Nothing happened.

BEN

So why didn't you become a cowboy?

VITTI

I lived in East Harlem! I joined a

street gang when I was 12 and that was

it.

BEN

Something else happened when you were

twelve.

VITTI

What?

BEN

(prompting)

Something that made you very sad?

VITTI

The Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to

L.A. Everybody took it pretty hard.

BEN

Something else.

VITTI

We playin' a guessing game here?

BEN

Paul! Your father was murdered!

Right in front of you. Remember?

VITTI

Do I remember? I think about it every

fuckin' day of my life. What's that

got to do with it?

BEN

It's got everything   to do with it. He

gave you the cowboy   suit. With a

white hat. He was    in the mob, but he

wanted you to be a   good guy, didn't

he?

39.

VITTI

Yeah.   He did.

BEN

He didn't want you in the gang life.

He only did it himself so you wouldn't

have to. He was trying to buy you a

better life than his.

VITTI

(crying harder)

He always said he wanted me to go to

college. I didn't even finish high

school.

BEN

Well, Paul, this could be a  great

opportunity for you. You're   right

back where you were when you  were

twelve. You've got some big   choices

to make.

VITTI

Okay.   Okay.   That's enough of that

shit.

BEN

It's not shit, Paul. My point is,

when you're a child, you think

anything is possible. Wouldn't it be

great to think like that now?

VITTI

(retreating back into

his cynicism)

Yeah, just sprinkle some fuckin' fairy

dust on me.

BEN

I'm just saying you've got to keep

an open mind and explore some new

possibilities. Try some different

things -- maybe you'll connect with

one of them. There's a career

counselor I work with. I can call

him for you. He may be able to help

you find a job.

VITTI

You mean working for somebody? I'm

supposed to take orders from some guy

who used to get me coffee?

(starts sweating and

40.

breathing hard)

I can't do that. It's not right.

It's not me.

BEN

How do you know unless you try?

JELLY

(calls out)

Hiya, Doc. Sorry about the window.

CUT TO:

JELLY

I love  lox and bagels. I dated a

Jewish  woman once. Actually, she

might  have been the love of my life,

but my  mother broke it up.

JELLY (CONT'D)

She was always hockin' me a chinick

about the madels. A wonderful woman,

my mother, but she fuckin' hates the

Hebes.

LAURA

Really.

(noting mountain of

food on his plate)

More smoked salmon? Don't be shy.

BEN

Jelly -- what are you doing here?

JELLY

Makin' new friends. How's it going,

Doc? I brought some clothes for Mr.

Vitti.

LAURA

(indicating the door)

Ben?

41.

BEN

That's great, Jelly. I'd love to

catch up with you -- outside.

JELLY

(rising)

You got it.

(to Laura)

Thanks, Mrs. S.

(to others)

So long, everybody.    Ess gesunterhait.

CUT TO:

JELLY

So. Long time no see.     You look good,

Doc.

BEN

(trying to be pleasant)

And you, Jelly -- you look --

(can't find words for

how he looks)

Did you get a haircut? I thought you

were in prison.

JELLY

It would appear not.

BEN

How'd you get out?

JELLY

New trial. The evidence in my first

trail was, you know, tainted. Turns

out two of the witnesses against me

changed their minds -- and the third

one, he died after a short illness.

BEN

What did he have?

JELLY

Gunshot wound to the head.

BEN

That's not an illness.

42.

JELLY

Yeah, but it is short.

BEN

(to Vitti)

Where are you going?

VITTI

I got stuff to do.

BEN

What kind of stuff?

VITTI

(as he gets into

the car)

Calm down. I'll be back.

BEN

You can't leave without my permission.

VITTI

Oh, yeah?   Watch me.   Drive, Jelly.

BEN

That's it, Paul. I forbid you to go.

VITTI

Stop sweating, Doc.     I'll be back.

BEN

(shouts anxiously)

If you screw this up, Paul -- Paul!

BEN

(angrily)

Shit!   Shit, shit, shit!

AUNT GOLDIE

So, the fat one -- he's single?

CUT TO:

43.

MASIELLO

Paulie, great to see you! You're

lookin' good, kid. Lookin' very good.

Jelly, how are ya?

MASIELLO

So, Paul, we heard you had some

trouble while you were away. Some

'mental' problems.

VITTI

No, I'm okay. It was an act. I had

to pretend I was nuts. There were

people watching me all the time.

MASIELLO

Little people?

VITTI

Doctors. They never woulda let me out

if they thought I was normal.

MASIELLO

So you ain't crazy?

VITTI

You want to see crazy? Just tell me

who's trying to kill me. I'll show

you crazy.

MASIELLO

We're in a war, Paul -- nobody's safe

right now. The Rigazzis are walkin'

all over us. We got next to nothing

coming in, and I don't have to tell

you, you don't buy a lot of muscle

without money these days. We need

you, Paul. The family needs you.

VITTI

I can't do it, Sal.   I'm out of it.

MASIELLO

Come on, Paulie. Nobody used to do

the big jobs like you. Air France--

they're still talkin' about it.

44.

VITTI

Sal, even if I wanted to -- the feds

MASIELLO

After your father died, I always

treated you like my own son. You know

that.

VITTI

I know.

MASIELLO

He was a good man. I still miss him.

VITTI

Yeah, I do too.

MASIELLO

So you'll think about it.    For me,

Paulie?

VITTI

Yeah, okay, I'll think about it.

MASIELLO

(brightening)

Hey, what is this -- a fuckin' funeral

here? You just got back from college

for Chrissakes. We should be havin' a

party for you.

(to bartender)

Hey, Nino, give everybody a round

here. We gotta drink to Paul.

VITTI

I can't, Sal.    I gotta go talk to the

boss.

MASIELLO

I understand. No problem. It's good

to have you back, Paul.

(embraces him)

Don't forget what I said. We're

countin' on you.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

45.

EDDIE

Yeah, what?

VITTI

'Yeah, what?'    That's how you answer

the door?

EDDIE

You got a problem with that?

VITTI

Yeah.

VITTI

Where is she?

PATTY (O.S.)

(calls out)

In the kitchen, Paul.

CUT TO:

PATTY

Paul -- what a nice surprise.

VITTI

How's it goin', Patty?

PATTY

Good.   It's good. Give me a kiss,

you.

VITTI

Sorry to hear about Carmine.     He was a

good man.

PATTY

Yeah. You live with a person twenty-

one years, then one day they're

46.

pulling his torso out of the river.

It's hard.

VITTI

I'll bet -- especially with all the

talk about you being the one who put

him there.

PATTY

That's why I try not to gossip, Paul.

It's ugly. Just a sec.

(screaming to ceiling)

Michelle! Teresa! It's ten-thirty!

Stop fucking around and get ready for

ballet!

(to Vitti)

It's hard being a single parent and a

career woman.

VITTI

Yeah, I'm sure you're very busy.

PATTY

The pressure -- it's awful. For

instance, a lot of people think, now

that you're out, you're going to try

and take the family back from me. But

I said, no, Paul would never do that.

(smiling)

By the way, how are Marie and the

kids? Still in Ohio? In Shaker

Heights? At 1356 Locust?

VITTI

(enraged)

You even go near them, you crazy bitch

--

PATTY

(quietly)

Don't make me call my guys in. You

may need the shit kicked out of you,

but not in here. I just mopped.

PATTY

(smoothing clothes,

flushed and a little

excited)

Wow.   Have you been working out?

VITTI

Yeah, I been workin' out who's trying

47.

to kill me. I'd love to hear your

thoughts on that.

PATTY

It's a dog-eat-dog world out there.

Nobody's gonna be safe unless we can

end this thing with the Rigazzis.

VITTI

So then you didn't have nothin' to do

with it.

PATTY

(hurt)

Oh, Paul. You actually think I would

kill you? All the years we've known

each other -- the Christmas parties,

the fun times at the beach. It

wouldn't be right. I want us to be

friends.

(smiles demurely)

Who knows? Maybe we'll be more than

friends. Want to lick my beaters?

VITTI

(declining)

Thanks. I gotta see a guy about a

business thing.

PATTY

What kind of business? You know, if

you get something going, we would

expect some kind of consideration -- a

little taste.

VITTI

No, this is a legitimate business.

PATTY

(shudders)

Oh, Paul. I just got a chill.

VITTI

I just want to be left alone.   Put my

life back together -- straight  up this

time. Put the word out, will   ya?

Nobody's got nothin' to worry  about

from me.

PATTY

Sure, Paul.    I understand.

48.

PATTY

(calls after him)

Don't be a stranger!

PATTY

(turning to Eddie)

Watch him like a hawk. If he steps

out of line, it would break my heart,

but shoot him in the fuckin' head.

CUT TO:

VITTI

Look at the size of that trunk. You

could fit three people in there.

(off their

shocked looks)

Not people -- suitcases. It's a joke.

VITTI

So what are you driving now?

MR. MacINERNY

We have a Lexus.

VITTI

(nods)

It's a fancy Toyota, right? The Japs

make good cars, but I ain't that quick

to forget Pearl Harbor.

CUT TO:

VITTI

(signals the MAITRE D')

Mario, put Mr. Torre at table five.

49.

JOEY BOOTS

Paul, I heard you were out.

VITTI

Hey, Joey.

JOEY BOOTS

All dressed up for dinner, huh?

VITTI

Yeah.

MAITRE D'

Paul, that table for six is ready.

You can send them back.

JOEY BOOTS

You're working here?

VITTI

(dying)

Nah -- not really. It's like -- I'm

on parole, so I just -- I come in, I

greet people.

JOEY BOOTS

Okay. I get it. Nice seein' you,

Paul. Don't want to hold you up. You

got people to seat.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

50.

BUSINESSMAN

Thanks, Paul.    Appreciate it.

BUSINESSMAN

Hey, could you get us a big bottle of

Pellegrino and another round of

drinks?

BUSINESSMAN

And more bread when you get a chance.

VITTI

You want more bread?

VITTI

I'll get your drinks now.

CUT TO:

YOUNG MAN

This stone is supposed to be a 'G'

color, but it looks kind of yellow,

doesn't it?

VITTI

(distracted)

Fluorescent light. Makes everything

look yellow.

QUICK CUT TO:

51.

FIANCEE

I thought fluorescent light makes

everything look blue?

CUT TO:

VITTI

(sweating)

What am I -- Edison?    I'm telling you,

it's a 'G.'

YOUNG MAN

Can I look at it with a lens?

CUT TO:

VITTI

(completely distracted)

What?

FIANCEE

A lens.    Do you have a lens?

CUT TO:

52.

OWNER

Are you all right?

VITTI

I'm gonna do us both a big favor.    I

quit.

CUT BACK TO:

VITTI

You want to see the manager?

(grabs his crotch)

Here's the manager. Now take a hike,

you fuckin' deadbeats.

VITTI

(calls after them)

Get a Hyundai!

CUT TO:

VITTI

(distraught)

I can't deal with this shit. My

grades suck, I'm gettin' in fights

every day, and if I get suspended

again my mother's gonna fuckin' kill

me -- if the nuns don't kill me first.

BEN

(nodding)

Eins, zwei, drei!

VITTI

What?

53.

VITTI'S MOTHER

(elbows him)

Sit up straight! Pay attention when

the doctor talks to you. This is

costing money.

VITTI

Ma?   What are you doin' here?

BEN (FREUD)

(snorts some cocaine)

Acht gemacht gehunden nicht.

VITTI'S MOTHER

I tell him the same thing.

CUT TO:

LAURA

Now in here, I thought we'd get rid of

the wallpaper and maybe put in some

wainscoting --

54.

LAURA

(to decorator)

Don't look, don't look.

LAURA

Do you realize it's almost noon?

VITTI

Really? Do me a favor, honey -- make

me a sandwich.

LAURA

You want a sandwich? Make it

yourself. I'm not afraid of you, Mr.

Oh-I'm-A-Great-Big-Mobster Man. I

want you out of my house.

LAURA (CONT'D)

I've had   it with the bathrobe and the

skulking   around and the girlfriend

who, I'm   sorry, is so obviously faking

it's not   even funny. Enough!

VITTI

Coulda had that sandwich made by now.

LAURA

(tries new tack)

Okay. You don't like me and I don't

like you. We can at least agree on

that, right?

VITTI

Okay.

LAURA

I'm going to be honest with you -- I'm

a very anxious person --

VITTI

Hey!    Me, too.

LAURA

We have so much in common. Anyway,

this is not helping me, it's not

helping my marriage, and I know Ben

really needs some alone time. So I'm

asking you -- as a human being --

could you please leave?

(off Vitti's look)

Yes, I'll make you a sandwich.

55.

VITTI

Ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato,

mayonnaise, no onion.

CUT TO:

BEN

(concerned)

Where are you going?

VITTI

Where am I going? The orphanage found

my real parents. They want me back.

(to Jelly)

Put those in the car.

(to Ben)

I'm goin' to Jelly's.

BEN

(to Vitti)

The hell you are. You're supposed to

be in my custody. We have therapy

today.

VITTI

For what? The more we talk the worse

I get. I had that dream again.

BEN

The one where you're Mussolini?

VITTI

No, the other one.

BEN

The limp sword dream?

JELLY

(at car)

I probably shouldn't be listening to

this.

VITTI

So don't!

JELLY

Sorry.

56.

BEN

(to Vitti)

Do you think this dream might be

sexual?

VITTI

I know what you're thinkin'. The

sword is my cock and I can't get it

up, but that ain't it. I saw Sheila

last night and I had a hard-on you

could swing from.

BEN

(winces)

I don't want to know that.

VITTI

You coulda hung wet towels on it.

JELLY

(calls out)

He's like a racehorse in that area.

BEN

Okay!   I get it.

VITTI

(to  Jelly)

Wait in the  car!

(to  Ben)

So what does  it mean?

BEN

Sex can represent a lot of things. In

your case I think it's about

performance anxiety. Trying to find a

job that fits.

VITTI

Doc -- nothing's gonna fit. That

nine-to-five bullshit -- I'll fuckin'

kill myself if I have to do that for

the rest of my life. You know they

take taxes out of your check? What

the fuck is that? I'm doomed. I'm

gonna end up selling hot dogs on the

street.

(starts breathing hard

and sweating)

Look at me. I'm havin' a fuckin'

panic attack here. My heart's beatin'

like a rabbit.

BEN

You're hyperventilating.

57.

BEN

Breathe into this.

VITTI

(speaks through bag)

This is your fault.

BEN

Excuse me?

VITTI

Tellin' me I have to get a job like

I'm some fuckin' nobody. It was

humiliating! Thanks a lot.

BEN

(jumps up, in a

total rage)

Hey, I'm doing the best I can!     If you

can't appreciate that, or if my    best

isn't good enough for you, then    maybe

you should find somebody else to    talk

to, you selfish prick!

BEN

Sorry.

VITTI

What the hell was that?

BEN

I'm fine.    I'm grieving.   It's a

process.

VITTI

Now what are you takin'?

BEN

Echinacea and goldenseal. Do you know

the TV show 'Little Caesar'?

VITTI

Yeah, I know it.

BEN

The producer of that show is a man

58.

named Raoul Berman. A mutual friend

told him I knew you and Mr. Berman

called me this morning. He wants to

meet you.

VITTI

For what?

BEN

Meet him and find out.

CUT TO:

LAURA

We finally got him out of the house --

why are we having dinner with him? I

mean, how professional is that?

BEN

This is not social. Paul's meeting a

television producer who might have a

job for him. He's nervous and wants

me here as a buffer. I'm a buffer,

that's all.

LAURA

He's a grown man. I don't see why he

needs a chaperone.

BEN

He doesn't. He needs a buffer.    I'm

here in buffer capacity only.

LAURA

Ben, if you say 'buffer' one more time

--

LAURA

Didn't you just take two of those?

BEN

No, that was something else.

LAURA

Well, you better not drink anything.

You know what happens.

BEN

Laura? I'm a doctor?     I think I know

what I'm doing.

59.

BEN

(quietly, behind

her back)

Buffer.

CUT TO:

MILLER

(into radio)

They're all inside. We're going to

get something to eat. We'll be back

before they finish dinner.

CUT TO:

RAOUL

I adore this place. Best sushi in

town. Have you tried the yellowtail,

Paul?

VITTI

(makes a face)

No. We gettin' any real food?     This

is like eatin' fuckin' bait.

BEN

Bait! That's funny. Honey, did you

hear what Paul just said? He said

this is like eating bait.

LAURA

(not amused)

I heard him. And I think it was

'effing bait.'

60.

VITTI

BEN

VITTI

BEN

(pointing to his

lower lip)

(to Raoul)

VITTI

(quietly)

BEN

(to Raoul)

LAURA

(aside to Ben)

RAOUL

(eyeing Ben oddly)

VITTI

RAOUL

61.

BEN

Wow. That would be incredible. Did

you hear that, Paul? Raoul wants to

know if you'd be interested in working

on his show as a consultant. You

know, give technical advice, coach the

actors --

VITTI

(quietly to Ben)

In two seconds I'm gonna put a fork in

your eye.

BEN

(suddenly cowed)

Got it.

RAOUL

So what do you think, Paul?

VITTI

Yeah, sure, whatever.

RAOUL

Fantastic!

SHEILA

This is so exciting. Mr. Berman, I

love your show. Anthony Bella, the

guy who plays Nicky Caesar -- I think

he grew up in Bensonhurst next door to

my cousin's friend's husband.

VITTI

That's her claim to fame.

(to Sheila)

I hate to bust your bubble, but he's

not from Bensonhurst. He's a

professional Italian. He grew up in

Connecticut or something like that.

SHEILA

Well, wherever he's from, I think he's

a wonderful actor.

JELLY

Yeah, I bet he gets a lot of pussy.

VITTI

What's the matter with you?   We got

women at the table.

JELLY

You said 'fuckin'.'

62.

VITTI

That's different. It's colorful.

BEN

Hey, speaking of colorful -- this

peacock walks into a bar --

LAURA

Oh, my god.

(to a passing waiter,

rising her half-empty

drink)

Could I get another one, please?

BEN

And one for me.

LAURA

No.    No more for the Buffer.

VITTI

(tries a desperate save)

So. I see in the paper where

Oklahoma! might win the Tony award.

VITTI

(shouts)

Down!!!

BEN

(to Vitti)

What the hell was that?

VITTI

I think somebody's got it in for

Raoul.

63.

RAOUL

(wide-eyed)

Holy fucking shit.

(grinning)

That was phenomenal!

CUT TO:

JELLY

Hey, pal -- got a light?

GUNMAN

Where's your cigarette?

JELLY

I'm trying to cut down.

CUT TO:

LAURA

I don't know why you feel you have to

save this man.

BEN

It's my job.   He needs me.

LAURA

So that automatically means you have

to help him? You're always doing this

-- putting other people's needs ahead

of your own, like you're this martyr

or saint or something. It's like

living with Mother Teresa.

64.

BEN

Actually, I hear she was tough to live

with. Lot of parties, loud music --

lepers.

LAURA

You don't need this in your

life -- especially not now. You

really need to be grieving for your

father.

BEN

I am.

LAURA

Really?   I haven't seen it.

BEN

Well, you know, it's a process. I

mean, we had issues -- there's some

anger -- but I'll work it out.

LAURA

It's okay, honey. You can let it go.

BEN

No, I'm -- it's okay.

BEN

It's just a confusing time. I became

a therapist because he was a

therapist, so obviously his approval

was very important to me. But is that

the only reason I did it? I don't

know. And now that he's gone, why do

I keep doing it? Is this what I

really want?

LAURA

I just want you to be happy.

BEN

Maybe you're right.

(kisses her)

Maybe it's time I started focusing on

me, and, you know, satisfying some of

65.

my desires.

LAURA

(apologetic)

Oh, honey, I just brushed my teeth.

BEN

No, that's not what I meant.     I just

need --

(at a loss)

I don't know what.

CUT TO:

VITTI

I'm gonna ask you once nicely.     Who

you working for?

GUNMAN

Fuck you.

VITTI

Fuck me?    Fine. Jelly?

VITTI

I'll ask you again.     Who you working

for?

JELLY

He's screamin' too loud.     Hold on a

second.

JELLY

Go ahead.

VITTI

Who are you working for?

66.

GUNMAN

Nobody!

VITTI

Drop him, Jelly.

GUNMAN

Okay! Okay!    Rigazzi!   I'm working

for Rigazzi!

VITTI

Pull him back up.

VITTI

What's the matter with you?

JELLY

You said drop him.

VITTI

I said pull him back up.

JELLY

That's not what I heard.

VITTI

You heard what you wanted to hear.

JELLY

Okay, you got me there.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RIGAZZI

What the hell happened to you?

67.

GUNMAN

Vitti threw me off a roof.

RIGAZZI

Vitti? You talked to Vitti?     What did

you say to him?

GUNMAN

Nothing. I didn't tell him anything.

Mr. Rigazzi, can I

go -- I think my leg's broken.

RIGAZZI

That must hurt.

RIGAZZI

I hate to see people in pain.

(to soldiers)

Get him out of here.

SOLDIER

What about Vitti?

RIGAZZI

(musing)

He's a hard man to kill. But he's not

immortal. Our time will come.

CUT TO:

CAESAR

I like mine burnt.

MELLO

I don't know how you like your

sausage? Twenty fuckin' years we been

doin' this. So you got the money?

68.

CAESAR

(coughing, eyes

watering)

Not all of it. I'm still light about

fifteen large.

(blinded by smoke)

Can we cut? This is ridiculous.

RAOUL (O.S.)

(shouts)

Cut! Can you do something about the

fucking smoke?

RAOUL

(to Vitti)

This is the problem with shooting on

location. But it's worth it for the

authenticity.

VITTI

Yeah, this is real authentic.

RAOUL

(calls out)

Tony! Come here a second.

(to Vitti)

Anthony Bella. He plays Nicky Caesar.

VITTI

I know who he is. They used to watch

the show up at Sing Sing.

RAOUL

(delighted)

Are you shitting me?

RAOUL

Tony, this is Paul Vitti.

TONY BELLA

(Australian accent)

You don't have to tell me who he is.

(shakes Paul's hand)

It's a pleasure, mate.

69.

VITTI

(reacting to accent)

Mate? I don't believe this! You're

an English guy? You ain't even

Italian.

TONY BELLA

Australian-Italian. We got some

paisans down under.

VITTI

Down under what?

RAOUL

(to Tony Bella)

How incredible is this? Paul tells me

they watch the show in Sing Sing!

TONY BELLA

Fantastic!    That's so fuckin' great.

VITTI

I wouldn't wet my pants over it.      They

watch 'Supermarket Sweep,' too.

VITTI

You laugh too much.

TONY BELLA

So, Paul, you going to join us?

VITTI

Yeah.    You got a good setup here.

TONY BELLA

Great.   See you later then.

VITTI

Coupla things, though. I don't know

who makes these decisions, but some of

this, it don't look right.

RAOUL

(concerned)

I sensed it myself. Which elements

strike you as wrong?

VITTI

The people mainly. I mean, you got a

boss who speaks Australian. What the

fuck is that? And I'm guessing your

70.

background is -- what?

RAOUL

The theater, mostly.

VITTI

Yeah, the theater. So how about if I

bring in some guys that I know -- you

know, more 'authentic.'

RAOUL

I would be eternally grateful.

Anything else?

VITTI

(thinks)

Yeah. One of those trailers like the

stars have.

RAOUL

(slight hesitation)

Done.

(shakes his hand)

I'll put that in the works right now.

JELLY

You really gonna do this?

VITTI

No fuckin' way. I've had it with this

job bullshit. A week of this and I'd

either shoot myself or shoot Raoul.

But it's good cover while I figure out

my next move. Call the guys.

JELLY

You got it.

CUT TO:

71.

P.A. (PRODUCTION ASSISTANT)

They're ready to start shooting, Mr.

Vitti.

VITTI

Yeah, ten minutes, tell 'em.

CUT TO:

SOLDIER

Walk this way.

BEN

There must be some mistake.    I didn't

order a limo.

SOLDIER

Get in the car.

CUT TO:

BEN

(nervous, but trying

to keep it light)

Hello.   I'm Ben Sobel. And you are --

?

72.

MASIELLO

You're the shrink who's taking care of

Paul Vitti?

BEN

Yes, sir. That's right.

(to guy with

groceries)

Could you be careful, because I think

they put the eggs on the bottom.

MASIELLO

So?    Is he nuts or what?

BEN

Who?

MASIELLO

Paulie.     Is he nuts?

BEN

I can't discuss a patient's case with

anyone --

MASIELLO

Discuss it.

BEN

I'd say he's still suffering from

chronic anxiety and --

MASIELLO

And what.

BEN

We call it Antisocial Personality

Disorder. Sociopathy.

MASIELLO

Meaning what?

BEN

(very carefully)

Meaning -- he -- fails to conform to

societal norms with respect to --

lawful behavior.

MASIELLO

I'm getting a fuckin' headache here.

73.

What are you saying?

BEN

He's got a -- criminal temperament.

MASIELLO

(stares at him)

He's a criminal? This is news? And

for that you need a doctor

degree? So what are you doin' with

him?

BEN

Well, I'm trying to at least show him

the possibility of change --

PATTY

Wrong.   You do not want him to change.

BEN

We haven't really been

introduced --

MASIELLO

This is Mrs. LoPresti.

PATTY

Patty.

BEN

Ben Sobel.

PATTY

Ben, Paul Vitti is important to this

family. We don't want to see you turn

him into a stromboni.

BEN

A stromboni? That thing they clean

the ice with at hockey games?

MASIELLO

That's a Zamboni, asshole.   Stromboni.

PATTY

It's a bull with his balls cut off.

BEN

(squeezed)

No, we don't want to do that.

74.

PATTY

Not unless you want to be one, too.

BEN

(in pain)

Me? No. I'm very attached to my

balls. As you can probably tell.

PATTY

(lets go)

Then do the right thing, understand?

BEN

(greatly relieved)

Yes, I understand completely. May I

go now? I have perishables --

CUT TO:

VITTI

We're gonna need a grapple or a crane

with maybe a fifty-foot boom.

MO-MO

I seen one -- in Bayonne -- but I'll

call around.

VITTI

See what you can come up with.   And

we're gonna need a city bus.

JELLY

I got a guy in the Transit Authority.

He owes me. Just let me know when.

PATTY (O.S.)

Paul!   Hello!

PATTY

I guess everybody's gone Hollywood,

huh?

VITTI

How you doin', Patty.

75.

PATTY

Jelly -- you're working here, too?

JELLY

I'm an extra.

PATTY

An extra what?

JELLY

A supernumerary. An 'atmosphere.' It

ain't bad. You just stand around all

day waitin' for them to shoot and they

pay you eighty bucks.

PATTY

Eighty bucks? For standin' around all

day? You used to sneeze eighty bucks.

How much you make shootin' craps?

JELLY

Today?   About eight hundred maybe.

PATTY

And how about bookin' bets for the

Teamsters and the crew?

JELLY

Another grand. One of the producers

really likes the ponies.

PATTY

So eighteen hundred bucks.

JELLY

Plus eighty --

PATTY

I know -- extra.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

This is a closed set. We're about to

start shooting.

EDDIE

Yeah?    So am I.

CUT TO:

76.

DRIVER

Should I wait here, Mr. Rigazzi?

RIGAZZI

No, pull the car up your ass and wait

there.

CUT TO:

PATTY

I heard you had some more trouble.

VITTI

One of Rigazzi's guys took a shot at

me.

PATTY

I don't have to tell you, Paul. Alone

on the street you don't stand a

chance. That's what the family's all

about. Since the old days, when the

grandfathers first came over. That's

not something you just walk away from.

VITTI

Yeah, I know. When you're a Jet,

you're a Jet all the way.

PATTY

So you want to tell me what's going on

here? It looks like you got your

whole crew back together.

VITTI

Nothing's going on.   They're actors.

PATTY

Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're

planning something. I'm feeling very

left out.

VITTI

(quietly)

Okay. Something big is going down,

but you're getting a cut. My hand to

God.

77.

PATTY

You're a good friend, Paul. And I

would never think of insisting on

this, but I'd feel better if you

brought in Eddie and some of my guys

to help with the job.

VITTI

I don't think so.

PATTY

Then I'll have to insist.

VITTI

Whatever.

RAOUL

Oh, dear God. First of all,

sweetheart, we're not shooting the

hooker scene until tomorrow. And the

hair -- please, what is that?

PATTY

Excuse me?

VITTI

Raoul, this is a friend of mine.

Patty LoPresti.

RAOUL

Mrs. LoPresti -- I am so very, very

RAOUL

How dare you not inform me Mrs.

LoPresti was on the set. You're

fired!

(to Patty)

Enjoy your visit with us. If there's

anything I can do --

PATTY

Go fuck yourself.

RAOUL

Immediately.

PATTY

It's good to have you back, Paul.

78.

(kisses Vitti on

the cheek)

We'll be in touch.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RAOUL

I mean, tell me -- was she angry?    Am

I in any danger?

VITTI

No, you're fine. But you might want

to have somebody else start your car

the next couple of weeks.

RAOUL

I'll have Brian do it.   He's new.

RIGAZZI

(to Vitti)

Could I talk to you for a second?

RAOUL

(eyeing Rigazzi)

Oh, what is this now, the bus and

truck tour of Guys and Dolls?

VITTI

This is Lou Rigazzi.

79.

RAOUL

(a horrified whisper)

'The Wrench.'

RAOUL (CONT'D)

(taking Rigazzi's

hand)

Please, forgive me. I'm on

painkillers -- half the time I don't

know what I'm saying.

RIGAZZI

Get lost.

RAOUL

Certainly.

(as he exits)

Brian! Get my car!

RIGAZZI

(to Vitti)

I need a couple minutes.

VITTI

(nodding)

This way.

CUT TO:

RIGAZZI

The guy who shot at you -- he was

acting on his own. I never gave an

order.

VITTI

Is that right?

RIGAZZI

And he's been taken care of. There

won't be another incident. Unless

you're thinkin' of workin' for Patty

LoPresti.

VITTI

Me?    No.

RIGAZZI

Good.    Then I got no beef with you.

80.

VITTI

Thanks.    I'll sleep much better.

RIGAZZI

Because   that would not be the way to

go. You    want to back a winner, which

is gonna   be me. It only makes sense.

You come   work for us. I'll treat you

right.

VITTI

I don't think so.

RIGAZZI

(a beat)

Well, so much for sleeping better.

CUT TO:

JELLY

Hey, Dr. Sobel?

BEN

Jelly, hi.

(recognizing some

of the others)

Hey! Yo-Yo!

JELLY

It's Mo-Mo.

BEN

Right. I was thinking of the cellist.

How's it going?

MO-MO

Goin' good. I did a 'Law and Order'

last week, I had a line on 'Sex and

the City' --

TUNA

I'm up for a recurring on 'NYPD Blue.'

BEN

That's great.    Have you seen Paul?

JELLY

Yeah, I think he's in his camper.

81.

BEN

His camper.

CUT TO:

VITTI

(surprised to see him)

Hey, Doc. What are you doing here?

BEN

No, what are   you doing here? I came

to tell you   we have a preliminary

meeting with   your parole officer and

who do I run   into? Patty LoPresti.

VITTI

Patty who?

BEN

What is this -- a knock-knock joke?

Patty-who-kidnapped-me-and-threatened-

to-cut-off-my-balls. Stop lying to

me, Paul. Your whole gang is here.

VITTI

Who says I'm lying? I finally    get a

straight job and start putting   my life

in order and you come in here   and

start accusing me! That's how    much

you trust me?

BEN

(off   balance)

It's not that   I don't trust you, I

just don't --   trust you.   Are you

lying to me?    Because I know you,

Paul. You'll    say or do anything to

get your own   way.

VITTI

This is what's so hard about being an

ex-con. You make one little mistake

in your life and people never let you

forget it.

BEN

Oh, so now you're the victim?    I want

the truth.

VITTI

Wait a second.    Say that again.

82.

BEN

Say what?

VITTI

'I want the truth.'   Say it -- like

you did just now.

BEN

I want the truth?

VITTI

No, strong, like before.

BEN

(forceful)

I want the truth!

VITTI

Yeah, that's good!

BEN

Paul --

VITTI

No, I'm serious. That had power. I

believed it. You could be an actor.

BEN

I'm not an actor --

VITTI

Hey, you're as good as most of the

bums I see around here. They have

this part. You could do it.

BEN

Actually, I did The Music Man in tenth

grade.

VITTI

Of course.   I'm gonna talk to Raoul.

BEN

About being on the show?   I couldn't -

-

VITTI

No, this part you could do.   It's

perfect. Believe me.

CUT TO:

83.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

We're rolling.

SOUNDMAN

Sound speed.

RAOUL

(shouts)

Action!

RAOUL

(doubtful)

Does that screaming sound real to you?

VITTI

Oh, yeah.    That sounds real.

CUT TO:

BEN

It's not funny! There was no safety

harness or anything. They could have

dropped me.

VITTI

Hey, if you didn't want to do it, why

didn't you say something?

BEN

I know exactly what that was about.

You resent the fact that you've been

put in my custody, so you passive-

aggressively arranged things to make

me look like a fool.

VITTI

Come on -- you were great.

BEN

(turning on a dime)

Really? I was scared at first, but on

the second take, I think I found some

good stuff. I was able to texture the

screaming --

84.

BEN

Oh, screw you, Paul.   Just screw you.

VITTI

What, are you self-medicating again?

And don't give that decongestant

multi-vitamin bullshit.

BEN

Don't worry about me. Just worry

about what you're going to say to this

parole officer. What are you going to

say? That you've moved out of my

house. That you've got your old gang

back together. For what, a high

school drop-out reunion?

VITTI

I'm gonna say that's none of his

fuckin' business.

BEN

It's my business. I want to know.

I'm a federal institution.

VITTI

(checks side-

view mirror)

You recognize that car?

BEN

Which car?

VITTI

The one that's been following us the

last mile and a half.

VITTI

Lose 'em.

BEN

What do you mean, 'lose 'em'?

CUT TO:

85.

CUT BACK TO:

BEN

Maybe I should just pull over.   It

could be the F.B.I.

VITTI

No, they're two cars back. You gotta

be a little more observant, Doc. Turn

left.

BEN

What if we just stop and get out?

They're not going to shoot us in broad

daylight.

VITTI

Broad daylight's the best time. You

can see better. Take a right. Now!

BEN

Sorry!

CUT BACK TO:

86.

CUT TO:

BEN

(frantic)

We can't do this, Paul!     We have to

stop! This is a lease!

BEN

(shouting back at

the Mercedes)

It's a goddamn lease!

VITTI

(looks back)

Move over. I'll drive.

BEN

Move over?   Where?

VITTI

Backseat.    Now!

BEN

Seat belt.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

87.

CUT TO:

VITTI

(determined)

Hang on.

BEN

It's gonna get worse?

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

BEN

They're right behind us!

(shouts at them)

Get away!

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

VITTI

What the fuck are you doing?

BEN

I wanted to save the crossword.

VITTI

Throw it!

88.

CUT TO:

BEN

(aghast)

You think they'll get out?

VITTI

Yeah, that's James Bond and the 'Sea

Hunt' guy in there, so they got a

pretty good shot.

BEN

Where're you going?

VITTI

I gotta take care of something.

BEN

But your parole officer --

VITTI

Send my regrets.

BEN

I'm warning you. If you leave now --

VITTI

So long, Doc.

89.

BEN

(calling after him)

That's it! I'm finished! You're on

your own now, pal! I'm --

BEN

(quietly)

-- screwed.

CUT TO:

CHAPIN

Where is he, Dr. Sobel?

BEN

I wish I knew.

CHAPIN

Well, considering that he's in your

custody, that's not quite the answer I

was looking for. He's got something

big in the works. You want to tell me

what you know?

BEN

I don't know anything. As far as I

can tell, he's making a real effort to

go straight.

CHAPIN

Yeah, that's why I've got two corpses

at the bottom of the river.

CHAPIN

Here. Vitti with Sal Masiello. Vitti

with Patty LoPresti. Vitti with Lou

Rigazzi. Let me know -- I can order

some wallet size for you. I've got

more than enough to put him away again

without these. Violation of parole,

second-degree murder here. When I

really start digging, it'll be amazing

90.

what I come up with. You have twenty-

four hours to find him and deliver him

to me. Otherwise you're looking at

obstruction of justice, and accessory

to felony manslaughter. And trust me,

Dr. Sobel, if you don't like me now,

you really don't want to see me in

court.

BEN

I'm getting that.   Can I go now?

CHAPIN

You can't take your car. We're

impounding it as evidence.

BEN

(exasperated)

Then can somebody give me a ride home?

CHAPIN

Yeah, the government runs a limousine

service. The number is 1-800-Fuck

Off.

CUT TO:

VITTI

I don't have a lot of time. They're

probably gonna come lookin' for me, so

we'll go over everything later, okay?

JELLY

Paul, not that I'm questioning, but

what do we want with Eddie DeVol?

Guy's a fuckin' scumbag.

VITTI

Look, I'm not happy about it, but if

it keeps Patty off my back, so be it.

They're meeting us at the club. Let's

head out.

(as they all get up)

Not all at once. I gotta tell you

everything?

91.

P.A.

Mr. Vitti? Mr. Bella asked if you

could meet him in the makeup trailer.

VITTI

No, I gotta go.

P.A.

He said it was important.

VITTI

(annoyed)

I'll talk to him tomorrow.

VITTI

Here -- tell him you couldn't find me.

CUT TO:

TONY BELLA

Paul!   Excellent!

VITTI

Can't really talk right now, mate.

Headin' out.

TONY BELLA

Two seconds. Please, Paul.    It's

really important.

CUT TO:

TONY BELLA

(script in hand)

I'm looking for something to do when

my character finds out he's being

indicted. I was thinking of punching

the wall, but I did that when they

killed Uncle Lenny, and I did it again

92.

when Franny left me. Oh, and I

punched a car, a van actually, when

Peezee screwed up the big drug deal.

So I'd like to find something

different, that doesn't involve, you

know, punching anything.

VITTI

Try kickin' something.   Let me know

how it works out.

TONY BELLA

Wait, Paul.   That's interesting.    Like

what?

VITTI

(impatient)

I don't know. You could kick a guy in

the face.

TONY BELLA

Who?

VITTI

(irritated)

Just some guy! You knock him down,

give him a couple quick kicks in the

head while he's on the ground.

TONY BELLA

Why?

VITTI

Why not? Because he's there and

you're pissed off.

TONY BELLA

You've done that?

VITTI

Maybe once or twice.   Look, I got

people waiting.

TONY BELLA

(thinks about it,

decides not)

My character wouldn't do that.   What

else?

VITTI

(at a loss, getting

angrier)

I don't know. You could yell real

loud?

93.

TONY BELLA

Yell real loud? That's original.

VITTI

(pops)

Or keep your fuckin' mouth shut! Who

gives a shit what you do, for cryin'

out loud?

TONY BELLA

(imitates him)

Who gives a shit what you do, for

cryin' out loud?

VITTI

What are you doin'?

TONY BELLA

What are you doin'?

VITTI

(irritated)

Okay, you can cut that shit out right

now.

TONY BELLA

Okay, you can cut that shit out right

now.

VITTI

(menacing)

Hey, I'm serious, asshole!

TONY BELLA

Hey, I'm serious, asshole!

CUT TO:

TONY BELLA

That was good.     My character could do

that.

CUT TO:

94.

BEN

(irritated)

Jelly!   Where's Paul?

BEN

Michael?   What are you doing?

MICHAEL

Working.

BEN

(pleasantly

surprised)

You got a job? That's great. Look

how handsome you look in that suit.

What's the job?

MICHAEL

(reluctantly)

I'm working for Mr. Vitti.   I'm his

driver.

BEN

Oh, no, you're not!

MICHAEL

You keep telling me to get a job!

BEN

I meant making sandwiches at the

Subway, not driving a getaway car!

MICHAEL

He's paying me twenty dollars an hour.

BEN

I don't care if he pays you two

hundred an hour, you're not doing it.

MICHAEL

Dad --

BEN

He had no right to ask you without my

permission. Where is he?

MICHAEL

I can't tell you.

BEN

What do you mean you can't tell me?

95.

MICHAEL

I promised I'd never repeat anything I

heard in the car. I took an oath.

BEN

You took an oath! Oh, my God!     Was

there blood involved?

MICHAEL

Dad, I gave my word.

LAURA

Ben? Where've you been?    What

happened to you?

BEN

(minimizing)

I was  in a car chase. There  was a

little  shooting -- not that much

really  -- then they -- drove into the

river.   It wasn't as bad as it sounds.

LAURA

When is this going to end?

BEN

Tonight, I hope. I just have to find

him and --

LAURA

Why? A few days ago you weren't even

sure you still wanted to be a

therapist. Now you're going to risk

your life again for that lout.

BEN

Yeah, but he's an amazing lout, isn't

he? I can't quit now. You know that.

LAURA

(relents)

Go.   Just don't get shot -- please?

BEN

I love you.

BEN

All right, where is he?

MICHAEL

I can't.

96.

LAURA

(pops)

You tell your father right now or I'll

give you such a smack it won't even be

funny!

MICHAEL

(surprised)

Okay!   I dropped him at the club.

BEN

What club?

MICHAEL

Little Darling's in Queens.

BEN

Okay, Mafiaboy, give me your car keys.

MICHAEL

I'm grounded?

BEN

No, I'm borrowing your car.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BEN

Jelly!

JELLY

(yelling over music)

Hey, Doc. What are you doin' here?

BEN

Where's Paul?

JELLY

I think she likes you, Doc.     Give her

a couple of bucks.

BEN

Can you break a twenty?

BEN

Do I just make my own change?

BEN

(calls to her)

A ten and five ones -- when you have

the chance.

BEN

Okay, Paul, what's going on?

98.

VITTI

(keyed up)

What are you doing here?

BEN

I could ask you the same thing.

VITTI

What's it look like? We're just

blowin' off a little steam. What's

the big deal?

EDDIE

How's it goin', Paulie? You know my

guys -- Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino?

VITTI

(looks at him)

Al Pacino? That's your real name?

AL PACINO

No. People call me that because I

look like Al Pacino.

(beat)

The actor.

VITTI

Anybody ever call you Carol Burnett?

AL PACINO

No.   Why?

VITTI

'Cause you look about as much like

Carol Burnett as you look like Al

Pacino.

BEN

I do see a little Pacino there --

around the eyes.

EDDIE

So we're all here. Let's do it.

BEN

(stops Vitti)

Let's do what?

99.

VITTI

You better get out of here.

BEN

(lays a hand

on his arm)

I'm not going until you tell me what's

going on here.

VITTI

(menacing)

Don't make me hurt you.    Get the fuck

out of here.

CUT TO:

VITTI

Okay, this is big and we only get one

shot at it; and there's only about a

million ways this fuckin' thing can go

bad, so listen up.

VITTI

The Federal Gold Depository in Lower

Manhattan. Three times a year a

shipment of gold bars goes in a

heavily-guarded armored truck from the

Depository to the vault at the Federal

Reserve to hold for foreign

governments that trade in bullion. At

three o'clock in the morning -- eight

hours from now --we're gonna hijack

that truck.

CUT TO:

100.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

EDDIE

What the fuck is this?

ENORMOUS BOBBY

I found this guy listening at the

door.

BEN

(dazed)

Hey, guys. How's it going?

EDDIE

Who is this guy?

BEN

(not looking

at Eddie)

Ben Sobel. Sorry, I can't move my

head to the right. Boy, I hope that's

not permanent.

EDDIE

Get rid of him.

BEN

(still dazed)

Hi, Carol.

AL PACINO

You're a dead man, asshole.    Let's go.

101.

VITTI

What are you doing?

EDDIE

What do you think? He can make every

guy in this room.

BEN

Oh, I'm not into that, fellas.

VITTI

Get your fuckin' hands off him!   He's

with me.

EDDIE

What, on the job?

EDDIE

(impatiently)

Either he's in, or he's dead.    Which

is it?

BEN

I think in is better.

VITTI

(reluctantly)

He's in. He's my responsibility.

EDDIE

(to Vitti)

Okay, no more surprises. And from

this moment on, no one leaves my

sight. Got it? Now go through it one

more time.

VITTI

Okay -- everybody listen up.

BEN

Wait!

(sits)

Okay.    Go ahead.

CUT TO:

102.

CERRONE

(yawns, checks watch)

I wonder what it costs to keep that

many limos waiting for three-and-a-

half hours.

Everybody stand by. They're leaving.

Where's Vitti?   I don't see Vitti.

CERRONE

Damn it!

103.

(grimly, into radio)

Call it off. We lost them.

CUT TO:

JELLY

Here. See if this'll fit under your

shirt.

BEN

(extremely nervous)

I could fit you under my shirt.    Don't

they have anything smaller?

JELLY

This ain't Bloomingdale's. Nobody

knew you were comin'. You're lucky

you're alive, Doc.

BEN

(hisses)

Nobody's going to be alive when this

is over. What kind of plan is this?

It's crazy. It's stupid!

JELLY

Watch it. It may be crazy but it

ain't stupid. If you want to stay

alive, just keep your mouth shut, do

everything I tell you and try not to

pee in your pants.

(quietly)

Can you handle an M-16?

BEN

You mean shoot it?

JELLY

No, I mean twirl it like a fuckin'

baton. How about an A.K.?

104.

BEN

(exasperated)

Jelly --

JELLY

(rummaging through

pile)

Kalashnikov, MAC-10, Uzi -- stop me if

I hit one you like.

BEN

Couldn't I just take this?

JELLY

Yeah, that's a good one. That gun

brings back a lot of fond memories.

Use it in good health.

BEN

(winces)

Ooh, cold -- cold.

BEN

(explaining)

My gun -- fell down in my --

VITTI

(to Jelly)

Check the bus.

VITTI

(quietly, to   Ben)

If we can, I'm gonna   get you out

before the real shit   goes down. Just

don't flip out on me,   okay?

105.

BEN

You are making a huge mistake.   You

know that, don't you?

VITTI

You said it yourself.   It's my nature.

BEN

It's not your nature!   You have a

choice.

VITTI

What are you, fucking Jiminy Cricket?

I don't know what planet you live on,

but here on Earth it's 'might makes

right.'   Read the papers. The guys

with the guns make the rules.

BEN

(holding up the

pistol)

So I guess that makes me a real man

now.  What happened to the white hat,

Paul?  Your father wasn't wrong. You

could be one of the good guys.

VITTI

Enough. Say one more word about my

father and I'll break your fuckin'

head.

BEN

(quietly)

Okay.

I have five to three. They should

I have three-o-six.

Let's see your watch.

Go!

Shit!   Ow!

VITTI

(shouts)

Get the ramp!

EDDIE

(very excited)

You know, this might just fuckin'

work.

You're gonna get in so much trouble.

CUT TO:

LIEUTENANT

They can't get over the wire.

CAPTAIN

Then knock down the gates!

CUT TO:

VITTI

(pops his head in)

Forty bars. That's all we need.

BEN

How much is that?

VITTI

$350 an ounce, 16 ounces in a pound,

90 pounds in each bar -- do the math.

JELLY

(a beat)

Actually, gold is measured in troy

ounces. 14.6 ounces to the pound.

That would be... $18,396,000.

BEN

Really?

JELLY

Give or take.

110.

BEN

Well, so much for not peeing in my

pants.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BEN

You know what you said about not

flipping out?

VITTI

Yeah?

BEN

Sorry.

(flipping out)

What did I do? What did I do? I had

a perfect life, I threw it away.

VITTI

Don't do this.

BEN

I can't help it! My life is over!

I'm going to jail. Some people

can handle prison -- I'm not one of

them. I have delicate features. I'm

small. I'll be way too popular!

VITTI

Calm down.

BEN

I can't calm down!      I'm gonna die!

VITTI

You're not gonna die!

111.

BEN

I can't breathe! I'm suffocating!

VITTI

(shaking him)

For Chrissake, get hold of yourself!

BEN

I can't!   I'm dying!   We're all going

to die!

BEN

Did I just hit you?

VITTI

Yeah.   Feel better now?

BEN

(breaking down)

I'm sorry, Paul. I blame myself for

this. I wanted to help you. I wanted

to be there for you. But I just

wasn't good enough.

VITTI

You were good.  It isn't your fault.

BEN

No, it is. Since my father

died --

(starts crying)

I've lost my way. I don't know

anything anymore. I mean, what's the

point? I didn't think it would hit me

so hard --

VITTI

Would you just shut up about your

father!

BEN

I'm grieving, goddammit!    Have a

little respect!

VITTI

He was an asshole -- you said it

yourself. What are you grieving for?

BEN

I'm grieving for myself, you fucking

idiot!

112.

VITTI

(surprised, shrugs)

Jeez, I'm sorry.

BEN

Now I know how you must have felt when

your father was killed.

BEN

(crying more)

I mean, it had to be ten times worse

for you -- being murdered right in

front of you. And you were so young -

-

VITTI

We don't have time for this.

BEN

(really sobbing)

It must've been so painful!

VITTI

(eyes filling with

tears)

I'm warning you -- don't do

this --

BEN

I mean, it's like all his hopes for

you died with him. And that's so sad.

VITTI

(starting to cry)

There I go. You happy now?      You see

what you're doing here?

BEN

Your father really loved you.

VITTI

I loved him, too. I did.

BEN

(hugs him)

I know. I know.

JELLY

Oh, boy.    This is bad.

113.

JELLY

Maybe we oughta should go.

EDDIE

Did you really think you were gonna

live through this?

VITTI

I had my hopes.

EDDIE

Yeah, well, nice work.   Mr. Rigazzi

will be very grateful.

BEN

(to Vitti)

Rigazzi? I thought he worked for

Patti LoPresti.

VITTI

That's what Patty thought, too. This

scumbag's been playin' both sides

against the middle.

EDDIE

There's only one side as far as I'm

concerned. Mine. What did you think?

I was just gonna stand by and let some

fuckin' has-been move back in? So

long, Mr. Vitti.

BEN

(beating the shit

out of Eddie)

I can't take it anymore! That's what

I hate about you fucking sociopaths!

You just keep changing the rules to

suit yourselves. Well, not this time,

you anti-social asshole. You fucked

with the wrong shrink!

BEN

Don't you read the papers?   The guy

114.

with the gun makes the rules.

VITTI

Yeah, what?

CUT TO:

CAPTAIN

(screaming)

On the floor! Face-down!   Now!

AL PACINO

(to Eddie)

Nice goin'. Good plan.

ENORMOUS BOBBY

What's a sociopath?

SWAT LEADER

They're escaping out the back!    Get

over there! Move it!

Freeze! Drop your weapons!

RAOUL (O.S.)

(on his own bullhorn)

Cut, cut, cut! What the hell's going

on?

RAOUL

(to the Captain)

Who are you? What are you doing in my

shot?

CAPTAIN

What are you doing on my street?

RAOUL

I have a permit!

CAPTAIN

I don't give a shit about your permit!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

All right, people. Back to one and

let's try it again!

(into his walkie-talkie)

Release the traffic and reset for

another take.

CUT TO:

BEN

(sees them coming)

That's it. We're screwed.

LEAD SWAT

You!

BEN

Yes, Officer?

LEAD SWAT

You're one tough shrink.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BEN

Feeling pretty good, huh?

VITTI

I felt worse.

BEN

So what now? You go on the run for

the rest of your life? Back to Sing

Sing? Or you turn up dead in an alley?

VITTI

Those are my choices? What   happened

to lying on a beach in Costa  Rica

for the next twenty years?   You

can't let me enjoy this for  five

fuckin' minutes?

117.

BEN

Five minutes?    And then what?

VITTI

And then what?    I'll show you.

CUT TO:

CHAPIN

Acting on intelligence we developed in

the last few days, the Justice

Department and the F.B.I. took very

aggressive action to recover the

stolen gold and bring the perpetrators

to justice. I'm happy to tell the

people of New York that the streets

are safe again.

CUT TO:

PATTY

Hi, Paul.   How'd it go?

VITTI

Not so good.

PATTY

Yeah, I heard. It's all over the

television. I never should've trusted

Eddie. But, you know, a woman alone

in the world is very vulnerable.

VITTI

Yeah, I know.

PATTY

At least I don't have to worry about

the Rigazzis no more. Thanks to you.

VITTI

I told you -- I just want to be left

118.

alone.

PATTY

I know. I'll make sure. How about

some breakfast? I could make you some

waffles and -- whatever else you want.

VITTI

Can't do that.

PATTY

Well, if you ever change your mind --

(kisses him)

Good luck, Paul.

CUT TO:

BEN

Did you see Patti?

VITTI

Yeah.

BEN

(ruefully)

Did she grab your balls?

VITTI

What kind of question is that? She's

cool. She's just happy to have 'the

Wrench' out of the way.

BEN

Well, I talked to the U.S. Attorney.

VITTI

Did he grab your balls?

BEN

No, Paul, he did not grab my balls.

He thanked me for tipping him off

about the gold. And he said he won't

be coming after you if you stay out of

trouble.  So what do you think?

VITTI

I'm gonna go to Ohio -- get Marie and

the kids -- then we'll probably

disappear for awhile -- figure out all

119.

this future stuff

-- away from all the pressure.

BEN

Good idea. Change is hard, Paul.    But

you did the right thing.

VITTI

Yeah, you, too. You hung in there.

That took a lot of guts.

BEN

Well, I just --

VITTI

No, you were like an animal back

there.

BEN

I just vented my displaced aggression

VITTI

No. I'm telling you. You're a

monster. I saw the beast in you.

BEN

I'm not a beast. I can handle myself

if I have to --

VITTI

Handle yourself? You were fuckin'

John Wayne.

BEN

Well, I wrestled a bit in high school

-- 122 pounds.

VITTI

Yeah, I could tell.   You're good, you.

BEN

I'm not --

VITTI

Paul, I just --

VITTI

No. You are good. You got a gift, my

friend.

BEN

Fine.   I have a gift.

VITTI

So -- happy ending, huh?

120.

BEN

Well, I think so.   Don't you feel

better now?

VITTI

Are you kidding? I feel like shit.

All that work for nothing. 20 million

bucks.

BEN

You're grieving -- it's a process.

VITTI

Take it easy, Doc.

BEN

You, too, Paul.

VITTI

Hey, Doc!

'There's a place for us -- '

Somehow, someday, somewhere.'
