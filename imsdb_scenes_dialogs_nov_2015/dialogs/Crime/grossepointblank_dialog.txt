MAY 4, 1994

MARTIN

Hooked it.

CLUB MEMBER #1

I'd come to the realization that

everything I'd based my life on was

false. And that my life had no

meaning.

CLUB MEMBER #2

(to Martin)

He gets this way when he hits over

eighty-five.

CLUB MEMBER #1

It seemed like my life was slipping

away, somehow. I was a knot in the

middle of a wet rope. Everything was

futile and nothing had value.

CLUB MEMBER #3

That's the way life is. The only

meaning and value is what we create.

Through structure, and discipline.

Though they seem to limit our freedom,

they actually give us great comfort.

Your problem is you're looking for

some great answer. Some ultimate

truth. When what you really should

do is go to work and go home.

CLUB MEMBER #2

And take golf lessons.

CLUB MEMBER #1

That's a tragedy. Can I finish my

story please? I began my search for

meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew,

Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I

went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist,

herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman,

and a psychic. And they all pretty

much say the same stuff.

CLUB MEMBER #2

A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are

telling you the same thing? You're

insane.

CLUB MEMBER #1

Basically the same thing. In a very

evolved, esoteric way.

CLUB MEMBER #2

Insane.

CLUB MEMBER #1

To make a long story short...

CLUB MEMBER #3

--Thank God--

CLUB MEMBER #1

...at last I found the holistic system

of systems that opened up the doors

of heaven for me right here on earth.

And everyday I see the world through

the eyes of a child. A world of

creation and wonder.

CLUB MEMBER #2

Jesus...

CLUB MEMBER #1

Overflowing with love.

MARTIN

Tell me about it.

CLUB MEMBER #1

P.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the

secrets of your universe are divided

up into eight easily digestible

slices.

CLUB MEMBER #1

See, see. It's in the accessible and

everyday shape of a pan pizza. Each

day you have a little slice of

peace...

MARTIN

Oh I see. You got your individual

slices of hope, dignity, confidence,

self-love, justice, and harmony.

CLUB MEMBER #1

You open 'em up and there's the

sayings, stories, little bites of

insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day

Week.

MARTIN

So you eat-- read it everyday?

CLUB MEMBER #1

Yes.

MARTIN

And these pan pizzas have opened up

the doors to heaven?

CLUB MEMBER #1

Correct.

(re: the card)

That's for you. Keep it.

MARTIN AT CAR

He fishes out the laminated "Personal

Pan Power" card, looks at it, and

tosses it onto the ground. Police

cars, now visible in the distance,

wind into the long club driveway.

Martin gets into his car and pulls

away.

DRIVER

How was your day, today, sir?

MARTIN

Effective. But to tell you the truth,

I've lost my passion for work.

DRIVER

Do you like the people you work with?

MARTIN

I work alone.

DRIVER

That's it then. That's it. I've always

been alone. That's why I'm a good

driver. I can handle it. See, I can

think on my feet. I survive, I'm a

thinker. And I can sit there in front

of your house for two hours and it

don't bother me. Some people can't

do it! Some people are ranting and

raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to

get out here and get in this car, I

can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna

go? You're gonna wind up back in

your garage at seven o'clock at night.

You ain't going nowhere. You leave

your house in the morning you get

back to your house in the evening.

What's the big deal, right?

MARTIN

You understand the psychology of the

job.

DRIVER

I do. Some guys can't adjust to it;

they can't handle it.

DRIVER

You look like you're far away. Far

away and thinking about other things.

I'm right about that, aren't I?

MARTIN

No.

DRIVER

Well, let's just say that sometimes

I'm right. Sometimes you are.

MARTIN

Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only

natural.

DRIVER

(laughs to himself at

this great truth)

It's only natural....

DRIVER

I been looking at you, and I've

decided that I want to share something

with you.

MARTIN

Okay.

DRIVER

Because your problem is you're bored.

And you have a very big mind.

(beat)

I am part of what I call a brain

syndicate.

DRIVER

I am part of a network of minds, a

group of five people who are all

connected, over hundreds, even

thousands of miles, through the mind.

We can think with each other, think

for each other. I can be driving

somewhere, sleeping with a woman--

whatever it is-- and at the same

time be thinking a thought in someone

else's mind, far away. Running someone

else's brain.

MARTIN

(indicates)

Up on the right.

DRIVER

And when you think of it, it's not

so surprising that a small group of

people control the whole world, is

it?

MARTIN

If it's not there, I can't proceed.

Tell them.

MARTIN

Tom. I've been waiting for an answer.

I'm only in town tonight.

MARTIN

What's different this time than the

last time? I have to be down front...

MARTIN

...I don't bother to call anyone

else because you always take care of

me.

MARTIN

Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands

full here.

MARTIN

Good. Account number 3649367, transfer

to account number 96-546-38739-47825.

Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's

Mr. Duckman. If there are any

problems, access file 673594638-IO-

98, and look at it.

MARTIN

Sorry Tom. But look, I know it's the

playoffs. That's why I'm offering a

thousand dollars for one seat...

MARTIN

...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do

I have to do to get courtside tickets

for the Knicks...?

MARTIN

Never mind. I gotta go.

MARTIN

...Tell them that's not my problem.

I was paid for one job-- the cyclist--

not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.

MARCELLA

Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.

MARTIN

Patch him through....

MARTIN

What do you want?

GROCER

I'm setting up a concern that would

enable those of us in our rarefied

profession to consolidate our efforts.

MARTIN

Like a union?

GROCER

Like a club. Work less, make more.

MARTIN

Thank you, no.

GROCER

We could be working together, making

big money, killing important people...

I'm willing to let you in on the

ground floor.

MARTIN

And you could be... sort of like...

a father figure to me....

GROCER

It's a free-market evolution. You'll

wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used

to run together when you were a

rookie. I don't want to run against

you. This thing's real. Everybody's

in.

MARTIN

Not me. So don't paw at me with your

dirty little guild.

GROCER

I'm gonna get you, kid.

WOMAN (V.O.)

"Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's

been ten years? Where are you now...?

WOMAN (V.O.)

...Are you guiding an Outward Bound

canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or

perhaps in charge of appearances for

the NFL like Leslie Gunther....?

WOMAN (V.O.)

...Could it be that you're like Chip

Longfellow, at the trade-relations

tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser

owns a cheese shop...!

WOMAN (V.O.)

...Looking at yearbooks and pictures

evokes so many memories...!

MARTIN (V.O.)

(hushed)

Fuck!

WOMAN (V.O.)

...Some good. Some bad. But all

interesting...

MARTIN

Freeze! Police!

WOMAN (V.O.)

...As a graduate of the class of

1984, you are someone special...

WOMAN (V.O.)

...Whenever news of you filters back,

the school is excited and proud of

your accomplishments...

WOMAN (V.O.)

...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared

you well to lead the kind of life

that makes an impact on the world...

WOMAN (V.O.)

...Remember, "there's no where you

can go that you haven't learned how

to go in time... It's easy..."

HUSKY MAN

(in severe pain)

Whatever it is that I'm doing that

you don't like I'll stop doing it.

MARTIN

It's not me.

MARCELLA

...So come on back to the old oak

tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion

committee."

MARTIN

Throw that away.

MARCELLA

This?

MARTIN

Don't tease me. You know what I do

for a living.

MARCELLA

It's from one of those P.O. Boxes.

How was the trip?

MARTIN

Tedious. I now authorize you to throw

away all personal mail.

MARCELLA

All of it?

MARTIN

And not show it to me. Ever again.

MARCELLA

That's going to cost.

MARTIN

I'll pay.

MARCELLA

They're not happy, sir.

MARTIN

I'm not happy.

MARCELLA

They say their friend was suppose to

have a heart attack and die in his

sleep.

MARTIN

He didn't.

MARCELLA

They blame you for the compromise.

MARTIN

And they want me to make up for it.

MARCELLA

In Detroit. This weekend.

MARTIN

Tell them that's impossible. I need

my normal lead time.

MARCELLA

They were very upset.

MARTIN

Would you describe their position as

inflexible?

MARCELLA

Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

MARCELLA

And sir, I also get that broken-

mirror, black-cat, Friday-the-

thirteenth kind of feeling about

this one....

MARTIN

There's nothing to be done about it.

MARCELLA

I liquidated the last account in

Zurich, and split it into two new

ones in Estonia.

MARTIN

Good. What else? Anything interesting?

MARCELLA

Mmm, not really. But you're gonna

love this one.

MARCELLA

Enough?

MARTIN

Never enough.

MARCELLA

But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be

so easy.

MARTIN

I have scruples. Next.

MARCELLA

Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's

a full dossier. Very comprehensive.

MARCELLA

(off-screen)

You should get going....

MARCELLA

Don't forget your identity.

MARTIN

See you next week.

MARTIN

Tell Dr. Oatman I'm on my way.

DR. OATMAN (V.O.)

Why don't you want to go to your

high school reunion?

MARTIN

It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do

I have in common with those people?

Or with anyone?

DR. OATMAN

You went to school with these people.

MARTIN

Come on.

DR. OATMAN

We've spent a lot of time discussing

those years. Remember we said that

fear is a transfer of the bodily

hurt associated by experience with

the thing feared, to the thought of

the thing. Thus we fear a dog without

distinctly imagining its bite.

MARTIN

Shouldn't you be taking notes?

DR. OATMAN

Tell me about your vision of the

reunion.

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

MARTIN

It'll be depressing.

DR. OATMAN

How do you know?

MARTIN

I just know.

DR. OATMAN

Say more.

MARTIN

They'll have husbands and wives and

children and houses and dogs....

made themselves a part of something.

And they can talk about what they

do. What am I going to say?

(sarcastic)

"I killed the President of Paraguay

with a fork."

DR. OATMAN

You needn't be so frank with me about

your work.

MARTIN

Why not. I trust you. You couldn't

turn me in because of Doctor-Patient

privilege... and I don't want to be

"withholding"... and I know where

you live.

DR. OATMAN

You know where I live?

MARTIN

We're both professionals, Oatman.

DR. OATMAN

I think what you fear Martin is

domesticity. It's the greatest fear

that men have who belong to Western

Culture. It's centuries old. Like

King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th

century who decided one day that he

was so bored with his dreary life at

home with his wife he thought, "Well,

wouldn't it be great if we hit the

road and fought... oh... the

Saracens."  So he put the word out

and was amazed when a million men

signed up and all of them wanted to

go and fight in distant lands and do

terrible things to people rather

than stay at home with their families.

MARTIN

So you're saying that Ulysses--

everything he said to his queen when

he came back--everything was a lie?

He just wanted to fuck around?

DR. OATMAN

Yes.

MARTIN

Mmm.

DR. OATMAN

And how have you been feeling about

your... work lately?

MARTIN

Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's

just getting hard to go to work in a

good mood. I'm starting to think

I've been in the business too long.

Last week I did a guy younger than

me.

MARTIN (V.O.)

The church seems to be purging itself

of it's pedophile.

MARTIN (V.O.)

It's a bull market.

MARTIN (V.O.)

Anyway, that never use to happen. I

was always the prodigy. Now I'm just

one of the guys.

DR. OATMAN (V.O.)

Maybe some of the discomfort you're

feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over

the innocent people you've killed.

MARTIN

If I show up at your door, chances

are you did something to bring me

there. I don't care about that stuff,

anyway.

DR. OATMAN

What stuff?

MARTIN

(dismissive)

Morality.

DR. OATMAN

Go to your reunion, Martin. See those

people and discover what they mean

to you. Try not to kill anybody for

a few days, see how you feel.

MARTIN

If I get antsy I'll kill a few small

animals.

OATMAN

Now we're making progress.

CAT

Meow.

MARTIN

Just a minute.

CAT

Meow!

MARTIN

Food soon...

MARTIN

Tuna or liver?

CAT

Meow.

MARTIN

Tuna it is.

LARDNER

You always say that. You always say

that. I'm telling you, you never met

the man.

MCCULLERS

Seventeen months ago I was posting a

walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He

never saw me. But I saw him, though.

LARDNER

Lisbon?

MCCULLERS

In Portugal, yes.

LARDNER

Here's the news: He hasn't been in

Portugal since '90. I know that from

the file. Why don't you read the

file, man?

MCCULLERS

In fact, I think I talked with him,

in Bonn.

LARDNER

You always say that. You always have

to know everybody. Why don't I just

take the weekend off and let you

kill him. Since you two are so close.

FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)

(on radio)

--this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the

time. Oldies from the eighties. It's

a cold summer day in Grosse Pointe--

CUT TO:

FEMALE DEEJAY

--and I'm ready for some good tunes

and angry talk. Or angry tunes and

good talk--

CUT TO:

FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)

--Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau

Twins and get over the goo-angry-

talking music. As you know--

CUT TO:

FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)

--for some moments in life there are

no words, and a little nonsense now

and then is relished by the wisest

man--

FEMALE DEEJAY

--The Cocteau Twins, though also a

band of the nineties, will be aired

due to the fact that they created

their own language to sing by--

CUT TO:

DEBI

--Now that's freedom--

DEBI

--The best I can do is a rhyme: Where

are all the good men dead? In the

heart or in the head? Back later....

MARTIN

What are you doing here?

CARL

A double shift. What's it look like?

(softening)

Can I help you with something?

MARTIN

I don't think so.

MARTIN

(into phone)

Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick

up if you're there... It's Martin

Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not

here. My house is gone and now there's

a 7-11 here... And that's

unfortunate... You can never go home

again, Dr. Oatman.

MARTIN

(to himself)

But I guess you can shop there.

NURSE

Mary, your son's here.

MARY

I bought a new rug.

MARTIN

That's wonderful, Mom.

MARY

What's a revival tent?

MARTIN

It's a place where religious people--

MARY

(knowingly)

Marlin Perkins and Jim!

MARTIN

Jim?

MARY

His assistant. He acted like Marlin's

son, only he wasn't. At least they

never said he was... I bet they were

lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers.

Wild Kingdom my ass!

MARTIN

It's good to see you. I'm sure you're

curious about what I've been doing.

MARY

I spoke to your father the other

day.

MARTIN

I imagine that'd be rather difficult.

MARY

Nature made him then broke the mold.

MARTIN

They told me you're taking lithium,

mom.

MARY

Yes, they give me headaches. I have

a headache.

MARTIN

You have a headache?

MARY

I have a headache. You have a

headache?

MARTIN

No, I don't have one.

MARY

You don't have a headache. I have a

headache.

MARY

We had a good laugh, didn't we?

MARTIN

Yeah. I guess we did.

MARY

Why don't you return this car and

borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to

the rent-a-car so you can get a ride

back.

MARTIN

I think I'll go see Debi today.

MARY

Of course you will.

MARTIN

I can't think of anything to say to

her that seems appropriate given I

left and never said goodbye to her.

MARY

Take care of her. She's a keeper.

MARTIN

Yeah...

MARY

And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro

on foreign exchange?

MARTIN

I have always thought about her and

missed her.

MARY

Separate the wheat from the chaff

and you've got the candle cat.

MARY

Remember no matter how impossible

your problems feel. I've known people

without a chance in the world. And

all of a sudden, they have lives.

Time allows miracles. Let yourself

breathe, son.

MARTIN

Mom...

MARY

"What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/

What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/

Hey! Look out!  You're gonna hurt

someone,/ with that old shotgun,/

Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/

We really mean it!"

MARY

Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's

your name?

MARTIN

Hey Pop... You got off easy. The

house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho-

pharmacological punching bag and I

murder for cash. If you were here I

think you'd be proud.

MARTIN

pries out a wall vent, slides in the

case and replaces the vent.

MCCULLERS

"...Against the wind... just a young

man running... Against the wind...

let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on

it the thuuunder! Night moves..."

DEBI

(on air, groping)

WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time.

Oldies from the eighties. That was

ah... the Specials. Doing... one of

their songs...

DEBI

...and here's another.

MARTIN

"Oldies from the eighties?"

DEBI

I just play my own collection.

MARTIN

It's nice to see you again.

MARTIN

How long has it been?

DEBI

Since you stood me up on prom night

and vanished without saying a word?

MARTIN

Ten years, I think. What I miss?

DEBI

Well, let me see... they tore down

the George Orwell monument and put

up a bust of George Michael. Main

Street's a four-laner, no left turns

four to seven. I was married and

divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now

officially the new sister city to

Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have

fiber-optic town meetings every two

months.

MARTIN

Here is now there. There is here.

DEBI

Those are the headlines.

DEBI

Hold that thought.

(into phone)

WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl,

all the...

(pauses)

No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years.

DEBI

Tell me about yourself.

MARTIN

I'm in California most of the time.

Traveling a lot on business. That's

about it, really.

DEBI

That's it?

MARTIN

Not much else.

DEBI

What's your business?

MARTIN

I'm a professional killer.

DEBI

Professional killer. Do you get dental

with that?

MARTIN

Well, I'm in town for a few days,

anyway.

MARTIN

Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.

DEBI

Okay.

DEBI

(into mike)

A man comes to you. He is from the

past bringing you pain long since

put behind you. He says peculiar

things and leaves abruptly. It all

comes flooding back...

DEBI

It felt like an apparition, or some

cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time

warp I'd been thrust back into without

warning. There's a strangeness in

the air and I don't mind telling

you, I'm a little spooked. He was a

man from my past. A man I loved. A

man who disappeared.

DEBI

A man who's walking back into the

station.

LARDNER

Well?

MCCULLERS

I don't think so.

LARDNER

Well, remember when Frysal's men

paid off the Deejay in Cairo to

announce a bogus press conference in

the --

MCCULLERS

--Nooo--

LARDNER

--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in

'72. A local radio station started

broadcasting news of the massacre

two minutes before it happened.

MCCULLERS

That's strictly Baader-Meinhof stuff.

LARDNER

It was the PLO.

MCCULLERS

Whatever.

DEBI

Sit.

DEBI

All right mystery man. I want some

answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84.

Two young lovers with frightening

natural chemistry. The girl sits in

a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at

her father's house waiting for the

most romantic night of her young

life. The boy never shows up, until

now. So, what's the question?

MARTIN

Where have I been?

DEBI

More like what happened? What

happened, Mr. Blank?

MARTIN

I don't know exactly. I could venture

a guess but it would sound like a

rationalization... I thought you

know... maybe seeing you, some

friends, my house... of course now a

7-11--

DEBI

--Torn down in the name of convenience--

MARTIN

--and I guess, sure, seeing you would

be part of that whole equation... I

suppose the most important thing,

really. I don't know. Anyway, this

whole thing's my therapist's idea.

It's my shrink, really.

DEBI

Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?

MARTIN

You see someone?

DEBI

Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade

later, and you want to sort things

out with me. The question now is, do

I allow you... access... to my being?

DEBI

All right then. Would you like to

share any more deeply personal

thoughts with our listening audience

before we go to our phone poll and

see how the folks in radioland come

down on this one?

DEBI

Should a broken-hearted girl give a

guy a second chance at love....

DEBI

(HARD)

You're on the air.

OLD WOMAN'S VOICE

I think this young man has avoided

the question completely. Has not

discussed "what happened" nor if

he's sorry for what he has done.

Therefore, I don't see any reason

why you should see him until he fully

discloses his intentions and feelings.

DEBI

Thank you caller.

DEBI

You're on the air.

DUMB GUY VOICE

Are you there?

DEBI

Yes.

DUMB GUY VOICE

No, the guy.

MARTIN

Yeah....

DUMB GUY VOICE

Uh... when you guys use to go out...

Did you guys ever... heh heh heh

heh... ever fuckin', ever totally

fuckin' heh heh heh-

DEBI

Next caller.

GUFF MAN VOICE

I don't know, Debi. Sounds like bad

gas to me. I would not allow him

access to your being.

DEBI

Thank you.

DEBI

Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you

loud and clear: "If you love something

set it free. If it comes back to you

it's, well...

DEBI

...Broken...."

MARTIN

Dammit. Never trust my instincts.

PAUL

(grinning ear-to-ear)

Hell, I would've voted for you, but

there's all this apple sauce stuck

in my phone... I don't wanna talk

about it. How the hell are you?!

(extends his hand)

Here's five good ones!

PAUL

Marty! It's me. Paul.

MARTIN

(realizing)

Paul?

PAUL

(re: hand)

You're leaving me hanging here...

PAUL

Hey. Give me a break.

PAUL

This won't take but a minute. I just

gotta hold their hands for a final

walk-through. I'll take them in, get

'em out, then you and I can grab a

little quality time.

PAUL

Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was

afraid you joined a cult or something.

I half-expected you to come back to

town in a fennel wreath and paper

pants.

MARTIN

There was no money in it.

MARTIN

(grinning)

So what happened to you?

PAUL

Same thing that happened to you-- I

stopped poutin' there on the

sidelines. Got in. Got on the team.

I joined the working week, you slick

fucking asshole, so why don't you

valet park your high horse and take

it easy on your old buddy, Paul.

MARTIN

Fair enough.

PAUL

God it's great to see you.

MARTIN

You too.

SOUTHTEC GUARD (V.O.)

Well, we do what we have to do if we

find you on the property. But we

don't really enforce the law, we

execute company policy for homeowners.

MARTIN

So when are you authorized to use

deadly force?

SOUTHTEC GUARD

Well, a 'course, taxes provide your

basic service-- police and whatnot.

But our customers need a little more

than just that, you understand? This

badge doesn't mean that I am a peace

officer.

MARTIN

So it's not a meaningful symbol, or

anything. That badge is just the

badge of your company. If I look

suspicious on your customers' property--

well, under those heightened

circumstances you have the authority

to, ah... To shoot me.

SOUTHTEC GUARD

To shoot you. Correct.

MARTIN

How did you get this job?

SOUTHTEC GUARD

Well, they were hiring, and it was

only a two week course...

MARTIN

(pleasantly)

Wow.

PAUL

(to couple)

...What more can I say.

HUSBAND

(smiling)

We'll talk soon.

PAUL

(much hand gesturing)

You'll be raising your new family in

a work of art. A work of art in a

work of art.

SOUTHTEC GUARD

I'm sure you'll be very happy.

MARTIN

(heartfelt)

When my time comes, if it ever does,

I want a beautiful, normal place

like this... and a wife like you...

MARTIN

...and you'll be safe here...

PAUL

Now. I don't make a habit of pimping

my friends, but there is one prime

little piece of land that you must

see...

MARTIN (V.O.)

Debi's house.

PAUL (V.O.)

Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?

MARTIN

No. You drove us here.

PAUL

Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie,

isn't it?

MARTIN

No.

PAUL

Ten years. What happened!?

MARTIN

I freaked out, joined the Army, worked

for the government, and went into

business for myself... I'm a

professional killer.

PAUL

Thank you.

PAUL

Professional killer, huh? Does that

come with a good HMO?

"DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS"

MARTIN

(looking ahead)

He sells BMW's?

PAUL

He sold me this bad boy.

MARTIN

How could you put your hard-earned

dollars into the hands of the class

bully?

PAUL

He gave me a great deal.

MARTIN

Mein Dealer.

PAUL

Hey! Bob! The car's running great.

BOB

(dismissive)

Glad to hear it.

MARTIN

(shouts)

Bob...

BOB

(turning)

What?

MARTIN

It's me. Martin Blank.

BOB

Really...? So what?

MARTIN

Okay. See you later.

PAUL

See you at the left-a-boy-came-back-

a-man-made-good party.

CARL

Can I help you?

MARTIN

What's done is done.

SKATEBOARDER

What the fuck, man?!

MARTIN

Are you going to the reunion?

DEBI

No. I'm not going. Is that why you're

here?

MARTIN

That's part of it.

DEBI

Well, you'll have a ball. You seem

to have everything everybody wants

when they go back. The car, the suit,

the watch. The look. That just leaves

the little things, like happiness,

character, point of view...

MARTIN

It's always the little things.

DEBI

Yep.

MARTIN

I'm wondering how you've been. How

you are. I'd like to catch up with

you. If it's possible.

DEBI

Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.

MARTIN

Well, there's not much to tell.

DEBI

I'm sure you've done worthwhile things

in the last ten years. You've had

experiences.

MARTIN

Bad experiences.

DEBI

You met people.

MARTIN

Bad people.

DEBI

Watched television?

MARTIN

Bad television.

DEBI

(amused)

Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It

sounds like you need a Shockabuku.

MARTIN

What's that?

DEBI

It's a swift spiritual kick to the

head that alters your reality forever.

MARTIN

That'd be good.

DEBI

What do you want?

MARTIN

I figured I could pick you up tomorrow

around seven o'clock.

DEBI

Let me get this straight, are you

asking me out?

MARTIN

Yes.

DEBI

Unbelievable.

MARTIN

Seven it is.

DEBI

I'll think about it.

MONTY

Baby, it's eight o'clock.

MARCELLA

Thanks, Monty.

MARCELLA

Hey there, how'd it go?

MARTIN

It isn't done.

MARCELLA

This is not good.

MARTIN

I'll do it tomorrow.

MARCELLA

What's it look like?

MARTIN

It's fine.

MARCELLA

You haven't looked at the dossier.

MARTIN

(a little defensive)

I've looked at it.

MARCELLA

You have.

MARTIN

Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing

remarkable about it at all.

MARCELLA

I have to call the client and give

them a reason why you're late.

MARTIN

Tell them my house exploded.

MARCELLA

I'll call them and tell them you're

taking your time. Being a

professional.

MARTIN

Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if

you could find out why they double-

booked the job, and who is trying to

kill me, and call me back-- that's

be great.

MARCELLA

Will do.

DEBI

(filtered)

Are you there?

MARTIN

Yes.

DEBI

Pick me up at my father's house at

around seven. And don't be late this

time.

DEBI

Hello...?

MARTIN

This night, this reunion will be an

important step in our relationship.

DEBI

You're fucking psycho.

MARTIN

Don't rush to judgement until all

the facts are in.

MCCULLERS

I wish he'd do his job already so we

could do our job.

LARDNER

We can't do our job unless he does

his job.

MCCULLERS

Why don't we just do his job then,

so we can do our job, and get the

fuck out of here.

LARDNER

Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded

killer.

MCCULLERS

Wait a minute--

LARDNER

-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy,

but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until

a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and

then you come in and kill the Bad

Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

MCCULLERS

So if we do his job, we're the bad

guys. If we do our job, we're the

good guys.

LARDNER

Yup.

GROCER

moving into the diner.

GROCER

Easy, tiger.

WAITRESS

Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My

name is Melanie and I'll be your

server this morning. Let me tell you

about some of our specials. Today we

have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our

feature omelette. And there's our

"Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if

you're in the mood for something

different there's the "I left my

heart in San Franchezie."

GROCER

I want two eggs poached, hash brown

well-done. English muffin for the

bread. And a coffee.

MARTIN

Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg-

white omelette.

WAITRESS

What would you like in the omelette?

MARTIN

Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at

all.

GROCER

(re: the omelette)

Come on, live a little. I'm sorry

about the incident yesterday.

MARTIN

No harm no foul.

GROCER

A little misunderstanding among my

associates.

GROCER

I told them to kill you and they

didn't.

MARTIN

Hard to get good help these days.

GROCER

But since we're both here, I think

it's time to take a fresh look at

our relationship.

MARTIN

I didn't get into this business to

have "associates." And I don't want

to join your Goddamned union. "Loner--

" "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my

own." That's the whole point. Why

don't you become a cop, or something.

You can drink coffee in the morning...

with friends!

MARTIN

(easing up)

Look, this is a one-on-one business...

Every time you get to know people,

bad things happen. If it'll make you

feel any better, this is my last

job. So what do you say we put our

guns away and forget the whole damn

thing.

GROCER

Fuck you! No scabs! From now on,

everything's regulated!

MARTIN

No deal.

GROCER

Fine. But we're not going to let you

do your job. Because we're gonna do

it. And then, after we do your job,

we're gonna do another little job...

MARTIN

(Wry)

Is that right?

GROCER

Yeah-- after I shoot you through the

fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you

in the bullethole.

MARTIN

Nice talk, Sugarmouth.

MARTIN

(trying on smile)

Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell

couch insurance. I test-market

positive thinking. I lead a weekend

men's group, actually. We specialize

in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are

you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh.

(sarcastic)

Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me?

I'm not married, I have no kids and

I'd blow your brains out if someone

paid me enough... So how've you been?

Where do you stand on The Issues?

Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud,

shamed, blahblahblahblah--

DEBI

Flowers. That's funny.

MARTIN

As long as I get the laugh.

DEBI

(taking them)

Here. Let me put these in some rubbing

alcohol.

MARTIN

You look beautiful.

DEBI

Okay... Hold on...

DEBI (V.O.)

...Let me get my coat.

MARTIN

I'll just help myself to a cocktail.

MARTIN

Good evening, Mr. Newberry.

MR. NEWBERRY

Good evening, Mr. Blank.

MARTIN

How are you? How's business?

MR. NEWBERRY

Martin, I don't know where you've

been since you abandoned my daughter

ten years ago, and I don't care. It

was good that you left, and I'm glad

you did. So what do you want to talk

about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe

I had you figured wrong.

MARTIN

How's that?

MR. NEWBERRY

I visualized you, in a haze, as one

of the slackster, flannel-wearing,

coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been

seeing in Newsweek.

MARTIN

I took the other road. I'm more of a

self-reflective young lion who does

business with lead-pipe cruelty and

goes home to drink light beer in

milky-eyes isolation. I love sports

and sex and have no real relationships

with anyone. And you?

MR. NEWBERRY

Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the

same old sell-out baby-boomer,

exploiting the oppressed I got shot

for at Kent State. But why don't we

have a drink and forget the whole

thing?

MARTIN

Why not?

MR. NEWBERRY

So what are you doing with your life

now, son?

MARTIN

I'm a professional killer.

MR. NEWBERRY

That's good.

DEBI (O.S.)

Okay

MARTIN

Do you want to get a drink first?

DEBI

I think they'll probably have booze

there.

MARTIN

Right.

MARTIN

I'll just be a second.

DEBI

Okay...

MARTIN

(defensive)

...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but

someone tried to kill me and the guy

in the middle got killed. So if I

see that guy again I'm definitely

going to kill him, but I won't kill

anyone else. Oh, except for the guy

I was sent here to kill. I don't

know...

DR. OATMAN

What else? Say more.

MARTIN

Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm

on my way to the reunion.

DR. OATMAN

Okay. Repeat this after me.

MARTIN

Out Loud?

MARTIN

...I am at home with the me. I am

rooted in me, who is on this

adventure.

DR. OATMAN

Take a deep breath and realize, that

this is me breathing.

MARTIN

This is me breating.

MARITN

Alright, look. I gotta go.

DR. OATMAN

And don't kill anyone.

MARTIN

Right. Don't kill anyone...

LARDNER

He's falling for her. Look at him.

MCCULLERS

He using her.

LARDNER

You're wrong. Look at his face.

MCCULLERS

One cannot love and kill.

LARDNER

(defensive)

I love. I kill.

MARTIN

(to himself)

Shoulda brought my gun.

DEBI

What?

ARLENE

Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott-

Joseph.

MARTIN

I'm Martin Blank.

DEBI

Debi Newberry.

ARLENE

Marty, you haven't changed a bit!

MARTIN

Don't say that.

ARLENE

We had pictures put on, that way

everybody knows who everybody was!

MARTIN

Wonderful.

ARLENE

So, what are you doing now?

MARTIN

Whatever I can get away with.

ARLENE

(to the next person)

Isn't it cute. It's so everybody

knows who everybody was!

BATENDER

What can I make you?

MARTIN

Beer.

MARTIN

Hey, Ken. How have you been?

KEN

(glancing at Martin's

name tag)

Hello Martin. How have you been?

MARTIN

Not bad. You?

KEN

Hello, Bob.

MARTIN

Hey, Bob.

KEN

I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice

& Fromeyer.

MARTIN

That sounds pretty interesting...

KEN

Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly.

Some property. Some personal injury.

MARTIN

Those all seem kind of related...

MARTIN

Tragedy makes you thirsty.

MARTIN

Well... I have to take this over to

Debi.

KEN

Here. Take my card. Wait a minute...

here's a special one. For top-shelf

clients.

MARTIN

Thanks.

TERRY

I don't know, Blank, all these fucking

people, driving me crazy. Look at

them over there, memorializing old

times, acting all like it was

something "life-changing." And the

people in the National Honor Society?

The name tags?

TERRY

They have special blue starts on

them like it fucking matters now

that they were in the honor club ten

years ago. I'm getting fucking

nauseous from all this sentimental

bullshit. It's making me sick.

MARTIN

Why are you here... Terry?

TERRY

I wanted to see a couple people. But

I don't want to talk about the old

days... What did we have together,

Martin? Typing?

MARTIN

(remembering)

Drafting.

TERRY

Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking

class. But I appreciate you helping

me out, man.

MARTIN

Don't mention it.

TERRY

Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try

and get out of here, man. I'll see

you later.

DAN

Bob. Bob Destephano.

BOB

What?

DAN

I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

BOB

Computer guy.

DAN

Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's

dealership the other day.

BOB

I sell BMW's. What do you do?

DAN

Not much, actually. My software

company just went public so I'm

just... hanging out, really.

BOB

Remember high school?

DAN

Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us

up in the grandstands?

MIKE

...You gotta hold the fans

responsible, though, Dennis, because

they're the ones putting up with the

mediocre product.

DENNIS

I guess, though, you know, if you

look at it Mike, that park is a

beautiful park, I've gone to that

park many times - I've had the

greatest time of my life at that

ballpark and let's face it, I tell

you this, Mike, by the sixth inning,

if you're having the fun you should

be having at Tigers Stadium, you

don't even know what the hell's going

on anyway...

DARIUS

Have you two been together since

high school?

DEBI

No--

MARTIN

--Yes. Actually we just bought that

little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine

Avenue... Debi's a social worker and

I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--

DEBI

We haven't seen each other since

high school.

DARIUS

I figured. You two look too happy

together. I shouldn't say that though,

I'm married... So, Martin-- what are

you up to these days? What do you do

for a living?

MARTIN

I'm in pro-active international

relations. It's a very specialized

company. We execute economic

investment opportunities. Sort of

economic clean-up... with an emphasis

on personnel. It's boring, you know,

it's boring. I don't like to talk

about it because I don't think what

a man does necessarily reflects who

he is...

MARTIN

...I've always tried to refrain from

a black-and-white moral lexicon--you

know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've

been more interested in the gray

areas.

MARTIN

But that's no way to live. I guess

you've got to just take the leap of

faith. Believe in something. Fuck

it.

DARIUS

Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you

happy?

MARTIN

I just have to close this one last

account. I'd like to just stop now,

today, but I can't... It's a step in

the right direction.

DEBI

I don't know, Martin. It sounds like

you're feeling compromised. Live the

way you want. The only thing that's

inexcusable, to me, is cynicism.

That's the biggest cop-out there is.

AMY

But wait. I still don't understand

what you do.

MARTIN

I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

AMY

You do not.

MARTIN

Yes I do.

AMY

You don't...

MARTIN

In the corporate offices.

AMY

Oh... really?

MARTIN

Yeah...

AMY

What do you do?

MARTIN

I sell biscuits to the Southland.

AMY

You do not.

MARTIN

It's what I do.

AMY

You're so funny...

MARTIN

I sell biscuits and gravy all over

the Southland--

AMY

--Stop it--

MARTIN

You know those horsey biscuit gravy

packets? I move all of those--

AMY

--No.

MARTIN

Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's

and just change them to special

barbecue sauce.

DENNIS

What do you think about black coaching

in the NFL, Darius? Because I think

it's great.

DARIUS

I don't pay much attention to

football.

MIKE

I have to agree with you Dennis.

It's good to see that the owners are

willing to put the franchise behind

a black head coach or QB when for

years in the league they've been

kept out of the thinking positions

and relegated mainly to the physical

game.

DENNIS

But now, you see, you have Warren

Moon at the helm, Cunningham, Art

Shell, and the coach up at

Minnesota...

MIKE

Dennis Green. And if you remember,

Doug Williams was the first black

man to prove that on a Superbowl

Sunday.

AMY

(to Martin)

I'm teaching art at Cedar Junior

High School.

DENNIS

...Yeah, listen. Where do you stand

on this whole Louis Farrakhan

issue...?

DARIUS

(facetious)

I'm a De Klerk man myself.

DEBI

I'm going over to play some tunes.

DAN

Look at her. There it is. Jenny

Slater. The finest thing that ever

walked these halls.

FORMER-SQUARE #2

I believe she married the state of

Maine.

DAN

Yeah, he's around here somewhere.

What a shame. She would have looked

great in my fucking Bentley.

FORMER-SQUARE #3

No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only

was she as fine, if not finer, than

Slater, but she had the "bad girl"

thing going for her. And the red

hair. C'mon.

DAN

She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois.

FORMER-SQUARE #2

You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti

was the finest. No question about

it.

FORMER-SQUARE #3

The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's.

All named Jenny...

DAN

You know what I'm really hoping?

That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And

she's twenty-eight--

FORMER-SQUARE #3

--she's got half the state of Maine--

DAN

She's twenty-eight years old, with

two kids, she's still really really

fine, and I see her at a bookstore

or something, and she sees me for

what I was then, and what I am now:

the redemption for all her failure.

FORMER-SQUARE #3

You mean the redemption for all your

failure.

CUT TO:

DEBI

Which would you rather...?

MARTIN

Okay... Would you rather... commit

yourself sexually to a four-by-nine

cell with former President George

Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a

super-model for a month, or make

love to a otter on crank for a week?

DEBI

Soft. I'll take the junkie otter,

clearly! I'd let the little beast

scratch and claw all he wants...

Okay. Would you rather make love to

the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

MARTIN

--She's not dead---

DEBI

It's just a game...! Alright. Candied

Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest

across the desert with a fully

digested crab apple in your mouth?

MARTIN

Wow. I have to give this some thought.

DEBI

No time.

MARTIN

Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.

STACEY

Marty! Debi! How are you! So many

people came, but I never expected to

see you Marty. Or you Debi... I

mean... because of what your

divorce... I didn't mean to say that.

I just meant you look so good.

DEBI

Thank you.

STACEY

Do you think you could play "Too

Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo?

DEBI

Stacey, why don't you come up here

and take over for a little while?

STACEY

I'd love to.

DEBI

(to Martin)

Everybody thinks they know me now

that I'm divorced.

DEBI

It's time to see you in private.

MARTIN

Even though I left, you never left

me. Not just memory but a substance

in my blood.

DEBI

(smiling)

Like heroin?

MARTIN

Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

DEBI

(enjoying this)

Like love?

MARTIN

Could be. The physical substance of

love.

DEBI

I'll accept that. Follow me.

MCCULLERS

Looks like someone keeps trying to

do our job for us.

LARDNER

If he does our job, he's our job.

MCCULLERS

I get it.

DEBI

I'll be right back....

BOB

So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that

shit again?

MARTIN

Fine, Bob. How are you?

BOB

Never better.

MARTIN

Really?

BOB

Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing

adds up to nothing... you work your

whole life, day in and day out-- try

to make sense of it all. One day

you're twenty-seven and what do you

get to show for it...

MARTIN

You could've been a contender, huh?

BOB

Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how

smart you are with my foot up your

ass! I'm gonna kick your ass!

MARTIN

Why would you want to hit me, Bob?

Do you really believe that there's

some stored up conflict that needs

resolution between us? We don't exist.

There's nothing between us. So who

do you want to hit, Bob? It's not

me.

BOB

What am I gonna do?

MARTIN

What do you want to do?

BOB

I want to be an actor.

MARTIN

Then express yourself, Bob.

MARTIN

(catching him)

Be honest...

BOB

Later, Martin.

"SPANISH CLUB FIESTA FUN-RAISER SATURDAY JUNE 1"

MARTIN

Have you seen Debi Newberry?

KEN

Nope.

KEN

The more things change, the more

they Goddamned well stay the same.

MARTIN

I guess.

MARTIN

Take care of yourself, Ken. Thanks

for the pen.

PAUL

What the hell happened to you?

MARTIN

I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

PAUL

As long as you had a good time.

PAUL

What now? Chase the girl?

MARTIN

It didn't work out.

PAUL

That's too bad.

MARTIN

I have to get my head back into my

work.

PAUL

Work's good for the soul.

MARTIN

When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.

PAUL

See you in ten years.

MARTIN

Dumb fucking luck...

DEBI

He was trying to kill you, right!

MARTIN

Yes.

DEBI

Not the other way around...?

MARTIN

No.

DEBI

Is it something you've done?

MARTIN

It's something I do...

MARTIN

...Professionally...

MARTIN

...About five years now.

DEBI

(stunned)

Get the fuck outta here.

MARTIN

Seriously, when I left, I joined the

Army and took the service exam. They

found my psych results fit a certain

profile. A certain "Moral flexibility"

would be the best way to describe

it... I was loaned out to a CIA-

sponsored program. It's called

"mechanical operations." We sort of

found each other...

DEBI

You're a government spook?

MARTIN

I was, but no... yes... I was before,

but now I'm not. It's irrelevant,

really. The idea of governments,

nations, it's mostly a public

relations theory at this point,

anyway. But I'll tell you something,

until about five months ago, I really

enjoyed my work.

DEBI

Jesus Christ!

MARTIN

Then I started losing my taste for

it. Which usually means your time is

up. But then I realized it was

something entirely different... I

started getting the sneaking, dark

suspicion that maybe there was...

meaning to life.

DEBI

Okay. Great, Martin, that's just

great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

MARTIN

Like, that there's a point? An organic

connection between all living things.

DEBI

Let me help you along, Martin. You're

a sociopath!

MARTIN

(defensive)

A sociopath kills for no reason. I

kill for money.

DEBI

You never could have kept this from

me.

MARTIN

I was leaving.

DEBI

That's probably a good idea.

MARTIN

Will you come with me?

DEBI

I'm staying here.

MARTIN

What if I come back?

DEBI

I'll hide.

MARTIN

Don't go.

DEBI

You don't get to have me. You are a

monster, I'm a human being. We're

not going to mate.

MARTIN

You don't understand...

DEBI

That's because I speak human, and

you speak monster.

MARTIN

"What's up Doc? What's cookin'? What's

up Doc, are you lookin'...?

MARCELLA

I'm bringing down the office now.

MARTIN

I'll put things right. Then I'll

find you.

MARCELLA

(apprehensive)

Uh... why?

MARTIN

Don't worry. I left you a little

something under your desk.

MARCELLA

All right!!

GROCER

Oh shit...

NEWBERRY

What the fuck is the matter with

you?!

MARTIN

Well, I was hired to kill you. It's

what I do, and come to think of it,

I told you that, but... Okay. I'm

not going to do it. Get in the car.

MARTIN

It's either because I'm in love with

your daughter, or because I have a

new-found respect for life. Or both.

But I don't know.

GROCER

That punk is either in love with

that guy's daughter or he has new

found respect for life... Let's go.

NEWBERRY

Why? I build cars! They're paying

you to kill me? Why?

MARTIN

It was a cost-cutting effort. They

can't afford a recall.

NEWBERRY

It was a leaky sunroof! A design

flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof!

You want to kill me because of that?

MARTIN

It's not me! Why does everybody think

it's personal?!

LARDNER

We'll go in through the woods.

MARTIN

I was sitting in my house on prom

night wearing that Goddamned rented

tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a

bottle of champagne in the other. So

I was just sitting there, and then

the whole night flashed before my

eyes, and it struck me like a bullet

in the head-- I realized, finally,

and for the first time, that... I

wanted to kill somebody. So I figured

because I loved you so much, that'd

it'd be a good idea if I didn't see

you anymore. But now I'm different.

MARTIN

I'm in love with you. I know we can

make this work!

MARTIN

I was afraid to commit to a

relationship, but now I know I'm

ready to make it happen.

MARTIN

I just need time to change.

MARTIN

It's not easy for me. I was raised

to close off, to control my

feelings...

MARTIN

Lock the door.

MARTIN

I wasn't raised in a loving

environment.

(beat)

But that's not an excuse. It's a

reason.

MARTIN

My soul was empty--

MARTIN

--and it's up to me to fill it.

MARTIN

(through the door)

It's okay. It's Martin The door begins

to open revealing Debi and Newberry.

MARTIN

I know what I do isn't moral, per

se, but if you could just look past

that, you'd see a man worth loving.

GROCER (O.S.)

Don't listen to him, he's a

professional.

GROCER (O.S.)

You're breaking my heart down here,

Blank. I can't shoot through the

tears.

LARDNER

Did you see Blank in there?

MCCULLERS

No...

LARDNER

Good. For a second there I thought

we were in trouble.

GROCER

...How about I sell you two rounds

for a hundred grand a piece?

MARTIN

Okay.

MARTIN

There you go. I left it blank.

GROCER

Excellent. Here they come.

MARTIN (V.O.)

Debi... will you marry me?

DEBI

This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry

cause that's what it does. Bringing

you New Ones for the Nineties, a

fresh new format designed to pull

you out of what's come before, and

reel you into what's coming soon--

DEBI

I tell you what's coming soon for

me, or at least what I dreamed this

morning in that weird time just before

you actually wake up. But first this

commercial. Back after this...

ANNOUNCER

Don't miss the show of the season at

Bilkin Community Center! "Brigadoon!"

A musical for all ages! "Brigadoon,"

starring Carol Plummer, Thomas

Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee

Ordman!...

DEBI

RFN...

DEBI

Hey out there... Okay... I'm going

to finish up that fantasy later.

First I'll give you an hour of nonstop

music... If I don't come back on

after that-- well, nevermind.

DEBI

This will never work out.

DEBI

You kill people.

(beat)

MARTIN

I have no illusions about the future.

What is, is. We make choices. And we

become the sum total of our choices.

I can live with that.

DEBI

Other people can't.
