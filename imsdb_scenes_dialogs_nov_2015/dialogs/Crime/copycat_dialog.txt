HELEN

Our society creates these socially

and psychically disenfranchised

men, and their revenge on society

is terrible.  They are hard to

catch.  They are "the nice guy next

door," their employers -- if they

work at all -- find them quiet and

uncomplaining.  Early abuse and

rejection have taught them

passivity.  Only in their violent

fantasies do they feel alive.  What

they seek in their frenzied

assaults on their victims is relief

from passivity.  For these men, ten

minutes relief is worth far more

than the life of another human

being.  Torture, the pain they

inflict, the screams of the victim,

are all part of the ritual that

gives them a brief respite from

their own psychic pain.  And then

the depression, the forgetting, the

feeling of sadness and despair

begins the cycle all over again.

Like addicts seeking their drug,

Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,

Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they

seek out their next victim.

HELEN

The cycle is endless until they are

caught.  And they are caught by

chance -- they run a red light, and

a body is in the trunk.  A leaking

pipe brings a plumber to a basement

where they is the smell of death.

HELEN

At any time, right now, as you

listen, the FBI estimates there are

30 to 35 serial killers stalking

their victims.  The serial killer is

a plaque that must be addressed not

only by the law, but by science.

Florida spent eight million dollars

to execute Ted Bundy.  It would

have been better spent building a

forensic penal facility devoted to

research.

HELEN

Confined for life, without parole,

and subjected to scientific study,

these men's lives might finally, in

some small measure, educate and

thereby protect society.  Thank

you.

HELEN

It is October twelfth, 1994 in the

city of San Francisco, California,

U.S.A., the strongest, richest,

most stable and happiest country in

the world.  That is the sole place

of life in the universe.  Under

God.

HELEN

Good God.  What happened to you?

CUT TO:

CHESSMASTER

'It's almost seven.  Make a goddam

move.'

CHESSMASTER

'Lousy move.  Not really into this

game, Helen.  Let's drop it.  I've

got a feeling about you.  Let's

meet.  Like a date.'

HELEN

'I'm a terrible date.  I'd mess up your

life.'

CHESSMASTER

'Another romantic dream gone all to

hell.'

HELEN

'Maybe it's better to just dream

on; avoid the disappointments of

life.  Come on, move.'

COMPUTER

(filter)

You Queen is in check.

Protect your Queen.

M.J. (V.O.)

My third grade teacher at the

convent shot better than that.

RUBEN

Yeah, but she had divine guidance.

M.J.

I'd feel a whole

lot

Sister Loretta for my backup.  Look

at this guy: you shredded him!

RUBEN

Well, he's dead, he can't hurt me

now.

M.J.

It's sloppy shooting.  It's in

character, Ruben, but unnecessary.

And bad for your career.

RUBEN

I've been practicing.  Now can I

kiss your tummy?

M.J.

Perp's holding a hostage, the

shoulder on his gun hand is gonna

be exposed.

M.J.

Answer it.

RUBEN

I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't

you at least interested in which

one it is?

RUBEN

(into phone)

I'm here, where are you?...

Heeeeyyy

!  What a surprise!  No.  On

duty, have to call you back... You,

too, you too.  My God, you made my

day.

M.J.

You hit the brachial nerve...

M.J.

You're good enough you'll never

have to kill anyone.  I joined the

cops to save lives, not waste them.

RUBEN

You know, M.J., when I watch you

shoot, I realize I've got a little

problem with my stance... could you

just move over here and critique my

legs?

M.J.

The problem is between your legs.

You told your shrink about that?

RUBEN

I tell my shrink about

you

,

Sergeant.  I tell him you're the

top cop of my dreams.

M.J.

(putting away her

gear)

Don't take that mess in the car.

RUBEN

He's in love with you already...

CUT TO:

M.J.

Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already

here.

RUBEN

Hey.  And there's the Haircut right

behind.  If she stops short he's

gonna be there feet up her ass...

SUSAN

(on camera)

Inspector, can you...

M.J.

I just got here myself, Susan.

SUSAN

...confirm this third murder adds

up to a pattern?  Do we have a

serial killer on the loose in the

city?

M.J.

I just got here.  Talk to you

later...

M.J.

(as they escape behind the

barrier tape)

What the hell does she want to do,

scare everybody to death?

RUBEN

That's her job... Jesus, Quinn is

here already.

QUINN

I been waiting... I have to do

everything myself.  Photo, crime

tech, the Coroner are already

inside.  The Landlady calls it in;

tenant is not answering when

called, she sticks her head in,

sees the body, uses the deceased's

telephone to call 911.  Otherwise

nothing disturbed.  It's all yours,

kid.  I'll take care of the Mouth

and the Haircut.

M.J.

(to cop)

That the Landlady?

(to Ruben)

You wanna talk to her, Ruben?

(back to cops)

Who was first on the scene?

MIKE

I was.

M.J.

(forcefully)

I'm over here?  What's your name,

Officer?

MIKE

Michael Johnson.

M.J.

You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up

anything?  Use the doorknob?  I

don't want to find your prints on

anything later and you tell me you

forgot to tell me.

MIKE

No.  I didn't.

DOC (V.O.)

Liver and rigor are telling me

about eight hours.  I'm gonna take

her out now if it's alright.

M.J.

I'm seeing ligature marks on her

neck here, petechial hemorrhages in

her eyes.  Strangled.

DOC

You got it.  Same as the other two.

COP (V.O.)

Tell whoever she can't come to the

phone, she's all tied up.

M.J.

That's real old material, get a new

writer...

M.J.

Hello?

PHONE VOICE

(extremely cheerful)

Hello!  This is Geena Martinez, how

are you this morning?

M.J.

What is this about, Ms Martinez?

PHONE VOICE

I'm conducting a telephone survey

to determine whether you're

satisfied with your insurance on

your personal valuables...

DOC

He used something soft, like a

stocking or a bathrobe tie.

M.J.

Anybody find it?

M.J.

Cover her up, please.

M.J.

Mike.  Why don't you tell me what's

bothering you?

M.J.

Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out

and sooner is a hell of lot better

than later.

MIKE

Well, there's something missing in

there.  There was something around

her neck when I came in there, but

it's gone now.

M.J.

Who came in after you?

MIKE

Lieutenant  Quinn.

M.J.

Well, it's all right, then, Mike.

Thanks.

M.J.

(to Photographer)

Get me good faces on the crowd

here.  Get a couple of harness bulls

to grab anybody who starts to

run...

PHOTOGRAPHER

Don't tell your Grandmother how to

suck eggs.  I only been doing this

work since your junior prom,

darling...

CUT TO:

HELEN (V.O.)

Damn fools!

CUT TO:

SUSAN

... continues to stonewall the

public.  Now...

M.J.

You messed with the scene.

QUINN

Shut up.

SUSAN

... third Bay Area woman has been

strangled, but the police continue

to deny that this is the work of

one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn

declares that the murders will be

treated as unrelated crimes, unless

new evidence...

M.J.

You messed with the evidence.

QUINN

I tagged the goddamned stocking.

It ain't lost.  We're sequestering

that evidence.  That's the trap some

son of a bitch is going to fall

into...

M.J.

Am I in charge of this thing?  Or

not.

QUINN

I said you were...

NH

Then I decided what evidence we

choose to sequester.

QUINN

(a beat here)

Okay.  What do you want to

sequester?

M.J.

The stocking around the neck.

QUINN

You didn't say serial killer and I

didn't say serial killer.

M.J.

Right.

QUINN

(not satisfied she

really means it)

This is the anniversary of the

summer of love and your city

fathers have declared a Festival of

Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of

Commerce don't want TV announcing

killers on the loose.

M.J.

Right.

QUINN

We're gonna have a bunch of clapped

out old hippies blissing on the

Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the

park, smoking dope and sticking

tulips up their ass.

M.J.

(exiting)

Good.

CUT TO:

NIKKO

Harvey, I don't want you in here no

more, making false statements...

CONFESSOR

They are not false.  We pay for

city government like this, you

don't even care about the truth?!

I killed her in the bathtub.

NIKKO

Why?

CONFESSOR

Because she was dirty, a dirty

girl!

NIKKO

How?  How did you do it, Harvey?

HARVEY

With a knife?

NIKKO

Good guess, but not good enough.

Get the fuck outta here...

NIKKO

What am I wasting my time with this

shit for?

M.J.

Because it's your job, that's all.

NIKKO

Not what I meant; why

me

?

M.J.

(cutting)

Maybe it's something you did in

this life, Nikko...

NIKKO

Got me.  That really hurt!  You...

M.J.

(to Ruben)

Get Mercer to run the medical,

dental, legal bills, laundry and

dry cleaning receipts, extermin-

ators, mailmen, grocery and

drugstore deliveries, handymen,

plumbers...

RUBEN

It's mostly done, they got nobody

in common, the three of them... No

mutual friends -- the Landlady says

nobody was ever there, she never

saw her with anybody.

PACHULSKI

(into phone)

Yes, ma'am, I know.  You can't talk

her right now... because she's

busy, she's all tied up.

(sotto to M.J.)

Deep Throat's back.

FEMALE PHONE VOICE

This is the third one.  You've got

a serial killer here.  When are you

going to start

warning

PACHULSKI

(whispering)

Fourteen calls from this broad.

And she ain't stupid.

M.J.

Who is this?

HELEN

Who is this?

M.J.

Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm

in charge here.

PACHULSKI

(amused)

Ask her about the moon bike.

M.J.

I'm really interested in your

ideas.  The moon bike.  What

is

that?

HELEN

What is wrong with you people?

The first two, I thought he might

be on a lunar cycle because they

were 28 days apart, but obviously

not.  This new one is only two

weeks.

HELEN (cont'd)

You want to joke about moonbikes?!

M.J.

No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And

neither is tying up telephone lines

to police with crank calls while

people in trouble are trying to get

through for help.

HELEN

You're calling me a crank?

M.J.

Do you have any evidence to report,

ma'am?  Do you know any of the

victims...

HELEN

I think this is number three...

M.J.

(over her)

That's an opinion, not evidence...

M.J.

(covers the phone)

Helen Hudson.  Get Ruben back

here?

CUT TO:

HELEN

Where were you?  Don't tell me.

It's just under seventy, right?  The

sun is strong but the air is dry

and fresh...

ANDY

Would you please get your hands off

my face, Tallulah?  What happened

to the newspaper?

HELEN

I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

ANDY

Well!  Aren't we the daring one?

What's morbid and ghastly enough in

the news to make Doctor Helen set

foot outside her door?  The antenna

is gone off her car again.  I had

no music, all the way to the

market.  Let me find a garage for

it?

HELEN

I've told you:  I can't afford to

garage it.

ANDY

Are you kidding?  You buy enough

gourmet junk every week... most of

which

rots

... to garage a fleet of

stretch limos.

HELEN

I had the dream again.

(beat)

And I got another call.  This time

he spoke.  He said "You and me, you

and me."

ANDY

A little heavy breathing is what

most of us yearn for.

Forget

HELEN

He whispered, but it was

him

!  I

know it was him!

ANDY

He can't phone you unless the

warden gets an okay from you.  Did

you give him an approval?

HELEN

Andy?  When a three-year-old says

there's a monster under the bed,

you don't say 'forget it'.  You

look under the bad.

(beat)

I'm three years old.  Call the

prison.

HELEN

Oh God.  I'm really crazy.

ANDY

When was the last time you washed

your hair?

HELEN

(shaky, but trying)

Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my

coiffure?

ANDY

Monsieur Andy can

smell

coiffure.  And guess what else?

ANDY

Cellulite.  What do you say I

blindfold you and take you to the

gym.  Aerobics with housewives...

HELEN

Andy?

ANDY

Here we go again.

HELEN

You parked right behind him.  The

one I noticed earlier.  I didn't

say anything, I thought he'd leave.

Just take a look.

ANDY

Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A

NEWSPAPER!

HELEN

But earlier, he was staring up

here.

Please

, Andy.

ANDY

Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry'

coming up.

ANDY

Excuse me, but would you mind

explaining why you're watching the

lady upstairs?

RUBEN

None of your fucking business.

ANDY

Listen, asshole, I've got a gun...

RUBEN

I hate this...

ANDY

Only kidding!

HELEN

I'm calling the police!

CUT TO:

M.J.

Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I

apologize for Goetz, he's a

firehouse dog.

ANDY

(trying to defuse)

I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed

it.

M.J.

(trying to communicate

here)

Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor

impulse control.

HELEN

Is he out?

M.J.

Who?

HELEN

(to Andy)

If he's not out, why are they here?

M.J.

Because of your phone calls.

HELEN

What calls?  I haven't made any

calls.

ANDY

(to distract)

Are you staying long?  Shall I shut

the door?  Make your coffee?  Make

the beds?

M.J.

(to Helen)

You talked to me.  Do you remember?

HELEN

You were the one that talked about

moonbikes and called me a crank?

Oh God, I

am

!

(to Andy)

Make them some coffee.

(to M.J.)

Halloran, is it?  Investigator

Goetz?  I had a crank call myself--

he said...

(a moment of real

fear)

I thought it might be Daryll Lee

Cullum.  I thought he might be out

of prison.

RUBEN

Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think

so.  If he's escaped we'd have the

National Guard, cops'd be crawling

through sewers.  You'd have a guard

on your front door.

M.J.

(looking around)

I want to tell you it's a great

honor to meet you and talk to you.

HELEN

You don't admire me.  No police

admire me.  I got one of you

killed.  Why don't you say right

out what you're here for?

M.J.

You

us

, Doctor Hudson.

HELEN

Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control.

The accounts of the firs two

murders made it so clear they were

the work of the same man, but you

kept announcing they were

unrelated.  You'll never catch him

that way.

M.J.

(to Andy)

Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take

mine black.

(beat)

You're absolutely correct.  The

politicians don't want panic

headlines spoiling the Festival of

Love.

HELEN

Well, let's thank God you and

Inspector Goetz are on the case,

then.

M.J.

Would you want to work with us on

this?

HELEN

Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical

hysteric, with panic syndrome, and

anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm

afraid of everything, real and

imaginary.  I never leave this

apartment now.  Nobody ever comes

here.  I just wanted to get your

attention.  I write and I used to

lecture on these crimes, but... I'm

not competent.

M.J.

I think you are.  I really admire

everything you've done; it would be

an honor to work with you, and we

need all the help we can get,

especially yours.

HELEN

Inspector Halloran, that is so much

bullshit, you don't like or admire

me, but the beautiful part is I

don't give a fuck.  That's the

upside of having a breakdown.

M.J.

Well, it's a hell of an apartment

you got here.  I'm living one step

away from the projects, myself, but

I get to go to work every day,

wading in blood and guts.  I guess

the books you wrote about these

sons of bitches paid off pretty

good.

HELEN

Will you go.  Andy, make them go.

M.J.

You can't go out lecturing?  Tough

shit.  Women are dying.  Where can

I lay this stuff out?

HELEN

I don't want this.  What are they?

RUBEN

You called us, Doctor, if you don't

want to look at them here, how

about downtown.  I'll drive you

down...

ANDY

(to Ruben)

Now look what you did.

RUBEN

What did I do?

ANDY

You threatened to drive her

downtown.  She has agoraphobia.

RUBEN

Fear of what...

ANDY

Open space.  She hasn't been out of

this apartment in three years.  I

didn't used to think it was real...

M.J.

We'll get the paramedics...

ANDY

Oh, God, uniforms, more stress.

Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting:

she hyperventilates till she passes

out, then her breathing goes back

to normal, and she wakes up singing

like a lark.

(rocking the

unconscious Helen)

We know, don't we, Princess?

(to them)

Give her a couple of hours.  I know

about this.

M.J.

Tell her we're sorry we bothered

her.

ANDY

Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you

really want her help.  I mean if

you really do, leave them.  Let her

see them.  I'll see they're safe...

M.J.

Tell her to ask for me...

CUT TO:

M.J.

Snotty neurotic bitch...

RUBEN

(amused)

Classy madonna.

M.J.

Sure.  She likes

you

, Rube.  She

likes the way you move.  She sure

as hell isn't in love with me.

RUBEN

You came in there with this

attitude...

M.J.

(over him)

Order Chinese for us and meet me

the library?  Anything but beef.

ANDY

Shit...

CUT TO:

ATTORNEY

... it was your feeling after

careful evaluation that he was a

sexual sadist who satisfied at

least four out of ten criteria in

the DMS III?

HELEN

Yes.  Without question.

ATTORNEY

Without question?  He only scored

40 percent, four out of ten

criteria?  Couldn't another expert

say he

flunked

test?  What curve are you marking

on, Doctor?

HELEN

The test criteria are only part of

what we look at in evaluating

subjects.

ATTORNEY

Only part.  What else?  What did

you think of his claim that he tied

this girl to the tree and set fire

to her because Joan of Arc told him

to do it.

HELEN

He was lying.

ATTORNEY

'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked

you what you thought, not what he

did.

HELEN

I thought he was lying.

ATTORNEY

You said, first, he was lying.  How

do you know that, Doctor?

HELEN

Because people who are suffering

from aural hallucinations hear

voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee

told me that Joan of Arc always

appeared beside him on his left

side and spoke softly in his left

ear.

HELEN

(emboldened)

He took pains to hide his actions

because he knew they were morally

wrong.  He was not acting on mad

impulse.  He was sane and acting

out a pattern he carefully followed

every time.

ATTORNEY

(playing causal)

What pattern was that?

HELEN

The same as the first time...

ATTORNEY

The first what?

(as she hesitates)

Your Honor, she's got this far, I

think she should finish.  I don't

think this jury should be left

wondering where the rest of her

statement would lead.

JUDGE

I agree, Doctor.

HELEN

The first two murders.

ATTORNEY

What first two murders.  We don't

know about them here, do we?

HELEN

(giving up)

He told me he had done two others

just like it.

ATTORNEY

When was that?

HELEN

When he was seventeen.

ATTORNEY

And you believed him when he told

you he had done that.

HELEN

Yes.  I believed him.

JUDGE (V.O.)

Yes, I'll accept a call for a

mistrial.  Evidence of that other

crime when the defendant was a

juvenile is inadmissible and never

should have been heard by this

jury...

QUINN

There was no sperm.

M.J.

The same as the firs two.

Definitely a serial.

QUINN

(seeing HELEN on

video)

What are you looking at that for?

Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.

M.J.

What clues?  I'm going to work

Helen Hudson.

QUINN

Would you step outside, Sergeant?

QUINN

I'm

telling

ever

address me publicly in that tone.

You'll work what and

who

to work.

M.J.

Anybody in this department ever

worked a serial killer case?  She's

the expert.  I need help.

QUINN

How about I put Nikko on it?

M.J.

That's always your privilege, sir.

QUINN

Sergeant?

M.J.

Yessir.

QUINN

You ever reflect how this big

explosion in dead women coincides

with the flowering of women's lib?

M.J.

Yessir.  I have reflected on that,

sir.  Which explains my gushing

deference to you, sir.

QUINN

Nikko's looking better by the

minute, Inspector.

CUT TO:

HELEN

Oh, God.  I must have looked

horrible.

ANDY

No, dear.  You're at your best with

a bag in front of your face.

HELEN

I want to die.

ANDY

I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you

want him.  The cute brutal type

with handcuffs.  Very sexy.

ANDY

You thought he was cute too, didn't

you?  Admit... admit...

ANDY

What?  What'd I do?

HELEN

Reminded me that I used to be

attractive.  That men used to want

me...

ANDY

You

slut

!  No sexy young cop for

you unless you shampoo your hair.

ANDY

When are you going to call them?

HELEN

(big beat)

About what?

HELEN

I can't, Andy.

ANDY

Then, why don't you just die.  I'm

going.  They'll find your body

years later, the old recluse lady,

she ate cat food, ten years of the

New York Times, unread, piled on

top of the unread mail, the TV

still on.  Make up your mind.  Live

or die.

(beat)

I'll get coffee.

ANDY (O.S.)

Yes?  Inspector Halloran, she's

going through the material now.

(beat)

She'll call you... No, she'll be

alright, I'll sleep over on the

couch in case.  But now, I told

you, singing like a lark.

CUT TO:

NIKKO

Working late.

(no response)

You're a damn fool.

M.J.

(preoccupied)

Oh, I know.

NIKKO

You're almost ten years older than

he is.

NIKKO

It's none of my business anymore...

M.J.

You got that right, Nikko, it's

none of your business.

NIKKO

You're shitting ion your career.  You

outrank hi...

M.J.

Well, you outranked

me

, Nikko.

NIKKO

Yeah.  And you used that. Used

me

M.J.

Don't put yourself down like that.

I

never

up like a marine grunt!

NIKKO

Yeah, you did that too.  You earned

what you got; don't shit on it,

that's all I'm saying.

M.J.

(maddeningly)

God, you're cute when you're mad.

NIKKO

Think about it.

RUBEN

What's wrong with him?

M.J.

He's just mad he let me keep the

espresso machine.  We heard from

Doctor Hudson?

RUBEN

Nada.  Lemme make the call.

M.J.

Honest to God, Ruben!

RUBEN

I like women like that!

M.J.

Tell it to your shrink.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HELEN (V.O.)

The way he's posed the bodies...

he's flaunting his power to do

whatever he wants to her.  This

man... He probably seems perfectly

normal.  These murders are organized

and planned.

HELEN

Except for this one.  You put that

one in to test me.

HELEN (V.O.)

Is it an ongoing case?

M.J.

(nods)

For months... last October.

HELEN

It was a lover or a husband.

Someone close.  Somebody who knew

her and cared about her.

M.J.

(glancing at Ruben)

How do you know that?

HELEN

He felt remorse.  He covered her.

HELEN

The bodies have been carefully

arranged... different positions,

but somehow the same.  The

positions are brutal... yet

quite... artful.  It's like... a

signature.  He's proud of his

accomplishments.  There are early

Picassos and late Picassos, but you

always recognize the hand.  He

wants us to recognize

his

I've seen this hand before... what

are you hiding?

M.J.

(taken aback)

Nothing.

HELEN

Where are the stockings he

strangled them with?

M.J.

How did you know they were

stockings?

HELEN

(sarcastic)

I sent Andy out on murder missions.

For God's sake -- it's the Boston

Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used

their own stockings to strangle

them.  Tied in a bow-knot.

HELEN

Somebody is imitating his m.o.

Look for a plumber or carpenter or

handyman; that's how deSalvo got in

the door and caught them off guard.

RUBEN

The Boston Strangler, when was

that...?

HELEN

In the sixties.  He's dead --

stabbed to death in prison.

M.J.

Why imitate a dead serial killer?

HELEN

If you knew why, you might know

where to look for him.

I don't envy you this; he's not

done -- he's going to do them faster

and faster to keep the adrenaline

rush.  Now, I've done what you

asked me.

M.J.

Work with me.

ANDY (O.S.)

It's good for you.

ANDY

It's good medicine.

RUBEN

A little homeopathic cure for the

willies.

HELEN

(exhausted)

None of you know anything about it.

Now go.  And Andy, if you persist

in playing doctor, leave, with

them.

ANDY

I'm the only friend you've got,

darling, and I don't intend to stop

doing what I think is good for us.

HELEN

Get out!  All of you!

RUBEN

You said you don't give a fuck and

that's the beauty of a breakdown?

This doesn't look like not giving a

fuck, you know that?

M.J.

Let's get out of here...

HELEN (V.O.)

(small voice)

Andy!  Please.  Don't

you

QUINN

Aw, Jesus.  The Mouth gets a load

of this and we got major headlines

around the world.  deSalvo redux.

The matter, you think they don't

teach Latin in Catholic schools?

M.J.

Don't swear at me because we got

problems.  I'm just giving you the

news.  I went to a Catholic school;

I'll tell you what they teach.  On

the knuckles they teach.

QUINN

Who've I got to beat up except the

messenger?  Does this give us

anything to go on?

M.J.

I'm checking out anybody who lives

like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests

for rape, especially by a man

wearing green.  Checking out

psychiatric hospitals for his

personality profile.  Cross check-

ing names from arrests for sexual

offenses, public fondling.  If

they've got a German wife.  We can

keep cops working on this kind of

junk for years, and this guy's

going to hit again, soon.

QUINN

(morose)

I know.  Get out here.

M.J.

So.  Do we tell the media and hope

for somebody to come forward with

information?

QUINN

Or for some new nutcase to copycat

the copycat.

RUBEN

What I love, the big fight, some

girl, she drops the quarter on her

boyfriend so the bastard spends the

night in custody, just to teach him

a lesson.  We'll get a shitload of

those.

QUINN

Another country heard from.

(deciding)

No.  We're keeping it quiet, don't

give the bastard the attention he's

maybe begging for.

ANDY

She's in the office...

HELEN

That's the face of the next one

he'll kill.

M.J.

How do you know that?

HELEN

(can't look at it)

Look at the bottom of the screen.

You see the icon with the arrow

pointing left?  Click on that...

twice.

M.J.

How did you do that?

HELEN

That computer's wired into

INTERNET.

RUBEN

He's hacked into her Internet

address.  He's a hacker.

HELEN

(rocking, rocking)

He can get into my computer any

time he likes!  This is exactly the

kind of thing I didn't want to have

happen.

M.J.

Can you make a copy we can show on

our computers?

HELEN

It's too big a file to copy to a

disk.

RUBEN

You got a tape backup, yeah, here

lemme copy it on tape...

M.J.

Why would he send this to Helen

Hudson...

HELEN

It's a game they like to play.

Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung

around the crime scene, talking to

the cops.  This one's probably

watching

you

, laughing at you.

RUBEN

Let me get a little action started

here.

M.J.

I'm going to put a guard on your

door.

HELEN

One officer already got killed

trying to protect me.  Please, just

take it all away.  Leave me alone.

M.J.

He

RUBEN

Look at this...

HELEN

It's gone.  The file's not here.

(to Ruben)

What did you do?

RUBEN

I just started it copying to tape,

but the tape never ran.  It just

did that...

HELEN

(respect)

He's brilliant.  This one is

brilliant.

M.J.

We'll show that to...

HELEN

Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a

self destruct virus into the code,

so it would only play until we try

to copy it.  Then it erased itself.

Gone...

(beat)

Do you remember what you saw?

CUT TO:

QUINN

He's on the phone calling me like an

insurance salesman soliciting my

business, for Christ's sake.  I

didn't tell him the three most

over-rated things in life are young

pussy, regular exercise and the

F.B.I.

M.J.

Oh, maaaaan?!

QUINN

What?  I talk like a cop, this is

the way I talk.  I can't believe

this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy

Assistant Director of the F.B.I.

"Let me help you!"

M.J.

We could use a little help.

QUINN

With the F.B.I. there's no such

thing as a little help.  They bury

you with help.  Explain to me about

this virus, no don't tell me about

the virus.  Thing is, you saw it,

the pictures.

M.J.

We saw it.  The unknown target is

kneeling, she's gardening.  Red

hair, high cheekbones, mid-

thirties, height I don't know,

she's not overweight, she's

zofting... She's in front of a

house that looks like...

CUT TO:

M.J. (V.O.)

... the Marina area, there was

earthquake damage repair on the

house it looked like, a little

garden.  The light was late

afternoon.  Say about cocktail

hour.  He was bringing out drinks,

margaritas by the look.  So we got

a house facing west, on the east

side of the street.  Full sun, so

there's no high trees or buildings,

residential both sides.

CUT TO:

HUSBAND

Stupid goddam s-stupid p-poker

game!  Always have to s-stay until

Phil makes a c...comeback.  Am I

stuttering?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ANDY

She just got to sleep.  Do you have

to tell her about it now?

M.J.

Tell her about

what

?

ANDY

(mock admiration)

Gaahhd!  What a

cop

!  You busted

me!

(real)

The new one, in the Marina.

(to their reaction)

She has a police radio scanner.

It's always on.  She turns it off,

and then she has to turn it on

again.  She's obsessed.  She can't

not listen to it, but she can't

listen to it, so she makes me

listen to it.

HELEN

I am not going to look at any more

pictures.  They're like a disease.

They get into my head.  I can't get

them out.

M.J.

I don't look at pictures.  I look

at the

real thing

.  I don't feel

infected.

HELEN

Maybe that's why you can't catch

him.  I

know

the red-headed woman in my

computer.

M.J.

I just came from her... here's what

you haven't seen.

M.J. (cont'd)

A forgery of the Mary Sullivan

murder scene, he's done it perfect.

Except for the sign.

HELEN

(looking at photo)

She probably let him in the door

without a thought.  Where are their

mothers?!  Where are the mothers

that are supposed to teach them to

be wary and to tough and not afraid

to fight?

M.J.

Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the

Festival of Love?  You make any

sense in that?

M.J. (cont'd)

For 'Hell', read 'Helen'.  He's

talking to you.

HELEN

It's

anybody

ity.  They write, they even knock

on your door.  They're

fans

.  It

thrills them to flirt with getting

caught.

M.J.

Nobody knows you have anything to

do with this case; nothing has been

on TV or the news... Why would he

want to get in

your

HELEN

Because I'm his damned pin-up girl!

His, all of them!  They know me.

They're in prisons with libraries,

they collect clippings, I'm their

worthy opponent.  You keep my name

out of this.

RUBEN

Absolutely.

M.J.

My promise.

ANDY

The moon is up, my night to howl.

Will you be okay?

HELEN

Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You

go.  Poor thing, you ought to get

out.

ANDY

(to M.J.)

Look out for her.  She's tougher

than you think.

HELEN

I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest

of it?

RUBEN

MaryJane.  We call her M.J.

HELEN

MaryJane.  You think that logic and

police procedure, order and science

and method will hold back the

horrors of a world gone mad and the

sickness of the night.  I did once.

But you know how he'll get caught?

He'll have an accident, or some cop

will get lucky.  You can't catch

him by being intelligent and

working hard.  Or the worst:  there

are dozens of women slaughtered in

the most horrible way, month after

month.  The news stories grow more

grotesque and bizarre and in the

city people lock their doors and

windows, and hurry home before

dark.  And then, one day, there are

no more.  What happened?  Did he

just stop?  Get tired and disgusted

and decide not to kill any more?

Did he kill himself?  Did he die in

an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or

get sick and die?  It's like the

murderer walked off the edge of the

earth.  And you never know.  But

you keep asking yourself -- when you

read about a new murder -- is he

back?

M.J.

That's amazing.  A whole new book,

thought up in a minute.  Very good.

(beat)

All I know how t do is get up,

take a shower, and go to work.

Hope, if he does another I'll nail

the son of bitch, and they'll spell

my name right in the newspaper.

Where is Andy going?

HELEN

He's going home.  He slept over

because I was a little anxious...

M.J.

I want a guard on you.  I'm worried

about leaving you alone.

RUBEN

(to M.J.)

We're through for the night, aren't

we?  You go on.  Get some sleep.

I'll stay until we can get a man

out here and maybe catch a cab

home.

HELEN

That would be much appreciated.

Thanks.

M.J.

(to Helen)

Somewhere down the line we're doing

to find a connection between him

and you.  I want you to worry that

idea like a loose tooth.

CUT TO:

RUBEN

You ought to get some decent locks

on these.  A six-year-old could get

in here.  Much less a motivated

man.

HELEN

You and MaryJane aren't lovers.

RUBEN

Not yet.

laughter

,

HELEN

Are you always so bold?

RUBEN

No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.

RUBEN

The problem for me is... you're in

the witness category.

(beat -- Jack

Nicholson)

Know what I mean?

HELEN

Well.  Another time, then.

(beat)

I'll be all right.  He's not going

to attack me; what I' m rally

afraid of is all in my own head,

Ruben.

CUT TO:

RUBEN

They'll have a guard here tomorrow.

I know you have the idea, but it'll

make me feel a lot better.

RUBEN

Hey!

RUBEN

The number for my cellular.

RUBEN

Don't hesitate.

Anytime

.  Night or

day.  I mean that.

HELEN

Oh, God!  Help me!

RUBEN

Tell me what to do!

HELEN

I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!

HELEN

...falling... FALLING!

RUBEN

I'm right here.  I won't let you

fall.

HELEN

Don't let go... I can't breathe...

I'll die!

RUBEN

Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe.

I'll fix it...

RUBEN

Put your hands over your ears.

HELEN

The lock...

RUBEN

I'll get a locksmith.

HELEN

Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid

to sleep... I don't want...

Why don't we save it for later?

It's almost time for Letterman.

You know I don't like to watch talk

WOMAN

See, now you've annoyed her.  You

know she doesn't like you to touch

me.

(to dog)

Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve

you so much!

(to Peter)

Did you feed her?

PETER

Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's

hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.

WOMAN

She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed

her?

PETER

She lies all the time.  Why would I

say I fed her if I didn't?

WOMAN

That's what I don't know.  Why

would you lie?  That's the

problem... I can't understand why

anyone would lie.

WOMAN (cont'd)

You wouldn't lie to Mummy, would

you?  Just to get Dad in trouble?

Such a naughty widdle dog...

PETER

Didn't I promise I'd come right

back?

CUT TO:

RUBEN

Up all night with a sick friend.

NIKKO

You dumb son of a bitch!  You don't

even know how to treat a woman.

RUBEN

Who?  M.J.?  Hey, Nikko, explain to

me why she gave you the boot...

RUBEN

Is Niccoletti

assigned

M.J.

(angry about it)

Quinn decided we should form a task

force -- they're all one case, now.

He wants all the senior detectives

on it...

(to Doc)

She wasn't killed here.

DOC

Not likely.

M.J.

Tell me what you see.

RUBEN

She didn't fight back, no hair or

skin under her fingernails.  I'm

not seeing any bruises or

contusions...

M.J.

What about her arms?

RUBEN

Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at

this...

NIKKO

Probably so stoned she never knew

what got her.  Like Goetz's sick

friend.  Right Goetz?

RUBEN

She's blue as hell.  No marks on her

neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same --

no ligature marks.  Outdoors...

M.J.

Look at her legs.

RUBEN

Spread out like she was sexually

assaulted here.

DOC

After she was dead.

RUBEN

She was dragged up here from the

road, you can see the tracks.  She

was already dead or unconscious.

Let's get plaster casts on any --

all footprints.

M.J.

If this is just the dump site,

where did he do the job?  Where did

he pick her up?

NIKKO

Doped up kids all over town.  Park

was full of them last night.  Very

easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.

M.J.

What the hell are you doing?  The

Mouth and the Haircut are right

down there, thank God they didn't

see that.

M.J.

Niccoletti, they're on the wrong

side of the tape, you want to push

them back?  Now.

M.J.

Ruben, my God, I ought to put you

on report.

RUBEN

You're right.  I can't stand that

bastard.  Sorry.

(getting back to

work)

This is something new.  Not the

same guy, that's for sure.

M.J.

Yeah, everything's different.

M.J.

Get the pictures, and casts of

footprints.

RUBEN

Look at him, grandstanding...

M.J.

That's

M.J.

Detective Niccoletti?

SUSAN

What's this about the Boston

Strangler, M.J.?

M.J.

Hey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on

the wrong side of the tape.  We're

still trying to find any footprints

or tire marks and we don't want to

chew up the ground, okay?  I'll

talk to you later.

(to Nikko)

You, too.

SUSAN

Inspector, will you confirm

somebody is copying the Boston

Strangler?  This is the fourth, is

that correct?

M.J.

We're going to review all the

evidence carefully before making

any statement...

M.J.

Ruben, put the light on...

M.J.

Now listen up, Ruben.  You never,

never, never mess with somebody

inside

RUBEN

Excuse me?

Excuse me

?!  What do

you...

M.J.

You damn well better start working

on that impulse control.  A woman

who is implicated in this case?

Someone who's practically a piece

of

evidence

?

RUBEN

It's against your rules that I try

to help a witness who's scared

shitless?  Who's...

M.J.

The woman's unstable.  You could

wind up with a harassment charge.

Anything

.  You're like some horny

little teenager.

M.J.

Anybody who's ever watched TV knows

about that corner.

M.J.

Everybody could see you -- unshaved,

same clothes from yesterday,

reeking of sex.

M.J.

(going away)

Park the car.  Call the lab.  Get

Doc to lean on the coroner for a

really fast prelim on the sperm.

M.J. (O.S.)

When you get it, call me.

RUBEN

She loves me.

CUT TO:

QUINN

I know; the kid hit you first.  He

already told me.

NIKKO

He's not treating her right...

QUINN

She left you, Nikko.  She's not

your responsibility.  She takes

very good care of herself.  If she

wants to romance the kid, it ain't

your business.  Your business is to

snap out of it.

NIKKO

We were together six years, sir!

QUINN

Don't give me six years!  You never

divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd

you expect from M.J.?

NIKKO

She knows I'm Catholic!  She never

mentioned divorce!  Not once!

QUINN

Then you shoulda known she wasn't

buying.  She was just long-term

leasing' you.

(beat)

Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare

twenty-second twitch, there ain't

nothin' about sex I don't hate.

But of course, I'm Irish.

(beat)

Plus I got

real

worried I might have to put you in

over M.J.  There's something going on

here, the Commissioner is targeting

her now, I can't leave a woman in

that position.  But the thing is,

how can I move

you

acting like a teenage asshole?

NIKKO

I don't want the job.  Don't do

that to her.  She's worked too

damned hard for it.

QUINN

What's going down with the sting in

Chinatown?  That gonna be off your

plate in a week or what?

CUT TO:

QUINN (V.O.)

Sergeant...

QUINN

So what have we got?

M.J.

It's not the same guy.  It should be

a self-solver.  No bow around the

neck, left and body outdoors,

completely different.  The others

were housewives, secretaries, he

talked his way inside, killed them

in their own living room or bed- or

bathroom.  This one didn't have a

husband or a boyfriend, no family,

temp waitress, 3 arrests for

misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI,

asphyxiation probably from a

plastic bag over her head.  Sexually

assaulted.  The others weren't

molested that way.  We're waiting

for the sperm tests...

QUINN

Christ.  How old are you?  You sure

you want to be in this line of

work?

M.J.

You're damn right I do.

QUINN

Okay, now what about your sidekick

punching my favorite detective?

What the hell is going on?  You got

no discipline in your operation.

M.J.

I'm sorry it had to come to your

attention.  I am dealing with it.

QUINN

Where you going?

M.J.

Helen Hudson...

QUINN

What the hell you need her for?

M.J.

Because I think I'm wrong.

CUT TO:

HELEN

I'm not seeing anybody.

HELEN

You're fired.

ANDY

I know.  Do come and meet your

guest.

M.J.

We've got another one.

HELEN

That's no surprise.

M.J.

But it's a different m.o.

HELEN

Then what do you need me for?

M.J.

She was killed somewhere else and

Where it says "no dumping."  Her

legs pulled apart in a kind of

sexual pose.   It's all different

but it seems so -- the same.

Artificial and

posed

... Something's

wrong with it.

HELEN

You're saying it's the same man,

but he's changed his style?  That

doesn't happen.  These men are

robotic; the murder is like a

ritual.  The method itself is part

of the pleasure...

M.J.

Who turned off the Internet

computer...

HELEN

I turned it off.  It's like an open

window he can climb right in...

M.J.

He comes in the window, we maybe

grab him.  Where's the on-switch?

HELEN

Have you got a warrant?  Get the

hell out o here!  This is the

only space I have left in the

world

!  Why can't you leave me out

of it?

M.J.

Helen -- the killer directly

contacted you.  His interest in you

is

intense

.  I'm worried about you.

I don't want to lose you.  I know

this stirs up every monster under

the bed, but this is the only

direct contact we have with him.

The only chance we have to trap

him.

(beat)

So, you can turn Internet back on,

or I do, and we put somebody here

on a 24 hour shift and you can

kick, scream and hyperventilate.

HELEN

That little Winona Ryder manner...

you're more convincing as Clint

Eastwood.

M.J.

Clint is putting a guard on you.

But if you swear to leave the

computer on, Winona will assign him

to the hall outside.

ANDY

She's smoking again.

HELEN

Hello?... Oh...

(a beat)

...yes, she's right here.

HELEN

Ruben.

M.J.

Hello, Ruben...

(listens, nods)

So that's that...

HELEN

Please thank Inspector Goetz for

taking care of me last night.

M.J.

Ruben, Dr. Hudson wants me to

thank you for taking care of her

last night.

(hangs up)

Lab report on the new one.  At

least two guys penetrated her.

There were

two

poor thing.  What it must have been

like.

HELEN

She was near a sign that said "No

Dumping?"  Two kinds of sperm --

the lab said one was a secretor and

the other was not?

HELEN

There were needle marks.  But no

drugs in her blood.

M.J.

So far nothing they test for comes

up positive.

HELEN

Is that it?

M.J.

(stunned)

That's exactly... I could have

taken that same picture, this

morning.

HELEN

He's switched from DeSalvo to the

Hillside Strangler.  The Strangler

was two men, that's why there are

two kinds of sperm.  His idea of a

joke, very witty our boy.

M.J.

That's not consistent... You said

they never changed their style,

they're robots...

HELEN

Consistency is the hobgoblin of

little

for the chemicals found in Windex.

That's a product for cleaning

with...

M.J.

I know Windex, for God's sake, I

clean my own windows...

HELEN

It's what Bianchi and Buono

injected into one of their victims.

M.J.

(sensing something

appalling)

Injected Windex!  Why would he

switch to a new m.o.?

HELEN

Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half

way to nailing him.  Serial killing

is irrational and rigid and

compulsive.  This guy has a plan

all thought out, flexible and

complex.  He's playing a game with

us.  Who will he imitate next?

Maybe he's doing all the serial

killers in history, the great

innovators, the murderers' hall of

fame.  Just to prove he's better

than all of them.  They got caught;

he didn't.

M.J.

He'll get caught.  If he has a plan

that'll be what trips him up...

HELEN

Who's going to catch him?  You?

(beat)

And if you do, there'll be another

one.  And one after that.

M.J.

(gently, surprised)

You're afraid of him.

HELEN

This one, yes.  I was always

curious about these twisted little

souls, but this is the first one

I've felt personally terrified of.

He's something new and unheard of.

I don't know what he wants.

M.J.

(beat)

I'm giving you Clint outside.

CUT TO:

SUSAN

...to mimic the M.O. of the Boston

Strangler.  The police here are

rumored to be consulting Dr. Helen

Hudson.

SUSAN (ON TV)

It was backstage at the McClusky

Auditorium on the Berkeley campus

that Dr. Hudson's police bodyguard

was killed.  Daryll Lee Cullum,

that...

SUSAN (ON TV)

... convicted serial killer had

escaped police custody during a

court hearing, in a scandal that

rocked the police and forced the

resignation of four State

Correction officers...

SUSAN (ON TV)

...Cullum attacked Doctor Hudson in

apparent revenge for her testimony

against him.  Doctor Hudson did not

return our phone calls, today.  Our

sources tell us that if police

homicide detectives fail to move

faster in their investigation the

FBI will be called...

M.J.

Halloran.

HELEN

You betrayed me!  Now every

psychopath in the city knows I'm

back in business... You lied to me!

M.J.

I did not; the Mouth -- that's what

we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on

her own.

HELEN

Why should I trust you?

M.J.

Because I'm all you've got.

HELEN

How could you...

M.J.

(out of patience)

I like the real smart Helen Hudson

a lot, I'm Goddamned sick and

tired of the hysterical little

girl, Helen.  You asked your way in

-- I don't forget that.  You've got

a nickname around here -- "Deep

Throat" from all the phone calls, I

wonder if you know that.  Go take a

xanax, I've got to got to work.

and Horgan, woman dead in car.  Can

we have homicide?  All units go to

channel 5.  Leave channel 3 clear

for homicide... etc.

TECH GUY

Pulled this out of the door, it's

bigger than a .38; it's a .44 or 9

millimeter.

M.J.

Was this on?  When you found the

car was the tape player on or off.

COP (V.O.)

It was on, auto-reverse, over and

over.

RUBEN

Yeah?... I can't talk now...

What?... No.  There's no sexual

assault, it's a drive-by, a woman

in a car, it's not him.

(mouths to M.J.)

Helen

.

HELEN (V.O.)

It's a woman shot in a car?

RUBEN

Yes.  I have to go...

HELEN

She on the passenger side?

M.J.

(shouting to be

heard)

Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on

with his work...

HELEN

What's that music.  It's Abba.  I

can hear it.  It's Abba.

RUBEN

What's Abba?

M.J.

Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too

young.

HELEN

Don't hang up!

RUBEN

What

?...

HELEN

Listen to me.  Is there a gas

station nearby?

RUBEN

Yes.

HELEN

Is there a phone booth there?

RUBEN

They all have one...

HELEN

Go and look for a note.

RUBEN

She wants me to check the phone

booth for a note.

M.J.

Helen... excuse me, we...

HELEN

She was listening to Abba in her

parked car when she was shot with a

Bulldog .44.

M.J.

Tony!

M.J.

Let me see the slug outta the door!

M.J.

What's that siren?

HELEN (V.O.)

One of those goddamned car alarms.

What's going...

M.J.

Ruben's gone to look... It's banged

up but it looks like a .44.  It's

Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?

HELEN

Look in the crowd.  He liked to

hang around and watch the cops at

work...

RUBEN

"Police: let me haunt you with

these words:  I'll be back."

RUBEN

Hold on a minute, Helen...

HELEN

.  M.J. takes phone from RUBEN, forcing herself to

M.J.

Helen, Ruben's going to drop by.

He's got some questions.

M.J.

Answer me!!...

M.J.

I need a unit at 19809 Lorenda

Drive.  Tell them to approach code

2 and wait for instruction.  Find

the goddamn officer supposed to be

on security.  Ruben's on his way.

He'll go in alone.

CUT TO:

MAN

I can explain!

RUBEN

The fuck you can!

(shouts)

Helen!  Are you okay?  HELEN!

RUBEN

Did this animal touch you?

RUBEN

Turn on a light and call in the

unit.

NOW

!

MAN

No gun!

RUBEN

Bullshit's gonna get your balls

stomped on!  What's your name?

MAN

Chow.  Conrad Chow.

MAN

Swear to God!

Conrad Chow

.  Never

carry a gun.

BURT

Backup's here...

RUBEN

(to Burt)

Then you get your ass outta here, I

don't wanta see you again...

CONRAD

I brought a present for the lady,

there.  I'm looking for her, to give

her the present...

RUBEN

You break into her apartment to

deliver a gift?  Where is it?

CONRAD

The door was open, swear to God,

I'm just looking for her when you

come charging up the stairs...

RUBEN

Where is it?

CONRAD

I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the

lady's pillow...

CONRAD

Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that

book, he wanted the lady to have

it.  They won't let him send it to

her, so I'm getting out, he asks me

to deliver it in person, he says,

put it on her pillow.  It has all

about how he tried to kill her.

RUBEN

He told you she was loaded, any-

thing you could steal you could

keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself

a return ticket to Quentin,

breaking and entering.

CONRAD

The door was already open...

RUBEN

We know...

(to a cop)

Send the book to evidence...

CONRAD

She's supposed to have it.

RUBEN

She don't want it.

RUBEN (V.O.)

Helen?  Open the door.  The guy's

nothing.  A burglar.

RUBEN (V.O.)

Open the door.  Please.

HELEN

Why don't you shoot off the lock?

HELEN

He was in my apartment!

RUBEN

I know, baby.  I know.

RUBEN

It's okay... you're safe with me!

RUBEN

When I was a little kid, and I'd be

in a state, my father would hold me

on his lap, until all the fight

would go out of me...

HELEN

You think you're my Daddy?

RUBEN

Helen...honey, you know I gotta go.

RUBEN

You know how to use this?

HELEN

They taught me at the FBI.  I was

very good at it.  It scared me... I

liked it.

RUBEN

You take it, hang on to it, it'll

make you feel safer.  Stay put.

HELEN

What else?

SAKS

Hello.  I am (research title)

Meryhew Saks.  The song is called

"Murder By Numbers."  The

performers are a group called The

Police.  Adam here...

... from Behavioral Science is

working out exactly what this

perpetrator is trying to telegraph

in the note.  This is an extremely

complex case, and we have a lot of

fancy theories floating around.

We're not ruling out the possib-

ility of three Copycat serial

killers.  We have Quantico working

on graphology, the Washington lap

is cloning DNA from the secretor.

It's our feeling that the best lead

we have is the two sperm samples in

one of the victims.  We have a team

sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want

to say a few word to you local

people.  Your Commissioner asked

for our assistance.  The Bureau

does not send us in on these cases

to lord it over the local police.

We couldn't catch up on what you

people know if we had a year.  We

have nation-wide resources and hard

state of the art forensic science;

you have the local savvy.  Together

we can be unbeatable.  Which one is

Inspector Halloran?

M.J.

Over here.

SAKS

We don't see too many lady homicide

detectives.  You have

my

Have you discussed the note with

Dr. Hudson?

M.J.

Someone broke into her place last

night.  It wasn't connected to our

case, but it shook her up pretty

bad so I haven't...

SAKS

I was just about to advise the

Inspector here not to show Dr.

Hudson the note.

M.J.

Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a

pattern develop...

SAKS

(riding over her)

We know Helen.  She's not exactly a

credible collaborator.  Especially

late in the day...

M.J.

She takes tranquilizers her doctor

prescribes.

SAKS

Who prescribes the brandy?

M.J.

How come you're so up on Dr.

Hudson?

SAKS

She is a writer, writing best

selling books about serial killing.

Giving lectures she's well-paid

for.  Her interests are not the

interests of law enforcement.

M.J.

Okay.

SAKS

We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's

phone.  I know you won't mention

it.

QUINN

Sorry to interrupt.  I need a word

with my officer...

QUINN

M.J., I'm going to have to borrow

Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing

in Chinatown is going down tomorrow

night and Jack's kid got hit by a

car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.

M.J.

What does this mean?  Now we got

the FBI, my team is expendable?

I'm working my ass off, is anybody

listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He

and Nikko don't even get on

together...

QUINN

Teach both of them a lesson in

cooperation and self-discipline.

M.J.

If this is a first step in kicking

me off the case, just tell me, to

my face, sir, don't waste time

being diplomatic.

QUINN

Just, I need results.  And -- I am

short-handed.  Who else am I gonna

give him?

M.J.

(looking at Saks)

Give him

that

pompous son of a

bitch.

GIGI

Lab called.  They got a result on

the drug test you requested...?

GIGI

They said it was Windex?

CUT TO:

HELEN

..."I'll be back..."

M.J.

Yeah.  Addressed to you.  "Don't

lose your head."

HELEN

They put  Merry

Saks

M.J.

He said to send you his regards and

to tell you that the Bureau holds

you in the highest esteem.

HELEN

What I can't believe is that in an

earlier life I slept with him!

Christ!  Any God that loved his

people would give women a rewind on

their life and an erase button.

(looks at M.J.)

Just give me a minute here.  The

letter is addressed to me...

(she's breathing

fast, controls it)

You don't feel fear, do you?

You're young.  You feel like you'll

live forever.  How wonderful.

M.J.

I put my ass on the line, giving

you that.

HELEN

They weren't going to show it to

me?!  The arrogance!  It's my

life

!

M.J.

It's also the major piece of

evidence, and it makes you a key

part of his plan.  You can't run

away from it anymore.

(beat)

Look at the order he's doing

Strangler just to tell us a copycat

serial killer was at work.  Then he

did one like the Hillside Strang-

ler.  And then one as Son of Sam.

To lead us on -- to where and what

end?  And he's doing more than that

-- he's imitating each killer's

method as closely as he can -- in

details.  Injecting Windex.  Using

.44.  Playing Abba.

HELEN

It's not chronological: Son of Sam

was before Hillside.

M.J.

It's clear he thinks he knows me.

He lives a fantasy.  'Helen, don't

lose your head.'  Is that a threat?

Does he want to cut off my head?

Dahmer cut off heads.  Who else?

Kemper.  Did Gacy?  Rivkind?  I

think Rivkind did.

HELEN

He attacks what he feels he can't

have.  What he feels excluded

from...

HELEN (V.O.)

'First you make a stone of your

heart.'... Oh yes!

He

suffer.  That's past.  Now it's our

turn.

HELEN (V.O.)

Kemper said in order to have the

experience he wanted with them, he

needed to evict them from their

bodies.  By making the body a

completely passive object, he

releases

himself

HELEN

But the relief he feels is only

temporary.  '...Before your

conscience bothers you much

less...'  But the tension always

comes back.

(she now picks out

the words:)

'You can join the ranks of the

illustrious...'  He wants to be

like

them

.  The best.  To become

the best.  But, he has his own

desires, his own compulsions apart

from theirs.'  His own horrors...

CUT TO:

HELEN (V.O.)

Some horrors that are all his

own...

HELEN (V.O.)

He needs to prove they don't

control him, that he's the one in

control.  But the feeling of power

never lasts.  He can control his

victims, but he can't control

anything else... his place in the

world.  He want s to be recognized.

He puts messages in my computer; he

sends me a letter...

HELEN

Of course he wants to do a

threesome!  Only Bundy did three in

one day.  Is Bundy next?  But Bundy

should be last... the grand finale.

What about Kemper and Ramirez?

Gacy, Dahmer, Williams?  Rivkind?

Who else is on his list?  In what

order?

Not

guilty

!' gesture, then makes a peace sign.  The girls giggle

HELEN

'...great dark hall of fame... all

our greatest killers...'  His

greatest

heroes

?  He wants to be

famous.  When they're caught and

people like me write about them, we

give them a kind of immortality.

They get thousands of letters.

Ramirez kills eight women and gets

a hundred marriage proposals a

month.  They're like film stars.

M.J.

They get fan letters...

CUT TO:

FELIX

We keep records of any threatening

or illegal correspondence, like

relatives of victims who might want

to send the condemned man some

strychnine cookies.  So it's only a

partial list, but you're still

looking at about forty pages...

HELEN (V.O.)

Would you fax those pages to me?

M.J.

Thank you for your help, Warden

Hillyer.  As soon as you can.

GIGI

Hot off the fax.  Mr. Rivkind's

fans.

CUT TO:

HELEN (V.O.)

If we keep going and work till

midnight...

ANDY (O.S.)

Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.

HELEN (O.S.)

You've got a date right

here

, Andy.

This has got to...

ANDY

It's almost six.  And guess what?

Hall likes me bathed and shaved.

HELEN

Stop acting like a silly little

fag!

ANDY

My life to live, darling, try to

remember what it was like way, way

back when you were young and sexy

and

alive

.

HELEN

You bastard!

ANDY

But alive!

CUT TO:

HELEN (V.O.)

The dirty bastard!  More games!

CUT TO:

HELEN (O.S.)

It's not a real name: it's the name

of a mass murderer in Germany in

the 1930s.  They called him the

Monster of Dusseldorf.

HELEN

Let's speed up the game plan...

call all the living serials to ask

if they've had contact with a Peter

Kurten.  We could use some help on

the phones...

M.J.

They're not talking to me.  Saks

looks right through me.  I ask him

for some bodies, for the phones --

he's so encouraging: "you make that

your

bastard.

(careful)

Helen, on your lists to call is San

Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?

HELEN

(beat)

You do that one, I don't want it...

CUT TO:

MITCHELL

Sergeant Halloran is it?  I've

got a list of Daryll Lee's

correspondents.  There is a

Peter Kurten among them.

Daryll Lee claims he has

information about Kurten, but

he'll only talk to Dr. Hudson

personally.  Nobody else.  The

creep's been studying his

amendments.  My guess is he

doesn't have zip.  Just

angling for a chance to ask if

her bra size is still the

same.  We get this shit all

the time, but it's her call.

M.J.

Thanks, Warden.

(determined)

She'll talk to him.

M.J.

Do those things really help?

HELEN

Not a damn bit...

INTERCUT TO:

DARYLL LEE

Hey, Doc!  How you doing?

HELEN

Hello, Daryll Lee.

DARYLL

You read my book which as you know,

hit the stands a couple of weeks

ago.  You read it yet.

HELEN

What book?

DARYLL

(indignant)

I sent it by private courier, he

didn't give it to you?  That son of

a gun...!

HELEN

I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.

DARYLL

Bet you never figured I'd follow in

your footsteps.  It's real well-

written.  You should read it --

you're in it.

HELEN

I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and

talk to you about it after I've

read it.  Right now I have a

question... Peter Kurten.

DARYLL

Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I

told that son I'd send him what he

wanted if he leave you alone.

HELEN

Ah ha.  What did he want?

DARYLL

Something personal.  Is he bothering

you?

HELEN

I don't know.  I'd like to know

where he is.

DARYLL

Listen, you want my advice?  Steer

clear.  He's writing me he's gonna

finish 'my unfinished symphony.'

He's gonna give me $550 for some of

my cum, he says he's in a position

to see that I will be immortal if

he has some of my spunk.  I'm

offended.  Right away I smell

freak

.  Writin' about him and me

and

you

finish my

symphony

?  I didn't care

for his drift.  I sent some liquid

soap in a sandwich baggie with a

message from Jesus to mend his

ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And

what's funny is, now I don't mind

bein' inside.  If I was out, even

Born Again, I'd probably get

restless again.  It's maybe better

I stay here, what do you think?

HELEN

I think whatever is best for you,

Daryll.  And maybe you're right,

that's the place.

DARYLL

You come and visit.

HELEN

Where did you send the message to

Peter Kurten?

DARYLL

Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too!

That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to

Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in

return for getting my book to you.

HELEN

How was Conrad supposed to find

Kurten?

DARYLL

Conrad has the phone number.

Conrad, where is he?

HELEN

(from M.J.'s pantomime)

In jail.

DARYLL

That Klutz.  They send him back

here, I'll kick his ass good.

DARYLL LEE

Helen, how is life, you okay?  Come

see me, talk to me.  I think about

you, worry about you all the time.

I am so glad Jesus didn't let me

kill you.  You know -- you're

blessed by Jesus.  That's why you

need to come talk to me, because

Jesus kept you alive for a reason,

and I was his sacred instrument...

In the moment Satan was in my heart

raising my hand to kill you, Jesus

took my hand to spare you.  I am

both death and life to you...

CUT TO:

M.J.

I brought back a gin-seng popper

for you.  Guaranteed all-night

orgasms.

M.J.

Save it for Helen.

RUBEN

(enough already!)

Wait a minute, wait a goddamn

minute...

RUBEN

The woman was in shock.  She was

totally out on ranks.  I stayed

because I didn't want her to wake

up alone in a place where she'd

just been under attack.

(to the Kid who is

restless)

Stop that, you son of a bitch!

(back to her)

The place wasn't secure.  I was

doing my goddamn job!  And, for the

second time

, I slept in her living

room.

M.J.

Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't

have the face for it.  I need you

to help interrogate the burglar in

Hudson's place...

RUBEN

Talk to Nikko...!

NIKKO

You speak English?

(Chinese)

You need an interpreter?

QUINN

I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted

just the bastards dumping them in

the harbor.  What's keeping those

bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in

here...

M.J.

I gotta have Ruben, and a...

NIKKO

Outta your mind?  Look at this...

M.J.

(to Quinn)

Lieutenant...?

M.J.

The prowler in Hudson's apartment

turns out to have a meeting with a

suspect...

QUINN

(amazed)

You got a suspect...

QUINN

How'd you get in on the deal?

M.J.

I'm gonna drop charges on the

break-and-enter at Hudson's...

QUINN

You have no authority to make a

deal like that.  That' s for the

D.A...

M.J.

Or the F.B.I.?

QUINN

Saks.  If he knew you did that!

They're all asking me, 'what is she

doing,' as it is.

M.J.

Give me Ruben back...

QUINN

Nikko?

NIKKO

We get through this shit, let 'em

all

M.J.

I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll

be in the jail when you wind this

up...

RUBEN

I gotta get something to eat, I

haven't eaten all day.

MAC

Here... I'm finished...

RUBEN

(to Kid)

I'm going to the coffee machine.

Hold the fort.

CUT TO:

CONRAD

Who are you?

M.J.

Inspector Halloran.  Homicide.

You were supposed to contact a

Peter Kurten?

CONRAD

(cagey)

I was?  How you spell that?

M.J.

Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the

length of my arm...

CONRAD

(interrupting)

I never hurt nobody...

M.J.

Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got

felony breaking and entering,

burglary, felonious...

CONRAD

(interrupting)

I never carried a gun!

M.J.

You don't listen very good.  This

break in -- I can call it a felony --

three strikes, and you got about

sixteen strikes already, and you're

in jail for the rest of your life,

no parole.  Or I could see it gets

forgotten.

CONRAD

You get me out first.

M.J.

Doesn't work that way.  You had your

chance, now fuck yourself...

CONRAD

Tell me what you want me to say.

Anything.

M.J.

You were going to make a delivery

to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee

Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone

number.

CONRAD

I don't have it...

CONRAD

Wait... wait... I already called

him, I threw it away.

M.J.

You already made the delivery?

CONRAD

No, that's still in my jacket I was

wearing.  We were supposed to meet

on the docks, that number 47 wharf,

10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand

me 500 bucks.

M.J.

What Friday?

CONRAD

What day is this?  In jail you lose

track.  This week.  Friday.

CONRAD

Don't forget me, please.  I told

you what you wanted -- don't forget

me.

CUT TO:

RUBEN

Behave.  You refuse my hospitality,

I'm putting you to bed.

NIKKO

Take it easy, Kid.  Nobody's gonna

do anything.  Just let the gun

down, so it don't go off...

KID

(screams)

Nobody comes through the door...

M.J.

Hey,

you

...

KID

I'm a juvenile!  I'm a juvenile!

M.J.

Gigi!  Dock 47.  I need a couple

units to drag the area...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

M.J.

Quinn will be here any minute.  What

are you going to say?

NIKKO

Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking

drawer!  You spend twenty years

thinking some perp's gonna whack

you... you'll crash your car... but

what happens is, you fuck

yourself...

(a chocked laugh)

You can't imagine how many times I

saw you two... your head together,

I wish him dead.  Every time...

Want to hear something weird?  I

feel like I'd give my life to bring

him back.

M.J.

You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.

NIKKO

Who gives a fuck?  In all the years

I never seen you cry.

(beat)

You loved him.

M.J.

Who gives a fuck?

QUINN

Nikko.  My office?  M.J., I wanna

see you later.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

QUINN

(nothing her look)

He's on temp leave with pay.  I

talked the Commissioner out of no

pay.

M.J.

You want mine, too?  You take his,

you take mine.  I'm the one fucked

it up...

QUINN

So I'm maybe gonna lose three good

cops?  You fucked up on this

occasion, but don't be so hard on

yourself.  There's something I want

you to think about.  The book says

if you use your gun, use it to

kill, that's what it's meant to do.

You tried to pick this punk off

with fancy shooting, to keep him

alive.  To what end?  You're not

willing to kill, you can't be a

cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.

CUT TO:

ANDY (V.O.)

If yo dialed carefully you've

reached your dream number.  Now,

you know what to do.

HELEN (V.O.)

... their compulsion is less about

sex than it is about control.

Power.  Action.  Release from

passivity.  Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi

and Buono, Berkowitz, Dahmer...

home.  Bundy said he wanted to

master life.  And death...

HELEN

Peter Kurten!

CUT TO:

HELEN

You were right!  He knew me!  He

went to my lectures.  He recorded

them!  Listen to this...

ANSWERING MACHINE

...Action.  Release from passivity.

Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,

Berkowitz, Dahmer... Dahmer killed

his first victim because the boy

just wanted to go home.  Bundy said

he wanted to master life.  And

death...

HELEN

What happened to you?!

M.J.

Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop

thing, a crazy kid and a buncha

dumb mistakes... I'm sorry...

because you and he...

M.J.

I just thought it was so --

unprofessional.  Of you both!

HELEN

He felt sorry for me.  It was so

nice to flirt.  He was a darling

man.

M.J.

A man?  I thought he was a boy.

(bursting out)

This last Christmas was the

happiest Christmas I had in the

last ten years... you know why?  It

was the first Christmas in six

years I was not in love.  Son of a

bitch

married men

!  Who cares about

marriage, the bed just gets crowded

and noisy?!

HELEN

You're exhausted.  Let me get you a

brandy.

M.J.

Where's the john?  Let me clean up

this mess, and get back to work.

HELEN (O.S.)

Who's the married man?

M.J.

What does it matter?  This guy, you

checked your course records, who

signed up?

HELEN

The University computer is down for

maintenance, but I've been going

through my own notes...

M.J.

(her voice is dead)

Look.  There's the order:  you

wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi &

Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's

going to be Dahmer next.  Which

means he'll kill a man.

HELEN

Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...

M.J.

(dialing)

Bundy.  That's the last one in your

speech...

HELEN

Maybe you should...

I'm working on it!  It's what I do.

Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.

Where's Andy, can we get some

coffee in here?

HELEN

(she's going through

records)

Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere.

What does he do?  Nothing.

I am not going to talk about it.

How do you

know

head was gone?  Where is the head?

Are you looking for it?  Oh, God,

why him?  Because of me.  I can't

talk about it.  I write about

things like this, stuff it all in

books and bury it in libraries.

This is the first person close to

me who's ever died.  And it's

because of me.  This monster killed

him because I loved him.

M.J.

I've got to go.  I've

M.J.

How many do you need to sleep.

Really sheep?

HELEN

W-We had a fight.  I called him...

called him a name...

M.J.

Christ, Helen.  The first time,

we're ahead of the son of a bitch!

I can't leave you like this -- and

there's no time.  Knock yourself

out.

HELEN

(beat)

Right.  Well.  He's going to do

Bundy.  Bundy faked injuries, wore

a plaster cast, or walked on

crutches, and asked college girls

for help -- carrying his books,

pushing his car...

M.J. (V.O.)

Like the others -- he'll pick the

most extravagant murder -- Bundy's

three murders in one night at a...

How far out?

M.J.

Hundred mile radius.

M.J.

What are the FBI doing?

DETECTIVE 2

They were combing Fertility

clinics.

M.J.

You want to get onto the DMV, we

want records on all gold or yellow

colored VW bugs, any year.  I want

an in-person check on every

registered owner.  If it's rental --

check rental first -- get names and

location of who is driving one now.

M.J.

Alert Campus Security on college

campuses, all of them.  They should

warn all female students with long

straight dark hair parted exactly

in the middle -- I'm serious! -- to

avoid any strange male contacts and

report any man with an apparent

handicap who tries to get them to

carry groceries or books, or push

his car...

M.J.

(to them)

That was Bundy.  He killed forty of

them, identical, long hair, parted

in the middle, alike as Barbie

dolls.

(breaks off)

...this is hopeless.  Let's try to

get time for a police spokesman to

appear on college radio and TV

hookups and broadcast a warning?

What about auto body and paint

Got him!

SUSAN

I am here with Lieutenant Quinn of

the Homicide Division and (title)

Saks of the FBI.  Can you tell us

what happened here, tonight?

QUINN

Susan, the San Francisco Police

Department, assisted by the FBI,

developed evidence that the serial

killer, referred to as the Copycat

killer was an individual who

resided at this address.  Upon

being asked to step out of the

house to be interviewed, the

suspect set fire to the house

possibly to destroy evidence of his

wife's murder.  We found her dead

of gunshot wounds in an upstairs

bedroom.  He himself died in the

fire.

(to shouted

questions)

No, we'll wait until we've located

any relatives who should be

notified.  Witnesses saw the

individual burn to death, they were

unable to reach him in time to save

him.  We're glad, as the entire

city must be glad, this reign of

terror is ended.  No, no more at

this time.  Thank you...

I heard. Good police work.

Just horseshit luck.

Don't ever forget how good you are.

I love you.

Halloran.

HELEN

I don't believe it.

M.J.

Helen.

(beat)

I saw him die.  I saw him burning on

the basement stairs, he never

reached the top.

HELEN

They never kill themselves.  How do

you know it was him.  You never met

him.  You never even saw a

photograph...

M.J.

Helen -- let go.  You've got to let

go.

HELEN

He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done

every one of the others, hasn't he?

If there are three dead Chi Omega

college girls tomorrow, how will

you feel?  Go there.  See if there

could be any way for him to escape.

M.J.

This has been the worst 48 hours of

my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going

to try to get drunk.

HELEN

If there's a one percent possibil-

ity, can you live with yourself

when he kills again?

Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn

self righteous.

Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter

Foley -- how do you grade me now,

Doctor?

HELEN

(beat)

Who was the man in the basement?

PETER

You like that action?  Didn't that

cop on TV look

solemn

?  The guy in

the basement doesn't matter,

anyway, just another lonely heart.

HELEN

Where are you, Peter?

PETER

You

Bundy next, so you sent your

partner...

PETER

What was that?  What am I hearing?

The sound of an epiphany, a sudden

blinding insight?

HELEN

It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?

PETER

Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You

have to come to me.

HELEN

You know I can't do that.

PETER

Oh, I think you will.

M.J.

(yelling)

Call the police!  Now!  Call Qui...

HELEN

For God's sake Peter, leave her out

of it.  You don't want her, you

want me.

PETER

I need her; she's a cop.  I have to

kill a cop, and then...

HELEN

You've been perfect.  Don't spoil

the symmetry -- you have to have a

male cop.

PETER

I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's

the important thing.  Cop-ness, not

sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but

it'll be good.

M.J.

(yells)

Call Quinn and Saks.

PETER

I'm tired.  I want it to end

tonight, don't you?

HELEN

Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now.

Let her go.  I'll come -- just let

her go.  She's not important.

You know where.

Merry, how... oh, Christ, of

SAKS

Just get out of your vehicle...

HELEN

He's got Sergeant Halloran in

there.  He'll kill her the minute

he sees or hears your people...

You've been very useful, Doctor, we

appreciate all you've done, and now

her.  Let me...

PETER

Listen to them!  We'll be on all

three channels.

HELEN

Kill me, Peter, do it, now.

PETER

No.  Not yet.

HELEN

Do it.  If that's what all this

carnage is about, then do it.  Have

enough guts to do it.

PETER

Don't talk to me about courage.  I

know death, what it's like to kill.

You're not a killer -- you watched

Daryll Lee kill that cop and you

didn't make a peep, because you

were paralyzed with fear.  You

chocked.  I know something

else

you.

PETER

You want one?  No?  There was

something in you that was

fascinated, that wanted to see what

Everybody feels it.  Like every

person who slows to see a bad

accident, or runs to see a fire.

That's true.  I see it in you...

you're the same as me.

PETER

Oh, no.

PETER

We'll keep talking.  Until they get

here.  Then...

(smiles)

HELEN

I have no life anymore.  I ruined

your life, make me pay for it.

PETER

Why did you do that?  Didn't you

have any idea how hard it was for

me, to get that far?  I worshipped

you.  You inspired me.  I thought

you could understand me the way you

understood the others.  I knew that

about you -- the ones you admired

were the great murderers; they

fascinated you.

HELEN

That's not who I admire -- I admire

people who are good at what they

do, great artists, writers,

thinkers...

PETER

I don't have the talent for any of

those things.  All I have a talent

for is death.  And I am one of a

kind.  What do you think of your

student now?  I have made you

famous, I am your creation and your

monument.

HELEN

If you let me, I can make you more

famous than any of them.

PETER

Oh, please.  I know what's coming,

now.  "Let me help you..."

HELEN

Do anything you want to me.  I give

myself to you.  Only put the knife

down.  Isn't this what you always

wanted?  I know it's what we all

want, to love and to loved.  I

could love you.  You could work

together in some safe place, learn

to really understand you, help you,

give you some peace of mind, some

happiness...

PETER

Back in the driver's seat again,

Doctor?  That old dream -- study us

to see what makes us sick.  So you

can find a cure -- they'd name it

after you?  Death is the only cure

for people like me.

HELEN

Do it.  For God's sake,

now

...

PETER

(surprised, like a

child)

You hurt me!

M.J. & HELEN

No!!

CUT TO:

M.J.

Jesus that hurts.  You think the

rib is busted?

PARAMEDIC

That looks like just a bad bruise.

I'll tape it up if you want to...

M.J.

I'll take some Tylenol and codeine,

instead, how about a lot of number

six?

M.J.

(it hurts)

Oh, God.

QUINN

I'll take it, kid.  You take two

weeks paid leave.  Don't waste a

second thinking about that shitbag.

Then come back.  You're a cop, M.J.

QUINN (cont'd)

Get the civilians outta here.

M.J.

She's in no shape to give her

statement tonight...

QUINN

No, she can come in tomorrow...

gonna want to know a lot of

things...

HELEN

The only one who could tell you

what you really need to know is

dead.

QUINN

Yeah, it's a thought...

M.J.

You could use a long hot bath, you

know that?  You better get somebody

to drive you home.

HELEN

Why can't I drive home?  I will.

You.  Look at you.

You

home.  And you don't even know it.

M.J.

(beat)

Well, thanks.

SUSAN

Hey!  Halloran!  What's the story

here?

HELEN

If she has to ask, she's never

gonna know.
