MAYOR (V.O.)

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

the future of Los Angeles!

MAYOR

The Arroyo Seco freeway is just

the beginning.  We're planning

freeways from Downtown to Santa

Monica, from the South Bay to the

San Fernando Valley.  Twenty

minutes to work or play is the

longest you'll have to travel.

REPORTER

How many bodies you think Mickey

Cohen'll be able to hide in all

that cement?

HUDGEONS (V.O.)

Meyer Harris Cohen, Mickey C to

his fans.  He's the big moocher,

local L.A. color to the nth

degree.  You know Mickey.  He runs

dope, rackets and prostitution.

He kills a dozen people a year.

But who you may not know is

bodyguard Johnny Stompanato.

HUDGEONS (V.O.)

Johnny's handsome, ladies, but the

real attraction is below the belt.

Second only to Steve Cochran, he's

sometimes known as 'Oscar' because

of his Academy Award-size

appendage.

HUDGEONS (V.O.)

Remember, dear readers, you heard

it here first, off the record, on

the Q.T. and very

Hush-Hush

MAYOR

We're selling an image, gentlemen.

Beautiful weather.  Affordable

housing.

(re:  model)

Trouble-free transportation.  And

the best police department in the

world to keep it all running

smoothly.

CHASE (V.O.)

My name?  Joe Reno.  The city?

Los Angeles.  A big town.  Full of

all sorts of people.  It's my job

to help them.  I like what I do.

I'm a cop.

MAYOR

But with a second rate Al Capone

out there, L.A. looks like Chicago

in the '30s.  Something has to be

done.

POLICE OFFICER

Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.

COHEN

Bullshit.  What's the charge?

POLICE OFFICER

Non-payment of federal income tax.

COHEN

Bullshit

.

REPORTER

How's your bullshit now, Mickey?!

LOEW

Today is an auspicious one for the

city of Los Angeles.  Mickey Cohen

has just been sentenced to ten

years in federal prison for

failure to pay income tax.

As the District Attorney for Los

Angeles County, it is my pleasure

to declare our great city

organized crime free.  It is truly

the dawning of a new day.

STOMPANATO

Officer White.  I heard you got a

hard-on for wife beaters.

BUD

And you fuck people up for a

living.  That don't make me you.

Capisce

, shitbird?

STENSLAND

Bud ain't in the mood for small

talk, Stompanato.

STOMPANATO

Look, Mickey C's doing time and

half the other guys who'd hire me

are dead or left town.  I need

money.  If your snitch-fund's

green, I'll get you some fucking-A

collars.

STOMPANATO

There's this guy.  He's blond and

fat, about forty.  Likes the

ponies.  Been pimping his wife to

cover his losses.  Knocks her

around to keep her in line.

STOMPANATO

I figure the address is worth

twenty.

STOMPANATO

Yuletide cheer, fellas.

BUD

Happy New Year, greaseball.

STENSLAND

Leave it for later, Bud.  We got

to pick up the rest of the booze

and get back to the precinct.

BUD

Central, this is 4A-31.  Send a

prowler to 1486 Evergreen.  White

male in custody.  Code 623 point

one.  Domestic assault and

battery.  I won't be here, but

they'll see him.

BUD

Touch her again and I'll know

about it.  Understand?  Huh?

BUD

You got someplace you can go?

BUD

Go get yourself fixed up.

WIFE

(nods, determined)

Merry Christmas, huh?

STENSLAND

You and women, partner.  What's

next?  Kids and dogs?

ACTRESS

Brett Chase told me you're the cop

who busted Bob Mitchum.

(grinds closer)

These 'Badge of Honor' guys like

to pretend, but being the real

thing must be a thrill.

JACK

Let's go someplace quiet.  I'll

give you the low-down on Mitchum.

ACTRESS

You got your handcuffs with you?

JACK

Two sets.

ACTRESS

I'll get my coat.

HUDGEONS

Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have

this dance?

JACK

Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from

Hush-Hush

magazine.

ACTRESS

I know who he is.

HUDGEONS

We did a piece last year.

'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her

name got mentioned.

JACK

Is she?

HUDGEONS

Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a

friend of mine just sold some

reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's

tripping the light fantastic with

Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla,

Hollywood Hills.  It's right

around the corner.

JACK

You lost me, Sid.  Who?

HUDGEONS

Contract players at Metro.  You

pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in

the next issue.  Plus the usual

fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking

Santa Claus?

JACK

I need an extra fifty.  Two

patrolmen at twenty apiece and a

dime for the watch commander at

Hollywood Station.

HUDGEONS

Jack!  It's Christmas!

JACK

No.  It's felony possession of

marijuana.

HUDGEONS

They're sitting in the dark,

goofing on the Christmas tree.

JACK

Stand there with your camera.

I'll stop here so you get

Grauman's Chinese in the

backgrouns.

HUDGEONS

I like it!  I like it!

JACK

Police!

HUDGEONS

Cut!  Wrap it!

HUDGEONS

(stantorian tone)

It's Christmas morning in the City

of Angels, and while decent

citizens sleep the sleep of the

righteous, hopheads prowl for

marijuana, not knowing that a man

is coming to stop them.  The free-

wheeling, big-time Big V,

celebrity crime-stopper, Jack

Vincennes, the scourge of

grasshoppers and junk fiends

everywhere.  You like it, Jackie-

Boy?

JACK

Yeah, it's subtle.

HUDGEONS

Remember: you heard it first here,

off the record, on the Q.T. and

very

Hush-Hush

EXLEY

What's on the call sheet?

YOUNG OFFICER

A guy dressed as Santa has been

exposing himself to kids in Los

Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's

decorated himself.

EXLEY

Decorated?

YOUNG OFFICER

With tinsel and plastic icicles

and... on his penis, sir.

EXLEY

I get the idea.  You got a

description?

YOUNG OFFICER

Of his penis, sir?

LYNN

A case each of gin, Scotch, and

rum.  Everything top shelf.  None

of that watered-down stuff you

push on Errol Flynn.

OWNER

(laughs)

Sounds like a helluva party.

OWNER

You want it delivered?

LYNN

Before five tomorrow.

OWNER

I'll be right with you, Lynn.

BUD

Merry Christmas.

LYNN

Merry Christmas yourself,

Officer

.

BUD

That obvious, huh?

LYNN

(smiles sweetly)

It's practically stamped on your

forehead.

MEEKS

Get lost why don't you?

MEEKS

I got a license for that.

MEEKS

Cut me some slack.  I used to be a

cop.

BUD

Turner Meeks?  Never heard of you.

LYNN

(exiting store)

We just call him Buzz.

BUD

You okay?

PATCHETT

She's fine.

BUD

(menacing)

I'm not asking you.

BUD

Somebody hit you?

LYNN

It's not what you think.

BUD

What is it then?

SUSAN

You got the wrong idea, Mister.

I'm fine.

LYNN

(getting in the car)

But it's nice to know you care.

STENSLAND

What's going on?

BUD

You know him?

STENSLAND

Seen him around.  He used to be a

cop.

CUT TO:

L.A. Herald Express

REPORTER and photographer listen

REPORTER

Captain Smith, I --

DUDLEY

Drop the formalities; it's

Christmas Eve.  Call me Dudley.

REPORTER

Dudley, I came up with a title for

the story.  I'm calling it "Silent

Night with the L.A.P.D."

DUDLEY

Excellent.  How's this?

(dramatic pause)

The sanctity of the night is an

invitation to the darker criminal

element.  Our vigilance will not

be diminished.

DUDLEY

That's Smith with an S.

DUDLEY

This way, gentlemen.

YOUNG OFFICER

Two police officers were assaulted

in a bar.  Brown and Helenowski.

DUDLEY

This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of

the legendary Preston Exley.  He's

the watch commander tonight and a

damn fine job.

DUDLEY

I was fortunate enough to be

partnered with his father when I

was a rookie.  It makes a man feel

old.  That's a fact.

(a beat)

Feel free to get a feel for the

place.

DUDLEY

A word with you, lad.

DUDLEY

To the memory of your father.

DUDLEY

The day he got the Medal of Valor.

A simpler time.

EXLEY

To the solving of crimes that

require absolute justice.

DUDLEY

That was his favorite toast.

(a beat)

I saw the test results on the

lieutenant's exam.  You placed

first out of twenty-three.

EXLEY

The youngest applicant by eight

years.

DUDLEY

You'll make lieutenant inside a

year.  Patrol division?

EXLEY

I was thinking Detective Bureau.

DUDLEY

You don't have the eye for human

weakness to be a good detective.

Or the stomach.  You're a

political animal, Edmund.

EXLEY

You're wrong.

DUDLEY

Am I...?  Would you be willing to

plant corroborative evidence on a

suspect you knew was guilty in

order to ensure an indictment?

EXLEY

Dudley, we've been over this.

DUDLEY

Answer yes or no.

EXLEY

I... No.

DUDLEY

Would you be willing to rig crime

scene evidence to support a

prosecuting attorney's working

hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.

EXLEY

No.

DUDLEY

Would you be willing to beat

confessions out of suspects you

knew to be guilty?

EXLEY

No.

DUDLEY

Would you be willing to shoot

hardened criminals in the back to

offset the chance --

EXLEY

No.

DUDLEY

Then for God's sake, don't be a

detective.  Stick to assignments

where you won't have to make those

choices.  Patrol, Internal

Affairs, but not the Bureau.

EXLEY

I know you mean well, Dudley, but

I don't need to do it the way you

did.  Or my father.

DUDLEY

At least get rid of the glasses.

I can't think of one Bureau man

who wears them.

STENSLAND

Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.

BUD

I got to write my report first.

PASSING COP #1

Hear about Helenowski and Brown?

They got into a helluva scrap with

six taco benders at some bar.

Helenowski lost six pints of

blood.  Brown's in a coma.

PASSING COP #2

We ought to teach Paco and his

friends a lesson.

WOMAN (V.O.)

(over phone, like

silk)

Whatever you desire.

JACK

Hi... I'd like to get a delivery

to Beverly Hills.

WOMAN (V.O.)

(over phone)

I don't think I know you.

WOMAN (V.O.)

(over phone)

Whatever you desire.

JACK

Look, a friend of mine gave me

this number.  I just --

OPERATOR (V.O.)

(filtered)

Pacific Coast Bell.

JACK

This is Sgt. Vincennes.

Requesting a name and address on a

phone number.  Hollywood zero-one-

two-three-nine.

OPERATOR (V.O.)

(filtered)

Please hold the line... No such

number is assigned.

JACK

I just called it.

OPERATOR (V.O.)

No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.

JACK

(realizes, hangs up)

A bootleg...

EXLEY

All right, men.  You've had your

fun.  Time to break it up.

STENSLAND

Fucking Exley.  Guy's got a pole

so far up his ass, every time he

farts the flag waves.

EXLEY

What's going on?

COP

They got the spics who japped

Helenowski and Brown.  Helenowski

lost an eye and Brown's got brain

damage.

EXLEY

I have the report right here.

They're home with bruises and

muscle pulls -- Oh shit...

STENSLAND

For ours, Pancho. And you're

getting off easy.

JACK

White, you better get a lease on

Stens before he kills someone.

GARCIA

Fuck you,

pendejo

.

BUD

Yeah yeah...

GARCIA

And fuck your mother too.

EXLEY

(arriving)

Stop, Officer!  That's an order!

EXLEY

You're going in my report!  All of

you!

EXLEY (V.O.)

Let me out!  That's an order!

Herald

Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned

DISSOLVE TO:

CHIEF

Officer White, you've refused to

cooperate with Internal Affairs.

But you should know this is bigger

than a police board.  Indictments

may be handed down.  Quite

frankly, we need police witnesses

to offset the damage done to the

Department's image.  Will you

testify?

BUD

No, sir.  I won't.

CHIEF

District Attorney Loew.

LOEW

Bloody Christmas.  The press love

to label.  You and Officer

Stensland brought the liquor into

the precinct.  Stensland was

already drunk.  Do you see how

appearing as a voluntary witness

against him could offset the

damage you've done to yourself?

BUD

I won't do it.

(staring at mirror)

I won't testify against my partner

or anyone else.

LOEW

This man is a disgrace.

CHIEF

Your badge and gun, Officer.

CHIEF

This is the new L.A.P.D., White.

You're suspended from duty and

dismissed.

CHIEF

Ed, your observations have been

astute.  What's your assessment of

this situation?

EXLEY

The public demands justice, sir.

This was a full-fledged riot of

policemen.  Shift the guilt to men

whose pensions are secured.  Force

them to retire.  But someone has

to swing.  Indict, try and convict

Stensland and Bud White.  Secure

them jail time.  Feed them to the

sharks, sir.  Protect yourself;

protect the department.

DUDLEY

Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight

D fitness reports from every C.O.

he ever served under.  But White

is a valuable officer.

EXLEY

White's a mindless thug.

DUDLEY

No, Edmund.  He's a man who can

answer yes to those questions I

ask you from time to time.

CHIEF

I want to know who we give the

public in contrast?  The

department needs role models.

Clean-cut,

forthright

men the

public can admire.

EXLEY

I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid

to do what's right.

CHIEF

And I'll promote you.  You'll be a

lieutenant immediately.

EXLEY

Detective

lieutenant.

CHIEF

Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't

make lieutenant until he was 33.

EXLEY

I know that, sir.  I also know

that when he made lieutenant, it

was as a detective.

LOEW

(interrupting)

Before we start polishing our

laurels, it would look better if

we had a corroborative witness.

DUDLEY

That'll be hard to come by.  The

men hate a turncoat.

EXLEY

Jack Vincennes.  He's the

technical advisor on 'Badge of

Honor,' sir.  He lives for it.

That's the way to get him.

CHIEF

All right, Ed.

(into desk

intercom)

Call Sergeant Vincennes.

DUDLEY

You'll reap the benefits, but are

you truly prepared to be despised

within the department?

EXLEY

Yes, Dudley.  I am.

DUDLEY

So be it.

DUDLEY

Sergeant, we'll get right to it.

Nine civilian witnesses have

identified you as hitting Ezekiel

Garcia.

LOEW

But my office has a stellar

witness who will tell the grand

jury that you hit back only after

being hit.

JACK

What do I have to do?

LOEW

Testify against the three officers

who have already earned their

pensions.  Our key witness will

testify roundly, but you can plead

ignorance to questions directed at

the other men.

CHIEF

I'll guarantee you a slap on the

wrist.  A brief suspension

followed by a temporary transfer

from Narcotics to Ad Vice.

(a beat)

When you transfer out of Vice,

you'll be back on the show.

JACK

The show, sir?

CHIEF

Badge of Honor, Vincennes.  We

need to tone down your profile for

a bit.

DUDLEY

John, I doubt you've ever drawn a

stupid breath.  Don't start now.

JACK

Okay.  I'll do it.

CHIEF

Dismissed, Vincennes.

CHIEF

So be it.

Detective

Lieutenant.

CHIEF

Ace them at the grand jury

tomorrow, son.  Wear the smart-

looking suit and ace them.  And,

Ed?  Lose the glasses.

JACK

You're the key witness?

EXLEY

That's right.

JACK

I should've known.  What's the

Chief throwing you?

EXLEY

Throwing me

?

JACK

Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?

EXLEY

You're the payoff expert.  I'm

just doing my duty.

JACK

You're playing an angle, college

boy.  You're getting something out

of this so you don't have to

hobnob with the fucking rank and

file cops who'll hate your guts

for snitching.  If they're making

you a detective, watch out.  Some

Bureau guys are gonna burn in this

and you're gonna have to work with

friends of theirs.

EXLEY

What about you?

JACK

I'm snitching three old timers

who'll be fishing in Oregon next

week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And

smart.

CLERK

Edmund J. Exley to chambers.

JACK

Just remember, Bud White'll fuck

you for this if it takes the rest

of his life.  They already

suspended him.  Just pray he cops

a deal and stays on the Department

because that is one civilian you

do not want on your case.

BUD

That an old fashioned you're

drinking?

(as she nods)

My name's Bud.

REDHEAD

Nobody was born with the name Bud.

BUD

They stick you with a name like

Wendell, you look for an alias.

REDHEAD

What do you do, Bud?

BUD

I'm sorta between jobs.  Look,

what do you say we, uh...

DUDLEY

Lad, may I have a word with you?

BUD

This business, Captain?

DUDLEY

Say goodnight to your friend and

join me by those back tables.

BUD

Does that paper say we've been

indicted?  Does it say Exley's a

hero for squealing me and

Stensland off?

DUDLEY

He made his play amd he got what

he wanted.  They're making him a

detective.

BUD

Captain, what do you want?

DUDLEY

Call me Dudley.

BUD

Dudley, what do you want?

DUDLEY

Lad, I admire your refusal to

testify and your loyalty to your

partner.  I admire you as a

policeman, particularly your

adherence to violence as a

necessary adjutant to the job.

And I am most impressed with your

punishment of wife beaters.  Do

you hate them, Wendell?

BUD

(looks away)

Yeah, I hate them.

DUDLEY

And for good reason judging from

what I know of your background.

BUD

What's going to happen to

Stensland?  He'll give himself

cirrhosis over this.

He's one

year from his pension

.

DUDLEY

It would've happened years ago if

you hadn't carried him.  Why the

loyalty, Wendell?

BUD

He helped me out once.  That's all.

DUDLEY

Your partner's through.

Department scapegoat on the

Chief's orders.  He's been billed,

he'll be indicted and he'll swing.

BUD

Him and me both.

Fucking Exley

.

DUDLEY

Don't underestimate his skills.

As a politician he exceeds even

myself.  But the department needs

smart men like Exley and... direct

men like yourself

BUD

What do you want

?

DUDLEY

Wendell, I want you to come to

work for me.

BUD

Doing what?  Mowing your fucking

lawn?

DUDLEY

They're yours.  Take them.

BUD

I knew you had juice, but...

There's no goddamn bill on me?

DUDLEY

Four of the defendants recanted

their testimony.

BUD

How?

DUDLEY

I need you for an assignment the

Chief's given me the go-ahead on.

A duty few men are fit for, but

you were born for.  You'll be

working out of Homicide.

BUD

(excited)

Homicide?  A detective?

CHIEF

Your talents lie elsewhere,

Wendell.  It's a muscle job and

shooting job.  You'll do what I

say and not ask questions.  Do you

follow my drift?

BUD

(disappointed)

In Technicolor.

DUDLEY

Will you work for me?

BUD

Of course... But how?

DUDLEY

How what, Wendell?

BUD

How'd you get them to retract?

outside the Federal Courthouse in the opening

montage.  A CAR SCREECHES up.  TWO GUNS aim and Nate

A groundbreaking.  The Mayor scrapes at the ground

distinguished guests.

END OF MONTAGE

14-YEAR-OLD

Why'd you become a policeman?

CHASE

I'm not a policeman.  I just play

CHASE

To protect and serve.  It's not

just a motto.

CHASE

That one.  In the sweater.

They shot him in his library.

I don't want a floor plan; I want

to know who!  Who's taking the

ticket for this, Johnny?

STOMPANATO

Nobody.  At least not yet.

COHEN

And what about the merchandise

Deuce was holding for me?

STOMPANATO

Gone.  Not a trace.

COHEN

Some ferstunkener is moving in and

we don't know who?!  Maybe we

should ask Hedda Hopper!

VICE CAPTAIN

Picture-book smut, gentlemen.

There's been a bunch of it found

Mostly narcotics and prostitution

Look who's back from suspension.

We're honored, Sergeant Jack.

JACK

Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book

Caper of 1953.

VICE CAPTAIN

Vincennes, is there someplace

you'd rather be?

JACK

Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.

VICE CAPTAIN

Oh?  Anyplace else?

JACK

Working whores with squad two.

VICE CAPTAIN

Maybe you should have thought of

that before you made Bloody

Christmas page one.

VICE CAPTAIN

They're yours.  Make a major case,

Sergeant.  It's the only way

you're getting out of here.

HUDGEONS

Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I

need copy.

JACK

No.  But I've got something going

with Ad Vice.

HUDGEONS

Something good?

JACK

Don't know.  I'm chasing picture

books.  Fuck shots, but the posers

don't look like junkies.  It's

well done stuff.  I thought you

might have heard something.

HUDGEONS

Not a word.

JACK

What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their

slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'

HUDGEONS

No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack,

I'll talk to you later.  Call me

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

Park Rangers report three Negro

youths discharging shotguns into

the air in Griffith Park.

Suspects are driving a late model

purple Mercury Coupe.

EXLEY

(gasping)

You're just a thug, White.  That's

all you'll ever be.

DUDLEY

You should stay away from a man

when his blood is up.

EXLEY

His blood's always up.

DUDLEY

Then maybe you should stay away

from him all the time.

STENSLAND

Don't look so down in the mouth,

Bud.  You nailed him good.

BUD

Yeah, sure... I got a couple of

hours before I have to be at the

Victory.  Want to grab a beer?

STENSLAND

Rain check me, partner.  I got

something big going on tonight.

BUD

What?  That new mystery girl

you've been seeing?

STENSLAND

No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not

now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But

it could take the edge off that

jail time I got coming.

BUD

What are you talking about?

STENSLAND

It's confidential, Bud.  Like that

magazines Vincennes scams for.

Griffith Park from a late-model

purple Mercury Coupe.

DUDLEY

(to his adjutant)

Get on it.

FORENSICS COP

We got an I.D. on one of the

victims, sir... I think it's Dick

Stensland.

DUDLEY

With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los

Angeles is organized crime free.

The Chief wants it to stay that

way, Edmund.  The means are not

for the weak-hearted.

DUDLEY

Come, Wendell, you can do better

than that.

FLATNOSE

I know things.  I hear things.

Like with the Mick inside, things

are on this weird slowdown.

(MORE)

FLATNOSE (CONT'D)

These shooter teams, bang bang

bang, they're 86-ing Mickey

Cohen's men.

DUDLEY

We know all that, lad.  Tell us,

who do these shooters work for?

FLATNOSE

I don't know.  No one knows.

Maybe they're mavericks.  You want

a prostie roust?  Huh?  Some narco

action?

(breaking down)

What do you want?!

DUDLEY

We want you to go home.

(to Breuning)

Uncuff him, Michael.

DUDLEY

Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark

from San Francisco.  He arrived

this afternoon at Union Station.

Looking for business opportunities

in our fair city.  An organized

crime associate in need of re-

education in the ways of polite

society.

FLATNOSE

Motherfuckers!

DUDLEY

It's part of the play, Edmund.  A

sincerity test.

DUDLEY

(to Breuning)

Sit him back down.

DUDLEY

Wendell, you need to accompany

Detective Lieutenant Exley on

official police business.  I'll

finish up here.

BUD

Where are we going?

EXLEY

It's a surprise.  You like

surprises, don't you, White?

CORONER

Call me crazy, but for a second I

thought it was Rita Hayworth.

EXLEY

We need you to I.D. the body.

There's no next of kin and you

knew him best.  So tell me...

EXLEY

Is that Dick Stensland?

BUD

Yeah, that's Stens.

EXLEY

Hell of a way to avoid a prison

sentence.

BUD

What happened?

EXLEY

Someone held up a coffee shop,

panicked and killed six people.

WOMAN (O.S.)

Not my baby!  Not my little girl!

CORONER

Is this your daughter, Mrs.

Lefferts?

MRS. LEFFERTS

I -- I don't know.

EXLEY

We know this is difficult.  Just

take your time and look again.

MRS. LEFFERTS

It seems like my Susan, but...

EXLEY

When was the last time you saw

her, Mrs. Lefferts?

MRS. LEFFERTS

At Christmas.  We had fought.  I

didn't like her boyfriend.  I --

she has a birthmark on her hip.

MRS. LEFFERTS

It's her.  My baby.  Dear God...

L.A. Times

headline.

DUDLEY

'Nite Owl Massacre.'  Hyperbole

aside, this is a heinous crime

that requires a swift resolution.

The public will demand it and this

department will provide it.  Six

victims.  One of them, one of our

own -- Dick Stensland.

(as the cops react)

As it happens, he was a Nite Owl

regular.  In the wrong place at

the wrong time.

DUDLEY

Robbery looks like the motive.  We

have rubber glove prints on the

register and preliminary forensics

strongly lean toward a trio of

gunmen.  We do have one hot lead,

so listen well.  Three Negro

youths were seen last night

discharging shotguns in the air at

Griffith Park.

A park ranger I.D.ed them as

driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury

Coupe, purple in color.  An hour

ago, a canvassing crew found a

news vendor who saw a purple Merc

Coupe parked across from the Nite

Owl around 3:00 A.M.

DUDLEY

The D.M.V. worked all night to get

us a registration list on '48 to

'50 purple Mercs.  There are 142

registered to Negroes in L.A.

County.  Fifty two-man teams will

shake three names apiece.  Hot

suspects you'll bring here.

Interrogation rooms have been set

up.  They'll be run by Lieutenant

Edmund Exley.  Hollywood Squad.

CHIEF

Enough on that.  Gentlemen, just

go out and get them.  Use all

necessary force.  The people of

Los Angeles demand it.

EXLEY

He might as well have put a bounty

on them.

BUD

Can you take them?  I got

I got something I gotta do.

PARTNER

Christ, I don't know.  What if one

of these names...

BUD

What I gotta do is for Stensland.

My partner.

REDNECK

Where to, Trash?

JACK

If we go by the list, we have

about zero chance of making the

collar.  But I know a guy who

knows what's going on south of

Jefferson.  I'm betting he could

put us at 50/50.

REDNECK

I don't know...

EXLEY

I'll take those odds.

(to Redneck)

Take off.  We got it from here.

REDNECK

Between the two of you guys, you

should bring along a photographer.

BUD

I need an address on a customer of

yours.  Her name was Lynn.

OWNER

That's all I have to go on?

BUD

Yeah.  And I think you already

know who I mean, so cough it up.

OWNER

Lynn Bracken.  There's a billing

address and a delivery address.

BUD

Give me both.  Billing first.

BUD (O.S.)

You must slay 'em at the country

club.

BUD

Are you Pierce Patchett?

PATCHETT

I am.  Are you soliciting for

police charities?  The last time,

you people called at my office.

BUD

I'm a homicide detective.  Where

were you last night?

PATCHETT

I was here, hosting a party.  Who

was killed and why do you think I

can help?

BUD

Richard Stensland.

PATCHETT

I don't know him.  Mr...

BUD

Officer White.  How about Susan

Lefferts?  You know her?

PATCHETT

(sighs, concedes)

You know I do or you wouldn't be

here.  How did you find me?

BUD

We met outside Hollywood Liquors

on Christmas Eve.  This is where

Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

PATCHETT

Of course...

BUD

Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.

I'm investigating.

BODYGUARD

Everything alright, Mr. Patchett?

PATCHETT

(waves him off)

Fine, Philip.  Thank you.

BUD

Where's the other guy?  Buzz.

PATCHETT

He no longer works for me.

(a beat)

Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.

I'll give you a handsome reward.

Whatever you desire

.

BUD

Thanks, but no thanks.

PATCHETT

Against your code?

BUD

I don't have one.  Lefferts looked

beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't

act it.  How come?

PATCHETT

Do you care about criminal matters

peripheral to Susan's murder?

BUD

No.

PATCHETT

Then you wouldn't feel obligated

to report them?

BUD

That's right.

PATCHETT

Then listen closely, because I'll

only say this once and if it gets

repeated, I'll deny it.  I run

call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one

of them and so was Susan Lefferts.

I treat my girls very well.  I

have grown daughters, myself, and

I don't like the thought of women

being hurt.  I sense you share

this feeling.

BUD

(ignores comment)

Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

PATCHETT

I think she'd been hit in the face

with a tennis racket.  She is --

was -- a big doubles fan.

BUD

You wanna go downtown and discuss

this officially?

PATCHETT

Wait.  Our deal still holds?

PATCHETT

I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill

out my little studio.

BUD

What little studio?

PATCHETT

There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable,

Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my

Veronica Lake.  I use girls who

look like movie stars.  Sometimes

I employ a plastic surgeon.

BUD

That's why her mother couldn't

I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.

PATCHETT

No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse

Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on

your best behavior, but that's all

I'll give you.  If you persist,

I'll meet you with my attorney.

Now, would you like Miss Bracken's

address?  I doubt she knows

anything, but --

BUD

I got her address.

PATCHETT

Of course... this is personal with

you, isn't it, Mr. White?

This Gun For Hire

with Alan Ladd and Veronica

LYNN

Hello?

OLDER GENTLEMAN

(Alan Ladd)

Is it the cops?

JACK

Leonard Bidwell?

JACK

How's the left these days?

BOXER

What's it to you?

JACK

I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I

like your style.

BOXER

What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

JACK

You got a brother up in Folsom.  I

know because I put him there.

BOXER

Till 19-fucking-70.

JACK

How'd you like to make it 1960?  I

know the judge and Sergeant Exley

here is friends with hte D.A.

JACK

We're looking for three colored

guys who like to pop off shotguns.

One of 'em owns a purple Merc

coupe.

BOXER

You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch

jacket?

JACK

You wanna buy your brother ten

years...?  You don't have to say

anything.  Just look at this list

and point.  Here.

BOXER

He's bad, so I'll just tell you.

Sugar Ray Coates.  Drives a '49

coupe, a beautiful ride.  Don't

know about shotguns, but he gets

his thrills killing dogs.  He is

righteous trash.

JACK

That's five minutes from here.

OLDER GENTLEMAN

I don't understand, doll, we just

got started.

LYNN

I'm sorry, but I'll make it up

to you.  I promise.

OLDER GENTLEMAN

Gosh, kitten, I don't know...

BUD (O.S.)

Hit the road, gramps.

OLDER GENTLEMAN

Alright.  This time I'll go, but

next time --

BUD

(flips badge)

L.A.P.D., shitbird.  Get the fuck

out of here or I'll call your wife

to come get you.

LYNN

I've been expecting you.  Pierce

called.  Told me what happened

to Sue.

LYNN

It's Officer White, isn't it?

LYNN

Can I get you a drink?

BUD

Yeah, plain scotch.

LYNN

I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,

but we weren't really friends.

You know what I mean?

BUD

Are you sorry she's dead?

LYNN

Of course I am.  What kind of

question is that?

BUD

Have you ever heard of Dick

Stensland?

LYNN

No I haven't.  Do you know why

Pierce is humoring you?

BUD

You use words like that, you

might make me mad.

LYNN

Yes.  But do you know?

BUD

Yeah I know.  Patchett's running

whores and judging by his address,

probably something bigger on the

side.  He doesn't want any

attention.

LYNN

That's right.  Our motives are

selfish, so we're cooperating.

BUD

Why was Susan Lefferts at the

Nite Owl?

LYNN

I don't know.  I never heard of

the Nite Owl till today.

BUD

Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?

LYNN

Like I said we were friendly,

not friends.

BUD

How'd she meet Patchett?

LYNN

Pierce meets people.  Sue came

on the bus with dreams of

Hollywood.  This is how they

turned out.  Thanks to Pierce,

we still get to act a little.

BUD

Tell me about Patchett.

LYNN

He's waiting for you to mention

mention.

BUD

You want some advice, Miss

Bracken?

LYNN

It's Lynn.

BUD

Miss Bracken, don't ever try to

fucking bribe me or threaten me

or I'll have you and Patchett

in shit up to your ears.

LYNN

I remember you from Christmas

Eve.  You have a thing for

helping women, don't you,

Officer White?

BUD

Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

LYNN

You say 'fuck' a lot.

BUD

You fuck for money.

LYNN

There's blood on your shirt.  Is

that an integral part of your job?

BUD

Yeah.

LYNN

Do you enjoy it?

BUD

When they deserve it.

LYNN

Did they deserve it today?

BUD

I'm not sure.

LYNN

But you did it anyway.

BUD

Yeah, just like the half dozen

guys you screwed today.

LYNN

(laughs again)

Actually, it was two.  You're

different, Officer White.  You're

the first man in five years who

didn't tell me I look like

Veronica Lake inside of a minute.

BUD

You look better than Veronica

Lake.  Now,

Pierce Patchett

.

LYNN

He takes a cut of our earnings

and invests it for us.  He makes

us quit the life at thirty.  He

doesn't let us use narcotics and

he doesn't abuse us.  Can your

policeman's mentality grasp

those contradictions?

BUD

He had you cut to look like

Veronica Lake?

LYNN

No.  I'm really a brunette, but

the rest is me.  And that's all

the news that's fit to print.

LYNN

It was nice meeting you, Officer.

BUD

Look.  I want to see you again.

LYNN

Are you asking me for a date or

an appointment?

BUD

(suddenly unsure)

I don't know.

LYNN

(another smile)

If it's a date I think you'd

better tell me your first name

because I --

BUD

(feeling foolish)

Forget I asked.  It was a

mistake.

EXLEY

L.A.P.D.

JACK

Shit

.  Someone beat us here.

JACK

Hey.

CARLISLE

What the fuck are you guys doing

here?

EXLEY

Think of us as back-up.

JACK

What do you got?

BREUNING

Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box

of double-ought buck and cash.

JACK

So long, Vice.  Badge of Honor,

here I come.

CARLISLE

Fuck you, Vincennes.  It's our

collar.

EXLEY

Quiet.  I'm ranking officer here.

We go as a team.  End of story.

EXLEY

Damnit...

JACK

What?

EXLEY

Glasses.

JACK

(chuckling)

Just don't shoot me.

JACK

Freeze!

CARLISLE

Ace him, Jack.

EXLEY

Shut up, Carlisle!

EXLEY

Casitas Youth Camp... Coates

twenty-two, a boxer... Manager

saw them burning clothes.

DUDLEY

Ed, I want confessions.

EXLEY

I'll break them, sir.

JACK

You think golden boy can handle

it, Cap?

DUDLEY

I think you'll be surprised what

Edmund's capable of.

EXLEY

They call you Sugar Ray because

of Ray Robinson?

(no answer)

They say Robinson can throw a

four punch combination in one

second.  Do you believe that?

EXLEY

You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?

COATES

Say what and so what.

EXLEY

Did one of the officers work you

over a little?

EXLEY

You look like Robinson after

that last LaMotta fight.  'Course

LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So

you're twenty-two, right?

COATES

Man, why do you keep asking me

that?

EXLEY

Just getting my facts straight.

Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber

bounce.

You should have pulled this caper

a couple of years ago.  Get life,

do a little Youth Authority jolt,

transfer to Folsom a big man.

Orbit on some of that good prison

brew, get yourself a sissy --

COATES

I never truck with no sissies!

EXLEY

That fucking Larry.  I almost

believed him.

COATES

Believed what?

EXLEY

Nothing, Ray.

(laughs)

That Larry, he's a pisser.  You

did the Casitas Youth Camp with

him, didn't you?

COATES

Man, why're you talkin' about

Larry?  His business is his

business.

EXLEY

Sugar, Larry told me you went

sissy up at Casitas.  You

couldn't do the time so you

found yourself a big white boy

to look after you.  He said

they call you 'Sugar' because

you gave it out so sweet.

COATES (V.O.)

Larry gave it at Casitas!  Man,

I was the fuckin' boss jocker on

my dorm!  Larry's the sissy!

Larry gave it for candy bars!

EXLEY

Ray, you protected Ty and Larry

up in Casitas, didn't you?

COATES

You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid

down home niggers got no more

sense than a fuckin' dog.

EXLEY

I heard you like to shoot dogs.

COATES

Dogs got no reason to live.

EXLEY

Oh?  you feel that way about

people, too?

COATES

Man, what're you saying?

EXLEY

Ray, we got the shotguns.

COATES

I don't own no shotguns.

EXLEY

Why were you throwing clothes

in the building incinerator?

COATES

(trembling)

Say what?

EXLEY

You guys were arrested this

morning, but none of you have

last night's clothes.

You

were

seen burning them.  Add to that

the fact that you hid the car

you were cruising around in

last night and it doesn't look

good.

COATES

I got nothin' more to say till

I see a judge.

EXLEY

Were you on hop?  You were passed

out when you got arrested.  Were

you hopped up, Ray?

COATES

Ty and Larry fuck with that

shit, not me.

EXLEY

Where do they get their stuff?

Come on.  Give me one to feed

the D.A.  Just a little one.

COATES

Roland Navarette.  Lives on

Bunker Hill.  He runs a hole-up

for parole absconders and sells

red devils.

EXLEY

I'm going to take a break.

EXLEY

You know, Ray, I'm talking about

the gas chamber and you haven't

even asked me what this is all

about.  You got a big guilty

sign around your neck.

DUDLEY

Masterful, Edmund.  Your father

would've been proud.

(pointing)

This one's on the verge.

EXLEY

Fontaine next, but give Jones

the newspaper.  I want him

primed.

EXLEY

Larry, Ray Coates ratted you

off.  He said the Nite Owl was

your idea.  You want to tell me

about it?

EXLEY

I think it was Ray's idea.  Talk

and I think I can save your life.

EXLEY

Larry, this is a gas chamber job.

If you don't talk, you'll be dead

in six months.

EXLEY

Son, six people are dead and

somebody has to pay.  It can be

you or it can be Ray.

EXLEY

Larry, he called you queer.  He

said at Casitas you took it up

the ass.  He said --

FONTAINE

I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY!

EXLEY

Why'd you burn the clothes?

FONTAINE

(sobbing)

I just wanted to lose my cherry.

I didn't mean to hurt her.

EXLEY

Hurt who?  Was she a hooker?

Hurt who?

DUDLEY

Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with

the Nite Owl.

EXLEY

She may still be alive, whoever

she is.

JONES

This newspaper shit ain't shit.

EXLEY

Where's the girl?  Did you kill her?

EXLEY

You wanted Larry to lose his

cherry, but things got out of

hand.  Is that right?

EXLEY

(over speaker)

Kick loose, Jones.  I know you

made her bleed, but that doesn't

mean you killed her.

EXLEY

(over speaker)

If that girl's alive, you've

still got a chance on this one.

JONES

(over speaker)

I think she's alive.

EXLEY

(over speaker)

You

think

?

JACK

He's good.  I'll give him that.

EXLEY

Where is she now?

(no answer)

Did you leave her someplace?

(no answer)

Did you sell her out?  Give her

to some of your buddies?  Tell

me where the girl is!

BUD

One in six.  Where's the girl?

EXLEY

Officer White, put down that

weapon and --

BUD

WHERE

?!

JONES

S-sylvester F-fitch one-o-nine

and Avalon gray corner house...

BUD

Give me one minute.

DUDLEY

You've got it, Wendell.

DUDLEY

We're going through the front.

BUD

Get her to the fucking hospital.

EXLEY

A naked guy with a gun?  You

expect anyone to believe that?

BUD

Get the fuck away from me.

EXLEY

How's it going to look on your

report?

BUD

It'll look like justice.  That's

what that fat fuck got.

Justice

.

EXLEY

You don't know what the word means,

you dumb bastard.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

Repeat, three suspects escaped

from the Hall of Justice jail.

The Nite Owl killers:  Raymond

Coates, Tyrone Jones and Larry

Fontaine.  They are considered

armed and extremely dangerous.

Descriptions are as follows...

EXLEY

'Give me one to feed the D.A....

Roland Navarette.  Lives on

Bunker Hill.  Runs a hole-up for

parole absconders.'

EXLEY

Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

CARLISLE

Is something up, Lieutenant?

No glasses

.  He

EXLEY

Nobody move!

DISSOLVE TO:

CHIEF

We mourn the passing of a good

man.  The loss of Sgt. William

Carlisle is the loss of his

wife, his family and the entire

Los Angeles Police Department...

EXLEY

I need the girl to give me a

chronology of events.  No details.

Just times.

NURSE

Absolutely not.  She barely

remembers her own name.

EXLEY

But --

NURSE

I was told the case was closed.

Should I call your superior to

double-check?

EXLEY

No.  that won't be necessary.

OLDER GENTLEMAN

You tell Mr. Patchett I have no

intention of changing my vote.

OLDER GENTLEMAN

It may surprise some, but a mature

man, enlightened by the facts, can

change him mind...

CHIEF

Edmund J. Exley has amassed a

brilliant record in his seven

years with the L.A.P.D.  Recently

he evinced spectacular bravery in

the line of duty.  It is my honor

to present him with our highest

honor, the Medal of Valor.

DUDLEY

Your father would've been proud.

EXLEY

There are loose ends out there,

Dudley.  I --

DUDLEY

There always are.  But there are

also three men and three guns.

Matched forensically.  A few loose

ends don't matter.

EXLEY

Something's wrong.  I feel it

inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?

DUDLEY

Breaking a big case sticks you in

a whirlwind.  A little self-doubt?

It's natural.  Just keep it

inside.  Between you and you.

CHASE

This election is about the future

of law enforcement in Los Angeles.

Ellis Loew represents that future.

So dig deep and let's get a moral

man re-elected.

HUDGEON (O.S.)

Big V Jack Vincennes!

HUDGEONS

You're back, boychick.

JACK

Sid, how are they hanging?

HUDGEONS

Down around my ankles.

HUDGEONS

You remember Matt Reynolds?

HUDGEONS

The Grauman's Chinese pot bust.

He just got off the honor farm.

JACK

What's he doing here, Sid?

HUDGEONS

You tight with the D.A., trash?

JACK

Sure, he just tried to throw me

off the force last Christmas as a

little joke.

HUDGEONS

How'd you like a little payback?

Not to mention a donation to the

widows and orphans fund.  Did you

know Loew was a swish?

JACK

And Reynolds?

HUDGEONS

He's queer too.  Metro paid him

two grand a week to fake it with

ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm

getting him to fuck the D.A. for a

hundred bucks.

(winks)

That's twice the fifty you got for

wrecking his career.

HUDGEONS

Matt!  Over here!

HUDGEONS

That's D.A. Loew right there.

HUDGEONS

You need a drink, kid... Jack,

look after him a minute.  Kid,

this is Jack.  No secrets between

me and him.

REYNOLDS

Have we met before?

JACK

Yeah.

REYNOLDS

Was it a party?

JACK

Something like that.

REYNOLDS

(misreading)

Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party,

right?

JACK

Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you

desire.'

REYNOLDS

Dope, liquor, hookers that look

like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett

has it all.

JACK

Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way

back.

REYNOLDS

Pierce isn't like regular people.

I dig him, but he scares me too.

JACK

Really?  How?

REYNOLDS

(shakes his head)

You know, when I came out to L.A.,

this isn't exactly where I saw

myself ending up.

JACK

Yeah.  Me neither.

HUDGEONS

Dutch courage, kid.  Drink up.

REYNOLDS

I don't know if I should do this.

HUDGEONS

Hey, it's not like you don't know

how.  And Jack here has

connections on 'Badge of Honor.'

Pull this off and there'll be a

part for you.  I smell a comeback.

Don't you, Jack?

JACK

Loew's free.  Congratulate him.

HUDGEONS

If Reynolds works his charms,

which he will, this is the address

where they'll be.  Meet me at

midnight.  I guarantee all sorts

of illegal activity.

JACK

Sid, why would a guy like Pierce

Patchett get involved with running

dope and hookers?

HUDGEONS

Where'd you hear that?

JACK

Around.

HUDGEONS

Jackie, all I know is what you

know.  The man is very rich.  And

he's invested in freeway

construction so he's gonna get a

lot richer.  But that's it.

Patchett's what I like to call

'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he

ain't Red, he can't help me in my

quest for prime sinuendo.

HUDGEONS

What

?

REYNOLDS

I can't do it.

HUDGEONS

Talk to him, Jack.  Tell him about

the opening on the show.

JACK

I'm pretty sure I can get you a

part on the show... But tonight?

Pretend it's an acting job, kid.

Showbiz.

REYNOLDS

And no one'll know about this?

JACK

It'll be our secret.

REYNOLDS

Showbiz.

DUDLEY

Where did you intend to start.

Prostitution?  Gambling?

(no answer)

Go back to Cleveland, lad.  This

is the City of Angels and you

haven't got any wings.

LYNN

(opening door)

Did you forget some --

LYNN

I wondered when you might ring the

bell again, Officer White.

BUD

It's Bud.

LYNN

You should see yourself.  You look

like you're ten years old.

LYNN

If you'd called first, I wouldn't

look this ridiculous.

LYNN

You're wondering if Patchett told

me to be receptive.

LYNN

It doesn't matter.  I like you,

Bud.  I really do.

JACK

Come on, Sid.  Where are you?

JACK

It's Vincennes!  Open up!

HUDGEONS

Jackie!  You got some good scoop

for the Sidster?

JACK

Sid, cut the crap.  I --

HUDGEONS

Give me some Narco skinny.  I want

to put out an all hop-head issue.

Shvartze jazz musicians and movie

stars.  Maybe tie it into the

Rosenbergs.  You like?

JACK

Shut up!

HUDGEONS

(confused)

What's wrong, Trash?

HUDGEONS

What happened with the kid and

Loew?

HUDGEONS

You didn't get my message?  It got

called off.  The kid chickened out

at the last minute.

JACK

He's dead.  I was just there.

Somebody slit his throat.

HUDGEONS

Jesus.  Jack, that's a story.

'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.'

Let me get my camera.

JACK

Loew didn't go with him.  You're

sure?

HUDGEONS

I put Reynolds in the cab myself.

The night cost me a hundred scoots

and I got bupkis.

HUDGEONS

Jackie!  Big V!  Let me get my

camera!  Where are you going?!

BARTENDER

What'll it be, Jack?

JACK

(pulls out wallet)

A bottle of Scotch.

BARTENDER

Hey!  Your change!

BUD

Who was that guy who was here

earlier?

LYNN

It doesn't matter.  All they get

is Veronica Lake.  You got the

real Lynn Margaret Bracken...

(re: scar)

Where'd this come from?

BUD

When I was ten, my old man threw a

bottle at my mother.  I guess I

got in the way.

LYNN

So you saved her.

BUD

Yeah.  But not for long.

LYNN

Do you like being a cop, Bud?

BUD

I used to.  What I do now is

strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff...

No, I don't like it.  If I could

work Homicide like a real

detective...

BUD

There's something wrong with the

Nite Owl.  That prick Exley shot

the wrong guys.  But they made him

a hero and whoever killed my

partner is still out there.

BUD

In here I know it.  But I can't

prove it.  I'm not a detective.

I'm not smart enough.  I'm just

the guy they bring in to scare the

other guy shitless.

LYNN

You found Patchett.  You found me.

You're smart enough.  Be a

detective if that's what you want.

BUD

That simple, huh?

CLERK

I got the rap sheets on the black

guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got

charges a mile long.  But except

for some kid stuff, Fontaine's

clean.

EXLEY

Clean?

CLERK

More or less.

EXLEY

Until he gunned down six people.

PARK RANGER

I asked my men, Lieutenant.  No

one remembers any colored guys

firing shotguns.

EXLEY

Then who phoned in the report?

PARK RANGER

Not us.

PINKER

Bud White, what brings you down to

the basement?

BUD

I got a few Nite Owl questions.

PINKER

I don't know if you read the

papers, but that case is closed.

BUD

I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding

my report.  You know how it goes.

PINKER

What do you want to know?

BUD

Anything off.  Anything that

didn't make sense.

PINKER

You mean beside the fact that

thirty-five out of forty-five

rounds were gratuitous?  I can't

think of anything.

BUD

Whose shoe?

PINKER

Susan Lefferts.

BUD

(pointing)

If she was sitting here, then it's

facing the wrong way.  What are

these smears in the blood?

PINKER

It looks like she was flailing,

trying to get away.

BUD

But she's moving away from the

door.

(thinks; points)

Who was sitting at this table?

PINKER

Dick Stensland.

(a beat)

Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew

him she would've been sitting with

him... Right?

PINKER

You know, there is one thing.

PINKER

Cotton balls.  I found them just

inside the meat locker door.

BUD

Ear plugs

.

PINKER

Exactly.  At least one of those

animals had the brains to protect

his ears.

BUD

It doesn't exactly play like dumb

panic.

PINKER

What do you mean?

BUD

It's like they knew they were

going to kill everyone before they

went in...

PINKER

Yeah, so...

BUD

Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White

with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask

a couple of questions.

MRS. LEFFERTS

Let my daughter rest in peace.

BUD

Five minutes.  That's all.

BUD

Tell me about the boyfriend she

had.  The one you mentioned at the

morgue.

MRS. LEFFERTS

First I want to go on record as

saying that my Susie was a virgin

when she died.

BUD

Ma'am, I'm sure she was.

MRS. LEFFERTS

Susie, I told you I didn't approve

of that boyfriend.  He was too old

for you.  You let him come into

this house and be fresh to me.  I

went out one day and old Mrs.

Jensen next door saw Susan's

boyfriend and another man and

thought she heard a ruckus.

BUD

What was that boyfriend's name?

MRS. LEFFERTS

We were never properly introduced.

Susan and I were fighting that

day.  She called him by a

nickname.  Muns or Lunts or

something.

BUD

Stens?  Was it Stens?

MRS. LEFFERTS

Maybe.  I don't know.

BUD

Look at a picture for me.

MRS. LEFFERTS

That's him.  That's him.

BUD

You said a neighbor heard a

ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?

MRS. LEFFERTS

I don't know.  You'll have to

leave now, Officer.

BUD

What's through here?

MRS. LEFFERTS

No!  Please leave!

MRS. LEFFERTS

Don't mind the smell.  I think a

rat died behind the wall... My

Susie was a good girl!

BUD

Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.

MRS. LEFFERTS

I came home that night and there

was blood on the floor.  Susan

said Stams -- Stens had cut

himself.  They were acting

nervous.  And that Stens kept

going under the house.

BUD

Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.

MRS. LEFFERTS

Was it... a rat?

BUD

Yeah.  A great big one.

BUD

Here.  Compliments of the Los

Angeles Police Department.

PINKER

Hey, just in time for our stomach

of the week.  Frankfurters with

sauerkraut, French fries,

Coca-Cola, alcohol and sperm.

Jesus, what a last supper.

EXLEY

The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering

you about the case?

PINKER

Yeah.  The fact that you guys

won't let it get filed away.

EXLEY

What are you talking about?

PINKER

Bud White grilled me on it this

morning.  You know, he's not as

dumb as I thought.

MRS. LEFFERTS

Let my Susie rest in peace!

EXLEY

Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask

a few questions.

MRS. LEFFERTS

That other policeman already

checked under the house and found

not a thing amiss.

EXLEY

Officer White?

MRS. LEFFERTS

A sweet man.

EXLEY

(thinking

out loud)

Under the house.

MRS. LEFFERTS

All he found were rodents.  No

signs of foul play.  So there.

MRS. LEFFERTS

My daughter was a virgin!

EXLEY (O.S.)

I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.

EXLEY

I need an I.D. ASAP.  You talk

only to me on this one.

JACK

Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes

requesting.  I need the home

address on a Pierce Patchett.

OPERATOR (V.O.)

Please hold, Sergeant...

EXLEY

I need to speak to you.

JACK

Give me a minute, will ya?

JACK

Damnit...

What

?

EXLEY

I want you to follow Bud White.

JACK

Even I'm not that crazy.

EXLEY

It's not a request.  I need to

know what White knows.  Follow him

or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge

of Honor.'  Permanently.

JACK

Yesterday that might've meant

something.  Pull me off.  You'd be

doing me a big favor.

EXLEY

Yesterday yes, today no.  What

happened last night?

JACK

Transfer me, suspend me.  Just

leave me alone.

EXLEY

You make a mistake?

JACK

Yeah.  My whole life.

EXLEY

Listen, I think I made a mistake,

too.

JACK

I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I

can't hear your confession.

EXLEY

Do you make the three Negroes for

the Nite Owl killings?

JACK

What?

EXLEY

It's a simple question.

JACK

You should be the last person who

wants to dig any deeper into the

Nite Owl,

Lieutenant

.

EXLEY

Rollo Tomasi.

JACK

Is there more to that, or do I

have to guess?

EXLEY

Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My

father ran into him off duty.  He

shot my father six times and got

away clean.  No one even knew who

he was.  I made the name up to

give him some personality.

JACK

So what's the point?

EXLEY

Rollo's the reason I became a cop.

I wanted to catch the guys who

thought they could get away with

it.  It was supposed to be about

truth and justice and Rollo.  But

somewhere along the way I forgot

all that... How about you, Jack?

Why'd you become a cop?

JACK

I don't remember...

JACK

I'm trying to figure what angle

you're playing

this

time, but I

sure as hell can't see one.

EXLEY

I've given up angles for awhile.

I just want to solve this thing.

JACK

The Nite Owl was solved,

Lieutenant.

EXLEY

I want to do it right.

JACK

Okay, college boy, I'll help you.

But I want half the collar.

EXLEY

A third.  I don't think we can

make a case without Bud White.

STOMPANATO

Wendell White, how's tricks,

paesano

?

BUD

I ain't your

paesano

, you wop

cocksucker.

STOMPANATO

What do you want,

officer

?

BUD

You remember an ex-cop named Buzz

Meeks?  He works for a guy named

Patchett.

STOMPANATO

Should I?

BUD

His file listed you as a known

associate.  Now spill.

STOMPANATO

Oh, yeah.  That was a long time

ago.  Before your day.  The last

few years he's been muscle for

hire.  But I heard he's

disappeared.

BUD

More.

STOMPANATO

More's gonna cost you.

BUD

How 'bout I give you your balls

back?

STOMPANATO

(in considerable

pain)

Before Meeks disappeared he was

popping off about trying to move

eighteen pounds of heroin.

BUD

Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit

ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?

STOMPANATO

Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's

narcotics lieutenant.  The night

he got clipped, eighteen pounds of

Mickey's heroin went missing.

STOMPANATO

Meeks is probably in Rio or

someplace like that by now.

BUD

He's under a tract house in San

Berdoo.  And he don't smell too

good.  What happened to the

heroin, Johnny?

STOMPANATO

I don't know.  I swear it!

JACK

He's in the Brown Derby with

Johnny Stompanato.

(sees Bud exit)

Check that.  I gotta go.

EXLEY

What's that for?

JACK

Bud White.  He sees us and we're

dead.

JACK

Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb

after all.

EXLEY

Rita Hayworth at the morgue and

now Veronica Lake with White.

What the hell's going on?

JACK

Movie star hookers.  Whatever you

desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.

EXLEY

What's Fleur-de-Lis?

JACK

High line whores.  With plastic

surgery to look like movie stars.

And who knows what else?  It's run

by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You

want to talk to him?

EXLEY

Yeah.  But first I want to brace

Stompanato.

EXLEY

Check the bar.  I got the restaurant.

STOMPANATO

Hey, you want an autograph, write

to M-G-M.

EXLEY

Since when do two-bit hoods and

hookers give out autographs?

STOMPANATO

What

?

EXLEY

L.A.P.D.  Sit down.

"LANA"

Who in the hell do you think you

are?

EXLEY

Take a walk, honey, before I haul

your ass downtown.

"LANA"

Who in the hell do you think

are

?!

STOMPANATO

You are making a large mistake.

"LANA"

Get away from our table!

EXLEY

(grabs her wrist)

Shut up.  Being cut to look like

Lana Turner doesn't mean you are

Lana Turner.

JACK

She is Lana Turner.

EXLEY

What?

JACK

She

is

Lana Turner.

EXLEY

How was I supposed to know?

PATCHETT

I believe the Nite Owl's your area

of expertise, Mr. Exley.  I saw

you on television getting your

medal.

(turns to Jack)

And you're that other celebrity

Hollywood policeman, aren't you?

PATCHETT

I'll tell you what I told Officer

White when he asked me about

Susan's death.

EXLEY

(a look to Jack)

Bud White's been here?

PATCHETT

For the last time.  I may suborn

women into illicit activities, but

they're handsomely compensated, I

treat them well and make sure the

men they deal with show them every

due respect.

EXLEY

Is the Veronica Lake look-alike

one of your whores?

PATCHETT

A vulgar term, but yes.

EXLEY

What's her name?

PATCHETT

Lynn Bracken.

EXLEY

Why's she seeing Bud White?

PATCHETT

Why do men and women usually see

each other?

EXLEY

Anything else you want to add

before I talk to her?

PATCHETT

No.

EXLEY

Not good enough.

PATCHETT

(unfazed)

Then try talking to my lawyer.

Good evening, gentlemen.

JACK

Guy's as cool as they come.

EXLEY

This is Exley.

DISPATCHER (V.O.)

Ray Pinker wants to talk to you,

Lieutenant.  Says he has your I.D.

EXLEY

Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is

coming in to talk to him.

JACK

What are you going to do?

EXLEY

I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll

meet you at the Dining Car.

JACK

Great.  You get the girl, I get

the coroner.

HUDGEONS (V.O.)

(over phone)

Hush-Hush

.  Off the record and on

the Q.T.

EXLEY

Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant

Exley.

LYNN

I know who you are.  You're the

policeman Bud told me about.

EXLEY

Really?  What did White say?

LYNN

He said you were smart.  He also

said you were competing with your

dead father.  How did he put it?

Trying to measure up to a ghost.

EXLEY

Let's concentrate on my smarts.

Pierce Patchett made you, didn't

he?  He taught you how to dress

and talk and think and I am very

impressed with the results.  But I

need some answers and if I don't

get them, I'm going to take you

and Patchett down.

LYNN

He can take care of himself and

I'm not afraid of you.  And you

forgot one thing, Lieutenant.

Pierce also taught me how to

fuck... Can I get you a drink?

EXLEY

Scotch.

LYNN

I'm curious about you.

EXLEY

Why?

LYNN

Because Bud hates you more than he

loves me.

LYNN

It galls you that I know so much

about you.  You don't have

information to compete.

EXLEY

Don't underestimate me, Miss

Bracken.

LYNN

The way you've underestimated Bud

White?

PINKER

God bless dental records.  Stiff

used to be a cop.  Turner Meeks.

JACK

Buzz

Meeks?

PINKER

You knew him?

JACK

Of him.  He was around when I

first joined the force.  A bad

egg.

JACK

Come on, Exley.  Where are you?

EXLEY

How was I?

LYNN

Oh, the best I ever had.

Absolutely the best.

EXLEY

(laughs)

You sound like you mean it.

LYNN

The silver screen's loss is your

gain.

EXLEY

How about White?

LYNN

You want to know what Bud's like

in bed?

EXLEY

I want to know why you see him.

Is it a Patchett payoff?

LYNN

I see Bud because I want to.  I

see Bud because he can't hide the

warmth he has inside him.

EXLEY

I'll take your word for it.

LYNN

I see Bud because he makes me feel

like Lynn Bracken and not some

Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks

for money.  I see him because he

doesn't know how to disguise who

he is.  There's more if you want

to hear it.

LYNN

Does all that make it harder for

you to hate him or easier?

EXLEY

I don't hate White.  I really

don't.  It's just, in my business,

it's the wild cars you have to

watch out for.

LYNN

You don't like that you don't know

how to play him.  He doesn't

follow the same rules of politics

you do.  That makes him dangerous.

EXLEY

You cut to the heart of things,

don't you?  What about Lynn

Bracken?  She going to be a hooker

all her life?

LYNN

I came out here with a dream.

That's gone, but I settled for

reality.

EXLEY

Some reality.

LYNN

No.  This is the means to the

reality.  But I'm not going to

tell you what it is.

EXLEY

Why not?

LYNN

Because you'll use it against me.

Won't you?

LYNN

You're tougher than Bud thinks you

are.

EXLEY

(smiles)

You're the first person to ever

call me tough.

LYNN

Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty

tough, myself.

EXLEY

You, me and White, huh?

LYNN

Actually, Bud's only tough on the

outside.

DUDLEY

John Vincennes.  It's three A.M.,

lad.

JACK

Two minutes, Dudley.  It's

important.

DUDLEY

Lucky for you that my wife and

four fair daughters are at the

beach in Santa Barbara.

JACK

You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?

DUDLEY

A disgrace as a policeman.

Straight D fitness reports from

every C.O. he ever served under.

What about him?

JACK

Twelve years ago he worked a vice

roust with Dick Stensland.  They

arrested a Pierce Patchett on an

extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers.

He'd have them photographed with

their johns, then double-dip for

some blackmail.  Charges got

dropped.  Insufficient evidence.

You were supervising officer on

the case and I was wondering if

you remember anything about it.

DUDLEY

What's this all about, lad?

JACK

Part of it has to do with a

murder.  I've been working with Ed

Exley on it.

DUDLEY

You're Narco, lad, not Homicide.

And since when do you work with

Edmund?

JACK

It's a private investigation.  I

fucked something up and I want to

make amends.

DUDLEY

(smiles, then...)

Don't start trying to do the right

thing, John.  You haven't had

enough practice.

DUDLEY

Have you discussed this with

anyone else, John?

JACK

No.

DUDLEY

Not even with Exley?

JACK

Have you a valediction, lad?

JACK

Rollo Tomasi...

DUDLEY

Sergeant Vincennes' body was found

in Echo Park at ten o'clock this

morning.  Killed by a single .38

round to the heart.  One of our

own, gentlemen.  We cannot

tolerate it.  Justice must be

swift and merciless.  That's all.

DUDLEY

Edmund, a word with you.  We

received a tip this morning.  Did

Vincennes ever mention the name

Rollo Tomasi?

EXLEY

No... Where'd the tip come from?

DUDLEY

Anonymous.  Probably nothing.

DUDLEY

You're perplexing to me these

days, Wendell.  You're not your

old, cruel self anymore.  I need

proof that the extracurricular

work I had planned for you remains

within your grasp.

BUD

What work?

DUDLEY

I've long been involved in

containing hard crime in such a

way that myself and a few

colleagues might someday enjoy a

profit dispensation.  That day

will soon be here and you'll share

handsomely.  Grand means will be

in our hands, Wendell.

(MORE)

DUDLEY (CONT'D)

Imagine crime limited to the

criminal element who perpetrate

it. Imagine the means to keep the

nigger filth sedated.  But don't

stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine

the police in control.  It's big,

lad.

BUD

You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know

what you're talking about.

DUDLEY

You have your extracurricular

secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold

a clarification session soon.  For

now, I need your fearsome old

habits at the Victory Motel.

We're going to brace a man who may

know who killed Jack Vincennes.

Can I count on you?

BUD

Sure, boss.  Sure you can.

EXLEY

I want to know what you and Jack

Vincennes talked about last night.

Anything and everything.  Start

with the I.D. on the corpse.

PINKER

An ex-cop.  Buzz Meeks.  I pulled

his police academy photo.

EXLEY

We got a dead ex-cop and a girl

who looks like Rita Hayworth at

the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop

under the house of Rita's mother.

It's not a good week for ex-cops.

PINKER

I got Vincennes in the next room.

It's not a good week for cops in

general.

DUDLEY

This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.

HUDGEONS

I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't

need to tie me down.

DUDLEY

It's for your own safety.  Now

what can you tell us about

Sergeant John Vincennes?

HUDGEONS

Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can

tell you he's on the Night Train

to the big adios.

HUDGEONS

Take it easy!  I didn't have

anything to do with him getting

killed if that's what you mean.

DUDLEY

But you were business associates?

HUDGEONS

What does that have to do --

HUDGEONS

Okay so we worked together.  It

was an information exchange.  I

got him first class collars and he

got me good stories.  We were

friends for Chrissakes!

DUDLEY

Alright.  We'll drop that line for

now.  Next topic.  Please comment

on Pierce Patchett.

HUDGEONS

You think he had something to do

with Vincennes getting iced?

DUDLEY

Wendell.  I want full and docile

cooperation on all topics.

HUDGEONS

Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows

Patchett's worth a boat-load of

greenbacks.  From aviation,

freeway construction.  But the man

has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B

movies under the table and runs

movie star look-alike hookers.

And try this on:  he's rumored to

be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All

in all a powerful behind-the-

scenes strange-o.

DUDLEY

And?

HUDGEONS

And what?

DUDLEY

Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the

key to all relationships.

HUDGEONS

He runs call girls.  Primo tail.

Fixed up like movie stars.

DUDLEY

And?

HUDGEONS

In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The

trunk under the carpet.  Patchett

got me to photograph a cop fucking

this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks

just like Veronicaaa --

DUDLEY

Wendell!

HUDGEONS

Get him away from me!

DUDLEY

I wouldn't trade places with

Edmund Exley right now for all the

tea in China.

HUDGEONS

Dudley, I thought you were gonna

let the dumb bastard kill me.

(to Breuning)

And you!  Learn to pull those

punches a little better.

HUDGEONS

You can uncuff me now, fellas.

HUDGEONS

Fellas?

(nervous)

We had a deal.  You, me and

Patchett,  We're a team!

(scared)

Come on, we're friends.  We're --

DUDLEY

Hush-hush...

EXLEY

Anything?

CLERK

Nothing.

EXLEY

So on active duty, Meeks didn't

make an arrest from 1938 to '43.

CLERK

Someone must've pulled the

records.

EXLEY

Where are the police academy

files?

CLERK

I don't have time.  I have --

EXLEY

Just show me where they are!

BUD

Did you talk to Exley?

LYNN

Come in out of the rain.  In the

morning we'll have both our

stories for breakfast.

BUD

I want to know about Exley.

LYNN

He's the opposite of you.  He's

more like me.  Cold, calculating.

BUD

How'd you get to know so much

about him?

LYNN

Come in out of the rain, Bud.

BUD

You gonna tell me what happened

with you and Exley?

LYNN

We talked.

BUD

So tell me about it.

LYNN

(looking away)

In the morning.

BUD

No.  Now.

(a beat)

You fucked him.

LYNN

I thought I was helping you.  I

thought --

EXLEY

Why?

BUD

Lynn.

EXLEY

She told you?

EXLEY

Who told you?  Did Dudley have

anything to do with you finding

out?

EXLEY

Listen to me.  Dudley killed Jack.

It has something to do with Buzz

Meeks.

EXLEY

Look.  Dudley and Meeks go way

back.  Stensland, too.

EXLEY

Think, goddamn you.  Think...

BUD

I knew Stensland and Meeks knew

each other.  Meeks was with Sue

Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The

night I met Lynn.  Lefferts'

mother I.D.ed Stensland as

Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens

pretended he didn't know either

one of them.

EXLEY

Stensland and Meeks.  What were

they up to?

BUD

Johnny Stompanato told me when

Meeks disappeared, he was trying

to move the 18 pounds of heroin

that went missing when Deuce

Perkins was shot.

EXLEY

Stensland and Buzz Meeks

.  Two-man

triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen

lieutenants.  When they killed

Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as

a bonus.

BUD

Then something goes wrong.  Meeks

gets killed.  Maybe Stens got

greedy, killed Meeks and left him

under his girlfriend's house.

(a beat)

The night he died, Stens was all

mysterious.  Said he had something

big going down.

EXLEY

The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going

there to sell the heroin.

BUD

Somebody got wind of it, killed

them all.

EXLEY

It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith

Park report was a phony. And, who

says the purple Merc was spotted

outside the Nite Owl?

BUD

Dudley.

EXLEY

The first guys to the car when

Jack and I got there were Bruening

and Carlisle.

BUD

Dudley's guys.

EXLEY

They didn't find the shotguns.

They planted them.

BUD

It all keeps coming back to

Dudley.

EXLEY

It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.

EXLEY

Pierce Patchett figures in, too.

That's the angle Jack was working.

Dudley must work for Patchett.

BUD

Let's just kill them.

EXLEY

What?

BUD

For Jack, for Stensland, for

anybody else who got in the way.

I've been trying to be smart.  A

detective.  But killing those two

fuckers, that would be justice.

EXLEY

Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case.

We play by the rules.

BUD

There are no rules!  Why the fuck

are you doing this?  The Nite Owl

made you.  You want to tear all

that down.

EXLEY

With a wrecking ball.  You want to

help me swing it?

EXLEY

Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run

a good-cop-bad-cop.

BUD

Which one are you and which one am

I?

EXLEY

You expecting problems?

BUD

Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop

muscle.

BUD

Come on.

EXLEY

(a screaming

whisper)

What?

EXLEY

I don't think his ex-cop did him

much good.

EXLEY

It's a suicide note.  Says he

killed Jack because Jack had

figured out a pornography scam

Patchett was running.

BUD

He had help getting up there.  Two

of his fingers are broken.

EXLEY

We had one thing figured wrong.  I

don't think Dudley workd for

Patchett.

BUD

At least not anymore.

EXLEY

Patchett's dead.  He sent you

after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying

up his loose ends.

BUD

(it hits him)

Lynn

.

EXLEY

I got a guy who owes me in the

Sheriff's department.  West

Hollywood station.  He can be at

her house in two minutes.

BUD

Call him.

EXLEY

Is she inside?

DEPUTY

We took her to Hollywood Station

for safekeeping.  Someone worked

her over pretty good.  She

wouldn't say who.

EXLEY

Hold her as Joan Smith.  No one

sees her unless I okay it.

DEPUTY

You got it, Exley.  And now we're

even.

EXLEY

Ellis Loew.

BUD

What about him?

EXLEY

Jack thought he was up to his neck

in all this.

SECRETARY

You can't go in there!

SECRETARY

Do you want me to call the police,

Mr. Loew?

EXLEY

Ask for Captain Dudley Smith.

We'll have a party.  Hot dogs and

sauerkraut.

LOEW

It's okay.  These are police.

(as she leaves)

What

do you want?

EXLEY

I want D.A. bureau men to tail

Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a

day; I want you to get a judge to

authorize a wire tap on his home

phone; I want authorization to

check his bank records and I want

it all in an hour.

LOEW

On what evidence?

EXLEY

None.  Call it a hunch.

LOEW

(incredulous)

Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a

highly decorated member of this

city's police department and I

won't smear his name without --

EXLEY

Without what, his smearing yours

first?  What's he got on you,

Loew?  Pictures of you and an out

of work actor with your pants

down?

LOEW

Do you have any proof?

EXLEY

The proof had his throat slit.

(a beat)

So far you're not denying it.

LOEW

I'm not going to dignify youwith

answers.  If you'll excuse me,

I've got a Jack Vincennes press

conference to prepare for.

LOEW

Unless you're here to wipe my ass,

I think we're through.

LOEW

Don't try this good cop/bad cop

with me.  I practically

invented it.  And so what if some

homo actor is dead.  Boys, girls,

ten of them step off the bus to

L.A. every day.

BUD

Dudley Smith.  Spill.

LOEW

Call him off, Exley!

EXLEY

I don't know how.

EXLEY

Bud...

BUD

If I let you go, there'll be ten

more lawyers to take your place

tomorrow.  They just won't come on

the bus, that's all.

LOEW

Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got

photos of me and Reynolds.

EXLEY

What's Dudley's scheme?

LOEW

Dudley's rotten to the core.  He's

taking over Mickey Cohen's

rackets, his own hand-picked

cops'll be the new franchise

holders.  Because of those

pictures I won't be able to

prosecute.  Oh Jesus pull me up!

LOEW

Dudley's got everyone under his

thumb.  Not just me, but the Chief

of Police, the lieutenant

governor, everybody!

EXLEY

Not everybody

.  You tip-off Dudley

and Officer White visits you alone

next time.

BUD

They never made a match on the

shotgun serial numbers.  What if

Breuning and Carlisle took them

from the evidence room?  Couple of

cold pieces that had been hanging

around a year or two.

EXLEY

We should check the records, and,

we should talk to Lynn.

EXLEY

You want to talk to her?

BUD

You do it.  I'll check the files.

LYNN

(dry)

If I knew you were coming I'd have

baked a cake.

EXLEY

Forget everything else for a

second, Lynn.  Is there anything

you can give me on Dudley Smith?

EXLEY

A police captain.  I think he's

behind all of this.

LYNN

(shakes her head)

I work for Patchett.  I had a

feeling that there was someone

else, but I never knew who.

EXLEY

Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud

hates himself for what he did.

LYNN

(a beat)

I know how he feels.

EXLEY

I don't know if it's pathetic or

romantic, but when this is all

over I'd like to see you again.

RECORDER

I got your guns, Bud.  Signed in

April 3rd, 1950.  Remember the

First Western bank robbery?  They

were used in that.

BUD

I want to see them.

RECORDER

No can do.  I can't find them.

ROOKIE-TYPE

Uh -- Sergeant White?

BUD

What

?

ROOKIE-TYPE

Dispatch just got a call for you.

Lieutenant Exley wants you to meet

him at the Victory Motel.

BUD

You wanted to meet here?

EXLEY

Me?  You called it.  I got a

message that...

EXLEY

Shit... Come on.

BUD

Too late.

BUD

Here.

EXLEY

You figured this was a set-up?

And you showed up anyway?

BUD

A lot of bad stuff happened here.

It's as good a place as any for it

to end.

EXLEY

You know, all I ever wanted was to

measure up to my father.

BUD

(softly)

I spent years trying not to live

down to mine.

(MORE)

BUD (CONT'D)

(thinking)

We should block off the bathroom.

They could come through --

EXLEY

We got him!

EXLEY

I'm thinking we might walk away

from this.

DUDLEY

I'm loathe to kill my brother

officers, Edmund.

EXLEY

Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To

Stensland.

DUDLEY

Jack was a shame, but Dick

Stensland had the audacity to try

to sell me my own heroin.  Through

his whore girl friend.  I sent him

to make the buy.  The rest is

history.

EXLEY

Why?

DUDLEY

A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we

have in Los Angeles.  Sending

Mickey Cohen up created it.  My

containment work maintained it.

Certain photographs guarantee it.

Organized crime has been held

back, but there's still a demand

for the services it provides.

EXLEY

And now you'll provide them.

DUDLEY

Absolutely.  Prostitution and

gambling are victimless crimes.

The heroin we'll run down to the

coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As

long as it's not a middle class

problem, no one will care.  It's

still a crime free city... for

respectable people.

DUDLEY

This isn't politics, Edmund.

There won't be winners and losers

when it's over...

DUDLEY

Just the living and the dead.

It's always been that way in the

Bureau.  You should've realized

that before you became a

detective.

DUDLEY

We're policemen!

(winks)

Let me do the talking.  They'll

make you Chief of Detectives.

EXLEY

No

.

DUDLEY

Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?

EXLEY

Something like that.

DUDLEY

Really

?  Would you be willing to

rig crime scene evidence to

support a prosecuting attorney's

working hypothesis?

DUDLEY

Would you be willing to beat

confessions out of suspects you

knew to be guilty?

DUDLEY

Are you willing to shoot hardened

criminals in the back to offset

the chance they'll --

DISSOLVE TO:

INTERNAL AFFAIRS #1

You have a lot of explaining to

do, Lieutenant.

EXLEY

Yes.  I do.

Hush-Hush

is delivered.  The headline:  "Actor Reynolds

EXLEY

That's it.  That's the whole

story.

LOEW

The press would have a field day

with this.

CHIEF

(a beat)

When in doubt, feed them a hero.

In this case, we'll need more than

one.

CUT TO:

LOS ANGELES EXAMINER

HEADLINE:

R.I.P. DUDLEY SMITH

Fabled L.A. Cop Dies Defending City

from Organized Crime!

CHIEF

Captain Edmund Exley.  Chief of

Detectives.  Los Angeles Police

Department.

EXLEY

(ironic smile)

I tried to throw it all away and

they give it back in spades.

EXLEY

Where will you go?

LYNN

Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good

for pensioners and I know where

everything is.

EXLEY

When?

LYNN

Right now, before I back down.

EXLEY

Where is he?

EXLEY

Thanks for the push.

EXLEY

You just did what you did.  No

rank, no glory.

EXLEY

From me to you.  It'll mean

something if it's yours.

LYNN

We should go now.

EXLEY

Do you think I ever could've been

in the running?

LYNN

Some men get the world.  Others

get ex-hookers and a trip to

Arizona.

FADE TO BLACK.
