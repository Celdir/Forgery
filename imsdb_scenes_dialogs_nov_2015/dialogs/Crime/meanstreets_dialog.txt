Ah, get born, keep warm

Short pants, romance, learn to dance

Get dressed, get blessed

Try to be a success

Please her, please him, buy gifts

Don't steal, don't lift

Twenty years of schoolin'

And they put you on the day shift

MICHAEL

Naw...that ain't shit...that's a

German lens.

MICHAEL

A good buy...good two shipments of

them.

MAN

Can't use it...

MICHAEL

Why...? That's a telescopic one...

it's good.

MAN

First, it ain't German...it's

Japanese...and second, this ain't

no lens...it's like a...a...an

adaptor...so you got two shipments

of Jap adaptors with no lenses.

(HE LAUGHS)

MICHAEL

(DISAPPOINTED)

A Jap adaptor?

CHARLIE

(CONFESSION)

A...As you know, I've just come out

of Confession. And as a penance

they gave me ten 'Hail Marys' and

ten 'Our Fathers'...

CHARLIE

(CONTINUED)

...Now, between you and me... You

know how I feel about such things...

'Hail Marys'...'Our Fathers'...No

imagination...

CHARLIE

(CONTINUING)

...If I'm going to do penance at

all, I'll do it the way I think it

would be done...by me, that

is...according to my own trespasses.

You know what I mean.

CHARLIE

Oh great...hey - Winstons?

MICHAEL

For these prices don't be particular.

That's all they had - but next week

CHARLIE

OK, ok...

MICHAEL

Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.

CHARLIE

No...I'll be ok for a week.

MICHAEL

You seen Johnny Boy tonight?

CHARLIE

(DISINTERESTED)

Nope...

MICHAEL

Isn't he supposed to be here

tonight...I mean...

CHARLIE

Look...I don't know. What am I

supposed to be, his keeper or

something? Yeah, he's supposed to

be here but who knows what goes on

in his head. Right?

MICHAEL

I'd like to know Charlie, it looks

like your little friend is trying

to duck me...

MICHAEL

(CONTINUING)

...Charlie, don't you think you

should be interested in Johnny's

payments to me? I think you should

be, you know that.

CHARLIE

(QUIETLY)

Michael, nobody's out to screw you,

I guarrantee that.

MICHAEL

I know that Charlie but look at my

side. You undersigned the loans.

You vouched for him. What happens

if this kid don't pay me? I gotta

collect from you? I don't want to

do that. I made a deal with him

not you, right?

CHARLIE

(PATRONIZING)

You're right. You're right. Look,

I'm not gonna wind up paying his

debts. You know that.

9.

MICHAEL

I don't know that. That's what I'm

telling you.

CHARLIE

Michael, believe me. You know the

kid's a little crazy sometimes. I

vouched for him and he'll come

through. I promise. I'll talk to

him and straighten him out. Don't

worry, OK?

MICHAEL

(SATISFIED)

OK.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE

What do you think? 'If a man have

a hundred sheep, and one of them

stray, will he not leave the

ninety-nine in the mountains, and

go in search of the one that has

strayed? And if he happen to find

it, amen I say to you, he rejoices

over it more than over the ninety-

nine that did not go astray. Even

so, it is not the will of your

Father in Heaven that a single one

of these little ones should

perish.'... Ok that's very nce but...

JOHNNY BOY

Drinks for everybody Tony...

CHARLIE

(INTERRUPTING)

Giovanino! Where have you been?

JOHNNY BOY

(CONTINUING)

and a double for you and Charlie

here.

(quietly to TONY)

And put it on my tab, willya?

TONY

Which one, the big tab or the

little tab?

JOHNNY BOY

Put it on the little tab so that it

balances with the big one.

TONY

(SARCASTICALLY)

Yeah, so things'll be even.

MICHAEL

How about me? I don't get a drink

John?

JOHNNY BOY

(FEIGNING SURPRISE)

Of course! A double for Michael,

Tony.

JOHNNY BOY

(CONTINUING)

I know what you're going to say but

don't say it. These drinks are all

on the tab. I'm gonna see you this

Tuesday payday, I promise. I give

you my word.

MICHAEL

You what?

CHARLIE

CHARLIE

BOY'S FACE)

What happened to you Flash?

JOHNNY BOY

Charlie, I swear on my mother,

JOHNNY BOY

JOHNNY BOY

Hey... you got stereo.

SAL

Yeah, I think so.

JOHNNY BOY

You got a speaker back there?

JOHNNY BOY

Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab

JOHNNY BOY

SAL

No...no. Nooo...it's just that

JOHNNY BOY

Yeah, it's your father's.

JOHNNY BOY

You mean it's heisted.

SAL

You could say that.

JOHNNY BOY

(announcing it loudly)

This is a heisted car!

13.

END FLASHBACK

CUT TO:

JOHNNY BOY

It's the truth, I swear.

CHARLIE

All right, forget it. Tony, you

got anything we can put on his face?

TONY

Yeah, in the back.

TONY

(CONTINUING)

C'mon, I got something to show you

anyway.

14.

GIRL

(WHISPERING)

Jimmy, I tell you there's something

in this room.

JIMMY

(MURMURS)

Ahhh come on baby...willya'...cut

it out.

TONY

Excuse us Jimmy, we'll only be a

moment.

TONY

S'alright Tony.

GIRL

I told you there was something in

this room.

TONY

Keep quiet about this. I don't

have any license for him yet. I've

only had him a couple of days.

Nobody can feed him except me. I'm

the only one he trusts. Watch.

CHARLIE

Don't go to any trouble. We

believe you... We believe you.

15.

TONY

(ENTERING CAGE)

Really wanted to get a little tiger

Charlie, y'know...a little William

Blake and all that...

CHARLIE

Be careful.

CHARLIE

I'm surprised at you Tone. I mean

you've had the place for over a

year now. Nothing different...same

old place...ordinary...flat...no

imagination.

CHARLIE

(CONTINUES)

For instance, the difference

between me and you is this...you

take that panther back there. I'd

put him right up here above the

bar...nice cage, you know? Nothing

ordinary in my place. What good is

it? You get robot customers. They

come in, drink beer, go to the

bathroom, and go home. No sir.

16.

CHARLIE

See what I mean?

(PAUSE)

A question please...'Is this what

you call living?'

TONY

(WEARILY)

'Take a little tip from Mack the

Knife...'

JOHNNY BOY

(INTERRUPTS)

Tony, break down and open another

bottle willya'?

GEORGE

We're closed.

BOY

I'm just waiting for Joey.

DRUNK

(MUTTERS)

I...I gotta go to the bathroom.

CHARLIE

Well, go ahead, whaddaya want?

Someone to hold it for you?

CHARLIE

(continuing previous conversation)

This place is dead. If I had a

place...every night...lively.

17.

CHARLIE

(CONTINUING)

And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE

or CHARLIE'S PLACE...

(MORE CONFIDENTIALLY)

I'd call it something like SEASON

OF THE WITCH... get it?

TONY

(QUIETLY)

You are with out a doubt the

biggest, most pretentious bullshit

thrower I know. Like to see what

kind of business you'd do.

CHARLIE

Look who's talking. Pretentious

bullshit. Who's the guy with

William Blake and the tigers, eh?

JOHNNY BOY

Will you guys shut up with the

witches and tigers. Tony, you

gonna close the place, we get out

of here, get something to eat, or

what?

TONY

We'll close up as soon as everybody

leaves.

CHARLIE

Don't forget what's-his-name there

in the bathroom.

JIMMY

Wanna see your picture?

JIMMY

Waddaya think?

CHARLIE

Not quite...but keep trying.

CHARLIE

Let's have a game after we close.

18.

JOHNNY BOY

Nah.

CHARLIE

C'mon Tony, waddaya say?

TONY

No.

CHARLIE

(ADDRESSING THE

ENTIRE BAR)

Anybody wanna have a game?

19.

TONY

Don't run...don't run. Everyone

split up.

CHARLIE

Michael, give us a lift.

MICHAEL

OK, get in.

BENTON

Michael...wait.

MICHAEL

Get in, get in.

CHARLIE

Oh Jesus Christ...what's this.

BENTON

Sammy get control of yourself.

20.

JOHNNY BOY

Yes, you're gettin' it all over my

tie.

CHARLIE

Should I slap him?

SAMMY

(suddenly in control)

You wouldn't dare.

BENTON

I'm terribly sorry guys...It's just

that he was terribly frightened.

MICHAEL

Just keep him quiet.

JOHNNY BOY

Friends of yours Michael.

MICHAEL

Shut up.

BENTON

(sensing the hostility)

Oh...ah...I'm Benton and this is

Sammy.

CHARLIE

I can't get over the way he just

kept going at him.

JOHNNY BOY

Must have been all the liquor in him.

MICHAEL

(IN ITALIAN)

Quiet please.

MICHAEL

Where should I drop you Charlie?

SAMMY

(interrupting the conversation)

Yes Charlie, your place or mine.

BENTON

Sammy.

CHARLIE

Away from the neighborhood.

21.

SAMMY

Oh Benton...look!

SAMMY

(CONTINUING)

Hi beautiful!!! I love you.

MICHAEL

Hey, shut up.

CHARLIE

Get him in.

JOHNNY BOY

What...are you kidding.

BENTON

Sammy, get in here this minute.

SAMMY

I won't...I won't! They're all

beautiful.

(SHOUTING)

I'll suck them all...I'll suck them

all!

CHARLIE

Disgraceful.

MICHAEL

Ok...that's it.

MICHAEL

Out!!!!

CHARLIE

C'mon Johnny.

MICHAEL

You getting out too?

CHARLIE

Yeah, thanks, it's ok.

22.

SAMMY

(SHOUTING)

Going our way?

CHARLIE

(to JOHNNY BOY)

Don't answer.

JOHNNY BOY

I don't think I should go home

looking like this. You think I

could stay at your place tonight?

Your mother's not there is she?

CHARLIE

No, she isn't.

CUT TO:

FLASHBACK

23.

CHARLIE

Listen, I'll be ok...it's the best

thing. You're not going to be able

to take care of Grandma out here

and still get to work, you know

that...

(PAUSE)

Yes the place will be here, I'll

take care of it.

(PAUSE)

Yeah don't worry about me, I'll

take care of myself.

(PAUSE)

CHARLIE

(CONTINUED)

No...no parties.

(PAUSE)

I'll eat.

(PAUSE)

Mom, look, just don't worry...ok?

END FLASHBACK

CHARLIE

You'd better make a move kid. He

thinks you're trying to screw him.

JOHNNY BOY

Wouldn't bother me.

CHARLIE

Yeah, big man...get yourself in

more trouble. You make a fool out

of him, you're doing the same to me.

I signed for you don't forget.

JOHNNY BOY

Don't worry. I can handle it.

24.

CHARLIE

You couldn't handle shit. You just

better come through with some kind

of payment on Tuesday...anything.

Understand? Hold onto your pay-

check this week.

JOHNNY BOY

(LAUGHS)

There won't be any this week.

CHARLIE

What do you mean?

JOHNNY BOY

Didn't show up.

CHARLIE

You sick or what? You forget what

we had to do to get you on the

trucks, stupid?

JOHNNY BOY

I don't like loading crates.

CHARLIE

You're not supposed to like it.

What gets me is your attitude.

Listen... tomorrow you show up.

JOHNNY BOY

What about your attitude...Where's

your job...eh? You talk and talk

and I go to work...what do you do?

CHARLIE

I'll tell you what I don't do... I

don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus

interest, stupid. Show up or I

break both your arms, we understand

each other?

JOHNNY BOY

Ok, ok...take it easy. I'll show.

Tuesday I'll give Michael something.

I promise.

CHARLIE

Don't promise...just deliver.

JOHNNY BOY

Ok, now that that's over with...what

are you gonna make me for breakfast?

25.

CHARLIE

I won't wait until Tuesday. I'll

break your arms right now.

JOHNNY BOY

(rising from bed)

Listen...I'm a guest here.

JOHNNY BOY

OK...ok...I'm going.

JOHNNY BOY

Hey...you got nothing here.

CHARLIE

(from the other room)

I could have told you that.

JOHNNY BOY

We'll get some food from my aunt's.

I'll get in through the fire escape.

She's always got something.

CHARLIE

Don't do that. You'll scare Teresa

if you try to sneak in.

JOHNNY BOY

Yeah...you're right. Maybe she'll

have a seizure and we can watch.

CHARLIE

That's not funny. You gonna be a

jerk-off all your life. Grow up.

You want something to eat from your

aunt's house you go knock on her

door, understand?

26.

JOHNNY BOY

I'm not hungry anymore. I'm going

to bed.

JOHNNY BOY

(pretending to be angry)

Hello...fifth precinct? Yeah...I

want to report a disturbance. Yeah

this man and woman next door are

disturbing the peace. They're

keeping me awake all night now.

What the hell is this. What?

Well... yelling, fighting, throwing

things. Uh-huh. If they don't

kill each other soon I'm goin' over

there and do the job myself. Yes -

the address is 270 Mott street. I

think it's apartment 2-r. Yeah,

right... thanks. Look, I demand

immediate action. Never mind my

name I don't like getting involved

in things like this.

27.

CUT TO:

TERESA

I'd like to eat something before I

go back to work.

CHARLIE

Ok, we'll go for lunch.

TERESA

Do you have enough?

CHARLIE

Well...with the hotel that's ten...

fifteen...

TERESA

Here.

TERESA

Please take it.

CHARLIE

Well...

TERESA

I don't mind.

28.

CHARLIE

Sure...it's not that...I mean...

TERESA

(touching his face)

It's all right.

CHARLIE

Well, if things go the way I hope

they'll go, this money business

will take care of itself.

(ASIDE)

God willing.

TERESA

An apartment uptown? Downtown?

CHARLIE

Maybe, who knows.

TERESA

(SEARCHINGLY)

Charlie...?

CHARLIE

Nobody knows anything, believe me.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

See if you can get your hands on

some pamphlets on laws or by

laws...or proprietorship...you

know...at your place.

TERESA

Anything specific?

CHARLIE

You know...like restaurants, night

clubs...

TERESA

(AFFECTIONATELY)

What is it now?

CHARLIE

Don't ask.

29.

TERESA

Alright... Hey, did you hear any

more about what happened last night?

CHARLIE

Did you?

TERESA

No.

CHARLIE

CHRIST, you should have seen it.

Unbelievable. The kid would turn

around and fire and he would just

keep coming at him like Rasputin.

That kid was scared. Not half as

much as we were though.

TERESA

It doesn't make any sense. He

wouldn't shoot him just because he

insulted a racket guy...not unless

it was personal.

CHARLIE

You missed the point. The kid's a

climber...not very bright...but if

you get down to his level to look

at it his way; he kills a guy who

insulted a big man - he gets a

reputation. He thinks he's in good

standing.

TERESA

It's still sick.

CHARLIE

Not sick...just stupid. Speaking

of stupid, your cousin last night

was feeling so good he decided to

break into your mother's house...to

get some food.

TERESA

You're sure he doesn't know.

CHARLIE

Don't worry.

30.

CHARLIE

(CONFESSION)

Don't look at me like that, I can

see this is not going to get us

anywhere. She's a good kid, what

am I supposed to do. In a way I'm

doing her a favor...no??? How many

guys you know feel this way about

an epileptic? Don't get me wrong,

I'm no saint...not yet.

CHARLIE

(CONTINUING)

But I'm not like the Pharisee who

said "Oh God I thank thee that I am

not like the rest of them."...no...I

like to think of myself as the

Publican...

CHARLIE

...'Oh God be merciful to me the

sinner!' I'm not taking advantage

of her. I swear to you that if she

meets someone she'd like to marry...

CHARLIE

(CONTINUED)

...I'll cut out. "If Thy eye is an

occasion of sin to thee...

CUT TO:

31.

CHARLIE

...pluck it out and cast it from

thee." "Woe to the man through whom

scandal does come." I'm sure you'd

agree this is no time to get tied

down. Like the priesthood...

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

...they don't get tied down do they?

"Have I not a right to do what I

chose? Even so the last shall be

first and the...

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

...first last. For many are called

but few are chosen."

OSCAR

(with a slight Jewish accent)

Hey...you're here. They told me

you're here...and you're here. How

are you?

CHARLIE

Ok, how's everything going?

32.

OSCAR

Don't ask...do you have any idea

what I've been doing all

morning...eh?

CHARLIE

No.

OSCAR

I was in the basement fixing the

pipes. Would you believe that?

CHARLIE

(LAUGHING)

What pipes?

OSCAR

(MIMICKING)

What pipes...the ones from last

year...those pipes.

OSCAR

Look Charlie, you're a good boy.

Will you just tell your uncle that

I have nothing. There is nothing

to give him. No envelopes with

cash inside, no checks, nothing.

CHARLIE

That bad, huh?

OSCAR

I can't make this week's payment

and if this keeps up not next

week's either.

CHARLIE

Not next week's either...listen...you

tell that to Giovanni, not me.

OSCAR

Listen, I should wrap up this place

in a ribbon and hand it to him, you

know that. I don't need this

aggravation. I'm getting old.

CHARLIE

He'd rather have the loan payed,

you know that.

33.

OSCAR

Your Uncle's a good man...I won't

stick him. Either he gets the

money or the place and right now

he's getting the place. And tell

me why should I care? I got a

partner who's a bum, who doesn't

help out...who disappears and

leaves me with all the problems. I

should go back to Florida...I don't

need this.

CHARLIE

I don't understand, where's Groppi?

OSCAR

I should know? His wife don't even

know. Probably off with one of his

little girls...I don't know. I

tell you, if he don't give a damn,

then I don't give a damn...Why

should I kill myself?

CHARLIE

My uncle figured that this week was

bad...but about next week...I dunno.

Maybe you should speak to him

yourself.

OSCAR

What can I say?

34.

CHARLIE

(to repair man)

Is my uncle back there?

REPAIR MAN

Yeah, but I think he's busy now.

Hey Charlie play 463 today - for

sure.

CHARLIE

Thanks!

OLD MAN

(in Italian with

ENGLISH TITLES)

What I'm telling you is that he did

it for Mario's honor.

MARIO

But you don't understand. I knew

the kid. He was drunk. He made of

fool of himself...not me.

35.

OLD MAN

(in Italian with

ENGLISH TITLES)

Giovanni - an insult to Mario is an

insult to you.

MARIO

There was no insult.

OLD MAN

(in Italian with

ENGLISH TITLES)

The boy only did what was right.

GIOVANNI

Your son only did what was stupid.

We have enough down here without

something like that. And what for?

...Nothing...no reason. Protect

him? Why? I didn't tell him to do

anything for me. He's going to

Miami? Good...keep him in Miami

for six months...a year...a good

long time. After everything's

forgotten then I see what I can do

for him. Right now...keep him away.

CHARLIE

Marie, are there Columbian coffee

beans in this coffee?

MARIE

I dunno.

CHARLIE

Just a second. Let me taste it.

CHARLIE

Yes, I'd say there are some

Columbian coffee beans in this

coffee, but only about 39%.

36.

CHARLIE

You see. You probably don't notice

this Marie, but Colombian coffee

beans are rich coffee beans.

Bursting with that good, deep

coffee flavor. Picked when they

are ripe to the point of perfection.

The beans of course, are protected

by the tall South American Guama

trees.

CHARLIE

Then the bean pickers come down and

pick each bean by hand. Bean by

bean, all heavy with flavor. And

they load them into boxes, one box

at a time, box by box.

CHARLIE

(CONTINUED)

Like, looking at my uncle back

there. One way is the obvious;

...man outside the law. On the

other hand, instead of a breakdown

of order there is a creation of

order and instead of the breakdown

of law, there is the creation of

law...In this society which needs

new law because 'What's a crowbar

compared to a share of stock.

What's the robbing of a bank

compared to the founding of one and

what's the murder of a man to the

gainful employment of that man.'

'Do not think that I have come to

destroy the Law or the Prophets. I

have not come to destroy but to

fulfill.' ...Amen.

37.

CHARLIE

Uncle, how are you feeling?

GIOVANNI

Fine. Did you have a good time

last night?

CHARLIE

(QUIETLY)

About that shooting last night...I

was there and...

GIOVANNI

No you weren't.

CHARLIE

(EMBARRASSED)

You're right uncle. I must have

gotten it confused with something

else.

GIOVANNI

Yes, you did.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

About Oscar...I think he put on

this act...about the restaurant

being in bad shape and all that.

He can't make the payments...I

don't know what to make of it. He

says Groppi's run off with a girl.

I could help if you want.

GIOVANNI

No...his business is bad. But I'll

decide what to do and you...and you

just keep out of anything that

might...might...er draw attention

to you.

38.

CHARLIE

Yes...I understand...I'll be careful.

TERESA

C'mon Charlie...one more day. I'll

call in sick for work.

CHARLIE

No...we can come back in a couple

of weeks. Besides, if we're both

gone for three days it wouldn't

look right.

TERESA

Ok.

CHARLIE

Bore.

TERESA

A paper on that one too?

CHARLIE

Yeah...but don't worry about that

now. The Hemmingway one is first.

TERESA

It was nothing. I'm almost finished.

CHARLIE

Take your time. I don't care.

TERESA

I know you don't. You've been very

preoccupied lately.

CHARLIE

That's the word...preoccupied.

39.

CHARLIE

Let's go back inside.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

See that...know who lives there?

The name George Earhardt mean

anything to you?

TERESA

Sure...He lives there?

CHARLIE

No. Of course he lives there.

Would I point it out to you if he

didn't?

CHARLIE

That W.A.S.P. bastard.

TERESA

You're intolerable today.

CHARLIE

Watch your language.

TERESA

I like it here...alone.

TERESA

I'm going to take that apartment

uptown.

CHARLIE

Uhuh...probably a good idea. Why

don't you do it this time?

40.

TERESA

You know why...with my parents.

CHARLIE

Well you can't blame them in a way.

TERESA

(pulling away from him)

I can take care of myself. You

know that.

CHARLIE

I know...I know.

FLASHBACK

TERESA'S MOTHER

Turridu...that's your boy Charles.

Don't you know him. Isn't that

Charles?

TERESA'S MOTHER

(CONTINUED)

Who is that?

CHARLIE'S FATHER

Che Guevara.

41.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE

...He must have heard the name from

those T.V.'s in the hall that were

blaring all the time. I remember

GUEVARA was in town at the time.

Must've heard it from there I

guess...but that's funny, isn't it?

TERESA

Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.

CHARLIE

Of all people. Now say the truth.

Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon.

TERESA

I'm sleepy.

CHARLIE

You've been running round too much.

Bet you've been forgetting your

medicine.

TERESA

The green capsules in the top drawer.

FANTASY

42.

GROPPI

What do you want kid?

GROPPI

What do you want?.......well?

CHARLIE

I...I'm selling encyclopedias...er

GROPPI

We don't want no fuckin' books!

REALITY

BOY

There's nobody here mister.

CHARLIE

Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?

BOY

Yeah. But he ain't here now.

CHARLIE

Know where he is?

BOY

Follow me.

43.

CHARLIE

How much farther?

CHARLIE

(CONFESSION)

Now, don't get excited.

CHARLIE

(CONTINUED)

'The stone which the builders'

reject will become the

cornerstone'...I think.

GIOVANNI

Play it again!!!

EVERYONE

One more time...play it again...

GIOVANNI

(SHOUTING BOISTEROUSLY

over the music)

Take a drink!

CHARLIE

(SHOUTING)

Ok.

44.

GIOVANNI

Hey, where you been?

CHARLIE

(SMILING NERVOUSLY)

Oh...around...why?

GIOVANNI

(LEANING CLOSER)

You heard what happened to GROPPI,

eh?

CHARLIE

(INNOCENTLY)

Who me? ...No, I don't know, not

me...all I know is...

GIOVANNI

(cuts CHARLIE off

with a gesture of his forefinger)

Our friend, Groppi, went to his

mother's house. And when he was

there...at night...

CUT TO:

GIOVANNI

(continues in voice over)

...he walks into his mother's room

where she's watching

television...and he says to her...

GIOVANNI

...that he's sorry.

OLD WOMAN

It's all right.

45.

GIOVANNI

(voice over continued)

...he goes in the next room...

GIOVANNI

(voice over continued)

...he takes a gun and puts it in

his mouth and...

FAST FADE TO WHITE

GIOVANNI

(with an Italian hand gesture)

...so...

GIOVANNI

(SMILING)

How do you like that, eh? He was

always a little crazy, y'know...

Groppi... a little crazy.

CHARLIE

(GRUDGINGLY)

Not now...in a few minutes...ok?

CUT TO:

MICHAEL

I gave him all the breaks I can give.

46.

CHARLIE

Oh Michael, look...

MICHAEL

Nevamind 'look'...This punk

bastard...I call him at work...I

say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He

doesn't even show up for work

anymore...

CHARLIE

Look...I've talked to him and I've

talked to him...what more can I

do...? Tonight at the party all

three of us get together and we

knock some sense into his head...ok?

MICHAEL

All right...but understand, I don't

like being taken advantage of. I

mean you're in there talking with

your uncle and all...This is

embarassing.

CHARLIE

We'll settle it tonight.

BOY #1

Hey, you sell firecrackers?

CHARLIE

Firecrackers! No...no.

BOY #1

You know where we can get some?

CHARLIE

Sure, see that guy over there...

CHARLIE

(CONTINUING)

...him. He's got the best.

BOY #1

Hey - fella...you sell firecrackers?

47.

MICHAEL

Sssh! Quiet.

(He looks around)

Y'know that's illegal.

BOY #2

Well the guy over there said...

MICHAEL

(INTERRUPTING)

Yeah, yeah, never mind. You gotta

be careful.

BOY #1

We went down to Chinatown but they

don't have any.

MICHAEL

Yeah, well, keep away from those

Chinx. They don't have shit.

BOY #2

Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...

MICHAEL

(INTERRUPTING)

All right! Quiet! For $40 I could

give you...

BOY #1

Well, I don't know if we want to

buy all $40 worth...

MICHAEL

Hey! You want good stuff, or you

want shit?

BOY #2

Well, we want good stuff.

MICHAEL

Well, my stuff comes from Maryland...

you know what that means?

BOY #1

No.

MICHAEL

That means it's good.

BOY #1

You got sparklers?

48.

MICHAEL

Yeah.

BOY #2

And cherry bombs...ash cans...and

rockets?

MICHAEL

Ok. For another $5.00 a special on

the packs.

BOY #1

No, all we got is $40.

MICHAEL

You sure?

BOYS

Yeah.

MICHAEL

Ok. Wait here.

MICHAEL

(to the boys)

C'mon. Get in the car.

MICHAEL

Ok, you guys get out, and wait here

for me.

BOYS

Why?

MICHAEL

I gotta get the stuff.

BOYS

Can't we come with you?

MICHAEL

Nobody sees where I get the stuff.

That's good business. I'll be back

in thirty minutes.

49.

MICHAEL

Hey hold it! Gimmie the cash.

BOYS

Uh...can we give you a check?

MICHAEL

A check? What the...hey, where you

kids from?

BOY #1

Riverdale.

MICHAEL

(CONTEMPTUOSLY)

Well, maybe they do that in

Riverdale, but down here we take

cash. Now, you got it or not?

MICHAEL

Ok. Now wait here...and keep your

mouths shut!

TONY

How much?

MICHAEL

Not bad. $20. Here, $5.

TONY

Can you spare it?

MICHAEL

Sure.

TONY

(SARCASTICALLY)

Thanks.

TONY

Hey Charlie. Get in.

50.

CHARLIE

What's a'matter?

MICHAEL

Nothin'. Just stiffed those kids.

Don't want'em comin' back and

findin' you...start asking you

questions.

CHARLIE

How much?

MICHAEL

$20.

CHARLIE

Let's go to the movies...on you.

TONY

Yeah.

MICHAEL

Ok guys...have a heart. This is my

business.

BLACK & WHITE

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

51.

CHARLIE

(CONFESSION)

You know damn well what's going to

happen tonight. I'll probably get

drunk at that party...it isn't

every day you send one of your best

friends off to war for God and

country... gotta have a party. I

mean, he's a nice kid.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

(VOICE OVER)

I don't know what You think of him

but that's between You and him

anyway...I can't help feeling sorry

for him though. Has a talent but

doesn't use it...His brain. An

'Unprofitable servant who shall be

cast forth into the darkness

outside, where there will be...

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

(continued voice over)

...the weeping and the gnashing of

teeth'...or something like that.

My talent's my brain too but I use

my talent...I'm not saying that I'm

a genius...You'll probably be the

first one to agree on that, but I

can tell the difference between the

intelligent and the stupid. Take

the army for example...

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

(continued voice over)

That's there and I'm here and

that's the way it's going to stay!

52.

CUT TO:

TERESA

Oh sure! I know her Michael...In

fact, I saw her a few days ago

under a bridge in Jersey, making

out with a nigger.

MICHAEL

You sure?...a nigger...Uh!...and I

kissed her.

53.

TONY

(SMILING)

Hallelujah!!

CHARLIE

I have come to create order...

Scotch and water please.

CHARLIE

May God be with you.

TONY

'And with your spirit.'

CHARLIE

(gesturing with his drink)

Salute!!!

TONY

(taking on the guise

of an interviewer)

'Art thou the King of the Jews'?

CHARLIE

'Dost thou say this of thyself, or

have others told thee of me?'

54.

TONY

'Am I a Jew? Thy own people and

the chief priests have delivered

thee to me. What hast thou done?'

CHARLIE

'My kingdom is not of this world.

If my kingdom were of this world my

followers would have fought that I

might not be delivered to the Jews.

But, as it is my kingdom is not

from here.'

TONY

'Thou art then a king?'

CHARLIE

'Thou sayest it; I am a king. This

is why I was born and why I have

come into this world, to bear

witness to the truth. Everyone who

is of the truth hears my voice.'

TONY

'What is the truth?'

TONY

Prophesy to us, oh Christ! Who is

it that struck thee?

CHARLIE

I don't know, but God help him if

he does it again!

CHARLIE

He said he'd be here.

55.

MICHAEL

Well, he isn't. Nice...real nice.

CHARLIE

He'll be here. Look, take this for

now.

MICHAEL

You kiddin. The way it is now this

isn't even interest for two hours.

CHARLIE

(putting the bill

back into his pocket)

How much was the original loan again?

MICHAEL

$500. He borrowed that because he

wanted to pay off his other loans...

now, counting the interest...it's

almost $3,000.

CHARLIE

$3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at

$3,000?

MICHAEL

Charlie, this is business.

CHARLIE

(avoiding the issue)

'But I say to you, love your

enemies, do good to those who hate

you, and pray for those who

persecute...'

MICHAEL

I'll tell you who you can pray

for... Next payday, I'll be at

Tony's Place...Johnny better show

or I find him and break his

legs...and I mean it.

CHARLIE

(in the same manner)

'But I say to you not to resist the

evildoer; on the contrary, if

someone takes thy tunic, let him

take thy cloak as well...to him who

asks of thee, give; and from him

who would borrow of thee do not

turn away!

56.

MICHAEL

(EXASPERATED)

He could at least show some respect

and show his face, even if he

doesn't have the money...

CHARLIE

(more serious now)

'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not

come out from it until thou hast

paid the last penny.'

MICHAEL

You said it.

CUT TO:

EVERYONE

Blasphemy!...The anti-Christ!

Crucify him!!

CHARLIE

'Father...forgive them...for they

know not...what they do...'

57.

TERESA

Charlie...? Charlie here...?

CUT TO:

BLACK & WHITE

TERESA

(FRANTICALLY)

The building on the corner. That

one! He's been on the roof a half

hour now!

CHARLIE

Now don't get excited. Don't get

excited!!

FRIENDS

Charlie, stay there...He's crazy...

He's got a 22.

CHARLIE

Johnny it's me, Charlie.

JOHNNY BOY

Don't come any closer!!!

CHARLIE

Cut it out stupid. It's me.

BLACK & WHITE

58.

JOHNNY BOY

Charlie...pssst. Over here.

CHARLIE

What are you...crazy?

JOHNNY BOY

Hey...don't do that...I'm only

scaring them.

CHARLIE

Stupid bastard...you get your

cousin half-sick over this.

JOHNNY BOY

Watch this.

CHARLIE

What the fuck...

CHARLIE

Let's get out of here.

JOHNNY BOY

(LAUGHING)

Did you see them run!

BLACK & WHITE

59.

JOHNNY BOY

I swear to God Charlie...my arm

still hurts from the car

accident...that's why I didn't go

to work. I swear it.

CHARLIE

(ANGRY)

That's not going to help.

JOHNNY BOY

I'm going to work this week...I

mean it.

CHARLIE

It's impossible for you to catch up

on the loan now...the interest is

going up...$3,000...do you realize

that, flash?

JOHNNY BOY

I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.

CHARLIE

Big deal...in the meantime, it's

done...I'll still try to help you

out...You know that...but you gotta

show some effort...some respect...

understand?

JOHNNY BOY

Charlie, you know the best way to

take care of this whole mess.

CHARLIE

How?

JOHNNY BOY

(COAXING)

If you had a little talk with your

uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.

CHARLIE

That'll help you out fine. That's

the best way for you, not for me!

I swear to God, I'll rip you open

if my uncle ever hears a word about

this. You understand? I don't

care what happens, he doesn't find

out.

(MORE)

60.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

I don't get involved with anything,

you understand that? Nothing! I'm

clean as far as you know...right?

JOHNNY BOY

Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.

CHARLIE

That's what I get for getting

involved. Look, on pay-day at

least show up at Tony's Place to

meet him, ok? This way he doesn't

think that you're trying to screw

him. If you show good faith and

save his face maybe we can talk and

he'll take off the interest or make

different payment arrangements or

something... understand? I'm not

asking I'm telling you!!

JOHNNY BOY

I understand.

CHARLIE

'Could you not, then, watch one

hour with me?'

CHARLIE

'The spirit is willing but the

flesh is weak.'

61.

CUT TO:

OSCAR

Put the menus away. I, personally

do the cooking tonight.

GIOVANNI

Fine...that's why I'm here.

MARIO

Calamari?

OSCAR

Capozelle, Calamari...anything you

want...

GIOVANNI

(POURING WINE)

Drink.

DISSOLVE TO:

OSCAR

Giovanni...er...can I talk?

OSCAR

About the place, Giovanni...

62.

GIOVANNI

...I know all about it. We'll

discuss it later.

OSCAR

(CONTINUING)

Our arrangements about the place

haven't changed, have they? I

mean...

GIOVANNI

(GOOD-NATUREDLY)

No, no, not at all...look, we leave

it the way it is for now, we talk

later, understand?

OSCAR

(SOMEWHAT RELIEVED)

Sure, Giovanni...I understand.

I'll bring the clams now.

DISSOLVE TO:

CHARLIE

I really couldn't believe it when

you told me, you know that?

GIOVANNI

Well, he was always a little

crazy... he puts a gun in his

mouth...

(HE SMILES)

...like your friend...comme si

chiama...Henning? Heming?

CHARLIE

Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was

more upset about that than about

Groppi, that's for sure.

GIOVANNI

(laughing to MARIO)

You know, this boy over here, once,

long time ago, tried to enrich my

mind...so he gives me a book by

this Hemin fella...to read, so I

read it.

63.

CHARLIE

Wasn't a book...was a short story.

MARIO

What was it?

CHARLIE

(EMBARRASSED)

Nothing.

MARIO

No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.

CHARLIE

(MUTTERING)

"Francis Macomber."

MARIO

Wha?

CHARLIE

(SOFTLY)

"Short Happy Life of Francis

Macomber."

MARIO

Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw

the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty

good.

GIOVANNI

Yeh, Mario over here, he reads a lot.

GIOVANNI

Surprised?

MARIO

I like this Harold Robbins...

CHARLIE

(POLITELY)

Oh yes, he's pretty good.

GIOVANNI

What I don't understand is why you

have to go to college to read these

books that you're gonna read anyway.

64.

CHARLIE

It's only a couple of courses...just

for the draft.

MARIO

Charlie, couple of courses isn't

enough to get you student deferred...

I mean if they wanted to draft you,

you would've been drafted by now.

GIOVANNI

What Mario's trying to tell you,

Charlie, is that you're wasting

your time with those "couple of

courses" ...you don't need them.

There are a lot of things that can

be taken care of...you know what I

mean?

DISSOLVE TO:

GIOVANNI

These politicians...they talk nice.

GIOVANNI

(CONTINUING)

...but it's the same thing, all the

same...they're in there by having

something on somebody...and when

that doesn't work...they fight...Our

life has honor...we have no show to

put on because we do what we have

to do. They know where to come

when they need us. I realize this

during the war...World War II...Vito

Genovese... during WWII he worked

with the government, taking care of

the docks...

CHARLIE

What did he do?

65.

GIOVANNI

What did he do? He was there...

that's what he did.

MARIO

In the fifties when the communists

started in with this country and

they tried to clean them out, we

offered to do it for them...but

they didn't want us to...so we kept

out of it.

GIOVANNI

(TO CHARLIE)

I told this...the same thing to

your father thirty years ago...I

told him what to do...but he didn't

listen.

GIOVANNI

You're still around with that kid

Johnny Boy...last night with that

gun...Don't get mixed up with them.

This Johnny Boy, you know, he's

named after me...

(SARCASTIC)

nice, eh? This Johnny Boy is like

your mister Groppi...a little crazy.

It's nice you should help him out

because of his family and our

family but watch yourself...Don't

spoil anything.

GIOVANNI

(CONFIDENTIALLY)

His whole family has problems...his

cousin, the girl who lives next

door to you...

CHARLIE

Teresa.

GIOVANNI

...The one who's sick, right? In

the head.

66.

CHARLIE

No, she's got epilepsy.

GIOVANNI

Yeah. That's what I said, sick in

the head.

GIOVANNI

Her mother and father come to me

and ask advice...she wants to

leave...get her own

apartment...worries them sick...what

am I gonna tell them? Lock her up?

CHARLIE

What do they expect you to say?

GIOVANNI

Who knows? It's not hard to figure

out what she'll wind up like. When

the respect for parents breaks

down, that's bad...you know I'm

"cumpari" with them...so I take an

interest. You live next door, keep

an eye open...but don't get involved.

CHARLIE

All right.

MARIO

Why don't you take a look around

the place if you want?

CHARLIE

Oh, that's ok...I've been in and

out of this place fifty times.

GIOVANNI

Well, maybe you missed something?

CHARLIE

(CATCHING ON)

Oh yeah, that's a possibility.

CHARLIE

(CONFESSION)

...looks good...things look good,

if I may say so myself. Don't you

agree? Unless there's something

You know that I don't know?

CUT TO:

67.

COOK

Hi Charlie.

COOK

(CONTINUING)

Man, it's hot as Hell in here,

every day like going through Hell

in here.

CHARLIE

(SMILING)

Hot as hell...You're not the only

one going through Hell kid.

COOK

Maybe so...but at this pay it ain't

worth it...that much I can tell you.

CHARLIE

(CONFESSION)

'If thy hand is an occasion of sin

to thee, cut it off. It is better

for thee to enter into life maimed

than having two hands to go into

hell, into the unquenchable fire.

'Where their worm dies not and the

68.

TONY

Is it near Sullivan Street?

JIMMY

No - by Bedford.

TONY

Oh - you gotta show me. I always

get lost in the village.

CHARLIE

Next time, bet with your own kind.

JIMMY

The number was 235 - I bet it

combination.

CHARLIE

It'll be OK - I know those guys.

They won't stiff you.

JIMMY

I bet 235. Because I dreamt of my

grandfather - and when he died, the

number of the funeral parlour was

235 - so when I dreamt...

JOHNNY BOY

Yeah, yeah - enough.

JOEY

Hello Charlie, you canonized yet?

CHARLIE

No - not yet - just blessed.

CUT TO:

JIMMY

On Friday, the 25th--I placed it

JOEY

(BEING DISTRACT)

I never heard of it.

CHARLIE

Oh Joey, really...we're all friends

here--let's cut the bullshit.

JOEY

(begins to chuckle)

...Well...

(TO JIMMY)

you got a good friend here--come to

think of it, I do remember now.

JOHNNY BOY

(under his breath)

SCUMBAG--

TONY

(nudging JOHNNY BOY)

(under his breath)

Shut up.

JOEY

(MAKING EXCUSE)

Well, Friday's are busy--a mistake

can be made y'know. Have another

drink.

CHARLIE

Whatever, just lets settle this and

it's all forgotten.

JOHNNY BOY

I don't forget nothin.

JOHNNY BOY

Lower the fuckin music--I can't

hear nothin.

JOEY

The girls like it loud.

JOHNNY BOY

Girls? You call those skanks girls?!

70.

JOEY

(TO CHARLIE)

What's the matter with this kid?

JOHNNY BOY

I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.

CHARLIE

Keep your mouth shut.

JOHNNY BOY

You tell me that in front of these

creeps?

JOEY

We won't pay...

JIMMY

Why? We just said...

JOHNNY BOY

(INTERRUPTING)

We won't pay...because this guy

(pointing to JIMMY)

is a...mook.

JIMMY

But I didn't say nothin.

JOEY

(TO JIMMY)

We don't pay mooks!

JIMMY

(ANGRILY)

A mook...I'm a mook...

(PAUSES)

What's a mook?

JIMMY

You can't call me a mook!

71.

JOEY

We were gonna pay you Jimmy, we

just don't like being moved in on.

CHARLIE

C'mon -- I'm movin' in on you?

Let's have another drink and forget

about it.

JOEY

Don't count it...it's all there.

JOHNNY BOY

(SARCASTIC)

Count it.

JOEY

Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.

JOHNNY BOY

Don't fuckin' touch me - scumbag.

CHARLIE

Shut up stupid.

72.

CHARLIE

You got some mouth!

JIMMY

Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.

JOHNNY BOY

What're ya hollering? You got your

No, really, I liked it...thought it

was great.

BOY

Thanks.

CHARLIE

What are your plans?

BOY

Well, we're here for about two

weeks, then whatever else comes

along... we're still working on our

album and...

CHARLIE

Great...great...listen, I'm very

interested in you guys because I'll

be opening a new club myself soon...

uptown...and maybe we can work

something out...

BOY

Sounds good.

CHARLIE

Of course, 'The Season of the

Witch' won't be ready for a while

yet but we have to keep in touch.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie. Listen,

we do out there...when you're

on...I... a...I really...think that

you're a terrific performer...

DIANE

Fine.

CHARLIE

No, I'm serious...You're really good.

DIANE

I know.

CHARLIE

In a little while...I'm gonna have

the opportunity of opening my own

place...not here...much nicer than

this...uptown...sort of nite-club

and restaurant and everything.

DIANE

That's nice.

75.

CHARLIE

I was thinking maybe you'd do very

nicely for the place.

DIANE

Stripper?

CHARLIE

No...no stripping...as the hostess.

DIANE

Hostess?

CHARLIE

Yeah, you know...you greet the

people...see them to their tables...

well...it'll be different though...

Listen...why don't we get together

and talk after your show tonight.

DIANE

Chinese food?

CHARLIE

Ok. Chinese. We'll meet on the

...that sonofabitch.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TERESA

But Charlie...it's uptown and it's

perfect. It's big enough for two

people...she's going to get out by

the end of the month. If you don't

act right away, it'll go in no time.

What do you think?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

78.

TERESA

Don't you realize what that

apartment means?

TERESA

Do you? For both of us. Think...

after a while you might even be

able to move in yourself.

CHARLIE

Are you serious? Me move in with

you. You crazy?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

(CONTINUES)

Teresa, get these ideas out of your

head...I've got enough on my hands

right now...with that bastard

cousin of yours. You wanna move?

Go ahead. By all means! But keep

me out of it...I've got nothing to

do with it...you

understand...nothing.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE'S WINDOW

79.

CHARLIE

Where were you? Answer me, you

sonofabitch! Where were you?

CHARLIE

(TO TERESA)

Shut up!

JOHNNY BOY

(TO TERESA)

Yeah, Teresa, shut up! We don't

wanna get Charlie here in trouble,

do we?...We love Charlie.

CHARLIE

You had me going crazy!

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

Your cousin here was getting sick,

worrying about you. We've been in

here calling...

JOHNNY BOY

Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...

80.

JOHNNY BOY

(CONTINUES)

Well kids...have the bans been

announced yet?

CHARLIE

Don't be smart.

JOHNNY BOY

I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember.

I'm so stupid that you have to look

out for me, remember?

JOHNNY BOY

Don't be upset Teresa. You have to

understand Charlie, here...he gives

of himself to help others...

TERESA

I'm going to go home.

JOHNNY BOY

No, you stay.

CHARLIE

Johnny, I swear to God, if you open

your mouth about any of this...

JOHNNY BOY

(ANGRY)

Me? I wouldn't say a word to my

aunt and uncle...or even your

uncle, Charlie...

JOHNNY BOY

(SHOUTING)

Charlie...I always wondered about

her...what happens when she comes?

Does she get one of those fits? Eh?

That would be something to see...

81.

JOHNNY BOY

You rat bastard!! Don't hit me

again!!

JOHNNY BOY

I think I will fuckin go see your

uncle right now...he'd be interested.

CHARLIE

Go ahead! Go on! And we'll see

what happens to you without me.

TERESA

No...no...don't.

CHARLIE

What do I do? You know anything

about this?

JOHNNY BOY

I don't know...she's your girl...I

gotta go.

JOHNNY BOY

Hate to miss the floor show, though.

82.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

You crazy bastard! What are you

trying to do, ruin me?

CHARLIE

You...

CHARLIE

You threaten me with my uncle?

After what I'm doing for you?

JOHNNY BOY

What you're doing for me isn't

worth it...believe me!

CHARLIE

Then don't show up tonight and see

what happens.

CHARLIE

How much have you got for Michael

tonight?

83.

JOHNNY BOY

I only got eight bucks on me.

CHARLIE

Here, take twenty bucks. With your

eight that makes twenty-eight bucks

you give Michael. I keep the

thirteen for the weekend. Maybe

we'll eat some Chinese food later.

CHARLIE

Take it. I'm doing it for you,

stupid!

JOHNNY BOY

No you're not...

CHARLIE

Oh, cut it out, will ya?

JOHNNY BOY

Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is

nothing. The only way to do it is

through your uncle...think about it

will you?

CHARLIE

NO!!! What do you think I am,

crazy???

JOHNNY BOY

No, I just want to help myself,

that's all.

CHARLIE

Come on.

CUT TO:

TONY

You're over an hour late. Michael

said he'll be back later, though...

84.

CHARLIE

Watch this kid for me. I have to

go someplace but I'll be back soon

to get Michael and him together.

Don't even let him go to the

bathroom.

CHARLIE

Don't you move!!!

JOHNNY BOY

(SULKING)

I'll be here. Don't worry.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

6th Avenue and Waverly Place, fast

please.

CAB DRIVER

Where do you want me to stop?

CHARLIE

No...don't stop...just pass real

slow, OK?

CHARLIE

Stop here.

(HE HESITATES)

No...what am I...crazy??? Take me

back to where you picked me up.

85.

CAB DRIVER

(SIGHING)

Ok.

CUT TO:

JOHNNY BOY

Back so soon.

CHARLIE

Mind your own business.

TERESA

Hey, cut it out. Will ya?

CHARLIE

(CONFESSION)

You can see things aren't going too

well for me at the moment. My

willpower and powers of persuasion

are not what they usually are today.

My ability to control events and

situations are wanting. I know. I

know...what can I say...I offer

this as part of my penance.

CHARLIE

(TO TONY)

Who's the girl?

TONY

Jewish...

CHARLIE

How do you know?

86.

TONY

Look at her.

CHARLIE

She don't look Jewish.

TONY

Sure she is. She's always in here

with some different guy. You know

the way they are.

CHARLIE

I love you.

CHARLIE

(SMILING)

Ever since that first day I saw you

at the convent with the nuns,

playing volleyball, I couldn't help

myself.

GIRL

You Italian?

CHARLIE

Yeah why?

GIRL

You don't look it.

GIRL

(to the Boy)

Fuck off.

BOY

(STUNNED)

What do you mean?

(he looks at CHARLIE)

...let's go.

GIRL

You go...I'm staying.

BOY

Let's go!

87.

CHARLIE

It's obvious that the girl doesn't

want to accompany you, isn't it?

BOY

Look fella...this is private...

CHARLIE

Nothing's private...

GIRL

I'd like to leave.

CHARLIE

Whether she wants to or not...she's

not going.

BOY

Let go of her.

GIRL

Stop it...you're hurting me.

CHARLIE

Take her away from me...I mean

physically take her away from me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

88.

MICHAEL

What's it gonna be? I was here

tonight...you kept me waiting for

over an hour.

JOHNNY BOY

Hello, Michael. I've got something

for you...not much...but...

CHARLIE

He has about twenty-eight bucks...

it's all he has on him.

MICHAEL

Better than nothing.

MICHAEL

Where's the rest?

CHARLIE

Yeah, where's the rest?

JOHNNY BOY

I bought a few rounds of drinks

while waiting.

MICHAEL

(ANGRY)

Twenty-eight bucks is enough of an

insult...I was gonna take the

twenty-eight bucks because of

Charlie here...but ten bucks!

89.

JOHNNY BOY

You make me laugh, Michael...you

know that? I've borrowed money all

over the neighborhood and never

paid it back...so I couldn't borrow

anymore from them...so who's the

only jerk off left that I can

borrow from without paying

back...YOU. Because that's what I

think of you...Jerk off. I fuck

you where you breathe!

CHARLIE

(MUTTERING)

You're really crazy.

MICHAEL

You're not going to use that gun,

Johnny.

MICHAEL

You don't have the guts to use

that...be seeing you Charlie, Tony,

and of course you John...be seeing

you.

CHARLIE

You stupid bastard! Never pull a

gun unless you intend to use it.

TONY

(HOLDING GUN)

...No bullets in it.

90.

TONY

Get out of here before this really

goes up.

CHARLIE

Hide the gun. Throw it away.

Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow

your car...I think we should take a

ride...away from here for the

night...you know what I mean?

TONY

(RELUCTANTLY)

Ok...but go to a movie first or

something...not good to be driving

around right away. You know you

can't do much for him now...it's

out of your hands.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JOHNNY BOY

I think we should see your uncle.

CHARLIE

No.

JOHNNY BOY

This can't be settled any other way

now...I'll take full blame.

CHARLIE

Forget it.

91.

JOHNNY BOY

What are you going to do? Hide me?

CHARLIE

Good idea.

CHARLIE

(CONFESSION)

I guess you could safely say that

this evening has been so far very

unimpressive as far as my efforts

are concerned...more unproductive.

Now, I'd like to know what you do,

for an encore, Lord? I know

penance is penance but this is

something else.

JOHNNY BOY

What are you talking to yourself???

CHARLIE

(SARCASTIC)

Go ahead! Play the radio...play

music...you're going to a party...

louder! Go ahead. Louder. A

party. Lots of fun.

CHARLIE

Hey, what is this guy, crazy?

My uncle didn't come?

CUT TO:

MARIO

(pauses for a moment)

Giovanni says now he done enough.

He got you outta jail. Now...

(reaching in pocket)

he wants you outta the way.

MARIO

He says use it. Don't sell it. He

says he'll see you. Someday. Maybe.

MARIO

(ABRUPTLY)

Things worked out rotten kid. Sorry.

CUT TO:

95.

TONY

Where to?

CHARLIE

(PREOCCUPIED)

Kennedy.

TONY

(trying to be jolly)

I know, I know, stupid. I mean

where you goin'?

CHARLIE

It's an open ticket. I can go

anywhere up to $350.

TONY

So?

CHARLIE

(EDGY)

So I'll send you a postcard from

wherever. If I get there.

TONY

Nervous?

CHARLIE

Yeah.

TONY

You flew before?

CHARLIE

No.

CHARLIE

(IRRITATED)

Hey, come on...

TONY

Take it easy. I only asked because

maybe I could, you know, let you

have a little something.

CHARLIE

Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough

to hold me. My mother can send me

some. I don't know.

TONY

How about Teresa? I could talk...

CHARLIE

(trying not to be impatient)

Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll

handle it myself. I'll write.

TONY

And say what?

CHARLIE

I'll say that I'm travelling.

CUT TO:

TONY

Listen, try a place with some sun.

Swimming pools. Palm trees. Girls

in little French bathing suits.

CHARLIE

(SMILES)

Thanks for the ride.

CHARLIE

Take care of that tiger.

97.

TONY

(CORRECTING HIM)

Panther...

CHARLIE

Panther! Same thing...

TONY

Hey...no more good times like

before. Until you come back.

CHARLIE

Sure. And you're gonna take the

vows next Tuesday, right.

TONY

(LAUGHS)

Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.

TONY

See you.

CUT TO:

CHARLIE

I don't know what to say to you...

CLERK

May I help you?

CLERK

Sir, may I help you?

CHARLIE

(questioning, challenging)

Where can I go?
