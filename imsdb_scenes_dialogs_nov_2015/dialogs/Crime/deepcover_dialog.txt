SHOOTING DRAFT

JOE STEVENS

Your mother okay?

JOE JR.

Yes, sir.

JOE STEVENS

(firm, without irony)

Don't you do this shit, boy. Don't

you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear

me?

JOE STEVENS

(continuing)

You hear me, goddam it?

JOE STEVENS

(continuing; charged

up)

What do you want for Christmas?

JOE JR.

I don't know.

JOE STEVENS

(light changes; he

accelerates)

You don't know?? You gotta know what

you want, boy, if you ever expect to

get it.

JOE STEVENS

(continuing)

Wait here. This won't take a minute.

JOE JR.

Daddy!!

STORE OWNER

(enraged, almost to

tears)

Fuckin' niggers... fuckin' niggers...

JOE STEVENS

Fifty bucks... fifty goddam bucks.

(looks up at his son)

I'm sorry...

JOE JR.

Please, Mister...

DISSOLVE TO:

CARVER

Officer Leland? You know the

difference between a black man and

nigger?

CARVER

(continuing; pleasant

smile)

Yeah, most niggers don't.

CARVER

(continuing)

Nice to meet you.

CARVER

So, Winston, what's the difference

between a black man and a nigger?

WINSTON

Who the fuck do you think you're

talking to?

CARVER

Thanks for coming in.

STEVENS

The nigger's the one who falls for

your bullshit.

CARVER

Gerald Carver, United States District

Attorney. Call me Gerry.

STEVENS

He ought to be wearing a sign.

CARVER

You can tell he's a cop?

STEVENS

He keeps looking for his back-up.

Now, the other guy knows it, too.

CARVER

Then why's he taking him to the room?

STEVENS

(why else?)

To rip him off.

STEVENS

(continuing)

Too late.

TAFT

Oh, Bobby... Jesus, Jesus...

(to the CAMERA)

Get an ambulance -- and back up.

Now!

STEVENS

(focussed on Taft)

Who is he?

CARVER

Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics.

STEVENS

He's a good cop.

CARVER

He's a great cop. Two [names citation]

and a [another citation]. As tough

as they come and twice as honest.

STEVENS

But the cops aren't getting it done

here, are they? Gotta try something

new...

STEVENS

(continuing)

Who's John Hull?

CARVER

You are. If you want to be.

(off Stevens)

Most undercover guys don't know what

they're doing because it's a day

gig.

(indicates dead cop

on TV)

I need somebody who goes under and

stays there; six months, a year,

five years...

STEVENS

What does he have to do?

CARVER

Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me

information.

STEVENS

He's a snitch.

CARVER

He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A

scumbag. But for the right side.

(beat)

I want you to come to Los Angeles on

loan to the Justice Department as a

federal agent. Your experience there

will be credited toward your seniority

here. And you'll come back to

Cleveland a P3 or higher.

STEVENS

(uncomfortable)

I can't do that. I've got a wife and

kids.

CARVER

You're separated from your wife,

she's filled for divorce. You see

your kids every other weekend.

STEVENS

(almost a confession)

All my life I've stayed away from

that stuff. I've never touched drugs.

CARVER

(tolerant)

Come on, a little grass...?

STEVENS

Not grass. Not nothing. I never even

had a drink.

(his motto)

Never have, never will. You don't

understand. I made a choice in my

life.

CARVER

What's to understand? You saw your

father killed when you were ten, and

you decided you wouldn't be like

that.

(off Stevens' surprise,

Carver grins)

I'm God, I know everything. You wanted

to be a good boy, so you became a

cop. Hiding out in uniform... That's

why you got the hard-on for Taft.

STEVENS

It's not that simple.

CARVER

(opening Joe's file;

as if reluctantly)

I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're

never going to be a Taft.

STEVENS

I don't believe that.

CARVER

(looks at MMPI results)

You ever take a look at your

psychological profile? You score

almost like a criminal.

(reading)

"Resents authority..."

STEVENS

I do not.

CARVER

"...Exaggerated moral standards, but

with no underlying value system."

Look at the anger, the repressed

violence, it's almost off the scale...

STEVENS

Let me see that...

CARVER

Why'd you join the force?

STEVENS

(awkward, but felt)

I wanted to be of use.

CARVER

Well, now you can be. You won't be

Taft, but maybe you'll be something

more... interesting.

(sits back)

There's a man named Ramon Gallegos

who supplies 60% of the cocaine to

the West Coast. He's smart, smooth,

and sufficiently elusive that we

don't even have an adult photograph

of him. However, his uncle is Hector

Guzman, an important Latin American

political figure. Gallegos uses

Uncle's connections to get product

into the country, and everyone we've

sent after him has ended up like

that...

STEVENS

Why would I be different?

CARVER

You already are, that's the point...

(indicates file, test

scores)

You've got the ability and the

personality to go underground and

blend in completely. That's what the

others couldn't. Some part of them

showed. That's why they're dead.

See, there's only one rule in this

game.

CARVER

(continuing)

Don't blow your cover.

STEVENS

(calls to them)

Joe-J, Carmen...

STEVENS

What were you doing with those kids?

JOE-J & CARMEN

Playing...

STEVENS

(displeased)

Your mom lets you play with them?

JOE-J & CARMEN

Yes, sir... Yes, sir.

STEVENS

I thought we talked about this. The

older brother up there's got a sheet

with --

TERRY

Lay off it. They're just kids...

TITO

Hey, Joe.

STEVENS

Tito...

STEVENS

They're real nice, honey. Is that a

horse?

CARMEN

(exasperated)

Daddy! It's a bunny...

CARMEN

(continuing)

I don't want you to go away, Daddy.

STEVENS

It's my work. I've got to.

STEVENS

(continuing)

What happened to you there, baby?

CARMEN

Tito did it.

STEVENS

(instantly outraged)

He hit you?!

(up in a fury)

God damn it, what's he doing touching

her? I'm gonna...

TERRY

She was running behind his chair

when he got up. It was an accident.

(he's uncertain)

A complete... total... accident.

DISSOLVE TO:

BLONDE WOMAN

Television mostly. I was on "Sky

King" twice, "Ramar of the Jungle."

That was a silly show. The jungle

was mostly flats...

BLONDE WOMAN

(continuing)

You want my advice, I'd stay away

from that bitch.

EDDIE

On the day of the King's castration,

all the counts and no accounts were

down on the deck with Georgia Tech

taking turns in the back seat...

HULL

Whatta you got?

13-YEAR-OLD DEALER

(voice just changing)

Nickel rock, dime rock. Excellent

shit.

IVY

What the fuck I tell you about being

here?

13-YEAR-OLD DEALER (O.S.)

No, wait...

IVY (O.S.)

Too fuckin' late.

IVY

(enjoying it, shouting)

Get down, motherfuckers!

CROWD

Who is he?... Why'd they shoot him?...

Ivy did him, man... He's in the wrong

fuckin' place... That poor boy...

Get his beeper...

EDDIE

(sadly)

He done done, ain't he?

BARTENDER

How's it going, John?

HULL

I'm in there.

EDDIE

(to himself)

"Where's the Queen," said the King.

"She's in bed with laryngitis." "Is

that bastard still in town?... Fuck

the Queen," said the King, and ten

thousand knights straaaained at their

utmost...

(to the bartender)

Pina colada times two and a white

wine.

EDDIE

(continuing)

How you doin', Dudley...

HULL

John.

EDDIE

John, man, right...

HULL

Eddie something... a motormouth...

he supplies the street dealers...

buys from him...

(reads name on back

of photo)

David Elias... who apparently buys

from a guy named Barbolla or

something. But I haven't seen him.

CARVER

Barbosa, Felix.

HULL

There was also a woman, but she's

not here.

(as Carver reaches in

a drawer)

I saw a kid killed. Twelve, thirteen

at the most. Turf war.

CARVER

Get to Elias. Then to Barbosa.

HULL

You can't rush this stuff.

CARVER

Rush it, please. I want art, John,

not reality. Budget hearings start

in April, and I need Gallegos by

then. They won't give us funding for

three ounce buys.

HULL

We're not just doing this for the

funding, are we?

CARVER

Without funding, we aren't doing it

at all.

EDDIE

My man, Dudley, he's so fud-ley...

HULL

Eddie, man, I need...

CHORUS OF COMMENTS

Whatever happened to that Drug Czar

motherfucker?... He gave up 'cause

he finally realized he didn't know

nothing about any of that shit...

EDDIE

So what is it you need so bad, blood?

Need, need, need??

HULL

A whole K, quick as you can get it.

EDDIE

(impressed, a trace

of envy)

Comin' in the world, Dudley.

HULL

(winning grin)

All because of my man...

EDDIE

Give me a day.

EDDIE

(continuing)

Stick around, let the bitch Hoover

you, too.

HULL

Only if you Clorox him first.

TAFT

(cheerful, gregarious)

Eddie Shitface! Where you been, boy?

TAFT

(continuing)

Eddie, I don't think I introduced

you to my new partner, Michael

Hernandez...

HERNANDEZ

Pleased to meet you, Mr. Shitface...

HERNANDEZ

You have the right to remain silent...

You have the right to an attorney...

You have the right to go back to

Ontario for eight-to-ten on a second

offense...

EDDIE

(in several kinds of

pain)

Oh, man, I can't go back in there, I

just can't.

TAFT

(soothing)

'Course you can't, child, 'course

you can't. That's why you're gonna

start giving us some help.

ELIAS

Again. Three times four.

MIRANDA

Seven.

ELIAS

No. You're adding again, you have to

multiply. Three and four is seven.

Three times four is...

MIRANDA

Twelve.

ELIAS

Three times five.

NANCY

Can you get that?

MIRANDA

Eight.

ELIAS

(getting up; more

about the answer

than the door)

Damn it.

MIRANDA

Why can't I just use a calculator?

ELIAS

What are you doing here?

BARBOSA

We've got a problem, David.

ELIAS

Call me on the phone.

BARBOSA

Your friend Eddie just started bending

over for the cops.

BARBOSA

(continuing)

They busted him, and he's dealing to

save his ass.

GOPHER

Which is how he'll lose the skinny

little thing.

ELIAS

Did he give us up?

BARBOSA

Not yet, but he will if he has to,

and eventually he'll have to.

MIRANDA (O.S.)

Daddy! I thought we were doing my

homework.

ELIAS

I don't think he'd talk about us.

He'd try not to.

BARBOSA

If we whack him, he definitely won't.

MIRANDA (O.S.)

Daddy!!

ELIAS

(to Miranda)

Just a second.

(to Barbosa)

Not yet. Let me check on this, first.

BARBOSA

(taunting)

Nobody said you had to do the dirty

work, David. I'll take care of --

ELIAS

Felix, if he's a problem, we'll kill

him. I'll kill him myself.

ELIAS

(continuing)

Nancy, get out of here.

NANCY

For you; it's Eddie.

BARBOSA

You got a tasty wife, David. No wonder

you don't want us coming here.

ELIAS

(warning him)

Don't talk about her that way.

GOPHER

He can't help it, David, it's his

nature.

ELIAS

(into phone, chipper)

Eddie... Sure, man, what do you need?

EDDIE

David, this is John, John, David.

Eddie, this is Eddie. Everybody ready?

HULL

(to Elias)

So what's this, you want to meet me?

ELIAS

(charming, touch of

mockery)

I like to know the important

customers.

ELIAS

(continuing)

You're taking a lot of weight for a

guy we hardly know. Where're you

moving this stuff, John? We haven't

seen you around. We like to have a

sense who your customers are.

HULL

Ah, come on, man, do Macy's tell the

Gimbel motherfuckers?

ELIAS

(beat; watches him)

Eddie, forget this guy, he's a cop.

HULL

What is this shit, Eddie? I thought

you were the man.

EDDIE

Nobody's the fuckin' man. Go to your

place. I'll call you.

TAFT

This is our collar?

TAFT

(continuing)

Who is he?

HERNANDEZ

Some scumbag...

EDDIE

He's no cop, David. He's an animal.

You see his eyes? You never see a

cop with those eyes. I know this

shit, man, you don't.

ELIAS

(giving him an opening)

What's going on, Eddie?

EDDIE

Twenty-six thousand cash is what. We

need it, David. We're behind.

ELIAS

(a warning)

I want him to get it all, Eddie.

BELINDA

(a crackhead)

Mr. Hull... Mr. Hull...

HULL

(wearily)

What's happening, Belinda?

BELINDA

Now you know, Mr. Hull, I was to the

welfare this afternoon, but the bus,

you know what I'm saying?... the one

bus, and then the other, and when I

got there they'd gone and changed

the time on me, without notification.

They's supposed to give notification,

ain't they? They said I got a thing

in the mail, but I don't remember, I

don't think they sent it, so now I'm

off the welfare, plus I forgot to

take James for his shot... for the

school? Which otherwise they let him

go. And he's gotta learn, he's gotta

learn, don't he, Mr. Hull, you tell

him, so's he can better hisself.

HULL

(to James)

You had any food today, James?

JAMES

(disclaiming any need)

I had Ding-Dongs.

HULL

(sighs, gives him

money)

You go to the Mexican place over

there, and get the chicken tostada

or the beef and bean burrito or both.

And a milk.

JAMES

I don't like milk. I want a --

HULL

(an order)

You get the milk! And get something

for your mother, too.

(to Belinda)

What do you want?

BELINDA

Now, Mr. Hull, if you just --

HULL

(to James)

Two tostadas, two burritos, two milks.

BELINDA

You now, I look out for my James

best I can, Mr. Hull, but it's hard.

Now you like the boy, don't you?

BELINDA

(continuing)

I know you do. And I was thinkin' if

you wanted to take care of him, that

might be good for him. Give him a

male figure to look up to.

HULL

Look, Belinda, I can't...

BELINDA

If you could just give me something

for him. Say five thousand dollars...

(off Hull's shock)

Or maybe four thousand. I couldn't

give up my boy for less than four

thousand...

HULL

It's me. I'm here... Where?... five

minutes.

BELINDA

Or you could just give me a part

now...

BELINDA

(continuing)

Let me do somethin' for you, Mr.

Hull. Let me do a little somethin'

for you.

BLONDE WOMAN

No solicitin' in the halls. I told

you that before.

BELINDA

(spunkier than we've

seen)

I ain't doin' shit. Bitch...

AMPLIFIED VOICE

This is the police. Remain inside

the vehicle. Place your open hands

against the windshield so that they

are clearly visible...

HULL

Christ...

EDDIE

(a strategy)

Spread the floor, Dudley.

(rap sound effects

with rhythmic head

spasms)

A-ga, a-ga, a-ga, a-ga...

TAFT

(into car radio)

Thank you kindly...

TAFT

(continuing)

How you doin', child?...

HULL

(barely audible)

You...

TAFT

(briefly puzzled)

Me? Of course, it's me. You know me?

TAFT

(continuing)

Hurts, huh?

TAFT

(continuing)

Here, I want to show you something.

You have kids?

TAFT

(continuing)

These are mine. Aren't they the most

beautiful children you ever saw?

TAFT

(continuing)

Yeah, I know, they kind of leave you

speechless. So let me ask, if someone

put a gun to your baby's head,

wouldn't you kill him if you could?

TAFT

(continuing)

Me, too. And you're the bastard with

the gun.

HULL

(hoarse; his first

words)

You know the difference between a

nigger and a black man?

TAFT

Don't jive me, boy.

HULL

The nigger's the one covers Whitey's

ass by puttin' the brothers in jail.

TAFT

You ain't my brother.

PUBLIC DEFENDER

Hi, I'm Shelley Weissbrod. This is

only an arraignment, a preliminary

hearing, but if you don't have money

for an attorney, the Public Defender's

office can...

BAILIFF

You've got counsel. Over there.

HULL

You're a lawyer??

ELIAS

I'm your lawyer.

HULL

Who hired you?

ELIAS

(smiles)

It's pro bono. If you don't want me,

there's Shelley. She's good. She

just can't provide special services...

HULL

Like what?

VOICE (O.S.)

(calling the next

case)

John Hull...

ELIAS

Getting your case called first.

ELIAS

(continuing)

Your Honor, I believe the preliminary

police toxicology report will show

that the substance seized from my

client was Mannitol, a baby laxative.

We move for immediate dismissal.

ELIAS

(continuing; to Hull)

We're out of here, Dude.

TAFT

(to Hull, amused)

Baby laxative, they sold you some

bad shit.

DRUNKEN PRISONER

(to Hull)

You have a constipated baby, and

you're in jail? What kind of a father

are you?

TAFT

A father who don't know his own

children, ain't that right?

HULL

(under his breath)

You sold me Mannitol, motherfucker.

ELIAS

(under his)

If it hadn't been, asshole, you'd be

in jail right now... Come on, I want

you to meet some people.

EDDIE

Dudley, Dudley, Fo-Fudley...

ELIAS

Surprised to see him, Eddie?

ELIAS

(continuing)

John got busted and kept his mouth

shut. Can't say that for everybody,

can we?

EDDIE

What are you saying? Are you saying

me? Are you saying something about

me?

GOPHER

Tell the truth, Eddie. Be honorable.

It's all you got left.

EDDIE

Shut up, you little faggot.

ELIAS

The cops made you give them somebody.

We know it.

EDDIE

All right, so what? I mean, so what,

man? You got the money. Twenty-six

G. Twenty-six, David. Count it.

ELIAS

Next time you might trade us.

EDDIE

Never.

(turns to Barbosa)

Never, Felix, never. Come on, man,

you know I'd never...

BARBOSA

(softly)

I know you never will.

EDDIE

Felix, no. Don't be... I'm worth

money to you. Let me give you money.

BARBOSA

Why? You don't owe me anything.

EDDIE

Another twenty-six grand... Just to

show you... Fifty.

BARBOSA

Why not a hundred?

EDDIE

(that's so much)

A hundred??? Felix...

EDDIE

(continuing)

Okay, a hundred.

BARBOSA

Give it.

EDDIE

Tomorrow. Twenty-four hours.

BARBOSA

Now. Ten seconds.

EDDIE

Felix, I need time. I --

BARBOSA

One... two...

EDDIE

I don't have it right now. But I can --

GOPHER

(sadly)

Then goodbye, Eddie. I forgive you

for what you said to me.

EDDIE

(pleading)

Twelve hours. Tomorrow morning.

BARBOSA

Six... seven...

(to Elias)

You want to do it, David?

BARBOSA

(continuing)

Nine...

BARBOSA

Piece of shit!

BARBOSA

(continuing)

What'd you think?

HULL

At least it was clean.

BARBOSA

(pleased, to Elias)

What about you, bar mitzvah body?

First time you saw somebody die?

ELIAS

(eyes fixed on the

body)

No.

(catching breath)

At camp... when I was fourteen... a

friend of mine was water skiing...

The motorboat ran him over... A junior

counsellor was driving.

BARBOSA

You should kill a man some day, David,

it's liberating...

(walking out)

Summer camp. I'm in business with

somebody who went to summer camp.

ELIAS

Eddie, man... He was always nice to

my daughter.

HULL

How'd a guy like you get into this?

ELIAS

The way most drug lawyers do: clients

paid me in product, and I had to

move it. Soon I was doing more dealing

than law. But this was '83, '84,

there was so much money we thought

it would never end.

HULL

Yeah. And now...?

ELIAS

The road gets rougher. Cocaine's a

dying business.

HULL

Then what are we doing here?

ELIAS

People are always going to want to

get high. Every society has ways to

alter consciousness.

HULL

Because they can't bear reality.

ELIAS

(smiles)

We all need our delusions, only the

means change: psychedelics, opiates,

prayer, orgies, human sacrifice...

HULL

What's next?

HULL

(continuing)

Why aren't you selling it?

ELIAS

I know how to make it and market it.

But I need capital. That's the only

reason I'm hanging out with an asshole

like Barbosa.

(feels his hatred of

Barbosa)

And because I can't get to the big

guys.

HULL

Who are the big guys?

ELIAS

Gallegos, et cetera.

HULL

(reacts to the name)

Why can't you get to them?

ELIAS

What do you care?

ELIAS

(continuing)

Anyway, designer drugs have a bad

name: ice, ecstasy, tar -- there's a

limited market for Parkinson's

disease. But what about completely

safe, almost legal, terrific shit

you can go to work on and do your

job better than you ever did it

straight?

HULL

Sounds like a dream.

ELIAS

(closing the subject)

In dreams begin responsibilities.

HULL

Tell me about this new shit.

ELIAS

Some other time, John, when we know

each other better.

(as Miranda enters

kitchen)

Hey, bunnela.

(she snuggles against

him; Elias enjoys it)

Five times two.

MIRANDA

It's too early. Don't bother me.

MIRANDA

(continuing; head in

her father's chest)

Seven.

MIRANDA

(continuing)

Oh, yeah... Ten... Who's he?

ELIAS

That's my friend, John. This is

Miranda.

HULL

Hi, Miranda.

NANCY

Come on, honey...

ELIAS

Nancy, this is John.

ELIAS

(continuing; on Nancy's

chilliness)

That's not about you. It's, she's...

judgmental about what I do.

HULL

That's more than I bought.

ELIAS

Half we owe you. The other half's on

consignment. A token of our esteem.

HULL

You're having trouble moving it.

HULL

(continuing)

Make me your partner. I'll help you

get your capital.

ELIAS

I don't need a partner. I need a

salesman.

CARVER

I can't buy this much shit. I haven't

got it in the budget.

HULL

What am I supposed to do with it?

CARVER

You're a drug dealer, John. Deal

drugs.

HULL

You know how this goes, Gerry. It

won't stop here. You know what they're

going to ask me to do pretty soon,

to prove I'm down. What am I supposed

to do then?

CARVER

Don't blow your Carver.

CARVER (V.O.)

You're still thinking like a cop,

John. Forget that. Cross the line.

Be what you are. You're a criminal.

You don't give a shit about other

people. You're just trying to survive.

HULL (V.O.)

I can't do this shit. I just can't.

CARVER (V.O.)

But you want to be of use. You want

to get drugs off the street, don't

you?

HULL (V.O.)

That's why I'm here.

CARVER (V.O.)

Well, this is the cost. Pay it or go

grow flowers someplace.

HULL

You can't back down with them. You've

got to project strength, from inside,

you know?

HULL

Cocksucker...

DEALER

(hurt, confused)

What'd you do that for?

HULL

(walking off)

'Cause I can, motherfucker, 'cause I

can.

HULL

...Touch her again, motherfuckers,

I'm gonna mess you up.

HULL

Is David Elias here?

ELIAS (O.S.)

Momentito...

ELIAS

Jacqueline, ho-ney...

ELIAS

(continuing)

"Who's making love to your old lady...

while you're out make love...?"

(cheerful)

How come I like balling black chicks

so much?

HULL

'Cause you're a racist asshole. You

feel like you're fucking a slave,

and it gets you off.

ELIAS

Oh, don't mau mau me with the Malcolm

X shit. Tell me you're not chasin'

white pussy every chance you get.

HULL

I don't dig white women.

(knowing that's a lie)

Even if I did, it wouldn't mean the

same thing.

ELIAS

Sure, it'd be the slave fucking the

master. Hegel talks about it. Just

like me, but the other way around.

HULL

Fuck Hegel. Who the fuck is Hegel?

Some smart-ass kike that talks

backwards?

ELIAS

Everybody digs the other, John. They

dig their own, and they dig the other.

HULL

Does your wife dig black guys, David?

Did she fuck Eddie? Does she want to

fuck me?

ELIAS

(mock-terrified)

Ooo... you mean with that great big

purple dick of yours? I hope not.

She'd never be impressed with my

little thing again.

HULL

You think what impresses her now is

your dick?

ELIAS

(musing)

What does impress her?

ELIAS

Betty, this is John, my new associate.

MCCUTCHEON

Your new Eddie. I hear the old one

wore out.

ELIAS

Factory recall. John's going to be a

good customer. He does a lot of wash.

HULL

So how's this place work?

ELIAS

Betty wires the money to a store in

Aruba in payment for things they

never sent her. They deposit the

money in a bank there that turns

around and loans her money she never

has to repay. That way it doesn't

turn up as income for the IRS. Welcome

to the laundromat.

MCCUTCHEON

David, you talk too much.

ELIAS

She doesn't trust you.

HULL

How much is this?

MCCUTCHEON

More than you can afford.

HULL

I'll take it.

ELIAS

By all means.

MCCUTCHEON

(offering him the

straw)

Come on, Eddie 2... you're up.

HULL

No, thanks.

MCCUTCHEON

Who is he, my mother?

HULL

(smiles)

Never have, never will.

MCCUTCHEON

(taunting Hull)

Oooh... Cocaine, I love it and I

hate it and I love it. The disease

is the cure.

MCCUTCHEON

(continuing)

Don't look at me. Elias, tell him

not to look at me. I don't like the

fucker.

ELIAS

(sniffling)

John's an ascetic Negro; he wants to

make sure you know he's not a jungle

bunny.

HULL

Watch your mouth, David.

ELIAS

But he's got another side. You should

seen him on the street the other day

with these two USC kids. Do the spade

bit for her, John.

(black accent)

I'm gonna mess you up, muthafugga...

HULL

Don't call me a spade. And don't

tell me to play black.

ELIAS

(hurt, disappointed)

Come on, John, you do it so well.

(falling into it)

Ah ain't playin', muthafucka. Ah

ain't playin'.

ELIAS

(continuing)

Don't fuckin' dis me, muthafucka.

Fucka... fucka... fucka a... fucka

b... fuck b-hive... fucka, fucka,

fucka...

HULL

Say it again, and I'll kill you.

MCCUTCHEON

Grow up, assholes!

DEALER

...The guy ripped me off, man, so I

don't got the money, I don't got the

stuff and --

HULL

(eyes on street)

You gotta pay anyway.

DEALER

Oh, but, man...

HULL

Shit...

HULL

(continuing)

Bijoux!!

ELIAS

It wasn't your fault.

(no response)

What could you have done?

HULL

She worked for me. I'm supposed to

protect her.

ELIAS

We have to kill him.

ELIAS

(continuing)

Or we lose all authority with the

other dealers. And one of them'll

kill you.

ELIAS

(continuing)

You've got to assert now, or you're

dead.

ELIAS

(continuing)

And if we kill Ivy, we control this

whole territory.

HULL

That guy who works for Barbosa can

do it, Chino.

ELIAS

No. If we use Chino, it's Barbosa

who's asserting. It'll be Barbosa's

territory.

(again: his hatred of

Barbosa)

It's gotta be us.

HULL

Right.

ELIAS

And if it's us, it's gotta be you.

HULL

(to himself)

Don't blow your cover.

ELIAS

What?

HULL

If I do this, we're partners. Equal

partners on everything.

HULL

(continuing)

Let's go.

ELIAS

(afraid)

Now...?

HULL

Go wait around back.

ELIAS

I want to see you in that alley.

IVY

What're you looking at?

IVY

(continuing)

You want to suck it, bitch?

(offers his dick)

Or drink it?

IVY

(continuing;

recognizing him)

Oh, I know you. You're the bitch

whose whore I wasted tonight, ain't

you?

IVY

(continuing)

I gotta take care of you, too, huh?

HULL

...Carmen, it's me. It's Daddy...

CARMEN

Daddy!!

HULL (V.O.)

(through phone)

Hi, baby. How are you? I miss you!

CARMEN

What?

HULL (V.O.)

I miss you...

CARMEN

(thrilled)

I miss you, too, Daddy...

VOICE

(young, nasal, too

smart)

The maze leads in two directions. At

one end the rat can obtain a food

pellet. At the other...

(pointer indicates

each end)

...it receives electrical stimulus

to a very specific area of the

cerebellum...

VOICE

(continuing)

This rat, like 86% of the others in

the experiment, chose the electrical

stimulus repeatedly and exclusively.

It continued to do so until it died

of malnutrition.

CAL TECH

This is an addictive amphetamine

with time-space distortion, delusions

of grandeur -- or maybe they're real --

tending to be impulsive, sometimes

violent behavior. Psychotropic

adaptation for late monopoly

capitalism. It's illegal, and you

can buy it on any street corner.

CAL TECH

(continuing)

This increases energy, attention,

cognitive powers, yet with a smooth,

almost opiate-like emotional surface.

Ideal for the post-political, post-

rationalist global marketplace and

24 hour lifestyles. It's completely

legal and can only get it here, in

my lab.

ELIAS

(to Hull, proudly)

Randy's a genius. His professor told

him he could win the Nobel prize.

CAL TECH

Nobel prizes are for wussies.

HULL

What does this shit do to you?

CAL TECH

I'm on it now. It's like cocaine

only better.

(offers him powder on

a slide)

Want some?

HULL

I don't take drugs.

CAL TECH

(unoffended)

Your mistake. This is designed for

the top end of the market. For people

who want to master reality, not avoid

it. Because it's synthetic, you don't

grow it, refine it, or -- best of

all -- import it.

ELIAS

What would it take to manufacture

this stuff in quantity?

CAL TECH

With a million dollars, I could

produce enough for a limited market

at about two bucks a pop.

(makes a face: fair)

But then with five million, or better

yet ten, the cost would drop to thirty

cents, and we'd have enough for the

whole world.

ELIAS

I'm going to put two hundred fifty

thousand into your corporate account.

You cheat me, Randy, I'll use your

bladder for a bagpipe.

(to Hull, with a

vengeance)

We're going to put Barbosa out of

business.

CARVER

(dismissive)

Synthetic shit?? Sounds like a 20/20

segment...

CARVER

(continuing)

So, what was it like?

HULL

(still looking out)

What was what like?

CARVER

Popping Ivy...

HULL

You knew.

CARVER

I'm God, remember?

HULL

(looks back out)

Then you should know how it was.

CARVER

You didn't clear it with me. You're

getting independent. That's good.

CARVER

(continuing)

How're we coming on Gallegos?

HULL

He supplies Barbosa. To get to him

we'll have to take quantity.

CARVER

Then you've got to --

HULL

That's what killing Ivy did. I'll

get to him soon.

HULL

(continuing)

Is that it?

CARVER

(seeing him to the

door)

I want you to get a new apartment.

Something expensive.

HULL

I like where I am.

CARVER

That shithole? You're big time now.

Act it. And get some clothes. Spend

money. Have fun. That's an order.

HULL

Whether I'm here or not, no one else

uses that room. And change the linen

twice a week, just like now.

(starts to go, stops,

more money)

And make sure James gets what he

needs. And something for you.

ELIAS

(impressed, envious)

Nice place. Nice suit.

HULL

Hey...!

ELIAS

You pick all this shit out yourself?

HULL

A Jewish lady in the store helped

me.

ELIAS

(mock touched by racial

harmony)

Aw... Very nice. Understated. I'm

impressed.

HULL

(to himself)

Fifty bucks, fifty fucking bucks...

ELIAS

You sold it all?

ELIAS

(continuing)

I'll order a couple more keys from

Barbosa.

HULL

Order ten.

ELIAS

Ten??

HULL

Better twenty.

ELIAS

(afraid of that)

I don't want to push it.

HULL

I do. We've got a bigger territory,

we need more product. I want to deal

directly with Gallegos. It would

save us money.

ELIAS

Barbosa'll never let us near him.

HULL

If we buy twenty, Gallegos'll come

to us himself.

ELIAS

How do you know?

HULL

When I bought a key from Eddie, you

came to me.

HULL

(continuing)

Who's above Gallegos?

ELIAS

Guzman, but he's... Don't ask so

many questions.

HULL

How else will I learn?

(hint of a threat)

Call Barbosa, David, put in our

order... Because we have to split

this, and there isn't enough here

for both of us.

BETTY'S VOICE

(annoyed)

Nobody's home, go away.

MCCUTCHEON

(doesn't want to let

him in)

Look, I'm tired, why don't you...

MCCUTCHEON

Why do you look at me like that?

HULL

How do I look at you?

MCCUTCHEON

Like you know something I don't.

Like you're better than me.

HULL

I don't think I'm better than you. I

don't think I'm better than anybody.

HULL

(continuing)

But I do know something... You can't

stop thinking about me.

MCCUTCHEON

Let's go back here...

MCCUTCHEON

(indicates coke)

Do this... do it with me.

MCCUTCHEON

(continuing)

This is where I'm at. You want to be

with me, it's gotta be there.

HULL

I don't do that.

MCCUTCHEON

Never have, never will.

HULL

It's for fuck-ups.

MCCUTCHEON

What do you think, you're not a

nigger? You're a nigger as much as

me.

HULL

More.

ELIAS

(amused, jealous)

Having fun?

(neither answers; to

Hull)

I talked to Barbosa. He'll see us

now.

BARBOSA

Ten kilos? You're always late on

two.

HULL

Not ten... twenty.

HULL

(continuing)

The more we have, the more we can

move. There're markets we can't open

because we don't have the inventory.

BARBOSA

Finally some balls on this team...

(taunting Elias)

Come work for me, John. I'll give

you your own franchise. You can supply

Elias, lean on him when he's late.

ELIAS

Go fuck yourself.

HULL

I'm with David.

BARBOSA

Why? He give you his "designer drugs"

pitch. He's never going to do it.

He's a shmuck.

ELIAS

Don't talk to me that way.

BARBOSA

I'm not talking to you at all. I'm

talking to John.

GOPHER

It's the cocaine. Don't listen to

him. Felix, you've had enough...

BARBOSA

Shmuck.

GOPHER

Praise God they don't let guns in

here.

CALMING VOICES

"None of that in here..." "Take it

outside..."

BARBOSA

David, you've been working out, you're

getting strong. Are you quick, too?

(shadow boxes)

Come on, I'll give you a shot at me.

ELIAS

Any time, any place.

BARBOSA

Right here, right now. Do this.

ELIAS

This? What is this?

BARBOSA

You know, you slap me, I slap you.

(mimes that game)

Come on, it's fun. Like summer camp.

HULL

Don't waste your time.

BARBOSA

Stay out of this.

(to Elias)

Come on, you can do it, David, you're

not a shmuck.

BARBOSA

(continuing)

Slap my hands. Just slap them.

BARBOSA

(continuing)

Now it's my turn.

GOPHER

It's Barbosa's turn. He's gonna kill

the white boy.

ELIAS

One more.

BARBOSA

No, you went, Davey, now it's my

turn. First to four wins, like the

World Series.

GOPHER

Oh, God, I can't look.

BARBOSA

You remember the rules? If you flinch,

I get to hit you.

BARBOSA

(continuing)

Again, shmuck.

GOPHER

One.

ELIAS

That was two.

BARBOSA

No, this is two.

GOPHER

Oh, and it hurts. Mercy, it hurts.

GOPHER

(continuing)

Three.

A VOICE

Felix! No mas. Finito.

SOMEONE

Gallegos...

GOPHER

The fight is over! The Ambassador

from the South has spoken!

ELIAS

(refusing any mercy)

One more.

ELIAS

(continuing)

One more! We're not finished!

(people are silent)

Four was the match.

BARBOSA

Four.

HULL

Okay, that's it. Get away.

ELIAS

Look at me. Look at me, damn it!

HULL

Why did you do it?

ELIAS

I needed it. They taught me what I

needed to know. That I'm not part of

them, and I never will be. That they

don't respect me. That I don't deserve

respect. Because I'm a shmuck, John.

I'm a shmuck...

BARBOSA

David, I'm sorry. It's a crazy time,

and... you know... I'm doing a little

too much coca... I'll buy your kid a

pony... anything you want... Let's

forget about it.

GOPHER

I am so proud of you. You can be

cruel, and you can be kind. And just

now you were kind. Proud, proud, and

more proud. That's me.

BARBOSA

Shut up.

BARBOSA

I got nothing to give you, my man.

I'm an il-liquid son of a bitch.

HERNANDEZ

Felix, I keep telling them, "I have

informants down there, I'm working

guys, I can't say who..." If you

don't have money, give me busts, or

they're gonna start wondering about

me.

GOPHER

They're already wondering.

BARBOSA

(deadpan)

You can have Gopher.

GOPHER

Oh Gawd...

BARBOSA

How about a lawyer?

GOPHER

(knows who he means)

Felix, don't do this.

HERNANDEZ

(he knows, too)

Great, lawyers are great, Jewish is

best. But I need spades, too. The

politicians want dark facts to scare

the suburbs so they'll vote

Republican.

BARBOSA

Lawyers and spades; I got the

trifecta: two dealers and a girl who

does their wash. Two niggers and a

kike; all Democrats.

HERNANDEZ

You're my man. And afterwards...

BARBOSA

When this is over, I'll send you to

Hawaii, Maui. It's very beautiful in

Maui, it's a very spiritual place.

HERNANDEZ

I just want money.

GOPHER

I wouldn't trust that man when he's

out of rifle range.

GOPHER

(continuing;

premonition of

disaster)

Don't do this, Felix. It'll go wrong.

Kill Elias if you have to, honey,

but don't set him up for this. It

damages your prestige.

BARBOSA

David, you're awake, I'm impressed...

I'm sorry about what happened...

Listen, I'll get you twenty boxes,

like you wanted. You were right, you

should have what you need... Tomorrow

night... Bring your partner and that

girl with the store, Betty... I need

her advice on something. I want us

to have fun, like we used to. We'll

go to that shrimp place, okay?...

Good... Me, too, David.

(hangs up; does another

line; drawing it

deep into him)

Yes!

HULL

We're getting twenty kilograms

tomorrow.

(notes the lightening

sky)

Tonight. I made it happen. I pushed

Elias, now he doesn't make a move

without me.

CARVER

You run Elias.

HULL

I control him. Barbosa's selling it

to us because he thinks I can move

it...

(now the big news)

And last night I met Ramon Gallegos.

HULL

(continuing)

We're getting the dope from him;

it's still coming through Barbosa,

but Gallegos will approach me soon

on his own. We're going to get him,

Gerry. We're going to bring him and

the whole thing down.

HULL

(continuing)

What's your problem?

CARVER

(looking out window)

My problem? My problem is that you

don't really know what's happening.

HULL

(sardonic)

Oh, so, tell me what's happening,

Gerry.

CARVER

Barbosa is setting you up tonight.

HULL

Bullshit.

CARVER

He's dealing you to Taft and

Hernandez. You're going to be taken

down as you receive the drugs. They're

putting together the arrest team

right now.

HULL

What do we do?

CARVER

You stay away. We're going to take

them down.

HULL

Who? Elias and Betty? Don't be silly.

CARVER

My boss wants a bust right now. He

goes before the oversight committee

next week. He needs something to

justify the budget.

HULL

(imploring)

I'll get him something. Give me ten

days, and I'll get him Gallegos on a

plate.

CARVER

Too late. The whole thing's set up.

HULL

Gerry, what are you telling me? I

need Elias... and Betty. You arrest

them, and you're throwing away

everything I've set up.

CARVER

It's out of my hands.

CARVER

(continuing)

John, don't go near that bust.

HULL

We shouldn't go to them. Maybe them

come to us.

ELIAS

He wouldn't.

HERNANDEZ

(whispering into radio)

Here they are. Nobody move until we

see the green suitcase.

BARBOSA

(flirtatious)

I'm sorry for dragging you out so

late, but I have to be careful.

MCCUTCHEON

It gives me confidence.

HULL

Let's see what we've got.

HULL

(continuing; spotting

the police van in

the adjacent lot)

Don't touch it.

BARBOSA

What is this?

HULL

Something's wrong. What's that van

doing there?

HULL

(continuing)

This is a bust. The minute we take

the stuff, they'll be over us.

BARBOSA

He's crazy, David. I thought you

were the crazy one, but it's him.

HULL

Chino, pick up the suitcase and give

it to Elias. I'll only kill him if

something goes wrong.

BARBOSA

No!!

ELIAS

(softly)

Fucking A, John...

HULL

Okay, everybody in the car.

TAFT

We have a problem.

HERNANDEZ

Shit! Shit! Shit!

(aiming rifle; Hull

in sights)

Enough of this...

TAFT

No!

BARBOSA

(screaming at van)

Don't shoot... Don't shoot...

TAFT

Goddam it, what the hell are you

doing?

MCCUTCHEON

(weeping)

I asked for this... I asked for it...

It's my fault...

HULL

(calm, eyes on road)

Relax. We'll make it.

BARBOSA

He's a cop. He has to be. How else

would he have known?

HULL

If I was cop, you'd be face down

back there.

MCCUTCHEON

How did you know?

HULL

The whole thing smelled. Changing

his mind about the stuff. Meeting us

way out here. And I'd seen cops in

that van before. Hernandez is dirty,

that's who he's using.

ELIAS

(to Barbosa)

Get out of the car.

HULL

David, not now.

ELIAS

Yes, now!

TAFT

Who are you, man? Who the fuck are

you?

HERNANDEZ

(stonewalling)

I'm me.

ELIAS

He traded us to the cops. Just like

Eddie. Eddie, who was nice to my

daughter, had to die because that's

the rule. And you were vulgar about

my wife, Felix, so at the very least

the same rule applies to you.

BARBOSA

I'll give you money. I'll give you a

million. Anything you want.

ELIAS

I want you to get out of the car.

Get out of the fucking car. Out of

the fucking --

MCCUTCHEON

(near tears)

No, no... we can't do this.

HULL

(turning around from

front seat)

Stop it, David, or we're...

ELIAS

(in a fury)

Look at my hands!

ELIAS

(continuing; to

Barbosa, softly)

Get out of the car.

MCCUTCHEON

No!

HULL

Goddammit!

ELIAS

Stay out of this, or you'll die.

You'll both die. Everyone'll die.

BARBOSA

I can't...

ELIAS

I had him!

HULL

You want to kill a cop?? Don't be

stupid.

ELIAS

Everything is different. We're the

Colombians now.

(radiant)

This is the greatest night of my

life. Terrible but great. Felix was

right...

MCCUTCHEON

(appalled)

About what?

ELIAS

He said I should kill a man. He was

right.

MCCUTCHEON

My God.

ELIAS

Barbosa was a roach. Do you miss

him? Will anybody in the world miss

him?

MCCUTCHEON

Are you a roach, too?

ELIAS

(happily)

Yes. Thank God.

MCCUTCHEON

(to Hull)

What about you?

MCCUTCHEON

(continuing)

Stop the car.

MCCUTCHEON

(continuing)

Stop it!

MCCUTCHEON

(continuing)

No more laundering, no more anything.

I'm finished with this.

ELIAS

She knows too much. We have to kill

her.

HULL

No! She's with me. She's not going

to talk.

(looks at Elias)

You touch her, I'll kill you.

ELIAS

She's your responsibility then.

ELIAS

(continuing)

We're going to get the money now,

John. Enough for the new drug. We're

going to be rich. We're going to be

so rich that we're going to leave

the world of ordinary people and

going to a higher realm. I mean that.

HULL

They're going to come after us.

ELIAS

(matter-of-fact)

It's a hardball game. We're hardball

players.

HERNANDEZ

It wasn't my fault.

MOLTO

It never is.

MCCUTCHEON

Don't kill me. I'm not going to talk.

I swear. Please.

MCCUTCHEON

Don't look...

HULL

(softly)

Tell me about you.

MCCUTCHEON

(half-kidding)

Everything worth knowing you just

found you.

HULL

Don't hurt her.

ELIAS

Who's grave?

GALLEGOS

My wife's. She died of leukemia three

years ago.

(looks around)

I like to be among the dead. They

never interrupt you.

(turning to them)

Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny

fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee

businessman in Bogata hotels. He

grew up. He made himself strong and

rich, but getting there made him

sick, and that killed him. So he

lost everything for the same reason

he'd gotten it in the first place.

Now we'll see if you can do as well.

GALLEGOS

(continuing)

Felix owed me one million eight

hundred thousand dollars.

GALLEGOS

(continuing)

When you killed him, you bought the

debt; now you owe it to me; you get

to keep thirty percent, like he did.

You have three days.

HULL

Who did Barbosa collect from?

GALLEGOS

If you don't know, you shouldn't

have killed him.

GALLEGOS

(continuing)

Cute... Can I have that?

GOPHER

I don't want you in here. You killed

the man, and I loved him. I don't

want to have anything to do with

you.

GOPHER

(continuing; apoplectic)

I'm a sixty-three-year-old man! I'm

a grandfather! Would you hit a sixty-

three-year-old white man? Would you

hit your own grandfather?

ELIAS

(slaps him against

wall)

Listen, you fucking monkey, you know

who owed him money, and we know you

know. Tell us or --

HULL

He'll tell us. Gopher, just...

GOPHER

You can't tell anyone it was me.

HULL

Where the hell is all the money?

We're still a million short.

ELIAS

I gotta get laid.

HULL

David, we've got thirty-six hours.

ELIAS

(slams trunk, moves

toward door)

Pick me up at Jacqueline's in the

morning.

HULL

Sooner than that.

CARVER

(an order)

Get in.

HULL

(as he gets in)

What are you doing here? You're going

to get me killed.

CARVER

Where the hell have you been?

HULL

Doing my job.

CARVER

You violated a direct order to stay

away from that bust. As a result, a

police informant is dead, a state

senator was critically injured in

the tunnel pile up and a city

policeman was subsequently murdered.

HULL

I didn't blow my cover.

CARVER

Don't get smart with me, motherfucker.

HULL

Don't be a shmuck, Gerry. I'm talking

to Gallegos. I'm collecting his money.

We can set him up right now.

(NOTE: Carver arrives

somewhere and parks.

To be discussed, but

let's say, for now,

that we are:)

CARVER

Never have, never will.

(puts the flask away)

I want you to give me your gun. You're

coming in right now.

HULL

(doesn't understand)

Coming in where?

CARVER

Your assignment has been terminated.

You're not going out there again. If

I have to, I'll put you in custody.

HULL

(uncomprehending)

I'm going to have Gallegos in two

days.

HULL

(continuing)

You're protecting him. You're

protecting Gallegos.

HULL

(continuing)

No, of course. That's why you wanted

to bust Elias and Betty. I was getting

close, and you wanted to cut this

off then... What is he, the new

Noriega? Helps you fight commies, so

you let him sell drugs to the niggers.

Two birds with one stone.

CARVER

You violated orders, so you're

through. Don't make a conspiracy

theory out of it.

HULL

(laughs)

I'm through...? Then, I might as

well have a drink after all.

HULL

(continuing)

Now tell me the truth or they're

going to decide your troubles got

the best of you.

CARVER

You're insane.

HULL

All the more reason to do what I

say. Jesus, Ger, I'm having trouble

holding on...

CARVER

All right!

HULL

Say it!

CARVER

It's the State Department.

CARVER

(continuing)

I told you, Gallegos's uncle is a

big deal down there.

HULL

Guzman.

CARVER

Guzman, right. Our government supports

Guzman because he's a moderate. That's

a right-winger who's pro-U.S.

(he doesn't like it

either)

If Gallegos got busted here, it would

hurt Guzman's political career there.

It's politics, John, not drugs.

HULL

Drugs is politics. Politics is

drugs...

(sickened)

Christ, Gerry, I dealt drugs. I killed

a man. Others died. What did I do

all this for? For nothing.

CARVER

I'm going to Washington, John. I'll

bring you with me. We'll have clout,

money...

HULL

(outraged)

I didn't do this for clout or money.

You said we were gonna do some good.

CARVER

We tried.

HULL

Trying's for college boys.

(his head on fire)

If all there is is power and money...

If all there is... then what am I

doing here? 'Cause I can get more

power and money out on the street, I

got more there already, than I'd

ever get kissing your ass in

Washington...

CARVER

But you can't do that, John. It's

not you.

HULL

Me? There is no me. We took care of

that. First I was a cop pretending

to be a dealer. Now I'm just a dealer

pretending to be a cop. Why not stop

pretending...? Quit the force. Be a

dealer.

CARVER

It's not that simple.

HULL

My assignment's already terminated.

All I have to do is quit. I hereby

quit.

(lifts the flask)

My first one.

(drinks)

Not so bad.

CARVER

Don't blow your cover.

MCCUTCHEON

What's the matter?

HULL

Who are you, my mother?

MCCUTCHEON

Tell me.

HULL

Tell you what?

MCCUTCHEON

What you came to say.

HULL

What did I come to say?

MCCUTCHEON

Then tell me anything. Something

about you. Something real.

HULL

(long beat; another

drink)

When I was young, I occasionally

stole things.

(laughs to himself)

My father died when I was ten. Right

in front of me.

HULL

(continuing)

Heart attack. He just fell down. He

said, "I love you," then died in my

arms.

MCCUTCHEON

Oh, baby...

MCCUTCHEON

(continuing)

Tell me what's going on, John?

HULL

(doesn't want to talk

about that)

You're not doing the stuff anymore,

are you?

MCCUTCHEON

No. Don't change the subject.

HULL

How is that?

MCCUTCHEON

It's hard. John...!

HULL

(trying to tell without

telling)

Things are getting, they're getting

a little... confusing. I had certain

plans, and people haven't come through

exactly as they promised.

MCCUTCHEON

What do you expect with those people?

HULL

(laughs)

It's not just those people. It's...

it's bigger than that. It's of

everybody. Present company excluded.

MCCUTCHEON

You've got to stop this, John, you

know that. You gotta get out.

HULL

I can't.

MCCUTCHEON

Of course, you can.

HULL

(almost angry)

No! This is what I'm supposed to do.

MCCUTCHEON

Supposed to? Who said you're supposed

to?

HULL

The whole fuckin' world. You think I

didn't try something else? But

everything funnels you right back

here. Like it's where you had to go

all along.

MCCUTCHEON

But you know what you're doing, don't

you, selling this stuff? Doing to

our own.

HULL

If I tried to get out now, they'd

kill me.

MCCUTCHEON

(tortured)

I can't be with somebody's who

involved in drugs.

HULL

There've got to be more. We have a

million two, we owe Gallegos one

eight.

GOPHER

I told you everyone. Everyone who

owed him, everyone he... One eight?

He's lying. Barbosa barely owed him

a million.

TAFT

I got every money transfer, every

phone call, all your laundry tickets.

MCCUTCHEON

(miserable)

What do you want?

TAFT

John Hull.

MCCUTCHEON

I can't!

TAFT

Or you'll go away 'til you're a dried

up old woman, and when you come out,

ain't nobody gonna want you.

HULL

What are you laughing at?

HULL

It isn't one eight.

(off Gallegos)

It's a million one. That's all Barbosa

owed, it's all we're paying.

GALLEGOS

Big brass balls. Collecting money

makes you strong.

ELIAS

What's that?

GALLEGOS

I'm telling our suppliers they got

paid. They'll be very happy. I'm

happy.

ELIAS

And we're happy. Everybody's happy.

It's a happy world.

GALLEGOS

So, how can I express my gratitude

for a job well done?

ELIAS

We want Barbosa's business.

GALLEGOS

Done. Of course.

ELIAS

And, also, your business. All this.

Your money, your dope, everything.

GALLEGOS

(smiles)

You're tougher than I thought, but

not that tough.

ELIAS

How tough is enough?

HULL

No!

ELIAS

(breathless)

Thank you, John. I couldn't have

done that without you.

HULL

(barely able to speak)

Jesus Christ...

ELIAS

You taught me to take my work

seriously.

HULL

What's going on here, David?

ELIAS

We're taking over.

HULL

You're doing too much stuff.

ELIAS

No, I'm very clear. I'm very, very

clear.

(to Molto)

Ahora, usted nos assistamos. Enteindo?

ELIAS

(to Molto)

Donde esta?

HULL

What the fuck's the matter with you?

ELIAS

It works, John. It works.

HULL

Jesus...

ELIAS

(to Molto)

Disce a Senor Guzman que...

(his Spanish isn't

good enough)

...that we have his money, and we're

willing to talk as soon as he comes

to town. We'll know how to reach

him. Okay?

ELIAS

Approximating the cubic capacity and

depending on the denominations of

the bills, it's somewhere between

fifty million and two hundred million

dollars. Right back there.

ELIAS

(continuing; not

turning around)

Think I'm crazy?

HULL

Yes.

(blowing up, gun still

on him)

I can't believe you got us into this.

All of fucking Latin America is going

to be after our asses, including

Renaldo Guzman who's friends with

fucking George Bush.

ELIAS

I know they're coming after us. I

want them to. We'll give them the

money, but we'll make a deal for

ourselves. We'll get what we need

for the synthetic drugs. I've thought

it all out. I've been thinking it

out for years.

ELIAS

(continuing)

We're going to have everything. Don't

you want everything, John?

HULL

They're going to get your family,

David. They'll kill your wife and

daughter.

ELIAS

(serene)

Nancy and Miranda left the country

two days ago.

HULL

You knew about this then?

HULL

(continuing)

What about Betty?

MCCUTCHEON

Hi, my name is Betty.

EVERYONE IN THE ROOM

Hi, Betty!

MCCUTCHEON

My name is Betty, I'm a drug addict.

And I've been clean for nineteen

days.

MCCUTCHEON

(continuing)

I've been using drugs and selling

them, and I've wanted to stop for a

long time, and the only way I did

was because I met a man I loved and

who loved me. I know that's not what

I'm supposed to say. I'm supposed to

say there was a higher power, and

maybe there was, behind it all, but

this man is strong and his love made

me strong enough that I could start,

or at least think about a life that

didn't have drugs in it...

MCCUTCHEON

I've got to get clothes.

HULL

You can't go back.

BLONDE WOMAN

(nodding)

She got a fever and just burned up.

She just burned up all of a sudden.

It must have been bad stuff.

MCCUTCHEON

(indicating James)

He shouldn't be here.

BLONDE WOMAN

(takes his hand)

Come on, James, we'll go get a

burrito.

TAFT

Cute kids...

HULL

(angry at the invasion)

Give me that.

TAFT

Tell me something, who the fuck are

you?

TAFT

(continuing)

'Cause I don't think you're quite

the asshole you're trying to be.

HULL

Look, Mr. Taft, that's your name,

right? Leave me alone. I got things

on my mind.

TAFT

I'd think you would. You better have

your goddamn life on your mind, or

it's gonna get away from you. It's

gonna burn up like that poor woman

across the way. Like all of you's

gonna burn...

HULL

And what do you do, Mr. Taft, except

chase bad guys up and down the street

with your dirty partner, never

catching anybody important?

TAFT

I do what I can. Do you do what you

can?

(Hull says nothing)

Maybe my partner was dirty. Maybe

the chief's dirty. And the mayor.

And the President. Maybe God Himself's

taking something on the side. That's

their problem. But I'll bust 'em if

I can.

HULL

(without force)

Get out of my room.

TAFT

Don't deny who you are.

HULL

They're my children. They live in

Cleveland with their mother. I'm

divorced from her. I haven't seen

them in... some time. I want to, but

I haven't been able to arrange it.

MCCUTCHEON

How much else don't I know about

you?

HULL

(trying to make a

joke)

Everything else... Everything else

is... I don't know.

MCCUTCHEON

Taft has all the evidence about my

laundering.

MCCUTCHEON

He's going to put me in jail for a

long time unless I give you up.

HULL

Do it.

MCCUTCHEON

I can't. So, I've got to get away.

Far away. But I need money.

HULL

(laughs)

Money? I got money...

HULL

(to the driver)

International terminal.

(to Betty)

I'll meet you there in a week.

MCCUTCHEON

You know the first time, when I saw

you in the bar...?

HULL

(smiles at the memory)

You wouldn't even look at me.

MCCUTCHEON

'Cause I knew what you were thinking.

You were judging me.

HULL

No, I wasn't, I was...

MCCUTCHEON

You were. Your eyes were like an

angel in my heart telling me I should

be good, and I didn't want to hear

it.

MCCUTCHEON

(continuing)

That's you, too. Maybe this is you,

I don't know, but I know that's you.

HULL

What if we forget all this? Take ten

million each and disappear. Leave

the country. New identities, new

lives...

ELIAS

What's the matter, John? Having

doubts?

HULL

Yeah.

ELIAS

Yes... Where?... No! No way... We

pick the time and place... Otherwise

no meet...

(looks to Hull who

nods his agreement)

Got a pencil?

ELIAS

We have a proposal to make. We regret

what happened to your nephew...

GUZMAN

Say what you have to say.

ELIAS

We all know that your cousin's

business is coming to an end. Costs

have climbed while profits and the

market --

ELIAS

(continuing)

We have developed a new product:

simpler, cheaper to manufacture,

superior quality and completely

synthetic. Therefore, no growing, no

refining, no peasants, no importing,

no customs agents... Here's a detailed

prospectus with anticipated cash

flow and so forth.

GUZMAN

(to Molto, teasing

Elias)

The racist Americans just want to

cut us poor Hispanics out of the

market.

ELIAS

There are no Americans anymore, Mr.

Guzman, you know that. No Hispanics,

no Japanese, no blacks, no whites,

no anything. There are only rich

people and poor people. We're rich,

so we're on the same side.

TAFT

Do they have money in there?

GOPHER

I don't know.

TAFT

They wouldn't meet here otherwise.

TAFT

(continuing)

Okay, everybody, here's the play...

ELIAS

We're prepared to give you 80% of

the money. The remainder you invest

in our business with proceeds paid

out according to the figures there.

GUZMAN

This looks interesting. I'd have to

confirm everything, of course. Do

you have a sample of the product?

MOLTO

Buy it!

GUZMAN

Where is our money?

GUZMAN

(continuing; anger)

You set this up.

HULL

They're after us, not you.

TAFT

(screaming)

Where are the rest of them?

ELIAS

We did it. Twenty million. Twenty

fucking million. We're going to have

synthetics. We're gonna be rich.

We're gonna...

ELIAS

(continuing)

What's the matter, John? Be happy.

Your whole life has just been solved.

VOICE

(behind them)

Stop! Police!

ELIAS

(heading the other

way)

John, where are you going?

HULL

Oh, Jesus, no...

ELIAS

John, what the hell are you doing?

Let's get out of here.

HULL

(distraught)

He's dying.

ELIAS

Let him die. Let him die twice. Come

one.

HULL

[Says to Taft whatever a CPR-trained

policeman would say in this

situation.]

(to Elias)

Get help.

ELIAS

Are you kidding me?

TAFT

(to Hull, getting it)

Oh, man, you're a cop. You're a cop,

aren't you?

HULL

(with difficulty, as

if against his will)

Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a fucking cop...

ELIAS

(laughs)

Oh, really? Where's you badge?

HULL

I don't have one. I'm undercover.

Get help, David.

ELIAS

John, that's a cop. He tried to kill

you.

HULL

He didn't know.

ELIAS

Oh, he didn't know. I don't know.

Maybe you don't know. Maybe you think

you're a cop because... because...

HULL

Drop the gun, put your hands against

the car. Spread your legs... Police!

HULL

(continuing)

My God! Please...

ELIAS

Okay, let's say you're a cop. Be a

cop.

ELIAS

(continuing)

We've still got the money. We put it

into Randy's chemistry set. In five

years we're worth five hundred million

each, minimum. You'll be one of the

richest black men in America. Richer

than Cosby. Who gives a shit how you

got it? You think the white ones

were honest?

ELIAS

(continuing)

Is this asshole all that stands

between you and greatness? Let me do

you a favor.

ELIAS

(continuing)

Gee, John, that's kind of an extreme

reaction.

POLICEMAN

Fucking nigger...

HULL

What about Guzman?

CARVER

He vanished, thank God, or we'd both

be in deep doo-doo. At least you got

Gallegos.

HULL

Elias did. And everything goes on as

before.

CARVER

That's the drug game. Plus a change...

I want you to come back to work for

me. You'll beat all charges on a

technicality and go back to who you

were.

HULL

Who was I, Ger?

CARVER

Does anyone really know?

HULL

I have other things to do.

CARVER

Like travel? Tangiers, maybe?

CARVER

(continuing)

I'm God, remember?

CARVER

Go back to work, she walks out of

here. Otherwise, she's up on multiple

counts, and I'll see to it the judge

runs them consecutively.

MCCUTCHEON

They want me to testify against you.

I said I wouldn't.

HULL

You have to. It's all set up. That's

how you're getting off.

HULL

(continuing; with

difficulty)

My father didn't have a heart attack.

HULL

(continuing)

He was shot robbing a liquor store.

Trying to rob it. I lied about that.

MCCUTCHEON

Baby, why are you telling me this?

HULL

I had to start somewhere... There're

other things you don't know...

CARVER

Betty walked out of court free this

morning. That's my side of the deal.

HULL

(to the children)

You two run on ahead.

CARVER

Her probation gets revoked the minute

you fuck up. I want you to stay away

from her altogether.

HULL

You know the difference between a

black man and a nigger?

HULL

(continuing)

The nigger's the one who'd even think

about doing what you tell him.

CARVER

Don't blow your cover.

THE END
