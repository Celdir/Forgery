WILSON

Edward Rama?

ED

Eduardo.

(rolling the R)

Rama.

WILSON

You're home, then.

WILSON

My name's Wilson.

ED

Wilson?

WILSON

You wrote to me about my daughter.

CUT.

INT. ED'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.

ED

I didn't expect anyone.

WILSON

No reason.

ED

I mean, what has it been -- six months?

WILSON

Round about, yeah.

ED

I didn't even know who I was writing to --

just someone with the same last name.

She never talked about any family.

WILSON

It was better than a telegram.

EXT. ED'S BACKYARD.  NIGHT.

WILSON

Who done it, then?

ED

Huh?

WILSON

Snuffed her.

ED

Now, wait up a second, man.

ED

I never said nothin' about nothin' like

that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I

wrote to you.

WILSON

No, but between the lines, eh?

Mysterious circumstances, and that.

ED

Look, I sent you that newspaper clipping,

all right?  I told you what I know.  It

was an accident.  I didn't say anything

about anybody being "snuffed."

WILSON

This bloke she was bunked up with.  This

Terry what'sit.

ED

Terry Valentine.

WILSON

Valentine.  What's he got to say for

himself?

ED

I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had

a fight that night, she drove away, she

was upset?  I don't even know the guy.

Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were

friends, but we didn't travel in the same

social circles.  She had her life, I had

mine.

ED

Valentine came into the restaurant where

I work with Jenny a couple times.  He's a

money guy.  Jenny would say, hey, here's

my friend Eddie and he would shake my

hand and everything, but he wouldn't even

see me, you know what I mean.

WILSON

How long had she been in the States?

(as if to himself, somewhat

wistful)

Near on ten years, wasn't it?  Long

enough to know her way about, I reckon.

ED

There was an investigation, okay?  The

car was totalled.  Jennifer was ... Her

neck was broken.  On impact, they said.

So she wouldn't have ... felt the effects

of the fire.

(helpless shrug)

It happens up there.  Happens a lot.

What more can I tell you.

WILSON

What more is there.

ED

I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep

hillside.  There was no moon that

night ...

ED

Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never

knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure,

she would smoke a little grass, or

something, have a few drinks.  But that's

it, nothing more than that.

WILSON

No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had.

Point of pride.

(smokes)

And people don't change, do they.

ED

I dunno ... Maybe they do.

WILSON

Going straight, are ya.

ED

(looks away)

Boomerang.

WILSON

Y'what?

ED

I knew when I was droppin' that letter

into the mail slot it was gonna come back

and smack me in the face.

(looks at Wilson again)

I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol'

man's up in Chino right now doin' eight

years.

WILSON

(re the family inside)

This ain't your lot?

ED

You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife

and screamin' kids.  I still got my

youth.

ED

I go to work, try to keep my life

together, put all that shit behind me,

man.  What d'you want from me.

WILSON

(calmly smoking)

I only asked.

ED

Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer

asked me to drive her downtown.  Said she

was meeting -- her boyfriend --

Valentine.  But I think she was looking

for him.

FLASH CUTS:

WILSON

(lighting Ed's cigarette)

What, tryin' to catch him with another

bird?

ED

That's what I thought, man.  But it was

not a hotel or nothin' that we went to.

It was someplace else.

WILSON

Where abouts?

FLASH CUTS:

ED

Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys

loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal

goin' down.

(anticipating Wilson's next

question)

I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe

they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.

WILSON

Did Jenny know?

ED

(shrugs)

Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was

into something, if she was involved --

who can say.

(stands up again)

But I'll tell you something.  She stood

in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing

them

.  Checking

them

out.

(beat)

I felt like she was covering

my

ass that

day.

ED

I drove her back to Valentine's house.

FLASH CUT:

ED

He was standing outside waiting for her.

That's the only other time I ever saw

him.

(a short sad note)

Last time I saw her.

CUT.

INT. ED'S CAR.  NIGHT.

ED

What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to

the cops?

WILSON

Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.

ED

Those streets up in the hills, man.

Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on

the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning,

it's dark, your mind is all agitated,

you're drivin' a little too fast ...

(beat)

Those curves don't kid around.

ED

You should talk to Elaine.  That was her

best friend.

WILSON

She didn't write to me, did she.

ED

She didn't know what to say.

(shrugs)

I thought someone should say something.

To someone.  With me it was, I don't know

-- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I

felt like I owed her.

WILSON

Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass

or whatever?

ED

(self-conscious again)

Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what

you think.

WILSON

(re Ed's tattoos)

I think you didn't get that lot in the

Navy, doing your National Service.

ED

I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know

what that is?  State prison.

WILSON

Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what

state you're in.  State of remorse, most

likely -- for gettin' caught.

ED

But that's not me anymore.  That's when I

was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not

who I am now.  Five years in the joint --

that's it for me, man.

WILSON

Just got out meself, didn't I.

CUT.

EXT. WILSON'S MOTEL.  NIGHT.

ED

Go home, man.

(plane taking off in

background)

Get on a plane.

WILSON

I'll be needing a shooter.

ED

(comes quickly over)

You're kiddin' me, right?

WILSON

What do I do, then, look in the bleedin'

Yellow Pages?

ED

(an urgent whisper)

These are not guys you can just go run a

number on, man.

WILSON

(looking around)

Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing

machines, you know.  Bung in your coins,

come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.

ED

Are you a resident of California?

You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the

background check?  Go through a three-day

waiting period?

WILSON

Sod that.  Gotta get back before my

probation officer wonders where I've

skived off to.

ED

Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They

shouldn't've let you outta your country,

much less prison.

WILSON

Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.

WILSON

Which is why I thought, save some time,

get what I need under the table, like.

ED

Under the table?

CUT.

INT. GUN SHOW.  DAY.

PA SYSTEM

Attention:  the long-range vermin-

shooting panel is due to commence in two

minutes in the blue room at the rear of

the Convention Center.

BEAM SALESMAN

BeamSight II is easily mountable on any

shotgun, rifle, or sidearm and will

project a small, bright red dot directly

onto the point where your weapon is

aimed ...

DEALER

Man knows what he likes.

ED

(he'll talk if Wilson won't)

Lookin' good.

DEALER

(while Wilson checks)

That's a high-end item.  Total

reliability.

ED

What'd you call that -- the Protector?

DEALER

Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the

market.

ED

CQ what?

DEALER

Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my

own home.

WILSON

Trouble is, I'm not at home, see.

Fancied a bit of target shooting, y'know,

while I'm here -- with me mate.

DEALER

Oh really?  Where you from?

WILSON

England.

(sighting the weapon)

Only, we saw there was a show on, thought

I might pick something up for a price,

type of thing.

DEALER

You came to the right place, sir.  My

wife's second cousin is English.  Well,

Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a

holster?

WILSON

Just luck, this, really.  Never been to

one of these before.

DEALER

You're in gun country now, my friend.

WILSON

(picks up another, checks it

out)

Been to the Boat Show.

DEALER

(re Wilson's new selection)

Packs a punch, but it's compact, has

accessible features -- makes a nice

concealed-carry piece.

ED

(playing the reluctant buyer)

He don't have a concealed weapons permit.

WILSON

Don't have time for a lot of paperwork,

y'know.  Just popped over on a quick

visit.

DEALER

I can take care of the paperwork.

WILSON

Yeah?

DEALER

No problem.  If

you

don't have a problem

with me reporting this gun stolen.

WILSON

No.  Not at all.

(to Ed)

Do we?

ED

Not me, man.

WILSON

I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what

you said -- four hundred for this one?

DEALERS

Well, I'll have to add another two

hundred on top of that.

WILSON

Oh, aye?

DEALER

(another look)

... for the paperwork.

CUT.

INT. ED'S CAR.  DAY.

WILSON

Violation of my parole, this.

(a perfect pause)

-- Goin' abroad.

ED

You hadda show up on a weekend.  This

weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun

show ... for another month.

WILSON

Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be

allowed.

ED

Now what.  You gonna take your new

arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just

like that?  Boom bam boom.

WILSON

It's only insurance.  Can't be too

careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's

probably a wonderful fella.  They were

together how long?

ED

Five years, I think.  Long time.

WILSON

Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked

him.

ED

(remembering)

Jenny told me she met him at the beach.

Got blinded by his smile.

(beat)

You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch

never smiled at me.  Buried her at a

"private" service.  Private for who.

Him?

WILSON

(confused)

Hang about.  I thought you said he come

into the restaurant where you worked with

Jenny.

ED

He came in with Jenny to the restaurant

where I work.  That's not where they met.

WILSON

And that's where you met Jenny.

ED

No, no -- Jenny used to work as a

waitress.  Before she met him.  But

that's not where she met me.  Not in my

restaurant.

WILSON

How'd the two of you hook up, then?

ED

Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.

CUT.

SUPERVISOR

Hey!

SUPERVISOR

How'd you get in here.

WILSON

Walked.

SUPERVISOR

You walked.

(coming over)

What the hell are you doing here.

WILSON

Looking for a bloke named Valentine.

Know him?

SUPERVISOR

He's expecting you?

WILSON

(beat)

I doubt it.

SUPERVISOR

So why would he want to see you.

WILSON

I have a message for him.  About Jennifer

Wilson.

SUPERVISOR

Jennifer Wilson.

WILSON

You know her?

SUPERVISOR

Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came

down here once, stirred up a shitstorm.

We lost a full day's work, took me weeks

to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't

a' been Terry's woman I would've broke

her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem

now.

WILSON

Is Valentine here?

SUPERVISOR

What do you think?

WILSON

Where is he, then?

SUPERVISOR

Listen, get the fuck out of here before

you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think

you are, waltzing in here, asking

questions?

SUPERVISOR

Do you hear me, asshole?

SUPERVISOR

Jesus, you really want your ass kicked,

don't you?

SUPERVISOR

Go on, get outta here.

SUPERVISOR

Fuckin' nut.  Go on.

CUT.

EXT. BUILDING.  DAY.

WILSON

You tell him.  You tell him I'm coming!!

CUT.

INT./EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DUSK.

VALENTINE

(into phone)

Not before.  Not

before

.  Think about it.

What does it mean?  What -- no, I'm not.

Think.  Yes.  See?  You figured it out

all by yourself.  I know.  Are we done?

Okay.

VALENTINE

Adhara.  I told your father, if you're

looking for a name, you can't go wrong

with a constellation.

ADHARA

I used to hate it.  Now I like it.

VALENTINE

Could be worse, he could've named you

Reticulum.

VALENTINE

Is there anything in the world that you

want or need?

ADHARA

I

want

to know why you

need

that scary

guy in your house.

VALENTINE

Gordon?  He's been with me for years.

He's not as tough as he looks.

ADHARA

Then what good is he?

VALENTINE

Is it possible that you're too young to

be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?

ADHARA

Is that a problem?

VALENTINE

Not for you, clearly.

ADHARA

I'm loyal to things that make me happy.

VALENTINE

Am I a thing?

ADHARA

Well, you're certainly not a person.

VALENTINE

I'm not.

ADHARA

No.  You're not specific enough to be a

person.  You're more like a vibe.

VALENTINE

I'm so glad we're having this chat.

ADHARA

It's not a knock.

VALENTINE

It's not a compliment.

ADHARA

It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry.

When are we eating?

VALENTINE

As soon as you get dressed.

ADHARA

What kind of food?

VALENTINE

Anything but Japanese.

ADHARA

Why?

VALENTINE

I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.

ADHARA

Like you.

VALENTINE

I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine.

Buffets.  Salad bars.

ADHARA

You demand to be served.  A fork

fetishist.

VALENTINE

It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for

distractions.

ADHARA

For some, eating is a sensual experience.

The

sensual experience.

VALENTINE

That's what Gordon's always saying.

ADHARA

Oh, god.

VALENTINE

(into phone)

Yes.

VALENTINE

(into phone)

I'll be there as soon as I can.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

We can leave as soon as you're ready.

ADHARA

Okay.

EXT. BALCONY.  EVENING.

VALENTINE

What.

AVERY

There's been some trouble downtown.

VALENTINE

What kind?

AVERY

What the papers used to call a "gangland

slaying."

VALENTINE

Our black friends?

AVERY

No, Terry.  They don't work like that.

Jenny Wilson's father paid a little

visit, left a message.

VALENTINE

I thought he was in prison, in England.

AVERY

Well, either they have a very liberal

work-release program, or he's out,

because he's here in L.A., looking for

you.

VALENTINE

What do we do?

AVERY

We wait, and we watch.

EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  POOLSIDE.  EVENING.

ADHARA

Italian?

VALENTINE

I'm sorry.

ADHARA

Italian.

VALENTINE

Who?

ADHARA

Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.

VALENTINE

Sure.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

Yes.  Are you ready?

ADHARA

As long as I don't have to pass Gordon

again.  I'm never ready for that.

VALENTINE

No.  I know another way out.

CUT.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING.  EVENING.

ELAINE

You're Jenny's father.

WILSON

Had a feeling it was you.

ELAINE

You look alike.

WILSON

(cigarette in hand)

Perhaps it was the smoke.

ELAINE

Not her brand.

WILSON

She used to pinch 'em off me.

(trying to defuse Elaine's cold

stare)

Funny that.  One thing she never tried to

get me to stop.

ELAINE

Why did you come here?

WILSON

Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?

ELAINE

No, why did you come here?

WILSON

Sort a few things out.

ELAINE

Been busy, have you.

WILSON

How d'you mean?

ELAINE

It's been a while.

WILSON

I was skint -- didn't have no money to

get here.

ELAINE

That's not what I heard.

WILSON

What was that, then?

ELAINE

I heard you were -- what's that adorable

phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."

WILSON

It was the bars, then.

ELAINE

In any case, I don't suppose the salary

you make sewing mailbags is really

commensurate with international airline

travel.

WILSON

Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an

honest day's work in my life, dear.

Wasn't about to start when I was in stir --

not with all that leisure time on my

hands.

ELAINE

And not with all that buried loot you had

waiting for you when you got out.  From

the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink

Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've

been ... fourteen at the time?

WILSON

(trying to conceal his

surprise)

Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love.

Earning interest in an offshore account.

Tidy little premium per annum, that.

ELAINE

Well, that kind of security can't be

bought.  Must be more comforting than a

daughter to greet you.

WILSON

Here, aren't you gonna let me in.

ELAINE

(without looking back)

Try calling me again.

INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT.  EVENING.

EXT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT BUILDING.  EVENING.

INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT.  EVENING.

ELAINE

I was just going to toss some vegetable

rolls in the microwave, open a can of

diet soda.

(beat)

Want to take me out?

CUT.

INT. RESTAURANT.  NIGHT.

WILSON

... No, I went in for more improving

pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language

courses, European history, all that lark.

Did you know that in Paris in the

Eighteenth Century there were more rats

in people's houses than there were people

in people's houses.

ELAINE

Sounds like Beverly Hills.

WILSON

Here, are you always this sarky?

ELAINE

Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when

my ship comes in.  It's expected any day

now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.

WILSON

Weren't you on a television series?

ELAINE

(has he seen it?)

If it played in England somebody owes me

money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?

WILSON

(yes)

Said it went on for donkey's years.

ELAINE

Three seasons.  They found that's the

limit of human tolerance when it comes to

following the adventures of a family of

Mormons on the Chisum Trail.

(blinks coquettishly)

I was wife number three -- the ingenue.

WILSON

Oh, it just ended, then.

ELAINE

Now who's being sarcastic?

WILSON

When you've lost as many years as I have,

love, puts things in perspective, know

what I mean.

ELAINE

I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have

no excuse for wondering where the time

went.

(raises her drink)

It must've been the bars.

ELAINE

It's a kind of prison, doing a series.

Early to bed, early to rise, no time off

for good behavior, you grab the boodle

for as long as it lasts.

(the kicker)

Only difference is you can't get arrested

afterwards.

WILSON

I can't believe Jenny told you all that.

About me.  She was always so embarrassed.

ELAINE

Not embarrassed.

WILSON

(correcting)

Ashamed.

ELAINE

Not ashamed.

ELAINE

Disappointed.

WILSON

She never told Eddie, though.

ELAINE

She never told anyone else.

(making light now)

About the convict strain -- or is it

stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was

someone who helped Jenny efface her past.

WILSON

How'd you manage that, then.

ELAINE

When I'm not honing my craft in episodic

television I do double-duty as a voice

coach.  Not that her accent would have

hobbled her progress.  Not with that

look.

WILSON

Yeah, well, she started all that in

London.

ELAINE

Modelling.

WILSON

Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.

(putting it on a bit there.

Then, upper crust:)

Central School of Speech and Drama.

It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know.

At seventeen.  They offered her a place

at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait

till the next session and she was always

in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could

talk posh without any training, when she

was knee-high to a grasshopper.

(indicating himself)

Show up the old man, you know.

ELAINE

You weren't disappointed in her, then.

WILSON

In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be.

'Course I wasn't.

ELAINE

She was twenty-one when she came to me.

(looks at him)

... Straight from leaving you.

WILSON

Footloose and fancy free.

ELAINE

She was happy here.  However the two of

you might have parted.  Don't think she

wasn't.

WILSON

That's the trouble, n' it.

(hard as nails again)

She enjoyed life.

CUT.

EXT. OCEANFRONT.  NIGHT.

ELAINE

When did you get in?

WILSON

Yesterday.  Afternoon.

ELAINE

(occurs to her)

You haven't been lurking outside my

building all day.

WILSON

No, I had -- some other matters to attend

to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...

ELAINE

I might've been away for the weekend.

WILSON

Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you

were goin' out, you'd probably have to

come home first.

ELAINE

And you've seen Eddie Rama.

WILSON

Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are

muckers.

ELAINE

I should really give him a call.  He's a

character, isn't he.  Well, not to you.

I meant to us squares in the outside

world.

WILSON

He give me your address.

ELAINE

I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want

to write, I think this is a relative.  I

guess I thought I was being true to

Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a

father -- before proceeding of course to

tell me why.

WILSON

Well, don't suppose she did, really, most

of her life.  On her own after her mum

died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and

then the bright lights beckoned.

ELAINE

Were you still married at the time -- to

Jenny's mother, I mean?

WILSON

Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her

second husband done a runner after she

got sick.  They give me compassionate

leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in

hospital.  We were always mates, me and

Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're

together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly

choir.

ELAINE

The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a

prison, was it?

WILSON

Nah, accommodation address.

ELAINE

What's that, like a P.O. box.

WILSON

Something like that, yeah.

ELAINE

Where you get your bank statements.

WILSON

Well, you gotta have something permanent,

don'tcha.  Even if it's a hole in the

wall.  No matter which jug I might be

transferred to, I always got someone on

the out checks up on it for me, see.

Anything I need to know, comes round on

visitor's day -- word in my ear.

ELAINE

Some word.

WILSON

I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When

was it supposed to have happened? -- two

o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.

ELAINE

(watching him)

That's what was estimated.

WILSON

Eight hours difference between here and

London.  Would've been, what, ten in the

morning, my time.  I was just coming out

on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of

saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of

fresh air, stretch me legs -- well,

stretch the day out, really, that's what

you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I

couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry

the pages apart -- it was like they was

glued together.  That's how weak my hands

went.  Thought I was having heart attack,

only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to

me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone

all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in

prison half my life, what d'ya expect.

But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel

the blood drain right out of me head.

And I knew ...

(beat)

Something had happened to Jen.

CUT.

INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

ELAINE

Make yourself at home.  Steal something.

ELAINE

There's nothing I can't afford to lose.

ELAINE

Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?

WILSON

Well, I gathered something from the

article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of

pop music producer, wasn't it.

ELAINE

Rock n' roll, is what we called it.  He's

sort of a forgotten figure now, but back

when the West Coast was the grooviest

place on earth, Terry Valentine was where

all the happenings happened.  More of a

kind of promoter, I guess, whatever that

means.  Just took that whole Southern

California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with

it.  Packaged and sold it.  Made out like

a bandit.

FLASH CUTS:

WILSON

What's he done lately.

ELAINE

(brings a tray over)

Lives high off the hog and waits for the

next big thing.  Like me -- but on a

grander scale of failure.

WILSON

Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My

employer, Mr. Lindgren --

ELAINE

-- Your employer?

WILSON

-- Mr. Lindgren.

ELAINE

Who's Mr. Lindgren?

WILSON

My employer.

ELAINE

What line is he in.

WILSON

Proprietor of a London firm.  Of

longstanding.

ELAINE

I see.

WILSON

Based in London, but with international

concerns.

ELAINE

I bet.

Various enterprises, style of thing.

ELAINE

I thought you said you never did an

honest day's work in your life.

WILSON

Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is

dishonest, exactly.

ELAINE

(she gets the picture)

Right.

WILSON

Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave,

never run yourself down, son -- 'cause

there'll always be plenty of people

willing to do it for you.

ELAINE

In what capacity are you employed by this

Mr. Lindgren?

WILSON

This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.

ELAINE

-- When he wants someone run down, you're

willing to do it for him.

ELAINE

So what's the deal.  You and Terry

Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what

this is about.

WILSON

Why not.

ELAINE

Are you serious.

WILSON

Have you ever known me not to be.

ELAINE

You fuckin' guys and your dicks.

WILSON

What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home,

twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A.

[Fuck All].

ELAINE

You don't believe it was a car accident.

WILSON

What do you think.

ELAINE

Terry's never going to give you

satisfaction.  Not the type.

WILSON

Depends, don' it.

ELAINE

On what.  What makes you so certain.

WILSON

I'll bloody well ask him.

ELAINE

There's the phone.  You want his number.

Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the

Who'd you butcher at the house?

WILSON

Butcher's hook.  Look.

(doesn't anyone speak English

in this fucking country?)

I don't much reckon those minders of his.

ED

Huh?

WILSON

He's brought in the heavy mob.

ED

What?

WILSON

Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.

ED

Has he?

WILSON

They look a right load of wallies.

Patrolling back and forth outside the

VALENTINE

We all did.

ADHARA

It must've been a time.  A golden moment.

VALENTINE

Have you ever dreamed of a place ... you

don't really recall ever having been

to ... a place that probably doesn't even

exist except in your imagination ...

somewhere far away, half-remembered when

you wake up ... but when you were there you

spoke the language, you knew your way

around ...

I could swear I met you with Ian at the

EMI offices in London.

WILSON

Sorry.  Wasn't me.

GUY

You sure?

WILSON

Unless I'm not who I think I am.

GUY

That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing

going over there.

WILSON

Yeah?

GUY

Turned that place completely around.  180

degrees.

WILSON

No kidding.

GUY

What I like about Ian, he believes in a

chain of command, but not a chain of

respect, you understand what I'm saying?

WILSON

Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good,

that.

GUY

Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well.

Good to meet you.

WILSON

Yeah.  Cheers, mate.

You could see the sea from here if you

WILSON

Why don't you go nick one of those little

cocktail and meet me in the garage.  Look

about for a toolbox while you're at it.

ED

Okay.

VALENTINE

Hi.  Terry Valentine.

WILSON

Pleasure.

VALENTINE

Have we met?  There's something I can't

quite --

WILSON

EMI in London.  I work with Ian.

VALENTINE

Ah.

WILSON

You must know Ian.

VALENTINE

I don't.

WILSON

Great bloke.  Really turned things around

there.  180 degrees.

VALENTINE

I suppose that's good, unless things were

fine the way they were.

WILSON

Oh, I think a shake-up was in order.

Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy,

don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking

they can get away with things.  Gotta

shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay

attention.

You should have let me do the talking.

Why, because you're my security

(insecure)

This cocksucker nearly burnt my house

down.

AVERY

(more concerned about police

presence)

What did you tell them.

VALENTINE

I told them a long-time employee flipped

out.  Had a drug problem, refused

counselling.  Set the garage on fire,

then committed suicide.  One of my

"guests" tried to stop him --

but how do

you stop Gordon

.

VALENTINE

I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four

hundred pounds.

AVERY

Heavier than that now.  But are there any

drugs in that stomach to back up your

story.

VALENTINE

As it happens.  I didn't make that part

up.

AVERY

And where is this guest?  Don't they want

to interview him.

VALENTINE

I don't know everyone here.  He was so

traumatized he split.

(another notion)

Maybe he was Gordon's

pusher

.

VALENTINE

Where do

you

think he is, Mike.

AVERY

(already turning)

We'll find him.

VALENTINE

(stops him)

No.  I mean.  Not even your people should

be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.

AVERY

You could use a few of my prime

shitkickers up here.

How'd you like to kill someone for me?

STACY

Okay.

AVERY

Same as last time -- the rest after.

STACY

(pockets it)

Where do we go?

AVERY

When you find the guy, you'll know.

STACY

What shit is this.  I just do it.  I

don't prepare it.

AVERY

I'll point you in the right direction,

but you'll have to take it to the end-

zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I

figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.

STACY

This is un-fucking professional.

AVERY

See, a successful man like me has

limitations -- I lose touch at a street

level.  So I have to depend on a smart

boy like you who's closer to the nitty

and the gritty than I am.

STACY

Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is.

This is a lifestyle I embrace.

That's why I'm letting you take care of

Study the architecture of early David

Lynch.

ELAINE

Jenny was supposed to come to my place

that night.  She called me, asked if she

could come over.  She and Terry had been

-- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't

know about what.  On this occasion, it

reached some sort of crisis point.

WILSON

She told you all about my details but not

about his.  Lovely.

ELAINE

She'd never called me like that before.

She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry --

than upset or afraid.  But she never

turned up.  I called the house but only

got the answer machine.  When they found

her ... she'd been going the wrong way.

Not the direction she'd have gone if

she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming

straight

to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she

just wanted to drive.

WILSON

(measured)

How did you come to have my address?

Found it, did you.  Among her things.

ELAINE

You think Terry gave me access to her

things?  Probably sold her clothes.

WILSON

(gently urging)

And how did you get it?

ELAINE

She

gave me your address.

ELAINE (cont'd)

(starting to realize)

Not long before ...

She said if anything ever happened ...

That's how you know.  That's why you're

INT. WILSON'S ROOM.

WILSON

How long've you lived here?

ELAINE

This town's been chewing my flesh

since ... what we now refer to as "the

early 70's."

(thinks back)

Christ, my past became nostalgia and no

one even asked me.

WILSON

Early 70's.  I was away.

(tries to remember)

Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.

ELAINE

These more highlights from the Zagat

prison guide?

WILSON

You don't seem bothered.

ELAINE

You don't know how I've compromised my

standards.

WILSON

Tell us about it.

ELAINE

It's too involved; a lifetime of non-

involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an

interesting little number, here I'm just

SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.

(quickly)

SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.

WILSON

Oh, I was gonna say ...

ELAINE

Still, there have been rewards.  It's

sunny.  And some of the producers who

call even have credits.

WILSON

I can see the attraction.

ELAINE

What did you do?  To make them take the

early 70's away from you.

WILSON

A jeweller's up the West End.  We

tunnelled our way under the shop floor

from the public lavatory down the road.

Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody

thing collapsed --

after

we'd made the

grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.

ELAINE

You mean if they'd nabbed you before you

actually broke and entered you would only

have been charged with making a mess.

WILSON

We were

lucky

to be nicked.  Me and the

lads went down there Sunday evening, we

weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good

job we were still breathing.

ELAINE

It didn't discourage you, though.

WILSON

Hey?

ELAINE

From pursuing your chosen profession.

WILSON

I'll tell ya something:  it made me a

model prisoner.  Put me right off any

escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to

freedom after that experience?  Not

bloody likely.

ELAINE

I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a

demo.

WILSON

Did you.  What was that in aid of?

ELAINE

Who remembers.

WILSON

Get seven years, did you?

ELAINE

Overnight.  What about just now?

WILSON

Just now?

(playful, goes over, ready for

more)

Overnight?

ELAINE

You

have

been away.

(lies back, regards him

carefully)

Or is all this just new to you?

WILSON

It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to

a slow start.

ELAINE

I don't believe it.

WILSON

Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I

was 21.

ELAINE

Pushing the legal limit even then.

WILSON

Me mate introduced me to a woman up the

street.  Funnily enough, she was married

to a milkman.  Straight up.  I said,

"Good is she?  Been around?"  He said,

"

Good

?  Listen, mush, it's not that she's

been around, it's that she's been around

hell of a long time."

ELAINE

that for?

It was for nine years.

ADHARA

Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on

ADHARA

Just feels like the car behind has been

VALENTINE

I sure hope so.

TOM

All I'm sayin' is travel time shouldn't

be the same rate.  Travel time is down

time, right?  I mean, we're not even in

the same car as the client.

(to Avery)

You told me the job was at the house.

When we get to it.  Well, are we shadowing

the client right now or are we just going

the same way?  The company I was with in

Seattle, these distinctions were made.

Now, I don't dispute

him

getting the full

whack.

(he means Rick, who's older)

Seniority and all that.  But if I'm

getting paid the same hourly rate when

we're at the

house

as I am in this car,

that doesn't sit well with me and I feel

obliged to say so.  'Cause in Seattle

what you're paying

now

for so-called

travel time was half what we got for

actual clock-time with the client.  So I

just feel we should get more when the job

actually

commences

"Homeless" people.  Fuck them.  Remember

Look at that one.  She's really been

I'd love to be famous so I could snub

ordinary people.  Imagine, you're famous,

you're sitting in a restaurant, some fool

comes up to you, wants you to sign your

in increments.

ELAINE

She told me you were a ghost in her life.

Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to

Royal Marines or doing scientific

research in the jungles of Borneo or

Still, you could never ... do what she

She used to tell me she'd turn me in.

didn't want me sent down again, see.

'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look,

I'm calling the Old Bill right now" --

picking up the telephone.  I can see her,

She never would have turned you in, not

in a million years.

him.  He was sitting on a bench in

Holland Park.  There was no one else

about.  I coulda gone up behind him and

snapped his fucking neck.  But I left it.

Coulda nobbled him, but I didn't.  'Cos

what I thought I wanted wasn't what I

wanted.  What I thought I was thinking

about was something else.  This berk on

the bench wasn't worth my time.  See what

I mean?  It didn't matter.  It meant sod

Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I

can see that, I'm on your manor now,

right.  So there's no need to get out of

your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all

this.  Whatever the bollocks between you

and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing

to do with me.  I don't wanna know.

FEATHER

Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this

Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of

money.

WILSON

I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has

done, son.  He's about as straight as a

dog's hind leg.

FEATHER

But I can't be sure.  I don't even know

who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many

layers around him.

WILSON

Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm

here on another matter entirely.

FEATHER

(moves to window)

Yeah, I guess you are.

WILSON

Good job your lot showed up when they did

or it would've been

me

for the high jump.

FEATHER

That dude who works for Valentine.  He's

the one sent those guys after you.  You

know that.

WILSON

Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.

FEATHER

So what's your beef, pal?

WILSON

Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.

(moves to window)

I can see how all this import-export

malarkey might give rise to confusion

where I'm concerned.  A foreigner,

showing up unexpectedly, like.

FEATHER

(looks at him)

It was you.  Downtown.

WILSON

(all innocent)

Eh?

FEATHER

Because that wasn't anything to do with

me.  And suspicion has been cast in my

direction.

(pondering)

Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those

shitheads over me, cutting me out of the

deal, then screwing them over too.

WILSON

No, I can reassure you on that point.

Valentine was just as surprised by that

turn of events as you.

FEATHER

He'd already grabbed more than his

allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so

bold as to take all of it.

WILSON

All of what?

FEATHER

Of the deal, man.

WILSON

Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.

FEATHER

But if you're mad at him too and he's mad

at you ... that must make us pals.

WILSON

As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.

FEATHER

(weary of his life)

In which case I'll just do what I usually

do.

WILSON

And that is?

FEATHER

What am I doing?

WILSON

Looking the other way.

(turns to go)

Gotcha.

CUT.

EXT. INN.  DAY.

TOM

(to Rick)

I mean, how much are you getting?  Just

as a point of interest.  See, I didn't

realize there was a sliding scale.

INT. POOL HALL.  DAY.

STACY

Straight rotation, no shit, call your

shot.

UNCLE JOHN

Lemme break.

CREEP

You broke last time.

STACY

Let him break - he likes to break.

CREEP

Fuck you.

STACY

I wouldn't talk.

CREEP

Huh?

STACY

I saw your mother on the Strip last

night.  She went up to three guys, said

she'd like 'em to stick one in each,

know what I mean?

BARTENDER

(calls)

Stacy.

BARTENDER (cont'd)

I can do without you inhibiting my

business.

STACY

(into phone)

Yeah.

STACY (cont'd)

We've been fired.

CUT.

EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  L.A.  DAY

GRAMMS

(re:  the burnt garage)

Valentine had himself a party, I hear.

FIELDING

(by rote)

My client has already given a statement

regarding yesterday's events.

GRAMMS

A

statement

?  I wouldn't mind getting a

statement.  You see,

my

client -- the

United States Government -- would love to

get a statement about a few of the deals

going down with your client.

FIELDING

Deals?  My client is involved in any

number of deals at any given moment.

You'd have to be more specific.

GRAMMS

Your client have a deal in Long Beach?

How about downtown?  There's some folks

there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any

of this ring a bell?

FIELDING

My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his

lawyer, not his business manager.

GRAMMS

So you wouldn't have any idea how your

client continues to make so much fucking

money.

FIELDING

He's always been very forward-thinking.

He invested wisely.

GRAMMS

Where is he now?

FIELDING

He had urgent business in the north.

CUT.

INT. RESTAURANT.  KITCHEN.  DAY.

WILSON

(over)

Where's Big Sur?

ELAINE

(over)

Up the coast.

WILSON

(over)

How far?

ELAINE

(over)

I don't know -- few hours, I guess.

WILSON

(over)

Fancy it?

ELAINE

(over)

I could use a vacation.  Of course, I

keep forgetting, for you this

is

a

vacation.

WILSON

(over)

Never thought of that.

(grunt of laughter)

Busman's holiday.

ELAINE

(over)

What's in Big Sur?

WILSON

(over)

That's where Valentine's scarpered.

ELAINE

(over)

How do you know?

WILSON

(over)

Bloke told me.

WILSON (cont'd)

(over)

You shouldn't go back to your place.  Not

till ... this is resolved.

ELAINE

(over)

I hear it's a nice drive.

CUT.

EXT. RESTAURANT.  BACK ALLEY.

CUT.

EXT. COAST HIGHWAY.  DAY.

INT. CAR.

ED

What d'you say, Elaine?

ELAINE

Not much -- you?

ED

Same.

ELAINE

Uh-huh.

ED

Last time I saw you, weren't you up for

some equity-waiver thing?

ELAINE

Probably.

ED

I was gonna be in that Michael Mann

movie, you know -- with Pacino and

DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.

ELAINE

Really.

ED

Didn't get it.

ELAINE

Well, those are the breaks.

ED

Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that

acting shit, man.

ELAINE

You just cooking then?

ED

Hell, no.  I started writing.

EXT. HIGHWAY.  DAY.

CUT.

INT. BAR.  DAY.

UNCLE JOHN

We coulda used the other two-and-a-half

grand.

STACY

There's more than a measly few grand in

this.

UNCLE JOHN

There is?

STACY

Something's on.

UNCLE JOHN

What?

STACY

I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever-

his-name-is than he thinks I know about

him and his operation.

UNCLE JOHN

You do?

STACY

You bet.

UNCLE JOHN

Like what.

STACY

Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not

week-to-week.  I don't have the

credentials.  He thinks I'm just a

sociopath, someone he can turn to when he

needs "plausible denial."

UNCLE JOHN

Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't

wrong.

STACY

(savage mimicry)

"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this

asshole who

did

just go to work for him.

Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents

just told me he took a road trip up the

coast.

That's

the type of individual gets

hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off

to his family while on the job.

UNCLE JOHN

I don't get it.

STACY

I don't know who that English guy is.

Some kind of --

(finding the word)

-- courier or something.  Maybe a seller.

Maybe a buyer.  But Mr.

Avery

wanted him,

those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha

there's a briefcase somewhere.

UNCLE JOHN

What's in it?

STACY

(shrugs)

Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.

UNCLE JOHN

How we gonna get that lucky?

STACY

While they're all fucking each other

over ... couple of parties like us could

move right in.

CUT.

EXT. HIGHWAY.  DAY.

INT. WILSON'S CAR.

ED

I've been wondering something.

WILSON

Again?

ED

Do you have any friends, man?

WILSON

Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah.

Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet

some of the lads.

ELAINE

(a little more pointed)

Friends and

colleagues

.

WILSON

You can't count on very many people,

that's the trouble.  Number of times a

decent job's been cocked up ...

ELAINE

Poor baby.

WILSON

Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post

Office once.

ED

What post office?

WILSON

The lot.  The whole British bloody Post

Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all

worked out -- work of genius, it was.

Could I get anybody interested?  No --

they're too busy pinching orange squash

from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble

sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the

crack of dawn.

ELAINE

You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.

WILSON

Too bleeding true, 'n' it.

EXT. HIGHWAY.

CUT.

EXT. HOUSE.  BIG SUR.  DAY.

VALENTINE

Hello there.

SUSAN

What are you doing here?

VALENTINE

Exercising my visitation rights.

SUSAN

Since when?

VALENTINE

I miss my kids.

SUSAN

They're at college.  Or doesn't your

accountant even tell you where the money

goes anymore.

INT. HOUSE.

VALENTINE

You've made it ... brighter.

SUSAN

I don't want you here, Terry.

VALENTINE

Sure you do.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

Don't shut the door -- I have people with

me.

SUSAN

What kind of trouble are you in?

VALENTINE

No trouble.

SUSAN

Surely you can think of somewhere else to

take one of your chippies for a quick

getaway.

VALENTINE

Susan.

VALENTINE (cont'd)

I just need ... somewhere remote.  Away

from L.A.  For a couple of days.

(now the kicker)

I pay for this house too.

SUSAN

What have you done?

AVERY

(to Valentine)

We weren't followed.

(to Susan)

Susan.

VALENTINE

(moving, looking around)

Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --

SUSAN

-- You know his name is Frank.

VALENTINE

Is he here?

SUSAN

You know I don't live with him.

VALENTINE

Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers

workshop or artists colony, Esselin

retreat, nudist camp --

SUSAN

Are you finished?

VALENTINE

In a couple of days this whole thing --

SUSAN

Who's looking for you?

VALENTINE

Go now.

SUSAN

It's been five minutes and I'm packing to

leave again.  I can't believe this.

VALENTINE

That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm

to blame.  It's that simple.

SUSAN

It

is

that simple.  I blame you for

everything

.  Losing inhibitions and

chicks without bras didn't

have

to lead

to hardcore porno in every American

household:  that was

you

.  The first on

your block to turn on a camera in a hot

tub and peddle it to your friends.  A

little recreational pot didn't

inevitably

have to lead to the eventual devastation

of the inner cities:

you

made that

happen, the first time you bought a

bigger stash than you yourself meant to

smoke.  It happened when you made your

first buck hyping some so-called "event"

that was over before it began or marketed

some "product" whose only value was its

instant disposability.  You were the

first person to see there was a lot of

money to be made selling

Navajo rugs

--

you've even stolen from the fucking

Indians!  You looked at Charlie Manson

when all he had to show for himself was a

guitar instead of a knife and saw another

merry prankster, the freedom of the

frontier.  Your pal here --

(Avery)

-- He saw gated communities.  Rich people

coming to him with their money, terrified

of what people like you had

left

of this

society.  Why invest in a marriage and

children when you had

him

?

He's

your

oracle.  But you couldn't even trust in

friendship, could you?  Still he's the

dog you call for its dinner.  Because

everything that might once have been fun

or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and

cold and sour.  That was your "genius,"

Terry.  Haven't you read your own press?

CUT.

EXT. MOTEL.  EVENING.

ELAINE

(finding herself at another

shithole)

What is it, you just like the reassuring

smell of disinfectant?

ED

Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's

saying half the time?

ELAINE

No, but I know what he means.

CUT.

EXT. DECK.  BIG SUR HOUSE.  NIGHT.

VALENTINE

(finally, to Avery)

Do any of these guys cook?

CUT.

EXT. MOTEL PORCH.  EVENING.

ED

... Reminds me of Jennifer.

ELAINE

(barely perceptible nod)

Hard to miss.

ED

I thought maybe you just came for the

ride.

ELAINE

I'd rather be with him than without him.

I don't want to be found dead in L.A.

VALENTINE

We think someone is here.

We can't find ...

TOM

(fucking typical)

Larry and Rick.

ADHARA

Did somebody call the cops?

VALENTINE

No.

ADHARA

Why not?

Because I'm taking care of it.

Tell you ...

WILSON

About Jenny.

(closer)

Tell me about Jenny.

(closer)

About the

deal

.  Whatever fucking deal

you had to kill my daughter for when she

found out about it, you bastard.

WILSON

Tell me.  Tell me about it, you fucking

bastard.

VALENTINE

She could've had the deal!  I would've

handed it to her if she wanted.  I would

have given her everything.

WILSON

Why

then.  Why did you do it!

VALENTINE

She didn't want to share it, she wanted

to stop it.  To stop me.

She said she'd

turn me in

.

VALENTINE

She said, "You go ahead with this, I'll

turn you in, Terry."

VALENTINE

She was serious.  She would have done it.

She had the phone in her hand.  She was

going to do it.

FLASH CUTS:

LADY

You're English.

WILSON

Yeah, that's right.

LADY

I can never decide what I like better.

Leaving home, or coming back.

FLASH CUTS:

WILSON

I would have preferred staying home, me.

LADY

You're a reluctant traveller, then.

FLASH CUTS:

WILSON

Got called out to L.A., unexpected like,

to do a job of work.

FLASH CUTS:

LADY

You'll be looking forward to getting

back, then.

WILSON

Yeah.  Another little matter needs

attending to soon as I return.

LADY

No rest for the wicked.

FLASH CUT:

WILSON

Been away a lot.

LADY

Where else?

WILSON

Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea.

Nine years.

LADY

Nine years?

(laughs)

Is that legal?

WILSON

Well, time off for good behavior, you

know.  I shouldn't have even been there

-- it was these other blokes who shoulda

gone in my place.  I got lumbered with

the job they were responsible for.  I

don't mind pulling me own cart, but not

someone else's, know what I mean.

LADY

But you stuck it out, anyway, all that

time.

WILSON

I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it.

Then just when I'd finished my nine years

-- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger

off to the States.

LADY

(reacting slightly to his

"colorful" language)

Sounds like you need a rest.

WILSON

Could do, yeah.

WILSON

But first I gotta give these lads a

talking to, these geezers what sent me up

the river, in a manner of speaking.

LADY

The ones whose burden you took upon your

own shoulders.

WILSON

Yeah.

WILSON

Them next.

CUT TO BLACK.
