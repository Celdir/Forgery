"ANTITRUST"

Screenplay by

Howard Franklin

SHOOTING DRAFT

2001

VOICE

Wow. That's hard. I'd have to say

it's the day we launched Outpost

'98.

DIFFERENT VOICE (DARYL)

It's the beverages.

DARYL

Gary always makes sure we've got the

coolest stuff to drink.

DIFFERENT VOICE (DIANA)

Knowing your work means something.

DIANA (V.O.)

Knowing everywhere in the world,

this is the software people use.

DIANA (V.O.)

20 years ago, Gary had an idea, that's

all he had. And now the company's

bigger than IBM.

VOICE (V.O.)

It's the people. Which is weird.

MITCH

Big companies are s'posed to be

impersonal.

MITCH (V.O.)

There's this myth that doing a start-

up is cooler. But there's no community

with a start-up. No permanence.

DONNY

It bums me out when the media say

we're cultish, or whatever. Why?

'Cause we care about each other?

MITCH

'Love you too, bro.

VOICE (TERRY)

I'll tell you what's not cool.

TERRY

How Gary gets this superbad rap.

TERRY (V.O.)

There's this prejudice against super-

smart people. People like Gary.

GARY

A kid working in his garage can create

the next Outpost, the new IBM. All

it takes is a great idea.

GARY

That's why nobody can have a monopoly

in a business built on ideas.

DIFFERENT VOICE (V.O.)

The coolest? Gary. He's like you or

me. If we happened t'be insanely

rich.

LARRY

Can we go?

VOICE (FROM THE FILM)

For me? It's Seattle!

LARRY

'Starting to get nauseated.

BRIAN

Do you mind?

VOICE FROM THE MOVIE

Did anybody mention the beverages?

ALICE

Is it over?

LARRY

They still have to give 'em

refreshments laced with mind-altering

drugs.

ALICE

You are a fanatic.

LARRY

'Gonna wait outside.

LARRY (AT FIRST O.S.)

Alice? You gotta make him do the

start-up with Teddy and me.

ALICE

"Make" him?

LARRY

(thoughtfully)

You know what I mean.

LARRY (V.O.)

I'm not exactly worldly, but I'm the

Secretary of State next to him.

LARRY (V.O.)

And they're all throwing this --

stuff at him. Stock options. Pay

packages.

LARRY

I'm just screwed.

ALICE

(that's not true)

You know what he's like. He just

wants to work on stuff that's cool.

LARRY

You don't wanna move, do you?

ALICE

I can paint anywhere.

ALICE

I'd like to stay here, yeah. And I

kind of think he should be with Teddy.

ALICE (V.O.)

I mean, nobody else can follow what

they're talking about half the time.

MILO/TEDDY

(under Alice)

'Could be a condition-variable in

the locking code -- If it didn't seg

fault, first!

ALICE

Maybe you shouldn't push it so hard.

About Outpost. No offense, you sound

insane.

LARRY

I can't help it. I feel like they'd

do anything to keep their --

ALICE

Anything? That's not even credible.

If he wants to go up there? To check

it out? I think you should encourage

him.

(seeing Larry's

incredulity)

It's his life. But everybody's

treating him like this -- valuable

object. You're hurting your own case.

BRIAN

He's my god. I hear he actually calls

recruits sometimes. Or is that an

Urban Legend?

REDMOND

Gary's running the biggest software

company in the world, Brian. He's

being harassed by the Justice

Department, and he's got a new baby.

DANNY

Milo? I'm Danny.

MILO

Oh hi.

DANNY

Gary would like to speak to you?

MILO

...Hello?

GARY (ON THE PHONE)

Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and

your friend can come up here. We've

made some amazing strides in digital

convergence. I'd love to show them

to you.

MILO

You would? Wow. When would we come?

(he waits; he looks

up)

'Think he hung up.

ALICE

But how does he know that's what you

guys're working on?

MILO

All the companies know. The faculties

tell 'em. At the target schools.

LARRY

In exchange for endowments. They

should just drop the pretense and

name the schools after 'em.

BRIAN

(to Teddy)

I can't believe you refused a ticket!

TEDDY

My parents're already freaked-out

I'm staying here. 50 miles from

Chinatown.

BRIAN

Well maybe if you told 'em how much

money you'd be making --

(to Milo)

You're going up there. Right?

LARRY

I think you should go.

MILO

(amazed)

You do?

LARRY

I mean, it's your life.

MILO

I think I kind of lost it. I was

just so thrilled to be talking to

the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't

know I even cared about that stuff.

ALICE

C'mon, how often do you talk to

somebody who's been on the cover of

Time. Three of four times.

MILO

A lot of what Larry says is true.

They just clone stuff, or reverse

engineer it, and everybody gets stuck

with their inferior version cause

they --

ALICE

Then you've gotta ask him about that.

ALICE

It's important.

MILO

If he's really a bully, he won't cop

to it, anyway.

ALICE

Bully? Are we talking about Gary

Boyd? Or your dad.

MILO

When I was a kid? And he was moving

us all over the place? I spent all

my time writing stuff on Outpost

1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the

greatest.

ALICE

But he's not quite the same guy

anymore. Don't get your hopes too

high?

DANNY

'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?

MILO

He's pretty tight with his family.

DANNY

We could move 'em up here.

MILO

He just likes to write code. He's

bummed there's so much secrecy and

competition, everybody trying to own

everything.

REDMOND

Who do you mean by "everybody."

MILO

So -- how far are we from the campus?

REDMOND

Oh we're not going to the campus.

MILO

Who's that?

DANNY

I think they call him the "Houseman."

'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.

DANNY

Don't be nervous. The house is the

weirdest thing about him.

REDMOND

It's like he knows everybody expects

him to be this worldly, colorful

zillionaire. But he's just a guy who

likes software.

HOUSEMAN

Have a seat. He won't be long.

PHIL

We tried the big vaporware number,

Gary, it's no-sale.

RANDY

Can we buy into their IPO? Or is

that a Justice Dept. problem?

PHIL

There is no public offering. The guy

who wrote it joined some freakazoid

cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this

just to run their web site.

GARY

Milo? Excuse the tie. I was on TV.

MILO

...That's okay.

GARY

The house knows the paintings I like,

it knows my favorite music. Same for

anybody else who's in the system.

MILO

Cool!

GARY

Would you like a Coke or something?

MILO

(too shy, too nervous)

Oh. No thanks.

GARY

When we started, I just hired my

smart friends. That was great. We

got a little bigger, I had to hire

smart strangers. Much harder.

GARY

Now I don't get to hire anybody. But

I know you're the guy to write

Skywire.

MILO

You know a lot about art, I guess.

GARY

There's a rumor going around, maybe

you've heard it.

GARY

There's more to life than computers?

I'm looking into it.

GARY

'Once I start looking into something.

GARY

I've only shown this to three other

people. I bought 200, we've launched

12 so far. I keep the coordinates in

this room.

(as Milo takes it,

carefully)

It's left over from SDI. Reagan's

Star Wars technology? They orbit 426

miles up.

MILO

Low enough to relay internet traffic.

GARY

(he smiles: exactly)

Among other things... We know

convergence is the real super-highway:

all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc.

linked together. Why cram it into a

cable if you can use the whole sky?

MILO

(turning the sleek

object)

Skywire.

GARY

The content filer has t'be written

into the media files so bits coming

off the satellite can be read by

multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms.

Including whatever new hardware

emerges.

MILO

It needs a more object-oriented

language. This doesn't scale, does

it?

GARY

You'd have to start practically from

scratch. But this is all you'd be

working on. No marketing meetings,

no product seminars. We can't waste

the time. Half the Valley's working

on convergence. So're media

conglomerates, cable companies, phone

companies. 'Can't finish second,

Milo. There is no second... Now what

would you like to ask me?

MILO

...Ask you?

GARY

I know what people say, and not just

the Justice Department. We clone

ideas, inflict our second-rate

versions on the world, we haven't

done anything original since 1.0.

GARY

Do I think that's fair? No. I'd put

some of our apps up against anybody's.

But is there some truth to it?

GARY

When you get to a certain age, you

start wondering. About your legacy.

I doubt you even remember Outpost

1.0 --

MILO

I do!

GARY

(pleased)

Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I

wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100

in cyber-years. I look at you and

see the things that got me here.

(the furrows deepen)

But somehow got away.

MILO

If my dad'd leveled with me like

that even once... The weird thing

is, my fantasy he could somehow be

like the old Gary? It's his fantasy,

too.

ALICE

I think that's great, Milo. I do.

MILO

...But?

ALICE

Didn't you visit the campus?

MILO

I forgot. That's why you have to

help me decide.

ALICE

No way. You have this -- destiny.

MILO

C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny

without you. My destiny would be

dying at 20. From eating --

ALICE

Don't bring that up. Like a different

girlfriend would'd've let you die?

MILO

(shrugs)

You saved my life in alot of ways.

ALICE

It's not just Gary that makes you

wanna go there? 'Cause it's a big

place. You might not even see him

again.

MILO

I know.

MILO

When's Brian coming for the TV?

ALICE

Prob'ly waiting by the phone for

Outpost to call. We'll leave it for

him?

ALICE

'Give you guys some time alone.

MILO

...You got my E-mail?

TEDDY

And your phone messages. You wanna

do what you do, it's not a crime.

MILO

Is that how Larry feels?

TEDDY

Uh. Not exactly.

MILO

Wanted to say goodbye to him...

TEDDY

Hey, we got seed money for the

startup! A million-five!

TEDDY

We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.

(he gives Milo the

number)

You know what's the bad part? We

can't talk about work anymore. We're

competitors! The venture capitalists

made us sign like 100 confidentiality

forms.

MILO

Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess

we'll find out what else we have to

talk about. Life stuff.

MILO

Guess what? They got their --

ALICE

Milo, this is Mr. Barton from the

Justice Department.

(gives Barton the

water)

Sorry about the glass.

BARTON

Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a

friend. Or maybe a supplicant.

MILO

Right... What's that mean again?

BARTON

Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with

Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart

as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell

which technologies pose the threat

of a monopoly. We need a really smart

guy to help us pick our fights. I'm

taking a shot in the dark, here. I

can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick.

I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's

the right thing to do.

MILO

(fiddling with the

card)

It's just -- I kind of feel the need

to do something with my ability.

Create something...

BARTON

Like I said: shot in the dark.

BARTON

If you see something there that rubs

you the wrong way? Do the right thing.

MILO

That took some fun out of --

ALICE

We're not gonna let it.

CNN VOICE

-- ingested the fatal mixture of

sedatives crushed in apple sauce.

According to the cult's eerily

professional website, it was "time

to move on..."

REDMOND

There're 20 buildings, I mean not

counting the Gyms, the Day Care,

etc.

REDMOND

Gary's put millions in there. And

the people with kids? They're not

hotshot geeks, they're just payroll

clerks or whatever.

REDMOND

You'll see alot of that: Department

of Justice goons snooping around.

REDMOND

So how'd you like the house?

MILO

His Snapples were in alphabetical

order.

REDMOND

(he laughs)

Well, he micro-managed the company

till it got too big...

(he opens the door)

'Guess he needs to micro-manage

something.

RECEPTIONIST

Milo, I'm Judith. Welcome!

REDMOND

Everybody has the same office, there's

no dumbass corporate hierarchy.

DESI

Get out while you can, dude!

REDMOND

Desi, Milo.

DESI

The guy who was at Gary's house?

REDMOND

Best bomb shelters in America,

accessible from every building. You

gotta figure we're a major target,

right?

REDMOND

Whoa. Lisa actually looked at you.

REDMOND

Every geek here's got a thing for

Lisa. But that's about the biggest

reaction she's had to anybody.

MILO

(shy, changing the

emphasis)

She's a programmer?

REDMOND

Heavy graphical background, doing

design-interface for Skywire apps.

(he all but winks)

You'll be working with her.

MILO

I've got a girlfriend, remember?

REDMOND

Right. That's rare around here. You

know how nuns' re-married to Jesus?

'Posties are married to Outpost.

REDMOND

Here's your world.

(pointing at the desk)

Copy of Gary's book, also the audio

version, narrated by Gary.

VOICE (SHROT)

The card's encoded. Tells us who

came through the door and when.

SHROT

Unauthorized entries sound like this.

SHROT

If you see a tailgater, report him.

MILO

Tailgater?

SHROT

(kills the alarm)

Somebody coming in on your swipe.

(gives Milo a photo

ID)

You see somebody wandering around

without ID, it's your duty to

challenge him. I don't give a shit

if you're a stock-option billionaire.

If you don't challenge, I'll have

your butt.

MILO

He seems a little -- tense.

REDMOND

Geeks pull his chain cause he's non-

tech. Ex-cop or something. They moon

cameras, or use ATM's as swipe cards.

The cameras're our real security so

he's a little demoralized.

MILO

What're they building?

REDMOND

#21. Way behind schedule. It's top-

secret, but everybody knows it's a

digital broadcast space. They see

the dishes on top, the fiber optics

going in.

MILO

Gary's not into fiber optics. He's

betting everything on the satellites.

REDMOND

You wanna survive in the software

business, you cover your bets... I

gotta say, this is the weirdest car

anybody ever requested.

REDMOND

Oh, right. Your girlfriend's an

artist.

REDMOND

I phoned her at your hotel, told her

about our corporate housing options.

She sounds neat.

MILO

...She is.

(turning away from

Lisa)

She is!

REDMOND

'Might be some friction on the

domestic front. You're expected you

to put in ridiculous hours. People've

accused us of breaking up

relationships to get their undivided

attention.

REDMOND

Your counselor'll fill you in on

everything else. That's who you'll

be working with almost daily.

VOICE

Busy?

MILO

No! Just waiting for my counselor to

come by and introduce himself.

GARY

Okay. I'm Gary.

GARY

'Think I should buy some originals?

MILO

...Do I?

GARY

Somebody said I'm just another

Philistine. With reproductions.

MILO

That's insane. You're ahead of your

time.

GARY

That's what I told her. My wife.

GARY

'Thinks I'll be less of a control

freak if I have a hobby. 'Just gives

me something else to obsess about...

GARY

Anything we can salvage from the old

code before you start fresh?

MILO

Uh, might be one or two things.

DISSOLVE TO:

GEEK 1

He's been in there like an hour.

GEEK 2

Shit.

MILO

Could work with a new switch. There

may be a few more things hidden.

GARY

Don't spend too much time searching.

You ever vetted somebody's old code

before?

(when Milo shakes his

head)

It's a different skill. Stay close

to the surface. The best-hidden

secrets are in plain sight. You know

the best place to hide a leaf, right?

(when Milo shakes his

head)

In a tree.

ALICE

...The corporate condos were as

romantic as they sound.

MILO

You know he's never been anybody's

counselor before?

ALICE

Milo! What about --?

MILO

Oh, It's great. It's great!

(they start to kiss,

but:)

'Think I should tell him I learned

everything using 1.0? Maybe I could

show him one of my early programs.

DOJ AGENT

"Infotek's urgent need to license

Outpost Office is such that we can

use it as a tool in the current

negotiation."

(looks up)

When you wrote the word "tool," what'd

you mean by it?

GARY

I don't remember.

DOJ AGENT

What d'you think you meant by it?

GARY

I'm confused. Am I supposed to

speculate under oath?

OTHER AGENT

Since you didn't have an answer to

that question, Mr. Boyd --

GARY

("confused" again)

Didn't I? Have an answer? "I don't

remember."

DOJ AGENT

Did you wanna take a break, Mr. Boyd?

PHIL

Your protege's moving so fast we can

barely keep up with him.

GARY

This is good. Who did it?

PHIL

'Start-up not 50 miles from here.

Kid's on Prozac.

GARY

Maybe we should all get on it.

GARY

How's it going?

MILO

Maybe I'm going too fast.

GARY

(sharply; incredulous)

Too fast? At least four companies're

on the verge of workable convergence

systems, Milo, they --

GARY

Even when I had a hand in every aspect

of the company I knew the one thing

you can never control is somebody's

creative process.

MILO

It's okay. Really.

GARY

(reaching into his

pocket)

Take a look at this. Slightly

different approach.

MILO

You did this -- overnight?

GARY

You're making me young again.

NEWS VOICE

...A graduate of MIT, he was on the

antidepressant Prozac, and had been

warned not to drink and drive. (Etc.)

LISA

Milo?

MILO

Lisa.

LISA

You know my name.

MILO

You know mine.

LISA

You're famous around here.

MILO

(winces)

I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.

LISA

I wouldn't worry about it. You've

gotta figure most people around here

were their teachers' pets.

MILO

...Were you?

LISA

We moved around so much I barely

knew my teachers.

MILO

Me too! Were you an Army brat or

something?

LISA

...Something like that. Yeah.

MILO

Didn't mean to pry. I just have this

theory. Some of us who got to good

at this? We were -- escaping

something.

MILO

Did I say something?

LISA

No, I know what you mean. I used to

spend my life wishing people could

be like computers. Least they make

sense. Sometimes you think they've

betrayed you. Like a person would.

But then you see, no, you just missed

a step. You can go back and make it

all work.

MILO

I used to wish that. All the time.

MILO

(re: the CD-ROM)

What've you got there?

LISA

Graphical interfaces. For Skywire?

I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.

MILO

Show me.

MILO

Cool!

LISA

Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms,

ranging from the narrowest bandwidth

to --

MILO

...Sh-Show me the next one.

SECRETARY

Have a seat. He's with someone, but

I know he wants to see you.

LAWYER

Because we bundled it, the judge is

threatening to enjoin the whole --

GARY

I'm confused, Ted.

GARY

Didn't you tell me they'd be Chapter

12 by the time they could hope to

enjoin? I'm very confused, because

you said they'd be ready to settle.

SECRETARY

Go on in.

(when Milo looks

dubious)

He's always happy to see you.

GARY

Milo. What's up?

MILO

Well -- you sent for me.

GARY

Right... Right.

MILO

You really wrote this just today?

GARY

(dark, unsmiling)

What're you implying.

MILO

(taken aback)

Nothing!

GARY

Everything I do is under scrutiny.

The questions they ask, trying to

make anything strategic look sordid.

(knits his brow)

I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in

business try to get ahead?

MILO

(uncomfortable)

I'm sure.

GARY

The purpose of this company isn't to

destroy our competitors any more

than the purpose of living is to

breath. But the software business is

binary: you're a zero or a one. Being

obsessive isn't a crime. It's a

character trait.

GARY

It scales, don't you think?

MILO

Definitely.

ALICE

This feels fairly grown up, I'd say.

MILO

To our new life.

(she's looking at him)

...What's wrong?

ALICE

That's what I need to ask you.

(when he says nothing)

You know you can't keep anything

from me.

MILO

He gave me some new code-fixes this

morning. I said, "Did you really do

this just today?" Cause I was

impressed. He said "What're you

implying?"

MILO

It's the way he said it. Just the

way my dad did, when he was caught

in a lie. That's how you knew you

were onto something ugly.

ALICE

(just confused)

What would it mean, anyway? If he

didn't write it?

MILO

That's what I'm asking myself. Does

he have some genius stowed away? Why

not let him write Skywire.

(upset)

'Not saying it makes sense.

ALICE

Milo!

MILO

I'm so stupid.

ALICE

He's your boss. He's not your --

MILO

(he's nodding)

I know, I know.

ALICE

If you can't deal with him on that

basis, you better get a new counselor.

MILO

(the very idea hurts)

Isn't that -- extreme?

ALICE

What's extreme is what that ER doctor

said when he pumped your stomach.

Eat another sesame seed and that's

it.

ALICE

I mean, if one little comment from

Gary is gonna upset you this much --

MILO

You're right. It's -- a working

relationship. Don't know what I was

expecting.

ALICE

C'mon. Let's do the toast?

LISA

Did you wanna be alone?

MILO

No. Please.

LISA

They just pushed up the schedule on

Skywire apps. How fast are you going?

MILO

"There is no second place." Plus

every time I get jammed-up, Gary has

an inspiration.

(looks at her, curious)

Is it like that with your counselor?

LISA

Mine's not the CEO. He barely

remembers to take a shower.

MILO

Right, right. But does he ever just,

like, hand you code?

LISA

Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.

MILO

(he smiles)

You're compulsive.

LISA

Mmm-more like -- I have a little

trouble. Trusting people.

MILO

Why's that?

LISA

Long story. Not that interesting.

MILO

So, when you were talking about

wishing people were more like

computers. Was that then? Or now?

LISA

Then and now.

(when he looks at her)

But not right now.

VOICE

Milo!

BRIAN

Just dropped off a resume. Almost

got in the front door.

MILO

You're living here?

BRIAN

'Thought if I relocated it could

help my case. I'm writing programs

for the local public access station.

Where any whack-job with 100 bucks

gets his own show? God, does it suck.

(gives him a business

card)

Can you help me?

MILO

Sure, I'll see what I can do.

BRIAN

Well I parked illegally. See y'later?

MILO

(watching Brian go)

'Forgot to introduce you.

(a beat)

I have a girlfriend.

LISA

That's great. I -- didn't know.

MILO

She saved my life.

MILO (O.S.)

How's it going down there?

TEDDY (ON THE PHONE)

I've been hacking for five night's

straight, I'm really making headway.

TEDDY

But these, like, White Supremacists

trashed my office, last week.

MILO

What?!

TEDDY

They're in the neighborhood. They

usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.

MILO

Jesus, Teddy.

TEDDY

I'm cool. They didn't touch the

machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't

know what they were. So, you a Moonie

yet?

(he waits)

Milo?

MILO

I met this girl.

TEDDY

What? Come on. Is it serious?

MILO

I don't know.

TEDDY

Did you tell Alice?

MILO

No! I keep thinking it'll go away.

But there's this -- connection. She's

been hacking since she was little,

she had to move around a lot. Plus I

see her every day, we're working on

the same program. She's -- beautiful.

TEDDY

A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound

paranoid, or like a pig, but what're

the chances?

MILO

What d'you mean?

TEDDY

I dunno. I guess Larry's got me

totally suspicious of that place.

MILO

What does that mean?

TEDDY

Milo, geeks don't have two

girlfriends. Most don't have one.

MILO

I didn't plan this.

GARY (O.S.)

What'd the girl say?

PHIL

There may be a little less trust

after your outburst.

PHIL

Hasn't affected his work, though.

GARY

Nothing does. Still. I want him to

like me.

MILO

...What's wrong?

MILO

What!

ALICE

Teddy was killed last night.

MILO

What're you -- what?

ALICE

It was a hate crime.

ALICE

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

NELSON

They trashed his hard disk, all his

back-ups. Nothing's left.

MILO

They caught the guys?

NELSON

It's an airtight case. They found

the weapon with Teddy's blood on it

and their fingerprints. They'd been

arrested twice for beating-up Asians.

How come they weren't in jail?

MILO

He told me about the break-in. He

didn't seem to take it that seriously.

NELSON

You guys don't take anything seriously

do you? That's not on a hard drive?

ALICE

Nelson? Your mom wants you. It's

time to go to scatter the ashes.

MILO

I didn't know he was working with

fiber optics.

ALICE

We gotta go too, honey.

MILO

I know you lost all his work. Maybe

I could come down here and --

LARRY

You are naive. Look at your employment

contract: you can't work anywhere

else in this field for at least few

years.

(he smiles sadly)

Not that I don't miss you.

MILO

Just thought his work should go on.

LARRY

He was on the verge of something,

too. He was gonna show us the next

day. He said "The answer's not in

the box, it's in the band." Know

what it means?

MILO

It's only meaningful when you've got

40,000 lines of code to back it up.

LARRY

Man, could he write code. Totally

elegant. He had his own style.

MILO

Those really weird, short lines.

LARRY

Take good care of this guy.

LISA

You okay?

GARY

I heard what happened.

MILO

Were the flags for Teddy?

GARY

Had you talked to him much lately?

MILO

Just once. 'Guess I was worried we

didn't have anything to talk about,

since work was off-limits. Non-

disclosure.

GARY

Did you?

MILO

Talk about work? Never!

GARY

I meant did you find other stuff to --

MILO

Oh. Yeah.

GARY

You've been coming in early.

MILO

It helps. Alice said it would help.

To focus on something.

(a little guilty)

'Don't know what I'd do without her.

ALICE

You okay?

(sits by him, holds

him)

I miss him, too.

DISSOLVE TO:

GARY

Milo?

MILO

Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of

code there...

GARY

34,000. But they're real short lines.

'Just came out that way.

GARY

Been thinking about the push mechanism

in the handler. And it came over me:

it's in the wrong place.

MILO

(an uncertain smile)

The wrong place?

GARY

The answer's not in the box. It's in

the band.

LISA (O.S.)

Milo? You okay?

MILO

Gotta go home. 'Think I ate something.

MILO

Alice? Alice!

ALICE

Are you saying you think they had

something to do with his death? Nelson

said it was an airtight case.

MILO

I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe --

maybe they hired those guys.

ALICE

I can't see Outpost putting its

reputation in the hands of people

like that.

MILO

I don't know! I just know it was

Teddy's code. All these ideas flying

in from everywhere. You know how he

says "Any kid working in his garage

can put us out of business?" It's

like they know what every kid's doing.

ALICE

They hack into people's programs?

MILO

Nobody does work like this on-line.

It's in your PC, or in a mainframe.

Self-contained. They'd have to be,

like, watching people. Physically.

(he freezes)

Oh Jesus.

MILO

(almost silently)

It's a camera.

MILO

It isn't a broadcast studio. It's --

a surveillance post or something.

That's why they have the dishes on

top.

ALICE

You're scaring me. I think we should

just go.

MILO

Go where? You can't get away from

people like this.

ALICE

"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking

about.

MILO

(it really hurts)

You think I don't know that?

ALICE

Milo. Why would he --

MILO

How should I know? "Solving a

problem," I guess. Or needing to

control everything. I don't know.

(can't think about it)

I've gotta get in there.

ALICE

Even if all this were true. There're

20 other buildings. All of them filled

with computers and --

MILO

It's the only one with dishes on the

roof. The studio's a front. That's

why they keep postponing its opening.

(muttered, obsessive)

...gotta get in there.

ALICE

Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents

are all over the place. How could

they hope to hide a surveillance

post?

(as he mulls this)

And how can you get in there, anyway?

With the cameras and the swipe cards --

MILO

I can't just walk away!

ALICE

You can't just walk in, either.

MILO

They stop the construction work at

six or seven. The parking lot's mostly

clear by two or three in the morning.

Even the early Geeks don't get there

before five.

ALICE

Is it two? Or is it three? Have you

ever really noticed?

MILO

No! I can't just keep my head in the

sand. That's how I got into this

mess.

MILO

I know how to get in there. But you've

gotta help me.

ALICE

(scared, reluctant)

...Whaddo I do?

MILO

So you believe me?

ALICE

Just tell me what to do.

SHORT FADE:

MILO

Come on.

GUARD

Sir, you gotta use your own --

(noticing)

Where's your ID?

MILO

Do you know who I am?

GUARD

It's my job, I gotta --

MILO

(he's getting better)

The kind of stock options I'm sitting

on?

SHROT

Every geek has to try this once to

show me how smart he is --

ANOTHER GUARD

There was an explosion in a Y-sector

closet, we're evacuating the whole

sector.

SHROT

Un-nh, can't wander around without

ID now. Just park your ass in that

chair.

GUARD (O.S.)

Whole place reeks of fuckin' ammonia.

RANDY

What is it?

SHROT

Not much. Glorified cherry bomb.

Right by the civil defense sign?

Some geek's idea of irony. I been

saying we need a camera in this hall.

RANDY

There's nothing in this hall.

Someone's pulling your chain, as

usual.

SHROT

(thinking aloud)

Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in

my office. He was tailgating, so I --

GARY

Milo? Try to have a clue. Try to

think.

RANDY

That kid's the great white hope.

SHROT

I could get it out of him.

RANDY

You're not listening.

MILO

Everything okay?

CUT TO:

DELBERT

How's it goin'?

GUARD

(shaking out his cup)

Big night. Switched from tea to

coffee. Brought new meaning to my

work.

DELBERT

Yeah? Maybe I'll start my rounds

with #21 tonight.

GUARD

You are a wild man.

VOICE (RANDY)

Well. Now he knows: nothin' in there.

RANDY

Maybe he'll get back to work.

PHIL

Speaking of which...

RANDY

Yeah, yeah.

MILO

(muttering)

...in a tree...

PHIL

Did you download Corey? In San Jose?

RANDY

Damn. 'Have to go back over there.

(he stands, stretches)

Be so much easier if we could walk

in the front door.

PHIL

You don't look anything like a three-

year-old.

He gave me this. 'Said I should come

see him if --

DOJ RECEPTIONIST

He's not in yet.

MILO

Can I wait in his office?

DOJ RECEPTIONIST

It's locked, dear.

MILO

Please.

DOJ RECEPTIONIST

Wait in his outer office.

CO-WORKER

Do I make the call, or do you?

MILO

Mr. Barton, do you remember me?

BARTON

...It's -- Milo, isn't it?

MILO

Yes sir. I need to talk to you.

BARTON

Give me two seconds with Lacy here?

(unlocks his door)

Go on in, I won't be a moment.

BARTON (O.S.)

I'll make the call, but I think you

need to send a Fax first (etc.).

BARTON

Milo?

MILO

Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

BARTON

Have a seat.

BARTON

What seems to be the problem? You

look a little upset.

MILO

I am. I am, sir.

BARTON

Milo?

MILO

My friend, my best friend, Teddy,

was killed in Silicon Valley.

BARTON

My goodness.

MILO

It was racially motivated. He's

Chinese. He was. And... I know

sometimes the FBI gets involved with

that. Don't they?

BARTON

If there's a Civil Rights violation.

But generally we let the local police

and DA do their work first.

MILO

I -- just wanna help bring these

guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.

BARTON

Let me look into it, see what's being

done. Frankly, it's not my area.

MILO

(he gets up)

'Just didn't know who else to talk

to.

BARTON

(circles an arm over

Milo)

And Outpost? You're happy there?

MILO

Yes sir.

PHIL (ON THE PHONE)

'Didn't mention he was going to the

Justice Department?

ALICE

No.

PHIL

Not like him, is it? To do a thing

like that without telling you. You're

not losing your hold on him, are

you?

ALICE

He'll tell me when he gets home.

PHIL

That'll be a test, won't it?

ALICE

Instead of busting my chops you should

do something about that girl. Fire

her. Or something.

PHIL

Lisa's an extremely valuable member

of the Skywire team. We've got our

eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.

ALICE

(as she hangs up)

Prick.

ALICE

It's almost nine, I've been so

worried!

(she takes his hands)

What did you see in there?

MILO

Nothing.

ALICE

Nothing?

MILO

It's what they said it is. An

unfinished broadcast studio. You

were right... I just drove to Seattle

and back.

ALICE

...Why?

MILO

Remember Lyle Barton?

MILO

The Justice Department guy who came

to the apartment when --

ALICE

I remember.

MILO

After I broke into 21 -- which was

insane, thank God they didn't catch

me! -- I just drove around. Trying

to figure out what possessed me. You

know what? I've been putting my own

guilt on Gary.

ALICE

Guilt?

MILO

(quietly)

If I'd stayed down there, maybe this

wouldn't've happened.

ALICE

Poor baby. You know that's not true.

MILO

I thought, instead of indulging all

these paranoid delusions, risking my

job, alienating Gary, scaring you, I

should do something useful with my

grief. Help them find Teddy's killers.

ALICE

I was so worried about you.

MILO

(through their kisses)

...been such a long night.

ALICE

That was -- different.

MILO

...Different?

ALICE

You didn't feel it? So intense.

LISA

So you're not avoiding me.

LISA

What's wrong?

MILO

I snuck into #21.

LISA

Why would you do a thing like --

MILO

You thought about it too. You've

been suspicious for a while. But

it's not happening in there. It's

happening in the Day Care.

LISA

The Day Care?

MILO

Can we go someplace else?

MILO

It's easy to know who the smart geeks

are, the schools tell 'em. They upload

medical files, school records,

pharmacy files. They'd be happy just

to steal code forever. But when a

program gets close to fruition. Like

Teddy. He was almost there.

LISA

But why would they --?

MILO

You know. There is no second place.

And what's the risk? The killings're

undetectable, they're hand-tailored,

they make "sense." I mean, they're

in the information business. They

have scenarios for all of us, too.

In case we find out too much.

MILO

I'm not one of them. Not trying to

"suss you out."

MILO

They killed my best friend! I'm living

with somebody they pay to go to bed

with me. Can't you trust somebody

just once? I don't wanna be alone

here.

LISA

I'm sorry, Milo... I'm sorry.

MILO

(forcefully)

I know why you're so secretive. Why

you won't let anybody near you.

(quieter)

I know what he did to you.

LISA

Oh yeah?

LISA

So that's in my -- file?

LISA

Is that my -- scenario?

(when he hesitates)

Tell me.

MILO

They'd frame him.

LISA

(horrified)

He's out of prison?

MILO

(he nods)

They're already watching you. If

they had to, they'd give him this

drug that mimics an alcoholic

blackout. He'd wake up not even

remembering his "act of revenge."

LISA

No.

MILO

Nobody's gonna hurt you.

LISA

...Milo?

MILO

Hmm?

LISA

I always felt if a -- boy I liked

ever found out -- he'd run. He'd

think I was unclean.

MILO

No, no. Never.

VOICE (PHIL)

All his suspicions were allayed?

VOICE

You're sure.

ALICE

He said it made sense that Gary's

code was like Teddy's, that that

cliche about great minds was true.

Said it was all about his own guilt.

(she shrugs)

Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary

mixed-up with his dad once in a while.

It always passes.

PHIL

He wasn't acting?

ALICE

I don't think he knows how.

LISA

What about the FBI?

MILO

They've got this guy in the DOJ,

maybe others. We tell the wrong

person, it's over.

LISA

Who can we trust?

MILO

There's always a logical answer --

you just have to define the question.

LISA

How do you let go of a secret without

telling the wrong person.

MILO

We don't tell anybody.

(she's puzzled)

We tell everybody. At once. So there's

no secret left to protect. When

everybody knows, they don't dare

touch us.

SHROT

(into the phone)

No, Tony can't fill in for you, he's

not at your authorization level.

LEN

Bob? You better look at this.

MILO

Do we post it on the Net?

LISA

There're so many disinformation sites

about Gary already. Where he has

devil's horns or they crop him in

with Saddam Hussein.

SHROT

Could it be a glitch? Something the

construction workers caused?

LEN

Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen.

Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em

there may have been a break-in?

SHROT

Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause

I'm not in frigging Mensa.

(walks to the window)

I swear to God, it's that kid Milo,

I told 'em so in the first place,

but they didn't even wanna hear about

it.

(turns to Len)

Let's run a printout on card entries.

LISA

The mainstream media. TV, or a

newsmagazine.

MILO

Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot

of media conglomerates. Have to be

careful who we pick.

LISA

We could cross-reference a data base

on media ownership. But not on our

own computers. Not even at home.

MILO

Certainly not at my happy home.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

MILO

Gary, hi.

GARY

You look a little tired.

MILO

I'm okay. It's going well!

GARY

'Have a look?

MILO

Sure.

GARY

Why did you move around so much?

When you were a kid.

MILO

...My dad was a compulsive gambler.

Only he didn't think he was. That

applied to guys who didn't have a

"system." "Losers," who played games

of chance. He could "read" people,

so chance had nothing to do with it.

No matter how deep a hole he dug

himself, he'd give you the whole

speech. And you'd better not point

out the obvious.

(he shrugs)

His creditors would catch up to him.

Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake

us in the middle of the night. Off

we'd go, again.

GARY

What would you tell the kids? At

your new school? You had to come up

with a good story, right?

MILO

No. I just went deeper into the

machine. Preferred being the geek to

having to explain. Lying would've

been worse.

GARY

...Worse?

MILO

Cause he was a liar. And I hated

him.

(mimicking a voice)

"Get your head out of that machine,

wise up to the real world." The more

he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause

if being savvy meant being like him --

(he shrugs)

Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless,

even now. Didn't cultivate my

conniving side. 'Not sure I even

have one.

GARY

Don't be so hard on yourself. With a

brain like yours, you could connive

with the best of 'em I bet.

MILO

He's buying up pretty much everything:

cable companies, baby bells, picture

libraries, museum rights, film

archives... Getting ready for Skywire.

LISA

(she's thinking)

What about "60 Minutes."

MILO

Yeah, they dig stuff like this.

(he types, then reads)

"CBS News has partnered with Outpost

Information Systems in a cable news

network due to launch Fall of 2001."

LISA

But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't

love to break something like --

MILO

(he's shaking his

head)

Say there's just one "mole" working

there, like Barton at the DOJ. How

do we know he's not the guy we've

contacted? Or she? Or the guy she

works for?

LISA

Time?

MILO

(types, reads)

Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake

in Gary's set-top device. That also

takes out CNN.

(scrolling & scrolling)

"GE joins Outpost in new venture,"

which means NBC is out. "Disney joins

Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and

Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out.

Any of these places could have a

mole. Or all of 'em.

(still scrolling)

It's like a a continuous loop. We

can go to some alternative press

place that 1,000 people read, get

them and us killed. But anything big

enough for this is a parent of or a

subsidiary to something Gary's got a

finger in!

HOMEWORK KID

Shhh.

MILO

Sorry.

LISA

Milo?

LISA

How close are you?

MILO

What?

LISA

He's got 12 satellites up. He's got

dishes on top of 21. He's building

this --

(gestures at the screen)

mega-network for Skywire. Let's use

it.

MILO

We can't just assume they're standing

by to receive Skywire 12 months from

launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.

LISA

A what?

MILO

It's how on-line services push logos

they wanna sell you. You don't ask

for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to

work on it somewhere besides my office

or my house. And then the quality of

the broadcast wouldn't exactly be

digital, that's 12 months away.

LISA

But they'd still get the idea, right?

MILO

You'd have to design a graphic

interface to make the data pop. Maybe

some audio, too. To tie it all in to

Gary. How long would that take you?

LISA

It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a

concept, it's maybe three day's work.

MILO

Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We

have to do this fast.

LISA

Before they kill somebody else, too.

MILO

(a new wrinkle)

Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's

house. To get the satellite positions.

LISA

You mean -- break in?

MILO

I don't know --

LISA

And what if the broadcast dishes on

top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said

the place isn't finished.

LISA

I'll go look.

(when he looks dubious)

They'll just have a few more pictures

of me snooping around.

MILO

(looks at her)

Why were you so careless?

LISA

I thought the worst they would do is

fire me. Who knew they took

termination so literally?

MILO

Why were you snooping in my office?

LISA

Oh.

(she gets bashful)

I liked you. I was checking you out.

MILO (O.S.)

'Think everybody in this place is

here the same reason we are?

LISA (O.S.)

'Cause their apartments might be

bugged?

MILO

I told Teddy about you.

LISA

What'd he say?

MILO

"A beautiful geek? What're the

chances?"

MILO

I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so

much" to Alice. But even then I was

starting to wonder. Is it so great

to be so consumed by this one thing

that you let another person do your

thinking for you? If you have a

lucrative skill, it's all anybody

wants from you. You grow older but

you don't grow up. You turn into --

into --

LISA

Gary.

MILO

Larry used to say how the guys who

wrote the first cool operating

systems, like the UNIX guys at

Berkeley? They just gave it away.

They figured it was human knowledge,

it belonged to the world, like

Shakespeare or aspirin. 'Know what

I'm gonna do after we broadcast the

incriminating stuff? Air the Skywire

code. Then nobody can have a monopoly.

ALICE

Where were you?

(holding his gaze)

You know you can't keep anything

from me.

MILO

Okay, yeah. I did something naughty...

There's this amazing Comix store in

Seattle.

(is she buying it?)

To tell you the truth, I did it once

or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't

keep anything from you...

ALICE

(she smiles)

I won't turn you in.

LEN

Every entry was authorized.

SHROT

Keep looking.

LEN

What're we looking for?

SHROT

Any irregularity in the pattern.

TV VOICE

Last years' party-goers pledged over

$2 million to the Museum; this year's

event promises to raise even more.

Lured in part by the chance to see

the stunning Boyd house...

MILO

Look at this.

ALICE

What?

MILO

Why doesn't he ask us to his party.

He's never even met you.

ALICE

He has thousands of employees, Milo --

MILO

It's for the Museum. He knows you're

a painter. If anybody should be

invited --

ALICE

Milo --

MILO

I know you think I'm too attached to

him, but still. I am close to Gary.

And you're the most meaningful person

in my life.

(he gets up)

I'm going back to the Comix place,

why should I be killing myself.

ALICE

Milo, you --

GUARD

Hey! Get down here!

MILO

This is a lifesaver. My PC crashed

just before finals.

SISTER BEATRICE

None of us knows how to use it. I'm

thinking of taking a course.

(she wants to look)

May I?

MILO

Sure.

SISTER BEATRICE

Forget it.

LISA

I needed t'see it up close for a

graphic. The outpost with a dish on

top? I climbed up there to get it

right.

SHROT

(hands back the drawing)

Next time you ask.

LEN

'Might of found something.

LEN

Delbert seems to enter #21 twice.

Without leaving the first time.

SHROT

Let's get him in here.

MILO

Great. I knocked off the aglet, as

soon as I get a passable version of

Skywire we're there.

LISA

The dishes are juiced up, too.

MILO

Thank God.

LISA

Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke

into #21. I was in his office when

he was reviewing the card readouts.

MILO

(confused)

They know I broke in. Alice helped

me.

(figuring it out)

Shrot's not one of them. He's

blundering into this on his own.

LISA

He doesn't know about the Day Care.

MILO

Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty

part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't

bother with it, it's accessed by a

tunnel they boast about. You know

the best place to hide a leaf?

LISA

Yeah, that's old, in a tree.

MILO

Oh.

LISA

Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody

entered the Day Care at four A.M.?

And tells them about it?

GARY

Milo?

GARY

I'm giving a benefit for the art

museum Thursday night. Thought you'd

like to bring Alice.

MILO

That's great! Thanks.

GARY

(as he goes)

'Sorry about the late notice...

DESI

"Sorry about the late notice?"

SHROT

Why did you enter #21 twice?

DELBERT

Huh?

DELBERT

This thing's screwed-up. Look here.

(shows it to them)

'Shows me going into the Day Care

that night. I never been in the Day

Care.

LISA

One window'll be obits I downloaded,

based on the scenarios you described.

The other windows'll accommodate the

surveillance stuff you told me about.

The idea is, this works with anything,

since we can't edit.

LISA

Same with the excerpts I'm choosing:

they'll play against any of the images

you described.

MILO

Perfect.

(something preys on

his mind)

How am I gonna get away from the

party long enough to --

LISA

You could always say you have to go

the bathroom.

MILO

That's lame, isn't it?

LISA

You'll come up with something.

ALICE

They called the house to ask who's

your favorite painter.

HOUSEMAN

Sorry, Sir, this part of the residence

is restricted.

GARY

Alice, I'm Gary. This is my wife,

Clarissa.

(handshakes, etc.)

Milo, this is Barry Linder, who's

visiting from Hollywood.

LINDER

I hate being the Hollywood guy. It's

so limiting. Meet my friend, Ricky.

RICKY

Hi, guys.

GARY

Barry's studio's gonna help fill the

Skywire pipeline, thought you guys

should meet.

MILO

(his mind elsewhere)

Cool.

SOCIETY WOMAN

He's a sweetheart. He gave 10,000

PC's to the Library Association.

SOCIETY MAN

All 10,000 of which will be signed

onto his browser, no doubt.

SOCIETY WOMAN

And so what?!

ANOTHER MAN

Wait'll all the books are on-line.

SOCIETY WOMAN

And so what?

LINDER

The merchandising implications are

epic. A kid's watching the movie, he

points and clicks at the laser blaster --

before the reel's even over he's

ordered the toy.

ALICE

But, I mean -- Devil's Advocate --

won't that influence the content?

Won't the artists complain? The

directors or writers or whoever?

LINDER

Artists? Darling, the only art left

in America is business. You're in

Picasso's house!

MILO

Where's the bathroom?

LINDER

The irreverence!

HOUSEMAN

You'll have to use one over there.

MILO

There's like eight women waiting in

line. They take forever.

(winces: painful

bladder)

Please?

HOUSEMAN

Right here.

GARY

(reading the screen)

"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working

with you. I'd be lying if I didn't

say I find you attractive. But in my

heart I know that Alice..."

(he looks up)

You left my party to send E-mail?

MILO

I couldn't do it at work cause of

security or at home for -- obvious

reasons.

GARY

You could've handwritten it.

MILO

I'm not much good at handwriting. Or

parties.

GARY

Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."

MILO

Gary, I'm sorry if I was rude --

HOUSEMAN

Everything OK, Mr. Boyd?

GARY

No problem.

(when he's gone)

Is there?

MILO

Gary, I --

GARY

You see what's hanging on the wall?

GARY

I hope you know what you mean to me.

Not just because of what you're doing.

Because of who you are.

MILO

I do know, Gary. I feel the same

way. I thought I was coming here for

a job. But it's meant a lot more.

GARY

When will you have a Beta version?

MILO

I'm pretty close. But when I wrote

the last contact switches, it wiped

out a piece of the content filer.

You know what it's like, writing

software.

GARY

I do know. You focus on the big

problem. But somewhere down the chain,

something breaks down. Something

gets destroyed. At first it's

upsetting. You feel you've lost

control.

GARY

So you have to remind yourself: it's

just the process. Something's always

lost along the way to anything

worthwhile. Some little bug, some

glitch. 'Can't get bogged down in

that, you're doing something other

people could never do. They lack the

imagination, the brain, the nerve.

Let them fret about every unforeseen

consequence. You have to solve the

problem. That's who you are.

ALICE

Are you gonna tell me where you went?

MILO

I went to see the Skywire model in

Gary's office. You know. Just to

hold it again.

ALICE

Are you having an affair, Milo?

MILO

No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody,

just now. To tell her how I feel

about you.

(looks at her)

You know I'm clueless, without you.

You know I --

ALICE

(fighting tears)

Just shut up?

LEN

Get the backslash, the colon, keys

kids don't use but geeks do.

(looking around,

perplexed)

What would Milo want in here, anyway?

SHROT

They know. 'Just they don't trust me

with it. So we'll get the evidence,

first, ask questions later.

LISA

Does he know you know?

MILO

He suspects I know something. I think

he was sort of -- explaining himself

to me, in case I do.

(he breathes)

We have to go in tonight. I'm two

hours from a Beta version.

(knows she won't like

it)

But I've gotta go home for an hour.

LISA

Why?!

MILO

She called to apologize. I said I

was pulling an all-nighter. She said

then come home just to say Hi. Which

I always do when we fight, it's

suspicious if I don't.

LISA

Please don't go.

MILO

At this point the worst thing I could

do is anything out of the ordinary.

LISA

Here's the interface.

ALICE

I'm a mess! I got this Hunan cookbook,

since we're always afraid for you to

eat in Chinese restaurants. I've

been mincing things into teeny-tiny

pieces all afternoon.

MILO

Great!

ALICE

Look at me! I'm gonna change.

MILO

(he smiles)

You look beautiful.

ALICE

Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.

MILO

...What?

ALICE

I know you. You're gonna run back to

work right after dinner. I want my

kiss now.

ALICE

Be right back.

ALICE

Milo?

ALICE

Milo?

MILO

Don't we have any chopsticks?

ALICE

Oh, right. Hold on.

MILO

(under his breath)

One more minute...

ALICE

Here we go.

MILO

Great.

MILO

...wanna savor this.

ALICE

It's gonna get cold.

MILO

Right. Wait. A toast.

ALICE

You're just afraid to eat it.

MILO

To the artist.

MILO

(his voice cracks)

It's great. It's great.

SECRETARY

Milo, hi! How was the party?

MILO

Great! Great! Thanks for asking!

LEN

You calling Phil and Randy?

SHROT

I'm calling Gary.

SHROT

He's left his office, we think he's

gone back to the Day Care for some

reason. Can you tell me why, Gary?

(he listens)

Whatever you say.

(hangs up angrily)

Wants to consult with Phil. Was it

Phil's idea to run the fingerprints?

SHROT

Come with me.

LEN

(trying to catch up)

Where we going?

PHIL

He's in the Day Care.

LEN

Bob, I'm a programmer, not a cop.

SHROT

What are you doing?

MILO

You're better off not knowing.

SHROT

What're you doing?!

MILO

They're surveilling programmers from

in here. They steal their code.

Sometimes -- I know this sounds insane --

sometimes they kill one.

MILO

They let me break into 21. 'Cause

there's nothing in there. You know

they've been keeping things from

you. 'Getting in the way when you

try t'do your job. That's why you

never told 'em your suspicions about

me. Right?

MILO

If you had I'd be dead now.

MILO

You've been following your gut all

along. Please don't stop now?

RANDY

What's going on here?

SHROT

Who're these guys?

RANDY

Where is he?

SHROT

We're too late. Take a look.

SHROT

What's in here worth taking, anyway?

RANDY

He must be out there still --

SHROT

(calling after)

Forget about it. His car's not in

the lot, he's gone!

VOICE

Hey!

DESI

Wanna get a cheeseburger or something?

MILO

Maybe another time.

RANDY

(to Shrot & Len)

Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to

leave here now.

SHROT

Wait a second. I'm the one who found

out he was mucking around in here in

the first place.

RANDY

We're all grateful for that. Really.

Go out the way you came in?

MILO

Meet me at the other location.

LISA (V.O.)

Tell me you're not calling on your

car phone?!

MILO (V.O.)

They know, I had no choice. Get out

of the house now! Do you have a

laptop?

LISA (ON THE PHONE)

It's three years old, it --

MILO (ON THE PHONE)

Bring it to the other location.

LISA

But you said the other --

PHIL

Yeah, alright.

(hangs up, briefs

Gary)

He's off campus, he's taken some

surveillance data with him.

PHIL

She's bringing her laptop, it's wired.

Second she boots up, we're on 'em.

RENT-A-GUARD

Help you?

MILO

Brian here? Brian Bissel?

RENT-A-GUARD

(picks up the phone)

Who wants to see him?

RANDY

(into the phone)

Nothing. They haven't booted-up yet.

MILO

This is the biggest Beta demo in

like the history of software. You'd

be my partner.

BRIAN

You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our

biggest show.

MILO

Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't

you? That's your dream in life.

BRIAN

Will I get to work for Outpost?

MILO

No. But you can write your own ticket

in the Valley after this. We're gonna

bring down Outpost.

BRIAN

What?

MILO

What'd they ever do for you?

BRIAN

Okay.

MILO

Great. Great! We need to drag a lot

of heavy stuff in front of the door --

BRIAN

What?!

MILO

(to the Rent-a-Guard)

Wanna be a part of history?

RENT-A-GUARD

Not really.

MILO

(digging in his pocket)

Well -- would you like to pick up an

extra -- 232 dollars?

PHIL

(on the phone)

Nothing yet, Gary...

RANDY

(into the phone)

We've got a fix on 'em.

(typing)

218 North Jericho Road.

RANDY

Public access TV station. KNQR.

PHIL

He's taken it to the public access

station.

GARY

That's what he was doing in here.

PHIL

Gary?

GARY

Help me change the Skywire settings.

Add five degrees to each satellite

coordinate.

PHIL

Gary, don't worry, we --

GARY

Just do what I'm asking!

BRIAN

You're interfaced with our dish.

MILO

(to Lisa)

Gimme the coordinates?

LISA

Longitude 77 degrees, 03 minutes, 58

seconds East.

LISA

Latitude 38 degrees, 55 minutes, 14

seconds South.

PHIL

19 seconds South. Altitude 431 Miles.

BRIAN

Is it your software?

MILO

Is it your dish?

LISA

Maybe it's the satellite.

MILO

(he thinks)

Let's try #2.

GARY

Okay, #2.

PHIL

Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --

LISA

They're already here. My laptop must

be wired!

BRIAN

(anxiously)

Milo?

MILO

(typing)

We're there.

MILO

Damn!

LISA

(to Brian)

You checked your connections?

BRIAN

(to Milo)

Yes! Should you reboot?

MILO

...He knows.

LISA

What?

MILO

He's been altering the coordinates

since we logged on. He's a step ahead.

Let's jump to #12.

PHIL

Ready for number three?

GARY

Let's go.

PHIL

Longitude 109 --

GARY

Wait... He knows.

PHIL

What?

GARY

'Knows I'm altering the coordinates.

Let's jump to #12.

PHIL

Gary?

GARY

Just do it.

GUNTHER

Step aside. We won't hurt you.

LISA

Latitude 47 degrees.

MILO

Wait a second. He knows I know.

BRIAN

What?!

MILO

He's working backwards, too.

(to Lisa)

Let's do number five?

LISA

Longitude 66.

LISA

Come now. They've got guns!

GUNTHER (O.S.)

Open the door, Milo!

BRIAN

(to Milo)

You there yet?

MILO

(typing)

One more second.

BRIAN

Hey, hey, relax, relax!

LISA

Oh my God.

BRIAN

(to Gunther)

Should I call Phil? Or do you?

BRIAN

Milo? Wake up. Our regular programming

will not be preempted tonight.

GUNTHER

(staring at Milo)

Wait.

BRIAN

...When did you know?

MILO

(still watching the

screens)

You should've called a few times to

bug me about your job prospects.

LISA

Milo? Who's got Skywire?

PHIL

If Milo didn't launch Skywire, who

did?

CUT TO:

SHROT

Now what are we doing? I don't get

any of this shit!

LEN

I launched Skywire. Just pray the

last set of coordinates Milo sent me

connected us to Gary's satellite.

CUT TO:

GARY'S VOICE OVER

Most of us who write software achieve

our greatest work before age 30. As

I grow older I know how important it

is to access fertile young minds!

RIMAN

(to Gunther)

You know the scenario for this.

MILO

'Last thing you wanna do is hurt us

now.

(not at all sure)

Right?

GUNTHER

(to Brian)

Who's seeing this?

BRIAN

(with dread)

Who isn't?

CUT TO:

GARY'S VOICE OVER

We work hard to stay ahead because

we know any kid working in his garage

can put us out of business.

GARY'S VOICE OVER

The first rule of the software

business is: those who don't innovate

are doomed to die.

GARY'S VOICE OVER

That's why we work so hard to invent

or acquire great new applications.

Consumers don't care where new ideas

come from, just so long as they're

offered at competitive prices. Isn't

that what the free market's about?

Sure, we like being #1, but it's

pressure, too. This business is

binary: you're a zero or a one.

JUSTICE DEPT. LAWYER

'Guess we should wake the Attorney

General.

GARY'S VOICE OVER

I've been called "aggressive" but to

me, that's really a compliment.

GARY'S VOICE OVER

Look at all the jobs and technologies

my "aggression" has created.

BARTON'S WIFE (O.S.)

Lyle? Phone for you.

GARY'S VOICE OVER

We really are a family here at

Outpost.

GARY'S VOICE OVER

I think that's why outsiders sometimes

sees us as "cultish" or "secretive."

Milo, It wasn't so bad, really.

XX "Alice"

GARY'S VOICE OVER

Is loyalty and group spirit somehow

"sinister" nowadays?

LAWYER

The "murder" stuff is all innuendo:

bad PR, legally null. 'Could probably

be spun as Urban Legend. There is a

case for corporate espionage, but if

you cop a plea, you'll get a slap --

GARY

Cop a plea? I'm confused, Ted. You

think I knew about this?

GARY

I'm running the company, fighting

the DOJ, raising a family. Randy and

Phil obviously overreacted. To this

endless, antitrust witchhunt.

LAWYER

(get real)

The government's gonna offer 'em a

helluva deal to tie you into this.

Whether you knew about it or not.

LAWYER 2

Randy, Phil and whoever else knew

about it.

GARY

That won't be a problem.

GARY (O.S.)

As for PR, Skywire'll take care of

all that.

GARY

The world's seen it now. They know

it's gonna dominate the convergence

market even beyond how Outpost '98

dominates the desktop.

GARY (O.S.)

Go after us, you give foreign

competitors a shot at the platform

that'll hold sway for 30 years: you

threaten not just our chip and PC

partners like when you came after

the browser.

GARY

You threaten TV networks, phone

companies, catalog outlets, publishing

houses, movie studios, travel agents,

airlines, stock brokerages -- you

sabotage the whole economy. Talk

about undermining innovation!

LAWYER 2

(he's writing on a

legal pad)

Easy to spin, old as the hills: What's

good for Outpost is good for America.

MILO

Come on, Bob. Load in the other disk.

GARY

"I had no knowledge of these

activities, but I have to ask myself

if the competitive environment I

encouraged in some small way

contributed --"

LAWYER

Gary?

SHORT FADE:

CYBER PUNDIT (OVER BLACK)

The Board ousted Gary Boyd as

Chairman, they're assisting the DOJ

in the breakup of Outpost into

divisions.

LARRY KING (ON TV)

That's gotta kill him, right?

CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV)

Outpost was his baby, sure. On the

other hand, we just learned Gary

Boyd owns the Skywire satellites.

Personally.

LARRY KING (ON TV)

Outpost doesn't own em.

CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV)

Conglomerates're lined up to finance

the launch of the remaining

satellites. They'll pay him a huge

premium to get on-line.

LARRY KING

That'd change with a criminal

indictment.

CYBER PUNDIT

There's no hard evidence he knew

about this. Anybody who could

implicate him seems to've vanished.

LARRY KING (ON TV)

Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling

this guy?

CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV)

Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you

some slack in this world.

LARRY KING (ON TV)

And the kid who wrote Skywire --

then gave it away? They're calling

him the digital Robin Hood.

CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV)

Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.

LARRY KING (ON TV)

We tried!

CYBER PUNDIT (ON TV)

You better believe everybody's trying

to sign him up.

MILO

Larry, Lisa.

LARRY

Your app kind of blew mine out of

the water.

MILO

(he shrugs)

We'll come up with the next big thing.

LARRY

...You wanna work -- here?

MILO

Got out of my other commitment.

LARRY

May I?

MILO

Hey, wait!

(when the Mover looks)

Not giving everything away.

LARRY

C'mon. Bring your stuff.

LARRY

You guys'll be using Teddy's old

space, is that okay?

MILO

Cool.

FADE TO BLACK:

THE END
