SOUTHERN MAN'S VOICE O.S.

Now these here are Brazilian, from Bahia.

Deep cuts. Damn good. These is India,

paler, but also good. And this is

Columbia. From them limestone caves up in

Muzo.

GRACE

Now them first two, you gonna get your

money's worth.

(re: COLUMBIA EMERALDS)

This one here's more expensive, but

that's 'cause there ain't a nigger flaw

in one of 'em. They hard as steel and

emerald green as emerald green fuckin'

comes. Lookit that.

BUD

That's nice.

GRACE

That's the real McCoy. That's what that

is.

BUD

Tell you what... Bag 'em all. The

market's got a hard-on for this shit.

GRACE

I hear that.

(across the room)

Jake, get on it.

NEWSCASTER

...And today, thirty-one year old Gary

Plauche pleaded innocent by reason of

insanity, to charges of second-degree

murder in the slaying of accused sex

offender, Jeffrey Doucett.

NEWSCASTER (TV)

...District Court Judge Frank Salia,

scheduled the trial one year to the day

after Doucett was first arrested.

BUD

What do you got there? Diamonds?

GRACE

That's thirty grand. Out the door. You

interested?

BUD

Ain't got the scratch right now. But I am

interested.

NEWSCASTER O.S.

...As a result of numerous threats made

weeks ago, tight security surrounded the

courthouse. However, missing from today's

hearing, was the arresting officer.

NEWSCASTER

From East Baton Rouge Sheriff's office...

NEWSCASTER O.S.

...Police Lieutenant, Bud Carter.

NEWSCASTER

Doucett was being extradited to Baton

Rouge.

NEWSCASTER

The victim's father, Gary Plauche, stood

waiting at the terminal. As Doucett

walked by, Plauche turned, raised a

handgun...and fired.

GRACE

Here you go. Fifteen three-karat blues.

Wholesale. Twenty large.

NEWSCASTER

Lieutenant Carter was unavailable for

comment.

RAY

Motherfucker, he's a cop.

SHEPARD

Fuck! Go! Go!

COBB

Think I broke a knuckle on that guy's

tooth.

SHEPARD

He only had one tooth.

COBB

Well I got it, didn't I?

MARANDINO

(to the bartender)

Another round, Sherry.

SHERRY

Comin' up.

MARANDINO

Bud, we all supposed to be celebratin'.

'Been workin' this case for months. And

you ain't said shit.

BUD

They had a lot of weight. Too much.

COBB

It's a ring. Organized burglary.

BUD

You saw them guys. You think that half

ass crew was organized?

MARANDINO

(laughs)

They shit their pants in unison.

COBB

What are you gettin' after, Bud?

SHEPARD

You think it was someone else's score.

BUD

I think its a part of somethin' bigger.

BUD

Tomorrow morning we put our friends under

the lamp. If they know this "someone

else", we'll know him too.

RAY

I told you... I keep tellin' you... I

don't know nothin'. That's it.

COBB

That's not it. We've been here all

morning. We'll stay here all night.

MARANDINO

The stones you were fencin' belonged to

an Amsec wall safe in "Kay's Jewelers".

The rest from a vault in Bocage. Both

owners can verify their belongings, and

have.

(beat)

Who you fencin' for?

GRACE

Man, I ain't sayin' fuckin' shit.

MARANDINO

Then your name's on a dozen other jobs,

just like it.

GRACE

That's bullshit.

MARANDINO

No, that's a promise.

COBB

We got a series of burglaries in the

area. All over the last six months. All

still open. You don't talk, it's on you.

RAY

Well I ain't got nothin' to do with that.

COBB

Any idea who does?

RAY

No! Okay? Fuck no.

MARANDINO

...Answer the question.

GRACE

(exploding)

MAN FUCK THIS! AND FUCK YOU! Y'ALL CREW'S

JUST FAGGOTS IN MATCHING JACKETS!

BUD

Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb

to be any more than a courier. I know

you're coverin' for someone else. NOW

TELL ME WHO THAT SOMEONE IS!

GRACE

I ain't a rat!

BUD

YOU AIN'T A RAT?!

MARANDINO

Easy, Bud. Go easy.

GRACE

(to Marandino)

STOP THIS SHIT! STOP HIM!

BUD

LOCK THE DOOR!

BUD

I'll teach you what commitment is... I'll

throw you in an eight by nine and have

you fucked in the ass by every inmate in

the state of Louisiana-- AND THAT'S THE

REST OF YOUR LIFE!

BUD

GIVE ME A NAME!

GRACE

(hacking)

He's from Whiskey Bay--!

BUD

--GIVE ME A NAME!!

BUD V.O.

Jesse Wheeler. Thirty-one.

BUD

Two tours in 'Nam. '69 and '71. He's a

jump marine. Weapons trained, explosives.

(turns the page)

Seven and a half out of a twelve year

stint for federal robbery. Two in Angola.

A year in DeQuincy. Three in El Reno with

a transfer to Lewisburg. Then Marion with

a brief stopover in Leavenworth. Released

from Oxford, 1981.

SHEPARD

Jacket's the size of the bible.

BUD

His stay at Marion, they kept him in "H"

block.

SHEPARD

H block? That's home to forty top murder

one inmates...

BUD

Yeah, life sentences. Jesse only had

twelve years.

BUD

He ain't just woodwork.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHEPARD

(waking Bud)

Target's out.

BUD

(into radio)

Alright. Give him room.

BUD

(into radio)

We're mobile.

SHEPARD

He's turnin' off.

BUD

Let's take him in the car.

(into radio)

Wait'll he's stopped. Watch your

backgrounds.

BUD

Don't move. You motherfuck, I'll blow

your head clean off.

BUD

Shut the car off slowly.

CUT TO:

SHEPARD

POLICE! WARRANT!

LYNN

GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!

MARANDINO

MA'AM, CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!

SHEPARD

WE GOT A WARRANT!

LYNN

(more dishes)

FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!

LYNN

Help... My baby...my baby...

BUD

(to Cobb)

CALL AN AMBULANCE! NOW!

BUD

Toss everything.

SMASH CUT TO:

COBB

Alright, I want everything seized!

MARANDINO

Motherfucker's got a general store.

SHEPARD

God damn...there's some weight.

BUD

I'm Detective Lieutenant Bud Carter, of

the East Baton Rouge Parish Precinct.

(smiles)

So how you like Baton Rouge?

JESSE

What happened to my wife?

BUD

Water broke. She's en route to the

hospital.

BUD

This is new.

BUD

What's the cyanide for, Jesse?

JESSE

Extracting impurities.

BUD

Impurities from what?

BUD

You're in a bad situation here, pal.

JESSE

I'll make bond.

SHEPARD

(top of his lungs)

OUT! EVERYONE OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT!

BRADDOCK

What more do you want? You got a two time

felon on multiple counts. You got

robbery, B&E, you got an all-you-can-eat

felony fuckin' possession. All on top of

an organized burglary ring.

INTERCUT:

BRADDOCK V.O.

The man's in custody, Bud. Fucked for

life. It's finished.

BUD

There's more, I know it.

BUD

Remember him? Ten months ago, a judge

gets popped with a .357. Well I got a

Ruger from Wheeler's toilet and rushed it

through ballistics.

BRADDOCK

And?

BUD

It's a solid match! Dead on.

BRADDOCK

There's a dozen ways Wheeler could've got

that burner. It don't prove a thing.

BUD

(drops another file)

A stack of bonds taken from the home of a

Baptist Minister...

BUD

Murdered. He and his wife. Looked like a

robbery gone to shit then; I want it

opened back up.

BUD V.O.

I still got tests pending. More guns.

More cases. This guy ain't crazy, Mike.

He's a ticket to somethin' big. Somethin'

happening now.

BRADDOCK

So who's backin' him?

BUD

I don't know; I do know they'll post his

bond. That's why I need a price they

can't come up with overnight.

BUD

I'm right about this, Mike.

(leans close)

When a guy's lookin' at two hundred years

and he ain't upset... It's like when your

wife is accusing you of fuckin' the

neighbor, but she don't know you're

fuckin' her sister too. You're pretty

calm about it, right?

BUD

It's 'cause we hit the wrong nerve. The

guns, the other shit, the time... He can

have that conversation. And he is. And he

ain't upset. He's makin' eye contact,

'cause we're fallin' short.

(the bottom line)

This guy knows things. He knows where

bodies are.

BRADDOCK

I'll bounce it up to the D.A.

JESSE

My name is Jesse Wheeler... I'm now in

charge of this cell. Any y'all don't like

it, step your black ass forward, line up.

CUT ABRUPT TO:

BUD

(answers)

Yeah...

MALE VOICE (OVER)

Bud? Charlie Bowers.

BUD

(into phone)

Charlie... You had an inmate in '75,

named Jesse Wheeler.

INTERCUT:

BUD

Charlie, you there?

CHARLIE

What's your interest in this guy, Bud?

BUD

Well, we got him on weapons and burglary.

But I got a feelin' there's more.

CHARLIE

Damn straight, a lot more. Race riots.

Smuggling. Extorting a guard. I had a few

run-ins with him myself.

BUD

What else?

CHARLIE V.O.

You could say this is where he peaked.

CHARLIE V.O.

He's a white supremacist. The worst kind,

if there is one.

CHARLIE V.O.

Came in on armed robbery and assault...

CHARLIE V.O.

But word in the system said, he's a

contract killer for the Aryan

Brotherhood.

CHARLIE V.O.

In here, the guy became an organizer...

CHARLIE V.O.

Controlling hits and movements inside the

system. Prison to prison. State to state.

CHARLIE V.O.

Between the Aryan Brotherhood and Neo

Nazis, he unified the front...

CHARLIE V.O.

All them prison gangs in the world...

Black Panthers, Mexican Mafia, forget it.

The AB is deadly as it gets. And Jesse

Wheeler was their ring leader.

BUD

So what the fuck happened?

MURPHY

Processing ain't open till morning. We

threw him in holding last night. 'Fore we

even turn around, it's like we're back in

the fuckin' Alamo.

BUD

He attack the guards?

MURPHY

Guards are fine. But he took on three

niggers like they stole from him.

MURPHY

I'll tell you somethin', Bud. After it

happened, our block was the quietest it'd

ever been. Wish we had ten just like him.

BUD

Open the door.

BUD

Heard you refused a public defender.

BUD

At the gas station...When you were

arrested, I put a gun to your head.

You expected someone else.

JESSE

You don't look like cops.

BUD

And your house? Guns. Mass supply tells

me, intent to sell. Cyanide in the

fridge, explosives...tells me you're

scared.

BUD

I know who you are.

JESSE

If you knew that much, you wouldn't be in

here alone.

BUD

One more thing, pal. I saw the judge this

morning.

(grins)

There is no bond.

DISSOLVE TO:

CATFISH

Grace? That you?

GRACE

Hey there, Catfish...

CATFISH

'The hell happened?

CATFISH

(smiles)

Oh... Excuse me.

CATFISH

So where you off to?

GRACE

Goin' to visit my mother. She's real

sick.

CATFISH

That's too bad. So you'll be gone a long

time then.

GRACE

Yeah...

GRACE

(swallows hard)

Buzz.

GRACE

What can I do y'all for?

CATFISH

How come the Wheeler brothers, is locked

up? And you ain't?

GRACE

Wheeler brothers is locked up? I don't

know nothin' about that.

CATFISH

I heard different.

GRACE

Well there ain't no "different" to hear,

Catfish. 'Cause I ain't talked to neither

of 'em.

CATFISH

But you did talk to someone.

GUARD #1

(calls out)

Open ninety-six!

CUT TO:

RAY O.S.

This place is bad...

RAY

There's eyes everywhere. Like I got a

sign on my back, Jesse, they all think I

talked.

RAY

Just the other day... some spic fish got

hit with a weight. Ten other cons, they

beat him and stabbed him till there

weren't nothin' left. And the guards let

it happen.

RAY

His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like

somebody painted 'em.

JESSE

They come at you?

RAY

Not yet... But it's in the mail. I can

feel it fuckin' coming.

RAY

Hey, Jesse...

(silence)

Sorry I put you back here. I never meant--

JESSE

(turns)

"Sorry", Raymond...? You ain't sorry.

(pause)

I took you into my home. I tried to clean

you up. And you steal from me...? You

take my fuckin' diamonds?

(dead to rights)

'Cause of you, I missed the birth of my

son.

BUD O.S.

Alright, let's work this...

(beat)

In prison, Wheeler is credited for the

expansion of the Brotherhood. When

Federal split up members, they had to

reorganize. So they tattooed their blood

types and serial numbers on one another.

COBB O.S.

Recede and multiply.

BUD O.S.

Exactly...

BUD

Put 'em in prison, they get stronger.

Everywhere you send one, they recruit in

numbers. Within five years, their numbers

were over ten thousand.

MARANDINO

Wheeler directed all that, huh?

BUD

What do you got there, Shep'?

SHEPARD

Interpol wired us files on three known

Aryan leaders in the state of Louisiana:

Edgar Bingham. Harold Kay. And this

man... Lucian Adams.

SHEPARD

High priest of the Aryan National Party.

His "ministry" of Christian Identity and

Paramilitary Order has stood for over a

decade. Check this out...

SHEPARD

Wheeler was just seventeen when he met

Lucian at the Patriotic Congress.

MARANDINO

No shit.

SHEPARD

Today, Lucian's one hell of an

entrepreneur. Owns surplus stores.

Demolition. A piping business. Got trucks

runnin' all across the God damn country.

BUD

Stay focused. Get back to Wheeler... I

need an angle.

COBB

For what? If Wheeler ever flipped, news

would spread like wildfire. The AB's

gonna know about it. They'd gonna know

about it nationally.

(re: his coffee)

Pass the sugar.

BUD

That's if he was a surface informant. I

don't want him to testify. I want to keep

him on the street.

(to the group)

Look, this guy's been in it a long time.

He's up to his elbows; wants to shake his

hands free. I can feel it.

MARANDINO

Braddock ain't gonna go for this.

BUD

I'll handle that.

BUD

We got one chance here. 'Cause if this

falls short... Jesse Wheeler's worth more

dead than alive.

CZAPP

How you doin', Ray?

(off Ray's look)

We was just over there wonderin' why you

ain't got the courtesy to introduce us to

your kin.

RAY

I was gonna.

CZAPP

(grins)

I'm sure you was.

CZAPP

Jesse Wheeler. Heard of you...

ROACH

Fuckin-A, heard a lot.

CZAPP

Name's Czapp... You can call me,

"Bossman."

(beat)

I kept an eye on your brother the past

few days for you. Ain't that right, Ray?

RAY

(low)

Yeah...

JESSE

My brother ain't none of your business.

CZAPP

Ain't none of my business, "Bossman." And

everything in this fuckin' place is my

business.

CZAPP

(to Jesse)

Listen to me, you sonofabitch. I'm gonna

make one God damn thing God damn clear.

Your reputation is smoke. Whatever they

say you is or once was, I don't give a

flyin' fuck. 'Cause it's my say-so now.

And your fuckin' brother's up for grabs.

CZAPP

Y'all got that?!

ROACH

(stumbles away, shocked)

Fuck...

MURPHY

WHEELER!!! Stand the fuck up! Hands

behind your head!

MURPHY

Hands behind your head! Get on the

fuckin' floor!

CUT TO BLACK.

DUTY GUARD

Phone call.

DUTY GUARD

It's a secure line.

JESSE

(into phone)

Yeah.

LUCIAN V.O.

Been a long time...

LUCIAN V.O.

Read about the arrest, Jesse. There's a

lot of heat on this one.

JESSE

I don't want my brother touched.

LUCIAN V.O.

(laughs faintly)

I ain't callin' about your brother. I'm

callin' about you...

LUCIAN V.O.

You should have come to me sooner, Jesse.

None of this would have happened.

JESSE

I'm askin' you, Lucian. My brother ain't

a problem.

LUCIAN V.O.

Your brother's a fuck up.

LUCIAN V.O.

And Jesse... We may know what you can do.

But you know what we can do. Understand?

BRADDOCK

You're reachin', Bud. The leverage ain't

there.

BUD

It's there. It's gotta cook a little

longer, that's all.

BRADDOCK

Jesse won't so much as blink at doin'

life. The fuckin' guy didn't rise in the

ranks 'cause he skirts under pressure.

(beat)

There's no deal to be had.

BUD

C'mon, Mike, you know what's goin' on.

Ray Wheeler compromised Jesse. By that,

he compromised the Brotherhood. Don't

tell me there ain't no fuckin' leverage.

BRADDOCK

We need somethin' more.

BUD

Well we ain't sleepin' till we find it.

LYNN

Life. You know how fuckin' long that is,

Jesse?

LYNN

So what am I supposed to do? Wait? Run?

(upset)

Your friends are comin' by the house.

Askin' questions, hangin' around. Waitin'

for the God damn phone to ring.

LYNN

You said we were done with this. That

they were out of our lives.

LYNN

We have no money, Jesse. Which means we

have no fucking food. ...Say something,

would you?

JESSE

It's gonna be okay.

LYNN

I'm afraid. I'm afraid for my life...

LYNN

(quietly crying)

...For our baby.

BUD

Lynn Wheeler. We haven't been properly

introduced. I'm Detective Bud Carter.

LYNN

I know who you are.

BUD

You have a ride home?

LYNN

We took the bus.

BUD

Take a cab.

BUD

'You need anything...anything at all. Be

sure to call me.

JESSE

Ray...

JESSE

Raymond, take a look.

TIME CUT:

DISSOLVE TO:

BUD

Want a cup of coffee?

JESSE

MOTHERFUCKER! This how you do things?

BUD

Yeah... When I want to talk to someone,

without giving the impression he's

cooperatin'.

BUD

You got a problem.

JESSE

Yeah, what's that?

BUD

To start with, you're lookin' at two

hundred years.

JESSE

I've done the time. I'll do it again.

BUD

I know you can do it. But can your

family?

BUD

Your brother's dead, Jesse. As we're

sittin' here now, he's on a slab at St.

Gabriel's Morgue. The coroner's callin'

it, "suicide". You and I both know that's

a load of shit.

(beat)

You do the time-- sure. And you never see

your kid. 'Cept in here. You can recruit

him. Your wife...plans...everything...

Gone.

(beat)

'Less you talk...to me.

JESSE

Do you hate?

BUD

What?

JESSE

Who do you hate the most? Blacks you

throw in prison?

BUD

...I dislike what they represent in the

system. Not as a whole.

JESSE

And you believe that by overthrowin'

Aryan nationalism and integratin'

races...polluted creeds, with us...You

believe you're solvin' somethin'?

BUD

I believe we survive by integrating

safety. Understanding hate, and how to

stop it.

JESSE

It ain't evil to fight it. It's evil to

tolerate it.

(leans in)

Maybe you forget that, to justify what

you do for a living...

BUD

Are we still in prison, or we back at the

compound, havin' mass?

JESSE

You don't get it.

BUD

No, don't dictate to me what put you in

here, or question my intentions with your

overcooked revolution!

(beat)

'Fact, I think you wanted out 'fore I

even got to you! That's why you distanced

yourself. That's why you're out there

crackin' safes. Lookin' to live a life

that ain't AB.

JESSE

In who I am, there's pressure! I work for

you, I won't need a lawyer, I'll need a

priest! My outside finance is gone... My

wife and son, their heads wind up

somewhere their bodies ain't! So tell me,

why the fuck should I get involved with

you?!

BUD

How about personal warranty?

JESSE

Warranty?!

BUD

Yeah, that's right! You've been a part of

the problem so long, you've forgotten

what the fuck that is!

(boaring in)

"Finance..." Your wife came here on a bus

to see you. I sent her home in a cab. Is

that your outside fuckin' finance?!

BUD

Let me give you a little insight, pal. As

to what I know... And what you think you

know.

BUD

This is today...

BUD

Is that your house? That's your wife,

right? Who's this guy?

BUD

(off Jesse's look)

Know where he's takin' them? Takin' your

family? I got a pretty good fuckin' idea.

BUD

Look at your wife, Jesse. Look at her

face. And your son. They look safe to

you?

(a moment)

I'm all you've got! I'm all your family's

got! And the longer you're in here,

they're up for grabs.

BUD

So either you let that happen... Or I get

the judge to allow bond. This never sees

trial. And you work for me.

BLACK.

JUDGE V.O.

Jesse Wheeler. Please rise...

JUDGE PONDER

You stand accused of forty counts of

burglary, twenty nine counts of felony

theft, possession of illegal firearms,

possession or dealing in unregistered

weapons, possession of a controlled

substance, manufacture and possession of

incendiary devices, and seventeen counts

of receiving stolen goods... How do you

plead?

KIERSEY

Not guilty, Your Honor.

JUDGE PONDER

Let's hear the arguments for bail.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY

Your honor, this man is an habitual felon

as well as a flight risk. Our office has

overwhelming evidence that Mr. Wheeler is

not only guilty, but also a serious

threat to the community. The State

recommends that bail be denied.

KIERSEY

Your honor, my client deserves a

reasonable bail. He has every intention

of appearing and answering to all these

false charges. In addition, he is the

sole provider for his wife and newborn

child, who would suffer undo hardship if

this man were incarcerated.

JUDGE PONDER

Bond is set at one million.

KIERSEY

Congratulations.

CUT TO:

JESSE

(answers)

Yeah...

JESSE

(into phone)

Okay.

MAN'S VOICE

How's your family?

JESSE

Let's get somethin' straight. I ain't

here 'cause I'm scared. I done what I

did, 'cause certain people crossed the

line. They didn't keep their word.

BUD

Well my word counts.

BUD

I want a body, Jesse.

JESSE

How many you want?

COBB

'The fuck is that?

BUD

Yard dog. Relax.

SHEPARD

Where's this motherfucker taking us?

JESSE

(directly to Bud)

Dig here.

TIMECUT:

MARANDINO

Bud! We hit something!

BUD

Clear it off! Come on, find the edges!

BRADDOCK

How long they been down there?

BUD

Jesse tells me six months.

BRADDOCK

Six months? Bud, they're biodegraded by

now. Fuckin' worm food.

BUD

We'll get an ID. Remember, we got the guy

who put 'em there.

CATFISH

'Bout time to get a new truck there,

Jesse.

CATFISH

Good to see you out. A free man now.

JESSE

What's goin' on, 'Fish?

CATFISH

On a Sunday drive, that's all. The good

Lord ridin' shotgun, through another

glorious Louisiana mornin'.

CATFISH

Say, Jesse... Lucian's askin' about you.

Fact, a lot of people are.

JESSE

You tell him I'll come by.

CATFISH

(no longer smiling)

That's good. I'll see you real soon then.

BUD

Hey, Mike.

BRADDOCK

Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch.

He's down from Washington. With the

Attorney General.

FITCH

Martin. Just call me Martin.

BRADDOCK

Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case

for a Federal sponsor.

BUD

How long you been with the Attorney

General, Fitch?

FITCH

Just over a year.

FITCH

I want to assure you my education and

experience is more than adequate to

handle a case of this potential.

BUD

Is that right...

BRADDOCK

Why don't we get to the particulars?

FITCH

Right. Alright.

(clears throat)

To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need

something substantial. A bait. In the

Justice Department, we have this mission

statement... We decide who the target is,

what's the threat assessment, the cost

value, over what time table it's gonna

take place... Which target do we go after

first. We don't want to miss a big target

hitting a smaller target, you understand?

BUD

No.

FITCH

Well, exposing bodies has limitations.

Those people are dead. We can't retrieve

their lives.

BRADDOCK

He means there might not be enough to

back Jesse.

BUD

Keep him on the street without

protection, he winds up dead.

FITCH

What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads.

He'll need to present something that

separates him from those we're going to

arrest. If Jesse can't offer something

continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of

much help.

WAITRESS

Ready to order?

FITCH

(cuts in)

Yes. I'll take a garden salad. Roquefort

on the side.

WAITRESS

You'll take what?

FITCH

(curt)

It's a dressing.

WAITRESS

Well...we got ranch, thousand island and

oil. Which one you want?

BUD

Lost my appetite.

BUD

I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds

want to help, that's fine. But not him.

BRADDOCK

What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's

not your partner, Bud. This case is

beyond our capacity. It requires

resources we don't have.

BUD

They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They

send us some kid with a year under his

belt?! He don't even know what state he's

in... You want him in charge?!

BRADDOCK

You're God damn right I do! You're out on

a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job

to make sure you get back!

BUD

This is bullshit.

BRADDOCK

That may be. What it ain't, is open for

discussion.

JESSE

Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I

could tell y'all things. Names.

Locations. What boat is movin' what

drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get

cut up and why. ...But what I got to know

is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear

your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's

right by me and keep my head from gettin'

shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is,

you need me. You ain't got enough cops

with enough sense or enough time, to

clear them crimes that already been

committed and will be.

(pause)

Y'all need me... I got the devil's

address.

FITCH

Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse,

for that. And thank you, everyone for

attending...

(tight)

Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve

a matter of custody--

FBI #1

We'll protect you and your family, Jesse.

(to the room)

It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those

bodies were transported over state lines.

ATF #1

Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This

man's house was a factory, for Christ's

sake. ATF is taking this.

DEA

Those murders were drug related. DEA's

got to do follow ups.

SECRET SERVICE

He was printing counterfeit money.

That's Secret Service.

JESSE

There's a hit list.

FITCH

Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone

quiet!

FITCH

A what?

JESSE

A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might

be one or two less now, I ain't sure.

Some could've already been gotten.

BUD

(to Braddock)

Now we're talkin'.

FBI #2

Why these twelve, Jesse?

JESSE

Different reasons. It ain't so much why

or what they done that matters. Pick any

one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on

salary.

JESSE

And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken...

You're Mr. Nokes, right?

JESSE

First U.S. Attorney, John Nokes?

NOKES

That's right.

JESSE

Well, last time I seen it...you was

number two on that list.

NOKES

Can you fill us in on the rest of those

names, Jesse?

JESSE

Yes, I can. But there's something I gotta

make clear 'fore that happens.

NOKES

What's that?

JESSE

I've listened to you, Mr. Nokes. And I've

listened to these suits here, on who's

gonna take me in...

(beat)

I will die, go to hell and take all y'all

cocksuckers with me, if he--

(motions to Bud)

--tells me to.

(beat)

I want y'all to know that.

NOKES

(to Bud)

How's that fly by you, Lieutenant?

NOKES

I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will

come out of our budget. Anyone has

pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me.

I'll loan him out.

NOKES

And, Jesse... I'm a little pissed I'm

number two on that list. Who the fuck is

number one?

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

BUZZ

Jesse.

JESSE

I'm here to see Lucian.

CATFISH

He's busy right now; You can come in and

wait.

MALE VOICE

This operation of your's has become big

business. You need relationships now more

than ever...

MORRIS

...We've done business successfully

before, Mr. Adams. But it's a larger

scope now. I'm here today because I want

to represent you exclusively. You need

someone lobbying at a state level, as

well as in Washington. My organization

can provide both. We've got contacts that

you don't have and other people can't

get. Now, I'm aware that you have

multiple businesses... However you need

one go-to guy, so that all your ventures

stay coordinated and all transactions and

contracts are realized. I am that person,

Mr. Adams. That's what I do.

KIERSEY

What's this going to cost us?

MORRIS

As a retainer, I want an advance of three

hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten

percent of whatever economic benefit I

bring to this organization.

KIERSEY

Three-fifty? C'mon, Dick. That's out of

line.

MORRIS

If you want a quality global economic

plan, that's what you pay for--

LUCIAN O.S.

We'll give you two, Mr. Morris...That's

what it's worth.

LUCIAN O.S.

The advance is a drop in the bucket. The

real money is the percentage. It's in

your interest to see it my way.

MORRIS

You've got a deal.

LUCIAN

(to Kiersey)

Give us a minute.

LUCIAN

You have a son now, right?

JESSE

Yeah...

LUCIAN

What'd you name him?

JESSE

I named him Ray.

LUCIAN

(over his shoulder)

Heard the cops smacked you around inside.

JESSE

'Wasn't too bad.

LUCIAN

You've been a busy man, Jesse. More ways

than one.

JESSE

Looks like you done just fine without me.

Business rollin' through the door.

LUCIAN

Last I saw you, you asked for time. Time

to raise a family.

Time to straighten things out.

(pause)

I gave you that time... Then safe jobs

start poppin' up. Lafayette. New Orleans.

Clinton. Baton Rouge. All over. The boys,

they think it's niggers, gone widespread

on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all

professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen.

Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect.

(locked on Jesse)

I knew right then and there, only a white

respectable burglar could've done this.

LUCIAN

Jesse... With all the work you been

doin': Diamonds. Emeralds. A dozen safe

jobs, behind my back...

(predatory)

Where's the tribute to the greater cause?

JESSE

Like I said, I just needed time.

LUCIAN

Well, even prophets stumble once in a

while.

LUCIAN

It's a shame about your brother.

LYNN

I don't understand. Why do we have to

leave the state? You're not tellin' me

something. You're not tellin' me a lot.

JESSE

It ain't safe here no more. You wanted

out? This is out.

CUT TO:

JESSE

Lucian took the stones. Talked about

jobs. High-end, boxcar.

BUD

Your family's safe now.

(beat)

Let's go to work.

CUT TO:

MONTAGE OUT/TO:

KIERSEY

There's a variety of matters to discuss

today, gentlemen. Eddie Moran's trial

starts next week. One of the jurors

reached out. He's asking six thousand up

front plus a job at four hundred a week.

That guarantees a hung jury with a push

for an acquittal.

LUCIAN

Three hundred. Give him a no-show at the

trucking firm.

KIERSEY

(as he writes)

Construction on the building Morris

brought us, in south-east Florida, is

complete. Every unit sold. We should see

revenues of one point four million over

our original projections.

KIERSEY

Lastly, our "friends" from the Middle

East. They put a final offer on the

table. They'll fund our operation in

Louisiana if we agree to act on their

behalf. Political targets mostly, on the

basis of our approval...

(beat)

I advise we do a test case. Perhaps a

sample of their resources.

LUCIAN

"Final offer?" Demands...

(beat)

Close the deal. We'll cook the cash for

it. By the time they realize, we'll have

our return.

(laughs to Jesse)

You believe they're travelin' all the way

to Louisiana just to get fuckin' robbed?

CUT TO:

LUCIAN

I want you runnin' point on this one...

JESSE

I'll be honest, I was hopin' for

somethin' bigger.

LUCIAN

What do you got in mind?

JESSE

How 'bout a few of them heads off the

list?

LUCIAN

We got guys for that now. Catfish, Buzz.

What do you want to go back to that for?

JESSE

The money's worth twice this. Bring back

a head it's fifteen grand; Bring a heart,

it's thirty, right?

LUCIAN

Tell you what. Do this other thing we got

lined up...

(beat)

Then I'll give you that taste.

FITCH

There's pressure from Washington. They

send compliments for Jesse's work. But

our primary concern is that list. I need

names we can protect.

BUD

We know that, Fitch. He's workin' on it.

FITCH

If Jesse can just get a direct order...

from Lucian to him, on a wire--

BUD

--A wire?! He just went back to work, you

want him to wear a fuckin' wire?

(beat)

Put a tap on that God damn lawyer's

phone, that's what you should do.

FITCH

He's an attorney, Carter. Anything we get

would be inadmissable.

BUD

It's information, Fitch.

FITCH

Bud. We need Jesse to engage Lucian on

the record. Otherwise it's just hearsay.

He's disconnected from everything, like a

ghost.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

JESSE

Catfish.

CATFISH

Go 'head. Count it.

NASEEM

There a problem?

JESSE

No problem. Money's all there.

CATFISH

'The fuck you lookin' at...?

JESSE

(low)

Catfish, would you shut the fuck up? This

ain't the time.

NASEEM

(to Catfish)

Yes, listen to your boss.

CATFISH

What?! What fuckin' "boss?" You best

watch your ass, sand nigger.

NASEEM

Piece of shit--!

JESSE

Take it easy! Take it easy!

A VOICE

(over a loud speaker)

ATF! THE PERIMETER'S SURROUNDED!

CUT TO:

TIMECUT:

JESSE

You're a piece of work, Catfish.

CATFISH

Them niggers crossed the line...I had to

burn 'em--

JESSE

--You had to keep your mouth shut! On a

job, you don't do fuckin' shit 'less I

say!

CATFISH

'The fuck off me--!

JESSE

(low, deadly)

Fuck me up again, you hear me? I'll leave

you where I find you. Got that?

JESSE

Unload the fuckin' truck.

FITCH

Keep your voice down! This was out of my

control!

BUD

I'm telling you, your agents best pull

their shit together! Who the hell y'all

trying to protect?!

FITCH

Look, Carter. This is a joint task force

with multiple agendas, that run up the

chain of command through me. Intel came

forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem

Kazuri - an international arms dealer -

would be present at this meet. ATF was

tasked to observe and report.

BUD

That ain't what they did--!

FITCH

--No! Because your informant--

BUD

My informant, that's right!--

FITCH

--Your informant and his psychopath crew

greased half our political interests --

over a bag of fake cash! You weren't

informed, so what?

BUD

Well I better be informed! 'Cause this

ain't fallin' short! Now, any of y'all

got a collaborative agenda in the works?

I want to see it. These other agencies,

what time-lines they lookin' at? What

deadlines and why?

FITCH

Above your pay-grade--

BUD

(overlapping)

And is there a purposeful lack of

communication between competing agencies,

who are right now charting future

mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?!

FITCH

That's not your concern, Carter!

BUD

We're not talkin' about me!!

BRADDOCK

Bud!

BUD

(spins)

What?!

BRADDOCK

You're over-involved here.

BRADDOCK

I'll handle this.

FITCH

Thanks for coming down, Mike. He's been

berating my agents for the last hour.

FITCH

We're trying to band-aid a situation

here, and frankly, Carter's preference

for thug tactics isn't helping. It'll all

be in my report...

BRADDOCK

(interrupts)

"Isn't helping?"

BRADDOCK

"Isn't helping?" Let's not miss what

happened here, Fitch. We work for the

same cause doesn't mean we work for you.

What are you gonna do now? Send Jesse

back out? Earn his trust? Bud Carter

delivered the biggest informant in the

history of this state to your lap, and

you and the people you work for are gonna

let it go to shit.

(beat)

You can expect that will be in my report.

CUT TO:

MORRIS

Look. I had no previous knowledge of any

business with Muslims. So if stealing me

here in the middle of the night, is some

kind of accusation--

LUCIAN

I'm not accusing you, Mr. Morris. But I

do find it interesting that right about

the time I employ you, my operation

starts having problems.

MORRIS

Yes, but--

LUCIAN

That is interesting...isn't it?

LUCIAN

I want to know if this was an isolated

incident. If the ATF impeding on my work

is the result of a deeper threat.

MORRIS

What are you suggesting?

LUCIAN

I'm suggesting you contact your friends

in Washington.

MORRIS

With all due respect, Mr. Adams, that's

not what I was retained for.

LUCIAN

Well now it is.

MORRIS

That sort of information requires

clearance I don't have. If I start

sniffing around, people are going to ask

questions.

LUCIAN

I'm asking questions, Mr. Morris. And I'm

getting impatient.

LUCIAN

You don't leave here till I get answers.

CUT TO:

LYNN V.O.

(clearly asleep)

Hello...

JESSE

It's me.

LYNN V.O.

You okay?

Honey, you alright?

JESSE

I'm okay. Just need to hear your voice.

How's little Ray...?

LYNN V.O.

I'll put him on.

LYNN V.O.

It's daddy on the phone, say hello.

LYNN V.O.

Jesse?

BUD

Where the hell you been?

(Jesse's look)

Two days missin', you broke protocol.

Three, and you're a flight risk.

Agents'll hunt your ass down.

JESSE

(anger spiking, pacing)

I can't keep doin' this. I can't fuckin'

breathe. Even the shadows got eyes.

BUD

This is the job. If I don't hear from

you, I can't protect you.

JESSE

(in his face)

Protect me?! I about got my head fuckin'

shot off, 'cause your guys was

"protecting" me!

BUD

Those ain't my guys!

JESSE

I don't give a fuck-- I don't want your

protection! I want out!

BUD

There is no "out." Not for either of us.

Not till it's done...

(low, definitive)

Get me that list.

CUT TO:

BUD

I'm losin' him, Mike...

BRADDOCK

Just relax. We gotta let things settle,

that's all.

BUD

It ain't gonna settle, it's gonna blow. I

can feel it.

BRADDOCK

What do you want me to do?

BUD

Push 'em back.

BRADDOCK

Who?

BUD

The Feds. All these suits, fuckin'

outsiders. Everyone. Get me some room.

Some time to reel this thing in.

BRADDOCK

I'll talk to Nokes. 'See what I can do.

BLACK.

MORRIS

There's an investigation underway, funded

by the U.S. Attorney. And you're the

target.

MORRIS

They're receiving assistance from both

the ATF and FBI, who are stationed right

here in Henderson.

LUCIAN

(pause)

How long they been active?

MORRIS

My sources tell me three months.

LUCIAN

Three months...

KIERSEY

(reading)

This is U.S. Attorney John Nokes, at the

helm. He's been after us for years.

LUCIAN

Who they got for a mouthpiece?

MORRIS

A "mouthpiece"?

LUCIAN

Who's the rat in the woodpile? Who the

fuck's giving 'em information?

MORRIS

I couldn't dig that deep. But it's

someone close.

(pause)

I suggest you gentlemen disband.

Immediately.

KIERSEY

Lucian...

LUCIAN

Yeah.

KIERSEY

The investigation's local point is a

detective out of East Baton Rouge.

(beat)

His name's Bud Carter.

CUT TO:

LUCIAN

Couldn't sleep.

JESSE

Got somethin' on your mind?

LUCIAN

(without looking at him)

There's been an adjustment to the list,

Jesse...

LUCIAN

We got this...heathen. A whore of an

Irishman...down in Baton Rouge.

He's protected. Got a lot of guys around

him. That's why it pays. That's why

nobody wants the job... That's why we're

here talkin'.

JESSE

Who is it?

LUCIAN

This cop... he's got a mouthpiece...

somewhere. Ain't yet figured out who.

In the meantime, shut him down.

JESSE

It's done.

'made a pulled-pork sandwich.

CATFISH

Fuck you, man! This don't feel right.

in the right forearm. We have most of it

removed. Two fingers are gone. A portion

of the palm. There's no chance of

reconstruction.

(Bud's silence)

I'll be monitoring his vitals.

BRADDOCK

(stares for a moment)

You have to let go now.

BRADDOCK

It's over.

BUD

It's not.

BRADDOCK

There is no family.

This is an atrocity, gentlemen.

Incompetence at it's highest level. I

handsome face of mine...can't step foot

in Washington, for fear of being laughed

off the Hill.

NOKES

Now, I'd love to point to Local on this.

But truth is, they've carried their

weight. We are federally fucked...

(looks right at Fitch)

Because Federal fucked up.

NOKES

So. Best idea wins, gentlemen. Chain of

command? Point of procedure? I don't give

a fuck. That's out the window, just like

our informant...

eight hours now. It's clean. Whatever's

he's up to, Bud, it ain't comin' through

the front door.

FITCH

Carter! We need to talk.

BUD

Get out of my way, Fitch.

FITCH

(following Bud)

This is my investigation. Jesse's cowboy

bullshit is not how it's done!

BUD

While your agents build their cases and

set for court, he'll erase the debt owed

to all of you. Overnight.

FITCH

So you're implying I should thank him?

FITCH

Look, Carter, whether we like it or not,

you and I have to work together on this.

We entice Jesse back. I'll get him full

protection, if he agrees to testify.

BUD

That'll never happen.

FITCH

Why the hell not?!

BUD

(turns)

'Cause it's over, Fitch. It's done. He

has nothing. Why do you think he lit that

fire? To plant a flag. To let us know he

doesn't need our protection. Doesn't want

it. He would've just left 'em for dead.

FITCH

For God sakes, listen to me! I'm not

taking the fall for this! The plan is--

BUD

No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got

balls big enough to relate to this guy.

If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be

in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in

this situation. And you wouldn't be

askin' stupid fuckin' questions!

(walking away)

I'll bring him in myself. Just keep your

agents off my ass.

DISSOLVE TO:

KIERSEY

OPEN THE TRUNK! PLEASE! OPEN THE TRUNK!

BUD

You know who the fuck I am?!

KIERSEY

YES!

Who's Richard Morris?! Why was he killed?

BUD

I'll break every fuckin' bone you got.

Start talkin'.

KIERSEY

I can't-- I can't--

BUD

Can't what?! What can't you do?!

BUD

You piece of shit, talk!

KIERSEY

(hysterical)

He made Jesse...The investigation...

Everything...

BUD

His family?

KIERSEY

Everything! After that, he was just a

loose end!

BUD

Where's Lucian Adams?

KIERSEY

I don't know!

BUD

Lucian's goin' down. You either go down

together, or you give him to me.

KIERSEY

(a mile a minute)

I never talk to him directly! I swear,

they page me--

KIERSEY

--Every night at five, for a six o'clock

call! They page from different numbers!

MARANDINO

He's in the French Quarter. All numbers

paging Kiersey between five and six p.m.,

the last seventy-two hours, are pay

phones within a three mile radius.

BUD

Alright.

COBB

Bud, you gotta talk to Braddock. He's

lookin' for you, he's fuckin' pissed.

BUD

Hold him off. I'll square it with him

when I get to the Quarter.

JESSE

I'm gonna ask questions...

JESSE

When I'm satisfied with your answers, I'm

gonna kill you. How long it takes and how

much blood you want to spill...that's up

to you.

CATFISH

What do you want to know? Want to hear

about your brother? How we had him shot

up with strychnine? How he died slow

death?

CATFISH

OH, YOU SONOFABITCH!!!

JESSE

Four days ago, my wife and son were

killed.

(pause)

I hear you took the contract?

Detective "Lieutenant." Now how can I

help you?

How long till you make an arrest in your

investigation of Lucian Adams?

KIERSEY

I'm willing to provide you with documents

and information to secure his conviction.

BRADDOCK

Why?

Why do you think? I'm afraid for my life.

Don't know yet. I got Harold Kay so far.

Looks like they own the God damn block.

BRADDOCK

Well I got Kiersey just walked in. Two

fractured wrists and scared as all hell.

BUD

I can explain--

BRADDOCK

He wants to make a deal, Bud. I can keep

Nokes in the dark twenty-four hours, but

that's it.

Two men flanking. Drivers have not left

the cars. Initial perps still on post.

Lucian's entering the building...

MARANDINO

(into radio)

I need eyes on a single, white male

crossing Esplanade. Possible intent...

BUD

(beat, into radio)

It's Jesse...

COBB V.O.

(quickly, radio filter)

He's heading toward the alley, Bud. We

take him down?

BUD

Let him go.

COBB V.O.

What?!

BUD

(firm)

Let him go.

COBB V.O.

Bud, that's crazy! Jesse goes in first,

he's gonna blow this whole thing. We

can't let that happen.

BUD

(intense, into radio)

That's exactly what we're gonna do! We

got no way inside. Let Jesse go in hard

and draw fire. He pushes Lucian out to

us. Stand the fuck down. I'm on my way.

MARANDINO

(into radio)

I don't see him. I got nothin'...

MARANDINO

Fuck!

Want a cup of coffee?
