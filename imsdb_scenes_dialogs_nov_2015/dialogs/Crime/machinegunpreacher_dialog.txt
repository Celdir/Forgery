LYNN

He don't care what kinda shoes you

14

PASTOR KRAUSE

The point of receiving God's word is

life. Life upon life. And to accept the

blood of Jesus is life upon life upon

life...

CONGREGATION

Praise be to God!

PASTOR KRAUSE

He breathes his spirit into darkness and

makes something good. He sees our shadow

and says, `let there be light!"

CONGREGATION

Amen!

PASTOR KRAUSE

... now proclaim his saving grace! If

there are sinners here looking for God

raise your hands!

PASTOR KRAUSE (CONT'D)

Stand up! Receive Jesus Christ as your

light and saviour...

FRONT ALTAR

PASTOR KRAUSE (CONT'D)

Receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour...

in the name of the father and of the son

and of the Holy Ghost...

SAM

You need me to stay on, I can.

CONTRACTOR

LYNN

SAM

LYNN

16

WOMAN

I got somethin in Pitt, but you gotta

have some college for that.

SAM

I'm a hard worker and I learn real fast.

WOMAN

But you got no education, Mr. Childers.

MECHANIC

... don't deal bikes. Probably have a

better shot if you take it over to Pitt.

Or maybe down to Philly.

SAM

I gotta sell it today.

MECHANIC

Give you four hundred for it.

SAM

There's almost two grand on this bike.

Them pipes right there is custom. You

wont see pipes like that on anything

round here.

MECHANIC

Like I said, don't deal bikes. I'll give

you four-twenty. Cash. Best I can do.

SAM

(READING)

"Into the street the Piper stept, smiling

first a little smile, then three shrill

notes the pipe uttered like a great and

mighty army muttered..."

PAIGE

What's uttered?

SAM

Like spoke up, made a sound.

17

PAIGE

Okay, keep goin.

SAM

(turns the page)

And out of the houses the rats came

tumblin, black rats, brown rats, brother

rats, sister rats, and husband rats

followed their little rat wives... Til

they came to the ragin water where they

drowned and lost their lives."

PAIGE

They got rid all them rats?

SAM

Yep.

PAIGE

How come you sold yer Harley?

SAM

Cause it's what I had to do.

SAM (CONT'D)

DONNIE

Well, well, well, wondered when I was

DONNIE

18

SAM

DONNIE

(TO SAM)

You want somethin?

DONNIE (CONT'D)

You know that old Indian didn't die out

there that night. Story in the Lehigh

Valley News bout it. Somebody picked that

poor bastard up after us, took him to the

emergency room, you believe that shit?

SAM

God was lookin out for us both, I

suppose.

DONNIE

Well then, here's to him.

(DRINKS)

Didn't hear you pull up.

SAM

Got Lynn's car.

DONNIE

She broke down on ya?

SAM

Sold her.

DONNIE

Ahhh, shit, man. Shoulda come to yer ole

buddy first.

SAM

Sorry I'm late.

19

SAM (CONT'D)

SAM (CONT'D)

SAM (CONT'D)

PAIGE

SAM

I'm thinkin of a snail... you hear me,

Bug?! Snail.

21

PAIGE

SAM

Good job, Bug, good job! You said whale,

I'm thinkin of a pail!

PAIGE

You said pail, I'm thinkin of a tail.

CONTRACTOR

SAM

CONTRACTOR

SAM

Yep.

CONTRACTOR

good.

SAM

We're alright.

CONTRACTOR

Damn twister touched down eight places

between here and Noblesville. Chewed up

six hundred homes in Fulton County alone.

(BEAT)

Got all the work you can handle if you're

interested.

SAM

I'm interested...

22

SAM (CONT'D)

But I'm puttin my own crew together. We

go 50/50 on the jobs. You cover any heavy

machines I need.

CONTRACTOR

Then we'll go half.

SAM

You got a deal.

PASTOR KRAUSE

Today we are blessed with a special

guest. It's my pleasure to welcome Pastor

Relling from the Kilangire Christian

Ministry in Uganda, Africa. Pastor...

BEGINS --

RELLING

Thank you Pastor Krause, and thank you

brothers and sisters for inviting me into

this house of the Lord.

(BEAT)

I'm here today to talk to you about your

Christian brothers and sisters, families

just like yours, a half a world away that

desperately need your help...

25

LYNN

Paige, go get some more beans.

LYNN (CONT'D)

What are you thinking?

SAM

Thinking about Africa.

PAIGE

They have tigers over there?

SAM

(JOKINGLY)

They eat people!

LYNN

What about Africa?

SAM

Just thinkin bout that fella today.

PAIGE

He talked funny.

LYNN

Just from a different place than us,

baby, that's all.

SAM

Was thinkin maybe I'd go over there. Help

em out fer a few weeks.

26

DAISY

Africa?

PAIGE

To see the tigers.

SAM

He was talkin about puttin box beam roofs

on school houses over there.

LYNN

What about finishing that job in Boswell?

SAM

I'll only be gone a few weeks. Be back

before you know it.

SAM

You Ugandan Army or what?

DENG

SPLA.

SAM

What's that?

DENG

Sudanese People's Liberation Army. We are

freedom fighters.

SAM

Name's Sam Childers.

DENG

I am Deng.

27

SAM

(re: Deng's weapon)

Givin ya problems?

DENG

Yes. A bit.

SAM

Double-feed?

DENG

Sometimes.

SAM

Lemme have a look...

SAM (CONT'D)

Yer mag is tight. See here...

(INDICATING)

The loads are feedin right to the barrel

face. That's yer problem...

SAM (CONT'D)

... you need this plate to ramp into the

chamber... that way yer brass won't get

stuck...

(FINISHING)

... there ya go, should be better...

DENG

Thank you.

SAM

No problem.

DENG

Are you military?

SAM

No, not me. I ain't the military type.

Ain't so good with bein told what to do.

DENG

When did you learn about weapons?

28

SAM

Long time ago. Different life.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey Childers...

DAN

Some of us are going into Kampala

tomorrow night. Find ourselves a little

fun this weekend. You in?

SAM

I was thinkin bout goin up north.

DAN

You crazy? There's a civil war going on

up there.

SAM

I know.

SAM

Hey, Deng, you wanna Coke?

DENG

Thank you.

SAM

Got a question for ya.

DENG

Yes?

SAM

I wanna go into Sudan this weekend. Need

someone to show me around. You

interested?

DENG

The others are going into Kampala.

29

SAM

That ain't my speed no more. I wanna see

some country.

DENG

You want to see?

SAM

They always drive this fast?

DENG

Traveling is the most dangerous time in

Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open

road it would be very bad.

SAM

You got kids, Deng?

DENG

No. I have no children.

SAM

Where you from?

DENG

A little village called Aweil. Many hours

from here.

SAM

That's where your family is?

DENG

My family was killed by LRA.

(BEAT)

Unyama is about two hours from here. We

will stop there for lunch.

30

DENG

The Muslim North has tried to kill the

Christian South for 30 years. Two million

have lost their lives...

DENG (CONT'D)

... these people have been driven from

their villages, however these camps are

not much better...

DENG

Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there

is little food and not enough UN soldiers

to protect everyone. Even here they worry

the LRA will attack at night.

SPLA SOLDIER 1

(ARABIC)

Are you from Kitgum?

DENG

(ARABIC)

Yes.

SPLA SOLDIER 1

(ARABIC)

Someone wants to speak with you.

31

DENG

I'm sorry, Sam... I'll be five minutes.

SAM

Course, do what you gotta do.

AGNETE

Excuse me. You. Can you help please?

AGNETE (CONT'D)

We need to transfer her to the bed. Get

her shoulders...

AGNETE (CONT'D)

One, two, three...

SAM

What happened to her face?

AGNETE

The rebels cut off her lips because she

argued. These are Kony's orders.

SAM

Who's Kony?

AGNETE

Who are you with?

SAM

I'm with Deng over there.

32

AGNETE

What organization are you with?

SAM

Working with a Christian group down

South. Just up here takin a look around,

seein a bit of the country.

AGNETE

This isn't a tourist destination, this is

a war zone. You stay in this area, you'll

be killed.

(BEAT)

Thank you for your help.

DENG

Some say Joseph Kony is a wizard. A

shapeshifter. He calls himself a

Christian...

DENG (CONT'D)

... but I say he is Satan, who devours

his own people.

SAM

Kony is the leader of the LRA?

DENG

He is the one we have been fighting for

years. But there is very little we can

do. Our weapons are old, and our boots

are full of holes. We have been forgotten

by the rest of the world.

33

DENG (CONT'D)

Why are you here?

SAM

S'cuse me?

DENG

What are you looking for in this place?

SAM

Ain't lookin for nuthin.

DENG

And then you will get your picture and go

back to your life and all this will just

be a story you tell your friends.

DENG

They are night commuters. They come from

deep in the bush. Their parents send them

out because it is safer to sleep here

than in their own homes.

SAM

Why?

DENG

Because death comes at night in the

villages and refugee camps.

DENG (CONT'D)

These are the lucky one so far. The ones

the rebels have not found. The invisible

children.

34

DENG (CONT'D)

Where are you going?

DENG

(CALLING AFTER)

Sam...

SAM

Get up... let's go...

SAM (CONT'D)

Come on...

DENG

What are you doing?

SAM

They ain't sleepin out here. Tell em

they're comin inside.

(to children on the ground)

Ya'll get up... let's go...

DENG

Sam, there are too many...

DENG (CONT'D)

... you can't help them all.

SAM

I can help these here.

35

DENG

(ARABIC)

Settle down... it's alright... you can

sleep here till morning...

CUT TO:

DENG

The LRA attacked a village last night.

DENG (CONT'D)

You said you wanted to see.

36

37

PAIGE

You see any tigers over there?

SAM

Naw, didn't see no tigers.

PAIGE

But they do have them over in Africa.

SAM

So I hear, but not where I was.

PAIGE

Sure am glad you're home.

SAM

Me too, bug.

PAIGE

I'm thinkin of a plane...

SAM

It's late, you better get to bed...

38

PAIGE

C'mon, plane... I'm thinkin of a plane...

SAM

You said plane, I'm thinkin of a train...

PAIGE

You said train, I'm thinkin of a brain.

SAM

You said brain, I'm thinkin of a...

(HESITATING)

PAIGE

Gotcha!

SAM

Ok, you got me.

PAIGE

You coulda said drain, or mane... like

horse's hair.

SAM

Sweet dreams, bug.

LYNN

You comin to bed?

SAM

In a bit

LYNN

You ok?

SAM

Just a long flight.

39

LYNN

Baby, whatcha doin?

SAM

Makin plans.

LYNN

You been to bed yet?

SAM

I had a vision last night, Lynn. Crazy as

it sounds, God spoke to me...

SAM (CONT'D)

I'm gonna build a church.

LYNN

A church?

40

SAM

Right across the street. Not like Faith

United or Calvary Fellowship. Place that

ain't gonna turn you away if you a drug

addict or a prostitute or whatever. Place

for sinners, just like me, who wanna hear

the word of God.

LYNN

How we gonna pay for a church, Sam?

SAM

We got money in the bank. Business is

good. Besides, I own a construction

company...

(SMILING)

I'm gonna give us one heck of a good deal

on the build.

LYNN

Yer crazy.

SAM

`Lil bit.

LYNN

What's that?

SAM

That's the orphanage I wanna build. In

Sudan.

CUT TO:

41

VOICE (O.S.)

Sam Childers...

SAM

That's me.

BIKER

Hey bro, Ben Hobbes, knew each other long

time ago.

SAM

Yeah, Ben, how you doin?

DAUGHTER

Daddy, I'm gonna go.

BIKER

OK, sweetie...

BIKER (CONT'D)

Goddamn, they grow up quick, don't they?

SAM

Sure do.

BIKER

Hey, nuthin fer nuthin, Sam, but rumor

has it you was puttin up a chapel over

there in Central City.

SAM

That's right. Gonna minister to anybody

who's lookin for The Lord.

BIKER

That's good, man. Maybe you can do

somethin bout your old friend, Donnie.

SAM

What about em?

BIKER

He ain't doin so good, bro. But hey, good

seein ya' man.

42

SAM

I'm here for that boy right there. You

gonna get in the way a that?

DONNIE

I can't do this.

SAM

Look at me. God don't make trash, boy.

Now he ain't givin up on you, so don't

give up on him, you hear me?

43

DONNIE

Welcome to Shekinah Fellowship Church.

LYNN

It's five-til and he still ain't here.

SAM

You call him?

(LYNN NODS)

Try him again.

DAISY

You like this dress, Sam?

SAM

What, mom?

44

DAISY

You ain't never seen this one. I bought

it a long time ago. Been keepin it for a

special occasion.

SAM

It's nice.

DAISY

I never told you this but when I was

pregnant with you, now this was way back,

probably 1960, when yer daddy and I was

still in Grand Rapids, a Pastor

prophesied over me. Pulled me right up on

stage and laid his hands on my belly and

told me I was gonna have a Preacher for a

son.

(smiling at the thought)

Yer daddy and I were so proud. I remember

we went home and neither of us could

sleep all night. Just laid there and

talked bout you, bout what was comin.

SAM

I just built a church. I ain't no

preacher.

DAISY

Yes you are. You were born to it. Just

took you a little ways to get here.

SAM

(to the band)

Thank you, Tommy. You boys is soundin

pretty good up here.

SAM (CONT'D)

I wanna thank ya'll for comin out for the

first day of worship here at Shekinah

Fellowship Church.

45

SAM (CONT'D)

The guest preacher we had booked today

ain't shown up... so I thought I'd say a

word or two.

SAM (CONT'D)

Lotta yous been wonderin what made me

wanna build this here church. Seein as I

ain't the best seed in the bunch I can

understand that.

SAM (CONT'D)

Buncha years ago I was runnin from some

bad fellas in the woods over there by

Cleary. Those old boys was comin after me

hard and I reached in my bag lookin for

my old shotgun but it was gone. My momma

had took it out when I wasn't lookin and

put this bible in there instead...

SAM (CONT'D)

Well I figured I was done for, so I sat

down under an old tree with this useless

book and I waited...

SAM (CONT'D)

... and then the strangest thing

happened. Them boys ran right on past me.

Didn't even see me sittin there. Now the

way I figure it, things would have turned

out pretty different if I had pulled out

that shotgun instead of this here Bible.

And that's probably the first time I can

remember God savin my butt.

(BEAT)

God... and my momma.

SAM (CONT'D)

Figure least I could do was build em both

this church.

46

SAM

Be back soon as I can.

PAIGE

You're gonna miss my play.

SAM

Have momma videotape it for me, k? Now I

gotta git.

LYNN

Call us when you can.

SAM

I will.

SAM (CONT'D)

You watch out for em while I'm gone, ya

hear?

DONNIE

That's done, buddy.

CUT TO:

DENG

You came all this way to bring us new

boots?

47

SAM

Right here, stop the truck!

DENG

Sam, wait...

DENG (CONT'D)

It is not safe here.

SAM

This is it...

ADMINISTRATOR

This is not a good idea.

SAM

I think it's a heckuva good idea.

ADMINISTRATOR

It would be better further south. Closer

to Kampala.

SAM

If I wanted to be closer to Kampala, I'd

be closer to Kampala. I wanna be right

here...

48

ADMINISTRATOR

(ARABIC)

He should not be this far north.

SAM

What are you sayin?

ADMINISTRATOR

The villages in this area are very

remote, Mr. Childers. There is nothing

there.

SAM

Then it seems to me them people need help

the most.

ADMINISTRATOR

(to Deng, Arabic)

He will be killed.

SAM

Talk to me.

ADMINISTRATOR

This is in the war zone, Mr. Childers.

The LRA will kill you here.

SAM

I don't think you understand me, so lemme

make it real clear to ya. I didn't pick

this land -- God did.

DENG

(INTRODUCING)

Sam... this is Betty. She is from the

village of Kotido. A few miles from here.

49

SAM

Good to meet you Betty.

DENG

She is knowing that you need someone to

run the orphanage.

SAM

I'm lookin for somebody who can keep the

place in order. Make sure things is taken

care of when I'm away.

DENG

She can do this.

SAM

She's gonna have to take care of the

children too, make sure they're fed, fix

em when they're sick. Can she do that?

BETTY

(ARABIC)

Quiet now.

SAM

Tell her she's hired.

BETTY

(ARABIC)

You two share a blanket and tomorrow we

will find another.

ROSE

(ARABIC)

Shhhh, it's time to shut your eyes...

50

SAM

You know what's funny? In English your

name means "darn it."

DENG

What is this `darn it?'

SAM

Deng. It means `shucks.' You know, like

you stub your toe and you go "ahhhhh,

deng!" Get it?

DENG

(DEAD SERIOUS)

This is not funny. In my language, in

Arabic, names are very important. They

tell you everything about a man.

(BECOMING HEATED)

Your name proceeds you wherever you go.

You are Sam. This is how you are known.

In my language this means something.

SAM

I'm sorry, buddy. It was just a joke.

SAM (CONT'D)

What does Sam mean in Arabic?

DENG

Small penis.

SAM

Can I ask you a question?

DENG

Of course.

SAM

You believe in God?

DENG

I was raised to believe there was a God

in heaven.

Sometimes I ain't so sure how tough I am.

Helluva thing helpin out those kids, Sam.

Thank you, but I'm gonna be straight with

smoother over there.

Sam, look, everybody is feelin the pinch

I hear that, but you gotta understand

SAM

Five thousand dollars.

BILL

Jesus Christ, Sam! Five thousand dollars?

SAM

That keeps them doors open for another

five thousand dollars for a buncha

African children half-way around the

You're right. We got problems right here.

But with that kinda money we could feed

them kids, house them kids.

Alright, tell you what, lemme see what I

We can thank God for his blessins.

Yes, we can. How many children do you

SAM

Couple hundred with us here. Feed another

thousand a day from nearby villages.

Anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal.

What you are doing is noble, but too

dangerous. I must advise you to stop

risking your life in our struggle.

Until someone starts fightin for these

children, I'm the one that's gonna do it.

GARANG

You are stubborn, aren't you?

As a mule.

GARANG

You and I come from very different

worlds, but we are not so dissimilar.

GARANG (CONT'D)

I founded the SPLA in order to fight for

the future of Sudan because nobody else

would. We fight for freedom from the

government in Khartoum, for the right to

vote, and for the right to worship any

god one may choose.

GARANG (CONT'D)

But most important to me is our struggle

for the children. Their laughter has been

lost to this country for far too long.

There are Peace Talks scheduled for the

end of August in Naivashu. I'd like you

to come as my guest.

SAM

Talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is

a waste of time. You gotta go out and

make it.

GARANG

You are correct, but we must fight them

at every level. Part of my battle is

waged in those rooms. We must talk of

peace, but keep our rifles ready for war.

GARANG (CONT'D)

Maybe together you and I can make Sudan

free once again.

GARANG (CONT'D)

There is a cost for freedom, Sam. A price

for the future of these people. Some pay

with their lives, others pay in different

Rambo or somethin, right?

SAM

BIKER (CONT'D)

Am I right? You a nigger fucker, boy?

could so you could follow your dream.

DONNIE (CONT'D)

I wish you was there to pray with me,

CUT TO:

SAM

Most of you want me to stand up here and

make some sense outta this. That's why

you come here today. You want me to tell

you that God has his plan for all of us,

and when he wants to call us back home

he's gonna do it.

SAM

It's all done, so save yer breath...

where's the keys to the safe?

LYNN

You sold the business for $27,000?

SAM

I need a new truck for the orphanage.

LYNN

A new truck? You sold our business for a

new truck?

LYNN (CONT'D)

That was our future, Sam. Paige's future.

105

LYNN (CONT'D)

Everything we have has gone to those

children, Sam. There's a point when there

ain't no more to give.

SAM

What's the combination? What's the

fucking combination.

LYNN

Paige's birthday.

LYNN (CONT'D)

You don't know it, do you? You don't even

remember your own daughter's birthday.

SAM

What are the numbers?

LYNN

You fight for everyone but us.

LYNN (CONT'D)

You take that and we lose the house. The

church. All of it.

SAM

You can make it up with the ministry.

LYNN

What ministry?! They see what you've

become, Sam. They see how far gone you

are. You need to get quiet with The Lord.

SAM

Fuck the Lord.

LYNN

Don't say that. Don't turn yer back on

him.

SAM

... He turned his back on me! -- on

Donnie! -- on every one of them kids over

there.

LYNN

The good you're doin is destroyin this

family.

106

SAM

LYNN

CUT TO:

DENG

Welcome back.

AGNETE

STOP THE TRUCK! -- STOP!! --

107

AGNETE (CONT'D)

No, no, no! -- don't go back --

DRIVER

WE ARE GOING TO DIE! -- THEY WILL KILL

US!

AGNETE

You move and they'll shoot! -- calm down!

-- I will talk to them.

AGNETE

108

WILLIAM

(ARABIC)

I want to ask you something...

WILLIAM (CONT'D)

This is my brother. His name is

Christopher. He was stolen by the rebels.

(BEAT)

Do you know if he is alive?

109

WILLIAM (CONT'D)

Were you taken when you were young like

me?

WILLIAM (CONT'D)

Do you remember your parents?

DENG

Do you hear that, Preacher?

SAM

What?

DENG

There is no more laughter. The children

do not play here anymore. They are scared

once again.

(BEAT)

But now they are scared of you.

DENG (CONT'D)

The men do not trust you any longer to

lead them into battle. They say you have

a wish to die.

(BEAT)

I am worried about my friend. I want to

help him.

SAM

I don't need your help.

110

WILLIAM

I remember my parents when I sleep. I see

them in my dreams sometimes.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)

My father was big like you. They shot

him. We were so scared. Then the rebels

gave me a club and told me if I didn't

kill my mother they would shoot my

brother and me.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)

I refused, but my mother told me to swing

hard... that I must make her proud...

(BEAT)

And so I did. I made her proud.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)

If we allow ourselves to become full of

hate then they've won. We must not let

them take our hearts. This is the most

important thing.

111

PAIGE

(quiet, into phone)

Hello?

SAM

Bug? You there?

PAIGE
