"BONNIE & CLYDE"

by

David Newman & Robert Benton

2.

BONNIE

Hey, boy!  What you doin' with my

mama's car?

BONNIE

Wait there!

BONNIE

(putting her on)

Ain't you ashamed?  Tryin' to steal

an old lady's automobile.

3.

CLYDE

(with the same put-on)

I been thinkin' about buyin' me one.

BONNIE

Bull.  You ain't got money for

dinner, let alone buy no car.

CLYDE

(still the battle of

wits going on)

Now I got enough money for cokes,

and since it don't look like you're

gonna invite me inside--

BONNIE

You'd steal the dining room table

if I did.

CLYDE

(he moves from his spot)

Come to town with me, then.  How'd

that be?

BONNIE

(starting to walk

onto the sidewalk)

Goin' to work anyway.

CLYDE

Goin' to work, huh?  What do you do?

BONNIE

None of your business.

CLYDE

(pretending to give

it serious thought)

I bet you're a...movie star!

(thinks)

No...A lady mechanic?...No...A

maid?--

BONNIE

(really offended by that)

What do you think I am?

4.

CLYDE

(right on the nose)

A waitress.

BONNIE

(slightly startled by

his accuracy, anxious

to get back now that

he is temporarily

one-up)

What line of work are you in?  When

you're not stealin' cars?

CLYDE

(mysteriously)

I tell you, I'm lookin' for suitable

employment right at the moment.

BONNIE

What did you do before?

CLYDE

(coolly, knowing its effect)

I was in State Prison.

BONNIE

State Prison?

(she shows her surprise)

CLYDE

Yeah.

BONNIE

(herself again)

Guess some little old lady wasn't

so nice.

CLYDE

(tough)

It was armed robbery.

BONNIE

(sarcastically)

My, my, the things that turn up in

the driveway these days.

5.

CLYDE

What do y'all do for a good time

around here, listen to the grass

grow?

BONNIE

Guess you had a lot more fun up at

State Prison, huh?

CLYDE

(showing off, but seriously)

See this foot?

(pointing at his

right foot)

I chopped two toes off of it.  With

an axe.

BONNIE

(shocked)

What?  Why?

CLYDE

To get off the damn work detail,

that's why.

(stopping)

Want to see?

BONNIE

(a lady of some sensitivity)

No!...

(turning a cute)

I surely don't intend to stand here

and look at your dirty feet in the

middle of Main Street.

BONNIE

Boy, did you really do that?

CLYDE

Yeah.

BONNIE

You must be crazy.

DISSOLVE TO:

6.

BONNIE

What's it like?

CLYDE

Prison?

BONNIE

(very interested)

No, armed robbery.

CLYDE

(he thinks it a silly question)

It's...I don't know...it isn't like

anything.

BONNIE

(thinking she's heard

proof that he's a liar)

Hah!  I knew you never robbed bo

place, you faker.

CLYDE

(challenged)

Oh, yeah?

(studies her, then

makes up his mind to

show her)

BONNIE

(goading him on)

Yeah, well you got one all right, I

guess...but you wouldn't have the

gumption to use it.

7.

CLYDE

(picking up the

challenge, proving himself)

You just keep your eyes open.

BONNIE

Hey, what's your name, anyway?

CLYDE

(he slams the hood)

Clyde Barrow.

8.

BONNIE

(loud, to make

herself heard over

the gunning motor)

Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.  Please to

meet you.

9.

BONNIE

(kissing, biting)

...You ready?...

CLYDE

(muffled, laughing)

...Hey, wait...

BONNIE

(giggling herself)

Aren't you ready?  Well, get ready!

BONNIE

(muffled)

C'mon, honey, c'mon, boy...let's

go...let's...

CLYDE

(muffled)

Hey...hey, wait a minute...quit

that now, cut it out.

(sharply)

I said, cut it out!

CLYDE

(trying to be casual,

even insouciant)

Look, I don't do that.  It's not

that I can't--

(his voice cracks,

the match burns his

fingers, and he bangs

his head onto roof of

car, and he goes

right on)

--it's just that I don't see no

percentage in it.

(MORE)

10.

CLYDE (CONT'D)

I mean there's nothin' wrong with

me, I don't like boys.

BONNIE

(finally, spitting

out smoke)

Boy...boy...boy...

CLYDE

(a little annoyed)

Boy, what?

BONNIE

Your advertising is dandy.  Folks'd

just never guess you don't have a

thing to sell.

(a little afraid)

You better take me home, now.

CLYDE

(getting back into car)

Wait!

BONNIE

Don't touch me!

CLYDE

(almost shouting)

If all you want's stud service,

then get on back to West Dallas and

stay there the rest of your life!

CLYDE

But you're worth more'n that, a lot

more, and you know it, and that's

why you come along with me.  You

could find a lover boy on every

corner in town and it doesn't make

a damn to them whether you're

waiting on tables or picking

cotton, so long as you cooperate.

But it does make a damn to me!

11.

BONNIE

(turning, intrigued)

Why?

CLYDE

Why?  Because you're different!

You're like me and you want

different things.

CLYDE

(continuing)

You and me travelin' together, we

could cut clean acrost this state,

and Kansas, too, and maybe dip into

Oklahoma, and Missouri or whatnot,

and catch ourselves highpockets and

a highheeled ol' time.  We can be

somethin' we could never be alone.

I'll show you...when we walk into

the Adolphus Hotel in San Antone',

you wearin' a silk dress, they'll

be waitin' on you and believe me,

sugar, they're gonna know your last

name.

BONNIE

When'd you figure that all out?

CLYDE

First time I saw you.

BONNIE

How come?

CLYDE

(intensely, with real honesty)

'Cause you may be the best damn

girl in Texas.

BONNIE

Who are you, anyway?

CUT TO:

12.

CLYDE

(not answering her,

preferring to lead

the conversation)

I'll tell you about you.

CLYDE

Lessee...You were born somewheres

around East Texas...got a big old

family, right?...You went to

school, of course, but you didn't

take to it much 'cause you was a

lot smarter than everybody else

anyway.  So you just quit.  Now...

(thinking, playing it

for all it's worth)

...When you were sixteen...no,

seventeen, there was a guy who

worked in...uh...

BONNIE

(fascinated)

Cement plant--

CLYDE

Right.  Cement plant.  And you

liked him 'cause he thought you was

just as nice as you could be.  You

almost married that guy, but

then...you thought, no, you didn't

think you would.  So you got your

job in the cafe...

(getting closer to

home now, hitting

them right in there)

And every morning you wake up and

you hate it.  You just hate it.

And you get down there and you put

on your white uniform--

13.

BONNIE

(enthralled)

Pink.

CLYDE

And the truck drivers come in to

eat greasy burgers and they kid you

and you kid them back, but they're

stupid and dumb, boys with big

tattoos all over 'em, and you don't

like it...And they ask you for

dates and sometimes you go...but

you mostly don't, and all they ever

try is to get into your pants

whether you want to or not...and

you go home and sit in your room

and think, when and how will I ever

get away from this?...And now you

know.

CLYDE

(pointing at her hair)

Change that.  I don't like it.

CLYDE

God, you're a knockout.

BONNIE

Hey, that ain't ours.

14.

CLYDE

Sure it is.

BONNIE

But we came in this one.

CLYDE

Don't mean we have to go home in it.

BONNIE

Clyde...

BONNIE

(continuing)

Clyde...

CLYDE

Hey, lady.

BONNIE

(chagrined at her fear)

Where you been keeping yourself?

CLYDE

Slept out by the car.

BONNIE

Oh...These accommodations ain't

particularly deluxe.

CLYDE

No...If they're after us, I want

the first shot.  Come on, you got

some work to do.

15.

BONNIE

You're good.

CLYDE

The best.

BONNIE

And modest...

CLYDE

Come on.  Got you all set up over

here.

CLYDE

Set her spinnin'.

CLYDE

Again.  Come down slow with it...

CLYDE

Ain't you something?  I tell you

I'm going to get you a Smith and

Wesson, it'll be easier in your

hand.  Now try it again once...

FARMER

Heighdo.

16.

FARMER

(frightened)

No sir...no sir.  You all go right

ahead.

FARMER

(continuing)

Used to be my place.  Not any more.

Bank took it.

FARMER

Yessir, moved us off.  Now it

belongs to them.

(He points at the

foreclosure sign.)

BONNIE

Well, that's a pitiful shame.

FARMER

(bitterly)

You're damned right, ma'm.

FARMER

(nodding toward Negro)

Me and him put in the years here.

Yessir.  So you all go right ahead.

We just come by for a last look.

17.

FARMER

You all mind?

FARMER

Hey, Davis!  Come on over here.

FARMER

(continuing)

Much obliged.

FARMER

Otis Harrison.  And this here's

Davis.  We worked this place.

CLYDE

(formally)

Miss Bonnie Parker.  And I'm Clyde

Barrow.

CLYDE

(continuing)

We rob banks.

FADE OUT.

18.

CLYDE

You just stay in the car and watch

and be ready.

(he is playing it

cool, knowing she is

scared.  He thinks

he's James Cagney)

Okay now?

(he hands her a gun

from the glove compartment)

You just be ready if I need you.

CLYDE

Scared?

BONNIE

No.

CLYDE

What are you thinkin' about?

BONNIE

Nothin'.

BONNIE

What are you waitin' for?

19.

CLYDE

(with a swagger)

This is a stickup.  Just take it

easy and nothin' will happen to you.

Gimme the money.

TELLER

(looking up with no

fear, his voice calm

and conversational)

Heighdy.

CLYDE

(nonplussed at this)

Gimme the money!

TELLER

What money?  There ain't no money

here, mister.

CLYDE

(totally befuddled at

the turn of events)

What do you mean there ain't no

money?  This here is a bank, ain't

it?

TELLER

This was a bank.  We failed three

weeks ago.

CLYDE

(furious)

What?  What??

CLYDE

(shoving the teller forward)

Tell her!  Tell her!

20.

TELLER

(acting like a man

who has had his sleep

interrupted by lunatics)

As I was tellin' this gentleman,

our bank failed last month and

ain't no money in it.  I sure am

sorry.

CUT TO:

CLYDE

(steaming)

We got $1.98 and you're laughin'.

CLYDE

Keep it running.

21.

CLYDE

Give me a loaf of bread, a dozen

eggs and a quart of milk.

CLYDE

This is a stickup.  I'll take all

the money in that drawer now.

CLYDE

Get the hell out of here!

22.

CLYDE

Damn him, that big son of a bitch...

He tried to kill me... I ain't got

eyes in back of my head... I didn't

want to hurt him.  It wasn't a real

robbery... Some food and a little

bit of dough.  I'm not against him.

Damn!

CLYDE

What was wrong, anyway?

C.W.

(moving back to screw

on gas cap)

Air bubble--clogged the fuel line.

C.W.

(continuing)

I just blowed her away.

CLYDE

You just blowed it away.

23.

C.W.

'Scuse me, ma'm... Anythin' else I

can do for you?

BONNIE

Well...I'm not sure...

(she looks around)

Say, them little red things there

stickin' up?  Are they gas pumps?

C.W.

(he's not too bright)

Sure.

BONNIE

Isn't that interesting?  How does

that there gasoline get in my

little old car?

C.W.

(trying to be helpful)

Well, y'see, there's this tank

underground, and the gas comes up

this tube into the pump and into

your car, M'am.

BONNIE

My, you're a smart fellow.  You

sure know a lot about automobiles,

don't you?

C.W.

(he has no idea he's

being toyed with)

Yeah, I do.

BONNIE

Well, would you know what kind of a

car this is?

C.W.

(touching it)

Yeah, it's a Chevrolet 8-cylinder

coupe.

BONNIE

No, no.

C.W.

Sure it is.

24.

BONNIE

No, this is a stolen Chevrolet 8-

cylinder coupe.

CLYDE

(getting in the conversation)

You ain't scared, are you?

(to Bonnie)

I believe he is.  What a pity.  We

sure coulda used a smart boy who

knows such a great deal about

automobiles.

(suddenly business-

like, to C.W.)

You a good driver, boy?

C.W.

(getting quite confused)

I guess so.

CLYDE

(pretending to cool

on him)

No, I don't think so.  He's better

off here...

BONNIE

What's your name, boy?

C.W.

C.W. Moss.

BONNIE

What's the C.W. for?

C.W.

(reluctantly)

Clarence Wallace.

BONNIE

I'm Miss Bonnie Parker and this is

Mr. Clyde Barrow.   We... rob...

banks.

(C.W. reacts with

wide eyes)

CLYDE

(swiftly, testing his mettle)

Ain't nothing wrong with that, is

there, boy?

25.

C.W.

(nervously)

Uh, nope--

BONNIE

(with a put-on sigh)

No, he ain't the one.

CLYDE

Unless, Boy, you think you got

enough guts for our line of work?

C.W.

(affronted in his

dumb way)

What do you mean?  I served a year

in the reform school.

BONNIE

Oh, a man with a record!

CLYDE

(laughs)

Now look here, I know you got the

nerve to short-change old ladies

who come in for gas, but what I'm

askin' you is have you got what it

takes to pull bank jobs with us?

BONNIE

Mr. C.W. Moss?

C.W.

(anxious to prove himself)

Sure, I could.  Sure I could.  I

ain't scared, if that's what you

think.

CLYDE

Prove it.

26.

DISSOLVE TO:

BONNIE

(incredulously)

C.W., what are you doing?  Why do

you do that?

27.

C.W.

(beginning to eat it)

Why not?

BONNIE

It's just disgusting, that's why.

C.W.

(chewing)

Not to me it ain't.

BONNIE

But...but it makes everything sweet!

C.W.

Yeah, I know.

C.W.

Damn!  No mayonnaise!

BONNIE

Clyde, why does he have to stay in

the same room as us?

CLYDE

Lemme show you about tomorrow.

BONNIE

Why?

CLYDE

Now C.W.'ll be waitin' right

outside in the car.  Here is the

teller's cage.  Four of them and

over here the desks and what have

you...

BONNIE

Why, Clyde...

CLYDE

Hmmm??

28.

BONNIE

In the same room with us?

CLYDE

Hell, where else?  Ain't gonna

spread out all over the state...

CLYDE

(continuing)

Not yet, anyway.  Now, the door to

the bank is here now.  You cover me

from there.

BONNIE

(takes his hand to

her face)

Just that I love you so much.

CLYDE

You're the best damn girl in Texas.

C.W.

Hey, you spilled the sugar.

CLYDE

(eating)

The layout for tomorrow up in

Mineola.

C.W.

Mineola?  Gosh, that's four, five

hundred miles from here!

CLYDE

So what?  We take U.S. 85 to Willis

Point, don't you know, and cut over

on State Highway 28 at Kaufman,

keep on goin' till we hit the farm-

to-market road that connects to 105

and that's right up by Mineola.  On

a Saturday afternoon...

29.

CLYDE

Keep it running.

CLYDE

(in a very quiet voice)

This is a stickup.

TELLER

What?

CLYDE

This is a stickup.

CUT TO:

30.

CLYDE

Let's go!  Let's go!

CLYDE

Come on!  Get it out!

MAN

Stop!

31.

CLYDE

Boy, you gotta be poor in the head.

You...!  Count of you I killed a

man.  Murder...you too.

CLYDE

(continuing)

Dumb ass stupid.

CLYDE

Ever do a dumb thing like that

again, I'll kill you boy!

BONNIE

Ssshh!  If you boys want to talk

why don't you go outside?

32.

BONNIE

What do you think of me, C.W.?

C.W.

Uh...well, you're just fine, I

guess.  Uh, well, course you're a

real good shot...and...uh...well,

sometimes you look pretty as a

painting.

C.W.

Hey, uh, Bonnie...could you get me

that washrag there?

BONNIE

(coyly)

Why'nt you come get it?

C.W.

(not even realizing

what's on her mind)

Huh?

BONNIE

(wiggling the

washcloth like a

bull-fighter's cape)

Whyn't you come get it, C.W.?

33.

C.W.

Aw, Bonnie, come on, gimme it.

BONNIE

(pertly)

All right, I'll bring it myself.

BONNIE

(irritated with

herself for even

thinking of such a thing)

You simpleton, what would you do if

we just pulled out some night while

you was asleep?

C.W.

(trying to give the

right answer, but

obviously faking it)

Oh, I wouldn't know what to do.

But you wouldn't do that.  You

couldn't now.

BONNIE

That's right, C.W.  We'll always be

around to take care of you.

34.

CLYDE

(quietly)

Bonnie, I want to talk to you.  Sit

down.

CLYDE

(continuing)

This afternoon we killed a man and

we were seen.  Now nobody knows who

you are yet, but they're going to

be after me and anybody who's

runnin' with me.  Now that's murder

now and it's gonna get rough.

(BONNIE nods.  CLYDE

continues speaking

carefully and gently.)

Look, I can't get out, but right

now you still can.  You say the

word and I'll put you on the bus to

go back to your Mother.  'Cause you

mean a lot to me, honey, and I

ain't going to make you run with me.

So if you want, you say the word.

CLYDE

(as he pauses)

Why?  We ain't gonna have a minute's

peace.

BONNIE

Oh, pshaw.

CLYDE

(trying to make her

see the seriousness

of it)

Bonnie, we could get killed.

35.

BONNIE

(death has no reality

for her)

Who'd wanna kill a sweet young

thing like me?

CLYDE

(amused in spite of himself)

I ain't no sweet young thing.

BONNIE

Oh, Clyde, I can't picture you with

a halo, and if you went to the

other place you'd rob the Devil

blind, so he'd kick you right back

to me.

36.

BUCK

(singing)

"What a beautiful thought I am

thinking

Concernin' that great speckled

bird,

Remember his name is recorded

on the pages of God's Holy word..."

BLANCHE

All right, now you did foolish

things as a young man, honey-love,

but you went and paid your debt to

society and that was right.  But

now you just gettin' back in with

the criminal element.

BUCK

Criminal element!  This is my

brother, darlin'.  Shoot, he ain't

no more criminal than you are,

Blanche.

BLANCHE

Well, that ain't what I heard.

BUCK

Now word of mouth just don't go,

darlin', you gotta have the facts.

Shoot.  Why he and me growed up

together, slept and worked side by

side.

(laughing)

God, what a boy he was!

BLANCHE

He's a crook.

BUCK

(chidingly)

Now you stop bad-mouthin' him,

Blanche.  We're just gonna have us

a little family visit for a few

weeks and then we'll go back to

Dallas and I'll get me a job

somewheres.

(MORE)

37.

BUCK (CONT'D)

I just ain't gonna work in your

Daddy's church--That's final.

(laughing it off, singing)

"What a beautiful thought I am

thinking

Concernin' that great speckled

bird..."

CUT TO:

CLYDE

(hugging him)

Buck!

BUCK

Clyde!  You son of a bitch!

CLYDE

How's ma?  How's sister?

BUCK

Just fine, just fine.  Send their

best to you.

CLYDE

(patting Buck's stomach)

Hey, you're fillin' out there.

Must be that prison food.

BUCK

Hell no!

(laughing)

It's married life.  You know what

they say, it's the face powder that

gets a man interested, but it's the

baking powder that keeps him at

home.

(MORE)

38.

BUCK (CONT'D)

(he explodes with

laughter and so does

Clyde, who loves

Buck's jokes)

Hey! you gotta meet my wife.  Hey,

honey, c'mon out here now and meet

my baby brother.

BLANCHE

(suspiciously, quite

the grand lady)

Howdy-do.

CLYDE

(shaking her hand)

Howdy-do.  It's real nice to know

you.

BUCK

(grabbing her)

Well!  You must be Bonnie!  Now I

hear you been takin' good care of

the baby in the family.  Well sis,

I'm real glad to meet you!

(he hugs her; BONNIE

just lets herself be hugged)

Say...

(breaking the hug)

I'd like you to meet my wife,

Blanche.

BONNIE

(stiffly)

Hello.

39.

BLANCHE

(stiffly)

Hello.

CLYDE

Everybody, this is C.W. Moss.

C.W., my brother Buck and his wife,

Blanche.

C.W.

(friendly)

Heighdy, y'all.

C.W.

Well how do, Mrs. Barrow.  Or can I

call you Blanch?  I sure am pleased

to meet you.

(shaking her hand;

Blanche is slowly

going crazy with mortification)

Did you have a hard time findin' us

here in this neck of the woods?

Well, you sure picked a good day

for it.  Say, you got a Screenland

there!  Any new photos of Myrna Loy?

She's my favorite picture star.

BUCK

Hey, lemme get the Kodak!

CLYDE

(lighting up a cigar)

Hey, C.W., go put your pants on.

We're gonna take some pictures.

40.

BUCK

Y'all hear about the guy who

thought Western Union was a cowboy's

underwear?

BONNIE

Lemme get one of my bride and my

brother.

BLANCHE

(getting kittenish,

and overdoing it)

Buck!  Don't take my picture now.

I'm just a mess from driving all day.

BUCK

Oh honey, now you look real fine.

BLANCHE

(with unbecoming

girlish outrage)

Did you take my picture?  Oh Buck!

I declare--

CLYDE

(pulling out his gun

and posing like a

movie tough)

Hey, Buck, get one of this.

BUCK

(giving Clyde the camera)

Clyde, you do one of me and my

missus.

41.

CLYDE

(throwing her a challenge)

Let me take on of Bonnie.

BONNIE

(she yanks the cigar

from Clyde's mouth,

smokes it and poses)

Okay.

BUCK

(drawing Clyde aside)

Hey, brother, let's you and me do a

little talkin'.

CLYDE

(handing C.W. the camera)

Here, C.W., take the girls' picture.

BUCK

(as soon as the door

is shut; conspiratorially)

It was you or him, wasn't it?

CLYDE

Huh?

BUCK

That guy you killed.  You had to,

didn't ya?

CLYDE

(they are protecting

each other)

Yeah, he put me in a spot, so I had

to.  He didn't have a Chinaman's

chance.

BUCK

But you had to--

CLYDE

Yeah.  I had to.

42.

BUCK

(like two kids

keeping a secret from Mom)

Don't say nothin' to Blanche about

it.

CLYDE

Hey, that time you broke out of

jail, she talk you into goin' back?

BUCK

(it is obvious he had

hoped Clyde hadn't

known about it)

Yeah, you hear about that?

CLYDE

I won't say nothin' to Bonnie about

it.

BUCK

I appreciate it.

CLYDE

Yeah...say, what d'ya think of

Bonnie?

BUCK

She's a real peach.

BUCK

Boy, are we gonna have us a good

time!

CLYDE

(matching his merriment)

We surely are!

BUCK

Yessir!

(a pause, then:)

What are we gonna do?

CLYDE

Well, how's this--I thought we'd

all go to Missouri.  They ain't

lookin' for me there.  We'll hole

up someplace and have us a regular

vacation.  All right?

43.

BUCK

No trouble, now?

CLYDE

No trouble.  I ain't lookin' to go

back to prison.

BUCK

Hey, what's this I hear about you

cuttin' up your toes, boy?

CLYDE

(ironically)

That ain't but half of it.  I did

it so I could get off work detail--

breakin' those damned rocks with a

hammer day and night.  Sure enough,

next week I got paroled.  I walked

out of that god-forsaken jail on

crutches.

BUCK

Shoot--

CLYDE

Ain't life grand?

BUCK

And the doc, he takes him aside,

says, "Son, your old mama just

gettin' weak and sickly layin'

there.  I want you to persuade her

to take a little Brandy, y'know, to

pick her spirits up." "Why, doc,"

he says, "you know my mamma is a

teetotaler.  She wouldn't touch a

drop." "Well, I tell you what," the

doc says, "why don't you bring her

a fresh quart of milk every day

from your farm, 'cept you fix it up

so half of it's Brandy and don't

let on!" So he does that, doctors

it up with Brandy, and his mamma

drinks some of it.

(MORE)

44.

BUCK (CONT'D)

And the next day he brings it again

and she drinks some more--and she

keeps it up every day.  Finally,

one week later, he brings her the

milk and don't you know she just

shallows it all down, and looks at

her bag and says, "Son, whatever

you do, don't sell that cow!"

CUT TO:

BUCK

I give him a month's rent in

advance.  We're all set.  Let's get

inside.

CLYDE

Pull up and unload the stuff.

BUCK

(on the running board

of moving car)

Honey-love, I'm taking you into our

first home.

45.

BLANCHE

Oh look, it's so clean, Buck.  And

a Frigidaire...not an icebox!

BUCK

He give me the grocery number.

BUCK

(continuing)

Lemme see, eh 4337...Operator...

please ma'm, may I have 4337...if

you please?

BLANCHE

Oh...they got linoleum on the

counter.  Ain't that clever!

BUCK

Hello, Smitty's grocery...I'd like

to order a mess of groceries.  Oh

yeah...eh 143 Hillsdale Street.

Lessee, about 8 pounds of porkchops,

4 pounds of red beans...a can of

Chase and Sandborn...uh.

BLANCHE

Oh, isn't this something, Daddy!

BUCK

Sshh.  Uh...quart of milk...uh 8

bottles of Dr. Pepper and that's

it, I guess.  No...no.  Uh...a box

of Rice Krispies...Bye now.

CUT TO:

BLANCHE (O.S.)

My, you need a haircut, Daddy.  You

look like a hillbilly boy.

46.

BUCK (O.S.)

Gotcha!

C.W.

Again.

BUCK

Boy, you ain't never gonna beat me

but you keep tryin' now.

BLANCHE

Jest like an ol' man.  Plays

checkers all the time and doesn't

pay any attention to his poor

lonely wife.

BUCK

Cut it out now, honey.  I'm gonna

teach this boy a lesson he'll never

forget.

47.

BONNIE

(doing an unmerciful imitation)

Oh, Daddy, you shore need a haircut.

You look just like a little old

hillbilly boy, I do declare.

(she has her other

hand toying with the

buttons on his shirt,

her hand slipping

under, fluttering

across his bare chest)

Oh mercy me, oh my stars!

BONNIE

(a little louder)

Oh, Daddy!  Yore such a slowpoke!

CLYDE

(amused, but cautionary)

Hush up a little.  They're in the

next room.

BONNIE

(a mock-pout, but

with an edge to it)

Shoot, there's always somebody in

this room, the next room and ever'

other kind of room.

CLYDE

Oof!...now that ain't no nice way

to talk about my brother.

BONNIE

(imitating Blanche

again with baby talk)

I ain't talking about your brother.

48.

BONNIE

Honey, do you ever just want to be

alone with Me?

(sensing Clyde's

sensitivity to the

sexual implication)

I don't just mean like that...I

mean do you ever have the notion of

us bein' out together and alone,

like at some fancy ball, or, I

don't know, where we walk in all

dressed and they announce us and

it's fancy and in public, but we're

alone somehow.  We're separate from

everybody else, and they know it.

CLYDE

I always feel like we're separate

from everybody else.

BONNIE

(it's terribly

important to her)

Do you, baby?

BONNIE

(to all)

Quiet!  I'll get it.

BONNIE

Who is it?

VOICE

Groceries, M'am.

49.

BONNIE

How much?

YOUNG MAN

Six dollars and forty-three cents.

YOUNG MAN

Here, M'am, them bags is heavy.

Let me carry 'em up for you.

BONNIE

(curtly)

No thanks, I'll take 'em.

BUCK'S VOICE

What was it?

CLYDE'S VOICE

Quiet.  Open the door.

BONNIE

C'mon, c'mon...

DISSOLVE TO:

BONNIE

(reading from a pad;

in a recital voice)

It's called "The Ballad of Suicide

Sal."

(she pauses for

effect; then begins:)

"We each of us have a good alibi

For being down here in the 'joint';

But few of them really are justified

If you get right down to the point.

You've heard of a woman's glory

Being spent on a downright cur'."

50.

BUCK'S VOICE (O.S.)

You write that all by yourself?

BONNIE

You want to hear this or not?

BONNIE

"Still you can't always judge the

story

As true, being told by her.

Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty,

Though her features were coarse and

tough--"

BUCK

Yeah, I knew her.  She was cockeyed

and had a hare-lip and no teeth!

BONNIE

"Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare

beauty,

Though her features were coarse and

tough;

She never once faltered from duty

To play on the 'up and up'."

BONNIE

(o.s. as we see out

the window)

"Sal told me this tale on the

evening

Before she was turned out free,

And I'll do my best to relate it

Just as she told it to me--"

CLYDE

(seeing it)

It's the law.

51.

CUT TO:

BONNIE

Dammit, you almost got us killed!

52.

BLANCHE

(crying)

What did I do wrong?  I s'pose

you'd be happier if I got shot.

BONNIE

(at her bitchiest)

Yeah, it would of saved us all a

lot of trouble.

BLANCHE

Buck, don't let that woman talk to

me like that!

BUCK

(caught in the middle

of a bad situation,

knowing Blanche is

wrong, but trying to

soothe her)

You shouldn't have done it, Blanche.

(quietly, cont.)

It was a dumb thing to do.

BLANCHE

(switching tactics)

Please, Buck, I didn't marry you to

see you shot up!  Please, let's go!

Let's get out of here and leave.

Make him stop the car and let us out!

BUCK

(still quietly)

Can't.  I killed a man.  We're in

this now.

BLANCHE

(loud and shrill)

Please!  Please!

BONNIE

(exploding)

Shut up!  Just shut up your big

mouth!  At least do that, will ya,

just shut up.

CLYDE

Cut it out, Bonnie.

BONNIE

(curtly)

Stop the car.  I want to talk to you.

53.

CLYDE

(coldly)

What is it?

BONNIE

Get rid of her.

CLYDE

Can't do that.  She's Buck's wife.

BONNIE

(snapping her words)

Get rid of both of them then.

CLYDE

Why?  What's the matter with you

anyway?

BONNIE

She's what's the matter with me, a

damn stupid back country hick

without a brain in her head.

(contemptuously)

She ain't nothin' but prunes and

proverbs.

CLYDE

(really pissed-off at Bonnie)

What makes you any better?  What

makes you so damn special?  You're

just a West Dallas waitress who

spent half your time pickin' up

truck drivers!

BONNIE

(raising her voice)

You talk to me like that!  Big

Clyde Barrow, just the same as your

brother, an ignorant uneducated

hillbilly.

(with deadly archness)

Only special thing about you is

your peculiar ideas about

lovemakin'--which is no love makin'

at all.

54.

CLYDE

Look, Bonnie--

BONNIE

Clyde...honey...I didn't mean all

that, honey.  Blame it on all that

shootin', I just felt so bad...sure

enough...Clyde?

CLYDE

Okay...Okay, hon...let's get

movin'...

55.

BUCK

(jubilantly)

Hey, y'all, listen to this here:

Law enforcement officers throughout

the Southwest are frankly amazed at

the way in which will-of-the-wisp

bandit Clyde Barrow and his yellow-

haired companion, Bonnie Parker,

continue to elude their would-be

captors.  Since engaging the police

in a gun battle on the streets of

Joplin Missouri and slaying three

of their number...

BLANCHE

Oh, Lord...

BUCK

...the Barrow gang has been reported

as far West as White City, New

Mexico, and as far north as Chicago.

They have been credited with

robbing the Mesquite Bank in the

aforementioned White City, the J.J.

Landry Oil Refinery in Arp, Texas,

the Sanger City National Bank in

Denton, Texas on three different

occasions.  In addition to these

robberies, the fast travelling

Barrows have been rumored to have

had a hand in the robbing of two

Piggly Wiggly stores in Texas, and

one A&P store in Missouri, though

Chief Percy Hammond, who first

identified Clyde Barrow's brother,

Buck, as a member of the gang,

expressed some doubt that these

last robberies were committed by

the Barrow Gang alone.

BONNIE

Go on.

C.W.

(finally)

Clyde, we ain't goin' to see a

restroom for another thirty miles.

Why don't you just stop here?

56.

BUCK

(with a laugh)

Hey now, here's something!  Listen

here: Lone Cop Arrests Two Officers

In Hunt For Barrow.  Police Officer

Howard Anderson's heart turned

faster than his motorcycle when he

forced to the side of the road a

roaring black V-8 sedan in which

were three men and a blondheaded

woman yesterday afternoon.

BUCK

When he saw several machine guns in

the car he was certain he'd caught

Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, and

maybe Buck Barrow and the third

unidentified member of the gang.

It took a lot of telephoning and

explaining to convince the

motorcycle cop that his captives

were two highway patrolmen and a

blonde-haired stenographer from the

Highway Patrol--.  Haw!  Haw!

(everybody busts up

with laughter)

57.

BUCK

Anderson was held up as an example

for every other Texas peace officer

today. "That was a mighty brave

thing," explained Highway Patrol

Chief L.C. Winston.

CLYDE

Sheriff!

C.W.

Boy!  What a shot, Clyde!

BUCK

Sweet Jesus, I never seen shootin'

like that!

CLYDE

(examining the man's

wallet, really surprised)

Well, now, getta load of this.  I

want y'all to know we are in the

custody of Cap'n Frank Bryce, and

Frank here is a Texas Ranger.

58.

C.W.

Sure 'nough, Clyde?

BUCK

Say there, peacemaker.  I believe

you got your spurs all tangled up.

You're in Missouri, you know that?

CLYDE

You didn't know you was in Missouri?

C.W.

He's lost, this here Texas Ranger.

CLYDE

(a little pissed)

--he ain't lost...them banks are

offerin' extra reward money fer us,

and Frank figured on easy pickin's,

didn't you?

(he suddenly knocks

Bryce's hat off)

Didn't you?

CLYDE

--Now you ain't hardly doin' your

job, Texas Ranger.  You oughta be

home lookin' after the rights of

poor folks, not out chasin' after us.

BUCK

(trying to be casual)

Easy there, Clyde.  Why take is so

personal.

CLYDE

(to Bryce)

Reg'lar laws is one thing.  But

this here bounty hunting, we got to

discourage that.

59.

BUCK

Like how, Clyde?--

C.W.

(trying to be helpful)

Shoot him.

C.W.

(trying again)

...hang him?...

BONNIE

(suddenly)

--uh-uh.  Take his picture.

C.W.

Take his picture?

BONNIE

(pointedly ignoring

C.W., brightly)

Then we'll let the newspapers have

it--so's everyone can see Captain

Frank Bryce of the Texas Rangers

with the Barrow gang--

(moving demurely to Bryce)

--and all bein' just as friendly as

pie.

BUCK

(grasping

possibilities immediately)

...yeah, yeah...

BONNIE

(continuing right on,

coyly picking up

Bryce's gun from grill)

--why we 'bout the friendliest

folks in the world.  Texas Ranger

waves his big ol' gun at us, and we

just welcome him like he's one of

our own.

60.

CLYDE

(grinning widely)

Buck, get the Kodak!

BUCK

(relieved and excited)

Hot dog!

CLYDE

(to Bryce)

We're mighty proud to have a Texas

Ranger in the family.

BUCK

...keep him set on the hood,

there...more to the sun, like

that...yeah...when all his ranger

friends see this...I bet he's gonna

wish he was dead!

CLYDE

(to Bryce)

...see what come o' your

mischief?...not doin' your job?

Down in Duncanville last year poor

farmers kepts the laws away from us

with shot guns...you're s'posed to

be protectin' them from us, and

they're protectin' us from you.

(giggling)

--don't make sense, do it?

BUCK

C'mon, now, Clyde, you and Bonnie

first.  Move into him, right close,

right friendly.

CLYDE

All righty

(to Bryce, whose

hands are tied,

hemmed in by them both)

Don't move, now, hear?

61.

BONNIE

How's this? "Captain Bryce and new

found friend."

CLYDE

...yeah, yeah...quick, Buck, get

it...

BUCK

...I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it.

BUCK

(frantic)

I got the picture.  I got the

picture...

CLYDE

(oblivious)

Lemme be, lemme be...

BUCK

(holding tightly to

Clyde, yelling)

I got the PICTURE!

62.

CLYDE

...All right, all right...

(to Bryce, yelling)

WE GOT YOU...HEAR?... REMEMBER...

YOU... YOUR FACE...WE GOT IT...WE

GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU...

DISSOLVE:

CLYDE

This is the Barrow gang.

(the people turn and freeze)

Everybody just take it easy and

nobody will get hurt.

BUCK

Don't do nothin' silly now.

CLYDE

That your money or the bank's?

FARMER

Mine.

CLYDE

Keep it, then.

63.

CLYDE

(to the guard, who

has practically

frozen in fear)

Next time I'll aim a little lower.

BUCK

Get a good look at us!  We're the

Barrow boys.

BUCK

Happy birthday.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

BUCK

(to C.W. at the wheel)

Kick it in the pants, C.W.

64.

CLYDE

We got to make that state line!

C.W.

(driving like a wild

man, but adlibing loudly)

Can't get more'n this out of a

Plymouth!

CUT TO:

BANK GUARD

(enjoying the limelight)

Then he saw me goin' for my gun.

Clyde Barrow himself, I mean.  And

suddenly I was starin' into the

face of death!

WOMAN TELLER

Tsk, tsk.

PHOTOGRAPHER

Just look this way, Mr. Hawkins.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

65.

FIRST POLICEMAN

Step on it, Randolph.  We gotta

catch 'em 'fore they reach the

state line!

CUT TO:

FARMER

Clyde?...he looked like, well he

looked real...clean...and Bonnie,

she's too much a lady ever to be

caught with a cigar in her mouth...I

don't care what you heard before.

I saw 'em right here, not twenty

minutes ago...

(gravely)

--and all's I can say is, they did

right by me, and I'm bringin' me a

mess of flowers to their funeral.

CUT TO:

CLYDE

Okay, relax.  We're in Oklahoma now.

Slow down.

CUT TO:

FIRST POLICEMAN

Turn around.  Don't waste no more

gas.

SECOND POLICEMAN

(a young eager beaver type)

Ain't we gone to catch 'em?

66.

FIRST POLICEMAN

Hell, they're over the State line.

That's out of our jurisdiction.

SECOND POLICEMAN

Why don't we get 'em anyway?

FIRST POLICEMAN

I ain't gone to risk my life in

Oklahoma.  That's their problem.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLYDE

(disappointed)

Hell.  That ain't much, is it?

BUCK

(commiseratingly)

Times is hard,

CLYDE

Well, let's get to it.

CLYDE

This is Clyde Barrow.

(lays down a bill)

Buck Barrow...

(lays down a bill)

Bonnie Parker...C.W.

(goes back to the

first again and lays

out another round)

Clyde, Buck...Bonnie...C.W. Clyde,

Clyde again...Buck...Bonnie...C.W.

67.

CLYDE

Bonnie...C.S....Clyde...

BUCK

(very ill at east in

this position he has

been forced into)

Um...eh...Clyde?

CLYDE

Hah?

BUCK

Uh, Clyde...well...what about

Blanche?

BONNIE

(incredulous)

WHAT?

BLANCHE

Well, why not?  Say I earned my

share!  Same as everybody.  I

coulda got killed same as everybody,

and I'm wanted by the law same as

everybody.  Besides I coulda got

snake bit sleepin' in them woods

every night!

(building it up)

I'm just a nervous wreck and that's

the truth.  And I have to listen to

sass from Miss Bonnie Parker all

the time.  I deserve mine!

CLYDE

(with a sigh)

Okay...okay...hold your horses,

Blanche.  You'll get your share.

68.

BUCK

Married a preacher's daughter and

she still thinks she's takin' the

collection.

BUCK

(to Blanche)

Well, don't spend it all in one

place now, hear?

BONNIE

She'll be doin' right well to spend

it at all.

CLYDE

Bonnie?

CLYDE

(a little defensive)

Look, Bonnie, I've said it and I

guess I'll keep sayin' it before

we're thru--Blanche is Buck's wife

and Buck is family.

BONNIE

(finally, utterly

without malice)

--she's such a silly-Billy...

BONNIE

My family could use some of that

money.

69.

CLYDE

Them laws have been hangin' round

your mamas house 'til all hours,

Bonnie.  It's just too risky to go

there.

BONNIE

(exploding)

Well, where can we go?  We rob the

damn banks, what else do we do?

C.W.

CLYDE!  CLYDE!  CLYDE!

CLYDE

(wincing as they are

nose to nose)

I hear you, C.W.

C.W.

This ol' heap's gushin' oil!  We

got to swipe us another set of

wheels right away, or we won't get

anywhere.  Look here.

C.W.

See?

DISSOLVE:

WOMAN

Oh, now...now, dear...

70.

MAN

Mmmm...sweet thing...

WOMAN

Say, isn't that your car, Eugene?

MAN

(still nuzzling her)

Mmmmmm...huh?

(he looks, leaps from

the swing)

That's my car!  Hey!

EUGENE

I'll tear 'em apart!  Those punks!

Steal a man's car right out from

under him!  Wait till I get my

hands on those kids, Velma, I'll

show 'em!

VELMA

What if they have guns, Eugene?

EUGENE

(realizing the

possibility, he

suddenly stops being

mad and turns chicken)

We'd better get the police and let

them handle this.

VELMA

Right.

71.

EUGENE

Turn around and let's get back to

town.  We'll go get the sheriff.

CUT TO:

BUCK

They stopped chasin' us.  They

turned around.

CLYDE

Let's take 'em.

CUT TO:

VELMA

Oh, my Lord, they're comin' after us.

EUGENE

(in a panic)

Step on it, Velma, step on it!

72.

CLYDE

C'mon, get out!  Get out of there,

I said.

CLYDE

(ordering them into

the other car)

Get in here.

BUCK

What's your name?

EUGENE

(hesitantly)

I'm Eugene Grizzard.

VELMA

I'm Velma Davis.

73.

BUCK

(just as friendly as

he can be)

Well, howdy!  We're the Barrow gang.

That there is Clyde drivin' and I'm

Buck.

BONNIE

Look, don't be scared, folks.  It

ain't like you was the law.  You're

just folks like us.

EUGENE

(agreeing over-enthusiastically)

Yeah, yeah, that's the truth.

CLYDE

I expect you been readin' about us.

EUGENE

Yes.

VELMA

No.

EUGENE

(meaningfully)

Yes, Velma, we have too.

BONNIE

(laughing at the contretemps)

Well, you two must be in love, I bet.

BUCK

(gleefully, clapping

his hands)

Well, when you gonna marry the

girl, boy?

CUT TO:

74.

BONNIE

So then she drinks her milk down

again, every drop.  And she looks

over at her son and says, "Son,

whatever you do, don't sell that

cow!"

CUT TO:

BONNIE

(to Velma)

How old are you, honey?

VELMA

Thirty-three.

VELMA

Now I ordered some French fries,

didn't I?

75.

BUCK

(passing her some)

Yeah, here you go.

CLYDE

Take it easy on those French fries,

Velma.  Ain't that right, Eugene?

EUGENE

(studying his hamburger)

This isn't mine.  I ordered mine

well done.  Who's got the other

hamburger?

C.W.

Oh, is this supposed to be yours?

EUGENE

That's okay, forget it.

BUCK

(chewing)

Haw!  I sure am havin' a good time!

How 'bout you folks?  Ain't you

glad we picked you up?

CLYDE

(laughing)

Hey, maybe y'all ought to join up

with us.

EUGENE

(laughing)

Ha!  Wouldn't they be surprised

back home to hear that?

VELMA

Yeah.  What would Martha and Bill

say if they heard that?

(she roars with laughter)

(MORE)

76.

VELMA (CONT'D)

EUGENE

Lordy!  They'd throw a fit!

(roars with laughter)

BONNIE

(laughing)

What do you do, anyway?

EUGENE

(as his laugh begins

to fade)

I'm an undertaker.

BONNIE

(tautly, in a flat voice)

Get them out of here.

77.

CLYDE

(breathing heavily)

...see anythin', Buck?

BUCK

--not yet, boy.

CLYDE

(with an edge of

paranoia, as if the

three of them might

be withholding

something from him)

--and nobody saw her leave, or

heard anythin'

(almost a threat)

...C.W....?

CLYDE

(lamely)

...Well, where do you think she

could've gone?...Buck?...Buck?

BUCK

(amazed and a little frightened)

Jesus, I don't know...

CLYDE

There!  There!  There!

78.

BONNIE

Leave me alone!  Leave me alone!

CLYDE

(holding her, kissing

her frantically)

Hey...hey, hey, baby, hey, Bonnie,

hey baby...

(calming her down)

...Hey, hey now...just where did

you think you were goin'?...

CLYDE

(still frantic)

--Huh.  Bonnie?  Where?  Where?

79.

BONNIE

I don't know!  You're hurting me, I

was just scared is all...and my

mama's been on my mind, and she's

gettin' so old...

CLYDE

Boy, don't ever leave without

sayin' somethin'.  You really

scared me, Bonnie.

BONNIE

But I mean it, though.  I want to

see my mama.  Please, Clyde.

CLYDE

(enormously relieved,

kissing her)

Okay, sweetheart.

DISSOLVE TO:

SISTER

Here you are, we been cuttin' and

pastin' everything we could find

about you in the papers.

80.

BUCK

Hey look, here's that one I took of

you, Clyde.  That came out just fine!

BUCK

(singing)

Oh, Horsey! keep your tail up, keep

yer tail up, keep yer tail up, Oh,

Horsey! keep yer tail up, Why don't

you make it rise.

BONNIE'S UNCLE

(rising)

Where y'all headed from here?

CLYDE

(right back)

I don't know, what y'all got in

mind?  At this point we ain't

headin' to anywhere, we're just

runnin' from.

81.

BONNIE'S SISTER'S VOICE

C'mon, down, Litte Tom!  We're

goin' home.  Little Tom?  Mathew,

fetch Little Tom.

BONNIE

Don't go yet, Mama.

UNCLE'S VOICE

(cutting in)

C'mere, c'mere you little corn

roller.

MOTHER

...you know, Clyde, I read about

y'all in the papers and I'm jes'

scared.

BONNIE

(to Clyde)

Sugar, make mama stay a while yet.

CLYDE

(ignoring Bonnie, as

does Mother,

ebulliently, even joshing)

Now Mrs. Parker, don't y'all

believe what you read in the papers!

That's the law talking there.  They

want us to look big so's they'll

look big when they catch us.

CLYDE

--and they can't do that.  Why, I'm

even better at runnin' than robbin'

banks--aw shoot, if we done half

the stuff they said we did, we'd be

millionaires, wouldn't we, old

sugar.

(MORE)

82.

CLYDE (CONT'D)

(he turns to Bonnie

who continues to

stare at her Mother)

And I wouldn't risk Bonnie here

just to make money, uncertain as

times are.  Why one time I knowed

of a job where we could of make

$2000 easy, but I saw the law

outside and I said to myself, why

Bonnie could get hurt here.  So I

just drove right on and let that

money lay.

MOTHER

...Maybe you know the way with her,

then.  I'm just an old woman and I

don't know nothin...

CLYDE

We'll be quittin' this just as soon

as the hard times is over, Mother

Parker, I can tell you that.  Why

me and Bonnie were just talkin' the

other day and we talked about when

we'd settle down and get us a home,

and Bonnie said, "I couldn't bear

to live morn'n three miles from my

precious mother." Now how'd you

like that, Mother Parker?

MOTHER

Don't believe I would.  I surely

don't.

(to Bonnie)

You try to live three miles from me

and you won't live long, honey.

(to Clyde)

You'd best keep runnin' and you

know it, Clyde Barrow.

(matter of fact)

Bye, baby.

83.

DISSOLVE:

BUCK

How long have ya had it?

C.W.

(like some docile

animal submitting to inspection)

--just got it.

BUCK

(to Blanche, who

stares fascinated as

one of C.W.'s pectoral

muscles contracts and

the wings flutter)

Touch it, honey!  Go on!

BLANCHE

(titillated with delight)

Oh, no, Daddy!  No!

84.

BONNIE

What are you all doin'?

C.W.

(insensitive to

Bonnie's stare)

Playin' with my tattoo, Bonnie.

BONNIE

Well, why don't you all go play

with it somewhere else?

BLANCHE

What's bothering her?

CLYDE

(sees something coming)

Not now, Blanche.

BUCK

(who doesn't want to

be victimized by

Bonnie's temperament)

What's bothering her, Clyde?

BONNIE

(exploding)

I said go somewhere else!

CLYDE

(straightening up,

matter-of-fact)

Bonnie's hungry, C.W. I saw a

chicken place a few miles back.

Who all wants to go get some food?

BLANCHE

(rising from her

chair, a little

shaken at Bonnie's outburst)

I sure do.  I'm plenty tired of

sittin' around here anyway.

85.

BUCK

(not making a move to

get up)

You can't drive, honeylove.

C.W.

(reluctantly)

I'll go.

C.W.

What's everybody want?

CLYDE

Just five chicken dinners, and get

somethin' for dessert.

BUCK

See if they got peach ice cream.

(he grins and pats

his stomach)

BONNIE

I hate you all.

CLYDE

I hate y'all, too.

BONNIE

no, I really hate you.

86.

BONNIE

(eyes brimming)

Oh, baby, I've got the blues so

bad...

CLYDE

Bonnie?...is it your mama, what

your mama said?

BONNIE

What mama?...she's just an old

woman now...I have no mama...

BONNIE

(quietly)

...so funny...I thought when we

first went out, we were really

goin' somewhere...but this is it--

we're just goin', huh?

CLYDE

Do you care about where we're goin'?

BONNIE

Not as long as you care about me.

CLYDE

(quite simply)

Why I love you, sugar.

BONNIE'S VOICE

--enough to die with me, baby?...

'cause I think that's where we're

goin'...I surely do.

87.

CLYDE

--wherever.

DISSOLVE:

C.W.

(conversationally)

You sure smokin' all the time lately.

BLANCHE

(quick to take

offense, snaps)

So what?

C.W.

Nothin'.

BLANCHE

Oh, God...

C.W.

Whyn't you go back home to your papa?

BLANCHE

(it's been her dream)

Oh, if I could!  If I could just do

that one thing!  Oh, there's no

tellin' why this all happened.  I

was a preacher's daughter.

C.W.

When church is your pa affiliated

with?

88.

BLANCHE

(much more interested

in talking about herself)

Baptist...oh, and he thought the

world of Buck, my daddy did, even

knowing that Buck was serving time

in jail.  He forgave him for that

'cause he paid his debt to society.

C.W.

We were Disciples of Christ.

BLANCHE

Hey, C.W., I ain't got my money.

Give me some, will you?

DEPUTY

(to counterman)

Get Sheriff Smoot on the phone.

DISSOLVE TO:

89.

BONNIE'S VOICE

Ready?

CLYDE'S VOICE

(a little embarrassed)

Aw Bonnie--

BONNIE'S VOICE

(coaxing)

C'mon!

BONNIE

Lie down now, honey.

CLYDE

I've done enough!

BONNIE

(with patience, to a child)

You have to lie down...it's the

only way we can tell what we'll

look kike together.

CLYDE

(staring up at

himself talking with

cigar clenched

between his teeth)

Whatta you think?

90.

BONNIE

(it suddenly strikes her)

That's not the right tie!

CLYDE

What?

BONNIE

(rising, weaving a little)

You can't wear polka-dots on an

occasion like this.

CLYDE

Well what--

BONNIE

Stripes.  Don't go away now.

BONNIE

Perfect.

CLYDE

OK, o.k.  If we're gonna do this,

at least I can tie it myself.  Lie

down before you fall down.

CLYDE

(grudgingly)

Better?

BONNIE

Much.

91.

BONNIE & CLYDE

(to the lugubrious

strains of the Death March)

"Did you ever think when a hearse

went by,

That somebody you or I may die?

They'll wrap you up in a big white

sheet

and bury you down just about six

feet,

The worms crawl in, the worms crawl

out,

The worms play penuckle on your

snout.

Your eyes fall in, your teeth fall

out,

Your face turns green and the pus

runs out.

C.W.

I'm gonna die if I don't get some

sleep.  Quit singing that.

BONNIE

All right, shut your eyes now.

CLYDE

(playing along with her)

No, you first.

BONNIE

One for the money.

CLYDE

Two for the show.

BONNIE

Three to get ready--

CLYDE & BONNIE

Four to Go.

92.

BLANCHE

(calling out)

The men are on the other side.

93.

94.

BLANCHE

Oh, God, please help us!  Dear

Father in Heaven, get us out of

this and Buck will never do another

bad thing in his life!

(she continues

moaning, praying, sobbing)

95.

C.W.

He ain't got a chance.  Half his

head blown off.

BLANCHE

My eyes!

(she SCREAMS)

God, I think I'm blind.

(in the headlights)

...light hurts so bad...

BLANCHE

(clinging)

Please, please get us to a doctor!

Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor.

We'll die here.

BONNIE

(helping with glasses)

--here, hon'.

BLANCHE

(going on)

Clyde, Clyde, please get us to a

doctor.

BLANCHE

He's your brother!

BONNIE

(gently, knowing

CLYDE will not and

cannot answer BLANCHE)

Buck can't be moved, now, hon'.

96.

BUCK

(weakly)

Clyde?...Clyde?...

CLYDE

Right here, boy.

BUCK

I believe I lost my shoes...maybe

the dog hid 'em...

(he lapses into

unconsciousness again)

MAN

Surrender!

97.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

98.

CUT TO:

BLANCHE

Don't kill him!  Don't kill him!

He's dying!

BLANCHE

Don't die, Daddy.  Don't die!

99.

CUT TO:

CLYDE

(panting, to Bonnie)

Saw...saw a farm...up ahead...gotta

get...a car...

BONNIE

Baby, no...

100.

C.W.

Maybe--

BONNIE

Shhh!

BONNIE

(finally)

Oh, no.

C.W.

(nervously)

What?  What?

BONNIE

(as though it were

the most logical

thing in the world)

I can't die without Clyde.  I just

can't.

C.W.

(tugging at both of

them frantically)

C'mon!  C'mon!  C'mon!

ABRUPT CUT:

101.

CLYDE

Head out, C.W.

C.W.

(determinedly)

I'm goin' home to my daddy's farm.

DISSOLVE TO:

C.W.

(about to drop)

Can y'all spare me a little water?

MAN

Who are you, boy?

C.W.

Name's Moss.

MAN

(in really hushed and

reverent tones)

It's Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.

102.

BOY

Who was they, Pa?

MAN

That was Bonnie and Clyde, the bank

robbers.

DISSOLVE TO:

103.

MALCOLM

Who's there?

C.W.

(calling back)

Daddy?

MALCOLM

Who's there?  Who is it?

C.W.

It's C.W.  It's Clarence.

MALCOLM

Clarence!

MALCOLM

God, it's good to see you, boy!

MALCOLM

What's that on your chest?

C.W.

(puzzled)

Huh?

(realizing what he means)

It's a tattoo...I'm in trouble.

I'll tell you about it later.  My

friends are hurt.  Help me get 'em

in.

MALCOLM

Jesus, what happened to them?  You

in trouble, son?

C.W.

Yeah.  That's Clyde Barrow and

Bonnie Parker.

(reaction from Malcolm)

We been shot.  Help me get 'em

inside.  We gotta help 'em.

104.

MALCOLM

Why'd you get yourself marked up?

A tattoo!  What in hell made you do

a damn fool thing like that?

C.W.

C'mon, Pa, open the door.

BILLY

I was in the bunch that took 'er.

See here?  Can you make me out?

Here I am, see here, right behind

Joe Boyd here.

PETE

Sure enough, Billy, is that your

head there?

BILLY

Still can't figure how we let them

other two get away.

PETE

(an older, more

genial type)

Yeah, seems as how nobody can get

'em somehow.

BILLY

(sullen)

Yeah...well, maybe this boy'll be

the one to do it, this Hamer guy.

Boy if he can't do it, Sheriff,

ain't nobody but the whole U.S.

Army can do it.

105.

PETE

(with a new note of

enthusiasm, gets up

and walks to the

window--turning to Billy)

You hear he quit the Rangers on

account of Texas got that woman

governor.  Said he wouldn't work

under no woman.

BILLY

(respectfully)

Yeah, that's somethin' all right.

Say, how many they say he shot

anyway in his day?

PETE

Sixty-five they say.

BILLY

Son of a sea-cook!

HAMER

(with politeness

arising from condescension)

Excuse me, am I in the right place?

Is this Sheriff Smoot?

PETE

(mispronouncing his name)

Frank Hammer.  I sure am pleased to

meet you!

(shakes his hand)

HAMER

Hamer.

106.

CLYDE

(still snapping rope)

FLED?  What do they mean, fled?

How in the nama God could I leave

my brother to die when he was

already dead when I left him?

(livid)

He was shot in too many pieces to

pick off the ground!  Fled...what

do they know, the papers or the

police?...

CLYDE

Why, while we were all lyin' around

here, near dead, they had us

holdin' up the Grand Prairie

National Bank!  They hung that one

on us just for luck, I guess.

CLYDE

Tell you what.  Soon's we get well,

we're gonna take that bank!

CLYDE

(remarking on his own dizziness)

Whooooooo, boy...

(kneeling, to Bonnie)

They don't know nothin'--do they,

sugar?

107.

BONNIE

(assuring him)

You did all you could, hon'.

Nobody coulda done more.

C.W.

Hey.  How come I'm always called

the "Un-identified sus-spect?"

CLYDE

(to C.W.)

You can just thank your lucky stars

that's all you are.  So long's they

don't have your last name, you're

home safe.

MALCOLM

(toadying to Clyde,

talking to Clarence)

Mr. Barrow's lookin' out for your

interests, boy.

C.W.

(impressed)

Oh...Hey, Pa, how you like havin' a

coupla big deals stayin' with you?

MALCOLM

(friendly as can be)

Ain't that somethin' for me?

CLYDE

(back in good mood, expansive)

Well now, you been real nice to us,

and I tell you what, let us pay you

forty dollars for your hospitality,

what do you say?

MALCOLM

(protesting vehemently)

No, no, no.  I don't want your

money.  I'm just pleased to have

your company.  Any friend of my

boy's...

C.W.

(abruptly)

Hey, Pa, let's have supper.  I'm

hungry.

108.

MALCOLM

(smiling)

Yeah...okay, Clarence...

(to Clyde)

You're welcome here, now you know

that.

MALCOLM

(indicating tatto

which flutters

through C.W.'s open shirt)

You look like trash, boy, marked up

like that.  Cheap trash.

C.W.

(protesting)

Bonnie says it looks good.

MALCOLM

Bonnie, what does she know.  She's

just cheap trash herself.  Look

what they do to you, and you don't

even get your name in the paper--

just pictures put on your skin, by

"Bonnie and Clyde"--

(more to himself)

--why they're a coupla kids.

C.W.

But, Daddy--

MALCOLM

I'm just glad your ma ain't alive

to see that thing.

C.W.

I don't see what's so bad about it...

109.

HAMER

(quietly, but

suddenly, his voice

muffled by the handkerchief)

Blanche Barrow.

BLANCHE

What?  What?  Who is it?

HAMER

(in a monotone, a

relentless questioner)

You know your husband's dead.

BLANCHE

(her voice flat and expressionless)

I know.

HAMER

You're going to prison.

BLANCHE

I know it.

HAMER

Where's the rest of 'em?

BLANCHE

I don't know.

HAMER

Where's the rest of 'em?

BLANCHE

I just don't know.  I don't know.

HAMER

How'd you get in with them?

110.

BLANCHE

(starting slow, but

warming up to the

subject, she begins

to talk and talk for

the sake of airing

her troubles)

I didn't mean to.  I didn't.  Buck

said we was just goin' to visit, we

wouldn't be doin' no robbin' and

stealin', and then we went to

Joplin and all of a sudden they

started shootin'.

(hysteria begins to

creep into her voice

as she relives it all)

And we run off, God, I was scared.

And then it was run all the time,

and I wanted to go, I begged to go,

but Clyde and Bonnie and C.W.--

HAMER

(seizing on it)

C.W.  C.W. who?

BLANCHE

C.W. Moss.

FADE OUT:

CLYDE

Want a ginger-snap, Bonnie?

111.

BONNIE

(busy, absorbed)

No, hum-umm.

(then she realizes

his nice gesture and

smiles warmly at him)

But thanks anyway, Clyde.

(she takes it all in,

her situation, and

looks content and cozy)

It's real nice here, just the two

of us like this.

CLYDE

(more interested in

his paper)

Uh-huh.

(something in the

paper catches his interest)

Look here, honey, remember this?

BONNIE

Yeah, at the motel.

CLYDE

(studying the picture)

You sure don't resemble that no more.

CLYDE

What you writin' this time?

BONNIE

(intensely)

I'm writing a poem about us.  I'm

writing our story.

CLYDE

(this appeals to his ego)

Oh, are you?  Let's hear it.  If

it's good, I'll mail it in to the

Law and it'll be printed in all the

papers again.

BONNIE

Just let me finish this line.

112.

BONNIE

(continuing)

Okay, here it is.

BONNIE

(reading)

"The Story of Bonnie and Clyde"

You've heard the story of Jesse

James--

Of how he lived and died:

If you're still in need

Of something to read

Here's the story of Bonnie and

Clyde.

Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow

Gang

I'm sure you all have read

How they rob and steal

And those who squeal

Are usually found dying or dead.

They call them cold-hearted killers;

They say they are heartless and

mean;

But I say this with pride,

That I once knew Clyde

When he was honest and upright and

clean.

But the laws fooled around,

Kept taking him down

And locking him in a cell,

Till he said to me,

"I'll never be free

So I'll meet a few of them in

hell."

The road was so dimly lighted;

There were no highway signs to

guide;

But they made up their minds

If all roads were blind,

They wouldn't give up till they died.

CUT TO:

113.

HAMER

The road gets dimmer and dimmer;

Sometimes you can hardly see;

But it's fight man to man,

And do all you can,

For they know they can never be

free.

From heartbreak some people have

suffered;

From weariness some people have

died;

But take it all in all,

Our troubles are small,

Till we get like Bonnie and Clyde.

BONNIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

If a policeman is killed in Dallas,

And they have no clue or guide;

If they can't find a fiend,

They just wipe their slate clean

And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.

BONNIE

If they try to act like citizens

And rent them a nice little flat

About the third night

They're invited to fight

By a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat.

Some day they'll go down together;

They'll bury them side by side;

To few it'll be grief--

To the law a relief--

But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.

114.

CLYDE

(in gleeful wonder)

Damn!  That's me!

CLYDE

(continuing)

In that poem!

CLYDE

(continuing; it is

all starting to come

out now--his

realization that he

has made it, that he

is the stuff of

legend, that he is an

important figure)

A sub-gun's rat-tat-tat!

(he begins to laugh loudly)

Right in the paper!

CLYDE

Jesse James!  You hear 'bout old

Jesse, now you goin' to hear 'bout

Clyde!

CLYDE

(continuing)

Pshhhhhh!

115.

CLYDE

(continuing)

Damn, Bonnie!  You musta been one

hell of a waitress!

CLYDE

(shaking his head

back and forth like a

puppy, just so much

glee in him that he

can't hold it)

Oooooh, that Clyde!  That's my boy,

that Clyde!

CLYDE

Bonnie...

(she hugs him back)

The Poem of Bonnie and Clyde!

BONNIE

(laughing at the

mistake, happy)

The Story.

CLYDE

The Story of Bonnie and Clyde!  Oh,

child, you really did tell that

story!

116.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLYDE

(chuckling, apparently

quite pleased)

Damn!...damn...damn!

CLYDE

(not looking at her)

Hey, listen, Bonnie, how do you feel?

BONNIE

(watching him

steadily, her slight

smile growing)

Fine.

CLYDE

I mean you feel like you're s'posed

to feel after you've uh...

BONNIE

Just.

117.

CLYDE

(doesn't know what

the fuck to say,

desperately wants her approval)

Well, that's good, ain't it.

Reason I ask is, I uh... Well, I

figger it's a good idea to ask.  I

mean how else do I tell if I did it

the way...

BONNIE

(stopping him, with

great warmth)

Hey.  You done just perfect.

CLYDE

I did, didn't I?  I mean I did, I

really did.  I did it, I did, I

mean this was my first time and it

was just like rollin' off a log

when it comes right down to it, it

was easy, I mean I didn't even have

to try...

DISSOLVE TO:

MALCOLM

(whispering)

Boy, they expect you to go downtown

with 'em tomorrow?

C.W.

(out loud, licking

his ice cream)

Who?

118.

MALCOLM

(raising his own

voice, infuriated by

his son's obtuseness)

Bonnie and Clyde!...

(he slaps the carton

out of C.W.'s hands;

whispering again)

Bonnie and Clyde.

C.W.

Sure, I always go with them.

MALCOLM

...better go then, you better go,

better go...

(forcing C.W. to sit

at table)

--but when they get back in the car

to come on home, don't get in with

them.

C.W.

(genuinely puzzled)

Why, Daddy?

MALCOLM

You just listen to your Pa fer once!

Cain't you do that?  I'm yore

Daddy, I'm your kin, not Clyde.

C.W.

(still confused)

Well, what should I tell 'em? "I

can't get back in the car with you?"

MALCOLM

(squeezing C.W.'s arm)

No, you tell them nothin', hear?

(hesitates, then)

I made a deal and got you off with

a coupla years!

C.W.

(a piercing treble)

Made a deal with who, Daddy?

119.

MALCOLM

(we can see his own fear)

...the law.  Just don't get back in

that car.

(eyeball to eyeball)

And whatever you do, don't let onto

them, hear?

C.W.

(expletive)

Whew!... You think them laws are

gonna catch Bonnie and Clyde in town?

MALCOLM

What do you think, Clarence?

C.W.

(matter of fact)

They ain't gonna catch 'em.  Don't

matter whether I let on or not.

MALCOLM

(playing along)

Mebbe.  Just you be off'n the

streets of that town when they go

to get in their car.

C.W.

(looking directly at Malcolm)

Nobody catches Clyde.  Clyde's got

a sense, don't you know that, Daddy?

Nobody catches Clyde.

120.

CLYDE

(suddenly)

Bonnie?  Bonnie, will you marry me?

BONNIE

How could I do that, Clyde?  You

know it's impossible.  We'd have to

go to a Justice of the Peace and

the Justice of the Peace is a

lawman.  We couldn't even take out

a license.

CLYDE

(with a chuckle)

Hey now, you sound like you been

givin' it some thought on your own.

BONNIE

(with a grim irony,

her voice getting

more and more emotional)

Oh no, I never gave it thought.  I

haven't thought about it at least

ten times a day, I haven't thought

about it every minute of my life

since I met you.

(suddenly her voice

cracks into tears)

CLYDE

(a bit startled by

this, attempting to

hold her, awkwardly,

and placate her.  He

puts his arm around her)

Bonnie...are you crying, honey?

BONNIE

(her face still

buried in CLYDE's

chest, she whispers)

Clyde, why do you want to marry me?

121.

CLYDE

(in an attempt to be humorous)

To make an honest woman out of you.

BONNIE

(finally, in a voice

charged with

anticipation and dream)

Clyde...what would you do, what

would you do it some miracle

happened and we could walk out

tomorrow morning and start all over

again, clean, with no record, with

nobody after us?

CLYDE

Well...I guess I'd do it all

different.  First off, I wouldn't

live in the same state where we

pull our jobs.  We'd live in one

state and stay clean there, and

when we wanted to take a bank, we'd

go to another state...and...

CLYDE

(continuing)

Bonnie?

CLYDE

Hey, Bonnie?

CUT TO:

122.

CLYDE

(looking around)

What happened to C.W.?

BONNIE

He stopped off in that hardware

store to get light bulbs for his

daddy.

CLYDE

Boy, my feet are sweatin'.

BONNIE

(kidding around)

You plannin' to drive with your

shoes off?

CLYDE

Sure, why not?

CLYDE

Damn!

BONNIE

(laughing)

You gonna wear 'em?

CLYDE

Sure, drive with one eye shut.

123.

BONNIE

(admiring it)

Isn't that the prettiest thing, hon?

Just look here, you can see every

little fingernail on her hands.

CLYDE

It is a pretty thing, honey.

BONNIE

We got any peaches?  I sure could

go for a peach right now.

CLYDE

(he stops drumming

his fingers, suddenly

has an idea)

Whyn't we do it tomorrow?

BONNIE

Do what?

CLYDE

Tomorrow's Sunday, ain't it?  We

could drive all night and be on

that golf course tomorrow morning!

BONNIE

You sure you feel up to it?

CLYDE

(enthused)

Yeah, why not?

(now feeling anxious

and excited, he is

impatient to move)

Where is that boy?  He's gone too

long.

124.

BONNIE

(humming to the radio)

He'll be here.

(holding the peach to him)

You take a bite, hon.

CLYDE

(getting worried)

No, it's takin' too long.  What if

something happened?

BONNIE

Nothin' happened.

CLYDE

(more urgently)

Go take a look, see what's keepin'

him.

BONNIE

He ain't there.

CLYDE

C'mon, let's go.

BONNIE

What's wrong?

CLYDE

I don't know.

125.

HAMER

Barrow!

126.
