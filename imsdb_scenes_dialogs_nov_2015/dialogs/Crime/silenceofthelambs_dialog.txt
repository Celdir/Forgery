THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS

"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS"

by

Ted Tally

Based on the novel by

Thomas Harris

CUT TO:

CLARICE

Freeze! FBI!

BRIGHAM (O.S.)

Okay, people, good exercise...

BRIGHAM

Starling's reaction time was

excellent. Let's break. Critique in

five.

ARDELIA

Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?

CLARICE

(indicating her gun)

Never cock. Just squeeze.

ARDELIA

(grins)

I love it when you talk dirty.

BRIGHAM

What're you laughin' at, Junior G-

Man? She got off four rounds to your

two.

BRIGHAM

(continuing)

One hundred reps, each hand, every

day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief

wants to see you.

CLARICE

What'd I do?

ARDELIA

Stay cool. Just remember to call him

"God."

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD

Starling, Clarice M., good morning.

CLARICE

Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

CRAWFORD

Your instructors tell me you're doing

well. Top quarter of the class.

CLARICE

I hope so. They haven't posted

anything.

CRAWFORD

A job's come up and I thought about

you. Not really a job, more of - an

interesting errand. Walk me to my

car, Starling.

CRAWFORD

We're trying to interview all of the

serial killers now in custody, for a

psychobehavioral profile. Could be a

big help in unsolved cases. Most of

them have been happy to talk to us.

They have a compulsion to boast,

these people... Do you spook easily,

Starling?

CLARICE

Not yet.

CRAWFORD

You see, the one we want most refuses

to cooperate. I want you to go after

him again today, in the asylum.

CLARICE

Who's the subject?

CRAWFORD

The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal

Lecter.

CLARICE

The cannibal...

CLARICE

Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad

for the chance, sir, but - why me?

CRAWFORD

You're qualified and available. And

frankly, I can't spare a real agent

right now.

CRAWFORD

I don't expect him to talk to you,

but I have to be able to say we

tried... Lecter was a brilliant

psychiatrist, and he knows all the

dodges.

(hands her the manila

envelope)

Dossier on him, copy of our

questionnaire, special ID for you...

If he won't talk, then I want straight

reporting. How's he look, how's his

cell look, what's he writing? The

Director himself will see your report,

over your own signature - if I decide

it's good enough. I want that by

0800 Wednesday, and keep this to

yourself.

CRAWFORD

Now. I want your full attention,

Starling. Are you listening to me?

CLARICE

Yes sir.

CRAWFORD

Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go

over the physical procedures used

with him. Do not deviate from them,

for any reason. You tell him nothing

personal, Starling. Believe me, you

don't want Hannibal Lecter inside

your head... Just do your job, but

never forget what he is.

CLARICE

(a bit unnerved)

And what is that, sir?

CHILTON (V.O.)

Oh, he's a monster. A pure

psychopath...

CUT TO:

CHILTON (O.S.)

It's so rare to capture one alive.

From a research point of view, Dr.

Lecter is our most prized asset...

CHILTON

You know, we get a lot of detectives

here, but I must say, I can't ever

remember one so attractive...

CHILTON

Will you be in Baltimore overnight...?

Because this can be quite a fun town,

if you have the right guide.

CLARICE

I'm sure it's a great town, Dr.

Chilton, but my instructions are to

talk to Lecter and report back this

afternoon.

CHILTON

(pause, sourly)

I see.

(beat)

Let's make this quick, then. I'm

busy.

CUT TO:

CHILTON

Lecter carved up nine people - that

we're sure of - and cooked his

favorite bits. We've tried to study

him, of course - but he's much too

sophisticated for the standard tests.

And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm

his nemesis... Crawford's very clever,

isn't he? Using you.

CLARICE

How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?

CHILTON

A pretty young woman, to turn him

on? I don't believe Lecter's ever

seen a woman in eight years. And oh,

are you ever his "taste" - so to

speak.

CLARICE

I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor.

It's not a charm school.

CHILTON

Good. Then you should be able to

remember the rules.

CUT TO:

CHILTON

Do not reach through the bars, do

not touch the bars. You pass him

nothing but soft paper - no pens or

pencils. No staples or paperclips in

his paper. Use the sliding food

carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept

anything he attempts to hold out to

you. Do you understand me?

CLARICE

I understand.

CHILTON

I'm going to show you why we insist

on such precautions... On the

afternoon of July 8, 1981, he

complained of chest pains and was

taken to the dispensary. His

mouthpiece and restraints were removed

for an EKG. When the nurse bent over

him, he did this to her...

CHILTON

The doctors managed to re-set her

jaw, more or less, and save one of

her eyes. His pulse never got over

eighty-five, even when he ate her

tongue.

(pauses, he smiles)

I keep him in here.

CLARICE

(quickly blocking him)

Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're

his enemy - as you've said - then

maybe I'll have more luck by myself.

What do you think?

CHILTON

(annoyed)

You might have suggested that in my

office, and saved me the time.

CLARICE

But then I would've missed the

pleasure of your company.

CHILTON

When she's finished, bring her out.

BARNEY

Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't

get near the bars?

CLARICE

(shaking his hand)

Clarice Starling. Yes, he did.

BARNEY

Okay. Past the others, it's the last

cell. Stay to the middle. I put out

a chair for you.

BARNEY

I'm watching. You'll do fine.

CUT TO:

DARK FIGURE

I c-can sssmell your cunt!

CLARICE

Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice

Starling. May I talk with you?

DR. LECTER

Good morning.

CLARICE

Doctor, we have a hard problem in

psychological profiling. I want to

ask for your help with a

questionnaire.

DR. LECTER

"We" being the Behavioral Science

Unit, at Quantico. You're one of

Jack Crawford's, I expect.

CLARICE

I am, yes.

DR. LECTER

May I see your credentials?

DR. LECTER

Closer, please... Clo-ser...

DR. LECTER

(continuing)

That expires in one week. You're not

real FBI, are you?

CLARICE

I'm - still in training at the

Academy.

DR. LECTER

Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

CLARICE

We're talking about psychology,

Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide

for yourself whether or not I'm

qualified?

DR. LECTER

Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of

you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.

DR. LECTER

Now then. What did Miggs say to you?

(she is puzzled)

"Multiple Miggs," in the next cell.

He hissed at you. What did he say?

CLARICE

He said - "I can smell your cunt."

DR. LECTER

I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan

skin cream, and sometimes you wear

L'Air du Temps, but not today. You

brought your best bag, though, didn't

you?

CLARICE

(beat)

Yes.

DR. LECTER

It's much better than your shoes.

CLARICE

Maybe they'll catch up.

DR. LECTER

I have no doubt of it.

CLARICE

(shifting uncomfortably)

Did you do those drawings, Doctor?

DR. LECTER

Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the

Belvedere. Do you know Florence?

CLARICE

All that detail, just from memory...?

DR. LECTER

Memory, Officer Starling, is what I

have instead of view.

CLARICE

Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -

DR. LECTER

No, no, no. You were doing fine,

you'd been courteous and receptive

to courtesy, you'd established trust

with the embarrassing truth about

Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue

into your questionnaire. It won't

do. It's stupid and boring.

CLARICE

I'm only asking you to look at this,

Doctor. Either you will or you won't.

DR. LECTER

Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed

if he's recruiting help from the

student body. Busy hunting that new

one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty

boy! Did Crawford send you to ask

for my advice on him?

CLARICE

No, I came because we need -

DR. LECTER

How many women has he used, our Bill?

CLARICE

Five... so far.

DR. LECTER

All flayed...?

CLARICE

Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's

an active case, I'm not involved. If -

DR. LECTER

Do you know why he's called Buffalo

Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't

say.

CLARICE

I'll tell you if you'll look at this

form.

(he considers, then

nods)

It started as a bad joke in Kansas

City Homicide. They said... this one

likes to skin his humps.

DR. LECTER

Witless and misleading. Why do you

think he takes their skins, Officer

Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.

CLARICE

It excites him. Most serial killers

keep some sort of trophies.

DR. LECTER

I didn't.

CLARICE

No. You ate yours.

DR. LECTER

Send that through.

DR. LECTER

Oh, Officer Starling... do you think

you can dissect me with this blunt

little tool?

CLARICE

No. I only hoped that your knowledge -

DR. LECTER

You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...?

You know what you look like to me,

with your good bag and your cheap

shoes? You look like a rube. A well-

scrubbed, hustling rube with a little,

taste... Good nutrition has given

you some length of bone, but you're

not more than one generation from

poor white trash, are you Officer

Starling...? That accent you're trying

so desperately to shed - pure West

Virginia. What was your father, dear?

Was he a coal miner? Did he stink of

the lamp...? And oh, how quickly the

boys found you! All those tedious,

sticky fumblings, in the back seats

of cars, while you could only dream

of getting out. Getting anywhere -

yes? Getting all the way - to the

F...B...I.

CLARICE

You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are

you strong enough to point that high-

powered perception at yourself? How

about it...? Look at yourself and

write down the truth.

(she slams the tray

back at him)

Or maybe you're afraid to.

DR. LECTER

You're a tough one, aren't you?

CLARICE

Reasonably so. Yes.

DR. LECTER

And you'd hate to think you were

common. My, wouldn't that sting!

Well you're far from common, Officer

Starling. All you have is the fear

of it.

(beat)

Now please excuse me. Good day.

CLARICE

And the questionnaire...?

DR. LECTER

A census taker once tried to test

me. I ate his liver with some fava

beans and a nice chianti... Fly back

to school, little Starling.

MIGGS

I b-bit my wrist so I c-can diiiieeee!

S-ee how it bleeeeeeeeds?

DR. LECTER (O.S.)

Officer Starling... Officer Starling!

DR. LECTER

I would not have had that happen to

you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably

ugly to me.

CLARICE

Then please - do this test for me.

DR. LECTER

No. But I will make you happy...

I'll give you a chance for what you

love most, Clarice Starling.

CLARICE

What's that, Dr. Lecter?

DR. LECTER

Advancement, of course.

(beat)

Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an

old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T...

Now go. Go.

(a smile)

I don't think Miggs could manage

again so soon, even if he is crazy -

do you?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ARDELIA

Phone call, Clarice. It's God.

CLARICE

Thanks, Ardelia.

ARDELIA

You missed Fourth Amendment law.

Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff.

Where were you all afternoon?

CLARICE

Pleading with a crazy man, with come

all over my face.

ARDELIA

Damn. Wish I had time for a social

life.

CLARICE

(on phone)

Mr. Crawford?

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD

I've read your interim memo on Lecter.

You sure you've left nothing out?

CLARICE

It's all there, sir, practically

verbatim.

CRAWFORD

Every word, Starling? Every gesture?

CLARICE

(a bit heatedly)

Right down to the kleenex I used.

(he is silent)

Sir, why? Is something wrong?

CRAWFORD

He mentioned a name, at the very

end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?

CLARICE

I spent all evening on the mainframe.

Lecter altered or destroyed most of

his patient histories, prior to

capture. No record of anyone named

Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like

it might have have something to do

with divorce. I tracked it down in

the library's catalogue of national

yellow pages.

(glancing at her notes)

It's a mini-storage facility outside

Baltimore, where Lecter had his

practice.

CRAWFORD

Well? Why aren't you there right

now?

CLARICE

Sir, that's a field job. It's outside

the scope of my assignment. And I've

got a test tomorrow on -

CRAWFORD

Do you recall my instructions to

you, Starling? What were they?

CLARICE

To complete and file my report by

0800 Wednesday. But sir -

CRAWFORD

Then do that, Starling. Do just

exactly that.

CLARICE

Sir, what is it? There's something

you're not telling me.

CRAWFORD

(beat)

Miggs has been murdered.

CLARICE

(startled, upset)

Murdered...? How?

CRAWFORD

The orderly heard Lecter whispering

to him, all afternoon, and Miggs

crying. They found him at bed check.

He'd swallowed his own tongue...

Chilton is scared stiff the family

will file a civil rights lawsuit,

and he's trying to blame it on you.

I told the little prick your conduct

was flawless.

(beat)

Starling...?

CLARICE

I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know

how to feel about it.

CRAWFORD

You don't have to feel any way about

it. Lecter did it to amuse himself.

Why not, what can they do? Take away

his books for awhile, and no jello...

(a bit softer)

I know it got ugly today. But this

is your report, Starling - take it

as far as you can. On your own time,

outside of class. Now carry on.

CLARICE

Well God damn it! You old creep.

Creepo son of a bitch. Let Miggs

squirt you and see how you like it.

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD

I'll take over, Patricia. You get

some rest.

DISSOLVE TO:

MR. YOW (V.O.)

Unit 31 was leased for ten years.

Pre-paid in full... The contract is

in the name of "Miss Hester Mofet."

CUT TO:

CLARICE

So no one's been in here since -

1980?

MR. YOW

Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a

great concern to my customers. But,

if you say this is an FBI matter...

CLARICE

I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I

promise. Be gone before you know it.

MR. YOW

We could return tomorrow, with my

son. Or perhaps some workmen...?

CLARICE

Would you hold these, please?

CUT TO:

MR. YOW

It smells like mice... I think I

hear them, too - don't you?

MR. YOW

You're going in there?

CLARICE

Mr. Yow, if this door should fall

down -ha ha! - or anything else -

would you be kind enough to call

this number? It's our Baltimore field

office. They know you're here with

me... Do you understand?

MR. YOW

Might I suggest tucking your pants

into your socks? To prevent mouse

intrusion.

CLARICE

(beat)

Good idea.

MR. YOW (O.S.)

Okay, Miss Starling?

CLARICE

Okay, Mr. Yow...

MR. YOW (O.S.)

You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?

CLARICE

That wasn't me.

MR. YOW (O.S.)

Oh.

CLARICE

Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks

like somebody is sitting in this

car.

MR. YOW (O.S.)

Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better

come out now, Miss Starling.

CLARICE

Not yet! - just wait for me.

(under the breath)

Maybe in about two seconds.

CLARICE

Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas

anymore.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLARICE (O.S.)

It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

CLARICE

Hester Mofet... "The rest of me."

Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you

rented that place.

CLARICE

You put those - things in there.

Paid for it in advance, ten years

ago... Why, Dr. Lecter?

CLARICE

Thank you.

DR. LECTER

Your bleeding has stopped.

CLARICE

How did -

(she stops herself)

It's nothing. A scratch.

DR. LECTER

Why don't you ask me about Buffalo

Bill?

CLARICE

(surprised, a beat)

Why? Do you know something about

him?

DR. LECTER

I might if I saw the case file. You

could get that for me.

CLARICE

Why don't you tell me about "Miss

Mofet?" You wanted me to find him.

Or do I have to wait for the lab?

DR. LECTER

(sighs)

His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A

former patient of mine, whose romantic

attachments ran to, shall we say,

the exotic...? I didn't kill him,

merely tucked him away. Very much as

I found him, in that ridiculous car,

in his own garage, after he's missed

three appointments. You'd have him

under "Missing Person" - which, in

poor Raspail's case, could hardly be

more true.

CLARICE

If you didn't kill him, then who

did?

DR. LECTER

Who can say...? Best thing for him,

really. His therapy was going nowhere.

CLARICE

Wouldn't it have been easier to just

leave him for the police to find?

DR. LECTER

And have them clomping about in my

life? Oh dear, no... At that time I

still had certain private amusements

of my own.

(beat)

How did you feel when you saw him,

Clarice? May I call you Clarice?

CLARICE

Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.

DR. LECTER

Ahhh... Why?

CLARICE

Because you weren't wasting my time.

DR. LECTER

Do you have something you use, when

you need to get up your courage?

Memories, tableaux... scenes from

your early life?

CLARICE

I don't know. Next time I'll have to

check.

DR. LECTER

Jack Crawford is helping your career,

isn't he? Apparently he likes you.

And you like him, too.

CLARICE

I never thought about it.

DR. LECTER

Your first lie to me, Clarice. How

sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford

wants you, sexually? True, he's much

older, but - do you think he

visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...?

Fucking you?

CLARICE

That doesn't interest me, Doctor.

And it's the sort of thing Miggs

would ask.

DR. LECTER

Not anymore.

(beat)

Surely the odd confluence of events

hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford

dangles you before me. Then I give

you a bit of help. Do you think it's

because I like to look at you, and

imagine how good you would taste...?

CLARICE

I don't know. Is it?

DR. LECTER

Or doesn't this all begin to suggest

to you a kind of... negotiation?

There's something Crawford can give

me, and I want to trade for it. I

even wrote to him, offering my help.

But he hates me, so he won't deal

directly.

DR. LECTER

Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just

like that gospel program. When you

leave, they'll turn the volume way

up. Chilton does enjoy his petty

torments.

CLARICE

Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You

know, don't you?

DR. LECTER

I've been in this room for eight

years, Clarice. I know they will

never, ever let me out while I'm

alive. What I want is a view. I want

a window where I can see a tree, or

even water. I want to be in a federal

institution, away from Chilton - and

I want a view. I'll give good value

for it. Crawford could do that for

me, but he won't. You persuade him.

CLARICE

(almost a whisper)

Who killed your patient?

DR. LECTER

Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you

and Jack Crawford are most anxious

to meet.

CLARICE

Buffalo Bill...?

(incredulous)

Bill killed him, all those years

ago...? That's impossible.

DR. LECTER

Who is he stalking right now, Clarice?

I wonder, don't you? How many more

young women will have to die, before

you trade with me...?

DISSOLVE TO:

CATHERINE

This stuff's givin' me the munchies.

Where's that bag of popcorn?

CODY

Shit. Left the groceries in the car.

CATHERINE

'S okay, I'll go.

CUT TO:

CATHERINE

Help you with that?

MAN

Would you? Thanks.

MAN (O.S.)

Let's slide it up, you mind?

CUT TO:

MAN

Are you about a size 14?

CATHERINE

(surprised)

What?

MAN

Good.

MAN

Good.

MAN

Gooood...

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)

Electron microscopy reveals fiber

"signatures" that are nearly as

distinct as fingerprints...

INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)

Both of these blouses were worn by

victims of Buffalo Bill. They were

found in two different states, and

four months apart. He always slits

them up the back, like a funeral

suit...

INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)

The bunching you see - this

compression - is characteristic of

scissor cuts, rather than a single

blade. And, as you see - Bill always

uses the same pair...

BRIGHAM

Clarice Starling! Are you in here?

CUT TO:

BRIGHAM

Get your field gear, take stuff for

overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.

CLARICE

Where?

BRIGHAM

Some fishermen in West Virginia found

an unidentified girl's body. It's a

Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in

the water about a week, and Jack

needs somebody that can print a

floater. Think you can handle it?

CLARICE

(thinking quickly)

I'll need the big fingerprint kit...

and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU-

5, with film packs and batteries.

CUT TO:

BRIGHAM

Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't

he? Impatient...

CLARICE

Sometimes.

BRIGHAM

He's got a lot on his mind besides

Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is

real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin'

you about it now, 'cause he may never.

BRIGHAM

You're goin' in the field, so you

gotta have full kit. Take this -

it's my own...

BRIGHAM

Wear it, don't ever leave it in your

purse. Dry fire it whenever you get

the chance. And do your exercises.

CLARICE

I will... I promise.

BRIGHAM

Listen, I hope you never need a thing

I've taught you. But you've got

something... Jack sees it, I do too.

If you ever need to, you can shoot.

BRIGHAM

Bless you, Starling...

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD (O.S.)

He keeps them alive for three days.

CRAWFORD

Why, we don't yet know... There's no

evidence of rape or physical abuse

prior to death. All the mutilation

you see there is post-mortem.

(a beat; he glances

at her)

I'm hot, are you hot? Bobby, it's

too damned hot back here...

CRAWFORD

So. Three days. Then he shoots them,

skins them - usually just the torsos -

and dumps them. Each body in a

different river, in a different state,

downstream from an interstate highway.

The water leaves us no fingerprints,

fibers, DNA fluids - no trace evidence

at all. That's Fredrica Bimmel, the

first one...

CRAWFORD (O.S.)

A big girl, like all the rest. Went

about 160... Her corpse was the only

one he took the trouble to weight

down, so actually, she was the third

girl found. After her, he got lazy...

CRAWFORD

Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio,

where the Bimmel girl was abducted.

Blue triangle where her body was

found - down here in Missouri. Same

marks for the other four girls, in

different colors. This new one,

today... washed up here.

(he marks with a Flair

pen)

Elk River, in West Virginia, about

six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.

CLARICE

There's no correlation at all between

where they're kidnapped and where

they're found...?

(he shakes his head)

What if - what if you trace the

heaviest-traffic routes backwards

from the dump sites? Do they converge

at all?

CRAWFORD

Good idea, but he thought of it,

too. We've run simulations, using

different vectors and the best dates

we can assign. You put it all in the

computer, and smoke comes out. No,

this one is different. This one has

seen us coming...

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD

Talk about him, Starling. Tell me

what you see.

CLARICE

(choosing her words

carefully)

He's a white male... Serial killers

tend to hunt within their own ethnic

group. And he's not a drifter - he's

got his own house, somewhere. Not an

apartment.

CRAWFORD

Why?

CLARICE

What he does with them - takes

privacy... Time, tools... He's in

his 30's or 40's - he's got real

physical strength, but combined with

an older man's self-control. He's

cautious, precise, never impulsive...

This won't end in suicide, like they

often do.

CRAWFORD

Why not?

CLARICE

He's got a real taste for it now.

And he's getting better at his work.

CRAWFORD

(a beat; impressed)

Maybe you've got a knack for this...

I guess we're about to find out.

CLARICE

(quietly, evenly)

Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?

CRAWFORD

Okay, Starling. Let's have it.

CLARICE

You haven't said a word today about

that garage. Or what I found there.

CRAWFORD

What should I say? You did fine work.

We'll wait on the lab.

CLARICE

You knew. You knew from the start

that Lecter held the key to this...

But you weren't up front with me.

You sent me in to him naked.

CRAWFORD

(beat)

Are you finished?

CLARICE

He starts this - buzzing in me, in

my head. He makes me feel violated...

You used me, Mr. Crawford.

CRAWFORD

Number One. Maybe there's a

connection, maybe not. Lying and

breathing are the same thing to

Lecter. Number Two. If I'd sent you

in there with something to hide from

him, he'd have known it, instantly.

He'd never have trusted you.

CRAWFORD

Number Three, I didn't bring you

along today just because you can do

first-rate forensics. If Lecter is

becoming part of this case, you've

got the most current read on him.

And Number Four - you don't have to

like me, or the way I do things. But

you do have to keep a cool head.

Especially now... Because from here

on out, you'll know everything I do.

Are we straight on that?

CRAWFORD

(softly)

You think about him long enough, you

get a feel for him... Then, if you're

lucky, out of all the stuff you know,

one little part of it tugs at you,

tries to get your attention... You

let me know when that happens,

Starling. Live right behind your

eyes, today. Don't try to impose any

patterns on this guy. Just stay open

and let him show you...

CRAWFORD

School's out, Starling.

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

Starling...?

CRAWFORD

We're around back.

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD

Sheriff Perkins? Jack Crawford, FBI...

This is Officer Starling. We

appreciate your phoning us.

SHERIFF

(grim, unsociable)

I didn't call you. That was somebody

from the state attorney's office...

'For you do a thing else, I'm gon'

find out if this girl's local. It

could just be somethin' that outside

elements has dumped on us.

CRAWFORD

Well sir, that's where we can help.

If -

SHERIFF

I don't even know you, Mister... Now

we'll extend you ever courtesy, just

soon as we can, but for right now -

CRAWFORD

Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex

crime has some aspects I'd rather

discuss just between the two of us.

Know what I mean?

SHERIFF

Oscar, run fetch Dr. Akin from the

chapel. And tell Lamar to come on

when he's done playin' that music.

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD

I need a six-way linkup! Chicago,

Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis,

Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can

you hear me...?

CLARICE

Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen!

Listen here a minute, please. There's

things I need to do for her...

CLARICE (O.S.)

Y'all brought her this far, and I

know her folks would thank you if

they could. Now please - go on out

and let me take care of her... Go

on, now.

CRAWFORD

(on phone)

We're starting. Tell everybody to

stand by for fingerprint transmission.

CLARICE

(pause; softly)

Bill...

DR. AKIN

Wrongful death... She'll have to go

to the state pathologist at Claxton

when you're done.

(Crawford nods)

I better - get on back for the rest

of that service. Lamar'll help you.

(shaken)

Lord almighty...

CRAWFORD

What do you see, Starling?

CLARICE

Well, she's not local. Her ears are

pierced three times each, and she's

wearing green glitter nail polish.

Looks like town to me...

CLARICE (O.S.)

She waxed her legs, I think... A big

girl, just like the others - but she

was careful about her appearance...

CLARICE

Two of the fingernails are broken

off, and there's - dirt or grit under

the others. She tried to claw her

way through something... I'll scrape

out samples after I've printed her.

LAMAR

Them fishhooks are set too close

together. No wonder the Franklin

boys was scared to say they found

her.

CLARICE

Think they were runnin' a trotline?

CLARICE

(to Crawford)

It's a Fish and Game violation. Like

poaching. There's a big fine.

LAMAR

Right... Are you from around here?

CLARICE

They do it lots of places.

CRAWFORD

Get photos of her teeth. Then we'll

fax her fingerprints to Washington,

try to trace her through Missing

Persons.

CLARICE

She's got something in her throat.

LAMAR

When a body comes out of the water,

alots of times there's like, leaves

and things in the mouth.

CRAWFORD

What is it - some kind of seed pod?

LAMAR

Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon. But how

come that to get way down in there?

'Less somebody shoved it in...

CRAWFORD

She'll be easier to print if we turn

her over. Lamar, will you give me a

hand?

LAMAR

Yessir, I will. Clarice takes a jar

from her kit, carefully drops the

cocoon inside.

CRAWFORD (O.S.)

Starling - what do you make of these?

CLARICE

I don't know. I didn't see those on

any of the other girls...

CRAWFORD

They weren't there. Get close-ups.

CUT TO:

CLARICE

Thanks, I'm not thirsty.

LAMAR

No, hold it under your chin, there,

and on your temples. Cold'll make

you feel better. It does me.

CRAWFORD

When I told that sheriff we shouldn't

talk in front of a woman, that really

burned you, didn't it?

(she is silent)

That was just smoke, Starling, I had

to get rid of him. You did well in

there.

CLARICE

It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other

cops know who you are. They look at

you to see how to act... It matters.

CRAWFORD

(beat)

Point taken.

CRAWFORD

When we get back, I want you to run

that bug by the Smithsonian, see if

they can identify it. Maybe it's got

some limited range, or it only breeds

at certain times of year... You found

it, Starling, you deserve the credit.

CLARICE

I'm wondering if he's done that before -

placed a cocoon, or an insect. It

would be easy to miss in an autopsy,

especially with a floater... Can we

check back on that?

CRAWFORD

(shakes his head)

The other girls are in the ground.

Exhumations are upsetting for the

families. I'll do it if I have to,

but -

CLARICE

Then have the lab check Raspail's

head.

(he looks at her)

Dr. Lecter's patient - have them

probe his soft-palette tissues...

They'll find another cocoon.

CRAWFORD

You seem pretty sure of that.

CLARICE

Raspail was killed by the same man

who's killing these girls. And Lecter

knows him. Maybe even treated him...

You think so, too, don't you? Or

you'd never have sent me to that

asylum.

CRAWFORD

Before we caught him, Lecter had a

big psychiatric practice in Baltimore.

But he traveled all over the country -

teaching, consulting... Christ, even

testifying in murder trials. Who

knows how many potential psychos he

turned loose, just for the fun of

it...?

DISSOLVE TO:

MR. GUMB

(softly)

Rub the cream on your skin. Rub it

in gooood...

CATHERINE

Mister... my family will pay cash.

Whatever ransom you're askin' for,

they -

MR. GUMB

Rub it in! Or you'll get the hose

again.

MR. GUMB

Yes, it will, Precious, won't it? It

will get the hose!

CATHERINE

(under her breath)

Oh God... oh God...

CATHERINE

Mister, if you let me go, I won't

press charges, I promise. You've

only had me here a couple days, and -

MR. GUMB (O.S.)

No. Just one day...

CATHERINE

Is that all...? See - see, my mom is

a real important woman... Well, I

guess you already know that. She'll

pay you, no questions asked. Whatever

cause you represent - Iran, Palestine -

she'll see that -

MR. GUMB

Put the bottle in the basket. No

funny business, or you'll be sorry...

CUT TO:

ARDELIA

You better come see this.

CUT TO:

TV ANCHOR (V.O.)

...was listed at first simply as a

missing person, but is now believed

to have been kidnapped by the serial

killer known only as "Buffalo Bill."

TV ANCHOR

Memphis Police sources indicate that

the missing girl's blouse has been

identified, sliced up the back, in

what has become a kind of grim calling

card. Young Catherine Martin, as

we've said, is the only daughter of

U.S. Senator Ruth Martin -

TV ANCHOR (O.S.)

...the Republican junior senator

from Tennessee. And while her

kidnapping is not at this point

considered to be politically

motivated, nevertheless it has stirred

the government -

TV ANCHOR

...to its highest levels, the

president himself being said to be,

and I quote, "intensely concerned."

Just moments ago, Senator Martin

made this dramatic personal plea...

SEN. MARTIN

I'm speaking now to the person who

is holding my daughter. Her name is

Catherine... You have the power to

let Catherine go, unharmed. She's

very gentle and kind - talk to her

and you'll see. Her name is

Catherine...

CLARICE

(whispers)

Boy, is that smart...

ARDELIA

Why does she keep repeating the name?

CLARICE

Somebody's coaching her... They're

trying to make him see Catherine as

a person - not just an object.

SEN. MARTIN

You have a chance to show the whole

world that you can be merciful, as

well as strong. Please - I beg you -

release my Catherine...

2ND TV ANCHOR (V.O.)

Meanwhile. in Memphis, the

investigation continued throughout

the night, as state and local

authorities were joined at the kidnap

scene by agents of the FBI...

ARDELIA

I don't know whether to say "I'm

sorry," or "Congratulations." But

girl? - you just went prime time.

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD

I don't think he knew that she's a

Senator's child. She's a big girl,

Starling, like all the rest. We're

going on the theory she was randomly

targeted by size...

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

By now, Bill's had her for 36 hours.

That leaves us just 36 more, before

he kills her... But maybe, just maybe,

Starling, we caught a real break

this time - thanks to you.

(beat)

We found another bug, in Raspail's

head.

CUT TO:

RODEN (V.O.)

Time, Pilch! My move.

PILCHER (V.O.)

No fair! You lured him with produce.

RODEN

Tough noogies! It's still my turn.

CLARICE (O.S.)

If the beetle moves one of your men,

does that count?

RODEN

Of course it counts. How do you play?

PILCHER

(grins)

Officer Starling. Welcome back.

CUT TO:

RODEN

Where the hell did this one come

from? It's practically mush.

CLARICE

You really don't want to know.

PILCHER

Your West Virginia specimen gave us

quite a bit of trouble, but I finally

managed to narrow his species through

chaetaxy - studying the skin.

RODEN

I'm the one who found his perforating

proboscis! Are you wearing a gun,

right now?

(Clarice nods)

Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?

PILCHER

Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

CUT TO:

RODEN (O.S.)

The whole trick is to remove the

chrysalis without destroying it...

The wings are just like wet tissue

paper...

PILCHER

(without looking up)

What do you do when you're not

detecting, Officer Starling?

CLARICE

I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

PILCHER

Ever get out for cheeseburgers and

beer? The amusing house wine...?

CLARICE

(smiles)

Not lately. But maybe someday.

RODEN

Positive match!

CLARICE

You're sure?

RODEN

(points with his dental

probe)

West Virginia... Baltimore. Officer

Starling, meet Mister Acherontia

Styx.

RODEN (O.S.)

Better known to his friends as the

Death's-head Moth...

PILCHER (O.S.)

The Latin name comes from two rivers

in Hell. Your man - he drops these

girls into rivers, every time. Didn't

I read that?

CLARICE

And there's no way - no natural way -

these could've wound up in the bodies?

PILCHER

(shakes his head)

They live in Malaysia. In this

country, they'd have to be specially

raised, from imported eggs.

CLARICE

(pause, then softly)

Dr. Lecter...

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

Maybe we can trace how he buys the

bugs, starting with U.S. Customs...

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD (O.S.)

Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's

old lovers. Maybe, someday...

CRAWFORD

But for Catherine Martin, it all

comes down to you and Lecter. You're

the one he talks to.

CLARICE

He's already offered to help... What

would happen if we just showed our

cards - asked him for Bill?

CRAWFORD

He offered to help, Starling, not to

snitch. That wouldn't give him enough

chance to show off. Remember, Lecter

looks mainly for fun. Never forget

fun.

CLARICE

But if he knew we have so little

time -

CRAWFORD

If we act too anxious, he'll make us

wait. He'll let the Senator keep

hoping, day after day, until Catherine

finally washes up. That'd be the

most fun of all.

CLARICE

I think he means it, this time. I

think he'll deal.

CRAWFORD

What would it take?

CLARICE

Transfer to a new prison. With a

view of trees, he said, or even

water... Can we swing that?

CRAWFORD

(shakes his head)

State to federal jurisdiction... We

can do it - eventually - but we'll

never get all the clearances in time.

Can you convince him a deal's already

in place?

CLARICE

You'll back me up with some paperwork?

(he nods)

Then I'll try. But wouldn't this

have more weight coming from the

Senator herself?

CRAWFORD

(hesitates)

She doesn't know what we're up to.

And we can't afford to let her find

out.

CRAWFORD

She's the mother, Starling. She can't

possibly comprehend what Lecter is.

She'd make the mistake of pleading

with him. Begging him... He'd feast

on her pain till the last second of

that girl's life...

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

We can't trust Frederick Chilton,

either. He's greedy and ambitious.

If he knew about Lecter's link to

Bill, he's go straight to the

newspapers...

CHILTON

What you're doing, Miss Starling, is

coming into my hospital to conduct

an interview, and refusing to share

information with me. For the third

time!

CLARICE

Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is

just routine follow-up on the Raspail

case.

CHILTON

He's my patient! I have rights!

(grabs her arm,

stopping her)

I'm not just some turnkey, Miss

Starling. I shouldn't even be here

this afternoon. I had a ticket to

Holiday on Ice.

CLARICE

I'm acting on instruction, Dr.

Chilton.

(handing him a card)

This is the U.S. Attorney's number.

Now please - either discuss this

with him, or let me do my job.

CUT TO:

DR. LECTER

Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for

a United States Senator, you're an

odd choice of messenger?

CLARICE

I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You

chose to speak to me. Would you prefer

someone else now? Or perhaps you

don't think you can help us.

DR. LECTER

That is both impudent and untrue...

Tell me, how did you feel when you

viewed our Billy's latest effort?

(beat; he smiles)

Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?

CLARICE

By the book, he's a sadist.

DR. LECTER

Life's too slippery for books,

Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from

the same God.

(beat)

Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was

she a large girl?

CLARICE

Yes.

DR. LECTER

Big through the hips. Roomy.

CLARICE

They all were.

DR. LECTER

Mmm. And what else...?

CLARICE

She had an insect deliberately

inserted in her throat. That hasn't

been made public yet. We don't know

what is means.

DR. LECTER

Was it a butterfly?

CLARICE

(pause; staring at

him)

A moth... How did you predict that?

DR. LECTER

I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice.

Enchant me.

CLARICE

If you help us find Buffalo Bill in

time to save Catherine Martin, the

Senator promises you a transfer to

the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park,

New York, with a view of the woods

nearby. Maximum security still

applies, but you'd have reasonable

access to books.

CLARICE

Best of all, though - one week a

year you'd get to leave the hospital

and go here.

(points to a map)

Plum Island. Every afternoon of that

week you can walk on the beach or

swim in the ocean for up to one hour.

Under SWAT team surveillance, of

course...

CLARICE

Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file,

copy of Senator Martin's terms. Her

offer is final and non-negotiable.

If Catherine dies -

(she slides his tray

through)

You get nothing.

DR. LECTER

"Plum Island Animal Disease Research

Center." Sounds charming.

CLARICE

That's just part of the island. It

has a very nice beach. Terns nest

there.

DR. LECTER

Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it

will be "turns" with us, too. Quid

pro quo. I tell you things, you tell

me things. Not about this case, though -

about yourself. Yes or no?

(she is silent)

Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is

waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...

CLARICE

Go, Doctor.

DR. LECTER

What's your worst memory of childhood?

(she hesitates)

Quicker than that. I'm not interested

in your worst invention.

CLARICE

The death of my father.

DR. LECTER

Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.

CLARICE

He was a town marshal... one night

he surprised two burglars, coming

out the back of a drugstore... They

shot him.

DR. LECTER

Killed outright?

CLARICE

No. He was strong, he lasted almost

a month. My mother - died when I was

very young, so my father had become -

the whole world to me... After he

left me, I had nobody. I was ten

years old.

DR. LECTER

You're very frank, Clarice. I think -

it would be quite something to know

you in private life.

CLARICE

Quid pro quo, Doctor.

DR. LECTER

The significance of the moth is

change. Caterpillar into cocoon into

beauty... Billy wants to change,

too, Clarice. But there's the problem

of his size, you see. Even if he

were a woman, he'd have to be a big

one...

CLARICE

(puzzled)

Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation

in the literature between

transsexualism and violence.

Transsexuals are very passive.

DR. LECTER

Clever girl. You're so close to the

way you're going to catch him - do

you realize that?

CLARICE

No. Tell me why.

DR. LECTER

After your father's death, you were

orphaned. What happened next?

(Clarice drops her

gaze)

I don't imagine the answer's on those

second-rate shoes, Clarice.

CLARICE

I went to live with my mother's cousin

and her husband in Montana. They had

a ranch.

DR. LECTER

A cattle ranch?

CLARICE

Horses - and sheep...

DR. LECTER

How long did you live there?

CLARICE

Two months.

DR. LECTER

Why so briefly?

CLARICE

I - ran away...

DR. LECTER

Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck

you?

CLARICE

(angrily)

No.

DR. LECTER

Did he try to?

CLARICE

No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.

DR. LECTER

Billy's not a real transsexual, but

he thinks he is. He tries to be.

He's tried to be a lot of things, I

expect.

CLARICE

You said - I was very close to the

way we'd catch him.

DR. LECTER

There are three major centers for

transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins,

the University of Minnesota, and

Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't

be surprised if Billy has applied

for sex reassignment at one or all

of them, and been rejected.

CLARICE

On what basis would they reject him?

DR. LECTER

The personality inventories would

trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler,

House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't

test like a real transsexual.

CLARICE

How would he test?

DR. LECTER

That's enough, I think. Happy hunting.

Oh, and Clarice - next time you will

tell me why you ran away. Shall I

summarize?

CLARICE

(shaken)

Yes, Doctor. Please.

CUT TO:

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

You should try to obtain a list of

males rejected from all three gender

reassignment centers...

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

Check first the ones rejected for

lying about criminal records...

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

Among those who tried to conceal

their past, look for severe childhood

disturbances, associated with

violence... Possibly you'll find a

childhood incarceration... Then go

to their personality tests...

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

Study their drawings, especially.

Billy's house drawings will show no

happy future... No baby carriage,

out in the yard. No pets, no toys,

no flowers, no sun...

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

His females will be more crudely

sketched than him males - but he'll

compensate by adding exaggerated

adornments... jewelry, big breasts...

And his tree drawings - oh, his trees

will be frightful...

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

Billy hates his own identity, he

always has - and he thinks that makes

him a transsexual. But his pathology

is a thousand times more savage...

He wants to be reborn, Clarice. He

will be reborn...

CATHERINE (O.S.)

Pleeeeeeeease.....!

DISSOLVE TO:

CHILTON (V.O.)

Bad news, Hannibal...

CHILTON (V.O.)

Gourmet magazine has rejected your

recipe for braised kidneys...

CUT TO:

CHILTON

Perhaps you should have been less

specific about what kind.

(to Barney)

Stand him by the toilet. Then leave

us.

CHILTON

Such a lot of correspondence! I can

hardly wait to analyze it in more

detail... But first things first.

CHILTON

I thought she might be looking for a

civil rights violation in Migg's

death, so I bugged you... Not a word

to me in all these years, Hannibal.

Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff

over here, and you just turn to jelly.

It's too pathetic.

CHILTON

You still think you're going to walk

on some beach, and see the birdies?

I don't think so, Hannibal... I called

Senator Ruth Martin, and she never

heard of any deal with you. She never

heard of Clarice Starling, either.

They scammed you, Hannibal...

CHILTON

When Crawford gets through milking

you, he's giving you to Baltimore

Homicide for the Raspail murder. And

they're preparing some special

surprises for you right now, in my

electroshock room.

CHILTON

The Starling bitch wants you to rot

here, in this little box, till your

teeth fall out and you're soiling

diapers. You've seen the old ones,

Hannibal. They weep when their stewed

peaches get cold. That'll be you,

too. Unless - you trade with me.

CHILTON

There never was a deal with Senator

Martin - but there is now. I've been

on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on

your behalf. Here's what you get: if

you identify Buffalo Bill, and the

girl is found in time, Senator Martin

will have you transferred to Brushy

Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee...

CHILTON (O.S.)

The Governor has already agreed. You

get books, a view of the woods, and

plenty of exercise time...

CHILTON (O.S.)

And best of all, you'd be out of

Jack Crawford's reach, forever. The

Senator will verify these terms on

the phone, and guarantee them in

writing...

CHILTON (O.S.)

In exchange, I get your full

cooperation in publishing a

professional account of this - my

successful interviews with you. You

publish nothing. And I get exclusive

access to any material from Catherine

Martin... So. Do you accept my

demands?

(pause)

Answer me, Hannibal.

CHILTON

You'll answer me now, or by God,

you'll answer to Baltimore Homicide.

Who is Buffalo Bill?

DR. LECTER

(pause; then softly)

I'll tell the Senator herself. But

only in Tennessee...

CUT TO:

DR. DANIELSON

I'm not having a witch hunt here,

Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent,

non-violent people with a real

problem.

CRAWFORD

Dr. Danielson, the man we want was

never your patient. It would be

someone you refused because he tries

to conceal a record of criminal

violence. Please, Doctor - time is

eating us up. Just show me the ones

you've turned away.

DR. DANIELSON

(adamantly)

Examination and interview materials

are confidential. We've never violated

an applicant's trust, and we never

will.

CRAWFORD

You want to see a violation? This is

a violation...

CRAWFORD

Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg,

she was just ID'd. I met her on a

slab in West Virginia. And sometime

tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's

going to do the same thing to

Catherine Martin.

DR. DANIELSON

That's a childish, bullying stunt,

Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield

surgeon, so you can put away your

picture.

BURROUGHS

Phone, Jack. Director Burke.

CRAWFORD

(snaps)

In a minute!

CRAWFORD

Look... search your own records, if

you prefer. You can do it a lot faster

than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo

Bill through your information, I'll

suppress it. Nobody has to know this

hospital cooperated.

DR. DANIELSON

I doubt very much that the FBI or

any other government agency can keep

a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will

out... And then what? Will you give

Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a

big pair of sunglasses on this

building, and a funny nose?

CRAWFORD

Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson.

Very humorous. You like the truth?

Try this.

(right in his face,

enraged)

He kidnaps young women and kills

them and rips their skin off. We

don't want him to do that anymore.

If you don't help me, just as fast

as you can, then the Justice

Department is going to ask publicly

for a court order, We'll ask twice a

day, just in time for the morning

and evening news. And each one of

our press conferences will focus on

Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins,

and how we're still hoping for his

cooperation. And every time there's

any news on the case - when Catherine

Martin floats, when the next one

floats, and the next one - why, we'll

just issue another press release

about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over

at Johns Hopkins - complete with all

his humorous fucking remarks.

DR. DANIELSON

(pause; stiffly)

It may be that - I could confer with

my colleagues on this. And get back

to you.

CRAWFORD

Would you, Doctor? That would be so

kind.

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD

(on phone; stunned)

Transferred...?

CUT TO:

DIRECTOR BURKE

(on phone)

Already airborne for Memphis. Senator

Martin's meeting him at the airport.

(uneasily)

Jack - did you make some sort of

promise to Lecter, in the Senator's

name?

DIRECTOR BURKE

(on phone)

We're going to have to talk about

this, Jack. The Senator's mad as

hell. Paul Krendler's over here from

Justice, she's asking him to take

charge in Memphis... I know that...

But you're still in command of the

task force, and Lecter's plane can

still be ordered back. It's your

call, Jack - but I want it now.

CUT BACK TO:

CRAWFORD

(into phone)

Let him land.

CUT TO:

CLARICE

Chilton has killed her, hasn't he?

That slimy little bastard! We were

so close with Lecter - and now her

last chance is gone.

CRAWFORD

Let's get some coffee and talk.

CUT TO:

CLARICE

Are you in trouble over this, Mr.

Crawford? Can Senator Martin do

something to you?

CRAWFORD

I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy

Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have

to retire in two years. It's not a

consideration. But you are...

(beat)

You've done enough. If I keep you

out of school any longer, you'll be

recycled. Cost you six months, at

least. I can guarantee you readmission

here, but that's about it.

(he stops, looks at

her)

Now's your chance, Starling. Go back

to class. Leave Bill to me.

CLARICE

If you didn't want me chasing him,

you shouldn't have taken me to that

funeral home.

CLARICE

Lecter is still the key, I know he

is. Whatever he told me about Bill

is just as good now as it was before.

CRAWFORD

Or just as worthless. But I want you

in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when

he gets tired of toying with Senator

Martin, he'll talk to you again.

There's a plane waiting for you now

at the airstrip.

CLARICE

I lied to Lecter. I'll need some

kind of peace offering... Can I get

the drawings from his cell?

CRAWFORD

Good idea. Meantime, try to get a

feel for Catherine Martin. Her

apartment, her friends... how he

might've stalked her. I'm going to

the other two clinics, Minnesota and

Ohio.

(he crumples his cup,

tosses it)

Now's the hardest part, Starling.

Use your anger, don't let it keep

you from thinking. Just keep your

eyes on Catherine. We've got less

than 30 hours.

CLARICE

(hesitates)

Mr. Crawford... can those cops down

there handle Dr. Lecter?

CRAWFORD

(grimly)

They'll use their best men. But they

better be paying attention...

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

He will...

BOYLE

Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter. I'm

Officer Boyle, this is Officer Pembry.

We aim to treat you just as nice as

you treat us. Act like a gentlemen,

you'll get three hots and a cot.

PEMBRY

But we ain't pussy-footin' with you,

buddy ruff. You get cute, try to

bite somebody? - we'll tie your

asshole in a knot. You savvy?

DR. LECTER

Oh yes, Officer Pembry. I certainly

do.

PEMBRY

(under his breath)

Shit, he's just an ol' broke-dick.

Won't be no trouble as all if he

don't flip out.

BOYLE

Dr. Chilton...?

BOYLE

If you'll please sign right here,

sir, we'll have us a legal transfer.

BOYLE

Use mine.

PEMBRY

Here they come.

CHILTON

Senator Martin, meet Dr. Hannibal

Lecter.

SEN. MARTIN

Dr. Lecter, I've brought an affidavit

guaranteeing your new rights... You'll

want to read it before I sign.

DR. LECTER

I won't waste your time and

Catherine's time bargaining for petty

privileges. Clarice Starling and

that awful Jack Crawford have wasted

far too much already. I only pray

they haven't doomed the poor girl...

Let me help you now, and I'll trust

you when it's all over.

SEN. MARTIN

You have my word. Paul?

DR. LECTER

Buffalo Bill's real name is William

Rubin. I met him just once. He was

referred to me in April or May, 1980,

by my patient Benjamin Raspail. They

were lovers, but Raspail had become

very frightened. Apparently Rubin

had murdered a transient, and - done

things with the skin. He thought if

I could cure Billy, then Billy'd be

safe from the police, and he's be

safe from Billy... Obviously, he was

wrong.

KRENDLER

We need his address, a physical descr-

DR. LECTER

Did you nurse Catherine?

SEN. MARTIN

(pause; startled)

What...?

DR. LECTER

Did you breast-feed her?

KRENDLER

You son-of-a -

SEN. MARTIN

Yes... I did.

DR. LECTER

Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?

(a beat; then rapidly,

bored)

Six foot one, strongly built, about

190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale

blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said

he lived in Philadelphia, but may

have lied. That's really all I can

remember, Senator - but if I think

of any more, I'll let you know.

SEN. MARTIN

(to the others)

Let's go with it.

DR. LECTER

Senator Martin...! You can't trust

Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling.

It's such a game with these people.

They're determined to get the arrest

for themselves. The "collar," I think

they say.

SEN. MARTIN

Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in

mind.

DR. LECTER

Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.

DISSOLVE TO:

CATHERINE (O.S.)

(muttering, feisty)

Close enough to fuck is close enough

to fight...

CATHERINE

Get my legs round your neck, you

goddamn creep, I'll send you home to

CATHERINE

Okay, Precious. Time for a treat...

CATHERINE

Preeeeecious...! C'mon, boy, nice

yummy bone... c'mon, you little

Hang on, boy... hang on...

CATHERINE

Nooooo...!

SEN. MARTIN

Who are you, please? I thought the

police were through in here.

CLARICE

I'm Clarice Starling, Senator. FBI.

SEN. MARTIN

(softly, very angry)

Clarice Starling...

(calls out)

Paul? Would you come in here,

please...?

SEN. MARTIN

Miss Starling, you may know the Deputy

Attorney General, Mr. Krendler. Paul,

this is the trainee that Jack Crawford

sent to Lecter... She lied to him,

pretending to have my authority, and

thus jeopardized this entire

investigation. Now she has the further

gall to invade my daughter's privacy,

again without permission. If her

little games have killed my baby...

KRENDLER

You're out of line, Starling, and

you're off this case. Back to

Quantico.

CLARICE

Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -

KRENDLER

Your instructions are what I'm giving

you now. Jack Crawford answers to

the Director, and the Director answers

to me. My God, Crawford's losing

it...! He shouldn't even be on this,

with his wife sick as she is... How

the hell did you get in here, anyway?

He gave you - what? Some kind of

special ID? Let's have it.

CLARICE

(stubbornly)

I need the ID to fly with my gun.

The gun belongs in Quantico.

KRENDLER

Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon

as you get back. The gun, too. Be on

the next plane, Starling, there's

one in 90 minutes.

CLARICE

Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts

me. Or at least, he used to. If I

could just -

KRENDLER

Lecter has already named Buffalo

Bill.

KRENDLER

He gave us a perfectly good

description, and we're on it now, so

we won't be needing your little

novelty act any longer - or his,

either. He's under close guard at

the courthouse, pending a prison

transfer. The next plane, Officer.

CLARICE

Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin"

strike you as - I don't know - kind

of vague?

KRENDLER

Do you need a police escort, Starling?

Or do you think you can find the

airport by yourself?

CLARICE

Yes sir. I can find it by myself.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SGT. TATE

Are you with Mr. Krendler's people?

CLARICE

I just left him.

SGT. TATE

Access to Lecter is strictly limited.

We've been getting death threats.

(hesitates again)

Log in, and check your weapon.

MURRAY (V.O.)

Shoot, we haven't had this kinda

security since the President came

through town...

CUT TO:

MURRAY

Every cop in Tennessee wants a look

at this guy. 'Sit true what they're

sayin' - he's some kinda vampire?

CLARICE

(beat)

I don't have a name for what he is.

CUT TO:

PEMBRY

You know the rules, ma'am?

CLARICE

Yes, Officer Pembry. I've questioned

him before.

DR. LECTER

(without turning)

Good afternoon, Clarice.

CLARICE

I thought you might want your drawings

back... Just until you get your view.

DR. LECTER

How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford

send you here for one last wheedle -

before you're both booted off the

case?

CLARICE

Nobody sent me. I came on my own.

DR. LECTER

People will say we're in love.

(beat)

Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it?

Pity for poor Catherine. Tick-tock...

CLARICE

Dr. Lecter, you find out everything.

You couldn't have talked with this

"William Rubin", even once, and come

out knowing so little about him...

You made him up, didn't you?

DR. LECTER

Clarice... you're hardly in a position

to accuse me of lying.

CLARICE

I think you were telling me the truth

in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell

me the rest now.

DR. LECTER

I've studied the case file, have

you...? Everything you need to find

him is right in these pages. Whatever

his name is.

CLARICE

Then tell me how.

DR. LECTER

First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each

particular thing, ask: What is it,

in itself, what is its nature...?

What does he do, this man you seek?

CLARICE

He kills w-

DR. LECTER

(sharply, as he stops)

No! That's incidental.

DR. LECTER

What is the first and principal thing

he does, what need does he serve by

killing?

CLARICE

Anger, social resentment, sexual

frus-

DR. LECTER

No, he covets. That's his nature.

And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

Do we seek out things to covet? Make

an effort to answer.

CLARICE

No. We just -

DR. LECTER

No. Precisely. We begin by coveting

what we see every day. Don't you

feel eyes moving over your body,

Clarice? I hardly see how you

couldn't. And don't your eyes move

over the things you want?

CLARICE

All right, then tell me how -

DR. LECTER

No. It's your turn to tell me,

Clarice. You don't have any more

vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island.

Why did you run away from that ranch?

CLARICE

Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -

DR. LECTER

We don't reckon time the same way,

Clarice. This is all the time you'll

ever have.

CLARICE

Later, listen, I'll -

DR. LECTER

I'll listen now. After your father's

murder, you were orphaned. You were

ten years old. You went to live with

cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch

in Montana. And - ?

CLARICE

And - one morning I just - ran away...

DR. LECTER

Not "just," Clarice. What set you

off? You started what time?

CLARICE

Early. Still dark.

DR. LECTER

Then something woke you. What? Did

you dream...? What was it?

CLARICE (V.O.)

I heard a strange sound...

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

What was it?

CLARICE (V.O.)

I didn't know. I went to look...

CLARICE (V.O.)

Screaming! Some kind of - screaming.

Like a child's voice...

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

What did you do?

CLARICE (V.O.)

Got dressed without turning on the

light. I went downstairs... outside...

CLARICE (V.O.)

I crept up to the barn... I was so

scared to look inside - but I had

to...

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

And what did you see, Clarice?

CLARICE (V.O.)

Lambs. The lambs were screaming...

DR. LECTER

They were slaughtering the spring

lambs?

CLARICE

Yes...! They were screaming.

DR. LECTER

So you ran away...

CLARICE

No. First I tried to free them... I

opened the gate of their pen - but

they wouldn't run. They just stood

there, confused. They wouldn't run...

DR. LECTER

But you could. You did.

CLARICE

I took one lamb. And I ran away, as

fast as I could...

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

Where were you going?

CLARICE (V.O.)

I don't know. I had no food or water.

It was very cold. I thought - if I

can even save just one... but he got

so heavy. So heavy...

CLARICE (V.O.)

I didn't get more than a few miles

before the sheriff's car found me.

The rancher was so angry he sent me

to live at the Lutheran orphanage in

Bozeman. I never saw the ranch

again...

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

But what became of your lamb?

(no response)

Clarice...?

DR. LECTER

You still wake up sometimes, don't

you? Wake up in the dark, with the

lambs screaming?

CLARICE

Yes...

DR. LECTER

Do you think if you saved Catherine,

you could make them stop...? Do you

think, if Catherine lives, you won't

wake up in the dark, ever again, to

the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?

CLARICE

Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.

DR. LECTER

(a pause; then, oddly

at peace)

Thank you, Clarice.

CLARICE

(a whisper)

Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.

DR. LECTER

Dr. Chilton... I believe you know

each other?

CHILTON

Out. Let's go.

PEMBRY

Sorry, ma'a m - we've got orders to

have you put on a place.

DR. LECTER

Brave Clarice. Will you let me know

if ever the lambs stop screaming?

CLARICE

(moving closer to the

bars)

Yes. I'll tell you.

DR. LECTER

Promise...?

(she nods. He smiles)

Then why not take your case file? I

won't be needing it anymore.

DR. LECTER

Good-bye, Clarice.

DISSOLVE TO:

FOREMAN

Hello, dear! Punctual as always. And

what have you brought us today?

FOREMAN

Oh, marvelous... You know, I always

MR. GUMB (O.S.)

Oil.

FOREMAN

Pardon...?

MR. GUMB (O.S.)

You're leaving oil on the skin.

Sumbitch demanded lamb chops for

What you reckon he'll want for

breakfast - some fuckin' thing from

Okay, Doc, grab some floor. Same

DR. LECTER

I'm ready when you are, Officer

Pembry.

SGT. TATE

What is this shit...? Did somebody

go up to five?

(Jacobs shakes his

head)

Call Pembry, ask him what -

SGT. TATE

CP, shots fired on five! Repeat,

shots fires on five! Outside posts

look sharp, we've got a... Ho-ly

shit.

SGT. TATE

SHUT UP...! Guard mount, double up

on your outside posts. Bobby, get

the vests. Rainey, Howard, cover

that fucking elevator if it comes

all the way to -

A COP (O.S.)

It stopped!

SGT. TATE

Seal off a ten-block radius. Get me

the SWAT team and an ambulance, double

SGT. TATE

Oh no... no...

SGT. TATE

Command post... Two offi-

throat)

Two officers down. Prisoner is

missing. Repeat, Lecter is missing...

He's stripped the bed, might be making

a rope, check all windows. Where the

fuck is my ambulance?

JACOBS

Boyle is dead, Sarge. His gun's

gone...

MURRAY

This one's alive!

SGT. TATE

Take ahold of him where he can feel

your hands, son. Talk to him.

MURRAY

What's his name, Sarge?

SGT. TATE

It's Pembry, now talk to him, God

dammit.

(into radio, looking

around)

Boyle's dead, Pembry's read bad.

Lecter is missing and armed - he

took Boyle's gun...

SGT. TATE

(into radio)

Pembry got off one round - there's a

chance Lecter was hit. We heard a

total of three shots fired, so he's

got four left... He's got a knife,

too.

MURRAY

You're just fine, Pembry, lookin'

good, buddy, you're gonna make it...

ORDERLY

Downstairs - let's go!

CUT TO:

SGT. TATE

Ten-four, Lieutenant. I'm on the

elevator, bringing it down. Pembry

floors secured, main stairwell

secured. He's somewhere on -

SGT. TATE

Uh, we're pretty sure he's somewhere

on two, sir... That's all for now,

over.

CUT TO:

SGT. TATE

(whispers)

He's on the roof of the elevator!

CUT TO:

PETERSON

I see him... There's a weapon by his

hand. He's not moving...

RADIO VOICE

Can you get the drop?

PETERSON

We got the drop.

RADIO VOICE

One warning. Then take him out.

PETERSON

Quinn!! put your hands on your head!!

PETERSON

Put one in his leg.

PETERSON

No movement.

Okay, Johnny, hold your fire...

SWAT COMMANDER

That's Pembry!

ARDELIA

In the parking garage at Memphis

airport. The crew was dead. He killed

a tourist, too. Got his clothes,

cash... By now he could be anywhere.

CLARICE

No. He won't come after me.

ARDELIA

Why not?

CLARICE

(bitterly)

It would be rude. And he wouldn't

get to ask any more questions...

ARDELIA

Clarice - you did the best anybody

could have for Catherine Martin. You

stuck your neck out for her and you

got your butt kicked for her and you

tried. It's not your fault it ended

this way.

CLARICE

The worst part - the thing that's

making me crazy - is that Bill is

right in front of me. Only I can't

see him...

(touching the case

file)

Lecter said, everything I need to

catch him is right here, in these

pages...

ARDELIA

Lecter said a lot of things.

CLARICE

(shakes her head)

He's here, Ardelia.

CUT TO:

ARDELIA

(surprised)

Hey, is this Lecter's handwriting?

She holds up the map, with its

location markings for the kidnapping

and body dump sites. Clarice takes

it, looks.

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

Clarice, doesn't this random

scattering of sites seem overdone to

you? Doesn't it seem desperately

random - like the elaborations of a

bad liar? Ta... Hannibal Lecter.

CLARICE

"Desperately random." What does he

mean?

ARDELIA

Not random at all, maybe. Like there's

some pattern here...?

CLARICE

But there is no pattern. There's no

connection at all among these places,

or the computers would've nailed it!

They're even found in random order.

ARDELIA

Well, except for the one girl.

CLARICE

(beat)

What girl?

ARDELIA

The one that was weighted down. Where

is she...? Fred something.

CLARICE

Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere,

Ohio. The first girl taken, but the

third body found... Why?

ARDELIA

'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted

her down.

CLARICE

But why? He didn't weight the others.

CLARICE

The first, what the hell did Lecter

say about... "First principles," he

said. Simplicity... What does this

guy do, he "covets." How do we first

start to covet? "We covet what we

see -"

CLARICE

"- every day."

ARDELIA

(softly)

Hot damn, Clarice.

CLARICE (V.O.)

He knew her...!

CUT TO:

CLARICE

Maybe he lives in this, this

Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw

her every day, and killed her sort

of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant

to... give her a 7-Up and talk about

the choir. But then -

KRENDLER

Starling -

CLARICE

But then he had to cover up, make

her seem just like all the rest of

them. That's what Lecter was hinting!

KRENDLER

The market in Lecter hints is way

down, today, okay? I've got two good

men dead in Memphis, and three

civilians. I've got -

CRAWFORD

Who the hell's fault is -

KRENDLER

- a U.S. Senator who's half out of

her head because her daughter's going

to be murdered today! And all because

of your mind games with fucking

Lecter!

CRAWFORD

If you hadn't interfered, he'd still

be in custody in Baltimore!

BURKE

Jack -

KRENDLER

You sent in a green recruit, with a

phony goddamn offer -

CRAWFORD

You're just trying to cover your ass

for letting him escape!

BURKE

THAT'S ENOUGH! All of you...

BURKE

(very reluctantly)

Starling, I'm afraid I have no choice.

You're suspended from the Academy.

(Crawford starts to

interrupt)

Not another word!

(to Clarice)

This is pending a reevaluation of

your fitness for the service. I

promise you'll get a fair hearing.

(pause)

Jack... you're ordered to take

compassionate leave. You'll spend

the rest of the day briefing the

AG's office, then transfer command

of the task force, effective by 1800

hours.

(beat)

I'm sorry, Jack... Go home. Take

care of Bella.

CUT TO:

CLARICE

All his victims are women... His

obsession is women, he lives to hunt

women. But not one women is hunting

him - except me. I can walk in a

woman's room and know three times as

much about her as a man would.

(beat)

I have to go to Belvedere.

CRAWFORD

You heard them. I don't have that

authority anymore.

CLARICE

You do until six p.m.

CRAWFORD

Ohio is cold ground. Picked over,

ten months ago. Our people worked

it, so did the locals.

CLARICE

But not from this angle. Not thinking

he knew her. You've got to send me!

CRAWFORD

I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I

won't disobey orders, not even now.

CLARICE

But I just became a private citizen.

I can go anywhere I want to.

CRAWFORD

With ID and a gun...? Impersonating

a federal agent is a felony.

CLARICE

He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford.

This morning, or maybe at noon, but

today, and Belvedere's our last

chance. I'm flying there, right now,

unless you stop me. You want my ID?

Here - take it...

CRAWFORD

(pulls out his wallet)

There's about $300 here... And a

hotline code number. They'll patch

you through to me, wherever I am.

CLARICE

Thank you.

Even if he were a woman, he'd have

to be a big one...

CLARICE

Sewing darts. You bastard.

CUT TO:

CLARICE

(into phone)

He's making himself a "woman suit,"

Mr. Crawford - out of real women!

And he can sew, this guy, he's really

skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

Starling -

CLARICE

That's why they're all so big -

because he needs a lot of skin! He

keeps them alive to starve them awhile -

to loosen their skin, so that -

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

Starling, we know who he is! And

where he is. We're on our way now.

CLARICE

(pause; surprised)

Where?

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD

(into speaker phone)

Calumet City, edge of Chicago. I'll

be on the ground in 45 minutes with

the Hostage Rescue Team. I'm back in

charge, Starling. He's mine.

CLARICE

(on phone)

Sir, that's great news. But how -

CRAWFORD

Johns Hopkins finally came up with a

name for us. We fed him into Known

Offenders, and he came up cherries.

(takes a paper from

Burroughs)

Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA

"John Grant." Lecter's description

was accurate, he just lied about the

name.

CRAWFORD (O.S.)

This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered

both his grandparents when he was

twelve, and did nine years in juvenile

psychiatric. Where, Starling, he

took vocational rehab, and learned a

useful trade...

CLARICE

Sewing...

CRAWFORD

Take a bow. Customs had some paper

on his alias. They stopped a carton

two years ago at LAX - live

caterpillars from Surinam. The

addressee was "John Grant." Calumet

Power & Light's given us two possible

residences under that alias. We're

hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking

the other.

CLARICE

(eagerly)

Chicago's only about 400 miles from

here. I could be there in -

CRAWFORD

No, Starling, there isn't time. And

you've still got crucial work to do

in Ohio. We want him for murder, not

kidnapping. I'm counting on you to

link him to the Bimmel girl, before

he's indicted.

CLARICE

Yes sir... I'll do my best.

CRAWFORD

(pause; gently)

Starling - you've earned back your

place in the Academy. We never

would've found him without you, and

nobody's ever going to forget that.

Least of all me.

CLARICE

Yes sir. Thank you, sir...

BURROUGHS (O.S.)

Here he comes, Jack.

CUT TO:

CLARICE

Mr. Bimmel... did Fredrica ever

mention a man named Jamie Gumb, from

Calumet City? Or John Grant?

(he shakes his head)

Did she know any men that sew?

MR. BIMMEL

She sewed for everybody. Stores,

ladies, whatever. I don't know about

men.

CLARICE

Who was her best friend, Mr. Bimmel?

Who'd she hang out with?

CUT TO:

STACY (V.O.)

Freaked me out. Get your skin peeled

off, is that a bummer...?

CUT TO:

STACY

They said she was just rags, like

somebody -

CLARICE

Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a

man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?

(Stacy shakes her

head)

Do you think she could've had a friend

you didn't know about?

STACY

No way. She had a guy, I'da known,

believe me. Sewing was her life, she

was really great at it. Poor Freddie.

CLARICE

Did you ever work with her?

STACY

Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to

help her do alterations for old Mrs.

Lippman. Lots of people worked for

her, she had the business from all

these retail stores? But she was

like, totally old, it was more'n she

could handle.

CLARICE

Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd

like to talk to her.

STACY

She died. She went to Florida to

retire, like two years ago? She dies

own there.

STACY

(beat; shyly)

Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?

CLARICE

I think so.

STACY

You get to travel around and stuff?

I mean, better places then this?

CLARICE

Sometimes you do.

STACY

Freddie was so happy for me when I

got this job. This - toaster

giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the

speakers all day - she thought this

was really hot shit. What did she

know, big dummy...

Good afternoon... I wonder if you

could help me. I'm looking for Mrs.

Lippman's family?

MR. GUMB

They don't live here anymore.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLARICE

Excuse me, but I really do need to

talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's

house. Did you know her?

MR. GUMB

(beat)

Just briefly. What's the problem,

Officer?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CLARICE

I'm investigating the death of

Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?

MR. GUMB

Jack Gordon.

CLARICE

Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica

when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?

MR. GUMB

No. Wait... Was she a great, fat

person? I may have seen her, I'm not

sure...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MR. GUMB

Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he

could help you. I have his card

somewhere. Do you mind stepping

inside, while I looks for it?

CLARICE

Thanks.

CUT TO:

CRAWFORD

Clarice.

CUT TO:

MR. GUMB (O.S.)

That horrible business, I shiver

every time I think about it...

MR. GUMB

Are they close to catching somebody,

do you think?

CLARICE

I think we may be, yes.

CLARICE

Mr. Gordon, did you take over this

place after Mrs. Lippman died?

MR. GUMB

Yes. I bought the house from her,

two years ago.

CLARICE

Did she leave any records here? Tax

or business records? Maybe a list of

employees?

MR. GUMB

No, nothing at all. Has the FBI

learned something? Because the police

here don't seem to have the first

clue...

MR. GUMB

Do you have his description yet, or

some fingerprints...?

CLARICE

No... no, we don't.

MR. GUMB

Ahhh. Here's that number.

CLARICE

Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you

have a phone I can use?

MR. GUMB

(softly)

In the kitchen. I'll show you.

CLARICE

Freeze!

CLARICE

Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under

arrest. Down on the floor, hands and

legs spread, move it.

CLARICE

Shit!

CUT TO:

CLARICE

FBI, Catherine, you're safe.

CATHERINE

Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout.

GET ME OUT!

CLARICE

You're all right! Where is he?

CATHERINE

Get me out!

CLARICE

I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I

can hear. Shut that dog up.

(still swivelling)

Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?

CATHERINE

I don't know! Get me out!!

CLARICE

Catherine. Listen to me. I have to

find a rope. I have to leave this

room, just for a minute, but -

CATHERINE

NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you

LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU

CLARICE

Shut UP!

(then, louder)

The other officers will be here any

minute! you're perfectly safe now!

Congratulations! You are now officers

Investigation...

ARDELIA

Agent Starling! Telephone!

CLARICE

(surprised)

Agent Mapp! Thank you!

RODEN

Hel-lo, gorgeous! Let's get down.

PILCHER

Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

CUT TO:

CLARICE

Starling.

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped

screaming...?

DR. LECTER (V.O.)

Don't bother with a trace, I won't

be on long enough.

CLARICE

Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

CUT TO:

DR. LECTER (O.S.)

Where I have a view, Clarice...

DR. LECTER (O.S.)

Orion is looking splendid tonight,

and Arcturus, the Herdsman, with his

flock...

DR. LECTER

(into phone)

Your lambs are still for now, Clarice,

but not forever... You'll have to

earn it again and again, this blessed

silence. Because it's the plight

that drives you, and the plight will

never end.

CLARICE

Dr. Lecter -

DR. LECTER

I have no plans to call on you,

Clarice, the world being more

interesting with you in it. Be sure

you extend me the same courtesy.

CLARICE (V.O.)

You know I can't make that promise.

DR. LECTER

Goodbye, Clarice...

(and then, softly)

You looked - so very lovely today,

in your blue suit.

CUT TO:

CLARICE

Dr. Lecter... Dr. Lecter...!

CUT BACK TO:

DR. LECTER

Well, Dr. Chilton. Shall we begin?

FADE OUT
