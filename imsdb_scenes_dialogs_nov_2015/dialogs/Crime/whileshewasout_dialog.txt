MAP GRIDS

From the pages of a Thomas guide converge, overlap and re-

configure across the screen. The endlessly ironic names of

American suburbs parade before us, their violet territories

marching forward like a bruise into dark green patches of

forest and wilderness.

Closer in on one last map grid which fades into a

transparency of itself overlaid across the actual location of

the suburb. The name of this housing development is "Pleasant

Valley". The transparency fades out to reveal:

1                                                                 1

EXT.   PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING

From a sign reading "Pleasant Valley Dream Homes", a picture

postcard boulevard of mini mansions curves into infinity.

Each home is brand new. Each has the same size lawn, the same

shrubs, the same satellite dish. Each has an

indistinguishable car parked in the driveway.

All the homes have Christmas decorations, Christmas trees

with baubles, lights and Christmas stars sitting proudly at

the top. The doors have Christmas wreaths.

The sheen of a recent rainfall makes all the surfaces glimmer

in the lights.

We halt outside one house.

2                                                                 2

EXT.   DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING

This home too seems perfect until we notice the Christmas

star has fallen from the top of the tree and lies reflecting

itself in a puddle on the wet lawn.

Suddenly we hear the sound of wings fluttering and see an owl

among the branches of the Christmas tree. It rises from the

tree then swoops down to the lawn where it sweeps a mouse

from the grass. The owl then soars off, casting a magnified

shadow of her wings across the house, and disappears with

it's prey into the woods behind.

Curtains part at a downstairs window. The silhouette of a man

appears bathed in the blue glow of a computer screen. He

draws the curtains once again and disappears.

INT. DELLA'S HOUSE/ KENNETH'S MEDIA ROOM - EVENING

We sneak between curtain and window ledge into a home office

fitted out with a flat screen TV and a computer.

Scene 3 Page 2

KENNETH, a forty something ex-jock with a once handsome face,

pours a beer into a crystal brandy glass. Kenneth's eyes are

glued to the computer screen where stock numbers scroll

endlessly down. He highlights a set of numbers and stands up

abruptly from his chair elated.

KENNETH

Yes!

Steps back onto a A CHILD'S DOLL, crushing it underfoot. His

ebullient mood changes quickly.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

Damn! DELLA!

The sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening.

DELLA peers into the room. She's a diminutive blonde in her

thirties with fine features and a fading Southern accent.

She's pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans.

She sees the broken doll.

DELLA

SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's

favorite doll.

She walks in, picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed

face. He turns back to the computer guiltily, takes a sip of

beer.

KENNETH

You should just swear properly and

get it over with. Do you think the

kids don't know what you mean?

Close up, his face is ruddy - the face of someone who drinks

too much. He turns back towards her. She ignores him,

continues to try fix the doll. His eyes linger on her coat.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

Going out again? What is it

tonight? Auto Mechanics for

Dummies? The bored housewives'

reading group?

He averts his eyes back to the screen then turns back to look

at her once more.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

I got a new one for you.

He smiles sardonically.

Scene 3 Page 3

KENNETH (CONT'D)

Group therapy for women who always

have the curse. There's a Tuesday

night class at the Pleasant Valley

Episcopalian.

Kenneth clearly thinks he's funny. Della glares a warning at

him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping

from her mouth.

DELLA

I'm going to the mall for wrapping

paper.

A trail of kids mess in the hallway behind Della catches

Kenneth's eye.

KENNETH

What do you do all day, Della

honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping

house. This place is an eyesore.

I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs

for this?

His sad eyes meet hers in confrontation. Della, determined

not to engage, averts hers. Kenneth, unable to contain

himself, faces her.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

I mean it's not like you're at some

salon fancying up your hair or

nails like the other men's wives.

He lifts a strand of her limp fair hair and lets it drop,

looks right in her tired face.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

The last time I saw you wearing

something sexy was our engagement

party. God, Della, you used to be

hot!

She bites her lip again, but this time to try stop the tears.

He turns away, in an attempt to conceal his own sadness.

She walks away clutching the doll.

DELLA

Put the twins to bed by eight. Give

them a chocolate cookie with their

milk.

Scene 3 Page 4

KENNETH

Jesus, Della. Della honey, I'm

sorry.

But she's already left the room. He watches her pick up a set

of car keys from a dresser in the dimly lit hallway. Her

knuckles are white as she clenches her fingers around them.

Kenneth turns back to his computer.

4                                                                     4

INT. STAIRS - EVENING

Della climbs the stairs. Framed photographs on the wall tell

the public story of her life. The engagement to Kenneth,

their wedding, the birth of the twins, Kenneth's graduation,

Kenneth as a sixth grade football star, Della on the farm in

Ohio with her horse, a really young Della playing baseball

with her father. We linger on a photo of a very pretty twenty

something Della in a little black dress.

5                                                                     5

INT. THE TWINS BEDROOM - EVENING

TERRI and TAMMI are seven year old twins with the delicate

blue eyed blonde looks of their Mother.

Della stands in the doorway and watches them.

Tammi is lying on her girlish bed drawing with crayons.

Terri's toy dinosaurs are destroying Tammi's heirloom dolls

house, starting with the furniture.

She steps into the room.

TAMMI

Mommy can I get an American Girl

for Christmas?

TERRI

I want a raptor dinosaur, Mommy.

DELLA

You better leave Santa a note. It's

only three days until Christmas.

She gives them each a kiss, breathing in their scent she

loves so much.

TAMMI

Where are you going, Mommy?

Scene 5 Page 5

DELLA

The Mall. One chocolate cookie each

and then Daddy will read you a

bedtime story.

TAMMI

Daddy's stories are lame. I want

you to read us a story.

TERRI

Yeah Mommy, the one about the

pirates.

TAMMI

No, the cowgirls. Diamond Lil and

Slingshot Kitty.

DELLA

Tomorrow night I'll read you the

best bedtime story in the whole

world. I promise.

Della gives them a little wave and turns to leave.

DELLA (CONT'D)

I'll check in on you both when I

get back.

(beat)

To make sure you're sleeping.

She smiles. Terri's already turned back to his dinosaurs.

Tammi runs toward her and gives her the drawing she's been

working on. It's a drawing of a stick figure family holding

hands. The words "Mommy, we love you" are written across a

cloudy night sky like big stars.

DELLA (CONT'D)

Thank you, Tammi, it's wonderful.

Della doesn't have time to look at it properly so she folds

the drawing up and puts it in her pocket. She kisses Tammi

again and turns to leave. Tammi's eyes follow her mother as

she walks away.

6                                                                     6

INT.   STAIRWAY - EVENING

Della checks her watch and hurries down the stairs.

7                                                                     7

INT.   HALLWAY - EVENING

She sits on the bottom stair to pull on a pair of boots. The

boots are well worn but polished to a gleam.

Scene 7 Page 6

Behind her, an antique grandfather clock strikes seven p.m.

The sound of gun shots fades in from the TV in Kenneth's

office.

8                                                                     8

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

Della collects a packet of cookies from a cabinet. She looks

at the pile of dirty dinner dishes in the sink then looks

away.

9                                                                     9

INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING

Della leaves the cookies at the bottom of the stairs and

opens the front door. The TV blares out some action flick

from Kenneth's ajar door.

EXT.    DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING

Della is met by a blast of cold evening air and the eerie

silence of the suburbs. She closes the door softly behind her

and rushes along the path to the driveway where the family's

black Ford Explorer is parked.

She CHIRPS the remote and quickly climbs in.

11                                                                   11

INT.    FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Della inserts the key and turns it in the lock.    The car

sputters in defiance against the cold night.

DELLA

Frick!

The car sputters again.

DELLA (CONT'D)

C'MON...

With a massive exertion, the car engine turns over and the

vehicle starts. She sighs with relief.

She turns the heat up high and warms her hands at the vent,

pauses to look at her home through the car window. For a

second, in an upstairs window, she sees a reflection of

Tammi.

She smiles, then looks at the house and lawn and the

Christmas tree. She notices the fallen star, is about to get

out of the car to retrieve it, but decides it's too cold.

honey. AFTER you stop drinking.

DELLA

Hello?

MARY (V.O.)

Della, it's Mary Messina.

DELLA

Oh, hey.

MARY (V.O.)

You okay sweetie?

DELLA

Sure. How are you?

MARY (V.O.)

I'm well.

DELLA

How'd you get my cell number?

MARY (V.O.)

I called Kenneth at the house.

Scene 18Page 9

DELLA

And how'd that go? Did he give you

an earful for disturbing his ninety

ninth viewing of Lethal Weapon

Four?

Mary giggles.

MARY (V.O.)

Oh Della. Kenneth is always

charming. At least to me.

The car flashes past the decorated sign for a local school.

Before Della can stop herself, the words are out.

DELLA

Well, with the way you flaunt your

double D boob job at the free fun

PTA events that's hardly a

surprise.

Fortunately for her the phone happens to make a deep metallic

distortion at that moment.

MARY (V.O.)

What was that?

DELLA

Oh nothing, Mary.

MARY (V.O.)

You got lucky with that one.

Patricia Ellis says he's the best

looking guy in Pleasant Valley.

DELLA

Well that wouldn't be hard.

Mary, do you need something? Cause

I gotta go.

MARY (V.O.)

Yes, are you going to Tool School

tomorrow?

Mary giggles at her own joke.

Della sighs.    THIS is why she is having her serenity

interrupted?

Scene 18Page 10

DELLA

TOOL SCHOOL?, Ouch, Mary. Do It

Yourself Mechanics is without a

doubt the most interesting thing in

my life right now.

(Smiles)

I carry my beloved toolbox in the

trunk at all times.

MARY (V.O.)

I'm just joking, Della. You know

me. I pre-paid ten classes and only

made it to two. If you are going I

could use a ride. I'd hate to miss

another class.

DELLA

Sorry, Mary, I'm skipping this

week. Kenneth's parents are coming

to stay for Christmas. You know how

it is.

MARY (V.O.)

Oh that's too bad. Maybe Patricia

Ellis will be going.

DELLA

You check with her, Mary.

MARY (V.O.)

Merry Christmas. God bless you and

your family.

DELLA

You too.

(Under her breath)

Bah Humbug.

MARY (V.O.)

Pardon?

DELLA

Bye, Mary.

MEGHAN (V.O.)

Everyone misses that class at least

once.

Scene 20Page 13

DELLA

I guess some people find it boring.

MEGHAN (V.O.)

We'll see you the first week in

Yes you will...unless I run off and

become an outlaw or something.

I have to go.

MEGHAN

You too.

Just a minute, Della.

I almost rear-ended a car. Cassie?

DELLA (CONT'D)

What's up, Cassie?

CASSIE (V.O.)

I'm over at Southeast Plaza. What

was it we need to get for Pilates?

DELLA

Huh? One of those rubber balls, I

think. I'm headed over there now.

Ran out of Christmas wrapping

paper. Would you believe it?

CASSIE (V.O.)

It's hell here tonight. Everyone

and their uncle is at the mall.

DELLA

Aw shoot. My cell battery's dying.

DELLA (CONT'D)

Damn, I must have left the charger

in the other car.

Scene 21Page 15

CASSIE (V.O.)

You want me to pick up something

for you while I'm here?

DELLA

No....I'm just. I mean I'm. Oh

nothing.

CASSIE (V.O.)

Your phone's breaking up Della. I'm

not joking when I say it's packed

over here.

DELLA

It can't be that bad?

DELLA (CONT'D)

Why don't we meet somewhere for a

drink?

CASSIE (V.O.)

Sure, but a latte's about the best

they can do in this mall.

DELLA

A latte's fine. Let's meet at the

fountain opposite Victoria's

Secret.

CASSIE (V.O.)

Sounds good.

DELLA

My battery's going. I'm a block

away. See you in five minutes.

CASSIE (V.O.)

Okay but I won't be able to wait

Lynn Monroe!

LYNN

I knew it was you, Della. I haven't

seen you since college. You left to

marry some handsome jock and we

never heard from you again.

DELLA

Something like that. Do you live

around here now?

LYNN

David and I just bought this divine

house in Pleasant Valley. Do you

know it? Great for the kids.

LYNN (CONT'D)

It's the first time I've left the

doors unlocked since I was a child

growing up in the Midwest. David's

been promoted to VP of United

Motors so it's all happening for

us. But enough of me. How are you?

Oh, we have two kids. Twins, Tammi

Why that's fantastic. Listen Della,

it's been great talking to you but

I have to go get my hair done!

We'll head off then, Huey, just

Scene 101Page 59

Tomas stops and watches Vinh.

Vinh continues to get into the music in his solemn Japanese

punk style. The juxtaposition between the hard core rap music

and the serious vibe that Vinh is sending out shows us that

this is really important music to him.

It's a theatrical tableau -

Della overhead, looking down on the clearing.

Vinh transfixed by the music.

Tomas stone silent, watching Vinh.

It plays out for a poignant moment. Like they're all part of

some spiritual rite about to be consummated.

Vinh pours some beer onto the ground at Huey's feet. A small

tear runs down his stoic face.

Then CLICK. The blaster is abruptly turned off by Chuckie who

appears out of the shadows behind it.

He stares a beat at Vinh like he can't believe what he's been

seeing.

Vinh keeps on moving like he's in a trance.

CHUCKIE

What the fuck you doing?

Vinh doesn't reply. Stares down at the ground, keeps on with

his weird dance. Chuckie moves towards him. Tomas grabs

Chuckie, tries to stop him from going for Vinh, but Chuckie

shrugs him off.

Chuckie reaches out and shakes Vinh. No response. He shakes

him again.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

I asked you what your deal is, sand

dancer?

The second shake sort of breaks Vinh out of his trance. He

shivers.

VINH

It's a tribute. A gesture.

CHUCKIE

A what?

Scene 101Page 60

Vinh stares down at the dirt at his feet.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Your brain even smaller than 'em

slits for eyes?

Vinh slouches defiantly over to the blaster and presses track

8 replay.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Keep on banging out that ghetto ass

shit and you'll alert every cop in

Podunk county.

VINH

It's for Huey. Our dead homie.

The song starts again. Chuckie looks at him incredulously,

shouts above the music.

CHUCKIE

You checked out, right?

VINH

He loved that track.

Vinh snorts back a sob. He hugs himself into a hunch and

starts dancing again.

Chuckie loses it. He slaps Vinh.

CHUCKIE

Get a grip, skippy.

Vinh rubs his face. He's getting a grip all right. Chuckie

slams off the blaster.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Huey's DEAD. And ain't no requiem

gonna resurrect his ass. He down

under the ground now with the real

men of respect.

The three boys stand somberly in silence, each paying

internal homage to their dead friend. Chuckie hardens his

heart against the tears that threaten to flow. Tomas

trembles, mumbles.

TOMAS

I didn't mean it. I didn't do it. I

didn't mean to kill him.

Scene 101Page 61

This breaks the moment. Chuckie snaps back.

CHUCKIE

Well he dead. That's it for him.

OVER. But we still here. Hell,

yeah. Payback's gonna be a real

bitch for a real bitch.

Vinh wipes away his tears.

VINH

She probably gone by now.

CHUCKIE

You best hope not, genius. She

gone, we gone.

Chuckie paces around the circumference of the clearing.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

DELLA!

102                                                              102

EXT. LEDGE - EVENING

Della's been watching the scene unfold, a captive audience,

attentive and terrified.

Slowly she tears her eyes away from the boys. She backs away

from the edge and right into the sharp branch of a big old

tree. The branch digs into that point in her shoulder she

hurt earlier on the barbed wire.

She reaches up to feel it and pulls her hand away bloody. She

reaches into her coat pockets for a tissue. Nothing. Feels

something in her pants pocket.

She pulls out not a tissue but a sheet of folded paper.

She unfolds it. It's Tammi's drawing. The one from the

beginning.

The stick figure family holding hands and "Mommy - We love

you" written in stars.

Della's lost in the drawing. Her eyes drink in every mark and

color and word. She sees that the male figure is slightly

separate. That the children stick figures have frightened

eyes and cling to the female. That the sky is turbulent. The

stars clear and bright. The words...

A tear escapes from underneath her eyelid. Then another. A

sob.

Scene 102Page 62

She might never see her kids again.

Another sob. She heaves with the release of emotion.

More tears escape. Another sob. She tries to bite it back.

Wills herself to stop.

Finds that rage takes sorrow's place. Rage and self

recrimination.

Goddamit! She's gonna be raped and killed because of some

stupid note! And God knows what will become of the kids.

Kenneth always told her she had a temper. That she reacts

without thinking of the consequences. This time the bastard

was right.

She looks again at the picture.

Chuckie's voice booms out into the night.

CHUCKIE (O.S.)

D-E-L-L-A, H-O-N-E-Y.

She folds the picture up carefully and puts it back in her

pocket.

Della edges further into the trees and disappears into the

darkness.

There's rustling in the darkness. Tomas pushes through the

edge of the trees, making animal calls with his right hand

curled around his mouth. The flashlight illuminates him from

behind.

Chuckie follows him operating the light in a mockery of

classic noir style. Vinh slouches behind them.

Tomas heads along the ledge, straight past the spot where

Della stood only moments before. Tomas doubles back.

Thomas stops, sniffs.

TOMAS

I can smell her Bulgari.

Chuckie's behind him surveying the area with the flashlight.

He finds several footprints by the tree.

CHUCKIE

She was right here. Must a saw your

dumb ass tribute and everything.

Scene 102Page 63

Vinh glares at Chuckie. Chuckie grins at Tomas.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Bulgari? She looks more like she

rocks that number five shit.

TOMAS

It Bulgari, dude. My Dad's bitch

bathes in it.

Chuckie points the flashlight towards where the ledge ends

and a steep incline begins.

103                                                               103

EXT. STEEP INCLINE - EVENING

The flashlight illuminates a set of prints descending down

the incline.

CHUCKIE

There more of her footprints.

Tomas and Vinh just stand like zombies.

Chuckie pushes Vinh.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

What you waiting on? Jackie Chan?

Vinh plods clumsily down the incline, followed by Tomas.

Chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch looking for a

sign of Della.

Chuckie shifts his focus to climb down the steep slope. As

the light sweeps back across the gulch we catch a glimpse of

Della between some rocks at the far side. But the boys' eyes

are elsewhere, focused on the steep incline ahead of them.

Della quickly ducks, draws her toolbox in tight and crouches

low between the rocks. She watches the boys carefully as they

climb down the gulch.

There's the sound of a stumble followed by a splash.

VINH (O.S.)

SHIT!

TOMAS (O.S.)

What now, cabron?

VINH (O.S.)

Fell in a frozen ass stream.

Scene 103Page 64

Chuckie sweeps the flashlight towards them. Della sees Vinh

trudging out of the stream, Tomas descending the last few

feet of the other side of the gulch and Chuckie midway up.

Vinh jumps up and down trying to kick the water out of his

sneakers.

CHUCKIE

Zipperhead!

VINH

Kon'aro Kusotare.

CHUCKIE

You know we don't speak the Chinky.

VINH

What's your game, Chuckie? We left

stumbling around in the dark while

you hog the flashlight.

CHUCKIE

I stole it. I get to use it. That's

how it works. That right Tomas?

TOMAS

Right on, dog.

Chuckie jumps down from the last rock and joins Vinh and

Tomas at the edge of the stream.

VINH

What if I steal it from you?

CHUCKIE

There you go, bro.

He hands the flashlight over to Vinh. Vinh reaches for it.

Chuckie pulls it away.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

April Fool. Naw, wait a minute, it

ain't April. Must be Christmas

fool.

Tomas smirks. Vinh hangs his head down. They search for more

prints, can't find any in the immediate area. Chuckie shines

the flashlight at the foot of a big rock.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Her footprints disappear at the big

rock.

Scene 103Page 65

A beat. Della clutches the lug wrench in her right hand.

Vinh shivers violently.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Head on up and search the slope.

I'll guide your way with the

flashlight.

Chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch. Della ducks.

Della needs to get out of there and fast.

They begin to ascend the rocks. Chuckie keeps the flashlight

slightly ahead of them.

Della crawls stealthily between and behind the rocks, keeping

as low as she can. Dodging the approaching light.

The boys crawl across and up and between the rocks with the

dexterity of animals. Della's so low she's scraping her knees

and hands to shreds.

She can see ahead where the rocks end and the trees begin.

What was she thinking hiding here? It was too exposed.

TOMAS

We gonna put yo ass on ice, bitch!

God please help her make it back into the cover of the trees.

Della almost vomits.

Her hand grasps the last rock at the top of the gulch. She

pushes the toolbox up on the ledge. Her strength is ebbing

but she tries to hoist herself up. The flashlight sweeps by.

She lets go of the ledge and ducks. The flashlight sweeps by

again.

She huddles in behind a rock. Waits a beat.

TOMAS (CONT'D)

You going home in a casket tonight.

Oh shit, they're approaching fast. She tries again to hoist

herself up. She's almost up when the flashlight sweeps by

again.

This time, it catches her.

CHUCKIE

THERE SHE IS, TOP OF THE GULCH!

Scene 103Page 66

She practically throws herself over the ledge. Tomas scurries

to the top faster than lightening, catches her leg as she

crawls from the edge.

THUD. She kicks him in the face.

Della grabs the toolbox. Makes a run for it.

TOMAS

AHHHHHEEEEEEHHHHH!

Tomas falls back from the gulch-side, loosening several

rocks. The rocks tumble downhill, hit Vinh.

VINH

AHHHHHHH!

Chuckie scales the gulch behind them. Vinh rubs his head.

Sees something between the trees. Thinks it's Huey.

VINH (CONT'D)

Huey?

He starts towards the brush.

VINH (CONT'D)

Is that you, homie?

Chuckie catches up with Vinh, breathless from climbing fast.

Vinh points into the brush.

VINH (CONT'D)

I saw Huey, there in the brush.

CHUCKIE

What?

Chuckie looks around, hoping against hope that Vinh may be

right, that Huey may just be alive. Vinh becomes perplexed.

VINH

I saw him.

CHUCKIE

Sure you did, bro.

Chuckie puts his arm around Vinh and helps him up the rock

side. Vinh is shivering so hard he's almost sobbing.

Just ahead Tomas pulls himself up and over the ledge.

Scene 104Page 67

104                                                              104

EXT.   WOODS - EVENING

Tomas catches up with Della, chases her into the trees.

Behind him Vinh hoists himself up over the ledge, then

Chuckie.

Della runs. Faster than she's ever run before. Practically

flies through the trees.

Her breath comes hard. His too, just behind her. Their

footfalls crash into the foliage.

It's dark, so dark. She's running blindly.

And they're right behind her. Tomas swipes at her. He just

misses. He swipes again.

A twisted shape looms ahead, almost blocks her path.

She runs right up to it then darts left at the last moment,

setting up Thomas who's right behind her.

Tomas runs into the stump of a big old tree trunk, hits

himself at groin level. He doubles over in pain.

TOMAS

CONEJO! AIN'T NUTHIN' CAN SAVE YO

ASS NOW.

Della races on.

Thomas gathers himself together, picks up the chase.

But that moment's delay has bought her some time.

Her adrenaline pumps hard. Eyes darting for a hiding place

among the dark shapes and planes of the woods.

105                                                              105

EXT. DEADWOOD PILE - EVENING

There it is, a deadwood pile.

She throws herself down into its midst. The dried branches

jag and tear at her hands and face. She burrows down low, so

low she's right in the dirt. She peers between the branches.

Tomas's feet run by and disappear. She hears him circle the

area then turn back towards her.

A moment passes. She picks the next. Rises slowly and softly

from between the jagged branches clutching the lug wrench.

Scene 105Page 68

And then there he is. Diving out of the trees towards her.

Della raises the lug wrench.

In the clouded moonlight it's an almost biblical image: a

woman rising from the brush wielding an iron black cross.

Tomas crashes towards her.

Della swings the lug wrench, hard, intensely, directly at

Tomas's face.

There is a THUD as the sharp arm of the lug wrench catches

him up under the chin. It sends him reeling.

He goes down face first.

Della gasps in horror, watches as:

Tomas pulls himself up onto his feet, comes towards her once

more.

Della swings the lug wrench back and strikes him across the

head.

He spins, clutches at his head, then reaches towards her

AGAIN.

She loses it. She swings the lug wrench towards him.    All the

years of pent up rage finally find their release.

The wrench catches up under his nose with a sickening CRUNCH.

It drives the cartilage up and into his face.

Blood spurts from the wound. He staggers backwards.

A shocked scream escapes from Della's mouth.

DELLA

Awwwrgh!

As she staggers backwards in the opposite direction.

Tomas tries to cry out but can only utter in pain.

TOMAS

Unnh! Unnh! Unnh!

He tries to pull the lug wrench out of his face. Spins.

Stumbles.

The flashlight beam travels past them.

Scene 105Page 69

TOMAS (CONT'D)

Unnh!

Tomas crashes back into a tree. He loses consciousness. His

body slumps slowly down the tree trunk to the dirt. Blood

gushes from where the wrench meets his face. He looks like

he's dressed for Halloween.

Della just stares. Stares at Tomas, at what she did, what she

had to do.

Tomas' eyes are wide open, staring too, at nothing, dead.

The horror of having killed someone overwhelms Della. She

starts shaking with shock.

Vinh cries out for Tomas

VINH (O.S.)

TOMAS!

The sound of footfalls crashing through the brush follows.

CHUCKIE (O.S.)

Curb the squealing. You a gangsta

or a boy scout?

Vinhs voice is breathless and jittery.

VINH (O.S.)

Tomas's gone, Chuckie. I can feel

it.

Della tears herself away from Tomas's body and staggers into

the deadwood to collect the toolbox. It glints, even in the

darkness.

She grabs it and runs for cover behind a tree.

Behind her in the near distance the chaotic sweeps of the

flashlight illuminates Vinh and Chuckie as they march through

the woods searching for Tomas.

CHUCKIE

Tomas is one hard son of a bitch.

He got her strung up from a tree by

now and you know it.

But Chuckie doesn't look so sure. Vinh charges ahead into the

darkness.

Scene 105Page 70

Della flashes briefly into shot, running between the trees.

The flashlight sweeps by.

VINH

There's something over here.

Chuckie walks towards Vinh. Vinh takes the flashlight from

Chuckie and shines it towards a thick shape between three

trees.

VINH (CONT'D)

It looks like a body.

They close in on a muddle of shapes, bush and spidery tree

trunks. The flashlight illuminates a tree trunk long and

thick as a body.

CHUCKIE

It's a big old tree trunk, you

paranoid gook.

Chuckie tries to take the flashlight back from Vinh but Vinh

won't give it. Chuckie doesn't persist. Vinh keeps going,

shivering and blustering.

Vinh senses something. He shines the flashlight behind the

tree trunk. Still nothing. Sweeps back.

Della darts between the evergreens behind them. She conceals

herself in between the trunks and branches. Braces herself,

waits for the right moments, the ones when they're not

looking, to run between the trees. Cognizant enough to know

they just want to find Tomas right now. She seems to be on

autopilot, becoming numb as the minutes stretch on.

She watches Vinh plod forward and through the brush. He hits

every inch of it with the flashlight. Sighs. Doubles back to

follow Chuckie.

Then, the flashlight catches a glimpse of something. Sweeps

back, illuminates Tomas's dead body, splayed out on the mud

at the foot of the tree, eyes staring wide, bloody, ghastly.

Tomas's Catholic cross pendant glimmers in the flashlight.

Silence until Vinh falls to his knees in front of Tomas,

tries to speak but only a whisper comes out.

VINH

Tomas.....IYAH!

Scene 105Page 71

Chuckie realizes from Vinh's demeanor that something really

is wrong. He hesitates a moment, then rushes over to Vinh,

stares too at Tomas's body, gulps back the desire to scream.

He punches his fist hard into the tree behind Tomas' body

instead. A shower of pine needles rains down on them.

Chuckie grabs the flashlight and sweeps it away from the

body, grabs Vinh's arm, grounding him.

Vinh sobs and shakes.

VINH (CONT'D)

She gonna kill you and me next.

We're all gonna die here. God knows

what other tools she got in that

box.

CHUCKIE

It was a stupid ass accident killed

Huey. You know that. And Tomas....

Chuckie chokes up despite himself.

He stands up, brushes the pine needles off his tee shirt.

He paces back and forth.

He pulls the gun out from deep in his jeans.

Della creeps between the trees behind them. She appears for a

second or two, like a ghost, behind the next tree.

Chuckie defiantly fights back tears.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

I promise you this.

He kisses the gun.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

This baby's gonna cancel her

Christmas.

Della darts between the trees, faster now. Their voices

follow her.

VINH (O.S.)

Ain't no gun can kill a ghost gone

bad.

Scene 105Page 72

She staggers deeper and deeper into the forest, into the

darkness.

CHUCKIE (O.S.)

You in America now, dude, where the

ghosts bleed.

She hears a faint gurgle.

She slows, listens. It's the burble of a stream..

She listens hard. Traces the sound. Treads towards it.

There it is. Glistening, even in the dark.

106                                                               106

EXT.   STREAM THROUGH WOODS - EVENING

She steps between rocks, walks straight into the stream

below.

She stands ankle deep in the icy water with her eyes closed

clutching the toolbox.

The water gurgles faintly below her, so cold it almost sounds

like glass breaking.

The ghastly images of what just happened play out behind her

eyes like an inerasable movie of the psyche to be remembered

for all time.

She's talking to herself in a whisper.

DELLA

I'm sorry.

All she knows is that she just killed a boy. It may have been

in self defense but she killed him.

DELLA (CONT'D)

I'm so sorry!

The grief overcomes her silently. Her face crumples. Her

stomach muscles spasm and wrack through her body. A grief so

deep tears would be a relief.

DELLA (CONT'D)

Where are you, God?

She falls to her knees in the stream. Holding herself and

rocking. The freezing water seeps up into her clothes, her

hair.

Scene 106Page 73

DELLA (CONT'D)

Please, I just want to see my

babies again.

Her rocking slows until it stops. There's a loud crunch close

by. She rises reflexively from the stream. Raises the

toolbox. She looks around. A branch has broken from a tree

and drags down into the stream behind her.

This seems to bring her back to herself. She realizes it's

only a matter of time before they come looking for her. She

needs to get moving.

She sets off downstream. She trudges through the shallow

water. Her wet coat drags heavily.

The stream must end somewhere, likely at the other edge of

the woods.

She trudges onwards, sweeping aside the branches of stooping

trees, stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream.

Forging ahead.

She now needs to pee. GREAT. Her temper surges up.

She looks for the right place to do it, realizes it's

probably best to pee in the stream, so all trace of it will

be dispersed.

A leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the

stream. She makes her way toward it.

She lays the toolbox down and disappears between the

branches. We see glimpses of her lifting her coat, pulling

down her pants, pushing the crotch of her underpants to the

side. We hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water

meeting the stream.

More glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants,

smoothing down her coat.

She hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up

the toolbox.

She plows down stream once more. Longing to see the light

that will tell her she's at the edge of the woods, closer to

the mall lights, closer to home.

She swallows another wave of grief.

Scene 106Page 74

The stream loops around ahead then splits into two. She

follows it, picks the left fork.

And then she hears it, the terrible sound of feet thundering

down into the stream behind her.

She doesn't even turn to see them. Just runs. Runs for her

life.

The glare of the flashlight blasts against her back. Freezing

water splashes up her legs, soaking through her pants. Her

feet slip and slide over wet rocks. But she keeps running.

Vinh's behind her. She can feel his breath, the swipe of his

hands as he grabs for her and misses. She runs even faster.

She leaps over tree trunks that cross the stream. They leap

behind her.

She pushes through the hanging branches of several trees.

Pushes them forward hard then lets them go as she passes,

right into Vinh's face.

He tries to duck but they hit him right in the eyes. He cries

out, covers his eyes.

VINH

Aaaarrhh.

This buys her a moment or two to get ahead. The stream bends

right ahead. She opts to stay in it. Chuckie leaps out, runs

along the banks, hoping to outrun and trap her.

But the stream then bends left, giving her an advantage. He

leaps back across the stream to the other side. But she's

outrunning him. He charges back into the stream behind her.

Della keeps on running through the stream, somehow trusting

its direction.

Vinh catches up with Chuckie. The boys are maybe twenty-five

feet behind her.

A SHOT rings out. Then a bullet races past her ear. Lodges in

a tree just ahead of her. She almost loses her footing. She'd

forgotten for just a moment, that they had a gun.

Another shot blasts off into the night, skims her shoulder,

hits the muddy bank of the stream. She flinches, braces

herself, keeps going, adrenalin pumping harder than ever.

Scene 106Page 75

The stream winds around a bunch of rocks ahead. For just a

moment she's invisible to them. She uses it. When she reaches

the rocks, she dives out, ducking below the glare of

Chuckie's flashlight, down behind the rocks.

107                                                               107

EXT.   EMBANKMENT - EVENING

She creeps up the muddy embankment hiding deep in the shadows

of some wiry shrubs, as close to the mud as her back will

allow.

The boys stop by the rocks. Chuckie sweeps the flashlight up

the muddy embankment, looking for a footprint, a sign of her.

She tries to creep through the midst of the brush to avoid

leaving prints. Tries to stay quiet as a mouse. Stops when

she sees the flashlight sweep by.

If she can get to the top, she can make another run for it.

All of a sudden, it grows dark. The boys must have switched

the flashlight off or maybe the battery's dead. She listens

hard for their footfalls. Nothing.

108                                                               108

EXT. PINE TREE - EVENING

She sees that she is in the shadows of a big old Pine tree.

She creeps behind its massive gnarled trunk and silently

slides open the toolbox, fumbles around for the screwdriver.

She removes it from the box and grasps it tight.

Della rises slowly, remaining concealed behind the tree. She

reaches up and softly places the toolbox deep in the junction

of the first sturdy branch and the tree trunk. She pulls

herself up onto the branch and edges in close to the trunk.

She peeks between the branches.

No sign of the boys. She pulls herself further up into the

tree, branch by branch.

The thin stiff outer branches, fringed with sharp little

needles, fall like a jagged veil around her.

She waits.

She's high enough up to have a clear view of the landscape

below despite the darkness.

She makes out the faint echo of voices, strains to hear.

Scene 109Page 76

109                                                                109

EXT. STREAM THROUGH WOODS - EVENING

Vinh and Chuckie are arguing in whispers. Vinh's pale and

shivering hard.

VINH

I don't feel good, Chuckie. You

think I got the hypothermia?

CHUCKIE

Nah, yo got the yellow fever.

Vinh sulks.

VINH

I'm telling you, it ain't natural

how she gets away every time.

Chuckie clicks the flashlight back on. Sweeps it up, across

and back down the embankment to the stream, illuminating the

banks.

CHUCKIE

She got to be hiding up on the

slope? You head up first and I'll

follow with the flashlight.

The light sweeps past her. Della shrinks further into the

branches of the tree. She crunches her foot against a branch.

SHIT!

The boys freeze, then resume talking in whispers.

VINH

I ain't going up there without the

gun. End of story.

CHUCKIE

Never would've pegged you as a

pussy, Vinh. Even when Huey and

Tomas called it, I always defended

your ass.

VINH

Ain't no one never said I was a

pussy.

CHUCKIE

She a skinny ass bitch, too. Can't

be weighing in at more than one

twenty.

Scene 109Page 77

VINH

Tomas an Huey never called me a

pussy.

CHUCKIE

I ain't speaking ill o' the dead.

VINH

You already did.

Vinh's shivering so hard his teeth are knocking.

CHUCKIE

Anyways, when you ever shot a gun?

Probably miss and shoot yourself in

the foot.

Vinh paces, braces himself to head up after Della.

110                                                               110

EXT. EMBANKMENT - EVENING

Vinh starts to ascend the embankment.

CHUCKIE

That's the spirit gangsta. Holler

if you see her and I'll shoot.

Vinh glares back at Chuckie.

VINH

Faito!

Della watches Vinh plough through the brush.

The flashlight sweeps and darts with his movements, up ahead

of him, up the embankment.

Vinh pushes through several trees, slips, regains his

footing. He plods past the tree. She slips the screwdriver up

her sleeve. Prays he won't stop.

She pulls herself further up the tree.

A sudden commotion of swaying branches startles her, followed

by a shower of pine needles.

Her heart stops.

A moment later the sound of fluttering wings is followed by

the squawking of angry birds.

She's disturbed a bird's nest.

Scene 110Page 78

She sees the silhouette of four large crows as they burst

through the branches above and up into the patch of sky

between.

The crows circle the patch of sky above, like a Greek chorus.

She looks back down for a sign of Vingh. Sees nothing. Inches

along a branch to see better.

The light sweeps back and up through the trees into her eye

line, disorienting her.

She hears footfalls so close by they must be under the tree.

Her eyes have barely readjusted when she sees him: Vinh

standing under the tree scanning the area for a sign of her.

She stares down at him, frozen, holding her breath.

The flashlight illuminates the whole tree, then sweeps away

up the embankment.

But Vinh's seen something. He makes out her footprints under

the tree. He leans down to check, then rises, looks up

through the branches.

Their eyes meet. He opens his mouth to shout for Chuckie.

She LEAPS down through the branches. Lands THUD on his back.

VINH (CONT'D)

CHUUUCCKKKKIEEE!

She silences his yell with a choke hold. Wraps her legs

around his torso. He bites her arm but she holds tight.

CHUCKIE (O.S.)

Vinh?

Panic has crept into Chuckie's voice.

CHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

VINH?

Vinh topples to the mud, dragging Della with him.

They roll as he desperately tries to disengage her.

The flashlight frantically searches the area for them.

Della frees the screwdriver she'd stuffed up her sleeve.

She DRIVES the screw driver up into the base of Vinh's skull.

Scene 110Page 79

Vinh screams.

She thrusts and twists the tool.

All the while she's tightly wound around him, intertwined,

intimate as a lover.

She drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her

knuckles dig into his stiff hair.

Vinh's scream becomes a high keening wail.

The screwdriver pierces the base of Vinh's skull. It

protrudes through his mouth, knocking several teeth out in a

stream of blood.

His scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins.

They roll downstream.

His arms are wrapped in a death grip around her.

They roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds

of the way down.

She feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers. He

becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies

right there on top of her.

She's trapped, suffocating underneath him, until she finds

the strength to push him off.

She crawls out from under his body.

Pushing him away, sets him off rolling again.

She tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady. Her head

hurts so bad it's about to burst.

The world around her shifts into a migraine zone. Trails

follow trees, rocks, brush. The desire to close her eyes, to

close it all out almost overwhelms her.

Her shoulder aches too and there's a new pain in her arm

where Vinh bit her. She sees blood has matted her sleeve, and

rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark.

There's a loud crash. Della freezes and moves only her eyes,

looks around.

It's Vinh's body hitting the stream below.

Scene 110Page 80

Where was the light at the edge of the woods? Nowhere to be

seen now that's for sure.

She staggers along the slope, clutching onto tree trunks and

roots as she goes.

Della grabs for a shrub to help her cross a patch of muddy

slope. Pulls it clean out by the roots. Loses her footing,

reaches for the roots of an old tree. She pulls herself up.

Plods once more along the slope, heading upwards in a

diagonal through the darkness.

She arrives at the top of the slope only to be met by more

darkness. But there's a strange calm about her now. Like

she's reached the eye of a terrible storm.

CHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Della?

When she hears his voice drifting faintly towards her, she

almost smiles.

She knows he's coming for her and there's nothing she can do

about it.

Della shivers as she sees a surreal tableau ahead: four huge

felled trees wrapped in white plastic. Their sad stumps are

only feet away. It's the funeral parlour of the forest.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Delllaaa?

111                                                             111

EXT.   FELLED TREES WRAPPED IN PLASTIC - EVENING

Della sinks down behind the large trunk of a plastic wrapped

tree. She listens hard, tries to fathom which direction he's

coming from.

His voice drifts in and out of proximity like he's pacing

around in circles. His voice has changed - he's dropped the

gangster schtick.

CHUCKIE

There's only you and me, now.

Maybe, if he wanders into the right position, she can sneak

up on him from behind. She rakes about in the dirt looking

for a rock or a stick. Then she remembers something, sticks

her hand in her pocket, half smiles.

Scene 111Page 81

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

I saw a little trail of your blood

back there. You must be hurt.

Della checks out the bite mark on her arm to find it's still

bleeding.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

I'm hurting too. I think you busted

up my collarbone.

His black silhouette appears ahead between the gray trees.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

I know you can hear me, Della.

Chuckie sniffs.

CHUCKIE?

I can smell your blood, your sweat.

I know you're close.

Chuckie's eyes glint in the darkness.

CHUCKIE

After what went down tonight, we

got a special bond.

Della listens, transfixed.

His dark shape beckons to her.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

May as well come out now, Della.

She doesn't move.

She watches him pace around trying to work out where she is.

He pulls out a pack of cigarettes, taps one out, lights it.

Inhales. Exhales.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

I'll save one for you, for when you

decide to come out.

He inhales again, exhales.

He laughs admiringly.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

You're one tough bitch.

Scene 111Page 82

The tone of his voice begins to change.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

And that's hot, hell yeah.

Frustration breaks through his voice. She can see his shadowy

form moving through the darkness towards her. He stops.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

And they're really cute.

Chuckie clicks on the flashlight, shines it straight ahead -

right in between the plastic wrapped trees.

Della freezes.   They?

Chuckie's eyes penetrate the darkness.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Twins huh?     Terri and Tammi.

Della doesn't move. Terrified.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

I bet you could use that cigarette

now Della honey?

(he chuckles)

A woman's purse can tell her whole

life story!

Della stares petrified as he unfolds her purse from deep in

his jacket. He empties the contents out onto the dirt.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Now I know where they are living,

I'm thinking I may stop by after

and say hello.

Della wants to run at him so bad she almost hyperventilates.

But she also knows that's what he wants and she refuses to

give him the satisfaction.

We move in closer on Chuckie. He's looking right at where

she's hiding, pure malevolence hardening his face to a mask.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

They wouldn't know a damn thing

about what happened to Mommy while

she was out, would they, Della?

Scene 111Page 83

We move in on Della. Her knuckles are blue white and her eyes

are blazing. Rage explodes in her. She doesn't even realize

that she is shouting till she's done.

DELLA

I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

Chuckie waltzes towards her hiding place.

CHUCKIE

I figured that would help you find

your voice!

Della crouches further in behind the felled trees. Why the

hell did she shout? She could have been hiding anywhere. Now

he must know for sure where she is.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Don't worry. I would never touch

them. It's wrong to hurt kids!

Right, Della?

She clamps her mouth closed. Chuckie continues waltzing

toward her, stops about twelve feet away. He stares in

between the felled trees like he has x-ray vision.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

The game's over.

Chuckie laughs.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

You won!

Sadness creeps into his voice.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

You took him from me...He was only

seventeen years old. And all he

ever wanted to do was see the

ocean. And he never saw it. No, he

never got to go.

Chuckie's grief sits like a stone in his throat.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

They're all gone now.

Chuckie coughs, a dry laboured cough. He hocks long and

deeply in his throat. But whatever it is he can't spit it

out. He rubs his throat and collarbone gingerly.

Scene 111Page 84

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

You know the movie "Clockwork

Orange"?

Della looks puzzled.   Yeah, and?

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Well, they were my droogies, Della.

Chuckie sighs.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Chances are they would of turned on

me anyway, just like in the movie.

Chuckie paces around, deep in thought.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

None of them was real ass outlaw.

No, not in the way you are.

You're the real deal, lady.

He stops.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

I was already thinking about

cutting some of em loose, getting a

new style posse together.

Della's head is spinning.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

How's about it, you and me?

This can't be real. Has he lost his mind? She utters under

her breath.

DELLA

Give me a break.

Chuckie reaches down, retrieves her diary from the dirt. She

cringes.

CHUCKIE

Monday night mechanics. Tuesday

Pilates. Wednesday Spanish.

Thursday, I wish....

He closes the diary.

Scene 111Page 85

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Face it, Della. You ain't no

suburban housewife.

Chuckie's eyes dart around in the darkness.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

So you bought into the big lie,

even tried to live it. Who could

blame you? Husband, kids, security,

every woman's dream, but not yours,

Della. You know there ain't no such

thing as security.

He coughs some more.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

But I'm betting you didn't really

know who you were until tonight. I

reckon I know what you've been

dreaming about though, what you've

been aching for, through all these

lonely, wasted years. Blasting out

of Podunk without never looking

back. Feeling the wind in your hair

and the dirt of life between your

fingers. Doing all the things they

told you you ain't supposed to do.

Taking what YOU want from life. And

wasting anyone who stands in your

way. Right, Della?

She closes her eyes like she's seeing it all behind them.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Don't say you ain't thought about

it. If it's in your blood, it's in

your blood for all time.

A longing sigh sneaks out.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

You had yourself fooled, Della.

A single tear runs down her cheek.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Shit, lady, you took my whole crew

out with nothing but a bunch of

them tools.

She opens her eyes.

Scene 111Page 86

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

You can't go back to your old life.

No way. It's all over for that.

Kaboom.

She doesn't know what to say.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

Hooking up with me's about the best

chance you got.

He sounds deadly serious, seductive even. She's lost in some

kind of trance, looking like she just might believe him.

Can she possibly be believing this?

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

I bet you're on the outs with your

old man.

She inhales sharply.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

When we pick up your kids, we can

waste him if you like.

She holds the breath in.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

I can do it. Or you can if you're

ready.

Della exhales, responds.       She seems lost to us.

DELLA

I want...

But she doesn't finish the sentence. She rises slowly from

between the plastic wrapped trees.

A momentary grimace of pain crosses her face. Then, their

eyes meet, like for the first time. It catches them both by

surprise. He smiles.

CHUCKIE

Leave the tools.

DELLA

I already did.

He shines the flashlight on her path so that she can see

where she is walking.

Scene 111Page 87

Della steps around the plastic wrapped trees and between the

stumps. She heads towards him, slowly, deliberately.

Chuckie's hands are by his sides. She stops a few feet away

from him.

She can see him up close. The clearest view of him yet. They

both look like they've been to hell.

CHUCKIE

Hell of a night, huh?

He lays the flashlight on the ground and turns the lens to

point up through the trees and into the sky between them.

DELLA

I was only going to the mall for

some Christmas wrapping paper.

Chuckie smiles.

CHUCKIE

Shit happens.

They stare at one another, all alone in the night. A knowing

moment stretches between them.

She notices the gash of matted blood and bruising on his

collarbone.

DELLA

What now?

Chuckie smiles, brings his teeth back into a scary, feral

grin.

CHUCKIE

I wanted to look you in the eye

before I kill you.

Della doesn't react.    He brings up his hand, gun clutched,

pointed and ready.

Della surprises him and us.

DELLA

That's what I figured.

She nods her head, points her chin over his shoulder.

DELLA (CONT'D)

Huey there, going to help?

Scene 111Page 88

Chuckie is puzzled.

CHUCKIE

Huey?   Huey's ....

He glances to the side for a split second, turns the gun as

he turns his head. It's enough. Della slips the flare out of

her pocket and opens it in his face.

Before he even has time to react she LEAPS at him with all

the spring left in her legs. Her fingers close around the

wrist with the gun.

The flare falls aside casting its fiery glow across them.

She crashes her good shoulder into the spongy place where his

collar bone is broken. It makes the ugly noise of sinew

tearing.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

CHRIST!

She tumbles him down to the December ground and wraps her

legs tight around him. Tight like a lover.

She grinds her chin deep and forcefully into the area of his

broken collarbone, exacerbating the wound.

He cries out, thrashes about. She keeps her body melded to

his, grinding her chin even deeper.

He wraps his arms tightly around her and pulls her even

closer, wrenches her chin up and away from his collarbone.

They roll across the dirt.   He whispers, low and close to

her.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

You're even better than I thought.

He pushes his mouth hard up against hers to stop her chin

returning to the wound. She tries to pull away but he only

presses harder.

Neither can break away.

It's unclear who's got the gun.

They roll until she suddenly pulls away, sits up.

But he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock.

Scene 111Page 89

And she has the gun.

They look at each other. He smiles.

He makes for the gun.

She fires into his chest, just once, it's enough.

His legs release. He slumps back.   Blood darkens his shirt.

Gun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound. Blood seeps

below him from the exit wound, spreading out in a dark

puddle.

His body surrenders to death.

She stares down at him. A queasy silent moment passes. She

stares at the gun in her hands. It feels so heavy, so unreal.

His dead eyes stare. She reaches over and closes them gently.

And she's light-headed, so light-headed she could just float

away. Somehow she stands up.

She looks back down at the body, not quite believing he could

be dead. She sees her silver locket lying beside him in the

pool of blood.

She retrieves it. Uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from

its exterior. Inside the photos of her kids are still there;

tiny photos of Tammis little thoughtful face and Terri's

mischievous one look back at her. She snaps the locket

closed.

She searches the area for the rest of her belongings, finds

her wallet, her purse, her diary, her lighter, her tampax

box, a lipstick in the dirt. She sticks everything in her

purse. She almost misses her pack of cigarettes. We see them

half buried under the dirt. She scans the area once more

finds them. The pack is empty but she takes it anyway.

It's time to go home.

112                                                              112

EXT. WOODS - EVENING

Without really thinking about it, Della slips the gun into

her pocket and starts running.

Tree after tree disappears behind her until she sees the

light ahead. That place where the rest of the world meets the

woods.

Scene 112Page 90

She peers through the last layer of trees like she would a

curtain to her other reality, the one she almost left behind.

The housing development is still there and not more than a

hundred feet away is her car.

She hears the sound of distant sirens.

113                                                              113

EXT. PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING

She hurries across the clearing towards her car. Sees the

trunk is open. Sees sheets of wrapping paper blowing about.

Sees the big red bow tangled around a pine.

She quickly gathers them, stuffs them in her purse.

A moment of trepidation as she reaches her car. What if it's

locked? What if the keys are gone?

She presses the Ford's driver door handle and much to her

relief, it opens. She sees the keys still dangling from the

ignition.

114                                                              114

INT. EXPLORER- EVENING

She climbs into the driver's seat and turns the key. No

connection. No surprises there!

115                                                              115

EXT. PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING

She steps back out of the car and looks nervously around like

nothing good could ever possibly happen to her again.

The hood is still ajar by a few inches, the weight of pine

branches still pressing upon it. She uses the last of her

strength to try push them away. A few smaller branches give

way but the bigger one won't budge.

She reaches under the hood for the bar and pulls hard. It

scrapes along the inner surface of the hood as she forces it

to prop the hood open to its maximum, about fifteen inches.

The hood buckles but there's enough room for her to reach in.

She fumbles about and finds the positive wire has come loose

from its attachment to the battery. She re-attaches the wire

and, Presto, the car lights up and the keys start to ping.

She almost smiles as she forces the bar back down. The hood

slams down after it.

Scene 116Page 91

116                                                               116

INT. FORD - EVENING

She quickly climbs back into the car and turns the keys. The

engine sputters but doesn't fully catch. She turns the keys

again - another wimpy sputter. Again, this time the sputter

gathers momentum, catches for a second, gives up. She tries

again, the sputter gathers momentum and catches for real.

Della looks over her shoulder and backs up, pulls out of the

tree, up and past the broken barrier and onto the road. She

makes a tight U-Turn, sticks the car into four wheel drive

and plows down the rough gravely road.

117                                                               117

EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING

She passes the Plymouth on her way. Sees its wheels lodged

deep in the mud. Keeps going.

118                                                               118

EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING

She drives right on through the ghostly housing estate,

slowing only to change back into drive as the road improves.

Empty houses flash past like a movie in rewind.

The lights of the mall grow closer.

119                                                               119

INT. FORD EXPLORER- EVENING

She passes that stop sign, sighs. The barrier is open and the

road up to the mall stretches freely ahead. She slowly inches

out on to the road and commits to her return to

"civilization".

120                                                               120

EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING

The road's empty.

121                                                               121

INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

She punches the accelerator, drives just over the speed

limit.

122                                                               122

EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING

The concrete blocks of the mall rise from the wastelands

ahead on her left.

She slows, ahead there's a small traffic jam at the entrance

to the Mall road.

Scene 123Page 92

123                                                                123

INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

She hears the siren before she sees the police car.

God, she hopes they don't notice her smashed up windscreen,

the fucked up side of the Ford.

124                                                                124

EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING

She edges slowly up to meet the line of cars. Watches as the

police car circumvents the traffic and pulls into the Mall

road, to join a police car that already has the Mall entrance

road blocked off.

125                                                                125

INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

Of course.    How long has it been? That poor security guard.

She checks the car clock. It's only 85 minutes since she left

the house! Hard to believe. Feels like another lifetime.

Another cop car whizzes past the line. How long before they

come for her? She's got to get back to the kids.

Della adjusts the rearview mirror. Her gaunt bloody face

looks back.

DELLA

Oh my.

She looks at her hands, they're ingrained with mud and blood.

And her clothes!

While waiting for the traffic to start moving again she

fumbles on the passenger seat, finds some kleenex.

She wipes her hands, her face, using the rearview mirror,

some Kleenex and the rest of the water. She looks only

slightly better.

The line starts moving. Della follows. She passes the police

cars, steals a cursory glance.

She keeps checking her face in the mirror. The cars soon

start to disperse in different directions. The Mall

disappears behind her. She turns left onto an almost empty

road.

She can't wait to see her babies, make sure they're okay. How

could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like

this.

Scene 125Page 93

She hits forty, forty-five, fifty. Takes it all the way up to

sixty. Runs a light.

126                                                                126

EXT. RAILWAY ROAD - EVENING

As long as the roads empty she's gonna own it.

127                                                                127

INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

At sixty-five she races across the railway track. She slows

down to just above speed limit when she sees a car ahead on

the adjoining road.

With one hand guiding the wheel she grabs the lipstick from

her purse.

She carefully applies it in the rearview but her mouth is so

parched it just cakes into her chapped lips. She wipes it

away.

128                                                                128

EXT. CROSSROADS - EVENING

She drives through the crossroads.

129                                                                129

INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

She applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some

color. But she just looks odd. She ends up wiping it away

with the back of her hand.

Gosh, this car in front is really taking its sweet time. She

decides to overtake. She accelerates to sixty. As she passes

the driver stares at her car.

She slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion. She

passes the familiar sign for "Pleasant Valley Drive". The

road's empty ahead so she guns it to sixty-five.

The closer she gets to home, the faster she wants to go. She

tries to resist but can't. The speedometer hits seventy.

The car hurtles into the night. Oh No, a red light ahead. And

a car waiting to go in the opposite direction. She decides to

slow for this one. Barely makes it - screeches to a halt. The

driver in the forward facing car checks her out. She attempts

to smile and look like a normal housewife.

130                                                                130

EXT. PLEASANT DRIVE - EVENING

She waits for the car to pass, then hits the accelerator

again. She signals right, turns abruptly into meet the gates

of Pleasant valley Dream Homes.

Scene 130Page 94

She rakes about in her purse for her chub card, can't find

it. She presses the intercom. No one answers. She presses

again. Still no answer. She backs out hard onto Pleasant

Valley Drive. Luckily for her, the car she overtook a few

minutes earlier pulls in. She tails the car tightly through

the gates which scrape shut against her back bumpers. But

she's in.

She guns it along Pleasant Valley Crescent and slows as she

approaches the sign for Pleasant Valley Boulevard. Checks

herself in the mirror. Pulls into the boulevard.

When she sees her house ahead a huge sob engulfs her. She

snorts it back. Not yet. Her face hurts so bad with repressed

emotion that it feels like it's made of stone.

She pulls into the driveway. Smooths her coat.

She glances at the gun, which lies on the passenger seat.

She turns off the ignition.

She looks back at the gun. She removes the car keys from the

ignition.

She glances at the gun.

She looks at the house; it all looks normal.

She takes a deep breath.

She moves to get out of the car.

She leans over, grabs the gun and sticks it in her purse. She

finds her chub card inside. She sighs.

131                                                                131

EXT. DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING

She remembers her shoulder hurts when she climbs out of the

car. That her arm hurts when she pushes the car door closed

behind her. That her heart hurts when she sees the star of

the tree still lying there in the snow.

The whole side of the car is scratched to hell and the

windshield is shattered. She makes her way down the path to

the front door. She kicks off her wrecked muddy boots on the

front step. Turns the adjoining key, on the car key chain, in

the front door lock. Pushes open the door.

132                                                                132

INT.   DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING

KENNETH

Where the hell have you been?

Scene 132Page 95

Kenneth's voice meets her as she steps into the house. Nice

welcome.

She doesn't respond. Closes the door behind her. Walks into

the house.

There he is ahead, leaning against the office door. Beer in

one hand, remote in the other. The TV blaring behind him.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

I said....

He's about to begin shouting again when he notices

something's not right about her.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

Della?

He switches the TV volume down using the remote.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

Della honey are you all right?

She stares back at him coldly.

DELLA

Please don't call me that. Don't

ever call me that again.

KENNETH

What?

She steps slowly towards him. Sees a violent adventure flick

wrapping up behind him on TV. The end credits scroll down the

screen.

DELLA

I just wanted to get home to my

babies.

Kenneth cannot understand her garbled words. He sees the

dried blood on her chin, matted mud on her coat.

KENNETH

What happened to you?

She just stares.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

Was there an accident?

Scene 132Page 96

She keeps staring, looks at him with a cold odd expression.

She needs to be held like a child but he doesn't even move

towards her. Just stands there like a jerk, unsure of what

to do, so he takes a swig of beer.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

Are you hurt?

That swig of beer turns what was left of her love for him to

stone.

Are they okay?

Without waiting for an answer.

INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING

She turns and races up the stairs.

INT. THE TWINS BEDROOM - EVENING

She opens the door softly. The night light casts a pale glow

out low across the carpet. There they are, all tucked up in

their quilts, breathing gently, little faces flushed with

sleep.

She sighs, closes her eyes with relief, softly closes the

door behind her.

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

Kenneth is pacing about the kitchen, opening another beer.

KENNETH

Sound asleep, huh?

Kenneth, unsure what to do, tries to make a joke.

KENNETH (CONT'D)

Della sighs, calmly pulls out the gun from her pocket, looks

him right in the eye, points the barrel at his face.

Scene 136Page 97

He shrinks back, silent for once, blind panic playing across

his face.

But not hers. She's cold, cold as the icy night.

She pulls the trigger at point blank range. CLICK

He recoils.

But no bullet disengages from the barrel. Nothing. She knew

there were no bullets left.

But the click echoes throughout the silent house.

DELLA

Nothing.

THE END
