BOTTLE ROCKET

screenplay by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson

DIGNAN

What color hair does he have?

ANTHONY

Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.

DIGNAN

Making Hutch David Soul?

ANTHONY

Right. The blond guy.

DIGNAN

OK. That's wrong.

ANTHONY

Dignan, it's --

DIGNAN

Plus where's Huggie Bear?

ANTHONY

He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't

in every single episode.

DIGNAN

I think you might of dreamed this

one, Anthony.

ANTHONY

No. It's a real episode. The killer

is leading him across the city by

calling different pay phones.

DIGNAN

Why?

ANTHONY

As part of his plan. I don't know

why.

DIGNAN

See, that's what I'm saying. It has

the logic of a dream.

ANTHONY

The point is the killer always

goes, May I speak to Starsky? He

says his name.

DIGNAN

(pause)

What does Starsky say?

ANTHONY

He says. This is he.

DIGNAN

This is he?

ANTHONY

No. This is he.

ANTHONY

Did you see what I meant about the

window?

DIGNAN

Kind of. Except we've already got

the keys.

ANTHONY

That's true. But what if they

change the locks?

DIGNAN

Would they do that?

ANTHONY

Who knows? That's why I filed it

down.

ANTHONY

Now that window can never be locked.

It's impossible.

DIGNAN

See, your mind is very good with

the more mechanical details.

Whereas my strength would be --

WOMAN

Can I use your Tabasco?

ANTHONY

Sure.

ANTHONY

You don't see many women who like

Tabasco.

ANTHONY

She's really kind of hot.

DIGNAN

(looks back at her, nods)

She's an attractive older woman.

BOB

Well, what do you think?

DIGNAN

I don't know, Bob. What about one

of those?

BOB

I'm not allowed to drive those.

DIGNAN

Not even for emergencies?

BOB

(a little angry)

No.

DIGNAN

I thought your parents were in Italy.

BOB

They are.

DIGNAN

So who's going to know?

BOB

My brother.

ANTHONY

Future Man.

BOB

Who?

ANTHONY

Futute Man. You know. Cause he

looks like he's from the future.

DIGNAN

He looks like he was designed by

scientists. For desert warfare.

BOB

That never would of --

DIGNAN

Let's cut the bullshit.

ANTHONY

It's got a V-8, Dignan.

DIGNAN

What do you think the cops have?

BOB

If you're that worried, maybe we

should just steal one.

DIGNAN

What are you talking about, Bob?

BOB

Can you use a coaster.

ANTHONY

Did you ever steal a car bdfore?

BOB

Yeah. I've stolen two cars before.

One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With

T-Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to

drive.

DIGNAN

You stole a Trans-Am.

BOB

Yes. I did.

DIGNAN

OK, Bob.

BOB

It's true, Dignan.

DIGNAN

Well. What do you want to do? You

want to steal one or just drive

your car?

BOB

(thinks for a minute)

I'll just drive my car.

DIGNAN

Anthony, we'll get two hundred for

the coin collection alone. That's

less than what it's appraised at.

ANTHONY

But Dignan, do you really know that

much about rare coins?

DIGNAN

I know about money, Anthony. I know

the value of money. Plus the

earrings are worth three times that.

DIGNAN

Your ball.

ANTHONY

I told you not to take the earrings.

DIGNAN

You got another ball.

DIGNAN

I'm playing your game.

ANTHONY

The list, Dignan. I know you

remember the list because you

signed it. "Things Dignan was not

supposed to touch."

DIGNAN

Every valuable item in the house

was on that list.

ANTHONY

That doesn't make any difference. I

bought those earrings for my mother

on her birthday. They have a very

special value for her.

DIGNAN

Yeah, but I can't be sorting

through that shit in the middle of

a burglary. There's just not time

for it.

ANTHONY

Then you shouldn't of gone in

there, Dignan. Maybe we should of

robbed your house. Did you ever

think of that?

ANTHONY

What?

ANTHONY

Where are you going?

DIGNAN

I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.

ANTHONY

How was I ridiculing you?

DIGNAN

You're making fun of my family. You

know there's nothing to steal from

my mom and Craig. You know exactly

what you're saying.

ANTHONY

That's not what I meant, Dignan.

DIGNAN

Did you see that?

ANTHONY

Yeah, I saw it.

DIGNAN

I'm lookout.

ANTHONY

Dignan, it's got an alarm.

DIGNAN

I don't think so. Just reach on in.

ANTHONY

That sets it off.

DIGNAN

No, just do it real quick.

(starts down the sidewalk)

I'll meet you down there.

ANTHONY

It had an alarm.

DIGNAN

Yeah, I heard that.

ANTHONY

(counting the money)

Five, seven, eight dollars.

DIGNAN

(taking the wallet)

Holy shit. What'd I tell you?

ANTHONY

Eight dollars.

DIGNAN

That's not bad.

ANTHONY

What do herbs have to do with it? I

don't understand the --

BOB

Pot is an herb. It's just like any

type of gardening.

DIGNAN

How much could you grow?

Realistically.

BOB

As much as I want. When these

plants bud I'll probably have about

six thousand dollars worth of weed.

DIGNAN

Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.

BOB

You should take a look. I have an

entire crop in my backyard.

ANTHONY

In your backyard? How do you

protect them?

BOB

It's private property. Plus I have

Hector.

ANTHONY

Hector woudn't do anything.

BOB

But he's got a loud bark. That's

the most important thing is a loud

bark.

DIGNAN

If it's that easy why doesn't

everybody grow them?

BOB

Good question.

BOB

Don't you guys tell anybody about

my plants.

DIGNAN

You're paranoid, Bob.

BOB

Yeah, but don't tell anybody.

ANTHONY

Could you grow cinnamon?

BOB

I don't know. Sure, I guess.

ANTHONY

You could make your own cinnamon

toast.

BOB

Are you a fag?

LITTLE RICHARD

You're the faggot.

BOB

Little Richard. I don't believe it.

They'll let anybody in this place.

Sit down.

BOB

Dignan and Anthony, this is Little

Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.

LITTLE RICHARD

(smiling)

I don't know about that.

BOB

Little Richard. Trust me. You're

insane. Jesus, this guy used to

carry a percussion bomb around in

his trunk. You do not want a guy

like that loose on the streets.

LITTLE RICHARD

It seemed like a good idea at the

time.

BOB

The one and only Little Richard.

DIGNAN

Are you named after THE Little

Richard?

LITTLE RICHARD

(stares at Dignan)

Ha! Ha! Ha! Why don't you stick it

up your ass. Great group of guys

you're hanging out with.

DIGNAN

What was that all about?

BOB

I can't believe you said that.

DIGNAN

What did I say?

BOB

I told you he's crazy.

ANTHONY

But he didn't say anything.

DIGNAN

Hang on a second.

DIGNAN

Little Richard. Wait a second. Hang

on. I didn't mean to --

ANTHONY

Let them fight.

BOB

Let them fight.

DIGNAN

(calling out)

Anthony.

ANTHONY

OK. Break it up. Break it up.

DIGNAN

I separated my shoulder.

ANTHONY

OK. Hang on.

DIGNAN

Just pull straight up.

ANTHONY

Is it back in?

DIGNAN

(moving arm slowly)

Yeah.

GUY #1

OK, man. Let's go.

DIGNAN

No. I'm not fighting anymore.

ANTHONY

His shoulder went out, man. It's

over.

GUY #2

You guys better get out of here.

LITTLE RICHARD

Bob?

DIGNAN

The guy is fucking insane.

BOB

I warned you, Dignan.

DIGNAN

You said it like it was a big joke,

Bob. Like he's wild.

BOB

No, I was saying crazy like a

lunatic.

DIGNAN

I know that now. He's a fucking

psycho.

BOB

Well, don't blame me. I told you.

DIGNAN

I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look

at her.

DIGNAN

Loop around real fast.

ANTHONY

Just turn right here.

CUT TO:

DIGNAN

Where'd she go?

BOB

Maybe she turned.

ANTHONY

There she is.

ANTHONY

Bob, don't be so obvious.

DIGNAN

I think we might of scared her.

BOB

Let's just go.

DIGNAN

You blew it, Bob.

TEMPLE

A gun is a firearm. A pistol is a

firearm. But anything you hold in

your hand is a weapon. A knife. A

wrench. A ballpoint pen.

ANTHONY

A ballpoiht pen?

TEMPLE

Anyone who tells you a ballpoint

pen is not a weapon needs intensive

psychiatric treatment. You can

stick them in the esophagus. You

give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.

DIGNAN

OK. Escape route. The most important

thing you can have is an escape

route. Just in case somebody's

tailing us. Or even chasing us, as

the case may be --

ANTHONY

You think we're going to be chased?

DIGNAN

That's a good question. No. I don't.

I'm just being hypocritical here.

However, I will say --

BOB

(quietly)

I'm going to take a look at this.

DIGNAN

(puts hand on gun)

Hang on This is important, Bob.

Anthony and I are responsible for

the internal situation. The money

and the people. You're responsible

for the external situation. The

streets and the getaway.

BOB

(nods)

That's my responsibility.

DIGNAN

That's your domain.

BOB

OK.

DIGNAN

Now. One thing we need to discuss

is timing. Timing is absolutely

crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!

ANTHONY

(looks up)

Nothing. Go ahead.

BOB

(to himself)

How many bullets can that hold?

DIGNAN

Bob.

BOB

I'm paying attention. I just want

to look at it for a minute.

DIGNAN

(screaming)

What's your fucking problem? You're

a shithead!

BOB

I just want to see how much bullets

it takes.

DIGNAN

Anthony, give me the fucking gun!

ANTHONY

(pulling away)

No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's

all of ours.

BOB

(quietly)

I paid for it.

DIGNAN

God DAMMIT.

DIGNAN

You two just don't give a shit, do

you?

ANTHONY

Dignan, calm down.

DIGNAN

(turns back, screaming)

You're out! I'm not working with

either one of you!

ANTHONY

Dignan! Stop!

ANTHONY

Calm down. Take a deep breath.

DIGNAN

(pause)

You're right. You're right.

FUTURE MAN

What are you guys doing?

ANTHONY

Nothing. We're just --

FUTURE MAN

You seen my brother?

DIGNAN

He's inside.

GIRLFRIEND

(smiles)

Hi.

ANTHONY & DIGNAN

Hi.

FUTURE MAN

Goddammit, Bob! Get your shit

together.

FUTURE MAN

What are you guys up to tonight?

ANTHONY

Nothing much.

DIGNAN

Just hanging around.

GIRLFRIEND

Bye.

DIGNAN

What'd Future Man want?

BOB

He doesn't get it. Held never

understand what we're trying to

accomplish here. It's too dangerous

for him.

DIGNAN

Well, in reality it's not that

dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous

if you don't know what you're doing.

BOB

Yeah, but what if some nut pulled

gun on you?

ANTHONY

The only nut with a gun is going to

be Dignan.

DIGNAN

(whispering, very serious)

You know, Bob, Anthony did kill

someone. He electrocuted our

janitor senior year.

BOB

He electrocuted someone?

DIGNAN

It was an accidental. I don't want

to go into the details. It was just

one of those senior pranks that

didn't really go right. I mean,

obviously, since Swifty's dead.

That's why Anthony never graduated.

BOB

His name was Swifty?

DIGNAN

Yeah. One of the nicest old guys

you'd ever know.

BOB

That's too bad.

DIGNAN

(nods)

You know, when somebody gets

electrocuted, their skin starts

smoking. At least Swifty's did.

BOB

What are you doing?

DIGNAN

I'm putting a piece of tape on my

nose.

DIGNAN

(immediately, dead serious)

Let's get lucky.

ANTHONY

I left my sweater inside.

ANTHONY

Do you have a lost and found?

EMPLOYEE

We're closed.

ANTHONY

I left my sweater in there.

EMPLOYEE

Oh. I see. Come on in.

EMPLOYEE

We're closed, sir.

DIGNAN

Where's that guy going?

EMPLOYEE

He left his sweater.

DIGNAN

Well, I left some money in there.

EMPLOYEE

Where?

DIGNAN

(pulls out the gun)

In the cash relister. Step away

from the door.

ANTHONY

Where's the manager?

DIGNAN

Where's the other stocker?

ANTHONY

There's another stocker, right?

DIGNAN

We know there's another stocker.

EMPLOYEE

Rob?

DIGNAN

Where is he? Where is Rob?

EMPLOYEE

I don't know. Maybe in literature.

That's his section.

DIGNAN

You got that?

ANTHONY

Sure. Literature. The classics.

ANTHONY

Is that the manager?

DIGNAN

(to manager)

Unlock that door.

(to Anthony)

Check the aisles.

ANTHONY

Rob?

ROB

(looks up, a little puzzled)

Uh-huh?

ANTHONY

Why aren't you in literature?

ROB

(hesitates)

It's all full up.

DIGNAN

Open it up.

DIGNAN

OK. Open the other. Let's go.

DIGNAN

Put it in one of those.

DIGNAN

A bigger one, you idiot.

MANAGER

(glares at Dignan)

Don't call me an idiot, you punk.

DIGNAN

I'm sorry. But that bag's too small.

CUT TO:

DIGNAN

OK, guys. Just...Sit tight.

DIGNAN

Go. Go. Drive slow.

BOB

What happened?

DIGNAN

Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.

BOB

This is natural.

DIGNAN

(looks at speedometer)

That's good. Keep it at forty.

BOB

Did we get it?

DIGNAN

Be cool, Bob. Be cool.

(quickly)

Make that light.

ANTHONY

Holy shit.

DIGNAN

We got it. We got it.

BOB

How much is there?

DIGNAN

Don't count it.

BOB

Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a

bag!

DIGNAN

No. I was calm.

ANTHONY

What about what that guy said?

DIGNAN

Oh, shit. That was scary. In the

middle of the robbery. The manager

looks at me. Right in the eye. And

goes, I'm going to remember you.

BOB

Are you serious?

ANTHONY

Yeah. He said that.

DIGNAN

I swear to God. In a very quiet

voice.

ANTHONY

Like he meant it.

DIGNAN

Yeah.

ANTHONY

Like he would find Dignan. One day.

DIGNAN

Like I'm going to hunt you down and

kill you.

BOB

You really think he'll remember you?

DIGNAN

(smiles)

No. All he'll remember is a guy

with a piece of tape on his nose.

BOB

See you.

ANTHONY

See you, Bob.

DIGNAN

Hang on, Bob.

DIGNAN

That was really good driving.

Seriously. I mean it.

DIGNAN

We'll see you later, Bob. Good

driving.

DIGNAN

What's wrong with him?

ANTHONY

What do you think?

DIGNAN

Anthony, he sat in the car and

watched a 4-11 in progress. He got

what he deserved.

ANTHONY

He was the driver, Dignan. He did

what he's supposed to do.

DIGNAN

I didn't realize you were so

sensitive to Bob's feelings.

Considering I did the plans, you're

actually lucky you got --

ANTHONY

Don't even say it, man.

DIGNAN

Bob, will you please listen?

BOB

I don't want to talk about it.

DIGNAN

Look, I admit I was wrong for not

telling you before the robbery that

your share wouldn't be as equal as

ours. But the fact remains me and

Anthony were much more exposed to

danger.

DIGNAN

I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You

didn't have some vicious lunatic

screaming, "I'm going to remember

you!"

BOB

(smiles slightly,

keeps playing)

That's true. That would give me

nightmares.

DIGNAN

Bob, I've got nightmares.

BOB

You'll probably have them the rest

of your life.

ANTHONY

What was that?

DIGNAN

What?

VOICE

Motherfucker!

ANTHONY

What's going on?

BOB

Phil. What happened?

PHIL

(hysterical)

Motherfucker. I'll kill him.

BOB

(looks around,

suddenly concerned)

Who?

PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND

I've called the police. Oh, my God,

Phil.

PHIL

Don't touch me! I swear to God I'll

get that guy.

PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND

I know you will, Phil. There was

nothing you could do. All you had

was a golf club.

ANTHONY

You're bleeding, man. Sit down.

NEIGHBOR

What happened?

PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND

Some black man beat Phil up.

PHIL

He didn't beat me up. He attacked me.

PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND

He took two hundred dollars.

ANTHONY

(to Phil)

Tilt your head back.

DIGNAN

He was probably on drugs.

OFFICER

They usually are.

PHIL

As soon as I opened the door I saw

him. A black guy. Looking through

my dad's tool box. I wanted to trap

this guy. So I closed the garage

door.

COP

And that's when he hit you?

PHIL

(looking up to sky

and concentrating)

He struck me. I fell down. He took

my wallet. Then he opened the

garage door and ran away.

COP

How'd the window break?

PHIL

I hit it with the golf club.

DIGNAN

How long do you have to go?

COP

26 weeks.

DIGNAN

And what does that cover?

COP

Social issues. Crime prevention.

DIGNAN

Hand to hand combat?

COP

Ground defense.

DIGNAN

Did you hear that?

OFFICER

What?

DIGNAN

Shhh.

BOB

What the fuck is Dignan doing with

that cop? He loves them.

ANTHONY

There's a million places to hide

around here.

BOB

Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the

guy.

ANTHONY

I hope not.

BOB

Phil probably provoked him.

(looking at Dignan)

Where's he going?

DIGNAN

No, it was a rustling sound.

BOB'S VOICE

The dog. Look out for the dog.

OFFICER

Is this dog going to bite?

DIGNAN

No. Shit no.

DIGNAN

See? I don't know what he's talking

about.

ANTHONY

Where you going?

BOB

Move.

ANTHONY

What's wrong?

DIGNAN

He probably went into the next yard.

Shine the light over here.

DIGNAN

Those are...

OFFICER

Halt! Sir!

OFFICER

Bill! He's running!

DIGNAN

The prowler! That way!

DIGNAN

Way to go, Bob!

BOB

I told you they were there.

DIGNAN

(about to explode)

So it's my fault?

ANTHONY

Be quiet.

DIGNAN

In all probability nothing would of

happened. But why take the chance?

That's why I ran. I mean how many

plants were even back there? Five?

Ten?

BOB

There were more than that.

ANTHONY

Why don't you just tell them the

truth. Those belong to my neighbor

Phil.

BOB

I don't know. I personally don't

need that shit in my life right now.

ANTHONY

Nobody does.

DIGNAN

Obviously. That's why we go on the

road. The thing about cops is they

have short attention spans.

DIGNAN

Can I get that credit card from you?

ANTHONY

(pause)

I don't like to use that credit

card, Dignan.

DIGNAN

Why not?

ANTHONY

Because my mom gets the bill.

DIGNAN

She's not going to notice, Anthony.

ANTHONY

I don't want to use it.

DIGNAN

(pause)

Well, then cut it in half.

ANTHONY

I keep it for emergencies.

DIGNAN

Anthony, we're on the run. This is

an emergency. It's only fair that...

ANTHONY

Here's mine right here. See?

DIGNAN

See if mine are in there.

ANTHONY

(looks at Dignan's shoes)

Dignan, those aren't running shoes.

DIGNAN

Yes, they are.

ANTHONY

Look at the treads on those.

DIGNAN

What about them?

ANTHONY

They obviously weren't designed for

racing.

DIGNAN

Well, those treads stink. You'd

blow a knee out racing on those.

BOB

Will you guys shut up? God. It's

like having two little kids in the

car.

ANTHONY

OK, Dad.

DIGNAN

Really. OK, Dad. But seriously,

Anthony. These are fast shoes.

ANTHONY

You've never had a pair of fast

shoes in your life, Dignan.

(to Bob)

In fifth grade Dignan used to wear

cowboy boots for P.E.

DIGNAN

That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I

wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy

me any $200 running shoes like

yours. I wasn't spoiled.

ANTHONY

Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.

DIGNAN

You were spoiled rotten.

BOB

Enough. Jesus Christ.

ANTHONY

(yelling)

You want to say it, Bob?

ANTHONY

I'll just say it.

DIGNAN

I'll say it.

ANTHONY

OK. Go ahead.

DIGNAN

On your marks...

(waits a second, says

very fast:)

Get set go.

DIGNAN

(points at Anthony)

You owe me fifty bucks.

ANTHONY

Bob?

BOB

Anthony won.

DIGNAN

Bob wasn't even looking.

GIRL

Was that shirt made from a towel?

DIGNAN

What?

GIRL

(seeing his reaction)

It's just terrycloth, isn't it?

DIGNAN

Yeah. I think so.

ANTHONY

Look, man. She didn't know anything

about shirts.

DIGNAN

No, I'm not saying her. I'm just

saying, I don't know.

ANTHONY

It's a great shirt. Don't worry

about it.

DIGNAN

Armored trucks are very difficult

to steal, Anthony.

ANTHONY

I know. But once you get inside

you're home free.

DIGNAN

Right.. Get back to me on that one.

Once your plan is worth a shit.

ANTHONY

It's not a plan. It's just --

DIGNAN

Actually. If you knew the exact

route, you could plant explosives

under a manhole cover and blow it

up as it went over.

ANTHONY

Yeah, but you wouldn't have the

truck if you blew it up.

DIGNAN

True.

DIGNAN

What the fuck is this?

DIGNAN

Ram him, Bob.

DIGNAN

Hit him!

DIGNAN

Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do

that for?

BOB

He wouldn't move.

BOB

Is he chasing us?

DIGNAN

I don't know.

ANTHONY

Speed up, Bob.

BOB

You think he got my license plates?

ANTHONY

He looked too shaken-up.

DIGNAN

I'm sure he did. We'll have to get

new plates.

BOB

It's registered in my mother's name.

DIGNAN

(shakes his head)

What the fuck possessed you?

BOB

You're the one who kept saying ram

him.

DIGNAN

I meant tap him. As a warning.

ANTHONY

Dignan, I can't get my hair cut.

That's just not possible, all right?

DIGNAN

Then you're going to have to dye

it, Anthony. We've got to hide our

identities. Especially after Bob

crashed the car.

ANTHONY

No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do

that.

DIGNAN

Even if it's the difference between

some trooper recognizing us and

throwing us in prison or not?

DIGNAN

Well, Bob, Samson has decided that

his hair is more important than our

safety.

(screaming)

My friend, that is a reckless

decision! Let's go, Bob.

DIGNAN

Bob. Are you coming?

BOB

See you in a little while.

ANTHONY

See you, Bob.

ANTHONY

No, it's OK. Come on in.

ANTHONY

It's hot out, isn't it? Yeah. This

is a nice little town. So, what, do

you do all these rooms yourself? Or

what? I'm Anthony.

ANTHONY

What's your name?

MAID

Inez.

ANTHONY

Inez?

ANTHONY

Let me give you a hand with that.

ANTHONY

How do you say nineteen?

INEZ

Dies y nueve.

ANTHONY

Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve.

How old are you?

ANTHONY

Are you ever scared of finding a

dead body in one of these rooms?

INEZ

(laughs)

No.

ANTHONY

It could happen. This is the exact

kind of place where it happens. But

I don't want to scare you.

ANTHONY

People think because they're in a

hotel they can act like a slob.

It's bad manners.

ANTHONY

Were you born in Mexico?

INEZ

Cuba.

ANTHONY

Oh, really? That's interesting. Do

you prefer Cuba or the United States?

INEZ

Scuse me.

ANTHONY

These towels are still warm.

ANTHONY

I guess from the dryer.

ANTHONY

I've never met anybody from Cuba

before.

INEZ

Housekeeping.

WOMAN

We're just checking out.

HUSBAND

Hi.

ANTHONY

Hi.

DIGNAN

You can go first, Bob.

BOB

My brother's in jail.

DIGNAN

What are you talking about?

BOB

The weed.

DIGNAN

But it's not his. How can they

arrest Future Man?

BOB

They said he's a drug dealer.

DIGNAN

Those assholes. We got rapes.

Murders. Violent crimes every

second. And this is what they come

up with.

(shaking his head)

They're just fucking him because

he's from a prominent family.

DIGNAN

I don't think they can make it

stick, Bob. I mean, what do they

actually have on Future Man?

BOB

Well, the marijuana crop is a good

start.

DIGNAN

That could be anybody's.

BOB

They also found my two beam scale

in the garage.

DIGNAN

Since when is it a crime to have a

scale in your house? Everybody has

a scale.

BOB

The cops say it's a special kind of

scale drug dealers use in selling

marijuana.

DIGNAN

So tell them the truth. What do you

use it for?

BOB

(pause)

I was just going to use it to see

how much I had.

DIGNAN

How long has he been in there?

BOB

I don't know.

DIGNAN

Then how come they haven't set the

bail yet? That's unconstitutional.

BOB

We'll have to see when we get back.

DIGNAN

What do you mean get back?

BOB

(pause)

Well, obviously, we got to go back.

DIGNAN

Bob, that makes no sense.

BOB

Dignan, he's my brother. I can't

just leave him there.

DIGNAN

This could be a trap.

BOB

Come on, Dignan.

DIGNAN

Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.

BOB

I'm going back.

DIGNAN

(louder)

Not in that car you're not.

BOB

Watch me.

DIGNAN

Good luck, since I got the keys.

BOB

Give me the keys, Dignan.

DIGNAN

I can't do that, Bob.

BOB

Dignan. You're going to give me

those keys or you're going to get

hurt.

DIGNAN

Don't threaten me, Bob.

BOB

Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If

you don't give me my keys, I swear

to God --

DIGNAN

Look, Bob. I understand your

loyalty. You're a good person. But

right now you're not using your

best judgement.

DIGNAN

Future Man would not want you to go

to jail I promise you. Just get in

the car and we'll talk about it.

DIGNAN

Future Man would never go to jail

for you, I'll tell you that.

BOB

His name's not Future Man, Dignan.

DIGNAN

I know it's not.

BOB

You don't even know his name.

DIGNAN

Yes, I do.

BOB

What is it?

DIGNAN

Just get in the car, Bob.

BOB

What's his name?

DIGNAN

OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You

know why? Because I don't care.

He's Future Man. But I care about

you. And to me it doesn't make

sense to go back to the scene of a

crime. Will you get in the car, Bob?

This is stupid.

BOB

It's not your decision and he's not

your brother, Dignan.

DIGNAN

That's right. I only have one vote.

We'll go talk with Anthony and

figure it out.

DIGNAN

You're going to ride in the back?

DIGNAN

Come on, Bob. Get in front.

DIGNAN

You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.

BOB

Let's go.

DIGNAN

Hi. How's it going.

ANTHONY

I thought you guys went to get your

hair cut.

DIGNAN

No. We didn't.

ANTHONY

We're making banana daqueris.

ANTHONY

This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.

DIGNAN

Hi.

ANTHONY

Inez, this is --

DIGNAN

Jerry.

(pointing to Bob)

And this is my associate Cornelius.

DIGNAN

May I have a word with you, please?

ANTHONY

Sure.

DIGNAN

What the fuck is going on here?

ANTHONY

What. What's the matter?

DIGNAN

Anthony, we're on the run from the

law here. Did you tell these people

your real name?

ANTHONY

No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't

speak English.

DIGNAN

They don't?

ANTHONY

No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.

DIGNAN

Which one was that?

ANTHONY

On the left.

ANTHONY

She's from Cuba.

DIGNAN

No kidding.

BOB

Dignan.

DIGNAN

(closes the door)

Anthony. Bad news.

ANTHONY

How long are they going to hold him?

BOB

I don't know. I don't know anything.

Except Phil says they got him. And

he's in jail.

DIGNAN

He needs to hire an attorney.

ANTHONY

No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here

until we find out what's going on.

BOB

Anthony, I --

ANTHONY

And if Future Man doesn't get let

out of jail in 48 hours, then we go

back. All right?

DIGNAN

Now that makes sense. We'll hang

out for a couple of days. Get a

little R&R. Make sure Future Man's

OK and then get back on the road.

ANTHONY

As long as he gets out OK.

DIGNAN

Obviously. That's a given.

ANTHONY

Bob?

BOB

What?

ANTHONY

Is that OK?

BOB

(shrugs)

Yeah. I guess so.

DIGNAN

See, now we've got a plan.

ANTHONY

Don't worry about it, Bob.

INEZ

Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?

ANTHONY

(passionate)

God, yes. Like silk.

ANTHONY

What?

(starts laughing)

What?

INEZ

Like silk?

ANTHONY

God. That does sound corny.  Oh,

your skin feels so soft and silky.

But it really kind of does.

DIGNAN

No lifeguard on duty. Swim at your

own risk.

DIGNAN

You know, I did save Anthony from

drowning once, Inez. Tell her,

Anthony.

CUT TO:

DIGNAN

See, one day we were playing hot

box over at my next door neighbor

Mr. Langston's house and Anthony

fell in the pool and got knocked

unconscious. I had to dive in and

save him.

ANTHONY

This was in fourth grade.

DIGNAN

Mr. Langston performed

cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR.

I've never said this before, but

frankly I thought Anthony was dead.

The veins in his face were all

sticking out. His skin was blue. He

truly did look dead.

ANTHONY

After that my parents never let me

go to Dignan's again.

DIGNAN

They blamed my family for everything.

They always said Mr. Langston saved

Anthony's life.

ANTHONY

But if it wasn't for Dignan I

probably would of died.

DIGNAN

(nodding, whisper voice)

Yes...It's true.

DIGNAN

Son of a bitch.

DIGNAN

He's gone. He stole the car.

ANTHONY

Where was it parked?

DIGNAN

Right here.

DIGNAN

That coward. Son of a bitch.

ANTHONY

Maybe he just went to the store.

DIGNAN

He took his stuff. He's gone.

(pause)

I should of seen this. I should of

expected it. Bob doesn't have any

character.

ANTHONY

He went back for his brother.

DIGNAN

We said 48 hours.

ANTHONY

That's a long time to be in jail.

DIGNAN

We'll get him. Don't worry about

that. We'll go back. We'll find him.

And we'll blow up his car. Or do

something. I promise you.

DIGNAN

I mean, let's face it. Bob was dead

weight. We're a lot better off

without him.

(pause)

But who could expect it? Just like

that. Steals the fucking car. What

kind of person pulls that --

ANTHONY

Bob didn't steal the car. He told

me he was going. He had to go help

his brother.

DIGNAN

When'd he tell you?

ANTHONY

This morning.

DIGNAN

Where was I?

ANTHONY

You were asleep.

DIGNAN

He told you and you let him do it.

ANTHONY

He told me because he wanted to

know if I wanted to go.

DIGNAN

(hesitates)

If you wanted to go? What were you

going to do? Just leave me here by

myself?

ANTHONY

Well, I didn't do it, did I?

DIGNAN

So when you were saying Bob's at

the store and acting real suprised,

that was just an act. You were

just --

ANTHONY

Bob went to help his brother. I

understand that and I can't help it

if you don't.

DIGNAN

I understand that if I had a few

more friends like you and Bob I'd

be dead.

ANTHONY

If you say so.

DIGNAN

If you'd gone with Bob you'd

probably be in Weatherford by now.

Of course I'd be here frantically

worrying thinking you must of got

kidnapped.

ANTHONY

I didn't realize you had such an

incredible ability to feel sorry

for yourself, Dignan.

DIGNAN

Well, the world is a little bit

colder today.

ANTHONY

You want to look at the map?

ANTHONY

See. Here's where we are.

DIGNAN

I didn't know he had it in him.

(pause)

I guess you could say the child has

become the father of the man.

ANTHONY

We're going over to this bar if you

feel like going.

DIGNAN

No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you

later.

ANTHONY

Why don't you come with us.

DIGNAN

OK.

MAN

Hello, my friend. You in the Army,

yes?

DIGNAN

No. I just have short hair.

MAN

Is that your chiquita?

DIGNAN

No, my friend knows her.

MAN

She Chicano, yes?

MAN

You like Chicanos?

DIGNAN

Sure.

MAN

Play pool? For one cerveza.

MAN

(smiling)

You a good pool player.

DIGNAN

Got a little lucky.

MAN

Where's your friend? He go with the

chiquita?

DIGNAN

I don't know.

MAN

She is a good looking woman.

DIGNAN

Guess I'll get another Tecate.

MAN

Si. Tecate. You like to fight?

DIGNAN

What?

MAN

Fight. You know.

DIGNAN

No. Just pool.

MAN

You Hoto?

DIGNAN

(pulls away)

Fuck you. You a Hoto.

MAN

(smiles)

No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?

DIGNAN

Right.

MAN

Pinche cabrone. Puta madre.

ANTHONY

I can't believe he just jumped you.

DIGNAN

Can you hand me those french fries.

ANTHONY

I wish I'd been there.

DIGNAN

Would of been nice.

ANTHONY

Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a

walk --

DIGNAN

I don't really feel like talking

about it. The only thing I feel

like is getting the fuck out of

this place.

ANTHONY

(pause)

We need a car.

DIGNAN

I have an idea for that.

ANTHONY

What?

DIGNAN

Inez has a master key to all these

rooms, doesn't she?

(pause)

Doesn't she?

ANTHONY

I don't think we can do that.

DIGNAN

I know we can. It's real simple. We

go into a room, grab some car keys

and --

ANTHONY

What I'm saying is she wouldn't go

for that.

DIGNAN

She doesn't need to know.

ANTHONY

(pause)

I don't know, Dignan. I just --

DIGNAN

Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out

of here. It's real torture for me

to be here. Getting the shit kicked

out of me by Mexicans.

ANTHONY

Shh.

DIGNAN

No one to back me up. Now I have a

good idea. So unless you come up

with something better --

ANTHONY

Dignan. I can't do that. All right?

I just can't.

DIGNAN

Then you better think of something.

INEZ

How are you, Jerry?

DIGNAN

(staring at TV)

I feel great, Inez.

ANTHONY

(kisses her)

I'll see you later.

ANTHONY

I don't think we need any keys,

Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car

for us.

DIGNAN

You don't know how to hotwire.

ANTHONY

Yes, I do. Bob taught me.

DIGNAN

Bob taught you how to get

electrocuted.

ANTHONY

No, I'm serious. He made me a

diagram.

CUT TO:

DIGNAN

What'd you say to Inez?

DIGNAN

"I'll come back for you. I love

you, Inez."

DIGNAN

"I'm going to take you away from

all this windexing and making beds."

ANTHONY

Man, I don't know anything about

cars.

DIGNAN

You really know how to pick them.

ANTHONY

I think we better go home.

DIGNAN

Don't panic, Anthony.

ANTHONY

I'm not. But there's --

DIGNAN

You can't just run home every time

things get tough. First of all,

we've got enough dough to --

ANTHONY

Our money situation is not good.

DIGNAN

(clapping him on the back)

You're so spoiled. What is "not

good" to you? Only a few hundred --

ANTHONY

We've got sixteen dollars.

DIGNAN

That's not correct.

DIGNAN

Give it to me.

DIGNAN

Sixteen dollars.

ANTHONY

I know.

DIGNAN

Where's the rest?

ANTHONY

I had to give some to Inez.

DIGNAN

How much?

ANTHONY

$383.

DIGNAN

What!

DIGNAN

You gave $383 to the goddamn

housekeeper! What the fuck is your

problem?

ANTHONY

She needed it.

DIGNAN

A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!

ANTHONY

Her name's Inez. Stop calling her

the housekeeper.

DIGNAN

That's what she is!

ANTHONY

I know that. But --

DIGNAN

You're in love with the fucking

housekeeper!

ANTHONY

Shut up!

DIGNAN

What are you going to do, get

married? Have a bunch of little

idiot janitor brats! And go around

scrubbing the --

ANTHONY

Stop!

(pause)

Now listen to me.

BLACKOUT.

ANTHONY

Bob, where you going?

BOB

I'm not playing any more golf.

ANTHONY

Why not?

BOB

Cause I'm not getting any better.

It's a waste of time.

ANTHONY

You've only been playing for two

weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to

learn this game.

BOB

You think I'm improving?

ANTHONY

(pause)

Yes. You just got to stick with it.

BOB

You don't have to talk about it if

you don't want to.

ANTHONY

No, I don't mind.

BOB

I know it must of been a bad

experience. But it doesn't sound

like it was your fault.

ANTHONY

Well, I didn't mean to electrocute

him. But the whole operation was my

idea.

ANTHONY (VO)

It took six months of research. I

did all the wiring myself. Switched

AC to DC. Doubled the voltage.

Shorted out the generator. The

whole school was shut down.

BOB (VO)

That's pretty complicated for a

senior prank.

ANTHONY (VO)

I don't like that word prank, Bob.

I was trying to do something more

than a prank.

ANTHONY (VO)

I wanted to create an event.

Something everyone would remember.

And at first it worked perfectly.

The whole school was standing

around outside. Kids running all

over the place. Everybody laughing.

ANTHONY

Even the school custodian Swifty

thought it was great. He kept

laughing and shaking his head the

whole time he tried to disconnect

the generator. And then suddenly

(snaps his finger)

total silence except for Swifty

hanging off the generator with his

leg stuck to it being electrocuted.

ANTHONY

Actually he died of a heart attack

brought on by the shock. He was an

older guy.

ANTHONY

I felt terrible. I'd known Swifty

since first grade. He was Dignan's

medicine man for Indian Guides.

They called each other Rattlesnake

and Killer Whale. Whenever Dignan

came to visit me he would act like

he and Swifty weren't that good of

friends, but that was just to make

me feel better. The whole rest of

the school had turned against me.

ANTHONY

At first they were going to charge

me with manslaughter. That's partly

why I was in custody so long. Sixty

days.

BOB

Sixty days?

ANTHONY

Yeah. One minute you're studying

Great Expectations and the next

minute you're drawing the Holy Mary

for some kid who tried to stab his

girlfriend.

BOB

Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?

ANTHONY

Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty

good. It's not like drawing on paper.

CUT TO:

ANTHONY

(pause)

It's a panther.

FUTURE MAN

How's that 700 bucks coming?

BOB

I'm working on it.

FUTURE MAN

Hard to find it sitting by the pool

drinking beer and bullshitting.

ANTHONY

I thought he didn't have to pay

anything because of the technicality.

BOB

Yeah, but he still has the

aggravation. Three days sitting in

a cell.

ANTHONY

(pause)

Were you adopted, Bob?

BOB

Why do you say that?

ANTHONY

Well, because you guys don't look

alike.

BOB

No. I wasn't adopted.

ANTHONY

Was Future Man adopted?

BOB

Jesus Christ! No.

DIGNAN

There's a lot of valuable shit in

there, Applejack. The silver and

the china. The crystal. And the

grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet

that clock's worth ten grand.

APPLEJACK

Why the fuck do we need to blow up

the car? It doesn't make any

goddamn sense.

DIGNAN

Just settling an old score. You

might say revenge.

APPLEJACK

That sounds like a lot of bullshit

that'll land us in jail.

DIGNAN

We might have to take that chance.

Cause I feel pretty strongly about

this.

APPLEJACK

Is that Buckethead?

DIGNAN

Get down.

APPLEJACK

Is that him?

DIGNAN

Wait a second.

DIGNAN

That's Anthony.

APPLEJACK

That's your friend Anthony?

DIGNAN

Yeah.

APPLEJACK

What's he doing here?

DIGNAN

Looks like he's staying with

Buckethead. That's what I figured.

He's probably got his own room.

Let's see where he's going.

DIGNAN

Don't get too close.

DIGNAN

Stop. He saw us.

DIGNAN

Wait. Did he see us?

APPLEJACK

We're going too slow. It looks like

we're following him.

DIGNAN

Speed up.

DIGNAN

Anthony!

DIGNAN

Wait up.

DIGNAN

Where you going?

ANTHONY

Just walking Hector.

ANTHONY

When'd you get back?

DIGNAN

Ah. Couple days ago.

DIGNAN

(under his breath)

You want to shake hands.

ANTHONY

Who's in the car?

DIGNAN

That's Applejack. You want to meet

him?

ANTHONY

Sure.

DIGNAN

This is Applejack.

ANTHONY

Nice to meet you, Applejack.

APPLEJACK

You're Anthony?

ANTHONY

Yeah.

APPLEJACK

I hear you're a good thief.

APPLEJACK

I'm just sitting at this bar

drinking my drink when this fine

chick walks by. She was a living

doll. And the big motherfucker who

came in with her sees me looking,

when he walks by he steps on my

foot. Doesn't say shit. Just takes

a seat with his lady. Well, I

holler out to him, If I was as big

as you, ain't no way in the hell

you'd of stepped on my foot like

that. He just laughed. He says,

Little man, take your foot and put

it in your pocket. I said, No, how

about I take my foot and I stick it

up your ass? Man, we went to war

right there. I hit him so hard I

knocked his nuts in his watchpocket.

But this motherfucker wouldn't go

down. Then all the sudden, out of

nowhere, Dignan came up behind him

and smashed a bottle on his head.

And that big old boy went down.

That's how I met Dignan. Good cat

to have on your side. He'll go to

war with you. He don't give a fuck.

DIGNAN

Applejack would of got him anyway.

This was just the quicker war.

ANTHONY

You really hit a guy with a bottle?

DIGNAN

Pretty much. He kind of fell into

me. But wait a second.

DIGNAN

I want you to look at this.

ANTHONY

What is it?

DIGNAN

It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's

called Hinckley Cold Storage.

ANTHONY

What's Hinckley Cold Storage?

DIGNAN

Mr. Henry has an inside source. We

call him Steve. That's where we get

our information.

ANTHONY

Who's Mr. Henry?

DIGNAN

You'll meet him this afternoon.

He's helping us set it up.

APPLEJACK

Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper

Trust robbery?

ANTHONY

(shakes his head)

Uh-uh.

APPLEJACK

S. Cooper Trust,in San Francisco?

ANTHONY

Uh-uh.

DIGNAN

Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965.

It's famous. Applejack was the

wheel man. Did you use this same

car, Applejack?

APPLEJACK

Hell, no. This is a '72. I was

driving a '63 Pontiac.

ANTHONY

What exactly is this place? Freezers?

DIGNAN

Right. Freezers. Imported foods.

APPLEJACK

Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.

ANTHONY

Abdul-Shabazz?

DIGNAN

Just a nickname.

ANTHONY

What time did he say to be here?

DIGNAN

Right now.

APPLEJACK

I can knock a man out with a six

inch punch.

ANTHONY

What do you mean?

APPLEJACK

Feel this.

ANTHONY

(whistles)

You could give somebody a concussion.

DIGNAN

Let me feel that.

DIGNAN

(grabbing his hand)

Ow. Shit.

MAN

How's the weather down there?

DIGNAN

(pause)

Mr. Henry?

MAN

Come on in!

DIGNAN

It's locked.

MAN

No, it's not.

MR. HENRY

Dignan. Good to see you. Good to

see you Applejack.

(looks at Anthony)

Who are you?

DIGNAN

This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.

MR. HENRY

This is no good.

MR. HENRY

This is no good, bringing him here.

What are you thinking? What the

shit, man? Are you crazy?

MR. HENRY

I'm pulling your leg. Abe Henry.

MR. HENRY

This is my business manager, Rowboat.

ANTHONY

Nice to meet you.

MR. HENRY

That's a sharp jacket.

ANTHONY

Thanks.

ANTHONY

It's hard to get much spin with

this kind of paddle.

MR. HENRY

It's called a racquet, Anthony, and

you're holding it wrong. That's

ghetto play. Hold it like this.

MR. HENRY

You know, your form is for shit,

but you've got a hell of a talent.

ANTHONY

Thanks.

ANTHONY

Nice shot.

MR. HENRY

Is he in?

DIGNAN

I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?

ANTHONY

Yeah, I'm in.

MR. HENRY

OK, kid. Let's go talk about cops

and robbers.

MR. HENRY

Every once in a while some cat

comes to me. He wants to know how I

made it. How did I become a success?

The first thing I tell them is:

follow your instincts. Let your

instincts guide you. The second

thing I tell them is, for Christ's

sake: you got to know your grammar.

ANTHONY

Grammar.

DIGNAN

What do you mean grammar?

MR. HENRY

The basic grammatical rules of

robbing.

ANTHONY

You mean like techniques?

MR. HENRY

(nods)

Technique. That's right. Seventy-

five percent of your job is crowd

control. Seventy-five percent. Do

you believe that?

DIGNAN

(pause)

Yes, I do.

MR. HENRY

On the other hand you got to have

the right equipment. I don't care

if you're Harry Houdini. You can't

pick a lock without a hairpin.

ANTHONY

I'd like to live in that place.

Hinckley Cold Storage.

MR. HENRY

Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK.

Pop quiz. What's the single most

important aspect of your job?

DIGNAN

The grammar?

MR. HENRY

Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake

up, guys.

DIGNAN

Oh, yeah.

MR. HENRY

You're going to need a boxman for

this one. But that can be arranged.

ANTHONY

You mean a safecracker?

MR. HENRY

Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're

going to want: Kumar Banijamali.

DIGNAN

Is he good?

MR. HENRY

He's damn good.

DIGNAN

So what do you think of the plan,

Mr. Kumar?

DIGNAN

We'd love to have you on the team.

ANTHONY

What is that? An orchid?

KUMAR

Good plan.

DIGNAN

What do you think?

ANTHONY

(nods)

He seems pretty good.

BOB

Hey, Dignan. How's it going?

DIGNAN

Not bad.

BOB

Come on in. What you been up to?

DIGNAN

Not a whole lot, Bob.

BOB

It's too bad about what happened on

the road.

DIGNAN

Yeah. It is.

ANTHONY

Let's not even talk about it.

BOB

It was stupid.

DIGNAN

Right. It was extremely stupid.

BOB

I don't expect an apology and I

don't even want one. I just want us

to --

DIGNAN

I can't fucking believe this guy.

An apology, Bob?

BOB

Man, I don't want to go into this.

ANTHONY

Yeah. Let's keep it --

BOB

Cause you would of let my brother

rot in jail.

DIGNAN

You said 48 hours!

BOB

I never agreed to that.

DIGNAN

Bob, you're lying!

BOB

Bullshit.

DIGNAN

All right! Backyard! Right now!

DIGNAN

Let's go, Bob!

ANTHONY

Dignan. Take it easy.

DIGNAN

Bob!

BOB

No, Dignan. This is stupid.

ANTHONY

Yeah. Dignan. Look. Let's just --

ANTHONY

Stop, Dignan!

ANTHONY

He doesn't want to fight.

DIGNAN

Get out of the way.

ANTHONY

No, Diqnan. This isn't --

DIGNAN

Come on!

BOB

I don't want to fight you, Dignan.

ANTHONY

Dignan, we're friends. Take it easy.

ANTHONY

Dignan. Dignan.

DIGNAN

All right. Stop.

DIGNAN

No fighting.

DIGNAN

No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.

ANTHONY

Easy, Dignan. It's OK.

DIGNAN

It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had

your brother.

BOB

I didn't have any choice.

DIGNAN

I'm sorry, Bob.

BOB

That's OK.

ANTHONY

(starting to laugh)

Shit, Dignan.

DIGNAN

(smiles)

What the fuck are we doing out here?

ANTHONY

I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.

DIGNAN

I'm sorry, Bob.

BOB

That's OK.

DIGNAN

Look. We want you on the job.

MR. HENRY

Let me get this straight. You don't

play golf and you don't play tennis.

So why do you belong to a country

club?

BOB

You got me.

MR. HENRY

(shakes his head)

You're a piece of work, Bob.

JACKSON

How you doing, Bob?

BOB

Hey, Jackson. How's it going?

JACKSON

You keeping out of trouble?

BOB

I'm trying.

JACKSON

(looks at others at table)

This boy's a troublemaker. He used

to tear this place apart.

JACKSON

Your brother was up here the other

day. He said you ran away from home.

BOB

He said what?

JACKSON

He said you ran away from home.

BOB

No. I didn't run away. I went out

of town.

DIGNAN

Bob.

FUTURE MAN

Fancy seeing you here, Bob.

BOB

Yeah. Hey, Clay.

CLAY

Hi, Bob.

FUTURE MAN

(smiling)

So what's shaking?

BOB

Nothing much.

FUTURE MAN

How's it going.

ANTHONY

Fine, thanks.

FUTURE MAN

John Mapplethorpe.

(shaking hands with

crew across table)

How are you. Hi.

MR. HENRY

Good to know you, John.

BOB

Jackson says you told him I ran

away from home.

FUTURE MAN

I might have mentioned it.

BOB

John, I'm twenty-six years old I

didn't run away from home.

FUTURE MAN

I know, Bob. You were on a secret

mission.

BOB

I'd appreciate it if you didn't go

around telling people lies about me.

FUTURE MAN

Right. I'm sorry.

(looks at Clay)

You've got a reputation to think

about.

MR. HENRY

The world needs dreamers, son.

FUTURE MAN

What?

MR. HENRY

The world needs dreamers. To

relieve the pain of consciousness.

FUTURE MAN

Well, we'll see you later, Bob.

MR. HENRY

Pleasure to meet you, John.

FUTURE MAN

(hesitantly)

Nice to meet you.

MR. HENRY

I hope this doesn't offend you, Bob.

(looks closely at Bob)

Your brother is a cocksucker.

BOB

No. That doesn't offend me.

DIGNAN

OK. Man in blue jeans just left by

southwest door. He is entering a

white van. What time is it?

ANTHONY

Eleven fifteen.

DIGNAN

OK. Mark that down.

ANTHONY

I did.

DIGNAN

God. Isn't this great? Working on

the job. Got a wheel man. Got a

safecracker. Good friends with Mr.

Henry.

ANTHONY

Yeah. It's pretty good.

DIGNAN

It's like we've finally arrived.

DIGNAN

What are you writing?

MR. HENRY

Look at that woman. She's what?

Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't

let herself go. I appreciate an

older woman who has a commitment to

her body.

ANTHONY

So do I.

MR. HENRY

Tell me something. What the hell

kind of name is Dignan?

ANTHONY

I'm not really sure. I think it's

Irish. Or maybe --

MR. HENRY

I guess what I'm trying to say is

what the hell kind of person is

this Dignan?

ANTHONY

What do you mean what kind of

person? He's a good person.

MR. HENRY

Sure, sure. He's a great person,

and I'd call bullshit on anybody

who said differently. But I wonder

if the kid has the goods

(taps his temple)

up here.

ANTHONY

(long pause)

I don't think you're giving him

enough credit. I know sometimes he

doesn't think an idea through. He

gets too excited. But --

MR. HENRY

As far as I can tell he hasn't

thought his life through. He'd be

fine cutting my grass or parking my

car. But business?

(looks at Anthony)

You I can work with. You I could

groom. Dignan's not going to make it.

ANTHONY

You're wrong about Dignan.

ANTHONY

And you're wrong if you think, I'd

turn my back on a friend.

MR. HENRY

Hold it.

MR. HENRY

Anthony. I want.to say one thing to

you.

MR. HENRY

Congratulations. You passed the test.

ANTHONY

What do you mean?

MR. HENRY

The Abe Henry double-cross test.

You just made a perfect score.

ANTHONY

That was a test?

MR. HENRY

Take a deep breath.

MR. HENRY

How does that feel?

ANTHONY

It feels good.

ANTHONY

Did Dignan take the test?

MR. HENRY

(pause)

Yes, he did.

ANTHONY

How'd he do?

MR. HENRY

Well, he agreed 100% that Bob

should be dropped. And he also

agreed you were a liability. But he

felt his talent would make up for

your weaknesses.

ANTHONY

That sounds like Dignan.

MR. HENRY

Woah. There he is. Applejack! What

it is.

APPLEJACK

Is my car OK out there?

MR. HENRY

I love it. He always wants to know

if the car's OK. Get a hot dog.

APPLEJACK

I don't eat pork.

MR. HENRY

Super K. Kumar. Come here.

APPLEJACK

I don't know why the fuck we're

having a party. The damn job's not

over yet.

DIGNAN

Well, this isn't really a party per

se.

APPLEJACK

You don't celebrate til it's over.

DIGNAN

True.

APPLEJACK

What the fuck are you doing?

ROWBOAT

What was that all about?

DIGNAN

Ramedan.

MR. HENRY

I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like

this I get philosophical. What does

it mean? What's it all about? Are

you afraid to die?

ANTHONY

Me?

MR. HENRY

No, that door over there.

ANTHONY

I don't want to die.

MR. HENRY

Are you afraid?

ANTHONY

Yeah. I mean, I don't think about

it all the time. But once in awhile

I kind of go, Woah. Man.

MR. HENRY

Exactly. Woah.

ANTHONY

Death.

MR. HENRY

The fear of death, The pain of

consciousness.

(taking a sip)

Did you mix this martini?

ANTHONY

No. Bob did.

MR. HENRY

Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.

(laughs uproariously)

I love palindromes.

ANTHONY

Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?

MR. HENRY

(looks right at him)

Anthony, I'm petrified.

BOB

Is that sugarless gum you're chewing?

GIRL 2

I'm not chewing gum.

BOB

Would you like a piece?

GIRL 2

(smiles brightly)

Sure. Thanks.

KUMAR

If someone could copy my life story.

If I had someone, man, to just

write what I talk. I have so many

stories. Bestseller, man.

APPLEJACK

I've been all over the Goddamn

country. I've seen things.

KUMAR

I used to go to Vegas and do

headstands.

APPLEJACK

No kidding.

KUMAR

Easy.

DIGNAN

Come on, Bob.

BOB

I know it, man. Hang on.

DIGNAN

Jesus Christ.

ANTHONY

Give him a second.

BOB

Hopscotch. The code name is

hopscotch.

DIGNAN

Good.

MR. HENRY

Join the party, fellas.

DIGNAN

We're just going over a few things.

MR. HENRY

I'll tell you something, Dignan. It

is possible to overplan. You don't

want to turn the crew into robots.

Right?

MR. HENRY

You got to have fun with it.

There's no point if you're not

having any fun. Would you like me

to be there tomorrow?

DIGNAN

Yes.

MR. HENRY

(immediately)

Why?

DIGNAN

Well, I think --

MR. HENRY

No, if I go out on this job, then

it's just another score by Mr.

Henry. And I don't see it like that.

This is your job. Your creation. I

want you to try this.

ANTHONY

This is good.

MR. HENRY

I want to ask a favor, boys. One

day, when I'm long gone and all but

forgotten, make one last toast to

Abe Henry. And remember me as a

friend.

MR. HENRY

Well, that's just it, Anthony. A

lot of criminals have problems.

Some of them are alcoholics. Some

have drug problems. Others dome

from broken homes. I see a real

need for healing.

MR. HENRY

But you're thieves. It's what you

are.

ANTHONY

Yeah.

MR. HENRY

It's an esoteric journey.

MR. HENRY

We're renegades from despair.

ANTHONY

(nods)

Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?

MR. HENRY

Absolutely.

ANTHONY

Why'd you want to help us?

MR. HENRY

(inhales, pause,

holding in smoke)

Because I was like you once. And

there was no one there to help me.

DIGNAN

Next week we'll be drinking pina

coladas.

ANTHONY

(nods)

Hopefully this trip'll go a little

smoother than the last one.

ANTHONY

Or I might end up with a broken nose.

DIGNAN

Did that hurt?

DIGNAN

This'll be a good trip.

ANTHONY

I'll try not to hold you back

tomorrow.

DIGNAN

I don't think you will.

ANTHONY

I don't want to be too much of a

liability.

DIGNAN

Look, you're going to do fine. It's

OK to be scared.

ANTHONY

(laughs slightly,

shaking his head)

I don't think I ever said this to

you. But it meant a lot to me the

way you were after that Swifty

stuff happened.

ANTHONY

He was a nice guy.

DIGNAN

(shrugs)

He was all right.

ANTHONY

Do you like Inez?

DIGNAN

As a person?

ANTHONY

Yeah. As a girl.

DIGNAN

Yes. I do.

ANTHONY

So do I.

ANTHONY

You OK, Bob?

BOB

(snaps)

No, I'm having a heart attack. Of

course, I'm OK. What's that supposed

to mean?

ANTHONY

(pause)

Nothing. I was just asking.

DIGNAN

Jesus, Bob.

BOB

No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel

fine. You want a piece of cake?

ANTHONY

(pause)

Sure.

DIGNAN

I'll take one of those, too, please.

ANTHONY

Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to

Scarecrow.

DIGNAN (VO)

Go ahead, Bird Dog.

ANTHONY

You're all clear.

DIGNAN (VO)

Roger.

ANTHONY

(pause)

We all set?

DIGNAN (VO)

Hang on a second.

DIGNAN

(into walkie talkie)

OK. Let's do it.

DIGNAN

Let's get lucky, Bird Dog.

BOB (VO)

Scarecrow?

DIGNAN

Yeah?

BOB

Everything OK?

DIGNAN (VO)

Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's

it look back there?

BOB

It looks pretty good. There's

nobody back here.

DIGNAN

Stand by. Bird Dog?

ANTHONY

Uh-huh?

DIGNAN (VO)

Take your second position.

ANTHONY

OK. Roger.

DIGNAN

OK. Six minutes.

KUMAR

Where did he go?

DIGNAN

Who? Applejack?

KUMAR

Why did he go that way?

(points back down hall)

DIGNAN

He's going to watch the back

stairwell, remember?

(pause)

Don't worry about it.

DIGNAN

(into walkie talkie)

Bird dog? You in position?

ANTHONY

I'm in position, Scarecrow.

DIGNAN (VO)

Any activity?

ANTHONY

Not at all. The place is totally

deserted.

DIGNAN (VO)

Good. It's supposed to be.

ANTHONY

I've got a great view up here. I

can see all the --

DIGNAN (VO)

Stand by, Bird Dog.

DIGNAN

Jacknife. Come in, Jacknife.

(pause)

Hello? Bob? Are you there?

DIGNAN

(beat)

Bob? What the fuck is going on?

Anthony? Who's in the elevator?

ANTHONY

I don't know.

DIGNAN (VO)

Check the fucking elevator. It's

moving.

ANTHONY

What are you doing?

BOB

My walkie talkie's busted. 1 can't

tell what's going on.

ANTHONY

Let me see it.

(fiddling with it)

Did you drop it?

BOB

No.

DIGNAN

What's happening? What's going on?

ANTHONY

It was Bob. His walkie talkie's

busted.

BOB

I couldn't hear anything.

DIGNAN

Who's watching the door? What the

fuck are you doing? Get back in

position.

DIGNAN

Who did that? What the fuck is that?

ANTHONY

It's going back down.

DIGNAN

(pannicking, into

walkie talkie)

Applejack! What's happening?

APPLEJACK (VO)

What?

DIGNAN

Bob! Get back in position!

DIGNAN

Don't move! Get up against the wall!

DIGNAN

(into walkie talkie)

They're back! Get down here!

(not into walkie talkie)

What are you doing here?

GUY IN JUMPSUIT

We work here.

DIGNAN

Time!

ANTHONY

(checks watch)

Two minutes.

APPLEJACK

Where'd they come from?

ANTHONY

The front stairs.

APPLEJACK

(to Bob)

Where were you?

BOB

My walkie talkie broke.

DIGNAN

What's the story?

KUMAR

Can't get it. It won't...

(make s gesture)

DIGNAN

What can we do?

DIGNAN

OK. Fuck it.

DIGNAN

Let's go. Fuck it.

ANTHONY

Freeze!

DIGNAN

Nobody move!

ANTHONY

Get against the wall!

ANTHONY

Jesus, Bob.

BOB

I didn't do anything.

ANTHONY

Applejack? Are you OK?

DIGNAN

(shouting)

What's wrong with Applejack?

BOB

He's having a heart attack or

something.

DIGNAN

(screaming)

Let's go!

DIGNAN

Help me move him.

ANTHONY

Careful. Check his pulse.

DIGNAN

Is he breathing?

BOB

I think so.

DIGNAN

Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is that?

BOB

I didn't think there was an alarm.

DIGNAN

Take him to the car, Bob.

DIGNAN

Who tripped the alarm?

ANTHONY

It's the fire alarm.  Somebody

pulled the fire alarm.

DIGNAN

Where's Kumar?

ANTHONY

(looking around)

I don't know.

DIGNAN

Jesus Christ, Anthony.  Did you

lose him?

GUY ON FLOOR

He's in the freezer.

DIGNAN

What?

GUY ON FLOOR

He went in there.

ANTHONY

What for?

ANTHONY

What are you doing?

DIGNAN

Let's go. Come on.

ANTHONY

What were you doing in there?

ANTHONY

Wait for Kumar.

DIGNAN

Come on, Kumar.

BOB

The elevator broke.

DIGNAN

Where's Applejack?

BOB

He's stuck between two floors.

ANTHONY

You're kidding.

DIGNAN

Applejack's stuck in the elevator?

BOB

Yeah.

ANTHONY

Who's got the car keys?

BOB

Applejack drove.

DIGNAN

(pause)

Run. Run. Let's go.

ANTHONY

Jesus, Dignan.

ANTHONY

What the fuck happened to the the

plan?

ANTHONY

Come on.

DIGNAN

I'll see you there.

ANTHONY

What?

DIGNAN

I'll see you there.

ANTHONY

What are you talking about?

DIGNAN

I'll get him.

ANTHONY

There's not enough time.

DIGNAN

Yes, there is. Let's get organized.

ANTHONY

Dignan, it's too late.

DIGNAN

I don't think so.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MR. HENRY

You know, Rowboat. People who smoke

cigarettes die. People who smoke

cigars just keep on going.

MR. HENRY

Sit.

COP

Freeze!

COP #1

Drop the fucking gun!

COP #2

Don't move!

COP #3

You're caught, buddy.

COP #1

Put your hands behind your back.

DIGNAN

I'm not going to do anything.

COP #3

(squeezing his neck)

Why'd you try to run, buddy? Don't

you know what freeze means? Don't

you speak fucking English?

COP #1

Take it easy.

COP #1

(to Dignan)

Calm down.

CUT TO:

BLACKOUT.

DIGNAN

I said to the DA, That cop who hit

me must of given me CRS disease.

BOB

What's that?

DIGNAN

That's just what the DA asked. CRS

is a disease where you can't

remember shit.

ANTHONY

Like amnesia.

DIGNAN

Can't remember shit. CRS.

BOB

Oh.

DIGNAN

Tell Mr. Henry I said that.

DIGNAN

So is Mr. Henry going to come by

and see me or anything?

ANTHONY

(pause)

I don't think so. I mean. Actually,

he robbed Bob's house.

DIGNAN

He did?

ANTHONY

Yeah.

DIGNAN

You got to be kidding me.

ANTHONY

I'm not kidding.

DIGNAN

(pause)

What'd he get?

ANTHONY

Pretty much everything.

DIGNAN

The grandfather clock?

BOB

He got everything.

DIGNAN

Wow.

(pause, looks at Bob)

Sorry, Bob.

DIGNAN

You think Applejack knew?

ANTHONY

(shrugs)

We haven't heard from Applejack

since he got out of the hospital.

His case got dismissed.

DIGNAN

Why?

ANTHONY

We're not sure.

BOB

We think Mr. Henry maybe --

ANTHONY

His health isn't very good, you

know. They take that into account.

DIGNAN

No. That's true.

ANTHONY

Mr. Henry never gave you a test,

did he?

DIGNAN

What do you mean?

ANTHONY

Nothing.

CUT TO:

DIGNAN

You're living on a sailboat?

ANTHONY

(nods)

It belongs to Bob's uncle.

DIGNAN

How big is it?

ANTHONY

Oh, I'd say about --

BOB

It's in the driveway.

ANTHONY

(pause)

Temporarily.

DIGNAN

Where?

ANTHONY

Behind Bob's house.

DIGNAN

Does it float?

ANTHONY

We're not sure yet. It's going to

need some repairs.

ANTHONY

So how is it in there?

(pointing at cell block)

DIGNAN

(shrugs)

What can I say? It's jail. You

don't sleep when you want to. You

don't eat when you want to.

BOB

Do you have your own room?

DIGNAN

We don't have rooms, Bob. We have

cells.

BOB

Do you have your own cell?

DIGNAN

No. I have a cellmate. His name's

Carl.

ANTHONY

What's he in for?

DIGNAN

He stole a tractor.

BOB

Do they let you --

DIGNAN

I don't really want to talk about

it, Bob.

DIGNAN

(with his mouth full

of food)

This sure beats the shit out of the

shit they crap out in this joint.

DIGNAN

(smiling)

I might have to have another one of

these.

CUT TO:

DIGNAN

Thanks for coming.

DIGNAN

Hey.

DIGNAN

I think I may have found a way out

of here.

ANTHONY

(pause)

You're kidding.

DIGNAN

No. I'm not.

ANTHONY

How?

DIGNAN

Shhh. Wait for my instructions.

ANTHONY

Dignan, I --

DIGNAN

When we go through the next gate

you'll have 30 seconds to take out

the tower guard.

ANTHONY

What?

DIGNAN

Have the car running at the north-

west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --

ANTHONY

Dignan, I --

DIGNAN

Scale the barricade and tunnel

through no man's land. And Bob.

Remember:

ANTHONY

Scale the --

DIGNAN

Shield me from the bullets. They

won't shoot civilians. Ready?

BOB

Hold on --

DIGNAN

Here we go.

BOB

Wait a second --

DIGNAN

Now!

DIGNAN

So long.

FADE OUT.
