NINJA ASSASSIN

Written by

Matthew Sand & J. Michael Straczynski

REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08

FADE IN:

CLOSE ON a Horimono Tattoo as it is being drawn into

flesh. The ink is needled into the surface of the skin,

raw and bloody, the needled brush tapped with the

precision of ritual.

The tattoo is in the style of a Kuniyoshi print: Miyamoto

Musashi thrusting his spear into the writhing dragon.

The image has beauty but retains the violence required to

saturate flesh with art.

The skin canvas shifts uncomfortably with the needle-

work.

HOLLYWOOD

Fuck!   Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking-

fuck!

PULL BACK to reveal that we're in...

1   INT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT                                      1

A place of designer furniture, beautiful girls carrying

towels, tea and cigarettes. Dozens of Yakuza look on as

the process continues, sleeves rolled up or shirts off to

expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos.

HOLLYWOOD, the young Yakuza member, is getting his first

tattoo, a relatively small one on his back.

He grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby.

HOLLYWOOD

Watch it, old man!

The old tattoo artist continues tapping his brush.       Maybe

a little harder.

HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)

What the fuck?     You're doing it

wrong.

TATTOO ARTIST

The needle is doing what the

needle does.

HOLLYWOOD

What's that supposed to mean?

TATTOO MASTER

The irezumi does not hide the

skin, the tattoo reveals the

nature of the man and illuminates

the four noble professions in the

Book of Five Rings: the Warrior,

the Artist, the Merchant, and the

farmer. If there is a conflict

between the needle and the skin,

between the mark and the man, then

perhaps the path you have chosen

is not the path for which you are

suited.

HOLLYWOOD

What did you just say, old man?

Hollywood whips his gun out and jams it under the old

man's jaw.

HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)

I know you didn't just disrespect

me, did you? You that fucking

stupid? You disrespect me, and

I'll tattoo this ceiling with your

fucking brains!

The old man speaks with a kind of deference honed through

years of service to men like Hollywood.

TATTOO MASTER

No disrespect.

Hollywood smiles.

HOLLYWOOD

You're lucky. I can't kill you

'til you finish this thing. Gimme

that mirror! How's it looking?

Goons and girls all cluck their tongues in chorus.

Hollywood peers at the new tat through the mirror.         He

whistles approval as Yakuza One enters carrying an

origami envelope.

HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)

Not bad. Not bad. For an old fuck.

YAKUZA ONE

Hey, boss. This just came for you.

HOLLYWOOD

What is it?

YAKUZA ONE

A letter.

HOLLYWOOD

So open it, dumb ass.

He opens the origami envelope, then hesitates at what he

sees.

HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)

What?   What is it?

He pours the contents out into his hand.

YAKUZA ONE

Looks like sand.

He tastes it.

YAKUZA ONE (CONT'D)

Yup. Sand. Black Sand.

The tattoo master drops his brush.     It clatters to the

floor.

TATTOO MASTER

No...

HOLLYWOOD

You know what this is?

The artist barely nods.

HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)

Wanna let us in on the joke?

TATTOO MASTER

Years ago, I watched a man open an

envelope like that one.

His eyes pool with fury at the memory.

TATTOO MASTER (CONT'D)

There were many with him and they

laughed like you laugh now. Then

it came from the shadows and their

laughter was drowned in blood.

You cannot bargain with what is

coming. You cannot reason with it.

Because it is not a human being.

It is a demon sent straight from

hell that will never stop until

you are dead.

HOLLYWOOD

What came out of the shadows?

TATTOO MASTER

I cannot say the word.

HOLLYWOOD

What word?

He pulls open his robe, revealing a hauntingly beautiful

tattoo of a Shinobi demon thrusting its blade into a lump

of scar tissue at the center of his heart.

TATTOO ARTIST

That night, one of their blades

struck here. I should have died,

but for an accident of birth. My

heart is here, on the other side.

Hollywood peers closer at the dark figure of the demon.

HOLLYWOOD

What the fuck is that?

YAKUZA ONE

Looks like a Ninja, boss.

HOLLYWOOD

A ninja? Are you kidding me?

That's the word you're afraid to

say? Ninja?

As he starts to laugh.

HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)

Ninja-Ninja-Ninja!

His laughter is infectious.

HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)

You old fuck! You had me going!

Ninja. That's some good shit.

His Lieutenant laughs hard with him until the top of his

head disappears, sliced off from his jaw up, leaving his

tongue wagging in space.

Lights shatter around the room.

Chaos ensues. The panicked screams of the fleeing

entourage co-mingle in chorus with gruesome death rattles

of Hollywood's foot soldiers as one by one, they are

eviscerated.

There's a RUSH of movement, more felt than seen. The

whistle of swords through the air. Cries and screams.

Guns that fire suddenly and are just as suddenly stilled.

STAY on the face of the Tattoo Master, barely visible in

the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window.

Frozen. Immobile. As the killing continues around him.

Then: silence, broken by the sound of heavy, desperate

BREATHING, and a MATCH being struck by Hollywood who

looks up --

-- and sees a dark figures standing before him. Everyone

else is dead. Only he and the Tattoo Master remain. The

figure regards him with still silence. For perhaps the

first time in his life, Hollywood is terrified.

HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)

Listen... you don't have to do

this! Whatever you're getting

paid, I'll triple it! You hear me!

I'll pay you whatever you want!

Just name your price!

Their answer is silence. Hollywood sees his guns nearby.

With a desperate scream, he THROWS the match in the air

as he DIVES for his guns, grabbing one in each hand.

There is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed

hands are tumbling gracefully through the air.

The blade swings again, slicing through his body as if it

were barely there, coming out the other side as --

-- Hollywood's body erupts as it falls in two pieces,

splattering the artist with blood.

The match touches the floor and goes out.

The Tattoo Master does not move, has not moved.    Frozen.

TATTOO ARTIST

But you are real, aren't you?

After a moment, the ninja emerges into the moonlight, the

way a shadow coalesces into a panther gliding from the

dark to inspect its kill.

The artist doesn't move, but his eyes widen, his heart

pounding in his ears.

TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)

For fifty-seven-years, I've told

your story...

TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)

No one ever believed

me.

The ninja walks towards him, his steps soundless. He

crouches down, his eyes taking in the old man's tattoo.

TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)

But you are real, aren't you?

There's the shing of a sword being unsheathed.    The

artist closes his eyes, anticipating death.

Silence. He waits for the death blow. It does not come.

He finally forces himself to open his eyes.

The ninja is gone, having departed as silently as he

came, leaving death and blood in his wake.

CUT TO:

2   INT. ISTANBUL SUPERMARKET AISLE - DAY                      2

A roll of toilet paper drops into a cart. PULL BACK to

REVEAL RAIZO, 20s, slim and sinewy, his expression

distant, almost haunted. He considers the toothpaste

options for a moment, then drops in one of those too.

Moves on to food.

Turkish Muzak plays in the background, a Beatles song,

"Helter Skelter" by way of Turkish musicians. Other

SHOPPERS cruise past in their own private quests.

Raizo gets quick, easy bachelor food: six eggs, a single

stick of butter, several handfuls of noodle packages.

3   INT. ISTANBUL SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT - MOMENTS LATER      3

Raizo waits while the CHECKER - a pretty young woman -

tallies up his groceries.

CHECKER

That's a lot of noodles.

Are you a student? Tourist?   Here

Raizo shakes his head to all three.

She winks at him.       Very cute.

RAIZO

I don't think so. Sorry.

No smile. No emotion in Raizo's face. He pays in cash.

He picks up the bag and starts away when --

CHECKER

So if you're not a student, and

you're not a tourist, and you're

not here to work... what are you

doing?

RAIZO

Waiting.

CHECKER

For what?

RAIZO

For the wheel to turn.

And he exits.

4   EXT. ISTANBUL, STREET - DAY                                  4

Ancient gateway between Asia and Europe. Minarets thrust

up from the tangled streets into the bright Aegean sky.

The street is crowded with bicycles, cars and motorcycles

as Raizo makes his way down a narrow sidewalk.

OZUNU (V.O.)

Wherever you are, wherever you may

go....

5   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHT               5

We're in a heavily shadowed room, lit with flickering

candles as an older man, OZUNU -- hard-edged and

unforgiving -- talks to his clan.

OZUNU

you are, how you came to be. You

He closes the door behind him.

7   INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS               7

He stands on the other side of the door, surveying the

room for a moment with severe, unforgiving eyes. The

place is monastic, nothing decorative, or comfortable.

Then, in a quick series of cuts, he checks all of the

secret places he hides things.

A drawer is flipped over and a hidden bottom opens

revealing weapons. A panel in the oven reveals his chain

and blade. A hidden compartment in his suitcase exposes

inky folds of fabric. He sifts through them as we hear-

OZUNU (V.O.)

You should have died.

8   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DOJO - DAY                      8

Raizo, breathing hard, stands over another young boy that

he has just defeated in a fight. Both are sweaty, dirty,

scarred. The other children are lined up in perfect

rows, watching silently. Most are boys, but a few are

girls. One of them is KIRIKO, lithe and supple, a

child's eyes haunted by an adult's sorrows and knowledge.

Ozunu circles Raizo as he regards his fallen opponent.

OZUNU

On the street. Abandoned by your

parents. Without a home. Without

people to care for you. You

should have done as most children

do, and gone quietly from this

world, to the next.

(beat)

But, instead you fought. As you

did here today. You fought. And

you won.

As we TRACK with Ozunu, we see that Raizo's body is

covered in scars.

OZUNU (CONT'D)

Scars are the calligraphy of

violence, Raizo. They inscribe

the story of one's life.

MIKA

Ozunu. I think. I've been going

through some of the original

transcripts of the trial of

Kunitomo Shigeaki. The prosecutor

questioned him about a payment of

100 pounds of gold. Shigeaki

answered that he didn't know what

the prosecutor was talking about.

The question was never brought up

again. But what pinged for me was

the amount- the exact same amount

rumored to be paid to the Hattori

Clan for the assassination of Lord

Sanda.

MASLOW

So you start to wonder, in this

ever changing world, if the cost

of a man's life has remained

constant.

MIKA

Exactly. I figure these clans are

like a thousand years old. They

probably don't change a lot.

I started looking at international

wire transfers, targeting banks in

the regions of several high-

Look, no one's denying the

historical record, Mika. But the

whole idea just doesn't fit in

with a modern world. It's like

one of those questions on an IQ

belong in this sentence: laptops,

space shuttles, nanotechnology,

ninjas.

MIKA

They're real Ryan. You can call

them spooks, or assassins, or

whatever you want if it makes you

feel better, but they're out

there. They're killing people and

nobody is doing a damn thing to

stop them.

We sense a strange tension between them as we realize

they are alone in the midnight cleaners. He looks at

her. She smiles. The uneven strobing on either side of

the Laundromat casts uneven shadows on her face... almost

as though she had two faces. One light, one shadow. We

EXTEND the silence for a long BEAT until he looks down at

the sheet and says:

RAIZO

What clan are you from?

She glances up sharply.

PRETTY WOMAN

I... don't understand...

RAIZO

You came alone. The Ozunu clan

would never make such a mistake.

Her eyes REACT as suddenly a blade flashes from beneath

the sheet, reaching for Raizo's throat.

A fury of slashes and the sheet is shredded.

What is going on-

The space is empty, glowing with fluorescent glare.

One machine is thumping loudly.    He crosses to it.

A report. A friend of mine in

MASLOW (CONT'D)

It was written during the height

of the Cold War by a high ranking

KGB agent named Aleksei Sabatin.

In it, he raises the possibility

that several political

assassinations were conducted by

an ancient but very sophisticated

is going to eat or not.

OZUNU

The world feeds on the weak.

18    FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHTINGALE        18

FLOOR - NIGHT

Young Raizo stands in the central chamber of the

compound. The floor beneath his bare feet is made of

thousands of carefully mitred pieces of gleaming wood

laid down in an intricate pattern. They are not,

however, glued down to the floor. The slightest wrong

move will make them shift noisily.

This is our first look at the Nightingale Floor.

OZUNU

Suffering exists only because                       *

weakness exists.

Ozunu watches from the far side of the room as Raizo

takes his first step. Carefully. Graceful as any

dancer.

He makes no sound.

OZUNU (CONT'D)

You must hate all weakness. Hate                    *

it in others, but most of hate it                   *

in yourself.

He takes another step, and another.    Each soft as a

falling feather.

He is a third of the way across the floor - his body

gleaming with sweat - when he steps wrong and the floor

sings beneath him.

Raizo stops, a flash of panic in his eyes. Then he

subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending

foot, holds it out as Ozunu rises and approaches.

Ozunu lays open Raizo's foot with a bamboo rod.      Slashing

blows that leave deep cuts.

SABATIN (V.O.)

(Russian accent)

Historical evidence suggests that

Ibn-Battuta's journey through the

far east brought him into contact

with what might be one of the

oldest of the Nine Clans. He

travels with a group of orphans

that are being taken from a city

devastated by war to the Shido of

the Ozunu clan. The people of the

surrounding province refer to the

Shido as "The Orphanage."

22    FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DOJO                             22

We see Battuta, the 14th century Muslim explorer sitting

among the original leaders of the Ozunu clan, watching

two children fight.

SABATIN (V.O.)

Battuta describes a ceremonial

dinner followed by a display of

martial skill. The combatants

were children neither beyond the

age of ten.

Battuta masks his revulsion as the battle continues until

one child beats the other to death. Small fists gleam

with blood as one boy pummels the other.

SABATIN (CONT'D)

His host explains that a man's

life must be made meaningless

compared to the life of the Clan.

Own the meaning of a man's life

and you own his heart.

Slowly the light in the bedroom hallway goes OUT.

She freezes, and the world seems to freeze with her.      She

doesn't move, doesn't breathe.

She forces herself to sit slowly up, reaching under her

bed for a cricket bat. A car drives by outside. Could

be nothing. Could be everything.

Despite her fear, she edges toward the door. Slowly

peers around it. The darkened hall is empty.

There is a ticking sound, like someone tapping at a

window. Could be a tree in the wind. Could be something

else.

She moves slowly through her apartment.   Every shadow

could conceal unseen eyes.

She comes to the end of the hall, where the overhead

light is out. She flicks the switch on and off.

Nothing. She reaches carefully toward the light bulb.

Taps it. The bulb rattles, it's just burned out. She

breathes a sigh of relief. Then she notices --

-- that the living room window is open, the blinds gently

swaying from the wind, tapping against the sash.

She closes it and locks it. Looks to her desk,

concerned. Did she leave the window open? Or is

something going on.

She goes to her desk, anxious, to check on something.

She opens a drawer, revealing a box of tampax. Pulls out

the tampax to reveal a key... a place no guy would think

to check.

She unlocks a drawer and takes out an unmarked DVD in a

slim plastic case. Relieved, she starts to put it

away...then stops. Is it the same DVD? She moves OS.

MOMENTS LATER... the TV is switched on, and an image

begins to play, revealing a time coded security camera,

recording an urban street corner in Japan. The tape is

riddled with digital noise and artifacting.

Then, slowly, the digital noise seems to coalesce, to

grow shapes. The shadows come to life.

Then with incredible speed two dark figures start

battling it out, their blades striking sparks that are

still descending after they've slipped back into the

shadows.

They emerge over and over, brief flashes of clarity like

the perfect arc of a calligrapher's brush describing the

wing of a bird. Fight. Retreat. Silence. Shadows.

Sparks.

Mika hits the pause button and moves closer to the

screen, examining the figures.

One of the figures is wearing a mask, but the face of the

other combatant is revealed, albeit somewhat obscured by

the dim light and digital noise.

know that name yet.

MIKA

She stares at the fierce beauty of his face and touches

the screen gently.

22Aa   INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY                   22Aa

CLOSE on a bed of nails; sixteen penny nails arranged in

perfect rows pointing up, the sharp tips catching the

light.

As we REVEAL Raizo his breathing is rhythmic and deep,

but this is really the first time we have heard him sound

like he is straining.

As we continue to WIDEN, we discover the reason for this:

he is doing handstand push-ups. On the nails. Over and

over, with little apparent effort.

The hard edges and lines of his body catch the light,

like the tips of the nails, as we HEAR:

OZUNU (V.O.)

Strength is the only virtue that

nature respects.

Young Raizo looks up and sees young Kiriko looking at

him. She smiles. He looks back to his weapon.

22B    EXT. ISTANBUL - STREET - DAY                             22B

Raizo walks down a street where repair work is being

done. To keep cars from falling into the hole, they've

covered the street with big steel plates. As the cars

and trucks pass over the plates, they make a bump-thump

sound. Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump. We PUSH IN

on Raizo under that sound.

intuitively sifting through interconnected threads of

Searching through what is known about Ibu-Battuta, she

discovers information concerning the lost chapters of the

century.

She remains immersed until a sound grows louder and

louder.

A vacuum cleaner. She checks the time. Very late. She

crack in her open door.

Startled she gets up while the eyes quickly disappear.

In the hallway, an older Asian man is pushing the vacuum

The report caused "problems" for

Alexei's career the way Moses

caused problems for the Pharaoh,

you see? Very unpleasant.

Terrible people saying terrible

things.

After he retired...was asked to

retire...we moved, first to

Byelorussia and then here to

Berlin when the wall came down.

He said this will be a good place

to grow old together. And it was,

for a time.

MIKA

What happened?

She looks off, shakes her head.

MRS. SABATIN

About two years ago...two? Yes,

after the assassination of Zhukov,

the report drew attention. After

that, everything was different.

38    FLASHBACK - EXT. SABATIN HOME - DAY                          38

As Alexei supervises, workmen install locks, put in

fencing material, hang lights and video cameras on the

outside of the house.

MRS. SABATIN (V.O.)

Alexei hired men to change all the

locks, and put in more of them.

Locks on the windows, locks on the

doors, locks on the locks. He put

in cameras and motion sensors and

lights...everywhere, lights.

The lights SNAP on, illuminating the back of the house

with brilliant klieg lights.

MRS. SABATIN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

"There can be no shadows," he

said. "No shadows."

CLOSER on Mrs. Sabatin as she looks down at her tea.

MRS. SABATIN

I will tell you a true thing, and

a hard thing. My husband was a

soldier. A member of Russian

intelligence. He had seen many

terrible things....

(beat)

He was not a man to frighten

easily.

MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)

But from that day on, when the sun

went down behind the hills...in

his eyes, I saw the fear a child

has of the dark.

(beat)

Then, one day, a man came to the

door.

39    FLASHBACK - INT/EXT. SABATIN HOUSE - DAY                     39

We are over the shoulder of someone who could be Raizo or

Takeshi as the door opens revealing Alexei.

After a moment Alexi invites the man in. A security

camera watches them enter the house.

MRS. SABATIN (V.O.)

They talked in Alexei's study for

sometime. Then the young man

left.

Mrs. Sabatin watches the young man leave then hurries

toward the study door.

MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)

It was unlike Alexei not to see

him out. I remember being very

scared. But when I opened the

door, he was just sitting there.

For a moment, he didn't even

notice me. Then he stood up and

kissed me and told me that he

loved me very much. He said I

should always remember that.

We see Alexei looking shell-shocked, eyes hollowed, as he

stands and kisses his wife. His eyes begin to shimmer

with tears but before he cries, he leaves.

39A   BACK TO SCENE                                               39A

MIKA

Do you know what they talked

about?

MRS. SABATIN

No. Alexei never spoke about it.

But two months later, he was dead.

MIKA

Can I ask how he died?

40    FLASHBACK - EXT. SABATIN HOUSE - NIGHT                      40

The lights have come on outside his house. Alexei comes

out, a gun in hand, shielding his eyes. Searching for

whatever set off the automatic lights.

Then, suddenly: darkness.

And sudden MOVEMENT in the shadows that LUNGES toward

Alexei.

40A   As Mrs. Sabatin shakes her head, looks away.    Shrugs.    40A

MRS. SABATIN

The lights went out.

She looks to Mika.   That says it all.   She rises.

MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)

You are the first person who has

taken my husband's work seriously.

It would be good to know that he

did not die without cause. Come

with me.

Mika follows her into --

-- an adjoining room, where Mrs. Sabatin pulls the bottom

drawer of a bureau out and sets it on the floor. From

the darkness she removes a metal box.

MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)

He would want you to have this.

41    INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY                       41

Raizo sits alone. Crossed-legged on the floor. Utterly

still.

There's an ocean of sound swirling around him.    The

cacophony of Instanbul evening rush hour.

Raizo starts to build a dam; auricular sandbags laid one

by one, walling off the outside world.

The traffic outside- horns, engines, squealing tires,

rattling trucks chassis- all fade away.

People shouting, singing. A couple next door making love.

A baby wailing. Jackhammers pounding...

Slowly, the world fades away, until there is only one

sound. Faint, familiar, but almost too quiet to hear...

She shifts nervously, no poker face.    She turns and leads

him into her home office.

With the key from the tampax box she opens the drawer.

Maslow watches as she pulls out the contents of Sabatin's

box as well as the illegally requisitioned evidence.

MIKA

Most of this is from Sabatin.

Copies of what I think are the

lost chapters of the Rihle. I

think it describes the original

location of the Ozunu Clan but my

14th century Arabic is a little

rusty.

MASLOW

And this?

Meaning the DVD.

MIKA

That's how it started. I made a

mistake, mixed up the case code

and they sent me that.

A moment later the DVD is playing, Raizo and the other

ninja dancing through the shadows.

MASLOW

...Christ.

MIKA

Yeah. I know. I don't understand

why they're fighting though. It

could be a clan war.

Maslow starts to put it together.

MASLOW

So you requisitioned this by

accident. You used my code which

is why you didn't want to show me

this. Which is also why they're

tearing apart my office right now.

Just routine. The agency cares

about its field operatives. We

monitor for signs of stress,

fatigue, mental exhaustion. Agent

Maslow has a serious case load.

That much work can wear on a man.

This agency is subject to the

our authority. If a case is

marked DNP we must respect the

jurisprudence of the regional

government and act accordingly.

MASLOW

I understand that sir but-

JAMISON

Let me be clear, Agent Maslow. In

the eyes of the law these

materials do not exist. If so,

than there is no case and if there

Yeah, well usually if someone

introduces themselves it is a

convention that the other person

does likewise.

RAIZO

Raizo...is the name I was given.

MIKA

So, you were an orphan?

MIKA (CONT'D)

Interesting nature verses nurture

case study I imagine.

MIKA (CONT'D)

If it's okay with you, I'll try to

fill in some of the blanks. You

must have been taken by the Ozunu

clan, trained to be an assassin,

but something happened and you

decided to opt out of the program.

I don't imagine this went over so

well and since they're after me

for just peeking through the

keyhole, they must be after you in

a major way. But you are also

after them or you wouldn't have

bothered going to Sabatin. Which

I figure means you're searching

for the location of The Orphanage

because that's obviously the only

information Battatu's book would

have that you wouldn't already

know.

MIKA (CONT'D)

Yeah, I got some moves too. I'm

pretty lethal with the research

thing.

But here's a question I can't

answer: since you didn't know I

went to Sabatin's, why did you

save me?

RAIZO

Ninja only kill two kinds of

people. The first kind has power

and money. The other kind is

trying to stop them.

CLOSE as he picks the lock of a different car trunk.

MIKA

Wow. They teach you that at ninja

school?

RAIZO

Most locks are not worth the metal

they're made of.

The trunk pops open. Raizo tosses their bag of clothes

under the lid of the tire compartment. Then closes the

door.

He leads her down the parking lot sizing up the cars,

until he finds one he likes.

MIKA

You're going to steal a car?

Just borrow it.

The door opens.

streaking her pale and terrified face.

89A   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - VAULT - NIGHT                              89A

Mika charges into the holding area, the detail of men

right at her heels.

EUROPOL WATER GUARD

Hold your fire--

Raizo's guards release their aim.

EUROPOL GUARD

Christ--

EUROPOL WATER GUARD

Good way to get yourself killed,

Agent Coretti.

EUROPOL #2

What the fuck's with the lights?

EUROPOL GUARD

We got some guys in pajamas comin'

to play spin the bottle.

One of them lifts a shotgun.

EUROPOL #2

Huh huh. I got something they can

wrap their lips around.

MIKA

I don't have time for this shit.

We have to move the prisoner.

In the back of his cell, Raizo's head lifts at the sound

of Mika's voice.

RAIZO

Mika!

EUROPOL WATER GUARD

No ma'am. Those aren't our orders.

Raizo calls from behind the reinforced door.

RAIZO

You've got to get out of here!

She calls to his cell.

MIKA

Not without you.

Raizo's voice hangs in the gloom.

RAIZO

Then we all die together.

89B   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                    89B

One of the teams edges through the decay of the

dilapidated industrial cavern.

Straining through the eyepiece of his goggles one of them

mutters.

EUROPOL AGENT 2

Don't see shit--

Ahead the point man motions and the men take up defensive

positions.

The point man creeps forward, a flicker of heat

fluttering in his IR-Optic.

POINT MAN

Is that..?

Through the darkness we see that his infrared is actually

picking up the slow exhale of a ninja poised like a cobra

inches away just above him.

His blades flash--

And the detail of men recoil as their infrared sensors

light up, the point man cleft open in hot volcanic gore.

A cloud of shuriken spit out of the darkness and punch

into necks, faces, eyes. Ten of them fall like wheat

before a scythe. The rest fire hitting nothing.

MIKA

Shh!

RAIZO

I don't want to sound critical--

He can feel the rush of darkness.

MIKA

Got it!

The leg irons click open and Raizo springs forward the

chain of his handcuffs catching a falling blade. He

twists and the ring of metal on metal is followed by the

dry snap of bone as Raizo breaks the ninja's neck.

She releases his handcuffs and they move quickly through

the glistening remains of the bodies, Raizo shielding her

from the darkness.

90A   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - SUBLEVEL - NIGHT                           90A

The two sprint from a stairwell into a concourse, Raizo

stopping suddenly, sensing the presence of the Hanta-

Kirra.

He pushes her toward another set of stairs.

RAIZO

Go. Find Maslow.

He turns to facing the dark.

RAIZO (CONT'D)

Go quick.

She lurches up the stairs as the Hanta-Kirra descend on

him like a murder of crows.

90B   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - STAIRWELL - NIGHT                          90B

Mika flies up the stairs taking the steps two at a time

rounding the next flight--

A beam of light flashing weapons rattling suddenly

trained on her.

MASLOW

Her stomach finds its way into her throat.

MIKA

Jesus Ryan--

Maslow rushes down to her, another agent scanning the

stairs above them.

MASLOW

I thought you were--

Mika's eyes widen as the agent on the flight above them

is ripped into the air replaced by a squall of red.

Maslow whirls as a blade suddenly pierces his side--

But before it can continue its deadly cut, Maslow catches

it in a bloody fist and fires into the shadows.

One of the Hanta-Kirra falls tumbling past them down the

stairs.

Maslow grunts as he rips the chain blade from his side.

MIKA

Are you ok?

He nods, a bit woozy.

MASLOW

I hope that wasn't my liver. Gonna

need that soon.

MIKA

Come on.

Herbalist places herbs into a hand-grinder as Raizo

staggers through the rows of bowls, grabbing what he

needs and handing it to her.

RAIZO

...dong-xia leaves...three of the

lo-chan...dragon root...

HERBALIST

You should not mix these.    Very

dangerous.

Raizo ignores him. Gives her some more dried bits and

pieces. The herbalist shakes his head.

HERBALIST (CONT'D)

If you are in pain...if you wish

to die...there are other ways,

this will be agony --

RAIZO

No...it will save me....

HERBALIST

It will?  You're sure?

(beat)

Let me write this down.

He goes to find a pen and paper as Mika grinds away.

RAIZO

Hot water.

She goes to a tea kettle, pours water into the bowl.   He

reaches for it, and nearly collapses.

She helps him raise the cup to his lips. Tilts it and

watches him drink. Takes the empty cup away from him.

Raizo shudders as the drugs course through him.

RAIZO (CONT'D)

I have to sleep now...a day at

least.

His eyelids flutter.    She's holding him up now - muscles

already loosening.

MIKA

A day?!?     What should I do?

He slumps over the counter like a child dropping into

deepest sleep as --

-- the herbalist comes back, pen and paper in hand. He

pauses as he sees Mika standing over Raizo. She looks

from him to Raizo and back again, then:

MIKA

I'll have him to go.

MASLOW

MIKA

Moving.   He told me to keep

MASLOW

He's still alive?

She glances at his slumped body.

MIKA

After a fashion.

She looks at him.

MIKA (CONT'D)

I'm a forensic researcher, okay?

That's like a fancy way of saying

I'm a librarian. By myself I

can't do anything to help you.

She opens her fist; inside is the tracking device Maslow

gave her.

MIKA (CONT'D)

I wanted to think you for saving

my life.

Bending over him, she kisses him gently.

MIKA (CONT'D)

And I hope you can forgive me for

this.

An AIDE rushes in from an adjoining room, goes to Maslow.

The bed is empty. Raizo is gone.

Mika is sitting in the chair.

MIKA

They took him.     Ten minutes ago.

He's gone.

Maslow embraces her.

111   FLASHBACK - INT ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT                  111

There is a furious storm raging outside       the thin

screened walls.

Raizo is watching Kiriko who seems to be sleeping.

In a flash of lightning, her eyes open and she stares at

him and he feels in hi heart what she is saying goodbye.

The flashing ends and as the thunder booms, she is gone,

melting quietly into the shadows.

RAIZO

...no!

Because my heart is telling me

RAIZO

The Hanta Kirra will come for you.

KIRIKO

Then they will come.

RAIZO

You know the law. He will cut your

heart from your chest.

She smiles.

KIRIKO

No...He can never touch my heart.

She puts his hand on her chest, then leans in and kisses

him.

KIRIKO (CONT'D)

Come with me.

RAIZO

Where? What is out there?

KIRIKO

Life.

He cannot imagine what that life might be.

RAIZO

...My life is here.

She bows her head and turns.

RAIZO (CONT'D)

Why are you doing this?

KIRIKO

Because I can't watch you become

something you are not.

She races for the wall.

He watches her climb...And disappear.

Raizo drifts on the edge of consciousness. He can sense

some light filtering through the edges and air holes.

The air begins to smell familiar.

OZUNU (V.O.)

We have been betrayed.

114   FLASHBACK - EXT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD - DAY              114

The clan is gathered outside, the sun beats down on the

Spartan courtyard.

Kiriko's body is twisted, bound to a pole like one of the

Bonsai trees.

Ozunu delivers his eulogy.

OZUNU

A child of mine, my daughter,

betrayed us. She refused these

gifts. Rejected our clan.

Raizo stands among the clan; his face a mask.

OZUNU (CONT'D)

Hers is a shame that can only be

purged with blood.

He unsheathes the ancient Wakizashi, then offers the hilt

to Takeshi.

OZUNU (CONT'D)

You who returned her shall have

this honor.

Takeshi hides a smile as he takes the blade.

Kiriko looks out into the clan and finds Raizo.      He can

hear her heart pounding.

Takeshi knows where she is looking as he prepares to

strike.

Blood pounds in Raizo's ears.

The sword plunges into her heart.    Raizo hears it die-

And feels his own heart stop.

115   INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD - NIGHT                           115

A bucket of water slaps Raizo awake.

He's bound to a pole in the middle of the courtyard by

thick rope that bites into his flesh.

Ozunu stands before him, as well as the rest of the clan,

down to the youngest of them. Watching silently.

He looks the same as he has in the flashbacks - except

that now an ugly scar runs diagonally across the length

of his face. Trace of Raizo's blade from atop the

building in Dubai.

When he speaks, Ozunu is speaking for the benefit of the

rest of the clan as to Raizo.

OZUNU

You are Ozunu. Your life is

meaningless compared to the

survival of the Clan. This is our

deepest truth. Because of it, we

have endured for hundreds of

years, and will endure for

hundreds more.

He looks to the rest, pounding the message home.       The

message that says hope and escape are futile.

OZUNU (CONT'D)

Weakness compels strength.

Betrayal begets blood. This is

the way of the Nine Clans.

(beat)

This is the way of the Ninja.

He looks back at Raizo, approaching slowly.       Taking his

time.

OZUNU (CONT'D)

I have waited many years for this

moment. I have dreamed it, many

times.

He hits Raizo.    Hard.

OZUNU (CONT'D)

You will suffer for seven days,

one day for each year you defied

me.

He takes a knife, and very carefully cuts out a very

small piece of Raizo's flesh, from the upper arm. Raizo

doesn't cry out.

OZUNU (CONT'D)

For seven days, we

will...take...from you, as I have

just done. Everyone here will

take from you. Piece by piece.

You will live through it all, you

will feel through it all. You

will watch as the birds fight over

the pieces.

He STRIKES Raizo as he did long ago, his hand jutting

deep inside gut, flicking switches of nerves that cause

instant agony. This time Raizo does cry out.

OZUNU (CONT'D)

You will know pain like no other

human being has ever known.

He twists something in Raizo's belly and violent spasms

wrack the young man's body. Blood burbles up through his

mouth and flows down his chin.

Your death will be remembered for

a thousand years as a testament to

the will and strength of the Ozunu

Clan.

One last gouge in Raizo's stomach sends a heaving shudder

through him.

Confident, victorious, Ozunu turns and walks a few steps

away as --

-- Raizo coughs up a bloody wad onto the clean floor.

Takeshi smiles at this, then looks more closely, seeing

something amidst the bile...

TAKESHI

Father...

Ozunu looks down and sees a tiny steel cylinder.    A

single LED light blinking through the gore.

He nudges it with his foot...and TIME SLOWS DOWN as he

realizes what he's looking at. He slowly raises his eyes

--

-- and meets Raizo's gaze as suddenly --

-- EXPLOSIONS rock the orphanage's centuries-old gate.

A reinforced military Humvee crashes through the cloud of

splintering timber with a roar and an explosion of

blinding lights.

The Ozunu Clan scatters as the massive vehicle heaves

into the courtyard, revealing behind it still more

vehicles, all equipped with brilliant lights.

The ninjas take to the shadows, trying to melt away, but

the shadows are gone. There's no place for the ninjas to

hide anymore. We FIND Mika and Maslow in one of the lead

vehicles as --

-- Takeshi draws his blade in a smooth arc, raising it

over Raizo's helpless form.

Maslow takes aim with his submachine gun and squeezes off

a long burst.

Takeshi blocks some of the slugs with his sword and

dodges the others. He slides into one of the few

remaining shadows.

One of the soldiers sees him making a break for it and

fires an incendiary grenade.

The explosion sends incandescent white phosphorous

splashing through the courtyard, but Takeshi is gone.

They prepare to fire another one when Maslow comes on the

run.

MASLOW

No more grenades, not until we get

the children out!

But some parts of the orphanage are already on fire, the

flames spreading through the ancient timbers.

The carnage continues.

Maslow fires at the fleeing ninjas as Mika rushes for

Raizo, pistol in hand.

One of the MP's screams as a shuriken rips open his face

as other Mps FIRE back at the ninja, tearing him apart

with gunfire.

Mika makes it to Raizo's side.

He smiles at her as she saws through the rope with her

knife.

RAIZO

What took you?

MIKA

You knew I'd come?

RAIZO

Just because I was asleep doesn't

mean I couldn't hear you.

Mika finishes with the rope. Raizo pulls free and

reaches for a fallen ninja's sword and chain.

RAIZO (CONT'D)

And I forgive you.

Mika looks back at the sound of GUNFIRE tearing apart

another ninja. When she looks back --

-- Raizo is gone.

bamboo furniture to paper shoji screens to polished

wooden floors as --

the futons smoldering.

Raizo continues into the next hall to find --

-- Takeshi waiting for him. An apparition in the

wavering blaze of heat, silhouetted against a wall of

fire.

TAKESHI

Come, little brother, let us play

like old times

They spring at other. Meeting in the middle of the

hallway as the flames dance around them...recalling the

lanterns they used to fight through, in the days of their

training.

Their weapons ring out a frenzied drum roll of steel on

steel. Neither giving an inch. Evenly matched in skill

and ferocity. Locking together for a moment Takeshi

smiles.

TAKESHI (CONT'D)

No death tasted as sweet as hers.

Raizo's back glistens orange in the firelight, sweat

pouring as he strains, attacks, defends and attacks

again.

Takeshi jumps over them, twists mid-air and ducks low

beneath Raizo's swinging chain as --

-- Raizo stumbles back on the polished floor, blocking

Takeshi's attack, but --

-- Takeshi catches his wrist in an iron grip. As he

brings his sword around, Raizo gets a loop of chain

around the blade and locks it tight.

Both men spin in their sudden embrace.   Faces inches from

each other.

TAKESHI (CONT'D)

I watched you die when I pierced

her heart. You have always been

too weak to be Ozunu.

Takeshi's finger trips a hidden button on the sword.

The blade retracts back through the handle and a yard of

steel jolts out from the hilt of Takeshi's sword.

He moves to slam it into Raizo's side...but Raizo FLIPS

over him, holding onto the hilt and as he lands he --

-- DRIVES the steel into Takeshi's heart. He still

stands for a BEAT, more by inertia than will, then

slumps, dead, to the floor.

Raizo stalks down the hall.    One last task ahead of him.

117   INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE NIGHTINGALE FLOOR/MASTERS      117

ROOM/ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

Raizo walks across the Nightingale floor, his bloody

footprints moving soundlessly.

From the shadows he hears Ozunu's voice

OZUNU

You have not forgotten your

training. You will always be

mine, child.

Raizo stops, considers this, then continues; his

footsteps now bringing every sound possible.

Ozunu steps out of the darkness, as though shrugging off

a cloak of midnight.

OZUNU (CONT'D)

Perhaps this is the best way for

you to die.

His blade rises as like a Cobra's hood, while the chain

blade begins to spin.

RAIZO

The breath I take after you are

dead, will be the first of my

life.

Raizo unleashes all his fury: The chain cutting with the

power of an enormous buzz saw--

Hacking timbers in half--

Carving scars in the floors and walls--

Braziers are thrown, fumes begin to spread but--

Ozunu blocks or evades, absorbing the assault patiently

Waiting for Raizo to tire, waiting for an opening.

118   EXT. ORPHANAGE - COURTYARD - NIGHT                             118

A portion of the Orphanage's wall burns through.        Mika

spots Raizo through the flames.

She runs for him.

119   INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT               119

Raizo begins to weaken. An attack misses wrapping a beam

and Ozunu has his opening-

His assault is ferocious.

Wounds begin opening like windows shears of blood

billowing out.

Raizo retreats, his chain just blocking, catching, or

deflecting the whirlwind attack until--

One sound cuts through the furious fight.

Snap-zoom to Ozunu's ear as--

The hammer is cocked, a cylinder spinning into place.

MIKA

Die you fuck!

She fires and Ozunu twists enough so that the bullet

grazes him.

OZUNU

Bitch!

A scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor.

But the distraction gives Raizo his chance.

The blade whistles, the chain snaps and blood arcs out of

Ozunu.

Rage thunders the hall.

Mika gets back up and aims but--

Ozunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as

he disappears.

MIKA

Raizo

She cannot see him.

Ozunu's attack hits Raizo with the force of a bomb burst,

his blade shatters through Raizo's chain--

Hurling him back, petals of blood fluttering from his

chest.

Raizo tries to recover, his chain now in two pieces.

RAIZO

Mika! Run!

MIKA

Where is he?   I can't see him!

RAIZO

Get away!

Ozunu emerges from the smoke behind her, a wraith. His

eyes are as black as the sockets of a skull.

She spins around but is too late.

The ancient blade runs straight through her chest just as-

-

Raizo finds them.

He sees Kiriko, the same blade taking her life and howls--

His pain a force of nature unleashed.

The chain blades crackle in the air-

Dual cyclones that batter Ozunu's parrying blade which-

Finally shatters against Raizo's fury.

And with a final scream, Raizo lunges at his master, the

whistling blades lazering through his body until he

separates, pieces hanging in mid-air, like an unstitched

rag doll.

Raizo throws down the blood slick blades and--

--hurries to Mika's side. He picks Mika up and walks

through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the

door.

120   EXT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD - NIGHT                          120

The fighting is over now.     All the combatant ninjas dead

or long gone.

Maslow sees Raizo emerge from the smoke and flames,

carrying Mika in his arms.

MASLOW

Mika!

He runs to her side as Raizo lays her gently on the

ground.

MASLOW (CONT'D)

What happened?

RAIZO

She saved my life.

Raizo puts his hand on her chest. Closes his eyes.          We

can FEEL her heart-beat. Bump-thump. Bump-thump.

Raizo opens his eyes.

RAIZO (CONT'D)

She will be all right.

MASLOW

How can you be sure?

Raizo touches her face as she takes in a sudden breath.

He smiles distantly.

RAIZO

Her heart is special.

MIKA

Medic!    Over here now!

Several medics rush to them, Raizo gently laying her on

the stretcher.

As they immediately begin working on her, Raizo fades

back.

Maslow remains at her side.

Her eyes flutter open.

MASLOW

Is she going to be okay?

MEDIC

I don't know...she's got a hole

right through the middle of her

heart...but shes not really

bleeding, that badly...

MIKA

My heart...

She points to the right side of her chest.

MIKA (CONT'D)

...is over here.

MASLOW

...you gotta be fucking kidding

me.

MIKA

...Raizo?

MASLOW

He said you saved his life.

She smiles.

MASLOW (CONT'D)

So you kept your promise. Can we

go home now?

121    EXT. ORPHANAGE BONSAI GARDEN - DAY                         121

Raizo stands among the bound trees.

RAIZO (V.O.)

You shouldn't do that.

122    FLASHBACK - EXT ORPHANAGE BONSAI GARDEN - DAY              122

Kiriko releases one of the trees.

KIRIKO

I believe the heart of a tree

knows which way it needs to grow.

CUT TO:

122A   Raizo releases a tree.                                    122A

(V.O.)

Trees don't have hearts.

KIRIKO (V.O.)

Everything has a heart.

RAIZO

I don't.

123   FLASHBACK - EXT: ORPHANAGE BONSAI GARDEN - DAY               123

She listens to his heart.

KIRIKO

Hello...hello in there. It said it

was happy to meet me and that it

missed you.

CUT TO:

124   EXT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD/WALL - DAY                          124

He stands and looks at the wall.

125   FLASHBACK - EXT ORPHANAGE COURTYARD/WALL - NIGHT             125

The storm lashes against them.

KIRIKO

Come with me!

CUT TO:

126   EXT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD/WALL - DAY                          126

He begins to climb.

CUT TO:

127   FLASHBACK - EXT. ORPHANAGE WALL - NIGHT                      127

She kisses him.

CUT TO:

128   EXT. ORPHANAGE WALL - DAY                                    128

We hear his heartbeat. Bump-thump Bump-thump.

As he stands on the edge of the wall.

In the next moment he is gone-

And finally, free.

FADE OUT.
