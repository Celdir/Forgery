I can't be choosy.

As clean as my conscience.

various pink, yellow

and white forms)

No.

CUT TO:

5.

CUT TO:

TRAVIS (V.O.)

(monotone)

April 10, 1972. Thank God for the

rain which has helped wash the

garbage and trash off the sidewalks.

6.

TRAVIS (V.O.)

I'm working a single now, which

means stretch-shifts, six to six,

sometimes six to eight in the a.m.,

six days a week.

TRAVIS (V.O.)

It's a hustle, but it keeps me busy.

I can take in three to three-fifty

a week, more with skims.

MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT

(urgent)

Is Kennedy operating, cabbie? Is it

grounded?

TRAVIS

Why should it be grounded?

MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT

Listen - I mean I just saw the

needle of the Empire State Building.

You can't see it for the fog!

TRAVIS

Then it's a good guess it's grounded.

MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT

The Empire State in fog means

something, don't it? Do you know,

or don't you? What is your number,

cabbie?

TRAVIS

Have you tried the telephone?

MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT

(hostile, impatient)

There isn't time for that. In other

words, you don't know.

TRAVIS

No.

7.

MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT

Well, you should know, damn it, or

who else would know? Pull over

right here.

(points out window)

Why don't you stick your goddamn

head out of the goddamn window once

in a while and find out about the

goddamn fog!

MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT

Taxi! Taxi!

TRAVIS (V.O.)

I work the whole city, up, down,

don't make no difference to me -

does to some.

TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)

Some won't take spooks - Hell,

don't make no difference tom me.

JOHN (O.S.)

Oh baby, baby.

PROSTITUTE (O.S.)

(forceful)

Come on.

8.

CUT TO:

TRAVIS (V.O.)

They're all animals anyway. All the

animals come out at night: Whores,

skunk pussies, buggers, queens,

fairies, dopers, junkies, sick,

venal.

(a beat)

Someday a real rain will come and

wash all this scum off the streets.

TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)

Each night when I return the cab to

the garage I have to clean the come

off the back seat. Some nights I

clean off the blood.

taking a piss into

the hood)

CONCESSION GIRL

CONCESSION GIRL

Awh, come off it, Pal.

TRAVIS

No, I'm serious, really...

CONCESSION GIRL

Ya want me to call da boss? Huh?

That what you want?

CONCESSION GIRL

No, no, it's alright. I'll have a

big Coca-Cola - without ice - and a

large buttered popcorn, and...

(pointing)

... some of them chocolate covered

malted milk balls... and ju-jukes,

a box. They last.

CONCESSION GIRL

We don't have ju-jukes. We don't

have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal

Crown Cola.

TRAVIS

That's fine.

CONCESSION GIRL

That's a dollar forty-seven.

MALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.)

Come here, bitch. I'm gonna split

you in half.

12.

TRAVIS (V.O.)

Twelve hours of work and I still

cannot sleep. The days dwindle on

forever and do not end.

FADE TO:

BETSY

Tom.

13.

BETSY

Tom, come here a moment.

(he walks over)

I think this canvas report is about

ready to go out. Check it out with

Andy, and if he okays if, have a

copy made for the campaign

headquarters in every county.

(a beat)

And don't forget to add the new

photo releases.

TOM

The senator's white paper is almost

ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?

BETSY

Andy usually just sends those to

the national media. The local press

doesn't know what to do with a

position paper until UPI and AP

tell them anyway.

TOM

I think we should try to get

maximum coverage for this new

mandatory welfare program. Push the

issues.

BETSY

(as if instructing a child)

First push the man, then the issue.

Senator Palantine is first of all a

dynamic man, an intelligent,

interesting, fascinating man.

TOM

You forgot "sexy".

BETSY

No, I didn't forget "sexy".

TOM

Just didn't get around to it, huh?

BETSY

Oh, Tom, please.

14.

TOM

Well, for Christsakes, you sound

like you're selling... I don't know

what... cars... not issues.

BETSY

Have you ever wondered why CBS News

has the highest ratings?

TOM

More people watch it.

BETSY

Alright, forget it if you're not

going to be serious,

TOM

No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was

just...

BETSY

Just what?

TOM

Kidding around... you know, fun.

BETSY

Maybe if you'd try thinking once in

a while, you'd get somewhere.

TOM

With who?

BETSY

Alright, now. You want to know why

CBS has the highest ratings? You

their news is any different from

NBC, ABC? It's all the same news.

Same stories. Same order usually.

What, you thought they had good

news for people, right? You thought

that's why people watched CBS? I'll

tell you why people watch CBS.

Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not

the news, not the issues, the man.

If Walter Cronkite told people to

eat soap, they'd do it. We are

selling cars, goddamn it.

15.

TOM

Well, if Cronkite's so great, why

don't we run him instead?

BETSY

That's the last. The finish. Period.

Some pople can learn. Some people

can't. And you wonder why we never

get serious----

TOM

Sure we could run him. You realize

he's already of his block

association.

BETSY

(looks across street again)

Have you been noticing anything

strange?

TOM

No, why?

BETSY

Why's that taxi driver across the

street been staring at us?

TOM

What taxi driver?

BETSY

That taxi driver. The one that's

been sitting here.

TOM

How long has he been there?

BETSY

I don't know - but it feels like a

long time.

TOM

(determined)

Well, I'll go out and ask him.

16.

CUT TO:

TRAVIS (V.O.)

All my life needed was a sense of

direction, a sense of someplace to

go. I do not believe one should

devote his life to morbid self-

attention, but should become a

person like other people.

TRAVIS (V.O.)

I first saw her at Palantine

Campaign Headquarters at 58th and

Broadway. She was wearing a yellow

dress, answering the phone at her

desk.

17.

TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)

She appeared like an angel out of

this open sewer. Out of this filthy

mass. She is alone: They cannot

touch her.

CUT TO:

WIZARD

First she did her make-up. You

know, I hate it when they do that.

I mean she does the whole works,

the mascara, the eye-shadow, the

lipstick, the rouge...

18.

DOUGH-BOY

Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.

WIZARD

The kind with a brush.

WIZARD

Travis.

TRAVIS

Hey Wizard.

DOUGH-BOY

Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses

it,

WIZARD

(ironic)

Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.

WIZARD

(continuing)

Well, whatever the fuck it is, she

used it. And then the spray perfume.

You know, the real sweat kind -

and, on top of that, get this,

right when we're crossing the Tri-

boro bridge - she changes her

pantyhose!

DOUGH-BOY

No.

WIZARD

Yeah.

DOUGH-BOY

Could you see anything?

19.

WIZARD

Well, she was trying to keep her

skirt down, sort of, you know. But

it was pretty obvious what she was

doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush

hour and the traffic's practically

standing still.

DOUGH-BOY

What did you do?

WIZARD

Threw on the emergency, jumped the

seat and fucked her brains out -

What do you think!

(they laugh)

What do I have to do? Draw you a

picture?

DOUGH-BOY

Yeah.

WIZARD

What was I supposed to do? I was

watching in the rear view. You

know, just checkin' traffic.

(to Travis)

So howsit?

TRAVIS

(w/o inflection)

Some fleet driver for Bell just cut

up. Just heard it on the radio.

DOUGH-BOY

Stick up?

WIZARD

Sure. What do you think? She wanted

to get out of the cab. I said

"Look, you're in the middle of the

fucking bridge..."

DOUGH-BOY

You said that?

WIZARD

Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're

on a bridge..."

20.

DOUGH-BOY

And what happened?

WIZARD

She stayed in the cab, what's she

gonna do? but she stiffed me. A

real skunk.

DOUGH-BOY

A real skunk.

WIZARD

(paternal)

Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie

T.?

DOUGH-BOY

Yeah. We went to Harvard together.

(laughs)

WIZARD

We call him Dough-Boy cause he

likes the dollars. He'll chase a

buck straight into Jersey.

DOUGH-BOY

Look who's talking?

(gestures around table)

Who else would stay up all night to

catch the morning rush hour?

WIZARD

(to Travis)

So howsit?

TRAVIS

(w/o inflection)

Some fleet driver for Bell just got

cut up.  Just heard it on the radio.

DOUGH-BOY

Stick up?

21.

TRAVIS

No, just some crazy fucker. Cut

have his ear off.

DOUGH-BOY

Where.

TRAVIS

In the jungle. 122nd.

DOUGH-BOY

(changing the subject)

You run all over town, don't you,

Travis?

WIZARD

(referring to 122nd St.)

Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what

it is.

TRAVIS

Huh?

DOUGH-BOY

I mean, you handle some pretty

rough traffic, huh?

TRAVIS

(catching on)

I have.

DOUGH-BOY

You carry a piece? You need one?

TRAVIS

Nah.

(a beat)

I suppose not.

22.

DOUGH-BOY

Well, you ever need one, I know a

feller that kin getcha a real nice

deal. Lotsa shit around.

WIZARD

The cops and company raise hell

they find out.

DOUGH-BOY

Truck drivers bring up Harlem

Specials that blow up in your hand.

But this guy don't deal no shit.

Just quality. If you ever need

anything, I can put you in touch.

WIZARD

For a fee.

DOUGH-BOY

For a fee.

WIZARD

I never use mine. But it's a good

thing to have. Just as a threat.

DOUGH-BOY

(getting up)

well, if there's this many hackies

inside, there must be lots of hares

outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.

WIZARD

What ya gonna do with all that

money, Dough-Boy?

DOUGH-BOY

Support my kids. Can you dig it?

(pause)

nice to meet ya, Travis. So long,

Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for

me.

(nods to Charlie T.)

23.

CUT TO:

BETSY

Try holding the match like this.

TOM

This is gotta be a game, right?

BETSY

(putting on glasses)

This I gotta see.

TOM

(burning fingers)

Ouch!

BETSY

(giggling)

Oh, are you all right?

TOM

I'm great. Always set my fingers on

fire. If you want to see another

trick. I do this thing with my nose.

BETSY

No. I just wanted to see if you

could light it that way. The guy at

the newsstand can.

TOM

Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand,

Mr. Asbestos...

BETSY

He happens to be missing fingers. I

first noticed when -

24.

TOM

Is he Italian?

BETSY

No, why?

TOM

You sure he's not Italian?

BETSY

He's Black, OK?

TOM

Well, If he had been Italian, they

could have been shot off. Sometimes

the mob does that to teach guys a

lesson, If they blow a job or

something.

BETSY

As I said, he isn't Italian.

Besides, I thought they just killed

them.

TOM

Don't be naive. They can't kill

everybody. They have different

punishments for different things.

Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon,

they leave a canary on the body.

It's symbolic.

BETSY

Why don't they leave a pidgeon

instead of a canary?

TOM

I don't know. Maybe they don't

leave a canary. Don't be technical.

What I'm saying is if this newsstand

guy's Italian and his fingers are

gone, maybe he's a thief.

BETSY

First, he's not Italian. Second

he's not a thief. I noticed the

fingers when he was getting my

change - the right change. Two of

his fingers are missing. Just stubs.

Like they were blown away. I was

putting my change in my purse when

I saw him get out a cigarette. I

couldn't help watching. I was dying

to see how he'd light it.

25.

TOM

With the other hand, right?

BETSY

No, stupid. With the stubs. That's

the whole point.

TOM

I know that guy. His hand looks

like a paw. An old Black guy, the

newsstand at -

BETSY

No, this is young - well, I'm never

sure how old Black people are -

but, anyway, he isn't old. That's

for sure.

TOM

Show me how he did that again.

TRAVIS

(at Betsy's desk)

I want to volunteer.

TOM

(at Betsy's desk)

If you'll come this way.

26.

TRAVIS

(to Betsy)

No. I want to volunteer to you.

TOM

(under his voice)

Bets.

BETSY

(curious)

And why is that?

TRAVIS

Because you are the most beautiful

woman I have ever seen.

BETSY

(smiling)

Is that so?

(pause)

But what do you think of Charles

Palantine?

TRAVIS

(his mind elsewhere)

Who mam?

BETSY

Charles Palantine. The man you want

to volunteer to help elect president.

TRAVIS

Oh, I think he's a wonderful man.

Make a great, great President.

BETSY

You want to canvass?

TRAVIS

Yes, mam.

27.

BETSY

How do you feel about Senator

Palantine's stand on welfare?

TRAVIS

Welfare, mam? I think the Senator's

right. People should work for a

living. I do. I like to work. Every

day. Get those old coots off

welfare and make 'em work for a

change.

BETSY

Well, that's not exactly what the

Senator has proposed. You might not

want to canvass, but there is

plenty more other work we need

done: Office work, filing, poster

hanging.

TRAVIS

I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a

real good worker.

BETSY

(gesturing)

if you talk to Tom, he'll assign

you to something.

TRAVIS

If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather

work for you.

BETSY

Well, we're all working tonight.

TRAVIS

Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at

night.

28.

BETSY

Well, then, what is it you exactly

want to do?

TRAVIS

(bolstering courage)

If you don't mind, mam, I'd be

mighty pleased if you'd go out and

have some coffee and pie with me.

BETSY

Why?

TRAVIS

Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this

place here in my taxi many times a

day. And I watch you sitting here

at this big long desk with these

telephones, and I say to myself,

that's a lonely girl. She needs a

friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.

(smiles)

BETSY

I don't know...

TRAVIS

It's just to the corner, mam. In

broad daytime. Nothing can happen.

I'll be there to protect you.

BETSY

(smiles)

All right.

(relents)

All right. I'm taking a break at

four o'clock. If you're here then

we'll go to the corner and have

some coffee and pie.

TRAVIS

Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam.

I'll be here at four o'clock

exactly.

(pause)

And... ah... Betsy...

29.

BETSY

Yes?

TRAVIS

My name is Travis.

BETSY

Thank you, Travis.

BETSY

I'm just going to find out what the

cabbies are thinking.

CUT TO:

TRAVIS (V.O.)

April 26, 1972. Four o'clock p.m. I

took Betsy to the Mayfair Coffee

Shop on Broadway...

TRAVIS (V.O.)

I had black coffee and apple pie

with a slice of melted yellow

cheese.  I think that was a good

selection. Betsy had coffee and a

fruit salad dish. She could have

had anything she wanted.

30.

BETSY

We've signed up 15.000 Palantine

volunteers in New York so far. The

organizational problems are becoming

just staggering.

TRAVIS

I know what you mean. I've got the

same problems. I just can't get

things organized. Little things, I

mean. Like my room, my possessions.

I should get one of those signs

that says, "One of these days I'm

Gonna Organezizied".

BETSY

(laughing)

Travis, I never ever met anybody

like you before.

TRAVIS

I can believe that.

BETSY

Where do you live?

TRAVIS

(evasive)

Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint.

It ain't much.

BETSY

So why did you decide to drive a

taxi at night?

TRAVIS

I had a regular job for a while,

days. You know, doin' this, doin'

that. But I didn't have anything to

do at night. I got kinda lonely,

you know, just wandering around. So

I decided to works nights. It ain't

good to be alone, you know.

BETSY

After this job, I'm looking forward

to being alone for a while.

31.

TRAVIS

Yeah, well...

(a beat)

In a cab you get to meet people.

You meet lotsa people. It's good

for you.

BETSY

What kind of people?

TRAVIS

Just people people, you know. Just

people.

(a beat)

Had a dead man once.

BETSY

Really?

TRAVIS

He'd been shot. I didn't know that.

He just crawled into the back seat,

said "West 45th Street" and conked

out.

BETSY

What did you do?

TRAVIS

I shot the meter off, for one thing.

I knew I wasn't goimg to get paid.

Then I dropped him off at the cop

shop. They took him.

BETSY

That's really something.

TRAVIS

Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in

a cab. Especially when the moon's

out.

BETSY

The moon?

TRAVIS

The full moon. One night I had

three or four weirdoes in a row and

I looked up and, sure enough, there

it was - the full moon.

32.

TRAVIS

Oh, yeah. People will do anything

in front of a taxi driver. I mean

anything. People too cheap to rent

a hotel room, people scoring dope,

people shooting up, people who want

to embarrass you.

(a bitterness emerges)

It's like you're not even there,

not even a person. Nobody knows you.

BETSY

Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad.

I take lots of taxis.

TRAVIS

I know. I could have picked you up.

BETSY

Huh?

TRAVIS

Late one night. About three. At the

plaza.

BETSY

Three in the morning? I don't think

so. I have to go to bed early. I

work days. It must have been

somebody else.

TRAVIS

No. It was you. You had some manila

folders and a pink bag from Saks.

BETSY

You're right! Now I remember! It

was after the Western regional

planners were in town and the

meeting went late. The next day I

was completely bushed. It was

unbelievable.

TRAVIS

If it wasn't for a drunk I would

have picked you up. He wanted to go

to the DMZ.

33.

BETSY

The DMZ?

TRAVIS

South Bronx. The worst. I tried to

ditch him, but he was already in

the cab, so I had to take him.

That's the law. Otherwise I would

have picked you up.

BETSY

That would have been quite a

coincidence.

TRAVIS

You'd be surprised how often you

see the same people, get the same

fare. People have patterns. They do

more or less the same things every

day. I can tell.

BETSY

Well, I don't go to the Plaza every

night.

TRAVIS

I didn't mean you. But just ordinary

people. A guy I know - Dough-Boy -

met his wife that way. They got to

talking. She said she usually

caught the bus so he started

picking her up at the bus stop,

taking her home with the flag up.

BETSY

That's very romantic. Some of your

fares must be interesting. See any

stars, politicians, deliver any

babies yet?

TRAVIS

Well, no... not really... had some

famous people in the cab.

(remembering)

I got this guy who makes lasers.

Not regular lasers, not the big

kind. Little lasers, pocket sized,

small enough to clip your belt like

a transistor radio, like a gun, you

know. Like a ray gun. Zap.

BETSY

(laughs)

What hours do you work?

34.

TRAVIS

I work a single, which means

there's no replacement - no second

man on the cab. Six to six,

sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours

a week.

BETSY

(amazed)

You mean you work seventy-two hours

a week.

TRAVIS

Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I

squeeze a few more hours in the

morning. Eighty miles a day, a

hundred miles a night.

BETSY

You must be rich.

TRAVIS

(big affectionate smile)

it keeps ya busy.

BETSY

You know what you remind me of?

TRAVIS

What?

BETSY

That song by Kris Kristofferson,

where it's said "Like a pusher,

party truth, partly ficition, a

walking contradiction".

(smiles)

TRAVIS

I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I

never have pushed.

TRAVIS

I didn't mean that, Travis. Just

the part about the contradiction.

TRAVIS

(more at ease)

Oh. Who was that again?

BETSY

The singer?

35.

TRAVIS

Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too

much.

BETSY

(slowly)

Kris Kristofferson.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

36.

TRAVIS (V.O.)

You work at night, you get an

instinct. You can smell them. The

big tippers, the stiffs, the

trouble makers. Quarter is good tip

for Manhattan. Queens is better,

Brooklyn is best. go for the guys

with suitcases. The rich are the

worst tippers, hooks are lousy.

Spooks are okay, but they don't

live at Park Ave after all.

37.

TRAVIS (V.O.)

I called Betsy again at her office,

and she said maybe we could go to a

movie together after she gets off

work tomorrow. That's my day off.

At first she hesitated, but I

called her again and she agreed.

(pause)

Betsy. Betsy what? I forgot to ask

her last name again.  Damn. I've

got to remember stuff like that.

MAN'S VOICE

St. Regis Hotel.

TOM

It's 12:30 now. You'll have fifteen

minutes before the actual luncheon

begins.

ASSISTANT

I don't think we have to worry

about anybody here committing

themselves until things start

TRAVIS

(interrupting)

Say, aren't you Charles Palantine,

the candidate?

PALANTINE

(only mildly irritated)

Yes I am.

38.

TRAVIS

Well, I'm one of your biggest

supporters. I tell everybody that

comes in this cab that they should

vote for you.

PALANTINE

(pleased; glances to

check Travis' license)

Why, thank you Travis.

TRAVIS

I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody

I know is going to vote for you.

(a beat)

I was going to put one of your

stickers on my taxi but the company

said it was against their policy.

PALANTINE

(pleasant)

I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned

more about this country sitting in

taxi cabs than in the board room of

General Motors.

TOM

(joking)

And in some other places too...

PALANTINE

Travis, what single thing would you

want the next President of this

country to do most?

TRAVIS

I don't know, sir. I don't follow

political issues much.

PALANTINE

There must be something...

TRAVIS

(thinks)

Well, he should clean up this city

here. It's full of filth and scum.

Scum and filth. It's like an open

sewer. I can hardly take it.

(MORE)

39.

TRAVIS (CONT'D)

Some days I go out and smell it

then I get headaches that just stay

and never go away. We need a

President that would clean up this

whole mess.  Flush it out.

PALANTINE

(after a pause)

I know what you mean, Travis, and

it's not going to be easy. We're

going to have to make some radical

changes.

TRAVIS

(turning the wheel)

Damn straight.

PALANTINE

Nice talking to you, Travis.

TRAVIS

(calling back)

Thank you, sir. You're a good man,

sir.

BETSY

You didn't have to spend your

money - ?

TRAVIS

(interrupting)

He'll, what else can I do with it

all?

BETSY

Travis, you haven't even played the

record?

TRAVIS

(evasive)

Yeah, well my stereo player is

broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.

BETSY

Your stereo broke? God, I could

hardly stand that. I live on music.

41.

TRAVIS

I don't follow music much. I'd like

to though.

(second thought)

Honest.

BETSY

(pointing to album)

So you haven't heard this record yet?

TRAVIS

No.

(sly smile)

I thought maybe you could play it

for me on your player.

BETSY

What are you doing?

TRAVIS

(innocent)

I bought a couple of tickets.

BETSY

But this is a porno movie.

TRAVIS

No, these are the kind that couples

go to. They're not like the other

movies. All kinds of couples go.

Honest. I've seen them.

42.

TRAVIS

(to himself)

Damn.

BETSY

What's wrong?

TRAVIS

I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.

43.

TRAVIS

Where are you going?

BETSY

I'm leaving.

TRAVIS

What do you mean?

BETSY

These are not the kind of movies I

go to.

TRAVIS

Well, I don't follow movies too

much...

BETSY

You mean these are the only kind of

movies you go to?

TRAVIS

This is sort of high class...

BETSY

I mean porno movies.

TRAVIS

(hesitant)

Well... mostly...

BETSY

My God!

TRAVIS

We can go to another movie if you

like, I don't care. I got money.

There's plenty...

BETSY

If you just wanted to fuck, why

didn't you just come right out and

say it?

44.

TRAVIS

... there's plenty of movies around

here. I haven't seen any of them,

but I'm sure they're good.

BETSY

No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and

all that, but I think this is it.

I'm going home.

TRAVIS

(interrupting)

You mean you don't want to go to a

movie?

(a beat)

There's plenty of movies around here.

BETSY

No, I don't feel so good. We're

just two very different kinds of

people, that's all.

TRAVIS

(puzzled)

Huh?

BETSY

It's very simple. You go your way,

I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.

TRAVIS

But... Betsy...

BETSY

I'm getting a taxi.

TRAVIS

(following her)

What about the record?

BETSY

Keep it.

TRAVIS

Can I call you?

45.

TRAVIS

(tender)

Please, Betsy, I bought it for you.

BETSY

All right, I'll accept the record.

BETSY

Taxi!

I tried to call her several times.

TRAVIS

didn't feel so good...

TRAVIS (V.O.)

But after the first call, she would

no longer come to the phone.

47.

TRAVIS (V.O.)

I also sent flowers with no luck. I

should not dwell on such things,

but set them behind me. The smell

of the flowers only made me sicker.

The headaches got worse I think

I've got stomach cancer. I should

not complain so. "You're only as

healthy as you feel."

TRAVIS (V.O.)

I realize now how much she is like

Many people are like that. They're

YOUNG PASSENGER

Huh?

(a beat)

What do you think of that, huh?

YOUNG PASSENGER

I'm gonna kill her with a .44

Magnum pistol.

YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)

Did you ever see what a .44 can do

to a woman's face, cabbie?

(pause)

Did you ever see what it can do to

a woman's pussy, cabbie?

YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)

I'm going to put it right up to

Hey Travis. This here's Easy Andy.

This is fine, Dough-Boy

Pay Dough-Boy here.

TRAVIS

20 bucks?

DOUGH-BOY

(takes bill)

Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice,

Travis.

ANDY

Dough-Boy probably told you I don't

carry any Saturday Night Specials

or crap like that. It's all out of

State, clean, brand new, top-of-

the-line stuff.

52.

TRAVIS

You got a .44 Magnum?

ANDY

That's an expensive gun.

TRAVIS

I got money.

ANDY

(admiringly)

It's a monster. Can stop a car --

put a bullet right into the block.

A premium high resale gun. $350 --

that's only a hundred over list.

ANDY

I could sell this gun in Harlem for

$500 today - but I just deal high

quality goods to high quality

people.

(pause)

Now this may be a little big for

practical use, in which case I'd

recommend the .38 Smith and Wesson

Special. Fine solid gun - nickel

plated. Snub-nosed, otherwise the

same as the service revolver. Now

that'll stop anything that moves

and it's handy, flexible.

(MORE)

53.

ANDY (CONT'D)

The Magnum, you know, that's only

if you want to splatter it against

the wall. The movies have driven up

the price of the Magnum anyway.

Everybody wants them now. But the

Wesson .38 - only $250 - and worth

every dime of it.

(he hefts the .38)

Throw in a holster for $10.

ANDY (CONT'D)

Some of these guns are like toys,

but a Smith and Wesson, man, you

can hit somebody over the head with

it and it will still come back dead

on.  Nothing beats quality.

(pause)

You interested in an automatic?

TRAVIS

I want a .32.   Revolver. And a

palm gun. That .22 there.

ANDY

That's the Colt .25 - a fine little

gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but

it's as fast as the Devil. Handy

little gun, you can carry it almost

anywhere. I'll throw it in for

another $125.

TRAVIS

How much for everything.

ANDY

The .32's $150 - and you're really

getting a good deal now - and all

together it comes to, ah, seven

eighty-five for four pieces and a

holster. He'll, I'll give you the

holster, we'll make it seventy-five

and you've got a deal - a good one.

TRAVIS

How much to get a permit to carry?

54.

ANDY

Well, you're talking big money now.

I'd say at least five grand, maybe

more, and it would take a while to

check it out. The way things are

going now $5.000 is probably low.

You see, I try not to fool with the

small-time crap. Too risky, too

little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I

get the permit it'll be as solid as

the Empire State Building.

TRAVIS

Nah, this'll be fine.

ANDY

You can't carry in a cab even with

a permit - so why bother?

TRAVIS

Is there a firing range around?

ANDY

Sure, here, take this card, go to

this place and give 'em the card.

They'll charge you, but there won't

be any hassle.

ANDY

You in Nam? Can't help but notice

your jacket?

TRAVIS

(looking up)

Huh?

ANDY

Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket.

Where were you? Bet you got to

handle a lot of weapons out there.

TRAVIS

Yeah. I was all around. One

hospital, then the next.

55.

ANDY

(through counting)

It's he'll out there all right. A

real shit-eatin' war. I'll say

this, though: It's bringing a lot

of fantastic guns. The market's

flooded. Colt automatics are all

over.

(pockets the money)

TRAVIS

(intensely)

They'd never get me to go back.

They'd have to shoot me first.

(pause)

You got anything to carry these in?

(gestures to pistols)

ANDY

Sure.

ANDY

You like ball games?

TRAVIS

Huh?

ANDY

I can get you front and center.

What do you like? I can get you

Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can

get you the Mayor's box.

TRAVIS

Nah. I ain't interested.

Okay, okay.

Still don't own my own cab.  I

guess that's the way I want it.

You see, that must be what I am.

Look, a person does a certain thing

and that's all there is to it.  It

becomes what he is.  Why fight it?

What do you know?  How long you

You're like a peg and you get

dropped into a slot and you got to

squirm and wiggle around a while

I don't remember.

TRAVIS

It don't matter.  I'm gonna get you

outta here.

(looks toward door)

IRIS

We better make it, or Sport'll get

mad.  How do you want to make it?

TRAVIS

(pressured)

I don't want to make it.  I came

here to get you out.

IRIS

You want to make it like this?

(goes for his fly)

TRAVIS

(taking her by the shoulders)

Can't you listen to me?  Don't you

want to get out of here?

IRIS

Why should I want to get out of

here?  This is where I live.

TRAVIS

(exasperated)

But you're the one that wanted to

get away.  You're the one that came

into my cab.

IRIS

I musta been stoned.

TRAVIS

Do they drug you?

85.

IRIS

(reproving)

Oh, come off it, man.

TRAVIS

Listen...

IRIS

Don't you want to make it?

(a beat)

Can't you make it?

TRAVIS

(distraught)

I want to help you.

IRIS

(catching on)

You can't make it, can you?

(a beat)

I can help you.

TRAVIS

Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck

it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!

IRIS

(confused)

You can do it in my mouth.

TRAVIS

Don't you understand anything?

86.

IRIS

You don't have to make it, mister.

TRAVIS

(slowly)

Do you understand why I came here?

IRIS

I think so.  I tried to get into

your cab one night, and now you

want to come and take me away.

TRAVIS

Don't you want to go?

IRIS

I can leave anytime I want.

TRAVIS

But that one night?

IRIS

I was stoned.  That's why they

stopped me.  When I'm not stoned, I

got no place else to go.  They just

protect me from myself.

TRAVIS

Well, I tried.

IRIS

(compassionate)

I understand, mister.  It means

something, really.

TRAVIS

(getting up)

Can I see you again?

IRIS

That's not hard to do.

TRAVIS

No, I mean really.  This is nothing

for a person to do.

87.

IRIS

Sure.  All right.  We'll have

breakfast.  I get up about one

o'clock.  Tomorrow.

TRAVIS

(thinking)

Well tomorrow noon there's a... I

got a...

IRIS

Well, you want to or not?

TRAVIS

(deciding)

O.K. It's a date.  I'll see you

here, then.

TOM

Oh, Iris?

IRIS

Yes?

TOM

My name's Travis.

IRIS

Thank you, Travis.

TRAVIS

So long, Iris.

Sweet Iris.

OLD MAN

(holding gun)

I think this is yours, cowboy.

TRAVIS

Here's the twenty bucks, old man.

You better damn well spend it right.

OLD MAN

Come back anytime you want, cowboy.

But without the rod -- please.

Where is home?

IRIS

I got so many sunglasses.  I

couldn't live without my shades,

man.  I must have twelve pair of

shades.

TRAVIS

Where?

IRIS

Pittsburgh.

TRAVIS

I ain't ever been there, but it

don't seem like such a bad place.

IRIS

(voice rising)

Why do you want me to go back to my

parents?  They hate me.  Why do you

think I split?  There ain't nothin

there.

TRAVIS

But you can't live like this.  It's

hell.  Girls should live at home.

IRIS

(playfully)

Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?

91.

TRAVIS

(ignoring her question)

Young girls are supposed to dress

up, go to school, play with boys,

you know, that kinda stuff.

IRIS

God, you are square.

TRAVIS

(releasing pent-up tension)

At least I don't walk the streets

like a skunk pussy.  I don't screw

and fuck with killers and junkies.

IRIS

Who's a killer?

TRAVIS

That fella "Sport" looks like a

killer to me.

IRIS

He never killed nobody.  He's a

Libra.

TRAVIS

Huh?

IRIS

I'm a Libra too.  That's why we get

along so well.

TRAVIS

He looks like a killer.

IRIS

I think Cancer's make the best

lovers.  My whole family are air

signs.

TRAVIS

He shoots dope too.

IRIS

What makes you so high and mighty?

Did you ever look at your own

eyeballs in a mirror.  You don't

get eyes like that from...

92.

TRAVIS

He's worse than an animal.  Jail's

too good for scum like that.

IRIS

Rock music died in 1970, that's

what I think.  Before that it was

fantastic.  I can tell you that.

Everybody was crashing, hanging out

at the Fillmore.  Me and my

girlfriend Ann used to go up the

fire escape, you know?  It was

unbelievable.  Rock Stars everywhere.

That Airplane--that's my group, man.

All Libras.  But now everybody's

split or got sick or busted.  I

think I'll move to one of those

communes in Vermont, you know?

That's where all the smart ones

went.  I stayed here.

TRAVIS

I never been to a commune.  I don't

know.  I saw pictures in a magazine,

and it didn't look very clean to me.

IRIS

Why don't you come to a commune

with me?

TRAVIS

Me?  I could never go to a place

like that.

IRIS

Why not?

TRAVIS

(hesitant)

I... I don't get along with people

like that.

IRIS

You a scorpion?  That's it.  You're

a scorpion.  I can tell.

TRAVIS

Besides, I've got to stay here.

93.

IRIS

Why?

TRAVIS

I've got something important to do.

I can't leave.

IRIS

What's so important?

TRAVIS

I can't say -- it's top secret.

I'm doing something for the Army.

The cab thing is just part time.

IRIS

You a narc?

TRAVIS

Do I look like a narc?

IRIS

Yeah.

IRIS

God, I don't know who's weirder,

you or me.

TRAVIS

(pause)

What are you going to do about

Sport and that old bastard?

IRIS

Just leave'em.  There's plenty of

other girls.

TRAVIS

You just gonna leave 'em?

IRIS

(astonished)

What should I do?  Call the cops?

TRAVIS

Cops don't do nothin.

IRIS

Sport never treated me bad, honest.

Never beat me up once.

94.

TRAVIS

You can't leave 'em to do the same

to other girls.  You should get rid

of them.

IRIS

How?

TRAVIS

(shrugs)

I don't know.  Just should, though.

(a beat)

Somebody should kill 'em.  Nobody'd

miss 'em.

IRIS

(taken back)

God.  I know where they should have

a commune for you.  They should

have a commune for you at Bellevue.

TRAVIS

(apologetic/sheepish)

I'm sorry, Iris.  I didn't mean that.

IRIS

You're not much with girls, are you?

TRAVIS

(thinks)

Well, Iris, I look at it this way.

A lot of girls come into my cab,

some of them very beautiful.  And I

figure all day long men have been

after them: trying to touch them,

talk to them, ask them out.  And

they hate it.  So I figure the best

I can do for them is not bother

them at all.  So I don't say a

thing.  I pretend I'm not even

there.  I figure they'll understand

that and appreciate me for it.

IRIS

Do you really think I should go to

the commune?

95.

TRAVIS

I think you should go home, but

otherwise I think you should go.

It would be great for you.  You

have to get away from here.  The

city's a sewer, you gotta get out

of it.

IRIS

Sure you don't want to come with me?

TRAVIS

I can't.  Otherwise, I would.

IRIS

I sure hate to go alone...

TRAVIS

I'll give you the money to go.  I

don't want you to take any from

those guys.

IRIS

You don't have to.

TRAVIS

I want to -- what else can I do

with my money?

(thinks)

You may not see me again--for a

while.

IRIS

What do you mean?

TRAVIS

My work may take me out of New York.

SPORT

What's the matter, baby, don't you

feel right?

IRIS

It's my stomach.  I got the flu.

SPORT

Oh, baby, there ain't no flu.  You

know that, baby.

IRIS

Honest, Sport.

SPORT

You're just tired, baby.  You just

need your man.  I am your man, you

know.  You are my woman.  I wouldn't

be nothing without you.

SPORT

I know this may not mean anything

to you, baby, but sometimes I get

so emotional, sometimes I think, I

wish every man could have what I

have now, that every woman could be

loved the way I love you.  I go

home and I think what it would be

without you, and then I thank God

for you.  I think to myself, man,

you are so lucky.  You got a woman

who loves you, who needs you, a

woman who keeps you strong.  It's

just you and me.  I'm nothing

without you.  I can go like this

for ever and ever.  We can do it,

baby.  You and me.  Just you and me.

IRIS' FATHER (V.O.)

Dear Mr. Bickle,

I can't say how happy Mrs. Steensma

and I were to hear that you are

well and recuperating.  We tried to

visit you at the hospital when we

were in New York to pick up Iris,

but you were still in a coma.

There is no way we can repay you

for returning our Iris to us.  We

thought we had lost her, but now

our lives are full again.  Needless

to say, you are something of a hero

around this household.

I'm sure you want to know about

Iris.  She is back in school and

working hard.  The transition has

been very hard for her, as you can

well imagine, but we have taken

steps to see she never has cause to

run away again.

In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I

would like to again thank you from

the bottom of our hearts.

Unfortunately, we cannot afford to

come to New York again to thank you

in person, or we surely would.  But

if you should ever come to

Pittsburgh, you would find yourself

a most welcome guest in our home.

Our deepest thanks,

Burt and Ivy Steensma
