"PULP FICTION"

By

Quentin Tarantino & Roger Avary

YOUNG MAN

No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm

through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN

You always say that, the same thing

every time: never again, I'm through,

too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN

I know that's what I always say. I'm

always right too, but

YOUNG WOMAN

but you forget about it in a day

or two -

YOUNG MAN

yeah, well, the days of me

forgittin' are over, and the days of

me rememberin' have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN

When you go on like this, you know

what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN

I sound like a sensible fucking man,

is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN

You sound like a duck.

(imitates a duck)

Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,

quack, quack...

YOUNG MAN

Well take heart, 'cause you're never

gonna hafta hear it again. Because

since I'm never gonna do it again,

you're never gonna hafta hear me

quack about how I'm never gonna do

it again.

YOUNG WOMAN

After tonight.

YOUNG MAN

(with a smile)

Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

WAITRESS

Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

YOUNG WOMAN

Oh yes, thank you.

YOUNG MAN

I'm doin' fine.

YOUNG MAN

I mean the way it is now, you're

takin' the same fuckin' risk as when

you rob a bank. You take more of a

risk. Banks are easier!  Federal

banks aren't supposed to stop you

anyway, during a robbery. They're

insured, why should they care? You

don't even need a gun in a federal

bank. I heard about this guy, walked

into a federal bank with a portable

phone, handed the phone to the teller,

the guy on the other end of the phone

said: "We got this guy's little girl,

and if you don't give him all your

money, we're gonna kill 'er."

YOUNG WOMAN

Did it work?

YOUNG MAN

Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm

talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in

a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,

not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,

cleans the place out, and they don't

lift a fuckin' finger.

YOUNG WOMAN

Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN

I don't know. There probably never

was a little girl  the point of the

story isn't the little girl. The

point of the story is they robbed

the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN

You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN

I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,

I'm just illustrating that if we

did, it would be easier than what we

been doin'.

YOUNG WOMAN

So you don't want to be a bank robber?

YOUNG MAN

Naw, all those guys are goin' down

the same road, either dead or servin'

twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN

And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN

What have we been talking about?

Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,

it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too

many foreigners own liquor stores.

Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't

fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:

"Empty out the register," and they

don't know what it fuckin' means.

They make it too personal. We keep

on, one of those gook motherfuckers'

gonna make us kill 'em.

YOUNG WOMAN

I'm not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN

I don't wanna kill anybody either.

But they'll probably put us in a

situation where it's us of them. And

if it's not the gooks, it these old

Jews who've owned the store for

fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got

Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the

counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try

walkin' into one of those stores

with nothin' but a telephone, see

how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget

it, we're out of it.

YOUNG WOMAN

Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN

(laughing)

Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN

Well what then?

YOUNG MAN

Garcon! Coffee!

YOUNG MAN

This place.

WAITRESS

(snotty)

"Garcon" means boy.

YOUNG WOMAN

Here? It's a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN

What's wrong with that? People never

rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor

stores, gas stations, you get your

head blown off stickin' up one of

them. Restaurants, on the other hand,

you catch with their pants down.

They're not expecting to get robbed,

or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN

(taking to idea)

I bet in places like this you could

cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN

Correct. Just like banks, these places

are insured. The managers don't give

a fuck, they're just tryin' to get

ya out the door before you start

pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget

it, they ain't takin' a bullet for

the register. Busboys, some wetback

gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour

gonna really give a fuck you're

stealin' from the owner. Customers

are sittin' there with food in their

mouths, they don't know what's goin'

on. One minute they're havin' a Denver

omelet, next minute somebody's

stickin' a gun in their face.

YOUNG MAN

See, I got the idea last liquor store

we stuck up. 'Member all those

customers kept comin' in?

YOUNG WOMAN

Yeah.

YOUNG MAN

Then you got the idea to take

everybody's wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN

Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN

That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN

Thanks.

YOUNG MAN

We made more from the wallets then

we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN

Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN

A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN

A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN

Pretty smart, huh?

YOUNG WOMAN

Pretty smart.

(into it)

I'm ready, let's go, right here,

right now.

YOUNG MAN

Remember, same as before, you're

crowd control, I handle the employees.

YOUNG WOMAN

Got it.

YOUNG WOMAN

I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN

I love you, Honey Bunny.

PUMPKIN

(yelling to all)

Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY

Any of you fuckin' pricks move and

I'll execute every one of you

motherfuckers!  Got that?

JULES

Okay now, tell me about the hash

bars?

VINCENT

What so you want to know?

JULES

Well, hash is legal there, right?

VINCENT

Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a

hundred percent legal. I mean you

can't walk into a restaurant, roll a

joint, and start puffin' away. You're

only supposed to smoke in your home

or certain designated places.

JULES

Those are hash bars?

VINCENT

Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's

legal to buy it, it's legal to own

it and, if you're the proprietor of

a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

It's legal to carry it, which doesn't

really matter 'cause  get a load of

this  if the cops stop you, it's

illegal for this to search you.

Searching you is a right that the

cops in Amsterdam don't have.

JULES

That did it, man  I'm fuckin' goin',

that's all there is to it.

VINCENT

You'll dig it the most. But you know

what the funniest thing about Europe

is?

JULES

What?

VINCENT

It's the little differences. A lotta

the same shit we got here, they got

there, but there they're a little

different.

JULES

Examples?

VINCENT

Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer

in a movie theatre. And I don't mean

in a paper cup either. They give you

a glass of beer, like in a bar. In

Paris, you can buy beer at

MacDonald's. Also, you know what

they call a Quarter Pounder with

Cheese in Paris?

JULES

They don't call it a Quarter Pounder

with Cheese?

VINCENT

No, they got the metric system there,

they wouldn't know what the fuck a

Quarter Pounder is.

JULES

What'd they call it?

VINCENT

Royale with Cheese.

JULES

(repeating)

Royale with Cheese. What'd they call

a Big Mac?

VINCENT

Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call

it Le Big Mac.

JULES

Le Big Mac. What do they call a

Whopper?

VINCENT

I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger

King.  But you know what they put on

french fries in Holland instead of

ketchup?

JULES

What?

VINCENT

Mayonnaise.

JULES

Goddamn!

VINCENT

I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a

little bit on the side of the plate,

they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

JULES

Uuccch!

CUT TO:

JULES

We should have shotguns for this

kind of deal.

VINCENT

How many up there?

JULES

Three or four.

VINCENT

Counting our guy?

JULES

I'm not sure.

VINCENT

So there could be five guys up there?

JULES

It's possible.

VINCENT

We should have fuckin' shotguns.

CUT TO:

VINCENT

What's her name?

JULES

Mia.

VINCENT

How did Marsellus and her meet?

JULES

I dunno, however people meet people.

She usta be an actress.

VINCENT

She ever do anything I woulda saw?

JULES

I think her biggest deal was she

starred in a pilot.

VINCENT

What's a pilot?

JULES

Well, you know the shows on TV?

VINCENT

I don't watch TV.

JULES

Yes, but you're aware that there's

an invention called television, and

on that invention they show shows?

VINCENT

Yeah.

JULES

Well, the way they pick the shows on

TV is they make one show, and that

show's called a pilot. And they show

that one show to the people who pick

the shows, and on the strength of

that one show, they decide if they

want to make more shows. Some get

accepted and become TV programs, and

some don't, and become nothing. She

starred in one of the ones that became

nothing.

JULES

You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-

black, half-Samoan, usta call him

Tony Rocky Horror.

VINCENT

Yeah maybe, fat right?

JULES

I wouldn't go so far as to call the

brother fat. He's got a weight

problem.  What's the nigger gonna

do, he's Samoan.

VINCENT

I think I know who you mean, what

about him?

JULES

Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up

good.  And word around the campfire,

it was on account of Marsellus

Wallace's wife.

VINCENT

What'd he do, fuck her?

JULES

No no no no no no no, nothin' that

bad.

VINCENT

Well what then?

JULES

He gave her a foot massage.

VINCENT

A foot massage?

VINCENT

That's all?

VINCENT

What did Marsellus do?

JULES

Sent a couple of guys over to his

place.  They took him out on the

patio of his apartment, threw his

ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell

four stories. They had this garden

at the bottom, enclosed in glass,

like one of them greenhouses  nigger

fell through that. Since then, he's

kinda developed a speech impediment.

VINCENT

That's a damn shame.

VINCENT

Still I hafta say, play with matches,

ya get burned.

JULES

Whaddya mean?

VINCENT

You don't be givin' Marsellus

Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

JULES

You don't think he overreacted?

VINCENT

Antwan probably didn't expect

Marsellus to react like he did, but

he had to expect a reaction.

JULES

It was a foot massage, a foot massage

is nothing, I give my mother a foot

massage.

VINCENT

It's laying hands on Marsellus

Wallace's new wife in a familiar

way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out

no, but you're in the same fuckin'

ballpark.

JULES

Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right

there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'

a bitch a foot massage ain't even

the same fuckin' thing.

VINCENT

Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

JULES

It ain't no ballpark either. Look

maybe your method of massage differs

from mine, but touchin' his lady's

feet, and stickin' your tongue in

her holyiest of holyies, ain't the

same ballpark, ain't the same league,

ain't even the same fuckin' sport.

Foot massages don't mean shit.

VINCENT

Have you ever given a foot massage?

JULES

Don't be tellin' me about foot

massages  I'm the foot fuckin'

master.

VINCENT

Given a lot of 'em?

JULES

Shit yeah. I got my technique down

man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

VINCENT

Have you ever given a guy a foot

massage?

JULES

Fuck you.

VINCENT

How many?

JULES

Fuck you.

VINCENT

Would you give me a foot massage

I'm kinda tired.

JULES

Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'

pissed  this is the door.

JULES

What time is it?

VINCENT

(checking his watch)

Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

JULES

It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

JULES

Look, just because I wouldn't give

no man a foot massage, don't make it

right for Marsellus to throw Antwan

off a building into a glass-

motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the

way the nigger talks. That ain't

right, man. Motherfucker do that to

me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause

I'd kill'a motherfucker.

VINCENT

I'm not sayin' he was right, but

you're sayin' a foot massage don't

mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.

I've given a million ladies a million

foot massages and they all meant

somethin'. We act like they don't,

but they do. That's what's so fuckin'

cool about 'em. This sensual thing's

goin' on that nobody's talkin about,

but you know it and she knows it,

fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan

shoulda known fuckin' better. That's

his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna

have a sense of humor about that

shit.

JULES

That's an interesting point, but

let's get into character.

VINCENT

What's her name again?

JULES

Mia. Why you so interested in big

man's wife?

VINCENT

Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida

and when he's gone, he wants me to

take care of Mia.

JULES

Take care of her?

VINCENT

Not that! Take her out. Show her a

good time. Don't let her get lonely.

JULES

You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace

out on a date?

VINCENT

It ain't a date. It's like when you

and your buddy's wife go to a movie

or somethin'. It's just... you know...

good company.

VINCENT

It's not a date.

JULES

Hey kids.

JULES

How you boys doin'?

JULES

(to Brett)

Am I trippin', or did I just ask you

a question.

BRETT

We're doin' okay.

JULES

Do you know who we are?

JULES

We're associates of your business

partner Marsellus Wallace, you

remember your business partner

dont'ya?

JULES

(to Brett)

Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:

you're Brett, right?

BRETT

I'm Brett.

JULES

I thought so. Well, you remember

your business partner Marsellus

Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

BRETT

I remember him.

JULES

Good for you. Looks like me and

Vincent caught you at breakfast,

sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

BRETT

Hamburgers.

JULES

Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any

nutritious breakfast. What kinda

hamburgers?

BRETT

Cheeseburgers.

JULES

No, I mean where did you get'em?

MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-

Box, where?

BRETT

Big Kahuna Burger.

JULES

Big Kahuna Burger. That's that

Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they

got some tasty burgers. I ain't never

had one myself, how are they?

BRETT

They're good.

JULES

Mind if I try one of yours?

BRETT

No.

JULES

Yours is this one, right?

BRETT

Yeah.

JULES

Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.

(to Vincent)

Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna

Burger?

VINCENT

No.

JULES

You wanna bite, they're real good.

VINCENT

I ain't hungry.

JULES

Well, if you like hamburgers give

'em a try sometime. Me, I can't

usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's

a vegetarian. Which more or less

makes me a vegetarian, but I sure

love the taste of a good burger.

(to Brett)

You know what they call a Quarter

Pounder with Cheese in France?

BRETT

No.

JULES

Tell 'em, Vincent.

VINCENT

Royale with Cheese.

JULES

Royale with Cheese, you know why

they call it that?

BRETT

Because of the metric system?

JULES

Check out the big brain on Brett.

You'a smart motherfucker, that's

right. The metric system.

(he points to a fast

food drink cup)

What's in this?

BRETT

Sprite.

JULES

Sprite, good, mind if I have some of

your tasty beverage to wash this

down with?

BRETT

Sure.

JULES

Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!

(to Roger)

You, Flock of Seagulls, you know

what we're here for?

JULES

Then why don't you tell my boy here

Vince, where you got the shit hid.

MARVIN

It's under the be

JULES

I don't remember askin' you a

goddamn thing.

(to Roger)

You were sayin'?

ROGER

It's under the bed.

VINCENT

Got it.

JULES

We happy?

JULES

Vincent!

JULES

We happy?

VINCENT

We're happy.

BRETT

(to Jules)

Look, what's your name? I got his

name's Vincent, but what's yours?

JULES

My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'

your ass outta this shit.

BRETT

I just want you to know how sorry we

are about how fucked up things got

between us and Mr. Wallace. When we

entered into this thing, we only had

the best intentions

JULES

(to Brett)

Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your

concentration? I didn't mean to do

that.  Please, continue. I believe

you were saying something about "best

intentions."

JULES

Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through

anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would

you describe for me what Marsellus

Wallace looks like?

JULES

What country you from!

BRETT

(petrified)

What?

JULES

"What" ain't no country I know! Do

they speak English in "What?"

BRETT

(near heart attack)

What?

JULES

English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-

it?

BRETT

Yes.

JULES

Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

BRETT

Yes.

JULES

Now describe what Marsellus Wallace

looks like!

BRETT

(out of fear)

What?

JULES

Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What"

again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya

motherfucker, say "What" one more

goddamn time!

JULES

Now describe to me what Marsellus

Wallace looks like!

BRETT

Well he's... he's... black

JULES

go on!

BRETT

...and he's... he's... bald

JULES

does he look like a bitch?!

BRETT

(without thinking)

What?

JULES

Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

BRETT

(in agony)

No.

JULES

Then why did you try to fuck 'im

like a bitch?!

BRETT

(in spasm)

I didn't.

JULES

Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck

'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT

(in spasm)

Yes.

JULES

There's a passage I got memorized,

seems appropriate for this situation:

Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the

righteous man is beset on all sides

by the inequities of the selfish and

the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is

he who, in the name of charity and

good will, shepherds the weak through

the valley of darkness, for he is

truly his brother's keeper and the

finder of lost children. And I will

strike down upon thee with great

vengeance and furious anger those

who attempt to poison and destroy my

brothers. And you will know my name

is the Lord when I lay my vengeance

upon you."

"VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE"

MARSELLUS (O.S.)

I think you're gonna find  when all

this shit is over and done  I think

you're gonna find yourself one smilin'

motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right

now you got ability. But painful as

it may be, ability don't last. Now

that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of

life, but it's a fact of life your

ass is gonna hafta git realistic

about. This business is filled to

the brim with unrealistic

motherfuckers who thought their ass

aged like wine.  Besides, even if

you went all the way, what would you

be? Feather-weight champion of the

world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you

can even get a credit card based on

that.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)

Now the night of the fight, you may

fell a slight sting, that's pride

fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride

only hurts, it never helps. Fight

through that shit. 'Cause a year

from now, when you're kickin' it in

the Caribbean you're gonna say,

"Marsellus Wallace was right."

BUTCH

I got no problem with that.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)

In the fifth, your ass goes down.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)

Say it!

BUTCH

In the fifth, my ass goes down.

CUT TO:

ENGLISH DAVE

Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,

git your ass on in here.

VINCENT

Where's the big man?

ENGLISH DAVE

He's over there, finishing up some

business.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)

Hang back for a second or two, and

when you see the white boy leave, go

on over.  In the meanwhile, can I

make you an espresso?

VINCENT

How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'

American?

ENGLISH DAVE

Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia

out tomorrow?

VINCENT

At Marsellus' request.

ENGLISH DAVE

Have you met Mia?

VINCENT

Not yet.

VINCENT

What's so funny?

ENGLISH DAVE

Not a goddamn thing.

VINCENT

Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big

man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit

across a table, chew my food with my

mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and

that's all I'm gonna do.

ENGLISH DAVE

My name's Paul, and this is between

y'all.

BUTCH

(to English Dave)

Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

ENGLISH DAVE

Filters?

BUTCH

Non.

BUTCH

Lookin' at somethin', friend?

VINCENT

I ain't your friend, palooka.

BUTCH

What was that?

VINCENT

I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)

Vincent Vega has entered the building,

git your ass over here!

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)

Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

DISSOLVE TO:

JODY

...I'll lend it to you. It's a great

book on body piercing.

TRUDI

You know how they use that gun when

they pierce your ears? They don't

use that when they pierce your

nipples, do they?

JODY

Forget that gun. That gun goes against

the entire idea behind piercing. All

of my piercing, sixteen places on my

body, every one of 'em done with a

needle. Five in each ear. One through

the nipple on my left breast. One

through my right nostril.  One through

my left eyebrow. One through my lip.

One in my clit. And I wear a stud in

my tongue.

VINCENT

(interrupting)

Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm

curious, why would you get a stud in

your tongue?

JODY

It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

LANCE (O.S.)

Vince, you can come in now!

LANCE

Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very

good stuff. This is Bava, different,

but equally good. And this is Choco

from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.

Now the first two are the same, forty-

five an ounce  those are friend

prices  but this one...

(pointing to the Choco)

...this one's a little more expensive.

It's fifty-five. But when you shoot

it, you'll know where that extra

money went.  Nothing wrong with the

first two. It's real, real, real,

good shit. But this one's a fuckin'

madman.

VINCENT

Remember, I just got back from

Amsterdam.

LANCE

Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?

No.  You're in my house. White people

who know the difference between good

shit and bad shit, this is the house

they come to. My shit, I'll take the

Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit

any ol' day of the fuckin' week.

VINCENT

That's a bold statement.

LANCE

This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is

a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'

dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back

in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole

seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,

they're as hot as hell.

VINCENT

Give me three hundred worth of the

madman.  If it's as good as you say,

I'll be back for a thousand.

LANCE

I just hope I still have it. Whaddya

think of Trudi? She ain't got a

boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get

high?

VINCENT

Which one's Trudi? The one with all

the shit in her face?

LANCE

No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

VINCENT

I'm on my way somewhere. I got a

dinner engagement. Rain check?

LANCE

No problem?

VINCENT

You don't mind if I shoot up here?

LANCE

Me casa, su casa.

VINCENT

Mucho gracias.

LANCE

Still got your Malibu?

VINCENT

You know what some fucker did to it

the other day?

LANCE

What?

VINCENT

Fuckin' keyed it.

LANCE

Oh man, that's fucked up.

VINCENT

Tell me about it. I had the goddamn

thing in storage three years. It's

out five fuckin' days  five days,

and some dickless piece of shit fucks

with it.

LANCE

They should be fuckin' killed. No

trial, no jury, straight to execution.

VINCENT

I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,

ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything

to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been

worth his doin' it, if I coulda just

caught 'em, you know what I mean?

LANCE

It's chicken shit. You don't fuck

another man's vehicle.

(into intercom)

Okay.

(licks lips)

MIA

Let's go.

VINCENT

What the fuck is this place?

MIA

This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis

man should love it.

VINCENT

Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

MIA

You can get a steak here, daddy-o.

Don't be a...

VINCENT

After you, kitty-cat.

BUDDY

Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

VINCENT

I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

BUDDY

How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,

or bloody as hell?

VINCENT

Bloody as hell. And to drink, a

vanilla coke.

BUDDY

How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

MIA

I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger

bloody  and a five-dollar shake.

BUDDY

How d'ya want that shake, Martin and

Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

MIA

Martin and Lewis.

VINCENT

Did you just order a five-dollar

shake?

MIA

Sure did.

VINCENT

A shake? Milk and ice cream?

MIA

Uh-huh.

VINCENT

It costs five dollars?

BUDDY

Yep.

VINCENT

You don't put bourbon in it or

anything?

BUDDY

Nope.

VINCENT

Just checking.

MIA

Whaddya think?

VINCENT

It's like a wax museum with a pulse

rate.

MIA

What are you doing?

VINCENT

Rollin' a smoke.

MIA

Here?

VINCENT

It's just tobacco.

MIA

Oh. Well in that case, will you roll

me one, cowboy?

VINCENT

You can have this one, cowgirl.

MIA

Thanks.

VINCENT

Think nothing of it.

MIA

Marsellus said you just got back

from Amsterdam.

VINCENT

Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

MIA

That was my fifteen minutes.

VINCENT

What was it?

MIA

It was show about a team of female

secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

VINCENT

What?

MIA

"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a

bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in

we're a force to be reckoned with.

Five, as in there's one... two ...

three... four... five of us. There

was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal

from that show "Baton Rouge," she

was the leader. A Japanese one, a

black one, a French one and a brunette

one, me.  We all had special skills.

Sommerset had a photographic memory,

the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,

the black girl was a demolition

expert, the French fox' specialty

was sex...

VINCENT

What was your specialty?

MIA

Knives. The character I played, Raven

McCoy, her background was she was

raised by circus performers. So she

grew up doing a knife act. According

to the show, she was the deadliest

woman in the world with a knife. But

because she grew up in a circus, she

was also something of an acrobat.

She could do illusions, she was a

trapeze artist  when you're keeping

the world safe from evil, you never

know when being a trapeze artist's

gonna come in handy. And she knew a

zillion old jokes her grandfather,

an old vaudevillian, taught her. If

we woulda got picked up, they woulda

worked in a gimmick where every

episode I woulda told and ol joke.

VINCENT

Do you remember any of the jokes?

MIA

Well I only got the chance to say

one, 'cause we only did one show.

VINCENT

Tell me.

MIA

No. It's really corny.

VINCENT

C'mon, don't be that way.

MIA

No. You won't like it and I'll be

embarrassed.

VINCENT

You told it in front of fifty million

people and you can't tell it to me?

I promise I won't laugh.

MIA

(laughing)

That's what I'm afraid of.

VINCENT

That's not what I meant and you know

it.

MIA

You're quite the silver tongue devil,

aren't you?

VINCENT

I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

MIA

That's not what you said Vince. Well

now I'm definitely not gonna tell

ya, 'cause it's been built up too

much.

VINCENT

What a gyp.

MIA

Yummy!

VINCENT

Can I have a sip of that? I'd like

to know what a five-dollar shake

tastes like.

MIA

Be my guest.

MIA

You can use my straw, I don't have

kooties.

VINCENT

Yeah, but maybe I do.

MIA

Kooties I can handle.

VINCENT

Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'

good milk shake.

MIA

Told ya.

VINCENT

I don't know if it's worth five

dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'

good.

MIA

Don't you hate that?

VINCENT

What?

MIA

Uncomfortable silences. Why do we

feel it's necessary to yak about

bullshit in order to be comfortable?

VINCENT

I don't know.

MIA

That's when you know you found

somebody special. When you can just

shit the fuck up for a minute, and

comfortably share silence.

VINCENT

I don't think we're there yet. But

don't feel bad, we just met each

other.

MIA

Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to

the bathroom and powder my nose,

while you sit here and think of

something to say.

VINCENT

I'll do that.

MIA

(imitating Steppenwolf)

I said goddamn!

MIA

Don't you love it when you go to the

bathroom and you come back to find

your food waiting for you?

VINCENT

We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy

Holly doesn't seem to be much of a

waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn

Monroe's section.

MIA

Which one, there's two Marilyn

Monroes.

VINCENT

No there's not.

VINCENT

That's Marilyn Monroe...

VINCENT

... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I

don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it

must be her night off.

MIA

Pretty smart.

VINCENT

I have moments.

MIA

Did ya think of something to say?

VINCENT

Actually, there's something I've

wanted to ask you about, but you

seem like a nice person, and I didn't

want to offend you.

MIA

Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like

mindless, boring, getting-to-know-

you chit-chat. This sounds like you

actually have something to say.

VINCENT

Only if you promise not to get

offended.

MIA

You can't promise something like

that. I have no idea what you're

gonna ask. You could ask me what

you're gonna ask me, and my natural

response could be to be offended.

Then, through no fault of my own, I

woulda broken my promise.

VINCENT

Then let's just forget it.

MIA

That is an impossibility. Trying to

forget anything as intriguing as

this would be an exercise in futility.

VINCENT

Is that a fact?

MIA

Besides, it's more exciting when you

don't have permission.

VINCENT

What do you think about what happened

to Antwan?

MIA

Who's Antwan?

VINCENT

Tony Rocky Horror.

MIA

He fell out of a window.

VINCENT

That's one way to say it. Another

way is, he was thrown out. Another

was is, he was thrown out by

Marsellus. And even another way is,

he was thrown out of a window by

Marsellus because of you.

MIA

Is that a fact?

VINCENT

No it's not, it's just what I heard.

MIA

Who told you this?

VINCENT

They.

MIA

They talk a lot, don't they?

VINCENT

They certainly do.

MIA

Well don't by shy Vincent, what

exactly did they say?

MIA

Let me help you Bashful, did it

involve the F-word?

VINCENT

No. They just said Rocky Horror gave

you a foot massage.

MIA

And...?

VINCENT

No and, that's it.

MIA

You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror

out of a four-story window because

he massaged my feet?

VINCENT

Yeah.

MIA

And you believed that?

VINCENT

At the time I was told, it seemed

reasonable.

MIA

Marsellus throwing Tony out of a

four story window for giving me a

foot massage seemed reasonable?

VINCENT

No, it seemed excessive. But that

doesn't mean it didn't happen. I

heard Marsellus is very protective

of you.

MIA

A husband being protective of his

wife is one thing. A husband almost

killing another man for touching his

wife's feet is something else.

VINCENT

But did it happen?

MIA

The only thing Antwan ever touched

of mine was my hand, when he shook

it. I met Anwan once  at my wedding

then never again.  The truth is,

nobody knows why Marsellus tossed

Tony Rocky Horror out of that window

except Marsellus and Tony Rocky

Horror. But when you scamps get

together, you're worse than a sewing

circle.

ED SULLIVAN

(into microphone)

Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment

you've all been waiting for, the

worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist

contest.

ED SULLIVAN

...One lucky couple will win this

handsome trophy that Marilyn here is

holding.

ED SULLIVAN

...Now, who will be our first

contestants?

MIA

Right here.

MIA

I wanna dance.

VINCENT

No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

MIA

(overlapping)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do

believe Marsellus, my husband, your

boss, told you to take me out and do

whatever I wanted, Now, I want to

dance. I want to win. I want that

trophy.

VINCENT

(sighs)

All right.

MIA

So, dance good.

VINCENT

All right, you asked for it.

ED SULLIVAN

(into microphone)

Let's hear it for our first

contestants.

ED SULLIVAN

Now let's meet our first contestants

here this evening. Young lady, what

is your name?

MIA

(into microphone)

Missus Mia Wallace.

ED SULLIVAN

(into microphone)

And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

MIA

(into microphone)

Vincent Vega.

ED SULLIVAN

(into microphone)

All right, let's see what you can

do. Take it away!

VINCENT

Was than an uncomfortable silence?

MIA

I don't know what that was.

(pause)

Music and drinks!

VINCENT

I'm gonna take a piss.

MIA

That was a little bit more information

than I needed to know, but go right

ahead.

MIA

(like you would say

Bingo!)

Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,

you've been holding out on me.

CUT TO:

VINCENT

One drink and leave. Don't be rude,

but drink your drink quickly, say

goodbye, walk out the door, get in

your car, and go down the road.

VINCENT

...It's a moral test of yourself,

whether or not you can maintain

loyalty. Because when people are

loyal to each other, that's very

meaningful.

VINCENT

So you're gonna go out there, drink

your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had

a very lovely evening," go home, and

jack off.  And that's all you're

gonna do.

VINCENT

Jesus Christ!

VINCENT

(sounding weird)

Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

VINCENT

(to himself)

I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.

(to Mia)

Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer

me honey, what did you take?

VINCENT

(yelling to Mia)

Okay honey, we're getting you on

your feet.

VINCENT

We're on our feet now, and now we're

gonna talk out to the car. Here we

go, watch us walk.

PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)

Hold hands, you love birds.

JODY (O.S.)

Lance! The phone's ringing!

LANCE

I can hear it!

JODY (O.S.)

I thought you told those fuckin'

LANCE

Hello, do you know how late it is?

You're not supposed to be callin' me

VINCENT

Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big

LANCE

Whoa, hold you horses man, what's

the problem?

VINCENT

You still got an adrenaline shot?

LANCE

(dawning on him)

Maybe.

VINCENT

I need it man, I got a chick she's

fuckin'  Doing on me.

LANCE

Don't bring her here!  I'm not even

fuckin' joking with you, don't you

be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt

VINCENT

No choice.

LANCE

She's ODin'?

VINCENT

Yeah. She's dyin'.

LANCE

Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take

'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

VINCENT

Negative.

LANCE

She ain't my fuckin' problem, you

phone?

VINCENT

Sorry.

LANCE

I don't know you, who is this, don't

VINCENT

Too late, I'm already here.

JODY (O.S.)

What the hell was that?

LANCE

Have you lost your mind?! You crashed

your car in my fuckin' house! You

talk about drug shit on a cellular

fuckin' phone

VINCENT

If you're through havin' your little

hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get

your needle and git it now!

LANCE

Are you deaf? You're not bringin'

that fucked up bitch in my house!

VINCENT

This fucked up bitch is Marsellus

Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'

croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But

before he turns me into a bar soap,

I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about

how you coulda saved her life, but

instead you let her die on your front

lawn.

JODY

It's only one-thirty in the goddamn

mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on

out here?

JODY

Who's she?

LANCE

Get that black box in the bedroom I

have with the adrenaline shot.

JODY

What's wrong with her?

VINCENT

She's ODing on us.

JODY

Well get her the hell outta here!

LANCE AND VINCENT

(in stereo)

Get the fuckin' shot!

JODY

Don't yell and me!

VINCENT

(to Lance)

You two are a match made in heaven.

LANCE

Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?

While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta

get a medical book.

VINCENT

What do you need a medical book for?

LANCE

To tell me how to do it. I've never

given an adrenaline shot before.

VINCENT

You've had that thing for six years

and you never used it?

LANCE

I never had to use it. I don't go

joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all

of my friends can handle their highs!

VINCENT

Well then get it.

LANCE

I am, if you'll let me.

VINCENT

I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

LANCE

Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'

to her.

VINCENT (O.S.)

Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

LANCE

(calling back)

I'm looking as fast as I can!

JODY (O.S.)

What's he lookin' for?

VINCENT (O.S.)

I dunno, some medical book.

JODY (O.S.)

What are you lookin' for?

LANCE

My black medical book!

JODY

Whata're you looking for?

LANCE

My black fuckin' medical book. It's

like a text book they give to nurses.

JODY

I never saw a medical book.

LANCE

Trust me, I have one.

JODY

Well if it's that important, why

didn't you keep it with the shot?

LANCE

I don't know! Stop bothering me!

JODY

While you're lookin' for it, that

girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're

never gonna find it in all this shit.

For six months now, I've been telling

you to clean this room

VINCENT (O.S.)

get your ass in here, fuck the

book!

VINCENT

Quit fuckin' around man and give her

the shot!

LANCE

While I'm doing this, take her shirt

off and find her heart.

VINCENT

Does it have to be exact?

LANCE

Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving

her an injection in the heart, so I

gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

VINCENT

Well, I don't know exactly where her

heart is, I think it's here.

LANCE

That's it.

VINCENT

I need a big fat magic marker, got

one?

JODY

What?

VINCENT

I need a big fat magic marker, any

felt pen'll do, but a magic marker

would be great.

JODY

Hold on.

LANCE

It's ready, I'll tell you what to

do.

VINCENT

You're gonna give her the shot.

LANCE

No, you're gonna give her the shot.

VINCENT

I've never does this before.

LANCE

I've never done this before either,

and I ain't starting now. You brought

'er here, that means you give her

the shot. The day I bring an ODing

bitch to your place, then I gotta

give her the shot.

JODY

Got it.

VINCENT

Okay, what do I do?

LANCE

Well, you're giving her an injection

of adrenaline straight to her heart.

But she's got a breast plate in front

of her heart, so you gotta pierce

through that. So what you gotta do

is bring the needle down in a stabbing

motion.

VINCENT

I gotta stab her?

LANCE

If you want the needle to pierce

through to her heart, you gotta stab

her hard.

VINCENT

What happens after that?

LANCE

I'm curious about that myself.

VINCENT

This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

LANCE

She's supposed to come out of it

like

(snaps his fingers)

that.

VINCENT

Count to three.

LANCE

One...

LANCE (O.S.)

...two...

LANCE (O.S.)

...three!

LANCE

If you're okay, say something.

MIA

Something.

JODY

Anybody want a beer?

CUT TO:

VINCENT (O.S.)

Mia!

VINCENT

What are your thoughts on how to

handle this?

MIA

What's yours?

VINCENT

Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus

can live his whole live and never

ever hear of this incident.

MIA

Don't worry about it. If Marsellus

ever heard of this, I'd be in as

much trouble as you.

VINCENT

I seriously doubt that.

MIA

If you can keep a secret, so can I.

VINCENT

Let's shake on it.

VINCENT

Mum's the word.

VINCENT

If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home

and have a heart attack.

MIA

You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE

FIVE" joke?

VINCENT

Sure, but I think I'm still a little

too petrified to laugh.

MIA

Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's

not funny. But if you still wanna

hear it, I'll tell it.

VINCENT

I can't wait.

MIA

Three tomatoes are walking down the

street, a poppa tomato, a momma

tomato, and a little baby tomato.

The baby tomato is lagging behind

the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa

tomato gets mad, goes over to the

momma tomato and stamps on him

and says: catch up.

Butch, stop watching TV a second. We

got a special visitor. Now do you

remember when I told you your daddy

dies in a P.O.W. camp?

BUTCH (O.S.)

Uh-huh.

MOTHER

Well this here is Capt. Koons. He

was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

CAPT. KOONS

Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard

a bunch about you. See, I was a good

friend of your Daddy's. We were in

that Hanoi pit of hell over five

years together.  Hopefully, you'll

never have to experience this

yourself, but when two men are in a

situation like me and your Daddy

were, for as long as we were, you

take on certain responsibilities of

the other. If it had been me who had

not made it, Major Coolidge would be

talkin' right now to my son Jim. But

the way it worked out is I'm talkin'

to you, Butch. I got somethin' for

ya.

CAPT. KOONS

This watch I got here was first

purchased by your great-granddaddy.

It was bought during the First World

War in a little general store in

Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought

by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge

the day he set sail for Paris. It

was your great-granddaddy's war watch,

made by the first company to ever

make wrist watches. You see, up until

then, people just carried pocket

watches. Your great-granddaddy wore

that watch every day he was in the

war. Then when he had done his duty,

he went home to your great-

grandmother, took the watch off his

wrist and put it in an ol' coffee

can. And in that can it stayed 'til

your grandfather Dane Coolidge was

called upon by his country to go

overseas and fight the Germans once

again. This time they called it World

War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave

it to your granddad for good luck.

Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as

good as his old man's. Your granddad

was a Marine and he was killed with

all the other Marines at the battle

of Wake Island. Your granddad was

facing death and he knew it. None of

those boys had any illusions about

ever leavin' that island alive. So

three days before the Japanese took

the island, your 22-year old

grandfather asked a gunner on an Air

Force transport named Winocki, a man

he had never met before in his life,

to deliver to his infant son, who he

had never seen in the flesh, his

gold watch. Three days later, your

grandfather was dead. But Winocki

kept his word. After the war was

over, he paid a visit to your

grandmother, delivering to your infant

father, his Dad's gold watch. This

watch. This watch was on your Daddy's

wrist when he was shot down over

Hanoi. He was captured and put in a

Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew

if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd

be confiscated. The way your Daddy

looked at it, that watch was your

birthright. And he'd be damned if

and slopeheads were gonna put their

greasy yella hands on his boy's

birthright. So he hid it in the one

place he knew he could hide somethin'.

His ass. Five long years, he wore

this watch up his ass. Then when he

died of dysentery, he gave me the

watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk

of metal up my ass for two years.

Then, after seven years, I was sent

home to my family. And now, little

man, I give the watch to you.

"THE GOLD WATCH"

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)

Well Dan, that had to be the

bloodiest and, hands-down, the most

brutal fight this city has ever seen.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)

...Coolidge was out of there faster

than I've ever seen a victorious

boxer vacate the ring. Do you think

he knew Willis was dead?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)

My guess would be yes, Richard. I

could see from my position here, the

frenzy in his eyes give way to the

realization of what he was doing. I

think any man would've left the ring

that fast.

DISSOLVE TO:

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)

Do you feel this ring death tragedy

will have an effect on the world of

boxing?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)

Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't

help but shake the world of boxing

to its very foundation. But it's of

paramount importance that during the

sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the

W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the

ESMARELDA

Are you the man I was supposed to

pick up?

BUTCH

If you're the cab I called, I'm the

ESMARELDA

Outta here.

VINCENT

Mia. How you doin'?

MIA

Great. I never thanked you for the

dinner.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)

What'cha got?

ENGLISH DAVE

He booked.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)

I'm prepared to scour the earth for

this motherfucker. If Butch goes to

Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'

in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a

cap in his ass.

ENGLISH DAVE

I'll take care of it.

BUTCH

Hey, how do I open the window back

here?

ESMARELDA

I have to do it.

ESMARELDA

Hey, mister?

BUTCH

(still working on the

glove)

What?

ESMARELDA

You were in that fight? The fight on

the radio  you're the fighter?

BUTCH

Whatever gave you that idea?

ESMARELDA

No c'mon, you're him, I know you're

him, tell me you're him.

BUTCH

(drying himself with

a gym towel)

I'm him.

ESMARELDA

You killed the other boxing man.

BUTCH

He's dead?

ESMARELDA

The radio said he was dead.

BUTCH

(to himself)

Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

ESMARELDA

What does it feel like?

BUTCH

(finds his shirt)

What does what feel like?

ESMARELDA

Killing a man. Beating another man

to death with your bare hands.

BUTCH

Are you some kinda weirdo?

ESMARELDA

No, it's a subject I have much

interest in. You are the first person

I ever met who has killed somebody.

So, what was it like to kill a man?

BUTCH

Tell ya what, you give me one of

them cigarettes, I'll give you an

answer.

ESMARELDA

Deal!

BUTCH

So...

BUTCH

...Esmarelda Villalobos  is that

Mexican?

ESMARELDA

The name is Spanish, but I'm

Columbian.

BUTCH

It's a very pretty name.

ESMARELDA

It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

BUTCH

That's one hell of a name you got

there, sister.

ESMARELDA

Thank you. And what is your name?

BUTCH

Butch.

ESMARELDA

Butch. What does it mean?

BUTCH

I'm an American, our names don't

mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,

what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

ESMARELDA

I want to know what it feels like to

kill a man

BUTCH

I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know

he was dead 'til you told me he was

dead. Now I know he's dead, do you

wanna know how I feel about it?

BUTCH

I don't feel the least little bit

bad.

BUTCH

(into phone)

What'd I tell ya, soon as the word

got out a fix was in, the odds would

be outta control. Hey, if he was a

better fighter he's be alive. If he

never laced up his gloves in the

first place, which he never shoulda

done, he'd be alive. Enough about

the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's

talk about the rich and prosperous

Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you

spread it around with?

(PAUSE)

Eight? How long to collect?

So by tomorrow evening, you'll have

it all?

Good news Scotty, real good news  I

couple days to get into Knoxville.

Next time we see each other, it'll

be on Tennessee time.

BUTCH

(to himself in French

with English subtitles)

Fabienne my love, our adventure

begins.

CUT TO:

ESMARELDA

Forty-five sixty.

BUTCH

Merci beaucoup. And here's a little

something for the effort.

BUTCH

Now if anybody should ask you about

who your fare was tonight, what're

you gonna tell 'em?

ESMARELDA

The truth. Three well-dressed,

slightly toasted, Mexicans.

BUTCH

Bon soir, Esmarelda.

ESMARELDA

(in Spanish)

Sleep well, Butch.

FABIENNE

Keep the light off.

BUTCH

Is that better, sugar pop?

FABIENNE

Oui. Hard day at the office?

BUTCH

Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

FABIENNE

Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

FABIENNE

I was looking at myself in the mirror.

BUTCH

Uh-huh?

FABIENNE

I wish I had a pot.

BUTCH

You were lookin' in the mirror and

you wish you had some pot?

FABIENNE

A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are

sexy.

BUTCH

Well you should be happy, 'cause you

do.

FABIENNE

Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!

I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna

when she did "Lucky Star," it's not

the same thing.

BUTCH

I didn't realize there was a

difference between a tummy and a pot

belly.

FABIENNE

The difference is huge.

BUTCH

You want me to have a pot?

FABIENNE

No. Pot bellies make a man look either

oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a

woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The

rest of you is normal. Normal face,

normal legs, normal hips, normal

ass, but with a big, perfectly round

pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a

tee-shirt two sizes too small to

accentuate it.

BUTCH

You think guys would find that

attractive?

FABIENNE

I don't give a damn what men find

attractive. It's unfortunate what we

find pleasing to the touch and

pleasing to the eye is seldom the

same.

BUTCH

If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in

it.

FABIENNE

You'd punch me in my belly?

BUTCH

Right in the belly.

FABIENNE

I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your

right on your face 'til you couldn't

breathe.

BUTCH

You'd do that to me?

FABIENNE

Yes!

BUTCH

Did you get everything, sugar pop?

FABIENNE

Yes, I did.

BUTCH

Good job.

FABIENNE

Did everything go as planned?

BUTCH

You didn't listen to the radio?

FABIENNE

I never listen to your fights. Were

you the winner?

BUTCH

I won alright.

FABIENNE

Are you still retiring?

BUTCH

Sure am.

FABIENNE

What about the man you fought?

BUTCH

Floyd retired too.

FABIENNE

(smiling)

Really?! He won't be fighting no

more?!

BUTCH

Not no more.

FABIENNE

So it all worked out in the finish?

BUTCH

We ain't at the finish, baby.

FABIENNE

We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

FABIENNE

If they find us, they'll kill us,

won't they?

FABIENNE

But they won't find us, will they?

FABIENNE

Do you still want me to go with you?

FABIENNE

I don't want to be a burden or a

nuisance -

FABIENNE

Say it!

BUTCH

Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

FABIENNE

Forever?

BUTCH

...and ever.

FABIENNE

Do you love me?

BUTCH

Oui.

FABIENNE

Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

BUTCH

Will you kiss it?

FABIENNE

But you first.

FABIENNE

(in French, with

English subtitles)

Butch my love, the adventure begins.

FADE TO BLACK

BUTCH

I think I cracked a rib.

FABIENNE

Giving me oral pleasure?

BUTCH

No retard, from the fight.

FABIENNE

Don't call me retard.

BUTCH

(in a Mongoloid voice)

My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

FABIENNE

Shut up fuck head! I hate that

Mongoloid voice.

BUTCH

Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it

back!  Can I have a towel please,

Miss Beautiful Tulip.

FABIENNE

Oh I like that, I like being called

a tulip. Tulip is much better than

Mongoloid.

BUTCH

I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I

called you a retard, but I took it

back.

BUTCH

Merci beaucoup.

FABIENNE

Butch?

BUTCH

(drying his head)

Yes, lemon pie.

FABIENNE

Where are we going to go?

BUTCH

I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.

We're gonna get a lot of money from

this. But it ain't gonna be so much,

we can live like hogs in the fat

house forever. I was thinking we

could go somewhere in the South

Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll

carry us a long way down there.

FABIENNE

So if we wanted, we could live in

Bora Bora?

BUTCH

You betcha. And if after awhile you

don't dig Bora Bora, then we can

move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

FABIENNE

But I do not speak Spanish.

BUTCH

You don't speak Bora Boran either.

Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta

el zapataria?

FABIENNE

What does that mean?

BUTCH

Where's the shoe store?

FABIENNE

Donde esta el zapataria?

BUTCH

Excellent pronunciation. You'll be

my little mama ceta in no time.

BUTCH (O.S.)

Que hora es?

FABIENNE

Que hora es?

BUTCH (O.S.)

What time is it?

FABIENNE

What time is it?

BUTCH (O.S.)

Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

FABIENNE

Butch.

FABIENNE

Forget it.

FADE TO BLACK

FABIENNE

Merde! You startled me. Did you have

a bad dream?

BUTCH

What are you watching?

FABIENNE

A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the

name.

BUTCH

Are you watchin' it?

FABIENNE

In a way. Why? Would you like for me

to switch it off?

BUTCH

Would you please?

BUTCH

It's a little too early in the morning

for explosions and war.

FABIENNE

What was it about?

BUTCH

How should I know, you were the one

watchin' it.

FABIENNE

No, imbecile, what was your dream

about?

BUTCH

Oh, I... don't remember. It's really

rare I remember a dream.

FABIENNE

You just woke up from it.

BUTCH

Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I

don't remember.

FABIENNE

Well, let's look at the grumpy man

in the morning. I didn't say you

were lying, it's just odd you don't

remember your dreams. I always

remember mine. Did you know you talk

in your sleep?

BUTCH

I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk

in my sleep?

FABIENNE

You did last night.

BUTCH

What did I say?

FABIENNE

I don't know. I couldn't understand

you.

FABIENNE

Why don't you get up and we'll get

some breakfast at that breakfast

place with the pancakes.

BUTCH

One more kiss and I'll get up.

FABIENNE

Satisfied?

BUTCH

Yep.

FABIENNE

Then get up, lazy bones.

BUTCH

What time is it?

FABIENNE

Almost nine in the morning. What

time does our train arrive?

BUTCH

Eleven.

FABIENNE

I'm gonna order a big plate of

blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,

eggs over easy, and five sausages.

BUTCH

(surprised at her

potential appetite)

Anything to drink with that?

FABIENNE

(referring to his

clothes)

Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a

tall glass or orange juice and a

black cup of coffee. After that, I'm

going to have a slice of pie.

BUTCH

Pie for breakfast?

FABIENNE

Any time of the day is a good time

for pie. Blueberry pie to go with

the pancakes. And on top, a thin

slice of melted cheese

BUTCH

where's my watch?

FABIENNE

It's there.

BUTCH

No, it's not. It's not here.

FABIENNE

Have you looked?

BUTCH

Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

BUTCH

What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!

Are you sure you got it?

FABIENNE

Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer

BUTCH

on the little kangaroo.

FABIENNE

Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

BUTCH

Well it's not here!

FABIENNE

(on the verge of tears)

Well it should be!

BUTCH

Oh it most definitely should be here,

but it's not. So where is it?

BUTCH

Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'

watch. You know what my father went

through to git me that watch?... I

don't wanna get into it right now...

but he went through a lot. Now all

this other shit, you coulda set on

fire, but I specifically reminded

you not to forget my father's watch.

Now think, did you get it?

FABIENNE

I believe so...

BUTCH

You believe so? You either did, or

you didn't, now which one is it?

FABIENNE

Then I did.

BUTCH

Are you sure?

FABIENNE

(shaking)

No.

BUTCH

(to Fabienne)

No! It's not your fault.

(he approached her)

You left it at the apartment.

BUTCH

If you did leave it at the apartment,

it's not your fault. I had you bring

a bunch of stuff. I reminded you

about it, but I didn't illustrate

how personal the watch was to me. If

all I gave a fuck about was my watch,

I should've told you. You ain't a

mind reader.

FABIENNE

I'm sorry.

BUTCH

Don't be. It just means I won't be

able to eat breakfast with you.

FABIENNE

Why does it mean that?

BUTCH

Because I'm going back to my apartment

to get my watch.

FABIENNE

Won't the gangsters be looking for

you there?

BUTCH

That's what I'm gonna find out. If

they are, and I don't think I can

handle it, I'll split.

FABIENNE

I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,

I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

BUTCH

Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing

you could ever do would make me

permanently angry at you.

(pause)

I love you, remember?

(he digs some money

out of his wallet)

Now here's some money, order those

pancakes and have a great breakfast.

FABIENNE

Don't go.

BUTCH

I'll be back before you can say,

blueberry pie.

FABIENNE

Blueberry pie.

BUTCH

Well maybe not that fast, but fast.

Okay?  Okay?

FABIENNE

Okay.

BUTCH

Bye-bye, sugar pop.

FABIENNE

Bye.

BUTCH

I'm gonna take your Honda.

FABIENNE

Okay.

BUTCH

Of all the fuckin' things she coulda

forgot, she forgets my father's watch.

I specifically reminded her not to

forget it. "Bedside table  on the

kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't

forget my father's watch."

CUT TO:

BUTCH

(softly)

Holy shit.

BUTCH

That's how you're gonna beat 'em,

Butch.  They keep underestimatin'

ya.

PEDESTRIAN

Jesus, are you okay?

BUTCH

I guess.

GAWKER #1

(to the others)

He's dead! He's dead!

GAWKER #2

If you need a witness in court, I'll

be glad to help. He was a drunken

maniac. He hit you and crashed into

that car.

MARSELLUS

(still incoherent)

Who?

GAWKER #2

(pointing at Butch)

Him.

MARSELLUS

Well, I'll be damned.

BUTCH

Sacre bleu.

LOOKY-LOO WOMAN

Oh my God, I've been shot!

MAYNARD

Can I help you wit' somethin'?

BUTCH

Shut up!

MAYNARD

Now you just wait one goddamn minute

BUTCH

So you like chasing people, huh?

BUTCH

Well guess what, big man, you caught

me

MAYNARD (O.S.)

hold it right there, godammit!

BUTCH

Look mister, this ain't any of your

business

MAYNARD

I'm makin' it my business! Now

toss that gun!

MAYNARD

Now you on top, stand up and come to

the counter.

MAYNARD

Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just

caught a coupl'a flies.

FADE TO BLACK

MAYNARD

Nobody kills anybody in my place of

business except me or Zed.

MAYNARD

That's Zed.

ZED

(to Maynard)

You said you waited for me?

MAYNARD

I did.

ZED

Then how come they're all beat up?

MAYNARD

They did that to each other. They

was fightin' when they came in. This

one was gonna shoot that one.

ZED

(to Butch)

You were gonna shoot him?

ZED

Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front

of this place?

MAYNARD

Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

ZED

No, it's Thursday.

MAYNARD

Then she'll be fine.

ZED

Bring out The Gimp.

MAYNARD

I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

ZED

Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em

up then, won't you?

MAYNARD

(yelling in the hole)

Wake up!

MAYNARD

(to The Gimp)

Down!

MAYNARD

Who's first?

ZED

I ain't fer sure yet.

ZED

Wanna do it here?

MAYNARD

Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old

room.

MAYNARD

(to The Gimp)

Up!

MAYNARD

Keep an eye on this one.

MAYNARD (O.S.)

Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight

in 'em!

ZED (O.S.)

You wanna fight? You wanna fight?

Good, I like to fight!

MAYNARD (O.S.)

That's it... that's it boy, you're

goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like

that... that's good.

(grunting faster)

Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!

Zed goddammit, git over here and

hold 'em!

THE GIMP

Huhng?

BUTCH

Hey hillbilly.

BUTCH

You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)

Step aside, Butch.

BUTCH

You okay?

MARSELLUS

Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from

okay!

BUTCH

What now?

MARSELLUS

What now? Well let me tell you what

now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-

hittin' niggers, who'll go to work

on homes here with a pair of pliers

and a blow torch.

(to Zed)

Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I

ain't through with you by a damn

sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on

your ass.

BUTCH

I meant what now, between me and

you?

MARSELLUS

Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell

ya what now between me an' you. There

is no me an' you. Not no more.

BUTCH

So we're cool?

MARSELLUS

Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I

ask  two things I ask: Don't tell

nobody about this. This shit's between

me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-

the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-

agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It

ain't nobody else's business. Two:

leave town. Tonight. Right now. And

when you're gone, stay gone.  You've

lost your Los Angeles privileges.

Deal?

BUTCH

Deal.

MARSELLUS

Go on now, get your ass outta here.

MARSELLUS

(into the phone)

Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta

bit of a situation.

FABIENNE (O.S.)

Butch, I was so worried!

BUTCH

Honey, grab your radio and your purse

and let's go!

FABIENNE (O.S.)

But what about all our bags?

BUTCH

Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train

if we don't split now.

FABIENNE (O.S.)

Is everything well? Are we in danger?

BUTCH

We're cool. In fact, we're super-

cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait

for you outside.

FABIENNE

Where did you get this motorcycle?

BUTCH

(he kick-starts it)

It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

FABIENNE

What happened to my Honda?

BUTCH

Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

FABIENNE

You're hurt?

BUTCH

I might've broke my nose, no biggie.

Hop on.

BUTCH

Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

BUTCH

I'm sorry, baby-love.

FABIENNE

(crying)

You were gone so long, I started to

think dreadful thoughts.

BUTCH

I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.

Everything's fine. Hey, how was

breakfast?

FABIENNE

(waterworks drying a

little)

It was good

BUTCH

did you get the blueberry pancakes?

FABIENNE

No, they didn't have blueberry

pancakes, I had to get buttermilk

are you sure you're okay?

BUTCH

Baby-love, from the moment I left

you, this has been without a doubt

the single weirdest day of my entire

life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about

it.

FABIENNE

Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

BUTCH

It's a chopper.

FABIENNE

Whose chopper is this?

BUTCH

Zed's.

FABIENNE

Who's Zed?

BUTCH

Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

FADE TO BLACK

"JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"

JULES (O.S.)

You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT (O.S.)

Yes!

JULES (O.S.)

There's a passage I got memorized,

seems appropriate for this situation:

Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the

righteous man is beset on all sides

by the inequities of the selfish and

the tyranny of evil men..."

JULES (O.S.)

"...blessed is he who, in the name

of charity and good will, shepherded

the weak through the valley of

darkness. And I will strike down

upon thee with great vengeance and

furious anger those who attempt to

poison and destroy my brothers. And

you will know I am the Lord when I

lay my vengeance upon you."

VINCENT (O.S.)

Friend of yours?

JULES (O.S.)

Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

FOURTH MAN

Die... die... die... die...!

FOURTH MAN

I don't understand

VINCENT

Why the fuck didn't you tell us about

that guy in the bathroom? Slip your

mind?  Forget he was in there with a

goddamn hand cannon?

JULES

(to himself)

We should be fuckin' dead right now.

(pause)

Did you see that gun he fired at us?

It was bigger than him.

VINCENT

.357.

JULES

We should be fuckin' dead!

VINCENT

Yeah, we were lucky.

JULES

That shit wasn't luck. That shit was

somethin' else.

VINCENT

Yeah, maybe.

JULES

That was... divine intervention. You

know what divine intervention is?

VINCENT

Yeah, I think so. That means God

came down from Heaven and stopped

the bullets.

JULES

Yeah, man, that's what is means.

That's exactly what it means! God

came down from Heaven and stopped

the bullets.

VINCENT

I think we should be going now.

JULES

Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do

that!  Don't blow this shit off!

What just happened was a fuckin'

miracle!

VINCENT

Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit

happens.

JULES

Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just

happen.

VINCENT

Do you wanna continue this theological

discussion in the car, or at the

jailhouse with the cops?

JULES

We should be fuckin' dead now, my

friend!  We just witnessed a miracle,

and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge

it!

VINCENT

Okay man, it was a miracle, can we

leave now?

VINCENT

...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I

was watchin' it once and this cop

was on it who was talkin' about this

time he got into this gun fight with

a guy in a hallway. He unloads on

this guy and he doesn't hit anything.

And these guys were in a hallway.

It's a freak, but it happens.

JULES

If you wanna play blind man, then go

walk with a Shepherd. But me, my

eyes are wide fuckin' open.

VINCENT

What the fuck does that mean?

JULES

That's it for me. For here on in,

you can consider my ass retired.

VINCENT

Jesus Christ!

JULES

Don't blaspheme!

VINCENT

Goddammit, Jules

JULES

I said don't do that

VINCENT

you're fuckin' freakin' out!

JULES

I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm

through.

VINCENT

While you're at it, be sure to tell

'im why.

JULES

Don't worry, I will.

VINCENT

I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he

laughs his ass off.

JULES

I don't give a damn if he does.

VINCENT

Marvin, what do you make of all this?

MARVIN

I don't even have an opinion.

VINCENT

C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came

down from Heaven and stopped the

bullets?

JULES

What the fuck's happening?

VINCENT

I just accidentally shot Marvin in

the throat.

JULES

Why the fuck did you do that?

VINCENT

I didn't mean to do it. I said it

was an accident.

JULES

I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in

my time

VINCENT

chill out, man, it was an accident,

okay? You hit a bump or somethin'

and the gun went off.

JULES

The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'

bump!

VINCENT

Look! I didn't mean to shoot this

son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went

off, don't ask me how!

JULES

Look at this mess! We're drivin'

around on a city street in broad

daylight

VINCENT

I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'

about the splatter.

JULES

Well you better be thinkin' about it

now, motherfucker! We gotta get this

car off the road. Cops tend to notice

shit like you're driving a car

drenched in fuckin' blood.

VINCENT

Can't we just take it to a friendly

place?

JULES

This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus

don't got no friendly places in the

Valley.

VINCENT

Well, don't look at me, this is your

town, Jules.

VINCENT

Who ya callin'?

JULES

A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

VINCENT

Where's Toluca Lake.

JULES

On the other side of the hill, by

Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass

ain't home, I don't know what the

fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any

other partners in 818.

(into phone)

Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.

(pause)

Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are

in some serious shit. We're in a car

we gotta get off the road, pronto! I

need to use your garage for a couple

hours.

JULES

We gotta be real fuckin' delicate

with this Jimmie's situation. He's

one remark away from kickin' our

asses out the door.

VINCENT

If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

JULES

Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made

a couple phone calls. But I never

want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's

my friend and you don't bust in your

friend's house and start tellin' 'im

what's what.

VINCENT

Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He

kinda freaked out back there when he

saw Marvin.

JULES

Put yourself in his position. It's

eight o'clock in the morning. He

just woke up, he wasn't prepared for

this shit. Don't forget who's doin'

who a favor.

VINCENT

If the price of that favor is I gotta

take shit, he can stick his favor

straight up his ass.

JULES

What the fuck did you just do to his

towel?

VINCENT

I was just dryin' my hands.

JULES

You're supposed to wash 'em first.

VINCENT

You watched me wash 'em.

JULES

I watched you get 'em wet.

VINCENT

I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to

get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,

I coulda done a better job.

JULES

I used the same soap you did and

when I dried my hands, the towel

didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie

pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who

cares? But it's shit like this that's

gonna bring this situation to a boil.

If he were to come in here and see

that towel like that... I'm tellin'

you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause

if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie

on account of you... Look, I ain't

threatenin' you, I respect you an'

all, just don't put me in that

position.

JULES

Jules, you ask me nice like that, no

problem. He's your friend, you handle

him.

JULES

Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious

gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda

been satisfied with freeze-dried

Tasters Choice. You spring this

gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What

flavor is this?

JIMMIE

Knock it off, Julie.

JULES

What?

JIMMIE

I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can

stop butterin' me up. I don't need

you to tell me how good my coffee

is. I'm the one who buys it, I know

how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie

goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy

the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause

when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

But what's on my mind at this moment

isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's

the dead nigger in my garage.

JULES

Jimmie

JIMMIE

I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a

question, Jules. When you drove in

here, did you notice a sign out front

that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

JIMMIE

answer to question. Did you see a

sign out in front of my house that

said, "Dead nigger storage?"

JULES

(playing along)

Naw man, I didn't.

JIMMIE

You know why you didn't see that

sign?

JULES

Why?

JIMMIE

'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my

fuckin' business!

JIMMIE

I ain't through! Now don't you

understand that if Bonnie comes home

and finds a dead body in her house,

I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage

counselor, no trial separation

fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna

get fuckin' divorced. The last time

me an' Bonnie talked about this shit

was gonna be the last time me an'

Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I

wanna help ya out Julie, I really

do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife

doin' it.

JULES

Jimmie

JIMMIE

don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I

can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'

you can say that's gonna make me

forget I love my wife. Now she's

workin' the graveyard shift at the

hospital. She'll be comin' home in

less than an hour and a half. Make

your phone calls, talk to your people,

than get the fuck out of my house.

JULES

That's all we want. We don't wanna

fuck up your shit. We just need to

call our people to bring us in.

JIMMIE

Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's

in my bedroom.

MARSELLUS

...well, say she comes home. Whaddya

think she'll do?

(pause)

No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That

ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,

I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

JULES

You got to appreciate what an

explosive element this Bonnie

situation is. If she comes home from

a hard day's work and finds a bunch

of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'

shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'

what she's apt to do.

MARSELLUS

I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm

doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

JULES

I don't wanna hear about no

motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna

hear from your ass is: "you ain't

got no problems, Jules. I'm on the

motherfucker. Go back in there, chill

them niggers out and wait for the

cavalry, which should be comin'

directly."

MARSELLUS

You ain't got no problems, Jules.

I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in

there, chill them niggers out and

wait for The Wolf, who should be

comin' directly.

JULES

You sendin' The Wolf?

MARSELLUS

Feel better?

JULES

Shit Negro, that's all you had to

say.

THE WOLF

(into phone)

Is she the hysterical type?

(pause)

When she due?

(jotting down)

Give me the principals' names again?

(jots down)

Jules...

"1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head)

Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

THE WOLF

...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

"Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

THE WOLF

Expect a call around 10:30. It's

about thirty minutes away. I'll be

there in ten.

CUT TO:

"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

CUT TO:

THE WOLF

You're Jimmie, right? This is your

house?

JIMMIE

Yeah.

THE WOLF

(stick his hand out)

I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

JIMMIE

Good, 'cause we got one.

THE WOLF

So I heard. May I come in?

JIMMIE

Please do.

THE WOLF

You must be Jules, which would make

you Vincent. Let's get down to brass

tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed

correctly, the clock is ticking, is

that right, Jimmie?

JIMMIE

100%.

THE WOLF

Your wife, Bonnie...

(refers to his pad)

...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is

that correct?

JIMMIE

Uh-huh.

THE WOLF

I was led to believe if she comes

home and finds us here, she wouldn't

appreciate it none too much.

JIMMIE

She won't at that.

THE WOLF

That gives us forty minutes to get

the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you

do what I say when I say it, should

by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a

car, minus a head, in a garage. Take

me to it.

THE WOLF

Jimmie?

JIMMIE

Yes.

THE WOLF

Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I

smelled some coffee in there. Would

you make me a cup?

JIMMIE

Sure, how do you take it?

THE WOLF

Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

THE WOLF

About the car, is there anything I

need to know? Does it stall, does it

make a lot of noise, does it smoke,

is there gas in it, anything?

JULES

Aside from how it looks, the car's

cool.

THE WOLF

Positive?  Don't get me out on the

road and I find out the brake lights

don't work.

JULES

Hey man, as far as I know, the

motherfucker's tip-top.

THE WOLF

Good enough, let's go back to the

kitchen.

THE WOLF

Thank you, Jimmie.

THE WOLF

Okay first thing, you two.

(meaning Jules and

Vincent)

Take the body, stick it in the trunk.

Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty

domesticated house. That would lead

me to believe that in the garage or

under the sink, you got a bunch of

cleansers and cleaners and shit like

that, am I correct?

JIMMIE

Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

THE WOLF

Good. What I need you two fellas to

do is take those cleaning products

and clean the inside of the car. And

I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You

need to go in the backseat, scoop up

all those little pieces of brain and

skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe

down the upholstery  now when it

comes to upholstery, it don't need

to be spic and span, you don't need

to eat off it. Give it a good once

over. What you need to take care of

are the really messy parts. The pools

of blood that have collected, you

gotta soak that shit up.  But the

windows are a different story.  Them

you really clean. Get the Windex, do

a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to

raid your linen closet. I need

blankets, I need comforters, I need

quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker

the better, the darker the better.

No whites, can't use 'em. We need to

camouflage the interior of the car.

We're gonna line the front seat and

the backseat and the floor boards

with quilts and blankets. If a cop

stops us and starts stickin' his big

snout in the car, the subterfuge

won't last. But at a glance, the car

will appear to be normal.  Jimmie

lead the way, boys  get to work.

VINCENT

(calling after him)

A "please" would be nice.

THE WOLF

Come again?

VINCENT

I said a "please" would be nice.

THE WOLF

Set is straight, Buster. I'm not

here to say "please."I'm here to

tell you want to do. And if self-

preservation is an instinct you

possess, you better fuckin' do it

and do it quick. I'm here to help.

If my help's not appreciated, lotsa

luck gentlemen.

JULES

It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your

help is definitely appreciated.

VINCENT

I don't mean any disrespect. I just

don't like people barkin' orders at

me.

THE WOLF

If I'm curt with you, it's because

time is a factor. I think fast, I

talk fast, and I need you guys to

act fast if you want to get out of

this. So pretty please, with sugar

on top, clean the fuckin' car.

THE WOLF

(into phone)

It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

(pause)

White.

(pause)

Nothin', except for the mess inside.

(pause)

About twenty minutes.

(pause)

Nobody who'll be missed.

(pause)

You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.

(he looks at Jimmie)

How we comin', Jimmie?

JIMMIE

Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand

somethin'

THE WOLF

Winston, Jimmie  please, Winston.

JIMMIE

You gotta understand something,

Winston. I want to help you guys out

and all, but that's my best linen.

It was a wedding present from my

Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and

they ain't with us anymore

THE WOLF

let me ask you a question, if you

don't mind?

JIMMIE

Sure.

THE WOLF

Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny

millionaires?

JIMMIE

No.

THE WOLF

Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And

I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and

Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they

would've furnished you with a whole

bedroom set, which your Uncle

Marsellus is more than happy to do.

(takes out a roll of

bills)

I like oak myself, that's what's in

my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,

you an oak man?

JIMMIE

Oak's nice.

JULES

I will never forgive your ass for

this shit. This is some fucked-up

repugnant shit!

VINCENT

Did you ever hear the philosophy

that once a man admits he's wrong,

he's immediately forgiven for all

wrong-doings?

JULES

Man, get outta my face with that

shit! The motherfucker who said that

never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces

of skull with his fingers on account

of your dumb ass.

VINCENT

I got a threshold, Jules. I got a

threshold for the abuse I'll take.

And you're crossin' it. I'm a race

car and you got me in the red. Redline

7000, that's where you are. Just

know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be

drivin' a race car when it's in the

red. It could blow.

JULES

You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a

mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!

Every time my fingers touch brain

I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS

OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker

usta talk about. In fact, what the

fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're

the motherfucker should be on brain

detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'

windows and you're pickin' up this

nigger's skull.

THE WOLF

Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out

of this yet.

JIMMIE

I can't believe that's the same car.

THE WOLF

Well, let's not start suckin' each

other's dicks quite yet. Phase one

is complete, clean the car, which

moves us right along to phase two,

clean you two.

THE WOLF

Strip.

VINCENT

All the way?

THE WOLF

To your bare ass.

THE WOLF

Quickly gentlemen, we got about

fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-

half comes pulling into the driveway.

JULES

This morning air is some chilly shit.

VINCENT

Are you sure this is absolutely

necessary?

THE WOLF

You know what you two look like?

VINCENT

What?

THE WOLF

Like a couple of guys who just blew

off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'

off those bloody rags is absolutely

necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's

garbage bag.

JULES

Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid

like puttin' that out in front of

your house for Elmo the garbage man

to take away.

THE WOLF

Don't worry, we're takin' it with

us. Jim, the soap.

THE WOLF

Okay gentlemen, you're both been to

County before, I'm sure. Here it

comes.

JULES

Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

THE WOLF

Better you than me, gentlemen.

THE WOLF

Don't be afraid of the soap, spread

it around.

THE WOLF

Towel 'em.

THE WOLF

You're dry enough, give 'em their

clothes.

THE WOLF

Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've

planned this better. You guys look

like... what do they look like,

Jimmie?

JIMMIE

Dorks. They look like a couple of

dorks.

JULES

Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,

motherfucker.

JIMMIE

I guess you just gotta know how to

wear them.

JULES

Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert

on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

THE WOLF

C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and

jokin' our way into prison. Don't

make me beg.

THE WOLF

Gentlemen, let's get our rules of

the road straight. We're going to a

place called Monster Joe's Truck and

Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter

Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.

The place is North Hollywood, so a

few twist and turns aside, we'll be

goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll

drive the tainted car. Jules, you

ride with me.  Vincent, you follow

in my Porsche. Now if we cross the

path of any John Q. Laws, nobody

does a fuckin' thing 'til I do

something.

(TO JULES)

What did I say?

JULES

Don't do shit unless

THE WOLF

unless what?

JULES

Unless you do it first.

THE WOLF

Spoken like a true prodigy.

(to Vincent)

How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you

keep your spurs from jingling and

jangling?

VINCENT

I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went

off, I dunno how.

THE WOLF

Fair enough.

(he throws Vince his

car keys)

I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep

up. If I get my car back any different

than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna

be disposing of two bodies.

JULES

We cool?

WINSTON

Like it never happened.

WINSTON

Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all

this will be hers.

RAQUEL

(to the boys)

Hi. You know, if they ever do "I

SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys,

I'd be great.  What's with the

outfits. You guys going to a

volleyball game?

WINSTON

I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.

Maybe I can drop you two off. Where

do you live?

VINCENT

Redondo Beach.

JULES

Inglewood.

WINSTON

(painfully)

It's your future: I see... a cab

ride.

(dropping the act)

Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.

(to Raquel)

Say goodbye, Raquel.

RAQUEL

Goodbye, Raquel.

WINSTON

I'll see you two around, and stay

outta trouble, you crazy kids.

JULES

Mr. Wolf.

JULES

I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

WINSTON

Call me Winston.

WINSTON

You hear that, young lady? Respect.

You could lean a lot from those two

fine specimens. Respect for one's

elders shows character.

RAQUEL

I have character.

WINSTON

Just because you are a character

doesn't mean you have character.

RAQUEL

Oh you're so funny, oh you're so

funny.

JULES

Wanna share a cab?

VINCENT

You know I could go for some

breakfast.  Want to have breakfast

with me?

JULES

Sure.

VINCENT

Thanks a bunch.

(to Jules, who's

nursing his coffee)

Want a sausage?

JULES

Naw, I don't eat pork.

VINCENT

Are you Jewish?

JULES

I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig

on swine.

VINCENT

Why not?

JULES

They're filthy animals. I don't eat

filthy animals.

VINCENT

Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste

good.

JULES

A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin

pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if

it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy

motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in

shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't

wanna eat nothin' that ain't got

enough sense to disregard its own

feces.

VINCENT

How about dogs? Dogs eat their own

feces.

JULES

I don't eat dog either.

VINCENT

Yes, but do you consider a dog to be

a filthy animal?

JULES

I wouldn't go so far as to call a

dog filthy, but they're definitely

dirty. But a dog's got personality.

And personality goes a long way.

VINCENT

So by that rationale, if a pig had a

better personality, he's cease to be

a filthy animal?

JULES

We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one

motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd

have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

VINCENT

Good for you. Lighten up a little.

You been sittin' there all quiet.

JULES

I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

VINCENT

(mouthful of food)

About what?

JULES

The miracle we witnessed.

VINCENT

The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed

a freak occurrence.

JULES

Do you know that a miracle is?

VINCENT

An act of God.

JULES

What's an act of God?

VINCENT

I guess it's when God makes the

impossible possible. And I'm sorry

Jules, but I don't think what happened

this morning qualifies.

JULES

Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't

matter. You're judging this thing

the wrong way. It's not about what.

It could be God stopped the bullets,

he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found

my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge

shit like this based on merit. Whether

or not what we experienced was an

according-to-Hoyle miracle is

insignificant. What is significant

is I felt God's touch, God got

involved.

VINCENT

But why?

JULES

That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I

don't know why. But I can't go back

to sleep.

VINCENT

So you're serious, you're really

gonna quit?

JULES

The life, most definitely.

PATRON

Garcon! Coffee!

VINCENT

So if you're quitting the life,

what'll you do?

JULES

That's what I've been sitting here

contemplating. First, I'm gonna

deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,

basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

VINCENT

What do you mean, walk the earth?

JULES

You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU."

Just walk from town to town, meet

people, get in adventures.

VINCENT

How long do you intend to walk the

earth?

JULES

Until God puts me where he want me

to be.

VINCENT

What if he never does?

JULES

If it takes forever, I'll wait

forever.

VINCENT

So you decided to be a bum?

JULES

I'll just be Jules, Vincent  no

more, no less.

VINCENT

No Jules, you're gonna be like those

pieces of shit out there who beg for

change. They walk around like a bunch

of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in

garbage bins, they eat what I throw

away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got

a word for 'em, they're called bums.

And without a job, residence, or

legal tender, that's what you're

gonna be  a fuckin' bum!

JULES

Look my friend, this is just where

me and you differ

VINCENT

what happened was peculiar  no

doubt about it  but it wasn't water

into wine.

JULES

All shapes and sizes, Vince.

VINCENT

Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

JULES

If you find my answers frightening,

Vincent, you should cease askin'

scary questions.

VINCENT

I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

PUMPKIN

Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY

Any of you fuckin' pricks move and

I'll execute every one of you

motherfuckers!  Got that?!

PUMPKIN

Customers stay seated, waitresses on

the floor.

HONEY BUNNY

Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,

do it or fucking die!

PUMPKIN

You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out

here!  Asta luego!

PUMPKIN

On the floor or I'll cook you ass,

comprende?

MANAGER

I'm the manager here, there's no

problem, no problem at all

PUMPKIN

You're gonna give me a problem?

PUMPKIN

What? You said you're gonna give me

a problem?

MANAGER

No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you

any problem!

PUMPKIN

I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks

like the hero type to me!

HONEY BUNNY

Don't take any chances. Execute him!

MANAGER

Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm

just a coffee shop manager. Take

anything you want.

PUMPKIN

Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll

be all over.

MANAGER

Everybody just be calm and cooperate

with them and this will be all over

soon!

PUMPKIN

Well done, now git your fuckin' ass

on the ground.

PUMPKIN

Okay people, I'm going to go 'round

and collect your wallets. Don't talk,

just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

PUMPKIN

In the bag.

PUMPKIN

What's in that?

JULES

My boss' dirty laundry.

PUMPKIN

You boss makes you do his laundry?

JULES

When he wants it clean.

PUMPKIN

Sounds like a shit job.

JULES

Funny, I've been thinkin' the same

thing.

PUMPKIN

Open it up.

JULES

'Fraid I can't do that.

PUMPKIN

I didn't hear you.

JULES

Yes, you did.

HONEY BUNNY

What's goin' on?

PUMPKIN

Looks like we got a vigilante in our

midst.

HONEY BUNNY

Shoot 'em in the face!

JULES

I don't mean to shatter your ego,

but this ain't the first time I've

had gun pointed at me.

PUMPKIN

You don't open up that case, it's

gonna be the last.

MANAGER

(on the ground)

Quit causing problems, you'll get us

all killed! Give 'em what you got

and get 'em out of here.

JULES

Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat

man, this ain't any of your goddamn

business!

PUMPKIN

I'm countin' to three, and if your

hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna

unload right in your fuckin' face.

Clear? One...

PUMPKIN

...two... three.

JULES

You win.

JULES

It's all yours, Ringo.

PUMPKIN

Open it.

HONEY BUNNY

What is it? What is it?

PUMPKIN

(softly)

Is that what I think it is?

PUMPKIN

It's beautiful.

HONEY BUNNY

Goddammit, what is it?

HONEY BUNNY

Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow

your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!

I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're

gonna fuckin' die bad!

JULES

(to Pumpkin)

Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,

bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

PUMPKIN

Chill out, honey!

HONEY BUNNY

Let him go!

JULES

(softly)

Tell her it's gonna be okay.

PUMPKIN

I'm gonna be okay.

JULES

Promise her.

PUMPKIN

I promise.

JULES

Tell her to chill.

PUMPKIN

Just chill out.

JULES

What's her name?

PUMPKIN

Yolanda.

JULES

(to Yolanda)

So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna

do anything stupid, are we?

YOLANDA

(crying)

Don't you hurt him.

JULES

Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're

gonna be like three Fonzies. And

what' Fonzie like?

JULES

C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

YOLANDA

(through tears, unsure)

He's cool?

JULES

Correct-amundo! And that's what we're

gonna be, we're gonna be cool.

(to Pumpkin)

Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three

and I want you to let go your gun

and lay your palms flat on the table.

But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

JULES

One... two... three.

YOLANDA

Okay, now let him go!

JULES

Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be

cool.  When you yell at me, it makes

me nervous.  When I get nervous, I

get scared. And when motherfuckers

get scared, that's when motherfuckers

get accidentally shot.

YOLANDA

(more conversational)

Just know: you hurt him, you die.

JULES

That seems to be the situation. Now

I don't want that and you don't want

that and Ringo here don't want that.

So let's see what we can do.

(to Ringo)

Now this is the situation. Normally

both of your asses would be dead as

fuckin' fried chicken. But you

happened to pull this shit while I'm

in a transitional period. I don't

wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.

But I'm afraid I can't give you the

case. It don't belong to me. Besides,

I went through too much shit this

morning on account of this case to

just hand it over to your ass.

VINCENT (O.S.)

What the fuck's goin' on here?

JULES

It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't

do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's

cool baby, nothin's changed. We're

still just talkin'.

(to Pumpkin)

Tell her we're still cool.

PUMPKIN

It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still

cool.

VINCENT

(gun raised)

What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

JULES

Nothin' I can't handle. I want you

to just hang back and don't do shit

unless it's absolutely necessary.

VINCENT

Check.

JULES

Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

YOLANDA

I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

JULES

Just hang in there, baby, you're

doing' great, Ringo's proud of you

and so am I.  It's almost over.

(to Pumpkin)

Now I want you to go in that bag and

find my wallet.

PUMPKIN

Which one is it?

JULES

It's the one that says Bad

Motherfucker on it.

JULES

That's my bad motherfucker. Now open

it up and take out the cash. How

much is there?

PUMPKIN

About fifteen hundred dollars.

JULES

Put it in your pocket, it's yours.

Now with the rest of them wallets

and the register, that makes this a

pretty successful little score.

VINCENT

Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen

hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on

general principle.

JULES

You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,

now hang back and shut the fuck up.

Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.

I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.

Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

PUMPKIN

What?

JULES

Your life. I'm givin' you that money

so I don't hafta kill your ass. You

read the Bible?

PUMPKIN

Not regularly.

JULES

There's a passage I got memorized.

Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the

righteous man is beset on all sides

by the inequities of the selfish and

the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is

he who, in the name of charity and

good will, shepherds the weak through

the valley of the darkness. For he

is truly his brother's keeper and

the finder of lost children. And I

will strike down upon thee with great

vengeance and furious anger those

who attempt to poison and destroy my

brothers. And you will know I am the

Lord when I lay my vengeance upon

you." I been sayin' that shit for

years.  And if you ever heard it, it

meant your ass. I never really

questioned what it meant. I thought

it was just a coldblooded thing to

say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped

a cap in his ass. But I saw some

shit this mornin' made me think twice.

Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're

the evil man. And I'm the righteous

man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the

shepherd protecting my righteous ass

in the valley of darkness. Or is

could by you're the righteous man

and I'm the shepherd and it's the

world that's evil and selfish.  I'd

like that. But that shit ain't the

truth. The truth is you're the weak.

And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But

I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to

be a shepherd.

JULES

(to himself)

It's cold.

VINCENT

I think we oughta leave now.

JULES

That's probably a good idea.

wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts,

FADE OUT

THE END
