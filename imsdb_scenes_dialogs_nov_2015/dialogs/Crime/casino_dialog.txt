CASINO

By

Nicholas Pileggi

ACE (V.O.)

When you love someone, you've gotta

trust them. There's no other way.

You've got to give them the key to

everything that's yours.  Otherwise,

what's the point? And, for a while...

I believed that's the kind of love I

had.

ACE (V.O.)

Before I ever ran a casino or got

myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a

hell of a handicapper, I can tell

you that. I was so good, that whenever

I bet, I could change the odds for

every bookmaker in the country. I'm

serious. I had it down so cold that

I was given paradise on earth. I was

given one of the biggest casinos in

Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...

ACE (V.O.)

...by the only kind of guys that can

actually get you that kind of money:

sixty-two million, seven-hundred

thousand dollars. I don't know all

the details.

NICKY (V.O.)

Matter of fact...

NICKY (V.O.)

...nobody knew all the details, but

it should'a been perfect. I mean, he

had me, Nicky Santoro, his best

friend, watching his ass...

NICKY (V.O.)

...and he had Ginger, the woman he

loved, on his arm.  But in the end...

NICKY (V.O.)

...we fucked it all up. It should'a

been so sweet, too.  But it turned

out to be the last time that street

guys like us were ever given anything

that fuckin' valuable again.

ACE (V.O.)

At that time, Vegas was a place where

millions of suckers flew in every

year on their own nickel, and left

behind about a billion dollars. But

at night, you couldn't see the desert

that surrounds Las Vegas...

ACE (V.O.)

But it's in the desert where lots of

the town's problems are solved.

NICKY (V.O.)

Got a lot of holes in the desert,

and a lot of problems are buried in

those holes. Except you gotta do it

right. I mean, you gotta have the

hole already dug before you show up

with a package in the trunk.

Otherwise you're talkin' about a

half-hour or forty-five minutes of

diggin'. And who knows who's gonna

be comin' along in that time? Before

you know it, you gotta dig a few

more holes. You could be there all

fuckin' night.

ACE (V.O.)

Who could resist? Anywhere else in

the country, I was a bookie, a

gambler, always lookin' over my

shoulder, hassled by cops, day and

night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam

Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate,

but running a casino. And that's

like selling dreams for cash.

ACE (V.O.)

I hired an old casino pal, Billy

Sherbert, as my manager and I went

to work.

SHERBERT

(Introducing the EXECS

to ACE)

...And this is Ronnie, who takes

care of the card room...

ACE (V.O.)

For guys like me, Las Vegas washes

away your sins. It's a morality car

wash. It does for us what Lourdes

does for humpbacks and cripples.

And, along with making us legit...

ACE (V.O.)

...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean,

what do you think we're doing out

here in the middle of the desert?

It's all this money. This is the end

result of all the bright lights and

the comped trips, of all the champagne

and free hotel suites, and all the

broads and all the booze. It's all

been arranged just for us to get

your money. That's the truth about

Las Vegas.

ACE (V.O.)

We're the only winners. The players

don't stand a chance. And their cash

flows from the tables to our boxes

...through the cage and into the

most sacred room in the casino ...the

place where they add up all the money

...the holy of holies ...the count

room.

ACE (V.O.)

Now this place was off limits.

COUNTER #1

Verify two thousand.

ACE (V.O.)

Even I couldn't get inside, but it

was my job to keep it filled with

cash. That's for sure.

NICKY (V.O.)

They had so much fuckin' money in

there, you could build a house out

of stacks of $100 bills. And the

best part was that upstairs, the

board of directors didn't know what

the fuck was going on.

COUNTER #2

Five thousand.

NICKY (V.O.)

I mean, to them everything looked on

the up and up. Right? Wrong.

COUNTER #1

Verify five thousand.

NICKY (V.O.)

The guys inside the counting room...

COUNT ROOM EXEC

Five thousand.

NICKY (V.O.)

...were all slipped in there to skim

the joint dry.  They'd do short

counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd

even take cash right out of the drop

boxes. And it was up to this guy

right here [NANCE], standin' in front

of about two million dollars, to

skim the cash off the top without

anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or

anybody.

COUNTER #1

Verify two hundred.

NICKY (V.O.)

Now, notice how in the count room

nobody ever seems to see anything.

Somehow, somebody's always lookin'

the other way. Now, look at these

guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy,

right?  They're countin' money. Who

wants to bother them? I mean, God

forbid they should make a mistake

and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're

in and you're out.

NICKY

Past the jag-off guard who gets an

extra c-note a week just to watch

the door.  I mean, it's routine.

Business as usual: in, out, hello,

goodbye. And that's all there is to

it. Just another fat fuck walkin'

out of the casino with a suitcase.

Now, that suitcase was goin' straight

to one place: right to Kansas City

...which was as close to Las Vegas

as the Midwest bosses could go without

gettin' themselves arrested.

NICKY (V.O.)

That suitcase was all the bosses

ever wanted ...and they wanted it

every month.

PISCANO

Hey, John, how are you? How was your

ride?

NICKY (V.O.)

Now this old Mormon fuck here...

CUT TO: NANCE, AS HE GETS OUT OF PISCANO'S CAR

NICKY (V.O.)

...he had to fly in with suitcases

once a month, nice and easy.

NANCE

Somethin' smells good.

PISCANO

Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.

NICKY (V.O.)

The bosses would come from all over

the place: Detroit, Cleveland,

Milwaukee. All over the Midwest.

And they would meet in the back of

this produce market in Kansas City.

I mean, nobody even knew.

NICKY (V.O.)

One of the guys made his mother do

all the cooking.

BORELLI

Did you ever see that guy Jerry

Steriano?

FORLANO

Jerry Steriano?

BORELLI

Yeah.

NICKY (V.O.)

Now, these old greaseballs might not

look it, but believe me, these are

the guys who secretly controlled Las

Vegas.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

That man's here again.

NICKY (V.O.)

Because they controlled the Teamsters'

Union, and that's where you had to

go if you wanted to borrow money to

buy a casino.

BORELLI (O.S.)

When you've finished with him, I

want him.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

(Carrying a plate of

food to the table

where BORELLI and

FORLANO are seated.)

Here you are, gentlemen.

NICKY (V.O.)

And nobody got a Teamsters' loan,

unless the guys in this room knew

they were gonna get their little

suitcases.

NICKY (V.O.)

Guys like this antique here [FORLANO],

out of Detroit. Or especially guys

like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top

boss.

GAGGI

You got a round figure on it?

NICKY (V.O.)

Definitely the most important guy in

this room.

NANCE

(Picking up the

suitcase)

About twenty pounds.

GAGGI

So?

NANCE

That's around seven hundred thousand.

GAGGI

Uh-huh, good.

ANDY STONE

(Off-screen, from

following scene)

I know it's a little early for Las

Vegas...

STONE (O.S.)

...but I do want to welcome the ladies

and gentlemen of the gaming industry.

ACE (V.O.)

As far as the world was concerned

Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters'

Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.

STONE

This is a very auspicious occasion.

ACE (V.O.)

A powerful man.

STONE

Philip, if you would rise.

ACE (V.O.)

He even played golf with the

President.

STONE

On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension

Fund, it is my pleasure to present

to you . . .

ACE (V.O.)

But Andy also took orders. And when

he was told to give a pension fund

loan to Philip Green...

STONE

(Handing GREEN a large

cardboard facsimile

'check')

...this check for $62,700,000 for

the new Tangiers.

GREEN

Thank you.

ACE (V.O.)

...he did what he was told.

NICKY (V.O.)

Now here was the perfect front man.

I mean, what the fuck else could he

be?  He didn't know too much. He

didn't want to know too much,

especially that the bosses made the

Teamsters lend him the money. He

wanted to believe the Teamsters gave

him all that fuckin' money 'cause he

was smart.

GREEN

...I say that, knowing full well

just how much competition we have in

this great city.

NICKY (V.O.)

And where they got Green from - who

the fuck knows?  All I know is that

Green was an Arizona real estate

hustler, who barely had enough gas

money to come and pick up his own

fuckin' check...

NICKY (V.O.)

Now, all they needed was somebody

they could trust to run the casino.

And who better than Ace?  I mean, he

was already in Vegas a couple of

years and he had the fuckin' place

clocked.

NICKY (V.O.)

But typical Ace...

NICKY (V.O.)

...give him a shot at runnin' a casino

and he tries to talk you out of it.

ACE

You know, I don't know if I could do

this even if I wanted to. The Gaming

Commission would never give me a

license. I have at least two dozen

gambling and bookmaking pinches on

me.

STONE

You don't have to have a license to

work in a casino. All you gotta do

is apply for one. The state law says

you can work in a casino while they're

processing your application. They

got a ten-year backlog.

ACE

But what happens when they do find

out?

STONE

Why would they want to find out?

We're puttin' a hundred million into

this desert here. Why would they

want to lock us out?  And besides,

they'll never find out. All you gotta

do is keep changing your job title.

Like, uh, from Casino Executive to

Food and Beverage Chairman. And what

happens it, they take your

application, they put it at the bottom

of the pile. I know guys workin'

there for thirty years, don't have a

license.

ACE

(Exhales)

It's a tough proposition, Andy. You,

you know, if I did it, I'd have to

run it my way.

STONE

You got it.

ACE

I'm serious. No interference.

STONE

Nobody's gonna interfere with your

running the casino. I guarantee it.

NICKY (V.O.)

And that's how that got Ace to take

over.

NICKY (V.O.)

They wanted him because Ace ate,

slept and breathed gambling.

NICKY (V.O.)

They worked out a real cute job title

too.

NICKY (V.O.)

Tangiers Public Relations Director.

NICKY (V.O.)

But the only thing he ever directed

was the casino. He made his first

bet when he was fifteen years old,

and he always made money. But he

didn't bet like you or me.

NICKY (V.O.)

You know, havin' some fun with it,

shit like that.

ACE

(Approaching the DEALER)

Where the hell did you learn how to

deal?

(He reaches down,

stacking and arranging

the chips.)

NICKY (V.O.)

He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.

ACE

(To the chastised

DEALER)

Place the checks properly. That's

the way you do it.

DEALER

Yes, sir.

NICKY (V.O.)

He had to know everything, this guy.

NICKY (V.O.)

He'd find out the kind of inside

stuff nobody else knew, and that's

what he'd put his money on.

NICKY (V.O.)

Even back home, years ago, when we

were first hangin' out together...

NICKY (V.O.)

...he'd know if the quarterback was

on coke.

ACE

I'll take Columbia for twenty.

NICKY (V.O.)

If his girlfriend was knocked up.

LUCKY LARRY

Twenty dimes on Columbia . . .

NICKY (V.O.)

He'd get the wind velocity so he

could judge the field goals. He even

figured out the different bounce you

got off the different kinds of wood

they used on college basketball

courts, you know?

NICKY (V.O.)

He'd be workin' on this shit day and

night. There was nothin' about a

game he was gonna bet that he didn't

know.

GAMBLER #1

(Into phone)

Ace got down at six.

GAMBLER #2

(Into phone)

Charlie, hey. Rothstein got six.

NICKY (V.O.)

Season after season, the prick was

the only guaranteed winner I ever

knew. But he was so serious about it

all that I don't think he ever enjoyed

himself.  But...

NICKY (V.O.)

...that's just the way he was.

NICKY (V.O.)

But back then the bosses didn't give

a fuck about whether he enjoyed

himself of not. To them, he was a

cash register. All they had to do

was ring the bell and take the money.

Especially Remo, who was a fuckin'

degenerate gambler who always lost.

GAGGI

(Slams down his cards

and curses at his

losing hands)

Ma che cazzo!

NICKY (V.O.)

I mean, unless Ace made his bet.

GAGGI

That's enough now!

OLD MAN CAPO

I can't contest the cards.

GAGGI

Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American

slang for 'Fuck off']

(Summoning a young

man.)

Johnny!

NICKY (V.O.)

Ace made more money for them on a

weekend than I could do heisting

joints for a month.

NICKY (V.O.)

Whatever Ace picked up on the street

he told Remo.

NICKY

(Walks over to ACE

and whispers)

Hey, did you bring that thing?

NICKY (V.O.)

You know, I mean fixed fights, doped

horses, crooked fuckin' zebras...

locked-in point spreads. He told

fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell

you the truth. I don't blame him.

GAGGI

Ace.

NICKY (V.O.)

Keepin' Remo happy with money was

the greatest insurance policy in the

world.

GAGGI

Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you

get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever

had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd

you do it?

ACE

Well, that's why they paid so well.

GAGGI

You see?

(Chuckles.)

Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do

we got on for next week?

ACE

Well, it's a little too early. I'd

say Thursday would be good. I'll

know by then. Is that all right?

GAGGI

Okay. You come by the house?

ACE

I'll come by.

GAGGI

Seven o'clock?

ACE

Seven o'clock.

GAGGI

Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay,

Ace?

GAGGI

(To NICKY)

Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian-

American slang for 'Come here']

NICKY

(To ACE)

I'll be right out.

GAGGI

T'aggia parla. [Italian-American

slang for 'I've got to talk to you']

Nicky... See that guy?

(pointing to the off-

screen ACE)

NICKY

Mm.

GAGGI

Keep a good eye on him. He's makin'

a lot of money for us. And he's gonna

continue makin' a lot of money for

us, so keep a good eye on him.

NICKY

Mm.

GAGGI

Not like your fuckin' friends out

there, that... without brains.  Okay?

NICKY

All right.

GAGGI

Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian-

American slang for 'I'm counting on

you']

NICKY

Yeah.

GAGGI

Fine.

NICKY

(Reaching down to

touch GAGGI's money,

joking with him.)

Want me to take this for you?

(He walks out.)

NICKY (V.O.)

So, now, on top of everything else,

I gotta make sure that nobody fucks

around with the Golden Jew.

JOE

(To the BARTENDER)

Chase, couple of shooters for the

ladies.

BARTENDER (O.S.)

All right.

ACE (V.O.)

Yeah, we made a great pair. I made

book and Nicky made sure we always

collected. The old men loved us. And

why not? They all made money with

us.

NICKY

(To MARINO)

They payin'?

ACE (V.O.)

How did Nicky collect?

MARINO

They pay every week, like they're

supposed to.

ACE (V.O.)

Don't ask.

NICKY

Then where the fuck is the money? I

don't see the money.

ACE

Hi, Melissa. Heidi.

BLONDE

Hi, Sam.

JOE

(To the GIRLS)

Who's this guy?

MARINO

(To NICKY)

Get the fuck out of here. It was

nine. I laid nine.

NICKY

It was eight.  Ace... tell him the

line on the Bear's game.

ACE

Eight.

NICKY

If he don't know, nobody knows. Told

you it was eight.

MARINO

Well, how come I laid nine?

NICKY

'Cause you're a jag-off. I would

have fuckin' made you lay ten...

ACE

(To JOE)

Excuse me.

JOE

What?

ACE

(He holds up the pen)

Is this yours? Your pen?

JOE

Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

ACE

I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just

didn't know whose it was. I thought

it was yours. I didn't want it to

get lost.

JOE

Well, thank you. Why don't you take

that fuckin' pen and shove it up you

ass, you fuckin' jag-off?

ACE

Well, I was just offering you the-

JOE

(Turning his back to

talk to the girls,

referring to ACE)

This fuckin' asshole.

MAN #1

(To JOE)

Look out!

MAN #1

Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out!

NICKY

What's that? You hear? You hear a

little girl, Frankie? You hear a

little girl, Ace? Is that a little

fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the

fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend

stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?!

Huh?!

ACE

(Over whimpers and

pants)

Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta-

take it easy.

ACE (V.O.)

While I was tryin' to figure out why

the guy was sayin' what he was sayin',

Nicky just hit him. No matter how

big a guy might be, Nicky would take

him on. You beat Nicky with fists,

he comes back with a bat. You beat

him with a knife, he comes back with

a gun. And you beat him with a gun,

you better kill him, because he'll

keep comin' back and back until one

of you is dead.

NICKY (V.O.)

Listen...

NICKY (V.O.)

...with me protecting Ace, he made a

fortune for the bosses. I mean that's

what got him to Vegas. He was a money

machine. A tremendous earner for

these guys.  As soon as he took over,

he doubled the fuckin' drop. With

Ace the casino never saw so much

money. And the bosses, they couldn't

be happier.

ACE (V.O.)

In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-

in local cowboys working. They were

close to the, you know, good old

boys.

ACE

(To SHERBERT)

Pay him six hundred a week, tell him

to walk around and look smart.

ACE (V.O.)

I mean, without us, these guys, they'd

still be shovellin' mule shit.

ACE

Ward, you gotta keep a cleaner

station. If you need 'Mr Clean',

page him, all right?

WARD

It won't happen again, Sam.

ACE

Mr Rothstein.

ACE

(To SHERBERT)

Is this guy just another dumb fuckin'

white man, or what? What's his story?

SHERBERT

We need this guy.

ACE

We can't get rid of him?

SHERBERT

He's juiced in. He's the County

Commissioner's cousin.

ACE

I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

ACE (V.O.)

These yokels ran the state.

DEALER #1

Thank you very much, Senator.

ACE (V.O.)

They passed the laws, they owned the

courts.

SENATOR

Hi, Ace.

ACE

Hello, Senator.

SENATOR

(To ACE)

Hey, I need a room. Need a room.

ACE

Good to see ya.

(To SHERBERT)

William would you...

ACE (V.O.)

I had dozens of politicians and state

officials comin' through that place

every week.

SHERBERT

Nice to see you, Senator.

ACE

(To SHERBERT)

Help the Senator, give him whatever

he wants.

SHERBERT

Certainly.

(Leads the way.)

Senator.

ACE (V.O.)

Why not make them happy?

SHERBERT

We have some nice penthouses you'll

enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.

ACE (V.O.)

For politicians...

ACE (V.O.)

...like our state senator up there,

everything was on the house.

ACE (V.O.)

These guys won their comped life

when they got elected. So, hey, why

not take advantage of it? Still, the

politicians come cheap. We could

handle them.

ACE (V.O.)

It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa,

who plays thirty thousand dollars a

hand in baccarat. That's the one you

really gotta watch.

ACE (V.O.)

He plays fast and big and he has the

cash and the credit to turn out your

lights. About a year ago, he cleaned

out a couple of casinos in the Cayman

Islands.

ACE (V.O.)

Downstairs, he takes us for two

million... and upstairs he takes

free soap, shampoo and towels. Another

billionaire cheapskate who loves his

free rooms...

ACE (V.O.)

...free private jets, and two million

of our money.

ACE

Nice to see you again.

ACE (V.O.)

But we got him back. I had our pilot

tell him the plane was on the fritz.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHERBERT

Ken, I don't know what the hell went

wrong. I'm awfully sorry.

ICHIKAWA

This is a big problem. Big problem.

SHERBERT

I can't understand it. These

mechanical things, you know, they

happen. Hey, be-better here than

(gesturing to the sky)

up there, you know what I mean?

ACE (V.O.)

Then he missed the commercial flights

connecting with Japan.

AGENT

I'm so sorry. There's a convention

in town, and all flights are booked.

SHERBERT

A convention?

(Turning to ICHIKAWA)

I can't believe that there's a

convention. It's never... ?

ICHIKAWA

What can I do?

ACE (V.O.)

We got him back ...with a whole floor

of rooms for himself.

ACE

I'm sorry you missed the plane.

ICHIKAWA

You want to get my money back, right?

(Chuckles)

ACE

No, no, no. No gambling. No.

ACE (V.O.)

He bet one thousand a hand instead

of his usual thirty thousand a hand.

DEALER

The bank wins a natural eight over a

five.

ACE (V.O.)

But I knew, the trick with whales

like Ichikawa was that they can't

bet small for long. He didn't think

of it as winning ten thousand, he

thought of it as losing ninety

thousand.

ACE (V.O.)

So, he upped his bets...

ACE (V.O.)

...until he dropped his winnings

back and gave up a million of his

own cash.

DISSOLVE TO:

ACE (V.O.)

In the casino, the cardinal rule is

to keep them playing...

ACE (V.O.)

...and keep them coming back. The

longer they play, the more they lose.

In the end, we get it all.

ACE (V.O.)

In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch

everybody else.

DEALER

Six, an easy way. Six! All right,

who's gonna give me...

ACE (V.O.)

Since the players are looking to

beat the casino...

DEALER

...both dice must hit that back wall

each and every roll. All right, make

a six!

ACE (V.O.)

...the dealers are watching the

players.

WOMAN

Gimme a six!

DEALER

Come on, baby, make a six!

ACE (V.O.)

The box men are watching the dealers.

DEALER

(Humming, fielding,

every roll.)

ACE (V.O.)

The floor men are watching the box

men.

ACE (V.O.)

The pit bosses are watching the floor

men.

ACE (V.O.)

The shift bosses are watching the

pit bosses.

ACE (V.O.)

The casino manager is watching the

shift bosses.

ACE (V.O.)

I'm watching the casino manager.

ACE (V.O.)

And the eye-in-the-sky is watching

us all.

ACE (V.O.)

Plus...

ACE (V.O.)

...we had a dozen guys up there,

most of them ex-cheats, who knew

every trick in the house.

HIGH ROLLER

Come on, come on.

GINGER

Yes!

HIGH ROLLER

Thank you. Very nice.

GINGER

(Chuckles)

I told you I was hot tonight.

HIGH ROLLER

(Off-screen)

Let's go. This is for Ginger. Come

on. This is for Ginger.

GAMBLER #1

Let me have a hundred on the hard

ten. Thank you.

GAMBLER #2

Hard ten. One hundred.

HIGH ROLLER

I'm sorry.

GINGER

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

(To the table)

Thank you very much. Thank you very

much.

GINGER

Thank you, sir, I appreciate that.

Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips

as tips to the dealer and box man.

Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances

and drive fast.

HIGH ROLLER

Ginger, honey.

DEALER

Thank you very much, now.

HIGH ROLLER

Ginger, honey, this is for you love.

Thanks for your time.

GINGER

(Chuckles)

Come on.

HIGH ROLLER

What's the matter?

GINGER

What do you mean, 'What's the matter?'

I made a lot of money for you. I

want my cut.

HIGH ROLLER

What money? I've seen you stealing

from me.

GINGER

What money?  Look at this stack of

chips. Don't give me that shit. I

want my end.

HIGH ROLLER

Ginger, I've been watching you all

night. You've been stealing from me.

GINGER

Don't give me that shit. I want my

money.

HIGH ROLLER

That bag's full of fuckin' chips you

GINGER

(Interrupts)

What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't

steal anything from you.

HIGH ROLLER

Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!

GINGER

Get lost?

HIGH ROLLER

Yes.

GINGER

Get lost?

HIGH ROLLER

Yes.

GINGER

Well, how 'bout that?

HIGH ROLLER

Come on!

(He bends down to

pick them up.)

ACE (V.O.)

What a move. I fell in love right

there.

ACE (V.O.)

But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger,

love costs money.

GINGER

I'm going to go powder my nose.

(ACE hands GINGER a

single $50 bill. She

smiles coyly. He

hands her another

fifty.)

ACE (V.O.)

Ginger's mission in life was money.

GINGER

I'll be right back.

ACE (O.S.)

(from following scene)

See you, Ginger.

GINGER

Okay, thank you for asking.

ACE (V.O.)

She was a queen around the casino.

She brought in high rollers and helped

them spread around a lot of money.

GINGER

(To VALET PARKERS)

Hello.

VALET PARKER

Hey, Ginger, how you doin'?

GINGER

Great.

(Handing the VALET

some money.)

And I have something for you. You

got me covered?

VALET PARKER

Yes. Something for you, there.

GINGER

And you do. Thank you very much.

VALET PARKER

Take care of yourself.

GINGER

I got some lucky pills for you, honey.

HIGH ROLLER #2

Oh, yeah?

ACE (V.O.)

Who didn't want Ginger? She was one

of the best-known, best-liked and

most respected hustlers in town.

Smart hustlers like her could keep a

guy awake for two or three days before

sending him home broke to the little

woman and his bank examiners.

ACE

Any change?

GINGER

(Chuckles)

I hit a few... uh, games on the way

back.

ACE (V.O.)

That was all bullshit. She just

pocketed the cash.

GINGER

(To CASHIER)

How you doin' tonight?

CASHIER

Good. How are you?

GINGER

(Sighing)

Oh, beat.

ACE (V.O.)

Ginger had the hustler's code.

CASHIER

Okay.

GINGER

Take one for you.

CASHIER

(While she counts out

the cash)

Thank you.

ACE (V.O.)

She knew how to take care of people.

And that's what Vegas was all about.

CASHIER

(As she pushes a stack

of $100 bills across

the counter)

Sixty-eight hundred.

GINGER

Thanks

CASHIER

You're welcome.

ACE (V.O.)

It's Kickback City.

GINGER

You have a good night.

CASHIER

Thank you. You too.

ACE (V.O.)

She took care of the dealers...

GINGER

Hey, Mitch.

ACE (V.O.)

...pit bosses, floor managers.

GINGER

Thank you.

ACE (V.O.)

But mostly...

ACE (V.O.)

...she took care of the valet parkers,

the guys who could get you anything

and take care of anything.

GINGER

Thanks a lot.

SHIFT BOSS

Thank you, Ginger.

ACE (V.O.)

Ginger took care of the parkers

because they took care of the security

guards, who took care of the metro

cops, who let her operate.

VALET PARKER #3

Thank you, Ginger.

GINGER

(Getting into her car)

I need that stuff tonight.

VALET PARKER #3

No problem.

GINGER

You're a doll.

ACE (V.O.)

The valet parking job was such a

money-maker that they had to pay off

the hotel manager just to get the

concession.

ACE (V.O.)

But one thing I could never

understand, was that she could have

everything under control, except for

her old pimp boyfriend, Lester

Diamond.

LESTER

Look, Gin, you know I got other people

in this. I got partners. But I want

you to understand that I am lookin'

out for you in this thing.  Okay?

You're going to get yours back...

and you're gonna get it back first.

Okay?

GINGER

All right.

LESTER

Okay?

GINGER

Yeah.

LESTER

Where are you goin'? Where are you?

You're in that place. Where are you?

GINGER

I'm here.

LESTER

No, you're not. Where are you? Where

are you?

GINGER

I'm always here for you.

LESTER

You are.

GINGER

I am.

ACE (V.O.)

The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look

at this creep.

GINGER

Good luck.

LESTER

Yeah.

ACE (V.O.)

He was a moocher, a card cheat, a

country-club golf hustler. A

scumbag... chasing dentists for a

few bucks.

GINGER

Careful.

ACE (V.O.)

I mean, the guy was always broke, he

always had a story. And somehow, she

could never turn him down. The way

Ginger saw it, I guess, was that

Lester was just an unlucky guy.

Somebody had to take care of him.

ACE (V.O.)

But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

NICKY

(To customs agent)

You find any cash in there, we'll

whack it up with you.

ACE (V.O.)

I mean, he took care of himself only

too well. And that's why every badge

back home wanted to nail him.

JENNIFER

(To customs agent)

Excuse me, but I folded these things

beautifully and I would appreciate a

little respect. Jesus Christ!

NICKY

Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live

with her.

ACE (V.O.)

Even after a little vacation, they

hassled him at the airport.

COP #1

(To MARINO)

Excuse me.

ACE (V.O.)

I mean, Frank Marino was there to

meet him, but so were the cops. This

time they wanted to pinch him for

some diamond burglary in Antwerp.

JENNIFER

Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these,

please?

ACE (V.O.)

They were ready to blame him for

anything, no matter where it happened.

JENNIFER

(To LITTLE NICKY)

You go and put your things away.

ACE (V.O.)

And they were usually right.

MARINO

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

NICKY

Hold it, hold it. Here.

ACE (V.O.)

Because Nicky enjoyed being a

gangster, and he didn't give a damn

who knew it.

JENNIFER

Come on. There we go. Look at that.

Beautiful.

ACE (V.O.)

I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause

it turns out Nicky was about to be

sent to Vegas.

JENNIFER

All right, we're clear.

NICKY

There's more!

JENNIFER

I think that's it.

NICKY

There's more! There's a couple stuck

in there. I know there's more.

JENNIFER

God, I'm telling you, they're out!

NICKY

Come on, damn it. Don't get so

defensive. It could be stuck in your

hair, you know.

JENNIFER

Look, there aren't...

(A diamond falls out

of her beehive.)

There aren't but...

NICKY

Oh, there aren't?

(Showing her the

diamond.)

What's that?

(Slaps her.)

Huh? What's that.

(FRANK chuckles.)

There's no more. Thanks, hon.

NICKY (V.O.)

I couldn't wait to get my hands on

Vegas. But the bosses didn't send me

out there to have a good time.

NICKY (V.O.)

They sent me out there to make sure

that nobody fucked with Ace and...

NICKY (V.O.)

...nobody interfered with the fuckin'

skim.

ACE

(Opening door)

Hey.

JENNIFER

Hey, how you doin'?

(Kisses ACE.)

NICKY

Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?

JENNIFER

(Whispering)

Wow.

NICKY

Boy, look at this place, huh?

JENNIFER

Incredible.

NICKY

All right.

ACE

Welcome to Vegas.

NICKY

Okay, Sammy.

ACE

Somethin', huh?

NICKY

Yeah.

ACE

(Calling her over)

Ginger.

NICKY

(To ACE)

Holy shit, what've you been doin'

out here?

ACE

Honey, come here.

ACE

This is Jennifer and Nick. They're

dear friends of mine.

JENNIFER

(Shaking hands)

Good to meet you.

GINGER

Hi, Jennifer.

NICKY

Pleasure.

(Grasping GINGER's

hand and kissing it.)

Very nice to meet you.

GINGER

Hi, how are you?

NICKY

Okay, Sammy.

ACE (V.O.)

After we ate, we left Jennifer and

Ginger alone and we took a ride to

talk. And then... he hit me with it.

NICKY

What do you think about me movin'

out here?

(ACE looks away.)

What's the matter? You got a problem

with that?

ACE

No, of course not.

NICKY

(Playfully)

You mean, I have your permission?

ACE

Sure, you have my permission. But I -

I just gotta tell you it's no joke

out here. It's no joke, you know?

You gotta keep a low profile. It's

not like back home. Right off the

bat, they don't like guys like us.

And this sheriff's a real cowboy.

Even the coppers aren't afraid to

bury people out in the desert here.

NICKY

I don't care. I want to get away

from back home for a while. I'm tired

of that shit back there.

(Referring to the

Vegas lights.)

Look at this place. It's made of

money. You know what the best part

is? Nobody's gonna know what we're

doin'! There's nobody here to see

us! Everybody's back home.

ACE

Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched

twice for no reason. You really gotta

be careful. I'm running a licensed

place. Everything's legit.

NICKY

Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna

do anything. What am I gonna do?

I'm especially not gonna involve you

in anything.

NICKY (V.O.)

Ace saw Vegas one way.

NICKY

You call this guy and tell him I'm

comin'?

MARINO

Of course.

NICKY (V.O.)

But I saw it another. I saw it as

untouched. I mean, they had bookies,

pimps and drug dealers I could shake

down. Who the fuck were they gonna

run to?  So, I started getting

everybody in line. Best of all, for

the first time in my life, I figured

out a way not to lose.

ACE (V.O.)

Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme,

all right. It wasn't very scientific

but it worked. When he won, he

collected. When he lost, he told the

bookies to go fuck themselves. What

were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?

(Chuckles.)

Nicky was the muscle.

NICKY

Tony.

TONY

Hey.

NICKY

How you doin'?

TONY

How you doin'?

NICKY

All right, yeah. You got that thing

for me?

TONY

What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought

you was layin'.

NICKY

I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it.

I was takin' it.

TONY

You sure?

NICKY

I'm positive.

TONY

Well, I'm a little confused here.

NICKY

You're a little confused?

TONY

Yeah.

NICKY

(Pointing to a window,

above a counter with

a tiny opening to

talk through)

Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face

through this window over here like,

you know, you'll - you'll get

unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!

TONY

(Groaning)

I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean

anything by it.

NICKY

Yeah, I know, that's why you had it

ready. You thought I was fuckin'

layin' it?!

TONY

(Gasps)

My fuckin' head.

NICKY

Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck

around, Tony.

MARINO

(Pointing to TONY)

Smarten up.

NICKY

(Walking out)

You jag-off.

CLASSROOM NUN (O.S.)

(From following scene)

And now...

CLASSROOM NUN

...Nicholas Santoro will come up and

tell us about our first president.

LITTLE NICKY

(Stepping up in front

of the class to begin

a speech)

George Washington was born in a...

ACE (V.O.)

But still, it was nice and quiet for

a while. Ginger and I presented Nicky

and Jennifer all over town, like

regular Ozzie and Harriets.

LITTLE NICKY

...typical Virginia farmhouse.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

(To LITTLE NICKY)

Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.

NICKY (V.O.)

Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved

with Little League, and it was great.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Now, I want you to get out there and

get me singles and doubles, okay?

'Cause that's what's gonna win this

game.

NICKY (V.O.)

Turned out to be one of the other

coaches was a fuckin'...

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Now go out there and show your dad

what you can do.

NICKY (V.O.)

...metro intelligence cop. But it

didn't matter. I mean, it was all

about the kids, you know.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

You know, he's gotta realize

everything can't be a home run that

he does.

NICKY

Yeah, well, that's exactly what I

keep tellin' him, but that's the

kind of kid he is ever since he's

born.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

It's instinctive, you know.

NICKY

He tries to do everything...

NICKY

Ohh!

ACE (V.O.)

And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his

presence known.

ACE (V.O.)

Especially at the casino, where he

definitely did not work, people got

the message.

NICKY (V.O.)

Me? That's why the bosses sent me

out here. They wanted me to make

sure none of the other crews robbed

the joint. Like these two fuckin'

balloon-heads over here [EDDY and

JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang

us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?

(Chuckling.)

Yeah, right, I'm sure.

JERRY

(Shakes NICKY's hand)

Hey, Nicky. How are you?

NICKY

Hey, Eddy.

EDDY

Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are

you doin' here?

NICKY

I'm over here now.

JERRY/EDDY

(In unison)

You're over here?

JERRY

You're over here?

NICKY

Yeah, I'm over here with him.

EDDY

Oh.

JERRY

Oh.

EDDY

We're waiting on Carmine.

JERRY

Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.

NICKY

Carmine? He was here before. I saw

him. He had a suitcase and everything,

and then he left.

EDDY

Carmine left?

NICKY

Uh-huh.

JERRY

Carmine left?

EDDY

He's gone?

JERRY

He's not here?

EDDY

Carmine's gone.

NICKY

I think, you know, maybe he went

across the street or somewhere else

or somethin'. I don't know.

EDDY

Well, listen, uh... Good luck with

the joint, huh?

(Shakes hands with

NICKY.)

NICKY

Oh, thanks, Eddy.

JERRY

(Shakes NICKY's hand)

Yeah, lots of luck. Lots of luck.

NICKY

Hey, great, Jerry.

NICKY

Good luck to you too.

CREDIT CLERK

(To NICKY from behind

the cage)

Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.

NICKY

What?

CREDIT CLERK

They forgot to sign their papers.

NICKY

Yeah, they don't need those anymore.

ACE (V.O.)

Out of respect, guys from other crews

got away with a warning.

ACE (V.O.)

Everybody else: watch out.

ACE (V.O.)

Like these yokels here who never

heard of Nicky or the bosses back

home, 'cause they're the morons who

give you the most trouble. Even after

we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin'

back with beards and wigs and fake

noses.

ACE (V.O.)

You can spot these assholes by

watching the way they bet. Like this

guy. He's bettin' lavender chips at

five hundred each with only one little

problem. He's always guessed right.

If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd

have been tougher to spot. But in

the end, they're all greedy.

ACE (V.O.)

I saw that the dealer was weak, but

he wasn't in on it.

ACE (V.O.)

He just wasn't protecting his hand.

He was lifting his hole card way to

high.

ACE (V.O.)

Now, here's this guy...

ACE (V.O.)

...reading the dealer's hole card...

ACE (V.O.)

...and signaling his buddy [the

WINNER] at this table.

ACE (V.O.)

And that's just what these hustlers

look for. They cruise from casino to

casino, lookin' for weak dealers the

way lions look for weak antelope.

ACE (O.S.)

(From following scene)

Operator?

ACE

This is Mr R. Get me Armstrong and

Friday over at pit two right away.

ACE

(To ARMSTRONG)

BJ nineteen, second base, the beard

[Blackjack table number 19, second

position, man with the beard]

ACE

(Picks up the phone

again.)

Operator... I need Mr Happy, loud.

WAITRESSES

(In unison)

Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday

to you. Happy Birthday, dear Jeff.

Happy Birthday to you.

SECURITY GUARD #1

Man down!

SECURITY GUARD #1

Notify medical! We got a cardiac

arrest here!

SECURITY GUARD #2

He's fine, folks. Just give us some

room, please!

ACE (V.O.)

Watch it now.

SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.)

Stand back!

ACE (V.O.)

They never know what hit them. And

if and when...

ACE (V.O.)

...they do find out they just got

zapped by a cattle prod...

ACE (V.O.)

...they wish they really did have a

heart attack.

ACE (V.O.)

Turns out this guy and his fuckin'

pals, they were knockin' this place

dead for years.

SECURITY GUARD #1

He's got a wire on him.

SIGNALER

Hey, hey, what are you doin', man?

SECURITY GUARD #2

(Exposing the device)

There it is! On the table!

SECURITY GUARD #1

Cheater's justice!

SIGNALER

(In pain)

Oh, God! Oh!

SIGNALER

Hey, no! No! No!

ACE (V.O.)

We had to make an example of these

pricks that the party was over.

ACE

(To relieved SIGNALER)

I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling

your checks with your right hand.

Can you do that with both hands?

SIGNALER

No.

ACE

Can't do it with both hands?

SIGNALER

No, Sir.

ACE

Can you do it with your left hand?

SIGNALER

Well, I... I never tried.

ACE

So, you're a righty?

SIGNALER

Ye-yeah.

ACE

Now, you're gonna have to learn with

your left hand.

SIGNALER

God!

(He moans and sits

back.)

WINNER (O.S.)

(From following scene)

It's a hundred...

WINNER

...a hundred ten.

CASHIER

Yes, it is.

WINNER

I think.

CASHIER

Yes.

WINNER

Okay.

SHERBERT

Hiya. That's a lot of money to be

counting out in public.

WINNER

Yeah.

SHERBERT

(To CASHIER)

Why don't I take him over to the

office and verify it, huh?

CASHIER

Yes.

SHERBERT

A little privacy. And, by the way,

send over a... nice bottle of

champagne on ice, huh?

CASHIER

Sure will.

SHERBERT

Real special.  Somethin'...

(To WINNER.)

By the way...  I'm Billy Sherbert,

your casino manager.

WINNER

Hi.

SHERBERT

Having a good time?

WINNER

Yes, uh...

SHERBERT

You'll want to count the money in

privacy. You know, you don't need...

WINNER

Uh, I have a plane to catch to

Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?

SIGNALER

Look what they did to my hand, man!

ACE

(Walks over to the

WINNER)

All right, I'm gonna give you a

choice. You can either have the money

and the hammer or you can walk out

of here. You can't have both. What

do you want?

WINNER

I just wanna get out of here.

ACE

And don't forget to tell your friends

what happens if they fuck around in

here. You understand?

WINNER

I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.

ACE

You're fuckin' right, you made a bad

mistake. 'Cause if you come back

here - we catch either one of you -

we're gonna break your fuckin' heads

and you won't walk out of here. You

see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna

use it. You don't fuck around in

this place. You got it?

WINNER

Yeah.

ACE

Get out of here.

WINNER

Thank you.

ACE

(To the GUARDS,

referring to the

SIGNALER)

Throw him out in the alley.  And

just tell the cops he got hit by a

car.

ACE (V.O.)

Within no time, everything was set

in place. We got rid of the freelance

scamsters. The per was way up.  The

gods were happy, or as happy as the

gods can ever be.  And I, I decided

to complicate my life. For a guy who

likes sure things, I was about to

bet the rest of my life on a real

longshot.

ACE

We're not getting any younger. Don't

you think it's time? Aren't you

gettin' tired of all this shit?

Bangin' around, hustlin' around?

GINGER

What, are you trying to handicap me?

ACE

I'm gonna do you one better. I'm

trying to marry you. You want to

marry me?

(GINGER looks doubtful.)

I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to

settle down. I want a family.

GINGER

(Sighs, laughing)

You got the wrong girl, Sam.

ACE

I know I'd be a good father. I know

you'd be a good mother.

GINGER

You don't know me. What, you've known

me, two, three months. What do you

know?

ACE

I'm forty-three years old. I don't

want to wait. I know you well enough

to know that I really love you very

much.  And I can't think of anybody

better to be with. And I don't feel

like waiting anymore.

GINGER

You know a lot of happily married

people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.

ACE

Yeah, I know all that.

GINGER

I care about you, a - But I just

don't have those kind of feelings

for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love

with you.

ACE

(Brushing cigarette

ash off his dressing

gown)

I - I - I...

GINGER

Understand?

(Pause)

I'm sorry.

ACE

No, I - I... mean...  that can grow

as I - as long as there's a mutual

respect... that kind of thing can

grow. I'm realistic. I can accept

that. But, you know, what is...

What is love anyway?  It's a... it's

a mutual respect. It's - it's a

devotion. It's a... it's a caring

from one person to another. And if

we could set up some kind of

foundation...  based on that mutual

respect...  I feel that eventually

you would care enough about me...

that I could live with that.

GINGER

If it doesn't work out. You know, if

it doesn't play out, then what happens

to me?

ACE

You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm

gonna do even better. And so, whatever

happens, if it doesn't work out

between us, I'm gonna make sure you're

okay for the rest of your life. And

if there are kids, especially, you

know, I'll take care of you better

than you'd ever imagine.

GINGER

(Interrupts)

What're you... what're you pitching

me, here?

ACE

Just what I said. You'll be set up

for the rest of your life. That I

can promise you.

(Pause)

Want to take a chance?

ACE (V.O.)

When I married Ginger I knew all the

stories, but I didn't give a fuck.

'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can

change her.'

NICKY (V.O.)

It was typical Ace. He invited the

biggest people in town and he knew

they'd show. Because he knew they

all wanted somethin' from him.  With

Ace, nobody ever got a free ride.

Even Ginger. With her -

NICKY (V.O.)

- he still covered his bets. They

had to have the baby first, before

they got married. Even made Jennie

and me watch Amy for a few days when

they went on their honeymoon. But I

didn't mind, we loved the kid.

LESTER

(Over telephone)

Can you feel my eyes on you? Can you

feel me look into your heart?  Can

you feel me in the pit of your

stomach? Can you feel me in you? In

your heart?

LESTER

Don't make me come there. Answer me.

GINGER

(Over telephone,

sobbing)

I love you.

LESTER

(Into telephone)

Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I

love you too?

GINGER

(Over telephone)

No, Lester.

LESTER

(Into telephone)

Do you know that?

GINGER

(Over telephone)

Yeah. This is the best thing I can

do for my life right now.

LESTER

(Into telephone)

That's right.

LESTER

(Over telephone)

So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?

GINGER

(Sobbing, into

telephone)

Promise?

LESTER

(Over telephone)

God... I wish you...

LESTER

(Into telephone)

...all the luck in the world.

GINGER

(Over telephone)

You do?

LESTER

(Into telephone)

Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the -

it's the best thing you can do right

now. I mean this. And you'll have

real security.  Sweetheart... you're

gonna be situated just right in Vegas.

LESTER

(Over telephone)

Come on, this is great for us. You

know I'm gonna be here for you. I

ain't going no place. Huh?  I'm

lookin' at you right now. I'm seein'

you for the very first time, right

this minute. I'm seein' you, and I

can feel my heart click. I see you

fourteen years old. I see you the

first second I ever saw you. I see

you, long-legged little colt -

LESTER

- with stupid braces on your teeth.

GINGER

(Into telephone,

sniffing, trying to

cut him off)

Okay, then.

LESTER

(Over telephone)

Every time I ever see you, that's

what I see.

GINGER

(Into telephone)

Uh, talk to you later.  Bye.

(She hangs up the

phone quickly.)

ACE

You all right?

GINGER

(Drinking some

champagne, wiping

away tears)

Yeah.

ACE

Why're you crying?

GINGER

(Laughs)

I'm not crying.

(Sniffs.)

ACE

Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

GINGER

I'm okay. I just -

(Sniffs)

You just have to understand. I've

been with Lester since I was a kid.

I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I

just...  I don't... I think I have a

right to do that. Okay?

ACE

It's all right. That part of your

life is over with. Right?

GINGER

Yeah.

ACE

You're with me now.

GINGER

Yeah.

ACE

Right?

GINGER

Uh-huh.

ACE

You sure?

GINGER

Yeah. Yeah.

ACE

Want to go? Let's go back in.

GINGER

(Sniffs)

Okay.

GINGER

Oh...

GINGER

(Sighing)

It's great.

GINGER

Oh, it's great.

GINGER

(Running into the

closet)

Oh! It's all my stuff. Oh, my God.

GINGER

You brought all my stuff. I can -

ACE

Try it on. It's yours.

GINGER

(Whispering)

You're kidding? My God. What is it?

ACE

It's chinchilla.

GINGER

(Looking at herself

in the mirror)

Oh, it's so soft.

ACE

It's nice isn't it?

GINGER

Oh...

GINGER

No one's ever been so nice to me.

GINGER

(Gasps)

Oh, my God.

GINGER

So, do you think it's too much if I

wear these in the same day?

ACE

You do whatever you want. Do I keep

my promises, or do I keep my promises?

GINGER

You're so wonderful. The jewelry's

not so bad, either.

ACE

The only thing is... you shouldn't

keep this in the house. We gotta put

it in a bank.

GINGER

(Putting on a gold

bracelet)

Come on. Can I keep this one in the

house?

ACE

Now look,

(gently holding her

face, gathering her

total attention)

pay attention to me. What I'm gonna

tell you is very important.

GINGER

Okay.

ACE

All this stuff doesn't mean anything.

Money, this, doesn't mean anything

without trust. I have to be able to

trust you with my life.

ACE (V.O.)

With over a million in cash and jewels

tucked in a bank in Vegas only for

Ginger, she was secure and happy.

ACE (V.O.)

She loved that shit. But a guy in my

line of work has to have a lot of

pay-off cash around.

ACE (V.O.)

Crooked cops and kidnappers, they

don't take checks.

GINGER

Need a little help with that, Mr

Collins?

ACE (V.O.)

So, I put two million in cash in a

Los Angeles bank under the name of

Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was

strictly my shakedown and kidnapping

money.

ACE (V.O.)

And, since I'd either be in jail or

locked in a closet when I needed the

money the most...

ACE (V.O.)

...I gave Ginger the only key to the

cash that could get me back alive.

BANKER

Now this is just a signature card.

ACE

So, once she signs those papers,

she'll be the only person to have

total access to the box?  No one

else, including myself?

BANKER

That's right.

BANKER

That's the way you wanted it, right?

BANKER

(Quietly.)

Sam, let me ask you a question. You

must really trust your wife.

ACE

(Quietly)

Yeah, sure I do. Why?

BANKER

No, tha-that's good. It's just

unusual. To tell you the truth, so

many of my clients don't.

ACE

Well...

ACE (V.O.)

With Ginger and the money in place,

I felt covered, and to play it safe

I switched job titles again and made

myself, um, Food and Beverage

Director. This way nobody would bother

me about a license. I mean, Vegas

was like a dream for me. Trouble

was...

ACE (V.O.)

...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind

of Vegas.

NICKY (V.O.)

To begin, I put money out on the

streets, chargin' three points a

week. You know - juice to the fuckin'

dealers.

MARINO

(To MIKE)

Don't make us come lookin' for you.

MIKE

Oh, you won't have to look for me. I

appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.

NICKY

All right, Mike.

NICKY (V.O.)

They were degenerate gamblers, coke

freaks. In no time, I had half the

dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.

Then...

NICKY (V.O.)

...the next thing I did, I started

bustin' out high-stakes poker players.

ACE (V.O.)

It was so obvious. I mean, all of

Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they

were real signal happy.

MOOSH

(Scratching his arm)

I'm gonna open for five hundred.

ROCKY

Moosh, you open?

(Taps his fingers on

some chips before

picking them up.)

ACE (V.O.)

Signaling back and forth.

CARD SHARK

I bet thirty-five hundred.

DOCTOR DAN

I've been losing for three days

straight, non-stop.

ROCKY

Oh, why're you crying, with three

loaves of bread under your arm?

ACE (V.O.)

Nicky thought nobody was watching

him. But he was wrong.

ACE (V.O.)

And I didn't want any of those agents

near my place.

NICKY

Four aces, Doc.

NICKY

What do you got?

DOCTOR DAN

(Getting up in disgust)

Jesus Christ. I can't believe it.

DOCTOR DAN

If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't

have any luck. I'm out of here, you

understand?

ACE (V.O.)

I mean, I wished to God Nicky and

his whole crew would just get lost.

ACE (V.O.)

What am I gonna do? Go back home and

start a war?

ACE (V.O.)

I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm

not. I can't do that.

ACE

(Whispering in NICKY's

ear)

Be careful. Gaming agents are all

over the place.

NICKY

So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to

get lucky in this place?

ACE

You been lucky all week. They're

lookin' to nail ya.

NICKY (V.O.)

Ace was so fuckin' worried about his

casino, he forgot what we were doin'

out here in the first place.

NICKY (V.O.)

A million times I wanted to yell in

his fuckin' ear: 'This is Las Vegas!

We're supposed to be out here robbin',

you dumb fuckin' Heeb.'

ACE

(To SHERBERT, referring

to COWBOY)

I don't give a shit who he's connected

to. Tell him to take his fuckin'

feet off the table. What's he think

this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?

SHERBERT

Sir, would you mind taking your feet

off the table and putting your shoes

on, please?

COWBOY

(Sighs)

Yeah, I would mind. I'm havin' a bad

night.

SHERBERT

(Returning to ACE)

Fuckin' asshole won't budge.

ACE

Call security.

ACE

How are you?

COWBOY

Good. How are you?

ACE

Good. You want to do me a favor? You

want to take your feet off the table

and put your shoes back on?

COWBOY

Fuck you.

ACE

(To GUARDS)

I want you to exit this guy off the

premises, and I want you to exit him

off his feet and use his head to

open the fuckin' door.

SECURITY GUARD #1

Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You

mind accompanying us outside?

COWBOY

Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere

with you!

SECURITY GUARD #1

Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!

COWBOY

Fuck you! Fuck you!

SECURITY GUARD #1

Yeah?

COWBOY

You know who you're fuckin' with?!

Huh? Do you?!

SECURITY GUARD #1

Now move along.

COWBOY

(Screaming at ACE who

follows him)

You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who

you're fuckin' with?

COWBOY

Leave me alone!

SECURITY GUARD #1

Here we go!

COWBOY

(Grunting)

You've gotta be kidding me!

(Groans.)

ACE (V.O.)

(As COWBOY is thrown

out the door)

Sure enough, an hour later, I get

the call.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

Ace, what happened over there? I

mean, did you know that guy you threw

out was with me?

ACE

(Into telephone)

No, I didn't know that. But you know

what he did?

NICKY

(Over telephone)

No.

ACE

(Over telephone)

He insulted Billy. And then I walked

over to him politely...

ACE

(Into telephone)

...and he tells me to go fuck myself.

NICKY

(Over telephone)

What?

ACE

(Into telephone)

Then he called me a faggot.

ACE

(Over telephone)

So what do you think I do? I threw

that cocksucker out.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

What? Ho-

(He puts down the

phone; to COWBOY:)

Hey, come here.

NICKY

You called my friend a faggot? You

tell him to go fuck himself?

COWBOY

Nicky, I did -

NICKY

Is that what you did?

COWBOY

I did - I didn't -

NICKY

Tell him to go fuck himself? You

fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...

NICKY

(Over telephone)

...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come

here. Come here. Get him up. Come

here.

MARINO

(Over telephone)

Get up.

NICKY

(To COWBOY)

Come here, come here.

MARINO

Get up.

NICKY

You go over there right now and you

apologize. You better hope he lets

you back in.

NICKY

(Over telephone)

If you ever get out of line over

there again, I'll smash your fuckin'

head so hard...

NICKY

(To COWBOY)

...you won't be able to get that

cowboy hat on. You hear me? Fuckin'

hick.

(Into telephone)

Sammy, listen...

NICKY

(Over telephone)

...this guy obviously doesn't know

who he was talkin' to, you understand?

He doesn't...

NICKY

(Into telephone)

...know that, uh, we're dear friends.

I mean, he's already very sorry.

But, uh, if you could do me a favor

to let him back in, I swear to you

he'll never get out of line again. I

promise you that.

ACE

(Into telephone)

If he does it again, he's out for

good. I don't care what it is, Nick,

I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let

him in the place again.

NICKY

(Over telephone)

I'm sorry about this. Really.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

All right, Ace?

ACE

(Over telephone)

Okay.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

Thanks, pal.

NICKY

You took your boots off? You put

your feet on the table... you shit-

kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin'

motherfucker you!  You fuck me up

over there, I'll stick you in a hole

in the fuckin' desert! You understand?

(Slapping him.)

Go over there and apologize.

(Kicking the chastened

COWBOY away.)

Go! Get the fuck out of -

COWBOY

Nicky, I'm sorry.

NICKY (V.O.)

You know, Ace could be a very touchy

guy, especially when he got bigger

and bigger in town. Like when he

hired that Jonathon and David and

their tigers away from the Palace by

buildin' them a new stage and then

givin' them a silver Rolls Royce.

NICKY (V.O.)

But I'll tell you, he knew how to

bring in the crowds. He knew all the

fuckin' angles. He brought over the

whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris.

But he forgot how lazy them European

dancin' broads can get. I mean, he

had to weigh 'em in once a week to

make sure they didn't blow up like

fuckin' balloons.

ACE

(To SHOWGIRL)

You're still eight pounds over.

(To MANAGER.)

What's the reason for this?

STAGE MANAGER

Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on

suspension.

ACE

Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the

'sir'.

STAGE MANAGER

Well, sir, I was just...

ACE

Why is she eight pounds over?

STAGE MANAGER

...trying to offer you the respect

that your...

ACE

I...

STAGE MANAGER

...position...

ACE

'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.

STAGE MANAGER

Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes,

when you reach that pressure point,

when you put that pressure point on

them, you know, it shows...

ACE

She could at least lose half a pound

or a quarter.  Listen...

STAGE MANAGER

...and she doesn't always -

ACE

...all you do is give me answers.

Just - just give me the right answer.

STAGE MANAGER

But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I

guess, maybe, because she's frightened

that if she doesn't lose the weight

she may even get fired.

ACE

That's right. She will get fired. In

fact, I want you to send her back to

Paris.

STAGE MANAGER

It's always been our policy -

ACE

No. Just stop everything.

SHERBERT

(To ACE)

This woman's an institution.

ACE

I don't care what she is. She's an

institution, that's the problem.

She's lazy.

NICKY (V.O.)

Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He

does the most obvious thing. This is

the only town in the country where a

bookie joint is legit, so, why not

take advantage, right?  So... he

took bookie joints off the street

and then opened them up inside the

casino. Well, within a few years, by

doin' all of this, he had every casino

on the Strip trying to copy off him.

ACE (V.O.)

Between...

ACE (V.O.)

...my innovations...

ACE (V.O.)

...and Nicky's dedication to his

job...

ACE (V.O.)

...I soon had the best operation on

the Strip.

ACE

You better watch yourself. There's a

lot of heat on you already.

NICKY

Why, somebody's complaining?

ACE

I'm - I'm hearin' things from

security. They're all ex-cops. The

Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls.

They want to put you in the Black

Book.

NICKY

That Black Book is a bunch of

bullshit. They got two names in there

for the whole country and one of

them is still Al Capone.

ACE

Bullshit or no bullshit, they put

you in that book, you're gonna be in

a lot of trouble. You will not be

able to walk into the casino. I'm

tellin' you.

NICKY

What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin'

to make a livin', that's all.

ACE

I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I

didn't warn you.

NICKY

All right.

PHOTOGRAPHER #1

Mrs Rothstein, look straight ahead.

Very nice. Thank you.

PHOTOGRAPHER #2

Thank you.

PHOTOGRAPHER #1

Yes, nice smile.

PHOTOGRAPHER #3

Just look right at the camera. Hold

that pose.

GREEN (O.S.)

Considering all of his hard work and

dedication and the new lifeblood he

has instilled in Las Vegas...

GREEN

Sam has established himself as an

indispensable member of the gaming

community. As the head of the Tangiers

Gaming Corporation, it's my pleasure

to welcome Sam Rothstein to the Vegas

Valley Country Club.

ACE (V.O.)

Back home, they would have put me in

jail for what I'm doing. But out

here, they're givin' me awards.

ACE

(Into the microphone)

It's with great pleasure that I accept

this certificate of appreciation

from the...

COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #1

Congratulations, sweetheart.

GINGER

Thank you.

COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #2

Sam raised more than we've ever raised

before.

GINGER

He worked so hard.

ACE (V.O.)

But my greatest pleasure was watchin'

my wife, Ginger, work the room.

COUNTRY-CLUB MAN #1

Thank you for everything.

ACE (V.O.)

They all loved her. How could you

not live her?

GINGER

(To COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN

#3)

Hi. Nice to see you.

ACE (V.O.)

She could be the most charming woman

you ever saw. People loved to be

around her.

COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3

Listen, you've got to bring Amy to

Sasha's birthday party because he'd

love to have her there.

GINGER

Thanks.

COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3

We'll see you three o'clock Saturday.

GINGER

Thanks. Yes, all right.

COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3

Great.

ACE (V.O.)

She made everybody feel good.

EXECUTIVE

Congratulations, Sam.

ACE

(Shaking his hand)

Oh, thanks.

EXECUTIVE

Hello, Mrs Rothstein.

GINGER

Hi.

EXECUTIVE

How are you?

GINGER

Oh.

EXECUTIVE

You're one of the most gorgeous women

I've ever seen. You're a lucky man

Mr Rothstein.

ACE

Thank you. Thanks for that compliment.

ACE (V.O.)

He was a young kid from the casino...

nice kid...  bright boy. What balls

on this fuckin' kid! The next day I

fired him.

GINGER

(To AMY)

Hey, do you want to see this one?

Daddy gave me all this jewelry because

he loves me so much. (She places a

gold bracelet on AMY's hand.) Put

your arm in there.

ACE (V.O.)

But as much as they loved her...

GINGER

(To AMY, wearing the

bracelet)

Oh, fabulous.

ACE (V.O.)

...they didn't know what really moved

her.

GINGER

Look at this. Look at this.

GINGER (O.S.)

(From the viewing

room)

Daddy gave me this pin when we were

dating.

ACE (V.O.)

And with Ginger happy, I was able to

concentrate on what I knew best.

WARD

Loose machines are right back over

there.

ACE

What are they doin' way back there?

Bring 'em up here where they belong.

You can't even see 'em over there.

WARD

Okay, I'll -

ACE

What about the progressives with the

high jackpots? Where are they? These

machines are hidden.

WARD

Well...

ACE

These are our best machines. They

bring all the action. No wonder the

drop is off.

WARD

Yeah, okay.

ACE

The action is in the front, not in

the back. Bring 'em up front.

WARD

All right, I will, I will.

ACE

Listen to me very carefully. There

are three ways of doing things around

here. The right way, the wrong way,

and the way I do it. You understand?

WARD

I do understand that. I'll get right

on it. And thank you.

ACE

Don't thank me, just do it. You're

the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have

to tell you this.

WARD

Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I

am so sorry.

ACE (V.O.)

So, I ended up workin' what? Eighteen-

hour days?  Ginger was the one who

wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.

MAITRE D'

(To JENNIFER)

Come with me, please. I have a better

table for you.  Sorry.

JENNIFER

(Sitting down next to

GINGER)

So, what'd you say to that fuckin'

jerk anyway?

GINGER

(Smiling)

I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.

JENNIFER

(Chuckles)

Well, you might as well get somethin'

out of it.

ACE (V.O.)

Well, it wasn't long before what I

was afraid was gonna happen, happened.

Nicky managed to get himself banned

from every casino in Las Vegas, and

from then on, I couldn't be seen

talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or

even near it.

NICKY

(From inside the diner)

What the fuck is that supposed to

mean?

NICKY

(Reading from a

document)

' ...detrimental to gaming. And he

will be ejected from any casino in

Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be

fined as much as a hundred thousand

every time he shows up.'

(He waves the document.)

Do you believe this shit?

ACE

(Smoking a cigarette)

Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

NICKY

(Reading)

'Who is of notorious and unsavory

reputation...'

NICKY

Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'...

Is there any way around this?

ACE

Nope, there's no way.

NICKY

Let's say... for instance... I want

to go in the restaurant which happens

to be in the casino... to get one of

those sandwiches I like?

ACE

Forget it. You can't even set foot

in the parking lot. That's how serious

it is.

NICKY

In other words, I'm fucked.

ACE

In so many words, yes.

ACE (V.O.)

It just didn't sink into his head

about the Black Book and what it

meant. Not being able to go into a

casino is just one thing, but being

in this book etched your name into

the brains of every cop and FBI agent

in the state. I mean, you're listed

in there with Al Capone. But Nicky

didn't care.

NICKY

I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do

somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of

me. They're not gettin' rid of me.

I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck

'em.

NICKY (V.O.)

So, once they pulled that shit, I

started doin' my own things in Vegas

nobody ever thought of doin'. To

keep an eye on things, I brought in

my kid brother Dominick... and some

desperadoes from back home and started

knockin' over high rollers, casino

bosses, bookmakers, anybody, right

here in town. I had a good fuckin'

crew goin' for me, I'll tell you

that.

NICKY (V.O.)

I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story

guy. Jack Hardy, he worked for a

safe company after he did a six-year

bit. And then there was Bernie Blue.

This guy could bypass any alarm for

me. And I opened up my own jewelry

store, too: 'The Gold Rush'.

NICKY (V.O.)

Sometimes I used to go along on a

heist just for the fun of it. But I

didn't like the people I was rippin'

off lookin' at me, so I used to turn

their fuckin' pictures around.

NICKY

(To MARINO and HARDY)

What's takin' so long over there?

MARINO

This peter's a motherfucker.

HARDY

(Grunting)

It's workin'. Just keep workin' it.

It's comin'.

NICKY

Gotta learn how to open these fuckin'

things so you won't have to take

'em.

NICKY

Frankie, some of these stones got a

lot of niggers in 'em.

NICKY

Tell that fuckin' Pepe if he's

switching stones on us, he'd better

take a fuckin' camel -

NICKY

- back to

(picking up phone)

Nigeria.

(Into telephone)

Yeah.

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST

(Over telephone)

Listen...

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST

(Talking quietly into

telephone)

...they're in Penthouse K.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

They check in alone?

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST

(Into telephone)

They checked in alone.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

Are they out now?

HOTEL RECEPTIONIST

(Into telephone)

Yes, don't worry.

NICKY

(Over telephone)

All right.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

Thanks.

ACE (V.O.)

He had tipsters...

ACE (V.O.)

...all over town. Bellmen.

BELLMAN

(Into telephone) This one looks good.

But you got to hurry.

MARINO

(Over telephone)

Yeah...

MARINO

(Into telephone)

...yeah, okay.

ACE (V.O.)

Valet parkers.

VALET PARKER

(Into telephone)

They're just checking in now.

FUSCO

(Into telephone, seated

on a couch)

Okay, I'll tell him.

ACE (V.O.)

Pit bosses.

PIT BOSS

(Into telephone)

Yeah, room twelve-thirty, at the

Sirocco.

MARINO

(Into telephone)

Twelve-thirty, right.

ACE (V.O.)

Secretaries.

SECRETARY

(Into telephone)

It's all in mint condition coins.

HARDY

(Into telephone)

Mint condition. All right.

ACE (V.O.)

And they all...

ACE (V.O.)

...got a piece of the score.

HARDY

(From inside the van,

into a walkie-talkie)

Car's comin'.

ACE (V.O.)

They were always very careful. And

they always bypassed the alarms, or

else... if not, they'd drill enough

holes to knock through the walls

with a sledgehammer...

ACE (V.O.)

Nobody out there was expecting a guy

like him.

ACE (V.O.)

For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fuckin'

Wild West.

STORE OWNER

(Leading a detective

to his showroom)

I just got a shipment of diamonds

from Israel...

NICKY (V.O.)

But what the fuck they expect from

me? I had to earn, didn't I?

IRANIAN #1

You know, this diamond has flaws in

it.

MARINO

No, no, there's no flaws in it.

IRANIAN #2

Don't tell me. I'm doing this for

twenty-five years.

MARINO

You better clean your fuckin' loupe.

'Cause there's no flaws in these

diamonds.

NICKY (V.O.)

Whenever we got local merch, we'd

usually send it to Palm Spring or

Arizona... LA. I had a couple of

sand niggers out there. You know,

Arabs.

MARINO

What, are you gonna have a fuckin'

meeting here, or are you gonna buy

some diamonds?

IRANIAN #2

(Chuckling)

No, no. I know his language. I'm

talking with him.

MARINO

Forty thousand dollars, you can buy

the whole package.

IRANIAN #1

Twenty thousand, and that's my final

offer and...

MARINO

(To IRANIAN #2)

All of a sudden he talks English,

now.

(To IRANIAN #1.)

Let's talk turkey here, how 'bout

twenty-five thousand?

NICKY (V.O.)

I actually turned my bedroom into a

bank vault where I kept the choice

stuff.

MARINO

(Referring to JENNIFER

as they pass the

kitchen)

She asleep?

NICKY

Every night, on the couch.

NICKY (V.O.)

I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush

in case we got raided by the cops...

or if my crew got cute.

NICKY (V.O.)

I had the only key.

NICKY (V.O.)

Jennifer didn't give a fuck. She

used to fall asleep on the couch

watchin' television every night.

This stuff was all mine. I didn't

send any of this back home.

NICKY (V.O.)

Actually, I couldn't because I wasn't

even supposed to be doin' it. The

bosses were makin' so much fuckin'

money with the casinos

(unlocking the safe)

that they didn't want anybody makin'

any waves for them.

NICKY

Give all the guys in your crew a

piece of that?

MARINO

I took care of everybody.

NICKY

Yeah?

NICKY (V.O.)

That's why there was no real organized

street stuff in Vegas before I came

here.

CHARLIE CLARK

Yeah, that works out.

NICKY (V.O.)

But how much cash could I bury in my

closet, right?

CHARLIE CLARK

You need to understand, and I - I'm

sure you do... that in a venture of

this kind, you have to be prepared

to take some kind of loss.

NICKY

Oh, listen, I understand that there's

always a risk... you know, I might

have to take a loss somewhere.

NICKY (V.O.)

So I put some of the money into

legitimate deals with Charlie Clark.

He was Ace's banker.

NICKY

I mean, you will try to push it

through, won't you, Mr Clark?

CHARLIE CLARK

Yes.

NICKY

Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving

you fifty thousand cash.

NICKY (V.O.)

Then I put some more of the money...

NICKY (V.O.)

...in some legitimate places, like

my restaurant.

DOMINICK

(To COOK preparing

sandwich)

Is that the last one?

COOK

Yeah.

NICKY (V.O.)

I had my kid brother, Dominick, run

it for me.

DOMINICK

(Spits)

Fuckers!

DOMINICK

Here you go, guys.

COP #1

All right. Thanks, a lot.

DOMINICK

Yeah... yeah, enjoy.

COP #2

Yeah.

DOMINICK

Have a good time.

(Muttering to himself.)

Choke on it, ya motherfucker!

MAN #1

(Passing DOMINICK on

his way out)

Hey, Dom.

DOMINICK

Hey, how you doin'?

ACE (V.O.)

Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He

was a real restaurant buff. And over

the years, he always made money with

them.

NICKY

(Looking at one of

the patrons)

Hey, Rich.

ACE (V.O.)

In Vegas, he had The Leaning Tower.

It was a very popular spot. He had

politicians, showgirls and movies

stars hangin' out all over the place.

NICKY

Listen, that show over at the Flamingo

gets better and better.

STEVE ALLEN

By the way, Sammy said whenever you

have a minute, give him a call.

NICKY

Made a messenger out of you too,

huh?

STEVE ALLEN

(Laughs)

I'll do anything for a buck.

NICKY

He does it. He does it to everybody.

Enjoy your dinner.

JAYNE MEADOWS

(Chuckles)

Thanks.

STEVE ALLEN

Okay, thanks.

ACE (V.O.)

But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky

liked the most was the showgirls,

naturally. I mean, to them, Nicky

was the movie star.

NICKY

(To MARINO)

You walk past me?

MARINO

Hey. This is Shelly.

NICKY

Hey, Shelly.

(Kisses her hand.)

SHELLY

Hi.

NICKY

How are you? Nice to meet you.

MARINO

(Pointing to STACY)

And this is Stacy.

NICKY

Stacy.

(Kisses her hand.)

MARINO

(To the SHOWGIRLS)

This is Nick.

NICKY

Pleasure.

STACY

Hi, Nick.

MARINO

We're gonna have dinner. Come on.

NICKY

All right, uh,

(To SHELLY)

Let's just check the kitchen first.

Excuse us one second. Come on, I'll

show you.

NICKY (V.O.)

(From following scene)

'Cause I fly stuff in fresh every

day.

NICKY

I get bread from back home. I get

fish from California. And you can

always tell a great kitchen like

ours because of the milk-fed veal.

That's the secret.

NICKY

See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

Out here, they got that pink veal.

Slide over, honey.

NICKY

Now, pink veal, you can pound that

shit for two days and it'll never

get tender, you know what I mean?

AL

When I left here with the money...

NICKY

Mm.

AL

...I got muscled on the street.

NICKY

Mm.

AL

A couple of guys, I owe them. So,

that's what I did. I gave 'em the

money.  That's what I did.

NICKY

Yeah?

AL

Yeah.

NICKY

You call yourself a man? You know

you're a lyin', low-life,

motherfuckin' gambling degenerate

prick? You know that's what you are?

Two small kids at home. I gave you

money to pay the fuckin' rent and

buy groceries, put the heat on. You

know your wife called Frankie and

told him the fuckin' heat's off?

NICKY

Huh? And you didn't gamble that

fuckin' money? You're gonna stand

here and tell me that?

NICKY

No, no? You didn't?

AL

I didn't give 'em the m-

NICKY

Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a

fuck out of me! You want to embarrass

me and make a fool out of me?!  You

didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled

the fuckin' money, I'll give you the

fuckin' money to put the fuckin'

heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!

NICKY

Fuckin' degenerate, you.

NICKY

Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.

(Giving him the money.)

Get the fuck out of here.

AL

Thanks, Nick.

NICKY

Yeah, thanks.

NICKY

Let me find out you fucked up, I'll

leave you wherever I find you.

NICKY

(To LITTLE NICKY)

How many of these you gonna eat,

huh?

LITTLE NICKY

Two.

NICKY

Two?

ACE (V.O.)

But around six-thirty in the morning

when he finished his day -

ACE (V.O.)

- no matter where he was or what he

was doing, he always went home to

make breakfast for his son, Nicky-

Boy.

NICKY

(Pouring some syrup

on his son's pancakes)

Here, let's put a little of this on

for you. I know you like this. A

little butter, right, not a lot?

LITTLE NICKY

Mm-hm.

NICKY

You know why, right?

LITTLE NICKY

Yeah.

NICKY

Why?

LITTLE NICKY

'Cause it clogs up your heart.

NICKY

What a smart kid you are!

(Kisses him.)

Okay, eat.

NICKY (V.O.)

Every couple of weeks I used to send

Marino back to the bosses with a

piece of what I made.

NICKY (V.O.)

Not a big piece, but fuck them, what

did they know? They were fifteen

hundred miles away...

NICKY (V.O.)

...and I don't know anybody who can

see that far. Their drop was a truck

stop/garage where...

NICKY (V.O.)

...Remo and the guys used to hang

out and count their millions.

MARINO

Remo.

GAGGI

Hey, Frankie.

MARINO

How are you?

GAGGI

Fine, fine.

NICKY (V.O.)

I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't

give a fuck. I mean, you know, they

all worked it out together.

MARINO

Nicky sends his warmest regards.

GAGGI

Uh-huh. Good.

NICKY (V.O.)

But I knew how to keep the bosses

happy. Whenever they gave me little

jobs to do, you know, to send a

message, I would carry things out...

GAGGI

And how are things going down there?

MARINO

Fine. Everything's goin' good.

NICKY (V.O.)

...to a tee. Like the time Tony

Dogs...

NICKY (V.O.)

...who was supposed to be the new

maniac tough guy in town, shot up

one of Remo's bars. Here's a fuckin'

guy, kills two of Remo's guys and a

poor fuckin' waitress, who was just

workin' on her night off, of all

things.

NICKY (V.O.)

I mean, this guy's just beggin' to

be made an example of.

GAGGI (V.O.)

(From his office)

Frankie...

GAGGI

...I want all the names of all the

other people he had with him. And I

don't care what you have to do to

him to get 'em. You understand?

MARINO

I'll take care of it, Remo.

GAGGI

E mo va! [Italian-American slang for

'Now, go!']

NICKY (V.O.)

To be truthful with you, I had to

admire this fuckin' guy.  He was one

of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.

NICKY

This fuckin' guy, he got some stamina,

don't he?

NICKY (V.O.)

This son-of-a-bitch was tough.

NICKY

Personally, I don't give a fuck who

was with him anyway. As long as he

gives me a name I could give to them.

NICKY (V.O.)

For two days and two fuckin' nights,

we beat the shit out of this guy. I

mean, we even stuck ice-picks in his

balls.

NICKY

You better hope he gives me a fuckin'

name soon, or I'm gonna give him

yours, Frank.

MARINO

(To NICKY)

Yeah, thanks a lot.

NICKY (V.O.)

But he never talked.

NICKY

(To MARINO)

I know you would have ratted by now.

NICKY (V.O.)

In the end, I had to put his fuckin'

head in a vise.

NICKY

Dogs. Dogs, can your hear me, Dogs?

NICKY

Listen to me, Anthony. I got your

head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna

squash your fuckin' head like a

grapefruit if you don't give me a

name. Don't make me have to do this,

please. Come on. Don't make me be a

bad guy. Come on.

TONY DOGS

(With what strength

he as left)

Fuck you!

NICKY

(To MARINO and BLUE)

This motherfucker, do you believe

this? Two fuckin' days and nights!

(To DOGS.)

Fuck me?

NICKY

Fuck me, you motherfucker?

(Turning the vise.)

Fuck my mother? That's what you

fuckin' tell me?

NICKY

Huh? You motherfucker, you, huh?

NICKY

Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!

TONY DOGS

Ch-Charlie M!

NICKY

Charlie M?

TONY DOGS

(Blood streaming out

of his mouth)

Charlie M.

NICKY

(Screaming)

Charlie M? You make me pop your

fuckin' eye out of your head to

protect that piece of shit? Charlie

M? You dumb motherfucker!

TONY DOGS

(Pleading)

Kill me, you fuck, kill me.

NICKY

Kill you,

(unwinds the crank)

You motherfucker you!

(To MARINO.)

Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.

ACE (V.O.)

The word got around that finally...

ACE (V.O.)

...there was a real gangster in town.

Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

NICKY

Charlie M!

ACE

Four reels, sevens across, three

fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do

you have any idea what the odds are?

WARD

Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions,

maybe more.

ACE

Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty

minutes? Why didn't you pull the

machines? Why didn't you call me?

WARD

Well, it happened so quick. Three

guys won. I didn't have a chance to

call you.

ACE

You didn't see the scam? You didn't

see what was goin' on?

WARD

Well, there's no way to determine

that, Sam.

ACE

Yes, there is. An infallible way!

They won!

WARD

Well, it's a casino. People gotta

win sometimes.

ACE

Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off.

Now, you're insulting my intelligence.

What do you think, I'm a fuckin'

idiot? You know goddamn well somebody

had to get into those machines and

set those fuckin' reels.

ACE

The probability on one-four-reel

machine is a million and a half to

one. On three machines in a row,

it's in the billions.  It cannot

happen... would not happen, you

fuckin' momo! What's the matter with

you!  Didn't you see you were bein'

set up on the second win?

WARD

I really think you're -

ACE

(Interrupts)

You - Wait! You didn't see that you

were being set up on the second win?

WARD

I really think you're overreacting

in this whole -

ACE

(Interrupts)

Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had

it with you. I've been carryin' your

ass in this place ever since I got

here. Get your ass and get your things

and get out of here.

WARD

You're firin' me?

ACE

I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'

(mocking WARD)

I'm firin' you, you -

WARD

You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.

ACE

I'll regret it even more if I keep

you on.

WARD

This is not the way to treat people.

ACE

Listen, if you didn't know you're

bein' scammed, you're too fuckin'

dumb to keep this job. If you did

know, you were in on it. Either way,

you're out!  Get out! Go on.

(To SHERBERT.)

Let's go.

ACE

I mean, the guy is history as far as

I'm concerned. History.

GREEN

But you can't just fire him. Webb's

his brother-in-law. He's County

Commissioner.

ACE

So what? Everybody out here with

cowboy boots is a fuckin' county

commissioner or related to a county

commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of

it.

GREEN

This is his state. His uncle's Chief

Judge. His brother-in-law runs the

County Commission. I don't know how

many other relatives he's got in

town.  There's gotta be a way to

work him back in.

ACE

Phil, I can understand. You're in

the finances, you're upstairs, but

you are not on the floor. I got

thousands of players. I got five

hundred dealers.  They're all lookin'

to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a

day. I have to let them know I'm

watching all the details, all the

time; that there is not one single

thing I will not catch as I am over

here.

ACE

Look at yours.

GREEN

What?

ACE

Look at that. Look at this. There's

nothin'... look how many blueberries

your muffin has and how many mine

has. Yours is falling apart. I have

nothing.

GREEN

What are you talking about?

ACE

It's like everything else in this

place. You don't do it yourself, it

never gets done.

GREEN

Where you goin'?

ACE

(Handing the BAKER

the two muffins)

From now on I want you to put an

equal amount of blueberries in each

muffin. An equal amount of blueberries

in each muffin.

BAKER

You know how long that's going to

take?

ACE

I don't care how long it takes. Put

an equal amount in each muffin.

ACE

Come on, honey, just a little. That

a girl, that a girl. Oh, boy, look.

ACE

(To AMY, who is sobbing

and mumbling)

Okay, want to go with Mommy?

ACE

What do you need?

GINGER

(Giving AMY to the

NANNY)

You get her?  Okay.

(To ACE.)

Well, I need a lot. I need more than

usual.

ACE

Well, why don't you take it out of

your account? There's a lot there.

GINGER

Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's

just that... well, I need more than

that. I need twenty-five thousand.

ACE

Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?

GINGER

(Picking up an empty

carton of milk)

Yeah.

ACE

Why do you need that much?

GINGER

Well, what's the difference? I just

need it.

ACE

Well, I mean... you know, I gotta

ask you. That's a lot of money.

You're not asking for a box of

popcorn, you know. I mean...

GINGER

I'm aware of that. We don't have to

turn this into a big deal.

(Getting up to the

refrigerator.)

Okay? We don't have to have a fight.

It was important to me. But forget

it. Just something I wanted to do

for myself.

ACE

Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you

know, tell me what it's for.

ACE

Why can't you tell me what it's for?

ACE

Huh?

(Pause)

Well, you know what? Now, I want you

to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to

me and asks me for twenty-five

thousand. I mean, what do you want?

Do you want a coat?

GINGER

No.

ACE

Well, if you want a coat, you got

it. You know that. It's not the money,

it's just why do you want it?  That's

all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to

that?

GINGER

Look - Sam, I've been independent my

whole life. I never had to ask anybody

for anything. Now you're making me

beg you for this.

ACE

What are you talkin' a- ?

GINGER

(Interrupting)

Okay? And you're embarrassing me.

Why do want to make me feel so bad?

ACE

You're askin' me for twenty-five

thousand. I'm not out to make you

feel bad. I want to just be able to

trust you. You now, it's about trust.

I have to be able to trust you with

my life. Do you understand? Can I

trust you?

(She doesn't answer.)

Can I trust you?... Can I trust

you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?

GINGER

(Quietly)

You can trust me.

ACE

Good, so then you could tell me what

the money is for.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

Yeah, she's leavin' the bank now.

All right, I'm gonna follow her.

(He hangs up.)

LESTER

What does that mean? No, I know that

look. What does that mean?

GINGER

It means I got the money.

LESTER

You got money. That's a - That's a

good look.

ACE

How you doin', Les? It's Lester,

right? Sam.

ACE

From my recollection, aren't you the

card shark... the golf hustler...

the pimp from Beverly Hills?

ACE

If I'm wrong, please correct me,

'cause I never knew you to be a heist

man.

(LESTER sighs.)

But if you are, you know what...

here, take mine too.

ACE

Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already

have hers.

ACE

She's my wife.

(To LESTER.)

Look at me. You did know that, didn't

you? You knew that she's my wife?

Huh? Hey, look at me.

LESTER

Yeah, yeah. I know that.

ACE

You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come

back again... ever... to take her

money... next time bring a pistol.

That way you got a chance. Be a man,

don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you

want to do me a favor? Get out of

here. I want to be alone with my

wife. Get the fuck up and get out of

here.

LESTER

(Quietly)

Okay.

ACE

You fuckin' piece of shit.

LESTER

Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's

bullshit. You know, you know, what

the fuck?

ACE

You remember when you called him

that night? When you said goodbye to

him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get

married, I'll be right down, we'll

get married.'  He didn't say that to

you, did he?

GINGER

(Whispering)

No, he didn't.

ACE

(Picks up the money)

Didn't. No, instead, what did he

say? 'Fuck him. Take him for

everything he's got.'

ACE

Come here, I want to show you

somethin'.

HOOD #1

You fuckin' shit.

GINGER

No! No! No! Don't!

GINGER

Make them stop it!

(Sobbing.)

No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's

my fault!

GINGER

(Sobbing)

No! No!

LESTER

(Falling into the

front seat on his

back.)

Fuck!

LESTER

Fuck you!

HOOD #2

You piece of shit.

LESTER

(As ACE and GINGER

drive off down the

street)

Couldn't do it yourself, you

chickenshit cocksucker!

GINGER

(Throwing the iron on

the counter)

He's such a prick. He had some guy

from the hotel beat him up. He didn't

want to do it himself. Oh, no, he

didn't want to get his own hands

dirty.

GINGER

So, why'd he have to do that, huh?

GINGER

Tell me.

NICKY

I know it wasn't a nice thing to do

but -

GINGER

(Interrupts)

Yeah, no shit.

NICKY

Well, you gotta understand it. He

doesn't know if this guy is shaking

you down or taking advantage of you.

GINGER

No! No! I told him all about the guy

before we ever got married. This is

no fuckin' surprise.

NICKY

Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

GINGER

Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I

was trying to help, so... so what?

NICKY

You know... the first time I ever

saw your guys together... I never

saw him so happy. I mean, I know

he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything,

but...

NICKY

I never see - You know, I never seen

him act like that with anybody else.

I think he's crazy about you. I mean,

he really loves you. He does.

GINGER

Oh, come on. I went into this with

my eyes open, you know. I knew the

bottom could drop out at any time.

I'm a working girl, right?  You don't

think I'm gonna go into a situation

like this if I don't think I'm gonna

get covered on the back end.

NICKY

Sure.

GINGER

Am I right?

NICKY

I can see that. Sure.

GINGER

So, he put aside some jewelry for

me. A lot of jewelry.

NICKY

You mean, like a lot of expensive

jewelry? About how much?

GINGER

Mm, you want to steal it?

(Cracking a smile.)

NICKY

No. I - I'm just curious, you know.

I was wonderin' how much he would

put into a thing like that. That's

all.

GINGER

I'm told it's worth about a million

dollars, maybe more.

(Sniffs.)

NICKY

Well, there you go. But what does

that tell ya? A million dollars in

jewelry. Does that tell you the guy

is crazy about you, or what?

GINGER

I should have never married him.

He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini...

duality.

(Breaking down.)

Gemini's the snake. You know you

can't trust the snake.

(Sniffs.)

I mean it.

NICKY

I know what you mean.

NICKY

Listen, Ginger... you know, this is

probably not... I don't have the

answers anyway... and this is probably

not what you want to hear right now,

because you're a little upset with

Ace.

GINGER

I do.

NICKY

I understand that. But, you know, I

think you should try to make the

best of it now. Go slow, you know.

See what happens.

GINGER

He could have killed him! Okay? He

could have killed him.

GINGER

He didn't have to hit him. It's not

exactly like I'm sleepin' with the

guy! And he makes me sneak around to

see my own friends! What the fuck is

that all about?

NICKY

Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves

you so much. He's jealous and worried.

GINGER

(Sighs, her voice

starts to crack)

He gives a fuck what I do?

NICKY

(Getting up)

Look, I'll try to find out what the

hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll

talk to him.

GINGER

Okay.

NICKY

All right?

GINGER

Yeah.

(Walking over to him,

smiling.)

Thanks.

GINGER

Thanks for puttin' up with me.

NICKY

And take it easy with this shit,

will you? I mean, this can only make

matters worse.

GINGER

Oh, come on.

NICKY

You're a beautiful girl. You don't

want to ruin your looks. I've seen a

lot of girls get shot to hell from

this stuff.

GINGER

(Fidgeting with his

jacket, then holding

his face in her hands,

smiling.)

You're so nice.

(She begins to cry.)

NICKY

Come on, now, I don't want to see

you unhappy.

GINGER

(Tenderly strokes his

head)

Thanks.

NICKY

Yeah.

GINGER

(Through tears)

Thank you.

NICKY

(Feeling a little

awkward with the hug)

It's all right.

SECRETARY

(Into telephone)

Mr Rothstein? County Commissioner

Pat Webb is here to see you.

ACE

(Over telephone)

Okay...

ACE

(Into telephone)

...give me a minute.

SECRETARY

(Over telephone)

Okay.

SECRETARY

(To WEBB)

It'll just be a minute.

SECRETARY

Mr Webb...  Can I get you anything?

WEBB

Oh, no.

(Cordially tipping

his hat.)

No, thank you, little lady.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Okay, send him in and call me four

minutes after.

WEBB

Mr Rothstein...

(With hand outstretched

to ACE.)

I'm Pat Webb.

ACE

How do you do?

WEBB

Hey, it is my pleasure.

ACE

Yeah, I heard a lot about you.

WEBB

Oh, thank you, sir.

WEBB

Hey, house is doin' well.

(Chuckling.)

Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I

appreciate you takin' the time to

see a poor ol' civil servant.

ACE

No, that's quite all right.

ACE

Why don't you have a seat?

WEBB

Hm? Oh. Thank you, sir.

WEBB

Uh, I come here personally to kind

of smooth over a fracas about a

certain matter. See, uh, maybe you

didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is

a very well-liked man in this town.

He's got lots of friends here. Now,

his family and their money go back

many, many years. Now, friends vote...

family and money votes. That's

important to me... and you. And if

you'll think about our little problem

along them lines...  and you forgive

me for sayin' it, maybe he did not

deserve to be fired.

ACE

I'm sorry, but he knew about our

gettin' hit on three big machines in

a row and he did nothing about it.

That means either he was in on it

or, forgive me for saying this, he

was too dumb to see what was going

on. Either way, I cannot have a man

like that workin' here.

WEBB

Before we point the dirty end of the

stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be

sure we can prove them charges.

ACE

Believe me, if I could prove it, he

would be under arrest.

WEBB

Are, uh -

(Clears throat.)

- are we certain that you want the

Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your

record and your gangster pals like

Nicky Santoro?

ACE

I think you're way out of line talkin'

to me like that. What you're sayin'

is libelous, and you're in no position

to challenge my expertise. I went

way out of my way to be very helpful

and courteous to that kid. He's weak,

he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the

whole place. There's not much more I

can do for him.

WEBB

(Chuckling)

You have got me there. Old Don is as

useless as tits on a boar.

(Chuckles.)

But, he is my brother-in-law, and I

would look on it as a personal favor

if you'd think some more on hirin'

him back.

ACE

I can't do that. And I appreciate

the fact that he's your brother-in-

law, and I do want to help you and I

like to do favors, and I know who

you are, but I cannot do that.

WEBB

Well, could there be any position...

further down the trough?

ACE

(Pause)

I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's

too incompetent. And the bottom line

is, he cannot be trusted.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Okay, thanks.

(To WEBB.)

Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.

WEBB

Mr Rothstein. Your people never will

understand the way it works out here.

You're all just our guests. But you

act like you're at home. Let me tell

you somethin', partner... you ain't

home. But that's where we're gonna

send you if it harelips the Governor.

(Pause.)

Thank you for your time.

ACE

No problem.

(Getting up and shaking

hands.)

Sorry.

WEBB

(Smiles slightly)

You bet.

ACE

What happened to my pills?

GINGER

Huh?

ACE

(Waving the pill bottle)

Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin'

too much, you're takin' all my pills

too?

GINGER

I didn't take your pills.

ACE

Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a

one of these, a half a one of these.

And that's when I have extreme pain.

I had a three-month supply. What'd

you do with 'em?

GINGER

(Sobbing)

You didn't have to beat him up!

ACE

(Walking back to the

bathroom)

What?

GINGER

(Sobbing)

I was just tryin' to help him. It's

not like I'm sleeping with the guy!

ACE

Yeah, how do I know?

GINGER

(Sobbing)

You can't make me stop caring...

ACE

What? What?!

GINGER

I said, you can't make me stop caring

about people.

ACE

(Trying to calm her)

Listen.

(Stepping up to the

bed.)

Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best

of everything here, you know?  I

mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes.

Uh, I mean... people look up to you

in this town. I don't know what to

think -

GINGER

(Interrupts)

You know what, Ace? I don't give a

shit! I'm gettin' out of here.

(Crying.)

I am.

ACE

(Walking around the

bed to her)

It's okay.  Look...

(holding her face,

gently)

...you gotta get a hold of yourself.

GINGER

Okay.

ACE

If not for me, at least for Amy.

GINGER

(Sobbing)

Okay, okay.

ACE

(Gently)

You understand? Your drinking's

gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna

get you into a program. They got

plenty of good ones.

GINGER

I don't need one.

ACE

Yes, you do. It's very discreet.

There's no names in the papers. You

don't have to worry about any of

that stuff.

GINGER

That's all you care about.

(Collapsing on the

edge of the bed.)

You don't care about me at all.

ACE

(Bending down to her)

Yes, I - yes, I do.

GINGER

No, you don't.

ACE

How could you say that?  You're a

beautiful woman. You're destroying

yourself. You don't need that stuff.

You don't need that fuckin' leech

livin' off you. I know you better

than you know yourself. You're a

tiger, you're stronger than I am.

And when you set your mind on doing

something, you do it better than

anybody.

(Strokes her hair.

Then, quietly:)

You can do it.

(Kissing her.)

You can do it.

GINGER

(Sobbing)

Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay...

I'll try. I'll try.

GINGER

I'll try. I will. Don't be mad at

me, okay... I will.

NICKY (V.O.)

No matter what the problems were

outside the count room, it was all

worth it. The cash kept rollin' in.

And the...

NICKY (V.O.)

...suitcases kept comin' and goin'.

And let me tell ya, the fuckin' bottom

line here is... cash.

NICKY (V.O.)

The only problem was that, after a

while, the bosses noticed that the

suitcases were gettin' a little light.

BORELLI

Aspett'. [Italian-American slang for

'Wait'] Wait a minute. You mean to

tell me that the money we're robbing

is bein' robbed? That somebody's

robbing from us?  We go through all

this fuckin' trouble, and somebody's

robbin' us?

GAGGI

(To NANCE)

Eh?

NANCE

Like I said, you know, i-it's part

of the business. I-it's considered

leakage.

BORELLI

Leakage, my balls. I want the guy

who's robbin' us.

NICKY (V.O.)

Even John Nance, that's the guy who

ran the skim, he knew there wasn't

much you could do about it. You gotta

know that a guy who helps you steal,

even if you take care of him real

well, I mean, he's gonna steal a

little bit extra for himself. Makes

sense, don't it? Right? Well, you go

try and make these hard-headed old

greaseballs understand that.

BORELLI

What's the point of skimming if we're

being skimmed? Defeats the whole

purpose of what we're doin' out there.

GAGGI

(To NANCE)

Huh?

NANCE

You know, they take this money because

they're my guys. So you gotta give

'em some leeway.

NICKY (V.O.)

But the bosses never believed in

leeway, so listen to what they do:

they...

NICKY (V.O.)

...put Artie Piscano, the underboss

of KC, in charge of making sure nobody

skimmed the skim.

BORELLI

What the hell have you been doin'

out there?

PISCANO

I was out there with my cumma [Italian-

American slang for 'girlfriend'.]

BORELLI

Your cumma? What are you doin' with

your cumma?

PISCANO

What else? I gave her a schaff

[Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]

NICKY (V.O.)

The only trouble was, Piscano was a

disaster. This guy could fuck up a

cup of coffee.

BORELLI

Artie, what the hell have you been

doin' out there, Artie?

PISCANO

I'm out there more than I'm here.

NICKY (V.O.)

And little did anybody know where

this would all lead. If they did,

they would have been better off makin'

fuckin' novenas.

BORELLI

You gotta go back there and talk to

that guy.

PISCANO

Come on, go back there? I never got

paid my expenses for the last trip.

BORELLI

What expenses?

PISCANO

Well, I'm goin' all over, layin'

money out of my own pocket, and I

never get anything back. What the

hell's goin' on?

BORELLI

You gotta go back out there.

PISCANO

Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna

start keepin' records.

BORELLI

Artie, no records, Artie. What are

you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?

PISCANO

Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin'

dough for these trips and nothin'

ever comes back. I mean, what hell's

goin' on? What are we doin' over

here?

BORELLI

You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're

havin' a good time at my expense.

What the fuck? I mean, after all,

you're the one having a good time,

not me.

ACE (V.O.)

No matter how many novenas you could

make, nothin'...

ACE (V.O.)

...was gonna stop what came up next

at the casino.

GREEN

I can't believe you're doing this.

SCOTT

We made a deal. You came to me,

remember?

GREEN

Yes, I appreciated your advice...

ACE (V.O.)

It turned out Phil Green, Mr

Integrity, had a partner nobody knew

about... and when she showed up and

started demanding some money from

the Tangiers...

GREEN

Why are you doing this to me?

SCOTT

Because you're wrong.

GREEN

I'm not wrong.

SCOTT

Yes, you are.

GREEN

No, I am not wrong.

ACE (V.O.)

...Green tried to stonewall her.

SCOTT

And you're not going to get away

with this! I will see to it that you

do not get away with this!

ACE (V.O.)

So...

ACE (V.O.)

...she sued him in court.

JUDGE

The court will now hear the matter

of the plaintiff, Anna Scott, against

Tangiers Corporation and its

president, Philip Green.

LAWYER #1

Good morning, your Honor. John Momet

on behalf of Mr Green.

LAWYER #2

Mitchell Logan on behalf of Anna

Scott, your Honor.

JUDGE

Mr Logan, you may proceed.

LAWYER #2

Thank you, Judge.

SCOTT

I believe he was absolutely fair and

I'm delighted with the decision.

NANCE

(Into telephone)

We got a problem.

NANCE

(Over telephone)

It didn't go too well.

NANCE

(As GREEN and his

lawyers walk past

him, exiting the

court-house)

Green has to open up the books...

has to show how he got the financing.

And, hey, that's - that's not good.

GAGGI

Shit.

NICKY (V.O.)

She was doin' pretty good with her

lawsuit, but before she could start

countin' her money, the boys back

home decided to settle the case out

of court instead.

NICKY (V.O.)

So, they send me.

REPORTER #1

Can you comment on the murder of

Anna Scott?

GREEN

What are you talking about?

REPORTER #1 (O.S.)

She was found last night, shot in

the head.

REPORTER #2 (O.S.)

Was this just a real-estate

partnership?

REPORTER #3 (O.S.)

Her lawyer said you were partners.

GREEN

We were - We were involved in minor

real estate deals many years ago.

It was never a partnership.

REPORTER #1

Police are calling this a mob-style

killing.

REPORTER #2

Did you ever hear of the twenty-two-

caliber killer?

GREEN

I'm a little in shock, quite

frankly...

ACE (V.O.)

Now, instead of the cops only lookin'

at Nicky, they started looking at

Green too. And he was supposed to be

our squeaky...

ACE (V.O.)

...clean front man. So, I had to

start giving interviews to make sure

everybody knew the casino was on the

up and up.

REPORTER

So, actually, how often do you really

fill in for him?

SHERBERT

(to REPORTER, who

looks his way.)

Green's here about two or three times

a month, and he's busy -

(REPORTER glances

back at ACE.)

- with other real-estate deals and -

and things, you know.

REPORTER

(To ACE)

So, in Green's absence, then, you're

the boss.

ACE

I serve at the pleasure of the

chairman of the board and... my, uh,

responsibilities are to run the day-

to-day operations.

REPORTER

So, day-to-day, then, you're the

boss?

ACE

Well, in a sense, you could say

that... I am the boss, when Mr Green

is away. You could say that.

WEBB (O.S.)

Hm. Have you read this?

WEBB (O.S.)

Hm? It's 'bout Mr Rothstein.

WEBB

It says

(Reading)

'The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties

says that he is the real boss of the

new hundred-million-dollar Tangiers

Casino empire.'

(To DUPREY and AUSTIN)

You believe that?

DUPREY

Did he really say that?

WEBB

Why, of course, he really said that.

It's right here. Has that man even

filed for his license yet?

AUSTIN

I don't know. We'll have to check

the files.

WEBB

Well, without gettin' your shorts in

a knot, would you do that? And kinda

check closely, 'cause we may have to

kick a kike's ass out of town.  Thank

you.

away. What about the Chez Paree?

No, you, you can't. You gotta make a

NICKY

No, no it's okay.

It's impossible. It's booked up, and

you gotta make a reservation.  It's...

NICKY

NEWSCASTER

The battle between...

NEWSCASTER

(On television)

...state gaming officials and Tangiers

Casino boss Sam 'Ace' Rothstein is

heating up. Tonight, an up-to-the-

minute look at Ace Rothstein's attempt

to get state licensing despite law

enforcement allegations of Rothstein's

organized crime connections. Will

Sam Rothstein's friendship with

alleged organized crime figure Nicky

Santoro keep Rothstein from running

the Tangiers Casino?  And can the

integrity of state gaming laws be

jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

ACE

(Quietly)

Why don't you take it easy with that

stuff? Huh?  Come on. Let me help

you. Come on. We're talkin' about

some stuff.

NEWSCASTER

(On television)

State officials say 'yes' when that

relationship and those connections

are with anyone as notorious as Nicky

Santoro.

NEWSCASTER

Tonight at six: 'Will a boyhood

friendship unseat Rothstein as the

Tangiers' Casino boss?' Exclusive on

the KVVO Special News Report.

(Reading commercial.)

...Promise to keep my money fears

away?

ACE

(To GINGER)

Just go downstairs.  Just... go downst-

NEWSCASTER

(On television,

continuing commercial)

Promise to be financially secure?

Money Time can help you keep those

promises.

CHARLIE CLARK

You can't let this concern you, Ace.

Don't worry about that stuff.

CHARLIE CLARK (O.S.)

It's just a political witch hunt.

NICKY

Hey, Ace.

ACE

Hey.

ACE

Want something to drink? Charlie you

want a refill?

CHARLIE CLARK

Yeah, refill'd be great.

NICKY

(Approaching CHARLIE)

No, I don't want one.

(Smiling, extends his

hand.)

Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?

CHARLIE CLARK

(Shaking hands)

Hi. Good.

NICKY

(Sitting down with

him on a couch)

I've been trying to reach you.

You're tougher to get than the

President.

CHARLIE CLARK

Well, I've been busy.

(Chuckles.)

NICKY

Yeah, least you could do is return

my phone calls, though.

CHARLIE CLARK

Listen... Nicky... we talked about

this... and, uh, I explained to you

that there was the possibility you

might have to take some kind of loss.

NICKY

Yeah.

(Pause.)

I think I want my money back.

CHARLIE CLARK

(Chuckling)

What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?

NICKY

You know... I think that you've gotten

the wrong impression about me. I

think in all fairness, I should

explain to you what it is that I do.

For instance, tomorrow morning I'll

get up nice and early, take a walk

down over to the bank and walk in

and see you, and, uh... if you don't

have my money for me, I'll crack

your fuckin' head wide open in front

of everybody in the the bank. And

just about the time that I'm comin'

out of jail, hopefully, you'll be

comin' out of your coma. And guess

what?  I'll split your fuckin' head

open again. Because I'm fuckin'

stupid. I don't give a fuck about

jail.  That's my business. That's

what I do. And we know what you do,

don't we, Charlie? You fuck people

out of money and get away with it.

CHARLIE CLARK

(As he puts a notepad

in his briefcase)

You can't talk to me like...

NICKY

(Grabbing CHARLIE by

his jacket)

Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my

fuckin' money to sleep. You go get

my money, or I'll put your fuckin'

brain to sleep.

CHARLIE CLARK

(To ACE, panting)

Sam?

NICKY

Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is

personal.

(Walking with CHARLIE

to the stairs.)

I'll be there in the morning. You

can fuckin' try me, fatso.

NICKY

You fuckin' try me.

NICKY

You think he got the point?

ACE

(Walking to NICKY)

What're you doin'? He's a square

guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat

him like that. He's gonna run to the

FBI.

NICKY

Fuck the FBI! That prick's been

dodging me for three weeks. And what

is it with you?  All of a sudden,

you're tryin' to tell me what to do

all the time.

ACE

I'm not tryin' to tell you what to

do. But you were way out of line,

Nick. What're you doin'? Where's

your head?

NICKY

Where's my head? Where's your fuckin'

balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to

put somethin' really big together

out here. You know what I'm talkin'

about, huh? You know!  If you're

actin' like this now, how can I depend

on you?  There's a lot of things

gonna change out here. And if you

wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're

gonna have to go my fuckin' way.

ACE

Listen, Nick, you gotta understand

my situation. I'm responsible for

thousands of people. I got a hundred

million a year goin' through the

place.  It's all over, I'm gonna

tell you, it's all over, if I don't

get that license.  And believe me,

if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go

bad for a lot of people, you

understand?

NICKY

Yeah, forget about your fuckin'

license. I plant my own flag out

here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin'

license.

(Pause.)

You know, I don't know what it is,

Sammy, but the more I talk to you,

the more I feel like you just don't

wanna go along with me, is that it?

ACE

No, I don't wanna come -

NICKY

You should say so.

ACE

I don't wanna come along with you.

NICKY

Just say so.

ACE

I'll be honest with you.

NICKY

All right, fine.

ACE

I don't wanna be involved in anything

you're talkin' about...

NICKY

Fine.

ACE

...okay? I just wanna run a square

joint. That's it. I just want my

license. I want everything nice and

quiet. That's it.

NICKY

(Holding up the

magazine)

You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the

boss.'  That's quiet?

ACE

That's all taken out of context.

Okay.

NICKY

Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.

ACE

I have no control over that. Ronnie

and Billy were right there. They'll

tell you exactly what happened.

NICKY

Well, back home they don't know about

fuckin' control. That looks bad.

ACE

Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what

looks bad.

NICKY

Yeah?

ACE

Every time you're on television I

get mentioned. That looks bad. That

looks bad.

NICKY

What the fuck happened to you? Will

you tell me?

ACE

What happened to me? What happened

to you?

NICKY

Yeah.

ACE

You lost your control.

NICKY

I lost control?

ACE

Yes, you lost your control.

NICKY

Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin'

around like John Barrymore.

ACE

All right.

NICKY

A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...

ACE

All right.

NICKY

...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I

lost control?!

ACE

Yeah.

NICKY

You know, I didn't want to bring

this up, but you have treating a lot

of people with a lot of disrespect.

Even your own wife.

ACE

My wife?

NICKY

Yeah.

ACE

Now, what does she have to do with

all this?

NICKY

Well, she comes to see me. She was

upset about a lot of things,

especially that whole fuckin' Diamond -

that Lester Diamond incident.

ACE

All of a sudden, you're the shoulder

to cry on? Did you at least tell her

about your little role in that whole

situation?

NICKY

No, I didn't. What good would that

do? That's not the fuckin' point.

ACE

Listen, I would -

NICKY

(Interrupting)

The point is that she's upset. She's -

and you got a fuckin' problem.

ACE

I - I would appreciate it if you'd

stay out of my personal life, okay?

You wouldn't like it if I did it to

you.

NICKY

Hey, she came to talk...

ACE

Please...

NICKY

...to me.

ACE

...don't do it to me...

NICKY

She came to talk to me...

ACE

Okay?

NICKY

And I - what was I supposed to do,

throw her out?

ACE

Ju-just stay away from her. It's

none of your business, okay? There

are certain things you don't do, and

you know that.

NICKY

It's none of my business?

ACE

That's right, yeah.

NICKY

A week ago it was my business, now

it's none of my business. In other

words, when you need me to take care

of somethin' for you, then you need

me.

ACE

Yeah, that's right, the way you need

me to vouch for you as a citizen and

get you out of one of your jams. I'm

gonna have to straighten out what

you just did with this guy.

ACE

This guy is gonna run to the FBI.

NICKY

Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger

than your casino. That's your problem,

pal.

ACE (V.O.)

I knew what he wanted, and I didn't

want any part of it.

NICKY

(Walking to the glass

doors leaving ACE

standing there)

Fuckin' walking around with a big

head. You better check yourself...

ACE (V.O.)

Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted

to go after Gaggi, go after the skim,

go after everything and everybody.

ACE (V.O.)

Plus, he had stopped askin' permission

from back home for every little thing.

ACE (V.O.)

A casino boss and his wife were

killed. The bulls questioned Nicky.

ACE (V.O.)

A dealer from the Sirocco... they

questioned Nicky.

ACE (V.O.)

A bunch of stool pigeons wound in

the trunks of their cars... they

questioned Nicky.

ACE (V.O.)

A lawyer... they questioned Nicky.

ACE (V.O.)

And when some guys who didn't pay

their Shylocks began disappearing,

Nicky's name was in every one of

those newspapers.

ACE (V.O.)

Nicky was questioned in two dozen

murders, but they always had to let

him go. There were never any

witnesses.

NICKY (V.O.)

The coppers blamed me for everything

that went wrong out here, and I mean

every little fuckin' thing too.

NICKY

(To photographer)

Watch yourself. You're gonna get

runned over there.

NICKY (V.O.)

If a guy fuckin' tripped over a

fuckin' banana peel, they'd bring me

in for it.

NICKY

(To reporters)

Come on, huh. That's enough now. Be

nice, huh? Be nice.

NICKY (V.O.)

And the bosses were no better. I

mean, they complained day and night

because things don't run smooth.

Well, in my line of work, things

don't run so smooth, I'm sorry. I

mean, I'm dealing with degenerate

animals out here. But the bosses,

what do they give a fuck? They're

sittin' on their asses, drinkin'

anisette. Meanwhile, I'm the guy in

the trenches. Fuckin' bosses, they

think it's a fuckin' free lunch out

here.

GAGGI

(Ignoring the money)

Frankie... they found a guy's head

in the desert. Do you know about

that?

MARINO

Yeah, I heard, yeah.

GAGGI

Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it.

They're makin' a big deal out of it.

MARINO

I know.

GAGGI

It's in all the papers.

MARINO

What're you gonna do?

GAGGI

And I mean... that's no good.

MARINO

I know.

GAGGI

You gotta tell him... to take care

of things a little better.

MARINO

I'll tell him, Remo.

NICKY (V.O.)

Fuckin'...

NICKY (V.O.)

...bosses. I mean, they're smokin'

their Di Nobilis and they're eatin'

a trippa [Italian-American slang for

'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you

know, fried pigs guts? While, if I

wanna talk private, I gotta go to a

fuckin' bus stop.

NICKY

(To MARINO)

But, hey, what do they care, as long

as I keep sendin' money back.

MARINO

Yeah, but they're complaining.

NICKY

Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's

here.

NICKY

I do all the work. Somebody don't

like it, fuck him.

MARINO

It's up to you.

NICKY

They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.

NICKY

I know one thing. All I gotta do is

take care of four or five of those

fuckin' guys, the rest will fall

right into place. Believe me.

NICKY (V.O.)

Peekaboo, you fucks, you.

NICKY

I see you, you motherfuckers.

ACE (V.O.)

The problem was, Nicky was not only

bringin' heat on himself, but on me

too. The FBI watched every move he

made. But he didn't care. He just

didn't care.

NICKY (V.O.)

If they're gonna watch me, fuck 'em,

I'm gonna watch 'em right back. I

spent a few dollars. Top dollar, who

gives a shit?

NICKY (V.O.)

I got the latest anti-buggin'

equipment from the same places that

sell to the fuckin' CIA. I had all

the special police frequency radios,

FBI descramblers, cameras that see

in the dark, and because of that,

the miserable sons-of-bitches that

they are, they never once caught me

doin' anything I couldn't handle.

ACE (V.O.)

I got my job...

ACE (V.O.)

...on the line and this guy's out

havin' the time of his life. He has

every cop in the state watchin' him,

and he's out playin' golf.

NICKY

Practice enough this week, you prick?

ACE (V.O.)

And at the...

ACE (V.O.)

...worst possible time for me.

AUSTIN

A record of the arrests...

ACE (V.O.)

I had my license hearing coming up

and I didn't wanna leave anything to

chance.

ACE

That was nineteen years ago, and

they were simple gambling pinches.

ACE (V.O.)

I mean, if I can't work in Vegas,

where am I gonna go?

AUSTIN

You've been very open with us. I

mean, uh, your books and papers and...

that - that's gonna mean something

when you go before the Commission.

ACE

Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a

fair hearing.

DUPREY

Well, this kind of honesty will

guarantee that fair hearing.

ACE

Good.

AUSTIN

All right, well, we'll move on to -

AUSTIN (O.S.)

(As he looks at the

plane)

I wanted to hear something about...

Kansas City.

NICKY

(Looking at the

airplane)

What the fuck is this? Where's this

fuckin' guy gonna land, on the

fairway?

NICKY

(To MARINO)

They're fuckin' agents, Frankie.

Look at this.

ACE (V.O.)

The Feds were watchin' Nicky play

golf for so long, they ran out of

gas. Just what I needed. Right in

front on the Control Board.

NICKY

A hundred dollars, whoever hits the

plane.

ACE (V.O.)

(putting his sunglasses

back on)

And, as if things weren't bad

enough...

ACE (V.O.)

...in comes Piscano, the Kansas City

underboss. He ran that little grocery

store in Kansas City where they

brought the suitcases.

PISCANO

They're fightin' over those suitcases

again. You know what that means,

right? You know what that means,

right? That means I gotta take another

trip out to Vegas, and it's gonna

cost me another couple of grand.

ACE (V.O.)

He ran it with his brother-in-law,

but mostly what he did was complain,

complain about his trips to Vegas,

to his brother-in-law and to his

mother, all the time.

BROTHER-IN-LAW

(Seated)

You gotta lay down the law. Otherwise

they're gonna make a fool out of

you.

PISCANO

They're not gonna make a fool out of

me. I write it all down in this book,

(holding up a notepad)

every fuckin' nickel that goes down.

Right here, receipts...

PISCANO'S MOTHER

(Chastising her son)

Hey! Oh!

PISCANO

Oh, sorry -

PISCANO'S MOTHER

What's the matter with you?

PISCANO

Receipts and bills and... everything's

here.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

Since when do you talk like that?

PISCANO

I'm sorry.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

There's a lot of people here.

PISCANO

Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell

him... screw around with those

suitcases and I'll take the eyes out

of his frickin' head.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

Again!

PISCANO

I didn't curse. I said 'frickin'

head'.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

That's enough.

PISCANO

I'm sorry.

ACE (V.O.)

And what happens next?

ACE (V.O.)

You can't believe it. I mean, who

the hell would believe that the FBI

had a wire in the place lookin' for

some information about some old

homicide about some guy who was

whacked-out, God knows when, over

God knows what?

PISCANO

Plus, what's to prevent him with the

suitcases, that he can take what he

wants?  Fuckin' Nance, he brings us

back two suitcases from the Tangiers,

and what about three or four?

PISCANO

We got nobody in the room to watch.

That's the law. You know, we can't

even go into the count room to watch

our money? Could you believe this

cowboy bullshit?

PISCANO

And sure he's got his people in there.

But how do you know? They could all

be in on it together, those miserable

fucks.

PISCANO

I'll find out and, if it's Green

himself, I'll bury that bastard.

PISCANO

(Over transmitter)

I've never trusted him. And you know

I got eyes...

PISCANO

...behind my head. They trust that

scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way

I feel, I'll hit the two of them in

the head with a fuckin' shovel.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

All right, take it easy now, take it

easy.

PISCANO

Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me

left and right.

(Knocking down some

bottles of olive

oil.)

Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

(Tapping the counter)

I know, but that's enough.

PISCANO

You know - You know - You know what

they're doin' to me?

PISCANO'S MOTHER

I know it, I know it.

PISCANO

I can't take this no more. Back and

forth, back and forth.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

Take it easy, though.

PISCANO

All right, all right. But I - I -

PISCANO'S MOTHER

You'll get a heart attack like that.

PISCANO

You know, I - I'm too upset right

now. And - An end has to be put to

this.

ACE (V.O.)

And the damn...

ACE (V.O.)

...thing is, they go and hear all

this stuff about Las Vegas and the

casinos and the suitcases, and that's

it.

PISCANO (O.S.)

If I have to start handlin' things

the way I...

PISCANO

(Over transmitter)

...did years ago, start kickin' ass,

I - I'll do it, and I'll use the

goddamn shovel!  I mean, I...

PISCANO'S MOTHER

(Over transmitter)

You are right.

PISCANO

(Over transmitter)

...everything's comin' out of my

pocket. I gotta pay for all these

trips back and forth, back and forth.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

(Over transmitter)

You are right. What can I...

PISCANO'S MOTHER

(On tape recorder)

...tell you.

ACE (V.O.)

Would you believe that such a thing

could happen?

PISCANO

(On tape recorder)

I'm in this to make money, not to

lose money.  And...

ACE (V.O.)

Every FBI man across the country had

their ears open now.

PISCANO

(On tape recorder)

Because...

PISCANO

(On tape recorder)

...if you want somethin'...

PISCANO

(On tape recorder)

...done right, you gotta do it

yourself.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

(On tape recorder)

Then do it the way you want.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

(On tape recorder)

What can I tell you?

ACE (V.O.)

I mean...

ACE (V.O.)

...Piscano, this guy basically...

ACE

...sunk the whole world.

PISCANO'S MOTHER

(On tape recorder)

That's the way people are. There are

some that are good and some that are

bad.

OSCAR

Mr Chairman and members of the

Commission. Mr Rothstein is pleased

to be here today.

ACE (V.O.)

And when the day finally came, I was

ready. I felt so confident that all

I had to do was present my case.

OSCAR

...evidence... and we have documents,

one of which is a report by retired

FBI agents, which completely absolves

(holding up a large

file folder)

Mr Rothstein from any wrongdoing.

I'd like this marked, please, Mr

Chairman.

SENATOR

(Into microphone)

Pardon me, counselor. Before you

continue...

OSCAR

No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -

SENATOR

(Into microphone)

...this, uh, this Commission is

prepared to act on a motion denying

the Rothstein application.

OSCAR

Denying?

SENATOR

(Into microphone)

Do I hear a motion seconded?

OSCAR

Mr. Chairman -

CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #1

(Into microphone)

Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

SENATOR

(Into microphone)

Do I have a vote on the motion?

OSCAR

Mr. Chairman -

CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #2

(Into microphone)

Aye.

CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #3

(Into microphone)

Aye.

CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #4

(Into microphone)

Aye.

SENATOR

(Into microphone)

The ayes have it. This hearing is

adjourned.

ACE

(Getting up)

You guys have to be kidding.

ACE

Adjourned! What do you mean,

adjourned?

OSCAR

Mr. Chairman, please.

ACE

Mr. Chairman...

ACE

Senator, you promised me a hearing.

ACE

You won't allow me a hearing? You

didn't even look at the FBI reports.

ACE

When you were my guest, Mr. Chairman,

Senator, at the Tangiers Hotel, did

you not promise me that I would have

a fair hearing -

SENATOR

(Interrupting, into

microphone)

I was never - I was never your guest

at the Tangiers.

ACE

You were never my guest?!

SENATOR

(Into microphone)

That's right.

ACE

I never comped you?! I don't comp

you at least two or three times a

month at the Tangiers?!

SENATOR

(Into microphone)

Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer -

answer that at this time.

ACE

Liar.

SENATOR

(Into microphone)

Mr Rothstein is being very typical

to this point.

ACE

He's lying.

SENATOR

The only time I was at the Tangiers

was when I had dinner with Barney

Greenstein.

ACE

Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -

SENATOR

You were wandering around.

ACE

Was I at that dinner?

SENATOR

You were wandering around.

ACE

Was I at that dinner?

SENATOR

You were wandering around.

ACE

Was I at that dinner?

SENATOR

You were in the m- You were in the

building.

ACE

I was in the building!

ACE

You know damn well I was at that

dinner, and you swore to me that I

would have a fair hearing at that

dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!

(Pause, ACE looks at

OSCAR.)

Well, tell me I was at least at the

dinner! A-allow me that much.

(Pause.)

Give me that much at least!

SENATOR

(Hesitates)

Yes, you were.

ACE

Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a

liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of-

a

FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige

Novodor.

(On television.)

What should have been a routine

licensing hearing turned into bedlam

yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers

Casino executive, Sam

FEMALE NEWSCASTER

(Overlapping)

...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the

state's top gaming officials of

corruption.

ACE

(Overlapping)

What are you running for, Bob? What

are you running for?

FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

(Overlapping)

...and hypocrisy.

ACE

(Into two reporters'

microphones)

Don't you remember? You promised me

a fair hearing when you were gettin'

comped at my hotel and you were asking

me for copies of your bills so -

ACE

- you could put 'em on your expense

account?

FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

In a

(on television)

Wild and unprecedented outburst that

followed his gaming license

(voice-over,

overlapping)

denial, Rothstein followed several...

ACE

(With several

reporters, overlapping)

Bullshit! Bullshit!

FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

...stunned commissioners into the

hallway, where he continued his

harangue until his own lawyers and

friends urged him to leave.

ACE

(To COMMISSIONERS

standing in the

hallway, speaking

into a TV news

microphone)

We all have a past. You have a past,

I have a past. And my past is no

worse than yours. But you guys think

you have the right to pass judgement

on me.

FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

(Overlapping)

Long suspected of running the Tangiers

without...

ACE

(Overlapping)

...twenty years in order to find

nothin' on me -

ACE

- unsubstantiated truths on me. And

if you look at your own lives you'd

all be in jail.

FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

(Overlapping)

...a gaming license, yesterday's

hearing was to determine whether

someone with Rothstein's checkered

personal history was qualified to

officially hold the top gaming post.

ACE (V.O.)

(from previous scene

continued)

Fuckin' hypocrites!

GAGGI

What the hell's he gonna do now?

STONE

I don't know

(Sighs.)

GAGGI

What's he doin'? He knows all those

guys he yelled at are friends of

ours. What's the matter with him,

making all this mess?

STONE

Maybe he could run things with another

job title. Wouldn't be the best,

but, uh, what are we gonna do?

GAGGI

However he runs things, it's gotta

be quiet. Let him hide upstairs in

the office. Say he's the janitor, I

don't give a shit. But, please,

whatever job he takes, make sure

it's something quiet.

TRUDY (O.S.)

Ladies and gentlemen, the Tangiers

Hotel proudly presents the all-new

Sam Rothstein Show, Aces High.

TRUDY (O.S.)

Tonight, taped live from the all-new

sportsbook, we present the premiere

showing of Aces High. With the...

TRUDY

(Into microphone)

...Sasha Semenoff Orchestra...

TRUDY

...and the Sam Rothstein Dancers.

TRUDY

Mr Rothstein is a professional gambler

and the best football handicapper...

TRUDY

...in American, a man who will take

you inside the real Las Vegas as no

one has ever done before. And now,

ladies and gentlemen, the new...

TRUDY

...Entertainment Director of the

Tangiers Hotel Casino: Mr Sam

Rothstein.

ACE

(Seated at a desk a

la Johnny Carson)

Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show.

We're very happy to have you here

this evening. The young lady to my

left is Trudy, who is a lead new

dancer in our fabulous show from

Paris.

ACE

Our first guest this evening... is

Frankie Avalon.

WEBB

Keep an eye on him.

FRANKIE AVALON (O.S.)

...Well, I've got a large family.

ACE

(Into microphone)

How many kids do you have?

FRANKIE AVALON

(Into microphone)

Uh, I'm very proud to say that we

have eight children.

ACE

(Into microphone)

Eight children!

(He encourages the

audience to applaud.)

FRANKIE AVALON

(Into microphone)

No, no, no, no, please, please,

please, please, no, please.

ACE

(Into microphone, to

audience)

That's amazing.

FRANKIE AVALON

(Into microphone)

There was nothing to it.

(Chuckles)

It was my pleasure.

GREEN

Ace, don't do it.

GREEN

Oh, no, no. No, no. Oh, Jesus...

he's juggling!

ACE (O.S.)

(From next scene)

Let's not take County Commissioner

Pat Webb too seriously.

ACE

(Into microphone)

I recently challenged him to a debate

on this program and he declined.

What are you worried about, Pat?

You don't have to send me any

questions. You can ask me anything

you want.

STONE (O.S.)

(From next scene)

What the hell is he doin' on

television, anyway?

STONE

He's on all night, screamin' about

how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit

all the way to the Supreme Court. He

really must be crazy. He's gonna go

to Washington with this?

(Chuckles.)

He's out of his fuckin' mind.

ACE (O.S.)

(From next scene)

It's a pity in this...

ACE

(Into microphone)

...state that we have such hypocrisy.

Some people can do whatever they

want. Other people have to pay through

the nose.

ACE (O.S.)

(From previous scene)

But such is life.

GAGGI

Andy, go see him. Tell him maybe

it's time he should quit.

ACE

First of all, what they did was

totally unconstitutional. We're

already on the list to be heard before

the Supreme Court of the United States

later this year.

STONE

These guys back home don't give a

fuck about the Supreme Court and any

of this bullshit! They want things

to quiet down. They want you to walk

away from -

ACE

Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious.

How can I walk away? Don't you see

what's goin' on here? Don't you see

what's at stake?

STONE

The old man said, 'Maybe your friend

should give in.'  And when the old

man says 'maybe', that's like a papal

bull. Not only should you quit, you

should run!

ACE

Know what my problem is? Every time

they mention my name in the papers,

these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky,

too. How the fuck does that help?  I

mean, the heat he brought down is

murder!  We had a police department

who was cooperative. He's pissed

them off so much now that nobody can

make a move anymore. I mean, what do

you do about that?

STONE

What do you propose?

ACE

I don't know, he doesn't listen to

me. Maybe he should...  get lost for

a while. Take a vacation. Would that

be so bad?

STONE

They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.

ACE

All right, look, if he took a break,

it would just give everybody some

time to maneuver. That's all I'm

saying. It's all that I'm saying.

STONE

I would forget about the maneuver. I

would just get out.

ACE

(Sighs)

I can't do that.

ACE (V.O.)

Of course...

JENNIFER

(Into telephone)

You know, I don't feel like playin'

tennis.

ACE (V.O.)

...as soon as Andy got back home,

Nicky heard about our talk in the

car.

JENNIFER

(Into telephone)

Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go

to the Riviera?

ACE (V.O.)

Next morning bright and early, I get

the call.

GINGER

(Over telephone)

One o'clock?

JENNIFER

(Over telephone)

Great.

GINGER

(Into telephone)

You know, I've got to do some shopping

afterwards. Do you want to go?

JENNIFER

(Into telephone)

Well, you know...

ACE (V.O.)

But just getting a call from Nicky

wasn't easy anymore. Even the codes

didn't work. So, we figured out

another act.

ACE (V.O.)

You see, if a phone's tapped, the

Feds can only listen in...

ACE (V.O.)

...on the stuff involving crimes. So

on...

ACE (V.O.)

...routine calls, they have to click

off after a few minutes.

GINGER

(Over telephone)

Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin'

elbow.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Yeah.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

Meet me at three.

ACE

(Into telephone)

What - what, Caesar's?

NICKY

(Over telephone)

No, a...

NICKY

(Into telephone)

...hundred yards further down the

road.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Why?

NICKY

(Into telephone)

Don't ask questions. Just be there.

NICKY

(To himself)

Always asking questions.

JENNIFER

(Into telephone)

Suzy Creamcheese has the exact...

JENNIFER

(Over telephone)

...same outfit.

GINGER

(Chuckles, over

telephone)

But I saw something...

GINGER

(Into telephone)

...something very... cute.

FBI AGENT (O.S.)

(Into a radio)

Okay, he, uh, he's out. It's the

ant, uh, Brown unit. And he's with,

uh, bogie. I think it's Frankie.

ACE (V.O.)

Nicky started out before me because

it wasn't that easy...

ACE (V.O.)

...for him to get around anymore.

FBI AGENT

(Into radio)

Okay, pulled out...

FBI AGENT (O.S.)

(Into radio)

...pretty fast. He's headed upstream.

ACE (V.O.)

Nicky couldn't even go for a ride

without changing...

ACE (V.O.)

...cars at least six times before he

could shake all his tails.

ACE (V.O.)

And because of all the planes, he

had to use underground garages.

ACE (V.O.)

Meeting in the middle of the desert

always made me nervous.

ACE (V.O.)

Normally, my prospects of comin'

back alive from a meeting with Nicky

were ninety-nine out of a hundred.

But this time, when I heard him say,

'A couple a hundred yards down the

road', I gave myself fifty-fifty.

NICKY

Where the fuck you get off talkin'

to people about me behind my back?

Goin' over my head?

ACE

What people?

NICKY

What people! What'd you think, I

wasn't gonna find out?

ACE

I don't even know what you're talkin'

about, Nick.

NICKY

No? You said I'm bringin' heat on

you?! I gotta listen to people because

of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering

me out?! You better get your own

fuckin' army, pal!

ACE

I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't

order you or anybody...  I only told

Andy Stone that you had a lot of

heat on you, and that was a problem.

NICKY

You want me to get out of my own

fuckin' town?!

ACE

Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit

blow over for a while so I can run

the casino. Anything goes wrong with

the casino, it's my ass. It's not

yours, it's my ass.

NICKY

Oh, I don't know whether you know

this or not, but you only have your

fuckin' casino because I made that

possible!

ACE

I -

NICKY

(Interrupting)

I'm what counts out here! Not your

fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin'

TV shows! And what the fuck are you

doin' on TV anyhow?!

ACE

What are you -

NICKY

(Interrupting)

You know I get calls from back home

every fuckin' day?!  They think you

went batshit!

ACE

I'm only on TV because I gotta be

able to hang around the casino. You

understand that. You know that. Come

on.

NICKY

Your fuckin' ass! You could have had

the food and beverage job without

goin' on television!  You wanted to

go on TV.

ACE

Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That

way I have a forum. I can fight back.

I'm known. People see me. They know

they can't fuck around with me like

they could if I was an unknown. That's

right.

NICKY

You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle

of yourself.

ACE

Me?! I wouldn't even be in this

situation if it wasn't for you. You

brought down so much fuckin' heat on

me. I mean, every time I meet somebody

here, the big question is do I know

you.

NICKY

Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your

fuckin' license on me, is that it?

ACE

No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked

me if you could come out here, what

did I tell you? I mean, you asked

me, and I knew you were going to

come out no matter what I said, but

what did I tell you? Do you remember

what I told...

NICKY

(Interrupting)

Back -

ACE

...you? Do you remember what I told

you?

NICKY

Back - Back up, back up a fuckin'

minute here. One minute. I asked

you?! When the fuck did I ever ask

you if I could come out here?! Get

this through your head, you -

ACE

(Interrupting)

You never - ?

NICKY

Get this through your head, you Jew

motherfucker, you. You only exist

out here because of me!  That's the

only reason!  Without me, you,

personally, every fuckin' wiseguy

skell [Skell: the lowest form of

wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll

take a piece of your fuckin' Jew

ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're

fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over

my fuckin' head again! You

motherfucker, you!

MARINO

Well, we got company.

NICKY

Do you see that? Dumb Jew

motherfucker. Grew up together and

he's actin' like he don't even know

me. I know we're supposed to avoid

each other, but, you know, there's

ways to do things and there's ways

not to.

DOMINICK

Yeah. Fuck him.

SHERBERT

To Abraham Lincoln.

ACE

L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']

SHERBERT

Here we go. Good luck.

DOMINICK

Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it

bother you.

NICKY

Why, does it look like it's bothering

me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin'

Oscar too. All the fuckin' money

I've given that prick, he don't even

look over here. What's his problem?

MARINO

Mm.

NICKY

Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't

they?

MARINO

They're havin' a good time too.

NICKY

So are we.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Yeah?

SHERBERT

(Quietly into telephone)

Sam, we got a problem.

ACE

(Into telephone)

What is it?

SHERBERT

(Over telephone)

The little guy. He's half in the

bag, and nobody told him he was eighty-

sixed from the joint, so we...

SHERBERT

(Into telephone)

...all turned our heads and made out

like we didn't know who he was. He's

over at the twenty-one table with

his...

SHERBERT

...nose wide open. He took the money

out of his own kick. His nose is

open for about ten thousand.

SHERBERT (O.S.)

Now, he's really pissed.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Oh, no.

SHERBERT

(Into telephone)

He wants a fifty-thousand marker.

ACE

(Into telephone)

No, just - just give him, give him

ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right

down.

SHERBERT

(To NICKY)

He's gonna come up with ten thousand,

just the way you wanted.

NICKY

Ten thou? No, no, no.

SHERBERT

...give you ten thousand -

NICKY

(Grabbing SHERBERT's

lapel)

Fifty! I said fifty!

SHERBERT

Look, take -

NICKY

(Pushing him away and

walking back to the

blackjack table)

Fuckin' fifty thousand!  Go get it.

I don't give a fuck where you get

it.

(To FEMALE DEALER.)

Fuckers!  They take it, but they

don't want to give it back.

NICKY

How the fuck can you grin? How the

fuck could you grin?

NICKY

You know how much I'm stuck? You

give a fuck?

NICKY

Do ya?!

NICKY

(To departing FEMALE

DEALER)

Yeah. Give yourself a hand right

across your fuckin' mouth.

NICKY

Look at this fuckin' beaut they put

in now. Sherbert send you in here to

rob me now? Been fuckin' knockin'

everybody's dick in all night? Huh?

You been beatin' all the customers

tonight, motherfucker?

NICKY

Huh, jag-off? Hit me.

NICKY

Take this stiff and pound it up your

fuckin' ass! Hit me again.

NICKY

Take this one and stick it up your

sister's ass! Hit me again.

NICKY

That's it, keep lookin' at him, you

fuckin' dummy. If you had any fuckin'

heart at all, you'd be out fuckin'

stealin' for a livin'.

(Tossing the card at

the DEALER.)

Hit me again.

NICKY

What the fuck you keep lookin' at

him for, huh, you fuckin' pu-

NICKY

Look at this, twenty fuckin' paints

in a row. Hit me again!

MARINO

(To NICKY)

He's here.

NICKY

(To the DEALER)

You should pay as fast as you collect,

you know.

ACE

What are you doin'? You gotta get

out of here!

NICKY

Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker

over here to pay that marker.

ACE

Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin'

to me. I'm here to help you. What's

the matter with you?  You're gonna

bury us both.

NICKY

Just give me the money. Fuckin' give

me the fuckin' money, Sammy.

ACE

I'm gonna okay you ten and get you

even, and that's it. Then you got to

get out of here before the cops and

the newspapers are all over you.

ACE

Ten and that's it.

NICKY

What are you starin' at, you bald-

headed Jew prick?!

NICKY

Sue me, you Jew fuck!

MARINO

Let's get out of here.

NICKY

What? Get out of here? I got a marker

comin'.

NICKY

(To DEALER)

Deal.

OSCAR

I know, but everything's changed

now. You're talking about a divorce.

You're even asking for alimony

payments and... child support... and

now custody.

GINGER

I just want what any divorced woman

would get.

ACE

I mean she's only sober about two

hours a day. It's usually from eleven

in the morning until one in the

afternoon. And if I gave her her

money and her jewels now, you know

what she's gonna do? She's gonna

piss it all away in about a year,

and then where will she be?

(To GINGER.)

Where would you be then? Comin' right

back to me, right back to me.

(To OSCAR.)

Or finding some other excuse to come

and I - I -

GINGER

(To ACE)

We had a deal. Remember that?

(To OSCAR.)

He said if it didn't work out between

us, that I could get my things and I

could leave.

ACE

(To GINGER, leaning

closer to her)

Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.

ACE

You know me. Do you see anything in

these eyes that makes you think I

would ever let someone in your

condition take my child away from

me?

(Pause.)

Do you?  You know that won't happen.

ACE (V.O.)

And after all this time... and as

hard as I tried, as much as I

wanted...

ACE (V.O.)

...I could never reach her. I could

never make her love me. I always

felt she should have gone for all

that money... being somebody for the

first time in her life, a home and a

kid. But that's not what happened.

It just didn't work out that way.

ACE

(To the showgirls)

Everything all right?

ACE

I mean, what could we do? After a

while, we'd just take breathers from

each other. You know, little

separations. At that time, I remember

Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly

Hills. She was gonna spend a week or

so shopping.

OPERATOR

(Over telephone)

Yes, Mr Rothstein.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly

Hills, please.

HOTEL OPERATOR (O.S.)

Hello, Beverly Hotel.

ACE (O.S.)

Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.

HOTEL OPERATOR (O.S.)

I'm sorry.  Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein

have checked out already.

LESTER

Hey.

ACE

(Into telephone)

M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?

LESTER

(To AMY)

Hey, little Dale Evans.

HOTEL OPERATOR (O.S.)

Yes, they both checked out.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Thank you.

(He hangs up.)

ACE

(Into telephone)

Hello.

FORLANO

(Over telephone)

Yeah.

ACE

(Into telephone, sighs)

Uh, my wife is w-with an old friend

of her i-in LA.

ACE

(Over telephone)

Some low-life. A guy named Lester

Diamond.

ACE

(Into telephone)

My daughter's with 'em too and I

think they're gonna try and kidnap

her. Is there anybody you can send?

FORLANO

(Into telephone)

We'll take care of it.

COUNT ROOM EXEC

(To ACE)

We got a number and an address.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Hello.

LESTER

(Over telephone)

Hello.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...

ACE

...Rothstein. I want to talk to

Ginger. Put her on the phone.

LESTER

(Into telephone)

She's not here, Sam.

ACE

(Over telephone)

Lester...

ACE

(Into telephone)

...listen to me very carefully. I

want to talk to Ginger. I want my

kid back. I want her put on a plane

immediately.

ACE

(Over telephone)

I know she's there. Don't fuck around

with me.

LESTER

(Into telephone)

Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...

LESTER

...wouldn't do it. Yeah, no, I, I...

GINGER

(Whispering to AMY)

You shouldn't do this.

ACE

(Over telephone)

You understand? Put her on the fuckin'

phone.

LESTER

(Into telephone)

Sam, I - I don't know where she is,

okay?

LESTER

(Over telephone)

So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell

you - can I call you back in a few

minutes?

ACE

(Over telephone)

702 472 1862.

LESTER

Mm-hm.

(Pretending to write

it down.)

1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right

b-

ACE

(Over telephone)

Right away.

LESTER

(Into telephone)

I'll call you right back.

ACE

(Over telephone)

Right back.

LESTER

(Into telephone)

You got it.

(He hangs up; then to

himself as he walks

through a doorway to

the living-room)

Schmuck.

(To GINGER.)

All right. I just bought us a few

minutes. Want to get back at this

prick?

LESTER

Hm?  Okay, you got, what, two million

dollars in that box?

LESTER

Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's

got two million in the box, am I

right?  Okay, you let him keep your

jewels. We take the cash and the

only other thing he cares about.

(He points to AMY.)

Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe.

You dye your hair, get some pl-

AMY

(Interrupts)

I don't want to go to Europe. I want

to go to see The Elephant Man.

LESTER

We're not gonna go see any fuckin'

elephants, okay?

GINGER

(To AMY)

We'll go later.

LESTER

(To AMY)

We're going to Europe. Let the adults

talk.

(To GINGER.)

You dye your hair... you get plastic

surgery, like we talked about. Right?

You're the mother. How much do you

think he's gonna pay to get this

fuckin' kid back?

AMY

I don't want to go to Europe.

LESTER

(To AMY)

Shut your mouth!

LESTER

You know where she gets this from!

AMY

You shut up.

LESTER

No, you - You want me to come over

there? I'll smack your face.

LESTER

Don't give me any of your shit!

(To GINGER.)

Okay, this has always been a dream,

but we're going.

GINGER

Lester - he called you here.

LESTER

Right.

GINGER

Here.

LESTER

He was just on the phone.

GINGER

(Sniffs)

He called you right here.

LESTER

I just talked to him.

GINGER

(Sighs)

So, he knows where you are. That

means he's sending some guys over

here probably right now.

LESTER

Ginger... It means he's sitting by

the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting

for me to call him back. Now, I -

GINGER

(Interrupting and

getting up)

That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the

phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting

for you to call him back. That's

what he's -

LESTER

(Interrupting)

He's sittin' by the phone -

GINGER

(Yelling)

What do you think we're gonna do?

He's probably got guys outside the

fuckin' house!

GINGER

(Gathering AMY,

hysterical)

Get your bag! Come on, get your bag!

Get your things! Let's go!

LESTER

It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit

right here. This is the fuckin'

problem, you know.

GINGER

(Hysterical)

Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want

to fuckin' talk it over now?

LESTER

You're done yakkin', okay? You're

done yakkin' now?

GINGER

(Grabbing her purse

and rushing AMY out)

Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!

LESTER

(Mimicking GINGER)

'Go! Go! Go!'

NICKY

(Into telephone)

You just relax. Nobody's killin'

anybody, do you hear?

GINGER

(Over telephone)

No, I really do. I think he's gonna

kill me.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

You just relax, and call me back

here in exactly an hour, on this

phone, and I'll see what I can do.

GINGER

(Over telephone)

Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.

GINGER

(Into telephone)

So, I'm gonna call you back in an

hour... at this number, and you're

gonna be there, right?

NICKY

(Over telephone)

I'll be there.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

And listen, don't do anything else

crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.

GINGER

(Into telephone)

Bye.

GINGER

Just knock it off! Would you two

knock it off? Get in the car.

LESTER

She started it. She started the whole

thing. I'm just standin' here.

LESTER

You're not gonna drive. Don't even

think you're gonna drive.

GINGER

No, I'm gonna drive.

LESTER

(Stopping GINGER)

No, I'm not gonna drive with some

crazy -

GINGER

(Yelling)

You're driving me nuts!

LESTER

Get in the passenger's side! And I'm

sendin' this kid to Bolivia in a

fuckin' box.

NICKY

Ginger -

NICKY

(After an awkward

moment)

Ginger called me.

ACE

(Polite, careful,

smoking a cigarette)

Yeah.

NICKY

I just told you. She called me.

ACE

And what'd she want?

NICKY

She was afraid to call you.

ACE

Yeah, she's with that cocksucker

again... and they got Amy.

GINGER

Well, that's why I'm here. She wants

to come back, but she's afraid you're

gonna whack her out.

ACE

Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid.

What do you want?

NICKY

I know. Why didn't you come to me? I

mean, this is family, it ain't

business. Meanwhile, you make calls

back home. Sammy, it makes us look

bad out here, you know what I mean?

Back and forth, this one and that

one, and, in the meantime, she's

gone anyway. Am I right?

ACE

(Sighing)

I don't know. What am I gonna do

with this woman? I don't know...

(Pause.)

She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.

NICKY

I think if you, uh, okay it, you

know, assure her that she's gonna be

all right, she'll come back.

ACE

She's driving me fuckin' crazy.

NICKY

Well, once you get her here, you

think about it, you know?  But get

the kid back here. She wants to come

back. That's the, uh, that's the

main thing here. You want your kid,

don't you? Huh?

ACE

(Over telephone)

Hello.

GINGER

(Sighs, into telephone)

Hi, it's me.

(Chuckling.)

Just who you wanted to talk to, right?

ACE

(Over telephone)

Listen...

ACE

(Into telephone)

...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you

where you are, just please, put Amy

on a plane. Just put her on right

away, any plane to get her here right

away...

ACE

(Over telephone)

...please. That's all I'm askin'

you.

GINGER

(Into telephone)

Do you... I mean... I don't think

she should go by herself.

ACE

(Sighs, into telephone)

What do you mean?

GINGER

(Into telephone,

holding back tears)

What I mean is, you think if, uh, do

you think if I came back... do you

think you could forgive me?

ACE

(Into telephone)

Uh,

(sighs)

I don't know. I gotta tell you, I

don't know.

GINGER

(Over telephone)

Right.

GINGER

(Into telephone)

I under-understand that. I-I know I

fucked up.

ACE

(Into telephone)

What about the money? Uh, where's

the box?

GINGER

(Over telephone)

I gotta tell ya...

GINGER

(Into telephone)

...I-I... made some mistakes and I

spent some money.

ACE

(Over telephone)

What's it...

ACE

(Into telephone)

...under?

GINGER

(Over telephone)

Pretty serious.

ACE

(Over telephone)

How serious?

GINGER

It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.

ACE

(Over telephone)

It's under...

ACE

(Into telephone)

...twenty-five thousand?

GINGER

(Over telephone)

Yeah.

ACE

(Into telephone)

And...

ACE

(Over telephone)

...the rest of the two million is

still there?

GINGER

(Into telephone)

Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah.

He got his twenty-five.

(Sighs.)

That I'll live with. Any more I

couldn't.

GINGER

(Into telephone)

Okay?

ACE

(Over telephone)

All right...

ACE

(Into telephone)

...all right. Where are you? I'll

send a plane for you right away.

GINGER

(Waving brightly)

Hi, Sam.

ACE

So, what'd ya do with it?

GINGER

With what?

ACE

With the money.

GINGER

He needed some clothes.

ACE

(Sighs)

Twenty-five thousand for clothes.

GINGER

He wanted a watch, too.

ACE

Twenty-five thousand for clothes and

a watch.

GINGER

Mm-hm.

ACE

Mm-hm.

MAITRE D' (O.S.)

(From following scene)

Mr. R...

MAITRE D'

...good evening. Signora.

GINGER

Gino.

MAITRE D'

This way.

ACE (V.O.)

(as they are led to

their table)

The good part was, I had Amy back.

So, we went home, had the housekeeper

stay over, put the kid to bed, I

calmed myself down and we went to

dinner. I tried to keep things nice

and civil, you know.  But... hey,

twenty-five thousand for three suits?

That doesn't make much sense.

ACE

(Seated across from

GINGER at a booth)

First of all, he's not gonna wear f-

thousand-dollar suits. But let's say

he did, which he won't. How you gonna

get fitted for twenty-five suits in

three days?  I, um, I mean, how could

you get fitted that fast? I can't

get fitted that fast, and I pay twice

as much.

GINGER

I bought him a watch too.

ACE

Yeah.

GINGER

Yeah.

ACE

But even if you bought him a watch,

a really nice watch, one that he

thought was nice - and he doesn't

know what the fuck a good watch is -

so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?

GINGER

Yeah.

ACE

At the most, which is impossible for

him.

ACE

Plus, at the most, three suits, a

thousand apiece. That still leaves

what?  Around ten thousand?

GINGER

(Staring down at her

plate, trying to

restrain herself)

Would you knock it off, Sam?

ACE

I'm just tryin' to figure it out.

GINGER

There's nothin' to figure out. I'm

home... we're workin' it out.

ACE

Yeah, but I've been told that before,

'We're workin' it out.' You think

that you're home... after what you

just put me through with Amy, is a

favor to me?

ACE

(Pause)

So, counting the watch, let's say

another four thousand for expenses

over the weekend... of which you

must have had a good time. I know he

did.  That's for sure. I know that...

fuckin' piece of shit had a good

fuckin' time. On my money. You might

as well have fucked him, which you

probably did anyway.

ACE

You're lookin' at me a certain way.

You - you're teary-eyed, huh? You're

upset. You're a good actress, you

know that?  Good fuckin' actress.

You can fuckin' get that pity out of

people. I'm not a john, you

understand?  You always thought I

was, but I'm not. And I'm not a

sucker. That fuckin' pimp cocksucker.

He's lucky I didn't kill him last

time. Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.

And if you would've stayed with Amy...

and you would've ran away... you

would've been fuckin' dead.

ACE

Both of you. Dead. Dead.

GINGER (O.S.)

(Whispering into

telephone)

I cannot do it anymore. I can't

fuckin' live like this. It's not

right.

GINGER (O.S.)

What are you? Yes, of course - He

doesn't come home at night.  What is

the big fuckin' deal? I go - Yes,

and I just - I can't fuckin' take

it. Why should I fucking take it?

That wasn't the deal. He acts like...

like I'm the only one around here

with a fuckin' past. He'll never let

me live it down.  Well... well, I

mean, I tried. What the fuck do you

think I came back here for? No, I'm

not!

GINGER

(Whispering into

telephone)

I want to have him killed. Yes, I

want him killed.  I've fuckin' had

it.

GINGER

(Into telephone)

So, are you with me on this?

ACE

You want to get rid of me? Here I

am. Go ahead, get rid of me

(ACE grabs the phone.)

Hello.

GINGER

(Grunting)

Yes! I fuckin' hate you! I can't

take it anymore!

GINGER

Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your

fuckin' guts!

ACE

You hate my guts? I want you to come

with me now.

GINGER

Get off of me! Stop it!

ACE

Come with me now! Come with me now.

Come with me now. I want you out of

here.

ACE

I want you out of here! I want you

out of here!

GINGER

(Starting to get up)

Let go of me! Let go of me!

ACE

Take your

(kicking the bag)

fuckin' bag and get out of here!

GINGER

I'll go, but I want my money right

now!

ACE

You'll get your money! Don't worry.

GINGER

The arrangement is over!

ACE

(Tossing clothes)

No kidding. NO KIDDING!

GINGER

And I still get my money. I need

some cash right now. You can't just

put me in the street.

ACE

I'll get your cash. You haven't been

straight with me ever since I met

you! You never loved me in the first

place!  I need eyes in the back of

my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin'

bitch!

GINGER

Love you?!

GINGER

How could I love you?! How can I

love you?! You treat me like I'm

your fucking dog!

ACE

You're lower than a dog!

GINGER

Fuck you!

ACE

(Shoving the bundles

of cash in her face)

Here. Here. Is this enough money?!

Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin'

days? Take it, greedy bitch.

(Stuffing the money

in her bag.)

Take the fuckin' money you fuckin'

want.

GINGER

I'm going to the bank and I'm getting

my jewelry too!

ACE

Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at

9 a.m. Be there!

GINGER

And don't send your guys down there

to stop me! I mean it.

ACE

I guarantee you, I will not stop

you.

GINGER

Stop! You aren't getting rid of me

with one fuckin' suitcase!

ACE

You'll come back tomorrow and get

the rest. Just get out of here.

GINGER

Fine.

(Sniffs, walking back.)

I'm takin' Amy.

ACE

(Stopping her)

You're not takin' Amy.

GINGER

I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.

ACE

You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get

out of here.

GINGER

I am not! She's my daughter too!

Goddamn you!

ACE

Get out of here!

ACE

Send my lawyers a letter.

(Slamming the door

behind her.)

God-fuckin'-damn you!

GINGER (O.S.)

(Through the doors as

ACE walks away)

You're not getting away with this!

You're not gonna fuck me out of my

end!

GINGER

Fucker!

(Sobs.)

ACE (V.O.)

The funny thing was, that after all

that... I didn't want her to go. She

was the mother of my kid. I loved

her. And later... I realized I didn't

want to give her the money, because

if I did... I knew I'd never see her

again.

ACE

(Affectionately)

Oh. Have a good day at school.

AMY

Okay.

ACE

Okay? Okay, angel.

ACE

(Clears throat.)

From now on, I have to know where

you and Amy are at all times.

ACE

(Gently)

Now, here's a beeper. I want you to

keep it on you. It's very light.  So

I can call you whenever I have to.

ACE

(Pause.)

Okay?

NICKY (O.S.)

(From trailer)

Well, what are you supposed to do? I

mean, what do you want to do?  Do

you want to stay the way you are?

You want to stay like this?  You

can't do that.

NICKY

I mean, listen, two people don't get

along, at some point you gotta call

it... I mean, it's none of my

business, but I ... I think that's

what you gotta do. You gotta take it

somewhere -

GINGER

(Smoking a cigarette)

Oh, you're right, I know.  It's...

well, I was just -

NICKY

What? What?

GINGER

Nothin'.

NICKY

What were you gonna say? Go ahead.

GINGER

I don't -

(Sighs.)

NICKY

Tell me what you were gonna say. Go

ahead.

GINGER

Yeah?

NICKY

Yeah.

GINGER

Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you

know somebody at the bank...  could

help me get my jewelry out?  There's

a lot of money in there. Lot of money

in there, and I'd be willing to take

care of anybody who helped me out.

NICKY

(Pauses)

Let me think about that.

GINGER

Okay.

NICKY

See who I got in there. Gotta get

somebody I can trust.

GINGER

Mm-hm.

NICKY

You know?

GINGER

Yeah. 'Cause, you know,

(leaning her head

back)

He's never gonna give me my jewelry.

NICKY

Hm.

GINGER

He holds that key so tight, he's

probably got it stuck up his ass.

NICKY

(Chuckles)

Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's

probably got it there too.

GINGER

He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have

buried him. I could have gone to

Europe and taken the baby. And then

he'd've tracked me down and he'd've

killed me.

NICKY

No, he wouldn't. I would have.

(GINGER chuckles.)

And he'd've been right, too. I mean,

seriously.

(She cuddles closer

to him.)

Well, there's one thing you don't

do. You don't take a guy's kid and

then take off.

GINGER

(Quietly)

I didn't.

(Chuckles.)

I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I

did exactly what you told me to do,

and I came right back.

NICKY

You did. You're right.

GINGER

Exactly.

NICKY

You did. I like that. I like that.

That's what I like about you. You

did the right thing.

GINGER

(Playing with his

jacket)

I did what you told me to.

NICKY

Yes, you did.

GINGER

'Cause you always tell me the right

thing to do.

NICKY

Yeah.

(Pause, with his arm

around her.)

Boy, he really fucked himself up out

here -

(She caresses his

face.)

- didn't he?

GINGER

Sure did.

NICKY

Everything went to his head.

(He sighs, rubbing

her neck.)

NICKY/GINGER

(In unison)

Changed.

NICKY

He did. He ain't the same person,

right?

GINGER

(Whispering)

No, he's not.

NICKY

He really thinks who the fuck he is,

I'll tell you that.

GINGER

(Holding back tears)

Exactly.

(Sighs.)

He hates me.

GINGER

He hates my fuckin' guts.

NICKY

Come on, come on, you're a toughie.

You can take this.

(Runs his hand down

her cheek.)

Don't cry.

GINGER

(Crying)

I'm not as tough as you think I am.

NICKY

Yes, you are.

GINGER

(Sobbing)

I'm not and he scares the shit out

of me. I never know what he's gonna

do.

NICKY

(Whispering)

Come on. Don't be scared.

GINGER

(Softly, through tears)

I need some help. I do. I need some

help.

(Strokes his chest.)

You gotta help me. I need a new

sponsor, Nicky.

GINGER

(Whispering)

I do. I need a new sponsor.

NICKY

(Quietly, cheek to

cheek)

Is that what you want?

GINGER

Yeah.

NICKY

A sponsor.

GINGER

Yeah.

NICKY

Mm... okay. Don't worry about it.

Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore.

I'll take care of ya.

GINGER

(Whispering)

Nicky, please...

NICKY

Yes, I will. It's what you want,

isn't it? Huh?

GINGER

(Sobbing)

Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

NICKY

It's what you want?

GINGER

Yeah. Uh-huh -

FBI AGENT #1 (O.S.)

You see that?

FBI AGENT #1

That's Ace's wife.

FBI AGENT #1

Fantastic!

FBI AGENT #1

This is great for the boss.

GINGER

Hi.

ACE

Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.

GINGER

I threw it away.

ACE

You threw it away?

GINGER

(As she puts some

items away)

Look, I tried to do this thing. I

know that you want me to, but it's

just - You know, I'm driving down

the freeway and the fuckin' thing's

'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm

in a restaurant and it's - it's

embarrassing. I don't want to do it

anymore.

(Stopping suddenly.)

Where's Amy?

ACE

I put her to bed.

GINGER

Oh.

(Walking away towards

their bedroom.)

I got your cigarettes.

GINGER

Oscar wants you to call him.

ACE

So, who'd you go to lunch with?

GINGER

With Jennifer.

ACE

And where'd you go?

GINGER

To the Riviera.

ACE

(Pause)

What'd you have?

GINGER

I had a... salad.

ACE

What did Jennifer have?

GINGER

(Turning to ACE)

She had the same.

ACE

(Pause)

Okay. I want you to call Jennifer

and I want you to tell her to tell

you what she had for lunch, and I'm

gonna listen in on the other line.

GINGER

Why do you want to do that?

ACE

You know why I want to do it. Just

do it.

GINGER

Fine.

(Walking out and down

the hall.)

Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.

ACE

Mm.

GINGER

The line's busy. There's nobody there.

JENNIFER

(Over telephone)

Hello.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -

GINGER

All right... I didn't have lunch

with Jennifer.

ACE

(Hanging up)

Who were you with?

GINGER

(Quietly)

I was with somebody.

ACE

I know you were with somebody. Who

was it?

(Pause.)

I just hope it's not someone who I

think it might be.

(Sighs, then whispers:)

I just hope it's not them.

ACE (V.O.)

(Quietly)

I knew she fucked around.

(Sighing.)

You know...

ACE (V.O.)

...she did what she did and I did

what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky

was the worst thing she could've

done.

ACE

What if he won't stop?

ACE (V.O.)

I mean, it could get us both killed.

GINGER

I can back him off.

ACE (V.O.)

She was very convincing...

ACE (V.O.)

...when she wanted to be.

ACE (V.O.)

And... this... this is how she backed

him off.

NICKY

Hey, Ginger... don't forget, if you're

challenged, you know, if he asks

anything, deny everything.

(He walks up to her.)

Do you understand? I don't want him

bringin' beefs back home ... 'cause

that could be a problem. You gotta

be careful. He's not dumb, you know?

You hear what I'm sayin', right?

GINGER

I know. You don't have to tell me

that. What do you think,

(chuckling)

I'm stupid?

NICKY

Do I think you're stupid? No, I think

you're beautiful.

(He bends down and

kisses her.)

But I gotta go.

ACE (V.O.)

By this...

ACE (V.O.)

...time, Nicky had things so fucked

up on the streets, that every time

Marino went back home, the...

ACE (V.O.)

...packages got smaller and smaller.

It got...

ACE (V.O.)

...to the point when he walked into

the place... he didn't know whether

he was gonna be kissed or killed.

GAGGI (O.S.)

Frankie, I want to ask you something.

GAGGI

It's private... but I want you to

tell me the truth.

MARINO

Of course, Remo.

GAGGI

I want you to tell me the truth,

mind you.

MARINO

I always tell you the truth, Remo.

GAGGI

Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't

be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he?

Because if he is... it's a problem.

MARINO (V.O.)

What could I say? I knew if I gave

the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky,

Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've

would up gettin' killed.

MARINO (V.O.)

Because there's one thing about these

old timers: They don't like any

fuckin' around with the other guy's

wives. It's bad for business.

MARINO (V.O.)

So, I lied... even though I knew

that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind

up gettin' killed too.

MARINO

(To GAGGI)

No. I ain't see anything like that.

GAGGI

Are you sure?

MARINO

I'm positive.  Remo... things are

very fucked up down there, you know?

GAGGI

Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking.

You see, my main concern is Nicky.

MARINO

Hm.

GAGGI

I want to know... if he's doin' all

right. If he's okay.

MARINO

He's good. He's fine.

GAGGI

I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an

eye on Nicky. Do it for me.

MARINO

No problem.

GAGGI

You see... I wouldn't want to be

jeopardizing anything for people who

are our friends. You understand?

MARINO

I understand.

GAGGI

Okay.

(Pause.)

Frankie, you're a good boy.

MARINO

Thanks, Remo.

ACE (V.O.)

By now, Nicky and his crew had already

hit rock bottom. I mean, Vegas really

got to him.

ACE (V.O.)

The booze, the coke, the broads... I

mean, he got sloppy.  He just wasn't

the same Nicky anymore.

MARINO

(To NICKY)

You must have drunk too much.

NICKY

Go fuck yourself.

ACE (V.O.)

I heard one night he had to belt a

guy three times before he finally

went down.

ACE (V.O.)

In the old days, Nicky would've decked

him with one shot.

ACE (V.O.)

You add this into the mix...

ACE (V.O.)

...to all of us. And his crew followed

him right over the edge.

ACE (V.O.)

They were all tuned up half the time

on coke. I mean, they started doin'...

ACE (V.O.)

...stupid things.

COP #1

Watch it, partner, watch it!

ACE (V.O.)

The worst was Blue.

BLUE

(Belligerent)

Hey, what do you guys want out of my

life, huh?

COP #1

Police! Stay in the fuckin' car!

ACE (V.O.)

He never knew when to keep his fuckin'

mouth shut.

COP #2

He has a gun!

COP #1

Drop your gun or I'll -!

BLUE

Hey, fuck you!

COP #1

Drop the gun!

ACE (V.O.)

The cops shot him. They shot Blue...

ACE (V.O.)

...because they thought his hero

sandwich was a gun!

ACE (V.O.)

You know, they could have...

ACE (V.O.)

...been right, but who knows?

COP #1

Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a

fuckin' hero sandwich here.

COP #2

What do you want? It - It's pitch-

black out here. It's tin foil.

COP #1

Pitch-black?! It -

COP #2

It looked like a fuckin' gun!

COP #1

You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be

filling out paper work for the next

two months because of you and this

piece of shit, you...

COP #2

Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm

sorry.

COP #1

...fuckin' jerk-off.

ACE (V.O.)

And to make matters worse, to get

even, Nicky's crew got stoned one

night and they started shootin' up

the cops' houses.

ACE (V.O.)

I mean, it got to the point where

they couldn't even talk in the Gold

Rush anymore because the Feds put a

wire in the wall.

ACE (V.O.)

And even when they talked outside,

they had to cover their mouths

because...

LIP-READER

(Lowering his

binoculars)

Jeez, he's coverin' up again.

ACE (V.O.)

...the Feds brought in lip-readers.

ACE (V.O.)

Nicky found out about it from a teller

who owed him money.  This guy

worked...

MARINO

He asked me again about you and the

Jew's wife.

NICKY

Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

MARINO

He asked me again about you and the

Jew's wife.

NICKY

Yeah, what'd you tell him?

MARINO

I told him I didn't know nothin'.

But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said

if you did anything, you're fucked

up.

NICKY

You think he's goin' home, makin' a

beef behind my back?

MARINO

Nah. You would've heard somethin'.

NICKY

Yeah, what's to stop him?

MARINO

I know. I know.

NICKY

I don't trust him anymore. But they'd

never okay anything, you know?

MARINO

Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.

NICKY

Well, now, sure they're askin'. They

earn with the prick. I got a funny

feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin'

war or somethin'.

(Pause)

I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w-

You know, but you know what I want

you to do?

MARINO

What?

NICKY

Who's this guy? Who's this guy?

MARINO

Oh, he ain't nobody.

NICKY

You know what I want you to do? Get

a couple of guys to dig a hole in

the desert, then let 'em show you

where it's at.

MARINO

Angelo and Buster.

NICKY

Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.

MARINO

They'll do it.

NICKY

And when I'm ready, I'll say the

words, 'Go see the Jew.'

MARINO

Yeah.

NICKY

And you make it disappear, you know

what I mean?

MARINO

Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta

be ready. You know what I'm talkin'

about?

NICKY

Did I say to do anything yet? I said

I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I

want to think about it. Where're

these pricks at?

MARINO

Don't know.

NICKY

Dominick said they're in the motel?

MARINO

Yeah, either that or in the fuckin'

bank. I don't know. They're all over

the joint.

ACE

(Getting up from the

table)

Be right back. I'll be right back.

ACE

Rudy, any calls for me, just give

'em to Mr Sherbert. I'll be right

back.

RUDY

Sure, Mr Rothstein. You'll be back...?

ACE

I'm going home for a few seconds.

I'll be right back.

RUDY

(Into telephone)

He's on his way home.

RUDY

(Over telephone)

Yeah, he just left.

NICKY

Yeah? All right.

ACE

(Looking around the

house)

Hello? Hello! Ginger.

AMY

(Faintly, from her

bedroom)

Help, Daddy!

ACE

(Knocking, turning

the doorknob)

Amy! Amy, open the door!

AMY (O.S.)

(From her room)

I can't! I'm tied!

ACE

Wh-wh -

AMY

Dad!

ACE

What happened? What happened? Who

did this to you?

AMY

Mommy.

ACE

I'm gonna get a knife and cut you

loose, honey, I'll -

AMY

(Panting)

Oh, no, please, please.

ACE

(Bending down, kisses

her)

Okay, I'll be right back.

ACE

When did this happen, honey?

AMY

I don't know.

ACE

You don't know? What time did your

mother do this? When did she leave?

AMY

I don't know.

ACE

(Comforting AMY as

she moans)

Ohhh...

ACE

(Into telephone)

Hello.

NICKY

(Over telephone)

Sammy.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Yeah, uh, who's this?

NICKY

It's me.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Nick?

NICKY

(Into telephone)

Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?

ACE

(Over telephone)

No, I'm not okay.

ACE

(Into telephone)

How'd you know I was here?

NICKY

(Over telephone)

Well...

NICKY

(Into telephone)

...uh, you know, I just wanted to

talk to you a minute.

ACE

(Over telephone)

Well...

ACE

(Into telephone)

...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy

up and she locked her in her room. I

gotta find her. I don't know where

the hell she is.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over

here at the Leaning Tower with me.

ACE

(Into telephone)

She's there with you?

(Getting angry.)

She's there with you?

NICKY

(Over telephone)

Yeah, she's here.

ACE

(Into telephone)

I'll be right there.

NICKY

(Into telephone)

Uh, all right.

NICKY

He's comin' over.

DOMINICK

Great!

NICKY

(Trying to calm him)

Ace don't... listen, don't... don't

make a scene, all right?

ACE

I want to just talk. I want to talk

to that Irish bitch.

NICKY

She didn't know who to turn to.

(Raising his hand

almost in a plea.)

She... she didn't know where to turn.

She was tryin' to save your marriage.

ACE

Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that

fuckin' bitch.

NICKY

(Menacing)

Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice.

Don't fuck up in here.

GINGER

(Stoned, smoking a

cigarette)

Hi, Sam.

ACE

(Quietly)

I mean, you tie up our kid and you

lock the fuckin' door?  Are...

GINGER

Oh...

ACE

...you out of your mind? That's our

child. Are you out of your fuckin'

mind?

GINGER

It's just for a little while, Sam.

The baby-sitter wasn't there.

ACE

I ought to fuckin' have you committed.

You fuckin' do that again,

(pointing his finger

at her)

I'll f-, I'll f-

GINGER

She wasn't gonna get up. I was just

gonna be out for a little while.

ACE

I should have -

GINGER

I mean, she was asleep. I was going

to be right back before she even

woke up.

ACE

Listen to me, listen to me, listen

to me.

(Pounding his fist on

the table.)

Listen, you fuckin' cunt.

GINGER

Oh, sh-

ACE

Listen to me.

GINGER

Fuck you.

ACE

(Knocking her drink

over)

Let me tell you something.

(Pointing.)

Listen to me.

GINGER

I w- I was gonna be back before she

woke up.

ACE

You listen carefully! You ever fuckin'

touch her again, you ever do anything

like that again, I'll fuckin' kill

you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear

me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll

fuckin' kill you, you bitch.

GINGER

(Leaning in to him)

Why don't you just let me go, Sam?

ACE

You fuckin' whore!

GINGER

I'll sign anything you want me to

sign, okay?

ACE

You understand? What? Let you go?

GINGER

I just want the key to my jewelry,

and I want you to let me go.

ACE

You want your jewelry?

GINGER

I want you to let me go.

ACE

And what? And let you disgrace me,

you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace

me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother.

Get in the car and go to the house...

ACE

Right now. Get up and -

ACE

Get - Get up! Get up!

GINGER

I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were

you.

ACE

Get - get up!

GINGER

I wouldn't do that...

ACE

Get up! Get going!

(Pushing the table.)

Get up!

GINGER

I wouldn't -

ACE

Get the fu-

(Shaking the table.)

You threatening me?

(Making a fist.)

I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!

(Pointing to her.)

Get up and go home right now.

GINGER

(Barking)

I'm going. I'm going, you -!

ACE

Now you need approval from him to go

home?

GINGER

So what? So who fuckin' blew you in

the parking lot before you came in...

huh?

ACE

(Disgusted)

You make me sick, you fuck. Once a

fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.

GINGER

Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!

(Opening the door.)

Fuck you!

ACE

(Into telephone)

Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put

him on.

SHERBERT

(Over telephone)

Who's this?

ACE

(Into telephone)

Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to

you later. Just - You - You got a

gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over

here right away.

SHERBERT

(Into telephone)

Okay. Just take it easy.

ACE

(Over telephone)

Right away. Okay?

SHERBERT

(Into telephone)

I-I'll do it.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Okay.

(He hangs up.)

GINGER

(To VALET PARKER)

Leave it where it is.

GINGER

Where is he? Goddamn it! I want that

Jew bastard killed! I have fuckin'

had it!

MARINO

Calm down, calm down. Shh!

NICKY

Shh.

(To MARINO.)

Hide her car in the back!

GINGER

There's no reason to hide my car. He

already knows!

(Walking up the stairs.)

He threw it in my face! The second I

get out of here, I -

NICKY

What did I tell you? Supposing he

goes back home and makes a fuckin'

beef?  I gotta know exactly what you

said. Tell me what you said to him.

GINGER

Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I

said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he

said, I just kept sayin' no.

NICKY

I told you this was fuckin' dangerous.

Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a

dangerous situation. Be very careful.'

You fuckin' yessed me to death.

GINGER

If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then

why don't you kill him?

NICKY

I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the

fuck up. What, do you know what you're

talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-

GINGER

(Interrupting)

Oh, well, then, have him killed and

get it over with.

NICKY

(Loud and angry)

Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass,

will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin'

guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna

fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck...

motherfucker! I knew this, I knew

it.

GINGER

What about my money?

NICKY

(Raising his voice

even more)

How the fuck am I gonna get your

fuckin' money now? You think he's

gonna give you fuckin' money? Are

you out of your mind?!  Look what

you just did to this fuckin' guy!

If you would have just kept your

fuckin' mouth shut!

(Walking away.)

Ah, what the fuck is the use? I

should've never got invol-

NICKY

(Grappling with her)

What? Hey! Hey! What the fuck are

you... ?

GINGER

Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin'

asshole!

NICKY

Get the fuck out of here. Get out!

Get the fuck out!

MARINO (O.S.)

(From bottom of stairway)

Whoa. Calm down.

NICKY

(Behind GINGER)

Get out. Get out! Get out!

MARINO (O.S.)

Take it easy!

NICKY

Why'd I get involved with this fuckin'

nut in the first place? Get out!

MARINO

You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take

it easy.

NICKY

(Pushing a sobbing

GINGER out the back

door)

Get her the fuck out of here. Get

her out of here.

NICKY

Get the fuck out of here.

GINGER

(Sobbing, getting up)

I don't need you! I have my own

fuckin' money!

NICKY

All right, all right.

GINGER

I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared

anymore!

NICKY

All right. Be careful.

GINGER

You fucked with me for the last time!

NICKY

Okay, yeah.

NICKY

Be careful.

(To MARINO.)

Hey, come on. Get inside.

NICKY

Can you fuckin' believe that?

(Showing MARINO his

scratches.)

Look at this motherfucker.

NICKY

I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up

good this time. Should have never

started with this fuckin' broad.

MARINO

Take it easy. What could you do? I

mean, she threw herself at you, right?

NICKY

I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You

know that? Bad fuckin' spot.

ACE (V.O.)

I already left the kid with neighbors

and I had about a million in cash

and jewels that I gave to Sherbert

to lock up in the hotel.

ACE (O.S.)

(From following scene)

Put this in the...

ACE

...hotel safe, then I want you to

come right back.

ACE

She, she's alone. Just go. Take the

gun and go into Amy's.

GINGER (O.S.)

(Screaming)

You get down here!

ACE

(To SHERBERT as he

walks around the bar

with the gun)

Just wait there for me!

GINGER

(From driveway)

Get down here and talk to me, goddamn

it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You

motherfucker!

GINGER

(From her car)

I mean it!

GINGER

You come down here right now! Come

down here and talk to me, goddamn

it! Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out

here!  I'm gonna drive this fucking

car through the living-room!

GINGER

(Getting out of the

car to confront ACE)

You fucking coward! You motherfucker!

GINGER

You come out here and talk to me,

you fucker!

ACE

(From the porch)

Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're

on drugs. You're gonna -

GINGER

I am not!

ACE

(Pointing to her)

You're gonna be sorry if you don't

stop that.

GINGER

Don't you threaten me!

ACE

You'll wake the whole neighborhood!

GINGER

(Kicking the hedges)

Don't you threaten me!

GINGER (O.S.)

You are not threatening me anymore!

ACE (O.S.)

I'm not -

GINGER

You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you!

GINGER

I am fuckin' Nicky Santoro! I am!

He's my new sponsor!

GINGER

(To ACE)

What about that, you fuckhead?!

(To neighbors.)

What are you looking at? Fuck off!

COP #1

Hey!

COP #2

Hey!

GINGER

(To neighbors)

Go back inside! This is none of your

business!

(To ACE.)

I don't have to take your shit all

the time anymore.

COP #1

Hey.

GINGER

I'll to the FBI!

COP #2

Mrs. Rothstein, hey.

GINGER

I will go to the police! I am not

(kicking hedge)

Protecting you anymore, you fuck!

COP #1

Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!

GINGER

He won't...

GINGER (O.S.)

...let me inside!

GINGER (O.S.)

He won't let me in my own house!

COP #1

Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry.

We've got some complaints about -

about the noise.

GINGER

I'm just trying to get in my house!

COP #1

I understand.

GINGER

He won't let me go in my house!

ACE

I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy,

I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well,

I'm not gonna let her in, the way

she's behaving. I'm - I'm -

GINGER

Not gonna let me in?

ACE

Who knows what you're gonna do in

there? I don't want you -

GINGER

What do you mean, what am I gonna

do? I'm in the same clothes for two

days! I want to get a few of my

things! Big deal!

COP #1

All right. Okay, okay.

COP #2

Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let

her in the house and get a few of

her things?  That way she'll get out

of here. This is half her house

anyway.

ACE

I'm afraid to let her in the house.

GINGER

Oh, you are...

ACE

I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.

GINGER

(Kicking, pulling up

plants and throwing

them at ACE)

Let me in the house! Fucker!

GINGER

Fucker!

COP #1

Please.

ACE

Should I let her in like - ?

GINGER

You ought to be afraid, the way you

fuckin' treat me!

COP #1

Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a

lot easier on everybody here if we

just let her in the house.

COP #2

If we let her get a few of her things

we'll be out of your hair.

ACE

If she calms down, I will let her in

the house.

GINGER

(Pants, yelling)

I am calm!

ACE

If she calms down...

COP #1

(To GINGER)

No, you're not calm.

ACE

...I will let her in the house for

five minutes if you gentlemen will

escort her out if she happens not to

want to leave. Because I don't - I -

GINGER

(To COP #1)

Can I go in?

COP #1

That's not a problem, that's not a p-

GINGER

Can I go in?

COP #1

Jeff, would you go in with her?

COP #2

We can do that. Absolutely. Yes.

Absolutely.

GINGER

Yes, fine!  Fine!

(In ACE's face as she

brushes past him.)

Fuck you!

GINGER (O.S.)

(From following scene)

You wouldn't believe how mean he's

been to me. He's locked up...

GINGER

...most of my important stuff, all

my papers and things. And I have to

get 'em.

GINGER

So don't let him come in here 'cause

I know they're in here in the desk

and he's -

GINGER

Fuck!

(Going through a couple

of drawers.)

Just pay attention. He could come up

here at any time.

(Pants.)

GINGER

(Then, to COP #2)

Are you watching for him?

GINGER

Got 'em.

ACE

(Smoking, checking

his watch)

Yeah, I don't want her in there more

than a few more minutes.

COP #1

No, it's - it'll just be a couple of

minutes. We got other things to do

too, you know. He'll hurry her up.

How's everything else besides this?

ACE

Fine, fine. How's your family?

COP #1

Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my

wife's pregnant again.

ACE

Oh, good.

COP #1

Yeah.

ACE

Congratulations.

COP #1

Thanks, yeah... I'm kind of happy

about this, you know.

GINGER

(Kneeling, to COP #2)

I just have to get this one more

thing and then we'll be - We can go.

(She picks up an empty

shoe box.)

Shit!

(Gets up, picking up

a pair of ACE's shoes

and tossing them on

the floor.)

God, fuck! Shit! God!

(She runs out, taking

a fur coat off a

hangar. Then, grunting)

Really pisses me off...

(To COP #2.)

Don't worry about it.

GINGER

(To the COPS but

looking at ACE)

And it would be great if you guys

could follow me out of here, because

he's been threatening me.

COP #2

(To COP #1)

Come on. I'm sorry.

COP #1

Okay.

ACE

(to COP #1, shaking

hands)

Okay, Randy. Thank you.

COP #1

All right, take care.

GINGER

(To herself, panting)

I can't believe this.

(Sighs.)

GINGER

(To COPS, rushing

inside)

I just need to pick up a little cash

inside.  Could you come with me?

ACE

(Into telephone,

throwing the scissors

into the open drawer)

Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta

stop her!

CHARLIE CLARK

(Over telephone)

I-I'm sorry, Sam.

ACE

(Into telephone)

You've got to stop her.

CHARLIE CLARK

(Over telephone)

What can I do?

ACE

(Into telephone)

She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of

her fucking mind.  Do you unders-

CHARLIE CLARK

(Over telephone)

She has...

CHARLIE CLARK

(Into telephone)

...the keys, and it's still in both

your names.

GINGER

(Carrying the box,

slipping but catching

herself)

Whoa.

CHARLIE CLARK

(Into telephone)

I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

I'd like to help...

CHARLIE CLARK

(Over telephone)

...but I can't.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Legally, she can't take that stuff.

Legally, she can't take the stuff.

CHARLIE CLARK

(Over telephone)

No, Ace.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Half of everything is mine.

CHARLIE CLARK

(Over telephone)

Ace, listen to me.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Half - I'm comin' down.

(He hangs up.)

GINGER

Shit! Oh, goddamn it!

GINGER

(Then, to COPS who

are watching)

Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you

could just ask the guy for a big

bag, okay?

COP #1

(To COP #2)

Go get a bag, man.

GINGER

(Looking up, offering

COP #1 some cash)

And here. Here.

COP #1

Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-

GINGER

No, you can, you can.

(Sobbing.)

You've been so nice to me.

COP #1

(Taking the money)

I can't.

COP #2

(To GINGER)

Like this?

GINGER

(Struggling with two

handfuls of cash)

Yeah, just hold the top open, all

right, and I can -

GINGER

Oh, God. It's him.

(To COPS.)

You have to stop him. You have to -

'Cause he said he was going to kill

me.

GINGER

You just - Just stop him.

COP #1

Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where

you goin' -

ACE

Stop -

COP #1

Wait, hold on a second.

ACE

Hey!

COP #1

Hold on a second.

COP #1

Nothin' we can do about it. Nothin'

we can do. There's nothin' we can

do.

ACE

Look, look. You can't stop her for

speeding? I mean, look what the hell

she's doing.

COP #1

Speeding?

COP #2

We're talkin' to you right now.

COP #2

There's nothing we can do. She had

the key.

COP #1

She's on the account. There's nothing

we can do.

FBI AGENT #1

Let's pull her over at that Citgo

Station.

FBI AGENT #2

(Driving)

Okay, let's do it.

FBI AGENT #2

We're - we're placing you under arrest

for -

GINGER

(Sobbing)

For what?

FBI AGENT #2

We're placing you under arrest for

aiding and abetting -

GINGER

(Through tears)

What?

FBI AGENT #2

We're placing you under arrest for

aiding and abetting a -

GINGER

(Crying)

But I'm just trying to leave.

ACE (V.O.)

After all the threats and all the

bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't

tell 'em anything. But by then, the

Feds didn't need her, anyway.

GINGER

(Sobbing)

But it was just mine.

ACE (V.O.)

They had all the pieces they needed.

FBI AGENT #1

Come on.

GINGER

But I didn't do anything.

ACE (V.O.)

And everybody...

ACE (V.O.)

...began to tumble.

FBI AGENT #3

FBI! We have a warrant!

ACE (V.O.)

...one after the other... just like

dominoes. Between Piscano complaining

on a wire.

ACE (V.O.)

Between Nicky, Ginger, me and my

license... paradise... we managed to

really fuck it all up.

LITTLE NICKY

(Getting up from the

couch)

Mom!

JENNIFER (O.S.)

(Into telephone)

Yeah, well, someone's at the fuckin'

door now.

FBI AGENT #4

FBI. We have a federal search warrant.

NICKY (V.O.)

Right away, I got wind of the pinches

comin' down, so I took off. Who needs

to hang around for that bullshit?

FBI AGENT #4

(To JENNIFER, showing

his badge)

My name is Marc Caspar, Special Agent,

FBI.

JENNIFER

(Defensive)

Yeah, well,

(grabbing the phone

and walking away)

Can I make a fuckin' phone call?

FBI AGENT #4

(Blocking her way as

she tries to get by

him)

Hey, ho-hold it for a minute. You

can make a phone call, but you don't

have to talk to us like that.

JENNIFER

(Slamming the phone

down on a table)

Hey -

FBI AGENT #5

FBI! Don't be alarmed.

NICKY (V.O.)

But they got almost everybody else.

FBI AGENT #5

This area is seized.

DUPREY

Grab everything in sight.

FBI AGENT #6

Right.

DUPREY

(Walking through a

door into the cage)

Get the master account list!

AUSTIN

I want all those papers seized,

regardless of what they are.

AUSTIN

I want this area off-limits to

everybody.

AUSTIN

(Holding the book)

Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps

figures.  [Actual amount taken from

craps tables before the skim.] Hey -

Hey.

ACE (V.O.)

Green?

ACE (V.O.)

Don't even ask.

FBI AGENT #8

Thirty thousand dollars...

GREEN

No, he didn't. And that's why it

wasn't valid. I was being extorted,

all right?  I'm willing to tell you

whatever you want to know. I've got

nothin' to hide here.

NICKY (V.O.)

Now, for the best...

NICKY (V.O.)

...and I couldn't believe this shit.

Piscano's expense reports took the

cake.

FBI AGENT #9

Oh, this is good. Bingo!

NICKY (V.O.)

He might as well have given them a

fuckin' blueprint.  Everybody's names,

address, dates, everything.

FBI AGENT #9

(Crossing the room to

PISCANO)

Look at this! That you so much, Mr

Piscano. How considerate of you.

Appreciate it.

PISCANO

Those are my m- those are my mother's

books.

FBI AGENT #10

You're under arrest.

NICKY (V.O.)

What a fuckin' balloon head.

PISCANO

What are you guys doin'?!

FBI AGENT #10

Take it easy, Artie. We just want to

talk to you.

PISCANO'S WIFE

(Screaming)

Artie, are you okay? Sweetheart?

Honey? Wait a minute! He's sick!

Artie! Oh, God!

FBI AGENT #10

(To PISCANO's wife)

Move back! Come on!

FBI AGENT #9

Dave!

PISCANO'S WIFE

He's sick! It's his heart!

FBI AGENT #9

CPR! Now!

PISCANO'S WIFE

Oh, God, is he breathing? He's not

breathing!

ACE (V.O.)

Poor Artie. He got so upset he had a

heart attack and dropped dead right

there in front of his wife.

PISCANO'S WIFE

Artie!

FBI AGENT #10

Calm down! Calm down!

PISCANO'S WIFE

No, I won't calm down! He's my

husband!

FBI AGENT #10

Stay out of the way!

PISCANO'S WIFE

Artie! Artie!

FBI AGENT #10

We can't help him if -

ACE (V.O.)

(Quietly)

And at the end of the day, they

finally came to see me with the

pictures.

FBI AGENT #1

(Pointing to the

pictures)

Why protect a friend who betrayed

you like that?

ACE (V.O.)

But I didn't want to look at 'em. I

didn't want to look at the guys who

brought 'em either.

LAWYER

Your Honor, as you can see, my clients

are elderly and infirm. Any

incarceration could pose a serious

health risk. They are no danger to

the community and they pose no flight

risk.

NICKY (V.O.)

When the bosses were arrested, some

of 'em were so old they needed doctors

at their arraignment.

LAWYER

And Pre-trial Services recommends

that bail remain as presently set.

JUDGE

(Calling a recess)

We're going to take a ten-minute

recess.

NICKY (V.O.)

And when it looked like they could

get twenty-five years...

NICKY (V.O.)

...to life in prison, just for

skimmin' a casino... sick or no

fuckin' sick, you knew people were

gonna get clipped. So, the day of

the arraignment, they had this meeting

right in the back of the court-house.

NICKY (V.O.)

See, when something like this happens,

you know how things are gonna work

out. It's always better with no

witnesses. So, what about Andy?

FORLANO

(Putting down his

oxygen mask once the

door behind him is

shut)

He won't talk. Stone is a good kid.

Stand-up guy, just like his old man.

That's the way I see it.

BORELLI

I agree. He's solid. A fuckin' Marine.

CAPELLI

(Holding his oxygen

mask)

He's okay. He always was. Remo, what

do you think?

GAGGI

(Pause)

Look... why take a chance? At least,

that's the way I feel about it.

STONE

You call Artie... and you tell him I

don't care what, he's gotta be in my

office Thursday morning before eleven

o'clock.

LAWYER

It's done.

LAWYER (O.S.)

It's done.

STONE

(To himself)

It's terribly important. I gotta

have a conversation with this guy.

That's all.

NICKY (V.O.)

As much as they liked him, I mean,

he wasn't one of us. He wasn't

Italian. As far as they knew, he

could have talked. Otherwise, Stony

might still be alive.

NICKY (V.O.)

The first one to skip was John Nance.

He found a nice, warm secluded place

in Costa Rica. He thought nobody

would find him there.

NICKY (V.O.)

But, then, his kid got nabbed by the

Feds for drugs, and so naturally the

bosses were afraid he'd come out of

hidin' just to save his kid and give

'em all up.  So...

CURLY

Hey, where you goin', jag-off?

NICKY (V.O.)

But anyway, they, you know, they all

had to follow.

NICKY (V.O.)

Everybody went down.

COUNT ROOM EXEC

Go ahead, fuck...

CURLY

Fuck you.

NICKY (V.O.)

Before you knew it...

NICKY (V.O.)

...anybody who knew anything wound

up gettin' whacked.

GINGER (O.S.)

(Gasping)

Oh! Oh, no!  No...

ACE (V.O.)

After Ginger took off, she wasn't

much help to anybody. She found some

pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers

in LA. And in a few months, they

went through all the money and all

the jewels.

ACE (V.O.)

After they found her body... I had a

private doctor do another autopsy.

He said they gave her... a hot dose.

In the end... all she had left was

thirty-six hundred in mint-condition

coins.

ACE (V.O.)

No matter what the Feds or the papers

might have said about my car

bombing...

ACE (V.O.)

...it was amateur night, and you

could tell. Whoever it was, they put

the dynamite under the passenger

side. But what they didn't know,

what nobody outside the factory knew,

was that that model car was made

with a metal plate under the driver's

seat. It's the only thing that saved

my life.

ACE (V.O.)

The bombing was never authorized,

but I suspect I know who lit the

fuse.

FAT SALLY (O.S.)

Hey, Nicky.

ACE (V.O.)

And so did the power that be.

NICKY

Hey, Mikey, how's your hernia?

FAT SALLY

How you doin'?

NICKY (V.O.)

It took months for...

NICKY: (V.O.)

...everything to calm down, but

finally my guys got out on bail and

the bosses wanted me to send my

brother Dominick out to Vegas.  Always

the dollars, always the fuckin'...

NICKY (V.O.)

...dollars. I mean, it was still way

too hot for me to even go near Vegas,

so I set up a meeting with the guys

way out in the sticks. I didn't want

my brother to get fucked around.

NICKY (V.O.)

I mean, what's right is right. They

don't give a fuck about - urgghh!

FAT SALLY

Huh? Come on, you fuckin' rat.

DOMINICK

Fuck!  You...

DOMINICK

(To MARINO)

...rat motherfucker! You rat mother-

MARINO

Tough guy! You and your f-

(he strikes DOMINICK's

chest)

Fuckin' brother!

DOMINICK

Oh, you - !

MARINO

No more!

FAT SALLY

Get him, Marino!

MARINO

(Hitting DOMINICK

across the neck)

You fuckin' scumbag!

MARINO

(Lunging the bat into

DOMINICK's stomach)

No more.

NICKY

(Still pinned,

screaming)

Frankie!

MARINO

(Looking at NICKY as

he strikes DOMINICK)

No more! You see? Watch!

NICKY

(Held down by his

neck)

Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!

MARINO

Fuck you, you motherfuck!

NICKY

Fuckin' punk, motherfucker! Piece of

shit!

MARINO

No more fuckin' dirty work!

NICKY

(Rolling over on his

back in pain)

No, no, no, no!

MARINO

(To HARDY and BEEPER)

Take him out! Take this motherfucker

out!

NICKY

(Whimpering, as they

beat DOMINICK)

Dominick! Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.

Frankie.

(Pleading for his

brother's life.)

Frankie, leave the kid alone. He's

still breathin'. He's still breathin'.

Leave him alone. Frankie.

MARINO

All right. Strip him.

NICKY

(Sobbing as they

undress his brother)

No balls, you got no fuckin' balls.

Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.

NICKY

(Crying quietly)

Dominick.  Dominick.

(Sobs.)

Dominick.

MARINO

Come on, come on. Bury 'em.

ACE (V.O.)

The word was out. The bosses had had

enough of Nicky. They had enough.

How much were they gonna take? So,

they made an example of him and his

brother. They buried them while they

were still breathing.

MAN #1

Mister, you all right?

MAN #2

Watch out, the -!

MAN #2

Mister, you all right?

ACE

(Dazed)

Yeah.

ACE (V.O.)

They had other ideas for me.

AMBULANCE DRIVER

(As ACE is wheeled

into the rear of the

ambulance)

You sure are lucky, mister.

ACE (V.O.)

The town will never be the same.

After the...

ACE (V.O.)

...Tangiers, the big corporations

took it all over. Today it looks

like...

ACE (V.O.)

...Disneyland.

ACE (V.O.)

And while the kids play cardboard

pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the

house payments and Junior's college

money...

ACE (V.O.)

...on the poker slots.

ACE (V.O.)

In the old days, dealers knew your

name, what you drank, what you played.

Today, it's like checkin' into an

airport. And if you order room

service, you're lucky if you get it

by Thursday.

ACE (V.O.)

Today, it's all gone. You get a whale

show up with four million in a...

ACE (V.O.)

...suitcase, and some twenty-five-

year-old hotel school kid is gonna

want his Social Security Number.

ACE (V.O.)

After the Teamsters got...

ACE (V.O.)

...knocked out of the box, the

corporations tore down practically

every one of the old casinos. And

where did the money come from...

ACE (V.O.)

...to rebuild the pyramids?... Junk

bonds.

ACE

(Into telephone)

Still not sure?

RACE ANNOUNCER

(From a television

set)

They're off and running...

ACE

(Into telephone)

Probable, but may be questionable.

All right. Well, let me know as soon

as you can find out.

ACE (V.O.)

But in the end, I wound up right

back where I started. I could still

pick winners, and I could still make

money for all kinds of people back

home. And why mess up a good thing?

And that's that.
