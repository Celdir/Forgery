GRIFTERS - by Donald E. Westlake

GRIFTERS

by Donald E. Westlake

Based on the novel by Jim Thompson.

Second Draft.

March 1989

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

CALLER (O.S.)

And they're off!

JEWELER

Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.

MYRA

Why? What's wrong?

JEWELER

(personal emotion mixed

in)

You are a valued customer, as you

know.

MYRA

But what's wrong?

JEWELER

I can't understand a thing like

this. It's something you almost

never see.

MYRA

What is?

JEWELER

(holding up bracelet)

This is some of the finest

filigreed platinum I've ever seen.

But the stones, no. They're not

diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.

MYRA

But they must be! They cut glass!

JEWELER

(wry)

Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.

Do you know where it was purchased?

MYRA

It was a gift. It isn't worth

anything at all?

JEWELER

(warm, encouraging)

Why, of course it is. I can offer

you -- well, five hundred dollars.

MYRA

All right.

JEWELER

(rising)

I'll get you a check.

JEWELER

I hope you're not too badly

disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.

MYRA

It's not your fault.

JEWELER

You'll give us an opportunity to

serve you again, I hope. If there's

anything you think we might be

interested in...

MYRA

I have only one thing now. Are you

interested?

JEWELER

Well, I'd have to see it, of

course.

MYRA

You are seeing it. You're looking

right at it.

JEWELER

I see.

JEWELER

You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A

bracelet like that very rarely

happens. A fine setting and

workmanship usually mean precious

stones. It always hurts me when I

find they're not. I always hope --

(faint sad friendly smile)

-- I'm mistaken.

MYRA

Thank you. For everything you felt

you could do.

COP

Sir? Everything all right?

ROY

Getting better. A bad shrimp, I

think.

COP

Want us to take you to a doctor?

ROY

No no, I'm fine now, thanks,

anyway. Still got a lot of clients

to see.

COP

Take it easy, now.

ROY

Oh, I will.

SIMMS

Put it this way, now. Say I rent to

a woman, well, she has to have a

room with a bath. I insist on it,

because otherwise she's got the

hall bath tied up all the time,

washing her goddamn hair and her

clothes and everything she can

think of.

SIMMS

Now, your minimum for a room with

bath is three hundred a month, just

for a place to sleep and no cooking

allowed.

And just how many of these tootsies

make that kind of money and have to

eat in restaurants and buy clothes

and --

ROY

Mr. Simms.

SIMMS

(fawning)

Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a

potential new neighbor, looking at--

ROY

(uninterested)

Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.

SIMMS

I'll send her right up.

SIMMS

I had my first hotel thirty-seven

years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas,

and that's where I began to learn

about women. They just don't make

the money, you see, not regular

they don't, and there's only one

way they can get it.

SIMMS

Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's

the fine type of person I have in

mind for here. Like yourself, I

have no doubt. He's a salesman,

regular as clockwork, has a suite

here. Fine man. Now, about these

women. At first, you know, they

just go out and do it now and then,

just enough to make ends meet. But

pretty soon they got that bank open

twenty-four hours a day, and then

you've got trouble. Hookers and

hotellin' just don't mix.

You'd think the cops'd be too busy

catching real criminals, not

snooping around after working

girls, but that's the way the gravy

stains, as the saying is, and I

don't fight it. An ounce of

prevention is my motto.

SIMMS

Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up

there, he's expecting you.

SIMMS

If you keep out the women in the

first place, see, you keep out the

hookers, and then you keep out the

cops, and that's how you have a

clean place.

MYRA (O.S.)

Roy?

ROY

Your medicine is here.

MYRA

(amused by clothing)

Well, well. In a real hurry, are

we?

ROY

Always, for you, baby.

MYRA

You aren't taking me for granted,

are you?

ROY

Taking you for granite?

ROY

That isn't granite. If that fell on

me, it wouldn't hurt at all.

MYRA

(playing along)

Are you sure?

ROY

(pulling her close)

Let's find out.

LILLY

I'm done here. Do I come back to

Baltimore?

IRV

Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.

LILLY

Delmar? I never go out to

California. That's a thousand miles

from here.

IRV

Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody

to handle playback this time. Come

on, Lilly, you don't argue with

Bobo.

LILLY

(fatalistic)

I know.

IRV

Take two, three days. Call when you

get there.

LILLY

Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang

gleez on the way.

MYRA

Roy?

ROY

Mm?

MYRA

Look at me.

ROY

Oh, I am, baby, believe me.

MYRA

Roy? It this all we have?

ROY

All? It ain't bad.

MYRA

No more than this?

ROY

What are you talking abut, Myra?

Marriage?

MYRA

I didn't say that. You aren't

marriage material.

MYRA

What's that?

ROY

Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do,

throw me off my game?

MYRA

(laughing)

No, baby. Come to Mama.

MYRA

Wore you out, did I? It's a good

woman you can't keep down, baby.

MYRA

Have a good sleep, baby. Call you

tomorrow.

ROY

Wait'll next year.

ROY

Damn that guy.

ROY

Smack.

ROY

Heads.

ROY

Heads.

ROY

Tails.

ROY

Tails.

ROY

(whispered)

How much can I bet?

DEALER

That's between you two. I got

nothing at stake here, I'm just

dealing.

SHILL

What if we both guess wrong? You

aren't gonna take...

ROPER

We got him now! Put down that big

bill you got.

ROY

(whispered)

The fifty or the hundred?

ROPER

The hundred! Hurry!

ROY

(doubtful)

The ace is what I want?

ROPER

Sure it is!

ROY

Is that okay?

SHILL

You're damn right that's okay.

DEALER

(picks up the cards)

Whoever finds the ace, wins.

ROY

(whispered)

Dark in here.

ROY

Too dark. I just can't see.

ROY

Let me borrow these, will you?

ROY

Now, that's better.

MINTZ

I didn't teach you that.

ROY

(whispered)

You taught me a lot. Then I

invented.

ROY

Let me see how you did that one.

MINTZ

Scram. Go home.

ROY

I can't. I just left home.

MINTZ

You're too young. You should be in

school.

ROY

I am in school.

MINTZ

Where's the five?

ROY

In your other hand.

LILLY

(hesitant)

Roy?

LILLY

Roy? You asleep?

ROY

Myra?

LILLY

(startled)

My God!

ROY

Lilly?

LILLY

Tell the doctor I work for Bobo

Justus, and this is an emergency.

Don't worry, he knows who Bobo is.

ROY

Go away, Lilly. Go away.

DOCTOR

(lugubrious)

The ambulance is on the way, for

what good it will do.

LILLY

What? He's going to be all right!

DOCTOR

Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some

sort of accident. He's had an

internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding

to death inside.

LILLY

Well, make it stop!

DOCTOR

His blood pressure is under a

hundred. I don't think he'll live

to get to the hospital.

LILLY

(icy, stern)

You know who I work for.

DOCTOR

Yes, yes, but that's --

LILLY

My son will be all right. If he

isn't, I'll have you killed.

CLERK

(handing key)

Your kid's in the back here. He's

crying.

LILLY

Roy? He's always crying.

CLERK

(sympathetic to Roy)

The kids beat him up, because his

home life is, uh, different.

LILLY

(ironic)

I like you, too.

CLERK

Roy, your mother's here.

LILLY

So what's your story today?

ROY

They twisted my arm.

LILLY

(laughing lightly)

Only one arm?

ROY

They knocked out my tooth!

LILLY

Only one tooth?

ROY

You always say that!

LILLY

Come on, kid, let's see if there's

any food in the house.

CLERK

(there's no food)

Hah.

MYRA (O.S.)

No, really, you're Roy's mother?

That's impossible!

LILLY (O.S.)

Not quite. But I'm not sure who you

are, Mrs... Langtry, was it?

MYRA (O.S.)

I'm Roy's friend.

LILLY

Yes. I imagine you're lots of

people's friend.

MYRA

Oh, of course, now that I see you

in the light, you're plenty old

enough to be Roy's mother.

LILLY

(sweet smile)

Aren't we all?

ROY

(very weak, but amused)

Play nice. Don't fight.

MYRA

Darling!

LILLY

Roy. You're going to be all right.

ROY

Sure I am. What made you turn up,

after all these years?

LILLY

I'm working down in San Diego. Just

for a few weeks.

(awkward laugh)

Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost

son.

ROY

(cold)

Nice to see you.

(turns to Myra)

What am I doing in here?

MYRA

You were bleeding inside, honey.

Remember that bruise you had?

ROY

You called the doctor, huh?

MYRA

(reluctant)

Well, no, Roy. Your mother found

you.

ROY

(tossing It away)

Oh, yeah?

(very casual, to Lilly)

Thanks.

(back to Myra)

How long do they say I'm in here?

MYRA

Roy... Your mom saved your life.

ROY

Yeah? Only one life?

LILLY

Second time I gave it to you.

ROY

I was kind of... inconvenient...

for Lilly.

LILLY

Well... You're all right now, I

guess. I have to get down to the

track.

ROY

(reluctant, but it's

necessary)

Thanks, uh, Lilly.

LILLY

(awkward laugh)

Don't mention it.

ROY

I guess I owe you my life.

LILLY

(faint smile)

You always did.

MYRA

"Down to the track?"

ROY

Her job.

MYRA

(bright smile)

I want to know everything about

you.

ROY

(easy grin)

You do. And once I'm out of here,

I'll remind you of the best parts.

MYRA

(angry, but defensive)

You heard the shower, didn't you?

MANAGER

I don't care about that. This time,

I gotta have the rent.

MYRA

Joe, I thought I was gonna be all

right by now, I just need a little

more --

MANAGER

It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my

wife. She knows what's going on.

This time, I gotta have the money.

MYRA

Joe, you know you'll --

MYRA

Joe, could we talk it over? Do you

want a drink?

MANAGER

My wife sent me here, Myra. For the

money. She's waiting.

MYRA

I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock?

Ten?

MANAGER

(trying to be determined)

This time...

MYRA

We'll work something out, Joe.

MYRA

I don't see why you're still here.

You look healthy to me.

ROY

I just do what the doctor says,

babe.

MYRA

You're just comfortable, that's

all. You don't even ask to go home.

You just lie around, let your mama

take care of you.

ROY

(truly astonished)

Mama!

MYRA

Who else is paying for all this?

You badmouth the woman all the

time, but you sure do take the

payoffs she gives you.

ROY

(insulted)

I'll pay Lilly back, don't you

worry about that.

MYRA

I don't like to come here, Roy.

Every time I do, your mother comes

in and makes remarks.

ROY

That's just Lilly's way.

MYRA

And you never defend me. You're

afraid of her.

ROY

Oh, don't be stupid.

MYRA

You're a mama's boy, if you want

the truth.

ROY

Are you kid --? I hadn't even seen

her in seven years!

LILLY

Should my ears be burning?

MYRA

(surly)

They might as well.

LILLY

I heard those skirts were coming

back.

MYRA

Get well soon.

ROY

(easy)

Every day in every way.

MYRA

I'll see you when you get home.

ROY

What happened to your hand?

LILLY

(casually dismissive)

Just a little accident. I went by

your place, picked up your mall.

Just bills, I'll take care of them.

ROY

I can take care of my own bills,

Lilly.

LILLY

(indifferent shrug)

Whatever you say. The manager says

your boss called.

(crooked grin)

Really pulled the wool over

everybody's eyes, huh?

ROY

What are you talking about? So I've

got a job. So what?

LILLY

Stop kidding me! Four years in a

town like Los Ang-gleez, and a

peanut selling job is the best you

can do? You expect me to believe

that?

ROY

(spreads hands; it's

obvious)

It's there. The boss called, you

said so yourself.

LILLY

And that dump you live in! Those

clown pictures on the walls!

ROY

I like those.

LILLY

You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball

clown pictures? Commission

salesman? It's all a front, isn't

it? You're on the grift, I know you

are. You're working some angle, and

don't tell me you're not because I

wrote the book!

ROY

(defensive)

You're one to talk. Still running

playback money for the mob.

LILLY

That's me. That's who I am. You

were never cut out for the rackets,

Roy, and if you --

ROY

How come?

LILLY

You aren't tough enough.

ROY

Not as tough as you, huh?

LILLY

(dead serious)

No. And you have to be.

LILLY

You asked me about this. You really

want to know what happened?

ROY

Up to you.

LILLY

My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus,

back in Baltimore. When a long shot

gets too much action, I have to put

money on that horse at the track,

because it's the only way to get

the odds down.

ROY

Sure.

LILLY

The first day of the Delmar meet,

there was a nag called Bluebell. I

should have been on it. But that

was the day after you came in here,

so I stuck around to see how you

were gonna be.

LILLY

That was my choice, nothing to do

with you. I took a chance, and it

didn't work out.

ROY

Bluebell came in?

LILLY

I sent Bobo ten grand of my own

money, like it was the winnings

from my bets. I hoped that would

cover me.

(shrug)

It didn't.

LILLY

Hi, Bobo.

BOBO

Did I buy you that dress, you piece

of shit?

LILLY

Well, I guess so. You're the guy I

work for.

BOBO

You work for me, huh? Then I just

may flush you down the toilet.

Drive me to the Durando.

BOBO

Bluebell.

BOBO

How'd you figure you were gonna get

away with that?

LILLY

I'm not getting away with anything,

Bobo.

BOBO

You're fuckin right you're not. How

much did your pals cut you in for

on that nag, huh? Or did they give

you the same kind of screwing you

gave me?

LILLY

I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not

as much as I should have been, but

there was a lot of action on those--

BOBO

One question. Do you want to stick

to that story, or do you want to

keep your teeth?

LILLY

I want to keep my teeth.

BOBO

Now I'll ask you another. You think

I got no contacts out here? That

nag paid off at just the opening

price. There wasn't hardly a

flutter on the tote board from the

time the odds were posted. There

ain't enough action to tickle the

tote, but you claim a ten grand

win!

You send me ten thousand dollars,

like I'm some mark you can blow

off!

LILLY

(terrified, broken)

Bobo, no, I --

BOBO

You wanna talk to me straight up?

LILLY

My son --

BOBO

Your what?

LILLY

My son was in the hospital --

BOBO

What the fuck are you doin with a

son?

LILLY

He left home a long time ago. He

was in the hospital, up in Los Ang

gleez, real sick.

BOBO

(utter scorn)

Motherhood.

LILLY

I never fucked up before, Bobo.

BOBO

You expect me to buy this?

LILLY

You do buy it, Bobo. I cost you,

and I'm sorry.

BOBO

I got a lot of people work for me,

Lilly. I can't have shit like this.

LILLY

(begging)

It'll never happen again. I swear.

BOBO

It happened once. With me, that's

making a habit of it.

LILLY

You're calling the shots.

BOBO

You got any kind of long coat in

the car? Anything you can wear home

over your clothes?

LILLY

(deadened with fear)

No.

BOBO

(doesn't matter)

I'll loan you a raincoat.

BOBO

(to the thugs)

Take a walk.

BOBO (CONT'D)

Get me a bath towel.

BOBO (CONT'D)

You ever hear about the oranges?

LILLY

You mean, the insurance frammis?

BOBO

Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.

BOBO (CONT'D)

While you put those in the towel.

LILLY

You hit a person with the oranges

in the towel, they get big, awful

looking bruises, but they don't

really get hurt, not if you do it

right. It's for working scams

against insurance companies.

BOBO

And if you do it wrong?

LILLY

It can louse up your insides. You

can get puh, puh, puh...

BOBO

(impatient)

What's that, Lilly?

LILLY

Permanent damage.

BOBO

You'll never shit right again.

BOBO (CONT'D)

(hard, impatient)

Bring me the towel.

BOBO (CONT'D)

Go clean yourself up.

BOBO (CONT'D)

The raincoat's on the bed.

BOBO

Almost forgot. That ten grand of

yours. It's in the envelope by the

door.

LILLY

(tries for animation)

Oh, thanks, Bobo.

BOBO

You want a drink?

LILLY

Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I

still gotta drive back up to Los

Ang-gleez.

BOBO

See your son, huh? Well, that's

nice. A side of you I didn't know,

Lilly.

LILLY

He's a good kid. A salesman.

BOBO

On the square, huh? And how are you

making out these days? Stealing

much?

LILLY

From you? My folks didn't raise any

stupid kids.

BOBO

Not skimming a thing, Lilly?

LILLY

Oh, well, you know. I just clip a

buck here and a buck there. Not

enough to notice.

BOBO

(honest approval)

That's right. Take a little, leave

a little.

LILLY

A person that don't look out for

himself is too dumb to look out for

anybody else. He's a liability,

right, Bobo?

BOBO

(this is his creed)

You're a thousand percent right!

LILLY

Or else he's working an angle. If

he doesn't steal a little, he's

steeling big.

BOBO

You know it, Lilly.

LILLY

You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I

don't know what there is about it,

but it somehow makes you look

taller.

BOBO

(delighted)

Yeah? You really think so? A lot of

people been telling me the same

thing.

LILLY

Well, you can tell them I said

they're right.

(looks at sky)

I better get going. Roy'll wonder

where I am.

BOBO

Worries about his mother, eh? Give

him a hug for me.

LILLY

I will. So long, Bobo.

LILLY

Lucky! Lucky! Oh, am I lucky.! Am I

lucky!

ROY

Lucky? You call that lucky?

LILLY

(simply)

He let me live. He let me be his

friend.

ROY

You don't put up with that! Nobody

has to put up with that!

LILLY

You do if you're where I am. Where

you want to be. How'd you get that

punch in the stomach, Roy?

ROY

I tripped over a chair.

LILLY

(calm maternal advice)

Get off the grift, Roy.

ROY

Why?

LILLY (CONT'D)

(faint smile)

You don't have the stomach for it.

LILLY

I just give you your life. What you

do with it is up to you.

ROY

(his back turned)

That's right.

MYRA  (V.O.)

(filtered; little-girl

flirtatious)

Myra here. Sorry you missed me.

Tell me how to reach you and I

will, just as soon as I can.

ROY

Babe, I'm gettin out of here, and

that's it. Let's take some time out

this weekend, go down to LaJolla,

hit the beach, have some fun.

Forget all this other stuff, huh?

SIMMS

Your difference between your folded

towel and your clean towel is a

trip to the laundry. When you're

cleaning those bathrooms, what you

do, you pick up the towel, you give

it a good shake and a good look,

and you say to yourself, 'Would I

dry myself on this towel?' If the

answer's yes, fold it.

MAID

What if it's wet?

SIMMS

Mr. Dillon! Welcome back! You look

fine, just fine.

ROY

Thanks, Mr. Simms, I'm feeling

fine.

MAID

(shy)

I'm glad you're better.

SIMMS

You're well liked around here, Mr.

Dillon. The entire staff will be

pleased to see you're back.

ROY

Well, thank you. And thank them.

SIMMS

Sickness comes to us all, Mister

Dillon.

ROY

That's true, Mr. Simms.

SIMMS

We never know when and we never

know why. We never know how. The

only blessed thing we know is,

it'll be at the most inconvenient

and unexpected time. Just when

you've got tickets to the World

Series. And that's the way the

permanent waves.

ROY

Well, I'm back now. I just wanted

you to know. Gotta rush.

SIMMS

Happy to see you looking so good.

SIMMS (CONT'D)

That fellow could be a congressman.

(turns to maid)

If it's wet, you don't fold it. You

shake it, and hang it neatly on the

rod provided.

MAID

Yes, sir.

ROY

(cheerful, confident)

Whadaya say?

KAGGS

(uptight, minimal)

Hello.

CLERK

Roy! Welcome back.

ROY

(approaching him)

What's going on? This is usually

coffee break time.

CLERK

Not since Kaggs showed up.

ROY

(happily basking)

Hey, yeah, I'm fine, everything's

great. What's this Kaggs? Sounds

like a disease.

2ND CLERK

It is.

CLERK

Troubleshooter from the main

office. Came out here right after

you went into the hospital, and he

ain't had a kind word for anybody

yet.

3RD CLERK

Nobody knows anything but him.

CLERK

He chopped off half a dozen

salesmen; won't wholesale to them

any more.

2ND CLERK

What kind of sense does that make?

They're all on commission.

ROY

(unworried)

You think he'll chop me?

CLERK

If he does, he's crazy.

2ND CLERK

Here he comes!

KAGGS

Kaggs. Home office.

ROY

(taking his hand)

Roy Dillon.

KAGGS

(keeping Roy's hand)

I know that. Knew it when I saw you

out there. The best salesman here,

which isn't saying much. Want to

talk to you, Dillon.

KAGGS (CONT'D)

What's up?

ROY

That was a pretty backhanded

compliment. If I let people get

away with things like that, I

wouldn't be a good salesman.

KAGGS

(brisk)

You're right. I apologize. But I

still want to talk to you.

ROY

Lead on.

KAGGS

Take a seat.

KAGGS

When I said you being the best

salesman here didn't say much, I

meant for us. I know your record

with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say

you're a top-flight man, but you've

had no incentive. No one walking on

your heels. Just a lot of half

asses, so the tendency's been not

to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing

the slobs, incidentally.

ROY

(dry)

So I heard.

KAGGS

Makes no difference to me if

they're only on commission. If they

don't make good money, they're not

giving us good representation, and

we can't afford to have them

around. Ever supervise salesmen?

ROY

Just myself.

KAGGS

That's right, you've had to

supervise yourself. This place

needs a sales manager. Somebody

who's proved he's a salesman and

can handle other salesmen. He'd

have a lot of deadwood to clear

out, new men to hire. What do you

think?

ROY

Sounds like a good Idea.

KAGGS

I don't know offhand what your best

year's been, we can look it up. The

idea is, we'll top it by fifteen

percent.

ROY

What? Me?

KAGGS

That's just the first year. If you

aren't worth a lot more than that

the second year, I'll kick you out.

What do you say?

ROY

Well, uh... No.

KAGGS

(astonished)

No?

ROY

I can't take that job! I mean, I

mean, I can't take it right away.

I'm still recuperating, I just

dropped in to say hello, see

everybody --

KAGGS

I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look

a little pale. How soon will you be

ready? A week?

ROY

But you need a man right now. It

wouldn't be fair to you to --

KAGGS

I take care of the being-fair-to-me

department. Things've gone to hell

this long, they can go a little

longer.

ROY

(trapped)

Well...

KAGGS

See you in a week, Roy. I can call

you Roy?

ROY

(rising)

Oh, sure. Fine.

KAGGS

And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm

afraid.

ROY

(distracted)

Perk.

ROY

This really is it. Union Station.

MYRA

I don't see why we have to take the

train.

ROY

Because it's comfortable.

MYRA

What if we want to drive somewhere

while we're there?

ROY

We'll rent a car.

MYRA

Big spender.

ROY

You ain't seen nothin.

ROY

Stretch my legs. Come along?

MYRA

No.

ROY

(unruffled)

See you soon.

ROY

Oh! Ow, I'm sorry! Oh, look, I

spilled your drinks!

SOLDIER

That's okay, don't worry about it.

SOLDIER 2

You okay, pal?

ROY

Let me buy you a new round.

SOLDIER

Hey, no, no problem.

SOLDIER 3

You didn't like spill much at all.

ROY

What are those, bloody Marys? Watch

this, I'll be back.

SOLDIER 3

(to Soldier 2)

Yeah, but it was you like told the

sergeant your grandmother was dead.

SOLDIER

(laughing)

Again!

SOLDIER 2

(to Soldier 3)

And you jumped right in.

(broad imitation)

I'll drive him, Sarge, he's too

distraught.

SOLDIER 4

(astonished)

Distraught? You said distraught?

ROY

Boy! You guys could've got in a lot

of trouble.

SOLDIER 3

Nah. Old Sarge, he's slowing down.

ROY

I don't know. I wouldn't take a

chance like that.

(looks at floor)

What's that?

ROY (CONT'D)

One of you fellows drop this?

SOLDIER 2

You can't buy every round!

SOLDIER 3

Like our turn!

ROY

Tell you what. We'll roll for it.

Low number buys.

ROY

Go ahead. You roll for the four of

you.

SOLDIER 2

Here goes.

SOLDIER 3

That's a four!

ROY

Told you I'd buy.

SOLDIER

It just doesn't seem fair, Tom.

ROY

Tell you what. Give me a chance to

get even when I come back.

DRUNK

Pretty woman like you shouldn't eat

alone. Whadaya wanna eat alone for?

LILLY

Go away.

LILLY (CONT'D)

(calling)

Could I have some coffee, please?

WAITRESS

Right away.

DRUNK

We could have coffee together. My

name's Kenny.

LILLY

Your pal wants you.

DRUNK

Let him find his own pretty woman.

WAITRESS

This fellow bothering you, Ma'am?

LILLY

Yes.

WAITRESS

(to the drunk)

Why don't you go sit down?

DRUNK

I'll sit here. Move over.

LILLY

Oh! Are you all right?

LILLY (CONT'D)

I shouldn't have hit him that hard.

I guess I don't know my own

strength.

FRIEND

You didn't have to do that.

LILLY

(matter of fact)

I thought I did. You should take

better care of your friend.

DRUNK

(mumbled)

Outta here.

LILLY

I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here

without being bothered.

WAITRESS

It won't happen again, Ma'am, I

promise. Dinner's on the house.

More chili? Dessert? We have lovely

pecan pie, my husband makes it

himself.

LILLY

That sounds nice. Pecan pie. Thank

you.

ROY

You were right, I had to get out of

that hospital. Nothing wrong with

me any more.

MYRA

(purring)

I'll sign that affidavit.

ROY

Great to get away, take it easy.

Next week, I'll get back to work.

MYRA

You already went back to work.

ROY

(confused)

What?

MYRA

(indulgent smile)

I watched you. Working the tap on

those soldier boys.

ROY

(elaborate innocence)

Working the what?

MYRA

Oh, come on, Roy.

MYRA

The tap. What you do for a living.

ROY

I'm a salesman.

MYRA

You're on the grift. Same as me.

ROY

(demonstrating patience)

Myra, I'm not following this.

MYRA

(demonstrating

exasperation)

Roy, you're a short-con operator.

And a good one, I think. Don't talk

to me like I'm another square.

ROY

You talk the lingo. What's your

pitch?

MYRA

The long end. Big con.

ROY

(shaking his head)

Nobody does that single-o.

MYRA

I was teamed ten years with the

best in the business. Cole Langley.

ROY

I've heard the name.

MYRA

It was beautiful. And getting

better all the time.

ROY

(skeptical)

Is that right?

MYRA

(enthusiasm building)

It is, Roy! And now, right now,

it's the perfect time, the best

time since I've been in the game.

MYRA (V.O.)

All over the southwest, you've got

these businessmen, they were making

money when everybody was making

money, they think that means

they're smart.

MYRA (V.O.)

And now they're hurting. Everything

they had was because of oil.

MYRA (V.O.)

They still got money, but they need

more money, and that's just the

kind of guy Cole and me like.

MYRA (V.O.)

When the oil money was good, they

put up all these office buildings,

and now they're half empty.

MYRA  (V.O.)

They'll give you anything to move

in; first two months free,

redecoration, whatever you want.

MYRA (V.O.)

They help you set up the store!

MYRA (V.O.)

I'm the roper, I go out and find

them and bring them in. Cole ran

the store, and he was the best.

COLE

Mary Beth! As beautiful as ever.

COLE

(gentle disapproval)

I see you brought a friend.

MYRA

Mister Hebbing is my bodyguard, my

strong right arm. Gloucester

Hebbing, may I present my fine

stockbroker, Henry Fellowes.

COLE

(to Myra; gentle warning)

Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...

MYRA

(gaily innocent)

Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about

it, how brilliant you are at making

money for your special clients!

COLE

(alarmed)

Mary Beth, I hope you aren't

spreading this good news too

widely.

MYRA

Well, of course not! I know how

dangerous this is. But I would

trust Mister Hebbing with anything.

(to Hebbing; suggestive)

Wouldn't I, darling?

COLE

Well, I'll have to take your word

for it, Mary Beth. Here's your

money.

MYRA

(innocent avarice)

Goody!

MYRA

Isn't that just beautiful?

HEBBING

Yes, it is.

MYRA

Henry, next time, couldn't Mister

Hebbing --

COLE

(shocked)

Mary Beth! This has never been

anything but --

MYRA

Oh, I know, I know, and you've been

wonderful since I was widowed. But

Mister Hebbing has--

(to Hebbing)

-- you don't mind my telling him,

darling --

(to Cole)

-- suffered reverses. If he

could...

HEBBING

Top up the tanks, as It were. Until

this little glitch in the oil

economy comes to an end.

(man to man laugh)

Not that I understand exactly what

you do, not from Mary Beth's

explanation.

COLE

Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you,

and if she told you the story

already...

MYRA

(girlish laugh)

So here we are!

COLE

(solemn)

Mister Hebbing, we are talking

about breaking the law here, I want

to be sure you understand that. No

one gets hurt, but the law does get

broken.

HEBBING

(a real sport; laughing)

Well, that's what the law's for,

isn't it?

COLE

(still serious)

And I don't just mean the SEC. We

could have the FBI breathing down

our necks.

HEBBING

(suddenly serious)

I certainly hope not.

COLE

Loose talk is the one thing I worry

about.

HEBBING

I can keep my mouth shut, Mister

Fellowes.

COLE

Okay, then. Sit down, sit down.

COLE

The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours

ahead of us, New York one hour

behind. There isn't one hour of the

day when both are open. Information

moves, but it has to wait. Now, we

have a young fellow working here --

Do you know what a hacker is,

Mister Hebbing?

HEBBING

One of those computer geniuses,

isn't it?

COLE

You're right! And this boy tapped

into that main link between Tokyo

and the New York Stock Exchange. He

can give us, when it's really

useful, a seven second delay in

that movement of information. Do

you know what that means?

HEBBING

Well, you've got your information

ahead of New York, I see that.

COLE

Every once in a while, a major

change comes through.

We have seven seconds to take

advantage, put our buy order, our

sell order, into the computer in

New York before the Tokyo data

comes in.

HEBBING

Not much time.

COLE

We have to be ready. We have to

have the money, and we have to know

what the information means, and we

have to move immediately.

HEBBING

(impressed)

Seven seconds. I don't see how you

do it.

COLE

These machines -- They're in here.

COLE

Want a look?

MYRA

Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.

COLE

Come take a look. An entire-suite

of main-frame computer.

MYRA (O.S.)

We're not really interested, Henry.

COLE

It's quite a sight. You sure?

MYRA

Henry, don't try Mister Hebbing's

patience. He knows what machines

look like.

COLE

Well, if you're sure.

ROY (V.O.)

Cole liked to take risks, huh?

MYRA

He didn't think they were risks. He

was so good, Roy, he could just

play with the mark.

ROY

And when he got serious?

MYRA

He'd explain he had to have cash,

so there wouldn't be any paper

trail for the SEC. And a lot of

cash, or it wasn't worth while. The

least we ever took was forty

thousand, and the most was one

hundred eighty-five thousand

dollars! From one sucker!

ROY

I thought these people were broke.

MYRA

No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They

had savings accounts, stocks to

sell, houses to mortgage. Sell

their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had

a lot of money, when they put their

minds to it.

Or when I put their minds to it. I

stayed with them, that's the

roper's job, made them get up every

penny they could raise, turn it all

over to Cole.

ROY

And a month later, the sucker calls

the cops and you're on the run.

MYRA

No no! He never calls the cops, not

after we give him the blow-off.

ROY

Yeah? How?

MYRA  (V.O.)

Three or four days after Cole got

the money, he'd phone the sucker,

tell him he'd made the move.

MYRA (V.O.)

Our buy was in the computer, we

were rich, he should come collect.

COLE

Here you are! Two rich people!

HEBBING

I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I

had moments I was worried.

COLE

You brought a case? Good.

MAN

Hold it right there!

COLE

(cool outrage)

What? This is a private office!

MAN

FBI! Stock fraud, tampering with

Exchange communications --

COLE

Oh, my God! No! The scandal!

SECOND MAN

Your name?

HEBBING

My --? I don't I only --

COLE

(screams at Myra)

You! You and your goddamn big

mouth!

KYRA

(terrified)

Henry, no, I --

COLE

Who did you tell? Who?

MYRA

Just one or two of the girls, just,

they wouldn't --

COLE

Don't move!

MAN

Mister Fellowes, that isn't going

to do you any good. Put that down,

and --

COLE

You ruined me! You destroyed me!

MYRA

Henry, no!

COLE

Get back! Get back!

COLE

I'll kill the first one that

follows me!

MYRA

Oh, Roy, it was great! We were

rolling in dough, lived wherever we

wanted, only pulled two or three

scams a year.

ROY

What happened to Cole?

MYRA

(suddenly evasive)

He retired.

ROY

Where?

MYRA

Upstate.

ROY

Upstate where?

MYRA

Atascadero.

ROY

That's where they keep the

criminally insane, isn't it?

MYRA

No, baby. Not again.

COLE

It's hollow. You'll fall through.

MYRA

Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?

COLE

(frightened but

determined)

Can't move.

MYRA

It's just the strain again, the

stress. We'll take a vacation.

COLE

It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.

MYRA

Cole, you scare me when this

happens. One of these times...

COLE

Demon! Demon! That's why you can

walk on it! Demon!

MYRA

(heartbroken)

Oh, Cole, please. Please come out

of it. What would I do without you?

MYRA

He retired, and that's it. But I

didn't. I'm still the best long-con

roper you'll ever see.

ROY

I just bet you are, too. And now

you're trying to rope me.

MYRA

(pushing enthusiasm)

Join up with you! I watched you,

Roy, I've been watching you,

wondering if I should talk about

this at all, or maybe just...

(shrug)

ROY

Take a hike, you mean?

MYRA

I need a partner, Roy. I need an

inside man, and you're it. You

could be as wonderful as Cole.

ROY

(dubious)

I don't know, Myra, I never had

partners. I never needed them.

MYRA

Not to take soldiers for a hundred

bucks. But how about taking a bank

president for a hundred grand?

MYRA

Think about it. Okay?

ROY

(easy to promise)

Sure.

MYRA

(coy, sexy)

See you later.

ROY

I still don't see why we have to

have separate rooms. You expect

your father to come through?

MYRA

Separate bathrooms, darling. I will

not lay out all my cosmetics for

you to knock over.

ROY

(nevertheless grumpy)

Things a man isn't supposed to

know.

MYRA

(soothing)

You don't mind, really, do you,

Roy? It's been such a wonderful

evening, I guess I just wore myself

out.

ROY

Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.

ROY

Long con. I'm the one's been

conned. Who needs this?

ROY

Yeah?

MYRA (V.O.)

(filtered)

Open your door.

ROY

What?

(grins; gets it)

What for?

MYRA (V.O.)

(filtered)

Open it and find out.

MYRA (CONT'D)

Gangway!

MYRA

(coquettish)

I hope you don't mind, sir. I just

washed my clothes, and I couldn't

do a thing with them.

ROY

You -- I don't know.

MYRA

(sudden burst of laughter)

)

If you could have seen your face

when I told you good night! You

looked so, so... Ah!

ROY

Oh, come here.

LILLY

Roy! What are you doing in San

Diego?

ROY

(entering)

Myra and me come down to LaJolla

for the weekend.

LILLY

If you come out to the track, don't

know me.

ROY

We won't hit the track. The beach.

Couple a nice restaurants.

LILLY

What's that?

ROY

Four grand. For the hospital. Is

that enough?

LILLY

(distressed)

Roy, I don't want money from you.

ROY

I pay my debts.

LILLY

(level skeptical look)

You do?

ROY

Expecting visitors?

LILLY

No. That was the point.

ROY

You ought to put a bandage on that.

LILLY

No can do. Have to dip in and out

of my bag too much. Besides, it'll

heal in the air.

LILLY (CONT'D)

Roy, take that back.

ROY

No.

LILLY

I thought... I was hoping we could

play it straight with one another.

ROY

I guess not. You'll be heading east

from here, huh?

LILLY

(dull)

After the meet. Back to Baltimore.

ROY

Well... nice to see you again,

Lilly.

LILLY

You, too, Roy.

LILLY

Prick.

DRIVER

Here he comes.

MYRA

I see him.

MYRA (CONT'D)

Wait. Hold it.

DRIVER

That's the guy we're following.

MYRA

Just wait.

MYRA (CONT'D)

Ah.

MYRA (CONT'D)

Now we follow her.

DRIVER

You're the boss.

BLONDE

You stay down real good.

ROY

One of my talents.

BLONDE

(pointing upward)

Your mother's calling.

ROY

Naughty.

MYRA (O.S.)

Roy! You drown in there?

ROY

Be right out!

ROY

You were gone for a while.

MYRA

(casual)

I went out to Delmar.

ROY

(suddenly wary) )

The track? Did you run into Lilly?

MYRA

I saw her.

ROY

She didn't see you, in other words.

MYRA

I'm not trying to make trouble,

Roy. It's just, she's always so

nasty to me, I thought, who is she

to be so high and mighty. I saw her

out there, and I called a friend of

mine in Baltimore, so now I know

who she is.

ROY

(dry)

You must have some very

knowledgeable friends.

MYRA

I'm well connected, Roy, Cole

introduced me to a lot of people.

Very valuable. Valuable for us.

ROY

Running your broker scam, you mean.

MYRA

(enthusiastic)

You and me, Roy. What a team we'll

make. We think alike; we get along

together.

Once or twice a year we take some

slob, the rest of the time we live

like this. You won't regret this,

Roy.

ROY

Regret what? I didn't say I was

coming aboard.

MYRA

But why not? I thought it was

settled. What's holding you back?

ROY

Come on, Myra, don't talk business

here. This is time out.

MYRA

You mean, it would be too tough to

give me a turndown here. Easier on

home grounds.

ROY

(shrug)

Yes or no. They're both easier at

home. Okay?

MYRA

Whatever you say, darling.

KAGGS

Yeah?

RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)

Roy Dillon, Mr. Kaggs.

KAGGS

Good! Send him in.

KAGGS

Good to have you back, Roy. I was

just looking at --

ROY

Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.

KAGGS

(keen)

You're turning me down? Makes no

sense, Roy.

ROY

I guess I'm just not a leader of

men.

KAGGS

Oh, come on, Roy.

ROY

The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --

KAGGS

Perk, remember?

ROY

Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I

like things the way they are now.

Pick my own hours, have time for,

uh, other activities...

KAGGS

A well-rounded life. I respect

that. But it has to have a center,

Roy, something you care about,

something you can think about.

ROY

Maybe I'm just not ready for that

yet.

KAGGS

(deep sigh)

Well, Roy, if that's the way you

feel, I won't badger you.

(forced laugh)

Don't want to lose you as a

salesman, too.

ROY

Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep

everything the way it was.

KAGGS

That's what we'll do, then. But I

tell you what, Roy. Before I hire

anybody else, I'll ask you one last

time. Fair enough?

ROY

Fair enough.

MYRA

Darling, guess what? I had to tell

you right away.

ROY

(grinning)

And hello to you, too.

MYRA

I called a fellow I know in Tulsa,

the one who plays my chauffeur.

There's a sucker there he says is

made for us. And a boroker that

just shut down, we can use their

office, not change a thing! Now, I

can scrape up ten grand without

much trouble. That leaves fifteen

or twenty for your end. We could

start this weekend, get the sucker

into position --

ROY

Wait a minute! When did this

happen, that we're partners?

MYRA

(bewildered)

What?

ROY

The last I looked, we were just

talking things over.

MYRA

But the setup's there. It's there

now.

ROY

I don't think I need it.

MYRA

You're too good for the small-time,

Roy. Move up to where there's big

dough to be made, and you don't

have to stick your neck out every

day.

ROY

Maybe I like it where I am.

MYRA

Well, maybe I don't! I had ten good

years with Cole, and I want them

back! I gotta have a partner! I

looked and I looked and believe me,

brother, I kissed a lot of fucking

frogs, and you're my prince!

ROY

Don't I get any say in this?

MYRA

No! Because I --

ROY

(pointing at her)

That's what I say.

MYRA

(thrown off course)

What?

ROY

What I say is, no. We don't do

partners.

MYRA (CONT'D)

(raging)

For Christ's sake, why not?

ROY

Mostly, because you scare the shit

out of me. I've seen people like

you before, baby. Double-tough and

sharp as they come, and you get

what you want or else. But you

don't make it work forever.

MYRA

Bullshit!

ROY

No; history. Sooner or later, the

lightning hits. I don't want to be

around when it hits you.

MYRA

What is it? What's going on?

ROY

I'm happy the way I am.

MYRA

By God, it's your mother. It's

Lilly.

ROY

(doesn't get it) )

What?

MYRA

Sure it is. That's why you act so

funny around each other.

ROY

What's that?

MYRA

Don't act so goddamned innocent!

You and your own mother, gah! You

like to go back where you been,

huh?

ROY

You watch that mouth.

MYRA

I'm wise to you, I should have seen

it before, you rotten son of a

bitch. How is it, huh? How do you

like --

ROY

How do you like this?

MYRA

STOP!!

ROY

That's not like me. I don't do

violence.

ROY

That's why we wouldn't work

together. You're disgusting. Your

mind's so filthy, it's hard even to

look at you.

ROY

Goodbye, Myra.

MYRA

And you don't even know it.

MYRA

Mama. It's Mama. She's the one.

MYRA

You'll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes.

LILLY

Yes?

LILLY

Roy! An unexpected pleasure.

ROY

Lilly, I've got a couple things to

think about. Well, kind of job

offers, kind of. Different ways to

go. I'd kind of like to talk them

out, you know? Maybe just hear

myself talk.

LILLY

Well, sure, Roy. You want me to

drive up --? Okay, fine, come on

down.

(kidding)

It won't be a home-cooked meal, you

know.

ROY

(kidding)

Well, that's good news.

ROY

Well? Who's a boy gonna talk to, if

not his mother?

LILLY

(expecting rejection)

Roy?

IRV

Lilly, listen, it's Irv. You were

always decent with me, I'm taking a

hell of a chance here.

Somebody blew you out with Bobo.

The car full of money. He's --

Lilly?

ROY

Damn.

THUG

Somebody spooked her.

SECOND THUG

White Chrysler.

THUG

Full of cash.

ROY

(disgusted)

Thanks a lot, Lilly.

CLERK

Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.

LILLY

Good evening. I'd like a single for

tonight.

CLERK

Oh, everything's the same size,

same price.

LILLY

I'm a very light sleeper, traffic

noise keeps me wide awake all

night.

CLERK

(sympathetic)

Those trucks. I know exactly what

you mean.

LILLY

Do you have something around back,

facing away from the road?

CLERK

I'll put you in one thirty-one.

Very quiet. Faces the desert.

LILLY

Sounds perfect. I can park my car

back there?

CLERK

Right in front of the room.

LILLY

Fine.

LILLY

And I'll want to leave an early

wake-up call.

CLERK

No problem. My husband gets up the

crack of dawn.

(confidential)

It's his kidneys.

CLERK

Something wrong?

(embarrassed)

I'm sorry. I thought you were the

other lady.

MYRA

No. I'm me.

CLERK

I'll give you one oh seven. That's

a very nice room, very handy, in

the front, right by the pool.

MYRA

Oh, don't you have something around

back, where it's quieter?

CLERK

Everybody wants the back tonight.

MYRA

I guess everybody wants privacy.

PIERSON

Roy Dillon?

ROY

Yes?

PIERSON

Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police.

I have a car here.

ROY

Thank you.

PIERSON

I realize this is a shock.

ROY

Well, mostly, I don't believe it.

PIERSON

That's natural.

ROY

No. I mean, I don't believe it.

Lilly is not a suicide. I know my

mother, nothing would make her

check out.

PIERSON

I'm sorry, it was her all right.

Her gun, even.

ROY

Gun?

PIERSON

I grant you, it's a little odd,

shoot yourself with a gun with a

silencer on it, but it was hers,

all right. It really is your

mother, Mister Dillon.

ROY

It may be Lilly, but it isn't

suicide.

PIERSON

(interested)

Do you have any particular reason

to say that?

ROY

My mother... Well, I guess it

doesn't matter now. She worked for

gamblers. She always knew they

might turn on her some day.

PIERSON

(thoughtful)

A hit, you mean. Honestly, it

doesn't have that feel to it, but

I'll certainly consider the

possibility. Thank you for telling

me.

ROY

Not that it matters.

(looks out)

This is the morgue?

PIERSON

You up to it now?

ROY

Sure. Let's get it over.

PIERSON

One thing I have to caution you

about. A gunshot wound...

ROY

(impatient)

Yes, I know, I know.

PIERSON

(reluctant)

Well, uh, you know, she ate the

gun.

ROY

(not understanding)

What?

PIERSON

I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate

phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to

tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon,

this isn't an everyday occurrence

around here.

ROY

(low; getting it)

Ate the gun. Oh.

PIERSON

Someone who knows her well could

still identify her, that's not the

problem. It's just there's, uh,

it's likely to be a shock.

ROY

(opening the door)

Well, let's get the shock over

with.

ROY

Not many laughs in this room, eh?

PIERSON

Not many.

PIERSON (CONT'D)

(to the attendant)

Remove that. We'll want a full, uh,

identification.

ROY

Oh, Jesus.

PIERSON

No question, huh?

ROY

No, its -- Why did she--?

PIERSON  (O.S.)

That's that, then.

ROY

(starting to grin)

Oh, yeah. That's that.

ROY (CONT'D)

(laughing quietly)

Mom.

SIMMS

The last modern thing I liked was

the miniskirt. Your technology,

now, nobody understands it, and

that's the simple fact of the

situation.

SIMMS

(calling) )

Evening, Mizz Langley!

SIMMS

New things come in here all the

time, how do they work? You can ask

your Ph.Ds, your highly educated,

intelligent, professional people,

you can say to them, how does that

work, and you know what they'll

tell you? You plug it in. And

that's the way the donut dunks.

ROY (O.S.)

Hello, Lilly.

LILLY

Oh! Roy! You scared me.

ROY

Going somewhere?

LILLY

Somewhere else, that's for sure.

ROY

I just came back from Phoenix.

LILLY

(anxious)

Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?

ROY

Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down.

Take a minute, tell me about it.

LILLY

I've really got to --

ROY

You're dead, Lilly, it worked.

LILLY

Not for long. Not when they do a

fingerprint check.

ROY

Why should they? The cops are

satisfied.

LILLY

Bobo won't be. He'll spend the

money to make sure.

ROY

Even so. You still got time. Relax

a minute, tell me what happened.

Sit down.

LILLY

Just for a minute.

ROY

Myra followed you, huh?

LILLY

She must have been the one that

blew me off with Bobo. I guess to

get me running. Did you tell her

about my stash?

ROY

(isn't worth discussing)

No.

LILLY

No, you wouldn't. That's what she

was after, though. But why hit on

me?

ROY

I wouldn't go in on a deal with

her. She blamed you for it.

LILLY

(a shaky laugh)

As though you do what I say.

ROY

(cold grin)

That's pretty funny, all right.

What happened in Phoenix?

LILLY

Roy, it was terrible. You read

about people killing people and all

that, but when it happens, my God.

LILLY

She was in her nightgown, you know,

the old grifter's dodge, nightgown

and the Ice bucket and she just got

into the wrong room by mistake.

LILLY

I sat in there with her, I thought,

what do I do now? Run and I've got

Bobo and the law after me. Stay,

and how do I explain?

ROY

This way's perfect.

LILLY

It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a

break for me after all.

I've been wanting out of the racket

for years, and now I'm out. I can

make a clean start, and --

ROY

You've already made a start.

Doesn't look that clean, though.

LILLY

I'm sorry. I hated to take your

money, but --

ROY

Don't be sorry. You're not taking

it.

LILLY

I need this, Roy. I can't run

without money, and if I can't run

I'm dead.

ROY

You must have some money.

LILLY

Just a few bucks.

ROY

And Myra's stuff?

LILLY

(scornful)

Her credit cards. How far am I

gonna get with that?

ROY

Far enough. Maybe up to San

Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace

new. Start over.

LILLY

At what?

ROY

You're smart, Lilly, and you're

good-looking. You won't have any

trouble finding a job.

LILLY

(appalled)

A job? I've never had a legit job

in my life!

ROY

Well, you're gonna start, if you

hope to live through this. A square

job and a quiet life. You start

showing up at the track or the hot

spots and Bobo's boys will be all

over you.

LILLY

(exasperated)

Roy, I know what to do with myself!

It's a big world out there.

ROY

Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm

giving you good advice. I'm

following it myself.

LILLY

(doesn't get it)

What?

ROY

I thought it over, and you were

right. You wanted me out of the

rackets, and now --

LILLY

(bedeviled, aggravated)

Roy, that's fine, but I don't have

time for this. Bobo --

ROY

I thought you'd be happy for me.

After all, you --

LILLY

Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after

me, and he's goddamn good! But so

am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I

survive.

ROY

I know you do, so that's why --

LILLY

And to survive, my way, I need

money.

Bobo knows about the stash in the

car, so I didn't dare touch it, not

if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that

leaves this.

ROY

No.

LILLY

You want a drink?

ROY

I don't think so. You probably

shouldn't either.

LILLY

No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice

water?

ROY

Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.

LILLY

I'll get it.

LILLY

Take whichever one you want.

ROY

You wouldn't do that.

LILLY

You don't know what I'd do, Roy.

You have no idea. To live.

ROY

(easy)

Oh, you'll live, Lilly.

LILLY

I know what's bugging you, of

course.

ROY

Oh? I didn't know anything was.

LILLY

(twisted grin)

Oh, really? You've got a legitimate

complaint, Roy, I don't deny that.

I wasn't a very good mother when

you were a kid.

ROY

(full laugh)

Not very good!

LILLY

A bad mother. By any standards.

I've thought about it, you know,

from your side, since then. I know

just how bad I was.

ROY

(closed against her)

Uh-huh.

LILLY

I wonder did you ever think about

it from my side.

ROY

(not worth discussing)

Never.

LILLY

No, I guess not. It was pretty

lousy of me, I guess, to be a child

at the same time you were. Not to

stop being a child just because I

had a child. I guess I was a real

stinker not to be a grown-up when

you needed a grown-up.

ROY

What do you want me to do? Pin a

halo on you? You're doing a pretty

good job of that yourself.

LILLY

And making you feel bad at the same

time, huh? But that's the way I am,

you know, the way I've always been.

Always picking on poor little Roy.

ROY

For God's sake, Lilly!

LILLY

(intense)

I gave you your life twice. I'm

asking you to give me mine once. I

need the money.

ROY

(not worth discussing)

No.

LILLY

You're getting off the grift?

ROY

That's right.

LILLY

That's good. You don't really

belong on this side of the fence,

you know.

ROY

(amused)

I don't?

LILLY

If you stayed a crook, do you think

you'd live to be my ripe age?

ROY

I don't see why not.

LILLY

Well, I guess I got it wrong, then.

Seems to me I heard about a guy

just your age that got hit so hard

in the guts it almost killed him.

ROY

Well, uh...

LILLY

Sure, sure, that doesn't count.

That's different.

ROY

Well, it doesn't matter, does it?

I'm getting out.

LILLY

(intense)

And that's why you've got to get

rid of this money. If you keep it

around, it'll just make you think

how clever you are.

It'll be a temptation to get back

into the game.

ROY

(full laugh)

Oh, that's it! You're stealing my

money for my own good! How very

motherly of you, Lilly.

ROY

Lilly.

ROY

If I should get out of the racket,

that goes double for you. That's

why you've got to change your life

completely, go to some town, get a

square job, live like a john

yourself. If you try to do it your

way, what future is in it?

LILLY

A future. The only future I've got.

ROY

That money wouldn't last forever.

And then what? You'd be back in

some other part of the rackets.

Another Bobo Justus to slap you

around and burn holes in your

hands. This way, you've got to go

the square route. You could send me

a card when you're settled, I could

maybe help out sometimes...

LILLY

(bitter laugh) )

That's what it is, isn't it? Keep

me down. Your turn to be in charge,

have the power.

ROY

(stonewalling)

Just trying to help, Lilly.

LILLY

Roy... What if I told you I wasn't

really your mother? That we weren't

related?

ROY

(bewildered)

What?

LILLY

You'd like that, wouldn't you? Sure

you would. You don't need to tell

me. Now, why would you like it,

Roy?

ROY

(hoarse)

What's that all about? Of course

you're my mother. Of course you

are.

LILLY

(very soft)

Roy... Roy

ROY

There's nothing more to talk about.

LILLY

(very soft)

I have to have that money, Roy.

What do I have to do to get it?

LILLY

No? Won't you give me the money,

Roy? Can't I change your mind? What

can I do to change your mind?

ROY

Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?

LILLY

Is there nothing I can do, Roy,

nothing at --

ROY

NO!

THE END
