Early Draft

FOR EDUCATIONAL

PURPOSES ONLY

CUT TO BLACK:

RANDOLPH

(singing)

'Friends come in all sizes

That's a fact! It's True!

All colors of the rainbow

from Mauve to Blue...

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

2.

RANDOLPH (CONT'D)

Their names may not be different

and their shoes may not match

One might say 'grasp' while the

other says 'snatch'

Some like to toss while others

like to caaaaatch... Beeee-

caaaause...

Friends come in all sizes

Take it from me! Golly Gee! Size

never matters when you want some

friendly patter

From a pal who is true and can

lift you when you're blue

You can count on him and he can

count on yoooouuuu!

It's true... that...

(big finish)

Friends come in all sizes!'

DISSOLVE TO:

HUSBAND

So... uh... you'll make sure my

boy dances up front, right? Where

he'll get the most camera time?

RANDOLPH

You want your kid on the show?

(CONTINUED)

3.

HUSBAND

Of... of course.

WIFE

Yes, very much.

RANDOLPH

Then don't tell me how to run my

fucking business.

HUSBAND

No, no, we were just --

RANDOLPH

I'll call you if a spot opens up.

HUSBAND

Freeze, you cocksucker!

WIFE

Drop the briefcase!

CUT BACK TO:

4.

STOKES

(addressing the brass)

Gentlemen, let me be the first to

say, in all sobriety, that I'm as

shocked and outraged as all of --

CEO

Save it for the papers, Stokes.

We've got nervous sponsors and an

angry public -- a combination

uglier than two monkeys fucking.

What are you doing about it?

STOKES

Well, sir, I'm currently in the

process of compiling a list of

viable replacements and it's my

hope...

CEO

Clean replacements?    With

background checks? I assure you,

Mr. Stokes, this network cannot

survive another Rainbow Randolph.

The goddamn P.R. department looks

like the Jim Jones camp.

EXECUTIVE #1

Remember, Stokes, this was your

dog that crapped on our rug.

EXECUTIVE #2

We trusted you, Frank. And now

we're in a tight spot. We have to

post our quarterly earnings next

month, for Christ's sake.

CEO

Whoever takes that slot has to be

a straight arrow. Clean as a

whistle.

EXECUTIVE #3

Right. Someone who'll take the

heat off. One of those sweater

types. Any chance of luring Fred

Rogers away from P.B.S.?

(CONTINUED)

5.

EXECUTIVE #4

Yeah, if we back up the Brinks

truck.

EXECUTIVE #1

No way. The idea now is to stop

the hemorrhaging.

EXECUTIVE #2

You better fix this, Stokes. Get

us a white bread replacement,

fast. Bland, milk toast. Not a

speck of controversy.

CEO

(calm and measured)

Squeaky fucking clean.

STOKES

Bumble Bee Billy?

NORA

(reading from a list)

Wife beater.

STOKES

Square Dance Danny?

NORA

Still appealing the mail fraud

thing.

STOKES

Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls?

NORA

Black was deported, and the

trolls... well, who gives a shit.

(CONTINUED)

6.

NORA

This is impossible. If I ever see

that Rainbow Randolph again I'll

strangle him. Choke the life out

of him. Squeeze his scrawny neck

until his eyes pop out of his

skull and bounce off the walls...

STOKES

Before indulging such cheery

fantasies, let's just concentrate

on saving my job. Shall we?

NORA

Sorry, Frank.

STOKES

What's going on with Sheldon Mopes

these days.

NORA

Oh my God. Have we sunk to that

level already? Smoochy the Rhino?

What a sap.

STOKES

Sap's just the pill we need right

now. Mopes is a straight arrow.

Always has been.

NORA

The guy can't get arrested, Frank.

He can't even break into the

birthday party circuit. Last I

heard he was working hospitals and

nursing homes. He's a joke.

STOKES

The truth of the matter is, a

successful children's show has

always depended on two simple

elements: a fuzzy costume and a

lot of hype. Strip away the foam

rubber and the network money and

they're all jokes. Marginal

talents.. cabaret acts... off-

Broadway runoff...

(CONTINUED)

7.

NORA

I probably have ten acts in my

development file -- acts I've been

cultivating -- that are more

deserving than Sheldon Mopes.

STOKES

And each one a moral question

mark. Something I can't risk at

the moment.

NORA

(frustrated)

We can do better than this guy,

Frank. He brings nothing to the

table.

STOKES

Except ethics. With Mopes,

there's never been a whiff of

controversy. The man's an

ethical, harmless, cornball. In

short, a glass of milk on two

legs.

NORA

Don't ask me to do it. You know

I'll do anything for you, but

please... not this...

STOKES

Go find Smoochy.

(CONTINUED)

8.

SMOOCHY (SHELDON)

(singing to the tune

of 'She'll be Comin'

round the Mountain')

'We'll get that monkey off your

back,

Yes we will, yes we will

We'll get that monkey off your

back,

Yes we will...'

'We'll get that monkey off your

back

And get your life right back on

track

If you'll just give up the smack

Yes you will, yes you will!!'

SMOOCHY

Thanks, fellas. I'm rooting for

you!

NORA

Mr. Mopes?

SHELDON

Yeah?

(CONTINUED)

9.

NORA

I, uh, saw your performance

tonight. Very...

(searching)

... spirited.

SHELDON

Really? Thanks. I would've done

a longer set if that guy hadn't

pulled a knife on the security

guard. Once the pepper spray

starts flyin', that's it for the

encores.

NORA

Yes, that did put a damper on the

evening, didn't it?

SHELDON

Are you a new patient?   On the

juice, as we say?

NORA

Ah, no. But it's sweet of you to

assume so.

SHELDON

'Nora Bishop. V.P. of

Development. Kidnet.'

(to Nora)

Good gravy. You work for Kidnet?

NORA

As stated.

SHELDON

Well, it's a pleasure to meet you,

Nora. A real honor. Hey, you

hungry?

(CONTINUED)

10.

SHELDON

(with full mouth)

Soy dogs... never thought I'd

live to see the day. Organic,

rich in natural protein, and

nobody gets killed. Although I

do feel bad for the beans. Just

kidding. Sure you don't want one?

NORA

Believe it or not, no.

SHELDON

So anyway, like I was saying,

people always tell me, 'You gotta

network, Sheldon... you gotta sell

yourself... or you'll be playing

the drug clinics and shopping

centers the rest of your life.'

And you know what I tell 'em?

NORA

I haven't the foggiest.

SHELDON

I tell 'em, it's not about the old

handshake and back slap game.

It's not about adding fuel to the

shlock machine. It's about doing

good work. Having integrity.

Making people happy and delivering

a positive message. Foundations

are built with concrete, not

plaster of Paris!

SHELDON

This is concrete!   This is

integrity!

NORA

(calmly)

I can see that.

SHELDON

Sorry. As you can imagine, living

by your convictions can be a

little stressful at times.

(CONTINUED)

11.

NORA

We all have our cross to bear.

SHELDON

See, I was raised by my

grandfather, and Grandpop paved

driveways for a living...

NORA

Are we going into a story?

SHELDON

Thing is, he didn't really pave

them. Just covered them with

black paint. Of course, once the

first rain came along, people

realized they'd been swindled. I

vowed to myself back then that I'd

never make a living through

deception. Never. Whadda ya

think of them apples?

NORA

The reason I'm here today, Mr.

Mopes, as fate would have it,

Kidnet is currently looking for a

performer with... convictions.

And integrity. Someone like...

NORA

... yourself.

SHELDON

Yeah, right. Got any more jokes?

NORA

I don't think I could top that

one.

SHELDON

Hold the phone. You're telling me

that Kidnet is finally ready to do

a show of Smoochy quality? Of

Smoochy caliber?

(CONTINUED)

12.

NORA

(dryly)

Yes... I believe we're ready to

push ourselves to that level.

SHELDON

I knew this day   would come!

After all these   years I finally

meet someone in   the business who

gets what I do.    Who gets what I'm

all about. You    get me, don't you,

Nora?

NORA

I'm afraid so.

SHELDON

Well, Miss V.P. of Development...

let's go make history!

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

13.

DISSOLVE BACK TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

SMOOCHY

Angelo, you were always my favorite

Krinkle Kid. The way you'd click

your heels during the 'Jellybean

Jam.' Real artistry. I'm honored

to have you as a Rhinette.

ANGELO

A job's a job.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

Hey, kids! Who's your favorite

rhino?

KIDS

Smoochy!

SMOOCHY

Hiya, kids!

(CONTINUED)

14.

KIDS

Hi, Smoochy!

SMOOCHY

It's gonna be a fantabulous day in

Smoochyland!!

SMOOCHY

(singing)

'Ohhhh... it's a fantabulous day

in Smoochy-land/Let's have a great

big cheer for the Smoochy-land

band/We'll dance with our jungle

pals, won't that be grand/Oh, it's

a fantabulous day in Smoochy-

land!'

RANDOLPH

I was starting to think that maybe

you weren't coming.

STOKES

I agreed to meet you, didn't I?    I

had a dinner engagement.

RANDOLPH

Really? You know, I used to have

dinner engagements. Sometimes

four, five a night. Dinner...

drinks... I was the toast of the

fucking town.

STOKES

Don't start, Randolph.   Please.

(CONTINUED)

15.

RANDOLPH

(voice rising)

Cars, boats, whores and horses, I

had 'em all. When I walked into a

restaurant, ten guys reached for

my hat. When I stood up to take a

piss, they cleared the rest room.

I'd walk down the street and

traffic stopped, mouths gaped.

You know why? You know why,

Frank?

(now shouting)

I was Rainbow fucking Randolph!

That's why!

STOKES

Are you through?

RANDOLPH

What? You're in a hurry? You

don't have time for me? The guy

who earned for you? The guy who

put those fucking suits on your

back and the pheasant au vin in

your Brooklyn mouth?

STOKES

I think it's fair to say we helped

each other.

RANDOLPH

(pleading)

You gotta fix it, Frank. You

gotta get me my slot back.

RANDOLPH

How can I sit around while that

rhinoceros... that horned

carpetbagger gets a free ride on

my dime? You and I have history,

Frank! Please!

STOKES

There's nothing I can do for you.

Nothing. You're a pariah. I

can't even be seen with you.

(CONTINUED)

16.

RANDOLPH

Don't do this to me, Frank. I'm in

deep, deep shit. They kicked me out

of the corporate penthouse... I got

bookies breathing down my neck.

I'm homeless! Don't you hear what

I'm saying? I'm not gonna make it!

The clock's ticking! Put yourself

in my shoes, for Christ's sake!

STOKES

The ugly truth is, your shoes have

become my shoes. As long as the

rhino's on the air, everything's

by the book. No skim, no

percentage. Nothing. The network

wanted squeaky clean and they got

it. And believe me, Mopes is

sparkling.

STOKES

You're totally broke? You don't

have a dime left to your name?

RANDOLPH

Yes! Exactly! That's what I'm

trying to tell you!

STOKE

Don't contact me again, Randy.

Ever.

RANDOLPH

You'll get yours, Frank! The rhino

too! Do you hear me?! The wheels

are turning!

RANDOLPH

(quietly to

himself)

Sooner or later, even a guy who's

squeaky clean falls into mud.

17.

FADE OUT.

NORA

Again, these are just prototypes.

I've been assured by FunZone that

all the bugs will be worked out

before Christmas.

NORA

Okay, so let's recap before we

break up...

(refers to notes)

Yes to the Smoochy ice pops. No to

the Smoochy string cheese. And

we're in a dick-measuring contest

with Brown & Brown over the

shampoo split.

SHELDON

Okay, time out, people! If I may

interject, I think we're putting

the cart before the horse here...

(CONTINUED)

18.

SHELDON

Smoochy's still earning the trust

of the kids. We don't want to

compromise that by asking them to

buy shampoo and cheese. How 'bout we

just concentrate on doing the best

show possible. Huh? Without all

the bells and whistles and

rickata-rackita. What do you say,

guys?

NORA

(monotone)

Oh, damn.

SHELDON

No problem, I'll get it.

NORA

(to staffer)

Shut the door please, John.

NORA

Now lock it.

NORA

Thank you.

SHELDON

Hey, Nora, wait up.

(CONTINUED)

19.

SHELDON

Good meeting today. I thought we

tackled some hot issues.

Although, I'll be honest, there

were a few times that I felt my

voice wasn't being heard.

NORA

I think that's a conservative

estimate.

SHELDON

I just want the show to have some

weight, you know? Some substance.

Silly songs, sure -- but with a

message. Pop quiz: How many

original compositions are in the

Smoochy songbook?

NORA

Do you sense my complete lack of

interest?

SHELDON

Try two thousand. Covering every

topic from how yummy vegetables

are to the importance of donating

plasma. Don't you get it, Nora?

I'm a valuable resource. Use me.

NORA

Can I make this real easy for you?

SHELDON

Sure.

NORA

The only reason you're on TV right

now is because Rainbow Randolph is

a degenerate scumbag. I didn't

discover you, I delivered you.

Like a bag of groceries. I have a

bigger emotional investment in my

nail polish. So don't peddle your

sap to me, rhino. Your job is

just to smile and nod your head.

20.

SHELDON

... No, no, you misunderstand me.

It's not that I'm literally

comparing Captain Kangaroo to

Jesus Christ. I'm just saying

that the Captain, like Christ, was

someone you could believe in.

Those guys didn't care about bells

and whistles and rickita-rackata.

It was all about the work.

Especially Jesus. Forget about

it.

SHELDON

(waving him off)

That's okay, my good man.    Three's

my limit.

BARTENDER

I never saw anyone get loaded on

orange juice before.

SHELDON

Back in my college days I could

put away a carton of the stuff.

BURKE

(to Bartender)

Gimme a Five Crown.

BURKE

Smoochy the Rhino.    Wow.   I'm a

big fan.

SHELDON

(flattered)

Gee, thanks. I usually don't get

recognized without my horn.

BURKE

Burke Bennett.    I represent kid

show talent.

21.

BURKE

Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain't in

the business to make you rich.

He's in it to make Frank Stokes

rich. That's how these network

goons operate.

SHELDON

That's so sad. Is it just me, or

is that sad?

BURKE

You know, years ago, a client of

mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a

problem...

SHELDON

Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble?

BURKE

Yeah, before the asshole found

religion. Anyway, Stokes was

trying to screw my boy out of some

merchandising points. Claimed he

had a warehouse full of Dicky

dolls that weren't moving. Now

Frank and I are old friends, so I

say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me

the warehouse' -- see, I know the

fucking warehouse is in the Bronx,

and I know it's emptier than my

wife's head.

(chuckles)

To make a long story short, I walk

out with a check for a hundred

grand and Stokes is sitting there

with his thumb up his ass.

SHELDON

That's very amusing, but I don't

care about Smoochy dolls and

Smoochy floor wax... I just want

more creative input. This rhino

came from my womb. I bore him, I

nursed him, and dammit...

(CONTINUED)

22.

SHELDON

I should be the one who raises

him!

BURKE

Shel, it's all about the dough.

After you get the money, you get

the power. And after you get the

power, you can have Smoochy walk

on stage with a hard-on if you

want.

SHELDON

It's funny, that never crossed my

mind.

BURKE

Unfortunately, until then...

you're just another puppet in the

prop room.

BURKE

Give me a call when you're ready,

kid. I'll cut the strings and

open the magic door for you.

RANDOLPH

I saw you! I saw you in there...

at my table... talking to him.

BURKE

Yeah, so what do you want?    A

parade?

RANDOLPH

You're my agent! Or did you

forget that?

(CONTINUED)

23.

BURKE

Not anymore, pal. You're a

cigarette butt. Go lay in the

gutter.

RANDOLPH

Ah! They're beautiful! A perfect

batch of cock cookies for a very

special rhino.

RANDOLPH

Oh yes, you're going to learn

about shame, my dear Smoochy.   And

I'm your professor.

SHELDON

Excuse me, Nora. Why was the

'Please and Thank You Song' cut?

NORA

Because it's sappy and it takes

away from the 'Cookie Song.'

(CONTINUED)

24.

SHELDON

Takes away? It enhances it! The

cookie song is a meaningless piece

of fluff without the 'Please and

Thank You' coda! That's the moral

anchor! That's where the lesson

is! You can't sell the sizzle

without the steak!

NORA

It's cut. And I want the 'Cookie

Song' lyrics changed back to the

way they were originally scripted.

SHELDON

I can't do that. I will not

condone children consuming endless

amounts of refined sugar. I have

to look myself in the mirror every

morning.

NORA

This is network television, not a

sprout farm. We're here to sell

sugar and plastic. That's what

keeps the lights on.

SHELDON

You're treating me like a puppet.

You know that? Well, guess

what? I am not your puppet.

NORA

Since when? Now get your spongy

orange ass out there and dance

for the cameras.

SHELDON

We have different eyes, Nora.

When I go out there I see kids.

You see wallets with pigtails.

25.

RANDOLPH

Bon soir, la Smoochy.   Welcome to

fatty Arbuckle-land.

RANDOLPH

(softly to himself)

Don't worry, little ones. Rainbow

Randolph will return...

(with rising anger)

After these messages!

SMOOCHY

Boy, all that jiggyin' and

ziggyin' sure makes a fella

hungry! Now if only I had my

super duper, super secret, super

special...

KIDS

Magic Cookie Bag!

(CONTINUED)

26.

SMOOCHY

Right-o-riffic!

(looks skyward)

Magic Cookie Bag, I command thee!

Come to your lord and master!

SMOOCHY

(singing)

'Lookie, lookie, lookie, here

comes the cookies! Fresh and

organic, no need to panic! Right

from the soil, no tropical oils!

Sweetened with juice, for an

energy boost! Fiber galore,

you'll be askin' for more...'

SMOOCHY

Oooh... just the smell of

unprocessed flour makes my tummy

do somersaults!

RANDOLPH

(under his breath)

Whatever that means, you fucking

retard.

(CONTINUED)

27.

RANDOLPH

Give 'em a cookie... give 'em a

cookie...

SMOOCHY

Wow! Look at this cookie, kids!

A rocket ship!

SHELDON

What a special day with such

special cookies!

SHELDON

Rrrrrrrr! Look at me, kids! I'm

flying to the moon! I'm flying to

Mars! I'm flying to --

(CONTINUED)

28.

RANDOLPH

Are you fucking blind?! It's a

cock! Not a space ship! Cock!

Cock!

SHELDON

Thank you all for coming. I just

wanted to iron out a few wrinkles

I feel we're having in the

communication department. No

finger-pointing. Lord knows when

you start pointing fingers,

someone gets poked in the eye.

SHELDON

Anyhoo, I'd like to turn the floor

over to my new agent, Mr. Burke

Bennett. So... heeeeeere's Burke!

BURKE

As you can imagine, my client has

many concerns, not the least of

which is studio security, but we

can address that later.

(CONTINUED)

29.

BURKE

See this guy, Frank? Take a good

long look, 'cause this prick saved

your life. Without him you'd be

sitting in Kaplan's right now,

sucking club soda through a paper

straw.

(to Nora)

And, you -- you'd be organizing

puppet shows for the brats at

P.S. 86. Excuse me, honey.

NORA

There's no excuse for you.

SHELDON

Man, I love club soda.

STOKES

We've always managed to come to

some sort of arrangement, Burke.

Why the fireworks?

BURKE

'Cause I'm holding all the

gunpowder. I represent the man

who created, owns, and controls

every square inch of Smoochy the

Rhino.

BURKE

God created Adam and what did he

get? A fucking dud. My guy? He

breathed life into a winner. And

anyone who does a better job than

God is gonna have a price.

SHELDON

Burke, of course, is in no way

comparing me to God.

BURKE

Yes I am.

(CONTINUED)

30.

NORA

You seem to forget that we went

out and found 'your guy.' Dug up

his corpse. Handed him his own

show when he couldn't sell his

face to a photo booth.

SHELDON

To be fair, Nora, I was booked to

open a car wash in Montauk.

BURKE

Oh, so you were doing him a favor?

(chuckles)

Allow me to untangle this web of

shit! I don't care what his

resume was, I don't care where you

found him, I don't care if his

last job was juggling apples for a

hut full of Pygmies on the

outskirts of the Congo... the fact

is, he fits a bill and you need

him. Like a hungry baby needs a

big tit. And that, my friends, is

why you're in a box with no

ventilation. And that is why the

rhino is going to get what

he deserves.

STOKES

What is that, exactly?

BURKE

Heaven, hell, and everything in

between.

(CONTINUED)

31.

BURKE

To the star and new executive

producer of the Smoochy show! May

your reign be a long and healthy

one!

SHELDON

I'm still in shock. Complete

creative control, part ownership

of the show, discretion over

merchandising and a dressing room

with a toilet! Am I dreaming or

what?

BURKE

And don't forget the corporate

penthouse. It took me six years

to get that for Randolph.

SHELDON

Boy, imagine... me, living in a

penthouse. Who'd a thunk it.

BURKE

It's called the high life, kid.

Get used to it. Pretty soon

you'll be burnin' one hundred

dollar bills just to see

Franklin break a sweat.

SHELDON

Jeez, I hope not. I have a deep

respect for money. Not to mention

Ben Franklin who had some

remarkable achievements in his

lifetime.

SHELDON

What's this?

BURKE

That's your graduation present.

Something you're gonna need now.

(CONTINUED)

32.

BURKE

Think of it as a tool of the

trade.

SHELDON

I've never owned a gun, I've never

touched a gun, and I don't believe

in guns. When I played cowboys

and Indians as a kid, I was always

the Chinese railroad worker.

BURKE

Trust me, Shel. It's a handy

accessory in this business. Even

if you don't load it, have it for

show. Sometimes that's all you

need. Especially with a creep

like Randolph lurking around.

SPINNER

Hiya, Smoochy! I'm Spinner!

Spinner!

SHELDON

Hi there.

SPINNER

I'm so excited to meet you!    I'm

Spinner!

SHELDON

(remembers)

Oh... right. I saw you fight on

TV once. I think it was your

farewell bout.

SWISH PAN TO:

(CONTINUED)

33.

RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #1

Tonight marks Spinner Dunn's final

appearance in the ring. What a

pleasure it's been to watch him

proudly march into the record books

for taking more blows to the head

than any fighter in history.

RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #2

Scrambled a bit? Sure. You don't

retire with a record of 81-59 and

wind up the Governor. But on the

upside, he's got the disposition

of a collie.

SWISH PAN TO:

SPINNER

You know what I love, Smoochy? I

love when you do the Jiggy Ziggy

dance! You know, the one you do

during 'Silly Time?'

SHELDON

You bet.     That's a big one.

SPINNER

Wanna see me do it?

SHELDON

Well, I don't know why if there's

enough room here to...

BURKE

Okay, champ, don't get overheated.

(CONTINUED)

34.

SPINNER

I love you.

SHELDON

I... uh... love you, too, Spinner.

TOMMY

Spinner, come over and meet the

Senator!

SHELDON

He seems pretty popular. It must

take real talent to run a place

like this.

BURKE

Spinner? The guy couldn't run a

water faucet. He's just a mascot.

It's his cousins, a bunch of Irish

mob boys, who really run the

joint.

SPINNER

(loudly)

Don't go anywhere, Smoochy! I'll

be right back after I take a dump!

BURKE

I think you made a new friend,

kid.

35.

ANGELO

Yeah, who is it?

RANDOLPH (O.S.)

(friendly)

Open up, buddy! It's me,

Randolph! It's been a long time!

ANGELO

Randy?

RANDOLPH

You fucking traitor! My body's

barely cold and already you work

for the rhino?

ANGELO

I don't know what you're talking

about.

RANDOLPH

Don't lie to me! I heard all about

it! You strapped that horn on

faster than a cheerleader gets the

clap!

ANGELO

I gotta eat, don't I?

RANDOLPH

You're a Krinkle Kid!   Not a

Smooch-bag! Say it!

ANGELO

Rhinette!

(CONTINUED)

36.

RANDOLPH

Say it: I am a Krinkle Kid! Say

it, before God! On the soul of

Jesus Christ! Say what you are!

ANGELO

I'm a Rhinette. Got that? The

Krinkle Kids are ten feet under.

With you.

RANDOLPH

(blubbering)

I missed you so much. Can I stay

here? I got no place to go.

RANDOLPH

... They kicked me out of the

corporate penthouse. Big

surprise. Sons-a-bitches. That's

how I got this beauty.

RANDOLPH

And of course, there's this...

RANDOLPH

That happened after my little

visit to the studio the other day.

Network security. Fucking savages.

(CONTINUED)

37.

RANDOLPH

I got liens, back taxes, lawyer's

bills, threats against my life...

I basically got the whole fucking

world up my ass. It's okay, I got

a loooong memory, son.

(Amos and Andy dialect)

What dey sow, dey gonna reap.

ANGELO

Stop doing this to yourself!

ANGELO

Wise up! You hear me? Don't piss

your life away like this.

RANDOLPH

(half-conscious)

It's the rhino, Angie. He's been

sent by the devil. Sent from hell

to destroy me. Smoochy... is the

face of evil.

38.

SHELDON

Whenever you get a chance... I

just need a second.

NORA

(into the phone)

Listen, can I call you back?

Yeah, some asshole's screaming in

my ear. Thanks.

SHELDON

I'm sorry, you didn't have to hang

up.

NORA

If I didn't you'd still be here.

SHELDON

But I am still here.

NORA

I'm hoping to correct that.

SHELDON

Nora, I want us to start off on

the right foot. I want you to

know that I value your input and I

don't want you to feel intimidated

just because the power structure

has changed a bit. I consider you

a partner.

NORA

Great. That'll come in handy if

we're ever at a square dance.

SHELDON

Well, I was never much of the

do- se-do type, but what I would

love to do is take you out to lunch

one day. You know, just two

colleagues chewing the fat...

forming a mutual respect...

planting the seeds of

cooperation...

(CONTINUED)

39.

NORA

No.

SHELDON

Fair enough. If you change your

mind --

NORA

I won't.

SHELDON

Okay then, I'll be in my office if

you need me. If you want to

brainstorm about anything. Ideas

and so forth.

SHELDON

Ficus?

SHELDON

Wow...

TOMMY (O.S.)

My cousin Spinner's take quite a

shine to you.

TOMMY

Ever since you came in the

restaurant. He can't stop yakkin'.

(CONTINUED)

40.

SHELDON

Well, he's a very nice man. Very

sweet disposition for someone that

size.

TOMMY

So, I was wondering if maybe you

could give him a little floor

space.

SHELDON

I'm sorry?

TOMMY

You know, a little part on the

show. You're the executive

producer now. You call the shots,

right?

SHELDON

Uh, that's a very sweet offer, and

I love Spinner, but TV is a

complicated medium and... I mean,

that would be like me getting into

the ring with a prizefighter.

(laughs)

Can you imagine such a thing?

Boom. K.O.! What's the alphabet,

Mommy?

TOMMY

This makes me sad.    Very, very,

sad.

DANNY

What's wrong, Tommy?

TOMMY

Nothing.     I'm just very sad right

now.

SAMMY

Who made you sad, Tommy?

TOMMY

I don't want to mention names.

(CONTINUED)

41.

SHELDON

You know what? Maybe I can find

Spinner a little something to do

on the show. That's probably the

best solution.

TOMMY

You're a good boy, Mopes. Don't

think we don't remember favors.

SWISH PAN TO:

SHELDON

Look, I appreciate the visit, but

I'm just putting together a little

petting zoo segment. Nothing

fancy -- a few kittens... maybe a

duck...

LOCAL 358

SONNY

If you're looking to bring in that

many pieces I gotta put a crew

together. Plus, we're lookin' at

transpo, a few leash handlers, a

cleanup boy and a doper to keep

the inventory quiet.

SHELDON

Jeez, this all sounds awfully

elaborate. I might have to forgo

the union and just borrow a few

animals from a pet shop.

SONNY

I wouldn't recommend it. Miss

Carol from Romper Room tried that

once and she's still limping.

42.

BEN

On behalf of FunZone Toys, I'd

like to congratulate you on your

recent promotion, and present you

with a small gift.

SHELDON

Uh... that's nice of you, Ben, but

a card would have been fine.

BEN

FunZone Toys would very much like

the Smoochy contract, Mr. Mopes.

SHELDON

Is this... I mean... are you

offering me a bribe or something?

BEN

FunZone Toys would very much like

the Smoochy contract, Mr. Mopes.

SHELDON

Normally, sir, we take the trash

out at the end of the day, but I

think I'll make an exception in

your case.

SHELDON

Yes?

ASSISTANT (V.O.)

A Mr. Feedlepepper on line two.

SHELDON

Who?

ASSISTANT (V.O.)

He says he's an old friend.

(CONTINUED)

43.

SHELDON

Hello?

RANDOLPH (V.O.)

You better grow eyes on the back

of your fucking head, you horned

piece of shit! I won't sleep

until the worms are crawlin' up

your foam rubber ass! I'm going

on safari, motherfucker... safari!

NORA

Congratulations on your little ice

show.

SHELDON

What are you talking about?

NORA

It didn't take you long to sell out,

did it?

NORA

What happened to your precious

integrity? Or was that just part

of your dog and pony act.

CUT TO:

44.

SHELDON

Burke, I never agreed to do an ice

show.

BURKE

Shel, do you know what kind of

cash we'll take in between the

gate and concessions? A venture

like this gets you money and

muscle. Times twenty.

SHELDON

Ice shows represent everything I'm

against. They're mindless

spectacles whose main purpose is

to sell overpriced sugar-water and

cheap plastic toys that splinter

in a kid's mouth on the ride home.

BURKE

Look, I know you got this fetish

for ethics, but now's not the time

to fly that kite. No one's ever

refused a shot at an ice show.

SHELDON

Until now. Smoochy doesn't sell

out, Burke. You should be proud

of that. Proud that you represent

a client who paves driveways, not

paints them over.

BURKE

I'm thrilled, Shel. Knocked out.

SHELDON

I'll have a pineapple juice,

Sandy.

(CONTINUED)

45.

SANDY

Pineapple? What happened to

orange juice?

SHELDON

I'm feeling feisty tonight.

SMOOCHY

Boy, wasn't that fun? In an

awkward kind of way? Anyhoo, how

'bout a big round of applause for

the newest member of the

Smoochyland Band... former

heavyweight contender, Spinner

Dunn!

SPINNER

Shit.   Sorry.

SPINNER

Did I do good, Sheldon, huh?   Did I

do good?

(CONTINUED)

46.

SHELDON

Yeah, that was great, Spinner.

Just watch your elbow next time.

Pinky's probably gonna lose that

tooth.

SPINNER

Okey doke.   I'm gonna go get drunk

now.

NORA

Nice job. Casting the show with

mental patients, I like that.

SHELDON

(snapping)

He is not a mental patient. He's

an ex-boxer and nightclub owner

who happens to have the sweet

innocent brian of a five-year-old!

NORA

Excuse me for not making the

distinction.

MERV

Hi there.

SHELDON

Hi.

MERV

Get in.

SHELDON

Thanks anyway, but I'm going

uptown.

(CONTINUED)

47.

MERV

Humor me, rhino.

MERV

Merv Green, Sheldon. It's a

pleasure to meet you.

SHELDON

If you're hoping for an autograph,

the gun's a bit much. The whole

'catch more flies with honey'

thing -- it really holds water.

MERV

Sheldon, I represent the Parade of

Hope Foundation. Maybe you've

heard of us.

SHELDON

You raise money to build

children's hospitals, right?

MERV

We've been known to add a brick or

two, sure.

MERV

Sheldon, let me get right to the

point -- there's talk on the

street that you're pulling out of

the ice show. Is that true?

(CONTINUED)

48.

SHELDON

(big sigh)

You know, I never agreed to an

ice show, nor would I ever agree

to do an ice show, and let me add

that none of this is your concern,

sir.

(shakes his head)

Sheesh.

MERV

Listen carefully, son: Parade of

Hope has sponsored every Kidnet

ice show since 1964. We take a

piece off the top and everybody

walks away happy. So let's not

buck history.

SHELDON

Well, I appreciate the offer, but

for the gazillionth time, I'm not

doing an ice show, so we have

nothing to discuss. Now, if

you'll just pull over, I'll get

out and we'll say our toodley-dos.

(to driver)

Far corner, please.

MERV

Allow me to be less murky.

Starting tomorrow, Smoochy the

Rhino raises his baton for Parade

of Hope. Benefits, banquets,

fund-raisers, I want it all.

(to driver)

Pull over, Terry.

MERV

And as far as the ice show goes...

I recommend you start shopping

for skates.

49.

SHELDON

This is unacceptable, Burke!    I'm

calling the authorities.

BURKE (V.O.)

Don't do it, Shel. You rat on

Parade of Hope and you'll be lucky

if they find your toenails. These

guys are the roughest of all the

charities.

SHELDON

I was threatened by an

organization that's supposed to

help children! What kind of world

is this?

BURKE (V.O.)

The real one. My advice?

Consider the ice show and stay

healthy.

NORA

May I come in?

SHELDON

Sure.

SHELDON

Uh... are you okay?

NORA

I'm getting drunk and I'm not used

to it.

SHELDON

Oh. Well, not to make you feel

worse, but with alcohol you're

also consuming empty calories.

(CONTINUED)

50.

NORA

It's just that... I want to

apologize, actually. And on those

rare occasions when I feel the

need to apologize for something,

it helps if I'm, you know... shit-

faced.

SHELDON

Wow.   I'm honored.

SHELDON

Why don't we get some air?

NORA

I... I may have been a little

harsh when we spoke the other day.

A little out of line.

SHELDON

Well, it wasn't as bad as the week

before when you called me a pasty-

faced, no-talent hack.

NORA

Yes, that was probably insensitive

as well.

(looks at him)

I heard you're not doing the ice

show. I find that... incredibly

admirable. Why didn't you tell

me?

SHELDON

I guess I didn't want to spoil

your fun. You look so content

when you're berating me.

NORA

I'm afraid I have become a bit

hardened over the years.

Sincerity's an easy disguise in

this business. It's hard to know

who's on the level.

(CONTINUED)

51.

SHELDON

Believe me, I'm learning that more

and more every day.

(wistfully)

'Sometimes light is really dark,

Sometimes crows can sing like

larks

Sometimes Winter feels like

Spring,

Don't think you know everything.'

NORA

(in disbelief)

'Rickets the Hippo'?

SHELDON

You remember Rickets?

NORA

That was my favorite show when I

was a kid. Rickets was the one

face I knew I could trust.

SHELDON

That's how I felt! Rickets had

real depth. He was my inspiration

for Smoochy.

NORA

Really? He was my inspiration to

work in children's television.

SHELDON

I can't believe it. I never met

anyone who even remembers Rickets.

Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky

dance?

NORA

Remember it?   I did it at my first

communion.

SHELDON

I'm sorry. That was a mistake,

right? I didn't mean for that to

hap--

(CONTINUED)

52.

NORA

(as they kiss)

You're not full of shit like all

the others, are you?

SHELDON

No, no.

NORA

(as they kiss)

You're for real, right?

SHELDON

Yes, yes.

NORA

(through the kisses)

I mean, I couldn't tell... First I

thought it was an act... and then

I just thought you were a simp or

something...

SHELDON

Shhh... you don't have to

explain...

NORA

I should go.

SHELDON

Why?

SHELDON

What's wrong? Is it the whiskey?

If you have to throw up, be my

guest. Anywhere you like.

NORA

It's just getting late.

NORA

Better get that.    Good night.

(CONTINUED)

53.

SHELDON

Hello?

RANDOLPH

Hello, Mr. Mopes? My name is

Benjamin Kunklepeck and I'm

calling on behalf of 'Parents for

Decency in Children's Television,'

perhaps you've heard of us?

SHELDON

No, but I like where you're coming

from. It's an issue very close to

my heart. Why just yesterday I

was commenting --

RANDOLPH

Sir, we're having a banquet

tomorrow and we'd be honored to

have you perform for us. We would

also like to present you with a

plaque for your ongoing commitment

to children's television. The

presenter will be a young orphan

with mild asthma. Can you attend?

SHELDON (V.O.)

Thanks for picking me up, Mr.

Kunklepeck. It's very nice of

you.

(CONTINUED)

54.

RANDOLPH

Don't be silly. The chance to

have Smoochy the Rhino perform at

our little soiree? I'd carry you

piggy-back through a bed of hot

rusty glass if I had to.

SHELDON

Well, it's always a pleasure to

help out a worthy cause. And

believe me, I've learned lately

that it's not all sunshine and

daffodils in the land of non-

profit.

RANDOLPH

I just looove your show, by the

way. It's such a refreshing

change of pace from that dreadful

embezzler... what's his name

again? Rainbow something or

other?

SHELDON

Randolph.

RANDOLPH

Yes. Rainbow Randolph. What a

scoundrel! He's probably gay too.

SHELDON

Oh, I don't know. I feel sorry

for him, actually. He obviously

has problems or issues that he

needs to sort out.

RANDOLPH

(getting frustrated)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't you

take particular glee in that you

basically stole his time slot?

Helped shovel dirt onto his

miserable corpse, as it were?

SHELDON

No, I would never take pleasure in

someone's downfall. You know the

old expression about walking a

mile in another man's shoes?

Well, that really holds water.

Just try to imagine --

(CONTINUED)

55.

RANDOLPH

(snapping)

Come on, he's a fucking asshole!

You hate him! Admit it!

SHELDON

(uncomfortable)

Uh... can we listen to the radio?

RANDOLPH

Okay, they're ready for you!

SHELDON

I gotta say, this is a first -- I

never performed in a tractor parts

warehouse before.

RANDOLPH

Well, we like to do these things

no-frills. It's all about the

kids.

SHELDON

Amen to that.

VOICE (O.S.)

It gives me great pleasure to

introduce our very special

guest... a supporter of the cause

and a friend to the brotherhood.

Please welcome, the one, the

only... Smoochy the Rhino!

Knock 'em dead, kid!

NORA

We have nothing to talk about.

SHELDON

Don't tell me you believe what

they're saying!

NORA

I don't have to believe anyone.

The picture in the paper said it

all. No one forced you to perform

at that rally.

SHELDON

Perform?     I barely sang one song.

NORA

Well maybe next time you'll do

a longer set.

SHELDON

Nora, I had no idea that was a

Nazi function. None whatsoever!

NORA

Funny, you'd think the fifty-foot

swastika you were standing in

front of might've given you a

hint.

SHELDON

The papers are blowing that out of

proportion. It was nowhere near

that big.

NORA

Look, the fact of the matter is, I

don't know you, okay? Not really.

So don't expect me to go out on an

emotional limb here.

SHELDON

But what about the balcony? What

about the Klunky-Wunky dance?

NORA

I was drunk.    Don't read too much

into it.

You mean like this?

STOKES

Oh my.   And what is this on my

CHICK

Two hundred grand in a Louis

a million. And you can keep the

luggage.

You're dealing with an honorable

play ball.

STOKES

Gentlemen, I suddenly feel

RANDOLPH

Hiya, cutie!

RANDOLPH

So here's the good news: Yes,

I'll be happy to end my sabbatical

and return to my old slot. I know

you and Frank are in a bind, so

I'll start Monday. Call wardrobe,

call props, tell 'em the R man is

back and he's ready to start

whistlin' dem happy tunes for da

little chillens.

RANDOLPH

Ahhh. Who do ya gotta blow to get

a Scotch around here?

NORA

You've got three seconds to pry

your ass off my couch and get out.

RANDOLPH

Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone!

You need that slot filled and

I'm ready to reclaim what's

rightfully mine.

NORA

Just in case you forgot, you're a

criminal and a scumbag.

RANDOLPH

Okay, so maybe I commandeered a

stray shekel or two. Big deal!

Compared to what Smoochy did

that's like jerking off in the

supermarket.

NORA

Where do you shop?

RANDOLPH

Come on. Have you lost all

affection for me? After what we

once had?

(CONTINUED)

65.

NORA

That was a long time ago.    I was

young and stupid.

RANDOLPH

Why we broke up I'll never know.

NORA

You turned into an asshole and I

didn't love you.

RANDOLPH

We could've worked through all

that.

RANDOLPH

Damn it, Nora! The public is

clamoring for me! I'm a fucking

patriot! Mopes is a Nazi! He's

evil! He's probably even gay!

You should've seen the way he was

checking me out in the car!

NORA

(suddenly suspicious)

What does that mean?

RANDOLPH

What does what mean?

NORA

You said he was checking you out

in the car. What car?

RANDOLPH

No... it's just a vibe! A Nazi

homosexual vibe! It emanates from

the television! The whole Smoochy

costume... with the erect horn...

I mean, what's that all about?

NORA

You're talking awfully fast,

Randolph.

RANDOLPH

I still love you!   Let's go on a

date!

NORA

Were you at that rally? Tell me!

Did you have something to do with

NORA

Did you set Sheldon up?

accusations. Bitch, bitch,

bitch...

What's wrong, kid? The mayor of

Patterson's here with his wife.

They wanna meet ya.

I don't wanna meet no one. I miss

What about Ms. Bishop's charge that

That's right, Tara. Smoochy's

(notices cheese curls)

Look at this place!

ANGELO

That's it! I want you out of

here!

RANDOLPH

(suddenly scared)

Where am I supposed to go?

ANGELO

I don't care!

(pointing to door)

Out!!

SHELDON

Easy, Spinner. Watch the ribs,

buddy.

(CONTINUED)

73.

SPINNER

I missed you so much!

SHELDON

I missed you too, champ.

SPINNER

I've been practicing and

practicing and I got real good,

Sheldon. Real good!

SPINNER

Wanna see me march?

SHELDON

Sure, why not.

BURKE

So you were saying you had some

good news?

SHELDON

Yes. Some very good news. After

giving it a lot of thought... I've

decided to do the ice show.

BURKE

Finally! I got me a bar mitzvah

boy. Today you are a man!

SHELDON

I realize now it's a sin to waste

your power.

BURKE

Like they say, rock bottom's a

college education.

(CONTINUED)

74.

SHELDON

But here's the really good news:

I'm doing it myself. No sponsors,

no vendors, no crooks. Not one

dirty hand will touch this. Not

one person will make a dollar off

these kids. Smoochy on Ice will

be a study in purity.

SHELDON

As far as food concessions go,

I'll supply the refreshments. For

free. Low sodium, whole wheat

pretzels and apple slices. Healthy

stuff. Now are you ready for the

best part?

BURKE

I'm holding my breath.

SHELDON

All profits from ticket sales will

be used to built a state-of-the-

art methadone clinic in Coney

Island.

SHELDON

I'm not just talking a run-of-the-

mill clinic... I'm going to build

a methadone palace. A place where

men and women can withdraw in

luxury.

BURKE

Sheldon, you can't do an ice show

and cut out the vendors. And more

importantly, you can't cut out the

Parade of Hope. It's suicide.

SHELDON

You always told me, when you've

got muscles you make the rules.

Well, I'm feeling pretty strong

right now.

(CONTINUED)

75.

SHELDON

All this time I was letting the

business use me. Well, I think it's

time I start using the business.

I've got my clout back and I'm not

gonna waste it this time. Take care

of it, Burke.

TOMMY

Shel, you gotta help me out. He

bangs that goddamn thing from

morning till night. I got a

headache that goes from my eyes to

my ass.

SHELDON

Whatever I can do, Tommy, just say

it. You know I love Spinner. And

I owe you.

TOMMY

Give the boy something else to do on

the show. Anything. Just as long

as it don't clang, chime or honk.

CHICK

I don't like complications, Frank.

You got one week to get Takashi that

slot or you're gonna be shakin'

hands with Buddha.

STOKES

Don't you understand? My hands are

tied. The rhino's been exonerated.

The show's more popular than ever.

(CONTINUED)

76.

CHICK

(to Sambo and Tobi)

Okay, boys, chop him up, bag him

and dump him in the woods.

STOKES

All right! I'll take care of it!

I just need time!

CHICK

One week, Jeeves. Got that? Or

I get a blender and make an Orange

Julius with your feet.

MAN

Save the rhino! Before it's too

late! Make a donation! Save the

rhino!

(to Randolph)

Hey, mister, ya wanna help save

the rhino?

RANDOLPH

I'm the one who needs to be saved!

Me. I'm broke! I lost my lawyer!

My only friend kicked me out! I'm

a fucking peanut shell in the

shape of a man! Save the

Rainbow! Save the Rainbow!

Save the Rainbow!

MAN

Help!   Someone call a cop!

77.

STOKES

Your client is suffocating me. To

make matters worse, he's caused me

to veer into a hazardous situation.

A situation that otherwise could

have a very happy ending.

BURKE

Tell me more about the Asians.

STOKES

They're ruthless. Unwavering.

Unprincipled. And best of all,

they know how the game is played.

They respect our delicate

ecosystem of mutual benefit.

STOKES

I'd bring you in on this, Burke.

You'd be my partner on the Takashi

deal. Split down the middle. We

have an opportunity to get back on

track here. Back to the way it

was.

BURKE

The good old days.

STOKES

Pre-rhinoceros.

BURKE

This is very sticky ground we're

about to walk on.

STOKES

Well, you're used to a little

glue on your shoes.

BURKE

Let me poke around. Sift through

the possibilities.

78.

MERV

This is what happens to guys who

keep secrets, Johnny.

JOHNNY

I'll give you the rest next week!

I promise!

MERV

It's not me you're fucking over,

it's sick kids. You got something

against sick kids, Johnny?

JOHNNY

No!   I love sick kids!

MERV

And you tell that fat producer of

yours, if he ever gives me a low

head count again, he'll lose the

other thumb.

BURKE

Merv Green. How's tricks, kid?

MERV

Well, if it ain't smilin' Burke.

Whose bones are you pickin' today?

BURKE

(chuckles)

You got a minute, pally?

79.

MERV

No one freezes me out of an ice

show. No one. I don't care how

many fucking clinics he's trying

to save.

BURKE

Look, I'm chokin' on the same bone

as you.

MERV

If you're trying to aggravate me,

you're doing a hell of a job.

BURKE

I'm not here to aggravate, just

educate. I think Mopes might be

talking to people he shouldn't be

talking to.

MERV

That's an ugly string of words.

BURKE

He's got it in his head that he's

gonna clean up the way we do

business.

(beat)

Truthfully? I wouldn't be

surprised if he's wearing a wire.

BURKE

Jesus, I got a thing across town.

BURKE

Let's keep talking, Merv. There's

oughta be some kind of solution.

Don't you think?

80.

RANDOLPH

Attention, New Yorkers! You are

about to hear a shocking story

of injustice!

RANDOLPH

I urge you to listen! It has a

surprise ending you won't want

to miss!

RANDOLPH

It's the story of a venomous rhino

and his aggressive campaign to

slander, vilify, defame, denigrate

and villainize my good name! But

one thing he can't do, is take my

life from me. No, friends, only I

have the power to do that!

RANDOLPH

This is what Smoochy has done to

me! He's brought me to this! I

can no longer live in a world

where the innocent suffer and

the wicked thrive!

RANDOLPH

Where is God??!!

(CONTINUED)

81.

RANDOLPH

I'm sorry to do this, people.

Don't try to talk me out of it.

MAN IN CROWD

Do it!   Light it!

RANDOLPH

Our guest of honor will be here

any moment! This is for his eyes!

For his conscience. He'll have to

live with this imagine for the

rest of his miserable life!

SMOOCHY

(to driver)

Take it from me, Lester. Use your

power. Don't squander it -- build

with it.

LESTER

Sound advice, Mr. Mopes. If I

ever get any power I'll give that

a whirl.

(notices crowd

up ahead)

Hey, what's going on up there?

SMOOCHY

(casually)

Looks like a street performer of

some sort.

(CONTINUED)

82.

RANDOLPH

This is it, folks! It's showtime!

I'm sorry to do this, but he's

left me no choice!

RANDOLPH

Shut up, you hillbilly assholes!

You're borough trash! Go back to

your huts across the river!

RANDOLPH

Fuck you! Fuck all you people! I

was the last of the Mohicans!

You'll never see another Rainbow

Randolph in this lifetime! You

had me and you blew it! All of

you!

RANDOLPH

This if for you, Smoochy!

Remember this! As long as you

live, remember this image! You

did this to me!

LITTLE GIRL

Whatcha doin', Rainbow Randolph?

CROWD

Smoochy!!!

(CONTINUED)

83.

RANDOLPH

What does it all mean??!!

SPINNER

What do you mean I can't play the

cowbell no more?

SHELDON

You're too talented for the

cowbell, Spinner. Cowbells are

for babies.

SPINNER

(a little angry)

I ain't no baby!

SHELDON

That's right. You're a fully

grown man. With whiskers... and

scars... the whole sha-bang.

That's why you deserve a bigger

role on the show. A more

important role...

84.

KIDS

'Stepdads are people too/ They

have bad days, like we all do/

Be patient and help them through/

Stepdads are people too...'

SMOOCHY

(singing)

... 'So three cheers for the man

that I proudly call Stan... He's

not quite a dad or a brother...

Yes, he gets cross, but still he's

the boss... And besides he takes

care of my mother!'

SMOOCHY

Remember, kids. First

impressions, good or bad, are not

always what they seem. Just like

a new puppy, new dads need to

adjust to their surroundings. So

give 'em time! But always

remember... if he becomes abusive

to you or Mommy... what are the

magic numbers?

KIDS IN BLEACHERS

(shouting in unison)

Nine-One-One!

SMOOCHY

Right-o-riffic!

SMOOCHY

And now, boys and girls, I have a

special surprise. I'd like to

introduce the newest member of the

Magic Jungle... my cousin...

Moochy the Rhino!

(CONTINUED)

85.

SMOOCHY

Howdy, Moochy! Welcome to the

Jungle! You wanna say howdy to

the kids?

SMOOCHY

Moochy?

SPINNER

My name is Moochy.

SMOOCHY

That's right. We've established

that.

SPINNER

(leaning into Sheldon)

Sheldon, this costume's makin' my

nuts itch.

SPINNER

That was fun! Was it bad when I

done that thing, where I tripped

and knocked over the Flamingo and

then he knocked over the cameraman

and then those lights fell down on

that lady's head?

(CONTINUED)

86.

SHELDON

It's fine, Spinner. We'll edit it

out. But tomorrow in rehearsal

we're gonna work on a new thing

called 'the importance of hitting

your mark.'

SPINNER

Great!    I get to hit something!

NORA

Hi.

SHELDON

Hi.

NORA

I read about the ice show.

SHELDON

Yeah, the papers seem to be really

covering it.

NORA

I think it's great. What you're

doing for that clinic.

SHELDON

Thanks.

NORA

I just need some clarification...

SHELDON

Don't worry. Spinner just needs

a little more rehearsal. I'll get

him there.

NORA

No I mean about us.

NORA

Ever since you've been back I just

feel like there's something that's

not connecting.

(CONTINUED)

87.

SHELDON

I guess I'm still readjusting a

little. Like a guy who's come

back from the war. Not that I'd

equate my misfortune with the

brave men and women who protect

us overseas.

NORA

I just thought we were on our way

to something... granted, my

mistaken belief that you had ties

to Neo-Nazis might have put a

damper on our relationship, but

I'm sorry for --

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey -- rhino.

(CONTINUED)

88.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

ANCHOR (V.O.)

Former heavyweight contender and

restaurateur Lawrence 'Spinner'

Dunn was found shot to death in a

rhinoceros outfit early this

morning in Chinatown. Dunn, a

frequent performer on 'Smoochy's

Magic Jungle,' was pronounced dead

at the scene. Police are

searching for --

MERV

How could you hit the wrong

rhino?!

(CONTINUED)

89.

HENRY

Who knew Smoochy had a cousin

Moochy? They look fucking

identical.

MERV

Smoochy is bright orange, Moochy

is burnt rust! Read the papers!

Do I gotta take you back to

fucking kindergarten?

MITCH

All you said was 'hit the rhino.'

You never specified the color.

I'm not taking the blame for this

one.

MERV

I'm not through with you yet,

rhino! Your time will fucking

come!

McCALL

Ellie, over here.

(CONTINUED)

90.

SHELDON

It's my fault. He'd still be

alive if it wasn't for me. He

would have been so proud to be in

the ice show.

NORA

There was nothing you could have

done. Don't torture yourself.

SHELDON

I'm sorry, Spinner.   I'm so sorry.

TOMMY

He really loved you, Shel. And

this I guarantee -- that fucking

Randolph has seen his last

rainbow. We're gonna find him,

cut off his balls, and shove 'em

up his ass.

SHELDON

Maybe you better leave it to the

police.

DANNY

They won't do the ball thing.

It's against procedure.

TOMMY

Don't forget -- that hit was meant

for you, Shel. So from now on,

everywhere you go, we go.

SHELDON

That's okay, Tommy.   I'll be fine.

TOMMY

Fine, nothin'. And as Christ is

my witness, no one's touchin' a

hair on your fuckin' head.

Spinner would have wanted it that

way.

(CONTINUED)

91.

TOMMY

(to the boys)

Alright, boys, let's get shit-

faced. For Spin.

SHELDON

Didn't Rickets the Hippo have a

song about death?

NORA

'The Last Nappy Time.' It gave me

a lot of comfort when my mother

died.

(sings quietly)

'When doggies stop barking

And fish cease to swim

And Grandpa lays silent, from his

head to his limbs

Sadness will find you

But soon you'll feel fine...'

SHELDON/NORA

'In life we all have

Our Last Nappy Time.'

RANDOLPH

I didn't do it! I know you're

still mad at me, but you gotta

believe me.

(CONTINUED)

92.

ANGELO (V.O.)

The papers say you were the

mastermind.

RANDOLPH

Mastermind? I can barely figure

out how to unzip my pants these

days. Just taking a piss is a

logistical nightmare.

ANGELO (V.O.)

I believe you, Randy. But you

can't come back to my place.

They'll find you. You gotta go

underground.

ANGELO

It's heatin' up out there. Every

cop in New York is looking for

you. And Tommy Cotter's boys are

combin' the streets. You're gonna

have to stay put for a while.

RANDOLPH

I was an altar boy once. Did you

know that? I wanted to be a

priest. Do you believe in angels,

Angie?

(CONTINUED)

93.

ANGELO

Angels?

RANDOLPH

There was a little angel in

pigtails. She was the only one

who cared about me. She saved my

life.

ANGELO

You didn't want to kill yourself,

Randy. You know that.

RANDOLPH

Perhaps it's time to heal. To

accept the fact that Smoochy has

won and gracefully march forward.

True, I'm currently wanted for a

murder I didn't commit. But I

have faith. Faith that justice

will prevail.

ANGELO

Now you're talkin', kid. This is

a big step... I'm proud of you.

RANDOLPH

Did you bring lunch?

ANGELO

Yes.

RANDOLPH

Chicken and stars?

ANGELO

Just like you asked for.

RANDOLPH

Can I have some, please?

ANGELO

For a smile.

ANGELO

Atta boy.

(CONTINUED)

94.

ANGELO

Here, I got you some crossword

puzzles and stuff to read.

ANGELO

You okay? Randy?

RANDOLPH

Motherfucker!!!!!!!

TOMMY

Big news, Shel.

SHELDON

What's that?

TOMMY

It wasn't Smiley who killed

Spinner. It was Parade of Hope.

NORA

Merv Green?

SHELDON

Are you sure? The cops have tons

of evidence on Randolph.

(CONTINUED)

95.

TOMMY

We did our own investigation.

Cousin Ian from down at the

morgue... you met him at the

wake...

IAN

See the neck? Snapped like a

twig. Animals... Parade of Hope's

calling card. When they do a guy,

they like to sign the tab.

TOMMY

What's that guy's name over there?

Green?

LEON

Yeah, Merv Green.

TOMMY

This was one time they shoulda

left the tab blank.

NORA

I knew Merv Green was a scumbag

from the day he grabbed my ass at

a 'Feed the Children' benefit.

SHELDON

Well, God help those guys now.

They're gonna get a first-class

ride through the criminal justice

system, and I'm buying the

tickets.

TOMMY

It's all taken care of, Shel.

SHELDON

What does that mean?

96.

MERV

It was a mistake! An honest

mistake! All I'm trying to do is

help children.

TOMMY

You like kids, huh?

MERV

Yes!   Of course!

TOMMY

So you must know a few fairy

tales. Danny, tell him the one

about the worthless prick who gets

his head chopped off.

MERV (O.S.)

No... no... no!

TOMMY

Now you know why charities go

under sometimes.

SHELDON

Do we really need to hear this?

I don't want to hear this.

JIMMY

A clean cut.

SHELDON

Okay, got it.

(CONTINUED)

97.

ROY

And then we took his head and --

SHELDON

Thank you! Specifics about his

head are superfluous at this

point.

VOICE (O.S.)

Where is he?

NORA

(attitude)

Can I help you with something?

CHICK

Yeah, honey, you can help us

with something...

CHICK

You tell that boss of yours he

better take care of the rhino

problem. In my culture we honor

deals or invite consequences.

NORA

I don't know what you're talking

about and your cologne's making

me nauseous. Other than that,

you're great company.

CHICK

Spicy little thing, isn't she?

(CONTINUED)

98.

CHICK

Takashi gets that time slot. You

hear me, girly? Tell that boss of

yours we'll kill everyone at this

fucking network if we have to.

Starting with the pretty ones.

CHICK

Auf Wiedersehen, honey.

NORA

It's Stokes. He's behind the

whole thing! He cut some kind of

deal for the Smoochy slot!

SHELDON

What are you talking about?

NORA

He wants you out so he can put

Takashi in!

SHELDON

Who's Takashi?

NORA

Jesus, Sheldon! Don't you ever

pick up a copy of International

Performer? He's the hottest kid

show host from Asia.

(CONTINUED)

99.

RANDOLPH

Ah! How very cozy. Like two logs

in a little bonfire. All we need

is a few sticks and some wienies.

RANDOLPH

I had her before you! Pachyderm!

I was in love with her! In love!

And you snatched her away! Like

a common thief! You're the bad

guy! Not me! He's the bad guy,

Nora. He's incapable of

understanding the love we once

had! Tender, yet passionate.

Old-fashioned, yet experimental.

(cackles)

Tell him about a few of our

experiments, Nora! Tell him!

SHELDON

(to Nora)

Is this true? Please tell me it's

just the confused ramblings of a

diseased mind.

SHELDON

Holy mother of Toledo. When

exactly were you planning to let

me know about this?!

NORA

(turns to Sheldon)

Listen, there was a time -- and

I'm not proud of this -- but there

was a time when I was a bit of

a... kiddie-host groupie.

RANDOLPH

You're just another action figure

for her collection!

NORA

That's not fair!

RANDOLPH

Tell him about Jingle Jackson!

(CONTINUED)

100.

SHELDON

You dated Jingle Jackson?

RANDOLPH

The bells turned her on. Hey,

tell him about Jumbo Johnny!

There's a tale for ya! A whale

of a tale!

SHELDON

Oh good Lord in Heaven.

NORA

Look, what I did before I met you

is none of your business.

RANDOLPH

Shut up!   Both of you! This is

my show!

RANDOLPH

Do you fully understand the power

of a condemned man? Do you? I'm

already wanted for one murder, why

should I give a flaming horse's

twat if I commit two more?

SHELDON

I... uh... read once that the best

way to diffuse a tense situation

is with a little humor. To that

end, would you like to hear a

funny joke?

RANDOLPH

(rolling his eyes)

Oh, please. Go blow yourself,

Martha.

(waves gun again)

Fix me a beverage, woman. Make me

one of those drinks that used to

make us all warm and fuzzy before

bouncy-bouncy time!

NORA

Fix it yourself, asshole.

(CONTINUED)

101.

RANDOLPH

(points to gun)

Remember, I have Mr. Boomy.

SHELDON

I'm telling you, you'd love this

joke. It revolves around Santa

Claus and the Easter Bunny getting

into a fender bender.

RANDOLPH

(to Sheldon)

You know, when I lived here I used

to have a big painting above the

fireplace. A naked chick holding

a pumpkin. It was very tasteful.

No bush...

NORA

Look, Randolph. We know it

wasn't you who killed Spinner.

SHELDON

We'll go to the police, first

thing tomorrow... straighten

everything out.

RANDOLPH

Oh!  Goody-goody gumdrops!

(to Nora)

Vodka straight up is fine, sugar

babe!

RANDOLPH

Did you put on a little weight,

honey? That's okay, you're still

a hot little brood mare. I bet

you miss the sweet sting of my

riding crop. Giddy up, pony!

(CONTINUED)

102.

RANDOLPH

(to tune of

'Ol' MacDonald)

'Rainbow Randolph is the man.

Yes he, yes he, is.

He's the Prez of Rainbowland.

Yes he, yes he, is.

With some fun, fun here, and a

laugh, laugh there.

Here a dance, there a song,

Everything is fun, fun.

Rainbow Randolph is the King, the

King of Rainbowland!'

SHELDON

Is this what you want? A Hansel

and Gretel ending?! You want to

be the big bad wolf?

RANDOLPH

Stop! It's too hot!    The heat!

It's driving me mad!

RANDOLPH

Go ahead, kill me! Finish me off.

My life's over anyway. Everything

I touch turns to shit. Put me out

of my misery.

SHELDON

You're not nothing. You're

bitter, misguided and I'm guessing

a raging alcoholic, but you're

still Rainbow Randolph. Despite

everything that's happened, you

once made children happy.

(CONTINUED)

103.

RANDOLPH

Would you be my friend?

SHELDON

Sure.

RANDOLPH

(to Nora)

You too?

NORA

I guess.

RANDOLPH

Sorry about the brood mare stuff.

RANDOLPH

(a pitiful child)

Thank you.

NORA

(re: gun)

What are you doing?

(CONTINUED)

104.

SHELDON

Just making the playing field

even. I'm tired of running this

race with one leg.

NORA

You're letting them drag you down

to their level.

RANDOLPH

(from couch)

She's right, Sheldon. Don't make

the same mistakes I did. Keep

your dignity intact.

RANDOLPH

Son-of-a-bitch!

SHELDON

I appreciate everyone's concern,

but I can take care of myself.

RANDOLPH

(mouthing to Nora)

I tried.

SHELDON

(to Randolph)

Okay, buddy, we have to get down

to the Garden. You're welcome to

stay here as long as you like.

Just don't leave until I get

things squared away.

RANDOLPH

Be careful, Sheldon. Remember

what I told you -- you've only

scratched the surface of this

scummy business. You have yet to

strike oil.

(CONTINUED)

105.

RANDOLPH

You're lucky to have a guy like

Smoochy.

NORA

You just rest, Randolph.

RANDOLPH

He's the real thing. Smoochy's the

real thing. And I've been a fraud.

A wicked man doing wicked acts.

SHELDON

Well, we all have our bad days.

STOKES

Things are getting out of hand.

We have to cover our tracks.

BURKE

Relax, everything's gonna work

out.

STOKES

Relax? They found Merv Green's

head on the Grand Concourse!

Excuse my concern.

BURKE

Look, we can cover all the tracks

we want, but in the end we still

got the same problem. We gotta

finish what we started.

STOKES

God help us...

(CONTINUED)

106.

BURKE

It'll all be over tonight.

Buggy's gonna take care of

everything.

STOKES

Buggy? Buggy Ding-Dong? The guy

who hosted 'Buggy's Bumpy

Railroad'?

STOKES

Yeah, until he discovered the joys

of Turkish black mule heroin. For

the right price he'll do anything.

It's amazing the guy's still alive.

STOKES

I don't know, Burke... this whole

thing...

BURKE

Speak of the devil. Have a seat,

Bug.

STOKES

(attempting to

sound cheerful)

Buggy. You're looking good.

BURKE

It's time we put this thing to

rest, Frank. And the way I see

it... the rhino's up past his

bedtime.

107.

RANDOLPH

(sing-songy)

Hellooo!

ANGELO

Randy, is that you?

(CONTINUED)

108.

RANDOLPH

Yes, Angelo, my little Twinkie,

shouldn't you be getting ready for

the big show?

ANGELO

Listen, Buggy's been here.

RANDOLPH

Buggy Double D's?   The Dong Man?

ANGELO

Yeah, he lifted my backstage pass

and he's braggin' that he's

doing some kind of job for Burke

Bennett.

RANDOLPH

Sheldon's in trouble.   I gotta get

down to the Garden.

ANGELO

The place is crawling with cops.

They'll jump on you like a

trampoline.

RANDOLPH

I don't care.

RANDOLPH

I have to warn the rhino.

109.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And now... it gives us great

pleasure to introduce America's

favorite rhino... ladies and

gentlemen... boys and girls...

(dramatic pause)

Heeeeere's Smoochy!

SMOOCHY

On behalf of myself, the

Rhinettes, and the soon to be

restored Coney Island Methadone

Center, I thank you all for

coming.

SMOOCHY

It was my original intention that

tonight's performance would be a

benign mix of Smoochy songs and

ice dancing. But as an artist, I

believe I must convey to you, my

fans, what I'm feeling at any

given moment in my life. To do

otherwise would be dishonest. Art

is communication. It's something

we learn and hopefully grow from.

With that in mind... I hope you

enjoy the show.

(CONTINUED)

110.

SHELDON

This is for Spinner.

MAN

It's Rainbow Randolph!   Someone

stop him!

RANDOLPH

Sheldon!!!

(CONTINUED)

113.

STOKES

(whispering to Burke)

What's he doing here?! He's going

to screw everything up!

NORA

(screaming)

Sheldon!!!

BURKE

Nora...

NORA

You're in on this, aren't you!

You sold him out! You fucking

snake!

STOKES

Nora, please. It's not what you

think. I'm grooming you. You're

going to run the division one

day...

STOKES

(frightened; to Burke)

What now? What do we do now?!

BURKE

Survival of the fittest!

114.

NORA

Sheldon!!! Get down!!!

(CONTINUED)

115.

RANDOLPH

Give me that gun, you fucking

wacked-out freak!

116.

COP #1

You okay?

RANDOLPH

I don't know. I'm kind of fucked

up in general, so it's hard to

gauge.

NORA

Burke's with Stokes.   He's been in

it all along.

NORA

No, Sheldon, don't!

117.

BURKE

You fucking point a gun at me? A

gun I gave you as a gift?! Where's

your fucking etiquette?

NORA

Let him go.

NORA

Now. Before I pump one in that

Grecian Formula scalp of yours.

BURKE

You know something, kid? You've

turned out to be an incredible

pain in the ass.

SHELDON

You were behind the Spinner hit,

weren't you?

(CONTINUED)

118.

BURKE

That was a tragic mistake.

(shakes head sadly)

If only one could turn back time...

(beat)

But what the hell, it's just one

less mick in the world.

NORA

You son-of-a-bitch.

BURKE

Oh my. What are you gonna do?

Kill me? That wouldn't be very

Smoochy-like behavior.

SHELDON

You're right. There's just one

thing...

SHELDON

I'm not Smoochy.

SHELDON

I finally realized we're living in

a different jungle.

NORA

No, Sheldon.

NORA

Sheldon!

VOICE (O.S.)

Don't do it, Shel.

(CONTINUED)

119.

SHELDON

(sternly)

Stay out of it, Tommy.   This is my

business.

TOMMY

No more killin', Shel. Enough's

enough. Don't destroy who you are

for this piece of shit. You mean

something to the kids. Don't take

Smoochy away from the kids.

SHELDON

I don't know how I got pushed this

far.

TOMMY

You're only human, Shel. The

important thing is... you never

went over the cliff. You're a

good boy. For some of us... it's

too late.

TOMMY

We'll take it from here, kid, you

run along with your girl. Get on

with your life.

SHELDON

Tommy, you're not going to --

TOMMY

Don't worry. Sometimes even a

rat deserves a little mercy.

NORA

Bus backfire.

120.

STOKES

Get out of here!

STOKES

Move this thing!

STOKES

Are you deaf?! I said --

CHICK

I wish I could tell you it'll be

quick and painless, Frank, but you

know how these things go...

SHELDON

You know, a little grime here and

there doesn't change the fact...

it's still a beautiful city.

(CONTINUED)

121.

NORA

Let's go home, Smoochy.    Show's

over.

SHELDON

No it's not. It's just beginning.

FADE OUT.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

And now... it gives us great

pleasure to introduce America's

favorite rhino... ladies and

gentlemen... boys and girls...

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

Heeeeeere's Smoochy!

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

With his partner and comrade...

the one, the only... Rainbow

Randolph!

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
