SERNA (V.O.)

Buzzy...Buzz...?

PADICHE (V.O.)

Yeah...Sid?

SERNA (V.O.)

You got clicks, anything?

PADICHE (V.O.)

Nah, nuthin' on my end--

SERNA (V.O.)

--Okay...hang on, I gotta move--

MESSNER

(keying mic)

Zoom and pan please.   Stay tight.

SERNA (V.O.)

Alright, now Buzzy-- this is, this

is it, here, okay, so listen to me

careful and wait till I'm finished

'cuz we got no room for slop.

PADICHE (V.O.)

I'm here.

2.

SERNA (V.O.)

PADICHE (V.O.)

SERNA (V.O.)

PADICHE (V.O.)

SERNA

PADICH (V.O.)

SERNA (V.O.)

(feedback distorts)

PADICHE

SERNA (V.O.)

PADICHE (V.O.)

3.

SERNA (V.O.)

Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline,

yet and before I get to it, one more

thing I heard, little curious, should

probably bring it up...Primo wants

Israel's heart. The actual thing,

the organ.

PADICHE (V.O.)

...Jesus...what for?

SERNA (V.O.)

--who can say. He's off his onion,

y'know, he's old school Sicilian,

this is how they hate.

PADICHE   (V.O.)

Wow.

SERNA (V.O.)

Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm

back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out

m'self, no extra charge. My thing

is, we crew up, let's not fuck

around, someone's cousin, some Zip

off the boat from Naples, let's get

pros, people who know how to behave.

PADICHE (V.O.)

Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm

thinking might be good for this.

SERNA (V.O.)

Chances are, they're gonna get into

some shit too, hafta put people down.

PADICHE (V.O.)

That's not a problem. Are we goin'

outta pocket ourselves?

SERNA

Yeah, I can front this.

PADICHE (V.O.)

Well just so I got a quote in my

head. What's the rate for the Swede?

SERNA

That's the punchline, y'ready?

PADICHE

Shoot.

4.

SERNA (V.O.)

A million flat.

PADICHE (V.O.)

No shit.

SERNA (V.O.)

None whatsoever.

SMASH CUT TO:

DUPREE (V.O.)

Buddy Israel, nicknamed "Aces" Born

a bastard, mom Laverne chased the

pipe dream from a Dairy Queen in

Kansas City to the Vegas stage. Two

months after stepping off a Greyhound,

she gets knocked up by some hood.

CUT TO SCENE:

DUPREE (V.O.)

Biological abandons her and the

showgirl thing goes sideways so she

winds up working as a magician's

assistant to make extra cash.

CUT TO:

5.

DUPREE

...And young Buddy learns everything

about cards from this Mandrake

motherfucker his mom is working for...

CUT TO SCENE:

DUPREE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

But magic man was also a degenerate

gambler and got caught dealing bottom-

deck at a mob-owned poker parlor.

(beat)

He didn't get outta there with much

more than a pulse.

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO SCENE:

DUPREE

Point is, he passed on all this slight

of hand shit onto Aces and the kid

is sick with it...By the age of twelve

Buddy Israel is positively prodigal

with a deck of cards. By sixteen,

he's headlining the MGM's main room.

CUT TO SCENE:

CUT BACK TO:

6.

DUPREE

This punk is pulling down ten bills

a night and more showgirl geech than

you can shake a stick at. Four years

of sold-out shows, he becomes the

unofficial mob mascot

CUT TO SCENE:

DUPREE (cont'd; V.O.) (CONT'D)

By the tender age of twenty-one he's

breaking bread with the wheels,

keeping company with major muscle.

And it goes to his head in a big way

CUT TO SCENE:

DUPREE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

...Wiseguys start to think this

sonofabitch is a mystic, something

special...and Aces plays it up, lets

the legend grow, takes time off from

his stage act and starts showcasing

the chip on his shoulder.

CUT TO SCENE:

DUPREE (CONT'D)

He buys into his bullshit, building

street cred, he's got plans and pull,

he's makin' plays, living the mob

life for real. Somehow, it takes:

Lounge act turned legitimate thug.

DUPREE

In reality, he doesn't know the ball

from the bounce...He's not a crook,

so he starts fucking up fast and

picking up speed, putting a floodlight

on the whole Carlotta organization.

Cops get curious, start camping out,

compiling names and faces and pretty

soon Israel's bullshit has brought

the heat to bear on none other than

Primo Sparraza--

7.

LOCKE (V.O.)

--Enforcer.    Extortionist.   Killer.

CUT TO:

LOCKE

Sparazza is rumored to have performed

in excess of one-hundred and thirty

contract murders, including one of

the bureau's most celebrated agents.

Freeman Heller. You heard of "The

Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.

MESSNER

I thought Heller was a double op?

CUT TO SCENE:

LOCKE (V.O.)

No. He worked for the O.S.S. before

joining the Bureau in its heyday.

He was the first operative assigned

with infiltrating the mob.

CUT TO SCENE:

LOCKE (V.O. CONTD) (CONT'D)

Full immersion and assimilation,

fake identity, falsified background,

everything that is now standard

operating procedure, Heller

implemented, way back when.

CUT TO SCENE:

8.

LOCKE (CONT'D)

And as a result, his undercover work

was wildly successful. He eventually

reached the rank of Capo inside the

Carlotta crime family...but through

some internal slip-up, his cover was

compromised and Primo Sparazza was

given the contract to kill him.

CUT TO:

LOCKE (V.O.)

There wasn't enough evidence to bring

formal charges, so the case never

went to trial.

LOCKE (CONT'D)

Sparazza is a bit of a specter.

Over the years, the serious crimes

with which he was thought to be

involved, including Heller's murder,

could never be traced back to him.

LOCKE

A dedicated viciousness and a slavish

devotion to mob doctrine had

Sparazza's star on the rise. So

the mob relocated him to Nevada and

he became the unofficial head of the

Las Vegas LCN.

CUT TO SCENE:

9.

MESSNER

So he's personally issued the contract

on Israel?

LOCKE

Sparazza was the one who introduced

Israel to the life, gave him his

first big break, brought him through

the ranks.

CARRUTHERS

Made him a friend of the family.

CUT TO SCENE:

LOCKE (V.O.)

...His hand-picked protege, successor

to the throne...and Israel played

the situation very shrewd.

LOCKE (CONT'D)

...Slowly amassing the loyalties of

Sparazza's top men...with plans of

toppling the throne.

CUT TO SCENE:

LOCKE (CONT'D)

In doing so, he plunged the Carlotta

organization into a civil war,

splitting the family into dual

factions. Sparazza on one side,

Israel on the other. The infighting

that followed drew the interest of

nearly every major investigative

body operating under the canopy of

the federal government.

LOCKE (cont'd; V.O.)

Presently there are sixteen state

and federally funded agencies, running

concurrent criminal probes on select

members of the LCN...With Israel

(MORE)

10.

LOCKE (cont'd; V.O.) (CONT'D)

being the primary target in virtually

every investigation.

CUT TO SCENE

MESSNER (V.O.)

A marked man gets wise and wants to

come in.

LOCKE (V.O.)

His testimony has the potential of

blowing the lid off what's left of

the La Cosa Nostra is this country.

That alone warrants total immunity

from prosecution and and a vanishing

act with Witness Protection.

MESSNER

So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna

and Padiche, the mention of Israel's

heart?

LOCKE

--Your intel corroborates what we

already know. Sparazza's health is

in rapid decline and before his date

with destiny, it seems he wants one

last thing...The heart of his sworn

enemy. A recently opened, cash rich

escrow account has been traced back

to Sparazza. This and the mention

of this mysterious Swede makes the

million dollar contract on Israel

very real.

SYKES (V.O.)

How real...?

CUT TO:

WYMAN

How 'bout six-figures for this fool?

How 'bout that love?

11.

SYKES

Bulllllshit...

WYMAN

Naw baby, they heard about that Triad

hit, the work ya'll put in and they

recognize the skills. And this ain't

no tryout, tap-dance "show us your

shit" thing neither-- if ya'll want

this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.

WATTERS

So me and Sis here, 'cuz we got a

rep on a rise, we chipped some nails

on some niggas, they want us to drop

this mafiaoso so and so, magician,

whatever-the fuck he is.

WYMAN

S'way it works girl. Ya'll done dirt,

ya'll peeled some serious caps.

Word travels.

SYKES

And so I get this straight, we gotta

go in, bust on this punk and remove

the heart? Is that for real?

WYMAN

No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get

him, pull'm out of wherever he at,

forget all that other shit, that's

just f'flavor. I'm still getting

lil' bits'a this-n-that from this

cat Padiche, the man contacting

me...Right now, what we got--

(nod to telex)

--Is a number and a name...Buddy

Israel.

SYKES

(to Loretta)

What else did Padiche say?

WYMAN

He said that the shit could get hot,

could get heavy...I said good.

(beat, grins)

'Cuz I got two of the hottest,

heaviest bitches alive.

MESSNER (V.O.)

Like who?

12.

LOCKE

Like Pasquale Acosta, blood money

mercenary. His countrymen have dubbed

him the more dubious "El Estrago"

(beat)

The Plague.

CUT TO SCENE:

LOCKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

American educated, fluent in over a

dozen languages, did journeyman's

work for CIA funded "G-2" and

"Archivo" death squads in Guatemala

and Chile...noted for his legendary

torture techniques.

CUT TO SCENE:

LOCKE (CONT'D)

Sought for war crimes and human rights

violations in eighteen different

countries. When he was caught by

the SAS in Northern Ireland and

imprisoned, he chewed off his

fingertips to the bone before he

could be printed and ID'd by Interpol.

CUT TO SCENE:

LOCKE (CONT'D)

On an extradition flight back to El

Salvador, he murdered a security

detachment and vanished.

MESSNER

You think it's possible he could be

involved in the Israel hit?

13.

LOCKE

Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary.

And a million dollar hit fee will

draw some huge flies. But forget

about Sparazza's money for a moment

and remember, there's no shortage of

those who want Israel killed and no

shortage of cash to do just that...

DUPREE (V.O.)

...Then I'm sure you've heard of

these guys...The Tremor brothers.

CUT TO:

DUPREE

No?

(off dull stares from

Deeks and Elmore)

Then you've both been living under

the same rock, 'cuz these cocksuckers

are infamous. Three brothers, same

skank mom, different deadbeat dads,

used for that suicide-kamikaze style

shit. You heard about that huge shoot-

out in Cleveland?

DEEKS

Is that the club that got wiped out

a couple months back?

ELMORE

What happened?

DUPREE

The Teamsters had a reform measure

going to ballot that didn't sit too

well with the local syndicate. Night

of the polling, big black-tie to-do

downtown and the Tremor Brothers

crash the party. Literally.

SMASH CUT TO:

14.

DUPREE (V.O.)

Donald McGarey, the local union rep,

is the mark. The Tremors go ripshit

riot on the whole club, seven people

dead, twenty-eight wounded. Just to

get to this one guy.

DUPREE (CONT'D)

--And they get it about as good as

they give it. In the melee, one of

the brothers catches blowback from a

jammed piece and is temporarily

blinded, the other takes bullets to

the lower back and can't walk. The

third gets popped in the neck and

passes out. McGarey gets out of the

club alive...and not much further...

CUT TO:

DUPREE

They're speed freaks, neo-nazi's.

Sworn to the swastika, supposedly

read and recite "Mein Kampf" like

Mother Goose...And these motherfuckers

can go megaton at the drop of a hat.

SYKES (V.O.)

What's the name again?

WYMAN

"Soot, Lazlo Soot." Lotta folks want

this white boy clapped. Soot could

be workin' for one 'em.

15.

WYMAN (V.O.)

Nobody really certain where he come

from...

WYMAN (CONT'D)

...and when he moves on somebody,

they the last ones t'see it comin'--

DUPREE (V.O.)

So what do you think?

ELMORE

I think it's idiotic to continue

this conversation.

(turns, to Deeks)

We're ex-cops which means we weren't

great cops or even good ones.

DEEKS

Paying bills with bullshit casino

jobs, sitting watch on slot machines.

ELMORE

Which was a great gig until we we

walked in here and started drinking.

DUPREE

The bond on Israel expires in eighteen

hours, after that, it's a jump ball.

Our window is now.

16.

DEEKS

Who posted his bail?

DUPREE

His law firm, same one that hired

me. Israel walked out after he made

bail and nobody's seen him since.

ELMORE

Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel

is really the great white whale of

snitches, then the mob is looking to

put all kinds of bullets into his

ass and pour some serious psychotics

into the mix to do just that. So

what real incentive is there to track

him on something as small-time as a

skip trace, when it's putting you

and yours in the path of severe pain

and suffering and an almost certain

prelude to doom.

DUPREE

So I guess you're not going.

ELMORE

Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why

stop there, why not take Fort Knox

with a fucking slingshot or go into

Hell after Hitler...I like your

chances a lot more.

DUPREE

I know his location, we've got the

drop of a maybe half a day before

that location gets grape-vined and

the rest of the world gets hipped.

ELMORE

That's already happened hoss.   It's

naive to think otherwise.

DEEKS

Where is he?

WYMAN (V.O.)

--Lake Tahoe.

17.

WATTERS

Three hours t'the east. S'day trip.

Pretty this time a'year too...

SYKES

We gotta lay something out, strategy-

wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there

ad-libbing, it's y'ass.

WATTERS

What are we talkin' on the split...

WYMAN

Forty-five apiece for you two, ten

percent finders fee for me.

SYKES

What's the time frame?

WYMAN

Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we

can get you there. We wait any

longer, someone goin' dead this fool.

MESSNER (V.O.)

...Then we lose our witness.

CUT TO:

LOCKE

We lose our case. Twenty-four hours

from now, he's scheduled to meet

with federal prosecutors. His agent,

a man by the name of Morris Mecklen,

has guaranteed us that he'll enter

into protective custody once his

deal is approved.

CUT TO:

18.

LOCKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

We've been monitoring Mecklen's calls

and have learned that Israel is

staying in the penthouse level of

the Nomad Hotel and Casino in Lake

Tahoe, Nevada under an assumed name.

CARRUTHERS

Right there? In the high-roller suite?

MESSNER

It's the last place they'd look.

LOCKE

Israel's legal representation, the

firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed,

which is currently the subject of a

joint SEC and Treasury Department

probe, were left holding the bag

after he skipped bail. Over three-

quarters of a million dollars on a

bond that's set to expire in less

than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the

firm's partners, has learned of

Israel's whereabouts and dispatched

a local bondsman by the name of Jack

Dupree to pick him up and return him

to Las Vegas...that can't happen.

(beat)

We have a Gulf Stream standing by at

Reagan International to transport

you two to Lake Tahoe.

(pause, with weight)

It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi,

Fratiano, Gravano-- no former witness

against the mob has been as crucial

or has brought more to bear on the

potential dissolution of The La Cosa

Nostra, than Buddy Israel.

19.

LOCKE (CONT'D)

...But understand that if an attempt

is made on his life...

LOCKE (CONT'D)

...then it is being made by those of

the strictest professional caliber...

LOCKE (CONT'D)

...They are cold-blooded, ruthless,

and without restraint...and they

must not succeed.

MAN

...he's here now...

20.

ISRAEL

D'you talk to'm?

HUGO

(fetching Mylanta

from the fridge)

I got his machine.

ISRAEL

What'd you say?

HUGO

(gulping Mylanta)

I said I got his machine.

ISRAEL

No, what did you say on the machine?

HUGO

I left him a message.

ISRAEL

I know you left him a message. What

did you say!

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

Jesus Hugo!

(MORE)

21.

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

How is it that you can turn a simple

conversation into a fucking hedge

maze!? This is zero degree of

difficulty man!

HUGO

Okay.

ISRAEL

Then why are you still looking at me

like I'm asking for the square root

of something! What did you say!?

HUGO

I said that we were returning his

call and you were real concerned,

because he sounded real concerned.

ISRAEL

Look at that, we didn't have to fill

up the whole blackboard after all.

Now, do you know anything about that?

HUGO

About what?

ISRAEL

Look at the collar on that coat...

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

What's that look like, that stain?

HUGO

I dunno...Cinnamon roll?

ISRAEL

Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though.

No, Hugo that looks like jizz...

(reshuffles, stares)

And I'm no forensic expert mind you,

but that looks like some fuckhead

shot their load on a twelve-thousand

dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist?

It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's

skin jacket.

(beat, then)

So y'got semen, human ejaculate--

(MORE)

22.

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

(checks watch)

--that's been allowed to soak in for

what, six, seven hours now? Work

it's way into the fabric-fuck'n

fibers-- and while you may never see

it in a Tide commercial, I think it

still safely qualifies as a "tough,

deep down stain."

HUGO

I could have it sent out...

ISRAEL

...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm

almost dead certain there's not a

fucking laundry detergent or dry

cleaning process known to man that

can ever return that jacket to its

former glory! Some shit, suffice it

to say, just don't wash out.

(beat, cooling down)

Now, the money question...To whom

does that stain belong?

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

C'mon, somebody was banging one of

these skanks, sans rubber--

(beat, assesses girls)

-which is terrifying in its own right-

pulled out, let 'er rip and ruined

the last gift my mother gave me before

she died.

(snatching up coat)

The way I see it, it's the same as

if she was dug up, three months dead

and it was shot right on her rotting

corpse, 'cuz that's how it defiled

this feels!

HUGO

Do you want me to say I did it?

ISRAEL

I was kinda hoping, yeah.

HUGO

Do you want me to say I'm sorry?

ISRAEL

Only if you really, truly mean it.

23.

HUGO

...I'm sorry...

ISRAEL

Are you a fucking colossal idiot?

HUGO

I am.   Yeah.

ISRAEL

Without peer?

HUGO

I-- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.

ISRAEL

(showing him the card)

No. Be sure. Be resolute.    You stand

alone on that summit.

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

Get the phone, it might be Gill,

then get out of my sight.

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

No. The cards can stay there. Get

The Goddamn Phone.

CUT TO:

CARRUTHERS

Yes Sir. Go ahead.

(listens, checks watch)

We're three miles from The Nomad

now. We'll be awaiting word.

24.

SERNA (ON TAPE)

--so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this

in the next day or so, get to Israel

before the Swede can--

MESSNER

Anything on the Swede?

CARRUTHERS

Only the mention made in that phone

call. There's no Swedish hitman of

any renown, much less one with a

million dollar day rate.

MESSNER

Maybe he's that good. Never been

caught, no criminal record.

CARRUTHERS

Maybe.

MESSNER (CONTD)

I tell you, engineering this kind of

play against Sparazza, going to the

lengths these guys are going

to...they're playing some long odds.

CARRUTHERS

And a very bad gamble.

MESSNER

(re; the passing neon)

Well... This is as good a place for

it as any I guess.

CUT TO:

25.

PADICHE

Girls, wonderful, here, sit.

PADICHE (CONTD) (CONT'D)

Okay, so...you're here, really nice

isn't it? Brisk weather, but nice.

(as WAITRESS approaches)

Coffee? Anything? I didn't want to

order for you.

WATTERS

No, we're cool.

PADICHE

Fabulous.

(to Waitress)

I'm fine sweetheart, thanks.

(beat, back to girls)

Okay, so...welcome to the south shore!

(big smile, then)

So, just jumpin' right in, just in

terms of this thing, our thing. I

spoke to Lorenzo this morning, he

says y'got somethin' more or less

put together, plan'a attack and me

and my associate Mr. Serna, who I

can put on the phone hear, we'd

love t'hear it.

PADICHE (CONT'D)

We ain't askin' ya t'take us through,

soup t'nuts or 'nuthin' like that, I

jus' like t'hear the broad strokes,

y'know, so we can get an idea--

WATTERS

Pussy.

PADICHE

Wha'?

SYKES

Pussy.

PADICHE

(leaning closer)

"Pushy?"

26.

WATTERS

Pussy.

PADICHE

--Uh...

WATTERS

Israel likes pussy...

PADICHE

...Oh...uh-huh, yeah--

SYKES

And we like that he likes...

PADICHE

...Pussy?

SYKES

Correct.

PADICHE

...Fabulous.

REED

Yeah, Jack, alright...hey--

(shakes Deeks' hand)

Nice t'meet you. Rip Reed.

DEEKS

Pete.

27.

REED

Okay, good, good, c'mon, c'min.

REED (CONTD) (CONT'D)

(to Dupree)

Where's your third? This was a

troika, no?

DUPREE

He's...fuckin'...he's comin'...

REED

(extending hand)

Hey, hey how r'ya, Rip Reed.

ELMORE

Hollis.   Elmore.

REED

(to Deeks)

So Jack tells me you're both ex-cops?

DEEKS

Yeah, that's right.

DUPREE

They worked as swingmen for the Vegas

Vice squad--

(to Deeks)

What? Five, six years?

REED

Man the stories you guys must tell.

I grew up soft myself, private

schools, little blazers, you "Talked

it out" nobody threw punches, t'this

day, never been hit with a fist,

Imagine that, huh?

(MORE)

28.

REED (CONT'D)

Pretty much a panty-waste, trembling

little faggot-fairy when I smell

trouble-- and I don't say this to be

self-deprecating, I just don't have

much of an opinion about myself, I

mean, shit, I wish I was a lot more

like you guys, barfighters, big

swinging dicks, gettin' it done.

Sadly.

(lifts his shirt,

exposes torso flab)

This is it. It's...disgusting.

(with a look skyward)

Thanks God, dogpile a piss-poor

physique with an small cock and

hereditary alcoholism! 'preciate it!

(beat, to Dupree)

Okay, I'm babbling, I do this when I

drink, forgive the rants, let's get

at it here. This wanted felon fucking

prick bastard Buddy Israel and the

nearly one million dollar bail bond.

DUPREE

Rip, my right hand to God, we're

gonna go in and recover this asshole

and everybody's gonna leave the

theater grinning. Trust me.

REED

That confidence translates bro,

seriously, it does! Out-STANDING!

REED (CONT'D)

I'm a lawyer, y'know, I need to hear

these things, little boosts, helps

allay my fears, I pass that piece of

mind along to my partners.

(beat, then)

Alright, so, couple primers for you

guys, maybe things we might've looked

past that you should know about...His

hangers-on, these idiots Israel

runs with, they're all "packing heat"

"strapped" whatever the phrase is.

Point two, Israel likes hookers, so

you might run into a harem up there.

Point three: He binges between a six-

to-seven thousand dollar a day cocaine

habit that nobody knows about, so he

(MORE)

29.

REED (CONT'D)

and those hookers, will most likely

be high. He also drinks, self-

medicates, the whole cliche, y'know?

The strung out hasbeen jerkoff snitch

drunk. The seven-layer loser.

(beat, exhales)

I'm praying he puts up a fight,

please, please, please, rape him if

possible, I'll-pay-the-extra-whatever--

REED (CONT'D)

Yeah-yeah-yeah. Fucking hell, this

feels GREAT! YEAH!? DOESN'T IT!

REED (CONT'D)

(hands envelope over)

Okay, we had a retainer, for services

to be rendered...Fifty thousand

dollars.

ISRAEL (V.O.)

FIFTY-FUCKING GRAND!

CUT TO:

SIR IVY

Calm down.

ISRAEL

Don't tell me to "calm down" Ivy! I

hate that!

(re; the phone)

HUGO GRAB THAT! I JUST PAGED GILL!

SIR IVY

Look at the attention we're getting.

It's all bad...

30.

HUGO

Hey-- It's him, it's Gill.

SIR IVY

(gesturing to hookers)

...We got these tricks going in and

out, we're partying like the shit

might go stale, what did you think

was gonna happen?

ISRAEL

Fifty grand gouge. South shore

hayseeds, this is why I never play

Tahoe, or redneck Reno...

SIR IVY

We're hot, and they're losing a whole

floor's worth of business saying

it's "under construction."

ISRAEL

Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling

out that kinda bread for this

shithole, this is a junior suite in

Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he

should have his cell on, I need an

update.

(to Hugo)

Get the Russian up here, have him

clean this place, floor to ceiling

and get us packed .

(points to hookers)

...And send out for some new skeeze,

the sun's up, these ones are starting

to stink...

SIR IVY

BEANIE!

BEANIE

(addressing the girls)

Alright ya'll, that's the call, we

had our fun, pack it in, pro-ceed to

the front. Les' go, les' go--

31.

ISRAEL

Are you on a land line?

DR. GILL

Yeah, why.

ISRAEL

Just checking...what's up?   What's

wrong with your voice?

DR. GILL

I've got concerns.

ISRAEL

...About what?

DR. GILL

About cocaine...and the amount you're

doing.

ISRAEL

I'm not doing cocaine.

DR. GILL

Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor,

I'm a physician, be honest, or be

dead within a day...s'your choice.

DR. GILL (CONT'D)

...I just got the cardiology work-up

back and sent it to two of my

colleagues, both heart specialists.

They concluded, as I have, that you

are showing signs of severe cardiac

distress...so much so, that a massive

coronary may be imminent.

32.

BEANIE (CONTD)

Damn girl, look out now!

BEANIE (CONT'D)

(holding up heel)

All these good for is poppin' them

titties girl, but y'see what happens

when you try to get around in 'em?

DR. GILL (O.S. ON PHONE)

--Forget about the tissue damage

you're doing to the heart itself.

Sustained cocaine abuse will segue

you from a very painful ventricular

fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.

(beat)

Buddy, nobody knows about your

condition, or your drug use. Why

you lied to me, knowing that I'd

find out anyway, I'll never know,

but it imperative now that I see

you.

ISRAEL

That's not possible. I told you.

DR. GILL

There are certain meds, certain

intravenous measures that can

counteract some of the damage you've

done, but I'd have to administer

them myself.

ISRAEL

Won't work, we're just gonna have to

chance it man. I'm sorry.

33.

DR. GILL

No. Sorry comes later, when you're

in a partial coma with ambulatory

paralysis. Sorry comes when we have

to decide which of your limbs have

to be amputated because severely

constricted blood flow has brought

about a gangrenous infection, sorry--

ISRAEL

--Fine, fuck, I got it...Lake Tahoe,

Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your

flight, you can be here in a couple

hours. He'll meet you at the airport.

DR. GILL

...He's in Lake Tahoe.

CUT BACK TO:

ISRAEL

Be cool, be cool, be cool...c'mon...

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

Just this last little bit, then we're

done, just this tiny bit and that's

it, that's it, all of it, over--

BEANIE

Awwww, motherfuck me! C'mon woman!

Hold your shit! This is silk!

34.

ISRAEL

(to himself, quiet)

...How the mighty have fallen...

CARRUTHERS (V.O.)

He's awake.

CUT TO:

CARRUTHERS

Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel.

Penthouse level. There was apparently

a fisticuffs with some prostitutes.

He wasn't involved. He's also had

his people phone a local madame for

another group of girls.

MESSNER

No rest for the wicked.

(beat, holds up file)

Why were we never shown these files?

We're sitting on Sparazza for what?

Six months now and we're just seeing

this?

(beat, reading)

Did you know that he's has had thirty-

six major medical procedures performed

on him since 1953?

(flips, reads)

Elective plastic surgery, every single

one--

MESSNER (CONT'D)

--look at this, look at the work

he's had done; nose, three times,

eyes, eyelids, chin, jaw-- he's had

his jaw done a dozen times.

(MORE)

35.

MESSNER (CONT'D)

You take every hasbeen actor in

Hollywood they haven't been cut this

much.

MESSNER (CONT'D)

Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall-

to-wall major felony offenses, murder,

extortion, arson, grand larceny--

(beat, points)

--A paternity suit...I just feel

like we're playing catch-up with all

this and we shouldn't be.

CARRUTHERS

Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody

shares information anymore, it's

become synonymous with job security.

MESSNER

Based on what we had, I thought

Sparazza was a mid-level player at

best and it turns out he's this mob

relic, running the show out west.

CARRUTHERS

He's stayed below the radar. You

don't kill a hundred and thirty people

without knowing how to tip-toe.

MESSNER

But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed

Heller. Why not go after him, guns

blazing' for that one?

CARRUTHERS

Heller was buried in agency lore,

anytime an operative failed or was

perceived to have failed, Hoover

blackballed their memory. Look at

Ness.

MESSNER

Yeah, but the Untouchables took down

Capone. Heller got shot and killed.

The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza

walked.

36.

CARRUTHERS

It's almost five a.m. in D.C. now.

Locke said the lawyers from Justice

had been in there since three o'clock

yesterday afternoon. Israel's manager

is acting as his attorney and that's

what's holding things up.

MESSNER

So he has no idea what's about to

happen?

CARRUTHERS

No. And I want to be in that room a

half second after Mecklen calls to

say the deal's done. We've got a

sheriff's task force on stand-by.

MESSNER

What about the hotel staff obstructing

us. Israel's obviously paid off the

management.

CARRUTHERS

Tampering with a witness extraction

of this magnitude makes everyone

indictable at the federal level.

(beat, grins)

Trust me, we won't any problems with

the hotel staff. You show 'em your

ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all

caps and it's instant compliance.

I've seen in happen a hundred times.

CUT TO:

VOICE (O.S.)

Special Agent Gerald Diego, Federal

Bureau of Investigation, San Francisco

ACOSTA

We're conducting a series of impromptu

inspections for the Nevada Gaming

(MORE)

37.

ACOSTA (CONT'D)

Commission. I'd like to speak with

your head of security.

DEEKS (V.O.)

Where'd you get these?

CUT TO:

DUPREE

Same place that rents the guard's

uniforms. There's a shift change at

9am. Graveyard goes home and we can

blend in with the day shift coming

on.

DEEKS

What about access cards? Pass keys?

DUPREE

We'll have to get our hands on them.

There's two separate units; Casino

Floor/Count Room Security and General

Hotel Security--

(annoyed, nods to car)

Does he want to hear this or what?

DEEKS

Hollis!

DUPREE

Nobody put a gun to your head.

ELMORE

Yeah, we've been through that.

38.

DUPREE

Then quit acting like somebody shit

in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave

us fifty grand.

ELMORE

--Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing

here, aren't I?

(beat, to both men)

Shouldn't that be enough? That I

made the trip?

DUPREE

Your attitude sucks.

ELMORE

I been accused of worse.

(glancing at uniforms)

What do we got...?

DUPREE

Two security levels, the one we're

going in under the guise of, hotel

security, has restricted access.

They're mostly there to monitor the

lobby, handle disturbances on the

different floors and toss out drunks.

(beat)

There's a thirty-five member employee

rotation going from graveyard to day

shift. If we split up, we can blend

in and enter unnoticed. Once we're

inside the hotel, we'll regroup.

ELMORE

Then what--

39.

JEEVES TREMOR

(still pissing)

Luvin' that, rat-tat-tat-tat, clean

as a nun's snatch on Kristal Nacht!

LESTER TREMOR

Shut up fuckass, them spirits ain't

vacated yet, s'keep quiet.

JEEVES TREMOR

Them spirts can kiss my Chinese ass.

LESTER TREMOR

DUPREE (DEAD)

...I forgive you Darwin.

DARWIN TREMOR

Shoot, I appreciate that man.

DUPREE

If I needed your I.D. and your car

and me and my brothers were wanted

by the law, I woulda killed you to

get 'em too.

DARWIN TREMOR

You woulda?

DUPREE

Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong

place at the wrong time. So don't

feel so bad dude.

DARWIN TREMOR

Damn...alright then.

DUPREE

I don't mind now anyway.

DUPREE (CONT'D)

You know, up here in Heaven, it's

beautiful. Way better than fuckin'

Hawaii or any place like that.

DARWIN TREMOR

Really?

DUPREE

I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm

gonna get laid by some fine ass angels

and then go hang out with Jesus and

them.

DARWIN TREMOR

Man, that's great.

DUPREE

I got it made in the shade Amigo.

Hey, I'll see you up here some day,

don't worry.

DARWIN TREMOR

You think so?

DUPREE

I know so.

DARWIN TREMOR

Damn Jack...you was after the same

sacka shit as us...Small world.

DUPREE

Don't tell your asshole brothers you

know about it, that money is for you

old boy.

41.

DARWIN TREMOR

I appreciate that pard...I wish I

coulda been a better friend.

DARWIN TREMOR (CONTD) (CONT'D)

Alright enough grabassin' goddamit!

We need t'get over t'that hotel.

WATTERS (V.O.)

We're already here baby.

CUT TO:

WYMAN (O.S.)

(on the phone)

So everything's cool then?

WATTERS

We sat down with Padiche, he tried

to get some details which we wasn't

gonna give up, but it's all good.

We goin' check Sis in first, 'fore I

check in across the street.

WOMAN

Will you be needing a room with two

double beds?

SYKES

(quickly)

No, we're not together.

WATTERS

C'mon baby, don't be shy.

(MORE)

42.

WATTERS (CONT'D)

(to woman)

Just one bed please.

(beat, to Sykes smiling)

Although if we sweat that one up, we

goin' need some clean sheets.

(As Sykes pulls away)

C'mon Girl, you know I'm playing!

WATTERS (CONT'D)

(over her shoulder to

the departing hookers)

..If ya'll let hoochie like that

stay up in here, ya'll must be burning

sheets by the ton.

WATTERS (CONT'D)

You just goin' grin? Y'ain't goin

comment on that, at all? Trampy ass

skeezers, doin' damage they ain't

even smart enough to see. That don't

gall you at all?

(beat, closer)

Bitches like those are the same ones

runnin' feminism right to the brink

girl. Bitches like that the reason

mafuckas don't take our species

seriously. We jus' meat for male

consumption, we jus' pieces a'ass

and pussy, somethin' pretty in

lipstick and eye liner can suck cock.

WATTERS (CONTD) (CONT'D)

Bitches like that make me weep for

what could be-- if we could all,

sisters everywhere, black, white,

yellow and brown, put our shit down

one time, unified front, the force

of the female race, mobilized, moving

as one...

SYKES

I'm gonna need a mini-bar key too.

DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)

I don't understand.

LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)

I didn't ask for your understanding.

I asked you to say your name, followed

ISRAEL

They're gonna give on this in the

next ten seconds or the deal's off!

MECKLEN (O.S.)

I dunno what to say to you sweetheart,

it is what it is.

ISRAEL

Bullshit it is. I said, about as

loud as I could say it, "no jail

time for my guys."

CUT TO:

MECKLEN

And they're not going give there

pally. They're bricking us on that

particular issue.

MECKLEN (CONTD) (CONT'D)

Baby, I've been co-habitating with

these people for the past thirty odd

hours and in so doing, have stared

into the face of hell. These are the

premier prick cocksuckers of all

time and I feel beaten by them, I

feel bloodied--

ISRAEL

--and you're gonna feel altogether

fucked, by me, if you don't handle

this. I'm the one, does the face

plant, this falls apart, not you.

MECKLEN (V.O.)

And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed,

but it's one'a those fait accompli

things, you have to--

ISRAEL

I don't have to do shit! Which

includes cooperating any further

with these motherfuckers until I get

what I want!

(MORE)

46.

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

(beat, considers,

looks over at Hugo)

Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand

'em somebody from our end and they're

being hard-ons about it-- make it

Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs

that regimented thing that prison

provides--

MECKLEN

--Buddy, it's bigger than that, they

want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie--

ISRAEL

--this isn't a swap meet Morrey,

they're getting Sparazza and the

west coast syndicate, giftwrapped,

now if that's not good enough--

MECKLEN

--Listen kid, let's not antagonize

this any more. I got 'em backed

down on the book and t.v. deals.

They're agreeing to give you all the

after tax profits, so you can come

away with some chits and live

comfortably. If we push this, they'll

revoke your protective status, which

nullifies any agreement you got with

the government...Now that's mate and

checkmate kiddo and once that happens,

the shit'll start falling down around

your ears, real fast.

ISRAEL

Alright...do it.

CARRUTHERS (V.O.)

Israel just rolled.

CUT TO:

47.

MESSNER

He's giving them up?

CARRUTHERS

All of 'em. His entire entourage. I

think we should move.

MESSNER

Did the Justice lawyers sign off?

CARRUTHERS

That's happening in about ten minutes.

Israel's at optimum risk of flight

right now, so we can't wait.

MESSNER

What about the sheriff's task force?

CARRUTHERS

Have them mobilized. I'll phone

security and have the elevators locked

down and stairwells secured. We

need to keep Israel sequestered in

that penthouse.

SECURITY SUPERVISOR (V.O.)

No, I'm sorry, the penthouse is

currently under construction.

ACOSTA

(to Bill)

Can I speak to you privately?

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

Gary, let's get our personnel up in

the catwalk over twelve, that stickman

has been acting odd and I don't like

the rolls that table has been getting.

EMPLOYEE

Got it.

48.

ACOSTA

It's gotta be tough keeping an eye

on everything.

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

And everybody, all the time. Yeah,

it's a chore.

ACOSTA

So, Bill, if I understand this right,

you currently have your penthouse

floor under construction?

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

That's correct.

ACOSTA

(points to monitors)

But with these down, doesn't that

pose a major security concern if, as

you say, you have to keep an eye on

everything at all times?

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

Well, we were worried about dust and

debris from the work being done

ruining the cameras, so--

ACOSTA

--so you shut them off?

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

Yes, but no-- we have personnel

stationed at both ends of that hall,

twenty-four hours a day.

ACOSTA

What kind of personnel?

CUT TO:

SECURITY SUPERVISOR (V.O.)

Right now? A six man security force,

plus a member of our Butler staff.

So seven men total.

49.

ACOSTA

You have a butler working that floor?

CUT TO:

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

Uh-- well, yes, uh just in terms of

the men up there now, my team, he's

serving lunch and dinner and just

doing general upkeep so--

ACOSTA

So there are no guests staying on

that floor?

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

No. None at present.

ACOSTA

C'mon Bill...you've got some Sultan

up there, one of your whales, big-

spender, likes a lot of space, you

cook up this "construction" thing...?

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

No, no, no. We've been looking to

renovate that area of our hotel for

some time now. The security team is

only present to preserve floor

integrity, due to the roof access.

ACOSTA

Is your security team armed?

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

Of course.   Yes.

ACOSTA

And who has access to that floor?

50.

ACOSTA (CONTD) (CONT'D)

Bill, listen, I can ask you now and

you can answer me, or I can drag you

up to San Francisco and depose you

in front of a federal judge. Because

that's where we're headed here.

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to

see your identification again. We're

covering some sensitive material

here and I need to safeguard myself,

I'm sure you can understand.

ACOSTA

Of course, but if you could just

tell me who has access to that floor--

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

--I hold the sole pass key and

personally relieve the shifts myself.

Now if I could get your ID we can--

VOICE

(over phone)

Hello? This is Special Agent Donald

Carruthers of the FBI, I need an--

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

Is...that...blood?

51.

ACOSTA

Yes it is and right now it's filling

your lungs. In less than a minute,

you'll asphyxiate and pass out. You

shouldn't be feeling any pain now.

ACOSTA (CONT'D)

Close your   eyes. Think of something

wonderful.    Don't make this face the

last thing   you ever see.

(beat,   in Spanish)

Heaven may   hold it against you.

SECURITY SUPERVISOR

...Am I really dying...?

ACOSTA

Bill--

(out of respect)

Willliam...

(pause)

We're all dying...

Double homicide, gunshot vics, both

Deputy, have you made any ID's?

CARRUTHERS

(cups phone, to Messner)

Get a coroner's estimate too.

(back into his cell)

--Miss, I've been transferred and I

was disconnected. No one is answering

and I need someone from security to

pick up that line. It's urgent.

MESSNER

Dep-- Deputy, I'm going to put you

You need to hear this.

SHERIFF DEPUTY

Dupree, appears to be a bondsman out

of Las Vegas. He was just rolled

and printed by our medical examiner.

CARRUTHERS

Was there anything recovered?

SHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.)

We found a handwritten receipt in

his pocket for what looks like uniform

rentals. The name and phone number

of the rental house wasn't listed,

MESSNER

What kind of uniforms?

SHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.)

Receipt wasn't specific, the uniforms

were just listed as maroon in color.

MESSNER

Alright, deputy, we'll be there as

soon as possible, until we arrive, I

need you to limit physical access

and restrict movement to and from

the crime scene. Clear?

CARRUTHERS

Maroon uniforms?

MESSNER

Yeah. Have you been able to get

through to the Nomad's security?

CARRUTHERS

No.

(beat, decision)

I'm going over there. You take the

car from there, get out to the lake.

MESSNER

You going up to the Penthouse alone?

54.

CARRUTHERS

Yeah.

SYKES (V.O.)

That's a bad move.

CUT TO:

WATTERS (O.S.)

Why?

SYKES

'Cuz we don't need to draw any more

shit down on our heads. We hit

don't want to dead the whole floor

no matter how they make a living.

WATTERS

Wait, I'm getting some fucked up

feedback off that earpiece--

SYKES

SYKES

Alright, let's set this spinnin'...

SYKES

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

Well what the fuck!? I got the Doc

find out where the car is!

IVY

So what'd Mecklen have to say?

ISRAEL

They're getting close. It's down to

a handful of deal points now.

IVY

But it's all good right?

SIR IVY

So we're all traveling together,

getting sworn, giving our statements--

63.

ISRAEL

--I dunno the way it's gonna play

out, but-- yeah, it'll probably go

something like that.

SIR IVY

You believe in loyalty, don'tcha?

(pause, then)

'Specially the kind of loyalty where

an otherwise sensible motherfucker

puts his own best interests aside to

selflessly serve another. 'Cuz outside

a goddamn dog, that kinda loyalty,

my kinda shit, don't get any more

dedicated, or deep, or devout...

ISRAEL

CARRUTHERS (V.O.)

What I've been saying. Get me your

head of security right now.

CUT TO:

CASINO EMPLOYEE

CASINO EMPLOYEE

Wait-- He-- there, that's one of our

CARRUTHERS

Excuse me, sir.

BILL/ACOSTA

Yes.

CARRUTHERS

Special Agent Donald Carruthers.

We've got a situation developing

here in your hotel.

BILL/ACOSTA

How can I help you?

CARRUTHERS

I need to get to your penthouse level

immediately, I also need every other

elevator with access to that floor

evacuated and locked down.

BILL/ACOSTA

Is this an emergency?

CARRUTHERS

Let's hope not.

SYKES

I'm going down.

DARWIN TREMOR

SYKES

Not you. Some assholes on the

WATTERS

Alright, the ho train is exiting the

station. They're coming to you...

CUT TO:

ELMORE

(sputtering)

Hel-- I-- ambula-- pleeeeee--

CUT TO:

66.

MESSNER

No, no clarify. What is "an emergency

requisition of surrounding personnel?"

(beat, listens)

Within one-hundred mile radius,

understood-- Sacramento, Reno, Carson

City. So in less than an hour, we're

going to have anywhere from forty to

fifty odd field agents arriving,

without the slightest inkling as to

why they're here. Is that correct?

Am I misinterpreting that or--

(listens)

No, I'm not blaming any one person,

this is Bureau directive. But Agent

Carruthers is the SAC and he's out

of cell range at the moment, so I

can't contact him to--

(listens, frustrated)

Very well. I need to get Deputy

Director Locke on the phone as soon

as possible.

MESSNER (CONT'D)

Who's this?

CS TEAM MEMBER

Hollis Elmore, resident of Las Vegas,

formerly with the P.D. there. He's a

known associate of Dupree's.

CS TEAM MEMBER (CONT'D)

We found these washed up on shore.

MESSNER

What are these?

CS TEAM MEMBER

Elmore's fingers. Whorls are in bad

shape from the frostbite, but we got

a good pull for latents, positive

ID.

(beat, nod to bag)

Those were shot off.

MESSNER

Then we've got a third man missing.

67.

TASK FORCE CHIEF

We've recovered their car.

MESSNER

What car?

TASK FORCE CHIEF

Dupree's rental. A Dodge Stratus--

Picked up yesterday at a commuter

airport in Reno, Nevada.

MESSNER

(suddenly panicked)

--Where's it at now?

TASK FORCE CHIEF

In the parking structure of the Nomad.

CUT TO:

HUGO

Doc, I'm gonna tell 'em we're on our

Is there anything you need?

DR. GILL

I'm going up now, give me ten minutes,

that should be enough time to prep...

HUGO

C'mon, somebody answer...

That's a silk blend B, six-hundred

BEANIE (CONT'D)

soiled jacket)

Check the man's calf-skin coat too,

roll an' shit all over it--

BEANIE (CONT'D)

What the fuck!?

BEANIE (CONT'D)

(almost to himself)

Aw hell no you ain't just do that...

69.

SIR IVY

What did you say to Mecklen?

ISRAEL

That's probably him now...

SIR IVY

...See, this is one'a them rare

moments when y'ass get a chance to

be completely honest...and if I'm

asking you what you said to Mecklen,

assume the shit is rhetorical...so

assume I already know.

ISRAEL

A set of skills, God-given gifts, I

close my eyes.

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

King of Clubs...You pick up this

deck, s'just playing cards, I pick

up this deck it's a living, breathing

thing. What do you see right now?

You see exactly and only, what I

choose to show you....That's illusion

Ivy. That's the lie I tell your

eyes. The manipulation of movement.

Knowing where your gaze wants to go,

guiding it there. Making the magic

happen in that moment, that split-

second, but seeing behind it, knowing

it's all bullshit...Built on sand.

(MORE)

70.

ISRAEL (CONT'D)

(cards flying crazy)

I can show the Feds what they want

to see too. And make it as real as

this room. Make it more than smoke,

more than mirrors...and that's why

I'm valuable...and that's why you're

not.

(beat)

I never wanted it this way.

SIR IVY

Oh you ain't done a damn thing can't

be undone Playa. The dye ain't even

close t'cast. Y'wanna make some

shit real? No stage, no and lemme

say this one time...

CUT TO:

CARRUTHERS

(re: wall phone)

Can't you use the line in here to

contact your people.

ACOSTA/BILL

(not missing a beat)

No, these phones are hardwired

directly to maintenance. Once we

reach the penthouse, I can call down

and have the system taken off-line.

LOCKE

Pasquale Acosta-- Mercenary-- "El

Estrago"-- "The Plague"

LOCKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

When he was caught by the SAS in

Northern Ireland and imprisoned, he

chewed off his fingertips to the

bone before he could be printed and

ID'd by Interpol.

CARRUTHERS

Can't maintenance do that?

ACOSTA/BILL

Do what?

CARRUTHERS

Shut the elevators down.

72.

ACOSTA/BILL

An emergency shut down of our entire

elevated lift system? No sir. That

has to be handled by my staff.

CARRUTHERS

How long have you worked here?

(beat)

Bill.

SYKES

Girl, you hear that!?

WATTERS

Are you anywhere near the penthouse?

73.

SYKES

No, but that definitely sounds like

WATTERS

got an earpiece, you're picking up

their signal--

SYKES

--I thought we had secure frequency.

Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't

CUT TO:

106.

...CUT TO:

DR. GILL

Dr. Ingstrom, he's had a mild cardiac

episode and recurring arrhythmia,

I've given him 60cc's of Nobuneatol...

MESSNER

...Deputy Director Locke?

LOCKE

Here. Sit.   Please.

MESSNER

(pointing to Swede)

This is him? The hitman hired to

kill Israel? He's a doctor?

LOCKE

Difficult to explain everything now...

(beat, toward Israel)

And much larger issues loom.

(beat)

I'm sorry about Carruthers...Damndest

thing to have to die for.

107.

LOCKE (CONT'D)

(to The Swede)

Very well.

(to other Agents)

Take Mr. Israel to the roof, he'll

be traveling with us.

MESSNER

(to Locke, forceful)

What the hell-- What is this!? People

died. Agent Carruthers is dead!

LOCKE

We have to transport Mr. Israel to

Las Vegas, time is of the essence.

The gulfstream is standing by on the

jetway at Tahoe International. I'm

sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing

anymore information. Return to

Washington. You'll be debriefed in

the coming days.

CUT TO:

108.

109.

WATTERS

(whispering)

...I loved you baby...

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey...

ELMORE

(nodding to Cuda)

That your car?

DARWIN TREMOR

No, I'm confiscating it.

(holding up badge)

F.B.I.

ELMORE

You're F.B.I.?

DARWIN TREMOR

That's right...and I'd advise y'ta

lower your weapon sir.

110.

ELMORE

You investigating those murders out

at the lake?

DARWIN TREMOR

(blanching a bit)

Ww...uh...

ELMORE

Three men were ambushed and shot,

two died and had their bodies tossed

into the lake, the other has severe

hypothermia, possible dementia and

will probably be a multiple amputee

by week's end...if he even lives

that long.

DARWIN TREMOR

No, I ain't even heard abou--

ELMORE

(even more menace)

You "ain't"--

(beat, teeth clenched)

You have any idea how close to death

I've been? You understand that I'm

dying now? That I've survived bullets

and frostbite and raging fever--

(holding up hand)

missing fingers and every fucking

imaginable horror in between?

ELMORE (CONT'D)

And I'm asking you now, "Is that

your car" and you can't even come

clean and do me the decency of a

straight answer, with the fucking

state that I'm in!?

DARWIN TREMOR

Yeah, shit-- hell, you're right. I'm

sorry.

ELMORE

You shot me and murdered my friends.

DARWIN TREMOR

I did. We-- yeah, I know.

111.

ELMORE

And threw us into the lake.

DARWIN TREMOR

Pretty much, yep.

ELMORE

And this is your car, isn't it?

DARWIN TREMOR

Mmm-hmm.

ELMORE

But there were more of you?

DARWIN TREMOR

Yeah, m'brothers...They didn't make

it.

ELMORE

Two of 'em?

DARWIN TREMOR

(nods, tears flow)

Thass' right.

(beat, wiping eyes)

I got other brother's though, so it

ain't so bad.

ELMORE

You were here huntin' a man named

Israel, weren't you? Your name is

Tremor.

DARWIN TREMOR

I was. It is...That who you was here

for? Israel?

DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)

Well...we both got beat out then,

didn't we?

ELMORE

Yes we did...

(long pause, then)

Now, give me your car keys. And get

the fuck out of here.

112.

DARWIN TREMOR

S'fair...lemme just grab somethin'.

DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)

No, no, no, I'm done with all that.

DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)

(to 'Cuda)

Probably needs to be tuned. Air

filter's old. Plugs might be bad.

Heater and AC ain't worked in forever.

(seeing Elmore waver)

There's some good drugs in the glove

box there, homespun, keep you smiling,

semi-lucid at leas'...

(beat, puffing away)

Well, God's speed t'ya then. Sorry

'bout all that. S'way a'the world

though, winners and losers y'know.

S'way it's always goin' be...

ELMORE

...Oh, fuck that...

CUT TO:

113.

MESSNER

Your friends were taken to Carson

City Memorial, they're going to be

autopsied and shipped back for burial.

ELMORE

I'll take care of it.

MESSNER

Who owned this car?

ELMORE

The ones that killed 'em.

MESSNER

Where are they now?

ELMORE

I just want to go home man...I just

want to go home and forget this

fucking place even exists.

MESSNER

Where's that? Home.

ELMORE

Las Vegas.

MESSNER

You're injured...Let me drive.

114.

ORDERLY

Are you with the group on the third

floor?

ORDERLY (CONT'D)

Very well.

(turns, points)

You can take that stairwell up, the

I.C.U. is at the end of the hall.

CUT TO:

LOCKE

...for a press release. Officially,

he took his own life, suicide by

hanging, something of that sort.

Basic bullet points-- despondent

over the turn his career had taken,

troubles with the law, history of

substance abuse and so on--

MESSNER

Where's Israel?

LOCKE

What are you doing here?

MESSNER

My debrief--

LOCKE

(indignant)

--will be handled back in--

MESSNER

--no, we need to handle it now.

LOCKE

You were given instructions to get

on that plane and return to Washington--

115.

MESSNER

You're going to tell me why no call

was made to inform us that the Israel

situation had been "altered." Why I--

and my friend and partner, whose

body is going into a furnace tomorrow,

were not sufficiently apprised of

Bureau movement on this matter.

LOCKE

I can't discuss--

MESSNER

--You can and you will.

LOCKE

You're finished.

MESSNER

And you just figured that out?

(jams gun into ribs)

The Swede isn't a hitman, is he?

He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't

want Israel's heart for a trophy, he

wanted it for a transplant...why?

SMASH CUT TO:

LOCKE

...They're father and son...

MESSNER

...A paternity suit, filed 1967...

116.

LOCKE

--Brought against Sparazza by Israel's

mother Laverne who was nineteen at

the time. They had a brief affair

which Israel was the by-product of.

MESSNER

...Does he know?

LOCKE

...He does now...

MESSNER

So the wiretaps of Padiche and Serna--

CUT TO:

SERNA

--some Swede, real badass, supposedly

a "specialist"

CUT BACK TO:

LOCKE

Dr. Sven Ingstrom is head of

cardiology at Stockholm University

and the foremost heart specialist in

all of Europe--

LOCKE (CONT'D)

Sparazza was in failing health and

looking for a donor. The son who

had betrayed and burned him so

thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.

MESSNER

So all of our intel was bogus to

begin with.

LOCKE

Yes. The actual contract went to

Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to

his death from the Penthouse

yesterday. He was to neutralize

Israel's entourage and prep for the

removal of his heart.

(MORE)

117.

LOCKE (CONT'D)

Ingstrom was to handle the surgery

itself on-site with the assistance

of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal

physician, who was also on the

Sparazza payroll.

MESSNER

...When did you know all this?

LOCKE

Information was arriving all day

yesterday. When we finally figured

out who Sparazza actually was, we--

MESSNER

--What?

(after a moment)

What do you mean "Who Sparazza

actually was..."

LOCKE

...Are you insane?

MESSNER

...Almost.

(pulling hammer back)

What do you mean "who Sparazza

actually was..."

CUT TO:

MESSNER (CONT'D)

You realize that Sparraza has had

thirty-six major medical procedures

performed on him since 1953? Elective

plastic surgery, every single one--

LOCKE

It wasn't elective. It was undertaken

to save his life. And it wasn't

cosmetic, it was reconstructive...Look

at the date of the first procedure.

118.

MESSNER

(reading)

...Yeah, fifty-three.

LOCKE

The same year that Sparazza murdered

Agent Freeman Heller...

MESSNER

(as if to himself)

...holy shit...that's Heller...

(back to Locke)

Isn't it?

LOCKE

Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias.

He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed

under for over ten years, amassing

materials against the mafia and other

criminal syndicates. He may have

ripped the organization wide open,

pre-Appalachia, but his superiors

were convinced that he had gone rogue,

swapped allegiances...So they gave

the order to terminate his cover.

LOCKE (CONT'D)

He survived the shooting but the

injuries he sustained triggered a

degenerative bone disease that

required constant surgery, forever

altering his features...so he assumed

his alias full-time.

(MORE)

119.

LOCKE (CONT'D)

The figment that was Primo Sparazza

became flesh and blood.

(beat)

Freeman Heller was no more.

CUT TO:

CARRUTHERS

--Heller was buried in agency lore-

LOCKE

The agents of that era are all dead

and gone, history had defaulted to

fable...until now. You can imagine

the shock this sent through the

corridors of power in D.C. Heller's

op predates the second world war.

That's over sixty years of intel.

Do you know how valuable that could

be? The man's a treasure trove.

MESSNER

...So you made another deal?

LOCKE

I wouldn't go that far.

MESSNER

But you did, and have...And now people

are dead.

(beat, seething)

Did Sparazza become more valuable

than Israel...and did you make another

deal?

LOCKE

Israel's agreement with the government

was tossed out. We're now attempting

to rehabilitate him to the point

where a transplant can be attempted.

MESSNER

(with disgust)

You're trying to save Sparazza?

LOCKE

No...We're trying to save Heller.

120.

MESSNER

...So you knew all this and yet y--

LOCKE

(cutting him off)

--We needed cohesion to move forward.

Not conjecture.

MESSNER

...while Carruthers and a dozen others

lie dying, you debate semantics.

The Bureau's betrayed us...

(pointing to Sparazza)

The way they betrayed him...

LOCKE

I don't see it like that at all.

MESSNER

No, of course you don't...of course

you don't.

(long reflective pause)

...I gave all my belief and the better

part of my soul to this Bureau.

(beat, looking at the

wraith-like Sparazza)

...Look at the monsters you've made...

(beat, profoundly sad)

I won't be one of them.

LOCKE

I'll overlook what you've done here

today in light of what's taken place.

You've been fully debriefed. Now I

want you to return to D.C. immediately

and make no further inquiry into

this matter. I mean it. It's closed.

MESSNER

No...It's not.

(tossing Messner his

FBI ID)

What it lacks...is an end.
