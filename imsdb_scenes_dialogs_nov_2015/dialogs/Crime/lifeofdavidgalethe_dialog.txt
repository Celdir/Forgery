"THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE"

by

Charles Randolph

FIRST DRAFT

March 1, 1998

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

YOUNG MAN (O.S.)

It's probably been about seven

minutes...

COLLEGE GUY

Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement.

6:12. Roughly eight minutes.

(a beat as he records

the time)

Number 36 this year for the Great

State of Texas.

CONSTANCE

David, don't start throwing things.

DAVID

I'm going home. Let's do the press

fax tomorrow.

CONSTANCE

Go. I'll do it.

DAVID

Hey!

DAVID

Yo! Officer!

DAVID

Your seatbelt.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

ROBERTS (V.O.)

The high court also refused to stay

Friday's execution of former

philosophy professor, David Gale.

FEMALE (O.S.)

(with her mouth full)

Christ doin' Karaoke.

ROBERTS (V.O.)

Gale had sought a review of his 1993

conviction for the rape and murder

of University of Texas colleague,

Constance Harraway.

ROBERTS (V.O.)

Defense lawyers had hoped to argue

that Gale's former activism against

capital punishment unduly

prejudiced...

ROBERTS (V.O.)

...the Texas judicial system. Citing

'discriminating purpose' --

KRUGER

(into the phone)

Hey, they're not gonna stay Gale.

It's on Court TV right now, listen.

ROBERTS (V.O.)

...clear political gain in executing

its leading opponent of the death

penalty...

KRUGER

(into the phone,

swallowing)

So, what's it gonna be? Belyeu said

to call after the decision... No,

they said only Bitsey.

ROBERTS (V.O.)

(in b.g.)

...Further failed to consider that

the victim was herself an abolitionist

activist...

KRUGER

It means only Bitsey. Bill, I don't

get to make the rules, I'm a fat

black woman.

KRUGER

(into the phone)

...What we need is to put her on a

plane to Houston.

BITSEY (WOMAN)

Gale's going down.

KRUGER

(into the phone)

Why do you always get lordosis around

legal? She's here.

BITSEY

(to the phone)

Hi. What's lordosis?

BILL (V.O.)

Female ape's posture when preparing

for intercourse. Hello, Bitsey.

BILL (V.O.)

Look, kids, setting aside the cost

issue, though half-a-million dollars

for three two hour interviews is not

only illegal it's obscen--

KRUGER

Market value. Guy's never talked.

BILL (V.O.)

That aside, I, we are still

uncomfortable with the arrangement.

BITSEY

Meaning?

BILL (V.O.)

Meaning you've just spent a very

public seven days in jail for a very

public contempt of court citation.

BITSEY

Protecting sources, even kiddie porn

scumbags, is magazine policy.

BILL (V.O.)

And I, we continue to appreciate

your decision. We're just concerned.

A rapist slash murderer, five days

before he's executed, demands a

reporter known for protecting sexual

deviants. A reporter who is also a

very attractive woman --

KRUGER

This is disparate treatment.

BITSEY

I could go if I were an ugly blabby

guy?

BILL (V.O.)

There's an agenda issue here which

would be diffused with an older

male...

KRUGER

I hear lawyers gleefully saying the

words Bloom vs. News Magazine Inc.

BITSEY

'Well, Your Honor, I started to notice

that my assignments were evaluated

on the basis of my sex.'

KRUGER

You've gotta let her go now.

BILL (V.O.)

That's not quite what I meant.

KRUGER

He's gotta let you go.

BITSEY

'Certain references were made -- '

BILL (V.O.)

(interrupting)

All right. All right. Enough. The

intern is with you at all times?

KRUGER

Yes. I, we are hanging up. 'Bye.

BITSEY

I'm not baby-sitting.

BITSEY

Gale was seen leaving the house.

BITSEY (V.O.)

His sperm was inside her.

BITSEY

His prints were all over the kitchen,

including one on the bag.

ZACK

Half-a-thumb print.

BITSEY

Okay, half-a-thumb print.

ZACK

Could have touched it before it was

a murder weapon.

BITSEY

Do you fondle your friends' garbage

bags?

ZACK

Yeah, I get very touchy around

household plastics. 'Hello, everybody --

ooooh, Tupperware.' Chill. I'm just

saying the bag could have been out

on the counter or something.

BITSEY

Hey, Zack?

ZACK

Yeah.

BITSEY

He did it.

ZACK

But the murder's way too fucking

clumsy. And this guy's a major

intellectual. Top of his Yale class,

a Rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two

books. He's an academic stud.

BITSEY

And, empirically speaking, a

psychotic.

ZACK

Look at his wife, she's a regular

Grace Kelly. Old money svelte. Father

was Ambassador to Spain --

BITSEY

(looking at the car's

instrument panel)

Shit! The light's on again.

ZACK

Ignore it. It's a rental.

BITSEY

Thanks, Zack. Do you smell anything?

ZACK

No. Besides the guy's a flaming

liberal.

BITSEY

A person's politics has nothing to

do with their propensity to commit

crime.

(beat)

Aren't we supposed to smell it if

it's overheating?

ZACK

Wrong, seventy-three percent of all

serial killers vote republican.

BITSEY

Throw the cigarette out so we can

smell.

BITSEY

No! You'll stink up the car. Throw

it out!

ZACK

I'm not gonna fucking pollute.

BITSEY

Zack!

BITSEY

We better pull off. Shit, this is so

irritating.

ZACK

How far to Huntsville?

BITSEY

Look.

ZACK

('Hard Copy'

announcer's voice)

'NEWS Magazine reporters Bitsy Bloom

and Zack Stemmons entered the rest

area with car trouble...

ZACK (V.O.)

Little did they know their troubles

were just beginning.

BITSEY

Is it hot?

ZACK

Oww! Jesus, yes. Isn't it always?

ZACK

So what do I do?

BITSEY

I don't know, something male.

ZACK

Now what?

BITSEY

Company.

ZACK

I hope whoever it is never saw

Deliverance.

OLDER COWBOY

You folks need some help?

BITSEY

Actually yes.

HOSTESS

How are you this morning?

BITSEY

Little early, isn't it?

ZACK

The non-smoking section's over there.

BITSEY

I meant the book.

ZACK

Oh.

BITSEY

What time is it?

ZACK

9:15. The waitress says the Ellis

Unit is about fifteen minutes out of

town, so we've got like five and

half hours. I --

BITSEY

Never eat where the menus have

pictures of the food.

ZACK

I was thinking we should drive to

Austin, check out the crime scene.

Could be some story stuff for us.

BITSEY

(without looking up)

First, this isn't a story. It's an

interview. We come, I listen, you

watch, we go home. Second, there is

no 'us' in the assignment.

ZACK

Okay, what do I watch you do for the

next five hours?

BITSEY

(closing the menu)

Drive around looking for decent

restaurant.

ZACK

You know, your reputation as Siberian-

Female-Dog-Person doesn't do you

justice.

BITSEY

My reputation got us invited here. I

play by the rules. It's called

objectivity.

ZACK

So where do we report?

GROVER

Well, I don't rightly know one

fraternity from another. But if we

catch any those boys out here again,

we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute...

You do that, Susan... Bye now.

GROVER

(to the Woman)

Thank you, Margie.

(turning to Bitsey

and Zack)

Correspondents Bloom and Stevens I

presume.

BITSEY

Yes, hello.

ZACK

Stemmons.

GROVER

Stemmons. Sorry, won't happen again.

I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C. community

relations.

MARGIE (WOMAN)

He's usually real good with names.

GROVER

(to Bitsey)

And these days I always like to ask,

now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.?

BITSEY

Bitsey.

GROVER

Bitsey it is. Margie, I'm stealin'

your umbrella.

MARGIE

Okey dokey.

GROVER

Bitsey, you ever been in a prison?

BITSEY

Yes.

GROVER

On death row?

BITSEY

No.

GROVER

Well, we house 422 inmates here.

Average stay with us is nine years.

Some get commuted, move on, most get

killed. It'll put you off your supper,

but then it's supposed to.

GROVER

(to the guard)

Afternoon, Earl.

(back to her)

We've got three concerns here: safety,

safety and safety. The visitation

area is entirely secure -- we just

ask you don't touch the glass. Windex

gets expensive.

GROVER

Rules say seven days prior to

execution inmates must be interviewed

in a cage.

GROVER

This changes for no man. You're not

carryin' a weapon are you?

BITSEY

No.

GROVER

Mr. Stemmons, you packin'?

ZACK

No, sir.

GROVER

(to the guards)

Clarence. Karla. New York guests for

Mr. Gale.

CLARENCE (GUARD)

May I see your purse, ma'am.

GROVER

(to Bitsey, indicating

the metal detector)

Go on and walk through.

GROVER

Now, should any kinda of

unpleasantness occur in the visitation

area, we ask that you stay put. Come

on through, Mr. Stemmons. And please

follow the instructions of these

fine correctional officers should

they see fit to give you any.

CLARENCE

(handing her the purse)

Here you go, ma'am.

GROVER

Anythin' you say can be overheard.

GROVER

Here we are.

GROVER

(calling out to Belyeu)

All yours, Mr. Belyeu.

(to Bitsey and Zack)

You folks have safe visit now.

BITSEY

Thank you.

BELYEU

Miss Bloom?

BITSEY

Yes.

BELYEU

Did that P.R. man validate your

parkin'?

BITSEY

He said the gift shop could do it.

BELYEU

(to David)

She's a smart one.

BELYEU

Benjamin Belyeu, Mr. Gale's attorney.

BITSEY

This is Zack.

BELYEU

Pleasure.

(turning)

And this is the man of the hour.

GUARD (V.O.)

Sit down, Gale.

DAVID

Hello.

BITSEY

Hello.

ZACK

Hi.

BELYEU

Now, why can't they turn that thing

down?

DAVID

(to the microphone

above him)

My lawyer respectfully suggests you

adjust the speaker-system volume.

DAVID

They're practicing being cruel and

unusual.

BELYEU

Mrs. Bloom, I'm sure you're a bitin'

at the bit.

BELYEU

Now, it is our understanding that

you are to have three two-hour

sessions. Today, tomorrow and

Thursday, all at three in the P.M.

I'm sorry we can't afford you more

time, but contrary to popular rumor

we have not yet begun to fight.

Furthermore, it's our understanding

that you will do this with no

recording equipment of any kind.

(to David)

You have my Gregg book?

DAVID

I need it for Billy's appeal.

BELYEU

(to Bitsey)

My client's got a ten pound bass on

the line and he's worried about

baitin' his neighbor's hook.

(takes out his planner)

Now, I have some papers for which I

need your Jo Ann Hancock.

(handing her a business

card)

Come by my Austin office at your

earliest convenience. Thursday

mornin', say.

BELYEU

Fine, till Thursday then.

BELYEU

Good luck, Miss Bloom.

(to David)

I'll come by later. We can play a

game of hangman, take up smokin'.

BELYEU

Bye, ya' all.

BITSEY

So...

DAVID

Sorry. Have a seat.

BITSEY

He's a character.

DAVID

Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met

the summer after 4th grade, spent

the day burning ants with his dad's

magnifying glass. We called it playing

'Execution.'

DAVID

Since I grew up in foster homes,

he's become the only family I have.

BITSEY

Where's your ex-wife?

DAVID

We agreed minimal contact would be

easier. Please don't mention her, or

my son.

BITSEY

All right. Anything else, just clearly

say, 'off the record.' I'll take it

to my grave. But then you know that

about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be

here.

BITSEY

(referring to the pen)

Is this recording equipment?

DAVID

How should we start?

BITSEY

I'd say you're a man with a story to

tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the

magazine, the format. You chose me.

BITSEY

Go.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DAVID

Think. What do you fantasize about?

World peace?

(as no one responds)

Thought so.

(light laughter)

Money-Fame-Ferrari?

(as some guys applaud

loudly; others then

boo them)

A Pulitzer? Nobel? M.T.V. Music Award?

(applause)

A genius hunk -- ostensibly bad but

secretly simmering with noble

passions, and willing to sleep on

the wet spot?

LARGE WOMAN

(yells)

I'll take two!

DAVID

A Victoria's Secret model -- just

slumming between law school and

running her family's Vastly Endowed

Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed

Children?

DAVID

Okay, good, you see Lucan's point.

Fantasies must be unrealistic. The

minute you get something, you don't,

you can't, want it anymore. To exist,

desire needs absent objects. So desire

supports itself with crazy

fantasies...

STUDENT

Sorry.

DAVID

This is what Pascal means when he

says the only time we're truly happy

is when day-dreaming about future

happiness.

DAVID

Or why we say, 'The hunt is sweeter

than the kill' or 'Be careful what

you wish for.'

DAVID (O.S.)

Not because you'll get it, but because

you're doomed not to want it if you

do. Think about it next time you're

at a wedding.

BERLIN (SEXY STUDENT)

Sorry about being late. There was,

you know, a thing.

DAVID

There usually is, Berlin.

BERLIN

Look, I know I'm not doing well.

BERLIN

And to torture a cliche, I'd do

anything to pass.

BERLIN

Anything, Professor Gale.

DAVID

Anything, huh?

BERLIN

(suggestively)

Anything.

DAVID

(the smile)

Anything?

BERLIN

Any thing.

DAVID

Tell you what, I'll give you good

grade, a really good grade, if you

will...

(leans down to her

ear, whispers

sensually)

...study.

CONSTANCE

David!

DAVID

Hey.

CONSTANCE

The T.A. finished transcribing the

Governor's radio and TV comments.

Listen: 'I hate killing, that's why

I'm willing to kill to stop it.' The

woman breathes in soundbites.

DAVID

(pretends to read a

quote)

'Yes, Virginia, the people of this

State have overwhelmingly affirmed

the reality of Santa.'

CONSTANCE

You might can use some of her pre-

centrist stuff.

DAVID

Tell me again why you aren't doing

the debate.

CONSTANCE

Telegenics. You have a cuter butt.

DAVID

I hadn't noticed.

CONSTANCE

I know.

DAVID

That's not what I meant.

CONSTANCE

She's gonna do the whole mother thing.

She empathizes with you completely,

but experience has given her the

courage to take the tougher road, ta-

da, ta-da. Keep it rational. And

flirt politely.

DAVID

'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for

a woman who executed thirty eight

last year.'

CONSTANCE

And watch your ego. Don't come across

as one of those I-hate-authority-

because-nobody-in-charge-reads-the-

New Yorker types.

DAVID

Anything else?

CONSTANCE

Yeah, don't fall into one of your

brooding silences. Oh, I'm getting

new federal stats from Amnesty

tonight.

DAVID

I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them

to Sharon's number at the house.

CONSTANCE

If you have a hang-over tomorrow --

DAVID

(hangs up, walking

away)

Apropos playing Mother.

CONSTANCE

(calling after him)

Ten o'clock!

(beat)

Bright-eyed and bushy tailed!

DAVID

Did you mark your calendar?

CHASE

(looking up at it)

Yep.

CHASE

(counting on his

fingers)

Only... three more Spain days.

DAVID

Only three. That's great, huh?

DAVID

What's he doing in here?

CHASE

Mommy said I could. Just till she

gets back.

(touching the spear)

That's a special-duper monster laser

knife.

DAVID

Where's your laser gun?

CHASE

Here.

CHASE

Tussshh, tusssshh, tussshh. I never

shoot them in the eyes, Daddy.

DAVID

That's 'cause you're a special-duper-

super-quadruper boy. Who's now going

to sleep.

DAVID

Who loves you?

DAVID

Ooooh.

(kissing him)

Good night, son.

CHASE

(holding up his stuffed

sheep)

Do Cloud Dog.

DAVID

(kissing the sheep)

Good night, Cloud Dog.

DAVID

Back before midnight.

BABYSITTER

It's cool, Mr. Gale.

(calling after him)

Don't do anything I wouldn't.

DAVID (O.S.)

Rest assured.

GREER

The guy's the Immanuel Kant of the

N.F.L. Consistent, accurate,

effective, and boring, boring, boring.

DAVID

Meinen Herren.

ROSS

(has an Oxford accent)

Hello, David.

OLDER PROFESSOR

Professor Gale. Where's your better

half?

DAVID

Spain.

OLDER PROFESSOR

Again?

(a beat)

Well, I was just off for air.

DAVID

(under his breath)

Looks like Sharon's affair is an

open secret.

ROSS

(under his breath)

Hermeneutical bias: the only fun

truths are the ones someone's trying

to hide.

(normal tone)

Have a seat.

ROSS

Listen, Berlin's here -- and livid.

Probations suspended her. She received

the letter today, took the opportunity

to throw a fit in my office. You

should --

BERLIN (O.S.)

Talking about me?

DAVID

Yep.

BERLIN

(to David)

He tell you I said when you were

circumcised they threw away the wrong

part.

DAVID

He mentioned it.

DAVID

It's called schmuck.

BERLIN

What?

DAVID

The part of the foreskin that gets

thrown away. I think it's called

schmuck.

BERLIN

Aren't we so fucking clever.

ROSS

(standing, escaping)

I suppose I should get us another.

David?

DAVID

Black Bush.

BERLIN

You were a jerk this afternoon.

DAVID

For what it's worth, I didn't know

about the suspension.

BERLIN

Is that supposed to be an apology?

DAVID

More like a conciliation.

ROSS

(slurring a bit)

All right.

(clears his throat)

As the poets have mournfully sung,

Death takes the innocent young, The

screamingly funny, The rolling in

money, And those who are very well

hung.

DAVID

(feeling good but

very much in control)

There once was a lesbian from Canjuom,

Who took a young man to her room,

And they argued all night, As to who

had the right, To do what, how, and

to whom.

BERLIN

One more. C'mon, one more.

DAVID

Enough. That's enough.

ROSS

Do you bow to the Queen?

DAVID

I'm done.

BERLIN

I'm not a student anymore.

DAVID

Don't think I want to know what that

means.

BERLIN

There once was woman named Berlin,

Who liked a bit now and again. Not

now and again, But Now! And Again!

And Again! And Again! And Again!

BERLIN

Cute, huh?

DAVID

Cute.

BERLIN

I have a secret. But I have to come

over there to tell you.

BERLIN

Here I come.

BERLIN

(whispering)

I wasn't after the grade.

DAVID

Berlin, this, this is not...

BERLIN

Ssshhhh.

BERLIN

We'll just talk, analyze, contemplate.

Or... you can put your mouth on my

body.

BERLIN

(softly, vulnerably)

Don't reject me. Please.

BERLIN

Rip them.

DAVID

What?

BERLIN

Rip them off.

BERLIN

No. From behind.

BERLIN

Yes.

BERLIN

Do it hard.

BERLIN

Harder.

BERLIN

Harder.

BERLIN

Yes.

BERLIN

Bite me. Bite my shoulder.

SMASH CUT TO:

FADE TO:

CONSTANCE

Okay, let's say we find an innocent

on death row. Wouldn't matter.

Corrections would let him go. Governor

Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks

to the good people at DeathWatch,

the system works.' Yeah, if they

executed an innocent, and we had

absolute, undeniable, in-your-face

proof, we could demand abolition.

Just like happened in England. Are

you okay?

DAVID

(coming out of it)

Sorry. Yeah.

CONSTANCE

But it hasn't happened, not since

'76. And won't happen.

CONSTANCE

Dead men can't make a case.

DAVID

And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count.

CONSTANCE

Just keep it rational. The death

penalty is expensive and ineffective.

No one wants to see a murderer as a

victim.

DAVID

Um-hum.

CONSTANCE

And stop that.

DAVID

What?

CONSTANCE

Active listening. I hate active

listeners. Makes me feel like I'm

with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares

more about appearing to listen than

actually listening. Did you bring

the Amnesty fax?

DAVID

I can listen and appear to listen at

the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I

left it home.

CONSTANCE

I have a copy.

CONSTANCE

You want to tell me what's up.

DAVID

Nothing. Everything. Something

profoundly stupid happened last night.

CONSTANCE

(teasing)

I hope you used a condom.

CONSTANCE

Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of

yours?

DAVID

It was Berlin.

CONSTANCE

Oh, that's great, great. I can hear

the grapevine now. They suspended

her so Gale could dick her with a

clear conscience.

CONSTANCE

A power differential equals coercion.

Great. You are so weak.

DAVID

Constance, you're not my wife. Thank

God.

CONSTANCE

I know you can tell yourself it's a

position I aspire to, but believe

me, I would rather...

DAVID

I didn't mean --

CONSTANCE

Let's go.

DAVID

Are you okay?

CONSTANCE

Yes, let's just go.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

In three, two...

HOST

(to camera)

Welcome back to 'Batter's Box.'

Tonight we continue our very special

four-part series with the Governor

Hardin. Arguing capital punishment

with her is DeathWatch coordinator,

Professor David Gale. Governor, you're

up.

GOVERNOR HARDIN

Alan, let me say somethin' I always

say.

GOVERNOR HARDIN

And I'm gonna keep on sayin.' And

that is I hate killin.' That's why

my administration is willing to kill

to stop it.

DAVID

So you don't subscribe to the idea

that 'a good state is one that

protects its most despised members'?

GOVERNOR HARDIN

It's a nice liberal idea, but like

most nice liberal ideas, naive.

DAVID

It's a quote from you, Governor,

from your first state attorney

campaign.

GOVERNOR HARDIN

You've got me, Professor. But let

me, in my defense, give you a quote.

Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a

liberal at twenty, you've got no

heart, if you're still a liberal at

thirty, you've got no brain.'

DAVID

So, basically you feel, to choose

another quote, 'society must be

cleansed of elements which represent

its own death.'

GOVERNOR HARDIN

Well, yes. I would have to agree.

(chuckles again)

Did I say that, too?

DAVID

No, ma'am. That was Hitler.

DAVID

Governor, can't we examine the

possibility that capital punishment

isn't working. That murderers aren't

deterred by the law because they

have about as much forethought as

lemmings. That it's expensive,

inequably administered, that...

DAVID

...that we may even be killing

innocents.

GOVERNOR HARDIN

All righty, Mr. Gale, I'll play your

game. Name one. Name one innocent

man Texas has put to death in my

tenure. One.

GOVERNOR HARDIN

Name one in the last twenty years.

In any state in this country.

HOST

Well, Mr. Gale?

DAVID

Dead men can't make a case.

GOVERNOR HARDIN

Well, as my daddy used to say: If

you can't find a problem, there

probably isn't one.

GOVERNOR HARDIN

Well, you certainly had me on that

Hitler quote.

DAVID

Thank you, Governor.

GOVERNOR HARDIN

These debates are awfully good for

the state, don't you think?

DAVID

Of course.

GOVERNOR HARDIN

Well, I've got to buzz.

GOVERNOR HARDIN

You folks keep up the good work. We

need that opposition.

CONSTANCE

Your exact words were, 'Just tell me

when my ego gets in the way of the

work.' Now I'm telling you: Your

ego's in the way of work.

DAVID

(indicating the station)

Look, I wanted you to do this anyway.

CONSTANCE

You put up precisely two seconds of

protest at the thought of a televised

debate.

DAVID

What's that supposed to mean?

CONSTANCE

It means DeathWatch suffers because

you're so anxious to finger authority,

to publicly prove that David Gale is

so much fucking smarter than the

powers that be. Learn to work without

an audience. Try squeezing money

from the donor list. Have you ever

licked one single mail-out envelope?

MAN #2 (SUIT)

Mr. Gale?

DAVID

Look, guys, there's not much more to

say --

MAN #2

Rameriz, Austin police. This is

Officer Haslinger.

DAVID

What, arguing with the Governor is a

crime?

MAN #3 (SUIT)

No, sir, rape is.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

GUARD (V.O.)

(over the loudspeaker)

Gale, time's up.

DAVID

Berlin had my bite marks, bruises,

ripped clothing. My skin was beneath

her nails. It didn't look like

anything but rape. Two days later

she called the D.A., said she wouldn't

testify, too drunk to be sure, etc.

On the plane home, Sharon read about

her husband's rape case being dropped.

BITSEY

Why'd she do it?

DAVID

(shrugs)

Finger authority, show she was smarter

than the powers that be.

BITSEY

Do you know where I can find her?

DAVID

First year in here I received a card

postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't

signed, but I suspect it was from

her -- the front had the text 'Sex

is Power.'

BITSEY

Anything written on it?

DAVID

Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you

can know.'

(exiting the cage)

See you tomorrow, Ms. Bloom.

BITSEY

Try phone records, a net search.

ZACK

Fucking better than watching you

work.

ZACK

You think he's telling the truth?

BITSEY

Don't ask me that. I don't know.

There is no truth, only perspectives.

ZACK

Can't say that. If you say 'there is

no truth,' you're claiming it's true

that there is no truth -- it's a

logical contradiction.

BITSEY

Working on our philosophy merit badge,

Zack?

ZACK

I, on the other hand, think Gale's

telling the truth.

BITSEY

This you know telepathically?

ZACK

It's just my perspective.

ZACK

Thirty-three o what?

BITSEY

Seven.

(then)

'Check out the crime scene in Austin.'

You made it sound so close. Shit,

two and half hours and that damn lig --

ZACK

Bitsey.

BITSEY

Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom and this is

Zack Stemmons. We --

GOTH GIRL

You want the tour?

BITSEY

Uh, yes.

GOTH GIRL

There's a twenty-dollar mandatory

donation, apiece. But you get a re-

enactment photo packet. It's got

five pictures.

BITSEY

Okay.

GOTH GIRL

I gotta collect first.

BITSEY

Oh, sure.

GOTH GIRL

You gotta sign the book. Doesn't

have to be your real name, though.

GOTH GIRL

First page says you're here to do

research on violent crime. The state

requires it for nonprofit shit.

GOTH GIRL

Take a re-enactment photo packet.

GOTH GIRL

If you guys could share one, it would

be really cool. The butt wipes where

I do prints kinda jerk my chain.

GOTH GIRL

That's me. My boyfriend took it. We

also did a video. It's fifty bucks

'cause you can see my tits. There's

a version without tits, that's thirty-

five.

BITSEY

Do many people take the tour?

GOTH GIRL

Not so much anymore. We thought this

would be like a busy week -- Gale

gettin' the prune juice and all.

Prune juice is what death row dudes

call the poison, 'cause it gives you

the shits. Most jerks just take a

photo from the street. They shot a

'Real Crimes' episode here, but the

owner didn't give us dick.

ZACK

You don't mind living here?

GOTH GIRL

I'm cool with ghouls. Beats livin'

with my dickwad parents. It starts

over here.

GOTH GIRL

She let him crash here sometimes. He

was like constantly wasted. Drank

Black Label religiously.

GOTH GIRL

This is where the tripod was. My

boyfriend borrowed the one we usually

show folks. They never found a camera,

photos, or videos or anything. Gale

must have buried them. These serial

killer dudes take photos to whack

off to later.

ZACK

He's not exactly a serial killer.

GOTH GIRL

Whatever.

GOTH GIRL

She was like totally naked right

here. The meter man saw her through

the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped

her mouth, then taped a bag over her

head so she couldn't breathe. My

boyfriend says that's probably when

he fucked her. Your muscles tense up

when you die -- the sex is better.

(pointing)

He used those housewife gloves so he

wouldn't leave prints. They found

sticky stuff from the tape on them.

GOTH GIRL

We ask folks not to touch the exhibit.

ZACK

Right.

GOTH GIRL

The totally sick part was where they

found the key --

BITSEY

We know, you can save that.

ZACK

What? Where was it?

GOTH GIRL

It was in her stomach, dude. He made

her swallow it before he bagged her.

GOTH GIRL

That's pretty much the highlight.

BITSEY

It was in the case file.

ZACK

Fuck, in her stomach? That's colder

than Wisconsin.

BITSEY

(looking in the

rearview mirror)

Zack, open your vanity.

ZACK

What?

BITSEY

The vanity mirror, pull it down.

BITSEY

See that truck behind us?

ZACK

Yeah.

BITSEY

Isn't that the cowboy from the rest

area?

ZACK

Same truck.

BITSEY

Weird coincidence, huh?

ZACK

(turning)

Coincidences are always weird, that's

why they're coincidences.

DAVID

Off-the-record?

BITSEY

Alright, we're off.

DAVID

Constance was murdered with what's

called the Securitat Method. You're

hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the

key, taped at the mouth, a bag's

sealed over your head and you're

left to suffocate. The Securitat did

this to Romanians who wouldn't inform

or confess. Sometimes the bag was

ripped off at the last second, you

got a second chance. If not, you die

knowing the 'key' to your freedom

was inside you the whole time. A

cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem

is I mentioned the method in an early

article. The prosecution never knew.

BITSEY

You're telling me someone's framing

you?

DAVID

It's more than that.

DAVID

There was a tripod.

BITSEY

Right, facing her body. Are we on?

DAVID

(nods agreement)

Not a single print was found on it.

Someone brought it, wiped it, left

it. Why? It's as if they wanted me

to know that somewhere there's a

record of what really happened that

afternoon. As if they wanted me to

die knowing the key to my freedom

was... out there.

BITSEY

Maybe you're being paranoid?

DAVID

Ms. Bloom. I'm an anti-death row

activist on death row. Doesn't that

strike you as odd?

BITSEY

Any ideas who 'they' are?

DAVID

No.

DAVID

But I have someone on it, someone

I'm hoping will one day find an

answer.

BITSEY

Belyeu's hired a detective?

DAVID

A journalist.

DAVID

(mimicking Belyeu)

'She's a smart one.'

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CONSTANCE

I'll drop by your office after.

CHASE

Wear me like a fur, Daddy! Wear me

DAVID

Who's your hero?

DAVID

Call me when you get to Boston?

SHARON (WIFE)

Yeah.

DAVID

I wish you --

SHARON

Don't.

SHARON

Chase, get in, Sweetie.

CHASE

(turning to his dad)

See ya later, Alli-gator.

DAVID

After awhile, Crocodile.

CHASE

Take it easy, Japa-ne-se.

DAVID

Okey-dokey, Artichokey.

SHARON

(to Chase)

Scoot.

SHARON

I sent you an e-mail.

DAVID

Okay?

SHARON

Just read it.

SHARON

(cracking her window)

Come on, Chase.

CONSTANCE

You could at least hide the bottle.

DAVID

Well?

CONSTANCE

Officially, you're on sabbatical.

Unofficially, they want you to look

for another position. It was four to

two.

DAVID

How did Ross vote?

CONSTANCE

You're not supp... Against you.

DAVID

And you?

CONSTANCE

Against my politics.

DAVID

So, I wanted to get your feedback on

the idea.

IVY LEAGUER

Look, Professor Gale, I could sit

here, as I'm sure others have, and

plead departmental cutbacks. Claim

you need more publications, or I

need a minority, whatever. All bull-

geschichte. Your record's brilliant.

You're an original voice worth -- in

the scarcity-defines-value capitalist

system under which we toil -- your

weight in gold. Hell, it's not even

the alcohol. It'd be nice to have

faculty whose crutch wasn't Prozac.

But, to speak plainly, if I hire

you, in the eyes of the regents,

alumni and every freshman with an

ear for gossip, I'd be hiring a

rapist.

IVY LEAGUER

You're not politically correct, Dr.

Gale. Welcome to the club.

CHASE (V.O.)

(on his mom's answering

machine)

We aren't home. Please, tell us a

message.

SHARON (V.O.)

CHASE (V.O.)

SORORITY PLEDGE

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

What exactly attracts you to the

bond market?

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

Mr. Gale?

YUPPIE MAN

(over-articulating)

Now, Mr. Gale, I want you to tell me

three personal qualities you have

that would make you a successful

Radio Shack manager.

BELYEU

Because divorce proceedings do not

require her presence in the country.

For a custody hearin', yeah, she'll

have to return.

BELYEU

But without successful completion of

an alcohol treatment program, you'll

be lucky to get the odd Thanksgivin'.

DAVID

So my chances of getting partial

custody aren't good?

BELYEU

Roughly the same as you sinkin' that

from here.

FADE TO:

CONSTANCE

I'm sorry.

CONSTANCE

You look good.

DAVID

I feel... washed.

CONSTANCE

(lightly, in his arms)

I need you. DeathWatch needs you,

now more than ever.

DAVID

Nothing like I need you, both. You're

all I have.

CONSTANCE

Look.

CONSTANCE

Jo Ann Johnson's been re-scheduled.

CONSTANCE

I've got a call with Hawkins tonight,

and if national will commit emergency

funds...

DAVID

Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll

only prove the system works.

CONSTANCE

But I'll save a life.

DAVID

(referring to the

bruises)

Where'd you get those?

CONSTANCE

Spring cleaning.

CONSTANCE

She went up at 18, she's 26 now.

DAVID

(calling to the Cowboy)

Hey! She ever not make you work when

you come by?

OLDER COWBOY

(raising his spade in

greeting)

Mornin', David.

DAVID

(turning to Constance)

What's her story?

CONSTANCE

I really want us to get behind this

one. She's articul --

DAVID

Constance, who did she kill?

CONSTANCE

A cop.

DAVID

She admit to it?

DAVID

You're a crazy woman. Not your medium

grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's-

bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose-

screws-in-the-belfry insane.

CONSTANCE

You're mixing metaphors.

DAVID

A real danger to flora and fauna.

CONSTANCE

Are we gonna do this?

DAVID

(the smile)

And how.

DAVID

You're burning up.

COLLEGE GUY

(calling from beneath

a desk)

Howdy, Mr. Gale.

DAVID

Hello, folks.

MATRON

Hello. My, this is service. Thank

you.

DAVID

Gladly.

DAVID

Latte on your left, partner.

DIRECTOR (V.O.)

...and see what kind of resources

the religious groups can deliver.

CONSTANCE

I'm sure we can get some pulpit time,

maybe cable.

DIRECTOR (V.O.)

Cable's good. Listen, I need to run.

For now, I agree the first press

release should focus on the woman's

youth.

DIRECTOR (V.O.)

I'll have the Washington people look

into counsel competency, though I'm

almost sure she's exhausted this

issue on appeal.

CONSTANCE

(to the phone)

John, David's going to --

DIRECTOR (V.O.)

Oh, I almost forgot. He's not around,

is he?

CONSTANCE

No.

DIRECTOR (V.O.)

Good, keep it that way. His

relationship to DeathWatch is over,

terminated. Last thing we need is

this rape thing coming back to bite

our butts.

DIRECTOR (V.O.)

These guys don't stay on the wagon

for very long.

DIRECTOR (V.O.)

I'm serious, Constance. Ban him from

the premises. I realize you two...

DAVID

Sharon, pick up. For once just pick

up the goddamn phone! If you keep

him in Spain, I'll... I'm begging

you. He's my son! Please! Please....

Please.

DAVID

We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge.

CONSTANCE

Come on, come inside.

DAVID

We fell off our wagon.

DAVID

Know why Saint Jude is the patron

saint of lost causes? 'Cause his

real name was Judas. There were two

Judases, Judai, the saint guy and

the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus,

and tried to kiss him. Medievalers

wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear

of getting bad Judas on the line by

mistake. Ergo, they only gave him

business when really desperate. That's

why. Then they changed his name.

DAVID

Constance?

DAVID

Your mail's blowing.

DOCTOR

How we doing?

DAVID

Fine. How's Constance?

DOCTOR

Sleeping.

DOCTOR

Mr. Gale, a leukemia patient's

condition is highly susceptible to

external stress. While we don't want

to totally restrict Constance's life --

DAVID

What?

DOCTOR

Constance's illness requires a degree

of regularity.

DAVID

Constance has leukemia?

DOCTOR

Acute. She was diagnosed last fall.

DOCTOR

Have I created a problem?

DAVID

No, no.

GUARD (V.O.)

Gale, time's up.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DAVID

When I asked why she hadn't told me,

she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess

she figured as long as death was

chasing her, she could help others

escape.

DAVID

Constance left the world better than

she found it.

(beat)

It's a small, difficult thing.

ZACK

Fuck.

ZACK

Hey.

BITSEY

(waving her hand at

the smoke)

For God's sake, Zack.

ZACK

You're not a happy camper.

BITSEY

It's not a happy place.

ZACK

Talked to the Austin prosecutor.

Belyeu's a yokel. Prosecutor says he

fucked up the penalty phase, says

Gale probably would have gotten life

on mitigating factors. Gale stuck

with him, though, all through appeals,

despite major pro bono offers.

BITSEY

What else?

ZACK

Notta on Berlin, we pick up the money

in Houston tonight, overheat light

came on twice, and you're about to

get a surprise.

BITSEY

I don't want a surprise.

ZACK

(pointing ahead)

Too late.

ZACK

This is mostly an Oklahoma caravan.

I got stuck behind them on the way

in.

ZACK

Execution's not for another 36 hours.

It's gonna be a zoo. There's the

P.R. guy.

BITSEY

What a life, waiting around for

someone to die.

ZACK

Fuck, look.

BITSEY

This is a little too coincidental.

ZACK

'Cause I couldn't see the license

plate.

BITSEY

Forget it. What time is it?

ZACK

6:05. Why don't you have a watch?

BITSEY

It's a long story.

BITSEY

Give me an hour.

BITSEY

Zack!

ZACK

What!?

BITSEY

It's open.

ZACK

So? Maybe the maid forgot.

BITSEY

(pointing)

Look!

ZACK

I'll check the bathroom.

ZACK

Clear in here! Don't touch it!

ZACK

Fuck, Bitsey, there could have been

prints.

BITSEY

Look.

ZACK

She says no one asked for you. And

all the room keys are different.

ZACK

Just she and her husband have masters.

BITSEY

What did you tell her?

ZACK

That you have a jealous boyfriend.

BITSEY

Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?

ZACK

She didn't ask. I think she assumed

it had something to do with why he

was jealous. I still say we should

do this in my room -- this one's a

fucking crime scene.

BITSEY

Whoever got in here -- without a key

in broad daylight -- was probably

smart enough not to leave prints. I

have the remote.

ZACK

Maybe they could look for D.N.A. Try

three.

BITSEY

(hitting the remote)

They don't look for D.N.A. when

someone breaks in to deliver, Zack.

Here.

ZACK

You sure you want to see what's on

here?

BITSEY

No. Start it.

BITSEY

I hope this isn't what I think it

is.

BITSEY (O.S.)

God, no.

ZACK (O.S.)

Fuck. Is it her?

BITSEY (O.S.)

Turn it up.

ZACK

Belyeu says to bring the tape first

thing tomorrow. Also said you were

right about not calling the police.

ZACK

Are you gonna be okay?

ZACK

Let's say Gale's right. Some sick-

fuck-Agatha Christie-wannabe set him

up, arranged like the perfect murder.

Why send a magazine journalist proof

a few hours before he's won? Doesn't

make sense.

BITSEY

No, it's perfect. He knows News

Magazine won't give the scoop to the

dailies or nightly news, not after

having paid for it. Probably guessed

we wouldn't call the cops. And, most

importantly, knows I'll tell Gale

tomorrow.

ZACK

Why does he give a shit?

BITSEY

Zack, what if Harraway's murder was

just a means to getting Gale. I mean

sending him through hell, a sick cat

and mouse game. You kill the one

person he has left. Make sure he

sits six years on death row for the

murder -- a place he's made a public

career of loathing. And then just

let him die, die knowing everyone

will remember him with disgust. You

destroy his loved ones, his life's

work, his memory -- and you make him

watch.

ZACK

That's a lot of hate. You're talking

beyond sadism.

ZACK

Then why release it?

BITSEY

If the mouse dies the game's over.

Maybe the cat's enjoying himself.

Or...

ZACK

Or?

BITSEY

(picks up the tape)

Imagine walking to the chamber knowing

this exists.

ZACK

The 'cat' is a fucking psychopath.

BITSEY

Yeah, but smart.

ZACK

Why do they call it check-book

journalism if we always pay cash?

ZACK

Woa, woa. Sadist at six o'clock!

BITSEY

Is it the truck?

ZACK

Yep, and doing a lousy job of hiding.

ZACK

He must think we're idiots. You think

he's our fucked-up feline?

BITSEY

Is he gaining?

ZACK

No. Just sitting back there.

BITSEY

Can you see the license?

ZACK

Too much mist. What the fuck does

this guy want?

BELYEU (O.S.)

Fine. Oh, and bring in Miss Bloom's

original when that's done.

(entering, to Bitsey)

Don't blame you for not watching

that twice.

BITSEY

I couldn't sleep afterwards.

BELYEU

I understand. I generally tell folks

I'm no more afraid of the grim reaper

than I am of a Presbyterian on

Mother's Day. But watching your

tape... well. I had to keep tellin'

myself 'that's not Constance' just

to get through.

(a beat)

Unfortunately, others may argue the

same.

BITSEY

Yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her

house.

BELYEU

Currently home to Weirdos

Incorporated. Arguably, that tape

could have been made by anybody with

twenty dollars and a tolerance for

vulgarity.

BITSEY

But it will at least get us a

postponement?

BELYEU

I hope so, Miss Bloom, I certainly

hope so. But you've got to remember

that there's a machine a runnin'.

And come six o'clock tomorrow mornin'

that machine wants to be fed.

CLERK

All here, Mr. Belyeu.

BELYEU

(to the Clerk)

Thank you, Joshua.

(to Bitsey)

To add to our troubles, your own

credibility may come into question.

BITSEY

Why?

BELYEU

You've been fraternizin' with the

condemned. In the court's eyes, he's

the most likely candidate to have

put you onto the tape. He's a

persuasive man, you're a out-of-state

woman -- it don't look good on paper.

BITSEY

But someone put it in my hotel room.

BELYEU

A fact for which we have no evidence.

BELYEU

Thank you, Bobbi.

BITSEY

Thanks.

BELYEU

(standing)

Well, let's not start readin' Kafka

just yet. Could we find a sympathetic

judge. I'll file within the hour.

You headin' back over to Ellis?

BITSEY

(standing)

Yeah.

BELYEU

Fine. I'll call over at the motel

later and give you an update.

BITSEY

Shit.

BITSEY

Did you see the cowboy go in?

ZACK

He went in Belyeu's building?

BITSEY

Into his office. Just saw him.

ZACK

Fuck!

BITSEY

Follow him. Find out who he is, where

he lives -- what he --

ZACK

How are you gonna get to Ellis?

BITSEY

A taxi.

DAVID

Okay, okay. Calm down. You have to

sit.

GUARD (V.O.)

Visitors need to stay seated.

DAVID

(to the microphone

above)

Sorry.

(to Bitsey)

Look at me. He's not your man. His

name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch

Director before Constance. He's a

'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a

good demonstration has to end in a

riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs

don't mean shit.' They fired him.

Constance kept him in the

organization, and he loved her for

it. The man adored her.

BITSEY

Then why was he following us? Why

was he at Belyeu and Crane?

DAVID

He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U.

cases together, until Dusty punched

a clansman in a federal court. Benny

sometimes still gives him work,

probably had him follow you.

BITSEY

Why?

DAVID

To make sure you honored your

agreement, one for which there's no

contract.

BITSEY

He would've said something.

DAVID

He's a lawyer, Ms. Bloom.

BITSEY

Maybe Dusty was jealous because you

were seeing Constance.

DAVID

I wasn't 'seeing' Constance.

BITSEY

She died... she had your sperm --

DAVID

It's more complicated than that.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

CONSTANCE

All I can feel is envy.

CONSTANCE

Remember those Kubler-Ross stages,

the ones the dying go through?

DAVID

Denial, anger, bargaining, depression,

and acceptance. Where are you?

CONSTANCE

Denial.

DAVID

Denial's my personal favorite.

CONSTANCE

The whole idea of there being a

process makes me tired. I'm not up

to the job of Dying Person. Marveling

at blades of grass. Lecturing

strangers to relish every moment.

DAVID

Mending bridges.

CONSTANCE

Mending bridges. Confessing regrets.

Uuuggh.

DAVID

No regrets?

CONSTANCE

Nope.

CONSTANCE

Take that back. I wish I had a child.

DAVID

Me, too.

CONSTANCE

I'm sorry, David.

CONSTANCE

I guess I just wish I would have

risked more.

CONSTANCE

(making a face,

swallowing hard)

Uumm, also not enough sex. Should

have had more sex.

DAVID

How much... how many lovers have you

had?

CONSTANCE

Including college?

DAVID

Including college.

DAVID

Well, it's... not every... yeah, you

should have had more sex.

CONSTANCE

You work hard not to be seen as a

sex object. Before long, you're not

seen at all.

DAVID

I see you.

DAVID

Want to make it five? Finish the

hand?

CONSTANCE

A pity lay. No thanks.

DAVID

It wouldn't be pity.

DAVID

Are you okay?

CONSTANCE

Don't worry.

CONSTANCE

It's good.

CONSTANCE

Talk to me. Let me hear your voice.

DAVID

(in her ear)

I'm here. Happy. I'm very happy.

CONSTANCE

Hold me tight.

DAVID

I'm here.

CONSTANCE

Tight... I'm scared.

DAVID

It's okay.

DAVID

Okay.

CONSTANCE

Don't stop. Stay in me. Please stay

in me.

DAVID

Shhh. I'm staying.

CONSTANCE

I need to feel you inside.

DAVID

It's okay. I'm inside. I'm not pulling

out.

CONSTANCE

I'm so tired.

DAVID

I know, I know.

CONSTANCE

Tired of being afraid.

DAVID

Shhh.

CONSTANCE

Help me.

DAVID

I'm here. It's okay.

CONSTANCE

Help me. Please. Make it stop.

DAVID

Shhh. I'm here. I'm here.

CONSTANCE

How do you feel about last night?

DAVID

Rescued. You?

CONSTANCE

Like I have a reason to get out of

bed. Ironic, huh?

DAVID

Let's say they move back from Spain,

that I somehow got my one weekend a

month. Would it matter? By high

school, I'd be his weak spot, the

focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed

pride. In college there'd be late-

night angst: 'What if I turn out

like the old man?' Holidays would be

forced smiles and unscheduled exits.

I mean, what girl comes home with

you if there's talk that Pops is a

rapist?

DAVID

I can't stand the idea of being his

model of failure. Without him, I

drink. To cover the hole. To prove

to myself he's better off without

me.

DAVID

(standing)

Sorry, just leaving.

POLICEMAN (V.O.)

(a loudspeaker voice)

Gale, time's up.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

BITSEY

But there has to be someone. Someone

with a motive, who knew you both.

Someone who visited that morning.

DAVID

If I could answer... we wouldn't be

having this conversation. It's why I

need you, why I chose you. You have

my story, now...

(mimicking her delivery)

'Go.'

BITSEY

There's not enough time.

DAVID

You'll find time.

BITSEY

You know that's not what I meant.

You should have done this earlier.

DAVID

You're not here to save me. You're

here to save my son's memory of his

father -- that's all I want.

BITSEY

You're going to let them kill you.

DAVID

We live to stop death. Eating,

inventing, loving, praying, fighting,

killing -- choose a verb. All to

stall this evil, Job's 'king of

terrors.' But what do we really know

about it? Nobody comes back. There's

a point, when your mind out-lives

its obsessions, when your habits

survive your dreams, when your

losses... You wonder, maybe death is

a gift. All I know is that by this

time tomorrow, I'll be better off.

What I don't know is why.

(exits the cage)

Goodbye, Bitsey.

BITSEY

(softly)

Goodbye, David.

GUARD

Car's on its way. Wanna wait in here?

BITSEY

No thanks.

JOURNALIST #1

I got it. I got it. You could have

corporate sponsors. Volkswagen for

Bundy, Home Depot for Gacy. And 'The

David Gale Execution, brought to you

by...'

JOURNALIST #2

'...Hefty.'

BITSEY

What time is it?

ZACK

(checking his watch)

Nine hours, 52 minutes.

BITSEY

Belyeu!

BITSEY

Did you have Dusty Wright follow us?

BELYEU

I employ Mr. Wright from time to

time.

BITSEY

You could have said something.

BELYEU

(opening her umbrella)

That would have defeated the purpose.

Apologies if I caused you unnecessary

anxiety, but I'm paid to be

suspicious.

(handing it to her)

Thought I'd return this.

ZACK

Any word on the writ?

BELYEU

Denied. Tape went to a federal judge

two hours ago. Your videographer

friend made contact?

BITSEY

No.

BELYEU

What you got was definitely a snippet.

Could be he has more previews

scheduled. Best stick close to your

room.

BITSEY

How's David?

BELYEU

Holdin' up. I'm headed back over.

BITSEY

Tell him I'll take care of it, about

his son, I mean.

BELYEU

Will do. We'll talk later?

BELYEU

Watch yourselves.

BITSEY

(calling after him)

Mr. Belyeu.

BITSEY

Were Dusty and Constance close?

BELYEU

Thick as thieves.

BITSEY

(putting on her shoes)

Zack! Wake up! Get up!

BITSEY

Did you throw the towel on the floor?

ZACK

What?

BITSEY

The towel on my bathroom floor. Did

you put it there?

ZACK

Yeah, I guess. It's a hotel room.

What --

BITSEY

Do you do that at home?

ZACK

No. Fuck, Bitsey. I'm sorry, it's

not like it's --

BITSEY

Get up.

ZACK

(sitting up)

What the fuck's wrong with you?

BITSEY

Grab the T.V. I want to check

something.

ZACK

What?

BITSEY

We're taking a tour.

ZACK

Where?

BITSEY

Austin. Get the T.V.

BITSEY

Wanna make a hundred bucks?

GOTH GIRL

What do I gotta do?

BITSEY

We're going over the crime scene.

BITSEY

And for the next hour I want you to

do exactly what I say when I say to

do it. If I say suck Zack's dick,

all I want to hear from you is 'May

I swallow.'

GOTH GIRL

You want me to suck his dick?

ZACK

It's just a patriarchal figure of

speech.

BITSEY

Is your boyfriend here?

GOTH GIRL

He ain't exactly my boyfriend anymore.

BITSEY

Well is his video camera here?

GOTH GIRL

Yeah.

BITSEY

Get it.

GOTH GIRL

I gotta collect first.

ZACK (O.S.)

Move those index cards, too.

BITSEY

Zoom in a hair.

BITSEY

Put the gloves on a dish rack.

GOTH GIRL

I don't have one.

BITSEY

Turn them inside out.

BITSEY

Move the tape roll about a foot to

the left. And get rid of the

handcuffs.

BITSEY

Come check this, Zack.

(to the Goth Girl)

Could you... what's your name?

GOTH GIRL

Nico's cool.

BITSEY

Nico, lie down on the floor, facing

the counter.

ZACK

We can imagine that part.

(to Bitsey)

I'll position her.

BITSEY

That's fine. Just straighten her

legs.

BITSEY

What's this?

ZACK

Towel or something.

BITSEY

Okay, look at this.

BITSEY

I noticed this back at the hotel.

See?

BITSEY

She moves her foot. Why?

ZACK

Fucking good question.

BITSEY

It's another fifteen seconds before

she comes to. If she had passed out

once, without fresh air she wouldn't

come back. There was no head trauma,

her blood tested normal --

ZACK

Jesus, maybe she was faking, hoping

he would go away.

BITSEY

Or...

BITSEY

We've got to bag her.

ZACK

Woa. Not a good idea.

BITSEY

All right, I'll do it.

NICO

I found it.

BITSEY

(to Zack)

Okay, I want you to wait three minutes

before you take it off.

ZACK

Bitsey, I'm not so sure about this.

BITSEY

Three full minutes. Just stand behind

the tripod. Both of you.

BITSEY (O.S.)

(through the bag)

Have you started?

ZACK

Twenty-two seconds.

ZACK

Thirty seconds.

NICO

Fuckin' wicked.

ZACK

Thirty-five... Forty... Forty-five...

Fifty.

NICO

Maybe she shouldn't...

ZACK

Fifty-five... one minute... five...

ten... one-fifteen...

ZACK

Fuck. Twenty... twenty-five...

thirty...

NICO

This isn't cool.

ZACK

...thirty-five... Fuck... one-forty...

one-forty fi...

BITSEY

(through the bag)

Zack!

ZACK

(ripping at the tape)

Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey. You

okay? What if I'd've waited?

ZACK

No more fucking experiments, all

right? Just tell me what's going on.

You okay?

BITSEY

(still breathing

heavily)

She... she did it herself.

BITSEY

She used the gloves to keep

fingerprints off the tape and bag.

Then she put them back on the dish

rack, but upside down and inside

out, a housewives' habit. A murderer

would have just tossed them aside --

like they were the first time we

were here, like you do a towel in a

hotel.

ZACK

Maybe, all right, maybe.

(indicating the cuffs)

But why wear these?

BITSEY

They threw me. I forgot you have to

have the key to put them on. But she

needed them. She knew she would

instinctively try to rip the bag

off, that at some point automatism

would kick in.

NICO

Fuckin' A, like when people hang

themselves. At the last second they

go chicken, claw at the rope and

shit. The police find their own skin

beneath their nails.

BITSEY

And she swallowed the key so she

couldn't get to it. She made sure

there was no way out.

ZACK

Woa, chill, chill. Why not hang

yourself, or take pills. Why take

your fucking clothes off? Why make

it look like a murder?

BITSEY

It's so calculated. She's handcuffed,

taped at the mouth. The gloves. The

damn tripod.

ZACK

Why, Bitsey? Why fake your own murder?

BITSEY

I don't know.

ZACK

Motive's like a major issue here.

BITSEY

Thanks, Zack.

ZACK

It doesn't make sense. The woman's a

bleeding-heart abolitionist. Why

frame an innocent man? Why send Gale

to the chair for what looks --

BITSEY

What'd you say?

ZACK

She had to know some innocent fuck

would take the fall.

BITSEY

Oh my God, Zack, that's it! That's

why! To prove it happens. To have

absolute proof that the system

convicts innocents.

ZACK

Get the fuck out of here.

BITSEY

No, that's how she thought. She lived

for DeathWatch. If she's gonna die,

why not die for it? That's why the

tripod was here. To record proof,

undeniable proof, the tape. That's

why we got an out-take.

ZACK

A dead woman put the tape in your

room?

BITSEY

Of course not. She needed help,

someone to keep it, release it.

Someone she could trust, someone

dedicated to the cause...

ZACK

(mimicking Belyeu)

Thick as thieves.

ZACK

Hairy.

BITSEY

Come on.

BITSEY

...Because of the Berlin thing,

Constance knew the police would go

straight to Gale. In a way, he's

perfect. A high profile alcoholic

whose life was shit anyway. But...

ZACK

She was in love with him.

BITSEY

I don't know. Something. They were

close. She wouldn't want him dead.

BITSEY

Remember this thing about Dusty being

a bull-horner, going to far?

ZACK

Why he was fired from DeathWatch,

and the A.C.L.U.

BITSEY

Right. Maybe the plan was for Dusty

to release the tape after Gale's

conviction, after a year or so. You

know, force him to dry out, let him

play the heroic victim, give him

back his dignity. So, Dusty Wright's

sitting on this tape, waiting, the

only one who knows about it. And

maybe good ole Dusty starts to think

that an erroneous execution is a

hell of a lot more politically useful

than a last-minute save.

ZACK

Which would only prove the system

works.

BITSEY

Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count.

What's one murder to stop thousands?

ZACK

So he'll wait, release the whole

tape after the execution.

BITSEY

Right. Somewhere he must have the

original. What time is it?

DUSTY

Hello?

ZACK

Let's talk about your tape... No,

meet me at the station down the hill,

in fifteen minutes.

BITSEY

Don't move from the booth. Call the

second you see the truck. Remember,

let it ring just once. Then get into

the woods --

ZACK

I know. Go.

BITSEY

(pulling away)

Into the woods, Zack.

ZACK

Go!

BITSEY

(hitting eject)

Shit!

BITSEY

Shit!

BITSEY

Shit!

ZACK

Come on. Fucking come on.

CONSTANCE (V.O.)

(her voice weak)

Ready?

ZACK

He didn't show! Fuckin' move!

BITSEY

Everyone! Wake up New York, the

warden, the Governor, the goddamn

Supreme Court death clerk! How far

is it?

ZACK

Took me 30 this afternoon. You've

got 26, maybe more.

BITSEY

I'll make it.

BITSEY

(to the radio)

Give me the time. Give me the goddamn

time.

FADE TO:

ROBERTS (V.O.)

(to camera)

Here's what we know so far. Last

night, News Magazine posted on their

web site a video obtained by reporter

Bitsey Bloom...

ROBERTS (V.O.)

The footage appears to show Constance

Harraway commit suicide.

ROBERTS (V.O.)

Bloom reports she received the tape

Friday morning at a motel in

Huntsville, where she was staying

while conducting Gale's last

interview.

ROBERTS (V.O.)

The tape apparently had been in the

possession of a former DeathWatch

Director...

ROBERTS (V.O.)

(reading the name off

a card)

...Dustin Emil Wright. As you can

see, police and officials from the

State Attorney's office have been in

and out of his cabin all morning,

looking for clues to his whereabouts.

ROBERTS (V.O.)

...a fanatic in the movement to stop

the death penalty.

ROBERTS (V.O.)

It appears Wright withheld the tape

to make an obscure political point

about the potential for error in

capital cases.

DUSTY

All there?

BELYEU

Passport and ticket as well.

GOVERNOR HARDIN (V.O.)

Well, it's a tragedy for all of us.

As to whether this will change policy,

the people of Texas will have to

decide. Right now, the prudent course

is to put things on hold pendin' a

procedural review, allow ourselves

time to mourn.

KRUGER

You bet she'll review. Capital

punishment approval rates dropped 17

points.

BELYEU

What are you going to do?

DUSTY

(walking past him)

Go to the opera.

ROBERTS (V.O.)

Of course, the ultimate irony is

that David Gale, a man who became an

unwitting martyr, may achieve in

death what he worked for in life.

FADE TO:

DUSTY

Senorita Gale esta viviendo aqui?

OLD WOMAN

Si. Si.

DUSTY

Gracias.

MAIL GUY

This just came.

BITSEY

Key to your freedom? Key to your...

DUSTY (V.O.)

(calling)

It's over.

DUSTY (V.O.)

Want me to turn this off?

VOICE (V.O.)

No.

DAVID (V.O.)

I couldn't watch.

DUSTY (V.O.)

She preferred it that way. You were

right about not tellin' her the whole

plan.

DAVID

It helped her to think her death

would save me.

DUSTY (V.O.)

You sure you want to do this?

DAVID (V.O.)

Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count.

DUSTY (V.O.)

Better go ahead then.

FADE OUT:

THE END
