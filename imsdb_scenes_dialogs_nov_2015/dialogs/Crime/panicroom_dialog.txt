Panic Room - by David Koepp

PANIC ROOM

by

David Koepp

February 23, 2000

This film is short.

This film is fast.

LYDIA

-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five

feet deep, forty-two hundred square

feet, four floors with a rentable

basement apartment, so five

altogether, courtyard in back --

MEG

Could you slow down a little?

(looking back over her

shoulder)

Or we could wait for the car...

LYDIA

No cars.  Feet are faster.

MEG

How many more do we have after this?

LYDIA

None, there's nothing else, you know

how tight the market is.

MEG

This is it?  I told you on the

phone, I have to be moved in in two

weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce

that here.

SARAH

Mom, it's the sidewalk.

LYDIA

Oh, that miserable little prick is

already leaving.

EVAN

One day you will learn to respect

other people's time, Lydia, one day

you --

LYDIA

Evan, I am so sorry, you were a

saint to wait for us!

CUT TO:

EVAN

This is the middle of the house, the

entry floor, living room's over

there.  The kitchen floor's below us

and there's two bedroom floors

above.

EVAN

It's an enormous amount of space for

the money and I'll be perfectly

honest, the family is in no hurry

whatsoever.

EVAN

I don't have to tell you there is an

acute shortage of living space in

Manhattan right now and this is a

highly unique property.

LYDIA

No ball, kid.

EVAN

Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine,

the previous owner, was disabled the

last ten years of his life.  Highly

unusual, the elevator, you will not

find this in ninety percent of

brownstones.

MEG

Will they take asking price?  I need

a two week escrow and I'm already

approved for the loan.

EVAN

What say we see the house before we

dicker, hmm?

(starting up the stairs)

I have to warn you, this is exactly

the response we expected to get.

It's a very emotional property.

LYDIA

Who taught you to negotiate?

SARAH

It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't

have to pay the price on the tag.

MEG

I'm sorry.  Apartments, and...

money, and... this is more my

husband's area.

MEG

Was.  His area.  I'm not very good

at...

MEG

Things, and if I can't prove to my

soon to-be ex-husband that I can

provide a suitable place for our

daughter to live in the next

fourteen days, it's going to get

ugly between us.  Uglier.

EVAN (O.S.)

(from upstairs)

It would be so lovely if I could

shot the property before I leave!

CUT TO:

EVAN

Top floor.  Two bedrooms, one

bathroom.

EVAN

Third floor, spare bedroom, den,

what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used

it as an office.

LYDIA

(low voice, to Meg)

He's talking about Bernard

Pearlstine.

EVAN

(moving, through a

bathroom)

Master bath.

LYDIA

The hotel guy?  It's been in the

papers lately.  His kids are all

suing each other over his estate.

He was a total recluse, paranoid,

rich as hell, he was worth thirty

million or something, now it turns

out they can't find half of it.

(singsong)

Somebody took something didn't

belong to them!

EVAN

I hardly see how family gossip is

germane to showing the property.

LYDIA

(low, to Meg)

Stop calling it the property, you

sound ridiculous.

EVAN

(through a closet)

Master closet.

EVAN

Could the child please stop that?

LYDIA

KID!  NO ELEVATOR!

EVAN

And we emerge in the master bedroom.

MEG

Something's weird.

LYDIA

What?

MEG

I don't know, doesn't that corner

seem funny to you?

EVAN

I was waiting to see if you'd

notice!  On caravan, no one from our

office had the slightest idea.

EVAN

It's called a panic room.

MEG

A what?

EVAN

A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A

castle keep, in medieval times.

LYDIA

Oh, I've seen these...

EVAN

It's quite in vogue in high end

construction right now.  One really

can't be too careful about home

invasion.

LYDIA

Hey, this is perfect for you...

(Meg scoffs)

Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're

living alone now.  Your alarm goes

off, or you head glass break, or for

whatever reason you think someone's

broken into your home in the middle

of the night.  What are you going to

do?  Call the police and wait until

they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse

downstairs in your sexy little

underthings and check it out?  I

think not!

EVAN

Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried

phone line, completely separate, not

connected to the house's main line

and never exposed throughout the

house's infrastructure or outside

the house -- you can call the

police; nobody can cut you off.

Your own ventilation system,

complete with oxygen scrubber, so

you've got plenty of fresh air for

as long as you like.  And a bank of

video monitors --

EVAN

-- covering almost every corner of

the house.

MEG

Makes me nervous.

LYDIA

Why?

MEG

Ever read any Poe?

LYDIA

I don't think so, but I love her

album.

MEG

No, Edgar Allen.

LYDIA

(thinks)

The furniture guy?

MEG

(giving up)

What's to keep them from prying open

the door?

EVAN

Steel, four inches thick.

EVAN

Everything's spring-loaded, even if

the power's out it's fully

functional.

MEG

Open it.

LYDIA

Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with

this room, did he?

MEG

Open the door.

LYDIA

And with kids like he's got, no

wonder he wanted a place to hide.

EVAN

That's highly inappropriate.

MEG

I said open the door.

SARAH

My room.  Definitely my room.

LYDIA

That door is a safely hazard.

EVAN

Not at all.

EVAN

Infrared.  Like the beam in an

elevator doorway.  Won't let the

door close if something's blocking

it.

EVAN

Watch.

EVAN

(to Lydia)

Push that button for me, will you?

MEG

Don't!

CUT TO:

SARAH

Too many stairs.

MEG

Got us in here, didn't I?

SARAH

Shoulda got an apartment.

MEG

Well, I know that now.

SARAH

478-0150.

MEG

Battery's dead.

CUT TO:

MEG

The phone works.

(to Sarah)

Hey, I hooked up the phone.

SARAH

(sarcastic)

The crowd goes wild.

MEG

(ignoring the slight)

478...

SARAH

0150.

VOICE

Perry's Pizza, please hold.

CUT TO:

SARAH

Fuck him.

MEG

Don't.

SARAH

Fuck her too.

MEG

I agree.  But don't.

CUT TO:

SARAH

"Tom's throat felt so dry and tight

that it was a moment before he could

make any sound come out.  "Dad!" He

croaked.  "I'm - inside - the -

machine!" "Great Scott!"  The elder

scientist gasped.  He dashed across

the laboratory and switched off the

repelatron's motor.  "What happened,

son?" "The Durafoam hardened, Dad.

Get a solvent, quick -- you know the

formula!"

MEG

Bypass non-ready zones... shunt,

enter, zone number...

MEG

Bypass non-ready zones... ah, shunt,

enter, shunt again, zone number...

wait...

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

JUNIOR

Fuck.

BURNHAM

I know.

RAOUL

What?

BURNHAM

A woman and a little girl, both

asleep upstairs.

JUNIOR

Fuck!

BURNHAM

Keep your voice down.

JUNIOR

They're not supposed to be here!

BURNHAM

This was your department, Junior.

JUNIOR

They're not supposed to be here!

BURNHAM

That's why the key didn't work, they

changed the locks.

JUNIOR

Fourteen day escrow, man, that's

almost three weeks!  They shouldn't

be here for another week!  They

don't own this house yet!

BURNHAM

(pause)

Exactly how is fourteen days almost

three weeks?

JUNIOR

Fourteen business days.  Escrow is

always business days.

JUNIOR

I mean, right?  Isn't it?

BURNHAM

You're an idiot.

RAOUL

Watch your mouth.

JUNIOR

It's okay, Raoul.

BURNHAM

(to Junior)

Who is this guy?

JUNIOR

Raoul is cool.  That's all you need

to know.

BURNHAM

This is insane.  I'm outta here.

JUNIOR

Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We

can still handle this.

(to Raoul)

Can we still handle this?

RAOUL

It's just the woman and the kid?

BURNHAM

Unless Daddy comes back later.

JUNIOR

Daddy's not coming back, she's in

the middle of a divorce, it's just

the two of them.  We're okay, here.

(to Raoul)

We can do this, right?

RAOUL

You're fuckin' A we can do this.

BURNHAM

Not with me.  Not with people.

JUNIOR

Forty-five minutes.  That's all you

said you need.  That's like nothing.

BURNHAM

She'll call the cops, they'll be

here before I get unpacked.

JUNIOR

So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can

totally administrate that part.

RAOUL

No problem.

BURNHAM

I don't want Raoul to administrate

that part.

JUNIOR

They won't get hurt.

BURNHAM

What about us?  What if she has a

gun?

JUNIOR

Raoul, what in God's name do we do

if she has a gun?

BURNHAM

Asshole.

JUNIOR

A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and

you insult him?  Hey, who's the

idiot?  Huh?

BURNHAM

Where did you get this clown?

JUNIOR

I met him at the tables, same as

you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we

have a little muscle right about

now.

BURNHAM

What tables?  I've never seen him

before.

JUNIOR

Different tables.

BURNHAM

(to Raoul)

The fuck did you bring a gun for?

RAOUL

You're welcome.

BURNHAM

Peace out.

JUNIOR

We can't do it without you, Burnham.

JUNIOR

It's still a good plan.  It's

just... got a twist.

BURNHAM

Yeah.  Kidnapping.

JUNIOR

Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't

kidnap somebody in their own house.

It's just breaking and entering,

unless we take 'em someplace.  Or

something like that, I'm pretty

sure.

BURNHAM

Pure idiot.

JUNIOR

I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An

idiot's grandson.  I'm third-

generation idiot.  But for once in

my life I had a good idea, and I'm

not giving up so easy.  You are?

Are you actually telling me that for

the first time in your life you're

gonna throw your cards on the table

and go home early?  I can't believe

my eyes.

(Burnham hesitates)

Fourteen million dollars upstairs,

Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole.

Baby, you'll be so far out of the

hole you could draw bricks every

night for the next twenty years and

still shit green.

(Burnham sways)

Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.

CUT TO:

RAOUL

(whispers)

No face.

JUNIOR

Top floor, get the little girl and

keep her there.  I'll bring the

woman up.  Gimme.

JUNIOR

(points to Burnham)

Stay here.  Nobody gets past you.

MEG

Wake up... wake up...

MEG

Wake up...come on, come on...

SARAH

WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!

SARAH

What's going on?!

MEG

People.  In the house.

RAOUL

IN THE ELEVATOR!  BOTH OF 'EM HEADED

TOWARD YOU!

MEG

He's going down.

SARAH

That room!

MEG

What?!

SARAH

PANIC ROOM!

SARAH

No.  you gotta...

JUNIOR

SHE'S COMING BACK UP TOWARD YOU!!

MEG

Damn it!

SARAH

It doesn't work?!

MEG

Different phone line, I never hooked

it up!

BURNHAM

Tell me... tell me they're not in

there...

CUT TO:

MEG

Can't hear a thing.

SARAH

What do they want?

MEG

I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't

know.

SARAH

What do we do?

MEG

Wait.

SARAH

What if they get in here?

MEG

They can't.  They can't get in here.

No.  They can't.

SARAH

I heard you.

MEG

Feel okay?

SARAH

Yeah.

MEG

Shaky?

SARAH

Nope.

MEG

Chills?

SARAH

Huh uh.

SARAH

Don't worry about me.

MEG

Hey...

SARAH

Go ahead.

SARAH

You can do it.

MEG (O.S.)

Excuse me.

MEG (O.S.)

The police are on their way.

MEG

I suggest you leave.

MEG

How'd he know that?

MEG

(into speaker)

Take what you want and get out.

MEG

"What we want is in that room."

SARAH

They're coming in here, aren't they?

MEG

No, I told you, they can't.  It's

not a possibility.

MEG

(into speaker)

What do you know about this room?

MEG

(into speaker)

We're not coming out.  We're not

letting you in.  Get out of my

house.

(clicks off)

SARAH

Say fuck.

MEG

(into speaker)

Fuck.

SARAH

"Get the fuck out of my house."

MEG

(into speaker)

Get the fuck out of my house!

SARAH

Answer.

MEG

Oh, please.

SARAH

Give me a break.

MEG (O.S.)

Conversation's over.

BURNHAM

Got her right where you want her,

Junior.

JUNIOR

Shut up.

BURNHAM

When you said you'd let 'em go I

thought she'd come running right out

for sure.

JUNIOR

Shut up and let me think.

BURNHAM

I'm afraid to let you think, Junior.

Things get worse when you think.

(sniffs)

Oh, that's gonna help.

JUNIOR

(holding in a hit)

Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are

we gonna do?

RAOUL

What if she called the cops?

BURNHAM

She didn't.

JUNIOR

She said she did.

BURNHAM

She lied.  Cops woulda been here by

now if she called 'em.  Besides,

Junior cut the phones.

RAOUL

What the fuck is funny about this?

BURNHAM

God.

RAOUL

There is not one thing funny here.

BURNHAM

Who else but God could think this

shit up?  I spend ten years building

those fucking rooms to keep people

out, now I gotta figure out how to

get in.  God, man, He just loves the

irony.

JUNIOR

Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic

and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are

you gonna get us into that room?

BURNHAM

Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in

the room.

RAOUL

So what the fuck are we supposed to

do?!

BURNHAM

Make her come out.  And when she

does, that's when we gotta be

careful.  She can't get out of this

house.  She can't even think she can

get out of this house.  We just keep

them here and keep them quiet for

forty-five minutes.  And I don't

want

(Raoul)

Joe Pesci here standing over them

with his fat sweaty finger on the

trigger.  That's a sure way for us

to end up with two dead bodies and

little puffs of smoke burning out of

our heads up in Greenhaven.  So

we're gonna seal the place up.  They

wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll

help 'em.  Make it impossible for

them to leave.  Once they come out

of that room.

JUNIOR

And why exactly would they want to

come out?

BURNHAM

Workin' on it.

CUT TO:

MEG

Hey.  Relax, okay?

MEG

I mean it, lie down.  You get your

adrenaline up and you know what's

gonna happen.

SARAH

Are you freaking out?

MEG

Little bit.  Yeah.

SARAH

Small space?

MEG

(nods, fast)

Don't though.

(talk about it, that is)

SARAH

Why did the chicken cross the road?

MEG

What am I, a five year old?

SARAH

Why did the chicken cross the road?

MEG

I don't know, why?

SARAH

To prove he wasn't chicken.

MEG

What the hell are they doing?

CUT TO:

MEG

(barely audible)

... locking us in...

CUT TO:

SARAH

Mom?

SARAH

Are you okay?

SARAH

(barely heard)

MOM?!  MOM!!

MEG

Not here... not here... someplace

else... someplace else...

SARAH (O.S.)

Mom?!  Mom!!

SARAH (O.S.)

Mom, please!!

SARAH

THEY'RE COMING IN!  THEY'RE COMING

IN!

SARAH

YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK

OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY

HERE WITH ME!

MEG

I am.  I'm here.

SARAH

YOU HAVE TO!

MEG

I'm here.  I'm here.

MEG

We're fine.  We're okay.

JUNIOR

Open it.

BURNHAM

I did.

RAOUL

He said open it.

BURNHAM

Just sending a message.  She'll get

the point.

RAOUL

We ain't playin', here.

SARAH

What, what, what is it?!

MEG

On the floor!  Get on the floor!

BURNHAM

Look, don't be stupid...

JUNIOR

Be quiet.

BURNHAM

We're trying to scare them, not kill

them!

JUNIOR

They're coughing.

BURNHAM

They're gonna die in there!

JUNIOR

Nobody is gonna die, man, will you

please have the balls to follow

through with a good idea?  Think

about it, what would you do if you

were them, stay in there and choke

to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're

just getting them to come out for

forty-five minutes, forty-five

fucking minutes!  The worst that's

gonna happen is they pass out, we

drag 'em out here into the fresh

air, and they'll be fine.

BURNHAM

Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are

we supposed to get into the room if

they pass out?

JUNIOR

Cut it back a little bit.

RAOUL

No fucking way.

JUNIOR

He's right, we can't get into the

room if they're dead!

BURNHAM

Oh.

BURNHAM

I'M COMING IN THERE, BITCH, I AM

COMING IN THERE!  I AM COMING IN

THERE!

SARAH

Neighbor!

RAOUL

(to Junior)

We're gonna talk.  Downstairs.

RAOUL

You stay.  Make sure she don't come

out.

CUT TO:

MEG

Morse code?

SARAH

(nods)

Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot

dot.

MEG

Where'd you learn S.O.S.?

SARAH

"Titanic."

MEG

Got him!

SARAH

Come on, come on...

MEG

Yes, yes, yes, yes...

SARAH

We're never getting out of here.

MEG

Shhh...

CUT TO:

JUNIOR

We're not gonna do anything about

him, he's fine.

RAOUL

If you think I'm gonna let my half

of the fourteen million bucks slip

away because of --

JUNIOR

"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in

math class?  Three people, three

shares, one third.  Four point six

six six repeating.

RAOUL

I'm just saying, the man is a

problem.  And he's your problem.

Wasn't me idea to bring him along.

JUNIOR

That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your

idea, none of this was your idea, it

was mine, it's my family we're

ripping off, it's my prick

grandfather who built that fucking

room, it was my idea to get the

plans, I found the floor safe, and

it was my idea to ask a guy who

builds these rooms to help break

into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at

no point did I say "you" or Raoul,"

got it?

RAOUL

He puts his hands on me again I'll

bury a slug in his ear.

JUNIOR

No, you will not, because without

Burnham there's no way in hell we're

gonna get into that safe, so as far

as I'm concerned he can paint your

ass blue and run it up a flagpole

and you won't lay a finger on him,

you understand me?

RAOUL

Don't take no tone of voice with me,

Homes.

JUNIOR

What is this shit you're talking all

of a sudden?  You're a bus driver,

"Homes," you live in Flatbush, so

please don't start spouting some

Elmore Leonard shit you just heard

because I saw that movie too,

MEG

Damn.

MEG

Oh yes, yes...

MEG

... the hell is he?

SARAH

Do it.

MEG

Yeah, but where's the third guy?

SARAH

Not in the bedroom.  Do it!

MEG

If it looks like I can't get back,

just close the door.

SARAH

No.

MEG

Close it!

SARAH

WAIT!

BURNHAM

Oh, hell...

SARAH

GO GO GO!

BURNHAM

What'd she get, what'd she get,

what'd she get...

BURNHAM

Cell phone.

JUNIOR

Shit!

MEG

Oh, no.  No, no, no no no no no...

MEG

Oh come on, come on, come on...

BURNHAM

(softly)

I don't think we'll be talking on

our cell phone from in there...

MEG

Wires...

BURNHAM

Phone...

MEG

... wires.

SARAH

What are you doing?

MEG

I saw something, I saw...

MEG

... phone wires!

MEG

I may not have hooked up the phone

in here, but I hooked up the main

line, and there's a jack at the base

of this wall outside, I saw it!

BURNHAM

Say, while we're on the subject of

phones...

BURNHAM

When I said cut the line, did you

cut the main line at the junction

box in the basement like I said, and

which I repeated, or did you just

cut the cord on the phone in the

kitchen?

JUNIOR

I, uh, I...

JUNIOR

... hit a little snag finding the

one in the basement.

MEG

Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue

first, blue is phones!

SARAH

Blue is phones?

MEG

Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!

BURNHAM

God damn it!

OPERATOR

911 emergency --

MEG

I'm at 26 West --

OPERATOR

-- please hold.

MEG

NO!

MEG

Damn it!

SARAH

Call Dad!

MEG

On it!

VOICE

Hello?

MEG

Listen to me!  There are three --

MEG

Hello?  Don't... are...

MEG

He'll do something.

SARAH

Uh uh.

MEG

He'll know we're in trouble.  He

heard me, I said "There are

three..."

SARAH

He won't even know who it was.

MEG

What would you think, in the middle

of the night?  I mean, three what,

three bears?  He'll call the police.

SARAH

Stop it.

MEG

He's just across the park, this is

why we got places so close to each

other, in case we needed each other,

we're still a family, he'll help

us...

SARAH

He --

MEG

He WILL.

MEG

I'm sorry.

SARAH

I'm sorry.

MEG

Why?

SARAH

I was trying not to tell you...

MEG

What?

SARAH

I'm dizzy and thirsty.

JUNIOR

She's never coming out.

BURNHAM

Hey.

JUNIOR

And we're never getting in.

BURNHAM

Do me a favor and don't talk.

JUNIOR

Jesus, what was I thinking?

MEG

Come on, come on... stay with me...

you gotta drink...

MEG

Okay, listen, honey, you went double

digit here, you must have been

shooting out adrenaline like crazy,

we gotta bring your blood sugar back

up, okay?  Can you hear me?

SARAH

I'm dizzy, not deaf.

MEG

Hey, she's still a smart ass,

excellent sign.  Did you see any

sugar in here?  Any candy bars,

anything sweet?

SARAH

Huh uh.

MEG

Okay, you just gotta calm yourself

down, that's all, just stay calm and

your adrenaline will go back to

normal and you'll be fine.

SARAH

What if I keep dropping?

MEG

Not an option.

SARAH

What if I do?

JUNIOR

We're leaving.

RAOUL

The hell we are.

BURNHAM

Hey man, after all we went through I

am not walking out when we're this

close.

JUNIOR

Close?  Are you insane?  We're

nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll

make an anonymous phone call on

Monday, they'll find the floor safe,

and I'll inherit the shit.  Little

piece of it, anyway, it's better

than nothing.

BURNHAM

What about us?

JUNIOR

Here.  For your time.

JUNIOR

Five hundred bucks here.

JUNIOR

Suit yourself.

RAOUL

Nobody leaves.

JUNIOR

Observe.

BURNHAM

We're not leaving.  I'm getting in

that room, and I'm opening that

safe.

JUNIOR

Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but

ten out of ten for attitude.

SARAH

What if I spazz out?

MEG

(forced calm)

No biggie, we've been through it a

dozen times, I just jab you with the

Glucogen.

SARAH

Where is the Glucogen?

MEG

Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the

little fridge in your room.

SARAH

(pause)

I'm sorry, Mom.

MEG

Hey, quit apologizing, you're

starting to sound like Grandma.

You're not gonna have an attack.

Okay?

SARAH

Okay.

BURNHAM

Would you wait?  Would you please

just wait a minute?

BURNHAM

You walk out that door and you lose

your share of the money.

JUNIOR

Yeah, whatever.

BURNHAM

I mean it!

JUNIOR

Adios.

RAOUL

Nobody leaves.

BURNHAM

Oh God... oh, my God...

RAOUL

You should see the look on your

face.

BURNHAM

The fuck did you do that for?!

RAOUL

Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me.

Drives his German car up to 125th

Street a couple of times, buys a few

rounds, thinks he's a tough guy,

thinks he knows me.

(to the corpse)

You don't know one thing about me!

VOICE

What the h --

BURNHAM

Stop it!  Stop it!

RAOUL

(turning on him)

Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's

the fucking clown now?!

BURNHAM

Me.  I am.

RAOUL

That's right.

BURNHAM

Burning me.  It's burning my eye.

RAOUL

I have the gun.

BURNHAM

Yes.

RAOUL

Remember that.

BURNHAM

Please...

BURNHAM

What?  What do you want me to do?

RAOUL

What do you think?  Get us into that

room.

BURNHAM

I can't.

RAOUL

You can.  You're full of ideas.  You

just need to squeeze one out.

BURNHAM

I can't...

RAOUL

You got till the count of three.

Then you end up like him.

RAOUL

One.  Squeeze.

BURNHAM

This is ridiculous...

RAOUL

Two.  Squeeze harder.

BURNHAM

I can't just...

RAOUL

Th --

BURNHAM

Okay, okay!  Okay.

RAOUL

You got an idea?

BURNHAM

Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta

check something.

CUT TO:

BURNHAM

Okay, look.  I know you can hear me.

Your wife and kid are in there.

You're gonna get 'em to come out.

Or --

BURNHAM

Or I can't stop what he's gonna do.

Do you understand?

BURNHAM

Good.

BURNHAM

OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR!

BURNHAM

OPEN UP!

SARAH (O.S.)

DADDY!

HARRIS

DON'T DO IT!  NO MATTER WHAT

HAPPENS, DON'T OPEN THE DOOR!

DON'T O --

BURNHAM

STOP IT, MAN, STOP IT, THAT'S HIS

KID IN THERE, HIS KID IS WATCHING

THIS!!

MEG

Oh God, oh my God...

SARAH

You gotta jab me, Mommy...

RAOUL (O.S.)

(calmly)

If you leave the house, we'll kill

her.

RAOUL (O.S.)

If I see a uniform in the house,

we'll kill her.

MEG

Oh... oh...

RAOUL (O.S.)

You understand?

BURNHAM

(into speaker)

I just... I just need forty-five

minutes.

RAOUL

Saw my face, man.  Saw my face.

RAOUL

Shut up.

MEG

(shouting into the camera)

-- cine, she needs the MEDICINE!

GIVE HER THE --

BURNHAM

It's gonna be cool, kid.  Be outta

here before you know it.

BURNHAM

Are you okay?

RAOUL

Hurry up, for Christ's sake!

BURNHAM

The hell does she want?

RAOUL

I don't know, she keeps screamin'

the same thing over and over.

RAOUL

Drugs.  She wants drugs.  What the

fuck?

BURNHAM

Oh, man...

BURNHAM

What is it?

SARAH

I need...

BURNHAM

Yeah?

SARAH

... 'jection...

BURNHAM

An injection?

BURNHAM

That stuff?

BURNHAM

Can you do it yourself?

BURNHAM

Well, I don't know how.

RAOUL

I don't fucking believe this.

(to Sarah)

You gotta wait.

BURNHAM

Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a

little more, and your mom'll give it

to you.  You can wait a half hour,

can't you?

RAOUL

Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's

just like, tired, she's gotta rest.

You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.

RAOUL

Come on.

BURNHAM

Tell me the truth, okay?  What's

gonna happen if you don't get this?

SARAH

Coma.  Die.

BURNHAM (O.S.)

I understand.  I'll give her the

shot.

RAOUL

You're wasting your fucking time,

man, you're wasting my time.  You

don't know how to do this, and the

longer we stay in here, the more

likely she's gonna lose it and call

the cops!

BURNHAM

Are you gonna open the safe?

BURNHAM

Then shut up and get out of my way.

RAOUL

Don't look at me.

BURNHAM

Okay, kid, all I know about this is

what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk

me through it.

BURNHAM

Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV

don't lie, right?

BURNHAM

You seem like a good kid.  Your

mom... only saw her for a second,

but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?

BURNHAM

Hey, nod or something, show me

you're still alive, will ya?

BURNHAM

Attagirl.  That too tight?

BURNHAM

You guys are pretty rich, huh?

BURNHAM

Yeah, you don't think about that

stuff.  Good for you.

BURNHAM

I know, I know.  I really screwed

the pooch this time.  I never did

anything like this before.  Break

into somebody's house?  Not even

close.  Bad cards, Kid.  I swear to

God, I been on the wrong end of

maybe six straight years of bad

cards.  House.  Car.  Wife.

(snaps his fingers --

gone)

Those are some seriously bad cards.

And still, every time I pick up a

fresh hand I swear to God, the rush

comes so hot and prickly I feel it

right down to my toes because this

time, this one time, it might be

there, this time it might be that

hand, that perfect hand, that

monster hand.

(shakes his head)

And you thought you were sick.

BURNHAM

Feel better?

BURNHAM

Woulda been a hell of a dad.

CUT TO:

RAOUL (O.S.)

She's okay.  Now sit down and wait.

RAOUL

Congratulations.  You saved her life

for ten minutes.

HARRIS

Police.

MEG

(gasps)

You called the police?

HARRIS

You... scared...

MEG

Don't.  Say.  A word.

RAOUL

Holy shit... holy shit...

RAOUL

She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the

kid!  She just killed her own kid!

BURNHAM

It's not her fault, it's not her

fault, the guy must have called

them.  Look, look, look, she's

telling us.

BURNHAM

She's gonna handle it.

RAOUL

She better.

MEG

Yeah?

COP 1

Everything okay?

MEG

Huh?

COP 2

Are you all right?

MEG

What are you guys -- what time is

it?

COP 1

'Bout four o'clock.

MEG

I don't get it.

COP 2

We got a call...

MEG

Somebody called you?

COP 1

Can we come in?

MEG

What do you want?

COP 1

We'd like to come in.

MEG

No, you can't come in.

COP 2

Are you okay?

MEG

I'm fine.

COP 1

Can we come in?

MEG

Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who

called you?

COP 1

You don't look so good.

MEG

You wake me out of a sound sleep at

four in the morning and then tell me

I look like hell?  Of course I look

like hell, you don't look so hot

yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here,

thank you for checking, can I go?

COP 1

Your husband says you said "There

are three..." right before you got

cut off.

MEG

Oh, that phone call...

COP 1

Ma'am, if there's something you want

to say to us right now that maybe

you can't say to us right now, maybe

you just want to make a signal, by

blinking a few times, something like

that.

COP 1

That's something you could do.

Safely.

MEG

Man, you are good!  You mean, like,

if somebody was in the house or

something?  That's great, they

really train you guys these days,

don't they?

MEG

No.  I'm fine.  Cross my heart.

COP 1

May I ask what the rest of that

sentence was going to be?

MEG

(stalling)

Huh?

COP 1

The sentence that started "There are

three."  What was the rest?

MEG

Okay, look.  My husband and I just

broke up.  It's my first night in

the new house, and I was feeling a

little lonely and a little drunk.

The sentence, if you insist on

knowing, was going to be "There are

three things I'll do for you if you

come over right now and get in bed

with me."

MEG

But thank God I came to my senses

before I said all that and hung up

instead, so nobody would ever know

what I was thinking, unless, of

course, two policemen showed up in

the middle of the night to

interrogate me about it.

COP 2

You want her to show you which three

things, Rick, or should we just go?

RAOUL

She saw my face.  The kid too.

BURNHAM

That's your problem.

RAOUL

That's their problem.

BURNHAM

Let me fucking finish this so we can

get out of here.

RAOUL

You finish.  Then we finish.

BURNHAM (O.S.)

-- posed to mean?

RAOUL (O.S.)

You're here with me, you're already

on the hook for one.  Buy one, you

get the rest for the same price.

You know that.

BURNHAM (O.S.)

Get the fuck away from me.

RAOUL (O.S.)

The kid in here.  The other two when

we come out.

BURNHAM

Bullshit.

RAOUL

You know how this gotta end.

RAOUL (O.S.)

They stay in the house.

CUT TO:

MEG

Fourteen.

MEG

No camera, no camera, no camera...

RAOUL

Hey!

SARAH

Sorry.  Can't control it sometimes.

SARAH

(to Raoul)

Won't happen again.

NEIGHBOR

What the hell do you think you're

doing, young lady?!

RAOUL

The walls are steel, right?

BURNHAM

Not that one.

RAOUL

NOT THAT ONE?!

BURNHAM

Hey man, it's the neighbor's house,

who breaks in through the neighbor's

house?!

BURNHAM

WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE

NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!

RAOUL

We've got the Kid!

(shouting at the wall)

WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck

is she thinking?!

BURNHAM

She's got your gun, that's what

she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to

bring a gun for?!

BURNHAM

Almost there...

BURNHAM

ALMOST THERE...

BURNHAM

JESUS!

BURNHAM

I GOT THE MONEY, LET'S GO!!!

BURNHAM

GO, LET'S GO, OUTTA HERE!!

RAOUL

YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!

BURNHAM

FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!

COP 1

Put your hands up.

BURNHAM

Monster hand.

DISSOLVE TO:

SARAH

I mean, uptown is close to Dad's

place, but somebody at school said

the Village is really cool, so... I

don't know, it's so great to be

close to the park and everything...

What do you think, I mean, give me a

clue, here, where are we gonna live?

FADE OUT.
