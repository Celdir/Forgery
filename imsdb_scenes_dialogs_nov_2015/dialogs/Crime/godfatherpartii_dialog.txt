Mario Puzo's THE GODFATHER

DISSOLVE TO:

WOMAN

(Sicilian)

They've killed young Paolo!  They've

killed the boy Paolo!

WIDOW

(Sicilian)

Don Francesco.  You murdered my

husband, because he would not bend.

And his oldest son Paolo, because

he swore revenge.  But Vitone is

only nine, and dumb-witted.  He

never speaks.

DON FRANCESCO

(Sicilian)

I'm not afraid of his words.

WIDOW

(Sicilian)

He is weak.

DON FRANCESCO

(Sicilian)

He will grow strong.

WIDOW

(Sicilian)

The child cannot harm you.

DON FRANCESCO

(Sicilian)

He will be a man, and then he will

come for revenge.

WIDOW

(Sicilian)

I beg you, Don Francesco, spare my

only son.  He is all I have.  In

the name of the Holy Spirit, I

swear he will never be a danger to

you...

WIDOW

(continuing)

But I will kill you myself!

(she lunges at the

Mafia chieftain)

Vitone, go!

MOSCA

(Sicilian)

Our Friend promises misery to

anyone who harbors the boy Vito

Andolini.

(he turns and shouts

in the other direction)

Our Friend promises misery to

anyone who harbors the boy Vito

Andolini.

STROLLO

(Sicilian, O.S.)

Our Friend will be hard with any

family who gives help to Vito

Andolini.

MOSCA

(Sicilian O.S.)

...misery to any family who harbors

the boy, Vito...

FATHER

(Sicilian)

Vito...We pray for you.

MOSCA

(Sicilian O.S.)

...Andolini...

STROLLO

(Sicilian O.S.)

Our Friend promises misery to any

family...

STROLLO

(Sicilian)

...who harbors the boy Vitone

Andolini.

MOSCA

(Sicilian)

Let no one give help to the boy

Vito Andolini...

DOCTOR

You understand?  Smallpox.  Smallpox.

DISSOLVE TO:

PRIEST

Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit

peccata mundi.

PRIEST

Corpus Christi.

ANTHONY

Amen.

KAY (O.S.)

Smile, Anthony.  Smile.

PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)

Now, one with the whole family.

KAY (O.S.)

Mr. Corleone can't right now...

KAY (O.S.)

...but we'll get one with the ladies.

PHOTOGRAPHER

All together now, c'mon, Anthony...

CHEESE and

(flash)

KAY

Thank you.

KAY

Do you think it'll show in the

picture?

MAMA

Two months never shows.  Two months

look like you had a big lunch.

VOICE (O.S.)

Oh, Mrs. Corleone.

MRS. BARRETT

Hello, Mrs. Corleone.  I'm Fran

Barrett, our place is just down the

lake.  This is my husband, Marshall.

KAY

I'm so happy you could come.

MR. BARRETT

The place is transformed.  We've

been watching workmen come and go

all summer.

MRS. BARRETT

Where is Mr. Corleone?

KAY

A business meeting ran late...but

he promised he wouldn't be long.

KAY

This is our son Anthony Vito

Corleone.  Today he made his First

Holy Communion.

DEANNA

I will not shut my mouth, and keep

your Goddamn hands off of me!

FREDO

Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for

a drive.

DEANNA

I just had a drive; besides, I want

to see my brother-in-law Michael.

FREDO

(trying to get her to

put her shoes on)

Yeah, but I don't want him to see

you.

DEANNA

What beats me, is how you guys

could be brothers.  You musta been

your Mother's rotten egg.

DEANNA

(lifting a glass of champagne)

Young man, young man...thank you,

young man.

WAITER

(impressed)

Excuse me, but aren't you...

DEANNA

Yes, you saw me in the movies, Good

Humor man, and yes, I had more off

than my shoes!

FREDO

Goddamn bitch.

DEANNA

Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance

with me.

FREDO

Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice

people here.  Friends of Kay's.

He'll never forgive me if you ruin

his party.

DEANNA

I hate to see you cringe in front

of him.  How come you're so scared

of your own kid brother?

FREDO

He's the head of the family.

DEANNA

Don't follow me!

CONNIE

Mama...Mama!  Here I am!

MAMA

Constanzia.  We expected you last

week; we sent the car to pick you

up at the airport last week.

CONNIE

I know, it was chaos; but anyway,

here I am one week late.

(lifting a shiny

green package out of

Merle's arms)

This is for my Mama.  You remember

Merle?

MAMA

(not giving him a

chance to greet her)

Yes, thank you.

CONNIE

How are the kids?

MAMA

Well, thank you, they asked for you

all week.

CONNIE

I got surprises for everybody!

MAMA

(glancing at the wrapping)

Bought at the airport.

CONNIE

(gazing about)

This is swell.  Where's Michael?

I've got things to get straight

with him and I can't wait on line.

MAMA

You go see your children first, and

then you wait to see your brother

like everybody else.

PENTANGELI

Hey, kid!  You got any red wine?

WAITER

(offering the tray)

Only champagne and cocktails.

PENTANGELI

Forget it...

PENTANGELI

Fredo!  Sonuvabitch.  You look great.

FREDO

Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie

"Five-Angels"...thought you were

never coming West.

PENTANGELI

(affectionately)

Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey,

what's with the food?  Some kid in

a white jacket brings me a ritz

cracker with some chopped liver.

'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a

peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker

with chopped liver.' Go get me a

salami sandwich and a glass of wine

or I'll send you and your white

jacket to the dry cleaners!

FREDO

Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you.

Reminds me of old times.

PENTANGELI

You remember Willy Cicci, don't

you, Freddie?  We was all together

with the old man Clemenza in

Brooklyn... before...uh...

FREDO

We were all upset about that.

PENTANGELI

That's what I'm here to talk to

your brother about.  What's with

him, I got to get a letter of

introduction to have a 'sitdown'?

FREDO

(throwing his arm

around him)

C'mon, I see what I can do.

SANDRA

Michael, this is Gardner Shaw.

Francesca and he have been seeing

each other for six months now.

Gardner, this is Francie's Uncle

Michael.

GARDNER

(a little nervous)

I've heard a lot about you, Mr.

Corleone.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Sit down.  Francie.

SANDRA

They would like to set an engagement

date, and...

MICHAEL

Let them speak for themselves.

FRANCESCA

We love each other, Uncle Michael.

And, we want to be married.  I came

to ask for your blessing.

FREDO (O.S.)

Hey, Mike...guess who's here?

NERI

Not now, Freddie...

FREDO

Tell Mike Frankie 'Five-Angels' is

here.

NERI

Not now...

MICHAEL

Francesca is my oldest brother's

daughter.  He died many years ago,

and ever since I've felt much more

of a father than an uncle.  I love

her very much.  I'm pleased and

impressed that you had the thought

to come to me before going on with

your plans.  It shows me that

you're a considerate man, and will

be good to her.  What are you

studying in college?

GARDNER

My major is Fine Arts, sir.

MICHAEL

How will Fine Arts support your new

wife?

GARDNER

It's embarrassing to say, sir, but

I'm a major stockholder in the

family corporation.

MICHAEL

(smiling)

Never be embarrassed by your wealth.

This recent contempt for money is

still another trick of the rich to

keep the poor without it.

(warmly)

Of course I give you my blessing.

Let's set the wedding soon...it

will be my pleasure to give the

bride away.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

...and take a few courses in

Business Administration just to be

on the safe side!

FRANCESCA

Thank you, Uncle Michael.

MICHAEL

Make her dowry impressive.  He

comes from a family who still

thinks an Italian bride goes

barefoot.

FRANCESCA

Uncle Michael is the greatest man

ever!

NERI (O.S.)

His name is Fred Vincent.  He owns

a small pizza parlor in Buffalo...

NERI (O.S.)

(continuing)

...American wife and two small kids.

We traced him and found that he's

in the country illegally, from

Sicily...

NERI (O.S.)

...came over around 1956.  Sponsored

by the Barzini Family.

MICHAEL

It's him.  Fabrizzio.

(almost to himself)

Revenge is a dish that tastes best

when it's cold.

NERI

How do you want me to handle it?

MICHAEL

Later.  Tom?

HAGEN

I've cleared it through the

Senator's chief aide, a man named

Turnbull.  Turnbull's a heavy

gambler, and into us for over a

hundred grand, so I figure his

information is reliable.

HAGEN

The Senator can be set up; but he

thinks of himself as a clean

politician.  So it's got to be on

terms he can live with: campaign

contribution, donation to a

charitable cause that he controls,

things like that.  If he gets even

the inkling that you think you're

buying him, he'll freeze up.

Nevada's a funny state, they like

things both ways here... All right.

Turnbull says the Senator will be

here at two-thirty, and he's been

primed.  He knows you'll want to

meet with him alone, and he knows

it's about the Tropicana's license.

At any rate, he expects to be

introduced around to some of the

influential people here today, and

generally treated as an ordinary

guest.  Just go light on him,

Mikey, sometimes the biggest crooks

don't like to think of themselves

as crooks...

HAGEN

I'm sorry; of course, you know that.

MICHAEL

Two-thirty.  That gives me time to

see my boy.

HAGEN

Connie's outside.

HAGEN

I promised; she said it was urgent.

MICHAEL

All right.  Apologize to Pentangeli.

MICHAEL

I said I would see my sister, alone.

MERLE

I think this concerns me too.

(taking a cigarette

from the dispenser)

You don't, do you?

CONNIE

How are you, honey?  You've met

Merle, haven't you.  He was with me

in Vegas.

MICHAEL

I saw him with you.

CONNIE

We're going to Europe next week.  I

want to get passage booked on the

Queen.

MICHAEL

Why do you come to me?  Why don't

you go to a travel agent?

MERLE

We're going to get married first.

MICHAEL

The ink on your divorce isn't dry.

Your children see you on weekends;

your oldest boy, Michael Francis...

was in some trouble with the Reno

police over some petty theft that

you don't even know about.

CONNIE

Michael...

MICHAEL

You fly around the world with lazy

young men who don't have any love

for you, and use you like a whore.

CONNIE

You're not my father!

MICHAEL

Then why do you come to me?

CONNIE

Because I need MONEY!

MICHAEL

(softly)

Connie, I want to be reasonable

with you.  You have a house here,

with us.  You can live here with

your kids...and you won't be

deprived of anything.  I don't know

much about Merle; I don't know what

he does for a living; what he lives

on.  Why don't you tell him marriage

is really out of the question; and

that you can't see him any more.

He'll understand.  But if you

disobey me, and marry this pimp...it

would disappoint me.

CONNIE

It was my father's money; and I'm

entitled to what I need.  Where is

Tom Hagen?

MICHAEL

Are you finished?

MERLE

I think so.

MICHAEL

Then out.

PENTANGELI

I can't believe that out of thirty

professional musicians, not one of

you is Italian!

(as the musicians laugh)

C'mon, give us a tarantella.

MICHAEL

Rocco, his friends must be hungry.

See what you can do, but I'd like

to keep them away from the guests.

MICHAEL

You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.

Johnny Ola.

OLA

Sure, I remember Tom from the old

days.

MICHAEL

Tom isn't going to sit in with us,

Johnny.  He only handles specific

areas of the family business.  Tom?

HAGEN

Sure, Mikey.

HAGEN

If you need anything, just...

MICHAEL

Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.

OLA

I just left our friend in Miami.

MICHAEL

How is his health?

OLA

Not good.

MICHAEL

Is there anything I can do; anything

I can send?

OLA

He appreciates your concern,

Michael, and your respect.

OLA

The hotel's registered owners are

one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney

Barclay, both Beverly Hills

attorneys.  In reality it's split

between the Old Lakeville Road

Group from Cleveland, and our

friend in Miami.  He takes care of

others outside the country, you

know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman

runs the store, and does all right,

but I've been instructed to tell

you, that if you move him out, our

friend in Miami will go along with

you.

MICHAEL

He's very kind, tell him it's

appreciated.  I'm sure it will be

profitable all the way around.

OLA

He always makes money for his

partners.  One by one, our old

friends are gone.  Death, natural

or not, prison, deported.  Our

friend in Miami is the only one

left, because he always made money

for his partners.

KAY

Anthony, Daddy's busy.

MICHAEL

(rising)

This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr.

John Ola of Miami.

KAY

I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator

Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs.

Barrett wanted to thank you before

they left.  Won't you join us, Mr.

Ola?

MICHAEL

Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay.

Please tell the Senator I won't be

a minute.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Kay.

KAY

Yes, Michael.

KAY

Anthony!

(she runs after him)

Anthony, where are you going?

HAGEN

Where's my wife?

SANDRA

With Mama, putting the baby to

sleep.  Francesca's very happy.

Michael was kind to her.  She

idolizes him.

(pause; she looks at

a despondent Hagen)

The children are all out in the

speedboat.  I'm going to my house.

MAESTRO

Ladies and gentlemen, a most

distinguished guest would like to

say a few words: Senator and Mrs.

Pat Geary of the state of Nevada!

HAGEN

(quietly)

He doesn't want my help any more.

He doesn't need it.

SANDRA

We don't know that's true, he never

said that.

HAGEN

I can feel it in the way he talks

to me.

HAGEN

Just now when Johnny Ola showed up,

he asked me to leave them alone.

Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian

contact.  I was on the inside of

ten, twenty meetings with him.  But

today Mike asked me to leave, like

an outsider.

SANDRA

Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.

HAGEN

It's as though he blames me for the

ground the family lost when I was

Consigliere to Sonny.

HAGEN

I love Michael, I want to help him,

be close to him.  I don't want to

end up a third string lawyer making

property settlements for the hotels.

SANDRA

We have a little time now.

SENATOR GEARY

...my thanks, and the thanks of the

young people of the State of

Nevada, for this most impressive

endowment...

(he holds a check in

his hand)

...made to the University in the

name of Anthony Vito Corleone.

Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Michael

Corleone.

MAESTRO

And now, the Nevada Boys' Choir

have prepared a special thank you

for Mr. Michael Corleone.

SENATOR GEARY

Where can we meet alone?

MICHAEL

Find Hagen.

MICHAEL

It was very kind of you to come to

my home on this occasion, Senator.

My wife has been very concerned

with making a good impression on

the people who are our neighbors,

and your appearance here has made

her very happy.  If I can ever

perform a service for you, you only

have to ask.

MICHAEL

My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged

this all through your man Turnbull.

SENATOR GEARY

I thought we would meet alone.

MICHAEL

I trust these men with my life.

They are my right arms; I cannot

insult them by sending them away.

SENATOR GEARY

(taking out some medication)

Some water.

SENATOR GEARY

Alright, Corleone.  I'm going to be

very frank with you.  Maybe more

frank than any man in my position

has ever spoken to you before.

SENATOR GEARY

The Corleone family controls two

major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno.

The licenses were grandfathered in,

so you had no difficulties with the

Gaming Commission.  But I have the

idea from sources...

(takes the water from

Neri and swallows his pills)

...that you're planning to move in

on the Tropicana.  In another week

or so you'll move Klingman out,

which leaves you with only one

technicality.  The license, which

is now in Klingman's name.

MICHAEL

Turnbull is a good man.

SENATOR GEARY

Let's forget the bullshit, I don't

want to stay here any longer than I

have to.  You can have the license

for two hundred and fifty thousand

in cash, plus a monthly fee equal

to five percent of the gross...

SENATOR GEARY

...of all three Corleone hotels.

MICHAEL

Senator Geary, I speak to you as a

businessman who has made a large

investment in your state.  I have

made that state my home; plan to

raise my children here.  The

license fee from the Gambling

Commission costs one thousand

dollars; why would I ever consider

paying more?

SENATOR GEARY

I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone,

because I don't like you; I don't

like the kind of man you are.  I

despise your masquerade, and the

dishonest way you pose yourself and

your fucking family.

MICHAEL

(quietly)

We're all part of the same

hypocrisy, Senator.  But never

think it applies to my family.

SENATOR GEARY

All right, then let me say you'll

pay me because it's in your

interests to pay me.

SENATOR GEARY

I'll expect your answer, with

payment, by tomorrow morning.  Only

don't contact me...from now on,

deal only through Turnbull.

MICHAEL

Senator...

(cold and calm)

...you can have my answer now if

you'd like.

MICHAEL

My offer is this.  Nothing...not

even the thousand dollars for the

Gaming Commission, which I'd

appreciate if you would put up

personally.

MICHAEL

It's all right, Tom, we'll talk

later.  Tell Frankie Pentangeli I'd

like him to have dinner at my

family table before we do business.

MAMA

Cent' Anne.

DEANNA

What's 'cent' Anne?'

FREDO

A hundred years...it's a toast.

CONNIE

It means we should all live happily

for one hundred years.  The family.

If my Father were alive, it'd be

true.

MAMA

Connie.

CONNIE

Merle, have you met my sister-in-

law Deanna?

DEANNA

What a pleasure, Merle.

(shaking hands)

MAMA

(Sicilian)

Those two are perfect for each other.

MERLE

What's that mean?

CONNIE

Mama!

PENTANGELI

(Sicilian)

Michael, in all respect, I didn't

come three thousand miles for dinner.

MICHAEL

(Sicilian)

I know.

PENTANGELI

(Sicilian)

When do we talk?

MICHAEL

(Sicilian)

After dinner.

KAY

Anthony, you were talking to Mr.

Pentangeli?

ANTHONY

His name is "Five-Angels."

PENTANGELI

Yeah, the kid and me talked Sicilian.

A one-way conversation!

PENTANGELI

Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart

attack, but the Rosato Brothers

gave it to him.

MICHAEL

We were all heartbroken at the

news; but that wasn't cause to

start a war.

PENTANGELI

Okay, now it's my family in

Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up

Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how

can I run my family with you

challenging my every move?  You're

too far from the street, Mike, the

only way to reason with the Rosato

Brothers is to whack 'em and whack

'em fast.

MICHAEL

You were unfair with them.

PENTANGELI

Says who?

MICHAEL

Clemenza promised Rosato three

territories in the Bronx after he

died, and then you took over and

welched.

PENTANGELI

Clemenza promised them nothing, he

hated the sonsuvbitches.

MICHAEL

They feel cheated.

PENTANGELI

Michael, you're sitting up here in

the Sierra Mountains with champagne

cocktails making judgment on the

way I run my family.

MICHAEL

(suddenly in Sicilian)

Your family still carries the name

Corleone, and you will run it like

a Corleone!

PENTANGELI

(Sicilian)

And while I feed my family in New

York, you put the knife in my back

in Miami.

MICHAEL

(firm)

Frankie, you're a good old man, and

you've been loyal to my Father for

years...so I hope you can explain

what you mean.

PENTANGELI

The Rosatos are running crazy;

taking hostages, spitting in my

face, because they're backed by the

Jew in Miami.

MICHAEL

I know.  That's why I want you to

be fair with them.

PENTANGELI

How can you be fair with animals?

They recruit niggers and spicks;

they do violence in their own

Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And

everything is dope and whores; the

gambling is left to last.  Let me

run my family without you on my

back.  I want them taken care of.

MICHAEL

No.  There are things that I have

planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't

want them disturbed.

PENTANGELI

You give your loyalty to a Jew over

your own blood.

MICHAEL

Frankie, you know my father

respected Roth, did business with

him.

PENTANGELI

He did business...but he never

trusted him.

NERI

Should he go?

MICHAEL

The old man had too much vino

rosso, or he'd never talk openly

that way.  Let him go back to New

York; I've already made my plans.

(he checks his watch)

It's late; I've spent so little

time at the party.

DEANNA

I wanta dance...whatsa matter with

that?

FREDO

Dancing is alright; you're falling

on the floor.

DEANNA

Whatsamatter, you don't want me to

dance with him 'cause he's a man!

FREDO

Deanna, I'm going to belt you right

in the mouth!

DEANNA

These Eye-ties are really crazy

when it comes to their wives.

DEANNA (O.S.)

Jesus, never marry a WOP, they

treat their wives like shit.

ROCCO

Freddie, Mike says take care of it,

or I have to.

DEANNA

He's a friend of your brother!

DEANNA

"Shuffle off to Buffa...

Shuffle off to Buffa...

Shuffle off to Buffalooooo..."

FREDO

Hey Mike, what can I say?

MICHAEL

Forget it, just go take care of her.

MICHAEL

How's the baby?

KAY

Sleeping inside me.

MICHAEL

Does it feel like a boy?

KAY

Yes, Michael, it does.

MICHAEL

I'm sorry about some of the people

I had to see today.  It was bad

timing... but it couldn't be helped.

KAY

It made me think of what you told

me once.  In five years, the

Corleone family will be completely

legitimate.  That was seven years

ago.

DISSOLVE TO:

NERI

Are you Klingman?

KLINGMAN

Who's asking?

NERI

Where can we talk?

KLINGMAN

Right here.

NERI

I represent the interests of the

Corleone family.  We make the

invitation to you to tie up your

affairs and be out of the hotel by

Monday morning.

KLINGMAN

Who do you think you're talking to?

NERI

You said you were Klingman.

KLINGMAN

You don't come in here, talk to an

owner in Las Vegas like that.

NERI

You missed my point; you are no

longer an owner.

KLINGMAN

Get out of my hotel.

KLINGMAN

Boys, get him out of here.

KLINGMAN

All right!  All right, I'll be out.

NERI

(to the staring performers)

Keep it going.

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

GENCO

Come on, you've got to see her!

IMPRESARIO

Carla!

IMPRESARIO

(Sicilian)

No...please, not my daughter.

GENCO

(Sicilian)

The Black Hand.

GENCO

(Sicilian)

(whispered)

Let's get out of here.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

Because you protested, it will cost

a hundred more.

GENCO

(Sicilian)

I know what you are thinking,

Vitone, but you don't understand

yet how things are.  Fanucci is of

the Black Hand.  Everyone in the

neighborhood pays him, even my

father.

VITO

(Sicilian)

He's an Italian?

GENCO

(Sicilian)

A pig of a Neaponitan.

(spits)

VITO

(Sicilian)

Why?  Why does he bother other

Italians?

GENCO

(Sicilian)

Because he knows them; he knows

they have no one to protect them.

Vitone?  What do you think of my

angel?

VITO

(Sicilian)

Beautiful.

GENCO

(Sicilian)

Beautiful.

VITO

For you, she is beautiful.  For me,

there is only my wife!

GENCO

I know.  That's why I brought you

with me!

GENCO

(Sicilian)

I bet you can't guess what happened?

VITO

(Sicilian)

What?

GENCO

(Sicilian)

Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped

Fanucci today; slit his throat from

ear to ear.

VITO

(Sicilian)

No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?

GENCO

(Sicilian)

Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers.

They wanted to scare him, that's

all.  Make him look bad.

VITO

(Sicilian)

In Sicily, when you attack a man,

you had better finish him.

GENCO

(Sicilian)

I wish they had.  He takes fifty

dollars a week from my father's

cash drawer.  But you can't kill a

man like Fanucci.

VITO

(Sicilian)

Why?

GENCO

(Sicilian)

Because he's what we say...

"connected"... You wait, see what

happens to those guys from Ninth

Avenue.

FANUCCI

Buon giorno.

GENCO

(Sicilian)

What did I tell you.  The one who

cut him was found in an alley.  And

the family of the others paid

Fanucci all their savings to make

him forswear his vengeance.

VITO

(Sicilian)

(surprised)

And he agreed?

GENCO

(Sicilian)

He took the money.  Now he wants

double from everybody in the

neighborhood, including Papa.

VITO

(Sicilian)

(almost to himself)

A real mafioso doesn't sell his

vengeance.

SIG. ABBANDANDO

(Sicilian)

Vitone.  How is your son?

VITO

(Sicilian)

We are all well.

SIG. ABBANDANDO

Vitone...I...Fanucci has a nephew.

VITO

(Sicilian)

And you must give him my job.

VITO

(Sicilian)

You have been kind to me since I

was a boy; taken care of me, and

been as a father.  I will always be

grateful to you.  Thank you.

SIG. ABBANDANDO

(Sicilian o.s.)

Vitone!

SIG. ABBANDANDO

Here...for your family.

VITO

No...please understand...I cannot

accept.

CLEMENZA

Hey Paisan!  Hold this for me until

I ask for it.  Hurry up!

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

(casually)

Do you have my goods still?

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

Did you look inside?

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

I'm not interested in things that

don't concern me.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

I have a friend who has a fine rug.

Maybe your wife would like it.

VITO

(Sicilian)

We have no money for a rug.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

No.  He would give it away.  I know

how to repay a consideration.

VITO

(Sicilian)

She would like it.

VITO

(Sicilian)

Your friend lives in a fine building.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

Oh yes, the very best.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

Ah, he's not at home.  Oh, well, he

wouldn't mind.

CLEMENZA

A little help.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

Good, you waited for us.

TESSIO

(Sicilian)

Who is he?

AUGUSTINO

(Sicilian)

My son, Carmine...it's all right.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

(to Vito)

Paisan Augustino was a gunsmith in

the Italian army.  We do each other

favors.

AUGUSTINO

(Sicilian)

(while he works)

My boy is studying the flute.  He

plays very well.  He helps me at

night so we can buy him a silver

flute someday.  Now he has one made

of wood.  Carmine...play...play for

my friends.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

Lady, I got a bargain on these

dresses.  Five dollars each.  You

gotta pay at least fifteen, maybe

twenty in a store.  Look at them,

first class.

WOMAN

(Sicilian)

I don't know which one I like best.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

You'd look beautiful in all of

these.  You should buy at least two.

WOMAN

(Sicilian)

Are you kidding?  My husband will

kill me if he knows I paid five

dollars for one dress.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

You can have two for five.

TESSIO

(Sicilian)

What took so long?

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

She couldn't decide.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

Vito, take the rest of the stock

over to Dandine's warehouse; he'll

move it to a wholesaler.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

Ahhh, young fellow.  People tell me

you're rich, you and your two

friends.  Yet, you don't show

enough respect to send a few

dresses to my home.  You know I

have three daughters.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

This is my neighborhood.  You and

your friends have to show me a

little respect, ah?  This truck you

hijacked was in my neighborhood.

You should let me wet my beak a

little.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

I understand each of you cleared

around six hundred dollars.  I

expect two hundred dollars for my

protection and I'll forget the

insult.  After all, young people

don't know the courtesies due a man

like myself.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

Otherwise the police will come to

see you and your wife and children

will be dishonored and destitute.

Of course, if my information as to

your gains is incorrect, I'll dip

my beak just a little.  Just a

little, but no less than one

hundred dollars, and don't try to

deceive me, eh paisan?

VITO

(Sicilian)

(quietly)

My two friends have my share of the

money.  I'll have to speak to them

after we deliver these to the

wholesaler.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

You tell your friends I expect them

to let me wet my beak in the same

manner.  Don't be afraid to tell

them.  Clemenza and I know each

other well, he understands these

things.  Let yourself be guided by

him.  He has more experience in

these matters.

VITO

(Sicilian)

(shrugging innocently)

You must understand, this is all

new to me...

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

I understand...

VITO

(Sicilian)

But thank you for speaking to me as

a Godfather.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

(impressed)

You're a good fellow.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

You have respect.  A fine thing in

the young.  Next time, speak to me

first, eh?  Perhaps I can help you

make your plans.

TESSIO

(Sicilian)

Do you think he'd be satisfied with

the two hundred dollars?  I think

he would.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

That scar-faced bastard will find

out what we got from the wholesaler.

He won't take a dime less than

three hundred dollars.

TESSIO

(Sicilian)

What if we don't pay?

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

(gestures, it's hopeless)

You know his friends...real animals.

And his connections with the police.

Sure he'd like us to tell him our

plans so he can set us up for the

cops and earn their gratitude.

Then they would owe him a favor;

that's how he operates.  We'll have

to pay.  Three hundred, are we

agreed?

TESSIO

(Sicilian)

What can we do?

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

They say Fanucci has a license from

Maranzalla himself to work this

neighborhood.

VITO

(Sicilian)

If you like, why not give me fifty

dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I

guarantee he will accept that

amount from me.

TESSIO

(Sicilian)

When Fanucci says two hundred he

means two hundred.  You can't talk

with him.

VITO

(Sicilian)

I'll reason with him.  Leave

everything in my hands.  I'll

settle this problem to your

satisfaction.

VITO

(Sicilian)

I never lie to people I've accepted

as my friends.  Speak to Fanucci

yourself tomorrow.  Let him ask you

for the money, but don't pay it,

and don't in any way quarrel with

him.  Tell him you have to get the

money and will send me as your

messenger.  Let him understand that

you're willing to pay what he asks,

don't bargain.  I'll go to his

house, and quarrel with him.  He

likes me; enjoys explaining how

things are here.  He uses ten

sentences when he only needs one,

so while he talks, I'll kill him.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

Vitone!

(to Tessio)

Our driver has drunk too much wine.

TESSIO

(Sicilian)

(laughs at himself)

He's going to kill Fanucci.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

(stern)

Then, after that, what?  Joe

'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie

Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla

himself, c'mon!

VITO

(Sicilian)

Fanucci is not connected; he is

alone.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

(sarcastically)

What?  You read it in the papers?

VITO

(Sicilian)

This man informs to the police;

this man allows his vengeance to be

bought off... No, he is alone.

TESSIO

(Sicilian)

If you're wrong...

VITO

(Sicilian)

If I'm wrong, they will kill me.

CLEMENZA

(Sicilian)

(quietly)

All three daughters are at church;

he is alone.  It's important that

you let his neighbors see you leave.

Tessio has broken the latch on the

skylight of his building.

CLEMENZA

(English)

See, Brother Carmello, even the

church makes numbers.

PRIEST

(English)

It's only the way we collect that's

different.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

I think there's only two hundred

dollars under my hat.

(he peeks)

I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.

VITO

(Sicilian)

I'm a little short.  I've been out

of work.  Let me owe you the money

for a few weeks.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

Ah, you're a sharp young fellow.

How is it I've never noticed you

before

(he takes the two

hundred and pours

some wine for Vito)

You're too quiet for your own

interest.  I could find some work

for you to do that would be very

profitable.

(he rises)

No hard feelings, eh?  If I can

ever do you a service let me know.

You've done a good job for yourself

tonight.

FANUCCI

(Sicilian)

What's the matter, Signora?  You

don't say 'good evening'?

WOMAN

(Sicilian)

'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci.

VITO

(Sicilian)

Santino, your papa loves you.

DISSOLVE TO:

MICHAEL

Can't you sleep?

MICHAEL

Are you alright?

ANTHONY

Yes.

MICHAEL

Did you like your party?

ANTHONY

I got lots of presents.

MICHAEL

Do you like them?

ANTHONY

I didn't know the people who gave

them to me.

MICHAEL

They were friends.

ANTHONY

Did you see my present for you?

MICHAEL

No, where is it?

ANTHONY

On your pillow.

MICHAEL

I'm leaving very early tomorrow,

before you wake up.

ANTHONY

I know.  How long will you be gone?

MICHAEL

Just a few days.

ANTHONY

Will you take me?

MICHAEL

I can't.

ANTHONY

Why do you have to go?

MICHAEL

To do business.

ANTHONY

I can help you.

MICHAEL

Some day you will.

KAY

Michael?  Why are the drapes open?

MICHAEL

Go with the kids.

ROCCO

They're still on the property.

Maybe you better stay inside.

MICHAEL

Keep them alive.

ROCCO

We'll try.

MICHAEL

It's important.

MICHAEL

It will be all right.  We were lucky.

ROCCO

Your family all seem to be okay in

the other houses; your Mother's

still sleeping.

MICHAEL

And?

ROCCO

No sign of them yet; but they're

still on the Estate.

DEANNA (O.S.)

Goddamn you!  You're all nuts here,

I'm not goin' to calm down...

FREDO

Deanna, will you get back into the

house!

DEANNA

I'm getting out of here I said;

these guys all have guns!

MICHAEL

Fredo, can't you shut that woman up!

(to Rocco's men)

Get her in here!

DEANNA

(whimpering)

I don't want to stay here...

FREDO

Mike, what can I do, she's a

hysterical woman...

KAY

Leave her alone!  You're talking as

though she has no right to be

frightened when there are machine

guns going off in her backyard.

MICHAEL

(to Rocco)

Have Tom Hagen meet me in the

Harbor House.

MICHAEL

Sit down, Tom.

MICHAEL

There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

I know that's upset you in the

past; and you've felt that it was

because of some lack of trust or

confidence.  But it is because I do

trust you that I've kept so much

secret from you.  It's precisely

that at this moment, you are the

only one that I can completely

trust.  In time, you'll understand

everything.

HAGEN

(nods with this statement)

But your people... Neri... Rocco;

you don't think...

MICHAEL

No, I have confidence in their

loyalty... but this is life and

death, and Tom, you are my brother.

HAGEN

Mikey, I hoped...

MICHAEL

No Tom, just listen.  All my people

are businessmen; their loyalty is

based on that.  One thing I learned

from my father is to try to think

as the people around you think...and

on that basis, anything is possible.

Fredo has a good heart, but he is

weak...and stupid, and stupid

people are the most dangerous of

all.  I've kept you out of things,

Tom, because I've always known that

your instincts were legitimate, and

I wanted you to know very little of

things that would make you an

accomplice, for your own protection.

I never blamed you for the setbacks

the family took under Sonny; I know

you were in a position of limited

power, and you did your best to

advise and caution him.  What I am

saying is that now, for how long I

do not know, you will be the Don.

If what I think has happened is

true; I will leave tonight, and

absolutely no one will know how to

contact me.  And even you are not

to try to reach me unless it is

absolutely necessary.  I give you

complete power: over Neri... Fredo,

everyone.  I am trusting you with

the lives of my wife and children,

and the future of this family,

solely resting on your judgment and

talent.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

...But Tom, you must know that I do

this only because I believe you are

the only one who is capable of

taking over for me.

MICHAEL

I've prepared this; have had it for

over a month.  It won't explain

everything; but indicates where I

will be, so in a sense, it is my

life.

(he hands the envelope

to Hagen)

Also, there are three tasks that

must be executed immediately.  Pop

would have given those to Luca --

You knew Pop as well as anyone, act

as though you were him.  It

discusses Kay as well; that will be

the most difficult.  The men who

tried to kill me tonight, will

never leave the estate.

HAGEN

Will we...be able to get who

ordered it out of them?

MICHAEL

I don't think so.  Unless I'm very

wrong...they're already dead.

Killed by someone inside...very

frightened that they botched it.

That's why I am going to disappear

in a few minutes, and leave

everything to you.

HAGEN

But if you're wrong...

MICHAEL

If I'm wrong...

MICHAEL

...I don't think I'm wrong.

(he indicates the knock)

Yes.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Fish them out.

HAGEN

Get rid of the bodies.  Tomorrow

morning I want a report made to the

local police, and paper, that some

explosives we keep on the property

were accidentally ignited.

FADE OUT.

SENATOR GEARY

All right, Mr. Hagen, you've got

ten minutes.

SENATOR GEARY

...and the tape will be running.

HAGEN

Actually, I've come with good news;

the Corleone family has done you a

favor.

SENATOR GEARY

What the hell are you talking about?

HAGEN

We know you're a busy man, with

plenty of enemies -- we saw the

opportunity to do you a favor, and

we did.  No strings.

SENATOR GEARY

No strings.

HAGEN

You know there's a Senate

Investigating Committee recently

set up; we thought it would be

unfortunate if they were to trace

anything though-provoking to your

name.

SENATOR GEARY

No one can trace anything to me; I

pride myself on that.

HAGEN

Do you gamble?

SENATOR GEARY

A little; what's so thought-

provoking about that?

HAGEN

Do you owe markers?

SENATOR GEARY

Maybe two, three thousand dollars.

HAGEN

The Corleone family has paid them

off for you...as an expression of

our esteem.

SENATOR GEARY

There's thirty grand worth of paid

off markers -- I never owed that

much.

HAGEN

Our mistake.  But what does it

matter; it was our money.

(rising)

We don't even expect thanks.

SENATOR GEARY

You paid off thirty grand I never

owed.

HAGEN

We'll keep it quiet; the people who

know are trustworthy...the Committee

needn't find out.

SENATOR GEARY

And what's the price of their not

finding out.

HAGEN

Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not

hostile.

SENATOR GEARY

(he despises Hagen)

Thanks...friend.

KAY

(graciously)

Yes.

MAN

I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're

not to let you through.

KAY

(disbelieving)

I'm going to the market.

MAN

If you could just give us a list,

we'll pick up anything you want.

KAY

Whose orders are these?

MAN

Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

HAGEN

Kay.

HAGEN

I wanted to explain this myself...

I had business in Carson City.

HAGEN

It's Michael's request...for your

safety.  We can send out for

anything you need.

KAY

I'm supposed to stay in my house.

HAGEN

Within the compound will be fine.

KAY

I was supposed to take the children

to New England next week.

HAGEN

That's off now.

KAY

I'm going to see my parents.

HAGEN

Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot;

and what he did tell me, I can't

repeat.  But the responsibility for

you and the kids was the most

important thing he left me with.

KAY

How long does this go on?

HAGEN

I don't know.

(pause)

I'm sorry, Kay...

KAY

Am I a prisoner?

HAGEN

That's not the way we look at it.

PURSER

(holding up the telegram)

I'm terribly sorry to disturb you

but we have received two telegrams.

MERLE

(reluctantly)

Well...come in.

CONNIE

What is it?

PURSER

Yes.  One is from our office in New

York.  The check that you wrote for

your passage has been returned.

CONNIE

Can't be...

MERLE

Why don't you wire your bank?

PURSER

The other telegram is from your

bank.  Your account has been closed

and the company is warned not to

extend any credit.

CONNIE

I'll take care of it in Naples.

PURSER

The company hopes so.  But for now,

we have orders to change your

accommodations.

CONNIE

That son of a bitch!

PORTER

Mr. Paul?

MICHAEL

Yes.

PORTER

You ordered lunch?

MICHAEL

Put it right there.

MICHAEL

Thank you.

MICHAEL

(Sicilian)

(to Bussetta)

You'll wait in the car.

TERRI

I'm just going to make lunch.  How

about a tuna fish sandwich?

MICHAEL

Thank you, Mrs. Roth.

TERRI

Hyman...HYMAN, your friend is here.

(turning to Michael)

Why don't you go right upstairs, Mr.

Paul?

MICHAEL

Fine.

TERRI

I'll give a yell when lunch is ready.

ROTH

Sit down, this is almost over.  You

follow the baseball games?

MICHAEL

Not for a few years.

ROTH

I like sporting events -- I really

enjoy watching them in the afternoon.

One of the things I love about this

country.  I loved baseball ever

since Arnold Rothstein fixed the

World Series of 1919...I heard you

had some trouble.

MICHAEL

Yes.

ROTH

What a mistake; people behaving

like that, with guns.

(he shakes his head)

It was my understanding we left all

that behind.  But, let me tell you,

the important thing is that you're

all right.  Good health is the most

important thing; more than success;

more than power; more than money.

MICHAEL

The incident of the other night is

a nuisance that I can take care of.

I came to you because I want

nothing to affect our agreement; I

wanted to clear everything I'm

going to do with you, just in case.

ROTH

You're a considerate young man.

MICHAEL

You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I

have much to learn from you.

ROTH

(warmly)

However I can help you...

MICHAEL

The Rosato Brothers have performed

services for you in the past; I

understand that they are under your

protection.

ROTH

(simply)

We do favors for each other...

MICHAEL

Technically, they are still under

the Clemenza wing of the Corleone

Family, now run by Frankie

Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died,

the Rosatos wanted territory of

their own.  Pentangeli refused, and

came to me, asking for permission

to eliminate them.  I, of course,

knew of their relationship with

you, and in gratitude for your help

with the Tropicana matter, turned

him down.  Pentangeli was furious,

and paid one hundred and fifty

thousand dollars to have me killed.

I was lucky and he was stupid.

I'll visit him soon.

(leaning toward the

old man, sincerely)

The important thing is that nothing

jeopardize our plans, yours and

mine.  This thing of ours, that we

will build.

ROTH

Nothing is more important.

MICHAEL

(quietly)

Pentangeli is a dead man; do you

object?

ROTH

It's always bad for business; but

you have no choice.

MICHAEL

Then it's done.  I must choose his

replacement: it cannot be Rosato.

ROTH

Of course you must keep control of

your family.

ROTH

Michael, these things are

unimportant.  Who should be the

manager of a dime store, Joe or

Jack?  Unimportant.  You do what

you think is right.  You're a young

man, and I'm old and sick.  What we

do together in the next few months

will be history, Michael; it has

never been done before.  We will do

this historical thing together, and

even your Father could never dream

it would be possible.  We are

bigger than U.S. Steel, you and

me... because in America, anything

is possible!

(pause)

But soon I will be dead, and it

will all belong to you.

TERRI

My goodness, you'll rupture your

eardrums, Hyman.

PENTANGELI

Rosato, where's your brother?

ROSATO

Sitting right behind you.

PENTANGELI

He don't want to talk?

ROSATO

We worked it all out beforehand.

PENTANGELI

Are we going to eat or what?

ROSATO

Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.

PENTANGELI

(sarcastically)

Forget it; I'm suddenly without an

appetite.  You're making big

trouble, Carmine.

ROSATO

You weren't straight with us,

Frankie, what else could we do?

PENTANGELI

We could have talked first, saved a

lot of running around.

ROSATO

You wasn't listening, you didn't

want to talk.

PENTANGELI

Don't I look like I'm listening?

ROSATO

We want Brooklyn one hundred

percent.  No more taxes to you.  We

want to be only loosely connected

with your family -- sort of a

under-family all of our own.  Then

we can act on all internal matters

without talking.  Also we want you

to inform Michael Corleone that we

can deal directly with him.

PENTANGELI

I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll

order something.  Joe.

(one of his men)

Get me some bracciole or something.

And pay cash.

(to Rosato)

And in return for these concessions,

what do you do for me?

ROSATO

We will release the hostages,

number one.  Number two, we're here

for you to count on when you need

us.  We're independent, but we're

here if you need us.  In general,

we'll cooperate with you and your

businesses, and you in turn will

cooperate with us.  Pari persu.

PENTANGELI

Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari

persu...?

ROSATO

My lawyer went over this beforehand.

PENTANGELI

What assurances do I have that

there will be no more kidnapping,

no more hits?

ROSATO

The same assurance we got from you.

PENTANGELI

What if I say shove it?

ROSATO

Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue

DeRosa will need to be fitted for

slabs.

PENTANGELI

You want a war?

ROSATO

We got no choice.

PENTANGELI

You know if there's a way I'll go

to the commission and the commission

will side with me.  That puts me

and the other New York families

against you.

ROSATO

We got friends in the commission.

PENTANGELI

(getting angry)

I'm talking about Italians!

ROSATO

What about Michael Corleone?

PENTANGELI

He supports me.

ROSATO

Maybe, yes... maybe no.

PENTANGELI

You drove old Pete Clemenza to his

grave, Carmine; you and your

brother.  Turning on him; trouble

in his territories -- you and your

demands.  I hold you responsible,

just as though you shot him in the

head.  And I ain't gonna let that

go for long!

ROSATO (O.S.)

Hey, Five-Angels...

PENTANGELI

Nobody I hate calls me Five-Angels

to my face!

PENTANGELI

What's up?

PENTANGELI

(Sicilian)

What's this?

WIFE

Michael Corleone.

PENTANGELI

One Michael Corleone...Dove?

WIFE

(Sicilian)

He's in your study.

PENTANGELI

Don Corleone, I wish you let me

know you was coming.  We could have

prepared something for you.

MICHAEL

I didn't want you to know I was

coming.  You heard what happened in

my home?

PENTANGELI

Michael, yes, we was all relieved...

MICHAEL

(furious)

In my home!  In the same room where

my wife was sleeping; where my

children come in their pajamas, and

play with their toys.

MICHAEL

I want you to help me take my

revenge.

PENTANGELI

Michael, anything.  What is it I

can do for you?

MICHAEL

I want you to settle these troubles

with the Rosato Brothers.

PENTANGELI

I was just going to contact you,

Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' -

in fact, I just come from there.

MICHAEL

I want you to settle on their terms.

PENTANGELI

Mike, I don't understand.  Don't

ask me to do that.

MICHAEL

Trust me; do as I ask.

PENTANGELI

It would be the beginning of the

end for my family.  How can I keep

all my other territories in like if

I let two wise-guys stand up and

demand this and that, and then give

it to them?

MICHAEL

Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I

have your loyalty?

PENTANGELI

Always... But sometimes I don't

understand.  I know I'll never have

your kind of brains, in big deals.

But Mike, this is a street thing.

And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind

the Rosato Brothers.

MICHAEL

I know.

PENTANGELI

Then why do you want me to lay down

to them?

MICHAEL

(coldly, but convincing)

Frankie, Roth tried to have me

killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I

don't know yet why.

PENTANGELI

Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's

hit 'em now, while we still got the

muscle.

MICHAEL

This was my father's old study.

When I was a kid, we had to be

quiet when we played near here.

When I was older, I learned many

things from him here.  I was happy

that this house never went to

strangers; first Clemenza took it

over, and then you.  My father

taught me, in this room, never to

act until you know everything

that's behind things.  Never.  If

Hyman Roth sees that I interceded

with you in the Rosato Brothers'

favor, he'll think his relationship

with me is still sound.  I'm going

somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We

have friends in some very important

business that we're making.  Do

this for me; you make the peace

with the Rosato Brothers on their

terms.  Let the word out that I

forced you; you're not happy wit

hit, but acquiesced, just because

of me.  It will get back to Hyman

Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can

trust me.

PENTANGELI

Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.

MICHAEL

Good.

NERI

Fifteen percent skim?

HAGEN

Twenty-five this time.

NERI

It might show.

HAGEN

Mike wants it.

NERI

We've never sent this much with one

courier.

HAGEN

(to the courier)

Your plans are a little different

this time.  You skip Miami, and go

straight to Geneva.  It's to be

deposited to this number.

(handing him a small envelope)

And it's got to be there by Monday

morning, no slip-up.

COURIER

I think I was 'picked-up' last trip.

That hour layover I had at Kennedy.

I went over and bought a paper...

NERI

Those were our people.

COURIER

Okay, just thought you should know.

HAGEN

Let them count.

NERI

What's up?

HAGEN

No questions.

NERI

I got to ask questions, Tom,

there's three million dollars cash

in that pouch; Mike is gone and I

have no word from him.

HAGEN

Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm

the Don.

NERI

How do I know you haven't gone into

business for yourself?

HAGEN

You've been through a lot with us

so I'm going to give you the truth.

Mike knows it was someone within

the compound that set him up for

that hit.  So nobody is to know

where he is, not you, not Rocco,

not even his brother Fredo.  Sorry,

Al, I know how you feel about

Mike...but he still remembers Tessio.

FADE OUT.

THERESA

Hungry?

HAGEN

Just a little.

THERESA

I've invited Mama, Sandra and the

kids for barbecue.

HAGEN

What about Kay?

THERESA

I couldn't find her.  She's been so

broody, sticks to herself.

HAGEN

Let me try Kay.

HAGEN'S SON

Hey, Pop, heads up!

HAGEN

Kay?

HAGEN

Anyone hungry?

HAGEN

Hello?

SANDRA (O.S.)

She's gone, Tom.

HAGEN

What do you mean gone?

SANDRA

The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came

by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried

to say she wasn't in, but Kay

spotted them and asked if they

would take her and the kids for a

ride.  That was three hours ago.

HAGEN

(furious)

Why didn't someone tell me!

SANDRA

I wanted to tell you alone; your

wife doesn't know what's going on.

HAGEN'S SON

Hey, Dad!

HAGEN

Rocco!

ROCCO

I know.  I went down to the Barrett

house.  But she's gone.  They drove

her and the kids to North Tahoe

airport.

HAGEN

Goddamn it, where were you?

ROCCO

I was in my house.  Willy tried,

but it would have taken some

strong-arm to stop her, and he

figured you wouldn't want that.

HAGEN

(to one of the men)

Get me a Scotch and water.

ROCCO

She took a flight to San Francisco.

We figure she's going to connect to

New Hampshire; her parents' place.

HAGEN

(almost to himself)

I can't let him down.

HAGEN

All right, let me think a minute.

ROCCO

Me too, Tom?

HAGEN

Yeah, give me a minute.

HAGEN

Oh Christ, Pop.  It was so good

when you were alive.  I felt I

could handle anything...

CAPTAIN

Habana, Habana.

SAM ROTH

Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth.

Welcome to the Capri; my brother's

upstairs.  You wanta take a rest

before you see him, or can I get

you something, anything at all?

MICHAEL

No, I'm fine.

SAM ROTH

This is it!  We think it makes

Vegas look like the corner crap game.

MICHAEL

Very impressive.

SAM ROTH

Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike,

I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he

manages the casino for us.

COHEN

(appreciating

Michael's status)

Mr. Corleone.

SAM ROTH

Pleasure to meet you, I'm sure...

LEON

(Spanish)

Most respected gentlemen, allow me

to welcome you to the City of

Havana, the Republic of Cuba on

behalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio

Batista.

LEON (O.S.)

I'd like to thank this distinguished

group of American Industrialists,

for continuing to work with Cuba,

for the greatest period of

prosperity in her entire history.

Mr. William Proxmiro, representing

the General Fruit Company... Messrs.

Corngold and Dant, of the United

Telephone and Telegraph Company; Mr.

Petty, regional Vice-President of

the Pan American Mining Corporation;

and, of course, our friend Mr.

Robert Allen, of South American

Sugar.  Mr. Nash of the American

State Department.  And Mr. Hyman

Roth of Miami, and Michael Corleone

of Nevada representing our

Associates in Tourism and Leisure

Activities.

LEON

The President would like to take

this opportunity to thank U T&T for

their lovely gift: a solid gold

telephone!  He thought all you

gentlemen would care to take a look

at it.

CORNGOLD

Your Excellency, perhaps you could

discuss the status of rebel activity

and how this may affect our

businesses.

LEON (O.S.)

Of course.  The rebel movement is

basically unpopular, and since July

of 1958 has been contained in the

Oriente Province, in the mountains

of the Sierra Muestre.

LEON

(continuing)

We began a highly successful

offensive against them in March,

and activities within the city

itself are at a minimum.  I can

assure you we'll tolerate no

guerrillas in the casinos or

swimming pools!

DRIVER

He says it will just be a short

time and they'll let us through.

SAM ROTH (O.S.)

Rum... Coca Cola...a squeeze of

fresh lime...

MAN

Cuba Libres.

MICHAEL

I was told the Cubans now call this

drink: "La Mentira."

ROTH

I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.

MICHAEL

It means... "The Lie."

SAM ROTH

The cake is here.

EVERYONE

(ad lib)

Happy Birthday!

ROTH

I hope my age is correct: I am

always accurate about my age.

ROTH

Everything we've learned in Vegas

is true here; but we can go further.

The bigger, the swankier, the

plusher the store, the more a sense

of legitimacy, and the bigger

business we do.

(looking at the plate

brought to him)

A smaller piece.  What we've

proposed to the Cuban Government is

that it put up half the cash on a

dollar for dollar basis.

(accepting a smaller piece)

Thank you.  We can find people in

the United States who will put up

our share for a small piece of the

action, yet we will retain control.

ONE OF THE MEN

How much?

ROTH

A hundred million dollars.  But

only if this Government relaxes its

restrictions on importing building

materials; we'll need some new

laws, too, but that will be no

difficulty.

ANOTHER MAN

What are import duties now?

ROTH

As much as seventy percent.  Also,

I'm working out an arrangement with

the Minister of Labor so that all

our pit bosses, stick-men and

Dealers, can be considered

specialized technicians eligible

for two year visas.  As of now

they're only allowed in Cuba for

six months at a time.  In short,

we're in a full partnership with

the Cuban Government.

ROTH

(continuing)

Here are applications from Friends

all over the States.  I understand

Santo Virgilio in Tampa is trying

to make his own deal.  Well, the

Cuban Government will brush him off.

The Lakeville Road Boys are going

to take over the Nacionale here.

I'm planning a new hotel casino to

be known as Riviera.  The new Capri

will go to the Corleone Family.

ROTH

Then there's the Sevilla Biltmore;

the Havana Hilton, which is going

to cost twenty-four million --

Cuban banks will put up half, the

Teamsters will bankroll the rest.

Generally, there will be friends

for all our friends including the

Lieutenant Governor of Nevada;

Eddie Levine of Newport will bring

in the Pennino Brothers, Dino and

Eddie; they'll handle actual casino

operations.

ROTH

Enjoy.

MICHAEL

I saw an interesting thing today.

A man was being arrested by the

Military Police; probably an urban

guerrilla.  Rather than be taken

alive, he exploded a grenade hidden

in his jacket, taking the command

vehicle with him.

MICHAEL

It occurred to me: the police are

paid to fight, and the Rebels are

not.

SAM ROTH

So?

MICHAEL

So, that occurred to me.

ROTH

This country has had rebels for the

last fifty years; it's part of

their blood.  Believe me, I know...

I've been coming here since the

twenties; we were running molasses

out of Havana when you were a baby.

To trucks owned by your father.

(he chuckles warmly

over the memory)

We'll talk when we're alone.

ROTH

You have to be careful what you say

in front of the others... they

frighten easy.  It's always been

that way, most men frighten easy.

MICHAEL

We're making a big investment in

Cuba.  That's my only concern.

ROTH

My concern is that the three

million never arrived at Batista's

numbered account in Switzerland.

He thinks it's because you have

second thoughts about his ability

to stop the rebels.

MICHAEL

The money was sent.

ROTH

Then you have to trace it.  Michael,

people here look at me as a reliable

man.  I can't afford not to be

looked on as a reliable man.  But

you know all that; there's nothing

you can learn from me.  You

shouldn't have to put up with a

sick old man as a partner.

MICHAEL

I wouldn't consider anyone else.

ROTH

Except the President of the United

States.

ROTH

If only I could live to see it,

kid; to be there with you.  How

beautifully we've done it, step by

step.  Here, protected, free to

make our profits without the

Justice Department, the FBI; ninety

miles away in partnership with a

friendly government.  Ninety miles,

just a small step, looking for a

man who desperately wants to be

President of the United States, and

having the cash to make it possible.

MICHAEL

You'll be there to see it; you'll

be there.

OPERATOR

We have your call to Tahoe, Nevada,

sir.

MICHAEL

Thank you.

(click, click)

Tom?  Tom, is that you?

ROCCO (O.S.)

No, Tom's out of town.  This is

Rocco.  Who is this?

KAY

I'm not surprised to see you, Tom.

KAY (O.S.)

I can't love a man like that; I

can't live with him, I can't let

him be father to my children.  Look.

KAY

He's not like a little boy... he

doesn't talk to me; he doesn't want

to play; he doesn't like other

children, he doesn't like toys.

It's as though he's waiting for the

time he can take his Father's place.

(almost in tears)

You know what he told me when he

was four years old.  He said he had

killed his Grandfather...

KAY

... He said he had shot his

Grandfather with a gun, and then he

died in the garden.  And he asked

me... he asked me, Tom, if that

meant now his father would shoot

him out of... revenge.

(she cries)

How does a four year old boy learn

the word... 'revenge'?

HAGEN

Kay... Kay...

KAY

What kind of a family is this...

are we human beings?  He knows his

Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He

heard Connie.

HAGEN

You don't know that's true.  But

Kay, just for the sake of an

argument, let's assume it is, I'm

not saying it is, remember, but...

What if I gave you what might be

some justification for what he

did... or rather some possible

justification for what he possibly

did.

KAY

That's the first time I've seen the

lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not

your best side.

HAGEN

Okay, just hear me out.  What if

Carlo had been paid to help get

Sonny killed?  What if his beating

of Connie that time was a deliberate

plot to get Sonny out into the open?

Then what?  And what if the Don, a

great man, couldn't bring himself

to do what he had to do, avenge his

son's death by killing his

daughter's husband?  What if that,

finally, was too much for him, and

he made Michael his successor,

knowing that Michael would take

that load off his shoulders, would

take that guilt?

KAY

He's not the same as when I met him.

HAGEN

If he were, he'd be dead by now.

You'd be a widow.  You'd have no

problem.

KAY

What the hell does that mean?  Come

on, Tom, speak out straight once in

your life.  I know Michael can't,

but you're not Sicilian, you can

tell a woman the truth; you can

treat her like an equal, a fellow

human being.

HAGEN

If you told Michael what I've told

you today, I'm a dead man.

KAY

When is it finally over?  I want it

to be over before my baby is born.

HAGEN

I don't know.  I hope soon; but

it's not over yet, and that's why

you and the kids have to come back

to me.

LOUDSPEAKER

Mr. Corleone; Mr. Freddie Corleone,

telephone please.

PIT BOSS

Not here.

LOUDSPEAKER

Telephone for Mr. Corleone.

NERI

He's backstage.

(and hangs up disgustedly)

FREDO

C'mon, you got fifteen minutes

before the finale!  I want to show

you a trick with feathers.

STAGEHAND

Phone for you.

FREDO

Don't go away; wait a minute.

FREDO

(on the phone)

Yeah.  Okay.  Who?  Mikey?  But...

Si... si, caposco.

(in Sicilian)

Sure... how much?  I understand.

Jesus, three million... I won't let

you down.  Sure.

ONE OF THE GIRLS

Freddie; we still got twelve

minutes before the finale!

FREDO

Yeah... some other time.

PENTANGELI

Wait in the car.

PENTANGELI

What's this?

ROSATO

That's a lucky C note for our new

deal.

ROSATO

We were all real happy about your

decision, Frankie; you're not goin'

to regret it.

PENTANGELI

I don't like the C-note.  I take it

like an insult.

ROSATO

Shit, your friend the cop!

COP

Everything all right in there,

Ritchie?  The door was open.

RITCHIE

Just cleaning up.

(strained voice)

You okay?

COP

Is that something on the floor?

ROSATO

Take him!

VOICE

Okay.

RITCHIE

Not here; not a cop, not here!

COP

(shouting to his

partner, in uniform)

Stutz!  Watch out, Stutz!

PENTANGELI

The bastard.  The dirty bastard, he

gave me a C-note.  He gave me a C-

note.

SERGEANT

Frankie Pentangeli murder attempt.

Patrolman Stutz shot.  Sahara

Lounge - Utica Avenue and Claredon

Road.  White Cadillac three or four

men took off from scene.  Need

ambulance; Stutz is bad.  Taking

Pentangeli into custody...

ROTH

Make it fast; I don't want to

chance him being seen.

COURIER

(frightened)

What about the arrangements?  How

can I be sure about the arrangements?

OLA

Relax.  You're under our protection;

the Corleone family will never find

you.

COURIER

Hey, what's this?

COURIER

The arrangements... YOU BASTARDS!

What...

FREDO

Mikey.  How are you?

FREDO

Hiya, Freddie Corleone.

MICHAEL

Mio fratello.

FREDO

(taking off his jacket)

What a trip, Jesus Christ, the

whole time I'm thinking what if

someone knew what I got in here.

FREDO

Oh, 'scuse me.

MICHAEL

It's all right.  He stays with me

all the time.

FREDO

Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally

in the dark.

MICHAEL

We're making an investment in Havana.

FREDO

Great, Havana's great.  Lots of

activity in Havana!  Anybody I know

here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?

MICHAEL

Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.

FREDO

I never met them.

MICHAEL

Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed

by the Rosato Brothers.

(pause)

Didn't you know that?

FREDO

No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me

anything?  I been kept in the dark

so long, I'm getting used to it.

MICHAEL

I want you to help me, Fredo.

FREDO

That's what I'm here for.

MICHAEL

Tonight I want to relax with you.

The Senator from Nevada is here

with some people from Washington.

I want to show them a good time in

Havana.

FREDO

Count on me; that's my specialty.

MICHAEL

I'd like to come along.  There's

been a lot of strain, and I've been

cooped up in this room for three

days.

FREDO

Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour

to wash my face and do my research

and we'll have these Washington

suckers right where you want 'em.

(then a thought

strikes him)

Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He

always wanted to die in bed...with

a broad.

DOCTOR

(Spanish)

You must not exert yourself; I will

write out a prescription and come

back tomorrow.

HOTEL MAN

He's going to write a prescription.

ROTH

I want my own doctor; fly him in

from Miami.  I don't trust a doctor

who can't speak English.

ROTH

Honey, go down to the casino?

TERRI

If you feel better...

ROTH

I do.  Play the Bingo game.

ROTH

My sixth sense tells me you have a

bag full of money in your hand.

MICHAEL

This doubles my investment.

ROTH

Still no word of your courier?

We'll find him.  But at least this

will satisfy our friends here.

You've been invited to the New Year

reception at the Presidential Home.

I understand your brother is here

as well; I hope he'll come.

MICHAEL

Six million dollars in cash is a

high price for a piece of a country

in the middle of a revolution.

ROTH

You're a careful kid, and that's

good.  But look.  An international

dispatch on the wire service.

American journalism, not propaganda.

The government troops have all but

eliminated the rebels.  All but

their radio station.

MICHAEL

I've read it; I'm pleased that the

government is doing so well.  As a

heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How

did the doctor find you?

ROTH

Terrible.  I'd give twice this

amount to take a piss without it

hurting.

MICHAEL

Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?

ROTH

(taken a bit off-balance)

Why...the Rosato Brothers.

MICHAEL

I know that; but who gave the go

ahead.

MICHAEL

I know it wasn't me...so that

leaves you.

ROTH

There was this kid that I grew up

with; he was a couple years younger

than me, and sort of looked up to

me, you know.  We did our first

work together, worked our way out

of the street.  Things were good

and we made the most of it.  During

prohibition, we ran molasses up to

Canada and made a fortune; your

father too.  I guess as much as

anyone, I loved him and trusted him.

Later on he had an idea to make a

city out of a desert stop-over for

G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast.

That kid's name was Moe Greene, and

the city he invented was Las Vegas.

This was a great man; a man with

vision and guts; and there isn't

even a plaque or a signpost or a

statue of him in that town.  Someone

put a bullet through his eye; no

one knows who gave the order.  When

I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I

knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong,

and talking loud, and saying stupid

things.  So when he turned up dead,

I let it go, and said to myself:

this is the business we've chosen.

I never asked, who gave the go

ahead because it had nothing to do

with business.

ROTH

(continuing)

There's three million dollars on

that table.  I'm going to lie down,

maybe take a nap.  When I wake up,

if it's still there, I'll know I

have a partner.  If it's gone, then

I'll know I don't.

MICHAEL

(Sicilian)

How sick do you think the old man is?

BUSSETTA

(Sicilian)

He'll live longer than me.

FREDO

Does everyone know everyone, or

nobody knows nobody.  Here, my

brother, Michael Corleone... well,

you know Senator Geary.

SENATOR GEARY

Good to see you, Mike; I'm glad we

can spend this time together.

FREDO

This is Senator Payton from Florida;

Judge DeMalco from New York...

Senator Ream... Mr. Questadt from

California, he's a lawyer with the

Price-Control Administration.  And

Fred Corngold of U T&T.

FREDO

Gentlemen... your pleasure?  Cuba

Libres, Pina Coladas, you name it.

SENATOR GEARY

I'll take a Yolanda.

FREDO

Later, later.  All those girls look

like they're on stilts!

SENATOR GEARY

To a night in Havana!

FREDO

(aside to Michael)

Jeeze, it's great you came along,

Mike... You know, we've never spent

a night out on the town together.

I always thought you looked down on

me for liking a good time.

MICHAEL

I never looked down on you, Fredo.

You don't look down at a brother.

CORNGOLD

Our information is that Castro is

dead.  There are maybe a few

hundred die-hards in the Sierra

Muestra; but government troops are

going to clean them out any day.

OLA

Mike, can I talk to you.

OLA

Listen, this Senator from Florida

already has a hundred grand worth

of markers on the table.

OLA

They asked him to sign paper to

take down the markers; but he got

mad; told them to wait until he was

finished.

MICHAEL

Let him gamble.

OLA

Okay.  You know he doesn't have

that kind of money.

FREDO

Mike said let him gamble.

FREDO

Mike, I got something special up my

sleeve for these boys.  You ever

hear of "Superman?" And I don't

mean the comic book.

MICHAEL

No.

FREDO

Wait'll you see!

FREDO

Mikey, why would they ever hit poor

old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved

that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember

when he was just a 'button,' when

we were kids.  We used to put

bedsheets on our heads, you know,

like we were ghosts.  An' ole

Frankie come peek into our room,

we'd jump up, and he'd always

pretend like he was really scared.

You remember?

MICHAEL

It was hard to have him killed.

FREDO

You?  What do you mean you, I

thought...

MICHAEL

It was hard to have him killed.

FREDO

You?  What do you mean you, I

thought...

MICHAEL

It was Frankie tried to have me hit.

FREDO

No.  I mean, are you sure?

MICHAEL

You know otherwise, Freddie?

FREDO

Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything.

Fellas!  You're all falling asleep.

We got to see Superman.

SENATOR REAM

(pushing away from

the palm outstretched

little hands of the boys)

Goddamn beggers.  Goddamn city of

beggars and pimps and whores.  And

we bend over backwards to support

them with the goddamn sugar quota.

FREDO

(to Geary)

What's eating him?

SENATOR GEARY

He lost a quarter million dollars

at the casino.

SENATOR REAM

...goddamn city of whores...

SENATOR GEARY

He gave them a bad check.

QUESTADT

Why do we have to stand?

FREDO

Everyone stands.  But it's worth

it, watch!

FREDO

That's him; that's Superman!

SENATOR GEARY

Ohmygod.  I don't believe it.

QUESTADT

It's got to be fake.

FREDO

That's why they call him Superman.

Johnny Ola told me about this; I

didn't believe it.

FREDO (O.S.)

... but seeing is believing.  Ole

Johnny knows all the places.  I

tol' you... can you believe it?

FREDO

(continuing)

The old man Roth, would never come;

but Johnny knows these places like

the back of his hand...

FADE OUT.

RADIO

(Spanish)

"This is Rebel Radio: Rebel troops

of Column Four 'Jose Marti' took

the town of Baire yesterday at 8:30

p.m.  The enemy has retreated..."

RADIO

(Spanish)

(continuing)

... An important military action is

developing along a 35-kilometer

stretch of the Central Highway.

Numerous enemy garrisons are left

with two alternatives, surrender or

annihilation...

RADIO

(continuing)

... Victories in war depend on a

minimum on weapons and to a maximum

on morale...

RADIO

... War is not a simple question of

rifles, bullets, guns and planes...

MICHAEL

How is your wife, Fredo...your

marriage?

FREDO

(eating)

You know her; drives me crazy, one

minute she's a popsicle, the next

she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I

think... I think - I should a

married someone, like you did.  To

have kids, to have a family.

MICHAEL

"Yo soy un hombre sincero..."

I am a sincere man,

From the land of the palms...

FREDO

What's that?

MICHAEL

The song.  Are you sincere with me,

Fredo?

FREDO

Sincere.  What are you talking

about, of course I'm sincere with

you, Mike.

MICHAEL

Then I'm going to confide in you;

trust you with something.

FREDO

(Sicilian)

Mike, are you crazy, I'm your

brother.

MICHAEL

Tonight we've been invited to a

reception at the Presidential

Palace; to bring in the New Year.

You and I will go in a special car

that's being sent.  They'll have

cocktails... then dinner, and a

reception with the President.  When

it's over, it will be suggested

that you take Questadt and his

friends from Washington to spend

the night with some women.  I'll go

home alone in the car; and before I

reach the hotel, I'll be

assassinated.

FREDO

...Who?

MICHAEL

The same man who tried in Nevada...

Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

FREDO

But, you told me yourself...

MICHAEL

It was never Pentangeli... I've

always known that.  It was Roth all

along.  He talks to me as a son; as

his successor, but the old man

thinks he'll live forever.

FREDO

What do you want me to do?

MICHAEL

To go tonight, with me, as though

we know nothing.  I've already made

my move.

FREDO

What is it?  Can I help?

MICHAEL

The old man will never bring in the

New Year.

QUESTADT

The embargo on arms shipments from

the U.S. to your government, was

just a necessary public relations

move... Only last month, your air

force received a major shipment of

rockets...

SENATOR GEARY

We believe in non-intervention...

but the agreement stipulates that

our forces may be withdrawn... but

as you've seen, we have not

withdrawn them.

CORNGOLD

And my guess is that President

Eisenhower won't pull out while we

have over three billion invested

over here.

MICHAEL

Fredo.  Where are you going?

FREDO

Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a

refill.  How about you?

QUESTADT

What's kept Mr. Roth?

MICHAEL

I've arranged for a plane; we're

going to Miami in an hour.  Try not

to make a big thing of it.

MICHAEL

(Sicilian)

I know it was you, Fredo.  You've

broken my heart.

LEON

What a pity; she's crying.  Must

have been fired, and she's been

with the President's family for

twenty years.

PRESIDENT

...Because of serious setbacks of

our troops in Guantanamo and

Santiago, we feel reluctantly, that

we must leave the Capital at once.

Myself and my family must bid you

goodbye, and good fortune.  We will

go directly to Ciudad Trujillo.

PRESIDENT

...My only regret is that there

could not have been more warning...

As my last official act as

President, I hereby appoint a

provisional government with Dr.

Carlos M. Piedra, as its President.

MICHAEL

Come with me.  It's your only way

of getting out!

PILOT

No, this is a private plane.  No,

this plane is taken.

MICHAEL

He isn't here.

PILOT

We've got to leave, they'll take

this thing apart.

MICHAEL

All right.  Go now.

VENDOR

No, no.  It is my pleasure to make

this a gift.

VITO

You are kind.  If ever I can do

something for you, in return,

please come to me.

VITO

(Sicilian)

What is it?

CARMELLA

(Sicilian)

Come...

CARMELLA

The Signora is a friend of mine.

She has a favor to ask of you.

VITO

(Sicilian)

Why do you come to me?

SIGNORA COLOMBO

(Sicilian)

She told me to ask you.

CARMELLA

She is having some trouble.  Her

landlord has received complaints

because of her dog.  He told her to

get rid of it, but her boy loved

it, so they tried to hide it.  When

the landlord found out, he was so

angry, he ordered her to leave.

Even if she truly will let the dog

go.

SIGNORA COLOMBO

(Sicilian)

He said he would have the police

put us out.

VITO

(thoughtfully)

I can give you some money to help

you move, is that what you want?

SIGNORA COLOMBO

My friends are all here; how can I

move to another neighborhood with

strangers?  I want you to speak to

the landlord to let me stay.

VITO

It's done then.  You won't have to

move; I'll speak to him tomorrow

morning.

SIGNORA COLOMBO

You're sure he'll say yes, the

landlord?

VITO

I'm sure he's a good-hearted fellow.

Once I explain how things are with

you, I'm sure he'll take pity on

your misfortunes.  Don't let it

trouble you any more.

(as he shows her out)

Guard your health, for the sake of

your children.

VITO (O.S.)

Signore Roberto...

VITO

The friend of my wife, a poor widow

with no man to protect her, tells

me that for some reason she has

been ordered to move from your

building.  She is in despair.  She

has no money, she has no friends

except those that live here.

ROBERTO

I have already rented the apartment

to another family.

VITO

I told her I would speak to you,

that you are a reasonable man who

acted out of some misunderstanding.

She has gotten rid of the animal

that caused all the trouble, so why

shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian

to another, I ask you the favor.

ROBERTO

I've already rented it; I cannot

disappoint the new tenants.  They're

paying a higher rent.

VITO

How much more a month?

ROBERTO

Eh...

(we sense he is lying)

Five dollars more.

VITO

Here is the six month's increase in

advance.  You needn't speak to her

about it, she's a proud woman.  See

me again in another six months.

But of course, you'll let her keep

her dog.

ROBERTO

Like hell!  And who the hell are

you to give me orders.  Watch your

manners or you'll be on your

Sicilian ass in the street there.

VITO

I'm asking you a favor, only that.

One never knows when one might need

a friend, isn't that true?  Here,

take this money as a sign of my

good-will, and make your own

decision.  I won't quarrel with it.

(he puts the money in

Roberto's hand)

Do me this little favor, just take

it and think carefully.  Tomorrow

morning if you want to give me the

money back, by all means do so.  If

you want the woman out of your

house, how can I stop you?  It's

your property, after all.  If you

don't want the dog in there, I can

understand.  I dislike dogs myself.

(he pats Roberto on

the shoulder)

Do me this service, eh?  I won't

forget it.  Ask your friends in

this neighborhood about me, they'll

tell you I'm a man who believes in

showing his gratitude.

ITALIAN BOY

Kid, where do you live?

ANOTHER

Where'd you get those nigger lips?

ITALIAN BOY

Say 'bread' in Italian.

ANOTHER

He dunno.

ITALIAN BOY

Go on; how do you say 'bread' in

Italian?  If you're from the

neighborhood, you should know how

to say 'bread' in Italian.

CLEMENZA

What's up?

ITALIAN BOY

This kid lives around here, but he

can't say bread in Italian.

CLEMENZA

That's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at

those pregnant lips!

ITALIAN BOY

Are you a Jewboy?

ITALIAN BOY

Well, if you're not a Jew, say

'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't.

CLEMENZA

Alright, alright, cut it out.

SECOND ITALIAN

What for?  He killed Jesus Christ!

CLEMENZA

I said cut it out!

(to the beaten kid)

What's your name?

HYMAN

Hyman Suchowsky.

ITALIAN BOY

I don't believe it.  In our

neighborhood, with a name like that!

CLEMENZA

What are those tools?  You work on

cars?

HYMAN

Yeah.

CLEMENZA

Maybe I know how you can make a

couple of extra bucks working as a

mechanic.

CLEMENZA

But you gotta know how to keep your

mouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get

rid of that name.  I'll call you

Johnny Lips.

(he giggles at his

own humor again)

Come on...

CLEMENZA

Bread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E,

pane.  Don't forget.

GENCO

(Sicilian)

The 'patrone' is here.

VITO

Chi?

GENCO

Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'

ROBERTO

Excuse me, I hope I am not a

disturbance, Don Corleone.

VITO

Yes.

ROBERTO

What a terrible misunderstanding.

Of course, Signora Colombo can stay

in the flat.  Who were those

miserable tenants to complain about

noise from a poor animal...when

they pay such low rent.

ROBERTO

Your good heart in helping the poor

widow has shamed me, and I want to

show that I, too, have some

Christian charity.  Her rent will

remain what it was.

VITO

What was that?

ROBERTO

In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!

VITO

I accept your generosity...

ROBERTO

I won't keep you another minute...

GENCO

We won't see him for weeks!  He'll

stay in bed in the Bronx!

CLEMENZA

This kid is good with cars; he

kiijed at the truck, and says he

can keep it going.

CLEMENZA

What's your name?

HYMAN

Suchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky.

CLEMENZA

He's gonna dump that; I call him

Johnny Lips.

VITO

Who is the greatest man you can

think of?

CLEMENZA

Go on, answer him when he talks to

you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi...

Garibaldi.

HYMAN

Arnold Rothstein.

VITO

Then take that as your name: Hyman

Rothstein.

GENCO

Vitone!  Look at this!

GENCO

(enthusiastically)

God bless America!  We're in

business!

DISSOLVE TO:

SENATOR (O.S.)

Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to

the present time, you were an

employee of the "Genco Olive Oil

Company."

CICCI

That's right.

SENATOR (O.S.)

But in actuality, you were a member

of the Corleone Crime organization.

CICCI

The Corleone Family, Senator.  We

called it, "The Family."

SENATOR (O.S.)

What position did you occupy?

CICCI

At first, like everybody, I was a

soldier.

SENATOR KANE

What is that exactly?

CICCI

A button.  You know, Senator.

SENATOR KANE

No, I don't know, explain that

exactly.

CICCI

When the boss says push the button

on a guy, I push the button, see,

Senator?

QUESTADT

You mean you killed people at the

behest of your superiors?

CICCI

That's right, counsellor.

QUESTADT

And the head of your family was

Michael Corleone.

CICCI

Yeah, counsellor, Michael Corleone.

SENATOR KANE

Did you ever get such an order

directly from Michael Corleone?

CICCI

No, Senator, I never talked to him.

SENATOR SAVOY

(very autocratic,

deep South,

gentlemanly man)

There was always a buffer, someone

in between you who gave you orders.

CICCI

Yeah, a buffer, the Family had a

lot of buffers.

MICHAEL

Do you think they have somebody to

back up Cicci?

HAGEN

No.  But if they do have somebody,

you'll do three years for perjury

if you give them so much as a wrong

middle name.

HAGEN

Michael, take the Fifth all the

way, that way you can't get into

trouble.

MICHAEL

Al, get me a wet towel.  Does Kay

know I'm back?

MICHAEL

Did the boy get something from me

for Christmas?

HAGEN

I took care of it.

MICHAEL

What was it, so I'll know.

HAGEN

A little care he can ride in with

an electric motor.

MICHAEL

Fellas, can you wait outside a

minute?

MICHAEL

Where's my brother?

HAGEN

Roth got out on a private boat.

He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a

stroke but he's recovered okay.

Bussetta's dead.

MICHAEL

I asked about Fredo?

HAGEN

The new government arrested him,

held him for a couple of days with

a lot of the other casino people,

including Roth's brother, Sam.  The

American Embassy arranged flights

for citizens; I'm not sure, but I

think he's somewhere in New York.

MICHAEL

I want you to reach Fredo.  I know

he's scared, but have one of our

people reach him.  Assure him that

there will be no reprisals.  Tell

him that I know Roth misled him.

HAGEN

My information is that Fredo

thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth

assured him nothing would happen to

you.

MICHAEL

(indicating Rocco and

Neri on the balcony)

They can come in now.

HAGEN

Wait... there's something else.

MICHAEL

Alright.

MICHAEL

(impatiently)

Go on, tell me.

HAGEN

Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the

baby.

MICHAEL

Was it a boy or a girl?

HAGEN

Mike, at three and a half...

MICHAEL

What is it, can't you give me

straight answers anymore!

HAGEN

It was a boy.

MICHAEL

And Kay...she's all right?

HAGEN

She took the Senate Investigation

worse.

MICHAEL

Does she blame it on me?  The baby?

HAGEN

I don't know.

MICHAEL

Mom... Mom...

MICHAEL

(Sicilian)

It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?

MAMA

(Sicilian)

I'm alright.  Will you stay home

for awhile?

MICHAEL

(Sicilian)

There are still things I have to do.

MAMA

(Sicilian)

Well, we can all have a nice dinner

together tonight.  How are your eyes?

MICHAEL

Alright.  They bother me once in

awhile.

(a pause as he thinks)

Tell me, when Pop had troubles...

did he ever think, even to himself,

that he had gone the wrong way;

that maybe by trying to be strong

and trying to protect his family,

that he could... that he could...

lose it instead?

MAMA

(Sicilian)

You talk about the baby.  She can

have another baby.

MICHAEL

(Sicilian)

No, I meant lose his family.

MAMA

(as best she ever

understood it)

Your family?  How can you ever lose

your family?

MICHAEL

(almost to himself)

But times are different...

DISSOLVE TO:

TOMASINO

(Sicilian)

Don Francesco, if you will honor

me, by allowing me to introduce my

associate in America, in New York.

His name is Vito Corleone.

TOMASINO

We will supply him with olive oil

exclusively in the town of Corleone.

His company is called the "Genco

Olive Oil Company." Here we have

brought you an indication of how he

will sell the product.

TOMASINO

(Sicilian)

We have come to ask your blessing

and permission to continue this

enterprise.

DON FRANCESCO

(Sicilian)

(in a shrill, high,

raspy voice)

Where is this young man?

TOMASINO

He is right here, standing next to

me, Don Francesco.

DON FRANCESCO

(Sicilian)

Have him come closer, I can't see

very well.

DON FRANCESCO

(Sicilian)

What is your name?

VITO

(Sicilian)

Vito Corleone.

DON FRANCESCO

(Sicilian)

You took the name of this town, eh?

What was your father's name?

VITO

(Sicilian)

Antonio Andolini.

DON FRANCESCO

(Sicilian)

Kill him!  Kill him!

VITO

(Sicilian)

In the name of my Father, and my

Brother...

SENATOR KANE (O.S.)

Are you the son of Vito Corleone?

MICHAEL

Yes.

SENATOR KING

Did he use at times an alias?  Was

this alias in certain circles

GODFATHER?

MICHAEL

It was not an alias.  GODFATHER was

a term of affection, used by his

friends, one of respect.

SENATOR WEEKLER

(Senator from New

York, very smooth,

partly liberal,

Tammany Hall)

Let me agree with that.  Many of my

constituents are Italian and have

been honored with that certain

friendship by my close Italian

friends.  Up to this point before I

have to leave this hearing to join

my own committee, let me say, that

this hearing on the Mafia is in no

way a slur on the Italians by the

Senate; nor is it meant to be; nor

will I allow it to be.  Italian

Americans are the hardest working,

most law abiding patriotic Americans

of our country.  It is a shame and

a pity that a few rotten apples

give them a bad name.  We are here

to weed those rotten apples out of

the vast healthy barrel of Italian

Americans, who are one of the

backbones of our country.

SENATOR KANE

I'm sure we all agree with our

esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr.

Corleone, you have been advised as

to your legal rights.  We have had

testimony from a preceding witness

who states you are head of the most

powerful Mafia family in this

country.  Are you?

MICHAEL

No.

SENATOR KANE

This witness has testified that you

are personally responsible for the

murder of a New York Police Captain

in the year 1947 and with him a man

named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny

this?

MICHAEL

I deny his every charge.

SENATOR KANE

Is it true that in the year 1950

you devised the murder of the heads

of the Five Families in New York,

to assume and consolidate your

nefarious power?

MICHAEL

That is a complete falsehood.

SENATOR KANE

Is it true that you own a

controlling interest in three of

the major hotels in Las Vegas?

MICHAEL

That is not true.  I own some stock

in some of the hotels, but only

very small amounts.  I also own

some American Telephone and IBM

stock.

SENATOR ROGERS

Why is it necessary for your

counsel to advise you on that

question?

MICHAEL

Senator, I've observed the head of

General Motors before a Senate

Committee, and his lawyer whispered

in his ear.  That was not commented

upon in the way you have just done.

SENATOR KANE

Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel

interests in the state of Arizona?

Or any gambling interests in that

state?

MICHAEL

I do not.

SENATOR KANE

Do you have interests or control

over gambling and narcotics in the

state of New York.

MICHAEL

I do not.

HAGEN

Senator, my client would like to

read a statement for the record.

SENATOR KANE

I don't think that's necessary.

HAGEN

Sir, my client has answered every

question asked by this committee

with the utmost cooperation and

sincerity.  He has not taken that

Fifth Amendment as it was his right

to do, and which because of the

extreme legal complexity of this

hearing, counsel advised him to do.

So, I think in all fairness this

committee should hear his statement

and put it in the record.

SENATOR KANE

Very well.

MICHAEL

(reading)

In the hopes of clearing my family

name, in the sincere desire to give

my children their fair share of the

American way of life without a

blemish on their name and background

I have appeared before this

committee and given it all the

cooperation in my power.  I consider

my being called before this

committee an act of prejudice to

all Americans of Italian extraction.

I consider it a great dishonor to

me personally to have to deny that

I am a criminal.  I wish to have

the following noted for the record.

That I served my country faithfully

and honorably in World War II and

was awarded the Distinguished

Service Cross for actions in

defense of my country.  That I have

never been arrested or indicted for

any crime whatsoever... that no

proof linking me to any criminal

conspiracy, whether it is called

Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever

other name you wish to give, has

ever been made public.  Only one

man has made charges against me,

and that man is known to be a

murderer, arsonist and rapist.  And

yet this committee had used this

person to besmirch my name.  My

personal protest can only be made

to the people of this country.  I

can only thank God that in this

country we have a legal system and

courts of law to protect innocent

people from wild accusation.  I

thank God for our democratic due

process of Law that shields me from

the false charges made by this

committee's witness.  I have not

taken refuge behind the Fifth

Amendment, though counsel advised

me to do so.  I challenge this

committee to produce any witness or

evidence against me, and if they do

not, I hope they will have the

decency to clear my name with the

same publicity with which they have

now besmirched it.  I ask this

without malice, in the interests of

fair play.

SENATOR ROGERS

We are all impressed.  The committee

will now recess over the weekend.

However, it will continue Monday

morning, at eleven a.m.  At that

time, this committee will then

produce a witness directly linking

Mr. Corleone to the charges we have

made.  And then, Mr. Corleone may

very well by liable for indictments

of perjury.  However, this document

will be made a matter of record.

PENTANGELI

Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to

one shot in my favor, and I lose.

FBI MAN #1

Get a good night's sleep.  We got a

new suit, new shirt, new tie, and

I'm going to shave you myself.

Tomorrow we want you to look

respectable for fifty million of

your fellow Americans.

PENTANGELI

My life won't be worth a nickel

after tomorrow.

FBI MAN #1

We have a special home for you for

the rest of your life.  Nobody gets

near you.  You're not going any

place.

PENTANGELI

Yeah, some deal I made.

FBI MAN #2

You live like a king.  You'll be a

hero.  You'll live better in here

than most people on the outside.

PENTANGELI

Some deal.

(pause)

I just wish Mike had took the Fifth.

FBI MAN #1

Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After

all these years, why'd you turn

against him?

PENTANGELI

I didn't turn against nobody; he

turned against me.

MICHAEL

How did they get their hands on

Pentangeli?

HAGEN

Roth engineered it, Michael.  He

made Pentangeli think you hit him.

Deliberately letting him get off

alive.  Then the New York detectives

turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My

informants say he was half dead and

scared stiff -- talking out loud

that you had turned on him and

tried to kill him.  Anyway, they

had him on possession, dealing in

heroin, murder one and a lot more.

There's no way we can get to him

and you've opened yourself to five

points of perjury.

NERI

They've got him airtight.  He's in

a military base, twenty-four hour

guards.  Trying to kill him is like

trying to like the President --

it's impossible.

MICHAEL

What does Fredo know?

HAGEN

He says he doesn't know anything,

and I believe him.  Roth played

this one beautifully.

MICHAEL

Alright.  I'm going to go outside

and talk to Fredo.

FREDO

(after a pause)

I don't have a lot to say, Michael.

MICHAEL

We have time.

FREDO

I was kept pretty much in the dark.

I didn't know all that much.

MICHAEL

What about now, is there anything

you can help me out with?

FREDO

I know they get Pentangeli, that's

all I know.

FREDO

I didn't know it was a hit.  I

swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny

Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills --

said he wanted to talk.  He said

you and Roth were in on some big

deal, and there was a place for me

in it if I could help them out.

They said you were being tough on

the negotiation, and if they had a

little bit of help, they could

close it fast and it would be good

for you.

MICHAEL

And you believed that story.

FREDO

He said there was something good in

it for me...me on my own.

MICHAEL

I've always taken care of you.

FREDO

Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my

kid brother, and you take care of

my.  Did you ever think of that.

Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do

this, send Fredo to take care of

that... take care of some little

unimportant night club here, and

there; pick somebody up at the

airport.  Mike, I'm your older

brother; I was stepped over!

MICHAEL

It's the way Pop wanted it.

FREDO

It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I

can handle things.  I'm not dumb

Christ, not like everyone says.

I'm smart; and I want respect.

MICHAEL

There's nothing more you can tell

me about this investigation?

FREDO

The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to

Roth.

MICHAEL

You're nothing to me now, Fredo;

not a brother, not a friend, I

don't want to know you, or what

happens to you.  I don't want to

see you at the hotels, or near my

home.  When you visit our Mother, I

want to know a day in advance, so I

won't be there.  Do you understand?

FREDO

Mikey?

MICHAEL

I don't want anything to happen to

him while my Mother's alive.

FBI MAN #1

Ready, Frankie.

PENTANGELI

Let's go.

SENATOR KANE

We have here a witness who will

testify further on Michael

Corleone's rule of the criminal

empire that controls gambling in

this country and perhaps in other

countries.  This witness had no

buffer between himself and Michael

Corleone.  He can corroborate our

charges on enough counts for this

committee to consider a charge of

perjury against Michael Corleone.

(then he turns to Pentangeli)

Your name please, for the record.

PENTANGELI

Frank Pentangeli.

SENATOR KANE

Were you a member of the Corleone

Family?  Were you under the

Caporegime Peter Clemenza, under

Vito Corleone, known as the

Godfather?

PENTANGELI

I never knew no Godfather.  I got

my own family.

SENATOR KANE

Mr. Pentangeli, you are

contradicting your confessions to

our investigators; I ask you again,

were you a member of a crime

organization headed by Michael

Corleone?

PENTANGELI

No.  I never heard of it.  I never

heard of nothing like that.  I was

in the olive oil business with his

father a long time ago.  That's all.

SENATOR KANE

We have your confession that you

murdered on the orders of Michael

Corleone.  Do you deny that

confession and do you know what

denying that confession will mean

to you?

PENTANGELI

The FBI guys promised me a deal.

So I made up a lot of stuff about

Michael Corleone.  Because then,

that's what they wanted.  But it

was all lies.  Everything.  They

said Michael Corleone did this,

Michael Corleone did that.  So I

said, "Yeah, sure."

SENATOR KANE

Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify

to this committee that gentleman

sitting on your right hand?

HAGEN

(coolly)

Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo

Pentangeli.

SENATOR KANE

Is he related to the witness?

HAGEN

He is, I believe, a brother.

SENATOR KANE

(to Vincenzo Pentangeli)

Sir, I would like you to take the

stand.

HAGEN

Sir, the gentleman does not

understand English.  He would not

in any case, take the stand.  He

came, at his own expense, to aid

his brother in his trouble.  He is

not under any jurisdiction of our

government and his reputation in

his own country is impeccable.

SENATOR KANE

(furious)

The witness is excused; take him out.

HAGEN

Senator Kane.

SENATOR KANE

This meeting is adjourned.

HAGEN

(rising and shouting)

This committee owes an apology!

SENATOR KANE

The committee is adjourned until

further notice.

ROCCO

It's Kay.

MICHAEL

On the phone?

ROCCO

No, she's here.

MICHAEL

I had no idea...

KAY

I wanted to see you before you went

back to Nevada.  Also, the

children - Michael, they're here.

MICHAEL

Where?

KAY

In a minute.  They're outside with

Esther.  I'm very happy for you...

I suppose I knew that you're simply

too smart for anyone ever to beat

you.

MICHAEL

Why don't you sit down?

KAY

I'm not going to stay long; I can't.

MICHAEL

There are a lot of things I want to

talk to you about.  Things I've

been thinking about -- changes I

want to make.

KAY

I think it's too late for changes,

Michael.  I promised myself I

wouldn't talk about it and I've

gone and spoiled it.

MICHAEL

Why too late?

KAY

Tell me, Michael.  What really

happened with Pentangeli?

MICHAEL

His brother came to help him.

KAY

I didn't even know he had a brother.

And where is he now?

MICHAEL

On a plane back to Sicily.

KAY

And that's all he had to do.  Just

show his face.

MICHAEL

That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in

the old days... there was only one

legitimate reason to kill a blood

relative... only one.  IF he was a

traitor.

KAY

You would have killed his brother?

MICHAEL

Kay, you've got it wrong.  That

kind of thing's all over, I promised

you.  This was between the two

brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a

young girlfriend; he called her his

co-wife.  That was his joke, but he

meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his

wife... because she was a great

cook.  He said he girlfriend made a

spaghetti sauce once and it was so

terrible he knew he could never

marry her.  He set her up in a

house in Jersey.  She had to be

faithful... and she had to have kids.

And she did, two, a boy and a girl.

He had her checked out and watched

so she couldn't cheat... but the

girl couldn't stand that kind of

life.  She begged him to let her go.

He did.  He gave her money and made

her give up the kids.  Then Frankie

took them to Italy, and had them

brought up by his brother Vincenzo.

Where he knew they'd by safe.

MICHAEL

When he saw his brother in the

hearing room, he knew what was at

stake.

(pause)

I don't think Vincenzo would have

done it.  He loves the kids, too.

Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It

had nothing to do with me.  It was

between those brothers.

KAY

I'll bring the children up now;

they want to say goodbye.

MICHAEL

Kay, I told you...

KAY

Goodbye, Michael.

MICHAEL

I won't let you leave!  Christ, do

you think I'm going to let you leave.

KAY

(meekly)

Michael.

MICHAEL

No, I don't want to hear anything.

There are things between men and

women that will not change; things

that have been the same for

thousands of years.  You are my

wife, and they are my children...

and I love you and I will not let

you leave, because you are MINE!

KAY

Oh, I do feel things for you,

Michael; but now, I think it's pity.

For the first time since I've known

you, you seem so helpless.  You

held me a prisoner once; will you

try again?

MICHAEL

If that's what it takes; then yes,

I will.

KAY

At this moment, I feel no love for

you at all.  I never thought that

could happen, but it has.

MICHAEL

We'll go back tonight.  Bring the

children.

KAY

You haven't heard me.

MICHAEL

How can I let you leave; how can I

let you take my children away?

Don't you know me?  You understand,

it's an impossibility.  I would

never let it happen; no, never, not

if it took all my strength, all my

cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll

feel differently.  You see, you'll

be happy that I stopped you.  I

know you.  You'll forget about

this; you'll forget about the baby

we lost... and we'll go on, you and

I.

KAY

The baby I lost...

MICHAEL

I know what it meant... and I'm

prepared to make it up to you.  I

will make changes; I can.

(he clenches his fist tightly)

I CAN change; that I have learned,

that I have the strength to change...

And we have another child, a boy...

and you'll forget the miscarriage.

KAY

It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you

with your cunning, couldn't you

figure it out!  It was an abortion;

an abortion, like our marriage is

an abortion, something unholy and

evil.  I don't want your son; I

wouldn't bring another of your sons

into this world.  An abortion,

Michael... it was a son, and I had

it killed, but this must all end!

KAY

And I know that now it's over; I

knew it then, there would be no way

you could ever forgive me, not with

this Sicilian thing that goes back

two thousand years.

MICHAEL

(coldly)

You won't take my children.

FADE OUT.

FREDO

Tom.  Where's Mike?

HAGEN

(difficult to tell him)

He's waiting for you to leave.

FREDO

Can I talk to him?

HAGEN

No chance.  I'm sorry, Freddie.

CONNIE

(who has heard this)

Can I see him?

HAGEN

He's in the boathouse.

CONNIE (O.S.)

(quietly)

Michael?  It's Connie.

CONNIE

I want to stay close to home now,

is that alright?

CONNIE

Is Kay coming?

MICHAEL

No.

CONNIE

Michael, Fredo's in the house with

Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom

said he couldn't see you.

MICHAEL

Tom is right.

CONNIE

Kids, why don't you go outside for

a while?

CONNIE

I want to talk to you, Michael.

MICHAEL

The children can stay.

CONNIE

I hated you for so long, Michael;

for so many years.  I think I did

things to myself, to hurt myself,

so that you would know -- and you

would be hurt too.  But I understand

you now; I think I do.  You were

being strong for all of us, like

Papa was.  And I forgive you, and

want to be close to you now.  Can't

you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet,

and helpless without you.

CONNIE

You need me, Michael.  I want to be

with you now.

FREDO

Christ, Mike.  Jesus Christ, Mike.

SANDRA

You're going to talk to him now.

HAGEN

Yes.

SANDRA

Will you tell him?

HAGEN

I don't know.

SANDRA

Tom, think of yourself for once.

Don't let this opportunity slip

through your fingers; don't do it.

We're all trapped here, don't you

see?

MICHAEL

(without looking back)

Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard

about our friend and partner, Mr.

Hyman Roth?

HAGEN

I know he's in Israel.

NERI

(hands Hagen the paper)

The High Court of Israel turned

down his request to live as a

'returned Jew.' His passport's been

invalidated except for return to

the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires

yesterday, offered a gift of one

million dollars if they would give

him citizenship.  They turned him

down.

HAGEN

(reading)

He's going to try Panama...

MICHAEL

They won't take him; not for a

million, not for ten million.

HAGEN

His medical condition is reported

as... "terminal."

MICHAEL

He's been dying of the same heart

attack for twenty years.

HAGEN

That plane goes to Miami...

MICHAEL

I want it met.

HAGEN

(understanding)

Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be

met by the Internal Revenue; the

Customs Service, and half the FBI.

MICHAEL

I don't like it when you use the

word impossible; nothing is

impossible...

HAGEN

Mike, it would be like trying to

kill the President; there's no way

we can get to him.

MICHAEL

I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If

there's anything certain; certain

in life; if history has taught us

anything, it's that you can kill...

(he stops, then coldly)

ANYBODY.  But perhaps your

relucatance is because you've come

to tell me that you're moving your

family to Vegas, that you've been

offered the Vice-Presidency of the

Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't

you going to tell me at all?

HAGEN

Are you so hungry for traitors; do

you want to find them everywhere?

MICHAEL

They are everywhere!

HAGEN

I turned Houstan down; I didn't see

why I should tell you about an

offer I turned down.

(Michael begins to

confuse him)

Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure

of what we're doing; what we'll

gain; what does the family gain?

Forget that, Mike; I already know

the answer.

MICHAEL

I know you do, Tom.  Then I can

count on you to help me do the

things I have to do.  If not, call

Houstan, and become a Vice-President.

Take your family and your mistress

and move them to Las Vegas.

HAGEN

Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've

always been loyal to you.

MICHAEL

Good.  Then you're staying.

HAGEN

I'm staying.

(he pauses...then,

without being asked)

Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of

all this; Sonny never listened to

me about that.

(then he sits down,

and opens his briefcase)

Now, explain everything to me.

FREDO

Anthony, ole buddy, your Uncle

Fredo's gonna teach you how to

catch the big fish.  You know, when

I was a kid, I did this amazing

thing.  I went out on a fishing

trip; me and my brothers and my

Pop, and no one could catch a fish

except me.  And this was my secret:

(confidentially)

Every time I would put the line

down I would say a "Hail Mary" and

every time I said a "Hail Mary" I

would catch a fish.  Now, when it's

sunset, we're gonna go out on the

lake, and we're gonna try it.

HAGEN

I think I prefer to see my client

privately.

PENTANGELI

The room has a bug in it.

HAGEN

(to the FBI men)

I'd like to go outside with him, in

the open air.

FBI MAN #1

This room is not bugged.

HAGEN

You have guards outside and the

electric fence.  There's no security

reason for not letting us talk in

the yard.

FBI MAN #1

Okay.

HAGEN

Everything is going to be okay,

Frankie, don't worry.

PENTANGELI

Did my brother go back?

HAGEN

Yeah, but don't worry.

PENTANGELI

He's ten times tougher than me, my

brother.  He's old-fashioned.

HAGEN

Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to

dinner.  Just wanted to go home.

PENTANGELI

That's my brother.  Nothing could

get him away from that two mule

town.  He coulda been big over

here -- he could of had his own

Family.

HAGEN

You're right.

PENTANGELI

Tom, what do I do now?

HAGEN

Frankie, you were always interested

in politics, in history.  I remember

you talking about Hitler back in

'43.  We were young then.

PENTANGELI

Yeah, I still read a lot.  They

bring me stuff.

HAGEN

You were around the old timers who

dreamed up how the Families should

be organized, how they based it on

the old Roman Legions, and called

them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos'

and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.

PENTANGELI

Yeah, it worked.  Those were great

old days.  We was like the Roman

Empire.  The Corleone family was

like the Roman Empire.

HAGEN

(sadly)

Yeah, it was once.

HAGEN

(very gently)

The Roman Empire... when a plot

against the Emperor failed, the

plotters were always given a chance

to let their families keep their

fortunes.

PENTANGELI

Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The

little guys got knocked off.  If

they got arrested and executed, all

their estate went to the Emperor.

If they just went home and killed

themselves, up front, nothing

happened.

HAGEN

Yeah, that was a good break.  A

nice deal.

PENTANGELI

They went home and sat in a hot

bath and opened their veins, and

bled to death.  Sometimes they gave

a little party before they did it.

HAGEN

Don't worry about anything, Frankie

Five-Angels.

PENTANGELI

Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.

FBI MAN #1

Your lawyer tell you he can get

that 600 years reduced to 500?

PENTANGELI

You boys sure you can't get me a

broad for tonight?  Give me a

little party?

FBI MAN #2

We got some nice books.

PENTANGELI

I guess I'll just take a hot bath.

FREDO

Here we go; and remember the secret.

CONNIE (O.S.)

Anthony.

FREDO

He's here; we're goin' fishing.

CONNIE

He can't go; Michael wants to take

him into Reno.

FREDO

Ah.  Okay, kid, you got to go to

Reno with your Pop.

FREDO

I'll catch one for you, with the

secret.

CONNIE

Hurry, Anthony.

FBI MAN #1

Frankie, open up.  You okay?

DISSOLVE TO:

FREDO

... the Lord is with thee.  Blessed

art thou amongst women, and blessed

is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

FREDO

... Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray

for us...

DISSOLVE TO:

FBI MAN

Mr. Roth, we have to take you into

custody.

ROTH

Yes, I know.

REPORTER

Can you give us your reaction to

the High Court of Israel's ruling.

ROTH

I am a retired investor on a

pension, and I wished to live there

as a Jew  in the twilight of my

life...

LAWYER

Mr. Roth is not a well man; he's

tired of running.

ROTH

I'm an old man; at my age, it's too

late to start worrying.

REPORTER

Is it true you are worth over three

hundred million dollars, Mr. Roth?

ROTH

I'm a retired investor, living on a

pension... I came home to vote in

the Presidential election, because

they wouldn't give me an absentee

ballot...

FADE OUT.

CONNIE

Kay, you have to go.

CONNIE

You have to hurry; he's coming.

KAY

Anthony, kiss Mama goodbye.

CONNIE

(angrily)

Anthony, you kiss your Mother

goodbye!

KAY

Anthony, say goodbye; your Mama

loves you.

ANTHONY

Goodbye.

KAY

Anthony, kiss me once.

DISSOLVE TO:

CONNIE

Don't worry; I'm sure he got here

on time.  The roads from the

airport are so windy, it takes

forever; I've driven them myself.

CONNIE

I'll bring him out to you as soon

as he comes.

ANTHONY

Hello, Dad.

MICHAEL

Anthony.

MICHAEL

You've grown so tall... so tall in

the last year.  You're much taller

than me.

ANTHONY

I was taller than you when I was

fourteen.

MICHAEL

Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I

waited for you to have some lunch,

but now it's all dried out.

ANTHONY

I'm not hungry.

MICHAEL

Well, that's alright... alright.

Good.  You'll graduate in another

year, isn't that right?  You know...

I never finished college.  I was a

good student, but I never finished.

Of course, there was a war then.

CONNIE

Don't let me interrupt anything,

this will just take a second.  Here.

(she takes out a

small needle, and

begins to prepare it)

Your father has to have his insulin

shot.  Why don't you go to your

room and put your things away,

Anthony.

MICHAEL

Hurry back; we'll talk.  We'll talk.

CONNIE

Whenever I see that lake so cold, I

think of poor Fredo, drowned.  Lake

Tahoe is very cold.  They say if a

person drowns in it, that the body

will remain mid-suspended --

perfectly preserved.  Some say it

will remain forever.

CONNIE

Your boy will be right back.

DISSOLVE TO:

SONNY

Hey, who knows my buddy Carlo Rizzi.

Here... my brother Fredo, here's my

Mom.  Mom, whatcha got cooking?

And Carlo, this is my kid sister

Connie.  Here, pull up a chair,

Carol is sitting next to Connie.

Oh, the droopy kid over there is

Mike.  The college boy.

TESSIO

Buon Natale, everybody.  Buon

Natale...

(he smiles at Tom Hagen)

Hi, Tom, how's every little thing?

HAGEN

(helping him with the presents)

Wonderful, Sal.

DON CORLEONE

Is dinner ready?

MOM

Two minutes.

DON CORLEONE

A good life, a long life to all my

children, and friends.  To my

grandchildren, and those that will

be.  To our family.

TESSIO

To our Godfather.

SONNY

What'd you think of those Japs, eh?

The nerve of those Japs, coming

right here in our own backyard

dropping bombs!

HAGEN

Well, we could have expected it

after the embargo.

SONNY

Hey!  Expect it or not, those Japs

don't have a right to drop bombs in

our backyard.  Whose side you on?

MAMA

Please, do we have to talk about

the war at the table?  On Christmas,

much less.

MICHAEL

Pop, I've decided I'm going to

enlist.

SONNY

Kid, stay in college.  The girls

are cuter, if you know what I mean.

HAGEN

Pop had to pull a lot of strings to

get you your deferment.

MICHAEL

I never asked for it; I don't want

it.

DON CORLEONE

My son wants to talk about this,

and so we'll talk, but not at the

dinner table.

DON CORLEONE

Michael.

DON CORLEONE

Would you like some?

MICHAEL

No, Dad.

DON CORLEONE

Now what is this talk about joining

the army?  Eh?

MICHAEL

It's not talk; I'm doing it.

DON CORLEONE

You would risk your life for

strangers?

MICHAEL

Not for strangers; for my country.

DON CORLEONE

Anyone not in your family, is a

stranger.  Believe me, when trouble

comes, your country won't take care

of you.

MICHAEL

That's how it was in the old world,

Pop, but this is not Sicily.

DON CORLEONE

I know.  I know, Michael.  It's

Christmas, your brothers and sister

are all here -- we are happy.

Let's not spoil this.  Go your own

way, but when you are ready, come

to me the way a son should.  I have

hopes for you...

MICHAEL

I won't be a man like you.
