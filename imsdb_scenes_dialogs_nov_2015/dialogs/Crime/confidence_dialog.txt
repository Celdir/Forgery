First Draft

March 2000

JAKE (V.O.)

So I'm dead...

JAKE (V.O.)

And I think it's because of this

redhead...

BUTCH (O.S.)

Know who I am, Jake?

JAKE

The Anti-Christ?

BUTCH (O.S.)

No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the

Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy

looking for some answers.

BUTCH (cont' d)

Things are probably going to end badly

for you, Jake.

JAKE

Gee... What makes you say that?

BUTCH

Your life flashing before your eyes?

JAKE

Just the last three weeks.

(CONTINUED)

2.

BUTCH

That's not a bad place to start.

CUT TO:

JAKE

I lost my head. I'm... Sorry.    I don't

know what happened.

LIONEL

Y-y-you fucking shot him!   That's what

happened!

JAKE

I had to! That motherfucker was about

to welch! You saw what he was doing,

right? You heard him!

LIONEL

I can't be here! You understand?     I

can' t--

JAKE

Listen to me! It went to shit.     It

happens sometimes.

LIONEL

Oh Jesus!

JAKE

LISTEN to me! We don't have much time.

We can still get through this but you

have to keep your head and trust me!

(CONTINUED)

3.

LIONEL

What-- What do we do?

JAKE

Help me.

CUT TO:

JAKE

Come on.    Grab his arms.

JAKE

Lionel... He's dead. Yeah, maybe you

didn't pull the trigger, but you were

standing right there and watched me do

it. Help me. Grab his arms.

MILES

Tick-tock...

JAKE

If you wanna help, then help.    If not,

shut up.

MILES

Your mess.

JAKE

Then shut up.

MILES

My place.

(CONTINUED)

4.

MILES

Oh please...

MILES (cont' d)

You think this kinda shit hasn't happened

here before? Given it's usually on

Thursdays. And usually, I gotta tell

the cops, "No, Officer... I didn't really

get a good look at the shooters."

Usually anyway.

PATRON

(without looking up)

I didn't see nothing. And I swear if

you let me go now, I won't say-

JAKE

Relax, porkchop.

LIONEL

I can't be here!

JAKE

Then go.

LIONEL

What about... The money?

JAKE

What about this situation makes you

think I can answer that question right

now?

CUT T0:

5.

OFFICER (O.S.)

Everybody FREEZE!

CUT TO:

SOBOZINSKI

(yelling)

I said, freeze you motherfucking,

cocksucking, scumbags!

ROTTOVICH

We're clear.

SOBOZINSKI

(still yelling)

Or I'll blow off every one of your

fucking heads!

JAKE

Stop waving that thing around.

MILES

You sure we're clear?

(CONTINUED)

6.

ROTTOVICH

Guy looked like he was trying not to

shit himself.

(re: the Dead Guy)

Nice.

DEAD GUY

What took so fucking long?

DEAD GUY/GORDO

I've been lying in this shit like half

the night.

MILES

You guys were late.   We had to go to a

Mexican stand-off.

JAKE

And you know I hate guns.

SOBOZINSKI

We were fighting crime.

MILES

Keeping the city streets safe for drug

dealers and pedophiles everywhere.

GORDO

Shit.

JAKE

I told you, use less powder.

GORDO

But you won't get that splatter effect.

(CONTINUED)

7.

JAKE

Then these go into your cut.

BIG AL

Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to

play the Inside?

JAKE

Gordo plays the inside.   You're the

Shill.

BIG AL

Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is

cry and get insulted.

JAKE

What are you talking about? You should

get a fucking Academy Award for the

Shill work you do.

(off Al's smile)

We got it down cold, Al. You don't

want to jinx it by changing something

up, do you?

BIG AL

I' m gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want

eggrolls?

JAKE

What?   I can feel you looking at me.

GORDO

That's a lot of cash. He came up with

it pretty quick.

JAKE

Probably some investment banker or

convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did

you see how fast he ran out of here?

It's done. He's not coming back.

GORDO

I guess. I gotta drop a dime.    Did

anybody mess up the hoop?

MILES

It's clean.

(CONTINUED)

8.

JAKE

Ten percent.

SOBOZINSKI

You guys got sack, I'll give you that

much.

JAKE

Confidence.     It's just confidence.

ROTTOVICH

(patting his pocket)

Feels a little light, Jake.    Next time

we're in for twenty.

MILES

Twenty?   My ass!

JAKE

What are you talking about?    Ten's

standard.

ROTTOVICH

Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.

SOBOZINSKI

Do you have any idea what those monks

charge for that medieval torture?

JAKE

We got a good thing going here. You

want to blow it over an overbite?

ROTTOVICH

Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you

boys. You guys are the steadiest

business in town. But what can I say?

Twenty percent's still better than

what we give to any of the other

criminals.

JAKE

All the shit we pulled with you and

you're trying to shake us down? You

guys got sack.

ROTTOVICH

Was that a threat? Did I hear a

threat?

(CONTINUED)

9.

ROTTOVICH (cont' d)

Last I remember, we were talking

economics, then this..? What happens

next time if we gotta stop and help a

little old lady cross the street? Well,

shit... Then we gotta pass the call to

someone else.

MILES

(shaking his head)

Cops...

CUT TO:

BUTCH

Grifters...

JAKE

We can't all be model citizens such as

yourself.

BUTCH

It's all about the money, isn't it?

JAKE

Isn't it always?

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

It's what makes us run. And despite

what they say, it can buy you love.

CALL GIRL

Are you ready for me, Ralph?

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

10.

JAKE (V.O.)

It can buy you a new and better you.

GORDO

I just don't know if this says, "me".

What's the fabric?

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

It can erase all those things about you

that you wish didn't exist.

BIG AL

It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I

haven't been ducking you. I told you

I'd get it.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

It can make you think you're on top of

the world.

LILY

(innocently)

Oops.

(CONTINUED)

11.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

And if you believe that money can do

all that for you, you're the perfect

mark. Jack Kerouac said that if you

own a rug, you own too much. I don't

necessarily like Kerouac and driving

cross country isn't exactly my idea of

a good time, but the guy's got a

point...

CUT TO:

ANSWERING MACHINE

You have no new messages.

JAKE (V.O.)

If you've got nothing, you've got

nothing to lose. And when it comes to

money, finding it and losing it, you

always gotta remember how much of it's

just luck...

LILY (V. O. )

Oops.

(CONTINUED)

12.

JAKE

Dumb fucking luck.

CUT T0:

LUPUS

Mr. Dolby.    King would like a word with

you.

LIONEL

R-r-right now?

LUPUS

Please. We have a car waiting.     I

apologize for the door.

CUT T0:

JAKE

Yeah.

MILES (O.S.)

You better get over to Al's.    Now.

(CONTINUED)

13.

CUT TO:

MILES

I was supposed to meet him for breakfast.

He likes that new IHOP they just opened,

you know... He likes to order that thing.

The Rutti-Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing

they got.

JAKE

Miles...

MILES

Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did

to him. Right in the middle of his egg-

foo-young.

JAKE (V.O.)

Big Al used to send money to his Father,

some Vietnam Vet slowly losing his mind

in a VA hospital in Cleveland. Al was

like that. That's why Al never played

the Inside.

CUT TO:

GORDO

Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a

sudden case of drowning last night.

JAKE

Well, this is just fucking great...

(CONTINUED)

14.

GORDO

It gets worse. Now I know     why he was

such a good rope. X mean,     cash....

That much and we never had    to put him

on the "Send?" Turns out     this ducking

Moe was an accountant for    the King Pin.

MILES

Who's that?

GORDO

The cash we fleeced off of him was

collection money. He was supposed to

take that money and give it to the

King earlier yesterday like he does

every Thursday. `Cept this time, he

figured he could make a little

something for himself off us and still

get the King's money back before any

body says "boo."

MILES

What's a King Pin?

GORDO

Currently, the King Pin is a very large-

type pole stuck up our asses.

MTLES

Mob?

GORDO

Independant. Same shit, just

independant. They call him the King

Pin because he looks like that guy from

the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.

MILES

So what?   We hide, right?

GORDO

(shaking his head)

What are you? New? Let me tell you

how good this guy is. Last night, Al

calls this bookie to settle up.

Apparently he's been ducking him for

like a month. So the guy asks him where

he's got all this money all of a sudden,

right? What does Al do?

(CONTINUED)

15.

GORDO (cont'd)

Does he tell him that he cashed in a

fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell

him he's been giving head out back for

twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts

going on about this job he just pulled

and how he fleeced some Wall Street

asshole -type... How HE fleeced.

MILES

You're pissed we didn't get credit?

GORDO

No, that was the only semi-fucking smart

thing he said! Except anybody that's

ever met Big A1 knows that the only

thing he's comfortable doing alone is

eating. This guys tells this guy, that

guy tells some other guy, eventually it

works it's way back to someone who works

for the King and--

GORDO (V.O.)

Shazaam.

GORDO (coat' d)

Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young.

The whole thing took about two and a

half hours. That's how good he is.

MILES

We sure Big Al threw him to us?

GORDO

Come on...

JAKE

A bird flew into my house last night.

(CONTINUED)

16.

JAKE (cont'd)

It's bad luck.

MILES

Just an idea, but let's just fucking

split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron

or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...

JAKE

He'll find us. We go talk to him.

GORDO

Whoa.   What?

MILES

We're going to give him the money back?

JAKE

You know what we're doing with the money.

GORDO

And what about Big Al?

JAKE

Leave him. Someone's going to find him

eventually. Then they'll start looking

for us, too.

WAITRESS

What can I get you guys?

MILES

Coffee.   And a valium.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

The Euclid was our place.

CUT TO:

17.

JAKE (V.O.)

Gordo fleeced the deed off some idiot

in a card game. We used it every now

and then for a rag, but mostly it was

our office. Our Power Point.

JAKE

That's it?

MILES/GORDO

Bills.../Had that thing...

MILES (cont'd)

Do we want insurance?

(off their looks)

I'm just asking...

JAKE

Just mail it to the hospital.

(dialing)

Mr. King, please. It's regarding an

accounting problem. Yes... Correct...

I know where it is. That will be fine.

Thank you.

GORDO

When?

JAKE

Tonight.   Just me.

MILES

Fuck that.    We're going too.

GORDO

Alright, let's all put our dicks back

in our pants for a second. Is this the

best thing to do?

(CONTINUED)

18.

JAKE

Meet me at my place later.

MILES

How do you know the King's going to let

you walk?

JAKE

I'm getting a ride.

CUT TO:

SOBOZINSKI

The King, huh? Nice going.

JAKE

I try.

ROTTOVICH

Don't dick around too long. And if he

stabs you or shoots you or causes any

other form of profuse bleeding, call a

cab because you are not getting back in

this car!

HARLIN

We appreciate your punctuality.   Mr.

King is expecting you.

HARLIN

Lupus!

LUPUS

What? You said pat him down, I'm pattin'

him down.

(CONTINUED)

19.

HARLIN

It only takes a moment to be polite.

My apologies, Mr. Vig. If you wouldn't

mind?

JAKE

You the one that did it?   You the one

that got Al?

HARLIN

Mr. King prefers to farm out for that

kind of work.

(gesturing to the

door)

Please, after you.

CUT TO:

JAKE

(a little nervous)

Uh... Which one's the King Pin?

HARLIN

He's in the back taking a steam.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

20.

KING PIN

Ow!   Watch the pinkie!

KING PIN (cont'd)

Every time, you get the pinkie and I

get a hang nail.

( to Jake)

You Jake?

KING PIN

Grifter huh? Where have you been on

the grift? Couldn't been here long

'cause I would have heard of you,

Skippy.

JAKE

Jake. You can call me Jake.   Here and

there.

KING PIN

Here and there, Scooter? Here and

there like Boston, Chicago, Houston?

The bay area? Some action in London,

`til it turned nickel and dime. Or how

about that little stint down in Miami?

Heard you actually got into some

trouble with the Feds down there. You

guy's pretty good?

JAKE

I have a good crew.

KING PIN

Minus one.

JAKE

Minus one.

KING PIN

You know, back in the day, grafting was

considered a gentleman's racket. Good

suits, good food... The Underworld of

the Underworld. A grifter had to survive

on his wits, his instincts... I like

that. I like the idea of that.

These days, things being what they are,

guys like me gotta stay low.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

21.

KING PIN (cont' d)

It's all take, take, take . You can' t

just be fucking witty about it.

JAKE

I guess it lacks a certain style.

KING PIN

Of course, your line of work's only as

good as the people you find.

JAKE

You can't cheat an honest man.

KING PIN

You can't cheat an honest man.    But a

man like Lionel Dolby...

JAKE

I apologize for the inconvenience.

KING PIN

Honest mistake. Just give me the money

back and all will be forgiven.

JAKE

I can't do that.

KING PIN

Why not?

JAKE

Let me rephrase-- I won`t do that.

KING PIN

Let me repeat-- Why not?

JAKE

Because you killed one of my crew.

KING PIN

Buddy, that was business. Besides, you

have more crew. Then there's you...

JAKE

I'll get the money back, plus interest.

I go on the grift for you. You get a

cat, I get a cut. And we get square.

KING PIN

(laughing)

Fucking grifters! I love it! You got

balls, I'll give you that much.

(CONTINUED)

22.

JAKE

No.   Just confidence.

KING PIN

I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A

grifter comes in here with a fifteen

hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit,

cooler than an Eskimo in winter and

tells me he wants to grift for me?

First thing I have to ask myself is,

is he playing for me or is he just

plain playing me? You tried it once.

JAKE

We got caught. So you know it won't

happen again.

KING PIN

I know it won't happen because you're

going to feel like a Prom Queen who

just got gang fucked by the wrestling

team!

HARLIN

Mr. Vig arrived with an escort.   NYPD.

KING PIN

Grifters... Always working  an angle.

Alright. I can see you got   some vision.

But I give you the Mark. I   tell you

the who and you give me the  how. Lupus

go with him.

LUPUS

What?

KING PIN

Consider him part of your crew.

Consider him a part of me.

KING PIN

He goes.   Now let me see your hands.

(CONTINUED)

23.

JAKE

Why?

KING PIN

You ask a lot of questions.   Come on.

(motioning with nail

file)

Let me see `em.

KING PIN (cont' d)

I don't like to ask things more than

once, Junior. I want you to know how

much that irks me.

KING PIN

You have incredibly soft hands. Good

cuticles . They' re like a baby's hands.

Grifters with rough hands... You know

that they're probably not that good.

Means they've had to do some hard

labor to make ends meet. But you...

Smooth... Supple.

BUTCH (V.O.)

Are you insinuating that the King Pin

is of an alternative lifestyle?

CUT TO:

JAKE

I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're

one to talk. You're the one who's got

me on my knees in a dark alley.

(CONTINUED)

24.

BUTCH

And these cops? What do they get?

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Just a tip.

SOBOZINSKI

What are we gonna do with this stuff

anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you

do with heroin?

ROTTOVICH

You sell it.

SOBOZINSKI

To who?

ROTTOVICH

Don't be an idiot. How hard do you

think it is to sell one drug dealer's

drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's

right, we might be looking at a hundred,

maybe a hundred fifty grand...

SOBOZINSKI

You think this is a good idea?    We never

did this kinda shit before.

ROTTOVICH

What's he going to do? File a missing

drugs report? If it works out, this

guy might be good for a few more turns.

SOBOZINSKI

Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist

bills are killing me. One fifty every

time they tighten those bitches up.

One fifty! It's not even covered.

ROTTOVICH

It's cosmetic. They don't cover

cosmetic.

(CONTINUED)

25.

ROTTOVICH (cont' d)

Last year I had a tooth capped. The

dentist tells me I'm not covered for

caps. It's cosmetic.

CUT TO:

ROTTOVICH

(O.S. from headphones)

Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking

tooth was cracked in half. I made the

son of a bitch write it in as a

cavity. The department's dental is for

shit.

SOBOZINSKI

(O.S. from headphones)

Whoa, whoa... There he is.

MOONAN

Confessions of a poor brusher.

CUT TO:

SOBOZINSKI

You know who we are?

KID

The heat.

(CONTINUED)

26.

ROTTOVICH

That's right. We're the heat.

(yelling)

STICK `EM UP!

ROTTOVICH

Alright. Put your hands dawn.

What do you got in the bag?

KID

Something for my Pops.

ROTTOVICH

I see. Well, your Pops has been making

you carry around drugs for him. We're

going to have to take them.

KID

My Pops is going to be mad.

ROTTOVICH

Give the kid a twenty.

SOBOZINSKI

What's the world coming to?

Everybody's on the friggin' take...

CUT TO:

BUTCH

Keeping the Fix happy.

(CONTINUED)

27.

JAKE

You never know when you can use a crooked

cop.

BUTCH

Keep going. I want to know how you got

Lionel Dolby.

JAKE

So you want to know how to play the Big

Con.

BUTCH

In this case, you might say I want to

know how not to play the Big Con.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

First thing about being on the grift....

You're only as good as your Mark. The

Roper's the guy who finds them.

JAKE (V.O.)

They all have money one way or

another. Some of them come from money.

JAKE (V.O.)

There's that saying-- Show me an honest

man and I'll show you a natural born

liar. There's always that little bit

of bad no matter how much good. It's

that little itch on the back of you

neck. You may not even know it's there,

but it is.

(CONTINUED)

28.

JAKE (V.O.)

A good Roper knows how to scratch it--

You the outdoorsy-type? "I was just

fly fishing out in Montana". You play

the market? "I just got a tip on a

tech start-up IPO." You saw "the

'Riverdance" twice? "I had a roommate

in college who was gay." Whatever...

JAKE (V.O.)

It means that in fifteen minutes we're

on good terms. Thirty, I'm your buddy.

JAKE (V.O.)

In an hour, I'm your best friend.

JAKE (V.O.)

Give me a day and you'll let me do

your wife and daughter at the same time.

It's too late for you...

JAKE (V.O.)

I have your confidence.

MORPHS INTO:

JAKE (V.O.)

I tell you the "Tale"-- It's the story

of how we're going to make easy money.

No one gets hurt. And here's the guy

who's going to help. That's when you

meet the Insideman.

(CONTINUED)

29.

JAKE (V.O.)

The Insideman's the one with the know-

How, the scoop, the angle. But maybe

'you' re the suspicious type . So I

give you the "Convincer." We both put

up a little and we get a little back.

Just a taste.

JAKE (V.O.)

Just enough that when I tell you we can

make more off of it, you agree.

JAKE (V.O. )

That`s when I put you on the "Send."

You put in -a little, you got a little.

Put in a lot... I "send" you out for

mare.  As much as you can get.

CUT TO:

JAKE

Doesn't matter what the con is.

Insider trading, a line we got on   a

bookie club, insurance scam,

whatever... You saw the money and you

want it. More of it. Who cares   if you

have to bend the rules a little?  As

long as no one gets hurt.

JAKE (cont'd)

Then someone does...

CUT TO:

30.

JAKE

(turns 'to face CAMERA)

Frankie Suits always said, that what

you have to understand about any

confidence game, is that it's like

putting on a play where everyone knows

their part... The Roper, the

Insideman, the Shills... Everyone

except for the Mark.

GORDO

(while playing dead)

I've been shot. Oh. The humanity.

BIG AL

(monotone)

God. No. Please.     Don't kill me.

MILES

(indifferent)

You better hurry. The police will be

here any second.

(breaking character)

I don't really understand my

motivation with this. Why am I washing

glasses?

JAKE

(still facing camera)

Now you're an accomplice in a

homicide. Everything you thought you

were in control of just flew out the

window or is dripping down your leg.

JAKE

(turning to Dolby)

You should be running out the door,

desperate to forget this ever

happened, ready to repent your greedy

ways!

(CONTINUED)

31.

DOLBY

What about... The money?

JAKE

(turns back to CAMERA)

Then there it is again... That little

itch. There's a guy holding a smoking

gun, a guy bleeding all over the floor

and still, all you can think about is

the money. You twisted fuck. So we

gotta give you the "Blow-off". We make

sure that you never, ever want to look

for us again. We get you off our backs.

Forever.

JAKE

And that's why you need the "Fix"...

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

The New York Police Department's finest.

Half as smart and twice as crooked as

the guy they just chased away.

CUT TO:

BUTCH

So how'd you get caught?

(CONTINUED)

32.

JAKE

Suits used to say that in any con,

sooner or later someone's going to

start asking the right questions.

Usually, it takes a little longer.

CUT TO:

JAKE

We're working for the King.

MILES

(re: Lupus)

Wait a second... Who's the mope?

LUPUS

I'm the King's eyes and ears.   Just in

case you decide to get cute.

MILES

So we gotta short con our way out of a

hundred and fifty grand? That could

only take like, a year.

JAKE

No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we

get out from under all this. But we

need another Shill.

MILES

What do we need another Shill for?

JAKE

Breasts.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

33.

JAKE

(not so innocently)

Oops.

CUT TO:

LILY

What is this? You guys cops or

something?

JAKE

We're not cops.

GORDO

You gotta be kidding me.       Her?

JAKE

Yes, her.    Where's my wallet?

LILY

Your what?

LILY (cont'd)

That's not--

JAKE

(pocketing the wallet)

You interested in a little work?

LILY

Sorry about your wallet, but if you

think I'm going to suck dick over thirty

seven dollars, a waxed out Visa and a

bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.

(lighting the cigarette)

Jake.

34.

JAKE

Take a deep breath and count to ten.

It's not that kind of work. You're

Lily, right?

LILY

Says who?

JAKE

You're working Daffy's block. He was

going to break your kneecaps. Pick-

pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I

told him you were with us, so that's

two you owe me.

JAKE

We have work. It pays a lot. Unless

you figure on getting rich lifting

wallets while old guys feel you up.

LILY

Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who

feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda

gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha

going?

LILY (cont' d)

Keep the wallet. We're even. Take a

deep breath... Count to ten... And go

fuck yourself.

MILES

Is it just me or is there something

really hot about a girl telling you to

go fuck yourself?

CUT TO:

35.

JAKE

Alright!   Hold up.    You win.   You got

the job.

LILY

Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find

that bridge to jump off.

JAKE

We had to see what your deal was.      I'm

just a little superstitious.

LILY

Here's my deal-- Don't waste my time.

What do you want me for anyway? You

don't even know me.

JAKE

I just have a good feeling about you.

Haven't you ever had someone say they

had a good feeling about you before?

LILY

No.

(beat)

What's my cut?

JAKE

You get an equal cut.

LILY

What do I have to do?

JAKE

Just play a part.     A little acting.

LILY

Make a wish.

LILY

Eleven-eleven. If you're superstitious,

make a wish.

(CONTINUED)

36.

LILY (cont'd)

That's twice.

CUT TO:

BUTCH

I can see why you liked her.

JAKE

That was it. We had our crew.    Now we

needed the Mark.

CUT TO:

JAKE

Morgan Gillette.

MILES

Why?

JAKE

Because that's who the King Fin wants

us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

His grandfather used to run liquor

during prohibition and his father made

a bundle in illegal importing and

exporting. That makes him a third

generation crook.

(CONTINUED)

37.

JAKE (cont' d)

He's been tied into pretty much

everything; drugs, mob, money

rinsing...

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

There's a story going around that he

helped fund the Contras back in the

eighties.

CUT TO:

JAKE

Most of his money's clean. A lot of it

isn't. The best part is that we know

exactly where it is.

CUT TO:

GORDO

How much we going after?

JAKE

Two million.

(CONTINUED)

38.

GORDO

We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.

JAKE

We get fifty percent.   And we get clear

of the King.

LUPUS

That's worth it right there. You ask

me, I don't think you can do it.

MILES

I'm with Jack LaLane.   That guy's

untouchable.

JAKE

That's why we don't go after him

directly.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

We find a doable guy in Gillette's

bank... Someone about mid-level. Not

too high, not too low.

JAKE (V.O.)

We meet him with corporate papers,

inquiring about a corporate loan for

start up capital. The corporate papers

are in order, but we need things to

happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in

the right places, moves our papers to

the top of the pile or to the bottom,

depending upon what we need.

GORDO (V.O.)

How's that?    He works for Gillette.

JAKE (V.O.)

We pay better.

(CONTINUED)

39.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Our guy gets us approved for the start

up capital. But, the money can't be

transferred to any one person. On the

given day, the money's wired into a

corporate account in an off-shore

bank.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

That same day, I show up in the Caymens

with the proper I.D. and corporate papers

to make a withdrawal.

MILE5 (V.O.)

Uh...

JAKE (V.O.)

What?

MILE5 (V.O.)

I'm just thinking out loud here, but...

Two million in a briefcase?

JAKE (V.O.)

Good point.

JAKE (V.O.)

It's bank policy not to release this

money in cash because it's under a

corporate account.

(CONTINUED)

40.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

So we cash the check at another bank.

Jake slides the suitcase and the check

over to the Teller.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Now, this is the most important part--

You can't just walk into the United

States with a suitcase full of cash

without evoking the words "cavity

search".

JAKE (V.O.)

That's why you need someone on the inside

at Customs.

(CONTINUED)

41.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Then we disappear.

CUT TO:

MILES

(breaking the silence)

This might just be me, but that is hands

down, the dumbest fucking idea I've

ever heard.

GORDO

People have tried this before, Jake.

It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and

his crew went on vacation in Chicago

for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched

in L.A.

JAKE

It never worked before because A, they

didn't flush the bank enough; B, their

corporate papers were for shit; C,

they didn't have someone on the inside

with Customs.

MILES

Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking

idea...

JAKE

Then what do you want to do, Miles?

Run?

(CONTINUED)

42.

MILES

We never had a problem with that before.

JAKE

Yeah, well we never had this kind of

problem before.

MILES

What are you talking about? Yes we

have. And we would have been beautiful

about it. We would've had a bucket of

chicken delivered to the King with a

nice kiss my ass card attached to it.

Then we woulda moved on `til the next

local putz caught on.

JAKE

We're getting a little old for

running.

MILES

Yeah, well we're still a little young

for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed

about Al? I'm pissed too, but I' m not

like "twenty-five to life" pissed.

JAKE

I'm getting clear of this. If you're

not going to do it for the fucking

principle, do it for the money. Gordo?

GORDO

Yeah... Whatever, Jake.

JAKE

No, not "whatever." You're either in or

you' re out.

LILY

I'm in.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

I agreed with Miles. It was, hands down,

a dumb fucking idea.

(CONTINUED)

43.

JAKE (V.O.)

But they bought it. Now I had to deliver

and I needed help.

JAKE (into phone)

Yeah, it's Jake. How'd that tip work

out?

CUT TO:

BUTCH

But there were other factors.

JAKE

Factors that weren't clear to me until

now.

CUT TO:

MOONAN

Gentlemen?   Special Agent Gunther Moonan.

ROTTOVICH

Special Agent?

MOONAN

You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And

this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski.

I'm looking for Jake Vig.

SOBOZINSKI

Who?

MOONAN

I've been looking for this Jake Vig for

some time now. Problem is, the guy's

the invisible man. A spook, a spectre,

a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's

good buddy and member of his crew,

Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day

with a hole in his head.

(CONTINUED)

44.

MOONAN (cont'd)

Preliminary forensics suggests he was.

Sitting there, bloated and purple in

his egg foo young for at least seventy

two hours. Alfonse was not a small man

and there was a lot of food ordered, so

you can imagine the smell. Bad for the

neighbors, good for me because in all

the time I've been looking for Jake,

this is only the second time I've even

gotten a whiff of him.

ROTTOVICH

Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't

know what you're talking about.

ROTTOVICH

(V.O. from tape)

Don't be an idiot. How hard do you

think it is to sell one drug dealer's

drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's

right, we might be looking at a

hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand.

MOONAN

Oh yeah, I almost forgot. The two

serious looking gentlemen outside?

Internal Affairs.

MOONAN

Do you want to know the first time I

had a line on Vig? He sent me a

birthday card.

(off their silence)

Belated, but it's the thought, right?

Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor.

But, then again you guys probably know

him better than I do. In fact, I've

only met the guy once. But now, now I

have you. The next best thing. His

partners. His "Fix."

SOBOZINSKI

What do you want?

(CONTINUED)

45.

MOONAN

You help me catch him. Whatever he's

into next, I want you to be into. And

what you're into, I'm into. If it all

goes well, those two guys from IAD will

never have to hear this tape. I'll

clear you guys of anything you've ever

done with Vig under the guise of some

cross-departmental investigation. This

prick's been on the wish list for so

long, you'll probably get gold shields

out of it.

SOBOZINSKI

What do you get out of it?

MOONAN

Peace of mind.

SOBOZINSKI

That's it?

MOONAN

Not everyone's on the take, Walter.

ROTTOVICH

If you Feds are so hot for him, why

don't we just bring him in right now?

MOONAN

I want him for something big and to do

that, we have to catch him in the act.

SOBOZINSKI

This guy must have been a real pain in

your dick.

MOONAN

Literally. It's not a bad deal,

gentleman. I get peace of mind. You

get Detective Sheilds. But this is the

best part, Walter... Walter, your

daughter will get to keep her braces

and have that winning smile. Capice?

MOONAN

Good. One more thing... You gotta give

up the booty. I can't have you guys

running around with heroin.

(CONTINUED)

46.

JAKE (V.O.)

Let me tell you something about Moonan...

CUT TO:

JAKE

He's just as crooked as the next guy.

You'd think he'd have more important

things to do with tax payer dollars.

BUTCH

Cue the fucking violins.   Come on...

It's getting cold.

CUT TO:

MILES

Am I the only one who feels like we

can't make a move with this guy on us?

LILY

We should ditch him.

JAKE

Just watch every thing you say around

him. Every word, every move... It all

goes back to the King Pin.

GORDO

How's the hoop, superstar?   Clean?

LUPUS

What is it with you and bathrooms?

MILES

He doesn't like using a bathroom unless

he knows it's clean.

LILY

Manly.

(CONTINUED)

47.

GORDO

You laugh now, but wait until you need

a clean place to powder. This is New

York city, Sister. Public sanitation

does not run very high on the city hall

agenda. You know what you can get off

a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the

list... Hepatitis, influenza, the

flesh eating disease-

JAKE

Here's what's going to happen. Gordo,

we need to find a guy in Gillette's

bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate,

insurance...

MILES

Is it all fugasi?

JAKE

No, the corporate papers have to be

legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A

clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get

us a Banker.

LILY

What about Customs?

JAKE

I'll worry about Customs.

LILY

Hey, I' m not just along for the ride,

so I don't want to hear any bullshit

later about a smaller cut.

JAKE

Take a deep breath. You sound like you

just broke up with your boyfriend or

something.

CUT TO:

KING PIN

How much?

(CONTINUED)

48.

JAKE

I think two million.

KING PIN

What do you need from me? Permission?

Go! If you can fleece him for two

million, then do it, Kid.

JAKE

I need you to stake me.

KING PIN

Stake you?

JAKE

I need you to stake me. I can't do it

without it. It's just a couple hundred

grand. Taken out of our cut when we're

done.

KING PIN

That's more than you already owe me.

What happens if you fuck this up?

JAKE

Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

KING PIN

Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump"

tattooed on my forehead?

LILY

Mr . King, I think---

JAKE

(w/ a look)

Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes.

You just might learn something here.

KING PIN

Listen, Scooter---

JAKE

No, you listen. We're partners now and

even though I'm running the show for

you, I'm still running the show. That

means I get a little respect. So I

don't want to hear anymore of this

Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger,

bullshit. It's Jake.

(beat)

(CONTINUED)

49.

JAKE

And I gotta tell you, for a guy who

spends all his time in a gym, you

could be in better shape.

KING PIN

Take off your shirt.

JAKE

Excuse me?

KING PIN

I said take off your fucking shirt.

JAKE

Fine. You want me to take it off, I'll

take it off.

KING PIN

Look at you, you skinny prick.

JAKE

You're not going to bust out baby oil

and start rubbing me down or anything,

are you?

KING PIN

Come here.   Feel this.

JAKE

No thanks.   I'm good.

KING PIN

Come here!

(CONTINUED)

50.

LILY

You guys are freaking me out.

KING PIN

Shut up. Feel that? That's solid

muscle. Not an ounce of fat. Go ahead.

Punch it.

JAKE

I am not going--

KING PIN

Come on.    Harder.

JAKE

I think I just broke my hand.

KING PIN

Harder.    Remember, I killed your buddy.

KING PIN (cont'd)

All muscle.

KING PIN

Maybe it's true. Maybe you can't cheat

an honest man. Me? I'm about as

dishonest as they come and that's the

truth. But if you even think about

trying to con me they'll find fucking

pieces of you in each of the five

boroughs. Pieces of you, pieces of

her, pieces of your whole crew. Can't

be any mare honest than that. I'll

stake you, but that's three hundred

fifty you're in the hole and consider

the juice running. Now go make me proud.

(CONTINUED)

51.

JAKE

You get all that?

CUT TO:

BUTCH

Nice.

JAKE

We got our stake. Now we need to find

our guy in Gillett's bank.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

What you're looking for in a mark is

someone who's weakness you can exploit.

MILES

Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.

JAKE (V.O.)

Guy like me, with people like that...

I'll tell you what you're looking for

without even meeting you. It's like a

personal ad you wear over your head.

JAKE

No.

CUT TO:

52.

MILES

Jay Houlser.     VP International finance.

CUT TO:

JAKE

No.

CUT TO:

MILES

Alice Tanner. Finance Director.

JAKE

No.

CUT TO:

53.

MILES

Grant Ashby.     VP of Corporate Loans.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

What you're looking for in a      mark is

someone who's got nothing to      lose. No

friends, no family, no life.       You're

looking for a guy who doesn't      own a

rug.

JAKE

Him.

MILES

You sure?

JAKE

I' m sure.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

54.

JAKE

Now we had the con and the mark.    We

needed to look the part...

JAKE (V.O.)

Frankie Suits was a legend in certain

circles. He. Was on the grift since

he was ten.

FRANKIE

Last of the red hot grifters.

JAKE (V.O.)

Back in the day, Suits made money

running fight stores and the wire with

a Fix so tight it was like a legit

business. I never understood what the

point was if grifting became like a

regular job.

JAKE

We need wardrobe.

FRANKIE (re: Lupus)

So I see. In from Long Island?     You

fellas take a look around.

GORDO

Hey Suits? You got anything in like a

eleven or twelve ounce Super 100 worsted?

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

55.

SUITS

Corporate papers with the New York State

seal, insurance documents with a proof

of bonding and some fugasi financial

records. There's also the I.D. you

asked for. Corporate papers with the

New York State seal, insurance documents

with a proof of bonding and some fugasi

financial records. There's also the

I.D. you asked for.

JAKE

Aces, Suits.

SUITS

Not easy   pickin's. Papers like these

speak to   larger issues. Sorry about

Alfonse.

(off   Jake's nod)

You into   something big?

JAKE

Pretty much.

SUITS

In over your head?

JAKE

Pretty much.     Suits eyes Lily.

SUITS

Can I speak to you in confidence?

JAKE

Huh?   Oh.   She's alright.

SUITS

Try and keep up... You ask for      the

Advantage Goods, then you guys      come in

looking to be Bean Traps. So I       gotta

think you're either working the      mace or

playing the Jug Mob.

JAKE

A little bit of both.

SUITS

Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so

I got no problem with the way you help

yourself, Jake.

(CONTINUED)

56.

SUITS (cont'd)

I saw you go up from the Knecker,

working that Grind, learning the

Barnard's Law and I thought, "the

kid's a prodigy.'" But I know that if

you're using these goods... So then I

figure, what's worth that? You're

either looking for a little history or

a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?

JAKE

Can't say.

SUITS

Then who's the Banker?

JAKE

The King.

SUITS

The King? Jake, you play the heavy

rackets like that... They put the lug

on for nothing at all.

JAKE

I can handle it.

SUITS

I don't doubt your talent. You looking

for that place in the hall of fame?

JAKE

It's not history.

SUITS

So what do you want?

JAKE

I want to get out from under all this

for good. And I want to fuck them all

doing it.

SUITS

Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you

can't get what you want.

JAKE

Yes I can.

(CONTINUED)

57.

SUITS

Still time.

JAKE

Can't do it Suits.      I can't lay down

for this one.

SUITS

Okay. Here's the thing... You fall

flat, you might not get anything short

of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land

for everybody. Papers like these are

dangerous because papers tend to

multiply, then they start to take

shape. Usually it's the shape of an

arrow. I hate to do it, but after this,

I gotta give you the blowoff.

We Jake, Jake?

JAKE

We're Jake.

CUT TO:

LILY

What the hell's his problem?

JAKE

Don't worry about it.

LILY

It's just that I left my asshole decoder

ring at home, so how do I know not to

worry?

JAKE

You need to get a haircut.

LILY

What?

JAKE

And some new clothes.

LILY

Why?

(CONTINUED)

58.

JAKE

We're going to rope this banker

tomorrow and you gotta at least look

classy, if not be classy. You gotta do

this thing and I don't even know if

you can.

LILY

You're just going to have to trust me.

JAKE

I don't trust anyone.

LILY

Then show me how.

CUT TO:

JAKE

(to himself)

Oh yeah. This is good. This will do

nicely.

(to Lily)

This is about confidence. Your

confidence and their confidence. You

get their confidence by giving them

yours.

once or twice.

MR. LEWIS

Of course.   Jake. Nice to see you.

JAKE

Well, it certainly is a coincidence.

Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?

MR. LEWIS

Great.   Thank you.

Excuse me? I believe you're holding

something far me under Pearson.

SALESGIRL

Do you have a ticket?

JAKE

You   know, this is kind of embarassing,

but   my wallet was stolen yesterday and

I'm   afraid the ticket was in it. But

the   name's Pearson.

MR. LEWIS

While you're back there, could you make

sure that Carolyn is spelled with a

"y"?

MR. LEWIS (cont'd)

What brings you down from Boston, Jake?

Taking advantage of the long weekend?

JAKE

My wife and I are just taking a little

vacation.

MR. LEWTS

Carolyn's down this weekend too.

Uh... Everything okay?

JAKE

Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn

Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my

earrings.

MR. LEWIS

Attractive girl.

61.

JAKE

Thank you.    Actually, it's our first

anniversary   this weekend. She thinks

I'm here to   pick up something for my

mother, but   it's actually a gift for

her. Think    I've fooled her?

MR. LEWIS

Take it from me, you never do. But

congratulations. Nice to be married,

isn't it?

JAKE

Very much so.

SALESGIRL

We have Carolyn with a "y". I'm sorry,

there's nothing under Pearson. If we

had an invoice number--

JAKE

I told you. My wallet was stolen.

Please... Check again.

MR. LEWIS

Good luck.    Congratulations again.

JAKE

Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this

isn't too much of an inconvenience, but

if Carolyn is coming down for the

weekend, perhaps I could give you

something for her? It's a check. We

split the cost on a few books and I

haven't had the chance to pay her back

yet. Could you..?

MR. LEWIS

Sure.

JAKE

That'd be a great help.

You're sure? This is... Just a

complete disaster.

one. In fact, it was that one.

SALESGIRL

That's no problem. We have those in

stock.

JAKE

Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little

anxious to give it to her. You take

out of state checks?

SALESGIRL

With identification.

JAKE

I understand that, but I had my wallet

stolen last night. Is there any way..?

SALESGIRL

I'm sorry.

JAKE

I know it's policy, but...

The thing is... It's our first

anniversary and we're only in town for

the weekend. It's a very, very special

night for my wife and I. This ring is

my gift to her and I think she's going

to really love it. I can give you

phone numbers to call for people

hello for me.

Why don't you let me put the ring on

the card and you can write me a check

in return?

It's Moonan... I'm in New York.

Listen, I got Vig. He's here and I'm

but I'm telling you this time...

Obsessive is a big word to use...

Goddamn it, Lou! I'm telling you, this

is it. Yeah... I figured you'd feel

that way. So here's the deal... Call

Kylie over at the Bureau. Tell him I

got something that might interest him.

A guy they call the King Pin. I think

there may be a corruption case brewing

here, too... That's right. So even if

I don't get Vig, you'll still have

something to show.

So, what do you have for me?

Whaddya mean? We got dick.

Look, I'm not a confrontational person

MOONAN

I need answers and the only two things

you've given me are jack and shit. You

gotta do better. You gotta do better

or I swear on my sweet dead

grandmother's grave, I'm gonna make

you guys an I-A-fucking-D cautionary

tale.

JAKE

Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't

light three cigarettes with a match?

(CONTINUED)

66.

JAKE (cont' d)

Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW' s,

if you took the time to light three

cigarettes with one match, some Nazi

would be able to figure out where you

were. Then, well... It was the last

cigarette you and your two buddies ever

had. So three on a match is bad luck.

BUTCH

You're a superstitious fucker.

JAKE

Luck's a funny thing.    Especially the

bad.

BUTCH

Like what?

JAKE

Having a gun pointed at you for one.

It's not like breaking a mirror bad

luck, but it's bad. Three on a match,

black cats... Believe it. Believe it

all.

JAKE (V.O.)

But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all

jinxes? A bird in your house...

CUT TO:

68.

JAKE (V.O.)

A bird enters your house...

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

It means death.

JAKE

You have no idea what you've done do

you? No idea! What is this?

LILY

You told me to change my hair!

JAKE

(re: the shirt)

What about this? Do you have any idea

what this means? You've killed us.

We're dead!

LILY

Did I miss something?

GORDO

The red hair... It's bad luck.

MILES

It's not like she's a real redhead,

Jake...

JAKE

Like that matters! You can't fool bad

luck! You can't get by on a

technicality! You can't trick karma!

(CONTINUED)

69.

LILY

So much for that good feeling, huh?

JAKE

Anybody says a word I swear to God...

CUT TO:

BUTCH

She had you tempting fate.

JAKE

My father used to play the same fucking

lotto numbers with these other guys in

the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday

for sixteen years. One day he gets

pissed off, tells them he's out and

plays his own numbers. They hit the

Lucky Seven for one point two million.

LILY

Guess he passed on that unlucky-

asshole gene.

LILY

You should have trusted me Jake.

CUT TO:

GORDO

She up for this?

(CONTINUED)

70.

JAKE

She's up for it.

BLONDE (O.S.)

Is this seat taken?

ASHBY

(brightening)

Uh, no. Please.

BLONDE

Thanks.

LILY (O.S.)

Sorry I'm late.

LILY

But I'm not that late.    You didn't have

to give away my seat.

ASHBY

(getting it)

I wasn't sure if you'd make it.

BLONDE

Oh, I didn't know you... Here.    Sorry.

LILY

No problem.

LILY

Thanks for playing along.    I just have

to sit for a while.

ASHBY

Tough day?

(CONTINUED)

71.

LILY

Brutal day. They say the streets are

lined with money down here, but I guess

you have to know the secret handshake.

What are you drinking?

ASHBY

Uh, Maker's Mark.      Rocks.

ASHBY

My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.

LILY

Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude.

Lily. Lily Finn.

ASHBY

So, what do you do?

LILY

It's more like what aren't I doing.        My

partners and I are trying to secure

start up capital for a small tech

company. We tried the venture

capitalist route in the Valley, but

then again who hasn't up there.

ASHBY

Silicon Valley?

LILY

That's right. So, brainiacs that we

are, we thought we'd be innovative and

relocate east. Try our luck with a

straight corporate loan out here.

ASHBY

I can---

LILY

On me.     For the seat.   Cheers.

LILY

So we've been meeting with banks all

day. It's amazing how many ways they

can say "no" without ever using the

word.

(CONTINUED)

72.

ASHBY

Well, typically, corporate loans are

relatively simple matters, but you do

need to demonstrate a capacity for gross

fund recovery.

LILY

Don't tell me you started a tech firm

here before us.

ASHBY

No, no.   Nothing like that.   I work in

a bank.

LILY

(leaning in)

Really? Wish we had met eight hours

ago.

LILY

(getting up)

My partners are here.

ASHBY

Oh.   Well, thanks for the drink.

LILY

You're welcome. I was just going to

ask you if you'd like to join us. Ashby

brightens again.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

She got one leg out from under him.

Now we had to lean.

73.

GORDO

So then Miles walks straight into the

Creative Director's office and says

"The code's fine, the program's for

shit" and throws down like a thousand

pages of code on the guy's desk!

JAKE

So this is our boss, right? He chases

me and Miles out of his office and

he's yelling and screaming, "You're

fired! Your whole team's fired!" He

starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo--

MILES

But the best part was that he couldn't

find Gordo! He was in the bathroom.

So he finally goes in there, kicks in a

stall door and starts yelling! And

there's Gordo, pants at the ankles,

holding a PC World Magazine!

GORDO

I haven't been able to use a public

bathroom since.

LUPUS

Especially with the thing!

JAKE

Uh, right... And that was it. That's

when we decided to start our own

business. No more shithead bosses.

ASHSY

I envy you guys. Taking a chance like

that.

GORDO

Masters of our own destiny.

LILY

So far, masters of our own demise.

What bank are you with?

ASHBY

City Bank of Manhattan.

(CONTINUED)

74.

GORDO

That's that Gillette guy, right?

(off Ashby's nod)

You Like him? As a boss, I mean.

ASHBY

He's . . . He's okay.

GORDO

(goading)

Come on...

ASHBY

No.

JAKE

What do you do over at your bank,

Grant?

ASHBY

What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.

MILES

Wow. We haven't met with anyone your

level yet. VP? So that means there's

you, then the P.

ASHBY

(Confidently Yeah.   That's right.

JAKE (V.O.)

Here's where a little research comes in

handy. Corporate banks give out VP

titles like calendars. It's a small

lie, but now we're sure he's playing.

JAKE

Maybe you can help us understand what's

so hard about getting a corporate loan.

ASHBY

Well, typically speaking, they're not.

As long as you can demonstrate--

(CONTINUED)

75.

JAKE

A capacity for gross fund recovery.

Yeah, we got that part.

ASHBY

That's right. And tech firms... They

'tend to scare people off.

JAKE

They scare people off because most

people lack vision. Vision and balls.

Present company excluded of course.

ASHBY

Banks need to know how they're going to

get their money back.

JAKE

We know exactly how we're going to make

The money back. There in lies the

Catch-22

ASHBY

I don't follow.

GORDO

Jake...

LILY

It's alright. Grant's one of the good

guys.

LUPUS

Yeah.   He's our boy.

JAKE

(leaning in)

Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm

telling you in confidence, okay?

(off Ashby's nod)

Have you ever heard of a company called

Big.Com?

ASHBY

Big.Com.   That Internet thing.

(CONTINUED)

76.

JAKE

Right. The guys who started that did

what a lot of companies in the Valley

do. They get a good idea, shop it

around, raise some capital, then sell

it off to a bigger company. Microsoft,

Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of

it is, they've pretty much sold the

company before they're even real. The

bigger company is already set to buy

it, all they want to do is make sure

that the idea actually works. So they

get some start up capital, make it work,

then sell it for like five times the

initial loan.

ASHY

Sort of like a letter of intent.

JAKE

Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you

can't tell anyone about the offer,

because if it's public, you could start

a bidding war and that's considered a

breach of etiquette. It could kill a

deal. But, wait too long and you're

not considered hot anymore.

ASHBY

And you have this letter of intent?

JAKE

(quietly)

Yes. That's why I wish there were guys

willing to take a chance and live a

little.

LILY

We're getting down to the wire.

Apparently another company has a

similar product in R&D right now.   If

they beat us to it...

JAKE

Off the record, I'm this close to

cutting someone in on the action if

it'd help.

ASHBY

Should we get another round?

CUT TO:

77.

GORDO

Poor bastard never knew what hit him.

Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.

MILES

I gotta work off some of this

adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn

Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody

want in?

LILY

I' m going home

GORDO

Let's go, Jake?

JAKE

Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the

way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar

pay-off.

GORDO

You sure?

JAKE

Lupus!

JAKE (cont'd)

When this is all over, you're going to

tell me who the King put on Al.

LUPUS

You going to have the time?

JAKE

I'11 find the time.

LILY

Look at you... You want to go.

JAKE

For what?   A couple hundred bucks?

(CONTINUED)

78.

LILY

I think you'd do it for free. You' re

almost drooling. You like the rush.

JAKE

It's what I do. It's my job.

LILY

Why? Your mother not breast feed you

or something?

JAKE

Are you asking me if I have something

to prove?

LILY

Do you have something to prove?

JAKE

Not in that repressed anger sort of

way.

LILY

I'm your basic underachiever. Can't

stand working and porn doesn't seem

like a good option.

JAKE

Good quality porn has it's place in the

world.

LILY

Whatever. But you... I get the feeling

you could have bullshitted your way

into anything. So why this?

JAKE

I'm good at it. Lying, cheating.

Manipulating... I'm good at it.

LILY

It's more than that.

JAKE

Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda.

Like tonight. You killed that guy

tonight. But I knew you would.

LILY

So that was my part?   Smile and shake

my ass?

JAKE

No. You have another part?     You'll

know what to do.

(CONTINUED)

79.

LILY

How do you know I will?

JAKE

Intuition.

CUT TO:

LILY

You have really soft hands.    Like a

baby's.

JAKE

(remembering the King)

Don't ruin this for me.

CUT TO:

BUTCH

Is that what it was, Jake?    Was it

love?

JAKE

You know when the first con was ever

played? It was when Adam fell for Eve

in the Garden of Eden.

JAKE

Then she fucked him over with an apple.

(with a dry laugh)

Redheads...

CUT TO:

80.

JAKE

(drowned out by the

rumble)

How do you deal with---

LILY

(yelling)

WHAT?

JAKE

(yelling back)

SAID, HOW DO--

(the subway passes)

Deal with that?

LILY

Do you think we can do it?

JAKE

Maybe. Even if we don't, you'll be

alright. You're not in the hole with

the King.

LILY

Who says you have to know the King to

be in a whole? I actually did have a

real job once. When I was in high

school, I worked as a candy striper.

JAKE

Sounds respectable.

LILY

Not the way I did it. I was loaded

half the time. I don't know how you

could change bedpans sober.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

81.

LILY (CONT'D)

I used to hang out with this guy,

Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or

something.

JAKE

You want to talk about an old

boyfriend right now?

LILY

He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a

boyfriend at the time... What was his

name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty.

I was only fifteen. But he was a nice

guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We

used to get loaded on pills from the

nurses station and then listen to

Morrisey or some stupid shit like

that.

JAKE

Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never

worked for me.

LILY

We were friends. I trusted him. I

should have known it was weird. But,

then again I was weird.

JAKE

You guys got busted.   This is a great

neck.

LILY

No, we never got busted. We were done

with a shift one night, both a couple

of Percocets down and I was telling

Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we

were thinking about doing it, you know?

I was thinking about letting him be my

first because I loved him.

(pause)

What the hell was his name?

JAKE

Glenn talked you out of it.

LILY

Sort of. I was telling him about this

great love of my life who's name I don't

remember, and I could see... He was

getting pissed. I thought it was just

because he was worried about me, but...

(CONTINUED)

82.

LILY (cont'd)

He told me that I was stupid because

my boyfriend didn't really love me.

JAKE

He was looking out for you.

LILY

Then he grabbed me and threw me down

on the floor, that really cold

linoleum tiled hospital floor and

started ripping my uniform off.

(pause)

He said he was going to "fuck some

sense into me."

LILY

Shit, what was that guy's name?   I really

liked him.

JAKE

Lily... Jesus Christ...

LILY

After Glenn was finished, he gave me a

couple of valiums and I went home. The

next day, I finished my shift and met

him around back, like we always did. I

stuck a number eight scalpel into his

chest. Three or four times.

JAKE

Did, uh... Did you kill him?

LILY

I don't know. I packed up my shit and

ran away. To this... So unlike you, I

guess I do have something to prove, in

a repressed anger sort of way.

JAKE

No. You trusted him... You were just

getting square.

LILY

You know why I told you that, Jake?

(turning towards him)

Because I trust you too.

(CONTINUED)

83.

CUT TO:

JAKE

Sorry, honey. But I figure if we can't

all share at a time like this...

BUTCH

You got some issues, huh?

LILY

(with a hiss)

I can take care of myself.

BUTCH

Hurry up.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

We had to finalize the deal.

ASHBY

Everything looks in order.

JAKE

This has to happen fast.

ASHBY

I know.   It won't go unnoticed.

JAKE

There'll be red flags.

(CONTINUED)

84.

ASHBY

What's this?

JAKE

You need some convincing.       Consider it

a convincer.

ASHBY

Let's just slow down for a second...

JAKE

You're worried about recouping the loan.

I already told you.

ASHBY

No, I understand that. What I mean...

What I'm trying to say... I was

actually wondering about...

Well, my cut.

JAKE (V.O.)

Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.

JAKE

The standard ten.

ASHBY

Ten percent.     Of how much?

JAKE

Two million.

GORDO

We're going to make it back, Grant.

JAKE

And all you need to do for your ten

percent is put some paperwork through

and push a button tomorrow.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

85.

GORDO

You'll be there?

JAKE

Eight A.M. flight.

GORDO

Calls?

JAKE

We'll use the Euc.

CUT TO:

ROTTOVICH

Hey Jake.

JAKE

That tip not work-out for you fellas?

ROTTOVICH

Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little

more curious about the Fed.

JAKE

Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay

your taxes, that's your business.

SOBOZINSKI

(pulling his gun)

Back up.

LUPUS

You want I should hold him down?

(CONTINUED)

86.

ROTTOVICH

Special Agent Gunther Moonan.     Ring a

bell?

JAKE

Gunther?    I think I'd remember a Gunther.

ROTTOVICH

Ring it for him, Sobo.

JAKE

Oh yeah.    Moonan.   I remember now.

Thanks.

ROTTOVICH

Well he's   in town and he sure as shit

remembers   you. What are we going to do

about this   Jake? We can't afford to

have a Fed   onto us.

JAKE

Wouldn't dream of it.

ROTTOVICH

I don't know what you're into with the

King Pin, but whatever it is we get a

piece, understand? We get a big piece.

If we find out you're keeping us out, I

may suddenly develope a conscious and

give you up to Moonan myself. Say

something stupid if we got a deal,

Jake.

JAKE

(gasping for breath)

Something stupid.

ROTTOVICH

Good boy.

SOBOZINSKI

And don't leave town!

(to Rottovich)

I always wanted to say that...

(CONTINUED)

87.

LILY

People don't like you much, do they?

CUT TO:

MOONAN

Did he buy it?

ROTTOVICH

I think so.    What'd he ever do to you

anyway?

MOONAN

Let's just say he burned me once.

LUPUS (V.O.)

Why's this guy so hard up for you?

You're not exactly a threat to

national security.

CUT TO:

JAKE

We go way back...

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

About four years ago, we were working

in Miami, turf fixing for some local

goon.

CUT TO:

88.

JAKE (V.O.)

Turns out this local goon was being

watched by the Feds, which means we

were being watched by the Feds. One in

particular.

JAKE (V.O.)

Special Agent Gunther Moonan.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

He didn't really have anything on us,

but I figure, maybe this guy's good

for a Fix. So I ask him out to dinner.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

These guys we have now, sure, give

them twenty bucks and they'll look the

other way on a parking ticket. But a

Fed... You get a guy like that as your

Fix...

JAKE (V.O.)

It was probably a stupid idea. There I

am, Armani and Rolex. There he is, JC

Penny and Timex...

(CONTINUED)

89.

JAKE (V.O.)

So I took a shot. But now he had me on

attempted bribery of a Federal Agent.

JAKE (V.O.)

That's when Gordo comes in with the

Hazelnut French Roast.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JAKE

And that's how Special Agent Gunther

Moonan and I became friends.

GORDO

Moonan.    Here. Shit...

LILY

So what?   We just stay clear of him.

LILY

Jesus... Take it easy.

(CONTINUED)

90.

JAKE

No, I'm not going to take it easy. You

can't stay clear of this guy. He will

be on this until the end of time.

MILES

What do we do? We change the scam?

JAKE

There is no scam!    I've got a fucking

sign on my back!    I can't leave town

now and come back   with a suitcase full

of money. You get    it? It's over. We

walk.

GORDO

Jake--

JAKE

What do I always tell you guys? Don't

spend it all. Sooner or later we're

going to run into some bad luck. Save

some. Put it away, so when shit like

this happens, you're not desperate.

That's it. The gig's up.

LILY

That's it? What are you talking about?

We can still do this!

GORDO

Jake, I mean, come on--

JAKE

No, no, no! Not  this time. I am doing

this for your own good! You guys have

got to learn when to stop. You with

the Armani! You  with the hookers!

MILES

Escorts!

JAKE

Do you even remember Al? Do you remember

what he looked like sitting there?

LILY

You are such a raving pussy sometimes.

JAKE

Hey, we fucked once, honey. That

hardly makes you a good judge of

character. And don't think I didn't

know you were working some angle with

that either.

(CONTINUED)

91.

LILY

Everyone's working an angle, right?

JAKE

There are three people I trust-- him,

him and a guy who got killed. I don't

know who you are! You're like some

stray doq that wandered into the

house. So I'm telling you to cut loose

of this. No one's looking for you, Not

the King, not Moonan and not Gillette.

Just go wherever it is you would go.

It's over.

LILY

What about...

JAKE

What about what?

LILY

What about the money?

JAKE

So there it is. You got that big itch

you need to scratch. It's all about

the fucking money. What do you want,

an apology?

LILY

No, I want my cut!

JAKE

I'm going to say this one last time for

You, so take a deep breath and count to

ten. There is no cut.

LILY

You're an asshole.

GORDO

So that's it...

JAKE

That's it.

(CONTINUED)

92.

LUPUS

King ain't gonna like this.

JAKE

Don't worry, I'll settle up with your

boss. We haven't skipped town yet.

LUPUS

What I'm saying is, is that the King

ain't gonna care. See he had a real

thing with getting this Gillette guy,

If you ask me I think he's jealous.

JAKE

Of what?   They're both crooks.

LUPUS

Exactly. `Cept this Gillette guy. He

gets to walk around in three piece

suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a

bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the

King sits holed up in the steam, afraid

to even take a leak without me or Harlin

watching the door.

JAKE

My fucking heart bleeds.

LUPUS

Your buddy. That fat guy. The King

couldn't wait to have that guy

whacked. He didn't even know who the

guy was, but he was so pissed off at

him, he gets him drilled. It ain't

personal. It's business.

JAKE

Point, Lupus. Give us a point.

LUPUS

Point is, you don't go through with

this, he's going to go after you next.

And he don't even like you, Jake.

CUT TO:

BUTCH

So much for honor among thieves. You

would have cut loose your friends, your

girl...

(CONTINUED)

93.

JAKE

I was doing it for them.

BUTCH

BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You -

Lost your nerve! You lost your

confidence! You weren't being noble.

You weren't trying to save anybody but

yourself! Admit it.

JAKE

It's not true.

BUTCH

Yes it is Jake! Yes it is! They were

right there for you. She was right

there for you! Look at her!

BUTCH (cont'd)

She trusted you and you sold her out!

Be honest! Be a man! Tell her, Jake!

Tell her that you loved her but the

money meant more to you!

BUTCH (cont'd)

Grifters... Gentleman's racket... My

ass. You're just any other lowlife

stammer-- Looking out for number one.

CUT TO:

LUPUS

Hey, boss. It's me. The bank's in.

It's happening tomorrow... Jake?

LUPUS (cont' d)

He got a little shaky there for a minute,

but we got him back in the batter's

box.

CUT TO:

94.

LUPUS (O.S.)

Coupla things. They got this Fed , loo

king around and the girl just split.

KING PIN

A Fed?    Is he close?

LUPUS (O.S.)

I don't think so. Their Fix gave us

the heads up and Jake's got a plan

that'll probably keep him off.

LUPUS

But this girl, the redhead. She knows

a lot. She could be a pain in the ass.

JAKE

No. She won't. She's not going to be

a problem.

LUPU

He wants to talk to you.

(whispering)

Don't tell him I said he was jealous

of Gillette, okay?

JAKE

Uh huh... Uh huh... Okay... I understand.

LUPUS

What'd he say?

JAKE

Oh,    you know... Don't fuck this up.

I'll    kill you. I'll kill your family.

I'll    shoot your dog... All the usual.

Then    he said good luck.

(CONTINUED)

95.

JAKE

Aww, shit!

CUT TO:

JAKE

We were back on.

BUTCH

After you cut her loose.

JAKE

She walked.

LILY

I walked? Let me tell you a story,

asshole...

HARLIN (0.S.)

Lily?

HARLIN (O. S.)

.Jake sent me.

LILY

Jake? Hold on. I just got out of the

shower.

96.

LILY

HOLD ON!

HARLIN

The King would like to have a word

with you.

LILY

Uh, right now?

HARLI

Please.    I have a car waiting.

HARLIN

JAKE

Sorry.   I didn't know...

LILY

Your friend, Big Al?   It should have

been you.

BUTCH

Alrlght, alrlght.   What happened today?

JAKE

Today?   Started off great...

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

98.

JAKE (V.O.)

Ashby was going to call us with the

exact time of the transfer. The King

was waiting on us. Just to be safe...

CUT TO:

JAKE (V . O .

Gordo went down to the Caymens instead

of me. I needed Rottovich and

Sobozinski to keep Moonan off our backs

and the only way I could do that was to

stay in town and cut them in on the

deal.

CUT T0:

JAKE (V.O.)

So they waited for my call while Miles

and I waited for Ashby's call.

CUT T0:

MILES

He should be landing in the Caymens

about now. The Custom's guy is ready

right?

JAKE

Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a

penny-- Heads up. There was an empty

cab right outside my building. We hit

every green light.

MILES

And we got rid of the red head.

(CONTINUED)

99.

JAKE

And we got rid of the red head.

MILES

Jake?   Customs?

(V.O.)

They say a good chess player can. See

up to twenty moves deep. That means

that in some games, you've calculated

every possible move in your head... The

game's over before it's even " really

started.

JAKE (V.O.)

Same thing with playing a con. You

have to be able to see that deep.

ASHBY

Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah,

it's going through--

ASHBY (coat' d)

Now.

CUT T0:

JAKE (V.O.)

In order to ensure that we weren't going

to welch, Ashby's pay-off was to be

directly deposited into his own offshore

account which he could confirm

electronically. In this age of

ecommerce, paper currency has become "

more of a liability than a commodity.

Especially to us.

100.

JAKE

(into phone)

Go.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Gordo was making the withdrawal from

the Grand Laymen's Bank.

JAKE (V. O. )

They check the papers...

JAKE (V.O.)

...They stick.

CUT TO:

GORDO

First and ten.

(CONTINUED)

101.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Then he had to bang it out across the

street at the Bank of the Caymens...

GORDO

I'd like this cashed, please.

GORDO (cont'd )

I also need to deduct a certain amount

and deposit it into this account number.

CUT TO:

MAR I E

Mr. Ashby? Mr. Thompson from

International with a 34R on a

corporate account.

ASHBY

Probably just a new account marker.

(standing)

Tell him I already left for lunch and

that I'll call him later.

CUT TO:

102.

BANK OFFICIAL

We'll let you have a moment.

JAKE (V.O.)

We called them Green Twinkies.

CUT TO:

GORDO

We got Twinkies.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Miles was on his way to the airport to

wait for Gordo to land. I made the

call.

JAKE

Yeah, it's me. I need an escort. Not

a ride, just an escort. You wanted in,

this is in.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

103.

JAKE (O.S.)

Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo

with a black suitcase. You got Moonan

under control?

ROTTOVICH

Don't worry about Moonan. We got him

covered. When..?

(hanging up)

It was him. There's a shipment coming

through tonight. Kennedy.

MOONAN

Shipment of what?

(off Rottovich's shrug)

Find two cars. And change into plain

clothes.

MOONAN

It's Moonan. Tonight. JFK.

International terminal. Come heavy.

CUT TO:

LUPUS

So that's it, huh? You get the cops to

give you a safe ride.

JAKE

Let me ask you something... You really

think I'm going to come this close,

this fucking close and let my guard

down? I'll get square with your boss.

I'll get square with whoever did Al.

I'll get square with everybody. Then

I'm going going to cash in my chips

and be on my way to a new and better

me far away from here.

LUPUS

You're a weasal.

(CONTINUED)

104.

LUPUS

Yeah... He's landing with the money at

Kennedy in a few hours. International

Terminal. You were right. He's trying

to fuck you. You want it, you gotta

get it at the airport...

CUT TO:

KING PIN

He's got pigs for an escort.   You

believe this guy?

HARLIN

I'll get the car.

KING PIN

Always something.

KING PIN (cont' d)

My ass look big in this?

HARLIN

Looks fine, Boss.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

105.

CUT TO:

SOSOZINSKI

You trust this Moonan guy?

ROTTOVICH

I don't trust anybody. You see   how bad

this guy wants Vig? It's like a

sickness. I say we collar Vig

ourselves. We got Vig, then we   got

leverage. And we trade; Vig for   that

tape. I want to see it right in   front

of my face.

SOBOZINSKI

It's just insurance.

ROTTOVICH

That's what I'm talking about.

SOBOZINSKI

I'm down!

ROTTOVICH

What are you doing?

SOBOZINSKI

High five.

ROTTOVICH

Put your hand down. I don't high five.

MOONAN

You guys awake?

ROTTOVICH

(into walkie)

We're here.

CUT TO:

106.

MOONAN

Stay sharp.

CUT TO:

MR. HEAVYSET

Oh jeez.

CUT TO:

JAKE

Gordo.

CUT TO:

GORDO

I'm landing in about fifteen minutes.

MR. HEAVYSET

Jeez... I tell ya, this airline food

goes right through me every time.

GORDO

You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?

(CONTINUED)

107.

JAKE (O.S.)

What? No.   Use the bathroom on the

plane!

GORDO

Let me just say that there is no way

I'm using the bathroom on this plane.

CUT TO:

JAKE

He's wheeling around two million dollars

in cash and he wants to stop to use the

bathroom. You believe this?

LUPUS

Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're

all just looking for a safe place to

shit.

JAKE

That was fucking deep.

CUT TO:

KING PIN

Speak.

LUPUS (O.S.)

He's landing. He's got a suitcase on

wheels.

KING PIN

So do half the other people in this

place. How do I know which one?

LUPUS (O.S.)

I got it figured out... He's got this

thing with bathrooms. If he makes it

through Customs, he'll be heading for

the john.

(CONTINUED)

108.

KING PIN

Good. Good.     Do not let Vig out of

your sight.

CUT TO:

JAKE

What's up with you?   Bladder infection?

LUPUS

Keep it up.

LILY (O.S.)

You got my cell. Leave a message.

JAKE

It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's

happening. Gordo's landing right now.

Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut,

I mean. It's... I want you to have it.

LUPUS

You really like that bitch don't you?

I gotta tell you, I was pretty

convinced that the whole thing before

was blowing her off for her cut. You

know how it is, get her to do some

shit for you, throw her a bang to keep

her happy. But, if you're into her...

That's cool.

JAKE

That's what I like about you, Lupus.

You're a free thinker. Don't let the

King tell you different.

LIONEL

Not for nothing, Jake, but the guy who

whacked your buddy? It was me. The

King usually farms out for that kind of

stuff, but I tell ya, he was so pissed

off he couldn't wait for the regular

guy. Fucker didn't even put down his

Kung Pao Chicken.

(CONTINUED)

109.

JAKE

Egg Foo Young.

(standing)

Stand up.

LUPUS

What?

JAKE

Stand up.

LUPUS

(laughing)

No offense, but I've seen you fight.

You gotta be kidding m-

JAKE

I said stand up.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

This is probably about where you came

in.

GILLETTE

Wow. Now that's an exciting story.

Butch, has anyone ever tried something

like this before?

BUTCH

Not that I recall.   What do you want us

to do about it?

GILLETTE

Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to

Customs and he gets caught. We get our

money back, but then we have to deal

with a criminal investigation. I don't

much like that idea. Then again, let's

suppose he actually gets through

Customs. Now, that'll be something.

We recover the money in cash and let

the insurance cover the corporate fraud.

We double our money.

(CONTINUED)

110.

BUTCH

So we go to the bar.

GILLETTE

I think so. The airport's going to be

crawling with police. Traffic will be

a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If

they pull it off, great. Have someone

deal with Ashby.

BUTCH

We'll take care of it.

GILLETTE

And how much did you say you wanted for

this... What did you call it? A finder's

fee?

LIL

Ten percent.

GILLETTE

Ten?    That seems a little high.

BUTCH

Ten is standard, sir.

GILLETTE

Fine.    But only if we recover the cash.

LILY

Only if--?    No way.     I want something

for this.

GILLETTE

Have a   little faith in him, honey.

Butch,   see if you can get him to tell

you how   he did it. Or almost did it.

Sounds   like a good story.

BUTCH

I' ll ask.

GILLETTE

Apple?

CUT TO:

111.

MOONAN

I got him.

CUT TO:

MOONAN (O.S.)

He's headed towards the eastern most

exit. Do not, under any circumstances

approach. I want to follow this all

the way down to Vig.

SOBOZINSK

(into walkie)

Roger that.

ROTTOVICH

Oh yeah, we'll wait, jerk-off.

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

112.

MOONAN

(into mic)

He just went into the crapper.

Hold your positions.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

MOONAN

(into mic)

They pulled a switch.   Big guy.   Blue

suit. Keep on him.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

113.

MOONAN

Hello?   Can you hear me?

CUT TO:

ROTTOVICH

Hey asshole.

CUT TO:

JAKE

Eww-Whoa?

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

114.

MILES

Jake! I don't know what's going on!

The King Pin... He's here and he just

got pinched. I think with the

twinkies! It looks like half the

police department's down here!

CUT TO:

LUPUS

What happened?

JAKE

(w/ the gun still in

his mouth)

Eee Oott Auught!

LUPUS

(pulling the gun out)

Sorry. What?

JAKE

HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull

a switch and he got us all fucking

pinched!

LUPUS

Shit.

JAKE

Aaaaiiit!!!    Ooopusss!!

115.

JAKE (V.O.)

I never thanked you for that.

CUT TO:

BUTCH

You're welcome.

LILY

Can we please all stop being so

goddamnfucking-polite and get to the

point?

BUTCH

Right.   Where's the money, Jake?

JAKE

What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee?

Because it is all about the money,

right?

LILY

You sold me out. You should have trusted

me like I trusted you. You fucked up.

You fucked up HUGE.

BUTCH

Alright... Turn around. She doesn't

get shit, unless I get that money.

Where is it?

JAKE

Probably safe in the hands of the Federal

Government.

BUTCH

Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you

just let Lily here down again.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

116.

BUTCH (cont'd)

What was it you said about playing the

big con?

JAKE

It's like putting on a play, where

everyone knows their part except for

the mark.

BUTCH

Like putting on a play... Guess some

people forgot their lines.

JAKE

Guess so.

BUTCH

So why don't you take a deep breath,

Jake, and I'll count to ten. One.

Two. Three...

JAKE

I do trust you, Lily.

BUTCH

Wha-

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Trust...

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

117.

JAKE (V.O.)

It should be a four letter word.

CUT TO:

BUTCH

Jesus Christ! Tell me before you do

something like that!

BUTCH

You should leave.

JAKE (V.O.)

So I'm dead...

JAKE (V . O . )

But maybe I can't blame Lily. Maybe I

just should have just trusted her to

play her part. Because playing the big

con is like putting on a play. A play

where everyone knows their part except

for the Mark...

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

118.

JAKE

Just watch everything you say around

him. Every word, every move... It all

goes back to the King Pin. Get it?

CUT TO:

JAKE

You have no idea what you've done do

you? No idea! What is this?

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

You tell them the "Tale".

JAKE

What do you want?    An apology?

LILY

No, I want my cut!

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

And like in a game of chess, you've

played every possible move in your

head...

LUPUS

You were right. He's trying to fuck

you. You want it, you gotta get it at

the airport...

CUT TO:

119.

JAKE (V.O.)

Then you give them the "Blow-off".     You

get them off your back. Forever.

ROTTOVICH

We're on the job! We're active in the

one-six.

IA OFFICER#1

Officers Rottovich and Sobozinski?

SOBOZINSKI

Fuck me...

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

But most of all, you need the "Fix".

CUT TO:

JAKE

That's how Special Agent Gunther Moonan

and I became friends.

(CONTINUED)

120.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

Like Suits said, sooner or later

someone's going to start asking the

right questions.

JAKE (V.O.)

Rottovich and Sobozinski would ask how

the drugs got in that suitcase. The

King and Gillette would ask where the

money really went.

JAKE (V.O.)

And all of them would ask what agency

Special Agent Gunther Moonan worked

for.

CUT TO:

JAKE (V.O.)

But what do I care? I'm dead...

CUT TO:

(CONTINUED)

121.

JAKE (V.O.)

No one's going to ask me:

JAKE

Drop something?

LILY

(innocently)

Oops.

JAKE (V.O.)

Redheads...

FADE TO BLACK:

THE END.
