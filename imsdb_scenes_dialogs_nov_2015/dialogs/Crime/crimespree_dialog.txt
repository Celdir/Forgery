FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

DANIEL

(whispering)

Turn on the flashlight.

JULIEN

I'm trying.    It doesn't work.

DANIEL

It has to work. You just bought it this

afternoon.

JULIEN

Do they come with batteries?

DANIEL

You didn't buy batteries?

JULIEN

I thought they came with batteries.

DANIEL

I can't believe you didn't check.

JULIEN

I bought everything you put on the list.

Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight.

Batteries were not on the list.

DANIEL

Why should I have to put it on the list?

It's like saying to buy a car with tires.

2.

DANIEL

Let's go.

DANIEL

Be careful it's...

DANIEL

... hot!

DANIEL

Light your lighter. I can't see

anything... and try not to burn down

the house!

OLD MAN'S VOICE

Don't move!

JULIEN

Is he dead?

DANIEL

I don't know.     He looks dead.

3.

JULIEN

He looked dead before he fell.

DANIEL

Start the car! Start the car!

JULIEN

You didn't think to move the car before

we came out!

DANIEL

Raymond, get us out of here!

DANIEL

(to Raymond)

You know what makes a good get away

driver?

(More)

4.

DANIEL (Cont'd)

(controlled anger)

Being able to get away!

RAYMOND

You're always pointing out my negative

qualities. My analyst says positive

reinforcement is a much more productive

way of relating with people.

JULIEN

Fine. Raymond, we'd like to commend you

on how well you fucked up tonight.

MARCEL

(amused)

I heard you almost got your ass blown

off last night. Some thief. A regular

black panther.

RAYMOND

A Black Panther was a member of an African

American militant group in the sixties,

Marcel. I think you're referring to The

Pink Panther.

MARCEL

Pink panther, black panther. Who gives

a shit? And I don't remember asking you

a God Damn thing, you little turd.

RAYMOND

There's no reason to be abusive. You're

projecting your anger on me as a defense

mechanism.

MARCEL

What the hell is he talking about?

RAYMOND

I'm talking about human beings

communicating openly and honestly.

5.

MARCEL

How about getting on your knees and

communicating with my dick?

BASTALDI

Shut up! Both of you!    You're giving me

a fuckin' headache.

DANIEL

Where's your brother?

BASTALDI

Vincent's in the States on business.

(a beat; referring to

the painting)

That it?

BASTALDI

Okay.   Now I've got something I want to --

BASTALDI

Do you mind? I'm trying to do some

business here.

BASTALDI

One more sound out of you and I'm going

to cut your fuckin' tongue out.

BASTALDI

You take someone in. Give them a steady

job and how do they repay you? By

claiming to misplace a shipment of your

merchandise.

RAYMOND

Maybe he did misplace it.

BASTALDI

You misplace your car keys.   You misplace

your cell phone.

(More)

6.

BASTALDI (Cont'd)

You do not misplace one hundred and forty

seven wide-screen TV's!

DANIEL

Laurant, how long has he been in there?

BASTALDI

I don't know.     What day is today?

JULIEN

Thursday.

BASTALDI

Is it Thursday already?    This week has

just shot by.

BASTALDI

You and your crew speak English, don't

you?

BASTALDI

Hey Daniel! Hello?

(snaps his fingers)

Do you guys speak English?

DANIEL

Uh, yeah.

BASTALDI

Good.   I have a job for you in America.

BASTALDI

The Taylors from Chicago. Very rich.

An acquaintance of mine recently quit

working for Mrs. Taylor as an assistant.

She tells me they keep all their jewelry

in a safe in their bedroom.

JULIEN

It seems like a long way to go for a

necklace.

DANIEL

Besides, we don't know the city and--

MARCEL

(overlapping)

Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you

want to go.

(More)

7.

MARCEL (Cont'd)

He's telling you you're going! And if

he's telling you you're going to be going

then you are going to go!

BASTALDI

Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely

redundant explanation.

DANIEL

C'mon, Laurant, America?

BASTALDI

The job is worth about two million euros.

Pull this off and you and your crew could

make some real money, Daniel. You leave

tomorrow.

JULIEN

We're going to need to find someone who

knows the city.

MARCEL

I know someone.

8.

MARCEL

Going somewhere?

SAMI

Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody

else. If I knew it was you I would have

never run.

SAMI

You're probably here for the money I owe

you.

(off Marcel's nod)

I don't have it.

SAMI

You know this is how rumors get started.

SAMI

Told you.

MARCEL

Today's your lucky day, Sami.

SAMI

(breathlessly)

Yeah, I can see that.

MARCEL

Normally I'd be breaking your fingers

right now, but I'm going to give you a

chance to make enough to pay me back and

have some extra for yourself. We have a

group going to Chicago to do a job.

You're going with them.

9.

SAMI

Me?

MARCEL

You lived there. You know the city.

SAMI

I've still got a few legal problems back

in the States.

SAMI

(nervously)

But I'd be... I'd be happy to go.

MARCEL

If you try to leave town I'll know. If

you manage to leave town I'll find you...

and the next time we meet in a bathroom

I'll be cutting you up into little pieces.

MARCEL

Be at this address at nine o'clock

tomorrow morning.

RAYMOND

(in French)

Yes, Mama. Yes, I have my vitamins. I

have everything. Of course I'm coming

back. I'm not leaving you. I'm only

going to be gone a few days. I'll call

you when I get there. Okay? I've got

to go now.

(listens)

Mama, I've got to go.

(listens)

No, I'm not yelling.

SAMI

I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.

JULIEN

What is it you do, Sami?

10.

SAMI

You know, a little of this, a little of

that. I've boosted cars, stole radios,

run a few scams. Right now I'm into

pick-pocketing.

JULIEN

I see.   A master criminal.

SAMI

Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel.

You guys don't want me, I'll be more

than happy to leave.

DANIEL

(to Sami)

This is Zero.

SAMI

Hi. I'm one and this is two, three,

four and five.

JULIEN

Let me give you some advice. You don't

want to piss him off because he'll kill

you for the fun of it. What you want to

do is keep your mouth shut and do what

we tell you.

ZERO

(in French)

So, we are going to America?

DANIEL

In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.

ZERO

Where are you from?

SAMI

Algeria.

ZERO

And you don't speak French?

11.

SAMI

Well, you know, not all Algerians speak

French. It's a matter of what school

you went too. Me I never really --

ZERO

(overlapping)

-- Zero isn't interested in your life

story.

(to Daniel)

Who gets killed?

DANIEL

Hopefully no one.

ZERO

(confused)

No one? Then why is Zero here?

SAMI

He speaks about himself in the third

person?

RAYMOND

Feel free to correct him if you want.

DANIEL

(to Zero)

I just want you there in case there's

trouble.

ZERO

And if there is, then Zero can kill

someone?

DANIEL

We'll see.

BASTALDI

(to Daniel)

I thought I would accompany you to the

airport to say bon voyage... and tell

you that Marcel will be going with you.

DANIEL

What?

BASTALDI

This is a considerable move up for you,

Daniel. The temptation of having so

much money might be too much for you.

12.

DANIEL

You don't trust me?

BASTALDI

I don't trust anyone. You don't get to

the top of this game by trusting people...

and after all, you are a thief. It's in

your nature to steal. I'm just protecting

my investment.

MARCEL

That's better.

BASTALDI

Stop it!   Both of you!

MARCEL

(singing)

... que je t'aime... que je...

13.

TAXI DRIVER

Are you sure you guys have the right

address? This ain't no tourist area.

MARCEL

Yes.   We are sure.

SAMI

Let me handle this.

SAMI

Hey, brother.     What's happening, man?

LAMAR

Don't you brother me, motherfucker.

LAMAR

What's in the bags?

JULIEN

Dirty underwear.

LAMAR

Dirty underwear. That's a good one.

Let me explain something to you. This

is my street and you're gonna give me

want I what or I'm gonna bust your heads

open.

RAYMOND

Lamar, violence is never an answer to

settling disputes. I can see you have a

lot of anger... but this is not the way

to get it out.

14.

LAMAR

Get outta my face!

LAMAR

Now, are you going to give me the

suitcases? Or are we going to have to

take them?

ZERO

Va te faire foutre!

LAMAR

What did he say?

DANIEL

He said to go fuck yourself.

ZERO

We are tired and bored with your bullshit.

So, put that stupid little knife away

before Zero shoves it up your ass.

LAMAR

Who is Zero?

JULIEN

He is.

LAMAR

(to Julien)

He speaks about himself in the third

person?

LAMAR

Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass

and take my knife from me?

ZERO

If you insist.

ZERO

Leave now before Zero shoots off those

little raisins you call balls.

15.

SAMI

You put a loaded gun in your bag and

brought it through customs? How stupid

is that?

ZERO

Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put

it in yours.

MARCEL

We are looking for Sophie.    Laurant send

us.

SAMI

(softly)

Ouh La La.

SOPHIE

I wasn't expecting this many of you.

I've got a few sleeping bags you can

use.

SAMI

Thanks.

SOPHIE

(to all of them)

This is Wayne. My roommate.

RAYMOND

I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us

to stay here.

16.

WAYNE

No problem, man.

(offers him the bong)

Hey, you wanna hit?

RAYMOND

No thank you.

RAYMOND

Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and

quite well known in France.

WAYNE

Yeah, I dig him.

RAYMOND

Although a cartoon I feel he shares a

universal theme: We are all searching

for love. No?

WAYNE

Whoa...   That's deep.

SOPHIE

You guys hungry?

WAITRESS

Ready to order?

JULIEN

Could we see a wine list please?

WAITRESS

(smirks)

That's cute.

SOPHIE

They don't have a wine list.

JULIEN

Oh, then we will have the house wine.

WAITRESS

Sure -- and would you like that before

your escargot in white truffle sauce?

17.

JULIEN

I did not order escargot.

SAMI

They don't serve wine here.

JULIEN

What kind of restaurant doesn't serve

wine?

SAMI

This kind.

JULIEN

Okay.    I will have a beer.

WAITRESS

I don't think he's grasping the concept.

Iced tea, lemonade, coca cola, sprite or

root beer.

JULIEN

(to the others)

C'est quoi root beer?

DANIEL

He'll have a sprite.    We'll all have

sprite.

WAITRESS

Good. Now that we've gotten the beverage

selection out of the way, dare we move

on to the main course?

ZERO

Idiot.

WAITRESS

And no smoking.

ZERO

(in French)

No smoking? No drinking?       What kind of

country is this?

CUT TO:

18.

VINNY

(frightened)

I'm sorry, Frankie.     Really.

ZAMMITO

You bleed on me, I'll kill ya.

ZAMMITO

What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd

I tell you when you came to me for money?

Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I

not say that?

(to Joey)

What'd I say to him?

JOEY "TWO TONS"

You said don't do it, boss.

ZAMMITO

That's right. I said don't do it. Did

you listen to me? No. You wanted the

money. So, I lent you twenty large.

Now it's been three weeks and you ain't

paid a dime. What do you think that

makes me look like on the street? I

don't do something to you and everyone

will think they can skate.

VINNY

Frankie, I --

ZAMMITO

-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me

feel bad about this. You knew what would

happen to you if you didn't pay. This

is on your head, not mine.

(to Joey and Nicky)

Break his arm.

VINNY

Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!

19.

ZAMMITO

That's why we're only breaking one arm.

SOPHIE

There's an exterior alarm system. There's

also another one in the hall that leads

to the bedroom with a motion detector.

The control panel is in the bedroom.

JULIEN

I can handle the exterior alarm, but the

one in the bedroom is a problem.

SAMI

After the outside alarm is off we go in

through the bedroom window.

DANIEL

(impressed)

Good. Zero and Julien will go in through

the window and disable the motion

detector. The rest of us will come in

through the front door.

JULIEN

What about transportation?

SOPHIE

You can use my car.

DANIEL

Not a good idea. Someone gets a license

number and it all leads back to you.

Raymond, you'll steal one.

RAYMOND

No problem.

SAMI

When do we go?

SOPHIE

Tonight.

DANIEL

Tonight?

SOPHIE

I know they won't be home tonight.

SAMI

You ever hear of jet lag?

20.

SOPHIE

Take a nap.

JULIEN

What the hell is that?

WAYNE

Neighbors.    They do this all the time.

SAMI

I can't even hear myself think.

ZERO

How are we supposed to sleep with this

noise?

SOPHIE

I've asked them a hundred times to keep

in down. They don't listen.

RAYMOND

I will talk to them.

WAYNE

Yeah.   Right.

SOPHIE

Not a good idea.

RAYMOND

It's just a matter of communication.

21.

RAYMOND

(cheerfully; loudly

over the music)

Hello. My name is Raymond. I am visiting

next door and I was wondering if you

could make your music a little less loud.

BIKER

No.

RAYMOND

But the music is very--

BIKER

Fuck off!

BIKER

Listen asshole, I told you --

22.

WAYNE

(impressed)

What'd you say to them?

MARCEL

(dryly)

Nothing.

ZAMMITO

Hey, Bobby beans... How you doin'?

BOBBY BEANS

Good. I'm doing good. How you doin',

Frankie?

ZAMMITO

Good.   I'm good.

BOBBY BEANS

Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.

ZAMMITO

When you return please extend my regards

to Mr. Maranzano and his family.

ZAMMITO

Can I offer you something.    A drink?

Coffee?

BOBBY BEANS

No thank you.

23.

ZAMMITO

BOBBY BEANS

ZAMMITO

BOBBY BEANS

ZAMMITO

(overlapping)

BOBBY BEANS

ZAMMITO

BOBBY BEANS

ZAMMITO

BOBBY BEANS

ZAMMITO

BOBBY BEANS

ZAMMITO

BOBBY BEANS

24.

ZAMMITO

Yeah -- you do that.

ZAMMITO

Jerk-wad!

ZAMMITO

How's my brother?

NICKY "THE RAKE"

He's over at St. James. They had to put

two pins in his arm.

ZAMMITO

I said a clean break.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Hey boss, it's not a science.

ZAMMITO

Send some flowers. Something nice.

Roses or carnations. And one of those

get well soon cards.

ZAMMITO

Oh and uh, send a case of steaks over to

his house. I don't want the kids to go

hungry while he's recuperating.

SOPHIE

You like shoes?

SAMI

No, I like the bag. It would be good

for the job tonight.

SOPHIE

It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left

it last time he was here. I'm sure he

wouldn't mind if you used it.

SOPHIE

So, how did you get hooked up with these

guys?

25.

SAMI

Just lucky I guess. How'd you start

working for the Bastaldi's?

SOPHIE

The art world doesn't fully appreciate

my talent yet. I needed some way to pay

the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well

for information.

SAMI

So you arranged to have the people you

worked for robbed?

SOPHIE

They're not nice people.

SOPHIE

I like your tattoo.

SOPHIE

(reading the name)

Casandra. Old girlfriend?

SAMI

Something like that.

SOPHIE

Did she break your heart?

SAMI

Something like that.

SOPHIE

It looks old.     Did you get it a long

time ago?

SAMI

You ask a lot of questions.

SOPHIE

That's how you get to know someone.       Did

it hurt when you got it?

SAMI

I don't remember.    I was drunk.

SOPHIE

You got it in a bar?

SAMI

No. I got it in prison. I went in for

three years. When I came out she was

married to my best friend. Happy?

26.

SOPHIE

Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.

SAMI

It's okay.   It was a long time ago.

SOPHIE

I've been thinking about getting tattoo.

You know, a flower or something. On my

ass.

SAMI

Who's gonna see it there?

SOPHIE

The lucky ones.

RAPHAEL

Gimme the money!

RAPHAEL

Open the safe!

OLD MAN

I don't have the combination.

OLD MAN

I swear!   I don't have it!

27.

HECTOR

Hey, Vato, where's your car?

RAPHAEL

My car!

JULIEN

It's Raymond.     He's outside with the

car.

SOPHIE

For luck.

SAMI

I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.

RAYMOND

Watch this.

28.

HECTOR

Maybe you should call the police.

RAPHAEL

Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and

a stolen radio in the car.

HECTOR

I just thought that--

RAPHAEL

(overlapping)

-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good

at it.

RAPHAEL

Go do something -- get some beers for

the guys.

RAPHAEL

When I find out who did this I'm going

to mount their head on my dashboard!

ZAMMITO

(into phone)

Yeah?

HALF TOOTH TONY (V.O.)

Mr. B. wants to see you.

ZAMMITO

Now? I've got a date with a drop dead

major babe.

HALF TOOTH TONY (V.O.)

I'll tell him that.

ZAMMITO

Okay.    I'm coming.

29.

ZAMMITO

Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives

tell her I had an emergency.

MARIO

Of course, Mr. Zammito.

RAYMOND (V.O.)

I think we went the wrong way.

SAMI (V.O.)

Oh, you think?

MARCEL (V.O.)

The map said to go left.

JULIEN (V.O.)

Yeah and if you turned it around it would

say to go right.

MARCEL (V.O.)

(amused)

Oh yeah.

BONANNO

Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You

want something?

ZAMMITO

No, I'm good, Angelo.

BONANNO

I understand Bobby Beans came to see you

today.

ZAMMITO

Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk

about buying the Merchant Street

warehouse.

BONANNO

And?

ZAMMITO

And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.

30.

BONANNO

He's trying to get a foot hold in our

territory.

ZAMMITO

He sticks his toes in the water again,

we'll cut 'em off.

BONANNO

Business must be good if he can afford

to buy up useless property.

ZAMMITO

I heard this quarter his profits are

gonna be supernumerary.

BONANNO

They're gonna be what?

ZAMMITO

Supernumerary. It means better than

expected.

BONANNO

Good word.

HALF TOOTH TONY

Mr. Bonanno, I just wanted to remind you

that you have an appointment in ten

minutes.

ZAMMITO

Someone else coming?

BONANNO

Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling

me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes.

You ever watch it?

ZAMMITO

Uh, no --

BONANNO

You should. You can learn a lot about

the criminal justice system on a program

like that. Very informative. Stay and

watch it with me.

ZAMMITO

You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just

gonna go home if it's all the same to

you.

31.

BONANNO

Go.   Rest.

BONANNO

Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about

your brother?

ZAMMITO

He missed three weeks.

BONANNO

Your own brother? You couldn't send

someone else to do it?

ZAMMITO

I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The

Rake" did the deed.

BONANNO

But you were there?

ZAMMITO

Angelo, we live and die by the rules we

make. We are men of honor, but honor

without respect is a... horse-less

carriage.

BONANNO

What the fuck does that mean?

DANIEL

(to Raymond)

Park on the next street over.   We'll

meet you when we're done.

32.

ZERO

We're in.

DANIEL

So much for no one being home.

JULIEN

At least they got this right.

33.

SAMI

We've got to be careful not to use our

real names while we're in here.

DANIEL

Good idea.

SAMI

I'll be Elvis and you--

MARCEL

(overlapping)

-- I want to be Elvis.

SAMI

It's my idea.

MARCEL

(whining)

C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you

do.

SAMI

Okay.   You can be Elvis.

SAMI

And the rest of us are...    John, Paul,

George and Ringo.

MARCEL

Hey, Barry Bonds. The home run king.

MARCEL

It's for my nephew.

AGENT HADLEY

Looks like Zammito's being robbed.

FBI AGENT

Should I call C.P.D.?

34.

AGENT HADLEY

Yeah, but tell them not to move until

these morons come out of the house.

JULIEN

Where are the jewels?   There aren't any

jewels.

MARCEL

There has to be.

JULIEN

I'm telling you I've pulled out everything

in the safe. There aren't any jewels.

MARCEL

There must be half a million dollars

here though.

DANIEL

Marcel, we came here for jewels, remember?

SAMI

(babbling nervously)

We have a problem. Problem isn't the

right word. Dilemma. No that really

doesn't describe --

(flatly)

Do you know who that is?

MARCEL

Mr. Taylor?

SAMI

No, that's not Mr. Taylor.

DANIEL

(sensing something

bad is coming)

It's not?

35.

SAMI

That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss

of the Chicago Mafia.

MARCEL

(confused)

Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?

SAMI

(screaming)

WE'RE IN THE WRONG HOUSE, YOU FUCKIN'

IDIOT!

MARCEL

Mr. Zammito, there seems to have been a

big mistake here. May I use your phone?

ZAMMITO

Feel free.

QUICK CUT TO:

BASTALDI

Hello?

MARCEL (V.O.)

(in French)

It's Elvis...

BASTALDI

Who?

MARCEL (V.O.)

(in French)

It's me...

BASTALDI

Marcel?

CUT BACK TO:

MARCEL

(in French)

Yes.

(More)

36.

MARCEL (Cont'd)

We went to the address we were given and

had to tie up the owner of the house who

turns out to be some Mafia guy.

BASTALDI (V.O.)

(in French)

You're there now?

MARCEL

Oui.

BASTALDI

(in French)

You're calling me on your cell phone,

right?

MARCEL

No.

BASTALDI (V.O.)

(in French)

You're calling me on is phone?

MARCEL

Oui.

BASTALDI (V.O.)

(in French)

My number's going to show up on his bill!

MARCEL

(In French)

Should I call you back?

BASTALDI (V.O.)

(in French)

You've already robbed the safe?

MARCEL

Oui.

BASTALDI (V.O.)

(in French)

Take what you've got and get out of there.

ZAMMITO

Walk out of here with nothing and I'll

forget this ever happened.

SAMI

Yeah. Right.     You're not a vendetta

kind of guy.

37.

ZAMMITO

I'll find you. No matter where you go

I'll find you.

DANIEL

You don't carry the same weight in France

as you do here.

MARCEL

You think it's smart to tell him we're

French?

DANIEL

I think he's already figured that out.

ZERO

We are being watched.

DANIEL

Cops?

ZAMMITO

FBI. They've been there for months.

Think I don't know. Morons.

JULIEN

What do we do?

MARCEL

I was told to take what we have and go.

JULIEN

Go where?   The police are outside.

DANIEL

If we do this we all have to agree.

JULIEN

I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --

38.

SAMI

C'mon, get real, will you. You think

he's just going to forget about this?

These guys are all about respect. All

about honor. He's coming after us, so

we might as well take the money.

ZAMMITO

You're all dead.

SOPHIE (V.O.)

Wayne, who is it?

SOPHIE

I wasn't expecting you guys back so fast.

How'd it go?

SAMI

How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how

would you say it went?

DANIEL

I would have to say... pretty fuckin'

bad. You gave us the wrong address

Sophie.

39.

SOPHIE

No, I didn't.

JULIEN

Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?

SOPHIE

Yes.

JULIEN

And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.

SOPHIE

No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.

DANIEL

That moron.

MARCEL

It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway...

Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.

DANIEL

Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving

in the morning.

AGENT HADLEY

What the hell are they doing in there?

FBI AGENT

Chicago P.D. says they can't hold the

units here any longer. They want to

know if they should go in?

AGENT HADLEY

Tell them no.     We'll advise if anything

changes.

40.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Yeah?

JOEY "TWO TONS"

(quietly)

Hmmm.... Oh yeah... Uh huh

JOEY "TWO TONS"

That's right baby, give it to papa Joey.

JOEY "TWO TONS" WIFE

Joey, who is that?

JOEY "TWO TONS"

(loudly; for his wife's

sake)

-- And don't call here again, you pervert.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Yeah boss?

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Boss?

41.

RAPHAEL

Someone stole my car tonight!

FELIX

C'mon Raphael, you don't think that I

would steal your car?

RAPHAEL

You run a chop shop for low riders.

Yes, I think you'd steal my car.

FELIX

I swear I didn't. I wouldn't!

RAPHAEL

And I should just believe--

HECTOR

(overlapping; to Felix)

-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.

RAPHAEL

(to Hector)

Hector, don't interrupt me.

HECTOR

He told Enrique he didn't know anything

about his car.

RAPHAEL

I don't give a shit about your cousin's

car. We're here about my car. So, shut

your mouth! You think you can do that?

You think you can keep your big mouth

shut?

RAPHAEL

If I find out you're lying. If I find

out you know anything about this I'm

going to come back and cut off your nose.

RAPHAEL

(to the others)

Vamos.

42.

FBI AGENT

Sir, do you think we could have a hostage

situation in there?

AGENT HADLEY

Hold on a second. Joey "Two Tons" just

pulled up.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Jesus, Boss!

ZAMMITO

They were all French guys.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

French guys?    You mean like from France?

ZAMMITO

(with strained patience)

Yeah, French guys from France.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

What'd they take?

ZAMMITO

Everything.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Everything?

ZAMMITO

Everything.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Boy, you must be pissed.

ZAMMITO

Well, you know, when five guys break

into my house in the middle of the night,

stick guns in my face, tie me up and

steal from me... it does irritate me.

43.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Well, I must say you're handling it very

well.

ZAMMITO

You know why I'm handling it very well?

Because you're going to get these guys

for me.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Okay boss.   Where are they?

ZAMMITO

If I knew where they were you wouldn't

have to find them, would you?

JOEY "TWO TONS"

You didn't say find them. You said,

"get them."

ZAMMITO

Just find them!

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Okay boss.

ZAMMITO

Papa Joey?

SOPHIE

Can't sleep?

SAMI

No.

SOPHIE

I'm sorry things went so wrong today.

SAMI

It's not your fault.

SOPHIE

What are you doing?

44.

SAMI

I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes.

See what's so important that a mob guy

has to lock it away in his safe.

SOPHIE

Sounds boring.

SAMI

It's three in the morning.    Not much

else to do.

SOPHIE

I can think of something.

WAYNE

She's not here, man.

SAMI

Where is she?

WAYNE

I think she went to do some laundry.

Threw some stuff in a bag and left.

SAMI

Bag?

SAMI

Get up.   We've been ripped off!

JULIEN

Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't

trust anyone these days.

45.

RAYMOND

She took everything!    Didn't even leave

us cab fare.

SAMI

Not everything.

SAMI

I was going to listen to it last night

but I --

SAMI

-- feel asleep.

WAYNE

No you didn't, dude. You were bangin'

Sophie. I saw you guys going at it.

DANIEL

You slept with her?

SAMI

Well, actually I would say she slept

with me.

SAMI

What's the big deal? It's not like I

was on guard duty or something.

DANIEL

You didn't think it was little suspicious

that someone you only knew for a few

hours wanted to sleep with you?

SAMI

No.   Chicks dig me.

MAN'S VOICE

Hello?

ZAMMITO'S VOICE

It's me. I need an answer from you if

I'm going to move.

46.

MAN'S VOICE

We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of

work' here. We're talking about a boss.

SAMI

Holy shit.

RAYMOND

What?

ZAMMITO'S VOICE

Bonanno's a dinosaur. Guy thinks he's

fuckin' Vito Corleone or something. The

old ways are gone. If we don't change

now we're going to get pushed out. I

need to know if I can count on your

support?

MAN'S VOICE

Yeah.

SAMI

No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk

out with this stuff. He's planning on

killing Bonanno and taking over the

family.

JULIEN

This wasn't the deal! The deal was to

steal a necklace, not get in the middle

of a Mafia war.

MARCEL

The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says

it is.

DANIEL

You know, if you could get your nose out

of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you

might see what's going on around you.

JULIEN

I knew this was a mistake! I knew it

last night when you asked me to go along

with this. I could hear that little

voice in my head saying, "don't do it!

Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I

ever listen to myself?

47.

SAMI

Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal

with that.

MARCEL

What are you guys so scared of? Zammito

doesn't know who we are. We just get

out of town and it's over.

ZERO

Oh, you think it's that easy?

RAYMOND

Yeah.   We just go home.

DANIEL

We can't.

RAYMOND

I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the

airport and get on a plane.

SAMI

They'll be waiting for us at the airport.

DANIEL

You steal some money from a man he gets

over it in time. But these tapes. He's

never going to stop looking for us.

SAMI

We have to find Sophie.

RAYMOND

How are we going to do that?

WAYNE

I know where she went.

WAYNE

I heard her talking on the phone. Bay

View Motel. It's about five blocks from

here.

48.

RAPHAEL

Tell me the truth Hector... do you think

we'll find my car?

HECTOR

Hard to say.

RAYMOND

How do we know what room she's in?

SAMI

Wait here.

SAMI

Hi. Did a woman just check in? She's

about five six. Pretty. Dark hair.

MOTEL CLERK

I can't give out information on our

guests.

SAMI

C'mon man, I think she's having an affair.

MOTEL CLERK

So are half the people in this place.    I

can't help you, pal.

MOTEL CLERK

Look, I can't tell you --

49.

MOTEL CLERK

Room fourteen.

ZERO

Thank you.

SAMI

I really thought we had something special

going. I can't tell you what a

disappointment you've turned out to be.

SOPHIE

After last night I could say the same

for you.

RAYMOND

The money isn't here.

SAMI

Where is it, Sophie?

SOPHIE

I don't know.

DANIEL

If you think because you're a women this

can't go hard on you, think again.

SAMI

Who are you waiting for?

SOPHIE

Stick around and find out.

50.

ZERO

He's FBI.

RAYMOND

What is she doing with an agent du FBI?

SAMI

We've been set up.

SAMI

We didn't go to the wrong house. We

went to right one, didn't we Sophie?

SAMI

They send us to Zammito's house. The

FBI is right across the street watching

the whole thing, but they don't move. A

crime is going down and they don't move.

Why?

(beat)

Because they were waiting for us to come

out so they could arrest us.

ZERO

What does arresting us get them?

SAMI

(to Hadley)

You wanna tell him?

AGENT HADLEY

You're telling it fine.

DANIEL

You see my friend over there? I nod to

him and he's going to put a bullet in

your knee.

AGENT HADLEY

You wouldn't.

51.

AGENT HADLEY

That's going to make a lot of noise.

Not much time for a conversation after

you pull the trigger.

SAMI

He's got a point.

AGENT HADLEY

Okay! Okay! We've been investigating

Zammito for years, but we've never had

enough evidence for a warrant to search

his house. We got word through a snitch

that Zammito was planning on taking

Bonanno out.

DANIEL

We know all this.

AGENT HADLEY

You just don't take out a boss. You

need permission from the other families

to do something like that. Our informant

told us that Zammito was talking with

other bosses and recording their

conversations in case they later claimed

they weren't involved. Look at these

tapes. The guy has recorded every

conversation he's had for years.

DANIEL

So we rob Zammito. You arrest us when

we come out and the contents of the safe

is now evidence which you can use against

him.

SAMI

(to Sophie)

What are you getting out of this?

SOPHIE

Money. It was supposed to simple.    In

and out.

(More)

52.

SOPHIE (Cont'd)

Zammito wasn't supposed to be there.

QUICK CUT TO:

ZAMMITO

Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives

will you explain to her I had an

emergency.

MARIO

Of course, Mr. Zammito.

SOPHIE

Hi.    I'm meeting Frankie Zammito --

CUT BACK TO:

SAMI

Why?

SOPHIE

Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.

DANIEL

For what?

SOPHIE

Laurant and Vincent were in business

with Zammito.

DANIEL

What kind of business?

SOPHIE

Black market art. Zammito got to a few

key security guards at the Metropolitan

Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the

artists to make copies of famous works.

They'd switch the paintings, send the

originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's

would sell them to private collectors.

53.

AGENT HADLEY

We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet.

We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's

"Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week

with a copy. It was on loan from the

London National Gallery and they're not

going to be very happy when they find

out about it.

SAMI

So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds

to trade up for his brother?

AGENT HADLEY

Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito.

If we got what we wanted we'd let his

brother go providing he tells us where

the Van Gogh and the other paintings

are.

RAYMOND

No one has mentioned the part of the

plan about us getting caught and going

to prison.

DANIEL

We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.

AGENT HADLEY

You walk out with that bag and you won't

only have Zammito and his people after

you. You'll have the entire United States

justice department. How far do you think

you'll get? I know who you are Mr. Foray?

Mr. Zerhouni. Mr. Gayet.

(looks at Zero)

Mr...

SOPHIE

Zero.   That's all I know.

AGENT HADLEY

You'll never get out of the city.

DANIEL

Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!

ZERO

You want Zero to kill him?

54.

DANIEL

I'm going to kill him myself!

ZERO

What about the money?

SAMI

It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't

have time to go anywhere else before she

came here.

ZERO

We don't know that for sure.

DANIEL

Forget the money! We've got bigger

problems than the money right now.

RAYMOND

She probably hid it at her place.    The

six of us could find it in --

SAMI

(overlapping)

-- We don't have time to look for it.

Hadley's first move is going to be to

look for us there.

DANIEL

We're moving. Pack up and be on the

street in five minutes.

AGENT HADLEY

This is turning to shit. If word gets

out of my involvement in this I'll go to

prison.

SOPHIE

Listen, we know their names. They don't

know the city. You'll find them. You're

the FBI.

AGENT HADLEY

I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If

I do the tapes become evidence.

SOPHIE

They're supposed to be evidence.    That's

why Bastaldi set this up.

55.

AGENT HADLEY

Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These

tapes are gold. Do you have any idea

what Zammito would pay to get them back?

SOPHIE

I thought you wanted Zammito?

AGENT HADLEY

What for? The minute I get him some

other Gavone will take his place. I've

been doing this for twenty years. When

I retire it's not going to be to some

trailer park in the suburbs.

AGENT HADLEY

Too many people know about my involvement

in this.

SOPHIE

Then we just have to make sure everyone

who knows can't say anything.

AGENT HADLEY

You're right about that.

RAYMOND

I would like to thank you for your

hospitality.

(hands him a card)

If you are ever in Paris here is my

number.

WAYNE

Cool.

DANIEL

(to the others)

I'll be right back.

56.

LAMAR

What do you want now?

DANIEL

Guns.   Can you get them?

LAMAR

Man, I can get anything.

DANIEL

Don't bullshit me.

LAMAR

I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns.

I can get any kind of gun you want. But

they ain't gonna help your sorry ass.

You ain't been in town one day and already

you got two of the toughest people in

Chicago looking for you. How is that

possible?

DANIEL

I've got a way with people.

LAMAR

I can see that. The man's car you stole.

Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th

Street gang and one crazy motherfucker.

And Frankie Zammito's got the word out

he's looking for some French dudes.

You're French ain't ya?

DANIEL

I'm from Belgium.

LAMAR

Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was

you. You know Zammito just put his own

brother in the hospital? Broke his arm

cause he was late on a debt. I mention

this to illustrate the kind of people

who are lookin' for you.

DANIEL

Why haven't you turned us in?

LAMAR

I ain't no rat.

(beat)

You got money, right?

LAMAR

And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you

a commission... kind of like a brokerage

fee.

57.

DANIEL

How much?

LAMAR

A thousand dollars?

DANIEL

Fine.

DANIEL

Take this. I'll call you in a few hours.

You tell me where we meet.

WAYNE

Yeah?

WAYNE

Hey dude, what do you think you're doing?

WAYNE

Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a

warrant or something?

AGENT HADLEY

Not today.   Where are your friends?

WAYNE

They left about a half hour ago.

AGENT HADLEY

Where did they go?

WAYNE

I dunno.

WAYNE

Hey man, you can't do that!

AGENT HADLEY

What?   This?

AGENT HADLEY

Or this?

58.

WAYNE

Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?

AGENT HADLEY

I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now,

if you don't want me to keep on hurting

you, it's important that I believe you

and right now I don't. So tell me, where

did they go?

WAYNE

I swear man, I don't know. They packed

up and left a half hour ago.

(points to coffee

table)

All I got is one of their phone numbers

in Paris.

MAID

Maid service.

RAYMOND

(in French)

I know Mama, but I couldn't call you

yesterday we were very busy.

(listens)

No, nothing's more important than you.

(listens)

I don't know. I think I'm going to have

to stay a few more days.

DANIEL

(to Marcel)

Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with

Zammito?

59.

MARCEL

No.

DANIEL

You're sure?

MARCEL

I think if he told me he was going to

steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase"

I would remember it.

SAMI

(correcting him)

"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."

MARCEL

Whatever! He never told me about the

Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.

SAMI

It makes sense. I mean, do you really

think he would come along if he knew we

were being set up?

DANIEL

I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi

told him to.

MARCEL

Fuck you! You know I'd never go along

with something like this.

DANIEL

Do I?

MARCEL

This ain't about that and you know it.

This is about you never forgiving me for

leaving the crew.

SAMI

(surprised)

You guys used to work together?

MARCEL

Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried

to do something to better myself.

DANIEL

(in French)

You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?

MARCEL

(in French)

Better than spending my life crawling

through windows in the middle of the

night.

60.

SAMI

All right, knock it off.

DANIEL

(in French)

All you are is a professional ass-kisser.

MARCEL

(in French)

I'm not a guy who is known for his

patience and right now you're testing

mine.

DANIEL

(in French)

What is that a threat? Are you fuckin'

threatening me, Marcel?

SAMI

I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm

concerned you two girls can bitch slap

yourselves silly when this is over, but

right now we've got to figure out what's

going on.

RAYMOND

It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up.

He's closing down his operation and this

is his way of saying thanks to all of

us.

JULIEN

Well, I say the whole deal is off. In

fact, if you ask me, there never was a

deal because we were screwed from the

start.

ZERO

Hey Sami, you're on TV.

REPORTER

... Sami Zerhouni in connection with the

murder of Sophie Nichols.

SAMI

What?

REPORTER

Police have confirmed that Zerhouni was

seen entering the woman's room by the

Motel Manager.

61.

REPORTER

Zerhouni is also wanted by police for

questioning regarding a robbery last

night at the home of alleged Mafia member

Frankie Zammito.

ZAMMITO

Oh, shit!

REPORTER

The other members of his gang are reported

to be French nationals Daniel Foray,

Marcel Burot, Julien Labesse...

LAMAR

Dumb crackers --

REPORTER

... Raymond Gayet and an unidentified

man only known as Zero.

AGENT HADLEY

That should shake things up.

62.

REPORTER

Up next.    A vacation get away on a budget --

SAMI

Hadley --

DANIEL

Has to be.

JULIEN

(freaking out)

This is bad. This is really fuckin'

bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad

this is?

SAMI

Hey, it's not your picture on the TV,

it's mine. So, try to be cool.

JULIEN

Don't tell me to be cool! We were

supposed to be in and out. In and out!

In the last twenty four hours we've

managed to get the Mafia... the FBI...

the Chicago Police Department and a group

of Latin gang members after us. I haven't

left out anyone, have I?

(pretends to think

about it)

I don't think so, because we've already

pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!

SAMI

We've got to get out of here.

JULIEN

That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?

SAMI

You're not helping.

RAYMOND

Julien, what you're doing right now is a

very normal psychological reaction to

stress. You're projecting your anger

onto us.

JULIEN

Oh, Jesus.    We're dead.

63.

LAMAR

Yeah?

DANIEL (V.O.)

It's me.

LAMAR

Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was

just watching the news and--

DANIEL (V.O.)

(overlapping)

-- Did you set it up?

LAMAR

Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten

o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on

River Street. Oh, and due to your recent

notoriety and the heat that comes with

it, I'm going to have to increase my

brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.

DANIEL (V.O.)

We had a deal.

LAMAR

We had a deal before you and your friends

became the new poster boys for crime.

DANIEL (V.O.)

Fine.     Ten o'clock.

DANIEL

Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from

someone who looks like one of us.

JULIEN

What for?

DANIEL

We need to rent a car and for that you

need a credit card.

RAYMOND

Why not just steal another one?

64.

DANIEL

Too risky. We don't need to get pulled

over because of a stolen car.

JULIEN

Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why

aren't we leaving town? Any place has

to be safer for us than Chicago.

SAMI

It doesn't matter where we go. Between

Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We

have to end this here.

ZERO

And how do we do that?

SAMI

I don't know.

JULIEN

That's an excellent plan.     Very

comforting.

DANIEL

We'll think of something.

BONANNO

Why didn't you tell me about this?

ZAMMITO

You have enough to worry about, Angelo.

You don't need my problems.

BONANNO

We're family.     An insult to you is an

insult to me.

BONANNO

They knew who you were when they broke

in your house?

ZAMMITO

Yes.

65.

BONANNO

What is happening with the world? There

was a time no civilian would touch a

made man. Now every babbo in the world

thinks he can get away with something.

What did they take?

ZAMMITO

Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I

can replace, but there's a cardboard

box... photos of my mother. They're the

only ones I have of her.

BONANNO

We're doing everything we can to find

these people. Right Tony?

HALF TOOTH TONY

We've reached out to everyone we know.

BONANNO

If they're still stupid enough to be in

this city, Tony will find them.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Frankie, come here a second.

NICKY "THE RAKE"

Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?

ZAMMITO

(impatiently)

Get in the car.

NICKY "THE RAKE"

Just tell me who's closer to the wall?

ZAMMITO

You are!   Now get in the fuckin' car!

66.

BLACK GUY

(very loud)

I'm gonna have to search you.

DANIEL

We'll save you the trouble.

BLACK GUY

(loudly)

You can't come in here with that.

DANIEL

What's wrong with this guy?

ELLWOOD

He's my cousin. He's deaf.

DANIEL

We're here to buy, not steal. If you

guys are straight there's not going to

be a problem.

ELLWOOD

Let them in.

67.

ELLWOOD

What can I do you for?

DANIEL

How much for the nines?

ELLWOOD

A grand a piece.

DANIEL

I'll need extra clips and ammo.

LAMAR

What the hell you doing, Ellwood?   I

gave them my word.

ELLWOOD

Zammito's offering twenty grand a head

for these guys. You think I'm going to

settle for four G's when I can make forty?

(to Daniel)

All right. Reach in easy and put the

gun on the floor.

ELLWOOD

I said put it on the floor, not kick it

under the bed.

ELLWOOD

Get that and add it to my inventory.

ELLWOOD

I assume you're carrying too?

68.

ELLWOOD

Okay, put it on the floor... and do not

kick it under the fuckin' bed.

ZERO

(flatly)

No.

ELLWOOD

No? Did you just say no? Listen cowboy,

if you're thinking about makin' a move,

don't. Nobody is that fast.

ZERO

Zero is.

ELLWOOD

Who's Zero?

LAMAR

He is.

BLACK GUY

Found it!

DANIEL

There's ten grand in here. It's yours.

I'm going to call you again. There's

one more thing I need you to do.

LAMAR

What?

DANIEL

I'll tell you when it's time.

69.

RAYMOND

(in French)

I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not

a good liar.

JULIEN

(in French)

Relax. It will be fine.

CAR RENTAL AGENT

Hello.

RAYMOND

Hello. I am Robert M. Carney from Dayton,

Ohio and I would like to rent a car with

my visa gold card.

CAR RENTAL AGENT

(into phone)

I got a couple French guys here trying

to rent a car.

(listens)

Sure. I can stall them.

ZAMMITO

Angie, how you doin'?

ZAMMITO

Hey, you're looking good. There's

something different about you. You get

a boob job or something?

ANGIE

I've gained weight.

ZAMMITO

Yeah, well, it suits you.

70.

ZAMMITO

Hey Tommy.

RICHIE

I'm Richie.    He's Tommy.

ZAMMITO

Whatever.

ZAMMITO

Angie, take the kids down to the gift

shop and buy 'em something. I need a

word with Vinny.

ANGIE

(flatly)

Gee, five bucks. What ever shall we

buy?

ZAMMITO

She seems pleasant enough.

VINNY

She doesn't know. She thinks I fell

down the stairs.

ZAMMITO

That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy

does.

ZAMMITO

So, I just come by to see how you're

doin'?

VINNY

You broke my arm. How the hell do you

think I'm doin'?

ZAMMITO

Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating

you all right? Food okay?

VINNY

Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do

you want, Frankie?

ZAMMITO

I don't want anything.

(More)

71.

ZAMMITO (Cont'd)

I just wanted to say... that I may have...

overreacted a little the other day.

VINNY

A little?

ZAMMITO

Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and...

well I should have found another way of

expressing my disappointment. So, I've

decided to make it up to you.

VINNY

You gonna forget about the money I owe

you?

ZAMMITO

What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I

was thinking I'd throw a little extra

work your way. You know, you come down

to the club, make espresso for the boys...

wash their cars... run some errands...

things like that.

ZAMMITO

(into phone)

Yeah?

(his face hardens)

I'm on my way.

ZAMMITO

I got something I gotta do. I'm glad we

had this talk. Heal. Get better. Let

me know when you're ready to start.

GANG MEMBER

I ain't seen it your car. Sorry man.

Hey, you know who you should talk to is

Freddy O.

RAPHAEL

I thought he was in prison.

GANG MEMBER

Got out last month. He's trying to go

straight but he's still wired in.

(More)

72.

GANG MEMBER (Cont'd)

He's working at some restaurant. I'll

find out where and call you.

AGENT HADLEY (V.O.)

Agent Hadley.

SAMI

Do you know who this is?

AGENT HADLEY (V.O.)

Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from

you.

SAMI

If you ever want to get those tapes,

meet me in one hour at Grant Park near

the statue.

CAR RENTAL AGENT

I'm sorry about the wait. There was a

problem with the equipment.

JULIEN

Everything okay now?

CAR RENTAL AGENT

Everything's fine.

ZAMMITO

I don't know the little one, but the

other guy is definitely one of them.

Follow them and call me when you find

out where they go.

73.

JULIEN

(in French)

I'll drive.

RAYMOND

(in French)

I'm the driver.

JULIEN

(in French)

I've never driven a Cadillac before.

JULIEN

(in French)

This is a car. I think this is the best

American car I've ever driven.

RAYMOND

(in French)

This is the only American car you've

ever driven.

SAMI

You set me up, you piece of shit!

SAMI

What are you doing?

AGENT HADLEY

You think I'm going to talk to you until

I know if you're wired.

SAMI

Wired?    I ain't wired.

74.

AGENT HADLEY

Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.

SAMI

You killed her!

AGENT HADLEY

No. You killed her. Manager remembers

you going into her room. Your

fingerprints were found all over the

place.

SAMI

Bullshit! She was alive when we left

her with you.

AGENT HADLEY

You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's

why you're here.

SAMI

Look, I just want out of this nightmare.

I don't know these guys. A few days ago

I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm

America's most wanted.

AGENT HADLEY

Where are the tapes?

SAMI

I can get them -- but what do I get if I

do?

AGENT HADLEY

A pass.

SAMI

A pass? How you gonna give me a pass?

A witness can put me at the crime scene.

AGENT HADLEY

Witness' can be convinced they made a

mistake. Without the murder weapon the

D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.

SAMI

They don't have a murder weapon?

AGENT HADLEY

No. I have it. The lamp? The one with

your fingerprints and her blood on it?

(holds up his burned

hand)

Remember?

75.

CUT TO:

CUT BACK TO:

AGENT HADLEY

Of course they could always get an

anonymous tip. Find it in the dumpster

behind the motel.

SAMI

You want the tapes for yourself.     You're

going to sell them.

AGENT HADLEY

I'm going to retire with a shit-load of

money. Find me a small country that

doesn't have an extradition treaty with

the States and live the good life.

SAMI

You didn't have to kill Sophie.

AGENT HADLEY

Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.

SAMI

What about me? Aren't I a loose end?

AGENT HADLEY

When this is over you can say whatever

the hell you want. I'll be long gone.

Besides, who's going to believe you?

You're just a two-bit crook.

SAMI

And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't

pretend to be something different than

what I am.

76.

AGENT HADLEY

When you've got the tapes call me on

this number. We'll make the exchange

and that'll be the end of it.

JULIEN

(in French)

We're being followed.

77.

RAYMOND

(in French)

I knew I should have driven.

JULIEN

(in French)

Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.

RAYMOND

(in French)

What are we going to --

78.

JULIEN

(in French)

When we get to the next corner jump out.

RAYMOND

(in French)

I'm not going to leave you.

JULIEN

(in French)

We both know I'm already dead.

JULIEN

(in French)

Go!

79.

DANIEL

Julien?

SAMI

It's not your fault, Daniel.

DANIEL

No?

DANIEL

We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's

house.

MARCEL

We all agreed to it. You had no way of

knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.

DANIEL

I just want to live long enough to get

back to Paris. Just long enough to kill

Bastaldi.

SAMI

I say we make him pay first. After that

you can do whatever you want to him.

RAYMOND

He's right. Do you have any idea what

Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers"

is worth?

80.

MARCEL

No.   How much?

RAYMOND

I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.

DANIEL

We still have to get out of here.

MARCEL

Maybe if we gave the tapes back --

ZERO

(strongly)

No.

ZERO

They killed our friend. It's personal

now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien

died for nothing. The tapes are the

key.

SAMI

He's right. The tapes give us leverage

with Bastaldi.

AGENT HADLEY

Hello? Mrs. Gayet? Do you speak English?

(listens)

You do. Great.

(listens)

Oh, you taught Raymond English. You did

a wonderful job. I'm sorry to call so

late but I'm supposed to meet Raymond --

(listens)

No, I didn't know he was a difficult

child. Mrs. Gayet, I'm calling because --

(listens)

No, I don't have any children of my own.

I'm supposed to meet Raymond tonight at

his hotel and I forgot what Hotel he is

at. I wondering if you --

(listens)

The Holiday Hotel. Room 912. Thank you

very much.

81.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

What'd you guys find?

UNIFORMED COP

Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln

are your... associates.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

And the other car?

UNIFORMED COP

Some French guy. At least that's what

his passport said. You know Joey, I

shouldn't be talking to you about this.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Are you forgetting who supplements your

income?

UNIFORMED COP

No. It's just that the French guy had a

gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is

a homicide. Are you guys involved in

this?

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Yeah. I'll come down and make a full

confession later. Right now, tell me

what else you found?

UNIFORMED COP

A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

What hotel?

UNIFORMED COP

The Holiday Hotel.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

What room number?

UNIFORMED COP

I don't know.     I didn't look.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

Go look.

82.

DANIEL

Okay. Airports, train stations, bus

station are out. We know they're

connected to the car rental agencies

because that's where they picked up

Raymond.

SAMI

Even if we get out of town and go to

another airport I'm sure the FBI and

Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.

MARCEL

How about Canada?

RAYMOND

What are we going to do, take a taxi?

SAMI

I'm going to get some cigarettes.

FREDDY O

I can't believe someone would have the

balls to rip off your ride.

RAPHAEL

When I find them they won't have them

for much longer.

FREDDY O

I'll ask around. If they try to move it

I can find out.

RAPHAEL

Thanks.

83.

AGENT HADLEY

I'd like to see the manager please.

HOTEL MANAGER

May I help you?

AGENT HADLEY

I'm looking for several French men who

checked in within the last twenty four

hours.

HOTEL MANAGER

They checked in last night.

AGENT HADLEY

I need you to take me to their room.

MAN

Excuse me.   I was here first.

MAN

Hey buddy, you just can't push in here.

SAMI

Go away.

MAN

I most certainly will not go--

OPERATOR'S VOICE

Operator.

84.

SAMI

(into phone)

Room 912.

DANIEL

(to Raymond)

Get that, will you?

RAYMOND

Why do I always have to answer the phone?

DANIEL

Because you're the closest.

RAYMOND

I'm not any closer than you are.

DANIEL

Why is everything an argument with you?

RAYMOND

I'm just setting my boundaries.

DANIEL

Hello?

SAMI (V.O.)

Get out of the room! You've got company

coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.

DANIEL

Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!

RAYMOND

Why do I have to pick up the tapes.

DANIEL

Jesus!

85.

AGENT HADLEY

You should go now.

LITTLE GIRL

(calling into her

room)

C'mon, Mommy.

86.

DANIEL

Let's go!

87.

DANIEL

The bullet went clean through.

RAPHAEL

I can't eat.

HECTOR

So, can I have your fries?

88.

DANIEL

(to Zero)

When we get back to Paris I'll take you

dancing.

DANIEL

Bring me the scissors.

ZERO

And the Vodka.

DANIEL

Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.

ZERO

And be careful when you get near the

top. Zero has a very long one.

SAMI

What's he joking around for?    He's been

shot.

DANIEL

He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.

SAMI

Anybody hungry?

DANIEL

What'd you get?

SAMI

Some bread and...

89.

SAMI

Cheese.

DANIEL

Cheese?   In a can?

SAMI

It's good.

MARCEL

God, I want to go home.

SAMI

Hey, you know you can't this in France.

DANIEL

Thank God.

DANIEL

(to Zero)

Ready?

ZAMMITO

What happened?

NICKY "THE RAKE"

They sort of got away.

ZAMMITO

I see. Well, get back out on the street

and find them before I "sort of" kill

you.

90.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

But we ain't had nothing to eat all day

boss.

ZAMMITO

Oh, I'm sorry.

ZAMMITO

Had enough?

ZAMMITO

Try to get this through that fat, stupid

fuckin' head of yours. If Half Tooth

Tony finds these guys before we do and

Bonanno knows what was in my safe we are

all dead.

ZAMMITO

Cafones!

ZAMMITO

You gonna bring that over here today, or

what?

RAYMOND

The new Beaujolais' come out in France

next week. You like wine?

SAMI

I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.

RAYMOND

J&B?

SAMI

Glenmorangie.

RAYMOND

Glenmorangie is very good.

91.

SAMI

But I'll have a glass of Beaujolais with

you when we get back.

DANIEL

I'll be back in an hour.

SAMI

What?

DANIEL

Can I trust you, Sami?

SAMI

Hey, who warned you that they were coming

up to the room?

DANIEL

If they had taken us by surprise they

would have gotten the tapes back. That

would have left us with nothing.

SAMI

No, that would have left me with nothing

because all of you would be dead.

DANIEL

You haven't answered my question.

SAMI

Does it really matter what I say?

DANIEL

I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm

trusting you to do the right thing today.

SAMI

I will.

DANIEL

You better.

HALF TOOTH TONY

Yeah?

92.

DANIEL

I would like to see Mr. Bonanno please.

HALF TOOTH TONY

Who the hell are you?

DANIEL

Tell him I'm the guy who robbed Frankie

Zammito.

HALF TOOTH TONY

(points to a door)

In there.

BONANNO

Either you are incredibly brave, or

incredibly stupid. Which one is it?

DANIEL

I guess we're going to find out.

BONANNO

You rob an associate of mine... a friend

and--

DANIEL

(overlapping)

Not such a good friend.   May I reach in

my pocket?

HALF TOOTH TONY

He's clean.

ZAMMITO'S VOICE

Of course. I need an answer from you if

I'm going to move.

MAN'S VOICE

We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of

work' here Frankie. We're talking about

a boss.

ZAMMITO'S VOICE

Bonanno's a dinosaur.

(More)

93.

ZAMMITO'S VOICE (Cont'd)

Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or

something. The old ways are gone. If

we don't change now we're going to get

pushed out. I need to know if I can

count on your support?

DANIEL

I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This

guy's an idiot. How he's lived this

long is a mystery.

BONANNO

(seething)

I don't think it will be a mystery much

longer.

DANIEL

He's recorded every conversation he's

had with you for years.

BONANNO

I assume you want something?

DANIEL

We've got a lot of people looking for

us. We'd just like to go home.

BONANNO

You want me to help you get out of the

country?

BONANNO

And for my help I would get what?

DANIEL

Half the tapes.

BONANNO

And the other half?

DANIEL

I'll destroy them when we get back to

Paris.

BONANNO

I only have your word for that.

DANIEL

I just want to get my people home. I

know who you are and what you could do

to me if I don't honor my word.

BONANNO

Where are you staying?

94.

BONANNO

I only ask so I can call you when the

arrangements are made.

DANIEL

How about if I call you?

SAMI

Same place.    One hour.

SAMI

What the fuck was all that about at the

hotel last night? I thought we had a

deal?

AGENT HADLEY

Hey, you're not exactly the most

trustworthy guy in the world. I took a

shot. It didn't work. Did you bring

the tapes?

SAMI

The lamp?

95.

AGENT HADLEY

Just a second. You must think I'm a

real moron.

ZAMMITO'S VOICE

I just came by to tell that "piece of

work" you asked for on Johnny Wicks --

It's done.

BONANNO'S VOICE

Good.   How'd he go?

ZAMMITO'S VOICE

Like the crying rat bastard that he was.

ZAMMITO'S VOICE

Angelo, we can't lean too hard on this

guy. He's a congressman.

BONANNO'S VOICE

I made Peter Dimiano a congressman. We

pay him each month to look after our

interests.

AGENT HADLEY

Here you go, sport.

LAMAR

I'll take the bag.

AGENT HADLEY

You don't think I see through this?     You

tell Sami he's dead.

AGENT HADLEY

You're making a big mistake.    I'm an FBI

agent.

96.

LAMAR'S BUDDIES

C'mon, man!   Let's get out of here.

SAMI

See, I told you that you could trust me.

LAMAR

Okay, we're square now, right?

DANIEL

There's just one more thing I need you

to do.

LAMAR

I'm listening.

DANIEL

(into phone)

Mr. Bonanno, I was wondering if you--

(listens)

That would be fine. Thank you.

RECEPTIONIST

This came for you.

97.

SAMI

Since we're such good pals I thought I'd

sneak you an advanced copy of my latest

work. I call it, "I am a scum-sucking

FBI agent".

SAMI

You want the tapes for yourself.     You're

going to sell them.

AGENT HADLEY

I'm going to retire with a shit-load of

money. Find me a small country that

doesn't have an extradition treaty with

the States and live the good life.

SAMI

You didn't have to kill Sophie.

AGENT HADLEY

Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.

SAMI

It's a little arty I know, but it has

great content, don't you think? You

were so busy looking for a wire you

probably didn't even think about a video

camera. It was on the statue. Anyway,

I've sent a copy of the whole tape to

the Chicago P.D. and the FBI. They'll

get it tomorrow. If I were you I'd take

the day off.

EDDIE

Hey boss, some guy named Hadley.     Says

he's got some tapes you want?

98.

ZAMMITO

Yeah?

(listens)

How much? Are you nuts?

(listens)

Okay. Okay. There's an old warehouse

on Merchant Street...

RAYMOND

Mr. Zammito?

VINNY

Uh huh.

RAYMOND

I represent a person who wishes to remain

anonymous, but is aware of your current

financial problems with your brother.

VINNY

I don't know what you're talking about.

RAYMOND

I understand. The person who sent me

wishes to help you.

VINNY

How?

RAYMOND

You see that car?

VINNY

Yeah.

RAYMOND

It's yours. A gift. A gift you could

give to your brother... or anyone you

owe money to as partial payment.

VINNY

No shit?

RAYMOND

The papers for the car will arrive

tomorrow.

99.

ZAMMITO

Those the tapes?

ZAMMITO

Watch the paint.

AGENT HADLEY

The money?

ZAMMITO

How'd you get these?

AGENT HADLEY

I got 'em.    That's all you need to know.

ZAMMITO

Just a second.

WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE

Danke Schoen, darling Danke Schoen.

Thank you for all the joy and pain...

WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE

Pictures show, second balcony, was the

place we'd meet...

100.

WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE

... second seat, go Dutch treat, you

were so sweet...

ZAMMITO

Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.

JOEY "TWO TONS"

(referring to cassette)

Good song though.

ZAMMITO

Great fuckin' song.

BONANNO

This plane will take you to Canada.

From there you can fly back to Paris.

DANIEL

Thank you.

BONANNO

You have something for me?

HALF TOOTH TONY

They're good, boss.

BONANNO

And the other half of the tapes?

DANIEL

You have my word. I'll destroy them.

ZAMMITO

What's this?

101.

VINNY

A car.

ZAMMITO

Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a

sewing machine. What the hell is it

doing here?

VINNY

It's for you.

ZAMMITO

For me? What am I going to do with a

piece of shit like this?

VINNY

I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be

worth something. Someone gave it to me.

C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good

here.

ZAMMITO

Okay.    Okay.

VINNY

I'll get you the papers tomorrow.

ZAMMITO

(yelling after him)

Hey, if you're well enough to be walking

around you're well enough to start working

here.

RAPHAEL

You lost?

LAMAR

Don't come off like a hard-on with me.

I'm about to make you a very happy man.

102.

RAPHAEL

Anybody know about that car outside?

ZAMMITO

Yeah.   It's mine.

RAPHAEL

No.   It's mine.

ZAMMITO

The hell it is.

RAPHAEL

I'm telling you that's my car!   And

someone's gonna pay for it!

ZAMMITO

And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn

your taco-eating ass around and get the

hell out of here.

RAPHAEL

Fuck you, grease-ball!

ZAMMITO

Fuck me?   Fuck you!

103.

JERRY VALE'S VOICE

My love, forgive me...

JERRY VALE'S VOICE

I didn't mean to have it end like this...

JERRY VALE'S VOICE

I didn't mean to have you fall in love,

in love with me...

JERRY VALE'S VOICE

My love, please kiss me...

JERRY VALE'S VOICE

Arrivederci amore kiss me...

104.

JERRY VALE'S VOICE

Remember when we part...

JERRY VALE'S VOICE

You'll have my heart...

JERRY VALE'S VOICE

I love you so...

MARCEL

He's looking around for us.

ZERO

Zero can't stay like this much longer.

His leg is hurting.

BASTALDI

Hello?

DANIEL (V.O.)

(in French)

It's Daniel.

BASTALDI

(in French)

Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has

been a big--

DANIEL (V.O.)

(overlapping; in French)

-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want

to see your brother out of jail do exactly

what I say. Bring one million euros to

your boat at six o'clock.

BASTALDI

(in French)

A million! I don't have that kind of

money.

DANIEL (V.O.)

(in French)

Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about

the Van Gogh.

BASTALDI

(In French)

I don't have it. That's why Vincent

went to Chicago. They arrested him before

he could bring it back.

DANIEL (V.O.)

(in French)

Well, you better get the money somehow.

Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't

we'll destroy the tapes.

106.

DANIEL (V.O.)

(in French)

Go back on deck. There's a small rowboat

in the water --

DANIEL

(in French)

Put the money in the rowboat and untie

it. The current will carry it down river.

When we see that the money is there I'll

call back and tell you where the tapes

are.

RAYMOND (V.O.)

We're in business.

DANIEL (V.O.)

(in French)

Go down into the main cabin.   The tapes

are in the wooden chest.

107.

DANIEL

This is for Julien.

BASTALDI

Oh, Merde!

SAMI

Did you have to use that much explosive?

DANIEL

I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.

DANIEL

You didn't check it?

108.

MARCEL

I'm sorry! I was caught up in the

excitement of the moment. I should have

checked. I made a mistake. I suppose

that none of you have ever made a mistake

before?

SAMI

This is great. After everything we've

been through we've got eight hundred

euros and an autographed baseball.

MARCEL

The baseball is mine.

SAMI

No! You can't have the baseball! You're

not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!

MARCEL

I'm the one who took it.   It's my

baseball!

ZERO

If you say baseball one more time Zero

will shoot you.

MARCEL

Raymond, don't you think they're over

reacting a little?

RAYMOND

No. I think they have a right to express

their anger with you in light of the

fact that you're...

(something in him

snaps)

A FUCKIN' MORON! HOW COULD YOU NOT CHECK

THE MONEY, YOU GOD DAMN STUPID SHIT-HEAD!

MARCEL

Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be

angry... but I'm the one who took the

ball and that makes it mine.

SAMI

No.

109.

MARCEL

Give it to me, Sami.

SAMI

No!

Perfect.
