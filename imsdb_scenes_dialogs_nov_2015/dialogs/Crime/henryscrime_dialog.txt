2.

HENRY

Smells good.

DEBBIE

Sit down.

HENRY

Wow. Thanks.

DEBBIE

How was your night?

HENRY

Good. How was yours?

DEBBIE

Good.

HENRY

This is great.

HENRY (CONT'D)

Your shift's at eight thirty?

HENRY (CONT'D)

You not eating?

DEBBIE

I already did.

HENRY

You okay?

3.

DEBBIE

Are you coming with me to Cindy and

Bill's on Saturday?

HENRY

Sure. What time?

DEBBIE

For the baby shower.

HENRY

Right.

DEBBIE

Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and

Bill's.

HENRY

What?

DEBBIE

I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come

here.

HENRY

Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime.

DEBBIE

Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us?

HENRY

You're talking about kids.

DEBBIE

Of course I am.

HENRY

Okay.

DEBBIE

'Okay' you want kids?

HENRY

I love kids.

4.

DEBBIE

Henry?

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Do you still love me?

HENRY

Of course I do.

DEBBIE

Because I know you did once.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

What happened, Henry?

EDDIE

Henry Torne.

HENRY

Eddie Vibes.

EDDIE

So how you doin', man?

HENRY

I'm okay. What's going on?

EDDIE

Listen, I got a man down here.

5.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Mind if we come in for a second?

DEBBIE

He's hot.

JOE

(holding it in)

I'm sorry.

DEBBIE

You better come with me.

EDDIE

Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels.

HENRY

Yeah.

EDDIE

So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got

league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's

our first baseman. And he's not exactly

game-ready as you can see...

HENRY

Yeah.

EDDIE

So, what do you say?

HENRY

What do I say what?

EDDIE

You feel like playing a little ball?

Filling in for Joe?

HENRY

It's November.

6.

EDDIE

Yeah. They keep the field in perfect

shape.

HENRY

Oh.

EDDIE

So what do you say?

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Henry?

EDDIE

Appreciate you driving, man.

HENRY

So where's this game?

EDDIE

Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes.

CUT TO :

EDDIE

Pull up right over here. We gotta grab

some beer money at that ATM.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Just hang tight. We'll be right back.

7.

BEHIND HIM

HENRY'S POV

FROM :

FRANK (O.S.)

You!

A GUN

FRANK (CONT'D)

Freeze!

DETECTIVE

Henry, we know this wasn't your deal.

8.

DETECTIVE (CONT'D)

All you have to do is give me those

names. And you can go home. It's that

simple.

DETECTIVE (CONT'D)

Come on. Why are you sticking up for

these people? They're not your friends.

You've got a wife. You've got a job...

don't you care?

(THEN)

All you have to do is say something.

JUDGE (V.O.)

...in light of the fact that this is a

first offence...

JUDGE

...the court sentences Henry Torne to

four years in prison for the crime of

Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery.

MAX (O.S.)

So. What're you in for?

9.

HENRY

Huh.

MAX

I said what are you in for?

HENRY

Bank robbery.

MAX

Good. Clean. Simple. I like it.

HENRY

But I didn't do it.

MAX

Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial

favorite. Identities are just constructs,

anyway. They're mistaken all the time.

MAX (CONT'D)

I'm Max.

HENRY

Henry.

MAX

Go on. Make yourself at home.

HENRY

So...what are you in for?

MAX

Life.

MAX (CONT'D)

Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

10.

MAX

Hurry up. We gotta go.

MAX (CONT'D)

Breakfast.

MAX

`Monday is whole wheat bun-day.'

MAX (CONT'D)

What are you thinking about?

HENRY

Nothing.

MAX

You're thinking something. Let me guess.

You're thinking, `How did I get here?'

MAX (CONT'D)

How do you think any of us got here?

HENRY

I'm not sure.

MAX

I'll tell you how. Because we committed

crimes. But we committed to the wrong

thing. You see that was our mistake. We

didn't fulfill our potential, we got

angry and we took it out on other people.

MAX (CONT'D)

See him?

11.

MAX (CONT'D)

Hector. He wanted to be a doctor. He

could've been, but he chose not to fulfil

his potential, he chose not to commit to

his dream. And now look at him.

(THEN)

Bad choices, see.

MAX (CONT'D)

By the way, I recommend the potatoes.

MAX

That's the real crime, Henry. Not

committing to your dream.

MAX (CONT'D)

So what's yours?

HENRY

My what?

MAX

Your dream.

HENRY

Not sure I ever had one.

MAX

Never had a dream? What kind of a life is

that?

HENRY

I don't know. A pretty good one?

MAX

Henry, you're in jail.

MAX

But here's the good news. We got all this

time to do. And time is a medium of

exchange. You can buy things with it.

(MORE)

12.

MAX (CONT'D)

Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And

in your case, you can figure out what

your dream is.

MAX (CONT'D)

Your dream is your truth is your destiny.

HENRY

I told you. I'm here by mistake.

MAX

There are no mistakes.

HENRY

What?

MAX

But you're going to have to fight for

that dream, Henry.

HENRY

I am.

MAX

You're at a crossroads now. There are

going to be tests!

HENRY

What tests?

MAX

This is your moment. Whatever you do now

defines you. Go get em!

13.

MAX

You did good, Henry.

HENRY

I don't feel good.

MAX

You're doing better than you feel.

MAX (CONT'D)

Go to sleep, Henry.

(BEAT)

Sleep is for the blessed.

FADE OUT :

DEBBIE

Hi.

HENRY

Hi. You look beautiful.

DEBBIE

Thank you. How are you doing?

HENRY

I'm okay. How about you?

DEBBIE

I'm good.

DEBBIE (CONT'D)

Listen, Henry. I have something I need to

talk to you about.

14.

HENRY

Okay.

DEBBIE

I fell in love.

HENRY

Oh.

DEBBIE

I just...I mean it just happened.

HENRY

Okay. Wow...

DEBBIE

I'm sorry, Henry.

HENRY

It's alright.

DEBBIE

You're not mad?

HENRY

No.

HENRY (CONT'D)

I want you to be happy.

DEBBIE

You too, Henry.

MAX

I ever tell you I was married?

15.

MAX (CONT'D)

I mean nearly. I had a lovely

correspondence going with Jocelyn

Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she

finally came on visitor's day she said I

was too short.

HENRY

Books and covers.

MAX

Right. Books and covers.

CUT TO:

MAX

Clean as a whistle.

FINK

(checking himself out)

Max, I think you missed your calling.

MAX

Thank you.

(THEN)

Who do we got next, Henry?

HENRY

Hector. You're up.

HECTOR

Hey, Max. When are you up for parole?

16.

MAX

October.

HECTOR

Show us what you did for the board last

time.

MAX

I'm working.

OTHER INMATES

Show us!

MAX

Leave me alone.

INMATES

Come on! Show us.

MAX

All right, so I'm sitting there, and the

head of the board asks me what I'm going

to do if they let me out this time. And,

so...

MAX (CONT'D)

I get this twitch! and then I give him my

answer: "I'm gonna break in your house, set

your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on

a naked rampage through your garden, dance

in the streets of your l'il hometown like a

crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming

through the ethereal sky like God's blackest

angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly

fireball!

MAX (CONT'D)

Oh, yeah. You don't want ME. You don't

want THIS. Not out THERE.

MAX (CONT'D)

Believe me, I'm not going anywhere.

17.

HECTOR

Hey, White Shadow. When's your review

coming up?

HENRY

Next month.

HECTOR

You gonna do the twitch like your cellie?

HENRY

Nope.

HECTOR

What, you don't like it around here?

MAX

Everyone knows Henry's innocent.

HECTOR

(TO HENRY)

The board don't like it when you deny the

crime.

HENRY

I didn't do the crime.

HECTOR

Hey, but you got the time...so you may as

well have done it.

MAX

I like it! `You got the time, so you may

as well have done the crime!'

MAX (CONT'D)

Now that's funny, Henry.

HENRY

Yeah, you're right.

HENRY

You know you never did tell me what your

dream was, Max.

18.

MAX

I'm living it.

HENRY

Really?

MAX

Sure! It's easier to live in here. You

don't have to do anything. You just show

up. In fact they even do that for you.

I'm living the life.

HENRY

This place is horrible, Max.

MAX

So why didn't you just say something?

HENRY

When?

MAX

Back then. When you had the chance. When

you were still innocent.

HENRY

I thought maybe this was my way out.

MAX

And was it?

HENRY

Yeah.

MAX

See. There are no mistakes.

MAX

You got everything, kid?

HENRY

Yeah.

19.

HENRY (CONT'D)

Maybe you should think about getting out

of here sometime. I'll buy you a cup of

coffee on the outside.

MAX

The only thing I've ever missed in twenty

three years is a hot bath. And that ain't

worth walking out of here for.

PRISON GUARD (O.S.)

Torne! Let's go!

MAX

Don't forget. Your dream is your myth is

your truth.

HENRY

I thought it was my dream is my truth is

my destiny.

MAX

Just testing.

HENRY

I'm going to miss you.

MAX

Yeah, well. I hope I never see you again.

HENRY

I'm still gonna miss you.

MAX

Get out of here, Henry.

20.

JOE

JOE

Henry. How you doing?

HENRY

Hey.

JOE

(CALLING OUT)

Debbie! Henry's here.

(TO HENRY)

Come on in. Make yourself at home.

HENRY

Thanks.

JOE

Don't mind me. I'm just getting set up

for my meeting. You want a beer?

HENRY

Sure.

JOE

(CALLING OUT)

Honey, do mind getting Henry a beer?

21.

DEBBIE

Hi.

HENRY

Hi.

DEBBIE

I think that's everything you wanted.

HENRY

Thanks.

HENRY (CONT'D)

Are you happy?

DEBBIE

I am, Henry.

HENRY

I'm glad.

DEBBIE

So what are you going to do now?

HENRY

I don't know yet.

JOE

Honey, they're starting to arrive.

DEBBIE

(TO HENRY)

We're having a meeting. It's his new

business.

22.

JOE

Hey, maybe you'd be interested, Henry.

You could become a distributor for Jin

Chi.

JOE (CONT'D)

It's Korean kitchenware. The future of

food storage. Plus, if you recruit

distributors, you get paid even more.

HENRY

You mean like a pyramid scheme?

JOE

No! God, no. It's a multi-layered

marketing paradigm.

(HENRY'S LOOK)

Anyway, why don't you give it some

thought?

JOE (CONT'D)

Henry.

HENRY

Yeah?

JOE

Listen, I just wanted to thank you. For

not giving up my name.

HENRY

I don't know your name.

JOE

Sure you do. It's Joe.

HENRY

Right. You're welcome Joe.

(TO DEB)

I'll see you Deb.

DEBBIE

Take care of yourself, Henry.

23.

NEIGHBOR

Henry! How are you?

HENRY

I'm good. How are you?

NEIGHBOR

Great. How was Greece?

HENRY

Greece?

NEIGHBOR

Debbie told us all about your trip.

HENRY

I was in prison.

NEIGHBOR

In Greece?

PRETTY BLOND

Take a chance on life, take a chance on

Buffalotto!

PAROLE OFFICER (O.S.)

(re: the coffee)

Is it okay?

HENRY

Good. Thank you.

PAROLE OFFICER (O.S.)

So what do you think?

HENRY

About what?

PAROLE OFFICER (O.S.)

About building your life from the ground up.

HENRY

Sure. Sounds good.

25.

HENRY

Thanks.

FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER

Seems like yesterday you walked through

that door.

HENRY

It does?

FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER

Henry, You've done your time. You are now

a free free man.

(THEN)

How does it feel?

HENRY

Good.

26.

FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER

So, What's next?

CUT TO :

JULIE

What are you doing? What the fuck are you

doing? Are you okay?

(into cell phone)

Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran

someone over. No, he looks okay.

27.

JULIE (CONT'D)

You idiot, you weren't even looking where

you were going! Are you okay?

HENRY

I think I'm okay.

JULIE

No. Stay on the ground.

FRANK

Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an

ambulance.

HENRY

No, don't.

(Starts to stand)

I think I'm okay.

FRANK

(RECOGNIZING HIM)

You!

HENRY

(RECOGNIZING HIM)

Yeah. Me.

JULIE

(to Frank, confused)

Is he alright?

FRANK

Are you alright?

HENRY

Yeah. Fine.

JULIE

He just walked right out into the street.

He came out of nowhere.

FRANK

I saw the whole thing. You were on the

phone. You weren't even paying attention.

JULIE

Yes. I was. I know how to drive.

28.

JULIE (CONT'D)

What are you doing? Get back on the

ground!

FRANK

Park your car. I'm going to take him into

that cafe.

FRANK (CONT'D)

They let you out, huh.

HENRY

Yeah.

FRANK

Let's get you a seat in here.

FRANK

Pierre! Une Verre d'eau.

HENRY

Thanks.

JULIE

Did you call an ambulance? I'm calling an

ambulance.

HENRY

It's okay. I really am fine.

FRANK

Yeah. He's alright for a guy who just got

run over.

(sucks his teeth)

Lucky I guess.

JULIE

I think we should call a doctor.

JULIE (CONT'D)

What? Are you okay?

29.

JULIE (CONT'D)

Hello, guy? Are you okay? Do you need a

doctor?

HENRY

No. You look familiar.

JULIE

What?

JULIE (CONT'D)

Oh. That.

HENRY

What?

JULIE

(SINGS)

'Take a chance on life, take a chance on

Buffa-lotto'?

HENRY

Oh, that's why.

JULIE

Well, I guess you seem to be okay.

HENRY

Yeah. I'm okay.

JULIE

Okay. So you're okay?

HENRY

Yeah.

JULIE

Great.

(THEN)

So I can go now?

HENRY

Sure.

JULIE

Bye.

(THEN)

And be more careful.

HENRY

Thanks.

30.

WAITRESS

Anything else I can get you?

HENRY

A bathroom?

31.

PRISON GUARD (V.O.)

Max! You've got a visitor.

MAX

MAX

I thought I told you I didn't want to see

your face again.

HENRY

Nice to see you too.

GUARD

No contact.

HENRY

I figured it out.

MAX

What?

HENRY

My destiny.

MAX

Good. What is it?

HENRY

The bank.

MAX

The bank is your destiny?

32.

HENRY

Yeah.

MAX

What bank?

HENRY

The one I didn't rob.

MAX

But you went to jail for it.

HENRY

Exactly.

MAX

What are you talking about Henry?

HENRY

I did the time, I may as well have done

the crime.

MAX

Ah, that. Time. Crime. Right.

(THEN)

I still don't get it.

HENRY

I need your help.

MAX

What for?

HENRY

(A WHISPER)

To rob the bank.

HENRY (CONT'D)

So what do you say?

MAX

I'm in Jail. That's what I say.

HENRY

You've got your review coming up --

MAX

-- So?

HENRY

So you can get of here. If you want to.

33.

MAX

No. It's not as simple as that.

HENRY

Yes, it is.

MAX

No, it's not.

HENRY

Yes. It is.

MAX

No, it's not.

HENRY

MAX --

MAX

I'm happy here. This is my home.

HENRY

This is not a home. This is a prison.

MAX

Whatever you want to call it, I'm happy

here.

HENRY

Max. You can't die in this place.

MAX

I can die wherever I want.

HENRY

You really want to die here?

MAX

What do you want, Henry?

HENRY

I'm asking for your help.

MAX

To rob that bank?!

HENRY

I've thought about it. It's the right thing.

(THEN)

For both of us.

MAX

Henry. I got cards.

34.

HENRY

MAX --

MAX

Great to see you, kid.

HENRY

Max!

CHEKHOV

OPENS NOVEMBER 23

PRODUCTION:

JULIE (O.S.)

(As Madame Ranevsky)

Is it really me sitting here? I want to

dance and clap my hands!

STAGE :

35.

JULIE

JULIE (CONT'D)

(as Madame Ranevsky)

I think I must be dreaming. God Knows I

love my country. I love it deeply. I

couldn't see out the train window I was

crying so much.

(SHE'S TEARFUL)

But...I must drink my coffee...thank you

Firs, thank you, you dear old man. I'm so

glad to find you still alive.

ARNOLD AS LOPHAKIN (O.S.)

Your brother Leonid Andreyevich says I'm

an upstart. A Money grubber!

(marching to and fro)

He can say whatever he likes. I don't

care a bit.

ARNOLD AS LOPHAKIN

(CONT'D)

I just want you to believe in me like the

old days. I just want your wonderful

tender eyes to look at me like they did

THEN --

DAREK

Stop! Stop!

DAREK (CONT'D)

Too small, too safe! Stop showing me your

`safe face' --

ARNOLD

-- But I was --

DAREK

Not you. You're doing the best you can.

You.

DAREK (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

JULIE

I'm...listening.

36.

DAREK

Listening? You look like you're hearing.

To hear is to be weak. To listen is to be

strong. To listen is an action.

DAREK (CONT'D)

What is that?

JULIE

An action. I'm listening. Is this what

you mean, Darek? Is this what you want?

DAREK

No, Djula.

JULIE

Then what do you want?

DAREK

I want you to be more. I want you to be

better than that.

DAREK (CONT'D)

Now go drink coffee. And don't think

about what I want, think about what you

want!

JULIE

Fine. I'll go drink coffee.

DAREK

I'll go drink coffee too! Let's all `go

drink coffee'.

(SHOUTS)

Ten minutes everyone!

(to his Eastern European

ASSISTANT)

Olga! Coffee. Coffee for everyone. We'll

all have coffee Djula! Every single one

of us! And think about what we want!

HENRY

JULIE

What are you doing here?

37.

JULIE (CONT'D)

Are you here to sue me?

HENRY

No.

JULIE

Then what are you doing here?

HENRY

I saw your picture outside. The door was

open. I came in.

HENRY

Is it always like that?

JULIE

What?

HENRY

(gesturing back to the

THEATRE)

That.

JULIE

You mean rehearsal?

HENRY

Yeah.

JULIE

It's a process.

HENRY

Looks complicated.

JULIE

It's all pain.

(THEN)

Chekhov, right?

HENRY

I thought you were listening.

HENRY (CONT'D)

I'm Henry by the way.

38.

JULIE

Julie.

PIERRE

Madame Julie!

JULIE

Coffee, Pierre.

JULIE (CONT'D)

You want one?

HENRY

Sure.

SHE SIGNALS :

JULIE

Two.

JULIE (CONT'D)

What?

JULIE (CONT'D)

So what do you think?

HENRY

Doesn't look like you.

JULIE

No, I meant the poster.

HENRY

Oh. It's funny.

JULIE

Actors on a tree is funny?

HENRY

Yeah.

39.

JULIE

That's the director's joke.

JULIE (CONT'D)

He's making a comment on the American

culture. Actors faces as falling fruit.

Birth, death, the consumption of the ID.

JULIE (CONT'D)

To him, the American dream has become the

world's nightmare. "You are the country

of apocalypse."

(THEN )

That's what he told us on the first day

of rehearsal, anyway.

HENRY

Oh.

JULIE

The irony is, he loves the American

dream. I mean that's why he's here,

right?

(WHISPERS)

But I know for a fact he hates himself

for loving it. It's always an inside job,

isn't it?

HENRY

Yeah. I guess.

JULIE

But the truth is I wasn't listening. I

was playing it safe.

(THEN)

He was right. The jerk. About that,

anyway...

JULIE (CONT'D)

You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's

last play. He was dying when he wrote it.

JULIE (CONT'D)

It's perfect.

HENRY

Why?

40.

JULIE (CONT'D

It's my last play too. Here in Buffalo.

HENRY

You're leaving?

JULIE

Right after we're done.

(THEN)

I'm glad you came by. Thanks for not

suing me. I'll see ya.

INMATE

(CALLING OUT)

Hey Barber, tomorrow lunch, right?

MAX

Right.

ANOTHER CONVICT

Give `em hell!

MAX

I always do, Felipe!

GUARD

Morning, Max. Here we are again.

MAX

How's your grandson?

GUARD

Just started first grade.

MAX

That's great. The socialization begins!

41.

GUARD

How many more of these you think you got

in you, Max?

MAX

As many as it takes.

HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER

Good afternoon, Mr. Saltzman. Take a

seat.

HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER

(CONT'D)

Mr. Saltzman. Could you please tell the

board why you believe we should grant you

parole?

HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER

(CONT'D)

(HALF AMUSED)

Come on, Mr. Saltzman, what have you got

for us this time?

HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER

(CONT'D)

(o.s.)

Mr. Saltzman?

MAX

Well...

42.

HENRY

HENRY

I knew you could do it.

MAX

Where's the car?

HENRY

I don't have a car.

MAX

You don't have a car? What's wrong with

you? You came to pick me up without a

car. That's not picking a person up.

HENRY

Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up.

MAX

I don't know about this. Maybe this is a

mistake.

MAX (CONT'D)

Dave! Carl!

HENRY

Max, it's okay. You're free.

MAX

Open up! DAVE!

HENRY

Come on, Max.

MAX

I don't like this.

HENRY

Take it easy. There's nothing to be

frightened of. I promise. You're okay.

The bus station's just a short walk.

43.

MAX

I can't breathe. I -- can't breathe...

HENRY

You're going to be alright.

MAX

(nearly on his knees)

I'm going to die right here. I told you!

HENRY

Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus.

HENRY

You hungry?

HENRY (CONT'D)

It's pastrami. On rye.

HENRY

Here we are.

HENRY (CONT'D)

That one's yours.

44.

MAX

Thanks.

HENRY

Anything else you need?

MAX

Yeah.

MAX

(reads the label)

Ah. The land of milk and honey.

MAX

What is this obsession with coffee,

Henry? When did that happen?

HENRY

I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give

people a lot of purpose.

MAX

Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was

eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my

God. That tunnel's probably not even

there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry?

45.

HENRY

It's a start.

MAX

A start? This was your plan? An old

cartoon in a pissoir?

HENRY

It's an article.

MAX

Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in

with guns and do it the old-fashioned

way?

HENRY

No. No guns.

MAX

What?

HENRY

Someone could get hurt.

MAX

That's sweet, kid.

HENRY

(the tunnel photo)

Maybe it's still there, Max.

MAX

(SURE)

Uh-huh.

HENRY

Maybe it is.

MAX

Right. Okay. Yes. First things first. Why

don't we go take a look at this bank of

yours?

(THEN)

At least we know that's still there.

46.

MAX

Money is a mistress with a hard heart.

MAX (CONT'D)

I'd like to speak to your manager please.

I'm interested in opening an account.

CUT TO :

MR. TUTTLE (O.S.)

And which kind of account would you like

to open?

MAX

What kind do you have?

MR. TUTTLE

Savings. Interest only. Commercial --

MAX

(INTERRUPTING)

You know my uncle put all his money in

that vault when I was a kid, after we

came from Europe, before the war...the

Brownshirts. He said that vault will be

there for three hundred years!

MR. TUTTLE

We hope he's right!

MAX

He was never wrong. How long's it been

there already Mr. Tuttle?

MR. TUTTLE

Since 1891.

MAX

And in the very same spot, correct?

MR. TUTTLE

That's right. On the very same spot.

47.

MAX.

(TO HENRY)

See, my boy!. History. It's all about

history.

MR. TUTTLE

Now. As I was saying. We have savings.

Interest only. Commercial --

MAX

(INTERRUPTING)

You'll have to give us some time to think

about which one.

MAX (CONT'D)

Thank you. You've been very helpful.

MR. TUTTLE

(CONFUSED)

No. Thank you.

FRANK

Have a nice day, gentlemen.

HENRY

The vault is here.

HENRY (CONT'D)

The tunnel runs under here...

HENRY (CONT'D)

And ends up somewhere in there.

MAX

It's virtually robbing itself!

JULIE

Jesus...goddamn! Goddamn Czech Chekhov

shit!

48.

JULIE (CONT'D)

AHHHH!!

HENRY

(rubbing his head)

Hi.

JULIE

Jesus. Henry?

HENRY

Julie, Max. Max, Julie.

MAX

Hiya.

JULIE

What are you doing here?

HENRY

Oh, we were, you know --

MAX

I was just showing Henry the place I used

to perform.

JULIE

Oh. What?

SIMON

That's lunch, Julie.

JULIE

Thank God.

MAX

Chekov's tough stuff. It takes a steel

stomach.

JULIE

You know Chekhov?

MAX

Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my

favorite Russian.

49.

MAX (CONT'D)

Would you mind if we took a look around?

It's been over thirty years since I've

been inside.

JULIE

Sure.

JULIE (CONT'D)

Sure. Yeah. Come on in.

MAX

Thank you.

HENRY

How you doing?

JULIE

Great. I'm in hell.

MAX

Home again.

JULIE

So what productions were you in?

MAX

Oh. Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the

greats.

(A SMILE)

And the not-so-greats!

SIMON

(TO JULIE)

Mary wants to fit your wig at four. Darek

says to stay hungry.

JULIE

Fuck him.

SIMON

Got it.

50.

MAX

Would it be a tremendous imposition to

have a little tour for old time's sake?

JULIE

He used to perform here.

SIMON

I don't see why not. We're on a break.

MAX

That okay, Henry?

HENRY

Sure. Go ahead.

JULIE

Is that your dad?

HENRY

No. He's a friend.

JULIE

He seems like your dad.

HENRY

It's peaceful out here.

HENRY (CONT'D)

Is it fun?

JULIE

What?

HENRY

Pretending to be other people.

JULIE

It's not really like that. I don't

pretend to be someone else. I find some

part of me, and reveal it in a new

way...just inside of a character.

HENRY

So, in a way, you're still playing `you'.

JULIE

Yes. Exactly. In a way.

51.

HENRY

So what part of `you' are you playing

now?

JULIE

That's the question you always have to

ask yourself.

MAX

Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before

the magic! I remember it like it was

yesterday.

ARNOLD

People often make the mistake in Chekhov

of going down...but you must always

always go up...

MAX

Simon, did you know there used to be a

speakeasy down here during prohibition

days?

SIMON

Yes. And they hid the booze in the bank!

MAX

I know.

SIMON

And there was a tunnel too!

MAX

I know!

(THEN)

I forget. Where was it?

52.

JULIE

So what's your story, Henry?

HENRY

My story?

JULIE

I mean, like...what do you do?

HENRY

I'm figuring that out.

JULIE

Does that mean you don't have a job?

HENRY

I just got out of jail.

JULIE

Jail!

HENRY

Sounds worse than it is.

JULIE

Really? Jail sounds bad.

(THEN)

Why were you in there?

JULIE (CONT'D)

Are you a murderer or something?

HENRY

No. Do I look like one?

JULIE

No.

53.

HENRY

What do I look like?

JULIE

I don't know. A criminal.

HENRY

I do?

JULIE

Yeah.

SIMON

We got to be quick. Arnold doesn't like

people in his dressing room.

SIMON

(ENTHUSIASTICALLY)

It was right here.

MAX

Booze, broads and lucre. The good old

days. I like it.

SIMON

They filled it in, in 1931 when they

built the theatre.

SIMON (CONT'D)

Times have changed.

54.

MAX

All good things must come to...

(he hits a hollow spot)

...an end.

MAX (CONT'D)

Do you need volunteers?

HENRY

The Cherry Orchard.

(leafing through it)

So what happens? What's it about? Is it

funny?

JULIE

A woman returns to her family estate in

the Russian countryside and realizes she

has no choice but to sell her beloved

Cherry Orchard, the magical place of her

youth, the only place she ever felt safe.

HENRY

I guess it's not funny.

JULIE

It's about being forced to let go of the

past and create a new life in order to

survive.

MAX (O.S.)

That was great! This place is full of

treasures.

MAX (CONT'D)

Thank you, Julie. And thank you, Simon.

I'll see you tomorrow.

JULIE

Tomorrow?

SIMON

Max has very kindly offered to volunteer

at the theatre!

55.

JULIE

Oh.

MAX

Henry, let's get out of these people's way!

HENRY

(TO JULIE)

What are you doing after rehearsal?

JULIE

Why?

HENRY

Do you like Chinese?

JULIE

Yeah.

HENRY

Golden Dragon?

JULIE

It's okay.

HENRY

Eight o'clock?

SHE DECIDES :

JULIE

Sure.

DAREK

Work. Work! It's time to work Americans!

(SEES HER)

Even you Djula...

MAX

Let's go.

HENRY

See you, Julie.

JULIE

Stay out of jail.

56.

MAX

You were right, Henry. You got a nose

like a bloodhound!

HENRY

You found it?

MAX

Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing

room.

HENRY

Who?

MAX

Lophakin. We find a way to get into his

dressing room and we're right as rain!

MAX

I can see it, Henry. It's all in front of

me. The vault. The bank. The tunnel. The

pieces of the puzzle are on the table.

All we got to do is put them in the right

order!

(THEN)

The only thing is the dirt...where does

the dirt from the tunnel go?

HENRY

What about the vault?

MAX

First things first. I'm on the dirt.

HENRY

Okay. How do I look?

MAX

Like Henry.

(THEN)

We had a good day, Kid. It's good to be

back in the soup.

(MORE)

57.

MAX (CONT'D)

(he starts to take off his

CLOTHES)

Go have a nice supper.

A CHOPSTICK

JULIE

Sorry I'm late. I'm starving.

GUY

Julie.

JULIE

Bruce.

JULIE (CONT'D)

That guy's a total dick. Hi, Henry.

HENRY

Hi. How was rehearsal?

JULIE

I feel like duck.

JULIE

I don't just want to be good, I want to

be great. And I don't just want to be

great in Buffalo.

HENRY

Where then?

JULIE

Don't laugh.

(THEN)

Hollywood.

58.

HENRY

I guess that's where people go.

JULIE

I don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto

commercial. And it's not going to be.

Soon as this thing is done I'm out of

here.

(THEN)

Before it's too late.

HENRY

Sounds like a plan.

JULIE

I hate fortune cookies.

HENRY

We going anywhere in particular?

JULIE

(hits the joint)

Want some?

CUT TO :

JULIE (CONT'D)

You know there's a whole bunch of bodies

down there churning around. Just caught

in the current.

(BEAT)

They all took the risk and look what

happened to them. Same in death as they

were in life. Imagine that. You kill

yourself and nothing changes.

59.

JULIE (CONT'D)

All those dreams churning around down

there. It makes you sick.

(THEN)

I got to get out of here.

HENRY

I get it.

JULIE

So what did you do before jail, Henry?

HENRY

I worked at a toll booth.

JULIE

Which one?

HENRY

Rainbow bridge.

JULIE

No!

HENRY

Yes.

JULIE

I had family that used to live on the

other side. I took that bridge all the

time. We must of met a hundred times!

JULIE (CONT'D)

Wow. So you were one of the guys in the

tollbooth with those weird rubber gloves?

HENRY

Yeah.

HENRY (CONT'D)

What's so funny?

JULIE

You were watching everyone go somewhere

and you were going nowhere.

HENRY

That's funny?

JULIE

Yeah. Funny sad, not funny funny.

60.

HENRY

I worked nights. It gave me time to

think.

JULIE

About what?

HENRY

About where I wasn't going.

JULIE

See, that's funny.

(THEN)

What about now? Where you going now?

HENRY

I'm working on it.

JULIE

What'd they send you to jail for Henry?

HENRY

For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank.

JULIE

What!

HENRY

I thought I was on my way to a softball

game. It was a mistake.

JULIE

Sounds like it.

HENRY

But now I'm going to rob it for real.

JULIE

You're going to rob the bank you already

went to jail for robbing?

HENRY

Yeah.

JULIE

Ha!

HENRY

There's a tunnel.

JULIE

What tunnel?

HENRY

Runs from the bank to the theatre.

61.

JULIE

My theatre?

HENRY

Yeah.

JULIE

Ha!

JULIE (CONT'D)

You're fucking hilarious, Henry.

HENRY

(SERIOUSLY)

Thank you.

JULIE

You know what?

HENRY

What?

JULIE

I'm hungry.

HENRY

What for?

JULIE

(as the thought occurs)

Ice cream.

JULIE

I can't believe I'm sitting here.

HENRY

Neither can I.

JULIE

I want to dance and clap my hands.

62.

JULIE (CONT'D)

I think I must be dreaming!

JULIE (CONT'D)

God knows I love my country. I love it

deeply.

JULIE (CONT'D)

I couldn't see out the train window I was

crying so much.

JULIE (CONT'D)

Page twenty one.

JULIE (CONT'D)

I couldn't see out the train window I was

crying so much. But I must drink my

coffee.

(THEN)

Read Lophakin.

HENRY

`I have to go to Kharkov on the five

o'clock train. Such a bother, I wanted to

stay and look at you and talk to you.

(TO HER)

You're as wonderful as ever....'

JULIE

Read the next line!

HENRY

`Even more beautiful, and dressed like a

Parisian...you could blow me down.'

JULIE

Say it like you feel it. Like it's real.

Say it to me.

63.

`HENRY

Even more beautiful, and dressed like a

Parisian...you could blow me down.'

JULIE

You're good. Keep reading! And get up.

Walk around!

HENRY

`Your brother says I'm an upstart, a

money-grubber.'

JULIE

Yes, you are. You're a bank robber,

Henry!

HENRY

(the text again)

`I don't care a bit. I just want you to

believe in me like the old days!'

JULIE

(pulling him around the room)

Don't stop --

HENRY

`I just want your wonderful tender eyes

to look at me like they did then.'

JULIE

Again!

HENRY

`I just want your wonderful tender eyes

to look at me like they did then.'

JULIE

I'm glad I ran you over.

HENRY

Me too.

64.

JULIE

(SOFTLY)

Good morning.

HENRY

Good morning.

HENRY (CONT'D)

Good morning.

MAX

Henry!

HENRY (O.S.)

Max.

MAX

(pulling up his boxers)

I figured it out! Once we're in that

dressing room the dirt from the tunnel

goes out through the roof!

HENRY

MAX --

MAX

(rushing out into the front

ROOM)

That bank doesn't stand a chance.

MAX (CONT'D)

Ah. Company.

JULIE

Good morning, Max.

65.

HENRY

It's alright. She knows.

MAX

She does?

JULIE

I didn't know the dirt from the tunnel

goes out through the roof.

HENRY

We brought breakfast. How do you like

your eggs?

JULIE

It's okay. I'm not going to tell anyone.

MAX

Hold on.

MAX

You told her?

(A WHISPER)

About what we're doing?

HENRY

Yeah. I did.

MAX

It's a crime. You're supposed to keep

crimes a secret.

HENRY

It's okay, Max.

MAX

No. It's not kosher.

HENRY

How do you like your bacon?

66.

MAX

(PISSED)

Crispy.

MAX (CONT'D)

Okay. I'll get dressed.

JULIE

So what were you in prison for, Max?

MAX

I'm a confidence man.

JULIE

You mean a `con' man?

MAX

I never liked that word. It's only half

of what it is. The word confidence comes

from the latin. Fides. With Faith.

Belief.

(THEN)

That's what I'm about.

JULIE

You mean you make people feel good...and

then you rip them off?

MAX

Yes.

MAX (CONT'D)

But I was always much better at the

feeling good part than the ripping off

part.

(THEN)

Hence, the prison.

JULIE

Aren't you guys worried about getting

caught?

67.

MAX

Not really. For me it's a win-win

situation.

JULIE

How?

MAX

I like jail. Three hots and a cot.

JULIE

You too, Henry? You like jail?

HENRY

No. I like it out here.

JULIE

So why would you take the risk? Is it the

money?

JULIE (CONT'D)

It must be the money.

JULIE (CONT'D)

You are a criminal. A greedy little

criminal.

HENRY

(washing the plates)

`Your brother Leonid says I'm an upstart,

a money grubber...

(THEN)

...but I don't care a bit'.

HENRY (CONT'D)

`I just want you to believe in me like

the old days.'

JULIE

You remember!

MAX

What is that?

JULIE

It's Chekhov!

MAX

Chekhov?!

68.

HENRY

We read it last night.

JULIE

(TO HENRY)

You really are good.

(TO MAX)

He's a natural.

MAX

I thought you were on a date.

HENRY

We were.

MAX

Reading Chekhov's a date?

HENRY

Yeah.

JULIE

I got to get to the theatre --

MAX

Can you give me a ride there?

JULIE

Why?

MAX

I'm a volunteer!

JULIE

You weren't in any of those plays, were you?

MAX

No.

(THEN)

But can you give me a ride?

JULIE

All white! All White! Oh, my Cherry

Orchard. After the dark, stormy autumn

and the winter frosts you are young again

and full of happiness; the heavenly

angels have never abandoned you...

(MORE)

69.

JULIE (CONT'D)

Oh, if only I could be free of the stone

that weighs me down! If only I could

forget my past!

REVEAL HENRY

GAYEV

Yes and now the orchard will be sold to

pay our debts, which seems impossible...

JULIE

Look! It's mamma walking in the

orchard...in a white dress!

(laughing with joy)

There she is.

GAYEV

Where?

VARYA

Momma, don't!

MAX

This is driving me crazy.

HENRY

What?

MAX

We could be digging right now!

HENRY

We could?

MAX

If we were in that dressing room.

HENRY

It's rehearsal. There are people

everywhere.

MAX

This is pissing me off.

70.

HENRY

What?

MAX

I got an idea.

HENRY

What?

MAX

You have to be Lophakin!

HENRY

What?

MAX

If you did we'd be able to get into that

tunnel whenever we want.

HENRY

I'm not an actor.

MAX

You're not a bank robber either! And

you're doing that.

HENRY

Max. Come on.

MAX

She said you were a natural. That means

you can do it.

HENRY

No, it doesn't.

MAX

Yes, it does Henry.

(SHAKES HIM)

You ARE Lophakin! A man who came from

nothing. A man who's not afraid to create

a new life.

(POINTS)

A man who's in love with her!

MAX (CONT'D)

Your dream is your truth is your destiny!

HENRY

I can't be Lophakin. They have a

Lophakin.

71.

MAX

What if they didn't?

HENRY

There has to be another way.

MAX

Kid, You forced me out of jail to help

you. And I'm going to goddamn help you.

But you got to help me help you. Now I

need to know...

(a fierce stare)

...do you want this bank or not?

HENRY

Yes. I want it.

HENRY (CONT'D)

Then you're gonna be Lophakin!

CUT TO :

ARNOLD

ARNOLD

Good morning, everyone!

72.

ARNOLD

You knew this day would come. You deserve

this, lubya.

DAREK

Unprofessional shit!

ARNOLD

Mr. Millodragovich --

DAREK

(HISSING)

Shit!

MAX

What's happening?

JULIE

Arnold's leaving the production.

MAX

Oh. Gosh.

ARNOLD'S FACE :

ARNOLD

But I have no choice it's Willie Lohman

we're talking about!

(brandishing the letter)

A Ken Waterstone production!

DAREK

OOOH-LA-LA! A Ken Waterstone production.

The heaven's have opened. You lucky boy.

(MORE)

73.

DAREK (CONT'D)

Run, run, to that pandering, populist,

piece-of-shit-Waterstone and his

spineless productions! You're perfect for

it.

ARNOLD

Good-bye, Darek.

(THEN)

I'm sorry.

DAREK

Simone! I need a new Lopakhin. Now.

(CALLING OUT)

I'm dying, Olga! Cigarettes! Cigarettes

NOW! And COFFEE!

SIMON

We'll hold auditions this afternoon,

Darek! I'll get the list --

DAREK

I've seen that shit-list! It's a

disaster.

SIMON

What do we do?

DAREK

I must think.

DAREK (CONT'D)

Djula! Your orchard cannot be felled

before she has a chance to grow.

JULIE

Perfect.

MAX

(A SHRUG)

It is Ken Waterstone.

74.

JULIE

Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but

that's what's happening...

(SHE LISTENS)

I don't know, he's `thinking'...

JULIE (CONT'D)

What?

JULIE (CONT'D)

Sorry, I can't give you a ride --

MAX

You said he was a natural.

JULIE

Stan. Let me call you back.

(she hangs up, to Max)

What?

MAX

Henry.

JULIE

Henry what?

MAX

Henry would be perfect for it.

JULIE

Perfect for what?

MAX

For Lophakin.

JULIE

You mean Henry should play Lophakin?

MAX

Yes.

JULIE

He's not even an actor!

MAX

Exactly. He'd be playing himself.

(off her shocked look)

Think about it Julie! He is Lophakin.

(MORE)

75.

MAX (CONT'D)

A man who came from nothing. A man who's

not afraid to create a new life and put

his past behind him. A man who's in love

with you...Madame Ranevsky.

JULIE

Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly

shifting under my feet?

MAX

Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin

needs a dressing room.

(BEAT)

Can you get him in to see Darek?

JULIE

What's going on here, Max? What are you

doing?

MAX

Nothing.

JULIE

You made this happen, didn't you?

MAX

Sometimes a good guy needs a less good

guy to help the good guy be good.

MAX (CONT'D)

Fair enough.

JULIE

What am I supposed to do now?

MAX

He just needs a shot. One audition. Let

the chips fall where they may.

JULIE

What if it doesn't work?

MAX

They'll get someone else.

76.

MAX (CONT'D)

Give him a shot. One shot. That's all I'm

asking, Julie.

JULIE

Okay, confidence man.

DAREK

DAREK

...you've never had any training...you've

never been in a production...you don't

even know the play...

HENRY

I read it. I think I know the scene.

DAREK

Think.

DAREK (CONT'D)

Start.

HENRY

(READING)

`Your brother , Leonid Andrevich...'

DAREK

How can you perform Chekhov and not be

able to say AND-REY-E-VICH! Now say it!

HENRY

ANDREYEVICH.

HENRY (CONT'D)

Your brother, Leonid ANDREYEVICH says I'm

an upstart, a money grubber --

DAREK

A what?

HENRY

A money-grubber!

77.

DAREK

Are you?

HENRY

NO!

DAREK

Convince her.

HENRY

Your brother, Leonid Andreyevich says I'm

an upstart, a money grubber. He can say

whatever he likes. I don't care a bit --

DAREK

(into his ear)

NEITHER DO I.

HENRY

I just want you to believe in me like in

the old days.

JULIE WHISPERS :

JULIE

Show me, tell me.

HENRY

Good God in Heaven. My father was one of

your father's serfs, and your

grandfather's serf before that.

But you, you did so much for me in the

old days that I've forgotten all that...

HENRY (CONT'D)

I love you...like a sister...more than a

sister.

DAREK

You piece of shit! Yes!

DAREK (CONT'D)

Good.

78.

HENRY

Good?

DAREK

Yes.

DAREK (CONT'D)

Tomorrow. Be more good.

JULIE

Does this make me an accessory?

HENRY

I think so.

JULIE

Things have certainly gotten a lot more

interesting since you showed up.

HENRY

You mean since you ran me over...

JULIE

So why are you robbing the bank, Henry?

79.

JULIE (CONT'D)

It's not just about the money, is it?

HENRY

No.

JULIE

So why are you doing it?

HENRY

I used to sit in that toll booth and

think about just getting in one of those

cars, going wherever they went. Just

joining someone else's life.

JULIE

You were asleep at the wheel.

HENRY

Yeah, I was.

(THEN)

It was easier for me to go to jail than

tell my wife the truth.

JULIE

Which was?

HENRY

That I was going along with everything. I

didn't know I could change it.

(THEN)

So now I'm changing it.

JULIE

Robbing the bank is changing it?

HENRY

It already has.

JULIE

What was your wife like?

HENRY

Nice.

HENRY (CONT'D)

Are you sure you're okay with this? I

know it's a lot.

80.

JULIE

Not for a girl like me, Henry.

DAREK

This is Mr. Henry Smith. He will be

taking over the role of Lophakin. If you

please.

IT:

HENRY

Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward.

DAREK

Top of act three. Twenty minutes. Olga,

cigarettes!

REVEALING :

81.

MAX

Tracks! Trolley tracks!

HENRY

There's still twenty feet to go.

HENRY (CONT'D)

We're going to need another pair of

hands.

LOUD VOICE (0.S.)

No! No! NO! You got to be kidding me! You

suck! You SUCK! Could you possibly SUCK

anymore?

HENRY

That's him.

MAX

That's him?

82.

HENRY

Thanks for meeting us.

JOE

Sure.

HENRY

How's your pyramid scheme?

JOE

It wasn't a pyramid scheme.

HENRY

Okay.

JOE

It all fell apart.

(THEN)

We were banking on that money, Henry. And

now all I've got is a garage full of dumb

Korean plastic.

MAX

What's he talking about?

HENRY

Kitchenware.

MAX

Oh.

JOE

See what happens when a person tries to

go `legit'?

(THEN)

It's killing me.

HENRY

So how's Debbie?

JOE

She's worried, Henry. The baby's due in a

couple months.

HENRY

She's pregnant?

JOE

Yeah, she's pregnant.

83.

HENRY

Congratulations.

JOE

Thanks, Henry.

(THEN)

It's okay if you want to punch me out.

Tonight would be a good night. In fact I

could use it.

HENRY

Come on. This is great news.

(off Joe's hopeless look)

It's going to be okay.

JOE

Really? It is? You know how much diapers

cost? You know how much it costs to send

a kid to college?

MAX

You want to send your baby to college?

JOE

Of course not. I'm just saying. The kid

needs stuff. Stuff that's expensive.

Stuff it deserves.

(THEN)

These things are hot! I'm on fire.

HENRY

Listen, Joe, maybe we can help.

JOE

(WIPING OFF)

How?

HENRY

We might have a job for you.

JOE

No foolin'?

84.

HENRY

There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom

of that vault.

JOE

That's a lot of dirt, Henry.

HENRY

So what do you think?

JOE

I think we should get some guns and go

get the money through the front door!

HENRY

No guns. People could get hurt.

JOE

What about fake ones?

HENRY

They're still guns.

MAX

Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and

we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers

and tears and chump change. We're doing

an old fashioned heist. We're going right

into the belly of the beast.

(THEN)

Are you in or are you in?

ON JOE

JOE

I hope we don't get caught.

JULIE

I hate that commercial.

HENRY

I like it.

85.

JULIE

So what's your plan?

HENRY

For what?

JULIE

For when it's done. After.

(making light of it)

Am I going to see your picture in the

post office or something?

HENRY

I hope not.

JULIE

But have you thought about what happens

after?

HENRY

Not really, no.

HENRY (CONT'D)

I don't know. Maybe I could meet you out

west...

JULIE

Out west?

HENRY

Yeah. Maybe you could meet me there.

JULIE

(SHE LAUGHS)

When did you think of that?

HENRY

Just now.

(THEN)

So what about it?

JULIE

What about what?

HENRY

Meeting me --

JULIE

-- I'm not going anywhere, Henry --

HENRY

You're not?

JULIE

No.

86.

HENRY

I thought that was your plan. Do the play

AND --

JULIE

Plans change, Henry. Okay?

JULIE (CONT'D)

I think I ran out of maple syrup.

HENRY

Is there a reason you didn't leave

before?

JULIE

Because life is fucked. It never works

out the way you want it to.

HENRY

Yeah. Well. Maybe...

(THEN)

But you could still meet me.

JULIE

Right! On the lam? You're dreaming.

HENRY

It was just an idea. Why not --

JULIE

This isn't going to work out, Henry.

JULIE (CONT'D)

Didn't we both know that?

HENRY

I didn't.

JULIE

I did.

87.

JULIE (CONT'D)

I think you should leave.

MAX (O.S.)

It's going to be incredible. I'm talking,

Florida...

MAX

Palm trees. Sandy beaches. All you can

eat sunshine. Grapefruits as big as your

head!

HENRY

Why couldn't I have met her after?

MAX

Who?

HENRY

Julie. I asked her to meet me. After

we're done.

MAX

Oh yeah? What'd she say?

HENRY

She said no.

MAX

Of course she said no.

HENRY

Why of course?

MAX

Because life ain't like that. There's

always a cost. That's why they call it

life. You got to pay somewhere. The piper

must be paid to pipe.

88.

HENRY

I paid already, Max.

(THEN)

I don't want to leave her.

MAX

Who's that?

HENRY

I'll check.

HENRY (CONT'D)

Who is it?

JOE (O.S.)

It's me. Joe.

JOE (CONT'D)

Sorry, Henry.

EDDIE

The same bank. Shit, Henry. Now that's

poetry! I like it.

MAX

Who is this guy?

EDDIE

Your new partner.

MAX

What do you mean?

EDDIE

I'm in. Or you're out.

JOE

I screwed up. Sorry, Max.

EDDIE

(amused by the whole thing)

Joe tells me you guys might need a little

help with that vault. I know the whole story.

89.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

And I don't dig. Dig?

(THEN)

Got any cold ones?

MAX

Joe doesn't know what he's talking about.

He's a drunk. He made a mistake. Get out

of that chair.

EDDIE

Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back.

We've known each other since high school,

isn't that right?

HENRY

Yeah. I know you.

EDDIE

Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut,

Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the

quality of loyalty.

HENRY

What do you want, Eddie?

EDDIE

Nothing. Just the American dream.

CUT TO :

MAX

I'm gonna kill him. With a knife.

HENRY

You can't kill him.

JOE

(slurred, on the floor)

Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got

the vault --

MAX

Shut up, Joe.

90.

JOE

Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's

born. Says the kid'll know about it.

MAX

Go home. Please. Before it's too late.

CUT TO :

TROFIMOV

I'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's

sake, the man has robbed you.

MADAME RANEVSKY

(stopping her ears)

No! No! No! Don't say that!

TROFIMOV

He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but

you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user...

MADAME RANEVSKY

You are twenty six or twenty seven, and

you're still in the lower grades!

TROFIMOV

Who cares?

MADAME RANEVSKY

You ought to be grown up by now. At your

age, you ought to understand about love --

DAREK

Where are you, Djula? Where?!

MADAME RANEVSKY

(with double the fire)

You ought to love someone yourself! You

ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes!

DAREK

Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene.

(THEN)

Carlotta and the girls.

(MORE)

91.

DAREK (CONT'D)

(A CLAP)

Let's run the magic scene!

HENRY

What happened last night?

JULIE

I came to my senses.

(THEN)

And you should too.

HENRY

We should talk about it.

JULIE

I don't want to, Henry.

MAX

(tugging the pulley)

Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it.

JOE

What do you think guys? If it's a boy do

I cut him or not?

MAX

Well, you know what they say, cleanliness

is next to Godliness.

JOE

What do you say, Henry?

92.

VOICE (O.S.)

I see you guys in the bank. I see you

guys in the alley next to the bank.

FRANK

Now I see you coming out of the theatre

behind the bank.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I know what you're up to Gentlemen.

FRANK (CONT'D)

And I want in.

MAX

In on what?

FRANK

We can't talk here. Let's drive.

HENRY

What's on your mind, Frank?

FRANK

The I.C.R.E. Indigenous Currency

Retrieval and Exchange.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Once a month a truck goes to all our

partner banks across the border in

Canada, picks up all the currency and

brings it back home.

93.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I'd say on average eight to twelve

million, held in our vault at First

Buffalo for just a few hours before it's

picked up for redistribution.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Only a bunch of fools would rob that bank

any other time.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I can give you that date. I can help with

alarms. I can be your guy on the inside.

MAX

Hypothetically say you were right about

what we're up to...which you're not. But

just say...why would you help us rob your

bank?

FRANK

I got my reasons.

JOE

This sounds like a set-up, man --

FRANK

I don't fuck around, kid. I told you. I

got my reasons.

MAX

Well, forgive us, Frank. But we're going

to need to hear them.

FRANK

The wife got sick a few years ago.

Insurance wouldn't pick up all the costs.

So I went to the bank. They wouldn't help

cover the difference. We were going to

retire to the Loire valley.

(DARKLY)

We had to use all our savings to cover

the bills.

JOE

(GETTING IT)

The man gave it to you, huh.

94.

FRANK

I spent everything we had -- then she

died...thirty years I've been at that

bank.

HENRY

What was her name?

FRANK

Annie. Her name was Annie.

HENRY

I'm Sorry.

FRANK

November 23rd. The money's delivered at

eight and picked up at midnight.

FRANK (CONT'D)

I retire in two weeks. This is it.

(THEN)

You set up the table. I make sure dinner

arrives hot.

HENRY

Shit.

HENRY (CONT'D)

Opening night.

MAX

And?

HENRY

That's soon.

MAX

We're going to have pull some nights.

HENRY

Maybe we should wait. Do it closing

night.

95.

MAX

We can't. He's retiring. This is a one

time deal.

(THEN)

I told you there were going to be tests,

Henry.

MAX (CONT'D)

You're going to have to leave her.

(BEAT)

No looking back.

CUT TO :

REVEAL HENRY

HENRY'S POV

HENRY

MAX

There he is!

96.

MAX (CONT'D)

You okay, Henry?

HENRY

No.

HENRY (CONT'D)

I'm not leaving her.

JOE

Who?

MAX

The girl --

MAX (CONT'D)

Now listen, Henry. You're digging this

tunnel. And you're gonna rob that bank.

You're gonna take the money and you're

gonna put it in the car and we're gonna

drive away.

(THEN)

This is one thing. Julie is another

thing. This is not that. That is not

this. Understand?

ON HENRY

JOE

Hey! I think I got something...

MAX

We have arrived! Look at that.

97.

HENRY

Not a cloud in the sky.

MAX

So clear you can see tomorrow.

(THEN)

You're a good man, Henry. Thank you.

HENRY

You too, Max. Let's go.

CUT TO:

DAREK

In this `American dream' of ours,

everyone is happy and smiling, they have

achieved their objectives...and yet in

life there is only change, upheaval, the

birth of the new...and that birth is

painful.

ON JULIE

DAREK (CONT'D)

Our play is about misery, disconnection,

a future that we don't see hitting us

like a train...but tonight, my players,

we show them...that this not a future to

fear!

GAYEV

(THRILLED)

Off the cushion in the corner ; double

into the centre pocket!

98.

SIMON

Ten minutes people!

JULIE

Come in.

HENRY

I want you to meet me in California.

JULIE

Henry, we've been over this --

HENRY

We're doing it tonight.

JULIE

What?

HENRY

It's the only time we can get in the

VAULT --

JULIE

Of course! Opening night. What else? Like

I said, everything always fucks up --

HENRY

Nothing's fucked up. If it's tonight or a

month from now, what's the difference? I

still want you to meet me.

JULIE

Nothing's fucked up? Have you looked

around recently? You're leaving. What

about the goddamn play?

HENRY

Arnold's coming back. Max arranged it

already.

JULIE

I'm sure he did.

HENRY

I want us to be together.

99.

JULIE

We screwed a couple of times, Henry! So

what?

HENRY

You know that's not true --

JULIE

No, really. A couple of times.

(THEN)

Don't you get it? I don't want to be with

you.

JULIE (CONT'D)

You're a thief. Go rob your bank.

MAX

Enjoy the show, folks!

SIMON

SIMON

Curtain!

THE NURSERY

100.

LOPHAKIN

Well, thank god the train is in. What

time is it?

DUNYASHA

(checks his watch)

Almost two.

(blowing out the candle)

It's light already.

LOPHAKIN

The train's late. At least two hours.

BERNIE

How you doin', Frank?

FRANK

Doin' good, Bernie. Real good.

101.

MADAME RANEVSKY

My nursery, my dear, beautiful, sweet

nursery! This is where I used to sleep

when I was a little girl!

MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D)

I'm still like a little girl...

GAYEV

Your train was two hours late. How do you

explain that? Is that good management?

"YOU"

MAX

Shit.

MADAME RANEVSKY

Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood!

I used to sleep in this nursery.

(MORE)

102.

MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D)

I looked out from here into the garden. I

woke up happy every morning.

HENRY

Isn't she beautiful?

SIMON

Yes.

MADAME RANEVSKY

Oh, my cherry orchard...

ON FRANK

BERNIE

You ever think what you could do with all

that money, Frank?

STAN

I know what you'd do. Buy the Bills and

put them in first place.

BERNIE

You'd need a lot more money than that.

But I guarantee you I'd have them back in

the Super Bowl within two seasons.

STAN

Perfect. Another chance to lose.

MAX

Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little

pischer?

103.

BERNIE

We're good.

LOPHAKIN (O.S.)

I saw this excellent piece of theatre

yesterday. Really very funny.

104.

MADAME RANEVSKY

I'm sure it wasn't in the least funny. I

believe people like you should examine

their own lives instead of going to the

theatre to observe other peoples!

LOPHAKIN

True enough. To be honest. We live a

stupid life.

STAN

Well this is it, Frank.

BERNIE

We got you something.

STAN

A little retirement gift.

STAN (CONT'D)

Go ahead. Open it.

FRANK

Thanks guys.

BERNIE

We wanted to get you something from

France.

STAN

You like French Roast, right?

FRANK

Thanks.

(THEN)

You know this isn't from France.

BERNIE

What are you talking about? It's French

roast.

FRANK

Right. But over there they call it coffee.

STAN

(slightly baffled, at Bernie)

But this is French roast...

105.

EDDIE

Where is he? Where's that old man?

MAX

Julie -- Break a leg!

JULIE

Play's already started, Max.

JULIE (CONT'D)

Good-bye confidence man.

MAX

Good-bye, Julie.

EDDIE --

MAX

Go! Go! Go!

EDDIE

About time, old man.

MAX

Do your job.

EDDIE

Jesus! Not again! What is it with you?

JOE

Sorry.

106.

EDDIE

You're a pussy, Joe, you know that?

MADAME RANEVSKY

Well, what should we do? Tell us what to do?

LOPHAKIN

I tell you every day. Every day I say the

same thing over and over. You must rent

out the Cherry Orchard and the rest of

the Estate for villas. At once, right

this second, the auction is coming up

very soon --

MADAME RANEVSKY

It's all so vulgar!

MAX

That was good, kid. Good acting.

JOE

(a little giddy)

There she is.

EDDIE

Get out of there!

EDDIE (CONT'D)

This shit comes straight from hell.

107.

EDDIE

Welcome to my world, bitches.

JOE

Fuck, yeah.

ON HENRY

MAX

(SMILING)

You're on, Henry!

MADAME RANEVSKY (O.S.)

Is the cherry orchard sold?

LOPHAKIN

Yes.

108.

MADAME RANEVSKY

Who bought it?

LOPHAKIN

I did.

LOPHAKIN (CONT'D)

I bought it. Wait a minute ; don't rush

me. I'm all dizzy. I can't talk...

JOE

Deb's gonna freak.

LOPHAKIN

...and now the Cherry Orchard is mine.

Mine!

(LAUGHING)

God! God in heaven. The Cherry Orchard is

mine! Tell me I'm drunk, tell me I'm out

of my mind, tell me I'm dreaming!

MAX

That's everything.

EDDIE

Yes, it is.

MAX

What's that, Eddie?

109.

EDDIE

It's a gun, Max.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

(with the gun)

Joe! Take the money out back to my car.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Joe!

MAX

Stay right where you are, Joe.

EDDIE

Don't be stupid, Max.

MAX

You're not going to do this, Eddie.

MAX (CONT'D)

You can shoot me dead if you want, but

you're going to have to shoot me dead.

EDDIE

I'm not playing with you, old man.

JOE

What are you doing, Eddie?

EDDIE

Welcome to the party, Brando.

HENRY

What are you doing, Eddie?

EDDIE

It's money, Henry. Money.

110.

MAX

This was your chance you idiot. You

could've been a better man but you did it

again. You messed up. And now you're back

with the maggots. Just one big missed

opportunity.

JOE

Yeah. Come on, Eddie. We're here. We're

done. He's right. Come on, man.

EDDIE

Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in

the car. Shut up.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

Now move, Torne. No happy ending for you.

EDDIE (CONT'D)

You animal!

EDDIE

You couldn't have done this without me.

MAX

Our new partner. Huh.

111.

MAX (CONT'D)

You ok?

HENRY

I got shot.

HENRY (CONT'D)

I gotta get on stage.

GAYEV

Thank you, my friends, thank you.

YASHA

The peasants have come to say good-bye.

(THEN)

They're good fellows, Yermolai

Aleksayovich but in my opinion a little

stupid...

GAYEV

(to Madame Ranevsky)

You gave them everything in your purse,

Lyuba. Wrong, quite wrong!

MADAME RANEVSKY

I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it.

LOPHAKIN

(still a little out of

BREATH)

Won't you please come here and drink a

glass as a good-bye?

112.

MAX

Old man, huh.

MADAME RANEVSKY

We're going and not a soul will be here

until after we're gone.

LOPHAKIN

Until spring.

JOE

Where is he?

MAX

Any minute now.

ANYA

Goodbye, home! Goodbye to the old life!

TROFIMOV

Hello to the new life!

LOPHAKIN

Until the spring, then. Goodbye my

friends, until we meet again!

113.

GAYEV

My sister! My sister!

MADAME RANEVSKY

Oh, my dear, sweet, lovely orchard! My

life, my youth, my happiness, farewell!

Farewell!

TROFIMOV (O.S.)

Aa-oo!

MAX

How's the leg?

HENRY

It's fine. Go.

TROFIMOV (V.O.)

Aa-oo!

JULIE

We're coming.

HENRY

Stop the car!

MAX

Henry!

HENRY

Joe, stop the car.

MAX

He can't stop the car, it's the getaway!

JOE

Yeah, you can't --

HENRY

STOP THE FUCKING CAR!

MAX

What the hell are you doing?

MAX (CONT'D)

Henry!

115.

SHE FREEZES :

LOPHAKIN

I had to come back. I couldn't get on the

train. The moment I stepped on the

platform, the blood drained from my

heart.

LOPHAKIN (CONT'D)

I knew I might never see you again.

ON DAREK

DAREK

What is he doing? Why is Lophakin back?!

ON HENRY

LOPHAKIN

I had to come back.

MADAME RANEVSKY

(A WHISPER)

Henry, what is this? What are you doing?

LOPHAKIN

This is the only way you'll listen to me.

MADAME RANEVSKY

You should have gotten on that stupid

train. You made a mistake.

LOPHAKIN

The mistake would have been getting on that

train without telling you how I feel.

MADAME RANEVSKY

Ha! Don't pretend you care about me. All

you care about is money.

116.

LOPHAKIN

You think this is about money?

MADAME RANEVSKY

Yes.

HENRY

It's never been about money. You know

that.

MADAME RANEVSKY

Let go of me!

LOPHAKIN

No.

MADAME RANEVSKY

Damn it! Just leave, Henry!

(under her breath)

Get off the fucking stage --

HENRY

Take a chance. Meet me in Moscow.

MADAME RANEVSKY

No, I'm perfectly happy here.

HENRY

That's not true. Meet me in Moscow.

MADAME RANEVSKY

Let me go!

HENRY

I can't.

MADAME RANEVSKY

Why are you doing this?

LOPHAKIN

You're just afraid.

MADAME RANEVSKY

I'm not afraid of anything --

MADAME RANEVSKY (CONT'D)

What am I afraid of Henry? Tell me!

117.

LOPHAKIN

You're afraid because I love you.
