SHOOTING DRAFT

PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL

Thanks.

BRIAN

Her father worked the night shift

here. Most nights he'd bring her

with him.

(pause)

She was eleven years old.

BRIAN

This is it. This is the where he'd

take her whenever he had the urge to

molest her.

BRIAN

Of course! Nobody would have heard

her cries over the noise of the

machines.

DRIVER

Damn! This defroster never works...

PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL

...Mmm... feels good.

DRIVER

Have a problem with your car?

PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL

No.

(beat)

My problem's with men.

BRIAN

This is where she murdered her first

victim. They found his body over in

the corner, shot through the head.

BRIAN

They found her second victim over

there.

PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL

Okay if I smoke?

DRIVER

(unconvincingly)

...sure.

PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL

My matches are all wet. You got a

lighter?

DRIVER

(scans the dashboard)

Yeah. It's here somewhere. It's my

wife's car. Ah... there it is.

BRIAN

She lured them here with the promise

of sex.

(beat)

Imagine the anger and hatred she

must have felt returning to this

place. Did she use that to help her

pull the trigger?

CARRIE

Shhhhhhhhh.

CUT TO:

PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL

What's the matter?

DRIVER

(unconvincingly)

...nothing.

KIM (O.S.)

Are you dead or alive?

KIM (O.S.)

Brian?

BRIAN

Dead.

KIM (O.S.)

(sarcastic)

Obviously!

CARL

Man or woman?

BRIAN

Man.

CLAUDIA

Real or fictional.

BRIAN

Real.

CARRIE

Ted Bundy.

CLAUDIA

What a guess!

CARL

Doesn't count, she's disqualified.

CARRIE

Why?

CARL

Because you've been living with him,

and his thesis for the last year and

a half.

(beat)

He's probably been researching Ted

Bundy all week.

PETER

Carl, you are the world's worst loser!

CAROL

Any word from that gallery?

CARRIE

Not yet.

CAROL

Nervous?

CARRIE

...Apprehensive. Let's not forget

these are the people who banned the

Mapplethorpe show. Anyway,

California's loaded with galleries.

CAROL

(nods toward Brian)

You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed

to leave?

CARRIE

...Soon as he finishes his thesis.

CAROL

Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his

for over three years now.

CARRIE

Yeah, well Brian's got 'til the end

of the summer, then I'm outta here.

CAROL

I'm sorry, but I just can't see you

veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.

CARRIE

Oh, I don't know... I think that

once I dye my hair blonde, buy a

string bikini and cultivate that

tan... I could be veggin' out with

the best of 'em...

(does a valley-

girl/beach bunny)

Like fer shurr!

BRIAN

I'm talking about the mind and

culpability of a serial killer.

Someone who has no ability to

distinguish between right and wrong

should not be imprisoned, let alone

executed.

ERIC

Oh, here we go again. Let's just lay

it all at the altar of misfiring

synapses, amok biochemicals and

horrendous childhoods.

BRIAN

Look, it's a fact, most of these

people suffer from a severe chemical

brain imbalance.

(beat)

That enough Tequila?

ERIC

Probably not...

BRIAN

(to Eric)

The answer is research and treatment

under hospital supervised conditions,

not the electric chair!

PETER

Yeah, until it's your mother's head

they find in the refrigerator.

BRIAN

Executing the killer wouldn't bring

my mother back.

CARRIE

Thank god!

BRIAN

(sarcastic to Carrie)

Ha, ha.

ERIC

Yeah, but it'd sure make you feel

better, wouldn't it?

BRIAN

No, it wouldn't make me feel better.

PETER

...Looking for this?

CARRIE

(to Brian)

If I have to listen to one more

"tweed" talk about his dissertation,

I'm going to throw up.

ERIC

(to Brian)

Label it anyway you want, the bottom

line is these people are evil, plain

and simple.

BRIAN

(continuing with Eric)

Okay, now you want to talk about

good versus evil? Well then let's

start with Adam and Eve and the snake.

CARRIE

Who do I have to blow to get out of

here?

BRIAN

(reconsiders)

A... I gotta go.

EARLY

Coffee and a bowl of chili, please.

WAITRESS (O.S.)

...Be right there.

OLD MAN

(from beneath his

shadowy brim...)

The Antichrist'll be a woman, in a

man's body. Seven heads and seven

tails.

EARLY

Make that to go.

EARLY

...Size 6.

EARLY

That's right ain't it, size 6?

EARLY

Happy birthday Adele.

ADELE

Early, you are so sweet.

ADELE

I feel kind of like the wizard of

oz, you know when she gets the red

shoes.

EARLY

Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me

that chili there.

BRIAN

Tonight turned out to be pretty

interesting.

CARRIE

The party?

BRIAN

The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.

CARRIE

It was definitely the high point of

the evening.

BRIAN

(getting excited)

Just being there where it really

happened. It was different... more

visceral.

CARRIE

Mmm... I love it when you talk like

that.

ADELE

You thirsty Lucy?

ADELE

Bet that feels good, don't it?

ADELE

Now if that ain't Momma's little

angel.

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

...two more victims last night, when

a twenty pound rock smashed through

the windshield of their car...

NEWSCASTER

This was the third such attack in

the past month and while an extensive

police operation is underway... no

arrests have yet been made.

ADELE

Early...

ADELE

Have a good one.

ADELE

Oh... I forgot to tell you, Mr.

Diebold was by again yesterday.

ADELE

He said, if he ain't got the rest of

his money by the end of the month,

he's gonna "kick us the...

(spells the word fuck

to avoid saying it)

F-U-C-K outta here."

EARLY

He said that, huh? Cursed in front

of you?

ADELE

You gonna talk to him?

EARLY

If he comes back, don't answer the

door.

ADELE

Suppose he hears me inside?

BRIAN

I picked up some Chinese. Did you

hear from the gallery?

BRIAN

(tentative)

You got your slides back.

CARRIE

Yeah, same old shit. Too graphic...

not suitable for mass consumption...

one of those... I forget. Who cares.

CARRIE

Christ Brian I'm dying here... you

are too, you just don't know it yet.

You're too busy working on that damned

thesis... And, thing is... when you

finally do finish it, it's just gonna

get filed away on some shelf at the

University Library... then what?

CARRIE

(continues)

I thought you wanted to be a writer.

BRIAN

(quietly)

...I do.

CARRIE

Then you can write anywhere. Let's

get out of here, while we still can.

BRIAN

Carrie, come on... we can leave

anytime we...

CARRIE

No we can't. We can never leave once

you start talking about tenure...

and vacation pay... and parking

privileges and... oh shit! let's

just go to California now, right

now, before it's too late.

BRIAN

...just like that?

CARRIE

Just like that. Load up the Lincoln...

point it West... stop when we hit

the fucking ocean.

CARRIE

That's half the kick anyway. Doing

something you've never done before.

Experiencing something... different.

Something... unpredictable.

BRIAN

...These are great.

EARLY

Adele, who's car's that out...

PAROLE OFFICER

She's not here.

EARLY

What are you doin' here? I ain't

supposed to be at the Parole Office

'til tomorrow, two o'clock.

PAROLE OFFICER

Social call.

PAROLE OFFICER

You're supposed to call me when you

lose your job Early. I stopped by

the mirror factory today, you left

quite a mess behind there.

EARLY

Wasn't my fault...

EARLY

...It was dangerous there and they

treated me like shit.

PAROLE OFFICER

(swallows a hiccup)

Yeah... Well you never have been

'treated right'... Have you?

(hiccup)

Your father was pickin' on you when

he threw you out of the house for

stealing the tires off his truck.

The Marines misunderstood you when

they gave you that dishonorable

discharge.

PAROLE OFFICER

(hiccup)

...The police were way out of line

when they stopped you from beating

that bartender half to death. And no

doubt God'll be pickin' on you on

Judgement Day...

EARLY

I ain't got nothing against God.

It's the people he let come into the

world... lot of them should have

been stopped at the door. What are

you looking for?

PAROLE OFFICER

That girlfriend of yours ain't much

for housekeeping, is she.

EARLY

I'm thinking about moving...

EARLY

Maybe down to Texas... Probably get

some work on them offshore oil rigs.

Hear the pay's good... hell, the

weather's got to be better'n here.

PAROLE OFFICER

What are you talking about? You know

you can't leave the state.

(hiccup)

What you can do is get a job.

PAROLE OFFICER

You be at this personnel office,

Friday, three o'clock sharp.

EARLY

What is it?

PAROLE OFFICER

...Janitor's job.

EARLY

Oh man... come on, I don't want no

janitor job.

PAROLE OFFICER

Hey, I don't give two shits about

what you want or don't want... I'm

telling you to be there Friday, three

o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be

here for dinner. You understand?

EARLY

You oughta think about putting a bag

over your head... Might cure them

hiccups.

BRIAN

Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake

you.

CARRIE

Thanks. What are you doing?

BRIAN

Well, I sat down with my tapes and

your photographs, which are great by

the way... and I started writing.

CARRIE

So how's it going?

BRIAN

...I think it's the best stuff I've

done.

BRIAN

...and I think I know why.

CARRIE

Why?

BRIAN

Because I was there. And for a moment

that night I understood how she came

to pull the trigger.

CARRIE

(sarcastic)

This mean your finally going to finish

your thesis?

BRIAN

Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's

a book here. Your photographs and my

research, together.

CARRIE

A book on the warehouse murders?

BRIAN

A book on some of the most infamous

murderers in America. I want to go

to where they lived and where they

killed and I want you to photograph

it.

BRIAN

What I'm thinking is, we can drop

down through Tennessee, across

Arkansas and into Texas, from there

it's a straight shot into California.

(pause)

"We don't stop... until we hit the

fucking ocean."

CARRIE

It's about fucking time, Kessler!

I'd just about given up on you.

BRIAN

We don't have enough money, but we'll

figure something out.

BRIAN

...It's either the best idea I've

had in a long time... or there's way

too much MSG in this stuff.

DIEBOLD

(shouts)

Hold on a minute there boy!

EARLY

Shit!

DIEBOLD

Goddamit, you're gonna settle up

that rent here and now.

DIEBOLD

I've had it with your bullshit boy.

I want my money.

DIEBOLD

(hollering)

You sonofabitch! Come back here!

DIEBOLD

That's it! You tell him... I want

you both the fuck out of here by

Sunday or I'm gonna call the Police.

DIEBOLD

...You won't be laughing come Sunday

little girl.

DIEBOLD

Elvis! Get the fuck off him!

CAROL

You know, they say one of these

days...

BRIAN

(sarcastic)

...the whole thing's going to slide

into the ocean... Yeah, I know.

CAROL

"Looking for someone to take turns

at the wheel and share expenses...

on a week long cross country blue-

highways tour of historic murder

sites..."

(beat)

You gotta be kidding. Who in their

right mind would want to do that?

BRIAN

...I would.

CAROL

(watching Brian walk

away)

Like I said...

EARLY

Where's the personnel office at?

RITA

(points down the hall)

First door on the left.

ADELE

Early?

ADELE

Early? You down there?

EARLY

(from inside the hole)

What's up Adele? Dinner ready?

ADELE

Almost.

ADELE

Early...

ADELE

Tell me more about California.

EARLY

Well... for one thing... They think

faster out there, on account of all

that warm weather they got; cold

weather makes people stupid, that's

a fact.

ADELE

I guess that'd explain why there's

so many stupid people around here.

EARLY

Yeah, and in California you never

have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on

the trees everywhere you turn...

(beat)

...and, 'course there ain't no speed

limit out there, and all drugs are

legal... And I heard your first

month's rent is free; state law. I

figure 'til we get settled we can

just move around month to month...

ADELE

What'll we do out there?

EARLY

Well... the very first thing we're

gonna do... is get us a couple of

six packs of Lucky Lager and climb

up on toppa' that famous Hollywood

sign and howl at the moon...

ADELE

You know... I read once... Ain't

nothin' on that big old moon 'cept

some old golf balls those astronauts

left behind.

EARLY

Bull. That ain't right... Government

sends people there all the time,

just don't want us to know about it.

ADELE

Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout

ready.

EARLY

I heard that.

CARRIE

What did he sound like on the phone?

BRIAN

Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'

BRIAN

(grins)

I like that.

CARRIE

I still think we should have met

them first.

BRIAN

Beggars can't be choosers. They were

the only ones who answered the ride

share note, remember?

CARRIE

Please God, we're gonna be stuck

with these people for a week, don't

let them be as boring as Brian's

friends. Anything... but that.

BRIAN

Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent

right outta "Deliverance."

(quotes from the movie)

"Still? Who said anything about a

still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"

CARRIE

Funny, very funny.

BRIAN

(quoting again)

"Aintry? This river don't go to

Aintry."

ADELE

We shouldn't be doin' this, Early.

You leavin' the state, ridin' around

with strangers... besides, what kinda

people would want to stop at places

where other people was murdered.

ADELE

What if they're dangerous?

EARLY

They ain't dangerous Adele. They're

writers.

ADELE

Early Grayce!

ADELE

(changes subject)

Did you settle things with Mr.

Diebold?

EARLY

Yeah I left him with the car... We're

all squared up now.

EARLY

What's this?

ADELE

Early!

EARLY

What kind of a person would carry a

cactus in her purse!

CARRIE

You've got to be kidding me, they

look like Okies!

CARRIE

Jesus... They've probably got five

bucks between them. Turn around.

BRIAN

Lighten up...

ADELE

Geez, they look kinda weird.

EARLY

You just smile, let me do all the

talking.

ADELE

How many times you gonna tell me

that?

EARLY

(smiling at Brian)

As many times as it takes.

BRIAN

Hi I'm Brian... Early, and you must

be Adele.

BRIAN

Let me help you.

ADELE

Hi, I'm Adele.

CARRIE

(reserved)

Carrie.

ADELE

(shyly)

I like your hair.

CARRIE

...Pardon?

ADELE

...I said, I like your hair.

CARRIE

...Thank you.

BRIAN

Tight fit.

EARLY

Best kind.

BRIAN

Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and

Adele haven't had time for breakfast,

Early.

EARLY

Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.

BRIAN

Brian.

EARLY

Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't

eat much in the mornin', never have.

Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky

Lager's my favorite.

ADELE

It's because of what he read in a

book once... That folks needin'

breakfast is a myth, or whatever,

put out by those cereal people.

BRIAN

So what do you do Early?

EARLY

Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick

Mirror factory, or I used to...

ADELE

One night we figured out how much

bad luck he must have comin' from

all them mirrors he broke...

(beat)

Four hundred and ninety four years

to work it all off... After he dies,

he'll have to keep coming back to

earth over and over and over...

CARRIE

Karma.

ADELE

What?

CARRIE

Karma...

(beat)

You know, if you do something bad to

somebody fate will pay you back by

something bad happening to you.

ADELE

That French ain't it?

BRIAN

So Adele, did Early happen to mention

the places we'll be stopping at?

EARLY

Yeah Bri' I did.

ADELE

(to Carrie)

Are you takin' the pictures?

CARRIE

(surprised)

...Yeah.

ADELE

Is it hard to learn?

CARRIE

Not really.

EARLY

(to Brian)

You gonna talk to the people who did

those murders?

BRIAN

That's a good idea. Unfortunately

most of them have been executed.

EARLY

...Too bad.

PAROLE OFFICER

What happened?

POLICE OFFICER

Who are you?

PAROLE OFFICER

His Parole Officer.

POLICE OFFICER

Right, I talked to you on the phone.

They say it's a torch job, that sound

like your boy?

PAROLE OFFICER

Could be.

POLICE OFFICER

Where would we find him?

PAROLE OFFICER

Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch

said he was thinking of moving to

Texas.

POLICE OFFICER

Without his car?

POLICE OFFICER

What about the owner of the house...

(reads from note pad)

...this John Diebold, any idea where

he might be?

PAROLE OFFICER

No, but I can tell you he's not gonna

be too happy about this.

LABORER (O.S.)

Jesus Christ!

PAROLE OFFICER

...Diebold?

POLICE OFFICER

...That'd be my guess.

PAROLE OFFICER

Looks like somebody cut off his ring

finger.

POLICE OFFICER

Well now I'd say that's the least of

Mr. Diebold's problems.

ADELE

Thank you.

EARLY

All right, who gets the...

(can't pronounce name)

...water.

EARLY

Here you go Bri'. Got a couple a

bags of chips and some jerky, just

holler if you want some.

EARLY

Can't hurt.

BRIAN

How much do I owe you?

EARLY

Forget it.

ADELE

(embarrassed)

Guess I don't know the first thing

about cameras.

CARRIE

Well, the first thing... is you need

film. Preferably black and white.

ADELE

You wouldn't have any color film,

would ya?

CARRIE

...Yeah, sure.

ADELE

I like things in color, pink, purple,

and red. I dunno, black and white is

kinda... boring.

CARRIE

You just aim and press the button.

ADELE

Look, Pigeon Forge!

ADELE

I've heard of that! It's where Dolly

Parton has her park. "Dollywood". I

just think that's so clever.

Hollywood. Dollywood. Get it?

EARLY

(under his breath)

Shush, Adele.

ADELE

Early, can we stop there... just for

a little while.

ADELE (O.S.)

...I've always wanted to go there...

It could be such fun.

FADE OUT:

BRIAN

The Novaks are all gone but the fence

that Michael Zaruba was hired to put

up is still here.

BRIAN

The Novaks embraced the young drifter

as one of their own.

ADELE

Hey you two.

ADELE

Give me a smile now.

BRIAN

(continues into tape

recorder)

Neighbors said he was a quiet young

man, who was often seen pushing the

children on the swing set.

BRIAN

(continuing)

Everything was fine until the day

the family ran out of work for

Michael, and had to ask him to leave.

BRIAN

Sorry, Early... Could you step out

the way, for a second?

BRIAN

The first one to die was the nine

year old daughter...

BRIAN

Hello.

BRIAN

...My name's Brian, what's yours?

BRIAN

...Could I speak to your parents?

GIRL

(rudely)

Pa! There's more of them.

BRIAN

(friendly)

Hi, my name is Brian Kessler.

BRIAN

(continues -- less

confident)

I'm a writer, I'm working on a book

about famous murderers.

BRIAN

...I'm sure you're aware that this

is the Novak house...

BRIAN

(corrects himself)

...I mean, this was the Novak house...

(pause)

With your permission I'd like to

come in and photograph...

FARMER

(muttering)

Goddamned ghouls...

BRIAN

(upset)

We could have been in and out of

there in less than ten minutes...

CARRIE

Hey, I got some great stuff... it's

okay.

CARRIE

It's okay... okay?

BRIAN

(continuing on the

heel of the kiss)

...That house is part of American

history now, whether he likes it or

not.

EARLY

Forget about it Bri'. I wouldn't be

surprised if that Karma thing don't

come back and get him.

BRIAN

(studying his map)

Well we've come three hundred miles

so far. Not a bad day's haul.

BRIAN

You got any family or friends in

California, Early?

EARLY

(chewing)

Nope... You?

BRIAN (O.S.)

No.

ADELE (O.S.)

Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?

CARRIE (O.S.)

No.

ADELE

...Well, least we got each other.

That's somethin'.

EARLY

Thanks Bri', I'll get the next one.

(prompts Adele)

Think it's time we hit the sack.

ADELE

(to Carrie)

Sweet dreams.

CARRIE

(spits out a mouthful

of water)

You mean because I object to having

somebody take off their shoe and

scratch their foot while I'm eating

I'm prejudiced?

BRIAN

(reading notes)

He can't help the way he was raised.

I kinda feel sorry for him.

CARRIE

Feel sorry for him? Obviously you

didn't get a whiff of that sock?

BRIAN (O.S.)

Bitch, bitch, bitch!

CARRIE

(under her breath)

Up yours.

BRIAN

I heard that.

BRIAN (O.S.)

...heard that too.

EARLY

Can you believe thirty bucks for

this room... for what? A lumpy

mattress, that crummy TV and a

crapper.

ADELE (O.S.)

Early, sing me a song.

EARLY

Which one.

ADELE

(laughs)

Hey can we go to that Chinese

restaurant when we get to Los Angeles?

You know, to see all them famous

footprints?

EARLY

Only if they let me put mine down

too.

BRIAN (O.S.)

Look Carrie, we're gonna be stuck

with these people for a week...

BRIAN

...And all I'm saying is I think we

ought to try and get along with them.

That's all.

CARRIE

You try, I'm gonna pretend they're

with somebody else.

BRIAN

Carrie.

CARRIE

I don't want to talk about it.

CARRIE

Pretty smooth how he stiffed us on

dinner?

BRIAN

He didn't stiff us. He paid for the

gas remember.

CARRIE

I'm telling you he's nearly broke

and we're going to end up paying for

those two.

BRIAN

You finished?

CARRIE

...Um, maybe... maybe not.

CARRIE

...Um... Funky fucking sock.

CARRIE

...and what's with that hair? Is

that grease or motor oil or what?

CARRIE

...you believe that tattoo? Looks

like he had another girls name there

and carved it out.

CARRIE

...and that body odor.

BRIAN

Morning...

EARLY

Bri'.

CARRIE

Where's Adele?

EARLY

She wasn't feeling so good.

WAITRESS

Breakfast?

EARLY

(burps)

Nah... Don't eat breakfast. Never

have.

WAITRESS

Ah sir... sir.

WAITRESS

(concerned)

We ah... don't have a liquor license

here. So I'm afraid...

EARLY

Well don't be, I got plenty more

where this one came from.

CARRIE

(at a loss for words)

You cut your hair.

ADELE

Early cut it.

(smiles at Early)

...Once he gets an idea in his head

there's no holding him back.

BRIAN

Nice job Early.

EARLY

...Need a hand with those bags?

CARRIE

No, thanks, I can manage.

EARLY

I got 'em.

BRIAN (O.S.)

All set?

CARRIE

(startled)

Fuck!

BRIAN

Take your time.

EARLY

(starts to read)

This the book your writing?

BRIAN

It's just a work in progress, kinda

rough.

EARLY

This guy killed a mess of people.

BRIAN

Who?

EARLY

Henry Lucas.

BRIAN

Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only

convicted of killing eleven but he

claimed to have killed over three

hundred.

EARLY

Wonder what all them people done

made him so mad?

EARLY

Here Bri' let me do that.

EARLY

How did he get away with it for so

long anyhow?

BRIAN

He almost always killed strangers.

Spent years moving on from one place

to another. That made it real hard

to track him down.

CARRIE

You dropped this.

ADELE

Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky

day.

BRIAN

I guess it's your turn to pay Early.

ADELE

I used to smoke before I met Early.

But he broke me of that.

CARRIE

Broke you?

ADELE

Early don't think women should smoke

or curse or drink liquor.

CARRIE

So you don't do any of those things.

ADELE

Better not, or Early'd whip me.

CARRIE

(back to Adele)

He whips you?

ADELE (O.S.)

Only when I deserve it.

EARLY

(friendly)

Hey Bri'... ah... You don't want to

go in there. It's a real mess, if

you know what I mean.

BRIAN

That bad?

EARLY

...Then some.

ATTENDANT

(to Carrie)

Comes to twenty eight dollars.

CARRIE

Talk to him.

EARLY

Call it an even thirty.

EARLY

I'll drive Bri'.

EARLY

Adele, get in the back.

ADELE

...Hey you're good. Thought you said

you never played before?

CARRIE

I haven't... I'm a fast learner.

EARLY

...They never caught that Black Dolya

Killer, huh?

BRIAN

Dahlia, no.

EARLY

Now why is that?

BRIAN

Some people think it's because he

never killed again. He just

disappeared back into society.

EARLY

You don't sound too convinced 'bout

that?

BRIAN

I always thought it was the work of

a serial killer. Anyone who took

that much time and care bisecting

another human being must have been

enjoying it and would have done it

again. And again. Until someone

stopped him.

EARLY

That your... "theory", ain't that

what they call it?

BRIAN

Yeah.

EARLY

You wanna hear mine?

BRIAN

(amused)

Sure.

EARLY

Ain't you goin' to record it?

BRIAN

(into tape)

Early Grayce, June twenty third.

EARLY

(into tape)

Well I'll just bet he's still alive.

Old, livin' in some trailer park or

somethin' somewhere, but still alive.

Thinkin' every night 'bout what he

done. Goin' over and over it in his

mind. How smart he was for getting

away with it.

ADELE

(to Carrie)

You lose!

BRIAN

(to Early)

I suppose anything's possible.

EARLY

You ever play any pool Bri'?

BRIAN (O.S.)

I can hold my own...

CARRIE (O.S.)

Hey Minnesota Fats!

CARRIE

(sarcastic)

Don't forget your key.

BRIAN

Why'd I open my big mouth?

CARRIE

(to Adele)

Why didn't you go with them?

ADELE

I told you how Early feels 'bout a

woman drinking.

CARRIE

How'd you meet Early?

ADELE

(grins)

I was hitchhiking' one day and he

picked me up. At first I wasn't gonna

get in on account of his car was in

such sorry shape. I said, "I ain't

never seen a white man drivin' a car

like this."

ADELE

(continues)

An' he said right back, "You shouldn't

judge by appearances little lady...

this vehicle might just be a flying

saucer disguised as a car, for all

you know."

ADELE

Well, I got in and we got to talkin',

and the next thing I know, I'd moved

in with him in this old trailer.

(beat)

Hey! Wouldn't it be something if we

all ended up sharing a house together

in California?

CARRIE

You know I can fix that haircut for

you, if you want?

ADELE

You can?

EARLY

I wonder if there's any "doors" out

here?

EARLY

You know... "openings" to other

dimensions.

(pause)

I read there are a lot of them out

West, mostly in the desert. They say

if you know what you're doing, you

can travel anywhere in the Universe

in a matter of seconds. Wouldn't

that come in handy?

BRIAN

By the way, I'm not much of a pool

player.

EARLY

Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I

can teach you everything ya need ta

know.

BRIAN

Yeah?

EARLY

Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few

points first game.

BRIAN

Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle

me?

EARLY

Nah... how much money have you got?

ADELE

How do you get your cigarette to

stay there like that.

CARRIE

I'm cool.

ADELE

Could I try that?

ADELE

What's this?

CARRIE

It's a portfolio of my work.

ADELE

Your pictures. Can I see 'em?

CARRIE

Sure.

ADELE

Jesus!

ADELE

You took this picture?

CARRIE

Took 'em all.

CARRIE

That's me.

ADELE

No it is not!

CARRIE

Hold still.

ADELE

Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early

found a picture of me like that I'd

be black and blue for a week.

CARRIE

(suddenly serious)

You shouldn't let him do that to

you...

ADELE

Do what?

CARRIE

Adele... are you serious?

ADELE

(defensive)

You think Early's bad to me, don't

you?

CARRIE

Yeah.

ADELE

Well... You're wrong. I ain't saying

Early ain't never hit me... but he

never hurt me.

ADELE

(continues)

...When I was fourteen years old

three boys raped me in the back of a

truck, and beat me so bad I was in

bed for almost four months...

(beat)

...I feel safe with Early, most the

time he treats me pretty good. And I

know he wouldn't let nothin' like

that ever happen to me again...

ADELE

Hey, that ain't so bad now.

LARGE YOUNG CRACKER

When you gonna give me so o' that!

WAITRESS

Maybe when you grow up a little sonny.

BRIAN

These aren't Lucky Lager, I ordered

Lucky Lager.

WAITRESS

Sorry honey, 'ain't nothin Lucky

around here.

YOUNG CRACKER

What did you say to her city boy!

BRIAN

Nothing, I jus...

YOUNG CRACKER

(cuts him off)

What's a jism gargling cum drunk

fairy like you looking at a pretty

girl like that for anyway?

EARLY

(matter of factly)

You'd better hit him first Bri',

'cos it's comin'.

YOUNG CRACKER

This yur' boyfriend?

BRIAN

(dumbfounded)

What?

EARLY

Hit him.

EARLY

(angry)

Bri' this shit ain't Lucky Lager!

YOUNG CRACKER

(to Early)

Hey Asshole!

BRIAN

They don't stock it here Early.

YOUNG CRACKER

(to Early, furious)

Why you fuckin'...

WAITRESS

Sorry about that, he's always causing

trouble.

WAITRESS

These are on the house.

ADELE

My momma's a beautician. Guess that's

where I get it from. She wouldn't

hear of my moving in with Early...

on account of his just getting out

of jail and all. Ain't seen her in

nearly a year now. I wish she'd call

me, just once.

CARRIE

(interrupting)

What's Early been in jail for?

ADELE

(reluctantly)

Carryin' a gun.

CARRIE

...Anything else?

ADELE

An' resistin' arrest... At least

that's what the Police said.

CARRIE

Jeez... Adele!

ADELE

I'd better be goin'. It's late.

CARRIE

Great.

EARLY

Got to see a man about a mule.

EARLY

Gotta take a piss.

EARLY

Any reebs left in the back seat?

EARLY

Aaahhhhh...

(relief)

That's what we used to call a beer

when we was kids... Beer spelled

backwards.

BRIAN

Last one.

EARLY

...Well I probably drunk more than

my share, anyway... you go on an'

have it.

BRIAN

No, it's all yours. It's on me...

for saving my ass back there.

EARLY

Hey, that's what buddies are for,

right...?

EARLY

(voice drops almost

to a whisper)

You know those doors I was talking

about? Found two of them back in

Kentucky. Shit, I wasn't even looking

for one the first time. Me and the

boys are just swingin' our sickles

by the side of the road, and I turned

around and there it was... this door

with this bright blinding white light

all around it... course I'm thinkin'

I must be sunstroked or somethin'...

so I close my eyes figurin' I'll

count ten and it'll be gone right...

so I'm countin'...

(he closes his eyes)

...1-2-3-4-5... an' I'm 'bout ta

piss myself right... -6-7-8-9... 10.

An' I open my eyes slow, spectin' it

won't be there right...

EARLY

(unconvincingly)

...and it wasn't.

BRIAN

What were you "swinging a sickle"

for?

EARLY

For... 'bout three years.

BRIAN

Gotta see a man about a mule... What's

wrong?

CARRIE

The same thing that's been "wrong"

the whole trip. Your good buddy Early.

BRIAN

Who said he's my good buddy?

CARRIE

You sure been acting like you were...

(redneck accent)

...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin'

and ever' thang.

BRIAN

Hey come on, you two were drinking

too... so what's the big deal.

CARRIE

Yeah, and you should've seen how

terrified she was that he'd find

out. He beats her.

BRIAN

How do you know that?

CARRIE

She told me...

(adding)

...but only when she "deserves" it.

Did you know he was in jail?

BRIAN

Yeah, for stealing a car. Aaahhhh.

CARRIE (O.S.)

Bullshit!

CARRIE

...He told her it was for carrying a

gun, but the truth could be murder

for all we know.

BRIAN

Stop being so fucking melodramatic!

If it was murder he'd still be locked

up or on parole, in which case he

wouldn't be allowed to leave the

state.

CARRIE

Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave!

Geezus Brian!

BRIAN

(sarcastically)

Of course! The accent, the clothes,

and those table manners!... He's got

to be a mass murderer!

(pause)

What else could he be?

BRIAN

You know, it wouldn't even surprise

me if he turned out to be... a

Republican!

BRIAN

Goddamnit!... my fucking toe!

CARRIE

(to Brian inside room)

Try not to lose consciousness 'til I

get back.

EARLY

Ain't you done enough drinking for

tonight?

CARRIE

...Brian hurt his foot.

EARLY

Sometimes... Don't know why it is...

I get so hot I can't stand it. I

just start sweating like a dog. You

ever get like that?

CARRIE

(tenuous)

No.

EARLY

I can feel it start to run down my

neck...

(he turns his back to

show her)

...and down my back... right into my

pants.

EARLY

...and everything starts stickin'

together... keeps running down the

back of my legs like two rivers racin'

for my boots, see who gets there

first.

EARLY

You never get that hot, huh?

CARRIE

I gotta get back before this ice

melts.

EARLY

...never?

CARRIE

No, never. Excuse me.

EARLY

You like Skynard?

ADELE

My daddy always took sauerkraut juice

and tobasco sauce for a hangover,

mixed in one egg not two, and some

tomato juice...

BRIAN

I'm okay, thanks.

BRIAN

What! What!

BRIAN

What is it?

CARRIE

Look again!

EARLY

Only thing my old man ever gave me

is that goddamn .45.

EARLY

Bri', you're jerkin' it when you

pull the trigger, hold it real steady.

ADELE

Boys'll be boys.

ADELE

You know any tricks?

ADELE

You wanna learn some?

EARLY

Steady... Breath in... now let half

of it out, and... fire.

EARLY

Bri, I want you to keep this gun...

consider it a present. Never know,

California could turn out to be a

dangerous place.

EARLY

Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little

sleepy,... think Adele and me are

gonna take us a fiesta.

CARRIE

(pissed off)

Siesta.

CARRIE

What's that?

BRIAN

A copy of a tape they found. He

recorded everything.

BRIAN

(speaks into his small

hand held tape

recorder)

His mother had him working in here

before he was eight years old...

killing animals with a sledgehammer

that was bigger than he was.

BRIAN

When she was pissed at him, she'd

beat the shit out of him and lock

him in here overnight...

BRIAN

(continuing)

...Eventually the boy wakes up one

morning, picks up that sledgehammer

and starts hurting back.

BRIAN

There's more...

CARRIE

I'm finished.

BRIAN

Look... I know you're pissed off

about the gun, and I don't blame

you...

CARRIE

Brian, I'm not pissed off. God damm

it, turn that thing off.

CARRIE

I'm scared. A week ago you would

never have even thought to pick up

that gun. This afternoon you're out

there wielding it around like Clyde

fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake!

What's with you?

BRIAN

Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was

stupid, I admit it, alright?

(pause)

But let's not blow this. Not now...

Let's just get the photos.

CARRIE

I can't believe I agreed to do this.

BRIAN

Oh come on, don't give me that shit...

you wanted to take these photos as

much as I wanted you too.

CARRIE

Wrong! I was willing to do whatever

it took to get you up off your ass

and on the way to California...

There's a big difference.

CARRIE

Brian I want him out of our car!

BRIAN

Why, what did he do?

CARRIE

Brian get him out of the car. Next

gas station either he leaves or I

do!

CARRIE

Twenty dollars in the tank and a

carton of cigarettes.

NEWSMAN

...the ex-mental patient with a

history of arrests is still at

large...

ATTENDANT

Here's your cigarettes...

ATTENDANT

...And change. Better be careful,

looks like a bad one coming. Where

you headin'?

CARRIE

California.

ATTENDANT

Hear it never rains there. Must be

nice.

NEWSCASTER

...we would like to repeat...

NEWSCASTER

...there is a nationwide manhunt

for...

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

...is believed responsible for the

murders of his landlord John

Diebold...

NEWSCASTER

...of the fatal stabbing and robbery

of Mr. Joseph Davies Robbins...

NEWSCASTER

If you see this man...

EARLY

I ain't ridin' in no bus... bitch.

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

...call your local police or FBI...

EARLY

You just sit there and keep your

mouth shut.

EARLY

I knew that boy'd have a hogleg here

somewhere.

EARLY

Get over here.

EARLY

Sit your ass down in that corner.

ADELE

Early, what're you doin'?

EARLY

Go back to the car and keep Brian

there. I don't want him in here...

(beat)

Do it Adele... Now!

EARLY

What's your name, boy?

ATTENDANT

(very scared)

Walter Livesy.

EARLY

Think. I might just have to kill you

Walter. How do you feel about that?

ATTENDANT

Not so good. You sure you have to?

EARLY

I don't know. Wish I did.

CARRIE

Early, just think...

EARLY

Shut your mouth.

BRIAN

Adele, what are you doing back here?

ADELE

...Lost my purse... Could you help

me look for it? It's probably under

the seat.

EARLY

Where you from Walter?

ATTENDANT

(nervous shake)

Vernon, Florida.

EARLY

Never heard of it, any huntin'?

ATTENDANT

Turkey mostly.

EARLY

Turkey's are real smart. Smarter

than most people think...

EARLY

Tell you what Walter, you lie down

there now... You make sure you stay

put for a while after we leave...

Okay?

ATTENDANT

...Mind if I hold that Bible?

EARLY

What do you need a Bible for?

EARLY

You think I'm goin' to kill you.

Well that'd make me a liar then

wouldn't it?

ATTENDANT

No sir.

EARLY

Here you go.

EARLY

(mumbles to himself)

I wonder if Adele would like one of

these?

(beat)

Nah...

BRIAN

What was that?

EARLY

(surprised at the

feathers)

What the fuck!

BRIAN

Carrie, what's wrong?

(to Early)

Early, we went through this already,

you have to leave.

EARLY

(spits out a feather)

'Fraid not Bri'... Drive Adele.

EARLY

Hate to be an Indian-giver but I'm

gonna have to ask for my gun back.

BRIAN

(to Early)

What happened back there?

CARRIE

He shot him in the head... oh God!

ADELE

(raising her voice)

He did not, you liar. Take that back.

CARRIE

He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking

insane.

EARLY

Everybody just shut up!

EARLY

You two just cooperate and do what I

say, and we'll all arrive safe and

sound in California, as planned...

unless, of course, Adele don't kill

us first with her driving.

EARLY

What the hell is this stuff?

ADELE

It's Chinese food. It was the only

place open. You said you was starving,

you'd eat anyth...

EARLY

Yeah but, what is it?

ADELE

I don't know, they didn't speak too

good English.

EARLY

And just what exactly are the Chinese

doing here in the middle of the

American desert anyway?... Didja get

the beer?

EARLY

..."Chink" beer!

EARLY

Oh hell, I'm sorry Bri. Adele, honey,

untie Brian, he's starving over there.

(pause)

Carrie, you want some?

EARLY

Where's the damn forks and spoons

at!

EARLY

...Is it just me, or has this whole

trip been goin' downhill ever since

we ran outta Lucky Lager?

BRIAN

(quietly)

How many people have you killed Early?

EARLY

Well now, how many people d'you see

me kill?

BRIAN

None.

EARLY

...Well then, that's how many I

killed.

BRIAN

(unconvincingly)

If you say so.

EARLY

Damn right I do.

EARLY

You never killed anyone have you

Bri'?

EARLY

You never even seen anybody killed,

right?

BRIAN

What are you getting at?

EARLY

You wanna tell me how'n the hell you

gonna write a book 'bout somethin'

you don't know nothin' 'bout?

EARLY

Ya see what I'm sayin'?

(beat)

Ha!

BRIAN

(nervously mimes the

same)

...Ha.

EARLY

(a nod toward the

carry out container)

...watch out for that stuff, it bites.

BRIAN

(recollecting to

himself)

...way too much MSG.

ADELE

Smile.

EARLY

No way. I guarantee you he was

breathing when I walked outta there.

EARLY

Hey... Ain't we getting near the

next murder site... Bri?

BRIAN

Forget about it, doesn't matter.

EARLY

Hell it don't...

(beat)

...Hand me Brian's map there Adele.

One day I'm gonna pass some store

and see your book in the window. Me

and Adele gonna buy a copy for our

coffee table.

EARLY

Figured your hands might be starting

to hurt.

EARLY

Let's have a look. You girls coming?

ADELE

Can I just wait here?

EARLY

Don't worry Bri', I'll take the

pictures.

(to Adele, with a

kiss to her cheek)

...you stay here with Carrie.

(to Carrie)

You run off... Bri' pays the price.

Karma, remember?

ADELE

This is called walk the dog.

EARLY

So tell me... what happened here?

BRIAN

Two brothers, prospectors, lived

here. Up until a few years back.

EARLY

(coaxing)

...and?

BRIAN

They picked up hitchhikers... young

men... and brought them back here.

EARLY

Where'd they do it?

EARLY

Bri.

EARLY

This ain't going to give me

nightmares, is it?

ADELE (O.S.)

This is one of my favorites... rock

the cradle.

BRIAN

...They asked them just before they

were executed why they did it. They

said "to be famous."

(beat)

Why do you do it?

EARLY

Do what Bri?

BRIAN

We both know you didn't have to kill

that gas station attendant.

BRIAN

You wanted to.

(beat)

Why?

BRIAN

It make you feel good? Powerful?

(Flash!)

Superior, what? Come on Early, tell

me something.

(Flash!)

Were you angry?

BRIAN

(tentative)

Who are you angry with Early... your

mother, your father?

EARLY

You want to know about my daddy,

I'll tell you about my daddy, Bri...

CARRIE

Adele, listen to me... Early's sick;

he should be in a hospital.

CARRIE

(shouting over the

music)

The police are after him, he's a

murderer!

ADELE

(uncertain)

...That's not true.

CARRIE

(shouting)

What?

ADELE

(shouting back)

That's not true!

MALE OFFICER

Let's take a look.

FEMALE OFFICER

I'll call in the plate.

CARRIE

(shouting)

...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . .

I saw him kill that man.

ADELE

(defensive)

Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't

do that. I don't know why you're

saying those things. You ain't my

friend.

ADELE

Please don't say anything Carrie.

FEMALE OFFICER

We got a match, I'll call for back

up.

MALE OFFICER

All right ladies, I want both of you

to slowly step away from the ca...

POLICE RADIO

Officer needs help, shots fired, six

Adam five, one eighty-seven, suspects

wanted in multiple murders. Location

unknown, last seen...

EARLY

Tell me that don't hurt.

EARLY

Shoot him. You'll be doing him a

favor.

BRIAN

No, no, I can't.

EARLY

(No,) It's the answer to all them

questions of yers.

EARLY

Now you'll never know.

BRIAN

...Don't do it. Early, look at him,

look at his face. That's not your

father.

EARLY

I know that. That there is a policeman

in a world of pain. And this is what

you call a mercy killin'.

EARLY

I'm still waiting.

EARLY

(disappointed)

Not so much as a simple "thank you."

ADELE

(empty)

...thank you.

EARLY

Thank you for what?

(becoming aggravated)

What are you thanking me for Adele?

ADELE

(hesitantly, she admits)

...I don't know.

EARLY

Well Adele... it was for...

(screaming at her)

...saving your fucking life back

there!

EARLY

(gesturing with his

fingertips a fraction

apart)

Darlin' you were 'bout that far from

spendin' the night at the morgue.

You understand?

CARRIE

He wasn't going to shoot her, you

murdering son of a bitch!

BRIAN

Carrie... stop it.

CARRIE

(explodes)

What the fuck is wrong with you

Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes

for once and open your eyes... you'll

see that he is a homicidal fucking

killer. He is... for real!

BRIAN

Shut up Carrie, please... just shut

up!

ADELE

...I luv' cactuses 'cos they're so

strong. Don't need much care really.

ADELE

(far away)

...You can forget about 'em forever

and then look at 'em and they're

doin' even better than before.

BRIAN

(watching the house)

Adele... we gotta do something before

Early kills someone else.

ADELE

...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em.

They can live for two even three

hundred years.

BRIAN

Adele for god sake please lis...

ADELE

(she glances over to

Brian)

There ain't nothing we could do.

Once Early sets his mind on somethin',

well thats the end of that.

MRS. MUSGRAVE

(to herself)

It's just like in that dream I had.

If only I had seen their faces.

ADELE

(tries to cheer Mrs.

Musgrave up)

You've got beautiful cactuses here,

I just love 'em. My momma used to

keep a garden.

EARLY (O.S.)

(from the kitchen)

Hey Bri... You ever stop to think

that if you switched the two letters

in your name...

(entering the room)

...it would spell Brain.

EARLY

What's wrong with her?

ADELE

(sorry for her)

She had a dream that somethin' like

this was gonna happen.

EARLY

I'll bet she did.

EARLY

Where's your husband?

MRS. MUSGRAVE

(lying)

...I'm a widow.

MR. MUSGRAVE

(excited)

Is that you Peaches? Come, you must

see Saturn tonight. The rings are

sensational!

MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.)

My oh my, this is quite rare, quite

rare indeed. Come have a look...

MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.)

Peaches?

BRIAN

(whispers to Carrie)

You gotta talk to her. She looks up

to you, she'll listen to you.

CARRIE

I tried talking to her at the mine.

It didn't work.

BRIAN

Then try again, (it's our only

chance.)

ADELE (O.S.)

Early?

ADELE

(excited)

Early, Mrs. Musgrave has the most

beautiful little guest house out

back and... well, no one's stayin'

in it... it's just empty. And she

said if me and you wanted to, well

maybe we...

EARLY

(to Mrs. Musgrave)

Well 'Peaches'... you're a widow

now.

EARLY

(to Brian)

Have you seen this one? That don't

leave much to the imagination now

does it?

EARLY

(smiles and shakes

his head in disbelief)

That's you ain't it?

CARRIE (O.S.)

You're right Early...

CARRIE

...It is me. Do you like it?

ADELE

Go on now... please.

ADELE

(in a whisper)

...Call me.

EARLY

Well they say there's room fur all

kinds in California... and that's

where we're gonna be this time

tomorrow. California.

(beat)

Adele honey?

EARLY (O.S.)

Adele?

EARLY

(shouting)

Peaches! Come on back here. There

ain't nothin' for you to be afraid

of.

EARLY

(shouting over the

gunfire)

Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!

ADELE

Early! Stop!!

EARLY (O.S.)

Oww! Oww!! -- FUCK!!!!

EARLY

(perplexed)

Honey... What do you think you're

doin'?

EARLY

Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying

'bout? I'm the one got hit.

ADELE

I changed my mind, Early. I'm not

gonna climb up that Hollywood sign

with you... I decided. I think your

mean, and you hurt people.

BRIAN

Carrie, watch for Early.

CARRIE

What are you going to do?

BRIAN

I'm going to try and lift the end of

the piano. If I can... slide your

cuffs free.

CARRIE

What about you?

BRIAN

I don't know.

CARRIE

Can you lift it again? Just lift it,

hurry.

EARLY

You two been busy in here.

BRIAN

What happened to Adele?

EARLY

Well, let's put it this way.

(beat)

I need me a new woman.

EARLY

Sorry about this Bri...

CARRIE

(desperate)

Early, don't.

CARRIE

I'll do whatever you want. You want

me to go with you, I'll go with you.

Just don't kill him.

EARLY

Think anyone will notice?

EARLY

I'll bet there's a 'door' out there...

save us some time.

EARLY

Pass me a beer hon'.

EARLY

You wanna hit me with that, huh?

CARRIE

(not looking at him)

No.

EARLY

Stop lyin'... I can see right through

you.

EARLY

Who d'ya think you're foolin'?

(beat)

I know you better than you think...

CARRIE

(confused)

...You're hurting me...

EARLY

I seen the way you been lookin' at

me since we met... Snappin' my photo

when you thought I wasn't lookin'.

Wanting me...

EARLY

I saw you when I killed that boy...

EARLY

(whispers)

You were plenty hot.

CARRIE

(explodes)

You sick twisted fuck! You don't

know shit about me.

EARLY

Sick... some people might say takin'

photos of me and Adele humpin' in

the back of the car is sick.

EARLY

...You know what I mean?

CARRIE

...I know I'd love to smash this

bottle right in your fucking face.

EARLY

That's better... Honesty... I like

that in a woman.

EARLY

But I'll tell ya... when we get to

California, we're gonna have to do

BRIAN

Carrie... Carrie... it's over.

EARLY

Go ahead Bri, ask me something.

(beat)

You wanna know how I'm feeling'?

Well I'd say I'm feelin' pretty damn

good.

EARLY

How 'bout you? You feelin' good?

EARLY

good.

(beat)

Or maybe you're feelin'... powerful.

That it, you feeling powerful?

Superior? I know I am.

EARLY

What? Am I angry with my daddy? Now

why would I be angry with my daddy...
