GET CARTER

Screenplay by Mike Hodges

Based on the novel

Jack's Return Home by Ted Lewis

Revised Draft, 1971

GERALD

(removing the cigar

from his mouth)

Bollock naked with his socks still

on?

SID

(thoughtfully)

They do that up North.

GERALD

What for? Protective purposes?

SID

Ask me?

GERALD

Ask Jack. It's his old stamping

ground.

SID

Must be a bloody contortionist

GERALD

We don't want you to go up the

North, Jack.

JACK

No.

GERALD

(groans)

Not suede boots!

SID

Knock it off, Gerald.

GERALD

What? And get the clap?

GERALD

You work for us, Jack. We have

connections in those parts.  I'd

hate you to screw 'em up.

GERALD

What's that? A python.

GERALD

What are you going for?

JACK

To find out what happened.

GERALD

Some hard nuts operate up there,

Jack. They won't take kindly to

someone from London poking his

bugle in.

JACK

Too bad.

GERALD

I smell trouble, boy.

SID

The law was satisfied.

JACK

Since when was that good enough?

GERALD

Think again, Jack.

JACK

I will.

CARTER

Pint of bitter.

CARTER

In a thin glass.

BARMAN

Is there a Mr Carter in the room?

CARTER

Yes.

CARTER

Hello?

(pause)

Margaret?

(pause)

Why the hell aren't you here?

(he lights a

cigarette.)

What time?

(pause)

Is Doreen at the house?

(pause)

Who's with him then?

(pause)

When can I see you? Will you be

there tomorrow?

(pause)

Now listen, Margaret...

CARTER

I won't be using the room tonight.

EDNA

(stops and turns)

I see.

CARTER

I'm staying with a friend.

EDNA

(continuing up the

stairs)

Her husband docks tomorrow, does

he?

CARTER

(smiles)

It's not like that, luv.

EDNA

It never is.

EDNA

Are you a traveller?

CARTER

(smiling)

Definitely.

EDNA

(surveying the room)

Will this do?

CARTER

(looking around)

Very nice. (He takes his wallet

out.) I'll pay you for tonight as

well.

EDNA

Don't be bloody silly. You're the

first since Monday.

CARTER

You sure?

EDNA

Ta.

CARTER

(feeling the mattress)

I'll bet this one's seen some

action.

EDNA

I'll give you the key when you

come down.

CARTER

Was he in bad shape?

UNDERTAKER

They come worse.

CARTER

Doreen?

CARTER

All right, are you?

CARTER

Been staying with a friend?

CARTER

Sorry about your father.

DOREEN

(pause)

Yeah.

CARTER

Tell me, Doreen, did the police

say anything?

DOREEN

(dazed)

They said he was drunk.

CARTER

How's school?

DOREEN

I left last year.

CARTER

Oh, what you doing now?

DOREEN

Working at Woolworths.

CARTER

That must be interesting.

DOREEN

Yes.

CARTER

What you going to do? Live with

Margaret?

CARTER

Well, why won't you come with us

to South America? My fiancee won't

mind,

(pause)

Your dad would have wanted it.

UNDERTAKER

(to colleague)

Get Hughbert up, will you?

(to Carter)

We're ready now, sir.

EDDIE

We weren't sure where it was taking

place, like.

CARTER

Nice of you to come.

EDDIE

No. Frank was a good bloke.

KEITH

He was that.

EDDIE

One of the best.

KEITH

I couldn't believe it when I heard.

Carter is suddenly attentive.

CARTER

What?

KEITH

I mean, I was surprised when he

didn't turn up for work.  He was

always on time.

CARTER

Did you work with him, Keith?

KEITH

At the Half Moon.

EDDIE

(not to be left out)

It's a bloody funny thing. You

know a bloke for six bloody years

and all the time he's as calm as

gentle Jesus...

(pause)

...then he goes and does a thing

like that.

(he shakes his head.)

It's a bloody funny thing.

CARTER

(quietly)

Yeah. A bloody funny thing!

CARTER

(whispering to Doreen)

Is that Margaret?

CARTER

Margaret.

MARGARET

Changed me mind.

MARGARET

Everyhing go off all right?

CARTER

Fine...

(pause)

I want to talk to you.

MARGARET

What about?

CARTER

Doreen.

MARGARET

(adamantly)

She's nothing to do with me.

CARTER

(puzzled)

What do you mean? You've been

Frank's bird ever since her mother

cleared off. You're closer to her

than anyone.

MARGARET

(shaking her head)

No. No. It's not like that. I've

got a husband, you know.

CARTER

Hold it!   Hold it!

(looking her in the

eye)

Who killed Frank, Margaret?

MARGARET

(nervously)

Killed?  I don't know anything

about it.

CARTER

Really.

MARGARET

I must go. I'm in a hurry.

CARTER

I want to talk to you later.

MARGARET

I can't.

CARTER

Tomorrow morning, then?

MARGARET

Well, all right then. Twelve o'clock

on the Iron Bridge.

EDDIE

Absent friends.

(He raises his glass

and drinks, then

continues

thoughtfully.)

You don't think he might have done

it on purpose?

KEITH

What? You mean, like, kill himself?

KEITH

Naw. Frank? Kill himself? You what?

KEITH

I mean, what for?

CARTER

That's what I was wondering.

KEITH

Come off it. Frank was... well...

straight. He had no worries I know.

Hell, we worked together every day

for a year. It would have showed.

CARTER

Why would it?

KEITH

It just would. He was always the

same.

CARTER

Since when did he drink whisky?

KEITH

Don't know.

CARTER

Nobody seems to know.

EDDIE

(finishing off his

drink)

Bloody good bloke. One of the best.

DOREEN

(blurts out)

How would you know?

(She suddenly jumps

up and empties her

glass in Eddie's

face.)

Or you?  Or you? None of you knew.

I knew. He was me dad.

CARTER

Let her go. She'll be OK.

(to Eddie)

Sorry about that.

EDDIE

(wiping his face

with a handkerchief)

Don't worry. She's bound to be

upset.

CARTER

(to Eddie)

Have another?

EDDIE

No. I'll be off now. I should be

at work.

CARTER

Look, look.

(He peels off a

note.)

Get your suit cleaned.

EDDIE

No. It's all right.

CARTER

(standing, pushes

the note in his

top pocket)

Thanks for coming.

EDDIE

Frank was a good bloke. It's the

least I could have done.

CARTER

You work here, Keith?

KEITH

Yes.

CARTER

Keith, if anybody comes in here

and asks for me, you let me know.

Right?

KEITH

Right.

CARTER

I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the

dance hall.

(He casts an eye

around the bar.)

Do you know a man called Albert

Swift?

KEITH

Yeah. He comes in here a bit.

CARTER

Where would I find him?

KEITH

Today? At the races. He always

goes.

KEITH

How'd you know Albert?

CARTER

Went to school with him.

(smiles)

He was leader of our gang. He'll

know what's going on in this town.

CARTER

Grey suits you, Eric.

ERIC

Good God!

CARTER

Is he?

ERIC

Jack Carter.

CARTER

(amused)

Eric. Eric Paice.

ERIC

What you doing around here then?

CARTER

Didn't you know this is my home

town?

ERIC

No, I didn't know that.

CARTER

Funny, that.

ERIC

Thanks. So what're you doing? On

your holidays?

CARTER

No. I'm visiting relatives.

ERIC

Oh, that's nice.

CARTER

It would be. If they were still

living.

ERIC

Meaning what?

CARTER

A bereavement. A death in the

family.

ERIC

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

CARTER

That's all right, Eric.

ERIC

Well, well. Small world, isn't it?

CARTER

Very...

(pause)

So, who you working for these days

Eric?

ERIC

Oh, I'm straight.

(indicating uniform)

Respectable.

CARTER

(smiling)

What are you doing? Advertising

Martini?

ERIC

Oh, you've been watching television.

CARTER

Yeah,

(pause)

Come off it, Eric. Who is it?

CARTER

Brumby?

CARTER

Kinnear?

ERIC

What's it to you anyway?

CARTER

I've always ad your welfare at

heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm

nosy.

ERIC

That's not always a healthy way to

be...

CARTER

And you should know, if I remember

rightly.

CARTER

So you're doing all right then,

Eric. You're making good.

ERIC

Making a living.

CARTER

Good prospects for advancement, is

there? A pension?

(He can't resist it

any longer. He

lifts the sunglasses

off Eric's nose

and looks into his

eyes.)

Do you know, I'd almost forgotten

what your eyes looked like.

CARTER

They're still the same. Piss holes

in the snow.

ERIC

Still got a sense of humour?

CARTER

Yes, I retained that, Eric.

(He moves towards

the saddling ring

and turns to Eric.)

Do you know a man called Albert

Swift, Eric?

ERIC

Can't say I do.

CARTER

Don't miss the start on my account.

RAY

Carter's here.

ERIC

Where?

RAY

I don't know.

ERIC

You stupid shit!

KINNEAR

You see what it's like these days,

Jack.  You can't get the material.

CARTER

Yes, I can see your problem, Mr

Kinnear.

KINNEAR

Sit down, Jack,

(pause)

I could weep. I really could.

Sometimes I think I'll retire.

Just piss off to the Bahamas and

let somebody else employ them,

(to girl)

Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is

it, Jack?

CARTER

(to Glenda)

Scotch, please.

KINNEAR

(to bouncer)

Piss off, Ray.

KINNEAR

Eric told me of your bereavement.

CARTER

Yep.

KINNEAR

Do you know, I never knew he worked

in one of my places!

CARTER

No? Funny that. Neither did I.

KINNEAR

If I'd known, I'd have fixed him

up with something better.

CARTER

Yeah.

KINNEAR

Nasty way to go.

CARTER

Yes.

HARRY

Are we here to play cards or talk

about the old days?

KINNEAR

Harry! Jack, I don't want to be

rude, but these men have brought a

lot of money with them. Glenda,

you don't offer a man like Jack a

drink in those piddling little

glasses.  Give him the bloody

bottle.

(He picks up his

cards.)

Now, where are we?

KINNEAR

Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.

HARRY

(shaken)

You're bluffing, you bastard!

KINNEAR

That's what you pay to find out.

Right, Jack?

CARTER

Right. If you can afford it.

HARRY

(to Carter)

Thought you were going soon.

CARTER

Soon. When you've lost your money.

Won't take long.

HARRY

Clever sod, aren't you?

CARTER

Only comparatively.

KINNEAR

Harry, I don't like to push, but

could you let us know how much

your hand's worth?

GLENDA

You know Sid Fletcher?

CARTER

What?

GLENDA

You know Sid Fletcher?

CARTER

I work for him.

GLENDA

Do you?

CARTER

(amused)

Yes, I do.

HARRY

What's that? A hundred?

KINNEAR

That's right, Harry.

HARRY

Your hundred, and another hundred.

HARRY

What's that?

KINNEAR

That, Harry? That's another hundred -

twenty-five pounds notes of the

realm.

HARRY

Three hundred altogether?

KINNEAR

Three hundred altogether, Harry.

GLENDA

I know him too.

CARTER

Who?

GLENDA

Sid Fletcher.

CARTER

(sending her up)

Oh, do you?

GLENDA

(dumb)

Yes.

CARTER

No, do you really?

KINNEAR

I'll follow that and go two hundred.

KINNEAR

You can always see me, Harry.

HARRY

All right. Two hundred.

KINNEAR

(raises an eyebrow)

Ha.

GLENDA

Yes. I met him last year.

CARTER

Go on.

GLENDA

Oh yes. When he came up on business.

CARTER

Really?

GLENDA

He came to see Mr Kinnear.

CARTER

No.

HARRY

(panicking)

What's that?

KINNEAR

That's six hundred pounds, Harry.

Two hundred to follow you, and

I've raised it four hundred.

HARRY

Four hundred?

KINNEAR

That's right.

HARRY

You're not seeing me?

KINNEAR

No.

HARRY

I'll see you, then.

KINNEAR

Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?

GLENDA

We went about together.

CARTER

Really?

GLENDA

Yes, while he was here.

CARTER

While he was here. You went about

together?

GLENDA

He was here for four days.

CARTER

Was he?

GLENDA

Could you do me a favour?

CARTER

Yeah, I'll do you a favour.

GLENDA

Could you please put my glass on

the table?

KINNEAR

Oh, come on, Harry. I haven't won,

have I? Go on, you're pulling my

leg.

KINNEAR

How about that, Jack?  Old Harry

thought I was having him on.

HARRY

Shut up.

KINNEAR

Not going, Jack?

CARTER

I have to. Things to see to.

KINNEAR

Of course, of course. Well, any

time, just drop by.

CARTER

Yeah, I'll do that.

(He points at Harry.)

Told you it wouldn't take long,

didn't I?

ERIC

Jack! I didn't like that.

CARTER

You should have told me who you

were working for.

ERIC

Cyril didn't like it, either.

CARTER

Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls

together, is it?

ERIC

He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't

like it much when they hear you've

been sticking your nose in.

CARTER

He's right. Tell him to save the

cost of the phone call.

BILLY

(suspicious)

What do you want?

CARTER

What happened to this car?

BILLY

What's it got to do with you?

CARTER

This is my brother's car.

BILLY

Oh ay?

CARTER

Yeah.

BILLY

Well, he drove it into the river.

CARTER

Was the steering faulty?

CARTER

What about the brakes?

BILLY

Fine. Nowt wrong with them.

CARTER

How'd it happen, then?

BILLY

He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.

CARTER

Was he?

KEITH

What you having, Jack?

CARTER

Large Scotch.

KEITH

Heard of a man called Thorpe?

CARTER

Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a

long time.

KEITH

(picking up Carter's

money)

That's what he was saying about

you.

KEITH

Said he'd heard you were up in

town. Wondered if I knew where you

was staying. Wanted to look you

up. Old time's sake.

CARTER

That's nice. What'd you tell him?

KEITH

Nowt.

CARTER

Good lad.

CARTER

See you later.

KEITH

Where you off to?

CARTER

(smiling)

Las Vegas.

CARTER

(gently)

You all right now?

DOREEN

Yeah.

CARTER

You coming to South America?

DOREEN

No.

CARTER

Where you going to live, then?

DOREEN

At me friend's house.

CARTER

Where's that?

DOREEN

Wilton Estate.

CARTER

Nice family, are they? Church-goers

and all that?

CARTER

Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't

suppose I'll see you again.

(He pulls out a wad

of money, and peels

off some notes.)

There. Go and get your hair done.

DOREEN

(Can't believe it)

Thanks.

CARTER

Be good. And don't trust boys.

EDNA (O.S.)

That was left for you this evening.

EDNA

What is it?

CARTER

My brother, Frank.

EDNA

Is he staying the night?

CARTER

Funny.

(He puts the casket

on a side table.)

Can I phone London?

EDNA

It'll cost you.

ANNA

Hello.

ANNA

How I miss you.

(She stretches

herself out sexily

and smiles.)

Stop it, darling.

CARTER

(looking at Edna)

I fancy you. I wish I was touching

you right now...

CARTER

...making love to you. I want to

stroke you and kiss you all over.

Where are you?

ANNA

In the bedroom.

ANNA

My black underwear.

CARTER

(quietly)

The sexy, silk ones?

CARTER

Take your bra off.

(pause)

No, go on.

CARTER

Now hold them. Gently.

CARTER

Slowly. Imagine it's me.

CARTER (V.O.)

When we're in South America, we'll

make love in the sun. Roll over...

and make love again... and again...

For me... I fancy you...

GERALD

What's the matter? You got gut

trouble or something?

ANNA

No, darling. Just doing some

exercises,

(into telephone)

Listen, Janet, Gerald's just got

in, so I must ring off.

(pause)

Yes. Yes. I'll come tomorrow.

CARTER

Save it till Sunday. I'll be back

then.

CARTER

That'll be for me.

KEITH

Thorpey. They were waiting for us

in the car park.

CARTER

How many?

KEITH

Four of them.

THORPE

Jack?

CARTER

Good evening.

THORPE

I'd like a word with you, Jack.

CARTER

That's nice.

THORPE

Confidential, like.

CARTER

You stay in the car. I'll come and

listen. (

(He leaves the

darkness and walks

to the car.)

What you want to tell me, Thorpey?

THORPE

I've been asked to give you this.

THORPE

Train goes at four minutes past

twelve. You've just got time.

CARTER

That's very kind of somebody. Who

do I have to thank? (pause) What

happens if I miss the train?

THORPE

I've been asked to make sure you

don't.

CARTER

Oh, really. You're getting very

optimistic in your old age, aren't

you, Thorpey?

MAN

Let's stop pissing about.

THORPE

Are you coming, Jack? It'd be best.

THORPE

Right lads.

CARTER

(roars)

Thorpe!

CARTER

Time's up, Thorpey.

CARTER

Hello, Keith,

(pause)

Stay there, Thorpey.

EDNA

What the bloody hell do you think

you're at?

CARTER

(smiles)

I'm sorry.

EDNA

You don't look it.

CARTER

No. Really, I am.

EDNA

Don't come that bloody flannel

with me. If you're a traveller,

I'm bloody Twiggy.

(She points at

Thorpe.)

And who's he?

OLD WOMAN

What's going on? Have you no thought

for others?

CARTER

We're going inside.

EDNA

Inside? Why should I give house-

room to your sort?

CARTER

Up the stairs, Keith. The door on

the right.

OLD WOMAN

Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot.

Everybody knew there'd be trouble

when you moved in.

EDNA

You keep your trap shut, Ma.

OLD WOMAN

I'll send my old man to see you!

EDNA

And wouldn't he love it!

EDNA

Where do you think you're going?

CARTER

Why don't you go and make us all a

nice cup of tea?

EDNA

And what you going to do?

CARTER

Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll

tell you. I might even let you

watch.

EDNA

I'll call the police.

CARTER

(He knows she fancies

him)

No, you won't.

CARTER

Well now, Thorpey. It seems I've

got a secret benefactor.

(He moves into the

room and opens his

briefcase, which

is lying on the

bed.)

It's nice to know that. Isn't it,

Keith?

(He takes out a

bottle of whisky.)

There's only one trouble, I don't

know who to thank.

CARTER

Now, I want to know who it is,

Thorpey.

CARTER

All right. If you like, Thorpey,

we'll stop mucking about.  Somebody

doesn't want me poking my nose

into something and I happen to

know what that something is.

(pause)

Now stand up.

CARTER

Who paid you to see me off?

THORPE

I can't Jack. How can I?

CARTER

Yes you can.

THORPE

No, don't Jack, don't.

CARTER

Who sent you, Thorpey?

THORPE

(desperate)

Brumby!

CARTER

There you are, you see. Now you

could, couldn't you?

(pause)

And quickly.

CARTER

Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea

set.

KEITH

Who's Brumby?

CARTER

Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?

CARTER

Ever been into an arcade there and

put a penny in the slot machine?

KEITH

Yeah.

CARTER

Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff

Brumby, and like as not the bloody

arcade as well. Right along the

coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?

CARTER

Where's he living these days?

THORPE

He's got a new place at Burnham.

CARTER

Address?

THORPE

On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.

EDNA

(furious)

Suppose you tell me what the bloody

hell's going on. It's my house,

you know.

CARTER

Yes, Edna, and I must say you've

been great about the ...

EDNA

Stick the soft soap. Let's be having

it.

THORPE

Can I go now?

CARTER

You must be joking,

(to Keith)

Keep him away from the telephone.

I'm going out for a bit.

EDNA

Now just a minute...

CARTER

Ta-ra.

THORPE

Don't let on I told you, for God's

sake.

BRUMBY

Jesus wept!

MRS BRUMBY

Now, Cliff, don't get mad.

BRUMBY

I'll murder the little bitch!

MRS BRUMBY

Cliff ...

SANDRA

Daddy!

BRUMBY

That's right, bloody Daddy.

SANDRA

I wasn't expecting you until three

o'clock.

BRUMBY

And this is what you call having a

few friends back for coffee, is

it?

BRUMBY

Running bloody riot over my bloody

furniture, drinking my bloody

booze...

BRUMBY

... spewing over my fucking

goldfish.

MRS BRUMBY

Cliff ...

BRUMBY

Shut up, Phyllis.

(He walks back into

the house.)

Sandra!

BRUMBY

Sandra! Unlock the door, you bitch.

CARTER

Good evening.

MRS BRUMBY

(standing)

Who are you?

CARTER

I'm an old friend of Cliff's. I

want to see him.

CARTER

It's urgent.

MRS BRUMBY

What's it about?

CARTER

Business.

MRS BRUMBY

I know all about Cliff's business.

CARTER

Yeah, well, tell him the Fletchers

sent me.

BRUMBY

What the bloody hell's all this?

BRUMBY

You know what the bloody time is!

(pause)

It's two o'clock in the bloody

morning!

CARTER

I know.

BRUMBY

Well?

BRUMBY

The wife says the Fletchers sent

you.

BRUMBY

What's so bloody important it

couldn't wait till the morning?

BRUMBY

Listen, I'm not in the mood for

bloody silly buggers.

CARTER

I made a mistake.

BRUMBY

What?

CARTER

I made a mistake.

BRUMBY

What about?

CARTER

Never mind.

BRUMBY

It's not business?

CARTER

See you.

BRUMBY

Listen, I don't like it when some

hard nut comes pushing his way in

and out my house in the middle of

the night.

BRUMBY

Bloody well tell me who sent you.

CARTER

You're a big man, but you're in

bad shape. With me, it's a full-

time job. Now behave yourself.

CARTER

Good night, Mrs Brumby.

EDNA

You sod.

CARTER

They came back?

EDNA

(sarcastically)

No.

EDNA

Look at this. You bastard.

EDNA

You don't care a stuff, do you?

CARTER

I'll buy you another.

EDNA

What about the lad? They took him

away.

EDNA

What'll they do to him?

CARTER

Don't ask me.

EDNA

They bloody hurt me.

CARTER

You're lucky. They kill as well.

EDNA

(mocking him)

And what about you? Did you kill

Brumby?

EDNA

Thorpey nearly died laughing.

CARTER

That little shit!

EDNA

What about Keith?

CARTER

What about Keith?

EDNA

What you going to do?

CARTER

Pension him off.

EDNA

You're a bastard.

CARTER

(angry)

What am I supposed to do?  I don't

know where they've taken him. Do

you?

CARTER

So shut up.

EDNA

What's that gun doing in your room?

Suppose I phoned the police and

told them there's a bloke staying

in my hotel who's planning to shoot

somebody?

CARTER

You wouldn't.

EDNA

How'd you know I wouldn't?

CARTER

(smiling)

'Cos I know you wear purple

underwear.

EDNA

What's that supposed to mean?

CARTER

Think about it.

EDNA

Are you awake?

CARTER

No.

EDNA

Do you want breakfast?

CARTER

You must be joking. I never eat

breakfast,

(pause)

Did you sleep well?

EDNA

Uh-huh.

EDNA

Did you sleep well?

CARTER

Yes, thank you.

CARTER

Are you tired?

EDNA

No. Are you tired?

CARTER

No. I'm not tired,

(pause)

Do you eat breakfast?

CON (O.S.)

Put us in it, Jack.

PETER

Don't let us interrupt you, Jack.

CARTER

I might have guessed.

CON

Sorry about this. But there you

are. Orders are orders.

CARTER

And what orders would they be,

Con?

CON

Gerald phoned us in the middle of

the night, said he'd heard you've

been making a nuisance of yourself.

PETER

We've got to take you back to

London.

CON

He said it'd be doing him a big

favour.

CON

We know why you're all steamed up,

and so do Gerald and Sid.

PETER

But they have to be diplomatic.

CARTER

Right. Now take me back to London.

CON

(smiling)

It'd be best if you got dressed

first.

CON

Put it away, Jack. You know you

won't use it.

PETER

The gun he means.

CARTER

Out.

PETER

If Anna could see you now.

CARTER

Out.

CON

Now, Jack. Be reasonable. You know

we're going to take you back -

sooner or later.

CARTER

Out.

CON

Mind you don't catch cold.

PETER

I hope she's got understanding

neighbours.

CON

See you when you've got your drawers

on.

CARTER

Do us a favour?

EDNA

What, and get myself beaten up

again?

CARTER

No chance of that.

EDNA

Not much.

CARTER

They're friends of mine.

EDNA

And that'll make me feel better?

CARTER

I don't want to get rough, do I?

CON

Hold it! Where do you think you're

going?

CARTER

Strawberry Fair.

CARTER

In.  Turn right.

(He points the gun

at the coalshed.)

Open that door.

CARTER

And go inside.

EDNA

What you going to do?

CARTER

I'm going to sit in the car and

whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.

EDNA

You coming back?

CARTER

How could I stay away?

PETER

Where were you, then?

CON

Bollocks.

CARTER

Keith in?

SHAMIR

(shouts)

Keith.

CARTER (O.S.)

Which is his room?

CARTER

What happened to you, then?

KEITH

How'd you find me?

CARTER

Did they give you a rough time?

KEITH

No.

(He lowers his head

to the pillow.)

You bastard. You knew they'd come

back.

CARTER

No, I didn't,

(pause)

Does Albert Swift still live over

the ferry?

KEITH

Get knotted.

CARTER

All right. All right. I want to

square things with you first.

KEITH

Oh yes? How?

KEITH

Stuff it! My girl friend's coming

from Liverpool tonight.  Nice

surprise, isn't it?

CARTER

I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a

course in karate.

KEITH

Frank said you were a shit and he

was bloody well right.

KEITH

You even screwed his wife, didn't

you?

KEITH

The poor bastard didn't even know

if the kid was his.

CARTER

How were things between you and

Frank?

MARGARET

He was all right to me.

CARTER

Nothing more? Just another feller?

MARGARET

Nicer than most.

CARTER

But he was just another feller,

wasn't he?

MARGARET

Yes.

CARTER

Though nicer than most?

MARGARET

Yes. I can't help the way I am.

CARTER

(ignoring the

statement)

Why'd you see him so regular?

MARGARET

Once a week?

CARTER

I call that regular.

MARGARET

He was gentlemanly. I like that.

CARTER

Once a week you like a gentleman?

MARGARET

(angrily)

Look, I'm me, right. You're not.

We are what we are, like it or

not.

(She turns and walks

slowly along the

bridge.)

Why all the bloody needle?

CARTER

What was bugging Frank?

MARGARET

He wanted me to leave Dave and

marry him. Last Friday I told him

it wouldn't work. Dave would have

killed us both!

(pause)

He followed me home and kicked up

a stink in the street,

(pause)

I had to tell Frank I couldn't see

him any more. It was getting too

dodgy. That was on Sunday.

(She stops and looks

over the bridge.)

He said he'd kill himself. I was

frightened what you might do.

CARTER

I don't believe you, Margaret.

Frank wasn't like that.

(pause)

I'm the villain in the family,

remember?

MARGARET

It's the truth.

MARGARET

It is. Honestly.

CARTER

(shouting)

You bloody whore. Frank was too

careful to die like that. Who killed

him?

MARGARET

I don't know nothing.

CARTER

Listen, the only reason I came

back to this craphole was to find

out who did it. And I won't leave

until I do. You understand?

CON

Hello, Jack.

CARTER

You bitch! It was you who told

them I was here, wasn't it?

CON

Peter's very upset about his car.

He's going to shit all over you.

CARTER

I'll catch up with you later,

Margaret.

PETER

(shouts above the

revs)

Come on, get in.

GLENDA

Over here, Jack.

GLENDA

You didn't know you had a fairy

godmother, did you?

CARTER

No. I didn't know that.

GLENDA

A fairy godmother, all of your

own. Aren't you lucky?

CARTER

So where are we going, Princess?

GLENDA

To the demon king's castle, of

course.

CARTER

Of course. Where else?

CARTER

How'd you know where I'd be?

GLENDA

You were seen parking your car.

The demon king waves his wand and

I was dispatched to bring you to

him. Lucky for you I waited.

CARTER

Very lucky, I should think. You're

drunk!

GLENDA

Nasty.

CARTER

He must have been pretty sure I'd

come.

GLENDA

Oh, he was. He told me a magic

spell that would make you come.

CARTER

(smiling)

And what was that?

GLENDA

We're there now.

BRUMBY

A new venture of mine. It's going

to be a restaurant.

(pause)

Do you like it?

CARTER

Yes.

BRUMBY

Last night, after you'd gone, I

did a little bit of asking around.

Seeing as you weren't very

forthcoming,

(pause)

It seems that you are concerned

about the death of your brother?

(pause) I got to thinking it would

be nice if the bloke you were after

was the same bloke I wanted off my

back,

(pause)

You know my life. Machines. The

arcades. Nice business. Looks after

itself. People put money in. I

take it out. Not much rough stuff.

It's a business that makes me very

happy. But recently, I've had a

spot of bother,

(pause)

One of my lads gets a bit over-

anxious and flogs some machines in

a club that's already got some.

The upshot is I've had to eat shit

and stop flogging my machines to

other clubs.

(pause)

So far as I'm concerned, that's

it. Apparently not. These people

I've offended get the idea that it

would be good to take over my whole

outfit,

(pause)

So I'm worried. I can't fight them

I haven't that kind of set-up.

But I've got to fix them before

they fix me. Trouble is, if I try

and they find out, I'm dead.

BRUMBY

Five grand. It belongs to you.

Along with a little name I'm going

to give you.

CARTER

What name?

BRUMBY

Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.

(pause)

Kinnear did it.

CARTER

Why?

BRUMBY

I don't know. All I know is that

people were shitting bricks up at

his place last Saturday. Your

brother's name was mentioned. Next

day, he was dead.

CARTER

Why?

BRUMBY

I don't know. That's all I was

told.

CARTER

That's not good enough.

BRUMBY

Christ, what...

CARTER

(shouting)

Do me a favour. You don't really

expect me to fix Kinnear on your

say-so?

(pause)

Just because they tried to get me

on you last night, don't think you

can pull the same trick. Stroll

on.

BRUMBY

Jack, you're wrong.

CARTER

Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter

exits.

BRUMBY

Jack...

CARTER

(looking around)

Who's setting you up in this place?

GLENDA

Brumby.

CARTER

Is he coming here?

GLENDA

Don't worry. He's meeting the

architects at the restaurant.

CARTER

Aren't you scared Kinnear will

find out?

GLENDA

He won't. He thinks I'm simple.

CARTER

What does he want that bloody great

country place for?

GLENDA

(knowingly)

Entertaining.

CARTER

What kind of entertaining?

GLENDA

Now you're asking.

CARTER

Does Brumby get a kick out of that

crap?

GLENDA

(giggling)

Especially when I play the lead.

CARTER

Did Kinnear say anything? After

I'd left the other night?

GLENDA

That's why you waited for me.

CARTER

(kissing her on the

neck)

Not entirely. No.

GLENDA

You sure about that?

CARTER

Sure I'm sure.

GLENDA

You bastard.

CARTER

I want to give you an Oscar.

GLENDA

(laughs)

You've been watching the film.

CARTER

Tell me about the girl.

GLENDA

What girl?

CARTER

The young girl. Who pulled her?

GLENDA

I don't know.

CARTER

Was it Albert?

GLENDA

Shouldn't think so.

CARTER

Is it one of Kinnear's films?

GLENDA

Yeah.

CARTER

Who set it up?  Eric?

GLENDA

Yeah.

CARTER

Then he must have pulled her.

GLENDA

Expect so.

CARTER

Did my brother Frank find out?

GLENDA

Your brother? What you talking

about?

CARTER

You're a lying bitch.

CARTER

Now tell me the truth.

GLENDA

The girl's name was Doreen. That's

all I know.

CARTER

And you didn't know her last name?

GLENDA

No.

CARTER

Well, it's Carter. That's my name,

(pause)

And her father was my brother. And

he was murdered last Sunday. Now

get up and get dressed.

CARTER

Get in.

CARTER

Where's Albert?

CARTER

Where's Albert?

CARTER

I know where I'll find him.

GIRL (V.O.)

Eric, he's come for Albert,

(pause)

I don't know, (pause) On the ferry,

I reckon.

CARTER

Hello, Albert.

ALBERT

Hello, Jack,

(snivelling)

I don't know anything, Jack.

CARTER

Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll

kill you.

ALBERT

I know. I know.

CARTER

Do you want to go to the toilet,

Albert?

CARTER

Do you want to go to the toilet,

Albert?

CARTER

You can't get away from me, Albert.

ALBERT

I know.

ALBERT

For Christ's sake, give us a fag.

ALBERT

I didn't know who Doreen was.

Thought she was just another bird.

CARTER

Did Eric Pake pull her?

ALBERT

Yes.

CARTER

How?

ALBERT

I dunno. He's got his ways. He

knows Margaret.

CARTER

When did you find out?

ALBERT

A couple of weeks back.

CARTER

How?

ALBERT

No choice. I had a visit from

somebody.

CARTER

Who?

ALBERT

Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film.

He wanted to meet Doreen.

CARTER

And you told Brumby?

CARTER

Who killed Frank?

CARTER

Do you want to be dead, Albert?

ALBERT

Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and

two of his boys arrive with Frank

and tell me that he's rumbled.

Somehow, he's seen the film and

was about to shoot his mouth off.

They ask me for some whisky and

start forcing it down his throat.

(pause)

I thought they'd just duff him up

a bit. Honest.

CARTER

What did you do?  Albert?

ALBERT

Nothing. What could I do?

CARTER

Did Eric know that Frank was my

brother?

ALBERT

Yes. I told him.

CARTER

What did he say?

ALBERT

'Good.'

CARTER

Is that all there is?

CARTER

Then that's it, Albert.

ALBERT

Jack, for Christ's sake ...

CARTER

You knew what I'd do.

ALBERT

(crying)

Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't

kill him.

CARTER

I know you didn't kill him.

(and again.)

I know you didn't.

ERIC

No shooters. Cyril said no shooters,

you stupid bastard.

PETER

Get stuffed.  He's reloading.

CON

Gerald wants to see him first.

PETER

Shut up.

CARTER

(shouting)

Are you coming in? Or do we piss

about all day?

ERIC

You're finished, Jack. You know

that, don't you? I've bloody

finished you.

CARTER

Not till I'm dead, Eric.

ERIC

Oh, you've still got your sense of

humour?  Tell him how I've fixed

him, Con.

CON

He's told Gerald about you and

Anna.

ERIC

Didn't believe us at first, did

he, Con? Then Peter talked to him.

PETER

Didn't even say goodbye. Just asked

us to take you back - alive.

ERIC

He's probably talking to her right

now. Are you still going to fancy

her when Gerald's finished with

her face?

CARTER

Stay where you are, Peter.

PETER

(screaming)

Don't.

ERIC

Carter, your car needs a wash.

BRUMBY

I don't want them cooking in here.

You can put a hatch in that wall.

INTERIOR DECORATOR

Yes, it's all a question of ...

BRUMBY

Who in Christ's name is that? It's

a bloody madman.

BRUMBY

Jack!

CARTER

You shouldn't have shown the film

to Frank.

BRUMBY

I had to. It was the only way I

could get at them.

CARTER

The guy on the swing-bridge?

(pause)

OK.

FIRST WOMAN

They don't know how it happened.

SECOND WOMAN

How far did he fall?

FIRST WOMAN

What did Betty say... Ninety floors,

I think it was.

SECOND WOMAN

Really. Was he dead?

FIRST WOMAN

Oh, yes.

SECOND WOMAN

Better to go quick like that.

CARTER

I've come for you, Margaret.

ERIC

Gerald Fletcher wants a word with

you Cyril.

KINNEAR

Hello, Gerald.

CARTER

It's Carter. Listen carefully, you

hairy-faced git. I've got the film

and enough evidence to put you

away for a long time. All it takes

is one call to the police.

KINNEAR

Really?

(pause)

So?

CARTER

I'll do a simple deal with you.

All I want is ...

KINNEAR

I see. I think that can be arranged.

CARTER

... but I don't want him there

until six in the morning.  OK?

(pause)

Right.

ERIC

You want something, Cyril?

KINNEAR

Yes, Eric. A word with you.

CARTER

Get out.

CARTER

Take your clothes off.

CARTER

Keep your pants on.

(pause)

Lie down.

KINNEAR

I want you to listen very carefully.

Jack Carter,

(pause)

You know what he looks like?

MAN

Yes.

CARTER (V.O.)

Police.

CARTER

(calling out)

You couldn't win an egg and spoon

race, Eric.

ERIC

(wheezing)

Sod off.

CARTER

Stay away from the car or I'll

blow you apart.

CARTER

(panting slightly)

Stand up, Eric. Stand up.

CARTER

I bet you could use a drink, could

you, Eric?

CARTER

Eh? Have a drink.

ERIC

Still got your sense of humour.

CARTER

Drink up, Eric. Drink up. I want

you to drink all of that. Do you

understand? Drink up. Just like it

was with my brother, Frank. Go on,

son. Drink up.

CARTER

Drink up, Eric.

CARTER

It was you who poured it down him.

Eh, Eric?

CARTER

Did you all have a good laugh, eh?

Did you have a good laugh when he

was spewing it up? The whisky is

pouring all over Eric's face and

suit.

CARTER

Drink it! Drink it! Did you all

pass the bottle round after the

car went over the top?

CARTER

Don't stop, Eric.

CARTER

Goodbye, Eric.

FADE OUT:
