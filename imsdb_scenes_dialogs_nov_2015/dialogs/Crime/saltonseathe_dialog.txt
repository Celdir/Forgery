THE SALTON SEA

by

Tony Gayton

FADE IN:

DANNY (V.O.)

My name is Tom Van Allen ...

(beat)

or Danny Flynne ...

DANNY (cont'd)

... I don't know anymore.

(beat)

Maybe I'll let you decide.  Maybe you

can help me, friend.  As you can see,

I don't have a hell of a lot of time left.

DANNY (cont'd)

Avenging angel ... Judas Iscariot ...

Loving husband ... Prodigal Son ...

The prince of Denmark ...?

DANNY (cont'd)

All of these? None of these? You

decide, friend.  You decide. Trumpet

player? Speed freak?

(beat)

Speed freak.

(beat)

That's as good a place as any.

(beat)

But first, a little background on the

mad world of the tweaker ..

FADE OUT.

FADE IN.

DANNY (V.O.)

Methedrene was first distilled by a

Japanese scientist before WWII.

Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a

good thing when they saw it.

DANNY (V.O.)

This guy's so tweaked, he probably thinks

he can survive this without a scratch.

DANNY (V.O.)

Maybe not.

(beat)

By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese

population had a meth problem after

the war: factory workers, soldiers,

pilots.  Maybe that's why it took two

bombs to get 'em to surrender.  A

nuclear blast is just a minor

nuisance to a determined tweaker.

DANNY (V.O)

In the fifties, the housewives got

ahold of it.  Dexedrine. Benzedrine.

Methedrene ...

DANNY (cont'd)

Now that's a classic speed freak for

you, skinny and cleaning the house.  I'll

bet her poor husband never knew what

hit him in the sack either.

DANNY (V.O.)

There were even rumors that one of

our presidents dabbled with

mysterious "energy shots".  Imagine

that: a slammer in the White House.

DANNY (cont'd)

If it's true, I'll bet ol' Krushchev

never got a word in edgewise.

DANNY (V.O.)

By the late 60's the government

finally cracked down and sent the

whole thing underground.  Bikers

controlled the market for a while.

DANNY (V.O.)

But now anyone with a basic chemistry

kit and the right ingredients can

cook it up at home.

DANNY (V.O.)

Ever see a long-haired tattooed freak

buying up all the cold medicine he

can lay his hands on at three in the morning.

DANNY (cont'd)

Take it from me, he ain't got no

cold.  He's a cook.  Look in his

kitchen and you'll find a whole

grocery list of unsavory ingredients.

DANNY (V.O.)

Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid,

match heads for red phosphorus,

ether and of course the cold

medicine .. that's for Ephedrene,

soon to become Methedrene

DANNY (cont'd)

This guy's a regular Julia Child.

Problem is, I'll be even Miss Julia

fucks up the bouillabaisse from time to time.

DANNY (cont'd)

Oh-oh.

NANCY

It ain't right

TERESA

You think?

NANCY

Something's off.

TERESA

We can do better.

KUJO

So the alphabet, I mean look at it,

there's 26 letters.  Why not 27 or 28

or 106?  And the vowels: a, e, i, o, u.

What the hell is up with that?

CREEPER

And sometimes y.

KUJO

What I'm saying is that I love it!

It's great. I could go on all night about it.

KUJO (cont'd)

Let's take every letter individually.

I mean, let's really break the

mother's down.

DANNY (V.O.)

And so this is where I find myself.

No. I should choose my words more

wisely: this is the world I sought

out.  The land of the perpetual night-

party.  Day swallowing night and

night swallowing day.  The crank

compressing time like some divine

piston on its awesome downstroke.

DANNY (cont'd)

We've been at this for three days ...

or is it four?  Tweakerrs, lokers,

slammers coming and going, swearing

eternal allegiance and undying love

for one another, only to wake up

after the binge and realize you

wouldn't walk across the street to

piss on one of 'em if their head was on fire.

(beat)

Is it three days or is it four?

DANNY (cont'd)

I know what you're thinking. But

don't give up on me just yet.  And

for God's sake, don't pity me. Don't

make any judgments until you've seen

my whole story.

(beat)

And keep your eyes open.

(beat)

Nothing is what it seems.

KUJO (O.S.)

OH SHIT! WE'RE OUT OF DRUGS!

DANNY

How the hell did we get this detail?

JIMMY

Guess it's our turn.

DANNY

What time is it?

JIMMY

Twelve

DANNY

Midnight?

DANNY

Where to?

JIMMY

I know a guy.

DANNY

Lead the way.

JIMMY

Nice day

DANNY

I hadn't noticed.

(beat)

I've seen you around.  What's your name?

JIMMY

Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.

DANNY

Why's that?

JIMMY

My features. They're Finnish.

DANNY

You don't say.

JIMMY

Finland is a country.

DANNY

Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.

JIMMY

Bobby?

BOBBY

Shhh.

BOBBY (cont'd)

(whispering)

They're coming.

JIMMY

(likewise whispering)

What?

BOBBY

The spiders.

BOBBY (cont'd)

(sing-song)

I'm ready for you this time.

BOBBY

Aha! Yeah!

(super rapid-fire)

You thought you could fuck with

Bobby, you thought you could fuck

with Bobby, you thought you could

fuck with Bobby!

BOBBY (cont'd)

With Bobby you thought you could fuck?

BOBBY (cont'd)

Who the fuck are you?

JIMMY

It's me ... Jimmy

BOBBY

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.

JIMMY

Yeah.

BOBBY

What can I do for you?

JIMMY

Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.

BOBBY

Don't pay her no mind.

BOBBY (cont'd)

Shut the hell up, goddamit!

BOBBY (cont'd)

I got no vocation skills!  What the

fuck you want from me?

(keeps slapping)

I got no vocation skills!

JIMMY

Hey man, take it easy.

BOBBY

What?

JIMMY

Come on.  Ease off the girl.

BOBBY

Did you bring the plastic men?

BOBBY (cont'd)

Did you bring the plastic men?

(beat)

Did you bring the plastic men?

BOBBY

Did ... you ... bring ... the ... plastic ... men?

DANNY

Nah, we didn't bring 'em.  That's

just your good crank talking, brother.

DANNY (cont'd)

We were hoping to catch a few ourselves

if you'll hook us up.

BOBBY

(calmer)

You bring the plastic men?

DANNY

Like I said.

JIMMY

Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.

BOBBY

Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ...

(he draws a blank)

DANNY

Hobby?

BOBBY

That's a good man. I like that.

DANNY

(calmly)

Hey, Bobby, look .. What you got

going with your old lay, it's none

of our business. We're just a couple

of dope fiends trying to score.

BOBBY

Two eight balls?

DANNY

Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.

JIMMY

Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced.

He wouldn't have did nothin'

DANNY

C.I. number 678-43K-107

(beat)

Tanner and Garcetti

DANNY

(lying on the back seat)

I've got a hot one.

TANNER

You go, boy.

DANNY

If it's all the same to you, I'd

rather not dish right here in the

middle of Crankville.

TANNER

Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?

DANNY

Well, you know what they say, just

because you're paranoid, doesn't mean

everyone's not out to slice your

balls off and shove 'em down your throat.

TANNER

You got a name?

DANNY

Bobby, rhymes with hobby.

TANNER

What?

DANNY

Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of

jailhouse tatts.

TANNER

No last name?

DANNY

It was all pretty informal.  Didn't

have a lot of time to exchange

pleasantries.

GARCETTI

This the guy?

DANNY

It speaks!

DANNY

That's him.  He's a lot prettier in

person though.

GARCETTI

Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.

DANNY

Dude is bugging.  Transparent

spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.

GARCETTI

What's he holding?

DANNY (O.S.)

Couple of eightballs, maybe more.

DANNY (cont'd)

Cheap ass techno knockoff in the

drawer with extra mags.

DANNY (cont'd)

12 gauge in the closet.

TANNER (O.S.)

Any company?

DANNY (O.S.)

Alas, the lovely Mrs. Bobby was

playing the bologna in a Posturpedic sandwich

(beat)

And there was a kid.

TANNER (O.S.)

A kid?  Are you sure?

DANNY

Yeah. Pretty sure.

(beat)

Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.

TANNER

God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.

DANNY

Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.

DANNY (cont'd)

Hey Tanner ... you be careful, okay?

TANNER

Danny, I'm touched.

DANNY

Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.

GARCETTI

Then why didn't you help the kid when

you were there?

DANNY

Hey, you want me to do all your work

for you, numbnuts?

GARCETTI

I'll tell you why you didn't help -

because you're a chickenshit tweaking

snitch.  You're a bottom feader,

Flynne.

DANNY

Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.

DANNY

You're welcome.

DANNY

(approaching)

Let me help you with those.

DANNY (cont'd)

(loud through the door)

And to think Miss Manner was

living down the hall from me and I

didn't even know it!

DANNY (cont'd)

Hey, you left a can of ...

DANNY (cont'd)

... some Chinese looking shit out here.

DANNY (cont'd)

I'll just leave it by the door here.

(beat)

I'm going now!

DANNY (cont'd)

You really oughta be more careful.

This is not a good neighborhood.

WOMAN

I was rude. I'm sorry.  I'm kinda new around here.

DANNY

You did the right thing.

(handing the can over)

What is this stuff anyway?

WOMAN

Fermented soybean curd.

DANNY

Yummy.

DANNY (cont'd)

My name is Danny Flynne.

(off her silence)

And you are?

WOMAN

Colette Aragon. Thank you, Danny.

DANNY

My name is Tom Van Allen

(beat)

I play the trumpet.

DANNY (cont'd)

(distant)

My name is Tom Van Allen. I play the trumpet.

DANNY (cont'd)

My name is Tom Van Allen and I play the trumpet.

LIZ

That's so ...

(not finishing the word)

DANNY / TOM

Melancholy?

LIZ

Yes, it hurts my heart.  What a

beautiful composition.

DANNY/TOM

And the performance?

LIZ

(goofing)

A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN

is nothing short of dazzling in his

interpretation of Miles Davis'

haunting, moody piece.

DANNY/TOM

Thank you.  Thank you very much.

LIZ

And he has a really hot ass with hardly

any hair on it.

DANNY/TOM

Again, I thank you.

LIZ

I was talking about Miles.

DANNY/TOM

You, madam, are a heartless wench.

LIZ

And you've got wiener breath.

DANNY/TOM

Really?

LIZ

It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.

LIZ

(laughing)

Tom! Gross!

DANNY/TOM

You know how I make that song

melancholy when I play it?

I think of what my life would be like

without you.

LIZ

Tom, let's spend the night here.

DANNY/TOM

There's no motels around here.

LIZ

No.  Right here on the beach.  Come

on. Let's do it.

DANNY

(at the vanity, whispering)

Okay, we'll stay.  We'll stay.

DANNY/TOM

(on the beach)

Come on, Liz. We'll get eaten alive.

DANNY

(at the vanity, softly)

No ... We'll stay.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN.

DANNY

You think I'm a Judas?

TANNER

Hard to compare the people you're

taking down with the Lord.

DANNY

Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.

TANNER

Garcetti thinks everything is shit.

He doesn't even like dolphins.

TANNER (cont'd)

I'm serious.  He hates 'em.  You ever

hear of anyone who didn't like dolphins?

DANNY

Thanks for not judging me.

TANNER

It's not my place.

DANNY

Don't you wonder why I do it?

TANNER

The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself

out of jail? I know the drill.

DANNY

You don't find that repugnant?

TANNER

Just the way the world works.  Look,

as far as tweakers go, you aren't a

bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but

yourself as far as I know.

DANNY

Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.

TANNER

Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could

have gone quietly but he played the

hard-ass con till the end. And as

far as I'm concerned, he wife and

kid are a hell of a lot better off

without him.

(beat)

Now take the money.

TANNER (cont'd)

One think I do want to know is how

the hell did you get yourself into

this position to start with?  You

seem like a smart enough guy.

DANNY

It's a long story.  Maybe I'll tell

you all about it some day.

DANNY (cont'd)

Hey, Garcetti ... You ever get

confused and try to flush yourself?

Garcetti

(all business)

You tell him?

TANNER

I was getting to it.

DANNY

(to Tanner)

Tell me what?

GARCETTI

I'll tell him.

DANNY

(worried)

Tell me what?

GARCETTI

(mock concern)

Danny, it's really pains me to have to

tell you this, but do you remember

DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us

put away for trafficking a few months back?

DANNY

Yeah.  What about him?

GARCETTI

Turns out he's connected.

DANNY

To who?

GARCETTI

The Mexicali Boys

DANNY

And what does this have to do with me?

GARCETTI

He knows somebody ratted him.

DANNY

What?!

GARCETTI

And he's making a lot of noise about

having his homies hang a Colombian

necktie on whoever it was.

GARCETTI (cont'd)

You know that thing where they slit

your throat and pull your tongue out

of the hole.

GARCETTI (cont'd)

Apparently they call it a necktie

because it hangs down about yay long

and looks very similar to a tie.

Isn't that weird, Danny?  Isn't that

weird?

DANNY

Shut up, Garcetti!

DANNY

If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.

TANNER

Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's

you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must

have sold to hundreds of different people.

TANNER (cont'd)

And if you're that worried about it,

maybe you ought to get out of town.

DANNY

How the hell am I gonna do that?  You

guys are still stringing me a long on

that possession charge.

GARCETTI

(mock surprise)

You mean that hasn't been cleared up yet?

DANNY

Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this

for almost a year. I've done

everything you guys have asked of me.

GARCETTI

Anyone ever ask you to be such a

disrespectful smart-ass all the time?

TANNER

Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.

DANNY

When?

TANNER

Soon. I promise.  We'll get the

charges dropped and you can

disappear.  In the mean time, trust

me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.

DANNY

(checking out the painting)

Ride 'em cowboy)

BUBBA

(southern twang)

You like that?

DANNY

Who wouldn't?

BUBBA

First rate, ain't it?

DANNY

It's downright classy is what it is.

DANNY (cont'd)

You consider my presentation?

BUBBA

Get in, hoss.  We'll talk it over.

DANNY

Jimmy, you don't look so hot.

JIMMY

I'm hurting.

DANNY

You on a roll?

JIMMY

Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train

right now, man.  You got anything for

me?

DANNY

Sorry.

JIMMY

Why does it have to feel so bad?

DANNY

You're brain is in reverse mode ...

cutting off your supply of dopamine.

Here.  Have a beer.

DANNY (cont'd)

You see the crank bugs?

JIMMY

Oh yeah.

(guzzles some beer)

Man, Danny, how do you keep your shit

together so tight?

DANNY

That's a good one.

JIMMY

I'm serious, dude.  You always seem

to be on top of things, even when

you're tweakin'.

DANNY

I guess there's just no substitute

for good genes.

DANNY (cont'd)

You hear about Bobby?

JIMMY

Yeah, it's a pity.  Truly a pity.

JIMMY (cont'd)

He was a good supplier.

(gets an idea)

You think maybe there's any drugs

left in his room?  You know, like

hidden?

DANNY

I kind of doubt it, Jimmy.

JIMMY

So, why'd you want to see me?

DANNY

Business.  I need to leave town and I

find myself in dire need of some cash.

JIMMY

See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.

DANNY

What?

JIMMY

You. You're smooth. You use words like dire

and shit.  You got language skills, man.

DANNY

Don't get carried away.

JIMMY

I find myself in dire need of some cash.

DANNY

You remember that guy you told me

about ... said he could handle a big

hook-up?

JIMMY

Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time

cook. I'm talking dire.

DANNY

I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a

quarter's worth.

JIMMY

A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...

DANNY

A quarter of a million, Jimmy.

JIMMY

Fuuuuuck

DANNY

Can your man handle that?

JIMMY

I think so.  I mean, we'd have to

talk to him.

DANNY

Can you set that up?

JIMMY

Sure.

JIMMY (cont'd)

What's in it for us?

DANNY

I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from

my man if I can get the right price.

JIMMY

10%.  That's ...

DANNY

25 grand.  You introduce me to your

boy, I'll cut you five grand out of

my take.  That's all you gotta do,

just get me in the door.

KID

DANNY

Jimmy, where do you find these people?

JIMMY

The Del Ammo Mall mostly.

JIMMY

You wanna score some go-fast?

DANNY

Not tonight.

JIMMY

Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?

DANNY

Personal protection. It's a

dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a

very dangerous world.

DUDE

(sees Danny eyeballing him)

You mad dogging me, Bitch?

DANNY

Heavens no. I was just admiring your boots.

DANNY

Did you purchase them locally?

DANNY (cont'd)

Goodbye now. Nice meeting you.

DANNY

You know, Jimmy, you might as well

put a sign on the back of this thing

asking the cops to pull you over.

JIMMY

You mean, like to throw 'em off?

DANNY

Yeah, that's what I mean.

(beat)

Where the hell does this guy live anyway?

JIMMY

Palmdale

DANNY

Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?

JIMMY

I think on account of his nose.

DANNY

You're going to have to explain that

one.

JIMMY

He doesn't have one.

DANNY

You're going to have to give me a little

more than that, Jimmy.

JIMMY

Well, you know how Winnie the Pooh

always got his nose stuck in the honey jar?

Well, Pooh-Bear snorted so much

crank, they had to cut his nose off.

He's got a plastic one though.

JIMMY (cont'd)

You know, they say he hasn't slept in

over a year.

DANNY

You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?

JIMMY

No

(beat)

You think she's a tweaker?

POOH-BEAR

Okay, here we go gentlemen ...

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

Zapruder?

ZAPRUDER

Ready.

POOH-BEAR

Oswald?

OSWALD

Roger that.

POOH-BEAR

Grassy knoll?

GRASSY KNOLL

Ready

POOH-BEAR

Third shooter?

POOH-BEAR

President Kennedy waving to the

crowd, his lovely wife looking

radiant beside him as they turn into

Dealey Plaza ...

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

Stand by, gentlemen.  Stand by ...

(beat, eyes widening)

Steady .... steady ... FIRE!

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

Yes!  Yes!

(beat)

Out! That's a wrap.  Good job, boys. Good job.

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

(to Danny and Jimmy)

So? What do you think?

DANNY/JIMMY

(ad-libbing)

- Cool.

- Yeah. Interesting.

POOH-BEAR

(holding up the camera)

I'm gonna get this developed and send

it to the Warren Commission.

DANNY

Um, I think the Warren Commission has

been closed for a while.

POOH-BEAR

No shit?

(thinking)

Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then.

He'll get them to reopen the bastard.

OSWALD (O.S.)

Pooh-Bear! We got a problem.

OSWALD (cont'd)

J.F.K.'s still alive.

(beat)

Should I finish him off?

POOH-BEAR

So, Danny, Jimmy tells me you have a

proposition for me.

DANNY

Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's

looking for about a quarter's worth.

POOH-BEAR

Crank or glass?

DANNY

The good stuff.  Can you handle that?

POOH-BEAR

I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?

DANNY

No, I'm good.

POOH-BEAR

I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.

DANNY

Not bad.

POOH-BEAR

Secret recipe.

DANNY

Can we talk price?

POOH-BEAR

Make me an offer.

DANNY

I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?

POOH-BEAR

I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None

of that faggot metric crap for me.

DANNY

Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.

POOH-BEAR

(enthusiastic)

Hey, okay.

DANNY

You're serious?

POOH-BEAR

Anything for a dear friend.

DANNY

But I just met you.

POOH-BEAR

But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I

think of you as a brother already.

DANNY

So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?

POOH-BEAR

If you say so.

DANNY

Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude,

but I get the feeling you aren't

taking me seriously.

POOH-BEAR

Maybe you're the one who isn't taking

me seriously.

DANNY

Why do you say that?

POOH-BEAR

I welcome you here with open arms and

you got the nerve to low-ball me like

some slick used car salesman.

DANNY

Hey, I was just trying to ...

POOH-BEAR

(never losing his smile)

I want to tell you about the last guy

who tried to jam me up on a deal.

DANNY

Hey, I don't play that.

POOH-BEAR

I'm sure you don't.  At least I'm

sure you think you don't.  Anyway, I

want to tell you. It's a good story,

guaranteed to break the ice at a party.

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

Dude shorted me eleven dollar ...

thought I wouldn't count it till I

got home.  Wrong.

(beat)

You know what I did?

(beat)

I clamped his head in a vice.

POOH-BEAR (V.O.)

You should have heard him howling.

POOH-BEAR

Then I took a Saws All and I cut

His skull open

POOH-BEAR (V.O.)

(calmly)

You know, those Saws All really do

cut through everything.

DANNY

Look, you don't have to ...

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

So I'm standing there looking at this

dude's brain and I'm thinking to

myself, you know, this guy doesn't

really need this thing. I mean,

anyone stupid enough to jam me up

doesn't really use their brain to

begin with. You know what I'm

saying?

(beat, dead serious)

So I took it.

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

Hell, I make better use out of it

than he ever did.  Got it up in my

freezer. I take it out from time-to-

time, mix a little of it up in my

dinner ....

(looks at the plate of eggs)

... of breakfast.

POOH-BEAR

10,000 a pound

DANNY

Now you're insulting me.  Nice

talking business with you.

POOH-BEAR

9,000.  Take it or leave it.

DANNY

I'll leave it.  Eight is as high as

I'll go.  See ya'.

POOH-BEAR

All right, all right. Don't get your

knickers in a knot. I can live with eight.

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

You got a deal.

POOH-BEAR

God damn, Danny, you got some nerve.

Pooh-Bear respects that.

(beat)

Oh, by the way ...

POOH-BEAR

(in the grocery store)

Hmm. Good price.

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

You want to stay for lunch?

JIMMY

You want a hit?

DANNY

No. I'm good.

JIMMY

Can I ask you something?

DANNY

Sure, Jimmy.

JIMMY

What does J.F.K. stand for?

DANNY

John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

JIMMY

Was he the president?

DANNY

Yes, Jimmy

JIMMY

Danny?

DANNY

Yes, Jimmy.

JIMMY

Thanks for not laughing at me.

OLD MAN

(softly, a la Perry Como)

Sugar Plum Fairy never once gave it away.

Everybody had to pay and pay ...

KUJO

Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ...

my wife's pimp knows a guy who works

at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're

getting a very special delivery a

week from this Friday.

JIMMY

What is it, drugs?

KUJO

Better than drugs.

KUJO

Bob Hope's stool specimen

(beat)

We're gonna boost it.

DANNY

Why in God's name would we want

to do that?

KUJO

So we can sell it.

DANNY

To who?

KUJO

I don't know.  A collector.  Fuck

Danny, it's Bob Hope.

CREEPER

He is a national treasure.

KUJO

Check it out.  This is the lab.

CREEPER

What is that?

KUJO

It's the lab.

CREEPER

I mean what kind of drink?

KUJO

Cuba Libre

JIMMY

What is that? Rum and coke?

KUJO

Don't worry about it.

JIMMY

I just want to be straight on the

details.  Can I taste it?

KUJO

No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking

lab! Now shut up.

KUJO (cont'd)

Danny, come on. If I'm gonna let you

in on the opportunity of a lifetime,

the least you can do is pay

attention.

KUJO (cont'd)

This is the courier

CREEPER

You should use something smaller.

He's the same size as the office. It

doesn't ring true.

OLD MAN (O.S.)

And the colored girls sing doot-de-doot ....

KUJO (O.S.)

He delivers at four o'clock on the

nose every Friday.  Alpha team will

be in the elevator with the courier.

That'll be Danny and Creeper.

KUJO (cont'd)

Every member of the team will be

equipped with night vision goggles, a

police scanner and two-way radios.

KUJO (cont'd)

... number two team, which will be

me and Jimmy, will be positioned in

the stairwell at the other end of the hall.

KUJO (cont'd)

With alpha team following from the

elevator, number two team will

approach from the stairwell, cutting

the courier off before he reaches the lab.

KUJO (cont'd)

Facing superior numbers and an array of high-tech weapons,

the courier will have no choice but to comply with our demands.

KUJO

Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.

JIMMY

I thought you were done.

OLD MAN

I said hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side ...

KUJO (cont'd)

Now here's the beautiful part.  The

getaway.  Both teams will rappel

right down the center of the

stairwell, change clothes and walk

right out the front door like nothing

happened.

KUJO

So what's it gonna be, Danny boy?

You in or out?

KUJO (cont'd)

Danny!

DANNY

(watching Colette)

I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on

this one, boys.

DANNY

You okay?

She nods.

DANNY (cont'd)

Well...good night then.

DANNY (cont'd)

Why are you out here?

COLETTE

Quincey, my boyfriend... he kicked me out.

DANNY

Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I

really don't want to get involved.

COLETTE

I understand. Thanks anyway.

COLETTE

Thanks.

COLETTE (cont'd)

I'm so embarrassed.

DANNY

Don't be.

COLETTE

Jesus, I look like a raccoon.

DANNY

I was thinking Alice Cooper.

COLETTE

Oh God.

DANNY

Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.

COLETTE

How?

DANNY

I don't know .... you could be staking

your financial future on stealing Bob

Hope's stool specimen.

DANNY (cont'd)

See. No matter how bad things are,

there's always someone a little worse off.

COLETTE

What about the guy on the very bottom?

DANNY

Leave me out of this.

COLETTE

That bad, huh?

DANNY

Nevertheless, I still try to see

the glass as half-full.

DANNY (cont'd)

Problem is, it's usually half-full of

something that tastes a  lot like urine.

COLETTE

Could be worse.

(beat)

Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.

DANNY

Ouch.

DANNY (cont'd)

Hey, did I mention that I was a coward?

DANNY (cont'd)

Quincey. You sure he isn't gonna

come looking for you?

COLETTE

Don't worry, he's probably passed out

with his head in the toilet by now.

DANNY

This man sounds like a real catch.

COLETTE

Oh, he's a keeper all right.

DANNY

Colette ...

COLETTE

What?

DANNY

Nothing.

COLETTE

Go ahead.

DANNY

Look, it's really none of my business

but why don't you just dump this guy?

COLETTE

It's not that easy.

DANNY

Don't tell me, down deep he's really

not a bad person and you don't want

to see him get hurt.

COLETTE

Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce

Brothers?

(beat)

I hate the son-of-a-bitch.

DANNY

Then leave.

COLETTE

I can't.

DANNY

Why not?

COLETTE

You don't understand.

DANNY

There's nothing to understand.

The guy is a pig.

COLETTE

I can't leave.

DANNY

You get off on abuse or

something?

COLETTE

Fuck you.

DANNY

Then why don't you leave?

(beat)

Just give me one good reason.

COLETTE

Because he'll kill me.

COLETTE (cont'd)

Is that simple enough for you?

DANNY

Why don't you call the cops?

COLETTE

Why? They don't hold him for more

than a day or two.

DANNY

That's long enough to get out of town.

COLETTE

I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives

with my parents.  Quincey knows where

they live.

DANNY

Then make sure he gets put away for longer.

COLETTE

How?

COLETTE (cont'd)

Tell me how.

DANNY

I don't know.

(beat)

Let me think about it.

BUBBA

(Texas drawl)

I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten

thousand.  We'll see how it goes.

DANNY

Why? The guys is ready to deal now.

BUBBA

Because I don't know him and I don't

really know you, partner.

DANNY

Now that's down-right insulting.

BUBBA

I'll have to live with that.  My money

my risk, my rules.

DANNY (O.S.)

(filtered, broken)

I guess I don't have a hell of a lot

of choice.

BUBBA (O.S.)

(filtered)

Get used to it.  You're in a very

tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.

GARCETTI

You thinking what I'm thinking?

TANNER

Yeah.  This could be the one we're

looking for.

TANNER

Hold it right there, Flynne.

DANNY

Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack!

DANNY

What the hell are you doing here?

TANNER

Question is, what are you doing here?

DANNY

I was trying to score some dope.

TANNER

Cut the shit, Flynne.

DANNY

Someone want to tell me what the hell

is going on here?

TANNER

Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.

DANNY

(serious)

What did I do?!

DANNY (cont'd)

This is a joke, right?  You put him

up to this, Garcetti?

DANNY (cont'd)

Come on Tanner ... don't ...

TANNER

(shrieking, failing)

You think this is funny motherfucker?

DANNY

(still laughing and covering up)

I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like

a fucking girl.

DANNY

Garcetti, do something.

GARCETTI

We know what's going on.

DANNY

(in pain)

I still don't know what you're

talking about.

GARCETTI

Okay, let me help you.  You're setting

up a deal with a Chinese redneck.

Quarter of a million.

GARCETTI (cont'd)

We just listened to the whole thing.

GARCETTI (cont'd)

Somebody tipped up, dipshit.

DANNY

Jimmy?

GARCETTI

Who the hell is Jimmy?

DANNY

He's the only one I told.

GARCETTI

And he probably only told two people

and they probably only told four

people and on and one. You know

better than to tell a secret to a

tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well

broadcast it on the evening news.

DANNY

I met the guy at a party.  He said he

wanted to do a biggie. He's new in

town so I offered my services.

TANNER

This chink have a name?

DANNY

Bubba.

DANNY (cont'd)

I swear. That's all he gave me.

Hell, I didn't give him my real name either

(off their skeptical looks)

He figured the less we know about

each other, the better.

TANNER

You better not be blowing smoke up

My ass, Flynne.

DANNY

After that ass-whipping you gave me?

GARCETTI

(finishing up with the bundle)

What's on the other end of this thing?

DANNY

Now that I can help you with. Nasty

boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear.

He's a chef.

Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure

they're keeping box scores on the guy.

GARCETTI

Sounds like you hooked up with some

fine citizens, Flynne.

DANNY

Oh they're all that and the

proverbial bag of chips.

TANNER

What're your taking down?

DANNY

Standard vig.  Minus five for a

certain blabber-mouth moron by the

name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living

proof that natural selection is a

flawed theory.

TANNER

Did you really think you were slick

enough to pull this off?

DANNY

Look man, I just wanted to make some

dough and disappear.  I didn't want

to wait around for Domingo to figure

out who doubled back on him.

DANNY (cont'd)

But now I've seen the error of my

ways.  I'll just walk away ... call

the whole deal off.

GARCETTI

Wrong.

DANNY

You mean you want me to roll on these guys?

DANNY (cont'd)

No. No way.  These guys catch a

whiff and I'm a fucking bag of Bandini.

TANNER

You've got no choice.

DANNY

Whata you mean I've got no choice?

TANNER

Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in

la casa grande ...

DANNY

For that old possession charge?

Gimme a break.

TANNER

No. You just handed us a new one.  We

can go Federal on your ass right now:

ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent

to buy and distribute $250,000 worth

of crank.  What's the mandatory on

that, Al?

GARCETTI

Dime, minimum.

TANNER (O.S.)

And believe me, word will get out that

you're a pro rat.

GARCETTI (O.S.)

That's not good in prison. It's just

not good.

GARCETTI

What's that smell?

DANNY

That would be me.

GARCETTI

What'd you do, piss your pants?

DANNY

Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect

zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?

GARCETTI

Who'd have thought it?  Danny

"Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go

large right under our noses.

DANNY

Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.

GARCETTI

No.  You've got me all wrong.  I

mean, in you own pussified way, you

actually got some nuts in your little sack.

TANNER

Bullshit. He's a liar.

DANNY

News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.

TANNER

You think you're so god damned smart,

don't you?

TANNER (cont'd)

Well, you played the wrong mark this

time, asshole.

CUT TO:

LIZ

Why didn't you just ask for

directions back there?

DANNY/TOM

Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?

LIZ

You mean like the Donner Party?

DANNY/TOM

Hey, do you think you could eat me if

you had to?  And if so, which part do

you think you would find the most

delicious?

LIZ

Tom, quit fucking around.

DANNY/TOM

Okay, okay.

(peering through the windshield)

There's a house up there. I'll go ask

for directions.

LIZ

You think that's a good idea?

DANNY/TOM

What do you mean?

LIZ

Look at that place. It's creepy.

DANNY/TOM

First you want me to ask for

directions, then you don't.  Which is it?

LIZ

I wanted you to ask back there.  You

know, before you got us lost.

DANNY/TOM

Just no pleasing you, is there?

LIZ

Just admit you're wrong.

DANNY/TOM

We all know how much you like hearing

that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong.

There.  You happy?

LIZ

Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom.

It gets old.

DANNY/TOM

No. You know what gets old? Being

reminded what a loser you are every

time you screw up.

LIZ

Here it comes, poor Tom.

DANNY/TOM

But that's okay, Liz, you're the one

with the steady job, you pay all the

bills. I'm just an unemployed

musician.  You have every right.

LIZ

That is so unfair.

DANNY/TOM

My sentiments exactly.

LIZ

Why are you doing this?

LIZ (cont'd)

I never once asked you to stop

playing. I wouldn't dream of it. So

don't take your low self-esteem out

on me.

LIZ

... Tom ... screw it.  Tell me when you're

ready to apologize.

DANNY

(on the bed, whispering)

I'm sorry, Liz. I love you and I'm sorry.

COLETTE (O.S.)

This seat taken?

DANNY

Oh. Hi.

COLETTE

What happened to your eye?

DANNY

Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.

(beat)

By the way, I'm not looking for a

matching set.

(off her puzzled look)

Where's Quincey?

COLETTE

Don't worry. He's out of town.

DANNY

How far out of town?

COLETTE

Trust me. We're safe.

COLETTE (cont'd)

Please keep playing.

COLETTE (cont'd)

That's nice. What is it?

DANNY

Miles Davis. "All Blues."

COLETTE

Never heard of him.

DANNY

Just a fucked-up guy who played

beautiful music.

COLETTE

Like you?

DANNY

Nah. I'm strictly minor league...

except for the fucked-up part.

DANNY

Dude played his soul right out the

end of the horn. No false notes.

Always honest.

COLETTE

And you admire that?

DANNY

It's the only way to play.

COLETTE

Is that how you play?

DANNY

I try.

COLETTE

No false notes?

COLETTE

No deep dark secrets?

DANNY

(cold and abrupt):

What are you up to?

COLETTE

Nothing.

DANNY

What do you want from me, Colette?

COLETTE

I don't want anything. Why are you

so suspicious?

DANNY

It gets me through the day.

COLETTE

You really need to lighten up.

COLETTE (cont'd)

Just relax.

DANNY

Look, I can't help you with Quincey

if that's what you're after.

COLETTE

This has nothing to do with him.

DANNY

So you're just attracted to me, is that it?

COLETTE

Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?

DANNY

How much time do you have?

COLETTE

What is wrong with you?

DANNY

How much time do you have?

COLETTE

You've got a comeback for everything,

don't you, Danny? You use 'em like

some sort of shield.

DANNY

Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?

COLETTE

There you go again. You're nothing

but false notes.

DANNY

You don't like the tune, find another

station.

COLETTE

What are you hiding, Danny?

DANNY

Therapy session is over.

COLETTE

You think you're the only one down

here with a sad story?

DANNY

No. But I'm the only one with my sad

story.

(beat)

And that's how it's gonna stay.

Garcetti

Harlan Dale Monty a.k.a. Pooh-Bear.

Did five years manslaughter for

beating a pimp to death with an

electric wheelchair.

DANNY

Excuse me?

GARCETTI

Several possession charges, but nothing major.

DANNY

Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?

GARCETTI

They have. But they never found a lab.

TANNER

That's because he doesn't have one.

DANNY

Whata you mean?  He told me -

TANNER

Guy scores dope and dollar from

ripping off other drug dealers.  As

least that's what the word is.

DANNY

What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?

TANNER

That's probably what he would have

done if we hadn't found out about

your get-rich-quick scheme.

GARCETTI

You're lucky, Flynne.

DANNY

Funny, I don't feel lucky.

GARCETTI

We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D..

We'll have your sorry ass covered.

DANNY

What if he caps me before you can

make a move?

TANNER

Golly, I hadn't thought of that.

GARCETTI

Don't we always take good care of you?

DANNY

Speaking of which ... you run that license

plate for me?

GARCETTI

You mean the menacing red car?

DANNY

What? Is it bad?

TANNER

I'm afraid so, Danny.

DANNY

Who is it?

GARCETTI

Brace yourself.

DANNY

Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?

GARCETTI

Worse. Much worse.

(beat)

A teacher.

TANNER

Car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer.

GARCETTI

She's 57 and she's been teaching

third grade for the last 33 years.

TANNER

Now that's scary!

GARCETTI

You're paranoid, Flynne.  I think

that crank is finally starting to get

the best of you.

GARCETTI (V.O.)

When is the deal going down?

DANNY (V.O.)

I'm making the small buy tonight ...

if I don't get beaten to death with a

wheelchair or something.  If

everyone is happy, we'll do the big

deal later in the week.

JIMMY

You sure you don't want me to go with you?

DANNY

Pooh-Bear, my man.  What's up?

LITTLE BILL

He's blue.

BIG BILL

Comin' down from a 10 day ride.

DANNY

You want to do this some other time?

POOH-BEAR

(gloomy and tired)

Pull your pants down.

DANNY

I'm sorry?

POOH-BEAR

Pull your motherfucking pants down.

DANNY

(laughing nervously)

Come on, guys ...

POOH-BEAR

Big Bill.

BIG BILL

Argh, matie. I'm a pirate.

POOH-BEAR

Little Bill

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

Introduce him to Captain Steubing.

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

You'll have to excuse him, he ain't

ate for over a week.

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

That and the rabies.  Don't make for

a happy weasel.

DANNY

(trying to stay calm)

Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is

this?

(off Pooh-Bear's silence)

It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.

POOH-BEAR

Big Bill

Big Bill pushes Danny up to the cage, which comes up to about waist

level.

POOH-BEAR

Captain Steubing thinks you might

work for the police.

DANNY

What?!

POOH-BEAR

Don't address me.  I didn't make the

accusation.

DANNY

Please .. I don't know what you're ...

POOH-BEAR

Uh-uh-uh ...

DANNY

Jesus Christ.

(to the weasel)

Um ... I'm not .. Captain Steubing.

I'm not working for the cops.

POOH-BEAR

He don't believe you. Big Bill.

BIG BILL

Drop your package in the cage.

DANNY

My what?

BIG BILL

Put your pee-pee through the hole.

DANNY

This is fucking crazy!

BIG BILL

Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.

DANNY

Oh fuck ... oh Jesus ...

POOH-BEAR

Shoot him.

DANNY

Okay! Okay!

DANNY (cont'd)

(eyeing the wild rodent)

Oh my God ... oh-my-fucking-God ...

POOH-BEAR

Now get talkin'

DANNY

I didn't fucking do anything! I

swear to God!

POOH-BEAR

You got something to tell Captain

Steubing, you'd better do it now.

DANNY

(rapid-fire)

Captain Steubing, listen to me.

You're after the wrong guy. This is

the fuck you should be talking to.

DANNY (cont'd)

Jimmy told me that Little Bill's been

shorting Pooh-Bear ... settin' up his

own stuff on the side.

LITTLE BILL

That's a pack of discharge.

DANNY

It's true. Jimmy saw him flashing a

pimp role at a bar the other night ...

said he was dissin' your ass in front

of one of your customers.

POOH-BEAR

Man'll say a lot of thing when he's

sporting weasel food for a pecker.

LITTLE BILL

Damn straight.

POOH-BEAR

Least I can do is check it out though.

DANNY

Can I pull my dick out now?

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

Big Bill

Big Bill pats Little Bill down.

LITTLE BILL

(holding up his arms)

Go ahead. I got nothing to hide.

DANNY

Can I pull my dick out?

BIG BILL

He's clean.

LITTLE BILL

What?

DANNY

CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!

POOH-BEAR

(eyes on Little Bill)

Yeah.

DANNY

I ought to just call this whole thing

off right now.

POOH-BEAR

Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill

you.  Please, Danny.

DANNY

What the hell was that? Who told you

I was five-0?

POOH-BEAR

No one. It was just a test. I need

to be sure of who I'm dealing with

from time-to-time.

POOH-BEAR (cont'd)

Take it easy.  You passed.

DANNY

Did it ever occur to you that someone

might cop to something they didn't do

rather than have their balls chewed

off by a rabid weasel?

POOH-BEAR

I'll keep that in mind.

TANNER

We're in business.

GARCETTI

Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.

DANNY

That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.

TANNER

We got the 411 on your good old boy.

TANNER (cont'd)

Nothing local so we ran his prints

through the F.B.I. Believed to be a

major supplier in Texas.  Jumped bail

on a murder rap last April.

DANNY

Murder.  Beautiful.

TANNER

Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.

DANNY

You know, I'm starting to think I'd

rather take my chances with Domingo

than go through any more of this shit.

GARCETTI

Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.

TANNER

Took a pig-slicker to the heart.

DANNY

Jesus.

TANNER

I thought you'd be happy.

DANNY

Yeah.

NANCY

Who is it?

DANNY (O.S.)

It's Tom.

DANNY

All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?

NANCY

Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a

bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago.

Said you looked so bad, he barely

recognized you.

NANCY (cont'd)

Billy's a cop now, you know.

VERNE

Highway Patrol.

NANCY

He said you were ... the people you

Were with ... well ...

VERNE

Said you were a drug addict.

DANNY

Maybe I should just go.

NANCY

No. We want to help you, Tom.

NANCY (cont'd)

I know everyone deals with grief in

their own way.  I know how hard it is

to find closure.

DANNY

Closure? How do you find closure

when her killers are still running

around out there?

NANCY

I found forgiveness in my heart for

the people who killed my daughter. I

gave my grief to Jesus Christ.

DANNY

Is that what you want me to do?  Put

it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out

in the afterlife?

NANCY

You've got to deal with this sooner

or later, Tom. You can't keep

hiding.

DANNY

Maybe I am dealing with it.

NANCY

I know it's not my place to pass

judgement on you but ...

DANNY

Then why don't I see any pictures

Of me up there?

VERNE

That was my idea.

DANNY

You never did like me much, did you

Verne?

(beat)

And you can't stand it that I walked

out of there alive and Liz didn't.

You think I'm a coward,

don't you?

DANNY (cont'd)

I don't blame you for hating me.  At

least I understand that.

(back to Nancy)

But forgiving the butchers who killed

Liz well I'm having some trouble

with that one.

NANCY

Love your enemies, bless them that

curse you, do good to them that hate

you, and pray for them which

despitefully use you, a persecute

you.

DANNY

I'm genuinely happy that you found

some peace, Nancy. But you can't

forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And

you can't forgive for me.

NANCY

Your hatred makes them stronger and

you weaker.

DANNY

I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.

(beat)

Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night

she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a

chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?

NANCY

It's not too late to show her you're sorry.

DANNY

How?

VERNE

By not disgracing her memory!

DANNY

What does that mean?

VERNE

You might as well be spitting on her

grave every time you put drugs up

your nose.  Or did you just

conveniently forget that it was drug

dealers who killed my daughter?

VERNE (cont'd)

You ever think you might be buying

drugs from the very people who took

her life?

DANNY

You don't understand.

VERNE

Understand what?

DANNY

Nothing. It's ... it's complicated. I

just want you to know ... I'm not what

you think I am.

DANNY

Who is it?

COLETTE (O.S.)

It's me.

DANNY

I'm kind of busy.

COLETTE (O.S.)

Please open the door, Danny.

DANNY

Oh Jesus.

DANNY (cont'd)

Colette ... You've gotta leave.

COLETTE

We been through that.

DANNY

What about a battered woman's

shelter? You can move you kid in

with you.

COLETTE

I need my paycheck.

DANNY

You can still work.

COLETTE

He knows where I work.

DANNY

Find a new job.

COLETTE

It's not that easy. I just got a

raise. I need the money.

DANNY

You always been this stubborn?

COLETTE

From day one.

(beat)

I was a breach birth. They tried for

hours to turn my little butt around.

But I wouldn't let 'em.

DANNY

Ass first into the world.

COLETTE

I been that way ever since.

COLETTE (cont'd)

Look at us.  What a pair.

COLETTE/DANNY

Ouch.

They laugh.

COLETTE

Can we try that again?

DANNY

I can't.

DANNY (cont'd)

I can't.

COLETTE

Why not?

DANNY

I just can't. Okay?

COLETTE

What's wrong, Danny?

DANNY

Look, maybe you oughta' leave.

COLETTE

No. I want to know what the hell

is going on.

DANNY

I can't tell you.

COLETTE

There's someone else, isn't there?

DANNY

Yes.

DANNY (cont'd)

Don't go.

(beat)

Please, Colette.

(she stops)

Stay and talk to me, please.

DANNY (O.S.)

I'm so tired of lying.

CUT TO:

BO

What you want to do is go back the

way you came and make a left at the

bottom. It'll take you right to the

highway.

DANNY/TOM

That's it?

BO

Are you Australian?

DANNY/TOM

No.

BO

Good. I fucking hate Australians.

DANNY/TOM

You got a bathroom I can use before

we hit the road?

BO

Yeah? First door on the right.

It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda'

filthy is all.

DANNY/TOM

(to Liz)

You mind?

BO

No, I don't mind.  That's how come I

told you about it.

DANNY/TOM

I was talking to my wife.

LIZ

Try to make it fast.

LIZ (cont'd)

(trying to make small talk)

So.  What do you do for a living around here?

BO

You know. This and that.

BO

Skeeters. They're bad up here.

DANNY

She died knowing that I was a coward...

that I didn't lift a finger to help her.

COLLETTE

There was nothing you could have done.

DANNY

No, you're wrong, I tried to tell

myself the same thing but I could

have gotten up. I could have done

something.

COLETTE

They would have killed you too.

DANNY

(finally looks her in the eye)

Nothing could be worse then this

slow death I'm living now.

DANNY

(looking up)

Colette...I want to help

you, with Quincey.

COLETTE

No Danny, Don't-

DANNY (cont'd)

But you gotta be serious about it.

COLETTE

Really, I don't want to.

DANNY

I want to do this for you.  I

want to do something good

for a change.

DANNY (cont'd)

I want you to hide this

somewhere where Quincy

won't find it.

COLETTE

What is it?

DANNY

Never mind. Just do what I say.

He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.

COLETTE

I don't want to.

DANNY

I'm offering you the chance to take

care of your problems. Take it.

(she still hesitates)

Don't make the same mistake I did,

Colette. Do something while you

have a chance. Do it for your daughter

before something happens.

(beat)

Believe me, you don't want to

live with this burden.

(firm)

He helds the baggie out again. Colette

reluctantly takes it from him.

DANNY (cont'd)

Tommorrow night, when he is asleep.

I want you to beep me at this number.

He writes the number down on a dollar bill.

DANNY

Will you do that?

(off her nod)

Then I want you to get out of the room.

COLETTE

Why?

DANNY

Don't worry about it. Just go across

the street and watch. You'll know

when it's safe to go back.

DANNY

Just do it. All your problems with

Quincey will be taken care of.

JIMMY

What's this?

DANNY

Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.

(beat)

It's for you.

JIMMY

But why? You only owe me five. And

that's not till after we close the deal tonight.

DANNY

You aren't coming with me.

DANNY (cont'd)

I need you to do me a favor instead.

JIMMY

Okay

DANNY

Wait till I tell you what it is.

JIMMY

It don't matter. I'll do it. And you

sure as hell don't have to pay me.

DANNY

Why?

JIMMY

You're my best friend, man. I'd do

anything for you.

DANNY

Jimmy, look, there's something I have

to tell you.

JIMMY

Hey, check it out...

DANNY

What the hell is that?

JIMMY

(Proudly)

It's you! I didn't have a picture or

nothin' so I had to describe you to

the guy. Not bad though, huh?

DANNY (cont'd)

I really have to tell you something.

It's important.

JIMMY

What?

DANNY

I'm not a tweaker.

(beat)

I don't use drugs. I never had.

DANNY (cont'd)

I'm not joking.

JIMMY

But...I've seen you.

DANNY

When? When did you ever see me use?

JIMMY

This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth

question, is it?

DANNY

You ever notice how I always showed

up, in the middle of a binge? Left

before it was over? How I sneak away

for cap-naps? How when the crank

came around to me, I always said I'd

just done one?

DANNY (cont'd)

You asked me how I always keep my

shit together. Well, that's how.

JIMMY

No one ever noticed?

DANNY

Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped

-out tweakers? It was easy.

JIMMY

But... why? Why would you pretend?

DANNY

I can't tell you.

JIMMY

You don't trust me?

DANNY

I don't trust anybody.

JIMMY

And you want me to do you some big favor?

DANNY (cont'd)

It's cool. I understand

Danny gets up to leave.

JIMMY

Wait

(beat)

If you don't trust me, why did you

tell me that stuff about not using drugs?

DANNY

Because I don't want to see you end

up like Kujo and those other losers.

(beat)

I thought that maybe if you knew that

I didn't use, you might see it in

yourself to go clear.

DANNY

You mad at me, Jimmy?

JIMMY

I don't know... a little. I wish you

would have let me in on it from the

beginning.

DANNY

I'm sorry. I couldn't.

DANNY

You know you can get that tattoo removed,

don't you.

JIMMY

Nah... I want to keep it.

(beat)

Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration

...you know...like when

I detox?

DANNY

Good for you Jimmy.

DANNY

I really want you to take this.

JIMMY

Wouldn't be a favor if you were

paying me. I'll just take my five

when the deal is done.

DANNY

You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.

BUBBA

Yeah.

DANNY

Everything go?

BUBBA

Yeah.

DANNY

Just make sure you come alone. This

guy won't like any surprises

BUBBA

I ain't a idiot, asshole.

DANNY

I'll see you tonight.

TANNER

Man of few words.

GARCETTI

Nervous?

DANNY

With you clowns watching my back? What

do you think?

GARCETTI

Just make sure you hit the floor when

we come in. It could get ugly in there.

TANNER

Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.

VOICES (O.S.)

How'd it go?

DANNY

You tell me.

BUBBA

You ready to go meet the team?

TRAHN

For those of you who don't know this

is Tom Van Allen... a.k.a.  Danny

Flynne.

TRAHN (cont'd)

About a year and half ago, Mr. Van

Allen's wife was murdered at a meth

lab out near the Salton Sea. No one

was ever apprehended for the crime

but local authorities have always

assumed it was a hit and grab

perpetrated by rival drug dealers.

That is, until Tom here took it upon

himself to conduct a one-man

undercover operation at great risk to

his own personal safety.

AGENT ONE

He's a civilian?

(off Trahn's nod)

How the hell did you pull this off?

DANNY

I played the long shot. Just got lucky.

BOOKMAN

How about the car? The model?

BOOKMAN (cont'd)

Was it a truck?  S.U.V.? Sedan?

DANNY

All I saw was the headlights. The high

beams were on.

BOOKMAN

Not even a guess?

DANNY

(pissed off0

How many times do we have to go through

this?

BOOKMAN (cont'd)

You said one of the perpetrators crossed

in front of the headlights ...

DANNY

Yeah, but he was in silhouette.

BOOKMAN

How about in the house?

DANNY

They were wearing ski masks. I told

you all of this.

BOOKMAN

Did you see his hair color?

DANNY

No, Why?

BOOKMAN

Forensics found this on your wife.

BOOKMAN

What is it?

DANNY

Nothing, I'm trying to remember...

DANNY (cont'd)

I'm sorry... I didn't see his hair

color... I'm sure of it.

AGENT ONE

Why didn't you tell him?

DANNY

Because I wanted to find them myself

(beat)

I wanted to kill them.

DANNY (V.O.)

I swear to God I would have done 'em

right then and there...but I had to

be positive.  And even if Tanner was

involved, I had to be sure about

Garcetti

EXT. D.M.V-DAY

DANNY (V.O.)

So I became Danny Flynne.

DANNY (V.O.)

I dropped myself right in their laps.

DANNY (V.O.)

I gave up whoever they asked for,

whenever they wanted. I was a

fucking dream rat. But the whole

time I was sizing them up, looking

for any evidence that they were the

guys who killed my wife.

DANNY (V.O.)

But they did everything by the book.

DANNY

I knew that if these were the guys I

was looking for, I'd have to set up a

deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able

to walk away from it.

TRAHN

That's when he called me. He told me

his story and he pitched me a plan.

DANNY

These guys are smart. I knew they

wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew

all the players. I needed a big buyer.

TRAHN (V.O.)

We had one of our C.I.'s call Tanner

and Garcetti with an "anonymous" tip

about the deal.

TANNER

(the line takes on a whole new meaning)

This could be the one we're looking for.

AGENT TWO

How sure are you that you're not

chasing two good cops? I mean all

you've really got  is one red hair.

That's still your only evidence.

TRAHN

Not anymore. We tapped these guys' phones

and computers at Gardena P.D.

Tanner and Garcetti didn't

report on this deal. Not a peep.

They haven't coordinated with

Palmdale P.D. They're keeping it off

the books. It looks like we've got

the right guys.

(beat)

We'll find out for sure tonight.

TRAHN

How you holding up?

DANNY

I'm fine. Little nervous...little

disappointed that I didn't finish

this myself.

TRAHN

Hey, you did the right thing. You

wouldn't have stood a chance against

these boys by yourself. They have

eaten your ass alive.

DANNY

Oh shit

TRAHN

What?

DANNY

Can you do me a favor? This girl I

know, her boyfriend's a real piece of

shit-dude's really jamming her up.

I promised her I'd try to help.

DANNY (cont'd)

Could you call Gardena P.D. tell 'em

you got a tip that the guy's holding?

Maybe have 'em send out a patrol car?

TRAHN

I'll see what I can do.

DANNY

Hey guys...

DANNY (O.S.)

(filtered)

I need to stop for some cigarettes.

AGENT ONE

(into min-mike)

All right people, heads up.  Blue team?

MAID ONE

I've got a visual.

AGENT ONE

(filtered)

Red team?

WORKMAN ONE

He's heading to his room.

AGENT ONE

(filtered)

Black team?

AGENT ONE

Okay.  It's all yours.

GARCETTI

Half an hour to kickoff.

DANNY (O.S.)

It's open.

TRAHN

You alone?

TRAHN (cont'd)

Any word from Pooh-Bear?

TRAHN (cont'd)

You okay, hoss?

TRAHN (cont'd)

What the hell?

JIMMY

Danny told me to tell you that he was sorry.

(beat)

He said he had to take care of this himself.

TANNER

Here he comes.

DANNY

Easy, boy.

TANNER

Where's Bubba?

GARCETTI

Maybe he isn't showing.

TANNER

Looks like Flynne's handling the

cash. Let's get into position.

DANNY

What the hell is this?

POOH-BEAR

Just some buddies.

DANNY

This is bullshit.  You didn't say

anything about anybody else being here.

POOH-BEAR

What the fuck are you gonna do about

it, dickhead?

DANNY

Come on, man, let's deal.

POOH-BEAR

Cool it. We got business.

DANNY

Yeah, dickhead.

POOH-BEAR

Oh my, oh my.

(beat)

Big Bill, come take a look at this.

POOH-BEAR

Oh lordy, oh lordy, oh lordy.  Pooh-

Bear done shot himself.

DANNY

Anybody there?

DANNY (cont'd)

Liz?

DANNY

I'm here, Liz. I'm here.

GARCETTI

Get the bag.

GARCETTI (cont'd)

Let's get out of here.

TANNER

Danny?

DANNY

My name is Tom.

DANNY (cont'd)

Tom Van Allen

TANNER

Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can

we talk about this?

DANNY

Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...

(beat)

You're in the bathroom.  You've been

shot in the shoulder ...

DANNY (cont'd)

... there's two guys with masks and

guns in the other room about to kill

your wife.

DANNY (cont'd)

But you know if you go out there,

they'll kill you, too.  You'll both

die.  What do you do?

DANNY (cont'd)

Do you go out there and die like a

man or do you live to fight another day?

Danny (cont'd)

What do you do?

DANNY (cont'd)

Answer the question!

Danny (cont'd)

What do you do!

TANNER

Please ... don't do this ...

DANNY

Answer the fucking question!

TANNER

Does that answer your question?

(beat)

I fight.

I fight and I die like a man.

(beat)

You're a fucking coward, Flynne.  You

lived like one and now you're gonna

die like one.

DANNY

(mumbling)

Glock semi-automatic 9 mm ...

KID

Tenifer matte finish, Polymer grip,

fixed sights, 4 and 1/2 inch barrel,

22 ounces, double action and a ...

KID

... and a TEN ROUND magazine ...

KID (cont'd)

Or did I say ELEVEN?

KID (cont'd)

Which was it, mister?  Was it ten or was it eleven?

(beat)

Pretty big fucking difference if you ask me.

DANNY

It doesn't matter.

TANNER

Too late to be a hero.

DANNY

Ten it is.

DANNY

(softly)

You're dead.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

DANNY

My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a

trumpet player.

VOICE (O.S.)

Nah, you're Danny Flynne.

QUINCEY

You're a motherfucking rat.

COLETTE

You said you wouldn't kill him!

COLETTE

You lied to me!

QUINCEY

Oops.  My bad.

DANNY

Colette, what happened?  Didn't the cops ...

QUINCEY

The cops came.  But they didn't find

nothing.  Turns out their C.I. game

'em some bad information.

QUINCEY (cont'd)

You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this

is what you get, homes.

QUINCEY (cont'd)

Domingo thought you might be the one

who went rat on him.

QUINCEY (cont'd)

So I brought in a rat of my own.

DANNY

You set me up?

QUINCEY

Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo.

DANNY

You're good, princess. I'll give you that.

COLETTE

Danny, it's not what you think.

COLETTE

I owed them money ... a lot of

money ... they didn't give me a

choice.  You know how it works.  When

I got to know you, I tried to back

out ... that's when they did this ...

(she indicates the bruises)

But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I

didn't want to see you get hurt.

DANNY

She selling me a bill, home boy?

QUINCEY

Nah, she ain't lying.  She took a

pretty good beating from you, ace. I

seen grown men crack after a lot

less.  But not this bitch.

(beat)

It was very touching.

DANNY

Then why are we here?

COLETTE

They threatened to kill my daughter.

(beat)

I had no choice.

(beat)

I'm sorry, Danny.

DANNY

It's okay. It's okay.

(Danny touches her face.)

(beat)

God damn, you're beautiful.

QUINCEY

Jesus.

QUINCEY (cont'd)

Let's go.

COLETTE

No!

QUINCEY

You wanna die here with him or come with me?

DANNY

Colette, go.

COLETTE

I don't want to leave you.

DANNY

Your daughter needs you.  Go.

DISSOLVE TO:

DANNY (V.O.)

So what is it?  Who am I after it's

all said and done?

DANNY (cont'd)

Tom Van Allen or Danny Flynne?

(beat)

Avenging angel or plain old Judas?

DANNY (cont'd)

(weakly)

You decide, friend.  You decide.

DANNY (cont'd)

I'm too tired ... so you decide.

CUT TO:

DANNY (V.O.)

Oh shit. What is this?

DANNY (cont'd)

Am I dead?

DANNY (cont'd)

Linoleum.  This must be hell.

TATTO

(warped, distorted)

Hang in there buddy.

DANNY (cont'd)

Oh no.  What a fucking cliche.

FADE TO WHITE:

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

DANNY (V.O.)

Well, I've had some time to think

about it and it's pretty simple after

all.  I guess it's like the man said -

"Man is the measure of all things."

I should know.  I ran the gamut.

Avenging Angel, Judas, loving

husband, prodigal son, prince of

Denmark.  I was all of those things.

(beat)

Tom Van Allen got his revenge.

Good for Tom.  And Danny Flynne? He

got gut-shot for being the low-life

rat that he was.  Sucks for him.

(beat)

But as far as I'm concerned, they're both dead.

DANNY (cont'd)

But what about this guy? Who is he?

DANNY (cont'd)

To tell you the truth, I don't know yet.

DANNY (cont'd)

But I like his chances.

DANNY (cont'd)

I really like his chances.

FADE OUT.
