TAXI!!

JIMMY

We're going the wrong way.

DAD

Put that away. We'll look like

We'll never get a cab here. Let's

JIMMY

Seventh is

I know where we are!

Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?

Mister. How about it. One dollar?

NICK

(emptying the wallet)

All right. The Gold Card.

(tossing the credit card

in EDDIE's face)

Don't leave home without it.

EDDIE

Let's beat it, man. I don't like

being up here.

NICK

What, scared of heights?

EDDIE

I dunno, man. After what happened to

Johnny Gobs --

NICK

Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and

walked off a roof, all right? No big

loss.

EDDIE

That ain't what I heard. That ain't

what I heard at all.

(beat)

I heard the bat got him.

NICK

Gimme a break, will you? Shut up...

EDDIE

Five stories, straight down. There

was

no blood

in the body.

NICK

No shit. It was all over the

pavement.

EDDIE

There was no blood, man.

(beat)

My brother says... all the bad things

you done... they come back and

haunt

you...

NICK

Listen to this. How old are you?

There

ain't no bat

EDDIE

My brother's a priest, man.

NICK

No wonder you're such a chickenshit.

Now

shut up

(conclusively)

There ain't no bat.

EDDIE

You shouldn'ta turned the gun on

that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --

NICK

Do you want this money or

I'm gettin' outta here.

Don't kill me... don't kill me...

BATMAN

I won't kill you. I want you to do

me a favor.

Tell your friends. Tell all your

friends.

... it is no longer enough to go

after the small-time punks and petty

criminals who infest the streets of

Gotham City. Crime and corruption

must be attacked at the root!

If elected, my first act as district

attorney will be to return an

indictment against

Boss Carl

Grissom

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

DENT

(on the TV screen)

Together we can make Gotham city a

safe place for decent people to live

and work and play.

JACK NAPIER

Decent people shouldn't live here.

They'd be much happier someplace

else.

ALICIA

Anything new?

JACK

The usual gas. If this clown could

lay a hand on Grissom... I would've

had to kill him by now.

ALICIA

If Grissom knew about

us

... he

might kill

you

.

JACK

Don't think so, angel. I'm too

valuable. That's the way I've

planned it.

(pause)

And besides, he doesn't know.

ALICIA

You look just fine, Jack.

JACK

... I didn't ask.

. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed

PATROLMAN

They found him hugging a drainpipe.

He was scared to come off the roof.

KNOX

Great, but tell me: is this another

you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's

the third one this week.

PATROLMAN

(testily)

I dunno. What's "what"?

KNOX

Good answer. I'm gonna put you in

for a commendation.

ECKHARDT

Oh Christ, it's Knox.

KNOX

Hiya, gents. This anything I should

know about?

ECKHARDT

Nothing out of the routine.

NICK

A

bat

, I tell you, a giant

bat

!

He wanted me to do him a

favor

...!

KNOX

No offense, boys, but these guys are

seeing

something

up there.

ECKHARDT

No comment. Print what you like.

KNOX

Come on. One question. Is there a

six-foot bat in Gotham City?

KNOX (cont.)

If so, is he on the police payroll?

If so, what's he pulling down after

taxes?

EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

JACK

You didn't show up.

ECKHARDT

We had another bat sighting.

JACK

I'm sure that was vitally important.

Listen: things are heating up.

Someone is leaking information to

Harvey Dent.

ECKHARDT

I'm doing the best I can. If it's a

problem --

JACK

Eckhardt... our problems are your

problems.

ECKHARDT

I'll work on it.

JACK

Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little

ostentatious on a cop's salary,

don't you think?

ECKHARDT

(knocking his hands away)

I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to

you.

JACK

You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You

should be thinking about the future.

ECKHARDT

Ambition.

(nodding his head)

Forget it, Jack. You'll never run

that organization.

JACK

And why's that?

ECKHARDT

You're a psycho, friend. You're an

A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows

it.

JACK

Here. Use mine.

JACK (cont.)

It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt

here is a good cop. A real good cop.

(pause; smiling)

Inexpensive.

KNOX

What have you got for me, Jerry?

KNOX (cont.)

Nice, but... maybe a little more gore

on the fangs, huh?

COLLEAGUE

Hey Knox, you got a visitor.

KNOX

I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and

dust him, okay?

COLLEAGUE

This one you might want to dust

yourself.

KNOX

... Vicki Vale.

VICKI

How'd you know it was me?

KNOX

Honey -- I would know any randomly

selected

square inch

of Vicki

Vale.

(grinning)

If I had a good enough hint.

KNOX (cont.)

Where the hell have you been?

VICKI

A nice, restful vacation.

KNOX

God, a girl could get hurt doing

this.

VICKI

I do get hurt.

KNOX

Got any more of those?

VICKI

Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal

here. What's new and hot in Gotham

City?

KNOX

It's too good, Vick. We got a six-

foot bat that swoops out of the

night and preys on evildoers.

VICKI

(laughing)

Evildoers, huh? Big or small?

KNOX

Small so far. I mean -- they don't

allow bats in boardrooms, do they.

VICKI

Speaking of which... I hear the

notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a

big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.

KNOX

Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every

law'n'order freak in the city's

gonna be there.

KNOX (cont.)

Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying --

KNOX (cont.)

Aw, Vicki. Vicki!

(apprehensively)

Got a date?

KNOX (cont.)

Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always

loved you. Will you marry me?

VICKI

(straightening her clothes)

No.

KNOX

Well, I'm starving. Will you at

least buy me a hamburger?

VICKI

Yes, but please -- be gentle.

GRISSOM

Nine points ahead in the new poll. I

don't like the way this is shaping

up.

JACK

We can always pop him. -- Or pop

someone close to him.

LIEUTENANT

Let's feed him to the bat.

GRISSOM

He's going after our front

companies. Specifically Ace

Chemical. Which would tie us

in with Councilman Kane, Senator

Miller... on up the line.

(pause)

We have to clean out our files

before the subpoena comes down.

LIEUTENANT

How do we go? The usual fire?

GRISSOM

I'm thinking break-in. Trash the

office, remove the relevant

documents...

JACK

"Industrial espionage."

GRISSOM

That's right. And Jack --

(pause)

I'd like you to handle this

operation personally.

JACK

...

Me

?

GRISSOM

Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd

mind waiting in the other room.

JACK

Why do you need

me

to handle a

simple break-in?

GRISSOM

(emphatically)

Because I want someone I can

trust

.

GRISSOM (cont.)

We'll work out the details later.

But it's got to be soon. -- All

right, that's all for now.

GRISSOM (cont.)

You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an

important job. I can't trust it to

somebody who'll screw up.

JACK

I understand.

GRISSOM

(smiling)

Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck.

GRISSOM (cont.)

My friend, your luck is just about

to change.

GRISSOM (cont.)

Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

ALFRED

Which bathroom is that, air?

KNOX

The small one.

KNOX (cont.)

Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You

actually

know

all these people?

VICKI

Some. I

am

a rich bitch, remember.

(pause)

I'm quoting.

KNOX

Yeah, I guess we move in different

circles. -- Though I

did

meet a

one-eyed pimp last week.

Commissioner Gordon! What do you

hear from our pointy-eared friend?

GORDON

Knox, for the ninth time, and you

can quote me --

there is no bat

KNOX

Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be

one

honest cop in Gotham city.

DENT

How's your luck, Jim?

KNOX

Mr. Dent. What's

Mr. Knox, I think we have enough

real problems in this city without

worrying about ghosts and goblins

Just what I've heard. Rich.

Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.

KNOX

Likes to kill?

VICKI

(smiling)

Women find him magnetic.

KNOX

I bet they like him for his big

charity balls.

VICKI

That, and the sweet smell of two

hundred million bucks.

KNOX

Well, you know me. The more they've

got, the less they're worth.

KNOX

Great. Give me a grant.

BRUCE

I might consider it if you introduce

me to Miss Vale.

KNOX

"This is Miss Vale." --

That

felt

redundant.

BRUCE

(to VICKI)

You're just back from Corto Maltese.

I saw your combat photos. Quite a

departure for you.

VICKI

That's intriguing. They haven't been

you be staying in Gotham for a

while?

VICKI

As far as I know.

BRUCE

Good. Then with any luck we'll run

into each other.

ALFRED

Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon

was compelled to leave --

very

unexpectedly. He asked me to convey

his regrets.

BRUCE

Thank you, Alfred.

(to VICKI)

I hope you'll excuse me. It was a

great pleasure meeting you.

(to KNOX)

And you.

KNOX

I know the rich are different, but

that guy is

real

different.

KNOX (cont.)

Hello? Vicki?

VICKI

Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.

KNOX

What were you thinking?

VICKI

Yum, yum.

You mean Mister One-Nighter?

Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter."

I'm curious. I do this for a living.

I told him yes.

You're awfully sweet to be

not

Tell me, Vicki. There's something

I'm very curious about. What took

you down to Corto Maltese?

VICKI

... I guess I needed a change.

BRUCE

You were one of the most successful

magazine photographers in the city.

Everyone wanted you.

VICKI

Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?

BRUCE

Not since the shooting started.

VICKI

We went there once when I was

little. I played on the beach. And

at nights -- they had a band -- I

danced with my father on the hotel

patio.

(shrugging)

That was Corto Maltese. When the war

broke out I had to go back. And I

promised myself that this time... I

wouldn't look away.

BRUCE

What did you see?

VICKI

... Terror.

BRUCE

There's terror everywhere. Some

types are just more --

familiar

than others.

Do you assume that if I know you

better I won't like you as much?

you like this with the other women

seem to get a handle on this
