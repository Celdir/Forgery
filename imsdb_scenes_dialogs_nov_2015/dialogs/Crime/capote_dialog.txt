CUT TO:

TRUMAN

So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot

of his book, and he says to me: the

writing's going well, but I just

want to make sure it's not one of

those problem novels. I said: Jimmy,

your novel's about a Negro homosexual

who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't

you call that a problem?

CHRISTOPHER

Susan's father had a minor heart

attack, so she's writing more erotic

poems about death and sex.

BARBARA

It's so tiresome.

WILLIAMS

Hmm. What rhymes with angina?

GRAYSON

How's your writing?

TRUMAN

Oh, I've got a million ideas of what

to write next -- I just have to choose

one.

GRAYSON

Really?

TRUMAN

No.

BARBARA

Who would I want to play me? Natalie

Wood.

ROSE

Too fat.

BARBARA

Audrey Hepburn?

ROSE

Not bad. Sort of middle-class.

TRUMAN

When a movie is made of my life I

know exactly who I want as me...

(beat)

Marilyn Monroe.

FEMALE VOICE OVER THE PHONE

New Yorker magazine.

TRUMAN (ON PHONE)

William Shawn, please.

(he listens)

Adorable one? All of a sudden I know

what article I'm going to write for

you next.

TRUMAN

...never had anything like this happen

to them before. They're used to

sleeping at night with the doors

unlatched....

(laughs)

Yes, we should buy stock in Master

Locks -- all of Kansas will be in

the hardware store tomorrow.

TRUMAN

They have no idea who the killer is.

But it doesn't matter who the killer

is -- what matters is who the

townspeople imagine the killer is.

That's what I want to write about.

TRUMAN

I'm gonna need some help... I'm

thinking about Nelle -- she can

protect me...

TRUMAN

I want to leave tonight...

SMASH CUT TO:

NELLE

I figured you'd missed it.

TRUMAN

God I'm glad you agreed to come.

You're the only one I know with the

qualifications to be both a research

assistant and personal bodyguard.

(then, noticing)

Oh, Nelle, you poor thing.

NELLE

Off. Truman. Off.

(holds his hands)

I'm happy to see you too, but I can

still whip your behind.

PORTER #1

(reading tags)

Mr. Truman Capote, Miss Nelle Harper

Lee. Where would you like these,

sir?

TRUMAN

That one up there and that one on

the floor.

NELLE

What all did you bring?

PORTER #2

Thank you greatly, sir. It's an honor

to have you with us. If you don't

mind my saying, your last book was

even better than the first --

TRUMAN

You're sweet.

PORTER #2

Just when you think they've gotten

as good as they can get.

TRUMAN

Thank you. You're very kind.

PORTER #1

(to Nelle)

Ma'am.

NELLE

You're pathetic.

NELLE

You're pathetic.

TRUMAN

What?

NELLE

You paid them to say that.

NELLE

You paid them to say that!

TRUMAN

(squealing)

How'd you know? How did you know?!

NELLE

"Just when you think they've gotten

as good as they can get."

TRUMAN

You think that was too much?

(laughter)

I thought that was a good line.

NELLE

Pathetic.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

Alvin Dewey, Kansas Bureau of

Investigation. KBI.

TRUMAN

Mr. Alvin Dewey, please.

GUARD

Third floor. In what used to be the

Sheriff's Office.

CHURCH

The wife said no more smoking in the

house. I told her, "Fine. Walter's

got a couch upstairs in his apartment.

I'll stay with him and Dorothy till

we're done here."

(to Walter)

I've got my bag and a carton of

cigarettes in the car.

DEWEY

Roy.

TRUMAN

Mr. Dewey. Truman Capote from the

New Yorker.

TRUMAN

Hello.

TRUMAN

Bergdorf's.

NYE

Sorry?

TRUMAN

The scarf.

NYE

Oh.

(then)

Nice.

TRUMAN

Thank you.

(turns to Dewey)

I wonder when we could arrange an

interview? Some time to talk.

DEWEY

About what?

TRUMAN

We're not looking for any inside

information -- I don't care one way

or another if you catch whoever did

this -- I'm writing an article not

about the Clutter killings, but how

they're affecting the town, how you

all are bearing up --

DEWEY

I care.

TRUMAN

Excuse me?

DEWEY

I care.

(puts on his hat,

pulls out another

cigarette)

I care a great deal if we catch

whoever did this.

TRUMAN

Yes --

DEWEY

As do a lot of folks around here.

TRUMAN

Of course.

NYE

(to Church)

New Yorker?

CHURCH

You have press credentials?

NYE

What's the New Yorker?

CHURCH

Magazine.

TRUMAN

Magazines don't give out --

CHURCH

You can come to the news conference

with the rest of them.

(tips his hat to Nelle)

Sears and Roebuck.

DEWEY

I'll talk facts but I won't speculate.

The main fact here we need to be

clear on is not one, but four people

were killed. A lot of folks say Herb

Clutter had to be the main target

because he was dealt with the most

brutally --

JOURNALIST #1

Had his throat cut.

DEWEY

(a moment)

Yes. We'd all like to know why. But

it could've been any one of the family

they were after. We just don't know --

JOURNALIST #2

You've identified the murder weapon?

DEWEY

Wounds indicate a shotgun, close-

range, but no casings were found.

JOURNALIST #1

Twelve-gauge, hunting --

DEWEY

Right.

JOURNALIST #1

They were all shot in the face?

DEWEY

No. Nancy in the back of the head.

JOURNALIST #2

Is there any evidence of, I'm sorry,

sexual molestation of the women?

DEWEY

No.

JOURNALIST #2

Anything else stolen?

DEWEY

Kenyon's radio seems to be the only...

JOURNALIST #3

The boy was sixteen?

DEWEY

Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen.

JOURNALIST #2

It's her friend that found them?

DEWEY

Laura Kinney.

JOURNALIST #2

Spell that?

DEWEY

I assume you're okay with the Laura

part. K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave

her be.

OLD MAN

There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans,

a whole bunch of Mexicans...

DEWEY

(standing, stubs out

cigarette)

George, it's good to see you again.

I do have an opinion whether this

was the work of one man or a whole

bunch, as you said, but it doesn't

matter a whole lot whether it was

Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos.

We're going to find whoever did this.

Four good people from our community

are dead. Let's remember that. Okay

with you?

(holds up a notice)

The West Kansas Farm Committee's

offering a thousand dollar reward

for information leading to an arrest.

Please print that.

(moving to the exit)

Thank you all for coming.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

Mr. Dewey's protective of the

Clutters. I wonder how well he knew

them...

TRUMAN

He was foxy with that old man.

(turns to Nelle)

Are you ever gonna let me drive?

NELLE

Truman, you're a menace. You can

barely see over the wheel.

NELLE

This make you miss Alabama?

TRUMAN

(rolling window down,

shakes his head)

Not even a little bit.

FADE OUT.

TRUMAN

Hello.

NELLE

Morning.

GIRL #1

Hi.

NELLE

Can any of you tell me where I'd

find Laura Kinney?

GIRL #1

Oh, um...

NELLE

(gently)

Is that her? With the tall boy?

GIRL #2

Yeah. With Danny Burke.

NELLE

Danny Burke?

(Girl #2 nods)

Thank you.

GIRL #2

Oh, quiet yourself, Janice.

NELLE

Truman. Truman --

NELLE

These folks live their lives in a

particular way. You need to consider

adapting yourself to that fact.

TRUMAN

What --

NELLE

-- I'm gonna find out where those

two kids live. Maybe you'll let me

do that alone?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JACK (OVER PHONE)

I think I scared a friend of yours

this morning. He came looking for

you while I was writing.

TRUMAN

You hate my friends.

JACK

I wouldn't say hate. So long as they

don't knock on my door.

TRUMAN

I saw the bodies today.

JACK

Which?

TRUMAN

The Clutters. I looked inside the

coffins.

JACK

That's horrifying.

TRUMAN

It comforts me -- something so

horrifying it's freeing. It's a

relief. Normal life falls away.

(beat)

But, then, I was never much for normal

life --

JACK

No, you weren't.

TRUMAN

People here won't talk to me. They

want someone like you, like Nelle.

Me they hate.

JACK

I can't think of a single quality I

share with Nelle.

TRUMAN

Well --

JACK

Maybe manliness.

TRUMAN

My point exactly.

JACK

It's why I left the Midwest in the

first place. I knew I could only

find someone like you in New York

City.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

NELLE

Let's go.

CUT TO:

NELLE

Danny?

(Danny stops)

Would you mind terribly if I walked

with you for a bit?

CUT TO:

LAURA

I thought you were from the FBI with

your long coat.

TRUMAN

Is that so?

LAURA

That's why I ran off.

TRUMAN

I've been getting a lot of that

lately.

LAURA

It's fine talking to you all.

Practically nobody around here wants

to talk since what happened.

NELLE

Folks have been through a rough patch.

Including you.

(Laura nods)

Nancy was your best friend.

LAURA

She was my best friend.

NELLE

How has Danny been?

LAURA

Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible

ever happened to him before. Nancy

just started wearing his ring again

after this huge fight -- Mr. Clutter

was trying to get her to end it 'cause

Danny's Catholic.

NELLE

What were the Clutters?

LAURA

Methodist. Danny was the last person

at the house that night. That's why

Mr. Dewey's keeps interviewing him --

they don't think he had anything to

do with it -- just to see if he

remembers anything unusual and all.

NELLE

People in town seem to wonder if he

was involved.

LAURA

That's been real hard for Danny.

TRUMAN

Oh, it's the hardest -- when people

have a notion about you and it's

impossible to convince them otherwise.

Since I was a child folks have thought

they had me pegged because of the

way I look and the way I talk. They're

always wrong.

(looks at her)

Do you know what I mean?

LAURA

I want to show you something.

TRUMAN

Not one person here understands her.

LAURA

Maybe you'll get a better picture of

Nancy. And the family.

NELLE

What is this?

LAURA

It's her diary.

CUT TO:

NELLE

"Danny here tonight and we watched

TV. So nice just having him sit with

us. Left at eleven. P.S. -- He's the

only one I really love."

NELLE

And that was that.

TRUMAN

The end of a life.

CUT TO:

NELLE

"Shattered."

TRUMAN

"Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible

ever happened to him before. "

TRUMAN

I have 94 percent recall of all

conversations.

NELLE

94 percent.

TRUMAN

I've tested myself.

NELLE

(scans some of what

he's written)

I hate that you're better than me at

this.

NELLE

Don't you dare close your eyes on my

bed.

NELLE

Stand up and walk out that door. Go

to your room if you're gonna sleep.

Truman. Truman.

NELLE

Crap.

FADE OUT.

NELLE

What right do you have being tired?

You were snoring blissfully --

TRUMAN

I don't snore --

NELLE

-- while I lay there, hating you --

TRUMAN

You don't hate me.

NELLE

Not much.

(She sits. Truman

holds out a NOTE)

What?

(takes it, looks)

Marie Dewey?... We've got somewhere

to go for Thanksgiving supper.

TRUMAN

Apparently Detective Foxy's wife has

a better opinion of me than Detective

Foxy.

CUT TO:

MARIE

You came.

NELLE

Hi.

TRUMAN

(soberly)

Thank you for having us.

MARIE

(mock serious)

Thank you.

(then:)

Get yourselves in here.

(turns and walks into

the house)

Alvin! Get your pants on. They're

here.

TRUMAN

More. More.

MARIE

Alvin will hate this.

TRUMAN

Yes, but we who know the truth will

love it.

MARIE

(laughs)

I have to stop.

(then)

I cannot believe you're from New

Orleans. I miss it so much.

TRUMAN

I only lived there for a short while

but my Mama was born and bred.

MARIE

You know something -- Alvin pretends

he doesn't know who you are, but the

minute you came to town he read your

books. He had one of his men pick up

"Breakfast at Tiffany's" in Kansas

City 'cause it's banned from the

library here.

TRUMAN

What did Mr. Dewey think?

MARIE

He liked it more than he's willing

to admit.

TRUMAN

How very foxy.

TRUMAN

Mama would've put in half the bottle

by now.

MARIE

Alright, one more shake.

TRUMAN

Hello.

NELLE

Hi.

MARIE

How you doing, foxy?

TRUMAN

I was writing the script as they

were filming, all that time in Italy.

I'd work like mad all day long and

then dash down to the bar around

midnight to hand in the next day's

scenes. Humphrey had just about moved

into the hotel bar --

MARIE

(whispers to Alvin)

Humphrey Bogart.

TRUMAN

-- where he and John drank every

night --

MARIE

(to Alvin)

John Huston.

TRUMAN

-- and I mean drank, like famished

water buffaloes. Well -- I'd only

just handed them the final scene

when the bellhop told me I had a

phone call. It was my stepfather,

Joe Capote, calling to say that my

mother had died. I flew home to New

York -- terribly distraught -- but

when I got to the apartment I could

see that Joe was in even worse shape

than I was. He grabbed my hands and

sat me down at the kitchen table,

and he said to me, "Talk. Talk about

anything, any subject in the world.

Don't worry whether it will interest

me or not. Just talk so I won't break

down." And I did. He couldn't bear

to be alone with his thoughts. It

was too painful.

MARIE

It's been a hard couple weeks for

Alvin. He and Herb Clutter were good

friends. From church.

DEWEY

Marie --

MARIE

Oh come on, Alvin. These are good

people.

TRUMAN

Who would put a pillow under the

boy's head just to shoot him? Why

would they tuck Nancy in?

DEWEY

(surprised by the

insight)

I want to know the same thing.

NELLE

Twisted notion of tenderness.

CUT TO:

NELLE

Thank you.

MARIE

So many of my friends would love to

meet you.

NELLE

That'd be fine --

TRUMAN

(to Dewey)

You don't have to worry. I'm not

going to write about this until

everything's over.

DEWEY

I'm not worried. I know what room

you're in at the hotel. And I know

where you live in Brooklyn.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HOLT

(re the apples)

I'd of picked them up but I haven't

been myself. Mind you, I make the

walk out here every day, check the

house, make sure the pipes don't

freeze -- that sort of item. The

least I can do for Mr. Clutter.

NELLE

How long have you worked here?

HOLT

1940 -- a lotta years. The wife too,

cleaning the house. Cooking.

NELLE

Well, she's marvelous. Lunch was

wonderful.

HOLT

(ignoring this)

She had a hard job after what all

happened. Cleaning. I burned most of

the rest -- mattresses -- too far of

a mess.

(then, looks at them)

I've asked around some -- if anyone's

looking for a strong hand.

HOLT

I don't think they'll be able to

sell the place till they catch the

ones that did it.

(beat)

That's what I hear anyhow.

CUT TO:

JACK

You're celebrating.

TRUMAN

Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent

me in New York?

JACK

Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird.

You said it was good.

TRUMAN

And I was right. She just heard

Lipincott wants to publish it.

JACK

(pause)

Well. Jesus. That's terrific. Tell

her congratulations.

TRUMAN

Congratulations.

(covers phone, mouths

to Nelle:)

Jealous.

JACK

Just promise you'll be home by

Christmas.

TRUMAN

I can't leave now Jack -- I mean it

was hard at first, but now I'm

practically the mayor.

JACK

Alright.

TRUMAN

I want to come home -- I do. Though

if they catch whoever did this, who

knows what -- I'll probably be here

til next Christmas.

JACK

Right. I'll let you go.

TRUMAN

Jack, we'll go away this spring to

write. Maybe Spain...

JACK

Alright, Truman.

TRUMAN

Bye.

(hangs up)

The poor boy misses me.

NELLE

Truman.

TRUMAN

Nelle.

NELLE

You remember when we were kids?

TRUMAN

I was never a kid. I was born fully

formed.

NELLE

I had no idea what a homosexual was.

But I knew whatever they were, you

were one of 'em.

MAN IN HALL (O.S.)

Oh. Uh. Oh. Excuse us.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

(quickly, as if

reciting)

-- girdle up -- no extra bulges --

if you're dressed right for him when

he gets home, the evening should be

smooth sailing. Bon voyage, gals.

MARIE

I can't believe you got this whole

page -- I only read it to you once!

TRUMAN

I've trained myself.

NELLE

...trained myself.

TRUMAN

I have 94 percent

recall.

NELLE

...94 percent recall.

TRUMAN

(laughing)

You cut that out.

MARIE

You believe that Alvin?

ALVIN

Impressive.

MARIE

I'm sorry. He's upset.

(stubs out cigarette)

-- smoking three packs a day.

(then)

Two men did it. They know who. One

of them used to have a cellmate who

gave him up for the thousand dollar

reward. They passed through Kansas

City last week writing bad checks --

by the time Alvin's boys got up there

they'd skipped out again.

NELLE

Where to?

MARIE

They have no idea.

DEWEY

Alvin. Paul. Now.

DEWEY

Damnit.

(gets up, goes)

Come here.

MARIE

Alvin ...

DEWEY (O.S.)

Alvin Jr. Get over here.

ALVIN JR. (O.S.)

Dad, the phone.

DEWEY (O.S.)

Paul. Back to the table.

DEWEY

Sit.

ALVIN JR.

Dad?

MARIE

Tell them we're at dinner, Alvin.

ALVIN JR.

Dad?

DEWEY

Not now, Alvin.

ALVIN JR.

You need to call the Chief of Police

in Las Vegas when you have a minute.

FADE OUT:

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

...This is KERG radio, Garden City.

A friendly broadcast from a friendly

place. Our lead story:

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

...newsmen from six states have joined

scores of Kansans as they await the

arrival of confessed killers Perry

Smith and Richard Hickock. KBI

officers have been driving the Clutter

family's brutal killers nonstop

from...

NELLE

Hey.

MARIE

(whispers to Truman)

Motorcycle accident. He broke them

and they never healed right.

(Truman looks at her)

Alvin told me.

FADE OUT:

DOROTHY

Truman Capote.

TRUMAN

Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd

be left alone this morning by that

hard-working husband of yours.

(holds up bag)

So I have breakfast.

(holds up paper)

I have news.

(book)

And I have literature. My friend

Jack mailed me the book you wanted.

DOROTHY

"For the maiden of the Midwest, the

priestess of the plains, the queen

of the kitchen: my first novel.

Truman."

DOROTHY

You're too much. Go on into the living

room, lemme grab that -- it's been

ringing all morning.

DOROTHY

Oh. Truman. I meant in there.

(points to living

room)

I... um...

DOROTHY

It's the women's cell. It's hardly

ever used. But they wanted to, um,

separate... Please. Let's sit in the

living room. I'll set up in the living

room.

DOROTHY

Come.

TRUMAN

They put you in the women's cell.

PERRY

Among other indignities.

TRUMAN

Well... she's a good cook.

PERRY

She's scared of me.

TRUMAN

I think so am I. A little bit.

PERRY

Are you?

(a moment, then:)

You have any aspirin? My legs --

DOROTHY

Um. Truman? All set.

TRUMAN

I'm sorry.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

(murmurs)

His feet don't touch the floor.

JUDGE TATE

In the matter of the State of Kansas

v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry

Edward Smith this Court has been

informed by counsel -- Mr. Weeks --

that defendants wish to waive their

right to Preliminary Hearing. Mr.

Hickock, is that your wish?

HICKOCK

(unconvincing)

Yessir. Yes.

TRUMAN

Why are they doing that?

JUDGE TATE

Mr. Smith.

PERRY

(stands... then:)

I ask that the waiver be effectuated.

JUDGE TATE

So noted.

(bangs gavel)

We're adjourned.

CUT TO:

DOROTHY

Mr. Capote.

TRUMAN

(offers pie)

Madame Sanderson.

DOROTHY

Is that for the two of us to share?

Or for me to eat alone while you

talk to our guest?

TRUMAN

Was it your choice to waive the

hearing?

TRUMAN

You still need some?

(Perry doesn't move)

Give me your hand.

PERRY

I could kill you if you got too close.

TRUMAN

Would you like some water?

TRUMAN

Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book --

PERRY

He said we'd curry favor with the

Judge if we waived our rights.

TRUMAN

Who did?

PERRY

The lawyer.

TRUMAN

Okay.

PERRY

Your picture's undignified. People

recall first impressions.

TRUMAN

What's been your first impression?

PERRY

You want something.

TRUMAN

From you?

DOROTHY

Truman. Walter's gonna be home soon.

TRUMAN

(to Perry)

I just want permission to talk.

(then)

Has anyone else visited?

DOROTHY

Truman --

TRUMAN

Will you tell me if you need anything?

I can have whatever you want sent

from New York.

(no answer)

Will you do that?

CUT TO:

SHAWN

William Shawn.

TRUMAN (OVER PHONE)

Gorgeous?

SHAWN

Truman.

TRUMAN

I'm writing a book. It's too much

for a single article -- this town,

the killers most of all -- you will

be stunned by Perry Smith --

SHAWN

Why? What has he --

TRUMAN

Not much yet, but I know. I can sense

him. He's desperately lonely,

frightened... I have questions --

are you ready?

SHAWN

Would it matter --

TRUMAN

How much more money can you send me?

How quickly can you get Dick Avedon

out here to take some pictures?

CUT TO:

HICKOCK

Perry, honey. You look terrific...

HICKOCK

Calm yourself down, sweetheart.

HICKOCK

Be patient, Capote. Maybe later

they'll send you my skin.

TRUMAN

I have the perfect place for it,

over the hearth.

CUT TO:

NELLE

Where'd Perry get the art set?

JUDGE TATE

Members of the jury. Have you reached

a verdict?

FOREMAN

(stands)

Yes sir.

JUDGE TATE

Defendants rise.

JUDGE TATE

Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene

Hickock stand accused of four counts

of the crime of murder in the first

degree. Have you reached a unanimous

verdict?

FOREMAN

We have, your honor.

JUDGE TATE

What is your verdict?

FOREMAN

Guilty. On all counts.

JUDGE TATE

Have you unanimously reached a

sentence.

FOREMAN

We have, your honor.

JUDGE TATE

What is the sentence?

FOREMAN

Death.

JUDGE TATE

Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene

Hickock. You've been found guilty of

four counts of murder in the first

degree. You will be taken to the

state penitentiary at Lansing. No

later than midnight, May 13 of this

year, nineteen hundred and sixty,

each of you will be hanged by the

neck until dead. So ordered.

HICKOCK

Alright, partner. Least now we're

not the only killers in Kansas.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

You think he slept at all?

TRUMAN

I need to see him before we go.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

They're going to transfer you up to

Lansing today. You'll have to make

sure to put me on the visitor's list.

Otherwise I can't see you.

TRUMAN

Will you do that? I'm going to help

find you a proper lawyer. You need a

serious lawyer for an appeal.

(no response)

They took Dick last night. I need

you to get him to do the same thing --

put me on the visitor's list. Will

you do that, Perry?

TRUMAN

Perry.

FADE OUT.

BEN BARON

Nelle. Kudos on "Kill the Bird." Is

that it?

NELLE

Close enough. Thanks.

SHAWN

He hasn't written a word yet, though

he says it's the nonfiction book of

the decade...

TRUMAN (O.S.)

He's little, but terrifying --

TRUMAN

He's as short as I am. And almost as

pretty. I'd be with him right now

but he's being given new

accommodations --

TRUMAN

Most people assume he's a monster. I

don't see him that way. The book I'm

writing will return him to the realm

of humanity -- it's the book I was

always meant to write...

JACK

Watch out. This is the start of a

great love affair.

NELLE

Oh yes. Truman in love with Truman.

TRUMAN

...I was in Marilyn's apartment just

last week. I had to break it to her

that, of the four Matisses hanging

on her wall, two were upside down.

TRUMAN

Another.

(to reporter)

To answer your question, I'm following

"Breakfast at Tiffany's" by blazing

a different path -- by inventing an

entirely new kind of writing: the

non-fiction novel.

REPORTER

You have a subject?

TRUMAN

On the night of November 14, two men

broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas

and murdered an entire family. Why

did they do that? It's been suggested

that this subject is tawdry -- it's

not worthy of literature. I disagree.

Two worlds exist in this country --

the quiet conservative life, and the

life of those two men -- the

underbelly, the criminally violent.

Those worlds converged that bloody

night. I spent the past three months

interviewing everyone in Kansas

touched by that violence. I spent

hours talking to the killers -- and

I'll spend more.

(waiter brings his

drink)

Researching this work has changed my

life, altered my point of view about

almost everything. I think those who

read it will be similarly affected.

(he sips)

Such a book can only be written by a

journalist who has mastered the

techniques of fiction --

REPORTER

You're speaking of yourself.

TRUMAN

You're really very clever.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

Perry's decided to appeal. He claims

their attorney was incompetent --

that he never raised the issue of

temporary insanity.

JACK

So you find them a new lawyer.

TRUMAN

They're facing execution in six weeks,

Jack. They need someone to argue

whether or not that's right.

JACK

Okay.

TRUMAN

I'd also like to see them alive,

yes, thank you very much. I need to

hear their story.

TRUMAN

If you met him you'd understand.

It's as if no-one's ever asked him a

single question about himself. He's

so... damaged -- and strange --

unexplored...

(then)

I don't trust this Hickock fellow.

Perry's the only person who can

describe to me what happened that

night. I need to hear him say it.

JACK

Just be careful what you do to get

what you want.

TRUMAN

I'm finding them a lawyer.

JACK

Truman. You're finding yourself a

lawyer.

CUT TO:

YOUNG PRISON GUARD

Warden Krutch will see you now.

KRUTCH

We do well by our boys. Showers once

a week. Feed em good. We'll be feeding

Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if

he don't eat. Get the food in through

his arm.

TRUMAN

What are you talking about?

KRUTCH

Hasn't eaten in a month. But it's

not his right to kill himself. It's

the People's right. The People of

this State. And that's who I work

for, the People. You can write any

of this down.

TRUMAN

No one told me.

KRUTCH

Yah. Won't eat.

TRUMAN

When can I see him?

KRUTCH

(checking desk calendar)

How about you come back Thursday?

TRUMAN

No. That's no good. I need to see

them now, then whenever I want for

as long as I want.

KRUTCH

Not how we do things here.

TRUMAN

I see.

TRUMAN

I understand what a burden unlimited

visitation might be -- on this

institution, and on the People who

pay for it. I want to be clear that

I don't expect the citizens of

Leavenworth County to have to shoulder

that burden.

TRUMAN

To be dispensed as you see fit.

KRUTCH

I didn't know where to count your

boy -- being half-Indian. I did him

a favor though.

(points to race chart)

Counted him White.

TRUMAN

You're a kind and generous man.

CUT TO:

HICKOCK

My hero.

TRUMAN

Hello.

HICKOCK

Thanks for your help with the lawyer.

TRUMAN

That's fine.

HICKOCK

You must be desperate for a story to

come all the way out here.

YOUNG PRISON GUARD

Mr. Capote. You're entitled to go

in. You may, um, go in. If you wish.

HICKOCK

You want to see Perry. Go ahead.

TRUMAN

Thank you.

HICKOCK

Ask me, he's just trying to prove

the insanity defense.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

(to Perry)

I don't care what your plans are for

yourself...

TRUMAN

But you're gonna wake up enough to

tell me what you did with my tie.

TRUMAN

It's okay. It's Truman. It's your

friend.

TRUMAN

How'd you learn to draw like that?

CUT TO:

PERRY

Before she had us. Before she started

drinking.

TRUMAN

Who took care of you as a child?

PERRY

Orphanage. Me and Linda.

TRUMAN

That's your sister?

TRUMAN

We're not so different as you might

think. I was abandoned repeatedly as

a child. My mama'd drag me along to

some new town so she could take up

with another man she'd met. Night

after night she'd lock me in the

hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch

and tell the staff not to let me out

no matter what. I was terrified --

I'd scream my head off -- till finally

I'd collapse on the carpet next to

the door and fall asleep. After years

of this she just left me with

relatives in Alabama.

PERRY

Who raised you up?

TRUMAN

My Aunts.

(Perry nods)

That's when I met Nelle -- she lived

next door.

(looks again at the

photo, hands it back)

Your mother was Indian?

PERRY

Cherokee.

TRUMAN

Drinking was not a good thing for

her.

PERRY

No tolerance for it.

TRUMAN

And your father?

PERRY

No tolerance for him either.

TRUMAN

What I can't decide is if you

understand how fascinating you are.

PERRY

I'm sorry about your tie. They took

it away from me because we're all on

suicide watch. It's why the lights

stay on at night.

TRUMAN

I hope we're past that now. You had

me worried.

PERRY

Okay.

TRUMAN

I don't care about the tie. It's

just a pity because it looked so

good on you.

PERRY

Be careful of Ricardo. I think he

wants you all to himself.

TRUMAN

Alright --

PERRY

But he's naturally mendacious -- not

to be trusted -- if he had a hundred

dollars he'd steal a stick of chewing

gum.

TRUMAN

You wouldn't.

TRUMAN

I want to take your notebooks with

me -- I want to read them.

TRUMAN

If I leave here without understanding

you, the world will always see you

as a monster. I don't want that -- I

don't see you that way.

PERRY

I tracked my father down in Alaska.

I was 14. One day I said to him,

"Mom's dead." I could see it. A week

later we got the news. She finally

drunk herself to death.

TRUMAN

This is remarkable.

PERRY

Sometimes you see a thing -- how it

really is.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

He trusts me -- that's why he gave

it to me. He's given me absolutely

everything.

(paging through Diary)

You should see his drawings, Nelle,

how good he is. He wants so badly to

be taken seriously, to be held in

some esteem.

NELLE

Do you?

TRUMAN

Do I what?

NELLE

Hold him in esteem?

TRUMAN

Well... he's a gold mine. I mean

he's told me his entire life, and

now it's all here for me to write

down -- All of the history I need.

His entire life in this Diary. His

dead mother. A brother and sister

killed themselves.

NELLE

You tell him your mama did the same

thing?

TRUMAN

I tell him everything. We've been

talking our heads off the past month.

Sometimes, when I think how good my

book can be, I can hardly breathe.

NELLE

Huh.

TRUMAN

(finds what he wants)

Here's what I wanted to read to you:

"If Called Upon to Make a Speech:" --

this is exactly what I was talking

about -- a speech just in case he's

ever recognized for an achievement:

"If Called Upon to Make a Speech: I

can't remember what I was going to

say for the life of me. I don't think

ever before have so many people been

so directly responsible for my being

so very, very glad. It's a wonderful

moment and a rare one. Thank you!"

(beat)

There's an exclamation point on the

end of that thank you, in case you

didn't catch it...

(silence)

Where'd you go?

NELLE

Christ. I guess it stopped being

funny.

TRUMAN

I never said it was.

(turns a page)

Listen to this...

DEWEY

(to waitress)

Thanks.

DEWEY

You're nothing if not hard-working.

TRUMAN

You look good, healthy again.

DEWEY

Not a chance.

TRUMAN

I've decided on a title for my book.

I think you'll like it -- very

masculine. "In Cold Blood."

DEWEY

(lights the cigarette)

That refers to the crime or the fact

that you're still talking to the

criminals?

TRUMAN

The former, among other things.

DEWEY

I see.

TRUMAN

I've been wanting to ask if you'll

let me look at your investigation

notes.

DEWEY

That lawyer you helped find for your

friends got them a hearing at the

Kansas Supreme Court --

TRUMAN

I heard this morning.

DEWEY

-- on the issue of inadequate counsel.

TRUMAN

Alvin. Do you not want me to look at

your notes? You are permitted to say

no.

DEWEY

(rises, takes out

wallet)

I'll tell you what: if those boys

get off, I'm coming to Brooklyn to

hunt you down.

DEWEY

I have to be in court at nine o'clock.

DEWEY

Call Roy Church. He'll show you what

you want to see.

CUT TO:

HICKOCK

Hey, hey...

PERRY

Thank you.

TRUMAN

It was as much for me as for anyone.

I couldn't bear the thought of losing

you so soon.

PERRY

We're going to be able to use your

book for our case. You'll write we

never got to raise our insanity plea.

You wrote how terrible the lawyer

was?

TRUMAN

I haven't written a word yet.

PERRY

What have you been doing?

TRUMAN

Research. Waiting to talk to you.

PERRY

All right.

TRUMAN

I had hoped --

PERRY

What are you calling it?

TRUMAN

The book?

(looks directly at

him)

I have no idea.

TRUMAN

If I'm going to write about you --

if I'm going to determine how to

write about you -- you need to tell

me about that night at the Clutter

house.

TRUMAN

Perry.

TRUMAN

Why? Do you worry what I'll think?

TRUMAN

Is that it?

PERRY

Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.

TRUMAN

I know a lot of people.

TRUMAN

What is that you keep drawing?

PERRY

You must hate having to come to this

place --

TRUMAN

Perry, I have invitations to be in

Morocco, Greece... I choose to be

here. Those people have everything,

all their prayers have been answered,

yet they're more desperate than ever.

I prefer to be here with you.

PERRY

(looks at Truman;

evenly)

I was ten, I wet the bed, the nuns

at the orphanage hated the smell.

First month one of them found me

shivering -- just trying to get

through the night. The Sister pulled

back the covers and shined her

flashlight to see what I'd did. The

sheets were wet. She hit me so many

times with that flashlight she broke

it.

(he shrugs)

That night I dreamed about the yellow

bird. Tall. Yellow like the sun. It

picked me up and it clawed the Nun's

eyes and it lifted me into the sky.

TRUMAN

I'm just missing this one piece,

Jack. Be patient with me.

JACK

How long is that gonna take? Why

don't you try leaving him alone for

a while? Come to Spain. You can always

visit him later.

TRUMAN

I don't know.

JACK

Well, I'm off. I've got my own writing

to do.

TRUMAN

Do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.

JACK

Too many people around.

(beat)

I'll leave the address on the kitchen

table. Truman, what do you do there

when you're not with him? -- It must

be awful.

JACK

Think about what I said. Join me

when you can.

TRUMAN

I will. I will. Bye.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PERRY

I didn't see you. Jesus, you...

(stands, tucks in

shirt)

Come in. Where's the guard?

TRUMAN

I can't. I brought you some things,

but I have to fly back East.

PERRY

When?

TRUMAN

An hour. I'm sorry.

PERRY

You can't.

TRUMAN

I'm sorry.

PERRY

Who are you going there to see --

HICKOCK (O.S.)

(from next cell)

Capote, get it straight in your book --

we never intended on killing that

family --

PERRY

I told him that.

HICKOCK (O.S.)

No premeditation --

PERRY

I told him!

TRUMAN

Your writings are magnificent. I

hope these help you do more.

TRUMAN

I have so much material -- from the

trial, from our visits, your journals.

I have to organize it all, and I

have to start the process of writing.

(no response)

I'll visit soon. Perhaps this fall.

(backing away)

I miss you already. Write me every

five minutes.

HICKOCK (O.S.)

Be good now.

FADE OUT.

FADE OUT.

TRUMAN

What.

SHAWN (OVER PHONE)

Truman. I was supposed to be home

for dinner with my wife three hours

ago -- I have not been able to tear

myself away from your book. It's

that good. It's not good, it's

astonishing. This first half is

astonishing. If the second half lives

up to this it, -- it -- how much is

left to do?

TRUMAN

I'm already well into the third part,

but I -- I can't finish that till I

convince Perry to describe the night

of the killings to me. I was planning

to visit this fall, see --

SHAWN

I think you need to talk to him now.

TRUMAN

And we all need to see how this ends

for the final part. I can't finish

the book till I know what happens.

If Perry and Dick are executed it's

one thing -- and if not, well --

SHAWN

Truman. You got your ending --

TRUMAN

I really don't know --

SHAWN

The Kansas court denied their appeal.

It came over the wire on Friday. You

need to talk to Perry now. He'll be

dead by September. I'm sorry, I know

how much you've come to care about

him.

SHAWN

Truman?

TRUMAN

Right. Yes. Right.

SHAWN

I want to set up a reading for you

in the fall, in New York. We'll build

some interest, and we'll publish in

the fall.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

Plums. Thank god. We have nothing in

the house.

TRUMAN

Why aren't you working?

JACK

I knew you couldn't be depended on

to stock the kitchen.

JACK

What would we feed our famous guest?

TRUMAN

Oh, Jesus. I completely forgot.

JACK

(utterly nonchalant)

Plus -- I finished my novel yesterday.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

My man, my hero, my talented... My

man...

JACK

You said that.

TRUMAN

You are the hardest worker, the most

unsung talent I know. As Nelle passes

by on her way to London to sell her

book which needs no selling, may a

little of her success rub off on

both of us.

JACK

Here, here!

CUT TO:

NELLE

(to Truman)

When was the last time you wrote

back to him?

TRUMAN

I don't know.

JACK

What's this?

NELLE

A letter for your boyfriend I was

asked to deliver.

TRUMAN

From Perry.

JACK

Let's have it.

NELLE

"Dear Friend Truman. Where are you?

Read this item in a medical

dictionary: "Death by hanging is

caused by asphyxia, by fracture of

the cervical vertebrae, by laceration

of the trachea." Not too comforting

as we lost our appeal. Missing you --

alone and desirous of your presence.

Your amigo, Perry."

TRUMAN

Mr. Shawn told me about the court

decision yesterday.

JACK

I was wondering why you were in such

a good mood. Surely, I thought, it's

not because I finished my little

book.

TRUMAN

That's a terrible thing to say.

TRUMAN

(to no one in

particular)

I used to write him all the time.

I've been so focused lately on the

book.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

Jack says I'm using Perry, but he

also thinks I fell in love with him

when I was in Kansas. How both of

those things can be true is beyond

me.

NELLE

Did you? Fall in love with him.

NELLE

Truman? --

TRUMAN

I don't know how to answer that...

It's as if Perry and I started life

in the same house. One day he stood

up and walked out the back door while

I walked out the front. With some

different choices, he's the man I

might have become.

NELLE

Are you kidding me?

NELLE

Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think

he's what I like about you best.

TRUMAN

(smiles)

I'll see you at the reading in New

York.

NELLE

The sixteenth.

NELLE

Truman. Honestly. Are you going back

to Kansas because you care about

Perry or because you need information

before he's killed?

TRUMAN

Can't it be both?

NELLE

No. I don't think it can be.

CUT TO:

HICKOCK (O.S.)

Hey, buddy. Thanks.

CUT TO:

PERRY

What was he in jail for?

TRUMAN

They said it was not paying his taxes.

But really for being an outsider --

refusing to go along.

TRUMAN

You don't have to read any of these

if you don't want to. But I thought

you'd like something decent. You're

much too smart for adventure

magazines.

ROW GUARD

Lock-down while Lowell goes to

solitary. Nobody in or out.

(to Truman)

You want in or out?

TRUMAN

In.

PERRY

Everyone says he's a genius. I don't

think he's a genius. He's rich and

he went to college -- like any of us

would've if we got the chance. He

came home for Christmas and shot his

parents --

TRUMAN

-- in front of the television.

PERRY

You remember the story --

TRUMAN

They were watching Father Knows Best.

PERRY

I won't be sorry to see him go. Always

correcting my grammar.

PERRY

Now -- Dick and me -- we're next in

line.

TRUMAN

I'm so sorry I've been away.

PERRY

It was a long time.

TRUMAN

I know.

PERRY

I wish you could come next week,

when they take him out to the Corner,

but the whole prison shuts down.

TRUMAN

I have to be in New York anyway.

PERRY

How's the book going?

TRUMAN

Very slowly.

PERRY

Will you show it to me?

TRUMAN

I've hardly written anything.

GUARD #1

Ready.

HICKOCK

Keep your head high, buddy.

ANDREWS

Alright now.

HICKOCK

...or they won't be able to rope you

under your fat fucking chin.

ANDREWS

Next!

BEN BARON

(loudly, over the

hubbub)

Hello Hollywood. That's quite a bundle

you sold your book for.

NELLE

Well...

NELLE

What a gentleman.

YOUNG ASSISTANT

Mr. Capote. Can I get you anything?

TRUMAN

No.

(clears his throat)

Thank you.

SHAWN (O.S.)

Welcome New Yorkers...

SHAWN (O.S.)

Thank you for coming to the first

public reading, the first offering

of any kind, of Truman Capote's new

work "In Cold Blood." Our magazine --

TRUMAN

Hello. My name is Truman Capote.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

Perry Smith's voice was both gentle

and prim -- a voice that, though

soft, manufactured each sound exactly --

ejected it like a smoke ring issuing

from a parson's mouth.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TRUMAN (V.O.)

The village of Holcomb stands on the

high wheat plains of western Kansas,

a lonesome area that other Kansans

call "out there." Until one morning

in mid-November 1959, few Americans --

in fact, few Kansans -- had ever

heard of Holcomb. Like the waters of

the [Arkansas] river, like the

motorists on the highway...

exceptional happenings had never

stopped there.

TRUMAN

The four coffins, which quite filled

the small, flower-crowded parlor,

were to be sealed at the funeral

services -- very understandably, for

the effect... was disquieting. Nancy

wore her dress of cherry-red velvet,

her brother a bright plaid shirt;

the parents were more sedately

attired, Mr. Clutter in navy-blue

flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe;

and -- and it was this especially

that lent the scene an awful aura --

the head of each was completely

encased in cotton, a swollen cocoon

twice the size of an ordinary blown-

up balloon, and the cotton, because

it had been sprayed with a glossy

substance, twinkled like Christmas-

tree snow.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

Imagination, of course, can open any

door -- turn the key and let terror

walk right in. [One] Tuesday, at

dawn, a carload of... strangers,

ignorant of the local disaster --

were startled by what they saw as

they crossed the prairies and passed

through Holcomb: windows ablaze,

almost every window in almost every

house, and, in the brightly lit rooms,

fully clothed people, even entire

families, who had sat the whole night

wide awake, watchful, listening. Of

what were they frightened? "It might

happen again."

CUT TO:

LITERARY ENTHUSIAST

Your portrait of those men was

terrifying. Terrifying.

TRUMAN

Thank you.

ISHERWOOD

Your hairpiece is terrifying.

TRUMAN

I was going to say the same thing!

CUT TO:

SHAWN

Everyone was there.

TRUMAN

Tennessee loved it.

SHAWN

Of course he did.

TRUMAN

Should we do more? I was terrified,

but --

SHAWN

No, Now we get to withhold while

everyone else talks. Let them do the

work.

SHAWN

This book is going to change

everything. It'll change how people

see you as a writer. It'll change

how people write. You'll finish by

October?

TRUMAN

I think so. You know they're scheduled

for next month?

SHAWN

Hanging. Yes. I'll commit as many

issues as it takes to publish. Three.

As many as it takes.

TRUMAN

I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll

get Perry to talk --

SHAWN

Honestly, what's he got to lose?

TRUMAN

It really is too awful.

Institutionalized sadism.

SHAWN

You'll be able to finish now.

TRUMAN

As strange as it may sound to you,

I'm going to miss him.

FADE OUT.

TRUMAN

When did you hear?

PERRY

Two days ago.

PERRY

It's what we've been waiting for. A

stay of execution to make a federal

appeal.

PERRY

All thanks to you.

CUT TO:

PERRY

Kansas's had it in for me for ten

years -- in prison the first time,

at that trial, here. They can't corner

me now. Not till the U.S. Government

says so --

TRUMAN

Perry, sit down. For a minute.

(Perry sits)

I need you to talk to me...

PERRY

We've got all the time in the world

to talk. About everything. I've been

thinking about Ricardo. You need to

stop sending him those trashy books.

I won't even mention the pornography.

(getting up)

I realize he might have trouble

grasping the literature you gave me,

but those books only exacerbate the

problem -- only 'heighten' or

'intensify' it. Maybe we should start

him on a program...

TRUMAN

Perry.

PERRY

Give him the simple novels first --

TRUMAN

Perry.

TRUMAN

I know what exacerbate means.

PERRY

Okay. I thought in case...

TRUMAN

There is not a word, or a sentence,

or a concept, that you can illuminate

for me. There is one singular reason

that I keep coming here --

PERRY

Truman --

TRUMAN

...November 14th, 1959. Three years

ago. Three years. That's all I want

to hear from you.

PERRY

I've asked you not to --

TRUMAN

(stands up)

This is ridiculous.

(to the Guard)

I'm ready.

(to Perry)

I have a plane to catch. I found

your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll

talk to me about something useful.

PERRY

Don't go out there.

PERRY

Please don't go out there.

TRUMAN

This is my work, Perry. I'm working.

When you want to tell me what I need

to hear, you let me know.

CUT TO:

MRS. MURCHAK

They'll play outside a while longer.

MRS. MURCHAK

I don't want them to see that.

TRUMAN

They've never seen these pictures?

MRS. MURCHAK

(shakes her head)

Too many questions.

MRS. MURCHAK

June's dead. Frank shot himself. Now

Perry's did what he did. I suppose

I'm next. Some ruination will visit

me.

TRUMAN

I don't think life works that way.

MRS. MURCHAK

It does in this family.

MRS. MURCHAK

I used to love him. He was my little

doll.

MRS. MURCHAK

He scares me now.

TRUMAN

When was the last time you saw him?

MRS. MURCHAK

Ten years.

TRUMAN

Do you think I could borrow one of

those pictures?

MRS. MURCHAK

(hands it to him)

Take the whole thing. I don't want'em

anymore.

(then)

Just... Perry doesn't know where I

live. He thinks we're still in

Portland. Please don't tell him we're

not.

TRUMAN

(he already has)

Alright.

MRS. MURCHAK

Don't be taken in by my brother.

He's got this sensitive side he'll

show. You believe he's gentle, so

easily hurt. But he'd just as soon

kill you as shake your hand. I believe

that.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

Hello handsome.

ROW GUARD

You want to go in?

TRUMAN

Yes

PERRY

What's the name of your book?

PERRY

What's the name of your book?

TRUMAN

I don't...

PERRY

What's the name of your book?

TRUMAN

I don't know what you're talking

about.

PERRY

"Truman Capote read last night before

a packed audience from his non-fiction

book IN COLD BLOOD."

PERRY

More?

(reads)

"The true-crime novel tells of killers

Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, who

brutally murdered a Kansas family

three years ago."

TRUMAN

Who sent that to you?

TRUMAN

Who sent that to you?

PERRY

That's not your goddamn business.

TRUMAN

It is my business, because it's not

true. The organizers of the reading

needed a title. They picked one -- a

sensational one, I admit -- to attract

a crowd.

PERRY

They picked it.

TRUMAN

Yes.

PERRY

That's not your title.

TRUMAN

I haven't chosen one yet.

TRUMAN

How could I choose --

PERRY

You pretend to be my friend...

TRUMAN

How could I choose a title when you

still haven't told me what happened

that night? How could I? I couldn't

possibly.

TRUMAN

I have something from your sister.

TRUMAN

She misses you.

TRUMAN

It's alright. I'll go in.

TRUMAN

I'm sorry. I should have told you

what they made me call the book.

(touches Perry's arm)

I couldn't pretend to be your friend.

The truth is, I can't help wanting

to be.

(silence, then:)

You don't have to tell me anything

if you don't want to.

PERRY

Look at my belly.

PERRY

There must be something wrong with

us. To do what we did.

PERRY

We heard there was ten thousand

dollars in that house. Once we'd

tied up everybody and searched all

over, I knew the guy who told us

about it was wrong. There wasn't any

money. But Dick wouldn't believe it.

He went tearing through the house

again, banging on the walls, looking

for a safe. He said when he was done,

he was going to come up to Nancy's

room and have his way with her. I

wouldn't allow it. I told him that.

I sat with Nancy.

CUT TO:

PERRY (V.O.)

It was nice in there.

PERRY

Dick came to get me and we turned

out the lights and went down to the

basement, where we had Mr. Clutter

and the boy. Dick kept saying "No

witnesses." I figured if I just waited

him out he'd give up and leave them

tied up there. We'd drive all night,

they'd never find us. Mr. Clutter's

wrists were tied to a pipe over his

head. He looked like he was hurt, so

I cut him down.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

PERRY

We put a box there on the floor so

he'd be more comfortable. He asked

if his wife and daughter were alright

and I said they were fine, they were

ready to go to sleep. I told him it

wasn't long till morning when somebody

would find them.

(beat)

He was looking at me. Just... looking

at me. Looking at my eyes. Like he

expects me to kill him -- expects me

to be the kind of person who would

kill him. I was thinking -- this

nice man, he's scared of me. I was

ashamed. I mean, I thought he was a

kind man, a good... a gentleman. I

thought so right up to the moment I

cut his throat. I didn't realize

what I'd did till I heard the sound.

CUT TO:

PERRY (V.O.)

Like some one drowning under water.

CUT TO:

PERRY

I was staring at him, bleeding on

the floor. I told Dick to finish him

off, but he wouldn't do it. We

couldn't leave Mr. Clutter like that,

so I got the shotgun.

CUT TO:

PERRY (V.O.)

We went to Mrs. Clutter's room.

CUT TO:

PERRY

Then we drove off.

PERRY

What do you think of me now?

TRUMAN

Added up, how much money did you get

from the Clutters?

PERRY

Between forty and fifty dollars.

FADE OUT:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

Jack.

TRUMAN

Jack.

FADE OUT.

TRUMAN (V.O.)

...I want to give it to you. The

truth is, I'm desperate to be done

with it...

TRUMAN

Mr. Shawn, I... I've spent four years

of my life on this book... They got

a stay of execution yesterday...

Another, yes....

TRUMAN

Supreme Court....

TRUMAN

...It's harrowing -- all I want is

to write the ending and there's no

fucking end in sight... No. No, I

haven't been drinking again...

JACK

I don't know how you can eat that.

Perhaps if you weren't drinking so

much you wouldn't have to.

JACK

(reads)

"Dear friend Truman. Haven't heard

from you in such a long while. Please

help find new lawyer. If not, Dick

will have to write Supreme Court

brief himself. Our last appeal. What

a pair of wretched creatures. Please

help. Your amigo? Perry."

JACK

Your amigo.

TRUMAN

Put it with the others.

JACK

You tried?

JACK

(walking out)

You need to get ready.

CUT TO:

JACK

At least pretend for Nelle that you're

having a good time tonight.

CUT TO:

TRUMAN

Nelle.

NELLE

I thought I'd find you here.

TRUMAN

(to the bartender)

Please, another.

NELLE

How are you?

TRUMAN

Terrible.

NELLE

I'm sorry to hear that.

TRUMAN

Well. It's torture. Torture...

(he drinks)

...what they're doing to me.

NELLE

Uh-huh.

TRUMAN

Now the Supreme Court. Can you believe

it? If they win this appeal I will

have a complete nervous breakdown. I

may never recover. Just pray things

turn my way.

NELLE

It must be hard.

TRUMAN

It's torture. They're torturing me.

NELLE

I see.

NELLE

And how'd you like the movie, Truman.

TRUMAN

I frankly don't know what the fuss

is about.

FADE OUT.

TRUMAN

Hello.

OPERATOR (OVER PHONE)

Mr. Capote?

TRUMAN

Yes?

OPERATOR

I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith

in the Kansas Correctional System.

Will you accept charges?

OPERATOR

Mr. Truman Capote?

TRUMAN

Yes.

OPERATOR

Will you accept charges?

TRUMAN

Oh.

(no way out of this)

Uh... Yes.

OPERATOR

You'll accept charges?

TRUMAN

Yes.

OPERATOR

Mr. Smith, you're on the line.

PERRY (OVER PHONE)

Hello.

PERRY

Hello? I can't --

(to someone)

This doesn't seem --

(we hear Perry clicking

the cradle, then:)

Operator, I don't think you put me --

TRUMAN

I'm here.

PERRY

Truman.

TRUMAN

Hello, Perry.

PERRY

They let me make a couple phone calls

before I go down to Holding... You

heard the Supreme Court rejected the

appeal.

TRUMAN

I didn't... I hadn't heard that.

PERRY

Yeah.

TRUMAN

I'm sorry.

PERRY

Yeah. They let me make two phone

calls.

PERRY

We've got a date set for the

Warehouse, Dick and me. Two weeks

and... Finito. April 14.

PERRY

Will you visit me? Truman. Will you

come visit?

TRUMAN

I don't know if I can. I'll try.

(beat)

I don't know if I can.

GUARD IN BACKGROUND (OVER PHONE)

Time, Smith. Hang it up.

PERRY

Please visit me, Truman. Just...

GUARD IN BACKGROUND (OVER PHONE)

Time. Smith.

CUT TO:

GUARD

Ready.

CUT TO:

KRUTCH

Perry.

KRUTCH

You're allowed three names of people

you'd like to witness tomorrow. If

there's anybody you want, tell me

now.

PERRY

Truman Capote.

KRUTCH

Anybody else?

CUT TO:

SHAWN

You want anything?

CUT TO:

PERRY

Thank you.

(then)

You sent the telegram to his hotel?

GUARD

Hours ago.

PERRY

May I make a phone call?

CUT TO:

SHAWN

That's him again.

SHAWN

We've never even met. It is utterly

inappropriate for me to be talking

to him.

SHAWN

Yes... I'm sorry, he's out, gone

out... I'm not sure when...

CUT TO:

KRUTCH

You got a telex.

KRUTCH

"Perry. Unable to visit today because

not permitted. Always your friend,

Truman."

(apologetically)

That's it.

PERRY

It's not true, is it?

CUT TO:

NELLE (ON PHONE)

Mr. Shawn? It's Nelle... I just got

this telegram, has he seen it?

SHAWN (ON PHONE)

He won't look at it.

NELLE

Would you put him on please?

SHAWN

He won't talk.

NELLE

(calmly)

Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him

down and put the phone on his ear, I

need to speak to him.

SHAWN

It's Nelle.

NELLE (OVER PHONE)

Truman.

CUT TO:

PERRY (V.O.)

"Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman

Capote: Sorry that Truman was unable

to make it here at the prison for a

brief word prior to necktie party...

PERRY (V.O.)

...Whatever his reason for not showing

up, I want him to know that I cannot

condemn him for it and understand...

PERRY (V.O.)

...Not much time left but want you

both to know that I've been sincerely

grateful for your friendship through

the years and everything else...

CUT TO:

PERRY (V.O.)

...I'm not very good at these

things....

PERRY (V.O.)

I have become extremely affectionate

toward you both. But, harness time.

Adios amigos. Your friend, Perry."

KRUTCH

I didn't think I'd be seeing you

again.

(then)

You can visit for a few minutes.

SHAWN

No.

TRUMAN

Come with me.

SHAWN

Truman. No.

KRUTCH

Five minutes.

HICKOCK

(without rancor)

He returns. Long time.

TRUMAN

I don't know what you must think of

me.

HICKOCK

You haven't been foremost on my mind

lately. As you can imagine.

PERRY

You got the letter?

TRUMAN

Yes.

PERRY

It's true. I mean I understand why

you didn't want to come. I wouldn't

be here either if I didn't have to.

HICKOCK

You got that right.

PERRY

You know Ricardo donated his eyes to

science? Next week, some blind man

will be seeing what Dick used to

see.

HICKOCK

(laughs)

He'd be better off the way he was.

What I've seen hasn't been so nice

to look at -- but I guess it's better

than nothing.

(he shrugs, to Truman)

They came around with a form.

(beat)

Hey. You'll be walking down the street

one day in Denver, wherever -- and

suddenly these eyes will be staring

at you. Wouldn't that be something?

TRUMAN

(quietly)

It would be.

KRUTCH

Time.

PERRY

You'll be watching?

TRUMAN

I don't know. Do you want me to?

PERRY

I'd like to have a friend there.

TRUMAN

Okay. Then I will.

PERRY

It's alright.

TRUMAN

I did everything I could.

PERRY

Okay.

TRUMAN

I truly did.

PERRY

I know.

TRUMAN

Goodbye, Perry.

PERRY

You're not rid of me yet. I'll see

you in a few minutes.

CUT TO:

PERRY

Nice to see you.

KRUTCH

Perry Edward Smith.

(reads)

"For the crime of murder in the first

degree, by order of the Court of

Finney County and the Supreme Court

of the sovereign State of Kansas,

you are sentenced to hang until you

die."

(then)

You can say something if you want.

PERRY

(quietly, to Krutch)

Is there anybody from the family

here?

KRUTCH

No.

PERRY

Well. Tell them...

(he look out at

everyone)

I can't remember what I was going to

say for the life of me...

CHAPLAIN

Though I walk through the valley of

the shadow of death, I will fear no

evil, for thou art with me.

CHAPLAIN

Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort

me.

CHAPLAIN

Thou preparest a table before me in

the presence of mine enemies. Thou

annointest my head with oil.

CHAPLAIN

My cup runneth over.

FADE OUT.

NELLE

Hello.

TRUMAN

Someday I'll tell you about it. For

the moment, I'm too shattered.

NELLE

They're dead, Truman. You're alive.

TRUMAN

It was a terrible experience and I

will never get over it.

(then)

There wasn't anything I could have

done to save them.

NELLE

Maybe not.

NELLE

But the fact is, you didn't want to.

FADE OUT.

SHAWN

It came to the hotel this morning. I

told them I'd give it to you.

PERRY (V.O.)

Did we not know we were to die, we

would be children. By knowing it, we

are given the opportunity to mature

in spirit...

PERRY (V.O.)

Some take that opportunity. I hope I

have...

PERRY

Life is only the father of wisdom.

Death is the mother.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
