ANGELA (O.S.)

My God, it's hot. I stepped out of

the shower and stared sweating again.

... It's still burning? Jesus, it's

bigger! And I thought you were making

me hear those sirens.

(she giggles)

What is it?

RACINE

The Seawater Inn. My family used to

eat dinner there twenty-five years

ago. Now somebody's torched it to

clear the lot.

ANGELA (O.S.)

That's a shame.

RACINE

Probably one of my clients.

ANGELA (O.S.)

I'm leaving.

RACINE

(back still turned)

It's four a.m.

ANGELA

I go on duty at Miami Airport at

seven.

ANGELA (CONT'D)

I wouldn't mind having breakfast...

What do you care? You're watching

the fire. You're done with me. I'm

just getting into my uniform here...

ANGELA

You've had your fun. You're spent.

(trying for a

straight face)

I'll just slip into my uniform here

and slip away.

RACINE

My history's burning up out here.

ANGELA

Hey, I don't mind. I'm leaving.

Why do they make these damn skirts

so hard to zip...

RACINE

Where's your hat?

ANGELA (O.S.)

Hey... hey...

(giggling)

... don't wrinkle it!

RACINE (O.S.)

'You're spent.' Where'd you hear

that?

JUDGE COSTANZA

Mr. Racine, I do no longer care

whether these alleged toilets were

JUDGE COSTANZA (CONT'D)

ever actually en route from Indiana

or not. I think we're wasting our

time here. It's pretty clear your

client has attempted to defraud the

county in a not very ingenious manner.

(he nods at

Lowenstein)

The Assistant Prosecutor has made

what I consider a generous offer.

And given that you've failed to

generate even the semblance of a

defense --

RACINE

Judge Costanza, perhaps when I've

presented all --

JUDGE COSTANZA

Yeah, yeah. If I were you, I'd

recommend to your client that held

quickly do as Mr. Lowenstein here

has suggested -- plead nolo

contendre, file Chapter Eleven and

agree never to do business with

Okeelanta County again.

RACINE

You would look favorably on that?

JUDGE COSTANZA

(nods)

He can walk. But don't test my

patience for even five more minutes.

If he hesitates, I'll nail him.

RACINE

I'll talk to him.

JUDGE COSTANZA

Mr. Racine. Next time you come into

my courtroom I hope you've got either

a better defense or a better class

of client.

RACINE

Thank you, Your Honor.

LOWENSTEIN

-- I think I've underestimated you,

Ned. I don't know why it took me so

long. You've started using your

incompetence as a weapon.

RACINE

(smiles)

My defense was evolving. You guys

got scared. Costanza doesn't like

me. What'd I do to him?

LOWENSTEIN

He's an unhappy man, Thinks he should

be Circuit Court by now. Here he is

in a state with really top-notch

corruption and he's stuck with the

county toilets.

(he drinks)

I'm surprised you weren't in on that

toilet caper. Could have been that

quick score you've always been

searching for.

RACINE

Maybe Costanza was in on it.   That's

why he was mad.

STELLA

What's the word from the hallowed

halls of justice? Anything juicy?

LOWENSTEIN

Maybe Stella was in on it.

(finished his tea)

Stella, when you gonna get a real

air conditioner in here.

STELLA

You don't like it there's lots of

other places.

LOWENSTEIN

They don't have you. Gotta go.

LOWENSTEIN

You can't buy me. No sirree, I don't

come cheap.

A VOICE

Lowenstein, you're a fag.

STELLA

Why does he do that?

RACINE

He's pretty good, that's the weird

part.

STELLA

Did you hear about Dr. Block?

RACINE

No.   Do I want to?

STELLA

(leans toward him,

confidential)

Agnes Marshall.

RACINE

(the thought

disgusts him)

That must have been Mrs. Block's

idea, some kind of punishment.

STELLA

It was! How'd you know? Christ,

you're plugged in better than me.

So you must know about Mrs. Block's

friend in Ocean Grove.

RACINE

Stella, this is beneath even you.

Things must be slow.

STELLA

It's the heat.

RACINE

Mrs. Singer, I would have gladly

come to the house.

MRS. SINGER

No. no, the doctor says I should

walk and I had some shopping. Not

that that quack knows what he's

talking about. I tell you, Mr.

Racine, I'm not sure his testimony

is going to be very useful.

RACINE

Don't worry about it. I'll find you

a doctor who's more understanding.

Is it bad today?

MRS. SINGER

Oooh, you can't imagine. Nothing

can make up for the pain they've

caused me.

RACINE

How well I know. We'll sue those

reckless bastards dry. Excuse my

language.

Don't apologize. That's the kind of

RACINE

You can stand here with me if you

want, but you'll have to agree not

to talk about the heat.

MATTY

I'm a married woman.

RACINE

Meaning what?

MATTY

Meaning I'm not looking for company.

RACINE

Then you should have said -- 'I'm a

happily married woman.'

MATTY

That's my business.

RACINE

What?

MATTY

How happy I am.

RACINE

And how, happy is that?

MATTY

You're not too smart, are you?

MATTY

I like that in a man.

RACINE

What else you like -- Ugly?   Lazy?

Horny? I got 'em all.

MATTY

You don't look lazy.

MATTY

Tell me, does chat like that work

with most women?

RACINE

Some. If they haven't been around

much.

MATTY

I wondered. Thought maybe I was out

of touch.

RACINE

How 'bout I buy you a drink?

MATTY

I told you. I've got a husband.

RACINE

I'll buy him one too.

MATTY

He's out of town.

RACINE

My favorite kind. We'll drink to

him.

MATTY

He only comes up on the weekends.

RACINE

I'm liking him better all the time.

You better take me up on this quick.

In another forty-five minutes I'm

going to give up and walk away.

MATTY

You want to buy me something?   I'll

take one of these.

RACINE

What kind?

MATTY

Cherry.

RACINE

(to Matty)

You're not staying in Miranda Beach.

(she shakes her

head "no")

I would have noticed you.

MATTY

Is this town that small?

RACINE

Pinehaven. You're staying up in

Pinehaven, on the waterway.

(she gives him a

look, surprised)

You have a house.

MATTY

How'd you know?

RACINE

You look like Pinehaven.

MATTY

How does Pinehaven look?

RACINE

Well tended.

MATTY

Yes, I'm well tended, all right.

Well tended. What about you?

RACINE

Me? I need tending. I need someone

to take care of me. Rub my tired

muscles. Smooth out my sheets.

MATTY

Get married.

RACINE

I just need it for tonight.

MATTY

Good.    Nice move, Matty.

RACINE

Matty.    I like it. Right over your

heart.

MATTY

At least it's cool. I'm burning up.

RACINE

I asked you not to talk about the

heat.

MATTY

Would you get me a paper towel or

something? Dip it in some cold water.

RACINE

Right away.    I'll even wipe it off

for you.

You don't want to lick it?

Look who's here. Isn't this a

You're the one that doesn't want to

talk about the heat. Too bad. I'd

tell you about my chimes.

RACINE

What about them?

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               14.

MATTY

The wind chimes on my porch. They

keep ringing and I go out there

expecting a cool breeze. That's

what they've always meant. But not

this summer, This summer it's just

hot air.

RACINE

Do I remind you of hot air?

RACINE

Bourbon, any kind, on the rocks.

(to Matty)

Another?

MATTY

What are you doing in Pinehaven?

RACINE

I'm no yokel. Why, I was all the

way to Miami once.

MATTY

There are some men, once they get a

whiff of it, they'll trail you like

a hound.

RACINE

I'm not that eager.

MATTY

What is your name, anyway?

RACINE

(offers his hand)

Ned Racine.

MATTY

Matty Walker.

RACINE

Are you all right?

MATTY

(laughs)

Yes. My temperature runs a couple

degrees high. Around 100 all the

time I don't mind it. It's the engine

or something.

RACINE

Maybe you need a tune-up.

MATTY

Don't tell me -- you have just the

right tool.

RACINE

I don't talk that way.

MATTY

How'd you find me, Ned?

RACINE

This is the only joint in Pinehaven.

MATTY

How'd you know I drink?

RACINE

You seemed like a woman with all the

vices.

MATTY

(smiles)

You shouldn't have come. You're

going to be disappointed.

RACINE

(referring to the

men)

What'd I do?

MATTY

(indicating Racine's

chair)

A lot of them have tried that seat.

You're the first one I've let stay.

RACINE

(spotting a few

more)

You must come here a lot.

MATTY

Most men are little boys.

RACINE

Maybe you should drink at home.

MATTY

Too quiet.

RACINE

Maybe you shouldn't dress like that.

MATTY

This is a blouse and a skirt. I

don't know what you're talking about.

RACINE

You shouldn't wear that body.

MATTY

I don't like my body much.   It's

never been right.

MATTY

Sometimes, I don't know. I get so

sick of everything, I'm not sure I

care anymore. Do you know what I

mean, Ned?

RACINE

(he's not sure)

I know that sometimes the shit comes

down SO heavy I feel like I should

wear a hat.

MATTY

Yeah, that's what I mean.

MATTY

I think I'll get out of here now.

I'm going home.

RACINE

I'll take you.

MATTY

I have a car.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                   17.

RACINE

I'll follow you. I want to see the

chimes.

MATTY

You want to see the chimes.

RACINE

I want to hear them.

MATTY

That's all.   If I let you, that's

all.

RACINE

(gestures his

innocence)

I'm not looking for trouble.

MATTY

(very serious)

I mean it. I like you.    But my life

is complicated enough.

MATTY

This is my community bar. I might

have to come here with my husband

some time. Would you leave before

me?  Wait in your car? I know it

seems silly...

RACINE

I don't know who we're going to fool.

You've been pretty friendly.

MATTY

(steadily)

Now leave me alone.

Lady, you must be some kind of crazy!

No.

Boat.

MATTY

I think you should go now.

RACINE

I just got here.

MATTY

You've seen them. Please go.

RACINE

You didn't bring me here to see your

wind chimes.

MATTY

Yes, I did. I said what I meant.

Do you ever do that?

RACINE

No.     not very often.

You know, this has never been one of

my pleasures. Car. I considered

lonely life.

GRACE

Right. And it's gonna snow later

RACINE

How's the cop business, Oscar?

GRACE

Real good. Always starts hoppin' in

weather like this. When it gets hot,

people try to kill each other.

STELLA

It's true. I could tell you some

people who'll be dead if we don't

get a break soon.

GRACE

We've got more of everything bad

since the wave started. It's the

crisis atmosphere. People dress

different, feel different, sweat

more. They wake up cranky and they

never recover. Look at Lowenstein.

(a flash of smile)

Things are just a little askew. Pretty

soon people think the old rules aren't

in effect. They start breaking them.

Figure no one'll care, cause it's

emergency time... time out.

LOWENSTEIN

Oscar, I just don't understand how

you could be doing advanced

theoretical thinking like that and

still be stuck working in our little

town.

GRACE

Lowenstein dreams of bigger things.

LOWENSTEIN

Assistant County Prosecutor isn't

Hello, Ned.

RACINE

Hi, Glenda.

MATTY

Don't say it, if you don't mean it.

Please, Ned, don't.

RACINE

I do. I want you with me.

MATTY

I'm going to tell Edmund I want a

divorce. I won't stay any longer. I

would have, if you hadn't come along.

The life is comfortable. I was

willing to go on. But you've reminded

me of what it can be... I know now

that these last three years I've

been living half a life. It's my

fault, I don't deny it. You have to

let yourself be bought. I did. I

let it happen. I've lived so much of

my life with nothing. When you have

no money, you have no choices. I

don't care what they say -- money is

freedom. That's something they don't

teach you in school. But I found

out. And when Edmund came along when

I saw a chance to stop struggling I

took it. I'm not ashamed.

It is conceivable I'll make a buck

someday.

Oh, I know you will, darling. I didn't

mean that. I know you will. But it

That's all.

RACINE

Anyway, you'll come out all right.

MATTY

Of the divorce?

RACINE

Yeah.    He's ripe.

MATTY

No.   I signed a pre-nuptial agreement.

RACINE

What?

MATTY

He insisted. He blamed it on his

sister Roz -- she's always hated me --

but I know he wanted it too.

How is it?

MATTY

Bad. I get some money for a year.

Not much. That's it. But I don't

care, Ned. Not if I can be with you.

MATTY

Does it matter, Ned? Tell me the

RACINE

The truth? I wish you were going to

be loaded. Does it matter? No. No.

MATTY

(filtered, after a

No... I couldn't.

RACINE

Okay, I'm coming.

RACINE

How do you know?

MATTY

I saw the will once. He showed it

something ... how much he loved me

or something.

RACINE

How'd he get so fat?

MATTY

The stock market, investments, real

they own a lot of land along the

shore here.

RACINE

Who's "they"'

MATTY

(she doesn't know)

He's never introduced me to anyone.

I'm not sure if they're all

legitimate.

RACINE

(snorts at the

odds of that)

I wonder what they call themselves.

Maybe I've heard of them.

MATTY

They own that old place in Miranda

Beach, The Breakers... I know that.

RACINE

The Breakers? I thought Hermie Fisher

owned that land.

MATTY

Edmund mentioned it once.

MATTY

Ned, it scares me to talk about these

and ugly and It's what I most want.

RACINE

That's where we're at, isn't it,

Matty?

MATTY

What do you mean?

RACINE

That's what we're both thinking --

how good it'd be for us if he were

gone. It'd be real sweet for us.

MATTY

Don't talk about it, Ned. Please

don't. Talk is dangerous. Sometimes

it makes things happen, it makes it

real.

RACINE

Don't let it scare you. Because he's

not gonna die. There's nothing wrong

with him, is there? There's no reason

to think he's gonna die, is there?

RACINE

That's right. So we might as well

forget about it, It's not gonna just

happen to make things nice for us...

It won't just happen.

Mr. Racine is the lawyer I told you

(Walker doesn't

You remember. He had a client who

wanted to buy the house. I told him

we weren't selling.

WALKER

Right.

RACINE

That hasn't changed, has it?

WALKER

No, we're very happy with it.

RACINE

I can understand that.    It's a

terrific place.

WALKER

Are you going in?

I was just going to grab a bite.

I was a lawyer. Still am, I guess.

But I don't practice. Went to

Columbia. You?

RACINE

F. S. U.

WALKER

(nods)

Good school.  I got bored with it

quick. I guess I didn't have the

temperament.  I wanted to make the

money faster.  Is there a living in

it here?

RACINE

I can afford to send my shirts out.

And eat here once a month, if I don't

order an appetizer.

WALKER

I figured an honest lawyer doesn't

make much and the other kind was too

slimy for me. I'd rather be upfront

about shafting somebody.

MATTY

Edmund, really.     It's Mr. Racine's

profession.

RACINE

That's all right. I don't like it

much.

What is it, exactly?

WALKER

Various things.     This and that.

Here and there.

RACINE

You don't have to be specific.

WALKER

(that smile again)

Finance, basically. Venture capital,

Investments, real estate. We're

into a few things.

RACINE

Yeah?   Around here?

WALKER

Some.   We own some things here.

MATTY

Edmund's company owns The Breakers.

RACINE

Is that right?

WALKER

It's not that simple. We have an

interest in a few places along the

shore. For the land. You know.

Someday. There's no explaining it

A lovely lady.

Yes, she is. I'm crazy about her.

If I ever thought she was seeing

another guy... I don't know.

(he takes a sip of

wine)

I'd understand how it could happen.

Her being the way she is. I'd

understand it. But I think I'd kill

the guy with my bare hands.

RACINE

That's understanding.

WALKER

You wouldn't believe the dorkus she

was with when I met her. The guy

came to us with a business

proposition. We're always looking

for opportunities. If the conditions

are right. We're willing to take an

occasional risk, if the downside

isn't too steep. But this guy hadn't

done his homework, he didn't know

the bottom line. That's how I knew

he was full of shit. You've got to

know the bottom line. That's all

that really counts.

WALKER

He didn't have the goods,  this guy.

He was like a lot of guys  you run

into -- they want to get  rich, they

want to do it quick, they  want to be

there with one score.

No. I mean do what's necessary.

I couldn't call. I'm afraid to call.

I was afraid you wouldn't let me

come.

Yes, that's right. You can't call.

Never call. We have to be very

Why, Ned, why do you say this now?

RACINE

We could account for a couple calls.

We've had some contact. That would

make sense.

MATTY

Why, Ned?    What's happened?

RACINE

Because we're going to kill him.    We

both know that.

That's what you want, isn't it? We

RACINE

Sorry.

TEDDY

Hey, now I want to ask you something,

Are you listening, asshole, because

I like you?

(Racine nods)

I got a serious question for you.

What the fuck are you doing? This

is not shit for you to be messing

with. Are you ready to hear

something? See if this sounds

familiar. Anytime you try a decent

crime, there is fifty ways to fuck

up. If you think of twenty-five of

them you're a genius. And you're no

genius. You know who told me that?

TEDDY

Listen, man, maybe you should let me

do it for you. Gratis. I'll do it.

I wouldn't even be on the street if

it weren't for you.

RACINE

Thanks.

TEDDY

I hope you know what you're doin'

you better be pretty damn sure about

it. If you ain't sure, don't do it.

Of course, that's my recommendation

anyway -- don't do it.

Racine's shoulder)

Because I tell you, Counselor, this

arson, this is serious crime.

MATTY

I don't know why he's so crazy about

her. Maybe because he never had any

of his own. She's a cute little

girl, all right, but other than

that... I know this, though, her

mother has worked plenty hard to

keep Heather on Edmund's mind, Always

bringing her around, reporting

everything she does in school. That

Roz is a smart one. And you know

that anything Heather inherits goes

straight to Roz. Heather won't even

get a look at it. That's the part I

can't stand. That's why it seems so

wrong to have half of it go to her.

RACINE

That's the way it is.       There's nothing

we can do about it.

MATTY

Are you sure, Ned? I've been thinking

about it. Maybe there is. The will

is with his lawyer in Miami I know

that. What if I could get him to

bring it home? He did it once, he'd

do it again. If I could swing it,

couldn't we rewrite it? Change it.

Then when he dies, I could find the

new one. We could just change it a

little. Every little change would

mean a lot to us, End. You're a

lawyer. You know how to write it.

It wouldn't seem so odd. I could

say he brought it home and we talked

about it and decided to make some

changes up here. And I knew you

already --

No.   Forget it.

Listen to me, Matty. Nothing strange

can happen in his life right now,

not one thing out of the ordinary.

That's vital, that's the main thing.

If anything does, the chances double

that we get caught. You and I are

walking out there on the edge every

second now. One false move and we're

gonna fall off. It'll be all over.

You've got to remember that all the

time.

(he studies her

face)

You'll get half of everything and

it'll be plenty. No matter what it

is, we're gonna be satisfied. We're

not gonna get greedy. If we do,

we'll get burned. You gotta believe

me, baby, the odds that we'll get

burned are good enough without looking

for trouble.

BEVERLY

Ned.   Miles Hardin. Do you want

him?

RACINE

Who is he?

BEVERLY

She says he's a lawyer from Miami.

RACINE

Hello.

SECRETARY

(filtered)

Mr. Ned Racine?

RACINE

Yes.

SECRETARY

Miles Hardin calling.

HARDIN

(filtered throughout)

Mr. Racine.

RACINE

Yes.

HARDIN

This is Miles Hardin of Morris and

Dale in Miami.

RACINE

Yes.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                78.

HARDIN

As you know, we represented Edmund

Walker.

RACINE

Yes.

HARDIN

Yes, well, Mrs. Walker has submitted

the new will you wrote up there.

RACINE

Yes...    I see.

HARDIN

And frankly, Mr. Racine, I think we

may have a problem.

RACINE

Uh-huh.    What problem is that?

HARDIN

Well, I'd   rather discuss  it in person.

In fact I   think it might  be best if

we could   all get together  down there.

That is,   if you wouldn't  object.

RACINE

No no, that would be all right.

HARDIN

Good. We have a relationship with a

firm in West Palm -- Shiller,

Hastings.

RACINE

I know of them.

HARDIN

I've arranged to have the use of

their offices. I thought we might

try to make it tomorrow, say ten

o'clock. Would that be possible for

you?

RACINE

Yes, I think so.

HARDIN

Good. Mrs. Walker told me she would

be back down there by then.

HARDIN (CONT'D)

And I've asked Mrs. Kraft, Mr.

Walker's sister, to join us, also.

I'll see you then.

RACINE

Right.

HARDIN

Good-bye.

RACINE

(to Beverly)

Will you get me Mrs. Edmund Walker,

please.

BEVERLY

I don't have her. Should I?

RACINE

I thought the temporary put her in.

She came in while you were on

vacation. Look it up. They were in

Pinehaven, I think.

BEVERLY

(filtered)

I get no answer at the Pinehaven

number.

RACINE

Okay.    Try again later.

Miles Hardin, Mr. Racine.

RACINE

How are you?

HARDIN

I don't think you know Mrs. Kraft.

RACINE

(shakes her head)

No.   I don't. My condolences.

ROZ

Thank you.

RACINE

Mrs. Walker, I'm very sorry about

your husband.

MATTY

Thank you, Mr. Racine.

HARDIN

You know Mr. Lowenstein.

RACINE

Hello, Peter.

LOWENSTEIN

Hi, Ned.

HARDIN

I asked Mr. Lowenstein to join us

because he's handling the inquiry

into Edmund's death for the County

Prosecutor's office. He and I have

discussed this matter and he's made

is possible for us to speak very

frankly here today. Off the record,

so to speak.

HARDIN (CONT'D)

(to Racine)

As I've told Mrs. Walker, I was more

than a little surprised by the

existence of this new will. Edmund

hadn't mentioned anything about it

to me.

HARDIN

Mrs. Walker explained to me that

when she and her husband decided to

make some minor changes, they just

took care of it up here for

simplicity's sake. And, indeed, as

you know, the new will is almost

identical to the old but for the

disposition of a few items.

(to the group in

general)

At the risk of oversimplifying, the

thrust of the will is to divide the

estate in almost equal parts between

Heather Kraft and Mrs. Walker. Would

you agree with that assessment, Mr.

Racine?

HARDIN

Mmmm. And you witnessed the    signing

by Edmund Walker along with   this

Miss --

(glancing at papers

on the desk)

-- Mary Ann Simpson on July   twenty-

first. Apparently, it will    be

impossible for us to contact   Miss

Simpson.

MATTY

Mary Ann is a lifelong   friend of

mine. She  happened to   be visiting

on her way to Europe.    I'm sure when

she returns she'll get   in touch with

me.

RACINE

(eyeing Hardin)

Although it's certainly not required.

The witnesses to the signing of a

will are not commonly available when

the will is entered into probate.

It's not standard by any means.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               82.

HARDIN

Edmund Walker's death was not

standard.

ROZ

(to Hardin)

Pardon me. I'm sorry. I'm confused.

Is there some question about the

authenticity of the will?

RACINE

I'm confused, too. Do you have a

problem with the witnessing or the

signatures? What is it you're getting

at?

HARDIN

(almost wistful)

No, there doesn't seem to be any

problem here. This is Edmund Walker's

last will and testament. I'm afraid

the problem is elsewhere.

HARDIN

Would anyone mind if I smoked?

LOWENSTEIN

I don't need my own. I'll just

breathe the air.

WIPE TO:

HARDIN

Everything's in order up to there.

The problem comes in the language of

the bequest to Heather. It's a

technical matter.

(MORE)

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               83.

HARDIN (CONT'D)

In writing the will, I'm afraid Mr.

Racine violated what's known as "the

rule against perpetuities.

HARDIN

It's a small thing, but it's the

law. It forbids an inheritance to

be passed down indefinitely for

generations. Many general

practitioner lawyers don't fully

understand it. It doesn't come up

much for them, because wills this

complex are usually handled by estate

departments in larger firms. Handled

by lawyers who specialize in this

type of work.

HARDIN

I know this is terribly confusing,

but if you'll bear with me... I

spotted the problem right away, but

since Edmund's intent was clear, I

thought it in everyone's best interest

to try and get the will admitted

into probate anyway, even though it

was technically incorrect. I knew

that a probate judge in Miami would

spot the mistake right away. That's

all they do all day, they're expert.

So I thought I'd bring it up here to

Okeelanta County -- since Edmund had

the residence here -- and see if I

could get lucky with a judge who

didn't know estate law quite so

well...

(dryly, he can't

resist)

Perhaps find one with the same kind

of training as Mr. Racine.

HARDIN

Unfortunately, my plan backfired. I

ran into a judge who'd had other

dealings with Mr. Racine. A Judge

Costanza.

HARDIN (CONT'D)

In fact, it seems there were problems

with an estate in a case four years

ago. Very different problems, it's

true. But on a will Mr. Racine

prepared. It was quite a mess.

Accusations of carelessness, a

malpractice suit...

(to Racine)

I think he called it the Gourson

case?

ROZ

Once again, Mr. Hardin, you've lost

me.

MATTY

Yes, what does all this mean?

HARDIN

It means, I'm afraid, that Edmund's

will is invalid. Edmund Walker died

interstate, as though there were no

will at all.

MATTY

So... what happens now?

HARDIN

You don't know?

MATTY

(irritated)

No, I don't.

HARDIN

Perhaps Mr. Racine would like to

tell you.

RACINE

In the state of Florida, when a person

dies without a will, and there are

no children and no surviving parents,

then the spouse inherits everything.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  85.

MATTY

My god.   You mean... it's all mine?

HARDIN

Though that was clearly not your

husband's intention.

MATTY

My god.

HARDIN

He intended Heather to benefit --

MATTY

(looking between

Hardin and Roz)

Of course, of course, I understand.

Of course.

HARDIN

As you can imagine, Mrs. Walkers

given the circumstances of Edmund's

death, none of this is going to

happen... how should I say it...

simply.

MATTY

... Of course...

RACINE

You look good in black.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                86.

MATTY

I've missed you so badly.   I need

you.

RACINE

At first I couldn't figure out when

you got ahold of my stationery and

stuff. It finally came to me...

Edmund's signature must have been a

snap. And you knew I wasn't gonna

challenge mine --

MATTY

Please stop. I don't blame you for

hating me right now.

RACINE

You've really done it, Matty.    You

really have.

MATTY

Will you come to the house tonight?

MATTY

I want you more right now than I

ever have. I know how you must feel

about me. But please come tonight.

RACINE

I hope you haven't done us in.

RACINE

Hi, guys. Just come on in, make

yourself at home.

GRACE

Sorry about that.

LOWENSTEIN

Not me. The door was unlocked,

inviting illegal entry. It's behavior

like that makes Oscar's job so hard.

RACINE

Sorry, Oscar. Would you guys a beer?

LOWENSTEIN

No thanks, I already had one.

GRACE

I've gotta bring my wife up here.

She thinks our house is the hottest

place in the county.

RACINE

It ain't great this time of day.

GRACE

Ned, how did you get involved with

this Matty Walker?

RACINE

(takes a drink)

What do you mean?

GRACE

I mean she's poison, man. Tell me

what you know about her old man's

death.

RACINE

What read in the paper. He died in

the fire. Looks like arson--

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             88.

LOWENSTEIN

Was arson.

RACINE

Okay, was arson. You don't know if

he was setting it and messed up...

or if that's just what someone wanted

it to look like.

GRACE

Nah, he didn't set it.   Somebody

offend him.

RACINE

His people owned the place or

something?

GRACE

(nods)

That's right. A very rough group of

fellows, too. They're arguing with

the insurance company right now.

It's possible they wanted to cut old

Edmund out. I'm sure they're not

too broken up over his departure.

(grimaces)

But this just doesn't seem like a

neat way to handle something like

that.

LOWENSTEIN

It's not their style. They're very

smooth. They'd rather destroy you

than kill you. And they hate

publicity.

GRACE

Course guys like that make a lot of

enemies. Coulda been a grudge match

from the outside, I suppose.

(he looks at Racine)

But me, I'm kinda interested in the

grieving widow.

LOWENSTEIN

Her sister-in-law's got plenty of

ideas along that line, too. She

could barely contain herself today,

I could tell.

(he cackles)

But she wants to wait and see how

Matty treats her on the estate. She

doesn't want to blow it.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             89.

GRACE

How'd you get involved?

RACINE

(shrugs)

They asked me to re-do the will. I

met with her and Edmund. It was

pretty simple. This Mary Ann Simpson

witnessed it with me. Walker didn't

seem to think it was any big deal.

GRACE

That's it?

RACINE

That's it.

GRACE

What was this Simpson's story?

RACINE

I don't know... old friend of theirs,

good-looking broad. She was just

passing through.

GRACE

On her way to Europe?

GRACE

The passport people can't find any

record of that.

GRACE

What do you think? About the wife?

RACINE

I suppose it's possible. I don't

know much about her, except --

(he grins)

-- what I've seen. Wouldn't shock

me, either way.

LOWENSTEIN

I've got a feeling she's very bad

news. Take some incredibly

intelligent advice and stay away

from her.

GRACE

He's right for once.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                90.

RACINE

Well, I'm sorry, guys.    I'm afraid I

can't do that.

GRACE

Why not?

RACINE

First of all, did you get a look at

her?

RACINE

That wouldn't be quite so meaningful,

except that today she started coming

on to me. And maybe you haven't

heard but the lady is about to come

into a great deal of money.

RACINE

The fact   is, she's invited me out to

her place   tonight. And I'm going.

And I'll   keep on going as many nights,

or days,   or weekends, as she'll have

me.

LOWENSTEIN

Ned, that lady may have just killed

her husband.

RACINE

Peter, she's not gonna inherit

anything by killing me.

GRACE

Ned, you've messed up before. You'll

mess up again. That's your nature.

But they've always been small-time.

This might not be. She's trouble,

Ned. The real thing. Big-time, major

league trouble. Watch yourself.

MATTY

I know. I know. I know you'd

probably like to kill me. I know.

But please... you can hate me...

punish me... hurt me if you want,

but don't talk yet.

MATTY

Please, Ned.

MATTY

... Mary Ann and I left Wheaton

together and went to Chicago. We

didn't know what we were doing. I

got in bad trouble with drugs. Speed.

Really bad. I did things...

(she looks up at

him)

Whatever's the evilest thing you can

think of me now, I did worse things

then. There's nothing lower than

the animal I was then. Worse than

you can imagine. I thought I would

die. I prayed I would... And then

a man helped me. He got me clean.

He didn't want much in return,

either... He was a lawyer and he

put me to work in his office. I

learned a lot there. One time I

even thought I might go to law school.

... That's where I picked up the

business about making a will invalid.

That happened to him once. I swear

I would never have used that if I'd

known about your case... I was afraid

to tell you, Ned. I knew you wouldn't

let me do it. I'm greedy, like you

said. I wanted us to have it all.

MATTY

I don't blame you for thinking I'm

bad. I am. I know it. I'd

understand if you just cut me off

now. If you never trusted me again.

You'd probably be smart. But you

must believe one thing. I love you.

I love you and need you. I want to

be with you forever.

RACINE

They already think you're involved.

MATTY

I don't care.

RACINE

Great.

MATTY

There's nothing we can do about it

now. In a little while we'll either

have the money or we won't. It's

out of our hands.

MATTY

I fired the housekeeper. We can

stay together as long as we want.

We're all alone here now.

back in the future... if that's all

right, if it's still legal to go to

Miami.

LOWENSTEIN

He is mad.

RACINE

Nooo. No, I'm not mad. Why should

I be mad just because my friend here,

who I've know for years, wants to

know of my whereabouts on the night

of our recent local murder?

LOWENSTEIN

It's not so recent anymore.   Maybe

he's feeling some pressure.

GRACE

You brought this on yourself, man!

I don't run this department, you

know. There are people watching

this thing. They hear you're out

there banging the widow every night;

it tends to call attention to you.

So don't give me shit.

RACINE

That's my business!

GRACE

This whole damn case is getting crazy.

LOWENSTEIN

(to Grace)

Did you tell him about the glasses?

LOWENSTEIN

Seems Walker always ware glasses --

steel-rimmed glasses. He was a real

fanatic about them.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 94.

LOWENSTEIN

But there were none on the scene.

Coroner says they should've been

there. He says that even after the

fire the frames should've been seared

into his -- well, you don't want to

hear the details.

RACINE

So what?

GRACE

So it's looking more and more like

he was killed somewhere else and

brought there in his own car. Your

honey, his wife, says he left the

house in the middle of the night

driving himself to some mysterious

meeting. Is that vague enough for

you?

RACINE

Look, what is this? What do you

want? Am I supposed to be an

undercover agent for you guys, or

something?

LOWENSTEIN

Interesting choice of phrase.

RACINE

How 'bout tonight I ask her? 'Say,

did you kill your husband? My friends

were just wondering...'

LOWENSTEIN

Hey, that's an idea. Ask her where

the glasses are, where she did it...

Anything else I'm forgetting, Oscar?

OSCAR

Just one thing.

LOWENSTEIN

Oh, yeah! Right, right. You'll

love this, Ned, this latest

development. Maybe you'll be able

to work up a little sympathy for us,

see why Oscar here has a tendency to

get carried away. Tell him, Oscar.

This is rich.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               95.

OSCAR

This is from the sister-in-law, the

Kraft woman. She's been driving me

batty lately. She's convinced she

ain't gonna be out into the will.

It seems that a couple weeks before

the murder, Walker's niece stayed up

there for a while with your friend

Matty. One night she waxes up, goes

to see her aunt and catches the lady

with some guy.

LOWENSTEIN

Do you get it?    In the act or some

fucking thing!

GRACE

We haven't got all the details yet.

Mrs. Kraft is bringing the little

girl up here today to tell us her

story.

LOWENSTEIN

(to Grace)

Oh, they're here. I ran into them

on the way in. They're waiting

outside.

GRACE

Christ. I'm not sure I'm up to

dealing with this scene.

GRACE

(to Racine)

Listen, you probably don't want to

see the Kraft woman right now. She's

a little wild. Why don't you slip

out the back way here?

Are we done here?

LOWENSTEIN

Little Heather comes out onto the

back porch, and this dude is out

there with her aunt, see? And he's

turned away with his pants or shorts

Can you imagine poor Heather? She

gander at that. And listen to why

she got up in the first place, this

up that night. Think about it, think

So where could they have gone?

RACINE

That's crazy. You imagined it. I

know, I've been imagining things,

too. Plenty.

MATTY

No, Ned, not with her I wasn't. I

could tell there was a difference.

Maybe she know about us. Maybe she

wants something.

RACINE

Don't you think we would have heard

from her by now?

MATTY

I don't know what to think. I'm

worried. But it's not about the

glasses. Or your friends. It's us.

Your first reaction is to accuse me.

What's happening to you? I don't

know if we can hold on like this.

Hardin called today. He said

everything should be cleared up by

LOWENSTEIN

Buddy, your lawyer is present.

LOWENSTEIN

You know, that Edmund Walker was a

Mmm. I have my own standards. I try

As far as I'm concerned, I don't

His whole life is based on doing the

need help.

LOWENSTEIN

Someone's putting you in deep trouble,

my friend. From about three thirty

to five AM on the night Walker was

killed, someone called your hotel

room repeatedly. The hotel didn't

want to put them through, but whoever

was calling convinced them it was an

emergency. The phone rang and rang,

but you didn't answer.

LOWENSTEIN

Don't say anything. Save it for some

Other time. It gets worse.

(he stamps out his

butt)

Now someone's trying to give us

Edmund's glasses. We don't know who.

We don't know what the glasses will

tell us. But our negotiations are

continuing.

LOWENSTEIN

I wish I knew what to tell you, Ned.

But I don't have any good ideas.

LOWENSTEIN

I'll see ya.

GLENN

Christ, I've done it again.

(embarrassed,

indicates the

entrance)

I'm just meeting some people.

GLENN

Hey, this is silly. You're not still

mad about that Gourson business?

(Racine shrugs,

takes a drink)

We had to do it. Costanza practically

insisted we sue you. Listen, nobody

at our place likes malpractice against

other lawyers.

RACINE

Forget it.

GLENN

I tried to make it up to you.

GLENN

Did you ever meet a lady named Matty

Walker? You'd remember her. A very

hot number.

RACINE

Matty Walker?

GLENN

(glances at the

entrance)

Yeah. I met her at a party. She said

she was going up there and she wanted

to know about lawyers. I gave her

your name.

RACINE

When was this?

GLENN

(trying to remember)

I don't know... long time. Maybe

September.

Oops, gotta go.

RACINE

Did you tell her about the Gourson

case?

GLENN

(a slimy grin)

Hey, I was trying to get you work.

RACINE

Did you tell her about Gourson?

GLENN

Jesus, are you nuts?

GLENN

Maybe I told her how we met. Yeah,

maybe.

BEVERLY

Teddy Laursen is in County. He's

very anxious to talk to you. He

sounded bad.

BEVERLY

Hey, are you all right?

TEDDY

I don't know. It's a thing in

Lauderdale. Something must've gone

wrong, but they're not telling me.

I'm a little worried.

RACINE

I'll find out.

TEDDY

No, no. That's not why I called you.

In fact, I got me another lawyer.

TEDDY

I think it would be better. You know

Schlisgal.

RACINE

(nods, confused)

He's good.

TEDDY

This broad came to me last week. A

real looker. She said you told her

how to reach me, I figured you musta,

she knew all about it.

(Racine nods)

She said you wanted another one.

TEDDY

Yeah, I was afraid of that. But I'm

a slow thinker.

She had me show her how to rig it to

any of this mean anything to you?

TEDDY

Then I'm glad I told you. Watch your

step.

RACINE

Thanks, Teddy.

TEDDY

Racine... Don't thank me yet. These

guys here, they've been asking me

about The Breakers.

(reads Racine's

look)

I haven't told 'em shit. But I don't

like the look on their faces.

BEVERLY

(yells)

Ned. It's Mrs. Walker. Do you want

her?

RACINE

Yeah.

(he picks up)

Hello.

MATTY

(filtered throughout)

Hello, Ned. Can we talk?

RACINE

Okay. Where are you?

MATTY

I'm in Miami. I've been running around

like crazy and I could reach you

before I left.

(a pause)

Ned, everything's going to be all

right.

RACINE

Tell me.

MATTY

I've got the money. I've taken it

and sent it somewhere safe. It's all

ours now.

(Racine says nothing)

But that's not the best part.

RACINE

What's the best part?

MATTY

The glasses. I got them back. That

is, they should be ours by now.

Betty had them. She wanted money.

That's why I had to come down here.

She made it all very difficult, but

I think it worked out.

RACINE

Do you have them?

MATTY

No. She wouldn't do that. She's

putting them in the boathouse. In

the top drawer of the dresser in the

boathouse. They should be there

now, if she's kept up her end.

RACINE

Yes.

MATTY

I think you'd better get them right

away. I don't trust her.

RACINE

In the boathouse.

MATTY

That's right. The top drawer of the

dresser. Oh. Ned, we're going to be

all right. I'll leave here as soon

Are you all right?

Yes.

MATTY

Good-bye, sweetheart.

GRACE

Teddy, this is Detective Knapp from

the Fort Lauderdale Arson Squad.

He's brought some very bad news about

that fire. Seems there were two people

who didn't get out.

GRACE

I know, Teddy. It's not like     you.

And I'm willing to make that     clear

to anybody who'll listen. But     you're

going to have to help me out     on this

Breakers business.

It's all ours now, Ned. We could

Yes, it is.

MATTY

(voice changed)

What's this --?

RACINE

It's Edmund's gun. You remember it,

don't you?

MATTY

What is it, Ned? What's happened?

RACINE

I think you know.

MATTY

No.   I swear to you, I don't!

RACINE

It's the glasses, Matty.

MATTY

Weren't they there? Didn't she bring

them?

RACINE

I didn't see them.

MATTY

She promised she'd bring them.

RACINE

Maybe I missed them. The way you

missed them that night.

MATTY

Ned, I don't know what you think,

but you're wrong. I haven't done

anything to hurt you. I love you.

You've got to believe me.

Keep talking, Matty. Experience shows

I can be convinced of anything.

that...

RACINE

You never quit, do you? You just

keep on coming.

MATTY

How can I prove it to you? What can

I say?

RACINE

The glasses, Matty. Why don't you go

down there and get them?

MATTY

But you said they weren't there.

RACINE

I said I didn't see them.

RACINE

She's alive.

RACINE

But what if that was someone else's

body in there? What if it was already

there when I got there -- dead and

waiting for me. Maybe her friend...

Mary Ann.

GRACE

Her teeth were left, man. We sent

them back to Illinois. The

identification was positive. That

was her, that was Matty Tyler Walker.

That was her and she's dead.

RACINE

You're not listening to me. What if

she's been using this other girl's

name? Since she met Walker three

years ago, since she first spotted

him and decided to take him... one

way or another. Maybe Walker -- or

any of us -- never knew her real

name.

GRACE

Why would she want to hide her

identity?

RACINE

I don't know. Maybe there was

something in her past, something so

bad she was afraid it would queer it

with Walker if he found out -- that

he'd never marry her.

RACINE

Let's say she's living as the other

girl, this girl from her past. Someone

whose history she knew and could use

any way she wanted. And there's only

one person in the world who knows

the truth.

(he leans in)

And then just when Matty's got me on

the line, when she's finally going

to collect, that one person shows

up. That girl. Finds her. And

threatens to expose her. So Matty

starts paying her off. Maybe she

even promises to cut her in on

Edmunds' money. Now she's got to

share it with two people.

RACINE

But when Matty sees a way to get rid

of both of them at once. A way to

solve all her problems and get clear,

with no one looking for her. At the

boathouse. You find two bodies, me

and this girl. Two killers dead.

Case closed.

RACINE

You can't find the money, can you,

Oscar? Doesn't that tell you

something?

GRACE

It tells    me she moved it and we can't

find it.    And that don't mean shit.

It could    be sittin' in any bank in

the world    waiting for a dead lady to

come for    it.

GRACE

Do you hear what you're saying? It's

crazy. This Matty would've had to

been one quick, smart broad.

RACINE

Oscar, don't you understand? That

was her special gift she was

relentless.

(much quieter)

Matty was the kind of person who

could do what was necessary. Whatever

was necessary.
