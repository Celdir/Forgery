TINA

The N.T.S.B. guys are here.

CRAWFORD

(Doesn't look up)

Yep.

3

CRAWFORD

It's here.

ROB

What about dinner tonight?

JENNIFER

We go out to dinner - we might never

come back.

ROB

Okay.

(Beat)

I want to wake up with you.    I want

to...

ROB

...at least see where you live.

4

JENNIFER

I live...here.

OPERATOR (ON PHONE)

L.A.P.D.

CRAWFORD

Lieutenant Nunally, please.

OPERATOR (ON PHONE)

He doesn't come on til six. You want

his voice mail?

CRAWFORD

No.  Thank you.

(beat)

I'll see him later.

5

JENNIFER

You're - home early.

6

CRAWFORD

I just felt a sudden urge.

JENNIFER

Are you...okay?

CRAWFORD

I could use a hug.

JENNIFER

Have you been drinking?

CRAWFORD

I've been watching you sleep.   At

night.

JENNIFER

(Gently)

That's creepy.

CRAWFORD

Sometimes when I'm at work, I'll start

thinking about you and I'll just get -

just - overwhelmed.

JENNIFER

Tommy -

CRAWFORD

It's a dense, crushing -

geophysical force. Like I'm

pinned. At the core - where things

change.

(beat)

You ever get that way about me,

Jen?

JENNIFER

What are you talking about?

CRAWFORD

I'm trying to describe my feelings.

JENNIFER

Those don't sound like feelings.

7

CRAWFORD

No?

(Beat)

What's the sound of one feeling...in a

forest?

JENNIFER

You think you're so much smarter

than I am. That must make you feel

very powerful.

CRAWFORD

Helpless, actually.

JENNIFER

Okay.     Maybe it's time to really talk.

CRAWFORD

No.

JENNIFER

No?

JENNIFER

Fine. Whatever. I'll make you some

dinner.

CRAWFORD

I know.     Everything.

JENNIFER

I'm so sorry.

CRAWFORD

Don't be. Knowledge is pain.         I'm

used to that.

CRAWFORD

It's not like I don't let little

pleasures, in return for the pain.

8

GIFFORD

Tom?   Jen?   Everything okay in there?

CRAWFORD

Everybody just LEAVE US ALONE!

9

SWAT COMMANDER

You the Negotiator?

NUNALLY

Yeah.    What do we know?

CRAWFORD

Yes?

INTERCUT WITH:

NUNALLY

Mr. Crawford?

CRAWFORD

Who is this?

NUNALLY

My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally.

I'm a hostage negotiator for the Los -

10

NUNALLY

Mr. Crawford?

NUNALLY

Okay then.   Here we go.

NUNALLY (O.S.)

Mr. Crawford?

NUNALLY

Hey.

CRAWFORD

Get rid of the vampires.

CRAWFORD

Do I call you Rob?

NUNALLY

If you want.

11

CRAWFORD

Not vampires.

NUNALLY

What?

CRAWFORD

Not vampires.     Ghouls.   Sorry.

NUNALLY

Mr. Crawford, what do you say you give

me the gun - so I can pay more

attention to what you're saying?

CRAWFORD

Is that your best shot?

(Beat)

So to speak.

NUNALLY

I just think - maybe it would -

CRAWFORD

Tell you what: I will if you will.

CRAWFORD

We both put down our guns.      At the

same time.

CRAWFORD

We set them down and step away.

(Beat)

Then you can "pay more attention" to

what I'm saying.

12

CRAWFORD

Happy ending, then.

NUNALLY

Mr. Crawford, your neighbor mentioned

that your wife -

CRAWFORD

It's Tom.

NUNALLY

I'm sorry?

CRAWFORD

You can call me Tom.

NUNALLY

Tom.   Your wife. Is she here?

CRAWFORD

Yes.

NUNALLY

Is she all right?

CRAWFORD

I don't think she is.     I shot her,

Rob.

NUNALLY

You shot your wife.

13

CRAWFORD

It was like I just suddenly - snapped.

We were arguing - and I got the gun.

NUNALLY

- okay - I hear you -

CRAWFORD

And I shot her in the head.   I know it

was wrong.

(Beat)

Are you listening to me?

NUNALLY

Oh Jesus Christ.

NUNALLY

(into walkie-talkie)

We need a medic in here! Get the

ambulance up! RIGHT NOW! NOW! NOW!

NUNALLY

Oh no - God no - I can't - get a -

CRAWFORD

You know, I think I read somewhere

that a good place to find a pulse is

the femoral artery. It's on the inner

surface of the upper thigh. If you

put your fingers - you know, right up

inside her dress -

14

PARAMEDIC

Wait a second - she's not dead!

SWAT COMMANDER

You all right?

15

NUNALLY

Yeah.     I'm good.

FADE OUT

- hereby give notice that I will be resigning my

position at the District Attorney's Office as of

Novemb-

16

WILLY

Mrs. Demello?

(Beat)

MRS. DEMELLO!    Your CAR!

WILLY (V.O.)

Come on, Phil: I called you as a

courtesy, and you start looking to

take advantage?

WILLY

I'm not knocking it down to a Class C.

My backlog of open cases does not

mitigate the fact that your client

tried to kill his brother-in-law with -

oh, right, a "golfing accident"? Your

client owns one golf club and no golf

(MORE)

17

WILLY (cont'd)

balls - and the "accident" took place

in the stairway of an illegal after-

hours gambling club. Yeah, okay -

I'll see you in court.

WILLY

Well, I won't see you in court, but

someone from this office will. You

take it up with them, I gotta go.

(switching phones)

Willy Slocum. Oh - hey, hi, yes.

NORMAN

Wooton Sims?!

WILLY

No, I didn't.     Wow.   Okay.

WILLY

No - short notice is...fine. No, I

can. Black tie. Sure. What time?

Okay. Yes. Thank her.

NORMAN

Wooton - SIMS?!

Wooton Sims?!

WILLY

Please stop saying, "Wooton Sims" over

and over. It's starting to sound like

nonsense words.

NORMAN

You asshole!

WILLY

Okay: go back to "Wooton Sims."

NORMAN

How the hell did you get a job at

Wooton Sims?! I can't even get an

interview!

18

NORMAN

I've been here five years. I'm your

supervisor. I graduated USC, summa!

WILLY

We're just going to pretend he's not

talking, okay?

MONA                            NORMAN

No problem.                     I'm serious.

WILLY

I'm really jammed-up all day, and I

need to rent a tuxedo - for tonight.

NORMAN

A tuxedo?! Oh, come on!     You are so

full of shit.

WILLY

(Jotting notes)

There must be a place that does that,

right - same day? I'm also gonna need

a messenger to bring it here. This is

my suit size and my shirt size...I

really appreciate this.

MONA

What's going on?

WILLY

Wooton Sims buys a whole lot of seats

to this charity opera thing every

year, because Bob Wooton is the

chairman of this committee -

NORMAN

"Bob" Wooton?!

WILLY

(Enjoying, mock-helpless)

It's what the man told me to call him.

19

GLADYS

You're gonna need to pick out a style,

Willy.

WILLY

A style.

GLADYS

For the tuxedo.

WILLY

I don't know - I just don't want to

look like I'm going to the prom.

GLADYS

You wanna go Classic.    Fix him up.

MONA

We'll get you something Classic.

(Picks up a ringing phone)

Willy Slocum's office.

NORMAN

Make sure it comes with cuff-links and

knee-pads.

WILLY

Oh, that's very nice: it's good to be

back in high school.

MONA

(Hanging up)

Willy?

MONA

God wants to see you.

WILLY

(Beat)

Our God?

MONA

Who art on the Eleventh Floor.

20

NORMAN

There is no justice! There is no

justice in the city of Los Angeles!

LOBRUTO

William No-Middle-Initial Slocum.

WILLY

Yes sir.

LOBRUTO

Sit.

(As Willy does:)

Eighty-four-percent conviction rate.

That's remarkable.

WILLY

Thank you.

LOBRUTO

With a case load thirty percent higher

than any other first-year DDA.

(Beat)

Of course - you also swapped more

cases than the rest of them put

together.

WILLY

I offered my losing cases in exchange

for two or three of anyone else's

possible convictions. They couldn't

handle their workloads, and I prefer

not to lose.

LOBRUTO

You're going to need a middle initial.

21

WILLY

Sir?

LOBRUTO

You're going to Wooton Sims.

WILLY

In two weeks.

LOBRUTO

You'll be able to afford a better

suit. But those guys all play squash

and have middle names. They go in for

the mother's maiden name a lot.

WILLY

My mother didn't have a maiden name.

LOBRUTO

So you're a bastard; sometimes I can

be a son-of-a-bitch. Maybe you belong

here.

WILLY

I didn't work this hard to stay where

I belong.

LOBRUTO

You're a street-fighter, Willy. You

should be in court. We can move you

up to better cases.

WILLY

I appreciate the offer.

LOBRUTO

I didn't think so.

(Closes the file, stands)

Well - you got your litigation

experience. Your chops. And your

juicy private sector job. Anything

else the City of Los Angeles can do

for you?

22

WILLY

No, I think that's everything - thank

you.

LOBRUTO

The offer stands. If you get tired of

carrying a spear.

LOBRUTO

It's an opera joke. Give my regards

to Bob.

WILLY

Willy Slocum.

INTERCUT WITH:

NORMAN

I've got an Attempted Homicide.

Conley caught it last night, but he's

hung up in motions with Gardner.

Arraignment in Part Seven, at three

o'clock.

WILLY

Three o'clock is in fifteen minutes.

NORMAN

Thank you.   What's the temperature?

23

WILLY

I can't do it.

NORMAN

You do still actually work here,

Willy, right? I mean, you're still

going to be cashing your paycheck for

another two weeks and everything?

WILLY

Just get somebody else for this one.

NORMAN

Everybody's booked up. Look: it's not

going to trial. There's a weapon with

prints, and a confession. Take the

arraignment and wait for the plea.

WILLY

(Beat)

A real confession?

NORMAN

Spontaneous and signed.   Come on,

Willy.

WILLY

Okay.   Here's the problem.

NORMAN

You know - I really wish I was going

to see this.

24

JUDGE FELDMAN

Mr. Slocum. Nice to see a man who

dresses for court.

WILLY

Sorry, your honor.    Long story.

JUDGE FELDMAN

Grapevine has it the punch-line is

Wooton Sims.

WILLY

Yes, ma'am.

JUDGE FELDMAN

Good for you, double-oh-seven.

(Signaling the Bailiff)

Let's see what public service is

offering you by way of a send-off:

BAILIFF

The State of California Versus Thomas

Crawford.

JUDGE

Mr. Crawford, you've been charged with

section 664 slash 187 of the

California Penal Code: Attempted

Murder, with additional allegations of

Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal

Code section 245 dash A2, with Great

Bodily Injury, P.C. Section 12022.07.

(Beat)

Do you waive further reading of the

complaint and complete statement of

rights?

25

P.D.                              CRAWFORD

(sotto)                    I do.     But, your honor -

You do.

JUDGE FELDMAN

And do you wish to enter a plea at

this time?

CRAWFORD

Not guilty. But I also want to waive

my right to counsel, and represent

myself.

JUDGE FELDMAN

Do you have a problem with your

appointed counsel, Mr. Crawford?

CRAWFORD

No. I just want to do it myself.     I

believe it's within my rights.

P.D.

Your honor, if I could have a moment

with my client -

CRAWFORD

I'm not your client. Try and keep up,

would you?

JUDGE FELDMAN

Do the People have an objection or a

comment for the record, Mr. Slocum?

WILLY

I'm sorry, your honor: we've got the

weapon and a signed confession. I

really think Mr. Crawford needs a

competent attorney to - frankly -

negotiate a plea.

26

WILLY

I - can't - this was supposed to be -

with a pro se defendant, this is going

to drag out for months - and I'm not

even going to be here. The People

request a continuance to -

CRAWFORD

Excuse me? Your honor? I'm willing

to waive my right to a preliminary

hearing and go directly to a jury

trial.

(To Willy)

Does that help?

JUDGE

You don't need to look out for Mr.

Slocum, Mr. Crawford. The District

Attorney's office can shift another

prosecutor to the case -

CRAWFORD

No, I like Mr. Slocum.

JUDGE FELDMAN

Mr. Slocum?   He likes you.

WILLY

Terrific.

JUDGE FELDMAN

Mr. Crawford seems to understand his

rights and responsibilities.

WILLY

All due respect, your honor, I'm

worried this may turn into some sort

of a - circus -

JUDGE FELDMAN

I appreciate your concern for the

dignity of my courtroom, Mr. Slocum -

considering you're making the argument

dressed as a game-show host.

Unfortunately, the man is a tax-paying

citizen, entitled by our Constitution

to try and manipulate the legal

system, like everybody else.

(turning)

(MORE)

27

JUDGE FELDMAN (cont'd)

As for you, Mr. Crawford, I strongly

urge you to retain counsel. Lack of

same will not be grounds for appeal.

CRAWFORD

I understand.     Thank you.

JUDGE FELDMAN

Are the People ready to go to trial

without a preliminary hearing?

WILLY

Sure.   Why not.

NUNALLY

You're supposed to be good.

WILLY

Is that what I'm supposed to be?

NUNALLY

I asked around. You're supposed to be

top-notch - but to me it looks like

you've got one foot out the door, and

you're wiping the rest of us off the

bottom of the other one.

WILLY

I'm sorry to...disappoint you.

NUNALLY

I took Crawford's confession.

WILLY

And now you want mine?

28

NUNALLY

I'm here to warn you. Take this

seriously, because it's serious. This

guy is stone cold - and his wife - is

lying in a hospital bed - with brain

damage...

WILLY

Are you all right?

NUNALLY

Are you gonna be on this, or what?

WILLY

Yeah.  I'm on it.

(Gently)

You got a confession. You took the

gun out of his hand. It's done.

NUNALLY

I'm just - telling you. Is that okay?

Or are you too friggin' busy?!

WILLY

No.   It's okay.

NUNALLY

Forget it.

(Beat)

It's a lock. We're good.   Put him

down. Bury him.

NIKKI

Are you a shark?

29

WILLY

Sorry?

NIKKI

You've been circling the lobby for

half-an-hour now, like if you stopped

you'd die.

WILLY

If I stopped, I'd be standing around

with no one to talk to. At which

point, death would be a relief.

NIKKI

Why don't you talk to Bob?

WILLY

"Bob" is talking to the Governor.

(Beat)

Do I know you?

NIKKI

Nikki Gardner. Senior Associate,

Wooton Sims.

WILLY

(Shakes)

Oh - hey, hi. It was your office that

called, with the invitation.

NIKKI

On Bob's orders.

WILLY

Listen, I don't...actually know "Bob."

I mean, I've only met the man once.

NIKKI

Interesting.

NIKKI

You like opera?

30

WILLY

Truth is, I haven't really had that

much expos-

NIKKI

Neither do I.

NIKKI

Bob assigned you to my team. I'll

supervise your case-work, steer you

through the office arcana, and

generally keep an eye on you.

WILLY

Kind of like a mentor.

NIKKI

Kind of like a probation officer.

WILLY

Okay.

NIKKI

Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty

and a hundred-and-ten-percent

performance. But: you get to work on

legendary litigation. National,

sometimes global, in scope. It's high-

stakes. And cut-throat - even within

the team. We burn out associates at

an astonishing rate.

WILLY

You're trying to scare me.

NIKKI

Yes.

WILLY

You're going to have to try harder.

31

NIKKI

Can I ask you something personal?

WILLY

Sure.

NIKKI

Who are you?

NIKKI

We have a guy in our criminal

division, fresh out of Yale, named

Calvin Tyler. One of our very rich

clients gets pulled over, D.U.I. -

which is routine bullshit, so Calvin

gets it. Against you. Next thing we

know, Calvin is fired, and Bob Wooton,

who has never even interviewed a

junior associate before - let alone

hired one - says you're on my team.

WILLY

It was a good bust, so Calvin came to

me for a deal. I told him if he could

arrange an interview for me with Mr.

Wooton, I would throw the case. I

laid out his arguments and evidence

for him - and I showed him how I would

lose. Calvin set up my appointment

for the day after our court date.

Then he did what I had suggested in

court - and I wiped the floor with

him. Your client got the maximum.

Next day, I met with Mr. Wooton.

(Shrugs)

Bob.

NIKKI

Wow. You know what's brilliant about

that?

WILLY

Yes.

32

NIKKI

You didn't actually do anything all

that wrong.

WILLY

Well - I wasn't entirely honest with

Calvin.

NIKKI

You gonna get that?

WILLY

Everyone I need to talk to is here.

NIKKI

We need to talk about your transition

timetable.

WILLY

All right.

NIKKI

Bob believes in trial-by-fire. He

wants you up-to-speed two weeks from

Tuesday, because we're getting on a

plane to Chicago for depositions in a

class-action against our biggest

client, Armstead Pharmaceutical.

WILLY

No problem.

NIKKI

That's catch-up on three years' work -

and you haven't closed out your old

job yet.

WILLY

I'm good at trials.    Even by fire.

NIKKI

You know, a little bit of fear can be

a very healthy thing to have.

33

WILLY

I'm looking forward to when I can

afford the luxury of having some.

NIKKI

I'll have them put the Armstead

materials in your new office.

WILLY

Thanks.    Boss.

INTERCUT WITH:

MARCHAND

Marchand.

WILLY

It's Willy Slocum.     What's up?

MARCHAND

Your gun in that Palisades shooting is

no good.

WILLY

How can the gun be "no good"?

MARCHAND

It's a perfectly good weapon. A

Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter. It's

just no good as evidence. It's never

been fired.

WILLY

It's the gun from the scene?

34

MARCHAND

Yep. Bought by Mr. Thomas Crawford

and registered to his wife, about a

month ago. Apparently a gift.

WILLY

And between the shooting and arrest,

this guy was locked inside his house.

MARCHAND

Is that a question?

WILLY

No, I mean, just: what's the point?

Playing games with the gun. He's

alone in the house with the victim,

and he confessed - it's not like the

gun's gonna get him off the hook.

MARCHAND

Do you have a question I can answer?

WILLY

Look, our weapon is in that house

somewhere. Get a team out to search

it tomorrow morning.

MARCHAND

Ya think?

WILLY

(Sighs, smiles)

Thank you.

MESSENGER (O.S.)

Slocum?

35

WILLY

Yeah.

MESSENGER

Where do you want it?

WILLY

The idea here is we're trying to take

boxes out - not bring more in.

MESSENGER

Is that the idea?

WILLY

Whoa - wait a second, this is a screw-

up. I already have these documents.

I sent this box: to the Defendant, at

County.

MESSENGER

I picked up at County.    Slip says

bring 'em here.

INTERCUT WITH:

MARCHAND

Marchand.

36

WILLY

Where are we on this gun?

MARCHAND

We can't find it, Willy.

WILLY

I'm in trial on Monday.

MARCHAND

I know. I don't know what to tell

you. I'm there now.

WILLY

You said you'd get a team out a week

ago -

MARCHAND

I'm here now. My team has been here

twice already.

(Beat)

Do you really need it?

WILLY

Do I need it?! The weapon?!

WILLY

I don't know. Probably not.

Defendant's a whack-job.

MARCHAND

He went pro se, right?

WILLY

Yeah. Just when you think they're not

really stupid, they defend themselves.

MARCHAND

You've got a confession and an

airtight bunch of circumstantial.

(Apologetic)

We've gone over this place top-to-

bottom three times now, Willy.

WILLY

Yeah, okay. Don't worry about it.

(Beat)

Sorry - got a lot going on.

37

MARCHAND

Must be rough, figuring out what

you're gonna do with all that money.

WILLY

Hey, I had to sit through an opera

last week.

MARCHAND

Oh gee - lemme see if I can express

how much sympathy I have:

CRAWFORD

How's my wife?

WILLY

I don't know.

CRAWFORD

I heard somewhere, I think it was on

N.P.R., that you're supposed to talk

to people in a coma. Play their

favorite music. Supposedly it reaches

them.

CRAWFORD

You represent Jennifer. The voice of

the victim, judicially speaking. But

you haven't gone to see her?

38

WILLY

Not yet.

CRAWFORD

Too busy getting up to speed on

Armstead Pharmaceutical?

WILLY

I beg your pardon?

CRAWFORD

I'm not judging you. I think anyone -

coming from...what you came from -

then paying your way through East-Okie

Cowshit College and Tulsa Law by

writing papers for Princeton kids on

the internet - my God, it must have

eaten your liver! Sixty-thousand

dollars in debt, eighty-four percent

conviction rate: you deserve this.

WILLY

What the hell have you been doing.

CRAWFORD

I'm permitted the use of a private

investigator.

WILLY

Not to investigate me!

CRAWFORD

Why not?   You're investigating me.

WILLY

You shot your wife.

CRAWFORD

Allegedly. That's how it works,

right? If I can't introduce something

in court as evidence - it doesn't

exist. Legally.

WILLY

Look - I don't want to play games with

you.

CRAWFORD

I'm afraid you have to.

39

WILLY

Is this some form of - communication?

CRAWFORD

You sent me a box of papers.

WILLY

It's called Discovery.       The State has

a legal obliga-

CRAWFORD

There's nothing in it, Willy. You

haven't 'discovered' anything. Have

you found the gun?

WILLY

Not yet.

CRAWFORD

No.

(Beat)

Does it bother you that I call you

Willy?

WILLY

(Lies)

No.

CRAWFORD

I'd like you to consider becoming my

lawyer. I'll pay you. A lot of

money.

WILLY

I'm - prosecuting you.

CRAWFORD

Yeah, but I'm offering you a chance to

get on the right side of this whole

mess while you still can.

WILLY

Are you out of your mind?

40

CRAWFORD

I think - on advice of counsel - I'll

decline to answer that one.

WILLY

I don't need the gun to convict you,

by the way.

CRAWFORD

She was cheating, you know.

WILLY

It doesn't matter what she did...Tom.

What you did is a crime.

CRAWFORD

Perhaps. But - maybe my so-called

peers will look at me and see

themselves. Betrayed. Frustrated.

Humiliated. And you and I both know,

Willy, that people have an infinite

capacity for believing in their own

innocence.

WILLY

Great.   Take the stand. Tell your

story.   I'd appreciate it.

CRAWFORD

Not to mention the fact you have no

actual evidence connecting me to the

crime.

WILLY

Except your confession.

CRAWFORD

My grandfather was an egg farmer.

41

WILLY

Is this gonna be about how you had a

rough childhood?

CRAWFORD

I used to candle eggs at his farm.

You know what that is? You hold an

egg up to a light, and look for

imperfections.

(beat)

The first time I did it, he told me to

put the ones that were cracked or

flawed in a bucket - for the bakery.

(beat)

He came back an hour later and there

were three hundred eggs in the bakery

bucket. He asked me what the hell I

was doing.

(beat)

I found a flaw in every single one.

Thin places in the shell, minuscule

cracks.

(smiles)

Look closely enough and you'll find

everything has a weak spot...where it

can break.

WILLY

Looking for mine?

CRAWFORD

No, I've found yours.

WILLY

Illuminate me.

CRAWFORD

You're a winner, Willy.

WILLY

Huh. Well.      Joke's on me then, I

guess.

CRAWFORD

Yes.   It is.

WILLY

I'll see you in court, Mr. Crawford.

42

NIKKI

Make sure you sign the one with the

devil in blood. It's not binding

otherwise.

WILLY

Just want to be ready for Chicago.

I'm all closed-out, downtown. Last

trial starts Monday.

NIKKI

You've got a trial Monday?

WILLY

Yeah: attempted murder.

NIKKI

That gives you three days. You told

me - and I told Bob - that you would

be ready to hit the ground r-

WILLY

The man confessed.    And he's pro se.

NIKKI

Willy, some but acting as his own

lawyer - he could drag it out for

months!

WILLY

You want to hear his witness list?

43

NIKKI

No witnesses?

WILLY

It's kind of clever: this guy is

trying to provoke the system into

declaring him insane. I think he

thinks we'll call in the doctors and

he can fake 'em out by refusing the

defense. He's acting out this really -

organized plan to appear crazy.

NIKKI

You're gonna miss being in court,

aren't you?

WILLY

I'm almost halfway through these. And

I think I've already found about six

disqualifiers in Delaware, Ohio, and

Florida. I have to check case law in

each state, but it looks good. I'll

get the rest done over the long

weekend.

NIKKI

You don't go home for Thanksgiving?

WILLY

No.

NIKKI

If you want - you're welcome at mine.

My family's.

44

WILLY

Really?

NIKKI

I think it would be interesting.

WILLY

Yeah.    Okay, thank you.

NIKKI

Cool.

UNIFORM COP

We established a perimeter around the

house and then waited for SWAT and the

Negotiator. It was strictly by the

book.

WILLY

So the house was completely surrounded

within how long of the first shots?

UNIFORM COP

Maybe ten minutes.

WILLY

And when you arrived at the sc-

CRAWFORD

Sorry.

45

WILLY

When you arrived on the scene, was

there a crowd?

UNIFORM COP

Oh yeah. Neighbors, came out to look

soon as it started.

WILLY

And from what you could ascertain, no

one went into or came out of the house

until SWAT and the negotiator arrived?

UNIFORM COP

Definitely not.

WILLY

Thank you.   No further questions.

JUDGE ROBINSON

Mr. Crawford?

CRAWFORD

What?

JUDGE ROBINSON

Your witness, Mr. Crawford.

CRAWFORD

No questions for this witness.

DISSOLVE TO:

46

DR. KANG

- through the frontal cortex and the

temporal lobe, coming to rest against

the back of the skull.

WILLY

So this bullet inflicted serious

injury?

DR. KANG

It inflicted serious and irreparable

injury.

WILLY

Dr. Kang, is it safe to say that

someone inflicting this kind of wound

intended to kill?

JUDGE ROBINSON

Mr. Crawford, you might want to

object. The witness can't know your

state of mind.

CRAWFORD

No thank you, your honor.

KANG

I would say so, yes.

WILLY

Thank you, Dr. Kang.

WILLY

So after you put down your gun, what

did Mr. Crawford do?

47

NUNALLY

He confessed to shooting his wife.

WILLY

He confessed.

(Beat)

Did Mr. Crawford appear confused or in

any way intoxicated, impaired?

NUNALLY

No. Not at all. He knew what was

going on.

WILLY

What did Mr. Crawford say?

NUNALLY

He said, "I got the gun and I shot my

wife. God help me, I shot her in the

head. I know it was wrong."

CRAWFORD

(low, still drawing)

Objection.

JUDGE ROBINSON

I'm sorry - Mr. Crawford, did you say

something?

CRAWFORD

Yes.   I want to object.

JUDGE ROBINSON

On what grounds?

CRAWFORD

I don't know.

WILLY

Your honor -

CRAWFORD

I don't know what you'd call it. They

- it wasn't the first time, either,

but - I don't know the legal term.

48

JUDGE ROBINSON

Why don't you just explain it in

layman's terms.

CRAWFORD

Fucking the victim.

JUDGE ROBINSON

Mr. Crawford -

CRAWFORD

You said layman's terms -

WILLY

Your honor -

CRAWFORD

I'm sorry - what would you call it -

legally - when the officer who

arrested you has been having sexual

intercourse with your wife?

WILLY

(Low)

Oh - shit.

CRAWFORD

I think it's objectionable - maybe I'm

wrong.

WILLY

Your honor...

JUDGE ROBINSON

Detective Nunally?

CRAWFORD

Rob?

WILLY

Your honor, the People request a -

49

WILLY

He had my witness list.   He should

have filed to suppress.

CRAWFORD

(Shrugs)

My mistake. Sorry.

JUDGE ROBINSON

Mr. Crawford, I warned you about

representing yourself.

CRAWFORD

What about the fact that it's true?

I mean, isn't that the point here: to

get to the truth?

JUDGE ROBINSON

Mr. Slocum - is it true?

WILLY

I don't know. I only heard about it

five minutes ago.

CRAWFORD

Put him back on the witness stand if

you don't believe me.

WILLY

We can't put him back on now! Not

after what the jury just saw. Your

honor, I told you this would turn into

a circus. First he provokes the

witness with an outrageous allegation -

CRAWFORD

My Dick has evidence.

JUDGE ROBINSON

Excuse me?

CRAWFORD

My investigator. I call him Dick. I

guess I should call him as a rebuttal

(MORE)

50

CRAWFORD (cont'd)

witness? He's got phone records,

credit receipts, photographs,

videotapes - all documenting the

affair. In graphic detail.

(Beat. Mildly:)

Dick is good.

WILLY

Okay - um: I'll stipulate that my

witness was less than forthcoming

...and that can more or less cancel

out the fact that the defendant

withheld a crucial -

JUDGE ROBINSON

Mr. Slocum - your witness was intimate

with the victim, and he assaulted the

defendant during the arrest.

CRAWFORD

Actually, while obtaining my so-called

"confession."

WILLY

No way.   Your honor -

JUDGE ROBINSON

He's got a point. They were alone in

the house. The confession is no good.

WILLY

Oh - come on!

CRAWFORD

Is this a legal argument?       "Oh come

on"?

WILLY

(Whirls on him)

You want to get into it?!

WILLY

Sorry.

(Beat)

He dictated and signed his confession,

after that incident.

51

JUDGE ROBINSON

In police custody. Arguably, in fear

for his life. I'm sorry, Mr. Slocum -

it's all 'fruit of the tainted tree.'

We have to exclude all versions of the

confession and any evidence collected

by Lieutenant Nunally or by other

police officers on the night he was

present.

WILLY

This is insane!

CRAWFORD

It's Biblical, isn't it?   The fruit

and the tree and -

WILLY

He set this up! Don't you see what

he's doing?!

JUDGE ROBINSON

Yes, I do. And I don't like it. But

it's done, so we have to deal with it.

CRAWFORD

Do you think I could go home today,

your honor? With Thanksgiving around

the corner -

JUDGE ROBINSON

Don't push it, Mr. Crawford.

(Beat)

What we're going to do is give Mr.

Slocum a few days to regroup and come

up with new evidence. If he doesn't -

then you can go home. That's going to

put us into the long weekend. We

reconvene Monday morning.

52

WILLY

Willy Slocum.

INTERCUT WITH:

NIKKI

Well - you've gotta admire the

cleverness of it.

WILLY

Do I?

NIKKI (V.O.)

Come on, Willy - give the devil his

due.

WILLY (V.O.)

Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out

what that is.

NIKKI

Okay: then listen - I checked with Bob

on how he wants you to handle this.

(MORE)

53

NIKKI (cont'd)

Has LoBruto tried to take you off the

case yet?

WILLY

No.

NIKKI

Well, he pretty much has to if he's

gonna save any face. So here's the

strategy: you let him.

WILLY

I let him?

NIKKI (V.O.)

Yeah, damage control. Stop getting

your face on TV. As it is, I had to

talk Bob down from cancelling your

contract.

NIKKI (CONT'D)

But we've got to move fast and get out

from under. Otherwise, and I quote:

"Stick a fork in this kid's ass and

turn him over, he's done."

WILLY

I can't just - walk away.

NIKKI

Willy: today, you got killed. The

issue now is saving your new life.

WILLY

I guess...that would be the smart way

of looking at it.

54

NIKKI

You want to come out and get drunk?

WILLY

No. Thank you. I've got some stuff

to take care of.

NIKKI

All right.    Don't beat yourself up.

WILLY

I won't.

LOBRUTO

You don't look into who the victim

was sleeping with?

WILLY

He - threw me off.

(Frustrated)

Look, Crawford knew he'd be the prime

suspect, so he gave us everything -

but he made it all radioactive. The

night this went down, it was over.

LOBRUTO

But you still walked   it into court,

Willy. We might not    have a case...but

it didn't have to be   a public

humiliation for this   office and the

police department.

55

WILLY

Are you taking me off?

LOBRUTO

You're leaving anyway.

WILLY

I'm starting to get a sense of this

guy.

LOBRUTO

That's not new evidence.

WILLY

I can take him now: he thinks he's

smarter than I am.

LOBRUTO

It's not about you, Willy.

WILLY

Yeah, it is. He made it that way.

(Shows him the egg)

He likes me.

LOBRUTO

What is that - some kind of Oklahoma

insult?

WILLY

Let me do this. I won't make you look

bad.

LOBRUTO

No. You won't. That's what I need to

make sure you understand. I remove

you now: I'm covered, I took some

action.

(Beat)

If you go on with this, when you lose -

blame has to come down. And it'll

come down on you. I'll have to

investigate you for improprieties,

incompetence - anything I can. In

public. I'll hang you out to dry.

For the good of this office.

WILLY

If I lose.

56

LOBRUTO

What?

WILLY

You said "when."

LOBRUTO

All right.   It's yours.

WILLY

You're not easy to find.      I had to

call Internal Affairs.

NUNALLY

Yeah - they put me on a desk - 'til

this gets...sorted out.

NUNALLY

Got home - my wife already took the

kids to her folks. Press is all over

our front lawn. Friggin' vampires.

WILLY

What the hell were you thinking.

You're on the job and you get called

to your girlfriend's house -

57

NUNALLY

I didn't know it was her house.      I'd

never been there.

WILLY

It was her name!

NUNALLY

I didn't know her name!

NUNALLY

No last names. Her rules. We met at

the same hotel room, twice a week - no

phone calls, no questions. She didn't

want us to know too much about each

other. She said it was like...travel

in a foreign country. No baggage -

from our lives. Just us. Escaping.

WILLY

Did you get the feeling she had rules

because she had done it before? With

other guys?

NUNALLY

No.  I don't know. Maybe.

(Thinking, remembering:)

No. It was all just this...crazy

thing. For both of us. It was...

real. You know? We didn't expect

that, when we started. We didn't know

where it was going. I had cheated so

many times, I was numb - but she was

...new. And she made me feel like

there was - some chance. To change.

We were scared. It was like we were

afraid to go forward, but we couldn't

go back.

(Beat)

You always think you have time. To

work it out. Or make things right.

(Angry)

What was I supposed to do?!

WILLY

You were supposed to tell me!

NUNALLY

I'm married!    I have kids!

58

WILLY

You thought nobody knew - so maybe you

could just walk away clean.

NUNALLY

No! I didn't think HE knew! OKAY?!

Even - after. I thought it was just -

massively fouled-up...bad luck. Like -

God - telling me - something.

(Anguished)

I'm there. My mind is going crazy. I

know the confession won't hold if

anyone finds out.

(Beat)

I thought the guy was a whack!

WILLY

Yeah?   Well, he's not.

WILLY

Is there anything else you can give

me. Anything that might get us some

evidence.

NUNALLY

I...tried to warn you.

WILLY

You warned me he was smart. You

didn't warn me you were stupid.

NUNALLY

How do we get the confession back in?

WILLY

We don't.

NUNALLY

What are you gonna do?

59

WILLY

Shake the boxes.

DEPUTY

Huh?

WILLY

The cereal boxes - shake 'em. And

there's a chicken in the freezer.

Thaw it out, check inside.

60

WILLY

The garage?    Washer-dryer?

MARCHAND

And the tool shed, and the roof, and

the H.V.A.C. ducts.

WILLY

What about the door frames?    The

floors?

MARCHAND

What did he do: rip open a door frame,

hide the gun inside and re-plaster the

wall before SWAT showed up?

WILLY

What about the neighbors' property?

He could have thrown it over the

hedges.

MARCHAND

We checked.

(Beat)

He might have passed it off to

somebody, Willy. Had an accomplice,

waiting, out the back.

61

WILLY

This isn't an accomplice sort of guy.

WILLY

This is a...guy who likes to show off.

WILLY

You sure?

MARCHAND

I'm sure.

WILLY

It's a physical object. It can't just

vanish. We're missing something -

some step in the story.

WILLY

The neighbor sees her get home. He's

already inside. She lets herself in.

A minute or two later: blood-pattern

says she's standing over there - he's

somewhere around here.

WILLY

Boom.

MARCHAND

But then he carries her back there.

Why?

62

WILLY

Because he's gonna need time. To

confess. When she's alone with the

cop.

MARCHAND

Neighbor comes to the door.

WILLY

Crawford shouts, "Leave us alone" and

fires three more rounds: boom-boom-

boom.

MARCHAND

So everybody knows he's dangerous -

and she might still be alive.

WILLY

So they'll call the Negotiator.

(Beat)

Now he's got about ten minutes.

MARCHAND

I'm sorry, Willy.

WILLY (V.O.)

Do you dare stay out?

Do you dare go in?

63

WILLY (V.O.)

And IF you go in -

Should you turn left or right?

Or right and three-quarters?

Or maybe not quite.

WILLY (V.O.)

You can get so confused that you'll

start in to race,

Down long wiggled roads at break-

necking pace

WILLY (V.O.)

And grind on for miles across weirdish

wild space,

Headed I fear, toward a most useless

place.

WILLY (V.O.)

The Waiting Place...

For people just waiting.

Waiting for a train to go

Or a bus to come, or a plane to go

WILLY (V.O.)

Or the mail to come, or the rain to go

Or the phone to ring, or the snow to

snow

64

WILLY (V.O.)

Or waiting around for a Yes or No

Or waiting for their hair to grow.

Everyone is just waiting.

WILLY (V.O.)

Waiting for the fish to bite

Or waiting for wind to fly a kite

Or waiting around for Friday night

Or waiting perhaps for their Uncle

Jake

WILLY

Or a pot to boil, or a Better Break

Or a string of pearls, or a pair of

pants

Or a wig with curls...

Or Another Chance.

RESIDENT (O.S.)

What are you doing?

WILLY

I heard it might - help - if somebody

talked to her.

RESIDENT

Who told you that?

WILLY

(Reluctantly)

The man who shot her.

65

WILLY

Is there any chance...she might come

out of this?

RESIDENT

Are you a member of the family?

WILLY

(Getting out ID)

Sorry. I'm with the District

Attorney's office.

(Beat)

We don't have any other witnesses.

RESIDENT

This woman had a bullet plow through

her brain.

WILLY

I know. But you hear about people

waking up from comas. After everybody

said pull the plug - they wake up.

(Beat)

You hear stuff like that all the time.

RESIDENT

You hear about Elvis and Aliens, too.

All the time.

WILLY

It's not impossible, though. Is it?

I mean - why else are you keeping her

like this?

RESIDENT

No. It's not impossible. But even if

she did, she might not remember how to

talk - let alone anything about how

she was shot.

WILLY

When I was here alone before, she

moved a little.

RESIDENT

Are you just going to keep asking the

same question in different ways until

you hear the answer you want?

66

WILLY

That's how it works with the law.

RESIDENT

I knew I should have gone to law

school.

WILLY

So this is all exactly how he left it.

TINA

Yes.

WILLY

And he was - distraught.

TINA

He was drinking. The past few weeks.

WILLY

But he was working on this.

WILLY

All distraught and everything.

TINA

Do you want coffee.    He said I should

ask.

67

WILLY

Tell him I said no thank you.

WILLY

How long do you keep the tapes?

ASSISTANT MANAGER

A month.

WILLY

Can I get a copy of October 9th?

ASSISTANT MANAGER

I'll have it for you Friday.

WILLY

I'm kind of under the gun here.

ASSISTANT MANAGER

We're short-staffed tonight and

tomorrow.

ASSISTANT MANAGER

Thanksgiving?

WILLY

Right.   Okay.

68

GARDNER

White or dark, Willy?

WILLY

Anything is fine, your honor.

GARDNER

I'm off-duty, you can call me Lew.

WILLY

So - is everyone in this family

involved in the law?

SANDRA

Well, Nikki's not.

NIKKI

Ha ha.

(To Willy:)

Burton's a counsel for Sierra Club,

and Sandra's ACLU - so they use the

holidays as an opportunity to give me

a hard time, because I can buy and

sell them.

SANDRA

We're not actually for sale, Nick.

GARDNER

Nicole decided early-on that black

sheep was the most effective role in

which to distinguish herself from her

siblings.

69

NIKKI

You know of any other family in

America where the corporate lawyer

who's going to make partner by thirty-

five is the "black sheep"?

GARDNER

Well - you may be lost beyond

recovery, but maybe we can still

convince Willy that defending giant

corporations against injured citizens

is not the best use of his skills.

WILLY

I don't think so, sir.

(smiles)

It's where the money is.

GARDNER

(Scolding mildly)

I believe that phrase refers to banks.

And it was coined by a thief.

WILLY

Times have changed.

NIKKI

(To Willy)

You don't have to do this.

WILLY

I don't mind; I get this kind of thing

now and then.

(to Gardner)

Almost always from people with money.

GARDNER

Appearances can be deceiving, Willy.

I grew up with eight brothers and

sisters on a farm up in Fresno, and I

promise you I saw my share of hard

times.

WILLY

My mom OD'd fairly frequently, so they

put me in a Group Home. My younger

sister is dead and my older brother is

doing twenty-five-to-life.

70

GARDNER

You win.

WILLY

I usually do.

GARDNER

(Gently)

Yes.    I see that.

BURTON

I don't know if you will against the

wife-shooter, though.

SANDRA

Whoops.

NIKKI

Nice, Burton.

WILLY

It's not over 'til it's over.

BURTON

That looked pretty over.

NIKKI

Anyway, Willy's been taken off the

case.

GARDNER

It might not seem like it now, but

that's a blessing in disguise, Willy.

WILLY

I wasn't.

NIKKI

What?

71

WILLY

Taken off.

NIKKI

That...doesn't make any sense.

Lobruto has to do some kind of damage

control -

WILLY

I asked him not to.

NIKKI

You are really stupid, did you know

that?

WILLY

I'm - getting new evidence -

NIKKI

Where? The Evidence Store?! Oh,

that's right - they open early the day

after Thanksgiving. You're gonna be

fine!

WILLY

Did it ever occur to you I might be

good enough to still win?!

NIKKI

Who cares?!

Win what?

WILLY

The man shot his -

NIKKI

You wanted corporate, right?! You

wanted to play in the big leagues?!

WILLY

Yeah, I'm just -

NIKKI

You go to all that trouble getting

yourself in - and then you just pay no

attention to wh-

72

WILLY

Look - I'm sorry - can we not talk

about this here?!

NIKKI

Fine.

WILLY

Thank you.

NIKKI

I need to talk with you.

WILLY

Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you -

NIKKI

Did you hear me, when I said Bob

wanted you gone as soon as this thing

broke?! Did you hear me say I went

out on a limb to convince him -

WILLY

Wouldn't it be better than damage

control if I actually turn it around?

NIKKI

And what if you don't?

NIKKI

You don't get it at all, do you?! You

pulled a stunt to get yourself this

job. Fine: you're a hot-shot!

(Beat)

Wooton Sims does not need hot-shots.

Because you don't win. The firm wins.

Bob wins.

(MORE)

73

NIKKI (cont'd)

(Beat)

And you just put yourself head-to-head

in conflict with Bob.

WILLY

What am I supposed to do?

NIKKI

We told the man you're getting on a

plane to Chicago, Tuesday.

WILLY

Yeah.   Okay.

WILLY

I think maybe I'm gonna go now.

NIKKI

All right.

(Beat)

Call if you want.

WILLY

I've got some work to do.

I need to call a cab.

GARDNER

You know what nobody understands about

certain kinds of underpaid public

service work? Now and then you get to

put a fucking stake in a bad guy's

heart. We're not supposed to talk

about that when we visit a third-grade

class on Career Day, and it doesn't

get you very far into the country-club

locker room - but it's hard to beat

when you actually get to do it.

74

WILLY

Shit!

WILLY

The hell are you doing here?

NUNALLY

We need to talk.

NUNALLY

We have to find the gun.

WILLY

Thank you, Professor Einstein. It

would also be good to find a couple of

(MORE)

75

WILLY (cont'd)

eyewitnesses. If one could be the

Dalai Lama, it would be even better.

NUNALLY

No - Willy: we need to find the gun.

WILLY

I've had three different teams here -

NUNALLY

He didn't leave between the shooting

and when we took him out in cuffs.

The gun is here.

(beat)

So we have to find it.

WILLY

Well - we can't! You want to move on?

NUNALLY

There's a guy in the Evidence Room,

owes me a favor. Well - it's not so

much a favor as I know stuff about

him. He can trade this for the bullet

from Jennifer, give us a ballistic

match.

WILLY

It's a crime.

NUNALLY

So who's gonna get away with a crime -

this asshole, or us?

WILLY

Go home.

NUNALLY

What else have you got?!

WILLY

I'll find a way.

76

NUNALLY

No you won't.

77

MARCHAND

Willy.     There's nothing here.

WILLY

Guns don't just walk out of crime

scenes.

MARCHAND

Two months before he shot his wife,

this guy had his investigator watching

the cop at work. He knew exactly how

it would go down - and he didn't leave

any loose ends.

WILLY

Then what is this:

WILLY

Hotel surveillance.     From that day.

He was there. Why?

MARCHAND

Had to see it for himself.

WILLY

See what?     They were out at the pool.

MARCHAND

The unmade bed. Her panties. Man's

gonna shoot his wife in the head, he

needs to get himself all worked up.

78

WILLY

Yeah.     Worked up.

MARCHAND

Willy, go home. Tomorrow you go back

into court and take your lumps - then

you start your cushy new life, and you

forget all about this one.

(Hoping to get a smile:)

And then you can lend me money and

shit.

DISSOLVE TO:

79

NUNALLY

It's done. In the tool shed: taped to

the blade, inside the lawn-mower.

MONA

You okay?

WILLY

Yeah.  Maybe.

(Hesitates)

Can I ask you to do something for me

this morning?

MONA

Sure.

WILLY

Write down your cell number.

(As she does)

Once my trial is in session, wait

outside. I might call - and just hang

up. If I do, I want you to come into

court and whisper to me that we got a

tip about the murder weapon.

MONA

You found it?

80

WILLY

I haven't decided yet.

MONA

Oh: this came for you.

We only win the favor of the Gods

by making a sacrifice

See you tomorrow

- Nikki

81

WILLY

So - between the time you heard the

first gunshot and called 911, and the

time of Mr. Crawford's arrest - you

had the Crawford house in view?

GIFFORD

Yes. I was very concerned about

Jennifer. She was a lovely woman.

WILLY

No one but Thomas Crawford came in or

out?

GIFFORD

That's correct.

WILLY

Thank you, Mr. Gifford.    No further

questions.

JUDGE ROBINSON

Mr. Crawford?

CRAWFORD

Did you see the guy run out the back

door?

GIFFORD

What..."guy"?

CRAWFORD

The other guy. The one who shot my

wife. Did you see him run out the

back of the house, carrying the gun?

82

GIFFORD

I couldn't see the back of the house.

(Trying to salvage it:)

I believe...the police went around

back when they arrived.

CRAWFORD

No further questions.

WILLY

Re-direct, your honor.

CRAWFORD

I've also written a motion to dismiss.

WILLY

Objection - I'm on re-direct!

JUDGE ROBINSON

On what grounds, Mr. Crawford?

CRAWFORD

The prosecutor doesn't have any actual

evidence.

WILLY

I'm in the middle of presenting -

CRAWFORD

All of his witnesses are going to

testify to the same facts: that my

wife was shot and that I was,

tragically, in the house at the time

...a witness - and, in a way, a victim

myself. I'll stipulate to Mr.

Slocum's entire witness list right

now, a request a directed verdict or

dismissal, per California versus

Collier, 1982, and the Appellate court

decision, v. Watrus, 486.19.

83

JUDGE

Your legal skills seem to have

improved over the long weekend, Mr.

Crawford.

JUDGE ROBINSON

Mr. Slocum?

JUDGE ROBINSON

Have you got any new evidence?

WILLY

May I have a moment, your honor?

JUDGE ROBINSON

Mr. Slocum?

84

CRAWFORD

Your honor? Can we signal the

prosecutor from here on planet Earth?

JUDGE ROBINSON

Mr. Slocum?     Now or never.

WILLY

I have no further evidence at this

time, your honor.

85

JUDGE ROBINSON

Motion to dismiss is granted.

JUDGE ROBINSON

Order! The jury is released, with our

apologies -

JUDGE ROBINSON

- and the Defendant is free to go.

CRAWFORD

Even a broken clock gets to be right

twice a day.

INTERCUT WITH:

86

NIKKI

Hey, you.

WILLY

(It's an effort)

Hey.

NIKKI

What did you think - I wasn't keeping

tabs?

WILLY

I don't know what I thought.

NIKKI

Listen: what do you say I take you out

tonight and get you completely

trashed? Tomorrow's just a travel da-

WILLY

Hang on -

87

WILLY

Your husband said something...that I

can't seem to shake loose of. He said

I'm a winner.

(Beat)

And he's right. I can't lose. I

can't stand people who lose.

(Beat)

I may have been working so hard to put

some distance between me and...people

like you - that maybe I messed up. I

don't know if did anything wrong.

Or what I should have done. I really

don't know, any more...what I'm

supposed to do.

(Beat)

But I feel like I let you down.

Somehow in the...process. And if I

did, I'm sorry. That's all. I just -

I hope you...have...just, some...

(Beat)

Anyway.

88

WILLY

She was looking at me.

RESIDENT

Yeah, I understand -

WILLY

No, she was looking at me.

WILLY

She's reacting.

WILLY

You see?

RESIDENT

The normal reflex goes downward.   Up

indicates brain trauma.

WILLY

She's in there. She was looking at

me.

89

RESIDENT

Sometimes we have to tape their eyes

shut. They all move - they make

sounds, they twitch. You think

they're dreaming. But they're not.

It's just what's left of the system,

sending broken signals.

WILLY

Can we do other tests? Like an M.R.I.

or something? And I want a coma

specialist to see her.

RESIDENT

You're not authorized to order tes-

WILLY

I'll get you authorization.      First

thing tomorrow.

RESIDENT

You get the paperwork, I'll do what I

can.

CRAWFORD

Mr. Slocum.

WILLY

Just...visiting.

CRAWFORD

This isn't like you at all.

WILLY

No?

90

CRAWFORD

You haven't got anything to gain.

WILLY

Oh - right. That's my weak spot.

(Beat)

Ever think about what yours might be?

Your flaw?

CRAWFORD

Of course I have.

(Leans in)

The truth about me is, Willy...I'm

really not very nice.

WILLY

You sure do know a lot, though. Got

everybody all figured out, everything

set up, like one of your contraptions.

Then you just sit back and watch it

all fall right where you want it to.

Must be kind of...boring. At that

point.

CRAWFORD

Not an ounce of sympathy, Willy?

(Beat)

Imagine it - imagine she was yours.

And you knew you were losing her.

(beat)

Imagine days. Weeks. Going through

her desk. Her purse. Her closet.

Alone. Staring at her clothes. Her

shoes. Knowing this is what it will

be like. After.

(beat)

Do you have any idea how hard it was

to go on living - with her - every

day, knowing?

WILLY

But you had to, right? You needed

time to set it all up...your "crime of

passion."

CRAWFORD

There are many kinds of passion,

Willy.

91

WILLY

Yeah.  There are.

(Beat)

So - thank you.

WILLY

For sharing your wisdom. All your

little helpful bits of information.

(Beat)

You were right.

CRAWFORD

About...?

WILLY

Talking to her.

WILLY

Hi, I'm just -

WILLY

Excuse me - I'm new, I just started -

and there's something wrong with my

card. Can you buzz me in?

RECEPTIONIST

Who are you here to see?

WILLY

I work here.    Willy Slocum.    I'm new -

92

WILLY

Nikki Gardner. Willy Slocum, for

Nikki Gardner.

WILLY

Wait a second - never mind, here she

is, thank you.

WILLY

Hey...Bob -

(To Nikki)

Can I talk to you for a second?

WILLY

You let him know what happened last

night?

NIKKI

I told him.

WILLY

Great - who do I work with on it while

you're gone?

NIKKI

You don't work with anyone.

WILLY

Nikki: the man has power-of-attorney

and a health-care proxy, he can

disconnect her life-support whenever

he wants. If we don't move fast -

NIKKI

Jesus, Willy, wake up! It's over!

What is wrong with you - it's first

year law: that woman could fully

recover and swear he shot her and it

(MORE)

93

NIKKI (cont'd)

wouldn't matter. Double jeopardy!

You can't take him back into court!

WILLY

I told you - we bring a civil suit -

NIKKI

You've got no standing.

WILLY

It doesn't have to stick: we just need

to get a court order for now - to keep

Crawford from pulling the plug! With

all the brain-power here, I'm sure

somebody can come up with a pretext or

call in a favor. Then we can tie this

up in court while we arrange a state-

appointed conservatorship - so we can

protect her while we fight him on -

NIKKI

What's the point, Willy?

WILLY

The point?!

WILLY

This man is going to kill his wife.

NIKKI

Yeah.

(Beat)

What does that have to do with Wooton

Sims?

NIKKI

I warned you.

WILLY

No, this is insane.

NIKKI

It's what it is.

94

NIKKI

I warned you.

WILLY

You're not really just gonna let this

happen, are you?!

NIKKI

Oh I'm supposed to lose my job over

your problems?!

WILLY

My problems?! Wait a second - this is

not about my anything any more -

WILLY

This is about taking a couple of

goddamn weeks off to try and save a

woman's life!

WILLY

Don't bother.     I got it.

95

JUDGE ROBINSON

What do the doctors say?

WILLY

People wake up out of these things.

JUDGE ROBINSON

What did the doctors say, Mr. Slocum?

WILLY

They said...there's no way to really

know. I'm trying to get them to run

more tests - but I was there, and I'm

telling you.

96

JUDGE ROBINSON

I'm sorry. I have no probable cause

to issue a court order against Mr.

Crawford - and he's protected agai-

WILLY

WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE?!   WHAT'S

PROTECTING HER?!

WILLY

I'm sorry - but nobody else seems to

give a damn that sooner or later this

guy is gonna finish what he started.

LOBRUTO

Have you been home at all today,

Willy?

97

WILLY

No - I've been trying to get some-

LOBRUTO

There's a court order out against you.

WILLY

What?

LOBRUTO

A restraining order.

(Beat)

You were at the hospital?       Talking to

her doctors?

LOBRUTO

Crawford hired a lawyer this time.

They saw Judge Gorman this afternoon.

WILLY

Against me.

LOBRUTO

You need to stay away from him, and

his wife, and the hospital. He can

have you arrested if you don't.

(Beat)

I'm sorry.

(beat)

I can't help you. I told you how it

would go.

WILLY

Can you do anything for her?

LOBRUTO

I don't see how.

98

DR. LUNT

Has Mrs. Crawford been prepared?

99

WILLY

Can I use your fax machine?

GARDNER

These have to be served in person.

WILLY

Move it if you need to!

100

NURSE

You just missed her.

WILLY

What?

NURSE

She just went on up.

WILLY

How long ago...did she die?

NURSE

What?

(Beat)

The roof.

(Beat)

(MORE)

101

NURSE (cont'd)

Medevac transfer. Out to a long-term

care facility up in Santa Barbara.

They just left, you can probably still

catch 'em.

WILLY

He's - moving her by helicopter?

NURSE

Nothing but the best.

DR. LUNT

This orders him not to take her off

life support! He's not! We can't

stop the man from -

WILLY

Then just hold it - for a couple of

hours! Have it inspected!

102

DR. LUNT

You're talking about a phenomenally

expensive delay, Mr. Slocum - when the

man has every right to move his wife!

WILLY

She's not gonna get there!

WILLY

This man is a mechanical engineer with

expertise in air crashes! He has

access to airfields and he knows

exactly how to make it look like an

accident! You know what he did! You

know why she's like this!

103

WILLY

Why are we going out over the ocean?

PILOT

Less traffic.

104

WILLY

We have to turn back!

PILOT

Get in your seat!

WILLY

He's doing something - we have to turn

back!

PILOT

Who's doing something?

WILLY

He is!   You have to get us DOWN!

PILOT

Get back in your goddamn seat!

CRAWFORD

Willy, I'm not doing anything.

Everyone can see that.

WILLY

I'm TELLING you, we have to TURN BACK!

He's DOING SOMETH-

WILLY

What's happening?!

MED TECH

I don't know - I'm - there's a -

malfunction -

105

MED TECH

I can't do anything with this, up

here.

CRAWFORD

She's D.N.R.

WILLY

What is it?

CRAWFORD

Check.

WILLY

What?

MED TECH

She's Do Not Resuscitate.

CRAWFORD

It's in her living will.

MED TECH

She's D.N.R.    She signed it.

WILLY

There's a restraining order - she's

protected - I'm authorizing you to do

it!

CRAWFORD

No extraordinary measures.

(Turns to Willy)

Unless your court order specifies

(MORE)

106

CRAWFORD (cont'd)

contravening her living will. But I

don't think it would. I think you got

one that forbids me from disconn-

PILOT

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON BACK THERE?!

WILLY

Wait!    WAIT - LOOK!

WILLY

Yes.     Yes.

WILLY

You messed up. With all your plans

and games.

WILLY

Shhhh.    It's okay.       It's all right.

WILLY

You're gonna be okay?

WILLY

Jennifer?       Hang on.

107

WILLY

Jennifer?!     JENNIFER?!

WILLY

No.     Come on, Jennifer.    Fight back.

WILLY

Don't let go.

CRAWFORD

You pushed it, Willy. We didn't have

to be here.

(Beat)

But now you're my witness. You saw:

I didn't touch anything, I didn't do

anything. The machine went down.

Anybody asks - you'll have to tell

them. What you saw.

(Beat)

That's really kind of perfect, isn't

it?

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

108

LOBRUTO

You're not answering your phone.

WILLY

That's kind of an answer in itself,

isn't it?

LOBRUTO

Where are you headed?

WILLY

Haven't decided yet.    Just someplace

else.

LOBRUTO

I shouldn't have let it get so far out

of control.

(Beat)

We all lose, Willy.

WILLY

Yep.

LOBRUTO

We just have to live with that, and

keep fighting the good fight.

WILLY

That's not what I was doing.

LOBRUTO

You belong in a courtroom.

WILLY

I need to - get to know myself better.

LOBRUTO

You're a good lawyer. All this may

have even made you a better lawyer.

Don't waste it.

109

WILLY

I didn't just lose a case!     I let a

man get away with murder.

LOBRUTO

If it makes you feel any better -

technically, you let a man get away

with attempted murder.

WILLY

His wife is dead!

WILLY

We can still get him.    We can take him

back to court.

LOBRUTO

(Gently)

Willy...

WILLY

Double jeopardy doesn't apply! We

bring a new charge - of homicide.

LOBRUTO

Willy - what happened to you, on the

helicopter - we don't even know if we

could prove -

110

WILLY

No: he shot her and she died. The

fact that it took time - the fact that

he went to trial in between, just for

shooting her - doesn't matter. He

fired a gun and caused her death, and

that's murder.

(Beat)

If he can twist the law around - then

so can we.

LOBRUTO

A second indictment on the same

incident?

WILLY

A man burns down a house; we charge

him with arson. There were people

sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in

the hospital, they die. We'd charge

him with murder. Right?

LOBRUTO

All your evidence is still toxic.      The

confession, the arrest - it's all

still inadmissible.

LOBRUTO

I'm sorry, Willy. It was a good idea,

but -

WILLY

I'll get something new.

LOBRUTO

How?

WILLY

You don't want to know.

LOBRUTO

Willy, you can't -

111

WILLY

I don't work for you.

(Beat)

Right?

LOBRUTO

Don't do anything crazy.

WILLY

What else have we got left?

WILLY

I need a favor.

CRAWFORD

These are from that thing at the

courthouse, right?

WILLY

Uh-huh.

112

CRAWFORD

Very dramatic.

WILLY

You ain't seen nothin' yet.

WILLY

I want the gun.

CRAWFORD

Why?   You've already got one.

WILLY

I want the gun you shot your wife

with. Now.

WILLY

One way or another, I'm going to see

to it you receive justice tonight.

CRAWFORD

You're serious, aren't you.

WILLY

Oh, yes.

CRAWFORD

(A smile dawning)

Willy. You got religion, didn't you?!

You care. That's...priceless.

113

CRAWFORD

No, it's very sweet. Really.

WILLY

Gonna be a whole lot less funny in

about a minute.

CRAWFORD

Getting it like this: is that going to

hold up in court?

WILLY

I don't work for the D.A. any more.

I'm just a guy who broke into your

house. When the police arrest me -

they'll inventory anything in my

possession. If that happens to be

crucial evidence in another case,

well: some prosecutor just got lucky.

CRAWFORD

It takes a very special kind of person

to look right into someone's eyes and

pull the trigger. It takes a unique

kind of strength.

WILLY

I guess you'd know that.

CRAWFORD

Yes.    I would.

CRAWFORD

I don't think so.

WILLY

You don't know me.

CRAWFORD

No?

114

CRAWFORD

Then I'm in for a - rude awakening.

CRAWFORD

Tick-tock.

CRAWFORD

Where did you even get yourself a gun?

WILLY

(Bitter)

It's Nunally's.

CRAWFORD

Nunally's.    Really.

WILLY

Yeah.    Really.

WILLY

There I was, with a perfectly good

weapon just sitting in the evidence

warehouse.

CRAWFORD

Willy.    Put it down.

115

WILLY

I thought you might appreciate the

...irony.

CRAWFORD

Willy.   Think.

WILLY (V.O.)

"A perfectly good...Heckler and Koch

nine-millimeter."

CRAWFORD

The police will be here very soon.

WILLY

The exact same type of gun you bought

your wife, a month before.

CRAWFORD

If they see you with a gun in your

hand - they're not likely to ask a lot

of questions.

116

WILLY

That's why you went to the hotel.

WILLY (V.O.)

That's why you went into the room.

WILLY

You took his gun.

WILLY (V.O.)

And you left him yours.

CRAWFORD

I gave it back.

WILLY

Yes you did.

117

WILLY (V.O.)

After you'd used it.

WILLY (V.O.)

Then you told Nunally you'd put it

down - if he put down his.

WILLY

That's why you moved her back there -

CRAWFORD (V.O.)

The truth is I could have done it

right in front of the man and he

wouldn't have noticed.

CRAWFORD

He had...other things on his mind.

118

WILLY (V.O.)

And all you had to do was switch the

guns back - in the commotion -

WILLY (V.O.)

- and then wait -

WILLY (V.O.)

- until Nunally walked the murder

weapon right out of the house.

WILLY

Brilliant.

CRAWFORD

You know, this is really kind of fun.

It's like showing some caveman a

cigarette lighter.

WILLY

This caveman's gonna put you in prison

for the rest of your life.

CRAWFORD

It's still not evidence, Willy.

There's no prints left by now.

Nothing ties that gun to me.

119

WILLY

No. That would be true.        Except for

all those eggs.

CRAWFORD

Those what?

WILLY

With all those little cracks and weak

places. Like Nunally. Shooting

himself, right there in the

courthouse. I didn't think he was

going to do that. Did you?

CRAWFORD

(Wary)

No.

WILLY

I mean, we all knew he was going to

fall apart sooner or later. That was

part of your plan, right? Like a bank

shot, on a pool table: you kill your

wife - and destroy her lover. With

one bullet.

(Turns)

Well: four bullets, actually. Right?

WILLY

First bullet goes into your wife.

INTERCUT QUICK FLASHBACKS:

WILLY (V.O.)

Then three more out the front of the

house, to get some attention.

WILLY

Then while you're waiting for the show

to begin - you have to reload

Nunally's gun.

120

WILLY (V.O.)

I mean, you don't want him wondering

where the hell four bullets went,

considering he never fired his gun

that night.

WILLY

And I'm betting you didn't worry about

fingerprints.

WILLY

I mean, why would you? Nobody's going

to be looking at his gun.

WILLY

And sooner or later, life goes on,

those four incriminating bullets would

get used, and be gone forever.

WILLY (V.O.)

Except Nunally only fired one of those

bullets. Into himself.

121

WILLY

Which means there are still three left

with your fingerprints on them - Tom.

In this clip.

WILLY

Everybody has a weak spot, right?

Some place they break.

THE END
