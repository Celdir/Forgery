You did well out there. You've got

JULIAN

(ON THE PHONE)

Hold on, hold on. What did he say?

JULIAN (CONT'D)

(ON THE PHONE)

No, tell him to stay there. Tell them

both to stay there.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

(ON THE PHONE)

I'm coming over.

CUT TO:

JULIAN

He still in there?

THE LIZARD

... No.

JULIAN

You told him I was coming...

THE LIZARD

Wouldn't listen...

JULIAN

Well maybe you didn't try hard enough.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

When was the last time you slept?

THE LIZARD

Just cause I ain't slept for three days,

don't mean I don't know right from

wrong... and your brother has become

a real problem...

THE LIZARD (CONT'D)

You're not going to cause another

ruckus in my club now - are you?

JULIAN

No.

THE LIZARD

Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and

then he broke my face...

GORDON

Like I always said. One day he's going

to meet the devil.

JULIAN

You know where he is now?

THE LIZARD

Bangkok has millions of people my

friend. You and your brother, you're

lost to my world...

THE LIZARD (CONT'D)

So what you going to do? You wanna come

in? Very good amphetamine in here...

JULIAN

You go. I'm gonna look around. See if

I can find him.

GORDON

Sure--?

JULIAN

Go on.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

Which way'd he go?

THE LIZARD

His brother didn't pay.

GORDON

So? That's his problem.

THE LIZARD

Now it's your problem.

GORDON

I'm with you mate. Billy's fucked--

THE LIZARD

You don't pay his debt - you don't enter.

GORDON

How much...?

CUT TO:

JULIAN

You seen Billy?

MA LONG

Not this evening.

JULIAN

Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking

for him, yeah?

MA LONG

He's not coming in. I tell him to stay

away. He hurt one of my girls Julian.

Not good...

JULIAN

Yeah, well... if you see him, tell him

I'm looking for him...

He was...

CUT TO:

CHANG

(IN THAI)

Is this your daughter?

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

Yes.

CHANG

(IN THAI)

How could you?

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

... What?

CHANG

(IN THAI)

How could you let this happen?

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

I didn't do anything.

CHANG

Well now's your chance.

CHOI YAN LEE

I'm so sorry. Please. Please. Please

don't hurt me. I'm so sorry.

CHANG

(IN THAI)

What are you sorry for?

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

I thought... You were there. He killed

my daughter. I thought you were letting

me...

CHANG

(IN THAI)

Answer the question. What are you sorry

for?

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

I killed the Westerner?

CHANG

(IN THAI)

And why did you do that?

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

He killed my daughter.

CHANG

(IN THAI)

And why did he do that?

CHANG (CONT'D)

(IN THAI)

How old was she?

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

Fifteen...

CHANG

(IN THAI)

You knew what she was doing and you did

nothing.

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

How else can we make money? Four

daughters. No sons. What else could I

do?

CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)

(IN THAI)

What did you expect me to do? You have

to have pity on me. My daughter's just

been murdered.

CHANG

(IN THAI)

This isn't about her. This is about your

other three daughters and making sure

you don't forget them.

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

I won't forget. I promise. Forgive me.

CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)

(IN THAI)

I'll change. I'll be a better man.

CHANG

(IN THAI)

I know.

CUT TO:

VOICE

I set off running

to wake from the dream

My brother's rifle

went into the sheen

I kept on running

Into the south lands

That's where they found me

My head in my hands

CUT TO:

CHANG

The sheriff he asked me

Why I had run

And then it came to me

Just what I had done

And all for no reason

Just one piece of lead

I hung my head

I hung my head.

CHANG

(IN THAI)

So now that they've caught him... What

are they going to do?

KANITA

(IN THAI)

Put him in jail.

CHANG

(IN THAI)

Come on. They haven't got a jail big

enough. Look at the size of him.

KANITA

(IN THAI)

Keep him as a pet?

CHANG

(IN THAI)

But he blew down all their houses. Would

you want to keep a pet that could do

that?

KANITA

(IN THAI)

What if they just let him go?

CHANG

(IN THAI)

How could they be sure he wouldn't do

it again?

KANITA

(IN THAI)

They could ask him...? Very nicely?

CHANG

(IN THAI)

"And so the king and the fairies that

lived in the village said to the

creature: this is your mark which will

stay with you forever. If you ever try

and blow down our village again, it will

heat up until it boils your brains, for

it has magical properties. Go in peace.

JENNA

I'd like to speak to your manager.

CONCIERGE

Yes of course...

MANAGER

Good afternoon madam, what seems to be

the problem?

JENNA

Listen to me... I've just travelled six

thousand miles to see the corpse of my

first born son and I haven't slept for

thirty hours and he says I can't go to

my room.

MANAGER

I'm sorry madam...

JENNA

How much?

MANAGER

... it simply isn't possible.

JENNA

...Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the

fucking key...

MANAGER

Well I might be able to arrange

something...

JENNA

Don't leave the money there. Some

cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket.

JENNA (CONT'D)

Put it in your pocket.

MANAGER

There's really no need--

Put it in your fucking pocket.

JENNA (V.O.)

JENNA

Could it be have been one of the gangs?

Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't

popular.

JENNA

What do you mean?

JULIAN

You know Billy... He was eccentric.

JENNA

But you're going to find out who did

it, right?

JULIAN

I'll make sure it gets done.

JENNA

No, it needs to be you that does it.

We need to show them. Do you understand

what I'm saying?

JULIAN

Yeah, okay, I'll do it.

JENNA

Good.

Love is a burning thing

And it makes a firey ring

Bound by wild desire

(IN THAI)

You can't kill me. I'm a cripple.

KIM YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

Who are you? What do you think you're

doing? Get out or we'll call the police.

JULIAN

Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee.

CHARLIE LING

(IN THAI)

Is your name Choi Yan Lee?

JULIAN

Ask him why he killed my brother.

CHARLIE LING

(IN THAI)

You killed his brother. Big mistake fat

man. Why'd you do it?

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

He murdered my daughter.

CHARLIE LING

He says he killed his daughter.

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please.

I'll give you anything. Anything you

want. My daughters. My shop. Please.

I've paid for what I did. Look at me.

CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)

(IN THAI)

I've paid for what I did. Don't you see?

JULIAN

What's he saying?

CHARLIE LING

He says... He says he's paid for what

he's done. That he's been punished

already.

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

He told me to do it. Then he took my

hand. Look.

JULIAN

Who did that to him?

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

The Angel of Vengeance...

CHARLIE LING

(IN THAI)

It's a lie - he doesn't exist...

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

I'm telling the truth. It was the Angel

of Vengeance.

JULIAN

What's he saying?

CHARLIE LING

He's lying...

JULIAN

Tell me.

CHARLIE LING

It's a story old women tell their grand

children... 'The Angel of Vengeance'

is supposed to come down from the

heavens and judge the living...

restore karma to the world..

JULIAN

How does he do that?

CHARLIE LING

Leads people to their destiny...

That's the myth anyway.

JULIAN

Ask him who cut his hand off.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

Do it.

CHARLIE LING

(IN THAI)

Who turned you into a cripple - and no

bullshit this time.

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI, QUIETLY)

I'm telling you the truth... The Angel

of Vengeance is real... He made me do

it... You've got to believe me... I've

already been judged.

CHARLIE LING

He says it was The Angel of Vengeance...

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

The Angel of Vengeance. Yes. You don't

find the Angel of Vengeance. No. He

finds you.

JULIAN

What's he saying?

CHARLIE LING

(IN THAI)

Pull yourself together fat man. If you

don't talk sense I'll cut off your cock

and shove it down your throat.

CHOI YAN LEE

(IN THAI)

I'm telling you the truth. He'll find

you.

JULIAN

What did he say?

CHARLIE LING

He said you don't find The Angel of

Vengeance. He finds you...

GORDON

Are we going to kill him or what?

GORDON (CONT'D)

What are you doing?

JULIAN

Nothing... We're not going to do

anything... Just leave him. Leave them

all.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JENNA

Did you kill him?

JULIAN

It's a little bit more complicated than

that Mum.

JENNA

Complicated? He killed my son...

What's so fucking complicated about

that?

JULIAN

Mum, calm down...

JENNA

Don't tell me to calm down. I want him

dead.

JENNA (CONT'D)

We don't forgive. Only God does.

JULIAN

I know, you always say that - but this

is different...

JENNA

How?

JULIAN

Maybe... Maybe Billy had it coming...

JENNA

What are you talking about?

JULIAN

...because of what he did.

JENNA

I don't care.

JULIAN

Why?

JENNA

Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered

your brother and we're not going to let

him get away with it.

JULIAN

What if... What if it was The Angel of

Vengeance?

JENNA

The Angel of fucking what...?

JULIAN

...it - or he - restores karma and order

in the world.

JENNA

'Restores' things? Who said anything

about 'restoring' things?

JULIAN

He loves all humans...

JENNA

I don't know what kind of spiritual

journey you're on, but you will kill

HIM--

JULIAN

I'm not, I'm just...

JULIAN (CONT'D)

... I've got to go.

JENNA

How's business?

GORDON

It's alright, yeah. Well, what with

Billy not being around, it's tricky to

be honest...

JENNA

What d'you mean?

GORDON

Well, we're supposed to be moving five

keys out the end of this week. But

Billy's not here, is he?

JENNA

I'm here. Julian's here.

JENNA (CONT'D)

What's gotten into him...? Is he high

or something?

GORDON

I don't know. Earlier today - we had

the guy... The guy that killed Billy.

Had a gun against his face. But then

- nothing...

JENNA

Nothing?

GORDON

Julian let him go. Now there's all this

stuff about angels... I don't know what

the fuck's wrong with him.

JENNA

Not like you...

GORDON

I know how to do what needs to be done.

That's all.

JENNA

So tell me... What did he mean when he

said it was complicated?

GORDON

There's this other guy... Might have

been involved...

JENNA

So we kill them both.

GORDON

We don't know who the other guy is yet...

JENNA

Okay. Well how about we start with the

guy we do know?

CUT TO:

MAI

Sorry I'm late.

JULIAN

It's alright...

MAI

What's wrong?

JULIAN

Nothing.

MAI

See anyone you want us to take home

tonight?

MAI (CONT'D)

What?

JULIAN

Nothing...

MAI

What's with you? You want to get high?

JULIAN

I want you to meet my Mum.

MAI

Is she here?

MAI (CONT'D)

D'you want me to?

MAI (CONT'D)

Why d'you want me to meet her?

JULIAN

To show her... To show that I've got

something here...

MAI

What, like we're a couple?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GORDON

Never come back - you understand me?

GORDON (CONT'D)

Good...

GORDON (CONT'D)

You're a fighter, kid. No doubt about

it. Good luck with that.

CUT TO:

JULIAN

When did you last see him?

LIANG'S SISTER

Last night. He went out.

JULIAN

Did he have any enemies?

LIANG'S SISTER

None.

LIANG'S MOTHER

(IN THAI)

Someone called him.

LIANG'S SISTER

Someone called his mobile.

JULIAN

Who?

LIANG'S SISTER

She doesn't know. They spoke in

English.

JULIAN

This his phone?

JULIAN (CONT'D)

What is it?

THAI MAN (V.O.)

There's some cops here to see you.

JUILAN

What do they want?

THAI MAN (V.O.)

Probably just money. You want me to find

out how much?

JULIAN

No, I'll talk to them.

CUT TO:

JULIAN

Good morning officers. How can I help

you?

KIM

We're investigating the murder of Choi

Yan Lee.

JULIAN

Never heard of him.

KIM

His arm was cut off. Here.

JULIAN

I run a boxing club. Not much call for

one armed men.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

What's this got to do with me?

KIM

He was the father of the girl that was

found dead with your brother.

JULIAN

Then I guess you boys have got a lot

of work to do - so have I, so if you'll

excuse me...

KIM

That's why we're here Mr Hopkins. If

you could just answer our questions.

JULIAN

Sure, sorry. What do you want to know?

KIM

Where were you last night?

JULIAN

With my mum...

JULIAN (CONT'D)

You want to speak to her?

KIM

That wont be necessary at the moment.

JULIAN

Am I suspect?

CHANG

(IN THAI)

This is not the man.

JULIAN

I want you to find out who that guy is.

Okay?

GORDON

Sure. No problem.

JULIAN

Now.

CUT TO:

CHANG

Why are you here?

JULIAN

You're him... Aren't you?

CHANG

Who?

JULIAN

The one who killed my brother.

CHANG

I love all living things.

CHANG (CONT'D)

I restore karma. Is that why you came?

JULIAN

I came here to kill you.

CHANG

What's stopping you?

JULIAN

I don't know...

CHANG

Would you like me to tell you?

CHANG (CONT'D)

You want the Angel of Vengeance.

JULIAN

Yes.

CHANG

Why?

JULIAN

Cause, all my life... I don't know.

CHANG

Yes you do.

JULIAN

My mother wants me to kill you.

CHANG

And what do you want?

JULIAN

... I love violence.

CHANG

You want to fight me?

JULIAN

Thai style.

CUT TO:

KIM

(IN THAI)

What about his brain?

PHAIBUN

(IN THAI)

It's a risk... One hit in the wrong place

and he'll be straight back in hospital.

And maybe he wont be so lucky as last

time.

DAENG

(IN THAI)

Then why's he going to fight the

Westerner?

PHAIBUN

He used to be a great boxer.

KIM

He has to do it. Since he came out of

the coma, that's what he's done.

Whatever's been asked of him, he's done

it. He can't help it. It's all a

mystery...

DAENG

And if he loses?

PHAIBUN

He can't lose. He's the Angel of

Vengeance.

CUT TO:

CHANG

View.

NADEE

Window.

CHANG

Table.

NADEE

Do you like the table?

CHANG

Yes. I like the table.

NADEE

What is it?

CHANG

I need to speak to you in Thai.

NADEE

(IN THAI)

What is it?

CHANG

(IN THAI)

I love you.

CUT TO:

MAI

What is it?

JULIAN

You can't wear that.

MAI

Why not?

JULIAN

My mother's... Very particular about

colours.

MAI

You're kidding?

JULIAN

She hates red. Come on, we'll get you

something else.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

Come on.

MAI

This is insane.

JULIAN

Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this

way. Trust me.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

JENNA

So... May, isn't it?

JULIAN

It's Mai, Mum.

JENNA

How long have you two known each other

then?

JULIAN

A year and a half isn't it?

MAI

...that sounds about right.

JENNA

Well it's always a rare treat to meet

one of Julian's lady friends.

JULIAN

Mum, please...

JENNA

So, where did you two meet?

JULIAN

I saw her walking down the street.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

And I thought - this is the most

beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I

just walked up to her and started

talking.

JENNA

I hear that happens a lot in this part

of the world... Tell me, what's your

line of work, Mai?

MAI

I work in the service industry.

JENNA

I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before

you started serving my son, how many

cocks were you serving? Was it over a

thousand?

JENNA (CONT'D)

I know girls like you. Just because you

might be pulling the wool over my son's

eyes don't think it's going to work with

me.

JULIAN

Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.

JENNA

I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by

and let a dirty little hooker take

advantage of my son in the vain hope

that her womb isn't so diseased that

she can trick him into impregnating her

and putting another cocksucking child

on to this earth.

JULIAN

Leave her alone Mum. You've got her

wrong. She's a good girl.

JENNA

What do you know about what's good?

MAI

He's good to me...

JENNA

Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really

happy for you--

JULIAN

Mum!

JULIAN (CONT'D)

The cops came by my club today.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

They're investigating a murder. The

guy that killed Billy turned up dead

this morning.

JENNA

Oh really, shame that, still, live by

the sword, die by the sword...

JULIAN

I know it was you, Mum.

JENNA

I did what had to be done.

JULIAN

He was there. He was with them.

JENNA

Who?

JULIAN

The Angel of Vengeance.

JENNA

D'you kill him?

JULIAN

No.

JENNA

Cause he as good as killed Billy. What

I want to know is, what are you going

to do about it?

JULIAN

I'm not going to kill him...

JENNA

Yes you are. You're going to do it for

me and you're going to do it for your

brother.

JULIAN

This isn't about Billy. This is about

me. All my life I've been running...

JENNA

That's right you cunt, cause you always

run away whenever there's a problem...

just like you're running away from

killing this fucking Angel of whatever

-

JULIAN

- his name is Chang-

JENNA

Chang?!

MAI

I should be going now.

JENNA

Sit down you cunt.

JULIAN

Mum, don't talk to her like that.

JENNA

So what am I left with?

JULIAN

Me.

JENNA

You're right. We're family. We stick

together. But Billy was family too.

JULIAN

Billy was a fuck up... He deserved

everything he got. You know it and I

know it.

JENNA

That's it. I'm not listening to this.

I don't ever want to hear you mention

his name again... Do you hear me?

JULIAN

Yeah we were brothers, but we were never

close... And he was only in Bangkok

cause you couldn't control him. So you

sent him to me--

JULIAN (CONT'D)

-- So you sent him to me and what could

I do?

JENNA

You could have protected him.

JULIAN

I did what I could. And that's more than

you ever did.

JENNA

I would've done anything for him. Okay,

he wasn't born with as many advantages

as you were. He struggled with things.

But I always stood by him.

JULIAN

And what did that get him? I'll tell

you what, a one way ticket to this

fucking place, just like me.

JENNA

Don't you dare blame me for what

happened back then.

JULIAN

I'm only here 'cause of you. If you

didn't exist, I wouldn't be here.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

I could've been someone, Mum. I was on

my way...

JENNA

You would've been a great fighter...

You could've gone pro.

JULIAN

Don't you think I know that? And look

at me now. I'm a front for a drugs

smuggling.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

It's true... The whole thing's a front.

Every day I see kids coming in with great

potential. And every day I see kilos

of heroin going out. And it's all

because of you, Ma. You and the money

and the drugs.

JENNA

At least you're not behind bars and

that's more important to me.

JULIAN

That's right Mum. That's what's more

important to you. But what about me?

Sometimes I think you only got me out

of there so the cops couldn't trace it

back to you...

JULIAN (CONT'D)

...that's right Mum. Think about it.

With me gone you were safe. And it turned

out to be good for business as well.

All very convenient.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

Is that what happened with Billy? Did

Billy become a problem like I did?

Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big

fucking problem when he was here...

Still, at least you didn't have him

killed.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum.

Doesn't matter what you say. And do you

want to know why?

JENNA

Surprise me.

JULIAN

'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the

ring. Me versus him.

JENNA

Well that seems sensible... And what

do you hope that's going to achieve?

JULIAN

I don't expect you to understand. Cause

you don't understand anything that

isn't about you.

JENNA

And when you lose, what's going to

happen then?

JULIAN

I don't know... But maybe this time I'll

win. Like you say, only God forgives.

Maybe this time he'll forgive me...

JENNA

Do you understand what he's talking

about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking

a clue.

JULIAN

You never did, Mum.

JENNA

I hope you find what you're looking for.

'Cause if you don't, it's going to find

you and I'm not always going to be there

to look after you.

JENNA (CONT'D)

Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you

again soon.

MAI

Are you alright?

JULIAN

I'm fine.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

I'll be fine. In a minute.

JULIAN (CONT'D)

Sorry about that.

GORDON

Nice evening?

JENNA

Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you

know.

JENNA (CONT'D)

You're a piece of work, aren't you?

JENNA (CONT'D)

No fucking hanging about with you, is

there?

GORDON

Well, I don't know about that. Just been

out here a while... Know how to get

things done.

JENNA

I bet you do.

GORDON

But things are going to shit. Since

Billy died, Julian's all over the

place...

JENNA

We'll have to something about that the,

wont we? But, first things first, what

about Chang?

GORDON

Who?

JENNA

My son's guardian angel.

GORDON

He's just a retired cop...

JENNA

Good, then he won't be to hard to kill,

will he?

GORDON

It's not that simple... Is there

somewhere we can go that's a little more

private?

JENNA

What did you have in mind?

GORDON

You can't just going round killing cops

here anymore. It's not that easy.

JENNA

I didn't say it was easy. But then,

you're a resourceful man, aren't you?

GORDON

I looked into it. Chang's a hard man

to get to. None of the Thais'll go near

him...

JENNA

Well then you're going to have to find

someone who's not a fucking Thai then,

aren't you?

GORDON

There might be a way... But Julian can't

find out...

JENNA

Don't you worry about that. There are

certain things that a mother and son

shouldn't - and don't - discuss...

CUT TO:

MAI

What are you doing?

JULIAN

Seeing when it hurts.

MAI

I'm going to go.

JULIAN

Didn't you like what I got you?

MAI

It's fine, but you know... It's not my

style.

JULIAN

What do you mean?

MAI

Maybe you should give it to your mother.

JULIAN

Don't to be so hard on her. Her life

hasn't been easy.

MAI

Come on Julian. She's a fucking bitch.

JULIAN

Don't say that, okay? You don't know

what you're talking about. She'd do

anything for me.

MAI

The way she talks to you --

JULIAN

Don't go there.

MAI

What? 'Don't talk about my mother'?

Come on Julian.

MAI (CONT'D)

Why don't you fuck her instead of me?

JULIAN

You don't get to judge her. You think

she's bad? You should've met my dad.

But he's not around anymore, and do you

know why? Cause she loved me too much.

MAI

You're fucked.

JULIAN

How much do I owe you?

MAI

Fuck you.

CUT TO:

YURI KARKOV

... so why do you want to kill a

policeman? Policemen are good. They

mind their own business and keep the

streets safe. Stop people stealing my

cars...

JENNA

You really want to know?

YURI KARKOV

Yes. It may effect the price.

JENNA

He killed my son.

YURI KARKOV

Revenge. Pricey...

JENNA

This is Bangkok. Nothing's that

expensive.

YURI KARKOV

You're right. Most things are cheap in

Bangkok. Especially life... We'll take

care of this business for you. But it

won't be easy and it won't be cheap.

Tell me why not. Tell me why I shouldn't

Not good enough.

Give me a reason.

GUNMAN THREE

I'm begging you. Please--

You showed no mercy in there. Why should

Don't talk unless I ask you to.

Understood?

GUNMAN THREE

(IN THAI)

Yes. Completely understood.

CHANG

Do you have anything to say for

yourself?

I'm a salesman. Some of the things I

sell aren't exactly legal... But I'll

give you the man that hired the hit...

Good...

As for myself, I'm not scared of paying

hurt my son.

GUNMAN THREE

You see? He knows. He's got the details.

I told you he would.

CHANG

(IN THAI)

And I told you not to talk unless I asked

you.

GUNMAN THREE

(IN THAI)

Wait. You said if I took you to him you'd

let me live.

I never said that.

This him?

Skylight bar at the Jupiter.. Every

murdered today.

you dead...

Why?

DIMITRI

Said you... murdered her son....

Who was she?

DIMITRI

I don't know...

How did she know me?

DIMITRI

She asked for you by name...

CHANG

And what's my name?

DIMITRI

CHANG--

CHANG

(IN THAI)

I see the way you look at my people.

The way you abuse them with your eyes.

For this, I take your sight.

CHANG (CONT'D)

(IN THAI)

You live in my country, but you fail

to learn our language. You don't even

try. For this I take your tongue...

CHANG (CONT'D)

You had opportunities. You could have

chosen other paths... But you wouldn't

listen... For this I give you

silence...

So I'll go, but I know I'll think of

And how do you feel now?

Nothing. I don't feel anything at all.

Don't you see, that's how I felt when

Billy died...

He's going to come after me. And after

I'm scared, Julian.

JENNA (CONT'D)

What are we going to do?

JULIAN

We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take

describe" Chang said, "but I do feel

different."

CHARLIE LING (CONT'D)

metaphysical, impossible to

explain... I travelled to many places

I came here to collect my son's body.

Now it's released, my business in

KIM

When are you leaving?

JENNA

Tonight.

KIM

And your other son - is he going with

you?

JENNA

I've had no real contact with Julian

since he ran away.

KIM

You watched him fight.

JENNA

I watched him lose. And he deserved to.

You were the better fighter. My only

sadness is that Billy got caught up in

what he's doing out here. And paid for

it with his life.

JENNA (CONT'D)

I'll never testify against my own flesh

and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a

killer.

JENNA (CONT'D)

... It pains me to say it, but my own

son is a killer. He killed a cop back

in England ten years ago. He's been on

the run ever since. I say son... But

he hasn't been a son to me.

JENNA (CONT'D)

Not for a long time. Not since he killed

that cop back home... That was ten years

ago. He's been running ever since. And

he'll never stop until he's caught.

Until you catch him.

GORDON (CONT'D)

And now she wants me to take over. She
