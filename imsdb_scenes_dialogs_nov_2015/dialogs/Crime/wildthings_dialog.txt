FADE TO:

NICOLE

When we graduate the only thing I'm

going to miss is...

(with a nod to the stage)

Know what I mean?

NICOLE (CONT'D)

Kelly?

KELLY

(still staring)

Oh yeah.

SAM

We've come to the halfway point in my

senior seminars...

SAM (CONT'D)

Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?

JIMMY (O.S.)

No!

SAM

Thank you, Jimmy.

JIMMY

Hey, man, at least in study hail I could

meditate.

KIRK (O.S.)

He means masturbate...

SAM

Something Kirk with which I'm sure you

have hands-on experience.

SAM (CONT'D)

We've all heard the words, date rape,

sexual harassment.  We've talked about

some of these things in this room.

(beat)

Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay

Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray

Duquette and Gloria Perez.

(beat)

They're here to give you what we hope

will be a fresh perspective on these

subjects, and to answer any questions

you night have.

RAY

Thank you for having us.  We'll each

talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then

open it up to your questions...

SUZIE

I'm not going to listen to this

jack-off.

RAY

Let's begin with a question.  What is a

sex crime?

JIMMY

Not getting any.

CAROLE

Have a nice weekend, Mr. Lombardo.

SAM

Hey, Carole, you too.  And be good.

CAROLE

(beneath a pouty look)

I hate to be good.

SAM

This is one of the original buildings.

We have the offices here now.

GLORIA

Anybody in particular?

SAM

Sam Lombardo.  The first.  Class of

'Forty-Two

(beat)

My father.

VOICE (0.S.)

Can't seem to get rid of the Lombardos

around here.

SAM

Art.  Say hello to Detectives Perez and

Duquette.

(to the cops)

Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor.

ART

So, did you set 'em all straight on the

ugly facts of life?

SAM

I have the feeling, they got it down

already.  They're a step ahead of us,

Artie.

RAY

I've got that two o'clock in town.

GLORIA

(nodding)

Back to the land of grownups.

SAM

(to Gloria)

If old pictures interest you, come back

some time, there's quite a collection

down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a

proper tour.

GLORIA

(smiling)

I'd like that.

SAM

(loud enough to be heard

by his class)

Okay, you guys.  Good work.  Now coil

those dock lines and I'll see you all on

Monday.

JIMMY

All right.  I could party on that.

SAM

That's about all it's good for.

(beat)

That's the one to have.

SAM

The Windward Passage.  I crewed on that

one summer.

(beat)

Long time ago.

JIMMY

You know, I want to thank you for

getting me into this class...  No way was

my old man going to spring for the

fees...

SAM

Hey, you're working for it.

(beneath a laugh)

Least you're supposed to be.

VOICE (O.S.)

Can I play too?  Or is it just for boys?

KELLY

So who's washing your car this weekend,

Mr. Lombardo?

(off Sam's blank look)

The senior car wash, remember?

(beat)

Tamara's making a schedule.  She said

you bought a coupon but you're not on

anybody's list.

SAM

Well, you know.  Figured I'd buy a

Washing ticket, support the effort.

That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste

of time, don't you think?

KELLY

Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I

do it?  We're working as a team.

SAM

Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out

to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys

can wash the mud off.

KELLY

Deal.

(beat)

You know, I just looked out front.  My

ride wasn't there.  You suppose you

could give me one?

KELLY (CONT'D)

You wouldn't want me to walk, would you?

I mean like, something bad might happen.

SAM

What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?

JIMMY

(still looking at Kelly)

What?

SAM

A ride.  You want one?

JIMMY

Yeah.  But I got my bike.

SAM

We got room for one more, Suzie.  You

need a ride?

KELLY

Jesus.  Where'd she get those shoes?

Whores-4-Less?

KELLY (CONT'D)

That's cute.

KELLY (CONT'D)

(to Suzie)

I hope you swallow it.

KELLY

Don't forget the car wash.

SAM

I won't.

SANDRA

Is that Sam Lombardo?

KELLY

(sarcastic)

Hi, Mon.

SANDRA

Sam!  Hi!

SANDRA (CONT'D)

(to Sam; as if Jimmy

wasn't even there)

What?  You're going to drive off without

even saying hi?

SAM

Hi, Sandy.

SANDRA

Why don't you come in, have a drink?

SAM

Can't.  Got a passenger.

SANDRA

He can wait.

SAM

I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.

SANDRA

I'll bet.

(then, softening)

Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this

weekend.  We'll take the boat out...

SAM

(cutting her off)

Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.

SANDRA

What?  Running over alligators with that

silly swamp jalopy when you could be

sailing a real boat...

SAM

Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you

a look into the muck we all crawled out

of.  You ought to try it some time.

FADE TO:

NICOLE

This is it?

KELLY

Four-thirty-seven.

NICOLE

Nice.

KELLY

What do you want, he's a teacher for

Christ's sake.

(beat)

It's here.  Pull over.

BARBARA

(getting just a little

breathless)

Sam, come on... I'm gonna be late for my

game...

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Not that I'm going to be much good after

last night...

SAM

Eat a power bar.

GIRLS

Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

KELLY

Look, he forgot.  I knew it.

SAM

No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's

nice and dirty for you.

(beat)

But you might want to wait a minute.

The Mercedes is leaving.

NICOLE

You mean that isn't yours too?

KELLY

Where's the hose?  We can set up.

SAM

In back of the garage.

BARBARA

Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?

SAM

Kelly.

BARBARA

She's going to wash your Jeep?

SAM

Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told

'em they could hose down the Jeep.

(off Barbara's look)

Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.

BARBARA

Sam the philanthropist.

(a beat)

Tomorrow, right?

SAM

So, where you off to now?

KELLY

Aren't  you forgetting something?

(off Sam's look)

Your coupon.  We gotta have it.

SAM

Jeez, that thing... Can't you...

KELLY

(smiling)

Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

SAM

All right.  I'll have to look for it.

KELLY

(as he starts to go)

Mr. Lombardo.

(as he stops)

We're running kind of late.  How about

if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You

could give me a ride when you find the

ticket.

SAM

Give me a minute.

NICOLE

(mouthing the words)

Are you sure?

DISSOLVE TO:

SAM

Sly old fucker.  How you got so big,

wasn't it?

SAM

Barbara?

BARBARA

It's hot in here, just the way you like

it.

KELLY

Bang...

SANDRA

Goddamnit!

(she answers)

Hello.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)

Hello, this is the attendance office at

Blue Bay School.  Your son or daughter

is absent today, Monday...

SANDRA

Jesus H. Christ!

FRANKIE

What?

SAM

Counseling.

SANDRA

Sam, Sandy Van Ryan.

SAM

Sandy... What's up?

SANDRA

Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you

talked to her?

SAM

No.

SANDRA

Shit. Here we go again.

SAM

Didn't you see her this morning?

SANDRA

To tell you the truth, I haven't seen

her since Friday.

SANDRA (CONT'D)

Never mind.  I found her.

(a long beat)

Listen, Sam.  It was good seeing you the

other day.

(beat)

I haven't found anyone else can handle

the Jonathan like you can.

SANDRA (CONT'D)

Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara

Baxter.  So what?

SAM

So maybe I'm a one-woman man.

SANDRA

Right.

(beat)

You really think you're gonna get one of

these Blue Bay women to marry you?

SANDRA (CONT'D)

Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand

around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.

SAM

Goodbye, Sandra.

SANDRA

The nerve of some people.

SANDRA

You seem to find guns therapeutic.

Maybe I oughta try it.

SANDRA (CONT'D)

Let me guess, some boy didn't call and

screwed up the weekend.  So you're

taking the day off.

KELLY

Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?

SANDRA

Whichever one I want.

SANDRA

Okay, what's the matter?

KELLY

You notice my new jumper?

KELLY (CONT'D)

My friends buy me clothes, so I don't

look like trash.

SANDRA

I would hardly say you look like trash.

KELLY

No thanks to you.

SANDRA

Come off of it.

(a beat)

You run with all these little trust fund

brats... They think money grows on

trees.  It doesn't.  Believe me.  And a

lot of your little friends are gonna

learn that one the hard way.

(beat)

I'm trying to spare you that.

SANDRA (CONT'D)

Kelly.  What is it?

KELLY

I miss Dad.

SANDRA

Jesus.

(a long beat)

Well, I do too, sometimes...

KELLY

No you don't.

SANDRA

He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.

He could have gone out and gotten a job.

Christ, he could've found another rich

woman... He never had a problem tucking

my friends when we were married.

SANDRA (CONT'D)

I don't know why he did it.  I really

don't...

SANDRA (CONT'D)

Can I get you anything?

SANDRA

What, honey?  I can't hear you.

KELLY

I said.  I was raped.

SANDRA

What?

KELLY

I was raped.

(a long beat)

By Sam Lombardo.

SANDRA

He... Sam Lombardo?

KELLY

Yes.  God, Mom...

SANDRA (V.O.)

My daughter does not get raped in Blue

Bay!

RAY

(in a quiet voice)

You're saying that Kelly was raped by

Sam Lombardo.

SANDRA

That's right.

GLORIA

The guidance counselor at Blue Bay?

SANDRA

(sarcastically)

The guidance counselor at Blue Bay.

GLORIA

We understand your feelings, Ms. Van

Ryan.  But please, we'd like some time

with Kelly.  We'd like to take her

statement alone.

SANDRA

Are you okay for this?

SANDRA (CONT'D)

The man must be insane to think he can

do this to me...

GLORIA

How are you, Kelly? Would you like to

take a break for a minute?

KELLY

(shaking her head)

I just want to get it over with.  My

mom's making me do this. I just want to

forget it.

GLORIA

I know you do.

GLORIA (CCNT'D)

We'd like to videotape the statement if

that's all right with you.

GLORIA (CONT'D)

I know this is not pleasant, Kelly.  But

these are serious charges and we need to

know everything that happened between

you and Mr. Lombardo.

(beat)

Are you ready?

KELLY

He started rubbing my shoulders.  Said

must be sore after washing cars.  I...

let him  I mean he's a nice guy.

(beat)

I don't know... It was so fast.  I

closed my eyes.  I remember his hands

moved to my breasts.  I mean just for a

second it was nice... I forgot whore I

was.  I mean he's so gorgeous...

KELLY

The next thing... his hand was in my

shorts... you know, from behind.  His

fingers... his fingers...

GLORIA (O.S.)

Take your time.

KELLY

They were in me.  Both places... you

know.

GLORIA (O.S.)

I understand.

KELLY

He said something like, "Do you want it

dirty7" or something.

(beat)

I tried to turn away, but he pushed me

to the floor.

GLORIA (O.S.)

Was there penetration?  Did he put

himself inside you?

KELLY

Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean

that's how it sounded in my head.  He

hurt me...

GLORIA (O.S.)

(as Kelly breaks into

tears)

That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.

(beat)

But I have to ask you something here.

When you say it hurt.  Was this the

first time a man was inside you?

KELLY

No.  I've done it a couple of times, I

mean with guys I dated.  But this

hurt... like, he was built... you

know...

GLORIA (O.S.)

He was large?

GLORIA (O.S., CONT'D)

Did you try to fight him?

KELLY

I... he had my wrists pinned behind me.

I remember my hands were cold.'

GLORIA (O.S.)

Then what?

KELLY

He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it

happen."  Then he just stopped.

GLORIA (O.S.)

You mean he withdrew...

KELLY

Not at first.  He was still inside but

he wasn't moving or anything...  He said

we had this secret.  And that now he'd

be able to help me... because we were

close... Something like that.  I don't

know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.

GLORIA (O.S.)

Try, Kelly.

KELLY

I know one thing he said.  It was

when... when he took himself out and was

standing up.

(beat)

He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come."

I can't forget that.  He said, "No

little girl can ever make me come."

HUNTER

"No little girl can ever make me come."

Jesus.  Too bad.  We might have some

physical evidence.

GLORIA

I don't know.  It feels wrong.

HUNTER

Why?

GLORIA

I think she's acting.  I think she set

it up to be alone with him because she

wanted him to come on to her.

(beat)

I think maybe she's upset that he

didn't...

RAY

Or maybe she thought that was what she

wanted and she got a little more than

she bargained for...

HUNTER

The line I get on this guy, is that he's

done half the women in Blue Bay.

GLORIA

That doesn't make him a child rapist.

(beat)

There's something else.  This girl's had

some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her

mom's cars.  Ran away...

HUNTER

Where's this coming from?

GLORIA

I worked Juvenile in Dade County for

three years.  We had a missing persons

on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe

a year ago... The family kept it out of

the papers.

RAY

That would make it about the time of her

old man's suicide.  You don't think that

could explain some erratic behavior?

GLORIA

All I'm saying is, I think we should go

slow here.

HUNTER

I want a full-scale investigation.

GLORIA

You know what that will mean for

Lombardo.

HUNTER

I don't care.  You heard that girl's

statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me

a case.

GLORIA

Well you were a big help.  You know

what's going to happen if we go

full-bore on this.

RAY

It's our job, Gloria.

GLORIA

Hunter's making it our job because

Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass.

You know that as well as I do.

(beat)

We're gonna trash this guy's life and I

keep asking myself if it's really

necessary.

RAY (0.S.)

Yeah, well, maybe you're wrong about

him.  Maybe he's got it coming.

SAM

That's good, Jimbo.  I'll see you on

Monday.

SAM (CONT'D)

(to Art, nodding after

Jimmy)

What's left of my sailing class.

SAM (CONT'D)

Talk to me Artie.

ART

Kelly Van Ryan...

SAM

... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told

me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...

ART

Sam... I...

(a long beat)

Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with

every member of the school board all day

long.  She's pushing for suspension...

SAM

This is insane.

ART

All I can tell you Sam, is hang in

there.  They clear you of this mess, you

get reinstated, with back pay...

SAM

That's great.  I'll just tell my

creditors I'm not a rapist.  No

problem... Shit.

(beat)

I can't believe the board's going to act

without even hearing my side of it.

ART

The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay.

They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan

calls up the board and says kiss my ass,

they say, left, right, or in the middle.

(beat)

You're gonna need some help on this one,

Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and

he'd better be a good one.

SECRETARY

Mr. Bowden will see you now.

KEN

Sam, hey, it's been a while.

(beat)

Looked for you at the ten year reunion.

You missed out.  Three days at the

Disneyworld Hotel... Partied ourselves

silly.

KEN (CONT'D)

Couple of your old flames were there.

You remember Jill, with the knockers.

KEN (CONT'D)

Blew up like the Goodyear blimp.

KEN (CONT'D)

But check this...

SAM

(interrupting)

Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an

attorney and you're the only one I know.

So I figured I'd start here.

KEN

Well, I'm glad you did.  And I'm sorry.

(folding his hands before

him)

Why don't you tell me about it.

SAM

What did you do to your neck?

KEN

Oh this... chiropractor did a number on

me.

KEN (CONT'D)

I don't really have to wear the thing

all the time.

(beat)

A guy from the insurance was here.

KEN (CONT'D)

Go ahead, Sam.  Shoot.  Let's see what

we've got here.

SAM

Georgie, hey.  I'm meeting Barbara.  She

here yet?

GEORGE

Mr. Lombardo.

BAXTER

This is not appropriate Lombardo.

SAM

Barbara...

BAZTER

You're finished in Blue Bay, Lombardo.

You've been scratching at the door long

enough...

(as Sam faces him)

I ever see you around my daughter,

you're going to be finished, period.

BARMAID

Sam, honey... Haven't seen you in a

while.  How's life treatin' you?

(off Sam's look)

That bad, huh?  Well, you came to the

right place.

MAN'S VOICE

Are you all right?

SAM

Yeah, I'm okay.

FRANKIE

That's too bad.

KEN

I figured, you know, it would be darker

in here.

SAM

Good thinking.

KEN

You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van

Ryan...

SAM

Forget it.

KEN

Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all

I'm saying.

SAM

I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I

thought I might be able to save my

fucking house with an equity loan.

Guess who's on the board of directors at

the bank?

SAM (CONT'D)

Can't you take that stupid thing off?

KEN

Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here

for lunch sometimes.

KEN (CONT'D)

You're not in bad shape, really.  I know

you think you are, but you're not.  Let

me tell you why.

(beat)

Sandra Van Ryan.

SAM

What's that supposed to mean?

KEN

For you to be getting this kind of heat,

for what they have on you... It doesn't

add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em

running scared.

(beat)

And I'll tell you something else, you

rush, you get careless.

SAM

Nellie Gail Ranch...

KEN

Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab

farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went

when her morn fished her out of the

swamp.

(beat)

Meanwhile, you get educator of the year

I mean there's no way they can put

this thing in front of a jury.

(beat)

Shit, they haven't even taken your

statement yet.  Reason?  They're still

shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're

coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.

SAM

There's nothing for them to get.

KEN

Good.  So what we're going to do is

march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're

going to insist they take a statement.

We're going to tell them to charge your

ass or get off your back.

(beat)

They're walking a fine line here.

Defamation of character, malicious

prosecution...

SAM

I just want my life back...

KEN

Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.

RAY

Why don't you tell us one more time, how

Kelly came to be with you, alone in your

house.

SAM

(with growing impatience)

Story's the same, Detective...

SAM (CONT'D)

I had to go look for this coupon.

RAY

The one you bought at school.

SAM

(nodding)

Like I said, I hadn't really expected to

use it.

(beat)

Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I

hear a car.  I look out the window.  I

see Nicole driving away.  I leave my

room, and there's Kelly.

RAY

In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.

SAM

Yes.

RAY

And she wanted to talk.

SAM

Yes.

RAY

But you can't tell us what she wanted to

talk about.

SAM

I could, but it's confidential.  Look,

the point is, we didn't talk.  I told

her this was not an appropriate time or

place.

RAY

And she began to cry.  And you put an

arm around her.

SAM

Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the

door.  I told her we would talk on

Monday, in the office.

GLORIA

And when you turned her toward the door,

where did you expect her to go, without

a car?

SAM

Again.  I think we covered this.  I told

her I was going to call a cab.

RAY

But she ran away.

SAM

That's right.

GLORIA

Did you call anyone?  Did you call her

house to see if she got home?  Did you

call the Masons?

SAM

No.

GLORIA

Weren't you a little worried about

her...?

SAM

There's a strip mall not half a mile

from my house.  There's phones there.  I

cruised the place, but I didn't see her.

I figured she was probably there but

that she was angry and didn't want to be

found.  I don't know... Maybe I should

have called.  But it's not like Kelly

can't take care of herself.  I figured

we'd just take it up on Monday, in the

office.

RAY

But you do admit to touching her, to

putting your arm around her.  Isn't that

against the rules?

SAM

It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...

(beat)

But, I mean... there's this kid standing

in front of you crying...

RAY

With a thirty-five inch bustline in a

wet T-shirt with no bra...

SAM

Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta

here.

RAY

Sit down, Lombardo.

KEN

All right, all right... Enough.

KEN (CONT'D)

We came down here to make a statement.

We've made it.

(beat)

If you're going to charge my client, do

it now.

KEN

I didn't think so.

(to Sam)

Let's go.

SAM

I've spent the last ten years of my life

working with kids.  I love what I do,

and I think I'm good at it.

(beat)

These kids trust me, and there is no

way.  No way in hell I would ever betray

that trust.

HUNTER

Nice speech.  Either of you buying?

RAY

Not that stuff about her running away,

him trying to find her.  That's

bullshit.

HUNTER

What about witnesses?

RAY

We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard,

couple of kids playing hoops.

HUNTER

And what do they say?

GLORIA

Same as him.  They saw her come.  They

saw her go.  They saw him follow.

RAY

Still doesn't explain why he couldn't

catch up with her.  I mean how long does

it take to put on a shirt?

COP

Phone, Bryce.  It's Sandra Van Ryan.

HUNTER

Christ Almighty.  That woman's calling

me six times a day.

HUNTER (CONT'D)

I think you're onto something, Ray.

Stay with it.

GLORIA

We failed to mention the mower guy's a

drunk, that he was after more beer and

never really saw Kelly go into the

house, so he can't say how long she was

in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw

her running down the street, but that's

it.

(beat)

With no physical evidence, what do we

have?  Her word against his.

RAY

You're telling me you believe the guy?

GLORIA

All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van

Ryan push us too hard, we're going to

wind up looking stupid.

RAY

I'd better return this.

RAY

(off Gloria's look)

Seen any good gator wrestling lately?

GLORIA

They say it was old man Van Ryan planted

the melalucas to dry up the swamp.

GLORIA (CONT'D)

You can go up to one of those trees and

peel the bark.  You know what you get?

More bark.  And more bark.  There's no

core.  Tree's not good tar anything but

sucking up water.  And now they can't

get rid of them.  They've tried poisons.

Nothing works.  They don't die.

RAY

Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't

imagine he gives a shit now.

GLORIA

You're sure we're not lost?

RAY

You remember that little girl walked out

of our talk at Blue Bay?

GLORIA

The skinny brunette.

RAY

This is where she lives.  She wants to

talk.

(beat)

Beats the shit out of me why she would

call me at all.  I busted her once for

possession.  she wound up doing about

six months at Camp Nine.

GLORIA

You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.

GLORIA (CONT'D)

That's what they called it when I was in

Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.

RAY

It's a shithole.  But she was dirty,

what was I gonna do?

VOICE (0.5.)

He's just showin' off for you now.

RAY

Evening Ruby.

(beat)

I see you still got Walter.  I was sort

of hoping something had eaten him by

now.

RUBY

(a long beat)

Can I help you with something?

RAY

Suzie called.  You know where we can

find her?

RUBY

You know the way.

RUBY (CONT'D)

You won't shoot her will you?  I don't

believe she's armed.

SUZIE

Jesus.  It took you long enough.  What

if somebody was trying to strangle me?

Or fuck me in the ass, even?

(beat)

I mean, you guys are Sex Crimes.

RAY

Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.

SUZIE

I did.  At Blue Balls.

GLORIA

Seems to me you left early, before we

could meet.  But hi, Suzie.

SUZIE

It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a

pretty good line on what cheap fucks

people are.

RAY

So Suzie, you called us, remember?

SUZIE

Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

RAY

No.

SUZIE

Will they?

RAY

It doesn't look like it.

SUZIE

Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?

GLORIA

That bothers you?

SUZIE

(a long beat)

Yeah, maybe, a little.

GLORIA

Why is that?

GLORIA (CONT'D)

You can talk to us, Suzie.  That's why

we're here...

GLORIA

Okay, Suzie.  We want you to tell us

about the day Mr. Lombardo gave you and

Jimmy a ride.

Suzie stares at the three cops around her, then at the camera.

SUZIE

You didn't tell me you were gonna put me

on the fucking news.

GLORIA

We need to tape the interview, Suzie.

No one will see it but us.

(beat)

Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo

gave you the ride?

SUZIE

About a year ago.

GLORIA

He dropped Jimmy off first?

SUZIE

Yeah.

GLORIA

And when he arrived at your house, was

anyone there?

SUZIE

No.

GLORIA

So you were alone.

SUZIE

Yes.

GLORIA

Did he come in with you?

SUZIE

I guess.

HUNTER

You guess?  Did he or didn't he?

SUZIE

Yeah... okay... he did

HUNTER

And then what... he touched you?  Did

you maybe flirt a little...

SUZIE

I wanna go home now.

GLORIA

Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.  I

know it's harder to talk here than in

your room, but we need to get it on

tape.

(beat)

Just tell us what you told us before.

Tell us the truth.

SUZIE

I didn't say a thing to him.  He just

put his arm around me.  Told me I was

pretty... I could be really pretty, he

said.

Another moment -- she looks at Ray, then at Hunter.

HUNTER

What did you do then?

SUZIE

(a long beat)

Shit, what difference does it make...

Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...

HUNTER

Suzie!  Did this man rape you?

SUZIE

Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the

floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I

go home?

GLORIA

At that point were you able to fight him

off?

SUZIE

No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay?

That's all.  Let me go.

SUZIE (CONT'D)

Don't touch me.

SUZIE (CONT'D)

He did say something.

GLORIA

What was that?

SUZIE

He said, "No little bitch can ever make

me come."

PRISONER

So you're the new chicken licker.

CUT TO:

CYNTHIA (TV)

Today from Superior Court in Miami,

Florida -- Dade County versus Samuel J.

Lonbardo.

CYNTHIA (TV, CONT'D)

The Lonbardo rape case has galvanized

the upscale town of Blue Bay...

CYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D)

... with its tabloid appeal -- Sandra

Van Ryan -- jet-set real estate

heiress...

CYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D)

The powerful Blue Bay elite...

CYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D)

... the girl from the wrong side of the

tracks...

CYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D)

In the end, the prosecution's case will

come down to...

HUNTER

... what happened to Kelly Lanier Van

Ryan and Susan Marie Toller that will

forever change the lives of these two

young women?  What happened in those

fifteen minutes alone with Samuel

Lombardo?

HUNTER

Do you need more time?

HUNTER (CONT'D)

I know this is hard, Kelly, but I have

just one more question and even though

its something we've been over, I want us

all to be very clear about it.

(a long beat)

When you made the decision to stay at

Mr. Lombardo's house, after he had

offered you a ride.  When you saw that

he intended to have sex with you, what

were your exact words?  What did you

say?

KELLY

I told him, no.  I said stop, Mr.

Lombardo, please... I screamed for him

to stop...

HUNTER

And did he?

KELLY

No.  He raped me on the floor of his

shitty house.

CUT TO:

GLORIA

You've got nothing to be scared of,

Suzie, just take a deep breath.

SUZIE

He pushed into me... I couldn't stop

him... it hurt.

HUNTER

I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?

SUZIE

Because... it was the biggest I've ever

seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way

through Jack's Fish Camp.

HUNTER

Ms. Toller, did Samuel Lombardo rape you

in your family's home on the 23rd of

April last year?

HUNTER (CONT'D)

Ms. Toller?

SUZIE

I said he did.

HUNTER

Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under

oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?

SUZIE

This wasn't my idea.

HUNTER

I'm sorry?

SUZIE

Look.  I just don't want to get into any

more trouble...

JUDGE

(to Baxter)

The Court would like to hear what Miss

Toller has to say.

(to Suzie)

Miss Toller.

SUZIE

Mr. Lombardo didn't rape me.  He didn't

rape Kelly either.  He didn't do

anything.

JIMMY

I don't believe it...

HUNTER

Your Honor... I must object...

JUDGE

(hammering for order)

I think I made it plain that the Court

intends to near Miss Toller's story.

SUZIE

I'm sorry.

JUDGE

Sorry?  Just how far did you intend to

let this go?

SUZIE

I don't know.  I just wanted to hurt Mr.

Lombardo.

SUZIE (CONT'D)

He was my friend at first.  Then I got

busted... he didn't even stick up for

me.  I had to go away to that hellhole.

It's like, you're his favorite, then who

cares?  You wanna know something?  When

Kelly said we should do this, I thought

cool, all these big shots screwing me

over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now

they're gonna get screwed.

HUNTER

Your Honor... Please...

JUDGE

Any more interruptions Mr. Hunter, and

the Court will hold you in contempt.

(to Suzie)

What you are telling me, Ms. Toller, is

that Kelly Van Ryan is responsible for

conceiving this entire charade...

SUZIE

Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo, too.

She's in love with him.  I mean her

whole fantasy is him since her old man

died.  Then she found out that Mr.

Lombardo was doing her mom.  I mean that

was it...

KELLY

You stupid little bitch...

SAM

I've found that adolescents make the

best liars.  They're old enough to be

good at it, but you want like hell to

believe them, because they're still

children.

KEN

(hyped)

Come on, let loose!

SAM

I was just thinking about where I'm

gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's

like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.

KEN

You'll get over it. We've got a

knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a

lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.

SAM

Just like that?

KEN

Just like that?  These people ruined

your life, bro.

KEN (CONT'D)

I told you they were going overboard and

they did... They'll settle.  Believe me.

They'll be begging to settle...

SAM

You don't think you're overdoing it?

SANDRA

I hope you're going to nail his scrotum

to the nearest wall.

BAXTER

That might have been a possibility, if

little miss not-so-bright here hadn't

started throwing things.

KELLY

Fuck off.

Sandra lunges to slap Kelly.  Baxter stops it in midair.

BAXTER

See what I mean...

SANDRA

You're going to let them get away with

this... this shit?  On the word of one

little white trash bitch...

BAXTER

You like seeing your name in the papers?

BAXTER (CONT'D)

Leave town, Sandy.  Go to your place in

St. Barts.  Let things cool down.

BAXTER (CONT'D)

They'll try for twenty million.  The

cheaper the lawyer, the higher the

demand.

SANDRA

You've got to be kidding.

HAXTER

The man's life has been destroyed.

There will always be doubters, no matter

what happened in court.

SANDRA

I'm not paying any idiot twenty million

dollars.

BAXTER

I said that's what they'd ask for.

SANDRA

I hope you're happy.

KELLY

Ecstatic.

DISSOLVE TO:

KEN

Tom Baxter.  Good to see you again.

BAXTER

Let's cut the crap.  What does your

client want?

KEN

Besides an apology?

BAXTER

Unless you're planning on leaving Blue

Bay, there's gonna be other cases, other

days... You might want to keep that in

mind.

KEN

Okay Tom.  My client wants your client

to saddle up... so we can ride her ass

all the way to the bank.

SAM

Lizards don't seem to miss me.

SAM (CONT'D)

How you doing, Artie?

ART

I... You know... I...

SAM

Take care of my lizards, Art.

SAM

Kelly...

KELLY

Drop dead... You know where my mom is

trying to get the money to pay you off?

She's trying to break my trust.  How do

you like that?  I can't touch it until

she's dead and she won't give me a dime

and now she's trying to break it to pay

you...

SAM

Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what

you've been through... I should've seen

something like this coning.

KELLY

Why don't you start fucking her again.

You can spend it together.

KELLY (CONT'D)

I hate you!

SAM

You see.  I couldn't stay, even if I

wanted to.

FRANKIE

I'll be seeing you.

KEN

So long, Tom.  Come by sometime.  We'll

have lunch at the Beef Bowl.

BAXTER

I don't think you're gonna be eating at

the Beef Bowl anymore, kid.

SAM

Thanks Ken, you did okay.

KEN

(no clowning now)

Look, I know there's a part of you

wishes none of this had happened.  But

it did.  Now take the money and get out

of here.  Find a happy place.

DISSOLVE TO:

SAM

Damn maid.

SAM

Ahhhh!

SAM

Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

KELLY

So you got my mom's money.

KELLY (CONT'D)

How much?

KELLY (CONT'D)

How much?

SAM

About six and a half million dollars.

KELLY

Your turn to pay.

KELLY (CONT'D)

King Dong!  That's you, Sam!

KELLY (CONT'D)

It worked!  We screwed the bitch!

KELLY CCONT'D)

It worked just like you said it would.

SAM

God, you scared the shit out of me.  You

must be crazy coming here.

KELLY

Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.

SUZIE

How much is about six and a half million

divided by three?

SAM

Jesus.  Two million one hundred

thirty-three thousand three hundred

thirty-three and change.

SAM (CONT'D)

Now calm down.  Both of you.

SAM (CONT'D)

From now on, if we're seen together,

it's got to be accidental.  I thought

that was understood...

KELLY

Hey, come on... We've got to have at

least one victory party.

SAM

Kelly, for christ's sake...

SAM (CONT'D)

The only way we're gonna blow this now,

is if we do it ourselves...

KELLY

(her hand in his crotch)

Do it to ourselves?

SAM

(weakening)

We have to stick with the plan.

KELLY

Stick?

FADE TO:

RAY

You saw the news today?

GLORIA

Lombardo's settlement?

GLORIA (CONT'D)

Yeah, well, I told you they were gonna

make us look stupid.

RAY

Hey, don't back away from it, you were

right.  We did look stupid.

(beat)

What you were wrong about, is who made

us look that way.

RAY (CONT'D)

Think back, before the suit was filed,

before the trial.  Lombardo had an

affair with Sandra, right?

(Gloria nods)

So why not tell us about the affair?  I

mean it could be a hell of a motive for

Kelly to fabricate her charge in the

first place.

GLORIA

Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the

affair for the trial.

RAY

I thought of that.  Then I said, come

on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is

getting trashed.  You want to stop the

bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail

for three months.  Unless...

GLORIA

Unless what?

RAY

Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan

for the big payday.

RAY (CONT'D)

They chumped us, Gloria, right from the

start.

GLORIA

Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty

good already, nice job in a beautiful

setting, popular, an active social life.

(beat)

He's gonna put this all on the line for

some dicey play like what you're

describing...

RAY

(interrupting)

The job looks okay to us.  But look at

it from his point of view.  The man's

surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But

for him... it's just a reminder of what

should have been his.

RAY (CONT'D)

Your old man graduates from Blue Bay

School, you're not supposed to wind up

there.  Board of Directors maybe, but

not in the lousy guidance office.  Now.

Point number two.

(he taps at the printout

on his desk)

I've run a financial on Lombardo.  Guy

was eyeball-deep in debt before this all

happened -- trying to keep up with

pricey trim like Barbara Baxter.

GLORIA

So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor,

but why would Kelly have to steal from

her own mother?  Surely her father...

RAY

(interrupting)

Her father didn't leave her squat.  The

kid's got money in trust from her

grandfather, but she can't touch that

till her mother dies and Sandra seems to

have the idea that Kelly ought to learn

the value of a buck.

GLORIA

This one's got you working overtime,

hasn't it?

RAY

I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's

dirty.  And I'll tell you something

else.  You want to know how old man

Lombardo lost his money?

(beat)

He was fucked out of it by old man Van

Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt

Creek Land Deal.

(beat)

It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a

corporation to develop swamp land, got

investors like Lombardo to put up money,

then turned around and got the state to

declare the area an ecological preserve,

on the sly, of course, but everyone knew

it was him.  The freeway went to the

coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.

GLORIA

Eliminate the competition.

RAY

You got it.  The rich got richer.  While

the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in

the swamp.

GLORIA

Where'd you come up with this stuff,

anyway?

RAY

(a long beat; then

beneath a smile)

I net a guy in a bar.

RAY (O.S.)

Nice stroke.

KELLY

Is there some reason why you're here?

RAY

Curiosity, I guess.

KELLY

About what?  How to improve your breast

stroke?

RAY

Actually, I was curious about how you

see things working out, for you, Sam and

Suzie.

KELLY

Excuse me?

RAY

You all gonna go down to the Caribbean

together?

RAY (CONT'D)

The thing about it is, threesomes so

rarely work out.

KELLY

You're out of your mind.

RAY

I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.

(beat)

It's hard enough for one person to keep

a secret, let alone three.  And then

there's the love angle.  I mean do you

and Sam really want that little

pill-head around, now that you have the

money?

RAY (CONT'D)

Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea

right up front, of whacking Suzie?

That's murder, Kelly.

KELLY

Police -- God -- get a life.

RAY

(loud enough to make

himself heard)

You're good.  But you don't think that

little ditz Suzie's gonna hold together,

do you?

SUZIE

You don't know Duquette.  I'm the one he

busted... He's a fucker, man... He'll

fuck us both over...

SUZIE (CONT'D)

I'm not going back to that prison.

That's what it was... a fucking hell

hole...

KELLY

Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna

come to you just like he did to me.

You're gonna have to be ready for him.

SUZIE

Yeah, but he can't push you around like

he can me.  You've got family and

they've got clout.  With we it's

different... with me...

KELLY

(circling her with her

arm)

Yeah, I've got family and they've got

clout and now you have me.  Right?  And

Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's

not going to send you anywhere.  He's

gonna try and rattle your cage, and

that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do

shit.

SUZIE

(a long beat)

Man, I wanna smoke a joint.

VOICE (0.S.)

'Evening, Suzie.  How was school today?

RAY

You ought to watch it with that shit,

Suzie.  You get busted again, you go

back in a two-tine loser.

SUZIE

You got something against cigarettes?

RAY

Yeah, they're bad for your health.

(beat)

I'm tryin' to look out for you...

SUZIE

That's cop bullshit.

RAY

Well, you're half right.  Best thing you

could do for yourself right now would be

to talk to me.

SUZIE

About what?

RAY

Every triangle I've ever seen never

lasts.  Somebody's got to go.

SUZIE

Is this supposed to mean something to

me?  What triangle?

RAY

You, Kelly, Sam.

SUZIE

I don't have to listen to this.  And you

can't shove me around.  I have friends

now...

RAY

Is that what you think?  You have

friends?  Is that what they told you?

SUZIE

I don't mean who you're thinking.  I

have other friends...

RAY

Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're

talking to.  We both know you don't have

shit, never have had shit, never will

have shit...

RAY (CONT'D)

Here, Suzie.  I want you :o look this

over.  Know what it is?

(as Suzie takes it)

Sam deposited his check, transferred the

funds to an offshore bank, a numbered

account.  Not even the cops can find out

whose names are on it.  Think one of

them's yours?

RAY (CONT'D)

He also put a down on some island

property, and a lease-to-buy on a

forty-foot sailboat.  You're into

sailing, aren't you, Suzie?

SUZIE

Get away from me.

RAY

Don't you see what this means?  You

really think Sam and Kelly are gonna

give you a third of the money?  You, the

pill-head with the rap sheet?

SUZIE

Shut up.

RAY

You know, I don't think I ever told you

I was sorry about your little friend...

What was his name?

RAY (CONT'D)

Come on, Suzie, help me out here.  You

know his name.

SUZIE

Davy.

RAY

(nodding, a scary smile)

That's right.  That was his name.

RAY (CONT'D)

Sometimes I wonder if you're really as

dumb as you pretend to be.

RAY (CONT'D)

But you know what?  I'd be keeping a

clear mind right now if I were you.

(beat)

I'd hate to see you come to a bad end.

Like Davy did.

SAM (V.0.)

(answering machine)

This is Sam.  I'm not in right now...

KELLY

I can't believe you called Sam.  What's

the matter with you?

SUZIE

I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared

there's no one to trust.

KELLY

You can trust me.

SAM

Kelly.  Is Suzie there?

KELLY (V.O.)

Yes.

SAM

Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left

this garbled message on my machine.

(beat)

Can you calm her down?

KELLY (V.0.)

Why can't you come...

SAM

No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm

counting on you.  You calm her down.

I mean do whatever you have to, whatever

it takes...

KELLY (V.O.)

You know what it takes.

SAM

Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly.

Do it tonight.  We'll figure something

out... Okay?

KELLY

Yeah, right.  Can you at least talk to

her, on the phone?

SUZIE (V.O.)

Sam...

SAM

Put Kelly on too.

KELLY

I'm here.

SAM

Okay.  I want you to hear this too.

We've got to be cool.  All of us.

People think I'm rich, for Christ's

sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.

(beat)

I'm spending my money.  It's more

suspicious if I sit around doing

nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck

with your minds.

SUZIE

But I..

SAM (V.0.)

Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only

people who can blow this is us.

Remember?

KELLY

Right.

SUZIE

Yeah, right.

SAM (V.0.)

Good.  Just keep telling yourselves

that, the only people who can fuck this

up is us.

SUZIE

You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?

KELLY

Oh, for Christ's sake.

SUZIE

You are.

KELLY

Are you retarded, or just brain dead

from whiffin' fumes out there in the

swamp...

SUZIE

That's what I am to you, isn't it?

Swamp trash.  It's what I am to

everybody, just like my mom...

KELLY

Stupid bitch.

KELLY

Why do you make me hurt you?  It's like

you want it or something.

KELLY (CONT'D)

God, you are scared, aren't you?

KELLY (CONT'D)

And this is going to make you feel

better, make you trust me...

CUT TO:

HUNTER

Are you crazy, Ray?

RAY

You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was

Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the

girls...

HUNTER

Ray.  The conversation on this tape is

totally unintelligible.

(beat)

What we have here, is you on the Van

Ryan property, without a proper warrant,

shooting a porn flick...

RAY

I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A

month ago you were pulling these two

apart at the courthouse.

(beat)

They were acting.  They were all acting,

from the beginning.  And we bought it,

hook, line and sinker... And now they're

home free with six million of Sandra Van

Ryan's money.

GLORIA

Which she might have saved, if she

hadn't set out to destroy the man's

life.

RAY

(turning now on Gloria)

What?  You wouldn't go after some guy

you thought raped your daughter?

(beat)

Cone on.  She bought the same story we

did...

HUNTER

Listen, both of you.  You're not on a

case.  There is no fucking case.

(beat)

I've had it up to here with Sandra Van

Ryan.  Ray, you keep mucking around like

this and you are going to have her suing

us for invasion of privacy.  Get out of

these people's lives.

(beat)

Am I getting through on this?

HUNTER

Oh, Ray... no...

RAY

You think this is just about money,

about us looking foolish?  Question him.

You're gonna find a stone cold

manipulative psychopath.  And those

girls are going to wind up dead...

HUNTER

Mr. Lombardo, please.  I'm sorry about

this.

SAM

Give this idiot something to do.  Let

him look into the Kennedy assassination.

SAM (CCNT'D)

(to Hunter)

Next time this guy drags me down here,

I'll sue you.  You're goddamn lucky I

didn't sue you the first time!

RAY

Guess I kind of lost it there.

GLORIA

You could say that.

RAY

Were you ever in a situation where you

could see a thing coming and you didn't

do what you could to stop it?

GLORIA

We all have...

RAY

I mean something bad, Gloria, something

bad you saw coning, and you didn't do

anything, and then it happened.

(off Gloria's silence)

I did that once.  I don't want to do it

again.

SAM

You look pretty.

BARBARA

Thanks.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Quite a shopping spree...

BARBARA (CONT'D)

I didn't mean...

SAM

Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend

it, right?  I've always wanted to live

where I could dive for my dinner.

BARBARA

And where might that be?

SAM

I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.

BARBARA

I love Antigua.

(beat)

Maybe I'll come visit you.

SAM

I'd like that.

KELLY

Jesus.  What are you drinking?

KELLY (CONT'D)

(looking at the bottle)

Anybody ever tell you that stuff will

rot your brain?

SUZIE

What brain?

SUZIE

What are you looking at?

KELLY

(starting the car)

Nothing.

SUZIE

I thought we were goin' to a movie.

KELLY

I think we just need to get wasted.

SUZIE

I wanna live at the beach someday.

KELLY

Shit.

KELLY (CONT'D)

I left the keys.  I'll get 'em.

SUZIE

Kelly?

SUZIE (CONT'D)

Kelly?

SAM

Suzie, it's okay.  It's me.

SAM (CONT'D)

I was worried about you, Suzie.  I

decided we should all get together, one

more time, before we split up.

SUZIE

Are you mad at me?

SAM

No, no.  Look, I probably should have

told you a little more, about the part I

intended to play.

(beat)

We'll go through it all again tonight.

SAM (CONT'D)

This is a celebration Suzie, not a

suicide pact.

SAM (CONT'D)

We'll chill out first, have a drink,

watch the stars.

SAM (CONT'D)

Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the

Jeep.  Could you get it for us?

SAM (CONT'D)

Let me tell you about this boat I picked

out for us...

SAM

I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to

happen like this.  She was losing it...

KELLY

(breathless)

There was no way.  That cop would've

gotten her to tell him... everything.

She was weak and dumb...

SAM

Are you okay?

KELLY

(a long beat)

My mom would kill me if she knew I took

the Rover.

RAY

Been four-wheelin'?

KELLY

Get off my property.

RAY

I'm not on your property!

RAY

You say she didn't come back last night.

RUBY

She's been sayin' she was going to go to

L.A.  But I don't know.  I mean all her

clothes are still here.  An' she's

missin' her graduation.

(a long beat)

She should graduate.  She's a smart

girl...

RAY

May have been she just partied too

much... But we'll look into it.  We find

something, you'll be the first to know.

RAY

It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it

begins...

GLORIA

Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She

could be anywhere...

RAY

I'm gonna take you back to the office.

Will you put out a call on Suzie's car

for me?

GLORIA

You have someplace to be?

GLORIA (CONT'D)

If you want company...

RAY

Just check out the car.

BAXTER

Smile.

BAXTER (CONT'D)

That's one for the scrapbook.

KELLY

You didn't have to fly back -- from --

wherever, for me...

SANDRA

I'm here to congratulate my friends and

their children.  I'm leaving again

tonight.

KELLY

Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.

SANDRA

Where, the mall?

KELLY

A friend of mine bought a boat.

JIMMY

It's those rocks, up there.

RAY

You and Suzie used to come out here

together?

JIMMY

Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang

out here.

(beat)

You really think something bad happened

to Suzie?

RAY

(ignoring the question)

Lombardo ever come out here?

RAY (CONT'D)

I say something funny?

JIMMY

No.  But I mean... just the idea that

Mr. Lombardo would...

RAY

Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with

the kids, one of the guys...

JIMMY

Yeah, but...

RAY

I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy.

You can catch a bus up there at the lot,

okay?

RAY

People aren't always what they appear to

be, kid.  Remember it.

DISSOLVE TO:

RAY

Lonbardo and Kelly killed her here.

GLORIA

Two kids could've gotten into a fight,

lost a couple of teeth.

RAY

Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.

GLORIA

Where's the body?

RAY

The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a

swamp rat, knows the body will never be

found there.  But he's made a mistake.

GLORIA

Her grandmother said she'd been

threatening to run away.  And I found

the car at the Miami bus terminal.

RAY

You don't think Sam could've put it

there?

HUNTER

Dust it for prints.  My guess is, if

anybody murdered Suzie it was probably

that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan.

RAY

How soon can we get something?

DAVE

We can get blood type right away.

Dental records will take longer.  You

want DNA, that can take weeks.

RAY (CONT'D)

Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.

GLORIA

We don't know that, Ray...

RAY

Kelly's next, Gloria.

HUNTER

(ice cold)

Get off this Ray, now.

(beat)

If there is any evidence here, it's for

Homicide.

(turning to Dave)

You get an ID, you call me.

RAY

Will you do me one favor?

GLORIA

Ray, you heard him...

RAY

What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm

right and Hunter's wrong?

(beat)

What do you do if you see a bad thing

coming?

RAY (CONT'D)

Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need

you...

GLORIA

And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll

give this up?

RAY

If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a

promise.

DAVE (V.O.)

(speaker)

Merritt, Forensics.

RAY

The teeth doin' any talkin'?

DAVE (V.0.)

Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the

dental records will take time...

RAY

What about the blood?

DAVE (V.0.)

(a beat)

Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a

lot of other people's too...

RAY

(cutting him off)

Second you get something on those teeth,

I want it

KELLY (V.O.)

Hello?

SAM

Hello.

KELLY (V.O.)

God, I've been calling you.

KELLY

I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps

watching me.

SAM

Duquette.  Forget him...

KELLY

I can't help it.  He gives me the

creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared

of him?  She's not that way.  I think he

did something...

SAM

Yeah, he got her busted for

possession...

KELLY

I don't know... I think it was something

else... Suzie says the bust was

bullshit...

SAM

And you believe her?

KELLY

(a long beat -- a sigh)

I don't know.

(beat)

I want to see you...

SAM

Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's

valium or something.  In another week

you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're

rich.

KELLY

But what if they find out... God, they'd

put you in the gas chamber...

SAM

So if they're tapping your phone, we're

dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip

the graduation parties.  You'll never

see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.

KELLY

(beat)

Okay.  I love you too.

SAM

Isn't that against the law, peeking into

windows?

GLORIA

(a long beat)

Suzie Toller is missing.

SAM

How long?

GLORIA

She didn't cone home last night.  We

found her car at the bus terminal, but

nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.

SAM

Maybe she used another name.

GLORIA

Ray thinks she was murdered.

SAM

I don't know what to say...

GLORIA

You could tell me where you were last

night.

SAM

Goddannit... I don't have to...

SAM

Come here.  I want you to see something.

GLORIA

Looks like goodbye.

SAM

Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to

find an angry, sexually confused girl

who's made threats on her mother's life

and a female lover she'd never identify.

GLORIA

Suzie?

SAM

You're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was

killed.  I don't have to ask you who he

thinks did it, do I?

(beat)

All I'm saying is, read that, you'll

have a new perspective on things.

GLORIA

Why didn't you tell us about this before

the trial?

SAM

Then -- I still had ethical standards to

protect.  They meant a lot to me.  Now,

I don't care.  And no amount of money

can buy that back.

SAM (CONT'D)

My ride.  If you're not planning on

arresting me, that is.

RAY

Ray.  What's happening?

GLORIA

I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.

RAY

Where's Lombardo?

GLORIA

He's leaving the country.  And I don't

give a shit.

RAY

The blood type on the rocks matches

Suzie's.

GLORIA

It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do

it.  I'll tell you something else,

there's more to this story than you

know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think

Hunter may be on the right track...

GLORIA (CONT'D)

Ray?

(nothing but dial tone)

Shit.  Ray.

SANDRA (V.O.)

(intercom)

Who is it?

RAY

(into intercom)

Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let

me in.  Now.

RAY

Where is she?

SANDRA

Where she lives.  In the guest house.

Now will you tell me what this is about?

RAY

I'm placing your daughter under arrest.

SANDRA

You can't...

RAY

(turning, cutting her

off)

Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want

Kelly to be next, then take my advice.

Stay out of my way.

FADE TO:

RAY

I fucked up.  I lost control of the

situation, the one thing they train you

for... God, what did I do?

HUNTER (0.S.)

Just tell us what happened.

RAY

I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under

arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did

her rights.

RAY

Kelly went crazy, started screaming.  I

grabbed her, put her on the floor.

HUNTER (O.S.)

She bit you?

RAY

Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned.

She calmed down.  I was going to cuff

her... She said she thought she was

going to be sick.  She asked to use the

bathroom.

RAY

I told her I was coming with her.  She

nodded, like she understood.  We stood

up together.

HUNTER (O.S.)

You didn't cuff her?

RAY

She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought,

I would just go with her, stand at the

door...

(shaking his head)

I think I looked away.  A split second.

Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts

a knee into my groin.

(beat)

There was this coffee table between us

and the wall.  She got one foot on that

thing and launched herself at the gun

case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could

hear it breaking.

(beat)

I didn't go down, but she slowed me up,

just enough.  Before I could get to her,

she'd turned on me with this small

caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put

it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it

in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice.

I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think.

In the chest.

RAY

I went there to protect her...

RAY (CONT'D)

The teeth, were they...

HUNTER (0.S.)

Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only

thing saving your sorry ass.

CHIEF

Detective Duquette; our investigation

concludes that this was a good shooting.

But that's irrelevant.  You were not

assigned to this case -- whatever you

imagined this case to be.  And now two

young women are dead.  You are

terminated with forfeiture of pension

and benefits.

HUNTER

Suzie Toller's teeth and blood were

found near the area known as Stoner

Rocks.  Suzie's blood was found in the

Van Ryan Range Rover.  This, in

conjunction with evidence obtained by

Detectives Duquette and Perez has led

this office to the conclusion that Susan

Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly

Lanier Van Ryan...

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

RAY

Buy you a drink?

SAM

Jesus.  I wasn't expecting you 'til

tomorrow.

RAY

Nice girlfriend you had there.

SAM

Yeah, well, you fixed that.

(beat)

What the hell happened, anyway?

RAY

The bitch shot me, is what happened.

RAY (CCNT'D)

Hey, what did you want me to do, die?

SAM

Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't

teach you to disarm people, shoot them

in the leg or something?  You weren't

supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.

RAY

Did you become squeamish about these

things before or after you bludgeoned

little Suzie Toller to death with a wine

bottle?

(off Sam's silence)

Jesus, man.

It couldn't have worked out better.

They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie.

I can't talk 'em out of it.

(beat)

We should be celebrating.  This thing

worked out just like you said, only

better.

SAM

Kelly was supposed to be framed, not

killed.

(beat)

What I'm telling you is, I don't like

surprises.

RAY

Every cloud has a silver lining,

partner.  Here's to no loose ends.

SAM

Here's to no more surprises.

RUBY

Gator can't see what's in front of it

for shit.  They see out the sides.

(beat)

That one don't even know Walter's arm's

in his mouth.

GLORIA

What if something distracts it and it

snaps anyway?

RUBY

Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of

his goodbye.

(loud enough for Walter

to hear)

He don't use it for no good deeds

anyway.

RUBY (CONT'D)

You come all the way out here to watch

Walter?

GLORIA

I was wondering if I could ask you a few

questions.

RUBY

About Suzie?

GLORIA

Actually, I was wondering if I might ask

you about Ray Duquette.

RUBY

(a long beat)

He used to come around here.  He had a

thing going with one of the girls over

at the Glades.

RUBY (CONT'D)

Got sort of hung up on her, from what

hear.

GLORIA

She still work there?

RUBY

No.  Not after that night.

(a long beat)

I don't know what happened.  Maybe he

caught her with some john...

All I know is, the next morning the girl

was gone and there was a dead boy...

Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live

down the road there in a wrecked car.

Him and Suzie were at the Glades that

night.

(beat)

It was right after that, Ray got Suzie

busted and sent her away.  That's what

there is to say about Ray Duquette.

GLORIA

Was there ever any kind of

investigation...

RUBY

Duquette always claimed the kid was

dusted, came after him with a knife.

But it was Jack's Fish Camp... This

could be the moon for all most people

care.

(a long beat)

Wasn't supposed to be like that though.

This place was supposed to be something

once.  There were going to be roads and

houses.  There was going to be a town.

They were going to call it Salt Creek.

SAM

Ray... you see that winch by your head?

Take a couple of turns on it for me,

she's luffing.

RAY

You mean this thing?

SAM

Yes, we call it a winch.

(pointing at pieces of

the rigging)

And these are shrouds, and these are

stays.

RAY

I thought this was supposed to be a

vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big

power boat?

SAM

Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of

you yet.

RAY

Yeah, or get me drowned.

SAM

Jesus, man... You okay?

RAY

That how you planned it?  You take cut

Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then

dump me in the ocean...

SAM

Come off it, man... It was an accident.

RAY

You... You're...

RAY (CONT'D)

You're dead... for godsake...

SUZIE

Rumors of my demise have been greatly

exaggerated.

(to Sam)

Nice move.  Good thing I was here to

save your incompetent ass.

RAY

You... I should've killed you myself.

should never have left it up to him...

SUZIE

Shoulda, coulda, woulda...

(to Sam)

Get him in the water.

RAY

Sam, for Christ's sake...

SAM

I can't.

RAY

Sam, for godsake.

SUZIE

Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the

numbered bank account besides yours and

Sam's?

SUZIE (CONT'D)

I like these joint survivorship

accounts.  Something unfortunate happens

to one of the signatories, the others

don't have to worry.  Are you worrying,

Ray?

SUZIE (CONT'D)

Men, use 'em abuse 'em lose 'em.

SUZIE

Feeling better?

SAM

That was about as grim as it gets.

SUZIE

The guy was history when he killed

Kelly.  You knew that.

SAM

But then you knew what he was like all

along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a

thing you had counted on...

SUZIE

But then it is better this way, don't

you think?  No loose ends.

SUZIE (CONT'D)

What?

SAM

That was the same thing Ray said.

SUZIE

Poor Ray.

(a beat)

Come on Sam, we did it.  We put the

screws to the Van Ryans.  We won.

SUZIE (CONT'D)

Talk about paranoid.  Now are you gonna

teach me to sail this big old boat or

not?

SAM

Okay.  Grab that winch there.

SAM (CONT'D)

What's wrong?

SUZIE

Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.

SAM

Okay.  Come here and take the helm.

I'll get the winch.

RUBY

You asked if Suzie knew about the Salt

Creek land deal?  Girl read every book

she could find on it, the Van Ryans too.

RUBY

Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy

the people who invested here.  He got to

be old, he and his rich cronies would

come down here, hunt and whore, act like

assholes.  One trip he showed up with

this young girl he'd picked up

somewhere, gotten her pregnant then

dumped her in the swamp.

(indicating the photo)

That came with her.

GLORIA

And the child...

RUBY

She had it, before she drank herself to

death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...

GLORIA

Suzie.

(beat)

Then you're not her grandmother...

RUBY

Raised her like she was, but no,

Walter's my only child.

(beat)

He was a good boy, till the army took

him.

GLORIA

So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half-

sisters.

RUBY

And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's

niece.

GLORIA

Thank you for talking to me, Ruby.  I am

sorry about Suzie, she...

RUBY

You okay?

GLORIA

I'm fine.  Nice TV.

RUBY

There's an old saying from the

Everglades -- virtue may be missed but

sin can't hide.

(a long beat)

Folks pay in the end.

HARD CUT TO:

SAM

You know the place I'm talking about --

the big rocks?

SUZIE

You've got the pressure too tight.

You'll crush the fucking evidence.

SAM

We gotta stop.  I'm gonna come.

KELLY

That never seemed to worry you at the

Glades.

SAM

That's not your line.

KELLY

Say you love me.

SAM

(a beat)

I love you.  Now give me the line.

KELLY

(a whiny voice)

No little girl can ever make me come.

SUZIE

Seems to like some of the same places

you do.  Funny you never met.

SAM

Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about

this, I could get busted on the spot.

SUZIE

Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like

it.  Especially the part about offing

me.

(beat)

Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a

new friend.

SAM

Buy you a drink?

SUZIE

You like bein' a caddy for rich kids'

problems?

SUZIE (CONT'D)

I've seen you out there in your old air

boat, thinking about what might have

been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you

out of it.

(beat)

What if I told you I had a way we could

get a big piece of it back?

SAM

We?

SUZIE

Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo

charm, not that you'd have to do

anything you haven't done already.

SAM

(white-faced)

How...

SUZIE

Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie

through knotholes for years.  I saw

these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.

(beat)

I can't decide which came out better,

that little straw Kelly's got up her

nose, or that vibrator you've got up her

ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

SAM

(a long beat)

I think there's some things you do, you

don't want to see yourself doing them.

KELLY

I'm running away.

SAM

(a beat)

You think that's wise?

KELLY

(sitting next to him)

Um-huh.  And guess what else?

(reaching into her bag)

I have toys.

SAM

(a long beat)

Well, Z guess one taste wouldn't hurt.

GLORIA

Selling your boat?

WALTER

This was Suzie's boat.  Guess she won't

be needin' it.

GLORIA

I wouldn't have guessed Suzie was a

sailor.

WALTER

Old lady had her tested once.  They said

her IQ was way up there, round two

hundred or some such shit.

(beat)

That girl could do just about anything,

she put her mind to it.

END
