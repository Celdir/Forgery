RUSH HOUR

Original Screenplay

by

Ross LaManna

REPORTER

(to TV CAMERA)

Eager to mend its tarnished image,

Los Angeles has really put out the

welcome mat for tomorrow's summit.

The city promises quite a party as

leaders from Japan, China, South

Korea, Australia, the U.S. and

others begin talks for the largest

free-trade treaty in history.

REPORTER (VO)

(continuing)

The one sour note is North Korea,

the only Pacific Rim country not

participating. There are rumors of

secret meetings with North Korean

representatives, but U.S. officials

insist the North must first hold

democratic elections, and halt its

nuclear weapons program -- as they

claimed to have done back in 1995.

REPORTER (VO)

(continuing)

Tensions remain high since last

year's skirmishes between North Korea

and the U.S. So any chance of the

communist North joining the Pacific

Partners seems highly unlikely.

DISSOLVE TO:

Consulate

of the

Democratic People's Republic of Korea

SAM

I can't stand it -- half an hour to

get to the stupid school every

morning... with no music...

(Korean; subtitled)

[Just our damn Nanny...]

DRIVER

(Korean)

[Stay in the car.]

FADE TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CARSON

Son of a bitch!

MIRANDA

Pete... please... we have to be up

early tomorrow. Call the police.

CARSON

Yeah, right.

CARSON

(continuing)

Shit!

MIRANDA

Not again...

WESTEC GUARD

Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On

the ground!

CARSON

Asshole was trying to boost my car!

CARSON

Mike -- call 911!

NEIGHBOR

Been trying...

(has a cordless phone)

It's busy.

(to Guards; re Carson)

He's the good guy, you schumcks.

CARSON

I hate this fuckin' town.

JOY

There are six bathrooms in this

house, Sam.

SAM

(fanning the air)

But only one with a smoking section.

AMBASSADOR HAN

(Korean)

[Go change.]

AMBASSADOR HAN

(continuing)

[You smell like a fireplace.]

MRS. HAN

It's the Governess...

(into phone)

Hello, Hilda...

GOVERNESS

(thru phone)

Mrs. Han... I am very sick today...

MRS. HAN

(into phone)

We will see you next week...

(hangs up; smiles to kids)

It appears I'll be taking you to

school.

JAVAL

Very good. You may go now...

BOBBI

(on TV)

...Good morning, Summit Day! It's

gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of

July, the Olympics and Woodstock all

rolled into one! All over town

there'll be parades, concerts,

rallies, festivals... So get out

there everyone, but plan your drive-

time accordingly! This is Bobbi

Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...

MORNING ANCHOR (VO)

(on TV)

The President is on his way...

PRESIDENT

(on TV)

...It's an honor hosting my fellow

leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol

city of the Pacific Rim...

MORNING ANCHOR

(on TV)

We'll see the menu for Mayor

Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right

after this...

MIRANDA

I was watching that.

CARSON

If I hear one more Beach Boys song,

I'll shoot myself.

CARSON

(continuing; while smiling)

I said, if we were having sex once in

a while, you wouldn't need to ride

that fucking bike every morning.

MIRANDA

(hasn't heard a thing)

Be right with you...

MIRANDA

(looks him over)

Have you gotten any sleep lately?

CARSON

(ignores the question)

Shop's gonna tow the car in --

goddamn ignition's trashed.

MIRANDA

Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.

CARSON

You ask me, those suckers are a lost

cause.

MIRANDA

It's not for you.

CARSON

You mean it's not for you.

MIRANDA

I don't chase car thieves in my

underwear. C'mon, you'd die of

boredom if we ever sold this house

and moved.

CARSON

I'd die of shock, from finding

anyone dumb enough to buy the place.

Even for what it's worth now.

MIRANDA

Lots of people bought at the top of

the market...

CARSON

That sure cheers me right up.

MIRANDA

I don't know why we even talk about

it. The city's not the problem. So

we move. It wouldn't matter. What's

that saying: "Wherever you go, there

you are."

MIRANDA

(continuing)

I hope you're current on your

tetanus booster. Was it worth it?

CARSON

One cut... two assholes in the

hospital... Yep.

CARSON

(continuing)

Well, another day of baby-sitting my

favorite bunch of people...

MIRANDA

Ask for a transfer.

CARSON

They're not gonna transfer me. You

know damn well why I was bumped down

to guard duty...

(as he's leaving)

My outstanding people skills.

CARSON

I hate this fuckin' town.

ANGRY VOICE (OS)

Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a

shit...

JOY

Can we give Lisa a ride?

LISA

Hey, Joy... Sam...

LISA

(continuing)

Excellent -- I can't hear him!

SAM

(raps on window)

The glass is an inch thick.

(points to doors, roof)

Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb-

proof.

LISA

Perfect car for L.A.

(looks back at her Dad)

Starts, too.

ROBBINS

Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually

escaped the office!

DAVE

I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em

a chance to hose out my cage.

DAVE

(continuing)

Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?

ROBBINS

Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.

SABATINI

"Chuckles," as we're inclined to

call him.

(yawns; flops in a chair)

Friggin' graveyard shift...

ROBBINS

Love to know what dope made it the

Bureau's job to give full-time

protection to foreign consulates.

(offers coffee to Dave)

Cup a mud?

DAVE

Not if you made it. Why don't you

get Sabatini to brew the java? She's

the alleged chick.

SABATINI

Blow me.

DAVE

Where's Carson?

SABATINI

On his way. Some creeps tried to rip

off his Mustang last night.

(beat; solemnly)

They cut the ragtop.

DAVE

Motherfuckers...

DAVE

(continuing)

Latest and greatest. Wireless

network link-ups.

SABATINI

Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.

ROBBINS

Me, too.

DAVE

Ingrates.

JAVAL

You see that I'm serious in my

intention, yes?

(she nods)

If you cooperate, you and your

children will be home for dinner

tonight.

COLONEL LEE

(Korean; to Ambassador Han)

[You must stay here.]

AMBASSADOR HAN

Someone took my family!

SABATINI

You got no jurisdiction outside

this property!

SABATINI

(continuing)

Shit!

(to Ambassador Han)

Yank his fuckin' leash!

AMBASSADOR HAN

My men are going!

AMBASSADOR HAN

(continuing; to Sabatini)

It's a white telephone van, driving

west on Washington Boulevard.

ROBBINS

Keys!

SABATINI

You're ridin' shotgun.

ROBBINS

Cherry?

DAVE

Under the seat.

ROBBINS

Siren?

DAVE

I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin'

hurry..!

SABATINI

Someone snatched Han's family! White

phone van, westbound on Washington!

CARSON

Give me a secure radio!

CO-WORKER

Someone's been to Nordstroms, big

time.

WALTHER

Clothes make the man.

CO-WORKER

But does the man make enough for the

clothes?

WALTHER

(smiles)

The man makes payments on his Visa.

SECRETARY

Mr. Walther... priority line!

WALTHER

(into phone)

This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl

Walther... What's the nature of your

emer --

(grimaces)

Aw, Jesus... not today...

(beat)

I'll inform channels and get a copter

in the air. For God's sake, keep it

quiet. Do what you can, but don't

endanger civilians or the family!

CARSON

(into radio)

You bet -- nice and easy.

WALTHER

(into phone)

Get the Secretary of State on the

horn.

(listens)

I know he left already. I'm familiar

with the concept of time zones. Find

his ass.

CARSON

(into radio)

Robbins, Sabatini... Chopper's on

its way.

CARSON

(into radio)

Check it out! Ahead, on the right!

SABATINI (VO)

(thru radio)

Think it's them?

CARSON

(into radio)

Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll

move up; he won't suspect a civilian

car. Stay back, then get on his ass

when I signal. We'll box him in.

CARSON

(continuing; into radio)

If the Mod Squad gets in your way,

don't be shy about getting 'em out.

SABATINI (VO)

(thru radio)

Copy that one.

SABATINI

Don't puke... I hate when guys puke!

JAVAL

I need to concentrate!

CARSON

(into radio)

He's gonna wrap it around something!

CARSON (OS)

Oh, shit...

COLONEL LEE

You should not have interfered!

CARSON

I'm in no mood...

ROBBINS

Forget about him!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CARSON

Let's get back to the Consulate.

DISSOLVE TO:

JAVAL

Does anyone need to use the rest

room? This will be your last

opportunity for a few hours.

(no takers)

Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy,

please sit here.

(indicates the Lazy Boys;

then turns to Lisa)

And you... what is your name?

LISA

(after a beat)

Lisa...

JAVAL

No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.

JAVAL

(continuing; sotto)

You afford me some additional

bargaining power. But not much.

JAVAL

(continuing)

There. No taping your mouths, no

restraints. Please remain still

while I explain. The meters on the

left indicate sound pressure --

Decibels. There are microphones on

your chair backs. If you raise your

voices above certain level, putting

your meter in the red zone for more

than one sustained second, the

circuit will be closed.

(beat)

The right meters indicate motion.

There are pressure sensors inside the

armrests and seats. The sensors don't

like to get wet, so I hope you were

honest about not needing to use the

loo. If you make any excess

movements, or try to leave your

chair, the circuit will be closed.

MRS. HAN

I don't understand...

MRS. HAN

(continuing; softly)

What happens if the circuit closes?

JAVAL

Kaboom...

JAVAL

(continuing)

Easy... deep breath...

(to the kids)

Do each of you understand?

JAVAL

(continuing)

Keep your wits, and all will be fine.

COMMENTATOR #1

(on TV)

...Not since the '84 Olympics has the

whole city had an such an opportunity --

WALTHER

Carson?

(Carson nods)

Walther. Who told the Ambassador?

CARSON

His Security Chief.

(beat)

There was a civilian with them --

fifteen-year-old girl from across

the street. We're trying to reach

the parents.

WALTHER

Goddamn it...

(sotto)

Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean

Premier's niece! We're hearing

rumors they're gonna make a major

issue out of what happened here...

CARSON

I'm not so sure what happened here.

Something smells. Asshole was acting

like he wanted us to spot him...

WALTHER

What the hell are you talking about?

AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)

Mr. Walther?

WALTHER

Ambassador Han... my deepest --

AMBASSADOR HAN

-- I have no wish for condolences.

Just answers.

WALTHER

As soon as we have any to give...

AMBASSADOR HAN

(into phone)

Yoon..?!

CARSON

(to FBI agents)

Start a trace!

WALTHER

(into phone)

Mr. Secretary... they're alive!

COLONEL LEE

(to Carson; incensed)

You are tapping our phones?!

CARSON

(while crossing to

Ambassador Han)

Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl

Streep.

MRS. HAN

(into phone)

We are not hurt. But this man is

very serious --

JAVAL

(into phone)

I want you to remember the feeling

you had when you thought your family

was dead, and use it to inform the

choices you're about to make.

CARSON

Say you want to talk to the kids...

AMBASSADOR HAN

(into phone)

I need to know my children are all

right.

JAVAL (VO)

(thru phone)

Be in front of a television in two

minutes. Tune it to channel four.

You'll get the picture.

AMBASSADOR HAN

There is a television in my office.

ROBBINS (VO)

(thru radio)

We're screwed on the trace -- he's

on a cell phone.

DAVE

Play the tape back. I might be able

to pull the electronic serial number

out of the subcarrier.

CARSON (VO)

(thru radio)

Ask Dave if he knows how to find the

phone's serial number.

ROBBINS

(smiles; into radio)

Hey, great idea...

CARSON (OS)

Oh, Jesus, those're explosives!

(beat)

Look at the TV -- this was just

taken.

JAVAL (VO)

(thru phone)

There must surely be several people

in the room; you may put me on the

speakerbox if you wish.

JAVAL (VO)

(continuing; thru

speakerbox)

I am not a terrorist. Your

countries' political posturing means

nothing to me. So do not waste time

trying to negotiate.

(beat)

The Federal Reserve Bank of Los

Angeles can furnish ten million

dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The

required denominations are in the

instructions, as is the method of

packaging. Be in your car at 3:00

PM, and drive north on Highland

Avenue. I will call with where to

leave the money, which you will do

at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will

call again at 4:00 with the family's

location and the method for removing

them from their... predicament.

Could you please refer to page one?

(they look at the photo)

Any deviation from these instructions

and my device will fulfill its

function at exactly 5:00 PM.

AMBASSADOR HAN

(to Walther)

P'yUngyang must approve the ransom...

WALTHER

Of course. The FBI's top Hostage

Negotiator is on the way --

CARSON

-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last

thing we need! This asshole sound

like he was interested in bargaining?

WALTHER

We have people who are experts in

these situations. We really feel it

would be best if you let them

coordinate everything...

WALTHER

(continuing; to Carson)

Let's get on it...

CARSON

...You're gonna just pay up, count

on his good nature to return the

family?!

WALTHER

It's the President's intention to

keep this quiet, move forward with

the Summit, and work with the North

Koreans. Jesus, you've already

embarrassed the shit out of us over

the phone surveillance --

CARSON

-- They know their phones are tapped!

They tap our fucking phones!

WALTHER

That's not the point! The point is

not acknowledging it!

(beat)

We got an international incident

brewing, with a country we were

practically at war with last year!

Our best Negotiator is gonna run

point. If you got a problem, you can

take the goddamn rest of the day off.

CARSON

This Consulate is my responsibility.

WALTHER

Not any more.

WALTHER

(continuing)

That's the Negotiator. You do the

briefing.

CUT TO:

CARSON

...Our worst enemy'll be the city.

There are events gearing up all

around town, and a dozen world

leaders arriving. Add the Friday

rush hour and usual L.A. bad

behavior and it'll be a nightmare

out there by 3 PM. It all works to

the advantage of the kidnapper,

hinders our pursuit efforts...

(frowns)

You don't agree?

MIRANDA

I'm wondering whether to believe him

when he says he's strictly motivated

by money.

CARSON

(grabs faxes back)

You see one word of Peoples'-

Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary

whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about-

this-week bullshit in this entire

letter?

MIRANDA

I still want to check the MO against

known politicals, terrorists --

CARSON

-- Already doing it. We're

coordinating with the Secret

Service, the NSA and the CIA.

MIRANDA

Have someone talk to the LAPD, give

them a cover story for the media

about the crash on La Cienega.

WALTHER

Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll

is your wife?!

CARSON

(while looking at Miranda)

If she'd changed her name when we

got married, I wouldn't have to.

MIRANDA

(to Carson)

I'm so enjoying this opportunity to

finally work together...

WALTHER

Jesus, forget I asked.

(beat)

The cash will be here in an hour.

(to Miranda)

Any thoughts on the kidnapper's

thoughts?

MIRANDA

Everything indicates he's working

alone. And his concerns do seem to

be solely about the money... so I

agree that he's only using the

Summit and the tension with North

Korea to create extreme motivation

to pay the ransom.

COLONEL LEE

I will bring the money to him.

CARSON

My ass.

COLONEL LEE

The hostages are citizens of the

People's Republic of Korea --

CARSON

-- Hey, do I go to the torture

chambers in your prisons, tell you

how to do your job?

WALTHER

All right, you're outta here! Is

this the same insubordinate crap you

pulled at Beverly Thrift?

CARSON

I'll coordinate the drop.

AMBASSADOR HAN

Perhaps that is better. Inspector

Carson knows the terrain --

COLONEL LEE

-- Then he can come with me.

WALTHER

(firm; to Carson)

It's settled.

CARSON

It sucks.

MIRANDA

But it means we can get on with it.

MIRANDA

(sotto)

Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther.

If the Bureau had listened to Pete,

Beverly Thrift never would've

happened.

JAVAL

That's more like it...

OPERATIVE

(into uplink device)

...They've got the Premier agreeing

to the hard-line position --

OPERATIVE

(continuing; sotto)

More to follow...

DAVE

I wanted to be home by now, take the

kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.

SABATINI

We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now,

L.A. was supposed to be a brown

blotch in the rear-view mirror.

MIRANDA

He'll expect a homing device --

CARSON

-- I expect him to expect it. He'll

check the cash with an RF detector...

(re larger transmitter)

Meaning he'll find this one.

(re smaller transmitter)

This only has a quarter-mile range,

but on a frequency too low to detect.

(turns off receiver)

And I doubt the asshole will have an

X-ray machine or a metal detector.

MIRANDA

Why must you always refer generically

to criminals as "assholes?"

CARSON

Gosh, you're right. It could

undermine their self-esteem and spoil

their chances for rehabilitation.

MIRANDA

You been reading my magazines in the

bathroom again?

JAVAL (VO)

(thru recorder)

"And my device will fulfill its

function at exactly 5:00 PM..."

MIRANDA

He's really exhibiting pressured

speech... big effort here to sound

calm. Same with his vocabulary... if

he were in control, he wouldn't feel

such a need to sound that way.

CARSON

Just tell me if we can use it.

MIRANDA

If we needle him he could get sloppy

and give us an opening, but I'm not

going to risk it. This is the worst

kind of perpetrator: anything makes

him deviate from his carefully-

scripted plan, he could become

extremely volatile.

MIRANDA (VO)

(thru headphones)

Do we have back-up if the bleeper

fails?

CARSON (VO)

(thru headphones)

Nothing but physical surveillance.

MIRANDA

It's real important we don't lose

him. He didn't go through all the

trouble of designing that bomb not

to use it.

CARSON

Well, it ain't gonna happen.

(beat; sotto)

Not again...

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

What the hell is the big crisis?

SECRETARY OF STATE

We just received a missive from the

North Korean attachE. They say the

kidnapping is a U.S. plot to provoke

and humiliate them during the Summit.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

Bullshit. They're just ticked because

we don't want the Chinese dragging

their asses into the treaty talks.

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

We have a covert operative in place.

He reports the hard-liners and

moderates in the High Command are

arguing about how to respond, should

the Premier's niece and her children

should be killed.

PRESIDENT

(scowls; thru video link)

Respond?! Christ. What about the

damn Premier?

SECRETARY OF STATE

He's weak. He has to look tough to

save face, keep control of hard-

liners... otherwise he risks a coup.

CIA CHIEF

Which is a real possibility. Most of

those old-fart Generals don't want to

-more-

CIA CHIEF (Cont'd)

be part of the Summit any more than

we want them to. They're mad as hell

he even talked to the Chinese.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

I don't want to deal with this right

now! Get our diplomats on it. Tell

the North we'll pay the ransom for

'em... Placate 'em! And make damn

sure we get that family back in one

piece. Who's in charge in L.A.?

FBI CHIEF

The Bureau, Sir. We have a crack

team in place.

SECRETARY OF STATE

There's a Diplomatic Liaison from

State, too.

CIA CHIEF

(to FBI Chief)

What about your man stationed at the

Consulate...

(refers to notes)

Carson? He was demoted from the FBI

Hostage Program, couple years back.

And this did happen on his watch...

FBI CHIEF

(irritated)

There's no way he could've prevented

this abduction! Besides, I've got one

of my top Negotiators in charge --

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

-- Whatever. I want a total news

blackout and I want this over with,

quickly! Without giving those Commie

little bastards any excuse to shit

all over my Summit!

MIRANDA

(into phone)

Yes, please go ahead...

JAVAL (VO)

(long beat; thru phone)

Ah... this must be one of those

professionals --

MIRANDA

(into phone)

-- I'm only here to see that

everyone gets what they want --

JAVAL (VO)

(thru phone)

-- I've got my shotgun in little

Lisa's mouth, and I will pull the

trigger in five seconds unless you

put the Ambassador on the phone.

MIRANDA (VO)

(thru radio)

The drop is at the DeMille barn,

across from the Hollywood Bowl.

You're to leave the money in the

center of the parking lot.

CARSON

(into radio)

Shit... no way we can set up a stake-

out in...

-more-

CARSON (Cont'd)

(checks watch)

Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers

at the Bowl. Have them clear the

area of civilians.

MIRANDA (VO)

(thru radio)

Remember, Pete... we're dealing with

a customer with a lot of rage.

CARSON

(to himself)

Must've bought a house same time we

did.

CARSON

(into radio)

There's about a hundred ways he can

scurry off like a cockroach from

here... So spread out.

DAVE

(into radio)

Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream

truck!

DAVE

Son of a bitch!

(into radio)

He found the bleepers -- both of

them!

CARSON

(into radio)

Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like

he'll be hard to see in that truck.

Which way's he heading?

DAVE (VO)

(thru radio)

Toward the freeway.

MIRANDA

(into radio)

What happened?

CARSON (VO)

(thru radio)

We're made! Gotta grab him!

MIRANDA

(beat; into radio)

All right... Carefully...

CARSON

Watch it! We need him alive!

COLONEL LEE

Turn around!

CARSON

FBI. Call our office, they'll take

care of you.

BIKER

I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn

dentist!

CARSON

Just don't kill yourself, you piece

of shit...

CARSON

(continuing; into radio)

Helicopter or two would be nice!

MIRANDA

(into radio)

Love to be in the loop on this...

CARSON

(to himself)

Not just now, dear...

CARSON

(continuing; grumbling)

I coulda had a ranch... maybe some

horses... but no, we moved to L.A.

CARSON

(into radio)

He's on foot, at the base of the

elevator tower!

CARSON

(into radio)

Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!

CARSON

Fingerprint it.

(to Walther)

He's not gonna tell us where to find

the hostages...

-more-

CARSON (Cont'd)

(looks at watch)

Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to

figure it out for ourselves.

WALTHER

Figure it out?! With what?!

CARSON

(ignores him; into radio)

Miranda! We need a copter, pronto!

(to Robbins)

Get back to his van. There were no

plates, but check the VIN, look it

over, then meet us at the Consulate.

CARSON

(continuing)

Go!

CUT TO:

CARSON

(to Walther)

...Scrounge us some bodies: National

Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local

PD's, meter maids --

WALTHER

-- They're gonna search the whole

city in a goddamn hour..?!

CARSON

Look, I don't need you to tell me

how fucked we are!

WALTHER

Fuck you!! Every time you're on a

case something explodes!

MIRANDA

Stop! The clock's running! Arguing

is a luxury we can't afford!

-more-

MIRANDA (Cont'd)

(looks at Carson)

What's done is done. There'll be

plenty of time to point fingers

later.

SABATINI

I need some fuckin' ink!!

AMBASSADOR HAN

This is impossible! How can you even

begin to find them?

MIRANDA

Well, the normal procedure is to

negotiate with the perpetrator...

CARSON

Let's take stock. We've got a picture

of where he hid the family, and

recordings of his calls --

MIRANDA

-- That's right! We can send them to

our experts for analysis...

CARSON

(to Ambassador Han)

Same with his fingerprints. But that

means we need high-quality image and

data transmission. We can piss away

ten minutes coptering this shit to

our offices in Westwood, or we can

use your surveillance equipment.

COLONEL LEE

There is no surveillance equipment.

This is a diplomatic facility --

CARSON

-- You want to play games, fine.

AMBASSADOR HAN

Take them upstairs.

CARSON

South Korean Consulate's just down

the street -- want to take a listen?

CARSON

(continuing; re hand)

Shitcan that thing, will you?!

CARSON

(continuing; to Colonel Lee)

Got a digital scanner?

COLONEL LEE

Analog.

CARSON

(looks equipment over)

You might want to drop a few bucks at

Radio Shack and get with the decade.

(into radio)

Dave -- get in here. Bring your

computer, a city map, and the tapes

of the ransom calls.

DAVE (VO)

(thru radio)

On my way...

MIRANDA

(to Colonel Lee)

Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe

him to the Ambassador, see if it's

anyone he knows.

CARSON

(into phone)

This is Carson in L.A. There's a set

of prints coming over. Narrow the

search criteria: Male, thirties,

Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss,

maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and

bombers first. We need an answer in

fifteen minutes.

FINGERPRINT TECH

(into phone)

That yellow air out there finally

rot your brain?! It's impossible!

CARSON (VO)

(thru phone)

Dazzle me.

CARSON

(to Walther)

We got one of the best sound guys

right here in town...

(into phone)

Newman in Audio Analysis...

DAVE (OS)

Newman's gone.

DAVE

He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a

bed and breakfast in Wyoming.

DAVE

(continuing; looks around)

Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like

to see the fight tonight.

CARSON

Get those tapes transferred to a

sound guy. We need ambient and

background analysis, the whole

enchilada.

DAVE

Enchilada -- you saying that because

I'm Mexican?

CARSON

No... 'cause you're fat.

MIRANDA

(picks up Javal's fax)

Photo enhancement... Isn't there

some amazing tech with the LAPD --

DAVE

-- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle

PD a month ago.

CARSON

Jesus H. Christ...

SABATINI

I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA

earn their keep.

CARSON

Do it.

MIRANDA

Given his behavior, this orange

residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg.

Amphetamines.

CARSON

Any significance?

MIRANDA

It's consistent with the lone wolf

scenario: A handful of these is pure

bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the

psychosis and paranoia kick in.

(beat)

We could check pharmacy records, on

the remote chance he got them

legally... if we had a couple of

weeks, that is.

CARSON

(to Sabatini)

Get the Bureau on it.

MIRANDA

Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.

CARSON

Look, goddammit, you start skipping

no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all

quit and go to the beach right now.

CARSON

(continuing)

He grabbed the family at 8:30. The

last certain visual we had was just

before his van went into the alley

on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the

Consulate at 9:30.

MIRANDA

That gives him about fifty minutes

to get to his location, move and

secure the hostages, and activate

his time bomb.

CARSON

He probably waited a while to pad

the time -- he wanted us know the

family was still alive...

(sotto; re Koreans)

...So these crazy bastards wouldn't

throw a premature shit hemorrhage,

but he didn't want to call too soon,

either. I say they're within 15 to

20 minutes, via surface streets, of

where we last saw them.

MIRANDA

The most densely-populated part of

the L.A. basin. This narrows it down

to about 200,000 dwellings.

MIRANDA

(continuing)

He was traveling west --

CARSON

-- Bet he doubled back.

MIRANDA

C'mon, that's total conjecture --

SABATINI

(re Carson)

-- I'd trust his instincts when

dealing with maniacs. He is deeply

disturbed.

MIRANDA

You're telling me?

SECRETARY OF STATE

...North Koreans have gone ballistic,

accusing us of botching the ransom

drop on purpose.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

They're still harping on that

"American plot" nonsense.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

Meaning?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

They say the death of the Premier's

niece and her family would justify

immediate retaliation.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

Are they out of their fuckin' minds?!

What kind of retaliation?

CIA CHIEF

They're threatening to pull a Saddam

Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed

at Jerusalem during Desert Storm?

(beat)

They're talking about firing a

missile into Los Angeles --

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

-- A goddamn WHAT??

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range

cruise -- their version of our

Tomahawk, launched from offshore.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

The AS-15 is gyro-guided. It will

find the city, but it's not too

accurate beyond that.

VICE PRESIDENT

Still, for their purposes it's

perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take

out a city block or two...

SECRETARY OF STATE

To the eyes of the world it's a

measured response -- like what Reagan

did to Qaddafi. But actually striking

at an American city would be a huge

psychological victory for them.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

I don't believe I'm hearing this!

(beat)

So if we know it's coming, we can

knock it out of the fuckin' sky!

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

These weapons fly subsonically, below

radar... we don't have the defenses

in place... If we'd had the time to

deploy a string of Patriot anti-

missile batteries across the coast --

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

-- You're saying we got all this

lousy hardware and can't stop one

goddamn missile??

PRESIDENT

(continuing; thru video

link)

I want an immediate search for all

ships within range.

FBI CHIEF

We better inform the other leaders,

stall on the Summit --

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

There's no reason to panic yet --

they can't launch until after the

family's confirmed dead!

CIA CHIEF

Afraid that's not the case...

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

The North Korean Premier holds what

we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's

able to destroy a missile in flight,

right up to the moment before it

achieves its target.

CIA CHIEF

Our Op says they've timed their

retaliation to hit right after 5:00.

FBI CHIEF

And if the family turns up okay,

they'll just make it self-destruct.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

Shit! I really don't need this today!

VICE PRESIDENT

We're forgetting one thing here: the

family. Intelligence is sure the

North will abort their attack if Mrs.

Han and her kids are safely returned?

CIA CHIEF

Absolutely. Their whole game depends

on claiming a legitimate provocation.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Still, we should let them know there'd

be a response... if it comes to it.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

I'd like to turn 'em into a

radioactive parking lot.

SECRETARY OF STATE

That's the problem: we can't. We're

the last superpower. Our hands are

tied by politics, alliances, goddamn

stacks of treaties... most we could

do is give 'em a "measured response"

back again, or everyone starts

crying that we're the bullies.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Damn, I miss the Cold War. Russians

wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a

stunt like this.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

Believe me, the North drops one in

my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in

theirs. Get some bombers in the air.

And don't tell me any more bad news!

ROBBINS

(into radio)

...Phone company decal's a fake. DMV

says the van was purchased a week ago

from a private party in Santa Monica.

I called 'em; they said the guy paid

cash, and he fits our boy's

description. Signed the name "Douglas

McArthur" to the Transfer of Title.

CARSON

(into radio)

Cute.

(to Miranda)

He signed the name of the Allied

Commander during the Korean War.

Maybe he was a political.

MIRANDA

No. The phony ice cream truck, the

booby-trapped chairs... he could've

-more-

MIRANDA (Cont'd)

done it without half that stuff. But

this was going to be the score of a

lifetime... he was showing off.

CARSON

(to Dave)

Who's got those kinds of skills:

Electronics, vehicle customizing,

computers, explosives?

DAVE

Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your

average high-school student if

they're so inclined. My guess is our

perp used off-the-shelf equipment

for everything except the C-4, and

that's only slightly harder to get

than crack or heroin, if you know

who to ask.

BOBBI (VO)

Please, L.A., I know we're about to

have quite a party out there, but

don't forget the Golden Rule on the

roadways... News time is 3:59...

BOBBI

This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye

in the Sky... back to you, Brent...

BOBBI

(continuing; furious)

Hey, dickhead... I was backlit that

entire segment!

(as if to a child)

Keep... the sun... to my left!!

BOBBI

(continuing)

What's new on the kidnapping rumor?

CAMERAMAN

Nada. Total news blackout.

BOBBI

Go back over the hill.

NEWS PILOT

We got the valley traffic report in

fifteen --

BOBBI

-- "Stalled vehicle! One lane closed!

Sig alert..!" I'll improvise!

BOBBI

(continuing; to Cameraman)

What are you lookin' at? I was the

morning anchor in Houston! And I'm

one break away from getting out of

this stupid fuckin' whirlybird!

JOY

Why us?

MRS. HAN

You heard him -- for money.

JOY

What if something goes wrong?

MRS. HAN

(firmly)

It won't.

CARSON

I'm going to the kidnapping site.

MIRANDA

I want to talk to the witnesses.

CARSON

Great, we'll hire a bus.

DAVE

(into phone)

...I know it's privileged

information, goddammit! Lemme talk

to a supervisor... You are a

supervisor... Lemme talk to your

goddamn supervisor... I told you,

I'm with the FBI...

(to Sabatini)

Cellular company says he was using a

phone with a cloned number.

SABATINI

Big surprise. Have 'em send a list of

the numbers called on the account.

DAVE

That's what I'm trying to get.

They're saying I need a subpoena.

(into phone)

Don't put me on hold... Don't...

(pulls phone from his ear)

I'm listening to Michael fuckin'

Bolton!

SABATINI

Walther! Get on the horn to Justice

and deal with this!

ROBBINS

(into radio)

A lot of the components are made by

the same manufacturer -- a car

security company.

CARSON (VO)

(thru radio)

Jump a copter to the Consulate. See

if the manufacturer sells to the

public. Find out what shops use their

stuff; put people on the phones with

a description of the perp.

YOUNG COP

Inspector! Look at this...

(reads from shell)

"Dragon's Breath..?"

CARSON

Twelve-gauge shell filled with

magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's

worse than napalm -- Geneva

Convention outlawed it for warfare.

MIRANDA

Then how did he get it?

CARSON

Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order.

(looks around)

Where's the Consulate's car?

YOUNG COP

(beat)

Uh... apparently it was stolen...

COLONEL LEE

Stolen!? What is it with you

people --

YOUNG COP

(angry)

-- What's this "you people" shit?

CARSON

(to Colonel Lee)

Shut up!

MIRANDA

(aside; to Young Cop)

He means all of us "you people."

CARSON

(to Young Cop)

Find it! How many bulletproof

Mercedes could be cruising around

Crenshaw?

YOUNG COP

You'd be surprised...

CARSON

I hate this fuckin' town.

CARSON

Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was

working alone, and he was a vicious

son of a bitch. Old news.

COLONEL LEE

(to Ambassador Han)

And our car was stolen.

AMBASSADOR HAN

I felt safer when I was the

Ambassador to Libya.

SABATINI

Image enhancements came back.

CARSON

We going steady?

SABATINI

The sun position tells us the

windows are facing northeast.

(beat)

Here's the best -- look at the glass

on the prints hanging in the

background. There's a reflection of

a reflection, out on the street: the

corner of a billboard.

CARSON

Looks like the wheel of a car.

MIRANDA

We talked about these billboards,

when we were car shopping! Four-

door... they make a wagon, too.

(beat)

Something Japanese... God, what was

it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You

thought it had no character.

CARSON

I thought that about all of them.

C'mon, think, dammit!!

MIRANDA

You think!! You were there, too!

CARSON

Call the outdoor advertising

companies. Get the location of all

the billboards for Japanese cars

within our search parameters.

DAVE

(into phone)

...Peerless Auto Security. We need

to know whether you've sold a large

quantity of these components to any

one customer, or whether you'd had

any stolen recently...

CUT TO:

OPERATIVE

(urgently; into device)

...Missile heading to L.A. has a

Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is

Kipchak equipped! It was switched by

order of --

MRS. HAN

He asked you if you had to go...

JOY

Oh, my God...

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

Uh, it's a code name... for weapons

using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

(continuing)

Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347

they attacked a Genoese fort, and

catapulted infected corpses over the

walls. The Genoese who survived

carried the disease back to Europe...

and it killed half the population.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

Get to the goddamn point, Major.

CIA CHIEF

Seems the missile is armed with a

warhead carrying the Pneumonic

Plague.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

The Black Plague?! Every time I talk

to you fuckin' guys it gets worse!

What happened to this "limited

retaliation" shit?

SECRETARY OF STATE

The North Koreans insist the missile

carries a conventional payload. They

say we're trying to trick them into

aborting the attack.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Especially since the uplink from our

Op in P'yUngyang was unencrypted.

CIA CHIEF

We think one of the Hard-liners

switched the warhead without the

Premier's knowledge. But he's not

about to take our word for it, and

he's too weak to risk the

humiliation of backing down.

PRESIDENT

(incredulous; thru video

link)

They use a biological weapon on

American soil, they have to know

we'll respond!

SECRETARY OF STATE

Maybe they don't think we got the

guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause

they think they can whip us, like

what happened in 'Nam. Look who

we're dealing with: a teetering,

outlaw regime, and inside it, some

wild-ass renegades working their

screwy agenda!

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

What the hell are we doing in L.A.?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

We've deployed Marines from Pendleton

and Twenty-Nine Palms, Army from Ft.

Irwin, put 'em in protective suits,

but it's 40 minutes before they're on

the ground.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

All right. Assuming the worst...

What'll happen?

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

The warhead vents the plague

bacteria above the target area,

infecting about 50,000 people. First

symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes

become swollen; temperature rises to

105. Victims turn deep purple from

lung hemorrhaging, usually die the

same day.

(beat)

There are treatments -- streptomycin

and tetracyclines -- but we'd be

overwhelmed by the numbers and its

extreme contagiousness.

CIA CHIEF

We could have 500,000 infected in a

week, who knows how many after that.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have

the Summit leaders been warned?

FBI CHIEF

Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A.

'til we give the all-clear.

PRESIDENT

(thru video link)

And you're sure it's safe if we can

get 'em to destroy the missile in

flight?

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

The bacteria can't survive the heat

of an explosion.

CIA CHIEF

I suggest none of this go any

further -- not even to the agents

working to find the family. Word

leaks out to a city of 12 million

people there's rocket full of the

Plague coming at 'em, you'll create

a panic of biblical proportions.

CARSON

Say what?

COLONEL LEE

Perhaps someone will decide it is

foolish to incur the wrath of North

Korea.

CARSON

(crosses to Colonel Lee)

Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole

thing. And we're knocking our heads,

trying to find your people, just for

show.

WALTHER

Carson...

CARSON

Let's grab a few beers, kick back

'til five o'clock rolls by. Then

maybe we can have a war over it. I

think that's a great idea, seeing as

how you fuckers have needed your

clocks cleaned for fifty years now!

COLONEL LEE

(gets up)

Why wait until five?

MIRANDA

Pete!

(sotto)

Christ, you're self-indulgent!

There's nothing but anger and

cynicism left inside you, so they're

all you can express any more. No

wonder everyone in the Bureau thinks

you're such a nutcase!

CARSON

Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep

around the office... "Dr. Knoll-It-

All."

MIRANDA

(hurt)

You've been dying to tell me that...

CARSON

Miranda...

(to himself)

Shit.

ROBBINS

...Yeah, Peerless Auto Security...

fine... get your manager...

up... This an immigration thing?

Shit, he's our best installer.

ESPIONAGE AGENT

Inspector Carson, extension 666...

Paul Javal's shoe size.

CARSON

Carson...

EDWARDS (VO)

Edwards, Sound Lab...

CARSON (VO)

(thru phone)

Whatta you got?

EDWARDS

(into phone)

Ambient background sound is normal

city stuff, but there's a distinct

echo pattern. Your people are in or

near a high-rise that's at least

eight floors tall. And there are

other high-rises nearby.

CARSON (VO)

(thru phone)

How high up are they?

EDWARDS

(into phone)

No way to extrapolate that from the

sample you gave us.

(refers to notes)

One more thing: There's an emergency

siren approaching at 17 seconds into

the second call, passing the location

at 33.5 seconds.

CARSON

Okay -- high-rises in our search

area. Eight stories or higher.

MIRANDA

Downtown, Century City, Westwood

corridor, Museum Row, Mid-

Wilshire... North of Sunset Strip

there's a few...

CARSON

Sabatini! What about that billboard?

SABATINI

Nothing yet! Everyone's left their

goddamn offices already!

CARSON

(to Robbins)

LAPD will have a record of all

emergency vehicles running Code 3 at

9:32 AM. Get their starting point

and their destination.

MIRANDA

And have them narrow their foot-

searches to areas around high-rises.

CARSON

(to Dave)

Where's that fuckin' address?!

DAVE

I'm still holdin'!

DAVE

(continuing)

He's on our hit parade. Interpol

passed us his records when he

entered the country.

(reads)

French by birth... looks like a total

scumbag.

SABATINI

Isn't that redundant?

DAVE

(reads from computer)

Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe;

served some short stretches, petty

shit... arrested for kidnapping, no

conviction. Did four years in France

for blowing bank vaults. Moved to

U.S. last year. Clean since then.

CARSON

Get his Driver's License number;

Social; bank accounts; charge cards;

club memberships... find out what

movies he rented.  Get whoever's

closest to the Auto Shop to get in

there, interview everybody.

MIRANDA

This sure was a ballsy move for a

car-alarm installer.

CARSON

Hey, he watched the news... Everyone

knows the U.S. will do anything to

avoid trouble with a mad-dog country.

MIRANDA

Ambassador --

CARSON

-- Quit apologizing for me!

MIRANDA

Quit giving me reasons to!

AMBASSADOR HAN

(to Carson)

On occasion, my wife has been known

to kick my ankle under the table.

CARSON

Sounds like her aim's a little low.

DAVE

Address, according to the Auto Shop.

CARSON

(looks at paper)

Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise!

Sabatini -- you're with us.

(off Robbins' disappointed

look)

She's got the field experience.

MIRANDA

There still could be accomplices.

If there are, they'll hear us in

the helicopter.

CARSON

There's a TV station a couple blocks

away. We'll land on their pad.

(to Robbins)

K-EYE. Clear it with 'em. Have a

SWAT team assemble, but tell 'em to

hang back unless we need 'em.

OPERATIVE'S VOICE (VO)

CARSON

We can't get into that right now...

BOBBI

Hey, you expect to use my station's

What the fuck are you, the Barbie

Corporate Ass-Lick model?

MIRANDA

Guess what, Sister... you're about

CARSON

Terrific. Who else is here?

CARSON

Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.

it's authentic!

CARSON

What's the status?

ROBBINS (VO)

I should've known she'd come up.

MIRANDA

familiar word.

(long beat)

They want it by the book: talk them

out.

Intelligence that a biological weapon,

allegedly containing the deadly

Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los

Angeles. While unconfirmed, the

he made sure Javal got killed, so

they'd have an excuse to drop their

AMBASSADOR HAN

There are men in my government whose

power depends on North Korea staying

as it is: Socialist, repressive,

isolated from the world. They'll

resort to anything, even war, to

keep it that way. They have the

Hitler Syndrome: if their country

cannot exist the way they want it,

they would rather see it destroyed.

VREELAND (VO)

(thru radio)

FBI, this is Major Vreeland.

Discontinue your pursuit, we're

gonna box his ears from up here.

CARSON

(into radio)

Negative -- his car's armored! And we

need the bastard alive!!

VREELAND (VO)

(thru radio)

We've got the situation in hand.

VREELAND

(to Pilot)

Shit! Pull back!

BOBBI

(to TV camera)

Jesus fuckin' God!!!

(beat; smiles)

Uh, I think we're gonna set down

now. Back to you, Brent.

VREELAND

(into radio)

Out of the air, or retreat 7,000

meters from target vehicle!

JOY

I always hated that guy...

CARSON

One of yours?

(Han nods)

What the hell do you need heat-

seeking rockets for in L.A.?

AMBASSADOR HAN

There could be another riot...

CARSON

(shakes his head)

And they call me Mr. Overkill.

(into radio)

Dave, what do you know about...

AMBASSADOR HAN

Strela-2...

CARSON

(into radio)

Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets?

DAVE

(into radio)

I'm with ya... Strela-2. Perenosniy

zenitniy raketniy kompleks. Russian

factory index 9K-32-M2 --

CARSON (VO)

(thru radio)

-- Skip the goddamn trivia! I need

range, guidance, arming method,

anything we can work with...

MIRANDA (VO)

(thru radio)

-- You don't "work with" rockets,

Peter!

MIRANDA

(into radio)

Stay back. LAPD's putting up a

roadblock.

BOBBI

Save it for someone who gives a

shit!

DAVE (VO)

(thru radio)

...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to

arm, so stay tight on his ass.

CARSON

That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses

you'd like to tell me about?

AMBASSADOR HAN

I don't think so -- they said it was

solid as a rock.

CARSON

(looks at his crumpled car)

No shit...

AMBASSADOR HAN

(dazed)

I can't believe I'm still alive...

CARSON

This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.

CARSON

Get me out of here...

CARSON

(continuing; into radio)

Anybody see him?

MIRANDA (VO)

(thru radio)

Still heading north on the 110.

CARSON

(into radio)

Dave... You're sure those rockets

are heat-seeking?

DAVE (VO)

(thru radio)

Classic IR, reflective optical

system. How come?

CARSON

(into radio)

Just keep working your leads...

CARSON

(into radio)

This is Carson. I need a copter.

CARSON (VO)

(thru radio)

Something small and nimble.

Anybody... come in low, from the

south... I'm on an ambulance by the

9th Street exit.

MIRANDA (VO)

(thru radio)

Are you out of your mind?

BOBBI

Get this fuckin' thing in the air!

(to Cameraman)

Out! Not enough room for four.

CAMERAMAN

(as they TAKE OFF)

What am I supposed to do when the

plague comes, hold my breath?

MIRANDA

(into radio)

Switch to a secure channel.

(flips a switch)

What on earth are you thinking?

CARSON (VO)

(thru radio)

I'll make him open the sunroof.

Someone can shoot tear gas or a

percussion grenade inside.

MIRANDA

(into radio)

Pete, you haven't gone... suicidal or

anything on me, have you?

CARSON (VO)

(thru radio)

No way. I couldn't stand making so

many people happy.

CARSON

You?! I wanted a police copter!

PILOT

Just tell me what to do. I flew two

tours in 'Nam.

BOBBI

And he doesn't go unless I go!

CARSON

Wrong-o...

CUT TO:

BOBBI

I'm a respected electronic

journalist, you fuckin' prick!!

CARSON

(into radio)

Got 'im -- looks like he's headed

for the 101.

CARSON

(to Pilot)

Pull hard to the left, on my

signal...

CARSON

Now!

MIRANDA

You fucking lunatic!!

PILOT

Hope you got more flares than he's

got rockets.

MIRANDA

Sorry...

MIRANDA

You're completely deranged! Playing

chicken with rockets!

CARSON

Well, what the hell were you doing

out there?

AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)

What are both of you doing?

CARSON

Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!

MIRANDA

Even if we can pry him out with...

(looks at her watch)

Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll

be very cooperative.

CARSON

I'll just use my outstanding people

skills.

CARSON

(continuing; to Ambassador

Han)

That car's like a rock, right?

MIRANDA

Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps?

Well, these are fuck you pumps!

(pushes harder)

Where's the family?

DAVE

Holy shit -- Knoll-It-All's turned

into Dirty Harriet!

DAVE

(continuing; into phone)

You're sure there were no accounts in

the other names I gave you?

AMBASSADOR HAN

Let him up.

COLONEL LEE

Victory!

CARSON

(into radio)

Dave...

CARSON (VO)

(thru radio)

Anything else come through?

DAVE

(numb; into radio)

Take a hint. We're screwed.

CARSON (VO)

(thru radio)

Not yet...

DAVE

(into radio)

Wait! One of Javal's alias accounts:

check for an apartment rental!

CARSON (VO)

(thru radio)

You're shittin'... Where?!

CUT TO:

DAVE (VO)

Park La Brea!

CARSON

(into radio)

...Have the Manager evacuate the

complex. Find out which unit the

family's in, but don't let anyone go

in 'til we get there.

DAVE

(into radio)

Private security's going around with

PA's, and they set off the fire alarm.

(into phone)

Well, try callin' him again!

(into radio)

Manager's gone, and the Assistant

can't find the key to get to the

rental manifest.

(into phone)

Then kick the fuckin' door down!

MILTON

(into phone)

I'll try him in his car again...

WESTEC GUARDS (OS)

(thru car-mounted PA)

Tenants -- leave your apartments at

once... Take the stairs...

CARSON

"Fuck-you" pumps??

JOY

They must know we're here...

ALL

Help!

VOICE THRU PA

Han family. Show us your location...

JOY

Mother... Sam...

MRS. HAN

Do it.

MILTON

It's a brown binder... Says "Rental

Manifest." You can't miss it...

CARSON

(into radio)

Apartment number would be real

helpful, gang...

MIRANDA

There!

CARSON

Okay... work with me here!

LISA

Hurry, please hurry...

CARSON

DON'T!

CARSON

(continuing)

We have to go out the window.

MRS. HAN

Can't you disarm the bomb?

CARSON

Too risky. Let's concentrate on

getting you out of here.

CARSON

(continuing)

Sound detectors?

MRS. HAN

Sam covered them with chewing gum.

SAM

High-tech problem, low-tech solution.

CARSON

Pressure sensors. Use 'em in

convertibles: Bad guy sits on your

seat, he sets the alarm off. These

are rigged backwards -- get up, you

set 'em off.

SAM

You a bomb expert?

CARSON

Nope. But I've had some car alarms

in my day.

(to himself)

For all the goddamn good they do...

CARSON

(continuing; to Mrs. Han)

Slide your arm forward... Watch the

meter... Keep the pressure on the

armrest with your elbow...

CARSON

(continuing)

It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate

the weight of your arm... Okay...

pick it up.

CARSON

(continuing; to Sam)

Low-tech solution...

(to Mrs. Han)

Lean back... Carefully.

MIRANDA (VO)

(thru radio in his pocket)

How's it going in there?

CARSON

(to himself)

Nag, nag, nag...

CARSON

You'll be over in five seconds...

CARSON

Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook

and ride down on the line.

CARSON

(shouts)

Release the cable from your side!

Get out of here!

MIRANDA

(shouts back)

Come over the railing! Grab onto the

harness!

MIRANDA

Tear the hook loose!

PILOT

It'll pop the winch buckle!

MIRANDA

Try it anyway!

FADE THRU TO:

CARSON

(into phone)

...I'll call you next week.

MIRANDA

Who was that on the phone?

CARSON

The Bureau.

(beat)

They want me back on the hostage

team.

MIRANDA

What did you say?

CARSON

Told 'em I'd sleep on it...

MIRANDA

Working with you today was

certainly... interesting, Inspector.

CARSON

It's my outstanding people skills.

MIRANDA

I hate this fucking town...

FADE OUT.
