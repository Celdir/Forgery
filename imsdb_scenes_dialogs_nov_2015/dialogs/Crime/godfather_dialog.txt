The Godfather

THIRD DRAFT				PARAMOUNT PICTURES

1 Gulf and Western Plaza

March 29, 1971				New York, New York 10019

THE GODFATHER

BONASERA

America has made my fortune.

BONASERA

I raised my daughter in the American

fashion; I gave her freedom, but

taught her never to dishonor her

family.  She found a boy friend,

not an Italian.  She went to the

movies with him, stayed out late.

Two months ago he took her for a

drive, with another boy friend.

They made her drink whiskey and

then they tried to take advantage

of her.  She resisted; she kept her

honor.  So they beat her like an

animal.  When I went to the hospital

her nose was broken, her jaw was

shattered and held together by

wire, and she could not even weep

because of the pain.

BONASERA

I went to the Police like a good

American.  These two boys were

arrested and brought to trial.  The

judge sentenced them to three years

in prison, and suspended the

sentence.  Suspended sentence!

They went free that very day.  I

stood in the courtroom like a fool,

and those bastards, they smiled at

me.  Then I said to my wife, for

Justice, we must go to The Godfather.

DON CORLEONE

Bonasera, we know each other for

years, but this is the first time

you come to me for help.  I don't

remember the last time you invited

me to your house for coffee...even

though our wives are friends.

BONASERA

What do you want of me?  I'll give

you anything you want, but do what

I ask!

DON CORLEONE

And what is that Bonasera?

DON CORLEONE

No.  You ask for too much.

BONASERA

I ask for Justice.

DON CORLEONE

The Court gave you justice.

BONASERA

An eye for an eye!

DON CORLEONE

But your daughter is still alive.

BONASERA

Then make them suffer as she

suffers.  How much shall I pay you.

DON CORLEONE

You never think to protect yourself

with real friends.  You think it's

enough to be an American.  All

right, the Police protects you,

there are Courts of Law, so you

don't need a friend like me.

But now you come to me and say Don

Corleone, you must give me justice.

And you don't ask in respect or

friendship.  And you don't think to

call me Godfather; instead you come

to my house on the day my daughter

is to be married and you ask me to

do murder...for money.

BONASERA

America has been good to me...

DON CORLEONE

Then take the justice from the

judge, the bitter with the sweet,

Bonasera.  But if you come to me

with your friendship, your loyalty,

then your enemies become my enemies,

and then, believe me, they would

fear you...

BONASERA

Be my friend.

DON CORLEONE

Good.  From me you'll get Justice.

BONASERA

Godfather.

DON CORLEONE

Some day, and that day may never

come, I would like to call upon you

to do me a service in return.

DON CORLEONE

Where's Michael?

SONNY

He'll be here Pop, it's still early.

DON CORLEONE

Then the picture will wait for him.

SONNY

Sandra, watch the kids.  They're

running wild.

SANDRA

You watch yourself.

CLEMENZA

Paulie...wine...WINE.

PAULIE

You look terrif on the floor!

CLEMENZA

What are you, a dance judge?  Go do

your job; take a walk around the

neighborhood... see everything is

okay.

SONNY

Buddy, this is a private party.

SONNY

Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.

NAZORINE

...a fine boy from Sicily, captured

by the American Army, and sent to

New Jersey as a prisoner of war...

DON CORLEONE

Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I

can do.

NAZORINE

Now that the war is over, Enzo,

this boy is being repatriated to

Italy.  And you see, Godfather...

(he wrings his hands,

unable to express himself)

He...my daughter...they...

DON CORLEONE

You want him to stay in this country.

NAZORINE

Godfather, you understand everything.

DON CORLEONE

Tom, what we need is an Act of

Congress to allow Enzo to become a

citizen.

NAZORINE

(impressed)

An Act of Congress!

HAGEN

(nodding)

It will cost.

NAZORINE

Is that all?  Godfather, thank

you...

(backing out, enthusiastically)

Oh, wait till you see the cake I

made for your beautiful daughter!

HAGEN

Who do I give this job to?

DON CORLEONE

Not to one of our paisans...give it

to a Jew Congressman in another

district.  Who else is on the list

for today?

HAGEN

Francesco Nippi.  His nephew has

been refused parole.  A bad case.

HAGEN (O.S.)

His father worked with you in the

freight yards when you were young.

HAGEN (O.S.)

He's not on the list, but Luca

Brasi wants to see you.

DON CORLEONE

Is it necessary?

HAGEN

You understand him better than

anyone.

KAY

I've never seen anything like it.

MICHAEL

I told you I had a lot of relatives.

KAY

(amused)

Michael, what are those men doing?

MICHAEL

They're waiting to see my father.

KAY

They're talking to themselves.

MICHAEL

They're going to talk to my father,

which means they're going to ask

him for something, which means they

better get it right.

KAY

Why do they bother him on a day

like this?

MICHAEL

Because they know that no Sicilian

will refuse a request on his

daughter's wedding day.

CARLO

(whispered)

Cut it out, Connie.

PAULIE (O.S.)

What do you think?  Twenty grand?

PAULIE

Who knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty,

thirty grand in small bills cash in

that silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if

this was somebody else's wedding!

WOMAN

Is it true what they say about your

husband, Sandra?

KAY

(in a spooky low tone)

Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a

relative?

MICHAEL

No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You

wouldn't like him.

KAY

(Excited)

Who is he?

MICHAEL

(Sizing her up)

You really want to know?

KAY

Yes.  Tell me.

MICHAEL

You like spaghetti?

KAY

You know I love spaghetti.

MICHAEL

Then eat your spaghetti and I'll

tell you a Luca Brasi story.

MICHAEL

Once upon a time, about fifteen

years ago some people wanted to

take over my father's olive oil

business.  They had Al Capone send

some men in from Chicago to kill my

father, and they almost did.

KAY

Al Capone!

MICHAEL

My Father sent Luca Brasi after

them.  He tied the two Capone men

hand and foot, and stuffed small

bath towels into their mouths.

Then he took an ax, and chopped one

man's feet off...

KAY

Michael...

MICHAEL

Then the legs at the knees...

KAY

Michael you're trying to scare me...

MICHAEL

Then the thighs where they joined

the torso.

KAY

Michael, I don't want to hear

anymore...

MICHAEL

Then Luca turned to the other man...

KAY

Michael, I love you.

MICHAEL

...who out of sheer terror had

swallowed the bath towel in his

mouth and suffocated.

KAY

I never know when you're telling me

the truth.

MICHAEL

I told you you wouldn't like him.

KAY

He's coming over here!

MICHAEL

Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay

Adams.

KAY

(having survived LUCA)

How do you do.

MICHAEL

My brother, Tom Hagen.

HAGEN

Hello Kay.  Your father's inside,

doing some business.

(privately)

He's been asking for you.

MICHAEL

Thanks Tom.

KAY

If he's your brother, why does he

have a different name?

MICHAEL

My brother Sonny found him living

in the streets when he was a kid,

so my father took him in.  He's a

good lawyer.

LUCA (O.S.)

Don Corleone...

LUCA

(with difficulty)

Don Corleone...I am honored, and

grateful...that you invited me to

your home...on the wedding day of

your...daughter.

May their first child...be a

masculine child.  I pledge my never

ending loyalty.

(he offers the envelope)

For your daughter's bridal purse.

DON CORLEONE

Thank you, Luca, my most valued

friend.

LUCA

Let me leave you, Don Corleone.  I

know you are busy.

DON CORLEONE

I'm sure it's the most generous

gift today.

HAGEN

The Senator called--apologized for

not coming personally, but said

you'd understand.  Also, some of

the Judges...they've all sent gifts.

And another call from Virgil

Sollozzo.

HAGEN

The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo

has contacts in Turkey for the

poppy, in Sicily for the plants to

process down to morphine or up to

heroin.  Also he has access to this

country.  He's coming to us for

financial help, and some sort of

immunity from the law.  For that we

get a piece of the action, I

couldn't find out how much.

Sollozzo is vouched for by the

Tattaglia family, and they may have

a piece of the action.  They call

Sollozzo the Turk.

He's spent a lot of time in Turkey

and is suppose to have a Turkish

wife and kids.  He's suppose to be

very quick with the knife, or was,

when he was younger.  Only in

matters of business and with some

reasonable complaint.  Also he has

an American wife and three children

and he is a good family man.

HAGEN

He's his own boss, and very

competent.

DON CORLEONE

And with prison record.

HAGEN

Two terms; one in Italy, one in the

United States.  He's known to the

Government as a top narcotics man.

That could be a plus for us; he

could never get immunity to testify.

DON CORLEONE

When did he call?

HAGEN

This morning.

DON CORLEONE

On a day like this.  Consiglero, do

you also have in your notes the the

Turk made his living from

Prostitution before the war, like

the Tattaglias do now.  Write that

down before you forget it.  The

Turk will wait.

DON CORLEONE

What that?  It sounds like Johnny.

DON CORLEONE

It is Johnny.  He came all the way

from California to be at the wedding.

HAGEN

Should I bring him in.

DON CORLEONE

No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You

see?  He is a good godson.

HAGEN

It's been two years.  He's probably

in trouble again.

KAY

I didn't know your family knew

Johnny Fontane.

MICHAEL

Sure.

KAY

I used to come down to New York

whenever he sang at the Capitol and

scream my head off.

MICHAEL

He's my father's godson; he owes

him his whole career.

DON CORLEONE

My Godson has come three thousand

miles to do us honor and no one

thinks to wet his throat.

JOHNNY

I kept trying to call you after my

divorce and Tom always said you

were busy.  When I got the Wedding

invitation I knew you weren't sore

at me anymore, Godfather.

DON CORLEONE

Can I do something for you still?

You're not too rich, or too famous

that I can't help you?

JOHNNY

I'm not rich anymore, Godfather,

and...my career, I'm almost washed

up...

DON CORLEONE

Tell Santino to come in with us.

He should hear some things.

HAGEN

Sonny?

LUCY

Sonnyeeeeeeee.

HAGEN (O.S.)

Sonny?  Sonny, you in there?

HAGEN

The old man wants you; Johnny's

here...he's got a problem.

SONNY (O.S.)

Okay.  One minute.

DON CORLEONE

ACT LIKE A MAN!  By Christ in

Heaven, is it possible you turned

out no better than a Hollywood

finocchio.

DON CORLEONE

All right, Hollywood...Now tell me

about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta

who won't let you work.

JOHNNY

He owns the studio.  Just a month

ago he bought the movie rights to

this book, a best seller.  And the

main character is a guy just like

me.  I wouldn't even have to act,

just be myself.

DON CORLEONE

You take care of your family?

JOHNNY

Sure.

DON CORLEONE

You look terrible.  I want you to

eat well, to rest.  And spend time

with your family.  And then, at the

end of the month, this big shot

will give you the part you want.

JOHNNY

It's too late.  All the contracts

have been signed, they're almost

ready to shoot.

DON CORLEONE

I'll make him an offer he can't

refuse.

DON CORLEONE

Now go back to the party and leave

it to me.

DON CORLEONE

When does my daughter leave with

her bridegroom?

HAGEN

They'll cut the cake in a few

minutes...leave right after that.

Your new son-in-law, do we give him

something important?

DON CORLEONE

No, give him a living.  But never

let him know the family's business.

What else, Tom?

HAGEN

I've called the hospital; they've

notified Consiglere Genco's family

to come and wait.  He won't last

out the night.

DON CORLEONE

Genco will wait for me.  Santino,

tell your brothers they will come

with me to the hospital to see

Genco.  Tell Fredo to drive the big

car, and ask Johnny to come with us.

SONNY

And Michael?

DON CORLEONE

All my sons.

(to HAGEN)

Tom, I want you to go to California

tonight.  Make the arrangements.

But don't leave until I come back

from the hospital and speak to you.

Understood?

HAGEN

Understood.

DON CORLEONE

Will your girl friend get back to

the city all right?

MICHAEL

Tom said he'd take care of it.

DON CORLEONE

What was this for?

MICHAEL

For bravery.

DON CORLEONE

And this?

MICHAEL

For killing a man.

DON CORLEONE

What miracles you do for strangers.

MICHAEL

I fought for my country.  It was my

choice.

DON CORLEONE

And now, what do you choose to do?

MICHAEL

I'm going to finish school.

DON CORLEONE

Good.  When you are finished, come

and talk to me.  I have hopes for

you.

DON CORLEONE

(whispered)

Genco, I've brought my sons to pay

their respects.  And look, even

Johnny Fontane, all the way from

Hollywood.

GENCO

Godfather, Godfather, it's your

daughter's wedding day, you cannot

refuse me.  Cure me, you have the

power.

DON CORLEONE

I have no such power...but Genco,

don't fear death.

GENCO

(with a sly wink)

It's been arranged, then?

DON CORLEONE

You blaspheme.  Resign yourself.

GENCO

You need your old Consigliere.  Who

will replace me?

(suddenly)

Stay with me Godfather.  Help me

meet death.  If he sees you, he

will be frightened and leave me in

peace.  You can say a word, pull a

few strings, eh?  We'll outwit that

bastard as we outwitted all those

others.

(clutching his hand)

Godfather, don't betray me.

DON CORLEONE

Luca, I am worried about this man

Sollozzo.  Find out what you can,

through the Tattaglias.  Let them

believe you could be tempted away

from the Corleone Family, if the

right offer was made.  Learn what

he has under his fingernails...

SONNY

It's me, Sonny.

DON CORLEONE

Remember my new Consigliere, a

lawyer with his briefcase can steal

more than a hundred men with guns.

WOLTZ

You should have told me your boss

was Corleone, Tom, I had to check

you out.  I thought you were just

some third rate hustler Johnny was

running in to bluff me.

(a piece of statuary)

Florence, thirteenth century.

Decorated the garden of a king.

WOLTZ

I'm going to show you something

beautiful.

WOLTZ

You like horses?  I like horses, I

love 'em.  Beautiful, expensive

Racehorses.

WOLTZ

Khartoum...Kartoum...You are

looking at six hundred thousand

dollars on four hoofs.  I bet even

Russian Czars never paid that kind

of dough for a single horse.  But

I'm not going to race him I'm going

to put him out to Stud.

HAGEN

Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.

That is very close, a very sacred

religious relationship.

WOLTZ

Okay, but just tell him this is one

favor I can't give.  But he should

try me again on anything else.

HAGEN

He never asks a second favor when

he has been refused the first.

Understood?

WOLTZ

You smooth son of a bitch, let me

lay it on the line for you, and

your boss.  Johnny Fontane never

gets that movie.  I don't care how

many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball

Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

HAGEN

I'm German-Irish.

WOLTZ

Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny

will never get that part because I

hate that pinko punk and I'm going

to run him out of the Movies.  And

I'll tell you why.  He ruined one

of Woltz Brothers' most valuable

proteges.  For five years I had

this girl under training; singing

lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing

lessons!  We spent hundreds of

thousands of dollars--I was going

to make her a star.  I'll be even

more frank, just to show you that

I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it

wasn't all dollars and cents.  That

girl was beautiful and young and

innocent and she was the greatest

piece of ass I've ever ad and I've

had them all over the world.  Then

Johnny comes along with that olive

oil voice and guinea charm and she

runs off.  She threw it all away to

make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN

MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE

MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!

SOLLOZZO

My business is heroin, I have poppy

fields, laboratories in Narseilles

and Sicily, ready to go into

production.  My importing methods

are as safe as these things can be,

about five per cent loss.  The risk

is nothing, the profits enormous.

DON CORLEONE

Why do you come to me?  Why do I

deserve your generosity?

SOLLOZZO

I need two million dollars in

cash...more important, I need a

friend who has people in high

places; a friend who can guarantee

that if one of my employees be

arrested, they would get only light

sentences.  Be my friend.

DON CORLEONE

What percentages for my family?

SOLLOZZO

Thirty per cent.  In the first year

your share would be four million

dollars; then it would go up.

DON CORLEONE

And what is the percentage of the

Tattaglia family?

SOLLOZZO

My compliments.  I'll take care of

them from my share.

DON CORLEONE

So.  I receive 30 per cent just for

finance and legal protection.  No

worries about operations, is that

what you tell me?

SOLLOZZO

If you think two million dollars in

cash is just finance, I congratulate

you Don Corleone.

DON CORLEONE

I said I would see you because I've

heard you're a serious man, to be

treated with respect...

(pause)

But I'll say no to you.

DON CORLEONE

I'll give you my reasons.  I have

many, many friends in Politics.

But they wouldn't be so friendly if

my business was narcotics instead

of gambling.  They think gambling

is something like liquor, a harmless

vice...and they think narcotics is

dirty business.

DON CORLEONE

No...how a man makes his living is

none of my business.  But this

proposition of yours is too risky.

All the people in my family lived

well the last ten years, I won't

risk that out of greed.

SOLLOZZO

Are you worried about security for

your million?

DON CORLEONE

No.

SOLLOZZO

The Tattaglias will guarantee your

investment also.

SONNY

The Tattaglia family guarantees our

investment?

DON CORLEONE

Young people are greedy, and they

have no manners.  They speak when

they should listen.  But I have a

sentimental weakness for my

children, and I've spoiled them, as

you see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my

no is final.

DON CORLEONE

Santino, never let anyone outside

the family know what you are

thinking.  I think your brain is

going soft from all that comedy you

play with that young girl.

DON CORLEONE

What is this nonsense?

HAGEN

It's from Johnny.  It was announced

this morning.  He's going to play

the lead in the new Woltz Brothers

film.

DON CORLEONE

Send Johnny my congratulations.

KAY

We have something for your mother,

for Sonny, we have the tie for

Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the

Reynolds pen...

MICHAEL

And what do you want for Christmas?

KAY

Just you.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony

at the City Hall, no big fuss, no

family, just a couple of friends as

witnesses.

KAY

What will your father say?

MICHAEL

As long as I tell him beforehand he

won't object.  He'll be hurt, but

he won't object.

KAY

What time do they expect us?

MICHAEL

For dinner.  Unless I call and tell

them we're still in New Hampshire.

KAY

Michael.

MICHAEL

Then we can have dinner, see a

show, and spend one more night.

MICHAEL (CONT'D.)

Operator.  Get me

(fill in number)

KAY

Michael, what are you doing?

MICHAEL

Shhh, you be the long distance

operator.  Here.

KAY

Hello...this is Long Distance.  I

have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr.

Michael Corleone.  One moment please.

MICHAEL

Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah...

listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm

driving down to the city with Kay

tomorrow morning.  There's something

important I want to tell the old

man before Christmas.  Will he be

home tomorrow night?

HAGEN (O.S.)

Sure.  Anything I can do for you.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas.

Everyone's going to be out at Long

Beach, right?

HAGEN

Right.

HAGEN

Michael called; he's not leaving

New Hampshire until tomorrow

morning.  I've got to go, I promised

Theresa I'd pick up some toys for

the kids.

DON CORLEONE

Tell Paulie to get the car from the

lot; I'll be ready to go home in a

few minutes.

FREDO

I'll have to get it myself; Paulie

called in sick this morning.

DON CORLEONE

That's the third time this month.

I think maybe you'd better get a

healthier bodyguard for me.  Tell

Tom.

FREDO

(going)

Paulie's a good kid.  If he's sick,

he's sick.  I don't mind getting

the car.

OFFICE MANAGER

Buon Watale, Don Corleone.

DON CORLEONE

Merry Christmas.

(handing the MANAGER

an envelope)

SOLLOZZO

(quietly)

Don't be frightened.  I just want

to talk to you.

SOLLOZZO

(urgently)

Get in; I want to talk to you.

HAGEN

I haven't got time.

SOLLOZZO

Get in the car.  If I wanted to

kill you you'd be dead already.

Trust me.

KAY

Would you like me better if I were

a nun?

MICHAEL

No.

KAY

Would you like me better if I were

Ingrid Bergman?

KAY

(a little voice)

Michael?

MICHAEL

I'm thinking about it.

KAY

Michael...

MICHAEL

No, I would not like you better if

you were Ingrid Bergman.

MICHAEL

(desperately)

They don't say if he's dead or alive.

DON CORLEONE

Fredo, Fredo!

MAN

Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

LUCA

I know.

SOLLOZZO

Do you know who I am?

SOLLOZZO

You've been talking to the

Tattaglias.  They thought we could

do business.

SOLLOZZO

I need somebody strong to protect

my operation, physically.  I've

heard you're not happy with your

family, you might make a switch.

LUCA

If the money is good enough.

SOLLOZZO

On the first shipment, I can

guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.

SONNY

Yeah.

VOICE (O.S.)

Do you recognize my voice?

SONNY

I think so.  Detective squad?

VOICE (O.S.)

Right.  Don't say my name, just

listen.  Somebody shot your father

outside his place fifteen minutes

ago.

SONNY

Is he alive?

VOICE (O.S.)

I think so, but I can't get close

enough.  There's a lot of blood.

I'll try to find out more.

SONNY

Find out anything you can...you got

a Grand coming.

(click)

SONNY

Theresa, let me talk to Tom.  Not

yet?  Have him call me as soon as

he gets home.

SANDRA (O.S.)

Sonny?  Sonny, who is it?

(she enters the room)

What is it?

SONNY

(calmly)

They shot the old man.

SANDRA

Oh God...

SONNY

Honey...don't worry.  Nothing else

is going to happen.

SANDRA

(really frightened)

SONNY?

CLEMENZA

(excited)

You heard about your father?

SONNY

Yeah.

CLEMENZA

The word is out in the streets that

he's dead.

SONNY

Where the hell was Paulie, why

wasn't he with the Don?

CLEMENZA

Paulie's been a little sick all

winter...he was home.

SONNY

How many times did he stay home the

last couple of months?

CLEMENZA

Maybe three, four times.  I always

asked Freddie if he wanted another

bodyguard, but he said no.  Things

have been so smooth the last ten

years...

SONNY

Go get Paulie, I don't care how

sick he is.  Pick him up yourself,

and bring him to my father's house.

CLEMENZA

That's all?  Don't you want me to

send some people over here?

SONNY

No, just you and Paulie.

SONNY

A couple of our people will come to

stay here.  Do whatever they say;

I'm going over to the main house.

If you want me, use Pop's special

phone.

SONNY

Hello.

SOLLOZZO (O.S.)

Santino Corleone?

SONNY

Yeah.

SOLLOZZO (O.S.)

We have Tom Hagen.  In about three

hours he'll be released with our

proposition.  Don't do anything

until you've heard what he has to

say.  You can only cause a lot of

trouble.  What's done is done.

(a pause)

Don't lose that famous temper of

yours.

SONNY

(quietly)

I'll wait.

SONNY

Ma?  Ma, where are you.

SONNY

Ma, I just got a call.  Pop's

hurt...I don't know how bad.

MAMA

(quietly)

Santino?  Have they killed him?

SONNY

(almost in tears)

We don't know yet, Ma.

MAMA

I'll get dressed.  In case we can

see him...

SONNY

Tessio...This is Santino Corleone.

I want fifty reliable men out here.

TESSIO (O.S.)

I heard, Sonny...but what about

Clemenza's regime?

SONNY

I don't want to use Clemenza's

people right now.  Understood?

SONNY

Luca.

SOLLOZZO

I know you're not in the muscle end

of the family--so I don't want you

to be afraid.  I want you to help

the Corleones and I want you to

help me.

SOLLOZZO

Your boss is dead...

SOLLOZZO

(pushing the bottle)

Have some more.  We got him outside

his office, just before I picked

you up.  You have to make the peace

between me and Santino.

SOLLOZZO

Sonny was hot for my deal, right?

You know it's the smart thing to

do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny

into it.

HAGEN

(pulling himself together)

Sonny will come after you with

everything he's got.

SOLLOZZO

That's going to be his first

reaction.  You have to talk some

sense into him.  The Tattaglia

family stands behind me with all

their people.  The other New York

Families will go along with anything

that prevents a full scale war.

SOLLOZZO

The Don was slipping; in the old

days I could never have gotten to

him.  Now he's dead, nothing can

bring him back.  Talk to Sonny,

talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza

and Tessio...it's good business.

HAGEN

Even Sonny won't be able to call

off Luca Brasi.

SOLLOZZO

I'll worry about Luca.  You take

care of Sonny and the other two kids.

HAGEN

I'll try...It's what the Don would

want us to do.

SOLLOZZO

(lifting his hands in

an expression of harmlessness)

Good...then you can go...

(he escorts him to

the door)

I don't like violence.  I'm a

businessman, and blood is a big

expense.

SOLLOZZO

The old man is still alive.  Five

bullets in his Sicilian hide and

he's still alive.

(he gives a fatalistic

shrug)

Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.

MAN

Who're you?

MAN 2

It's the Don's kid; take the car,

I'll bring him inside.

CLEMENZA

Your mother's at the hospital with

the old man: He's gonna pull through.

MICHAEL

Thanks.

MICHAEL

(gently)

You heard from Tom yet?

MICHAEL

(taking her hand)

C'mon.

SONNY

Don't worry, Theresa; they just

want to give Tom the proposition,

then they're going to turn him loose.

SONNY

I was worried when we couldn't get

in touch with you in that hick town.

MICHAEL

How's Mom?

SONNY

Good.  She's been through it before.

Me too.  You were too young to know

about it.  You better wait outside;

there're some things you shouldn't

hear.

MICHAEL

I can help you out...

SONNY

Oh no you can't, the old man'd be

sore as hell if I let you get mixed

up in this.

MICHAEL

Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

SONNY

Theresa.

SONNY

All right, Mikey...who do we have

to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

MICHAEL

What?

SONNY

One of them fingered the old man.

MICHAEL

Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.

SONNY

You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.

It was Paulie.

MICHAEL

How can you be sure?

SONNY

On the three days Paulie was sick

this month, he got calls from a

payphone across from the old man's

building.  We got people in the

phone company.

(he shrugs)

Thank God it was Paulie...we'll

need Clemenza bad.

MICHAEL

Is it going to be all-out war, like

last time?

SONNY

Until the old man tells me different.

MICHAEL

Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.

SONNY

Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't

care what it costs.  I don't care

if we have to fight all the five

families in New York.  The Tattaglia

family's going to eat dirt.  I

don't care if we all go down

together.

MICHAEL

(softly)

That's not how Pop would have

played it.

SONNY

I know I'm not the man he was.  But

I'll tell you this and he'll tell

you too.  When it comes to real

action, I can operate as good as

anybody short range.

MICHAEL

(calmly)

All right, Sonny.  All right.

SONNY

Christ, if I could only contact Luca.

MICHAEL

Is it like they say?  Is he that

good?

HAGEN

If I plead before the Supreme

Court, I'll never do better than I

did tonight with that Turk.

HAGEN

Is the hospital covered?

SONNY

The cops have it locked in and I

got my people there visiting Pop

all the time.  What about the hit

list.

HAGEN

Too much, too far, too personal.

The Don would consider this all

purely a business dispute: Get rid

of Sollozzo, and everything falls

in line.  YOU don't have to go

after the Tattaglias.

HAGEN

What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't

seem worried about Luca.  That

worries me.

SONNY

If Luca sold out we're in real

trouble.

HAGEN

Has anyone been able to get in

touch with him?

SONNY

No, and I've been calling all night.

Maybe he's shacked up.

HAGEN

Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

He always goes home when he's

through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's

number.

HAGEN

Keep trying every fifteen minutes.

(exhausted)

SONNY

Tom, you're the Consigliere, what

do we do if the old man dies?

HAGEN

Without your father's political

contacts and personal influence,

the Corleone family loses half its

strength.  Without your father, the

other New York families might wind

up supporting Sollozzo, and the

Tattaglias just to make sure there

isn't a long destructive war.  The

old days are over, this is 1946;

nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If

your father dies...make the deal,

Sonny.

SONNY

(angry)

That's easy to say; it's not your

father.

HAGEN

(quietly)

I was as good a son to him as you

or Mike.

SONNY

Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it

that way.

HAGEN

We're all tired...

SONNY

OK, we sit tight until the old man

can give us the lead.  But Tom, I

want you to stay inside the Mall.

You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio,

you hold your people in reserve,

but have them nosing around the

city.  The hospital is yours; I

want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours

a day.

SONNY

What is it?

CLEMENZA

I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...

PAULIE

The guy at the gate's outside...says

there's a package...

SONNY

Tessio, see what it is.

PAULIE

You want me to hang around?

SONNY

Yeah.  Hang around.

PAULIE

Outside?

CLEMENZA

Outside.

PAULIE

Sure.

SONNY

Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie.

I don't ever want to see him again.

Understood?

CLEMENZA

Understood.

SONNY

Okay, now you can move your men

into the Mall, replace Tessio's

people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a

couple of Clemenza's people and go

to Luca's apartment and wait for

him to show.  That crazy bastard

might be going after Sollozzo right

now if he's heard the news.

HAGEN

Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up

in this so directly.  You know the

old man doesn't want that.

SONNY

OK forget it, just stay on the phone.

CLEMENZA

A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi

sleeps with the fishes.

BRUNO

(making an ugly face)

Oh Christ...all over the floor.

SOLLOZZO

The Godfather is next.

LAMPONE

Nice.

CLEMENZA

Crazy Detroit delivered it with a

wooden bumper.  They're going to

send me the chrome bumpers in a

couple months.  I waited two years

for this car to come with wooden

bumpers!

CLEMENZA

Today you make your bones on Paulie.

You understand everything?

LAMPONE

Sure.

CLEMENZA

.22 soft-nosed load.  Accurate up

to five feet.

PAULIE

Rocco, sit on the other side.  A

big guy like you blocks my rearview

mirror.

CLEMENZA

Goddamn Sonny.  He's running scared.

He's already thinking of going to

the mattresses.  We have to find a

place on the West Side.  Paulie,

you know a good location?

PAULIE

I'll think about it.

CLEMENZA

(grunting)

Drive while you thinking; I wanna

get to the City this month!

CLEMENZA

Pay attention!

PAULIE

Good for ten men...

CLEMENZA

OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm

suppose to call when I found

somethin'.

CLEMENZA

You wait; I'll call.

CLEMENZA

He talked my ear off.  Want us to

go back to Long Beach; have another

job for us.  Rocco, you live in the

City, can we drop you off?

LAMPONE (O.S.)

Ah, I left my car at your place.

CLEMENZA

OK, then you gotta come back.

PAULIE

You think we'll go for that last

place?

CLEMENZA

Maybe, or you gotta know now.

PAULIE

Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

CLEMENZA

Paulie, pull over.  I gotta take a

leak.

CLEMENZA

Leave the gun.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)

Mike.  Hey Mikey; telephone.

CLEMENZA

Some dame.

MICHAEL

Hello.  Kay?

KAY (O.S.)

How is your father?

MICHAEL

He'll be OK.

KAY (O.S.)

(pause)

I love you.

KAY (O.S.)

I LOVE YOU.

MICHAEL

Yeah Kay, I'm here.

KAY (O.S.)

Can you say it?

MICHAEL

Huh?

KAY (O.S.)

Tell me you love me.

MICHAEL

I can't...

KAY (O.S.)

Please say it.

MICHAEL

Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?

KAY (O.S.)

OK.

(click)

CLEMENZA

How come you don't tell that nice

girl you love her...here, learn

something... you may have to feed

fifty guys some day.  You start

with olive oil...fry some garlic,

see.  And then fry some sausage...or meat

balls if you like...then you throw

in the tomatoes, the tomato

paste...some basil; and a little

red wine...that's my trick.

SONNY

You take care of Paulie?

CLEMENZA

You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's

sick for good this winter.

SONNY

Where are you going?

MICHAEL

To the city.

SONNY

(to Clemenza; dipping

bread into the sauce)

Send some bodyguards.

MICHAEL

I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just

going to see Pop in the hospital.

Also, I got other things.

CLEMENZA

Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

SONNY

OK, but be careful.

MICHAEL

Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.

I'll just sit with him; I want to

show respect.

KAY

Can I go to the hospital with you?

MICHAEL

I don't think so.  You don't want

to end up on page 3 of the Daily

News.

KAY

My parents don't read the Daily

News.  All right, if you think I

shouldn't.  I can't believe the

things the papers are printing.

I'm sure most of it's not true.

MICHAEL

I don't think so either.

(silence)

I better go.

KAY

When will I see you again?

MICHAEL

I want you to go back to New

Hampshire...think things over.

KAY

When will I see you again?

MICHAEL

Goodbye.

KAY

Goodbye.

MICHAEL

Hello?  Hello?

VOICE (O.S.)

What are you doing here?

NURSE

You're not supposed to be here now.

MICHAEL

I'm Michael Corleone--this is my

father.  What happened to the

detectives who were guarding him?

NURSE

Oh your father just had too many

visitors.  It interfered with the

hospital service.  The police came

and made them all leave just ten

minutes ago.

(comfortingly)

But don't worry.  I look in on him.

MICHAEL

You just stand here one minute...

MICHAEL

Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm

down at the hospital.  I came down

late.  There's no one here.  None

of Tessio's people--no detectives,

no one.  The old man is completely

unprotected.

SONNY (O.S.)

All right, get him in a different

room; lock the door from the inside.

I'll have some men there inside of

fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and

don't panic.

MICHAEL

(furiously, but kept inside)

I won't panic.

NURSE

You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

MICHAEL

(coldly)

You and I are going to move my

father right now...to another room

on another floor...Can you

disconnect those tubes so we can

wheel the bed out?

NURSE

Absolutely not!  We have to get

permission from the Doctor.

MICHAEL

You've read about my father in the

papers.  You've seen that no one's

here to guard him.  Now I've just

gotten word that men are coming to

this hospital to kill him.  Believe

me and help me.

NURSE

(frightened)

We don't have to disconnect them,

we can wheel the stand with the bed.

MICHAEL

Hurry, into there.

MICHAEL

(stepping out)

Who is it?

ENZO

Michael...do you remember me, Enzo,

the baker's helper to Nazorine, now

his son-in-law.

MICHAEL

Enzo, get out of here.  There's

going to be trouble.

ENZO

If there...will be trouble...I stay

with you, to help.  I owe it to the

Godfather.

MICHAEL

Go outside; stand in front...I'll

be out in a minute.

NURSE

(frightened)

He's awake.

MICHAEL

Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh,

don't try to speak.  There are men

who are coming to try to kill you.

But I'm with you...I'm with you

now...

MICHAEL

Get rid of those and look like

you've got a gun in your pocket.

MICHAEL

Listen...

MCCLUSKEY

I thought I got all you guinea

hoods locked up.  Who the hell are

you and what are you doing here?

COP

He's clean, Captain.

MICHAEL

(quietly)

What happened to the detectives who

were supposed to be guarding my

father?

MCCLUSKEY

(furious)

You punk-hood.  Who the hell are

you to tell me my business.  I

pulled them off.  I don't care how

many Dago gangsters kill each other.

I wouldn't lift a finger to keep

your old man from getting knocked

off.  Now get the hell out of here;

get off this street you punk, and

stay away from this hospital.

MICHAEL

I'll stay until you put guards

around my father's room.

MCCLUSKEY

Phil, lock this punk up.

A DETECTIVE

The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a

war hero, and he's never been mixed

up in the rackets...

MCCLUSKEY

(furious)

Goddam it, I said lock him up.  Put

the cuffs on him.

MICHAEL

(deliberately, right

to McCLUSKEY's face,

as he's being handcuffed)

How much is the Turk paying you to

set my father up, Captain?

MICHAEL

Christ, Sonny really means business.

CLEMENZA

How come all the new men?

TESSIO

We'll need them now.  After the

hospital incident, Sonny got mad.

We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock

this morning.

SONNY

I've got a hundred button men on

the streets twenty-four hours a day.

If Sollozzo shows one hair on his

ass he's dead.

SONNY

Mikey, you look beautiful!

MICHAEL

Cut it out.

SONNY

The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve

of that son of a bitch!  After he

craps out last night he wants a meet.

HAGEN

Was there a definite proposal?

SONNY

Sure, he wants us to send Mike to

meet him to hear his proposition.

The promise is the deal will be so

good we can't refuse.

HAGEN

What about that Tattaglias?  What

will they do about Bruno?

SONNY

Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out

what they did to my father.

HAGEN

We should hear what they have to say.

SONNY

No, no Consiglere.  Not this time.

No more meetings, no more

discussions, no more Sollozzo

tricks.  Give them one message: I

WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all

out war.  We go to the mattresses

and we put all the button men out

on the street.

HAGEN

The other families won't sit still

for all out war.

SONNY

Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.

HAGEN

Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't

want to hear this.  This is not a

personal thing, this is Business.

SONNY

And when they shot me father...

HAGEN

Yes, even the shooting of your

father was business, not personal...

SONNY

No no, no more advice on how to

patch it up Tom.  You just help me

win.  Understood?

HAGEN

I found out about this Captain

McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.

He's definitely on Sollozzo's

payroll, and for big money.

McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's

bodyguard.  What you have to

understand is that while Sollozzo

is guarded like this, he's

invulnerable.  Nobody has ever

gunned down a New York Police

Captain.  Never.  It would be

disastrous.  All the five families

would come after you Sonny; the

Corleone family would be outcasts;

even the old man's political

protection would run for cover.  So

just...take that into consideration.

SONNY

(still fuming)

McCluskey can't stay with the Turk

forever.  We'll wait.

MICHAEL

We can't wait.  No matter what

Sollozzo say about a deal, he's

figuring out how to kill Pop.  You

have to get Sollozzo now.

SONNY

The kid's right.

HAGEN

What about McCluskey?

MICHAEL

Let's say now that we have to kill

McCluskey.  We'll clear that up

through our Newspaper contacts later.

SONNY

Go on Mike.

MICHAEL

They want me to go to the conference

with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting

for two days from now.  Sonny, get

our informers to find out where the

meeting will be held.

Insist it has to be a public place:

a bar or restaurant at the height

of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel

safe.  They'll check me when I meet

them so I won't be able to carry a

weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a

way to have one planted there for

me.

(pause)

Then I'll kill them both.

SONNY

You?  You, the high-class college

kid.  You never wanted to get mixed

up in the family business.  Now you

wanta gun down a police Captain and

the Turk just because you got

slapped in the face.  You're taking

it personal, it's just business and

he's taking it personal.

MICHAEL

(angrily, but cold)

Sonny, it's all personal, and I

learned it from him, the old man,

the Godfather.  He took my joining

the Marines personal.  I take

Sollozzo trying to kill my father

personal, and you know I'll kill

them Sonny.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)

It's as cold as they come,

impossible to trace.

(he turns it upside down)

Don't worry about prints Mike, I

put a special tape on the trigger

and butt.  Here.

(he hands the gun to

another pair of hands)

Whatsamatter?  Trigger too tight.

(it fires: very LOUD)

I left it noisy, so it'll scare any

pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander

away.

CLEMENZA

Just let your hand drop to your

side, and let the gun slip out.

Everybody will still think you got

it.  They'll be starin' at your

face, see?  Then walk out of the

place real fast, but don't run.

Don't look anybody directly in the

eye, but don't look away from them

neither.  Hey, they'll be scared

stiff o you, believe me.  Nobody's

gonna bother with you.  Don't worry

about nothing; you'd be surprised

how good these things go.  O.K.,

put your hat on, let's see how you

look.  Helps with identification.

CLEMENZA

Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse

to change their identification when

we make them see the light.  Then

you take a long vacation and we

catch the hell.

MICHAEL

How bad will it be?

CLEMENZA

Probably all the other families

will line up against us.  But, it's

alright.  These things have to

happen once every ten years or

so...gets rid of the bad blood.

You gotta stop 'em at the beginning.

Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at

Munich, they shoulda never let him

get away with that, they were just

asking for big trouble...

MICHAEL

Why don't you stop living like a

bum and get this place cleaned up.

SONNY

What are you, inspecting the

barracks?

(SONNY sits up with

his head in his hands)

You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you

be sure to drop the gun right away?

MICHAEL

A million times.

SONNY

Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to

pick you up in an hour and a half

on Times Square, under the big

Camels sign.

HAGEN

We don't let Mike go until we have

the hostage, Sonny.

CLEMENZA

It's okay...the hostage is outside

playing pinochle with three of my

men.

SONNY

That could be a Tattaglia informer

with the meeting place.

SONNY

One of Tattaglia's people?

HAGEN

No.  Our informer in McCluskey's

precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he

signed out for Louis' Restaurant in

the Bronx.  Anyone know it.

TESSIO

Sure, I do.  It's perfect for us.

A small family place with big

booths where people can talk in

private.  Good food.  Everybody

minds their business.  Perfect.

(he moves to the desk

and makes a crude drawing)

This is the entrance, Mike.  When

you finish just walk out and turn

left, then turn the corner.

Clemenza, you gotta work fast to

plant the gun.  They got an old-

fashioned toilet with a space

between the water container and the

wall.  We can tape the gun behind

there.

CLEMENZA

Mike, they're gonna frisk you in

the car.  You'll be clean so they

won't worry 'bout nothing.  In the

restaurant, wait and talk a while,

and then ask permission to go.  See?

Then when you come out, don't waste

time; don't sit down...you come out

blasting.  And don't take chances.

In the head, two shots apiece.  And

out as fast as your legs can move.

SONNY

I want somebody very good, very

safe to plant that gun.  I don't

want my brother coming out of that

toilet with just his dick in his

hand.

CLEMENZA

The gun will be there.

SONNY

(to MICHAEL, warmly)

You're on, kid...I'll square it

with Mom your not seeing her before

you left.  And I'll get a message

to your girl friend when I think

the time is right.

CLEMENZA

We gotta move...

MICHAEL

O.K.  How long do you think before

I can come back?

SONNY

Probably a year...

HAGEN

(starting to crack)

Jesus, I don't know...

SONNY

Can you do it Mike?

DRIVER

Get in, Mike.

SOLLOZZO

I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we

can straighten everything out.  All

this is terrible, it's not the way

I wanted things to happen at all.

It should never have happened.

MICHAEL

I want to settle things tonight.  I

want my father left alone.

SOLLOZZO

He won't be; I swear to you be my

children he won't be.  Just keep an

open mind when we talk.  I hope

you're not a hothead like your

brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to

talk business with him.

MCCLUSKEY

He's a good kid.  He's all right.

Turn around, up on your knees,

facing me.

MCCLUSKEY

I'm sorry about the other night

Mike.  I'm getting too old for my

job, too grouchy.  Can't stand the

aggravation.  You know how it is.

He's clean.

MICHAEL

We're going to New Jersey?

SOLLOZZO

(sly)

Maybe.

SOLLOZZO

Nice work; I'll remember it.

MCCLUSKEY

Is the Italian food good here?

SOLLOZZO

Try the veal; it's the finest in

New York.

SOLLOZZO

I am going to talk Italian to Mike.

MCCLUSKEY

Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll

concentrate on my veal and my

spaghetti.

MICHAEL

(using English for emphasis)

Most important...I want a sure

guarantee that no more attempts

will be made on my father's life.

SOLLOZZO

What guarantees can I give you?  I

am the hunted one.  I've missed my

chance.  You think too highly of

me, my friend...I am not so

clever...all I want if a truce...

SOLLOZZO

What is it?

MICHAEL

Is it all right if I go to the

bathroom?

MCCLUSKEY

I frisked him; I've frisked

thousands of young punks; he's clean.

SOLLOZZO

Don't take too long.

MICHAEL

Now I can talk.  I feel much better.

MAN

Nice Augie...nice.

DRIVER

Pick up your sister?

SONNY

Yeah.

CONNIE'S VOICE

Who is it?

SONNY

It's me, Sonny.

SONNY

(tenderly)

Connie, what is it?

CONNIE

(desperately)

It was my fault!  I started a fight

with him and I tried to hit him so

he hit me.  He didn't even try to

hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.

SONNY

I'm goin' to have the doctor come

over and take a look at you.

CONNIE

Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.

Please don't.

SONNY

Hey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do?

Make your kid a orphan before he's

born.

SONNY

You...bastard...You...hurt my

sister... again...and I'll

kill...you.

HAGEN

Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You

should call...

KAY

I've tried calling and writing.  I

want to reach Michael.

HAGEN

Nobody knows where he is.  We know

he's all right, but that's all.

KAY

What was that?

HAGEN

An accident.  No one was hurt.

KAY

Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I

come in to call another one?

HAGEN

Sure...I'm sorry.

KAY

Will you give this to him.

HAGEN

If I accept that letter and you

told a Court of Law I accepted it,

they would interpret it as my

having knowledge of his whereabouts.

Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.

MAMA

You're Mikey's little girl.

MAMA

You eat anything?

MAMA

(to HAGEN)

Disgrazia, you don't even give the

poor girl a cup of coffee?

KAY

Will you give this letter to Michael.

HAGEN

Mama, no.

MAMA

You tell me what to do?  Even he

don't tell me what to do.

KAY

Why did they blame Michael?

MAMA

You listen to me, you go home to

your family, and you find a good

young man and get married.  Forget

about Mikey; he's no good for you,

anymore.

CONNIE

What's the matter, Carlo?

CARLO

Shut up.

HAGEN

...since McCluskey's killing, the

police have cracked down on most of

our operations...on the other

families too.  There's been a lot

of bad blood.

SONNY

Pop, they hit us and we hit them

back.

HAGEN

We put out a lot of material

through our contacts in the

Newspapers...about McCluskey's

being tied up with Sollozzo in the

Drug Rackets...things are starting

to loosen up.

SONNY

Freddie's gonna go to Las

Vegas...under the protection of Don

Francesco of L.A.  I want him to

rest...

FREDO

I'm goin' to learn the casino

business.

HAGEN

Michael...

(he takes a breath)

It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

HAGEN

He's safe now...we're already

working on ways to bring him back.

SONNY

We'll let the old man take it easy

for a couple of weeks.  I want to

get things going good before he

gets better.  What's the matter

with you?

HAGEN

You start operating, the five

families will start their raids

again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny,

your war is costing us a lot of

money.

SONNY

No more stalemate Tom, we got the

soldiers, we'll match them gun for

gun if that's how they want it.

They know me for what I am, Tom--

and they're scared of me.

HAGEN

Yes.  That's true, you're getting a

hell of a reputation.

SONNY

Well it's war!  We might not be in

this shape if we had a real war-

time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop

had Genco, who do I have?

(TOM starts to leave)

Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday,

we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be

sore.

CONNIE

Who is this?

GIRL (O.S.)

(giggle)

I'm a friend of Carlo's.  I just

wanted to tell him I can't see him

tonight; I have to go out of town.

CONNIE

You lousy tramp bitch.

(click)

CARLO

What was that?

CONNIE

Your girl friend.  She says she

can't make it tonight.  You lousy

bastard you have the nerve to give

your whores my telephone number.

I'll kill you, you bastard!

CARLO

(defending himself)

You're crazy.  She was kidding

around; I don't know, some nut.

CONNIE

You're staying home.  You're not

going out.

CARLO

OK, OK.  You gonna make me something

to eat at least?

CONNIE

The food is on the table.

CARLO

I'm not hungry yet.

CONNIE

Eat it, it's on the table.

CARLO

Ba Fa Goulle.

CONNIE

BA FA GOULE YOU!

CARLO

You filthy guinea spoiled brat.

Clean it up or I'll kick your head

in.

CONNIE

Like hell I will.

CARLO

Clean it up!

CARLO

Even the female Corleones are

murderers.

CONNIE

The baby!  The baby!

CARLO

You're fat as a pig.

CONNIE

Mama...mama, it's Connie.  Mama, I

can't talk any louder.  No, I don't

want to talk to Sonny.

SONNY

Yeah Connie.

CONNIE (O.S.)

Sonny, just send a car to bring me

home.  I'll tell you then, it's

nothing Sonny, don't you come.

Send TOM, please Sonny, it's

nothing; I just want to come home.

SONNY

(in a controlled voice)

You wait there.  You just wait there.

SONNY

(quietly)

That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...

HAGEN

Go after him.

HAGEN (O.S.)

This is Tom Hagen.  I'm calling for

Don Corleone, at his request.

BONASERA

Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.

HAGEN (O.S.)

You owe the Don a service.  In one

hour, not before, perhaps later, he

will be at your funeral parlor to

ask for your help.  Be there to

greet him.  If you have any

objections speak now, and I'll

inform him.

BONASERA

Anything...Anything the Godfather

wishes.

HAGEN (O.S.)

Good.  He never doubted you.

BONASERA

The Don himself is coming to me

tonight?

HAGEN (O.S.)

Yes.

(click)

BONASERA

For the last year, they have been

killing one another.  So now, what?

Your Godfather comes to me...Why?

(whispering, slyly)

They've killed someone so important

that they wish to make his body

disappear.

MRS. BONASERA

(frightened)

Amerigo!

BONASERA

They could make me an accomplice to

their murder.  They could send me

to jail!

BONASERA

And if the other families find

out...they will make me their enemy.

They could come here to our house.

I curse the day I ever went to the

Godfather.

DON CORLEONE

Well my friend, are you ready to do

me this service?

BONASERA

What do you wish me to do?

DON CORLEONE

(staring at the table)

I want you to use all your powers,

all your skill, as you love me.  I

do not want his mother to see him

as he is.

HAGEN

(quietly)

OK.  Go to Clemenza's house and

tell him to come here right away.

He'll tell you what to do.

DON CORLEONE

Give me a drop of anisette.

DON CORLEONE

My wife was weeping before she fell

asleep, outside my window I saw my

caporegimes to the house, and it is

midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine,

I think you should tell your Don

what everyone knows.

HAGEN

(quietly)

I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was

about to come up and wake you and

tell you.  Just now.

DON CORLEONE

But you needed a drink first.

HAGEN

Yes.

DON CORLEONE

Now you've had your drink.

HAGEN

They shot Sonny on the Causeway.

(pause)

He's dead.

DON CORLEONE

I want no inquiries made.  No acts

of vengeance.

(pause)

Consigliere, arrange a meeting with

the heads of the five

families...this war stops now.

DON CORLEONE

Call Bonasera...he will do me a

service.

HAGEN

This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for

Don Corleone, at his request.

BONASERA (O.S.)

Yes, I understand I'm listening.

HAGEN

You owe the Don a service.  He has

no doubt that you will repay it.

DON CORLEONE (O.S.)

I want to thank you all for coming.

I consider it a service done to me

personally and I am in the debt of

each and every one of you.

Especially those of you who have

traveled from such distances as

California, St. Louis, Kansas City;

and New Orleans...

DON CORLEONE

Ah well, let's get down to business.

We are all honorable men here, we

don't have to give assurances as if

we were lawyers.

(he sits, gazes out

at them, and sighs)

How did things ever go so far?

Well, no matter.  A lot of

foolishness has come to pass.  It

was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

DON CORLEONE

Tattaglia has lost a son; I have

lost a son.  We are quits.  Let

there be a peace...

(he gestures

expressively,

submissively, with

his hands)

That is all I want...

BARZINI

Don Corleone is too modest.  He had

the judges and politicians in his

pocket and he refused to share them.

His refusal is not the act of a

friend.  He takes the bread out of

the mouths of our families.  Times

have changed, it's not like the old

days where everyone can go his own

way.  If Don Corleone had all the

judges and politicians in New York,

then he must share them or let

others use them.  Certainly he can

present a bill for such services,

we're not Communists, after all.

But he has to let us draw water

from the well.  It's that simple.

DON CORLEONE

My friends, I didn't refuse out of

malice.  You all know me.  When

have I ever refused an accommodation?

But why, this time?  Because I

think this drug business will

destroy us in the years to come.

It's not like whiskey or gambling

or even women which most people

want and is forbidden them by the

pezzonovante of the Church and the

Government.  But drugs?  No.  Even

policemen, who help us in gambling

and other things would refuse to

help us in drugs.  But...I am

willing to do whatever all of you

think is necessary.

DON ZALUCHI

I don't believe in drugs.  For

years I paid my people extra so

they wouldn't do that kind of

business...$200 a week.  But it

didn't matter.  Somebody comes to

them and says, "I have powders, if

you put up three, four thousand

dollar investment, we can make

fifty thousand distributing."  Who

can resist such a profit?

There's no way to control it, as a

business...to keep it respectable.

(rapping the table)

I don't want it near schools!  I

don't want it sold to children.

That is an infamita.

(thinking)

In my city I would try to keep the

traffic in the dark people, the

colored.  They are the best

customers, the least troublesome,

and they are animals anyway.  They

have no respect for their wives or

their families or themselves.  Let

them lose their souls with drugs.

But something has to be done, we

can't have everybody running around

doing just what they please, like a

bunch of anarchists.

BARZINI

Then, are we agreed; the traffic in

drugs will be permitted, but

controlled; and Don Corleone agrees

to give it protection in the East.

BARZINI

That's the whole matter then, we

have the peace, and let me pay my

respects to Don Corleone, whom we

have all known over the years as a

man of his word.

(noticing TATTAGLIA

is uneasy)

Don Philip?

TATTAGLIA

I agree to everything here, I'm

willing to forget my own misfortune.

But I must hear strict assurance

from Corleone.  When time goes by

and his position becomes stronger,

will he attempt any individual

vengeance?

DON CORLEONE

I forego my vengeance for my dead

son, for the common good.  But I

have selfish reasons.  My youngest

son had to flee, accused of

Sollozzo's murder, and I must now

make arrangements so that he can

come home with safety, cleared of

all those false charges.  That is

my affair, and I will make those

arrangements.

(with strength)

But I am a superstitious man...and

so if some unlucky accident should

befall my youngest son, if some

police officer should accidentally

shoot him, or if he should hang

himself in his cell, or if my son

is struck by a bolt of lightning,

then I will blame some of the

people here.  That, I could never

forgive, but...aside from that, let

me swear by the souls of my

Grandchildren that I will never be

the one to break the peace we have

made.

HAGEN

When I meet with Tattaglia's

people; should I insist that all

his drug middle-men be clean?

DON CORLEONE

Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini

is a man who will know that without

being told.

HAGEN

You mean Tattaglia.

DON CORLEONE

(shaking his head)

Barzini.

HAGEN

(a revelation)

He was the one behind Sollozzo?

DON CORLEONE

Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could

never have outfought Santino.  But

I wasn't sure until this day.  No,

it was Barzini all along.

MICHAEL

Don Tommassino.

DON TOMMASSINO

Michael, why must you do this.  We

have been lucky so far, all these

months you've been here we've kept

your name a secret.  It is from

love for your father that I've

asked you never to more than an

hour from the Villa.

MICHAEL

Calo and Fabrizzio are with me;

nothing will happen.

DON TOMMASSINO

You must understand that your

Father's enemies have friends in

Palermo.

MICHAEL

I know.

DON TOMMASSINO

Where are you going?

MICHAEL

Corleone.

DON TOMMASSINO

There is nothing there.  Not anymore.

MICHAEL

I was told that my Grandfather was

murdered on its main street; and

his murderers came to kill my

father there when he was twelve

years old.

DON TOMMASSINO

Long ago.  Now there is nothing:

the men killed each other in family

vendettas...the others escaped to

America.

MICHAEL

Don Tommassino...I should see this

place.

DON TOMMASSINO

That is your birthright...but

Michael, use this car.

MICHAEL

No...I would like to walk to

Corleone.

DON TOMMASSINO

Be careful Michael, don't let them

know your name.

FABRIZZIO

You tell us about America.

MICHAEL

How do you know I come from America?

FABRIZZIO

We hear.  We were told you were a

Pezzonovanta...big shot.

MICHAEL

Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.

FABRIZZIO

Hey America!  Is she as rich as

they say?

MICHAEL

Yes.

FABRIZZIO

Take me to America!  You need a

good lupara in America?

(pats his shotgun)

You take me, I'll be the best man

you got.  "Oh say, can you

seeee...By da star early light..."

FABRIZZIO

America.

Hey America!

Take me with you!

Hey, take me to America G.I.!

CALO

Corleone.

CALO

The names of the dead.

FABRIZZIO

(calling out to them)

Hey, beautiful girls!

MICHAEL

(sternly)

Shhhhh.

FABRIZZIO

(murmuring)

Jesus Christ, take my soul.  I'm

dying.

FABRIZZIO

You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?

CALO

Easy man.

MICHAEL

What are you talking about?

FABRIZZIO

You can't hide it when you're hit

by the thunderbolt.

FABRIZZIO

You know all the girls in this

town, eh?  We saw some beauties

coming down the road.  One in

particular got our friend hit with

the Thunderbolt...

(he indicates MICHAEL)

VITELLI

You had better bring a few bottles

home with you, my friend; you'll

need help sleeping tonight.

(he laughs)

FABRIZZIO

This one could seduce the devil.  A

body! and eyes as big and black as

olives.

VITELLI

(laughing with

them...pouring more wine)

I know about what you mean!

FABRIZZIO

This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?

VITELLI

(laughing)

Beautiful all over, eh?

FABRIZZIO

And hair.  Black and curly, like a

doll.  And such a mouth.

VITELLI

Yes, we have beautiful girls here...

but virtuous.

MICHAEL

She wore a red dress, and a red

ribbon in her hair.  She looks more

Greek than Italian.  Do you know a

beauty like that?

VITELLI

No.

FABRIZZIO

God in Heaven, I think I

understand...

FABRIZZIO

Let's get out of here; he's boiling

up his blood to do us mischief.

It's his daughter.

CALO

Come quickly.

MICHAEL

Innkeeper.  More wine!

FABRIZZIO

(whispered)

The old bastard mentioned two sons

he only has to whistle up.

MICHAEL

Tell him to come to me.

MICHAEL

(quietly)

I understand I've offended you by

talking about your daughter.  I

offer you my apologies, I'm a

stranger in this country, I don't

know the customs very well.  Let me

say this, I meant no disrespect to

you or her...

VITELLI

(shrugs)

Who are you and what do you want

from my daughter?

MICHAEL

I am an American hiding in Sicily

from the police of my country.  My

name is Michael.  You can inform

the police and make your fortune

but then your daughter would lose a

father rather than gain a husband.

In any case, I want to meet your

daughter.  With your permission and

under the supervision of your

family.  With all decorum.  With

all respect.  I am an honorable man.

VITELLI

Are you a friend of the friends?

MICHAEL

When the proper time comes, I'll

tell you everything that a wife's

father should know.

FABRIZZIO

It's the real Thunderbolt, then.

VITELLI

(formally)

Come Sunday morning:  My name is

Vitelli and my house is up there on

the hill, above the village.

MICHAEL

Your daughter's name?

VITELLI

Appolonia.

APPOLONIA

Grazia.

MICHAEL

It's safer to teach you English.

APPOLONIA

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

Thursday, Friday...See, I learned

it.  Now teach me to drive!

MICHAEL

Ciao, Don Tommassino.

MICHAEL

Things went badly in Palermo?

DON TOMMASSINO

The younger men have no respect.

Things are changing; I don't know

what will happen.  Michael, because

of the wedding, people now know

your name.

MICHAEL

Is that why there are more men on

the walls?

DON TOMMASSINO

Even so, I don't think it is safe

here anymore.  I've made plans to

move you to a villa near Siracuse.

You must go right away.

MICHAEL

What is it?

DON TOMMASSINO

Bad news from America.  Your

brother, Santino.  He has been

killed.

MICHAEL

Get the car.  I'll be leaving in

ten minutes.  Where's Calo?

FABRIZZIO

Calo is having a cup of coffee in

the kitchen.  Is your wife coming

with you?

MICHAEL

No, she's going home to her family.

She'll join me in a few weeks...

CALO

Should I get your bag?

MICHAEL

No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia?

CALO

(smiling)

She is sitting in the driver's seat

of the car, dying to step on the

gas.  She'll be a real American

woman before she gets to America.

MICHAEL

Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in

the car.

MICHAEL

(muttering to himself)

Where the hell is he going?

APPOLONIA

(calling out)

I'll drive to you.

MICHAEL

No.  No!

MICHAEL

Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know

that the one who gives me Fabrizzio

will own the finest pastures in

Sicily.

DON CORLEONE

Be my son...

DON CORLEONE

This old building has seen its day.

No way to do business...too small,

too old.

DON CORLEONE

Have you thought about a wife?  A

family?

MICHAEL

(pained)

No.

DON CORLEONE

I understand, Michael.  But you

must make a family, you know.

MICHAEL

I want children, I want a family.

But I don't know when.

DON CORLEONE

Accept what's happened, Michael.

MICHAEL

I could accept everything that's

happened; I could accept it, but

that I never had a choice.  From

the time I was born, you had laid

this all out for me.

DON CORLEONE

No, I wanted other things for you.

MICHAEL

You wanted me to be your son.

DON CORLEONE

Yes, but sons who would be

professors, scientists,

musicians...and grandchildren who

could be, who knows, a Governor, a

President even, nothing's impossible

here in America.

MICHAEL

Then why have I become a man like

you?

DON CORLEONE

You are like me, we refuse to be

fools, to be puppets dancing on a

string pulled by other men.  I

hoped the time for guns and killing

and massacres was over.  That was

my misfortune.  That was your

misfortune.  I was hunted on the

streets of Corleone when I was

twelve years old because of who my

father was.  I had no choice.

MICHAEL

A man has to choose what he will be.

I believe that.

DON CORLEONE

What else do you believe in?

DON CORLEONE

Believe in a family.  Can you

believe in your country?  Those

Pezzonovante of the State who

decide what we shall do with our

lives?  Who declare wars they wish

us to fight in to protect what they

own.  Do you put your fate in the

hands of men whose only talent is

that they tricked a bloc of people

to vote for them?  Michael, in five

years the Corleone family can be

completely legitimate.  Very

difficult things have to happen to

make that possible.  I can't do

them anymore, but you can, if you

choose to.

DON CORLEONE

Believe in a family; believe in a

Code of Honor, older and higher,

believe in Roots that go back

thousands of years into your Race.

Make a family, Michael, and protect

it.  These are our affairs, sono cosa

nostra, Governments only protect

men who have their own individual

power.  Be one of those men...you

have the choice.

FREDO (O.S.)

There's a new one.  Construction

going on everywhere.

FREDO (O.S.)

That's one of the family's new ones.

Not bad, eh?

MICHAEL

Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the

airport?

FREDO

He had business at the hotel, but

he'll drop in for dinner.

FREDO

You look wonderful, kid; really

wonderful.  That doctor did some

job on your face.

MICHAEL

You look good, too.

FREDO

Nice, eh?

FREDO

(hurrying into the bedroom)

Kid, take a look-see.

FREDO

Ever seen anything like that before?

MICHAEL

(dryly)

No.

FREDO

Mike!  The party starting!

MICHAEL

Come here a minute, Fredo.

MICHAEL

Who are those girls?

FREDO

(jokingly)

That's for you to find out.

MICHAEL

Give them some money and send them

home.

FREDO

Mike!

MICHAEL

Get rid of them...

MICHAEL

Johnny, the Corleone family is

thinking of selling out all our

interests in the Olive Oil business

and settling here.  Moe Greene will

sell us his interest so it can be

wholly owned by friends of the

family.

FREDO

Mike, you sure about Moe selling.

He never mentioned it to me and he

loves the business.

MICHAEL

I'll make him an offer he can't

refuse.

MICHAEL

Johnny, the Don wants you to help

us get started.  We figure

entertainment will be the big

factor in drawing gamblers.  We

hope you'll sign a contract to

appear five times a year for maybe

a week long engagement.

We hope your friends in the movies

will do the same.  We count on you

to convince them.

JOHNNY

Sure, I'll do anything for my

Godfather.  You know that, Mike.

MOE

Mike, good to see you.  Got

everything you want?

MICHAEL

Thanks.

MOE

The chef cooked for you special;

the dancers will kick your tongue

out and you credit is good!

(to his BODYGUARDS)

Draw chips for all these people so

they can play on the house.

MICHAEL

Is my credit good enough to buy you

out?

MOE

Buy me out?...

MICHAEL

The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone

family wants to buy you out.

MOE

(furious)

The Corleone family wants to buy me

out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy

me out.

MICHAEL

Your casino loses money.  Maybe we

can do better.

MOE

You think I scam?

MICHAEL

(the worst insult)

You're unlucky.

MOE

You goddamn dagos.  I do you a

favor and take Freddie in when

you're having a bad time, and then

you try to push me out.

MICHAEL

You took Freddie in because the

Corleone family bankrolled your

casino.  You and the Corleone

family are evened out.  This is for

business; name your price.

MOE

The Corleone family don't have that

kind of muscle anymore.  The

Godfather is sick.  You're getting

chased out of New York by Barzini

and the other families, and you

think you can find easier pickings

here.  I've talked to Barzini; I

can make a deal with him and keep

my hotel!

MICHAEL

(quietly, deadly)

Is that why you thought you could

slap Freddie around in public?

FREDO

(his face turns red)

Ah Mike, that was nothing.  Moe

didn't mean anything.  He flies off

the handle sometimes; but me and

him are good friends.  Right, Moe?

MOE

Yeah sure.  Sometimes I gotta kick

asses to make this place run right.

Freddie and I had a little argument

and I had to straighten him out.

MICHAEL

You straightened my brother out?

MOE

Hell, he was banging cocktail

waitresses two at a time.  Players

couldn't get a drink.

MICHAEL

I have to go back to New York

tomorrow.  Think of your price.

MOE

You son of a bitch, you think you

can brush me off like that?  I made

my bones when you were going out

with cheerleaders.

FREDO

(frightened)

Tom, you're the Consigliere; you

can talk to the Don and advise him.

MICHAEL

The Don has semi-retired.  I'm

running the Family business now.

So anything you have to say, say it

to me.

MICHAEL

Freddie, you're my older brother.

I love you.  But don't ever take

sides with anybody against the

Family again.

MICHAEL

I have to see my father and his

people when we get back to the Mall.

KAY

Oh Michael.

MICHAEL

We'll go to the show tomorrow

night--we can change the tickets.

KAY

Don't you want dinner first?

MICHAEL

No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

KAY

Wake me up when you come to bed?

KAY

Your sister wants to ask you

something.

MICHAEL

Let HER ask.

KAY

She's afraid to.  Michael...

KAY

Why are you so cold to her and

Carlo?  They live with us on the

Mall now, but you never get close

to them.

MICHAEL

I'm busy.

KAY

Connie and Carlo want you to be

godfather to their little boy.

KAY

Will you?

MICHAEL

Let me think about it, O.K.?

TESSIO (O.S.)

Barzini's people chisel my territory

and we do nothing about it.  Pretty

soon there won't be one place in

Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Just be patient.

TESSIO

I'm not asking you for help, Mike.

Just take off the handcuffs.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Be patient.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)

We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at

least recruit our regimes to full

strength.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

No, I don't want to give Barzini an

excuse to start fighting.

TESSIO (O.S.)

Mike, you're wrong.

CLEMENZA (O.S.)

Don Corleone...Don Corleone.

CLEMENZA

You said there would come a day

when Tessio and me could form our

own Families.  Only with your

benediction, of course.  I ask

permission...

DON CORLEONE

My son is head of the Family now.

If you have his permission, you

have my good will.

MICHAEL

In six months you can break off

from the Corleone Family and go on

your own.  Carlo, I'm counting on

you to make the move to Nevada;

you'll be my right-hand man out

there.  Tom Hagen is no longer the

Consigliere.

MICHAEL

He's going to be our lawyer in

Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any

other business as of now, this

minute.  No reflection on Tom;

that's the way I want it.  Besides,

if I ever need any advice, who's a

better Consigliere than my father.

CLEMENZA

Then in a six month time we're on

our own; is that it?

MICHAEL

Maybe less...

TESSIO

Let us fill up our Regimes.

MICHAEL

No.  I want things very calm for

another six months.

TESSIO

Forgive me, Godfather, let our

years of friendship be my excuse.

How can you hope for success there

without your strength here to back

you up?  The two  go hand in hand.

And with you gone from here the

Barzini and the Tattaglias will be

too strong for us.

CLEMENZA

And I don't like Barzini.  I say

the Corleone Family has to move

from strength, not weakness.  We

should build our Regimes and take

back our lost territories in Staten

Island, at least.

DON CORLEONE

Do you have faith in my judgement?

CLEMENZA

Yes, Godfather...

DON CORLEONE

Then do what Michael says...

MICHAEL

All I can say is that things are

being resolved that are more

effective than a thousand buttonmen

on the streets.  Understood?

CARLO

Understood.  I just wish I was

doing more to help out.

MICHAEL

I'll come to you when I need you.

MICHAEL

All right, then it's resolved.

HAGEN

Mike, why are you cutting me out of

the action?

MICHAEL

Tom, we're going to be legitimate

all the way, and you're the legal

man.  What could be more important

than that.

HAGEN

I'm not talking about that.  I'm

talking about Rocco Lampone building

a secret regime.  Why does Neri

report directly to you, rather than

through me or a caporegime?

DON CORLEONE

I told you that it wouldn't escape

his eye.

MICHAEL

How did you find out?

HAGEN

Bookkeepers know everything.

Rocco's men are all a little too

good for the jobs they're supposed

to be doing.  They get a little

more money than the job's worth.

(pause)

Lampone's a good man; he's operating

perfectly.

MICHAEL

Not so perfectly if you noticed.

HAGEN

Mike, why am I out?

MICHAEL

You're not a wartime Consigliere.

Things may get tough with the move

we're trying.

HAGEN

OK, but then I agree with Tessio.

You're going about it all wrong;

you're making the move out of

weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and

if he tears you apart, the other

families won't come running to help

the Corleones...

DON CORLEONE

Tom, I never thought you were a bad

Consigliere, I thought Santino a

bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a

good heart but he wasn't the right

man to head the family when I had

my misfortune.  Michael has all my

confidence, as you do.  For reasons

which you can't know, you must have

no part in what will happen.

HAGEN

Maybe I can help.

MICHAEL

(coldly)

You're out, Tom.

MICHAEL

I'm going to talk to my father.

DON CORLEONE

I see you have your Luca Brasi.

MICHAEL

I'll need him.

DON CORLEONE

There are men in this world who

demand to be killed.  They argue in

gambling games; they jump out of

their cars in a rage if someone so

much as scratches their fender.

These people wander through the

streets calling out "Kill me, kill

me."  Luca Brasi was like that.

And since he wasn't scared of

death, and in fact, looked for

it...I made him my weapon.  Because

I was the only person in the world

that he truly hoped would not kill

him.  I think you have done the

same with this man.

DON CORLEONE

Barzini will move against you first.

MICHAEL

How?

DON CORLEONE

He will get in touch with you

through someone you absolutely

trust.  That person will arrange a

meeting, guarantee your safety...

DON CORLEONE

...and at that meeting you will be

assassinated.

DON CORLEONE

Your wife and children...you're

happy with them?

MICHAEL

Yes.

DON CORLEONE

Good.

MICHAEL

I've always respected you...

DON CORLEONE

And I...you.

KAY

How is your husband feeling?

MAMA

He's not the same since they shot

him.  He lets Michael do all the

work.  He just plays the fool with

his garden, his peppers, his

tomatoes, as if he was some peasant

still.  But men are like that...

MAMA

You come in, too.

MAMA

The Priest ain't gonna bite you

cause you're not Catholic.

(whispered)

He's in the back drinkin' his wine.

MAMA

You can.

GIRL

Do you remember me?

TESSIO

No...

GIRL

We danced together at Connie's

wedding.

TESSIO

Mike, could I have a minute?

TESSIO

Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

Says we can straighten any of our

problems out.

MICHAEL

He talked to you?

TESSIO

(nods)

I can arrange security.

MICHAEL

(softly)

Christ, Tom; I needed more time

with him.  I really needed him.

HAGEN

Did he give you his politicians?

MICHAEL

Not all...I needed another four

months and I would have had them

all.

(he looks at TOM)

I guess you've figured it all out?

HAGEN

How will they come at you?

MICHAEL

I know now.

(a passion wells up

inside of MICHAEL)

I'll make them call me Don.

HAGEN

Have you agreed on a meeting?

MICHAEL

(nods)

A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn

on Tessio's ground, where I'll be

safe.

MICHAEL

But after the Baptism.  I've

decided to stand as godfather to

Connie's baby.

PRIEST

(to MICHAEL)

Do you pledge to guide and protect

this child if he is left fatherless?

Do you promise to shield him

against the wickedness of the world?

MICHAEL

Yes, I promise.

NERI

OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or

you wanna move?

DRIVER

(obviously a hood)

You better check with your precinct.

NERI

Move it!

NERI

Let me see you license and

registration.

PRIEST

Ephetha...be opened...So you may

perceive the fragrance of God's

sweetness.

PRIEST

Do you renounce Satan.

MICHAEL

I do renounce him.

PRIEST

And all his works?

MICHAEL

I do renounce them.

PRIEST

Do you wish to be baptized?

MICHAEL

I do wish to be baptized.

PRIEST

I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.

CONNIE

Kiss your Godfather.

MICHAEL

Carlo...we've had a change in the

plans.  Mama, Connie, Kay and the

kids will have to take the trip out

to Vegas without us.

CONNIE

Oh Mike, it's our first vacation

together.

CARLO

(anxious to please)

Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...

MICHAEL

Go back to your house and wait for

me...

MICHAEL

(to KAY)

I'll just be a couple of days...

HAGEN

You'd better make your call to

Barzini; Michael's ready.

TESSIO

We're on our way to Brooklyn.

TESSIO

I hope Mike can get us a good deal

tonight.

HAGEN

(gravely)

I'm sure he will.

BUTTON MAN

The boss says he'll come in a

separate car.  He says for you two

to go on ahead.

TESSIO

(frowning)

Hell, he can't do that.  It screws

up all my arrangements.

HAGEN

(gently)

I can't go with you either, Tessio.

TESSIO

(after the pause)

Tell Mike it was business...I

always liked him.

HAGEN

He understands that.

TESSIO

(softly)

Tom, can you get me off the hook?

For old times' sake?

HAGEN

I can't.

CARLO

Godfather!

MICHAEL

You have to answer for Santino.

MICHAEL

You fingered Sonny for the Barzini

people.  That little farce you

played out with my sister.  Did

Barzini kid you that would fool a

Corleone?

CARLO

(dignity)

I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on

the head of my children, I'm

innocent.  Mike, don't do this to

me, please Mike, don't do this to me!

MICHAEL

(quietly)

Barzini is dead.  So is Philip

Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo

and Moe Greene...I want to square

all the family accounts tonight.

So don't tell me you're innocent;

admit what you did.

MICHAEL

(almost kindly)

Don't be frightened.  Do you think

I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you

think I'd make your children

fatherless?  After all, I'm

Godfather to your son.  No, your

punishment is that you're out of

the family business.  I'm putting

you on a plane to Vegas--and I want

you to stay there.  I'll send

Connie an allowance, that's all.

But don't keep saying you're

innocent; it insults my intelligence

and makes me angry.  Who approached

you, Tattaglia or Barzini?

CARLO

(sees his way out)

Barzini.

MICHAEL

(softly)

Good, good.  Leave now; there's a

car waiting to take you to the

airport.

MICHAEL

I'll call your wife and tell her

what flight you're on.

NERI

You know I would never question

anything you say.

MICHAEL

(smiles)

Speak your mind.

NERI

I'll do this for you; you know I

should.

MICHAEL

No.  This I have to do.

MICHAEL

Sit in the car.

MICHAEL

Where's the boss?

MAN

In the back.  Hey Frank, someone

wants you.

MAN

What is it?

CONNIE

Michael!

KAY

(comforting)

Connie...

CONNIE

You lousy bastard; you killed my

husband...

KAY

Connie...

CONNIE

You waited until our father died

and nobody could stop you and you

killed him, you killed him!  You

blamed him about Sonny, you always

did, everybody did.  But you never

thought about me, never gave a damn

about me.

(crying)

What am I going to do now, what am

I going to do.

KAY

Connie, how could you say such

things?

CONNIE

Why do you think he kept Carlo on

the Mall?  All the time he knew he

was going to kill my husband.  But

he didn't dare while my father was

alive.  And then he stood Godfather

to our child.  That coldhearted

bastard.

(to KAY)

And do you know how many men he had

killed with Carlo?  Just read the

papers.  That's your husband.

MICHAEL

Get her home and get a doctor.

MICHAEL

She's hysterical.

KAY

Michael, it's not true.  Please

tell me.

MICHAEL

Don't ask me.

KAY

Tell me!

MICHAEL

All right, this one time I'll let

you ask about my affairs, one last

time.

KAY

Is it true?

MICHAEL

(after a very long pause)

No.

KAY

(through her tears)

We both need a drink.

CLEMENZA

Don Corleone...

THE END
