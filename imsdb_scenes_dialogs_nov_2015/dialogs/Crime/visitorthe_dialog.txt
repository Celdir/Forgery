THE VISITOR

Written by

Tom McCarthy

WOMAN

Mr. Vale?

WALTER

Yes.

WOMAN

Hello. I'm Barbra Watson. Nice to

meet you.

WALTER

Yes. Come in.

BARBARA

Thank you.

WALTER

Can I take your coat?

BARBARA

No, thank you.

WALTER

OK. Would you like anything to

drink?

BARBARA

No.

(Beat)

Shall we get started?

WALTER

OK.

2

BARBARA

Let's try it again.

WALTER

The same thing?

BARBARA

Yes. Remember, fingers curved. Like

a tunnel.

WALTER

OK.

BARBARA

Don't flatten.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Make room for the train.

WALTER

What?

BARBARA

I said "make room for the train."

It's something that I tell my kids.

If you curve your fingers like

this...

(She demonstrates)

Then the train can pass through the

tunnel.

3

WALTER

Here.

BARBARA

Thank you. Next Tuesday at the same

time?

WALTER

No. I don't think I'm going to

continue with our lessons.

BARBARA

Oh, no. Are you giving up?

WALTER

No.

BARBARA

Oh. OK. Goodbye.

WALTER

Goodbye.

BARBARA

Mr. Vale? If I may ask, how many

teachers have you had before me?

WALTER

Four.

BARBARA

Well, for what it's worth, it's

difficult to learn an instrument at

your age. Especially if you don't

possess a natural gift for it. I'm

not saying this to be mean. But if

you do decide to give up then I

would really like to buy your

piano. It's a beautiful instrument.

BARBARA (CONT'D)

Goodbye.

WALTER

East Asia's experience is really

the exception to the rule, because

the conditions there that made

trade liberalization for the Middle

East successful weren't present in

the developing countries in sub-

Saharan Africa, and in Central and

South America.

WALTER

Come in.

STUDENT

Hi.

STUDENT (CONT'D)

Sorry it's late.

WALTER

Why is it late?

STUDENT

I had some personal things to deal

with.

5

WALTER

I'm sorry. I can't accept it now.

STUDENT

But...

WALTER

I'm sorry.

STUDENT

You know you still haven't given us

a syllabus.

WALTER

(Lying)

I know.

6

WALTER

Yes.

CHARLES

Hello Walter.

WALTER

Charles.

CHARLES

I'm sorry to interrupt.

WALTER

That's OK.

CHARLES

Walter, Shelley can't make it down

to the NYU conference to present

your paper. I'm going to need you

to cover for her.

WALTER

Why can't she go?

CHARLES

She's been put on bed rest until

she has the baby.

WALTER

When?

CHARLES

Next week. We'll cover your class

and make the arrangements.

WALTER

I wish I could, but now is not a

very good time, Charles.

CHARLES

I understand but you co-authored

the paper and the Dean wants it

presented. He wants to keep Shelley

on track for tenure.

WALTER

I just don't think I can with the

start of classes and my book.

7

CHARLES

You're only teaching one class,

Walter.

WALTER

So I can stay focused on my

writing. I'd really rather not go

right now.

CHARLES

I'm sorry but there really isn't

another option at this point.

WALTER

Charles, the truth is this is

really Shelley's paper. I just

agreed to co-author it because she

asked me to. I'm not really

prepared to present it.

CHARLES

That may be the case but you are

the co-author and she can't go.

Look Walter, you can take it up

with the Dean if you want, but, as

your friend, I wouldn't advise it.

Not with that argument.

CHARLES (CONT'D)

Good bye.

KAREN

Here you go, cutey.

WALTER

Thanks.

8

KAREN

So I thought you forgot about me.

Where've you been hiding?

WALTER

Just busy with work.

KAREN

Well you're never gonna make it on

the wall with that excuse. I'm glad

your back. Give a holler if you

need anything. I'm just gabbing

with one of my girlfriends.

WALTER

OK.

KAREN

When are you going?

WALTER

Today after class.

KAREN

Sounds like fun. I'm gonna go have

a cigarette. You want some coffee?

WALTER

Yeah. Thanks.

10

WALTER

Hello?

WALTER (CONT'D)

Hello?

YOUNG BLACK WOMAN

Stay away from me!

11

WALTER

It's OK. I'm not going...

AFRICAN WOMAN

Leave me alone! My boyfriend is

coming home!

WALTER

I'm not going to hurt you.

AFRICAN WOMAN

Who are you? What are you doing in

here!?

WALTER

This is my apartment.

AFRICAN WOMAN

What do you mean? This apartment

does not belong to you. How did you

get in?

WALTER

My name is Walter Vale. I have

keys. It's my...

MAN'S VOICE

What the fuck?!

YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN

Who are you?! Zainab?!

ZAINAB

I'm in here! He is crazy!

WALTER

Stop it! I am not...

YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN

Shut up!

WALTER

OK. OK.

12

ZAINAB (O.S.)

(In French)

Tarek. What is happening?

TAREK

(In French)

Are you OK?

ZAINAB

(In French)

I'm fine.

TAREK

(In French)

Who is this?

ZAINAB

(In French)

I have no idea! I was in the bath

and he was just standing there.

TAREK

(Shaking Walter)

Did you touch her?! Did you touch

her?!

WALTER

No! No!

ZAINAB

(In French)

He didn't touch me! But how did he

get in? He said he has keys.

TAREK

Do you have keys?

WALTER

Yes! Yes! I have keys. It's my

apartment.

ZAINAB

(in French)

What does he mean it's his

apartment?

TAREK

I don't know! Show me your keys!

13

WALTER

This is my apartment. I've owned it

for twenty-five years.

TAREK

So why haven't you been here!?

WALTER

I live in Connecticut. I haven't

used it in a long time.

TAREK

Are you friends with Ivan?

WALTER

Ivan? Who is Ivan?

ZAINAB

(In French)

I knew this would happen! He

probably called the police.

TAREK

(to Walter)

Did you call the police?

WALTER

No.

TAREK

You didn't call the police?

WALTER

No.

TAREK

And you don't know Ivan?

14

WALTER

I don't know Ivan. Who is he?

TAREK

He rented us this place. He said it

belonged to his friend who was out

of town.

WALTER

I don't know who he is but this is

my apartment. I assure you.

TAREK

Shit!

ZAINAB (O.S.)

(In French)

I told you not to trust anyone. You

never saw a contract.

TAREK

Enough! OK. Look. We don't want any

trouble. We will get out of your

apartment. This is all a mistake.

I'm sorry.

WALTER

OK.

TAREK

We will leave, OK?

WALTER

Yes. OK.

ZAINAB

(In French)

Where are we going to go?

TAREK

(In French)

I don't know but we have to go.

ZAINAB

(In French)

I know we have to go. I am not

stupid!

15

TAREK

Are you OK?

WALTER

Yes. I'm just going to sit down.

TAREK

Of course. Please.

TAREK (CONT'D)

I'm sorry if I hurt you. Are you

sure that you're OK?

WALTER

Yeah. I'm OK.

TAREK

OK. Well, we'll pack up and get

out.

TAREK

I know I'm in trouble when she

starts speaking Wolof.

WALTER

How long have you lived here?

TAREK

Two months. We will pay you if you

want.

16

TAREK (CONT'D)

(To Zainab)

Is that everything?

ZAINAB

I think so. Do you want to check!?

TAREK

Here is the coffee you wanted.

TAREK (CONT'D)

(To Walter)

OK. So we'll go. I am sorry again.

Thank you for your understanding.

Good bye.

WALTER

Good bye.

17

TAREK

(In Arabic)

Look I know. Come on man, it'll

just be for a night or two until we

figure something out. OK.

ZAINAB

Tarek?

TAREK

(In Arabic)

Can you check and call me back?

OK. Thanks.

ZAINAB

Tarek?

TAREK

What!?

WALTER

You left this at the apartment.

TAREK

Thanks.

WALTER

Do you know where you're going to

stay tonight?

TAREK

Yeah.

TAREK

You like classical music, huh?

18

WALTER

Yes.

TAREK

Me too. Do you play piano?

WALTER

No.

(Beat)

Do you?

TAREK

Me? No. I play the djembe. Well,

thanks again for letting us stay.

You saved me a lot of trouble.

TAREK (CONT'D)

See you in the morning.

WALTER

OK. Good night.

ZAINAB

Stop it, Tarek. He'll hear us.

TAREK

Trust me. He's asleep.

ZAINAB

You don't know that.

TAREK

So let him hear. The guy probably

needs some excitement.

19

ZAINAB

I think he's probably had enough

for one night.

ZAINAB (CONT'D)

Tarek. No!

ZAINAB (CONT'D)

What are we going to do, Tarek?

TAREK

I don't know. We'll figure it out

tomorrow. Who knows? Maybe he'll

let us stay. He's not really using

the place.

ZAINAB

I don't want to be his roommate!

TAREK

OK. OK. So we'll figure it out in

the morning. I promise, habibti.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Do you still love me?

ZAINAB

No.

TAREK

Really?

ZAINAB

No. I don't love you.

TAREK

Not even a little?

ZAINAB

No.

20

TAREK

So what is this?

ZAINAB

It's your punishment.

TAREK

But what about our roommate?

ZAINAB

Shhh.

WALTER

Good morning.

ZAINAB

Morning.

WALTER

I made some coffee.

ZAINAB

Thank you.

WALTER

Have a good day.

ZAINAB

Goodbye.

21

SPEAKER

That will be on the last day of

conference. I hope you can all

attend. And now I'd like to welcome

my distinguished colleague and

the winner of John Bates Clark

Award, Stephen Kriegman.

STEPHEN KRIEGMAN

Thank you, Shiva. Good morning.

It's a pleasure to be here.

COLLEAGUE #1

And so I just stood up and walked

out!

STEPHEN KRIEGMAN

Jamie!

JAMIE

Stephen, how are you?

22

MIDDLE-AGED MAN (O.S.)

Excuse me.

WALTER

Yes.

MIDDLE-AGED MAN

Are you Mr. Vale?

WALTER

Yes.

MIDDLE-AGED MAN

I thought so. How are you? It's me,

Jacob Konigsberg. Do you remember

me?

JACOB

I used to live here with my mother.

Your wife used to give me piano

lessons.

WALTER

Oh. Right.

JACOB

It has been a long time. I thought

that maybe you sold the place. Oh.

This is Sprinkles.

(To the dog)

Say "hi", Sprinkles. Is your wife

here with you?

WALTER

No. She passed away.

JACOB

What?! No! I had no idea. I'm so

sorry. She was such a nice lady.

And I just loved listening to her

play.

23

WALTER

How's your mother?

JACOB

She moved to Florida. Now I live

here. It's nice. There are a lot of

new faces. I hardly know anyone

anymore. But I have Sprinkles so...

WALTER

Nice to see you, Jacob.

JACOB

You too, Mr. Vale. Goodbye. Welcome

back.

WALTER

(Sotto)

It is important to distinguish

between both our current political

assessment and our...It is

important to distinguish between

our current political assessment...

24

GERMAN ECONOMIST

However, we do find that financial

globalization can be beneficial

under the right circumstances.

Empirically, good institutions and

quality of governance are crucial

in helping developing countries

derive the benefits of

globalization.

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

We should have them come play

inside.

COLLEAGUE #1

Coming in?

25

WALTER

Yes. In a minute.

(Holding up his cell

phone)

I have to make a call.

COLLEAGUE #1

See you inside.

TAREK

Hey Walter. Welcome home.

WALTER

Hi.

TAREK

You're home early.

WALTER

It was a half day.

TAREK

How was the conference?

WALTER

Fine.

TAREK

Sorry about the pants. I've been

playing like this since I was a

kid.

26

TAREK (CONT'D)

Hey. I think I might have a lead on

a place in Brooklyn.

WALTER

That's good.

You can keep practicing if you

like.

TAREK

Really? It won't bother you?

WALTER

No.   It's fine.

TAREK

Great. Thanks. I'll keep my pants

on.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Hey, Zainab's going to make dinner

if you want to eat with us later.

WALTER

OK. Thank you.

TAREK

I'm sorry. That was my mother. If I

don't call her every day she thinks

something happened to me.

27

TAREK (CONT'D)

Yeah. I'll have a bit. Thanks.

WALTER

Are you sure that you wouldn't like

some?

ZAINAB

I don't drink.

TAREK

(Jokingly)

She is a good Muslim. I'm a bad

one.

ZAINAB

Are you finished?

WALTER

Yes. Thank you. Here, let me...

ZAINAB

It's the least I can do.

WALTER

Well, thank you for the dinner. It

was very good.

ZAINAB

You're welcome.

TAREK

So what's the conference about?

WALTER

Economic Growth in Developing

Nations.

TAREK

That's us.

(Pointing)

Syria. Senegal.

28

TAREK (CONT'D)

So have you written some books?

WALTER

Three. I'm working on my fourth.

TAREK

Four books?! Great. My father was

a writer. A journalist.

WALTER

Is he still writing?

TAREK

No. He died. Before we left Syria.

WALTER

I'm sorry.

TAREK

So am I.

ZAINAB

Tarek. It's eight-thirty.

TAREK

Oh. We have to go.

(To Walter)

I have a gig tonight.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Walter, you can come if you want.

WALTER

I have to get some work done but

thank you.

TAREK

OK. Well maybe another time

WALTER

OK.

TAREK

Bye.

29

ZAINAB

(In French)

Why did you invite him?

TAREK

(In French)

We're staying in his apartment.

What could I do?

ZAINAB

(In French)

Well I would have been the one

stuck sitting with him while you

played your drum.

TAREK

You know you are very sexy when

you're mad at me.

WALTER (O.S.)

Hello.

WALTER (CONT'D)

If you don't mind, I think I will

come.

TAREK

Cool.

30

WALTER

He's very good.

ZAINAB

Yes.

WALTER

The whole band is very good.

ZAINAB

Yes.

TAREK

Sorry guys. Let's go.

WALTER

Tarek?

WALTER (CONT'D)

Tarek?

31

WALTER (CONT'D)

Oh. Hi.

TAREK

It sounded good Walter.

WALTER

Yeah. Well. I was just...I'm sorry

if I...

TAREK

Don't be sorry. That's what it's

there for.

TAREK (CONT'D)

I was lying on my bed listening to

my music and then I was like

"what's the crazy rhythm I'm

hearing?".

TAREK (CONT'D)

Sit. Come on. I'll show you.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Just put your feet flat on the

ground.

32

TAREK (CONT'D)

Now take the drum between your

legs. Like this.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Now you want to lift the inside

edge off the ground with your

ankles. Like this.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Great. Feel OK?

WALTER

Yes.

TAREK

OK. Now Walter, I know you're a

very smart man but with the drum

you have to remember not to think.

Thinking just screws it up. OK?

WALTER

OK.

TAREK

Now just give it a couple of bangs.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Not so hard. You're not angry at

it.

WALTER

Oh. Right.     Sorry.

TAREK

Better. Did you think?

WALTER

No.

33

TAREK

Good. Now one more thing, Walter.

You listen to classical music so

you think in fours. One. Two.

Three. Four. Da. Da. Da. Da. This

is an African drum. So we are gonna

play in three's. Tat. Tat. Tat. You

have to forget your classical.

Leave it behind. Tat. Tat. Tat.

One. Two. Three. Come on. Follow

me.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Good. Good ear. Now keep going.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Don't worry. Start again.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Yeah! There it is. OK. Good. Now

keep it going and I will do this.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Yeah. That's it. Keep it going.

34

WALTER

Hello.

ZAINAB

Hello. Where is Tarek?

WALTER

He went out. To look at another

apartment.

ZAINAB

Are you OK?

WALTER

Yeah. Tarek is teaching me the

drum. I'm practicing. Don't worry,

I'll keep my pants on.

ZAINAB

What?

WALTER

Nothing. I was just...nothing.

TAREK

Hey Walter, what time are you done

tomorrow?

35

WALTER

I have to present a paper at

eleven. I should be done by twelve-

thirty.

TAREK

Cool.

DARREN

(To the waiter)

Hey man, could we get another order

of this?

(To Walter and Tarek)

I love this food.

TAREK

That's good. Because the Chinese

are taking over the world.

DARREN

That's not gonna happen.

TAREK

It's already happening. One day our

kids will be going to China for

jobs. Ask Walter.

DARREN

You think that's true?

WALTER

Well...if China continues to

threaten the wage earners in the

first-world economies by keeping

wages down, then it's really just a

matter of time. What they buy they

inflate. What they sell they

deflate. But then you have to ask

the question `who's paying the

cost?'. And the answer is the

Chinese people.

TAREK

You see?

36

TAREK (O.S.)

Hey, Walter!

TAREK (CONT'D)

How did the presentation go?

WALTER

Fine. Thanks.

TAREK

Cool. Guess what? I found an

apartment in Brooklyn. We can move

in on Monday.

WALTER

That's good.

TAREK

Yeah. It's small but it's a nice

building. I just hope Zainab likes

it.

WALTER

I think she will as long as no else

lives there.

TAREK

I think you're right. Come on,

let's go. You should take off the

name tag.

WALTER

Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

37

WALTER (CONT'D)

Are you hungry?

TAREK

Yeah. I'm starving. Do you like

shwarmas?

WALTER

Uh...yeah. I like sharmas.

TAREK

Shwarmas.

WALTER

Yeah.

TAREK

Here. This is for you. For letting

us stay.

WALTER

Thank you.

TAREK

It's Fela Kuti. You know him?

WALTER

No.

TAREK

You don't know Fela? Oh, man!

Walter, you are in for a treat. He

started the whole Afro-Beat

movement. And his drummer Tony

Allen was just scary, man. You want

to play drums, you have to listen

to this.

WALTER

OK. I will.

38

OMAR

(In Arabic)

Hey Tarek. How's it going?

TAREK

(in Arabic)

Good, Omar. How are you?

OMAR

(In Arabic)

Not bad. It's fall in New York, you

know? How's the band?

TAREK

(In Arabic)

Good. Playing a lot. New

girlfriend?

OMAR

(In Arabic)

New friend.

TAREK

(In Arabic)

You have a lot friends

OMAR

(In Arabic)

I'm a very nice guy. Au revoir.

TAREK

Au revoir.

TAREK (CONT'D)

The Lebanese. Bunch of playboys.

You ready?

WALTER

Yeah.

39

ZAINAB

Yes. I made it.

UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN

How much?

ZAINAB

Thirty-five dollars.

UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN

Will you take thirty?

ZAINAB

No. thiry-five.

UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN

OK. I know my daughter will think

it's "cool". Here.

UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN (CONT'D)

Where are you from?

ZAINAB

Senegal.

UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN

Oh. I was in Cape Town two winters

ago. It was just beautiful.

ZAINAB

(Handing her the bag)

Thank you very much.

UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN

Thank you.

ZEV

How far is Senegal from Cape Town?

ZAINAB

Far.

ZEV

I told a guy I was from Israel

yesterday and he asked if I had

ever visited the Holy Land.

40

ZEV (CONT'D)

Hey, look who it is. What's up

Tarek?

TAREK

Zev!   How are you?

ZEV

Good man.

TAREK

Hey honey.

ZAINAB

Hello. Hi, Walter.

WALTER

Hi.

TAREK

How's business?

ZEV

Ahh. You know.

TAREK

Her stuff is great, right? She made

me this?

TAREK (CONT'D)

You should make one for Walter.

TAREK (CONT'D)

So Walter and I are going up to the

park to play for a little bit. OK?

ZAINAB

Tarek, I told you we have to pick

up my new table today. He said he

would only hold it for today.

41

TAREK

I know. I know. No problem.

ZAINAB

Tarek. You always say "no problem"

and then you are late or you

forget.

TAREK

I know. I will not be long. We'll

go up and play and then we'll come

back to help you. I promise,

habibti.

ZAINAB

Yes. It's always "habibti" when you

want your way. It closes at five

p.m. Not Arab time, Tarek.

TAREK

No. Not Arab time. Real time,

habibti.

ZAINAB

Don't "habibti" me.

WALTER

What does habibti mean?

TAREK

Habibti? It means "beloved one".

WALTER

Does she know that?

TAREK

He's been playing here for a long

time.

42

WALTER

Is he good?

TAREK

I have no idea but it's cool.

I always wanted to play down here.

It's supposed to be good money.

WALTER

So why haven't you?

TAREK

Maybe some day we can do it

together. Split the profits.

TAREK

What do you think?

WALTER

I think I'll just watch.

TAREK

Come on, Walter.

TAREK (CONT'D)

It's easy. You just wait until you

feel it. Let's go.

43

TAREK

Shit, we have to get home. Zainab

is gonna kill me. I'm on Arab time

again.

WALTER

What is Arab time?

TAREK

It means I'm late by an hour. All

Arabs are late by an hour. It's

genetic. We can't help it.

TAREK

That's our train!

TAREK (CONT'D)

I got your drum. My card is empty.

Can you swipe me?

TAREK (CONT'D)

(Laughing)

Hey. You paid for the drum and not

me. Here take this.

44

TAREK (CONT'D)

(Re: the train)

I think we missed it. Zainab is not

going to be happy if...

MAN

Excuse me, sir. Could you please

step over here.

TAREK

What are you doing?

MAN

NYPD. Could you please step over

here?

COP #2

Just step over here, pal.

TAREK

Please, what do you want...

COP #1

You jumped the turnstile.

TAREK

I did not jump it! I paid. I paid!

It just didn't work.

WALTER

Sir, I did pay his fare.

COP #2

Could you step back please?

WALTER

But I paid this man's...

COP #2

Sir, stand over there.

45

COP #1

(To Tarek)

Can I see some ID.

COP #1 (CONT'D)

You got anything else, Tarek.

TAREK

No.

COP #1

Where are you from?

TAREK

Syria. Why?

TAREK (CONT'D)

Why? I'm sorry. What did I do?

WALTER

I don't think that's necessary.

COP #2

Well we do. You can come down to

the station and make a statement.

WALTER

But he didn't mean...

COP #2

Sir, that's all I'm saying. Now

step back or we are gonna take you

in too.

WALTER

Where are you taking him?

COP #2

Ninth Precinct.

46

TAREK

Walter take the drum. Tell Zainab

what happened but don't let her

come for me. I will call you.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Don't let her come! I will call

her!

ZAINAB

Where is Tarek?

WALTER

He was arrested.

ZAINAB

What?!

WALTER

Yes. In the subway.

ZAINAB

Arrested?!

WALTER

Yes. It was just a

misunderstanding. They said he

would be released later tonight.

47

ZAINAB

How could this happen? He knows

better! He would not do anything

wrong.

WALTER

He didn't. I'm sure we it will be

OK.

ZAINAB

No. It won't be OK.

WALTER

Yes it will. I went down to the

precinct and made a statement.

ZAINAB

(Snapping at Walter)

That doesn't matter! He is

illegal! As am I! We are not

citizens. Do you know what that

means? Do you?! Of course you

don't. How could you?

WALTER

Yes. His name is Tarek Khalil.

Khalil. K. H. A. L. I. L. That's

right. Yes. I came down and made a

statement. They said he would be

released. That was six hours ago.

Well when should we know? Tomorrow?

Why? But he...OK. OK. Thank you.

ZAINAB

Well?

48

WALTER

They've moved him.

ZAINAB

To where?

WALTER

To a detention center in Queens. He

was turned over to immigration.

They said we can see him during

visiting hours tomorrow night from

five to ten.

ZAINAB

I can't visit him or I will end up

in that place too.

ZAINAB

Yes. We are going tomorrow. The

appointment is at eleven. I don't

know, he found him. What? No. I

don't want to. I just don't, Tarek.

Yes. I've already called him. I

know. I know. I just want you to be

here with me, Tarek.

49

MR. SHAH

Zainab, you're also undocumented,

right?

ZAINAB

Yes.

MR. SHAH

You know you can't visit Tarek at

the detention center, right?

ZAINAB

Yes. I know.

MR. SHAH

How long have you known Tarek?

ZAINAB

Almost a year.

MR. SHAH

Mr. Vale?

WALTER

A week.

MR. SHAH

A week?

MR. SHAH (CONT'D)

Does Tarek have any family living

here?

ZAINAB

His mother lives in Michigan.

MR. SHAH

She's also undocumented, correct?

50

MR. SHAH (CONT'D)

It's OK. This is all confidential.

ZAINAB

Yes, she is.

MR. SHAH

Does she know that Tarek is in

custody?

ZAINAB

No. Tarek told me not to tell her.

He doesn't want to worry her.

MR. SHAH

Has he ever been convicted of a

crime?

ZAINAB

No. He has had no trouble. He is a

good person.

MR. SHAH

Do you know if they ever applied

for asylum?

ZAINAB

Yes. When he first arrived from

Syria. But he didn't get it.

MR. SHAH

When was that?

ZAINAB

Seven years ago.

MR. SHAH

And did they appeal it?

ZAINAB

I don't know.

WALTER

Why wouldn't they appeal it?

51

MR. SHAH

Fear of being deported. It used to

be that when your asylum case was

denied, they let you go until your

appeal. A lot of people didn't

bother with it. Getting denied once

was enough to spook them.

WALTER

So what happens if that's the case?

MR. SHAH

Then there may be a final order of

deportation on him which means he

won't even go before a judge this

time. He'll just be deported.

ZAINAB

They had to leave Syria! They had

no choice!

MR. SHAH

Look, one step at a time. Let me

talk to him then we'll have a

better idea of his status and what

our options are.

WALTER

Is there anything I can do?

MR. SHAH

Visit him.

52

GUARD

That detainee has been moved.

SLAVIC MAN

To where?

GUARD

I don't know.

SLAVIC MAN

He was here yesterday.

GUARD

But now he's not. That's all I

know. You can call ICE. The number

is on the wall. Next. Sir, step

aside please.

53

WALTER

Hi. I'm here to see Tarek Khalil.

GUARD

You been here before?

WALTER

No.

GUARD

Can I see your license please?

TAREK

Walter. Thank you for coming.

54

WALTER

Of course.

TAREK

How is Zainab?

WALTER

She's upset. I have a letter from

her.

TAREK

You can't give it to me. It has to

be sent to me by mail. But you can

put it up to the glass.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Go ahead. Open it and place it up

to the glass so I can read it. It's

OK. It's allowed.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Thank you, Walter.

WALTER

How are they treating you?

TAREK

OK. The place is very depressing.

There is no privacy. The lights are

always on.

WALTER

Do you need anything?

TAREK

No. I just want to get out of here.

WALTER

Zainab and I met with a lawyer

today.

55

TAREK

Yes. What did he say?

WALTER

He is going to stop by to see you

tomorrow.

WALTER (CONT'D)

Tarek, Zainab said you were denied

asylum.

TAREK

You mean when we came here? Yeah.

WALTER

Did you go to your deportation

hearing?

TAREK

Yeah.

WALTER

You did?

TAREK

Yeah. We did everything they told

us to.

TAREK (CONT'D)

Hey, could you tell Darren? I

didn't call him.

TAREK (CONT'D)

(To Walter)

I have to go. They have to do a bed

count. Usually, I can visit for one

hour. Can you come tomorrow?

WALTER

Yes.

TAREK

Good. And tell Zainab I will call

her as soon as I can.

56

TAREK (CONT'D)

Goodbye, my friend.

WALTER

Goodbye.

ZAINAB

Did you ask him if he went to his

hearing?

WALTER

Yes. He said that he did.

ZAINAB

Walter, I'm going to leave now. I

have a cousin in the Bronx. I will

stay with him for now.

WALTER

You don't have to leave. You can

stay here.

ZAINAB

I think it's best if I leave. When

Tarek calls me then I will tell

him. You know how to reach me if

you need to. Is it OK if I leave

Tarek's things here for now? My

cousin's place is not very big.

WALTER

Yes.

57

58

WALTER

But I thought you said you went to

the hearing.

TAREK

We did. I remember it.

WALTER

So why is there a final order on

you? Did he say?

TAREK

No. He didn't know yet. He just

said that unless he can find a way

to reopen the case quickly they're

going to deport me.

WALTER

Maybe you should call your mother.

She might have...

TAREK

No. I don't want her to worry. I

can handle this.

WALTER

Did he say anything else?

TAREK

Yeah. Three years ago I was working

for some guy who said he was going

to sponsor me for my green card but

then he turned out to be jerk. But

the lawyer said that might allow us

to reopen the case. I don't even

understand it.

59

TAREK (CONT'D)

Walter, there are guys who have

been in here for years! I can't do

that Walter. I'll go crazy.

WALTER

He's trying to deal with the case

as quickly as possible.

WALTER (CONT'D)

Tarek. I have to go back to

Connecticut. I'll be reachable by

phone if you need me for anything.

TAREK

OK. Just please...don't forget

about me in here.

WALTER

I won't.

TAREK

Are you still practicing?

WALTER

Yes.

TAREK

You should go back to the drum

circle.

WALTER

(Quickly)

No.

TAREK

OK. But listen to that Fela CD.

That will help you, I promise.

WALTER

I will.

TAREK

So show me what you've been working

on.

60

WALTER

What?

TAREK

Show me. On that. Come on. I need

some music, man.

WALTER

Now?

TAREK

Don't worry. They can't arrest you.

At least not yet.

WALTER

OK.

TAREK

Ah. There it is. Good. Good. You

are getting better.

WALTER

Hello.

ARAB WOMAN

I'm sorry. I must have the wrong

apartment.

WALTER

Can I help you?

61

ARAB WOMAN

I'm looking for my son.

WALTER

Are you Tarek's mother?

ARAB WOMAN

Yes.

WALTER

Oh. This is Tarek's apartment.

I...share the apartment with him.

ARAB WOMAN

He did not mention that he lived

with someone.

WALTER

I'm not here very often. I live in

Connecticut.

ARAB WOMAN

Is Tarek here?

WALTER

No. He's...uh...he's not here. But

please come in.

WALTER (CONT'D)

Please.

ARAB WOMAN

Thank you.

WALTER

I'm Walter. Walter Vale.

ARAB WOMAN

I'm Mouna Khalil. I'm sorry to

show up unannounced but my son

calls me everyday. He has not

called me now for five days. I have

tried his cell phone but he does

not answer.

WALTER

Would you like to sit down?

62

MOUNA

Thank you.

WALTER

Would you like something to drink?

Coffee or water?

MOUNA

No. Is my son alright, Mr. Vale?

WALTER

Tarek was arrested. He's being held

in a detention center in Queens.

They are trying to deport him.

MOUNA

Where is Queens?

WALTER

It's not far from here. Twenty

minutes.

MOUNA

You have been there?

WALTER

Yes. I saw him yesterday. He's OK.

MOUNA

How did this happen?

WALTER

He was stopped in the subway

station. He didn't do anything

wrong.

MOUNA

I would like to go there. To

Queens.

WALTER

OK. But Mrs. Khalil. The lawyer

mentioned that...I don't think that

you can...

MOUNA

I know I can't visit Tarek, Mr.

Vale. I just want to see where they

are holding him.

63

WALTER

OK. I can take you if you'd like.

MOUNA

Thank you.

WALTER

Let me get my coat.

WALTER

Have you been to New York before,

Mrs. Khalil?

MOUNA

No. Tarek wanted to come to New

York to play music. I did not want

him to go but...do you have

children, Mr. Vale?

WALTER

I have a son. He lives in London.

MOUNA

And your wife?

WALTER

My wife passed away.

MOUNA

I'm sorry.

64

WALTER

That's it.

MOUNA

This is where the prison is?

WALTER

Yes. That's it.

MOUNA

It does not look like a prison.

WALTER

I think that's the point.

MOUNA

How many people are in there?

WALTER

Tarek said about three hundred.

WALTER (CONT'D)

There is a coffee shop on that

corner. It's not very nice but...

MOUNA

I'll wait there. Here.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Thank you.

65

TAREK

Walter, I thought you were leaving.

WALTER

I was.   Tarek, your mother is here.

TAREK

What? My mother?! Where?

WALTER

She is waiting outside.

TAREK

When did she arrive?

WALTER

Today.

TAREK

Oh man. Why did she come? She can

do nothing for me.

WALTER

She said she hadn't heard from you.

TAREK

Walter. Listen to me. She can not

stay here. She doesn't know anyone

in New York. I'm sorry but you must

get her to go back to Michigan.

WALTER

OK. OK. Here. I have a letter from

her.

WAITER

Do you need anything else?

66

MOUNA

No.

WAITER

(In Arabic)

Where are you from?

MOUNA

(In Arabic)

I am Palestinian from Damascus.

WAITER

(In Arabic)

Ah. I knew it. I am from Egypt.

Alexandria. I'm Nasim. Why are you

here?

MOUNA

(In Arabic)

I am visiting my son.

NASIM

(In Arabic)

He is in detention.

MOUNA

(In Arabic)

Yes.

NASIM

(In Arabic)

It's a bad place. I'm lucky. I have

a green card.

NASIM (CONT'D)

(In Arabic)

They're the ones taking care of

your son. They come here everyday.

They don't tip.

NASIM (CONT'D)

(In Arab)

Don't worry. They can't understand

us.

67

NASIM (CONT'D)

Hello, sir.

MOUNA

How is he?

WALTER

He's good but he's concerned about

you being here.

MOUNA

I will not leave.

WALTER

Mrs. Khalil, I'm not sure that your

being in New York will do any good.

We have a very good lawyer working

on Tarek's case...

MOUNA

(Politely but forceful)

Mr. Vale, I cannot go back to

Michigan knowing that my son is in

that building. Even if I can't see

him, I will stay.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Shall we go?

NASIM

(In Arabic)

The tea is on me.

MOUNA

(In Arabic)

Thank you.

NASIM

(In Arabic)

Is that your lawyer? Or your

husband?

MOUNA

(In Arabic)

Goodbye.

68

NASIM

(In Arabic)

See you next time.

JACOB

Oh. Hello, Mr. Vale.

WALTER

Hello, Jacob.

JACOB

Oh, hello again. Did you find your

son?

MOUNA

Yes. Thank you.

JACOB

(To Walter)

I let her in earlier.

(To Mouna)

I'm Jacob, by the way. I live on

the third floor. And this is

Sprinkles.

MOUNA

Nice to meet you, Jacob. I'm Mouna.

JACOB

So you two know each other?

MOUNA

Yes. Mr. Vale knows my son.

JACOB

Oh. Who is that?

MOUNA

Tarek.

69

JACOB

Oh. Tarek. He is very nice. And so

is his girlfriend. They are both so

polite.

MOUNA

Thank you.

JACOB

My mother and I are planning a trip

to go to Israel next summer. She's

always wanted to go.

MOUNA

I hope you enjoy it. Now if you'll

excuse me.

JACOB

Oh sure. We need to go on our walk

and do our business. Very nice to

meet you, Mouna.

MOUNA

You too, Jacob.

JACOB

Goodbye, Mr. Vale.

WALTER

Goodbye.

MOUNA

Thank you, Mr. Vale.

WALTER

Where are you going?

MOUNA

I will find a hotel.

70

WALTER

You can stay here. You can use

Tarek's room.

MOUNA

Thank you for your offer but I

cannot accept this. I don't want to

impose on you.

WALTER

You're not imposing. Please. I

would like you to stay.

MOUNA

Again, thank you. But I will

manage. Goodbye.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Goodbye.

WALTER

Mrs. Khalil?

WALTER (CONT'D)

Please. I was with Tarek when he

was arrested. He was in the subway

in the first place because of me.

Please. Stay. Even if it's just for

the night.

71

WALTER

The bathroom is just across the

hall.

MOUNA

Thank you, Mr. Vale.

WALTER

You can call me Walter.

MOUNA

And I am Mouna.

WALTER

Do you need anything else?

MOUNA

No. Thank you. Good night.

WALTER

Good night.

MOUNA

Good morning.

72

WALTER

Good morning.

MOUNA

Tarek said hello.

WALTER

How is he?

MOUNA

I can't really tell. He wants me to

leave. But I am not leaving.

WALTER

Well, you can stay here as long as

you need to.

MOUNA

Thank you. That is very generous of

you.

WALTER

Thank you for the newspaper.

MOUNA

Walter? Did Tarek and his

girlfriend, Zainab, live here

together?

WALTER

Uhm...Yes. They did.

MOUNA

And where is she now?

WALTER

She's staying with her cousin in

the Bronx.

MOUNA

I would like to meet her.

WALTER

We can go by her stall.

MOUNA

Her what?

WALTER

Her stall. She sells jewelry in a

stall.

73

MOUNA

Oh. OK.

MOUNA

Do you spend a lot of time in the

city?

WALTER

No. Not really. I just came down to

present a paper at a conference.

MOUNA

You wrote it?

WALTER

Yes. Well I coauthored it.

MOUNA

Congratulations.

MR. SHAH

And what happened after the

hearing?

MOUNA

We appealed. It took two years.

MR. SHAH

And your appeal was denied?

MOUNA

Yes.

74

MR. SHAH

Then they should have sent you a

bag-and-baggage letter which

basically tells you where to show

up and be deported.

MR. SHAH (CONT'D)

But you didn't receive it?

MOUNA

No.

MR. SHAH

You sure?

MOUNA

Yes. I would remember this.

MR. SHAH

Did you move?

MOUNA

Yes. Eventually we had to. But we

had our mail advanced.

MR. SHAH

Well, it wouldn't be the first time

that happened. And pre 9/11 it

wasn't much of a priority tracking

people down.

WALTER

So if they didn't get the letter

then does this help us?

MR. SHAH

It keeps our chances alive. If they

got it and just ignored it then we

couldn't push to reopen the case.

MOUNA

So you can help him?

MR. SHAH

It's still a long shot. Like I

said, the Government's approach has

changed radically.

(MORE)

75

MR. SHAH (CONT'D)

It's very black and white now.

Either you belong or you don't.

Which means a lot of people who

have been living here for years are

suddenly being swept up and thrown

into detention.

(He starts writing)

Tarek's lucky. Most of them don't

even have lawyers.

MOUNA

Lucky?

MR. SHAH

(Without looking up)

Relatively speaking. We just have

to move quickly to get an emergency

stay from the board of immigration.

Then, we'll stick with the motion

to reopen pending his green card

application.

MOUNA

Can you explain what that means?

MR. SHAH

Actually, I don't have the time

right now. I have to be in court

very shortly

MOUNA

How long will he be in detention?

MR. SHAH

(Without looking up)

I can't predict that. I'm sorry but

I am gonna have to wrap this up.

MOUNA

Do you have children, Mr. Shah?

MR. SHAH

Yeah. Two kids. And for what it's

worth my uncle was deported after

raising a family here for twenty-

three years. If I can get Tarek

out, I will.

76

MOUNA

Thank you. Where are you from?

MR. SHAH

Queens.

MOUNA

Which one is she?

WALTER

There. In the middle.

MOUNA

(surprised)

The black woman? That is Zainab?

WALTER

Yes.

MOUNA

She is very black.

ZAINAB

Walter?

WALTER

Hi Zainab. This is Mouna Khalil.

Tarek's mother.

ZAINAB

Oh.

MOUNA

Hello, Zainab.

77

ZAINAB

It is a pleasure to meet you, Mrs.

Khalil.

MOUNA

Please. Call me Mouna.

ZAINAB

OK. I'm sorry. I did not know you

were coming.

MOUNA

Neither did I.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Your jewelry is very beautiful.

ZAINAB

Thank you.

MOUNA

Do you have time for coffee or a

walk?

ZAINAB

Yes. I would like that. But I have

to watch my table.

ZAINAB

I'm living with my cousin. He has

two kids. And his mother. I mean

his wife...I'm sorry, I am very

nervous.

78

MOUNA

Why?

ZAINAB

I don't know. Have you spoken with

Tarek?

MOUNA

Yes. He called me this morning. He

is doing all right.

ZAINAB

I wish that I could see him. Just

for a minute.

MOUNA

Me too. How long have you been

here?

ZAINAB

Two years. I was in detention when

I first arrived. Three months. It

was horrible. I would probably

still be there but they closed the

facility for poor conditions. They

released some of the women on

parole because we were...low risk.

I met Tarek one year later.

(Beat)

I am sorry for what happened with

Tarek. I hope you do not blame me.

MOUNA

Blame you?     No. I do not blame you.

ZAINAB

Tarek was doing nothing wrong. I

miss him so much. I don't know what

I am going to do without him.

MOUNA

He said the same thing about you.

ZAINAB

He did?

MOUNA

Yes.

79

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Zainab, I would like you to do

something for me.

ZAINAB

What?

MOUNA

I would like you to show me

something that you and Tarek liked

to do. Some place that you like to

go.

ZAINAB

Like what?

MOUNA

Anything. Whatever you want.

ZAINAB

OK. But maybe we should get Walter

first.

MOUNA

So what is in Staten Island?

ZAINAB

I don't know. We never got off. We

just would go to the other side and

then come back.

WALTER

Why?

80

ZAINAB

It's free. And it felt like we were

going somewhere.

ZAINAB (CONT'D)

That is where the towers were. I

never saw them but Tarek did.

ZAINAB (CONT'D)

And over there is the Statue.    And

behind that is Ellis Island.

ZAINAB (CONT'D)

Sometimes Tarek would point at the

statue and jump up and down like we

were arriving to New York for the

first time. It was very funny.

MOUNA

Can you go up in the Statue?

WALTER

Yes. I think so.

MOUNA

You haven't been?

WALTER

No.

MOUNA

Oh.

WALTER

Excuse me.

(Into the phone)

Hello? Oh. Hi Charles.

WALTER (CONT'D)

What's that? Yes. I'm still in New

York actually. I stayed down here

to do some research. What's that?

Oh. I'm on a boat. Yes, a boat.

(MORE)

81

WALTER (CONT'D)

Listen Charles, I'll explain when I

see you but I have to go right now.

I'll call you back. Goodbye.

TAREK

You went on the ferry?

WALTER

Yes.

TAREK

My mother too?

WALTER

Yes. She liked it.

TAREK

Did Zainab tell you how we used

pretend we arriving in New York for

the first time?

WALTER

Yeah. She told us.

TAREK

You know they don't even let us

outside here. They just cut a hole

in the roof in one place.

WALTER

Really?

TAREK

Yeah. It's crazy stuff.

TAREK (CONT'D)

And they seemed to get along?

Zainab and my mother?

WALTER

Yes. I think your mother likes her

very much.

82

TAREK

My mother's not going home, is she?

WALTER

I don't think so.

TAREK

I know she's thinking about my

father. He spent seven years in

jail in Syria for something he

wrote in the newspaper. By the time

they released him he was very sick.

He died two months later. That's

when we came here.

WALTER

I'm sorry.

TAREK

She thinks the same thing is gonna

happen to me.

TAREK (CONT'D)

You know I have never seen them

together. Zainab and my mother.

WALTER

Are you hungry, Mouna? We can stop

for dinner.

MOUNA

I would prefer to cook if you don't

mind?

WALTER

OK.

MOUNA

Should we stop at a market?

WALTER

Yeah. That's probably a good idea.

83

WALTER

Would you like a glass of wine?

MOUNA

No thank you.

WALTER

Mouna? I need to go back to

Connecticut tomorrow. For work. I

told Tarek.

MOUNA

How long will you be gone?

WALTER

I don't know yet. I'll try to make

it back to visit Tarek as soon as I

can.

MOUNA

You don't have keep visiting him,

Walter. I'm sure you are busy.

WALTER

I'll see what I can do.

MOUNA

OK. Dinner will be ready soon.

MOUNA

Do you go to Broadway, Walter?

WALTER

Broadway? Uhm. No. I haven't been

in a long time.

84

MOUNA

Tarek sent me the CD for "Phantom

of the Opera" for my birthday. The

music is lovely. Have you seen it?

WALTER

No. I haven't.

MOUNA

I haven't either but I think I know

every word.

WALTER

Tarek is teaching me the drum.

MOUNA

Really? How is it going?

WALTER

Well, I sound a lot better when

he's playing with me.

MOUNA

How is your teaching going, Walter?

WALTER

My teaching?

MOUNA

Yes.

WALTER

Well...I have a lighter schedule so

I can work on my book.

MOUNA

Your book? What is it about?

WALTER

Well, it covers quite a bit, so

it's hard to explain.

MOUNA

Are you almost finished?

85

WALTER

I'm close.

MOUNA

You don't like to talk about your

work?

WALTER

No. It's just a bit complicated.

MOUNA

Why is that?

WALTER

It just is. It's just not a process

that's easy to talk about with

someone who's not a writer.

MOUNA

I didn't mean to pry.

WALTER

I shouldn't have spoken to you like

that.

MOUNA

It's OK.

86

WALTER

Thank you. You have my number if

you need anything.

MOUNA

I'll be fine. Thank you. Have a

safe trip.

WALTER

Well good bye.

MOUNA

Goodbye.

WALTER

Good afternoon.

87

88

MOUNA

Walter.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

I did not expect you so soon. I

was just cleaning a bit. I hope you

don't mind.

WALTER

No. Thank you.

MOUNA

I like this CD very much.   The

music is lovely.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Is it your wife?

WALTER

Yes.

MOUNA

She was beautiful.

WALTER

Thank you.

MOUNA

These are different glasses?

WALTER

Yes.

MOUNA

Are they new?

89

WALTER

Yes.

MOUNA

They're nice.

WALTER

Thank you.

MOUNA

I was going to make some lunch. Are

you hungry?

WALTER

Yes. Thank you.

WALTER (CONT'D)

Mouna?

MOUNA

Yes.

WALTER

I was wondering if...Thursday night

... Do you have plans?

MOUNA

No, Walter, I have no plans.

WALTER

Well, I thought that...we might do

something.

MOUNA

OK.

WALTER

OK.

90

TAREK

They keep moving people.

WALTER

To where?

TAREK

I don't know. I think to other

detention centers. Two Moroccan

guys were just moved. They had no

idea. Suddenly they were just gone.

WALTER

Has anyone said anything to you?

TAREK

No one in here knows anything. I'm

not a criminal. I have committed no

crime. What do they think? I'm a

terrorist? There are no terrorists

in here. The terrorists have money.

They have support. This is not

fair!

WALTER

I know.

TAREK

(Angrily)

How do you know?! You're out there!

WALTER

I'm sorry.

TAREK

It's just... I'm starting to wonder

if I'm ever going to get out of

here. I sit in here at night and I

keep thinking about Zainab.

TAREK (CONT'D)

I just want to play my music and

live my life. What's so wrong about

that?

91

WALTER

(Into the phone)

OK. OK. Please do. Thank you. Bye.

MOUNA

What did he say?

WALTER

He would make some calls but they

can move him to another facility at

their discretion.

ZAINAB

What facility? Where?

WALTER

He said it could be anywhere.

Upstate. Pennsylvania. There is

even one in Louisiana.

ZAINAB

Louisiana? Where they had the

floods?

WALTER

Yes.

MOUNA

That's so far.

WALTER

Yeah.

MOUNA

Did the lawyer say anything else?

WALTER

No. No he didn't know anything

else.

MOUNA

No one seems to know anything. It

feels like Syria.

92

MOUNA

Sorry to keep you waiting.

WALTER

That's alright. How is he?

MOUNA

He says hello. He wants to make

sure that you are practicing your

drum.

WALTER

I am. You look very nice.

MOUNA

You too. Should we go?

WALTER

Yes.

MOUNA

This city is just so huge! It never

ends.

93

WALTER

Ready?

MOUNA

For what?

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Really? The Phantom? Are we seeing

it?

WALTER

Yes.

MOUNA

Now?

WALTER

Yes. Is that OK?

MOUNA

That's wonderful. Thank you. I am

so excited.

MOUNA

I have to say that show was really

kind of scary.

94

WALTER

Yeah. It was kind of scary.

WAITER

Are you finished?

MOUNA

Yes.

WAITER

How is everything?

MOUNA

Very good. But I think I would like

a glass of wine.

WALTER

I'm sorry. I didn't even think to

ask.

MOUNA

It's OK. It's not every night that

you see The Phantom.

(To the Waiter)

I'll have a cabernet.

WALTER

Two please.

WAITER

Certainly.

WALTER

I haven't been to theatre in a long

time.

MOUNA

Me neither. There is a place in

Syria called Maaloula. It is a huge

outdoor theater. It's beautiful.

We used to take Tarek there to see

concerts.

WALTER

Cheers.

95

MOUNA

(In Arabic)

Cheers.

WALTER

Mouna, I've taken a leave of

absence for the rest of the

semester.

MOUNA

Really? Why?

WALTER

I just thought I might spend some

more time in New York.

MOUNA

Walter, you do not have to do this

for Tarek.

WALTER

I want to.

MOUNA

But you have to be in Connecticut.

You have your teaching. And your

book.

WALTER

It's fine really.

MOUNA

This is not your problem, Walter.

It's OK that you are busy.

WALTER

I'm not busy. Not at all.

(Beat)

Mouna, the truth is I haven't been

doing any work for a long time.

MOUNA

You just presented your paper at

the conference.

96

WALTER

I didn't even write it. I just read

it. I've been teaching the same

course for twenty years. It doesn't

mean anything to me. None of it

does. I pretend. I pretend that I'm

busy. That I'm writing. Working.

But I'm not doing anything.

WALTER (CONT'D)

I'm sorry.

MOUNA

Don't be. I appreciate you telling

me this.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Walter, what would you do if you

didn't teach?

WALTER

I don't know.

MOUNA

I think that is exciting. Not to

know.

WALTER

Mouna, what do you do?

MOUNA

Do you mean for work?

WALTER

Yes.

MOUNA

I work in a car dealership. I take

care of the accounting.

WALTER

Really?

MOUNA

Yes. It's very exciting.

97

MOUNA

What time is it?

WALTER.

Twelve thirty.

MOUNA

No?! Is it?

WALTER

Yes.

MOUNA

My God. Twelve-thirty! I have not

been up this late in a long time.

WALTER

I think that happens a lot in New

York.

MOUNA

Thank you, Walter. That was a very

nice evening. It's the most fun

I've had in a long time.

WALTER

I told Tarek I was going to take

you. He was very happy about it.

MOUNA

Good night, Walter.

WALTER

Good night.

98

WALTER

Damn it!

WALTER

There's a message from Tarek.

Something's wrong.

MOUNA

What did he say?

WALTER

Just that they were moving him. He

didn't know what it meant.

WALTER

Well when do you expect him back?

Can you have him call me the minute

he is? It's an emergency. Thank

you.

(He hangs up.)

He's still in court.

(To the CAB DRIVER)

Can you hurry please?

MOUNA

I hate this feeling.

99

WALTER

Hello. I'm here for bed 38. Tarek

Khalil.

MALE GUARD

He is no longer with us.

WALTER

What does that mean?

MALE GUARD

I'm not sure.

WALTER

You're not sure? Was he moved to

another facility? Another state?

What?

MALE GUARD

I don't know. I just know that this

detainee is no longer in the

facility.

WALTER

Well can you ask someone who does

know?!

MALE GUARD

Hold on.

MALE GUARD (CONT'D)

Sir?

WALTER

Yes. Did you find him?

GUARD

He's been removed.

WALTER

Removed? To where?

GUARD

Deported.

100

WALTER

What? When?

GUARD

He was deported this morning.

WALTER

He...how can that be? Is there any

way to contact him?

GUARD

I don't know. I don't think so.

WALTER

You don't think so? What kind of

answer is that?!

GUARD

I'm sorry, sir. That's all the

information that I have. Now please

step away from the window. You can

call the ICE if you have any

further questions. The number is on

the wall.

GUARD (CONT'D)

Sir. Please step away from my

window.

GUARD (CONT'D)

Sir. For the last time, step away

from my window.

WALTER

(Angrily shouting)

You can't just take people away

like that! Do you hear me?! He was

a good man. A good person! He had a

life here! You can't just take

away whoever you want!

(MORE)

101

WALTER (CONT'D)

It's not fair! We are not just

helpless children! Do you hear me?!

MOUNA (O.S.)

(Gently)

Walter.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Walter. Let's go. There is nothing

we can do. Let's go.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Come on, Walter.

MOUNA

He did nothing wrong.

102

MOUNA

Walter, I need to go back to Syria.

I should to be there for Tarek.

WALTER

When are you going to leave?

MOUNA

Tomorrow. I already bought a

ticket. It's best for me to be

there as soon as possible.

WALTER

You won't be able to come back

here.

MOUNA

I know.

WALTER

Mouna. I'm sorry.

MOUNA

Good night, Walter.

WALTER

Yes.

103

MOUNA

It's my fault. What happened to

Tarek. I did receive the letter

telling us to leave. I threw it

away. I never told him.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

We were here for three years by the

time the letter arrived. I had

found a job. Tarek was in school.

Everyone told me not to worry. That

the government did not care. And it

appeared to be true. And then,

after time, you forget. You think

that you really belong.

WALTER

It's not your fault.

WALTER (CONT'D)

It's not your fault.

MOUNA

Have you visited your son in

London?

WALTER

No. Not yet.

MOUNA

You should visit him.

104

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Here.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

Zainab and I picked it out

especially for you.

WALTER

Thank you. It's very nice.

MOUNA

Let me see.

WALTER

I like it.

MOUNA

So do I. You look cool.

WALTER

Cool?

MOUNA

Yes. You are very cool, Walter.

MOUNA (CONT'D)

I should go.

MOUNA

Thank you, Walter. For everything.

WALTER

I don't want you to go.

105

MOUNA

(She whispers)

I don't want to go, habibi.
