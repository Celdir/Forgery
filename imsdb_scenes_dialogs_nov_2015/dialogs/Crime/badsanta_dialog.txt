BAD SANTA

SANTA'S TEN COMMANDMENTS

TRAINER

(as she writes)

Coax... a... smile... from... the

child.

(turning to face them)

Remember, parents don't want photos

where their child isn't smiling.

Some children may not want to smile.

It is your job to coax a smile out

of them. A good line to remember is:

"Santa thinks everybody should be

happy. Can you smile for Santa?" A

camera can only copy a child's smile --

it will take you to put it there.

CUT TO:

TRAINER

If the child will not smile, the

Photo Elf will go ahead and take the

picture anyway. Now, it is a good

Santa's job to smile as well -- I

know with the big white beard your

smile will be partially hidden, so

you must learn to smile with your

eyes. They show warmth and can be

very expressive.

CUT TO:

TRAINER

Remember you have been chosen for

the starring role of Santa Claus.

Your portrayal of this beloved

character will have a major impact

on every child you meet. Keep in

mind at all times that to them, you

aren't a man dressed up like Santa,

you are Santa.

CUT BACK TO:

MOTHER

Hurry boys, we're gonna miss Santa!

She drags them across the street

toward the looming art-deco monolith

that is the big-city department store.

OLDER CHILD

There!

INTERCOM (V.O.)

Attention shoppers: the store will

be closing in five minutes. We hope

tomorrow is a pleasant Christmas and

thank you for shopping with us, your

friends.

PHOTO ELF

(dutifully reciting

his spiel)

My, what a darling picture! Are you

certain you only want the single?

Additional photos come in handy as

gifts for grandma and grandpa or a

wonderful remembrance for friends.

MOM

That's all right, I'll just take the

single.

SANTA

(disinterested)

Uh-huh... yeah... done.

BRATTY KID

I saw you in another mall.

SANTA

(not even looking at

him)

Right... Good for you.

BRATTY KID

You're not really Santa. If you were

Santa you could do magic.

SANTA

(looks at him)

You want magic?

SANTA

There, I just made you disappear.

SANTA

...That it?

SANTA

...Thank fuckin' Christ.

SECURITY GUARD

Merry Christmas, Willie.

SANTA

Up your ass.

SECURITY GUARD

Have it your way, Willie.

SANTA

Don't tell me which way to have it.

WILLIE

Ready.

MARCUS

Jesus.

MARCUS

How's it goin'?

WILLIE

I'm finished when I'm finished.

MARCUS

I'm goin' downstairs...

(referring to list)

I need a melon-bailer and a loofah.

WILLIE

Got it.

MARCUS

Fuck the loofah, let's go.

LOIS

Marcus, did you get the loofah?

MARCUS

Drive.

FADE OUT:

WILLIE

FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!

WILLIE

Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

CUT TO:

WILLIE

Goddamn it!

WILLIE

Yeah baby!

WILLIE

I got messages. Go wash yourself.

STRIPPER

I'm a dancer, I sweat.

WILLIE

Well you smell like a bum's nutsack.

STRIPPER

Fuck you.

WILLIE

Yeah, yeah.

VOICE (V.O.)

Mr. Soke, this is Andrew Kaplan again

from the collection agency -- BOOP!

ANOTHER VOICE (V.O.)

Willie, I don't care man, I'm not

looking to blame anyone, but that

diamond isn't a real stone, man. I

took it to -- BOOP!

WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Uh, hello, this is Helen Axelrod --

you ran into my car last week? Well

I called State Farm but they have no

record of any insurance policy for

you and -- BOOP!

MARCUS' VOICE (V.O.)

Willie, it's Marcus. It's that time

of year again. Pack your shit.

Phoenix.

CUT TO:

MARCUS

Jesus Christ! Can you maybe keep it

together for just ten minutes?!

MARCUS

For crying out loud, chew a few of

these... you drunken, fuckin'

imbecile!

CHIPESKA

Harrison, please I Just let me

explain. Financially, the --

HARRISON

You get what you pay for, Chipeska!

Five Christmases I've given my heart --

my soul -- my love to these kids,

and now what? Now you flip me for

some stranger who'll do it for peanuts

and happens to work with a real

midget! Lemme tell you something:

nobody cares! Nobody comes here for

the elf, Santa's the attraction! I

do Burl Ives songs; does this schmoe

even play guitar?

CHIPESKA

Harrison, it's not the money or the

midget. Believe me, if it was, I --

I don't think they like "midget". I

think you're supposed to call them --

HARRISON

Aw, forget it!

HARRISON

...Hacks!

CHIPESKA

Hi. Bob Chipeska. I, please, I, uh --

please don't listen to him. Great

resume and photo by the way.

MARCUS

Thanks... you know, we been at this

a long time an' all, so we like to

think we do a good job...

CHIPESKA

You two are the best men for the

job. Truly. So do not let his...

unpleasantness affect your performance

in any way.

MARCUS

Oh no, we're fine, w --

WILLIE

(irked, snapping out

of his daydream)

Performance?

CHIPESKA

Yea. Your performance... you know,

WILLIE

Performance. Like sexual?

CHIPESKA

Excuse me?

MARCUS

Willie no, he --

WILLIE

You saying there's something wrong

with my gear?

MARCUS

Willie...

CHIPESKA

I'm sorry. Your gear?

WILLIE

You know... fuck stick.

MARCUS

OKAY! We're gonna head upstairs now.

MARCUS

Such a card.

CHIPESKA

He's not gonna say "fuck stick" in

front of the children, is he?

MARCUS

No, no, no. Joke. Adult joke. For

us. Adults.

MARCUS

...Joke.

MARCUS

Merry Christmas! Santa's coming!

MARCUS

What the fuck you doing, "fuck stick"

in front of the boss?

WILLIE

I don't like that guy.

MARCUS

You don't like any guy. You think I

can't find another portly motherfuck

can run a water drill?

MARCUS

Don't tempt my hand. You blow this

and we're broke for the year. So

stop acting like you know something

because, pal of mine, you don't know

squat. You're gum on my shoe.

WILLIE

Yeah, yeah.

MARCUS

Now put on your fuckin' hat and get

out there.

MARCUS

MARCUS

WILLIE

(whispered to the kid)

...Let it go, you little bastard.

KID

It's not real.

WILLIE

It was real. The hair fell out when

I got sick.

KID

How'd you get sick?

WILLIE

I loved a woman who wasn't clean.

KID

Mrs. Santa?

WILLIE

No, her sister.

(whispers through

clenched teeth)

Let the fucking thing go.

KID

What's it like at the North Pole?

WILLIE

Like the suburbs.

KID

Which one?

WILLIE

Apache Junction. What the fuck do

you care?

WILLIE

Get the hell off my lap.

KID

You are really Santa, right?

WILLIE

No. No, I'm an accountant. I wear

this as a fucking fashion thing.

KID

Okay.

WILLIE

Get that kid out of here, he's

freaking me out.

WILLIE

I gotta get a drink on. See ya

tomorrow.

MARCUS

Just don't come in to work stinkin'

of booze again.

WILLIE

Don't worry about me. Get going,

you'll be late for your Wizard of Oz

Candy Bar Guild thing.

MARCUS

Lollipop Guild, asshole. Jesus, two

year olds flip me shit better'n you.

WILLIE

You tryin' to say something to me?

MARCUS

(pauses, then

deliberately)

Yeah. I'm gonna stick my whole fist

up your ass.

TROUBLEMAKER

(Hindi accent)

Listen here buddy, let me make

yourself perfectly clear. We don't

like your kind coming around here in

your red silk and satin clothes with

your hunger for same-sex

relationships. Consider yourself

warned.

WILLIE

Well fu-uck you!

TROUBLEMAKER

I know that's what you'd like to do!

WILLIE

Up yours, yufff --

VOICE (O.S.)

Don't.

TROUBLEMAKER

Oh saved by a woman, mister No-Pussy-

Please man!

SUE

He ain't worth it, sugar. He got hit

on last week. Didn't sit too well.

TROUBLEMAKER

WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT!?

TROUBLEMAKER

...This is not Flagstaff!

SUE

Another Grandad, Santa?

WILLIE

Yep.

SUE

Got a name?

WILLIE

Oh yeah.

SUE

What do you do? I mean, after the

holidays?

WILLIE

Nothing 'til March. Then I'm the

Easter Bunny.

SUE

...Another?

WILLIE

Why not. Buy you one?

SUE

Why not.

SUE

...Not a big talker.

WILLIE

Nah.

SUE

Buy you one?

WILLIE

Why not.

SUE

You're pretty regular, for a Santa.

WILLIE

It's my job, no big deal. I'm an

eating, drinking, shitting, fucking

Santa Claus.

SUE

Prove it.

WILLIE

Which?

WILLIE

Yes! Yes! Yes!

SUE

Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa!

WILLIE

At least lemme take off the hat!

SUE

NO!

SUE

I got a thing for Santa Claus, I

don't know, I guess it's from early

childhood.

WILLIE

(taking a swig)

Yeah, so's my thing for tits.

SUE

Maybe because my parents were Jewish

and never celebrated Christmas. Santa

was sort of forbidden, you know?

SUE

I like you. Most of the people around

here are pretty uptight. My name is

Sue. Here's my number.

SUE

...Don't mothball that suit!

TROUBLEMAKER

I AM NOT GAY!!

WILLIE

Whoa-Jesus! All right buddy, that's

it...

TROUBLEMAKER

Buddy? I said, I am not gay!

WILLIE

Look, what's the problem pal, you go

off your meds?

TROUBLEMAKER

...Yes, but this isn't about that!

You are queer as a ten dollar bill.

WILLIE

Now you listen. My brother lost an

arm fighting you people in Vietnam,

so I want you to take a good hard

look at this face...

WILLIE

...'cause it's the last fuckin' thing

you're gonna see before I knock your

head off and sh --

TROUBLEMAKER

Who is the bitch now, fat man?!

PIPING VOICE (O.S.)

Leave Santa alone!

TROUBLEMAKER

Please little boy, I am doing this

for all of us!

TROUBLEMAKER

I think he has finished his cruising

for tonight, hm?

WILLIE

You.

WILLIE

This one time I take you home.

KID

Uh-huh.

WILLIE

I'm not your fuckin' dada.

KID

Uh-huh.

WILLIE

It's not as if you helped out with

that nut-job.

KID

Uh-huh.

WILLIE

And you're right there to grab his

fuckin' balls.

KID

Uh-huh.

WILLIE

Right height.

KID

Yeah.

WILLIE

Twist 'em.

KID

Why do you need a car?

WILLIE

...Fuck you talkin' about?

KID

This car.

WILLIE

Whuh. Which turn is it?

KID

Sage Terrace. Where's your sleigh?

WILLIE

Repairs. In the shop.

KID

Where're the reindeer?

WILLIE

I stable 'em. Is it gonna be left or

right?

KID

(pointing left)

That way. Where's the stable?

WILLIE

Next to the shop.

KID

How do they sleep?

WILLIE

Who -- the reindeer? Standing up.

KID

But the noise, how do they sleep?

WILLIE

What noise?

KID

From the shop.

WILLIE

They, uh, they only work during the

day.

KID

I thought it was always night at the

North Pole.

WILLIE

Not now. Now it's always day.

KID

Then how do they sleep?

WILLIE

Well, they -- WILL YOU PUH-LEEEZ

SHUT THE FUCK UP! HOW THE FUCK DO

KNOW?! I'M GONNA -- Whoa! Sage

Terrace!

WILLIE

...What is it with you? Somebody

drop you on your fucking head?

KID

On my head?

WILLIE

What, are they gonna drop you on

somebody else's head?

KID

How can they drop me onto my own

head?

WILLIE

Not onto your own h -- ARE YOU FUCKING

WITH ME?

WILLIE

Nice digs. Daddy home?

KID

He's on a adventure 'sploring

mountains. He been gone a long time.

WILLIE

Exploring mountains? When's he coming

back?

KID

Next year.

WILLIE

What about Mommy?

KID

She lives in God's house with Jesus

and Mary and the Ghost and the long-

eared donkey and Joseph and the

talking walnut.

WILLIE

Who the fuck takes care of you then?

KID

Granma.

WILLIE

(hatching an idea)

Really... What's her name?

KID

Granma.

WILLIE

Uh-huh. Is Granny spry?

KID

Granma, Santa's here. Are you spry?

GRANDMA

Roger! You're home. Let me fix you

some sandwiches.

WILLIE

So you're tellin' me no one else is

WILLIE

...No aunts, no uncles, no cousins?

WILLIE

...Butler, security guard? Nothin'?

KID

Nuh-uh.

WILLIE

Daddy got a safe?

KID

You need money to fix your sleigh?

WILLIE

Huh? Yeah, whateverthefuck...

KID

You want milk and cookies?

WILLIE

Daddy got a car?

KID

Bye Santa!

GIN

"Fuck stick"?

CHIPESKA

Yes, I thought it was strange too,

but you know, I, I, I, I, uh, I, his

little friend promised he wouldn't

say it in front of the children.

Which is fine because, you know,

urn, there's an adult world and a

child's world and that's okay. I'm

not a censor.

GIN

Little friend?

CHIPESKA

Yes, a, a, a dwarf. Or midget... a,

a, I don't know what he's called

exactly but... a little guy. Little.

Billy Barty. God rest. But thin

fingers. Not the fat sausage fingers.

GIN

"Little people," that's what they

like.

CHIPESKA

Ah, yes, right.

GIN

So "fuck stick," that's all?

CHIPESKA

Well, no, there was something else...

CHIPESKA (V.O.)

...A couple of days ago I was in

Women's Big & Tall? --

CHIPESKA (V.O.)

and I heard these, urn, you know,

these... noises.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

WILLIE'S VOICE (O.S.)

Yeah! Yeah! You ain't gonna shit

right for a week!

CHIPESKA

Now don't get me wrong. I was against

the Clinton impeachment. What a man

does with his penis -- Oval Office,

Women's Big & Tall -- it's not for

the American people to say.

GIN

Right.

CHIPESKA

But when you're dealing with children,

a tender sensibility, a position of

trust -- then perhaps, someone who

has screaming orgasms with large

women --

GIN

Mm.

CHIPESKA

Though I can't fire him for that.

GIN

No.

CHIPESKA

Sizisra. They'd say.

GIN

Sure.

CHIPESKA

Not true. I am no siziat. But I can

see the picket line now.

GIN

Yeah, a big fuckin' fat one.

CHIPESKA

They'd all say, If it had been a

supermodel or, uh...

GIN

Heeyeah. Unfair practices. A lot of

special pleading. Bitch, bitch, bitch.

Fuckin' broads.

CHIPESKA

But -- I can't help it -- the guy

makes me uneasy.

GIN

Well sure. Santa fuckin' someone in

the ass.

CHIPESKA

So maybe there's something I could

fire him for.

GIN

Yeah. Yeah. I getcha.

CHIPESKA

Do you? Do you think you could find

something?

GIN

Oh shit yeah. There's always

something.

MARCUS

...Motherfucker... Oh, you lousy

fucking motherfuck...

MARCUS

That's just the kinda shit that's

gonna get us pinched!

WILLIE

(apologetic)

She said she was eighteen.

MARCUS

You promised no arcades! You said

you'd only hustle Big & Tall!

WILLIE

Ah, it's like shooting fish in a

barrel -- there's no sport,

MARCUS

How many times, you fuck? "The bigger

the store, the bigger the take."

Well, we can't work the big stores

with your big fucking train wrecks!

WILLIE

(pulling out his keys)

You got some nerve you little shit

ya! You my mom now?! You shat me out

your womb, is that it? You gotta

take care of me!? Well I can take

care of myself and I don't need no

lectures! I know how to keep a low

profile!

MARCUS

What the fuck is this?!

WILLIE

Mind your own fucking business.

MARCUS

You cocksucker!

MARCUS

...EVER HEAR OF THE OPEN-BOTTLE LAW?!

(then, to himself)

-- You dumb Dipshit Motherfucker!

WILLIE

Opal, come here.

OPAL

Screw you, Willie -- last time I

didn't shit right for a week.

WILLIE

No, not that -- come here!

WILLIE

Who the fuck's in my room, did you

see someone go into my fuckin' room?

OPAL

Yeah some guy askin' 'boutcha --

looked like a cop.

WILLIE

Ah fuck.

MARCUS

What guy?! You get a look at him?

INTERCUT:

WILLIE

No, I think it's a cop though. You

think someone's onto us?

MARCUS

Is there anything in the room?

Anything professional?

WILLIE

No. Clothes.

MARCUS

Just ditch. You got anywhere to sack

out for a while?

KID

Santa!

WILLIE

Yeah.

KID

You're bringing my present early?

WILLIE

NO.

KID

But I never told you what I wanted.

WILLIE

I said I didn't bring it, dipshit.

KID

Okay. Good. I want a stuffed elephant.

A pink one.

WILLIE

Yeah, well...

WILLIE

...wish in one hand and shit in the

other, see which fills up faster.

KID

Okay.

WILLIE

I'm gonna be staying here a while.

Things are all fucked up at the North

Pole. Mrs. Santa, she... she walked

in on me fuckin' her sister. So I'm

out on my fuckin' ass. She's taking

half of everything... This'll do.

WILLIE

...I'm gonna crash here. You and me,

like, you know, bachelors.

KID

Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?

WILLIE

No. Thank the fuck Christ.

KID

What about the elves?

WILLIE

Yeah, well, them. They stay with

Mrs. Santa. I get 'em on weekends.

Run me a bath, will ya?

KID

What about the reindeer?

WILLIE

(pleading)

Don't start with the fucking reindeer.

KID

...What're their names?

WILLIE

...Who?

KID

The elves.

WILLIE

(to himself)

Oh, fuck...

(then, to the Kid)

I -- I can't remember... Sneezy, and

Dopey --

KID

That's the Seven Dwarves.

WILLIE

Shit, is that not...? I just -- fuck,

I don't know, I'll just say, Hey,

Bub -- Look, I...

WILLIE

...FUCK ME! I DON'T KNOW THIS FUCKING

SHIT! WHY IS EVERYTHING A FUCKING

TEST WITH YOU?!

KID

-- How old are they?

KID

You want cookies?

WILLIE

No.

KID

Warm milk?

WILLIE

No.

KID

Should I fix you some sandwiches?

WILLIE

What is with the fixing sandwiches?

No.

KID

Okay. You want anything else?

WILLIE

No. As soon as the bed stops moving

I'm going to sleep...

KID

Okay.

WILLIE

...Wake me up... when the little

hand is on the...

KID

Okay.

SALESWOMAN

LOIS

Just looking.

SALESMAN

Help you with anything, ma'am?

LOIS

Just looking.

WILLIE

MARCUS

You can't just take up with some

WILLIE

You got some nerve you little shit

MARCUS

You said that last night you stupid

fuck!

WILLIE

Ah, shit! Fuck you!

MARCUS

You are by far the dumbest most

pathetic piece of maggot-eaten shit

that has ever slid from God's gilded

ass! What if the kid has one of those

fucking play-dates they have now?

WILLIE

You shittin' me?! He doesn't have

fucking friends! Not even an imaginary

one! Unless he got ditched by him!

He's just a fuckin' misfit! Lives

with his grandma who sits drooling

in front of the TV! Every once in a

while she gets up to play soccer

with her tits! What, she's gon' rat

MARCUS

You fuck her?

WILLIE

Jesus! Why is everything sex with

MARCUS

With me? I fuck one person, I ain't

out there serial fornicating, trying

to float my liver! Drinkin' myself

piece of shit I am!

WILLIE

What're you, fuckin' Sigmund Sawed-

Off Freud? The shrunken fuckin'

shrink?

MARCUS

Yeah, that's right, shit-for-brains,

talk about my height. Make it about

something safe. 'Cause you're an

emotional fucking cripple. Your soul

is dog shit. Every single fuckin'

thing about you is ugly.

WILLIE

Yeah? Well... fuck you.

MARCUS

I've seen anal warts more attractive

than you.

WOMAN

Oh, look who's here Jimmy! It's Santa!

(shouting, food flying

out of his mouth)

I'M ON MY FUCKING LUNCH BREAK HERE!

over the Toddler's

ears)

Are you insane?!! How dare you talk

NO.

GIN

Wouldn't want to.

CHIPESKA

Yeah. No. Of course not. I'm not

advocating celibacy.

GIN

Hope not. End of the human fuckin'

race.

CHIPESKA

Yes.

GIN

Fucks large women. What can I say.

VOICES

Loser! Dipshit!

VOICE

Wedgie!

CHILD

Pokemon.

WILLIE

Done.

MARCUS

Next!

KID

Santa here?

MARCUS

Oh jeez.

WILLIE

Is that your underwear?

KID

Part of it.

WILLIE

Where's the rest? Never mind. What

do you want?

KID

I was thinking I wanted a purple

stuffed elephant, not pink, but now

I changed my mind.

WILLIE

What.

KID

Now I don't want an elephant at all.

I want a gorilla named Davy for

beating up the skateboard kids who

pull on my underwear and he could

take his orders from the talking

walnut so it wouldn't be my bad thing.

WILLIE

...You know when I was your age, I

didn't need no fuckin' gorilla, and

I wasn't any bigger than you. One

day I came crying home to Dad because

four kids had beat me up, and you

know what he did?'

KID

He make it all better?

WILLIE

No. He kicked my ass. You know why?

KID

You went bathroom on Mommy's dishes?

WILLIE

What the fuck? No.

KID

He try to teach you not to cry and

be a man.

WILLIE

Nope, it was because he was a mean,

drunk son of a bitch. When he wasn't

busy busting my ass, he was puttin'

out cigarettes on my neck.

KID

Uh-huh...

WILLIE

The world's fuckin' unfair -- it

don't give ya nothing. You can wish

all you want but you gotta take what

you need. Stand up for yourself...

stop being such a pussy and kick

those kids in the balls or something.

(pause)

Or don't, I don't give a shit. Just

leave me the hell out of it.

KID

'Kay. Thanks, Santa.

WILLIE

Okay, go ahead...

WILLIE

...Get the fuck outta here...

KID

'Kay...

MARCUS

(happy again)

Time for the next lucky boy or girl

to --

MARCUS

What gives? Where's the grandson?

GIN

Open the rope there, Marcus.

MARCUS

I know you?

GIN

Not yet.

WILLIE

Santa don't do grab-ass, cowboy.

GIN

Act natural.

WILLIE

Huh? What?

WILLIE

...What the fuck?!

GIN

You are Willie Tugboat Soke and you

are Marcus "The Prince" Skidmore. On

Christmas Eve, you're gonna rob this

store blind. What say we go somewhere

private?

GIN

Research, that's how. I'm a department

store detective Sherlock, that's

what I do. Seven cities in seven

years. Pretty impressive. The stores

change, your names change. You always

get away clean. Yeah, pretty darn

impressive. But let's face facts --

you all are a couple of half-bucket

small-timers. Because of your physical

attributes you've found a niche. I

respect that. But you've also been

caught. By me. So this is the way

how we gonna do things. I don't want

to take over, I don't even want to

change your scam. Whatever you guys

do, it works. All I want is a taste.

When the deed is done, we part ways.

I buy a ranch in Havasu, you take

your little medicine show back on

the road.

MARCUS

(sighs)

How much?

GIN

Half.

WILLIE

Now you listen here, you --

MARCUS

Easy! Easy! Just back off, Willie. I

can handle this.

MARCUS

Okay. Thirty percent. There's three

of us. Thirty percent. That's fair.

GIN

Half.

MARCUS

I meant thirty-three.

GIN

Half.

MARCUS

And a third.

GIN

Half.

MARCUS

Thirty-five.

GIN

Half.

MARCUS

Forty.

GIN

Half.

MARCUS

Forty-two?

GIN

Half.

MARCUS

Forty-two five.

GIN

Half.

MARCUS

Fooooooorty... eight.

GIN

Half.

MARCUS

Forty-nine?

GIN

Half.

MARCUS

Well...

MARCUS

...what's one point.

GIN

Down the middle on the dough, and

any merchandise you take I look over

and cherry-pick.

MARCUS

No! Money's one thing, but --

GIN

It ain't Chinese menu, jagoff. I

tell yea how the way it's gonna be.

This is pricks ficks.

WILLIE

...Pricks ficks?

MARCUS

Ah, he's a fuckin' moron.

WILLIE

Yeah, well I guess that's how you

got the upper hand.

MARCUS

Fuck you.

WILLIE

Negotiating.

MARCUS

Fuck you -- you don't like it, next

year, fuck off. I can always get

another box jockey.

WILLIE

Yeah, and I can get another midget.

MARCUS

Yeah? Where? You see us hangin' off

of fuckin' trees? Like fuckin' crab

apples? And even if we did, you'd

never front your own racket. 'Cause

you got no discipline and zero fuckin'

initiative. You'd fall apart without

me. You're just too fuckin' pathetic --

WILLIE

Yeah, yeah.

MARCUS

-- too fuckin' pathetic for words,

you fuckin' loser. And you fuckin'

know it.

GRANDMA

Roger! You're home. Let me fix you

some sandwiches.

WILLIE

Ah, fuck it.

KID

...Santa?

WILLIE

Yeah.

KID

What're you doing?

WILLIE

Ah, nothin'.

KID

You goin' to work today?

WILLIE

Not really.

KID

You just gonna sit there?

WILLIE

Yeah. Lemme alone.

WILLIE

-- Kid.

KID

Yeah.

WILLIE

Later today, when the paramedics

come and bag up Santa...

WILLIE

...make sure the cops get this letter.

It tells about all the bad things

that -- that -- what the fuck happened

to your eye?

KID

Umm...

WILLIE

Well goddamnit...

KID

I didn't know he did that.

WILLIE

I think I've turned a corner.

MARCUS

(absent)

Yeah? You fucking Petites now?

WILLIE

No no. No; I beat the crap out of

some kids today -- but, you know,

for a purpose. It really made me

feel pretty good about myself --

like I did something constructive

for a change. Accomplished somethin'.

MARCUS

...You need many years of therapy.

Many, many, many, many, many... many

fucking years of therapy.

LOIS

Just looking...

WILLIE

...Hello?

WILLIE

...Granma?

WILLIE

Granma...

WILLIE

...Oh jeez.

SUE

Oh my God...

GRANDMA

Roger!

GRANDMA

...You're home. Let me fix you some

sandwiches.

WILLIE

(holding his chest)

No thanks.

SUE

(lifting her head up)

Hello little boy.

KID

Hello. Santa?

WILLIE

(frozen; teeth still

gripping panties)

...yes?

KID

I know that Christmas Eve is in a

couple days and you have to fly around

and give presents to the world and

after that you won't be around no

more.

WILLIE

...Yes?

KID

So I thought I'd give you your present

now.

WILLIE

(mumble)

What the fuck is it?

KID

A wooden pickle.

WILLIE

Why'd you paint it brown?

KID

Not paint. It's blood from when I

cut my hand when I was making it for

you.

WILLIE

...Thanks.

KID

You're welcome. Good night Santa.

Good night Mrs. Santa's sister.

SUE

That was very nice. He's really a

nice kid, isn't he?

WILLIE

Hold on a minute.

SUE

What?

WILLIE

Nothin'... it's just... I'm... well...

I'm sorta... fucking... touched.

WILLIE

...I don't know if I can fuck...

SUE

That's okay. That's okay.

WILLIE

BABY, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN FUCK!

SUE

There, there... There, there...

KID

SANTA!

KID

You wanna see my report card?

KID

Think I did good?

WILLIE

Who the fuck is Thurman? This is

you? Your name's Thurman?

KID

Yeah.

WILLIE

(incredulous)

Thurman Merman?!

KID

Yeah.

WILLIE

Jesus.

KID

(back to the report

card)

You think I did good?

WILLIE

Whaddya you care what I think, anyway?

(pause, relenting a

bit)

What do I fuckin' know? Better than

I ever did. I never got any B's,

KID

I thought maybe since at least I did

good in school, you'll bring me a

present this year. 'Cause last

Christmas and the one before that

you didn't bring no presents...

WILLIE

Oh...

KID

...Even though I'm a dipshit loser.

WILLIE

(a beat, then explodes)

Jesus Fucking Christ, Kid! Why do

talk about yourself like that? What

the fuck is that about?! What's with

you anyway? I ain't Fucking Santa

Claus! Look at me, I am living fucking

proof that there ain't no Santa Claus!

KID

I know there's no Santa. I just

thought maybe you'd wanna give me a

present 'cause we're friends.

WILLIE

Oh...

WILLIE

(pause, then sincerely

to the kid)

Look, kicking the shit out of those

kids, that's as generous as I can

get.

WILLIE

JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, I GOTTA GO TO

WORK!

MARCUS

No.

WILLIE

You fuckin' spic!

GIN

Sweet Jews for Jesus...

MARCUS

Holy motherfuck. What do you think

you're doing?

WILLIE

(sobbing)

I pissed my pants!

MARCUS

You son of a bitch!

GIN

Alright, let's get him out of here.

I'll go smooth this over with

Chipeska. Food poisoning, something.

MARCUS

What do you mean, get him out of

here?

GIN

Take him to his car.

MARCUS

In case you hadn't noticed, I'm a

motherfuckin' dwarf. So unless you

got a forklift handy, maybe you should

lend a hand.

GIN

That figures, you wantin' all kinds

of set-asides and special treatment

'cause of your handicap. You're all

the same.

MARCUS

Special treatment? I'm three fucking

feet tall, asshole -- it's a matter

of physics! Draw me a sketch how I

get him to the car!

GIN

Bitch, bitch.

MARCUS

Sketch it up, fuckin' moron. Fuckin'

Leonardo da Vinci.

GIN

What did you call me, thigh-high?

MARCUS

I called you a fuckin' guinea Homo.

From the fifteenth fuckin' century.

GIN

I could stick you up my ass, smallfry.

MARCUS

Yeah? You sure it ain't too sore

from last night?

GIN

You got some lip on you, midget.

MARCUS

Well it was on your wife's pussy

last night. Why don't you dust that

thing once in a while. Asshole.

MARCUS

There he is... that lousy,

leatherfaced, dago motherfucker...

GIN

Jesus, Mother Mary and Joseph! What

in the name of the holy lord Fuck is

the problem now?

MARCUS

Sorry, the van stalled. Give us a

jump will ya?

GIN

Well, I'll be dipped in dogshit!...

What am I, your auto mechanic now?

GIN

(motions to his battery)

Help yourself, small fry.

MARCUS

It's hard for me to reach...

GIN

Jesus Christ, give me those!

MARCUS

Thanks.

GIN

(then, to Lois)

Alright, TRY IT!

MARCUS

Oh my, what a terrible accident!

LOIS

Is he dead?

MARCUS

No, but it looks like you broke most

of his ribs.

MARCUS

(for Gin's benefit)

I'd say maybe... fifty percent of

them? Or do you think thirty percent?

LOIS

I needed more of a running start --

I couldn't build up any speed.

MARCUS

(shaking his head in

dismay)

Motherfuck!

MARCUS

Shit!

MARCUS

Put it in reverse.

CUT TO:

WILLIE

'Tendo it is.

WILLIE

...Everything I touch turns to shit

and dies.

MARCUS

What are you, drinking Sterno now?

'Cause you're sounding like my Aunt

Tilly right before she smeared her

own shit on the bedroom walls and we

had to lock her up and she spent the

rest of her life with a shaved head

and eating lunch through a tube up

her nose...

MARCUS

...You better be in shape by this

evening, fat man. After tonight, I

don't give a shit. But this is the

time to reach deep down and suck it

up.

MARCUS

...Lovely boy.

INTERCOM (V.O.)

Attention shoppers, the store will

be closing in five minutes. We wish

you all a Merry Christmas, Happy

Chanukah and a joyous Kwanza.

WILLIE

Barbie it is...

WILLIE

...That it?

MARCUS

Let's go.

MARCUS

...Oh Christ.

WILLIE

(red-faced, holding

breath)

Let's do it.

JESSE

Merry Christmas, Willie.

WILLIE

Up your ass.

MARCUS

All right...

WILLIE

Oh shit...

MARCUS

What? What-What-WHAT-WHAT?

WILLIE

It's a Kitnerboy Redoubt.

MARCUS

So?

WILLIE

...You know Andy Pitts?

MARCUS

Yeah, Andy Pizzarelli?

WILLIE

No, Andy Lapitski. Andy Pizzarelli

is Andy Blue Balls.

MARCUS

Huh-uh, since he got married they

call him An -- WHAT'S YOUR FUCKING

POINT?

WILLIE

Andy Lapitski can get into anything.

Anything. They say he's been in

Margaret Thatcher's pussy.

MARCUS

Yeah? YEAH?

WILLIE

In the joint he told me that the

Kitnerboy...

WILLIE

...cannot be cracked.

MARCUS

elf costume YOU CANNOT GET IN THAT

Piece of cake.

WILLIE

MARCUS

Store dick don't want shit.

WILLIE

...greedier than fuck.

MARCUS

Store dick dead. Store dick don't

MARCUS

...Fuck the fuckin' store dick.

WILLIE

Dead, huh...

WILLIE

...I didn't even know he was sick.

MARCUS

Willie. This has been a long time

comin'.

WILLIE

Uh-huh.

MARCUS

Every year you're worse. Every year,

less reliable. More booze. More

bullshit. More butt-fucking.

WILLIE

Sure. The three B'a.

MARCUS

You gotta be able to rely, Willie.

WILLIE

You're monsters.

MARCUS

Believe me, Willie: there's no joy

in this for me.

WILLIE

Oh, I don't mean layin' me out. I

understand that. But just look at

ya. All the shit... grabbin' all

this shit -- do you really need all

this junk? ...This is Christmas?

MARCUS

Oh please. Don't gimme that trite

"commercialism" crap. This is what

we do, Willie. We get the shit.

Christmas time, we get the shit.

Because we are men. And Lois. It is

Christmas, Willie, and we are men,

and Lois.

LOIS

...Wuddya waitin' for, honey? Plug

him.

MARCUS

Good-bye, Willie.

MEGAPHONE VOICE (O.S.)

Drop the gun, munchkin!

MARCUS

Huh? !

MEGAPHONE VOICE

And you, Santa! -- drop the elephant!

MARCUS

...Where did you come from?

CHIEF

Tipped off.

WILLIE

Shit!

WILLIE

...Fuckin' kid!

CHIEF

All three of you are in so much shit

it's almost unbelievable.

LOIS

Gevalt.

MARCUS

Oh yeah? Well come'n get us, coppers!

Ha-ha-ha-ha!

WILLIE

Fuck me...

WILLIE

...fuck me fuck me fuck me...

WILLIE

...It's Christmas... and the fucking

kid is getting his present.

MEGAPHONE VOICE

Halt, put your hands up!

WILLIE

Up your ass!

POLICE VOICE

All right, boys -- nail him!

COP

Somebody put a zipper on those fuckin'

kids!

FADE OUT:

WILLIE (V.O.)

Dear kid. I hope that you got my

present and that there wasn't too

much blood on it, although there was

blood on the present you gave me

which didn't keep me from enjoying

it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter

so much I guess.

WILLIE (V.O.)

...Anyway, just in case they took it

as evidence I am also sending you a

T-shirt. I hope it's the right size.

I am healing up good and they tell

me that I will soon be one hundred

percent even with eight bullets dug

out of me because they didn't hit

any vital organs, just my liver which

is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha. Anyways...

WILLIE (V.O.)

...Thank you for giving that letter

to the cops. I forgot I asked you to

do it but it's a good thing you did

or Santa's little helper would've

plugged his ass. And now the cops

know I wrote it, which is gonna keep

my ass out of jail. That, plus

everyone agreeing that the Phoenix

police department shooting an unarmed

Santa was even more fucked-up than

Rodney King. The cops are treating

me like fucking royalty now which is

new in my experience. They are gonna

make me a sensitivity counselor so

that tragedies like this will never

again embarrass the whole fucking

department. Whatever.

WILLIE

...As for my little helper, I am

sorry to have to tell you that him

and his prune-faced mail-order-wife

are gonna be exploring mountains

with your dad. I hope your dad doesn't

go sucking shit from them like I

did. Meanwhile, I told the cops you

had no one to take the fuck care of

you, so they set it up with Mrs.

Santa's sister watching you till

your Dad gets back in one year and

three months. They made her a Guardian

Pro-Temp or some such shit... anyway,

she makes better money than bartending

and seems to like you and your house

and Jacuzzi.

WILLIE (V.O.)

...So I'll be staying in Phoenix

now, telling the police how screwed-

up they are which is not a bad job

as jobs go. They're supposed to let

me out of this hospital room soon so

I'll see you when I come over to

fuck Mrs. Santa's sister in the

Jacuzzi. Until then, don't take no

shit from nobody. Least of all

yourself. Anyways... see ya soon...

WILLIE (V.O.)

...Santa.

FADE OUT:

THE END
