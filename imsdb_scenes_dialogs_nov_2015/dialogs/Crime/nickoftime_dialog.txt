MR. SMITH

Look sharp.

MS. JONES

That one.

MR. SMITH

Nah.  Hates his wife.

MS. JONES

I hate rollerblades.

GENE

Lynn!  Lynn!!

GENE

Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?

GENE

I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of

my sight, all right? I want you to

stay right by me. Will you do that

for me?

LYNN

Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the

platform and gives out an exaggerated

sigh.

GENE

We made it.

LYNN

We made it.

MS. JONES

Skate-boarders I don't mind, even

though they dress like fuckin' idiots,

but when I see some pin-head on

rollerblades, I get the definite

urge to grease the grill of my car

with 'em.

MR. SMITH

Keep your eyes peeled.

MS. JONES

What about them?

MR. SMITH

Too old.

MR. JONES

Him!

MR. SMITH

If you ever had an idea it would die

of malnutrition. First those blue

hairs then some Spic.  Leave this to

me. I know people. It's my job. I'm

a people person.

MS. JONES

What the fuck are you looking for?

MR. SMITH

I'm looking for them.

MS. JONES

Where?

MR. SMITH

Right there.

GENE

I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do

you see a phone?

GENE

Come on, you.

GENE

(to LYNN)

Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss

like that?

LYNN

On TV.

GENE

You never saw your Mom and me kiss

like that?

GENE

(to LYNN)

Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You

can talk about her all you want. You

know that, don't you?

GENE

So, come on. You never saw us kiss

like that?

LYNN

No way.

GENE

How did you see us kiss?

GENE

That's it? That little peck of a

kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some

kisses.

GENE

Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call.

MR. SMITH

Look at 'em. He'd do anything for

her.-

MS. JONES

Young love.

MR. SMITH

(sotto voce)

Foreigners! Fuck!

MS. JONES

Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and

when we need their help in Kuwait,

where the fuck are they?

GENE

Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have

an interview with him at twelve-

thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is

Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at

the last minute like this but...

Hey, hey!

GENE

Watch that! Lynn, come here!

GENE

Sorry. There's some crazy kids on

skates. Listen, the train just got

in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few

minutes late.

GENE

Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as

I can. Bye, now.

GENE

(to LYNN)

Ready?

LYNN

Nods.

GENE

Let' s do it.

GENE

Whoops.

GENE

Now, see, this is why you should

always wear a helmet and knee pads.

You never know when you're going to

fall down and go boom. Right?

LYNN

Right.

MR. SMITH

Perfect.

MS. JONES

(not so sure)

Perfect.

MR. SMITH

Could I see some identification,

sir?

GENE

What?

MS. JONES

(ditto with the badge)

I.D. Could we see some?

GENE

Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem?

Will a driver's license do?

MR. SMITH

That'll do just fine.

GENE

Is this about those kids? Look, I'm

sorry about that. But they darn

near...

MR. SMITH

You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?

GENE

Yes.

MS. JONES

Where's that?

GENE

Near Lompoc, north. What's...

MR. SMITH

Come with us, sir.

GENE

I'd like to know what...

MR."SMITH

Don't cause a ruckus, sir.

MR. SMITH

You don't want to cause a ruckus,

with the little girl and all.

MS. JONES

Come with me, honey.

GENE

Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take

the girl!

MR. SMITH

Don't worry. She's good with kids.

LYNN

You stole that.

MS. JONES

No, I didn't. I confiscated it.

There's a difference.

GENE

What is going on?

MR. SMITH

Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.

MS. JONES

Let's get your seatbelt on. Always

gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that

right?

LYNN

I want my daddy.

MS. JONES

There's your daddy. See? We're your

daddy's friends.

MR. SMITH

That's right. The policeman is your

friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?

MR. SMITH

Daddy?

GENE

Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our

friends.

MS. JONES

Hey, would you look at this crazy

car? Everybody has their own radio.

What do you think of that?

LYNN

Everybody does?

MS. JONES

Yep. And you can listen to it without

anybody else listening. Let's try it

out.

MS. JONES

This is what they call the jack. Hi,

Jack!

LYNN

Laughs.

MS. JONES

It goes in that little hole.

LYNN

Let me do it.

LYNN

(loudly)

It's loud!

MS JONES

Removes a Pro Label Machine from

under the seat. She begins to type

in several characters.

MR. SMITH

Let's get down to business.

GENE

Who are you? You're not the police.

MS. JONES

Brilliant.

MR. SMITH

Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay

attention and your daughter won't be

hurt.

GENE

You wouldn't...

MS. JONES

Try us.

GENE

Get your hands off her.

MR. SMITH

Mr. Watson, you're not paying

attention. Your daughter's life

depends on you. Do you understand

that?

GENE

Yes, yes, I understand.

MR. SMITH

Good.

MR. SMITH

This is for you. In it there is a

picture of a woman and an itinerary.

It is her itinerary. She is presently -

are you listening, Mr. Watson?

GENE

Yes, I'm listening.

MR. SMITH

She is presently at the Bonaventure

Hotel. That's right near here.

MR. SMITH

When you leave this van you will get

yourself a cab and take it to the

Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will

take this.

MR. SMITH

...and you will kill the woman whose

picture is in there. Not just shoot

her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend

you empty the gun into her. Close

up. Got all that?

GENE

You're out of your mind.

MR. SMITH

What's your point?

GENE

I will do no such thing.

MR. SMITH

Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.

MS. JONES

Don't worry. We'll take good care of

the kid.

MR. SMITH

It is now 12:16. If the woman in the

picture is alive at 1:30...

(holds up a walkie-

talkie)

...I call my partner, your daughter

is dead.

MR. SMITH

And what happens if I don't call

you?

MS. JONES

I kill her anyway.

MR. SMITH

Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do

you understand?

MR. SMITH

The woman in the picture...

MR. SMITH

...or your daughter.

GENE

Oh, my God...

MR. SMITH

God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only

you can help her.

MS. JONES

Only you.

MR. SMITH

You're wasting time.

LYNN

Where is my daddy going?

MS. JONES

He's going to help the police. Your

daddy is going to be a hero.

LYNN

My daddy is going to be a hero? Like

Power Rangers?

MS. JONES

Just like Power Rangers.

MR. SMITH

Let's test this thing. You on?

MS. JONES (O.S.)

(filtered)

Reading you.

MR. SMITH

You'11 need some cash.

(re: the wallet)

I'll hang onto this for the time

being. Oh, and...

MR. SMITH

You'll need these.

MR. SMITH

Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a

wastin'.

LITTLE GIRL

Mama!

MR. SMITH

You talk to a cop, you even look at

a cop too long and your daughter is

dead.

(into walkie-talkie)

Do it.

MS. JONES (O.S.)

(filtered)

Go ahead, sugar Die.

LYNN (V.O.)

(filtered)

Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling

Daddy. Come in, Daddy.

GENE

Lynn!

LYNN (V.O.)

(filtered)

I can hear you good. Can you hear

me?

GENE

Yes. Yes, I can hear you.

MR. SMITH

That's enough.

MS. JONES (V.O.)

(filtered)

'Daddy has to go now.

LYNN

(filtered)

He has to say "over and out". Daddy,

you have to say "over and out".

GENE

Over and out.

MR. SMITH

Look at your watch. Look at it! At

one-thirty your little girl is dead.

Say it with me. At one-thirty my

little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!

GENE

(softly)

At one thirty my little girl is dead.

MR. SMITH

Unless you do what you're told. Go

do it!

MR. SMITH

And don't forget I'll be watching

you.

CABBIE

Where to, sir?

GENE

The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure

Hotel. Do you know where that is?

CABBIE

Amtrack?

GENE

What?

CABBIE

You just come in on Amtrack?

GENE

Uh, yes..

CABBIE

Business or pleasure?

GENE

Business.

CABBIE

Where'd you come from?

GENE

San Diego.

CABBIE

Oh, San Diego? I've thought about

moving to San Diego.  It's hard to

make a living in this town. These

short hops.  Can't make a dime on

'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can

make a buck. These little hops cost

me money.

GENE

Sorry.

CABBIE

'S okay. What do you think?

GENE

Huh?

CABBIE

Better in San Diego? More opportunity

there? What?

GENE

I really don't know. I don't live

there. I was just visiting...a grave.

CABBIE

Aw, too bad.

CABBIE

Somebody close?

GENE

What?

CABBIE

The grave. Somebody close?

GENE

Wife. Ex-wife. Almost ex. We were

separated. She was thinking about a

divorce.

GENE

Look...I've... I've got a problem. A

big problem...

CABBIE

Oh, yeah?

CABBIE

Jesus! Watch it, buddy!

CABBIE

I'd love to hear about your problem,

but the ride's over. Three-fifty.

CABBIE

Three-fifty. I hope your problem

doesn't have anything to do with my

three-fifty.

GENE

Right. Right.

CABBIE

What do I want with an accountant?

DOORMAN

I got one for the airport. You free?

CABBIE

You bet.

GENE

Oh, my God. Oh, no.

"RE-ELECT ELEANOR SAMARA GRANT GOVERNOR"

"HERE TODAY!"

GENE

Oh, shit.

GENE

Oh, sweet Jesus...

GENE

Could you tell me where the Emerald

Bay Room is?

GUSTINO

Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow

the signs.

GENE

Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

GUSTINO

No problem.

BRENDAN GRANT

(laughs)

Whoops!

BRENDAN GRANT

Nice body check.

BRENDAN GRANT

You know my wife has a deeply personal

reason for going after repeat drunk

drivers. They are felons and they

should be treated as such. A drivers

license is a privilege, not a right.

GENE

Excuse me, is the...thing over?

WOMAN

Yes. You didn't miss much. The

food...chicken again.

GENE

Eleanor Grant is gone?

WOMAN

Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same

at all these...

MR. SMITH

Check your itinerary. Move along.

GENE

This says "invitation only".

MR. SMITH

Of course you're invited. You're a

big donor to the campaign. They love

you.

MR. SMITH

This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red

Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.

GENE

Where did you get these? Who are

you?

MR. SMITH

I'm the guy who's going to kill your

daughter if you don't get moving.

ELEANOR GRANT

They-didn't hear a word I said. The

mike was too low on the podium.

KRISTA

How much did we pay for that room?

CHIEF AIDE

We didn't.

ELEANOR GRANT

Somebody did.

KRIST

A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems.

BODYGUARD

Excuse me, sir, this car is for the

Governor. You can take the next one.

ELEANOR GRANT

Don't you dare, Franco. This is one

of our biggest supporters.

ELEANOR GRANT

Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial

incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't-

it? I love saying that.

ELEANOR GRANT

Whose idea was it to have a lunch

right after the brunch? I'm about to

bust as it is.

KRISTA

We'll just walk through, do a little

grip-and-grin, then get ready for

the press con.

GENE

Governor...

GENE

I need your help.

ELEANOR GRANT

What can I do for you Mr....Watson?

GENE

Its'...ah...about my daughter....

MR. SMITH (O.S.)

Room for one more?

ELEANOR GRANT

I think we can accommodate you.

ELEANOR GRANT

Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial

incumbent.

MR. SMITH

A pleasure to meet you, Governor.

ELEANOR GRANT

You were saying?  Your daughter....?

GENE

I...

ELEANOR GRANT

Yes?

GENE

She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure

to get your autograph.

ELEANOR GRANT

Of course.  I wish everything were

that easy.

KRISTA

I've got the pen if you've got the

paper.

KRISTA

How about that?

KRISTA

Is that something precious?

GENE

No, that's,..that's fine

ELEANOR GRANT

What's her name?

GENE

Her name? Her name is Lynn.

KRISTA

It's funny. I don't even keep a pad

of paper with me anymore, everything's

gone so electronic.

KRISTA

If it wasn't for double A batteries

I'd be in big trouble.

ELEANOR GRANT

Are you all right? Elevators make me

queasy, too.

MR. SMITH

She was right in front of you! What's

wrong with you!?

MR. SMITH

Are you 'fucking with me!?

GENE

The gun...

MR. SMITH

What about the gun?

GENE

It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the

bullets in it.

MR. SMITH

You...

MR. SMITH

You won't get many chances like that,

Mr. Watson. That's the way life works.

Don't blow the next one.

MS. JONES

That's pretty good.

LYNN

I've done much better ones than this.

MS. JONES

You have, huh?

LYNN

Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much

more colors at home.

MS. JONES

That's good.

(checks her watch)

That's good, sweetie pie.

MR. SMITH

There, all loaded. Ready for the

hunt.

HUEY

Having a rough day? Down at the heels

as they...?

HUEY

(calling after him)

You don't see your face, you don't

pay!

HUEY

Having a rough day? Down at the heels

as they say? What you need is a shoe

shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.

HUEY

Take ten, take a break, take a seat,

take a load off. Put the world in

perspective.

HUEY

So, are you a visitor or lucky enough

to live in The City of Angels?

GENE

I'm...I'm visiting.

HUEY

What do you do, if I may be so bold?

GENE

(looking at MR. SMITH)

I'm just an accountant.

HUEY

Don't denigrate yourself, my friend.

Where would the government be without

accountants?  They wouldn't know how

hard they can squeeze us before we

pop, isn't that right?

HUEY

Now you take tips. Time was a tip

was between a man and his customer.

Not any more. They've figured out

what they call a formulae, don't

laugh, it ain't for babies. They

take your sales, see, and slap a

percentile on there, figuring that

somewhere between your lies and your

bad luck they'll hit on the mean

amount, mean meaning "in the middle",

but if you ask me it means "just

plain mean". Why you can have Uncle

Scrooge wring a nickel over your

poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy

Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins

like manna from heaven, don't make

no difference, they'll tax your behind

according to that same figure. Doesn't

seem quite right., does it?

GENE

No. No, it doesn't.

GUSTINO

Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'?

HUEY

It's a load, my friend, but somebody's

got to carry it.

GENE

I have to do something.

HUEY

What's that? You have to speak up.

(taps his ear)

I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between

that and my wooden leg I'm a mess.

Compliments of the United States

Army Artillery Corps.

GENE

I said I have to do something.

HUEY

I'll have you out of here in two

shakes o'f a lamb's tail.

GENE

Is within himself.

GENE

Drove me crazy. There must have been

one on me. I didn't add up so she

left. That's what attracted me to

her In the first place. She made up

her mind and she did it. She wouldn't

sit around waiting for...whatever.

She'd do something. She'd do

something.

HUEY

Yes, well, you know, for a quality

shoe you can't beat a good wingtip.

Wears like iron. You're a wise man.

There ya' go. Two bucks.

HUEY

You got anything smaller?

GENE

Keep it.

HUEY

It's a twenty.

GENE

Keep it.

HUEY

Well...thanks muchly...

GENE

Can I get out to Flower Street from

here?

HUEY

Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you

right out there.

GENE

Thanks.

MR. SMITH

You get another chance in ten minutes.

GENE

Then I have time for a drink.

MR. SMITH

All right, Mr. Watson, but make it

just one. I don't want you...

REPORTER

So where was I?

BARTENDER

I don't know. Something about the

Governor's new regime.

REPORTER

Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old

Boys like yesterday's newspapers.

REPORTER

The white boys are in for it. When

they got her elected they never

thought she was gonna make the

Governor's office look like the United

Nations.

REPORTER

We're talking Custer's Last Stand

here. The only minorities not on her

staff are the ones still lost in the

Rain Forest.

GENE

(a gasp)

Lynn!

MS. JONES (O.S.)

Shhh. You'll wake the baby up.

MS. JONES

(softly)

What we have here is what they call

a Mexican standoff. The thing you

gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind

the seat?"  Now, a twenty-two'd go

right through it, but even a button

will throw a twenty-two off so there's

a good chance it'd get screwed up

somewhere along the way, miss the

target. Maybe a thirty-eight?  A

thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight,

unless it hits metal, then it'll

bust up in little bitty pieces.

They'll keep going but they'll be

slowed down quite a bit. How's about

a three-fifty-seven?  It'll go through

the seat, her, you, the dashboard,

shit, it'll go through the engine

block before it knows it's hit

anything, end up in some pedestrian

three blocks away. What do you think?

What's my poison?

MS. JONES

Well it's a comfort to know you've

got the co-Jones to pull that thing

out. Whether you've got the balls to

pull the trigger we've still got to

see.

MS. JONES

(into the walkie-talkie)

He's coming back in.

MR. SMITH

(filtered)

I've got him in the crosshairs.

GENE

Pool Deck?

HECTOR

Fourth Floor. Take that escalator.

BRENDAN GRANT

My wife is not interested in negative

campaigning. She wants to accentuate

the positive. I don't know about you

but I find that refreshing.

A REPORTER

Have you ever thought of running for

office yourself?

BRENDAN GRANT

(smiles, charmingly)

Me?

BRENDAN GRANT

I'm just a business man.

MR. SMITH (O.S.)

I know what you're thinking.

GENE

What would you do in my place?

MR. SMITH

Me?

MR. SMITH

The bitch would be dead. Course I

ain't sayin' which bitch.

GENE

There's a plot to kill the Governor.

If you don't believe me, check that

guy right there. He has a gun.

OFFICER TRUST

So do you, Mr. Watson.

OFFICER TRUST

You got this under control?

MR. SMITH

Yeah.

OFFICER TRUST

It doesn't look like it.

MR. SMITH

It's under control.

OFFICER TRUST

It better be.

MR. SMITH

I oughta throw you after that walkie-

talkie but I'm going to give you a

break because you're an amateur.

WAITER M (O.S.)

Gentlemen...

MR. SMITH

Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.

MR. SMITH

Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.

MR. SMITH

There was this guy. Big guy. Irish-

Italian. Red-faced, black-haired,

jolly son-of-a-bitch.

MR. SMITH

Nobody could make me laugh like him.

We closed more bars together than I

can count. He was my pal. I loved

that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to

say it. But he was fuck-up. He had

this image of himself. Thought he

was con man. Always trying to shave

the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always

miss him. Tell me why.

GENE

What...?

MR. SMITH

Tell me why I miss him.

GENE

He's dead?

MR. SMITH

That's right. He's dead. Tell me

why.

GENE

How should I...?

MR. SMITH

Tell me why he's dead.

GENE

You killed him.

MR. SMITH

That's right, I killed him. He fucked

up one too many times so I put a

bullet in his eye. Then I put two

more into him just to make sure. Now

that was somebody I loved.

MR. SMITH

I loved that motherfucker but I got

the call and I put him down like a

sick animal. So if you've got any

doubts about what's going to happen

if you don't deliver let me tell you

something. I'd make gravy out of

your little girl just to season that

black Irish cocksucker's meat.

MR. SMITH

Do what you're supposed to do. Do it

now.

MR. SMITH

Shit!

TOM BRADLEY

It is my extreme pleasure this

afternoon to introduce to you...

TOM BRADLEY

...a woman who can only be

characterized as a one-of-a-kind.

KRISTA (O.S.)

Feeling better?

TOM BRADLEY

An iconoclast with class...

KRISTA

The elevator. You weren't feeling

well.

TOM BRADLEY

A genuine lady who's not afraid to

get into the trenches...

KRISTA

Are you better now?

TOM BRADLEY

...and go to the mat with greedy

special interests...

TOM BRADLEY

The finest Governor our state has

ever had...

TOM BRADLEY

My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor

Grant!

GENE

My wife always said I had a problem

trusting people.

KRISTA

Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara

Grant.

GENE

You don't understand. I'm going to

trust you. And you have to trust me.

KRISTA

Yes, you're right, I don't understand.

GENE

Look...my daughter ... she's going

to die...unless you can help me.

KRISTA

Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me

get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist

you, he's our...

GENE

(sotto voce)

No! You have to listen to me.

KRISTA

I'm listening, I'm listening.

ELEANOR GRANT

My friends, my good friends...

GENE

Please...please...you have to believe

me... They have my daughter.  They

want me to kill Eleanor Grant  or

they'll kill my daughter.

KRISTA

All right, let's just...let's get

security in on this.

GENE

No! You can't! They're in on it.

KRISTA

I don't see how they could be in on

it. They're the best. They're hand-

picked.

GENE

I don't know. One of them is following

me. If he knew what I'd just told

you they'd...

GENE

Look, how did I get in here with

this!?

KRISTA

I don't know.

GENE

You've got to trust me. I'm putting

my daughter's life in your hands.

She's only six. She's just a little

girl. Please, please, trust me.

KRISTA

It's a little hard to trust you under

the circumstances.

GENE

You're right, it is.

(beat)

Here.

GENE

Will you trust me now?

KRISTA

I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's

one person we can go to.

GENE

The man following me has a walkie-

talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll

call his partner. I do anything out

of line and he'll send the word to

kill my daughter.

KRISTA

He'll think you're in the crowd until

the end of the speech. Wait a minute.

ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.)

...I remember that horrible night as

if it were yesterday. A phone call

pulling me out of sleep, the terrible

news...

ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.)

My husband and child senselessly

killed by a drunk driver.

KRISTA

We've got about ten minutes.

GENE

Are you sure?

KRISTA

I've heard this speech a lot. Come

on. We'll take care of him.  We will.

GENE

But...

KRISTA

Trust me. You asked me for help. Let

me help. Trust me.

GENE

Okay...

GENE

Hey.

GENE

I think you better put that away.

KRISTA

I think you're right.

ELEANOR GRANT

But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy

us, has a curious way of giving us

strength.

ELEANOR GRANT

I doubt if I would be before you

now, if I hadn't been put through

that crucible of loss.

ELEANOR GRANT

And though I can never forget William

and Bill Junior or the love I felt

for them...

ELEANOR GRANT

I have found joy again in serving

this great state. I have found love

again in my second husband Brendan...

GENE

Where are we going?

HALL GUARD

Ms. Brooks ...

KRISTA

Is he in?

HALL GUARD

Yes, ma'am.

GENE

Who is this? Are you sure we can

trust him?

KRISTA

I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her

Campaign Manager.

BRENDAN GRANT

What is it? Is there a problem?

KRISTA

We need to see you, Brendan.

GENE

(to KRISTA)

We have to hurry.

KRISTA

I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone

is trying to kill Eleanor.

BRENDAN GRANT

What? What are you talking about?

KRISTA

We need people we can "trust. We

only have a few moments...

BRENDAN GRANT

This is...this is insane. How do you

know this?

GENE

I know it because I'm the one who's

supposed to kill her.

BRENDAN GRANT

You are!?

(to KRISTA)

You brought this man here!? You

brought this man to my room!?

KRISTA

I had to. Her Security people may be

involved...

MYSTERY MAN

Is there a problem, Brendan?

BRENDAN GRANT

There certainly is. This man says

he's been hired to kill Eleanor.

GENE

Not hired. They're blackmailing me.

MYSTERY MAN

Who is this "they"?

GENE

I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr.

Grant! They have my daughter. I'm

not some lunatic. Your wife is in

trouble.  Someone is trying to kill

her. Someone is trying to make me

kill her. Please, listen...

MYSTERY MAN

And on the strength of this story,

you bring this man to Brendan's suite?

Does that show good judgment, Ms.

Brooks?  I'm just a friend of

Brendan's, but it seems to me...

KRISTA

He brought a gun onto the pool deck.

MYSTERY MAN

(beat)

What?

KRISTA

He got onto the pool deck with a

gun. How did he get past her Security

carrying a

MYSTERY MAN

I see. Where is this gun?

KRISTA I

Have it.

MYSTERY MAN

Well, is it real? Do we know anything

about it?

KRISTA

It looks real. I don't know anything

about guns.

MYSTERY MAN

Could I see it?

MYSTERY MAN

My goodness. It certainly looks real.

MYSTERY MAN

What's your opinion? You're the expert

in these matters, supposedly.

BRENDAN GRANT

Jesus Christ!

MR. SMITH

(calmly, staring at

GENE)

Yeah, I'd say it's real.

MYSTERY MAN

Are you out of your fucking mind!?

OFFICER TRUST

Somebody mind telling me...

(sees KRISTA's body))

What the hell happened!?

MR. SMITH

Help me get her off the rug.

BRENDAN GRANT

What have you done to me!? Christ

almighty!

GENE

No!

MR. SMITH

You fucked up.

MYSTERY MAN (O.S.)

That's enough.

MR. SMITH

You want me to kill your kid!? You

want me to kill you!?

MYSTERY MAN

Don't let him go!

GENE

I killed you.

MR. SMITH

You fucked up.

MYSTERY MAN (O.S.)

You nearly killed him, too, you idiot!

MR. SMITH (O.S.)

Nearly doesn't count.

BRENDAN GRANT

I'm on record. I never wanted this.

I wanted simplicity; a telescopic

sight, a powerful rifle, but no.

What was good enough for Oswald wasn't

good enough for you two. You had to

get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off

the street, stick a gun in his hand.

MYSTERY MAN

It's academic now. She had to be

killed.

MR. SMITH

What were you going to do, Brendan?

Lock her in a closet?  You're in the

fucking kitchen now. Get used to the

heat. He's been seen all over the

hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes.

We even got him on video. It'll work.

Don't worry about it.

MYSTERY MAN

(about GENE) Is he awake?

MR. SMITH

Yeah.

BRENDAN GRANT

Oh Great. Why don't we just give him

our home phone numbers while we're

at it?

MR. SMITH

It doesn't matter what he hears.

MR. SMITH

That's what it looks like. She was

alive a minute ago. Now she's dead.

Because you wouldn't do what I told

you to do.

MYSTERY MAN

Get going. You've only got a few

minutes to pull it together.

MYSTERY MAN

It's too late for that.

BRENDAN GRANT

There is a dead woman on my bathroom

floor!

MYSTERY MAM

What about it? She's Eleanor's

assistant and they will have been

shot with the same gun, by the same

lunatic.  Some, anonymous loser who

went over the edge.

BRENDAN GRANT

(breathing easier)

Only thing better would be if he

were a postal worker.

OFFICER TRUST

He won't be doing any work once I

get through with him.

MYSTERY MAN

And in a few months you're in the

Governor's mansion. The people'd

make you king of California if they

could.

GENE

I'm not stupid.. I know how this is

supposed, to work.

MR. SMITH

Do you now, Mr. Watson?

GENE

I kill her - and you kill me.

MR. SMITH

Keep your voice down.

GENE

Even if you don't, Her Security men

will.

GENE

How am I supposed to get away?

MR. SMITH

That's not my problem, Mr. Watson

MR. SMITH

(into the walkie-talkie)

Come back.

GENE

How do I know you won't kill my

daughter once I'm gone?

MR. SMITH

(into the walkie-talkie)

Come Back....Fucking Radio.

MR.SMITH

I told you she'd be alright, if you

do your job.

GENE

And I'm supposed to trust you?

MR. SMITH

What choice do you have?

MR. SMITH

After you.

MR. SMITH

Look out there! You see the van?

MR. SMITH

You see it?!

MR. SMITH

Come back.

MS. JONES (V.O.)

(filtered)

Yeah.

MR. SMITH

Do it!

LYNN (V.O.)

(filtered)

Daddy...?

GENE

Lynn!

MR. SMITH

Security. Take the next car.

MR. SMITH

Again.

GENE

(a gasp)

No, please...

MR. SMITH

You got one last chance. Half an

hour and that kid is dead. I'll kill

her myself. I'll rip her fucking

head off right in front of you!

LYNN (O.S.)

(filtered, giggling)

Daddy, did you hear me scream?

LYNN (O.S.)

She told me to scream as loud as I

could. Did you hear me?

MR. SMITH

The next time I tell you to do

something, you goddamn well do it!

MS. JONES

Hey, fuck you! You want to baby-sit

a screaming kid in traffic, come out

here and do it yourself. He got the

message, didn't he?

HUEY (O.S.)

Having a rough day? Down at the heels

as they say? What you need is a shoe

shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.

HUEY

(still not looking up)

Take ten, take a break, take a seat,

take a load off. Put the world in

perspective.

HUEY

So, are you a visitor or are you

lucky enough to...

HUEY

(as he looks up)

You got a complaint?

GENE

You remember me?

HUEY

I remember. The big tipper.

GENE

Something is going to happen. When

it's over you'll know what I was

talking about.

HUEY

Oh, man...

GENE

Please. Something is going to

happen...

HUEY

What? The end of the world? Man,

don't give me your mad rap. I'm not

a bartender. I don't want to hear

it. I raise a family doing this

bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your

crazy white ass out of my chair.

GENE

Please...

HUEY

Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the

right to crap in my ear. You want

change?  You got it, brother. What

was that you gave me, a twenty?

MR. SMITH

Come on, let's get some privacy.

GENE

He's deaf.

GENE

He can't hear a word we're saying.

MR. SMITH

You wouldn't be kidding me now, would

you, Mr. Watson?

(to HUEY's back)

Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't

hear me? Nigger?

HUEY

Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient

just got multiplied by two. What do

you think of that?  You'll have to

forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your

approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm

deef as a post. Compliments of the

United States Army...

(does a snappy salute)

...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a

shine, sir? You don't see your face,

you don't pay.

MR. SMITH

(loudly)

Yeah, sure, give me a shine...

(looks at GENE)

...shine.

MR. SMITH

I'm putting your toy back in your

pocket, Mr. Watson.

MR. SMITH

It's all wound up. Now let's get out

your itinerary.

GENE

One thirty. California Ballroom.

MR. SMITH

(glances at HUEY)

That's right. That gives you...

MR. SMITH

...twenty-six minutes to get your

shit together.

GENE

Let me talk to her again.

MR. SMITH

No.

GENE

I want'to talk to her.

MR. SMITH

Forget about it.

GENE

I talk to her or you can forget about

it.

MR. SMITH

Don't you threaten me.

GENE

What are you going to do about it,

shoot me?

MR. SMITH

(glances again at HUEY) You know

what I'm gonna do.

GENE

What? Walk out there and twist her

arm off?

GENE

It would be a lot less trouble just

to let me talk to her.

MR. SMITH

(into it)

Come Back.

MS. JONES (O.S.)

(filtered)

Yeah.

MR. SMITH

Put her on.

MS. JONES (O.S.)

What gives?

MR. SMITH

Just put her on.

LYNN (O.S.)

(filtered)

Daddy?

GENE

Yes, sweetie, it's me.

LYNN (O.S.)

(filtered)

I'm tired. I want to.go now.

GENE

I know you do, honey.

LYNN

Can we go now?

GENE (O.S.)

(filtered)

Not just yet, baby. There's...there's

something Daddy has to do.

LYNN

To be a hero?

GENE

No, honey, not to be a hero. But I

want you to remember something for

me, all right?

LYNN (O.S.)

(filtered)

All right.

GENE

He's doing it for you. No matter

what anybody tells you, no matter

who they are, he's doing it for you,

because he loves you.

MR. SMITH

That's enough.

GENE

Will you promise me that?

LYNN (O.S.)

(filtered)

I promise.

GENE

All right. Kisses to you.

LYNN (O.S.)

(filtered)

No...kisses to you.

GENE

No. Kisses to you.

LYNN (O.S.)

(filtered)

No, kisses to...

MR. SMITH

I don't care who the fuck you do it

for just so you do it. Hey.

MR. SMITH

You done yet?

HUEY

Just about.

HUEY

Two dollars, if it pleases you.

MR. SMITH

It doesn't. I remember when it was a

fuckin' quarter.

MR. SMITH

Twenty-five minutes.

HUEY

Thanks for the tip.

HUEY

Mister, what are you dragging me

into?

GENE

I'm not dragging you into anything.

I don't expect...

HUEY

Cover your mouth.

GENE

What?

HUEY

This gorilla's watching you, is that

right?

GENE

That's right.

HUEY

Then don't let him be seeing you

talking to me. I don't want him

twisting my arm off.

HUEY

That was your kid on the walkie-

talkie?

GENE

My daughter. They have her in a van

across the street. They say they'll

kill her if I don't do something for

them.

HUEY

In twenty-five minutes in the

California Ballroom.

GENE

There was a woman. She was trying to

help me. I watched him murder her.

HUEY

What are you supposed to do?

GENE

Kill the Governor.

HUEY

I knew I should have packed up and

gone home as soon as I got that

twenty. What am I supposed to do

about this situation?

GENE

One of them is in on it. He might

even be in charge. Her Security is

in on it. There's only one person I

know for sure isn't in on it.

HUEY

Who?

GENE

The Governor. If I could just talk

to her...

HUEY

Oh, Jesus ...

GENE

No way, there's nothing you can do

to help me.

HUEY

Then why'd you drag me into it?

GENE

(getting emotional)

It's my kid. I've got to...to

somehow...do right by my little girl.

GENE

It's about time I did. I was one of

those guys, workaholics. I worked my

ass off for them - my wife, my

daughter.  That's just what I thought

I was supposed to do.

HUEY

Yeah, all right, listen...

GENE

(running on)

So when she wanted a divorce...I

was...I didn't know what I'd done

wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see

it....

HUEY

Why don't you tell me about the early

years some other time?

GENE

I'm sorry. You understand I don't

mind dying if I could save my

daughter. I mean that.

HUEY

Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with

these shoes any more or it's gonna

look funny. You go down get yourself

something to drink. Make sure Godzilla

there, follows you.

GENE

What are you going to do?

HUEY

I haven't the faintest idea. Go on

now. I'll get word to you.

GENE

If nothing else, someone heard my

story.

GENE

Keep the change.

HUEY

Don't think I won't.

GENE

I need a drink.

GAME SHOW HOST (O.S.)

(over television)

...and time is running out...

GENE

Give me a ...a gingerale?

T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1

Man, I thought she was going to get

out the violins.

TV REPORTER

No shit. If I hear that stop the

violence routine one more time I'm

going to shoot somebody.

WAITRESS

Here's your Ginger Ale, sir.

DOWN THE BAR:

T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1 Politicians.

TV REPORTER

They're all the same.

TV REPORTER

You know what bothers me?

TV REPORTER

When they get all weepy eyed about

the "ordinary citizen", the "regular

Joe", the "normal American". Gimme a

break. There ain't no such animal.

We're a nation of two hundred forty

million special interest groups.

GENE

Well, I'm just a regular guy.

TV REPORTER

Is that right?

GENE

Yeah, that's right. But I've built a

good solid business out of nothing.

Don't underestimate the regular guy.

BARTENDER

Sir, you haven't paid.

GENE

It's on the Special Interest at the

end of the bar.

BARTENDER

Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop.

T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1

Left field bleachers heard from.

T.V. REPORTER

Laughs.

OFFICER TRUST

Where is he? Did you lose him?

MR. SMITH

Shut up.

GENE

(sotto voice)

Let's all hope so.

HUEY

Quick, off with the shoes and pants.

Trade with Gustino. The big guy's

coming.

HUEY

C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy.

HUEY

Gustino! Drop 'em!

HUEY

And cover up them socks. Man, who

dresses you?

JANITOR

Fue.  (Gone.)

HUEY

Meet Irene.

GENE

Hi.

HUEY

Irene is going to help.

GENE

Thank you.

GENE

Where am I going?

HUEY

You said there was only one person

you knew wasn't in on this thing.

GENE

Yeah.

HUEY

You're going to go see her.

GENE

What!?

HUEY

You sure she's asleep?

IRENE

I took up extra pillows. She take a

nap before her big speech.

GENE

What am I supposed to say to her?

HUEY

It'll come to you. See if you can

stop this thing 'fore it gets started.

Save us all considerable

embarrassment.

HUEY

(shocked)

Irene...?

GENE

(softly)

Excuse me...

ELEANOR GRANT

Who the hell are you?

GENE

No, please.

GENE

Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt

you.

ELEANOR GRANT

My security people are right next

door.

GENE

I appreciate that.

ELEANOR GRANT

One loud scream will bring them in

here instantly. You won't get very

far. Think it over.

GENE

If I were here to hurt you I would

have done it already.

ELEANOR GRANT

That's...a comfort to hear.

GENE

I have a problem.

ELEANOR GRANT

Ah.

GENE

Only you can help me. I'm also sorry

to say, my problem is your problem,

Mrs. Grant.

ELEANOR GRANT

I remember you...in the elevator.

GENE

That's right.

ELEANOR GRANT

You were very nervous.

GENE

It was because I had this...in my

pocket

GENE

I need you to listen to me. Carefully.

Three lives depend on you listening

very carefully to what I have to

say.

ELEANOR GRANT

(friendly as can be)

Of course. But suppose we set up an

appointment. I have an important

speech to deliver and you're cutting

into my nap time.

GENE

Krista Brooks is dead.

ELEANOR GRANT

How do you know that?

GENE

I saw her die. She was shot. With

this gun.

ELEANOR GRANT

You shot her?

GENE

No.

ELEANOR GRANT

Who did?

GENE

I don't know. The only thing I know

about him is that he works for your

husband.

ELEANOR GRANT

What?

GENE

And your husband works for somebody

else.

ELEANOR GRANT

What the hell are you saying?

HECTOR

He's gone.

HECTOR

Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long?

You need to eat more fiber.

GUSTINO (O.S.)

You got anything to read?

GENE

I knew you wouldn't believe me.

ELEANOR GRANT

I said I'd listen to you, not

necessarily believe you. You're

telling me my people are in a plot

against me. You're telling me my

husband wants me killed. What do you

expect?

GENE

I don't blame you. I don't have any

proof. But nothing like this occurs

in a vacuum. You can't be totally

oblivious. You must suspect something.

You're doing things which are making

people angry. People who have been

in power a long time are losing their

jobs. You know them better than me.

How much does it mean to them?  How

far would they go to hang onto it?

GENE

There's only one way to find out for

sure. Try to cancel the last speech.

ELEANOR GRANT

(smiling, covering

her inner thought)

I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as

my last speech.

GENE

It's the last chance they have for

me to kill you. Try to get out of

it. They won't let you. They can't.

Try to change the schedule and you'll

know I'm right. What have you got to

lose? It comes down to who you trust,

them or me? Test them.

ELEANOR GRANT

I love it when pistolero's talk of

trust.

GENE

This? I've never even fired one.

ELEANOR GRANT

Indeed.

ELEANOR GRANT

(in the blackness)

Franco! Franco.'

FRANCO

What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!?

ELEANOR GRANT

I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream,

Franco.

HUEY

Well?

GENE

I don't know.

HUEY

What are you going to do now?

GENE

I don't know. I have to get back.

HUEY

What are you going to do!?

GENE

This is about power and you haven't

got any. There's nothing more you

can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.

OFFICER TRUST (O.S.)

(alarmed)

Where is he?

MR. SMITH

In the john.

OFFICER TRUST

Get moving.

MR. SMITH

You' oughta learn to relax. I told

you I've got it under control.

OFFICER TRUST

It's time. It's time now.

LYNN

Where are we going?

MS. JONES

Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at

all.

MR. SMITH

Out of there, Mr. Watson! Your time's

up!

MR. SMITH

You forgot to wash your hands.

MR. SMITH

I've got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I

know you're not just a regular guy,

see, I know that. Even if you don't

know it yourself. Maybe that's why I

picked you.

GENE

I know what I have to do. I'll do

it. Let's go.

BRENDAN GRANT

Hey, El, how's the head?

MYSTERY MAN

Eleanor.

ELEANOR GRANT

Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm

thinking of canceling the speech.

BRENDAN GRANT

It's an important speech.

MYSTERY MAN

I'd say critical, not that it's any

of my business.

ELEANOR GRANT

It's just another speech in a Tower

of Babel so high that Nimrod himself

would be put to shame. Cancel. Make

my apologies.

BRENDAN GRANT

Excuse me.

MYSTERY MAN

I'll trot along. Nice to see you,

Eleanor.

BRENDAN GRANT

During a campaign every speech is

important. This is free media

exposure. Primetime news coverage

that we couldn't buy.

ELEANOR GRANT

What's he doing here?

BRENDAN GRANT

Who, him? Just visiting.

ELEANOR GRANT T

Hings have changed, Brendan. I thought

you understood that.

BRENDAN GRANT

He's my friend. And he did help you

to get elected, after all.

ELEANOR GRANT

Don't remind me.

BRENDAN GRANT

(re the broken lamp)

What happened here?

ELEANOR GRANT

Nothing. I broke a lamp.

BRENDAN GRANT

Eleanor, please. I'll put it this

way. This speech or a half-dozen

rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do

you say?

ELEANOR GRANT

Truth is, besides the headache I've

come down with a little lower

intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.

BRENDAN GRANT

Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll

get you some Pepto, you'll make one

of your patented tributes to the

common person, then back to

Sacramento. This is no time to lay

down on the job. I don't care what

the polls say, you can't afford to

relax. Look what happened to Bush.

Tell you what, if you want to blow

off the Sacramento speech, fine. But

do this one and we'll get out of the

smog.

ELEANOR GRANT

All right, I'll do it.

BRENDAN GRANT

That's my girl.

ELEANOR GRANT

But I want to make some changes. Get

Krista in here right away won't you?

BRENDAN GRANT

Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.

ELEANOR GRANT

You sent my assistant on an errand.

BRENDAN GRANT

(trying to look

sheepish)

I've been a bad boy.

POLITICO

Ladies, gentlemen, it is my great

pleasure to introduce to you the

esteemed spouse of our Governor.

Let's give a big L.A. welcome to Mr.

Brendan Grant.

BRENDAN GRANT

Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

campaign volunteers, and those of

you who were looking for any excuse

to take off work for the afternoon...

BRENDAN GRANT

We have with us today the first woman

Governor of our great state...

BRENDAN GRANT

Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. What

can I say about her....that won't

get me in trouble when I get home

tonight.

T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN

Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, are you

reading me?

BRENDAN GRANT

She's a woman who loves our great

state.

T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN

Charlie...

(gives it up)

I can't get shit on this stupid radio.

BRENDAN GRANT

A brilliant legislator.

BRENDAN GRANT

...who will soon win her second term

as the greatest Governor California

has ever seen!

T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN

Somebody's going to ave to run down

to the truck. Tell them this radio's

fucked.

T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN

I can't get through. Walkie-Talkies

don't work from here. There's too

much concrete and stuff.

BRENDAN GRANT

Ladies and gentlemen...

T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN

Nothin's getting out.

BRENDAN GRANT

I am honored to present to you our

esteemed Governor and my beloved

wife, Eleanor Samara Grant!

ELEANOR GRANT

Thank you! Thank you all!

GENE

Look out! Look out!

GENE

Look out!

BRENDAN GRANT

My God, he did it!

OFFICER TRUST

You little son of a bitch.

ELEANOR GRANT

Are you all right, Franco?

FRANCO

(painfully)

I'd be better if they'd put sleeves

on these damn vests.

MS. JONES

(on the walkie talkie)

It's time....You read me?  I don't

hear from you I'm going ahead now.

LYNN

Why do you keep looking at me?

MS. JONES

That's my job. I'm your babysitter.

LYNN

I'm not a baby.

MS. JONES

You're a big girl, huh?

LYNN

I'm not a big girl but I'm not a

baby.

MS. JONES

Close your eyes.

LYNN

Why?

MS. JONES

I've got something for you.

LYNN

A surprise?

MS. JONES

You ask too many questions. You want

the surprise or not?

HUEY

Good afternoon, madam. Hello there,

little girl.

MS. JONES

Hey, hey, what are you doing!?

HUEY

Just giving you the gift of a clean

windshield. Only cost you a dollar.

MS. JONES

I don't want my windshield cleaned.

HUEY

You just think you don't want your

windshield cleaned.

MS. JONES

No, I know I don't want it cleaned.

Get out of here.

HUEY

Don't be like that. Think of me as

the Moses of dirty windshields leading

you through the desert of dead bugs.

MS. JONES

For the last time, I don't want it

cleaned. Now get the hell out of

here!

HUEY

It's already done. I've already done

it. You have to pay me now.

MS. JONES

I don't have to pay you nothin'.

HUEY

You're going to deny me a lousy dollar

after I've sweated like a pig giving

you the gift of a clean windsheild?

MS. JONES

Fuckin' A.

HUEY

I don't think so.

MS. JONES

Hey!

HUEY

I think this is worth a dollar.

MS. JONES

Goddamnit! Gimme that!

HUEY

Oh, we'll have to do better than

that.

MS. JONES

You worthless piece of shit! Gimme

that!

MS. JONES

Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come

here!

HUEY

Gimme a dollar.

MS. JONES

Fuck you!

MS. JONES

Gimme that thing!

MS. JONES

Goddammit, give it to me, you

Sunnavabitch!

MR. SMITH

Daddy blew it.

MR. SMITH

Very good...Mr. Watson. I told

them...I could make a killer out of

you.

HUEY

There's nothing like a good wing-

tip.

HUEY

What time is it?

GENE

Lost my watch.

ELEANOR GRANT

Any comment at this time would be

most premature. Please, we'll have

something for you in a couple of

hours. Please...

ELEANOR GRANT

I...1 would like to...thank you,

Mister Wat... Gene.

ELEANOR GRANT

I would also like to apologize.

GENE

For what?

ELEANOR GRANT

For not believing you.

GENE

Believe me, I don't blame you.

(to LYNN)

This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.

ELEANOR GRANT

You have a very brave father, Lynn.

LYNN

He's a hero.

ELEANOR GRANT

Yes, yes he is.

LYNN

Dads are like that.

GENE

Can we go now?

ELEANOR GRANT

Of course. I'll get a car to drive

you.

GENE

No, that's... That's OK. We don't

need any help. We'll be just fine.

Won't we, Lynn?

ELEANOR GRANT

Good luck.

GENE

Same to you.

GENE

Thanks for the shine.

HUEY

Thanks for the tip.

GENE

(to LYNN)

Come on, kid. I gotta make a phone

call.

HUEY

Kisses to you.

LYNN

No, kisses to you!

HUEY

No, kisses to you.

FADE OUT:

THE END
