CARL

Hey.

RAY

Hey. Nice tie.

CARL

Don't get too attached.

RAY

Ya got the paper?

CARL

Yeah.

RAY

You're my hero, Carl.

CARL

Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm

shakin', man, look at me.

RAY

Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.

RAY

Anyone stops us going in, we're with

the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company.

We have rug samples.

CARL

Rug samples.

RAY

We are one-dimensional, boring

peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.

BLACK MAN

Hey, look who's here.

RAY

Louis, my man, what's happenin'?

FENCE MAN

Clean ones?

RAY

Immaculate.

FENCE MAN

What ya got there, seventy-five

thousand?

CARL

A hundred and ten. Count it.

LOUIS (BLACK MAN)

Have the girl count it, we can't sit

around here countin' bonds, we got

things to do here.

FENCE MAN

SALLLLY!

LOUIS

F.B.I.! Get your face on the fuckin'

floor! MOVE!

RAY

Slam dunk.

LOUIS

Beauty. Beauty...

CARL

Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu--

Larry. That's not even your name, is

it? What's your real name, you fucking

scumbag?

RAY

Don't have one, Carl. I have a number,

man. Just like the numbers on those

treasury checks. You stole from your

own country, Carl. Shame on you.

LOUIS

Sugar Ray.

LOUIS

They want ya Home. Upstairs wants to

see ya.

LOUIS

Make sure ya spell my name right.

CARL

(incredulous)

We just spent four months together...

I thought he was my friend... what

the fuck, man?

(even more incredulous)

He had dinner at my mother's.

INTERCOM

SA Levoi, Sir.

TULLY

Please.

TULLY

Ray...

RAY

Mister Tully.

TULLY

Do you want a coffee?

RAY

No. No, no. Thank you.

TULLY

Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal

Division.

COOCH

Oh, yeah -- right.

TULLY

Ray this is --

RAY / TULLY

Frank Couture.

TULLY

That's right.

COUTURE

Hello, Ray.

RAY

It's an honor.

TULLY

Ray, we're taking you off the street.

We need you out in South Dakota.

RAY

South Dakota...

(confused)

Did I do something unsatisfactory,

Sir?

COOCH

No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame

that on your grandmother.

TULLY

Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.

(scanning file)

French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and

one-eighth American Indian.

COOCH

Sioux Indian, right?

RAY

I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --

TULLY

-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.

TULLY

Ray, there's been a homicide out in

an area known as The Badlands. Indian

Reservation.

COOCH

It's not the first. There's been

several. And our field office in

Rapid City is getting a lot of heat...

none of the investigations have turned

up jack shit.

TULLY

The main problem is, Ray, these people

are extremely distrustful of

outsiders, non-Indians. Relations

have not been amicable.

COOCH

Different culture. Hard to penetrate.

The Indians don't like white cops

poking around. And that's why we're

in a position where we have to bring

in an American Indian agent.

TULLY

With an Indian representative out

there, we hope to keep hostilities

dormant; this is a COINTELPRO,

Selective Operations Unit, and it'll

be easier on Agent Couture if you

can gain the people's trust and maybe --

RAY

Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what

you're saying... I've got a little

Indian blood, that's true. But --

(laughing)

I am not an... an Indian. I can't

just go in and --

TULLY

-- your father was part Sioux.

RAY

I didn't know him, Sir. He passed

away when I was six.

COOCH

Seven.

COOCH

Don't worry about it, Ray. As long

as the people have proof that we

sent them one of their own, no one's

gonna ask you to weave baskets or

make it rain.

RAY

Eight murders in less than a year.

All of them Indian. All of them

unsolved. Is the law a non-entity

out here or what?

COOCH

Those are two agents who went into a

reservation a few years ago to serve

a warrant. They were executed at

close range. That one there is a

police officer killed by the Mohawks

up in Canada more recently.

RAY

Jesus...

COOCH

The agents who have worked out here

say its like going into Nam.

Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language,

foreign customs... and you never

know when you might walk into a few

rounds. They hold a lot of old anger

for the white man out here.

RAY

Were you in Nam?

COOCH

Airborne. That's where they used to

get us agents from. Now we get 'em

from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League.

Accountants and computer whiz-kids.

Yuppies with guns.

(lights a smoke)

That's scary shit.

RAY

Not as scary as a Hoover man with a

computer.

COOCH

Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've

loved you. He'd love anybody who

joined the bureau to, what was it?

"To enforce the laws of my country

and protect her interests"?

RAY

You crashed my file?

COOCH

No. I consulted it. We're going into

Indian Country, I wanna know what

kind of individual is covering my

ass. Don't you?

RAY

You've been in the bureau for thirty

years. You survived The Hoov, the

Black Panthers and Abscam. I don't

see any bullet holes. That's good

enough for me.

COOCH

Who found him?

MILES

Indian kids. Hunting fossils.

COOCH

Okay. I think Agent Levoi and I can

proceed from here. What are your

call signals?

SHERMAN

PX-10 and 11. Anything we can do to

help you out, just radio.

COOCH

Good. Thanks, Guys.

RAY

Leo Fast Elk... Thirty seven...

single... Member of the Tribal

Council.

COOCH

Looks like Fast Elk wasn't fast enough

to outrun that load. What do you

make of the damage?

RAY

Six rounds. 357.

COOCH

That's what it looks like, doesn't

it? But that's what a ten gauge,

choke-bored, shotgun will look like

when it hits your lower back from

five feet away.

RAY

Somebody was serious about doing

this guy, that's for sure.

COOCH

Ray.

COOCH

Good morning.

COOCH

Taking ol' Leo somewhere?

CROW HORSE

Leo's been out here too long, man.

I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.

RAY

This is a restricted area.

COOCH

Check him out, Ray.

COOCH

Nice piece. You come back here to

cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's

your name?

CROW HORSE

It ain't Geronimo.

COOCH

Who are you?

CROW HORSE

I think maybe you guys got off the

wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear

Creek Indian Reservation.

COOCH

I know where I am. I'm on federal

land, doing a federal investigation,

and if you don't wanna cooperate you

can take a ride in a federal car,

and spend the rest of the day in a

little room, answering federal

questions. It's your call. Who are

you?

CROW HORSE

I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born

and raised on this reservation.

COOCH

You're a wise-ass. Ray check his

wallet.

RAY

I did.

COOCH

Who the fuck is he?

RAY

-- a fucking cop.

RAY

Walter Crow Horse. Tribal Police.

COOCH

He's a fucking cop.

CROW HORSE

We got the wire ya was comin'. You're

the Indian official, yeah?

COOCH

No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...

(searching his

imagination)

Ray... Little Weasel.

CROW HORSE

Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother.

He's gotta make the journey.

COOCH

What journey?

CROW HORSE

Tell him, Ray.

RAY

Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.

COOCH

We'll have to give Leo a refund.

Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In

case you don't know, Officer,

violation of the Major Crimes Act on --

CROW HORSE

-- an Indian Reservation is within

the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau

of Intimidation. I know that.

COOCH

Good. Thank you.

CROW HORSE

I said when can Leo be taken to

ceremony?

RAY

After we've completed our

investigation.

CROW HORSE

That's a nice suit.

COOCH

Somebody must be doing something

somewhere in your jurisdiction,

Officer Crow Foot.

CROW HORSE

You ain't gonna cut his hands off

and send 'em to Washinton, are ya?

They done that to one of our girls

once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna

need his hands.

RAY

Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch.

He does quillwork.

COOCH

I think Leo's retired from quillwork

for the moment.

CROW HORSE

Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --

COOCH

-- did you understand me when I said

that --

CROW HORSE

(walking away)

-- violation of the Major Crimes Act

on an Indian Reservation is within

the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau

of Instigation. I know that.

COOCH

Goodbye.

COOCH

What the hell you doing?!

CROW HORSE

His mother needs a piece of his hair.

It's for the Keeping of the Souls

Ceremony.

(wrapping lock of

hair)

Has to be kept for four days.

COOCH

Keeping of the souls. Do they still

burn their dead or something?

RAY

Beats the hell outta me.

COOCH

Sorry, Ray. You're gonna have to

wait in the car. I'll bring you out

a cheeseburger.

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey!

CLEAR MOON

(heavy Indian accent)

You made it. Was-te.

COOCH

You must be... President Clear Bone.

CLEAR MOON

Clear Moon.

(pointing to the sky)

Moon. You must be the Sioux.

COOCH

No. That's Ray here. Ray...

RAY

(quickly)

Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.

CLEAR MOON

It's about time they sent us one of

our own. Was-te.

CLEAR MOON

Things are no good here. It is like

war zone. We need an official who

understands what is good for the

Indian people. Who knows Indian way.

RAY

I thought we were staying on the

reservation.

CLEAR MOON

Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are

on Indian land.

RAY

I see.

CLEAR MOON

Are you hungry? I have some nice raw

kidney in the truck.

RAY

Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.

COOCH

He's starving, Mr. Clear Moon. Get

him some raw kidney. He hasn't had

any Indian food in days...

WHITE LOCAL

Where you goin'? Back to the res?

WHITE LOCAL

What ya doin'? You drunk?

COOCH

Let's take a walk.

COOCH

What's goin' on here?

(a beat)

I can't walk across the goddamn street

without some breed-ass fallin' all

over me?

COOCH

Watch out now, he wants a kiss, Ray,

wants a kiss --

COOCH

Go ahead, skin, get your ass back on

your sacred land. Get outta here.

COOCH

Get outta here. Drive.

DENNIS

So what type of salesmen are you

gentlemen anyway?

RAY

Liquor. We heard they like their

drink on the reservation, and we

were gonna see if we couldn't unload

some surplus on the way to Nebraska.

COOCH

Now keep that between us, Dennis,

cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny

Law they got here.

DENNIS

Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want

you to meet a coupla fellas from

Denver.

DENNIS

Liquor salesmen. Be nice to them,

maybe they'll give you a sample of

some of that gin you like.

(to Ray)

He likes that Russian shit that --

BROOKS

They ain't liquor salesmen. They're

FBI.

COOCH

Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow

like you, doing in a joint like this?

Let me buy you a glass of some of

that Russian shit you like.

DENNIS

FBI? What you investigatin'?

COOCH

A murder. On the reservation.

DENNIS

Again. Figures, man.

BROOKS

You'll never find out who did it.

COOCH

You underestimate me, Brooks.

BROOKS

No. You underestimate these grass

niggers. They're killing each other.

That's all they do. Get drunk and

kill each other. Then cover for each

other. Who gives a damn really as

long as they stay on their

reservation. You ask me, the

government shouldn't care one

particle.

DENNIS

You know how in your big cities, you

got your niggers and you got your

Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got

Indians. That's just the way it is.

COOCH

The only good Indian is a dead Indian,

does that old adage still hold true

out here?

BROOKS

That set-to you saw out front, was

nothin' more than a message we were

sendin' to the sonsabitches that are

divertin' water from the river.

DENNIS

We got rights. We got a ranch just

up here.

RAY

Did any of you gentlemen know Leo

Fast Elk?

BROOKS

You fellas are here to investigate a

Indian crime, you should keep to

Indian land, and talk to them, not

us. But you wanna drink here and

shoot stick here, that's your right,

and we respect that.

(to Dennis)

Come on, Son, we're up on the table.

DENNIS

You fellas wanna play doubles?

RAY

Water. Worth killing for out here,

I'd think.

COOCH

Get the plate numbers off everyone

of these cars.

RAY

I already did.

RAY

Couldn't sleep.

COOCH

Good.

RECORDER

(locals)

-- out here we got our Indians. And

that's the way it is.

COOCH

By the time you get to the main

village, sun'll be up. I want you to

fraternize. Socialize. Penetrate.

Infiltrate. Eat some raw kidney, and

get these Indians talking. I'm gonna

Powwow with Big Chief Clear Moon and

find out more about Leo.

RAY

Done.

RAY

Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks-

Dreamer.

(a dry run)

Hello, I'm looking for Hobert Standing-

Buffalo-That-Walks... Dreamer.

RAY

Good morning. I'm looking for Hobert-

Buffalo-Dreaming...

(cheat sheet)

Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks--

RAY

--Dreamer.

RAY

Sir?

CROW HORSE

Ray Little Weasel. FBI. I like the

way ya sneaked up on me. Must be

Indian.

RAY

What are you --

CROW HORSE

Watch out!

RAY

What?!

CROW HORSE

You're steppin' on sign.

RAY

Hey.

(ignored)

Hey, you, listen up --

CROW HORSE

-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was

dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald

tread. Muffler held on with baling

wire.

CROW HORSE

The man you want... stepped outta

the car, dragged Leo out, laid him

down. Then walked over here and made

a circle in the earth with a stick.

I can't find the stick. He stuck an

eagle plume in the circle, got back

in his car, dustin' his own prints

with a pine bough for about six feet,

but he missed a print, right here,

see. He got in his car and went Hell-

bent-for-Holy-Sunday outta here. He

ditched that pine bough three miles

across the flat, in the Little Bear

River, it floated down to

Thundershield Gap. The car hit paved

road, and was outta here.

CROW HORSE

The killin' was done where Leo's

mother lives. But he was driven here

into these Badlands.

CROW HORSE

Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth

of that print, pressure releases...

I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --

RAY

Bullshit.

CROW HORSE

-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.

RAY

You're trying to tell me you can

read all that from a track?

CROW HORSE

No. Not just a track. You gotta listen

to the trees, man. To the leaves. To

this sand, you FBI's kicked all up.

You gotta listen to the earth.

RAY

Is that right? Well, listen to this:

drag your ass. This is a restricted

area.

CROW HORSE

No, this is the home of the Oglala

Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who

killed Leo. Whether you get him or I

get him, I just want him. Shit's

been goin' on too long.

RAY

You've got no jurisdiction.

CROW HORSE

You got no know-how. About Indian

Way. Or about Jack Shit for that

matter.

RAY

Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow

Horse, but I just flew in from a

place called the Twentieth Century

where we have such things as

electrostatic tracking methods,

psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting;

I don't have to crawl around with

the scorpions and talk to the fucking

trees to get answers. Leo was killed

right here.

CROW HORSE

Go back to the M.E., take a look

inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me

how chicken feed got in there. Trust

me, there ain't chickens in the

Badlands. His mother's place is --

RAY

-- his mother never lived here. She

was from up in North Dakota.

CROW HORSE

I'm talkin' his spiritual mother.

Maisy Blue Legs.

RAY

His spiritual mother...

CROW HORSE

To us Indians, our spiritual relatives

are as close as family. I've got

seven mothers on this reservation.

Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of

them.

RAY

Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole.

I'm giving you a break. But if my

partner finds out you're here, you're

gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux

Falls Maximum Security.

CROW HORSE

Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.

CROW HORSE (O.S.)

Hey, Little Weasel.

CROW HORSE

You weigh one sixty-three, yeah? Not

a beer drinker. You're one of these

tofu and pilaf characters. Pack your

gun, under your coat -- left shoulder.

But you got backup; a little .32,

.38 maybe, in a ankle holster that

gives you a right foot drag, Shoes

are too tight at the toe but, man,

they look cool. And that's what

counts.

RAY

Crow Horse.

RAY

Fuck you.

RAY

Mrs... Blue Legs? Can I ask you a

few questions --

MAISY

(1/3 res speed)

-- go away. Leave us alone...

RAY

Ma'am, Please --

RAY

Mrs. Blue Legs. I'm Indian.

RAY

I'm Sioux.

RAY

Yeah, right.

RAY

Shit. Mrs. Blue Legs! It's okay!

RADIO (COOCH)

X21, give me a 20.

RAY

(yelling)

Black Tail District, X22. You ready

for this? Leo wasn't killed in the

Badlands. I... I found the location.

COOCH

Maisy Blue Legs place?

RAY

How'd you know?

COOCH

I got one up on ya.

RAY

Go ahead.

COOCH

I've got the doer. I know who he is.

COOCH

Meet me at base. Over.

RAY

Cooch. You're my hero.

COOCH (O.S.)

Jimmy Looks Twice.

RAY

Who is he?

COOCH

One of the leaders of the Warriors

of All Red Nations. Militant

organization.

COOCH (O.S.)

The progressive Indians don't like

them because they want everybody to

go back to the old Indian ways, and

the old way Indians don't like them

because they use violence to get

attention.

RAY

White eagle feather through the

circle. That's their symbol.

COOCH

That's right.

RAY

They obviously wanted it to be known

that they offed Leo. Some kind of

statement.

COOCH

Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head

through a glass door of the tribal

offices three months ago. And

threatened him several times since.

President Clear Moon and the regional

FBI feel he made good on that threat.

RAY

I'd just like five minutes alone

with the motherfucker who hung that

flag upside down.

COOCH

Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my

ship. Now: remember what I told you

about Nam? Watch the grass, watch

the trees, watch the shit house, be

on your toes, and if we get committed,

don't hesitate to empty that sucker.

RAY

Alright. Alright.

COOCH

It's show time.

RAY

(whispering)

What the hell is that?

RAY

On the ground.

VOICE (O.S.)

(inside lodge)

Mitakue Oyasin!

COOCH

This is the FBI! Come on out of there

nice and slow. Let's move it! Hands

on your head!

RAY

Hands on your head, Sir. Come on,

come on...

LOOKS TWICE

(outraged)

What are you doing?

COOCH

James Looks Twice?

LOOKS TWICE

That's right. What are you doing

here? This is a religious ceremony

you're desecrating.

RAY

We're FBI, James. We just need to

ask you a few questions.

LOOKS TWICE

We are in the middle of a sweat lodge

ceremony. Do you drag people out of

your churches when they're in the

middle of prayer?

COOCH

Let's take a walk, Jimmy. Come on.

RAY

Go ahead. You can all go home.

COOCH

We just wanna take a look around

your place, Jimmy. We're not here to

bust your balls.

LOOKS TWICE

What's this about?

COOCH

Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.

LOOKS TWICE

You think I killed him? Cuz he was

an apple? Well, let me tell you

something about Leo, Man --

COOCH

-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's

the key?

COOCH

Ray, use the federal master key.

LOOKS TWICE

No. Don't do that. Don't deface the

property, man. The key's in there.

LOOKS TWICE

Inside... in the coffee can.

COOCH

There's no coffee can in --

COOCH

Jesus... Jesus...

COOCH

Get him...

COOCH

(into radio)

Assault on federal officers. Suspect

has left the area. One officer down.

Issue a Fugitive Alert immediately.

Over.

RADIO

Has the officer been shot, X-22?

COOCH

No, the officer's been bitten by a

fucking badger, okay? Get a Fugitive

Alert fucking now! Over.

CROW HORSE

You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya

walk like a penguin with a hard-on.

RAY

Is that right? What are the trees

saying today?

CROW HORSE

They're sayin' that nobody's gonna

talk to you cuz they don't give away

one of their own. But they did say

there's somebody way across the Little

Walking River who wants to talk to

you.

CROW HORSE

He sent me to find ya. He says he's

got information.

RAY

Let's go.

CROW HORSE

(with reverence)

Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty

medicine.

RAY

Medicine. As in medicine man?

RAY

Why does he wanna see me?

CROW HORSE

Good question. Hardly sees anybody

anymore. Hasn't left this place in

twenty years. Did you bring some

tobacco?

CROW HORSE

When you go see an elder, you always

bring some tobacco as a gift.

RAY

What did he say?

CROW HORSE

He wants to know if you ever watch

the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie

Monster is not to be trusted -- a

trickster.

CROW HORSE

He says there's something wrong with

Big Bird -- he's crazy,

(stops laughing)

He says you stopped the Inipi ceremony

last night...?

CROW HORSE

But he is not unhappy with you because

he knows you.

RAY

He knows me?

CROW HORSE

He says he saw you in a vision some

time ago.

CROW HORSE

I guess he had this vision some time

ago, in the Moon of the Popping Trees --

uh, back in the winter. He says you

come from Wasi'cu city in the East

but that your people... way back...

are of the Minniconjou Sioux. But

you yourself don't know that.

CROW HORSE

He says he knew you'd be coming to

Bear Creek. He was told. It is the

will of Tunkasilia -- the grandfather

that you come here. He says let's

smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe,

symbol of truth. So that there will

be no lies between us.

RAY

What's he smoke in that?

CROW HORSE

Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry,

we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture

in The Pipe. That's a white man's

myth. This is a sacrament.

GRANDPA

Mltaku Oyasin.

CROW HORSE

You don't smoke with him, it means

you're hiding something.

CROW HORSE

He says Wakan. Sacred. Five hundred

year old turtleshell rattle, passed

down from the Grandfathers. Heavy

duty.

CROW HORSE

He says, it is good. The Spirits are

here. The Spirits want to know what

you're doing here?

RAY

Tell him I'm trying to find the man

who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him

if he knows where he is.

RAY

What did he say?

CROW HORSE

He said he doesn't know.

RAY

He just did the Gettysburg Address

in Sioux. What did he say?

CROW HORSE

Uh... Grandpa likes to trade; no one

stops by here without gettin' stuck

in the old Indian barter. He, uh...

he likes your shades.

RAY

What was he saying?

CROW HORSE

Why should I tell you.

RAY

Because he was talking to me.

RAY

Does he know something?

CROW HORSE

The old man saw an owl. Over there

in the dry wash. Last week.

RAY

And...

CROW HORSE

He saw an owl.

RAY

So what?

CROW HORSE

The owl is a messenger. When one

shows itself to a Sioux... it means

someone's gonna die. The owl told

him about Leo.

RAY

The owl told him about Leo. That's

incredible. I guess we just broke

the back of this investigation, didn't

we? Evidence doesn't get any harder

than that -- not for my money. Is

there anyway we can seduce this owl

into Federal Court?

CROW HORSE

He also said "listen to the water."

RAY

Listen to the water. Listen to the

owl. He also said, don't trust the

fucking Cookie Monster.

CROW HORSE

Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.

CALLER

Was-te Yelo! Let's have five more

veterans. Five more veterans. Hoka

Hey!

CHASING HAWK

What is that that you honor there,

uncles? After all the Wasi'cu country

has done to you, after all he still

does to you, you honor that flag?!

That flag has been desecrated by the

United States, because they have not

honored what that flag represents!

CHASING HAWK (O.S.)

To them, we are the Bank of America.

Whenever they get into a little

difficulty, they go to The Bank,

withdraw a little land, withdraw a

little oil --

MILES

Okay. Here we go.

COOCH

Who's this guy?

SHERMAN

Anderson Chasing Hawk. Second in

command behind Jimmy.

SHERMAN

Magedelana Eagle Bear. Eagle's claws

and a bear's balls.

MILES

She keeps an AR-15 assault rifle in

her truck. And she'll use it.

RAY

Mr. Clear Moon.

CLEAR MOON

Our police are afraid of them. Please

get them out of here.

CLEAR MOON

They're going to kill me next. That's

what I hear. These new Indians are

destroying everything. Our people

are a quiet people.

RAY

They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let

them go. We're tightening the net on

him. We know he's on the reservation.

CLEAR MOON

Help us.

AGENT SHERMAN

Where's Jimmy? We thought he'd be

dancing today.

YELLOW BIRD

Are you the Washington Redskin?

AGENT MILES

Say hello to Richard Yellow Bird,

Ray.

COOCH

Ray, get to Jimmy's place and keep

it tight. I'm gonna get a tail on

his Warriors.

RAY

X22. Read.

RADIO

Go ahead, Ray.

RAY

I have a pick-up truck. No plates.

Subject -- Indian -- entering

suspect's house. Over.

RADIO

Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts

to leave the area, move in. And hold

him. Over.

RAY

FBI, freeze, Motherfucker -- drop

it, drop it!

RAY

Turn around, put your hands on the

roof of the truck.

MAGGIE

You're the Indian FBI.

RAY

That's right. Turn around.

MAGGIE

The people are glad they sent you.

They usually send in guys who come

at ya with highbeams, screamin' "drop

it, Motherfucker", stick a gun in

your face, frisk ya down. Even if ya

got a child with ya. No, it's good

to have ya. It's gonna be was-te

times on the res.

MAGGIE

I was gonna warn ya about messin'

with somebody's medicine bundle but

I forgot you know all about that

stuff.

RAY

This Jimmy's?

MAGGIE

You're not gonna catch him. He can

shape-shift into different animals.

Bear. Elk. Porcupine.

RAY

Is that like an hereditary thing,

Magdelana, or can one take classes?

MAGGIE

Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you

wanna do this?

RAY

He tried to kill him twice before.

That's a good place to start don't

ya think? Leo was on the other side,

wasn't he?

MAGGIE

-- Leo was an apple, that's right.

Red on the outside, white on the

inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked

his ass a coupla times. But he didn't

kill him.

RAY

Who did?

MAGGIE

You're the FBI. That's your job,

isn't it? Ya know how many of our

Warrior brothers got killed out here?

I never saw any investigating then.

Why now? What's going down here?

RAY

A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect.

Before somebody else gets a shotgun

blast in the spine.

MAGGIE

Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All

over again.

RAY

Look. You and I can stand here in a

culture clash til the sun comes up,

talking about what's right and what's

wrong. You're from the reservation.

It's a different world.

MAGGIE

I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street.

I did four years at Dartmouth before

I ever set foot on this res. So I

know about the other world, Ray.

MAGGIE

Are you gonna keep that medicine

bundle or are you gonna respect its

power?

MAGGIE

Thank you.

RAY

When you see Jimmy, tell him the

sooner he turns himself back into a

human being and gives himself in...

the sooner we back off this

reservation. Okay?

MAGGIE

Grandpa Reaches says you come from

heavy Indian blood. I used to think

Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I

know he is.

RAY

Move it, Magdelana.

COOCH

Ray, you alright?

AGENT SHERMAN

What do we got, Ray?

RAY

It was just Eagle Bear. I questioned

and released her.

COOCH

What'd she say?

RAY

She talks a lot of shit. We're not

doing our job. Jimmy's innocent.

"What's the FBI really doing here."

Some shit about the Fort Laramie

Treaty.

RAY

She took something from the house.

What she called a medicine bundle.

Most likely Jimmy's.

COOCH

Let's see it.

RAY

I gave it back to her.

AGENT SHERMAN

Why?

RAY

If it is Jimmy's, she's taking it to

him. We'll have a runner. But I

borrowed a little mojo...

COOCH

Way to go, Raymond. Miles, take that

to lab. Sherman, I want you to go

back to base and produce some written

material. Something that indicates

that our girl Maggie is leaking

information to us. And make sure

that material finds its way into the

hands of the Warrior Movement.

COOCH

You gentlemen missed that medicine

basket. Go back through the house,

and make sure you missed nothing

else. And lay some wire, too. Let's

do it.

COOCH

That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let

the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.

RAY

Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an

informant?

COOCH

Her own people start to suspect her,

it creates discord from within. The

Warriors don't know who to trust,

they start infighting, and Jimmy

loses his support.

COOCH

Her oil pan is shot.

RAY

Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?

COOCH

Jesus, I don't know. You tell me.

You're the Indian.

COOCH

Get a tail on her, Ray.

RAY

Cooch.

(a quiet, tired laugh)

Where the fuck did they send us?

COOCH

A long way from home. You be careful

out there.

RAY

For all I know, you're Jimmy. And

you're just waiting for a shot at my

jugular. Drink, Jimmy. Milk is good

for you --

CROW HORSE

Don't be mad. That was just an old

traditional gesture that means hello,

how are you.

RAY

I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.

RAY

Have a nice day.

CROW HORSE

Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked

it out. You can stop taggin' my

sister.

RAY

She's your sister?

RAY AND CROW HORSE

Spiritual sister.

RAY

Gotchya. We just nailed a genetic

match between the eagle feather left

at the murder site and one in Jimmy's

medicine bundle. It came from a white

eagle. Same bird.

CROW HORSE

So did this one. Wambli is a rare

and sacred creature. When someone

finds a dead one, the feathers get

around the res. We share everything.

A lot of power in the eagle feathers.

But you think that's bullshit too,

don't --

RAY

(ala Crow Horse)

-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the

outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a

car pulled into the yard. He came

out, approached the vehicle then saw

that the man behind the wheel was

Jimmy. He tried to get back into the

trailer, but the car came highballing

at him. He started running for the

open grass. With the car moving,

Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window,

took aim -- missed once, hitting the

shitter -- fired again, and severed

Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and

came to a stop in the grass. And

some chicken feed. Stale chicken

feed with four days mold.

(a beat)

Electromagnetic printing.

CROW HORSE

Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy

Looks Twice was nowhere near there.

Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years

old, his mother and father was killed

in a car wreck right down there near

Elk Mountain.

RAY

I don't see the connection.

CROW HORSE

The connection is, it did a head

number on him. He's petrified of

cars. Won't drive. I've known him

all my life, and he's never gotten

behind the wheel of a vehicle. He

rides passenger and he rides horses,

and that's it. The man that shot Leo

down was behind the wheel of a moving

car.

RAY

That's not solid.

CROW HORSE

You want solid? That one, single,

print he left in the Badlands -- the

one the FBI missed and then stepped

all over -- it belongs to a man who

walks heels first. Like a white man.

Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk --

ball of the foot first. The man who

murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.

RAY

You're saying a white guy did it...

CROW HORSE

When Leo was dumped out there in the

Badlands, he was dropped on his back.

Our man made an effort to turn him

over, onto his face. It's an old

Ind'n belief that if a dead man is

turned face down, his spirit won't

leave. And in the killer's case, it

won't come back and jump all over

his shit. That's an Ind'n thing a

white man wouldn't know.

CROW HORSE

And that's the way it is. Write it

down.

CROW HORSE

You laugh all you want, Breed. Sunset

tonight, I get my man.

RAY

Alright, Crow Horse. I'm listening.

I'm listening to the trees, to the

stones. Who is it?

CROW HORSE

Damned if I know.

CROW HORSE

But the Old One. He did a Yuwipi

ceremony last night.

RAY

The old man? He's gonna tell you who

killed Leo?

CROW HORSE

Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's

gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him.

I'm late.

RAY

Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses

you're wearing.

CROW HORSE

Grandpa traded with me.

(flips the bird)

Goodbye.

CROW HORSE

He says, back behind Red Deer Table,

where the Elk-People-used-to-live...

there are strange creatures from

another world who eat stones... and

who will kill anyone who crosses

into this place.

CROW HORSE

He says, in the Yuwipi ceremony last

night, he saw you... going back into

the land beyond Red Deer Table. I

was with you. But that was all the

Spirits let him see so he doesn't

know if you were killed or not. But

he thinks you probably were.

CROW HORSE

Go to the land where the Elk-People-

used-to-live and you will find the

answers you came here looking for.

But you must go as two. That is the

vision. I have spoken. And this is

so.

CROW HORSE

He wants to trade.

(a beat)

He likes your watch.

RAY

I can't do that,

(explaining)

It's a Rolex.

CROW HORSE

A what?

RAY

I'm sorry, this is --

(loud to Grandpa)

-- this is very, very expensive.

It's --

(to Crow Horse)

Tell him this is an expensive watch.

CROW HORSE

He says, you need to go on Indian

time. He says your watch is ruining

your life anyway.

CROW HORSE

Red Deer Table, Ray.

RAY

Don't tell me: heavy duty.

CROW HORSE

Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi

Spirits. It's one of those few places

we'd never go to as kids. Still don't.

Some of the old people say Crazy

Horse is buried back there. We have

to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.

RAY

Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I

say that evil spirits are killing

everybody on the reservation?

CROW HORSE

Ray --

RAY

-- no. No offense to the old man. I

appreciate you trying to help. But I

put my ass on the line coming out

here, man.

CROW HORSE

What'd you expect to hear?

RAY

Not Native American myths and legends.

I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember?

Not National Geographic.

CROW HORSE

What you call myths, we call our

history.

RAY

It's not real.

CROW HORSE

What's real to you? Wall Street?

Capital Hill? Now they are myths.

RAY

I can't be dicking around here. That's

all I'm saying. I don't carry

crystals, I don't wanna come back in

another life. I just wanna do my

job, and do it right, and get the

fuck outta here.

CROW HORSE

You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal

Mineo Indian.

GRANDPA (O.S.)

Knock it off!

GRANDPA

Will ya knock it off? You're actin'

like a couple of old women.

GRANDPA

For cryin' out loud. Knock it off.

RAY

He speaks English.

CROW HORSE

Only when he's really pissed off.

GRANDPA

Come inside. Watch TV.

CROW HORSE

Don't accuse nothin' of not bein'

real, Little Weasel. Cuz the only

thing around here that ain't real is

you.

RAY

Take care of yourself, Walter.

CROW HORSE

Likewise.

SA SHERMAN

We've gotten word that Jimmy has

been trying to hook up with Maggie

Eagle Bear... but some of the Warriors

have been sending word to Jimmy that

she may be an FBI operative. So he

doesn't know where to go.

COOCH

Bingo. It's working.

SHERMAN

He's out of room. All the reservation

exits have been watchdogged. We got

him. I give it twelve hours.

RAY

Well we better use those twelve hours

to apprehend the right man.

COOCH

The right man? Talk to me, Ray.

RAY

Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from

the driver's seat of a moving car

then drove those eight miles to the

Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never

been behind the wheel of a car. It's

a known fact out here that he's

petrified of driving. His parents

were killed in a car wreck.

SHERMAN

That's not very solid.

RAY

There was also a print found in the

Badlands that indicated diagetic

locomotion. Heels first. Jimmy's

walking pattern doesn't match. He

has a distinct Indian walk.

SA MILES

Indian walk? You been smoking hooch

in the peace pipe, Ray?

RAY

They don't smoke hooch in The Pipe,

Miles. They smoke something called

kinickinick, it's like a tobacco.

SA SHERMAN

Well, you're right about X21 being a

Washington Redskin, that's for sure.

What else, Ray?

COOCH

You boys want a soda?

SA MILES

Oh, yeah, a Coke. You buying?

COOCH

No, Ray's buying. Sherman? Coke?

SHERMAN

Oh... no. No, Cooch, I'm working on

a coffee here. Indian walk?

COOCH

Genetic ditto on evidence found at

the site with evidence you found in

his belongings. An incontrovertible

motive. And definite footprints on

Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs

house.

RAY

When did we get that?

COOCH

Today. And now you -- there's a dog

in the van --

RAY

-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get

rid of --

COOCH

You weren't sent here to go off on

your own detail, Ray. You were sent

here to assist in a Selective

Operations Unit. These regional agents

are inept -- that's why they were

sent out here to The Graveyard, to

Indian Country. I need you behind

me, Ray. Not pulling against me.

RAY

I'm not trying to pull against you,

Cooch. I've just been having

nightmares about the way Leo was

killed.

COOCH

Your first homicide, that's gonna

happen, Ray...

RAY

I just wanna make sure no one else

gets done in that way because we

were in bed with the wrong doer.

COOCH

Ray. I never get into bed with

somebody unless I know for sure.

Just the way I was raised.

RAY

Alright. Alright...

COOCH

(lightly)

Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you --

give a yuppie a badge and he wants

to take over the world. Go get a

tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with

her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I

want you to make the collar.

COOCH

Ray.

COOCH

I'll sleep around a little.

RAY

Thanks, Cooch.

COOCH

And get rid of the dog.

RAY

(whispering)

Motherfucker.

COOCH

Bastards...

RAY

All I could think of was... not here.

I don't wanna eat it on an Indian

Reservation, three thousand miles

from home.

COOCH

He's out there. He's out there playing

Sitting Bull with us. I want the

motherfucker so bad I'm getting a

bleeding ulcer.

RAY

It may have been Maggie's way of

saying "get off my ass."

COOCH

She's that subtle?

RAY

Eagle's claws and a bear's balls

that's what her profile says.

COOCH

Well, she's running now, too. These

fucking people like to run, don't --

RAY

-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.

COOCH

Tread matches. It's the car.

RAY

Yes.

COOCH

But this doesn't make any sense,

Ray. If it's just been sitting in

this dry wash for seven days... why

the hell didn't we find it?

RAY

Because this isn't a dry wash.

RAY

It's the Little Walking River.

RAY

And it was full of water when I drove

by here three days ago. Full. I

mean... a river.

COOCH

The Little Walking River. You're

right. This is part of it. So whoever

sunk this car didn't compensate for

drought. Goddamn.

RAY

Listen to the water...

CROW HORSE

Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of

your Imagination.

RAY

Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What

are you doing?

CROW HORSE

You're right about the old man. His

power's long dried up. He's supposed

to be a medicine man but he won't go

see the people. He says we changed,

and we don't listen. Well, he don't

go out and talk no more. I haven't

had a drink in three years but I

just turned my sobriety chip into

that man behind the bar, and this

Hoss is gettin' watered.

RAY

Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in

here, Man.

CROW HORSE

Cuz I'm a skin?

RAY

Cuz you're a cop.

CROW HORSE

Not no more.

RAY

What are you talking about?

CROW HORSE

You tell me. You tell me who went to

the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian

Annihilation and said I was messin'

with your case, man. I don't give a

goddamn about your case.

RAY

And I don't give a goddamn about

whether you wear a badge or not,

Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.

CROW HORSE

Still after Jimmy?

RAY

They found prints at Blue Legs' place.

CROW HORSE

Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But

they cross over Benjamin Black Star's

prints. And he wasn't there until

six o'clock the mornin' after to get

eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy

wasn't there til the next day. Follow?

CROW HORSE

Look, man... you better bust Jimmy

and get out before somebody shoots

up more than your car next time.

RAY

Next time I'll be ready. You get the

word to who ever it is.

CROW HORSE

I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.

CROW HORSE

You think you was sent here cuz you're

a good cop?

RAY

No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian.

And a good cop.

CROW HORSE

You ever think that maybe you was

sent here cuz the FBI's need one

good reason to take out the entire

Warrior Movement. And what better

reason than one of their men, gettin'

blown away on the res. A low-rent,

expendable public servant sent in to

take a bullet for his country.

RAY

I'm sick of your shit --

RANCHER (O.S.)

I'm sick of the two of ya timber

niggers spewin' off.

CROW HORSE

Sorry, we don't speak United States.

RANCHER'S SON

Yeah, well I do. Get the Jesus up,

and get the Jesus out or I'm gonna

go out to my truck and come back

with my hardware.

RAY

Woh, hold on there, Jack, you're --

RANCHER'S SON

-- don't "jack" me, Squanto. I'll

bury your lazy ass right here.

RANCHER'S SON

I'm talkin' to --

BROOKS

No! No, you butt holes! He ain't

skin! He AIN'T SKIN!

CROW HORSE

Yeah he's In'dn. Miniconjou Sioux.

RANCHER'S SON

You ain't Indian?

OLDER RANCHER

What's so damn funny?

CROW HORSE

Well, it's just that the cavalry

used to always threaten the Lakota.

The cavalry ain't around anymore.

The Lakota still are.

RANCHER'S SON

I got no trouble tellin' where you

come from, Fat Red.

BAR MAN

Sorry. On the house.

RAY

No plates. No registration. Serial

numbers removed. And all prints washed

off by the river. That's great. This

is turning out to be a walk in the

park, do you know that?

RADIO

(woman agent)

Come back?

RAY

Never mind.

RADIO

Ray. X22.

RAY

I read, Cooch.

RADIO

Remember that upside down flag back

at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it

down.

RAY

Good.

RADIO

They took it down, set fire to it,

and threw it on the doorstep of room

13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your

room.

RADIO

We traced the number of the truck

that dumped it, and it belongs to

one Maggie Sanders, also known as

Maggie Eagle Bear. She's been all

over the res, riling up the

traditionals, telling them not to

break, and to keep Jimmy in hiding.

She's a problem now. And she's yours.

Get her off the reservation.

LITTLE GIRL

Are they all right under here?

MAGGIE

Two-hundred and sixty-seven men,

women, old people. And little ones

like you. Many killed running along

that road you see there.

LITTLE BOY

Where were they runnin' to?

MAGGIE

A place called The Stronghold.

(a beat)

They died for a dream. But you live.

You are their great-great

grandchildren and you live. We have

to honor their dream. Of protecting

the Mother Earth. And being proud of

being Indian.

LITTLE BOY

My mother told me that they call us

Indians cuz Columbus was lookin' for

India when he discovered our country.

MAGGIE

Yeah, well, let me tell you something,

Henry: just be glad he wasn't looking

for Turkey.

MAGGIE

Richard. Sing the Honoring Song with

them. I'll be right back.

MAGGIE

We're praying at the grave. Do you

wanna join us?

RAY

No, Maggie. But you're gonna have to

join me for a ride. I'm taking you

to Rapid City.

MAGGIE

So much power. I see it in your eyes.

This... hunger for power. Or for

what you think is power.

RAY

You burned an American flag today.

And left it for me...

MAGGIE

-- You desecrated it, it had to be

burned.

RAY

I desecrated it?

MAGGIE

You forced an innocent man to run

like an animal. You've tried to poison

my people's hearts against me with

your manipulation, with letters I

never wrote... you've been watching

me eat, work, raise my family...

wash myself in the river. And now

you're here, arresting me at a sacred

place.

(a beat)

In your eyes, that's power.

MAGGIE

So I plant this tree for you. And I

take all this stuff that you've laid

on me and my people, and I put it in

this hole with this pine cone.

(she covers it)

And I bury it. Cuz ya know what it

is, Ray? Bullshit. And shit is

fertilizer.

(she stands)

And The Mother will turn your lies

into something that lives.

MAGGIE

That's what power is, in the Indian

way.

(holds her hands out

to be cuffed)

Take me to Rapid, Ray. I'm the enemy.

RAY

If I told you... that I think Jimmy's

innocent... but I'm in over my head...

would you believe me?

MAGGIE

See those Black Hills out there,

Ray? When the people lost the land

in 1868, the government took

everything but those hills. They

allowed us to keep those Black Hills,

to live there. Signed a treaty. Until

they found gold. Then they told us

we had to leave because of National

interest. They broke that treaty.

Anyone who fought or spoke out against

it, wound up dead or in jail. And

the people wound up here. On a

reservation.

MAGGIE

While up there, in the Black Hills...

they carved the faces of four

presidents.

MAGGIE

Your relatives must've taught you

something.

RAY

NO.

(after thought)

My father never told anybody he had

Indian blood. But he still used a

few Indian words around the house.

He called me Washee. Said it meant...

good boy.

RAY

What?

MAGGIE

Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like

tallow we put in stew. I think he

was calling you chubby boy.

RAY

Great.

RAY

You ever see that car before?

RAY

Who's it belong to?

RAY

Help me, Maggie...

RAY

I didn't see you today, Maggie.

(a beat)

Goodbye.

MAGGIE

Goodbye... Wa-shee.

RAY

Anyone who fought or spoke out against

it... wound up dead or in jail.

RAY

(to himself, flustered)

That was 1868, Maggie...

COOCH

Jesus, you alright?

RAY

Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't

believe it. I --

COOCH

Never turn your radio off! I thought

I was gonna find you scalped! Damn

it!

RAY

Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --

COOCH

-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got

Jimmy nailed. Let's go!

COOCH

HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!

SHERMAN

Where is he, Sam? Where's Jimmy?

SHERMAN

He's a medicine man, Ray. The

"spiritual leader" of the Warriors.

That right, Sam?

COOCH

Trailer's clean, let's go.

SHERMAN

You been the one making it rain like

that, out there, Sam?

RAY

Hey, put that down.

SHERMAN

Can you make Jimmy outrun an M-16,

Sam?

RAY

Sherman!

MILES

EASY, MEN! HEY! --

RADIO

HE'S ON THE ROOF! HE'S ON THE FUCKING

ROOF! COME ON GUYS, COME ON, GUYS!

LOOKS TWICE

Brother, the old man told me about

you. Listen to me: what was Leo trying

to tell me? He wanted to meet me at

Maisy --

FED

Save your speeches for prison, Jimmy.

COOCH

Damn. That's one hard running Indian.

COOCH

It's over, Ray. I aged five years.

But it's over. At least I'm gonna

look like I'm ready for the advisory

desk. Let's go get a beer.

RAY

Look... I'm not who you think I am.

(a long beat)

I'm sorry.

GRANDPA

Out back that way... is a placed

called Wounded Knee.

GRANDPA

I was one years old there when our

people were shot down. My mother hid

me in the snow in a blanket. One of

those killed was a Holy Man called

Wakiyan Cante -- Thunder Heart. They

killed him while he was running for

The Stronghold. It is his blood --

the same blood that spilled on the

grass and snow at Wounded Knee --

that runs through your heart like a

buffalo.

GRANDPA

Thunder Heart has come. Sent here to

a troubled place to help his people.

That's what I am told. Maybe you're

right and I am mistaken. Your mind

is young, mine is old. If so, so be

it. Ho Hecetu Yelo. I'll speak no

more.

COOCH

Buffalo burgers and cold beer,

Raymond. Don't worry about the sign

out front... you don't have to be

Indian anymore.

COOCH

You have a fever. You okay?

COOCH

Listen: when we get back tomorrow,

you're gonna find Tully laying a

promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to

prove that his yuppie agents are

making good. He's offering you New

York. Tell him you want Atlanta.

RAY

Why?

COOCH

Cuz I want New York.

RAY

Cooch. They sent us out here because

the place was being neglected. Now,

all of a sudden, there's two five

man SWAT teams out there tonight.

Bell Huey choppers flying all over

the place. Federal occupation to

catch one guy. Why, Cooch? What's

going on?

COOCH

National security, Ray. Get some

sleep. Tomorrow, we fly.

RAY

I'm looking for Richard Yellow Bird.

YELLOW BIRD

The Washington Redskin. Thought you'd

be gone by now.

YELLOW BIRD

What ya want?

RAY

Must be a bitch getting around in

that wheelchair. How long you been

in it?

YELLOW BIRD

Since I got a iron pipe put across

my knees, man. Fight with three

wasi'cus, ya know.

RAY

At Sioux Falls Pen?

YELLOW BIRD

No, that was Leavenworth. This --

(shows a scar)

was Sioux Falls. What ya want?

RAY

Leavenworth a tough joint?

YELLOW BIRD

You ever try solitary confinement?

RAY

No. Can't say that I have, Richard.

Richard do you know why I'm here?

YELLOW BIRD

Washington sent ya. I know that.

RAY

Yes, Washington sent me, Richard.

They sent me here because this whole

thing has been fucked. Do you know

what I mean when I say this whole

thing has been fucked, Richard?

RAY

An arrangement was made between you...

and us. Do you remember that

arrangement?

YELLOW BIRD

I'm here, ain't I?

RAY

Not for long, Richard. You got early

parole under the stipulation that

you would help us in a situation,

and you didn't deliver.

YELLOW BIRD

What the fuck you talkin' about?

RAY

Get up out of the chair, Richard.

YELLOW BIRD

What's with you people? Why do ya

have to fuck with my head all the

time? I came through, man.

RAY

Get up out of the chair, and walk

toward the backdoor, Richard.

YELLOW BIRD

(not moving)

I get thrown in solitary until I

don't know my own fuckin' name, and

then you people tell me I can beat

nine years if I help you. I helped

you!

RAY

Get up!

YELLOW BIRD

They said I'd never see FBI again,

and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I

don't feed ya information on the

Warriors, it's back to the pen. I

don't do this, back to the pen. Your

word against my word. Against a con

Indian's word. I really got a chance,

man, right?

RAY

They sent me here, Richard because

they said you didn't hold up your

end of the arrangement, and I have

to transport you back to Leavenworth.

YELLOW BIRD

(crying)

What the fuck, man? What do you people

want? I did what you wasi'cu's told

me to do.

RAY

Leo Fast Elk... is alive.

YELLOW BIRD

No way. No fuckin' way.

RAY

How the hell do you know?

YELLOW BIRD

I blew his back out with a buffalo

gun, that's how I know! Now you're

gonna say I didn't, so you can throw

me back in solitary?

RAY

The men who came to see you at

Leavenworth. The one's who made the

arrangement... who were they? Maybe

I can talk to them.

YELLOW BIRD

Miles. Three other suits. That's all

I know 'em as -- suits. Were you

there?

RAY

You turned Leo over on his face. But

the coyotes must've turned him back

over, man, cuz his spirit is out.

It's out, and it knows.

YELLOW BIRD

What do you know about spirits? You

ain't no In'dn.

RAY

Leo knew something heavy and was

trying to tell Jimmy. But you must

not know how serious it was or you

would have delivered. Do you realize

what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do

you?!

YELLOW BIRD

I took him out before he got the

chance. He didn't say nothin' about

Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in

the dirt. Forever.

RAY

What's Tashka Sha, speak English,

speak English!

YELLOW BIRD

Red Deer Table! What's with you,

man?

YELLOW BIRD

Wait a minute. Wait -- what are you

doin'? You ain't a FBI. You ain't

the law. Let me see your --

RAY

I'm the fucking law!

RAY

Keep talking, Yellow Bird...

YELLOW BIRD

All I know... is I did what I did...

and I ain't in solitary, gettin'

pumped up with downer, gettin' beat

to shit. But I tell you what, Suit.

Take me back. Cuz I can't take this

shit no more.

YELLOW BIRD

Man, I don't know who the fuck I am

no more.

RAY

You and me both.

RAY

Maggie!

CROW HORSE

Five-hundred year old turtleshell

rattle...

RAY

Crow Horse, listen --

CROW HORSE

Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.

RAY

Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.

CROW HORSE

You got Jimmy. Let her go.

RAY

Crow Horse, listen. You have to come

with me.

CROW HORSE

Why? So you can get rid of me, too?

RAY

No. So we can do what the old man

said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We

have to go.

CROW HORSE

Maybe the old man's visions are still

strong.

RAY

Do they come in dreams, these visions?

CROW HORSE

Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin'

sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge.

Ya never know when.

RAY

Just before we caught Jimmy... I had

a dream that I was being chased. And

I was running with other people. Old-

fashion Indian people. I got shot in

the back. Like Leo.

CROW HORSE

Where was this?

RAY

At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where

I was, and that's where the dream

was. Why?

CROW HORSE

You were running with the old ones.

At The Knee. Heavy duty.

RAY

Well, it was just a dream, I --

CROW HORSE

Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man?

Who are you?

RAY

What do you mean?

CROW HORSE

Nothin'. Forget it.

CROW HORSE

You had a vision. You had yourself a

vision. A man waits a long time for

a vision. Might go his whole lifetime

and never get one. And along comes

some instant Indian with a Mastercard

and brand-new shoes, has himself a

vision.

RAY

Sorry.

CROW HORSE

I'm a full-blood Oglala.

RAY

We've driven a long way. Where is

this place?

CROW HORSE

Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know,

just one of them, what do ya call

'em, fitful dreams?

RAY

Yeah. Fitful dreams.

CROW HORSE

Bullshit. You had a vision. You got

sign from the old ones.

RAY

What the hell do you want me to do?!

CROW HORSE

Stop.

RAY

What's that?

CROW HORSE

Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.

RAY

Jesus. Oil?

CROW HORSE

Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came

in from the Nebraska side, and did

some shotgun testin'. They're gettin'

ready to suck this baby dry.

RAY

1868...

CROW HORSE

What?

RAY

That's what we're doing here. National

interest. National security. Only

this time it's not gold. It's uranium.

CROW HORSE

We're standin' on broken treaty

ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to

be here. It'll poison the water.

RAY

Leo knew about it. Tried to tell

Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.

CROW HORSE

So they took care of Leo.

RAY

Listen to the water... the river

keeps goin' down then rising again.

CROW HORSE

They're drainin' our water table.

That's our life, man...

RAY

No. No...

RAY

This Clear Moon's house?

CROW HORSE

Yeah. It's time to beat the drum.

You better wait here. He don't trust

the white man.

CROW HORSE

Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's

callin' council fire. All the old

chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta

be at Grandpa's place in two hours.

We need to get the tribe together.

We need to block this thing.

RAY

What we need... is Richard Yellow

Bird.

CROW HORSE

I thought it was a rare case of a

brother getting a break in the courts.

We did an honorin' song for him and

everything.

RAY

He's looking at a few hundred years

in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come

out without a fight.

RADIO

X21. Read. X21...

RAY

X21. Come back.

RADIO

Ray. What's your 20?

RAY

Reservation.

RADIO

What are you doing on the reservation?

RAY

I'm on my way back in. Over.

CROW HORSE

Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man.

Ray...

RAY

You go to the council fire. I'm going

back in.

CROW HORSE

Ray.

CROW HORSE

Ray!

COOCH

(extra casual)

Couldn't sleep, Ray?

RAY

No...

RAY

I had to finish something with Crow

Horse.

COOCH

That's where you were. You had to go

back and have it out with the Indian

law...

COOCH

You fucking hot head, we can get in

trouble for that.

RAY

Why didn't you tell me what we were

doing here?

RAY

We're running a cover-up and you

didn't --

COOCH

You ever put your hands on me again

and you'll be doing the books for a

baitshop in the fucking Everglades,

Mister.

RAY

You didn't tell me about Red Deer

Table --

COOCH

-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?

RAY

What is it? It's genocide, that's

what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some

U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for

the people here. Uranium, Cooch.

COOCH

Jesus Christ. What are you doing?

What the hell were you doing out

there?

COOCH

This was a Selective Operations Unit,

Agent Levoi. There is classified

information pertaining to our national

security. You don't question that,

you don't go digging into that shit --

that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --

RAY

-- if they mine uranium there, these

people will have no place left to

go...

COOCH

We were sworn in on the Constitution

to protect federal matters, Ray. I

don't know about uranium, I don't

know about Red Dog Table -- all I

know is we did our job. It's over.

RAY

We neutralized anybody with a voice.

Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who

was standing in the way of the land.

Is that it?

COOCH

No. We neutralized enemies of the

United States. Anti-American radicals

who have killed federal officers out

here!

COOCH

Jesus, Ray. You think I don't like

the Indians? Not true. These were

noble people but their day is gone.

They're a conquered nation. They

want all of America back but they

can't even keep the garbage out of

their own front yards. It's sad,

Ray. But it's just the way it is. We

have to function as a colonial police

force out here.

MILES

You gentlemen ready -- hi, Ray.

COOCH

Yeah, we're ready.

CLEAR MOON

Ah, there you are. The Sioux.

CLEAR MOON

You got the troublemakers off our

land. Good, Was-te.

COOCH

RAY!

COOCH

No, damn it. You call teams in and

this is gonna be a fucking media

event. Get me three cars, six agents,

block all reservation exits. It's

under control.

RAY

Crow Horse!

RAY

Crow Horse!

CROW HORSE

Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear

Moon...

RAY

I know. Come on. We gotta get off

the reservation or we're dead.

CROW HORSE

Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.

RAY

Bullshit, let's get outta here,

CROW HORSE

Grandpa...

RADIO

X21, please read. Ray. Ray. X21,

please read. This is Cooch. Please

come in, Ray. Where are you?

RAY

He's gone.

CROW HORSE

He hasn't left this place in twenty

years. They got him.

COOCH

(into radio)

X21. Ray. Ray, please come in.

MILES

We have a renegade agent, Cooch? He

gets off the reservation...

COOCH

-- he's not getting off the

reservation.

CROW HORSE

They got us sealed. What are we gonna

do?

RAY

We're going for The Stronghold.

RADIO

(Cooch)

Ray. Can you hear me? You are fucked.

There's no way out of this. If you

won't listen to your own laws, then

listen to this:

(static: a new voice)

This is President Clear Moon. This

nation does not want your sympathy.

You cannot use this reservation as a

sanctuary. Stop where you are now.

RADIO

(Cooch)

Whatever you are trying to do is

futile, Raymond. You have nothing.

Nothing.

RAY

Yellow bird... is gonna sing.

RADIO

(Cooch)

Yellow Bird committed suicide at

three o'clock this morning. Some

gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him

into a corner. You're playing a losing

game. Pull over.

RECORDER

(Ray)

How the hell do you know?

(Yellow Bird)

I blew his back out with a buffalo

gun, that's how I know. And now you're

gonna say I didn't and put me back

in solitary?!

RADIO

(Yellow Bird)

You people tol' me I could beat nine

years if I helped you. I helped you!

(rewinding)

I could beat nine years if I helped

you. I helped you!

RAY

(into mic)

Fuck you.

RAY

Walter.

CROW HORSE

That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in

there, we got a chance.

RAY

We're in there. We're in there --

COOCH

(via bullhorn)

FREEZE! NOW!

COOCH

DROP IT.

COOCH

Crow Horse, get your face in the

dirt. Ray... come forward. Let it

go. Let's just let it go...

COOCH (O.S.)

Come on, Ray. Come forward.

RAY

No way, Cooch.

COOCH

Ray. I'm coming to talk to you. I'm

gonna walk you out of here. And we're

gonna get the hell outta this place.

RAY

You're right, Cooch. It's over.

CHASING HAWK

All the exits are blocked. There's

two more fed cars tryin' to get in.

And some press.

COOCH

Ray...

RAY

Let the press through.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

CROW HORSE

The people are already talkin' about

their vote for a new tribal prez.

They wanna vote for Jimmy.

RAY

What about the water...

CROW HORSE

You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't

never gonna be over... but you bought

her some time.

RAY

Some Indian time?

CROW HORSE

Indian time.

CROW HORSE

(concerned)

Where ya gonna go, Ray?

RAY

I'll have to see what the visions

say about that one.

CROW HORSE

You didn't have another vision...

CROW HORSE

Yeah, right here.

RAY

You take care.

CROW HORSE

If you ever need a place to come

back to and listen to the trees a

little... we'll be here.

CROW HORSE

Ain't no word in Sioux for goodbye.

CUT TO:

CROW HORSE (V.O.)

(voice lingering)

We will be here.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

THE END
