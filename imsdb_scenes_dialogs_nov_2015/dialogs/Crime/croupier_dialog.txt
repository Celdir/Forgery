CROUPIER

A screenplay by

Paul Mayersberg

Shooting Script

JACK'S VOICE

Now he had become the still centre

of that spinning wheel of

misfortune.

JACK'S VOICE

The world turned round him...

leaving him miraculously untouched

The little white ball circles the

spinning wheel.

JACK'S VOICE

The croupier had reached his goal.

He no longer heard the sound of

the ball.

JACK'S VOICE

To begin with he was Jack Manfred...

GILES

Take a pew, Jack. You look well.

What's it been, two years since we

broke bread?

JACK

Three years, two months. March

'93.

GILES

What a memory you've got. Maths

always was your strong suit. What

happened to the moaning Lisa?

JACK

She went back to South Africa.

GILES

(digging)

Did she?

(smiles)

You were pretty thick at one time.

JACK

We all played the field.

GILES

Hi-ya... I'll call you back.

(to Jack)

Now then...

JACK

(suddenly)

I want a job, Giles.

GILES

(cautiously)

All right. As what?

JACK

I was thinking perhaps I could be

a reader. You employ readers, don't

you?

GILES

We do. For unsolicited manuscripts.

We pay twenty pounds a manuscript.

You might get two, maybe three in

a week. Can you live on sixty

pounds?

GILES

Sorry. This is a no-smoking office,

Jack. You've written a book, haven't

you? I didn't read it myself, but --

GILES

Give me ten minutes, Fiona.

GILES

Fiona used to read for me.

GILES

Let me tell you about our operation.

We like personality authors. People

the public recognises. Celebrity's

what sells books. We can always

find someone to do the writing.

First, we need the face. Then the

concept.

(he is reading the

fax)

Right now I'm looking for a soccer

novel. Something where a tycoon

buys a lousy team and takes it to

the top. Seven figure transfer

fees. Corruption all down the line.

Violence on and off the pitch.

Steroids. Got any concepts? It

could be a thug story. I tell you

what. Why don't you think about

it. A couple of pages.  The pitch.

Steroids. Got any concepts? It

could be a thug story. I tell you

what. Why don't you think about

it. A couple of pages.

(smiles)

With plenty of sex, of course.

JACK

Interesting, Giles. I will think

about it.

GILES

Let me give you three words of

advice, Jack. Don't give up. Stick

with it. Who persists wins. That's

my motto. Write, write, write.

JACK'S VOICE

Jack had three words for, Giles.

Go fuck yourself.

MAN'S VOICE

Jacko, if you're there, pick up. I

want to talk to you. It's important.

JACK

Dad, I'm here.

JACK SR.

How's it going?

JACK

Great.

JACK SR.

Found a job?

JACK

No.

JACK SR.

Well I've got something for you.

In London, I mean. I've been

chatting to some friends. Do you

know the Golden Lion casino? It's

in Bayswater, I believe... They're

looking for a dealer, a croupier.

JACK

That's not what I want to do, dad.

JACK SR.

(lighting his

cigarette)

Don't be stubborn. The pay won't

be grand, but it's regular. That's

what you need, isn't it? I know

you don't like taking my advice...

JACK

(drinks)

It's not that.

JACK SR.

I've set this up for you. Call the

Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds,

he's the Manager. I don't know him

personally, but I've spoken to his

boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give

yourself a break.

JACK

All right, I'll think about it.

I won't. Goodbye, dad.

JACK SR.

Just do it. You've got the knack,

you've got the personality, you

got that from me.

JACK SR.

You understand the punters. Think

about it, you can write during the

day and sleep knowing the bills

are paid.

JACK SR.

For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't

look a gift horse in the mouth.

Have you written that name down?

Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.

(exhales)

JACK

(exhales)

All right, dad. Yes, I'll call

him.

JACK

So how are you doing, dad?

JACK SR.

Great. I've just started a new

company. Solid financing. It's

good.

(pause)

I love you Jacko, you know that

JACK

Yes, I know that.

JACK SR.

Don't let yourself down.

JACK

I won't.  Goodbye, dad.

JACK SR.

(smiles)

Sorry to keep you. What'll you

have?

JACK'S VOICE

Jack knew something was wrong.

He'd forgotten Giles' advice. Giles

said three words.

JACK'S VOICE

JACK'S VOICE No. Jack knew it still

wasn't quite right...

DRUNK'S VOICE

I want to fuck the whole world

over.

JACK'S VOICE

Welcome back Jack... to the house

of addiction.

REYNOLDS

David Reynolds, I'm the Manager

here. Sit down, John.

JACK

Jack.

REYNOLDS

You've been recommended by the

management here. They know your

father. He has a bit of a

reputation, hasn't he?

JACK

(frowns)

Has he?

REYNOLDS

In any case, I understand you've

had some previous experience... in

South Africa.

(Jack nods)

You'll find the rules a little

different here. Before we start,

you haven't got a police record,

have you?

JACK

No.

REYNOLDS

Where did you go to school?

JACK

(surpised)

I was at Beadles.

REYNOLDS

I don't think I know that one.

Private, I suppose.

REYNOLDS

There are three types of casino in

the U.K. High volume. Small faction.

And MOTR. That's middle of the

road. Us.

JACK

Do you have a Salon Prive?

REYNOLDS

We tried. But there wasn't enough

business. The punters like company.

REYNOLDS

Let's see you handle the chips.

JACK

I have to assume the serial numbers

on the bowl and cylinder correspond.

REYNOLDS

We check every four days.

JACK

Why four? And not three or five?

REYNOLDS

(shrugs)

It's the procedure here. Now sort

the chips.

JACK

Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.

REYNOLDS

Any exceptions?

JACK

25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.

REYNOLDS

Give me 365.

REYNOLDS

Very good. Now take these colours...

REYNOLDS

I want 780, but I want 500 in

denominations of 25.

REYNOLDS

(impressed)

Very good.

JACK

You use two alternating, don't

you?

REYNOLDS

We do.

(hands him a second

ball)

JACK

(hesitates)

Where's the magnet?

REYNOLDS

They've been tested.

JACK

No more bets.

REYNOLDS

Could you stop that for a minute?

JACK

I'm sorry, sir, I've called no

more bets.

JACK

23 Red. Odd.

REYNOLDS

Haven't you forgotten something?

JACK

(thinks)

I don't think so.

REYNOLDS

Wipe your hands.

REYNOLDS

Not with your own cloth. Besides,

your pockets will be stitched.

JACK

What happens if I want to sneeze?

REYNOLDS

You won't. Not without permission.

REYNOLDS

Fine. Now let's move on.

REYNOLDS

How many aces are left?

JACK

Five.

REYNOLDS

I make it six.

JACK

Five.

REYNOLDS

What makes you so sure?

JACK

It's a rule. Always stand by your

first count. The odds are you're

right.

REYNOLDS

Good call.

JACK

You want me to check?

REYNOLDS

(irritably)

I said good call.

JACK'S VOICE

It had taken him 45 minutes, but

Jack now had Mr Reynolds's number.

The man couldn't count.

REYNOLDS

Let me just run through a few

things. As a dealer you never

gamble, not anywhere. We'll need

your picture.

JACK

What for?

REYNOLDS

For the database. It can be accessed

by every casino in the country. We

have the same system for punters.

JACK

I don't gamble.

REYNOLDS

Ever?

JACK

I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.

REYNOLDS

Next point. Friendships between

croupiers inside or outside the

casino are discouraged.

Relationships with females working

here are expressly forbidden.

JACK

We had the same rule at Sun City,

but it was impossible to check.

REYNOLDS

This isn't South Africa. We'd know,

because someone would report it.

Believe me, someone always does.

JACK

Does know? Or does report? What

would happen if I knew something

like that and didn't report it?

REYNOLDS

We'd know. There are no secrets in

this casino. You'd be punished.

JACK

How?

REYNOLDS

First offence: verbal warning.

Second offence: written warning.

That one's filed and sometimes

copied to the Gaming Board. My

discretion. Third offence: you're

sacked on the spot. You'd never

work in a casino in this country

again.  There's another rule: you're

forbidden to talk to or recognise

a punter outside the casino. If

you see someone who's gambled here,

even if it's just casually on the

street, you must ignore him. Or

her. You're not married, are you?

REYNOLDS

Girlfriend?

JACK

Yes.

REYNOLDS

She's not in the gaming business

is she?

JACK

No.

REYNOLDS

This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing

it to you now, but you'll never

see it again.

JACK

Very impressive.

REYNOLDS

We have tapes in here that go back

six months. Let me show you

something.

REYNOLDS

See that?  That was six weeks ago.

The dealer missed it. The guy up

here missed it, but I watch these

tapes after hours. Nothing gets by

me. Now the lady's in jail. It's

easier to take ten million pounds

from a bank than take one penny

from this casino.

REYNOLDS

You can start Monday week.

JACK

Fine.

REYNOLDS

That hair will have to go.

JACK

Fine.

REYNOLDS

Are you planning to make a career

in casino work?

JACK'S VOICE

And end up like you?

JACK

I just want the job.

REYNOLDS

Jack, you're not the usual type we

get here.

JACK'S VOICE

Mr Reynolds was right. It was true.

Jack was up above the world. An

artist, living in the clouds.

Looking down.

REYNOLDS

Excuse me...

REYNOLDS

I can't talk about this now... no,

I'm with somebody. They can wait!

I'll be home at the usual time...

all right, I'll call you back in

an hour...

(hangs up)

Don't ever get married, Jack. Casino

work doesn't mix with house and

garden. Any questions?

JACK

Yes. What's the salary?

JACK'S VOICE

The casino paid its staff monthly

in arrears. He would have to wait

six weeks for his first cheque. He

needed money now.

DEALER

(fake American accent)

What kind of deal you looking to?

JACK

What's the Blue Book price?

DEALER

That's not relevant. An old car

like this, it depends on the

condition.

JACK'S VOICE

The car was a gift from Jack's

father. That's to say, Jack Senior

had given it to him before the

bailiffs arrived.

DEALER

This ain't exactly what you'd call

mint.

JACK

How about fifteen hundred?

DEALER

How about five hundred.

JACK

What?!

DEALER

How about we split the diff...

Seven-fifty.

JACK

Is that your idea of arithmetic?

DEALER

I'm not a mathematician. I'm in

business.

JACK

Eight-fifty.

DEALER

Seven-fifty.

JACK'S VOICE

He suddenly wanted to be rid of

it. 'Hang on tightly, let go

lightly'. It was a saying Jack

remembered.

JACK'S VOICE

Jack imagined people reading his

book. One day he would enter their

heads, play with their imaginations,

test their feelings...

JACK'S VOICE

He would tell them you have to

make a choice in life. Be a gambler

or a croupier. And then live with

your decision come what may.

JACK'S VOICE

Marion saw life differently. She

was a romantic. And thought he was

too.

MARION

I couldn't resist them.

JACK

You mean I won't resist them.

MARION

No, no. I'm not ready for you.

There's some vodka in the freezer.

JACK

You want me drunk?

MARION

(laughs)

I won't be that long.

JACK

You really are a beautiful woman.

MARION

(pleased)

It's not just inner beauty, is it?

JACK

Turn around.

JACK

You're all I desire.

MARION

Where did you get it?

JACK

I. sold the car.

MARION

You shouldn't have done that. I

know what it meant to you.

JACK

I owe you for the rent. It's only

a car. I can get another.

MARION

Take it back. Till you sell your

book.

JACK

Come on, Marion. Let's face the

truth. Nobody's going to publish

it.

MARION

Of course they will. You just have

to be patient. I'm betting on you.

JACK

I'm not much of a bet.

MARION

You are to me.

MARION

Come into my world.

MARION

(whispering)

You're my prisoner.

JACK

I've got something to tell you.

MARION

I want to hear it.

JACK

I've got a job.

MARION

(startled)

What job?

JACK

In a casino. As a croupier. A

dealer.

MARION

How did you land that?

JACK

It came my way. 450 a week.

MARION

(sits up)

450? What did you do, just walked

in and said I want to be a croupier?

Don't you need training?

JACK

I had training. In the Republic.

MARION

You were a croupier there? You

never told me that. I thought you

just knew some gamblers.

JACK

I start Monday week.

MARION

450 a week. I've never earned that

in my life. You're an enigma, you

are. A fucking enigma.

JACK'S VOICE

Not an enigma, just a contradiction.

MARION

You sold the car. You got a job.

What's the third thing? Tell me.

JACK

There's no third thing. Don't be

superstitious.

MARION

I love you Jack, you know that.

JACK'S VOICE

And he half-loved Marion. And she

knew that too.

JACK

Are you trying to read my palm?

MARION

You've got such beautiful hands.

JACK'S VOICE

The hands of a conjuror, a woman

had told him once. Or a card sharp.

MANICURIST

What line of work are you in?

JACK

I'm an undertaker.

MANICURIST

Really?

BARBER

Do you work round here?

JACK

My office is in Shanghai.

BARBER

(surprised)

What do you do?

JACK

I'm an arms dealer.

BELLA

I'm Bella.

JACK

Jack Manfred.

BELLA

Hi, Jack.

(fits herself into

the uplift bra)

Welcome to the cesspit.

JACK

Is it that bad?

BELLA

(starts to do up

her top)

How do I look?

JACK'S VOICE

Like trouble, Bella. You look fine.

BELLA

The punters love it. Tits in

uniform.

JACK'S VOICE

The usual bunch. They didn't know

Jack, but he knew them.

JACK

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

INDIAN

Where's the other fellow? Where's

Geoff?

JACK

He doesn't work here any more.

INDIAN

Well, let's hope you know your

job.

WOMAN

Tens, please.

WOMAN 2

Perhaps this man will bring us

luck.

WOMAN

(to Jack)

What's that aftershave you're

wearing?

JACK'S VOICE

Never converse with the punters.

It slows things down. Speed is

volume, and volume is profit for

the casino. Aim at twenty spins an

hour.

JACK

Last bets, please.

MAN

You're new here. You'll get used

to Madame Claude. She comes in

once or twice a week and does that.

JACK'S VOICE

He knew the scam. Come in with

five grand cash. No questions asked.

Launder it by getting a casino

cheque when you cash in. Jack

wondered why Mr Reynolds permitted

it? After all there's was no profit

in it for the casino. Or was there?

JACK

Thank you very much, ladies and

gentlemen. I'm going to hand you

over now to my colleague. Goodnight.

MATT

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

REYNOLDS

(quietly)

Good work, Jack. You handled

yourself well.

JACK'S VOICE

Suddenly a delayed wave of elation

came over him.

REYNOLDS

Why don't you take a break, Jack.

JACK

(puzzled)

All right, Mr Reynolds.

BELLA

Good evening, Mr Tchai.

MR TCHAI

Good evening.

REYNOLDS

Enjoy yourself, Mr Tchai.

WAITRESS

(to Mr Tchai)

Your usual, sir?

WAITRESS

Thank you, sir. Enjoy your game.

JACK'S VOICE

50 for a diet Coke. Waitresses

were the true winners in the casino.

They were the only members of staff

allowed to accept tips. On a good

night they could get between 200

and 300.

REYNOLDS

Mr Tchai always likes to play at

that table, and only with Bella.

JACK

Does he win?

REYNOLDS

(smiles)

He's a good customer.

JACK'S VOICE

A good customer is a consistent

loser. Was that what Mr Reynolds

meant?

MATT

Where do you live, Jack?

JACK

Over the river.

MATT

Have you got transport?

MATT

I'm going over the river. I'll

give you a lift if you like.

JACK

Thanks.

MATT

So how do you feel, your first

night? I'll bet you're on a high.

JACK

Nice car.

MATT

She's my baby.

JACK

How long have you worked at the

casino?

MATT

Coming up to two years now.

(mysteriously)

But I was away for six months.

JACK

You've done pretty well.

MATT

(smugly)

Not bad. I have other interests,

of course.

MATT

I'm off to a little watering hole.

Why don't you join me? Relax.

JACK

No thanks, Matt. I need my eight

hours.

MATT

I'll lay you five to one you won't

sleep. In this job you have to

unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you.

I mean that.

JACK

Some other time.

MARION

What's the time?

JACK

I don't know.

MARION

How did it go?

JACK

Fine.

MARION

You're shaking. What is it?

JACK

Tension. It'll go.

MARION

Poor baby.  This'll relax you.

MARION

I loved it blond.

JACK

It's only hair. I haven't changed.

MARION

When you get home, I'm asleep.

When I leave home, you're asleep.

JACK

(dreamily)

I'll see you in my dreams.

JANI

In 20s, please...

JACK

(frowns)

Place your bets.

JANI

5...8...11.

JACK'S VOICE

Jack could see this woman was an

experienced gambler. Professionals

always place their bets through

the croupier. That way there are

no comebacks.

JACK

I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.

MAN

(in Arabic accent)

What are you talking about? It's

11, I've won. With this lady.

JACK

(carefully)

You've won with the two chips you

placed earlier, but the third chip

was a late bet.

MAN

I put them on together.

JACK

I'm afraid that's not so, sir.

MAN

Now look here, you...

REYNOLDS

Is there a problem, sir?

MAN

Yes. This croupier is accusing me

of cheating.

JACK

It was a late bet. This gentleman

has been following the lady's

numbers and...

MAN

(to Jani)

Do you think I cheated?

JANI

In my opinion... it was a late

bet.

REYNOLDS

I think we should talk about this,

sir. Away from the table.

MAN

(angrily)

No. I won. I want to be paid.

REYNOLDS

Pay the gentleman. In full.

JACK

I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept

gratuities in the UK. It's different

in South Africa.

JANI

(surprised)

You know where I'm from?

JACK

I've lived there.

JANI

(sweetly)

Well, thank you anyway.

JACK'S VOICE

Bright woman, he thought. She knew

the rule of gold. Quit when you're

ahead.

JACK

Place your bets.

JACK

(hesitantly)

Look Matt, there's something I

have to say to you. I saw you

cheating.

MATT

(violently)

What the fuck are you talking about?

JACK

That Greek guy who won at the end.

You paid him out in 25s not 20s.

MATT

(angry)

I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it

wrong.

JACK

I'm not going to report it.

MATT

What are you, a cop?

JACK

If I see you do it again, I'll

report it.

MATT

I don't get you. Even if it was

true, which it isn't, what the

fuck difference would it make to

you?

JACK

Because if a supervisor knew I'd

seen you and I hadn't reported it,

I'd lose my job as well. And I

can't afford that.

MATT

So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack,

this whole business is bent. The

casino is nothing but legal theft.

And that's OK. It's the system.

Half the punters who come in are

using stolen money, drug money,

they haven't earned it. We earn

our money.

(softens)

I'm on your side, Jack. I don't

need an enemy.

JACK

You're talking about complicity.

MATT

I don't know what that means. I'm

talking about not rocking the boat.

MATT

OK, now let's unwind.

JACK'S VOICE

Matt was an escape artist. Like

Jack's father.

MATT

Hey, Andros!

MATT

This is Jack.

JACK

Who are these guys?

MATT

Mostly people in the casino

business. A few drug dealers.

JACK

And the girls?

MATT

Just girls. What are you drinking?

JACK

Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.

MATT

Good call. Help yourself.

JACK

Does Bella come here?

MATT

That bitch? No.

MATT

Hey Jack, join us.

JACK

No thanks.

MATT

(laughs)

Don't worry, I won't report you!

JACK

I don't gamble.

GIRL

You don't gamble, but do you smoke?

JACK

Sometimes.

GIRL

(hands him the

smoking joint)

How about now?

JACK'S VOICE

Marion. I'm on my way...

JACK

I'm off. I need to sleep.

MATT

Loosen up, Jack. If you don't,

this job'll get to you. The

pressure's too much, believe me,

it'll break you.

JACK

"The world breaks everyone, and

afterwards many are strong in the

broken places." Ernest Hemingway.

MATT

Wasn't he the one who shot himself?

MARION

Where've you been? I've got to

give evidence in court at nine.

JACK

Don't play the cop with me, Marion.

MARION

Take that back!

(furious)

Fucking take that back. I'm not a

cop any more.

JACK

I take it back. You're not a cop

any more. You're a store detective.

MARION

Are you drunk?

JACK

Probably.

MARION

This fucking job's getting to you.

You haven't written a fucking word

since you started.

JACK

Do you have to swear all the time?

MARION

(hurt)

Well, that's my poor upbringing. I

didn't go to no private school. I

haven't got no class. I want to

live with a writer. Not a fucking

croupier. I don't even know what

the word means. Croupier.

JACK

Marion, stop this.

MARION

(near to tears)

What do I mean to you? I want to

know. Tell me.

JACK

You're my conscience.

MARION

Haven't you got a conscience of

your own?

MARION

What are you doing here?

(looks round

nervously)

You know the rules.

JACK

What about a drink on the way home?

MARION

I don't finish till eight. Make it

nine and you're on.

JACK

I'm on at nine.

MARION

Well, that's our life now, isn't

it?

JANI

Thinking of going back?

JACK

Oh hello.

JANI

(smiling)

You know what? I'd like to buy you

a drink.

JACK

It's against the rules. Dealers

are forbidden to talk to punters.

JANI

That's stupid. What are the odds

of you being seen with me?

JACK

Impossible to calculate.

JACK'S VOICE

Jack knew that, in reality, all

odds are calculable.

JANI

(raises her glass)

To coincidence.

JACK

(drinks)

There's a casino in this hotel.

JANI

I'm not much of a gambler really.

I just like this bar.

JACK

So why did you come to my casino?

JANI

I was at a loose end. A friend of

a friend gave me a courtesy

membership.

JACK

First visit to London?

JANI

No, no. I come every couple of

years. I always think I'm going to

stay. I'm from Cape Town originally

JACK

I was born in the Transkei, on the

Wild Coast.

JANI

Near the casino.

JACK

In the casino.

JANI

Now there's a coincidence. My father

used to gamble there.

JACK

Your father?

JANI

I loved the atmosphere. But it

destroyed my poor mother.

JACK

The debts.

JANI

And the lies. Gamblers are born

liars.

JACK

(nods)

And superstitious too. It's like

witchcraft.

JANI

That's Africa. There's an African

in all of us, isn't there?

JACK

We all came from Africa, supposedly.

JANI

Do you believe in astrology?

JACK

Absolutely not. But then, I'm a

Gemini and Geminis don't believe

in astrology.

JANI

You know, you don't strike me as a

typical croupier.

JANI

I'm not married. I wear it to keep

the flies off.

(looks at her watch)

I must go. Let me pay for this.

JACK

Absolutely not.

JANI

Toss you for it.

JACK

I don't gamble.

JANI

(low voice)

I know this is verboten, but if

you feel like a chat or maybe

dinner, give me a call.

JANI

I'll understand if you don't.

(smiles)

But I hope you do.

JACK'S VOICE

He didn't know why, but he'd started

to dress for the casino at home...

JACK'S VOICE

... like a musician in his tuxedo,

going to the concert hall on public

transport...

WOMAN

Animal!

JACK

Would you mind being more careful,

sir.

MAN

I've got 'flu.

WOMAN

Then go back home. To the zoo!

JACK

This gentleman accidentally coughed

onto these chips. I don't think it

would be hygienic to stack them...

SUPERVISOR

Agnes. These chips have to be

counted and put into the steamer.

AGNES

Yuck.

MATT

I can't give you a lift back

tonight.

JACK

Don't worry.

BELLA

(calling)

Jack. Do you need a ride?

JACK

No. Thanks.

BELLA

My car's in the garage.

JACK

Maybe another time.

BELLA

I'll take you up on that.

JACK

(pleasantly)

Goodnight.

MAN

You don't recognise me? You had me

barred. You fucking little worm.

JACK

Wait a minute. You got yourself

barred.

MAN

It was you, you shit.

JACK

Now I'm going to kill you.

BELLA

Jack!

BELLA

Jack. Leave him! Come on!

BELLA

Let's go. We don't want the cops

here.

JACK

(coldly)

He won't cheat again.

BELLA

You're shaking.

JACK

It's the tension.

BELLA

Excuse the mess.

BELLA

Careful.

BELLA

Don't tear anything.

BELLA

It's funny, isn't it? If that guy

hadn't come up to you, you wouldn't

be here now.

JACK

I hate cheats.

BELLA

All men are cheats.

BELLA

I spent two years on the game. I

don't mind telling you that.

BELLA

But don't worry, I'm clean as a

whistle. I only did S & M.

(she hands the joint

to JACK,)

No blow jobs. No screwing.

JACK

Why did you quit?

BELLA

I got scared.

JACK

(inhales)

I can imagine.

BELLA

Can you? I'm happy being a dealer.

At least the punters keep their

hands to themselves.

JACK

You called the casino a cesspit.

BELLA

Well it is. But I know where I am.

BELLA

I've been watching you work. You're

the best in the place. But you

know that.

JACK

I despise the job.

BELLA

Ah, we all say that. But if we

hate it, why do we do it?

JACK'S VOICE

Jack wanted to say we do it for

the money. But that wasn't really

true.

BELLA

What do you really want to do?

JACK

The Indian rope-trick.

BELLA

Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm

sorry. It's none of my business.

It's just that you're not like the

others.

JACK

Not like Matt, you mean.

BELLA

Now he's a real shit. Don't get

friendly with him. I'm sure he's

got his hand in the till. You know

what he said to me once? "I want

to fuck the whole world over. That's

my mission." The shit!

JACK

Ouch.

BELLA

Sorry.

JACK'S VOICE

Jack could hear Matt saying it...

JACK'S VOICE

"I want to fuck the whole world

over. It's my mission."

JACK'S VOICE

At last he had found what he'd

been looking for. A clear and simple

theme. And a hero to act it out.

Little Matt...

(Pause)

...Chapter One.

MATT

I look like shit.

JACK

Rough day?

MATT

Rough life, Jack.

PAT

Hi. I'm Pat.

JACK

(to Matt)

What happened to Bella?

MATT

I'll tell you later.

MR TCHAI

What happened to Bella?

JACK

She was re-assigned.

JACK

(formally)

Good evening.

JACK'S VOICE

Jack knew this was no coincidence.

Why had she come?

JANI

One thousand even. In fifties.

JACK'S VOICE

He wondered if she believed he

would bring her luck...

JANI

In fifties.

JACK'S VOICE

Or did she think he would help her

win?

JACK'S VOICE

He knew how to fix it for her. His

father had taught him the trick.

Switch the sequence. Bust the bank.

The casino wouldn't spot it. But

Jack was wary of the punters...

JACK'S VOICE

He could see Mr Tchai was counting.

He couldn't risk it.

JACK'S VOICE

He noticed she wasn't wearing her

ring. Why not? Odds on she'd sold

it.

JANI

Good night. Thank you.

JACK

Good night.

JACK'S VOICE

Thank you, she said. For what,

Jack thought. Jani de Villiers

knew the odds.

MR TCHAI

Pretty woman.

JACK

Hello...

JACK SR

How's it going, Jacko?

JACK

Fine. I took the job.

JACKSR

Good for you. I was wondering what

happened.

JACK

I tried to call you, dad, but they

said your line was disconnected.

JACK SR

(jovially)

Ah yes, I moved house. Needed a

bigger place. How's that book of

yours coming along?

JACK

I'm getting there.

JACK SR

It's good to have the job to fall

back on, isn't it?

(pause)

There goes my other phone.

JACK

Goodbye dad.

MARION

I don't like it.

JACK

Why not?

MARION

I don't like it at all. You had a

wonderful character before, the

Gambler. He was so romantic.

JACK

He was a loser. This guy's a

croupier. He can't lose. People

have shat on him all his life. Now

he's in control. He's a winner.

MARION

Is that your idea of a winner? He

doesn't give a shit about anyone.

He uses people and --

JACK

(interrupting)

-- It's because of the sex, isn't

it? You don't like the sex in it.

MARION

I don't give a fuck about the sex.

Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's

just a miserable zombie. Is that

the way you feel now? Is that what's

happened to you?

JACK

Marion. It's a book.

MARION

Oh really. Then why is he called

Jake. Why don't you come clean and

call him Jack.

(softens)

There's no hope in it.

JACK

It's the truth.

MARION

Without hope there's no point to

anything.

JACK

Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful

about your job? Spending the day

catching poor people stealing. You

said yourself the organised gangs

get away with it. At least in the

casino everybody gets caught. Rich

or poor, the odds are the same.

It's all relative.

MARION

Crap. It's not relative. It's

unfair. Like your casino. It's

designed unfair. And your croupier's

a little shit because he goes along

with it.

JACK

(coldly)

You're just like all those other

dummies out there. Fourteen and a

half million to one! Is that your

idea of hope?

MARION

The door, Jack.

JACK

Leave it.

MARION

No. Answer it!

BELLA

You fucking little shit! You shopped

me.

JACK

What are you talking about?

BELLA

Reynolds got a doctor in. They

forced me to take a dope test. It

was positive. As you knew.

JACK

I don't know anything about it.

BELLA

Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked

my dope, then shopped me. What do

you think of that? I can't get a

job now.

(to Jack)

You bastard. You're no different

from Matt. A pair of vicious little

shits, that's what you are.

JACK

(firmly)

Look Bella, I don't know anything

about this. You should talk to

Matt.

BELLA

You're all scumbags.

MARION

I agree.

JACK

Bella!

MARION

Go on. Go after her!

JACK'S VOICE

Jack had no idea where Marion was

staying, or with whom. He realised

he knew little about her life. But

then, he had never asked about it.

JACK'S VOICE

For the first time in a long while

Jack thought about his mother.

She'd left when she couldn't take

it any more.  His father had said

'Don't worry, Jacko, she'll come

back.' She didn't.

JACK'S VOICE

But Marion wasn't his mother...

JACK

He's paying out in stacks of 25.

REYNOLDS

I can see.

REYNOLDS

Little shit.

JACK'S VOICE

Chapter Three. His existence was

forming an interesting pattern of

betrayals. Sometimes he was unsure

whether he was the betrayer or the

betrayed.

REYNOLDS

(grudgingly)

Thanks for the information.

JACK

A pleasure. Pity about Bella.

REYNOLDS

She was a real asset. But what

could I do?

REYNOLDS

(shakes his head)

Sorry. No smoking in the Nest,

Jack.

GILES

(calling)

Jack!

GILES

I thought it was you. It's the

hair!

JACK

(touching the back

of his neck)

I'm working on that soccer story.

GILES

(vaguely)

Right.

(suddenly)

Look, I must get back to Habib.

JACK

Habib?

GILES

My author. He's a Terrorist. He's

written a kill-and-tell book.

(puts his hand on

Jack's shoulder)

Take care.

GILES

Jack, look, next weekend I'm having

a house party. Here...

(removes a card

from his pocket

book)

It's near Oxford. Why don't you

come? It'll just be social. No

business.

(conspiratorially)

Bring a friend. I've plenty of

room.

JACK

(looks at the card)

I'll try and make it.

GILES

Looking forward!

JACK'S VOICE

Books piled like chips. Stack 'em

high. Sell 'em fast. Make a killing.

You think you're a gambler, Giles,

but you're not. You're a dealer.

JACK'S VOICE

Chapter Four...

JACK

I don't know how you can drive at

night with those glasses.

JACK

How did you hurt your hand?

JANI

Just an accident. Nothing.

JACK

Turn left ahead.

JACK

Jani, there's something I want to

say. Before we get there. I don't

know what the sleeping arrangements

are. Giles probably expects us to

share a room.

JANI

That's fine.

JANI

There's no point pretending it was

an accident. I had a fight with

someone, that's all.

GILES

She's a dab hand With a racquet,

your friend.

JACK

South African women are very sporty.

GILES

I can see. How did she get that

shiner?

JACK

I found her in bed with someone.

GILES

(surprised)

Who was he?

JACK

She.

GIEES

I say. You're a dark horse, Jack.

GORDON

(to Jack)

You don't play tennis?

JACK

I don't play anything.

GORDON

How boring for you.

FIONA

Where's our drinks?

CHLOE

They're so bloody selfish.

JANI

(to Jack)

I'm so glad you brought me.

JACK'S VOICE

Jack wouldn't have come without

her.

JACK

I don't gamble.

GILES

Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a

few quid.

JACK

It's nothing to do with money. I

don't gamble.

JANI

He doesn't gamble.

JACK

I'll watch.

GORDON

(insinuatingly)

Jack likes to watch.

(to Jani)

Does he like to watch?

JANI

(to Gordon)

One more remark like that and I'll

break your balls.

GILES

(laughs)

I'll bet she could, too.

JACK

I'll deal, but I won't play.

GORDON

You sure you know how?

FIONA

Do that again.

CHLOE

That's sexy.

FIONA

Don't they look pretty.

GILES

(frowns)

There's nothing pretty about this

hand.

CHLOE

You're not supposed to talk, Giles.

FIONA

He's probably lying. He does that.

JACK

Last hand.

GILES

Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't

we...

FIONA

(sharply)

No! No stripping.

CHLOE

Right. We're not having that again!

(glances at Jack)

Although...

GORDON

I'll stick to bluffing. That's

what I'm best at.

GORDON

I'll stick.

FIONA

Two cards.

GILES

One card.

CHLOE

Oh I don't know...Er...two cards.

JANI

Three cards.

FIONA

That's it. I haven't got any more

cash.

GORDON

Beat that.

CHLOE

Ha. Ha. Ha.

GORDON

Shit.

FIONA

Not so fast, darling.

GORDON

(disbelieving)

Hang on, chaps. That's impossible!

GILES

How's about that for impossible.

GORDON

What's going on?

CHLOE

Wow. What are the odds for this

happening?

FIONA

Thousands to one.

JACK

42,300,000 to 1.

JANI

Approximately.

GORDON

I could've won if I'd been able to

bluff.

GILES

I get it.

JACK

Get what?

(smiles)

Are you accusing me of cheating?

GILES

Good God, no. But with skill like

that, what do you want a job for?

You don't need to work.

JACK'S VOICE

Here was an interesting question.

Was writing work... or play?

JANI

What happened?

JACK

Remember the guy who cheated at

the table?

JANI

You don't like cheats, do you.

JANI

Which side do you like?

JACK

(calling)

You choose.

JANI

That trick tonight, I don't think

I've ever seen that before.

JACK

It can only work with amateurs, A

pro would have spotted it.

JANI

I didn't.

JACK

Then you're not a pro.

JANI

Goodnight.

JANI'S VOICE

Jack...? I need your help...

JANI

I'm in trouble.

JACK

What kind of trouble?

JANI

I owe a lot of money.

JACK

Was that why you did the two grand?

I couldn't help you.

JANI

I know that. But you can now.

JACK

I don't have any money.  switches

on the light. JANI is looking

distressed.

JANI

Some people I know, they're planning

to rob The Golden Lion.

JACK

You don't mean that.

JANI

They mean it.

JACK

Who's they?

JANI

My creditors. One night, around

three in the morning, they'll come

into the casino -

JACK

(interrupting)

Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.

JANI

The point is, they want a man

inside.

JACK

(laughs)

And I thought you were a bright

woman.

JANI

Just listen. You don't have to do

anything criminal.

JACK

(smiles)

Robbery's not criminal?

JANI

You don't have to be criminal. A

man will come up to your table and

deliberately cheat. You'll see

him, stop him, and the guy will

make a big scene. There'll be chaos.

And that's when it'll happen.

JACK

You're serious.

JANI

You won't be committing a crime.

The man will cheat, you'll just be

doing your job, that's all.

JACK

And I thought you were only after

my body.

JANI

I've come to know you. You're

honest.

(takes his hand)

I trust you.

JACK

What'll you do when it all goes

wrong?

JANI

It won't.

JACK

But if it does.

JANI

You keep the ten thousand pounds.

JACK

What ten thousand pounds?

JANI

These people will pay you ten

thousand before and ten thousand

after. They want someone they can

be sure of, an honest dealer. That's

the point. Not all dealers are

honest. Mr Reynolds will never

suspect you.

JACK

Reynolds? You've done your research.

JANI

I didn't know what else to do.

You're my last chance.

JANI

Next time it'll be my neck.

JACK

What about my neck?

JANI

I want to go back to Cape Town, I

want to start again, clean.

JACK

I can't do it, Jani.

JANI

I'm asking you, as a...friend.

You'd be saving the life of a

friend.

JACK'S VOICE

Jack wondered why he was even

considering it. Ten grand. In cash.

That was why. But Jack didn't need

the money. His father would have

taken it, like a shot. But his

father was a gambler.

JACK'S VOICE

He was always broke. Jake suddenly

realised... it was Jake who was

considering it.

JANI

I want you to forget what I said.

JACK

Wait a minute...

JANI

No, forget it. The bet's off.

JACK

What about your father? Can he

help?

JACK

Why don't you just go back to South

Africa?

JACK

How much do you owe?

JANI

Let it go.

JACK

Did they tell you to sleep with

me?

JANI

I told you, all bets are off.

JANI

I'm sorry.

JACK

What for?

JANI

I have to take the car.

JACK'S VOICE

Hang on tightly... let go lightly.

GILES

Good night?

JACK

Not particularly.

GILES

And your lady?

JACK

She had to leave early. She asked

me to thank you.

GILES

A bit unexpected, wasn't it?

JACK

Not entirely.

GILES

How's that football story corning

along?

JACK

You said it was going to be social,

Giles. No business.

JACK'S VOICE

He was overcome with a sense of

urgency. He had to get it down...

Chapter Five.

JACK

It's beautiful. Thank you.

MARION

I hope it brings you luck.

JACK

It will.

JACK

That girl, she works at the casino --

MARION

-- I don't care about her. Of

course, I was angry. But not with

you. The book is yours not mine. I

was wrong, what I said about it. I

hurt you, didn't I?

JACK

You're entitled to your opinion.

MARION

It's none of my business what you

write. And your job, that's none

of my business either. I love you.

And I've done everything wrong.

JACK

I'll leave the casino soon.

(he strokes her

hair)

I promise.

MARION

You will?

JACK

Within a month. Believe me, I'm

going to quit!

MARION

Then you can dye your hair blond

again.

JACK

What?

MARION

You were talking in your sleep.

JACK

Not talking. Writing.

JANI'S VOICE

I need to see you. I've moved. I

have a new number. It's 468-3275.

Please call me.

JACK

I want to speak to Jani de

Villiers...

(waits)

Jani... it's Jack... I'll come

over now...

JACK'S VOICE

Chapter Seven... Jack had decided

to see her. The challenge was

essential.

JANI

Come in.

JANI

It's not the Ritz this time.

JANI

Is it yes?

JACK

Yes.

JANI

Thank you.

JACK

It doesn't seem fair. You're

offering me ten grand in cash but

you can't afford a decent place.

JANI

Well, life's not fair. We know

that.

JACK

It's all relative.  I need the

money too.

JANI

Do you?

JACK

Yes.

JANI

The date's not set yet. I'll call

you. One last thing: the man you're

going to catch cheating, he may

get violent. But you know how to

deal with cheats.

JACK

(looks at her face)

That bruise has cleared up nicely.

JANI

Bruise?

(touches her eye)

Oh, yes. It's better.

JACK

(touches his chest)

I've still got mine.

JACK

And your hand too.

JANI

(coolly)

I took the bandage off yesterday.

JANI

Would you like a drink?

JACK

No thank you.

JACK

I don't think we should meet again.

JANI

(nods)

It's a shame there aren't more men

in the world like you.

JACK'S VOICE

There was a part of Jani he really

liked.

JACK'S VOICE

Question: Was he gambling, taking

Jani's money? Answer: No. Because

he wasn't betting with his own

money. He was being paid in advance

for a service...

JACK'S VOICE

In reality there were two clear

elements of risk in this exchange.

One: the possibility the cash was

counterfeit. Two: the possibility

Jani or her creditors would want

the money back if the plan failed.

JACK'S VOICE

To begin with he put the odds at 2

against. 7 for. He checked a random

selection of bills at a bank. They

were all good.

JACK'S VOICE

So now his odds were decidedly

better. He put them at 8 to 1. The

fact that the notes were good gave

him one less negative. 2 minus 1.

At the same time mathematically he

had one more positive. 7 plus 1.

WOMAN

Bring me some luck.

JACK

No more bets.

JACK'S VOICE

Next stage. He had to be secure at

8 to 1 against having to give the

money back, so he wouldn't spend

it. If after one month no one had

approached him, he calculated the

odds of keeping it at 20 to 1.

After three months he figured 100

to 1 no one would turn up.

YOUNG MAN

How about a drink to celebrate?

MAN

(to Jack)

Cash me in.

JACK'S VOICE

Jake's experiment with the man

would prove the point.

JACK'S VOICE

People don't change.

JACK'S VOICE

He watched their faces as they

lost hour after hour, night after

night, relentlessly.

JACK'S VOICE

He questioned the conventional

wisdom that gamblers are self-

destructive...

JACK'S VOICE

He had come to believe that in

reality, they want to destroy

everyone else - their families and

loved ones, everyone. Fuck over

the whole world...

JACK'S VOICE

Without emotion he watched them

go. Jake stayed.

JANI'S VOICE

It's set. The day after tomorrow.

The twenty-fourth. Good luck.

MARION

Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?

JACK

(looks up)

Never. Why do you ask?

MARION

I can just imagine, being around

so much money all the time...

JACK

Gambling's not about money.

MARION

Really?

JACK

Gambling's about not facing reality.

Ignoring the odds.

MARION

I must be a fool. I never think

about the odds.

JACK'S VOICE

Chapter Twelve...

SUIT

Fifties. Ten of them.

JACK

What colour chips?

SUIT

Whatever.

JACK

(stiffens)

Sir, I can't accept that bet.

SUIT

Are you calling me a cheat?

PUNTER

You are a cheat. I saw you.

SUIT

(grabbing Jack's

lapel)

I'm talking to you.

REYNOLDS

Ladies and gentlemen, please be

calm. There's no cause for alarm.

Enjoy yourselves. It's Christmas.

NURSE

There you go.

JACK

How did you know I was here?

MARION

I thought you wouldn't want to

spend Christmas Day alone in here.

JACK

Did you go to the casino?

MARION

Happy Christmas.

MARION

Now...noodles or rice?

MARION

(quietly)

I don't want a criminal for a

boyfriend.

JACK

(suddenly)

There was a message, wasn't there?

MARION

It's probably easier for you to

eat the rice.

JACK

Marion!  What did you tell the

police?

MARION

Nothing about you.

JACK

Then what?

MARION

Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or

I'll shop you. All you have to do

is keep your word. It's that simple.

MARION

Here...use a spoon.

JACK

Leave me alone, Marion.

MARION

You're already alone.

JACK'S VOICE

He had always been alone. He had

always believed it would make the

decisions easier.

JACK

All right. I don't want to lose

you. I'll quit. I swear to you.

MARION

Why did you take the money?

JACK

I hate public transport.

MARION

What?

JACK

I want to buy a car.

MARION

(laughs)

How can anyone be that naive?

REYNOLDS

How do you feel, Jack?

JACK

Bruised.

REYNOLDS

Take your time. Two weeks. Three

if you need it. We'll pay you sick

leave. I don't want to lose you.

You're a good man. Here...

JACK

What's this?

REYNOLDS

(smiles)

Happy New Year. Have a drink on

the company. You've earned it.

JACK'S VOICE

Chapter Thirteen...

JACK'S VOICE

It's all numbers, the croupier

thought. A spin of the wheel. A

turn of a card. The time of your

life. The date of your birth. The

year of your death. In the Book of

Numbers the Lord said: 'thou shalt

count thy steps'.

JACK'S VOICE

Jack thought, this is it. The famous

two in the morning knock at the

door.  It wad pay-back time.

JACK'S VOICE

But he wasn't afraid. He hadn't

spent one penny of the ten grand.

He'd covered himself. He knew the

odds.

POLICEMAN

Mr Manfred?

JACK

Yes...

JACK'S VOICE

What were the odds of being killed

by a car... on New Year's Eve?

MAN'S VOICE

She was on her way home... to you.

JACK

No. She wasn't.

JACK'S VOICE

Marion had been visiting his

mother...no, no, not his mother -

her mother.

JACK

(to Ross)

She was visiting her mother. Her

mother.

(suddenly)

Who are you?

ROSS

Detective Inspector Ross.

JACK

Who...

ROSS

Ross.

JACK

Who did it? Tell me!

ROSS

We think it's a hit-and-run. A

drunk driver, probably, But there

is a possibility of a revenge

killing.

JACK'S VOICE

(distraught)

Revenge? For what? Whose revenge?

ROSS

As you know, she was a WPC with

the Met. up until two years ago.

ROSS

She called me last week. She'd got

wind of a planned robbery at your

casino.

JACK'S VOICE

What had that got to do with her

death?

ROSS

You didn't recognise the man who

attacked you, did you?

JACK

(loudly)

Of course I recognised him!

ROSS

(surprised)

You did?

JACK

I know a cheat when I see one. The

man was a cheat.

JACK

(to Ross)

Do you gamble?

ROSS

If anything occurs to you, call

me.

ROSS

I was in love with her, you know.

JACK'S VOICE

(quoting)

'The world breaks everyone, and

afterward many are strong at the

broken places. But those that will

not break, it kills. It kills the

very good and the very gentle and

the very brave impartially. If you

are none of these, you can be sure

it will kill you too but there

will be no special hurry'.

MATT

Jacko! How're you doing?

(shakes Jack's hand

vigorously)

I heard about the raid. Pity they

didn't pull it off. I wish I'd

been there.

JACK

(quietly)

But you were there Matt.

MATT

What? You know what happened to

me, don't you? That bitch Bella

shopped me. I'd like to beat the

shit out of her.

JACK

I'd like to buy you a drink.

MATT

Cheers. Happy New Year. I really

like you, Jacko, you're so fucking

straight.

(suddenly)

Hey, you haven't changed your

clothes!

JACK'S VOICE

The music stopped, Jack was drunk...

hallucinating. He was back, as a

child, in the Wild Coast Casino.

LUCY

You've been avoiding me.

JACK

(blearily)

Have I?

LUCY

I'm Lucy.

JACK

And what do you do, Lucy?

LUCY

I'm a witch. A white witch. Why

don't we move on?

JACK

Are you going to put a spell on

me?

LUCY

I might.

JACK

Nice car. How much did you pay for

it?

LUCY

Too much. Eighteen hundred.

LUCY

Where to?

JACK

Turn left at the lights.

LUCY

Hey! I saw her!

LUCY

You don't trust women drivers, do

you?

JACK'S VOICE

Jack didn't trust anyone. Except

himself.

JACK'S VOICE

It was finally finished. He thought

of sending it to Giles. But that

wouldn't be right. He would select

a publisher at random, like a

number.

PUNTER

(to Jack)

You're wasting yourself. With your

luck you ought to come over to our

side.

JACK'S VOICE

Even his publisher had no idea who

the author was. He had done the

deal through a lawyer. It gave him

a good feeling, no one knowing...

JACK'S VOICE

...It never occurred to anyone at

the Casino that the Golden Lion

had been his model. Why should it?

Weren't all casinos the same....

JACK'S VOICE

...It gave him an exquisite

pleasure, being an underground

man. With all his money, he hadn't

even bought a car. Jack knew the

truth about himself, he was a one-

book writer. A one time winner who

had quit while he was ahead...

JACK'S VOICE

He changed nothing in the flat,

bought nothing, spent nothing. The

only thing he did was to remove

the bars outside the window...

JACK

Hello...

JANI

Jack! It's Jani.

JACK

Jani! Where are you?

JANI

Sun City. I've been meaning to

call you for months.

JACK

(smiles)

How are you?

JANI

Great. I'm getting married. At

least, I think I am.

JACK

Did you solve your problems?

JANI

Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack,

hold on a minute. There's someone

here who wants to talk to you...

JACK SR'S VOICE

Jacko - how're you doing?

JACK

Dad!

JACK SR

I never thanked you properly for

your help. Jani told me you behaved

like a perfect gentleman throughout.

I knew you would. I know my son.

JACK SR'S VOICE

The woman thinks I'm going to marry

her. But you know me. It's a shame

things didn't work out. But we saw

you all right. You didn't gamble

the ten grand, did you?

JACK

(huskily)

As a matter of fact I did. But I

won.

JACK SR'S VOICE

That's my boy. How's that novel of

yours coming along?

JACK'S VOICE

So that was it. The final card.

Blackjack. His father, eight

thousand miles and twenty seven

years away, was still dealing to

his son Jack from the bottom of

the deck...

JACK'S VOICE

...But Jake the croupier had a

sense of humour.

JACK

To you. To both of you.

BELLA

What are you laughing at? Who was

that on the phone?

JACK

A couple I know are getting married.

BELLA

Fools.

JACK'S VOICE

Now he had reached the point where

he no longer heard the sound of

the ball...

JACK'S VOICE

...the spin of the wheel had brought

him home to the place where he was

born.

JACK'S VOICE

The croupier's mission was

accomplished.

JACK'S VOICE

At last he was Master of the Game.

He had aquired the power... to

make you lose.

FADE OUT:
