CHAD

Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum

Monster in Hi-Def videostream-

RYAN

C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on

CHAD

(through cup-holding

teeth)

Sweet. It's going to my email

right now.

RYAN

Watch it dude, I gotta return that

thing in seven days.

CHAD

They aren't giving you shit yet?

RYAN

Nah, whenever I return it, I just

list off why the phone sucks and

they give me a new model. Figure

by the tenth time I'll have to go

somewhere else.

CUT TO:

CHAD

Go already. No one's looking.

CHAD (CONT'D)

(re: wallet)

Need me to hold that?

RYAN

Waterproof.

RYAN (CONT'D)

This is stupid. I could get

killed. Pick another dare.

CHAD

My ass. Not after you made me

Transmitting pussy file now.

RYAN

Got any more? I'm here to help.

CHLOE

Thanks, but no, we got 'em all.

RYAN

What's in 'em?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Cool, you're handing these out

during the concert?

CHLOE

Yeah, wanna help?

RYAN

Hell yeah.     I'm all about "Heal the

Bay. "

RYAN (CONT'D)

Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup

thing, of course...

RYAN (CONT'D)

We've collected water samples with

the Stream Team, raised money on

the Promenade... I'm surprised I

haven't seen you.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Ryan.

CHLOE

Chloe.

CHLOE (CONT'D)

I can't tell if you're full of it.

RYAN

You ever go up to Santa Barbara?

My dad used to take me there all

RYAN (CONT'D)

the time. Their pier is amazing,

clear water, huge crabs everywhere,

oysters right there on the rocks,

starfish... Hard to believe it's

the same ocean sometimes.

CHLOE

Maybe you and I can take a break

later when Pat Benatar goes on.

RYAN

Sounds like a plan.

CHLOE

Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to

pick up a box of T-shirts at the

Kinkos on Venice.

RYAN

I'll do it for you... if you want.

CHLOE

Seriously, you would?

RYAN

Sure.     How much is the bill?

CHLOE

Nothing.    It's been paid up front.

RYAN

Do you promise not to go anywhere?

CHLOE

Done.

RYAN

Okay, I won't be long.

CHLOE

(laughing)

Bye.

RYAN

Dude, does Santa Barbara have a

harbor or a pier?

CUT TO:

RYAN

(into phone)

Dex, wassup? You won't believe the

hotties I just met at the pier.

Smoking. You wanna meet them?

Yeah? Well don't get too excited

'cause I need my money.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Bullshit, you're not going

anywhere,

(quickly adding)

I'm pulling up right now.

RYAN (CONT'D)

(covering his ear)

What? Yeah, you better be. And I

need your shower, I'm talkin' code

red stankage-

RYAN (CONT'D)

(into phone)

Dex? You still there...?

RYAN (CONT'D)

Damn.

SFX:   THE CELLPHONE RINGS.

Ryan picks up the phone.

RYAN

Sorry, got cut off.      Hey -- what's

my Caller ID say?

But there's no voice on the other end, only shuffling sounds.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Yo Dex...?

MATCH CUT TO:

ECU - A TANGLE OF PHONE WIRES

the attic floor, past the rubble of the shattered phone,

foll9wing the crudely repaired wires to JESSICA'S HANDS,

tapping the dialer wires together. She's trying so hard to

simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear:

RYAN (VO)

Hello...?

Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head

slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a

desperate hope filling her eyes.

CUT BACK TO:

With still no answer, Ryan pulls the phone from his ear --

RYAN

Whatever.    Signing off-

-- and is just about to hit END CALL when he hears a tiny

female voice on the other end.

JESSICA (VO)

Wait!    Don't hang up!

Ryan puts the phone back to his ear.

RYAN

Hello?

JESSICA (VO)

There's not much time! I need you

to go to the police. My name is

Jessica Martin; I've been kidnapped!

RYAN

(not buying)

Oh really? Kidnapped, huh?

JESSICA (VO)

Please. I know what you're

thinking, but it's real! I'm in an

attic somewhere. I think they're

going to kill me! You need to-

RYAN

Awfully polite kidnappers to give

you a phone...

Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably.        Desperate, fearful

and frustrated.

JESSICA (VO)

No!   You don't understand!

Suddenly, the cellphone BLIPS twice in Ryan's ear.          He pulls

it away and looks at its faceplate.

The LCD reads:     CALL WAITING.   ACCEPT?

RYAN

If you were really in trouble, you

would've called the cops, not me.

Now I've got a real call on the

other line--

MATCH CUT TO:

A WIDER SHOT so we see Jessica's bound hands. Her bruised

face. Whispering frantically into the DEMOLISHED TELEPHONE

she's JERI-RIGGING back together as she talks.

JESSICA (VO)

Goddamn it, listen to me! The

phone I'm on...it's shattered!

There's no dialer! I've been

clicking wires together for hours

trying to get someone, anyone, and

you 're the only connection I was

able to make!

(important beat)

If you hang up, I may not get

anyone else.

SFX: Ryan's call waiting BLIPS again.        He considers

everything Jessica has said, then:

RYAN

Hmm. Sucks to be you. Try crank

yanking someone else. Late.

JESSICA

Wait!     Don't hang up!    DON'T HANG UP!!

But -- CLICK!       Ryan flashes over to the next call.

RYAN

Dex?

MATCH CUT TO:

A TELEMARKETER checks Ryan's name on a list, then glances at

the script.

TELEMARKETER

Hello, Mr. Ackerman. My name is

Mark and I'd like to discuss with

you the benefits of Mastercharge

Credit Union's-

RYAN (VO)

Awesome, I can totally use a credit

card. Tell me more.

TELEMARKETER

Absolutely.     We've lowered our APR-

RYAN

-Shucks, now's really not a good

time, but why don't I get your

number and get back to you later.

TELEMARKETER

Sure, it's 818...

RYAN

That's the office number?

TELEMARKETER

Yes.

RYAN

Why don't you give me your number

instead. That way I can call you

when you're having dinner with your

family.

A beat.

TELEMARKETER

Sorry to have bothered you.

Click!    The Telemarketer hangs up.

RYAN

Damn skippy.

And that's when he notices the message flashing on the

phone's faceplate: CALL ON HOLD. Ryan clicks the FLASH

button to pick it up...and Jessica is still there.

JESSICA (VO)

--an you hear me?!

RYAN

You still there? You're getting

kinda creepy, lady. See ya.

JESSICA

No!    Don't! They're going to kill

me!    They're going to kill me!!

RYAN

Oh, it's like that, huh?     Nice with

the fake tears, lady...

JESSICA

Please...   I just need help.

RYAN

You need acting lessons. Now go take

your meds and bug someone else.

JESSICA

These men!!!--

JESSICA (CONT'D)

These men killed my housekeeper.

My dog. You have to help me.

RYAN

No, actually( I don't. Not with a

hot chick waiting for me at the

pier.

JESSICA

Please...you're my only hope.

(beat)

What's your name?

RYAN

Why, you writing a book--?

JESSICA

--Please, just tell me your name!

Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone

fountain outside a French Restaurant.

RYAN

Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain.

JESSICA

Johnny... What if it was your

mother who was calling for help?

How would you feel?

RYAN

Well, I'd be damn impressed,

considering she's dead.

JESSICA

Goddamn it, how difficult is it to

hand this phone off to the police?!

I'll pay you!

RYAN

How much?

JESSICA

Five thousand dollars.

RYAN

Sure you will. I'm hanging up now.

JESSICA

No, wait! WAIT!! Even if there's

a eighty percent chance I'm lying,

you nave a one in five chance to

make five grand f9r a lousy twenty

minutes of your life.

(panics as Ryan is silent)

Haven't you ever bet on a horse or

bought a Lottery ticket? I'm

talking one-in-five odds, twenty

minutes.

Ryan slaps the radio off.

RYAN

What do you want me to do?

CUT TO:

SOMEONE'S POV.

In EXTREME SLOW-MOTION, chaos unfolds around us like a

nightmare --

OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward the back, a HOOKER screams

at us with unholy rage, in the far corner, a JUNKIE spits on

an OFFICER'S FACE and there's a lethal race for disinfectant

through invisible soup.

Sounds are distant, eerily muffled.      A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE

lets us know we're in hell.

CLOSE UP:    BOB MOONEY'S EYES.    Concerned, but not panicked.

MOONEY'S POV. Still surreal, SLOW-MOTION, as an Officer with

a CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkie's face into a wall,

legal but hard.

SFX:   A HEARTBEAT.    OURS.    FAST... And possibly IRREGULAR?

CLOSE UP - SLOW MOTION - The RIGHT THUMB presses into the

LEFT WRIST.

MOONEY'S EYES.      Watching.   Counting... Suddenly --

WHAM!! Back to reality when a YOUNG GANGBANGER is slammed

into the station desk by a ROOKIE.

ROOKIE OFFICER

Problem, Mooney. If I put this one

in with the others, there's gonna

be a bloodbath.

GANGBANGER

Put me in there! I'll waste all

them pussies!

REVEAL SERGEANT BOB MOONEY -- a tough, fifty-something beat

cop who's fighting growing old every step of the way. He

rolls his eyes at the situation and takes a bite of PIZZA.

MOONEY

Come on Powell, put the Sharks with

the Sharks, the Jets with the Jets

and make room.

Rookie Powell suppresses his irritation and roughly yanks the

Gangbanger back over to the holding cells.

Mooney puts down the pizza, no appetite, and stares at the

news story playing on the TV mounted in the corner.

a NEWS REPORTER is in the middle of a segment. Over him,

FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops testifying in court;

being led away in handcuffs.

NEWS REPORTER

...was somber when the indictments

came down this afternoon in the

23rd Precinct corruption scandal.

Though the names of six police

officers were read aloud, the

District Attorney stated that this

was merely the "tip of the iceberg"

and that unfortunately many other

arrests are likely to be coming as

the investigations proceed.

As DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN passes Mooney, he nods toward the TV.

DETECTIVE TOMLIN

Sucks for the fellas at the Two-

Three right now, huh?

MOONEY

Dirty pricks deserve what they get.

Public hates us enough without this

shit.

DETECTIVE TOMLIN

(leaving)

There's good men over there.

A FEMALE OFFICER passes Mooney and reaches for his box of

pizza.

FEMALE OFFICER

Mooney? What are you doing?      You can't

be eating this crap.

Mooney plants his own firm grip on the box.

MOONEY

Keep walking, Shelly.   Nothing to

see here.

A friendly tug of war.

FEMALE OFFICER

You sure you wanna do that?     What

would your wife say?

That's it. Mooney snatches his lunch back and turns to

lecture this little girl.

MOONEY

She'd say nothing, 'cause she's not

gonna know about it! Christ, Shel,

my old man had eleven heart

attacks. Eleven! I have one

little infarction and you guys

start treating me like an invalid!

I'm a grown man! Leave me alone,

will you?!

FEMALE OFFICER

(abashed)

I was merely referring to your

cottage-cheese ass.

Mooney sighs and lifts his pizza to his mouth when --

WHAMM! The station doors burst open and two dozen GANG

MEMBERS are bum-rushed into the room by a squad of COPS in

riot gear. The screaming is deafening.

17.

MOONEY

I hate this place.

CUT TO:

The Ford Bronco roars up; snags the handicapped spot. Ryan

hops out and limps theatrically the first few steps until

he's far enough away from the car to start running.

RYAN

(into phone)

I'm here.

Cops try to wrangle the dozens of shouting GANG MEMBERS who

cram the Station Desk, waiting to be booked.

Ryan takes a deep breath and shoves his way through the

mayhem to the extremely shorthanded Station Desk where:

MOONEY

is busy doing ten things at once. Signing release papers.

Booking a DRUNK whose wife-beater Tee is drenched in blood,

Etc.

RYAN

Excuse me, officer --

But Mooney ignores him in favor of the three cops that

suddenly need arrest sheets signed.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Hey, I've got an emergency here --

Just then, CREWCUT OFFICER shoulders his way through with a

cuffed CRACKHEAD TRANNIE in tow. The Trannie's wrists ache.

CRACKHEAD TRANNIE

Loosen these, man, please?! Jus'

gimme a chance--

CREWCUT OFFICER

Hey, Moon! Where do you want me to

put Whitney Houston?

MOONEY

Christ, I've only got two hands here!

Stick him in the can, will ya?

Crewcut nods and moves off towards the bathroom.

RYAN

(shoving forward)

Come on, man! I've got some lady

on the phone here who says she's

been kidnapped!

18.

Ryan holds up the phone.         Mooney looks around.

MOONEY

Nice try, kid, but I got no time

for pranks.

RYAN

Seriously, a lady was murdered!

MOONEY

Which is it, a kidnapping or a

murder?

RYAN

Take the phone and find out moron!

A COP snickers somewhere.

MATCH CUT TO:

Jessica holds her breath. She stares apprehensively at the

attic door, praying for Mooney to just take the damn phone.

JESSICA

Please. . .

Ryan looks sincere.     Mooney deliberates, then sighs.

MOONEY

Okay.   Give it here.

Ryan thrusts the phone at him, happy to get rid of it.

JESSICA (VO)

(barely audible whisper)

Oh thank God! You've got to help

me. My name's Jessica Martin and

I've been kidnapped. This morning

five men broke into my home in

Brentwood and kidnapped--

Mooney strains to hear.     His eyes go wide and he quickly jots

notes on a pad.

Mooney's eyes shift as three TWEAKERS, wide eyed and sweating

profusely, are led inside by their ARRESTING OFFICERS.

MOONEY

Ah shit.

Mooney holds out the phone.

MOONEY (CONT'D)

Hurry kid, take this upstairs to

Robbery/Homicide and ask for

Detective Tomlin.

19.

Ryan reluctantly takes the phone back as more people converge

on the Station Desk.

Jessica hears the phone being shuffled around.

RYAN (VO)

Where?

JESSICA

Hello?    Officer? Hello?!

Mooney, recognizing an emergency when he hears one, ignores

the incoming CROWD him long enough to assist Ryan.

MOONEY

Up the stairs, Tomlin!

Ryan turns away, and as he returns the cellphone to his ear,

he's startled to hear--

JESSICA (VO)

(terrified)

Oh my God...

RYAN

What? What is it?

CUT TO:

Jessica hears:

SFX: FOOTSTEPS.     RIGHT OUTSIDE HER DOOR.

RYAN (VO)

Lady, what's going on?!

Jessica drops the phone. Has just enough time to shove it

behind her before -- SLAM! -- the attic door swings open and

two of the masked kidnappers stride in. When they reach her,

they stand silently, trying to unnerve her.

LEAD KIDNAPPER

Where's your husband?

JESSICA

What?     I don't-

The masked leader SLAPS HER SHARPLY across the face! Jessica

wants to collapse to the ground, but remains sitting TO KEEP

THE PHONE HIDDEN behind her.

The Leader bends down and yells right in her face.

20.

LEAD KIDNAPPER

Where is he!?

JESSICA

At work!     Why, what do you want--?

SLAP!!!   This one's even nastier than the first.

LEAD KIDNAPPER

NEGATIVE!    WHERE WOULD HE RUN?!

MATCH CUT TO:

Phone to his ear. Wide-eyed. Hearing it all.         For the first

time, starting to believe Jessica's story.

RYAN

Oh shit...

Panicking, Ryan turns and walks, then jogs, then all-out runs

for the station stairwell.

CUT BACK TO:

31   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                               31

The Lead Kidnapper stands ominously over the trembling

Jessica -- Oh God! Does he see the phone cord?

JESSICA

Please, he should be at work!

That's all I know.

The Leader nods, then turns away. Jessica exhales with

relief that he didn't spot the phone. But her victory is

short-lived as:

LEAD KIDNAPPER

You have a little boy, right? Ricky?

The Wyman School in Westwood?

Jessica gasps like a sledgehammer just hit her in the chest.

JESSICA

NO! NO--.'.' STAY AWAY FROM MY SON!

LEAVE HIM ALONE!!

But -- the men silently head out the door -- SLAM!       The door

locks. Jessica scrambles back to the phone.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

Johnny!!

RYAN

I know.    I'm trying to get help.

21.

JESSICA

My son --

Suddenly, as Ryan reaches the first landing -- STATIC starts

breaking up the call.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

(worried)

Oh my God! What's happening?!

RYAN

It's just static. I'm running

upstairs to the detectives. Hold

on, I might lose you for a sec--

JESSICA (VO)

(realizing)

No, don't! Stop. You can't lose

me--

RYAN

(still running)

Wait, we're almost there.

JESSICA

(panics, losing her cool)

Stop! Johnny, goddamn it, stop!

STOP! IF YOU LOSE ME, I'M DEAD!!

Hearing her fearful tone, Ryan stops reluctantly.

RYAN

Well, what the hell am I supposed

to do?!

Ryan looks at himself, standing on the stairs like an idiot.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Jesus!   I'm almost there!

Ryan checks the SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR on the phone.

There's only one bar left. Defiantly, Ryan takes a step

UP...and the bar DISAPPEARS. He quickly hops BACK DOWN.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Crap!

(shouts up stairs)

HELLO? DETECTIVE TOMLIN! WILL

SOMEONE GET TOMLIN FOR ME, PLEASE?!

There's no response.   Ryan can't believe this.

RYAN (CONT'D)

You're shitting me.

JESSICA

Johnny, what time is it?! Johnny!

RYAN

(checking his watch)

Who? Oh -- one-twenty.

(MORE)

22.

RYAN (CONT'D)

(yells upstairs)

IS ANYONE UP THERE?!

Jessica calms herself, resolving to save her child's life.

JESSICA

Johnny, listen to me. My son's

school lets out at 1:45.

RYAN

Good, then if I get a cop--

Ryan exits the stairwell to find Mooney -- but Mooney's not

there anymore! There's some NEW GUY -- and he's SWAMPED!

JESSICA

No. There's not enough time. You

have to pick him up before they--

RYAN

Pick him up? Hell no, lady!     I

ain't goin' nowhere else--

Ryan tries to get the NEW GUY's attention, in a dream.

JESSICA

Please please stop standing there!

He 's just a little boy!

RYAN

But I'm in a police station!

JESSICA

Go!

Ryan grunts in frustration.

SMASH CUT TO:

ECU - THE FORD BRONCO'S TIRES -- Burning rubber...

CUT TO:

The furniture in this abandoned house is all covered with

sheets giving the entire place a creepy, haunted feel.

FOLLOW the LEAD KIDNAPPER as he descends a nearby stairwell

and pulls off his mask--

REVEAL GREER

Forties, salt and pepper hair.    He looks to his crew:

THE KIDNAPPERS

23.

They're all trim. Athletic. In good shape. They're

UNMASKED, watching the TV with interest. The news on the

corruption scandal.

Greer snaps the TV off.     Checks his watch and nods grimly.

GREEK

Go get the kid.

Instantly, a hulk of a man (DEASON) and an arrogant, red-

headed prick (ELLIS) stand and exit the house.

As Greer stalks away( BOOM DOWN the bar to REVEAL a telephone

sitting there, unnoticed by the men -- and on its face, the

LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR LIGHT is lit.

PUSH IN on the flashing orange light that threatens to give

Ryan and Jessica's call away. Closer and closer, until we

ENTER the phone and TRAVEL THROUGH THE WIRES to --

As we PULL BACK we see that we're in the Ford Bronco, racing

through:

Ryan guns the engine as Jessica panics on the other end of

the phone. We can hear her hyperventilating.

JESSICA (VO)

Where are you now?!

RYAN

I just got off the 405.

JESSICA (VO)

You've got to go faster, Johnny!

RYAN

You've gotta chill! You're

stressing the crap out of me!

(looking around)

Where the hell is a cop hiding in a

speed trap when you need one?

Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing.    Pushing it against

his better judgment.

RYAN (CONT'D)

What do these guys want, anyway?

JESSICA (VO)

How should I know?!

RYAN

What do you do?

JESSICA

I'm an obstetrician. They don't

want anything from me.

24.

Ryan slaloms around other cars like a racecar driver.

RYAN

So your husband's like, uber-rich?

JESSICA (VO)

What--? No. He's an accountant.

I make more money than he does.

RYAN

Could they've mistaken you for

someone else?

JESSICA

No! I don't know.    None of this

makes any sense.

Jessica starts losing it completely, upsetting Ryan so much

that he takes the next corner too fast and -- SKKRRASH! --

The BRONCO EXPLODES through an orange-and-white "ROAD CLOSED"

CONSTRUCTION BARRIER!

And dead ahead is a CONSTRUCTION CREW resurfacing the road!

RYAN

Oh...SHIT!!

Ryan SLAMS on the brakes and SWERVES to avoid hitting a group

of workers -- and OBLITERATES THE BRONCO'S PASSENGER SIDE

MIRROR against another BARRIER --

Ryan cringes with every muscle!

And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes

through the windshield of a recently waxed Acura Legend!

RYAN (CONT'D)

(smirking)

...Ain't that a bitch.

As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit

out of him, Ryan floors the gas, sending a shower of wet

asphalt all over the cursing workers as he peels away,

CRASHING through a FINAL BARRIER.

More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and --

RYAN (CONT'D)

There's the school.

Ryan's right.   Just ahead, we see:

private prep school for boys. Ryan pull: A private prep

it. Walks quickly toward the building.    school for

boys. Ryan

pulls over and hops

out,

25.

RYAN

Okay, I'm here.

JESSICA (VO)

How much time do we have?

Ryan checks his watch.     It reads:   "1:40 PM".   He enters.

RYAN

Five minutes. What's your kid's name?

JESSICA (VO)

Ricky.

RYAN

Ricky what?

JESSICA

Martin.

RYAN

Ricky Martin? You named your kid

Ricky Martin?! Why didn't you

tattoo "kick me" on his ass while

you were at it?

JESSICA

He was named before the singer ever-

RYAN

Forget it.     What does he look like?

JESSICA (VO)

He's eight years old. Blonde hair.

Green eyes. Small for his age.

He's wearing a light blue shirt and

dark blue pants--

RYAN

They're all wearing blue shirts and

pants!

Ryan turns down a hallway and we see that he's right.      It's

filled with IDENTICALLY-UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS.

As a TIMID BLONDE BOY passes in front of him, Ryan grabs him

and wheels him around.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Ricky Martin?

The Boy's eyes get huge.     He tries to pull away.

TIMID BOY

Don't touch me!

RYAN

No, kid, it's okay!    I didn't mean

to--

26.

TIMID BOY

Help!   Don't touch me!   Don't touch!!

Ryan quickly moves on... aware that other ADULTS are now

beginning to take notice of him.

RYAN (INTO PHONE)

Does he have anything else? A

jacket? A backpack? What's his

lunch box look like?

JESSICA (VO)

I don't remember.

RYAN

You don't remember your own kid's

lunch box?!

JESSICA

I don't pack it! Rosario, our

housekeeper does! Sometimes Craig,

but...

Jessica begins to sob, which causes Ryan to panic further.

RYAN

Ricky Martin, where are you!?

None of the Stepford kids respond.

JESSICA (VO)

(through tears)

I wish I could give you more.

Now Ryan's running.    He yells into a BATHROOM.

RYAN

Ricky Martin?

MALE VOICE (OS)

Can I help you, sir?

Ryan turns to see a MUSCULAR GYM TEACHER looming there.

Clearly, the guy thinks Ryan's peeping into the boys' room.

RYAN

I'm looking for a little blond boy--

(off his shocked look)

--No, no! Not like that!

GYM TEACHER

Sir, come with me, please!

Ryan isn't going anywhere. And that's when the BELL RINGS.

Like a nightmare, HUNDREDS OF UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS come

racing out of their classes.

RYAN

Oh shit...

27.

As the boys stampede by, Ryan yanks the WHISTLE from around

the Gym Teacher's thick neck and starts blowing it like

crazy.

GYM TEACHER

HEY--11

RYAN

RICKY MARTIN! DOES ANYONE KNOW

WHERE RICKY MARTIN IS?1 I can't

believe I'm yelling this at an all-

boys school.

All hell is breaking loose. The kids ignore him. The huge

Gym Teacher races after him. Jessica yells in his ear.

JESSICA (VO)

Was that the bell? Was that the

bell?!

RYAN

Yes.    RICKY! RICKY MARTIN!!

Ryan wades through the sea of uniforms.

JESSICA (VO)

He'11 go to the parents' pick-up

spot. Oh God, they're going to get

him!

Ryan turns around and starts bulling through.    The Gym

Teacher violently grabs his arm and yanks--

GYM TEACHER

Where do you think you're going?

--causing the phone to fly out of Ryan's hand and --crack!--

hit the pavement.

RYAN

No--!

Ryan tugs his arm free and races to the phone.   The LCD

display GLASS is cracked into a SPIDERWEB.

RYAN (CONT'D)

(desperate into phone)

Jessica? You still there?!

JESSICA (VO)

Yes?

Relieved, Ryan turns and races for the front of the school.

RYAN

No one's gonna get your kid!    He's

not slow, is he?

JESSICA (VO)

What--?   No!

28.

RYAN

Then he won't go anywhere with

strangers.

JESSICA (VO)

Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky'11

think it's Rosario and hop right in!

She's got a point. Ryan picks up the pace and arrives at the

pick-up spot. Scans the lot.

RYAN

What color?

JESSICA

Black!

RYAN

(looks)

Of course it is.

PAN AROUND to see what Ryan sees -- three black Cadillac

Escalades.

RYAN (CONT'D)

There's three of them.    What's your

plate?

JESSICA (VO)

4..7..wait, no...3 -- Oh my God, I

don't remember!

RYAN

Like you don't remember the lunch

box? Or anything else about your

kid--

(stops, realizing)

Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't

it?

JESSICA (VO)

No!

RYAN

Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady.

Your friends too. Getting me to

scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys

school. Damn, you really nailed

me.

JESSICA (VO)

No--

This is great, the police think I'm

a whack job. The school thinks I'm

some kind of perv child molester.

I'll probably get the Herpes from

the gym teacher's whistle --

29.

JESSICA (VO)

No, Johnny, you have to listen to

me-- /.'

But Ryan's had enough.     He turns to leave --

RYAN

I'm done being your entertainment for

the day. I'm going back to the pier

while I still have a chance --

-- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT-

YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan

hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides

"screw it", and keeps on hoofing.

Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym

Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD.

GYM TEACHER

Here he is! He's the one that's

been stalking the students.

RYAN

Stalking?!     No, I can explain--

The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie.

RENT-A-COP #1

Okay, we got him. We're at the

front of the school.

(then, to Ryan)

Sir, come with us.

RYAN

(as they grab him)

Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!!    Hang on a

sec! This is a huuuge

misunderstanding--

A little RENT-A-COP CAR (think geeky, wanna-be cop car) pulls

up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly

leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close--

JESSICA (VO)

(interrupting)

Lord of the Rings! I forgot his

father bought him a Lord of the

Rings lunchbox last week!

Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy

with the Lord or the Rings lunchbox racing down the school

steps and up to one of the waiting Escalades.

RYAN

(struggling)

RICKY MARTIN!!

The Boy opens the car door...but turns as he hears his name

called. For the briefest moment, Ricky and Ryan lock eyes--

[CONTINUED)

30.

38                                                                    38

--and that's when a HAND reaches out, snags his backpack and

YANKS Ricky into the dark of the car! Instantly, the door

slams shut and the Escalade begins to take off.

WHIP PAN to Ryan's shocked reaction. He's the only one who's

seen it. He tries to struggle free of the Guard.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Oh shit!    You just see that?!

Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner

in the car.

RENT-A-COP #1

Roy, some help over here!

Below, the Escalade is leaving the driveway.

RYAN

(struggling harder)

Goddamn it, that little kid was

just kidnapped!! Do something!!

RENT-A-COP #1

Roy--! !

The second Rent-a-Cop, hops out of his car and runs over, but

as he gets near -- Ryan breaks free!

RENT-A-COPS

HEY--! !

They chase after him, but Ryan hops over the hood of the

idling RENT-A-COP CAR and throws himself into its driver's

seat.

Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs

Ryan's collar -- and is dragged twenty feet as Ryan throws

the little car in gear and burns away.

Trying to catch the Escalade, a quarter-mile ahead. Ryan

feels completely conspicuous in the security car as he

slaloms through the streets of East Hollywood.

JESSICA (VO)

What's happening, Ryan?!

RYAN

Don't worry, I can fix this.

JESSICA (VO)

Oh my God.

There are three cars between Ryan and the Escalade.

RYAN

It's okay, I can see them ahead.

31.

JESSICA (VO)

Don't lose them! If you follow them

back here, you can tell the police

where they're holding us!

RYAN

Okay.

CUT TO:

The mountainous Deason drives as Ellis sits shotgun. In the

back sits Jessica's son, RICKY; who eyes the two men

suspiciously. CCR plays on the RADIO.

Ellis, turns down the radio.       Faking sincerity, he turns to

face Ricky.

ELLIS

(gesturing to the radio)

Do you want me to change the

station to something else?

Ricky refuses to answer.        Ellis turns around, his fake smile

quickly vanishing.

ELLIS (CONT'D)

Yeah.   I like Creedence too.

He's about to turn the radio volume up when --

RICKY

Where's Rosario?

ELLIS

I told you, kid, she had a doctor's

appointment, so your mother asked

us to pick you up. Don't worry,

you'll see your mommy in a few

minutes.

Ricky nods... but we can tell by the look on his face that

he's not buying their story one bit.

CUT BACK TO:

Cautiously, so as not to give himself away, Ryan PASSES one

commuter car. Then the next. Narrowing the gap between the

rent-a-cop car and the Escalade to one last auto.

It takes Ryan literally standing on the gas pedal to get up

enough speed to get around the final car. Now the Escalade

is dead ahead. Ryan begins gently closing the distance

between them, and is just starting to relax, when--

A CITY BUS

merges into traffic from a Bus Stop right ahead of him!

32.

RYAN

SHIT!

Ryan SLAMS on his breaks and is forced to crawl along at a

ainful 25 m.p.h.. Worse, he has his view of the Escalade

JESSICA (VO)

Johnny!

RYAN

Damn!     There's this stupid bus--

Ryan jags left and right, catching glimpses around the bus of

the Escalade still ahead.

RYAN (CONT'D)

(taps his horn)

Come on!

But the bus doesn't pull over. Ryan tries flashing the

security car's CLEAR BUBBLE LIGHTS on the roof, but who the

hell would pull over for that? The bus sure doesn't.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Jesus.'

JESSICA (VO)

Can't you go around it?

There's an ungodly amount of opposing traffic--

But suddenly there's    a break in the  flow! Seizing the

moment, Ryan SLAM-SH   IFTS the rent-a -cop car's uni-cylinder

engine into gear and    starts to tear  around the bus -- but has

to SWERVE BACK as a    SPEEDING TRASH  TRUCK rounds a bend and

almost creams him!

RYAN

Goddamn it!

JESSICA (VO)

What?!    Did you lose him? !

RYAN

No, I just almost got killed, is

all.

JESSICA

Oh thank God!

RYAN

Thank God?

(irritated)

That's nice.

Just then, the bus signals that it's pulling over.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Hey, here we go!

33.

As the bus pulls aside, Ryan floors the wanna-be cop car

around it...but directly in front of him is a HOMELESS MAN,

dressed like a sheik, dragging his caravan of TWO COVERED

SHOPPING CARTS.

RYAN (CONT'D)

SON- OF- A-- II

Ryan SLAMS on    the brakes, SWERVES HARD to avoid a collision --

and loses cont   rol of the car! The rent-a-cop car goes POWER

SLIDING across    oncoming traffic, HORNS BLARING AT HIM and

heads straight    for a the FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOW of a CAR

DEALERSHIP.

SMASH!!! The car goes through the window and RACES down the

center aisle. CAR SALESMEN and PATRONS are forced to dive

out of the way as the rent-a-cop car MOWS DOWN DISPLAYS and

everything else in its path.

CUT TO:

The mountainous Deason drives. In back, Ellis sits with

Jessica's son, RICKY, who eyes the two men suspiciously.

CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL plays on the RADIO.

ELLIS

(to Deason)

Anyone following us?

Deason checks:

THE REARVIEW MIRROR

We see the bus about five car lengths behind, but the rent-a-

cop car is nowhere to be seen.

Deason flashes an evil grin.

DEASON

Nan.

CUT BACK TO:

The rent-a-cop car exits the dealership, SMASHING through

another GLASS WINDOW!

Ryan quickly regains control of the car and steers it back on

the street. Only to find that the Escalade has disappeared!

JESSICA (VO)

What's happening?! Are you okay?!

RYAN

SHIT I

34.

JESSICA (VO)

What?!    Yo u lost--

RYAN

No, No!    just give me a second--

As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses

on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine

CLATTERING, to the intersection.

Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade

is nowhere to be seen. He floors it.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Jesus!    Where the hell did they go?

Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the

receiver.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Jessica, I--

JESSICA (VO)

You let them get away.

Ryan wants to snap at her, but guilt crushes it right out of

him. He knows she's right.

DISSOLVE TO:

Mooney changes out of his blues, his ears glued to THREE COPS

in the corner, boasting about an arrest.

COP ONE

-- so of course everyone's playing

dumb to what kind of drugs he's on.

The cops start to snicker; they've all heard that one before.

COP ONE (CONT'D)

So I start searching the place.

I'm about to open a closet door

when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out

of the bathroom. He shoots.

Misses me and hits one of the

E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun

jams and BAM! Blows half his face

off. Had enough black tar heroin

in the closet to resurface the 405.

Mooney tries to join in on the conversation.

MOONEY

It must've been around '84, when...

The Cops turn around, while grabbing their stuff.

35.

COP TWO

Sorry Moon, we're late for a

briefing.

Mooney waves them on, but looks disappointed for not being

able to join in.

DEEP MALE VOICE (O.S.)

I'll bet in your day you had some

stories.

Mooney whips his head around to see DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN.

MOONEY

Hey Tomlin.

DETECTIVE TOMLIN

Taking off?

MOONEY

(hardly thrilled)

My anniversary. You know, duty

calls; pricey dinner and then some

crap-ass play.

(beat)

Hey, I sent some college kid down

to see you this morning. Had some

rap about a kidnapping --

DETECTIVE TOMLIN

I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask

around. Kidnapping, huh?

MOONEY

I thought it was a prank at first,

but the kid was so worked up--

DETECTIVE TOMLIN

Well, don't you get worked up.

(slaps Mooney's chest)

If the kid comes back, page me, and

I'll be sure to see him.

MOONEY

(swallowing his pride)

Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks.

And as Tomlin walks off --

CUT TO:

Ryan lead-foots the gas. The speedometer climbs.   Forty.

Fifty. Sixty miles an hour.

JESSICA (VO)

Look, Johnny, you've got to go back

to the cops--

36.

RYAN

Are you high?! I just jacked a car!

JESSICA (VO)

Goddamn it, stop thinking about

just yourself! You can explain

everything to them later!

SUDDENLY -- SFX: RYAN'S PHONE BEGINS BEEPING.

RYAN

What now?

Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out.

INSERT SHOT - CELLPHONE FACE PLATE

The BATTERY INDICATOR is flashing:         LOW BATT.   LOW BATT.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Great!   Now the battery's dying.

JESSICA

Don't you have a charger?

RYAN

It's in my car!      Hold on.

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!    The battery indicator has lost another bar.

Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens

the glovebox and -- a snub-nosed .38 SPECIAL tumbles out.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Jesus -- !

JESSICA

What's going on? Did you find one?

RYAN

(staring at the gun)

Not exactly...

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!!     Jessica starts growing afraid.

JESSICA

Johnny, don't lose me!

RYAN

Well what the hell do you expect me

to do?!

Just then, Ryan rounds a corner -- and sees traffic GRIDLOCKED

to a halt ahead. He tries to maneuver around it, but is

almost immediately boxed in.

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!

JESSICA

Johnny--!

37.

RYAN

I know, Jessica!

The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And

traffic isn't going anywhere. Ryan looks around desperately.

Nothing. No emergency lane. No shoulder. Just a long drop

down a HILL to a strip mall below--

STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of

the store's signs: "VERIZON WIRELESS".

Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter-

mile ahead -- but at this rate, it'll take forever to make it

there.

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP...'.'

Ryan's got to do something.      Now.

RYAN (CONT'D)

You know that money you promised me?

JESSICA (VO)

Yes.

RYAN

I'm giving myself a raise.

And with that, Ryan CRANKS the steering wheel hard right and

HITS THE GAS!   Despite other drivers' protests, the little

Rent-a-Cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock, TEARS through

the rusty GUARD RAIL and -- VROOOOM! -- flies off the side of

the hill!

Ryan lets out a frightened yell as he SAILS through the clear

blue sky.

RYAN

HOOOOLLYYY SHIIII--

THUMP! The Rent-a-Cop car touches down on a steep downslope.

Ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile,

miraculously avoiding the minefield of ROCKS and TREE STUMPS.

He needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its

antenna in his teeth.

There's so much noise, the only thing Jessica could possibly

hear is a CACOPHONY OF NOISE and Ryan HYPERVENTILATING.

JESSICA (VO)

What's going on?!

RYAN

(with phone in teeth)

mmmrrmph mrm mrmph!

Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until

the car hits a jutting rock and -- WHOOOOM! -- goes up on two

wheels. It looks like it's going to roll but gravity brings

38.

it back down -- SLAMM! -- so hard that the phone goes flying

across the car!

RYAN (CONT'D)

Shit!

Ryan scrabbles for the phone -- but gives it up when he

bounces over a rise and sees A BILLBOARD DEAD AHEAD!

RYAN (CONT'D)

WHOAAAAAA!

Ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the

billboard's concrete posts, but -- WHAM! -- obliterates the

rent-a-cop's BUBBLE LIGHTS on the billboard's lower edge.

Somehow, Ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the

rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot, where

it SKIDS OUT.

RYAN (CONT'D)

(grabbing phone)

Jessica?! Can you hear me?!

JESSICA (VO)

I'm here!

Ryan hops out and races inside--

And of course, they're having a sale and the place is packed.

Every SALESPERSON is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy.

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!

Panicking, Ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter --

IRATE CUSTOMERS

Hey, what do you think you're

doing? There's a line!

-- to the OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN helping someone else.

OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN

..and if you get the new Nokia

9200, you can switch out faceplates

to match your mood! And we have a

special today on tiger stripes...

Are you feeling fierce?

The salesman makes a playful paw swipe with his hand.

EASILY-EXCITABLE CUSTOMER

Oh, how fun!

RYAN

Excuse me--

OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN

I'm sorry, sir, I'm with a customer

now.

(MORE)

39.

OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN (CONT'D)

(indicates a number

dispenser)

But if you take a number, someone

will be with you shortly.

Ryan glances at the dispenser. A BIG YELLOW SMILEY FACE with

tickets ejected from the mouth. The next ticket it offers is

"#97"...and the Now-Serving Display on the wall reads "#71".

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!I

Just then, a BUSY SALESWOMAN walks by.     Ryan grabs her.

RYAN

Hey! Hey!      I've got an emergency

here --

BUSY SALESWOMAN

Sorry, I'm on break--

RYAN

Damn it, will you listen to me?!

I've got a life and death call on

this phone and my battery's dying!

Do you have a charger?

BUSY SALESMAN

Sure.

(walks away)

Take a number and one of the sales

associates will grab you one when

your turn comes up.

RYAN

Bu t-- !

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!

Ryan breaks out in a cold sweat. Can't catch his breath. As

a SALESWOMAN rushes by, Ryan reaches for her.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Help, I --

SALESWOMAN

Take a number.

The room starts spinning around him. It's clear no one's

going to help him. Like the clap of doom, the NOW-SERVING

DISPLAY on the wall flips happily to "#72"

SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!

Frantic, Ryan glances at the phone. And just as the last

BATTERY BAR on the power indicator FLICKERS and DISAPPEARS --

RYAN

Aw, screw this...

-- Ryan pulls the rent-a-cop's big .38 SPECIAL from his

pocket and BLOWS THE SMILEY FACE DISPENSER TO DUST!

40.

Instantly, people hit the dirt.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Oh look! Now serving thirty eight

special!

(beat)

NOW WHO'S GONNA GET ME THAT GODDAMN

CHARGER?

CUT TO:

\

Mooney exits the mayhem of the s   tation and walks to a SQUAD

CAR. Gets in. As he pulls his      seatbelt on, something

CRINKLES in his breast pocket.     He pulls it out -- the SCRAP

OF PAPER where the scribbled the    words "JESSICA MARTIN" and

"BRENTWOOD" when Ryan handed him    the phone.

Mooney crumples the paper and is about to throw it away...but

stops himself. He stares at the words, then unable to let it

go, punches keys on the MOBILE DATA TERMINAL. A name and

address appear on the screen:

JESSICA KATE MARTIN.   327 ELMWOOD ESTATES, BRENTWOOD.

Mooney stares at the name. Then, after a moment, he sighs

and pulls a LA LAKERS cellphone from his coat. Dials.

MOONEY

Hi, honey. Yeah, I'm gonna be a

few minutes late...

And as Mooney closes the door and starts up the engine--

CUT TO:

We PAN PAST PHOTOGRAPHS of Jessica's family over to-

AN ANSWERING MACHINE RINGS... ANSWERS.    We hear Jessica's

outgoing message, then a BEEP and-

MALE VOICE

(over machine)

Jessica? Damn, where are you?

(beat)

I called earlier and... Jess, I'm

in serious trouble. I can't explain

right now, but we're all in danger.

Please, just grab Ricky and meet me

in left field.

PAN UP to an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN listening to the machine.

CUT TO:

41.

Just as the phone literally dies -- Ryan rips a new CHARGER

from its packaging, slaps it into the phone and voila, it

begins CHARGING.

RYAN

Whew!   That was so no bueno!

JESSICA (VO)

You found a charger?

RYAN

Among other things...

Ryan glances at piles of phone gear he's appropriated from

Verizon. EARBUD MIKES. MANUALS. RECEPTION BOOSTERS.

Ryan fiddles with the now war-torn phone.

JESSICA

Thank you for doing all this,

Johnny.

RYAN

Yeah, look, about that...

(awkward beat)

My-name isn't really Johnny

Fountain.

JESSICA

Good, it sounded like a porn star

name.

(then softly)

It's okay. I know. You don't have

to tell me --

RYAN

It's Ryan. Ryan Ackerman. I'm a

bar-back. I'm twenty-two, and just

a little freaked out right now.

Jessica is moved with emotion by his honesty.

JESSICA

Thank you, Ryan.

But before they can say any more, suddenly--

SFX: FEET ON THE STAIRS - COMING TOWARD THE ATTIC!

Jessica JUMPS with a start. Tries to push the PHONE GUTS

behind a beam with her foot as Greer enters -- but fails.

The receiver sits in front of the beam, EXPOSED!

Greer crosses the room and sits on a box next to Jessica.    He

stares at her for long, uncomfortable moments. Then:

42.

GREEK

Do you want to die here?

Jessica drains white -- Does he see the phone?!

CUT BACK TO:

Slams on the brakes and skids up to the curb.      Covers the

mouthpiece.

RYAN

Oh shit!

Greer's question still hangs in the air.

JESSICA

N-no...

Jessica scoots away, trying to draw Greer's eyes in another

direction from the phone that lies OUT IN THE OPEN.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

...but I am going to, aren't I?

GREER

Up to you. Your husband left a

message asking you to meet him in

left field. Where's that?

JESSICA

What?   I don't understand--?

Greer winds up and BAM! Hits Jessica in the stomach, knocking

the wind out of her and causing her to fall to the ground.

GREER

--A base ball field !? Wh ich o ne

does he mean?!

JESSICA

(choking out the words)

I... I don't know what you want me

to say. I swear--

GREER

Shut up!!! Which field?! He

wouldn't leave a message that

didn't make sense to you!

Greer tightens his fist and is about to hit Jessica again--

JESSICA

Wait! The bleachers behind left

field at Dodger Stadium! That's

where we first met.

43.

Greer stares at Jessica for a long uncomfortable moment,

searching her soul. She's lying.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

Please! Believe me. That has to

be where he means. I swear to God.

Then he stands, looking away for just a moment -- but long

enough for Jessica to NUDGE the phone back behind the beam!

GREER

Working in my profession as long as

I have, you begin to recognize the

truth when you hear it.

Jessica, trembling, hangs on Greer's every word.

GREER (CONT'D)

(turning back)

Go to the window, Jessica. There's

something I want you to see.

Relieved at hiding the phone, Jessica gets up and moves to

the attic window -- and GASPS.

Down in the yard below, Jessica's eleven-year-old son Ricky

stands uncomfortably in the middle of a basketball half-court

as one of the kidnappers (a severe-looking ex-con named

HODGES) stands nearby, watching.

Jessica's knees nearly buckle.

JESSICA

Ricky!

Hodges looks up and sees Jessica's face in the window.   Then

turns and tosses a basketball to Ricky.

HODGES

Shoot hoops.

RICKY

I..   I don't feel like it.

HODGES

(threatening)

Shoot.

Nervously, Ricky begins to bounce the ball.

Jessica sees her son start shooting the ball -- completely

oblivious to Hodges, who flicks open his coat, revealing

SILENCED PISTOL tucked into his waistband.

44.

GREEK

You have three seconds to tell me

where he really is or you're going

to a funeral.

CUT TO:

Ryan's listening.     Helpless.   There's nothing he can do.

RYAN

Oh Jesus!    Oh Jesus!!

Jessica drains ghost-white. On the verge of passing out.

Down below, Ricky shoots baskets, unaware of Hodges closing

his hand around his gun.

GREER

One.. .

JESSICA

Please!     Please, believe me!

Ricky plays innocently -- while Hodges now COCKS his pistol.

GREER

Two.

Frantic, Jessica locks eyes with Hodges, silently pleading

for him not to do this. Hodges stares back with glacial ice.

JESSICA

(sobbing uncontrollably)

Please, he's just a child!

CUT TO:

Ryan is more frenzied than Jessica.

RYAN

(to himself)

Goddamn it, listen to her!     She

doesn't know!!

Ricky backs up to retrieve a high rebound. Jessica watches

in horror as Hodges begins to slowly DRAW HIS GUN.

JESSICA

No...no.'    I swear that's all I

know!

Greer gives a sigh of disbelief --

45 .

GREEK

Thre--

JESSICA

OKAY! ... okay...

(breaking down)

LAX Airport! There's a bar called

Left Field. That's where we met.

We were in college on our way to

Mardi-gras.

CUT TO:

Ryan's completely floored by Jessica's admission.     She knew

all along?

JESSICA

Please God, I swear that's the

truth. Don't kill my son!

GREER

(looking impressed)

Most people don't get past two.

Greer signals, and:

Hodges tucks his gun away...just as Ricky turns around.     The

kid startles that Hodges was so close.

HODGES

Okay, kid.     Let's go.

Jessica watches as her son is led away to the GUEST HOUSE

across the yard. Once he's inside and out of view, Jessica

collapses in a heap on the floor.

Greer is about to exit the attic -- when Jessica speaks.

JESSICA

You won't get away with this.

When I didn't show up at the

hospital, someone must have called

the police--

GREER

The police are the last people on

earth I'm worried about...

Greer pulls a Police Scanner out of his jacket and shows it

to Jessica.

MATCH CUT TO:

46.

listening to the call with every fiber of his being.

GREER (VO)

We get one hit on the scanner about

you, we'll be picking out family

plots, comprende?

Suddenly, a HUMMER, with the BASS THUMPING at ear-shattering

decibels, pulls alongside Ryan's car. DMX.

RAP TUNE

"SOME NIGGAS THAT YOU DON'T WANNA

TRY, (MY NIGGAS) SOME NIGGAS JUST

ABOUT DO OR DIE (MY NIGGAS) ..."

CUT TO:

Jessica hears it first. The pumping cacophony coming from

the phone behind the beam. It's subtle at first, but grows

increasingly louder. She closes her eyes, praying Greer

won't hear it--

But Greer does hear it. On the verge of leaving the room,

Greer stops. Cocks an ear. Instantly, Jessica tries to

cover it with her own voice.

JESSICA

Do you honestly expect me to

believe we're going to walk away

from this alive?

But Greer isn't listening to her. He strides back into the

room, listening to the noise under her voice.

GREER

(to Jessica)

Shut up.

Oblivious of Jessica desperately trying to clue him in.

JESSICA (VO)

How can I SHUT UP? You threaten to

kill my child and you expect me to

act like a MUTE?! If this --

Suddenly, it hits Ryan like a punch to the face.     And he

scrambles, trying to cover the phone.

RYAN

Oh shit!   Where's mute?!

ESSICA

...your child, then--

47 .

BLAMM!! -- Greer shoots a hole in the wall next to Jessica's

head. Afraid, she shuts her mouth... and prays.

BUT AT EXACTLY THE SAME MOMENT --

Ryan finds the MUTE BUTTON.      Presses it and--

Greer listens intently... and HEARS NOTHING but silence in

the still attic. Soon, he turns to leave. Only when he's

gone does Jessica's heart start beating again.

CUT TO:

The HUMMER finally pulls away.

RAP TUNE

"(MY NIGGAS) IF THEY COULD (MY

NIGGAS) they would (my niggas)...

As the thumping bass subsides, Ryan sighs with relief.

CUT TO:

Deason and Ellis wait for Greer, who enters, pulling off his

mask.

ELLIS

Well?

GREER

The Left Field sports bar at LAX.

ELLIS

Are you positive?

Greer ignores him.    Then turns to Deason.

GREER

Tell Hodges we move in ten.

Deason nods and moves off.

CUT BACK TO:

Jessica lies on the floor, sobbing into her knees.

Soft as an insect's buzz, we can hear Ryan calling to her on

the broken phone.

48.

RYAN (VO)

Jessica...? Answer me, goddamn it I

Soon, his voice pierces the suffocating gloom around her and

she crawls desperately over to it.

MATCH CUT TO:

Ryan's freaking out.

JESSICA (VO)

I'm here.

RYAN

You all right?!     I thought they--

JESSICA (VO)

I'm okay.

RYAN

What are you doing?    Why'd you lie

to them?

JESSICA

(welling up with tears)

Do you think I like gambling with

my son's life?

RYAN

I can't tell. You seem pretty good

at it --

JESSICA

Don't you see, Ryan? Once they get

Craig, we're all gonna die.

RYAN

You can't know that for sure.

JESSICA

Be realistic. Does letting us live

benefit them in any way? No! The

only chance he's got is if you can

get to the airport and find him

before they do.

RYAN

Wait, wait--!

JESSICA

Ryan, please! There's no time!

Just get to the airport--

RYAN

It's suicide. They'll kill me!

49.

J...      JESSICA

They won't! You're invisible to

them! They don't know who you are.

They don't know anything about you.

Please! You've got to try!

RYAN

Lady, I've jacked two cars, been

accused of being a child molester,

obliterated a car dealership, and

busted three caps in a Verizon

store. -- Don't tell me I'm not

trying!

Jessica tries another tack.

JESSICA

Look, I have no right to ask you

this Ryan, but you re my family's

only chance...and I am asking.

Something in the way she says that last sentence, a mixture

of strength and vulnerability, gets through to Ryan.

And against his own will, he's swayed.

RYAN

(gives in)

I'll get the phone to your husband,

but that's gotta be it, okay?!

*

Ryan, heading toward the airport, floors the gas.

CUT TO:

A PATROL CAR prowls down a quaint residential block. Comes

to a stop in the driveway of what we know to be Jessica

Martin's house. Mooney gets out. Knocks.

The door opens, revealing the ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN from

before.

MOONEY

Ms. Martin?

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

Yes?

MOONEY

Jessica Kate Martin?

The Woman nods. Mooney is plainly disillusioned by the

woman. Maybe his hunch was wrong...

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

Cam I help you, Officer...?

She scans Mooney's badge.

50.

MOONEY

Mooney.

(shakes his head)

No. No, I guess not. Must've been

a prank. I m sorry to have

b9thered you, Ms. Martin. Have a

nice day.

The Woman smiles and nods, and Mooney walks off. When he

gets to his car, he CRUMPLES the paper with Jessica's name

and address, and shakes his head, chuckling at himself.

As Mooney drives off--

THE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

walks back into the house and flips open her CELLPHONE. When

she finishes dialing, a familiar DEEP MALE VOICE answers.

DEEP MALE VOICE (VO)

Hello?

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

It's Bayback. Remember the Fusco

brothers?

Silence.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (CONT'D)

Well, I've got an itch that needs

scatching.

MATCH CUT TO:

ECU - THE MAN ON THE OTHER END OF THE CALL

Too close to make out who it is just yet--

DEEP MALE VOICE

What's the problem?

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)

We're in the middle of a shit

storm, and I need you to put a

leash put on an officer.

DEEP MALE VOICE

Who?

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)

An Officer Mooney from your

division. Know him?

Now, we start PULLING BACK, revealing the man's features.

DEEP MALE VOICE

Mooney? He's a desk sergeant.      What

would you want with him?

51.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)

I had to do a B & E and he came

snooping around the house looking

for the owner.

DEEP MALE VOICE

And what did you say?

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)

That I was her, of course.

Continue PULLING BACK.   We can almost recognize him now...

DEEP MALE VOICE

Did he believe you?

ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN   (VO)

I think so. He said he thought

someone was pulling a prank on him.

DEEP MALE VOICE

Mooney doing an investigation?

What's are you really up to?

The man swivels around in his chair and we see clearly it's--

DETECTIVE TOMLIN

And no bullshit. Right now you're

entire department's hot, so if I'm

gonna get in the tub, I've got to

know how deep it is.

CUT TO:

Ryan drives like madman toward the airport, blowing through

lights. Jessica is frantic.

JESSICA (VO)

Where are you now?!

RYAN

I'll be at the airport in twenty

minu --

JESSICA (VO)

Twenty minutes! Oh my God, Ryan,

you've got to drive faster! Please--

RYAN

(snapping)

Jessica, this car has a sewing

machine for an engine! I can't go

any faster!

JESSICA

Sorry.   I just...

52.

Jessica's voice trails off as she catches a glimp se of

herself in an OLD MIRROR standing in the corner.  Bruised.

Clothes torn. Staring at her own cracked reflect  ion, she

breaks down, but silently this time, locked in he r own

personal hell.

For Ryan, the silence is deafening. Despite his frantic

driving, he feels her pain. And hates being unable to help.

RYAN

Jessica... ?

There's an emotional beat, then--

JESSICA

Do you think God will forgive me?

RYAN

What do you mean--?

JESSICA

For what I've done...   For giving

up Craig...

Ryan is moved by the emotion in her voice.

RYAN

Jessica, they have your kid. You

had no choice.

JESSICA

I don't know. I don't know...

RYAN

1 know. I heard what they were

doing to you over there. You held

out for as long as you could.

JESSICA

(grim beat)

My son and I are going to die here,

Ryan. They already have us. But

maybe I could've saved Craig...

The truth of this has a profound effect on Ryan. And just

when Jessica is about to lose herself to despair --

Ryan finds a resolve within himself even he didn't know he

had.

RYAN

Jessica, listen to me. I promise

you, I'm not going to let that

happen. I could care less about

your money. I'm risking my life

cause I know I'm gonna get you and

your family out of this. You hear

what I'm sayin'?

53.

There is a moment between them, two people connecting on a

human level...

But the moment is suddenly cut short as a STATICKY VOICE

start bleeding into their phone call -- some BRITISH ASSHOLE

having his own phone call.

BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)

-- Yeah, the show just bought me a

Cadillac XLR convertible. No, you

can't ride in it. Not until you do

something with that road kill you

call hair. And what's with your

makeup? Kabuki Theatre is not in

style --

RYAN

(interrupting)

Jessica? Are you still there?

BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)

Hey, hey?!    This is a private call!

Jessica's voice starts fading as the CROSSTALK gets worse.

JESSICA (VO)

(washed in static)

I'm..ere, but y...reaking up!

BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)

Get off my line! Are you there?

Mom? I

RYAN

Listen dude, this woman's in

serious --

BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)

--That's not my problem, lady.

Lady?! Suddenly, STATIC starts drowning out Ryan's side of

the call.

RYAN

(yelling over the static)

Jessica, don't hang up! You hear

me?! Whatever happens --

BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)

Look woman, tell your kidnapping

story to someone who gives a shit.

Ryan can't hear Jessica's side of the conversation; only the

British Asshole's, which comes in loud and clear.

RYAN

Jessica?!     Jessica?!

As Ryan goes mental, a CAR PASSES HIM on the opp9site side of

the road -- a new Cadillac XLR convertible! Inside is an

appropriately asshole-ish looking guy. He could only be the

British Asshole.

,

54.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Gotcha.

Ryan pulls a HARROWING 180 DEGREE TURN, barely missing an

oncoming car by inches.

He RACES up to the Cadillac, which has a VANITY PLATE that

reads, "IDOL MKR." Ryan looks through the window at --

CUT TO:

The driver, who in a typical LA celebrity sighting, turns out

to be none other than SIMON COWELL, host of American Idol.

Simon continues his spittle-spraying rant -- at no one.      It

appears he's using the car's SPEAKERPHONE.

CUT BACK TO:

Ryan eyes Simon's mouth while hearing:

SIMON COWELL (VO)

(over Ryan's cellphone)

Murdered your housekeeper? Don't

bullshit me; I work in the Industry

that invented it you stupid COW!

Ryan sees Simon Cowell MOUTH THE WORDS "STUPID COW" in synch

with the conversation. BINGO!

Ryan floors the Rent-a-cop car ahead of the Cadillac and

PULLS A 90 DEGREE turn at an intersection; cutting Cowell

off!

SCREEEECH! Cowell, trying to avoid a collision, SLAMS on the

brakes, causing the Cadillac to SKID twenty feet.

Ryan jumps out of the rent-a-cop car he's left in the middle

or the intersection and runs over to the Cadillac, banging on

the window with the .38 Special.

Cowell practically jumps out of his skin at the sight of the

gun and the kid with the crazy look in his eyes.

SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)

BLOODY HELL!!

RYAN

Give me that phone... or I shoot

your car!

Cowell is prepared to comply -- but suddenly behind them--

SFX:   HONK-HONK!!

55 .

-- Ryan notices a 10-TON SEMI heading straight for the Rent-a-

cop car too late. The DRIVER SLAMS his brakes, but --

KABLLAAAAMMM!

EXPLODES into tiny pieces of junk as the semi PLOUGHS THROUGH

IT! Flaming debris rains down around Ryan, and he covers his

mouth, unable to believe his shitty luck.

RYAN

Ain't that a bitch!

Ryan turns back to Simon Cowell.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Out of the car! Now!

Cowell all but dives out.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Where's your phone?!

SIMON COWELL

It's on speaker!

Ryan turns to the car.    Calls out.

RYAN

Jessica?

JESSICA (VO)

Ryan?!    I'm here!

Her voice says she can't believe her ears.

Relieved, Ryan jumps in the Cadillac XLR and tosses his phone

on the passenger seat, next to a LAPTOP computer. Guns the

engine and STOMPS the gas.

As he passes the ruins of his rent-a-cop car, he slows just

enough to open the Cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of

Verizon goodies laying on the pavement -- then peels away.

Practically frothing at the mouth, Simon Cowell chases after

on foot, cursing as his beautiful new Cadillac disappears in

the distance --

SIMON COWELL

Your career's over!    YOU HEAR ME?!

OVER!

As Jessica's voice RESOUNDS around him, he notices the

phone's controlled through the radio. He turns it up.

JESSICA (VO)

(still shaken)

I thought they... I thought I was--

56.

85                                                                     85

RYAN

You're okay. It's okay now.

DISSOLVE TO:

86   EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - ESTABLISHING                              86

Along with the million other cars, FIND the Cadillac

87   INT. CADILLAC XLR - AIRPORT                                       87

Ryan tries to avoid eye contact with the TRAFFIC COP

assisting the flow of cars.

RYAN (INTO PHONE)

I'm here... Oh shit!

SCREEEECH! Ryan steps on the brakes, seeing something ahead.

WHIP PAN AROUND to see what Ryan's staring at. Just ahead,

JESSICA'S ESCALADE is pulling up to the curb.

JESSICA (VO)

What?

RYAN

Your car's here.

Ryan pulls along side the red curb and watches as four tough-

looking men exit the vehicle. We recognize them as Greer,

Deason, Ellis and Hodges.

JESSICA (VO)

Hurry, Ryan! Just find Craig!

Ryan hops out -- but stops when the car CALLS OUT TO HIM.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

Wait, Ryan! What about me--?!

Ryan searches the car and finds the HANDSET in the armrest.

As he grabs it and races after Greer into the airport, a

Traffic Cop comes up to the car.

TRAFFIC COP

HEY, YOU CAN'T PARK HERE!!

But it's too late.   Ryan's already gone.

88   INT. LAX AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS                                     88

Greer and his men stride through the airport like sharks

honing in on bleeding prey.

Soon, the Kidnappers break up into two groups: Greer and

Ellis heading for the DEPARTURE GATES; Deason and Hodges go

the other way towards the INFORMATION KIOSK.

Ryan heads toward the --

57.

Greer, who waits in the LINE OF PASSENGERS waiting to pass

through airport's METAL DETECTORS. This is Ryan's chance.

He cuts through the line.

RYAN

Oops. Excuse me. Pardon me. My

grandmother needs her walker...

Soon, he makes his way to the front, right behind Greer and

BUMPS into him. As he does, NOTICE --

ECU of Ryan slyly slipping the rent-a-cop's tiny .38 Special

into Greer's heavy motorcycle jacket.

Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there.

Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that

we're afraid he's going to notice Ryan, who now stands

innocently the next line over--

--but Greer's eyes pass right over him as he scans the crowd.

Ryan breathes a sigh of relief as Greer finally turns away to

walk through the metal detector and...

SFX:   BZZZZZZZTTH

...sets off the alarm.

DETECTOR OPERATOR

Excuse me, sir. Would you mind

emptying your pockets over here?

Confused, Greer does. He lays his wallet on the table, then

his keys... Then looks baffled as he pulls out -- the GUN 1

DETECTOR OPERATOR (CONT'D)

Code red!     Code red!

The response she gets is stunning. SECURITY GUARDS jump out

of the woodwork with guns drawn. ALARMS go off. SECURITY

GATES start coming down. Travelers start SCREAMING and

PANICKING!

SECURITY GUARDS

GET DOWN!    GET ON THE GROUND!!

ELLIS

(reaching for something)

Wait, this is a mistake--

TENSE GUARD

HANDS/     HANDS!!

As one, the entire security force POUNCES on Greer and Ellis,

TACKLING them to the ground and IMMOBILIZING their limbs.

58.

And while that chaos is going on, Ryan slowly backs through

to the metal detector...and starts running for Left Field.

MATCH CUT TO:

GREER AND ELLIS are crushed under the dogpile of security.

Behind them, a door slams open and a formation of NATIONAL

GUARDSMEN race on-scene, showing just how seriously security

is taken in the wake of Sept. 11th.

CUT TO:

Ryan jogs down the concourse when--

PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM

Attention travelers. Due to a

security problem, all persons are

required to clear the terminal and

return immediately to the security

checkpoint at the entrance to

Concourse B...

At once, everyone begins filing out of the terminal. Ryan

looks like a salmon swimming upstream, the only figure moving

against the tide of people rushing to get out.

JESSICA (VO)

"Left Field" is in Terminal C.

RYAN

Listen to me! They're clearing the

terminal. Before your husband passes

me, what does he look like?

JESSICA (VO)

He's thirty-eight. Six feet.     Trim

build. Thinning hair...

RYAN

(scanning the passengers)

That's not enough! What's he

wearing?

JESSICA (VO)

I don't know! We have completely

different schedules. I was fast

aslee p--

(thinking it through)

-- A suit... He wears glasses,

thick rims, like Buddy Holly or--

Bingo! The Buddy Holly glasses is what did it. Ryan sees a

man in the distance hurrying in his direction -- CRAIG.

RYAN

Found him!

59.

And just as Ryan bee-lines it towards Craig--

VOICE (OS)

Excuse me, sir--

Ryan turns and finds a NATIONAL GUARDSMAN right behind him.

NATIONAL GUARDSMAN

You can't be here now. You have to

leave the area.

RYAN

But --

NATIONAL GUARDSMAN

Now, sir.

And as Ryan is marched away he sees--

CUT TO:

Knees in their necks.    Hands covering their faces.

GREER

A YOUNG GUARDSMAN does -- and in a big reveal, we see that he

WITHDRAWS A BADGE. A Los Angeles policeman's badge...

Ryan's jaw drops.      He can't believe it -- they're cops?!

YOUNG GUARDSMAN

Hey, this one's on the job.

RYAN

Holy shit, Jessica, these guys are

cops!

JESSICA (VO)

What?!

The Guardsman's SUPERIOR OFFICER examines it.      Is it real?

SUPERIOR OFFICER

Run it.

(the Guardsman runs off;

turns back to Greer)

Is that your gun?

GREER

(hesitates)

--yes. Yes. It's my piece.

SUPERIOR OFFICER

Well, you're supposed to declare it.

60.

GREEK

I know. We just got focused on a

rabbit we're here to nab.

Just then, the Young Guardsman returns.

YOUNG GUARDSMAN

He's clean. Badge matches his I.D.

SUPERIOR OFFICER

(grumbles)

Unhook 'em. Stand down security.

MATCH CUT TO:

Ryan looks relieved when the airport's alarms SHUT OFF._ The

P.A. system cheerily thanks everyone for their cooperation

and, all around, security gates begin to rise.

RYAN

(noticing; to Guard)

Hey, can I go now? Can I go?!

The Guard nods, and Ryan takes off like a shot, racing back

towards the bar.

Ryan spots Craig Martin outside the Left Field sports bar.

Ryan grabs him by the elbow and starts hustling him through

the concourse.

CRAIG

Hey, what the hell?!    Get your

hands off m--!!

RYAN

Shut up and keep walking. If they

see us they'll kill us both.

CRAIG

What--?

RYAN

Your wife sent me.

CRAIG

She did?   But how--?

RYAN

Would you hurry your ass?! You

need to hide. They're here, and

they're looking for you. They

already have your family.

Craig looks at him, growing terrified.

RYAN (CONT'D)

In here!

61.

Ryan pulls Craig into the MENS RESTROOM.

CUT TO:

CRAIG

I don't understand--

RYAN

It's okay. She'll explain it to you.

(into phone)

Okay, Jessica, I'm handing you over now.

CUT TO:

Relief can be traced on Jessica's face.

JESSICA

(welling up)

Ryan, you've done so much.     I don't

know how to repay you...

An awkward, emotional pause falls between them.

RYAN

Forget about the cash. Just get you

and y9ur son home safely and we'll

call it even.

JESSICA

I will.   I promise.

RYAN (VO)

I know you will.

RYAN hands the cellphone over to Craig.

RYAN (CONT'D)

I'm gonna be outside this door.

Don't come out unless I get you.

Got it?

CRAIG

(confused)

Okay.

Ryan walks out the restroom door as Craig puts the phone to

his ear. He sighs with relief -- it's finally over.

CUT TO:

GREER and ELLIS stride toward the bar.

62.

ELLIS

(sotto voce)

Nice move. What the hell you bring

a gun for?

GREEK

I didn't.

ELLIS

(sounding nervous)

What do you mean?

GREER

Just keep your eyes open!

Something weird is going on.

Greer stares daggers at everyone he passes.

Ellis Io9ks around before glancing down at a PHOTO COPY of a

California driver's license.

CUT BACK TO:

Trying to act inconspicuous, Ryan guards the entrance to the

Men's Room. He's starts to check out a magazine rack at an

adjacent concession stand when he hears:

CRAIG

HEY, RYAN?    RYAN!

Ryan turns. RACK FOCUS past Ryan to Craig standing fifty

feet back, holding the phone out.

CRAIG (CONT'D)

This isn't my wife.

ECU ON RYAN'S FACE

As it sinks in.   Disbelief.    Anger.   Dread.

CRAIG (CONT'D)

My wife's name is Patty. I'm not

Craig. I'm Paul. Paul Boyd.

In utter disbelief, Ryan turns back toward the gate -- and

sees Greer, Ellis, Hodges and Deason, cornering another MAN.

Tall. Lean. Thinning hair.

And wearing Buddy Holly glasses.    The real CRAIG MARTIN.

RYAN

Shit!

MATCH CUT TO:

Greer seizes Craig by the arm.

63.

GREEK

Make a scene and you'll never see

your family again. Now who's here

with you?

Craig's eyes swell with fear.

CRAIG

Who, what?... No one!   Nobody!

GREER

Answer me!

Greer looks around the crowded airport.

CRAIG

I'll forget I saw anything, just

leave them alone!

Whatever.    Greer manhandles Craig toward the exit.

GREER

For your family's sake, you better

not have done anything stupid.

RYAN snatches the phone from the bogus Craig Martin -- and

hauls ass through a sea of travelers, trying to catch up to --

GREER AND ELLIS

who scan the crowd bulling their way through throngs of

people, leading Craig Martin between them.

BUT RYAN

Has more difficulty. Gets STALLED and SWEPT AWAY in the

crowd long enough for the kidnappers to make it outside--

To their car. Craig is forced into the ESCALADE between

Greer and Ellis.

CRAIG

You goddamn animals better not have

hu rt --

Greer surprises him with a vicious ELBOW to the face.

GREER

Animals?

Ellis whips a burlap hood over Craig's head and they drive

off just as--

CUT TO:

65.

102                                                                       102

MARILYN

Yes. He said you looked distracted

when you left. He wants you to

relax, Bob. He said they found

that kid you were looking for and

that you were right, it was all a

prank. Nothing to worry about.

MOONEY

Yeah, I know.

She pulls him back down for another kiss.

MARILYN

What am I gonna do with you?

MOONEY

You're gonna dance with me all

night long, until we're too pooped

to pop... Well almost.

A giggle.    They kiss.

MARILYN

You'll never change.

MOONEY

Yes I will, after I shower.

They both share a laugh.

MARILYN

Lame ass.   Come on.

She pushes herself down the hallway and he follows.

CUT TO:

As it pulls off the road onto the driveway of the kidnappers

safe house and parks. Craig still wears the hood as Greer

exits the car.

GREER

Get out!

As Craig reaches blindly for a door handle, Ellis opens the

door and shoves him out onto the driveway. Greer yanks him

up by his collar.

GREER (CONT'D)

GET UP!    WALK!

With guns at his back, Craig is dragged inside the house.

p

The darkness is oppressive.       Craig is pushed inside and pulls

the hood off.

66.

CRAIG

Goddamn it, what the hell are you

people going to--

JESSICA (OS)

Craig?

Craig stops dead, hearing the voice. Scans the cobweb-filled

room, seeing nothing -- then from the depths of the shadows,

Jessica materializes looking haunted and lifeless as a ghost.

CRAIG

Jessica?

Jessica races for the safety of Craig's arms, but just as

she's about to be embraced, Greer steps forward and YANKS

Jessica back by her hair. She squeals in pain.

CRAIG (CONT'D)

HEY --/ /

Craig moves to object, but -- OOF! -- Deason sends him

gasping to the floor with a sledgehammer fist to the gut.

JESSICA

No, don't hurt him!

Jessica struggles and, with an annoyed shove, Greer sends her

spilling into Craig. She hugs tightly against him.

When Craig gets his wind back, he comes to his knees and

manages to croak out--

CRAIG

Ricky...?

Jessica nods gravely. He's here, too. Craig looks at his

wife's face, bruised and hurt, and tears rise in his eyes.

CRAIG (CONT'D)

Oh, God, Jess... What have they

done to you?

But Jessica won't let this moment be about pity.

JESSICA

Who are they, Craig?

Craig doesn't know what to say.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

Tell them, Craig. Tell them they

have the wrong family. Tell them

they've made a mistake--

But something in his eyes disagrees.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

What?!      What is it?

67.

.u          CRAIG

This isn't a mistake, Jess.

And that's all it takes for Jessica's world to shatter.

GREEK emerges from the shadows, startling them, and backhands

Craig's jaw with the butt of his gun.

GREEK

Where is the disc now?

Blood trickles from the corner of Craig's mouth.

CRAIG

You have to promise. If I give it

to you... you'll let my family go.

GREER

I'll tell you what, you tell me

where it is--

(turns his gun on Jessica)

--and I won't blow her brains all

over you right now.

Greer traces the barrel of the gun down Jessica's cheek.

Craig looks utterly helpless.

GREEK (CONT'D)

Your call Craig. It's an eighty-five

''cent bullet to me.

.

Greer lowers the gun to her neckline( pulls her shirt

lower... She pleads "no" at Craig with her eyes, but he

finally breaks.

CRAIG

Okay. Enough, you win.      But if

anything-

GREER

(training gun on Craig)

Just shut up and talk.

MATCH CUT TO:

Ryan rides back into the city in a cab.

He listens some more, then covers the phone's mouthpiece and

taps the CABBIE on the shoulder.

CRAIG (V.O.)

I dropped it down the mail chute at

work. It's gotta be in the

mailroom.

JESSICA (VO)

(for Ryan's benefit,

weakly)

You hid it downtown?

68 .

RYAN

Change of plans.      I need to get to

downtown fast.

MATCH BACK TO:

Greer pulls Craig to his feet.

GREEK

Get up.     We're going.

CRAIG

How will I know she's okay?

HODGES

(shoving him)

Move!

When he gets near the door, Jessica is overcome with emotion

and races to her husband.

JESSICA

Wait!   WAIT!!

She brushes past Hodges and hugs on tight to her husband,

tears flowing from her eyes.

Hodges goes to pull them apart, but Greer stops him.        He

knows this is going to be their last time together.

CRAIG

I love you.

Craig squeezes the good years of their marriage into a

strong, loving embrace. Jessica hugs him closer. Leans into

his ear to seemingly whisper her love in return -- but what

she actually whispers takes Craig by surprise.

JESSICA

(quickly; sotto voce)

Pretend I'm telling you that I love

you. There's an open phone line in

here. You'll have help at the

office, but if you give these men

what they want, we're dead.

Jessica kisses her husband on the lips and withdraws, leaving

Craig with an utterly confused expression on his face. But

before his look can betray him--

GREER

Let's go.

--Greer and Hodges move forward, ushering Craig out of the

room. When the door locks behind them, Jessica once again

rushes to the phone.

69.

JESSICA

Ryan?! They're going to Fegan

Securities, 4th and Figuroa.

MATCH CUT TO:

Ryan, in the cab, weaves through cars.

RYAN (INTO PHONE)

I'm already on my--

Suddenly, the cab rounds a bend -- and grinds to a halt from

backed up traffic!

RYAN (CONT'D)

You've gotta be kidding me!

(to cabbie)

Can't you back it up?

The cabbie tries, but is hopelessly locked in by cars pulling

up behind him. Shrugs.

About a hundred yards up the road, Ryan sees the 4th

Street/Figuroa Exit. He's so close...

RYAN (CONT'D)

Aw, screw this!

Ryan throws some bills at the driver, hops out the passenger

side and starts RUNNING.

A short time later, Ryan( drenched in sweat, sees Craig's

office building in the distance --

With an all cement exterior (and few windows), it's a

cellphone user's nightmare.

As Ryan huffs and puffs toward the building, he sees a BIKE

MESSENGER bullshitting with a HOT DOG VENDOR. Ryan stops and

stares at the PACKAGE POUCH on the seat and a flashy red BIKE

HELMET hanging on the handlebars.

The helmet is futuristic, like something The Flash might

wear. Ryan eyes the Messenger, grabs the bike, hops on and

peddles for dear life toward Craig's building with the

Messenger hot on his heels.

As Ryan arrives at the building, the Escalade pulls up in

front of him and Greer, Hodges and Ellis file into the

building.

70.

Ryan skids to a stop.   Eyes the carrying pouch...

Ryan, carrying the carrying pouch and bike helmet, enters the

lobby. Greer and the others disappear into an ELEVATOR.

N9W inside, STATIC starts playing hell with their connection.

Fine in some areas, terrible in others.

JESSICA (V.O.)

Wait, we --(bzzt!)--ve to think!

What --(bzzt!)--re we going to do?

RYAN

I have an idea...

Ryan fights his way through the tourists to the elevator bay.

Quickly scans the DIRECTORY. Among the long list of CPAs,

there's a MAILROOM on the 3rd floor.

CUT TO:

Mooney (looking damn awkward in a suit and tie), lies on the

bed, watching the news.

In the background, Marilyn can be seen in the master

bathroom, sitting before the vanity mirror in her wheelchair.

She puts on makeup.

MARILYN

In five minutes, I'll need you to

give me a hand.

MOONEY

Whenever you're ready, hon.

Still wearing his holster, he shifts uncomfortably on the bed

as he watches the news.

NEWS ANCHOR

...and authorities are now asking

your help in identifying this man--

Mooney jolts upright as they display A FUZZY PHOTO OF RYAN

from the Verizon surveillance cameras.

NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D)

-- believed to be responsible for

today's bizarre string of crimes,

most notably the theft of an $80,000

Cadillac at gunpoint.

MOONEY

What..?

Mooney watches as they continue to detail Ryan's "wild crime

spree", but gets the bigger picture, realizing that every

event --the Verizon store; searching for the Martin kid;

71.

stealing the Cadillac -- centers around the cellphone call

Ryan tried to tell him about this morning.

Detective gears turning, Mooney reaches for the phone on the

bedside table. Dials 411.

OPERATOR

Thank you for using Pacbell. This

is Claire, how may I help you?

MOONEY

I need the phone number for a

residence. Jessica Martin in

Brentwood.

OPERATOR

That number is (310) 555-8364.    For

an extra seventy five cents-

Mooney hangs up, dials the number. The phone rings and

rings. Eventually, an answering machine picks up.

JESSICA'S VOICE  (VO)

Hi, you've reached the hom  e of

Craig and Jessica Martin.   We can't

get to the phone right now  , but if

you leave your name and a   message--

Mooney listens intently -- and is troubled.

MOONEY

(to an oblivious Marilyn)

The woman at the house didn't have

an accent.

Marilyn smiles, realizing he's really talking to himself.

Mooney hangs up, thoughts racing. He reaches behind him, and

without looking he grabs his wallet and keys.

He then walks over to Marilyn and kisses the top of her head.

She knows him, and knows something's up.

MOONEY (CONT'D)

I'm sorry honey( but I have to

check on something real quick.

MARILYN

You've got to be kidding-

MOONEY

Delay the reservation if you have

to; I'll be back in twenty minutes.

And Mooney's gone...

MARILYN

Twenty minutes my foot.

CUT TO:

72.

A few SECRETARIES get out on the second floor.

Alone with the others, Greer eyes the mysterious .38 Special.

GREER

(re: .38 Special)

Keep your eyes open.

CUT TO:

Dripping with sweat, Ryan shambles out of the stairwell, the

bike helmet now strapped to his head and the pouch over his

shoulder -- just as the ELEVATOR ARRIVES behind him!

As Greer, Hodges and Craig get out, Ryan turns and searches

for the mailroom that's supposed to be here! Where the hell

is-- Ah I He finds it and hustles into --

A wide COUNTER separates Ryan and a few BUSINESS MEN and

WOMEN from the MAIL CLERKS that busily work the other side.

Ryan leans against the wall, pretending to be an ordinary

bike messenger waiting for a package as Craig and the dirty

cops enter, brushing right past him.

Craig scans the faces of the other patrons as they enter,

desperately trying to figure out who is his secret ally. He

ignores Ryan completely, whose face is mostly hidden by the

tinted plastic VISOR attached to the helmet.

Craig notices an AGING SECURITY GUARD stationed in the area,

but knows better than to make any waves.

MAILROOM SUPERVISOR

(recognizing Craig)

Anything I can help you with Mr.

Martin?

CRAIG

Hey, Benny. This might sound

ridiculous, but I dropped a DVD

mailer into the chute this morning

and I forgot to put down an

address.

MAILROOM SUPERVISOR

Happens all the time. Let me see

what's back there. Gimme a sec'.

The Supervisor disappears into the back room.

Greer and Hodges take a seat only a few feet away from Ryan.

The moment is uncomfortable...and gets infinitely worse as--

73.

MAIL CLERK ,

Excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir?

Ryan turns, realizing with horror that another MAIL CLERK is

speaking to him.

RYAN

Me?

MAIL CLERK

You waiting for a package?

Now everyone's looking at Ryan.     Including Greer.

RYAN

(facing away)

Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick

something up for Mr. Fountain over

at the Bonaventure.

MAIL CLERK

From what department?

RYAN

I'm not sure... They said it was a

contract, though, I know that, so

what would that be, Legal?

MAIL CLERK

What's the tracking number?

RYAN

(patting himself down)

Uh... Right. Tracking number.

It's looking grim.   Thankfully, the Supervisor reappears.

MAILROOM SUPERVISOR

Mr. Martin? I found a number of

things that could be what you're

looking for. Mind coming back to

take a look?

Hodges shoots Craig a look, "go".

CRAIG

Sure.

The Supervisor leads Hodges and Craig away to the back room.

Unfortunately, Greer stays behind.

RYAN

(patting himself)

I might... Maybe it's on the

clipboard on my bike?

Ryan watches Greer out of the corner of his eye as Hodges and

Craig disappear inside the vault.

74.

RYAN (CONT'D)

I, uh, may need to call somebody.

CUT TO:

There's an entire shelf that serves as a dead letter office.

One plastic bin is filled with reusable interoffice

envelopes, another bin is overflowing with small mailers,

computer disks, unlabeled video tapes, Etc...

MAILROOM SUPERVISOR

Help yourself.

HODGES cautiously watches Craig shuffle through the mailers,

opening two or three before finding -- he turns one upside

down -- and a DVD case slides out!

A quick glance at the label, "ADT Digital Surveillance'.

5/19/05 06:00 - 07:00" confirms it's the disc.

CRAIG

This is it.

Hodges seems uncomfortable with the Supervisor hovering over

his shoulder.

HODGES

Let's go.

BACK TO:

Ryan now sits by the window, cellphone pressed to his ear.

Feigning frustration.

RYAN

You believe this? Everyone's got

their head up their ass over there.

The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to.

Greer opens his cellphone to make a call, but when the signal

is no good, he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window

at the end of the hall.

MAIL CLERK

(impatiently)

Sir? You think you could just go

outside and get your clipboard?

Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault.

MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)

Sir?

Ryan glances at Greer, momentarily distracted on the phone.

At Hodges, almost out of the bank. As he and Craig near the

door --

75.

A moment where Craig finally locks eyes with Ryan -- and

suddenly realizes: This is the guy!

It's now or never.   Ryan has to do something.

MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)

Sir!?

RYAN

(to Clerk)

Screw the package.

Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a

metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by--

MAIL CLERK

WHAT ARE YOU DOING--?!

-- swings it full-force into Hodges' face -- WHAMM!!   Hodges

drops like a slaughterhouse cow.

Instantly, employees hit the ground; scream; run for their

lives. Craig dives for the DVD case. The Security Guard has

come to life; drawing down on them.

SECURITY GUARD

FREEZE!

Craig does.   But Ryan grabs him and moves, racing out of the

bank.

"

RYAN

COME ON, LET'S GO!

At the end of the hall, GREER sees Craig and Ryan running out

of the mailroom. Drops his phone, draws his gun --

SECURITY GUARD (OS)

FREEZE!!

-- just as the Guard comes running out. His gun was fixed on

Ryan, but now that he sees Greer with a piece, he trains his

gun on him instead.

SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)

DROP YOUR WEAPON!

Ryan and Craig are struck in the middle of the crossfire.

GREER

(flashing his badge)

L.A.P.D.! I'M A COP!

SECURITY GUARD

DROP IT NOW!!

The instant Ryan and Craig try to escape into a nearby

stairwell -- Greer turns his gun on the SECURITY GUARD --

BANG! BANG!

76.

-The Security Guard drops and Greer aims his weapon at Craig

again!

BANG! -- Greer fires.

Craig, SHOT IN THE BACK, slams against Ryan with the impact.

They fall half-in/half-out of the stairwell. Craig weakly

shoves the DVD into Ryan's hands.

CRAIG

..run...

But Ryan is overwhelmed.       His legs feel like a thousand

pounds of jelly.

CRAIG (CONT'D)

..ruuuUUUUNNNNNN!!

As Craig slumps to the ground, Ryan stares in shock -- but

when Greer starts sending a hail of bullets toward them, he

DIVES into:

He starts flying down the stairs...but when he sees four

BUILDING SECURITY GUARDS racing up from below--

RYAN

Damn!

--he turns around and starts RUNNING UP instead.

Hodges gets to his feet. Stumbles out, holding his gushing,

broken nose. Yells at Greer, who's racing into the stairwell.

HODGES

The kid!!

GREER

No shit.

With the Guards and Greer only a floor behind, Ryan thinks

fast and CHUCKS HIS BIKE HELMET down the corridor, ELBOWS the

In-Case-Of-Emergency Glass, setting off the FIRE ALARM -- and

starts running UP.

Seconds later, when they reach that level, one of the Guards

sees Ryan's helmet and the broken glass leading away.

GUARD

(racing down the hall)

This way!

The other Guards follow...but Greer isn't convinced.       On a

hunch, he turns and continues running UP also.

Peeking over the edge from the floor above--

77 .

RYAN

Sees Greer and Hodges coming.     Big-ass guns out and ready.

Shit.'

THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM.     PEOPLE start filling the stairwell

on every floor.

Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs

until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves

open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof.

He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as--

GREER and HODGES reach the floor beneath. See the door

swinging shut -- but neither fall for the bait. They runs up

toward the-

Ryan's eyes SCAN the rooftop. Construction is in progress up

here; tarpapering. Huge ROLLS OF TARPAPER lie about,

PALATTES holding supplies covered with TARPS, an industrial

AIR CONDITIONER...

Ryan quickly shoves a 2"x4" under the doorknob to jam it.

Heart pounding, he races to the building's edge and looks

down. Nothing but a straight drop 60 feet down.

Footsteps are approaching! POUNDING on the door! Ryan darts

behind a tarp-covered mass of supplies just as --

GREER shakes the 2"x4" loose.     He and Hodges explode out onto

the roof, looking for Ryan.

Greer encircles the huge air-conditioner while Hodges hunts

behind a large SATELLITE DISH. No Ryan.

GREER

(to Hodges)

Here.

Cop-instincts crackling, Greer stands on one side of the tarp-

covered stockpile and waits for Hodges to secure the other.

This is it; they signal go at each other and spring around --

But Ryan's nowhere to be found!

GREER (CONT'D)

Dammit!

No, wait! Greer turns and sees a LARGE ALUMINUM CHUTE that

leads from the roof and elbows down toward a DUMPSTER on

ground level.

78.

Greer peers down the chute for long seconds...but nothing can

be seen from this angle. It all falls to blackness.

THE ALARM STOPS.

Greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence. The only

sounds are INCOHERENT SCREAMS coming from the stairwell. He

eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster, thinks...

REVEAL --

RYAN, wedging himself against the sides of the chute, tries

to be as still as possible. Every slight movement makes the

ALUMINUM BUCKLE AND GROAN.

From his shirt pocket, Jessica's tiny desperate voice pleads.

JESSICA (VO)

Ryan... ? Ryan, please answer me I

But Ryan just sits there.    Afraid to move.     Terrified to

discuss Craig.

Greer picks up a large roll of tarpaper and starts lugging it

toward the open mouth of the chute...

Ryan holds his breath.    Trembling.   His leg threatening to

rabbit-foot again.

Straining to hear Greer, it's impossible not to hear:

JESSICA

You have to talk to me! Ryan,

please you have to talk to me--.'

The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he

catches himself, there is a soft metallic BOOOONG from the

stressed metal.

Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls

the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear.

Desperate to console her, Ryan --

BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks

up to see it angrily launching itself right at him!

He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit.      He presses

himself to one side but --

WHAM!! The bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist -- and he DROPS

SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE!

79.

Ryan reaches out, but the phone goes sliding down the chute!

CUT TO:

Jessica hears a loud SCRAAAAPE, CRASH and a wash of STATIC.

JESSICA

Ryan?!    OH MY GOD, RYAN?!   RYAN--?!

The hulking Deason hears Jessica's PANICKED VOICE and stands

with a start. As he moves toward the attic, he notices a

small RED LIGHT FLASHING behind the bar. As he passes, he

checks it out and--

DEASON

WHAT THE--?!

WHIP PAN DOWN to what Deason sees: The red light is on one

of the house phones. The LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR.

And it's lit.

Shaking like a bear pissing pineapples, Deason rages away

toward the attic...

CUT TO:

Jessica is curling herself into a tiny sobbing ball on the

floor when -- WHAMM! -- the attic door crashes open. Jessica

jumps. Deason looms there. Sees the phone.

DEASON

YOU STUPID BITCH!

Jessica hurls the phone receiver away.

DEASON (CONT'D)

WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?! WHO HAVE YOU

TOLD?!

JESSICA

NO, DON 'T H URT M E--

Deason roars up and grabs Jessica's neck with one hand.

HURLS her across the attic and into the OLD MIRROR,

shattering it in a million pieces around her.

Desperate for anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she

struggles to her feet. A two-inch chip.

DEASON

YOU AND YOUR KID ARE DEAD!

She lowers her arm, defeated, out of breath...        You win.

80.

131                                                                     131

JESSICA

Don't hurt me, and I'll do

anything... Anything.. .

There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason

responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her

flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty

fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him.

Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins

to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted

as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she

flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper

arm.

Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs

as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--

DEASON

(sarcastic)

Oooh.

--but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason

looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt

sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto

the floor like a river.

Deason drains white; dizzy.      He looks at Jessica, confused.

JESSICA

Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30

liters of blood per minute...and

there's only five liters in the

human body.

Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the

attic.

BACK TO:

132         INT. TRASH CHUTE - DAY                                            132

RYAN'S still trapped. Sounds of approaching SIRENS in the

distance. Ryan listens for Greer; is he still there?

BANG!!   BANG!!   Two more heavy TARPAPER ROLLS come right at

him!

The first one he gets lucky with, but the second NAILS HIM

before bouncing furiously away and Ryan loses his grip

completely and slides out of control.

133         EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                   133

GREER watches amazed when Ryan actually tumbles out of the

ass-end of the metal chute into the dumpster. He drops the

next roll of tarpaper ready to go and reaches for his gun --

-,

CUT TO:

81.

RYAN is in serious pain.    He frantically fishes through the

refuse to find:

SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE

Or rather, what's left of it:      A million shattered pieces

scattered everywhere.

Ryan sifts through the plastic debris as if he had secretly

hoped he could still use it. Yeah, right... He's barely able

to sit up when --

BLAM!! BLAM!! BLAM!!

He ducks back down as bullets ricochet off the steel

dumpster.

As SIRENS get louder, closer, Ryan's got to make his move --

he jumps out of the dumpster, landing on his ass on the

opposite side of Greer.

BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!

Bullets ricochet off the steel dumpster and Ryan summons his

courage -- and takes off limping!

BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!! Greer's pistol is ill equipped for long-

range shooting. The kid's too far away by now. He grabs his

walkie --

GREER

(into walkie)

The kid's outside, headed toward

the front of the building--

HODGES

-Gotta go, boss. The Guard's dead.

Hodges waits by the rooftop door, looking concerned

as COPS spill out around him onto the roof.

COPS

Who the hell's shooting up here?

Greer points to Ryan bolting around the corner.

GREER

Sonofabitch shot the poor bastard

right in front of us!

CUT TO:

Jessica races across the dead brown lawn toward the guest

house/prison that holds her son. Getting her first good look

82.

at the secluded premises she's on confirms that screaming

would do no good. She's on her own.

When she reaches the guest house, she's shocked to find a

HUGE LOCK on the front door. Frantic, she makes her way

around the structure to a BIG BAY WINDOW. Though it's

protected by SECURITY BARS, she can see Ricky through the

glass.

Jessica pounds on the glass, and Ricky turns.    When her son

sees her, he races to the bars.

RICKY

Mom!

JESSICA

Baby!   Are you okay?!

RICKY

I can't get out!

Jessica looks around for something to bend the bars with.

There's nothing.

A gold FORD TAURUS pulls up in front. The driver door opens

and Mooney gets out. Walks to the front door and KNOCKS.

But this time, there's no answer.

Mooney rings the bell. Still nothing. Suspicious, he checks

around the side...and sees the back door SWAYING in the wind.

Mooney's cop senses scream as he walks inside. A POLICE

SCANNER chatters in the background. The place is a shambles.

Someone's been looking for something. He then sees-

BLOOD STREAKS the floor. It leads from over by the telephone

to underneath the pantry door.

MOONEY

(calling into house)

Hello? L.A.P.D. Anybody home?

No answer.    Drawing his gun, Mooney stalks carefully into--

A SMALL STAIRCASE leads up to the second floor. As Mooney

starts up the steps, BOOM UP to the top to REVEAL:

THE IMPOSTER JESSICA MARTIN (BAYBACK)

Hiding in ambush at the top of the stairs, gun in hand. She

listens to Mooney's footsteps and when she thinks he's neared

the top -- she springs out, blasting away down the staircase!

But Mooney's not there.

83.

MOONEY

Drop your gun, now.   I got you.

Now we see him. Still down in the entryway, behind some

cover, gun aimed and steady.

MOONEY (CONT'D)

I said drop it.'

Bayback relaxes -- then WHIRLS around, disappearing down the

hall! Mooney curses and quietly jogs up the stairs,

following her into--

A narrow hallway with multiple OPEN DOORWAYS on each side.

The Imposter Jessica could be hiding in any one of them...

Taking care not to give himself away, Mooney inches down the

hallway. And just when he's thinking that he may have

successfully created an element of surprise for himself--

SFX: SQUEEEEAK -- the floorboards of the old house groan

softly -- GIVING HIS POSITION AWAY!

Instantly Bayback swings out from a doorway right next to

Mooney, taps her gun to his chest pulls the tang--

But Mooney DIVES OUT OF THE WAY! BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!   Two

miss, but the third shot NAILS HIS SHOULDER!

OOF! Mooney lands hard. Blood spreading out under his white

dress shirt. He cocks his head... listening for the sound of-

BAYBACK EJECTS A MAGAZINE and is about to reload--

Mooney JUMPS UP, RETURNS FIRE -- slamming Bayback against the

wall with two .38 caliber slugs. She collapses to the floor.

MOONEY

Damn it!   DAMN IT!!

Angry, the adrenaline drowning out the pain, Mooney turns to

the kidnapper laying in the hall, bleeding out. Kicks her

gun away and kneels.

But for the first time, Bayback isn't tough.   Just scared.

BAYBACK

..a-ambulance...

MOONEY

Tell me where Jessica Martin is or

you bleed to death right here.

BAYBACK

..p-please..call.. I.. I'm a--

Fuck this, Mooney kicks her ribs.

84.

140                                                                     140

MOONEY

WHERE IS SHE?!

Bayback struggles for air, reaching for him--

BAYBACK

...I'm a cop...

Bayback squeezes her eyes shut against a wave of pain -- and

DIES. Mooney stares at her. What did she say? Starts

patting her down.

And that's when he finds her BADGE.     L.A.P.D.   23rd Precinct.

She is a cop.

MOONEY

Oh shit...

Mooney grits his teeth against a fresh wave of pain and picks

up the phone, dials 911.

MOONEY (CONT'D)

Request emergency back up and medical

units! Officers down at-

Ryan wanders the streets. Checks his wallet -- a measly four

bucks. Despair overtakes him and he almost gets CRUSHED as a-

TOW TRUCK speeds by -- An old Hyundai mounts it like a hippo!

A lightbulb clicks on for Ryan.

RYAN

Ho - shit!

Ryan bolts to the nearest BUS STOP just as a BLUE LINE BUS

pulls up.

CUT TO:

Jessica SMASHES A REAR WINDOW with a long thick branch and

uses it to try to pry the bars apart. The limited leverage

won't enable her to bend them enough for Ricky to squeeze

through.

RICKY

Faster Mom!

And just then--

SFX: GRAVEL CRUNCHING IN THE DRIVEWAY

Jessica leans her head around the back corner of the

guesthouse -- and sees the Escalade pulling in!

85.

JESSICA

(to Ricky)

Get down! Get down!

And Jessica DUCKS OUT OF VIEW just as the--

Pulls into the driveway.

Greer and his team are going over surveillance photos taken

from the cameras at the Fegan Securities Building. The

hotos are useless, though, as Ryan's face is obscured by his

GREER

These are the best pictures you

could get of him?!

ELLIS

He was wearing a visor.

Greer glares at him -- no shit -- and throws the pictures .

GREER

Useless!

The car parks and Greer storms out, followed by Ellis and

Hodges. They head for the house, and the moment they enter --

Jessica reappears. But now she's STARING at something.

The Escalade.

JESSICA

(to son; through window)

Baby, listen to me. I want you to

get away from this window. I want

you to go to the other side of the

room as far away from the door as

you can --

RICKY

No, don't leave me!     Don't leave

me!!

The terror in his voice breaks Jessica's heart.

JESSICA

Honey, I'm getting you out of

there!

RICKY

Where are you going?!

JESSICA

I'm only gonna be gone a second,

and then we're gonna go home, but

you have to do this first. It's

gonna be loud, but don't be scared,

okay? Now go find somewhere safe

like I told you.

86.

Ricky n9ds and runs off into another room of the house.      And

as Jessica rushes for the Escalade --

CUT TO:

PARAMEDICS apply a bandage to Mooney's shoulder.      Mooney's

pretty shaken up.

PARAMEDIC #1

You're lucky. Shot went clean

through. A few inches either

way...

Mooney watches other PARAMEDICS carry sheet-covered corpses

into awaiting ambulances. Flashbulbs POP from inside.

A sedan pulls up and Mooney's relieved to see Tomlin get out.

DETECTIVE TOMLIN

What the hell, Moon? It's all over

the radio.

MOONEY

Jack, she didn't identify herself.

DETECTIVE TOMLIN

What are you saying?

MOONEY

I shot a cop!

(lowering his voice)

Dana Bayback. From the 23rd.     She

was one of the kidnappers.

Tomlin looks stunned by the revelation.

DETECTIVE TOMLIN

Let me call the tw9~three. See

what the hell's going on.

Tomlin pulls out a cellphone.

MOONEY

I hate to think more cops are

involved, but--

DETECTIVE TOMLIN

Did she say anything about the

Martin woman?

MOONEY

...Never got the chance.

Detective Tomlin frowns.

CUT TO:

87.

A GONZOLEZ TOW TRUCK drives up (like the one we saw at the

airport), and stops temporarily beside:

Simon Cowell, from the CADILLAC XLR incident, who stands at

the window, screaming at the JADED CASHIER.

His car idles just on the other side of an IMPOSING FENCE.

SIMON COWELL

Just give me my goddamned car!

JADED CASHIER

Don't take that tone of voice with

me, sir. I've already told you, we

do not release vehicles until all

impound fees are paid.

In the E.G., NOTICE Ryan skulking closer, behind the GONZALEZ

AUTO TOW TRUCK.

SIMON COWELL

But I didn't cause it to get

impounded! Can't you understand

that?! It was stolen from me!

JADED CASHIER

Sir, do you want the car back or

not?

Noticing Cowell standing at the window, Ryan presses further

into the shadows, not wanting to be noticed.

SIMON COWELL

Yes!     But I'm not paying for it!

The Cashier signals a GRUNGY YARD WORKER on the other side of

the fence.

JADED CASHIER

Nevermind, Howie. Take 'er back.

Howie nods, and just as he's about to drive the Cadillac back

into the yard --

SIMON COWELL

Wait, wait! All right you bloody

fascist, I'll pay. But if there's

even the slightest scratch on it...

Howie smiles, thought so, gets out and splits. As Cowell

angrily starts making out a check, the Cashier flicks the

switch to open the gate, and as it opens--

Ryan slips in. He sneaks behind the wheel of the idling

Cadillac. And the moment Cowell hands over his check --

VRRRROOOM!!    Ryan burns rubber out of there.

88.

SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)

Hey, that's my car!

Cowell chases it -- and watches in horror as Ryan takes a

speed bump too fast and TEARS THE REAR BUMPER OFF THE

CADILLAC XLR CONVERTIBLE IN AN EXPLOSION OF SPARKS!

SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)

NOooooooo...!!

As he zooms away, Ryan searches the passenger seat with his

free hand. He hunts through the car and finds -- HIS BLUE

TOOTH VIDEO CELL PHONE!

RYAN

Thank you!

As he flips it open, his eyes spot THE LAPTOP on the floor of

the passenger seat.

The Fagen Securities Building parking lot. A police pursuit

in progress. Three Police Cars skillfully box in a BMW with

TWO HISPANIC YOUTHS, forcing it to come to a dead stop.

GREER and HODGES explode from their cars, guns drawn.

BAYBACK and ELLIS come from the back. DEASON appears, and he

and HODGES yank the teens out of the car, who struggle

frantically to avoid vicious baton blows. When one decks

Hodges and tries to run, ELLIS SHOOTS HIM in the back!

WE QUICKLY PAN TO ANOTHER ANGLE:

Inside the building, CRAIG gets up from his chair, hurries

into-

WE PAN DOWN TO ANOTHER ANGLE

As Craig enters frame inside the Security Office.   And

watches live-

ANOTHER ANGLE:

GREER wastes no time in SHOOTING the second man execution

style!

89.

RYAN watches in horror. He PULLS OVER, too riveted to drive

and watch simultaneously. Finally understanding the

magnitude of this disc.

And as BAYBACK drags a DEAD HISPANIC YOUTH out of the frame,

legs disappear off-screen in short bursts.

PAN DIAGONALLY TO ANOTHER ANGLE:

And more terrifying, GREER stops picking up shell casings,

turning his head ominously toward the CAMERA! Noticing us!

Greer motions to several others; DEASON and BAYBACK, who rush

OUT OF FRAME toward the front entrance.

ANGLE ONE: At the SIDE DOOR, ELLIS and HODGES start kicking

in the door with full force.

ANGLE TWO: GREER, outside, unholstering his GUN at the

DELIVERY ENTRANCE.

BACK TO:

RYAN glances at the cellphone in his hand -- gets an idea!

CUT TO:

rush inside--

ANGLE THREE:     The COPS rush inside the building, consult the

Directory...

ANGLE FOUR:    Craig, panicked, reaches over to the DVD

Recorder --

THE LAPTOP MONITOR -- ALL STATIC.    The recording has stopped.

RYAN

I'm so screwed.

As Ryan speeds away from the curb, he fingers his cellphone.

SERIES OF INTENSE SHOTS:

-- GREER walking up the safehouse stairs, step by step

nearing the attic that Jessica's supposed to still be in...

90.

54   EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY                                  154

-- JESSICA quietly opening the door of the Escalade(

trying not to give herself away. She climbs in behind the

wheel, and says a silent prayer of thanks when she sees that

the keys are still dangling in the ignition.

-- RYAN, in the speeding Cadillac XLR, selects LAST INCOMING

CALL on the cellphone. Holds his breath.

As Greer reaches the first landing, the HOUSE PHONE starts

RINGING. Ignoring it, Greer continues on and is about to turn

the corner to the attic when --

HODGES (OS)

Boss, you better take this.

Greer stops, a footstep away from seeing the open attic door.

From the bottom of the steps, Hodges tosses him a CORDLESS

PHONE. Greer puts it to his ear.

GREER

What?

MATCH CUT TO:

Ryan, inside the Cadillac XLR, growls into the cellphone.

RYAN

Shut up and listen to me, asswipe.

I got what you want.

MALE VOICE (VO)

Who is this?

RYAN

You know who this is, shithead!

CUT TO:

To our surprise, Ryan isn't talking to Greer...but to the

same TELEMARKETER that called him earlier.

TELEMARKETER

Look, sir, we can take your name

off our list if you want, but you

don't have to get nasty--

RYAN (VO)

What--?    Who is this?

TELEMARKETER

Mark.     At Mastercharge Credit Union-

91.

RYAN (VO)

*59             A frickin' telemarketer? But I                            159

just hit "Last Incoming Call"--

Ryan suddenly puts it together.

RYAN (VO) (CONT'D)

You bastard.

The Telemarketer quickly hangs up before it gets ugly.

CUT BACK TO:

Greer listens intently to a call.   So who is on his end of

the phone? Tomlin.

TOMLIN (VO)

Look, Captain, we've got to do

everything we can to protect this

guy. I mean, shit, with all his

years in he's owed a little.

TOMLIN STANDING NEXT TO MOONEY OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE

GREER VO

He's with you? How'd he find out?

TOMLIN

Said something about a kid who came

into the station earlier--

Greer grimaces, putting it together.

GREER

Early twenties? Stumbled out of

Brian Wilson's hamper?

TOMLIN

Yeah.   Something like that.

GREER

Tomlin. Take care of him.      No

witnesses.

That's more than Tomlin bargained for.

TOMLIN

Are you sure that's necessary, sir?

GREER

You know once the shitstorm starts,

there's nothing I can do to save

you.

TOMLIN

Sure. That's what I thought.        I'll

tell him.

92.

160                                                                    160

Tomlin hangs up with a calm FLICK.   The Paramedic finishes up

Mooney's bandage.

PARAMEDIC #1

Keep pressure on it until you get

it stitched.

MOONEY

What's the word?

TOMLIN

Not g9od. I.A.'s not throwing out

any lifelines with all that's going

on.. .

(re: Mooney's sh9ulder)

Come on. You can write a statement

while I take you to the hospital.

CUT TO:

161   INT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - STAIRWELL LEADING TO THE ATTIC 161

Greer slips the cordless into his jacket pocket, continuing

up the stairs. Hodges follows, staring expectantly.

HODGES

Well?   What'd he say?

GREER

You know a desk jockey named

Mooney?

HODGES

-- HOLY SHIT!

Greer sees Hodges gaping up the stairwell. Following his

look, Greer turns...and sees the attic door WIDE OPEN!

Further in, he can make out Deason's bloody body and the

rigged-together phone...

In fact, the only thing Greer doesn't see is Jessica.

GREER

NO!

Greer turns and pounds down the stairs.

BACK TO:

162    EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY                                 162

JESSICA - IN THE ESCALADE

She TWISTS the key and STOMPS the gas, sending the monster

SUV on a collision course with -- SMASHHH -- the guest house

window! The bay window SHATTERS and the security bar SNAP

LIKE TWIGS as the Escalade BULLDOZES through!

*,

Unable to open the door because of all the debris, Jessica

rolls down the window and yells to her son --

93.

162                                                                     162

Ricky!    Come on!

-- but he's frozen in fear at all the noise and dust.    He

shakes his head. No.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

Baby, please! It's okay now.

We're gonna go home!

(glances back nervously)

Ricky, please!

Somehow, the kid digs deep and finds the courage to run to

the Escalade, where his mother scoops him up into the cab

just as--

The kitchen door bursts open and Greer's team spills out into

the yard. They spot her instantly.

ELLIS

Get out of the car!    Get out of the

goddamned car!!

As they rush at her--

Jessica throws the big car in reverse and tries to back out --

but the Escalade's stuck! Caught by the debris, the wheels

just spin.

JESSICA

Come on!    COME ON!!

Jessica rocks the car forward, and back. Forward, and back.

And just as it finally comes loose -- KRRRAAASHHH!!

The window next to Jessica's head EXPLODES in a shower of

tempered glass, shocking us. Two arms snake in and wrap

around Jessica's neck. Greer.

But Jessica STOMPS ON THE GAS, hoping the big car will pull

her free.

It doesn't. As the Escalade surges away across the lawn,

Greer's vice-like grip holds, PULLING JESSICA OUT the broken

window and -- THUMP! -- to the guest house debris below.

As Jessica watches in horror:

THE DRIVERLESS ESCALADE

Careens down the driveway and crashes into a pillar.    Hodges

races over and yanks Ricky out.

GREER

Balls his fist in Jessica's hair and yanks her around hard.

GREER

WHO DID YOU TELL?!

94.

JESSICA

Nobody!

GREEK

LYING BITCH! ! WHO WAS THAT KID IN

THE MAIL ROOM?!

Jessica screams as he yanks her to her knees.

RICKY

Stop it!   Don't hurt her!!

Seething mad, Greer rips his gun from its holster and is

literally about to blow Jessica's brains out when--

SFX:   THE CORDLESS PHONE IN GREER'S POCKET STARTS RINGING!

The entire world stops. There's an awkward moment: Jessica

cowering, Greer recovering, the phone just ringing and

ringing... The telephone is the only sound in the world,

getting louder and louder with each ring until--

Greer answers it.

GREER

Bad timing, Tomlin.

But it isn't Tomlin on the phone this time.       It's--

RYAN (VO)

Feel like a trade?

INTERCUT PHONE CALL:

Greer snaps his fingers at Hodges, indicating it's Ryan.

GREER

The mysterious bike messenger.   How

did you get this number?

In the Cadillac, PUSH IN on Ryan t9 show the CELLPHONE MANUAL

he picked up at the Verizon store in his hand.

RYAN

Gotta love modern technology... My new

phone knows the numbers of the last

fifty incoming calls.

GREER

What do you want?

RYAN

Just the woman and her kid.

GREER

Who are you? What's your name?

95.

RYAN

My name is F you. I've got your

shit, pal, it doesn't work that

way.

GREEK

Really?

(turns to Ellis)

Go cut the kid's throat.

Though Ryan's eyes widen in panic, his voice remains cool.

RYAN

Fine.     Your loss.   Nice talking to

you.

And Ryan hangs up. He waits nervously, sweating, staring at

the phone for the longest seconds of his life--

RYAN (CONT'D)

Ring.     C'mon, damn it, ring!   RING!

Then it does. Ryan waits a couple rings, slowing his

speeding heart, then nonchalantly picks up.

GREER

So, how do you want to do this?

RYAN

Put on a big ass Ronald McDonald smile,

apologize to the kid and the woman and

bring 'em to the Santa Monica pier.

GREER (VO)

No.     Somewhere quieter.

RYAN

Dude, you're lucky I'm still

talkin' to your sorry ass. You do

as I say, exactly as I say, or I

hang up now and slap this bitch on

Nightline, you know what I'm

sayin'?

There's a long beat.

GREER (VO)

Fine.    But you come alone.

RYAN

Done.

GREER (VO)

How will I recognize you?

RYAN

You let me worry about that.

What's your cell number?

GREER (VO)

(310) 555-8342. An hour then?

96.

RYAN

I can hardly wait.

Ryan hangs up.    A scared, but satisfied smile...

CUT TO:

MOONEY - In the sedan's shotgun seat, is trying to write his

statement. But with his bad shoulder, it's useless.

He winces in pain when the sedan jerks at a four-way stop.

MOONEY

(to Tomlin)

Shouldn't we be on Pico?

To the right, some PEOPLE wait for a bus.      Tomlin turns left.

TOMLIN

County will have a six hour wait.

Ten if they know you're a cop.

Mooney grunts his gratitude as Tomlin heads toward a

wasteland of warehouses. And just as any potential witnesses

vanish from sight --

Tomlin's cellphone RINGS!      He lowers the gun and answers the

call.

TOMLIN (CONT'D)

Yeah?

GREER (OS)

Is it taken care of?

TOMLIN

Not yet.

GREER (OS)

Good. We're making a trade with the

kid at the Santa Monica Pier. Your

boy can ID the kid for us. Bring him

down.

TOMLIN

(relieved)

I'm on it.

Tomlin flips his phone closed and turns the car around.

TOMLIN (CONT'D)

We caught a break with the kid. He's

been spotted on the pier. Think you

can hang on a little longer? Just

enough to ID the kid before we patch

you up?

Mooney clearly doesn't want to say "no."     But it hurts.

97 .

TOMLIN (CONT'D)

Whaddaya say? Up to you.

Beat.

MOONEY

Let's solve the goddamn thing.

CUT TO:

An AERIAL SHOT at magic hour, tracking up the coast to the --

Boats clog the water, and th9usands of SPECTATORS line the

shores of the Pacific, watching the HEAL THE BAY concert on

the pier.

With all the CHEERING, DANCING and DRINKING going on, it's

like Times Square on New Years Eve.

Ryan drives up in the Cadillac XLR and parks. A group of

COLLEGE FRIENDS stare enviously at the car as Ryan gets out.

ENVIOUS COLLEGE KID

Lucky bastard...

RYAN

You like it?

(tosses him the keys)

Happy Birthday.

THUD. The Friends' jaws hit the ground. And as they run to

the Cadillac XLR, Ryan disappears into the crowd...

Creeps down the wooden bridge and stops at the bottom; the

base of the pier.

Inside, Hodges sits behind the wheel; Jessica and Ricky lay

bound and gagged in back.

Hodges lifts his Nextel and thumbs the button.

HODGES

I'm in position.

CUT TO:

Greer and Ellis are on top of the CAROUSEL BUILDING. Ellis

lays on his belly with a POLICE SNIPER RIFLE and some fuzzy

PHOTOS of Ryan from the mailroom.

98.

GREEK

Copy.

171   POV - THROUGH ELLIS' SNIPER SCOPE                                 171

Excellent magnification. We skim the faces of the crowd,

hunting for Ryan and locates HODGES.

CUT TO:

172   EXT. CAROUSEL ROOFTOP - OVERLOOKING THE PIER                      172

Greer is talking to Ellis, who's scanning the crowd ROCKING

to the concert --

GREER

Only take the kid out if it's

clean. No guess work. The last

thing we need's a stampede.

Greer paces anxiously -- when suddenly his Nextel RINGS.     He

answers it, though it's hard to hear over the music.

GREER (CONT'D)

You here?

RYAN (VO)

Yeah.

Greer nods to Ellis -- It's him.     Find him.

GREER

How do you want to do this?

RYAN (VO)

First show me that Jessica and the

kid are okay.

GREER

Do you have the disc?

RYAN (VO)

Yes.     Where are they?

GREER

See the black van at the bottom of

the bridge? Passenger side window.

RYAN (VO)

Hang on.

(beat)

Okay, got it.

Greer muffles the phone against his leg.     Whispers to Ellis:

GREER

He's within visual of the car.

Greer takes his police walkie and toggles it.

*

99.

GREEK (INTO WALKIE) (CONT'D)

Hodges, show the woman. Lower the

passenger side window only.

CUT TO:

The PASSENGER-SIDE TINTED WINDOW rolls down.

Hodges sits Jessica up, then her kid, displaying them for a

few seconds before powering the window back up.

CUT TO:

GREER (INTO PHONE)

Did you see that?

RYAN (VO)

Yes.

Greer muffles the phone again.      Whispers to Ellis.

GREER

He's around the passenger side.

Have you found him yet?

ELLIS (VO)

No.

(throws his photos)

I don't know what the hell he looks

like!

GREER

He's the one on the cellphone, you

idiot 1

Everyone in the crowd is on a cellphone.

ELLIS (VO)

Everyone's on a cellphone! I've

got like fifty possible targets

here!

Ellis' cross hairs flit from one person on a cell, to

another, to another...

CUT TO:

TOMLIN AND MOONEY move along the crowd, scanning the sea of

spectators for Ryan. Mooney moves more slowly behind Tomlin,

skin looking pale, sheened in sweat and laboring for breath

as they hike up the bridge.

100.

77   EXT. CAROUSEL ROOFTOP                                                177

GREER

Your turn.    Now you show me

something.

RYAN (VO)

No. Put them on the Ferris wheel.

I want to see them safe first.

GREER

That wasn't part of the deal.

RYAN (VO)

Deal's changed.

MATCH CUT TO:

178      EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - BLUFF - NIGHT                               178

The top of the bluffs, overlooking the pier below.       Among the

crowd, some SKATE RATS scare the ELDERLY.

RYAN (VO)

I've been thinking. Does me no

good to hand over the DVD and then

you and the funky bunch take us

out.

GREER (VO)

I swore I wouldn't do that.

RYAN

Like you swore to protect and

serve?

The reference brings Greer up short.       There's a moment, then:

GREER

You know a lot...

RYAN

And I'll forget a lot, too. But

not until they're both out of

danger.

Now PAN AROUND TO REVEAL Ryan among the crowd, wearing a

SURFING WINDBREAKER; HOODED with WATERPROOF POCKETS -- but

where's his cellphone?

Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the

Verizon store. With the earbud concealed under the loose

hood, Ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Your choice, man. The Martins or

the DVD. Either way, I'm not

hanging around any longer. You got

five seconds, then I disconnect

your ass.

101.

GREEK

You sure you know what you're

doing?

RYAN

One...     Two...

On the other end of the phone:

GREER wrestles with his better judgment--

RYAN

Three...    Four...

--but Ryan's got him by the balls.     Angrily, Greer lifts his

walkie.

GREER

Okay! Okay.

(into walkie)

Hodges, put 'em on the Ferris

wheel.

HODGES (VO)

What? I

GREER

Shut up and do it!

RYAN

Not bad. Most people never get

past two.

Greer flinches as his own taunts are used against him.

GREER

(to Ellis)

Keep an eye on them. As soon as we

make the trade, take the woman and

her kid out.

CUT TO:

RYAN watches from a distance as Hodges exits the van.

GREER (VO)

Don't screw me kid, y9u won't live

long enough to enjoy it.

RYAN

Oooh, I think I just pissed myself.

Ryan looks optimistic when Hodges gets out and opens the back

door. And just as he's on the brink of success--

FEMALE VOICE (OS)

HEY--!

102.

180                                                                      180

A woman's HAND grabs the hood of Ryan's windbreaker and rips

it away from his face. Wheels him around. It's:

CHLOE

There you are! Where the hell were

you! ?

RYAN

Chloe!    Get away from here!

CHLOE

Know how many hours I waited for

you to bring back those stupid

shirts?! What'd you do? Sell them

on the Prominade yourself--?

But Ryan's got no time for this.

RYAN

GO!    NOW!!

A sickly-looking MOONEY glances at the commotion -- and sees

the hoodless Ryan.

MOONEY

(motioning to Tomlin)

That's him! There he is!

12     EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - BLUFF - NIGHT                            182

Ryan desperately tries to shoo Chloe away.

RYAN

It isn't safe to talk, get it? I --

People are after me!

CHLOE

(shrugs free)

What -- are you high?

Suddenly, Mooney steps up beside Ryan and grabs him.

MOONEY

(winded)

I've been..looking for..you, kid--

But Ryan struggles, thinking Mooney is with the bad guys.

Mooney grabs him as he tries to make a break for it.

RYAN

Let go of me! Sonofabitch, let go!

MATCH CUT TO:

GREER's pissed.     Pacing on the roof, when:

103.

t_             ELLIS

I've got him!

Instantly, Greer jams the walkie to his face, and we--

CUT TO:

HODGES is about to let Jessica out of the van, when he hears--

GREER (OVER WALKIE)

Hodges, do not let them go! Do you

hear me? Do not let them go!

BACK TO:

RYAN struggles with Mooney. The crowd completely ignores

them in favor of the raucous concert.

In the heat of battle, Ryan's cellphone clatters by Chloe' s

feet.

MOONEY

(sweating profusely)

Jesus, kid, calm down!!

Trying to break Mooney's stronghold, Ryan SHOVES him

backwards, SLAMMING his injured shoulder into the PIER

RAILING.

Mooney SCREAMS out in pain and grabs his shoulder, releasing--

Ryan, who BREAKS AWAY and turns to see Mooney COLLAPSE to the

ground, holding his blood-soaked shoulder. Ryan looks over

to Chloe, whose face is a combination of shock and confusion.

CHLOE

Oh my God--

(checking Mooney)

Someone call 911!

A CROWD starts to gather when --

Ryan feels the barrel of a gun nudging his back.     Tomlin's

gun.

TOMLIN

It's over kid.

Fuck! Ryan's got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end

of the pier.

MOONEY - From his prone position, he catches a glimpse of

Tomlin backing Ryan quietly into the crowd. Not trying to

help. Not calling for an ambulance. In that instant, Mooney

knows he's been betrayed. Tomlin's in on this.

104.

TOMLIN (CONT'D)

For all the trouble you've caused,

you'd better have that goddamned

disc. Where is it?

Just then, Greer appears through the crowd ahead of him.

Like a nightmare, he closes in.

Ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his

windbreaker and zips it up.

RYAN

Aw shit...

Ryan's world is spinning -- the NOISE, the CROWDS, the

TENSION...

He KICKS BACK hard into Tomlin's SHIN. It is enough for

Tomlin to release his grip and Ryan bolts.

Tomlin recovers and raises his GUN to get a bead on Ryan, but

it causes the crowd around him to PANIC.

CROWD GOER (OS)

Dude's gotta gun!

Ryan navigates through the fleeing crowd and turns to see

Greer and Tomlin quickly gaining ground.

He has to make a choice, either go over the railing, or deal

with Greer and Tomlin. Ryan decides on the ocean. He runs

to a MAN FISHING WITH HIS SON and uses their ice chest as a

step. Just as he JUMPS THE RAIL -- Tomlin gets off a SHOT!

SLIIIIIICEE!!! The bullet tears through Ryan's shoulder as

he spins headlong into the Pacific!

TOMLIN AND GREER run to the railing and see Ryan HIT the

CHOPPY WATER below.

GREER

Under the pier. Go! Go!

Ryan flails, panicking, exhaling all his air and sucking in

the dark water of the ocean --

Ryan is struggling. Bleeding. Sinking. Dying. His lungs

convulse, trying to breathe, burning like a thousand red-hot

needles are pushing their way through his chest.

The WAVES POUND against the thick pylons below the pier. Just

as Ryan comes up for air he's SLAMMED into a wooden pylon!

Ryan fights for his life as the surge churns him underwater,

BASHING him repeatedly against the pillars. It's not pretty.

105.

187                                                                     187

As he struggles toward the shore, he's constantly thrown back

and forth underwater like a rag doll.

CUT TO:

TOMLIN races down the pier towards the beach --

GREEK aims his weapon at the ocean, daring Ryan to surface.

CUT TO:

Ryan finally makes it to shore; coughing, retching. He crawls

up the sand, out of breath, blood trailing behind him.

He unzips the waterproof pocket of his shorts, pulling out

the cellphone, which thank God is actually dry. Ryan forces

himself into action; stumbling, exhausted into a --

The place is dark. Empty. An array of rowing shells covered

in ghostly, flapping tarps make the place look vaguely haunted.

This place is also filled with storage equipment, such as

buoys and safety netting used by the beach patrol.

CUT TO:

TOMLIN - racing through the sand under the pier. He spots

Ryan's bloody footprints and follows them toward the --

RYAN - sees Tomlin coming.   Ryan's trapped like a rat -- and

dripping blood everywhere.

He looks for anything that'll save him, but finds only

useless boating tools (sanders, saws, box cutters, etc.)

RYAN

(to himself)

Think! Think!

Chloe hands Mooney a cup of water and frantically looks

around for the paramedics. Mooney starts rising to his feet.

CHLOE

You better lie still. The

paramedics should be here shortly.

But Mooney's obstinate.   He rises despite her best efforts.

106.

MOONEY

Just keep that ambulance close by.

And as he stumbles off--

TOMLIN - By the time his eyes adjust to the dark, Ryan is

nowhere to be seen. TARPS undulate over jumbles of boxes and

equipment everywhere -- a hundred places to hide.

Alone, Tomlin stalks among the equipment.     Gun out.   Hunting

Ryan like a snake on the scent or prey.

TOMLIN

You're wounded kid, just give me

what I came for, and I'll let you

all go.

Police sirens in the distance grow louder.

Tomlin's offer goes unanswered.    That's when he notices the

BLOOD on the ground. Tomlin smiles, following Ryan's trail

to a PILE OF BLOOD-SMEARED TARPS -- where the trail ends!

It's obvious Ryan used these to staunch his wound. Shit!

He's gonna have to search this whole place--

Then, suddenly, Tomlin gets an idea. He pulls out his phone,

making sure it's concealed from view, and writes a TEXT

MESSAGE to--

Greer pulls out his ringing cell phone. On the text screen

it says, "CALL HIM". Greer flashes an wicked grin, and dials

the last number on his call log.

CUT TO:

Tomlin's ready to pounce.

SFX:   Nearby, Ryan's cellphone starts to RING, betraying him!

Instantly, Tomlin hones in on the noise -- coming from under

a bulky tarp along the far wall -- and EMPTIES HIS GUN at it!

The tarp shreds. Nothing could survive the assault.

Tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp.

TOMLIN

Shoulda stayed at home this

morning, kid.

And just then, Tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing--

Ryan's cellphone.   And nothing else.

107 .

^_        RYAN (OS)

Funny. I was about to say the same

to you.

TOMLIN

What the--

And in the instant Tomlin realizes he's been tricked, he

turns and--

WHAM!

RYAN HITS TOMLIN in the face with a 2x4, SMASHING his TEETH

and sending him backwards. Before Tomlin has time to

rec9ver, Ryan swings again. CRACK! -- And his KNEE CAP is

obliterated. Ryan, looking like a psychotic Babe Ruth, gives

Tomlin two more vicious WHACKS before grabbing his cellphone

and high-tailing it out of there.

CUT TO:

HODGES - has no luck on the walkie.

HODGES

Tomlin? Anyone copy?

Jessica, cuffed from behind, covertly wriggles the handcuffs

under her ass toward her feet. Ricky, terrified, screams

"no" with his eyes. But she knows she's out of time.

CUT TO:

RYAN - losing blood, he does his best to move quickly through

the sand. He stumbles, but regains his footing as he makes

his way towards the STAIRS LEADING UP TO THE PIER.

CUT TO:

ELLIS - still on the roof, scans the pier.

Hodges locates Ryan emerging from the stairs.

ELLIS

Got him.   He's in the parking lot.

CUT TO:

HODGES - listening intently to the walkie.

108.

201                                                                     201

ELLIS (OS)

I've got a clean shot.

GREEK (OS)

No! We don't have the DVD. Just

hold his location. Hodges, parking

lot now!

Just as Hodges reaches for the door handle -- Jessica wraps

her cuffs around his throat, throws her legs against the back

of his seat and pulls like her life depended on it.

Hodges chokes, flails, digs, and claws at the cuffs, but his

fingertips are no match for Jessica's muscular legs.

JESSICA

Ricky run!    Find help!

Ricky's paralyzed with fear.

JESSICA (CONT'D)

RUN!

Ricky bolts from the car.

CUT TO:

202     EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - BRIDGE - NIGHT                           202

POLICE CRUISERS race down the pier bridge, desperately trying

to avoid the fleeing crowd.

CUT TO:

203     INT. KIDNAPPERS' VAN - NIGHT                                      203

JESSICA - finishes squeezing the last bit of life out of

Hodges.

She finally exits the van, but not before grabbing the WALKIE

TALKIE and GUN.

BACK TO:

204     EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                          204

RYAN - sneaking his way through parked cars, heads in the

direction of the Police Cruisers on the bridge.

CUT TO:

205     EXT. CAROUSEL - NIGHT                                             205

MOONEY - scanning the pier for Ryan, hears-

ELLIS (OS)

He's heading for the cops.       We

should do it now.

Mooney looks to the roof of the carousel and sees Ellis.

10 9.

MOONEY

""Freeze! Drop your weapon!

Ellis quickly swings his rifle and--

BAM! Mooney shoots Ellis in the head, causing him to slide

off the carousel roof.

CUT BACK TO:

RYAN - stopping in his tracks, looks in the direction of the

gun shot. He turns around only to find --

A PISTOL pointed right at his face -- Greer's pistol.

He PUSHES Ryan behind a SUV so as not to be seen by the cops.

GREEK

No more bullshit!     Just give me the

goddamn disc!

Ryan slowly unzips his front jacket pocket and removes the

DVD.

Greer snatches it and SMASHES it to pieces. Fragments fall

through the cracks in the pier, to the ocean below.

Ryan, pale as ghost, knows he's seconds from meeting his

maker.

GREER (CONT'D)

This is about to be the most

enjoyable part of an extremely

shitty day.

And just as he's about to pull the trigger --

BLAM!! Jessica fires a WARNING SHOT. Greer( startled, spins

around to see Jessica pointing Hodges' gun in his face.

JESSICA

Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

For the first time, Greer actually looks frightened.

Recognizing the homicidal look in her eyes, he SPUTTERS, but

nothing comes out.

Ryan, weak and pale with blood loss, looks up at his guardian

angel.

RYAN

Jess... Jessica?     Don't.

Jessica trembles with rage, a tear falls.

JESSICA

I... I have to.

110.

206                                                                      206

MOONEY (O.S.)

Lower the weapon, Jessica.

Jessica looks behind her and sees Mooney, surrounded by EIGHT

POLICE OFFICERS.

MOONEY (CONT'D)

(trying to reason with

her)

Ricky's safe. It's all going to be

okay. Put it down.

Jessica slowly lowers the gun and looks into Ryan's face.

JESSICA

Thank you for keeping your promise.

As the cops move in and drag Greer to his feet, Ryan calls

out to him.

RYAN

Hey man, your shitty day is about

to get a whole lot shittier.

Ryan flips open his phone and on the SCREEN plays the

SECURITY FOOTAGE of the murder in the parking lot. We see

that Ryan must've copied the DVD with his videophone.

RYAN (CONT'D)

Ain't that a bitch?

And through the tears, Jessica manages a laugh. A small one.

But enough to let us know everything's going to be okay. And

as we PULL BACK on the scene--

DISSOLVE TO:

207         INT. HOSPITAL DAYROOM - NIGHT                                   207

The ECU OF A TELEVISION SCREEN

showing an aerial shot of the Santa Monica Pier.

PULL OUT to reveal-

CHLOE AND RYAN, sitting in a hospital dayroom, engrossed in

the NEWS REPORT that plays in the far corner of the room.

Ryan's shoulder has now been BANDAGED, his arm's in a sling.

NEWS ANCHOR

...The Santa Monica Pier was the

latest setting in the ongoing 23rd

Precinct corruption scandal. Ryan

Ackerman, a local resident, risked

his life to save a family kidnapped

by officers to cover up...

Chloe strokes Ryan's scalp with her fingers.

111.

CHLOE

"""How does it feel to be a hero?

RYAN

(re: his wounds)

It hurts... But you're making it

way better. I'm just glad it's

over.

CHLOE

(smiling)

Modesty can be sexy.

RYAN

And to think this was our first

date.

CHLOE

Next time, skip the shower.

In the background, Jessica and Ricky exit a hospital room and

join the two lovebirds.

JESSICA

Craig's very weak, but the doctors

say it looks promising. He's

probably going to have to walk with

a cane, but that's the worst of

it... I'm just thankful.

Chloe senses that Jessica and Ryan might need a moment alone.

CHLOE

Come on Ricky, let's get a hot

chocolate.

A small smile forms on Ricky's exhausted face. Chloe leads

Ricky down the hall.

JESSICA

I can't believe I almost lost

everything that means... I don't

know how I can ever thank you.

RYAN

I do.

(weak smile)

Don't ever call me again.

A shared laugh, then as they turn to the television--

ECU OF SECURITY FOOTAGE OF THE PARKING LOT MURDER

A CELL PHONE RINGS on a nearby table. They turn to look at

it, neither one apparently having any idea to whom it might

belong...

But this time, as we PULL BACK on the scene, we realize no

one's going to answer it.

CUT TO BLACK.
