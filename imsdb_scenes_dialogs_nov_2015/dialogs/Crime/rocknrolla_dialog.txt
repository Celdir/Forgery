WHITE Revision   -   6-6-07                                  1.

1   INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY                                      1

WE MEET: MUMBLES(late 30s) and ONE TWO (late 30s). They are

listening to a sales pitch from two REAL ESTATE AGENTS.

We SEE all the relevant pictures of their pitch explaining a

changing city, LONDON.

SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)

Two years ago this property cost one

million pounds.

(we SEE building)

Today, it costs five million.

The camera WHIP PANS over to another part of the building to

see the other ESTATE AGENT giving his pitch. The camera

will keep this back and forth for the duration of the scene.

OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)

How did this happen?

(CUT TO relevant

pictures as he speaks)

Attractive tax opportunities for

foreign investment, restrictive

building consent and massive hedge

fund bonuses,...

(beat)

London, my good man, is fast becoming

the financial and cultural capital

of the world.

SLICK ESTATE AGENT

And of course the Russians have come

to town.

OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT

Makes it hard to compete with an ex-

Soviet oligarch that has six billion

dollars in his back pocket. They

don't haggle the price, they double

the price.

SLICK ESTATE AGENT

Russians come, prices rise, and it

doesn't stop. It only goes one way.

OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT

Up.

SLICK ESTATE AGENT

I can't teach you how to skin a cat,

but I can tell you a lot about the

money in bricks and mortar.

One Two and Mumbles look at one another.

ONE TWO

We need to see a Lawyer.

2   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE                                             2

CUT TO a modern looking LAWYER'S office.   We SEE the LAWYER

advising MUMBLES AND ONE TWO.

LAWYER TYPE

They say it's only going one way.

3   EXT. STREET - DAY                                                3

ONE TWO and the LAWYER are here looking at the building, it

is a bit dilapidated and bleak.

LAWYER TYPE

It looks like a great deal.

4   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE                                             4

We cut back into the office where the LAWYER lays out the

building plans.

LAWYER TYPE

These are the plans,...it costs ten

and it'll be worth twenty with

planning. But first you gotta give

the councilor a drink.

5   INT. COUNCILOR'S OFFICE                                          5

CUT TO the desk of a COUNCILOR (mid thirties middle

management)who is receiving a brown envelope from the LAWYER.

COUNCILOR

(off the envelope)

Tell them they'll get the planning,...

6   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE                                             6

We CUT BACK to our LAWYER now smug.    One Two and Mumbles are

standing in front of him.

LAWYER TYPE

You'll get the planning. Take care

of the councilor and it will move

like shit through a goose.

mortar, properties are always the

safe bet, but you better know what

you're doing 'cos this ain't soft

LENNY COLE

What do you mean you can't get the

fuckin planning?

(pointing)

There is seven million of my cash in

there, without planning it's worth

five,...you owe me. I take the

building, you lose your share, but I

COUNCILOR (V.O.)

LENNY COLE

ARCHY

That's a bit strong isn't it Len?

They come from the same place as

you, you'll clean 'em out.

LENNY COLE

Same place as me? Do I look like an

immigrant Archy?

No one gave me a leg up, did they?

They need a bit of fear, 'cos

otherwise they're gonna come up

against me,...need a little lesson

URI

Glad you could join us here Lenny.

LENNY COLE

It's nice to see you Uri.

URI

Good.

(there is a pause)

I can see we are very much alike you

and I Lenny. We like to get things

done.

(beat)

What's it going to cost me?

LENNY COLE

First, let me make clear how much we

can help you benefit from this deal.

With out me, it will take you five

to ten years to get the permission

to erect your arena.

(beat)

Second, with Government policy as it

so stands we both know it's unlikely

that you'd ever get that consent.

(beat)

Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions

and building consent, you'd be paying

6 to 12 million without any real

guarantee of that result.

Seven million Euros.

URI

I expect a guarantee that I have

consent within six months and no red

tape.

LENNY COLE

That's right Uri, you can consider

that done.

URI

That picture has brought me nothing

but luck Lenny,..it's my lucky

picture.

(he has a good idea)

You like? Take it for a while, maybe

it will give you luck.

Oh I couldn't Uri,...

Now we're partners, I insist. I

will get it sent around to your house

My hat is deep and full of magic. I

He'll be gearing himself up somewhere

Am I a dancer? Shall we put the

One Two makes room in front of him and starts to dance

relativity badly. You get the feeling he probably could

dance, but he just can't be bothered to make an effort.

ONE TWO (CONT'D)

You see it's all in the genes.

My Dad was a dancer and his Dad before

Pete picks up the pack as Johnny keeps his eyes shut. The

following story is a montage of pack shots of the cigarette

box, intercut with Johnny's delicate fingers stroking the

keys.

JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)

You will notice that one of your

personalities is seduced by the

illusions of grandeur. A "gold"

packet of "king" size and with a

"regal" insignia. An attractive

implication toward glamour and wealth,

a subtle suggestion that cigarettes

are indeed your "royal" and loyal

friends. And that Pete,...is a lie.

(beat)

Your other personality is trying to

draw your attention to the flip side

of the discussion. Written in boring,

bold, black and white is the

statement, that these neat little

soldiers of death, are in fact, trying

to "kill you." And that Pete,...is

the truth.

(beat)

Beauty is a beguiling call to death

and I am addicted to the sweet siren

of its pitch. And that,..is why,..you

and I love the crack, and that is

also why I can not,.. give that

painting back.

He opens his eyes and looks at Pete, his cigarette has gone

out.

SMASH!!!! Their car is smashed into a tailspin, by Handsome

Bob's truck. The Range Rover eventually lands on it's side,

steam, spinning wheels, smoke, and glass is everywhere.

Bob jumps out of his truck and runs down to the second getaway

car waiting. We SEE One Two and Mumbles get out of their

car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are

carrying an axe and bolt cutters. Inside, CHECHNYAN 2 slowly

opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the

window. TWO CHOPS and the window gives in. One Two leans

in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's

wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles

uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free.

MUMBLES

There's another case, grab it.

One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1.

As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the

car by CHECHNYAN 2.

ONE TWO

The bastard's still kicking.     Mace

him, mace him!

Mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays

mace everywhere, including into One Two's eyes.

ONE TWO (CONT'D)

Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not me you idiot,

the Guerrilla!

CHECHNYAN 2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength

and is still pulling One Two into the car with him. We can

SEE Bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car

looking concerned.

ONE TWO (CONT'D)

Shoot him, shoot him, the bastards

going to eat me!

Mumbles pulls out a revolver, sticks it in the window and

fires it into CHECHNYAN 2's leg. This just aggravates the

CHECHNYAN.

Arhhhhhhhhhhh.     That's my fuckin

One Two manages to head butt CHECHNYAN 2 and goes back to

reclaiming the case from CHECHNYAN 1. He pulls it out and

Mumbles cuts the chain. One Two can't see a thing.

MUMBLES

Let's go, we've got it.

ONE TWO

Give me a hand, you've blinded me!

Major confusion is setting in. They run back to their car,

which is still running, Mumbles shoves One Two into the back

and jumps in the drivers seat.

ONE TWO (CONT'D)

Go, go, go, go!!!!!!

With his window open, Mumbles wheel spins out of the situation

and turns to check on One Two. From out of nowhere a very

large CHECHNYAN arm shoots through the window and puts Mumbles

in a neck lock. The CHECHNYAN 2 is holding on and not letting

go.

The car tears across the road and enters a shop window that

has a mezzanine. The car comes to a halt on a precarious

ledge, it's dangling with the CHECHNYAN 2 still not letting

go.

One Two can get a clear shot into the CHECHNYAN 2's side.

He shots him once, CHECHNYAN 2 doesn't move, twice, three

times, four times, he finally lets go and falls down on the

floor.

Councilor. This, as you know, is

the ninth hole and it is a long crawl

back to your car. You should make

it by sunrise, just in time to bring

me my "lucky picture." I want it

back do you hear me?

Victor kicks him.

LENNY COLE

Yes,..yes.

URI

After that, I don't want to hear

from you again, disappear do you

understand me Lenny?

(Victor stands on his

broken legs arrrrgh)

Lenny?

LENNY COLE

Yes, yes, I understand.

Victor dips into his Lenny's pocket and extracts his phone.

URI

Times just change.

(Uri gets in the buggy)

Good bye Lenny.

He gets into the buggy with Victor and drives off.

One Two comes in and closes the door behind him.

He looks down on the floor and there is THE PAINTING, we see

a large note on it that says.

"Let myself in, thought your lady would like the painting.

Love, Cookie"

The door bell rings, he opens it and there stands Stella.

She walks in straight past One Two, he turns round with his

mouth open, she gently slaps it shut and kisses him.

Lenny is clearly distressed, his confidence has gone.

LENNY COLE

I need that picture Archy, I need it

bad.

ARCHY

I'll get it, don't you worry and I

think I can do better than that.

This catches his attention.

LENNY COLE

ARCHY

Someone has been at the Russian's

There, it's on floor.

Leant up against the wall is the lucky painting, she stops

and looks at it, the camera slowly creeps into her face. We

observe One Two looking for a reaction.

ONE TWO (CONT'D)

Like it?

STELLA

You have very good taste,...Mr One

Two.

She picks up the painting and turns smiling.

STELLA (CONT'D)

Good bye.

With that she is off and out the door. One Two grabs the

70s retro headphones above his head and slaps them on his

ears. He presses the remote control and the music kicks in.

Roman and Mickey walk in to see Johnny slouched and watching

TV, more silly cartoons. He's got his top off and he's

smoking a ciggy. His feet are resting on an old chair and

Pete is asleep next to him. Johnny hardly moves.

ROMAN

So why did you call Johnny?

JOHNNY STORY

Sorry, Johnny's not home right now,

but the pipe is and the pipe says

that Johnny heard you were getting

Roman gives a slight roll of the eyes.

Look, whoever I am talking to please

relay the message to Johnny. His

Shut down a few of our venues and he

intends to shut down a few more unless

Mr Story puts in an appearance.

JOHNNY STORY

Why are you talking to a pipe Roman?

You're madder than I am.

MICKEY

Come back Johnny, come back home.

JOHNNY STORY

But home is where your head is and I

don't feel at home in my head.

Come back Johnny!

Johnny smiles and pulls out a gun from under his arse. He

points it at Roman, waits until he knows they feel it and

pulls the trigger.

It's a lighter. He relights his splif, hot hash dropping on

his chest, he ignores it.

JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)

I bet our Lenny gave you the "I'm

his old man" speech didn't he?

(impersonating Lenny)

I've seen jelly fish with closer DNA

couple of problems with the pipe.

Come on boys, buy us both a cup of

Uri is a man born with nothing, carved

his way up the hard way, he's smart,

young and only one thing will stop

him from reaching his goals,...women.

And this woman has become a problem.

My job is to protect Uri and in this

department he needs protecting, I

don't like her or trust her and I

want you to follow that snake.

We reveal it's CHECHNYAN 1 our war criminal who is looking

battered from the beating the day before.

CHECHNYAN 1

Leave it with me Victor.

We go back to the scene at the restaurant from a different

perspective. The two CHECHNYAN'S see One Two and Handsome

Bob walk out of the restaurant, they two look at one another,

their brows steel.

CUT BACK to present with the music being cut off from One

Two's head phones. He opens his eyes, on his throat lies a

very long and sharp knife. The two CHECHNYANS have entered

the room and pulled the wire out of the machine. CHECHNYAN

1 is sitting on a chair next to One Two, he's the one with

the blade. He smiles, One Two doesn't.

they go in.

The music is very loud, it's Russian. Archy and Danny make

their way to it's source, up the stairs, to the bedroom door.

The base thumps out. Archy tries the handle, it turns, he

pushes the door open slowly. The music becomes clear as we

reveal a horrible scene. Archy is shocked, but a little

amused.

Tied to the bed, back to front with a pillow over his head

is One Two. A large blade is resting on his back, a bottle

of vodka is open on the side, One Two cries and wriggles

uselessly.

He is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from

his military hat. He is "having much fun." His massive

frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two

previously inflicted. The other Chechnyan (similarly

dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all

sorts of horrible looking things. Archy looks on amazed by

the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused.

He hits the "off" button, the Chechnyans spin, looking

distressed. Silence ensues.

Emmm, emmmmmmmmmmmm.

jacket and steals his gun. The two FRIENDS are in shock,

needless to say so is Archy. Johnny holds it on his two

friends.

Archy grabs the gun and hits Johnny on the back of the head,

not too hard.

Johnny comes bowling in like a 'rocknrolla' coming on to

stage. He spots Lenny.

JOHNNY STORY

Sidney!   Nice wheels.

Archy comes in with Danny and the carpets, Handsome Bob hears

this, is Lenny Cole the Sidney Shaw?

JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)

Sorry about the painting, needed the

cash for a little bit of the old

"dusty show bizzzzzzzz."

(beat)

So, it's gone now, lost in the world

of degenerate and stoned no hopers,

never to be seen again by the eye of

a clean soul.

There is a pause while Lenny considers just shooting him.

He changes his tone, he gets serious and slow.

LENNY COLE

Tell me, what are you boy if you are

not poison? Look what you've left

behind you. Your Dad couldn't even

bear the sight ya, no wonder he fucked

off and left me to pick up the pieces,

but that wasn't enough for you was

it? No, had to drive your mum into

a bottle of pills and house full of

nutters. All she got then was a hot

bath a ice cold razor, why?

(beat)

Cos your poison Johnny, that's why.

What can I say,...

(pause)

I'm a junkie, crack head, no gooder,

should never have wasted your money

on that school.

LENNY COLE

Archy get him out of here.

ARCHY

I've had enough of him, I don't trust

myself.

(beat)

Use someone else.

Johnny grabs the back of Lenny's chair and pushes him around

like he's a two year old, Lenny feels a right twit. One

Two, Handsome Bob, and Mumbles observe.

JOHNNY STORY

It's a gathering, I love a gathering

look, Mumbles, One Two, Handsome Bob

all the old faces today.

(beat)

It's all going so well apart from

Archy who's ruining the day. I tried

to cheer him up with that story about

how you grassed him u,...

BANG! Lenny shoots Johnny in the hip with a gun he has kept

hidden. Everybody is shocked, Danny jumps back in horror

that was pretty close.

ROMAN

Whooooa,...

ARCHY

All right calm down, give me that,

I'll take care of him.

Danny moves in to take the gun from Lenny.    Johnny speaks in

pain, but still chipper.

JOHNNY STORY

That wasn't one of your better shots

was it now Daddy. If you want to

shut me up it should have been a bit

higher.

Lenny looks up to Danny.

Danny takes Roman, Mickey and Johnny out towards the elevator.

LENNY COLE (CONT'D)

You don't know how much trouble you

have caused me so please understand

that I will kill you very slowly if

you do not tell me where my money

is.

HANDSOME BOB

The address is in my top pocket.

Here, Archy,...you know I wouldn't

mess you around.

Lenny is out of reach of them, Archy can tell Handsome Bob

is implying something.

HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D)

Take it Arch.

Archy leans forward to take it,      Lenny interrupts wheeling

himself over.

LENNY COLE

Let me have a look first.

He takes the letters out of Handsome Bob's top pocket and

opens them up. He squints, the print is too small he can't

read what it says.

ARCHY

Here you can't read it without your

glasses, let me have a look.

Lenny looks uncomfortable, Archy almost snatches the letters

and flicks through the pages. He reads to himself, could it

be true? Could Lenny be the informer sending everyone around

him down?

LENNY COLE

What does it say?      Hurry,...

over the place. Danny is facing front while another MAN is

keeping an eye on them. We SEE, but the other's don't, Danny

is slowly screwing on a silencer.

JOHNNY STORY (V.O.)

Danny boy is going to turn around

and "pop me" two in the head and one

in throat just to make sure.

And then, since Danny is obviously

going to kill you two as well,...

WE SEE the imaginary shots from Danny's gun go off on Mickey

We see Archy's story acted out in the full court room, Law

and Order style. The judge and lawyer act out Archy's words.

JUDGE

A secret letter stands witness as to

the cooperation and efficiency of

that informer.

LAWYER

An accurate record of his treachery

will be brought in to protect the

informer,...

No, I am being set up.

ARCHY

You're a dirty bastard Sidney, a

very dirty bastard.

Archy grabs the belt that's used to tie up drowning victims,

he throws it round Lenny's chair and stuffs a bit of cloth

into Lenny's wide open mouth.

ARCHY (CONT'D)

(to One Two, Handsome

Bob and Mumbles)

You three, cut yourself free and get

out of here,...

Archy throws a knife across to Mumbles who just catches it

and starts to cut his way out of the ropes. Archy gets back

on with the job at hand. He reads through the names Lenny

has grassed on over the years.

ARCHY (CONT'D)

Michael Finny, ten years. Frazier

Nash, fifteen years. Cousin Ronnie,

six years,..you dirty bastard.

Michael Dexter, eight years.

Archy grabs the winch that lowers victims to their crayfish

death and bangs it on to the back of the wheel chair. He

presses the start button and the wheelchair is raised with

haste.

ARCHY (CONT'D)

The Jew twins, fourteen years and of

course ME, Archy, four years.

One Two, Mumbles, and Handsome Bob are free.

JOHNNY

But now Danny's rattled, he won't be

able to wait because you now know

what's coming, so he's gonna fire.

Danny, who is now in a state because Johnny has predicted

everything he's going to do, suddenly turns with his gun.

Mickey catches it, the force of the stop pulls the trigger,

and the other MANS head is drilled through. Roman joins the

wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at Danny's

head. The trigger gets squeezed and Danny's head also gets

a drilling. Silence. Johnny, who is smothered in blood,

speaks coolly.

JOHNNY STORY

Mickey, pass me the gun.

Mickey is out to lunch, but Johnny sounds commanding.

JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)

MICKEY quickly, pass me that gun in

Dannys hand. Don't worry he can't

defend himself he doesn't have a

head, quickly now. Does this answer

the question that you two so

frequently asked as to why I sought

refuge in the depths and perverse

beauty of the crack pipe?

Get fucking down!

He looks on in horror and points the gun at Johnny. Just as

he's about to fire,..there is a great smash of bone on timber.

Bandy falls to reveal One Two standing there with a large

piece of timber.

ONE TWO

I think we should get out of here

now, don't you John?

At which point in the background WE SEE Lenny being lowered

to his demise. He looks at the group in horror as he is

quickly lowered to his death by drowning and cray fish.

FADE OUT.

I would like to ask you something

personal.

His phone rings, he frowns slightly and answers it.

URI (CONT'D)

Not now Victor, I am busy.

Uri turns. There, casually resting on the floor is his

painting, his lucky painting. Uri's expression changes, his

world has been shattered, he's thinking very ugly thoughts.

He turns back to Stella, dead pan.

URI (CONT'D)

A very nice painting. How long have

you had it?

A little caught off guard.

STELLA

Years, it's my lucky painting,...

it's very special isn't it?
