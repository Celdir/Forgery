"FREUD CHICKEN!"

SHRINK'S VOICE (o.s.)

Back, Stanley...you're going back...back to when

it all began. Are you going back yet? Come on,

get back, ve haven't got all day.

STANLEY (V.O.)

It was third grade. The teacher was Miss

Hudlapp. She was kinda squat and lumpy - she

smelled funny - but she was kind.

MISS HUDLAPP

CLASS!

(turning around suddenly)

How many times have I told you? In this class we

do not pound tenpenny nails into Stanley's head!

STANLEY (V.O.)

You know how some teachers have those, kind of,

flaps on their arms - those big sacks of limp

flab that like, dangle?

STANLEY (V.O.)

It sounds weird...but for some reason, as I

watched those big old flaps of hers, I began to

feel...well...oddly...

STANLEY (V.O.)

...aroused.

(beat)

And then the horror began.

MISS HUDLAPP

Young man. What's that in your lap?

STANLEY (V.O.)

It was useless. Like putting a baseball cap on

the Washington Monument. And then...all at once

...there he was.

STANLEY (V.O.)

Monkeybone!!

MONKEYBONE

Oooo-oo-ooh, baby. I love your way.

STANLEY

How about it, Doc? Can you help me?

SHRINK

Not overnight. These imaginary monkey cases take

time. I vould estimate...roughly...

SHRINK

Twelve years and three months ought to do it.

STANLEY

One question, doc - what did you mean when you

said "imaginary"?

SHRINK

All in good time, my boy. All in good time.

SHRINK

Vot a crackpot! Monkey on ze back - HAH!! ROLL

OUT ZE WACKY WAGON!!

VOICE IN BACKPACK

Imaginary, huh? You quack.

STANLEY

Aw, Monkeybone! At this rate I'll never find a

good shrink.

MONKEYBONE

Those guys are a waste of money! I'll show you

how to stop sucking your thumb...

HERB

Thank you...that's our pilot...the good news is,

Comedy Channel has just picked us up with an

order for six new episodes!

HERB

Now, let's give it up for the guy who started it

all. Creator of America's most disturbed comic

strip...the man behind the monkey...Mister Stu

Miley!

STU

I don't actually draw all the animation, no. We

have sweatshop workers who couldn't get jobs at

Nike doing that.

BEAUTIFUL FAN

Mr. Miley, would you draw Monkeybone on my

belly? As a guide?

STU

Guide...?

BEAUTIFUL FAN

For my tattoo artist?

BEAUTIFUL FAN

Wait! You have to draw the rest of him -

STU

I - I have to, uh, check in with my doctor. DO-

OCCCC!!

STU

Hey, Doc. Come here. There's something really

cool I want to show you.

STU

See these doors? The cool thing is, you go out

...they close...you can't get back in!

JULIE

You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit!

Everyone loves you!

STU

They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.

JULIE

It was you who got the standing O. It was you

drawing on the belly over there...

STU

That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I

don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of

media creeps. I just want to be us. Home. Alone!

(conspiratorially)

I have something I have to give you.

JULIE

Can't you give it to me later?

STU

Yeah, I could, but the thing is, if later got

here sooner, it would be...better.

HERB

Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I

know you don't like the idea, but you really

ought to talk to these guys -

STU

Julie and I - we were just gonna go...

HERB

Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You

got three major toy companies...you got the guys

from Burger God over here...

STU

Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in

the french fries?

HERB

Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre-

emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -

STU

Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.

HERB

Do you know what kind of opportunity you have

here? You gotta strike. I'm talking mansions.

Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you

brush your teeth!

STU

I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!

HERB

Being rich is not a trap. That is a dirty lie

perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures

from killing them.

STU

Herb. I have to go.

HERB

Why?

STU

I got the ring.

(beat)

Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.

HERB

Oh my God...you're proposing?

STU

My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she...

fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never

been. She loves me the way I am - right now.

(beat)

I don't want everything to change. I don't want

her saying yes to some big success. I just want

her saying yes to me.

HERB

...In some weird way I respect that.

HERB

Okay then. If I get you out of here - you pop

the question - tonight. Or else. Get me?

HERB

They're just prototypes...take 'em home and look

at 'em before you say no...

(scanning the streets)

If you could just hold on a minute or two, we're

expecting a couple more trucks.

HERB

Okay, okay! You're a beautiful couple. Go.

STU

Look at this! He won't let us leave!

JULIE

Who?

STU

The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over

both our lives if we let him.

JULIE

Stu - stop it. That monkey is good luck. You

thought him up, and everybody loves him, and

he's probably going to make you rich. So relax!

Enjoy it!

STU

I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had

any good luck, until I met you...what if it's

all just another bad dream?

JULIE

What's the "bad" part?

STU

I might wake up.

JULIE

(laughing; taking his hand)

If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So

face it. You're just going to have to be happy!

STU

I am happy. It just so happens this is the

happiest night of my life.

It's His World. We Just Live in It!

MONKEYBONE

Sunday Nights This Fall

STU

That damn monkey is everywh--

STU

Did we just - hit something?

JULIE

I don't think so.

STU

Are you okay??

STU

Hey! Are you guys all right in there?

TEENAGE GIRL

We're fine.

STU

That stupid monkey banner! It fell on my

windshield - it practically killed us all!

(to JULIE)

God, Julie, if anything had happened to you -

JULIE

I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.

STU

I'd better go report this...

JULIE

Dad's car?

TEENAGE GIRL

What was that? Did you hear that?

JULIE

STU!!

STU

Operator? I want to report an accident.

JULIE

Stu? I'm here, baby. It's me. It's Julie. I love

you. You're gonna be okay, baby, I promise -

JULIE (V.O.)

I'm here, baby. I won't leave you...

STU

Hello? Anybody? - Am I dead?

(beat)

PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF I'M DEAD.

- A bagged copy of Marvel Comics' Conan the Barbarian #1;

- An 8mm reel of highlights from Ray Harryhausen's Jason and the

Argonauts, with swordfighting skeletons on the box cover;

- A SPIRAL NOTEBOOK, its cover labelled "STU M. - GEOGRAPHY," its

inside pages covered with drawings of dinosaurs and airplanes;

- Transparent plastic models of "THE VISIBLE MAN" and his mate, "THE

VISIBLE WOMAN," with a couple of spare organs that young STU never

quite found a place for;

- A vinyl LP of "BREAD'S GREATEST HITS," which STU quickly slips back

into the suitcase lest anyone see it.

RACCOON (o.s.)

Carry your bags, mister?

SNAKE

Cigars, mister? Genuine Coobans!

RABBIT

Wanna meet my sister?

D RK TOWN

SINGING SPHINXES

Weeee...welcome you to Dark Town

And while you're in your coma

This odd amusement park-town

Will be your Home Sweet Homa -

STU

Help me. Please. There's animals. They -

VOICE

Pony ride, Mister?

- JOE CAMEL, doing community service as a STREET SWEEPER -

JOE CAMEL

Hey, Mister. Mister! Got a smoke?

- a YETI selling SNO-CONES from a cart outside the MORPHEUM THEATRE.

The marquee reads:

LIVE! NIGHTMARES! LIVE!

First-Run - Continuous Performances - Popular Prices

Rated NR-H - Not Recommended for Humans

- A CYCLOPS working as a barker at the Penny Arcade;

- A VIDEO RENTAL OUTLET - "BAD DREAMS VIDEO," offering your favorite

nightmares, cult and classic, three nights for $2.95. A THREE-HEADED

DEVIL emerges from the shop carrying a sackful of videos - and

recognizes STU, much to his horror.

HEAD #1

Hey, aren't you Stu Miley?

HEAD #2

We're big fans.

HEAD #3

Could we have your autograph?

BULL (o.s.)

New in town, huh? What're you drinking?

STU

Chasing me - animals - horrible -

BULL

Animals? What kind of animals?

BULL

Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica, right? That's

what everybody says - although personally, I

don't see the resemblance. What are you

drinking?

STU

Uhh - martini?

BULL

Olive or eyeball?

STU

Olive. - Where exactly am I?

BULL

Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.

STU

Stu Miley.

BULL

Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're

quite a celebrity down here.

BULL

I told you, it's the land of nightmares. Same on

every channel...all the stuff people dream,

after they have the extra anchovies.

STU

Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.

BULL

Sad commentary, huh?

DISEMBODIED VOICE (o.s.)

"Bull," huh? That's cute. What's your last name

- "Shit"??

BULL

(turning angrily to STU)

I beg your pardon?

STU

I didn't say anything.

VOICE (o.s.)

Nice face. Lemme guess. You were in a bullfight

...with a Mack Truck!!

STU

I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...

BULL

Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of ventriloquist

here.

VOICE (o.s.)

Well, hello, sailor. Get a lot of dates with

that ding-dong on your face??

MONKEYBONE

Just kiddin', folks! Drinks for everybody -

(pointing at STU)

On him!! HIYA, BOSS!!

CUT TO:

NURSE

Just a spike, ma'am. It happens. It's perfectly

natural with coma patients.

JULIE

I'm a doctor too. I know this man's brain -

DOCTOR

Go home, Doctor. Rest. Come back when you can do

us some good.

WOMAN'S VOICE

Julie?

ALICE

Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.

JULIE

Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and

a half. Let me get some food...

ALICE

Special occasion?

JULIE

I don't know. I guess it was...

ALICE

Don't get all poignant. We're keeping this

bottle on ice. When he comes around you're going

to need it.

ALICE

Who did this?

JULIE

Stu. That was right about the time we met.

ALICE

When he first came in to the sleep lab?

JULIE

Yeah...before your time.

ALICE

Jesus, honey...he always joked about you curing

him, but I never realized what you cured him

from.

JULIE

He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years.

The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start

right in painting...

(chuckling)

That boy looked like pluperfect hell.

ALICE

How do you get from here - to there?

JULIE

Switch hands.

ALICE

What?

JULIE

I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction -

right brain and left brain out of balance. He

was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil

to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.

ALICE

Monkeybone?

JULIE

Left-handed, he was funny. He'd been doing all

this scary, intense work...then he found out he

could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he

liked that.

(shrugging)

And then the nightmares just...stopped.

ALICE

Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one

did you fall in love with?

JULIE

I've put a ton of work into that boy, Alice. I

am not going to let him get away from me.

JULIE

Kimmy...?

KIMMY

Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby

brother...

JULIE

When'd you get in?

KIMMY

An hour ago.

(gathering herself)

I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he

would be like, like this. I can't even bear to

look at him... How about you? You're okay?

JULIE

I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.

KIMMY

I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At

least he had a chance to give you the ring.

JULIE

The ring...

KIMMY

Grandmama's ring. The engagement ring. He asked

me to send it to him -

VOICE FROM BEHIND

Mrs. Brewster? Julie? I'm Dr. Edelstein.

DR. EDELSTEIN

Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.

KIMMY

Can you give us a realistic sense of my

brother's chances?

DR. EDELSTEIN

He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait

and see.

KIMMY

But these...machines are what's keeping him

alive, is that right?

DR. EDELSTEIN

At the moment, yes.

KIMMY

Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long

this is going to last?

DR. EDELSTEIN

Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today,

tomorrow, a month from now...

KIMMY

Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr.

Edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of

doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -

JULIE

Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He

doesn't even know he's in a -

KIMMY

Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our

father took a long time to die. A long time. It

just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a

pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let

it drag out.

JULIE

It's too soon even to - talk about that!

KIMMY

Give me a date, Doctor.

DR. EDELSTEIN

Three months.

(pause)

There's always some brain damage. But at three

months...the chances of coming back shrink

dramatically with every day.

KIMMY

I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can

certainly give it...three months.

DISSOLVE TO:

EMCEE

And now the last of our five finalists...Miss

Michigan...GEORGE T. WILLOUGHBY!

EMCEE

And now George will give us his analysis of

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle as it

pertains to third-world economics!!

GEORGE

I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair!

BULL

Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good

humiliation nightmare.

STU

Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three

months since the accident - and I'm no closer to

going home than I was then.

BULL

Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.

STU

I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting,

and the carnival rides, and watching people's

nightmares. And of course, I need not add -

MONKEYBONE

Thank you, thank you for that very modest

response. I know you're all in comas, but still.

And now...it's dedication time!

MONKEYBONE

We've got a special dedication tonight. This

one's from my ever-lovin' boss, Mr. Stu Mopey -

I mean Miley - and we're sendin' it up to

a very special lady in the land of the living.

Yes, I do mean Julie - the beautiful Miss Julie

- who, if she has a brain in her head, is

shacked up right now with some good-lookin' doc

she met in the E.R.!

(pointing at STU)

JUST KIDDING, BUDDY! Because if we know anything

about Miss Julie, we know she is faithful,

loyal, and true. Even if her boyfriend is an

eggplant. Which is why we're dedicating...this

very special tune...to her. Jumbo?

MONKEYBONE

MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky! UNHH!

MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky! UNHH!

STU

You have humiliated me in public for the last

time.

MONKEYBONE

I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm

just a figment of your imagination.

STU

Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!

MONKEYBONE

Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a

masochistic pain freak. You gotta love me.

STU

I am not. And I don't gotta.

MONKEYBONE

You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could

both be gettin' some o' this fine local action.

It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town,

under five minutes, and in a coma don't count.

STU

Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of

them aren't even my species.

MONKEYBONE

Hellooooooooo, Kitty.

KITTY

Hiya, Stu. Refill on that martini?

MONKEYBONE

I'd like something with an umbrella in it and a

really smutty name. Like a...Sex Behind the Sofa

with Your Parents in the Same Room Watching "The

Brady Bunch."

STU

Nothing for him! He's being repressed.

KITTY

Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.

MONKEYBONE

Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just

wishin' he was me.

STU

I've been trying to get through to the head guy

- the nightmare god - what's his name?

KITTY

Hypnos?

STU

Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I

wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think

I'll never see her again.

STU

I shoulda proposed, Kitty. That way at least

she'd know how I feel. That way she'd...wait for

me.

KITTY

She is waiting for you, Stu. I know she is. Guys

like you don't come along that often. Believe

me, I know.

MONKEYBONE

My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us

boldly go where no man has gone before.

STU

(trying to ignore him)

I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?

KITTY

I mean it, Stu. You're one in a million.

STU

I'm not so special. I'm just - kind of -

MONKEYBONE

Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done

the same if you had the equipment!

STU

THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!

MONKEYBONE

FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -

MONKEYBONE

I'm reportin' this to my union!!

STU

What union?

MONKEYBONE

The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the

Boy Wonder. You top bananas better watch your

ass!

MONKEYBONE

DIVE! DIVE!!

MONKEYBONE

I left my phone number in your undies. Try not

to lose it in traffic.

STU

Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke

my monkey.

MONKEYBONE

Him. Whew. About time!

REAPER

EARL BIEGLER. I'VE COME -

EARL

Can't hear you, young fellow. Speak up!

REAPER

EARL BIEGLER, I'VE COME TO GIVE YOU - aw, hell.

Here.

BULL

An E-Ticket!

PATRON

He got a reprieve.

KITTY

Good for him! He's gonna wake up!

STU

No. No. Not him.

EARL

So long, suckers! See you in the funny papers!

STU

He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How

come he goes back and I stay here?

MONKEYBONE

Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?

STU

(turning abruptly)

HEY!! HEY, YOU!!

STU

He got an E-ticket. Where's mine? When do I get

to wake up??

MONKEYBONE

Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.

STU

I've been stuck down here for months. Somebody

had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna

- I'm gonna kick ass!

MONKEYBONE

Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.

REAPER

SORRY, BUD. OFF-DUTY.

MONKEYBONE

Stu? Stu? Let's calm down, talk things over. How

about some comedy relief? Okay. Brontosaurus

walks into a gay bar...

STU/MONKEYBONE

(in unison - impressed)

Damn.

MONKEYBONE

Stu? Stu? I think weve got this backwards. Your

behavior...is disturbing me.

STU

That's right. Run! And don't come back unless

you've got my e-ticket!!

STU

Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna get out of

here. I'll never see her again.

MESSENGER BOY

Miley? Stu Miley?

YOU Are Invited to a

PAJAMA PARTY

at HYPNOS' HIDEAWAY

Penthouse Suite - 10 PM Sharp

"If You Snooze, You Lose"

STU

Hypnos! The god of nightmares! Do you know what

this means, Monkeybone? He's finally going to

hear my case. I'm going home!

DISSOLVE TO:

JULIE

I think we can go another day without shaving.

Long as you don't look like you're growing one

of those stupid little goatees.

JULIE

Hey, there's an article about the Monkeybone

show. They've run that one episode about eight

times now. Herb says it gets higher ratings

every time...they're hoping you'll give 'em some

new material soon...

(long, bored pause)

Wanna hear another joke?

JULIE

Okay...let me see...here we go. A plane full of

explorers crashlands in New Guinea; they are

captured by a cannibal tribe and taken to the

chief's hut, where...wait a minute. I know this

one...

(reading ahead)

You stinker! You swiped this joke for a

Monkeybone strip!

JULIE

Okay. Let's try again. Why did the pervert cross

the road?

JULIE

Kimmy! What's the matter?

KIMMY

This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but

it's been three months now, and...

(long pause)

I gave the order.

FADE THROUGH TO:

MONKEYBONE

Now this...is livin'.

MONKEYBONE

Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can

paint better than that.

STU

Like you'd know. You started out on the back of

a napkin, you little...doodle.

MONKEYBONE

Hey! Like the do. So tell me, are you a, uhh...

natural snakehead?

GORGON

Only fifty dollars to find out.

MONKEYBONE

Fifty dollars?! Bite me!

GORGON

You got it, big boy.

STU

Say, have you seen Mr. Hypnos?

HAND WOMAN

Hyp? He was here a while ago. Aren't you Stu

Miley? The nightmare guy?

HAND WOMAN

I heard you were going to be here tonight. This

is so cool!

HAND WOMAN

You fat slob! Watch what you're doing!

JUMBO

Why don't you slap me? Go on, slap me!

HAND WOMAN

Come on, Stu. Let's go where the real fun is.

STU

Wow. Live feed, huh?

HAND WOMAN

You bet. Hyp gets all the best stuff before it

goes out to the theatres.

SLUG WITH A MAN'S HEAD

HEY!

STU

Sorry.

HAND WOMAN

Shh! There's a new one just starting.

STU

That - that's me.

CYCLOPS

Nice shirt, dude!

STU

What is this? Who's dreaming this??

(beat)

Julie??

YETI

Hey, keep it down!

STU

JULIE!!

HAND WOMAN

Stu!! What are you doing? Chill out!!

JULIE

No. No. STU!

STU

JULIE! I'M HERE, DOC! DON'T LET THEM PULL THE

PLUG! I'M HERE!!!

CYCLOPS

HEY! Watch it, you stinkin' gringo -

STU

JULIE! I'M HERE! I LOVE YOU!

JULIE

Stu? STU...?

JULIE

STU!!!!

JUMBO

Who invited this schmuck, anyway?

HAND WOMAN

Oh, it's my fault. I thought he was cooler than

that.

STU

Listen. Please. It's my girlfriend. I've gotta

get a message to her...

WOMAN'S VOICE

HYP!!!

MONKEYBONE

I knew I left it in there somewhere.

HYPNOS

Haw! I like a monkey with vision!

MONKEYBONE

You said it, partner!

STU

How'd you get in there?

MONKEYBONE

Stu... It's a party.

STU

Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -

HYPNOS

Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls

...Mr. Stu Miley, in the house!

(leading a round of applause)

This is an honor. We see a lot of nightmares

down here, but yours are like caviar, man. You

da shits!!

STU

Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was

having it. She dreamed they were pulling the

plug on me. She was watching me die.

HYPNOS

Uh huh. And?

STU

Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to

let her know I'm okay. Until I can get out of

here...

STU

...which is actually what I wanted to talk to

you about. See, I've been here three months -

HYPNOS

Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?

STU

Tell me what?

HYPNOS

It's a special kind of party. A farewell party.

Do you...get what I'm saying?

STU

Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -

STU

I'M GOING HOME! I'M WAKING UP! HEY, EVERYBODY!

I'M OUTTA HERE. I...

STU

I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or

don't I get to... Is there some...

HYPNOS

Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this

pact with your sister...no life support?

MONKEYBONE

Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??

STU

Well - yeah - but that doesn't...apply. It was

different then. I was depressed. My life is

great now. I'm in love!

MONKEYBONE

Pull the plug! Pull the plug! Take my organs! I

don't need 'em! I don't need no! Life support!

I'm an idiot! Pull the pl--

STU

Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...

HYPNOS

Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide.

That's why she was having the nightmare.

(an embarrassed shrug)

They're pulling the plug at nine AM.

STU

Nine AM! But that's - twelve hours.

MONKEYBONE

I'm so dumb! I deserve to die -

STU

Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you.

There's gotta be something I can do.

HYPNOS

Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work,

but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's

bailiwick.

STU

Maybe you could talk to Death!

HYPNOS

Me? Me, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will

be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before

I go crawling to that piece of -

HYPNOS

Now Death is not what you would call a people

person, like me. Death is a putz - and I should

know. I'm his little brother.

STU

You're Death's brother?

HYPNOS

Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My-

Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the

course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired

of that schtick.

(spreading his hands)

So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down

amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it.

I'm supposed to be grateful?

MONKEYBONE

The penthouse is pretty swank, though.

HYPNOS

Thank you. I decorated it myself.

STU

Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have

eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...

HYPNOS

Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's one thing you

might try. Only one guy in history ever pulled

it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there

was that other guy who...well, very few people

have done it.

STU

Hyp, I'll do anything.

MONKEYBONE

Me too. And I mean anything. Ask the chicks in

the back room.

HYPNOS

You've seen those E-tickets, right? Well, what

you gotta do...is go into the Land of Death...

and steal an E-ticket right out from under

Death's nose.

STU

Land of Death. How do I get there?

HYPNOS

Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying. And you

didn't hear it from me.

HYPNOS

You've heard of a fate worse than Death? That's

what's waiting for you if you screw up.

MONKEYBONE

Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real,

boss, but I gotta go buff up my resume. ANYBODY

HERE NEED A FIGMENT?

STU

Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the

land of Death alone.

MONKEYBONE

Stu, you have my absolute confidence. - DEAD

MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!

STU

(grabbing him by the throat)

I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and

I'm gonna take it - with or without you.

MONKEYBONE

Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?

STU

No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.

MONKEYBONE

You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on

your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick.

For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter -

(wrapping himself around STU's leg)

It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death!

Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!

STU

All right. You can come.

MONKEYBONE

OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH--

(suddenly realizing)

Something went very, very wrong here.

STU

Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.

REAPER

LULU LA RUE. I HAVE COME FOR YOU.

REAPER

LULU LA RUE, I HAVE COME FOR -

LULU

Shay, you're kinda cute.

FRED

Say there. How 'bout one for the road?

FRED

Hold this for me, pally.

FRED

Ooopsy daisy.

MONKEYBONE

Is that what they call "death with dignity"?

MONKEYBONE

Two words for you, my friend: club soda.

STU

He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So

all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride!

(beat)

Stop shaking! I'll protect you.

MONKEYBONE

Oh, sure. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be

Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?

STU

Where'd he go??

MONKEYBONE

I don't know.

DISSOLVE TO:

JULIE

Six hours. That's when they pull the plug.

That's how long we've got to wake him up.

(beat)

Now these are Stu's old charts from five years

ago, when he first came to the sleep lab...

JULIE

...they show incredibly intense nightmare

activity. The chart below is his new chart...

HUTCH

Holy shit.

JULIE

He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop.

(beat)

Anybody here know what Oneirix is?

CLARISSA

Sure - it's an enzyme. The brain secretes it

during violent dream activity...

HUTCH

It's nightmare juice. Julie and I were on the

team that learned to synthesize it. If those

charts are right, Stu's swimming in the stuff.

(puzzled)

Are you thinking we can decrease the levels?

JULIE

No. I want to give him more. I want to give him

a massive dose.

HUTCH

That's not going to stop his nightmare -

JULIE

I don't want to stop the nightmare, Hutch. I

want to crank it up. I want to take it right off

the charts. I want to scare him awake.

JULIE

All right! We have a plan. Let's move!

HUTCH

You know, Julie, even if this works - which it

probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't

know what it'll do to his brain.

JULIE

What'll it do if they pull the plug?

DISSOLVE TO:

REAPER

Batch of souls - just back from Processing.

DEATH'S ASSISTANT

Put them over there with the others.

DEATH'S ASSISTANT

Your Grimness? We have a new shipment -

DEATH (o.s.)

Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'll get to it...

DEATH

Last Days of Pompeii...now there was a Great

Moment in Death.

DEATH'S ASSISTANT

If I may point out...it is 12:05...

DEATH

I can't believe - oh, man, I - SINATRA!! Do you

know how long I've been waiting for this?

DEATH'S ASSISTANT

Make that 12:07, your bleakness...the dispatch

team is waiting...

DEATH

Okay, okay, send 'em in. Jeez.

ASSISTANT

Chakasandra Singh, New Delhi. Snakebite.

ASSISTANT

Mulrooney, Lavinia P., Dearborn, Michigan. Head

crushed in a pants press.

DEATH

YOU!!!

DEATH

You're the customer, okay? You're about to die.

It's a big occasion. A formal occasion. And as

you shuffle off this mortal coil, the last thing

your eyes behold is a Grim Reaper covered

with...

(sputtering)

What the hell is that??

STU                                 MONKEYBONE

Cranberry Margarita.                Sex on the Beach.

DEATH

...What??

STU                                 MONKEYBONE

Salty Dog.                          Sufferin' Bastard.

DEATH

Well - whatever it is - you get that shroud to

the dry cleaner ASAP! Now where were we?

ASSISTANT

Clarke P. Devereaux, San Francisco.

Complications resulting from coma...

DEATH

Oh, wait. Says here he's supposed to recover.

DEATH

Take this to Dark Town. Sad to say, he's gonna

live another forty years.

(a consoling pat on the shoulder)

Sorry. Nobody said this job would be easy.

MONKEYBONE

Say, Death, just out of curiosity, could we

maybe swap jobs with that other guy? See, we've

been meaning to drop in on Dark Town - I mean

I've been meaning to...

DEATH

...I beg your pardon?

MONKEYBONE

I got relatives there. I...EEP!!

DEATH

Now what were you saying?

STU/MONKEYBONE

(in unison)

Nothing.

DEATH

I'd like to have a word with you in private.

DEATH

IMPOSTORS!! GET 'EM!!

DEATH

HYPNOS! That little twerp! He's the one who put

you up to this!

MONKEYBONE

Yowie.

DEATH

Head. HEAD!!

MONKEYBONE

Stu...Stu...

STU

IT'S NOT WORKING.

MONKEYBONE

There's a thing here! There's a switch!

MONKEYBONE

Stu...LOOK!

STU

What?

MONKEYBONE

Isn't that Lulu?

DEATH

Now we've got 'em.

MONKEYBONE

Weren't we just here?

MONKEYBONE

What'd I tell you? You go to the Land of Death,

wear a jockstrap!

JULIE

What's the maximum safe dose?

ALICE

Most we've ever used is half a CC.

JULIE

Five CC's.

MONKEYBONE

This ain't my nightmare!

DISSOLVE TO:

STU

You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've

made it without you.

MONKEYBONE

Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.

STU

It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like

there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's

gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay

when I'm gone?

MONKEYBONE

Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.

STU

You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure

wish I could take you home with me.

MONKEYBONE

Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well,

there's a new twist.

STU

Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I

really do love y--

MONKEYBONE

Love you too. Boss.

STU

Stop! Monkeybone! Please!!

STU

NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET!

HE'S GOT MY -

HYPNOS

Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got

big plans for that body of yours!

STU

NO! JULIE! NO-O-O-O!

STU

EEEEEEPP!!

STU

Oooie! That smarts!!!

JULIE

Stu?

STU

Julie?... Hey, you are a looker.

NURSE

It's a miracle. It's a miracle.

DOCTOR

Two more ticks of the clock...

JULIE

Thank you. Thank you for coming back to me.

STU-BONE

Boy, I don't know about you guys, but I'm

starving.

WIPE TO:

RAT GUARD (o.s.)

Heads up! Feeding time!

STU

Who are y-- WHAT DO YOU WANT??

GENGHIS KHAN

Dinner.

STU

Alfred Hitchcock??

EDGAR ALLAN POE

A fat bastard, but damn quick on his feet.

TYPHOID MARY

That's how he keeps his girlish figure.

STEPHEN KING

Gotta move fast in this crowd, or you'll starve.

Here you go, pal. Have some popcorn.

STU

What is this stuff?

STEPHEN KING

They feed us the slops from the Morpheum

Theatre. You hope for Jujubes, settle for

goobers. - I'm Steve. Steve King.

STU

Stephen King? What are you doing in here?

JACK THE RIPPER

I'm Jack the Ripper.

TYPHOID MARY

Typhoid Mary.

ATILLA THE HUN

Atilla the Hun. Trade you a Twizzler for a box

STU

Atilla the - ! What in hell is this place?

RAT GUARD

All hail the most glorious! Most eminent! Most

esteemed all-powerful God of Sleep...his Royal

Lassitude -

HYPNOS

Enough, enough, I'm hung over.

TYPHOID MARY

Hyp! Did you bring me the cough medicine?

STEPHEN KING

Did you remember the night light I asked for?

EDGAR ALLAN POE

King, you pussy.

STEPHEN KING

Bite me, Poe! I hate waking up in the dark.

HYPNOS

Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new

guest settling in - ?

STU

YOU SET ME UP!!

HYPNOS

Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It

ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets.

Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and

that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?

STU

Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?

HYPNOS

It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of

'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy

up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker!

Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been

doing this all the way back to Atilla and

Genghis Khan!

STU

But why me? Why'd you pick on me??

HYPNOS

The monkey, of course. It was his idea.

STU

Monkeybone...!?

HYPNOS

Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day

he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help

him get your body...in return he gives us all

the nightmares we want.

STU

You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he

gonna do - draw really scary cartoons??

HYPNOS

Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that

girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical

basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a

big old batch of nightmare juice!

HYPNOS

Oh, we're predicting a record box-office. It's

like I always say...nightmares are your best

entertainment!

KIMMY

I just couldn't stand the thought of you

suffering. I love you so, I would never have...

forgive me, Stu. Please forgive me.

STU-BONE

Kimmy. Chill. We've still got a pact. If

anything ever happens to you, I'll be right

there to return the favor.

(baring his teeth)

So drive carefully! From now on.

JULIE

Welcome home.

JULIE

Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.

STU-BONE

Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting

something a little swankier. How much loot does

old Stu rake in, anyway?

STU-BONE

Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself.

You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty

lucrative franchise...

JULIE

Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for

a minute. I'll be right back.

JULIE

Here's to a bottle...we should have opened...

three months ago.

STU-BONE

Bitchin' good cake.

JULIE

Stu, are you...feeling okay?

STU-BONE

Sure. Why?

JULIE

You're acting kind of...odd.

STU-BONE

(grabbing another fistful)

In what way?

JULIE

Buster! Look who's here!

STU-BONE

Oh shit, the cake!

STU-BONE

Mine. Get back! MINE!!

variety of -

What are you watching?

STU-BONE

Ohhh, nothing.

JULIE

You sure this is...medically advisable?

STU-BONE

Got a doctor on duty.

JULIE

Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -

JULIE

(glancing downward)

- which it seems to be.

JULIE

Oh, God!! Baby! Are you -

STU

How was it? I don't recall.

JULIE

It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.

DISSOLVE TO:

STU

I'm not like the rest of you. I'm just a regular

guy! I'm not a "nightmare maker."

RASPUTIN

Neither are we. We got our bodies hijacked just

like you. The guys who replaced us are the

nightmare makers!

ATTILA

Like me. I was a mess sergeant in the Mongol

Horde. I never wanted to be the Scourge of Asia.

I just wanted a new recipe for yak!

JACK THE RIPPER

I was Jack the Haberdasher.

STU

But how? Did you all have sidekicks? Figments?

...Monkeys??

STEPHEN KING

Hey, I got screwed over by my own dog. Go

through hell to get that E-ticket, and who winds

up in my body? That darn Cujo.

RASPUTIN

He's sure got a thing for those icy blondes.

RAT GUARD

Miley. You got a visitor.

STU

...Kitty?!?

KITTY

I'm so sorry, Stu. I wanted to tell you what was

going on. I really, really liked you.

STU

Kitty...my situation is really not important.

The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with,

and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.

KITTY

You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck

in this place, and only thinking of her.

STU

Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her

what Monkeybone is up to??

RAT GUARD

Time's up! Break it up, you two.

KITTY

No! Give me a moment. Just to look at him. Oh,

Stu. Oh, my sweet, sweet Stu.

RAT GUARD

Feeding time!

DISSOLVE TO:

STU-BONE

Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just kills me!

JULIE

I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure

you'll be okay?

STU-BONE

Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get.

"Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a

big story! That's front page news! But I can't

find a word of coverage in this stinkin' rag!

(shuffling through the paper)

Hey. Don't I have a TV show?

JULIE

They only made the one episode. They've shown it

about nineteen times.

STU-BONE

I need a new PR guy.

WIPE TO:

STU-BONE

Yes, being in a coma taught Stu Miley a thing or

two about life. Buckle your seat belts, for one.

But seriously, Stu Miley is a different man

today. I'm much homier.

STU-BONE

And speaking of which, here's the light of my

life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.

JULIE

I had to park two blocks away. Is something -

STU

I took the liberty of calling a little press

conference. We're on TV, so don't say "shit."

(covering his mouth)

Shit! I said it. Shit! I said it again!

REPORTER

Stu, what is it about Monkeybone that makes him

so popular?

STU-BONE

Well, it's partly that he punctures all the

phony pretensions of our modern society...and

it's partly that he's a breathtakin',

heartbreakin', rump-shakin' sex machine!

(beat)

Ask these gentlemen here. They're an important

cog in my media machine. They'll be doing six

new episodes of the Monkeybone show under my

personal supervision.

STU-BONE

It's all synergy. The show synergizes the strip,

which synergizes the merchandising, which

synergizes the religion, which synergizes the

Barbara Walters special; and then, baby, we are

all in the United Empire of Monkeybonia.

HERB

I tell you, he's ready to merchandise. We've

gotta move quickly. Get the toy guys, the burger

guys, the lunchbox guys -

JULIE

Herb...what in God's name -

JULIE

What's this about merchandising? You always

hated merchandising!

STU-BONE

Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another

angle...there's a potload of money here.

DISSOLVE TO:

HYPNOS

You two-bit simian stooge. WHAT THE HELL IS

THIS? We didn't send you up here to shake your

booty and chase broads. We sent you up to make

nightmares!!

HYPNOS

Now find that nightmare juice and get to work.

'Cause you may be a free man during the day...

but when you dream, your monkey ass is mine!

STU-BONE

Eep!

STU-BONE

Friggin' Hypnos. I'll show him...

FEMALE BABOON

Hey, handsome.

FEMALE BABOON

Yeah, you. Come here, good-looking.

(beat)

Why don't you let me out of this cage?

STU-BONE

Hey, I'd love to, baby, but...it'd put me in hot

water.

FEMALE BABOON

(caressing his chin)

I know how to be very, very grateful.

STU-BONE

Tell you what, angel. When you get out, give me

a call...

JANITOR

Gettin' jiggy wit' it - gettin' jiggy wit' it...

JULIE

Stu? Is that you? Where did you go?

STU-BONE

Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.

JULIE

Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.

STU-BONE

Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.

JULIE

You're wearing a topcoat, Stu. - Where are your

pants?

STU-BONE

Well, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I

wouldn't need any pants. Now would I?

BURGER GOD REP

As you know, Burger God has 1700 outlets

nationwide...we're prepared to back a major TV

buy to launch our Mega Monkey Meal.

(beat)

Go ahead. Try a bite.

HERB

What's the matter?

STU-BONE

I think it's a pig hair.

(examining a contract)

How much is McDonald's offering?

HERB

Less.

HERB

Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking

off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if

you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.

STU-BONE

How much?

HERB

Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could

probably get People and Entertainment Tonight to

cover it.

STU-BONE

I get it. We could give the public the

impression that we were doing something...

charitable. Brilliant!!

HERB

And last...you remember Bill here, from the

Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something

I think you'll like.

BAZOOM TOY REP

It's a prototype. Code name "Little Jack

Horner." Go on - pull out his thumb.

BAZOOM TOY REP

You know kids - they love anything gross...

STU-BONE

Kids? Kids?! This is a work of genius. This is

art. This is the answer to all my prayers!

(beat)

Say - just a technical question - could you fill

these babies up with a particulate solution of

one part chemical enzyme to ten parts water?

BAZOOM EXEC

Well - I guess...

STU-BONE

Aww righhhhht!

STU

So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo

benefit. We get a big pinata. We fill it with

Monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em.

HERB

A pinata. That's a great idea!

STU-BONE

You guys don't know it, but you just saved my

ass!

BURGER GOD EXEC

Interesting fellow.

HERB

Head trauma.

STU-BONE

This'll get him off my back!

ANNOUNCER

It's his world - we just live in it. Monkeybone!

Back with six all-new episodes, starting -

JULIE

The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's

acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to

be.

ALICE

Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.

JULIE

I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure

it did. It's as if...he's not Stu any more. The

Stu I love is gone!

(beat)

He spends all his time in the garage. He says

he's...autographing.

STU-BONE

Yeah, baby! Nightmare-in-a-butt!

(looking around)

Okay...guinea pig, guinea pig...

STU-BONE

C'mere, boy...c'mere, ole buddy...

ALICE

Listen. Let's bring him in for some tests. I

guarantee you're overreacting.

JULIE

Actually, no, I don't think I'm overreacting.

STU-BONE

KREEEGAHHHH!!!

STU-BONE

Sweet dreams, you little bastard!

HYPNOS

Dog dreams!! That stinkin' monkey. I can't

believe it. We give him a body, and he sends us

...dogs.

KITTY

Let's not think about dogs. Let's think about

pussycats. Meeowwwwwwrrrr....

KITTY

Shh! You'll need it when you're traveling.

KITTY

Don't ask where I got it.

STU

You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!

KITTY

You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You

find a way back to that girl of yours and make

her happy.

STU

How am I gonna get past the guards?

KITTY

I'll worry about the guards.

(loudly)

OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.

KITTY

Go. Just go.

STU

Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--

I'll really...never...forget you.

CLARISSA

Great lead. I'll try and find it on the net.

HUTCH

Seems perfectly obvious. He's been possessed by

a monkey!

HERB

You're really gonna pop the question?

STU-BONE

Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as

they break that pinata, we'll grab a cab - and

it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.

HERB

I can't believe you. You used to hate being the

center of attention. Now you're proposing, in

public, at a benefit.

STU-BONE

Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity

now, do I really want to get married? But on the

other hand, if you're married, they can't

testify against you.

JULIE

Hello? Oh, Hutch - what?

HUTCH

The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody

switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!

JULIE

Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -

JULIE

Okay. Call the police. I'll be right over.

JULIE

The technical name is Oneirix. It's an enzyme.

It's present in the brains of -

DETECTIVE

(cutting her off; writing)

Yeah, yeah...Nightmare juice.

DETECTIVE II

And there's been no sign of a break-in?

HUTCH

Holy shit...the pants.

The janitor found a pair of torn-up pants. It

was the same night the monkey tipped her cage

over. Remember that, Julie?

JULIE

(suddenly afraid)

Yeah...I remember it vividly.

WIPE TO:

DEATH

Now, if I may ask - what kind of idiot sneaks

into the Land of Death twice?

STU

You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to

be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both

mad at Hypnos.

DEATH

Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all

his idea. You were completely innocent -

STU

I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E-

ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare you right

in the face to get it - and I'd do the same

again.

DEATH

Why??

STU

I have a girl up there. And I never - I

should've - I just want to tell her I love her.

DEATH

I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I enjoy

my job. Why does everyone want to make it

difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching

bodies...it is so irresponsible.

STU

Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my

soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me

just one lousy hour.

DEATH

Well - you'd need a body.

DEATH

If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I

wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is

darned hard to come by.

(chortling)

That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake

out of the urinal - I thought I would die.

STU

Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.

DEATH

De nada. Now, come here...bend over...before I

change my mind.

STU

Bend over?

SURGEON

Okay...detaching the left kidney...

ORGAN DONOR

What the - who the hell am I??

SURGEON

You're an organ donor!

ORGAN DONOR

Am I dead?!?

SURGEON

The chute didn't open. We kind of assumed -

ORGAN DONOR

I need this body. Just for a few minutes. I'll

bring it back, okay?

DOCTOR

(eyeing the pancreas)

Might have someone take a look at that.

O.D. STU

Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

LEAD SURGEON

I think it can still be saved. Put it on ice.

O.D. STU (o.s.)

DOC? DOC?? - JULIE?

JULIE

Whatever he's done, I'm responsible for it.

CLARISSA

That's not true, Julie. It's not true.

ALICE

This is not about your guilt, Julie. There could

be innocent people in danger.

CLARISSA

He's not the same guy. He's not your Stu.

(beat)

I didn't want to tell you this, but the other

day he pinched me on the butt.

ALICE

I didn't want to tell you this, but the other

day he tried to mount me from behind! Look, you

have to tell the police.

JULIE

Tell them what? I don't know anything concrete.

All I have is a feeling.

CLARISSA

Oh my God, we've got a flasher.

JULIE

That...that's Herb!

As emcee I want to thank you all for joining us

at this swingin' bash...it's a special night for

the birds, and the lions, and the monkeys, but

it's also a special night for -

(tapping his chest)

- this monkey. And it's special because of a

very special lady. Her name is -

(checking a note in his pocket)

Julie McElroy. Just kiddin', Julie. Stand up.

STU-BONE

And to make this special night extra-special,

I'd like to do a special number...especially for

you.

STU-BONE

I am just a Monkey Man! I'm glad you are a

monkey...woman...too.

(soft voice)

How about it, Julie?

STU-BONE

We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony.

An Abba Dabba honeymoon!

JULIE

It looks so...new.

STU-BONE

It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?

JULIE

But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's

ring...

STU-BONE

Heirloom? Huh? You want a used ring - ?

STU-BONE

Ju-leeee... Operators are standing by... Offer

expires at midnight, December 31...

O.D. STU

DOC! DOC! DON'T DO IT! HE ISN'T STU! HE'S

MONKEYBONE!!!

STU-BONE

Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep

call you - ?

JULIE

He called me "Doc."

GUEST

HEY MONKEYBONE!!

STU-BONE

That's me, folks! Monkeybone! Let's party!

JULIE

Please. Where did you take that man...?

JULIE

Who are you? Why did you say those things?

O.D. STU

Oh, Doc, it's all a mixup. We were in the land

of death. He stole my e-ticket. That's how he

got my body, see? All they had left for me was

this corpse!

O.D. STU

Don't walk away, Doc! He's only here to give

people nightmares!

(no response)

Doc! Please! Don't you remember the dream? They

were pulling the plug - I called out to you -

and you heard me. Remember?

JULIE

BUSTER?!?

JULIE

Stu...how?

O.D. STU

I had to come back, Julie. I had to give you

this.

O.D. STU

I meant to give it to you before. The night we

crashed. I was so happy, Julie, I...try to

remember me like that, okay? Not like this.

JULIE

What's wrong?

O.D. STU

I'm crying too. I just don't have any tears. I'm

all dried up.

ALICE

Detective, please let this man out of the van.

STU-BONE

Okay, folks, it's pinata time - you know the

rules - five bucks a pop - and remember, it's

all for the benefit of our friends the animals!

(eyes brightening)

Oooooh! This one's on me!

STU-BONE

Choke up, baby. That's right. Choke up!

ORGANIZER

I don't understand, officer. This is a benefit.

Surely this can wait until -

COP

Sorry, ma'am...we need to question Mr. Miley on

a most urgent matter.

JULIE

Stop this. Now. Those dolls have been tampered

with. They're toxic!

O.D. STU

MONKEYBONE...BACK IN THE PACK.

O.D. STU

I mean it this time. Back in the pack.

STU-BONE

Stu...I can explain...I was sick of being a

figment, see? It's awful being a figment. It's

degrading! And I never really wanted to give

people nightmares. I just told 'em that so

they'd help me get a body.

O.D. STU

Yeah - my body. Back in the pack, you simian

shitbird!

COP

Ma'am, can you give me some idea of what's going

on here?

STU-BONE

Laugh, damn you...laugh at the sidekick...the

happy little monkey. He doesn't have any

feelings. He's just a figment of your

immagination!

STU-BONE

GIMME THAT GODDAM BAT!

COP

HE'S GETTING AWAY!

O.D. STU

I LOVE YOU!

JULIE

STU!!

HEAD SURGEON

LOOK! IT'S HIM!

STU-BONE

Let...go...you...dingleberry...

HEAD SURGEON

Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved!

HEAD SURGEON

Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved.

HEAD SURGEON

Put him on ice. I think he can still be saved!

HYPNOS

Not again. THAT STINKING MONKEY!!!

COP

I think I can bring 'em down.

STU

DEATH!!

DEATH

I dress up when I want to make an impression. -

So how'd it go?

STU

Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye,

everything's gonna be okay.

(shrugging)

I guess I'm yours now.

MONKEYBONE

Death, I'd like to point out that none of this

was my fault. The roots of this tragedy go back

to a callous, uncaring society that -

STU

Hey. Where's Monkeybone?

DEATH

Back in your head, where he belongs.

(beat)

No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda

vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without

him.

STU

Back? You're sending me back?

DEATH

It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of

yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus"

guy instead.

STU

Death! Thank you!

DEATH

Thank me next time you see me.

DEATH

Ohhhh, Hypnos??

HYPNOS

Death! So nice to see you. I can explain -

JULIE

I don't know what happened. All I know is...he

was in a coma...and then he came back...and now

he's gone again.

SURGEON

Excuse me. We lost a corpse - we saw him heading

this way...

DRIVER

I got a couple of fresh ones in the back. Help

yourself.

SURGEON

I'll be. It's him all right. Still dead...

JULIE

Is it you? Is it really you this time?

JULIE

Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.

STU

Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.

JULIE

What's the matter?

STU

My tail itches.

FADE OUT.
