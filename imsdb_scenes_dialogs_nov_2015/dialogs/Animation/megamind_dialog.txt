UBERMAN

You look so peaceful from up here.

UBERMAN (CONT'D)

Looks like Roxanne's in trouble

again.

EINSTEIN

I hate the outfits. I mean, I get

it: we're all supposed to be

"masterminds" - very clever.

(MORE)

3.

EINSTEIN(cont'd)

I just feel stupid. I mean, what

the hell did Einstein really do

anyway?

PLATO

Theory of relativity.

EINSTEIN

Well, you'd think he'd invent a

wool sweater that didn't itch so

much.

MASTER MIND

The real Einstein once said, "God

does not play dice with the world."

He was right, because the world is

MY dice. Is that understood?

DA VINCI & PLATO

Sir! Yes, sir!

EINSTEIN

(gasping for air)

Yes, sir.

MASTER MIND

Alright, then - clean slate. Do we

have the girl?

DA VINCI

Yes, sir. She fell into our trap

just like you knew she would.

MASTER MIND

Reporters are a curious lot, and

easily manipulated.

4.

MASTER MIND

Alright, let's not keep the lady

waiting.

MASTER MIND (O.S.)

Miss Ritchi, we meet again.

ROXANNE

You didn't need to turn around like

that. I can recognize the stench of

failure.

MASTER MIND

I trust you gentlemen know the very

sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly

regarded investigative journalist

who some say has a more than

friendly relationship with our

super powered foe Uberman. And Miss

Ritchi, I trust you've already met

my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!

ROXANNE

Looks like a real group of winners.

At the risk of sounding cliche',

you'll never get away with this.

MASTER MIND

In a way, I already have.

5.

ROXANNE

We go through this every time. You

kidnap me to get to Uberman, he

immediately finds your hideout,

escapes whatever lame trap you've

come up with, and takes you and

your cronies to jail. I propose we

just save everybody some heartache

this time by YOU letting me go, and

ME forgetting this whole thing ever

happened?

MASTER MIND

What about my revenge?

ROXANNE

We can say it was wasting

everyone's time.

MASTER MIND

You have a wicked tongue. I hope

you rid yourself of that when

you're my queen.

ROXANNE

I'm sorry. What makes you think I

would want to be your queen?

MASTER MIND

Power corrupts absolutely, Miss

Ritchi. And when I have ultimate

power over this city, I have

absolutely every intention of

corrupting you with it.

PLATO

Sir!

MASTER MIND

(annoyed)

What is it!?

6.

CUT TO:

UBERMAN

(on monitor)

Master Mind!

MASTER MIND (O.S.)

Over here, old friend.

UBERMAN

What's the matter, miss your old

jail cell?

MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)

Actually, I wanted to share the

experience with my oldest friend.

7.

UBERMAN

You can't possibly believe this

will work.

MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)

Oh, can't I? I have attained

control of the Earth's most

abundant energy source. I doubt

even you are strong enough to

withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED

POWER OF THE SUN!!!

PLATO

We're now at minimum safe distance,

master.

MASTER MIND

Excellent. Stop here, I like this

view.

PLATO

Twenty seconds until impact.

8.

MASTER MIND

Any last words?

UBERMAN (ON MONITOR)

Yes: there's no caging the power of

justice.

PLATO

Ten seconds to impact.

PLATO (CONT'D)

Nine...

PLATO (CONT'D)

Eight...

MASTER MIND

(genuinely concerned)

What's going on?

UBERMAN

(straining)

Hold...on...a second.

PLATO

Seven...

UBERMAN

SON OF A BITCH!!

DA VINCI

What did he just say?

9.

PLATO

Six......Five...

MASTER MIND

What kind of trick is this?

UBERMAN

Like you don't know. These bars are

made of copper, aren't they?

PLATO

Four...

MASTER MIND

Yeah, so?

UBERMAN

You figured out my weakness, damn

you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!

PLATO

Three...

MASTER MIND

Your weakness is copper?

PLATO

Two...one.

10.

PLATO

I don't think even he could have

survived that.

EINSTEIN

Whoa! Is it me or did you just

finally destroy Uberman?

MASTER MIND

(carefully skeptical)

Well...let's not get ahead of

ourselves.

DA VINCI

Look, there's something in the sky,

coming this way.

ROXANNE

Uberman!

MASTER MIND

I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S

GONNA RAM US!!!

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

(horrified)

HOLY SHIT!

11.

ROXANNE

Uberman?

ROXANNE (CONT'D)

You killed him!

EINSTEIN

You did it!

MASTER MIND

...so I did.

EINSTEIN

I mean, I know you always wanted

to. I mean, all the schemes all the

plots - I never thought you'd

actually be capable of it.

EINSTEIN

This is history. Every villain and

lackey in the history of villains

and lackeys dream of this moment,

but when does it actually EVER

happen?

EINSTEIN

Good lord...You do all realize what

we get to do now, don't you?

12.

EINSTEIN

We get to go on a crime wave.

13.

MASTER MIND

(absentmindedly)

Oh, right.

HAL

It's a sport of honor, focus and

grace. Honor the ball, focus on the

pins, release the ball not hard and

fast, but as if you were releasing

a baby dove.

HAL

Okay, do something like that - but

center it more.

14.

ATTRACTIVE BLOND

Tell me how my form looks, honey.

HAL

Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin'

REAL good.

VINNIE (O.S.)

Hal, I want to see you in my

office!

VINNIE

Now!

VINNIE

You're fired. Leave your shirt and

locker key.

HAL

Fired? Are you going to tell me

why?

VINNIE

Showing up to work late. Showing up

to work late drunk. Sexually

harassing customers. Stealing from

the register.

HAL

Vinnie, I don't know where you're

getting these accusations -

15.

HAL

Oh, which one do you supposedly

have here?

VINNIE

This is all of them at once.

HAL

I've got this one, Benny. So,

Cinderella. Can I help you find

your glass slipper?

WOMAN

Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.

HAL

(with a leer)

Seven - Well, maybe I could

interest you in something in an

EIGHT. Namely, me.

HAL

Lesbo.

HAL

From the angle of the camera, I can

see where you might have gotten the

wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't

think you've thought this through.

If you fire me, who's gonna be

captain of the alley's bowling

team?

16.

VINNIE

Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody

who can actually bowl. You guys

have never won a game. I hired you

because you said you were on the

pro circuit.

HAL

No, I said I WILL BE on the pro

circuit.

VINNIE

Please, a loser like you will never

amount to anything.

HAL

Wow...If that's how you feel...I

guess we should then talk about

what kind of severance I'm gonna

get.

HAL

Hey...what about my ball?

HAL

Thank-you!

17.

ROXANNE

It's...um...It's good to be back.

Thanks for everyone's cards and

concerns. I really appreciated it -

now I'm ready to climb back on the

horse.

FRANK

Someone die or something?

FRANK

(cursing himself)

Oh, Jesus.

ROXANNE

It's okay.

FRANK

Come on into my office, sweetie.

FRANK

Can we get this woman some water

for God's sake?

(to Rebecca)

I gave you two months off. What're

you doing back? People are gonna

think I'm a slave driver.

18.

ROXANNE

Aren't you?

FRANK

Yeah, but I don't want people to

think it.

ROXANNE

Frank, listen. I want to go back to

work. I NEED to go back to work.

FRANK

...You're hysterical, aren't you?

ROXANNE

What're you doing?

FRANK

Keeping you warm before you go into

shock.

(toward the open door)

DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP

TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND

HERE?

ROXANNE

It was a traumatic experience. Yes,

everyone knows Uberman and me

were...close. But what I really

need - what would really make me

better is getting back to work.

FRANK

Well, that's going to be...

ROXANNE

I thought you'd be happy to have me

back.

19.

FRANK

ROXANNE

FRANK

ROXANNE

FRANK

ROXANNE

(disgusted)

FRANK

ROXANNE

FRANK

ROXANNE

(defensive)

FRANK

ROXANNE

20.

FRANK

And that's great.

ROXANNE

Very in love.

ROXANNE

Okay. So, where are they going to

move me if Brad has my spot?

FRANK

...Human interest.

ROXANNE

Bake sales and pet stories.

FRANK

I told them I wouldn't be surprised

if you just upped and quit. You

busted your ass for that desk.

ROXANNE

I'll take it.

FRANK

What?

21.

REPORTER ON TELEVISION (O.S.)

It's been nearly six weeks, and

still no word on the whereabouts of

billionaire playboy, and

philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune

in at 11:00 as we look into what

has become Metro City's biggest

mystery.

TELEVISION NARRATOR (O.S.)

We now return to "The Hero of our

Hearts: The Uberman story."

EINSTEIN

Just robbed the diamond exchange.

MASTER MIND

(feigning pleasure)

Great, great. Put it on the pile.

EINSTEIN

Anything else today?

MASTER MIND

No.

PLATO

(cheerfully)

Sir, the new reactor is installed.

PLATO

Do you want to throw the switch? I

know how you love to start

reactors.

22.

MASTER MIND

Maybe later.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

What is it, Plato?

PLATO

(nervously)

Sir, I can't help but notice that

you've been...a little down lately.

MASTER MIND

When I want your opinion I'll beat

it out of you.

PLATO

Yes, sir, I know, but please

forgive my impertinence. It's just

that you seem to have lost your

lust for our profession. You've

stopped going on jobs and spend

most of your time watching Uberman

specials.

MASTER MIND

I have defeated my greatest enemy.

I have free reign over Metro City.

I have more wealth than a thousand

Sultans. I've achieved all I have

worked for...so why am I so

unhappy?

MASTER MIND

I mean, my father, god rest his

evil and tormented soul, raised me

straight from the test tube to be a

symbol of evil.

(MORE)

23.

MASTER MIND(cont'd)

And, I have accomplished something

he had only dreamed about - the

destruction of Metro City's

champion. I tell you, I've always

lived with this unquenchable

thirst. I thought it was to make

him proud or to get absolute power.

But now that I've pretty much

accomplished both, I am at a loss.

PLATO

...I sort of have a theory about

all that.

MASTER MIND

(snippy)

Oh, really?

PLATO

Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman

was more important to you than you

thought.

MASTER MIND

He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I

wonder, did he consider me his evil

equal or was I just an annoying,

little gnat to him? ...What's the

second part?

PLATO

I think you sort of have a thing

for Roxanne Ritchi.

MASTER MIND

YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD

YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?

PLATO

Sir, your plans always involve Ms.

Ritchi either being kidnapped or

placed in danger. If that's not

love, I don't know what is. It's

the grown up equivalent of dipping

her pigtails in the ink well. Don't

you see? She's the one treasure

that's always escaped you.

24.

FRIEND #1

I can't believe you came back so

soon.

FRIEND #2

Are you sure it's not TOO SOON,

honey?

ROXANNE

I just wanted to get back to work.

FRIEND #3

What we need to do is get you back

on the saddle...the love saddle.

FRIEND #3

It's been three weeks.

FRIEND #2

She just lost the love of her life,

Grace.

ROXANNE

I keep trying to tell people it

wasn't really like that. Uberman

and I - We were kinda having

problems. We broke up.

FRIEND #1

You broke up with Uberman!

FRIEND #3

You must have REALLY, REALLY high

standards. I mean, you were dating

a god. I mean, what's it take?

ROXANNE

Maybe someone who's a little more

aware of his faults. Someone a

little more sensitive.

25.

FRIEND #3

Right. Someone who listens, sexy

but attainable with cute little

cheeks like a hamster and

heartbreak in his eyes.

FRIEND #3

She wants John Cusack.

FRIEND #2

The actor?

FRIEND #3

No, the famous pediatrist - Yes,

the actor. Ever since we were

teenagers, Roxanne's totally had

the hots for him.

ROXANNE

Well, until he miraculously comes

walking into my life, I'm just

going to take a little reflection

time for myself.

MASTER MIND

Who the hell is John Cusack?

26.

POLITICIAN

The Fifth Avenue Renovation

Project, which I championed, will

breath new life into the downtown

area. New life means new jobs and

new revenue.

ROXANNE

Councilman, is it true that your

brother-in-law's construction

company won the contract for this

project?

POLITICIAN

Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not

here to answer a lot of crazy

questions...

27.

YOUNG MOTHER

Thank you! Thank you for saving me

and my baby!

HAL

(not knowing what she's

talking about)

Huh?

HAL (CONT'D)

There, there.

HAL (CONT'D)

Okay, we better...well, I hear

these little guys smother easy.

ROXANNE

What's it feel like to be a hero?

HAL

Well...I'm just a man doing what

men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi,

aren't you?

REPORTER

Were you scared?

28.

HAL

Scared? Who had time?

MASTER MIND

John Cusack, huh? So all I have to

do is have a cute puppy dog stare,

be willing to make a fool of myself

and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.

MASTER MIND

Please, get a hold of yourself.

ROXANNE

Shit.

"JOHN CUSACK"

Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.

ROXANNE

(stunned)

You're...you're.

"JOHN CUSACK"

Yes, it's me. John Cusack...the

actor.

29.

"JOHN CUSACK"

Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think

remember something from that one -

Let's see: "My head is screaming `I

want you and need you' - my heart

it keeps reaching to see you and

feel you - yet in the end, I'm

alone once again." Wow, I scare

even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just

really into poetry. Probably

because I'm so sensitive and always

going to great lengths to express

myself. But enough about me. Can I

fill you up?

ROXANNE

(captivated)

...Yes.

(catching herself)

I mean, excuse me?

"JOHN CUSACK"

Can I fill you up? Your coffee.

ROXANNE

Right.

ROXANNE

I did have a boyfriend - until

fairly recently.

ROXANNE

I'm sorry - this is so surreal!

"JOHN CUSACK"

Yeah, they charge way too much at

these places - Now back to your

boyfriend. I'm interested and

compassionate. I want to know about

you.

30.

ROXANNE

Things were complicated. He was a

man married to his work. There

was...there was a lot of

competition in his line of

business. I'm sure you know what

that's like.

"JOHN CUSACK"

Sure. In my business, one thing I

have is RIVALS. For example, mine

is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.

ROXANNE

...The body-builder who used to

play The Hulk on TV?

"JOHN CUSACK"

Did he? Well, we're always up for

the same roles. Did your boyfriend

have someone like that? A

particular rival that was always

getting his goat - so to speak?

ROXANNE

Well...one rival in particular

seemed to get more of his attention

than I ever did. But enough about

my problems.

"JOHN CUSACK"

NO, TELL ME MORE!!!

"JOHN CUSACK" (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough.

Had it ever since Serendipity. I

WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!!

(fakes cough) See, there it goes

again. Please, go on.

ROXANNE

Right, well, he seemed to need him

more than he needed me.

"JOHN CUSACK"

How do you mean?

31.

ROXANNE

It was conflict he thrived on. He

always said he wouldn't know what

to do with himself if Master - I

mean, this guy were gone. It was

like he needed it, like oxygen.

"JOHN CUSACK"

(almost to himself)

I think I finally understand...The

only logical answer is to recreate

that rivalry - or if that's

impossible, create one of equal

structure. That's it!

ROXANNE

What?

"JOHN CUSACK"

Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing

for a part...where I play a man who

talks to himself at inappropriate

times.

"JOHN CUSACK"

I have to go right now, but I'd

really like to see you again - if

that's alright.

ROXANNE

I'd love that.

EINSTEIN

Got her nose!

MASTER MIND

I've got it!

32.

MASTER MIND

I've got it!

MASTER MIND

It's plain and simple.

Extraordinary minds need

extraordinary stimulation. Without

that stimulus they wither and die.

Therefore, there is only one

logical conclusion: I must create a

new superhero.

EINSTEIN

Yeah, maybe that's not such hot

idea...

MASTER MIND

(ignoring him)

Prepare for Operation Superhero

Genesis!

MASTER MIND

Prepare the subject.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Plato, pour the toxic waste.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Drainage.

33.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Well, Severs?

SEVERS

I feel fine. Just a little sticky,

but aside from that everything's

completely -

MASTER MIND

Okay then.

MASTER MIND

And this one?

PLATO

We attached gills to him. He can

breath under water.

MASTER MIND

Ah. Does he have extraordinary

strength?

PLATO

Well...no.

MASTER MIND

Can he fly?

PLATO

No.

MASTER MIND

Resilient to weapons fire?

PLATO

No.

MASTER MIND

He just breathes under water, then.

PLATO

Ah...yeah.

34.

MASTER MIND

Plato, the radioactive spider,

please.

STENWICK

Ow!

MASTER MIND

Anything, Stenwick?

STENWICK

(shaken)

No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this

was about spiders. I have a pretty

severe case of arachnophobia.

MASTER MIND

We're gonna need more venom.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

How `bout now, Stenwick?

....Stenwick?

MASTER MIND

This has proven to be a challenge.

I just don't know what I want. What

do I want?

35.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

I want a man of moral fiber with a

strong sense of right and wrong.

Someone who doesn't seek power -

instead, they must have it thrust

upon them and find, within

themselves, the courage to rise to

the occasion.

EINSTEIN

Yeah, well, it sounds like what you

want is Uberman.

MASTER MIND

That's it! Why make a copy when the

real thing will do?

EINSTEIN

I was just kidding, sir. In case

you forgot, you actually burned

Uberman alive.

MASTER MIND

Then we'll make a new one. Plato,

bring me the box!

MASTER MIND

Behold - Uberessence. The very

thing that gave Uberman his

superhuman powers.

36.

EINSTEIN

Where the hell did you get that?

MASTER MIND

Oh, I shot him with a power sucking

gun and had this idea to use this

to clone a whole army of evil

Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never

got around to following up with

that.

PLATO

I believe he defeated you before

you could, master.

MASTER MIND

...Right. Man, he was good!

DA VINCI

You want another volunteer, sir?

MASTER MIND

Not another volunteer driven by the

need for personal gain. Somebody

else, somebody pure.

NEWS REPORTER

...who risked his own life to save

that of a young mother and her

child.

HAL

Please, please, you're embarrassing

me. I saw someone in need and I

helped them. What more can we ask

of ourselves. I ask you, what more?

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Somebody like him!

37.

PLATO

Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece

of work. He used to teach bowling

at Kingpin's.

MASTER MIND

(into phone)

A modest profession to brilliantly

hide his true heroic nature. I love

it.

PLATO

Then you are absolutely going to

love this -

PLATO

- He volunteers at a school for the

blind.

MASTER MIND

He volunteers. He doesn't ask for

any reward for his deeds. The fates

are shining down on me. This Mr.

Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.

HAL

You greedy little bastard. I

already gave you a twenty.

BLIND KID

Hey, you want me to play along?

Then pay up, bitch!

38.

HAL

Fine, but you better be convincing.

HAL

Here she comes, go to work.

BLIND KID

(weeping)

Why can't I see! Why God?

HAL

Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me

look at you.

HAL

You know, in life we're all given

no more than we can bear. This

happened to you maybe because you

were meant to rise above it - Maybe

to be an inspiration to the other

little Peteys out there.

BLIND KID

You really think so, Hal?

HAL

Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying?

Now c'mon, go feel your way to

class before you get your little

butt suspended.

HAL

Petey, wait a minute.

39.

HAL

Don't run into anything!

PLATO

I think I've seen enough, sir. This

is your guy.

MASTER MIND (O.S.)

(over radio)

Then return to base. We have much

work to do.

HAL

(obviously playing it up

for the woman's benefit)

Oh, there it is again. This is

really getting embarrassing now.

ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN

Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man

who saved that woman   and her baby

the other day! It is   you, isn't it?

40.

HAL

(to Attractive Woman)

Oh, crap. You got me.

TRUCKER#1

Let me tell you something. That was

just about the bravest damn thing

I've ever witnessed. (he turns to

the rest of the bar) Hey,

everybody! This guy's the hero from

TV!

TRUCKER#1

I want to give you something.

TRUCKER#1 (CONT'D)

Lost my whole platoon. They were a

lot a good boys, a lot of good

boys. That was just the way things

were in "The Grenada." I'd rather a

real hero have this.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

Hey, you're on TV again.

41.

BRAD HELMS

This just in. Upon a second look at

that tape from this morning, which

we'll now replay for you, it

appears it was not the heroic act

it first seemed to be.

BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT'D)

With the tape slowed down you can

actually see the man push the woman

and her child out of the way in an

effort to save his own life.

CUT BACK TO:

HAL

I guess that looks kinda bad.

DA VINCI

There he is, boss.

MASTER MIND

Now, we're sure this won't kill

him?

PLATO

Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight

electrical shock.

MASTER MIND

Good.

42.

MASTER MIND

Slight electrical shock?

HAL

God, I hate the weather in this

city.

MASTER MIND

Follow him.

43.

CAT

You don't look so good, man.

HAL

I don't feel good. I was struck by

freaking lightening.

HAL (CONT'D)

AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?

CAT

No, you're just hallucinating. By

the way, we're out of orange juice.

HAL

AAAAAAHHHHH!

HAL

Man...

44.

HAL (CONT'D)

Oh, God!

HAL (CONT'D)

Oh, God!

HAL (CONT'D)

Oh, God!

HAL

Wait!

HAL (CONT'D)

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

45.

HAL (CONT'D)

Something's not right here.

HAL (CONT'D)

Wake up! Wake up, Hal!

HAL (CONT'D)

Okay, okay. Let's get it together,

man.

HAL (CONT'D)

This is just some sort

of...episode. It will pass, it will

pass.

HAL (CONT'D)

Well, not too fast I hope.

HAL (CONT'D)

Yes, fast, fast!

46.

HAL (CONT'D)

I think I need to go home.

MASTER MIND

Welcome to your second birth, Hal

Stewart.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Instruction is very important in

the formative years. Every hero

needs a mentor, a father figure to

look up to.

"PAT MORITA"

Perfect.

VOICE (O.S.)

A man will usually find that if he

drinks from a bottle, eventually,

the bottle drinks from him.

HAL

Who are you!?

47.

VOICE

I am the guide on your journey.

Fate has chosen you to be it's

champion.

HAL

Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I

must be losing it.

"PAT MORITA" (O.S.)

You know you're out of orange

juice?

HAL

Jesus! This isn't happening, this

isn't happening.

"PAT MORITA"

Calm. All things must be filtered

through calmness.

HAL

Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to

freak out.

"PAT MORITA"

I think we must work on your

attitude first.

HAL

Look I'm gonna call the cops in

about two seconds if you don't get

out of here.

48.

"PAT MORITA"

Are you calm now?

HAL

Yeah, I'm okay.

"PAT MORITA"

Good, because we've got a lot of

work to do.

HAL

What the hell was that for?

"PAT MORITA"

Rule number one: expect the

unexpected.

HAL

Can you just tell me what this is

all about?

"PAT MORITA"

The heavens are not in the habit of

bestowing a gift such as this to

just anyone. You are being rewarded

for being a man of great moral

fortitude with an unwavering belief

in humanity.

HAL

That's me alright.

"PAT MORITA"

I am to train you so you may

fulfill your destiny to defeat the

great menace to Metro City: Master

Mind.

"PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)

Come.

HAL

We're are we going?

49.

"PAT MORITA"

To train.

"PAT MORITA"

Strength is just as much in the

mind as it is the muscle. Remember,

both need to be exercised.

HAL

I'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!

"PAT MORITA"

Hey, Corky? You listening?

HAL

Yeah, work both muscles.

"PAT MORITA"

Trust me.

HAL

What are you doing!?

"PAT MORITA"

An invulnerability test. Something

wrong?

HAL

Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to

get shot. Do not fire that thing!

50.

"PAT MORITA"

You're bulletproof.

HAL

Okay, do you know that for sure?

"PAT MORITA"

I do now.

HAL

You suck.

HAL

Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.

Two Russian Migs coming in hard and

fast.

"PAT MORITA"

Hey!

HAL

What?

"PAT MORITA"

What did I tell you? Stomach down,

hands up.

HAL

God, I feel so gay.

"PAT MORITA"

(in Master Mind voice)

What is it?

51.

ROXANNE (V.O.)

John?

HAL

YEEEE HAWWWW!

"PAT MORITA"

(in Cusack voice)

Yes, it's John Cusack.

ROXANNE (V.O.)

Hi, it's Roxanne. Listen, I...I

really enjoyed talking with you the

other day.

"PAT MORITA"

...As did I.

ROXANNE (V.O.)

Great. God, I feel really silly,

and if you have a lot going on I

totally understand. But, I was

wondering if you maybe wanted to

have lunch.

"PAT MORITA"

(excited)

I'd love to!

"PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)

I mean, I AM a little hungry.

ROXANNE (V.O.)

Great. How does the park sound,

around noon-ish?

"PAT MORITA"

Sure!

ROXANNE (V.O.)

Great, see you then.

52.

HAL

WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's

like fly - Oh my God, I almost said

it was like flying.

"PAT MORITA"

For the rest of the day I want you

to continue to practice your flying

posture.

HAL

Why, where're ya going?

"PAT MORITA"

...To do something...mysterious

...and Asian.

HAL

Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at

it, then.

ROXANNE

How's your sandwich?

"JOHN CUSACK"

It's quite delicious.

ROXANNE

Hope you don't think I'm too

forward. Some men are intimidated

when a woman asks them out. I just

find you really easy to talk to.

"JOHN CUSACK"

And I you.

ROXANNE

You know, you're not at all like

you are in the movies.

"JOHN CUSACK"

I'm not?

53.

ROXANNE

Yeah. I don't know - You have this

strange, refined way of speaking.

"JOHN CUSACK"

I do? That is most interesting.

ROXANNE

Anyway, when we were talking the

other day I just felt, even though

we only talked for a couple of

hours, that we've known each other

for years.

"JOHN CUSACK"

I know just what you mean.

ROXANNE

You know what? This sandwich is

disgusting.

ROXANNE (CONT'D)

Of course I already ate half of it.

I wonder what that says about my

character?

"JOHN CUSACK"

It means you don't give up on a

sandwich. You see that it has

potential, and you give it every

chance to be all it can be.

ROXANNE

Thanks, but knowing me, I was

probably projecting my expectations

of what a lunch should be on the

sandwich. It might have been okay

at first, but I just made it

bitter.

"JOHN CUSACK"

Is that what happened with your

last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?

54.

ROXANNE

When I look back, I probably

shouldn't of expected so much from

him. He was already a giving

person. You know, one of those go

out and save the world types.

"JOHN CUSACK"

I've run into a few.

ROXANNE

I was selfish, I guess. I didn't

want to share him with anybody

else.

"JOHN CUSACK"

It sounds like he was a special

man.

ROXANNE

They broke the mold.

"JOHN CUSACK"

Perhaps not.

TITAN

What's the "T" stand for?

"PAT MORITA"

Titan.

TITAN

What's that supposed to mean?

"PAT MORITA"

It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's

father...oh, just go with it. You

look perfect.

TITAN

I don't think this mask is big

enough. Are you sure no one is

gonna recognize me?

55.

"PAT MORITA"

It's fine, just don't slouch. It's

all in the posture.

"PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)

It is time.

JOHN

Alright folks, this is a robbery.

Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,

yadda...

GEORGE

The safe. Let's go.

BANK MANAGER

Okay, just don't hurt anyone.

GEORGE

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

TITAN

Well, boys, there's no need for all

this just to get the free toaster.

56.

PAUL

What are you suppose to be?

TITAN

Justice.

GEORGE

Well, justice, suck on this...

TITAN

Now it's my turn.

TITAN (CONT'D)

Hey, George, here comes the sun.

TITAN (CONT'D)

Say, Paul, your mother should

know...that you're a scumbag.

TITAN (CONT'D)

John, all you need is love...

TITAN (CONT'D)

...and a good urologist.

57.

HAL

Well, Ringo...um...um...you're

under arrest.

BANK MANAGER

(to Hal)

On behalf of the First National

Bank of Metro City, I'd like to

offer you a reward for your act of

bravery.

TITAN

(reading)

Ten thousand dollars!

TITAN (CONT'D)

(unenthusiastically)

I...can't except this. Law and

order is it's own...um...reward.

BRAD HELMS (O.S.)

Not so fast, Roxanne.

BRAD HELMS

This story's mine.

58.

ROXANNE

Listen, Brad. We were just in the

area. I was just trying to -

BRAD HELMS

I've been in this business long

enough to know pretty well what you

were "just trying to do." Besides,

I heard you couldn't take the big

game anymore and were put on fluff

detail?

SETH

You're not gonna take that from

him, are you?

ROXANNE

He's right. Old habit, I guess.

(to Brad)

We'll get out of your way.

BRAD HELMS

Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake

supper somewhere that needs

covering.

BRAD HELMS

For months now, since the death of

Uberman, the citizens of Metro City

have been holding out for a hero.

Well, it appears they won't have to

hold out for much longer as a new

costumed crusader has suddenly

stormed onto the scene. Today, at

the Metro Savings and Trust, a

masked mystery man single-handedly

defeated "The Fab Four Gang." Just

who is this new caped avenger?

59.

BRAD HELMS

I'm sure all of our viewers are now

wondering, what's the "T" stand

for?

TITAN

It's a message to all the scum out

there. Uberman may be gone, but

Metro City has a new protector, and

his name is "Tighten!"

REPORTER

How do you spell that?

MASTER MIND

(reading paper)

Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't

believe it. He misspelled his name.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

No matter, I suppose.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

We've now fully established Titan

as Metro City's hero. They will

love him just as they loved

Uberman. Everything is going

according to plan.

EINSTEIN

(whispering)

Yeah, if the plan is getting us in

jail.

60.

MASTER MIND

You know, Einstein, maybe I should

have called you Socrates. He also

didn't know when to keep his

thoughts to himself.

EINSTEIN

I just fail to see the point in all

of this. I mean, why are we

creating another superhero when it

was such a pain in the ass for you

to get rid of the other one? I

mean, Uberman is destroyed, we

should be using this opportunity

to...to...

MASTER MIND

To what?

EINSTEIN

I don't know. To take over the

weather, space, the world -

whatever super villains are

SUPPOSED to do.

MASTER MIND

The reason someone like you will

always be a minion is because you

have no foresight. We take over the

earth, like you said. Then what?

Women? Cars? Money? Even the

grandest treasures will lose their

lustre if you don't have someone to

hold them over.

EINSTEIN

That's it! This balance of the

force bullshit is getting way too

Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's

with me?

MASTER MIND

You dare?

EINSTEIN

Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing

stupid costumes, and I'm sick of

working for a super villain who's

turning into a softie.

61.

MASTER MIND

What - did - you - call me?

EINSTEIN

You heard me. You used to be an

inhuman monster, now look at you.

You're creating super heroes, you

don't go with us on robberies

anymore, it's been days since you

threatened anyone, oh, and not to

mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.

MASTER MIND

THAT is none of your business,

knave!

EINSTEIN

Hey, you guys haven't sealed the

deal yet, have you?

MASTER MIND

Silence!

EINSTEIN

(In a woman's voice)

Oh, Master, your head is so big.

MASTER MIND

I'm warning you, Einstein.

EINSTEIN

(In a woman's voice)

Take me!

MASTER MIND

I said silence!

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Get out of my sight.

62.

ROXANNE

Don't get me wrong, I love being a

reporter. I don't think I could do

anything else. It's the

consequences of what we do that I'm

having a problem with.

"JOHN CUSACK"

That's where journalistic

responsibility comes in, no?

ROXANNE

It's supposed to.

"JOHN CUSACK"

Sounds to me like you're running

from something.

ROXANNE

I got someone I cared about killed.

If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't

have been involved.

"JOHN CUSACK"

You can't blame yourself. My father

used to say each of us must answer

the great call to truly feel alive.

ROXANNE

Was he an actor?

"JOHN CUSACK"

...No. He was...a landscaper. And a

horrible one. I mean he would fail

time and time again at

his...landscaping. And sometimes

he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown

in jail -

ROXANNE

Jail?

63.

"JOHN CUSACK"

My point is he took the good with

the bad. He grew a little each

time. Improved, learned.

ROXANNE

Was he ever successful?

"JOHN CUSACK"

God, no...but don't let deter you.

ROXANNE

Thanks for this. You know, this is

embarrassing, but it's been a long

time since I -

ROXANNE (CONT'D)

I think it's starting to rain. We

might want to find a table inside.

"JOHN CUSACK"

What were you gonna say?

ROXANNE

Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a

long time since...well, I've been

with someone I...enjoy being with.

"JOHN CUSACK"

To people who enjoy being with each

other.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Oh, no. Don't look at me.

64.

"JOHN CUSACK"

Okay, never mind that. Now, where

were we?

ROXANNE

Oh my God.

MASTER MIND

You're not gonna get all freaky

about this, are you?

ROXANNE

This...this is too much, even for

you. God, I go out with you, tell

you my innermost thoughts.

MASTER MIND

I only did this because I wanted to

talk to you on the same level. You

know, without all the baggage?

ROXANNE

Baggage? You burned my boyfriend

alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!

MASTER MIND

You see, that's exactly what I'm

talking about.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Roxanne!

ROXANNE

Stay away from me.

65.

MASTER MIND

What?

MASTER MIND

(mumbling to himself)

Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,

it's his fault. He's the one who

sent me on this weak-willed path.

I'll filet his scrotum for this.

Me, a creature of evil, in love

with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.

I hardly give such matters thought

CUT TO:

MASTER MIND

I should just go up there and just

lay it all out to her. "Roxanne, I

like you - I always have. Oh, and

I'm sorry I blew up your ex.

(realizing the absurdity of his

words) Yeah, that would go over

like a pants-less clown at a

child's birthday party. What the

hell am I even doing here? Who

cares what she thinks? I'm a

supervillain and here I am acting

like a love struck schoolboy.

Forget this. I control my own

destiny!

66.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

(disgusted)

Perfect.

ROXANNE

Damn.

ROXANNE

Please be open.

ROXANNE (CONT'D)

Thank God.

ROXANNE

A pack of Lady Strikes, please.

MASTER MIND

Hello, Triple A?

67.

MASTER MIND

I'll call you back.

SHOPKEEPER

Hey!

SHOTGUN HOODLUM

Shut up, Gramps.

SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT'D)

Gimme that necklace!

ROXANNE

I don't think so.

SHOTGUN HOODLUM

I said give it to me!

MASTER MIND (O.S.)

The lady said no.

68.

SHOTGUN HOODLUM

What the hell's that? A super

soaker?

MASTER MIND

No, it's a goo gun.

SHOTGUN HOODLUM

Yeah, what's it do?

MASTER MIND

It goos.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

It's...a prototype.

SHOPKEEPER

I know you! You Master Brain guy.

You a hero.

MASTER MIND

Don't - EVER - say that again.

ROXANNE

Hey!

ROXANNE (CONT'D)

Are you following me or something?

69.

MASTER MIND

Don't flatter yourself.

ROXANNE

Don't walk away from me when I'm

talking to you.

ROXANNE (CONT'D)

What a minute...all that stuff you

use to say to me when Uberman was

alive - about me being the loyal

queen by your side as you rule over

Metro City. That wasn't just super

villain rhetoric, was it? You

actually meant it!

MASTER MIND

My, someone has a rather high

opinion of themselves.

ROXANNE

(coldly)

Do you really think I would be with

someone like you?

MASTER MIND

No.

PLATO

Everything alright, sir?

70.

MASTER MIND

(overly calm)

Fine, why do you ask?

PLATO

You...just...seem...

MASTER MIND

Go on.

PLATO

...distracted.

MASTER MIND

Just with business, my minion. Just

with business. I've decided it is

time.

PLATO

You mean?

MASTER MIND

Yes, we've created our hero, now

it's time to give him a little

motivation.

DA VINCI

How do we do that?

MASTER MIND

To be simply good is not enough. A

hero must be driven by an almost

relentless desire to right a wrong

that can never be corrected.

PLATO

You mean?

MASTER MIND

Yes, he must lose someone near and

dear to him - his father figure.

Gentlemen, it's time for Operation

Mentor Kill!

71.

TITAN

Man, what the hell happened down

there? Wait a sec -

TITAN (CONT'D)

THAT'S MY APARTMENT!!!

TITAN

Crap.

TITAN (CONT'D)

PAT!

TITAN (CONT'D)

You okay?

"PAT MORITA"

I'm dying, kid. There is just one

last lesson I have for you. It is

the most important of all.

72.

TITAN

What's that?

"PAT MORITA"

Master Mind did this, you must

avenge me.

TITAN

Master Mind? Why?

"PAT MORITA"

Because he's evil. You must stop

the evil Hal - stop the...

REPORTER 1

Tighten, Is this the work of Master

Mind?

REPORTER 2

How will the death of your mentor

affect your resolve?

REPORTER 3

Was that Pat Morita?

TITAN

This injustice will not go

unpunished. Master Mind, if you can

hear me, Tighten is coming for you.

73.

MASTER MIND

Alright, people, we don't have much

time. Titan should be here any

minute, so let's get the lead out.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

How's the death ray coming?

DA VINCI

Nearly up to full power, sir.

MASTER MIND

Hum. Let's turn it down a few

notches. It's his first time and

we don't want to get in a lucky

shot, now do we?

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Anything on the radar yet?

PLATO

Not yet, sir.

MASTER MIND

I see. Well, he must be planning

something big. Are the flame

androids deployed?

PLATO

All twelve.

MASTER MIND

Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da

Vinci, take your places next to me.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

No slouching.

74.

PLATO

He's certainly taking his time.

MASTER MIND

He'll be here. That's the way it

works.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Unprofessional, that's what this

is. No, it's disrespect for the

craft.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Would Uberman have kept us waiting

like this? Of course not. He was a

pro who knew the score. It's time

we spelled out a few things for

this Titan. I will not be made a

fool of.

TITAN

Oh, for crying out loud.

MASTER MIND

Do you know who I am?

75.

TITAN

Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah!

You're actually the guy I want to

see!

MASTER MIND

Oh, so NOW you want to get down to

it. Well, I want to get a few

things off my chest first.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Of all the inconsiderate - Do you

have any idea how long we waited

for you? We're you even planning on

coming to me and getting revenge?

TITAN

Well, at first I was going to. You

know, because that's what I figured

I was supposed to do. But then I

got to thinking-

MASTER MIND

(interrupting)

-You got to thinking? There's

nothing to think about. I'm the

villain. I do something bad, you

come and get me.

TITAN

- I got to thinking...what's the

point?

MASTER MIND

Maybe you're right. What's the

point?

76.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

What are these?

TITAN

That's what I wanted to talk to you

about.

MASTER MIND

(baffled)

Where did you get all this?

TITAN

(proudly)

Get this: I stole them.

MASTER MIND

From where?

TITAN

From all over. You see, once you

killed Pat and ruined my other

apartment building I was pretty

pissed off, so I figured I'd go,

find you and kick some ass. Then I

thought to myself: "Okay,then

what?" I mean, if we were to fight,

what would I get out of it? Would I

get my apartment back? Would I be

able to pay the bills?

MASTER MIND

Well, what about your mentor?

TITAN

Tell you the truth? He was kind of

a dick. I mean, being a hero is

dandy and all, but it's volunteer

work. Now you've always had the

right take on all this. I mean,

when you rob a bank or take over

the diamond exchange you get

something out of it. I mean, when

you don't get caught, which, no

offense, isn't very often. And that

brings me to what I wanted to

propose to you: Who could catch you

if I'm by your side?

MASTER MIND

You want to team-up?

77.

TITAN

You got the brains, I got the

brawn. We could even call ourselves

that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at

this.

TITAN (CONT'D)

I even designed us some new

costumes.

TITAN (CONT'D)

See, you'd be brain, so you got a

little one on your costume, and

then I'll have brawn on mine...once

I figure out the best, you know,

visual interpretation of it. What

do you think?

MASTER MIND

What do I think?

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

I think you're probably the biggest

idiot I've ever met. I mean, I

can't believe you. All your gifts,

all your powers, and all you want

to use them for is your own

financial fulfillment. You know

what? Your kind of people make me

sick.

TITAN

I worked hard on this.

MASTER MIND

Oh - gee - I am so sorry!

78.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

(under his breath)

Of all the people to pick, it had

to be this loser.

TITAN

Now, hold on. You're going a little

too far.

MASTER MIND

I wish your mother said that to

your father the night of your

conception, they would have saved

me a whole lot of heartache.

TITAN

Hey, I mean it.

MASTER MIND

Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

DA VINCI

Master!

MASTER MIND (O.S.)

It hurts.

DA VINCI

What hurts?

MASTER MIND

It!

79.

TITAN

I don't need you, I don't need

anybody. I have the power to do and

take anything I want. And now, I'm

gonna take back everything this

city owes me. Beware Metro City,

it's time for Titan to collect.

TITAN (CONT'D)

Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY

THE WAY I WANT TO FLY!

DA VINCI

How'd the plan go, boss?

MASTER MIND

I just made myself redundant, old

friend.

DA VINCI

It's not that bad.

SECURITY GUARD

Morning, Tighten.

TITAN

Morning.

SECURITY GUARD

Is there something we can do for

you?

80.

TITAN

Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just

here to make a withdrawal.

BANK MANAGER

Say, did he just rob us?

SECURITY GUARD

Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't

it?

BANK MANAGER

Yeah.

SECURITY GUARD

Should I, you know, stop him?

BANK MANAGER

Umm...Yeah.

BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)

(looking down at the

guard)

He did rob us, didn't he?

CUT TO:

81.

BRAD HELMS

"Absolute power corrupts

absolutely." When Lord Acton stated

that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell

Creighton in 1887, no one thought

much about it, but today Metro City

is reeling from that very prophecy.

Tighten, who many thought of as our

savior, has turned his back on the

cause of justice.

CUT TO:

PLATO

I don't understand it. He seemed to

have every characteristic we were

looking for in a superhero.

MASTER MIND

Well, there's no use crying about

it now, we must take action. I'm

not going to play second fiddle to

that crass buffoon. We must destroy

Tighten.

82.

PLATO

It won't be easy. Uberman had a

sense of decency and genuine love

for the people. That was his

weakness and was easily used

against him.

MASTER MIND

Yes, but he possesses the same

flaws present in Uberman's DNA -

copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin

always said: "If something works

don't dick with it."

TITAN

I can have anything I want. I'm

like a god.

TITAN

Point to any woman in this bar. I

could have her in a second.

TITAN

(to Old Barfly)

Hey, you wanna get with this?

BARTENDER

Buddy, what do you want?

TITAN

What do you want? That's the

question, isn't it. I mean, what do

you want when you can have

everything?

(MORE)

83.

TITAN(cont'd)

I suppose what I really want is to

never be forgotten again. I want to

do something that can never be cast

aside or one-upped. I want a -

what's it called? - A legacy. I

want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I

like the sound that.

BARTENDER

I meant, what do you want to drink?

TITAN

Oh.

MASTER MIND (O.S.)

Your time has come to an end,

Titan!

TITAN

What?

MASTER MIND

There can be only one master

criminal in this city - and it's

me.

TITAN

Really?

TITAN (CONT'D)

I guess I should leave town then,

huh?

MASTER MIND

I have a better idea - NOW!

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

That's copper my good man. Your one

weakness.

(MORE)

84.

MASTER MIND(cont'd)

For all your amazing gifts of brawn

you are no match for my intellect.

TITAN

You know what? You're nothing but a

bug. Not even worth my effort.

MASTER MIND

He's not as dumb as I thought.

PLATO

I guess not...Funny, though.

MASTER MIND

What's funny?

PLATO

Funny Uberman didn't think of the

same thing.

HAL

That's it!

85.

HAL

Hello, Legacy.

VINNIE

Hey, that's my ball!

ELDERLY WOMAN

That was a close one. Sixth floor,

please.

MASTER MIND

Wow, I always thought Uberman was

your first superhero - but it looks

like our little Roxanne dated a

linebacker in college.

ROXANNE

That's my diary.

MASTER MIND

So it is.

86.

ROXANNE

It's personal.

MASTER MIND

Well, then I wouldn't leave it in

your underwear drawer for just

anyone to find.

ROXANNE

What do you want?

MASTER MIND

I need your help.

ROXANNE

So you knock me out and tie me to a

chair?

MASTER MIND

You're not going to like what I'm

about to tell you.

BRAD HELMS

It's chaos here in city square as

city police -

ROXANNE

He's really out of control.

MASTER MIND

Tell me about it.

ROXANNE

I should have known. You have

something to do with this, don't

you? - With Titan turning evil.

87.

MASTER MIND

Well, the evil thing he did by

himself. My goal was to give MYSELF

purpose by creating an intellectual

sparring partner.

ROXANNE

(confused)

You're talking like you made him.

MASTER MIND

And they call me Master Mind.

ROXANNE

Let me get this straight. You

missed getting your ass kicked, so

you made a new guy to kick your

ass. That's pathetic.

MASTER MIND

In hindsight...

ROXANNE

And his powers, they're just like

Uberman's. Why would he have his

powers?

MASTER MIND

(almost ashamed)

I had some left over from

something. I infused him with it.

ROXANNE

YOU DID WHAT!?

MASTER MIND

Yeah, that's why I decided to tie

you up.

ROXANNE

You did all this because you wanted

purpose?

MASTER MIND

He seemed nice.

88.

TITAN

Closer. I want to show the people

my real face.

TITAN (CONT'D)

Recognize me?

ROXANNE

Hal Stewart. He's the guy we

thought saved that woman and kid.

Turned out he was just trying to

save his own ass.

MASTER MIND

Yeah, good to know - NOW!

TITAN

That's right, I'm really Hal

Stewart. Former hero and bowling

teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.

ROXANNE

You picked a bowler to give super

powers to?

MASTER MIND

It's a modest profession!

89.

TITAN

With my new found power, I've

recently started to wonder what

sort of legacy I should leave.

Should I be a hero? I tried that

once before - even saved a lady and

her baby from being squashed. I was

treated like a god until everyone

started to shit on me - Okay, so

what if I didn't "purposely" save

them!

TITAN

Well, I'm going to make something

that can't be taken away from me.

I'm going to create a permanent

monument to my greatness. One that

won't be so easily forgotten or

erased.

TITAN

I intend to create a new category

in the Guinness Book of World's

Records by rolling the biggest

strike in the history of bowling.

TITAN

My thanks to the city planning

commission. This wouldn't have been

possible without them.

TITAN

Tell your friends and family to

tune in right here to this station

at noon tomorrow.

ROXANNE

My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy

the whole business triangle.

90.

ROXANNE

What?

MASTER MIND

My lair is in the direct path of

the ball.

ROXANNE

Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want

anything to happen to your hideout,

would we?

MASTER MIND

You don't understand. I have

certain equipment that's - that's

highly unstable.

ROXANNE

What do you mean?

MASTER MIND

I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,

okay?

ROXANNE

A HYDROGEN reactor?

MASTER MIND

It's experimental - only one in the

world...Well, how do you think I

power all my inventions? Someone

like me can't pay for electricity.

The bills would be outrageous.

ROXANNE

A REACTOR?

MASTER MIND

It creates 100 times the output of

a nuclear one...If destroyed it

could...

ROXANNE

- Vaporize the entire city!

MASTER MIND

(proudly)

Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,

actually. That little baby is

amazing. I'm quite proud of it.

(MORE)

91.

MASTER MIND(cont'd)

(off her deadpan reaction)

I mean...we'd better find a way to

stop him.

MASTER MIND

Did Uberman have a hideout?

ROXANNE

What?

MASTER MIND

A cave, a solitary fortress of some

kind. C'mon, all heros have a place

to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,

it may be our only chance to find

something, a clue, anything that

could give us a fighting chance.

ROXANNE

It's under his house.

MASTER MIND

Whose house?

ROXANNE

Wayne Scott's.

MASTER MIND

Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne

Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy

philanthropist? But he disappeared -

ROXANNE

(interrupting)

He disappeared just over two months

ago when you killed him. Not only

did you rid the world of a hero,

you killed a kind, noble, generous

man.

92.

ROXANNE (CONT'D)

Looks like you got what you always

wanted. Uberman is out of the

picture and Metro City is doomed.

MASTER MIND

"Metro City doomed." You know, I

never thought I'd say something

like this, but here it goes -

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Not if I have anything to say about

it.

MASTER MIND

Such a dark place for one such as

you. I wonder, underneath your

noble deeds, what inner demons

drove you to your endless crusade

for justice?

MASTER MIND

Good lord, man. You've only been

dead for two months.

93.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

A disguise so simple, it's

ingenious. No wonder I never caught

on.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Two lives, yet in both you were an

ideal. Perhaps it was you who was

victorious in the end, old friend.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

I'll miss how predictable you were.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Hello? Anyone here...besides..all

the BIG MEN who are with me now?

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

(to himself)

What's the worst you're gonna find?

(MORE)

94.

MASTER MIND(cont'd)

The man was a boy scout, not a

serial killer.

DOMINATRIX IN FILM

YOU ARE A WORM!

FAT MAN IN FILM

PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!

MASTER MIND

Ahhhhhh!

WAYNE SCOTT

Jesus!

WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)

What the hell are you doing here?

95.

MASTER MIND

I might just ask you the same

question. I had thought I

incinerated you.

WAYNE SCOTT

You scared the bejesus out of me.

How'd you figure out I was still

alive? Wait, how do you know my

identity!?

MASTER MIND

Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,

I forgot to line the bottom of the

copper cage - Somebody pointed that

out to me recently. Figured if they

could do it, so could you. But one

thing I couldn't figure out -

WAYNE SCOTT

The skeleton? Something I

"borrowed" from a medical school a

few months before.

MASTER MIND

A few months? How long had you been

planning this?

WAYNE SCOTT

I always planned to retire -

eventually. I mean, come on, you

can't do this sort of thing in your

fifties. You'd just look

ridiculous.

MASTER MIND

I see it all so clearly now.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)

You must have done it just seconds

before the observatory exploded.

96.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)

You bore out from under the cage.

Then, using your Uber-Speed, -

MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)

- you made your way to safety,

where you had the skeleton safely

hidden away somewhere.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D)

Then you must have flown to a safe

distance and waited for the

explosion, then...

WAYNE

Man, you ARE smart.

MASTER MIND

But why fake your death? Why go

through all of it? You could have

just quit.

WAYNE SCOTT

But the responsibility would still

be there.

(MORE)

97.

WAYNE SCOTT(cont'd)

A cop can retire and stop handing

out speeding tickets - but people

expect more from superheroes. I

tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt

in Zimbabwe without everyone

expecting me to do something about

it. I figured, out of sight, out of

mind.

MASTER MIND

And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to

disappear?

WAYNE SCOTT

Both of my lives have so much

baggage. It's time for new baggage,

you know?

MASTER MIND

I just can't believe it. This whole

time you've been in hiding while a

force of great evil is tearing your

city apart?

WAYNE SCOTT

I don't want to hear about it.

That's why I don't have a

television in here to remind me of

all the things I SHOULD be doing.

Hell, I could get a wife to do

that.

MASTER MIND

There's a demented supervillain out

there about to destroy our - I

mean, your city.

MASTER MIND

You're really going to do nothing?

WAYNE SCOTT

Good and evil have a way of

balancing themselves out. If this

guy is as bad as you say, somebody

will rise up to fight him. It's

just the order of things. You found

me, didn't you?

98.

WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)

I know it's hard, but you'll find

someone else someday.

MASTER MIND

You're the only one who can stop

him.

WAYNE SCOTT

Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a

plane to catch.

MASTER MIND

A plane?

WAYNE SCOTT

Going to Barbados for a little

change in climate. Now, if you'll

excuse me, I got to go pack.

WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)

You were a good foe. I'm sorry if

I've let you down. If it makes a

difference, you were the best foe a

hero could ask for.

MASTER MIND

Not smart enough to come up with a

full-proof trap.

WAYNE SCOTT

Well, you did almost have me when

you figured out my weakness was

copper. Now that made me sweat a

little. Took me way too long to

drill out from under that cage.

MASTER MIND

I got lucky.

WAYNE SCOTT

Anyway, it's a good thing for my

sake that I could always count on

you for an out.

99.

MASTER MIND

(suddenly confused)

What do you mean?

WAYNE SCOTT

C'mon, we always threw each other a

couple of bones. You would always

leave me an out in one of your

`full-proof' traps, and I'd never

had you incarcerated at a

penitentiary that you couldn't

eventually escape from. It kept our

little game going.

MASTER MIND

Game? - Was that all this ever was

to you? You know, I was trying my

best every time I fought you. Those

`outs' as you call them were

unintentional.

WAYNE SCOTT

Oh.

MASTER MIND

I guess I was never really a match

for you, was I?

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

(thoughtfully)

Then how can I expect to be one for

Titan?

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

What about Roxanne?

WAYNE SCOTT

I think we both got what we wanted

out of our relationship. She got a

career out of me, and I got plenty

of other things out of her. But I'm

ready to move on to greener

pastures.

100.

MASTER MIND

I guess I wasn't the villain I

thought I was, and you...you

weren't the hero I thought you

were.

WAYNE SCOTT

Roxanne! How long have you been...

ROXANNE

Long enough.

ROXANNE (CONT'D)

Don't you have something else you

can go do?

TITAN

Alright, I want this whole thing to

look ESPN professional, understand?

101.

TITAN (CONT'D)

You guys are about to get some good

footage. I might need a little

room, though.

TANK LOUDSPEAKER

Titan, we have orders from the city

of Metro to take you into custody.

If you do not give your self up

willingly, we will be forced to

open fire.

TANK LOUDSPEAKER

What is your answer?

TITAN

(to beer)

Miss me?

102.

TITAN (CONT'D)

Didn't mean to get you involved in

all of this.

TITAN (CONT'D)

Hey, man! You killed my suds!

TITAN (CONT'D)

That's one was for you, beer.

TITAN

Guys, please tell me you got that

last bit.

BRAD HELMS

Huh?

TITAN

You're kidding me. I give you my

sexiest moves and you mean to tell

me it was for nothing?

BRAD HELMS

We were afraid something might hit

us.

TITAN

Looks like I've given the story of

the century to the wrong man.

103.

TITAN

Wait. What about that other

reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on

the topper half, but killer legs.

BRAD HELMS

Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a

much better reporter than I am. You

want her.

TITAN

Where can I find her.

FRANK

We're actually not supposed to give

out that sort of information.

BRAD HELMS

1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe

she lives in a penthouse.

TITAN

You've been very helpful.

MASTER MIND

Hurry, we must be on our way as

soon as possible.

DA VINCI

Master, why must we flee?

MASTER MIND

I told you, Titan is too powerful.

If he's set on destroying us,

there's precious little we could do

about it.

DA VINCI

Where are we going?

104.

MASTER MIND

To another city, someplace with a

shitload of superheroes to fight.

We'll start over, we'll go back to

doing what we do best.

PLATO

With our tails between our legs?

MASTER MIND

Plato, do you have a better plan?!

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Hello...Roxanne?

ROXANNE

What are you going to do about

Tighten?

MASTER MIND

Right now I'm packing, later I'll

have a snack on the train.

ROXANNE

You're running away?

MASTER MIND

In a word - yes.

ROXANNE

You created this monster...

MASTER MIND

I didn't create this - the god's of

irony did and I am eating the crow

I so richly deserve.

ROXANNE

There's no time for self pity.

105.

MASTER MIND

I'll make the time.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

You can leave with us. You'll be

safe.

ROXANNE

I'm not going anywhere.

MASTER MIND

Will you listen to me, no one can

stop him.

ROXANNE

You have to try. The city needs

your help.

MASTER MIND

I'm afraid you have an inflated

opinion of me.

ROXANNE

What the hell's happened to you?

The Master Mind I knew would never

have run from a fight even though

he knew deep in his heart that he

didn't have a chance in hell of

winning it. It was your best

quality. You need to be that man

right now...I...

MASTER MIND

What?

ROXANNE

(heart felt)

I believe in you.

MASTER MIND

Sweet words, but that man is dead.

Please, Roxanne, just come with me.

ROXANNE

No...I guess you are a coward after

all.

106.

TITAN

Man, have I got a story for you.

MASTER MIND

Roxanne? Roxanne?

TITAN

What pose would be best? The corny

folded arms thing?

TITAN

Or maybe on the hips, like this.

TITAN

No, makes me look like a flamer

pirate.

FRANK

(whispering)

Shouldn't we be making a run for it

right about now?

ROXANNE

(whispering)

The guy can outrun bullets. I don't

think either one of us is in that

kind of shape.

TITAN

She's right, Frank.

107.

TITAN

Also got super hearing. I promise

not to keep the both of you long,

but you'll thank me when this is

all over.

MASTER MIND

Dad, it's me...

(he looks around to make

sure no one can hear)

...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked

in a while, and I'm sorry. It's

been a little crazy trying to live

up to a legacy.

MASTER MIND

Anyway...You raised me to be the

worst that I could possibly be. And

I've tried to live up to that as

best as I could - even dropping out

of dentistry school like you wanted

me to. But I'm about to do

something now that would really

piss you off. I'm going to go

against everything you ever taught

me. I hope...I hope that maybe

you'll look down at what I'm about

to do as not so much a good deed,

but more like the outright defiance

of a hateful and ungrateful, son.

If you could do that, then maybe -

in your own little way - you could -

for probably the first time - find

a reason to be proud of me.

108.

MASTER MIND

Well...either way, you're probably

going to see me real soon.

(calling over his

shoulder)

Men?

PLATO AND DA VINCI

Yes Sir?

MASTER MIND

Stop packing. Our work is not

finished here.

PLATO AND DA VINCI

YES SIR!

REPORTER

We interrupt your regular afternoon

programming to show you live

footage of a potential dangerous

situation in downtown Metro. The

former hero knows as Titan is

placing what appears to be a giant

ball...

REPORTER

Hold on...It appears our own

Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the

scene. We now go to her with a live

report.

DA VINCI

Sir, I think you should see this!

CUT TO:

109.

ROXANNE

I'm here with the cause of the

destruction in Metro City. He has

kidnapped me and a cameraman to

chronicle what he refers to as the

creation of a monument to his

invincibility and overall

"Asskickiness." He will use this

giant concrete bowling ball to play

the largest game of bowling ever

using the buildings of downtown

Metro City as his pins.

TITAN

And I'm going for the biggest

strike ever.

TITAN

And you, Metro City, have a

ringside seat as I cement my name

in the anal of history.

ROXANNE

Annals.

TITAN

What?

ROXANNE

Nevermind.

TITAN

(in quiet professional

bowler announcer voice)

Like Tiger before him, a young

savior has come to raise a sport

from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart,

a young man with a dream, realizing

that dream here today, folks.

(MORE)

110.

TITAN(cont'd)

One might click there heels and say

"There's no place like home" upon

finding themselves in such a

fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much

at home right were he is - with a

ball in hand and glory in his

sights.

ROXANNE

Hal, I know everyone treated you

like shit, but you don't have to do

this.

TITAN

You're right. I don't HAVE to do

anything. Isn't that cool?

TITAN

Here's one for the record books!

111.

TITAN (CONT'D)

What the...?

FRANK

Look, what's that flying in the

air?

MASTER MIND

C'mon, slow down

MASTER MIND

C'mon.

MASTER MIND

Gutterball!

TITAN

YOU!

MASTER MIND

Bowling? What other trailer park

sports can you play?

112.

TITAN

You are becoming a real pain in my

ass. I should have done this a long

time ago.

MASTER   MIND (CONT'D)

(into walkie   talkie)

Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,

he's falling for   it.

TITAN

What the hell?

TITAN (CONT'D)

GODAMNIT!

MASTER MIND

Shit! Stupid monkeys and their

fruit.

113.

TITAN (CONT'D)

No more games.

MASTER MIND

Could it really be that easy--

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

Didn't think so.

TITAN

If you don't mind, I'm going to

punch trough your face now.

MASTER MIND

I'm alive.

MASTER MIND

Uberman?

114.

BYSTANDER 1

It's Uberman!

BYSTANDER 2

Uberman's alive!

BYSTANDER 3

We're saved!

MASTER MIND

I thought.

UBERMAN

So did I.

UBERMAN

Thank you, old enemy.

MASTER MIND

For what?

UBERMAN

Showing me the error of my ways,

Showing me I'm meant to be this

city's savior, showing me that,

while we can try, there is no

running away from our true destiny.

TITAN

Oh...Did I interrupt something?

TITAN

Where you going, buddy?

115.

TITAN (CONT'D)

Welcome to Paintown. Population:

you.

TITAN (CONT'D)

Time to finish this.

MASTER MIND

WAIT!!!

TITAN

What?

MASTER MIND

Quick joke - What's the capital of

Thailand?

TITAN

Huh - I don't know.

MASTER MIND

It's bang cock!

TITAN (CONT'D)

Ow.

MASTER MIND

So, I guess pennies are good for

something.

116.

ROXANNE

Pretty strange, huh?

MASTER MIND

They're cheering for me.

ROXANNE

You saved them. You saved

everybody. How's it feel?

MASTER MIND

It's a...it's nice, you know? I

usually don't get a lot of

feedback.

(whispering)

But I also kind of caused all this.

What happens when they find that

out I was the cause of some of

this?

ROXANNE

What they don't know won't hurt

them.

MASTER MIND

I guess that is all in the past.

ROXANNE

You're the hero.

MASTER MIND

I don't think I'd go that far...I

mean I just...er...

ROXANNE

Master Mind?

117.

MASTER MIND

Yes?

ROXANNE

Stop talking.

SAMANTHA SUMMERS

Who's bad? Well, not Master Mind.

It seems the former villain has

done a career 180 after defeating

Tighten and saving Metro City from

certain enslavement. And here he is

getting a full pardon by Metro

City's Mayor, Steve Dent.

MAYOR

Ahhh!

MASTER MIND

Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.

MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

We're okay, right?

118.

BRAD HELMS

And what about Tighten? Is there a

prison in existence that can hold

this super powered menace? Well,

the answer we found is no.

PRISON SCIENTIST

Of course normally he could break

out of there anytime, but as you

can see we've taken some special

precautions.

BRAD HELMS

What is a Hero? It seems never has

that question needed to be asked

more than it does tonight. We go to

our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making

her triumphant return to our news

desk for the answer.

ROXANNE

What is a hero? Well, there are

many different kinds. There are

those who hear a call, like the

policeman or doctor, then there's

the kind the public creates in

their search for meaning and hope.

Then, there are those who have the

courage to change.

THUG #1

Hey, gimme that purse?

119.

MASTER MIND (O.S)

I don't think it would go with your

outfit.

THUG #2

It's Master Mind!

THUG #1

So? It's not like he has any

superpowers.

MASTER MIND

I'm gonna give you a chance to

surrender.

THUG #1

Four against one. For a Master

Mind, you're really bad at math.

MASTER MIND

Way to take out those two goons,

guys!

DA VINCI

What two goons?

120.

MASTER MIND

(apologetically)

Sorry, we're new at this.

THE END
