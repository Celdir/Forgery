Dras, dva, tri ...

MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)

Mer-sa-vich!

MOVER 2 (O.C.)

We're here. Time to muscle up.

MOVER 2 (CONT'D)

(EFFORTS)

Got it? Almost there, just a few more.

Come on, now, LIFT.

DISSOLVE TO:

CORALINE

Hello?...   Who's there?

CORALINE

You scared me to death, you mangy thing!

CORALINE (CONT'D)

I'm just looking for an old well. Know

it?

CORALINE(CONT'D)

Not talking, huh?

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me...

the well!

CORALINE (CONT'D)

(freaked out)

AHHHHH!

CORALINE (CONT'D)

GET AWAY FROM ME--

WYBIE

(OBLIVIOUS)

Hoo! Let me guess, you're from Texas or

Utah; someplace dried out and barren,

right? I heard about water-witching

before but it doesn't make sense; I mean,

it's just an ordinary branch.

CORALINE

(ENRAGED)

IT'S A DOWSING ROD!

WYBIE

Ow!

CORALINE

And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by

PSYCHO-NERDS OR THEIR CATS!

WYBIE

He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral

you know, wild? Of course, I do feed

him every night and sometimes he'll come

in my window `n bring me little dead

things.

CORALINE

(TOUGH)

Look, I'm from Pontiac.

WYBIE

Huh?

CORALINE

MICHIGAN? And if I'm a "water witch",

THEN--

(points stick, stomps foot)

--where's the secret WELL?

WYBIE

You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it!

WYBIE (CONT'D)

See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell

to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a

sky full of stars in the middle of the

day.

CORALINE

(SOFTENS)

Huh.

WYBIE

Surprised she let you move in...

WYBIE (CONT'D)

... my Gramma. She owns the "Pink Palace"

(indicates house in distance)

Won't rent to people with kids.

CORALINE

What do you mean?

WYBIE

(suddenly worried)

Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it.

WYBIE (CONT'D)

I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat.

CORALINE

(SKEPTICAL)

Wybie?

WYBIE

Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of

course. What'd you get saddled with?

CORALINE

I wasn't saddled with anything. It's

Coraline.

WYBIE

Caroline what?

CORALINE

Coraline. Coraline Jones.

WYBIE

(confused, not hearing it)

Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I

heard an ordinary name, like Caroline --

WYBIE (CONT'D)

-- can lead people to have ordinary

expectations about a person--

WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)

(calling from afar)

Wyborne!

CORALINE

I think I heard someone calling you,

Wyborne.

WYBIE

What? I didn't hear anything--

CORALINE

Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were-

you-born.

WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)

Wyborne!

WYBIE

(under his breath, nervous)

Grandma!

WYBIE (CONT'D)

Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan

water witch.

WYBIE (CONT'D)

But I'd wear gloves next time.

CORALINE

(SKEPTICAL)

Why?

WYBIE (CONT'D)

`Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh,

it's poison oak.

CORALINE

Ehh!!

ROTATE DISSOLVE TO:

CORALINE

I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.

MEL

(not listening)

Uh huh.

CORALINE

I would have died.

MEL

(continues typing)

That's nice.

CORALINE

Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's

perfect weather for gardening.

MEL

No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a

mess.

CORALINE

But Mom, I want stuff growing when my

friends come to visit. Isn't that why we

moved here?

MEL

Something like that. But then we had the

accident.

CORALINE

Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.

MEL

I never said it was.

CORALINE

(MUTTERS)

I can't believe it -- you and Dad get

paid to write about plants and you hate

dirt.

MEL

Coraline, I don't have time for you right

now. And you still have unpacking to do.

Lots of unpacking.

CORALINE

That sounds exciting.

Mel (CONT'D)

Oh - some kid left this on the front

porch.

WYBIE (V.O.)

Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's

trunk. Look familiar? Wybie.

CORALINE

(to herself)

Huh... a little me? That's weird.

MEL

What's his name, anyway?

CORALINE

Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.

CORALINE

Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad?

CHARLIE

Hello, Coraline...

(notices doll's reflection)

And... Coraline doll?...

CORALINE

D'you know where the garden tools are?

CHARLIE

It's pouring out there, isn't it.

CORALINE

Humph, it's just raining.

CHARLIE

What'd the boss say?

CORALINE

(MOCKING)

"Don't even think about going out,

Coraline Jones."

CHARLIE

Then you won't need the tools.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Uhhh, you know, this house is a hundred

and fifty years old.

CORALINE

So?

CHARLIE

So explore it!

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Go out and ... count all the doors and

windows and write that down. List

everything blue!

(BEGGING)

Just let me work.

CORALINE

Ewww!

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Ahh!!

CHARLIE

No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--!

CHARLIE (O.S.)

--AAAAAAA!

CORALINE

One boring blue boy in a painfully boring

painting ... four incredibly boring

windows ... and no... more... doors...

CORALINE (CONT'D)

All right, little me, where are you

hiding?

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Huh?

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Hey Mom...

CORALINE (O.S.)

Where does this door go?

MEL

I'm really, really busy!

CORALINE

I think it's locked.

MEL (O.S.)

CORALINE (O.S.)

Pleeeeeeeeease!

MEL

Uhhh...

MEL

Will you stop pestering me if I do this

for you?

MEL (CONT'D)

Fine.

CORALINE

Bricks? I don't get it.

MEL

They must have closed this off when they

divided up the house.

CORALINE

You're kidding? And why is the door so

small?

MEL

We made a deal. ZIP IT!

CORALINE

You didn't lock it.

MEL (O.S.)

AaaaaH!!!

CHARLIE (O.S.)

Oh, my twitchy witchy girl,

CHARLIE

I think you are so nice,

I give you bowls of porridge

And I give you bowls of ice --

CHARLIE

(really bad note)

-- cream!

CORALINE

Why don't you ever cook, Mom?

MEL

Coraline, we've been through this before:

your Dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out

of the way.

MEL (CONT'D)

I swear I'll go food shopping soon as we

finish the catalog.

(indicates Coraline's plate)

Try some of the chard, you need a

vegetable.

CORALINE

Looks more like slime to me.

CHARLIE

Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot --

now what's it going to be?

CORALINE

Think they're trying to poison me?

CORALINE

Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Good-night...little me.

CORALINE

Whoa...

CORALINE

Huh?

CORALINE (CONT'D)

MMMMM, something smells good.

CORALINE

Mom?! What are you doing here in the

middle of the night?

OTHER MOTHER

You're just in time for supper, dear!

CORALINE

You're not my mother.

CORALINE (CONT'D)

My mother doesn't have b-b-buh...

OTHER MOTHER

B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them?

OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

I'm your Other Mother, silly. Now go tell

your Other Father that supper's ready.

OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

Well, go on. He's in his study.

CORALINE

Hello?

OTHER FATHER

Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new

song?

CORALINE

My father can't play piano.

OTHER FATHER

No need to ... this piano plays ME!

OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)

Making up a song about Coraline.

She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal

of mine.

She's as cute as a button in the eyes of

everyone who ever laid their eyes on Cor-

a-line.

OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)

When she comes around exploring

Mom and I will never ever make it boring

our eyes will be on Coraline.

CORALINE

I, uh  sorry  but she said to tell you

the food's ready.

OTHER FATHER

Mmmmm! Who's starving? Raise your hand.

OTHER FATHER

We give our thanks and ask to bless,

Our Mother's golden chicken breast!

CORALINE

Mmmm, this chicken is good.

OTHER MOTHER

Hungry, aren't you.

CORALINE

(nodding, mouth full)

D'you have any gravy?

OTHER MOTHER

Well, here comes the gravy train! Choo-

choo!

OTHER MOTHER

Another roll, sweet peas? Corn on the

cob?

CORALINE

(mouth full)

I'm real thirsty.

OTHER MOTHER

Of course! Any requests?

CORALINE

Mango milk shake?

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Home?

OTHER MOTHER

We've been waiting for you, Coraline.

CORALINE

For me?

OTHER FATHER

Yep. Wasn't the same here without you,

kiddo.

CORALINE

I didn't know I had an Other Mother.

OTHER MOTHER

Of course you do. Everyone does.

CORALINE

Really?

OTHER MOTHER

Uh huh, and soon as you're through

eating, I thought we'd play a game.

CORALINE

(SKEPTICAL)

You mean like, hide and seek?

OTHER MOTHER

Perfect! Hide and seek in the rain.

CORALINE

What rain?

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Huh, what about the mud?

OTHER FATHER

We love mud here!

OTHER MOTHER

Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies -- it's

great for poison oak.

CORALINE

(SUSPICIOUS)

How'd you know I--

CORALINE (CONT'D)

I, I'd love to play, but ... I better get

home to my other mother.

OTHER MOTHER

But I'm your other mother.

CORALINE

(BEFUDDLED)

I mean my other other mother. Mom number

one?

(YAWNS)

I think I should get to bed.

OTHER MOTHER

Of course, sweetheart, it's all made up.

CORALINE

(shakes head)

But ...

OTHER FATHER

Come along, sleepyhead.

CORALINE

Wow.

DRAGONFLIES

Hello Coraline, hello, hello!

TOY SQUID

What's shakin', baby?

CORALINE

Hello.

PHOTO FRIEND 1 (O.C.)

Hey, how zit goin', yuper!

PHOTO FRIEND 2 (O.C.)

(MICHIGAN-SPEAK)

Where's your swampers and tuke?

CORALINE

Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls?

I can't wait till summer. You're both

PHOTO FRIEND 1

We're already here, Coraline --

PHOTO FRIEND 2

CORALINE

Oh, the mud...

PULL BACK MATCH

DISSOLVE:

CORALINE

(GASPING)

It's gone, my poison oak, it's gone!...

CORALINE

(SOFTLY)

Huh?

CORALINE

It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you

weren't really you; you were my other

mother.

MEL

(DISAPPROVING)

Buttons for eyes, huh?

(indicates untouched food)

Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all

that chicken. Take your multi-vitamin, at

least.

CORALINE

You were in the dream too, Dad. You had

wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey

slippers.

CHARLIE

(pretend offense)

Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

(OPTIONAL)

Pssst. Can you get me some of that magic

mud you were talking about?

CHARLIE (CONT'D)

Because I have a terrible case of

writer's rash. On my---.

MEL

If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages

edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP.

MEL (CONT'D)

Coraline, why don't you go visit

downstairs? I bet those "actresses" would

love to hear your dream.

CORALINE

Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said

they're dingbats.

MEL

(NODS)

Uh huh.

CORALINE

Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky...

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Ohh, Poo-eeeee!

CORALINE

H-hello?...

CORALINE (CONT'D)

I think our mail got mixed up.    Should I

leave it outside or...

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Hmmm...

MR. BOBINSKY

SEE-KRET...

MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)

(SCOWLING)

Famous Jumping Mouse Circus not ready,

little girl!

CORALINE

(CONFUSED)

Circus?... Oh, uh, I brought this for

you.

MR. BOBINSKY

(SNIFFS)

Mmmm... Noviseer.

CORALINE

Huh?

MR. BOBINSKY

New "cheese" samples.

MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)

Very clever, using this "mix up" to sneak

my home and peek at meeshkas

CORALINE

Meeshkas?

MR. BOBINSKY

The Mice!

CORALINE

Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.

MR. BOBINSKY

(BOWS)

And I am the Amazing Bobinsky! But you

can call me Mr. B, because amazing I

already know that I am.

MR. BOBINSKY

Ha! You see, Caroline, the problem is my

new songs go oompah oompah. But the

jumping mice play only toodle toot, like

that. Is nice, but not so much amazing?

So now--

(indicates smelly mail)

--I switch to stronger cheese, and soon

VATCH OUT!

MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)

Here, have beet. Make you strong.

(salutes her )

Daas vee DAAN ya, Caroline.

CORALINE

Cor-a-line.

CORALINE

(to herself)

Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot.

MR. BOBINSKY (O.C.)

EHHH! CAROLINE: PA-DAZH-DI'-- WAIT!!

CORALINE

No!!!

MR. BOBINSKY

The mice...asked me to give you message.

CORALINE

The...jumping mice?

MR. BOBINSKY

They are saying: do not go through leetle

door. Do you know such a thing?

CORALINE

The one behind the wall paper? But...

it's all bricked up.

MR. BOBINSKY

Bah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes the

mice are leetle...

MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)

...mixed up, hmmm? They even get your

name wrong, you know. They call you

Coraline instead of Caroline, not

Caroline at all.

MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)

Maybe I work them too hard...

MISS SPINK

(HARSH)

Oh cease your infernal yapping!

(to Coraline, sweetly)

How nice to see you, Caroline. Would you

like to come in? We're playing cards.

CORALINE

Still Coraline, Miss Spink.

MISS SPINK

(over shoulder)

Miriam, put the kettle on!

MISS FORCIBLE

April, I think you're being followed.

MISS SPINK

It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline?

She'll be having the Oolong tea.

MISS FORCIBLE

No, no, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer

Jasmine.

MISS SPINK

No, Oolong.

MISS FORCIBLE

Ah, Jasmine it is, then.

MISS SPINK

Come on, boys!

CORALINE

(ALARMED)

Are those dogs .... real?

MISS SPINK

(SIGHS)

Our sweet, departed angels. Couldn't bear

to part with them ... so we had them

stuffed.

(CONTINUES)

(MORE)

MISS SPINK (CONT'D)

Now, there's Hamish the third, the

fourth, the eighth, the ninth. Angus the

second, the fifth, the..

MISS FORCIBLE

Oh go on, have one  it's hand-pulled

taffy from Brighton  best in the world.

MISS SPINK (O.C.)

...seventh, the third, the ninth, yes,

the fourthI'm right; and Jock Junior,

Jock senior, Jock the third, the

fourth...

MISS SPINK (CONT'D)

...oh, and that's Jock's 2nd cousin,

twice removed.

MISS SPINK (CONT'D)

I'll read them, if you like.

CORALINE

Read what?

MISS SPINK

Oh, your tea leaves, dear. They'll tell

me your future. Drink up then, go on.

MISS SPINK (CONT'D)

No, not all of it, not all of it. That's

right, now hand it over.

MISS SPINK (CONT'D)

Oh... Caroline, Caroline, Caroline; you

are in terrible danger.

MISS FORCIBLE

Oh, give me that cup, April, your eyes

are going.

MISS SPINK

My eyes! You're blind as a bat!

MISS FORCIBLE

Oh, now, ummm... not to worry, child,

it's good news: there's a tall, handsome

beast in your future.

CORALINE

A what?

MISS SPINK

Miriam, oh really, you're holding it

wrong.

MISS SPINK (CONT'D)

See? Danger!

CORALINE

What do you see?

MISS SPINK

(OMINOUS)

I see a very peculiar hand...

MISS FORCIBLE

I see a giraffe.

MISS SPINK

Giraffes don't just fall from the sky,

Miriam.

MISS SPINK (CONT'D)

Oh!

MISS FORCIBLE

Oh, lord!

CORALINE

Well, what should I do?

MISS SPINK

Never wear green in your dressing room.

MISS FORCIBLE

Acquire a very tall step ladder.

MISS SPINK

And be very, very careful. Now, was there

something you came to tell us?

CORALINE

No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea,

though.

MISS FORCIBLE

Toodle-oo.

MISS SPINK

Cheery-bye.

MISS SPINK (CONT'D)

Do you have any nice Queens for mummy?

CORALINE

(to herself)

Danger?

WYBIE

Owwwwwwww!

CORALINE

Great, the village stalker.

WYBIE

Ow. I - I wasn't stalking you. We're

hunting banana slugs.

CORALINE

What d'ya mean, "we?"

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss-

puss!

WYBIE

What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez.

CORALINE

(MOCKING)

Wuss-puss...

CORALINE (CONT'D)

So... that doll. Did you make it look

like me?

WYBIE

Oh no; I found it that way. It's older

than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly.

CORALINE

(points to self)

C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and

raincoat?

WYBIE

Dang, check out Slugzilla!

CORALINE

(FRUSTRATED)

You're just like them.

WYBIE

Huh?

CORALINE

I meant my parents; they don't listen to

me either.

WYBIE

Uh huh... You mind?

CORALINE

Ew!

WYBIE

You know, I've never been inside the Pink

Palace.

CORALINE

(SCEPTICAL)

You're kidding.

WYBIE

Grandma would kill me. Thinks it's

dangerous or something.

CORALINE

Dangerous?

WYBIE

Well... she had a twin sister.

CORALINE

So?

WYBIE (O.C.).

When they were kids, Grandma's sister

disappeared.

(ON CAMERA)

She says she was stolen.

CORALINE (O.S.)

(SKEPTICAL)

Stolen?

CORALINE(CONT'D)

Well, what do you think?

WYBIE

Uhhh, I-I don't know.

WYBIE (CONT'D)

Maybe she just ran away?

WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)

Wyborne!

WYBIE

Look, I gotta go.

CORALINE

Wait a minute!

OTHER MOTHER

Welcome back, darling.

CORALINE

Hi.

OTHER MOTHER

So thoughtful of you to send this nice

cheddar, Coraline.

CORALINE

Cheddar?... Oh, the mice bait...

OTHER MOTHER

Would you go fetch your father?

OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

Bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now!

CORALINE

You mean my Other Father?

OTHER MOTHER

Your better father, dear.   He's out in

the garden.

CORALINE.

But my parents don't have time to garden.

CORALINE

Mmmmmm!

OTHER MOTHER

Go on...

OTHER FATHER

Hey!!!

CORALINE

I love your garden!

OTHER FATHER

Our garden, Coraline!

CORALINE

(GIGGLING)

Oh ah, stop! Stop tickling, ah!

OTHER FATHER

Oops, daughter in distress!

OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)

Tickle no more, you dragon snappers!

CORALINE

Well, she says it's time for dinner ...

breakfast ... food?

OTHER FATHER

Hop on, kiddo, I want to show you

something!

CORALINE

I can't believe you did this!

OTHER FATHER

Mother said you'd like it! Boy she knows

you like the back of her hand.

CORALINE

Mmmm...so good!

OTHER FATHER

I love dinner, breakfast food.

OTHER MOTHER

Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to

come see the Jumping Mice perform after

dinner.

CORALINE

Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it

was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was

wrong.

OTHER FATHER

Well, everything's right in this world,

Kiddo.

OTHER MOTHER

Your father and I will clean up while you

and your friend head upstairs.

CORALINE

My friend?

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were-

you-born.

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Hello?

OTHER MOTHER

I thought you'd like him more, if he

spoke a little less.

(shrugs, smiling)

So I fixed him.

CORALINE

So he can't talk at all?

OTHER MOTHER

Nope.

CORALINE

Hmm, I like it.

OTHER MOTHER

(PROUDLY)

Now run along, you two, and have fun.

CORALINE

You're awful cheerful, considering you

can't say anything.

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she...

CORALINE

Whoa... cool!

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Look at you!

OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)

Lady and gentleman! For to tickle your

eyes and ears and making hearts to thump,

I  Sergei Alexander Bobinsky  am

introducing...

OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)

CORALINE (CONT'D)

It's wonderful, Wybie!

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Wow!

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Yah! Whooo-oooh! That was great!

OTHER MR. BOBINSKY

Very very thank you, lady and gentleman.

CORALINE

We loved it, Mr. B. It was ... so ... so--

OTHER MR. BOBINSKY

(COACHING)

AHHHHHH---

CORALINE

A-mazing!

OTHER MR. BOBINSKY

You are very velcome anytime you like,

PULL BACK MATCH

DISSOLVE:

CORALINE

Ughhh.

CORALINE (V.O.).

... there were garden squash like balloon

animals AND snap dragons.

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Oh, and upstairs I saw a real mouse

circus, not pretend like the crazy man's

in our house.

CHARLIE

You sure you won't come?

MEL

(indicates neck brace)

Don't fret, Charlie, they'll love the new

catalog. At least, they'll love my

chapters.

MEL (CONT'D)

I did not call him crazy, Coraline.   He's

drunk.

CHARLIE

Well, I guess I'll see you around, you

dizzy dreamer.

CORALINE

Da-ad! I'm not five anymore.

YOUNG RASCAL

My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!!

MEL

Put them back.

CORALINE

But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear

boring gray clothes. No one will have

these.

MEL

Put them back.

CORALINE

My other mother would get them.

MEL

Maybe she should buy all your clothes.

CORALINE

So what do you think's in the other

apartment?

MEL

I don't know. Not a family of Jones

imposters.

CORALINE

Then why'd you lock the door?

MEL

(shorter than previous)

Oh, I found some rat crap and... I

thought you'd feel ... safer.

CORALINE

They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams

aren't dangerous; they're the most fun

I've had since we've moved here.

MEL

Your school might be fun.

CORALINE

With those stupid uniforms?   Right.

MEL

Had to give it a try.

MEL

How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup-

salsa wrap for lunch?

CORALINE

Are you kidding me?

MEL

Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway.

Dad's planning something special.

CORALINE

Gross-gusting.

MEL

(BRIGHTENS )

You wanna come along? You can pick out

something you like.

CORALINE

Oh, like the gloves?

MEL

Look, Coraline... if things go well

today, I promise I'll make it up.

CORALINE

That's what you always say.

MEL

Won't be long.

CORALINE

(MUTTERS)

But I might be...

CORALINE

(TRIUMPHANT)

I knew it was real!

OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)

Dearest Coraline,

M

iss Spink and Miss Forcible have invited

you downstairs after lunch. I hope you

like the new outfit I made you! Love,

Mother.

CORALINE

Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at

home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that

talks too much. You must be the Other

Cat.

CAT

No. I'm not the other anything. I'm me.

CORALINE

Um... I can see you don't have button

eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can

you talk?

CAT

I just can.

CORALINE

Cats don't talk at home.

CAT

No?

CORALINE

Nope.

CAT

(DRYLY)

Well, you're clearly the expert on these

things. After all, I'm just a big fat

wuss puss.

CORALINE

Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I

called you that, I really am.

CORALINE (CONT'D)

How'd you get here?

CAT

I've been coming here for a while.

CAT (CONT'D)

It's a game we play. She...

(indicates house)

...hates cats and tries to keep me out.

But she can't, of course.

CAT (CONT'D)

I come and go as I please.

CORALINE

(SKEPTICAL)

The Other Mother hates cats?

CAT

(CONTEMPTUOUS)

Not like any "mother" I've ever known.

CORALINE

What do you mean? She's amazing!

CAT

You probably think this world is a dream

come true. But you're wrong. The Other

Wybie told me so.

CORALINE

That's nonsense. He can't talk.

CAT

Perhaps not to you. We cats, however,

have far superior senses than humans and

can see and smell, and --

CAT (CONT'D)

(WHISPERING)

Shhhh! I hear something! Right ...over...

CORALINE

Hey, Wybie.

CORALINE (CONT'D)

(SHOCKED)

She's practically naked!

OTHER MISS SPINK

I'm known as the siren of all seven seas

The breaker of hearts by the bay.

OTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D)

So, if you go swimmin'

With bow-legged women,

I might steal your weak heart away.

CORALINE

(whisper, to Wybie)

Oh my God.

OTHER MISS FORCIBLE

A big-bottomed sea witch may bob through

the waves,

And hope to lead sailors astray,

But a true ocean goddess,

Must fill out her bodice,

(indicates her ample bosom)

To present an alluring display.

OTHER MISS SPINK

Beware of old oysters, too large in the

chest,

Let's banish them from the buffet.

OTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D)

I'm far more nutritious

OTHER MISS FORCIBLE

You smell like the fishes

OTHER MISS SPINK

Did I hear a banshee?

OTHER MISS FORCIBLE

You're sea-green with envy

OTHER MISS SPINK

This mermaid enchantress,

OTHER MISS FORCIBLE

No, I "Birth of Venus!"

OTHER MISS FORCIBLE

(CONT'D)

Will send sailors swooning --oh--!

OTHER MISS SPINK

Will send sailors swooning --oh--!

CORALINE

(WHISPERS)

I can't look!

OTHER MISS SPINK

Ready to break a leg, Miriam?

OTHER MISS FORCIBLE

Our lives for the theater, April!

YOUNG FORCIBLE

What a piece of work is man!

How noble in reason!

YOUNG SPINK

How infinite in faculty!

In form and moving how express and

admirable!

YOUNG FORCIBLE

In action like an angel!

YOUNG SPINK

In apprehension how like a god!

CORALINE

Ahhh!!!

YOUNG FORCIBLE

The beauty of the world!

YOUNG SPINK

The paragon of animals!

CORALINE

Yeah!!

OTHER FATHER

Hey there.

OTHER MOTHER

Was it wonderful, dear?

CORALINE

Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me

right out of my seat  Spink and

Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies,

that was just a disguise. But then, I was

flying through the air and... it was, it

was magic.

OTHER MOTHER

You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?

CORALINE

(nods, turns back)

Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie.

OTHER MOTHER

You could stay here forever... if you

want to.

CORALINE

Really?

OTHER FATHER

Sure...we'll sing and play games, and

Mother will cook your favorite meals.

OTHER MOTHER

There's one tiny little thing we need to

do.

CORALINE

What's that?

OTHER FATHER

Well, it's a surprise.

OTHER MOTHER

For you ... our little doll.

OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

(SMILING)

Black is traditional, but if you'd prefer

pink or vermillion or chartreuse...

OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

... though you might make me jealous.

CORALINE

NO WAY!

CORALINE (CONT'D)

YOU'RE NOT SEWING BUTTONS IN MY EYES!

OTHER MOTHER

Oh, but we need a yes ... if you want to

stay here.

OTHER FATHER

(ENTHUSIASTIC)

So sharp you won't feel a thi-- Oww!

OTHER MOTHER

There now; it's your decision, darling.

We only want what's best for you.

CORALINE

I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW!

OTHER MOTHER

(WOUNDED)

Bed?

OTHER FATHER

Before dinner?

CORALINE

I'm really, really tired. Yeah...

(fakes huge yawn)

I just need to sleep on things.

OTHER MOTHER

Well of course you do, darling... I'll be

happy to tuck you in.

CORALINE

(palms out, forced smile)

Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so

much already--

OTHER MOTHER

You're welcome. And I

(smiles to Other Father)

we aren't worried at all, darling.

(SOFTLY)

Soon you'll see things our way.

MAGIC DRAGONFLY

CORALINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

CORALINE

Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep...

DISSOLVE:

CORALINE

Mom!... Dad!..

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Oh God, I'm still here?

CORALINE

Hey you! Where's the Other Mother?     I

want to go home.

OTHER FATHER

All will be swell, soon as Mother's

refreshed. Her strength is our strength.

OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)

Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.

CORALINE

If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna

find the Other Wybie. He'll help me.

OTHER FATHER

No point; he pulled a long face...

OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)

...and Mother didn't like it.

CAT

And what do you think you're doing?

CORALINE

Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what

I'M doing.

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the

old well be here?

CAT

Nothing out here ... it's the empty part

of this world. She only made what she

knew would impress you.

CORALINE

But why? Why does she want me?

CAT (cont'd)

She wants something to love, I think.

Something that isn't her... Or maybe

she'd just love something to eat.

CORALINE

Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat

daughters!

CAT

I don't know. How do you taste?

CORALINE

Huh? But how can you walk away from

something and still come back to it?

CAT

Walk around the world.

CORALINE

Small world.

CAT

Hang on--

CORALINE

Stop, he's one of the circus mice!

CAT

I don't like rats at the best of times,

but this one was sounding an alarm.

CORALINE

Gooooood kitty.

OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)

They say even the proudest --

OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

--spirit can be broken ... with love.

OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like

one?

OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar.

CORALINE

I want to be with my real mom and dad. I

want you to let me go.

OTHER MOTHER

Is that any way to talk to your mother?

CORALINE

You aren't my mother.

OTHER MOTHER

Apologize at once, Coraline!

CORALINE

No.

OTHER MOTHER

(TENSELY)

I'll give you to the count of three.

One...

OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

...two...

TALL OTHER MOTHER

...THREE!

CORALINE

Ow, what are you doing!

CORALINE

Ow, that hurts!

TALL OTHER MOTHER

You may come out when you've learned to

be a loving daughter!

CORALINE

(FRIGHTENED)

Who's there?

TALL GIRL GHOST (O.S.)

(WHISPERS)

Hush! And shush! For the Beldam might be

listening!

CORALINE

(WHISPERS)

You ... you mean the Other Mother? ...

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Who are you?

BOY GHOST

(WISTFUL)

Don't remember our names... But I `member

my true mommy...

CORALINE

Why are you all here?

ALL GHOSTS

The Beldam!

SWEET GIRL GHOST

She spied on our lives,

through the little doll's eyes,

BOY GHOST

And saw that we weren't    happy.

TALL GIRL GHOST

So she lured us away,

TALL GIRL GHOST (CONT'D)

with treasures and treats,

SWEET GIRL GHOST

and games to play!

BOY GHOST

Gave all that we asked -

SWEET GIRL GHOST

yet we still wanted more -

TALL GIRL GHOST

So we let her sew the buttons.

BOY GHOST

She said that she loved us,

TALL GIRL GHOST

But she locked us here

ALL GHOSTS

And ate up our lives.

CORALINE

Well, she can't keep me in the dark

forever; not if she wants to win my life.

Beating her is my only chance.

SWEET GIRL GHOST

Perhaps, if you do win your escape, you

could find our eyes?

CORALINE

Has she taken those, too?

SWEET GIRL GHOST

Yes, miss. And hidden them.

BOY GHOST

Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls

will be freed.

CORALINE

I ... I'll try.

CORALINE

(PANTING)

WYBIE?..

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Did she do this to you?

CORALINE (CONT'D)

I hope that feels bet--

OTHER WYBIE

Shhh.

TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)

Coraline? Is that you!

CORALINE

Let's go!

TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)

TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)

mother!!

TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)

CORALINE

Anybody here? Hello, hello, hello! Real

Dad ... Real Mom!

CORALINE

Oh, Mom's groceries!

CORALINE

I missed you guys so much-- You'll never--

CORALINE

Oh... the Wybie that talks...

WYBIE

Huh? Ha ha ha....yeah... Um, so you know

tha-that old doll I gave you?

WYBIE (CONT'D)

Um... my Gramma's real mad, says it was

her sister's - the one that...

disappeared?

CORALINE

(REALIZATION)

You stole that doll, didn't you?

WYBIE.

Well, i-it looked just like you. And I

FIGURED--

CORALINE

It used to look like this pioneer girl;

then Huck Finn junior; then it was this

Little Rascals chick with all these

ribbons, and braids, and....

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Grandma's missing sister!

CORALINE (CONT'D)

I think I just met her. C'mon!

WYBIE

Uh, listen, I-I-I'm really not supposed

TO--

CORALINE

She's in there.

WYBIE

C-can you  can you unlock it?

CORALINE

Not in a million years. But it wouldn't

matter; she can't escape without her

eyes. None of the ghosts can.

WYBIE

Huhhhhhh... So, uh, I really need to get

that doll?

CORALINE

Great! I'd love to get rid of it!

CORALINE

Where are you hiding, you little

monster?!

WYBIE

You and Gramma been talking?

CORALINE

The doll's her spy! It's how she watches

you, finds out what's wrong with your

life!

WYBIE

The doll...is my Gramma's...spy.

CORALINE

NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this

whole world where everything's better -

the food, the garden, the--

(leans in on him)

--neighbors.

CORALINE (CONT'D)

But it's all a trap!

WYBIE

Yeah... Uh, I think I heard someone

calling me, Jonesy.

CORALINE

Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat!

WYBIE

The cat... I-I'll just tell Gramma that

you couldn't find the doll-- OW!

CORALINE

You're not LISTENING TO ME!

WYBIE

That's ... cause ... you're CRAZY!

CORALINE

You creep!

WYBIE

(calling over his shoulder)

Crazy!!

CORALINE

Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave

me the doll!

CORALINE (CONT'D)

Mom!   Dad!

CORALINE

Pick it up, Dad, pick it up.

CHARLIE (V.O.)

Hi!

CORALINE

Just looking ahead dear... Angus hasn't

been feeling very well of late.

MISS FORCIBLE (O.S.)

April? Aren't you getting ready?

MISS SPINK

(looks off camera)

We've lost our ride, Miriam. Caroline

says her parents have vanished, quite

completely.

MISS FORCIBLE

What?! We've waited months for those

tickets.

MISS SPINK

I suppose we could walk!

MISS FORCIBLE

With your gamy legs? It's nearly two

Well,it might help. They're good for bad

MOM!

MOTHER

Darling!

(voice shifting)

Why would you run away from me?

CORALINE

Where are my parents?

TALL OTHER MOTHER

Gosh, I have no idea where your "old"

parents are. Perhaps they've grown bored

of you and run away to France?

CORALINE

They weren't bored of me.   You stole

them!

TALL OTHER MOTHER

Now, don't be difficult, Coraline. Have a

seat, won't you?

TALL OTHER MOTHER

Everybody likes games.

CORALINE

Uh huh.

TALL OTHER MOTHER

What kind of game would it be?

CORALINE)

An exploring game ... a finding things

game.

OTHER MOTHER

And what is it you'd be finding,

Coraline?

CORALINE

My real parents.

TALL OTHER MOTHER

(DISMISSIVE)

Too easy.

CORALINE

And, and the eyes of the ghost children.

TALL OTHER MOTHER

Huh.

TALL OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)

What if you don't find them?

CORALINE

If I lose, I'll stay here with you

forever and let you love me.

And I'll let you sew buttons into my

eyes.

TALL OTHER MOTHER

Hmmm... And if you somehow win this game?

CORALINE

Then you let me go. You let everyone go

my real father and mother, the dead

children, everyone you've trapped here.

TALL OTHER MOTHER

Deal.

CORALINE

Not till you give me a clue.

TALL OTHER MOTHER

Oh, right... In each of three wonders

Too bad you won't have this.
