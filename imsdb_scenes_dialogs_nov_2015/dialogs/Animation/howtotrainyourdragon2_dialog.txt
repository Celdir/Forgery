Final Draft

May 5th, 2014

EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

Hiccup and Toothless BLUR PAST, leaving a wake that leads...

EXT. BERK - DAY

(Sequence 0200 - New Berk)

To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags

and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline.

HICCUP (V.O.)

This... is Berk. The best kept

secret this side of, well,

anywhere. Granted, it may not look

like much, but this wet heap of

rock packs more than a few

surprises.

HICCUP (V.O.)

Life here is amazing, just not for

the faint of heart. See, where most

folks enjoy hobbies like whittling

or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer

a little something we like to call--

HICCUP (V.O.)

DRAGON RACING!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 2.

SNOTLOUT

Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you

want that?

FISHLEGS

Snotlout! That's mine!

SNOTLOUT

Here ya go, babe.

SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)

Did I tell you that you look

amazing today? `Cause you do.

RUFFNUT

Come on, Barf. It's starting to

stink around here.

TUFFNUT

Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow

this place, Belch!

STOICK

That's nine for the Twins, Astrid

lags with three, Fishlegs and

Snotlout trail with NONE!

STOICK (CONT'D)

And Hiccup is... nowhere to be

found. Hmmm.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 3.

GOBBER

Scared him off with the big talk,

didn't ya, Stoick?

ASTRID

What are you doing, Snotlout?!

They're going to win now!

SNOTLOUT

She's my princess! Whatever she

wants, she gets.

ASTRID

Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury

you alive?!

SNOTLOUT

Only for a few hours!

HICCUP (V.O.)

Dragons used to be a bit of a

problem here. But that was five

years ago. Now they've all moved

in. And, really, why wouldn't they?

HICCUP (V.O.)

We have custom stables... all-you-

can-eat feeding stations... a full

service dragon wash...

HICCUP (V.O.)

Even top-of-the-line fire

prevention, if I do say so myself.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4.

STOICK

It's time, Gobber.

GOBBER

Righty-ho!

(aloud, to the crowd)

Last lap!

ASTRID

The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly!

We can still win this thing!

RUFFNUT

Come on, Barf!

TUFFNUT

Let's go!

FISHLEGS

Go, Meatlug!

GOBBER

This is your big moment. Have a

nice flight!

ASTRID

Up, up, up!

ASTRID (CONT'D)

No!

FISHLEGS

Good job, Meatlug!

FISHLEGS (CONT'D)

Here you go, darling. Mine's worth

ten!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 5.

RUFFNUT

Yeah! The Black Sheep!

ASTRID

You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!

RUFFNUT

I'm totally winning!

FISHLEGS

We're winning together!

RUFFNUT

No one can stop me now!

TUFFNUT

Except for me. We're attached,

genius!

TUFFNUT (CONT'D)

Quit trying to steal all my glory!

STOICK

Get `em, Astrid!

TUFFNUT RUFFNUT

ASTRID

Gotcha!

RUFFNUT

Astrid!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 6.

STOICK

Well played! Hahaha!

(gloating, to the crowd)

That's my future daughter-in-law!

SNOTLOUT

Uh, excuse me.

ASTRID

Stormfly!

STOICK

That's thirteen! Astrid takes the

game!

HICCUP (V.O.)

Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect.

All of my hard work has paid off.

And it's a good thing, too, because

with Vikings on the backs of

dragons, the world just got a whole

lot bigger.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 7.

HICCUP

Yeah!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

What do you think, bud? Wanna give

this another shot?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Toothless! It'll be fine.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Ready?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

This is amazing!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

No longer amazing! Toothless!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Oh, no!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

That really came out of nowhere.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

We gotta work on your solo gliding

there, bud. That locked-up tail

makes for some pretty sloppy rescue

maneuvers, eh?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Looks like we found another one,

bud.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Oh, what? Do you want an apology?

Is that why you're pouting, big

baby boo? Well... try this on!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up

on all my heartfelt remorse?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a

ONE-LEGGED--

HICCUP (CONT'D)

You're right! You're right! You

win! You win!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons

and Vikings, enemies again, locked

in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Gaaaaagh!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 10.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

You KNOW that doesn't wash out.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

So what should we name it?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

"Itchy Armpit" it is.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might

find a few Timberjacks in those

woods? The odd Whispering Death or

two in the rocks? Who knows...

maybe we'll finally track down

another Night Fury.

(BEAT)

Wouldn't that be something?

(BURDENED)

So, whaddya say? Just keep going?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 11.

HICCUP

`Afternoon m'lady. Where have you

been?

ASTRID

Winning races. What else? The real

question is... where have YOU been?

HICCUP

Avoiding my dad.

ASTRID

Oh, no. What happened now?

HICCUP

Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake

up. The sun's shining. Terrible

Terrors are singing on the rooftop.

I saunter down to breakfast,

thinking all is right with the

world, and I get...

HICCUP (CONT'D)

(APING STOICK)

... Son, we need to talk.

ASTRID

(APING HICCUP)

Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day

of goofing off to get started.

HICCUP

Okay, first of all, I don't sound

like that. What is this character?

And second... what is that thing

you're doing with my shoulders?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 12.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

A truly flattering impersonation.

Anyway, he goes...

(resuming Stoick's brogue)

You're the pride of Berk, son, and

I couldn't be prouder...

ASTRID

(continuing her impression

OF HICCUP)

Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty

impressed with myself, too.

HICCUP

WHEN have I ever done that with my

hands?

ASTRID

You just did.

HICCUP

Okay... just...

(holding her arms, mock-

STERN)

Hold still. It's very serious.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

(resuming Stoick's brogue)

You're all grown up, and since no

chief could ask for a better

successor, I've decided--

ASTRID

--TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods!

ASTRID (CONT'D)

Hiccup, that's amazing!

HICCUP

You're gonna wear out the spring

coil. The calibration is very

sensitive!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 13.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Yeah, so... this is what I'm

dealing with.

ASTRID

(EXCITED)

What did you tell him?

HICCUP

I didn't. By the time he turned

around, I was gone.

ASTRID

Well, it's a lot of responsibility.

The map will have to wait for sure,

and I'll need to fly Toothless,

since you'll be too busy...

HICCUP

It's not me, Astrid. All those

speeches, and planning, and running

the village... that's his thing.

ASTRID

I think you're missing the point. I

mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be

pretty excited.

HICCUP

I'm not like you. You know exactly

who you are. You always have.

But...

HICCUP (CONT'D)

I'm still looking. I know that I'm

not my father... and I never met my

mother... so, what does that make

me?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 14.

ASTRID

What you're searching for... isn't

out there, Hiccup.

ASTRID (CONT'D)

It's in here.

(BEAT)

Maybe you just don't see it yet.

HICCUP

Maybe. But, y'know... there is

something out there.

ASTRID

(EXASPERATED)

Hiccup...

HICCUP

Stay close.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

What happened here?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 15.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Easy, bud.

ASTRID

Hiccup!

ERET (O.S.)

Fire!

HICCUP

Astrid! Look out!

ASTRID

HICCUP!

ERET

Watch the tail!

ERET (CONT'D)

Tie those legs up!

ERET (CONT'D)

Is that what I think it is?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 16.

HICCUP

STOP!

ASTRID

STORMFLY!

(to the trappers)

What are you doing?

ERET

Back again?

ERET (CONT'D)

Soil my britches... that is a Night

Fury. Thought they were all gone

for good.

(to his fellow trappers)

Looks like our luck's had a turn

for the better, lads! Don't think

Drago has one of those in his

dragon army.

ASTRID

Dragon army?

HICCUP

Look, we don't want any trouble.

ERET

Ha! You should've thought of that

before you stole all of our dragons

and blasted our fort to bits!

HICCUP

Wait...

ASTRID

What are you talking about?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 17.

HICCUP

You think we did this?

ERET

Dragon trapping is hard enough work

as it is, without do-gooder dragon

riders sneaking in to rescue them.

HICCUP

What do-gooder -- there are other

dragon riders?

ERET

You mean, other than your thieving

friend from last night? You tell

me.

ERET (CONT'D)

You may have an ice-spitting dragon

on your side, but we still have a

quota to fill. How do you suppose

we explain this mess to Drago

Bludvist?

HICCUP

Drago what-fist? Does anything you

say make sense?

TEENY

He's expecting a new shipment of

dragons for his army by tomorrow.

NO-NAME

And Drago don't take well to

excuses.

ERET

This is what he gave me last time I

showed up empty-handed. He promised

to be far less understanding in the

future.

HICCUP

(EXASPERATED)

Look, we don't know anything about

a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting

dragon, or your lunatic boss and

his dragon army, okay?

(MORE)

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 18.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Just give us back our dragon, and

we'll go, strange, hostile person

whom we've never met.

ERET

Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret.

Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper

alive.

ERET (CONT'D)

After all, it's not just anyone who

can capture a Night Fury.

HICCUP

And this is Toothless. He says

we're going. Now.

ERET

Heh. They all say that.

(BEAT)

RUSH `EM, LADS!

ASTRID

Stormfly! C'mon, go! Go!

ERET

YOU WILL NEVER HOLD ON TO THOSE

DRAGONS, YOU HEAR ME?! DRAGO IS

COMING FOR THEM ALL!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 19.

STOICK

Any sign of him?

GOBBER

Ah, he's probably flown off the

edge of the world by now. You sure

you want that kid running the

village? You can still delay your

retirement.

STOICK

Oh, he's ready. You'll see.

STOICK (CONT'D)

Haha! There he is!

(to Gobber, proving his

POINT)

Huh? The pride of Berk!

GOBBER

Who finally decided to show up for

work. Yay.

HICCUP

Sorry. Got held up.

(privately, to Stoick)

Hey, Dad, could I have a word?

STOICK

Something you're itching to tell

me?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 20.

HICCUP

Not quite the itch you're thinking

of, but yes.

STOICK

Good man! Now, lesson one. A

chief's first duty is to his

people. So...

STOICK (CONT'D)

Forty one? Forty --

HICCUP

Could we just talk in private for--

STARKARD

--That's me! That's me! I'm next!

(pushing his way through)

I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've

been here all day!

STARKARD (CONT'D)

Okay, I want one of those high

seaters, with lots of spikes and a

big stowage compartment.

STOICK

Absolutely! You got it, sir!

HICCUP

Dad, this is actually a little more

important than building saddles.

STOICK

Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too

small when it comes to serving your

people. Excuse us, Grump.

GOBBER

Grump! You let the forge die down

again!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 21.

GOBBER (CONT'D)

That's it, Grump. You're going up

for adoption!

STOICK

One of these. And this...

HICCUP

DAD --

STOICK

-- There you go! Go on. Have away.

HICCUP

But, seriously, I really need to

tell you about this new land we

came across.

GOBBER

Another one?!

FISHLEGS

Any new dragons?

HICCUP

We didn't stick around to find out.

These folks weren't particularly

friendly.

GOBBER

Oh, really? Your Night Fury and

Deadly Nadder didn't bring them

cheering to the rooftops?

HICCUP

No, this was different. Not the

standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha

I've come to enjoy. These guys were

trappers. Dragon trappers.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 22.

ASTRID

You should've seen their fort. All

blown apart and stuck in giant

spikes of ice. It was weird.

HICCUP

I've never seen anything like it.

And worst of all, they thought we

did it!

GOBBER

Y'know, you two are gonna get

yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one

of these days. Not everyone

appreciates this way of life.

STOICK

Gobber's right, son. Best we keep

to our own. Besides, you'll have

more important uses for your time --

STOICK (CONT'D)

(sing-songy, under his

BREATH)

Once we make the big announcement!

HICCUP

They are building a dragon army.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Or at least the guy they work for

is. Dargo Bloody Fist or something.

TUFFNUT

I'll bloody his fist with my face

if he tries to take my dragon!

RUFFNUT

Or mine.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 23.

TUFFNUT

You're such a moron.

FISHLEGS

A beautiful moron.

SNOTLOUT

Yeah...

STOICK

Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?

HICCUP

Uh, yeah. Wait. You know him?

STOICK

GROUND ALL DRAGONS!

HICCUP

What? Why?!

STOICK

SEAL THE GATES! LOWER THE STORM

DOORS!

HICCUP

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is

happening?

GOBBER

You heard the man! Lock it down!

STOICK

No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off

this island until I give the word!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 24.

HICCUP

Because some guy you knew is

stirring up trouble in some faraway

land?

STOICK

Because Drago Bludvist is a madman.

Without conscience or mercy. And if

he's built a dragon army... gods

help us all.

STOICK (CONT'D)

Get them into their pens! Quickly!

HICCUP

Then let's ride back out there.

We'll follow those trappers to

Drago and talk some sense into him.

STOICK

No. We fortify the island.

HICCUP

It's our duty to keep the peace!

STOICK

Peace is over, Hiccup. I must

prepare you for war.

HICCUP

War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our

dragons, we can't wait around for

him to get here. Let's go find him

and change his mind.

STOICK

Some minds won't be changed,

Hiccup. Berk is what you need to

worry about.

(BEAT)

A chief protects his own.

STOICK (CONT'D)

SECURE THE STABLES! LATCH EVERY

STALL!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 25.

ASTRID

Hiccup, don't.

HICCUP

I have to.

STOICK

THIS WAY! QUICKLY!

STOICK (CONT'D)

HICCUP!

HICCUP

Come on!

STOICK

Hiccup!

ERET

Keep your eyes peeled, lads! With

this wind, we'll reach Drago by

daybreak, so best we fill this ship

up with dragons and quick! It's no

time to be picky. Not if we want to

keep our --

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 26.

UG

Uh... Eret?

ERET

HEADS! OFF THE PORT QUARTER!

ERET (CONT'D)

Net `em, lads! Take `em down!

ERET (CONT'D)

You're not getting away this time.

ERET (CONT'D)

And here I was worried we might

turn up empty-handed.

HICCUP

Nope. It's your lucky day. We give

up.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

That's one Night Fury, one Deadly

Nadder, and...

HICCUP (CONT'D)

... two of the finest dragon riders

west of Luk Tuk. That oughtta make

the boss happy, right?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Excuse us.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 27.

ASTRID

What are you doing?

HICCUP

Toothless, stay.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

The dragons don't really care for

cramped spaces, so they'll just

hang out with you. They won't be

any trouble.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Unless you do that. Wooden boat,

big ocean. How's your swimming?

NO-NAME

Not good.

HICCUP

Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have

armed prisoners!

ASTRID

How is this a plan?

HICCUP

Just what every dragon trapper

needs. One end coats the blade in

Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The

other sprays Hideous Zippleback

gas. All it takes is a spark and...

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 28.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Oh, yeah, there you go!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Once they see you as one of their

own, even the testiest dragons can

be trained, right, bud?

ERET

Give me that!

ERET (CONT'D)

What game are you playing?

HICCUP

No game. We just want to meet

Drago.

ERET

Why?

HICCUP

Because I'm going to change his

mind about dragons.

ASTRID

He can be really persuasive.

HICCUP

Once you've earned his loyalty,

there is nothing a dragon won't do

for you.

ERET

Puh! You won't be changing any

minds around here.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 29.

HICCUP

I can change yours. Right here.

Right now.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

May I?

ERET

Dragon riders!

HICCUP

Put me down! Snotlout! What are you

doing?

SNOTLOUT

See how well I protect and provide?

TUFFNUT

Aggh! What is with all the nets?!

RUFFNUT

Hey watch it! That was close...

TRANSITION TO:

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 30.

RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

Oh, my.

RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

Me likey.

RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

Take me.

ASTRID

HOLD YOUR FIRE!

HICCUP

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?!

GOBBER

We're here to RESCUE you!

HICCUP

I DON'T NEED to be rescued!

STOICK (O.S.)

ENOUGH!

ERET

Well, didn't you just pick the

wrong ship, eh? I am Eret, son of --

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 31.

ERET (CONT'D)

(panting, suffocated)

Get... this... thing... off... me!

GOBBER

Anyone else?

GOBBER (CONT'D)

That's what I figured.

STOICK

(TO HICCUP)

You. Saddle up. We're going home.

HICCUP

No.

STOICK

Of all the irresponsible --

HICCUP

-- I'm trying to protect our

dragons and stop a war! How is that

irresponsible?

STOICK

BECAUSE WAR IS WHAT HE WANTS, SON!

STOICK (CONT'D)

Years ago, there was a great

gathering of chieftains to discuss

the dragon scourge we all faced.

FLASHBACK

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 32.

STOICK (V.O.)

Into our midst came a stranger from

a strange land, covered in scars

and draped in a cloak of dragon

skin. He carried no weapon and

spoke softly, saying that he, Drago

Bludvist, was a man of the people,

devoted to freeing mankind from the

tyranny of dragons.

STOICK (V.O.)

He claimed that he alone could

control the dragons and that he

alone could keep us safe, if we

chose to bow down and follow him.

RUFFNUT

Stupid.

TUFFNUT

Good one.

STOICK

Aye. We laughed, too...

STOICK (CONT'D)

Until he wrapped himself in his

cloak and cried out, "Then see how

well you do without me!"

STOICK (V.O.)

The rooftop suddenly burst into

flames, and from it, armored

dragons descended, burning the hall

to the ground.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 33.

STOICK

(STINGING REGRET)

I... was to only one to escape.

STOICK (CONT'D)

(TO HICCUP)

Men who kill without reason cannot

be reasoned with.

HICCUP

Maybe.

STOICK

Hiccup...

HICCUP

I'm still going to try.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

This is what I'm good at. And if I

could change your mind... I can

change his, too.

(TO TOOTHLESS)

Come on.

ASTRID

Let's go.

STOICK

NO! Lead the others back to Berk.

I've had enough mutiny for one day.

RUFFNUT

Ooh, I like that.

STOICK

Ruffnut!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 34.

RUFFNUT

(PETULANT)

Ugh! Okay!

HICCUP

Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let

anything happen to you. I promise.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

AW, COME ON, DAD! REALLY?!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

(ALARMED)

Okay.

(TO TOOTHLESS)

No sudden moves.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 35.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Hold on, hold on.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Toothless!

HICCUP

HEY! YOU LEFT MY DRAGON BACK THERE!

HE CAN'T FLY ON HIS OWN! HE'LL

DROWN!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 36.

HICCUP

We have to head back for my dragon!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Who are you? The Dragon Thief?

Drago Bludvist?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Do you even understand what I'm

saying?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 37.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Toothless!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

It's okay. I'm glad to see you,

too, bud. You really had me worried

there.

WARRIOR

(whispered, shaken)

Hiccup?

(BEAT)

Could it be? After all these years?

How is this possible?

HICCUP

Uh, should I... should I know you?

WARRIOR

No. You were only a babe...

VALKA

... but a mother never forgets.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 38.

VALKA (CONT'D)

Come...

STOICK

Boar-headed! Just like his mother!

She could never stay put either.

GOBBER

Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking.

I mean, could there be a worse

combination? Ha! When I think of

how stubborn and senseless YOU were

back in the day... well, not much

has changed, actually.

STOICK

You know what he's like. He won't

give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup

finds Drago, before we find him...

GOBBER

Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so

long as that Night Fury's around.

It's a Night Fury!

STOICK

Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 39.

HICCUP

Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come

back here!

VALKA

This way. Come.

HICCUP

You can't just say something like

that and run off! You're my

mother?! I mean, what the -- do you

grasp how INSANE it sounds?!

(BEAT)

I have questions!

VALKA

Come. Quickly!

HICCUP

Where have you been all this time?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

What've you been doing?! They said

you were dead! Everyone thinks you

were eaten by...

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 40.

HICCUP

This is where you've been for

twenty years?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

You've been rescuing them.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Unbelievable.

VALKA

You're not upset?

HICCUP

What? No. I don't know. It's a bit

much to get my head around, to be

frank. It's not every day you find

out your mother is some kind of

crazy, feral, vigilante dragon

lady.

VALKA

At least I'm not boring... right?

HICCUP

I suppose there is that...

(feeble, trailing off)

... one... specific... thing...

VALKA

Do you like it?

HICCUP

I don't have the words.

VALKA

Can I... ? He's beautiful!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 41.

VALKA (CONT'D)

Incredible. He might very well be

the last of his kind.

VALKA (CONT'D)

And look, he's your age! No wonder

you get along so well.

VALKA (CONT'D)

And retractable teeth? Ah!

How did you manage to--

HICCUP

--I found him in the woods. He was

shot down and wounded.

VALKA

This Snafflefang lost his leg to

one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps.

This Raincutter had her wing sliced

by razor netting. And this poor

Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree

snare... then left to die alone and

scared.

(re: Toothless' tail)

And what of this? Did Drago or his

trappers do this, too?

HICCUP

Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm

actually the one who shot him down.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

It's okay though. He got me back.

(playfully, to Toothless)

Right, bud? You couldn't save all

of me, could you? You just had to

make it even. So... peg leg!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 42.

VALKA

What did your father think of your

Night Fury friend?

HICCUP

He didn't take it all that well.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

But then... he changed. They all

did. Pretty soon everyone back home

had dragons of their own.

VALKA

If only it were possible.

HICCUP

No, really, I --

VALKA

-- Believe me, I tried, as well.

But people are not capable of

change, Hiccup. Some of us... were

just born different.

FLASHBACK

VALKA (V.O.)

Berk was a land of kill or be

killed, but I believed peace was

possible.

VALKA

Stop! You'll only make it worse!

VALKA (V.O.)

It was a very unpopular opinion.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 43.

VALKA

Hiccup!

FLASHBACK CONTINUED

VALKA (V.O.)

One night, a dragon broke into our

house, finding you in the cradle.

VALKA (V.O.)

I rushed to protect you, but what I

saw... was proof of everything I

believed.

VALKA (V.O.)

This wasn't a vicious beast, but an

intelligent, gentle creature, whose

soul reflected my own.

STOICK

Valka, run!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 44.

VALKA

Don't!

STOICK

Hold on!

VALKA (O.S.)

No! Stoick!

STOICK

VALKA!

VALKA

(DISTANT)

Stoick!

STOICK

Valka...

MATCH CUT TO:

PRESENT DAY

VALKA

You and your father nearly died

that night, all because I couldn't

kill a dragon.

HICCUP

Yeah, it runs in the family.

VALKA

It broke my heart to stay away, but

I believed you'd be safer if I did.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 45.

HICCUP

How did you survive?

VALKA

Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm

me. He must've thought I belonged

here...

VALKA (CONT'D)

In the home of the great

Bewilderbeast. The alpha species.

One of very few that still exist.

(BEAT)

Every nest has its queen, but this

is king of all dragons.

VALKA (CONT'D)

With his icy breath, this graceful

giant built our nest. A safe haven

for dragons everywhere.

HICCUP

Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's

responsible for all that

destruction?

VALKA

He protects us. We all live under

his care. And his command.

VALKA (CONT'D)

All but the babies, of course...

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 46.

VALKA (CONT'D)

... who listen to no one.

VALKA (CONT'D)

I've lived among them for twenty

years, Hiccup, learning their ways,

discovering their secrets...

VALKA (CONT'D)

He likes you.

HICCUP

Wow.

VALKA

You must be hungry.

HICCUP

Uh, yeah. I could eat.

VALKA

Good. It's feeding time.

ASTRID

I don't like it. They should've

been back with Hiccup by now.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 47.

RUFFNUT

I don't like it either. Eret son of

Eret was the man of my dreams. My

everything!

SNOTLOUT

But, baby, I grew facial hair for

you.

FISHLEGS

Me, too.

ASTRID

What if Drago shot them down? What

if they need our help?

(RESOLUTE)

We have to find them.

FISHLEGS

(NERVOUSLY)

What? But Stoick said...

ASTRID

It doesn't matter what he said, if

they've all been captured. Come on!

NO-NAME

Do we go back?

ERET

We've nowhere to go! Nothing to

sell! And no heads to call our own,

if we don't turn up with dragons

and fast --

ASTRID

Careful what you wish for!

UG (O.S.)

ERET SON OF ERET!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 48.

ERET

What is this?!

ASTRID

A kidnapping.

RUFFNUT

Yay! Can he ride with me? Can he?

Can he?

ASTRID

You're gonna show us the way to

Drago.

ERET

And help dragon riders sneak into

Drago's camp? Just kill me now.

ASTRID

That can be arranged. Stormfly,

drop it.

ASTRID (CONT'D)

Good girl! Stormfly, fetch.

ERET

ALL RIGHT! OKAY! I'LL TAKE YOU TO

DRAGO!

ASTRID

Works every time.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 49.

BEGIN MONTAGE

HICCUP

Hey, I thought we were going to

eat?

VALKA

(with a mischievous grin)

Oh, we are.

HICCUP

And from Dragon Island, I found

this archipelago...

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 50.

VALKA

When I'm up here, I don't even feel

the cold. I just feel...

HICCUP

Free.

VALKA

This is what it is to be a dragon,

Hiccup.

HICCUP

It's all well and good to call

yourself a dragon.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

But can you fly?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 51.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Oh no. Toothless!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Man! Almost! We just about had it

that time!

VALKA

Incredible.

HICCUP

Well, not bad yourself.

VALKA

All this time, you took after me.

And where was I?

(REMORSEFUL)

I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start

over? Will you give me another

chance?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 52.

VALKA (CONT'D)

I can teach you all I've learned,

these past twenty years. Like...

VALKA (CONT'D)

Now you can make those tight turns.

HICCUP

Did YOU know about this?

VALKA

Every dragon has its secrets.

VALKA (CONT'D)

And I'll show them all to you.

We'll unlock every mystery, find

every last species, together, as

mother and son.

(BEAT)

This gift we share, Hiccup... it

bonds us. This is who you are, son.

Who we are. We will change the

world for all dragons! We will make

it a better, safer place!

HICCUP

That sounds... amazing.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

This is so great! Now you and I can

go talk to Drago -- together!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 53.

VALKA

What? There's no talking to Drago.

HICCUP

But we have to --

VALKA

-- No. We must protect our own.

VALKA (CONT'D)

Now come on, we should be getting

back.

ERET

Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now

get this thing off me!

ASTRID

Never take a toy from a dragon.

Don't you know anything?

ERET

(STRAINED)

Gah! Why does this keep happening

to me?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 54.

ASTRID

What's down there?

FISHLEGS

Large diameter bubbles, massive

lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm

thinking class five leviathan,

maybe six.

HICCUP

Meatlug! What's wrong, girl?

ERET (O.S.)

DRAGO!

ERET (CONT'D)

Get off me!

ERET (CONT'D)

Always great to see you, my friend!

Keeping warm up here?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 55.

ERET (CONT'D)

Well, as you can see, I'm right on

time with a new batch of dragons,

just like I promised.

SOLDIER #1

Watch out! He's waking up! Keep him

steady!

SOLDIER #2

Give me some backup here!

DRAGO

Drop the ropes.

SNOTLOUT

Hookfang!

RUFFNUT

Hey!

ASTRID

What are you doing?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 56.

DRAGO

(quiet, to the dragon)

You belong to me now.

ERET

And as an added bonus, I also

caught you their riders. No extra

charge.

ASTRID

What?! Are you kidding me?!

RUFFNUT

But you were so perfect!

ERET

Turns out, there's a whole bunch of

them out there. They --

DRAGO

How many?

ASTRID

Drago doesn't have them after all.

DRAGO

HOW MANY?!

ASTRID

Hundreds! A whole island full!

ERET

I wouldn't worry about it. My men

are hunting them down as we speak.

They won't know where you're

hiding. I promise you that.

ASTRID

Oh, yes they will!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 57.

ASTRID (CONT'D)

They know we're missing and they

have tracking dragons. If you so

much as touch us, Hiccup is gonna

KICK --

DRAGO

-- Hiccup?

ERET

He's not a problem. Really. Trust

me.

ASTRID

He's only the son of Stoick the

Vast...

ASTRID (CONT'D)

... his heir to the throne of

Berk... and the greatest dragon

master this world has ever seen!

DRAGO

Dragon master? I ALONE control the

dragons!

TUFFNUT

Nope.

FISHLEGS

Sorry!

ASTRID

And unless you let us go, right

now, he will blast through here on

his Night Fury and blow your entire

fleet of ships to splinters!

RUFFNUT

Then they'll be crying like babies!

SNOTLOUT

Funny and beautiful.

FISHLEGS

Good one, babe!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 58.

TUFFNUT

Yeah. Like babies. They always cry.

Real tiny ones...

DRAGO

First there was one rider. And now

all of Berk.

(TO ERET)

And YOU led them to me.

ERET

Drago!

DRAGO

CEASE ALL PREPARATIONS! WE MUST

ATTACK THE DRAGONS RIDER'S NEST AT

ONCE!

(SAVORING IT)

WE WILL TAKE DOWN THEIR ALPHA...

AND THEN WE WILL TAKE BERK!

ERET

You're overreacting!

DRAGO

And get rid of him.

ERET

Drago, please...

ASTRID

STORMFLY!

ASTRID (CONT'D)

NO!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 59.

HICCUP

(DETERMINED)

Well, bud, we can't wait around for

Drago to attack this place. We've

gotta find him first. Let's go.

STOICK

Easy now.

HICCUP

Are you kidding me? How'd you get

in here?

STOICK

The same way we're getting you out.

HICCUP

We?

GOBBER

All clear!

STOICK

Toothless. Come.

HICCUP

Dad! There's something you need to

know!

STOICK

Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.

HICCUP

This isn't an on-the-way kind of

update, actually...

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 60.

STOICK

I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.

HICCUP

... more of the earth-shattering

development variety.

STOICK

Yeah, just add it to the pile.

HICCUP

Dad, unlike most surprises I spring

on you, this is one you'll like. I

promise! You just have to handle it

delicately, so...

GOBBER

Uh, you might want to take this

one. Oh, boy.

HICCUP

Dad, can you put the sword away...

please?

VALKA

(RATTLED)

I know what you're going to say,

Stoick. How could I have done this?

Stayed away all of these years. And

why didn't I come back to you? To

our son.

VALKA (CONT'D)

Well, what sign did I have that you

could change, Stoick? That anyone

on Berk could?

(MORE)

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 61.

VALKA (CONT'D)

I pleaded so many times to stop the

fighting, to find another answer,

but did any of you listen?

GOBBER

This is why I never married.

(BEAT)

This and one other reason.

VALKA

(TEARFUL)

I know that I left you to raise

Hiccup alone... but I thought he'd

be better off without me. And I was

wrong, I see that now, but...

VALKA (CONT'D)

Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go

on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING!

STOICK

You're as beautiful as the day I

lost you.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 62.

SNOTLOUT

Could this day get any worse?

TUFFNUT

Uh, let me see. You'll jump into

freezing cold water and then die

from drowning.

ERET

Looks refreshing.

ERET (CONT'D)

Please, ladies first.

ASTRID

You are a steaming heap of dragon --

ERET

-- Duck.

SOLDIER

Warn the others!

RUFFNUT

Get `em, you son of an Eret!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 63.

RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

Okay, I love you again.

TUFFNUT

Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump.

ERET

So? Are we going to save your

dragons and get out of here or not?

ERET (CONT'D)

Check every trap. They're here

somewhere.

ASTRID

Meatlug?

ON ERET

ERET

Anyone coming?

RUFFNUT

I don't know. You just keep doing

what you're doing. Keep crankin'...

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 64.

ERET

Thank you for saving my life.

(BEAT)

Now let me return the favor.

AFTERNOON

HICCUP

Mom, you'd never recognize it!

Where we used to make weapons, we

now build saddles, wing slings --

we even fix dragon teeth! You

wouldn't believe how much

everything's changed!

STOICK

Our son's changed Berk for the

better. I think we did well with

this one, Val.

HICCUP

Thanks, Dad.

VALKA

I'm... a little out of practice.

STOICK

(SWEETLY)

Well, y'know... I didn't marry you

for your cooking.

GOBBER

(to Hiccup and Grump)

I hope not. Her meatballs could

kill more beasts than a battle axe.

(MORE)

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 65.

GOBBER (CONT'D)

I've still got a few knocking

around in here. Ha ha!

HICCUP

And once you move back in, with all

of your dragons, Drago won't even

stand a chance. Everything will be

okay!

STOICK

Slow down, son. It's a lot to take

in.

HICCUP

Oh. Gotcha.

GOBBER

Oh, I love this one!

STOICK

(WHISPERED)

Remember our song, Val?

STOICK (CONT'D)

(SINGING SOFTLY)

I'll swim and sail on savage seas,

with ne'er a fear of drowning. And

gladly ride the waves of life, if

you will marry me.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 66.

STOICK (CONT'D)

(SINGING)

No scorching sun, nor freezing cold

WILL --

GOBBER

(SINGING)

-- will stop me on my journey!

(catching himself,

EMBARRASSED)

Sorry.

STOICK

(SINGING)

If you will promise me your

heart...

STOICK (CONT'D)

And love...

VALKA

(SINGING)

And love me for eternity.

VALKA (CONT'D)

(SINGING)

My dearest one, my darling dear,

you mighty words astound me. But

I've no need of mighty deeds, when

I feel your arms around me.

STOICK

(SINGING)

But I would bring you rings of

gold. I'd even sing you poetry.

(MORE)

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 67.

STOICK (CONT'D)

And I would keep you from all harm,

if you'd stay here beside me.

VALKA

(SINGING)

I have no use for rings of gold. I

care not for your poetry. I only

want your hand to hold. I only want

you near me.

GOBBER

C'mon, Hiccup!

VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER

(SINGING)

To love and kiss, to sweetly hold.

For the dancing and the dreaming.

Through all life's sorrows and

delights, I'll keep your love

inside me.

VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER (CONT'D)

(SINGING)

I'll swim and sail through savage

seas, with ne'er a fear of

drowning. And gladly ride the waves

of life, if you will marry me!

GOBBER

(SINGING)

I'm still going...

HICCUP

Gobber!

GOBBER

I'm done.

STOICK

Ah... I thought I'd have to die

before we'd have that dance again.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 68.

VALKA

No need for drastic measures.

STOICK

For you, my dear... anything.

STOICK (CONT'D)

Will you come home, Val? Will you

be my wife once again?

STOICK (CONT'D)

We can be a family! What do you

say?

VALKA

Yes!

GOBBER

Great! I'll do the cooking!

STOICK

Thank Odin you didn't listen to me,

son. We never would have found each

other.

HICCUP

Toothless?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

What's happening?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 69.

HICCUP

Oh, no...

STOICK

Val! It's all right, it's all

right. We're a team now.

(BEAT)

Now what do you want to do?

VALKA

We have to save the dragons.

STOICK

(DETERMINED)

Aye. You got it!

STOICK (CONT'D)

Come on, son.

DRAGO

Whatever comes, keep hitting the

mountain! We need to draw the alpha

out.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 70.

DRAGO (CONT'D)

Ready the traps!

TUFFNUT

Surprise! Yeah!

DRAGO

WHAT?!

ASTRID

You really are full of surprises.

ASTRID (CONT'D)

Let's go!

TUFFNUT

Dragon Riders coming through!

DRAGO

CUT THEM DOWN!

RUFFNUT

Eret, son of Eret!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 71.

ASTRID

Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's

it! Look out!

ARCHER

Take `em down!

GOBBER

Heads up!

DRAGO

Dragon Master.

HICCUP

Welcome aboard, dragon rider!

ERET

Thanks. I think.

ASTRID

Where have you been?

HICCUP

Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 72.

ERET

Whoa...

ASTRID

That's your mother?!

HICCUP

Well, now you know where I get my

dramatic flair.

DRAGO

The alpha! Now we have a fight!

HICCUP

There! Come on, Toothless! Show

them what you got, bud.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Thatta boy!

DRAGO

I've waited a long time for this!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 73.

VALKA

You cannot take our dragons! They

are controlled by the alpha!

DRAGO

(SMUG)

Then it's a good thing I brought a

challenger.

HICCUP

(HORRIFIED)

Another one?

FISHLEGS

I WAS WAY OFF! THAT IS A CLASS TEN!

CLASS TEN!

VALKA

No. No.

DRAGO

Come on! Take down the alpha!

VALKA

Thank you.

STOICK

For you, my dear... anything.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 74.

STOICK (CONT'D)

Val, do you think you can stop

them?

VALKA

I'll do my best! Come on,

Cloudjumper!

DRAGO

You... I watched you burn!

STOICK

It takes more than a little fire to

kill me!

GOBBER

Stoick!

VALKA

No!

DRAGO

We've won.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 75.

DRAGO (CONT'D)

Now finish her!

STOICK

No!

STOICK (CONT'D)

Hold on!

STOICK (CONT'D)

Skullcrusher, go! Come on, Gobber!

GOBBER

Right behind ya, Stoick!

HICCUP

STOP! Stop!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 76.

DRAGO

This... is the great dragon master?

The son of Stoick the Vast? What

shame he must feel.

HICCUP

All of this loss, and for what? To

become unstoppable? To rule the

world?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Dragons are kind, amazing creatures

that can bring people together.

DRAGO

Or tear them apart.

DRAGO (CONT'D)

You see, I know what it is to live

in fear. To see my village burned,

my family taken.

DRAGO (CONT'D)

But even as a boy, left with

nothing, I vowed to rise above the

fear of dragons and liberate the

people of this world.

HICCUP

Then why a dragon army?

DRAGO

(grinning, smug)

Well, you need dragons to conquer

other dragons.

HICCUP

Or maybe you need dragons to

conquer people.

(BEAT)

To control those who follow you...

and to get rid of those who won't.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 77.

DRAGO

Clever boy.

HICCUP

The world wants peace. And we have

the answer, back on Berk. Just let

me show you.

DRAGO

NO! Let ME show YOU.

STOICK

What...?

STOICK (CONT'D)

(PANICKED)

Hiccup!

STOICK (CONT'D)

Come on, Gobber!

GOBBER

Okay, change of plans.

DRAGO

No dragon can resist the alpha's

command. So he who controls the

alpha, controls them all.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 78.

HICCUP

Toothless? You okay, bud? What's

going on?

DRAGO

Witness true strength. The strength

of will over others. In the face of

it, you are nothing.

HICCUP

Uh, what did he just tell you?

ON STOICK

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Toothless, what's the matter with

you? What're you doing?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Knock it off! Stop! Snap out of it!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Toothless! No! Toothless! Don't!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 79.

STOICK

Hiccup!

HICCUP

STOP!

STOICK

SON!

HICCUP

DAD! NO!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Dad!

VALKA

Stoick...

HICCUP

No... you...

HICCUP (CONT'D)

No! Get away from him!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 80.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

GO ON! GET OUT OF HERE! GET AWAY!

VALKA

It's not his fault. You know that.

VALKA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Good dragons under the control of

bad people do bad things.

DRAGO

GATHER THE MEN AND MEET AT BERK!

HICCUP

Toothless!

VALKA

No, don't!

DRAGO

Move out!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 81.

GOBBER (V.O.)

May the Valkyries welcome you, and

lead you through Odin's great

battlefield. May they sing your

name with love and fury, so that we

might hear it rise from the heights

of Valhalla... and know that you've

taken your rightful place at the

table of kings.

GOBBER (V.O.)

For a great man has fallen. A

warrior. A chieftain. A father. A

friend.

HICCUP

I'm sorry, Dad.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

I'm not the chief that you wanted

me to be. And I'm not peacekeeper I

thought I was. I don't know...

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 82.

VALKA

You came early into this world. You

were such a wee thing. So frail, so

fragile. I feared you wouldn't make

it.

VALKA (CONT'D)

But your father... he never

doubted. He always said you'd

become the strongest of them all.

(BEAT)

And he was right.

(BEAT)

You have the heart of a chief and

the soul of a dragon. Only you can

bring our worlds together. That is

who you are, son.

HICCUP

I was so afraid of becoming my dad.

Mostly because I thought I never

could. How do you become someone

that great? That brave? That

selfless?

(BEAT)

I guess you can only try.

(to the others)

A chief protects his own. We're

going back.

TUFFNUT

Uh, with what?

RUFFNUT

He took all the dragons.

HICCUP

Not all of them.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 83.

RUFFNUT

Fly straight!

FISHLEGS

I don't want to die!

TUFFNUT

We can't fly these things!

FISHLEGS

Yeah, no kidding!

ASTRID

But won't that Bewilderbeast just

take control of these guys, too?

HICCUP

They're babies. They don't listen

to anyone!

TUFFNUT

Yeah, just like us!

GOBBER

This... is... very dangerous!

GOBBER (CONT'D)

Some might suggest this is poorly

conceived.

HICCUP

Well, it's a good thing that I

never listen.

GOBBER

So what IS your plan?!

HICCUP

Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 84.

GOBBER

Heads up!

HICCUP

And that thing.

HOARK

Ah, that's a good boy!

HOARK (CONT'D)

Watch the furniture! Where are you

going?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 85.

DRAGO

Your chief is dead.

DRAGO (CONT'D)

No one can protect you now.

HICCUP

No...

FISHLEGS

He took all the dragons!

HICCUP

(FUMING)

Distract the alpha. Try to keep his

focus off of Toothless.

TUFFNUT

Uh... how?

ERET

Have you forgotten who you're

riding with?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 86.

ERET (CONT'D)

There isn't a dragon alive that I

can't wrangle!

ERET (CONT'D)

Except for this one!

SNOTLOUT

Amateur.

VIKING #1

Look, it's Hiccup!

DRAGO

What?

RUFFNUT

Keep `em coming!

SNOTLOUT

Black sheep, baby!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 87.

SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)

Ten points!

SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)

Uh-oh...

FISHLEGS

I'm okay!

DRAGO

You certainly are hard to get rid

of. I'll say that.

HICCUP

Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me.

I'm right here. Come back to me.

DRAGO

He is not yours anymore. He belongs

to the alpha!

DRAGO (CONT'D)

But, please, oh great dragon

master, try to take him. He will

not miss a second time.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 88.

HICCUP

It wasn't your fault, bud. They

made you do it.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

You'd never hurt him.

(BEAT)

You'd never hurt me.

DRAGO

How are you doing that?

HICCUP

Please. You are my best friend,

bud.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

My best friend.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Thatta boy! That's it! I'm here!

DRAGO

No!

HICCUP

Yeah!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 89.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Hang on!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Almost there, buddy. Almost there!

DRAGO

Do something!

HICCUP

We need to get those two apart.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

We gotta block him out, Toothless.

Do you trust me, bud?

HICCUP (CONT'D)

We can do this. You and me. As one.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

That's it. Now let's try this one

more time!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 90.

ASTRID

Take them down, babe!

VALKA

Go get `em.

DRAGO

Take control of it!

HICCUP

Shut it out, Toothless!

DRAGO

STOP THEM!

HICCUP

NOW!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 91.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Not again.

(BEAT)

TOOTHLESS! IT'S NOW OR NEVER!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Come on, bud!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Hold on!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Yeah! We did it!

DRAGO

Agghh!

HICCUP

Hold him there Toothless!

HICCUP (CONT'D)

It's all over now.

DRAGO

(GRINNING KNOWINGLY)

Or is it?

HICCUP

Oh, no!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 92.

VALKA

No! No...

HICCUP

He's challenging the alpha!

VALKA

To protect you.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 93.

DRAGO

No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight!

FIGHT!

DRAGO (CONT'D)

(to the defecting dragons)

What's the matter with you?

HICCUP

Now do you get it? This is what it

is to earn a dragon's loyalty.

(BEAT)

Let this end now.

DRAGO

Never! Come on!

DRAGO (CONT'D)

FIGHT! BLAST THEM!

HICCUP

The alpha protects them all.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 94.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

You never cease to amaze me, bud.

Thank you.

HICCUP (CONT'D)

Toothless! You know that doesn't

wash out.

ASTRID

Stormfly!

GOBBER

Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy!

FISHLEGS

Who's my little princess?

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 95.

FISHLEGS (CONT'D)

I missed you so much!

SNOTLOUT

Don't you ever leave again,

Hookfang!

RUFFNUT

Oh Barf!

RUFFNUT (CONT'D)

Not you.

ERET

That was some pretty fine dragon

wrangling back there. You'd make a

good trapper.

HICCUP

Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need

somebody to look after him now.

ERET

Me?

ERET (CONT'D)

I'd be honored.

VALKA

Your father... he'd be every bit as

proud as I am.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 96.

HICCUP

Thank you. I'm really glad you're

here, Mom.

VALKA

And here I'll stay.

ASTRID

See? I told you it was in here.

HICCUP

Ha, ha. Still doing that one?

That's hilarious.

(THEN)

Come here, you.

GOBBER

Ooh.

GOBBER (CONT'D)

The chief has come home!

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 97.

HICCUP (V.O.)

This... is Berk. A bit trampled and

busted and covered in ice, but it's

home. It's our home.

HICCUP (V.O.)

Those who attacked us are

relentless and crazy. But those who

stopped them? Oh, even more so!

HICCUP (V.O.)

We may be small in numbers, but we

stand for something bigger than

anything the world can pit against

us.

HICCUP (V.O.)

We are the voice of peace. And bit

by bit, we will change this world.

HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 98.

HICCUP (V.O.)

You see, we have something they

don't. Oh sure, they have armies

and they have armadas...

HICCUP (V.O.)

But we... we have...

HICCUP (V.O.)

OUR DRAGONS!
