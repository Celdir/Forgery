The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror

Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong).

We CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking

BEAVIS (O.C.)

Butt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!

BEAVIS

Butt-Head, wake up, wake up!

BUTT-HEAD

Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score.

Huh huh.

BEAVIS

Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!

BUTT-HEAD

What's gone?

BEAVIS

The TV.

BUTT-HEAD

Uuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,...

BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)

Whoa! I think I just figured something

out Beavis.

BEAVIS

What?

BUTT-HEAD

This sucks.

BEAVIS

Yeah, heh heh.

BUTT-HEAD

This sucks more than anything that

has ever sucked before. We must find

this butt-hole that took the TV.

ANNOUNCER

Beavis!

BEAVIS

Freeze, butt-wipe!

ANNOUNCER

Butt-Head!

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh. Come to Butt-Head, baby.

ANNOUNCER

Star in...

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh. That was cool.

BUTT-HEAD

Dammit, it's stuck.

BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)

Huh huh huh. That was cool.

BEAVIS

Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this

thing back to the house.

VAN DRIESSEN

Ah, excuse me boys. What's going on

here?

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, someone stole our TV.

BEAVIS

Yeah. We're just gonna use this one.

Get outta the way. Heh heh.

VAN DRIESSEN

I'm afraid that TV belongs to the school.

Mmmkay? You know, this could be a positive

experience for you guys. There's a

wonderful world out there when we discover

we don't need TV to entertain us.

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh. He said "anus."

BEAVIS

(to himself)

Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh

heh. Anus. Heh heh.

VAN DRIESSEN

(frustrated)

Have you guys heard a word I've said?

BUTT-HEAD

Yeah, "anus." Huh huh huh huh.

VAN DRIESSEN

Look, guys, just take the TV back to the

A.V. room right now. And try to be a little

more open-minded. Mmkay?

BUTT-HEAD

What a dork. Huh huh.

BEAVIS

Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh. That was cool.

BEAVIS

No it wasn't!

BUTT-HEAD

Uh,...Oh yeah.

McVICKER

Why.... You... You bastards... Ge...

get out! You're suspended. One more

screw up... and you're expelled.

BUTT-HEAD

Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't

know Anderson had a Camper.

BEAVIS

Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV.

Heh heh. TV.

MARCY

Oh, hello. Are you guys here to look

at the refrigerator?

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, no.

BEAVIS

We're here to look at the TV. Heh heh.

MARCY

Oh, I didn't realize it was broken.

Come on in.

BUTT-HEAD

Cool. Huh huh huh.

TOM

Well that oughtta hold her. Ya know,

the most important thing you can have

on a camper is a good propane regulator,

and this here's the best one they make.

MARCY

I sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed

before we leave.

TOM

Now Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip

our whole lives and we're gonna go come

Hell or high water...

TOM (CONT.)

What the hell is that noise?

BEAVIS

AAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!

BUTT-HEAD

Beavis, you butt-hole! You broke it.

TOM

Hey, what's goin' on here?

MARCY

They're here to fix the TV, Tom.

TOM

The TV ain't broken.

BUTT-HEAD

Yeah it is. Huh huh huh.

TOM

Hey wait a minute. You two look kinda

familiar. Ain't you them kids that've

been whackin' off in my tool shed?

BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh huh huh.

BEAVIS

Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.

BUTT-HEAD

What's your problem Beavis?

BEAVIS

I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!

BEAVIS

(crazed)

Heh heh. TV. Heh Teee Veee.

McVICKER

Please mmm... may I have another?!

McVICKER (CONT.)

Beavis and Butt-Head! Y...y...you

bastards.

BEAVIS

Can we watch your TV?

McVICKER

Y... Y... You're expelled! Get out!

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh. That was cool.

BEAVIS

Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing

everything!

MUDDY

...Are you sure these guys can pull this

off? It's gotta look like an accident...

MUDDY (CONT.)

Hold on a minute. That must be them now.

I'll call you back. (Hangs up phone)...

Come in!

BEAVIS

(sounding suddenly sedated)

Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.

MUDDY

Yer late.

BUTT-HEAD

Why? Did we miss American Gladiators?

MUDDY

Well, Earl said you guys were young, but

jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get

the job done. So what are your names?

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, Butt-Head.

BEAVIS

Beavis.

MUDDY

That's alright. I'd rather not know your

real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm

gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you

ten grand plus expenses, all payable after

you do her...

BUTT-HEAD

(full of innuendo)

Do her? Huh huh.

MUDDY

That's right. I'm offering you ten grand

plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?

BEAVIS

Actually, we just wanna watch TV...

BUTT-HEAD

Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your

wife.

BEAVIS

(trembling)

Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!

BUTT-HEAD

Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us

to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay

us. We can buy a new TV.

BEAVIS

Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.

BUTT-HEAD

(to Muddy)

Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.

MUDDY

Okay, then let's get down to business.

MUDDY (CONT.)

Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't

as sweet as she looks. She stole everything

from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll

do you twice as fast as you'd do her.

BUTT-HEAD

Whoa, huh huh. Cool.

MUDDY

She's holed up in a hotel room in Las

Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of

hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the

airport.

BUTT-HEAD

Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.

BEAVIS

Can we watch some TV first?

MUDDY

No.

MUDDY

One more thing. Mah wife's got this

leather satchel. It's black, about this

big. I need ya to bring it back. It's

real important. Sentimental value... Any

questions so far?

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?

MUDDY

She sure does.

BUTT-HEAD

This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.

BEAVIS

Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!

MUDDY

Just make sure it looks like an

accident...

BEAVIS

(spastic)

Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an

accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.

MUDDY

Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have

a drink on it.

BUTT-HEAD

We're gonna get paid to score.

BEAVIS

Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna

get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.

BUTT-HEAD

Beavis, this is the greatest day of

our lives. Huh huh huh.

DOLORIS

Hi. Can I help you find your seats?

BUTT-HEAD

Uuh, nah. These seats are OK.

DOLORIS

I think your tickets have you seated

in row fourteen, coach. So why don't

you just go ahead and move back, OK?

BUTT-HEAD

That's OK. Someone else can have those.

BEAVIS

Yeah, it's not that important to me,

really. Those seats are too small anyways.

DOLORIS

Here you are.

BUTT-HEAD

Hey Beavis. When she was leading us down

here, huh huh, she touched my butt. Huh

huh huh.

MARTHA

Hello there. Are you two heading for Las

Vegas?

BEAVIS

Yeah, we're gonna score.

MARTHA

I hope to score big there myself. I'm

mostly going to be doing the slots.

BEAVIS

Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too.

Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in

Las Vegas?

MARTHA

Oh, there are so many slots you won't

know where to begin.

BEAVIS

Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick

is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be

tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.

BUTT-HEAD

Cool. Huh huh huh.

MARTHA

It's so nice to meet young men who are so

well mannered.

BEAVIS

Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a

big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!

MARTHA

Oh, that's nice.

CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)

(through P.A.)

Good morning. This is your captain

speaking. Welcome aboard flight 151

non-stop to Las Vegas. We ask that you

turn your attention to the front of the

cabin for pre-flight safety instructions.

ATTENDANT'S VOICE

To fasten your seat belt, insert the free

end into the coupling.

BUTT-HEAD

Insert. Huh huh huh.

BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)

Uh...

TAMMY (O.C.)

Hi, I'm Tammy? Can I help you with that?

TAMMY (CONT.)

There you go. You're all set.

BUTT-HEAD

(stunned)

I love you.

BEAVIS

Wait, I wanted her to do it.

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.

CAPTAIN'S VOICE

Flight attendants, please prepare for

take-off.

BEAVIS

Hey wait a minute. What's going on?!

BEAVIS (CONT.)

(screams)

Aaaagh! We're gonna die!!!!!

MAN

D'ya hear that? Something must be wrong!

WOMAN

Oh my God!!!!!!!

BUTT-HEAD

Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.

BEAVIS

Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all

gonna die!

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, huh huh... could you, like, do that

thing with my belt again?

BEAVIS

I'm probably going to make out with her

first before we, you know, get down...

MARTHA

You'll have to speak up son. I have this

ringing in my ears. My doctor says it

could be related to my heart

palpitations. I've had two operations on

my heart.

BEAVIS

Really? I poop too much.

MARTHA

Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.

BEAVIS

Uh... No, (louder) I poop too much. Then

I get tired.

MARTHA

Well, if you find yourself getting tired,

take a couple of these.

MARTHA (CONT.)

They perk me right up.

BEAVIS

Heh heh, thanks.

BEAVIS (CONT.)

(strange)

Uh, tastes like crap. Heh heh. Mmmmm.

BUTT-HEAD

(to Tammy)

So, uh huh huh, are you going to Las

Vegas? Huh huh huh.

TAMMY

Hi, we're serving dinner. Our selections

tonight are chicken piccata or seafood

gumbo...

BEAVIS (O.S.)

Piccata? Piccata! Picattatta tatta!

PASSENGER

Does the gumbo have corn in it?

BEAVIS

I am Cornholio! I need picatta for

my bunghole!

TAMMY

You'll have to wait your turn sir.

BEAVIS

Are you threatening me? My bunghole

will not wait!

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, I got a beer. Want some? Huh huh.

BEAVIS

Bargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!

BUTT-HEAD

AAAAAHHH!!! Huh huh. AAAAHHH!!!

CAPTAIN

Get the hell out of the cockpit!

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh, you said...

CAPTAIN

NOW!!!

ATTENDANTS

Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh. That was cool.

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?

BEAVIS

Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be

casinos and lights and stuff.

BEAVIS (CONT.)

Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding

a sign?

BUTT-HEAD

Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check

this out.

B&B

Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.

DRIVER

Ah, excuse me. You wouldn't know where

I can find these guys, would ya?

BUTT-HEAD

(reads)

Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...

BEAVIS

(reads)

Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.

BUTT-HEAD

(realizes)

Huh huh. This says Beavis.

BEAVIS

And Boot-Head.

BUTT-HEAD

That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it,

Beavis. These dudes have the same name as

us.

BEAVIS

Yeah, we should party.

DRIVER

This way, sirs.

BEAVIS

So where's those guys?

ROSS

Where the hell is he?

HARLAN

You sure this is the right place?

HARLAN (CONT.)

You Muddy?

MUDDY

(slurring)

You the cops?

ROSS

Uh, no. Earl sent us. You know, to take

care of your wife...

MUDDY

What the hell?!... What about those other...

ROSS

Huh?

MUDDY

Dammit!!! She did it to me again!!!

HARLAN

Hey, I noticed your TV was broken. You

wanna buy a new one?

MUDDY

I'm gonna go to Vegas and kill all

three a' them!

HARLAN

Just leave it. Worthless piece o' crap.

ROSS

Yeah, really. We gotta start stealin'

from rich people.

Note: I would like this to be a well-known band (Red Hot

Chili Peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern Las

Vegas lounge act. I think a song like "What Am I Gonna Do

With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like

"Bicostal" by Peter Allan would be cool. Or maybe Sinatra's

"You Make Me Feel So Young" would be best.

BUTT-HEAD

Beavis. This is what it's all about.

BEAVIS

(speechless)

Heh heh. Yeah.

B&B

(in awe)

Huh huh huh huh huh.

BELLBOY

I'm so sorry about that little

misunderstanding. We didn't know you

were registered guests. Here's some

playing chips compliments of...

BEAVIS

This remote's too heavy!

BELLBOY

Sir, it's attached to the...

BUTT-HEAD

Here, dumbass! Let me try!

ELEVATOR VOICE

Ninth floor, going down.

B&B

Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

BUTT-HEAD

Going down. Huh huh huh.

BEAVIS

Ow! These chips suck.

BUTT-HEAD

What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find

that chick.

DEALER

13. We have a winner. (to Beavis) Sir,

your chips?

BEAVIS

I don't want 'em! Keep 'em.

DEALER

Let it ride!

BUTT-HEAD

(to dealer)

Uh... could you help us find a chick?

DEALER

(uneasy)

Sir, the casino does not partake in that

kind of activity.

DEALER (CONT.)

(amazed)

13! Winner!

CHERYL

Excuse me, boys. Did I hear you say

you're looking for a date?

CHERYL (CONT.)

I'm Cheryl, and I can show you a real

fine time.

CHERYL (CONT.)

A time you'll remember for the rest of

your lives, if you know what I mean.

DEALER

(to Beavis)

Sir, do you want your chips?

BEAVIS

No, Dammit! I don't want any chips!

DEALER

Let it ride.

CHERYL

What say we three go up to your room,

take off our clothes and just see what

comes up.

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

BEAVIS

Uh... Uh...

DEALER

14. No winners.

CHERYL

Hmmmm. Oh well.

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh. That chick was talking

about doing it.

BEAVIS

Heh heh. This is the best night of our

lives.

WOMAN ATTENDANT

Good evening. Room service. How may

I help you?

B&B

(on phone)

Huh huh huh huh huh.

WOMAN ATTENDANT

Hello... Hello...

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, huh huh, I'd like to be serviced...

B&B

Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, I wonder where this door goes to.

BEAVIS

(excited)

Hey, Butt-Head, it's her! Heh heh.

DALLAS

BUTT-HEAD

DALLAS

BUTT-HEAD

DALLAS

BUTT-HEAD

DALLAS

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, ten uh...

DALLAS

Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a

better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll

pay ya twenty if you go back there and do

mah husband.

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No

way.

BEAVIS

(considering it)

Umm,... I don't know Butt-Head. That is

a lot of money... Maybe if we close our

eyes and pretend he's a chick...

DALLAS

(panics)

Damn! You boys, you wait right there.

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.

BEAVIS

Me first! Me first!

DALLAS

DALLAS (CONT.)

BEAVIS

DALLAS

BEAVIS

Ow, let go, Butt-Head!

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh.

DALLAS

You wait here.

BEAVIS

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh. No way, dude.

DALLAS

Don't wear yourselves out, boys. Save

some energy for me.

B&B

Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

BUTT-HEAD

This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're

finally gonna score.

BEAVIS

Heh heh. Thank God.

DALLAS

I'm gonna do it with both of ya.

B&B

(uncontrollable)

Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh

huh huh huh huh huh.

DALLAS

(sexy) Boys... (shouts) Boys!!!

DALLAS (CONT.)

But first, you hafta do a little job for

me. (touches seductively) Would you like

to do a job for me?

DALLAS (CONT.)

Here's what it is. I want ya to take a bus

ta Washington, D.C. That's all. And when

ya get there, I'll be waitin'. You're

faces) And I'm gonaa give you everything!

B&B

(near comatose)

Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.

DALLAS

Until then... (tosses Beavis' pants in his

face) Keep your pants on.

DALLAS (CONT.)

OK guys, time to move out.

DALLAS

Remember, Washington, D.C. You'll get

more money than you ever dreamed of. And

DALLAS (CONT.)

(urgent)

Your bus is downstairs. Get going.

B&B

Huh huh huh huh huh.

BUTT-HEAD

This is gonna be cool. Huh huh.

BUTT-HEAD

No way butt-hole! I want the window.

BEAVIS

Cut it out butt-hole!

A VOICE

Why don't you take turns?

BEAVIS

Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the

plane!

MARTHA

Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?

BEAVIS

Uh, we didn't score yet.

MARTHA

Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.

BUTT-HEAD

Cool, huh huh huh.

MARTHA

That's why I'm bussing it across America.

I'm so glad you're here. (to man in next

seat) Jim, I want you to meet two nice

boys.

MARTHA (CONT.)

This is Travis and Bob... What's your

last name, dear?

BUTT-HEAD

Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's

Butt. Huh huh huh.

JIM

Pleased to meet ya, Mr. Head.

MARTHA

Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed.

And Doreen.

BUTT-HEAD

Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.

FLEMMING

So, are you going to tell us where it is

or am I going to have to have Agent Hurley

over there give you another cavity search?

DALLAS

Ooh is that a promise?

FLEMMING

Look Mrs. Scum, we know who you are. Tell

her Bork.

BORK

Dallas Grimes. Married to Muddy Grimes.

You run a mom and pop arms smuggling ring.

DALLAS

Oh, you got my bad side.

FLEMMING

Three days ago you pulled a job at the

Army Research Facility in Hadley, Nevada -

where you stole... (reads) The X-5 unit.

Now we happen to know you had the unit

with you when you checked in here, so why

don't you be a good girl and tell us where

it is.

DALLAS

You gonna charge me with anything? (pause)

I didn't think so. You wanna let me go now

or wait 'till my lawyer files a wrongful

arrest.

BORK

(aside to Flemming)

We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place

apart. We can only legally hold her for

another couple of hours.

FLEMMING

(aside to Bork)

Dammit! (slams fist down) Where's that

damn unit??!!

BEAVIS

Heh heh. We're in Washington!

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh. We're gonna score now.

MARTHA

Actually, we're at the Hoover Dam.

BUTT-HEAD

Damn, huh huh.

BEAVIS

Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!

BEAVIS

So, like, where is she?

BUTT-HEAD

(looks around)

Yeah, really.

HOOVER GUIDE

Over 40 thousand cubic tons of concrete

were used in the construction of the

Hoover Dam.

B&B

Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

HOOVER GUIDE

From top to bottom, this dam is 51

stories.

BEAVIS

Uh, huh huh, excuse me. Is this a God

Damn?

B&B

Huh huh huh huh huh.

HOOVER GUIDE

... Generates over 6000 gigawatts of

electricity, all passing through this

control room. This way.

BUTT-HEAD

This is dumb, let's find that chick.

BEAVIS

Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.

BEAVIS (CONT.)

Check it out Butt-Head, TV!

BUTT-HEAD

Cool! Huh huh huh.

FLEMMING

Talk ta me, Bork.

BORK

Chief, we found a witness that says he saw

two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly

before we arrived.

FLEMMING

Did you give him a full cavity search?

BORK

(confused)

Ah, the witness?

FLEMMING

Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.

BORK

Well sir, I didn't really think it was

necessary. You see we have a picture of

them from the elevator security cam. Here,

have a look.

BORK (CONT.)

They look like a couple of kids chief.

FLEMMING

Bork, don't you realize what kids today

are capable of? Don't you read the papers?

BUTT-HEAD

Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?

BEAVIS

My butt's bothering me!

BUTT-HEAD

You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh

huh.

BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)

Dammit, all they have is shows about

water.

BEAVIS

That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows

about fire! Change the channel.

BUTT-HEAD

Uh...

BEAVIS

Yeah, turn it up! Louder! Heh heh.

BUTT-HEAD

(reads sign)

Uh... Mas... Ter... Huh huh. Masturbation,

huh huh.

BUTT-HEAD

Uh...

BEAVIS

Yeah, fire! Fire! FIRE!!!

FLEMMING

The hell's going on?

SURGEON

Whoooooops.

TOM

I'll tell ya, it doesn't get any better

than this. This here is God's country.

Unspoiled and...

TOM (CONT.)

Aaaaghhh!!!...

BUTT-HEAD

That was boring. Huh huh.

BEAVIS

Yeah, it's just the same thing over and

over again.

BUTT-HEAD

Uh... We can't leave Washington 'till we

find that chick.

MARTHA

Oh, we're a long ways from Washington Bob.

This is the Hoover Dam.

BEAVIS

Damn! Heh heh hmm heh.

CONCIERGE

I swear, that's all I know! They got on

that tour bus. It was probably heading

west. Please...

MUDDY

I'm gonna kill 'em!

DALLAS

You boys better show up.

FLEMMING

You see what I see, Bork?

BORK

I see it. I don't get it.

FLEMMING

You got half the state looking for ya -

how do you get away?

BORK

(realizes)

Cut the power!

FLEMMING

Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real

pros here. My opinion, terrorists...

What's the scoop on that stolen unit?

BORK

Well, sir it's not good. (to an assistant)

Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new

top-secret biological weapon, a manmade

virus...

BORK (CONT.)

The deadliest known to man. It could wipe

out five states in five days. It can be

activated by simply entering the right

code. Here's what happened when it was

tested on a group of Army recruits...

FLEMMING

Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to

fall into the wrong hands...

BORK

It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished.

It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard

enough, it could break open, releasing the

virus.

FLEMMING

Okay People, as of right now these are the

most dangerous men in America. I want

these faces in front of every Fed and two-

bit sheriff within a thousand miles. The

orders are dead or alive. Let's just pray

that nothing hits that unit.

BEAVIS

Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I

wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.

BEAVIS

Ow! I'll kick your butt!

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh. You mean like this?

DRIVER

Okay, people, next stop, Grand Canyon.

B&B

Huh huh huh huh huh.

BEAVIS

The poop's coming out of the ass of the

ass. Heh heh heh.

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh. It's coming out of the ass, but

it's also coming out of the ass of the

ass.

B&B

Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

RANGER

(a la Carl Sagan)

There are over two hundred active geysers

in Yellowstone Park alone. Old Faithful

here is one of the largest. During an

eruption the water can reach as high as

two hundred feet!...

BUTT-HEAD

So?

RANGER

(ignoring Butt-Head)

TOURIST MAN

BUTT-HEAD

Cool. Huh huh huh.

FLEMMING

Didn't see which way they went. Didn't see

their vehicle. I don't suppose you tried

to stop them?

OLD RANGER

The most dangerous guys in America? Not

FLEMMING

National security is the responsibility of

every American. Bork...

BORK

Cavity search...?

FLEMMING

Deep and hard.

FLEMMING (CONT.)

They're not gonna get away this time. I

want roadblocks. Every road outta here for

two hundred miles.

BEAVIS

AGENT

You saw these two?

ANDERSON

I sure did. They were whackin' off in my

tool shed. Then whackin' off in my camper.

I never seen so much whackin' off.

AGENT

Blue Den this is post nine! I have

positive ID!! (to Tom) Sir, I'm gonna have

the vehicle.

ANDERSON

Well you see, me and the missus are on our

way to Washington. We got this schedule...

AGENT

TOM

(furious)

Now wait right there. You're dealing with

a veteran of two foreign wars. They're the

broken in there, you and I are gonna

FLEMMING

(appalled)

Masturbating in a man's camper! We're

dealing with two sick individuals. I want

that camper torn apart, full cavity

searches all around.

BORK

Chief - just came in! Two days ago,

Express Airways had a disturbance by

someone calling himself - Cornholio. Guess

who matches the description?

FLEMMING

Finally, a real break. Get me that

flight's point of origin. We're gonna kick

some ass.

DUMB GUY

(to B&B)

Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?

BUTT-HEAD

(dehydrated)

Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.

VAN DRIESSEN

She flies so gracefully,

over rocks, trees and sand. Soaring over

cliffs and gently

floating down to land.

She proudly lifts her voice

to sound her mating call.

And soon her mate responds

by singing... "Caw, Caw, Caw."

Come with me, Lesbian Seagull.

Settle down and rest with me...

McVICKER

Uh...uh...uh that's him. He's their

teacher.

VAN DRIESSEN

What's going on here?

FLEMMING

I'll ask the questions. Are these your

students?

VAN DRIESSEN

I assume you're a government agent. I

would think you would know there's

something in this country called due

process.

FLEMMING

That's about the kind of talk I'd expect

from the guy who taught these two. Take

this scum away.

VAN DRIESSEN

I believe I'm supposed to be read my

Miranda Rights...

McVICKER

I...I...I always knew they were no good.

I... I... I hate them!

FLEMMING

(to McVicker)

You've been harboring two criminal

masterminds!

BORK

Chief, you know that guy whose camper they

were whacking off in?

FLEMMING

(appalled)

Bork! You are a federal agent. You

represent the United States Government...

Never end a sentence with a preposition.

Try again.

BORK

Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose

camper they... I mean that guy off in

whose camper they were whacking?

FLEMMING

That's better. Yes?

BORK

We've run a sample through the National

Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two

possible genetic matches for a father.

(holds up photos)

BORK (O.S./CONT.)

Former Motley Crue members turned

drifters.

BUTT-HEAD

You were a roadie for Motley Crue?

DUMB GUY

Yup. Huh huh.

DUMB GUY

Here's another true story. About fifteen

years ago, we stopped in this, uh, toilet,

called Highland...

BUTT-HEAD

Really? That's where we're from.

DUMB GUY

Well, then you know what I'm talking

about. Anyway, here's the story. I

MUDDY

No, I can't say I've seen 'em. I sure hope

it's safe to drive around here.

COP

Don't worry, sir. Just stick to the main

roads. If they're around, they're probably

hiding out in the desert.

MUDDY

That's good to know, Officer.

BEAVIS

Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my

life is like, flashing in front of my

it, but police have not ruled out the

possibility of terrorists.

FLEMMING

Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.

foreigner at that conference. (rises and

puts his fist down) Well, it's not gonna

Oh I don't huh? How about lewd conduct?

Maybe indecent exposure?...

Here's what's gonna happen. One of you's

gonna make a deal and get me the unit. The

other can spend the next sixty years in

jail.

MUDDY

There you're wrong, boy. Me and mah wife

are back together and you'll never...

DALLAS

He stole the unit. Said he put it in some

kid's pants.

MUDDY

Why you damn little...

MARTHA

Now Travis, it doesn't do a body good to

get all worked up. Here. This should help

you relax.

MARTHA

lives today than you'll ever know. You led

us to one of the sickest criminals in our

history. This country owes you a debt.

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, does that mean, like, we're gonna get

money and stuff?

BEAVIS

Yeah, and chicks! We were supposed to

score.

FLEMMING

For security reasons, your actions will

have to remain top secret. But someone

very special wants to give his thanks.

PRESIDENT

Beavis and Butt-Head. On behalf of all

your fellow Americans, I extend my deepest

thanks. You exemplify a fine new crop of

young Americans who will grow into the

leaders of this great country.

BUTT-HEAD

Huh huh huh. He said crap. Huh huh.

BEAVIS

Heh heh. This guy's cool.

PRESIDENT

In recognition for your great service, I'm

appointing you honorary agents in the

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

BUTT-HEAD

Whoa, huh huh!!!

BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)

You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get

alcohol, tobacco and guns!

BEAVIS

Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.

BUTT-HEAD

Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.

BEAVIS

Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes

and chicks! We're gonna score!

B&B

Huh huh huh huh huh.

BUTT-HEAD

Uh... bye-bye.

BEAVIS

Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.

BUTT-HEAD

You know what else sucks? We never even

got a TV.

BEAVIS

Heh mmm, hey mmm Butt-Head! Look!

B&B

Yes! Yes! Yes! Huh huh huh.

BEAVIS

Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever

gonna score?

BUTT-HEAD

Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're

too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.

BEAVIS

Shut up, dill-hole.

BUTT-HEAD

Butt-dumpling...

BEAVIS

BUTT-HEAD

Dill-wad...

BEAVIS

BEAVIS

Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...

BEAVIS

You already said that, Butt-Head.

B&B

Huh huh huh...
