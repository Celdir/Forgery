"TOY STORY"

ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)

Alright everyone, this is a stick-

up!  Don't anybody move!  Now empty

that safe!

ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)

Ooh!  Money.  Money.  Money.

(kissing noises)

ANDY (AS BO PEEP)

Stop it!  Stop it, you mean old

potato!

ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)

Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get

run over!

ANDY (AS SHEEP)

Heeeeelp!  BAAAAA!  Heeeelp us!

ANDY (AS BO PEEP)

Oh, no!  Not my sheep!  Somebody do

something!

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

Reach for the sky.

ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)

Oh, no!  Sheriff Woody!!

ANDY (AS WOODY)

I'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart.

ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)

Doooooh!  How'd you know it was me!

ANDY (AS WOODY)

Are you gonna come quietly?

ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)

You can't touch me Sheriff!  I

brought my attack dog with a built-

in force field!

ANDY (AS WOODY)

Well I brought my DINOSAUR, who

eats force field dogs!!

ANDY (AS DINOSAUR)

AAAAR!  ROAR-ROAR-ROAR!

ANDY (AS SLINKY DOG)

YIPE!  YIPE-YIPE-YIPE!

ANDY (AS WOODY)

You're goin' to jail, Bart.

ANDY (AS WOODY)

Say good-bye to the wife and

tatertots.

ANDY

(pulling Woody's string)

You saved the day again, Woody.

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

You're my favorite deputy.

ANDY

C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.

ANDY

(raising his arms)

Score!

ANDY (O.S.)

Wow!  Cool!

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

Whadda ya think?

ANDY (O.S.)

Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!

ANDY

Can we leave this up 'til we move?

MRS. DAVIS

Well, sure, we can leave it up.

ANDY

Yeah!

MRS. DAVIS

Now go get Molly.  Your friends are

going to be here any minute.

ANDY

Okay.

ANDY

It's party time, Woody!

ANDY

Howdy, Little Lady!

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.

ANDY

(picking up Molly)

C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting

heavy!

(to Woody)

See ya later, Woody.

WOODY

(to himself)

Pull my string!  The birthday

party's today?!

WOODY

(to the room)

Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Ages three and up.  It's on my box.

Ages three and up!  I'm not

supposed to be babysitting Princess

Drool.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!

HAMM

I don't get it.

MR. POTATO HEAD

You uncultured swine!

(to someone O.S.)

What are you looking at, ya hockey

puck?!

WOODY

Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?

SARGENT

(saluting)

Sir!  No Sir!

WOODY

Okay, thank you.  At ease.

WOODY

Hey, Slinky?

SLINKY (O.S.)

Right here, Woody!

SLINKY

I'm red this time.

WOODY

No, Slink --

SLINKY

Oh...well alright, you can be red

if you want.

WOODY

Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad

news.

SLINKY

Bad news?!

WOODY

Sh-h-h-h-h!!

WOODY

(whispering)

Just gather everyone up for a staff

meeting and be happy!!

SLINKY

Got it.

WOODY

Be HAPPY!

WOODY

(to the room)

Staff meeting, everybody.

(aside)

Snake, Robot -- podium duty.

WOODY

Hey Etch!  Draw!

WOODY

(pretending to be shot)

Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've

been working on that draw.  Fastest

knobs in the west.

SLINKY

Got a staff meeting, you guys, come

on, let's go!

WOODY

Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey,

who moved my doodle pad way over here?

REX

ROOAAAARR!!!

WOODY

(unaffected)

Oh, how ya doin', Rex?

REX

Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.

WOODY

I was close to being scared that time.

REX

I'm going for fearsome here, but I

just don't feel it.  I think I'm

just coming off as annoying.

WOODY

(choking)

Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.

BO PEEP

I wanted to thank you, Woody, for

saving my flock.

WOODY

(blushing)

Oh, hey - it was nothing.

BO PEEP

Whadda ya say I get someone else to

watch the sheep tonight?

WOODY

(very flustered)

Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...

BO PEEP

Remember, I'm just a couple of

blocks away.

SLINKY

Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up

front.

SLINKY

Hey, Woody!  C'mon!

MIKE

Ahem!

WOODY

(grabbing microphone)

Oh, thanks, Mike.

(to the crowd)

Okay --

WOODY

(to Mike)

Oh, whoa, step back --

WOODY

Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great.

Everybody hear me?  Up on the

shelf, can you hear me?  Great!

Okay, first item today...oh, yeah.

Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

HAMM

Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!

REX

Well I didn't know we were supposed

to have one already.

MR. POTATO HEAD

(waving his arm out

its socket)

Do we have to hold hands?

WOODY

Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a

big joke.  We've only got one week

left before the move.  I don't want

any toys left behind.  A moving

buddy -- if you don't have one, get

one!

(checking the pad)

Alright, next...uh...oh, yes.

Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion

Awareness" meeting was, I think, a

big success and we want to thank Mr.

Spell for putting that on for us.

Thank you, Mr. Spell.

MR. SPELL

You're welcome.

WOODY

Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note

here...

(under his breath)

Andy's birthday party's been moved

to today.

(full voice)

Next we have --

REX

What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's

today?!  His birthday's not 'til

next week!!

HAMM

What's going on down there?  Is Mom

losing her marbles?!

WOODY

Well, obviously she wanted to have

the party before the move.  I'm not

worried.  You shouldn't be worried.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Of course Woody ain't worried!

He's been Andy's favorite since

kindergarten!

SLINKY

Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head!

If Woody says it's all right, then,

well, darnit, it's good enough for

me.  Woody has never steered us

wrong before.

WOODY

C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and

birthday we go through this.

REX

But what if Andy gets another

dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just

don't think I can take that kind of

rejection.

WOODY

Hey, listen, no one's getting

replaced.  This is Andy we're

talking about.

WOODY

(continued)

It doesn't matter how much we're

played with.  What matters is that

we're here for Andy when he needs

us.  That's what we're made for.

Right?

HAMM

Pardon me.  I hate to break up the

staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE!

Birthday guests at three o'clock!

WOODY

Stay calm, everyone!!

WOODY

Uh, meeting adjourned.

HAMM

Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at

all those presents?!

MR. POTATO HEAD

I can't see a thing!

HAMM

Yessir, we're next month's garage

sale fodder for sure.

REX

(panicked)

Any dinosaur-shaped ones?

HAMM

Ah, for crying out loud, they're

all in boxes, you idiot!

REX

They're getting bigger.

SLINKY

Wait!  There's a nice little one

over there!

MR. SPELL

Spell the word "trashcan."

REX

We're doomed!

WOODY

Alright!  Alright!

WOODY

(continued)

If I send out the troops, will you

all calm down?

REX

Yes!  Yes!  We promise!

WOODY

Okay, save your batteries!

HAMM

Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using

the old noodle.

WOODY

Sargent.  Establish a recon post

downstairs.  Code red.  You know

what to do.

SARGENT

Yes SIR!

SARGENT

Alright men, you heard him.  Code

Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red!

Recon plan Charlie.  Execute!

Let's move move move!!

MRS. DAVIS

Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the

living room.  It's almost time for

the presents.

WOODY

And this --

(turning on the baby monitor)

-- is how we find out what is in

those presents.

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the

chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and

Barbeque --

MRS. DAVIS

Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh,

I thought I told him to pick these up.

REX

Shouldn't they be there by now?

What's taking them so long?!

WOODY

Hey, these guys are professionals.

They're the best.  C'mon, they're

not lying down on the job.

WOUNDED SOLDIER

(moans)

Go on without me.  Just go!

SLINKY

A good soldier never leaves a man

behind.

SARGENT (O.S.)

There they are.

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha

Bravo.

WOODY

This is it!  This is it!  Quiet,

quiet, quiet!

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

Come in, Mother Bird.

Alright...Andy's opening the first

present now.

MR. POTATO HEAD

(chanting)

Mrs. Potato Head...Mrs. Potato

Head...Mrs. Potato Head...

(off Rex's look)

Hey, I can dream, can't I?

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

The bow's coming off...he's ripping

the wrapping paper...it's

a...it's...it's a lunchbox!  We've

got a lunchbox, here!

WOODY

A lunchbox?!

MR. POTATO HEAD

A lunchbox...?!

SLINKY

For lunch.  Heh heh heh...

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

Ok, second present...it appears to

be...okay, it's bed sheets.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Who invited THAT kid?!

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. DAVIS

Oh, only one left.

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

Okay, we're on the last present now...

WOODY

Last present!

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

It's a big one...It's a...it's a

boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship --

Battleship, the boardgame!

HAMM

Yeah, alright!!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Hey, watch it!

HAMM

Sorry there, old Spudhead.

SARGENT

(to army men)

Mission accomplished.  Well done,

men.  Pack it up, we're going home.

WOODY

So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to

worry about.

SLINKY

I knew you were right all along,

Woody.  Never doubted you for a

second.

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

Wait a minute.  Oooh, what do we

have here?!

SARGENT

(indicating the baby monitor)

Wait -- turn that thing back on!

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

Come in, Mother Bird, come in,

Mother Bird.

SARGENT (O.S.)

(continued)

Mom has pulled a surprise present

from the closet.  Andy's opening it...

SARGENT

He's really excited about this one.

It's a huge package.  Oh -- get

out -- one of the kids is in the

way, I can't see...

SARGENT (O.S.)

(from monitor)

...it's...it's a --

REX

It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!

REX

Oh, no!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never

know what it is!

HAMM

(sarcastic)

Way to go, Rex.

WOODY

No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em

around!

HAMM

Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!

WOODY

Plus is positive, minus is negative!

Oh, let me!

ANDY

Let's go to my room, guys!

SARGENT

(into the monitor)

RED ALERT!  RED ALERT!  ANDY IS

COMING UPSTAIRS!

WOODY

There.

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat!

Resume your positions NOW!

WOODY

Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to

your places.  Hurry!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear?

Did you see my ear?

REX

Outta my way!  Here I come, here I

come --

FRIEND #1

Hey, look!  His lasers light up.

ANDY

Take that, Zurg!

FRIEND #2

Quick!  Make a space!  This is

where the spaceship lands.

ANDY

-- and you press his back and he

does a karate-chop action!

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

Come on down, guys.  It's time for

games!  We've got prizes!

ANDY

Oh, yeah!

MR. POTATO HEAD

What is it?

BO PEEP

Can you see it?

SLINKY

What the heck is up there?

REX

Woody?  Who's up there with you?

SLINKY

Woody, what are you doing under the

bed?

WOODY

(composing himself)

Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing.

I'm sure Andy was just a little

excited, that's all.  Too much cake

and ice cream, I suppose.  It's

just a mistake.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in

your spot, Woody.

REX

(GASP!)

Have you been replaced?

WOODY

Hey!  What did I tell you earlier?

No one is getting replaced.

WOODY

Now let's all be polite, and give

whatever it is up there a nice, big

"Andy's Room" welcome.

BUZZ

Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

Come in, Star Command.

BUZZ

Star Command - come in.  Do you

read me?

(to himself)

Why don't they answer?!!

BUZZ

(GASP)

My ship!!

BUZZ

Blast!  This'll take weeks to repair!

BUZZ

Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.

Stardate 4072: My ship has run off

course en route to sector 12.  I've

crash landed on a strange planet.

The impact must have awoken me from

hyper-sleep.

BUZZ

(into communicator)

Terrain seems a bit unstable...

BUZZ

(into communicator)

No read-out yet if the air is

breathable... and there seems to be

no sign of intelligent life

anywhere --

WOODY

Hello-o-o...

BUZZ

HO-YAAAHH!!!

WOODY

Aaaaaaah!  Whoa, hey, whoa, did I

frighten you?  Didn't mean to.

Sorry.  Howdy!  My name is Woody

and this is Andy's room.  That's

all I wanted to say, and also,

there has been a bit of a mix-up.

This is my spot, see, the bed here --

BUZZ

(de-activating his

laser beam)

Local law enforcement!  It's about

time you got here.  I'm Buzz

Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe

Protection Unit.  My ship has crash

landed here by mistake.

WOODY

Yes, it is a mistake, because, you

see, the bed, here, is my spot.

BUZZ

I need to repair my turbo boosters.

Do you people still use fossil

fuels, or have you discovered

crystalic fusion?

WOODY

Well, let's see, we've got double

A's --

BUZZ

Watch yourself!!

BUZZ

(continued)

Halt!  Who goes there?!

REX

Don't shoot!  It's okay!  Friends!

BUZZ

(to Woody)

Do you know these life forms?

WOODY

Yes.  They're Andy's toys.

BUZZ

Alright, everyone.  You're clear to

come up.

BUZZ

I am Buzz Lightyear.  I come in peace.

REX

Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!

BUZZ

Why, thank you...

(pulls away)

Now thank you all for your kind

welcome.

REX

Say!  What's that button do?

BUZZ

I'll show you.

BUZZ (SAMPLED VOICE)

Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

SLINKY

Hey, Woody's got something like

that.  His is a pullstring, only

it --

MR. POTATO HEAD

Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

HAMM

Oh yeah, but not like this one.

This is a quality sound system.

Probably all copper wiring, huh?

So, uh, where are you from?

Singapore?  Hong Kong?

BUZZ

Well...no, actually I'm stationed

up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector

4.  As a member of the elite

Universe Protection Unit of the

Space Ranger Corps, I protect the

galaxy from the threat of invasion

from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn

enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.

REX

And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not

actually  from Mattel, I'm actually

from a smaller company that was

purchased in a leveraged buy-out.

Well, I don't really understand the

financials, but...

WOODY

You'd think they've never seen a

new toy before.

BO PEEP

Well sure, look at him.  He's got

more gadgets on him then a Swiss

army knife.

BUZZ

Ah, ah, ah, please be careful!  You

don't want to be in the way when my

laser goes off.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Hey, a laser!  How come you don't

have a laser, Woody?

WOODY

It's not a laser!  It's a little

lightbulb that blinks!

HAMM

What's with him?

MR. POTATO HEAD

Laser-envy.

WOODY

All right, that's enough.  Look,

we're all very impressed with

Andy's new toy --

BUZZ

Toy?

WOODY

T-O-Y.  Toy.

BUZZ

Excuse me, I think the word you're

searching for is Space Ranger.

WOODY

The word I'm searching for I can't

say because there's pre-school toys

present.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?

REX

Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm

curious.  What does a Space Ranger

actually do?

WOODY

He's not a Space Ranger!  He

doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers

or fly --

BUZZ

Excuse me.

HAMM

Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!

WOODY

Oh, what?!...What?!  These are

plastic.  He can't fly!

BUZZ

They are a terillium-carbonic alloy

and I CAN fly.

WOODY

No, you can't.

BUZZ

Yes, I can.

WOODY

You can't!

BUZZ

Can!

WOODY

Can't!  Can't!  Can't!

BUZZ

I tell you, I could fly around this

room with my eyes closed!

WOODY

Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.

BUZZ

All right, then, I will.

(to toys)

Stand back everyone!

BUZZ

To infinity and beyond!!

BUZZ

Can.

REX

Whoa!  Oh, wow!  You flew

magnificently!

BO PEEP

I found my moving buddy!

BUZZ

Why, thank you.  Thank you all.

Thank you.

WOODY

That wasn't flying!  That was

falling with style!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Man, the dolls must really go for

you!

(aside)

Can you teach me that?

SLINKY

Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --

WOODY

Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days,

everything will be just the way it

was.  They'll see... they'll see.

I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

MATCH CUT TO:

ANDY

Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

WOODY

Finally!

WOODY

(looking back into

the toy box)

Hey!  Who's got my hat?

SHARK

Look, I'm Woody.  Howdy, howdy, howdy!

WOODY

(sarcastic)

Ah-hah!  Ah-hah-hah!

(grabs the hat)

Give me that!

BUZZ (O.S.)

Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog.

Let me show you something.  It

looks as though I've been accepted

into your culture.

BUZZ

(continued)

Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his

name on me.

SLINKY & REX

Wow!

REX

With permanent ink, too!

BUZZ

Well, I must get back to repairing

my ship.

BO PEEP (O.S.)

Don't let it get to you, Woody.

WOODY

(nonchalant)

Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what

do you mean?  Who?

BO PEEP

I know Andy's excited about Buzz,

but you know, he'll always have a

special place for you.

MR. POTATO HEAD

(walking past)

Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...

WOODY

Alright!  That's it!

BUZZ

Unidirectional bonding strip.

ROBOT

Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!

WOODY

Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away

from Andy.  He's mine, and no one

is taking him away from me.

BUZZ

What are you talking about?

(to Robot)

Where's that bonding strip?!

WOODY

And another thing.  Stop with this

spaceman thing.  It's getting on my

nerves.

BUZZ

Are you saying you want to lodge a

complaint with Star Command?

WOODY

Oh okay, so you want to do it the

hard way, huh?

BUZZ

Don't even think about it, cowboy!

WOODY

Oh, yeah, tough guy?!

BUZZ

The air isn't toxic.

BUZZ

How dare you open a spaceman's

helmet on an uncharted planet!  My

eyeballs could've been sucked from

their sockets!

WOODY

You actually think you're THE "Buzz

Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I

thought it was an act!

(to the room)

Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL

Buzz Lightyear!

BUZZ

You're mocking me, aren't you?

WOODY

Oh, no, no, no...

(pointing behind Buzz)

Buzz, look!  An alien!

BUZZ

Where?

SID (O.S.)

Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...

WOODY

Uh-oh.

SLINKY

It's Sid!

REX

I thought he was at summer camp!

HAMM

They must have kicked him out early

this year.

REX

Oh, no!  Not Sid!

SID (O.S.)

...Incoming!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Who is it this time?

WOODY

I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?

LENNY (O.S.)

Right here, Woody.

REX

Oh, no.  I can't bear to watch one

of these again!

WOODY

Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.

SID (O.S.)

(plays under the next

5 lines)

Just stay where you are, Corporal!

Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up.

I know you're tired!  I know your

leg is cramping, but you can't move.

Do you hear me?

BUZZ

What's going on?

WOODY

Nothing that concerns you spacemen.

Just us TOYS.

BUZZ

I'd better take a look anyway.

BUZZ

Why is that soldier strapped to an

explosive device?

WOODY

(redirecting Buzz's view)

That's why.  Sid.

BUZZ

Sure is a hairy fellah.

WOODY

No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!

WOODY

THAT is Sid!

BUZZ

You mean that happy child?

MR. POTATO HEAD

That ain't no happy child.

REX

He tortures toys -- just for fun.

BUZZ

Well, then we've got to do something!

BO PEEP

What are you doing?!!  Get down

from there!

BUZZ

I'm going to go teach that boy a

lesson.

WOODY

Yeah, sure.  You go ahead.  Melt

him with your scary laser.

BUZZ

Be careful with that, it's

extremely dangerous.

LENNY

He's lighting it!  He's lighting it!

SID (O.S.)

NO-O-O-O-O!!!  CA-A-A-A-A-ARL!

LENNY

Hit the dirt!

SID (O.S.)

Yes!  He's gone!  He's history!

BUZZ

I could have stopped him.

WOODY

Buzz, I would love to see you try.

(gesturing to Sid's yard)

'Course I'd love to see you as a

crater.

BO PEEP

The sooner we move the better.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANDY

To infinity and beyond!

MRS. DAVIS

Oh, all this packing makes me

hungry.  What would you say to

dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?

ANDY

Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!

MRS. DAVIS

Go wash your hands and I'll get

Molly ready.

ANDY (O.S.)

Can I bring some toys?

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

You can bring ONE toy...

ANDY (O.S.)

Just one?

WOODY

(to himself)

One toy?

WOODY

(whispering)

Will Andy pick me?

WOODY

Don't count on it?!!  Doh-h-h-h!

WOODY

Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!!

Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!

We've got trouble!

BUZZ

Trouble?!

(looking around)

Where?!

WOODY

(pointing to the back

of the desk)

Down there.  Just down there.  A

helpless toy...it's...it's trapped,

Buzz!

BUZZ

Then we've no time to lose!!

BUZZ

I don't see anything!

WOODY

Oh, he's there.  Just, just keep

looking.

BUZZ

What kind of a toy -- ?

TOYS

BUZZ!!!!

WOODY

Buzz!!!

SLINKY

I don't see him in the driveway!  I

think he bounced into Sid's yard.

REX

(GASP)

Buzz!

RC CAR

(electric motor sounds)

Whirrr!!  Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!

REX

Hey everyone!  RC's trying to say

something!

REX

(leaning down close

to RC)

What is it, boy?

RC CAR

(electric motor sounds)

Whirrr!!! Whirrr!  Whirrrrrr!!

MR. POTATO HEAD

He's sayin' that this was no accident.

TOYS

Huh?

BO PEEP

What do you mean?

MR. POTATO HEAD

I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed...

(pointing at Woody)

...by Woody.

TOYS

WHAT?!?

WOODY

Wait a minute.  You -- you don't

think I meant to knock Buzz out the

window, do you Potato Head?

MR. POTATO HEAD

That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you

back-stabbin' murderer!

WOODY

Now, it was an accident!  Guys,

c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me

SLINKY

We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?

REX

(backing away)

Oh, I don't like confrontations.

SARGENT

Where is your honor, dirtbag?!  You

are an absolute disgrace!  You

don't deserve to --

MR. POTATO HEAD

Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on

your playtime, could ya Woody?

Didn't want to face the fact that

Buzz just might be Andy's new

favorite toy, so you got rid of him.

Well, what if Andy starts playin'

with me more, Woody, huh?  You

gonna knock me outta the window, too?

HAMM

I don't think we should give him

the chance.

SARGENT

There he is, men!  Frag him!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Let's string him up by his pull-

string!

HAMM

I got dibs on his hat!

BO PEEP

Would you boys stop it?!

HAMM

Tackle him!

WOODY

No, no, no, no!  Wait!  Wait I can

explain everything --

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

Andy, c'mon!

ANDY (O.S.)

Okay, Mom, be right down.  I've got

to get Buzz.

SARGENT

Retreat!

ANDY

Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

No, I haven't seen him.

MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)

Psssst!

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

Andy!  I'm heading out the door.

ANDY

But Mom, I can't find him!

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

Well, honey, just grab some other

toy!  Now c'mon!

ANDY

Okay...

ANDY

I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I

left him right there.

MRS. DAVIS

Honey, I'm sure he's around.

You'll find him.

SLINKY

It's too short!  We need more monkeys!

REX

(holding up an empty barrel)

There aren't any more!  That's the

whole barrel.

REX

(yelling out window)

Buzz!  The monkeys aren't working!

We're formulating another plan!

Stay calm!

(beat)

Oh, where could he be?

ANDY

Can I help pump the gas?

MRS. DAVIS

Sure!  I'll even let you drive.

ANDY (O.S.)

Yeah?!

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

Yeah -- when you're sixteen.

ANDY (O.S.)

(sarcastic)

Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.

WOODY

Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince

those guys it was an accident?

WOODY

Buzz!

WOODY

Buzz!  You're alive!  This is great!

Oh, I'm saved!  I'm saved!  Andy'll

find you here, he'll take us back

to the room, and then you can tell

everyone that this was all just a

big mistake.  Huh?

WOODY

(weakly)

Right?  Buddy?

BUZZ

I just want you to know that even

though you tried to terminate me,

revenge is not an idea we promote

on my planet.

WOODY

Oh.  Oh, that's good.

BUZZ

(getting in Woody's face)

But we're not on my planet, are we?

WOODY

No.

WOODY

Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of

me?!

WOODY

Owwwww!!!

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

Next stop...

ANDY (O.S.)

Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!

WOODY

(GASP)

Andy?!

WOODY

Doesn't he realize that I'm not

there?

(beat)

I'm LOST!  Oh, I'm a lost toy!

BUZZ

Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.  The

local Sheriff and I seem to be at a

huge refueling station of some

sort --

WOODY

You!

BUZZ

(into wrist communicator)

According to my nava-computer, the --

WOODY

(whispering)

Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!

BUZZ

Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

WOODY

This is the perfect time to panic!

I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're

going to move from their house in

two days and it's all your fault!!

BUZZ

My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me

out of the window in the first

place --

WOODY

Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't

shown up in your stupid little

cardboard spaceship and taken away

everything that was important to

me --

BUZZ

Don't talk to me about importance.

Because of YOU the security of this

entire universe is in jeopardy.

WOODY

(incredulous)

WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!

BUZZ

Right now, poised at the edge of

the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been

secretly building a weapon with the

destructive capacity to annihilate

an entire planet.  I alone have

information that reveals this

weapon's only weakness.

(pointing at Woody)

And you, my friend, are responsible

for delaying my rendez-vous with

Star Command.

WOODY

YOU ARE A TOY!!!  You aren't the

real Buzz Lightyear, you're an

action figure!!  You are a child's

plaything!!!

BUZZ

You are a sad strange little man

and you have my pity.  Farewell.

WOODY

Oh, yeah?  Well, good riddance, ya

looney!

WOODY

(to himself)

Rendez-vous with Star Command.

PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)

Hey, Gas Dude!

ATTENDANT (O.S.)

You talkin' to me?

PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)

Yeah, man, can you help me?  Do you

know where Cutting Blvd. is?

ATTENDANT (O.S.)

Just a moment...

WOODY

(to himself)

Pizza Planet...Andy!

WOODY

Oh, no!  I can't show my face in

that room without Buzz.

WOODY

Buzz!  Buzz, come back!

BUZZ

(continuing to walk away)

Go away.

WOODY

No, Buzz, you've gotta come back.

I found a spaceship!

WOODY

It's a spaceship, Buzz!

PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)

C'mon, man, hurry up.  Um, like the

pizza's are getting cold here.

BUZZ

Now you're sure this spacefreighter

will return to its port of origin

once it jettisons its food supply?

WOODY

Uh-huh.  And when we get there,

we'll be able to find a way to

transport you...home.

BUZZ

Well, then let's climb abroad.

WOODY

No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's

get in the back.  No one will see

us there.

BUZZ

Negative.  There are no restraining

harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll

be much safer in the cockpit.

WOODY

(loud whisper)

Yeah, but, Buzz!  Buzz!

PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)

Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a

right, huh?

ATTENDANT (O.S.)

Yeah.

PIZZA DELIVERER (O.S.)

Okay, thanks for the directions.

WOODY

(loud whisper)

Buzz!

WOODY

It'll be safer in the cockpit than

the cargo bay.  What an idiot!

Ow!  Watch where you're going!

Sorry.

BUZZ

What a space port.  Good work, Woody.

ANDY (O.S.)

Mom, can I play Black Hole?

Please, please, please?!

WOODY

Andy!

MRS. DAVIS

What's Black Hole?

ANDY

Oh, it's so cool...

BUZZ

Now we need to find a ship that's

headed for Sector 12 --

WOODY

Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way!

There's a special ship.  I just saw

it!

BUZZ

You mean it has hyperdrive?

WOODY

Hyper-active hyperdrive, and

astro...uh, turf.

C'mon, c'mon, that's it...

Alright Buzz, get ready...

BUZZ (O.S.)

This is an intergalactic emergency!

I need to commandeer your vessel to

Sector 12!

BUZZ

(continued; to the aliens)

Who's in charge here?

ALIENS

The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!

ALIEN #1

The claw is our master.

ALIEN #2

The claw chooses who will go and

who will stay.

WOODY

(to himself)

This is ludicrous.

SID (O.S.)

(laughter)

WOODY

Oh, no!  Sid!!!

WOODY

Get down!!

BUZZ

(loud whisper)

What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I

WOODY

climb into this --

SID

Yes!

WOODY

Buzz, NO!

SID

against the glass)

Wha -- ?  Hey!!

ALIEN #4

He has been chosen.

WOODY

Hey!  What are you doing?

ALIEN #5

He must go.

WOODY

Stop it, you -- !  Stop it, you

zealots!

ALIENS

He must go!  Do not fight the claw!

Do not anger the claw!  He has been

chosen.

SID

Alright!  Double prizes!

SID

(looking at his two

new toys)

Let's go home and...play.  Ha-ha-ha.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

ALIEN

Will you be quiet?!!

(to both)

You guys don't get it, do you?

Once we go into Sid's house, we

won't be coming out.

SID

Whoa, Scud!  Hey, boy.  Sit!  Good

boy!

SID

Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy.

WOODY

HANNAH (O.S.)

(as Doctor)

Oh, no.  We have a sick patient

here, nurse.  Prepare the O.R., STAT!

HANNAH (O.S.)

Sid, give her back!  Give her back

now!  I'm telling!

SID

(as Doctor)

Patient is...

(straining while

tightening vise)

...pre-e-epped.

SID

(as Doctor)

No one's ever attempted a double

bypass brain transplant before.

SID

(as Doctor)

Now for the tricky part -- pliers!

BUZZ

(whispering to Woody)

I don't believe that man's ever

been to medical school.

SID

(as Nurse)

Doctor, you've done it!

(running to the door)

Hannah?

SID

(continued)

Janie's all better now.

HANNAH

MOM!!  MOM!!

SID

She's lying!  Whatever she says

it's not true!

WOODY

We are gonna die.

(bolting out of the pack)

I'm outta here!

WOODY

Locked!  There's gotta be another

way out of here.

WOODY

Uh...Buzz?  Was that you?

WOODY

Hey!  Hi, there, little fellah!

Come out here.  Do you know a way

out of here?

WOODY

(GASP!!)

WOODY

B-B-B-Buzz!

BUZZ

They're cannibals!

BUZZ

May day!  May day!  Come in, Star

Command!  Send reinforcements!...

(pause)

Star Command, do you copy?

BUZZ

(aiming his arm out

the pack)

I've set my laser from stun to kill.

WOODY

Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if

anyone attacks us we can blink 'em

to death.

REX

Hey, you guys!  I think I've found

him.  Buzz!  Is that you?!

REX

Whiskers!  Will you get out of

here?!  You're interfering with the

search and rescue.

REX

(whispering)

Look!  They're home!

ANDY

Mom, have you seen Woody?

MRS. DAVIS

Where was the last place you left him?

ANDY

(searching the van)

Right here in the van.

MRS. DAVIS

Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're

just not looking hard enough.

ANDY

He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.

BO PEEP

(GASP)

Woody's gone?!

HAMM

Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran

away.

MR. POTATO HEAD

Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was

guilty.

REX

Who would've thought he was capable

of such atrocities?!

BO PEEP

Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.

DISSOLVE TO:

SID (O.S.)

Oh, a survivor.  Where is the rebel

base?  Talk!

Well, we have ways of making you talk.

SID

Where are your rebel friends now?

Heh, heh.

SID'S MOM (O.S.)

Sid!!  Your pop-tarts are ready!

SID

Alright!!

BUZZ

Are you alright?

(whacking him on the back)

I'm proud of you, Sheriff.  A

lesser man would have talked under

such torture.

WOODY

I sure hope this isn't permanent.

BUZZ

(checking his wrist communicator)

Still no word from Star Command.

We're not that far from the

spaceport --

WOODY

The door!  It's open!  We're free!!

BUZZ

Woody, we don't know what's out there!

WOODY

I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!

WOODY

They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do

something!  Quick!

BUZZ

Shield your eyes!

BUZZ

It's not working.  I recharged it

before I left.  It should be good

for hours --

WOODY

Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use

your karate chop action!

WOODY

Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!

BUZZ

Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that?

Stop that!

WOODY

Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!

BUZZ

Woody, stop it!!

WOODY

Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!

WOODY

There's no place like home.

There's no place like home.

There's no place like home...

WOODY

Another stunt like that, cowboy --

Gone!  It's all go-o-one!  All of

What happened to you?

BUZZ

One minute you're defending the

suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie

Antoinette and her little sisters.

WOODY

I think you've had enough tea for

today.

Let's get you out of here, Buzz.

Sid Phillips reporting.  Launch of

the shuttle has been delayed due to

adverse weather conditions at the

launch site.  Tomorrow's forecast...

SID

Sunny.  Ha-ha-ha.  Sweet dreams.

MRS. DAVIS

I looked everywhere, honey, but all

I could find was your hat.

ANDY

(groggy)

But what if we leave them behind?

MRS. DAVIS

Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure

we'll find Woody and Buzz before we

leave tomorrow.

REX (O.S.)

(muffled)

Aaaah!  I need air!

REX

(relieved)

Aa-a-a-a-ah!

(COUGH)

MR. POTATO HEAD

Will you quit moving around?!

REX

I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so

nervous before I travel.

MR. POTATO HEAD

How did I get stuck with YOU as a

moving buddy?

REX

(following Potato Head)

Everyone else was picked.

BO PEEP

Oh, Woody, if only you could see

how much Andy misses you.

WOODY

Ps-s-s-s-t!  Psst!  Hey, Buzz!

WOODY

Hey!  Get over here and see if you

can get this tool box off me.

WOODY

Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I

can't do this without you.  I need

your help.

BUZZ

I can't help.  I can't help anyone.

WOODY

Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can

get me out of here and then I'll

get that rocket off you, and we'll

make a break for Andy's house.

BUZZ

Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's

the difference.

WOODY

Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.

You must not be thinking clearly.

BUZZ

No, Woody, for the first time I am

thinking clearly.

(looking at himself)

You were right all along.  I'm not

a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A

stupid little insignificant toy.

WOODY

Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being

a toy is a lot better than being a

Space Ranger.

BUZZ

Yeah, right.

WOODY

No, it is.  Look, over in that

house is a kid who thinks you are

the greatest, and it's not because

you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's

because you're a TOY!  You are HIS

toy.

BUZZ

But why would Andy want me?

WOODY

Why would Andy want you?!  Look at

you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any

other toy would give up his moving

parts just to be you.  You've got

wings, you glow in the dark, you

talk, your helmet does that -- that

whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.

WOODY

(continued; depressed)

As a matter of fact you're too cool.

I mean -- I mean what chance does a

toy like me have against a Buzz

Lightyear action figure?  All I can

do is...

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

There's a snake in my boots!

WOODY

Why would Andy ever want to play

with me, when he's got you?

(pause)

I'm the one that should be strapped

to that rocket.

WOODY

Listen Buzz, forget about me.  You

should get out of here while you can.

WOODY

Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I

thought you were --

BUZZ

Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid

over in that house who needs us.

Now let's get you out of this thing.

WOODY

Yes Sir!

WOODY

(strained)

Come on, Buzz!  We can do it!

BUZZ

Woody!  It's the moving van.

WOODY

We've got to get out of here...NOW.

WOODY

C'mon, Buzz.

WOODY

(loud whisper)

Alright.  Buzz!  Hey!  I'm out!

BUZZ

...almost

(GRUNT)

...there

(GRUNT)

...

WOODY

(nervous laugh)

SID

(in his sleep)

I wanna ride the pony...

BUZZ

Woody!  Woody?!  Are you alright?!

WOODY

(punch-drunk)

No, I'm fine...I'm okay...

SID

Oh, yeah!  Time for lift-off!

SID (O.S.)

TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!

WOODY

Aaah!  Back!  Back!  Down!  Down!

WOODY

(out of breath; to himself)

Okay, what do I do?  Come on Woody,

think!

WOODY

Guys!

WOODY

No, no, no!  Wait!  Wait!  Listen!

Please!  There's a good toy down

there and he's -- he's going to be

blown to bits in a few minutes all

because of me.  I've gotta save him!

(pause)

-- But I need your help.

WOODY

Please.  He's my friend.  He's the

only one I've got.

WOODY

(to Babyface)

Thank you.

(to the others)

Okay.  I think I know what to do.

We're going to have to break a few

rules, but if it works, it'll help

everybody.

SID

(as Astronaut)

Houston to Mission Control.  Come

in, Control.

SID

(continued)

Launch pad is being constructed!

Heh-heh.

WOODY

All right, listen up.  I need Pump

Boy here -- Ducky here.  Legs?

WOODY

(continued; to Legs)

You're with Ducky.

(to the others)

RollerBob and I don't move till we

get the signal.  Clear?

WOODY

Okay, let's move!

WOODY

Wind the frog!

WOODY

Wait for the signal.

WOODY

Go!!

HANNAH (O.S.)

I'll get it!

WOODY

Alright, let's go.

HANNAH

I'm coming!  I'm coming!

HANNAH

(annoyed)

SCUD!!!

HANNAH

Stupid dog.

WOODY

Lean back!

SID (O.S.; AS ASTRONAUT)

Uh, Mission Control...is the

launchpad construction complete? --

(simulated static)

Uh, Roger, rocket is now secured to

guide wire.  We are currently

obtaining the...ignition sticks.

Countdown will commence momentarily.

Stand by --

(simulated static)

WOODY

(to toys in the bush)

Let's go!

SID (O.S.)

Hey, Mom?!  Where are the matches?

Oh, oh, wait, here they are.

Nevermind...

BUZZ

(loud whisper)

Woody?!  Great!  Help me out of

this thing!

WOODY

Shhhhhhh!

BUZZ

What?!

WOODY

(loud whisper)

It's ok.  Everything's under control.

BUZZ

Woody?!  What are you doing?!

SID (AS ASTRONAUT)

Houston, all systems are go.

Requesting permission to launch --

(spotting Woody)

Hey!  How'd you get out here?

SID

Oh, well, you and I can have a

cookout later.  Ha-ha-ha...

SID (AS ASTRONAUT)

Houston, do we have permission to

launch? --

(simulated static)

Uh, Roger, permission granted.  You

are confirmed at T minus 10 seconds...

SID

(continued)

...and counting.  Ten!  Nine!

Eight!  Seven!  Six!  Five!  Four!

Three!  Two!... One!...

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

Reach for the sky!!

SID

Huh?

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

This town ain't big enough for the

two of us!

SID

What?!

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

Somebody's poisoned the water hole...

SID

It's busted.

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

Who are you callin' busted, Buster?!

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

(continued)

That's right.  I'm talking to YOU,

Sid Phillips.  We don't like being

blown up, Sid, or smashed, or

ripped apart...

SID

W-w-w-we?

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

That's right.

(beat)

Your toys.

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

From now on, you must take good

care of your toys.  Because if you

don't, we'll find out, Sid.  We

toys can see...

WOODY (VOICE BOX)

(continued)

...everything.

WOODY

(regular voice)

So play nice.

SID

AAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!

SID

The toys!  The toys are alive!

SID

(continued)

N-N-Nice dolly...

HAMM

What's wrong, Sid?!  Don't you want

to play with Sally?!

WOODY

Nice work, fellahs.  Good job.

Comin' out of the ground -- what a

touch!  That was a stroke of genius.

BUZZ

Woody!

BUZZ

Thanks.

MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)

Everybody say, "Bye, house."

ANDY (O.S.)

(depressed)

Bye, house.

BUZZ

Woody!  The van!

WOODY

(to mutant toys)

We gotta run!  Thanks, guys.

WOODY

Quick!

BUZZ

Just go!  I'll catch up!

BUZZ

Come on!

BUZZ

You can do it, Woody.

WOODY

Whew, I made it!

WOODY

(kicking Scud with

other foot)

Aaaaaahh!!  Get away, you stupid

dog!  Down!  Down!

BUZZ

Hold on, Woody!

WOODY

I can't do it!  Take care of Andy

for me!

BUZZ

NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!

WOODY

Buzz!

TOYS

What?!

REX

Are we there already?

SLINKY

Woody?!  How'd you --

WOODY

Ah-hah!  There you are!!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Hey!  What's he doing?

REX

He's at it again!

MR. POTATO HEAD

(pointing at Woody)

Get him!!!

WOODY

Ah-h!!  Ah-h!  No, no!

WOODY

No, no, no!  Wait!

(as Rocky spins him)

Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!

BUZZ

(spinning)

Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...!

HAMM

Pig pile!!

WOODY

No wait!  You don't understand!

Buzz is out there!  We've gotta

help him!!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Toss 'im overboard!

WOODY

No, no, no, wait!

MR. POTATO HEAD

So long Woody!

BUZZ

Who-o-o-oa!  Woody!

WOODY

Well, thanks for the ride.

BUZZ

(pointing ahead)

Look out!!

WOODY

Now let's catch up to that truck!

LENNY

Guys!  Guys!  Woody's riding RC!

And Buzz is with him!

TOYS

What?!!!

BO PEEP

It is Buzz!  Woody was telling the

truth!

SLINKY

What have we done?!

REX

Great.  Now I have guilt.

WOODY

We're almost there.

BO PEEP

Rocky!  The ramp!

BUZZ

Look out!!

SLINKY

(to other toys)

Quick!  Hold on to my tail!

MR. POTATO HEAD

That a boy, Slink!!

SLINKY

Woody!!

SLINKY

Woody!  Speed up!

WOODY

(to Buzz)

Speed up!

BUZZ

The batteries!  They're running out!

SLINKY

Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!

SLINKY

I can't hold on much longer!

WOODY

Slink!  Hang on!

WOODY

(sarcastic)

Great!

BUZZ

Woody!  The rocket!

WOODY

The match!

WOODY

(continued)

Yes!  Thank you, Sid!

WOODY

No-o-o!  No-no-no-no!  No-o-o!

BUZZ

Woody?!  What are you doing?

WOODY

Hold still, Buzz!

WOODY

Ha-ha!!

BUZZ

You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.

WOODY

Wait a minute...I just lit a rocket.

Rockets explo --

SLINKY

I shoulda held on longer.

LENNY

Look!  Look!  It's Woody and Buzz!

Comin' up fast!

REX

Take cover!!

WOODY

Ahhh!! This is the part where we

blow up!

BUZZ

Not today!

WOODY

(covering his eyes)

Ah-h-h-h-h!!

WOODY

Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!

BUZZ

This isn't flying.  This is

falling -- with style!

WOODY

Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!

WOODY

Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!

BUZZ

We're not aiming for the truck!

ANDY

Hey!  Wow!

MRS. DAVIS

What?  What is it?

ANDY

(picking up the toys)

Woody!  Buzz!

MRS. DAVIS

Oh, great, you found them.  Where

were they?

ANDY

Here!  In the car!

MRS. DAVIS

See?  Now, what did I tell you?

Right where you left them.

DISSOLVE TO:

ANDY

Which one can I open first?

MRS. DAVIS

Let's let Molly open one.

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over the monitor)

Frankincense, this is Myrrh.  Come

in, Frankincense.

HAMM

(to the room)

Hey, heads up everybody!  It's

showtime.

REX

Oh!  It's time!

WOODY

Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!

(rubbing his neck)

There's gotta be a less painful way

to get my attention.

BO PEEP

Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

WOODY

Say, isn't that mistletoe?

BO PEEP

Mm-hmmmmm.

REX

(to Slinky)

Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur,

like a leaf-eater.  That way, I

could play the, uh, dominant

predator.  Ha ha ha!

BUZZ

Quiet everyone, quiet!

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

Molly's first present i-i-is...Mrs.

Potato Head.  Repeat.  A Mrs.

Potato Head.

HAMM

Way to go, Idaho!

MR. POTATO HEAD

Gee, I better shave.

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

Come in, Frankincense.  Andy is now

opening his first present --

(STATIC)

WOODY

Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not

worried, are you?

SARGENT (O.S.)

(over monitor)

I can't quite make out --

(STATIC)

BUZZ

(defensively)

Me?  No, no, no, no...

(beat)

Are you?

WOODY

(laughing)

Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly

get that is worse than you?!

ANDY (O.S.)

Oh, what is it?  What is it?

ANDY (O.S.)

Wow!  A puppy!

FADE OUT.
