MY MOTHER DREAMS THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES IN NEW YOR

"MY MOTHER DREAMS

THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES IN NEW YORK"

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MISCHA

(brusquely)

Where to?

MARIAN

Are you sure you got my bag in?

MISCHA

What do you think?  I left it on the

curb?

MARIAN

I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my

first time in New York.  Just a minute.

MARIAN

I want to go to 526 East 5TH.  That's in

the East Village.  My daughter said it

would cost thirty dollars.

CUT TO:

MARIAN

I came to New York to visit my youngest

daughter.

MISCHA

And where is she?

MARIAN

She would have come to the airport to

meet me - she wanted to - but ... but,

she just started a new job and, well, I

guess no one drives here.

MISCHA

So, you come here all by yourself?

MARIAN

Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently

...

MISCHA

... Oh ...

MARIAN

... And the children thought I should

take a trip.

MISCHA

Yeah.

MARIAN

I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you

from?

MISCHA

Moscow.

MARIAN

Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?

MISCHA

Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.

MARIAN

(disconcerted)

You mean it's dangerous?

MISCHA

Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.

(beat)

Not during the day.

CUT TO:

MARIAN

Pardon me, Mischa.  Is this 526 East 5TH

Street?

MISCHA

No, no.  Sorry, I can't drive you to

door.  There's a roadblock on Avenue B

...

(he gestures down the street)

right there ...

MISCHA

This is one-way street.  You go down the

block to the middle.

MARIAN

(pointing uncertainly)

This way?

MISCHA

Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.

(beat)

It's still day.

MARIAN

I see.  How much?

MISCHA

Forty-five all total.

MARIAN

Forty-five?  I thought it was only

supposed to be thirty?

MISCHA

Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip

... it all adds up.

MISCHA

Hey, lady.

(Marian turns)

Hold purse like this.

MISCHA

(nodding approval)

Good luck.

MY MOTHER DREAMS THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES IN NEW YORK

CUT TO:

SQUATTER #1

Hey, lady, can you help us out with some

change today?

SQUATTER #2

Come on.  Every little bit helps.  A

little food, you know?

MARIAN

Maybe some other time.

SQUATTER #1

Thanks a lot anyway.

WOMAN IN A RAGE

You forgot your fucking plant, you

fucking asshole!

WOMAN IN A RAGE

And there's a lot of other shit in there

you forgot.  Just wait there, I'm going

to go fucking get it for you, all right?

No, just wait there! Do you want me to go

get it for you?  Well, why don't I just

do that, huh?  I'm going to do that right

now!

PAULA

Mom!  Hi!  I'll be right down.

PAULA

So, what do you think?

MARIAN

Well, once you're inside, it's nice.

PAULA

You don't like where I live?

MARIAN

Well, when I walked up the block, I ...

well, my word!

PAULA

That's New York.  It looks rundown, but

it's safe during the day.  You'll get

used to it.

CUT TO:

PAULA

You take the M-15 bus all the way to ...

79TH Street.  And then you take the

crosstown bus to 5TH Avenue, and the

Metropolitan Museum of Art is right

there.  You can't miss it.

MARIAN

I wanted to ask you something.  Those

motorcycles across the street ...?

PAULA

Uh-huh?

MARIAN

... What are they all doing there?

PAULA

That's the Satan's Disciples' New York

headquarters.

MARIAN

(alarmed)

The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal

drugs and rape young girls?

PAULA

I've never had any problem with them.

People say it's the safest block in the

East Village.

(lays a reassuring hand on her

mother's arm)

I just hope their motorcycles don't keep

you up at night.

CUT TO:

RANDOM VOICES (O.S.)

Did that shipment of heroin come in?

That old lady see them?

We can kill her if we have to.

BIKER

Oh, Marian ...

SLAM CUT TO:

FADE TO:

CUT TO:

PAULA

(mildly rebuking)

You didn't leave the house all day?

CUT TO:

MARIAN

Would you look at those strawberries.

They made the best jam.

(passes Paula the photos)

Here are some more pictures of the farm.

Crops were unbelievable this year.

MARIAN

Plenty of rain.  Your dad would have been

happy with that.

MARIAN

I just can't seem to focus on anything

these days.

PAULA

(turning to her mother)

That's why it's good you came to visit

me.

MARIAN

(washing her pill down with

some wine)

How are you doing sweetheart?

PAULA

I'm good.

MARIAN

Dating anyone?

PAULA

No, I'm working too much, I don't have

time.

MARIAN

What about the fellow in those pictures?

PAULA

What pictures?

MARIAN

You know ...

(raises both hands in the air)

... whoops!

PAULA

(blushing)

Mother!

MARIAN

Well, they were right out in plain view.

PAULA

Behind the books.

MARIAN

But I was dusting.

PAULA

(reluctantly explaining)

I was seeing Aaron and there were some

... complications.

MARIAN

He seemed quite taken with you.

PAULA

I don't want to talk about it.

MARIAN

(hurt)

You know, you never tell me anything.

PAULA

That's not true.

(lays a placating hand on her

mother's arm)

Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I

want you to see New York.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MARIAN

Excuse me.  Could you please turn your

motorcycles off?  They're so loud, I

can't sleep.

DISSOLVE TO:

SLAM CUT TO:

FADE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

You're just chilling, huh?  Not on this

block, do you understand?

MARIAN

Oh, no.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

What's this, huh?

KID

I ain't got shit on me.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

What is that?   You're chilling, man?

Well, then maybe we need to warm things

up for you, man.  How many times do we

got to tell you?  You don't listen and

you don't learn and that's the problem.

That is the problem.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Hello?

MARIAN

My daughter lives here and I'm her mother

and I've lost my keys.

MARIAN

Hello?  Hello?

DISCIPLE

Roast him!

KID

(screaming)

All right all right all right.

MARIAN

(quavery voice)

Yes, is Paula there? ... Could you leave

her a message, please?  Tell her it's

urgent.

(gathers herself)

Her mother has lost her keys and is

stranded on the street with the Satan's

Disciples ... When she comes back, would

you tell her to come home as quickly as

she can? ... Thank you.

MARIAN

Oh, please, don't hurt me.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

I just need to use the phone, lady.

MARIAN

Oh, let me get out of your way then.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

What happened?  Did you lose your keys?

MARIAN

(withdrawing anxiously)

Have a nice day.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Hello.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

Washing machine repairman.

CUT TO:

PAULA

Maybe you should lay low tomorrow.  I'm

going to see if I can get off early and

maybe we can take the ferry cruise.

Okay?

PAULA

(to herself)

Three left.

PAULA

(softer)

Okay?  Does that sound like a plan?

FADE TO:

MARIAN

Who is it?

MARIKA

It's Marika.  Is Paula there?

MARIAN

She's at work.  I'm her mother.

MARIKA

Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.

MARIKA

I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.

MARIAN

Oh.  You need a cappuccino.

MARIKA

And there was this number on my phone

bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made

at three and four in the morning.  So, I

called the number ... and a woman

answered.  And I ... I hung up.

(leans forward)

So, then I followed him.  Just like in

the movies.  And I found out that he has

a wife and a little girl living in

Brooklyn.  We had been going together for

almost a year.

MARIAN

(shaking her head in disgust)

Men ... they're all the same.

(beat)

Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with

his wife's sister.

MARIKA

(brightening)

Really?

MARIAN

Oh, it was such a big scandal.

MARIKA

What happened?

MARIAN

Poor man had to leave town.

(Marika laughs)

And I hear that other women came forward.

MARIAN

You know, you ought to come out to South

Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve.

He's single.

MARIKA

What does he do?

MARIAN

He's an organic farmer.

MARIKA

(chuckling)

Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.

(smiles warmly)

Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a

very reassuring voice.

MARIKA

I wish they wouldn't come and go in

packs, then they wouldn't be so loud.

MARIAN

I wonder what they do in there?  Don't

they frighten you?  They all look so ...

MARIKA

... Manly?

MARIKA

You know, probably none of them had a

mother like you.

CUT TO:

MARIAN

Excuse me, sir.

(the Disciple Prospect looks

up, poker-faced)

I just wanted to thank you for helping me

get into my building yesterday.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.

MARIAN

My daughter lives across the street from

you people and she tells me that you keep

this area safe.  Is that true?

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

We like to think so, yeah.

MARIAN

And you don't deal drugs?

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

Who told you we deal drugs?

MARIAN

I'm just concerned about my daughter.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

You don't have to worry.  She's going to

be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just

like you.

MARIAN

What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor

boy?

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

(mildly annoyed)

That poor boy's a crack dealer from

Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind

on this block.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

Is there something else I can do for you?

MARIAN

Well, I'd love to see inside your club.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

(taken aback)

You want to come inside?

MARIAN

Well, if you're not holding a meeting or

anything.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

Her daughter lives across the street and

she was wondering ...

HEAD DISCIPLE

What?

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

She's curious ...

HEAD DISCIPLE

What the hell ...

(calling out to Marian)

Come on in.

HEAD DISCIPLE

(pointing to the steps leading

up to the door)

You watch your step here.

HEAD DISCIPLE

Hey, guys.  This here is, uh ...

MARIAN

(meekly)

Marian.

HEAD DISCIPLE

(booming voice)

Marian!

A CHORUS OF VOICES

Hi, Marian.

Hey, Marian.

Yo, Marian.

HEAD DISCIPLE

(explaining her visit)

Marian's daughter lives across the street

and she was a little worried about her.

DISCIPLE #1

Swear to God, lady, she's not here.

DISCIPLE #2

Hey, is she cute?

DISCIPLE #3

Does she like motorcycles?

DISCIPLE #4

Can she cook?

MARIAN

You know, this isn't so bad.  It looks

like our kids' rooms when they were

growing up.

MARIAN

Could use some cleaning.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MARIAN

Well, I'd better be going.  It was nice

meeting all of you.

DISCIPLE #1

Thanks, Marian.

CHORUS OF OTHER DISCIPLES

Thanks, Marian.

DISCIPLE #2

The food was outstanding.

HEAD DISCIPLE

You know, if we can do anything for you,

Marian, you just let us know.

MARIAN

(turns, considers for a moment)

Well, there is one thing.

(beat, mildly scolding)

At night, your motorcycles are so darn

loud, I'm not getting much sleep.  Now,

I'm going home in a few days, so ...

could I ask you to keep them quiet?

HEAD DISCIPLE

(mollifying)

Well, we'll, uh, see what we can do,

Marian.

MARIAN

Thank you.

CUT TO:

PAULA

Hello.

MR. PALMER

Come in.

PAULA

Don, this is my mother.

(turns to Marian)

Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.

MARIAN

(enthusiastically)

Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

MR. PALMER

We're very glad to have your daughter

working for us.

MARIAN

(blurting out)

I met the Satan's Disciples today.

MR. PALMER

(chuckling nervously)

Really?

PAULA

Mother, I ...

MARIAN

(waving her daughter off)

My daughter lives right across the street

from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse,

and I was so worried about her ...

so, I went over and introduced myself.

And they were the nicest people.

MR. PALMER

(playing along)

Well, that's a very unusual New York

experience.

MARIAN

I had a wonderful time.

CUT TO:

MARIAN

And they were so friendly those young

men.  Though I do think they should shave

their beards and ... and get some nicer

clothes.

MARIAN

What do you say ... we take a subway

uptown and see a play tonight?

MARIAN

What's wrong?

PAULA

Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine

such a thing, but ... how many of those

pills have you been taking?

MARIAN

(stung, taken aback)

Oh, that has nothing to do with it.

PAULA

No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing

you too hard to do things on your own.

PAULA

The, um, other night, I got up to get a

glass of water and you were standing by

the window talking to daddy.  I called

out to you, but you didn't answer.  You

remember?

PAULA

New York is a ... it's a strange place in

the summertime.  The noise, the warm air,

it's ... easy to imagine things.

PAULA

Now, you know you didn't go into the

clubhouse, did you?

PAULA (CONT'D)

It's okay.  Dad's dying put a lot of

stress on you.  But you're going to be

all right.  We're all going to be all

right.  Where did you get this vivid

imagination, huh?

FADE OUT.

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

Yo, man!

PAULA

Mom, I need to talk to you.

MARIAN

(still drowsy)

If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't

want to talk about it.

PAULA

No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you

think I'll ever meet anyone like him?

MARIAN

Oh, I hope so, dear.

PAULA

You know that guy in the pictures you

saw?

MARIAN

Aaron?

PAULA

Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.

MARIAN

I'm sorry.

PAULA

It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?

MARIAN

Mm hmm.

FADE TO:

PAULA

I think you should consider coming out

and staying with me longer.

MARIAN

Oh, I don't want to be in the way.

You've got your career and everything.

PAULA

You wouldn't be in the way.  I like

having you around.

MARIAN

Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to

Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your

father, God bless him, wasn't much for

traveling.

PAULA

I'd love to.

CUT TO:

PAULA

Here you go.

(Marian accepts the gift)

I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when

you get back about how much Valium he's

prescribing.  Okay?

MARIAN

At my age, I'm going to take any pill

that makes me feel better.

PAULA

Mother!

MARIAN

I can make my own decisions.

PAULA

I love you, Mom.

(turns to leave)

I have to run.  You remembered to call

the limousine service, right?

MARIAN

Mm hmm.

PAULA

(pulling on her backpack)

Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and

... Paris in the spring!

MARIAN

(pensive)

Goodbye, sweetheart.

CUT TO:

DISCIPLE PROSPECT

All right?
