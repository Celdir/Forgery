YOUTH IN REVOLT

NICK (V.O.)

My name... is Nick.

NICK (V.O.)

My last name, which I loath, is

Twisp.

NICK (V.O.)

The next thing you should know

about me is that I am obsessed with

sex.

NICK (V.O.)

Lately, I have become morbidly

aware of my penis.

NICK (V.O.)

Once a remote region accessed

indifferently for micturition, it

has developed overnight into a

gaudy Las Vegas of the body.

2.

NICK (V.O.)

I am entering the tenth grade at

St. Vitus Academy, which, I am

told, is the most rigorous prep

school in the East Bay. Hopefully I

will be invited to join Miss

Satron's English Literature class.

NICK (V.O.)

I am a voracious reader and listen

to Frank Sinatra. So needless to

say, I am still a virgin.

NICK (V.O.)

I have yet to hold hands with a

girl, let alone have my winkie up

her wendell.

NICK (V.O.)

I am an only child except for my

big sister Joanie, who has left the

bosom of her family to sling hash

at 35,000 feet.

3.

NICK (V.O.)

Mom gives driver's tests at the

Department of Motor Vehicles.

NICK (V.O.)

She used to keep Dad up to date on

all the motor statutes he was

violating. This is one of the

reasons they got divorced.

NICK (V.O.)

Mom's boyfriend, Jerry is a long

distance trucker, though his

ultimate ambition is to be on state

disability.

NICK (V.O.)

I've been struggling to think of a

commendable thing to say about

Jerry.

NICK (V.O.)

No luck. His grey matter registers

at cretin and the needle doesn't

budge.

NICK (V.O.)

Dad is a copywriter for

agricultural magazines.

NICK (V.O.)

He'd like to own a more prestigious

model of BMW, but, as he often

reminds me, he is burdened with

crippling child support payments.

4.

NICK (V.O.)

Lacey is Dad's latest bimbette. She

is twenty and a recently minted

alumna of Stanfort.

CUT TO:

NICK (V.O.)

My mother is the one who painted my

room to look like Dolly Parton's

boudoir. She read this color was

used in hospitals to calm mental

patients.

NICK (V.O.)

I'll tell you what I told her. I am

not mentally ill.

NICK (V.O.)

I'm just a teenager.

5.

YOUTH IN REVOLT

ESTELLE

Jerry? Where did that car come

from?

JERRY

It's a '62 Lincoln convertible.

Like the one Kennedy was shot in.

NICK

Except his was black and yours is

white. And dirty.

JERRY

See that. I was going to take you

and your mom for a spin after

breakfast. But now I guess it'll

just be her and me. You have your

smart mouth to thank for that.

NICK

Damn it. I guess I'll just have to

hang out all alone at the book

depository.

JERRY

The what?

ESTELLE

Jerry, I don't understand. What

happened to the Chevy-Nova?

JERRY

Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda

Naval Air Base. A man should never

own a car for more than three

months, Estelle. That way he always

gets the thrill of owning a new

automobile!

6.

NICK (V.O.)

After spending twelve years with

Dad, Mom has had a string of

lovers, none of whom she has asked

me to approve.

NICK (V.O.)

I'm starting to think her

boyfriends are like U.S.

Presidents.

NICK (V.O.)

Just when you think they can't get

any worse...

NICK (V.O.)

...she manages to find God's

Perfect Asshole.

7.

SAILOR #1

Is Jerry here?

NICK

He just left. What's up?

SAILOR #1

What's up is that hunk of shit

Chevy he sold us made it seventeen

miles before the engine blew up.

SAILOR #2

And we found evidence of a banana

in the transmission.

SAILOR #1

So he owes us nine hundred dollars.

NICK

Well, I think he used that nine

hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln.

He's giving my mom a joyride in it

now. But he'll be back this

afternoon, so I would come back

then. He's pretty stubborn. You

might have to beat it out of him.

SAILOR #1

That can be arranged. In the

meantime we're leaving the piece of

shit in the driveway. With a note.

NICK

I like it. Very to the point.

Well... See you guys this

afternoon!

8.

LEFTY (V.O.)

I might have to kill myself.

NICK (V.O.)

I hope you have a good reason.

LEFTY

My sister said she saw Millie

Filbert holding hands with some

college guy.

NICK

I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister

is just waging psychological

warfare.

LEFTY

Well it's working. What am I gonna

do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think

about Millie so much my balls ache.

NICK

Maybe your just not wacking off

enough.

LEFTY (O.S.)

So, I've been taping my pecker to

my right leg at night.

NICK (V.O.)

In case you haven't heard, Lefty's

erect member takes a dramatic turn

midway up the shaft.

9.

LEFTY (O.S.)

Then I look at this issue of Better

Homes and Gardens that has a girl

that looks just like Millie until

it gets good and hard. I think it's

starting to straighten out.

NICK

Why don't you just have your

parents take you to the dick

doctor?

LEFTY (O.S.)

Are you kidding? It would kill them

to know that I even get hard-ons.

NICK

Still, you might want to get it

fixed before asking Millie out.

LEFTY (O.S.)

True. What if I shove it up the

wrong hole?

NICK (V.O.)

Lefty's grasp of the female anatomy

is somewhat tenuous; he imagines

there are orifices galore down

there.

JERRY

Nick, you little shit, get down

here!

ESTELLE

Nick, do you know anything about

this?

NICK

Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by.

They want their money back. I guess

there was a banana in the

transmission.

JERRY

You tell them when I was coming

back?

10.

NICK

Now why would I do that?

ESTELLE

What are you going to do, Jerry?

JERRY

I think I'll go get the Lincoln

washed.

ESTELLE

You're leaving? What happens when

the sailor comes back for his nine-

hundred dollars?

JERRY

Just tell him he bought the car

with my standard guarantee. Thirty

days or thirty feet. Whichever

comes first. I'm in the right.

NICK

Oh, look. The sailors are here.

JERRY

Get rid of them!

NICK

Jerry, where are you going? Just

tell them you are in the right.

11.

SAILOR #1

Sixty-three lousy dollars.

JERRY

That's my life savings!

ESTELLE

Don't hurt him! Nick, call 911!

SAILOR #1

Touch that phone, kid, and you lose

your left nut.

JERRY

Please. Please don't hurt me. It's

all I got, guys. I swear. Take the

Lincoln!

SAILOR #1

I don't want the Lincoln. I want my

nine-hundred dollars. I'm taking

the sixty-three, which means you

owe me another eight hundred and

thirty.

NICK

Eight hundred and thirty seven,

actually.

SAILOR #1

Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or

you'll be found in the trunk of

your new used piece of shit at the

bottom of the Bay.

JERRY

Wow, those guys are even dumber

than I thought. They actually think

I'm stupid enough to let them

muscle me into paying.

12.

ESTELLE

Jerry, what are you talking about?

We need to call the police!

JERRY

I'm not some tattle-tale like your

son.

ESTELLE

Then for God's sake, Jerry, just

sell the Lincoln and pay them!

JERRY

Can't. It's in The Code.

ESTELLE

What code? The vehicular code?

JERRY

Code of the streets, Babe. Code of

the streets.

ESTELLE

Then what are you planning to do?

NICK (V.O.)

We are going to Ukiah for a last

minute vacation.

NICK (V.O.)

Jerry says we'll be staying in a

cabin on Clear Lake that's owned by

a friend of his.

ESTELLE

Goodbye, everyone! We're going on

vacation!

JERRY

Let's blow!

13.

NICK (V.O.)

I'm not sure how this is the

solution to his problem. But I've

decided to go along with it, seeing

as I'm not rooting for him anyway.

ESTELLE

Jerry...? You said it was a cabin.

JERRY

C'mon Estelle. It's real cute on

the inside.

JERRY

I say the kid does the dishes and

we retire to the master bedroom.

NICK

Mom? Do you really like Jerry?

14.

ESTELLE

Nick, how   many men do you think

there are   who'd be interested in a

forty-one   year old woman with two

brats, no   money, and stretch marks?

NICK (V.O.)

Mom is a realist about everything.

Except her age. She's forty-three.

MRS. SAUNDERS (O.S.)

It's your neighbor, Mrs. Saunders.

Church services begin at seven

fifteen prompt. Donuts will be

served.

15.

NICK (V.O.)

The moment I see her I know the

Gods, while having cruelly endowed

me with imperfect posture and pussy

postponing pimples, had put me here

for a purpose. My heart palpitates.

My mind races. I get an instant

T.E.

SHEENI

Your robe is open.

SHEENI

Hel-lo, Excitable Boy.

ESTELLE

Nick, honey, meet Sheeni Saunders.

NICK

Hello.

ESTELLE

Sheeni needs to go to the grocery

store. I've offered her your help

in carrying her bags.

16.

NICK

Thanks a pantsful.

NICK

You don't have to go to services?

SHEENI

No. Much to the consternation of my

fanatical parents I have converted

to atheism. Fortunately my brother,

Paul, paved the way for such

transgressions.

NICK

Paul is an atheist too?

SHEENI

Buddhist, I believe, though we have

not seen him in some time. I myself

am looking forward to being free of

parental bondage.

NICK

Likewise.

SHEENI

Well, your mother seems very nice,

though your father I think might be

rather dim.

NICK

Jerry and I share no blood links of

any kind.

NICK

Sounds rather zealous.

SHEENI

Yes, even though I am no longer a

believer I always found the

services wonderfully aerobic.

NICK

You could say the same thing about

sex.

17.

SHEENI

Nick, are you going to turn out

like all the other young men and

have nothing on your mind except

carnal pleasures?

NICK

I hardly ever think about sex.

SHEENI

Really? I think about it all the

time. It's the hormones at work,

you know.

NICK

Wow. A second floor.

SHEENI

Yes. Father bought it so that he

could look down upon the world. For

him, Christian humility has always

been a struggle.

SHEENI

Well, it was nice to meet you,

Nick.

NICK

Sheeni? Do you want to come to the

beach with me?

SHEENI

What a thoughtful invitation. I'd

love to, Nick. Wait for me in the

living room.

SHEENI

Back in a moment.

18.

MR. SAUNDERS (O.S.)

I understand you have invited my

daughter to the beach.

NICK

Er, yes, Mr. Saunders.

MR. SAUNDERS

Aha! Then I trust, sir, you are

aware that in doing so you have

entered into an oral contract to

perform in loco parentis, i.e. to

provide for the safety and well-

being of aforementioned minor

female.

SHEENI (O.S.)

Oh, Father, do shut up.

SHEENI

Let's go, Nick. Bye, Father.

MR. SAUNDERS

Vaya con Dios!

SHEENI

Would you mind applying this to my

exposed areas?

NICK

Not at all.

19.

SHEENI

My, you get turned on easily.

SHEENI

Oh, don't stop, Nick. We all have

our hormones to deal with. Girls

are fortunate in that it doesn't

show. For all the world knows, my

vagina could be moist with desire

as we speak.

NICK

Is it?

SHEENI

That's none of your business, I'm

sure. Shall you do my front too?

NICK

I'm up for it.

SHEENI

I hope you don't find it too

stimulating, Nick.

NICK

I'm coping.

SHEENI

Uh, Nick. Maybe you better do the

top now.

SHEENI

Thanks, Nick.

20.

SHEENI

Breathless is one of my favorite

films, though it might be eclipsed

by Rebel Without a Cause. I often

wonder what American cinema would

be like today had Dean done more

than three.

SHEENI

Oh, Nick. You seem very nice. But

in fairness, I should tell you that

I have a boyfriend.

NICK

What's his name?

SHEENI

Trent Preston.

NICK

What's he like?

SHEENI

Seventeen years of age, six-two,

fluent in French, plays the piano,

a champion swimmer, and writes

Futurist Percussive poetry.

NICK

I'm not familiar with Futurist

Percussive poems.

SHEENI

I could recite one of Trent's if

you'd like.

NICK

Please do.

21.

SHEENI

RamDam 12/ Sizzle mop/ Crunch down/

Safety net/ Hot! Hot! Hot!/ Void.

NICK (V.O.)

If that's poetry, I'm a turkey

scrotum.

NICK (V.O.)

Here is an hour by hour account of

the worst night of my life.

NICK (V.O.)

1 AM. I decide it is just a case of

puppy love and look forward to the

interesting women I shall meet in

the future.

NICK (V.O.)

2 AM. I conclude the only way out

is suicide. I begin to pen a

poignant suicide note. Sheeni will

see Trent for the shallow pedant he

is and always treasure my memory.

JERRY (O.S.)

Turn off the damn light!

NICK (V.O.)

3 AM. I decide I am too chicken for

any of the manly, violent means of

suicide. I shall swallow sleeping

pills. Where to get them, though?

22.

NICK (V.O.)

4 AM. I can not die an inviolate

virgin. Either I find a way to get

laid soon or suicide gets postponed

until after high school.

JERRY (O.S.)

You wanna beat your meat, go

outside!

NICK (V.O.)

5 AM. It will be too painful to see

Sheeni again. I shall ask Mom if we

can cut our vacation short and

return to Oakland.

NICK (V.O.)

6 AM. Violent panic! I have to see

Sheeni again!

NICK

Good morning!

SHEENI

Nick? God what time is it?

NICK

Seven o'clock. How about breakfast?

SHEENI

(smiling with endearment)

Come back in two hours. I'm going

on a hike. You can join me if you'd

like.

23.

SHEENI

Nick, where are your hiking boots,

water bottle, provisions, survey

maps and compass?

NICK

Like John Muir I enter the

wilderness with nothing more than

my journal and a childlike sense of

wonder.

SHEENI

Okay, but I have no plans to baby

any slackers.

NICK

Quite a drop.

SHEENI

Yes. Not to be morbid, but this

sight has been the chosen means of

at least three teen suicides.

NICK

Huh. Quite a hike just to end your

life.

SHEENI

Well, there is a road. But I agree.

Adolescents have a tendency toward

the over-dramatic.

24.

NICK

That's my journal!

SHEENI

Don't get so upset Nick. Though

your handwriting is egregious, you

have a fairly decent vocabulary.

Although, Trent is not an "affected

twit."

NICK

Those are my private thoughts and

are none of your business!

SHEENI

Nick?

NICK

What?

SHEENI

The lengths you say you are willing

to go to to win my heart, the

contemplation of suicide at the

thought of not having me...

(taking a sensual breath)

It all evokes a strong emotional

warmth in my breast.

SHEENI

Did you mean it, Nickie?

NICK

How would you like it if I read

your journal?

SHEENI

You can read it if you'd like.

25.

NICK

It's in French.

SHEENI

A necessity for a child in a

household with prying Christian

parents.

NICK

What does it say?

SHEENI

Wouldn't you like to know. That

last passage would be of particular

interest to you.

NICK

Spill it! I demand full disclosure!

SHEENI

Never!

SHEENI

(softly chanting)

Nickie's got a hard-on.

SHEENI

You're still a virgin, I can tell.

Maybe that's why I like you.

SHEENI

Kiss me, you wienie.

26.

SHEENI

Okay, lover. Break's over. Let's

go!

NICK

When can I see you again?

SHEENI

Get up early tomorrow and you can

shower with me in the ladies room.

Five minutes to six. If you dare.

ESTELLE

So what's this Sheeni girl like?

NICK

She's the Encyclopedia Britannica.

JERRY

She's got a nice rack.

ESTELLE

Jerry!

27.

MRS. SAUNDERS

RAPE! RAAAAAPE!

SHEENI

Get out quick!

NICK

Should I go to the sheriff's now?

SHEENI

No. I managed to convince Mother

you were retarded and couldn't read

the sign.

28.

NICK

Say, where were you anyway?   We

said five minutes to six.

SHEENI

I'm sorry. But, Nick, women are

always discreetly late. It's

expected of us.

NICK

Swell. And the punctual guy fries

in the chair for rape.

SHEENI

Don't complain. At least you got to

shower with a naked woman.

(licking donut powder off

her fingers)

What are your plans today?

NICK

My parents want to go to

Middletown. Jerry has the moronic

notion of buying a trailer there

before we leave.

SHEENI

I should like to come with you,

Nick. The more time we spend

together the better. I fear when

you leave we might never see each

other again.

29.

JERRY

What's your cash price?

GEEZER

I said in the ad. Thousand dollars

firm.

JERRY

Thousand, huh? That must be with a

guarantee.

GEEZER

As is, where she is.

JERRY

I don't know. Those rusty propane

tanks are a fire hazard. The roof

probably needs work. I couldn't go

above eight hundred.

ESTELLE (O.S.)

There are mouse droppings in all

the closets, Jerry.

GEEZER

I might take nine fifty.

JERRY

Nine hundred.

SHEENI

Look, Nick!

NICK

Great.

SHEENI

(to the geezer)

How much?

GEEZER

Ten dollars.

30.

NICK

All I have is a Subway card with

four stickers.

GEEZER

Sold.

NICK

No doubt close to the dog's actual

value.

SHEENI

Oh, thank you, Nickie!

SHEENI

I'm going to name him Albert.

(pronounced Al-bear)

GEEZER

That don't sound like any kind of

name for a dog.

SHEENI

(scowling defensively)

I'll have you know I've named him

after the deceased French writer,

Albert Camus. Author of L'Etranger

and other works of existential

brilliance.

NICK

Sheeni, I think I love you.

SHEENI

Well, your hormones certainly do.

And oddly enough, my hormones like

you too.

31.

NICK

Sheeni? It's... It's okay. We can

visit each other when I get a

drivers license.

SHEENI

I hope that's true, but.. It's not

that. It's...

NICK

What?

SHEENI

It's my parents. They're... I fear

they will never allow me to keep

Albert.

NICK

Oh.

SHEENI

(SNIFFLING)

Nick, honey. Why don't you take

Albert? He could be our love child.

NICK

No way.

SHEENI

At least you could consider it,

honey. For me. I've never asked you

for anything before.

NICK

Maybe I could take him, but I'd

have certain conditions. I would

have to be the only dad on the

scene.

(matter of fact)

Trent would have to go.

SHEENI

That's asking a lot. Trent worships

the ground I walk on.

NICK

It's your choice. Life with me and

the dog you love. Or a pet-free

existence with a shallow,

egotistical poet.

32.

SHEENI

OK, Nick, I guess I don't have any

choice. I'll break up with Trent.

But if he kills himself it's on

your conscience.

NICK

I accept full responsibility.

SHEENI

Well, good, that's settled.

NICK

Not quite, darling. I want one more

thing.

SHEENI

What?

NICK

What do you think?

SHEENI

Do you have a condom?

SHEENI

It has to be in a safe place. A

nice comfortable bed. With no

threat of interruptions. And for

relaxation and mood setting some

good red wine, preferably French. I

want a new condom. Not one that's

been riding around in your wallet

for years. Consumers rated them a

while back. I suggest you get their

top-rated brand. This may take some

research in the library. I'd

appreciate a photocopy of the

article. Plus, for supplementary

protection, I want a name brand

spermicide.

NICK

How about I have a quick vasectomy

just to be on the safe side?

SHEENI

(matter of fact)

Well, Nick, that, of course, is up

to you.

33.

ESTELLE

Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni.

It's time to hit the road.

SHEENI

(whispering in his ear)

Don't forget, darling. Red wine and

Consumer Reports.

JERRY

Okay. Back to civilization!

NICK (V.O.)

I have a tall mountain to climb,

with many treacherous glaciers

still to cross, but finally, I have

obtained a stamped entry visa to

the paradise that lay beyond.

NICK (V.O.)

In short... I have a very real

prospect for getting laid.

FADE TO BLACK.

34.

JERRY

You see that, Babe. They caved.

NICK

I guess they didn't cave after all.

JERRY

Boy, everything's complete. There's

even water in the windshield

washer.

ESTELLE

How did they ever get it in here?

My front door can't be more than

three feet wide.

JERRY

Looks like they brought it in piece

by piece and then reassembled it.

ESTELLE

But it would take an army of

mechanics to do all that!

JERRY

Or a navy, Babe. Or a navy.

35.

ESTELLE

Nick, your sister came all the way

from LA for a weekend visit!

NICK

Stellar.

JERRY

Can someone do something about the

mutt?

ESTELLE

I don't know, Jerry. Can someone do

something about the monstrosity

dripping oil in my living room?

JOANIE

Yeah, I noticed that. What's the

story?

NICK

Jerry tried to outsmart a few

sailors. It's been an amusing saga.

JERRY

OK, Babe, I guess when I come back

from my next haul I'll just have to

take it apart piece by piece.

36.

JOANIE

Up to anything scandalous these

days, Nick?

NICK

I was going to ask you the same

thing.

JOANIE

What do you mean?

JOANIE

Not that it's any of your business,

but I've taken a class to improve

my posture.

ESTELLE

I think Joanie looks very nice. And

she has a new boyfriend too.

NICK

Did you meet him in posture class?

ESTELLE

Nick met a nice girl in Ukiah.

JOANIE

Really now? Are you on each others'

Myspace pages?

NICK

Hardly. Sheeni believes the

internet will be the end of

literacy.

JOANIE

So it's to be a torturous snail

mail exchange, huh?

NICK

More like the occassional collect

call.

ESTELLE

Collect calls? And just who do you

expect to pay for that?

37.

JERRY

Hey, Nick. Want to learn how a car

is put together?

NICK

No, thanks. Auto mechanics doesn't

interest me.

JERRY

See, Estelle, I told you the kid

was queer-eeAAAAHHHHH!

JERRY

Damn it! The dog!

ESTELLE

Nick, put the dog in the basement.

ESTELLE

Nick, that was your father on the

phone. He lost his job.

NICK

How unlike him.

ESTELLE

Watch your smart mouth. This means

the end of child support.

NICK

Which means...

ESTELLE

You'll have to start going to...

(DISTORTED)

Oakland Public School.

38.

NICK

Hello?

OPERATOR (V.O.)

Will you accept a collect call from

Sheeni Saunders?

NICK

Absolutely.

SHEENI (V.O.)

Nick?

NICK

Sheeni? How are you?

SHEENI (V.O.)

I'm well, Nickie.

NICK

And how is Trent? Not too suicidal

I hope.

SHEENI

Of course, he was disconsolate, but

we talked all day and he's come to

see this as an opportunity for

growth. Oh, and Nick, Trent wanted

me to tell you that he bears you no

ill will.

NICK

Nor I him. I wish him all the best.

SHEENI

His parents are sending him to a

French speaking boarding school

this year. He's sure to get along

there. So how is my darling Albert?

39.

NICK

Well, though he's taken a disliking

to Jerry.

SHEENI

And you, Nickie? How are you?

NICK

I regret, Love of My Life, my

father has lost his job and I will

now be forced to go to public

school.

SHEENI

How unfortunate. What did he do?

NICK

He's a writer - sort of. He writes

advertising copy.

SHEENI

Really?

(pensive beat)

Nick, I suggest we look at your

father's firing as a blessing in

disguise.

NICK

How so?

SHEENI

I propose we get your father a job

here in Ukiah and you can come and

live with him.

NICK

Brilliant. Not that I'm fond of

Ukiah, but I'd live in a drainage

culvert to be with you.

SHEENI

Oh, Nickie. Now, I happen to know

Progressive Plywood is looking for

an assistant editor. It would be

perfect for your father.

NICK

I had no idea you had knowledge of

the employment opportunities of

trade magazines.

SHEENI

The owner is the father of a friend

of mine.

40.

NICK

Anyone I know?

SHEENI

Okay, it's Trent's father. So what?

NICK

So why would Trent want to help my

father move to Ukiah?

SHEENI

I told you, darling. Trent harbors

you no ill will. I will have him

call your father up pretending to

be a head hunter.

NICK

Very well, but I don't see how I am

to live with him. My mother values

my indentured servitude.

SHEENI

You must influence her to send you

away. I feel this will require

being in a constant state of open

revolt on your part.

NICK

What do you want me to do?

SHEENI

I propose you rent the film Rebel

Without a Cause as soon as

possible. You must emulate James

Dean...

SHEENI

...You must be bad, Nickie. Be

very, very bad.

NICK

I will, darling. I will!

41.

ESTELLE

Kids? This is Officer Lance

Wescott. He has some bad news.

LANCE

Your mother's friend Jerry had a

heart attack in a bar in Dallas.

He's dead.

ESTELLE

Will they be sending his

belongings?

LANCE

Uh... I'm afraid they've already

been sent. To his wife.

ESTELLE

His... His wife?!?

LANCE

There, there, Ma'am. It's going to

be okay.

NICK (V.O.)

I have decided to create a

supplementary persona named

Francois.

42.

NICK (V.O.)

Like a Parisian James Dean, he will

be bold, reckless, contemptuous of

authority, and irresistible to

women.

NICK

Hello, Francois. I think you'll do

nicely.

FRANCOIS

Oui, I am ze perfect match pour une

Francophile for ze likes of Sheeni

Saunders. I have ze calculating

intelligence...

NICK

...the itchy trigger finger...

NICK                            FRANCOIS

NICK

Damn! Those hippos are taking a

shower together. How repulsive!

43.

NICK

Where's Joanie?

ESTELLE

She's sleeping in.

NICK

No doubt. I don't think anyone got

a wink last night with all that

racket.

NICK

I thought there were laws in this

city against illicit cohabitation.

Or are they just another big

policeman's joke?

LANCE

Kid, you are asking for trouble.

NICK

What are you going to do? Shoot me

with your gun?

ESTELLE

No, Lance! Nickie, go to your room.

44.

ESTELLE

Where do you think you're going?

NICK

Out!

ESTELLE

What the in God's name has gotten

into you?!? Jerry paid good money

for that trailer!

NICK

And just what makes you so sure it

was me?

ESTELLE

Who the hell else would write such

a thing?

ESTELLE

And just how do you explain this?

NICK

That's Lacey.

ESTELLE

And just who the hell is Lacey?

NICK

Dad's girlfriend.

45.

ESTELLE

His girlfriend? What are you doing

with a picture like this of your

father's girlfriend?

JOANIE

C'mon, Mom, all boys his age have

pictures like that to...

ESTELLE

When I want your opinion on raising

my child, I'll ask for it.

(to Nick; morbidly

CURIOUS)

And what's this Lacey tart like?

NICK

Well, she likes fast cars and takes

a lot of naps with dad.

NICK

She likes to sit on Dad's lap while

he eats and blow in his ear.

NICK

And she calls him "Thunder Rod" and

he calls her "Sugar Puss."

ESTELLE

You are confined to your room until

school starts, you sick pervert.

NICK

I wish I was leaving with you

tonight.

JOANIE

Your day will come. I never thought

mine would, but it did. Was all

that stuff about Lacey and Dad made

up?

NICK

I wish. Did you really take a

posture class?

46.

JOANIE

Implants. I wanted them all my

life.

NICK

Hey, Lefty.

LEFTY

What's with your mom, Nick? She

gave me the third degree just to

come up here.

NICK

I vandalized Jerry's trailer and

she found my picture of Lacey.

LEFTY

Well, good thing I stole this from

the bookstore then.

LEFTY

I was reading it all last night.

Boy, having sex is a lot more

complicated than I thought. Did you

know you were supposed to stick

your pinkie in her bumhole?

NICK

You lie.

LEFTY

No way, man. Here, I got the page

marked.

NICK

Yeah, but I'm not sure I should try

this on Sheeni. I think this book

is for people who've been married

so long they're disgusted by the

sight of each other.

47.

LEFTY

Are we really supposed to be

that... uh... big?

NICK

I think these illustrations are

disproportionate for emphasis.

LEFTY

Maybe we should compare.

NICK

Perhaps we should. Just for the

sake of research.

ESTELLE

PERVERTS!

ESTELLE

FRIGGIN' GODDAMN PERVERTS!

ESTELLE

You won't get away! I'm calling

your parents! PERVERTS!

ESTELLE

In my house! How dare you!

48.

ESTELLE

Nick, I just want you to know that

I've thought about it, and I've

accepted that you are gay.

NICK

Thanks a pantsful, but I'm not gay.

If you're really concerned though,

I suggest you get me a room at the

Ukiah Motel 6. If anyone can

straighten me out, it's Sheeni.

ESTELLE

That sounds more like a job for

your father. Here, he wants to talk

to you.

NICK

(into phone)

Hello?

GEORGE

So what's this I hear about you

being gay?

49.

NICK

What's this I hear about you being

unemployed?

GEORGE

Yes, but my condition is only

temporary. I can change it.

NICK

I hope you do. We need the money.

GEORGE

Nick, there are more important

things in life than money.

NICK

I know, Dad. Like getting a good

education. And being able to

respect your parents.

GEORGE

I've got two words for you. Safe

sex.

NICK

Thanks, Dad.

50.

FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)

Office of Child Welfare.

NICK

Hello, uh... My name is Nick. Nick

Twisp. My father's name is George

Twisp.

FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)

Has he hit you, Nick?

NICK

Not lately. But he's missed several

child support payments, and is not

looking for work. So now I'm going

to public school in Oakland.

FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)

Not the Oakland schools!

NICK

Yes. And he's had an offer from a

respectable publication in Ukiah.

FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)

Don't you worry, young man. I'll

get right on this. Don't worry.

We'll light a fire under that

deadbeat!

NICK

Hey, Lefty. How's it hangin'?

LEFTY

You'll never believe who called me,

Nick. Millie Filbert!

NICK

What?!? Why?

LEFTY

I dunno. She just called and asked

if I wanted to hang out tonight. I

didn't want to ask why. I need to

find someplace for us to get it on.

51.

NICK

You can use my house if you want.

LEFTY

Really?

NICK

Sure. My Mom and Lance are going to

a movie and I'm planning on

stealing Jerry's trailer and

torching it in a parking lot, so

you'll have the whole house to

yourself.

LEFTY

Right on.

NICK

So where you headed anyway?

LEFTY

Dr. Browerly's office. My parents

are making me see a shrink now.

NICK

He asking lots of weird questions?

LEFTY

You bet your left nut he is! He

asked if I had any lustful thoughts

toward my sister.

NICK

What did you tell him?

LEFTY

I told him about beating off once

with her brassiere.

NICK

What did you tell him that for?

LEFTY

You don't know what it's like. I

think they release chemicals in

their office to make you tell the

truth.

NICK

Sounds like a professional. He must

be very expensive.

LEFTY

I wouldn't know. The bill goes to

your house.

52.

NICK

My mom is paying for your therapy?

LEFTY

I guess so. It was your cyclops I

was staring at.

NICK

Yes, but it was your idea.

LEFTY

That's true. Gee, maybe I am gay.

NICK

Don't be retarded. We were doing

research for our girlfriends.

LEFTY

Oh, right. I forgot. That's a

relief. So you'll leave the door

open?

NICK

Yeah, just don't blow your load on

my sheets.

LEFTY

Thanks a pantsful, Nick.

NICK

Don't mention it. See ya, Lefty.

ESTELLE

Lance and I are walking down to the

movie theater. There's TV dinners

in the freezer. Oh, and Nick - your

father got a job in Ukiah.

NICK

Mom? Do you think it might be a

good idea if I moved in with him?

ESTELLE

Nick, that just wouldn't work. I

depend on that child support money

to eat.

NICK

But shouldn't you depend on the

child support money for, you

know... child support?

53.

ESTELLE

Watch your smart mouth.

NICK (V.O.)

The plan is simple.

NICK (V.O.)

Tow Jerry's trailer to a remote

parking lot in Berkeley and burn it

to the ground.

NICK (V.O.)

Thus evicting myself from my

mother's clutches and into the arms

of My One And Only Love.

NICK (V.O.)

Francois wanted to torch the

trailer where it sits, but I've

convinced him a parking lot will

reduce the risk of collateral

damage.

54.

NICK

Oh no! I forgot to set the brake!

55.

NICK

Hey, Mom! How was the movie?

LANCE

You little shit. You stole your

mother's dead ex-boyfriend's

trailer and set a five million

dollar fire.

NICK/FRANCOIS

I refuse to stand for such

allegations!

ESTELLE

Nick! They have a description of

the arsonist!

LANCE

A white teenage male, about five-

seven. A hundred and twenty five

pounds, dark hair, spotted

complexion...

NICK

That could be anyone.

56.

LANCE

He was also wearing a tee shirt

with the words: I'm single, let's

mingle.

ESTELLE

What am I going to do? My only son

will be sent to prison!

ESTELLE

Oh, Lance, can't something be done?

LANCE

Tell you what, Estelle. I'll make

out that Nick reported the car and

trailer stolen before the fire.

It'll be less suspicious. But I

could take some serious heat for

this.

ESTELLE

Oh, Lance! You're wonderful! How

can I possibly repay you?

LANCE

I'll think of something, Estelle.

LANCE

Now the kid better not be here when

the detectives start coming around.

I'd send him away for a while. A

long while.

ESTELLE

He can go make his father's life

miserable!

NICK

But I like it here.

ESTELLE

You're going, buster!

57.

ESTELLE

You're son just burned down half of

Berkeley! Come and get the little

brat!

LANCE

Wait a minute, Estelle, aren't you

going to punish him? I'd say he

deserves a good hiding.

ESTELLE

(cupping the squawking

PHONE)

He's too much for me anymore. Can

you do it, Lance, darling?

NICK (V.O.)

I don't scream much. I am making a

painful sacrifice for The Woman Of

My Dreams. My suffering possesses a

beauty which elevates it above this

sordid scene.

NICK

Are you through?

LEFTY (O.S.)

Psst. Nick.

NICK

I was wondering what happened to

you. Did you get to blow your wad?

LEFTY

No. I did not get to blow my wad.

58.

NICK

Did you get interrupted?

LEFTY

No. Worse.

NICK

What's worse than being

interrupted?

LEFTY

Millie is a lesbian.

NICK

WHAT?!?

LEFTY

The only reason she wanted to hang

out with me is because she heard

that I showed you my slinky and

thought I was gay too.

NICK

Sorry, man. I didn't have a great

night either.

LEFTY

Well, I dunno what you're gonna do,

but I'm giving suicide serious

consideration this time.

NICK

Or you could just fake it and then

hide out in Ukiah with me. Then

later come back and maybe Millie

Filbert will boink you out of pity.

LEFTY

Hey, that's not a bad idea. Thanks

a pantsful, Nick.

LACEY

Hiya, Nick!

NICK

Hi, Lacey. Hi, Dad.

59.

NICK

Is there any way I could sit up

front with Lacey, Dad? Mom's

boyfriend beat me pretty badly.

GEORGE

Sorry, Nick. In this car, faggots

get the back seat.

GEORGE

My God. Look what you've done.

GEORGE

Go ahead and bring your stuff

inside. Lacey and I need a nap.

C'mon, Sugar Puss.

NICK (V.O.)

What a competitive asshole.

NICK

Uhm, hello. Is Sheeni available?

MR. SAUNDERS

She most certainly is not. As a

matter of fact, we've banned you

from her life, Nick Twisp.

60.

NICK

Excuse me?

MR. SAUNDERS

Trent Preston informed us that not

only were you moving here to pursue

my daughter, but that you're not

even mentally-handicapped, and thus

molested my wife in the shower of

sound mind and body.

NICK

That rat-fink-fuck!

MR. SAUNDERS

You watch your language. This is a

Christian home. We're sending

Sheeni to Les Ecole des Arts and

Literatures in Santa Cruz.

NICK

Santa Cruz! But she'll be miserable

without me. We're in love.

MR. SAUNDERS

Then I guess it's a good thing

Trent is going there too. She'll

have someone to console her.

SHEENI

Nick! Oh, Nick!

SHEENI

I had to sneak away just to see

you.

NICK

That's okay. I had to burn down

half of Berkley.

61.

SHEENI

That was you? Nick, are you out of

your mind?

NICK

I felt a grand gesture was

required, darling.

SHEENI

Nick, Trent betrayed us.

NICK

Francois will kill him later.

SHEENI

Who's Francois?

NICK

Nevermind. The point is we must

elope.

SHEENI

I don't know, Nick. I do love you,

but I don't want to spend the rest

of our lives on the run.

NICK

It's a small price to pay.

SHEENI

I... I can't, Nick.

NICK

What?!? But, Sheeni. I just don't

get it. I'm here. Albert's here

too.

SHEENI

I know, Nick, and I've been longing

for you so. But we'll just have to

find another way. The car is

already packed.

SHEENI

Nick Twisp, I will not allow you to

accept defeat so easily!

(MORE)

62.

SHEENI (cont'd)

When the time is right, you must

make your way to Santa Cruz. And

then we will make love.

NICK

Or we could consummate here in the

woods.

SHEENI

Did you bring the consumer reports?

SHEENI

Then it will have to be Santa Cruz.

I really must go now, darling.

NICK

Well... Goodbye, Sheeni. I love

you.

SHEENI

I love you too. Squeeze darling

Albert for me.

NICK (V.O.)

I have endured a five million

dollar beating for nothing.

(BEAT)

I have been stabbed. Stabbed in the

back.

NICK (V.O.)

I do not have a friend within a

hundred miles. This is a daunting

thought if you think about it.

CUT TO:

63.

DWAYNE

Sorry `bout wompin' ya. I'm Dwayne.

NICK

Nick. Nick Twisp.

DWAYNE

Say, Nick? Why do you suppose guys

got only two testicles when we got

ten fingers and toes?

NICK

I could not begin to speculate.

PAUL

Hey, Nick. I'm Paul, Sheeni's

brother.

NICK

Hello, Paul. How did you know my

name?

PAUL

We've met.

NICK

No we haven't.

PAUL

In a previous life.

NICK

Oh.

PAUL

Nice fire in Berkeley.

64.

NICK

Did Sheeni tell you that was me?

PAUL

She didn't have to.

NICK

Why? Was I an arsonist in a

previous life?

PAUL

No. But Sheeni was.

NICK

My God. What did she burn?

PAUL

Men. Men and boys.

NICK

My God, Francois! What was Paul

smoking?

FRANCOIS

Shut up and go with it.

65.

GEORGE

What the... What the hell?

LACEY

Is..? Is that my bra?

GEORGE

We're calling that fruitcake

display strike one. Two more

strikes and it's back to Oakland.

DWAYNE

Hey, Nick!

NICK

Uh... Hi, Dwayne. What are you

doing here?

DWAYNE

Ain't ya heard. We're gonna be

roommates! Ain't that zinky?

MRS. CRAMPTON

Dwayne, get yer dumb ass back here

and take yer sleepin' pill. You

must be Nick. Wash yer hands, boy.

I don't serve two shifts.

NICK

Uh... Dad? What's going on?

GEORGE

Mrs. Crampton's our new

housekeeper. I'm renting out the

spare room to her seeing as her

camper has been deemed unfit for

human habitation.

66.

NICK

What about Dwayne?

GEORGE

He's bunking with you.

NICK

Dad!

GEORGE

You working on strike two?

DWAYNE

Say, Nick. You wanna sleep in bed

with me? It'll be tons warmer.

NICK

No thank you, Dwayne.

LACEY

This came for you, Nick.

DWAYNE

Is it a love letter, Nick?

NICK

I don't know, it's in French. Say,

why does your mother give you

sleeping pills?

DWAYNE

`Cuz otherwise I'd stay up all

night playin' Nintendo Wii. Say,

Nick, can I walk Albert?

NICK

I don't know. Dogs don't grow on

trees.

DWAYNE

Pleeease, Nick?

67.

NICK

Okay. But it will cost you one

sleeping pill per walk.

DWAYNE

Whatchu want them pills for, Nick?

NICK

You never know when sedatives will

come in handy.

NICK

Lefty?

LEFTY

Oh. Hey, Nick!

NICK

Lefty, what are you doing here?

LEFTY

I live here. The guy's only

charging me fifty in cash a month.

NICK

I mean, what are you doing in town?

LEFTY

I did what you told me, Nick. I

threw my backpack off the pier and

reported my own suicide. I even

left a note.

NICK

Wow, Lefty, I'm kinda impressed.

Faking your suicide is pretty

ballsy.

LEFTY

So where you headed?

68.

NICK

Redwood High School.

LEFTY

Can I come?

NICK

Why would you want to go to school

if you didn't have to?

LEFTY

It's weird, Nick, but school seems

like a pretty fun place to hang out

once you get rid of classes and

homework.

NICK

I can see this stunt really has

liberated your mind.

LEFTY

I'm telling you, Nick: killing

myself was the best thing that ever

happened to me.

VIJAY

May I sit at your table?

LEFTY

Sure. I'm Lefty and this is Nick.

VIJAY

I am Vijay Joshi.

VIJAY

I see you both have been rejected

by the socially elite of our

school. Ukiah is a cultural

wasteland compared to India. Though

some of the girls are very

attractive.

NICK

Do you have a girlfriend?

VIJAY

Not at the moment. But I am

optimistic. How about you?

69.

NICK

Yes, but she transferred.

VIJAY

You don't mean Sheeni Saunders. I

heard she was interested in some

brilliant fellow in the Bay Area.

LEFTY

Hey, that's you, Nick.

VIJAY

I'm surprised. You are not at all

what I imagined.

VIJAY

So how is Sheeni?

NICK

I don't know. She sent me this

letter. But it's in French.

VIJAY

Shall I translate it for you?

NICK

You speak French?

VIJAY

I speak French, English, Hindi,

Marathi, and Urdu.

LEFTY

That must come in handy.

VIJAY

Dear, Nick...

SHEENI (V.O.)

...I am writing you from my room in

Santa Cruz. Surprisingly, boarding

school has proven to be a welcome

liberation as well as...

70.

SHEENI (V.O.)

...a stimulating experience which I

am now not so quick to change.

SHEENI

Perhaps you should consider

learning French and enrolling. That

said...

SHEENI (V.O.)

...English cannot be spoken on

campus even if you are hemorrhaging

from an accidental limb amputation.

SHEENI (V.O.)

I have made friends with the head

of the girls' basketball team. Her

name is Heather, and despite her

popularity, she is saving herself

for college boys.

SHEENI (V.O.)

I have an interesting roommate from

New York named Taggarty...

SHEENI (V.O.)

She has already slept with

seventeen boys and hopes to rack up

fifty before leaving here.

71.

SHEENI (V.O.)

Trent has taken up windsurfing and

has been designated target number

one by all the girls. I am still

very angry at him for the betrayal

but he claims he wants to mend our

friendship.

SHEENI (V.O.)

I guess we shall see.

VIJAY

(READING)

All in all, I'm happy and look

forward to further growth in this

rich, intellectual environment.

NICK

That's it? Nothing else about me?

VIJAY

Oh yes... Love to you and Albert.

(setting down the letter)

Who's Albert?

NICK

Albert is our dog. This is a

disaster. What the hell does she

mean Trent wants to mend the

relationship?

VIJAY

I don't know, but this Taggarty

girl sounds very uninhibited. I

wonder if she's made it with a

Hindu yet.

LEFTY

Heather sounds like a babe. You

think if I grew a beard I'd pass

for college age?

NICK

I've got to get to Sheeni as soon

as possible. If I don't Trent

Preston is going to mindfuck her

into thinking she doesn't like me.

72.

LEFTY

And then he'll probably fuck her in

other ways. Did you know you're

supposed to put your pinkie in a

girl's bumhole, Vijay?

NICK

Will you shut up and help me out?

LEFTY

Sorry, Nick. What should we do?

NICK

I suggest we steal my father's BMW

and take a trip to Santa Cruz.

Vijay, you'll have to be our

translator.

VIJAY

But what will we tell our parents?

LEFTY

You can tell your father you are

staying at Nick's house for the

weekend. And visa versa.

NICK

Good thinking.

VIJAY

But what if we are caught?

NICK

To hell with it, Vijay. It's time

to take action!

LEFTY

What is this music, Nick?

NICK

It's Dave Brubeck.

(to Vijay)

I thought a person as cultured as

yourself would appreciate it.

73.

VIJAY

You want culture? I will give you

culture.

SHEENI

Nickie?

NICK

Hello, Sheeni.

(to Taggarty and Heather)

Hi, I'm Nick.

TAGGARTY

Oh. So you're Nick.

HEATHER

We've heard so much about you.

NICK

And this is Vijay. And this is

Lefty. Lefty goes to USC.

74.

LEFTY

And I'm not gay.

SHEENI

Nick, I knew you'd come!

SHEENI

...but you must wait in the car

until we can sneak you in.

HEATHER

Lefty, should maybe sleep in my

room. It's pretty crowded in here.

LEFTY

Your roommate won't mind?

HEATHER

Oh, Darlene went home for the

weekend.

LEFTY

Well, see you guys in the morning.

SHEENI

Pardon me, everyone.

75.

NICK

There's your competition.

VIJAY

A distinguished group I would be

happy to join.

VIJAY

I am in a state of sexual frenzy.

What is your plan?

NICK

We drape a blanket over the lower

bunk for Sheeni and me. You tackle

Taggarty on the top bunk. Here's a

condom. I slipped two to Lefty,

leaving us with four.

VIJAY

What if they don't go for it?

NICK

They'll go for it. You can cut the

sexual tension in that room with a

knife.

SHEENI

Don't be silly, darling. Not with

others in the room.

(leaning in to whisper)

We must wait until everyone falls

asleep.

TAGGERTY

Goodnight boys. Do you need the

light on to take off your clothes?

NICK

No.

(flipping off the light)

We can find our zippers in the

dark.

76.

NICK

Sheeni?

SHEENI

Yes, Nick?

NICK

Was that the matron?

SHEENI

No.

NICK

Then who was it?

SHEENI

It was Trent.

NICK

Did you say it was Trent?

SHEENI

Yes. He came to discuss our

friendship. I told him now was not

the time.

NICK

So where is Trent now?

SHEENI

I assume he went back to the boys'

dorm. Now really, Nickie, you are

keeping everyone awake with your

inquiries.

77.

FRANCOIS

Now is our chance.

NICK

Chance for what?

FRANCOIS

To confront our nemesis. We must go

to the boys' dorm and kill Trent

where he sleeps.

NICK

I suppose we should at least get a

look at him. To see what we're

dealing with.

FRANCOIS

Very well.

(stubbing out his

CIGARETTE)

You see what we are dealing with...

and zen I wll deal wiz it.

NICK

Trent?

ED

No. Who the hell are you?

78.

NICK

I am Nick Twisp.

ED

Oh, so you're Nick.

NICK

Is Trent here?

ED

You just missed him, Nick. He just

grabbed a couple condoms and left.

NICK

Did he say where he was going?

ED

I think he said he was going to

Heather's room.

NICK

But that's where Lefty is. Who are

you?

ED

Ed. Ed Solomon. Trent's roommate.

NICK

Oh, so you're Ed.

ED

What's that supposed to mean?

NICK

Nothing. It's just that Sheeni

mentioned Trent has a thing for a

guy named Ed, and that he touches

the guy when he falls asleep. But

obviously if that were you, you'd

know about it. Must be a different

Ed Solomon. Take care now.

79.

HEATHER

What's up, Nick?

NICK

Is Trent in there?

HEATHER

Not anymore.

NICK

What happened to Lefty?

LEFTY (O.S.)

I'm right here, Nick.

HEATHER

Trent was here, but he left. He

only dropped by to lend us a couple

more condoms.

NICK

But I gave Lefty two already.

HEATHER

Yes, and that was very generous of

you, but the night is young.

NICK

So what is Trent, the fucking

condom faerie!?!

LEFTY

You can have one of ours, Nick. If

you need one.

NICK

So where did he say he was going?

HEATHER

He didn't say, but I'm pretty sure

I just saw him go into our bathroom

down the hall.

80.

NICK

Thanks. Oh, and I'd be careful with

those condoms. Trent's roommate Ed

said that Trent pokes holes in them

so that he can get Sheeni pregnant

and be with her forever.

BERNICE

Who are you?

NICK

I'm Sheeni's friend, Nick. Sorry to

disturb you.

BERNICE

That's OK. It was something I ate.

So wait, are you Sheeni's

boyfriend?

NICK

Uh, yeah.

BERNICE

My name's Bernice. Bernice Lynch.

Not that you asked.

NICK

Nice to meet you Bernice. Actually,

I think Trent Preston mentioned

you. He said you were frumpy, but

now that I've met you, I can see

Trent is a lying bastard.

BERNICE

Thanks. And Trent can go to hell

for all I care. Sheeni too.

NICK

You don't like Sheeni?

81.

BERNICE

Personally, I hate her guts. Well,

pardon me, Nick. I feel like

throwing up some more now.

NICK

You didn't happen to see Trent

Preston did you?

BERNICE

I did actually. I think he was on

his way to Sheeni's room.

NICK

Sheeni?

SHEENI

Yes, darling.

NICK

Was Trent here?

SHEENI

Yes, Nick.

SHEENI

But I sent him away again.

SHEENI

Because I want you, darling. Not

even Trent can match the

industriousness and tenacity with

which you have pursued me.

82.

MATRON

Q'est que c'est passer ici?!?

LEFTY

I did it three times! Two long ones

and a quickie.

NICK

Great. Just great. How about you,

Vijay?

VIJAY

It was difficult to tell with that

condom, Nick. Why did you buy such

thick ones?

NICK

That brand was top-rated by

Consumers.

83.

VIJAY

Well, she's safe. No organism could

penetrate those walls.

NICK

You think the girls are in trouble?

VIJAY

They will likely notify their

parents. Perhaps even expel them.

NICK

That's it! Expel them. Then Sheeni

will have to come back to Ukiah.

VIJAY

What will we do?

NICK

Well, we can't stay in the car.

Sooner or later Highway Patrol is

going to come by and ask for our

non-existent driver's license.

LEFTY

But we have no money!

VIJAY

I have no shoes! I'll catch

pneumonia and die a indeterminate

proto-quasi-virgin!

ESTELLE (V.O.)

Hello?

NICK

(into phone)

Mom? It's Nick. I'm sorry to wake

you, but I'm hoping you'll help

your only son. Especially seeing as

it would really piss off Dad.

84.

ESTELLE (V.O.)

Where are you, Nick?

WALLY

Pardon me. But is one of you Nick

Twisp?

NICK

Yeah. I'm Nick.

WALLY

I'm Wally. I'm a friend of your

mom's.

WALLY

So, uhm, uh... Your mom says you

need a ride. Did I mention I'm a

friend?

ESTELLE

Wally was a friend of Jerry's. He

came to help me in my time of

mourning.

85.

NICK

What happened to Lance?

ESTELLE

Lance is busy training to be a

detective. He isn't around as much

as he used to be.

ESTELLE

Mr. Rumpkin is very smart. Ask him

a question, Nick.

NICK

Okay. Mr. Rumpkin, what famous

actress was married to Frank

Sinatra, Artie Shaw, and Mickey

Rooney?

LEFTY

Whoever she is, she sure gets

around.

WALLY

Ava Gardner.

ESTELLE

That's nothing. You should see what

he did with the living room.

ESTELLE

Go ahead, Wally. Show them.

86.

NICK, LEFTY, VIJAY

Ooooooh.

NICK, LEFTY, VIJAY

Aaaaaaah.

WALLY

Well, uhm... It was nice meeting

you, Nick.

NICK

You too, Mr. Rumpkin.

NICK

Where's Dad?

LACEY

In the bedroom. I wouldn't bother

him, Nick. He's in a foul mood.

He's on with the police. Apparently

someone broke in and stole his

Beamer.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Lacey! Get in here!

87.

DWAYNE

Nick, you got a girlfriend?

NICK

Yes, I do.

DWAYNE

If you asked your girlfriend as a

favor, would she do it with me?

NICK

Guys don't share their girlfriends.

DWAYNE

I get ya. You're worried `cause

your girlfriend might get knocked

up. What if I pull out, Nick?

LACEY

It's not my fault, you tight-assed,

critical, nonfeeling, sexist drunk.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Sticks and stones. It doesn't

bother me if you sleep on the couch

from now on.

LACEY

Does it bother you that you're a

selfish, uptight, boring lover?

NICK

You forgot lousy driver!

GEORGE

That's strike two, jerkoff!

LACEY

Hello?

(PAUSE)

Thank you.

88.

LACEY

They found your car in Davenport,

George. Go pick it up.

GEORGE

Look who's wearing the pants this

morning.

LACEY

Nick, I feel for you. It must be

tough being a teenager in this

house.

NICK

My mother wasn't any better.

LACEY

Your mom has had a difficult time.

She has had a great deal to put up

with. I'm starting to appreciate

that now.

GEORGE

Are you by any chance referring to

me?

LACEY

If the shoe fits, suck on it.

GEORGE

We'll see who's sucking on what

soon.

VIJAY

I spoke with Taggarty this morning.

She requested a wallet sized photo.

LEFTY

Congratulations, Vijay. That makes

it official. Welcome to the club.

NICK

What grade did you receive?

89.

VIJAY

A C+. Which I feel is perfectly

satisfactory given the conditions.

LEFTY

I guess this means they're not

being expelled.

VIJAY

No, apparently they convinced the

matron it was all quite innocent.

NICK

Are you kidding? She had her

flashlight trained on your Hindi

boner!

VIJAY

No need to be jealous, Nick.

NICK (V.O.)

If I'm to get Sheeni expelled and

sent back to me I will need a

partner in crime.

NICK (V.O.)

Luckily, Francois has a girl on the

inside.

NICK

Dear Bernice, it was nice meeting

you this weekend in the bathroom.

NICK (V.O.)

I just want you to know I now see

why you loath Sheeni Saunders so

strongly.

90.

NICK (V.O.)

I too have come to despise the

snooty, pretentious brunette and in

all honesty you should probably get

her expelled. I am happy to help in

that regard.

NICK (V.O.)

I have included a number of

sleeping pills with this note.

NICK (V.O.)

You must introduce one of these

into her breakfast beverage each

day.

NICK (V.O.)

She may be intelligent, but she is

not likely to pass her courses when

she's falling asleep in class.

NICK (V.O.)

Since meeting you, I have come to

realize my interest in Sheeni was

only a transient adolescent

infatuation. I like you more than I

can say. Take courage. Together we

will outsmart these cake eaters.

NICK (V.O.)

Affectionately yours, Nick.

91.

NICK (V.O.)

P.S. Please destroy this note

immediately.

NICK

Where's Dad?

LACEY

(DREAMILY)

Daddy is in Davenport. Where you

left his car.

PAUL

We saved you some mushrooms, Nick.

92.

LACEY

Nick? Get the phone?

NICK

(into phone)

Hello?

GEORGE

Nick? Is that you?

NICK

I am Nick Twisp. I am alive. I am a

breathing organism.

GEORGE

Quit fooling around, Nick. This is

your dad. Is everything okay there?

NICK

Don't be afraid, Dad. Everything

will be okay. You deserve to be

loved.

GEORGE

What the hell is that supposed to

mean? Is Lacey there?

NICK

Lacey is here. Paul is caressing

her toes.

GEORGE

Paul! Who the hell is Paul?

93.

NICK

Paul is our friend. He makes

beautiful music for the acrobats.

They're naked.

GEORGE

Who's naked? Is Lacey naked?

NICK

Don't be afraid, Dad. Goodbye.

NICK

Dad is afraid.

LACEY

He is on the wrong path. I have

felt that for some time.

PAUL

Okay, George, just calm down.

GEORGE

You are in serious trouble. You've

assaulted me and I know for a fact

that you two were having naked

orgies with my son. That child is

only twelve years old.

NICK

I'm sixteen, Dad.

94.

GEORGE

Shut your pie hole!

(turning to Lacey and

PAUL)

That boy is an underaged minor. I'm

going to have you arrested and

charged with child molesting.

LACEY

Don't be an idiot, George. No one

was naked.

GEORGE

When you get out of prison, you

will both have to register as sex

offenders. You will never be able

to get a decent job again.

PAUL

I've never had a decent job. I

don't think I'd want one.

LACEY

Let's go, Paul. George, I'll pick

up the rest of my things tomorrow.

GEORGE

Not until you pay me the rest of

the money you owe.

LACEY

I paid you all your money!

GEORGE

Not the extra charges.

LACEY

Fuck-your-stinking-extra-charges.

GEORGE (O.S.)

Using bad language in front of a

minor. The judge will hear about

that too.

DWAYNE

What's all the ruckus about?

95.

NICK

Dwayne! Please cover yourself.

DWAYNE

You wanna play Nintendo all night?

NICK

Of course not. I'm tired. Let's go

to sleep.

NICK (V.O.)

A strange night. I dreamed of

wrestling for what seemed like

hours with an amorous walrus...

NICK (V.O.)

There is only one explanation: I

have been Dwayned.

NICK

Wake up! I know what you were doing

last night, you disgusting beast!

DWAYNE

Don't be mad, Nick. I like you.

MRS. CRAMPTON

Boys, time to get-- AHH! Dwayne!

Where's yer pajamas?

DWAYNE

Nick made me take them off, Mom. He

took off his too.

MRS. CRAMPTON

You leave my son alone. Don't go

co'rupt him with yer nastiness!

96.

NICK

We weren't doing anything, Mrs.

Crampton. It was just hot last

night.

MRS. CRAMPTON

If you get hot, boys, open a

window. Don't go takin' off yer

pajamas. That's nasty.

TAGGARTY (V.O.)

Bonjour.

NICK

Taggarty? It's Nick.

TAGGARTY

Hey, Nick. I suppose you want to

talk to Sheeni.

NICK

If you please.

TAGGARTY

It's your would-be-lover.

SHEENI

Nick?

NICK

Hello, My Beloved. How are you?

SHEENI

Not so well. I have been afflicted

with some kind of chronic fatigue.

NICK

Perhaps you are home sick. You do

sound rather blue.

97.

SHEENI

NICK

SHEENI

NICK

SHEENI

NICK

SHEENI

(SIGHS)

NICK

SHEENI

NICK

SHEENI

NICK

98.

SHEENI

Tomorrow?

NICK

Yes, Sheeni, Thanksgiving. I'll be

coming for dinner, of course.

SHEENI

Don't even think it, Nick. You know

my parents don't approve of you.

NICK

I'm confident they will learn to

love me. After all, I'm practically

family.

SHEENI

Nick, you must dismiss this

Thanksgiving notion from your mind.

I remain firm on this issue.

Goodbye.

NICK

Don't move, blubber boy, I'll get

it.

POLICE OFFICER

Is George Twisp in?

NICK

Uh, I'm pretty sure he's sleeping

off a hangover, Officer. Is he

under arrest?

POLICE OFFICER

Under arrest? No, I'm the officer

working the case of his stolen car.

NICK

Ah.

POLICE OFFICER

You can tell your pop that the CD

he found in his car is Ravi

Shankar.

99.

NICK

Excuse me?

POLICE OFFICER

Indian music. So we're a checkin'

the INS files, see if we can get

some prints that match. You

wouldn't know anyone who might have

stolen the car who listens to this

crap, would ya, son?

NICK

No, and I'm not sure I like the

implication. Ravi Shankar is

beloved by many Caucasian...

DWAYNE (O.S.)

What about Vijay Joshi?

DWAYNE

I'm pretty sure he's Injun.

POLICE OFFICER

(to himself)

Vijay Joshi. We'll look into it.

Thank you, boys.

NICK (V.O.)

Mrs. Crampton complained to Dad

that I tried to corrupt the fat

pervert cohabitating with me.

NICK (V.O.)

He has deemed it strike three, but

is only banishing me as far as Mrs.

Crampton's condemned trailer.

100.

NICK (V.O.)

No matter. Tomorrow I will be

reunited with My Everlasting Love.

And I will not be stopped. Not by

an outbreak of the plague, nor by a

cruel return of the ice-age. Not

even by the Gods themselves.

NICK

Twisp residence.

ESTELLE (V.O.)

Nick?

NICK

Oh. Hey, Mom. What's up?

ESTELLE (V.O.)

Nickie, I have some bad news!

NICK

Okay. I'm ready. What is it?

ESTELLE (V.O.)

I'm afraid Lance and Wally got into

a terrible row. He tried to arrest

Wally and Wally broke Lance's jaw.

101.

NICK

What's the bad news?

ESTELLE (V.O.)

The Berkeley police know you

started the fire. Lance told them

where you are.

ESTELLE (V.O.)

Nick, they're coming to arrest you!

LEFTY (O.S.)

Nick?

NICK

Lefty, have you seen Vijay, today?

LEFTY

Nick, haven't you heard? Vijay's

been arrested.

NICK

Arrested?!?

LEFTY

For grand theft auto. They found

his prints in your father's car.

NICK

That's terrible. Did he go quietly?

LEFTY

No. He said you were his accomplice

and now the Ukiah police are

looking for you!

102.

NICK (V.O.)

The day has proven to be a

disaster. Where did I gone wrong? I

have a decision to make.

NICK (V.O.)

I could hit the road and spend my

life a fugitive with my integrity

nearly intact.

NICK (V.O.)

It's that or risk incarceration to

keep my dinner date.

(BEAT)

Obviously the answer is clear.

PAUL

Hello, Nick. Right on time. Come

in.

NICK

Happy Thanksgiving, Lacey.

103.

LACEY

What interesting flowers, Nick. Who

are they for?

NICK

Uh, Mrs. Saunders.

LACEY

Mr. and Mrs. Saunders, you remember

Nick Twisp, don't you?

MR. SAUNDERS

You are very, very tall.

PAUL

No he's not, Dad. He just appears

tall because you are on the floor.

MR. SAUNDERS

I can feel the floor pushing

against me. Can you feel it too,

tall youth?

LACEY

Paul served an appetizer earlier.

PAUL

Yes, it's a recipe I picked up in

the Southwest. Stuffed mushrooms.

TAGGERTY (O.S.)

Hello, Nick.

TAGGERTY

How is the star-crossed persistent

lover?

104.

NICK

Okay, I guess. Where's Sheeni?

TAGGERTY

Upstairs, Nick. She saw you coming

and hid in her room.

NICK

Dinner is almost ready, My Love.

SHEENI

I do not intend to be party to my

brother's absurdities. He has

allowed you in and drugged my

parents.

NICK

I think they are deriving some good

from the experience.

SHEENI

What are you doing here, Nick? I

expressly asked you not to come.

NICK

To hell with that. What do I have

to do to prove my love to you? My

friends have gotten laid and I'm

pretty sure neither one of them was

beaten with a tree trunk, raped by

a walrus, or had to contend with

the likes of Trent Preston!

SHEENI

You were raped by a walrus?

NICK

Sheeni, I have shown restraint, I

have committed crimes, I have

traveled to the lengths of the

state and still you won't give me

this one little thing.

SHEENI

Sex, Nick. Why don't you just say

it? That's what you want. You want

me to have sex with you.

105.

NICK

(BEAT)

Well... YEAH!

SHEENI

How is my dog?

NICK

Excellent. He should be coming out

of the oven right about now.

SHEENI

I hate you, Nickie!

NICK

I hate you too.

LACEY

Dear Lord...

LACEY

Dear Lord, thank you for this

bounty. Help us to be tolerant of

others - especially the boyfriends

and girlfriends of our immediate

relations. Amen.

EVERYONE

Amen.

106.

MRS. SAUNDERS

Paul? Your father looks rather

strange.

PAUL

Well, mother, he is sitting in his

own bowel movement.

MRS. SAUNDERS

That's no excuse.

TAGGARTY

The food is delicious, Paul.

PAUL

Thank you.

(BEAT)

Sister, darling, how long has it

been since we all observed the

rituals of Thanksgiving?

SHEENI

Not long enough, Paul.

NICK

I hope it's the first of many such

occasions for me.

MRS. SAUNDERS

Siiiilent night, Hooooly night/

Aaaall in calm, aaall is bright...

EVERYONE

Round yon virgin Mother and Child/

Holy infant so tender and mild/

Sleep in heavenly peace... Sle-eep

in heavenly pee-eace.

107.

TAGGARTY

Oh, Trent, you made it.

TRENT

Hello, Taggarty. Hello, Everyone.

SHEENI

Trent, darling, this is Nick.

TRENT

Nick, at last we meet.

NICK

Hello, Trent.

TAGGARTY

Have a seat, Trent.

TRENT

I'm sorry, Taggarty, I can't stay.

I have bad news.

SHEENI

What is it?

TRENT

Bernice Lynch has tried to commit

suicide.

TRENT

She swallowed a number of sleeping

pills, and is now in a coma.

SHEENI

The poor girl.

TRENT

There's more. Before I left school,

I searched her room.

108.

NICK

Did you obtain proper authorization

from the officials?

TRENT

No, Nick, I acted on my own

initiative. In Bernice's closet, I

found this letter.

TRENT

In the letter, the writer

instructed Bernice to begin

sedating Sheeni with drugs he

himself supplied.

TAGGARTY

Nick, you didn't!

NICK

Well, you see...

SHEENI

Nick! You could have killed me!

MR. SAUNDERS

Who died?

TRENT

No one yet, Mr. Saunders.

MRS. SAUNDERS

ARREST HIM!

TRENT

I can't arrest him. But I have

called the Santa Cruz Police. They

are on their way here now.

NICK

Well, I shall be going now. Please

continue without me.

TRENT

Nick, I suggest you remain here and

face the consequences like a man.

109.

NICK

Thank you for that unsolicited

counsel, Trent. And please, do drop

dead.

NICK

Goodbye, Sheeni. I did it all for

you.

SHEENI

You are completely contemptible,

Nick Twisp. I never wish to see you

again.

NICK (V.O.)

Here I am, reviled by friends and

family. Relentlessly pursued by

three police jurisdictions.

NICK (V.O.)

Froncois suggests we flee the

country. But where to go? Mexico?

Canada? India, perhaps?

NICK

Uh, Hi, Joanie. How's it going?

JOANIE

Nick?

110.

NICK (V.O.)

Since my sister can see through me,

I'm obliged to give a relatively

candid and thorough review of the

events.

JOANIE

Nick, six months ago you were just

another brownnosing honor student.

What happened?

NICK

I'm not really sure. I fell in love

with Sheeni. All I want is to be

with her. The rest is all a big

misunderstanding.

JOANIE

Nick, you've stolen, vandalized,

trespassed, and burned down

Berkeley. All for one girl. If

there's a misunderstanding, it's

with your insight into females.

NICK

But... But where did I go wrong?

JOANIE

Nick, boys your age are always

looking for the path of least

resistance to becoming a man. A

boy's whole self-esteem rests on

how fast he can get a girl into

bed.

NICK

So far, I agree.

JOANIE

Sooner or later what those boys

realize, is that the girls you're

chasing base their self-esteem on

how many hoops they can get the boy

to jump through before going to bed

with him.

JOANIE

So I guess what you should ask

yourself is: How far are you

willing to go?

111.

NICK

All the way, Joanie. I'm willing to

go all the way.

JOANIE

You can stay here a couple days,

but eventually they'll come looking

for you. I don't have much money to

give you, but here.

NICK

Thanks, Joanie. I... Uh... I love

you.

JOANIE

I love you too, you little brat.

NICK

One ticket to Ukiah, please.

LANCE

Yeah.

NICK (V.O.)

Hey, bacon boy, it's Nick.

LANCE

Nick, ya little prick, where are

ya?

NICK

You're on a need to know basis,

gorilla boy.

112.

LANCE

No matter, they'll get you

eventually.

NICK

Let me make it easy. I'll be at

Redwood High School tomorrow

morning. Round up your donut

dipping friends. I'm turning myself

in.

NICK

Lefty?

LEFTY

Nick? What are you doing here?

Everyone and their mother's mother

is looking for you.

NICK

They have me soon enough. Where are

you going?

LEFTY

Home. I'm done being dead, Nick.

Heather and I are going back to

Oakland for Christmas. You should

have heard how glad my parents were

that I didn't kill myself. They

were even happier when they found

out I'm not gay.

NICK

That's great, Lefty.

LEFTY

Yeah, being in love is pretty

great. So what's your plan, Nick?

113.

PAUL

Welcome back, Nick. We had a

feeling you were coming.

NICK (V.O.)

Paul and Lacey are kind enough to

share some leftover fungi to help

calm my nerves. That, combined with

yet another viewing of James Dean's

performance is what gives me my

final burst of inspiration.

NICK (V.O.)

Francois of course wants no part of

this, and demands that we make a

run for the border. But I have

decided to veto him. It's time to

face the music.

DISSOLVE TO:

114.

DISSOLVE TO:

TINA

This is Tina Manion reporting live

at Redwood High in Ukiah where

local law enforcement as well as

the FBI awaits the promised arrival

of Nick Twisp.

GEORGE

Hey. That's my car!

115.

116.

NICK (V.O.)

My only comfort regarding my

untimely death is knowing my

friends and family will do just

fine without me.

NICK (V.O.)

As it would turn out Heather's

vaginal canal is slightly

misshapen...

NICK (V.O.)

...and thus completely compatible

with Lefty's otherwise incongruent

penis.

HEATHER

A little to the right... a

little... RIGHT THERE! RIGHT THERE!

RIGHTTHERERIGHTTHERERIGHTTHERE!

NICK (V.O.)

Vijay would eventually manage to

pin the car theft on me. But had

lost the attention of Taggarty

forever. Who by the way...

NICK (V.O.)

...never would find her perfect A.

NICK (V.O.)

And would therefore start grading

on a curve.

117.

NICK (V.O.)

Joanie of course would get to

continue to travel the world...

NICK   (V.O.)

...and she and   her breasts would

probably go on   to have the

wonderful life   that they deserve.

NICK (V.O.)

Wally as it turns out...

NICK (V.O.)

...would go on Jeopardy and win,

ensuring my mother's blessed rise

to a higher economic status.

NICK (V.O.)

...my father, no longer burdened

with crippling child support

payments, would now be able to

afford the model BMW he always

wanted...

118.

NICK (V.O.)

...and would come to find the

surrogate son he always wanted in

Dwayne, the only organism alive

that could possibly appreciate

George's driving.

NICK (V.O.)

Leaving just one last piece of

business.

SHEENI

Excuse me. Are you a friend of

Nick's?

NICK/CARLOTTA

A terribly old friend. Carlotta

Ulanksy. I'm sorry for your loss.

SHEENI

You shouldn't be, Carlotta. I am no

doubt culpable for Nick's actions.

NICK/CARLOTTA

Well, love does compel us to

desperate acts. People cannot

always act rationally.

(MORE)

119.

NICK/CARLOTTA (cont'd)

The greater the love, the stronger

the passions, the more reckless the

crimes.

SHEENI

Yes, Carlotta. Nick had wonderful a

way of making me feel worthy of the

pursuit.

NICK/CARLOTTA

My dear, if there's one thing the

demise of Nick Twisp has taught me,

it's that self worth comes from

within.

SHEENI

Would you like to stay the night,

Carlotta? We can reminisce of our

departed.

NICK/CARLOTTA

Oh, my. A kind offer, but I really

must...

SHEENI

It's just... I don't think I could

bear to be alone tonight.

NICK/CARLOTTA

Goodness. What an attractive

negligee.

SHEENI

Do you like it? I bought it in

Santa Rosa last fall. I had hoped

to wear it for Nick.

NICK/CARLOTTA

Oh, darling, I'm sure he would have

found it most... Appealing.

120.

SHEENI

I like lying here with you,

Carlotta.

NICK/CARLOTTA

You do?

SHEENI

I can't think of anyone I'd rather

lie here with.

SHEENI

Except maybe Nick. If Nick were

here, what do you suppose he would

do to me?

NICK/CARLOTTA

Make love to you I would think.

SHEENI

Then why don't you?

NICK/CARLOTTA

Pardon?

SHEENI

Take off that silly wig and make

love to me!

NICK

Sheeni! You knew!

SHEENI

Of course, Nick. Did you really

expect to fool your soul mate with

such a disguise?

SHEENI

Take me darling!

121.

SHEENI

My parents are at services. They

won't be back for hours.

NICK

Shall we have breakfast, my love?

SHEENI

What a lovely notion, darling. You

go ahead downstairs and get things

started.

NICK

What are you doing?

SHEENI

Calling Taggarty to report that you

are not completely incompetent in

the bedroom.

NICK

Do I get to stay and hear my grade?

SHEENI

Not a chance, Mr. Twisp. Such

things are reserved for girl talk

only. And for good reason.

NICK

Very well, Sheeni. Don't be long.

NICK

Well, good morning, Francois. What

do you think?

122.

FRANCOIS

What do I sink? I sink now's are

chance to run for ze hills.

NICK

What do you mean?

FRANCOIS

Nick, we are young, yes? Is the

world not our oyster? Beaucoup des

filles. Do you not want to know

what it is like to make love to

another girl?

NICK

I do, but... We've come so far.

What about Sheeni?

FRANCOIS

Forget Sheeni. Yes, she will always

be ze first conquest, but all zis

time you saught zis was ze end, ze

one and only, when in fact it is

only ze beginning.

NICK

Sheeni, the police are here!

NICK

Quick! Maybe I can sneak out the

back!

MEGAPHONE (O.S.)

NICK TWISP! WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED!

NICK

I don't understand. How do they

even know I'm alive?

SHEENI (O.S.)

Well, I called them of course.

123.

NICK

Well, thanks a pantsful!

SHEENI

But, Nickie, it had to be done.

NICK

But... but why?

SHEENI

I can't very well marry a wanted

man, honey. Look at it this way, in

a few months you'll be a free man

and we can be together in Paris.

FRANCOIS

You might as well break it to her

now, Nick.

NICK (V.O.)

Francois is right of course, but on

the other hand, why be cruel? After

all, Sheeni had managed to give me

hope every step of the way. And if

hope is what Sheeni would now need

to go on, well then...

NICK

As always, you are right, my love.

FRANCOIS

Merd.

124.

NICK (V.O.)

Arrested? Ha. It may not appear so,

but the truth is... I've got the

world on a string.

SHEENI

Write often, Nickie.

NICK

I will, darling.

SHEENI

And don't worry about Albert. He'll

be waiting for you too.

NICK (V.O.)

As Francois would remind me, I'm

intelligent, healthy, virile, not

violently ugly... On the whole I am

splendidly equipped for this great

adventure we call the human

existence.

NICK (V.O.)

Besides, what jury would convict a

teenager who acted out of love?

And even if I do get to spend the

next few months of my youth getting

Dwayned by the inmates of the

California Juvenile Correctional

System, I did get my thirty two

minutes of lovemaking with one of

the most outstanding girls of this

or any other epoch.

NICK (V.O.)

But was it all worth it?

125.

NICK (V.O.)

You bet your left nut it was.

THE END
