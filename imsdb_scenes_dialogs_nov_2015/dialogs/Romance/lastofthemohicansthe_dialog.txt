THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS

Written by

Michael Mann & Christopher Crowe

CHINGACHGOOK

(low Mohican; sub-titled)

We're sorry to kill you, Brother.

Forgive us. I do honor to your courage and

speed, your strength ...

CHINGACHGOOK

Halloo! John Cameron!

CAMERON

Alexandria! Set three more places.

(to the fence)

How is Chingachgook, then?

CHINGACHGOOK

The Master of Life is good. Another year pass ...

How is it with you, John?

CAMERON

Gettin' along. Yes, it is.

(warm)

Nathaniel.

HAWKEYE

Hello John. Cleared another quarter, I see.

CAMERON

(shakes hands with Uncas)

Yes, I did.

ALEXANDRIA

If Uncas is with you, that means he has not

found a woman and started a family yet.

CHINGACHGOOK

Your eyes are too sharp, Alexandria Cameron.

They see into my heart.

UNCAS

Your farm good to you this year, John?

CAMERON

It was a good year for corn.

UNCAS

Mohawk field we saw was 5 mile long on

the river. Chief Joseph Brandt's field.

CAMERON

You take much fur?

HAWKEYE

That we did. John. But the horicane

(sic)

is near trapped out.

JACK

Tradin' your skins in Castleton?

UNCAS

No, Schylerville. With the Dutch for silver.

French & English want to buy with wampum

& brandy.

HAWKEYE

So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?

JACK

A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's

heading south to war against the English. I'm

here to raise this county's militia to aid the

British defense.

HAWKEYE

Folks here goin' to join in that fight?

JACK

We'll see in the morning ...

CHINGACHGOOK

Fathers of England & France, both, take more

land, furs, than they need. They're cold & full

of greed ...

JACK

Few'd deny that? Where you headin'?

HAWKEYE

Trap over the fall and winter among the

Delawares in Can-tuck-ee.

UNCAS

So I can find a woman and make Mohican

children so our father will leave my brother

& me in peace.

JAMES

A son like me?

UNCAS

No. You are too strong. Turn me old

too fast!

ALEXANDRIA

That's what he's doin' to his mama ...

CAMERON

Dear Father, thank you for rewardin' the fruits

of our labor with plenty. Amen.

HENRI

(O.S. in French)

MARTIN

(translates)

My father says he was driven out of France by

the black robe priests and he would fight them

now but he lost his arm and so I will go in his

place.

ONGEWASGONE

John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ...

Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les

Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les

Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ...

mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former

ONGEWASGONE

(continues)

Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais.

My brothers have asked me to lead them in this

war so I speak for the Twin River Council.

LIEUTENANT

His Majesty King George II is very grateful for

your support.

IAN

How far up the valley?

LIEUTENANT

To Fort William Henry.

COLONIAL #1

... two days from here.

LIEUTENANT

It should be enough to remind you France is

the enemy.

HAWKEYE

Your enemy ...

LIEUTENANT

What did you say?

HAWKEYE

(loud)

I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours.

LIEUTENANT

Really? Do you want them to overrun all

New York colony?

HAWKEYE

First place, you started it with the French over

fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.

(smiles)

Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on

their hands ...

LIEUTENANT

(ignoring Hawkeye)

Will you men help us stop the French?

HAWKEYE

... and while they are cooped up in your fort,

what if the French send war parties to raid

their homes?

IAN

What then, Lieutenant?

LIEUTENANT

For your own homes, for king, for country, that's

why you men ought to join this fight!

HAWKEYE

You do what you want with your own scalp.

Do not be tellin' us what to do

with ours.

LIEUTENANT

(furious; to Hawkeye)

You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?

HAWKEYE

... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject

at all.

COLONIAL #2

Nathaniel's right. But if I got to fight, figure I'll

try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of

my bean field.

AD LIBS

Yes. Yeah. No ...

CAMERON

I am stayin' on my farm. And any man who goes,

his family is welcome to fort-up with us 'til he

comes back.

JACK

Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to

fill the county's levy. But only if General Webb

accepts a few terms I got in mind ...

AD LIBS

(O.S.)

Webb? what's that, Jack ...?

IAN

You boys marchin' with us? What do you say?

UNCAS

We had our say, Ian.

REGIMENTAL SGT. MAJOR

(shouts)

Shoulder arms!

(slam)

Order arms! Handle cartridge!

(men bite the paper)

Prime!

(powder dropped in pan)

Load! Draw ramrods! Ram cartridge! Return ramrod!

Make ready!

(muskets at chest height)

Pre-sent!

(muskets shouldered)

Make ready!

(muskets returned to chests)

Pre-sent!

(muskets returned to shoulder)

Fire!

SERGEANT MAJOR

Prime! Load!

JACK

(O.S.)

... if they are not allowed leave to defend their

families if the French or Hurons attack the

settlements, no colonial militia is goin' to Fort

William Henry.

HEYWARD

(low)

You, there. Help my man outside with the baggage.

LIEUTENANT

They will report or be pressed into service!

LARGE COLONIAL REP

Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear into

forest ... time it takes you to blink. Where's that

leave ya, then?

LIEUTENANT

They will be found! Arrested ...

WEBB

(cuts in)

I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence,

would ever object to his American subjects

defending their hearth & home, their women & children,

if threatened by the "scourge" of attack from savages,

aroused to such excess by our enemy, the

ever-perfidious French.

JACK

Does that mean they will be granted leave to

defend their homes if the settlements are

attacked?

WEBB

Of course.

JACK

You got yourself a colonial militia, General.

HEYWARD

Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir!

WEBB

Duncan. How was your journey?

HEYWARD

I didn't experience anything so surprising from

Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.

WEBB

And what is that?

HEYWARD

The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?

WEBB

I know.

(assuming a co-commiserator)

One has to give Americans "reasons" and make

agreements to get them to do anything at all.

Tiring, isn't it?

(throws up his hands)

But that's the way of it here.

HEYWARD

(tight)

I thought British policy is 'Make the

World ... England', sir.

WEBB

You will take command of the 62nd Regiment

of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel

Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.

HEYWARD

Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard

from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to

rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them

to the fort.

WEBB

Yes. You may.

(to Magua, after a glance at Heyward)

You there. What does Munro call you?

(to Heyward)

The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies

to guide you.

WEBB

The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's

house. A company of the 33rd will accompany

you and Magua will show you the way.

HEYWARD

By your leave, sir.

WEBB

(to Adjutants)

Explain to the Major we care little about toying

with colonial militia because we have little to

fear from the French. They have not the nature

for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with

their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would

rather make love with their faces than fight.

WEBB

(continuing)

Dismissed.

HEYWARD

(to Magua)

Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See

to it you're there.

CORA

(O.S.)

Heyward! Duncan Heyward.

HEYWARD

My God it's good to see you.

CORA

I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so

long apart and after you've traveled so far ...

HEYWARD

And by sea!

CORA

You still have an aversion to the water?

HEYWARD

Aversion? No. ... "Hatred" ... "Loathing" ...

HEYWARD

But it was worth it all to end in a garden by

your side.

CORA

(difficult)

Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest

friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect

you immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings

don't go beyond that. Do you see?

HEYWARD

Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis

for a man and woman to be joined? And all

else may grow in time ...?

CORA

Some say that's the way of it.

HEYWARD

"Some"?

CORA

Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ...

HEYWARD

(interrupts)

Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined,

we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let

those whom you trust, your father, help

settle what's best for you. In view of your

indecision, why not rely on their advice and

judgment as well as mine?

HEYWARD

Will you consider that?

CORA

(pause; smiles)

Yes. Yes, I will.

ALICE

(O.S.)

Duncan!

HEYWARD

My God, you've grown up.

ALICE

We leave in the morning?!

HEYWARD

(rises)

Yes, miss.

ALICE

I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!

I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman

Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded,

red men in the wild!

CORA

My God, Alice.

HEYWARD

(smiles)

It can be dangerous ...

ALICE

Nonsense. Papa wouldn't have sent for us

if it were dangerous.

AMBROSE

(O.S. - barks)

Atten-shun!

AMBROSE

(entering)

Shoulder arms!

AMBROSE

(barks)

Form two companies of nine ... MARCH!!

and veils. The veil doesn't completely cover Alice's golden hair and blue eyes and the

traveling dress reveals that Cora, two or three years older than Alice, is fuller and more

CORA

(O.S.)

Alice, did you see that ...?

CORA

Alice?

HEYWARD

Are you alright?

ALICE

Can we rest soon?

HEYWARD

Absolutely.

HEYWARD

You there, Scout!

HEYWARD

(overly articulated)

We must ... stop ... soon. Women are ... tired.

You ... understand?

MAGUA

(perfect English)

I understand. This is not good place to stop.

Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.

That where we stop. Better place.

HEYWARD

No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the

ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you

understand?

MAGUA

(in Huron: English subtitle)

"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.

When his women want to eat, he lay aside his

tomahawk to feed their laziness."

HEYWARD

Excuse me. What did you say?

MAGUA

Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."

AMBROSE

Form company! Left face! March!

AMBROSE

Company make ready!

AMBROSE

Present!!

AMBROSE

Fire!!

AMBROSE

(continuing)

Load! Prime!

AMBROSE

(continuing)

Present! Present!

HEYWARD

Their eyes lock, each to the other's. Then ...

CORA

No, Duncan!

HAWKEYE

... case your aim is any better'n your judgment.

ALICE

(O.S.)

Stop it!

UNCAS

ALICE

We need them to get out of here!

HEYWARD

(to Nathaniel)

... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?!

UNCAS

(matter of fact)

... too easy to track ... they can be heard for

miles ... find yourself a musket ...

HAWKEYE

(to Heyward)

Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.

They'll never make a passage north.

HEYWARD

(breathless)

We were headed ...

HAWKEYE

(appropriating a knife)

... Fort William Henry.

HAWKEYE

... take you as far as the fort.

HAWKEYE

If we are goin' to take you, we need to move.

Fast ... And the fort is well off our course.

So if you all rather wait for the next Huron

war party to come by, we'll be on our way.

HEYWARD

How far is it, scout?

HAWKEYE

Day and a half

(pause)

Where did you get ... the guide?

HEYWARD

Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our

Mohawk allies.

HAWKEYE

He is Huron and nothing else.

(checking the Munro girls are

not too close)

Why would he want to murder the girl?

HEYWARD

What?!

HAWKEYE

Dark haired ...

HEYWARD

Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on

her before today.

HAWKEYE

No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?

HEYWARD

Of course not!

(pause)

And how is it you were nearby?

HAWKEYE

Came across the war party, tracked 'em.

HEYWARD

Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?

HAWKEYE

No.

HEYWARD

Fort Edward, then?

HAWKEYE

No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.

HEYWARD

I thought all our colonial scouts were in

the militia?

HAWKEYE

I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn

militia.

HEYWARD

(stops)

Then you are one of those who would allow

England to fight alone while she protects

you from France?

HAWKEYE

England does not protect me and does not

war against France on our account. She uses

us to war against France on her own account ...

of greed for land and furs.

HAWKEYE

(turns)

Clear it up any?

HEYWARD

(loud)

I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!

HAWKEYE

(low)

Do not let gratitude get in the way ...

CHINGACHGOOK

(to Hawkeye)

Yengeese no good in woods. Make more

noise, I kill him.

HEYWARD

(O.S.)

Anything to be done?

UNCAS

All dead ...

HEYWARD

Who were these people?

HAWKEYE

(re: print)

Ottawa!

HEYWARD

Excuse me ...

CHINGACHGOOK

(to Hawkeye)

Ottawa.

UNCAS

Mirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside.

HAWKEYE

(to Chingachgook)

Movin' fast, not able to carry much ...

this was a war party?

HEYWARD

Let us look after them ...

CHINGACHGOOK

Leave them.

CORA

(hasn't moved)

Though they are strangers, they are at

least entitled to a Christian burial!

HAWKEYE

(shaking his head)

Let us go, miss.

CORA

I will not. I have seen the face of war

before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on

women and children. And almost as

cruel is your indifference.

HAWKEYE

(contained)

Miss Munro.

(pause)

They are not strangers ....

And they stay as they lay ...!

CORA

Why didn't you bury those people?

HAWKEYE

Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would

see it as a sign of our passing ...

CORA

You knew them.

CORA

(stiffly)

You were acting for our benefit. And I

apologize. I misunderstood you.

HAWKEYE

Well that is to be expected. My father ...

CORA

Your "father"?

HAWKEYE

Chingachgook. He warned me about

people like you.

CORA

He did?

HAWKEYE

Yes. He said ... "do not try to make them

understand you."

CORA

What?!

HAWKEYE

Yes. And "do not try to understand them.

That is because they are a breed apart and

they make no sense ..."

CORA

(quietly)

Why did they turn back?

CORA

(still pissed off)

"We're a breed apart and we make no

sense" ...?

HAWKEYE

(smiles)

In your particular case, miss, I would

make some allowance ...

CORA

(sarcastic)

Thank you so much.

CORA

You called Chingachgook your "father"?

Where is your real family?

HAWKEYE

They buried my ma & pa and my sisters.

And Chingachgook - who found me with

two French trappers - raised me up as his

own.

CORA

I'm sorry.

HAWKEYE

I do not remember them. I was one or two.

CORA

How did you learn English?

HAWKEYE

My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend

Wheelock's school when I was ten. So

we would know both worlds ... though

we were told only bother learning readin' &

arithmetic from yous.

CORA

And what were the consequentialities of

European culture you didn't bother with?

HAWKEYE

The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas

about the government of men. My father's

people already know each man is his own

nation. And only he can have dominion

over himself. Not kings. No man is better

than any other man.

CORA

In London those radical ideas could land

you in Newgate prison.

(changing the subject)

Why were those people living in this

defenseless place ...?

HAWKEYE

'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable

to poor people. So after seven years

indentured service in Virginia, they headed

out here where they are beholden to none

and not livin' by another's leave ...

Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.

HAWKEYE

(continuing; looking up)

My father's people say ... at the birth of the

sun and of his brother, the moon, their

mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth

her body, from which was to spring all life.

And he drew forth from her breast the stars.

The stars he threw into the night sky to

remind him of her soul.

(the sky)

So there is the Camerons' monument ...

my folks', too, I guess.

CORA

(low)

You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not

understand what is happening here.

And it is not as I imagined it would be,

thinking of it in Boston and London ...

HAWKEYE

Sorry to disappoint you ...

CORA

(eyes downcast)

On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ...

to my blood ...

(then up into his eyes)

... than any imagining could possibly have

been ...

CORA

Much further?

HAWKEYE

Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are

downhill of it.

ALICE

Will we be able to bathe?

CORA

Thunder ... Papa will arrange something.

HEYWARD

The men of the regiment will fetch water from

the lake, build fires and provide every comfort

you desire, Alice ...

ALICE

Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora

doesn't marry you, I shall.

CORA

Alice!

ALICE

I can't wait to see Papa ...

CORA

And you, Duncan? What are you looking

forward to?

HEYWARD

Posting to a different continent.

CORA

I think it's very important and exciting.

CORA

Lightning?

HEYWARD

I'm Major Duncan Heyward!

BEAMS

Captain Jeffrey Beams. We didn't think

you'd make it through!

HEYWARD

Where's Colonel Munro? His daughters are

here, too.

AD LIBS

(shouts over roar)

Uncas! Nathaniel ...

IAN

Thought you and Nathaniel weren't

joinin'-up.

UNCAS

(on the run)

Didn't!

HAWKEYE

Dropped in to see how you boys is doin'.

ALICE

(hysterical)

Papa, Papa!!

MUNRO

(enraged)

Why are you here?!

MUNRO

(to Heyward; re: Alice & Cora)

Why did you allow them to come? ... And

where the bloody hell are my reinforcements!!

MUNRO

(embracing his daughters; softer)

Told you to stay away from this hell hole!

Why did you disobey me?

CORA

When? How?

MUNRO

My letter ...

CORA

There was none!

MUNRO

What?

CORA

There was no letter.

MUNRO

I sent three men to Webb!

HEYWARD

One called Magua arrived.

CORA

He delivered no such message.

MUNRO

Does Webb not even know we are besieged?

HEYWARD

Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does

not know to send reinforcements!

MUNRO

(flat)

What happened to you?

HEYWARD

(suddenly tired)

Ambush ... on the George Road. This

Magua led us into it.

(pause)

... eighteen killed. It's these men who

saved us. They guided us here ...

MUNRO

Thank you. How can I reward you?

HAWKEYE

Help ourselves to a few horns from your

powder stores.

MUNRO

What else?

UNCAS

Some food.

MUNRO

(to Uncas)

I'm indebted to you. And get your side sewn up,

young man.

MUNRO

(bellows)

Mr. Phelps!

PHELPS

Miss Cora! How are you?

CORA

(smiles)

Fine, Mr. Phelps. Have you cat gut and a

suturing needle?

(for Uncas)

And we could use some rum, clothes, and

a place to wash ...

MUNRO

(to Heyward over table map)

What a place for them ...

HEYWARD

Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given

that I've seen of the French engineering from

the ridge above?

MUNRO

(perfunctory)

Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine

and he has more of them. They keep our heads

down while his sappers make thirty yards of

trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a

two hundred yard range, so when they're close

enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive

rounds over our walls and pound us to dust.

HEYWARD

They look to be three hundred yards out.

You have three days.

MUNRO

Bloody murderers.

HAWKEYE

A man, here, can make a run straight through

to Webb.

MUNRO

... not enough time to get to Albany and back

with reinforcements ...

HEYWARD

Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to

Fort Edward two days ago.

MUNRO

Webb's at Edward?

HEYWARD

Yes, sir.

MUNRO

Only twelve miles away! He could be here day

after tomorrow.

(to Hawkeye)

Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you

the message.

HAWKEYE

John Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last

night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And

it was Ottawa. They're allied to the French.

MUNRO

Yes, Mr. Poe? So?

HAWKEYE

It was a war party. It means they're on the

attack up and down the frontier.

MUNRO

(cold)

Thank you.

HAWKEYE

Many men here, their homes are in the path.

MUNRO

That's all, sir.

HEYWARD

Things were done. Nobody was spared ...

MUNRO

Terrible feature of war in the Americas.

(beat; a mantra)

Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.

Our duty is to defeat France. That hangs

on a courier to Webb.

SENECA CHIEF

(low)

... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left

us no time to put our cabins in order before telling

us our French father had need of our aid. We rolled

our blankets and were the first to be here. Yet we

are not the first and closest to my father's campfire.

MONTCALM

(to Seneca Chief)

For my children and the children of the true

faith, my friendship and esteem is boundless ...

I will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow

I, myself, will sing the war song with you in the

great council house.

MONTCALM

Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your

English friends?

MONTCALM

(over his shoulder)

Louis Antoine, join us.

MONTCALM

Hear what le Subtil has to tell us ...

MAGUA

English war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward

with 33rd Regiment. He does not know my

father's army attacks Fort William Henry.

BOUGAINVILLE

But by now Munro knows his couriers didn't

get through. He'll send another.

MAGUA

The Grey Hair will try.

BOUGAINVILLE

Four or five, including two women entered the

fort ...

MAGUA

The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's

knife but escaped. They'll be under it again.

MONTCALM

Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?

MAGUA

When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat

his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his

children under the knife so the Grey Hair will

see his seed is wiped out forever.

MONTCALM

My sappeurs are advancing the trenches through

the night, now. You may have your opportunity

soon.

HAWKEYE (O.S.)

She know what she's doin'?

launderess dress/blouse ... She looks different. He's a little indignant.

PHELPS

First assisted me in Austria when she was

fourteen. I would say she does ...

HAWKEYE

She does not shy away from much ...

PHELPS

(elsewhere)

What's that?

HAWKEYE

Nothin'.

PHELPS (O.S.)

Miss Cora? Gentleman looking for you.

CORA

(looks up)

Mr Poe?

HAWKEYE

Miss.

(re: cotton)

May I?

HAWKEYE

(to Uncas)

You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro?

CORA

What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?

HAWKEYE

Why, I am looking at you, Miss.

Killdeer. He charges it once, then overloads the powder by a quarter charge.

UNCAS

You told him about the raid?

HAWKEYE

(nods)

He does not want to hear it.

(pause)

But he is gonna have to.

JACK

(to one man)

Get together by the West Battery James & Ian,

Sharitarish & William.

UNCAS

Tight weave.

HAWKEYE

Another forty yards?

HEYWARD

Sergeant! Form three ranks!

SERGEANT MAJOR

Sir!

(bellows to troops)

Upon the center, wheel to the left-about!

March!

(three motions; drums)

Rear ranks, proper distance!

(the rear ranks back up six paces)

Front ranks, take your distance! March!

(everybody moves)

Halt!

(in unison they slam to a stop)

Make ready!

(muskets snap to port arms)

SERGEANT MAJOR

(dead cool)

First rank! Second rank! Present arms!

(muskets shouldered)

HEYWARD

Fire!!!

HEYWARD

Advance, Sergeant Major!

SERGEANT MAJOR

Sir!!!

(to soldiers)

Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!

SERGEANT MAJOR

Shoulder arms!

(slam)

Present!

(slam)

HEYWARD

Fire!!!

HEYWARD

Sergeant Major!

SERGEANT MAJOR

Sir!

HEYWARD

Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.

SERGEANT MAJOR

Atten-hut!

HEYWARD

Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll

come back another time ...

CORA

Alice ...

ALICE

Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ...

I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.

(starts

for door)

I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ...

HEYWARD

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ...

CORA

Her nerves are shattered. She's trying

to be brave.

HEYWARD

Cora, I adore you and, when we come together,

we will be the happiest couple in England ...

I am certain of that. More than ever before.

(softens)

I believe you must trust the judgment of others

who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ...

CORA

Duncan ...

(pause)

Duncan, I promised you an answer. You

have complimented me with your persistence

and patience ... But the decision I've come

to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes

than surrender my own judgment.

CORA

And it's been unfair to you, while I search

myself for feelings, which, if they were

there and as strong as they ought to be,

would've made themselves known long ago ...

(pause)

Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan.

And please take this as my final answer.

It must be no.

HEYWARD

I see ...

CORA

I am sorry, Duncan ...

HAWKEYE (O.S.)

... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. The

cabin was attacked by a war party. They are

sweeping south down the frontier spreading

terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos

all the men are here.

IAN (O.S.)

And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of

Cameron's!

MUNRO

(to Jack)

I must receive proof more conclusive than

Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our

defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.

JACK

Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken

together, that's gospel. Your fort will	 stand

or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements,

not these colonials' presence.

MUNRO

I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not

you.

HAWKEYE

That judgment is not more important than their

right under agreement with Webb to defend their

farms & families ... Major Heyward was at John

Cameron's. He saw what it was.

MUNRO

(looking to Heyward for

confirmation of his point of view)

What did you see, Major?

HEYWARD

(to Munro)

I saw nothing that would lead me to the

conclusion it was other than a raid by savages

bent on thievery.

HAWKEYE

You're a liar!

HAWKEYE

And the blood is on your hands!

MUNRO

(to Heyward)

I'll have none of that!

(to colonials)

Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman.

Not a butcher.

HAWKEYE

Easy for you to suppose. While it is their

women and children, not yours, alone in

their farms!

MUNRO

(exploding)

You forget yourself!

JACK

We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!

MUNRO

British promises are honored. And the militia

will not be released. Because I need more

definite proof than this man's word!

JACK

Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a

long time before you got here!

MUNRO

This interview's over! The militia stays!

JACK

(to Munro)

Does the rule of English law no longer govern?

Has it been replaced by absolutism?

HAWKEYE

And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe

these people would do better makin' a peace

with the French!

HEYWARD

That is sedition! Treason!

HAWKEYE

That is the truth!

HEYWARD

(restaining himself)

I ought to have you whipped from this fort!

HAWKEYE

Major!

(changes down)

Some day I think you and I are gonna have

a serious disagreement.

MUNRO

(steel)

Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving

Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition.

Anyone leaving will be shot for desertion.

(pause)

My decision is final. Get out.

because of the policies of cold and distant European monarchs.

HAWKEYE

(low)

... got no kin in the settlements. If I did,

I'd be long gone.

IAN

You didn't think it right to be here in the

first place.

HAWKEYE

By my light that's how I saw it then and I

see it that way now ...

IAN

(low)

But we are under English military authority.

JACK

(low)

I believe if they set aside their law as and when

they wish, their law no longer has rightful

authority over us. All they have over us is

tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.

No force on earth will keep me here ... Anyone

caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each

man make your own decision ... Those who

are goin', be back here in an hour.

HAWKEYE

Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east

side of the swamp until you clear the French

picket line. Head north over the ridge, then

come about southeast and fork left in Little

Meadow and you're free of the outpost and

skirmishers ...

A COLONIAL

(grumbles)

Should've skinned outta this long ago.

COLONIAL #2

Got no families, Captain. Figured we'd stay

and give 'em a hand even though ...

HAWKEYE

(to Colonial #2)

I'll cover them from the top of the casement.

JACK

(in amazement)

You're not coming with us?

HAWKEYE

Got a reason to stay.

JACK

That reason wear a blue dress and work

in the surgery?

HAWKEYE

(dry)

It does and it is a better lookin' reason

than you, Jack Winthrop.

(more laughs)

Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French

outpost by dawn.

(sticks out his hand and

grasps Winthrop's)

Good luck, Jack.

Someone catches his eye and he moves in that direction ...

SERGEANT (O.S.)

You! Halt!

SERGEANT

As you were!!

SERGEANT

Take him!

CHINGACHGOOK

(Mohican; subtitled)

Why do they make my son prisoner?

HAWKEYE

(Mohican; subtitled)

I helped Winthrop and the others leave ...

This fight is not yours, father. I love

you and my brother. And you should leave

this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee ...

CHINGACHGOOK

(Mohican; subtitled)

What will they do with my white son?

GUARD

Get back from him!

CORA

He saved us! We are alive only because

of him ...

MUNRO

The man encouraged the colonials to desert

in this very room, in my presence. He is

guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged

like any other criminal, regardless of what he

did for my children.

CORA

He knew the consequences. And he stayed.

Are those the actions of a criminal?

... Duncan, do something.

HEYWARD

He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.

He ought to pay without sending you to beg.

CORA

You know he wouldn't send me ...! You

misrepresented what you saw and caused

this.

(frustrated)

I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ...

MUNRO

Not with enough certainty to outweigh British

interests in this fort.

HEYWARD

And who empowered these provincials to pass

judgment upon England's policies in her own

colonies? To come and go without so much as

a "by your leave."

CORA

They do not live their lives "by your leave."

... They hack it out of the wilderness with

their own two hands, burying their dead and

their children along the way.

HEYWARD

(distant)

You are defending him because you've become

infatuated with him.

CORA

Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable

qualities. But taken as a whole, I was wrong

to have thought so highly of you.

MUNRO

But the man is guilty of sedition and subject

to military justice and beyond pardon.

CORA

"Justice"? If that's "justice" ..., then the

sooner French guns blow the English army

out of America, the better it will be for

these people.

MUNRO

You do not know what you are saying!

CORA

(explodes)

Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.

And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of

sedition, too!

HAWKEYE

Sorry ... can't ask you in.

CORA

They're going to hang you.

(pause; soft)

Why didn't you leave when you had the

chance?

HAWKEYE

Because what I am interested in is right

here ...

CORA

What would you have me do?

HAWKEYE

Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.

If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If

that happens, stay close to your father.

The French will protect the officer class

among the English.

CORA

No. I will find you.

HAWKEYE

Do not.

(pause)

Promise me.

CORA

The whole world's on fire, isn't it?

HAWKEYE

This part of it sure is ...

CORA

What is it?

HAWKEYE

I don't know. Whatever happens you stay

with your father. You stay among the officers.

MONTCALM

Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant

antagonist. I am happy to make your

acquaintance as a friend.

MUNRO

And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.

MONTCALM

Please accept my compliments for the strong

and skillful defense of your fortress. Under

the command of a lesser man it would have

fallen long ago given the superior numbers and

material ... mere chance has allowed me to

array against you ...

MUNRO

Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a

diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.

MONTCALM

You have already done everything which is

necessary for the honor of your Prince. I

will forever bear testimony that your resistance

has been gallant and was continued as long as

there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen

to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to

consider my terms for your surrender.

MUNRO

However I may apprise such testimony from

Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is

strong and stands.

MONTCALM

Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may

be refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to

us every opportunity to reconnoiter your

works and I am possibly as well acquainted

with your weak condition as you are yourselves.

MUNRO

Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the

Hudson and he knows the size and imminence

of the army of Webb ...?

MONTCALM

(quietly)

My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended

for you.

MONTCALM

(to Bougainville)

Read the dispatch.

BOUGAINVILLE

(O.S. - reading)

"Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have

no men available to send to your rescue. It is

impossible. I  advise you to seek terms for

surrender. Signed Webb."

HEYWARD

(confirming)

This is the signature of Webb.

(to Munro)

And I know the temper of our men. Rather

than spend the war in a French prison hulk

in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.

MUNRO

(to Montcalm)

You have heard your answer, Monsieur le

Marquis.

(salutes)

MONTCALM

Sir.

(challengingly)

I am incapable of mistreating brave men.

I beg you not to sign the death warrant

of so many until you have listened to my

terms.

MUNRO

Such as ...?

MONTCALM

My master requires the fort be destroyed.

But, for you and your comrades, there is

no privilege that will be denied. None of

your men will see the inside of a prison

barge. They're free to go so long as they

return to England and fight no more on this

continent, and the civilian militia return to

their farms.

MUNRO

Their arms?

MONTCALM

They may leave the fortress fully armed, but

with no ammunition ... Other than that, ask

what you wish.

MUNRO

The honors of war?

MONTCALM

Granted.

MUNRO

My colors?

MONTCALM

Carry them to England to your King with pride.

MUNRO

Allow me to consult with my officers.

MUNRO

I have lived to see two things I never expected.

An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And

a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.

HEYWARD

General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back

and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our

mission is to fight.

MUNRO

(flares)

Death and honor are sometimes thought to be

the same. Today I have learned that they are not.

HEYWARD

Sir!

MUNRO

(stops him with his eyes)

The decision is final.

MUNRO

I am deeply touched by such unusual and

unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours

under the condition that we be given until

dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and

women for their march and turn our wounded

over to your surgeon.

MONTCALM

Granted, Monsieur.

SENTRY

Qui vive?

MONTCALM

France.

SENTRY

Le mot d'ordre?

MONTCALM

La victoire.

SENTRY

C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin,

monsieur!

MONTCALM

Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.

MAGUA

Is the hatchet buried between the English

and my French father?

MONTCALM

Yes.

MAGUA

Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men

become friends.

MONTCALM

My master owns these lands and your father

has been ordered to drive off the English

squatters. They have consented to go. So

now he calls them enemies no longer.

MAGUA

Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.

It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will

be buried.

MONTCALM

But so many suns have set since Le Renard

struck the war post. Is he not tired?

MAGUA

Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.

It is dark and cold. It has set on his people,

they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell

all of their lands to enrich the European masters

who are always greedy for more than they need.

(threatening)

And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have

been many clouds and many mountains. But now

he has come to lead his nation.

MONTCALM

That Le Renard has the power to lead his people

into the light, I know well.

MAGUA

Does my father know that?

MONTCALM

That's where a lead bullet has torn you.

MAGUA

And this?

MONTCALM

My son has been sadly injured. Who did

this?

MAGUA

(laughs; sardonic)

Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.

And the sticks left their mark ...

(pause; for real)

Magua's village and lodges were burnt.

Magua's children were killed by the English.

Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks

who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife

believed he was dead and became the wife of

another. The Grey Hair was the father of all

this.

(pause)

In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk

to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.

And his heart will be whole again on the day

when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!

MONTCALM

My son Magua's pain is my pain.

MAGUA

Does the chief of the Canadas believe the

English will keep the terms?

MONTCALM

Munro would. But General Webb will not

send their soldiers across the salt lake.

Having let them go, I fear I will only fight

the same men again when I move south.

(pause; shrugs)

And yet, I cannot break the terms of the

capitulation and sully the lilies of France ...

MAGUA

Many things my French father cannot do,

Magua can.

MONTCALM

As the English march away, our soldiers

and the Canadiens will be drawn to the

looting of the fort ... except for a small

guard ...

MAGUA

(in Iroquois; re: Montcalm)

I wonder at the blindness and pride of the

white man. He believes only he knows

how to speak falsely to make other men do

his bidding.

MUNRO

(eyes forward)

Monsieur, the fort is yours.

MUNRO

Steady! No one fires!

HEYWARD

(to Sergeant Major)

Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!

SERGEANT MAJOR

Yes sir!

MUNRO

Do not break ranks! I want these ranks

to hold ...!

SERGEANT MAJOR

Right - about face! March! First rank present!

HEYWARD

Fire!

SERGEANT MAJOR

Prime! Load! Second rank six paces forward!

Present!

HEYWARD

Fire!

HAWKEYE

Cora!

MUNRO

Cora! Alice!

HEYWARD

Second rank fire! Six paces back! Prime!

Load! Third rank! Present!

MAGUA

Grey Hair. I will cut your heart from your

living chest in front of your eyes. As you die,

know that I will put under the knife your

children and wipe your seed from this earth

forever ...

HEYWARD

Six paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two,

present! Rank two, hold!

HEYWARD

Rank two, six paces back! Rank one,

present!

with bayonets and tomahawks.

CORA

No!

HAWKEYE

You got nothin' better to do today on

Lake George than shoot me, Major,

then go ahead ...

CORA

Stop it!!

HEYWARD

When you fall into British hands again,

Nathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged.

REDCOAT #1

Can't ... keep it up ...

HAWKEYE

Pull!

HEYWARD

(shouts)

How long?

HAWKEYE

(shouts)

Only chance we got is ...

(breathless)

... to get more distance on 'em and go

to ground!

HAWKEYE

(shouts)

Pull!!

HAWKEYE

Pull ...!

REDCOAT #2

Spent.

HAWKEYE

(to Heyward)

Head for ... for the white water.

HEYWARD

Do you hear me, sir!

(exhausted)

If you ever fall ... into British hands ...

(breathes)

What white water?

HAWKEYE

Here's where it gets tricky ...

HAWKEYE

Don't move ...

HEYWARD

Where do we go from here?

HAWKEYE

We don't.

HEYWARD

I don't understand!

HAWKEYE

This is it, as far as we can go ... If we're

lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have

come this way and must've beached our

canoes and headed cross land. If we're

very lucky, they'll figure we went over

the falls.

HEYWARD

Then what?

HAWKEYE

Then we take the south rim down the

mountain and it's 12 miles cross country

to Fort Edward.

HEYWARD

And if we're unlucky?

HAWKEYE

You will have to forego the pleasure of

hangin' me.

HEYWARD

Any powder?

HAWKEYE:

(crossing to Cora)

Only one or two loads.

CORA

Are we safe?

HAWKEYE

Maybe ...

CORA

Our father? Did you see my father?

CORA

Tell me!

CORA

Say nothing to Alice ...!

ALICE

Uncas ...

CORA

Yes. Go ahead.

HEYWARD

(explodes)

What the bloody hell plan is this?

HAWKEYE

(to Cora)

In this there is a chance. If I live, I can

try to free you. If we don't go, there is

no powder, there's too many of them.

Though my heart would keep me here,

in that there is no chance. None. I can do

nothing. Do you understand?

CORA

Yes. I want you to go.

HEYWARD

Coward! Coward back at the fort.

Coward here.

CORA

You try. With all you have. To save

yourself. If the worst happens, and

only one of us survives, something of

the other does, too ...

HAWKEYE

(very close)

If they don't kill you, they may take you

north up into Canada. A warrior may take

you for a wife.

HAWKEYE

(continues)

Listen. Submit. You hear me? You're

strong. You stay alive. I will find you ...

no matter how far, how long it takes ...

CORA

(nods, low)

... never doubt what you are doing.

HEYWARD

If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers

... will receive many gifts.

MAGUA

(as if considering)

Gifts?

HEYWARD

Three, four oxen ... much wampum.

MAGUA

Wampum?

HEYWARD

Yes.

MAGUA

Does Yengeese Major have property

across salt sea?

HEYWARD

Yes.

MAGUA

Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.

Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum,

many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.

HEYWARD

Gold could be arranged.

MAGUA

For Munro children?

HEYWARD

Yes.

MAGUA

How much gold has the master of the

Yengeese?

HEYWARD

The King? The King has mountains of

gold!

MAGUA

Not enough.

HEYWARD

What is enough?

MAGUA

Heart. Give Magua new heart.

SACHEM

(in Huron; subtitled)

The tomahawks of your young men have

been very red.

MAGUA

(in Huron; subtitled)

Many of the Yengeese are dead, great

Sachem.

(sound dissolve to English)

I have brought three of my prisoners,

to honor you. Two are the children

of Munro. Whose scalp hangs on my

lodge pole. And whose heart I cut from

his chest.

MAGUA

... the earth was pale. Our tomahawks

were bright. Now they are dull from war.

And the Huron rich with the trophies of

honor ... Magua will sell the English

officer to Les Francais and the reward is

my gift to you, wise one ... The women -

children of the white war chief - will burn

in our fires so all can share in this.

CORA

Nathaniel!

HAWKEYE

(to Heyward; low)

Translate for me, Major. Into French.

Every word ... as I say it.

HAWKEYE

(to Sachem)

I come to you unarmed and in peace to

unstop your ears, wise one. Because the

Hurons are mislead by the words of the

wolf who's never spoken the truth.

HAWKEYE

Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro

go free and take the fire out of the English

anger over the murder of their helpless ones.

MAGUA

(to Sachem)

Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the

Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron

do not fear English anger.

HAWKEYE

(to Sachem)

Wise one, the French fathers made peace

and swore to their honor not to break the

friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that

the French would not be friends, still, to

the Huron.

MAGUA

(laughs)

It made our French father happy to never

have to fight the same Yengeese again.

He told me this without telling me this.

HAWKEYE

So the Huron are the servants of the French?

To do what the French are shamed to do?

MAGUA

No.

(to Sachem)

Huron serve no one. The French father

believes he fooled Magua because he is so

proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it

is the Huron path that Magua walks down,

not the French one ... Now, Les Francais,

also, fear Huron. That is good. When the

Huron is strong from their fear, we will make

the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we

will trade as the white man trades. Take land

from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk

& Fox. And make the Huron great. Over

other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong

as the whites.

HAWKEYE

(to Sachem)

Magua would use the ways of Les Francais

and the Yengeese ...

MAGUA

(to Sachem)

The red man put down the bow, picked up

the fire stick and became the best warrior

in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.

HAWKEYE

Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers

foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell

them for gold to the white man? Would the

Huron have greed for more land than a man

can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?

Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would

the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the

animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But

sell the fur to the white man for gold? ...

(to Sachem)

Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les

Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron

men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?

... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make

himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become

Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?

... Magua's way is false. It is like the white

sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness

and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.

(pauses)

I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye,

adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican

people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go

free ... I speak the truth.

SACHEM

The white man comes like a day that has

passed. And night enters our future with

him ...

(pause)

Our council talks since I was a boy:

What is the Huron to do?

(pause)

But Magua would lead Huron down paths

that make us not Hurons.

(the judgment)

Dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted

heart of Magua.

SACHEM

(continuing)

Munro daughter with moon in her hair

must be Magua's wife so Munro's seed

doesn't die.

SACHEM

(continuing; dissolves

back to French)

... and Yengeese officer not go to Les

Francais, but back to Yengeese so their

hatred burns less bright. La Longue Carabine,

go in peace.

HAWKEYE

No! listen.

(to Heyward)

Tell him I'll trade him! Me for her! Tell him!!

HAWKEYE

(shouts)

I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a

great honor to the Huron. Take me!

MAGUA

(French; subtitled)

This is not the voice of wisdom. I go to

the Hurons of the Lakes! You are women.

Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca,

beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind.

Slaves, dogs, rabbits, thieves ... I spit on you!

HAWKEYE

I said to trade me!

HEYWARD

... compliments, Mr. Poe.

(pause)

Take her and get out.

CORA

(standing)

What are they doing to Duncan?

Duncan!

HAWKEYE

(low to himself)

And my compliments to you ...

CORA

Alice?

breaking Magua's right arm. And ...

CHINGACHGOOK

UNCAS!!!

CHINGACHGOOK

(Mohican)

Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life ...

CHINGACHGOOK/

HAWKEYE (V.O.):

(in English)

... a warrior goes to you swift and straight

as an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him

and let him take his place at the council fire

of my people.

(pause)

He is Uncas, my son.

(pause)

Bid them patience and ask death for speed;

for they are all there but one

- I, Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans.

HAWKEYE

Will you go back to England?

CORA

I have nothing to go back for.

HAWKEYE

Then will you stay in America?

HAWKEYE

And will you be my wife?

CORA

Yes.

CORA

Where will we go?

HAWKEYE

Winter with the Delaware, my father's

cousins. And in the spring, cross the

Ohio and look for land to settle with my

father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.

CHINGACHGOOK

The frontier moves with the sun and pushes

the red man of the wilderness forests in front

of it. Until one day there will be nowhere left.

Then our race will be no more, or be not us ...

The frontier place is for people like my white

son and his woman and their children.

HAWKEYE

That's my father's sadness talking.

CHINGACHGOOK

No. It is true ... One day ... there will be no

more frontier. Then men like you will go, too.

Like the Mohicans.

(pause)

And new people will come. Work. Struggle

to make their light ... One mystery remains.

HAWKEYE

What is that?

CHINGACHGOOK

Will there be anything left to show the world

that we ever did exist?

THE END
