CAPTAIN

A variation on our squid ink

risotto.  Trace of Moselle, to

sweeten the stock.

CAPTAIN

Don't kill us on this one, it's

a long shot.

JULIANNE

I'm writing it up as inventive and

confident.  Which it is.  Off the

record, I'll need an extra boat of

the ink.  Or a salt shaker.

CAPTAIN

I'll toss a coin.

DIGGER

Is it ever embarrassing, having

your bum kissed in public?

JULIANNE

If your ass isn't chapped, you

are not a good-writer of note.

JULIANNE

Is it sad to be an editor, and bask

only in reflected insincerity?

DIGGER

I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.

JULIANNE

See the pull of a book like

Twenty Chefs, is not who I

put in.  It's who I leave out.

DIGGER

Which is everyone you couldn't

get in.

JULIANNE

Plus some guys whose food I don't

like.

DIGGER

This fellow from Newsday ever

call?

JULIANNE

I'll buzz my machine.  Inventive

and confident, yeh?

DIGGER

Needs salt.

JULIANNE

Is Newsday a real interview, or

just some cute guy you're setting

me up w...

DIGGER

... I don't send you men, anymore.

You don't know what to do with them.

JULIANNE

Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.

DIGGER

... weeks.

MAN'S VOICE (V.O., soft)

Hey.  It's Michael.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

God, it must be, what, months, huh?

I can't wait to talk to you.  I'm

in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton...

MICHAEL (V.O.)

Call me four in the morning,

whatever, we gotta talk.

DIGGER

Who called? The man of the

moment?

JULIANNE

No, no, the opposite.  That's

my best friend, Michael O'Neal.

He sounds desperate to talk.

DIGGER

The wandering sportswriter.

DIGGER

I didn't know you two had a

past.

DIGGER

The look in your eye.

JULIANNE

Sophomore year at Yale we had

this one hot month.  And, you

know me, I got restless...

JULIANNE

So I get up the nerve to break

his heart.  I tell him there's

this dreamy exchange student

from Pakistan who wants to,

you know...

JULIANNE

And he gets this... look.  He

says, "I knew I couldn't hold

your interest", which, of course,

makes me feel like the shallow

bitch I've always been...

JULIANNE

Then he says, "But what makes

me want to cry.  Is I'm losing

the best friend I ever had."

JULIANNE

And when he said it, I knew.

I felt the same.

JULIANNE

So I cried.  For maybe the third

time in my life.  And I kissed

him.  And we've been best friends

ever since.

JULIANNE

Nine years, we've seen each other

through everything.  Losing jobs,

losing parents, losing lovers...

travelled all over, we've had the

best times.  The best times of my

life, maybe.  Just drinking and

talking.  Even over a phone.

DIGGER

Kindred spirits.

JULIANNE

No, he's nothing like me.  He's

like you.  Only straight.

JULIANNE

He's the salt of the earth.  Kind

and loyal and generous.  The one

constant thing in my life, is he'll

always be there.

DIGGER

He's still in love with you.

JULIANNE

Maybe.  But it never gets in

the way.

DIGGER

Well, he has a true friend in

you.

DIGGER

Whenever George tells someone

how steadfast I am, he always

makes me sound boring.

JULIANNE

Solid and genuine is not boring.

Michael can be completely insane...

JULIANNE

There was this one night in

Tucson, like six years ago...

we got amazingly drunk, I mean,

Keith Richards time...

JULIANNE

God, I haven't thought of this

in so long...

JULIANNE

I can even believe we did

this...

JULIANNE

Could you give us a minute?

JULIANNE

You won't miss much, I promise

there was no sex.

DIGGER

I've lost interest.

JULIANNE

He takes a razor from his dinky

little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip,

takes my hand, does the same to me...

DIGGER

Blood oath.

JULIANNE

He says, "Swear.  When we're both

28, if we've never been married...

we marry each other!"

JULIANNE

See, he figured that would be a

sign from God, or someone of

comparable authority, that we'd

misunderstood our destinies.

JULIANNE

We never talked about it again.  I

don't know what made me think of...

DIGGER (quietly)

I do.

DIGGER

You'll be 28 in three weeks.

How old is he?

JULIANNE

You think...

DIGGER

Desperate.  To talk.

JULIANNE

He's not proposing marriage,

there's no way I'm buying one

word of th...

DIGGER

Then why are you compulsively

eating? If you're not hysterical?

JULIANNE

He can't do that to me!

DIGGER

We're about to find out.

JULIANNE

When I turn him down...

JULIANNE

We'll never be the same.

DIGGER

I have a suggestion...

JULIANNE

I'll have to kill myself before I

call him.

DIGGER (sadly)

That was it.

JULIANNE

This is awkward timing, Michael,

I just joined this convent, and

they never give your deposit ba...

JULIANNE

Michael, I'm married.

JULIANNE

... and I have two weeks to live.

JULIANNE

Michael, I'm trying to be gay,

don't confuse me.

JULIANNE

I was calling Michael O'Neal,

but seeing it's so late, I could

just leave a mes...

JULIANNE (soft)

Good evening, sir.  You've been

enrolled in the Obscene Call Of

The Month Club, and th...

MICHAEL (V.O.)

Hey! God, it's so good to hear

your voice.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

I've been calling for days!

JULIANNE

Yeh, well my old machine kept

eating messages.  I tried

constructively ignoring it in

hopes of improvement, but finally...

MICHAEL (V.O., urgent)

Look, I have to ask you something.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

Something so incredibly important,

that if you turn me down, I don't

know what I'll d...

JULIANNE (bright)

I just have to tell you this one

thing first, okay? I mean this

will hand you the biggest laugh

of your adult life...

JULIANNE

I was thinking about you, and I

remembered this unbelievably insane

night we spent together in Tucson,

like a thousand years ago?

JULIANNE

I mean, there's no way you could

possibly remember the...

MICHAEL (V.O., soft)

Are you kidding?

MICHAEL (V.O.)

I think about that night all

the time.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

But it's not why I called.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

I called because I met someone.

JULIANNE

Well, that's great.  You haven't

really had anybody since Dingbat

Jennylee...

MICHAEL (V.O.)

You don't understand.  I've never

felt this way about anybody!

MICHAEL (V.O.)

And she's all wrong for me!

JULIANNE

Well, somet...

MICHAEL (V.O.)

I mean she's a junior at Chicago

University, she's twenty years

old! Like when I first met you.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

And her dad is like this billionaire

who owns the White Sox and some cable

empire, and you know how I've always

been miserably awkward around those

kinda stuffed suits...

JULIANNE

Well, sure.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

But they're so down to earth, such

wonderful people...

JULIANNE

You've met her parents.

MICHAEL (V.O., quiet)

Well.  Sure.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

See.  We're getting married.

This Sunday.

JULIANNE

Michael, it's Wednesday night,

you can't possibly be getting

married on Su...

MICHAEL (V.O.)

Actually, it all starts tomorrow.

It's one of those four-day weddings,

with all the traditional events, and

ten million people flying in from

Madagascar such.

JULIANNE (incredibly lame)

Aren't you... working this weekend?

I mean, is that responsible?

MICHAEL (V.O.)

Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's

letting me do a profile on the Big

Hurt.  That's Frank...

JULIANNE

(barely audible)

... Thomas, yeh.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

Jules.  I'm scared.

JULIANNE

Well, maybe we should talk ab...

MICHAEL (V.O.)

I need you.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

If you can't come.  And hold my

hand.  I'll never get through this.

MICHAEL (V.O.)

Please come, please.

JULIANNE

W...

MICHAEL (V.O.)

I can't wait for you to meet her!

DIGGER (V.O., machine)

You've reached Digger and George.

Brevity will be appreciated.

JULIANNE (in a rage)

IT'S ME AGAIN, WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS

UP HAVING SAFE SEX??

JULIANNE

OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, WHY AREN'T

YOU INTERRUPTING IT TO ANSWER

THE PHONE??

JULIANNE

YOU, YOU, YOU! IT'S ALL ABOUT

YOU, ISN'T IT??

DIGGER

You can't get lung cancer and

die in four days.  Go to Plan B.

JULIANNE

You have no appropriate sense

of emergency.  My best friend

is ruining his life.

DIGGER

No, he's ruining yours.

JULIANNE

Same difference.  If you love

someone, it's your duty to save

them from themselves.

DIGGER

You have a real philosophy of

life.

JULIANNE

It's called the Law of Love,

asshole.

DIGGER (gently)

Why don't we have a drink? You

could catch a later fl...

JULIANNE

I'm a busy girl.  I've got four

days to break up a wedding, and

steal the bride's fella.

JULIANNE

He's adored me for nine goddamn

years.

DIGGER

I can see why.

JULIANNE

She knows him maybe five seconds,

plus she has billions of dollars,

plus she's perfect, so don't go

feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!

JULIANNE

And don't go feeling sorry for

me, you don't know me that well.

We're only friends.

DIGGER (softly)

I stand corrected.

JULIANNE

I'm making a big mistake, huh?

DIGGER (shrugs)

Maybe you'll learn something.

JULIANNE

I'm gonna bring him back, man.

Against all odds, y'know.  Cos

if I don't...

JULIANNE

... I gotta live with it forever.

JULIANNE

And at my wedding.  I'll be the

only bride with her own best man.

MICHAEL (murmurs)

Can you believe it? Can you believe

I'm actually gonna do this?

JULIANNE (lost in his eyes)

Not hardly.

KIMMY

This just makes everything so

perfect.

KIMMY

All I've heard, from the day I

met Michael, is Julianne this,

and Julianne that...

JULIANNE

Well, we're...

KIMMY

I think the best part of marrying

this guy is finding you.

KIMMY

I've never had a sister.

KIMMY

My heart's in my throat, here.

Right off, I have to ask this

monstrous favor...

JULIANNE

You need a few dollars.

KIMMY

Dry.  Just like he said.

JULIANNE

Excuse me?

KIMMY

I can be quick.  I can even

be funny.

KIMMY

But I can't be dry.

JULIANNE

Can you watch the road?

KIMMY

See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.

KIMMY

This is a very presumptuous

and burdensome fav...

JULIANNE

... you want a menage on your

wedding night.

KIMMY (straight back)

No, that wouldn't be burdensome.

KIMMY

My classmate Angelique shattered

her pelvis line dancing in

Abeline on Spring Break.

KIMMY

Be my maid of honor.

KIMMY

You can't believe what it'd

cost to bring in a temp.

JULIANNE

Uh.  How about promoting a

bridesmaid?  Someone you know

for at least forty-five minutes.

KIMMY

The bridesmaids are my only two

female relatives under forty.

Identical twin debutantes from

Nashville, who are basically

vengeful sluts.  With amazing

bodies!

JULIANNE

Which was the disqualifying

factor?

KIMMY

The twin part.  I like to remain

impartial in my contempt.

KIMMY

This means I have four days

to make you my new best friend...

KIMMY

And since I already know everything

about you.  Including intimate

facts I'm mortified to have heard,

but too envious to forget.  It's

time for you to learn about me...

KIMMY

Force yourself.  To get personal.

JULIANNE (smiles)

Sounds like a plan.

KIMMY

If you'd rather the lilac...

JULIANNE

I thought bridesmaids had to wear

the same dress.

KIMMY

Not you.  You won't be comfortable

unless you're distinctive.

JULIANNE

What else did he tell you...

KIMMY

... you hate weddings, you never go.

KIMMY

You're not up for anything

conventional, or popularly

assumed to be female priorities.

Including marriage.  Or romance.

Or even...

JULIANNE (quietly)

... not even love.

JULIANNE

That's why Michael and I were

the wrong fit.  Right from the

start.

KIMMY

He said that, too.

KIMMY

Well, I thought I was like you.

And proud to be.  Until I met

rumpled, smelly old Michael...

KIMMY

And then I found I was just a

sentimental schmuck.  Like all

those flighty nitwits I'd always

pitied.

KIMMY

Funny world, huh?

JULIANNE

I need a smoke.

KIMMY

It's mostly the seam.  Let's

get this to Carlos.

KIMMY (firm)

Just.  Don't.  Move.

JULIANNE

Don't you have to be somewh...

KIMMY

... just my bridal shower.  And

Michael has to meet our dads and

the groomsmen at Comiskey for a

one-thirty game.

KIMMY

Other than that...

JULIANNE

Come in, and shut the...

JULIANNE

... door.

MICHAEL (laughing)

Should I turn around, or someth...

JULIANNE

Michael, I'm in my underwear!

MICHAEL

We've seen each other a lot

more naked than this.

MICHAEL

I mean, we were skinny-dipping

in Greece, just as pals, less

than two years ago.

JULIANNE

Things are different now.

MICHAEL (softly)

Well.  I leave with two thoughts

in my mind.

MICHAEL (even softer)

You're still a very pretty

girl.

JULIANNE

What's the sec...

MICHAEL

Mirrors.

JULIANNE

... luckiest guy in the Northern

Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...

KIMMY

What? Because I'm a little

understand...

JULIANNE

... most sentimental schmucks I

pity want a honeymoon after their

wedding.  Just to top it off.

KIMMY

I can't expect the NBA to hold

up the playoffs...

KIMMY

I'm excited Sports Illustrated

gave him this kind of shot, he's

only there a ye...

JULIANNE

So your honeymoon is exactly where?

KIMMY

It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps

Sacramento, we could start there.

Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana-

Clevel...

JULIANNE

... garden sports, all.  Little swing

of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit,

represents a packing challenge, but

there's fine food and cocktails at a

choice of Embassy Suit...

KIMMY

It's his career, I'm supportive.

Look, I've been everywhere, I've

seen the world, I've laid on a beach.

I want to be with the man I love.

That's what makes it a honeymoon.

JULIANNE

I'm just saying he's lucky.

JULIANNE

Takes one woman in a billion to

put up with his array of shit.

The guy is a one-man festival of

idiosync...

JULIANNE

Well.  You've been introduced

to the symphonic range of...

KIMMY

... his snoring, yeah.  He says

it's worse than ever.  That

snaffle one...?

KIMMY

Well now it has this sorta

phlegm rattle behind it...

KIMMY

Guess what? Earplugs work.

JULIANNE

How about...

KIMMY

... cigars in bed? I broke him

on that.  But the bathroom's a

swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner,

tells the same, admittedly funny,

jokes three hundred times...

KIMMY

... loves action movies, subscribes

to Playboy for godsake, reads over

my shoulder, can't keep track of

the checks he writes...

KIMMY

He sucks soup through his

front teeth.

JULIANNE

A trademark move, don't touch

it.

KIMMY

But he sure can kiss.

JULIANNE

It's been awhile.  I'll take

your word.

KIMMY

After two weeks of cataloguing

all his faults, I made a command

decision that changed my life.

KIMMY

I threw the list away.

KIMMY

He's not a balance sheet, so

many wonderful qualities, so

many faults.  He's Michael.

KIMMY

And loving him means loving

all of this.

JULIANNE

Do you get nervous in small

confined spaces?

KIMMY

So it's sweet of you to be

protective...

JULIANNE

Let me rephrase that...

KIMMY

But nothing ever could, ever

did, give me a moment's pause

about this marriage...

JULIANNE

Do you get hysterical in small

confined spa...

KIMMY

... except one.

JULIANNE

Oh, yeah?

KIMMY

You.

KIMMY

You'll always be there.  In his

mind.  The perfect creature he

loved for all those y...

JULIANNE

Well, perfection can get wearing

after whi...

KIMMY

I'm not joking.  I had to face

up to all my competitive drives,

and believe me, I've got 'em.

JULIANNE

No.

KIMMY

And the answer was so simple.

JULIANNE

I was gonna predict that.

KIMMY

You win.

KIMMY

You're enshrined in his heart

and memory.  Unassailable.

Which works out great.

JULIANNE

I've missed a step.

KIMMY

He has you on a pedestal.  And

me in his arms.

JULIANNE

Jesus, we're trapped!

KIMMY

Ju...

JULIANNE

No, this happened to me once,

almost, it was excruciating!

JULIANNE

There's a panel up there, you

could boost me...

JULIANNE

You know how little air is

in these things? I've seen

statistics! Once you're trapped

between floors...

JULIANNE

God! Then the door is jammed!

MANDY

Mah Gawd, it's the bride,

and the woman she'll nevah

live up to!

KIMMY (mutters to Julianne)

That would be us.

SAMMY

Did she say th' wrong thang

agin? It is so in character!

JULIANNE

(thrusts out her hand)

I'm Julianne Potter, and...

SAMMY

... we'd be the vengeful sluts.

We came in complementary colors.

MANDY

Have you sized up the groomsmen,

Jules?  As M. of H., you get

first fuck.  Don't pick the

short, hairy, rich one.

JULIANNE

... unless he has a hump.

KIMMY (to the sluts)

Dry.  I told you.

WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

Is this Michael's Julianne?

ISABELLE

I'm Isabelle Wallace, and my

handsome new son scarcely did

you justice, girl.

ISABELLE

Now, my husband says to scoot

you over to the ballpark, so

you can hang with Michael.  But

first, you have to meet a lot of

really old women.

ISABELLE

That is, if you've absorbed

enough profanity.

MANDY (O.S., pouting)

We sayed one fuck.

JULIANNE

Desperate measures! Do you

hear me?  Digger, are you the...

JULIANNE

I don't know, hit men, whoopee

cushions, saltpeter, something!

The girl is impossibly impregnable.

Even I want her to get the guy!!

JULIANNE

Tell him the what? The truth...??

JULIANNE

That desperate.  May I never get.

JULIANNE

Which of you gents ordered

two beers?

MICHAEL

Wow!  Lemme give you a ha...

JULIANNE (sweetly)

Michael.  You'll unwittingly

imply that I'm clumsy.

MICHAEL

Think of that.  And as well as

I know you.

BODYGUARD

Sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty.

JULIANNE (lovely smile)

It's Miss.  And thanks.  That

leaves two for me.

MICHAEL

Julianne Potter, this is Hank

and Gerry from SI, and you know

Daniel...

MICHAEL

Oh.  This is my father-in-law,

Walter.

MICHAEL

How are you doing this? You're

on drugs.

WALTER

If he gives you grief, I'll have

him skillfully beaten, where the

wounds won't show.

JULIANNE

I guess getting him whacked would

be politically out of the question.

WALTER

Under the circumstances.  Charmed

to know you, Jules.

JULIANNE

Nice meeting you, too, Walt.

MICHAEL

And, this guy, you know...

JULIANNE

Papa Joe.

JOE

You gonna be my boy's best man?

JULIANNE

Best everything, Joe.  But I'm

going to dance with you.

MICHAEL

Dance?  You don't dance!  You

learn to dance??

JULIANNE

Moves.  You've never seen.

MICHAEL

You're an impostor! What have

you done with my best friend?

MICHAEL

And how was the hot dog?

MICHAEL

Cheap and unnecessary.  We were

looking anyway.

JULIANNE

I just admire your maturity,

that's all.  I mean, there are

people who would find that kind of

perfection boring.  Day after day,

year after year...

MICHAEL

... see, that's what I thought at

first.  How can you like someone

that perfect? No potential for

long-range livability.

MICHAEL

Luckily.  The closer I watched,

the more the fault came into

focus.  Each imperfection its own

adorable slice of vulnerability.

JULIANNE

Such as.

MICHAEL

She's too genuine.

JULIANNE

Hate that.

MICHAEL

How can you trust someone you

can never mistrust?

JULIANNE

What's next?

MICHAEL

No matter how many times I

leave the toilet seat up, she

forgets and puts it down.

JULIANNE

Endearingly absent-minded.

MICHAEL

My very point.  Here's another one...

MICHAEL

Every day.  She makes the bed.

JULIANNE

Quite the little eccentric.

MICHAEL

At first, I thought it was a

gag, but she's always done it!

JULIANNE

Is there a coup de grace in

here, somewh...

MICHAEL

She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.

JULIANNE

Waiter! Check, please!

MICHAEL

She finds him "personable."

JULIANNE

Can that kind of defect be

passed on genetically?

MICHAEL

Then again.  She has a few good

traits.

JULIANNE

Gimme like, eight and nine off

the top ten list...

MICHAEL

First girl I ever knew.  Who

lets me give her a bath.

MICHAEL

And when I hug her, even in

public.  I don't have to let go

right away.  She lets me hold

her as long as I want.

MICHAEL

Nice kid, don't you think?

JULIANNE

Looks like, from here.

JULIANNE

How'd you find this pl...

KIMMY

Lived here my whole life,

never heard of it.  Until

our first date.

KIMMY

He finds all these spots,

everywhere he goes, it's a

mystical gift.

MICHAEL (shy)

Jesus, one d-back from the Bears

knows a place...

KIMMY

It's not just clubs.  This guy

always knows the best everything.

The best guitar store, the best

beef ribs, the best Horowitz record,

was he always like the...

JULIANNE

... always.  The best dim sum, the

best camping stuff...

KIMMY

Stop, we're embarrassing h...

JULIANNE

... best valley in New Zealand,

best... women's shoes...

MICHAEL

I tried those on.  When you

weren't looking.

JULIANNE

Where was that, Florence, huh?

MICHAEL

Firenze.

JULIANNE

The Vespa? Me hanging on behind

in the rain all night?

MICHAEL

Till the gas ran out.

KIMMY

I love Florence.

JULIANNE

Take her there.

JULIANNE

I mean, now.  She's perky,

she deserves a honeymoon.

JULIANNE

I heard.  If San Antone sweeps

Sacramento.  What is this shit?

You gotta get off the road by

September anyway, when does Fall

Quarter start?

KIMMY

Uh.  I'm not coming back.  For

senior year.

JULIANNE

Don't architects find a degree,

sort of... an asset?

KIMMY

Well, the school will be here.

Architecture will still be around.

Right now...

MICHAEL

I travel every week.  College

ball, motor sports, training

camps...

KIMMY

The most important thing. Is

being together.

KIMMY

I'm just a baby.  I've got all...

the time... in the world.

MICHAEL

Because I could come...

KIMMY

To the twins' soiree?  So they

can paw you and drool...?

JULIANNE (calls out, helpful)

They're gonna drool anyway!

KIMMY (to both)

Enjoy each other.

JULIANNE

Should I whistle down a cab?

MICHAEL

Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm

cheap, remember?

JULIANNE

Sometimes.  About the dumbest

things.

MICHAEL

The El's right down the street.

Unless you're afraid of the

neighborhood.

JULIANNE

No.  I'm always safe with you.

JULIANNE

Pretty amazing girl, you've got.

Make that kind of sacrifice.

MICHAEL

What, leaving school...

JULIANNE

... all of it.  She's leaving her

family, her friends, everything she

knows.  She's putting her career

on hold, and she seems a pretty

ambitious, driven, kind of pers...

MICHAEL (quietly)

In her way.

JULIANNE

All to follow you in this dumb

job, where you travel 52 weeks

a year to College Station, Texas,

and such.  It's not a job for a

grown man, Michael, Peter Pan

never married.

JULIANNE (softly)

I don't think she's naturally

the... submissive type.  Aren't you

afraid she's gonna choke on this

stand-by-your-man shit after awhi...

MICHAEL (real quiet)

No.

JULIANNE

I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable

sports... most girls in her spot would

be angling to get Daddy to offer you

some juicy gig right here in t...

MICHAEL

She would never.  Never.  Even think

of that.

JULIANNE

I guess you're right.  That would

be deceitful... manipulative...

controlling... emascula...

MICHAEL

I got the point.

JULIANNE

Still.  All's fair in love and

w...

MICHAEL

That would be a girl.  I don't

even know.

JULIANNE (murmurs)

Forgive me, okay? I was talkin'

crazy.

JULIANNE (O.S.)

It's Albanian, I think.  Or Mongolian.

Or Canadian.  One of those.  I bought

it downstairs...

JULIANNE (O.S.)

I figure, what the hell.  Can it

make me look worse?

JULIANNE

Dig, of course.  Of course, of

course, of course, of course I

have a plan.  Certainment!

JULIANNE

How? I ask myself, what would

Lucy Ricardo do in this situa...

JULIANNE

Well, one worked, once.

JULIANNE

Ricky wouldn't let her in

the show.

JULIANNE

I recall it differently, but

we digress.

JULIANNE

So in the version, you're Ethel,

with better fashion instincts.

JULIANNE

This puts you in charge of Plan B,

the unprincipled and insanely

dangerous back-up plan...

JULIANNE

In case simple lying doesn't work.

JULIANNE

Question.  What happens if you

brush your teeth with shampoo?

JULIANNE

HOLD ON.  I'M COMING IN FOR YOU!

JULIANNE

You okay? This is one of those

problem phones.

JULIANNE

Right.  Your role.  You know guys

from Sports Illustrated, yes? I

mean, you can walk right in there...

JULIANNE

You could get access to letterhead,

for example.

JULIANNE (mouthful)

... or even, maybe, their fax.

JULIANNE

It's an homage thing.

JULIANNE

Awkward girls grow up on Audrey

Hepburn movies.  You wouldn't

understand.

KIMMY

Anyway, I think you're wrong.

KIMMY

What you were saying before.

KIMMY

About Michael's job.

JULIANNE

Oh, that.  I forgot I even said

th...

KIMMY

I just think you're wrong, is all.

JULIANNE

Probably am.  Forget I brought it

up.

KIMMY

I mean, he loves his job.

JULIANNE

Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad

flights, bad hotels, real bad food.

Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe

your copy gets into one issue out

of four...

JULIANNE

What's not to love?

KIMMY

But he always says...

JULIANNE

... whatever is manly and

independent.

JULIANNE

Why would he trade that for

running, say, a big piece of

the PR at a powerful, complex,

challenging conglomerate like

your dad's?

KIMMY

That's just the sort of thing

my father and I discussed.

JULIANNE

I'm not stupid.  Say, how

about this?

KIMMY

For the twins? What in the

world is th...

JULIANNE

Gold nose hair clippers.

KIMMY

So you don't think Michael's

as happy with his job as...

KIMMY

Gold dog collars? They don't

have dogs.

JULIANNE

Hello.

KIMMY

You think he'd accept?

KIMMY

Michael.  A job like that.

JULIANNE

By any yardstick that involves

sanity, it would be the greatest

thing that ever happened to him.

Present company excepted.

JULIANNE

On the other hand, he's proud.

Last thing a man wants to admit,

is being trapped in a dispiriting

dead-end job that can never

support a family.

JULIANNE

Throw a man a life preserver.

He'll say, "Thanks, anyway,

I'd rather drown."

KIMMY

So... one almost has to...

JULIANNE

Exactly.

KIMMY

Exactly what?

JULIANNE

What you said.  Make it appear

that he's doing you the favor.

JULIANNE

I couldn't really... do that.

After, you know...

JULIANNE (kind, but wise)

... lying.  All the time.

JULIANNE

Oh, darling, my pitiful desires

and ambitions are dirt beneath

the manly boots of your priorities!

JULIANNE (pouring it on)

Two hundred seedy motels a year?

Dinners out of vending machines?

Waiting for you in vermin-infested

corridors of dark crotch-rot locker

rooms? This stuff makes me hot!!

KIMMY

The very words I've used.

JULIANNE

We make Dad your co-conspirator.

Michael does a favor for Walter.

JULIANNE

Walter's reorganizing his public

relations, needs a brilliant guy

who's close to him, who he can

completely trust.

JULIANNE

So you beg.  Michael, please do

this for Daddy, please, please,

please, blah, blah, blah... it's

only for six months...  it would

mean so much to me to help him out...

KIMMY

He'll see right through it.

JULIANNE

Only.  If he wants to.

JULIANNE

In six months, he'll be happy,

settled, successful...

KIMMY

He won't get mad, huh?

MR.  MOONEY (O.S.)

May I be of any help, whatsoever?

JULIANNE

Bridesmaid gifts for two, well,

assertive, outspoken, Tennessee

debutantes.

KIMMY (still focused)

He won't be mad?

JULIANNE (to Mooney)

Nothing here seems to quite capture

their distinctive personalities.

MR.  MOONEY

Something customized, perhaps?

We can fashion most any item

from gold.

MR.  MOONEY

An object that might represent

what is closest. To their heart.

KIMMY (under her breath)

Don't even think dildo.

JULIANNE

Could you do this...

JULIANNE

In 24 carat?

KIMMY (softly)

Bingo.

KIMMY

You don't think he'll be mad.

JULIANNE

Your call.  You can live a lie.

In a fabulous selection of Red

Roof Inns.  Or you can make one

desperate stab at hap...

KIMMY

I just don't want to freak him

out.

JULIANNE

How mad could he get?

MAITRE D'

Oh, Mr. Wallace and his guests

have retired to the humidor.

MAITRE D'

Oh.  Mademoiselle.

MAITRE D'

It's unofficial, of course.  But,

traditionally, the humidor is for

gentlemen, only...

JULIANNE

Great.  I've got this girlfriend

at the Justice Department?  With

all this time on her hands?

JULIANNE (murmurs)

Piece of cake.  I'll hang, and

think happy thoughts...

GUY

Know what you're looking for,

little lady?

JULIANNE

Yeah.  Do you?

GUY

I asked first.

JULIANNE

I like 'em long and hard.  Kind

of... big around.

JULIANNE

Smell is important, I'm a believer

in that.

JULIANNE

But you never know what you've

got.  Till you run your tongue

over it.

GUY

I meant.  What you're looking for

in a man.

JULIANNE

Actually, I'm partial to married

gentlemen.

GUY

Why is that?

JULIANNE

It's so much time.  When I phone

the wives.

WALTER

(simply)

Your idea?

WALTER

You're a woman of insight.

WALTER

My wife and I love this marriage,

and deplore its circumstances.

WALTER

As you guessed, my daughter is

unhappy about giving up her life.

And, in my opinion, cowardly in

avoiding the necessary confrontation.

WALTER

Mike has a world of ability.

I'd do anything to have him in

my company.

WALTER

Except ask him.

WALTER

He'd resent it.  And me.  And,

most important, Kim.

WALTER

He's a great kid, but he's still

a kid.  Instead of recognizing

that his resistance comes from

insecurity, he'd turn it to anger.

To protect himself...

WALTER

... from realizing that he's

ignoring my daughter's needs,

despite how very much he loves her.

WALTER

They both have some growing up

to do.  But they're good people,

they're starting with love.

They've got time.

JULIANNE

(softly)

I think you're making a mistake,

sir.

WALTER

And that interests me.  How

someone who knows him so well

could be so wrong.

JULIANNE

See, I love him, too, as much

as anyone here.  And for a

whole lot longer.

JULIANNE

I think I know best what would

make him happy.

JULIANNE

Okay, okay, okay, okay, I hear

you, all right?

JULIANNE

It is stupid, dishonest, desperate

beyond belief, and can't possibly

ever work.  It can only end in

humiliation and disgrace.  Now can

I say two words?

JULIANNE

Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

Do it! Do it!

JULIANNE

All right, twelve words.

TEENAGER

(supportive)

You do it, girl.

MICHAEL

Wow.  What was going on in

there?

JULIANNE

Some crazy person.

MICHAEL

You're not eating.

JULIANNE

I never eat when I'm serene.

MICHAEL

You never eat when you're

despondent.

JULIANNE

I switched that around when you

weren't looking.

MICHAEL

Last zoo we were in was...

Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos

were fucking.

JULIANNE

Boy, those were the days.

MICHAEL

(softly)

Yeah, they were.

JULIANNE

That was nice.  The way you

said that.

MICHAEL

It's weird being the groom.  All

these things Kimmy has to take

care of...

JULIANNE

You need a baby-sitter.  That's

what I'm here for.

JULIANNE

Say it.

MICHAEL

Now, there's my girl.

JULIANNE

See, I can only do it with

beer.

MICHAEL

(murmurs)

See, better already.

MICHAEL

We'll go back to the bathroom,

you'll put this on...

JULIANNE

Bet you're glad I'm here to

take care of you.

MICHAEL

Bet I am.

MICHAEL

Hope that crazy person's not

still there.

JULIANNE (O.S.)

She doesn't scare me.

JULIANNE

(whispers)

Is anybody watching?

WALTER

I hope so.  This is all too

mysterious to waste on just me.

JULIANNE

I picked up Michael's messages

for him, at our hotel.  I stole

one...

WALTER

Julianne, reading my son-in-law's

mail, is not something...

JULIANNE

Sir, this is important! Haven't

you ever in your life cut one

corner, to make something important

turn out right?

WALTER

Matter of fact, that's how I got

married.

JULIANNE

It's a fax from Sports Illustrated

from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.

WALTER

(quickly)

I know Ben.

JULIANNE

"Mike.  We still have no answer to

our E-mail of Wednesday.  Which

option do you select? I don't mean

to rush you, but Personnel needs to

tie up the loose ends."

JULIANNE

I think he's been fired.

WALTER

It doesn't say th...

JULIANNE

He's said some things over the

past few weeks.  Look, this is why

I came up with the idea of you

offering him a job.

JULIANNE

And why I couldn't say anything

before in front of Kim.

JULIANNE

I just think of how... desperate

he must be feeling.  He's marrying

a rich man's daughter, and he's

about to become destitute.  You

know the kind of job market he'll

be facing?

WALTER

And you think he's kept this to

himself.

JULIANNE

He's too proud to beg for help.

And if you wait till this comes out,

your offer will be like charity.

Completely humiliating.

JULIANNE

If you do it now, it's like he's

helping you.  He can accept with

dignity.

WALTER

This fax could mean... any number

of things...

WALTER

(softly)

Maybe.  I should call Ben.

JULIANNE

Then it could all come out, sooner

or later.  Nobody should be in on

this.  Just you and me.  Or, more

correctly, I.

JULIANNE

What if, what if I could find

that E-mail?

JULIANNE

I never noticed.  Kimmy has your

eyes.

JULIANNE

Hello, again.

JULIANNE

You still haven't straightened

that tie.

JULIANNE

You know, my friend, the one

whose message I picked up...  ?

JULIANNE

Well, he's still with the wedding

party.  And he asked me to get

something he needs real badly from

his room...  ?

JULIANNE

He's in 1526.  If you could just

let me ha...

BOY

See that woman?

BOY

She said, if I ever pull a stunt

like that again...

JULIANNE

You'll lose your job...

BOY

... tear my pecker off.  Is what

she said.

JULIANNE

Help me!

JULIANNE

I locked myself out, 1526, please

hurry!!

JULIANNE

Uno-cinco-does-ses.

JULIANNE

(murmurs)

You wouldn't change your

password, would you?  You

never change anything.

JULIANNE

(murmurs)

Shoeless... Joe.

JULIANNE

(reads as she types)

Mike.  I hate this downsizing

shit as much as you do.  But I

know this can't become as a

complete surprise...

WALTER

(reads)

Mike.  I hate this downsizing...

WALTER

(softly)

And Kimmy doesn't know.

WALTER

(signs)

I'll tell her I've reconsidered.

WALTER

You're a smart girl, Jules.

WALTER

Wish my daughter.  Bad your

guts.

MICHAEL

Sure you're okay?

MICHAEL

It's not just a gag, huh?

KIMMY

No, it's, uh... a real big favor.

MICHAEL

I wish you'd just... come out

with it.  I mean why are we

waiting for Jules?

KIMMY

Moral support.

KIMMY

What's good of having a big

sister, if she...

MICHAEL

(softly)

Wow and wow.  You have a date,

after this?

JULIANNE

Never can tell.

MICHAEL

You make me think of that song,

we used to...

MICHAEL

(singing)

Someday.  When I'm awfully low...

MICHAEL

Okay, kid.  You're on.

KIMMY

It's really my father.  Who

needs the favor.

KIMMY

He's... he's reorganizing some of

the divisions of the company...

MICHAEL

(quiet)

He never mentioned that.  Neither

did y...

KIMMY

(blurting)

... and public relations is a big

problem area for him.

KIMMY

He needs someone incredible,

someone really close, who he

can trust...

MICHAEL

Like family, huh?

KIMMY

It would only be, maybe, six

months? Or three or four? It

would mean so much to him...

MICHAEL

To him.

KIMMY

And to m...

MICHAEL

(sharp, to Julianne)

... and you knew about this.

JULIANNE

I think you ought to listen to

her, Michael.  This is her life,

too.

MICHAEL

Well, which is it?

MICHAEL

You gonna tell me Daddy thought

this one up? All of a sudden, I'm

the only jerk alive who can help

him deal with the press?

MICHAEL

Why don't you start being honest

for one fucking sec...

JULIANNE

Michael!!

KIMMY

(near tears)

I am honest!

KIMMY

All of a sudden, I'm supposed to

drop out of school, forget my

family, forget my career, forget

all the plans I had for my life...

MICHAEL

Well, forgive me for screwing up

your plans!

MICHAEL

I'm sure glad I'm hearing all

this now, before it's too late!

KIMMY

What is that sup...

MICHAEL

And what am I supposed to do with

my life, huh? I am 28 years old!

I work in a low-paying, low-status,

zero-respect job which,

unfortunately, I happen to fucking

love.  How inconvenient.

MICHAEL

No problem.  A little bullshit

about Daddy's "needs," and presto,

I'm a lap dog in high society.

JULIANNE

(softly)

Michael, it sounds like a

wonderful opportun...

MICHAEL

(whips around)

Does it, really? How come you

never took some sell-out

establishment job? You had plenty

of chances!

MICHAEL

I'll tell you why.  Because that

isn't you.  And it isn't me,

either!  We're the same person!

MICHAEL

What a sweet little picture.  Mommy

and Daddy aren't losing a daughter,

they're gaining a eunuch!

KIMMY

Well, if that's the way you f...

MICHAEL

Damn straight, it's how I feel!

What's their wedding gift, a little

gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"?

Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?

MICHAEL

Great!  Tears!  The big equalizer.

You wait till two days before the

wedding to drop this on me, and

I'm just supposed to roll over and

drool!

MICHAEL

Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist

asshole, and you're well rid of m...

KIMMY

MICHAEL!!

KIMMY

Michael, you are so...

KIMMY

... so right.  And I am so very

wrong.

KIMMY

We can't go down two roads.  And

still be together.

JULIANNE

Uh, Kimmy...?

KIMMY

(ignores her)

We settled this.  And I reneged.

That wasn't fair.

KIMMY

You have to forgive me, and forget

this ever happened...

KIMMY

... or I'll die.

JULIANNE

... see that's what I never

counted on! I never heard of

a brilliant moron before!

JULIANNE

I mean, the little twerp

GROVELED!!

JULIANNE

SHE IS SO WRONG FOR HIM!

JULIANNE

Michael and I are the same person!

Self-absorbed and imperfect and

vaguely loveable! We deserve

each other!

JULIANNE

I'm out of hope, I'm out of sneaky

ideas, I'm at the end of my

rapidly-fraying hysterical little

rope!  Help m...

JULIANNE (O.S.)

God, I hate this hotel.

JULIANNE (O.S.)

And I hate talking to your machine!

DIGGER

You stole my line.

JULIANNE

Oh, shit!

DIGGER

Chill.  We don't want your face

coming off with it.

JULIANNE

Chill?  Since when do you say

ch...

DIGGER

When I'm talking to children.

JULIANNE

You flew all the way h...

DIGGER

I noticed.  I'm on the noon back.

We have this thing with George's

family in the Hamptons.

JULIANNE

(soft)

You're butting in.

JULIANNE

(softer)

I really resent this.

JULIANNE

What I mean, when I say annoyingly

perfect, is that there is nothing

annoying about her perfection.

It is vulnerable and endearing.

And that is annoying as shit.

DIGGER

You like her.

JULIANNE

If I didn't have to hate her, I'd

adore her.

JULIANNE

Last night, she was crying, these

big, real tears, when she thought

she'd lost him.  It was like there

was a knife in her heart...

JULIANNE

... and I put it there.  I hated

myself, I grieved for her, I

couldn't enjoy one second of it!

And then, when it didn't work...

JULIANNE

I was devastated.

DIGGER

(softly)

Go figure you.

JULIANNE

Because I realized.  When I see

him say "I do," that knife will

be in my heart.  And it will be

there every...

JULIANNE

... every time I think of him,

forever, which could be a lot.

JULIANNE

You watch a guy caress his

girlfriend's butt.  You see an

Old Spice commercial.  Sentimental

moments are everywhere, when

you're in the right frame of mind.

JULIANNE

There are 18,250 nights in the

next 50 years...

DIGGER

You've been working on this, huh?

JULIANNE

... and having "done the right

thing" will only really be

comforting, oh, maybe, five,

six times.

JULIANNE

This is my whole life's happiness.

I have to be ruthless.

DIGGER

(quietly)

And you believe that.

JULIANNE

(unconvincing)

Sure.

JULIANNE

He was in love with me every day

for nine years.  I can make him

happier than she can.

DIGGER

It's not his happiness you're

feeling guilty about...

JULIANNE

(proudly)

I don't know the meaning of the

word guilt!

DIGGER

Impressive.

JULIANNE

I am breaking her heart in the short

run, but doing her a gigantic favor!

She would be miserable tagging

along after this insensitive doofus!

DIGGER

The man you love.

JULIANNE

Beyond reason.  The feminist

warrior will rise up in this kid,

and she'll be standing over his

sleeping form with a butcher

knife, selecting from a short

list of body parts!

DIGGER

Someday she'll thank you.

JULIANNE

Let's not get carried away.

JULIANNE

I'd settle for.  Someday, I'll

forgive myself.

JULIANNE

For doing this terrible thing.

JULIANNE

Which, by the way, I can't

figure out how to do.

DIGGER

Jesus.  You're supposed to take

your make-up off before you

apply the m...

JULIANNE

I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY

GRIEF!

JULIANNE

Guess what I brushed my teeth

with last night?

DIGGER

Zit cream?

JULIANNE

I wish.

DIGGER

Neosporin?

JULIANNE

Try less appropriate.

DIGGER

Ben Gay.

JULIANNE

That was Thursday.

DIGGER

Elmer's Glue?

JULIANNE

DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING

A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!

DIGGER

I give.

JULIANNE

I can't even say it.

JULIANNE

A hint.  The first word is

"Preparation." Then comes a

letter of the alphabet,

perilously close to G.

DIGGER

Considering the circumstances,

I'm not wholly against suicide...

DIGGER

Just not by electrocution in

front of me!

DIGGER

I've got this noon flight.

JULIANNE

How do you know you can touch

that plug? Are you a licensed

contractor?

DIGGER

What do you suggest?

JULIANNE

Maybe they just seal off this

room.  They have others.

DIGGER

I didn't mean about that.

JULIANNE

If I hear the words "tell the

truth," or any paraphrase thereof,

I dive into the sink and pull you

with me.

DIGGER

Let's go meet Michael.  I'll

wait downstairs.

DIGGER

I suppose it's too late to

start over.

JULIANNE

It's too late to start over.

MICHAEL

You guys are heartless, my

bride picked this out.

JULIANNE

Like I said, dazzling.

DIGGER

Is she going to dress you

every day?

MICHAEL

Yeah, it's in the contract.

DIGGER

(softly)

Well, then, I'll take it up

with her.

DIGGER

The cut here, here... this

line...

DIGGER

... trouser width, this is all

classic.  Which means safe,

something I'd wear.

MICHAEL

I should look different.

DIGGER

You should look like you

dressed yourself.

MICHAEL

And I'm supposed to respect

your fashion tips, because

you're what, a New Yorker?

DIGGER

(quiet smile)

Something like that.

MICHAEL

(means this)

Long trip.  Pretty nice of you

to come.

DIGGER

Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted

to meet the one that got away.

DIGGER

What?

MICHAEL

I'm just glad someone finally put

this thing in its proper perspective.

MICHAEL

(to Digger)

Stay, huh?

DIGGER

I honestly wish I could...

MICHAEL

I'll call George's parents.

Tell them I need a best man who

actually looks after me.

JULIANNE

(softly)

They'd say that's my job.

JULIANNE

I'll take it home from here.

DIGGER

Two words.

JULIANNE

Major.  Dish.

DIGGER

Manicure...

DIGGER

Fly.

MICHAEL

(to Digger)

You don't miss much.

DIGGER

Part of being a New Yorker.

JULIANNE

Bye, handsome.

JULIANNE

You're going to say it, aren't

you?

DIGGER

Tell him you love him.  With

all your heart.

JULIANNE

I'm taking my next book to

Viking.

DIGGER

Tell him you've loved him for

nine years, but you were afraid

to realize it.

JULIANNE

I'm moving this book to Viking.

DIGGER

Tell him you're afraid of love.

Afraid of needing.

JULIANNE

Needing.

DIGGER

To belong to someone.

DIGGER

We all do, beautiful.  I'm sorry

about that.

DIGGER

Tell him you know this is the

worst, dumbest, cruelest moment

to do this to him.  But there

it is, and he has to choose.

JULIANNE

And what will he do?

DIGGER

He'll choose Kim.  You'll stand

by her at her wedding.  You'll

kiss him good-bye.  And you'll

go home.

DIGGER

This is what you've come to do.

Now do it.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Big weddings are so strange.

JULIANNE (O.S.)

You keep saying that.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Kim has all this stuff to do,

I hardly see her.

JULIANNE (O.S.)

Well, you've got the rest of

your lives.

JULIANNE

Getting your bed made.  Every

day.

JULIANNE

You miss her, huh?

MICHAEL

No.  I've got you.

MICHAEL

Don't you throw up on boat?

JULIANNE

If you like.

MICHAEL

I've been thinking a lot the

last couple days.  About us,

actually.

JULIANNE

(casual)

Have you.

JULIANNE

Well.  There's a lot of memories

to choose from...

MICHAEL

It's more than that.

MICHAEL

I mean, it's embarrassing to

say it this way, but...

MICHAEL

You've sort of been... y'know,

the woman in my life.

JULIANNE

(straight back)

You've been the man in mine.

MICHAEL

And I was thinking this could be

our last time.  Alone.  Together.

You know?

JULIANNE

Except for the hot affairs we'll

have twice a year.

MICHAEL

Except for that.

MICHAEL

I can hardly wait for your

wedding.

JULIANNE

Me either.

MICHAEL

Boy, I never thought I'd hear you

say that.  Can I come?

JULIANNE

I couldn't have it without you.

MICHAEL

It's normal to have... second

thoughts, huh? To be scared.

JULIANNE

I wouldn't know.  I never had

that many first thoughts.

MICHAEL

I mean, you commit to a wedding.

And then it seems like... this...

momentum, you know?  You forget

you... chose it.

MICHAEL

You and I.  I mean, in all our

relationships with other people...

We didn't use the word "love"

a lot, did we?

MICHAEL

Kimmy says.  When you love someone.

You say it, you say it out loud.

Right now.  Or the moment...

MICHAEL

... passes you by, yeah.  She's a

smart girl.

MICHAEL

We don't have a song.

MICHAEL

Kimmy and I.  We don't have a song.

Is that a bad sign?

MICHAEL

(sings, softly)

Someday, when I'm awfully low...

And the world is cold...

MICHAEL

(sings)

I will feel a glow just Thinking of you...

And the way you look.  Tonight.

MICHAEL

Dance card filled?

JULIANNE

I'll check.  I have it on

powerbook, these days.

MICHAEL

(sings in her ear)

With each word, your tenderness grows,

Tearing my fears apart...

MICHAEL

(sings)

And that laugh

That wrinkles your nose,

Touches my foolish heart.

MICHAEL

Where did we first hear th...

JULIANNE

(straight back)

The night we met.

JULIANNE

The night we fell in love.

MICHAEL

So we heard it... like, right

that... that first...

JULIANNE

We danced to it.  Just like this.

MICHAEL

I won't lose you, will I?

JULIANNE

No.  Because I won't let you.

WALTER

I thought Michael was picking

me up.

JULIANNE

I told him, get the important

stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect

the inconsequentials.

WALTER

Kim said, when he turned down

the job, there was no friction.

JULIANNE

Friction.  No.

WALTER

I haven't caused... a problem,

have I?

JULIANNE

Nobody has.  So far.

WALTER

Well, you're a little early...

JULIANNE

I need to make some calls.

Could I use... your office?

JULIANNE

(softly)

You can do this.

JULIANNE

(mumbling to herself)

E-mail address.  To Ben Isaacson,

Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated,

from... Walter Wallace.

JULIANNE

See, you can do it.  It's easy.

JULIANNE

You do it fast, it's over.  Like

it never happened.

JULIANNE

Ben.  I need a favor.

JULIANNE

My daughter's every happiness.

And my wife's.  And, least of

all, my own, are in your hands.

JULIANNE

Knowing you value our friendship,

and the... cooperative

relationship between our companies...

I am hopeful of your help.

JULIANNE

I have offered Mike O'Neal, my

new son-in-law, a great opportunity

in my company.  This would also

enable my daughter to settle in

Chicago, near us, and pursue her

dreams and plans.

JULIANNE

To his own detriment, as well

as ours, Michael will not accept

our offer.  While he works for you.

JULIANNE

My daughter joins me in this

plea for your cooperation and

discretion.

JULIANNE

With gratitude.  For your

understanding.  Walter.

JULIANNE

Are you crazy?  Get him fired?

JULIANNE

Just till tonight when I bring

him back.  To look for...

WALTER

(going through stack)

Off to rehearsal.  Send out this,

and this, not this, this, and...

that's it.

WALTER

I'm holding four or five E-mails

I wrote over lunch...

WALTER

Send 'em out.

MANDY

Reverend Dyer, this is

Kimberly's somewhat butch

maid of honor...

SAMMY

... Mr. Julianne Potter,

prominent New York drag queen.

MINISTER

Billy Dyer, Julianne.  And I

love the suit.

MICHAEL

(softly)

Takes me back.

JULIANNE

Well.

JULIANNE

You sang the song.  Least I

could do was wear the outfit.

MICHAEL

Except now you're better-

looking.

MICHAEL

I got the ring.

MANDY/SAMMY

(sing)

Swi-i-ng low-ow-ow...

Wee-ee-eet Char-i-ot...

MANDY/SAMMY

(sing)

Comin', to car-ryyy

Me ho-o-o-me...

JULIANNE

No accents today.

MICHAEL

Yeah, Kim told me they were

giving you their Dueling

Scarlet's act.  Actually,

they're sophomores at Juilliard.

MICHAEL

Will she like it?

JULIANNE

(whisper)

Yes.

KIMMY (O.S.)

My groom-person!  Your family

needs you!

MANDY/SAMMY

(O.S., singing)

Well, I look over yon-der,

And what did I see-ee-ee?

MANDY/SAMMY

(O.S., singing)

Comin too car-ryyy.

Me ho-o-ome...

MANDY/SAMMY

(O.S., singing)

It was a hand.  Of a-a-angels.

Coming' for me-e-ee...

MANDY/SAMMY

(O.S., singing)

Comin' for to carry me home.

JOE

Like to welcome ever'body to

our little rehearsal supper...

JOE

Okay, everyone stand up!

JOE

To the bride, uh, goes the

honor... of cracking the first

crab!

KIMMY

But first, a toast!

JULIANNE

(on the spot)

I'm right-handed.

KIMMY

To our host, my cuddly Papa

Joe.

KIMMY

Who taught me to play "Blue

Hawaii." On my nose.

MANDY/SAMMY (O.S.)

Boo!!!

MANDY

I know why you're scared of our

party.  It's too hip.

SAMMY

Kimberly wanted to tickle the

grandmas, so we figured, give

'em a cheap thrill.  Walter

supplied the decorative

touches...

SAMMY

(points out the jokes)

Nose tackle from the Bears...

power forward from the Bulls...

defenseman from the Black

Hawks... my personal favorite,

the designated hitter...

MANDY

... I'm partial to the tight end.

SAMMY

This is USDA Prime, largely

available, beef.  With no notice-

able competition, present company

excepted...

SAMMY

And yet here you are.  All

celibate and reclusive.

MANDY

With those big, dark, haunted eyes.

As if you were harborin' some...

unspeakably... guilty... secret.

JULIANNE

Well, I'm worried about something.

JULIANNE

Oh.  I left this really important

file in Walter's office.  I have

to send my editor some...

JULIANNE

... figures.  On territorial sales.

To close my book deal.

JULIANNE

So Kim gave me the key.  And

Michael's on his way, to drive

me down to Wal...

SAMMY

Oh.  We thought it was the ring.

MANDY

The one you better get the fuck

off your third finger left hand.

JULIANNE

Well.  See.  That was a...

reflex to see if it would...

MANDY

(helpful)

... look good on Kimberly.

JULIANNE

Right.  And then it didn't want

to come off.  Exactly.

SAMMY

Maybe it's happy there.

MANDY

Oh the way out of the crab house?

We asked Michael if we could see

the ring?

SAMMY

He said you told him.  It'd be

safer with you.

MANDY

An so it is.

MANDY

Shut up, sugar, he's on his way.

Let's get to work.

EIGHT PEOPLE

TWIST IT!  TWIST IT!

JANITOR

It's mental, lady, you ain't

trying!

SAMMY

There is nothing so tight, this

can't help it...

MANDY

I saw this on Hard Copy.  People

cut off body parts and the

hospital sew 'em back o...

JULIANNE

(cold)

I saw the show.

MANDY

... well, maybe it works on

fingers, too.

FLOWER GIRL (O.S.)

Aunt Mandy...?

FLOWER GIRL

Mr.  Michael's here.

MANDY

Don't worry, baby.  You could

pick your nose with that finger

and Michael would never notice.

He's a man.

MANDY (O.S.)

Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's

marrying the wrong girl.

SAMMY (O.S.)

You're much more his type.

JULIANNE

I can't believe this!

MICHAEL

It's no big deal, she just gave

you the wrong keys that's s...

JULIANNE

ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR?

A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL

TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S

GOTTA BE IN TH...

JULIANNE

WHERE'S A BRICK?  FIND ME A

GODDAMN BRICK!!

MICHAEL

What is the big deal about

getting this file tonight?

JULIANNE

I promised Digger I'd E-mail him

those figures.

JULIANNE

They are very important figures.

JULIANNE

I'm up against a deadline.

MICHAEL

Me, too.  I'm getting married

tomorrow.

JULIANNE

That's my point!!

JULIANNE

I mean, tomorrow... we'll all be

busy with more important things.

So...

JULIANNE

... tonight's my last chance.

MICHAEL

I forgot how cute you look.  When

you get impossible.

JULIANNE

It's just... up there... right in

front of Walter's... y'know, computer.

If memory serves.

JULIANNE

We could use... his computer, to...

just E-mail those suckers right ou...

MICHAEL

Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing

business.  Crack of dawn, Monday,

Walter'll take you up there...

MICHAEL

(softly)

Give it up, kid.

MICHAEL

You can't win 'em all.

MICHAEL

(gently)

Listen up, huh? Even if you blow

this deal, how big could it be?

JULIANNE

(voice nearly cracking)

You're right.  Easy come, easy go.

MICHAEL

(softly)

Jules?

MICHAEL

This thing means that much to

y...

JULIANNE

It means a lot.

MICHAEL

I'll call the house, Walter's

probably not even asleep...

MICHAEL

I'll drive you out there, we'll

get the key, we'll go back to

the office...

MICHAEL

Come on, we'll call from your

room.

MICHAEL

If I fall asleep on the altar

tomorrow...

MICHAEL

... you better be there to...

funny, these are all from Ben.

MICHAEL

The fax is from Ben, too.  Man,

it's my wedding, and my boss can't

leave me alone...

JULIANNE

(entering her room)

... maybe it's congratulations.

JULIANNE

(turning to him)

Michael? What ha...

MICHAEL

(reading)

Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing

this to you on the night before

your wedding.  But I think you

need and deserve to know...

MICHAEL

... what you're marrying into.

JULIANNE

(reading)

I received the following E-mail

this afternoon... "Ben, I need a

favor.  My daughter's every

happiness...  "

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Isabelle?  I need to talk to

Kim...

JULIANNE

(reading)

"Mike, the funny thing is, he's

offering you a gig you'd be

stupid to turn down..."

MICHAEL (O.S.)

I'm just tired.  Please put her

on?  Thanks.

JULIANNE

(reading)

"Maybe you should take the job.

And dump the girl."

MICHAEL

Jules.  Could you give me a

minute?

MICHAEL

Please?

BELLMAN

Miss, are you locked out,

or something?

JULIANNE

No, I just stepped out, because...

it's a non-smoking room.

BELLMAN

(politely)

Well, it's non-smoking floor,

too.  Maybe you could go to the...

JULIANNE

(seriously)

Why don't you have me arrested?

JULIANNE

I mean that.  Arrested, convicted,

put in solitary.

JULIANNE

See, I'm a dangerous, criminal

person.  I do bad things to

honest people.  This, see, this

smoking?  Tip of the iceberg.

JULIANNE

Make a citizen's arrest, I won't

struggle.  It'll be like getting

Al Capone on tax evasion.

BELLMAN

Can I... Can I help you, miss?

JULIANNE

Do you smoke, Richard?

BELLMAN

Yes, ma'am, I do, but it's...

JULIANNE

... a non-smoking floor, yeah.

Well, you know what?

BELLMAN

My grandmother always said,

"This, too, shall pass."

JULIANNE

Thanks, Richard.  If you weren't

on duty, I'd buy you a drink.

JULIANNE

What happened?

MICHAEL

(softly)

It's over.

MICHAEL

I want you to quit this shit,

it'll kill you.

MICHAEL

She denied it.  Said I was crazy

and paranoid.

JULIANNE

A bad combination.

MICHAEL

There's this big brunch tomorrow

morning?  At her place.

MICHAEL

She said "How can I call everything

off, what do I tell everybody?"

JULIANNE

Michael...

MICHAEL

No, it's for the best, it really

is.  We were so wrong for each

other.

JULIANNE

Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...

MICHAEL

The job thing would have broken

us up, eventually, anyway.  She

couldn't have lived with it.  I

know that now.

MICHAEL

And she's right, I'm crazy to

fall for someone.  I hardly

knew.

MICHAEL

Hey.  You still got that ring?

JULIANNE

I tried it on.  But it won't

come off.

JULIANNE

It's mental, you know.

JULIANNE

Should we take a walk?  Or

maybe some food sent up, or

something...

MICHAEL

I just want to be alone.  Is

that okay?

MICHAEL

Maybe I'll go back to New York.

Hang with you for awhile, huh?

Ben'll understand.

MICHAEL

Or we'll go somewhere.  If you

have the time.

JULIANNE

If San Antonio sweeps

Sacramento...

JULIANNE

I've never been to Texas.

MICHAEL

Thanks for coming to my wedding.

DIGGER (V.O.  MACHINE)

Digger and George are with

family in the Hamptons until

Monday morning.  Brevity is even

more in order than usual.

JULIANNE

Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...

JULIANNE

(softly)

I won.

JULIANNE

Amazing, huh?  I didn't do things

quite your way.  But... I got it

down.

JULIANNE

And forty years and nine grand-

children later, when I sit with

Michael on some rustic porch,

slogging through our sweet swamp

of nostalgic memories...

JULIANNE

No one is going to sweet the

details...

JULIANNE

Of one weekend in Chicago.

JULIANNE

Talk about celebration...

JULIANNE

I'm gonna brush my teeth with

actual toothpaste.

JULIANNE

I guess I'm too exhausted to

feel the elation I so richly

undeserve...

JULIANNE

So I'm gonna hold calls at the

desk... while I get my...

JULIANNE

(around, her mouthful)

God, it is toothpaste, they

should sell this stuff

commercially! Anyway, a girl

does need her...

JULIANNE

... well, we're a bit past

worrying about beauty sleep.

Let's just settle for not

frightening small animals.

JULIANNE

Anyway, I couldn't have done

it without you.  Even though I

did, if you follow that.

JULIANNE

Three words:  Happily.  Ever.

Well, you know.

SMASH CUT TO:

JULIANNE

(to the slip)

You're going where?

ISABELLE

Jules.  We're so glad you

slept in.

ISABELLE

Now, you have a choice.  The idea

is bride and groom shouldn't see

each other on the magic day...

ISABELLE

So Michael stays put in the garden.

Kimmy stays in here...

ISABELLE (O.S.)

... and the guests go back and

forth.  Where will you start?

JULIANNE

She looks tense.

ISABELLE

(O.S., calmly)

Nerves.  I would never have

guessed.

JULIANNE

I had the craziest dream last

night?  Walter and Kimmy had

asked your boss to...

MICHAEL

Look, I came down here to face

everybody.  I didn't want to

slink away like some coward...

JULIANNE

But the Scotch salmon was so

fucking good, you decided to

stay for brunch!

MICHAEL

She hasn't told anybody, what

am I supposed to do?

JULIANNE

Get married, apparently.

JULIANNE

What the hell are you thinking

of, the goddamn wedding is SIX

O'CLOCK!!

MICHAEL

This is her family and her

fault.

JULIANNE

And your point?

MICHAEL

(ten years old)

Well.  How come she didn't...

JULIANNE

BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS

YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR

EACH OTHER.

MICHAEL

Hey.  This is a serious matter.

JULIANNE

I'll be right back.

KIMMY

Look at all this beautiful food,

so lovingly prepared...

JULIANNE

They'll eat it anyway, you ever

been to a walk?

JULIANNE

You guys want to give us a

minute?

JULIANNE

We'd like to be alone with

our pork.

KIMMY

How's he doing?

JULIANNE

Who?  The jerk who's running

your life?

KIMMY

This must be... very, very,

hard on him.

JULIANNE

What with the psychosis and

all, yeah.

JULIANNE

When are you gonna come clean

with your folks?

KIMMY

Don't you see...

JULIANNE

If you're waiting for "Do you

take this man?", that's

considered poor form.

KIMMY

... that this is all my fault?

KIMMY

Whatever delusions I drove him to,

there is truth at the heart of it.

I want him to work for my father.

I want to stay in school.  I want

a life of my own!

JULIANNE

Yeah, well, lots of couples are

imcompat...

KIMMY

I love him.

KIMMY

Tell him it's my fault and

that I love him.

JULIANNE

I'll be right back.

MICHAEL

How is she?

JULIANNE

KNOCK IT OFF!!!

STONER KID

(Minnie Mouse)

YES, SIR!

MICHAEL

I asked you...

JULIANNE

She admits it's her fault.

MICHAEL

Do you think she still loves

me?

JULIANNE

Sure, she does.  She's crazy

about you.

MICHAEL

I keep asking, how can I explain

what happened? And I keep

getting that same answer all

night long.

MICHAEL

I can't.  And it doesn't matter.

I drove her to it, because I

want things my way.  And even

if she did something tricky and

unfair... she was blinded by

love, okay?

JULIANNE

Does that make it right...

MICHAEL

Love doesn't have to be right.

It just has to be love.

MICHAEL

She's giving up half her life

for me, and I'm bitching because

it hurts her.

STONERS

(singing)

Sail on silver girl

Sail on by...

MICHAEL

She's a saint!  And I'm a

worthless ingrate!

STONERS

(singing)

Your time has come to shine,

All your dreams are on their way...

MICHAEL

Tell her.  I'll marry her at six

o'clock, if she'll still have me.

JULIANNE

I'll be right back.

KIMMY

(whispers)

So.  What did he say?

JULIANNE

He said.  Marry me.

MICHAEL

(never looks up)

Thank God you were here.

JULIANNE

(mumbles to herself)

Oh, yeah.

MICHAEL

I was so confused, so conflicted,

so... unstable.

JULIANNE

Well, it happens.

MICHAEL

I might have thrown away...

JULIANNE

... your one chance for true

happiness?

MICHAEL

... yeah, that.

JULIANNE

You never want to do that, see,

that's always a... costly

turnover.  As they say in the

sport biz.

MICHAEL

(softly)

Are you okay?

JULIANNE

The Big Hurt, huh?

MICHAEL

Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the

past.  And he likes the little

guys.

JULIANNE

Got a minute?

JULIANNE

Why is the dance floor by the

gazebo?

MICHAEL

Kimmy's idea.  She thought it

would be such a romantic place.

For our wedding dance.

MICHAEL

What's up?

JULIANNE

Shhh.

JULIANNE

I have to say this quick, okay,

or I'll have this massive

coronary and you'll never have

to hear it.  Which you need to.

Does that make any sense at all?

MICHAEL

Jules, what's wrong...

JULIANNE

This is the dumbest thing I will

ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that

I can't.  I don't think.

JULIANNE

Michael, I love you.

JULIANNE

I've loved you for nine years,

but I was too arrogant and

scared to realize it.  Now I'm

just scared.

JULIANNE

I know this comes at an

inopportune time, but I have to

ask this one really gigantic

favor, okay?

JULIANNE

Choose me.  Marry me.  Let me

make you happy.

JULIANNE

I know.  It sounds like three

favors.

JULIANNE

But when you think about it...

JULIANNE

MICHAEL, DON'T, YOU'LL NEVER

CATCH HER!!

JULIANNE

SHE HAS TOO BIG A LEAD AND SHE

DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL!!!

JULIANNE

(to the world at large)

DOESN'T ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS

ANYMORE?  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO

TRUST??

JULIANNE (O.S.)

THANK GOD, A SAMARITAN!!

JULIANNE

IT IS NOT GOING WELL!

DISPATCHER (O.S.)

Uh, Unit Four Baker Charlie,

how we cookin' on that Skokiie

infestation?

JULIANNE

THIS IS WHAT COMES OF TELLING

THE TRUTH!

FIELD MAN (O.S.)

Copy, dispatcher...

JULIANNE

OR EVEN PART OF IT!

FIELD MAN (O.S.)

Uh, what happens if you got

that methyl-ethyl shit on

your hands?

JULIANNE

GETTING WHAT YOU DESERVE IS

NOT FAIR!

DISPATCHER (O.S.)

Uh, you got maybe thirty seconds

before you're sterile.  For God's

sake don't touch yourself, or

anything.

JULIANNE

AND I HATE TALKING TO YOUR

MACHINE!

YOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)

Uh, this is One Monkey Zebra.

It wasn't bees in the gal's

wall, it was cats!

YOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)

She says gas 'em, anyway,

she'll pay cash.  Uh... how

do I pay this?

JULIANNE

MICHAEL!!

JULIANNE

NNNOOOO!!!

JULIANNE

(croaks)

Don't speak!

MICHAEL

Uh.  I saw that moving...

JULIANNE

DON'T SPEAK!

JULIANNE

I have to make a confession.

Another confession.  Besides

that I love you.  This is even

worse.

JULIANNE

The E-mail?  You thought Walter

sent your boss?  I wrote that.

MICHAEL

You're not saying you actually...

you're saying that y...

JULIANNE

(stricken with remorse)

... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the

bad guy.

MICHAEL

ARE YOU CRAZY?

MICHAEL

ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY INSANE??

MICHAEL

ARE YOU ON DRUGS???

MICHAEL

(pacing in circles)

I mean, do you realize what

you've... well, of course you

realize, that's why you're

confessing, I mean... I mean...

how could you do that?

JULIANNE

I didn't know it would get

sent.  I just wanted you to...

get mad at Kimmy... and...

JULIANNE

I've done nothing but slimy,

underhanded, despicable, not

even terribly imaginative,

things.  Ever since I got

here.  Trying to...

JULIANNE

... to win you.  To win you

back.

JULIANNE

And I was blinded by love.

Like you said.

JULIANNE

But that doesn't excuse any

part of it.  I am pond scum.

JULIANNE

Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus

that feeds on pond scum.  Lower.

The layer of mucous that cruds up

the fung...

MICHAEL

Lower.

JULIANNE

(agreeing)

Lower.

MICHAEL

The pus that infects the mucous

that cruds up the fungus.

MICHAEL

(softly)

On the other hand, thank you.

MICHAEL

For loving me that much, that

way.

MICHEL

It's pretty flattering.

JULIANNE

Except it makes me fungus.

MICHAEL

Well, that part I knew.

JULIANNE

So you have to marry Kim.

Because she will actually make

you happy.  I, in contrast, am

a shallow, neurotic psychopath,

with relatively little to offer.

JULIANNE

Kim.  Nod your head.  Do as

you're told.

JULIANNE

Just promise you'll never tell

me who you would have chosen.

If I hadn't confessed.

JULIANNE

Cos if you would have chosen me.

Then I threw away a perfectly

good life.  Just to be a decent

person.  Which is a questionable

trade-off.  Right?

JULIANNE

And if you would have chosen

some 20-year-old punk over me.

I'd have to kill myself.

MICHAEL

(whispers)

I'll take it to my grave.

JULIANNE

I'm so glad you didn't jump on

that train, before...

MICHAEL

I came here, looking for her.

JULIANNE

Why would she come here...

MICHAEL

This is where I proposed.

MICHAEL

I had to cover a game in

Milwaukee.  She saw me off.

And when the train started to

leave... I jumped up on the

step, I help the handle, and

without...

MICHAEL

... without a thought in my head.

I shouted, "Marry me."

MICHAEL

And she gasped, and covered her

mouth, and the train was pulling

out, and suddenly she screamed

YES!  Just once.  And blew me a

kiss.

MICHAEL

I never forgot that.

JULIANNE

It's two weeks.

MICHAEL

Almost three.

JULIANNE

That is so romantic.

MICHAEL

I just wonder if you know why.

MICHAEL

It's because romance isn't

mystery, and tricks, and doubts,

and halting, unspoken longings.

That's not the real romance.

MICHAEL

The real romance is saying yes.

MICHAEL

(sighs)

Woulda been a nice wedding.

JULIANNE

(urgently)

You can't believe you've lost

her!  Sooner or later, you'll

find her, and you'll look in

each other's eyes, and you'll

see all that love...

JULIANNE

Course, if it's later rather

than sooner, I'd hate to be you

at six o'clock.

(beat)

You've got a lot of explaining

to...

MICHAEL

I'm just thinking of how she's

hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like

her life is over.

JULIANNE

That's little egotistical.

JULIANNE

But, undoubtedly accurate.

JULIANNE

Okay, we'll split up.  You go

to every romantic place you

guys have, I'll go... someplace

brilliant, and the first one

who...

MICHAEL

If you find her...

MICHAEL

The kiss.  May be hard.  For

you to explain.

(beat)

Because the only fear she

really has, is...

JULIANNE

... me, yeah.  And she likes

Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.

MICHAEL

But if you do get to her first...

MICHAEL

There is something you are

authorized to say.

MANDY (V.O.)

Wallace egregious residence,

Mandy speaking.

JULIANNE

It's Jules, you guys haven't

had a call from, say, Kimberly,

have you?

MANDY (V.O.)

Oh, she's slipped out, the

little monkey.  Prob'ly with

Michael, doin' the nasty.

MANDY (V.O.)

Or crying in her nachos, down

at Comskey Park.

JULIANNE

Ex-cuse me?

MANDY (V.O.)

I had this crank call?  From

some guy who thinks he saw her?

I said, what would a bride be

doin', on her wedding...

JULIANNE

You are so right.  What a

nerve on that guy!  Bring my

dress to church, huh?

JULIANNE

I want to pick up a little

something for the ceremony.

BODYGUARD

She wouldn't confide in me,

so I called the house.

BODYGUARD

Luckily, I got her cousin.

JULIANNE

Going to the john, she said?

BODYGUARD

Could be there awhile.

JULIANNE

YO!  IMMIGRATION!

JULIANNE

I GOT A WARRANT FOR MS. KIMBERLY

WALLACE!

KIMMY

(O.S., sobbing)

In here, you bitch!

JULIANNE

Let me in, baby, or I'll rip

this damn thing off its non-

code-compliant hinges...

WOMAN (O.S.)

GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY FACE OR

I'M GONNA MESS YOUR SHIT UP!!

KIMMY

(O.S., still sobbing)

Over here, nitwit!

JULIANNE

Incoming.

JULIANNE

Pitiful.

KIMMY

Haven't you done enough?

JULIANNE

In one minute.  You are going

to feel so foolish.

KIMMY

WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A

STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?

JULIANNE

Have you ever heard of.

Irony?

JULIANNE

I threw my arms around your

husband.  And kissed him with

all my heart.  Because I was

so happy.  For you.  Nitwit.

JULIANNE

(whispers)

He's going to take...

(big grin)

The job!

JULIANNE

(beaming)

With your dad, yeah.  Can you

guess why?  Bitch?

KIMMY

HE LOVES ME!!

JULIANNE

Well, of course, he loves

you.

JULIANNE

(very soft)

Hell, even I love you.

JULIANNE

I never want to go through this

again.

KIMMY

That's entirely understandable.

KIMMY (O.S.)

Shit!  THE TIME!

SAMMY

Whatever hap...

JULIANNE

(cutting this short)

We were bonding, we lost track,

we're officially sorry, now

let's put it behind us.

JULIANNE

Believe me, we got a bride who's

worth waiting for, yes?

JULIANNE

Out of our way.

JULIANNE

Don't worry, sugar.

JULIANNE

When he looks at you, it will

be as if...

JULIANNE

... he's never seen a woman

before.

WALTER

(whispers)

Left foot.

MINISTER

Michael and Kimmy wrote these

words.  She asked me to confide,

mostly Michael.

MINISTER

So he gets to say them.

MICHAEL

Why do people get married

anymore?

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Why not live together amicably,

with no sense of obligation

beyond the moment?

MICHAEL (O.S.)

As long as the sex is good.  As

long as no one more interesting

has wandered into view.  As long

as the thousand conflicts of two

individual wills remain

comfortably compromised.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

And when one feels the urge to

move on, to explore the new.

No guilt, no disgrace, no

promise broken.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

No agony of having dishonored

a time.  When our hearts.  And

the world were different.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Marriage is a lot to put up

with.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

The answer must be.  That there

is some need basic to the human

heart.  That embracing... the obligation

of commitment... fulfills.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Some need to belong to one another

in a way which rages against the

notion... that all is impermanent.

Against the notion of mortality.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Our love is bigger.  And longer.

Than life itself.

MICHAEL

That's what we want.  And marriage.

Is what we do about it.

MICHAEL

We are fools in this.  Thank

God Almighty.

MINISTER

Boy, that was good!

MINISTER

Michael and Kim also edited what

they want me to say...

MINISTER

The idea was, we're only marrying

once.  We have to remember it

forever.  Let's keep to the good

stuff.

(squints at the sheet)

You may kiss the bride.

MINISTER (O.S.)

If anyone here can show just cause

why this man and woman should not

be married, speak now.  Or forever

hold your peace.

MICHAEL

Kimberly.  I promise to love.

And respect and comfort you.

To hear your voice and your

heart.  Until we are parted

by death.

KIMMY

Michael.  I promise to love and

respect and comfort you.  To

hear your voice and your heart.

Until we are parted by death.

MINISTER

For the record, you each agree

to marry the other?

KIMMY

(quickly)

I do!

MICHAEL

(smiling)

I do.

MINISTER

We haven't said much about God

this evening, I know.  But He

is here.  And He is happy.  To

bless His wonderful children.

MINISTER (O.S.)

In that Michael and Kimberly have

given themselves to each other by

solemn vows, and the exchanging

of rings...

MINISTER (O.S.)

I pronounce them husband and wife.

Those whom God has joined together,

let no one put asunder.

MINISTER (O.S.)

Now.  Kiss the bride.

JULIANNE

I'm a writer, too, not as

good as Michael.  But I do

steal from quality.

JULIANNE

This is to my best friend.  On

the occasion of his wedding.

JULIANNE

If I have truly come to know

your bride as my new sister.

This is in her heart...

JULIANNE

"Understand.  I'll slip quietly

away from the noisy crowd when

I see the pale stars rising,

blooming, over the oaks."

JULIANNE

"I'll pursue solitary pathways

through the pale twilit meadows,

with only this one dream: You

come too."

JULIANNE

I don't have a wedding gift.

But this is on loan.  Until

you two find your song...

MANDY/SAMMY

(singing)

Someday, when I'm awfully low,

And the world is cold,

I will feel a glow just thinking of you,

And the way you look tonight.

MANDY/SAMMY

(singing)

You're lovely.  With your smile so warm,

And your cheeks so soft,

There is nothing for me but to love you,

Just the way you look tonight.

MANDY/SAMMY

(singing)

With each word, your tenderness grows,

Tearing my fears apart...

And the laugh that wrinkles your nose,

Touches my foolish heart.

JULIANNE/MANDY/SAMMY

(singing)

You're lovely, please don't ever change,

Keep that breathless charm,

Darling, please arrange it, cos I love you...

Just the way you look tonight.

MICHAEL

Wherever I go.  However far...

JULIANNE

You win a few, you lose a few.

Some get rained out.

DIGGER

(V.O., very softly)

You have a good time?

JULIANNE

I did what I came to do.

DIGGER

(V.O., even softer)

Good girl.

DIGGER (V.O.)

I was thinking.  Maybe you might

visit us for awhile.  We've got

the room made up.

JULIANNE

I'll think about it.  I'm okay.

DIGGER (V.O.)

Oh, you're more than okay.

JULIANNE

You, too.

JULIANNE

If the sun comes up, I'll see

you tomorrow, huh?

DIGGER (V.O.)

I'll play those odds.  You have

sweet dreams.
