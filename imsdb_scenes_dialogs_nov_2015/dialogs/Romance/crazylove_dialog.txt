LETTY

Listen, Beast. What have I told

you about linen?

LETTY

(looking at Beast)

It's liver saute.

LETTY

Fine, then, chicken in gravy. But

you're going to have to eat the

liver tomorrow.

2.

CHANDRA

Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.

LETTY

(to Chandra)

Goodness, this is a bad one.   Tip

your head back.

LETTY

Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch

it.

3.

JOHANSEN

Well, I have a full calendar today,

and I'm afraid...

LETTY

Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry

I'm late. It's very nice to meet

you.

PRINCIPAL GAIL

The Superintendent was just getting

ready to leave.

LETTY

I do apologize.    A student had a

crisis.

MRS. MONTES

A crisis, you say?

LETTY

A bloody nose...

LETTY

A bloody nose of epic proportions.

JOHANSEN

OK, Miss Mayer. Ten minutes.     Wow

us.

4.

LETTY

No cherry drops, Jenny.

(into the phone)

Yes, hi. I'm calling for Paul

Lascher.

(beat)

Could you tell him it's Letty?

(beat)

He can't? Um, well, tell him, tell

him that they went for my math

idea. Thanks.

LETTY

(to boys)

Not so rough, guys.

(into phone)

Mom? Hi. You'll never guess

what...I've got the best news.

(beat)

No, about work. How about dinner?

LETTY

(to Jenny)

You're in trouble, young lady.

(into the phone)

I know, Mom. But it's the only

place I can call from.

(beat)

Can you tell Ruth about dinner?

(beat)

Paul's fine, just fine.

LETTY

Got to go, Mom.   The monsters call.

5.

RUTH

Sorry I'm late.

MRS. MAYER

Letty was just getting ready to

tell me her good news.

RUTH

(to Letty)

Tell, tell.

MRS. MAYER

(leaning toward Letty)

Letty, dear, is that a cat hair on

your blouse?

LETTY

So, I got the district to approve

my after-school math program.

MRS. MAYER

How wonderful, darling.

(beat)

What does that mean for you?

LETTY

I'll be running it three days a

week, and...

MRS. MAYER

Will you get time off to do that?

LETTY

Not now, but maybe later, if they

like the program.

LETTY

(to Ruth)

What's up with you?

6.

RUTH

Me? Nothing. Tell me more about

the job.

MRS. MAYER

(to Ruth)

Not a job, a promotion.

LETTY

No, Mom, it's more of a prestige

thing.

RUTH

Mmmmmmm.

LETTY

Ruth.   Calling Ruth.

RUTH

(laughing)

Sorry.

LETTY

Just go ahead and tell us.

RUTH

There's nothing to tell.

MRS. MAYER

(to Ruth)

Are you sure, Dear?

LETTY

Come on.

RUTH

No, really. Tell me about the

promotion.

LETTY

Well, my theory is that people can

really enjoy math, but they lose

interest...

RUTH

(almost screaming)

I'm getting married.

7.

MRS. MAYER

I'm so happy for you.     It's just

wonderful.

MRS. MAYER

My goodness. A wedding.      My

goodness.

LETTY

Wow.   Congratulations.

RUTH

(to Letty)

Can you believe it?

MRS. MAYER

Tell us every detail.

LETTY

You've only known Jake a few

months.

RUTH

Three and a week.

(screaming again)

Isn't it great?

MRS. MAYER

My goodness. What about an

engagement party? We must start

planning.

(signaling a waiter)

Champagne. Girls, we need some

champagne.

CUT TO:

8.

PAUL

So, another one bites the dust.

LETTY

It's not another one. It's my

sister.

(beat)

Aren't you happy for her?

PAUL

She's only known the guy a few

months.

PAUL

Can I put these here for tonight?

LETTY

(pointing to the closet)

In there's better.

(beat)

It's kind of romantic, don't you

think?

PAUL

I really think if you're going to

spend your life with someone you

want to know them pretty damn well.

LETTY

Believe me, I know your feelings on

the matter.

PAUL

The receptionist said you called

earlier about something.

9.

LETTY

My math program. The

Superintendent said he'd fund it.

PAUL

Good going. I knew you could do

it.

PAUL

It looks like we're both bucking

for advancement.

LETTY

Yeah?

PAUL

Huntley told me today that if I

come through on the Benton

deposition, they may consider me

for senior associate.

LETTY

Congratulations.    We should

celebrate.

PAUL

I was thinking dinner on Friday

with James and Meg at the Saint

Mark.

LETTY

I mean tonight.

LETTY

Like right now...

PAUL

Actually, I need to review the

deposition questions tonight.

Maybe tomorrow?

LETTY

Oh, ok.   Maybe.

10.

PAUL

But I thought if you don't mind,

you could listen and see how I come

across?

LETTY

(beat)

Sure. Of course.

PAUL

Letty, please, I need your full

attention.

LETTY

Let me have it.

BOBBY

My dog ate my turtle, and the shell

went crunch. I brought it for show-

and-tell.

LETTY

I'm sorry about your turtle Bobby,

but you know we only have show-and-

tell on Mondays. Today, we're

scheduled for grammar.

BOBBY

But my mom says I have to throw it

away tonight.

LETTY

Don't even think about it.

11.

LETTY

Class, why don't you...

LETTY

(to class)

You guys pull out your verb sheets

and review them.

RUTH

She says she won't even come if Dad

brings Monica.

LETTY

Mom won't miss your wedding.

She'll come around. I promise she

will.

RUTH

How?

LETTY

I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.

(beat)

A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics

and they'll be ours.

RUTH

Maybe if we had them both to dinner

or something.

LETTY

Maybe.

RUTH

You always throw the best dinner

parties, Letty.

12.

LETTY

Oh, wait a minute, now I see where

you're going.

RUTH

Please, Letty.

LETTY

Mom and Dad? At dinner together?

Are you crazy?

LETTY

Maybe, though. Maybe it would

work. I could throw you an

engagement party maybe.

RUTH

Really?

LETTY

(nodding toward Gail)

You know what, Ruthie? I better get

back to my class, OK?

RUTH

And the party?

LETTY

Yeah, it'll be fun.

RUTH

Thank you so much.

LETTY

Who can come up here and give me a

sentence with a "to be" verb in it?

13.

ZACH

Who was that girl?

LETTY

Come on up, Zach.

LETTY

Neater, Zach.

LETTY

Zach, you know the line by the "a"

has to come straight down or it

looks like an "o."

LETTY

What's wrong, Zach?

L

LETTY

Try again, Zach.    Like that.

LETTY

I don't believe it.    You still

can't do it.

ZACH

I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer?

LETTY

No, it's not OK. You'll never get

to college on OK.

14.

LETTY

It has to be good, Zach.   Do you

understand me?

LETTY

I'm very, very sorry, Zach.

LETTY

You know what, guys? Wednesday's

not a grammar day. It's a collage

day. It's a collage ON THE WALL

day.

LETTY

And, Zach? Zach, I want you to be

in charge of paste.

15.

PAUL

What are you doing?    You're going

to be late.

LETTY

I'm calling in sick.

PAUL

You don't have a fever.

LETTY

I don't feel like going to work

today.

PAUL

Won't it be hard for them to get a

substitute this late?

LETTY

It'll be OK.

PAUL

But what about that math project?

LETTY

Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK

with you or am I committing some

horrible crime?

PAUL

Forget I asked.

LETTY

I'm sorry.

(beat)

I'm just...I'm so tired lately.

PAUL

Maybe you ought to see a doctor.

LETTY

No, it's not like that.

LETTY

It's just I've got those parent

conferences, and I'm supposed to

set up the math program by next

week.

(MORE)

16.

LETTY(cont'd)

And shopping for Ruth's dress and

that, that engagement dinner.

PAUL

You can get out of the dinner.

LETTY

No, I can't. I've already

convinced both Mom and Dad to come.

PAUL

Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.

LETTY

I don't think so.

PAUL

Of course it will. Remember the

big talent show you planned last

year? And what about the Christmas

benefit when Santa canceled at the

last minute? But you still pulled

it off.

LETTY

Yeah.

PAUL

You just need to get more

organized. L

LETTY

Maybe.

PAUL

Let's make a list of the things you

need to do, OK?

MRS. ANDERSON

So at home, we've started our own

little library for Chandra.

17.

MR. ANDERSON

We thought it would be a good

project for her to set up her own

card-catalogue.

LETTY

I see.

MRS. ANDERSON

But what I'm wondering is whether

we should also be spending more

time on her computer skills at

home. What do you think?

LETTY

Well...

MR. ANDERSON

Because we don't want her to get

behind her classmates.

MRS. ANDERSON

And we trust your opinion.

Chandra's always talking about Miss

Mayer.

LETTY

Oh.

MR. ANDERSON

Just the other day she came home

and told us about you taking care

of her bloody nose.

MRS. ANDERSON

And she went on and on about the

collage. That seems very

inventive, Miss Mayer.

MR. ANDERSON

Miss Mayer?

LETTY

What the fuck. It's my job.

CUT TO:

18.

CLERK

More coffee?

LETTY

Hit me.

CLERK

Danish?

LETTY

(rooting through the tray)

No more bear claws left?

CLERK

(to Ruth)

Danish?

RUTH

Oh, no thanks, I'm too excited to

eat.

RUTH

(to Letty)

Where's Mommy?

LETTY

Do you have to call her Mommy?

RUTH

Where's the old bag I sometimes

call Mommy?

19.

LETTY

She said she'd be here at 10.

RUTH

What do you think of this one?

LETTY

I'd have to see it on.

RUTH

Have you been crying?    Your eyes

are all puffy.

LETTY

Things have been kind of stressful

lately.

RUTH

But everything's OK?

LETTY

Yeah, everything's under control.

RUTH

What about the engagement party?

LETTY

Everything's ready for tomorrow

night--except the artillery.

RUTH

Thanks so much for planning it,

Letty. Jake's really looking

forward to it.

LETTY

You better start trying on before

the vultures get all the good ones.

uth twirls around in a taffeta gown as Letty picks up

20.

RUTH

What about this one?

LETTY

(with sisterly pride)

You look beautiful.

RUTH

Really?

LETTY

Truly.

LETTY

Hi, Mom.

RUTH

Look, Mom, I think I've found the

dress.

MRS. MAYER

You look just wonderful, Ruthie.

But I really think you should try

on a few more, don't you?

MRS. MAYER

Has Paul heard about his promotion?

LETTY

No, not yet. But you know Paul.

He's sure to get it.

MRS. MAYER

I don't like the bias cut on that

one.

RUTH

No more. I can't stand to try on

one more dress.

21.

MRS. MAYER

Letty, I think this would be

beautiful on you.

LETTY

Oh no.

MRS. MAYER

Paul could pop the question at any

time.

LETTY

Mom, please.

MRS. MAYER

Especially with a promotion in the

offing.

RUTH

Go on, Letty. I want to see it on

you.

LETTY

(to Ruth)

Do you think I should?

RUTH

Yes, yes.    It'll be fun.

LETTY

Mom?   Mom? Ruth?

CLERK

I think they went over to the next

shop to take a peek at shoes.

22.

MRS. MAYER

I gather he's late as usual.

LETTY

(to her mother)

Can I get you a glass of champagne?

LETTY

Hi, Dad, Monica.   I'm so glad you

could come.

LETTY

Mom, this is Monica.   Monica, my

mother, Martha.

LETTY

Dad, Mother, you've met before,

right?

MR. MAYER

How've you been, Martha?

23.

LETTY

It's mushroom-time, folks.

MR. MAYER

(biting into one)

I like the touch of cilantro. It is

cilantro, isn't it?

LETTY

You can always call it, Dad.

M

ONICA

You must get your cooking skills

from your father, Letty.

LETTY

Ruth's narrowed the dress hunt down

to two, Dad.

MR. MAYER

Tell me about them.

RUTH

One's a silk...

MRS. MAYER

Not in front of Jake, Ruthie.    It's

bad luck.

MONICA

I remember how hard it was looking

for my dress. I must have been to

100 stores.

LETTY

You know what I think we need?

Martinis. How about martinis to

celebrate?

PAUL

Yes.

MRS. MAYER

That might be nice.

24.

MR. MAYER

As long as you have...

LETTY

Puglia olives. Would I forget?

(beat)

A round of martinis coming right

up.

RUTH

How can I help?

LETTY

Paul, can you hand me the olives?

Ruth, I need you to, what was it?

RUTH

What about the souffle?    Has that

gone in?

LETTY

Yeah, I just put it in. But the

squab, I think that needs to be

basted.

PAUL

(to Ruth)

Kind of icy in there.

RUTH

(to Paul)

Thank God we have alcohol.

LETTY

Fuck me.

RUTH

What's the matter?

25.

PAUL

Letty?

PAUL

Let?       L

LETTY

Olives Aux Herbes De Provence.    I

got the wrong kind of olives.

RUTH

What's all the dreck?

LETTY

Sage, rosemary...

(in a sarcastic French

accent)

Les Herbes.

RUTH

It'll be fine.

LETTY

No, no. They've got to be Puglia

olives, packed in a light brine

with a flavor that doesn't

overpower the palate.

LETTY/PAUL/RUTH

You can't leave them alone./Get

back in there./Are you nuts?

JAKE

What do you think of those Lakers?

26.

PAUL

What are you doing?

LETTY

(wild-eyed)

Can you loan me a 20?

PAUL

Sure. Why?

LETTY

I'm going to the store.

PAUL

I think you're overreacting.

RUTH

Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The

souffle...

LETTY

I'll be back before you can say

souffle.

27.

LETTY

I can't find martini olives.     All

you have are black.

STORE CLERK

(without looking up)

Aisle 2A.

OLD LADY

Excuse me, Miss. I can't reach the

cat food.

OLD LADY

And a turkey and giblets, too,

please. She does like her turkey.

LETTY

They're not there. I need the ones

from Puglia.

28.

LETTY

They're the ones that are packed in

brine, but they don't overpower

the, you know, the palate.

STORE CLERK

(without looking up)

Specialty foods. 7B.

LETTY

Where are they?   Where are they?

EMPLOYEE (OS FILTERED)

Manager to 7B. Manager please.

LETTY

Where are they?

MANAGER

What's wrong, Miss?

LETTY

Tell me where they are.

MANAGER

I think you should go now.

LETTY

I need my olives.

29.

MANAGER

It's time to leave.

MANAGER

Call security. Where's security,

please?

LETTY

Fucking olives. Fucking, fucking

olives.

LETTY

No, no, no. Go away.

MANAGER

(yelling)

Call police. Now.

30.

FADE OUT:

MICHAEL

Miss Mayer? Miss Mayer?

MICHAEL

I know you've had a rough night,

but I have a few questions for you,

Miss Mayer, or Letitia.

MICHAEL

Do you mind if I call you Letitia?

LETTY

Letty.

MICHAEL

(consulting his notes)

First off, Letty, can you tell me

where you are?

LETTY

I answered these questions last

night.

31.

MICHAEL

I know this can be a real drag, but

the attending physician on day

shift is required to do his own

prelim exam when a patient is

admitted during the night.

LETTY

Hillview Psychiatric Hospital.

MICHAEL

Great. Now, Letty, I'd like you to

remember three items. I'm going to

ask you to repeat them in just a

few minutes. They are chair, cup

and ball. Did you get that?

MICHAEL

OK, let's subtract 6 from a

succession of numbers starting with

91.

LETTY

85.

MICHAEL

And 85 minus 6?

LETTY

59.

LETTY

No, 79. Sorry, this makes me

nervous.

MICHAEL

It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind

of thing.

MICHAEL

Now the three things I asked you to

remember.

LETTY

Chair, cup and ball.

32.

MICHAEL

Terrific.

MICHAEL

Let me shift gears here a minute...

(beat)

Do you ever hear voices that other

people don't hear or see things

they don't?

LETTY

No.

MICHAEL

What about patterns? Do you find

yourself checking and re-checking

locks? Or washing your hands over

and over again?

MICHAEL

How about arranging your

possessions in a certain way?

MICHAEL

Yes?   Go right ahead.

LETTY

Sometimes my food, and my clothes,

and my underwear.

MICHAEL

How do you sort it--by lace and

cotton?

LETTY

By color.

MICHAEL

What if it's got a pattern?

LETTY

Is this really important? Because

I don't think it's a problem.

33.

MICHAEL

I see.

(looking at his notes)

How long has it been since you've

done something you've enjoyed,

Letty?

LETTY

(beat)

A while, I guess.

MICHAEL

That must be really difficult.

MICHAEL

Hey, it'll be OK.   We'll make sure

of that.

MICHAEL

For now, why don't you just take it

easy while I confer with my

colleagues. A nurse should be in

shortly.

DR. EMLEE

Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and

I have some questions to ask you...

LETTY

I did this already.

DR. EMLEE

It's hospital policy...

LETTY

To be interviewed every hour?

DR. EMLEE

I'm the only doctor making rounds

this morning.

34.

LETTY

Well, I don't have hallucinations.

Honest.

DR. EMLEE

This doctor, was he tall, with dark

hair?

LETTY

Yeah, and a dimple.

DR. EMLEE

I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.

LETTY

Psychologist, therapist, whatever.

DR. EMLEE

Patient.

LETTY

What?

DR. EMLEE

Michael, the man who came to see

you, is a patient.

LETTY

What kind of place is this?

DR. EMLEE

I apologize for the inconvenience,

but I must ask you some...

LETTY

I want to see my mother

immediately.

DR. EMLEE

We discourage family visits for the

first 48 hours after an emotional

trauma like the kind you've

experienced.

LETTY

I don't think you understand.    I

won't wait.

35.

DR. EMLEE

You'll have to. Your family agreed

to the conditions not to see you

when they admitted you to Hillview,

Letitia.

(beat)

We can talk about how that makes

you feel, but we can't change the

rules.

DR. EMLEE

Dr. Stone's evaluation from last

night indicates you're experiencing

a great deal of anxiety, probably

related to depression...

DR. EMLEE

We need to talk about starting you

on drug therapy. Most depressive

personalities benefit from a drug

like Prozac or maybe Zoloft...

JOHN

I'm in for 5 for manic depressive.

THOMAS

I'll go with that as well.

36.

MARIE

(to John and Thomas)

You two always bet manic

depressive.

(

to Michael)

Tell me more about the guard she

strangled.

MICHAEL

No, just hit in the head.

JOHN

What about voices?    Does she hear

voices?

MICHAEL

Not that she admits to.

MARIE

Is she a washer?

MICHAEL

No, but she is exceptionally

organized.

THOMAS

How organized?

MICHAEL

She arranges her underwear by

color.

MICHAEL

Mrs. Hallstrom, you want in?

MRS. HALLSTROM

All tapped out.

MICHAEL

I'll float you.

MARIE

(to Michael)

It's been weeks since she played.

MICHAEL

What about you, Marie?

37.

MARIE

(handing Michael a $20

bill)

I'll say major depression

complicated by obsessive compulsive

disorder.

(beat)

And could I get my change in ones?

NURSE GATES

Treatment schedules are posted on

the bulletin board. Dinner at 6,

lights out at 10 and no

fraternizing between patients.

NURSE GATES

(pointing as she goes)

That's the rec room. We show

movies there on Wednesdays and

Fridays...And this is the dining

hall.

LETTY

I'm really not that hungry.

NURSE GATES

Just eat whatever you want. This

will give you a chance to meet some

people.

LETTY

You know, my mom's coming to get me

tomorrow. I'll be leaving.

NURSE GATES

It's OK, Letty. I'll be right here

with you.

38.

THOMAS

So I said to my publisher this

afternoon, I said, don't you even--

NURSE GATES

(interrupts)

Hi, gang. I want to introduce you

to Letty.

(to Letty)

Letty, this is Mrs. Hallstrom and

Marie, and John and Thomas.

THOMAS

(to Letty)

Just discussing my pesky publisher.

May I ask what you do when you're

not vacationing?

MARIE

(to Thomas)

Let the poor girl get some food,

for Heaven's sake.

LETTY

I'm a teacher.

THOMAS

As you may have gathered, I'm a

writer.

THOMAS

I don't like to say novelist. That

sounds a little grandiose, but I am

on my third novel and...

NURSE GATES

Excuse me for interrupting, Thomas,

but we really should get some

food...

MICHAEL

(to patients)

Now I'm going to say that the card

you picked was the Ace of Spades.

39.

NURSE GATES

Michael.

NURSE GATES

Michael, this is Letty.      She just

arrived yesterday.

LETTY

We've met.

(to Michael)

I missed you during rounds this

morning.

NURSE GATES

(to Michael)

This doctor thing has got to stop.

M

RS. MAYER

I'm here, Sweetheart.      I'm here.

It's going to be OK.

LETTY

I'm sorry.     I'm so sorry.

MRS. MAYER

Oh, Letty, what happened?

LETTY

Mom, I was there, and I just, I was

so...

(MORE)

40.

LETTY(cont'd)

They didn't have the olives, and I,

I got so upset. I don't know how it

happened.

MRS. MAYER

I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he

says...

LETTY

I'm so glad to see you. You can't

believe the people in here.

They've got patients posing as

doctors...

MRS. MAYER

Everyone says it's the best

facility in the area for this sort

of thing.

LETTY

I just want to go home.   Can we go

home now?

MRS. MAYER

I think the best thing for you

right now is to stay here and get

well.

LETTY

Maybe I should talk about this with

Ruth, or Paul.

MRS. MAYER

We all agree with the doctor, Dear.

He thinks it's safer for you to

stay here for a while.

LETTY

You all really think I need to be

here?

MRS. MAYER

Yes.

LETTY

But what about Beast?   Who'll...?

MRS. MAYER

Ruth's already taken him home.

41.

LETTY

And my class. It'll be hard to

find a good substitute. And what

about my math program?

MRS. MAYER

Paul said he'd call the school.

(beat)

And your father thinks he's

convinced the guard not to press

charges as long as you get help.

LETTY

Charges?

MRS. MAYER

For his injuries. I guess you...I

guess he got hit in the head.

MRS. MAYER

I packed up some of your clothes,

and I can bring whatever else you

need.

LETTY

Mom, no, please don't go.    Please.

MRS. MAYER

I'll see you soon.

LETTY

Tomorrow?

MRS. MAYER

As soon as Dr. Emlee says.

42.

MICHAEL (O.S.)

Four people bet OCD and clinical

depression so I split the pool.

JOHN (O.S.)

Yeah, her diagnosis was no mystery.

MARIE

Especially the OCD.

JOHN (O.S.)

Fuck, I mean, anyone who color-

codes her panties has big problems.

MICHAEL

Hey there. They're showing

"Groundhog Day" if you...

LETTY

You took bets on my diagnosis?

MICHAEL

It's no big deal.   We all compare.

LETTY

(voice rising)

W

ho do you think you are?

MICHAEL

Don't take it personally.

43.

LETTY

You have no right, no right to take

the worst thing that's ever

happened to me and make it into

some kind of game.

MICHAEL

Stop acting like you're someone

special. You're just like the rest

of us.

LETTY

I'm not the one who's masquerading

as a doctor. I'm not the one

who's, who's...

JOHN

(to Letty)

He's schizophrenic.

LETTY

I'm not the one who's

schizophrenic. I don't see people

who aren't there or run around

PATIENTS

Go, Girl!/ Come on, Michael.

MICHAEL

Oh, no, you're perfectly sane.

That's why you're here.

LETTY

Go fuck yourself.

r. Emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding

MRS. HALLSTROM

I can't stop thinking about the

things I did wrong when my daughter

was little.

DR. EMLEE

And how's that make you feel?

MRS. HALLSTROM

I just feel like sleeping.    All the

time.

THOMAS

Hell's bells, you can count me in

on that. I haven't had enough Z's

since I ran those sleep disorder

experiments at Stanford back in the

70s.

MARIE

We really miss doing things with

you, Mrs. Hallstrom.

MRS. HALLSTROM

Maybe when I hit my manic phase

again.

JOHN

I've noticed Letty doesn't much

like to do things with us.

45.

LETTY

Oh, no. Of course I do.

JOHN

Then why are you so defensive?

MICHAEL

(to John)

I don't think we need to sacrifice

Letty to pep up a slow session.

JOHN

(to Michael)

You're the one who told everyone

about her panties.

DR. EMLEE

Maybe you'd like to share some of

your feelings about OCD or

depression with us, Letty.

LETTY

Do we have to talk about this?

DR. EMLEE

I think in the spirit of group

therapy, it's beneficial for each

of us to open ourselves up to the

others.

DR. EMLEE

You never know, Letty, how the

person sitting next to you may be

able to shed light on one of your

problems...

46.

DR. EMLEE

...by revealing something that's

going on in his or her own life.

DR. EMLEE

(responding to her smile)

There, now, I knew you'd feel

better once we discussed group

process. Let's talk a little about

your OCD.

M

ICHAEL

Looking for a romance?

LETTY

Excuse me?

MICHAEL

What are you looking to read?

LETTY

Anything interesting.

MICHAEL

This is good.

LETTY

But you're checking it out.

MICHAEL

I've already checked it out 17

times.

LETTY

You keep the book.   I'm looking for

Emily Dickinson.

47.

MICHAEL

Hey, if you take the magic book,

I'll feel like maybe you accept my

apology and don't hate me anymore.

LETTY

I haven't heard an apology.

MICHAEL

I'm really sorry I hurt your

feelings. I got a little carried

away. Can you ever forgive me?

MICHAEL

Mrs. Hallstrom, I'm pretty sure you

could use that.

MICHAEL

Now, don't you have a gin rummy,

Mrs. Hallstrom?

(beat)

Go ahead, now, just lay those cards

down.

MICHAEL

Hot damn. Gin rummy. I told you

so. You're three games up on me.

48.

PAUL

It's prettier here than I thought

it would be.

LETTY

Yeah, I guess it's all right.

PAUL

Are you all right?

LETTY

That's a big question.

PAUL

I hope it wasn't something I did.

LETTY

Something you did?

PAUL

That put you in here.

LETTY

Of course not, no.

(beat)

Is that why you're here?

PAUL

I think we need to talk about some

things.

LETTY

Yes, I suppose so.

PAUL

This has been really difficult,

this whole thing.

(MORE)

49.

PAUL(cont'd)

These past few weeks, it's made me

really go back and examine our

whole relationship.

(beat)

I mean, we've been going out for

four years, and it hasn't always

been so easy.

LETTY

No.

PAUL

Especially this last year.

LETTY

(softly)

Especially now.

PAUL

So, I've been thinking a lot...

LETTY

I have too, Paul.

PAUL

I talked to Ruth a little bit, and

I think it's about time...

LETTY

I know. We can't just keep going

through the motions.

PAUL

Exactly. It's time to make

decisions.

LETTY

You don't have to say anything

else. I've known for a while that

this was coming.

PAUL

I just wish we'd done it sooner.

PAUL

Will you marry me?

50.

PAUL

I had to smuggle it in here. I

guess you're not really supposed to

have jewelry.

LETTY

(by rote)

Or be up past ten or fraternize

with other patients.

PAUL

I hope you like it. It's a Marquis

cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with

emeralds around it, but this was

simpler, more classic in its lines.

(beat)

L

Letty?

LETTY

It's, it's really nice, Paul.

PAUL

You can take it back and we can

have one custom made if you want.

LETTY

No, you've done a perfect job.

PAUL

So, what do you say, Let?

LETTY

Do you think, really, that it's OK

to get engaged when I'm in here?

PAUL

Sure. We'll save the formal

announcement for when you're out. I

already told your mother. I hope

you don't mind.

LETTY

No, no.

PAUL

So will you?

LETTY

(working up a smile)

Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.

51.

MICHAEL

You missed out on some great

broccoli florets at dinner.

LETTY

I wasn't hungry.

MICHAEL

John even managed to lob a load of

mashed potatoes into Mrs.

Hallstrom's milk.

LETTY

(smiling)

Finally. I was getting tired of

watching him try every night.

MICHAEL

Was it bad news--the visit from

Peter?

LETTY

Paul.

MICHAEL

He looked pretty serious.

LETTY

He asked me to marry him.

MICHAEL

Very romantic setting.

LETTY

It was romantic.   He's very

romantic.

MICHAEL

So are you engaged, or what?

52.

LETTY

What have you done with the ring?

MICHAEL

It's magic.

LETTY

This isn't funny.   Paul would kill

me.

MICHAEL

Guess which hand.

LETTY

Enough with the abracadabra.

MICHAEL

Guess.

LETTY

T

he left one.

MICHAEL

(to audience)

The fair maiden guesses

incorrectly. Should we give her

one more try?

(to Letty)

The audience says one more try.

What guess you now?

LETTY

The right one.

LETTY

Come on, Michael.

MICHAEL

With this ring, I thee...

53.

LETTY

Really, this isn't funny.

MICHAEL

OK, OK, I'll give it back.

MICHAEL

For a price.

LETTY

Good God.

MICHAEL

A small price.

LETTY

I won't do your portion of kitchen

cleanup.

MICHAEL

No.

LETTY

And I'm not covering for you when

you sneak out to call Dominos.

MICHAEL

I want a kiss.

LETTY

Get serious.

MICHAEL

I'm serious.

LETTY

(softly)

Everything's a joke with you.

54.

MICHAEL

Here.

LETTY

The medicine's still bothering me.

It feels like I have cotton wrapped

around my brain.

DR. EMLEE

We'll see about adjusting the

dosage if that doesn't clear in the

next (week.

beat)

How are other things going?

LETTY

I think I've told you all the news.

Let's see--the engagement. Oh, and

my sister's coming to visit me, and

they say my cat misses me.

DR. EMLEE

The question, Letty, is how are you

feeling?

LETTY

I miss Beast a lot, too.

INTERCOM

Hark the Herald Angels sing...

NURSE GATES

What are you doing?

MICHAEL

(yelling)

Not me.

MRS. HALLSTROM

Sorry, sorry. Candy canes are out

of season.

NURSE GATES

Mrs. Hallstrom?

NURSE GATES

Come on. Come with me, Mrs.

Hallstrom.

MARIE

Hot boxers.

56.

LETTY

I can't believe you finally gave me

the shirt.

RUTH

Loaned you. And it's only 'til you

get out of here.

LETTY

That settles it. I'm never leaving.

RUTH

I can hardly wait 'til you're free.

Planning the wedding without you

has been a disaster.

LETTY

You're slowing.

RUTH

(picking up the pace)

Mom and I fought for 20 minutes

over whether we should go with ecru

invitations or brilliant white.

RUTH

What do you think?

LETTY

Ecru.

RUTH

And then the gold scroll or the

black Romanesque print?

LETTY

Do we have to talk wedding details?

57.

RUTH

Oh, no, of course not.

LETTY

I mean, you can always send me

fabric samples to look at or

pictures of dresses. But, it's

been so long since we've seen each

other.

RUTH

Of course. You're right. Besides,

we should be talking about your

engagement.

LETTY

Tell me more about Beast beating up

that other cat.

RUTH

Bloody furry mess, like I said.

(beat)

Aren't you so excited about Paul?

(

beat)

Letty?

RUTH

What's going on with you, Letty?

LETTY

Ruthie, do you ever wonder if

you'll meet someone else...someone

besides Jake?

RUTH

What's his name, Letty?

LETTY

I didn't say...

RUTH

Don't even try.    What's his name?

58.

NURSE GATES

Lights out, Letty.

LETTY

We're supposed to be asleep.

MICHAEL

Exactly.

LETTY

We'll get caught.

MICHAEL

No rounds for another three hours.

MICHAEL

Nervous? Scared? Worried you're

not fit for a caper of epic

proportions?

L

LETTY

Don't be ridiculous.

MICHAEL

Rendezvous at the closet in 30.

59.

NURSE GATES

Letty, you should be in bed.

LETTY

There's a spider in my room.

NURSE GATES

Yeah?

LETTY

It's got a green dot on its back.

I can't go to sleep with it

watching me.

NURSE GATES

Sounds awful. I guess we better

check it out.

MICHAEL

Extra large pepperoni and

mushrooms.

And two cokes.

Glenfield. Off the Fourth Street

exit.

LETTY

It had this red spot on its back.

NURSE GATES

Green spot.

LETTY

Mottled really.   Green and red.

NURSE GATES

I don't know why you feel you have

to lie, Letty.

LETTY

Lie?

NURSE GATES

If you feel lonely, or need to

talk, all you have to do is say so.

LETTY

To talk?

(beat)

Well, OK, that might be good.

N

URSE GATES

I understand you just got engaged.

Maybe that's where we should start.

CUT TO:

JIM

I'm afraid I can't let you take

that in without the proper invoice.

MICHAEL

It's a pizza.

JIM

All the same, rules are rules.

61.

MICHAEL

You don't understand. This is a

very important, very special,

morale-boosting pizza.

JIM

What I understand is how low morale

gets when you're posted at a guard

station all night, Val.

CUT TO:

LETTY

I don't mean to go on and on like

this.

NURSE GATES

It's OK.   It's good to let it out.

NURSE GATES

Did you ever tell Paul how you

felt?

LETTY

He was graduating from law school,

and he just assumed I was OK with

dropping out.

(beat)

We never really talked about it.

But I know he was disappointed in

me.

CUT TO:

62.

UT TO:

LETTY

I mean I'm just not sure I want the

same things now that I did even a

month ago.

LETTY

Is that so wrong?

You can only do what feels best to

you now.

LETTY

I guess so. I think that's right.

You've been so great. I just feel

Shhh. They're coming to the cubic

MICHAEL

I like those sapphire earrings

myself.

MRS. HALLSTROM

S

imulated sapphires. I bet my

daughter would love those, too.

MARIE

Jesus...just get a room.

65.

DR. EMLEE

I think it's a problem that you

never told me about Michael. I had

to hear it from another patient.

LETTY

I couldn't really say anything

because of that fraternizing rule.

DR. EMLEE

Well, Letty, this does present a

liability issue for the hospital.

LETTY

I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I

can take care of myself.

D

R. EMLEE

What about Michael? Do you know

the extent of his...

LETTY

I know Michael's a schizophrenic,

and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic-

depressive, and John Lockyer has

episodes of psychosis, and I heard

a rumor that you suffer from

delusions of grandeur.

DR. EMLEE

Go ahead and put the guard back up,

Letty. But you need to know what

you're dealing with.

LETTY

I don't need a lecture.   I care

about Michael.

DR. EMLEE

Then that's even more reason to

listen. Look, schizophrenics tend

to withdraw from reality. They

experience emotional disturbances

that result in personality changes.

(MORE)

66.

DR. EMLEE(cont'd)

(beat)

You could be lying next to Michael

in bed one night, and he could have

a hallucination, or a delusion. It

might happen when you're driving

or...

LETTY

Look, I know he's almost through

with treatment here. And, he's on

medication.

DR. EMLEE

Drugs can help suppress symptoms.

But lots of patients stop taking

them when they're on their own

because the side effects are so

harsh.

(beat)

And, Michael's condition is often

worsened by periods of stress. He's

been in and out of...

LETTY

I don't want to hear anymore.

DR. EMLEE

I'd like you to promise you won't

carry on a relationship with

Michael. Otherwise, I'll consider

moving one of you to another ward.

LETTY

First you tell me to do what I want

to, then you tell me to stop.

DR. EMLEE

All I want you to do is think about

what's best for you. Really think

about it.

MICHAEL

A daisy for the lady.

LETTY

The lady knows this is a dandelion.

MICHAEL

A rose is a rose.

67.

LETTY

Thanks.    Where've you been all day?

MICHAEL

Back-to-back sessions with the

shrink.

LETTY

Sounds important.

MICHAEL

I'm not allowed to see you anymore.

LETTY

Really?    Me too.

MICHAEL

I had to sneak by the guards to get

here. They say you're highly

unstable, have a depressive

personality, and may hold back my

own recovery.

LETTY

Wow.    I'm bad news.

MICHAEL

What's my rap?

LETTY

Schizophrenic recidivism marked by

hallucinations and paranoid

delusions.

MICHAEL

Fuck.    That's all true.

MICHAEL

Really, though. My thoughts go

haywire sometimes.

LETTY

What are the delusions like?

MICHAEL

I think people are after me, crap

like that.

(beat)

(MORE)

68.

MICHAEL(cont'd)

When I was 18, my mom came home and

found me sitting naked on the

kitchen table. I thought I was God.

MICHAEL

Shocking, huh?

LETTY

Sure. But I took out a whole

grocery store.

MICHAEL

I wish I could have seen that.

LETTY

I'm starting to think that

everyone's crazy to some extent.

MICHAEL

M

y Grandma Rosa says that some

trees get planted in rich top soil,

and they grow right up to the sun,

tall and straight. Other trees,

they start as seeds in the crevices

between rocks so they have to twist

and bend to reach the light.

(beat)

But even though they end up

crooked, they're still trees, just

like the straight ones.

MICHAEL

(with a start)

Why in the world did you let me

start talking in metaphors? That's

no way for us to break up.

LETTY

Break up?    They wish.

DELIVERY MAN

I need a signature, please.

NURSE GATES

What is all this stuff?

DELIVERY MAN

I just deliver it, Ma'am.

NURSE GATES

Well, who exactly is it for?

DELIVERY MAN

A Mrs. Eunice Hallstrom.

NURSE GATES

I see. Can you wait a moment?

DR. EMLEE

But how does that make you feel,

John, what Letty said about your

hostility?

JOHN

She doesn't know what the hell

she's talking about.

NURSE GATES

I'm sorry, Doctor. I just need a

moment with Mrs. Hallstrom.

DR. EMLEE

What seems to be the problem?

NURSE GATES

They say she ordered...Mrs.

Hallstrom, did you order a bunch of

stuff, because Federal Express...

rs. Hallstrom's face glows.

70.

MRS. HALLSTROM

It's here, everyone. Come along.

It's here.

DR. EMLEE

Oh, fine, let's see.

MRS. HALLSTROM

For you, John. And, Letty. And,

Michael, I know you'll love these.

DR. EMLEE

Mrs. Hallstrom, you ordered all

this?

JOHN

(to Mrs. Hallstrom)

Thomas got a crown and all I got

was a lousy bracelet?

DR. EMLEE

You must have spent thousands of

dollars.

MRS. HALLSTROM

Don't worry, Doctor, I didn't

forget you.

DR. EMLEE

Mrs. Hallstrom, you can't possibly

afford to pay for this. It must go

back.

71.

MRS. HALLSTROM

Why, no, Doctor. It can't. Most

of it's for my daughter, Lily.

She's coming to family day

tomorrow...all the way from

Cleveland with my grandson.

(beat)

You can't be taking away their

"Welcome to California" presents.

DR. EMLEE

It's going back. We'll contact the

company this afternoon.

(to patients)

Take the jewelry off, please.

M

RS. HALLSTROM

But I have to keep something for my

daughter.

DR. EMLEE

Let's go back to group, and discuss

it there. Back to group, everyone.

DR. EMLEE

(to Nurse Gates)

Increase her lithium to 600

milligrams, three times a day. Oh,

and Nurse, let's see about

canceling the cable.

NURSE GATES

Your mother's in the rec room,

Letty.

72.

MRS. MAYER

It's so good to see you,

Sweetheart.

LETTY

You too, Mom.

MRS. MAYER

You're looking good.    A little

thin, but good.

MRS. MAYER

Thanks so much for doing this.

Ruthie and Jake are up to a million

things. And I just can't decide.

LETTY

Which flowers did you order?

MRS. MAYER

We haven't. I wanted to talk that

over with you, too.

LETTY

Oh, OK, well, better to choose the

table cloths first anyway.

MRS. MAYER

I

was thinking either the peach

moire or cream damask.

LETTY

This would complement the blue in

the bride's maids' dresses. Look.

MRS. MAYER

Where's your ring, Sweetheart?

73.

LETTY

We aren't allowed to wear jewelry

in here, Mom.

MRS. MAYER

Just think, pretty soon, we'll be

doing all these wedding

preparations for you.

(beat)

Of course, if that's what you still

want. Ruthie told me some silly

story about a crush on some boy

here.

LETTY

I haven't had a crush since I was

12.

MRS. MAYER

When did you start smoking?

LETTY

I'll put it out if it bothers you.

MRS. MAYER

The puckering, dear. It doesn't

seem so now, but in time, it will

cause wrinkles around the mouth.

MRS. MAYER

You know, your life isn't about

being in a mental hospital.

LETTY

What?

MRS. MAYER

I hear this Michael fellow is

schizophrenic.

LETTY

Mom, please.

MRS. MAYER

Don't forget that Paul's a

promising young attorney who loves

you very much...

74.

LETTY

Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul,

I'll dump him. If I want to screw

Michael or live with him or marry

him, then I'll do that.

MRS. MAYER

(whispering)

I'm only looking out for you.

LETTY

(yelling)

And if I want to smoke, I'll

fucking smoke.

THOMAS

Mrs. Mayer, I'm sorry but I

couldn't help overhearing. I just

wanted to say, not that it's any of

my business...

MRS. MAYER

Yes?

THOMAS

I think, really, I think I'd go

with the cream damask.

NURSE GATES

It's OK to be upset.

MRS. HALLSTROM

Upset? Why of course not. My

goodness, no. I'm sure she just

got hung up.

75.

MICHAEL

Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join

my family for dinner. You'll love

my Grandma Rosa.

MRS. HALLSTROM

That's so sweet, Michael. But,

really, I've so many things to do.

LETTY

If you change your mind, we'll be

in the dining hall.

ROSA

(to Letty)

What do you need now?

(to Mr. Santucci)

Send down the lamb. This girl's as

thin as a stick.

LETTY

Oh, no.   I'm stuffed.

ROSA

Tell her to eat, Frank.

MR. SANTUCCI

Mangia.   Mangia.

MICHAEL

(whispering to Letty)

You can't turn down Grandma Rosa's

lamb.

ROSA

Or my eggplant. I make the best

eggplant in L.A. The mozzarella I

use, it's so fresh it sweats.

MRS. SANTUCCI

Michael says you're a teacher.

LETTY

I was. I'm hoping I'll still have

a job when I get out.

LETTY

What's she doing?

MRS. HALLSTROM

Rosa, Rosa, you must have this,

Rosa.

ROSA

Grazie.

MICHAEL

Mrs. Hallstrom, join us. Please.

MRS. HALLSTROM

Merry Christmas to all. Ho, ho,

ho, ho.

Michael, we've got to stop her.

MRS. HALLSTROM

No way.

Why?

MICHAEL

My dad used to take me there when I

was little. It's totally quiet.

And you can see the ocean for

miles.

LETTY

What else would you do?

78.

MICHAEL

I'd like to drink a bottle of red

wine with you and then make love to

you and spend the whole night

together. And we'd get up in the

morning and spend hours lounging

around and reading the paper.

LETTY

And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed

from the can.

MICHAEL

How can you even mention Spaghetti-

O's after eating Grandma Rosa's

dinner tonight?

LETTY

I have a terrible confession.

Tell the doctor.

Then it's over.

It's a good thing my family loves

Where will you live upon release?

JOHN

Live?

JUDGE MILTON

Where do you plan to reside, Mr.

Lockyer?

JOHN

JUDGE MILTON

Is your mother here today?

JOHN

That's the bitch. That cock-

sucking bitch. She put me here.

She did. She's the Satan that did

this all.

JUDGE MILTON

The records indicate no major

episodes in the past four months.

And it seems you have the support

of the staff.

MICHAEL

Yes, Sir.

JUDGE MILTON

But I see you've been in and out of

the hospital more than ten times.

MICHAEL

Eleven, Your Honor.   But I'm on a

new medication now.

JUDGE MILTON

Do you feel ready to re-enter the

world?

MICHAEL

Yes, Sir. My family is    prepared to

support me until I find   a job.

They've already located   an

apartment for me that's   very near

them.

JUDGE MILTON

Very well, then. By order of the

court, you are released. I wish

you good luck.

I don't mean to hurt you.    I know

this is a terrible thing.    And I

Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me?

Letty, it's natural to be nervous.

But we're going to work through our

problems.

LETTY

I've met someone else.

PAUL

Who?

LETTY

It doesn't matter who.

83.

PAUL

Have you been seeing another

teacher?

LETTY

No.

PAUL

It's a doctor, isn't it? That's

unethical. I'll have him rung up

on malpractice charges so fast his

head will spin.

LETTY

He's a patient here.

PAUL

Of all the crazy things. I

understood when you dropped out of

law school. And during this whole

mess, I've tried to be supportive.

But, really, Letty, what can you be

thinking?

LETTY

I love him.

PAUL

You're going to throw away our life

together for some shared experience

with a looney-tune that you

misguidedly think is love?

LETTY

Here's the ring.

PAUL

No way. You keep the ring.     You'll

come to your senses.

LETTY

I've made my decision, Paul.

PAUL

You keep it, Letty. This is not

over. Our life is not over.

84.

MICHAEL

How's it hanging, Paul?

MICHAEL

Visitor for Ms. Mayer.

LETTY

Well?        M

ICHAEL

Home free.

NURSE

Letty, Michael, you have about five

minutes until visiting hours end.

LETTY

Tell me all.

MICHAEL

I was brilliant, or at least

boringly sane.

LETTY

So there were no problems?

MICHAEL

Not a one.

LETTY

And did you go to the mission?

MICHAEL

No, you goof, I came to see you.

LETTY

Just checking.

85.

MICHAEL

I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the

dirty deed?

LETTY

Yeah.

MICHAEL

So, it's over?

LETTY

All over.

(beat)

Did you see your new apartment?

MICHAEL

One bedroom, second floor, no view.

LETTY

Furnished?

MICHAEL

No, I need some serious household

advice.

LETTY

First off, you'll need to go to

Target. And, let's see, what

should you buy?

MICHAEL

I better make a list.

LETTY

List schmist. You'll remember.

THOMAS

Hit me.

THOMAS

I'm over.

86.

NURSE GATES

(to Jamie)

Dr. Stone will ask you some

questions, and then we'll get you

settled.

NURSE GATES

(to Letty/Bill)

Lights out in 15, Guys.

M

ARIE

Wow, that first night is hard.

LETTY

It's going to be a difficult few

weeks for him.

THOMAS

It really makes you think.

LETTY

It really does.

MARIE

I'll put in 5 that it's a straight

diagnosis of depressive

personality.

LETTY

Are you kidding? With those glazed

eyes? I'm willing to bet 10 there

was some break with reality going

on there. Psychosis. Without a

doubt, psychosis.

LETTY

But what I really can't believe is

that I'm starting to actually miss

work.

87.

DR. EMLEE

Have you been in contact with the

principal about your job?

LETTY

I thought about calling, but I want

to wait until I know when I'll be

out.

DR. EMLEE

Then, you should call.

LETTY

What?

DR. EMLEE

I think it's about that time,

Letty. The charges against you

have been dropped, the drugs have

evened out and you seem to be

dealing with your life quite well.

LETTY

Are you saying I'm through with

therapy?

DR. EMLEE

Let's not be hasty.

(beat)

I'm saying we should plan a release

date for early next week.

CUT TO:

ichael takes several deep breaths. With trepidation in his

88.

MRS. MAYER

Must you walk so quickly?

LETTY

It's good exercise, Mom.

MRS. MAYER

I've got 26 years on you. If we

could just slow down, we could talk

so much easier.

MRS. MAYER

I'm so thankful you'll be leaving

next week. If you want me to pick

you up, I will.

LETTY

I've already made arrangements.

MRS. MAYER

Ruthie mentioned that Michael might

be coming for you.

LETTY

Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but

you're not allowed to mention

Michael.

MRS. MAYER

Not even if it's something

positive?

LETTY

Nyet.   That's the condition.

MRS. MAYER

Have you spoken to Paul at all?

89.

LETTY

One more and you're out.

MRS. MAYER

Honestly, Letty.

LETTY

A deal's a deal.

MRS. MAYER

Have you heard the figure on how

much Queen Elizabeth's going to pay

in taxes this year?

LETTY

I knew you had it in you.

DR. EMLEE

So, we'll meet every Tuesday and

Friday. And if you have any kind

of emergency, you can page me.

LETTY

OK, good. That's good. Thanks an

awful lot for everything, and for

coming down here to see me off.

DR. EMLEE

It was just a little going-away

gesture.

LETTY

I have a going-away gesture for

you, too.

DR. EMLEE

Oh?

90.

LETTY

I'll miss you, Mrs. Hallstrom.

NURSE GATES

Take care, Letty. And, let me know

if you need help with any spiders.

LETTY

You know I will.       Thanks for

everything.

MICHAEL

See you later, guys.

MICHAEL

Aren't you supposed to throw a

bouquet or something?

LETTY

Aren't you ever quiet?

MICHAEL

Where to?

LETTY

I've heard the mission in Santa

Barbara is the place to go.

91.

MICHAEL

This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.

LETTY

Open up.    I want to see.

MICHAEL

Close your eyes.

MICHAEL

OK.    Open them.

LETTY

Wow.

MICHAEL

You like it?

LETTY

I love the pillows.

MICHAEL

Throw pillows, Letty. The sales

lady said they're the latest thing.

LETTY

Very trendy. Let's see the rest.

LETTY

It's TV heaven.

92.

MICHAEL

I was tired of watching what

everyone else wants to watch. Now

we can watch two shows at once.

LETTY

Let's try out the bed.

MICHAEL

You've got to see the kitchen

first.

MICHAEL

Do you like it?

LETTY

I love your apartment.

MICHAEL

Really?

LETTY

You'll never get rid of me.

LETTY

What do you say we go out to dinner

to celebrate?

MICHAEL

Out? Are you kidding?     I've got

all the fixings here.

93.

LETTY

How can you not like the Top 10

List?

MICHAEL

I like it.     But Headlines are

better.

LETTY

You're so wrong.

MICHAEL

Hey.

LETTY

It's sex time.

MICHAEL

I think it's my turn.

LETTY

Did I get spaghetti sauce on my

face?

MICHAEL

No.

LETTY

Michael.

MICHAEL

Shhhh.

94.

DISSOLVE TO:

MICHAEL

Letty?   Rise and shine.

LETTY'S POV:

BACK TO SCENE:

LETTY

Not yet.

MICHAEL

I'll be forced to tickle you.

L

LETTY

Go away.

MICHAEL

How about this? It's 10:30.

LETTY

I'm supposed to meet the principal

in half an hour.

95.

MICHAEL

I'll see you tonight.

LETTY

Good luck.

MICHAEL

You, too. Kick ass today.

LETTY

My apartment tonight.   You can meet

Beast.

MICHAEL

Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?

LETTY

Yeah?

MICHAEL

(yelling)

You've got one hell of a great

body.

PRINCIPAL GAIL

I didn't have any choice but to

include the parents' letters in

your file.

96.

LETTY

Well, I understand.     I know my

behavior was poor.

PRINCIPAL GAIL

So, in light of how the parents

feel, and the fact the students are

doing so well with the substitute,

I don't think I can put you back in

the classroom just yet.

LETTY

Look, Gail, I've been a good

teacher.

PRINCIPAL GAIL

I know, Letty. But the incident

with Zach was frightening for the

children.

(beat)

Now if you'd come to me, explained

what was going on...

LETTY

Believe me, I wish I'd understood

what was going on. I've worked

really hard to get better.

P

RINCIPAL GAIL

I'm glad you're doing well.

LETTY

I've already thought about how to

tell the kids where I was.

LETTY

And I'd like to send the parents

this letter of explanation. With

your support, I think they can

accept me.

PRINCIPAL GAIL

It's a very nice letter. But I

have to go with what's best for the

students.

LETTY

What does that mean?

97.

PRINCIPAL GAIL

I need someone to work on budget

projections.

LETTY

Office work?

PRINCIPAL GAIL

Or, of course, you could take a

sabbatical the rest of the year.

MR. SMYTHE

It's not that we're doubting your

intelligence, Mr. Santucci. But

your work history shows so many

interruptions.

MICHAEL

I know, but as I said...

MR. SMYTHE

I appreciate your candor about your

illness, but my bosses are

concerned.

MICHAEL

I can do the job.

MR. SMYTHE

Between you and me, my uncle, he

has some mental problems, and I

know what you're going through. If

it were up to me, I'd hire you.

MICHAEL

Right.   Thanks for your help.

98.

LETTY

It's open.

MICHAEL

Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.

LETTY

Thanks.

M

ICHAEL

This must be Beast.

LETTY

That's Mr. Beast to you.

MICHAEL

How was your day?

LETTY

I bombed. It's either work in the

office or nothing.

MICHAEL

Sounds grim.

LETTY

Yeah.    How was the job search?

LETTY

Who ever said sanity was fun?

MICHAEL

It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.

LETTY

Promise?

MICHAEL

Promise.

(beat)

As long as we have steak.

LETTY

Steak?

99.

MICHAEL

It's a well-known fact that a red-

meat dinner can cure the blues.

(beat)

You and Beast wait here. I'll be

back in a jiff.

MICHAEL

While I'm gone why don't you slip

into something a little more naked?

LADY ONE

I can't believe he did that.

LADY TWO

What a weirdo.

MICHAEL

Don't ever talk about me again, you

hear me?

LETTY

I thought maybe you got lost.

MICHAEL

The store was busy.

LETTY

You got wine. That's great.

100.

MICHAEL

Would you mind if we just called it

an early night?

LETTY

You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.

M

ICHAEL

I think I should go home.

LETTY

Are you OK?

MICHAEL

Big restaurant interview tomorrow.

LETTY

But what about the red meat-blues

thing?

MICHAEL

You know, we've got that dinner

with my parents tomorrow, too. I

should really get some rest

tonight.

LETTY

(to Beast)

How's filet sound?

ichael stares blankly at his application.    He fills out his

MICHAEL

(under his breath)

No, no, no. Not now. No.

101.

MRS. SANTUCCI

More water. It's too pasty.

LETTY

I'll never Mget the hang of this.

RS. SANTUCCI

All the Santucci women go through

this.

MR. SANTUCCI

Hi there, Letty.

LETTY

Hi, Frank.

MR. SANTUCCI

It needs more water.

LETTY

(to Mrs. Santucci)

Maybe we should make lamb next

week.

MRS. SANTUCCI

Hi, Sweetheart.

LETTY

How'd it go?

102.

LETTY

What happened?

MICHAEL

Four interviews. Four no-gos.

LETTY

The restaurant, too?

MICHAEL

I couldn't even face that one.

LETTY

That's OK. We can call and

reschedule in the morning.

MICHAEL

You don't have to take care of me,

you know.

MRS. SANTUCCI

Maybe we should save the job talk

for after dinner.

MICHAEL

(to Letty)

Just promise you'll love me even if

I end up in a job where I have to

wear a blue polyester cap.

LETTY

I think you know I'd love you even

more in a blue polyester cap.

LETTY (OS)

You're going to miss the Top Ten.

103.

MICHAEL

Coming.

LETTY (OS)

Michael, hurry.

LETTY

I think I could get the program up

and running in the next two weeks.

JOHANSEN

From what I understand the

principal has removed you from

student activities.

LETTY

She's worried that I'm unstable.

LETTY

But I wouldn't push for the program

if I wasn't ready.

JOHANSEN

What about the office work?

LETTY

I'd have to do that, too. But I've

gotten better at pacing myself.

JOHANSEN

Are you sure?

104.

LETTY

I'll call you if I have problems.

Scout's honor.

JOHANSEN

I have to say I'm inclined to give

it another try.

JOHANSEN

But, Letty, why don't you give

yourself three weeks to set it up

this time?

MICHAEL

Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.

LETTY

I got worried. Are you OK?

ICHAEL

How may I help you?

LETTY

Congratulations.

MRS. MAYER

Michael, the shop's about to close.

Maybe you could try on your tux.

LETTY

(to Mrs. Mayer)

Michael just got a job.    Couldn't

you congratulate him?

105.

MRS. MAYER

I will, Dear. I promise.

(beat)

Why McDonald's?

LETTY

He's been looking everywhere for

weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy

after you've been locked away.

MRS. MAYER

I've read that lots of people my

age are supplementing their incomes

these days by working at McDonald's

and Burger King.

LETTY

I'm going to take that as an honest

effort at being open minded.

MRS. MAYER

Don't be fresh.

LETTY

Just remember that I love him.

MRS. MAYER

(to Letty)

I'll say this, Dear.   He looks damn

good in a tuxedo.

MICHAEL

Aunt Lily is the one who married

your father's cousin?

LETTY

No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is

the one who looks like a hooker.

106.

MICHAEL

Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who

likes magic?

LETTY

You don't have to know all this by

Saturday. It took me years.

AUNT LILY

(to Michael)

What a beautiful wedding.

MICHAEL

(to Letty)

Aunt Lily?

LETTY

Bingo.

107.

MRS. MAYER

Oh, and have you met Michael?    He's

Letty's boyfriend.

RUTH

The worst was when I stammered

Jake's name.

LETTY

I don't think people even noticed.

I thought the ceremony was perfect.

RUTH

That's thanks to all your help.

LETTY

Uh oh, Uncle Cort at 6 o'clock.

RUTH

Sorry to do this to you. But I am

the bride.

CORT

(to Letty)

I don't think I've seen you in two

or three years.

LETTY

Has it been that long?

CORT

You were with that lawyer.

LETTY

I'm dating Michael now.

CORT

Met him in the receiving line. What

is it that he does for a living?

108.

LETTY

Well, he just got a job...

M

ICHAEL

In the restaurant business.

CORT

Speak of the devil.

(beat)

How did you guys meet again?

LETTY

At the psych hospital.

CORT

I would've sent a card, but your

aunt and I, we weren't sure if that

was the thing to do.

LETTY

That's fine, Uncle Cort.

CORT

(to Michael)

So you were a volunteer over at the

hospital?

MICHAEL

Something like that.

LETTY

When he could get time off from the

restaurant business.

MICHAEL

(to Letty)

How about a dance?

CORT

You two go ahead. I'm going to go

bother that pretty sister of yours

for a dance.

LETTY

Bye, Uncle Cort.

(to Michael)

What's with the lie?

109.

MICHAEL

It wasn't exactly a lie.

LETTY

Pretty close.

MICHAEL

People at weddings don't want the

truth.

LETTY

It's not good to drink so much with

the medication you're on.

MICHAEL

What's with this music? I'll go

talk to the D.J. and see if we

can't get something good going.

MR. MAYER

It's good to see you so happy.

LETTY

Thanks, dad.

CUT TO:

e stares straight ahead.    Letty kneels down in front of him.

110.

LETTY

Michael?

(beat)

Michael? You should come to bed.

LETTY

Did you take the aspirin and water?

You don't want to feel awful in the

morning.

(beat)

I'll get you some.

LETTY

What is it? Are you OK?

MICHAEL

(strangely calm)

Always the drugs.

LETTY

What?

MICHAEL

I saw you talking to my Mom.

LETTY

We both talked to her, Michael.

And your dad.

MICHAEL

Why'd you tell her I wasn't taking

my meds?

LETTY

What do you mean not taking your

meds?

MICHAEL

Why'd you tell?

LETTY

I didn't talk to her about

medications, Michael. Don't be

silly.

111.

MICHAEL

Silly?   Silly am I?

LETTY

Michael, take it easy.

MICHAEL

Silly, silly, silly.

LETTY

I think I should call someone.

MICHAEL

(screaming)

Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you

upset my Mom.

LETTY

Michael, calm down. Please. It's

OK.

LETTY

Michael, stop.

MICHAEL

Not my Mom. Not my silly silly

Mom.

LETTY

I've got an emergency.    I'm at...

LETTY

1450 North Jenkins. Apartment 2.

My boyfriend's out of control.

NEIGHBOR (OS)

What's going on in there?

LETTY

(into phone)

Please, please, send someone.

(beat)

No, he's having an attack. He's

schizophrenic...

LETTY

I'm sorry, so sorry.   I never

should have called.

RUTH

You did the right thing.

LETTY

I ruined your wedding night.

113.

RUTH

I'm glad you called. Now, not

another word about it.

RUTH

Oh my God.

RUTH

Did he hurt you?

LETTY

Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?

R

UTH

You don't have to make any

decisions tonight.

LETTY

But what am I going to do?

RUTH

Do you want to go see him? I'll

take you if you want to go.

LETTY

I can't.    I can't see him there.

LETTY

I was so sure. I really thought it

would work.

(beat)

We have plans, Ruth.

RUTH

I know.    I know.

114.

PAUL

I'm glad you agreed to see me.

LETTY

I'm just glad there aren't any hard

feelings.

PAUL

Oh, none. None. I completely

understand what was going on.

LETTY

Oh.

PAUL

How's work going?    Are you back at

school?

LETTY

I start on Monday.

PAUL

So things are back on track?

LETTY

Getting back.

PAUL

I heard about your friend.

LETTY

What?

115.

PAUL

I heard your friend was back in the

hospital.

LETTY

Michael.   Yes.

PAUL

I just wondered, well, if this

meant there was a chance for us.

Because I think about you a lot,

and I still feel...

LETTY

Our relationship meant a lot to me,

too, Paul. But it's over.

(beat)

And Michael being in the hospital

doesn't really change things.

PAUL

I think I've heard this speech

before.

LETTY

I'm really sorry.

P

AUL

I've got a deposition that I really

need to get cracking on, so if you

don't mind...

LETTY

Sure, I understand.

LETTY

Wait. Wait.

LETTY

I need to give you this.

116.

NURSE GATES

He's in Jamie's old room.

MICHAEL (OS)

Come in.

LETTY

Hi.

MICHAEL

Hey.

LETTY/MICHAEL (TOGETHER)

How are you?

LETTY

I guess we need to talk.

MICHAEL

I guess so.

LETTY

It's hard to know where to start.

MICHAEL

Pretend like I'm your shrink.

MICHAEL

Sorry.   I'll be quiet.

117.

LETTY

I think about you all the time.

MICHAEL

I sure know what that feels like.

LETTY

And all the plans we have.

MICHAEL

Yeah, the plans.

LETTY

I've been thinking I could try to

visit you at night after work, and

then there'd be more time on

weekends to see...

MICHAEL

Letty, please.

L

LETTY

What?

MICHAEL

Like I've told you before I don't

want you taking care of me.

LETTY

Someone has to take care of you

right now, Michael. You tore up

the apartment. You stopped taking

your medications.

MICHAEL

But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean

to do that.

LETTY

Well then why'd it happen?

MICHAEL

I don't know. I don't fucking

know.

LETTY

I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to

blame you.

118.

MICHAEL

I didn't mean for any of this to

happen.

LETTY

Oh, God, Michael, I know.

(softly)

Why does everything have to be so

hard?

LETTY

What are we going to do?

MICHAEL

What do you want to do?

LETTY

I know I don't want to lose you.     I

don't think I could stand it.

MICHAEL

Yeah, but can you stand to be with

me like this?

LETTY

No. I can't, Michael. I'm so sorry,

but I just can't handle all this

right now.

MICHAEL

I know.   I can't either.

LETTY

I love you so much.

MICHAEL

I love you too, Letty.     I love you,

too.

LETTY

Maybe we could just run away to

Tahiti and live on the beach.

119.

MICHAEL

That's the best idea I've heard in

a long time.

LETTY

Don't you have a magic trick or

something to make this easier?

MICHAEL

How about something better?   Like a

kiss.

he couple kisses more tenderly than ever before.

LETTY

I can still come visit you, you

know.

MICHAEL

Would that really be such a good

idea for either of us?

LETTY

Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?

MICHAEL

I will. And you make sure you take

care of yourself.

MICHAEL

Promise you won't fall for any guys

pretending to be doctors.

LETTY

I guess I should go now.

MICHAEL

You should go.

120.

LETTY

First of all, I want to welcome you

to MathShop. I have lots of fun

games planned for us.

(beat)

Let's see, Bobby, can you help me

pass out these cards?

LETTY

Is something wrong, Bobby?

BOBBY

Why were you gone so long?

JENNY

My mom said you went crazy.

LETTY

I had what some people call a

nervous breakdown. I wasn't

dealing with life so well so I

went...

BOBBY

To a place for psychos.

LETTY

To a psychiatric institution.

J

ENNY

What's that?

LETTY

It's a place where you figure out

what you want, and what things in

your life aren't working. You

learn to look out for yourself and

not get...

121.

LETTY

Let me show you the best thing I

learned.

Wow./ Neat./ Do it again, Miss

Mayer.
