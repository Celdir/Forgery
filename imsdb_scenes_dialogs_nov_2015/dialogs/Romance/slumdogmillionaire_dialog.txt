1   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 1

An expensive bathroom suite. Excess of marble and gold

taps. Into the bath, a hand is scattering rupee notes.

Hundreds and hundreds of notes, worth hundreds of

thousands of rupees. The sound of a fist thumping on

the bathroom door, furious shouting from the other

side.

JAVED O/S

Salim! Salim!

2   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. DAY.                              2

Darkness. Then, glimpses of faces. In the half-light,

shadowy figures move with purpose. An implacable voice

announces.

TALKBACK V/O

Ten to white-out, nine, eight,

seven...

PREM

Are you ready?

Silence. A hand shakes a shoulder a little too roughly.

PREM (CONT'D)

I said are you ready?

JAMAL

Yes.

3   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 3

The thumping at the door continues. The sound of

mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand

cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the

chamber, snaps the chamber shut.

TALKBACK V/O

...three, two, one, zero. Cue

Prem, cue applause...

Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.

A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...

4   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       4

...we are back in the studio, the gun-fire morphing

into rapturous applause.

TALKBACK V/O

Go, Prem.

A wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage.

Cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. On

stage, Jamal, an eighteen year-old Indian boy-man

stares, petrified. He would surely turn and run but for

the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, Prem

Kumar.

PREM

Welcome to Who Wants To Be A

Millionaire!

More applause.

PREM (CONT'D)

Please give a warm welcome to

our first contestant of the

night- a local from our very own

Mumbai!

Under cover of the wild applause, Prem ushers Jamal

towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing.

PREM (CONT'D)

Smile, dammit.

The lights seem to bore into him but Jamal manages a

tentative smile. Out of nowhere, a hand slaps him

ferociously across the face. Then again and again.

Blood trickles from his mouth.

5   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. NIGHT.                               5

The studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the

harsh bulb of an interrogation light. Jamal is strung

from the ceiling by his arms.

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

Your name, bhen chod.

Constable Srinivas's hand pulls back Jamal's head by

the hair, forcing him to stare directly into the

lights.

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS (CONT'D)

Your name!

JAMAL

Jamal Malik.

And seamlessly we are back....

6   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         6

...on the set of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Prem

leans back in his chair, a man at home in his

surroundings. Jamal sits opposite, frozen.

PREM

So, Jamal, tell us a bit about

yourself.

Close on Jamal's face. Without warning, it is shoved

under water.

7   INT. BUCKET. NIGHT.                                         7

We look up from the bottom of the bucket at the

screaming face of a drowning man. His head shakes

desperately, pointlessly. Then Jamal's face is dragged

up again, roaring for breath. Close on his eyes.

JAMAL V/O

I work in a call centre. In

Juhu.

8   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         8

PREM

A Phone-basher! And what type of

call centre would this be?

JAMAL

XL 5. Mobile phones.

PREM

Aha! So, you're the man who

rings me up every single day of

my life with Special Offers,

huh?

JAMAL

No, actually, I'm an assistant.

PREM

An Assistant Phone-basher?

A raised eye-brow at the audience. Amusement ruffles

through them.

PREM (CONT'D)

And what does an Assistant Phone-

basher do, exactly?

JAMAL

I- I get tea for people and-

PREM (CONT'D)

So, ladies and gentlemen, Jamal

Malik from Mumbai, let's play

Who Wants To Be A

Millionaire...!

INSPECTOR

Has he confessed, yet?

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

Apart from his name, I can't get

a word out of the runt.

INSPECTOR

You've been here all bloody

night, Srinivas. What have you

been doing?

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

Tough guy.

INSPECTOR

A little electricity will loosen

his tongue.

INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

Every night I get home, "why

can't we have a/c like Bajan

INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

Why don't you care about your

poor family, dying in this

heat." Twenty-four years a

policeman and I can't afford

bloody a/c.

INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

But you. You've got ten million

rupees ek dum guaranteed, yaar?

And who knows how much further?

Fancy the twenty million, do

you?

INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

I think you probably do.

INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

So. Were you wired up? A mobile

or a pager, correct? Some little

hidden gadget? No? A coughing

accomplice in the audience?

Microchip under the skin, huh?

INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

Srinivas! Look, it's hot, my

wife is giving me hell, I've got

a desk full of murderers,

rapists, extortionists, assorted

bum-bandits...and you. Why don't

you save us both a lot of time?

Hmm?

INSPECTOR OF POLICE

He's unconscious, chutiya. What

good is that? How many times

have I told you-?

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

Sorry, Sir.

YOUNG CONSTABLE

He's coming! Sir.

INSPECTOR

Are wa, Srinivas, we'll have

Amnesty International in here

next, peeing their pants about

human rights. Get him down, tidy

him up, for God's sake.

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

Maybe he did know the answers.

INSPECTOR

Have you gone soft, Srinivas?

Professors, lawyers, doctors,

General Knowledge Wallahs never

get beyond sixteen thousand

rupees. And he's on ten million?

What the hell can a slum dog

possibly know?

JAMAL

The answers.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

I know the answers.

Not at all, not at all. I hope

you will visit us, Commissioner.

Ah, Inspector! Cracked it?

Nearly, Sir.

COMMISSIONER OF POLICE

Nearly? Nearly? When Prem Kumar

himself has-

PREM

Inspector. How good to meet you.

Clearly the kid cheated.

INSPECTOR

Clearly, Sir.

PREM

So, it is just a question of

how, no?

INSPECTOR

Indeed, Sir. The proof. That is

all we need.

PREM

We are lucky to have a man of

your obvious experience on the

case. This kid might run rings

around us filmi types, but he

won't make fools out of the

Mumbai Police Force, I can see

that.

In front of sixty million

people.

Which is what will happen if we

don't get a result, Gentlemen.

He goes back on the show to rob

us all with the whole of India

watching. But. I can rely on

you.

PREM (CONT'D)

Has he- has he made any

allegations?

INSPECTOR

Allegations?

PREM

He's a cunning one. A convincing

liar. Don't be taken in,

Inspector, don't be taken in.

knows the answers. Talk.

18   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         18

PREM

So, are you ready for your first

question for one thousand

rupees?

JAMAL

Yes.

Not bad money to sit in a chair

than making the tea, no?

JAMAL O.S.

It's a shy one. Since when was

there a time limit on a crap?

SALIM

Since there was a customer

waiting, that's when.

JAMAL O.S.

(singing/ grunting)

Come on out, you beauty, unveil

yourself, my darling-warling....

PRAKASH

Look, kid, I got a bad stomach.

It's borderline....

PRAKASH (CONT'D)

I'm off to Devi's bog. Give me

You just lost me good money, you

stupid idiot-

B) Lies alone triumph. C)

Fashion alone triumphs. D) Money

PREM (CONT'D)

What do we think, Jamal? The

most famous phrase in our

country's history. Maybe you

want to phone a friend?

PREM (CONT'D)

Or Ask the Audience? I have a

hunch they might just know the

answer. What do we think?

Yes.

INSPECTOR

So, Jamal. My five-year-old

daughter knows the answer to

that, but you don't. Strange for

a millionaire genius. What

happened? Your accomplice nip

out for a piss, did he? Or did

he just not cough loud enough?

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

The Inspector asked you a

question.

JAMAL

How much is bhelpuri at Jeevan's

stall on Chowpatty Beach?

INSPECTOR

What?

JAMAL

One bhelpuri. How much?

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

(can't help

himself)

Ten rupees.

JAMAL

Wrong. Fifteen since Divali. Who

stole Constable Varma's bicycle

outside Dadar Station last

Thursday?

INSPECTOR

You know who that was?

JAMAL

Everyone in Juhu knows that.

Even five year-olds.

rupees if you just admit it. You

No, you want to go back on the

rupees, don't you?

Wouldn't you?

PREM

The audience has chosen. And,

whaddya know? Ninety-nine

percent of them think the answer

is A). The truth alone triumphs.

What do we think, Jamal? A

hundred percent would have made

me a little more reassured,

maybe....

PREM (CONT'D)

Are you married, Jamal?

JAMAL

No.

PREM

Well, don't despair, there's

someone out there who thinks our

national motto is "Fashion alone

triumphs". You two could be very

well matched.

PREM (CONT'D)

One more question before the

commercial break. What will our

Call Centre Assistant do next?

PREM (CONT'D)

Religion! Interesting. For

sixteen thousand rupees,

in depictions of the God Ram, he

is famously holding what in his

right hand? Is it A) a flower.

B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)

a bow and arrow?

Jamal Malik, you answered D? Ram

You've just won sixteen thousand

Time for a commercial break-

You're from the Juhu slum,

Hmm? Sure. Know where I live

Heavy, desperate breathing. Feet stumble on roots. Fall

smack into their faces. But they are so scared, nothing

They run over the tracks, between the trains, but the

shouts are getting louder, the torches closer. A diesel

engine is moving out of the station. Jamal, Latika and

Salim sprint for the Guard's Van at the very back of

the moving train. Punnoose is closest to them. Salim is

fastest and first to jump the train. He holds out his

hand. Jamal grabs it and is hauled in. Jamal holds his

hand out to Latika.

build this five star hotel for

everyone who wanted to visit her

tomb...but he died in- in

fifteen eighty-seven, before any

of the rooms were built. Or the

lifts. The swimming pool,

however, as you can see was

completed on schedule in top

She nods upwards. Salim and Jamal head up the dark,

tiny staircase. The Woman picks up the phone on her

desk.

99    INT. LANDING. NIGHT.                                          99

On the tiny landing, Salim and Jamal pull back a

curtain to reveal a humping couple. They move on, past

more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex,

not in the least perturbed to be interrupted. They

reach the end of the landing. From the other side of

the door comes the filmi music. Jamal puts his eye to

one of the gaps in the slatted door. Through it he can

see glimpses of a girl dancing to the music. Latika;

though not the rag-picker of before. Now fifteen, she

is a beautiful young woman and dressed in a revealing,

turquoise, silk sari.

SALIM

Is it her or not?

He shoves Jamal out of the way and watches.

SALIM (CONT'D)

Shit, she's sexy, man....

Then the music stops, an effeminate man steps into the

limited frame Salim can see and snaps a stick down hard

on Latika's hand.

DANCE TEACHER

Smile! Flow, flow! You entice

with the hands not make

chapattis, you gawaar. Again.

The man starts the music again and Latika's hands flow

elegantly around her head.

DANCE TEACHER (CONT'D)

Lift your feet, you lump. Stop,

stop!

The stick is raised to hit her but Jamal opens the

door.

DANCE TEACHER

What the hell do you want?

He switches off the music.

JAMAL

Come. Quick.

But Latika remains fixed.

DANCE TEACHER

You silly little boys. Get out

now while you can.

JAMAL

Come with us.

Latika runs to Jamal. But she freezes as she looks at

the doorway. Maman, Punnoose and the Woman from

downstairs stand there. The skin around Punnoose's eye

bears the blisters from the chloroform burn years ago.

MAMAN

Look who we have here, Punnoose.

Hello again, Jamal. Salim. Never

forget a face. Especially one

that I own.

PUNNOOSE

Shall I take them to the

marshes?

MAMAN

Whatever you like. Have fun.

Just make sure that you dispose

of them properly afterwards. No

traces, thank you.

He turns to Jamal.

MAMAN (CONT'D)

You really thought you could

just walk in and take my prize

away? Have you any idea how much

this little virgin is worth,

bhen chod?

He fingers Latika's hair.

MAMAN (CONT'D)

Get them out of here.

Punnoose and the Muscle walk towards Jamal. Maman turns

to the Dance Teacher as they grab his arms.

MAMAN (CONT'D)

Please continue, Master-ji.

The Dance Teacher puts the music back on.

(CONTINUED)

SALIM

No.

Suddenly, Salim is holding a pistol.

SALIM (CONT'D)

Leave him. Get over there.

Punnoose and the Muscle slowly release Jamal and join

Maman.

MAMAN

Let's not be foolish, Salim.

Heavy, aren't they?

Salim straightens up his gun arm.

SALIM

Money.

MAMAN

You can have money. Here.

Maman gets out his wallet and throws all the money in

it on the floor.

MAMAN (CONT'D)

Take it. Go. Disappear with your

friend and we'll forget all

about this. Okay?

Salim collects up the money.

SALIM

Maman never forgets. Isn't that

right?

MAMAN

Oh, Maman can make an exception.

Salim walks over to the music, turns it up. Picks up a

cushion from the bed and walks right up to Maman.

SALIM

Can't take that risk, Maman.

Sorry.

He wraps the cushion around the gun and pulls the

trigger. Or tries to. Nothing happens. There is a

frozen moment as they watch him fail to shoot.

Everybody watches with surreal interest as Salim

fumbles with the pistol. Eventually he looks up,

giggles stupidly.

SALIM (CONT'D)

Safety catch.

Shrugs apologetically and shoots. Nobody is more

surprised than Maman who crumples onto the floor.

(CONTINUED)

66.

100   CONTINUED: (3)                                        100

Latika starts desperately gathering up the notes on the

floor, grabs Maman's wallet. Jamal just stands.

SALIM (CONT'D)

Come on.

They run out of the room and down the stairs as Maman

dies on the floor in front of his frozen colleagues.

101   EXT. CHOWPATTY BEACH. DUSK.                             101

Children are splashing in the sea, flying kites,

digging sand, laughing. Salim, Latika and Jamal are

crouched on the shore watching the sun sink into the

sea. Latika is going through Maman's wallet, Salim is

fingering the pistol, admiringly. Jamal is staring out

to sea. Each in their own world, yet sharing swigs from

a bottle of Johnny Walker.

LATIKA

Shit, there's thousands here.

SALIM

We should be celebrating.

JAMAL

You just killed somebody.

SALIM

He was going to kill us.

JAMAL

Where did you get the gun?

SALIM

Bought it. Now, I'm going to

have to throw this beauty in the

sea.

LATIKA

You didn't need to kill him.

SALIM

What? Typical. I save your life

and you're on at me. All you

ever do is mess us up. Whenever

you're around-

JAMAL

- shut up, can't you? Just shut

up.

Silence.

SALIM

Why can't you just be happy,

huh?

SALIM

You got what you wanted, didn't

you? So, let's celebrate.

LATIKA

Yeah. Let's celebrate.

She takes a long swig from the bottle.

LATIKA (CONT'D)

While we can.

She nudges Jamal and holds the bottle out to him.

Smiles at him. He smiles back, shakes the black dog

from his head and takes a long, long drink. Latika and

Salim cheer.

101A   EXT. TULIP STAR. NIGHT.                              101A

Latika, Salim and Jamal bend back a bit of the wire

mesh fence that protects the deserted hotel. Crawl in.

102    INT. TULIP STAR. LOBBY. NIGHT.                           102

A very wobbly Latika, Salim and Jamal walk up the

frozen escalators of the empty hotel, lit only by

security lights. Kick through the odd pile of rubbish

and stacked-up chairs. Go to the dusty reception desk.

JAMAL

Service!

SALIM

Reception!

JAMAL

We want a room, boy. Executive

Class with smoking. Third floor

with balcony.

LATIKA

Sea-facing, yaar.

Latika? Salim?

Where are they? Suddenly,

LATIKA

Room service!

She comes shooting out of the darkness across the

kitchen floor riding a trolley with Salim pushing her

at top speed. Jamal has to skid out of the way. He

grabs another trolley and glides off in pursuit.

102B   INT. TULIP STAR. CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                       102B

The three stand by a mirror and play with their

102C   INT. TULIP STAR. HOTEL LOBBY. LATER.                    102C

On top of the metal preparation counters, Salim and

Jamal are fencing: Jamal with a fish slice and Salim

with a large spoon.

103    INT. HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.                                  103

An empty, dusty hotel suite. Jamal is on the phone.

JAMAL

Johnny Walker Red Label, beer,

wine-

LATIKA

JAMAL

Ah! Chicken....

Jamal closes his eyes at the wonderful thought.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

What kind of chicken?

Latika is clearly in the shower. Jamal wanders in

carrying an old pair of lunghi. Shouts through the

door.

JAMAL

Found some lunghi!

LATIKA V/O

Stay there. Look away.

The shower stops.

JAMAL

Atcha, atcha.

LATIKA V/O

I'll know if you're looking....

JAMAL

I'm not!

With a towel around her, Latika comes to the doorway

where Jamal is holding out a the lunghi with his eyes

tight shut.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

Where's Salim?

LATIKA

Dunno.

She watches this innocent a second with true fondness.

disappears into the bathroom, slamming the door with a

giggle.

105   EXT. MUMBAI SLUM STREET. NIGHT.                          105

Salim wanders the crowded streets of a slum. He stops

uncertainly at a doorway where a group of men are

lolling, smoking. Plucks up his courage.

SALIM

I'm looking for Javed-bhai.

MAN

Ja, mada chod. He's not looking

for you. Ja!

SALIM

I need to see him.

The group of men stir, irritated now. Salim begins to

back away, then stops. Pulls the gun from behind his

back.

SALIM (CONT'D)

I killed Maman. I'll kill you

too. Easy.

The group are frozen.

JAVED

You killed him?

Javed is standing in the doorway.

JAVED (CONT'D)

My enemy's enemy is my friend,

no? So, come in, friend.

106   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                  106

Jamal and Latika lie on the bed, drunk, though still

coherent. Latika is dressed in the Bell-Boy's jacket

and the old lunghi.

LATIKA

Maman's gang will hunt us. You

know that?

JAMAL

I don't care.

LATIKA

Me neither.

They burst into stupid laughter. The laughter subsides.

(CONTINUED)

71.

106   CONTINUED:                                              106

JAMAL

That dance you were doing. In

Pila Street. Show me.

Latika rolls over and switches off the light. Rolls

back. In the half light, her hands begin to move for

Jamal, the elegant, alluring hand movements of the bar-

girl dancers. Jamal stares, mesmerised.

LATIKA

You came back for me.

JAMAL

Of course.

LATIKA

I thought you'd forgotten.

AMIR

I never forgot. Not for one day.

I knew I'd find you in the end.

It's our destiny.

LATIKA

Destiny. Yes.

Latika stops her hands. They stare at each other, their

faces inches away from each other. Latika strokes

Jamal's face.

LATIKA (CONT'D)

Thank you.

And face to face, they slowly fall asleep.

107   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                 107

SALIM

Hey.

Jamal opens his eyes. Salim is standing over them,

swaying with alcohol.

JAMAL

Salim?

He puts his hand out to Latika.

SALIM

Come.

JAMAL

No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a

lot to drink...

Jamal tries to get up, but Salim's hand is round his

throat and pushes him down on the bed.

(CONTINUED)

72.

107   CONTINUED:                                             107

SALIM

I am the elder. And I am the

boss. For once, you do as I say.

JAMAL

No.

Salim pulls Latika to her feet.

SALIM

I saved your bloody life, didn't

I?

LATIKA

Salim, please-

SALIM

- chup, sali.

As he turns, pulling a protesting Latika, Jamal leaps

on him. The two brothers go down fighting, but of

course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches

herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost

delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the

door, laughing.

108   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                            108

Salim throws him out into the corridor, slams the door.

SALIM

I am Number One now!

JAMAL

Salim, no, no....!

SALIM

Get yourself a room, bhai.

Salim slams the door. Jamal gets up, bangs on the door,

keeps on banging until the door opens and Salim stands

there with the pistol pointing straight at Jamal's

head.

SALIM (CONT'D)

The man with the Colt 45 says

chup.

He shoves Jamal hard down the corridor, the gun pointed

at him all the while.

JAMAL

Salim...

Salim nods towards the fire escape door.

(CONTINUED)

73.

108   CONTINUED:                                               108

SALIM

Now go. Or Gunmaster G-9 will

shoot you right between the

eyes. Boom. Don't think he

won't. You have five seconds.

One, two, three, four-

Salim cocks the pistol. Jamal screws up his eyes for

the inevitable. But Salim shoves him out with a roar

and slams the door. Jamal bangs on the door.

JAMAL O/S

Salim...

Salim walks slowly back down the corridor as Jamal

bangs and bangs on the door. Down the hall, Salim's

door shuts.

109   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                            109

The Inspector is staring hard at Jamal. Srinivas is

desperately trying to get his attention.

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

Sir, sir!

INSPECTOR

(eventually)

Enlighten us Constable.

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

Accessory to murder, Sir.

The Inspector puts his hands in the air, palms up.

Simple.

INSPECTOR

Only the finest minds in the

Mumbai Police Force.

Untroubled by irony, Srinivas looks extremely pleased.

INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

Go check the files, Constable.

Srinivas goes out.

INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

You puzzle me, Slumdog.

Admitting murder to avoid a

charge of fraud is not exactly

clever thinking. Now, why would

you do that?

Jamal shrugs.

(CONTINUED)

74.

109   CONTINUED:                                            109

JAMAL

When somebody asks me a

question, I tell them the

answer.

110   EXT. TULIP STAR. MORNING.                                110

At the gate, a Security Guard is sitting in his chair.

JAMAL

Where are they?

The Guard grunts.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

Where did they go?

A more impatient grunt from the Guard. He stands up,

walks towards Jamal.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

Please, Sir. Which way?

SECURITY GUARD

I don't know and I don't care.

The Guard raises his stick and gives him a roar. Jamal

backs away onto the street. The Guard slams the gate

shut. Jamal looks despairingly up and down the street

at the teeming traffic, the crowds.

PREM V/O

Ready for another question.

JAMAL V/O

Yes. I'm ready.

111   OMITTED                                                  111

112   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      112

We are back in the Studio.

PREM

For two and a half million

rupees. Ladies and Gentlemen.

Cambridge Circus is in which UK

City. Is it A) Oxford, B) Leeds,

C) Cambridge, D) London.

Jamal smiles.

PREM (CONT'D)

He's smiling. Why does that

worry me?

75.

113   EXT. MUMBAI. DAY.                                        113

Leaden skies. Torrential rain is hammering on the tin

roofs of the slum.

114   INT. SHACK. DAY.                                         114

Eighteen year-old Jamal's eyes open. Now with the

beginnings of a beard and moustache, Jamal wakes in a

tiny shack just big enough for a mattress on the floor.

He pulls on a shirt, lifts the mattress and takes out

his trousers which have been pressing there all night,

puts them over his shoulder, picks up his shoes and

goes down a ladder.

115   INT. SHACK. DAY.                                         115

He descends into a room and two feet of water that is

eddying around the ground floor of the shack. Wades out

of the door into the narrow lane of the slum.

116   EXT. SLUM. DAY.                                          116

Jamal nods hello to a number of neighbours, also bare-

legged, also with their shoes in hand. Together, they

wade to higher ground, put on their trousers and shoes

and trudge up to the main road.

117   INT. CALL CENTRE. NIGHT.                                 117

Ultra-modern, glass-windowed office. The words Cultural

Studies are written on the white board. Jamal walks in

with a tray of glasses of chi. He puts a glass down on

the young, hip, Teacher's desk and heads out again.

TEACHER

Okay, guys, it's been a big week

in UK. Kat is back.

He holds up a copy of Radio Times showing Kat from East

Enders smiling at them. A collective groan from the

Trainees.

BARDI

She's already back.

TEACHER

Bardi...Jamal?

JAMAL

Oh. Well. She did come back,

then she went away when Alfie

split up with her and now she's

back again.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

76.

117   CONTINUED:                                             117

JAMAL (CONT'D)

But it looks as if Alfie still

fancies Mo after all, so-

TEACHER

- thank you, Jamal. Keep up,

Bardi. The chi-wallah knows more

than you.

Bardi glares at Jamal. Jamal shrugs apologetically and

goes out.

TEACHER (CONT'D)

Okay, it's been super-duper hot

for UK this week, so there'll be

a lot of chat about that- they

love their weather- and there's

the festival in Edinburgh-

Edinburgh?

He points at a young woman Trainee.

NASREEN

Scotland. Kilts, castles, err,

haggis? Porridge, the Highlands,

mountains. Ben- Ben Nevis?

The Teacher points at another Trainee.

TRAINEE 2

Detective Taggart. Whisky, Sean

Connery!

TEACHER

And lochs. Their word for lakes.

Good. It's also double bonus

time for an upgrade to the

`friends and family' package

this week, so remember to push

for an upgrade...

EVERYONE

...Every Call!

Jamal walks out, turns a corner.

118   INT. CALL CENTRE. UK FLOOR. NIGHT.                       118

We are confronted with a room you could swing a Boeing

in. Rows and rows of Operators in tiny booths stretch

into the distance. On the walls are pictures of London,

Tony Blair, red telephone boxes, the Yorkshire Dales,

the Highlands- a snapshot of tourist Britain. Huge

posters of soap stars and celebrities adorn the rest of

the walls. Slogans hang from the ceiling. "When the sun

comes up, you'd better be running", "you snooze, you

lose", "Upgrade for a better, faster life." "Every call

is a new opportunity".

(CONTINUED)

77.

118   CONTINUED:                                             118

Each section of the room has a banner with a British

city's name on it and various mock sign-posts for the

different aisles. A Manager under the banner

"Bradford", is standing over an Operator, listening in

on a call. The Manager leans over and presses a key.

MANAGER

If they want an upgrade, a new

tariff or we're stealing them

from the other networks, you

take the call. Anything else-

He mimes cutting his throat.

MANAGER (CONT'D)

No time-wasters on Team

Bradford, kid. Leave that to the

homosexuals on Tunbridge Wells.

Jamal stops by him. The Manager takes a glass of tea

from Jamal.

MANAGER (CONT'D)

Where've you been? Dave on

Cornmarket's virtually lost his

voice, there's two on Ilkley

Moor who've had their hands up

for hours. Come on, move it!

Jamal hurries down the aisle signposted "Cornmarket",

gets to a male trainee and hands him a tea. Dave

glances around to check nobody's looking and slips off

his head-set.

DAVE

Two minutes, Jamal. I'm on

"Millionaire" duty.

JAMAL

Rajneesh...

DAVE

It's my turn, Jamal. I've had my

pee breaks. Please. If he comes

just keep your head down and

pretend you're doing an upgrade

on the-

JAMAL

- `friends and family'. I know.

Jamal still looks unwilling.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

Two minutes.

(CONTINUED)

78.

118   CONTINUED: (2)                                        118

Dave heads off towards a Rest and Recreation room,

where a big plasma screen on the wall is showing "Who

Wants To Be A Millionaire."Jamal grabs the jacket from

the back of Dave's chair, puts the head-set on and

hunches over the booth, just another Operative at work.

We become aware that every operator down the Cornmarket

aisle- and quite a few other aisles besides- is staring

in the direction of the Rest and Recreation Room.

119   INT. REST AND RECREATION ROOM. NIGHT.                 119

Dave is watching the screen.

PREM

...if you want a chance to be a

contestant on Who Wants To Be A

Millionaire, dial the number

now.

Dave dives for the doorway and waves.

120   INT. CALL CENTRE. UK FLOOR. NIGHT.                    120

Suddenly all the operators are dialling. Almost

simultaneously, twenty or so voices say.

OPERATORS

I'd like to be a contestant on

Who Wants to be a Millionaire.

Most of the Operators- including the man next to Jamal-

suddenly lose their tension.

OPERATOR

Bloody bastard. I never get it.

JAMAL

You have to dial when Prem says

"if". "If you want the chance to

be a contestant on Who Wants To

Be A Millionaire..." That's when

they open the lines.

The Operator looks at him. Jamal shrugs.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

That's what Anjum in Technical

says. He put the system in.

OPERATOR

So why don't you?

WOMAN V/O

Hello? Hello? Have I been

transferred again, for God's

sake?

(CONTINUED)

79.

120   CONTINUED:                                             120

Jamal freezes with fear. The head-set speaks again with

its broad Scottish accent.

WOMAN V/O (CONT'D)

Hello? Jesus, God, will somebody

talk to me?

JAMAL

Hello, Mrs...

He stares at the computer.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

...Mackintosh from King Gussie.

WOMAN V/O

(weary)

It's Kingussie, love. Pronounced

Kinoosie.

JAMAL

Kinoosie?

WOMAN V/O

So where are you from? Abroad, I

bet. China or somewhere. What

good is-

JAMAL

- just down the road from your

house, Mrs Mackintosh. Next to

the loch.

WOMAN V/O

(suspicious)

Oh aye? Which loch?

Jamal searches desperately around, spots a picture of

Big Ben.

JAMAL

Loch Big- Loch Ben. Next door to

Detective Taggart's flat.

WOMAN V/O

Loch Ben? Och, no, hen, that's

one of the wee ones up in the

Highlands. You're all the way up

there? But I bet it rains, eh,

hen?

JAMAL

Indeed yes, Mrs Mackintosh. I

have to wade through a metre of

water every morning.

WOMAN V/O

No!

(CONTINUED)

80.

120   CONTINUED: (2)                                        120

JAMAL

Yes, yes, Mrs Mackintosh. In my

kilt.

WOMAN V/O

Och, no, hen.

Jamal puts his feet on the desk.

JAMAL

It's alright once I've had my

porridge, my haggis and a few

Scotch whiskies- and the

monsoon's nearly over, so-

WOMAN V/O

- and what monsoon would that

be? I'd like to speak to your

supervisor, son.

JAMAL

I don't think that's a good

idea. He is a very important

man, Mrs Mackintosh-

WOMAN V/O

- get me the supervisor on this

line now-

JAMAL

- and he doesn't like bloody

time wasters.

Jamal panics, presses the button he saw the Manager

press earlier. The screen goes blank, then reboots

itself. Jamal looks around. Where the hell is Dave? On

the screen, Jamal is faced with the question: "what

name do you require?" He looks around again, and then

with one finger types in the word "Latika". He presses

enter. Hundred upon hundred of Latikas with their

surnames and phone numbers scroll down the page. He

erases her name and enters the name Salim K. Malik.

Presses enter. Fifteen numbers come up. He stares at

the numbers for a long time, then types it into his

computer and presses dial.

MAN V/O

Yeah?

JAMAL

Salim?

MAN V/O

Who wants to know? Do you know

what bloody time it is?

Clearly not Jamal's brother. Jamal cuts the line. Dials

the next number.

Huh. Hello?

Clearly not his Salim. He cuts the line. Dials again.

SALIM V/O

Hello? Hello? Who is this?

But Jamal can't speak.

SALIM V/O (CONT'D)

Hey. Is someone screwing with

me?

Silence.

SALIM V/O (CONT'D)

Who is this?

JAMAL

I am calling from XL 5

Communications Sir. As a valued

customer, we are offering you a

free upgrade with our `friends

and-

Jamal's voice peters out.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

Family.

SALIM V/O

Jamal? Is that you? Brother?

Where are you, man?...I thought

you were dead or something...we

had to go, Jamal. Maman's guys.

They were searching the

hotel...Jamal, say something.

Please.

There is another long silence.

JAMAL

Hello, Salim.

Gasps and laughter from the audience. Jamal laughs and

JAMAL (CONT'D)

Why not?

Prem grips his heart theatrically.

PREM

Can someone call me an

ambulance?

122   INT. CALL CENTRE. NIGHT.                                 122

A flash of a sign post reading `Oxford Circus',

pointing down one of the aisles. The banner above that

section of the warehouse reads `London'.

CUT TO:

Jamal hurrying down another `Kings Parade' carrying

glasses of tea. He glances up to see a large banner

that says `Cambridge'.

CUT TO:

Jamal comes back up an aisle named `Broad Street'. An

Operator on the adjacent `The High' clicks his fingers

for another cup. Jamal hurries under the sign marked

`Oxford'.

CUT TO:

The signposts of the aisles come faster and faster

`Pembroke Street', `Trafalgar Square', `East India

Dock' and finally `Cambridge Circus'.

PREM V/O

So, Jamal....

123   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      123

Jamal is sweating, his face scrunched up in thought.

JAMAL

I don't think it's Oxford.

PREM

Based on your extensive

travelling, right?

JAMAL

(almost to himself)

Well, Oxford has Broad Street,

Saint Aldates, Turl Street,

Queen Street, The High and

Magdalene Bridge- which is

pronounced Maudlin, so-

He stops as he hears the surprised laughter of the

audience.

PREM

I thought you hadn't been to UK.

JAMAL

Oh, I haven't. And it's not

Leeds, because that's Elland

Road, Kirkgate Market,

Commercial Street, St Peter's-

PREM

(icy)

- what might it be then, Jamal?

JAMAL

Well, I don't think it's

Cambridge.

PREM

Cambridge Circus is not in

Cambridge? Dare I ask why?

JAMAL

Too obvious. There's definitely

an Oxford Circus in London, and

there's a rowing race between

Oxford and Cambridge so there's

probably a Cambridge Circus too.

I'll go for D) London.

PREM

That's the logic that's got him

this far, Ladies and Gentlemen.

Who are we to argue? So. Jamal.

D. Apka final jawab?

PREM (CONT'D)

It's been a rollercoaster ride

all the way, a pleasure to have

you on the show, my friend, but

I'm sorry to say that

Huge cheers and applause. Even Jamal laughs at this. He

cannot quite believe it himself.

PREM (CONT'D)

Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

Malik, the man with two and a

half million rupees!

More applause. Prem hands him a cheque. Jamal looks at

it. Laughs again.

PREM (CONT'D)

A few hours ago, you were

fetching tea for the phone-

wallahs. Now you are richer than

they ever will ever be. What a

Jamal nods.

JAMAL

He holds out his hand. Jamal hands him back the cheque.

He tears the cheque in two.

Which cricketer has scored the

most first class centuries in

history. Was it A) Sachin

Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)

Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.

Prem allows the question to sink in.

PREM (CONT'D)

You've got a cheque for five

million rupees in your hands.

You've still got two life-lines,

Phone A Friend and 50/50. For

ten million rupees: pay, play,

option. Remember, if you get the

answer wrong, you will lose

everything like that.

He clicks his fingers.

Are you sure you want to do

this?

129   EXT. CRICKET GROUND. DAY.                                129

An Indian batsman hits a nicely-timed stroke, heads

down the wicket for a single. Turns. The other batsman

is taking a second run.

(CONTINUED)

87.

129   CONTINUED:                                            129

The Indian tries to halt the other batsman with a

shout, then succumbs to the inevitable and charges down

the wicket. A fielder hurls the ball at the stumps. The

bails fly off.

130   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                     130

JAMAL

I'll play.

Tense laughter from the audience. Prem holds up the

cheque. Jamal nods. Prem tears it up slowly. Allows the

pieces to fall to the floor.

PREM

The dreams of so many. On the

floor.

131   EXT. TOWER BLOCK. DAY.                                  131

Jamal is riding the construction lift to the top of a

high building, still just a shell but buzzing with

carpenters, bricklayers, cable-layers. The lift stops

at the top. Jamal gets out. Looks around. He is miles

up. Alone.

SALIM

Jamal!

Jamal looks around. There is Salim standing on the edge

of the building. He saunters over to Jamal, his arms

outstretched in theatrical greeting. He is groomed,

expensively dressed with the best mobile money can buy

dangling from a gold chain around his neck.

SALIM (CONT'D)

God is good, bhai. God is good.

He tries to embrace Jamal. With as much force as he can

muster, Jamal punches him in the face. Salim takes it.

Stands there. Wipes blood from his lip. Gets another

punch. Then another and another, not even defending

himself, until he is being beaten back by a raging

Jamal towards the edge of the building. Finally, he

tries to reason with Jamal

SALIM (CONT'D)

Maman's boys were after us. Had

to skip.

Jamal keeps on beating him back.

JAMAL

Liar.

(CONTINUED)

88.

131    CONTINUED:                                             131

SALIM

Left a message at reception.

Waited weeks for you in Nagpur.

JAMAL

There was no message at

reception.

SALIM

Bhai, I left a message.

Salim opens his arms, defenceless. It would take one,

small push to send him over the edge. There is a

moment, when Jamal might. He even has his hands on his

chest.

JAMAL

I will never forgive you.

SALIM

I know.

The fury in Jamal subsides minutely. Finally, he turns

away with a roar of frustration. Salim hangs his head.

131A   EXT. TOWER BLOCK. LATER.                              131A

Jamal and Salim are sitting on the very edge of the

building. They can see for miles across the city. Salim

has rediscovered his attitude.

SALIM

Can you believe it? This was our

slum. We lived just there, huh?

Now it is business, apartments,

call centres...Fuck USA, fuck

China. India is at the centre of

the world, now, bhai. And I am

at the centre of the centre,

Jamal. This is all Javed-bhai's.

JAMAL

Javed Mehta? The Gangster from

our slum? You work for him?

SALIM

Who else would protect us from

Maman's gang, huh?

JAMAL

What do you do for him?

SALIM

Anything he asks.

Salim's mobile rings. Salim is immediately subservient

on the phone. Rings off.

(CONTINUED)

89.

131A   CONTINUED:                                              131A

SALIM (CONT'D)

He is coming. You must go. My

card.

He hands Jamal a card.

JAMAL

What for?

SALIM

You think I am going to let you

out of my sight again, little

brother? You stay with me now.

Ab phut!

JAMAL

Salim, where's Latika?

SALIM

Still? She's gone, Jamal. Long

gone. Now go. Quick.

Jamal gets up, hurries away, hidden behind piles of

building materials just as Javed appears in his flash

suit and jewelry. Three of his young henchmen walk

alongside.

132    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT.    NIGHT.                        132

Jamal is asleep on a mattress on the floor of a smart

apartment. A mobile phone rings. The muffled sound of

Salim talking quietly next door. Then, Salim creeps

into the room, checks to see Jamal is asleep, unlocks a

desk drawer and brings out his pistol. He puts it in a

hold-all and goes out the front door. Jamal's eyes snap

open. He has seen it all.

JAMAL V/O

Slum dogs never sleep, only nap.

He would disappear for a couple

of days and come back changed.

Sometimes elated-

133    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                           133

The door bangs open and a giggling-drunk, half-naked

Bar Girl drags the sleeping Jamal up and into the

bathroom.

BAR GIRL

He has flipped! I can't do

anything with him....

Salim is in the bath, bathing, literally, in money.

(CONTINUED)

90.

133   CONTINUED:                                              133

SALIM

Look at it, bhai, look at it!

134   INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. DAWN.                            134

JAMAL V/O

Sometimes the opposite.

Jamal creeps towards Salim's bedroom door. He pushes it

open a fraction to see Salim crouched on the floor in

prayer, sobbing quietly.

SALIM

(whispering)

Ae khuda mujhe baksh de maine

bahut gunaah kiye hain....

JAMAL V/O

But younger brothers don't

interfere. Mostly.

135   EXT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. DAY.                             135

Salim comes out of his apartment block. Gets into his

jeep. Drives off. Doesn't notice Jamal in the motor

rickshaw that pulls out and follows him.

136   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              136

Salim approaches a gate-house to a large bungalow. The

Door-Keeper nods to him, rings a bell. From the

rickshaw, Jamal watches a woman come to the door.

Latika. Eighteen, completely beautiful and rich. She

hands Salim a package and goes back inside. Salim gets

in his jeep and drives away.

137   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              137

Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.

JAMAL

Baba, I am the new cook from the

agency. A thousand apologies, I

am late for the Memsaab.

The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief

pause, he returns.

DOOR-KEEPER

She doesn't know anything about

any cook. There's supposed to be

a dishwasher being delivered.

Know anything about that?

(CONTINUED)

91.

137   CONTINUED:                                               137

JAMAL

Baba, I am your dishwasher!

The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.

Latika appears at the gate.

LATIKA

Haven't I told you, don't

interrupt when I'm watching-

She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.

LATIKA (CONT'D)

- come inside. I'll show you the

kitchen.

138   INT. KITCHEN. DAY.                                       138

Latika and Jamal go into the kitchen. Who Wants To Be A

Millionaire plays on the tv in the background. She

turns and hugs him tight. They laugh with happiness.

LATIKA

(delighted)

Jamal, Jamal, look at you...!

Their heads are close, they might kiss. Then Latika

turns away, stares out of the window.

LATIKA (CONT'D)

Are wa, Jamal....

Jamal smiles hopefully at her. But there is sadness in

her now. She takes her sunglasses off, rubs her eyes.

There is a bruise there.

JAMAL

You've hurt your eye.

LATIKA

Why are you here?

JAMAL

To see you.

LATIKA

Well. You see me.

She stands there, challenging. On the tv, somebody is

winning money.

JAMAL

Why does everyone love this

programme?

(CONTINUED)

92.

138   CONTINUED:                                              138

LATIKA

It's the chance to escape, isn't

it? Walk into another life.

Doesn't everyone want that?

JAMAL

You have another life. A rich

one.

LATIKA

Who'd have thought it possible?

A slum dog, with all this.

JAMAL

Are you happy?

LATIKA

I have five star food, five star

clothes. I sleep in a bed, not

on the street. From where we

come from, Jamal, that is

happiness.

JAMAL

You don't look so happy with a

black eye.

LATIKA

You turn up here out of nowhere,

telling me I'm not happy: how

dare you?

Voices at the gate-house.

LATIKA (CONT'D)

God, Javed will kill you. Here.

JAMAL

Javed? You are with him?

She throws him an apron. He gets it on just in time for

Javed to walk in. Jamal turns away.

JAVED

First you want a dishwasher, now

a bloody cook-

LATIKA

-I just thought-

JAVED

- chup. The cricket's on.

Javed changes channel and dials on his mobile.

JAVED (CONT'D)

Why do you always watch that

shit? Huh? I'm already a

millionaire.

(CONTINUED)

93.

138   CONTINUED: (2)                                        138

He laughs at his own joke. Turns to Jamal.

JAVED (CONT'D)

Well, come on then, Cook. I'm

hungry. Get me a sandwich.

JAMAL

Immediately, Sir.

Javed stares at Jamal a moment, trying to place a face

he vaguely recognises. Then the Bookie comes on the

line and he turns back to the television.

JAVED

Atcha...

Latika hurries around the kitchen getting out bread and

condiments, whispering while Javed talks on the phone.

JAMAL

Come away with me.

LATIKA

Chutiye. Away where? And live on

what? What can you provide? What

have you got, Jamal?

JAMAL

Love.

JAVED

(on the mobile)

..yeah. He's on eighty-five. I

want four lakh on him making a

century. What are you

giving?...Okay, make it five

lakh.

Javed pours himself a glass of whisky, never taking his

eyes from the television.

TV COMMENTATOR

We are watching history unfold

today at the Wankhede Stadium as

Sachin Tendulkar carves his way

towards another magnificent

century and the record books.

His thirty-eighth century- the

most by any Indian cricketer

ever...

LATIKA

Love. That will feed us, will

it?

JAMAL

It won't buy you a new

dishwasher, but it might make

you happy.

(CONTINUED)

94.

138   CONTINUED: (3)                                         138

LATIKA

Where have you been? Get in the

real world, Jamal.

JAMAL

You and me. That is the real

world. Come away with me.

Latika snatches the sandwich from him and gives it to

Javed. Goes back to Jamal, whispers under cover of

putting condiments away.

LATIKA

You're crazy.

JAMAL

Salim will help us.

LATIKA

Salim? You still believe in

Salim? Jamal...I'll be gone

soon, anyway. Bombay's got too

dangerous for-

She indicates Javed.

JAMAL

Where?

LATIKA

You think he'd tell me?

JAVED

Straight bat, straight bat,

dammit.

Then the batsman at the other end calls to take a

second run.

JAVED (CONT'D)

No! A single!

Tendulkar seems to agree, tries to halt the other

batsman with a shout, then succumbs to the inevitable

and charges down the wicket. A fielder hurls the ball

at the stumps. The bails fly off.

JAVED (CONT'D)

No, no, no! stupid ben chod

idiot...

He flings his glass of whisky at the television.

Suddenly tastes what he has been eating.

JAVED (CONT'D)

And what is this shit supposed

to be, mader chod? Get out. Get

out!

(CONTINUED)

95.

138   CONTINUED: (4)                                           138

Javed throws the sandwich at him and slams out of the

room. His footsteps can be heard stomping into another

room.

LATIKA

Now go, before he kills us both.

She leads Jamal to the door.

JAVED

Latika, where's my bloody shirt?

The Armani.

Latika shouts over her shoulder.

LATIKA

Coming!

Back to Jamal.

LATIKA (CONT'D)

(whispered)

You want to do something for me?

JAMAL

Anything.

LATIKA

Then forget me.

JAMAL

I'll wait at VT station. Five

o'clock every day until you

come.

She shakes her head.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

I love you.

LATIKA

So what, Jamal? So what?

(loudly)

Now, get out and tell your no-

good agency not to send anybody

else until they've learnt to

cook. You hear?

She slams the door. Hurries back into the kitchen,

throws Javed's plate into the sink. The Door-keeper

comes in.

DOOR-KEEPER

Madam, your dishwasher has

arrived.

Leaning over the sink, Latika weeps silently.

96.

139   INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                           139

Salim has his hand around Jamal's throat.

SALIM

Why can't you let it alone? You

want money, I'll give you money.

Girls? I can get you girls.

JAMAL

You know what I want.

SALIM

You're like some crazy man-

you're obsessed.

JAMAL

She is my destiny, Salim.

SALIM

Know what your destiny is, crazy

boy? A bullet between the eyes.

And after that, he'll kill her.

Is that what you want? Huh?

JAMAL

Me, I don't care. Latika? She's

already half dead.

Salim takes his hand away from Jamal's neck.

SALIM

Yes. About that, you are right.

JAMAL

You sold her.

SALIM

(fierce)

I didn't sell her. Javed wanted

her. He gets what he wants.

He turns away bitterly.

SALIM (CONT'D)

She's doing alright. Get it into

your thick head, Jamal. She's

not yours and she never will be.

140   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      140

The lights flick back on. Prem slumps back in his

chair.

PREM (CONT'D)

You've got the luck of the

devil, yaar, I'll give you that.

JAMAL

I- I need to-

PREM

Oh, the toilet. Sure. Naveed,

Jamal wants the bog.

The Floor Manager and a Security Guard usher Jamal off-

stage. Prem looks up at the gallery, raises his eyes at

the Director. Some show. Then he gathers himself and

heads off-stage.

141   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 141

The clock reads five oh three. Jamal stands on the

footbridge. Humanity washes around him. His eyes dart

around, frightened to miss her. Checks the clock again.

Six. The platform is almost deserted. He wanders away.

142   INT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                                   142

Prem wanders down the corridor followed by a Security

Guard. Another Security Guard is waiting at the

entrance to the toilet. Prem goes in, leaving the two

Guards in the corridor.

143   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 143

Jamal stands on the footbridge gazing down at the

hordes of commuters. Five o'clock, five fifteen, five

thirty. Six. Jamal rests his head against the railings.

144   INT. TOILET. NIGHT.                                     144

Jamal is in one of the cubicles. Prem goes to the

urinal. Unzips.

PREM

A guy from the slums becomes a

millionaire overnight. You know

the only other person who's done

that? Me. I know what it's like.

I know what you've been through.

JAMAL O/S

I'm not going to become a

milionaire. I don't know the

PREM

(laughs)

You've said that before, yaar.

Prem finishes pissing. Goes over to the washbasins,

runs the taps and washes his hands.

JAMAL O/S

No, I really don't.

PREM

What? You can't take the money

and run now. You're on the edge

of history, kid!

JAMAL O/S

I don't see what else I can do.

PREM

Maybe it is written, my friend.

You're going to win this. Trust

me, you're going to win.

Prem leaves. Jamal flushes and comes out of the

cubicle. Goes to the washbasins. In the mist on the

mirror above the taps is written the letter "B". Jamal

stares at it. Gradually it fades, leaving only the

growing fury on his face staring back at him.

145    INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      145

Jamal stalks back onto the set. Sits down in his chair.

Stares at Prem who looks unconcernedly back.

TALKBACK V/O

Twenty seconds.

145A   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 145A

The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the

descending river of people out of his way, the

seventeen year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps

that cross the platforms. He pushes to the middle of

the footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He

scans the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her:

the eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly

beautiful, over the other side of the station. A world

away. She is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.

JAMAL

Latika! Latika!

But though he is screaming her name, his voice is

swallowed by the noise around him. Then he sees two

thuggish-looking men also fighting a way towards her.

(CONTINUED)

99.

145A   CONTINUED:                                           145A

JAMAL (CONT'D)

Latika!

Frightened now, he fights his way down the steps, one

figure against an army of white-robed people. He gets

to the bottom of the steps, is making progress against

the tide. But so are the two men. Jamal is now on the

same platform. Shouts her name again. She turns with a

smile. But the two Thugs leap through a train onto her

platform. She sees them, starts running, is lost in the

crowd. Jamal runs off along the platform after Latika.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

Latika! Latika!

By the time Jamal has fought himself to where Latika

was- she is gone. He whirls around, mad with

frustration.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

Latika! Latika!

Latika is jumping the tracks, crossing in front of

trains. But the Thugs are gaining on her. He brings her

down and drags her across to Javed's waiting Mercedes.

Salim is standing by the car. Jamal pushes through the

crowds just in time to see Salim bundling her into the

car.

JAMAL

Salim!

Salim spits disgustedly on the ground. Gets in. Latika

twists her head to see Jamal as the car skids off.

Jamal screams with hopeless fury.

PREM

Welcome back to Who Wants to Be

A Millionaire? In the chair

tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we

don't know! In an amazing run,

Jamal has already five million

rupees but, not content with

that, has chosen to gamble for

one Crore- that's ten million

million rupees. What a player!

The question one more time:

Which cricketer has scored the

most first class centuries in

history. Was it A) Sachin

Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)

Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.

JAMAL

I know it isn't Sachin

Tendulkar.

PREM

That's a start. So, it could be

Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or

Michael Slater.

JAMAL

I'll use a life-line. Fifty-

fifty.

Okay. Computer, take away two

wrong answers.

PREM (CONT'D)

Well, you were right about

Sachin Tendulkar. The computer

has taken away A) Sachin

Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.

That leaves you a fifty-fifty

choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting

or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you

think? Decision time. For half a

million rupees. Your answer: B)

Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs.

A hideous, never-ending pause while Jamal stares into

Prem's eyes.

JAMAL

D.

A barely perceptible jump from Prem.

PREM

You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting?

The Australian? Great cricketer.

JAMAL

D. Jack Hobbs.

PREM

Do you know?

Jamal shakes his head.

PREM (CONT'D)

So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?

JAMAL

Or D. Jack Hobbs.

PREM

Final Answer?

JAMAL

Final Answer. D.

A just-perceptible narrowing of the eyes.

PREM

Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye.

Prem turns to the computer. Music. Lights.

PREM (CONT'D)

With one hundred and ninety-

seven first class centuries, the

answer is...D. Jack Hobbs!

The audience go wild. Prem's smile is thin.

The camera goes off Prem for a second. He mimes a

disgusted spit. Then he is back on.

PREM (CONT'D)

I cannot believe what I am

seeing here, tonight, Ladies and

Gentlemen....So, are you ready

for the final question for two

Crore rupees- twenty million

rupees?

JAMAL

Not really, but...maybe it is

written, no?

PREM

Maybe, indeed. Okay, okay. For

twenty million rupees, the final

question on Who Wants to be a

Millionaire?

The lights dim again, the portentous music increases.

Suddenly a klaxon sounds. The audience burst into

nervous laughter and groans. Prem laughs.

PREM (CONT'D)

Ohhhhh! Just when I thought I

would need a pacemaker fitted,

we're out of time! What a show,

Ladies and Gentlemen, what a

show. Join us tomorrow night to

see if Jamal Malik has made the

biggest mistake of his life or

has just won the biggest prize

in the history of Indian

television....Same place, same

time. You wouldn't dare miss it.

Goodnight!

Applause. The studio lights come up. Prem switches off

his smile as fast as the cameras switch off. Gets up

and pulls out his mobile.

149   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              149

Waving a kitchen knife in on hand, a desperate Jamal

slams through the gates of Javed's bungalow, the

objecting Doorkeeper running along behind. He bangs

open the front door.

JAMAL

Latika!

Not a single thing remains. Jamal runs into another

room. As empty as the first. He stops in his tracks.

DOOR-KEEPER

Told you.

JAMAL

Where? Where is she?

DOOR-KEEPER

Dunno.

He grabs the Door-keeper by the shirt-collar, slams him

up against the wall. Holds the knife against his

throat.

JAMAL

Where?

DOOR-KEEPER

I don't know! Wouldn't say,

would they? They had to get out

fast. The police. Honestly.

Jamal lets go of the Door-keeper. Goes hopelessly to

the window. On the window sill is a phone. He picks it

up. There is a dial tone. Jamal rummages in his trouser

pocket. Gets out the battered card with Salim's details

on. Dials. Salim picks up.

JAMAL

Where are you? Where is she?

150A   INT. JAVED'S SAFE HOUSE. SALIM'S ROOM. DAY.             150A

Salim is stalking around his room in Javed's new house.

Hold-alls of clothes and possessions lie around the

room. A chest of drawers sits with its drawers open,

still empty.

SALIM

Where you'll never find her. Or

me. You could have joined us,

you bloody idiot, been one of

us. You've lost everything now.

Everything.

Cuts the call off and slings the phone in a drawer.

Takes the gun from his waist, and throws that in too.

Slams the drawer shut with as much force as he can.

104.

150B   INT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                           150B

JAMAL

Salim...!

The line goes dead. Jamal slides to the floor...

151    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                            151

...the camera pulls out from Jamal's face revealing

that Jamal is sitting on the floor of Salim's

apartment. In the background can be heard the sound of

the television. Jamal looks at the knife in his hand,

wonders what he might do with it. The sound of Prem's

voice on the tv.

PREM O/S

...if you want a chance to play

Who Wants to be a Millionaire,

call now...!

Jamal looks up. Stares at the tv.

152    INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                            152

PREM

This way, Jamal, this way. Great

show, my friend. See you

tomorrow, huh?

In the half-light, Prem guides him to a stage door.

153    EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                            153

Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the

rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is

thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into

the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at

the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens

screaming.

DIRECTOR

What's going on?

PREM

He's a cheat.

DIRECTOR

This was you? You called them?

Prem shrugs.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)

How d'you know he's cheating?

(CONTINUED)

105.

153   CONTINUED:                                             153

PREM

Oh, come on! Of course he is.

He's a bloody village boy. Even

when I fed him the wrong answer

the little shit got it right.

Director stares at him.

DIRECTOR

You gave him an answer?

PREM

Well, I didn't exactly-

The Director walks away shaking his head. In the

doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.

PREM (CONT'D)

Nita?

But she too turns and walks away.

154   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                            154

INSPECTOR

It is all bizarrely plausible.

And yet...

JAMAL

Because I am a slum dog, chi-

wallah, I am a liar, right?

INSPECTOR

Most of you are.

Srinivas comes hurrying in carrying a file, very

pleased with himself.

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

Shooting at Pila Street, October

19th...Maman Hossani....Victim

pronounced dead at scene.

Suspects absconded: two males,

early teens, one female, early

teen.

The Inspector takes the file. Stares at it. Shakes his

head.

INSPECTOR

But you: you're not a liar,

Mister Malik, that is for sure.

You are too truthful.

He turns to Srinivas.

(CONTINUED)

106.

154    CONTINUED:                                                 154

INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

Thank you, Constable. All that

remains is to work out whether

it was manslaughter or murder.

Ten years, or life.

The Young Constable sticks his head around the door.

YOUNG CONSTABLE

The Commissioner's here, Sir.

The Inspector sighs. Gets up. Accompanied by Srinivas,

he leaves the room. Jamal sits there. Lets his head

drop. The camera floats from the room, down the dingy

corridor and out through a window...

155    EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY.                                  155

....alighting on a crowd of hundreds of people jostling

to get a view of the building. News crews are setting

up around them. A tv Reporter is doing a piece to

camera.

TV REPORTER

....behind the walls of this

police station lies the mystery

all of India is talking about.

Did Jamal Malik, an uneducated,

eighteen year-old boy from the

slums of Mumbai win one Crore

rupees by fair means or foul?

And in the crowds all around me

there is an even bigger

question. Will he be back on the

show tonight to play for twenty

million rupees...

156A   INT. POLICE OFFICE. DAY.                                  156A

The Commissioner is waiting in the outer office.

COMMISSIONER OF POLICE

So? Have you charged him yet?

INSPECTOR

I- progress is being made sir.

COMMISSIONER OF POLICE

Progress? Have you charged him?

INSPECTOR

No, Sir.

(CONTINUED)

107.

156A   CONTINUED:                                                156A

The Commissioner dumps a copy of the Times of India

down on the desk. Then the Hindustan Times, the Amar

Ujala and the Afternoon Dispatch thump down after them.

All have photos of Jamal on Who Wants to be a

Millionaire on the front page.

COMMISSIONER OF POLICE

And if that isn't enough for

you...

He motions the Inspector to come over to the window.

Lifts the blind. The Inspector hurries over. Looks

alarmed.

INSPECTOR

That's-?

COMMISSIONER OF POLICE

- yes, yes! The boy's a bloody

hero with every beggar and thief

in the city. We're in danger of

looking very stupid, here,

Inspector.

INSPECTOR

Whilst I'm not convinced he

actually cheated, I have got-

The Inspector brandishes the file.

COMMISSIONER OF POLICE

- Prem Kumar himself- a man of

great standing and integrity-

said the kid was a liar and a

cheat. What more do you need?

The Inspector pauses.

INSPECTOR

A liar.

Then he puts the file behind his back. Srinivas frowns.

INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

Indeed, sir.

Srinivas coughs pointedly. Gets a steely look from the

Inspector. The Commissioner has been staring out of the

window at the crowds. Turns back to them.

COMMISIONER OF POLICE

He's in for fraud, so you charge

him for fraud. Fast. Or you'll

find yourself on traffic duty at

the Gateway of India.

Understand?

(CONTINUED)

108.

156A   CONTINUED: (2)                                       156A

INSPECTOR

Yes, sir.

The Commissioner walks out.

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

Sir-?

INSPECTOR

Not a word, Srinivas.

157    INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.            157

A cheek scarred by disfiguring knife scars. Pulling

back we see it is Latika, staring frozen at Jamal on

the television news. A palatial living room. Dealing

cards to Salim, is Javed Khan. A couple of Bar Girls

giggle next to Javed and a couple of his Thugs. Pouring

drinks at a sideboard is Latika. Javed glances up at

the screen, clearly not recognising Jamal on a clip

from Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Salim, too is

staring, wide-eyed at the tv. Javed picks up the

remote, doesn't even notice and switches over to a

music channel. Latika hurries out.

JAVED

What about my bloody whisky,

woman?

But she has already gone. He growls after her.

JAVED (CONT'D)

Hey, Salim.

He motions Salim to get him a drink. Javed's mobile

rings as Salim goes over to the sideboard. Shifts a

bottle to the back.

SALIM

We're out. I'll just get- Syed.

Salim smiles faintly at the image of Jamal and hurries

out.

158    INT . JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. SALIM'S ROOM. NIGHT.           158

A drawer opens. Inside is Salim's pistol. And a phone-

the same one he threw in there months ago. Salim stares

at both for a long time. Finally, picks up the gun and

phone.

SALIM

(to himself)

Final answer?

He finds this faintly amusing.

109.

159   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                 159

Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears

running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front

of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away

the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door

behind him. Stares at the tv.

SALIM

That boy. He will never give up.

Never.

He shakes his head.

SALIM (CONT'D)

Crazy chutiye.

Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks

towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.

SALIM (CONT'D)

Ja. Go.

LATIKA

But-

SALIM

- just drive. There won't be

another chance. Go.

Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.

LATIKA

He'll kill you.

Salim smiles, shakes his head.

SALIM

It is not written.

JAVED O/S

Salim!

Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for

her.

LATIKA

Salim, I....can't.

Salim points at the television.

SALIM

You have to. It'll take you two

hours if you drive fast. Here.

He holds out his mobile phone.

SALIM (CONT'D)

For God's sake, hold on to it.

(CONTINUED)

159   CONTINUED:                                            159

Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her

head for a moment.

SALIM (CONT'D)

For what I have done, please

forgive me.

Salim releases her.

SALIM (CONT'D)

Go. Have a good life.

Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.

Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

160   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. NIGHT.                          160

Jamal is dozing in the chair. He wakes with a shout.

Srinivas has just thrown a bucket of water in his face.

He unlocks the handcuffs. Jamal looks up at him.

Srinivas shrugs.

CONSTABLE SRINIVAS

You're back on the show.

161   INT. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                                   161

The audience for Who Wants to be a Millionaire are

standing in line. They are being body-searched by

police. Mobiles are being confiscated and put in bags.

162   INT. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                                   162

Gaffers make last-minute adjustments to the lights

shining on the empty chairs in the middle of the set.

Camera positions are checked by the Floor Manager.

163   INT. POLICE OFFICE. NIGHT.                               163

Srinivas walks Jamal through the police office, past

the Inspector sitting at his desk, his arms behind his

head, pondering. He watches Jamal go and then asks:

INSPECTOR OF POLICE

What happened? To the girl?

Latika?

Jamal stops.

JAMAL

Who knows?

Jamal walks on. The Inspector watches him all the way.

111.

164   INT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                   164

Jamal sits in the back of the police jeep. It pulls out

of the police station car park into a sea of people all

cheering and shouting at the jeep. Jamal looks

terrified.

165   INT. CAR. NIGHT.                                           165

Latika drives through the slums of Mumbai. She hoots

her horn furiously at a cart-driver ambling across the

road.

166   INT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                   166

The jeep stops at the lights and a beggar wanders up,

tapping on the windscreen. The beggar studies Jamal's

face for a second, then starts shouting and pointing at

him.

BEGGAR

Crorepati! Crorepati!

Other beggars- just like the one Jamal used to be- join

him and start cheering and applauding. The jeep pulls

away.

watching.

169   EXT. ROADSIDE CHI HOUSE. NIGHT.                            169

Driver leaps out, abandoning the irate business man in

the back and runs to the tv in the cafe.

170   INT. CALL CENTRE. NIGHT.                                   170

The Manager walks into the aircraft hanger of a

Stalks over.

Prem sneers.

TALKBACK V/O

Two minutes.

She finishes powdering Jamal.

PREM

Hey. Sweetheart. What about me?

I'm sweating, here.

NITA

You should be.

She dumps the powder compact in his hand.

So. Tonight. The Calypso Bar.

NITA

PREM

Welcome back to Who Wants to be

a Millionaire? I can safely say

that tonight is the biggest

night of both of our lives,

Ladies and Gentlemen. Jamal

Malik, the Call Centre worker

from Mumbai has already won one

Crore rupees, a cool ten

million. Tonight, he can walk

away with that in his pocket or

make the biggest gamble in

television history and go for

the final question and a

staggering twenty million

rupees! Jamal, are you ready for

that question?

JAMAL

Yes.

The lights dim, the music rumbles. Prem pushes the

lover of literature?

Nervous laughter from the audience. Jamal just shrugs.

Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

Jamal Malik, Call Centre

Assistant from Mumbai, for two

Crore, twenty million rupees,

Musketeer was in the novel by

Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal

to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is

smiling, but disorientated.

PREM (CONT'D)

Ladies and Gentlemen, Jamal

Malik, Crorepati! What a night!

We have all been present at the

making of history, Ladies and

Gentlemen! Jamal Malik,

millionaire!

JAMAL

Latika? Latika?

To ever-increasing roars and applause from the

audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.

191   INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                              191

The line goes dead in Latika's hand. She stares down at

the phone. The bemused family are still eying her like

an alien. She smiles at them and goes out. The traffic

on the road is still grid-locked. She starts walking,

faster and faster. Then she breaks into a run.

192   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                192

A small tv in the bathroom. Salim smiles.

JAVED O/S

Salim! Teri ma ki chute! Salim!

Javed is banging on the door. Salim gets up from where

he has been praying. He climbs into the bath which is

full of bank notes and lies down amongst the money. He

reaches across for the pistol and picks it up. Smiles

slightly as Javed smashes down the door, pulls the

trigger and shoots Javed. He falls onto the floor,

dead. But the Thug right behind him shoots Salim in the

chest. He lies back in the bath, the faintest trace of

a smile on his face as he stares at the pictures of

Jamal on the tv.

SALIM

God is good.

Salim dies.

193   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           193

Prem and Jamal are being posed by photographers. A

giant-sized cheque for twenty million rupees is

manhandled onto the floor by the Floor Manager and an

Assistant amidst much cheering and laughter. Jamal is

snapped next to a scowling Prem. The Inspector appears

next to them.

INSPECTOR

Just one more thing left, Sir.

(CONTINUED)

193   CONTINUED:                                                   193

Prem smiles.

PREM

Finally, huh?

INSPECTOR

If you'd like to come with me.

He takes Jamal by the arm, leads him backstage.

194   INT/EXT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                 194

Jamal sits silent in the back seat next to the

Inspector as he drives through the traffic. Then:

JAMAL

Truth alone triumphs? I should

have known better.

The Inspector stops the jeep. Unlocks the handcuffs.

Holds the back door open for Jamal.

INSPECTOR

Thought you might need a lift,

Sir.

He nods towards the outside world. Dazed, Jamal gets

out.

195   EXT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. NIGHT.                    195

Jamal finds himself    gazing up     at VT station. Slowly, he

wanders inside. The    Inspector     takes the contents of the

file and tears them    slowly in     half. Lets the pieces

fall on the ground.    Gets back     in the jeep and drives

away.

196   OMITTED                                                      196

197   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. NIGHT.                    197

VT station is awash with the evening commute. Thousands

of people crowd the platforms, jostling the only still

figure who is sitting at the base of the statue of

Frederick Stevens. Jamal. Then there is a gap in the

wall of bodies that swirls around him. Jamal gets to

his feet.

JAMAL

Latika?

Then she is gone in the melee again. Only to reappear.

(CONTINUED)

121.

197   CONTINUED:                                            197

LATIKA

Jamal?

Jamal forces himself through the people. Nothing will

stop him. Latika too is shoving them aside until they

are face-to-face. They stop, look at each other, hold

each other's hands tight. The whole station seems

frozen, the only movement from a thousand bodies being

Jamal and Latika.

LATIKA (CONT'D)

I thought we would meet again

only in death.

He shakes his head.

JAMAL

I knew you'd be watching.

Jamal puts his hand on Latika's chin, turns her head

gently so that she is facing him. He sees the knife

scars on her cheek for the first time. She tries to

turn her head, but he won't let her. Runs his hand

slowly down the scar. Rests his hand there.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

This is our destiny.

He gently kisses the scarred cheek.

JAMAL (CONT'D)

This is our destiny.

The camera pulls back and back, rising above the

station. The music starts and the frozen station comes

alive, two thousand kurta-clad men and saree-clad women

dancing in and out and on top of the trains, an unbound

celebration of hope and humanity that has at its

centre, Jamal and Latika.

THE END
