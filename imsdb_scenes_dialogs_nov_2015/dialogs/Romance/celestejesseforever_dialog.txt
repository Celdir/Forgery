While Celeste is dictating, Jesse is getting bored. He starts

looking through the middle console. He finds something. A

melted tube of Chapstick. Ew. Ooh, a cigarette. Jesse lights

the cigarette, takes a drag. Celeste looks at Jesse and

signals to him, "Can I have a drag?"

He hands her the cigarette and she promptly chucks it out the

window.

JESSE

CELESTE

Jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror. He

then looks at his teeth.

JESSE

Celeste just glares at him.

CELESTE

Jesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror.

Celeste throws her hands up in silent celebration.

Jesse signals with his finger, "one minute."

JESSE

Celeste looks at him with anticipation.

CELESTE

JESSE

He looks at her and grabs her hand, with tears in his eyes.

CELESTE

JESSE

Malibu. The waves are peeling out

there.

CELESTE

Is this about surfing? You're

talking about going surfing.

Unbelievable.

JESSE

No, this is best part. Skillz got a

hi-def digital camera and he's

gonna film me!!!

CELESTE

Oh, god.

JESSE

And we're gonna upload it on You

Tube!

CELESTE

I'm not...

JESSE

What? Is that not awesome?

CELESTE

No, yeah, I just thought it was

about the Slate job you interviewed

for.

JESSE

Oh yeah. No. They haven't called

yet. But if they don't think I'm

the right artist to illustrate the

book, then it's not the right job

for me. You know what I mean?

CELESTE

I absolutely do, yes. You are a

wonderful artist. But at some

point, you will show the world that

one day...right?

JESSE

Hey, can I drop you at home now?

Because I just missed a wave.

CELESTE

Well...

JESSE

Wait! I just missed another one.

Celeste and Jesse giggle at their stupid inside joke for a

drops the knife on her plate and buries her head in her

Celeste is genuinely concerned about her friend.

CELESTE

Celeste searches frantically for her book. She peeks around a

corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading "More New

Releases." Three copies of her book, "Shitegeist" appear in

the very bottom row, barely visible. She is disappointed.

She grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the

front of the store.

BETH

Celeste marches to the Oprah's Book Club table and swiftly

replaces the center display book with her own.

All of a sudden, her diamond bracelet slips off her wrist and

plunks to the bottom.

She drops Jesse's journal to the concrete and crawls into the

trash can, still reaching for the bottom, not quite getting

there. The trash can falls over with her in it. Just then,

Jesse's car pulls up and headlights shine on Celeste half-way

in the trash can. She fumbles and then:

A piece of glass from the can has sliced her face. She

immediately wiggles out of the trash can, stands it back up

again. She looks for a place to run. It's too late. She picks

up the journal and hides behind the trash cans but Jesse and

Veronica have been watching her whole opera from the car.

Jesse approaches a crouching Celeste.

Celeste stands up slowly as if nothing is wrong. She is also
