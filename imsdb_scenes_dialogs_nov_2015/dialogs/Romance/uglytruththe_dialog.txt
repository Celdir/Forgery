1   INT. KPHX TV - LOBBY - DAY                                      1

ABBY RICHTER, 30's, pretty, driven and absolutely in control,

walks through the lobby, greeting the SECURITY GUARD.

ABBY

Morning, Freddy.

SECURITY GUARD

Morning, Abby. Another peaceful

day?

ABBY

If you say so...

2   INT. KPHX - CORRIDOR - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER                  2

JOY, 40's, the associate producer, falls in step with Abby.

JOY

(panicked)

We've got problems.

ABBY

There are no problems, Joy.   Only

solutions.

JOY

The sky-cam on the traffic copter

has a cracked lens and they can't

fix it.

ABBY

Okay, that's a problem.

(thinking, then...)

Call Matt Hardwick down at Media

Services. He's got a few Sky Cams

and he owes me. Now, where are my

weathermen?

Joy opens a door to a waiting area.

3   INT. KPHX - WAITING AREA - MORNING - CONTINUOUS                 3

Several portly LATINO MEN look up and wave at Abby.

LATINO MEN

Hey there!

ABBY

Hi, guys!

Abby waves back and closes the door.

ABBY

What's with the pot bellies?

JOY

Research shows people like fat

weathermen. It makes them feel

safe.

ABBY

I like the one in the green and the

one in the brown, but I want to see

the one in the green with less

sideburns and the one in the brown

with more, then I'll make my

decision.

LARRY (O.S.)

Abby!

LARRY, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up to

them. He wears a makeup bib.

ABBY

Morning, Larry.

LARRY

I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby,

but I don't think I can work with

her anymore. It's bad enough I

have to take her criticism at home.

I can't do it on air, too. A man

can only take so much.

Abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done

this before.

ABBY

You're not a man, Larry...

(off his look)

You're a newsman. A newsman isn't

defined by the easy times, Larry,

he's defined by the difficult ones.

Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris

Hansen or Anderson Cooper having

their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no,

because they couldn't handle it.

But you can. You've got balls the

size of Volkswagens. Don't think I

haven't noticed.

LARRY

(re his balls)

I've only thought of them as blue

as of late, but you're right. They

are quite sizeable. But not

disproportionately so.

(with pride)

I like to think of them as

aesthetically pleasing --

Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore

than she has to.

ABBY

I think I've made my point.

Larry nods, appeased, as she reaches the door marked ABBY

RICHTER, PRODUCER, "ALBUQUERQUE A.M." She enters and...

4   INT. KPHX - ABBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                4

...walks in on a shouting match between JOSH, a leftist angry

news writer, and DORI, the entertainment-leaning co-writer.

DORI

Josh, nobody in Sacramento gives a                              *

crap about trees in Alaska! It's

not newsworthy.

JOSH

Oh, but full coverage on David

Beckham's new tattoo is vital?!

Larry's wife and co-anchor, GEORGIA, 40 and coiffed to the

gills, storms in, followed by the show's GUEST CHEF.

GEORGIA

He's trying to kill me! He knows I

can't eat crab, I'm allergic to it!

(to the room)

Does anyone see this? Is this a

hive?

JOSH

It looks like syphilis to me.

DORI

(to Josh)

See that? You wouldn't even know

what syphilis looks like if it

weren't for my story on Paris

Hilton.

GUEST CHEF

(to Abby)

She doesn't eat crab or beef or

fish. She doesn't eat anything but

chicken. You don't need a chef on

this show. You need a box of

McNuggets.

Everyone shouts at each other. Abby calmly pulls out a

whistle, puts it to her mouth and BLOWS.

5   INT. KPHX - "SACRAMENTO AM" SET - MORNING                             5*

Cameras roll as the chef happily cooks away on the set.

Georgia and Larry taste samples of what he's prepared.

GEORGIA

I have to tell you, Bruce. This is

the best Chicken Kiev I've ever

tasted.

GUEST CHEF

Actually it's Duck Kiev. Duck makes

an excellent alternative for

chicken, Georgia.

JAVIER, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite.

JAVIER

Can I take home the leftovers?

They all laugh.

LARRY

When we return, our live Skycam

traffic update and more on David

Beckham's hundred thousand dollar

tattoo.

GEORGIA

And what you can do to help

preserve the ancient forests of

Alaska -- and how it might help

your Albuquerque electric bill.

Abby and Joy stand next to CLIFF, the show's director.

CLIFF

Go to commercial.

(to Abby)

I don't know how you do it.

ABBY

It's just a matter of staring the

chaos in the eye and showing it

who's boss. Nice work, guys.

She pats him on the back and heads out of the control room.

JOY

(to Abby)

Stuart wants to see you. He's

freaking out.

ABBY

(worried)

That means he got the numbers.

7   INT. KPHX - STUART'S OFFICE - DAY                                     7

Abby talks to STUART WARDLOW, 60's, KPHX's curmudgeonly

general manager.

STUART

Have you seen the ratings for

yesterday? We got beat by all the

network shows, plus a rerun of

"Who's the Boss". The one where

the vacuum breaks.

ABBY

It's a temporary setback. This week

we'll do better.

STUART

The guy with the cable access show

on Channel 83 does better. If we

programed Jerry Springer re-runs,

we'd do a nine share at a quarter

the price.

Abby looks worried.

ABBY

Please tell me you're not thinking

of killing the show.

STUART

I'm not, but I can guarantee you

that's what the new management's

thinking.

ABBY

Stuart, "Sacramento AM" is an award-                         *

winning news program.

STUART

Management doesn't listen to

awards. It listens to numbers.

We're not a family-run station

anymore, Abby. You're good at what

you do, but you've got to get me

some numbers. I've got two

daughters in college and a son in

beauty school. I don't know how

much you know about Vidal Sassoon

but that shit ain't cheap.

Abby nods.

ABBY

You can count on me, Stuart.

8   INT. KPHX - WOMEN'S BATHROOM - DAY                                    8*

Abby and Joy stand at the sinks.     Abby compulsively flosses         *

in front of the mirror.                                                *

ABBY

I can't be letting corporate

management dictate the content of

this show. This is my show. I

control it.

She rips out an extra two feet of floss.                               *

ABBY (cont'd)                                   *

I should cancel my date tonight and                       *

make a list of ideas for sweeps.

JOY

Absolutely not. You should be out,

observing humanity. Humanity's who

watches our show.

ABBY

Yeah, all 2.47% of them.

JOY

You've already rescheduled on this

guy three times. You cancel tonight

and he's gone. He's read more than

a dozen books, he has a 401K and

he's cute.

She holds up her clipboard, which has the guy's E-Harmony

PROFILE and PHOTO.

JOY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Look at this bone structure. This

could be the bone structure of your

future children. Don't you want

them to be symmetrical?

ABBY

You printed his profile?

JOY

What? I'm married. I live

vicariously through your dating

life. And I really think that this

could be our next boyfriend. C'mon,

he had nine out of ten items on

your checklist.

ABBY

Well, technically eight and a half.

He said he could cook, but when I

pressed him, he was completely

unfamiliar with cumin. Don't you

think that's a little suspicious?

ABBY

Hi. I'm looking for a guy with

sandy brown hair, athletic build,

and blue eyes... he's 5'9 which --

I know what you're thinking -- it's

a little short, but he's read The

Great Gatsby twice, so we'll just

live with it, okay?

JIM (O.S.)

Technically, I'm 5'9 and 3/4.

But I'll read Gatsby again if that

makes it any better.

ABBY

Jim -- hey. Hi. Hey.

HOSTESS

Shall I show you to your table?

11   INT. RESTAURANT DINING AREA - NIGHT                                11

ABBY

You know what? This is not the best

angle. We should get the table over

there. Then we both get a view,

instead of one of us looking at the

busboy station.

JIM

I'm fine here.

ABBY

No, trust me. It'll be better over

there.

WAITER

Can I get you some water for the

table?

JIM

Bottle of flat, please.

ABBY

You know, they've done studies that

show tap water is no different from

bottled water. And they passed a

law recently to have all

restaurants filter their tap water.

So, technically it's not tap water.

ABBY (cont'd)

It's filtered water, which is

exactly what bottled water is,

except you don't have to pay $7 for

it.

JIM

Yeah, I still like the way it

tastes better.

WAITER

Can I get you any cocktails?

JIM

Scotch on the rocks.

ABBY

In your profile, you said you liked

red wine.

JIM

I do, I just feel like having a

scotch right now.

ABBY

(re the paper)

Was there anything else you changed

your mind about? I mean, just so I

can figure it into the overall

picture.

JIM

You printed out my profile?

ABBY

Actually, my associate producer

did. She likes me to be prepared.

Not that I'm ever not prepared.

Kudos on your comprehensive car

insurance policy, by the way.

JIM

That wasn't in my profile.

ABBY

No, but it was in your background

check.

(off his look; changing

the subject)

So...tell me about yourself.

JIM

Well, what's left that you don't

know?

ABBY

Good point.

ABBY

I printed out some talking points

for us just in case this happened.

JIM

I take it it's happened before?

ABBY

No, but since you have nine out of

ten of the necessary attributes on

my checklist, I just wanted to make

sure this goes as smoothly as

possible.

JIM

Thank you.

ABBY

You realize the ice in that scotch

is made from tap water, don't you?

13   EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT- NIGHT                                13

ABBY

Next time we could go bowling. I

noticed online that you're the mid-

ranked amateur in the state. I

mean, if there is a next time. I'm

not trying to be presumptuous, but

I am getting a pretty good vibe

here...

should go.

ABBY

FYI, be sure to eat this by

tomorrow. With curry, you can't

smell if it's gone bad, so after

three days, you should just toss

it. Really, don't even give it to a

pet or anything.

JIM

Three days. Got it.

ABBY

Here, just to be sure, I'll write

today's date on it for you.

JIM

It's fine, really...

MIKE

I'm Mike Alexander and we're back

with the "The Ugly Truth." Tonight,

as always, we're going to talk

about what it is men and women

really want in relationships. I've

been looking through some books...

MIKE (CONT'D)

"Smart Women Foolish Choices",

"Women Who Love Men Who Hate Them",

"Hating Men Who Love Women But Hate

Loving Men"...

MIKE (CONT'D)

Billions and billions of dollars

wasted on self-help psychobabble.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Now listen up, ladies, cause I'm

only gonna say this once tonight

and it's just three little words.

No, they're not "I love you." Here

goes... MEN. ARE. SIMPLE. We can

not be trained. All this "Men Are

From Venus" bullshit is a waste of

your time and money.

MIKE (CONT'D)

You want to be a lonely hag, then

keep reading these stupid books.

You want a relationship, here's how

you get one: it's called a

Stairmaster. Get on it and get

skinny and get some trashy lingerie

because at the end of the day, all

we're interested in is looks. No

one falls in love with your

personality at first sight, they

fall in love with your tits and

your ass. And they stick around

because of what you're willing to

do with them. You want to win a man

over? You don't need ten steps. You

need one. And it's called a blow-

job.

MIKE (CONT'D)

MIKE

Men don't fall in love. Men fall in

"want." We want things. We're

hunters and gatherers. We're the

same as we were when we were

cavemen and a gillion years of

evolution hasn't done squat. Trust

me, there was a Pamela Anderson of

cave women and all the cave guys

were trying to stick their dicks in

her.

MIKE (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Now girls, if you want to think

lust is the same as love, that's

fine, but you're delusional. Let's

take some more calls.

(picks up the phone)

You're on the air.

ABBY

So you're saying men are incapable

of love?

MIKE

Did I burst your little Harlequin

Romance bubble?

ABBY

The only thing you burst is your

credibility. Men are absolutely

capable of experiencing love.

What?

MIKE

The guy, Mr. Wonderful, the one

who's so capable of love. Who is

he? What's he like?

ABBY

Well, he's not like you, that's for

sure.

MIKE

Thank you very much. Go on.

ABBY

He's smart...he's handsome but

doesn't know it...

(enjoying the fantasy)

He's successful, but in a job that

means something. He loves red wine,

classical music, Cary Grant

movies...

MIKE

This is a guy in America, right?

You're not calling from Europe or

anything.

ABBY

Are you interested in listening or

not?

MIKE

No, please. I'm loving this.

ABBY

He works out, not because he's

vain, because it's healthy. He's

socially liberal but fiscally

conservative. He likes dogs but

he's a cat person. He never gets

out of bed before you on a Sunday

morning --

MIKE

Oh my god. You're a lesbian!

ABBY

What?!

ABBY

Why are those qualities so

threatening to you? Perhaps because

your complete lack of any one of

them is the real reason why women

aren't interested in you. At least

women of quality.

MIKE

Where is this guy? I will give you

one hundred dollars of my own money

to bring him down here and let me

meet him.

ABBY

Oh, he's out there...somewhere.

MIKE

Wait a second. You're not even

dating this guy?!

ABBY

Well, no...I'm just describing a

type...I thought that's what we

were doing.

MIKE

You don't even know him?!?

MIKE (CONT'D)

Hold on...whoa...now I get the

whole picture. You're a dog.

ABBY

Excuse me?

MIKE

You heard me. You must be. If you

were hot, you'd be out breaking

some poor schmuck's heart instead

of spending all your time

fantasizing about Mr. Wonderful.

Face it, you're ugly!

Well, of course you don't think so.

Ugly people never know they're

ugly. It's like people who have

B.O. They never know it because

they're surrounded by their own

stench all the time.

ABBY

That is the most ridic --

MIKE

Look, lemme help you out here. You

might as well just face the fact

that you're gonna be alone and stop

pining away for some fantasy guy

you're never going to get. Get a

hobby. Build housing for the poor.

Anything.

ABBY

How could you possibly --

MIKE

Hey, Lassie -- the show's called

"The Ugly Truth". If you can't face

it, don't call.

(switching gears)

Well that about wraps it up for

Morning, everybody.

STUART

Now before I play this, I have to

warn you...

(hits play)

...he's a little rough around the

edges.

MIKE (ON T.V.)

Face it, you're ugly!

ABBY'S VOICE (O.S.)

I am not ugly!

JOY

Is that you?

ABBY

What?! No!

MIKE (ON T.V.)

Ugly people never know they're

ugly. It's like people who have

B.O.--

ABBY

Why are we watching this?!

STUART

One word. Ratings. Say hello to our

new guest commentator. I'm starting

him with two segments a week. Three

minutes a pop.

ABBY

Are you kidding me?

STUART

His name is Mike Alexander.

ABBY

And he's a    quintessential

misogynist    uber-moron who

represents    everything wrong with

television    and society at large...

DORI

I get crap every time I suggest we

do something even remotely fluffy

and now you're gonna put this

douchebag on the air?

STUART

He's got a point of view. We don't

have to like him, we're news

people. We're objective. Stone

Phillips interviews terrorists,

doesn't mean he likes them. It's

good for ratings.

ABBY

I've got a whole list of ideas on

how to improve ratings. We don't

need him.

STUART

A live debate on immigration

policy? Never work.

ABBY

What are you talking about?

Albuquerque is 45% Latino.

MIKE

Yeah, and as you can tell by all

the screaming rugrats in this town,

Latino guys like to have a lot of

sex. Which means they'd rather

listen to me tell them how to bang

hot chicks than hear about why they

can't bring grandma across the

border.

MIKE

Hey, no hard feelings, right?

MIKE

You know, if it weren't for you, I

would have never gotten this gig.

You and I make good TV.

ABBY

I'm sorry, what channel is your

show on?

MIKE

Eighty three.

ABBY

This is channel two. You do know

that the lower numbers are better,

right? More people watch. So don't

tell me that "you and I" make good

TV. I am an award-winning news

producer. I make good TV. You make

imbecilic trash watched by

housebound inbreds who are so busy

putting their hands down their

pants they're unable to change the

channel.

That's just what we need on this

LARRY

Does anyone think my highlights are

too shiny?

ABBY

Larry, listen to me. I want Mike

Alexander to go down in flames. I

want Mike Alexander to be nothing

but a pile of ash on the seat next

to you. I want the janitor to come

in with his Dustbuster and vacuum

up the ashes of Mike Alexander, and

then when he throws the ashes into

the dumpster outside, I want the

rats to vomit and then defecate on

the ashes of Mike Alexander.

LARRY

And I thought you were angry and

bitter.

GEORGIA

Uh, no, that would be my untouched

GEORGIA

For years, there have been concerns

about lowering television

standards. But many believe that

this man and his local public

brought things to a new low. With

that, we welcome Mike Alexander.

MIKE

How ya doing, guys?

LARRY

Mike, how do you respond to those

who say your show is offensive?

MIKE

It is... but then again, so is the

truth.

What relationships are really like.

watching you on TV. You used to be

this cool confident cat. Georgia's

no dumb bunny. She knew the only

way she was getting off the weekend

But then lo and behold, she became

more popular than you and ended up

with twice your salary.

Bullllloney you are. You hate her

manhood.

GEORGIA

What's your point, Mr. Alexander?

ABBY

Good girl, Georgia. Take control.

MIKE

My point? My point is that your

husband hasn't had sex with you

in...I'm gonna say. . .three

months?

LARRY

That's not my fault!

MIKE

I know, it's her fault!

GEORGIA

Why is it my fault?!

ABBY

Oh, dear God.

GEORGIA

Well, what am I supposed to do,

give up the money, so he can get an

erection?

MIKE

I agree. You've economically

emasculated your husband to such a

point that he's afraid to desire

you. Sure, you can dump his ass,

but honey, have you seen the

eligible men in Albuquerque? It's

slim pickings out there for a woman

in her forties. You're not going to

do any better than Larry. You just

have to let him be a man. LET HIM

ABBY

You're not touching my hair until I

know exactly what you're going to

do with it.

MIKE

We're giving you bedhead.

ABBY

Why would I want bedhead?

MIKE

Bedhead is sexy.

(re her current hairdo)

A ponytail implies that you are

either operating heavy machinery or

emptying the litter box. Neither of

these things inspires an erection.

ABBY (O.S.)

I just don't want to be perceived

as a bimbo.

MIKE

I don't want you to be a bimbo. You

need to be two people, the saint

and the sinner, the librarian and

the stripper. It's a delicate

balance. On one hand, you have to

push the guy away with cold

indifference and yet on the other

hand be a sexually teasing tornado.

ABBY

Well just don't sit there. Say

something.

MIKE

Glasses.

Huh?

MIKE

You need glasses.

ABBY

But I wear contacts. Besides,

doesn't the woman usually remove

glasses during a makeover?

MIKE

Yeah, but we're going for a

stripperlibrarian thing. Right

now, I wouldn't trust you to find

me a book.

MIKE (CONT'D)

Not bad. Now we need to practice

flirting.

ABBY

I know how to flirt.

MIKE

Do you want to be an old maid?

ABBY

So, if I don't listen to you, I'll

be an old maid?

MIKE

(acting old)

"My name's Abby and I'm arthritic

and alone. I have eighteen cats who

keep me company."

ABBY

Oh, ha ha. That's very funny.

"Hey babe, what's wrong with a

little ass grabbing?"

(continuing to pinch his

ass)

"I mean what's the point of you

even having one unless it's there

for me to grab it? You're just a

set of orifices and a pair of tee-

tas."

MIKE

You're a deeply, deeply disturbed

person.

ABBY

Maybe I'm just a good student.

MIKE

Would you stop doing that?

ABBY

Doing what?

MIKE

Touching me with your finger.

Hi. Wow, you look great.

DR. LESTER

Of all primates, Bonobos are the

closest relatives to human beings,

both genetically and socially -

especially when it comes to sex.

For the Bonobo, sex is a way to

ease stress and diffuse tensions.

So summing up Bonobo-land, the

chicks look great, get freaky in

bed and in turn, they get to sit on

their asses and boss their men

around all day.

teaser campaign we're starting next

week.

(to Harold)

You're going to love this.

MIKE

Yeah, Abby. Tell us about the

teasers.

ABBY

Well, it's fifteen seconds...each

hour.

ABBY (cont'd)

They're very -- oh!

ABBY (cont'd)

Mike! -- Wait! You -- tell them.

MIKE

Actually, I'm really enjoying the

way you're telling them.

Mike telling an Ugly Truth

No, just part of the time. Figured

Seriously, thanks for coming

tonight. I mean, you know, to

HAROLD

Keep up the good work, Mike.

BOB

And thanks for introducing us to

our future ex-wives.

MIKE

You kids play safe.

MIKE

So, what's next? A little three-way

Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

That's a trait to be admired, not

mocked, man-whore.

MIKE

Who says I'm a man-whore?

ABBY

I've seen you with the Funbag

Twins, remember?

MIKE

You saw me what? Take them to

dinner and introduce them to some

network executives? They want to be

actresses. Who am I to kill their

dreams?

ABBY

You're telling me you've never

slept with those girls?

MIKE

I didn't say that...

ABBY

Exactly my point. Man-whores want

women who wear slutty clothes and

suck lots of cock.

MIKE

Every man wants that. And for your

information, I was only with the

one who can read.

(then)

Did you just say cock?

ABBY

What? I can say cock. You don't own

that word. Cock. There. I said it

again.

MIKE

A week ago you cried at the thought

of a vibrator. Now you're all "cock

this,""cock that."

(then)

You had sex with Colin, didn't you?

ABBY

NO! We're saving that for this

weekend. He's taking me to Santa

Fe.

ABBY

Of course I'm ready.

You don't sound ready.

Here's to overturning assumptions.

I'm really a man of discriminating

taste and you're a foul-mouthed

MIKE

So there you have it. Never assume

a girl is easy, or assume she's a

prude. There are many layers in

between and it's your job,

gentlemen, to peel back those

layers and figure out exactly what

type of woman you are dealing with.

JOY

What happened to him? That sounded

almost enlightened.

MIKE

Because once you do peel back those

layers, my friends, her lady garden

awaits. And I'm pretty sure you're

gonna want to fertilize that patch

of petunias. And that there is the

Ugly Truth.

the case.

Really? Colin's penis? That's what

you want to talk about right now? I

was thinking maybe we should talk

about what you're gonna say on the

show.

(doing Jay)

So, tell me Mike. How did "The Ugly

Truth" start?

MIKE

Well, Jay, I had a sales job where

I drove around a lot, listening to

talk radio. I started calling in

and lo and behold, people liked

what I had to say. Then I decided

what the hell, I need my own show.

I have a message people need to

hear.

enriched by your wisdom.

MIKE

Excuse me, lady, but you have a

It may have started because of you,

but it's lasted because of me.

MIKE

So, you've been acting like your

normal control freak psycho self in

front of him?

ABBY

I'm not a control freak.

MIKE

When you checked into the hotel,

did you or did you not insist on

getting an "Eastern-facing" room on

"a floor not below seven"?

ABBY

I like rising with the sun. And a

view.

MIKE

My point is, Colin likes the Mike

version of Abby, not the Abby

version of Abby. So, don't go

knocking my words of wisdom when

you're living proof that they work.

I could be having sex right now --

Yeah, thanks to me.

So what's your number one piece of

advice to all the people out there

who are trying to find love?

MIKE

Don't do it. Try to find lust

instead. It's a lot easier and a

lot less messy. Blue balls only

last a few hours. A broken heart

can last years.

JAY

So, what's her name?

MIKE

Who?

JAY

The girl who screwed you up. She

must have been a doozy.

MIKE

Like I said, better a floozy than a

doozy.

JAY

Well, what do you say to guys like

me who have been happily married

for twenty-seven years? We can't be

the exception to the rule, can we?

There's plenty of us out there.

Marriage starts off great. She's

cute, you're cute, the world's

Then, ten years later, she's put on

twenty pounds, you've got nose

hair, you're voting for different

presidents, and one day, the

receptionist at Jiffy Lube

accidentally grazes your hand as

she hands you back your keys and

you realize that's the first time a

woman's touched you in three

months. By year twenty, you've

learned to completely tune out the

sound of her voice and it occurs to

you that ever since you walked down

the aisle, you're living with

someone who can barely tolerate

your presence and, on the rare

occasion that you actually do make

love, she probably thinks about

Jake Gyllenhaal.

Sorry, about that. He was upset

about his performance on Leno.

COLIN

No worries. The rest of the night

is ours.

COLIN (cont'd)

To the first of many romantic

evenings to come.

COLIN (cont'd)

Whoa --

ABBY

Why do you like me?

COLIN

Well, you're beautiful, you're

smart --

COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)

You're open, you laugh at my jokes,

you never criticize...

COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)

You never try to control the

situation, and I've got to say,

it's a breath of fresh air. A lot

of women I know are total control

freaks -- and it's a nightmare. I

love that you're not like that.

You know what? I am like that.

To be honest, I didn't like the way

you poured the wine. I would have

decanted it. And I was editing that

speech as you were giving it.

ABBY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

Plus, this bed should be facing

north-south instead of east-west!

COLIN

(confused)

Are you serious?

ABBY

I haven't been myself for one

ABBY

Morning, Freddy.

The security guard just looks at her and shakes his head,

disappointed. Stuart rushes up to her.

STUART

I thought you said we had him.

ABBY

What are you talking about?

STUART

He quit this morning. I got a smug

call from Channel 4 saying they

closed a deal with him. Corporate's

having a shit fit. What the hell

happened?

Abby is hurt and stunned, but overcomes it with fierce and

abiding hatred.

ABBY

We don't need Mike Alexander. He's

a dime a dozen.

STUART

You better hope so, because you're

going to find me a new one by the

notes on a clipboard.

ABBY

Yes. No. Yes. No. No.

(then)

I can't believe I even considered

for a second allowing myself to

Channel 4's brighter and more expensive stage, with a

prominent logo for "MORNING MAYHEM WITH MIKE!"

Mike, dressed in an Armani suit, glandhands the Channel 4

suits, as they show him around.

BIG WIG

What do you think of the new set?

MIKE

Love it.

BIG WIG #2

KPHX retained the copyright to your

old segment title, so we retitled

you "Morning Mayhem with Mike!"

Mike's on autopilot.

MIKE

Love it.

BIG WIG

And this is Joe, your new producer.

Mike finally wakes up a bit.     Turns to Joe, a balding

nebbish.

MIKE

You know what I like best about

you, Joe? I don't want to have sex

Mike, in his suit, walks up the front steps. Jonah sits on a

lawn chair, drinking a soda and watching --

IN THE NEARBY VALLEY

Hundreds of multi-colored, multi-shaped HOT AIR BALLOONS are

aloft.

JONAH

Dude, check it out. Balloon Fiesta.

MIKE

Yep.

JONAH

Why do you look like a lawyer?

MIKE

New station. New wardrobe.

JONAH

You're never going to get any pussy

looking like that.

MIKE

(annoyed)

Where do you get this stuff?

JONAH

From you.

MIKE

Look at me, Jonah. I'm 38, I'm

still single, I live alone... Does

it look like it's all working out?

If there's one thing you don't want

to be, it's like me.

As he opens the door and goes inside, Jonah calls out --

JONAH

I'm pretty sure you don't want to

open your new show with that.

How's my skin? Too shiny?     How are

JOY

Tiny.

JACK MAGNUM

Which side is better? Left? Right?

Full-frontal?

Joy looks at Abby, a little worried.

ABBY

They're all fine. But let's go

over your intro.

(prompting him)

"I'm Jack Magnum and this is..."

JACK MAGNUM

The Ugly Truth!

He fake-smiles and does the "point-and-shoot", going so far

as to blow the smoke off his fingertip gun.

ABBY

Oh-kay.   Let's maybe lose the gun.

JACK MAGNUM

What?   The gun is my signature

move.

ABBY

(impatient)

Unless the NRA is paying your

mortgage this month, I say lose the

fucking gun.

JONAH

Dude, check this out. Your

replacement's on.

MIKE

My what?

Mike looks over to see --

ON THE TV -- Live footage from the Balloon Fiesta. Jack

Magnum continues to alienate his audience.

JACK MAGNUM

Most of you are watching this show

so you can learn how to get chicks.

Let me assure you, you're in good

hands. You're looking at a guy

who's personally had sex with over

137 women. Most of them conscious.

ON TV -- Jack Magnum just makes it worse.

JACK MAGNUM (ON T.V.)

We're here at the Balloon Fiesta,

and I'm supposed to be telling you

men are full of hot air, but I

think we all know, it's the ladies

that are full of crap. Just because

she says no, doesn't mean she means

no.

At this Jack Magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon

basket. After a moment --

A frazzled ABBY pops up in his place.

ABBY (ON T.V.)

(nervous)

Hi! I'm sorry, but Jack Magnum will

no longer be able to do "The Ugly

Truth" segment. Which should really

come as no surprise. Because men

are completely unreliable.

Abby stands in the basket, still nervous, but flying on

adrenaline. Joy gives her a "keep going" hand gesture.

ABBY

Take Mike Alexander, for instance.

He up and quit the show without so

much as a word. You think you know

what men are going to do, you think

you know what they want to do...but

when it comes down to the moment

where they actually have to nut up,

they turn around and do something

completely different.

ABBY

The big, strong, romantic men we've

been reading about in novels and

watching in movies since we were

nine? They're fallacies. "Blue

Lagoon" is a total freakin' lie.

Men are not strong. Men are not

brave. Men are afraid.

ABBY

Even if they have a moment in a

hotel elevator that's totally

romantic and filled with potential,

men are completely incapable of

copping to it. Because men are

weak.

MIKE (O.S.)

Let me tell you something about

women.

She turns to see --

MIKE standing there. He pushes past Joy and climbs into the

balloon. Grabbing the mic from Abby's hand.

ABBY

Hey --

MIKE

(ignoring her; to camera)

Women would have us believe that

they are the victims. They aren't.

They want us to think that we break

their hearts for sport. That's

crap. They say they want romance.

They say they want true love, but

all they want is a checklist. Is he

perfect? Is he handsome? Is he a

doctor?

That is not true.

BY THE CAMERAMAN, Joy shrugs.

JOY

Well, kinda true.

Mike continues his rant.

MIKE

You men that fit the criteria --

don't kid yourselves. They're not

sleeping with you. They're sleeping

with a carefully calculated set of

venal choices. Money over

substance. Looks over soul. Polish

over principles. No gesture, no

matter how real or romantic, will

ever compensate for a really

impressive list of credentials.

ABBY

Says the man who's never made a

gesture except for this one --

She makes the universally known "jack-off" hand gesture.

MIKE

So, the elevator wasn't a gesture?

ABBY

The elevator was a moment of

passion, followed by a moment of

panic on your part, apparently.

MIKE

Well, that wasn't panic,

sweetheart. It was an unwillingness

to compete with the walking

checklist that was in your bed. You

should be thanking me.

NEARBY, Joy taps her watch.

JOY

We have ten seconds.

An OVERZEALOUS BALLOON PILOT walks up.

PILOT

Are we ready to soar up, up and

away?

IN THE BASKET, Mike looks at the camera.

MIKE

And that's the Ugly Truth, folks. A

girl in heat for two guys will

always pick the one with the better

resume.

BEHIND HIM, the Pilot silently boards the balloon.

ABBY

That is bullsh --

The TORCH of the BALLOON is suddenly fired, covering her FBC

violation.

The cameraman follows the balloon as it slowly starts to

Abby and Mike spin around to look at him.       Realizing the

ABBY

Where are we going?!

MIKE

I'm not going anywhere with you.

Mike starts to climb out.

ABBY

What a shock. You're bailing.

PILOT

I wouldn't recommend that...

Mike looks down to see --

They are now FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. And rising.         He

MIKE

Hey! I know -- we can pass the time

you and Colin had having sex in Los

Angeles.

ABBY

I broke up with Colin in Los

Angeles, jackass.

Mike is thrown, turning to look at her.

MIKE

What?

To our left, we have the Sandia

Mountains, glistening in the

Abby ignores the pilot.

Oh, that got your interest? If you

I am not a psycho.

MIKE

I just told you I loved you and all

ABBY

The definition of neurotic is a

person who suffers from anxiety,

obsessional thoughts, compulsive

acts and physical ailments without

having any objective evidence of

disease --

MIKE

Again, I just told you I'm in love

with you and you're standing here

giving me a vocabulary lesson.

Back me up on this, buddy...who

You're in love with me.      Really.

Why?

MIKE

Beats the shit out of me, but I am.

Abby opens her mouth, about to make a retort, then realizes

what's been said to her. For the first time in her life, she

As many of you know, sometimes a

took way too long to realize he was

in love.

(holds up a finger)

Let's continue this conversation in

a second.

WE PULL BACK to REVEAL --

Mike is standing in a garden with rows and rows of WEDDING

GUESTS seated behind him. An altar with flowers and a

minister wait patiently.

Mike gestures for the camera to follow him as he makes his

way up to the altar.

As he arrives he greets his groomsman, JONAH, also wearing a

tux. He only has eyes for Joy, Abby's bridesmaid.

JONAH

(to Joy)

Has anyone ever told you you have a

stupendous bosom?

JOY

Not lately, so feel free to say it

again.

A string quartet's version of "HERE COMES THE BRIDE" begins,

as we PAN OVER to see --

ABBY, in a wedding dress, about to make her way up the aisle.

Looking absolutely beautiful.

MIKE

(wowed; to camera)

Zoom in on this, guys. I want the

whole city to see how lucky I am.

The cameraman ZOOMS IN on Abby, as she catches Mike's eye and

smiles.

IN THE AUDIENCE, Elizabeth takes photo after photo. Her date

-- a dead ringer for Jim Morrison -- looks at her, amused.

ELIZABETH

What? No one's ever going to

believe this. I need proof.

AT THE ALTAR, Abby finally arrives and looks at Mike.

ABBY

(re the cameras)

What's this?

MIKE

Hope you don't mind, but we're

live.

ABBY

(re the cameraman)

No, what's Jorge doing so close?

We need a master.

MIKE

(surprised)

You knew about this?

ABBY

Hello...I'm the producer. It's

sweeps week. How do you think I

got them to pay for this?

She gestures to -- BOB and HAROLD from Corporate, who sit in

the audience.

Mike looks momentarily surprised, then --

MIKE

God, I love you.

He turns to the camera.

MIKE

So, here it is, guys. The games,

the manipulation, the ploys, the

tactics... all the things we do to

think we're in control. But guess

what? We never are.

Abby leans over his shoulder.

ABBY

(to the camera)

Isn't it beautiful?

She smiles as we --

CUT TO BLACK.
