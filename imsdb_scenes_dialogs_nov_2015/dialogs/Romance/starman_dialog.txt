DRAFT SCRIPT

GUARD

(an edge of fear in

his voice)

It's coming up... Slow down...

(he points out between

them)

There, right there...

OFFICER

(startled)

Benny, God, take it easy...

BENNY (GUARD)

I don't want to scare them away.

SECOND OFFICER

Smells smoke...

BENNY

I told you.

BENNY

(loud whisper)

There!! Up on the hill!!

BENNY

Right in line with that burning tree.

OFFICER

I don't see anything.

BENNY

It's there. The fog's thicker now,

but it's there. What do you think

started those fires?

OFFICER

Benny, there's nothing there.

BENNY

There is. They came out of the belly

of the ship and then went to the

first terrace and flew down into the

houses.

OFFICER

Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...

OFFICER

You hear that, Mike? Now he's telling

us...

MIKE (SECOND OFFICER)

What's that?

BENNY

What did I tell you?

OFFICER

Probably kids.

MIKE

(not convinced)

Probably...

BENNY

Don't you think you should call a

backup?

OFFICER

No, we can handle this.

OFFICER

(over outside speakers)

This is the police. Identify

yourselves.

BENNY

(to the officers, his

voice cracking)

There's one over here...

BENNY

Stop!! Police!!

MIKE

(in Benny's direction)

What happened?

BENNY

I think I shot one.

MIKE

Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?

OFFICER

You see anything, Mike?

OFFICER

This is the police. Identify

yourselves.

BENNY

(shouts to the officers)

You wanna give me some help over

here.

MIKE

Okay...

OFFICER

Mike, call for back-up.

(shouting)

Benny, you all right?

BENNY

I don't think so...

(clutching his shoulder)

OFFICER

(waving the beam of

his flashlight, shouts)

Benny, this is me. I'm going to take

a look.

BENNY

Don't leave me. I'm coming.

SUBTITLE

Lander four to Mapmaker Wind. Fix

position for rescue. Repeat. Fix

position for rescue.

PARTNER

What the hell was it anyway?

DRIVER

Damned if I know.

PARTNER (V.O.)

Come on. I'm getting wet.

DRIVER (V.O.)

It musta been a bird.

PARTNER (V.O.)

How about if I drive now?

MAN

(around a cigarette)

Major Aaron Bell...

SHERMIN

Marc Shermin, National Security

Agency.

SHERMIN

This has always been my favorite

time of day.

MAJOR BELL (MAN)

Very beautiful country up here...

SHERMIN

Any signs of biological contamination,

excessive radiation, anything like

that?

MAJOR BELL

Not on the landscape. We're trying

to get a tube under the faceplate

for a reading on possible deadly

lifeforms but it's hard going.

SHERMIN

Can you see under the faceplate?

MAJOR BELL

No.

SHERMIN

There's a good chance you could be

wrong about this thing then...

MAJOR BELL

Wait'll you see it.

MAJOR BELL

We had a flight of F16's play tag

with the spaceship over Michigan for

an hour. Then it shot straight up

and disappeared.

SHERMIN

Was there visual contact?

MAJOR BELL

No, sir. Radar.

SHERMIN

It could have been anything.

MAJOR BELL

After I called in, I had a chance to

sit down with the three locals. They

swear there's another one that didn't

make the ship... It might be alive.

SHERMIN

People have made mistakes in these

situations before.

MAJOR BELL

I've been investigating sightings

for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin.

This one's real. We have a dead extra-

terrestrial in that tent and another

one in the area that might be alive.

We've been visited. It's finally

happened and the sooner Washington

accepts that and starts figuring out

how we're going to deal with these

beings, the better off we're going

to be.

MAJOR BELL

Look at the hands.

SHERMIN

Oh, Jesus.

MAJOR BELL

(moving toward the

body)

We better get it into the box. Come

on...

SUBTITLE

Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

SHERMIN

(incredulous)

The other one is alive!

STAR MAN

(subtitle)

Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

STAR MAN

Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

STAR MAN

Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

LYMAN

Is it for real?

SHERMIN

Get Fox.

SHERMIN

(before Fox can speak)

It's real, George.

FOX

There's no mistake? You're absolutely

sure?

SHERMIN

I saw it with my own eyes. We've

killed an extraterrestrial and...

FOX

Is there any possibility that it's a

hoax? Could you be mistaken?

SHERMIN

None. And there's another one in the

area that's alive. I don't know if

it's the only one. I don't know if

it was left here by accident or it's

part of an inva...

FOX

Get the body out of there. Load it

on the Air Force chopper and get it

to Wright Patterson. They'll take it

from there... We didn't expect this,

Shermin.

SHERMIN

(answering the

accusation)

Neither did I.

FOX

We're going... Damn!

(he shakes his head

in disbelief)

We'll tell the press that there was

an accident. Chemical warfare spill.

That cover cannot be violated in any

way. Understand me, Shermin?

MAJOR BELL

Major Bell here, sir. We have to

tell these people that we're friendly.

That this whole thing was a mistake.

Is anyone trying to contact the ship?

FOX

(ignores this)

Shermin, I want you and Bell to start

looking for the one on the ground.

SHERMIN

We'll need a lot of help, George.

You could hide an army up here.

FOX

I'm going to the White House right

now. I'll try and get you everything

you need.

SHERMIN

Wait, wait... What are my orders if

we find this thing?

FOX

Contain it and get back to me.

SHERMIN

What do you mean by 'contain?'

FOX

Just what I said.

VOICES

It was great to have you back... The

kids loved it. We loved it. You're

doing the right thing...

JENNY

I hope so... We'll see... See you

tomorrow... Bye. Bye.

VOICE

(as the Volvo backs

out of the driveway)

Remember you're required to have a

lesson planned tomorrow.

STAR MAN

(subtitles)

Iron channel message. Suit and rockets

destroyed. Radical mixture of this

atmosphere and ours in helmet allowed

chemo-ion response time to adapt my

body to this air. Am going to attempt

extreme transformation in order to

cross land mass to site of our

practice landings. If transformation

is not fatal, second message ball by

next darkness.

SHERMIN

Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a

little league game tomorrow.

LYMAN

I wouldn't worry about it... There

might not be any little league

tomorrow.

MAJOR BELL

I'm telling you they're probably

friendly.

LYMAN

Then why did they try and sneak in

the back door? Tell me that. Why

didn't they contact us first and

say...

RADAR TECHNICIAN

(loud)

UFO coming out of the grass.

SHERMIN

Lock in.

RADAR TECHNICIAN

Got it.

LYMAN

This is crazy. What were we going to

do if that had been the ship? We

have two thirty calibre machine guns,

three M16's and some handguns.

SHERMIN

Give it a rest, Lyman.

MAJOR BELL

(after a pause)

I've never once heard of anybody

being hurt by an extraterrestrial...

LYMAN

That's because the ones that were

hurt, died. They couldn't talk to

you.

SHERMIN

(to technician, after

a look at Lyman)

Any reports about monsters, people

in Halloween masks, anything like

that?

TECHNICIAN

No, but there sure were a lot of

people who saw lights in the sky

last night. Reports are still coming

in.

MAJOR BELL

(under above)

I've heard of blood being drawn,

sometimes they were taken for a ride

in the ship, a lot of times they

said they had sex... But nobody was

ever hurt...

LYMAN

But you decided those weren't real.

This one is.

LYMAN

(over his shoulder to

Shermin)

Fox.

FOX

I've got something for you.

FOX

Recognize this?

MAJOR BELL

It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent

into space on the Pioneer probes.

FOX

Houston found it in the

extraterrestrial's suit.

MAJOR BELL

They must have picked it up in space.

SHERMIN

Then it's not an accident that they

found us.

FOX

We don't think that's necessarily

bad. At least it's a point of contact.

SHERMIN

Not necessarily bad! If they knew we

were here why didn't they let us

know they were coming?

FOX

We'll get those answers when you

find the one you're looking for.

SHERMIN

That's not going to happen, George,

unless you get us the help you

promised us.

FOX

We've been back and forth on this

all day and keeping in mind the panic

that would occur if this got to the

general public, it's been decided

not to expand the search at this

time.

SHERMIN

Don't let them do it this way, George.

It's too important. We can't find

this thing alone.

FOX

You have to. We're trying to contact

the ship. If we do, I'll let you

know immediately. Good luck.

RADAR TECHNICIAN

You get the feeling we're expendable?

SHERMIN

We always were.

STAR MAN

(practicing the human

sound)

Wehave...

(more precise)

Wehave...

(well-formed)

Wehave...

JENNY

(faint through the

glass)

Damn!

STAR MAN

(precise)

Wehave...

STAR MAN

Wehave...

JENNY

Please don't hurt me... please...

please.

JENNY

(hysteria creeping

into her voice)

It's got to be here... it's got to

be here...

JENNY

(in a small voice)

No... please don't...

DISSOLVE TO:

DR. BERGEN

The creature was hit three times...

DR. BERGEN

...the arm, the abdomen and the upper

chest, the one in the chest being

the cause of death. It shattered,

for want of a better term, the

creature's backbone. It's not really,

because it's not jointed. It's simply

a hollow shaft of very pliable

silicate material, as is its entire

endoskeleton. The creature seems to

have tremendous regenerative powers.

Although it must have died within

minutes of receiving the fatal wound,

the arm and abdomen wounds are almost

totally healed and the bullet here...

(indicates with the

light)

has begun to dissolve...

DR. BERGEN

It has veins but no blood. We think,

and this is just speculation, that

some form of energy flows from the

brain, which is much more

sophisticated than ours, throughout

the rest of the body... We don't

think there is any danger of bacterial

contamination. Our biochemistries

are too different...

DR. BERGEN (V.O.)

The flesh is gelatinous, the skin is

very porous and very moist. This is

another guess, but it probably comes

from a planet that receives only

reflected light, perhaps from a ring

of moons. Its atmospheric pressure

is slightly less than ours and it

contains a great deal more water...

FOX (V.O.)

Dr. Bergen, George Fox here in

Washington. Can you give us an idea

of why they're here?

DR. BERGEN (V.O.)

They're so advanced... I... eh...

can't imagine what they would want

from us. I know they could be

dangerous. But they could also be

the greatest thing that ever happened

to mankind...

STAR MAN

Please...

JENNY

Don't... don't do this... please...

JENNY

(struggles to free

herself)

You're hurting me. Stop.

JENNY

Oh, God, no! I'm not leaving this

house with you. You're going to hurt

me, I know...

JENNY

(through tears)

I can't. I'd like to help. You look

like Scott, but I know you're not. I

don't know what you are. You gotta

understand, I'm afraid of you...

STAR MAN

Please.

JENNY

Why are you doing this to me? I'll

give you whatever...

STAR MAN

Please...

JENNY

Which way do you want to go?

JENNY

You can go that way...

(points left)

That way...

(straight ahead)

That way...

STAR MAN

(measured)

That way.

JENNY

(staring incredulously

at the compass)

God, what are you?

JENNY

(starting the engine)

I'm sorry...

JENNY

That green dot, that's us, isn't

it... and the red's where you want

to go?... You don't understand me,

do you?

JENNY

(to herself)

I gotta get out of here.

JENNY

(startled)

What?

STAR MAN

(thinking the steering

wheel is called

'what," he repeats)

What.

JENNY

(realizing her mistake)

Ah... no...

STAR MAN

(repeats)

Ah no.

JENNY

(enunciates)

Steering wheel...

STAR MAN

(correcting her)

What.

JENNY

Steering wheel.

STAR MAN

(repeats)

Steering wheel.

JENNY

(points to the gear

shift)

Gear shift.

STAR MAN

Gear shift.

JENNY

(slaps the dashboard)

Dashboard.

STAR MAN

Dashboard.

STAR MAN

(alarmed)

What?!

JENNY

Eh... police.

STAR MAN

(remembering)

Police...

JENNY

(raps on the steering

wheel)

What?...

JENNY

Steering wheel...

(she points to the

gear shift)

What?

STAR MAN

(unprompted, points

correctly at each

item)

Steering wheel... gear shift...

dashboard...

JENNY

(this frightens Jenny

even more)

Good.

STAR MAN

Good.

JENNY (V.O.)

Which way?

STAR MAN (V.O.)

That way.

STAR MAN (V.O.)

Good.

STAR MAN

What?

JENNY

(distant)

Flashlight.

STAR MAN

What?

JENNY

Coupons.

STAR MAN

What?

JENNY

(curt)

Pancakes.

STAR MAN

Pancakes.

STAR MAN

What?

STAR MAN

What?

MAN

You stupid son of a bitch!!

JENNY

(screaming)

Help me!!

MAN

You could have killed us both!!

JENNY

(battling to maintain

her grip on the door

frame)

He's kidnapping me!!!

MAN

Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...

JENNY

Call the police!!

MAN

(not sure he wants to

get involved)

Hey buddy... let her go...

JENNY

Help me!!!

MAN

(grabbing her other

arm)

Hey, she doesn't want to go with

you. Come on.

MAN

Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My

mistake... I'm sorry...

JENNY

He doesn't understand... just walk

away...

MAN

I promise I'm not going to tell

anybody about this... None of my

business... I'm going to move now,

okay...

(takes a step to one

side)

You guys want to fight, that's up to

you...

(takes another step)

I'm leaving now... I won't say a

word...

STAR MAN

Go.

JENNY

Could you put the gun down?

JENNY

Gun... Down... Down.

JENNY

Thank you.

SHERMIN

There's nothing... No reports of

sightings or landings or anything...

in the other parts of the country or

overseas... Seems like a totally

isolated incident.

MAJOR BELL

It was only an accident that we

discovered them.

SHERMIN

I know, but...

SHERMIN

You married, Major?

MAJOR BELL

Twenty-eight years.

SHERMIN

To the same woman?

MAJOR BELL

(smiling)

Yes.

SHERMIN

I tried it once... Fourteen years

ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a

worse father. The only thing I'm

good at is this... At least until

yesterday.

SHERMIN

How would you describe the sounds we

heard coming out of that thing's

helmet?

MAJOR BELL

(after trying to

imitate them)

It was kind of like clicking, maybe

a language wasn't it?

SHERMIN

Listen to this.

(paraphrasing the

telex)

A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire

this morning. When a citizen went to

her rescue the kidnapper threatened

him with a gun and shouted at him in

a strange 'clicking gibberish'...

MAJOR BELL

It was a man though... right?

SHERMIN

The police think he was high on

drugs...

SHERMIN

What do you think?

MAJOR BELL

(slides the last few

feet down the hill)

Nothing up there... The grass is

matted down in a few places, but

that could have been anything.

SHERMIN

It was the husband. The police finally

got a hold of the witness at work

and showed him a picture of the woman.

MAJOR BELL

It's the right area, that's for sure.

SHERMIN

Why the clicking language though?

SHERMIN

Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's

been some trouble next door. I'd

like to ask you a few questions.

MAN

What happened?

SHERMIN

There's a possibility that Mrs.

Haydn's been kidnapped. We're hoping

you might have seen something.

WOMAN

(to the Man)

I told you...

MAN

Judy, that's stupid.

WOMAN

Well, maybe these men won't think

so. We were asleep when a helicopter

woke me up. It made me so nervous I

went into the kitchen for something

to eat. I happened to look out the

window and there was Scott Haydn

with this green thing draped over

his arm pulling Jenny down the walk

to the car.

MAN

You know that's impossible!

WOMAN

I know what I saw. I've seen him

enough times.

MAN

(giving up on his

wife and addressing

Shermin and Lyman)

Scott Haydn is dead. He died about

three months ago. We went to the

funeral.

STAR MAN (V.O.)

R-r-S-s...

STAR MAN

T-t-U...

STAR MAN

u-V-v...

STAR MAN

(pointing correctly

to the various animals)

Cow... Dog... Pig...

STAR MAN

W-w...

STAR MAN

What?

JENNY

(knows what's coming)

X...

JENNY

What's so funny about X?

DISSOLVE TO:

SHERMIN (V.O.)

(his voice quavering)

George, we've just confirmed the

existence of the live

extraterrestrial.

FOX

(after a beat)

When can we expect containment?

SHERMIN (V.O.)

Well, we're in pursuit of a green

Mustang...

FOX

(very controlled)

It's in a green Mustang?

SHERMIN (V.O.)

Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at

gunpoint and from what we can make

out is forcing her to drive it

somewhere.

MILITARY MAN

(to the room)

This one has a weapon.

SHERMIN (V.O.)

No, no... A .45, it probably got it

in the woman's house. They were last

seen in downtown Eau Claire...

FOX

Why did you let it get into a

populated area?

SHERMIN (V.O.)

It's taken on a disguise.

FOX

Clarify that.

SHERMIN (V.O.)

It's made itself look like the woman's

dead husband.

FOX

Repeat the last item.

SHERMIN (V.O.)

The extraterrestrial now looks like

this.

FOX

(softly)

Oh shit!!!

STAR MAN (O.S.)

(reading slowly)

The United States of America. In God

We Trust. Ten dollars.

JENNY

Money.

STAR MAN

Money.

JENNY

Money.

STAR MAN

Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens...

Jennyhaydn... Money?

JENNY

(shaking her head

'no,' exhausted)

We're going to have to stop for gas

soon.

STAR MAN

What?

JENNY

Smile.

STAR MAN

Smile... good?

JENNY

Yes.

STAR MAN

(impressed)

What?!

JENNY

Minneapolis.

STAR MAN

(reaching into the

leg pouch he took

from his life-support

suit)

Minneapolis... Minneapolis...

JENNY

What are you doing?

JENNY

...What's that?

STAR MAN

Minneapolis... good.

JENNY

You're full of tricks, aren't you?

JENNY

(taps the fuel gauge)

We need gas.

JENNY

No gas.

STAR MAN

No gas.

JENNY

This car runs on gas.

JENNY

Gas...

JENNY

No gas.

JENNY

(V.O.)

Gas.

JENNY

(V.O.)

No gas.

JENNY

(V.O.)

Gas.

JENNY

(V.O.)

No gas.

JENNY

No gas... car dead.

(her head lolls forward

on her chest)

We need gas. I don't want to get

shot for running out of gas.

STAR MAN

Gas good?

JENNY

Yes. Very good.

JENNY

Gas...

STAR MAN

Go.

JENNY

It's closed... closed. We need one

that's open.

STAR MAN

Closed?

JENNY

You'll see.

STAR MAN

What?

JENNY

(snaps)

Not what. Who. What is for things.

(touching the steering

wheel, dashboard,

seat, gear shift)

What? What? What? What? For people

you use who. Who is he?

(points to the man in

the picture)

Who is she?

(points to the woman)

Who are you?

(points to the STAR

MAN)

Who am I?

STAR MAN

(mirrors her gestures)

Who is he? Who is she? Who are you?

Who am I?

(pause; it clicks for

him and he points at

Jenny)

Who are you?

JENNY

I am Jenny Haydn.

STAR MAN

(flips back to her

license and reads)

Jennyhaydn.

JENNY

Who are you?

STAR MAN

I am...

JENNY

That's a big help. Where are you

from?

STAR MAN

From?

JENNY

(leans forward and

points through the

windshield at the

sky)

Are you from up there? Space?

STAR MAN

(leans forward to

look with her)

Space?

JENNY

Up there... I... eh... can't

explain...

(leans back)

But that's the only place you could

be from.

STAR MAN

Gas.

JENNY

(shakes her head 'no')

Closed.

STAR MAN

No gas.

JENNY

I know.

STAR MAN

Who?

JENNY

My... husband.

STAR MAN

I am husband?

JENNY

No. I don't know what you are, but

you're not Scott.

JENNY

(brushes it away

angrily)

Shit.

STAR MAN

Shit?

JENNY

No, no... don't say that. Bad word.

STAR MAN

(likes the sound of

it)

Shit... shit... what shit?

JENNY

(screams)

Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse

than a parrot!!

JENNY

Mouth closed... closed.

JENNY

I see it.

STAR MAN

Who?

JENNY

Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put

the gun down. Under the seat. Under

the seat...

STAR MAN

No.

JENNY

Oh God! You're going to get us both

killed. Okay... in your pocket...

JENNY

In your pocket... pocket...

JENNY

In your pocket, please...

STAR MAN

(draws his fingers

over his lips)

You. Mouth closed.

JENNY

Okay.

ATTENDANT

Morning, folks. Fill her up?

STAR MAN

(overly loud)

...Gas...

ATTENDANT

You got it.

JENNY

I'm going to the ladies' room. You

stay here.

JENNY

(wheels on him as he

catches up)

Go back to the car.

JENNY

See. It's a bathroom. I'm not trying

to escape. I just have to go to the

bathroom.

JENNY

Satisfied? Now get out. Out.

STAR MAN

No.

JENNY

Women... me.

JENNY

Men. You go in here.

JENNY

Come on.

RIDER

Do I need a key for the head?

ATTENDANT

It's open.

RIDER

(over his shoulder)

Fill it up.

ATTENDANT

You got it.

JENNY

Just a minute.

RIDER

Howdy... can't get her out.

STAR MAN

(thru the smile)

Gas.

RIDER

I know how she feels.

JENNY

(stepping around him)

It's still a toilet. Hasn't become a

ballroom.

STAR MAN

Kid-nap-ped... go-ing W o-n...

JENNY

(on her way out)

That's very good.

STAR MAN

Money.

JENNY

Yes.

STAR MAN

What?

JENNY

Candy.

STAR MAN

(as it tumbles into

the bin)

Money... candy.

ATTENDANT

(to the STAR MAN)

That'll be fifteen fifty, sir.

JENNY

Here.

ATTENDANT

Thank you.

STAR MAN

(to himself)

Thank you.

STAR MAN

What is...

(reads off the can)

...Coke?

JENNY

A drink.

STAR MAN

(holds his hand out

for it)

I...

JENNY

You want to try it?

STAR MAN

I want to try it.

JENNY

This stuff could kill...

(changes her mind and

smiles)

Be my guest.

STAR MAN

(after a loud burp)

Good.

JENNY

Eh... you keep it. I've had enough.

JENNY

What's the matter?

STAR MAN

(throws the can to

the ground)

Shit!

STAR MAN

What is kidnapped?

STAR MAN

(yells)

Kidnapped!!!

STAR MAN

Kidnapped!!! What is kidnapped?!!

JENNY

Kidnapped is what you're doing to me

now!!! Kidnapped is pointing a gun

at me and taking me from my house!

Kidnapped is changing yourself into

my husband. I don't know what you

are and I don't care. I just want to

get away from you!

STAR MAN

Jennyhaydn.

STAR MAN

I am good.

(and he slides the

.45 under his seat)

STAR MAN

What is that?

JENNY

(finally)

Horses.

STAR MAN

(without looking at

her)

Horses.

STAR MAN

What?

JENNY

Music.

JENNY

(alarmed)

What are you doing?!

STAR MAN

(subtitles)

Iron channel message. Transmute was

successful. Have captured one of

them. It is taking me to the pick-up

point in a land vehicle.

(eyeing Jenny)

I think I can control it by mastering

its language, which is primitive and

easy to learn. Will arrive on time.

Wait for me.

FOX (V.O.)

I just came from a meeting with the

Security Council and

(the picture breaks

up, but the voice

continues)

in view of the extraterrestrial's

radical change and the fact that all

our efforts

(the picture re-

assembles)

to contact its ship remain unanswered,

it was decided to issue a ten state

'all points bulletin' for Scott Haydn,

Jenny Haydn and the green Mustang.

The officers have been instructed

not to approach the people or the

vehicle but to contact you. You will

then move in and contain the subjects.

SHERMIN

(sorting it out)

You sure you want this, because...

that's putting an awful lot of faith

in people we have no control over...

FOX (V.O.)

I'm afraid the situation demands

that kind of risk.

SHERMIN

I don't like it, George...

FOX (V.O.)

Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were

asking for help. What's changed?

SHERMIN

It's messy... the thing's got a gun...

We're just asking for somebody to

get killed...

FOX (V.O.)

We don't know what else to do. We

need results.

SHERMIN

(accepting)

You'll get results one way or the

other, that's for sure... Okay.

FOX (V.O.)

I'm gonna be here if you need

anything.

MAJOR BELL

They're gonna let some local cop

blow him away.

LYMAN

Save us all a lot of trouble.

MAJOR BELL

Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.

LYMAN

Bullshit!

MAJOR BELL

You have no conception of this, do

you?

LYMAN

You jerk! You look at all the

sweetness and light and goodness you

think'll come out of this. You know

what's gonna come out of this... The

end of religion, the end of

civilization, the end of the earth.

We could become slaves, we could

become a colony of these things.

Don't you see that? Are you too stupid

to see that?

SHERMIN

Are you ladies through?...

SHERMIN

Good... It looks like we might be

the welcoming committee, so I think

we should try and figure out what

we're gonna do if we have to come

face to face with this creature.

LYMAN

Bell wants us to get down on our

knees and bow.

SHERMIN

(to Bell)

Did your people have any contingencies

rehearsed?

MAJOR BELL

No... I guess we never thought it

would happen.

SHERMIN

Terrific.

JENNY

(loud)

Red light!

JENNY

(screams)

Stop!!!

JENNY

That was a red light!! I told you

you have to stop at a red light!!

STAR MAN

(sheepish)

It was yellow.

JENNY

You didn't even see it.

STAR MAN

I will see it next time.

JENNY

You better.

JENNY

(indicating the red

dot on the satel

compass)

Why are you going here? What is here?

STAR MAN

My...

(searches for word)

...car will take me...

(pokes finger toward

sky)

...up there... home.

JENNY

(at the red dot again)

When do you have to be here?

STAR MAN

I do not understand.

JENNY

(rubs her temples and

laments to herself)

How will I do this one?...

JENNY

(pointing to the sun)

Sun...

STAR MAN

Yes.

JENNY

Sun... day. No sun... night. You

understand?

STAR MAN

Yes. Day... night.

JENNY

How many days and nights do you have

to go...

(prods the red dot)

...here?

STAR MAN

Three nights... two days.

JENNY

That's not much time. I'll just slow

you down. I have to sleep. I'm very

tired. And I have to wash and eat.

You don't...

STAR MAN

I need you.

JENNY

I won't tell anybody if that's what

you're worried about. I promise.

You'll keep...

STAR MAN

No.

JENNY

You'll keep the car. I'll take a

bus...

(an awful possibility

occurs to her)

Am I going up there with you... in

your ship... up there?

STAR MAN

No.

JENNY

Then let me go. You don't need me.

STAR MAN

No.

JENNY

I feel like I'm going crazy here.

You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't

know what's real anymore. I can't be

here with you.

JENNY

Do you understand what I'm saying to

you? You can keep the car.

(she hands him some

money)

That should be enough for gas from

here to there. Please let me go.

STAR MAN

(taps the red dot on

the satel compass)

When we get here.

JENNY

You bastard.

STAR MAN

Jennyhaydn!

YOUNG MAN

Hey!!

MOTHER

My baby!!! He's stealing my baby!

Burt!!

MOTHER

Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was

stealing my baby!!

MAN

Where you think you're going?

STAR MAN

Please.

MOTHER

He was trying to steal Gloria.

BURT

Is that right? Huh?

STAR MAN

(stutters)

Please.

BURT

Is that right? Come on. Answer me.

BURT

Were you trying to steal my baby?

Huh? Answer me!

STAR MAN

Jennyhaydn!

STAR MAN

Jennyhaydn!

JENNY (O.S.)

Stop it!!! Stop it!!!

JENNY

Get away from him!! Leave him alone!!

You stupid jerks!! He's retarded!!

Can't you see that?!! Get away from

him!!

MOTHER

He was stealing my baby...

JENNY

You're wrong!! He would never do

anything like that!!

(takes STAR MAN's

hand)

Let's go...

MOTHER

He had Gloria in his hands!

JENNY

He's retarded! I shouldn't have left

him alone!

JENNY

(hisses)

Get out of my way.

JENNY

Are you okay?

STAR MAN

(as Jenny puts him in

the passenger seat)

Thank you.

CLERK

(handing it to her)

Gate three. It's boarding now.

JENNY

Thank you.

CLERK

Have a nice trip.

JENNY

The closest I was able to get you

was Lathrop Wells...

STAR MAN

(pointing to baby)

Is that a baby?

JENNY

Yes.

STAR MAN

A baby is a new person?

JENNY

Eh... yes...

STAR MAN

Do you have a baby?

JENNY

No... The closest...

STAR MAN

Why?

JENNY

I'd love to have a baby. But I

can't...

STAR MAN

Why?

JENNY

I can't... Forget the baby. Okay?

The closest I was able to get you

was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to

hitchhike the rest of the way.

STAR MAN

But I must go here.

JENNY

I know that. But the buses don't go

there.

STAR MAN

(suspicious)

What is hitchhike?

JENNY

That's easy. I'll explain that in a

minute. This is your ticket. When

you get on the bus here, the driver

will take this part. You will ride

to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask

the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please.

I do not speak English.'

JENNY

Say it.

STAR MAN

'Salt Lake City, please. I do not

speak English.'

JENNY

The driver will...

STAR MAN

But I speak English.

JENNY

Will you please do it my way? You'll

get into trouble if you don't. If

anybody talks to you, tell them... I

do not speak English.

STAR MAN

(indignant)

I do not speak English.

JENNY

Right. In Omaha the driver will put

you on the bus for Salt Lake City

and the new driver will take...

(bends back second

portion of ticket)

...this part. When you get to Salt

Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas,

please'...

STAR MAN

(impatient)

'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak

English.' What is hitchhike?

JENNY

You want this ticket?

STAR MAN

Yes.

JENNY

Then don't be smart.

P.A. SYSTEM (V.O.)

Last call for bus 33 to Vermillion,

Sioux City and Omaha... loading at

Gate 3.

JENNY

That's your bus.

(picks up the map and

folds it)

When you get to Las Vegas, ask the

driver. 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do

not speak English.'

STAR MAN

(falling into step

next to her)

'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not

speak English.'

JENNY

(hands him the map)

You keep this. Now this is hitch-

hike...

(stops in the middle

of the waiting area

to illustrate)

You stand on the side of the road,

the highway... you understand? And

you face the cars going in the

direction you want to go. When you

see a car or a truck coming, you

stick out your thumb like this...

JENNY

Your thumb tells the driver that you

want a ride.

STAR MAN

The car will stop?

JENNY

(continuing toward

the loading platform)

Not every car, but... a car will

stop... Maybe not the first car...

maybe number eight, number fifteen...

STAR MAN

When do I get to Lathrop Wells?

JENNY

Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking

right away and...

JENNY

...you'll have plenty of time to get

to where you want to go.

JENNY

Don't worry. They're not going to

hurt you. Come on.

(gives him ticket)

Only show this to the driver. Nobody

else. And don't lose it.

STAR MAN

Can I have the gun?

JENNY

No.

JENNY

You might need this.

JENNY

Don't be afraid. Do what I told you

and you'll be okay.

STAR MAN

(nervous)

Yes.

JENNY

Well... I'm going to go now.

STAR MAN

Go?

JENNY

Yes. I have a long ride ahead of

me...

(takes his hand)

Goodbye.

STAR MAN

Goodbye.

STAR MAN

Jennyhaydn.

JENNY

Yes?

STAR MAN

Please stay.

JENNY

I'll stay till you get on the bus.

DRIVER

Ticket?

JENNY

See? You're going to be okay.

JENNY

Goodbye.

STAR MAN

(touches his cheek)

What?

JENNY

It's a kiss...

(she motions for him

to get on the bus)

Goodbye...

DRIVER

Let's go.

JENNY

(softly)

Oh no...

JENNY

What happened?

STAR MAN

I was afraid.

JENNY

Okay, you win. Get in.

SHOPKEEPER

This kind of thing's real bad for

business...

TOUGH

He couldn't even speak English.

MOTHER

Those kind of people should be shot.

ONLOOKER

What happened?

WAITRESS

I think he was just lost...

BURT

Who's side are you on?

TOUGH

No way he was going to get away from

me.

LYMAN

Where's that?... And it was one

person, one way...

SECURITY GUARD

Eyewitnesses are the worst. You get

two of them together. You got three

stories. You know what I mean?

SECURITY GUARD

Is there a reward in this?

SHERMIN

Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't

SECURITY GUARD

Because I'm the one who called the

police, you know.

SHERMIN

Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.

SECURITY GUARD

Hey, it's none of my business why

you're chasing a retard... You want

my opinion, it's the girl. She had

to hold the guy's hand all the way

to the car like he was a kid.

SHERMIN

You saw that?

SECURITY GUARD

Hey... he didn't look like no big

time criminal to me.

SECURITY GUARD

Eh... the store tells you to call

when there's trouble, so they won't

get sued... But that shouldn't matter

if there's a reward, right?

SHERMIN

I wouldn't think so.

SECURITY GUARD

(peeling off)

That's what I thought. So remember

it was me because sometimes rewards

come late, you know.

SHERMIN

We will.

(he turns to Lyman)

Something's wrong here. She's helping

him now.

LYMAN

(alarmed)

I know. She bought him a ticket for

Lathrop Wells and put him on the

bus. He didn't stay on though and

they drove off together.

SHERMIN

(shaking his head)

Doesn't make sense.

LYMAN

Maybe he's turned her into one of

them. They enter the crowd around

the helicopter.

JENNY (V.O.)

Why did your ship land on this

planet... on Earth?

STAR MAN (V.O.)

It was a mistake.

JENNY

You thought we were a different

planet?!

STAR MAN

No. My ship was doing a map of all

the suns and...

JENNY

Stars... When a sun is far away, we

call it a 'star.'

STAR MAN

We were doing a map of the stars and

all the other things up there when

we saw a small ship. My... eh... we

kidnapped it. On it there was a map

that said how to come to Earth. This

was very important. Before then, we

thought we were the only people in

all the stars.

JENNY

You did? That's funny. So did we.

STAR MAN

Yes?

JENNY

Yes.

STAR MAN

We told our home, and the people who

tell us what to do on my planet said

to come and look but not to talk,

not to land, not to shoot. Just to

look from up there. We came and...

the driver of my ship...

JENNY

The captain...

STAR MAN

The captain wanted to land to see

close and to get some things from

Earth to take home. The police came

and shot at us. One of the people

from my ship was killed.

JENNY

Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was

he a good friend?

STAR MAN

I don't understand 'friend.'

JENNY

A friend is a person that is good to

you... someone you like to be with...

someone you like to laugh with...

STAR MAN

He was a good friend... The captain

took the ship away fast and I was

not in the ship.

JENNY

The police shouldn't have started

shooting. But you can hardly blame

them. You surprised them. They didn't

know you were up there. When they

saw you, they thought you were here

to hurt us.

STAR MAN

I understand.

JENNY

Sounds like your captain's going to

get hell when he gets back home.

STAR MAN

What is hell?

JENNY

It's bad.

STAR MAN

He will.

JENNY

What are you doing?

STAR MAN

Are you my friend?

JENNY

Yes.

STAR MAN

(smiles)

I am your friend.

PREACHER (V.O.)

(on radio)

God is your creator. God is your

master. God is you savior. God is

the only reason that you exist. If

God...

STAR MAN

(during the above)

Who is God?

JENNY

Nobody knows.

STAR MAN

Why?

JENNY

I don't know.

STAR MAN

I like this music.

JENNY

I've noticed... Do you understand

what they're saying?

STAR MAN

Not all... but it feels like a kiss.

JENNY

Do you have music up there?

STAR MAN

Yes.

JENNY

I'd like to hear it. Can you sing

something?

STAR MAN

I do not want to.

JENNY

Don't be afraid... I'd really like

to hear it.

JENNY

Please.

STAR MAN

I am not a good singer.

JENNY

That was beautiful.

STAR MAN

(incredulous)

You liked my singing?

JENNY

Yes. Sing some more.

CLERK

What can I do for you folks?

JENNY

How much are your rooms?

CLERK

Thirty-seven fifty for one person,

forty-nine fifty for two.

JENNY

You have one with two beds?

CLERK

Sure.

JENNY

I'll take that.

CLERK

(slides her a

registration card)

Fill this out.

(as Jenny writes)

Will this be cash or credit card?

JENNY

Credit card.

CLERK

I'll have to run your card off now.

JENNY

(digging through her

purse)

We're only going to be here a few

hours...

CLERK

It's still the full price.

STAR MAN

Jenny, look...

JENNY

Put that back.

STAR MAN

But I have never seen this before. I

am not complete.

JENNY

Put it back.

CLERK

You can park your car in front of

the room.

DRIVER

(into microphone of

his radio)

What did these two do?

SECOND DRIVER

All anybody knows is that they're

armed and dangerous.

SECOND OFFICER

Be a piece of cake for us to take

'em.

THIRD DRIVER

National Security folks should be

here any minute. Let them take care

of it. That's what they get the big

bucks for.

STAR MAN

I want a drink. May I have two

quarters?

JENNY

(handing it to him)

You shouldn't drink so much of that

stuff. It's bad for you.

STAR MAN

On the radio they say it's good.

JENNY

Hurry up.

STAR MAN

(coming to the car

with a drink can in

each hand)

The machine gave me two. Should I

put one back?

JENNY

No. Get in.

STAR MAN

(rounding the hood)

You can have one.

JENNY

(as he gets in)

I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive

for a little while longer.

STAR MAN

Are you angry at me?

JENNY

No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.

SECOND DRIVER

(as the Mustang rolls

onto the frontage

road)

They made us. Let's get 'em.

JENNY

No.

JENNY

No!!! No!!!

DRIVER

He's got a gun!!

STAR MAN

Jennyhaydn! Jennyhaydn!!

LYMAN

(seeing the blood on

the passenger seat)

One of them must be pretty badly

hurt.

SHERMIN

(to Bell, indicating

the suit)

Get this back to the copter.

SHERMIN

(bullhorn to woods)

Mrs. Haydn, please come out. We don't

want to hurt you or your friend.

Please put down your weapon and come

out.

SHERMIN

Okay, fan out. These people have a

gun but we want them alive.

Understand?

THIRD DRIVER

Over here! They're over here!

STAR MAN

(strokes her cheek)

You will be all right.

SHERMIN

Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt

you. Put down your gun and come out.

We just want to talk to your friend.

STAR MAN

(subtitles)

Iron channel message. Almost caught

by pursuers. This may hinder escape.

Wait for me.

DISSOLVE TO:

WOMAN

Don't forget to tell the boys where

you had a good time.

DRIVER

(calling back to her)

You weren't that good.

SHERMIN

Tell him I'm not here.

LYMAN

I did.

SHERMIN

Get me a radio. At least I won't

have to look at his face.

FOX (V.O.)

We're growing very concerned back

here. There's no use pretending

otherwise. We're rapidly approaching

a 'condition red.' People are

beginning to ask difficult questions.

SHERMIN

I'll make this as simple as I can,

George. They disappeared.

FOX (V.O.)

I don't care where you're from you

just can't disappear into thin air.

SHERMIN

(through a punchy

hysterical laugh)

George, listen to what you're saying.

This thing's changed itself into a

man. Disappearing may not be that

big a deal.

FOX (V.O.)

So far you've let it cross the heart

of America. For two days it has been

absorbing information that is

detrimental to our security. I don't

see the humor in that.

SHERMIN

Maybe... look, this is just something

to think about... from what I got at

the shopping center, it was more

scared than anything else... I don't

feel it's as big a threat as you

think it is...

FOX (V.O.)

Is that what's affecting your

performance?

SHERMIN

I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm

doing my damndest to catch them.

Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on

70 past Grand Junction. They're

heading west. If they're not flying

we have a damn good chance of getting

them. All I'm asking is that you

people think about it.

FOX (V.O.)

You just do your job, Shermin. We'll

make the policy.

JENNY

Hello... hello.

JENNY

Hello. Where are you?

STAR MAN (V.O.)

Jennyhay...

STAR MAN (V.O.)

...nd. You are all fixed. I'm sorry

you were shot. I was a big problem

for you. Thank you for your help. I

can go to my ship alone now.

JENNY

Where did you stop last?

DRIVER

What the hell do you think you're

doing?

JENNY

Where did you stop last?

DRIVER

Stay right there...

JENNY

What was your last stop?

DRIVER

Elmo's...

JENNY

Where's that?

DRIVER

About five miles back.

DRIVER

(shouting after her)

Are there any more in there?

MAN

Where are you going?

STAR MAN

Las Vegas, please. I do not speak

English.

MAN

Hop in.

MAN

(re-entering the flow

of traffic)

I can only take you to Grand Junction,

but you'll have a better chance to

get a ride from there.

MAN

Where you from?

STAR MAN

I don't understand.

MAN

Parlez vous Francais?... Habla

Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?

MAN

Good job, neither do I. What do you

do for a living?

STAR MAN

(pretending)

I don't understand.

MAN

I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'

STAR MAN

No.

COOK (MAN)

Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as

a cook. That's how I make money.

STAR MAN

I understand.

COOK

What do you do?

STAR MAN

(searches for an

answer, then)

I make maps.

COOK

Hey, that sounds interesting. You

like it?

STAR MAN

Eh... yes.

COOK

Make any money?

STAR MAN

No.

COOK

(takes a pack of Camels

out of his pocket)

You don't get rich as a cook, either,

believe me. I got a girl going to

college this fall. The wife had to

go back to nursing to help pay for

it.

COOK

Smoke?

COOK

She wants to become a doctor. She's

a bright kid. Hard worker. I think

she'll make it. But the damned

inflation's driven the tuition up so

high it makes it real tough on a

family like ours.

COOK

I got two other kids. I don't know

what we'll do when they get old enough

for college.

COOK

Everybody blames it on the oil crisis.

That might be where it starts. But I

think a lot of people are just using

that as an excuse to rip the rest of

us off. I see it every day in the

kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon

cans. The price has gone up three

times in the last year. And now the

cans are only half full.

COOK

Do you have children?

STAR MAN

No.

COOK

They're damned expensive and a pain

in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't

trade having them for anything.

COOK

What do you think of America?

STAR MAN

It is beautiful.

JENNY (O.S.)

I'm looking for a guy about this

tall, with brown hair and really

gray eyes...

JENNY

He had on tan cords, a plaid shirt

and a baseball cap... probably

hitchhiking.

ATTENDANT

I don't pay much attention to those

guys.

JENNY

(taking out her wallet)

In the last hour or so...

ATTENDANT

Nope.

JENNY

This is him.

ATTENDANT

(shakes his head)

Sorry.

SECOND ATTENDANT

(looking at picture)

I don't know... I'm not sure. I might

have seen him up the road a piece on

my way in. He's long gone by now.

JENNY

You know if anybody here's going to

Wisconsin?

SECOND ATTENDANT

Ask inside.

JENNY

(small voice)

Anybody going to...

JENNY

Anybody going to Wisconsin?

JENNY

I need a ride.

OLDER MAN

I'm going to Des Moines. If you can

wait till I finish here, you're

welcome to ride along.

JENNY

I can wait.

JENNY

(to the waitress)

Where's the phone?

OPERATOR (V.O.)

Operator... may I help you?

JENNY

Could you give me the highway patrol,

please?

MALE (V.O.)

Sergeant Packert, Highway Patrol.

JENNY

My name's Jenny Haydn. I think you're

looking for me. I was kidnapped in

Eau Claire, Wisconsin a couple of

days ago. But I'm free now.

SERGEANT (V.O.)

What was your name again?

JENNY

Jenny Haydn. I'm on my way home and

I don't want anybody I'm with shot

at when you...

SERGEANT (V.O.)

Hold on.

SHERMIN

(hand over the mouth-

piece)

You trace it yet?

TECHNICIAN

All we know right now is that it's

east of here.

SHERMIN

This is Marc Shermin. Where are you,

Mrs. Haydn?

JENNY

I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's.

Look, I just wanted to tell you that

I'm all right and I'm on my way home.

SHERMIN (V.O.)

You've been through quite an ordeal,

Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where

you are and let us pick you up? We'll

fly you home.

JENNY

No. You'll want to ask a lot of

questions I don't want to answer

right now. I already have a ride.

JENNY (V.O.)

I only called to tell you I was free

and not to shoot anybody I was with

if you see me.

SHERMIN

Is the man who kidnapped you there

now?

JENNY (V.O.)

I told you. He let me go. I'm on my

way home.

SHERMIN

(his hand over the

mouthpiece)

Get a highway patrol unit over there.

SHERMIN (V.O.)

Mrs. Haydn, I'm going to have to ask

you to stay where you are.

OLDER MAN

Ready?

JENNY

(into phone)

Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name

again?

SHERMIN (V.O.)

Marc Shermin.

JENNY

Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If

you want to ask me any questions,

call me at home in a couple of days.

I'm in the book.

SHERMIN (V.O.)

Do you know what you were kidnapped

by?

SHERMIN (V.O.)

Mrs. Haydn...

JENNY

He doesn't want to hurt anybody.

Please leave him alone.

SHERMIN (V.O.)

Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?

SHERMIN (V.O.)

What's he planning to do in Lathrop

Wells? Is he meeting someone there?

JENNY

(on her way past the

weathered driver)

I changed my mind. Thanks.

JENNY

(at the top of her

lungs)

It's me again...

JENNY

I need a fast ride west.

JENNY

You sure this is your car?

TEENAGER

(with a stutter)

My grandmother's rich.

JENNY

(as they come up on a

station wagon)

Slow down, slow down.

TEENAGER

Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.

JENNY

(peering at its

occupants)

I told you I'm looking for someone.

TEENAGER

In the cars, too?!

JENNY

I don't know where he is.

TEENAGER

This is going to be a real drag. I

thought you wanted to go fast.

TEENAGER

They after you?

JENNY

What? No, of course not.

TEENAGER

(his stutter thicker

than before)

Would be kinda neat if they were. I

think I could outrun them. Maybe get

my picture in the papers.

COOK

Well, here we are... You go down

that ramp there, you're sure to get

a ride.

STAR MAN

(getting out)

Thank you.

COOK

And don't be shy about your English.

You speak better than a lot of people

I know.

(leaving)

Take care of yourself.

VOICES (V.O.)

Flash for all you good buddies heading

west on 70. Smoky's got a roadblock

just beyond Grand Junction... Better

dump your dope, they're going through

everything... He's right. I was just

there and I'm still sore...

VOICES (V.O.)

Ah loves to be frisked! What are

they looking for? I'm holding. Any

way around it? Where are you? Oh

no!! There it is!!

TEENAGER

I bet you we find your friend at the

roadblock.

JENNY

(to the road ahead)

We better find him before that.

PATROLMAN

The girl's not here, Mr. Shermin.

Seems right after she talked to you,

she got a ride west with a kid.

SHERMIN

(into mouthpiece of

his headset)

You get that, Lyman?

LYMAN (V.O.)

We're ready.

LONG HAIR

Where you going?

STAR MAN

Las Vegas, please.

LONG HAIR

We're going to L.A.

LONG HAIR

Sure. Get in. We can drop you in

Vegas or get you darn close.

TEENAGER

I'm telling you, you're going to

find him at the roadblock, or right

after, or not at all.

JENNY

If he didn't want to go through the

roadblock, is there any other way to

get to Vegas?

TEENAGER

Fly.

TEENAGER

The five-fifty. We already passed

it. But it'll take him way out of

his way.

JENNY

Pull over. I've got to get back there.

TEENAGER

Why wouldn't he want to go through

the roadblock?... What did you guys

do?... I won't tell anybody.

JENNY

It's easier not to tell if you don't

know.

TEENAGER

(as Jenny opens the

door)

Wait. Could I have your autograph?

JENNY

Sure.

TEENAGER

I have nothing to do. I'd like to

help you.

JENNY

Don't worry. I'll be all right.

STAR MAN

JENNYHAYDN!!!

STAR MAN

I told you goodbye. Why are you here?

JENNY

The police are waiting for you up

ahead. There's a roadblock. You have

to go back.

STAR MAN

This car will take me to Las Vegas.

I cannot go back.

JENNY

The police know about Lathrop Wells.

We have to go another way. Come on.

STAR MAN

If I don't meet the ship, my people

will go home without me.

JENNY

Please understand. If you go this

way, you'll never get to your ship.

The police know about Lathrop Wells.

We have to go another way. I'll get

you to your ship. I promise.

STAR MAN

I will go. But not you.

JENNY

You shit! I'll decide if I go or

not. Not you. I don't know what you

do on your planet, but I didn't think

that was very nice walking out on me

like you did.

STAR MAN

I don't want you to be hurt.

JENNY

Come on.

JENNY

I didn't ask to come along on this

trip, but I sure as hell am going to

be the one to say when I get off.

SHERMIN

(into headset)

Any sign of either of them yet?

LYMAN

I don't think they're going to show.

SHERMIN

Okay. Tell the highway patrol to

block all major arteries off 70 from

here to Elmo's.

STAR MAN

The Cook said I speak good English.

DISSOLVE TO:

JENNY

Where are you going?

STAR MAN

I must meet my ship.

JENNY

Why can't we wait here for a ride?

STAR MAN

I feel better if I move.

JENNY

We're hundreds of miles from where

you have to be.

JENNY

(shouts at him)

Even if we walk five miles, it's not

going to make any difference.

STAR MAN

(screams after it)

Asshole!!

JENNY

(shocked)

Where did you learn that?

STAR MAN

The cook.

JENNY

(after a few steps)

We're not going to get a ride tonight.

STAR MAN

I can't stay on this planet.

JENNY

No one's traveling in this weather.

STAR MAN

You promised you would get me to my

ship.

JENNY

(shouts after him)

I will. I will. We still have another

day.

STAR MAN

You promised.

JENNY

What do you want from me? There are

no cars on this road. I didn't ask

for this stupid storm.

JENNY

What are you saying?

STAR MAN

You can stop. I will go on alone.

JENNY

We're too far away to walk. Don't

you understand?

STAR MAN

I can't stay here. I want to go home.

I don't want this skin. I don't want

to look like this.

JENNY

(trying to ease his

pain)

Why don't you send one of your radio

balloons and tell your captain that

you might be late?

STAR MAN

I used the last one to jump off the

cliff...

JENNY

Let's find a place out of the rain.

I'm sure we'll get a ride in the

morning.

STAR MAN

I can't be late. I don't know if the

radio balloons work above your planet.

I don't know if my words went to the

ship. If I'm not there, the captain

will think I'm dead and go.

JENNY

We'll get a ride in the morning.

JENNY

Can you close the door?

STAR MAN

You are cold.

JENNY

You're damn right I am.

STAR MAN

I do not get cold.

JENNY

(crossing to him)

Open your shirt.

JENNY

(savoring it)

Oh, you're warm... put your arms

around me.

JENNY

Take your shirt off.

STAR MAN

What?

JENNY

Nothing.

JENNY

Good morning.

STAR MAN

Horses.

JENNY

You don't forget anything, do you?

STAR MAN

No.

JENNY

(to the horse)

Hello... hello. How are you this

morning?

STAR MAN

Do they talk?!

JENNY

(laughs)

No, they don't talk... We talk to

them.

STAR MAN

I understand.

JENNY

Oh, you're pretty...

STAR MAN

I gave you a baby last night.

STAR MAN

(meaning the horses)

They are beautiful.

JENNY

Yes, they are.

STAR MAN

You have been very good to me,

Jennyhaydn.

(turns to face her)

You said you wanted a baby, so I

gave you one.

JENNY

(shakes her head 'no')

But...

STAR MAN

It will be human and it will look

like this.

(touches his face)

But when it comes it will know

everything I know and everything you

know. That is something from my planet

that I want your baby to have.

JENNY

I told you it's impossible for me to

have a baby.

STAR MAN

You will have this baby. If you want

it. If you don't, I can stop it now.

JENNY

I want it.

SHERMIN

Hello George.

FOX

Shermin...

SHERMIN

What's all this for?

FOX

We have a new directive. I'm taking

over.

SHERMIN

(scans the Cobras)

We don't have to do it that way. We

can catch him this time.

FOX

Washington thinks it's too late for

that.

SHERMIN

I've never been taken off an

assignment in my life. Give me twenty-

four hours and I'll have him for

you.

FOX

You're not hearing me.

SHERMIN

You can change a directive, George.

You've done it before. Listen to me.

He's going somewhere in Death Valley.

Lathrop Wells was never anything but

a bus stop. East is the nuclear site.

There are no roads in there. She was

teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling

you. We block the four roads into

Death Valley and we got him.

FOX

We'll do that. But how are we going

to hold him? He can change himself

into a man. He can disappear.

SHERMIN

That's the chance we have to take.

FOX

No, we don't.

SHERMIN

Then you're going to have to do it

without me.

FOX

You're a career intelligence officer,

Shermin. You'll be in the air with

us.

SHERMIN

You're talking about taking a life.

The most unique life form on this

planet. I think we're better than

that.

STAR MAN

Is this gambling?

STAR MAN

The cowboys were right. You can make

money fast gambling.

JENNY

You don't make money gambling. You

lose it.

JENNY (V.O.)

(to the clerk)

Do you have a good map of Death

Valley?

CLERK (V.O.)

We should have. Let me see.

STAR MAN

May I have twenty-five cents, please?

JENNY

What for?

STAR MAN

I want to gamble.

JENNY

Here are two quarters. When you lose

these, you're not going to get

anymore.

STAR MAN

I understand.

(heading back to the

machine)

Thank you.

JENNY

This is crazy. We don't have time

for this.

STAR MAN

I know how to gamble now.

JENNY

You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we

don't get a good ride before dark we

could miss your ship.

STAR MAN

I want to get money for you and the

baby.

JENNY

I don't need any money for the baby.

I'll be fine.

STAR MAN

Inflation, tuition, college. Children

are damned expensive. I know.

JENNY

The cook again?

STAR MAN

(stepping up to the

'Super Jackpot')

Yes.

JENNY

If I ever run into that guy, I'm

going to kick his ass.

JENNY

It'll tell you pretty much everything

about us...

STAR MAN

This is very interesting. We are

born knowing our history. We have

other books. But not a book like

this.

JENNY

Any words you don't know you can

find in the dictionary.

STAR MAN

I understand.

JENNY

It'll give you the different

countries, how they came to be, what

they are now, how America came to

be, the governments, the languages...

everything.

STAR MAN

(chuckles)

Many of my people will not believe

those things are possible. On my

planet there is only one government,

one people, one language. I will be

asked a lot of questions.

JENNY

What will you say about us?

STAR MAN

I will say that we can be friends.

JENNY

We can.

JENNY

This is yours...

STAR MAN

If you want to keep it, you can.

JENNY

I'd like to...

JENNY

(takes the ring off

again)

Would you put some of your singing

in this for the baby?

STAR MAN

You want the baby to laugh at me.

JENNY

Yes.

DISSOLVE TO:

JENNY

How long will it take you to get

home?

STAR MAN

(absently)

Many, many days and nights...

JENNY

Would you like to listen to some

music?

JENNY

I'm sure we could find a country and

western station.

STAR MAN

No, thank you.

JENNY

Don't worry. Everything's going to

be fine.

JENNY

(leans forward to

look up at night sky)

Which star is yours?

STAR MAN

There.

JENNY

Where?

STAR MAN

(meaning the star

Capella)

The yellow one.

JENNY

Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When

the baby is born, we'll go out in my

back yard and wave to you.

STAR MAN

(smiles)

I will wave to you.

STAR MAN

Oh, shit!

JENNY

(to the STAR MAN)

They're trying to get him.

JENNY

What are you doing?!!

FOX (V.O.)

Mrs. Haydn...

FOX

(speaking into a

headset)

This is George Fox...

JENNY (V.O.)

I want to speak to Marc Shermin.

FOX

You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm

in charge of this operation now.

JENNY

If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm

hanging up.

FOX (V.O.)

(a beat)

Okay...

JENNY

Mr. Shermin wants to speak to you.

JENNY (V.O.)

Here he is.

SHERMIN

Hello...

STAR MAN (V.O.)

I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.

SHERMIN

We can't let you do that.

STAR MAN (V.O.)

I don't want to hurt anybody. I just

want to go home.

SHERMIN (V.O.)

All the roads into Death Valley are

blocked. We'd like to talk to you.

STAR MAN (V.O.)

If I talk to you, I will miss my

ship.

SHERMIN (V.O.)

Hold on a minute... Let's take the

chance, George.

FOX

No deal.

SHERMIN (V.O.)

I'm afraid we can't let you go.

STAR MAN

I understand.

JENNY

Where do you think you're going?

STAR MAN

Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good.

I must go alone now.

JENNY

I said I would get you to your ship

and that's where we're going to say

goodbye.

JENNY

(glancing at the

modified drill)

I hope that works.

JENNY

It works.

STAR MAN

I do not know how many times I can

do this.

STAR MAN

If my ship is not here, we are in

trouble.

STAR MAN

(points at a

distinctive cone

peak)

That's where we landed last time.

Right under that mountain.

JENNY

In front!!! In front!!!

JENNY

Hang on.

FOX

(spots the car)

Over there.

STAR MAN

(gasps)

I can't shoot anymore.

JENNY

(touches his shoulder

lightly)

I won't let anyone hurt you.

FOX

Watch it. They're coming out.

FOX (V.O.)

End it, Shermin.

SHERMIN

George... Do you hear me, George?

FOX (V.O.)

What?

SHERMIN

I just retired.

FOX (V.O.)

Shermin!! Shermin!!!

SHERMIN

(to his crew)

Let's get out of here.

FOX

Shermin!!!

FOX

(to the pilot)

Lock in.

JENNY

Well...

STAR MAN

I must go.

STAR MAN

What do I do now?

JENNY

You say you love me and kiss me

'goodbye.'

STAR MAN

I love you.

JENNY

(her head on his

shoulder)

I'm never going to see you again, am

I?

STAR MAN

No.

JENNY

I love you.

STAR MAN

Tell the baby about me.

JENNY

I will.

STAR MAN

Goodbye.

JENNY

Wait!!

STAR MAN

Thank you, Jennyhaydn.

FADE OUT:

THE END
