BRIGITTE

You didn't wake me.

MICHAEL

You were sleeping.

BRIGITTE

You let me sleep because you can't

bear to have breakfast with me.

MICHAEL

Nothing could be further from the

truth. I boiled you an egg. See?

MICHAEL

I'd hardly have boiled you an egg

if I didn't want to see you. Tea or

coffee?

BRIGITTE

Does any woman ever stay long

enough to find out what the hell

goes on in your head?

BRIGITTE

What are you doing tonight?

2.

MICHAEL

I'm seeing my daughter.

BRIGITTE

Your daughter? You've kept very

quiet about her.

MICHAEL

Have I? She's been abroad for a

year. Did you say tea?

BRIGITTE

I'm going. Give my love to your

daughter.

3.

HANNA

Hey. Hey!

HANNA

Hey, kid. Hey.

MICHAEL

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

HANNA

Where do you live?

MICHAEL

It's here. I'll be fine now. Thank

you.

HANNA

Look after yourself.

4.

CARLA

I'm worried about him. He looks

terrible.

PETER

The boy's saying he doesn't need a

doctor.

EMILY

He does.

MICHAEL

I don't need a doctor.

PETER

Good then.

CARLA

Peter.

PETER

We're not going to argue about

this. People have to take

responsibility for their own lives.

DOCTOR

Remind me, how old are you now?

CARLA

Michael's fifteen.

DOCTOR

It's scarlet fever. He'll be in bed

for several months. At least.

CARLA

Keep away. He's contagious.

5.

DOCTOR

Burn the sheets. Complete

isolation. And three months is the

minimum.

CARLA

How are you feeling?

MICHAEL

Better. By the way, I meant to tell

you, the day I got ill... a woman

helped me. A woman in the street.

CARLA

She helped you?

MICHAEL

Yes. She brought me home.

CARLA

Do you have her address?

HANNA

Come in.

6.

MICHAEL

I brought you these flowers. To say

thank you.

HANNA

Put them down there.

MICHAEL

I would have come earlier, but I've

been in bed for three months.

HANNA

You're better now?

MICHAEL

Thank you.

HANNA

Have you always been weak?

MICHAEL

Oh no. I'd never been ill before.

It's incredibly boring. There's

nothing to do. I couldn't even be

bothered to read.

HANNA

I have to go to work. I'll walk

with you. Wait in the hall while I

change.

7.

8.

HANNA

There are two more buckets

downstairs. You can fill them and

bring them up.

HANNA

You look ridiculous, look at you,

kid.

HANNA

You can't go home like that. Give

me your clothes, I'll run you a

bath.

HANNA

What, do you always take a bath in

your trousers?

HANNA

It's all right, I won't look.

9.

HANNA

Wash your hair, I'll get you a

towel.

HANNA

So. That's why you came back.

MICHAEL

You're so incredibly beautiful.

HANNA

Now, kid, you know that's not true.

PETER

You've inconvenienced your mother.

MICHAEL

How many more times? I've said I'm

sorry.

PETER

You scared her.

MICHAEL

It's hardly my fault, I got lost,

that's all. That's why I was late.

Can I have some more?

10.

EMILY

How can anyone get lost in their

own home town?

MICHAEL

The doctor told me I had to take

walks.

EMILY

So?

MICHAEL

I meant to head for the castle, I

ended up at the sports-field.

EMILY

They're in opposite directions.

MICHAEL

It's none of your business.

EMILY

He's lying.

CARLA

He's not lying. Michael never lies.

MICHAEL

Dad, I've decided, I want to go

back to school tomorrow.

CARLA

The doctor says you need another

three weeks.

MICHAEL

Well I'm going.

CARLA

Peter?

PETER

If he wants to go back, then he

must.

11.

HANNA

All right, kid, it's not just about

you.

MICHAEL

What's your name?

HANNA

What?

MICHAEL

Your name.

HANNA

Why do you want to know?

MICHAEL

I've been here three times. You

haven't told me your name.

12.

HANNA

It's Hanna. What's yours, kid?

MICHAEL

Michael.

HANNA

Michael. Hmm. So I'm with a

Michael.

MICHAEL

`Hanna'.

TEACHER

The notion of secrecy is central to

Western literature. You may say the

whole idea of character in fiction

is defined by people holding

specific information which for

various reasons - sometimes

perverse, sometimes noble - they

are determined not to disclose.

13.

HANNA

You never tell me what you've been

studying.

MICHAEL

Studying?

HANNA

At school. Do you learn languages?

MICHAEL

Yes.

HANNA

What languages?

MICHAEL

Latin.

HANNA

Say something in Latin.

MICHAEL

Oh...

MICHAEL

Quo, quo scelesti ruitis? Aut cur

dexteris aptantur enses conditi?

MICHAEL

It's Horace.

HANNA

It's wonderful.

MICHAEL

Do you want some Greek?

MICHAEL

Oi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon

oi da naon phais epi gan malainan

emmenai kalliston, ego de ken otto

tis eratai.

HANNA

It's beautiful.

14.

MICHAEL

How can you tell? How do you know

when you've no idea what it means?

HANNA

What about in German?

MICHAEL

In German?

HANNA

Do you have anything?

MICHAEL

Well, I'm writing an essay. It's

about a play. By a writer called

Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Perhaps

you've heard of him?

MICHAEL

The play's called Emilia Galotti.

HANNA

Have you got it?

MICHAEL

Here. You can read it.

HANNA

I'd rather listen to you.

MICHAEL

All right. I'm not very good.

MICHAEL

Act One. Scene One. The setting :

one of the prince's chambers.

Prince - "Complaints, nothing but

complaints, petitions, nothing but

petitions. For goodness' sake, just

imagine that people actually envy

us."

15.

HANNA

You're good at it, aren't you?

MICHAEL

Good at what?

HANNA

Reading.

HANNA

Why are you smiling?

MICHAEL

Because I didn't think I was good

at anything.

16.

MICHAEL

What was all that about?

MICHAEL

I got up - at 4.30 - specially -

it's the first day of the holidays,

I'd been planning to surprise you -

HANNA

Poor little baby. Got up at four

thirty - and on your holidays too.

MICHAEL

What is this? I was on your tram!

You totally ignored me! What do you

think I was doing? Why the hell do

you think I was there?

17.

HANNA

I haven't the slightest idea. And

what you do is your business not

mine.

HANNA

And if you wanted to speak to me, I

was in the first carriage. So why

did you sit in the second?

HANNA

And now, thanks very much, I've

been working, I need a bath. Get

out, I'd like to be by myself.

MICHAEL

I didn't mean to upset you.

HANNA

You don't have the power to upset

me. You don't matter enough to

upset me.

MICHAEL

I don't know what to say. I've

never been with a woman. We've been

together four weeks and I can't

live without you. I can't. Even the

thought of it kills me.

MICHAEL

I sat in the second carriage

because I thought you might kiss

me.

HANNA

Kid, you thought we could make love

in a tram?

18.

MICHAEL

Is it true what you said? That I

don't matter to you?

MICHAEL

Do you forgive me?

MICHAEL

Do you love me?

HANNA

Do you have a book?

MICHAEL

Oh. Well I do. I took something

with me this morning.

HANNA

What is it?

MICHAEL

It's another play.

HANNA

We're changing the order we do

things. Read to me first, kid. Then

we make love.

MICHAEL

Intrigue and Love, a play by

Friedrich Schiller...

19.

MICHAEL

The Odyssey by Homer.

HANNA

What's an odyssey?

MICHAEL

It's a journey. He sets out on a

journey.

MICHAEL

"Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the

man of twists and turns

Driven time and again off course,

once he had plundered

The hallowed heights of Troy.

Many cities of men he saw and

learned their minds,

Many pains he suffered, heartsick

at the open sea,

Fighting to save his life and bring

his comrades home...

MICHAEL

"And we will some new pleasures

prove of golden sands and crystal

brooks, with silken lights and

silver hooks..."

HANNA

Come here.

MICHAEL

I poked into the place aways and

encountered a little open patch as

big as a bedroom, all hung around

with vines and found a man lying

there asleep, and by Jinks it was

my old Jim...

20.

MICHAEL

"Lady Chatterley felt his naked

flesh against her as he came into

her. For a moment he was still

inside her...

HANNA

This is disgusting. Where did you

get this?

MICHAEL

I borrowed it from someone at

school.

HANNA

You should be ashamed. Go on.

MICHAEL

`Blistering Barnacles and a

thundering typhoon. It is water.'

`But what on earth did you expect

it to be?'

HANNA

Whisky.

MICHAEL

Whisky! By thunder, whisky.

`Whisky? Come now captain, you

can't be serious.'

HANNA

All right, kid, that's enough for

today.

21.

MICHAEL

I was wondering, do you think you

could get some time off? Maybe we

could go for a trip.

HANNA

What sort of trip?

MICHAEL

I'd love to go bicycling. Just for

two days.

MICHAEL

I've got a guide-book. I've worked

out the route. Look, what do you

think?

HANNA

I think you like planning, don't

you?

MICHAEL'S VOICE

"I'm not frightened. I'm not

frightened of anything. Why should

I be? I welcome obstacles, because

they'll be like mountains I can fly

over to be in your arms. The more I

suffer, the more I'll love...

22.

MICHAEL'S VOICE

"Danger will only increase my love,

it will sharpen it, it will give it

spice. I'll be the only angel you

need. On this arm, Luise, you will

go dancing through life. You will

leave life even more beautiful than

you entered it. Heaven will take

you back and look at you and say

`Only one thing can make a soul

complete, and that thing is love.'

WAITRESS

So what would you like to have?

MICHAEL

What are you having?

HANNA

You order. I'll have what you have.

BOYS

There's sausages, sausages or

sausages. Give it to me, come on,

give it here. Let me have a look.

You always have the same thing.

WAITRESS

I hope your mother was happy.

23.

MICHAEL

Thank you. She enjoyed her meal

very much.

MICHAEL

Here, let me show you where we're

going.

HANNA

It's OK, kid. I don't want to know.

HANNA

What are you doing?

MICHAEL

I'm writing a poem. About you.

HANNA

Can I hear it?

MICHAEL

It's not ready. I'll read it to you

one day.

24.

GERHARD

You all right, Michael?

MICHAEL

I'm fine.

GERHARD

You'd better hurry. You know what

she's like.

25.

SOPHIE

I'm just going to pretend I've been

here for years, I'm not going to

behave in any special way.

GIRL

You just wait. You wait and see.

TEACHER

Good morning, ladies. Gentlemen,

please welcome your new fellow-

students, treat them with courtesy,

please.

SOPHIE

Hello. My name's Sophie.

MICHAEL

I'm Michael.

TEACHER

Everyone believes that Homer's

subject is homecoming. In fact, The

Odyssey is a book about a journey.

Home is a place you dream of, it's

not a place you ever attain.

26.

TEACHER

Berg, I don't mean to distract you,

but we're meant to studying Homer,

not studying Sophia.

HOLGER

Michael the water's fantastic.

MICHAEL

It's wonderful, isn't it?

HOLGER

Wonderful. It's going to be a great

summer.

HOLGER

Now the Americans have allowed us

back in our own lake.

SOPHIE

Why are they so loud?

HOLGER

You should see their stores. They

have everything.

MICHAEL

Oh sure. Everything mankind could

ever dream of.

SOPHIE

You don't like Americans?

MICHAEL

Just it's more fun without them.

27.

SOPHIE

Why do you leave early?

HOLGER

He always leaves early.

MICHAEL

I'm sorry I'm late. I was held up

at school.

MICHAEL

The Lady with the Little Dog. By

Anton Chekhov.

MICHAEL

"The talk was that a new face had

appeared on the promenade, a lady

with a little dog."

SUPERVISER

Schmitz, one moment. We've got good

news for you. Your work is good,

we're going to promote you. To work

with me in the office. It's more

money. Congratulations.

28.

HOLGER

Get a move on, we're leaving early

today.

MICHAEL

Why? What for?

HOLGER

We're going back to Sophie's. It's

your birthday. We're giving you a

party.

SOPHIE

Come on, it's a surprise. We

thought you'd like it. We've been

planning it for weeks.

MICHAEL

I'm sorry. Really. I promised

someone I'd do something else.

HANNA

Oh kid, kid. Stop.

MICHAEL

What's wrong?

HANNA

Nothing's wrong. It's nothing.

MICHAEL

You never ask, you never bother to

ask how I am.

29.

HANNA

You never say.

MICHAEL

It just happens to be my birthday.

It's my birthday, that's all. In

fact, you've never even asked when

it is.

HANNA

Look if you want a fight, kid...

MICHAEL

No, I don't want a fight. What's

wrong with you?

HANNA

What business is it of yours?

MICHAEL

It's always on your terms.

Everything. We do what you want.

It's always what you want. My

friends were giving me a party!

HANNA

Well then why are you here? Go back

to your party. Isn't that what you

want?

MICHAEL

And it's always me that has to

apologize.

HANNA

You don't have to apologize. No-one

has to apologize. No-one can make

you.

HANNA

War and Peace, kid.

30.

HANNA

Now you must go back to your

friends.

SOPHIE

Michael. You all right?

31.

EMILY

It's him.

CARLA

Where were you last night? What

happened?

MICHAEL

I stayed at a friend's.

PETER

Carla.

PETER

Get the boy something to eat. I

think we all knew you'd come back

to us eventually.

32.

ASSISTANT

Mr Berg. It is eight o'clock. Your

daughter.

MICHAEL

Thank you.

JULIA

I was early.

MICHAEL

Julia.

MICHAEL

Welcome back.

MICHAEL

So how will you decide?

JULIA

I don't know. I'm happy back in

Berlin, I suppose.

MICHAEL

You've seen your mother?

JULIA

I wanted to get away. There was

nothing more to it. It was Paris,

but it could have been anywhere.

MICHAEL

Away from your parents?

33.

MICHAEL

I'm aware I was difficult. I wasn't

always open with you. I'm not open

with anyone.

JULIA

I knew you were distant. I'd always

assumed it was my fault.

MICHAEL

Julia. How wrong can you be?

MICHAEL

I admit it now, I was nervous.

JULIA

I was nervous too. It's silly isn't

it?

MICHAEL

It is silly.

JULIA

Thank you for dinner.

MICHAEL

I'll see you very soon.

JULIA

Good night, Dad.

MICHAEL

Julia, wait. I want to ask you a

favour.

JULIA

What favour?

34.

MICHAEL

I want to take you on a trip. I

want to show you something.

JULIA

When?

MICHAEL

Tomorrow, maybe. Can I pick you up

in the car?

MICHAEL

At ten, say.

MICHAEL

Then good.

LECTURER

Those of you for the special

seminar group on The Legal System

in the Third Reich, please stay on

in this room. Professor Rohl will

be here in a moment.

ROHL

Well, we seem to be quite a small

group. A small group and a select

one. Clearly, this is going to be a

unique seminar. Let me start by

thanking those of you who've chosen

to take part. Good for you. A

reading list, gentlemen.

(MORE)

35.

ROHL (cont'd)

Karl Jaspers, The Question of

German Guilt...

MARTHE

And ladies.

MARTHE

So this is where you are.

MICHAEL

Yes. Come in.

MARTHE

You take work seriously.

MICHAEL

Oh I don't know.

MARTHE

You're rather a serious boy.

MICHAEL

It's how I was brought up. What

about you? Are you serious?

MARTHE

You're sure you want to work

tonight?

MICHAEL

Well I do. But I won't work every

night.

MARTHE

See you tomorrow.

36.

MICHAEL

Why all the police?

ROHL

They're worried about

demonstrators.

MICHAEL

For or against?

ROHL

Both.

CLERK

All photographers are now asked to

leave.

JUDGE

The defendants, please.

JUDGE

The first thing I'm going to do is

hear motions from each of the

defendants' lawyers.

(MORE)

37.

JUDGE (cont'd)

They're going to be arguing that

there's no reason to keep the

defendants in jail until the

outcome of the forthcoming trial.

JUDGE

I am going to take these cases one

by one.

MICHAEL

Do you want a pen?

MARTHE

I've got a pen.

JUDGE

Hanna Schmitz.

JUDGE

Your name is Hanna Schmitz?

HANNA

Yes.

JUDGE

Can you speak louder please?

HANNA

My name is Hanna Schmitz.

JUDGE

Thank you. You were born on October

21st, 1922?

38.

HANNA

Yes.

JUDGE

At Hermannstadt. And you're now 43

years old?

HANNA

Yes.

JUDGE

You joined the SS in 1943?

HANNA

Yes.

JUDGE

What was your reason? What was your

reason for joining?

JUDGE

You were working at the Siemens

factory at the time?

HANNA

Yes.

JUDGE

You'd recently been offered a

promotion. Why did you prefer to

join the SS?

JUDGE

I'll re-phrase my question. I'm

trying to ascertain if she joined

the SS freely. Of her own free

will.

JUDGE

Well?

HANNA

I heard there were jobs.

JUDGE

Go on.

39.

HANNA

I was working at Siemens when I

heard the SS was recruiting.

JUDGE

Did you know the kind of work you'd

be expected to do?

HANNA

They were looking for guards. I

applied for a job.

JUDGE

And you worked first at Auschwitz?

HANNA

Yes.

JUDGE

Until 1944. Then you were moved to

a smaller camp near Cracow?

HANNA

Yes.

ROHL

Are you OK?

MICHAEL

I'm fine.

JUDGE

You then helped move the prisoners

west in the winter of 1944 in the

so-called death marches?

ROHL

So what did you think?

40.

MICHAEL

I don't know. It wasn't quite what

I expecting.

ROHL

Wasn't it? In what way? What were

you expecting?

DIETER

I thought it was exciting.

ROHL

Exciting?

DIETER

Yes.

ROHL

Why? Why did you think it exciting?

DIETER

Because it's justice.

ROHL

I need to correct an impression.

Dieter said yesterday this was

about justice. But is it?

(MORE)

41.

ROHL (cont'd)

If it were about justice you might

ask why has it taken so long? The

war ended twenty years ago.

Remember, there've been no

significant trials between

Nuremburg in 1946 and the Auschwitz

trials a couple of years ago.

That's a long gap. What's the

reason for the gap?

DIETER

I'd have thought it was obvious.

ROHL

Say.

DIETER

Cowardice. It's cowardice, isn't

it? It's bad conscience. It's the

big cover-up.

ROHL

Go on.

DIETER

After the war. The German people

didn't want to look at what they'd

done.

ROHL

Is that right?

DIETER

Because they had too much to hide.

All our parents are liars. All

right, mine are. So it's left to

us, isn't it?

ROHL

How so?

DIETER

Because we're not implicated.

ROHL

Aren't you? Good. So that's all

right then.

42.

MARTHE

No, but seriously, Dieter's right.

My parents, I can't even talk to

them. I don't love them. How could

I? How could anyone love them?

Because they've told themselves so

many lies, they can't remember the

truth, let alone admit it. Isn't

that why we signed up for this

seminar?

ROHL

I don't know. You tell me.

MARTHE

Speaking for myself.

ROHL

Michael?

MICHAEL

I'm not sure any more.

ROHL

What did your father do, Dieter?

DIETER

If you want to know, he was in the

Waffen SS.

DIETER

That's what I mean, that's what I'm

saying. So were a million other

Germans.

ROHL

That's exactly my point. That's why

it's better not to pretend this is

about justice. Forgive me, nor is

it about getting into an emotional

state. It has no purpose if it's

just the young giving their parents

a bad time.

MARTHE

So what is it about? What do you

think?

43.

ROHL

Societies think they operate by

something called morality. But they

don't. They operate by something

called law. You're not guilty of

anything merely by working at

Auschwitz. 8,000 people worked at

Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been

convicted, and only 6 for murder.

To prove murder you have to prove

intent. That's the law. Remember,

the question is never `Was it

wrong?' but `Was it legal?' And not

by our laws, no, by the laws at the

time.

DIETER

But isn't that...

ROHL

What?

DIETER

Narrow?

ROHL

Yes. The law is narrow.

ROHL

On the other hand, I suspect people

who kill other people tend to be

aware that it's wrong.

JUDGE

Miss Schmitz, you're familiar with

this book...

HANNA

Yes...

JUDGE

Parts of it have already been read

out in court.

(MORE)

44.

JUDGE (cont'd)

It's an American publication, which

has been translated. It's by a

survivor, a prisoner who survived,

Ilana Mather...

HANNA

Yes I know. I know Ilana Mather.

JUDGE

She was in the camp, wasn't she,

when she was a child? She was with

her mother.

JUDGE

In the book, she describes a

selection process. At the end of

the month's labour, every month,

sixty inmates were selected. They

were picked out to be sent from the

satellite camp back to Auschwitz.

That's right, isn't it?

HANNA

Yes, it's right.

JUDGE

And so far, each of your fellow

defendants has specifically denied

being part of that process. Now I'm

going to ask you. Were you part of

it?

HANNA

Yes.

JUDGE

So you helped make the selection?

HANNA

Yes.

JUDGE

You admit that? Then tell me, how

did that selection happen?

45.

HANNA

There were six guards, so we

decided we'd choose ten people

each. That's how we did it - every

month. We'd all choose ten.

JUDGE

Are you saying your fellow

defendants took part in the

process?

HANNA

We all did.

JUDGE

Even though they've denied it? But

you admit it. You're saying you

took part in the process.

JUDGE

Did you not realise you were

sending these women to their

deaths?

HANNA

Yes but there were new arrivals,

new women were arriving all the

time, so of course we had to move

some of the old ones on.

JUDGE

I'm not sure you understand...

HANNA

We couldn't keep everyone. There

wasn't room.

JUDGE

No, but what I'm saying : let me

rephrase : to make room, you were

picking women out and saying `You

you and you have to be sent back to

be killed.'

46.

HANNA

Well, what would you have done?

HANNA

So should I never have signed up at

Siemens?

CLERK

Ms. Mather, they're ready for you

now.

PROSECUTOR

In your book you describe the

process of selection...

ILANA

Yes. You were made to work and

then, when you were no longer any

use to them, then they sent you

back to Auschwitz to be killed.

47.

PROSECUTOR

Are there people here today who

made that selection?

ILANA

Yes.

PROSECUTOR

I need you to identify them. Can

you please point them out?

ILANA

Her. And her. And her. And her. And

her. And her.

ILANA

Each of the guards would choose a

certain number of women. Hanna

Schmitz chose differently.

JUDGE

In what way differently?

ILANA

She had favourites. Girls, mostly

young. We all remarked on it, she

gave them food and places to sleep.

In the evening, she asked them to

join her. We all thought - well,

you can imagine what we thought.

ILANA

Then we found out - she was making

these women read aloud to her. They

were reading to her. At first we

thought this guard, this guard is

more sensitive, she's more human,

she's kinder. Often she chose the

weak, the sick, she picked them

out, she seemed to be protecting

them almost. But then she

dispatched them. Is that kinder?

48.

JUDGE

I want to move on now to the march.

As I understand it, you and your

daughter were marched for many

months.

ROSE

Yes. It was the winter of 1944. Our

camp was closed down, we were told

we had to move on. But the plan

kept changing every day. Women were

dying all around us in the snow.

Half of us died on the march. My

daughter says in the book, less a

death march, more a death gallop.

JUDGE

Please tell us about the night in

the church.

ROSE

That night we actually thought we

were lucky because we had a roof

over our heads. We'd arrived in a

village, as always, the guards took

the best quarters, they took the

priest's house. But they let us

sleep in a church. There was a

bombing raid. In the middle of the

night. At first we could only hear

the fire, it was in the steeple.

Then we could see burning beams,

and they began to crash to the

floor. Everyone rushed, rushed to

the doors. But the doors had been

locked on the outside.

49.

JUDGE

The church burned down? Nobody came

to open the doors? Is that right?

ROSE

Nobody.

JUDGE

Even though you were all burning to

death?

JUDGE

How many people were killed?

ROSE

Everyone was killed.

JUDGE

How did you survive?

ROSE

I needed to get away from the other

women. Because they were panicking,

they were screaming. I couldn't

stand it. I couldn't stand their

screaming. I was more frightened of

the other women than I was of the

fire. So I too my daughter and led

her to the upper floor. I can't

defend what I did. It's impossible

to defend. I took Ilana in my arms

and I led her towards the fire.

There was a small gallery at the

side of the church on the upper

level. It saved our lives. The

gallery didn't burn.

JUDGE

Thank you. I want to thank you for

coming to this country today to

testify.

50.

DIETER

I don't know. I don't know what

we're doing any more.

ROHL

Don't you?

DIETER

You keep telling us to think like

lawyers, but there's something

disgusting about this.

ROHL

How so?

DIETER

This didn't happen to the Germans.

It happened to the Jews.

DIETER

What are we trying to do?

MICHAEL

We're trying to understand.

DIETER

Six women locked    three hundred Jews

in a church, and    let them burn.

What is there to    understand? Tell

me, I'm asking :    what is there to

understand?

DIETER

I started out believing in this

trial, I thought it was great, now

I think it's just a diversion.

ROHL

Yes? Diversion from what?

DIETER

You choose six women, you put them

on trial, you say `They were the

evil ones, they were the guilty

ones'. Brilliant!

(MORE)

51.

DIETER (cont'd)

Because one of the victims happened

to write a book! That's why they're

on trial and nobody else. Do you

know how many camps there were in

Europe?

DIETER

People go on about how much did

everyone know? `Who knew?' `What

did they know?' That isn't the

question. The question is `How

could you let it happen?' And -

better - `Why didn't you kill

yourself when you found out?'

DIETER

Thousands! That's how many. There

were thousands of camps. Everyone

knew.

DIETER

Look at that woman...

MICHAEL

Which woman?

DIETER

The woman you're always staring at.

I'm sorry but you are.

MICHAEL

I don't know which woman you mean.

DIETER

You know what I'd do? Put the gun

in my hand, I'd shoot her myself.

52.

JUDGE

Why did you not unlock the doors?

JUDGE

Why did you not unlock the doors?

JUDGE

I've asked all of you and I'm

getting no answer. Two of the

victims are in this court. They

deserve an answer.

JUDGE

Here, this is the SS report. You

all have copies.

53.

JUDGE

This is the report which was

written, approved and signed by all

of you immediately after the event.

In the written report, you all

claim you didn't even know about

the fire until after it happened.

But that isn't true, is it?

JUDGE

Well? It isn't true.

HANNA

I don't know what you're asking.

JUDGE

The first thing I'm asking is, why

didn't you unlock the doors?

HANNA

Obviously. For the obvious reason.

We couldn't.

JUDGE

Why? Why couldn't you?

HANNA

We were guards. Our job was to

guard the prisoners. We couldn't

just let them escape.

JUDGE

I see. And if they escaped, then

you'd be blamed, you'd be charged,

you might even be executed?

HANNA

No.

JUDGE

Well then?

HANNA

If we opened the doors, then there

would have been chaos. How could we

have restored order?

(MORE)

54.

HANNA (cont'd)

It happened so fast. It was

snowing. The bombs - There were

flames all over the village. Then

the screaming began. It got worse

and worse. And if they'd all come

rushing out, we couldn't just let

them escape. We couldn't. We were

responsible for them.

JUDGE

So you did know what was happening?

You did know? You made a choice.

You let them die rather than risk

letting them escape.

JUDGE

The other defendants have made an

allegation against you. Have you

heard this allegation?

JUDGE

They say you were in charge.

HANNA

It isn't true. I was just one of

the guards.

JUDGE

Did you write the report?

HANNA

No. No. We all discussed what to

say. We all wrote it together.

BECKHART

She wrote it! She wrote the report.

She was in charge.

JUDGE

Is that true?

HANNA

No. And I didn't write the report.

Does it matter who did?

55.

JUDGE

I need to see a sample of your

handwriting.

HANNA

My handwriting?

JUDGE

Yes. I need to establish who wrote

the report.

HANNA'S COUNSEL

I'm sorry, but I really don't see

how that's appropriate. Nearly

twenty years have gone by.

JUDGE

Somebody take her this piece of

paper.

HANNA'S COUNSEL

Are you really going to compare

handwriting of twenty years ago,

with handwriting of today?

JUDGE

Give her the paper. Counsel,

approach the bench.

HANNA

There's no need. I wrote the

report.

56.

ROHL

You've been skipping seminars.

ROHL

So?

MICHAEL

I have a piece of information.

Concerning one of the defendants.

Something they're not admitting.

ROHL

What information?

ROHL

You don't need me to tell you. It's

perfectly clear you have a moral

obligation to disclose it to the

court.

MICHAEL

It happens this information is

favourable to the defendant. It can

help her case. It may even affect

the outcome, certainly the

sentencing.

ROHL

So?

MICHAEL

There's a problem. The defendant

herself is determined to keep this

information secret.

57.

ROHL

A moment, please. Please.

ROHL

What are her reasons?

MICHAEL

Because she's ashamed.

ROHL

Ashamed? Ashamed of what?

ROHL

Have you spoken to her?

MICHAEL

Of course not.

ROHL

Why of course not?

MICHAEL

I can't. I can't do that. I can't

talk to her.

ROHL

What we feel isn't important. It's

utterly unimportant. The only

question is what we do.

ROHL

If people like you don't learn from

what happened to people like me,

then what the hell is the point of

anything?

GUARD

You have a visitor. Michael Berg.

58.

GUARD

Time's up.

MARTHE

You've taken your time.

59.

MARTHE

Where are you going?

MICHAEL

I'm sorry. I need to sleep by

myself.

60.

JUDGE

The court finds guilty the

defendants Rita Beckhart, Karolina

Steinhof, Regina Kreutz, Angela

Zieber, Andrea Luhmann jointly

aiding and abetting murder in three

hundred cases. The court finds the

defendant Hanna Schmitz guilty of

murder in three hundred cases.

JUDGE

The court sentences the accused as

follows. Rita Beckhart, Karolina

Steinhof, Regina Kreutz, Angela

Zieber, and Andrea Luhmann, you

will each serve a total sentence in

prison of four years and three

months.

JUDGE

Hanna Schmitz, in view of your own

admissions and your special role,

you are in a different category.

The court sentences the accused

Schmitz to imprisonment for life.

61.

JULIA

Where are we going?

MICHAEL

I said : I'll tell you when we get

there. You told me you liked

surprises.

JULIA

I like surprises.

MICHAEL

She's grown, hasn't she?

CARLA

I don't know. It's so long since I

saw her, Michael, how can I tell?

MICHAEL

My fault. We shouldn't have come

unannounced.

JULIA

Daddy, why's she angry?

MICHAEL

I'm afraid I've have some bad news.

Julia knows.

(MORE)

62.

MICHAEL (cont'd)

We've already told her. Gertrud and

I are getting a divorce.

JULIA

Daddy's going to live in his own

house.

CARLA

You didn't come for your father's

funeral, but you come for this?

MICHAEL

You know, it's not easy for me to

visit this town.

CARLA

Were you really so unhappy?

MICHAEL

That's not what I'm saying. It's

not what I meant.

CARLA

Well then?

MICHAEL

You mustn't worry about Gertrud.

I'm going to look after her. And

anyway, let's face it, she's

already a state prosecutor, she

earns far more than I do.

CARLA

Michael, I'm not worried about

Gertrud. I'm worried about you.

63.

JULIA

Hello Mummy.

GERTRUD

Hello beautiful.

GERTRUD

Do you mind if I don't ask you in?

MICHAEL

I don't mind at all. I've a lot to

do, in fact.

MICHAEL

I took her to see where I grew up.

GERTRUD

You went to the West? My God, what

a trip.

JULIA

We went to say hello to granny.

GERTRUD

Oh. Daddy took you to see Carla,

did he?

JULIA

She was strange.

GERTRUD

Come on, let's see what's on TV.

GERTRUD

I bet she was strange.

MICHAEL

You could say.

GERTRUD

She always was. Why on earth did

you decide to do that?

MICHAEL

I don't know. Impulse.

64.

MICHAEL

I suppose if I'm honest we went

because I wanted to re-establish

contact.

GERTRUD

With your mother? And did you

succeed?

MICHAEL

Are you all right?

GERTRUD

Michael you're meant to be an

intelligent man. Don't you know,

it's very hard to receive contact

if you're not willing to give it?

GERTRUD

Say goodbye to Julia.

JULIA

Goodbye, Daddy.

MICHAEL

"Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the

man of twists and turns

Driven time and again off course,

Testing. Testing. 1-2-3.

The Odyssey by Homer.

66.

MICHAEL

The Odyssey by Homer.

"Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the

man of twists and turns

Driven time and again off course,

The hallowed heights of Troy...

Many cities of men he saw and

mortals blame the gods.

From us alone, they say, come all

The Lady with the Little   Dog, by

Anton Chekhov. "The talk   was that a

new face had appeared on   the

promenade, a lady with a   little

dog..."

HANNA

I want to take out a book.

LIBRARIAN

Which book?

HANNA

Do you have The Lady with the

Little Dog?

LIBRARIAN

What's your name?

HANNA

Hanna Schmitz.

68.

MICHAEL'S VOICE

The Lady with the Little Dog, a

story by Anton Chekhov. The talk

was...

69.

MS BRENNER (VOICE ON PHONE)

You're Michael Berg?

MICHAEL'S VOICE

Yes.

MS BRENNER (VOICE ON PHONE)

You got my letter?

MICHAEL

I have it here.

MS BRENNER (PHONE)

As I say, Hanna Schmitz is coming

up for release very soon.

70.

MS BRENNER

Hanna has been in prison for over

twenty years. She has no family.

She has no friends. You're her only

contact. And I'm told you don't

visit her.

MICHAEL

No. I don't.

MS BRENNER

When she gets out, she's going to

need a job. She's going to need

somewhere to live. You can't

imagine how frightening the modern

world will seem to her.

MICHAEL

Yes. I'm still here.

MS BRENNER

I have no-one else to ask. If you

don't take responsibility for her,

then Hanna has no future at all.

MICHAEL

It's kind of you. Thank you for

letting me know.

71.

MS BRENNER

You're Michael Berg?

MICHAEL

Yes.

MS BRENNER

Louisa Brenner. We were expecting

you earlier.

MS BRENNER

I should warn you: for a long time

Hanna held herself together. She

was very purposeful. In the last

few years she's different. She's

let herself go.

MS BRENNER

They're in the canteen. They're

just finishing lunch.

72.

HANNA

You've grown up, kid.

MICHAEL

I've got a friend who's a tailor,

he makes my suits. He'll give you a

job. And I've found you somewhere

to live. It's a nice place. Quite

small but nice. I think you'll like

it.

HANNA

Thank you.

MICHAEL

There are various social

programmes, cultural stuff I can

sign you up for. And there's a

public library very close.

MICHAEL

You read a lot?

HANNA

I prefer being read to.

HANNA

That's over now, isn't it?

HANNA

Did you get married?

MICHAEL

I did. Yes I did. We have a

daughter. I'm not seeing as much of

her as I would like. I'd like to

see a great deal more of her.

MICHAEL

The marriage didn't last.

73.

MICHAEL

Have you spent a lot of time

thinking about the past?

HANNA

You mean, with you?

MICHAEL

No. No, I didn't mean with me.

HANNA

Before the trial I never thought

about the past. I never had to.

MICHAEL

And now? What do you feel now?

HANNA

It doesn't matter what I think. It

doesn't matter what I feel. The

dead are still dead.

MICHAEL

I wasn't sure what you'd learnt.

HANNA

I have learnt, kid. I've learnt to

read.

MICHAEL

I'll pick you up next week, OK?

HANNA

That sounds a good plan.

MICHAEL

Good. Quietly, or shall we make a

big fuss?

HANNA

Quietly.

MICHAEL

OK. Quietly.

74.

HANNA

Take care, kid.

MICHAEL

You too.

MICHAEL

See you next week.

75.

MICHAEL

She didn't pack. She never intended

to leave.

MS BRENNER

She left me a message, a sort of

will. I'll read out the bit that

concerns you.

MS BRENNER

"There is money in the old tea tin.

Give it to Michael Berg. He should

send it, alongside the 7,000 marks

in the bank, to the daughter who

wrote the book. It's for her. She

should decide what to do with it.

And tell Michael I said hello. Tell

him to get on with his life."

MS BRENNER

Do you want to see her?

76.

MICHAEL

Ms Mather?

ILANA

Yes. You're Michael Berg. I was

expecting you.

ILANA

So you must tell me: what exactly

brings you to the United States?

MICHAEL

I was already here. I was at a

conference in Boston.

ILANA

You're a lawyer?

MICHAEL

Yes.

ILANA

I was intrigued by your letter but

I can't say I wholly understood it.

You attended the trial?

MICHAEL

Yes. Almost twenty years ago. I was

a law student. I remember you, I

remember your mother very clearly.

77.

ILANA

My mother died in Israel - a good

many years ago.

MICHAEL

I'm sorry.

ILANA

Go on, please.

MICHAEL

Perhaps you heard. Hanna Schmitz

recently died. She killed herself.

ILANA

She was a friend of yours?

MICHAEL

A kind of friend. It's as simple as

this. Hanna was illiterate for the

greater part of her life.

ILANA

Is that an explanation of her

behaviour?

MICHAEL

No.

ILANA

Or an excuse?

MICHAEL

No. No. She taught herself to read

when she was in prison. I sent her

tapes. She'd always liked being

read to.

ILANA

Why don't you start by being honest

with me? At least start that way.

What was the nature of your

friendship?

78.

MICHAEL

When I was young I had an affair

with Hanna.

ILANA

I'm not sure I can help you, Mr.

Berg. Or rather, even if I could

I'm not willing to.

MICHAEL

I was almost sixteen when I took up

with her. The affair only lasted a

summer. But.

ILANA

But what?

ILANA

I see. And did Hanna Schmitz

acknowledge the effect she'd had on

your life?

MICHAEL

She'd done much worse to other

people. I've never told anyone.

ILANA

People ask all the time what I

learned in the camps. But the camps

weren't therapy. What do you think

these places were? Universities? We

didn't go there to learn. One

becomes very clear about these

things.

ILANA

What are you asking for?

Forgiveness for her? Or do you just

want to feel better yourself? My

advice, go to the theatre, if you

want catharsis. Please. Go to

literature. Don't go to the camps.

Nothing comes out of the camps.

Nothing.

79.

MICHAEL

What she wanted...what she wanted

was to leave you her money. I have

with me.

ILANA

To do what?

MICHAEL

As you think fit.

MICHAEL

Here.

ILANA

When I was a little girl, I had a

tea-tin for my treasures. Not quite

like this. It had Cyrillic

lettering. I took it with me to the

camp, but it got stolen.

MICHAEL

What was in it?

ILANA

Oh. Sentimental things. A piece of

hair from our dog. Some tickets to

operas my father had taken me to.

It wasn't stolen for its contents.

It was the tin itself which was

valuable, what you could do with

it.

ILANA

There's nothing I can do with this

money. If I give it to anything

associated with the extermination

of the Jews, then to me it will

seem like absolution and that is

something I'm neither willing nor

in a position to grant.

80.

MICHAEL

I was thinking maybe an

organization to encourage literacy.

ILANA

Good.

ILANA

Good.

MICHAEL

Do you know if there's a Jewish

organization?

ILANA

I'll be surprised if there isn't.

There's a Jewish organisation for

everything. Not that illiteracy is

a very Jewish problem.

ILANA

Why don't you find out? Send them

the money.

MICHAEL

Shall I do it in Hanna's name?

ILANA

As you think fit.

ILANA

I'll keep the tin.

81.

JULIA

Where are we going?

MICHAEL

I thought you liked surprises.

JULIA

I do. I do like surprises.

JULIA

Hanna Schmitz.

JULIA

Who was she?

MICHAEL

That's what I wanted to tell you.

That's why we're here.

JULIA

So tell me.

MICHAEL

I was 15, I was coming home from

school, I was ill...
