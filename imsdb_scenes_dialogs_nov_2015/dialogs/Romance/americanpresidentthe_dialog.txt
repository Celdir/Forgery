THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT

CUT TO:

AGENT COOPER

Liberty's moving.

JANIE

The 10:15 event's been moved inside

to the Indian Treaty Room.

SHEPHERD

(to Janie)

The 10:15 is American Fisheries?

JANIE

Yes, sir. They're giving you a

200-pound halibut.

SHEPHERD

Janie, make a note. We need to

schedule more events where somebody

gives me a really big fish.

JANIE

Yes, sir.

SHEPHERD

Janie, I was kidding.

JANIE

Of course, sir.

SHEPHERD

(to the AGENT at the

elevator)

Hey, Cooper.

AGENT COOPER

'Morning, Mr. President.

JANIE

Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment

with you this morning.

SHEPHERD

Is he upset about the speech last night?

JANIE

He seemed concerned.

SHEPHERD

Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning

unless Lewis was concerned about

something I did Sunday night.

LEWIS

You skipped the whole paragraph.

SHEPHERD

(to Janie)

And Monday morning it is.

LEWIS

"American can no longer afford to

pretend that they live in a great

society"...and then nothing. You

dumped the whole handguns paragraph.

SHEPHERD

This is a time for prudence, Lewis.

LEWIS

That was the kick-ass section.

SHEPHERD

I thought what with being the

President and all...

LEWIS

Sir, of course I didn't mean to

imply--

SHEPHERD

I thought you'd be turning cartwheels

this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job

approval.

LEWIS

That's great news, sir, but...

GROUNDKEEPER

'Morning, Mr. President.

JANIE

Charlie.

SHEPHERD

'Morning, Charlie.

LEWIS

Sir, the press is gonna need an

explanation.

SHEPHERD

For what?

LEWIS

Because you dropped the whole kick-ass

section, now we've got this thing hanging

out there.

SHEPHERD

There's a thing hanging out there?

LEWIS

"Americans can no longer afford to

pretend that they live in a great

society." Then ...nothing. No

explanation. No context. So now it's

just this thing.

SHEPHERD

And it's hanging out there?

LEWIS

Yes, sir.

SHEPHERD

Maria--

STAFFER (MARIA)

Good morning, sir.

SHEPHERD

Did they tell you I'm gonna need--

STAFFER (MARIA)

--overall consumer spending and not

just first homes. Yes, sir. We'll have

it for you in 15 minutes.

SHEPHERD

Thanks.

LEWIS

Mr. President, I really feel we need

to focus on...

SHEPHERD

Lewis, however much coffee you drink

in the morning, I want you to reduce it

by half.

LEWIS

I don't drink coffee.

SHEPHERD

Then hit yourself over the head with

a baseball bat, would you please?

JANIE

Happy birthday, Laura.

SHEPHERD

Hey, Laura, happy birthday.

STAFFER (LAURA)

Thank you, sir.

SHEPHERD

(to JANIE)

I should send her some flowers.

JANIE

You already did, sir.

MRS. CHAPIL

Good morning, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

How're you, Mrs. Chapil?

MRS. CHAPIL

Fine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left

the detailed breakdown of the approval

poll for you. He seemed to indicate that

it was very good news.

SHEPHERD

Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate.

MRS. CHAPIL

Lucy called just a moment ago. You

forgot to sign her permission slip

for her class--

JANIE

--the museum trip. I'll go get it.

SHEPHERD

(to JANIE)

What time does she get home today?

JANIE

Three-twenty.

SHEPHERD

How's my afternoon look?

JANIE

Very crowded.

SHEPHERD

Schedule some time for me at 3:30.

WOMAN (O.S.)

Buenos dias, Senor Presidente.

SHEPHERD

Too-tall McCall, how was Mexico?

ROBIN

I didn't truly appreciate it until I

came back and discovered that America

isn't a great society.

LEWIS

(to ROBIN)

He dumped a whole section.

SHEPHERD

Now there's a thing hanging out there.

ROBIN

Not a great society, sir?

SHEPHERD

Well, with you out of the country, it

wasn't, Robin. Now that you're back,

we're great again.

ROBIN

There's a press room full of people

saying "What did he mean by that?"

LEWIS

See?

SHEPHERD

(re: a memo he's been

looking at)

A.J., did you get one of these?

A.J.

Is that the letter from Solomon at

the GDC?

SHEPHERD

It would appear to be a letter from

the entire environmental community.

These people are outta control.

A.J.

I think they're just frustrated,

Mr. President.

ROBIN

Are they blaming the President for

global warming?

A.J.

Well, they don't think he caused it,

if that's what you mean.

(continuing;

to SHEPHERD)

Sir, I'm on the phone with these

people twice a week. I honestly

don't know what they want at this

point.

LEWIS

What they want is a 20 percent reduction in

fossil fuel emissions.

A.J.

It won't pass at 20 percent.

LEWIS

We haven't really tried.

A.J.

Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane

hold too many markers. If we try to

push this through and lose, there will

be a very loud thud when we hit the

ground, and that's not what you want in

an election year.

SHEPHERD

Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them

the President resents the implication

that he's turned his back on the

environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to

the floor. But we're gonna ask for a

10 percent reduction. If they want to pull

their support, fine. At 63 percent job

approval rating. I don't need their help

getting a bill passed. We gotta get going--

where's Leon?

A.J.

(to an AIDE)

Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him

the President's--

MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.)

Aaagh!

KODAK (O.S.)

Sorry! Sorry, my fault.

A.J.

(to the AIDE)

Never mind.

KODAK

Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

You all right?

KODAK

They keep moving that big ficus plant.

A.J.

We're all here, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

Okay. First, I wanted to say

congratulations. Three years ago, we

were elected to the White House by

one of the narrowest margins in history,

and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of

registered voters think we're doing a

good job.

KODAK

Wait a second. You wanted me to poll

registered voters?

SHEPHERD

But the poll also tells us what we

already knew: We don't get this

crime bill of ours through Congress

and these numbers are gonna be a

memory. So, starting today, we're

shifting it into gear.

ROBIN

Can I tell my morning press gaggle

that gun control--

A.J.

Crime control, Robin. Gun control

means we're wimps and we're soft on

crime.

LEWIS

Hang on, are we not--

A.J.

Lewis--

LEWIS

Are we not putting back the handgun

restrictions?!

A.J.

We're leaving 'em out.

LEWIS

Sir, we campaigned on this issue.

Now, I understand we took it out when

we were in the low forties, but we

can push it through now.

SHEPHERD

After the elections.

LEWIS

Sir, we may never have an opportunity

like this again. Let's take this 63

percent out for a spin and see what

it can do.

SHEPHERD

We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis.

We need it to get re-elected. For

reasons passing understanding, people

do not relate guns to gun-related crime.

A.J.

Robin, you can brief the press this

afternoon. As of today, the crime

bill's priority one on the President's

domestic agenda.

ROBIN

Got it.

A.J.

Leon, you're gonna run the war room.

We're gonna need detailed projections

for all the target districts by the

end of the week. And, Leon, don't be

a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do

what the N.R.A. does.

KODAK

Scare the shit out of 'em?

A.J.

Yeah.

KODAK

I can do that.

A.J.

Lewis, we want you to be legislative

liaison on this. You're gonna run

the show on the hill.

LEWIS

Can I just say, to return to the

subject for one moment, that it might

be easier to fight a war on drugs if

we weren't arming drug dealers.

SHEPHERD

Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights

we can win.

LEWIS

Yes, sir.

A.J.

We want to announce the crime bill at

the State of the Union, which is 72

days from today. The last nose count

put us 18 votes short.

SHEPHERD

Eighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you,

everyone. Janie, what's next?

A.J.

Thank you, Mr. President.

JANIE

Security briefing, sir.

CUT TO:

RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)

Global Defense Council...

SUSAN (V.O.)

You wanted to see me?

LEO (V.O.)

I just got off the phone with A.J.

MacInerney.

CUT TO:

SUSAN

Did the President read the letter?

LEO

The President's pissed as hell,

Susan. That letter was a stupid move.

SUSAN

It was aggressive, and we should

stand by every--

LEO

This isn't the guy who needed us four

years ago, Susan. He's incredibly

popular. He's gonna win re-election

in a walk, and he could give a shit

what we stand by! If the President

passes the most important piece of

environmental legislation in history,

and does it despite our negative

endorsement, our political weight in

the future will rank somewhere below

the Save the Spotted Owl Society.

(beat)

I'm bringing in some help.

SUSAN

We don't need another environmental

expert to confirm what every other

environmental expert--

LEO

Not an environmental expert, a

professional political strategist.

We're playing hardball with Andrew

Shepherd, and we need a heavy bat.

SUSAN

Who?

LEO

Sydney Ellen Wade.

SUSAN

Oh Christ. That woman doesn't know

the first thing about the

environmental lobby.

LEO

She's a closer, Susan. She gets the

job done.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

Try it like this and lose that.

ROBIN

(entering)

David Sasser from the Times called

and wanted to know what the White

House felt was a great society.

LEWIS

What did you tell him?

ROBIN

I told him I couldn't speak for the

President, but for my money: Bermuda.

SHEPHERD

Perfect.

JANIE

Mr. President, your cousin Judith's

come down with the flu and won't be

able to join you Thursday night.

SHEPHERD

That's too bad. Remind me to give

her a call later.

JANIE

Yes, sir.

ROBIN

You gonna go stag?

SHEPHERD

That's not a problem.

ROBIN

No. We've never gone wrong parading

you around as the lonely widower.

ROBIN

(continuing)

My God.

(beat)

I can't believe I said that.

(beat)

Mr. President, that was an incredibly

thoughtless remark. I would never

dream of insulting you or the memory

of your wife.

SHEPHERD

That's okay, forget it.

(to JANIE)

What time is it?

JANIE

It's 3:45, sir.

SHEPHERD

I'm gonna go over and say hi to Lucy.

JANIE

You have the Attorney General at 4:00

and the trade representative at 4:30.

Somewhere in there you promised NPR

five minutes.

ROBIN

Mr. President--

SHEPHERD

Robin, don't worry about it.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

No, keep going. I liked what you

were playing? What's it called?

LUCY

Scales.

SHEPHERD

Well... you play it with gusto!

LUCY

Are my lips swollen?

SHEPHERD

Are they supposed to be?

LUCY

Yeah.

SHEPHERD

Then you're doing fine.

LUCY

Whatcha got behind your back?

SHEPHERD

A little gift.

LUCY

Is it a dirt bike?

SHEPHERD

Nope.

LUCY

Is it a really old seventh-grade

textbook of yours that you're gonna

make me read cover to cover and

discuss at dinner and drive me crazy

with?

SHEPHERD

I'm not comfortable with the "really

old" part, but everything else you

said was true.

LUCY

(reading the cover)

"Understanding the Constitution."

SHEPHERD

Your social studies teacher said your

class would be starting on the

Constitution this week.

LUCY

You talked to Mr. Linder?

SHEPHERD

Yes. It's called a Parent-Teacher

Conference. Mr. Linder and I were

the key player in that discussion.

Why don't you like social studies,

Luce?

LUCY

I like it fine, Dad.

SHEPHERD

All your other teachers say you're

happy, you're enthusiastic, you've

always got your hand up...Mr. Linder

says you don't participate unless he

calls on you, and even then it's a

one-word answer.

LUCY

I don't know what to say, Dad. I

guess I'm just not...I don't know.

SHEPHERD

Luce, take a look at this book. This

is exciting stuff. It's about who we

are and what we want. Read what it

says on the first page.

LUCY

(reading)

"Property of Gilmore Junior High

School."

SHEPHERD

The next page.

LUCY

(reading)

"We, the People, of the United States,

in order to form a more perfect union..."

SHEPHERD

See? Grabs you right off the bat.

It's a page-turner.

LUCY

I can't wait.

SHEPHERD

Good, 'cause it's possible the subject

might come up at dinner tonight.

LUCY

Do you see it as part of your job to

torture me?

SHEPHERD

No, it's just one of the perks. See

you tonight.

CUT TO:

DEFENSE SECRETARY

The C-STAD hardware's been in place

for a month. We've got 22 instructors

from the Army Air Defense School waiting

to go down and train the Israelis.

A.J.

How soon can you deploy them?

CHAIRMAN

We can airlift 'em in the morning.

They'll have C-STAD operational in 20

days.

A.J.

Any security concerns?

SECURITY ADVISOR

If anybody wanted to hit it, they'd

have hit it by now.

SHEPHERD

Okay. Let's move on it. Thank you,

gentlemen.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Have a good evening, Mrs. Chapil.

MRS. CHAPIL

You too, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

I'll see you in the morning, Janie.

JANIE

You will, Mr. President.

AGENT #2

(sotto)

Liberty is moving.

A.J.

Leo Solomon brought in a hired gun

at the GDC.

SHEPHERD

It's about time.

A.J.

She's a lawyer from Virginia named

Sydney Ellen Wade. I know this woman

well. She's had a lot of success

getting congressmen elected.

SHEPHERD

Maybe we should try to steal her.

Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them

leave the room till they're clear

about that.

A.J.

You know, if you've got a free second,

maybe you could stop in and say hello.

It might smooth the way.

SHEPHERD

Mention it to Janie.

A.J.

Good.

SHEPHERD

Then let's clear this off the table

and get everybody focused on the

crime bill. I don't want to win

this. I want to win it by a couple of

touchdowns.

A.J.

We will, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

Good.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

A.J.?

A.J.

Yes?

SHEPHERD

Listen, Robin said something to me

today that I'm sure she wouldn't have

said it if...I mean, she wasn't saying

it to me, I realize...

(beat)

Ah, never mind. Have a good night.

A.J.

Good night, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

A.J., when we're out of the office

and we're alone, you can call me Andy.

A.J.

I beg your pardon?

SHEPHERD

I mean you were the best man at my

wedding, for crying out loud. Call

me Andy.

A.J.

(laughing off the

suggestion)

Whatever you say, Mr. President.

A.J.

(continuing)

Have a good night, sir.

SHEPHERD

Good night, A.J.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

SYDNEY

(to the GUARD)

Hi, my name's Sydney Ellen Wade.

SUSAN

He just needs your driver's license.

SYDNEY

(handing him her

license)

I'm from Virginia.

SUSAN

He doesn't care.

SYDNEY

(to the GUARD)

I'm here for a meeting with Mr.

MacInerney.

SUSAN

He doesn't need to know that.

SYDNEY

(to the GUARD)

Forgive me, this is my first time at

the White House. I'm trying to savor

the Capra-esque quality.

SUSAN

He doesn't know what Capra-esque

means.

GUARD

(to SUSAN)

Yeah, I do. Frank Capra, great

American director -- It's a Wonderful

Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.

(handing SYDNEY and SUSAN

their laminated passes)

Sydney Ellen Wade of Virginia. Knock

'em dead.

SYDNEY

Thanks.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

The day the government starts

subsidizing private schools is the

day we give up on public education.

EDUCATION SECRETARY

I know the proposal only scratches

the surface, but it's the least we

can do.

SHEPHERD

We're already doing the least we can

do, but I can't think of anything

better, so we'll go with this for now.

(to HUD SECRETARY)

Jerry, say hello to Linda for me.

And if I don't see you again, have a

good Thanksgiving.

HUD SECRETARY

Thank you, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

How're we doing?

JANIE

You're running four minutes ahead of

schedule.

SHEPHERD

Ahead?

JANIE

Yes, sir.

SHEPHERD

(exited)

Janie, this is unprecedented. I don't

know what to do with myself.

JANIE

Mr. MacInerney asked me to remind you

to pop your head in on--

SHEPHERD

The GDC meeting. Right.

CUT TO:

A.J.

Your concerns are not falling on deaf

ears. The environmental lobby has

known no greater alley in the White

House than President Shepherd.

SYDNEY

Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J.

SUSAN

Sydney, we should leave Mr. MacInerney

alone now. He's already given us more

time than--

SYDNEY

Susan, Mr. MacInerney doesn't want

us to leave, because Mr. MacInerney's

not yet done what he needs to do today.

SUSAN

Sir, Ms. Wade's been thrown into the

deep end of the pool on her first day.

She hasn't even had a chance to read

the report of the Quebec Conference.

SYDNEY

You're right. I haven't read it. If

someone had asked me yesterday, I'd

have told them the Quebec Conference

was made up of six professional hockey

teams. But what I do know is that it's

time for the President to run for

president again. Leon Kodak is as good

as it gets when it comes to electoral

strategy, and I'm certain he's told the

President exactly what I'd tell him:

Nail down Michigan and California,

where they make cars and airplanes --

and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if

I had read these eight hundred pages,

I would have discovered that it's the

burning of fossil fuels that's been

mostly responsible for global warming and

that the 20 percent reduction recommended

by the GDC is a necessary first step

toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse

effect that has gone unchecked by this

administration...

SUSAN

(to SYDNEY)

It's really time to--

SYDNEY

Susan, I promise you, the White House

Chief of Staff will not let us leave

here until he's broken the bad news.

A.J.

(pause)

I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although

not about Michigan and California.

The President has asked me to convey

to you that he's sending his energy

bill to the floor with a call for a

reduction of 10 percent.

A.J.

(continuing)

The President is willing to go it

alone on this, but he's asking for,

and frankly he's expecting, the full

support of the GDC.

SYDNEY

The President's expecting our full

support?

A.J.

Yes, he is.

SYDNEY

The President's dreamin', A.J.

SUSAN

Sydney!

SYDNEY

--the President has critically

misjudged reality. If he honestly

thinks that the environmental

community is going to whistle a

happy tune while rallying support

around this pitifully lame mockery of

environmental leadership just because

he's a nice guy and he's done better

than his predecessors, then your boss

is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland.

VOICE (O.S.)

Let's take him out back and beat the

shit out of him.

A.J.

Good morning, Mr. President. How are

you today?

SHEPHERD

Couldn't be better.

(to the GROUP)

I apologize for the interruption, but

A.J. asked me to stop and say hello.

You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by

any chance, would you?

SYDNEY

Mr. President, I'm...don't know what

to say. I'm speechless.

SHEPHERD

All evidence to the contrary.

SUSAN

Mr. President, we haven't met. My

name is Susan Sloan. I used to work

with Congressman Myers. I hope this

episode in no way--

SHEPHERD

Sydney?

SYDNEY

Yes, sir?

SHEPHERD

You got a second?

SYDNEY

(quietly)

Of course.

SHEPHERD

I thought maybe we might have a word

in private. Someplace a little less

intimidating.

(calling)

Janie?

JANIE

Yes, sir.

SHEPHERD

(to SYDNEY)

This is my personal assistant, Janie

Basdin. Janie, would you show Ms.

Wade into the rec room. I'll be there

in a second.

JANIE

(to SYDNEY)

This way...

SHEPHERD

Sorry to keep you waiting.

SYDNEY

Mr. President--

SHEPHERD

Is it okay if I call you Sydney?

SYDNEY

Of course. Mr. President--

SHEPHERD

Have you ever been in the Oval Office?

SYDNEY

I've just been on the regular tour.

It didn't include...

SHEPHERD

I hear it's pretty good.

SYDNEY

Mr. President, what you saw in there

was nothing more than vanity run amok.

I was showing off for a colleague who

doesn't think very much of me. It'd

be a real injustice for you to hold the

GDC accountable for my behavior today.

On top of which, I'm monumentally sorry

for having insulted you like that.

SHEPHERD

Are you under the impression that I'm

mad at you?

SYDNEY

(pause)

Well...

SHEPHERD

Sydney, seldom does a day go by that

I'm not burned in effigy.

SYDNEY

Not by a professional political

operative standing 30 feet from the

Oval Office.

SHEPHERD

No, I'll give you that.

SYDNEY

Mr. President--

SHEPHERD

Did you know that when the City

Planners sat down to design

Washington, D.C., their intention was

to build a city that would intimidate

and humble foreign heads of state?

It's true.

SYDNEY

I didn't know that.

SHEPHERD

The White House has the single

greatest home court advantage in the

modern world.

SYDNEY

Learned that one the hard way.

SHEPHERD

Sydney, this bill is important to me.

SYDNEY

Yes, sir, I'll convey your message.

SHEPHERD

But you don't believe me?

SYDNEY

The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.

SHEPHERD

It's not gonna pass at 20 percent.

It's a long shot at 10.

SYDNEY

How do you know that until you put

the full weight of the White House

behind--

SHEPHERD

Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes

shy in the House. It can't be done.

But I tell you what. I'll make you a

deal with you. If you can get 24

votes, I'll get you the last 10.

SYDNEY

Twenty-four votes?

SHEPHERD

If you can swing 24 votes by the

State of the Union, I'll promise you

full White House support.

SYDNEY

Do I have your word on that, sir?

SHEPHERD

Absolutely. Listen, are you hungry?

I skipped breakfast. You wanna have

some coffee? A donut or something?

SYDNEY

Sir, I'm a little intimidated by my

surroundings, and yes, I've gotten

off to a rocky and somewhat stilted

beginning, but don't let that

diminish the weight of my message:

The GDC has been at every president

for the last decade and a half that

global warming is a calamity, the

effects of which will be second only

to nuclear war. The best scientists

in the world have given you every

reason to take the GDC seriously.

But I'm gonna give you one more. If

you don't live up to the deal you

just made, come New Hampshire, we're

gonna go shopping for a new candidate.

SHEPHERD

You can't do that, Sydney.

SYDNEY

With all due respect, Mr. President,

who's gonna stop me?

SHEPHERD

Well, if you go through that door,

the United States Secret Service.

That's my private office.

(pointing)

You need to go out that way.

SYDNEY

(beat)

Ah.

CUT TO:

A.J.

McSorley, McCluskey and Shane know

we're making our move on the crime

bill. They're circling the wagons on

the assault weapons.

SHEPHERD

Should I meet with them?

A.J.

Let Lewis take a pass at them first.

SHEPHERD

Fine. 2 in the side.

A.J.

Nice shot, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

Nice shot, Mr. President? You won't

call me by my name when we're playing

pool.

A.J.

I will not do it playing pool, I will

not do it in a school, I do not like

green eggs and ham, I do not like

them Sam I am.

SHEPHERD

At ease, A.J., and get away from the

pocket. 9 in the corner.

A.J.

Leo Solomon phoned. He said he was

thrilled with the deal you made this

morning.

SHEPHERD

I forgot to tell you.

A.J.

It's a waste of time.

SHEPHERD

Not our time. GDC makes a big

push for the votes, and when they

come up short, we move in with the

softer bill, to get passed, we're

everybody's hero. 3 in the side.

A.J.

Also, Sydney Wade called.

SHEPHERD

Sydney Wade?

A.J.

(beat)

She wanted to apologize one more time

for her behavior. 3 in the side.

SHEPHERD

Did she say anything about me?

A.J.

(beat)

Sydney Wade?

SHEPHERD

When she called.

A.J.

Did she say anything about you?

13 in the corner.

SHEPHERD

No, it's just that we had a nice

couple of minutes together. She

threatened me and I patronized her

and we didn't have anything to eat,

but I thought there was a connection.

SHEPHERD

She didn't say anything about me?

A.J.

(quietly)

Well, no, but I could pass her a note

before study hall and--

SHEPHERD

Tell me this: Hypothetically, what

would happen--

A.J.

I feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in

the corner.

SHEPHERD

--if I called Sydney and asked her

to be my date at the State Dinner

Thursday night?

A.J.

You're not serious.

SHEPHERD

Don't I sound serious?

A.J.

The President can't just go out on

a date.

SHEPHERD

Why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did.

A.J.

You're not--

SHEPHERD

Wilson was widowed during his first

term. He meets a woman named Edith

Gault. He dated her, courted her,

married her, and somewhere in there

managed to form the League of Nations.

A.J.

Mr. President, this is an election

year. If you're looking for female

companionship, we can make

arrangements that'll insure total

privacy and--

SHEPHERD

I don't want you to get me a girl,

A.J. What is this, Vegas?

A.J.

No, sir, this is the White House.

SHEPHERD

And I'm talking about something

that in no way is at conflict with

my oath of office. I'm a single

adult, and I met a woman that I'd

like to see again socially. How's

that different from what Wilson did?

A.J.

The difference is he didn't have to

be the president on television.

You've said it a million times:

If there were a television set in every

living room 60 years ago, this country

does not elect a man in a wheelchair.

SHEPHERD

What are you saying?

A.J.

We'll take a hit.

SHEPHERD

How big?

A.J.

I don't know. Five points. Maybe

more.

SHEPHERD

Five points we're standing here

talking about?!

A.J.

It could be more.

SHEPHERD

I drop five points when Wisconsin

doesn't make it to the Rose Bowl.

5 in the corner.

A.J.

Do you want me to have Kodak put

together some numbers so we know

what we're talking about?

SHEPHERD

Yeah.

(beat)

No. No. I don't want to check a

polling sample to see if this is

okay, like I'm asking permission

to stay out an hour past curfew.

This isn't the business of the

American people.

A.J.

Mr. President, the American people

have a funny way of deciding on

their own what is and what is not

their business.

SHEPHERD

I like her, A.J.

(pause)

Stop being my chief of staff for one

minute.

A.J.

(beat)

Give her a call.

SHEPHERD

(calling out)

Janie!

(to A.J.)

She didn't say anything about me?

A.J.

She said you're taller than she

thought you'd be.

SHEPHERD

That's something.

JANIE

Yes, sir?

SHEPHERD

I need you to track down a phone

number.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

(into phone)

Richard...Richard, it wasn't funny.

I acted like a college freshman at a

protest rally.

BETH

Tell him the part about walking out

the wrong door.

SYDNEY

Oh God, I forgot about that.

(back into phone)

No, Richard...Richard, I don't want

to hear your Andrew Shepherd imitation...

BETH

I wanna hear it.

SYDNEY

I'm hanging up now, Richard...

Tonight? I was gonna go to bed early

and wake up when there's a new

president.

SYDNEY

(continuing)

The President must think I'm a third-

rate jerk.

BETH

If he thinks you're a jerk, I'm sure

he thinks you're a first-rate jerk.

SYDNEY

I'll tell you one thing, boy. I

regrouped, you gotta gimme that.

I pulled it together at the end. I

stood in the middle of the Oval

Office and I made it very clear that

from now on, he who doesn't take the

GDC seriously does so at his peril!

BETH

And then you walked out the wrong

door.

SYDNEY

Are you gonna be throwing that back

at me the rest of my life?

BETH

That's my current plan, yes.

SYDNEY

That's gonna be Leo Solomon. He said

he'd call at nine.

SYDNEY

(continuing;

into phone)

Hello?

SHEPHERD

Uh, hi, is this Sydney?

SYDNEY

(into phone)

Leo?

PHONE VOICE

No, this is Andrew Shepherd.

SYDNEY

Andrew Shepherd.

(back in the phone)

You're hilarious, Richard. You're a

regular riot.

SHEPHERD

Uhh...this isn't Richard, it's Andrew

Shepherd.

SYDNEY

Oh, really. Well, I'm so glad you

called, because I forgot to tell

you today what a nice ass you have.

I'm also impressed that you were able

to get my phone number, considering

I don't have a phone. Good night,

Richard.

SHEPHERD

(under his breath)

This used to be easier.

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

I don't believe this.

BETH

You want me to deal with him?

SYDNEY

No way. I may choke in front of

Shepherd, but Richard Reynolds I

can handle.

SYDNEY

(continuing)

Hello?

SHEPHERD

Sydney?

SYDNEY

Are you learning-impaired?!

SHEPHERD

Listen, do me a favor. Hang up the

phone.

SYDNEY

(beat)

What?

SHEPHERD

Hang up the phone. Then dial 456-1414.

When you get the White House operator,

give her your name and tell her you

want to speak to the President.

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

(to herself)

This isn't happening to me.

BETH

What's going on?

SYDNEY

(to herself)

It's not possible I did this twice in

one day.

OPERATOR

(filtered)

Good evening, the White House.

OPERATOR

(continuing; filtered)

Hello?

SYDNEY

(quietly)

My name's Sydney Ellen Wade. I'd

like to--

OPERATOR (O.S.)

(filtered)

The President's expecting your call,

ma'am. I'll put you right through.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

Hello.

SYDNEY

Mr. President, I'm sure there's an

appropriate thing to say at this

moment. Probably some formal apology

for the nice-ass remark would be in

order. I just don't quite know how

to word it.

SHEPHERD

It's my fault. I shouldn't have

called you at home. Should I call

you at the office tomorrow?

SYDNEY

No, sir, of course not. I mean --

yes, you can call me anytime you want

-- this is fine. Right now is fine.

When I said "of course not," I meat

that...You know what? The hell with it

-- I'm moving to another country.

SHEPHERD

(smiling)

What did you mean when you said you

don't have a phone.

SYDNEY

I just moved to Washington over the

weekend, and my apartment isn't ready

yet. This is my sister's apartment.

Come to think of it, how did you get

this number?

SHEPHERD

(beat)

How did I get the number. That's a

reasonable question. I don't know.

Probably the FBI.

SYDNEY

(trying to pretend

it's just another

guy on the phone)

The FBI. Sure. 'Cause i-if you want

to find someone and you're the

president, that's who you would call.

SHEPHERD

You know who else is good at that?

SYDNEY

The C.I.A.?

SHEPHERD

Well, yeah, but I was thinking of the

Internal Revenue Service. They have

computer files that...Well...I should

stop stalling. As I'm sure you know,

the French have elected themselves a

new president, and we're having a formal

state dinner at the White House, and I

was wondering -- and you're under no

obligation at all -- but I thought it

might be fun... I was wondering if you

maybe wanted to go...with me, and uh...

there it is. That's why I was calling.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Sydney? Sydney, Congress doesn't

take this long to--

SYDNEY

The President has asked me to join

him in representing our country.

I'm honored. I'm equal to the task.

And I won't let you down, sir.

SHEPHERD

(beat)

Sydney, this is just a dinner. We're

not gonna be doing espionage or

anything.

SYDNEY

No. Of course. I'm a little...uh...what

do I do? I, I mean, where do I go?

Should I meet you? Will you...

SHEPHERD

I'm gonna have a very nice woman

named Marsha Bridgeport call you.

She's the White House Social Director,

and she'll help you with anything you

want. Now when she calls you and tells

you her name is Marsha Bridgeport,

it'll help if you give her the

benefit of the doubt.

SYDNEY

Of course.

SHEPHERD

I'll see you Thursday night.

SYDNEY

Mr. President, thank you for asking

me. Really. This is a first for me.

SHEPHERD

Me too.

DISSOLVE TO:

KODAK

Who's on Indiana?

(raising his voice)

Excuse me. New people, I can't

remember your names. Raise your

hand if you're on Indiana.

KODAK

(continuing)

Put your hands down -- you're on

Illinois.

LEWIS

We've got Jarrett.

KODAK

What?

LEWIS

George Jarrett. He's ours. Solid

"yes."

KODAK

I don't believe it.

(to an INTERN)

You. New guy. "Jarrett, Democrat,

Minnesota." Slide his name on over

to "for."

(to Lewis)

We just had his name laminated under

"Undecided." How'd you get the fence

pole out of his butt?

LEWIS

I wish I could take credit. He just

said, "Lewis, I support the President

a hundred percent ." Not the bill,

the President.

LEWIS

We're gonna win this in a walk. It's

like a kissing booth at a carnival.

Give us a vote, get a photo-op with

number 63.

LEWIS

We should have gone after the

handguns.

KODAK

We gotta do one thing at a time.

LEWIS

We don't have time to do one thing at

a time.

CUT TO:

DAVID

(into phone)

Carol, it's David in Sydney Wade's

office. I want to confirm her lunch

with the Congressman.

SYDNEY

(into phone)

We could do with a little party

leadership, Mike. Is the Majority

Whip takin' a break? Congress is in

session, right, I'm not wrong about

that?

LISA

I just got off with Luther Simons.

Brock's on board.

SYDNEY

Terrific!

DAVID

You're awfully jumpy today. What do

you have -- a big date tonight?

CUT TO:

REPORTER (LLOYD)

(to the camera)

I'm standing here with Senate

Minority Leader Robert Rumson, just

one of the many guests arriving at

what, for a few hours at least, is a

non-partisan White House. Senator,

the latest public opinion survey

shows the President with approval

ratings that would make him all but

unbeatable, come next November. Is

there a Republican who can mount a

serious challenge, and are you that

candidate?

RUMSON

Lloyd, it's a long time till next

November. Right now, I'm just

looking forward to a pleasant evening.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

That's a little tight, Luce.

LUCY

It's supposed to be tight. It's

supposed to make you look regal.

SHEPHERD

Is it supposed to cut off the blood

flow to my face?

LUCY

All done.

SHEPHERD

Not bad. Where did you learn how to

do this?

LUCY

Social studies.

SHEPHERD

Very funny.

(smiles)

Really, where did you learn?

LUCY

I don't know...I just guess...

SHEPHERD

Sweetie, did Mom teach you how to do

this?

LUCY

Yeah.

SHEPHERD

(pause)

Lucy, is this okay with you? My

having dinner with a woman?

LUCY

It's totally okay.

SHEPHERD

Are you sure? Because if you want to

talk about it...

LUCY

Dad, it's cool. Go for it.

SHEPHERD

You know, I'm a little nervous.

LUCY

You'll be fine. Just be yourself.

SHEPHERD

Be myself.

LUCY

And compliment her shoes.

SHEPHERD

Her shoes?

LUCY

Girls like that.

CUT TO:

JANIE

Miss Wade? The President wants you

to join him upstairs in the

residence. May I show you the way?

CUT TO:

A.J.

Sydney, come on in. You look

beautiful.

SYDNEY

Thank you. I have no idea what I'm

doing here.

A.J.

I promise you there's no hidden

agenda.

SHEPHERD

Sydney. Andrew Shepherd. We spoke on

the phone.

SYDNEY

Yes, sir. I remember.

A.J.

You know my wife, Esther.

SYDNEY

Sure. It's nice to see you again.

ESTHER

(affectionately)

Sydney, the President told me about

how you two met. I think it's

priceless.

SYDNEY

I don't know what happened. One

minute I was calling him a mockery of

an environmental leader. The next

minute I had a date.

ESTHER

Men like being insulted by women.

It makes them feel loved. Don't ask

me why.

A.J.

Sydney, when you meet the French

President, don't make him feel too

loved, all right? We just signed a

new trade agreement.

SYDNEY

Got it.

SHEPHERD

(to D'Astier)

Mr. President, would allow me to

introduce Sydney Ellen Wade of the

Commonwealth of Virginia. Sydney,

this is President Rene-Jean D'Astier

and his wife Monique Danielle

D'Astier of France.

SYDNEY

An honor to meet you both.

JANIE

Mr. President, I'm sorry to

interrupt. The receiving line is in

place.

SHEPHERD

Sydney, it sounds like our table's

ready.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

Once we hit the bottom of the

stairs, I gotta do a thing.

You'll be escorted...

SYDNEY

They took me through it.

SYDNEY

(continuing)

Do you do this often, sir?

SHEPHERD

(beat)

This is, actually, only our second

State Dinner. The first was for the

Emperor of Japan, who died shortly

after that, so we stopped having them

for a while, just in case.

SYDNEY

I meant do you go out on...do you--

often--do you--

SHEPHERD

Do I date a lot?

SYDNEY

Well, yeah.

SHEPHERD

No. How 'bout you?

SYDNEY

Me? Lately, I seem to be going out

on a lot of first dates.

SHEPHERD

Then you're experienced at this.

SYDNEY

Oh yeah, you can ask me anything.

SHEPHERD

How are we doing so far?

SYDNEY

It's hard to say at this point. So

far it's just your typical first date

stuff.

SHEPHERD

Damn. And I wanted to find a way to

be different from the other guys.

VOICE (O.S.)

Ladies and gentlemen, the President

of the United States.

SHEPHERD

By the way, nice shoes.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

Mr. President, the President and Mrs.

D'Astier look bored. They're not

talking to anybody.

SHEPHERD

They're hammered. Esther, do you speak

French?

ESTHER

Latin.

SHEPHERD

I thought you spoke French.

ESTHER

No, Latin.

SHEPHERD

Great, next time Julius Caesar comes

to town, you're our gal. Sydney, I

don't suppose that you speak any--

SYDNEY

(taking over--

to D'Astier)

Monsieur le President, nous sommes

tous habilles, nous avons ce

merveilleux orchestre, une piece

magnifique...comment se fait-il que

les invites ne dansent pas?

SHEPHERD

(proudly to A.J. and

Esther)

That's my date.

D'ASTIER

Je ne connais pas la tradition en

Amerique, mais dans mon pays, si les

invites de Louis XVI et Marie

Antoinette avaient ose danser devant

le roi et la reine, ils auraient

perdu la tete.

SYDNEY

Really?

MADAME D'ASTIER

Absolument.

SHEPHERD

Sydney, you didn't dissolve the NATO

treaty, did you?

SYDNEY

I just said that we're sitting in this

beautiful room, listening to the music

of this wonderful orchestra, and I

wondered why nobody was dancing.

D'ASTIER

And I informed Ms. Wade that in my

country, a guest at the palace of

Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would

soon find their head in a guillotine

if they made the impertinent gesture

of dancing without so much as a

by-your-leave from the King and the Queen.

A.J.

I'll bet no one accused Louis of

being soft on crime.

SYDNEY

There's a lesson there, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

More beheadings at the White House?

A.J.

Bob Rumson would embrace it.

SHEPHERD

I'm sure he would, but I have a

better idea.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Would you like to dance?

SYDNEY

Uh, yeah, I guess. I mean, yes, sir,

I'd love to.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

I don't know how you do it.

SHEPHERD

Arthur Murray. Six lessons.

SYDNEY

That's not what I mean. Two hundred

pairs of eyes are focused on you

right now, with two questions:

"Who's this girl, and why's our

president dancing with her?"

SHEPHERD

First of all, the 200 pairs of eyes

aren't focused on me. They're

focused on you. And the answers are

"Sydney Ellen Wade" and "Because she

said 'yes.'"

LEWIS

They make a nice couple.

ROBIN

Lovely.

LEWIS

We've got troubles.

ROBIN

Huge.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

Good morning, Mrs. Chapil.

MRS. CHAPIL

Good morning, Mr. President. Mr.

Rothschild and Miss McCall are in the

office, sir. They said they needed to

speak with you before scheduling.

SHEPHERD

Fine. Janie, can you get me the

number of a local florist?

JANIE

I'll take care of it, sir. Where do

you want them sent?

SHEPHERD

I want to do it myself. I just need

the phone number.

JANIE

I don't understand.

SHEPHERD

I want the phone number of a florist.

JANIE

You just want the phone number?

SHEPHERD

Yeah.

JANIE

(beat)

I don't understand, sir, is there--

SHEPHERD

I want to send some flowers, Janie.

I want to do it myself. I don't want

to staff it out, and I don't want to

issue an Executive Order. I just

want a phone number.

JANIE

I'll get it for you right away, sir.

SHEPHERD

Thank you.

CUT TO:

ROBIN

Mr. President, we need five minutes

before scheduling if you can spare it.

SHEPHERD

(to Robin)

I just need two minutes to make a

call and I'll be right with you.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Thank you, Janie.

LEWIS

Who are we calling, sir?

SHEPHERD

I'm calling the Organization of the

United Brotherhood of It's-None-of-

Your-Damn-Business, Lewis. I'll be

with you in a minute.

LEWIS

Yes, sir.

SHEPHERD

(to the OPERATOR)

Yeah, good morning. How do I get an

outside line? Really? That's simple.

Thank you.

CUT TO:

LEWIS

Janie?

JANIE

Yes?

LEWIS

What's the President doing?

JANIE

I'm sorry, I'm really not at liberty

to say.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

Tell me something. What is the state

flower of Virginia?

CUT TO:

ROBIN

Does this have something to do with

Sydney Wade?

JANIE

I'm really not at liberty to say.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

Is there someone else there who might

know?

(beat)

No, I'm not trying to five you a hard

time, I was--hold on please.

SHEPHERD (O.S.)

(through intercom)

Janie, what's the state flower of

Virginia?

JANIE

(turning to MRS.

CHAPIL)

Mrs. Chapil. State flower of

Virginia.

MRS. CHAPIL

The dogwood.

CUT TO:

JANIE (O.S.)

(through intercom)

The dogwood, sir.

SHEPHERD

(to JANIE)

Thank you.

(into phone)

It's the dogwood.

(pause)

What? Hold on please.

(to JANIE, through

intercom)

Janie, the dogwood is a tree, not a

flower.

CUT TO:

KODAK

It's a tree and a flower.

JANIE

Are you sure?

KODAK

Yes. What's going on?

CUT TO:

JANIE (O.S.)

(through intercom)

Sir, it's a tree and a flower.

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

The dogwood is both a tree and a

flower. I'd like a dozen, please.

Really? No dogwoods? How 'bout

roses? Simple. Classic. Two dozen

roses.

CUT TO:

LEWIS

Janie, I'm the President senior

domestic policy advisor. It's

important that I have a full

understanding of--

SHEPHERD (O.S.)

Janie! Do you have any idea where

my credit cards might be?

CUT TO:

JANIE

They're in storage in Wisconsin with

the rest of your personal items.

SHEPHERD

Ah.

(into phone)

Listen, what might be better is if

you just bill me for the flowers.

I'm sure it'll be okay with your

boss. Well, I don't know if you

recognize my voice, but this is the

President.

(beat)

The United States.

(they've hung up)

Hello, hello...

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

Leo, you wanted to see me?

LEO

So there I was, thinking maybe I

should give Sydney a call. She's

new in town, doesn't know many

people...

SYDNEY

Leo--

LEO

Then I picked up the Times--

SYDNEY

It was crazy. He called me at home.

LEO

What's going on?

SYDNEY

Nothing. It was innocent. His

cousin got the flu at the last

minute.

LEO

Did you sleep with him?

SYDNEY

What?

LEO

Did you sleep--

SYDNEY

That's none of your business, Leo.

LEO

Yeah, it is, Sydney.

SYDNEY

You wanna tell me how my personal

life in any way--

LEO

Because when it's the President, it's

not personal. Sydney, I hired your

reputation. I hired a pit bull, not

a prom queen.

SYDNEY

That's unfair.

LEO

It's incredibly unfair. But you've

spent a lot of time over the year

telling me the trouble with the

environmental lobby is that we don't

understand the fundamental truth that

politics is perception. This is a

bad time to develop ignorance.

SYDNEY

You're making way too much of this.

LEO

Am I? This is your time, Sydney.

You're sitting at the grown-ups'

table. You have a chance to get

everything you want -- run a national

campaign, be a major player inside

the party. But this relationship had

better go all the way, because with

the leader of the free world there is

no halfway. Politics is perception,

and if thing don't work out, the

amount of time it'll take you to go

from being a hired gun to a cocktail

party joke can be clocked with an egg

timer.

SYDNEY

Leo, there is no relationship. It

was one night. It's done.

LEO'S SECRETARY

Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered

by White House messenger. It's

marked "Perishable."

LEO

The White House has sent me something

perishable?

LEO'S SECRETARY

It's for Ms. Wade.

LEO

Here we go...

SYDNEY

Relax, Leo. I'm sure it's just a

formality.

LEO'S SECRETARY

(exited)

It's from him.

LEO

Of course it's from him.

SYDNEY

So he had some staff flunky send

me a fruit basket.

LEO'S SECRETARY

He wrote the note himself.

SYDNEY

I'm sure he didn't take the time to--

LEO'S SECRETARY

The messenger said he was waiting in

the Oval Office for ten minutes while

the President wrote the card.

SYDNEY

Okay, listen, so he--

(to LEO'S SECRETARY)

--it took him ten minutes to write a

card?!

LEO'S SECRETARY

Apparently he went through several

drafts.

LEO

What is it...what is it?

SYDNEY

A ham.

LEO

(beat)

A ham?

SYDNEY

He sent me a Virginia ham.

LEO'S SECRETARY

Dig it, Ms. Wade. You're the

President's girlfriend.

LEO

There's never an egg timer around

when you need one.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

ROBIN

Sir, they're gonna be pressing today

about whether the White House is

prepared to soften the assault

weapons section of the crime bill.

LEWIS

There is no need to entertain that

at this point.

ROBIN

How do you want me to handle the

Sydney issue?

SHEPHERD

The Sydney issue?

LEWIS

We should have a consensus on how the

White House is going to handle it.

SHEPHERD

I sure hope the Sydney issue refers

in some way to a problem we're having

with Australia, because if it's

anything else...

JANIE

Mr. President, Ms. Wade is here to

see you.

SHEPHERD

Tell her she can come right in. I'm

finished here.

JANIE

Yes, sir.

SHEPHERD

(to LEWIS and ROBIN)

There is no Sydney issue.

SYDNEY

(to SHEPHERD)

Thanks for seeing me on such short

notice.

SHEPHERD

No problem. Did you get the ham?

SYDNEY

I got the ham, yes. Thank you very

much.

SHEPHERD

I wanted to send you flowers, but

there seem to be some kinks in the

system. I'm really glad you stopped

by. I had such a good time last

night.

SYDNEY

So did I. It's just that...

JANIE

They're 45 seconds away, sir.

SHEPHERD

I'm delivering a luncheon speech at

the Governor's Conference this

morning. I'm sorry to--

SYDNEY

No, no, that's fine. I just stopped

by to...

SHEPHERD

Are you free for dinner tomorrow night?

SYDNEY

Dinner?

SHEPHERD

Casual. In the Residence. Without

the United Nations. My daughter'll

be with us, so it may seem like the

United--

SYDNEY

I'd love to meet Lucy, but...

SHEPHERD

(reading to himself

as he talks SYDNEY)

She's gonna like you.

(calling to the AIDE)

Excuse me -- Jeff!

SYDNEY

Actually, I have some concerns that--

JEFF

Yes, sir.

SHEPHERD

(reading the note)

I can't do this.

JEFF

Which? Robbins or Stackhouse?

SHEPHERD

Either one. I have to be in and out.

JEFF

Sir, Governor Stackhouse said he just

needed 10 minutes. I think he wants

to talk about the assault weapons.

SHEPHERD

Stackhouse wants to talk about

grazing rights. Trust me.

JEFF

Got it.

SHEPHERD

(to Sydney)

Sorry. You have concerns.

SYDNEY

Yes. Not many. A few. One. I have

one concern.

SHEPHERD

Does it having anything to do with

one of us being the President?

SYDNEY

You like to make jokes about this,

but--

SHEPHERD

I am not mocking you, honest. I'm

just a guy asking a girl over for a

meal.

SYDNEY

What's that?

SHEPHERD

My ride's here.

SYDNEY

Leo Solomon has serious concerns

about my exploring a social, you

know, scenario, with the President

of the United States.

SHEPHERD

Yeah, well, when you put it that

way, it doesn't sound that great

to me either.

SYDNEY

It's just not--

SHEPHERD

Have dinner with Lucy and me. It's

meat loaf night -- how presidential

can it be?

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Seven-thirty.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

LUCY

Are you Ms. Wade?

SYDNEY

(standing up, smiling)

Sydney.

LUCY

Lucy Shepherd.

SYDNEY

Nice to meet you.

LUCY

My dad told me to tell you he's on

the phone with his dentist and that

I should behave myself and entertain

you till he gets here.

SYDNEY

Your father's on the phone with his

dentist?

LUCY

No. He told me to tell you he's on

the phone with his dentist. He wants

you to think he's a regular guy.

SYDNEY

Who is he on the phone with?

LUCY

The Prime Minister of Israel.

SYDNEY

They're probably not discussing his

teeth.

LUCY

No. They're talking about that

abbreviation I can never remember.

SYDNEY

C-STAD?

LUCY

Yeah.

SYDNEY

Capricorn Surface To Air Defense.

LUCY

Right.

SHEPHERD

Let meat loaf night begin.

SYDNEY

Everything all right with your teeth?

SHEPHERD

My teeth?

SYDNEY

The dentist.

SHEPHERD

Oh, right. I've got a cavity in my

upper bicuspid region.

SYDNEY

You've got a short-range weapons

system outside Tel Aviv.

SHEPHERD

(to LUCY)

You turned on me.

LUCY

Can we eat?

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

RUMSON (V.O.)

You're over-thinking this.

CUT TO:

RUMSON

(continuing)

Voters aren't interested in how to

achieve economic growth, and they

don't want to hear our plans to

strengthen foreign policy.

STAFFER #1

So it comes down to character.

STAFFER #2

The press like him, Senator. The

networks, the newspapers, they're--

RUMSON

Reporters like him. Networks and

newspapers like ratings and circulation.

For all the bitching we do about liberal

bias in the press when it comes down to

a character debate...

STAFFER #3

The press is an unwitting accomplice.

CARL

Bob, the character debate didn't work

out for us.

RUMSON

Because it couldn't. Our polling

told us that attacking his character

less than a year after he'd lost his

wife was gonna be a turn-off and was

gonna make people feel sorry for him.

We couldn't run the campaign we wanted

because the opponent was a widower.

CARL

He's still a widower. Time's passed,

but--

RUMSON

(to the rest)

You'll have to forgive my friend.

He's been on a hunting trip and cut

off from the world.

CARL

What's going on?

RUMSON

The President's got a girlfriend.

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

(to LUCY)

Your dad says you're studying the

Constitutional Convention.

SHEPHERD

She's not having any fun, though.

LUCY

Dad--

SYDNEY

You're not having fun?

LUCY

(to herself)

This is a nightmare. This is a

social studies nightmare.

SHEPHERD

They're doing a mock Congress. Each

kid is playing one of the original

delegates, and they debate the

Amendments. Now what's not fun about

that?

LUCY

G'night, Dad.

SHEPHERD

G'night, sweetheart.

LUCY

It was nice meeting you, Mrs.--

SYDNEY

Sydney.

LUCY

It was nice meeting you, Sydney.

SYDNEY

Thank you. It was nice meeting

you.

SHEPHERD

Sleep well, honey. I love you.

LUCY

I love you, too.

SYDNEY

She's wonderful.

SHEPHERD

She's her mother.

SYDNEY

She's you.

SHEPHERD

Would you like the 25-cent tour?

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

I thought C-STAD wasn't gonna be

operational until January.

SHEPHERD

It was ready ahead of schedule.

We've just been waiting for the

personnel.

SYDNEY

The Israelis?

SHEPHERD

No, our guys. We've sent a team of

Army instructors to train the

Israelis.

SHEPHERD:

(remembering)

I think this is the dish room.

SYDNEY

It's not the dish--

SHEPHERD

Yeah, it is. It's the room with all

the dishes.

SYDNEY

It's the China Room.

SHEPHERD

I'm more of a West Wing President.

If you're curious about the mansion,

there's probably a book you can get--

SYDNEY

There're about seven-thousand books.

I'll get one for you.

SHEPHERD

Sydney.

SYDNEY

Mr. President -- have you ever noticed

how similar the Van Buren flatware is

to the Buchanan flatware?

SHEPHERD

Do you think there will ever come a

time when you can stand in a room

with me and not think of me as the

President?

SYDNEY

This isn't a state of mind. You are

the President. And when I'm in a

room with you, oval or any other

shape, I'm always gonna be a

lobbyist, and you'll always be the

President.

SHEPHERD

I got news for you, Sydney. As a

lobbyist, you would never be alone in

a room with the President.

SYDNEY

You think this is a good idea?

SHEPHERD

Probably not.

AGENT #3 (O.S.)

Mr. President...

AGENT #3

We have a secure call from the sit-

room.

SHEPHERD

Excuse me.

AGENT #3

Sorry, ma'am.

SYDNEY

(beat)

No...of course.

SHEPHERD

Listen--

SYDNEY

Is anything wrong?

SHEPHERD

I'm sorry, we're going to have to cut

our evening short. The Libyans have

just bombed C-STAD. I'll try to call

you tomorrow.

(to the AGENT)

Can you show Ms. Wade out.

CHAIRMAN (V.O.)

The response scenario's in place...

CUT TO:

CHAIRMAN

(continuing)

...The F-18's are fired up on the

Kimitz and the Kitty Hawk. They're

just waiting for your attack order,

Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

And we're gonna hit Libyan

Intelligence Headquarters?

MAN

The N.S.A. confirmed they're the ones

who planned the bombing.

A.J.

What's the estimate?

GENERAL

We'll level the building.

SHEPHERD

Libyan I.H.Q's in the middle of

downtown Tripoli -- are we gonna hit

anything else?

GENERAL

Only if we miss.

SHEPHERD

Are we gonna miss?

GENERAL

No, sir.

SHEPHERD

How many people work in that building?

CHAIRMAN

We've been all through--

SHEPHERD

How many people work in the damn

building?

DEPUTY

I've got those number here. There

are three shifts, so it--

SHEPHERD

The fewest. What shift puts the

fewest people in the building? The

night shift, right?

DEPUTY

By far. Mostly custodial staff and

a few--

SHEPHERD

What time does the night crew go on?

DEPUTY

They're on now, sir.

SHEPHERD

A.J.?

A.J.

It's immediate, it's decisive, it's

low risk, and it's a proportional

response.

SHEPHERD

Someday somebody's going to have to

explain to me the virtue of a

proportional response.

CHAIRMAN

Mr. President?

SHEPHERD

Attack.

CUT TO:

A.J.

Robin, as soon as our planes have

cleared Libyan airspace, you can call

the press. I don't know when we'll

have the full B.D.A.--

LEWIS

General Rork says around O-Eight

Hundred.

ROBIN

Sir, what do you think about a

national address?

SHEPHERD

The last thing I want to do is put

the Lybians center stage.

KODAK

I think it's a great idea, sir. You

know Rumson's gonna be talking about

your lack of military service.

SHEPHERD

This isn't about Rumson. What I did

tonight was not about political gain.

KODAK

But it can be, sir. What you did

tonight was very presidential.

SHEPHERD

Leon, somewhere in Libyan right now

there's a janitor working the night

shift at the Libyan Intelligence

Headquarters. He's going about his

job 'cause he has no idea that in

about an hour he's gonna die in a

massive explosion. He's just going

about his job 'cause he has no idea

that an hour ago I gave an order to

have him killed. You just saw me do

the least presidential thing I do.

KODAK

yes, sir.

PRESS (V.O.)

Mr. President...Mr. President!

CUT TO:

SALLY

Is there anything at all about the

C-STAD weapons system that could have

been mistaken by Libyan Intelligence

as offensive rather than defensive?

SHEPHERD

No. We did everything but show them

the blueprints. The hardware was

sitting in a airplane hangar for a

month. They didn't hit it until the

LESLIE

Sir, there's an unconfirmed report

that you were with Sydney Wade when

you learned of the attack. Can you

comment?

A.J.

(sotto to ROBIN)

Get him off.

SHEPHERD

Yes, we'd just finished dinner.

ROBIN

Last question.

MARK

Sir, would you care to comment on

the status of your relationship?

SHEPHERD

We don't have a relationship. We

just had dinner.

CAROL

Can you tell us if she spent the

night at the White House or did--

SHEPHERD

Folks, a lot of people got killed

last night. Let's try to keep our

eyes on the ball, okay?

CUT TO:

ROBIN

That was my fault, sir. We should

have prepped you for that.

SHEPHERD

There's nothing that needs prepping.

A.J., let's meet with the leadership

after we meet with the Security

Council.

ROBIN

"Newsweek" is begging for ten minutes

today. Any ten minutes you got.

SHEPHERD

Nobody gets ten minutes today.

DISSOLVE TO:

SHEPHERD

Lewis, tell the speaker to wait.

I want to talk to him. No, I'll be

right down.

RUMSON

...Last night, the price of his

liberal programs was raised to

include the blood of 22 American

soldiers.

RUMSON

...Mr. Shepherd's read a lot of

books, but you didn't need a Harvard

degree to see this comin' a mile down

the road.

SHEPHERD

I went to Stanford, you blowhole.

RUMSON

The fat that our Commander-in-Chief

has not served one day in uniform--

CUT TO:

BETH (V.O.)

This box just says "Miscellaneous."

Is this bedroom miscellaneous or

kitchen miscellaneous?

BETH

Sydney?

SYDNEY

Why did I have to kiss him?

BETH

You kissed him?

SYDNEY

Yeah.

BETH

You didn't' tell me that.

SYDNEY

I kissed him.

BETH

Where?

SYDNEY

On the mouth.

BETH

(exasperated)

Where in the White House?!

SYDNEY

In the dish room.

BETH

The dish room?

SYDNEY

The China Room.

BETH

Then what happened?

SYDNEY

He had to go and attack Libya.

BETH

It's always something.

SYDNEY

I've gotta nip this in the bud. This

has catastrophe written all over it.

BETH

In what language?! Sydney, this man

is the leader of the free world.

He's brilliant, he's funny, he's

handsome, and he's an above-average

dancer. Isn't it possible our

standards are just a tad high?

BETH

(continuing)

Answer the phone.

SYDNEY

It's him.

BETH

Answer the phone.

SYDNEY

He's gonna ask me to come over

there.

BETH

Answer the phone.

SYDNEY

I don't want to go over there.

BETH

Answer the phone.

SYDNEY

on the phone. I'm not gonna go

over there.

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

I just came over here to tell you

why I can't see you anymore.

SHEPHERD

(to COOPER)

Thanks, Coop.

SYDNEY

Look, I know you've had a tough

day.

SHEPHERD

Not as tough as some. You want a

drink? Lemme take your coat.

SYDNEY

Mr. President, this isn't gonna work.

SHEPHERD

Sure it will. You button the top

button, and it doesn't fall off

the hanger.

SYDNEY

That's not what I...

SHEPHERD

I didn't think so. Listen...

SYDNEY

I've really enjoyed the time we've

spent together, but this has

catastrophe written all over it.

Please, Mr. President, don't pursue

me outside the political arena.

SHEPHERD

Well, I have no intention of pursuing

you inside the political arena, so

that leaves everything out, and

that's unacceptable to me.

SYDNEY

If I were on your staff, I would tell

you that the absolute worst thing you

can do coming into an election year

is to open yourself up to character

attacks, and the fastest way to do

that is to prance around like the

playboy of the Western world.

SHEPHERD

Let's clear up a couple of things.

Number 1: I seldom prance.

Number 2: I have no intention of

engaging in a character debate, and

Number 3: You're not on my staff.

SYDNEY

Yes, of course, but if you'll follow

the immutable--

SHEPHERD

Why is that, by the way?

SYDNEY

Why's that?

SHEPHERD

Why aren't you on my staff?

SYDNEY

You can't afford me.

SHEPHERD

How much do you make?

SYDNEY

More than you do, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

The name's Andy. How much money do

you make?

SYDNEY

What the hell does it matter how

much money I--

SHEPHERD

You would raise your voice to the

President?

SYDNEY

I'm only thinking about the health

of your Presidency. You think this

morning's press conference was the

end of it? Bob Rumson's gotta be

drooling over this.

SHEPHERD

Are you attracted to me?

SYDNEY

I beg your pardon?

SHEPHERD

I asked if--

SYDNEY

(of course she is)

That's not the issue--

SHEPHERD

Well, I tell you what. Let's make

it the issue. Let's try something

new, 'cause I know that most couples,

when they're first getting together,

are inclined to slam on the brakes

because they're concerned about Bob

Rumson's drool.

SYDNEY

You're not most people.

SHEPHERD

You know what your problem is?

SYDNEY

What's my problem?

SHEPHERD

Sex and nervousness.

SYDNEY

Sex and nervousness is my problem.

SHEPHERD

Yes. Last night when we were

looking at the different place

settings in the dish room, I

realized that those place settings

were provided by the First Ladies.

And I'll bet none of those First

Ladies were nervous about having

sex with their President husbands.

And you know why?

SYDNEY

No, but I'm sure you'll explain it

to me.

SHEPHERD

I will. Because they weren't

presidents when they met them. Not

the case here.

SYDNEY

Ahhhhhh.

SHEPHERD

You see what I'm getting at?

SYDNEY

Yes. May I use your bathroom for a

moment?

SHEPHERD

Sure. It's right through there.

SYDNEY

I want to freshen up.

SHEPHERD

As you pass through, you'll see a

large closet on your left. And if

you feel comfortable, hang up your

coat, and when you come back I'll

have fixed up a drink, we'll sit on

the couch, and I will explain to

you my plan.

SYDNEY

You have a plan? Don't make me

wait. You're on a roll.

SHEPHERD

(speaking up)

Okay. You're attracted to me, but

the idea of physical intimacy is

uncomfortable because you only know

me as the President. It's not always

gonna be that way, and the reason I

know that is because there was a

moment last night when you were with

me and not the President, and I know

what a big step that was for you.

So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's

my plan: We're gonna slow down.

When you're comfortable, that's

when it'll happen.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Perhaps I didn't properly explain

the fundamentals of the "Slow Down"

plan.

SYDNEY

You explained it great.

SHEPHERD

(pause)

Are you nervous?

SYDNEY

No.

SHEPHERD

Good. My nervousness exists on

several levels. Number 1 -- and

this is in no particular order --

I haven't done this in a pretty

long time. Number 2: Any expectations

you might have, due to the fact that

I'm, you know...

SYDNEY

The most powerful man in the world?

SHEPHERD

Exactly, thank you. Just so you

remember that's a political

distinction that comes with the

office. I mean, if Eisenhower were

here instead of me he'd be dead by

now. And number three...

SYDNEY

(gently)

Andy...

RUMSON (V.O.)

Does New Hampshire want traditional

American values back in the White

House?

CROWD

Yes!!

CUT TO:

RUMSON

Does New Hampshire want the pride back?

CROWD

Yeah!!!!!!!

RUMSON

My name is Bob Rumson. And I'm

running for President.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

Yeah...put him through.

(listens)

Lewis, it is 5:00 a.m. You gotta

get yourself a life, man.

(listens)

Yeah...all right.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Sydney?

SYDNEY

Hi.

SHEPHERD

What are you doing?

SYDNEY

I wanted to leave the building before

the press corps got here.

SHEPHERD

I have those same thoughts every day

of my life. Say, you know Lewis

Rothschild, don't you? Well, he's...

SYDNEY

Sure. Boy, Lewis'd go nuts if he

knew I'd spent the night.

SHEPHERD

...on his way up.

SYDNEY

What?

SHEPHERD

Come on in, Lewis.

LEWIS

'Morning, Mr. President. Hi, Sydney.

SYDNEY

Hi, Lewis. Well, Mr. President,

thank you for taking the time to go

over those fossil fuel numbers. I'll

just get my coat, and be on my way.

SHEPHERD

(to LEWIS)

What's the situation?

LEWIS

They're camped out at every exit.

SYDNEY

Who? Who's camped out?

LEWIS

The press.

SYDNEY

The press is camped out?

LEWIS

You shoulda taken a cab, Sydney.

SYDNEY

They know my car?!

ROBIN

Good morning, Mr. President. Hi,

Sydney. I came over as soon as Lewis

called.

SHEPHERD

Thank God.

ROBIN

I think the important thing is not

to make it look like we're panicking.

SHEPHERD

See, and I think the important thing

is actually not to be panicking.

A.J.

Good morning, Mr. President. Good

morning, Ms. Wade. I see everyone's

getting an early start today.

LEWIS

How do we exit Sydney from the

building and what do we say to the

press at that point?

ROBIN

We need a diversion.

SYDNEY

A diversion.

ROBIN

You understand that by diversion

I'm not saying we set the White

House on fire.

SHEPHERD

No, please, let's do.

LEWIS

Can I state very clearly that I

can't be party to anything illegal.

A.J.

Good for you, Lewis.

LEWIS

Say what you want, but it's always

the guy in my job that ends up doing

eighteen months in Danbury Minimum

Security Prison.

SHEPHERD

Rest easy, Lewis. We're not creating

a diversion.

ROBIN

No diversion.

SHEPHERD

(to SYDNEY)

We'll have somebody take you home.

A.J.

Esther's over in my office. She's

got the station wagon outside.

LEWIS

Okay. Good. Now, the press

statement.

SHEPHERD

(to SYDNEY)

Sydney, when you leave here, you're

gonna run into reporters and

photographers. Your picture's gonna

be taken every day, and you're gonna

be asked questions every day. Answer

them, don't answer them -- it's

entirely up to you. The White House

has no official position except to

say "no comment."

ROBIN

No comment?

SHEPHERD

The White House doesn't comment on

the President's personal life.

LEWIS

We can't just leave it at that, sir.

SHEPHERD

I tell you what, Lewis, we just did.

LEWIS

But, sir...

A.J.

(the meeting's over)

Thank you, Mr. President.

A.J.

(continuing)

Sydney. Esther'll be in my office.

You take your time.

SYDNEY

Thanks, A.J.

SHEPHERD

I'm sorry about all this. We'll do

it better next time.

SYDNEY

I'm no expert, but I thought we did

it pretty good this time.

SHEPHERD

No, I mean...

SYDNEY

I know. I had a good time.

SHEPHERD

Me, too. I'll call you. I'll be in

Panama, but I'll call you.

SYDNEY

I'd like that.

SYDNEY

(continuing)

Bye.

SHEPHERD

All right...okay...this is good.

that someone I didn't know 13 years

ago, when I wasn't President,

participated in a demonstration where

no laws were being broken in protest

of something that so many people were

against it doesn't exist anymore?

(beat)

Just out of curiosity, what was the

fourth story?

LEWIS

See, I think it's important, when we

deal with it, that we--

SHEPHERD

Don't deal with it.

LEWIS

Excuse me?

SHEPHERD

They're trying to get us to swing at

a pitch in the dirt. No one ever

wins these fights. It'll go away.

LEWIS

I'm not sure that's the wisest--

SHEPHERD

Aw...hell!

ROBIN

See, it's already distracting you.

Why don't you let A.J. and Lewis--

SHEPHERD

No, you reminded me, I'm supposed to

have dinner with Sydney tonight.

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

It's terrific, Beth. I love it.

BETH

I can't believe I'm loaning you

clothes. I thought you owned every

piece of clothing there was.

SYDNEY

Work clothes. I always have dinner

at the White House wearing a suit.

I thought a dress would be nice.

BETH

Go ahead, try it on. I brought

earrings, too.

SYDNEY

(into phone)

Hello...

(listens)

I'm just trying on dresses. How do

you feel about leather?

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

I feel terrible, but I have to

cancel our date tonight.

SYDNEY

Another woman?

SHEPHERD

No, I've gotta go to St. Louis and

avert a massive airline strike.

SYDNEY

Boys, if I had a nickel for every

time I heard that one.

SHEPHERD

Thanks for understanding. I'll call

you tonight

SHEPHERD

Boy, I hate doing that. She was

trying on dresses.

LEWIS

I tell any girl I'm going out with to

assume that all plans are soft until

she receives confirmation 30 minutes

beforehand.

ROBIN

And they find this romantic?

LEWIS

Well, I say it with a great deal of

charm.

SHEPHERD

Look! Look! There it is! Carmen's

House of Flowers! We gotta stop.

LEWIS

What?

SHEPHERD

I gotta get her flowers.

LEWIS

Here?!

ROBIN

Now?!

SHEPHERD

I broke our date. This is what men

do.

ROBIN

It's not what men do. I know no men

who do that.

SHEPHERD

Coop, I'm gonna hop out at that

flower shop.

AGENT COOPER

You're gonna hop out, sir?

LEWIS

No, he's not hopping. Sir, no

hopping. Stay in the car. I'll get

the flowers.

SHEPHERD

Then it's not personal.

LEWIS

Let the agents do a security sweep.

We don't know who's in there.

SHEPHERD

You think there's a florist who's

planning an assassination on the

off-chance that I'd be stopping by?

LEWIS

It's possible.

CUT TO:

GIRL

(into phone)

At the basketball game...

SHEPHERD

Excuse me--

GIRL

No, at the game. I'm telling you,

Kiki wasn't even there.

SHEPHERD

Excuse me--

GIRL

(to Shepherd)

I will be right with you.

SHEPHERD

(to the GIRL)

Hey, I don't know if you're the

one I talked to on the phone...

Virginia, dogwood, the President

...any of it ring a--

SHEPHERD

Same girl. She remembers me.

AGENT COOPER

She'll be fine.

RUMSON (V.O.)

Yes, and I'm glad to see ol'

CUT TO:

RUMSON

(continuing)

Never mind she's the hired gun of

an ultra-liberal political action

committee.

RUMSON

(continuing)

Never mind that the President takes

the Fifth anytime a reporter has the

temerity to ask a question about a

woman in a position to exert enormous

influence over a huge range of issues.

RUMSON

(continuing)

Never mind that this woman's idea of

how to unwind at the end of a tough

day is by getting together with her

ACLU pals and setting American flags

on fire...

CUT TO:

ROBIN

(to herself)

No reaction from the White House.

SYDNEY

(into phone)

What do Lewis and Robin think?

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

Brutus and Cassius? They want me to

get into the character debate and mix

it up.

SYDNEY

(into phone)

Lewis and Robin are very smart.

SHEPHERD

(to LEWIS and ROBIN)

Sydney says you guys are really

stupid.

SYDNEY

(shouting through

the phone)

I didn't say that!

SHEPHERD

(to LEWIS and ROBIN)

She's questioning your loyalty.

LEWIS

Hell, I question it all the time.

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

Wait a second, here comes my favorite

part.

RUMSON (V.O.)

My name is Bob Rumson, and I'm running

for President.

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

It's a good thing he cleared that up,

'cause the crowd was gettin' ready

to buy some AMWAY products.

SYDNEY

(into phone)

His number are climbing.

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

Sydney, his number have nowhere to

go but up.

SYDNEY

(into phone)

What about yours?

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

We're fine. We'll be back up in the

60's once I get the votes for the

crime bill.

(beat; into phone)

Say, what're you doing this weekend?

SYDNEY

(into phone)

I've got some work I was gonna bring

home. Why?

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

The negotiations are going pretty

well here. It looks like the

nation's going to keep on flying.

Lucy's sleeping over at a friend's

house Saturday night.

SYDNEY

(into phone)

What'd you have in mind?

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

Have you ever been to Camp David?

SYDNEY

(into phone)

Camp David? Sure. I used to go

there all the time, but then they

changed chefs and...

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

It's sass, right? You're sassing

me.

SYDNEY

(into phone)

Yes.

SHEPHERD

(into phone)

I'll have a car pick you up Saturday

morning.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

SYDNEY

Do you ever get used to helicopters

dropping you off at your front door?

SHEPHERD

How many "e"s in "kaleidoscope"?

SYDNEY

I guess you do.

DISSOLVE TO:

SYDNEY

Oh good God.

SHEPHERD

What?

SYDNEY

I'm looking at your college

transcripts. This isn't human.

Nobody gets this many "A's." You

were like a Stepford student.

SHEPHERD

Are you still reading that ridiculous

biography?

SYDNEY

Actually I finished Andrew Shepherd:

Road to the White House. Now I'm onto

Shepherd: The Early Years.

SHEPHERD

Seven-trillion-dollar communications

system at my disposal, you'd think

I'd be able to find out if the

Packers won.

SYDNEY

(re the book)

Oh, Andy...C-minus in Women's

Studies?

SHEPHERD

Yeah...that course wasn't about what

I thought it was gonna be about.

NEWS ANCHOR #!

(on T.V.)

...for his routine physical exam.

Doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital

pronounced President Shepherd in

excellent health.

SHEPHERD

Who cares? Let's see some scores.

NEWS ANCHOR #2

(on T.V.)

While the President spent the day at

Camp David, G.O.P. presidential

hopeful Robert Rumson continued his

attacks on President Shepherd's

character. During the Saturday

morning news program Capitol

Review with Kenneth Michaels,

Senator Rumson suggested that GDC

political director Sydney Ellen Wade,

whose personal relationship with the

President has been causing the White

House headaches over the past two

months, may have traded sexual favors

for key votes in the Virginia State

Legislature while lobbying for the

Virginia Teachers Association.

MICHAELS

(on T.V.)

Wait a minute, Senator--

RUMSON

(on T.V.)

I'm not saying--

MICHAELS

(on T.V.)

--'cause that's a heck of an

accusation to make, and--

RUMSON

(on T.V.)

I'm not making an acc-- let me be

very clear. I'm not making an accusation.

I am saying when we hear one thing,

we dismiss it. We hear two, we dismiss it.

But when several, several well-

respected members and former members of

the Virginia State House--

MICHAELS

(on T.V.)

Can you give us names?

RUMSON

(on T.V.)

--each of their own accord, comes to

me and expresses concern over the

woman standing next to -- I don't even

know, do we call her the First Mistress?

When several--

SYDNEY

My God. He's making this up as he

goes along.

SHEPHERD

I'm so sorry about this, Sydney.

SYDNEY

Oh, man. My father heard that.

SHEPHERD

You gotta tell him to turn a deaf ear.

SYDNEY

My father doesn't have a deaf ear.

He hears fine out of both. So do I.

So does my sister, so do my friends.

You're the only one who seems to--

SHEPHERD

Sydney, I can't challenge the school

bully to a fight just because he

picked on my girlfriend.

SYDNEY

I'm not asking you to. I can take

care of myself. This isn't about me.

How can you keep quiet? How do you

have patience for people who claim

they love America but clearly can't

stand Americans?

SHEPHERD

I have one more election left, Sydney.

I don't have the luxury of losing my

patience.

SYDNEY

I want to say something, but I'm

gonna fumble it a little bit, so I'd

just like you to wait till I'm done

before you respond. I'm in love with

you. I'm certain of it. And I want to

be with you more than anything. But

maybe things would be better for you

if I disappeared for a while.

SHEPHERD

Things will be better when I pass a

crime bill. And Sydney, if you

disappeared, I'd find you.

DISSOLVE TO:

CUT TO:

GREEN BLAZERED MAN (GILL)

Mr. President, militant women are out

to destroy college football in this

country.

SHEPHERD

Is that a fact?

GREEN BLAZERED MAN (GILL)

Have you been following this

situation down in Atlanta? These

women want parity for girls'

softball, field hockey, volleyball...

SHEPHERD

If I'm not mistaken, Gill, I think

the courts ruled on Title 9 about 20

years ago.

GREEN BLAZERED MAN (GILL)

Yes sir, but now I'm saying these

women want that law enforced.

SHEPHERD

Well, it's a world gone mad, Gill.

KODAK

The country has mood swings.

LEWIS

Mood swings? Nineteen post-graduate

degrees in mathematics and you

explain going from a 63 to a 46

percent approval rating in 5 weeks

on mood swings?

KODAK

Well, I could explain it better, but

I'd need charts and graphs and an easel.

ROBIN

Fellas, we haven't slept in three

years. Can't we forget work for one

night and take this moment to enjoy

each other as friends? It's

Christmas.

LEWIS

(pause)

It's Christmas?

KODAK

Yeah, you didn't get the memo?

KID #1

'Cause your father's President, does

he automatically get to be on money?

LUCY

I honestly don't know.

KID #2

I think only if he's a really good

President.

A.J.

Hey, Sydney, Merry Christmas.

SYDNEY

Merry Christmas, A.J.

A.J.

Where you been?

SYDNEY

I got stuck on DePont Circle. I can

never remember which lane I'm

supposed to take. Then I got cut off

by this idiot cab driver who starts

screaming at me like it's my fault.

A.J.

Syd, relax. It's Christmas.

SHEPHERD

Hi, Syd. Get stuck on DuPont Circle

again?

SYDNEY

It's not funny. I hate that place.

Can't you declare it a Federal

Disaster Area or something?

SHEPHERD

I'll look into it.

A.J.

What were you doing up on the Hill,

anyway?

SYDNEY

Ahhh...I had a terrible meeting

today. Totally lost my cool with

McSorley, McCluskey and Shane.

SHEPHERD

You went to see the Motown Three?

SYDNEY

I pitched 'em the hill.

A.J.

(beat)

On its merits?

SHEPHERD

The woman knows no fear. She'd lobby

the Carolinas to the American Lung

Association.

SYDNEY

It was a disaster.

A.J.

You're in good company. I sat with

'em a week ago. They told me there

was nothing on the President's

domestic agenda they were more

committed to defeating than the crime

bill.

SYDNEY

Well, congratulations, fellas, you're

outta the cellar. McSorley told me

the only thing on the President's

domestic agenda they were more

committed to defeating than the crime

bill was the fossil fuel package.

A.J.

You're kidding, right?

SYDNEY

No, I'm not kidding. It's funny that

he used the same words.

A.J.

Yeah...

SHEPHERD

I don't think the Pep Boys know too

many words.

SYDNEY

I'm gonna get a drink and shake this

off. When I come back, I'll have

Christmas spirit.

SHEPHERD

(beat)

Okay.

SYDNEY

Is something wrong?

SHEPHERD

No, I was...I was thinking about--

nothing.

SYDNEY

I'll be back in a minute.

A.J.

Did what I think just happened, just

happen? Did the GDC's political

director just tell the President and

the White House Chief of Staff that

there are three votes on the crime

bill that can be bought by stickin'

the fossil fuel package in a drawer.

SHEPHERD

No, the GDC's political director

didn't tell us anything. Sydney Wade

told her boyfriend and her

boyfriend's best friend that she had

a lousy day.

A.J.

It doesn't change the facts, Mr.

President. If Sydney gets her 24

votes and we're three short, there's

some maneuvering to be done.

SHEPHERD

I made a promise, A.J.

A.J.

You made a deal, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

I made it with Sydney.

A.J.

You made it with the GDC.

SHEPHERD

Yeah, well, this is all academic

anyway. We're not going to need

those votes.

A.J.

If your approval rating drops any

more, things are gonna get tight.

I'm hearing rumors that your boss

is wavering on the crime bill.

That's what I wanted to hear.

AIDE

I'll tell you, though. My boss is

starting to waver on the crime bill.

CONGRESSMAN (PENNYBAKER)

Sydney, everybody cares about the

environment during a phone survey.

On election day, nobody gives a

damn. That's, that's why you have

a job.

SYDNEY

Congressman Pennybaker, on election

day, people give a damn about what I

tell them to give a damn about. And

that's why I have a job.

(offering the bread

basket)

Did you want another roll?

DAVID

She got Pennybaker.

VOICE

All right! Good job!

DISSOLVE TO:

Congressman, it was our understanding

that we had your support.

does the woman have to spend the

night?

DISSOLVE TO:

SYDNEY

(into phone)

We've got the full backing of

the White House, Katherine.

(listens)

Yes, at 20 percent. Three more votes

and the President sends it to the

Hill.

Katie, 10 years from now any cars

item. Come on board, we'll make your

Volvo a classic.

LEWIS

Congressman, the assault weapons

are gone.

KODAK

The bill is priced to move, see.

CONGRESSMAN

The bill isn't the issue, fellas.

I'm facing a serious challenge in

November, and the President's

coattails aren't what they used

to be.

KODAK

The President's coattail's are gonna

have room for you, Congressman, you

leave that to us.

AIDE

We left that to you people, Leon,

KODAK

I wouldn't say he's in a free--

CONGRESSMAN

I just can't give you my vote.

DISSOLVE TO:

LEWIS

The well is drying up. The

President's gotta make a move or

we're gonna die fast and quiet.

KODAK

What if I do a new poll? We give

him detailed public opinion.

LEWIS

And we put Sydney in the new model?

LEWIS

(continuing)

A.J., it's meaningless unless we ask

him about Sydney.

A.J.

Fine. Do it.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

This was delicious. Thank you. Is

there any left?

SYDNEY

(taking his bowl)

Tons. I didn't think you liked it.

SHEPHERD

Are you kidding me, of course I did.

But actually it's not for me. The

agent who checked the food thought

it was delicious, and I sort of told

him I'd bring him some if there was

any left.

SYDNEY

So you didn't like it.

SHEPHERD

No, I loved it.

SYDNEY

You're lying.

SHEPHERD

No, I'm not.

SYDNEY

You are. I can tell when you're

holding something back. You do a

thing with your face.

SHEPHERD

When have you seen me do a thing

with my face?

SYDNEY

Two days before I met you. You

gave a speech for the Daughters

of the American Revolution. I was

there.

SHEPHERD

You were?

SYDNEY

You remember the speech?

SHEPHERD

Vaguely.

SYDNEY

"American can no longer afford to

pretend that they live in a great

society."

SHEPHERD

Ah.

SYDNEY

There was supposed to be something

else after that, wasn't there?

SHEPHERD

How did you know?

SYDNEY

I told you. The face.

SHEPHERD

Wow...what's the occasion?

SYDNEY

You're looking at a lady who's two

votes shy of the promised land.

SHEPHERD

Two votes?

SYDNEY

I got Pennybaker. That got me Cass

and Zimmer.

SHEPHERD

That's great, Sydney. I mean it.

That's great work.

SYDNEY

Well, I'm not there yet.

SHEPHERD

Look, no matter what happens, you

yourself.

SYDNEY

I'll be proud when I see you sign

Yeah, well...

You're doing that thing with your face.

Bad.

ROBIN

How bad?

Forty-one. Character across the

KODAK

Jarrett. He's trying to keep his

finger in the dam.

LEWIS

You're supposed to be a United States

Congressman, for the love of Christ.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Hey, George? Can I tell you

something? We're gonna win this

thing. We're gonna get the votes

and we're gonna win. And after we

do, I mean that very night, I'm

gonna go to Sam & Harry's, I'm gonna

order a big steak, and I'm gonna make

a list of everybody who tried to fuck

us this week.

ROBIN

Lewis!

Vote your conscience, you chicken-

shit, lame-ass--

LEWIS

We lost Jarrett.

KODAK

I hope so. 'Cause, you know, if

that was an "undecided," then we

need to work on our people skills.

LEWIS

Karen, it's Lewis. Could you hunt

down Congressman Quincy for me. I

need to talk to him right way.

CUT TO:

A.J.

We lost Quincy, too.

SHEPHERD

Did he give a reason?

LEWIS

He thinks your numbers aren't likely

to rebound.

KODAK

We're three votes down again, sir.

KODAK

(continuing)

Mr. President, as of this morning,

Sydney only needed one more vote.

The Motown Three have gotta be

scared blind. I don't think there'll

be a better opportunity.

ROBIN

The press is expecting an

announcement on the crime bill by

the Sate of the Union.

KODAK

If you agree to stick 455 in a drawer

until after the elections, they'll

give you the three votes.

ROBIN

(beat)

And we declare victory, sir.

SHEPHERD

We said as a last resort.

KODAK

We're there, sir. The State of the

Union is 48 hours away.

SHEPHERD

No. Come on. There's gotta be three

votes someplace else.

KODAK

There isn't.

SHEPHERD

Bullshit, Leon. There's gotta be

somebody we haven't--

KODAK

There isn't, sir.

SHEPHERD

Storch.

KODAK

I beg your pardon?

SHEPHERD

What about Storch?

A.J.

Mr. President--

KODAK

Storch is a "no."

SHEPHERD

Wagner.

KODAK

No.

SHEPHERD

Sobel.

KODAK

No.

SHEPHERD

Clark.

KODAK

No.

SHEPHERD

Not that Clark, the one from

Indiana.

KODAK

(pause)

That one too, sir.

A.J.

Mr. President, I think we have to

do it.

SHEPHERD

She is one vote away, A.J. It's

important legislation that for the

first time has a legitimate chance.

I think she deserves every possible

opportunity to--

LEWIS

She? You meant "it," didn't you,

sir? You meant the "important

legislation" deserves every

opportunity.

A.J.

Lewis, shut up.

SHEPHERD

You got something to say to me?

LEWIS

Respectfully, sir. I think we should

examine the new poll for more than

its value as a box score.

SHEPHERD

Examine what? They don't like that

I'm going out with Sydney.

LEWIS

It's not that simple, sir. I think

this poll helps bribg a murky problem

into specific relief.

SHEPHERD

Whose problem we talking about,

Lewis? Yours? You worried about

your job? This poll isn't talking

about my Presidency. This poll is

talking about my life. Two hundred

and sixty-four million people have

decided--

LEWIS

Mr. President, two hundred and sixty-

four million people don't give a damn

about your life. They give a damn about

their own.

A.J.

All right, that's enough.

LEWIS

Mr. President, you've raised a

daughter almost entirely on your own,

and she's terrific. What does it say

to you that in the last seven weeks,

59 percent of this country has begun

to question your family values?

A.J.

The President doesn't answer to you,

Lewis.

LEWIS

Oh yes, he does, A.J.  I'm a citizen,

this is my president, and in this

country it is not only permissible to

question our leaders, it is our

responsibility. But you already know

that, Mr. President, because you have

a deeper love of this country than

any man I've ever known, and I want

to know what it says to you that in

the past seven weeks 59 percent of

Americans have begun to question your

patriotism?

SHEPHERD

Look, if people want to listen to Bob

Rumson--

LEWIS

They don't have a choice! Rob

Rumson's the only one doing the

talking. People want leadership.

And in the absence of genuine

leadership, they will listen to

anyone who steps up to the

microphone. They want leadership,

Mr. President. They're so thirsty

for it, they'll crawl through the

desert toward a mirage, and when

they discover there's no water,

they'll drink the sand.

SHEPHERD

(evenly)

Lewis, we've had Presidents who were

beloved, who couldn't find a coherent

sentence with two hands and a

flashlight. People don't drink the

sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis.

They drink it 'cause they don't know

the difference.

SHEPHERD

way out)

Make the deal.

CUT TO:

SUSAN

I want to go on the record and

apologize for my attitude toward you

since your arrival.

SYDNEY

I didn't notice. Was there an

attitude?

SUSAN

I think I have a lot of pent-up

hostility.

SYDNEY

Well--

SUSAN

I wonder who I can blame it on.

SYDNEY

I'm not really qualified to--

SUSAN

'Cause I've been blaming it on my

mother and my ex-husband, and that

hasn't been working.

DAVID

(approaching SYDNEY)

Leo needs to see you.

SYDNEY

Tell him to get over here. It's a

party.

DAVID

He needs to see you in his office.

SYDNEY

It can't wait?

DAVID

He just got off the phone with

MacInerney. There's been a

development.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

Sounds good.

LUCY

It's progressive.

SHEPHERD

I'll say.

LUCY

Hey, Dad, what's wrong with Sydney?

You guys have a fight?

SHEPHERD

(beat)

What do you mean?

LUCY

She seemed pretty--

SHEPHERD

You saw her?

LUCY

She's here.

SHEPHERD

Where?

LUCY

In your room. Why is she mad?

SHEPHERD

Don't worry about it.

LUCY

Were you a dork?

SHEPHERD

Practice your music.

LUCY

If you were a dork, you should say

you're sorry. Girls like that.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

(calling out)

Syd?

SYDNEY

Have you seen a gray cableknit

sweater?

SHEPHERD

A grey...sweater? No. I called

you at the office, but...

SYDNEY

It's Beth's. I wore it here one

time, and I didn't want to leave

it.

SHEPHERD

Where were you going?

SYDNEY

I'm going home, and then I'm going

to Hartford.

SHEPHERD

Connecticut?

SYDNEY

Yes. Do you know if it was sent with

your dry cleaning by any--

SHEPHERD

What's in Connecticut?

SYDNEY

Richard Reynolds' campaign. He may

be able to get me a job.

SHEPHERD

When did you decide to get a new job?

SYDNEY

Not long after Leo Solomon fired me

from my old one. Beth's gonna kill

me. She loves that--

SHEPHERD

Why did he fire you?

SYDNEY

Total failure to achieve any of the

objectives for which I was hired. I

told him he was being unreasonable.

After all, I did get to dance with

the President and ride in Air Force

One a couple of times. But you know

those prickly environmentalists.

It's always gonna be something with

them. If it's not clean air, then

it's clean water. Like it isn't good

enough that I'm on the cover of

People Magazine.

SHEPHERD

I'll call him.

SYDNEY

You'll call him? You mean you'll

call him yourself? Personally?

It'll come from the President?

That's a great idea. I think you

should call Leo and make a deal. He

hires me back for, say, 72 days. I

go around scaring the hell out of

Congress, making them think that the

President's about to drive through a

very damaging and costly bill.

They'll believe me, right, 'cause I'm

the President's Friday Night Girl.

Now I don't know if you can dip into

this well twice, especially since

I've lost all credibility in politics,

but you never know, I might just be

able to pull it off again. I might

be able to give you just the leverage

you need to pass some ground-breaking

piece of crime legislation -- like a

mandatory three-day waiting period

before a five-year-old can buy an Uzi.

Fuck the sweater -- she'll have to

learn to live with disappointment.

SHEPHERD

What do you think went on here today?

SYDNEY

I know exactly what went on here

today. I got screwed. You saw the

poll, you needed the crime bill,

you couldn't get it on your own,

so I got screwed.

SHEPHERD

The environment got screwed. Nothing

happened to you today, Sydney.

Governing is choosing. Governing is

prioritizing. I've made no secret of

the fact that the crime bill was my

top priority.

SYDNEY

Well then, congratulations. It's

only taken you three years to put

together crime prevention legislation

that has no hope of preventing crime.

SHEPHERD

(stopping)

Sydney. Please. I don't want to

lose you over this.

SYDNEY

Mr. President, you got bigger

problems than losing me. You just

lost my vote.

CUT TO:

A.J.

Hartfort? What's in Hartford?

SHEPHERD

Richard Reynolds' district office.

She's thinking of running his

campaign. Four in the corner.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Hartford. The insurance capital of

the world. Have a good time, Syd.

A.J.

Listen. I'm gonna have Janie clear

your schedule for the weekend. You

need to get some rest.

SHEPHERD

You handling me, A.J.?

A.J.

No, sir.

SHEPHERD

Good. 14 in the side.

A.J.

But I sure as hell will if you don't

start gettin' your head outta your ass.

SHEPHERD

Excuse me.

A.J.

Lewis is right. Go after this guy.

SHEPHERD

Has he lied?!

A.J.

What?

SHEPHERD

Has Rumson lied in the last seven

weeks?

A.J.

Has he lied?

SHEPHERD

Other than not knowing the difference

between Harvard and Stanford, has he

said something that isn't true? Am

I not a Commander-in-Chief who's

never served in the military? Am I

not opposed to a Constitutional

amendment banning flag burning? Am

I not an unmarried father who was

sharing a bed with a liberal lobbyist

down the hall from my twelve-year-old

daughter?

A.J.

And you think you're wrong?

SHEPHERD

I don't think you win elections by

telling 59 percent of the people that

they are.

A.J.

We fight the fights we can win.

SHEPHERD

Don't--

A.J.

You fight the fights that need

fighting!

SHEPHERD

Is the view pretty good from the

cheap seats, A.J.?

A.J.

I beg your pardon.

SHEPHERD

It occurs to me that in 25 years I've

never seen your name on a ballot.

Why have you always been standing a

pace behind me?

A.J.

Because if I hadn't been, you'd be

the most popular history professor

at the University of Wisconsin.

SHEPHERD

Fuck you.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Have Lewis put the final drafts of

the State of the Union and the Crime

Bill announcement on my desk in the

morning.

A.J.

Yes, sir.

SHEPHERD

If Mary hadn't died...would we have

won three years ago?

A.J.

Would we have won?

SHEPHERD

If we'd had to go through a character

debate three years ago, would we have

won?

A.J.

I don't know. But I would've liked

that campaign. If my friend Andy

Shepherd had shown up, I would have

liked that campaign.

SHEPHERD

(pause)

Yeah.

CUT TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

SHEPHERD

You're not hungry?

LUCY

This is oatmeal.

SHEPHERD

Yeah.

LUCY

We never have oatmeal.

SHEPHERD

It's good for you.

LUCY

I'm from Wisconsin. I need food.

SHEPHERD

You're not from Wisconsin. I'm from

Wisconsin. You've lived in

Washington your whole life.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

How are you doing in your

Constitutional debates?

LUCY

We're done.

SHEPHERD

You're done?

LUCY

We ratified it last week.

SHEPHERD

Oh...well...that's good. Why didn't

you tell me?

LUCY

It's not a big deal, Dad.

SHEPHERD

Okay, I give up. I don't care why

you're not happy in social studies.

I care about why you're not talking

to me about why you're not happy in

social studies.

LUCY

Dad, I'm perfectly--

SHEPHERD

You're not perfectly happy. You

don't think I know when something's

bothering you?

LUCY

Damnit, Dad!

SHEPHERD

Hey!

LUCY

You know--

SHEPHERD

Talk to me.

LUCY

Look--

LUCY

(continuing)

--sometimes when you talk, you say

things I disagree with.

SHEPHERD

Almost every time I talk, I say

things you disagree with.

LUCY

I mean politically.

SHEPHERD

(pause)

Politically?

LUCY

Yes.

SHEPHERD

(pause)

What do you mean?

LUCY

Yes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean,

I'm not sure. You know a lot more

than I do -- but still, I have these

feelings, and I don't think they're

wrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm

not so sure it's all right to burn a

flag. I mean, it really bothers a lot

of people, and I don't know why you

think it's okay. I hear Senator

Rumson talk, and some of the things

he says sounds right to me, and I

think, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?!

I mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad

hates this guy!

Why am I agreeing with him" And then

I think, "Well, maybe I'm not really

like Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not

like Dad either." But the point is

I'm the President's kid, and people

pay attention to what I say, and if

I say something different from what

you say, it'll be embarrassing for

you. So I can't just get up in social

studies class and say whatever I want.

SHEPHERD

(quietly)

Stand up please.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

I want you to pay very close

attention to what happens now.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

In your  lifetime, you will never

embarrass me. It could never happen.

You're not the President's daughter,

Lucy, you're mine.

And no one's gonna vote me out of

that job. You're my daughter, and

everything else is a distant second.

(more)

School is for you, Lucy. You say

what you want. The only thing you

have to do to make me happy is

come home at the end of the day.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

One more thing. I don't dislike

Senator Rumson because of his

political views. And even if you

voted for everything he would vote

for, that wouldn't make you like him.

There's a fundamental difference

the world.

LUCY

What's that?

SHEPHERD

The difference is that he says he

loves America. Saying you love

America is easy. What takes

character -- and this is what you

have--

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

What takes character is loving

Americans.

(beat)

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Luce, I gotta go.

LUCY

Dad, is everything all right?

SHEPHERD

Everything's fine. I'm just a little

late for work.

SHEPHERD

Somebody get my daughter some food!

The girl's from Wisconsin, for cryin'

out loud!

CUT TO:

REPORTER #4

Robin, will the President ever

respond to Senator Rumson's

question about being a member of

the American Civil Liberties Union?

SHEPHERD

Yes, he will. 'Morning.

ROBIN

Good morning, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

That's all right, you can keep your

seats. For the last couple of

months, Senator Rumson has suggested

that being president of this country

was, to a certain extent, about

character...

ROBIN

(into phone)

Lewis...call A.J. and come on down

here...I don't know, but

something's happening.

SHEPHERD

...and although I have not been

willing to engage in his attacks on

me, I've been here three years and

three days, and I can tell you

without hesitation: Being President

of this country is entirely about

character.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

For the record: Yes, I am a card-

carrying member of the A.C.L.U. But

the more important question is why

aren't you, Bob? This is an

organization whose sole purpose is to

defend the Bill of Rights, so it

naturally begs the questions.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Why would a senator, his party's most

powerful spokesman and a candidate

for president, choose to reject

upholding the Constitution? If you

can answer that question, then,

folks, you're smarter than I am,

because I didn't understand it until

a couple of minutes ago. Everybody

knows American isn't easy. America is

advanced citizenship.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's

gonna put up a fight. It's gonna

say, "You want free speech? Let's

see you acknowledge a man whose words

make your blood boil, who's standing

center stage and advocating, at the

top of his lungs, that which you

would spend a lifetime opposing at the

top of yours. You want to claim

this land as the land of the free,

then the symbol of your country can't

just be a flag; the symbol also has

to be one of its citizens exercising

his right to burn that flag in

protest." Show me that, defend that,

celebrate that in your classrooms.

Then you can stand up and sing about

the land of the free. I've known Bob

Rumson for years. I've been operating

under the assumption that the reason

Bob devotes so much time and energy to

shouting at the rain was that he simply

didn't get it. Well, I was wrong.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't

get it. Bob's problem is that he

can't sell it. Nobody has ever won

an election by talking about what I

was just talking about.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

This is a country made up of people

with hard jobs that they're terrified

of losing. The roots of freedom are

of little or no interest to them at

the moment. We are a nation afraid

to go out at night. We're a society

that has assigned low priority to

education and has looked the other

way while our public schools have

been decimated. We have serious

problems to solve, and we need

serious men to solve them. And

whatever your particular problem is,

friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is

not the least bit interested in

solving it. He is interested in two

things and two things only: Making

you afraid of it and telling you

who's to blame for it. That, ladies

and gentlemen, is how you win

elections. You gather a group of

middle-aged, middle-class, middle-

income voters who remember with

longing an easier time, and you talk

to them about family and American

values and personal character. Then

you have an old photo of the

President's girlfriend. You scream

about patriotism and you tell them

she's to blame for their lot in life,

you go on television and you call her

a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done

nothing to you, Bob. She has done

nothing but put herself through law

school, prosecute criminals for five

years, represent the interests of

public school teachers for two years,

and lobby for the safety of our

natural resources.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

You want a character debate? Fine,

but you better stick with me, 'cause

Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your

league. I've loved two women in my

life. I lost one to cancer, and I

lost the other 'cause I was so busy

keeping my job I forgot to do my job.

Well that ends right now.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Tomorrow morning the White House is

sending a bill to Congress for its

consideration. It's White House

Resolution 455, an energy bill

requiring a 20 percent reduction of the

emission of fossil fuels over the

next ten years. It is by far the

most aggressive stride ever taken in

the fight to reverse the effects of

global warming. The other piece of

legislation is the crime bill. As of

today it no longer exists. I'm

throwing it out. I'm throwing it out

and writing a law that makes sense.

You cannot address crime prevention

without getting rid of assault

weapons and handguns.

I consider them a threat to national

security, and I will go door to door

if I have to, but I'm gonna convince

Americans that I'm right, and I'm

gonna get the guns. We've got

serous problems, and we need serious

men, and if you want to talk about

character, Bob, you'd better come at

me with more than a burning flag and

a membership card. If you want to

talk about character and American

values, fine. Just tell me where and

when, and I'll show up. This is a

time for serious men, Bob, and your

fifteen minutes are up. My name's

Andrew Shepherd, and I am the

President.

ROBIN

Any questions?

CUT TO:

A.J.

Well, you don't see that every day

of the week.

LEWIS

He's got the whole White House Press

Corps asking each other how to spell

"erudite."

A.J.

Lewis, call the printer.

LEWIS

I know. Gotta rewrite the State of

the Union.

A.J.

Every word, Lewis. It's a whole new

ball game. You've got 35 minutes.

LEWIS

Oh, good. I thought I was gonna be rushed.

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

I don't want the limo. I don't want

an escort.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

I want a plain, ordinary, non-

bullet-proof automobile. Someone

around here must have a Chevy I

can borrow. Well, find one and

meet me outside the West Wing

entrance in five minutes.

A.J.

Where are you going?

SHEPHERD

I'm going to her house. I'm gonna

stand at her front door till she

lets me in. And I'm not leaving till

I get her back.

A.J.

How're you gonna do that?

SHEPHERD

I haven't worked that out yet. But

I'm sure groveling will be involved.

A.J.

You're just gonna drive over?

SHEPHERD

I'm the Commander-in-Chief of the

most powerful army in the world.

You don't think I can drive ten blocks?

SYDNEY

Just stay away from DuPont Circle.

I hear it's murder this time of day.

SYDNEY

Hi, A.J.

A.J.

It's nice to see you, Ms. Wade. If

anybody needs me, I'll be in the

Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.

SYDNEY

I heard your speech. I was in my

car, and it just kind of steered

its way over here.

SHEPHERD

I'm glad.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Sydney, I didn't decide to send

455 to the floor to get you back.

SYDNEY

I didn't come back 'cause you decided

to send 455 to the floor.

LEWIS

(entering)

Mr. President, I thought you might

want to look at this. I moved Social

Security up front. Hello, Sydney.

JANIE

Mr. President, Leventhal at

Treasury wants two minutes. Hello,

Sydney.

MRS. CHAPIL

Mr. President -- Excuse me, Miss

Wade -- Miss McCall is on her way

over.

SHEPHERD

I've got some things to do.

SYDNEY

Yes, you do.

ANCHOR (V.O.)

We're only a moment or two away from

the arrival of President Shepherd and

his State of the Union address.

Lloyd, you've served on the staffs of

several past administrations, what

kind of last-minute activity is the

President engaged in right now?

CUT TO:

SHEPHERD

I'm having a cuff links crisis.

SHEPHERD

(continuing; to LUCY)

I think they've locked.

LUCY

Hold still.

ROBIN

Mr. President, they're waiting for

you.

LUCY

All done.

SHEPHERD

Lewis.

LEWIS

Sir.

SHEPHERD

Things have been a little rough

between us lately.

LEWIS

I know sir, I'm sorry.

SHEPHERD

Don't stop what you're doing.

LEWIS

That's kind of you, sir, but I

realize I've been a little

insensitive about some personal...

SHEPHERD

No, you were right. Two hundred and

sixty-four million people don't give

a damn about my life.

LEWIS

Just so you know I've never been one

of them, Mr. President.

ROBIN

This way, people. Let's go.

SHEPHERD

(to LEWIS)

See you after.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

Whatcha got there, Luce?

LUCY

Article 2, Section 3, of the U.S.

Constitution. Executive Powers.

(reading)

"He shall, from time to time, give to

the Congress information of the State

of the Union, and recommend to their

consideration such measures as he

shall judge necessary and expedient."

A.J.

Sounds right up your alley.

A.J.

(continuing)

Give 'em hell, Andy.

A.J.

(continuing)

You've got 30 seconds, Mr. President.

SHEPHERD

Thank you.

(to LUCY)

I'll see you afterward. I want a

critique.

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

There's been something I've been

trying to give you since our first

date. I tried a bunch of times, but

somehow I've always managed to trip

over my job.

Anyay...

SHEPHERD

(continuing)

These are for you.

SYDNEY

They're beautiful.

JANIE

Mr. President?

SHEPHERD

Gotta go.

SYDNEY

Should I stay here?

SHEPHERD

No, walk with me.

SYDNEY

How'd you finally do it?

SHEPHERD

(raising his voice

above the cheering)

Do what?

SYDNEY

Manage to give a woman flowers and

be President at the same time.

SHEPHERD

Well...it turns out I've got a rose

garden.

DOORKEEPER

Mr. Speaker!!!...THE PRESIDENT OF THE

UNITED STATES!!!
