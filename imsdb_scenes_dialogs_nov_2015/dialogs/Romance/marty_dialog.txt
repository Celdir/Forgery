MRS. FUSARI

Your kid brother got married last

Sunday, eh, Marty?

MARTY

(sawing away)

That's right, Missus Fusari. It was

a very nice affair.

MRS. FUSARI

That's the big tall one, the fellow

with the moustache.

MARTY

(still sawing)

No, that's my other brother, Freddie.

My other brother Freddie, he's been

married four years already. He lives

down on Webb Avenue. The one who got

married Sunday, that was my little

brother, Nickie.

MRS. FUSARI

I thought he was a big tall fat

fellow. Didn't I meet him here one

time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried

to sell me life insurance?

MARTY

No, that's my sister Margaret's

husband, Frank. My sister Margaret,

she's married to the insurance

salesman, and my sister Rose, she

married a contractor. They moved to

Detroit last year. And my other sister

Frances, she got married about two

and a half years ago in Saint John's

Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh,

that was a big affair. Well, let's

see now, that'll be about a dollar-

seventy-nine. How's that with you?

MRS. FUSARI

Well...

WOMAN'S VOICE

(off-screen)

Hey, Marty, I'm inna hurry.

MARTY

You're next right now, Missus Canduso.

MRS. FUSARI

When you gonna get married, Marty?

You should be ashamed of yourself.

All your brothers and sisters, they

all younger than you, they married

and they got children. I just saw

your mother inna fruit shop, and she

says to me, "Hey, you know a nice

girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter

with you? That's no way. Now you get

married.

MARTY

(amiably)

Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over

there, she's inna big hurry, and...

MRS. FUSARI

My son Frank, he was married when he

was nineteen years old. Watsa matter

with you?

MARTY

That's swell, Missus Fusari.

MRS. FUSARI

You should be ashamed of yourself.

MRS. CANDUSO

Marty, I want a nice, big fat pullet,

about four pounds. I hear your kid

brother got married last Sunday.

MARTY

Yeah, it was a very nice affair.

MRS. CANDUSO

Marty, you oughta be ashamed. All

your kid brothers and sisters married

and have children. When you gonna

get married?

MARTY

leaving)

YOUNG MAN

Seventy-First Street.

MARTY

(to Bartender)

Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...

RALPH

So, Marty, lemme tell you about these

nurses, Marty...

MARTY

(to Joe studying his

magazine)

Waddaya read there, Joe?

AD LIB VOICE

(off-screen)

Hey, Lou, turn the television off!

RALPH

Turns out these two girls are nurses

in some hospital on a Hundred and

Fourth Street...

JOE

They shouldn't sell magazines like

this on a public newsstand...

MARTY

That's the truth.

JOE

(turning a page)

Can you imagine the effect this has

on adolescents?

RALPH

So, Marty, let me tell you about

these nurses...

MARTY

(reaching for two

bottles of beer

proffered by the

Bartender)

What nurses?

RALPH

The nurses Leo and me picked up last

night. We got a date with them

tonight.

MARTY

(moving off to Angie's

booth)

You still owe me ten bucks from last

week, if that's what you're working

up to.

JOE

Now that's something, eh?

RALPH

I used to go out with a girl like

that...

THE KID

You should live so long.

ANGIE

(without looking up)

So waddaya feel like doing tonight?

MARTY

I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel

like doing?

ANGIE

Well, we oughta do something. It's

Saturday night. I don't wanna go

bowling like last Saturday. How about

calling up that big girl we picked

up inna movies about a month ago in

the RKO Chester?

MARTY

(not very interested)

Which one was that?

ANGIE

That big girl that was sitting in

front of us with the skinny friend.

MARTY

Oh, yeah.

ANGIE

We took them home alla way out in

Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney.

What do you say? You think I oughta

give her a ring? I'll take the skinny

one.

MARTY

She probably got a date by now, Angie.

ANGIE

Well, let's call her up. What can we

lose?

MARTY

I didn't like her, Angie. I don't

feel like calling her up.

ANGIE

Well, what do you feel like doing

tonight?

MARTY

I don't know. What do you feel like

doing?

ANGIE

Well, we're back to that, huh? I say

to you, "What do you feel like doing

tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't

know, what do you feel like doing?"

And then we wind up sitting around

your house with a coupla cansa beer,

watching Sid Caesar on television.

Well, I tell you what I feel like

doing. I feel like calling up this

Mary Feeney. She likes you.

MARTY

What makes you say that?

ANGIE

I could see she likes you.

MARTY

Yeah, sure.

ANGIE

(half-rising in his

seat)

I'll call her up.

MARTY

You call her up for yourself, Angie.

I don't feel like calling her up.

ANGIE

How about going downa Seventy-Second

Street, see what we can find? Ralph

says you have to beat them off with

clubs.

ANGIE

Boy, you're getting to be a real

drag, you know that?

MARTY

Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I

been looking for a girl every Saturday

night of my life. I'm tired of

looking. Everybody's always telling

me to get married. Get married. Get

married. Don't you think I wanna get

married? I wanna get married. They

drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna

wreck your Saturday night for you,

Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you

go ahead. I don't wanna go.

ANGIE

My old lady, every word outta her

mouth, when you gonna get married?

MARTY

My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.

ANGIE

So what do you feel like doing

tonight?

MARTY

(without looking up)

I don't know. What do you feel like

doing?

BARTENDER

(from phone booth in

background)

Marty, your mother wants you onna

phone.

MARTY

(rising in response;

to Angie)

Come on over about half past seven,

we'll think of something.

(settles into the

phone booth, picks

up the receiver)

Hello, Ma, what's the matter?

MRS. PILLETTI

(voice lowered)

Hello, Marty, when you coming home?

Where you now? Because your cousin

Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're

here. They had another fight with

your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...

MARTY

(in the phone booth)

I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll

be home in about two minutes. Tell

Thomas stick around, I wanna see him

about something.

MRS. PILLETTI

Okay, you come on home, okay.

MRS. PILLETTI

He coming home right now.

VIRGINIA

So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about

the milk bottle was my mother-in-

law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt

Theresa, and she begins poking her

head over my shoulder here and poking

her head over my shoulder there, so

then she begins telling me how I

waste money and how I can't cook,

and how I'm raising my baby all wrong,

so she got me so nervous, I spilled

some milk I was making for the baby...

MRS. PILLETTI

She was here, you know, Wednesday,

and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."

VIRGINIA

So she say, "You're spilling the

milk." So she kept talking about

these coupla drops of milk I spilled,

so she got me so mad, so I said,

"Mama, you wanna see me really spill

some milk?" So I took the bottle,

and I threw it against the door. I

didn't throw it at her. That's just

something she made up. She goes around

telling everybody I threw the bottla

milk at her. I didn't throw it

anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry

right away, you know, but she ran

outta the house.

MRS. PILLETTI

Well, I don't know what you want me

to do, Virginia. If you want me,

I'll go talk to her tonight.

THOMAS

Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...

VIRGINIA

Lemme tell it, Tommy.

THOMAS

Okay.

VIRGINIA

We want you to do a very big favor

for us, Aunt Theresa.

MRS. PILLETTI

Sure.

VIRGINIA

Aunt Theresa, you got this big house

here. I mean, you got this big house

just for you and Marty. And I thought

maybe Tommy's mother could come here

and live with you and Marty.

MRS. PILLETTI

Well...

VIRGINIA

Because I called up Tommy's brother

Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving

me crazy. Why don't you take her for

a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh

no!" I know I sound like a terrible

woman...

MRS. PILLETTI

No, Virginia, I know how you feel.

VIRGINIA

(on the verge of tears)

I just can't stand it any more! Every

minute of the day! Do this! Do that!

I don't have ten minutes privacy

with my husband! We can't even have

a fight! We don't have no privacy!

Everybody's miserable in our house!

THOMAS

All right, Ginnie, don't get so

excited.

MRS. PILLETTI

She's right. She's right. Young

husband and wife, they should have

their own home. And my sister

Catherine, she's my sister, but I

gotta admit, she's an old goat. And

plenty-a times in my life, I feel

like throwing the milk bottle at her

myself. And I tell you now, as far

as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa

come live here with me and Marty,

it's all right with me.

THOMAS

(not far from tears

himself, lowers his

face)

That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.

MRS. PILLETTI

We gotta ask Marty, of course.

THOMAS

Sure.

MRS. PILLETTI

(rises)

You just sit here, I gotta turn the

fire on under the cooking.

(exits into the kitchen)

VIRGINIA

(having mastered her

tears)

That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.

THOMAS

(calling to his aunt

in the kitchen)

How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?

MRS. PILLETTI

(off-screen)

Oh, he's fine. You know a nice girl

he can marry?

THOMAS

Oh, he'll get married, don't worry,

Aunt Theresa.

MRS. PILLETTI

(sitting down again)

Well, I don't know. He sits arounna

house alla time. You know a place he

can go where he can find a bride?

THOMAS

Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom.

That's a kind of a big dance hall.

Every Saturday night, it's just loaded

with girls. It's a nice place to go.

You pay seventy-seven cents. It used

to be seventy-seven cents. It must

be about a buck and half now. And

you go in and you ask some girl to

dance. That's how I met Virginia.

Nice, respectable place to meet girls.

You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you

tell him, "Go to the Stardust

Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."

MRS. PILLETTI

(committing the line

to memory)

The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded

with tomatoes.

THOMAS

Right.

VIRGINIA

This is very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa,

what you're doing for us, and don't

think we don't appreciate...

MRS. PILLETTI

He's here.

MARTY

Hello, Ma.

MRS. PILLETTI

(whispers)

Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here.

They had another fight with your

Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would

it be all right if Catherine come to

live with us. So I said, all right

with me, but we have to ask you.

Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody

wants her. Everybody's throwing her

outta their house...

MARTY

Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.

MRS. PILLETTI

You gotta good heart.

MRS. PILLETTI

He says okay, it's all right Catherine

comes here.

THOMAS

Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really

takes a load offa my mind.

MARTY

Oh, we got plenny-a room here.

MRS. PILLETTI

Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's

gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight

to your house, and I talk with

Catherine, and you see, everything

is gonna work out all right.

THOMAS

I just wanna thank you people again,

because the situation was just

becoming impossible.

MRS. PILLETTI

Siddown, Thomas, siddown.

VIRGINIA

I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...

MRS. PILLETTI

That's all right, that's all right...

VIRGINIA

On accounta...

MRS. PILLETTI

I'm gonna see you tonight...

THOMAS

Marty, I don't know how to tell you

how much I appreciate what you and

your mother are doing, because the

kinda thing was happening in our

house was Virginia was in the kitchen

making some milk for the baby. So my

mother comes in...

VIRGINIA

Tommy, I promised the babysitter six

o'clock.

MARTY

Tommy, before you go, I wonder if

you gimme a little advice.

THOMAS

Sure, what?

MARTY

You're the accountant inna family,

and I figure you might know about

these things. My boss wantsa sell

his shop to me. His kids are all

married, you know, and he and his

wife live alone, and they wanna move

out to California where his daughter

lives, so he wantsa sell his shop.

He wants five thousand dollars down,

although I think I can knock him

downa four...

VIRGINIA

(off-screen, from

deep in the kitchen)

Tommy!

THOMAS

(rises)

I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll

sit down and we'll discuss the whole

thing.

MARTY

All right, I'll see you, Thomas,

because he wants an answer by Monday.

THOMAS

Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother.

We'll work out some arrangement,

because naturally I want to pay...

MARTY

Don't worry about it.

THOMAS

No, listen, that's my mother, I'm

gonna pay for her...

VIRGINIA

(off-screen)

Goodby, Marty!

MARTY

Goodby, Virginia! See you soon!

MARTY

(with a vague pretense

at good diction)

Hello, is this Mary Feeney?... Could

I speak to Miss Mary Feeney?... Just

tell her an old friend...

MARTY

...Oh, hello there, is this Mary

Feeney? Hello there, this is Marty

Pilletti. I wonder if you recall

me... Well, I'm kind of a stocky

guy. The last time we met was in a

movie, the RKO Chester. You was with

another girl, and I was with a friend

of mine named Angie. This was about

a month ago...

MARTY

The RKO Chester in Westchester Square.

You was sitting in front of us, and

we was annoying you, and you got

mad, and... I'm the fellow who works

in a butcher shop... Come on, you

know who I am!... That's right, we

went to Howard Johnson's and we had

hamburgers. You hadda milkshake...

Yeah, that's right. I'm the stocky

one, the heavy-set feller... Well,

I'm glad you recall me, because I

hadda swell time that night, and I

was just wondering how everything

was with you. How's everything?...

That's swell... Yeah, well, I'll

tell you why I called...I was figuring

on taking in a movie tonight, and I

was wondering if you and your friend

would care to see a movie tonight

with me and my friend...

(his eyes are closed

now)

Yeah, tonight. I know it's pretty

late to call for a date, but I didn't

know myself, till... Yeah, I know,

well how about... Yeah, I know, well

maybe next Saturday night. You free

next Saturday night?... Well, how

about the Saturday after that?...

Yeah, I know... Yeah... Yeah... Oh,

I understand, I mean...

MRS. PILLETTI

So what are you gonna do tonight,

Marty?

MARTY

I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked

out. I may just hang arounna house.

MRS. PILLETTI

Why don't you go to the Stardust

Ballroom?

MARTY

What?

MRS. PILLETTI

I say, why don't you go to the

Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with

tomatoes.

MARTY

It's loaded with what?

MRS. PILLETTI

Tomatoes.

MARTY

Ha! Who told you about the Stardust

Ballroom?

MRS. PILLETTI

Thomas. He told me it was a very

nice place.

MARTY

Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance

hall, and that's all it is. I been

there a hundred times. Loaded with

tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.

MRS. PILLETTI

Marty, I don't want you hang arounna

house tonight. I want you to go take

a shave and go out and dance.

MARTY

Ma, when are you gonna give up? You

gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't

never gonna get married.

MRS. PILLETTI

You gonna get married.

MARTY

Sooner or later, there comes a point

in a man's life when he gotta face

some facts, and one fact I gotta

face is that whatever it is that

women like, I ain't got it. I chased

enough girls in my life. I went to

enough dances. I got hurt enough. I

don't wanna get hurt no more. I just

called a girl just now, and I got a

real brush-off, boy. I figured I was

past the point of being hurt, but

that hurt. Some stupid woman who I

didn't even wanna call up. She gave

me the brush. I don't wanna go to

the Stardust Ballroom because all

that ever happened to me there was

girls made me feel like I was a bug.

I got feelings, you know. I had enough

pain. No, thank you.

MRS. PILLETTI

Marty...

MARTY

Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch

Jackie Gleason.

MRS. PILLETTI

You gonna die without a son.

MARTY

So I'll die without a son.

MRS. PILLETTI

Put on your blue suit...

MARTY

Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a

fat man. A fat ugly man.

MRS. PILLETTI

You not ugly.

MARTY

(his voice rising)

I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!

MRS. PILLETTI

Marty...

MARTY

Ma! Leave me alone!

MARTY

Ma, waddaya want from me?! Waddaya

want from me?! I'm miserable enough

as it is! Leave me alone! I'll go to

the Stardust Ballroom! I'll put onna

blue suit and I'll go! And you know

what I'm gonna get for my trouble?

Heartache! A big night of heartache!

MARTY

Loaded with tomatoes...boy, that's

rich.

ANDY

(in a low voice)

I told you she wasn't especially

attractive, but that she had a good

deal of charm, and she's really a

real nice girl...

DR. KEEGAN

(extracting cigarettes

from the machine)

She's all right, Andy. It's just

that I get one Saturday night off

every three weeks, and I was expecting

something better, that's all.

ANDY

I told you she wasn't attractive...

DR. KEEGAN

You told me that she was a little

tall, but that she wasn't bad looking

at all.

ANDY

Millie's been after me to fix her up

with a date, so I...

DR. KEEGAN

All right, I'm having a fair time.

It's just that I get one Saturday

night off in three weeks, and I wanted

to wind up with something tonight.

DR. KEEGAN

Hey!

GIRL

Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!

DR. KEEGAN

I came up to dance, wadda you think?

You here with somebody?

GIRL

I'm just here with another girl.

DR. KEEGAN

Where you going now?

GIRL

I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I

left them in my coat.

DR. KEEGAN

I'll see you around.

GIRL

I'll see you.

DR. KEEGAN

That's a girl used to know.

ANDY

Boy, it's packed in here.

MILLIE

(to Clara)

Some of these kids are awful young.

Aren't you afraid you'll bump into

one of your students?

CLARA

(nervously looking at

Dr. Keegan)

I wouldn't think so. I teach out in

Brooklyn.

ANDY

You been up here before, Clara?

CLARA

Yeah, twice.

MILLIE

Shall we try to get a table and get

something to drink or shall we just

go in and start dancing?

ANDY

Hey, Herbie...

ANDY

(continues)

Hey, Herbie...

DR. KEEGAN

What?

ANDY

You wanna have a drink before we

start dancing?

DR. KEEGAN

Listen. You people go grab a table.

I'll be back inna minute. I'll be

right back.

ANDY

So what do you say, Clara? Wanna see

if we can get a table?

CLARA

All right.

ANGIE

Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?

MARTY

There was one nice-looking one there

inna black dress and beads, but she's

dancing now.

ANGIE

(looking off-screen)

There's a nice-looking little short

one for you right now.

MARTY

(following his gaze)

Where?

ANGIE

Down there. That little one there.

MARTY

Yeah, she looks all right from here.

ANGIE

Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask

them? I'll take the one inna green

dress.

MARTY

I think this number is a little fast.

Wait a minute.

MARTY

It's all right, I think. They still

there?

ANGIE

Waddaya say, you wanna dance?

MARTY

Excuse me, would you care for this

dance?

SHORT GIRL

(but not unpleasantly)

I don't feel like dancing just yet.

MARTY

Sure.

DR. KEEGAN

(off-screen)

You here stag or with a girl?

MARTY

You say something?

DR. KEEGAN

Yeah. I was just asking you if you

was here stag or with a girl.

MARTY

I'm stag.

DR. KEEGAN

Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on

a blind date with a dog, and I just

met an old girl I used to know, and

I was wondering how I'm gonna get

rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody

to take her home, you know what I

mean? I'd be glad to pay you five

bucks if you take her home for me.

MARTY

(confused)

What?

DR. KEEGAN

I'll take you over, and I'll introduce

you as an old army buddy of mine,

and then I'll cut out. Because I got

this other girl waiting for me out

by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you

five bucks.

MARTY

(stares at the man)

Are you kidding?

DR. KEEGAN

No, I'm not kidding.

MARTY

You can't just walk off onna girl

like that.

DR. KEEGAN

...in that case, as long as she's

going home alone, give me the five

bucks back...

STAG

Look, Mac, you paid me the five bucks.

I was willing. It's my five bucks...

MARTY

(finally)

Excuse me, Miss, would you care to

dance?

VIRGINIA

Hello, Aunt Theresa. Come in.

MRS. PILLETTI

(in a low voice as

she pulls off her

coat)

Is Catherine here?

VIRGINIA

(nods, keeping her

voice low)

We didn't tell her anything yet. We

thought that we'd leave it to you.

We thought you'd put it like how you

were lonely, and why don't she come

to live with you. Because that way

it looks like she's doing you a favor,

insteada we're throwing her out, and

it won't be so cruel on her. Do you

want Tommy and me to stay here with

you?

MRS. PILLETTI

I think it be a better idea if you

and Thomas go out, because otherwise

she's gonna start a fight with you,

and everybody's gonna be yelling.

THOMAS

Hello, Aunt Theresa.

MRS. PILLETTI

Hello, Thomas.

THOMAS

I just this minute got the baby to

sleep.

THOMAS

Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way

to ask her is you say that you're

very lonely, see? And wouldn't she

come and keep you company, because

that way, you see...

MRS. PILLETTI

Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a

the whole thing.

CATHERINE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

Who's there?! Who's there?!

MRS. PILLETTI

(calling back)

It's me, Catherine! How you feel?

CATHERINE

Hey! What are you doing here?

MRS. PILLETTI

I came to see you. How you feel?

CATHERINE

I gotta pain in my left side, and my

leg throbs like a drum.

MRS. PILLETTI

I been getting a pain in my shoulder.

CATHERINE

I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I

have a pain in my hip, and my right

arm aches so much I can't sleep.

It's a curse to be old. How you feel?

MRS. PILLETTI

I feel fine.

CATHERINE

That's nice.

MRS. PILLETTI

Well, how's everything with you?

MRS. PILLETTI

My son Marty's fine. Everybody's

fine...

MRS. PILLETTI

We gotta postcard from my son Nickie

and his bride. They're inna big hotel

in Florida on their honeymoon.

Everything is very nice.

CATHERINE

That's nice. I gotta letter from my

husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His

mother died.

MRS. PILLETTI

Oh.

CATHERINE

Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio,

owned the tavern in Abruzzi?

MRS. PILLETTI

I don't think I remember him.

CATHERINE

Well, he died. You know who else

died?

MRS. PILLETTI

Who?

CATHERINE

You know the old man upstairs in

this house. Old Irishman, always

drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna

hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.

MRS. PILLETTI

Well, I always like to visit you,

Catherine, because you always got

such cheerful news.

THOMAS

(suddenly)

Ma, you want something to eat, some

tuna fish?

MRS. PILLETTI

Hey, why don't you go to the movie?

Your mother and me, we're gonna be

baby-sitter.

VIRGINIA

Listen, let's go downa Kaplans'

apartment. They told us to come down.

MRS. PILLETTI

Sure, sure.

THOMAS

All right, Ma, we're going downstairs

to the Kaplans, if you want us for

anything.

CATHERINE

I wake up this morning, I hear the

baby crying. So I wake up. I come in

their room. That girl is shaking her

hand atta baby. I said, "You brute!

Don't you strike that baby! That's

my son's baby!"

MRS. PILLETTI

It's her baby too, you know.

CATHERINE

That's my son Thomas's baby.

MRS. PILLETTI

Well, it ain't your baby.

CATHERINE

Did I tell you she threw the bottle-

a milk at me?

MRS. PILLETTI

You told me.

CATHERINE

She's a witch, that one. I tell you

what happen yesterday?

MRS. PILLETTI

What happen?

CATHERINE

She gave me the evil eye.

MRS. PILLETTI

(scoffing)

Ufa!

CATHERINE

I keep one eye open when I sleep,

because she's gonna come in, stab me

in my bed.

MRS. PILLETTI

Catherine, I want you come live in

my house with Marty and me.

CATHERINE

Ah?

MRS. PILLETTI

You son Thomas and Virginia, they

come to my house this afternoon...

CATHERINE

(sharply)

Who?

MRS. PILLETTI

Your son Thomas and his wife

Virginia...

CATHERINE

When was this?

MRS. PILLETTI

This afternoon, about four, five

o'clock.

CATHERINE

What they say?

MRS. PILLETTI

You know what they say. They say

things are no good in this house.

Catherine, your son is married. Leave

him in peace. He wantsa be alone

with his wife. They don't want no

old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I

tell you what I think. I want you

come live with me in my house with

Marty and me. In my house, you have

your own room. You don't have to

sleep onna couch inna living room

like here. We will cook inna kitchen

and talk like when we were girls.

You are dear to me, and you are dear

to Marty. We are pleased for you to

come.

CATHERINE

My son Thomas came to see you this

afternoon, and he said to you he

wants to cast his mother from his

house?

MRS. PILLETTI

Catherine, don't make an opera outta

this. The three-a you anna baby live

in three skinny rooms. You are an

old goat, and she has an Italian

temper. She is a good girl, but you

drive her crazy. Catherine, you are

no fool. You know this is no good,

an old woman living with a husband

and wife. Two women inna same kitchen,

anna house burns down.

CATHERINE

So I am an old garbage bag, put inna

street.

MRS. PILLETTI

Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a

tragedy. You come to my house where

you know you be happier yourself.

CATHERINE

It pains that they should do this.

MRS. PILLETTI

I know it pains.

CATHERINE

These are the worst years, I tell

you.

MRS. PILLETTI

(with deep compassion)

Catherine, you are very dear to me.

We have cried many times together.

When my husband died, I would have

gone insane if it were not for you.

I ask you to come to my house, because

I can make you happy. Please come to

my house.

CATHERINE

These are the worst years. I tell

you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm

afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid

I'm gonna see an old lady with white

hair, like the old ladies inna park,

little bundles inna black shawl,

waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty-

six years old. What am I to do with

myself? I have strength in my hands.

I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna

make dinner for my children. Am I an

old dog to lie in fronta the fire

til my eyes close? These are the

terrible years, Theresa! Terrible

years!

MRS. PILLETTI

Catherine, my sister...

CATHERINE

It's gonna happen to you! It's gonna

happen to you! What will you do if

Marty gets married?! What will you

cook? What happen to alla children

playing in alla rooms? Where is the

noise?! It is a curse to be a widow!

A curse. What will you do if Marty

gets married?! What will you do?

CATHERINE

(continuing quietly)

I will put my clothes inna bag, and

I will come to you tomorrow.

MARTY

You come up here often?

CLARA

I was up here twice before. Once

with a friend of mine and once I

came up alone. The last time... do

you see that girl in the gray dress

sitting over there?

MARTY

Yeah.

CLARA

Well, the last time I was up here,

that's where I sat. I sat there for

an hour and a half, without moving a

muscle. Now and then, some fellow

would sort of walk up to me and then

change his mind. I'll never forget

just sitting there for an hour and a

half with my hands in my lap. Then I

began to cry, and I had to get up

and go home.

MARTY

I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.

CLARA

This is something recent with me,

this bursting into tears at the least

thing.

MARTY

Oh, I cry all the time, any little

thing. My brothers, my brother-in-

laws, they're always telling me what

a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you

don't get goodhearted by accident.

You get kicked around long enough,

you get to be a real professor of

pain. I know exactly how you feel.

And I also want you to know I'm having

a very good time with you now and

really enjoying myself. So you see,

you're not such a dog as you think

you are.

CLARA

I'm having a very good time, too.

MARTY

So there you are. So I guess I'm not

such a dog as I think I am.

CLARA

You're a very nice guy, and I don't

know why some girl hasn't grabbed

you off long ago.

MARTY

I don't know either. I think I'm a

very nice guy. I also think I'm a

pretty smart guy in my own way.

MARTY

Now I figure, two people get married,

and they gonna live together forty,

fifty years. So it's just gotta be

more than whether they're good looking

or not. You tell me you think you're

not very good-looking. My father was

a really ugly man, but my mother

adored him. She told me that she

used to get so miserable sometimes,

like everybody, you know? And she

says my father always tried to

understand. I used to see them

sometimes when I was a kid, sitting

in the living room, talking and

talking, and I used to adore my old

man, because he was so kind. That's

one of the most beautiful things I

have in my life, the way my father

and mother were. And my father was a

real ugly man. So it doesn't matter

if you look like a gorilla. So you

see, dogs like us, we ain't such

dogs as we think we are.

CLARA

I'm twenty-nine years old. How old

are you?

MARTY

I'm thirty-four.

MARTY

...you teach chemistry? That's funny.

Where? What school?

CLARA

Benjamin Franklin High School.

MARTY

Benjamin Franklin, where's that?

Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt

right up here on Fordham Road. It's

right arounna corner from my house.

I have a cousin who's a teacher. He

teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago.

He was studying to be a Jesuit, but

he gave it up after his first vows.

MARTY

(prattling on)

I was pretty good in high school. I

sound like a jerk now, but I was

pretty good. I graduated with an

eighty-two average. That ain't bad.

I was accepted at City College. I

filled out the application and

everything, but my old man died, so

I hadda go to work. My best class

was German. That was my first

language. Der, die, das -- des, der,

des. There you are, I still

remember...

MARTY

(chattering on)

You know what I was good at in high

school? I was good in Math. You know

how long ago I graduated high school?

June, nineteen-thirty-seven. Holy

cow! June, nineteen-thirty-seven!

What is that? Fifteen, seventeen

years ago! Holy cow! Seventeen years

ago! Is that right? Seventeen, that's

right. Where did it all go? I'm

getting old. I'm gonna be thirty-

five November eighth. Thirty-five.

Wow. Time goes on, boy.

MARTY

Nineteen-thirty-seven... that's right.

My old man died December, nineteen-

thirty-seven.

MARTY

Two o'clock in the morning he died.

The doorbell rings, and I knew

something was wrong right away.

Because my room is onna ground floor

inna front, you see, and I got outta

bed, and I answered the door...

MARTY

There was Mr. Stern. He had a house

down about a block from us. He moved

out though. My old man, he used to

play cards with him and some other

old guys. He's a Jewish feller. So

he said, "Is your mother home?" So I

knew right away there was something

wrong. I was only eighteen, exactly

eighteen years old, just the month

before. So I said, "Is something

wrong, Mr. Stern?" I was in my

pajamas, you know? So he said, "Marty,

your father died." My father died

right inna middle of playing cards,

right at the table. He had a heart

attack. He had low blood pressure,

my old man. He used to faint a lot.

MARTY

Boy, am I talking, I never talked so

much in my life. Usually, everybody

comes to me and tells me all their

troubles. Well, I'm gonna shut up

now, and I'm gonna let you get a

word in...

MARTY

Seventeen years ago. What I been

doing with myself all that time?...

Well, I'm talking again. I must be

driving you crazy. Mosta the time

I'm with a girl, I can't find a word

to say. Well, I'm gonna shut up now.

Because I'm not like this usually.

Usually, I... well, here I go again.

MARTY

I can't shut my mouth... I'm on a

jag, for Pete's sake. You'd think I

was loaded...

MARTY

I can't stop talking! Isn't this

stupid?!

MARTY

(with sudden sincerity)

You gotta real nice face, you know?

It's really a nice face.

CLARA

Thank you.

MARTY

...so I'm inna kneeling position,

and if you ever try shooting a BAR

inna kneeling position, you know

what I mean. I can't holda steady

position. I'm wavering back and

forth...

MARTY

...so the guy next to me, he's

shooting from the prone position,

and he's cross-eyed like I told you...

MARTY

So just then...

(stops to control

himself again)

...so just then I hear five shots go

off from the guy next to me...

MARTY

So my target goes down, and a minute

later, the flag comes up. I got five

bulls-eyes. This cross-eyed guy next

to me, he shot five bulls-eyes into

my target...

MARTY

...so I said to the sergeant who was

checking my score, "Pretty good, eh,

Sarge? Five bulls-eyes? So this

sergeant, he don't know what happened,

he says, "Say, that's all right,

Pilletti"...

MARTY

Oh, man. So that's what happened.

That's how I got the reputation-a

being the best shot inna whole

battalion... oh, man...

BUCKO

Anything good in there, Mac?

ANGIE

A buncha dogs.

ANGIE

Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty, you in here?!

MARTY

...When I got outta the army, Clara,

I was lost. I didn't know what I

wanted to do. I was twenny-five years

old, what was I gonna do, go back to

my old job, forty cents an hour. I

thought maybe I go to college under

the G.I. Biller Rights, you know?

But I wouldn't graduate till I was

twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old,

even if I made it in three years.

And my brother Freddie wanted to get

married, and I had three unmarried

sisters -- in an Italian home, that's

a terrible thing. And my kid brother

Nickie, he's a one got married last

week. So I just went to pieces. I

used to walk inna streets till three,

four o'clock inna mornings. My mother

used to be so worried about me. My

uncle Mario come over one time. He

offered me a job driving his hack

onna night shift. He got his own

cab, you know. And God forgive me

for what I'm gonna say now, but I

used to thinka doing away with myself.

I used to stand sometimes in the

subway, and God forgive me what I'm

going to say, I used to feel the

tracks sucking me down under the

wheels.

CLARA

(deeply sympathetic)

Yes, I know.

MARTY

I'm a Catholic, you know, and even

to think about suicide is a terrible

sin.

CLARA

Yes, I know.

MARTY

So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a

frienda my father -- he offered me

this job in his butcher shop, and

everybody pleaded with me to take

it. So that's what happened. I didn't

wanna be a butcher.

CLARA

There's nothing wrong with being a

butcher.

MARTY

Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant

profession. It's in a lower social

scale. People look down on butchers.

CLARA

I don't.

MARTY

Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa

sell his shop now, because he and

his wife are lonely, and they wanna

move out to California in Los Angeles

and live near their married daughter.

Because she's always writing them to

come out there. So it's a nice little

shop. I handle his books for him, so

I know he has a thirty-five percent

markup which is not unreasonable,

and he takes home net maybe a hundred,

hundred and fifty bucks a week. The

point is, of course, you gotta worry

about the supermarkets. There's two

inna neighborhood now, and there's

an A&P coming in, at least that's

the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade

is strictly Italian, but the younger

Italian girls, they get married, and

they don't stick to the old Italian

dishes so much. I mean, you gotta

take that into account too.

CLARA

It's my feeling that you really want

to buy this shop, Marty.

MARTY

That's true. I do. But I'm gonna

have to take outta loan inna bank

eight thousand dollars. That's a big

note to carry, because I have to

give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and

what I have to weigh is: will it pay

off in the end more than I can make

onna salary?

CLARA

Marty, I know you for three hours,

but I know you're a good butcher.

You're an intelligent, sensitive,

decent man. I have a feeling about

you like sometimes a kid comes in to

see me for one reason or another.

And some of these kids, Marty, in my

classes, they have so much warmth in

them, so much capacity. And that's

the feeling I get about you.

CLARA

If you were one of my students, I

would say, "Go ahead and buy the

butcher shop. You're a good butcher."

MARTY

(not quite trusting

the timbre of his

voice)

Well, there's a lotta things I could

do with this shop. I could organize

my own supermarket. Get a buncha

neighborhood merchants together.

That's what a lotta them are doing.

MARTY

Wadda you think?

CLARA

I think anything you want to do,

you'll do well.

MARTY

(still looking down)

I'm Catholic. Are you Catholic?

CLARA

(also in a low voice)

Yes, I am.

MARTY

I only got about three bucks on me

now, but I just live about eight

blocks from here on the other side

of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk

back to my house? I'll run in, pick

up some dough, and let's step out

somewhere.

CLARA

I really should get home...

MARTY

It's only a quarter of twelve. The

clock's right over there.

CLARA

I really should get home, I told my

father... Well, I suppose a little

while longer. I wonder if there's

any place around here I could put

some makeup on...

MARTY

Hey, Mac!

MARTY

You gotta Ladies' Room around here?

PROPRIETOR

Inna back.

MARTY

(to Clara)

Inna back.

FIRST IRISH WOMAN

...so she told me that the doctor

told her that if she had any more

babies, she would do so at the risk

of her life...

SECOND IRISH WOMAN

She was always a bit thin in the

hips...

FIRST IRISH WOMAN

Well, at the time she told me this,

she already had six. Every time I

saw the woman, she was either...

ANGIE

Hey, Lou!

FIRST IRISH WOMAN

...going to the hospital or coming

from it. She was hatching them out

like eggs.

SECOND IRISH WOMAN

And that husband of hers is a skinny

bit of a fellow, isn't he?

FIRST IRISH WOMAN

Well, I bumped into her on the street,

and she was as big as a barrel.

ANGIE

(loudly)

Hey, Lou!

BARTENDER

(looking up from

opening a batch of

beer bottles)

What?

FIRST IRISH WOMAN

...so I said to her, "Mary...

ANGIE

(calling to the

Bartender)

Marty been in here the last coupla

hours or so?

FIRST IRISH WOMAN

"...Mary, for heaven's sakes, didn't

you tell me that another one'll kill

you?"

BARTENDER

I ain't seen Marty all night...

SECOND IRISH WOMAN

And her husband is a little bit of a

man, isn't he?

ANGIE

(calling to the

Bartender, but even

more to himself)

Where is everybody? I been walking

around, I can't find anybody...

FIRST IRISH WOMAN

Well, last week Tuesday, she gave

birth to the baby in Saint Elizabeth's

hospital... a big healthy boy of

nine pounds...

SECOND IRISH WOMAN

Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was

wrong, wasn't he?

FIRST IRISH WOMAN

Oh, no! She died right in the

hospital...

SECOND IRISH WOMAN

Oh, that's a sad story. And her

husband is that little fellow, works

in Peter Reeves.

FIRST IRISH WOMAN

That's the one.

SECOND IRISH WOMAN

Oh, that's a sad story.

CLARA

...It's really a fine opportunity

for me. But I'm not sure I want to

be a department head. It's mostly

executive and administrative work.

Well, anyway, I told you about my

father, and he depends on me a great

deal, and...

MARTY

(still concentrating

on his shoelace)

Why don't you just move out to

Portchester?

CLARA

Well, that's what I was saying. My

father is getting old. And we're

very close. He's a wonderful man,

really...

MARTY

I think you're kidding yourself,

Clara. I used to think about moving

out, you know? And that's what I

used to say. "My mother needs me."

But when you really get down to it,

that ain't it at all. Actually, you

need your father. You know what I

mean? You're living at home, and you

got your father and mother there,

and you can go on like that -- being

a little girl all your life.

CLARA

I'm afraid of being lonely.

MARTY

Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll

make friends right away.

CLARA

Actually, I don't make friends easily.

MARTY

What're you talking about? You're a

real likeable person. You'll make

friends out there in Portchester

one, two, three. You'll have people

visiting you alla time. I'll come

visit you. I'll borrow my brother

Freddie's car, or you can call me up

when you feel blue, or I'll call you

up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be

so afraid.

RALPH'S VOICE

(off-screen)

Hey, Marty!

RALPH

(yelling)

Hey, Marty!

RALPH

Marty! Over here!

MARTY

Hello, Ralph.

RALPH

(yelling)

Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.

RALPH

(explaining to girls)

You'll like this guy. This guy's a

nice guy.

LEO

Who's this? Marty?

RALPH

Yeah.

LEO

(confirming Ralph's

statement)

Oh, this guy's a nice guy.

MARTY

(approaching the car)

Hello, Ralph, what's new?

(looks through the

back window,

recognizes Leo)

Hiya, Leo.

LEO

Hiya, Marty.

RALPH

(indicates with his

head that he wishes

to hold a whispered

conference with Marty)

Hey, Marty, come here a minute.

RALPH

(lowering his voice)

Hey, Marty, we got an odd squirrel

here, you interested?

MARTY

Waddaya mean, Ralph?

RALPH

(turning his head

toward the rear of

the car and raising

his voice)

Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty

Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly,

inna back seat there.

MARTY

Hiya.

LOUISE

What are we going to do, just sit

around here all night?

RALPH

(addressing Marty's

bowed head in a quick

mutter)

Listen, Marty, these three squirrels

are nurses. We're all going over

Leo's house later because there's

nobody there. These are the squirrels

I told you about. Money inna bank,

man. Wanna get inna car? She's a

pretty nice-looking doll.

MARTY

I'm with a girl, Ralph.

RALPH

Get ridda her. This is money inna

bank.

MARTY

I can't do that, Ralph, because

somebody already brushed her off

once tonight.

RALPH

This is a good deal here, Marty.

MARTY

(bending down to Ralph)

I can't do it, Ralph. Thanks anyway.

(looks toward back

seat)

Very nice to have met you all.

LOUISE

Come on, let's get outta here.

LEO

Hey, Ralph, we might as well get

going.

MARTY

I'll see you, Leo.

LEO

I'll see you, Marty.

DISSOLVE TO:

MARTY

Wait a minute. Lemme find the light.

MARTY

I guess my mother ain't home yet. I

figure my cousin Thomas and Virginia

musta gone to the movies, so they

won't get back till one o'clock at

least.

MARTY

This is the kitchen.

CLARA

Yes, I know.

MARTY

Come on inna dining room.

MARTY

Siddown, take off your coat. You

want something to eat? We gotta whole

half-chicken in the icebox.

CLARA

(alighting tentatively

on the edge of a

chair)

No, thank you. I don't think I should

stay very long.

MARTY

Sure. Just take off your coat a

minute.

MARTY

So I was telling you, my kid brother

Nickie got married last Sunday. That

was a very nice affair. And they had

this statue of some woman, and they

had whiskey spouting outta her mouth.

I never saw anything so grand in my

life.

(the silence again

falls between them.)

And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I

know a good hunka steak when I see

one. That was choice filet, right

off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty

a pound. Of course, if you wanna

cheaper cut, get rib steak. That

gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes

to about a buck and a quarter a pound,

if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make

yourself comfortable. You're all

tense.

CLARA

Oh, I'm fine.

MARTY

You want me to take you home, I'll

take you home.

CLARA

Maybe that would be a good idea.

CLARA

No, Marty, please...

MARTY

I like you. I like you. I been telling

you all night, I like you...

CLARA

Marty...

MARTY

I just wanna kiss, that's all.

CLARA

No...

MARTY

Please...

CLARA

No...

MARTY

Please...

CLARA

Marty...

MARTY

All right! I'll take you home! All

right!

MARTY

All I wanted was a lousy kiss! What

do you think, I was gonna try

something serious with my mother

coming home any minute!? What am I,

a leper or something?!

CLARA

(more to herself than

to him)

I just didn't feel like it, that's

all.

MARTY

I'm old enough to know better. Comes

New Year's Eve, everybody starts

arranging parties, I'm the guy they

gotta dig up a date for. Let me getta

packa cigarettes, and I'll take you

home.

CLARA

I'd like to see you again. Very much.

The reason I didn't let you kiss me

was because I just didn't know how

to handle the situation. You're the

kindest man I ever met. The reason I

tell you this is because I want to

see you again very much. I know that

when you take me home, I'm going to

just lie on my bed and think about

you. I want very much to see you

again.

MARTY

(without looking over

at her)

Waddaya doing tomorrow night?

CLARA

Nothing.

MARTY

I'll call you up tomorrow morning.

Maybe, we'll go see a movie.

CLARA

I'd like that very much.

MARTY

The reason I can't be definite about

it now is my Aunt Catherine is

probably coming over tomorrow, and I

may have to help out.

CLARA

I'll wait for your call.

MARTY

We better get started to your house,

because the buses only run about one

an hour now.

CLARA

All right.

MARTY

I'll just get a packa cigarettes.

MARTY

Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?

CLARA

Nothing.

MRS. PILLETTI'S VOICE

(off-screen)

Hallo! Hallo! Marty?!

MRS. PILLETTI

Hello, Marty, when you come home?

MARTY

We just got here about fifteen minutes

ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss

Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New

York University. She teaches chemistry

in Benjamin Franklin High School.

MRS. PILLETTI

Siddown, siddown. You want some

chicken? We got some chicken in the

ice box.

CLARA

No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going

home. Thank you very much anyway.

MRS. PILLETTI

Well, siddown a minute. I just come

inna house. I'll take off my coat.

Siddown a minute.

MARTY

How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give

you a ride?

MRS. PILLETTI

(nodding)

Oh, it's a sad business.

(turning to Clara)

My sister, Catherine, she don't get

along with her daughter-in-law, so

she's gonna come live with us.

MARTY

Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?

MRS. PILLETTI

Oh, sure.

(to Clara)

Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her

siddown.

MARTY

Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.

MRS. PILLETTI

(to Marty)

Did you offer the young lady some

fruit?

MARTY

I offered her, Ma, she don't want

nothing.

CLARA

No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.

MRS. PILLETTI

(to Clara with a sigh)

It's a very sad business, I tell

you. A woman, fifty-six years old,

all her life, she had her own home.

Now she's just an old lady, sleeping

on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's

a curse to be a mother, I tell you.

Your children grow up and then what

is left for you to do? What is a

mother's life but her children? It

is a very cruel thing when your son

has no place for you in his home.

CLARA

Couldn't she find some sort of hobby

to fill out her time?

MRS. PILLETTI

Hobby! What can she do? She cooks

and she cleans. You gotta have a

house to clean. You gotta have

children to cook for. These are the

terrible years for a woman, the

terrible years.

CLARA

You mustn't feel too harshly against

her daughter-in-law. She also wants

to have a house to clean and a family

to cook for.

MRS. PILLETTI

You don't think my sister Catherine

should live in her daughter-in-law's

house?

CLARA

Well, I don't know the people, of

course, but as a rule, I don't think

a mother-in-law should live with a

young couple.

MRS. PILLETTI

Where do you think a mother-in-law

should go?

CLARA

I don't think a mother should depend

so much upon her children for her

rewards in life.

MRS. PILLETTI

Well, maybe that's what they teach

you in New York University. In real

life, it don't work out that way.

You wait till you are a mother.

CLARA

It's silly of me to argue about it.

I don't know the people involved.

MARTY

Ma, I'm gonna take her home now.

It's getting late, and the buses

only run about one an hour.

MRS. PILLETTI

(standing)

Sure.

CLARA

MRS. PILLETTI

ANGIE

Hey, Marty! Hey!

ANGIE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

Hey, Marty! Marty!

ANGIE

Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I

MARTY

I looked for you, Angie, before I

cut out, but I couldn't find you.

ANGIE

MARTY

What happened, Angie, was that we

thought we were just gonna go for a

short walk, and then we thought we

were gonna come right back, but we

got to talking. Listen, Angie, I

(he tries to turn the

sullen Angie toward

Clara)

Clara, this is my best friend, Angie.

I told you about him.

CLARA

ANGIE

(completely ignoring

Clara now)

Waddaya gonna do now?

MARTY

ANGIE

You want me to ride down with you?

MARTY

CLARA

MARTY

Taxi! Taxi! Hey, taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

MARTY

Taxi!... Taxi!...

VIRGINIA

(heavy whisper)

Don't you think I feel lousy about

this too?

THOMAS

All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna

talk anymore about it.

(sits on a wooden

chair, unrolls a

fresh pair of socks

he's been holding)

I don't think I got one hour's sleep

the whole night.

(raises one leg to

put a sock on, pauses

with his heel on the

edge of his chair)

Last night was the first time in my

life I ever heard my mother cry, you

know that?

VIRGINIA

Tommy...

THOMAS

(snapping)

I don't wanna talk about it!

THOMAS

(continuing, huffy)

I know what you're gonna say. A man's

gotta stop being his mother's baby

sooner or later. How many times you

gonna say it? She's my mother, you

know. I oughta have some feelings

about her, don't you think?

VIRGINIA

Why do you always put me inna position

of being the louse?

THOMAS

(in a furious whisper)

Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more

about it!

VIRGINIA

Tommy, I love you, and I know you

feel lousy right now, but we're never

gonna be happy unless we have a chance

to work out our own lives. We can't

keep talking in whispers like this

the resta our lives. We gotta have

some privacy. We...

THOMAS

(scowling)

Can't you wait five minutes? I'll

drive you over inna car. I just gotta

put my shirt on, that's all.

THOMAS

All right, get dressed, because we're

gonna drive my mother over. Why

couldn't you get along with her?!

Why couldn't you make just a little

effort?! She's a little hard to get

along with! All right! All I asked

you was try a little.

VIRGINIA

Tommy...

THOMAS

(roaring out)

I don't wanna hear anymore about it,

you hear me?

THOMAS

Hello, Aunt Theresa.

MRS. PILLETTI

Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?

THOMAS

(setting the bag down)

Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy.

I hadda beg her to let me drive her

over here. The martyr. She always

gotta be the big martyr.

CATHERINE

Hey, will you go to mass, please.

This one, he woke up this morning

with salt in his nose. Do this! Do

that! Will you leave me in peace,

ah?

MARTY

(ebulliently)

Hello, Aunt Catherine! How are you?

Hello, Thomas. You going to mass

with us?

CATHERINE

I was at mass two hours ago.

MARTY

Well, make yourself at home. The

refrigerator is loaded with food. Go

upstairs, take any room you want.

Thomas, you going to mass with us?

THOMAS

(nods)

Yeah, yeah, sure.

MRS. PILLETTI

(to Catherine)

You wanna cuppa coffee?

MARTY

Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?

THOMAS

Sure, great if you ain't married.

MARTY

Hi, Virginia.

MARTY

(to baby)

Hey, little boy, you sure getting

fat. You weigh more than a side-a

beef now.

(beams at the baby)

Hey, Thomas, so I was telling you

yesterday you was over my house --

Mr. Gazzara, my boss, so he wantsa

sell his shop, go out to California

because his kids are all married,

and he...

THOMAS

Wadda you so sore about?

VIRGINIA

Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?

MARTY

So Thomas, he does about twelve,

thirteen hundred gross. Rent's a

hundred and two. The problem, of

course, is the supermarkets. That's

what I wanna ask you. If I get

together with a coupla other

merchants, make our own supermarket...

THOMAS

What about the time she wanted to

make an old-fashioned Italian dinner

for my brother, but you wouldn't let

her!?

VIRGINIA

(with her own temper)

Waddaya talking about?!!

THOMAS

Once a month you couldn't let her

use the kitchen!

VIRGINIA

I told her she could use the kitchen

any time she wanted...

THOMAS

...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen

alla time!

VIRGINIA

She don't wanna use my pots and pans!

MARTY

So Tommy...

VIRGINIA

Waddaya want me to do, go out and

buy a whole new setta pots and pans?!

MARTY

Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because

I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him

know tomorrow. See, what I wanna

know, Tom, if a buncha individual

retail merchants get together, how

does it operate? On individual mark-

ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm

the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's

the dairyman and grocer, so suppose

I mark up thirty-five percent, but

he works on forty, so...

THOMAS

Waddaya talking about, do you know

what you're talking about?

MARTY

No, I don't know. That's why I'm

asking you.

THOMAS

Take the baby, will you?!

THOMAS

Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will

you tell me? You gotta good job, you

got no wife, you got no

responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was

you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself

down with a shop? What's he want?

Five thousand down? You're gonna

have to carry a mortgage sixty,

seventy bucks a month. A mortgage

anna note from the bank. For Pete's

sake, you're a single man with no

responsibilities. Stay that way,

boy. Take my advice.

MARTY

Well, you see, Thomas I figure the

big problem is the supermarkets. But

Patsy's shop, that's a specialized

trade. The supermarkets don't carry

Italian meat.

THOMAS

Who buys Italian meat anymore? You

think my wife buys Italian meat?

(throws a baleful

glance at his wife)

She goes to the A&P, picks up some

lamb chops wrapped in cellophane,

opens up a canna peas, and that's

dinner, boy.

VIRGINIA

Sure, all you wanna eat is that greasy

stuff your mother makes.

MARTY

Well, I understand the problem about

the supermarkets, but I was talking

to this girl last night, and she

made the point that a likeable

personality is a valuable business

asset.

THOMAS

Marty, see that my mother is nice

and comfortable, eh?

MARTY

Sure. This girl said...

THOMAS

What girl, what does she know?

(he whirls on his

wife again)

Why don't you let her hold the baby

once in a while?! Your mother, boy,

she wantsa take the kid for a day,

that's fine!

VIRGINIA

(her temper flaring

again)

Your mother handles the kid like he

was a yoyo!

MRS. PILLETTI

Hey, I come home from your house

last night, Marty was here with a

girl.

CATHERINE

Who?

MRS. PILLETTI

Marty.

CATHERINE

Your son Marty?

MRS. PILLETTI

Well, what Marty you think is gonna

be here in this house with a girl?

CATHERINE

Were the lights on?

MRS. PILLETTI

Oh sure.

(frowns at her sister)

This girl is a college graduate.

CATHERINE

They're the worst. College girls are

one step from the streets. They smoke

like men inna saloon. My son Joseph,

his wife, you know, she types onna

typewriter. One step from the streets,

I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders

this philosophy for a moment.

MRS. PILLETTI

That's the first time Marty ever

brought a girl to this house. She

seems like a nice girl. I think he

has a feeling for this girl. You

heard him sing. He been singing like

that all morning.

CATHERINE

Well, that's all. You will see. Today,

tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say

to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being

a single man. I'm tired-a running

around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey,

Ma, wadda we need this old house?

Why don't we sell this old house,

move into a nicer parta town? A nice

little apartment?"

MRS. PILLETTI

I don't sell this house, I tell you

that. This is my husband's house. I

had six children in this house.

CATHERINE

You will see. A coupla months, you

gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna

couch in her daughter-in-law's house.

MRS. PILLETTI

Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom.

Wherever you are, the rain follows.

Someday, you gonna smile, and we

gonna declare a holiday.

MARTY

Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting

a little late.

MRS. PILLETTI

Sure.

MARTY

Boy, this place is really coming to

pieces.

(turning to his mother)

You know, Ma, I think we oughta sell

this place. The whole joint's going

to pieces. The plumbing is rusty.

Everything. I'm gonna have to

replaster the whole ceiling now. You

know what we oughta do? We oughta

get one of those new apartments

they're building down on Southern

Boulevard. A nicer parta town, you

know?...You all set, Ma?

MRS. PILLETTI

I'm all set.

MRS. PILLETTI

That was a nice girl last night,

Marty.

(Marty nods)

She wasn't a very good-looking girl,

but she looks like a nice girl.

(she pauses, Marty

makes no reply)

I said, she wasn't a very good-looking

girl... not very pretty...

MARTY

(still amiable)

I heard you, Ma.

MRS. PILLETTI

She looks a little old for you. About

thirty-five, forty years old?

MARTY

She's twenty-nine, Ma.

MRS. PILLETTI

She's more than twenty-nine years

old, Marty. That's what she tells

you.

MARTY

What, Ma?

MRS. PILLETTI

She looks thirty-five, forty. She

didn't look Italian to me.

MRS. PILLETTI

I said, is she Italian girl?

MARTY

I don't know. I don't think so.

MRS. PILLETTI

She don't look Italian to me. What

kinda family she come from? There

was something about her I didn't

like. It seems funny, the first time

you meet her, she comes to your empty

house alone. These college girls,

they all one step fromma streets.

MARTY

What are you talking about? She's a

nice girl.

MRS. PILLETTI

She didn't look Italian to me.

MRS. PILLETTI

I don't like her.

MARTY

You don't like her. You only met her

for two minutes.

MRS. PILLETTI

Don't bring her to the house no more.

MARTY

What didn't you like about her?

MRS. PILLETTI

I don't know! She don't look like

Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian

girls around.

MARTY

Well, let's not get inna fight about

it, Ma.

MARTY

(stopping her before

she gets started)

What are you getting so worked up

about? I just met the girl last night.

I'm probably not gonna see her again.

MARTY

Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?

BARTENDER

He was here last night till about

two o'clock. I hear you really got

stuck with a dog last night.

MARTY

(glancing quickly at

him)

Who told you that?

BARTENDER

Angie. He says she was a real scrawny-

looking thing.

MARTY

She wasn't so bad.

MARTY

Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out

with those nurses last night, Ralph?

RALPH

(looking up)

Oh man, you shoulda come with us

last night, Marty. That one for you

was a real lunatic. How'd you make

out?

MARTY

Oh, I hadda nice time...I didn't try

nothing. She's a nice girl. I just

met her last night, you know. I just

talked with her. I didn't even try

nothing...

MARTY

Listen, you see Angie, tell him I

went home, I'll meet him after lunch.

DISSOLVE TO:

JOE

...so the whole book winds up, Mike

Hammer, he's inna room there with

this doll. So he says, "You rat, you

are the murderer." So she begins to

con him, you know? She tells him how

she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots

her in the stomach. So she's laying

there, gasping for breath, and she

says, "How could you do that?" And

he says, "It was easy."

LEO

(without looking up

from his magazine)

Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he

can write.

MARTY

We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We

give you a plate-a your own.

ANGIE

Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother

just stuffed me right up to the jaws.

JOE

What I like about Mickey Spillane is

he knows how to handle women. In one

book, he picks up a tomato who gets

hit with a car, and she throws a

pass at him. And then he meets two

beautiful twins, and they throw passes

at him. And then he meets some

beautiful society leader, and she

throws a pass at him, and...

LEO

Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure

can write.

ANGIE

Listen, somebody turn onna ballgame.

It must be after one o'clock by now.

ANGIE

Who you gonna call?

MARTY

I was gonna call that girl from last

night. Take her to a movie tonight.

ANGIE

Are you kidding?

MARTY

Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you

were very impolite last night. I

introduced you to the girl, you just

turned and walked off. Now, why did

you do that?

ANGIE

You got me mad, that's why. Hey,

Joe, show Marty that picture.

MARTY

Put that away, for Pete's sake. My

mother's right out onna porch.

JOE

I wonder where they find those girls

that pose for them pictures.

LEO

Those are Hollywood starlets.

MARTY

Put it away, Joe. My mother'll come

walking in.

ANGIE

Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second

Street area tonight.

MARTY

I don't feel like going, Angie. I

thought I'd take this girl to a movie.

ANGIE

Boy, you really musta made out good

last night.

MARTY

We just talked.

ANGIE

Boy, she musta been some talker. She

musta been about fifty years old.

JOE

I always figure a guy oughta marry a

girl who's twenny years younger than

he is so that when he's forty, his

wife is a real nice-looking doll.

LEO

That means he'd have to marry the

girl when she was one year old.

JOE

I never thoughta that.

MARTY

I didn't think she was so bad-looking.

ANGIE

She musta kept you inna shadows all

night.

RALPH

Marty, you don't wanna hang around

with dogs. It gives you a bad

reputation.

ANGIE

Let's go downa Seventy-Second Street.

MARTY

I told this dog I was gonna call her

today about two-thirty.

ANGIE

(angry)

Brush her. Listen, you wanna come

with me tonight, or you wanna go

with this dog?

MARTY

Waddaya getting so sore about?

ANGIE

I looked all over for you last night,

you know that?

JOE

Another book that I read by Mickey

Spillane, I can't remember the name

of it, but it was about this red-

headed tramp he finds inna street,

and he gives her some dough, because

he's sorry for her... Wait a minute,

I think that's the same book I was

telling you about before...

MARTY

(to Angie)

You didn't like her at all?

ANGIE

A nothing. A real nothing.

JOE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

You know something...?

JOE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

...I can't tell one-a those Mickey

Spillane books from the other, but

he's a real good writer, though...

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

DISSOLVE TO:

MRS. PILLETTI

So what are you gonna do tonight,

Marty?

MARTY

I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked

out. I think I'll just hang arounna

house and watch...

MARTY

Maybe, I'll go out and see what Angie

and the boys are doing...

LEO

What time is it?

JOE

About eight o'clock.

ANGIE

(to George)

You don't feel like going downna

Seventy-Second Street?

GEORGE

It'll take an hour anna hour back,

and the whole evening's gone.

JOE

What's playing on Fordham Road? I

think there's a good picture in the

Loew's Paradise.

GEORGE

You guys feel like working up a game-

a cards?

ANGIE

Come on, let's go down Seventy-Second

Street, walk around. We're sure to

wind up with something.

JOE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

I'll never forgive LaGuardia for

cutting out burlesque outta New York

City...

GEORGE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

There's a burlesque in Union City.

Let's go over to Union City...

ANGIE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

Yeah, you're the one who don't even

wanna take a ride onna subway for

half an hour. Now, you wanna go alla

way over to Union City...

GEORGE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

I feel like playing cards. I saw

Richie Rizzo, that's what he said he

felt like doing...

JOE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

I don't feel like playing cards.

Waddaya feel like doing tonight,

Angie?

ANGIE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

I don't know. Wadda you feel like

doing?

JOE'S VOICE

(off-screen)

I don't know, Angie. Wadda you feel

like doing?

MARTY

"What are you doing tonight?"... "I

don't know, what are you doing?!"...

MARTY

(continuing)

The burlesque! Loew's Paradise!

Miserable and lonely! Miserable and

lonely and stupid! What am I, crazy

or something?! I got something good

here! What am I hanging around with

you guys for?!

ANGIE

Watsa matter with you?

MARTY

You don't like her. My mother don't

like her. She's a dog, and I'm a

fat, ugly little man. All I know is

I hadda good time last night. I'm

gonna have a good time tonight. If

we have enough good times together,

I'm gonna go down on my knees and

beg that girl to marry me. If we

make a party again this New Year's,

I gotta date for the party. You don't

like her, that's too bad.

MARTY

(his old amiable self)

When you gonna get married, Angie?

Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You're

thirty-three years old. All your kid

brothers are married. You oughta be

ashamed of yourself.

MARTY

Hello... Clara?...

THE END
