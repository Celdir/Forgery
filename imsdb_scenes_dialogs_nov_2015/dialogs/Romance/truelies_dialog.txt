Well.  And I thought this was

HARRY

I'm late.

HELEN

Me too.

HELEN

How'd it go at the trade show?

You make all the other salesmen

jealous?

HARRY

Yeah.  You should have seen it.

We were the hit of the show with

the new model ordering system,

the one for the 680... how you

can write up an order and the

second the customer's name goes

into the computer, it starts

checking their credit, and if

they've ordered anything in the

past, and if they get a

discount...

HELEN

(barely listening)

That's fabulous Harry.

HARRY

Yeah, it was wild.

The plumber came yesterday.  He

said they have to dig under the

slab or something and it's going

to be six hundred dollars to fix.

HARRY

Uh huh.  Okay.

HELEN

It's not okay.  It's extortion.

HARRY

What did you tell him?

HELEN

I slept with him and he knocked

off a hundred bucks.

HARRY

Good thinking, honey.

41   INT. KITCHEN - DAY

GIB

Hi, kid.

Hey, Gib.  What up?

GIB

Kids.  Ten seconds of joy.

Thirty years of misery.

HARRY

She knows not to steal.  I've

taught her better than that.

GIB

Yeah, but you're not her parents,

anymore, you and Helen.  Her

parents are Axl Rose and Madonna.

The five minutes you spend a day

with her can't compete with that

kind of constant bombardment.

You're outgunned, amigo.

Morning, Charlene.

GIB

See, kids now are ten years ahead                      *

You probably think she's still a

virgin--

HARRY

Don't be ridiculous.  She's only --

how old is she?

GIB

Fourteen, Harry.

HARRY

Right.  She's only fourteen.

GIB

Uh huh.  And her little hormones

are going like a fire alarm.  I                        *

say even money that physicist on                       *

the bike is boinkin' her.                              *

HARRY

No way.  Not Dana.

GIB

Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just

a river in Egypt.  She's probably

stealing the money to pay for an

abortion.

HARRY

Will you just open the door!                           *

GIB

Or drugs.

GIB

Twenty here, fifty there... I

HARRY

I thought you moved out.

GIB

Well .  .  .  I moved back in.

My lawyer said it would give me

a better claim on the house in

Gentlemen, please idenitify

JANICE

Thank you.  You are cleared.

GIB

Janice, how many years have you

been buzzing us in?

JANICE

Ten, Mr. Gibson.

GIB

And you still reach for your

piece every time.

JANICE

Yes sir.

GIB

God!  You have no idea how much

that turns me on.  I've never had

the courage to say this before

but... I love you, Janice.

JANICE

Yes, sir.

HARRY

You better watch it.  She might

file on you for sexual

harassment.

GIB

In her dreams.

HARRY

Come on, Fize.  We're late for

our butt-grinding.

49   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

TRILBY

Jesus, Harry!  You guys really

screwed the pooch last night.

Please tell me how I can look at

this, that it's not a total pooch-

screw.

HARRY

Total is a strong word--

GIB

There are degrees of totality.

FAISIL

It's a scale really, with

"perfect mission" on one end and

"total pooch-screw" on the other

and we're more about here--

TRILBY

Faisil.  You're new on Harry's

team, aren't you?

FAISIL

Yes.

TRILBY

So what makes you think that the

slack I cut him in any way

translates to you?!

FAISIL

Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we

got.

FAISIL

Jamal Khaled.  We think he's

dirty so we raid his financial

files...  Check it out...

FAISIL

One hundred million in wire

transfers from the COMMERCE BANK                       *

INTERNATIONAL--                                        *

GIB

Which we all know is a front for

certain nations to fund terrorist                      *

activities.  Something big is                          *

going down --

FAISIL                                       *

And we know that a week ago four                       *

MIRV warheads were smuggled out                        *

of the former Soviet Republic of                       *

Kazakhstan .  .  .

HARRY                                        *

We think Khaled's group has                            *

bought the nukes and is bringing                       *

them to U.S.  soil.                                    *

TRILBY                                       *

So far this is not blowing my

skirt up, gentleman.  Do you have                      *

anything remotely substantial?                         *

Don't be pumping beets up my ass                       *

here.  Do you have hard data?                          *

HARRY                                        *

Not what  you'd call rock hard.                        *

GIB                                          *

It's pretty limp, actually.                            *

TRILBY                                       *

Then perhaps you better get some                       *

... before somebody parks a car                        *

in front of the White House with

a nuclear weapon in the trunk!

50   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

HELEN

I mean, it's not like he's saving

the world or anything.  He's a

sales rep for Chrissakes.

Whenever I can't get to sleep I

ask him to tell me about his day.

Six seconds and I'm out.  But he

acts like he's curing cancer or

something.

ALLISON

So I guess you didn't get away                         *

for the weekend after all?                             *

Are you kidding?  Harry had to go

out of town.

ALLISON

I'm shocked.

HELEN

Yeah.  You know Harry.

Helen, have you pulled those

anything interesting?

ALLISON                                      *

Oh... Eric and I drove up to this                      *

little romantic inn, and...                            *

pretty much lapped champagne out

of each other's navels for two

days.

HELEN

You bitch.

ALLISON

Girlfriend, you got a man.  You                        *

just have to take control .  .

.  set up the right mood.                              *

HELEN

Harry only has two moods: busy...                      *

and asleep.

ALLISON

Then you better do something to                        *

jumpstart that man's motor.  You

know... wake up the sleeping

giant of his passion.

What'ya got?

FAISIL

Here, check this out--

GIB

It's a two million dollar

disbursement from Khaled to...

Juno Skinner.

(Harry raises an

eyebrow)

Uh huh.  The babe at the party.                        *

HARRY

It doesn't mean anything.  She

buys antiquities for Khaled.

GIB

Nope.  The art buys are in a

separate ledger.

FAISIL

And this is a little above market-                     *

rate for the horizontal bop, even                      *

for a total biscuit like her.

HARRY

Alright, I want a complete workup

on her.  Do we know where she is?

FAISIL

Uh huh.  Right here in river

city.

HARRY

You're kidding.

FAISIL

She lives in Rome, but she does

stuff here the Smithsonian and

has a lot of diplomatic

connections, so she has offices                        *

here.                                                  *

GIB

Sounds like a job for a

specialist.

52   INT. TASKER HOUSE/ KITCHEN - NIGHT (10PM)

HELEN

I need you to talk to Dana.  The

class again this afternoon.

HARRY

I'll handle it.

53   EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

HARRY

Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why

weren't you in class today?

DANA

He lies!  I was there!  I was in

the nurse's office, cause I had

a headache.

HARRY

You seem fine now.

DANA

Great!  You're going to believe

that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over

your own daughter.

HARRY

I'm not sure what to believe

anymore, young lady.  You never

used to lie to me.  But lately

you don't seem to know the

difference between right and

wrong.

HARRY

Dana, are you listening to me?

DANA

Yeah, Dad.

HARRY

You know you can always talk to

me.  Right?  Whatever is going on

in your life, your mom and I'll

understand.

DANA

Okay, Dad.

HARRY

You'd tell me if there was

something wrong, wouldn't you,

pumpkin?

DANA

I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do

I look even remotely like a

pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a

cupcake or a honeybear either!

And you don't understand anything

HARRY

--corporate art consulting

company in San Francisco.  I have

an appointment with Ms. Skinner--

JUNO

Harry!  I thought I might see you

again.  I just didn't  except you

to call so soon.

HARRY

Well, what's the point of

waiting?

JUNO

I agree.

JUNO

So your clients want something

for the lobby of their new

corporate headquarters?

HARRY

That's right.  They want

something...  dramatic.  I spoke

to a number of people who said

you're the one to see.

JUNO

So what did these... people...

say about me exactly?

HARRY

Let's see... that you can read

ancient Sanskrit without having

to sound out the words.  And that

other dealers and archeologists

don't like you much.

JUNO

Those wimps.  It's because I use                       *

my diplomatic contacts to export

cultural treasures from countries

which tell them to take a hike.

(yelling in Arabic to

two workmen)

I told you to move those crates

an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's

get going.

JUNO

You see, a lot of these pieces

are from ancient Persia.

Unfortunately, ancient Persia is

twenty feet under the sand of                          *

Iran, Iraq and Syria.  Not the

most popular places lately.  So

I've had to become an expert in

Do you like my tomb?  The museum                       *

financing fell out, so I thought                       *

your clients might be interested.

HARRY

It's certainly... dramatic.

JUNO

Especially in this light.  This

is the only light they had then,                       *

so I like to study it this way.

I love this place.  I love all

ruins.

HARRY

Is that why you got into this

business?

JUNO

I've always been a collector at

heart.  When I see something I

want, I have to have it.

HARRY

And you have a reputation as

someone who gets what she wants.

JUNO

Yes, I do.

65   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

GIB

Harry, this is your conscience

speaking...

66   INT. TOMB - NIGHT

JUNO

Look at this.  People who dies

twenty centuries ago.

JUNO

They breathed and loved and wept,

just like us.  And now their

ideals, their religions, their

social orders... are gone like

mist.  What did any of it matter?

JUNO

I only hope they lived well.

That they got what they wanted.

JUNO

Getting what you want is the only

important thing.

67   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

GIB

Harry?  Listen to the following

code word.  Helen.  H-E-L-E-N.

Now, do you want me to I beep

you?

68   INT. TOMB - NIGHT

HARRY

Yes.

JUNO

Yes what?

HARRY

Uh, yes, it is important.

HARRY

Uh, it looks like I have to run.

I'll call you tomorrow.  Your

proposal is very interesting.

71   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

GIB

We have a friend.  Five cars

back, inside lane.  They've been                       *

on us since we left Juno's.                            *

HARRY

Station wagon?

GIB

Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?

HARRY                                        *

No.  We need this lead.                                *

(into his Rover)                                  *

UNIT SEVEN (FAISIL)                          *

Seven here.

HARRY

(into Rover)                                      *

I need you at the Georgetown mall                      *

in three minutes.                                      *

SEVEN

Copy that.  We're rolling.

GIB

Helen's going to be pissed.

HARRY

See, that's the problem with

terrorists.  They're really

inconsiderate when it comes to

people's schedules.

What's the plan?

HARRY

Gonna try to get a closer shot of                      *

Helen?  Hi, it's Gib.  Harry

remembered something he left at

the office.  You know Harry.

79   INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

HELEN

Yeah, Gib.  I know Harry.

HELEN

Where are you going?

DANA

Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough

about us to be here on his

birthday, then why should I care?

I'm going to a movie.

HELEN

No you're not.  You're going to

stay here until your father gets

home and have cake!

DANA

Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows

we exist.

HELEN

That's not true, honey--

DANA

It is true!  He doesn't know

anything about me.  He still

thinks I'm like ten years old or

something.  As long as I just

smile and say yes to whatever he

says, like his good little

fantasy daughter, he thinks

everything's fine.  But it's not

fine.  Nothing's fine.

HELEN

Dana!  Come back here!

HARRY

Look, I know you're upset.  I'm

really sorry, honey.  I raced

HELEN

It's okay, don't bother, Harry.

HARRY

I'm sorry.  Thank you for the

party.

HELEN

Yeah.  It was great.

Let's go to bed, Harry.  There's

only one present you have to open

tonight.

HELEN

Don't move.  I'll be right back.

HARRY

Come on to bed, you don't have to

brush your teeth.

HELEN

I'll just be a second.  So what

happened tonight at the office?

HARRY

I couldn't believe it.  I go back

to get this report I need, right,

and the phone is ringing, so like

a bonehead I answer it--

HARRY

It's the big client in Japan,

and it's the middle of the

morning there and their whole

system is crashed... this guy's

having a meltdown--

HELEN

(keeping him talking)

What'd you do, honey?

HARRY

Well I pull out the manual on

their setup, which is the new 680

server...

HARRY (CONT'D)

...and I'm troubleshooting it

with them over the phone...

talking to a translator, right,

who's getting half of it wrong...

it was unbelievable...  really

wild.

HELEN

(putting on black

pumps)

It sounds wild.  So now you're a

big hero, right?  For fixing

their system.

HARRY

(faintly)

Uh huh.

HELEN

My husband the hero.

HELEN

I'll be right there, honey.  Just

a minute.

HELEN

Just a second.

HELEN

Happy Birthday, Harry.

Abu Kaleem Malik.

GIB

(reading from a file)

Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-                     *

fundamentalist.  Linked to                             *

numerous car-bombings, that cafe                       *

bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of

Lisbon last year.  Major player.                       *

FAISIL                                       *

Now he's formed his own splinter

faction called CRIMSON JIHAD.

GIB                                          *

Guess he thought the other

terrorist groups were too warm

and fuzzy for his taste.

FAISIL

They call him "The Sand Spider".                       *

TRILBY

Why?

FAISIL

(he shrugs)

Probably because it sounds scary.                      *

TRILBY

This is impressive, gentlemen.

Of course, it would have been

even more impressive if you

actually knew where he was.

HARRY

We'll get him.

TRILBY

Yes.  You will.

(meaning-- you damn

well better)

Harry, I still want you in

charge, even though your cover is

blown.  Just keep a low profile.

(he slaps a newspaper

on the table)

I generally prefer it when my

covert operations don't make the

front page.

HARRY

Look, uh... I've got to talk to

Helen about this thing with Dana.

Just hang a minute.

I'll just hang then, shall I?

have told you about him.

You look like you got gut-kicked.

What's the matter?  You sick?

HARRY

(barely audible)

He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen.

It's Helen, Gib.

GIB

Something to do with Helen, is

what I'm getting.

HARRY

She's having an affair.

GIB

Congratulations.  Welcome to the

club.

HARRY

It can't be.  Not Helen.

GIB

Nobody believes it can happen to

them.

HARRY

It can't be.

GIB

Same thing happened to me with

wife two.  I had no idea until I

came home and the house was

empty.  I mean empty.  She even

took the ice-cube trays from the

fridge.  What kind of person

would think of that?

HARRY

(not listening)

I still don't believe it.

GIB

Relax.  Helen still loves you.

She just wants this guy to bang

her.  It's nothing serious.

You'll get used to it after a --

HARRY

STOP.  CHEERING.  ME.  UP.

GIB

What'dya expect Harry?  She's a

flesh and blood woman.  And

you're never there.  It was only

a matter of time.

GIB

I say we concentrate on work.

That's how I always got through

it whenever my life turned to

dogshit.  Let's catch some

terrorists and then you can beat

the crap out of them.  You'll

feel better.

GIB

Women.  Can't live with 'em.

Can't kill 'em.

He's giving us a blank check on                        *

all of Juno's shipping agents,

her clients, and Faisil made up                        *

a list of possible contacts that

Crimson Jihad might have in this

Is this national security stuff

boring you?

HARRY

Put a tap on her phone.

GIB

What're you talking about?  We

have that.

HARRY

Helen's phone.  Her office line

and the line at my house.

Okay .  .  .I have two words to                        *

describe that idea.  In.  Sane.

Unauthorized wiretap is a felony,

pard.

HARRY

Yeah, and we do it twenty times

a day.  Don't give me that crap.

Just put on the taps.  Now.

Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.

HARRY

They said you had to run out.

HELEN

Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They

needed some documents down at the

court house.  I barely made it.

So, a little excitement in an

What is it you want me to do?

SIMON

Not here.  I'll call you and

we'll rendezvous again.

We have to leave separately, so

we aren't seen together.  For

your safety.

HELEN

You'll call me then?

SIMON

Yes.  Now go.

It's a great little bar, Amanda,

you'd love it.  Beirut's a great

place if you know the city.                            *

Listen, this isn't a secure line.

I'll tell you all about it when

I get back tomorrow... if I live.

(pause)

Scared?  Never!  Except of you--

SIMON

coming toward me--

DOUG                                         *

Simon, look out there.  You see

that man?  Notice how he's

looking at the cars.  He's called

a customer.  I know it's been a

while, but do you remember what

you're supposed to do when we

have a customer?

160   EXT. CAR LOT - DAY

SIMON

It wants you too.  Feel it

vibrate?  How about a little

spin?

SIMON

You gotta jump in.  That's rule

number one.  It takes a little

practice, but there's no way

around it.

161   EXT. STREET - DAY

SIMON

See, it's not just the car, it's

a total image.  An identity you

have to go for.  This isn't some

high-tech sports car...  it

doesn't even handle that great.

But that's not the idea, is it.

SIMON

What're we talking about here?

Pussy, right?

HARRY

Absolutely.

SIMON

Well then this is a vital piece

of equipment.  Used properly, it

can change your life.  See, you

cruise.  No racing.  This ain't

a Ferrari.  You check out the

scenery, let the scenery check

you out.  You got to take it

slow.  Old cars are like good

women... they heat up fast.

HARRY

Keep talking.

CUT TO:

162   EXT. TACO STAND - DAY

SIMON

Let's face it, Harry, the Vette

gets 'em wet.  But it's not

enough.  If you want to really

close escrow, you gotta have an

angle.

HARRY

And you've got one.

SIMON

It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm

not that much to look at.  No

really.  I can be honest.  But I

got 'em lining up, and not just

skanks, either.  Some are.

HARRY

So what's your angle?

SIMON

Sorry.  Trade secret.

HARRY

(grinning)

Sure.  Set me up and then don't

tell me.

SIMON

Okay, just ask yourself.  What do

women really want?  You take

these bored housewives, married

to the same guy for years.  Stuck

in a rut.  They need some

release.  The promise of

adventure.  A hint of danger.  I

create that for them.

HARRY

So you're basically lying your

ass off the whole time?  I

couldn't do it.

SIMON

Well, think of it as playing a

role.  It's fantasy.  You have to

work on their dreams.  Get them

out of their daily suburban grind

for a few hours.

HARRY

Isn't that hard to keep up, in

the long run?

SIMON

Doesn't matter.  I like change.

You know, constant turnover.  As

soon as I close the deal, it's

one of two more times, then

adios.

HARRY

Use 'em and lose 'em.

SIMON

Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta

pick your target.  They have to

be nice little housewife types.

School-teachers.  But, I'm

telling you, you get their pilot

lit, these babes, they can suck-

start a leaf-blower.

HARRY

What about the husbands?

SIMON

Dickless.  If they took care of                        *

business, I'd be out of business,

know what I mean?

HARRY

Those idiots.

163   EXT. STREET/ VETTE - DAY

HARRY

You working on someone right now?

SIMON

I always have a couple on the

hook.  You know.  There's one

right now, I've got her panting

like a dog.  It's great.

HARRY

What does she do?

SIMON

Some kinda legal secretary of

something.  Married to some

boring jerk.

SIMON

And she could be so hot, if she

wanted to be.  She's like a dying

plant that just needs a little

water.

HARRY

But with you, she gets to be hot,

right?

SIMON

Red hot.  Her thighs steam.

HARRY

Sooooo... she's pretty good in

bed, then?

SIMON

(yelling suddenly)

Hey, slow down you're gonna miss

the turn!

164   EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY

See.  You and this car were meant

for each other.  Why fight it?

Sure, I have a couple other

HARRY

Let me think about it.  Hold it

it makes you appreciate life.

And the moment.  Because that may

be all you have.

To pull this cover story off, we

have to look exactly like two

people who are intimate with each

easily.

Would you say he was boring,

Yeah.  I suppose he is.

That's none of your goddamn

business!  What kind of questions

are these?

You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs.

Tasker, so I suggest you

cooperate.  If we want to know

But he's not exactly ringing your

bell lately, right?  I mean--

Let me handle this part.  Do you

mind?

Why did you go to Carlos'

hideout?

HELEN

He wanted me to go with him on a

mission, to pose as him wife.

HARRY

And you agreed?

HELEN

Yes.

HARRY

(amazed)

Why?

HELEN

I don't know.  I guess I needed

something...

HARRY

What did you need?

HELEN

I needed to feel alive.  I wanted

to do something...  outrageous.

And... I don't know... it felt

good to be needed.  To be

trusted.  To be special.

HELEN

There's so much I wanted to do in

this life, and it's like I

haven't done any of it.  And the

sand's running out of the

hourglass.  I want to be able to

look back and say:  See!  I did

that.  It was wild and it was

reckless and outrageous and I

fucking did it!

No.

get home to my family.

Oh shit.  Harry... what're you

doing?

HARRY

(like: isn't it

obvious?)

I'm giving her an assignment.

(to Helen)

I am offerring you a choice.  If

you work for us we will drop the

charges and you can go back to

your normal life.  If not, you

will go to federal prison, and

your husband and daughter will be

left humiliated and alone.  Your

like will be destroyed.

Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--

HARRY

Yes or no.

HELEN

What do you think?  Of course

yes!  What's involved?

HARRY

You will be contacted with the

assignment.

HELEN

My husband can't know about this.

HARRY

No one must know!  Especially

him.  You must appear to live

your life normally, conveying

nothing.  The security of this

nation depends on it.  Can you do

that?

HELEN

I think so.

HARRY

Think carefully.  You will be

lying to the man you love.  The

person who trusts you the most.

HELEN

I can do it!

No.  He has particular tastes.

He likes to watch.  You will say

his regular girl, Carla, is sick.

If he likes you, he will tell you

what to do.  You must plant the

HELEN

N-no.

MALIK

So that this man can verify to

HELEN

How can Harry do that?  He's a

MALIK

If we were wrong about him...

This is a Soviet MIRV-Six, from

If I break it they can take it

out of my pay.

(to pilot)

It'll be fine.  He's got hundreds

of hours in Harriers.  Joint-ops,

cross-training and all that.

AGENT

Harry can fly anything.

GIB

He's a little rusty.  It's like

riding a bicycle .  .  .  you

never forget.  Uh .  .  .  I'd

seek shelter!

GIB

He's got it.

HARRY

Sorry.

This is a communique from Crimson

Jihad.  You have heard from your

own expert.  You have seen the

Holy fire with your own eyes.  Do

not force us to destroy this

city.  And do not try to use

force against us.  I can trigger

this bomb instantly.  All I have

to do is turn that key...

(he points fiercely at

the bomb)

... and five million of your

people will die.

REPORTER

What key?

MALIK

(pointing like the

guy's blind)

That key right there!

MALIK

(to his men)

Someone has stolen the key!

reason not to kill you.

MALIK

Come on, child.  Give me the key.

Don't you want to live?  I give

you my word.

No way you whacko.

looked like such a dope.

HARRY

I told the guy---

funny)

I told the guy, this isn't even

my order.

DANA

I'm done.

I seem to remember something
