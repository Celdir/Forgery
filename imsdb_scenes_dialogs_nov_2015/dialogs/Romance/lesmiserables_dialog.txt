BLACK SCREEN

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

The year is 1815.

The French revolution is a distant

memory. Napoleon has been defeated.

France is ruled by a King again.

RISE UP out of the iron-grey surface of the ocean, seething

in the wind, towards the shore. Winter rain slices the air.

Ahead, the port of Toulon, home of the French navy. A forest

of tall masted warships.

The great ships heave at anchor, the wind whipping their

rigging.

Through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships

under construction, and warships being refitted.

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

Toulon

Home port of the French navy

Storm-lashed sea and driving rain. A great wave rises up

and hammers down. As it recedes we see the figures of men

heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over

their faces. The harsh storm light catches glints of metal:

these men are CONVICTS, chained by manacles, heads shaved,

wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched

onto them.

Now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being

hauled ashore - a storm-damaged man-of-war, its masts

broken, rising and falling on the surge.

As yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we

follow the straining ropes down into the base of the

slipway, and find the convict JEAN VALJEAN, up to his waist

in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and

spray and wind scream round him. A great brute of a man, he

seems to feel nothing.

2.

CONVICTS

Ha - Ha -

CONVICT 3

Ha - Ha -

Look down, look down

Don't look them in the eye

CONVICTS

Look down, look down

You're here until you die.

CONVICT 4

No God above

And Hell alone below

CONVICTS

Look down, look down

There's twenty years to go.

CONVICT 2

I've done no wrong

Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!

CONVICTS

Look down, look down

Sweet Jesus doesn't care.

CONVICT 5

I know she'll wait

I know that she'll be true -

CONVICTS

Look down, look down

They've all forgotten you.

CONVICT 1

When I get free

You won't see me

Here for dust!

3.

CONVICTS

Look down, look down

Don't look'em in the eye.

CONVICT 3

How long, O Lord

Before you let me die?

CONVICTS

Look down, look down

You'll always be a slave.

Look down, look down

You're standing in your grave.

JAVERT

Now Prisoner 24601.

Your time is up

And your parole's begun.

You know what that means?

VALJEAN

Yes. It means I'm free.

JAVERT

No! It means you get

Your yellow ticket-of-leave.

JAVERT

This badge of shame

You'll show it everywhere.

It warns you're a dangerous man.

VALJEAN

I stole a loaf of bread

My sister's child was close to

death

And we were starving.

4.

JAVERT

You will starve again

Unless you learn the meaning of

the law.

VALJEAN

I know the meaning of those

nineteen years

A slave of the law!

JAVERT

Five years for what you did,

The rest because you tried to

run.

Yes, 24601!

VALJEAN

My name is Jean Valjean!

JAVERT

And I'm Javert!

Do not forget my name.

Do not forget me -

24601!

He strides away to command the lines of convicts as they're

marched away. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in

that he is free at last.

The convicts sing as he goes.

CONVICTS

Look down, look down

You'll always be a slave.

Look down, look down

You're standing in your grave.

Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on

his back. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and

there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide

vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the

distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. Behind and

below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. As we hear the

musical theme ('Freedom is Mine'), we see for the first

time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope.

VALJEAN

Freedom at last -

How strange the taste!

Never forget the years - the waste,

Nor forgive them for what they've

done.

They are the guilty - Everyone!

The day begins

(more)

5.

VALJEAN (cont'd)

And now lets see

What this new world

Will do for me!

Valjean strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin

coat close round him against the cold winter wind.

He passes a long line of labourers working. He approaches

the OVERSEER.

VALJEAN

Monsieur can I help? A day's work?

The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap.

OVERSEER

Take your hat off.

Valjean takes his hat off, revealing his shaved and scarred

head.

OVERSEER

Passport.

The overseer scans the yellow paper, and hands it back.

OVERSEER

No work here.

Valjean slogs on up the rising track into the mountains.

Snow on the ground here, and darkness falling.

He looks up and sees ahead a village built on a rock cliff,

its lights twinkling, the snowy mountains rising behind.

The tower of its handsome church rises up like a promise of

refuge. This is Digne.

Valjean enters Digne. As he drinks from the fountain, he sees

a guard standing outside the Mairie.

6.

Valjean stands waiting. The officer fastidiously writes down

the name of Valjean in his huge ledger and the name of the

town in his passport. The officer signs and stamps the

passport.

OFFICER

Valjean.

The officer hands back the passport. Valjean leaves.

Valjean walks down the high street, spies the warm glow of an

inn and enters.

Valjean sits in the corner, his hat low over his head. He

eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast

meal by a roaring fire place. The innkeeper serves him a

beer. As he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to

reveal his wrist, calloused and scarred by manacles. The

innkeeper eyes him warily. He discusses Valjean with two

other men, then asks for his paper. Sees the phrase

"Extremely Dangerous".

VALJEAN'S POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeeper's

hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of

refusal.

INNKEEPER

My inn is full.

Valjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes

down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways,

but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure

follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'.

Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a

stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his

heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife

before him, his children on either side. Nothing special,

and yet everything he's never had.

He stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell

hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open.

7.

VALJEAN

Jailer. Would you let me stay here

for tonight?

JAILER

This is a prison, not an inn. Get

yourself arrested. Then we will

open up for you.

The grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some

children who have been following begin throwing stones at

him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter.

He sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret.

Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some

straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an

enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel.

Snow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry,

weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from

where the dog has bitten him.

At the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a

dark churchyard.

Snow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean

collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the

shelter of a doorway.

A lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches,

throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest

on the crumpled figure of Valjean.

He stirs and opens his eyes.

VALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness.

Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The

BISHOP.

BISHOP

Come in, sir, for you are weary

And the night is cold out here.

Though our lives are very humble

What we have we have to share.

Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes

with the Bishop into the house by the church.

8.

A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with

silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room,

illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop

ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's

sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates.

BISHOP

There is wine here to revive you.

There is bread to make you

strong.

There's a bed to rest till

morning -

Rest from pain, and rest from

wrong.

BISHOP

Sit, my brother.

The Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire.

BISHOP

Madame, set one more place.

(to Valjean)

Please sit.

The Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair.

Valjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him.

Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a

short grace.

BISHOP

May the Lord bless the food we eat

today. Bless our dear sister and

our honoured guest.

(To Valjean)

Please, eat. Where are you

travelling to my brother?

VALJEAN

Pontarlier.

BISHOP

Is that where your family is?

VALJEAN

No. The destination is compulsory.

That is where the Law sends me. I

have no home.

BISHOP

Then let this be your home, for

as long as you need it.

9.

The Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are

also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage,

Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom.

There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a

cupboard.

He turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen

waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his

life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him.

BISHOP

Sleep well. Tomorrow morning

before you leave you will have a

cup of milk from our cows, nice

and hot.

The Bishop turns away to go to sleep.

VALJEAN

You let me sleep here next to you?

How do you know I'm not a murderer?

Valjean laughs a strange laugh.

BISHOP

God will take care of that.

LATER THAT NIGHT -

Valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep.

Outside a dog barks.

Valjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the

light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down

on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing

judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and

remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door.

There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to

the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop

lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver

is kept.

Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a

metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor

boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his

breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep.

He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard

door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop,

disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is

over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should

he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and

lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown.

He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is

the silver.

10.

Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last

look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the

door.

Valjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He

crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's

gone.

The Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments

when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean

before him. Valjean hangs his head, unable to meet the

Bishop's eyes.

CONSTABLE

Monsignor, we caught the thief

red-handed! He has the nerve to

say you gave him all this!

He upends Valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out.

The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean.

BISHOP

That is right.

Amazed, Valjean looks up.

BISHOP

But my friend, you left so early,

You forgot I gave these also.

Would you leave the best behind?

The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks.

BISHOP

(to policemen)

Messieurs, release him.

For this man has spoken true.

I commend you for your duty

Now God's blessing go with you.

Silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn

and leave.

Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks.

BISHOP

But remember this, my brother -

See in this some higher plan.

You must use this precious silver

To become an honest man.

By the witness of the martyrs,

(more)

11.

BISHOP (cont'd)

By the passion and the blood,

God has raised you out of

darkness -

I have bought your soul for God.

Valjean kneels in the church.

He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it.

He turns towards the altar, and the crucifix above it.

VALJEAN

What have I done?

Sweet Jesus, what have I done?

Become a thief in the night

Become a dog on the run!

And have I fallen so far

And is the hour so late

That nothing remains but the cry

of my hate?

The cries in the dark that nobody

hears

Here where I stand at the turning

of the years.

If there's another way to go

I missed it twenty long years

ago.

My life was a war that could

never be won.

They gave me a number and

murdered Valjean

When they chained me and left me

for dead

Just for stealing a mouthful of

bread!

Yet why did I allow this man

To touch my soul and teach me

love?

He treated me like any other

He gave me his trust

He called me brother.

My life he claims for God

above...

Can such things be?

For I had come to hate the world -

This world that always hated me!

Take an eye for an eye!

Turn your heart into stone!

This is all I have lived for!

This is all I have known!

One word from him and I'd be back

Beneath the lash, upon the rack.

Instead he offers me my freedom!

(more)

12.

VALJEAN (cont'd)

I feel my shame inside me like a

knife.

He told me that I have a soul...

How does he know?

What spirit comes to move my

life?

Is there another way to go?

Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high,

as if to the altar.

VALJEAN

I am reaching, but I fall

And the night is closing in...

As I stare into the void -

To the whirlpool of my sin.

Valjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the

church.

VALJEAN

I'll escape now from that world -

From the world of Jean Valjean.

Jean Valjean is nothing now!

Valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and

reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. Below lies

the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley

below.

VALJEAN

Another story must begin!

He rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces

out over the valley. The scraps flutter in the wind.

FOLLOW the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind

then fall away into the void below. One scrap of paper

dances upwards in the sunlight. We follow this and

accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne

far below, towards the sun gloriously breaking through the

heavens with the alps beyond. The camera then starts to

tumble back down through mist and cloud below - through

time and space - down to discover -

The camera hurtling towards three horses riding down a long

muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of

Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out

to the sea. We see ships sitting in low tide on the mud of

the estuary along the dockside of the town, and red brick

factory buildings.

13.

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

Eight years later

Montreuil-sur-Mer, 1823.

The camera closes in to ground level to reveal the

horseriders:

Javert, flanked by two policemen.

As the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered

around the gates - destitute and sick people clammering to

get in.

BEGGARS' CHORUS

At the end of the day you're

another day older

And that's all you can say for

the life of the poor.

It's a struggle! It's a war!

And there's nothing that anyone's

giving.

One more day standing about -

What is it for?

One day less to be living.

Javert sees the destitution of the people. Expressionless

as ever.

BEGGARS' CHORUS

At the end of the day you're

another day colder

And the shirt on your back

doesn't keep out the chill.

And the righteous hurry past

They don't hear the little ones

crying

And the plague is coming on fast

Ready to kill -

One day nearer to dying!

TRACK PAST a plague victim, wrapped in a shroud, being thrown

onto a cart.

The police enter the harbour.

The beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for

the police.

14.

BEGGARS' CHORUS

At the end of the day there's

another day dawning

And the sun in the morning is

waiting to rise

Like the waves crash on the sand

Like a storm that'll break any

second

There's a hunger in the land

There's a reckoning still to be

reckoned

And there's gonna be hell to pay

At the end of the day!

Javert looks round at the factory buildings, the boats in

the harbour, the poor clamouring behind him, and rides on.

Heavy carts wait to be loaded with wooden crates of goods.

Workmen carry the crates out of the factory as the FOREMAN

strides in through the doors, gesturing to a cart driver,

FAUCHELEVENT, who's taking a quick rest on a crate.

The foreman passes men packing boxes on tables and loading

boxes onto crates. He passes through a door under a first

floor office.

The long work space is full of tables at which

conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry

out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet. An

impressive sight: obviously a very successful business. A

wooden staircase climbs one wall to a glass-windowed

business office. The figure of a man within.

FOREMAN

(flirtatiously, to women)

At the end of the day you get

nothing for nothing!

Sitting flat on your bum doesn't

buy any bread!

FACTORY WOMAN 4

There are children back at home -

FACTORY WOMAN 2

And the children have got to be

fed.

15.

FACTORY WOMAN 7

And you're lucky to be in a job -

FOREMAN

(quietly, to Fantine)

And in a bed!

FACTORY WOMAN 8

(to Fantine, as a warning)

And we're counting our blessings!

FOREMAN

At the end of the day just be glad

to be working

For a master who cares for the

lives of the poor.

FACTORY WOMAN 7

He's a riddle..

FACTORY WOMAN 4

He's no fool..

FACTORY WOMAN 6

He's the answer to anyone's prayer

FACTORY WOMAN 8

And he paid for the brand new

school

FACTORY WOMAN 4

It's no wonder they made him the

mayor!

FACTORY WOMEN

Bless the man who leads the way!

At the end of the day!

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN

Have you seen how the foreman is

fuming today

With his terrible breath and his

wandering hands?

16.

FACTORY WOMAN 3

It's because little Fantine won't

give him his way.

FACTORY WOMAN 5

Take a look at his trousers,

you'll see where he stands!

FACTORY WOMAN 2

And the boss, he never knows

That the foreman is always on

heat.

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN

If Fantine doesn't look out,

Watch how she goes,

She'll be out on the street!

FACTORY WOMEN/FOREMAN

At the end of the day its another

day over

With enough in your pocket to last

for a week

Pay the landlord, pay the shop

Keep on working as long as you're

able

Keep on working till you drop

Or it's back to the crumbs off the

table

Well, you've got to pay your way

At the end of the day!

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN

And what have we here, little

innocent sister?

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN

Come on, Fantine, let's have all

the news.

(reading)

`Dear Fantine, you must send us

more money,

Your child needs a doctor,

There's no time to lose.'

17.

FANTINE

Give that letter to me

It is none of your business.

With a husband at home

And a bit on the side!

Is there anyone here

Who can swear before God

She has nothing to fear?

She has nothing to hide?

VALJEAN

What is this fighting all about?

Will someone tear these two

apart?

This is a factory, not a circus.

VALJEAN

Now come on, ladies, settle down.

I run a business of repute.

VALJEAN

(to the foreman)

Deal with this, Foreman.

Be as patient as you can.

FOREMAN

Now someone say how this began!

FANTINE/FACTORY WOMAN 5

At the end of the day she's the

one who began it!

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN

There's a kid that she's hiding

in some little town.

FACTORY WOMAN 5

There's a man she has to pay

18.

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN

You can guess how she picks up

the extra -

You can bet she's earning her

keep

Sleeping around!

And the boss wouldn't like it.

FANTINE

Yes, it's true there's a child

And the child is my daughter

And her father abandoned us,

Leaving us flat.

Now she lives with an innkeeper

man and his wife

And I pay for the child.

What's the matter with that?

FACTORY WOMEN

At the end of the day she'll be

nothing but trouble

And there's trouble for all when

there's trouble for one!

While we're earning our daily

bread

She's the one with her hands in

the butter -

You must send the slut away

Or we're all going to end in the

gutter

And it's us who'll have to pay

At the end of the day!

FOREMAN

I might have known the bitch

could bite!

I might have known the cat had

claws!

I might have guessed your little

secret!

Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine

Who keeps herself so pure and

clean -

You'd be the cause, I had no

doubt

Of any trouble hereabout.

You play a virgin in the light

But need no urging in the night!

MAIN FACTORY WOMAN

She's been laughing at you

While she's having her men!

19.

FACTORY WOMEN

She'll be nothing but trouble

again and again!

FACTORY WOMAN 5

You must sack her today!

FACTORY WOMEN

Sack the girl today!

FOREMAN

Right, my girl! On your way!

Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office

above with a pitiful cry.

FANTINE

M'sieur Mayor, help me! I have a

child!

Valjean hears the cry, but he has other concerns. He turns

round to face Javert.

Javert stares at him.

On the factory floor below, the Foreman hustles Fantine

out, as she struggles against him.

Javert bows.

JAVERT

I introduce myself,

Inspector of Police.

I've come to take the watch

I'm here to keep the peace.

Please know me as Javert.

I'm here at your command

With honour due to each.

With justice in our hands

No man's beyond our reach.

Let all beware.

VALJEAN

Welcome, sir

Come guard our laws

I'm sure we're here

In common cause.

Javert turns to look through the high window onto the men's

factory floor below. The last men are leaving for the day.

JAVERT

You've done the city proud,

You've raised their banner high.

(more)

20.

JAVERT (cont'd)

You manufacture gems

That anyone can buy

Your people thrive.

Valjean shows some demonstration samples of their work.

VALJEAN

The dignity of toil

To stay alive.

Javert is puzzled. He's sure he recognises Valjean, but

from where?

JAVERT

It seems to me

We may have met.

Valjean throws him a sharp glance.

VALJEAN

Your face is not a face

I would forget.

A CRASH from outside in the yard - shouts -

Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and

down the muddy track beyond to discover -

A heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver -

Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a

crate.

The   cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart

off   the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is

too   soft. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in

the   mud.

Valjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help,

but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground.

All the time the cart is sinking further, pushing

Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him.

Then Valjean sees a way. At one end the wheels of the cart

have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. He throws

himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces

himself to lift it from beneath.

VALJEAN

Get back! It may fall!

FOREMAN

No, Monsieur le Mayor!

CROWD

It'll kill you as well!

21.

JAVERT

Can this be true?

I don't believe what I see!

A man your age

To be as strong as you are!

A memory stirs...

You make me think of a man

From years ago

A man who broke his parole..

He disappeared.

JAVERT

Forgive me, sir.

I would not dare -

VALJEAN

Say what you must.

Don't leave it there.

VALJEAN

Let me help you up.

FAUCHELEVENT

Monsieur le Mayor, you come from

God!

You are a saint!

VALJEAN

No more cart driving for you!

22.

Javert stares. He can't rid himself of his suspicion.

JAVERT

Monsieur le Mayor.

He draws himself up and gives a bow. As he walks away, he

discusses something with his assistant.

Fantine makes her way to the harbour wall. Beggars shelter in

the tunnels under the red brick buildings.

Fantine makes her way down   wet slimy steps. This leads to an

alleyway that runs down to   the harbour and three ships lying

on the mud at low tide. At   the far end, the largest is the

rotting hulk of a vast old   warship. A single whore sits in a

doorway.

FANTINE

Excuse me, is this where the

Pawnbrokers is?

WHORE 1

(pointing)

It's just there.

FANTINE

Thank you.

Drunken sailors spill out into the alleyway below. The

first sailor is trying to find the whorehouse.

SAILOR 1

I smell women!

Smell'em in the air!

Think I'll drop my anchor

In that harbour over there!

They spot Fantine, mistaking her for a whore. Fantine presses

on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors.

SAILOR 2

Lovely ladies!

Love `em till your broke!

Seven months at sea can make you

Hungry for a poke!

The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows

of warehouse doorways.

SAILOR 3

Even stokers need a little stoke!

23.

WHORES                         TOOTH MAN

wall!

PAWNBROKER

Hello sweetheart, I'll give you

four francs.

FANTINE

It's worth at least ten.

FANTINE

Alright, five.

HAIR CRONE

What pretty hair!

What pretty locks you've got

there!

What luck you got.

It's worth a centime, my dear!

I'll take the lot!

FANTINE

Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

HAIR CRONE

Let's make a price.

I'll give you all of ten francs.

Just think of that!

24.

FANTINE

It pays a debt...

HAIR CRONE

Just think of that.

FANTINE

What can I do? It pays a debt.

Ten francs may save my poor

Cosette.

The hair crone leads Fantine down to her shop at the base of

the stairs.

Fantine is sat on a low stool. She bows her head before the

hair crone, who at once whips out a razor blade and cuts

off her hair at the roots.

Fantine walks down the steps with short hair, mocked by the

voices of the whores on either side.

A PIMP and the HEAD WHORE watch her progress as the organ-

grinder grinds out the music.

Whores sing from the warehouse doorways, from on top of the

spars of the ships, writhing around figureheads and from the

rotting ship.

The few men in the street choose their whores and disappear

by the end of the chorus.

WHORES                          TOOTH MAN

Lovely ladies                     Lovely dentures guaranteed to

Waiting in the dark.              bite

Ready for a thick one             They clean up real easy

Or a quick one in the park.       You can take them out at

night

HEAD WHORE                 Lovely teeth dear shining

Long time, short time             like the stars

Anytime my dear!                  I'll whip em out quite

Cost a little extra               quickly

If you want to take all year      And I won't leave any scars.

WHORES

Quick and cheap is underneath

the pier

Fantine reaches the hair crone.

FANTINE

Please, you wouldn't have any work

for me would you? Please, I sold

you my hair. I could do anything.

The hair crone points at the head whore and the tooth man.

25.

HAIR CRONE

Go and see them.

Fantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore.

TOOTH MAN                        HEAD WHORE

Come over here,                   Come here my dear.

I'll pay well for your youth.

I pay ten francs for a tooth.

Fantine heads to the tooth man.

TOOTH MAN

You have, my dear,

The clear advantage of youth.

HEAD WHORE

(whispers)

Just the back ones.

TOOTH MAN

The pain won't last,

You'll still be able to bite.

She grabs Fantine's cheeks and forces open her mouth to

inspect her teeth.

TOOTH MAN

I do it fast,

I know my business all right.

It's worth a go.

The pimp pushes her down.

FANTINE

You'll pay me first

What I am due.

TOOTH MAN

You'll get twice

If I take two!

She opens her mouth, and the pincers go in, as everyone

gathers round to watch. Fantine screams as the first tooth

is removed.

The pimp is passing among the whores, checking that they're

all fit for business.

WHORES

God, we're weary,

Sick enough to drop!

LOVELY LADY 1

Belly burns like fire,

Will the bleeding ever stop!

26.

PIMP

Cheer up, deary!

Show a happy face!

Plenty more like you here

If you can't keep up the pace.

LOVELY LADY 1

Only joking!

Deary knows her place!

PIMP

Gimme the dirt -

Who's that bit over there?

WHORE 1

A bit of skirt,

She's the one sold her hair.

HEAD WHORE

She's got a kid,

Sends her all that she can.

PIMP

I might've known

There is always some man.

PIMP

Lovely lady, come along and join

us!

Lovely lady!

WHORE 1

Come on, dearie, why all the

fuss?

WHORES

... why all the fuss.

WHORE 2

You're no grander than the rest

of us.

WHORES

... than the rest of us.

27.

WHORE 3

Life has dropped you at the

bottom of the heap.

WHORES

...at the bottom of the heap.

HEAD WHORE

Join your sisters -

WHORE 1

Make money in your sleep!

WHORES

... make money in your sleep.

WHORE 2

That's right, dearie,

Show him what you've got!

WHORES

... show him what you've got.

WHORE 3

That's right, dearie,

Let him have the lot!

WHORES

...let him have the lot.

WHORES

Old men, young men, take'em as

they come!

Harbour rats and alley cats

And every kind of scum!

Poor men, rich men, leaders of

the land -

See them with their trousers off,

They're never quite as grand!

All it takes is money in your

hand!

WHORES

Lovely ladies

Going for a song,

(more)

28.

WHORES (cont'd)

Got a lot of callers

But they never stay for long...

Fantine puts on a show of courage as she leads the captain

into the ship's hulk, which is a brothel.

FANTINE

Come on, Captain, you can wear your

shoes.

Don't it make a change to have a

girl who can't refuse?

Fantine, pale and frail, her bodice loosened, leads the

captain down to the damp dregs of the ship.

We see the rotting straw mattress within as they enter,

then Fantine lays down.

FANTINE

Easy money lying on a bed.

Just as well they never see

The hate that's in your head!

Don't they know they're making love

To one already dead?

CLOSE ON a man's hand leaving money. We hear him exit. MOVE

TO FIND Fantine lying alone on the mattress.

She pulls herself into a sitting position against the head

of the mattress. She draws her legs up and wraps her arms

round her knees, huddling against the misery of the world.

FANTINE

There was a time when men were

kind,

When their voices were soft

And their words inviting.

There was a time when love was

blind

And the world was a song

And the song was exciting.

There was a time...

Then it all went wrong.

I dreamed a dream in time gone

by,

When hope was high

And life worth living.

I dreamed that love would never

die.

I dreamed that God would be

forgiving.

(more)

29.

FANTINE (cont'd)

Then I was young and unafraid

And dreams were made and used and

wasted.

There was no ransom to be paid,

No song unsung, no wine untasted.

But the tigers come at night

With their voices soft as thunder

As they tear your hope apart

As they turn your dream to shame.

He slept a summer by my side,

He filled my days with endless

wonder.

He took my childhood in his

stride

But he was gone when autumn came.

And still I dream he'll come to

me!

That we will live the years

together...

But there are dreams that cannot

be

And there are storms we cannot

weather...

I had a dream my life would be

So different from this hell I'm

living -

So different now from what it

seemed!

Now life has killed the dream I

dreamed.

As she ends her song, her next customer is waiting. The head

whore beyond.

Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside,

shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly,

but still attempts an alluring smile.

She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits,

trying pathetically to attract custom. Then she comes to a

stop, staring. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some

way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to

a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money.

As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well-

dressed young man, BAMATABOIS, comes up to her. He arrives

with two friends and a valet.

30.

BAMATABOIS

Here's something new. I think

I'll give it a try.

Come closer, you! I like to see

what I buy.

The usual price

For just one slice of your pie.

FANTINE

I don't want you! No! No,

M'sieur! Let me go!

BAMATABOIS

Is this a trick? I won't pay

more!

FANTINE

No, not at all!

BAMATABOIS

You've got some nerve, you little

slut!

You've got some gall!

It's the same with a tart as it is

with a grocer

The customer sees what he gets in

advance

It's not for the whore to say "yes

sir" or "no sir"

It's not for the harlot to pick and

to choose or to lead me a dance!

FANTINE

I'll kill you, you bastard!

Try any of that!

Even a whore who has gone to the

bad

Won't be had by a rat!

BAMATABOIS

(furious but aroused)

By Christ you'll pay for what

you've done!

This rat will make you bleed,

you'll see!

I guarantee I'll make you suffer!

For this disturbance of the peace

For this insult to life and

property!

31.

FANTINE

I beg you, don't report me, sir.

I'll do whatever you may want.

BAMATABOIS

Make your excuse to the police!

JAVERT

Tell me quickly what's the story.

Who saw what and why and where?

Let him give a full description,

Let him answer to Javert!

In this nest of whores and vipers

Let one speak who saw it all.

Who laid hands on this good man

here?

What's the substance of this

brawl?

BAMATABOIS

Javert, would you believe it?

I was walking, it was dark

When this prostitute attacked me

You can see she's left her mark!

JAVERT

She will answer for her actions

When you make a full report.

You may rest assured, M'sieur,

That she will answer to the

court.

FANTINE

There's a child who sorely needs

me,

Please, m'sieur, she's but that

high.

Holy God, is there no mercy?

If I go to jail she'll die.

JAVERT

I have heard such protestations

Every day for twenty years.

Let's have no more explanations,

(more)

32.

JAVERT (cont'd)

Save your breath and save your

tears.

VALJEAN

A moment of your time, Javert.

I do believe this woman's tale.

JAVERT

Monsieur le Mayor!

VALJEAN

You've done your duty. Let her

be.

She needs a doctor, not a jail.

JAVERT

Monsieur le Mayor!

FANTINE

Can this be?

VALJEAN

Where will she end -

This child without a friend?

VALJEAN

I've seen your face before.

Show me some way to help you.

How have you come to grief

In such a place as this?

FANTINE

M'sieur, don't mock me now, I

pray

It's hard enough I've lost my

pride.

You let your foreman send me

away.

Yes, you were there

And turned aside.

I never did no wrong.

VALJEAN

Is it true what I've done -

FANTINE

My daughter's close to dying.

33.

VALJEAN

- to an innocent soul?

FANTINE

If there's a God above -

VALJEAN

Had I only known then!

FANTINE

He'd let me die instead.

VALJEAN

In His name my task has just begun.

I will her to the hospital.

Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms.

Javert is quietly coldly furious.

JAVERT

Monsieur le Mayor!

FANTINE

Bring Cosette back to me.

VALJEAN

Where is she?

FANTINE

At an inn in Montfermeil...

JAVERT

Monsieur le Mayor!

VALJEAN

I will see it done! I will send

for her immediately!

As Valjean and Fantine move away, Javert stares after them,

then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow

after them.

As Javert walks up the steps to his police station his

assistant stops him with an urgent letter.

JAVERT'S ASSISTANT

From Paris, Monsieur.

Javert seizes it, opens it, and reads. As he reads, his

expression changes. Appalled, he realizes he's made a

terrible mistake.

34.

Valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his

papers once everyone else has gone, when Javert enters and

stands before him. He looks up.

JAVERT

Monsieur le Mayor

I have a crime to declare!

I have disgraced

The uniform that I wear.

I've done you wrong,

Let no forgiveness be shown.

I've been as hard

On every rogue I have known.

I'll bear the blame,

I must be treated

Just the same.

VALJEAN

I don't understand.

What is this crime, Javert?

JAVERT

I mistook you for a convict,

I have made a false report.

Now I learn they've caught the

culprit -

He's about to face the court.

Valjean conceals his shock.

JAVERT

And of course the thief denies

it,

You'd expect that from a con.

But he couldn't run for ever,

No, not even Jean Valjean.

VALJEAN

You say this man denies it all,

And gives no sign of

understanding or repentance?

You say this man is going to

trial,

And that he's sure to be returned

to serve his sentence?

JAVERT

He will pay, and so must I.

Press charges against me, sir!

VALJEAN

You have only done your duty

It's a minor sin at most.

All of us have been mistaken

You'll return, sir, to your post.

35.

JAVERT

Must I do as you say?

VALJEAN

It's your duty to obey!

Javert is about to protest again, but Valjean raises one

commanding hand, to indicate his decision is made. Javert

gives an abrupt bow, and departs.

Left alone, Valjean paces his office, deeply disturbed.

VALJEAN

They think that man is me -

Without a second glance.

This stranger they have found -

This man could be my chance!

Why should I save his hide?

Why should I right this wrong?

When I have come so far

And struggled for so long?

If I speak I am condemned.

If I stay silent, I am damned!

He goes out onto the balcony that looks down on the empty

factory.

VALJEAN

I am the master of hundreds of

workers -

They all look to me.

Can I abandon them?

How would they live

If I am not free?

If I speak they are condemned.

If I stay silent, I am damned!

Valjean is sitting staring at the Bishop's candlesticks.

Who am I?

Can I condemn this man to

slavery?

Pretend I do not feel his agony?

This innocent who bears my face,

Who goes to judgement in my

place...

Who am I?

Valjean is furiously packing stuff up.

36.

VALJEAN

Can I conceal myself for ever

more?

Pretend I'm not the man I was

before?

And must my name until I die

Be no more than an alibi?

Close on two horses panting. A stopped carriage in a wide

night landscape. The driver is Valjean, hesitating.

Must I lie?

How can I ever face my fellow

men?

How can I ever face myself again?

Valjean hesitates outside the courtroom and in the lobby of

the courtroom, pacing back and forth.

VALJEAN

My soul belongs to God, I know,

I made that bargain long ago.

He gave me hope when hope was

gone!

He gave me strength to journey

on!

Who am I?

Who am I?

I'm Jean Valjean!

Valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the

courtroom.

The man accused of being Jean Valjean, a wretched down-and-

out, stands before the JUDGE. He looks uncannily like the

real Valjean. Before the judge has a chance to speak, the

doors open and Valjean bursts in. Sensation in the court.

VALJEAN

And so, your honour, you see it's

true

That man bears no more guilt than

you!

Who am I?

24601!

37.

The judge is too stunned to respond. The others in the

court can't believe what they've just heard. The Mayor of

Montreuil-sur-Mer, a convict!

VALJEAN

If you don't believe me ask

Inspector Javert. He knows where to

find me.

The judge goes over to Valjean and gently leads him out.

JUDGE

Monsieur le Mayor, you are not

well, you must come with me, do you

have a carriage outside? Monsieur

le Mayor, we must get you home to

bed immediately!!

The hospital is in the long attic of Valjean's factory.

Valjean hurries into the hospital, breathless. He sees a

nursing sister outside Fantine's room.

VALJEAN

Is her daughter with her?

NURSE

No, monsieur. Her guardian sent

this.

She gives Valjean a note. He reads it with mounting anger.

VALJEAN

`Money not enough. Send more.

Thenardier.' What sort of man is

this?

Fantine lies in bed, delirious. She is dressed in pure

white. Her eyes are closed.

FANTINE

Cosette, it's turned so cold!

Cosette, it's past your bedtime!

You've played the day away

And soon it will be night.

Fantine's eyes open and she sees Cosette, playing in the

room. She looks healthy and is dressed prettily.

Come to me, Cosette, the light is

fading.

(more)

38.

FANTINE (cont'd)

Don't you see, the evening star

appearing?

Come to me, and rest against my

shoulder,

How fast the minutes fly away and

every minute colder?

VALJEAN

Dear Fantine, Cosette will be

here soon!

Dear Fantine, she will be by your

side

FANTINE

(trying to get out of bed)

Come Cosette, the night has grown

so cold!

VALJEAN

(putting her back in bed)

Be at peace! Be at peace ever

more.

FANTINE

My Cosette -

VALJEAN

- shall live in my protection.

FANTINE

Take her now!

VALJEAN

Your child will want for nothing.

FANTINE

Good m'sieur, you come from God

in heaven.

VALJEAN

And none shall ever harm Cosette

as long as I am living.

FANTINE

Take my hand...

The night grows ever colder.

39.

VALJEAN

Then I will keep you warm.

FANTINE

Take my child

I give her to your keeping.

VALJEAN

Take shelter from the storm.

FANTINE

For God's sake, please stay till

I am sleeping...

And tell Cosette I love her

And I'll see her when I wake...

JAVERT

Valjean, at last

We see each other plain!

`M'sieur le Mayor'

You'll wear a different chain!

VALJEAN

Before you say another word,

Javert,

Before you chain me up like a

slave again,

Listen to me! There is something

I must do.

This woman leaves behind a

suffering child.

There is none but me who can

intercede -

In mercy's name, three days are

all I need,

Then I'll return, I pledge my

word!

Then I'll return...

JAVERT

You must think me mad!

I've hunted you across the years.

Men like you can never change -

A man such as you!

40.

VALJEAN

Believe of me what you will

There is a duty that I'm sworn to

do.

You know nothing of my life -

All I did was steal some bread.

You know nothing of the world -

You would sooner see me dead.

But not before I see this justice

done!

JAVERT

Men like me can never change.

Men like you can never change.

No, 24601!

My duty is to the law.

You have no rights.

Come with me, 24601!

VALJEAN

I am warning you, Javert,

I'm a stronger man by far!

There is power in me yet!

My race is not yet run!

JAVERT

Now the wheel has turned around -

Jean Valjean is nothing now.

Dare you talk to me of crime

And the price you had to pay.

Every man is born in sin

Every man must choose his way.

You know nothing of Javert!

I was born inside a jail.

I was born with scum like you.

I am from the gutter too.

41.

Javert stares into the black sea - there is no sign of

Valjean.

Javert and various police search the harbourside with

lanterns.

Valjean, dripping wet, watches from a tunnel under a factory,

as Fantine's body wrapped in a shroud is dumped on a cart.

They sing to themselves, continuing their duet without

knowing.

VALJEAN

And this I swear to you tonight -

JAVERT

There is no place for you to

hide.

VALJEAN

Your child will live within my

care -

JAVERT

Wherever you may hide away -

VALJEAN

And I will raise her to the

light.

JAVERT/VALJEAN

I swear to you, I will be there!

The village street is bright with booths set up for a Frost

Fair. Families and visitors are out buying baubles, or

laughing at the antics of travelling players. Small girls

cluster round a stall that displays prettily-dressed dolls.

Amongst them is a prettily-dressed girl of 8 or 9 years:

EPONINE.

Across the road from this stall stands a shabby inn. A

sign lashed to an old cart swinging in the wind reveals the

inn to be `The Sergeant of Waterloo'. The inn is still

closed despite the small crowd at the fair.

MOVE IN on the frosted window of the inn, through which we

see a little girl, COSETTE, gazing out at the display of

dolls.

42.

Cosette is in the process of sweeping the floor. She's come

to a stop, gazing out of the window, mesmerized by the

sight of the most beautiful doll in the display, and

jealous that Eponine can see it and touch it up close.

COSETTE

There is a castle on a cloud

I like to go there in my sleep.

Aren't any floors for me to

sweep,

Not in my castle on a cloud.

Cosette gets out from a hiding place in the wall a knotted

grimy rag - this is her "doll", the knot is the doll's head.

There is a lady all in white

Holds me and sings a lullaby.

She's nice to see and she's soft to

touch

(holding doll to her ear

and whispering)

She says, Cosette, I love you

very much.

I know   a place where no one's

lost

I know   a place where no one

cries.

Crying   at all is not allowed,

Not in   my castle on a cloud.

Madame Thenardier comes bustling down the stairs in a bad

mood. She glowers at little Cosette and changes the closed

sign from "closed" to "open".

MADAME THENARDIER

Now look who's here!

The little madam herself,

Pretending once again

She's been so awfully good!

Better not let me catch you

slacking!

Better not catch my eye!

Ten rotten francs your mother

sends me -

What is that going to buy?

Now take that pail,

My little Mademoiselle,

And go and draw some water from

the well.

We should never have taken you in

In the first place -

How stupid the things that we do!

Like mother, like daughter, the

scum of the street.

43.

MADAME THENARDIER

Eponine, come my dear.

Eponine, let me see you.

You look very well in that little

blue hat!

There's some little girls who

know how to behave

And they know what to wear

And I'm saying thank heaven for

that!

MADAME THENARDIER

Still there, Cosette?

Your tears will do you no good!

I told you to fetch some water

from the well in the wood.

COSETTE

(singing through the gap)

Please do not send me out alone.

Not in the darkness on my own.

MADAME THENARDIER

(singing through the gap)

Enough of that, or I'll forget to

be nice!

You heard me ask for something,

And I never ask twice!

CUSTOMER 1

Mine host Thenardier

He was there, so they say,

At the field of Waterloo.

CUSTOMER 2

Got there, it's true,

When the fight was all through

But he knew just what to do.

CUSTOMER 3

Crawling through the mud,

So I've heard it said,

(more)

44.

CUSTOMER 3 (cont'd)

Picking through the pockets of

the English dead.

CUSTOMER 4

He made a tidy score from the

spoils of war.

We suddenly hear the voice of the landlord, Thenardier. He

has been there all the time, asleep on a bench. He wakes

from his drunken slumbers and roars out:

THENARDIER

My band of soaks,

My den of dissolutes,

My dirty jokes, my always pissed

as newts,

My sons of whores,

Spend their lives in my inn!

Homing pigeons homing in -

They fly through my doors,

And their money's as good as

yours!

Madame Thenardier is trying to sell something unappealing

from her stall to a portly looking man when slushy snow

from the stall's roof falls on the man's head. Madame

Thenardier ushers him inside.

THENARDIER

Welcome, m'sieur!

Sit yourself down

And meet the best

Innkeeper in town!

Madame Thenardier pretends to accidentally drop a comb from

her hair and the customer helpfully picks it up, allowing

Madame Thenardier to pick his wallet from a back pocket as

he stands up. Monsieur Thenardier takes his coat which

allows the couple to see the customer transfer a pocket

watch from coat to jacket pocket.

THENARDIER

As for the rest -

All of them crooks

Rooking the guests

And cooking the books.

Seldom do you see

Honest men like me

A gent of good intent

Who's content to be -

He pours a strong drink for the new customer -

45.

THENARDIER

Master of the house!

Doling out the charm

Ready with a handshake

And an open palm

Thenardier has thieved the pocket watch using his handshake

as a distraction. He passes this off to Madame Thenardier.

THENARDIER

Tells a saucy tale

Makes a little stir

Customers appreciate a bon-viveur

Glad to do a friend a favour

Doesn't cost me to be nice

But nothing gets you nothing

Everything has got a little

price!

THENARDIER

Master of the house!

Keeper of the zoo!

Ready to relieve'em

Of a sou or two -

(serving wine)

Watering the wine

Thenardier is pissing into the very wine bottle he's using to

serve the customer.

THENARDIER

Making up the weight

Picking up their knick-knacks

When they can't see straight

Everybody loves a landlord

Everybody's bosom friend!

I do whatever pleases -

Jesus! Won't I bleed'em in the

end!

At Madame Thenardier's stall, a frost fair customer is

covered by snow, only this time we realise Madame Thenardier

is responsible for pushing the snow off the awning with a

stick.

THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS

Master of the house!

Quick to catch your eye

(more)

46.

THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS (cont'd)

Never wants a passer-by

To pass him by!

Madame Thenardier ushers the customer inside.

Again Madame Thenardier drops her comb in front of the new

customer but this time the thieving is foiled by little

Cosette who helpfully picks it up. Over the chorus she shouts

at little Cosette to get out.

THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS

Servant to the poor

Butler to the great

Comforter, philosopher and

lifelong mate

Everybody's boon companion

Everybody's chaperone -

THENARDIER

But lock up your valises -

Jesus! Won't I skin you to the

bone!

A FAMILY enters the inn. Thenardier fusses over them.

THENARDIER

Enter, messieurs!

Lay down yer load

Unlace yer boots

And rest from the road.

This weighs a ton

Travel's a curse

But here we strive

To lighten your purse.

He's got the father's purse out, and is removing notes.

THENARDIER

Here the goose is cooked

Here the fat is fried

And nothing's overlooked

Till I'm satisfied -

Food beyond compare

Food beyond belief

Thenardier shows off the secrets of the squalid kitchen -

every possible animal being used to make mince meat.

THENARDIER V/O

Mix it in a mincer

And pretend it's beef

Kidney of a horse

(more)

47.

THENARDIER V/O (cont'd)

Liver of a cat

Filling up the sausages

With this and that!

Thenardier serves the disgusting food that we've seen him

create in the flashback to the family.

THENARDIER

Residents are more than welcome

Bridal suite is occupied

A groom and bride consummate their union.

Thenardier is going through the groom's trousers.

THENARDIER V/O

Reasonable charges

Plus some little extras on the

side.

THENARDIER

Charge'em for the lice

Extra for the mice

Two percent for looking in the

mirror twice.

Here a little slice

There a little cut

Three percent for sleeping with

the window shut.

When it comes to fixing prices

There are lots of tricks he knows

How it all increases

All those bits and pieces -

Jesus! It's amazing how it grows.

Thenardier comes out of the inn, backed by a posse of his

gang of loyal customers, and takes control of a brass band to

sing to the Frost Fair.

THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS

Master of the house!

Quick to catch your eye

Never wants a passer-by

To pass him by!

48.

Further down the street, carrying her empty buckets, Cosette

turns to look sadly back at the cheery sight.

THENARDIER

Servant to the poor

Butler to the great

Comforter, philosopher and

lifelong mate

Everybody's boon companion

Gives'em everything he's got -

The Portly Customer has discovered he's been robbed. He

comes out to protest, holding out his emptied wallet. At

once two of Thenardier's thugs grab him and hustle him off.

THENARDIER

Dirty bunch of geezers

Jesus! What a sorry little lot!

Madame Thenardier approaches a handsome soldier who is

drinking at a table by the fire in the inn. She sits on his

lap and gets him to look back at Thenardier, so allowing her

to see inside his coat and spot his wallet.

MADAME THENARDIER

I used to dream

That I would meet a prince

But God almighty

Have you seen what's happened

since?

`Master of the house'

Isn't worth my spit!

Comforter, philosopher

And lifelong shit!

Cunning little brain

Regular Voltaire

Thinks he's quite a lover

But there's not much there.

As Madame Thenardier reaches for the man's groin, she lifts

his wallet skillfully and hands it off to Monsieur

Thenardier.

THENARDIER

What a cruel trick of nature

Landed me with such a louse.

God knows how I've lasted

Living with this bastard in the

house!

She pulls the young man into a dance, enabling her to steal

everything else of value he has. Father Christmas has also

been lured from the frost fair and the Thenardiers slit his

presents sack and exchange it for a sack containing snow.

49.

THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS

Master of the house!

MADAME THENARDIER

Master and a half!

THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS

Comforter, philosopher -

MADAME THENARDIER

Don't make me laugh!

THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS

Servant to the poor

Butler to the great -

MADAME THENARDIER

Hypocrite and toady

And inebriate!

THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS

Everybody bless the landlord!

Everybody bless his spouse!

THENARDIER

Everybody raise a glass!

MADAME THENARDIER

Raise it up the master's arse!

THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS

Everybody raise a glass to the

master of the house!

Cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood, and

is now heading back. Through the dark trees ahead we glimpse

the cheerful lights of the Frost Fair and the distant inn.

She goes slowly, because the buckets are heavy. She hums to

herself to keep her spirits up, a wordless verse of `Castle

on a Cloud'.

After a few steps she pauses to rest the weight of the

buckets.

Strong arms reach for the buckets and lift them out of her

hands. She looks up, amazed. There's Valjean.

VALJEAN

Hush now, do not be afraid of me.

Don't cry. Show me where you live.

(more)

50.

VALJEAN (cont'd)

Tell me, my child, what is your

name?

COSETTE

I'm called Cosette.

VALJEAN

Cosette?

She gazes up at him. Hardly knowing why, the little girl

trusts this stranger. Valjean picks up the heavy buckets, and

they head back towards the inn. As they go, they hum `Castle

on a Cloud' together.

Valjean enters with Cosette. Madame Thenardier hurries

over. Madame and Monsieur Thenardier try to thieve from

Valjean using the same tricks established earlier, but he

evades every attempt. Eponine watches silently from a

corner.

VALJEAN

I found her wandering in the wood

This little child, I found her

trembling in the shadows.

And I am here to help Cosette,

And I will settle any debt you

may think proper.

I will pay what I must pay

To take Cosette away.

This is a duty I must heed.

There is a promise I have made.

For I was blind to one in need,

I did not see what stood before

me.

Now your mother is with God.

Her suffering is over,

And I speak here with her voice,

And I stand here in her place,

and from this day, and ever more -

MADAME THENARDIER

Let me take your coat, m'sieur!

VALJEAN

Cosette shall live in my

protection.

THENARDIER

You are very welcome here!

VALJEAN

I will not forget my vow.

51.

THENARDIER

Take a glass!

MADAME THENARDIER

Take a chair!

VALJEAN

Cosette shall have a father now.

THENARDIER

What to do? What to say

Shall you carry our treasure

away?

What a gem! What a pearl!

Beyond rubies is our little girl!

How can we speak of debt?

Let's not haggle for darling

Colette!

MADAME THENARDIER

Cosette!

THENARDIER

Cosette -

Dear Fantine - gone to rest -

Have we done for her child what

is best?

Shared our bread - shared each

bone -

Treated her like she's one of our

own!

Like our own, m'sieur!

VALJEAN

Your feelings do you credit, sir.

And I will ease the parting blow.

Let us not talk of bargains and

bones and greed.

VALJEAN

Now may I say we are agreed?

MADAME THENARDIER

That would quite fit the bill

If she hadn't so often been ill.

Little dear, cost us dear!

Medicines are expensive, m'sieur.

Not that we begrudged a sou -

It's no more than we Christians

must do.

52.

THENARDIERS

One thing more! One small doubt!

There are treacherous people

about!

No offence! Please reflect!

Your intentions may not be

correct!

Valjean hands over more money.

VALJEAN

No more! Here's your price!

Fifteen hundred for your

sacrifice.

Come, Cosette, say goodbye.

Let's seek out some friendlier

sky.

Thank you both for Cosette -

It won't take you too long to

forget.

He leads Cosette to the door.

Valjean lifts Cosette into the waiting cab.

VALJEAN

Where I go, you will be.

COSETTE

Will you be like a Papa to me?

VALJEAN

Yes, Cosette!

This is true!

I'll be father and mother to you!

The cab sets off down the road.

Madame Thenardier takes the bunch of notes from her

husband's hand and inspects them.

THENARDIER

Not bad!

MADAME THENARDIER

Not enough!

Through the open door Thenardier sees a man on horseback

rattling up to the inn.

53.

MADAME THENARDIER

There's a copper at the door!

What the devil have you done?

Javert strides into the inn.

JAVERT

Where's the child Cosette?

MADAME THENARDIER

She's gone with a gent,

Didn't tell us where they went,

Didn't leave his home address.

JAVERT

Did you catch the fellow's name?

Both Thenardiers shake their heads.

Javert stares once, contemptuously, round the seedy inn,

and departs without a further word. Thenardier goes to the

doorway to watch him leave.

MADAME THENARDIER

You're a bloody fool

Look at what we got.

THENARDIER

Should have struck the iron,

Struck it while it's hot.

THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER

Next time round we'll be here

And we're gonna get the lot.

Valjean's cab, moving fast, passes down the road into the

city.

IN CAB - Valjean has one arm round Cosette to protect her

from the jolting of the cab. He gazes at her as she slips

into a fitful sleep.

VALJEAN

Suddenly I see

Suddenly it starts

When two anxious hearts

Beat as one.

Yesterday I was alone

Today you walk beside me

Something still unclear

Something not yet here

Has begun.

Suddenly the world

Seems a different place

Somehow full of grace

(more)

54.

VALJEAN (cont'd)

And delight.

How was I to know

That so much love

Was held inside me?

Something fresh and young

Something still unsung

Fills the night.

How was I to know at last

That happiness can come so fast?

Trusting me the way you do

I'm so afraid of failing you

Just a child who cannot know

That danger follows where I go

There are shadows everywhere

And memories I cannot share

Nevermore alone

Nevermore apart

You have warmed my heart

Like the sun.

You have brought the gift of life

And love so long denied me.

Suddenly I see

What I could not see

Something suddenly

Has begun.

He brushes the hair from her face, and satisfies himself

that she's comfortable. Then he puts his head out of the

window. At the gate into Paris, soldiers are checking

documents of occupants of carriages.

Valjean slips out of the carriage with Cosette and makes

his way along the wall, away from the gate.

Valjean finds a section of tumble down wall and climbs over.

Valjean and Cosette make their way down a darkened street.

Valjean and Cosette turn down a narrow street, no longer

hurrying.

The narrow street turns, and opens out onto the river.

Valjean stops. There, on the other side of the river, in the

light of a lamp, stands Javert.

55.

Now Valjean and Cosette are running - down narrow alleys,

into small dark courtyards, not knowing which way to turn.

Whenever Valjean thinks they've thrown their pursuer, there

he is, not far behind. And he's no longer alone. With him

are a detachment of soldiers.

Javert and his team never seem to run. But he's always

there.

Valjean and Cosette turn into a street that is walled in by

high windowless houses. They follow it round a corner to

find - a dead end. A high wall before them. They're

trapped.

Valjean looks round. No way out. Then he sees a nearby lamp

bracket. Hanging from it is the rope that is used to lower

the oil lamp for lighting. He tears off the rope and ties

one end round Cosette, beneath her armpits. Then holding

the other end, he scales the wall, using the corner to

brace himself as he rises. Once on the top, he hauls

Cosette up by the rope. Only then does he turn to look down

onto the other side.

A cloister. A building in the middle, windows glowing.

Grave stones black against the white snow. The sound of

women's voices, singing a psalm.

NUNS

Te lucis ante terminum

Rerum Creator poscimus

Ut pro tua clementia

Sis praesul et custodia...

Valjean lowers Cosette down into the garden, and drops down

after her.

Javert and his men enter the dead end to find them gone.

Valjean crouched low, with Cosette in his arms, holding her

still and quiet until Javert is gone.

Then he straightens up and looks round. He takes in the

sound of singing.

NUNS

Procul recedant somnia

Et noctium phantasmata

(more)

56.

NUNS (cont'd)

Hostemque nostrum comprime

Ne polluantur corpora...

FAUCHELEVENT

Who's that?

FAUCHELEVENT

Why, it's Monsieur Mayor!

VALJEAN

Who are you?

FAUCHELEVENT

Don't you remember? The cart fell

on me!

VALJEAN

Monsieur Fauchelevent!

FAUCHELEVENT

You saved my life! You got me

this job as a gardener!

VALJEAN

Now you can do the same for me.

We need a place of sanctuary.

This child and I, we need to

disappear.

FAUCHELEVENT

In this place of Holy Orders

You are brought to God's domain

May the sisters grant you shelter

May their prayers ease your pain.

VALJEAN

We'll give thanks for what is

granted

What the sisters may ordain

Here we pray for new beginnings -

Here our lives can start again.

57.

Valjean looks to the heavens. The camera soars into the air

and heads east as dawn breaks over Paris. We rush low over

Paris as the sun comes up, towards the Place de la Bastille.

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

Nine years later

The dawn light glows on a massive ELEPHANT. The monument,

made of wood and plaster, now ruined and crumbling, stands

on a plinth on one side of the wide open square. On the far

side, the remains of the great fortress that was the

Bastille. In the middle, scaffolding surrounds a half-built

triumphal column, which is being erected to celebrate the

new regime.

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

Paris, 1832.

The streets that run from the square lead in one direction

to the Paris of power and wealth; in the other direction

into the slums.

The camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant.

A head pops out of one of the elephant's many holes -

GAVROCHE, a street urchin. He gives a shrill whistle. At

once a dozen more street urchins show themselves, from

every crack in the monument's skin. Agile as a monkey,

Gavroche drops to the ground, followed by his band.

FOLLOW GAVROCHE in as he races down a grand boulevard,

dodging the crowds of strolling bourgeoisie and beggars,

weaving in and out of the lines of carriages attempting to

make their way in either direction. These are the

conveyances of the rich, fine gilded coaches with matched

horses and footmen on the back. Virtually at a standstill,

they lend Gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to

coach, a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite.

As he goes, the poor on the pavements sing to the stony-

faced rich in their golden high-sprung glory -

BEGGARS CHORUS

Look down and see the beggars at

your feet!

Look down and show some mercy if

you can!

Look down and see the sweepings

of the street!

(more)

58.

BEGGARS CHORUS (cont'd)

Look down, look down,

Upon your fellow man!

GAVROCHE

`Ow do you do? My name's

Gavroche!

These are my people, here's my

patch.

Not much to look at - nothing

posh!

Nothing that you'd call up to

scratch.

This is my school, my high

society!

Here in the slums of St Michel.

We live on crumbs of humble piety

Tough on the teeth - but what the

hell!

Think you're poor? Think you're

free?

Follow me! Follow me!

BEGGARS CHORUS

Look down and show some mercy if

you can!

Look down, look down, upon your

fellow man!

GAVROCHE

There was a time we killed the

King

We tried to change the world too

fast.

Now we have got another King,

He is no better than the last.

This is the land that fought for

liberty -

Now when we fight we fight for

bread!

Here is the thing about equality -

Everyone's equal when they're

dead.

Take your place!

(more)

59.

GAVROCHE (cont'd)

Take your chance!

Vive la France! Vive la France!

The carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a

crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of

sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch

what is going on. The street is padded with straw. Many eyes

gaze up at the draped windows. People cross themselves. A

priest is seen hurrying into the house, accompanied by two

altar boys.

Gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd.

The crowd is made up of citizens of Paris, student

revolutionaries, the poor and beggars. The students hand out

printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd.

STUDENTS/BEGGARS CHORUS

Look down and show some mercy if

you can!

Look down, look down, upon your

fellow man!

COURFEYRAC

When's it gonna end?

BEGGAR 1

When we gonna live?

JOLY

Something's gotta happen now!

BEGGAR 2

Something's gotta give!

STUDENTS AND BEGGARS

It'll come, it'll come, it'll

come...

It'll come, it'll come, it'll

come...

A student, ENJOLRAS, stands on a raised step, making an

impassioned speech with fellow student MARIUS. The occupant

of the stopped carriage is MONSIEUR GILLENORMAND, Marius'

Grandfather. He is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson

engaged in such an activity.

In the crowd a young street girl, EPONINE, has her eyes fixed

longingly on the handsome Marius.

ENJOLRAS

Where are the leaders of the

land?

Where are the swells who run this

show?

60.

MARIUS

Only one man, General Lamarque

Speaks for the people here below!

ENJOLRAS

Lamarque is ill and fading fast -

Won't last a week out, so they

say.

MARIUS

With all the anger in the land,

How long before the Judgement

Day?

ENJOLRAS

Before we cut the fat ones down

to size?

STUDENTS

Before the barricades arise?

POLICE

Look down, look down, don't look us

in the eye!

Look down, look down, stay here and

you die!

ENJOLRAS

Tomorrow we will return!

MARIUS

Tell everyone you know

COURFEYRAC

We will show them!

COMBEFERRE

Lamarque is the only leader on our

side!

COURFEYRAC

We have a right to pray for

Lamarque!

JOLY

We need more people, then the

police will not dare ride against

us!

MARIUS

Vive le General Lamarque!

61.

Marius turns to see his Grandfather staring him down,

furious.

GILLENORMAND

Do you have any idea of the shame

you bring on your family! You're

behaving like a child.

Gillenormand spies a gun poking out of his jacket.

Gillenormand turns to get back in his carriage.

Through a crack in a door, we see Marius sitting on a tatty

mattress in a tiny hovel of a room. He is taking out a

hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. His

eye is caught by the ring on his finger.

CLOSE ON a signet ring, a family crest.

Marius stares at the ring then takes it off his finger.

We reveal EPONINE staring at him through the door.

EPONINE

Hey there Monsieur what's new

with you?

Haven't seen much of you of late.

Planning no doubt to change the

world?

Plotting to overthrow the state?

Still living here in this old sewer

Might as well doss down in a ditch

You still pretending to be poor

Everyone knows your Grandpa's rich

Marius rushes down the stairs of the slum, Eponine following.

We see glimpses of misery off the stairwell.

MARIUS

How did you...?

EPONINE

There's lots of things I know

MARIUS

Won't take a franc that I've not

earned

All of those bridges have been

burned.

EPONINE

I like the way you talk Monsieur!

MARIUS

I like the way you always tease.

62.

Eponine comes to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius.

EPONINE

Little he knows -

Little he sees.

Marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau

Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes Marius sees

two people in the street outside. One is an old gentleman,

Valjean. The other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The

two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from

evening church service.

Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. He's never seen

anyone so lovely in his life. We hear the instrumental

foreshadowing of `A Heart Full of Love'.

As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets

his eyes. She too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he

already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held

gaze.

Marius continues on down the street and when he looks back,

at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again.

Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding her

jealously from this distant boy's gaze.

We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the

Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's

approach with their gang of crooks, Babet, Brujon,

Clacquesous, Montparnasse.

THENARDIER

Everyone here, you know your

place -

Brujon, Babet, Clacquesous -

You, Montparnasse, watch for the

law -

With Eponine - take care.

(Montparnasse hurries over

to the doorway where

Eponine was watching

Marius)

You turn on the tears!

(to Madame Thenardier who

is holding a baby)

No mistakes, my dears!

Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth

of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sat on the

ground holding the crying infant. Cosette is a few steps

behind, still entranced by the sight of Marius.

63.

THENARDIER

Please, M'sieur, come this way.

Here's a child that ain't eaten

today.

Save a life, spare a sou!

God rewards all the good that you

do.

MADAME THENARDIER

Wait a bit! Know that face!

(to Monsieur Thenardier)

Ain't the world a remarkable

place!

THENARDIER

Men like me don't forget -

You're the bastard who borrowed

Cosette!

VALJEAN

What is this? Are you mad?

No, Monsieur, you don't know what

you say!

THENARDIER

You know me! I know you!

And you'll pay what I'm due.

EPONINE

(shouts from up the

street)

It's the police! Disappear!

Run for it! It's Javert!

JAVERT

Another brawl in the square!

Another stink in the air!

Was there a witness to this?

Well, let him speak to Javert!

64.

JAVERT

Monsieur, these streets are not

safe.

But let these vermin beware,

We'll see that justice is done!

JAVERT

Look upon this fine collection

Crawled from underneath a stone.

This swarm of worms and maggots

Could have picked you to the

bone!

I know this man over here,

I know his name and his trade.

And on your witness, m'sieur,

I'll see him suitably paid.

JAVERT

But where's the gentlemen gone?

And why on earth did he run?

THENARDIER

You will have a job to find him!

He's not all he seems to be -

And that girl he trails behind

him

She's the child he stole from me!

JAVERT

Could it be he's that old

jailbird

That the tide now washes in?

Heard my name and started

running...

All the omens point to him.

JAVERT

And the girl who stood beside

him,

When I turned they both had gone.

Could he be the man I've hunted?

Could it be he's Jean Valjean?

THENARDIER

In the absence of a victim,

Dear Inspector, may I go?

And remember when you've nicked

him

It was me what told you so.

65.

JAVERT

(to himself)

Let the old man keep on running

I will run him off his feet!

(to the crowd)

Everyone about your business!

(to Gavroche)

Clear this garbage off the

street!

GAVROCHE

That inspector thinks he's

something

But it's me who runs this town!

And my theatre never closes

And the curtain's never down!

Trust Gavroche! Have no fear!

You can always find me here!

EPONINE

Cosette! Now I remember...

Cosette! How can it be?

We were children together.

Look what's become of me.

MARIUS

Eponine! Who was that girl?

EPONINE

That bourgeois two-a-penny thing!

MARIUS

Eponine, find her for me!

EPONINE

What will you give me?

MARIUS

Anything!

EPONINE

Got you all excited now,

But God knows what you see in

her.

Aren't you all delighted now?

No, I don't want your money, sir.

66.

MARIUS

Eponine, do this for me,

Discover where she lives.

But careful how you go -

Don't let your father know.

Eponine! I'm lost until she's

found.

EPONINE

You see? I told you so!

There's lots of things I know!

Eponine, she knows her way

around.

WIDE of the Police Headquarters on the Isle de la Cite: a

huge bureaucracy. The camera finds Javert standing inside

looking out of a door leading onto the roof. As he sings

he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the

HQ, a monumental stone eagle. He looks down at the lights

reflected in the river below. Then up at the great city.

Javert too has a God, and this is his prayer.

JAVERT

There, out in the darkness

A fugitive running

Running from God

Fallen from grace -

God be my witness

I never shall yield

Till we come face to face -

Till we come face to face...

He knows his way in the dark

Mine is the way of the Lord

Those who follow the path of the

righteous

Shall have their reward

And if they fall

As Lucifer fell -

The flame!

The sword!

Stars in your multitudes!

Scarce to be counted

Filling the darkness

With order and light -

You are the sentinels

Silent and sure

Keeping watch in the night -

Keeping watch in the night...

You know your place in the sky

You hold your course

(more)

67.

JAVERT (cont'd)

And your aim

And each in your season

Returns and returns

And is always the same

And if you fall

As Lucifer fell

You fall

In flame!

And so it must be, and so it is

written

On the doorway to paradise

That those who falter

And those who fall

Must pay the price!

Lord, let me find him

That I may see him

Safe behind bars!

I will never rest till then!

This I swear

This I swear by the stars!

Javert stands silhouetted against the stars, his arms

raised up to the night sky.

Marius comes down the street, his mind full of thoughts of

Cosette.

Marius arrives at the first floor front room. Here a group

of students are cleaning rifles and sharing their

excitement at the coming revolution: ENJOLRAS, COMBEFERRE,

COURFEYRAC, JOLY, GRANTAIRE, FEUILLY, PROUVAIRE and others.

ENJOLRAS

Well, Courfeyrac! Do we have all

the guns?

Joly, Prouvaire! Our time is

running short!

COURFEYRAC

Students, workers, everyone!

There's a river on the run!

Like the flowing of the tide,

Paris is coming to our side!

COMBEFERRE

Enjolras! At Notre Dame

The sections are prepared!

68.

FEUILLY

At Rue du Bac

They're straining at the leash!

ENJOLRAS

Grantaire, put the bottle down!

Did we get the guns we need?

GRANTAIRE

Give me brandy on my breath

And I'll breathe them all to death!

ENJOLRAS

The time is near...

So near it's stirring the blood

in their veins.

And yet beware!

Don't let the wine go to your

brains.

For the army we fight is a

dangerous foe

With the men and the arms that we

never can match.

It is easy to sit here and swat

them like flies

But the National Guard will be

harder to catch.

We need a sign

To rally the people

To call them to arms

To bring them in line!

JOLY

Marius, wake up!

What's wrong today?

You look as if you've seen a

ghost.

GRANTAIRE

Some wine, and say what's going

on!

MARIUS

A ghost, you say? A ghost maybe!

She was like a ghost to me -

One minute there - then she was

gone!

GRANTAIRE

I am agog! I am aghast!

Is Marius in love at last?

I've never heard him Ooh and Aah.

You talk of battles to be won

(more)

69.

GRANTAIRE (cont'd)

And here he comes like Don Juan!

It is better than an opera!

ENJOLRAS

It is time for us all

To decide who we are.

Do we fight for the right

To a night at the opera now?

Have you asked yourselves

What's the price you might pay?

Is this simply a game

For rich young boys to play?

The colours of the world

Are changing day by day -

Red -    the blood of angry men!

Black    - the dark of ages past!

Red -    a world about to dawn!

Black    - the night that ends at

last!

MARIUS

Had you seen her today

You might know how it feels

To be struck to the bone

By a moment of breathless delight!

Had you been there today

You might also have known

How the world may be changed

In just one burst of light

And what was right seems wrong

And what was wrong seems right!

GRANTAIRE

Red!

MARIUS

I feel my soul on fire!

GRANTAIRE

Black!

MARIUS

My world if she's not there!

STUDENTS

Red!

MARIUS

The colour of desire!

STUDENTS

Black!

70.

MARIUS

The colour of despair!

ENJOLRAS

Marius, you're no longer a child -

I do not doubt you mean it well

But now there is a higher call!

Who cares about your lonely soul?

We strive towards a larger goal -

Our little lives don't count at

all!

ENJOLRAS

Red!

STUDENTS

The blood of angry men!

ENJOLRAS

Black!

STUDENTS

The dark of ages past!

Red - a world about to dawn!

Black - the night that ends at

last!

GAVROCHE

Listen! Listen to me!

COURFEYRAC

Listen, everybody!

GAVROCHE

General Lamarque is dead!

ENJOLRAS

Lamarque is dead...

Lamarque... His death is the hour

of fate.

The people's man...

His death is the sign we await!

On his funeral day they will

honour his name

With the light of rebellion

ablaze in their eyes.

From their candles of grief we

will kindle our flame.

On the tomb of Lamarque shall our

barricades rise!

The time is here!

(more)

71.

ENJOLRAS (cont'd)

Let us welcome it gladly with

courage and cheer!

STUDENT

Let us take to the street with no

doubt in our hearts

COURFEYRAC

But a jubilant shout!

LESGLES

They will come one and all!

STUDENTS

They will come when we call!

As the students sing, Eponine enters wanting to talk to

Marius. Marius sees her.

Cosette is pacing in her bedroom. It's a pretty room, the

best room in this small summer house. Her shutters are

open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. She looks at

herself in a mirror, aware of her looks perhaps for the

first time.

COSETTE

How strange -

This feeling that my life's begun

at last!

This change -

Can people really fall in love so

fast?

What's the matter with you,

Cosette?

Have you been too much on your

own?

So many things unclear -

So many things unknown...

In my life

There are so many questions and

answers

That somehow seem wrong.

In my life

There are times when I catch in

the silence

The sigh of a faraway song

And it sings

Of a world that I long to see -

Out of reach

Just a whisper away

Waiting for me!

Does he know I'm alive?

Do I know if he's real?

(more)

72.

COSETTE (cont'd)

Does he see what I see?

Does he feel what I feel?

In my life

I'm no longer alone -

Now the love in my life

Is so near...

Find me now! Find me here!

VALJEAN

Dear Cosette,

You're such a lonely child.

How pensive, how sad you seem to

me.

Believe me, were it within my

power

I'd fill each passing hour.

How quiet it must be, I can see,

With only me for company.

COSETTE

There's so little I know

That I'm longing to know

Of the man that you were

In a time long ago...

There's so little you say

Of the life you have known,

Why you keep to yourself,

Why we're always alone.

So dark! So dark and deep,

The secrets that you keep!

In my life

Please forgive what I say

You are loving and gentle and

good.

But papa, dear papa,

In your eyes I am still like that

child

Who was lost in a wood.

VALJEAN

No more words -

No more words.

It's a time that is dead.

There are words

That are better unheard,

Better unsaid.

COSETTE

In my life

I'm no longer a child and I yearn

For the truth that you know

Of the years... Years ago!

73.

Valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom. A simple wooden

shack at the back of the summerhouse, Valjean himself lives

with spartan simplicity - he has given the best room to

Cosette.

Cosette follows. Valjean sits on his bed, his back to

Cosette.

VALJEAN

You will learn.

Truth is given by God

To us all in our time,

In our turn.

Marius rushes down the street, Eponine following. At the

far end is the walled garden behind which lies Valjean's

house.

MARIUS

In my life

She has burst like the music of

angels

The light of the sun!

And my life seems to stop

As if something is over

And something has scarcely begun!

Eponine, you're the friend

Who has brought me here.

Thanks to you I am one with the

Gods

And heaven is near!

And I soar through a world that

is new,

That is free!

EPONINE

Every word that he says

Is a dagger in me!

In my life

There's been no one like him

anywhere,

Anywhere, where he is

If he asked... I'd be his!

MARIUS/EPONINE

In my life

There is someone who touches my

life -

MARIUS

(sees Cosette in the

garden)

Waiting near!

74.

EPONINE

Waiting here!

MARIUS

A heart full of love!

MARIUS

A heart full of song!

I'm doing everything all wrong -

Oh God, for shame -

I do not even know your name.

Dear Mad'moiselle,

Won't you say?

Will you tell?

COSETTE

A heart full of love!

No fear, no regret!

MARIUS

My name is Marius Pontmercy.

COSETTE

And mine's Cosette.

MARIUS

Cosette... I don't know what to

say -

COSETTE

Then make no sound.

MARIUS

I am lost -

COSETTE

I am found!

MARIUS

A heart full of light -

COSETTE/MARIUS

A night bright as day -

MARIUS

And you must never go away,

Cosette - Cosette!

COSETTE

This is a chain we'll never

break.

75.

MARIUS

Do I dream?

COSETTE

I'm awake.

MARIUS

A heart full of love -

EPONINE

He was never mine to lose

Why regret

What could not be?

COSETTE

A heart full of you -

EPONINE

These are words he'll never say

Not to me, not to me

Not for me!

MARIUS

A single look and then I knew!

COSETTE

I knew it too!

EPONINE

His heart full of love...

MARIUS

From today -

EPONINE

He will never feel this way.

COSETTE

Every day...

MARIUS/COSETTE

For it isn't a dream -

Not a dream

After all!

VALJEAN

Cosette! Cosette!

76.

MONTPARNASSE

This is his lair!

I've seen the old fox around.

BABET

He keeps himself to himself

He's staying close to the ground.

THENARDIER

I smell profit here!

Ten years ago

He came and paid for Cosette.

I let her go for a song.

It's time we settled the debt.

This'll cost him dear.

BRUJON

What do I care

Who you should rob?

Gimme my share!

Finish the job!

THENARDIER

You shut your mouth!

You'll get what's yours!

BRUJON

What have we here?

THENARDIER

Who is this hussy?

BABET

It's your brat Eponine!

Don't you know your own kid?

Why's she hanging about here?

77.

THENARDIER

Eponine, get on home!

You're not needed in this.

We're enough here without you.

EPONINE

I know this house, I tell you!

There's nothing here for you!

Just the old man and the girl.

They live ordinary lives.

THENARDIER

Don't interfere!

You've got some gall!

Take care, young miss,

You've got a lot to say!

BRUJON

She's going soft!

CLACQUESOUS

Happens to all!

MONTPARNASSE

Go home, Eponine!

Go home, you're in the way!

They huddle round the garden gate, which is now broken

open.

EPONINE

I'm gonna scream! I'm gonna warn

them here!

THENARDIER

One little scream and you'll

regret it for a year!

He goes to the gate and opens it.

Eponine screams.

Valjean, now in his own bedroom, hears the scream and turns

to the window.

Thenardier and his gang shrink into the shadows, as

Eponine's scream ends at last.

78.

THENARDIER

Make for the sewers!

Get underground!

Leave her to me,

Don't wait around!

He turns on Eponine and slaps her hard across the face.

THENARDIER

You wait, my girl!

You'll rue this night!

I'll make you scream!

You'll scream all right!

His men have levered up a grating, and now Thenardier and

the gang disappear down into the sewers.

Valjean comes running into Cosette's room. Valjean takes

her in his arms.

VALJEAN

My God, Cosette!

I heard a cry in the dark.

I heard the shout of angry voices

in the street.

COSETTE

Three men I saw beyond the

wall...

Three men in shadow moving fast!

VALJEAN

This is a warning to us all!

These are the shadows of the

past!

He moves away to his own bedroom.

VALJEAN

Must be Javert.

He's found my cover at last.

I've got to get Cosette away

Before he returns.

He comes back to Cosette.

VALJEAN

We must get away from shadows

That will never let us be.

Tonight we leave Cosette!

COSETTE

To where?

79.

VALJEAN

Rue de L'Homme Armee.

COSETTE

No! No!

VALJEAN

And then a ship across the sea.

VALJEAN

Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave,

And say no more.

Tonight we'll away!

COSETTE

(overlapping)

No! Please no! We can't go!

VALJEAN

Hurry, Cosette!

It's time to close another door

And live another day!

Valjean leaves to start packing.

Feverishly, Cosette scribbles a letter.

Cosette hurries down the   garden to the gate, and goes to

put the folded letter in   the grill where her and Marius'

hands entwined. Then she   sees Eponine. Eponine steps

forward. She thrusts her   letter into her hand.

COSETTE

Please give this to Marius! He

must know where to find me.

She runs back inside.

Eponine crumples up the letter.

She walks sadly away down the street.

Rain is just starting to fall.

EPONINE

And now I'm all alone again -

Nowhere to turn, no one to go to.

Without a home, without a friend,

(more)

80.

EPONINE (cont'd)

Without a face to say hello to.

The city goes to bed

And I can live inside my head.

On my own

Pretending he's beside me

All alone

I walk with him till morning

Without him

I feel his arms around me

And when I lose my way I close my

eyes

And he has found me.

EPONINE

In the rain

The pavement shines like silver

All the lights

Are misty in the river

In the darkness the trees are

full of starlight

And all I see is him and me

forever and forever!

And I know it's only in my mind -

That I'm talking to myself and

not to him.

And although I know that he is

blind,

Still I say there's a way for us.

I love him

But when the night is over

He is gone - the river's just a

river.

Without him the world around me

changes -

The trees are bare and everywhere

The streets are full of

strangers.

I love him

But every day I'm learning

All my life I've only been

pretending.

Without me, his world will go on

turning

A world that's full of happiness

That I have never know.

I love him

I love him

I love him

But only on my own.

81.

Her solitary journey has brought her to the Gorbeau slum.

She goes inside.

Eponine stands outside Marius' door. She opens the letter,

reads it, then hides it in her pocket. She pushes open

Marius' door. Marius looks up.

EPONINE

I came to tell you she's gone.

MARIUS

Gone? What do you mean?

EPONINE

She's gone to England.

Marius sets off at a run towards the Rue Plumet.

Marius finds the gate broken open, sees the house beyond

dark and deserted. He pushes in to the garden, up to the

house windows, sees the rooms empty within. He stands

staring, in shock.

Eponine has followed him, and watches him in silence.

Valjean and Cosette sit on either side of the carriage,

apart, staring out of their respective windows. A stark

contrast to the carriage scene when Valjean sang to Cosette

as a little girl.

VALJEAN

One day more!

Another day, another destiny.

This never-ending road to

Calvary.

These men who seem to know my

crime

Will surely come a second time -

One day more!

Marius by the empty house.

82.

MARIUS

I did not live until today -

How can I live when we are parted?

VALJEAN

One day more!

COSETTE

Tomorrow you'll be worlds away

And yet with you my world has

started!

INTERCUT between Eponine at the gate, Cosette and Valjean

in the carriage, and Marius in the dark garden.

EPONINE

One more day all on my own...

MARIUS/COSETTE

Will we ever meet again?

EPONINE

One more day with him not

caring...

MARIUS/COSETTE

I was born to be with you!

EPONINE

What a life I might have known...

MARIUS/COSETTE

And I swear I will be true!

EPONINE

But he never saw me there.

CHANVRERIE - NIGHT

Enjolras and the students have a production line under way

for making bullets. The rifles are now stacked and ready

for the uprising. Grantaire is downstairs flirting with a

BARMAID. MADAME HUCHELOUP the proprietress of the Cafe

Musain is sewing a red revolutionary flag to help the

students.

ENJOLRAS

One more day before the storm!

83.

INTERCUT WITH Marius walking back sadly through the Rue de

la Chanvrerie. Eponine follows him at a distance.

MARIUS

Do I follow where she goes?

ENJOLRAS

At the barricades of freedom!

MARIUS

Shall I join my brothers there?

ENJOLRAS

When our ranks begin to form -

MARIUS

Do I stay and do I dare?

ENJOLRAS

(from top of stairs, for

Grantaire's benefit)

Will you take your place with me?

Grantaire rather reluctantly goes upstairs.

ALL

The time is now!

The day is here!

One day more!

Javert is briefing a hundred uniformed police about the

coming day in a grand ornate old room at Police

Headquarters.

JAVERT

One day more to revolution.

We will nip it in the bud.

We'll be ready for these

schoolboys.

They will wet themselves with

blood!

VALJEAN

One day more!

Monsieur and Madame Thenardier are in the ground-floor bar,

slyly watching a student smuggling some rifles up the

stairs disguised in a piece of cloth.

84.

Joly takes a tray and collects empty tankards. As he

ascends the stairs, Madame Hucheloup tries to get him to

give the tankards back.

THENARDIERS

Watch'em run amuck!

Catch'em as they fall!

Never know your luck

When there's a free-for-all.

Here a little dip,

There a little touch -

Most of them are goners

So they won't miss much!

The drinkers in the bar raise their glasses to the students

with their rifles. The students appeal to them. Grantaire

is drunk already. Joly starts to melt the tankards in a pot

to make more bullets. Marius enters the ground floor and

takes the red flag from Madame Hucheloup that she has just

finished. The citizens on the ground floor join the

students.

STUDENTS/CROWD

One day to a new beginning!

Raise the flag of freedom high!

Every man will be a king!

Every man will be a king!

There's a new world for the

winning!

There's a new world to be won!

Do you hear the people sing?

Marius enters the first floor to join them at last.

MARIUS

My place is here!

I fight with you!

MUSAIN GROUND & 1ST FLOOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Valjean and Cosette arrive at their new hideout -

Marius ties the red flag onto a flagpole -

VALJEAN

One day more!

COSETTE/MARIUS

I did not live until today

How can I live when we are

parted?

Eponine outside the cafe, gazing longingly towards Marius -

EPONINE

One more day on my own...

85.

Javert in the police station to his men -

JAVERT

I will join these people's heroes

I will follow where they go.

I will learn their little

secrets,

I will know the things they know.

VALJEAN/JAVERT

One day more!

MARIUS/COSETTE

Tomorrow you'll be worlds away

And yet with you my world has

started.

JAVERT

One more day to revolution

We will nip it in the bud

We'll be ready for these

schoolboys -

THENARDIERS

Watch'em run amuck

Catch'em as they fall

Never know your luck

When there's a free-for-all!

VALJEAN

Tomorrow we'll be far away.

VALJEAN/JAVERT

Tomorrow is the judgement day.

ALL

Tomorrow we'll discover

What our God in heaven has in

store -

One more dawn!

One more day!

One day more!

We pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at

the first floor window with the students beyond them to see

that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the

street and have all joined in the final chorus.

All is still. Then comes the soft beating of draped drums.

The tramp of feet.

All down the streets, waiting, the silent faces of the

poor. Among them we see Enjolras, Marius, and the radical

students.

86.

CROWD

Do you hear the people sing

Singing the song of angry men?

It is the music of a people

Who will not be slaves again!

CROWD

When the beating of your heart

Echoes the beating of the drums

There is a life about to start

When tomorrow comes!

CROWD

Will you join in our crusade?

Who will be strong and stand with

me?

Beyond the barricade

Is there a world you long to see?

ENJOLRAS

Then join in the fight

That will give you the right

To be free!

87.

STUDENTS/CROWD

Do you hear the people sing

Singing the song of angry men?

It is the music of a people

Who will not be slaves again!

When the beating of your heart

Echoes the beating of the drums

There is a life about to start

When tomorrow comes!

ENJOLRAS

Will you give all you can give

So that our banner may advance?

COURFEYRAC

Some will fall and some will live

Will you stand up and take your

chance?

ENJOLRAS/MARIUS/COURFEYRAC

The blood of the martyrs

Will water the meadows of France!

STUDENTS/CROWD

Do you hear the people sing

Singing the song of angry men?

It is the music of a people

Who will not be slaves again!

When the beating of your heart

Echoes the beating of the drums

There is a life about to start

When tomorrow comes!

STUDENTS/CROWD

Will you join in our crusade?

Who will be strong and stand with

me?

Somewhere beyond the barricade

Is there a world you long to see?

Do you hear the people sing?

(more)

88.

STUDENTS/CROWD (cont'd)

Say, do you hear the distant

drums?

It is the future that we bring

When tomorrow comes!

The students and crowd come face to face with the calvary. On

one side, muskets of the infantry poke through the broken

down fence surrounding the elephant. Other infantry have

taken up position in a cafe opposite, upending tables to

provide cover.

There is a tense, prolonged silence. Then suddenly one

nervous SOLDIER lets off a round. It hits a middle aged

kindly looking WOMAN CITIZEN in the crowd around the coffin

carriage. The crowd is furious. Students charge the soldier,

grab his musket and knock him down with the hilt of the gun.

More shots ring out. The cavalry charges. The funeral

explodes into a riot. The people of Paris turn on the

dragoons, the National Guards, the police. More squadrons

of dragoons charge into the crowd, sabres unsheathed. Women

run screaming in terror.

ENJOLRAS

To the barricades!

STUDENTS/CROWD

To the barricades! To arms! To

arms!

Some students fire weapons into the air, some into the

cavalry and at the infantry. Enjolras knocks a calvary

officer off his horse and Marius jumps on the horse.

The students break away and race off through the cafe into

a side street where citizens begin to erect a barricade. A

cavalry rider gives chase and is shot by one of the

students and falls through the window of an upended

carriage. The students, with Marius on horseback, race to

the slums.

FOLLOW the students as they burst into their home street.

They have been joined by a motley collection of citizens

including burghers and an old eccentric man FATHER MABEUF

who works as hard as anyone. They raid a fencing shop and a

gun shop for weapons, they force wives to give up their

husbands' muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution

on their front doors, they encourage homeowners to

contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to

help overcome any reluctance. Soon the street is raining

tables, chairs, mattresses, sofas. They smash streetlamps.

They set to work to build their barricade. Students

commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the

barricade's heart. Three students arrive in the street

hauling an uprooted tree.

89.

ENJOLRAS

Here upon these stones

We will build our barricade.

In the heart of the city

We claim as our own

Each man to his duty

And don't be afraid.

ENJOLRAS

Wait!

I will need a report

On the strength of the foe.

JAVERT

I can find out the truth!

I know their ways,

Fought their wars,

Served my time

In the days

Of my youth.

PROUVAIRE

See! The people unite!

GRANTAIRE

Pray your right

COMBEFERRE

Dogs will bark!

GAVROCHE

Fleas will bite!

LESGLES

They will do what is right.

90.

The barricade is now complete: an impressive wall up to

twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can

be wheeled open to allow access. Two smaller barricades

protect the left and right side of the cafe. Enjolras

climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his

little army. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame

Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing

armchair - and adds it to the barricade. As the men sing

she steals it back defiantly.

ENJOLRAS

Red, the blood of angry men!

ALL

Black, the dark of ages past!

Red, a world about to dawn!

Black, the night that ends at

last!

It is night. The students have been waiting for hours.

A single flaming torch atop the barricade caged in by cobbles

underlights a fluttering red flag.

There is no sign yet of any opposition.

A boy climbs down from sentry duty on the barricade. Marius

realizes its Eponine. She sits down with her back to him.

MARIUS

Hey, little boy, what's this I see?

God Eponine the things you do!

EPONINE

I know this is no place for me,

Still I would rather be with you!

MARIUS

Get out before the trouble

starts!

Get out, `Ponine, you might get

shot!

EPONINE

I've got you worried now, I have!

That shows you like me quite a

lot...

MARIUS

Get Out!

Joly, sentry on the main barricade, sees a figure approach.

91.

JOLY

He's back!

JAVERT

Listen, my friends,

I have done as I said.

I have been to their lines,

I have counted each man.

I will tell what I can.

Better be warned

They have armies to spare

And our danger is real -

We will need all our cunning

To bring them to heel.

ENJOLRAS

Have faith!

If you know what their movements

are

We'll spoil their game.

There are ways that a people can

fight -

We shall overcome their power!

JAVERT

I have overheard their plans.

There will be no attack tonight.

They intend to starve you out

Before they start a proper fight -

Concentrate their force,

Hit us when it's light -

GAVROCHE

Liar!

GAVROCHE

Good evening, dear Inspector.

Lovely evening, my dear!

I know this man, my friends.

His name's Inspector Javert!

So don't believe a word he says

Cause none of it's true.

This only goes to show

What little people can do.

92.

COURFEYRAC

Bravo, little Gavroche!

You're the top of the class!

PROUVAIRE

So what are we going to do

With this snake in the grass?

ENJOLRAS

Tie this man and take him

To the tavern in there!

The people will decide your fate,

Inspector Javert!

JAVERT

Shoot me now or shoot me later -

Every schoolboy to his sport!

Death to each and every traitor!

I renounce your people's court!

ENJOLRAS

Take this man. Bring him through.

There is work we have to do.

ENJOLRAS

When are they coming!?

93.

ARMY OFFICER

Who's there?

ENJOLRAS

French Revolution.

ARMY OFFICER

Fire!

ENJOLRAS

(as students return fire)

Comrades, do not fire back! Do not

waste powder!

ARMY OFFICER

Who's there? Get down!

MABEUF

Vive la France!

ARMY OFFICER

Fire!

94.

MARIUS

Clear out or I'll blow up the

barricade!

ARMY OFFICER

Blow it up then and take yourself

with it!

MARIUS

And myself with it!

FEUILLY

(to Marius)

Thank you!

LESGLES

What were you thinking!

MARIUS

Eponine! What have you done?

EPONINE

Here... It's from Cosette...

I kept it from you...

EPONINE

Don't be too hard on me...

MARIUS

Eponine, you're hurt!

You need some help!

95.

EPONINE

Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius -

I don't feel any pain.

A little fall of rain

Can hardly hurt me now.

You're here - that's all I need

to know

And you will keep me safe

And you will keep me close

And rain will make the flowers

grow...

MARIUS

But you will live, Eponine - Dear

God above!

If I could close your wounds with

words of love -

EPONINE

Just hold me now, and let it be.

Shelter me... Comfort me...

MARIUS

You will live a hundred years

If I could show you how...

I won't desert you now...

EPONINE

The rain can't hurt me now...

This rain will wash away what's

past

And you will keep me safe

And you will keep me close

I'll sleep in your embrace at

last.

MARIUS

Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine

You won't feel any pain

A little fall of rain

Can hardly hurt you now

I'm here.

EPONINE

So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius

I don't feel any pain

A little fall of rain

Can hardly hurt me now...

MARIUS

I will stay with you

Till you are sleeping.

EPONINE

That's all I need to know

And you will keep me safe

(more)

96.

EPONINE (cont'd)

And you will keep me close

And rain..

Will make the flowers...

Grow...

Eponine dies in Marius's arms.

Marius looks up at the others, his eyes full of tears.

ENJOLRAS

They were the first to fall.

The first to fall upon this

barricade.

MARIUS

Her name was Eponine!

Her life was cold and dark, yet

she was unafraid!

COMBEFERRE

We fight here in her name...

PROUVAIRE

She will not die in vain...

LESGLES

She will not be betrayed...

They pick up Eponine's body and carry her into the tavern.

COURFEYRAC

(to Gavroche)

Are you alright?

GAVROCHE

That was my sister.

Marius reads the letter Eponine has given him. He takes out

pencil and paper and writes a note. Looking round, he sees

Gavroche.

MARIUS

Gavroche! Do you know the Rue de

l'Homme Arme?

GAVROCHE

Course I do!

MARIUS

Will you take this for me?

He holds out his note.

97.

The LANDLADY climbs the stairs, followed by Gavroche. The

landlady indicates the door, and Gavroche knocks boldly.

The door opens a crack to reveal a cautious Valjean.

GAVROCHE

Letter for Cosette.

VALJEAN

I'll take it.

Gavroche holds out the letter with one hand, not quite

giving it, the other hand open for a tip.

Valjean gives him a coin, which he pockets as he hands over

the letter.

GAVROCHE

Something for you, something for

me. Who needs charity?

ON VALJEAN - As he reads the note.

VALJEAN

`Dearest Cosette, you have

entered my soul

And soon you will be gone.

Can it be only a day since we met

And the world was reborn?

If I should fall in the battle to

come

Let this be my goodbye.

Now that I know you love me as

well

It is harder to die.

I pray that God will bring me

home

To be with you.

Pray for your Marius.

He prays for you.'

He looks up, deeply distressed. He can't bear the thought

of losing Cosette.

VALJEAN

They haven't got a chance, these

boys

They almost certainly will die

She'll be alone

And she will need me all the more

And we will go on as before

When he is gone

I dare not think like this

I must find this boy

98.

Valjean walks the streets, not caring where he goes,

struggling with his tormented thoughts. He sees a barricade

being dismantled. And bodies.

Suddenly he knows what he's going to do. He sees a dead

soldier. He takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on.

He continues on his way in the dark.

Looking up he sees that he's been walking all the time

towards the very barricade where Marius waits.

Now looking like a soldier, he passes unchallenged through

their lines, and into the shadows.

As he passes, he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the

rooftops.

Glimpses through the barricade of a lone figure approaching

from the far end of the narrow street.

The figure comes into lamp light. It's Valjean, in the

soldier's jacket. The student sentries level their guns.

Gavroche jumps up.

VALJEAN

Don't shoot!

JOLY

Here comes a man in uniform!

What brings you to this place?

VALJEAN

I come here as a volunteer.

JOLY

Approach and show your face!

PROUVAIRE

You wear an army uniform.

VALJEAN

That's why they let me through.

The student sentries open the slot in the barricade to let

Valjean enter.

JOLY

You've got some years behind you,

sir.

VALJEAN

There's much that I can do.

99.

JOLY

You see that prisoner over there?

GRANTAIRE

A volunteer like you!

COMBEFERRE

A spy who calls himself Javert!

GRANTAIRE

He's going to get it too!

GAVROCHE

Don't shoot! I know him! He's no

soldier!

ENJOLRAS

For your presence of mind,

For the deed you have done,

I will thank you, M'sieur,

When our battle is won.

MARIUS

Thank you, M'sieur.

VALJEAN

Give me no thanks, M'sieur.

There's something you can do.

ENJOLRAS

If it is in my power.

VALJEAN

Give me the spy Javert!

Let me take care of him.

100.

JAVERT

The law is inside out.

The world is upside down.

ENJOLRAS

Do what you have to do -

The man belongs to you.

ENJOLRAS

The enemy may be regrouping!

Hold yourselves in readiness!

Come, my friends, back to your

positions!

The dawn is breaking fast.

VALJEAN

We meet again...

JAVERT

You've hungered for this all your

life.

Take your revenge.

How right you should kill with a

knife.

VALJEAN

You talk too much.

Your life is safe in my hands.

JAVERT

Don't understand...

VALJEAN

Get out of here.

JAVERT

Valjean, take care!

I'm warning you.

VALJEAN

Clear out of here!

JAVERT

Once a thief, forever a thief.

What you want, you always steal.

You would trade your life for

mine.

Yes, Valjean, you want a deal!

Shoot me now for all I care -

If you let me go, beware!

You'll still answer to Javert!

101.

VALJEAN

You are wrong, and always have

been wrong.

I'm a man no worse than any man.

You are free, and there are no

conditions -

No bargains or petitions.

There's nothing that I blame you

for.

You've done your duty, nothing

more.

No doubt our paths will cross

again.

VALJEAN

Go!

ENJOLRAS

Courfeyrac, you take the watch -

They may attack before it's

light.

Everybody keep the faith,

For certain as our banner flies,

We are not alone -

The people too must rise!

ENJOLRAS

Marius, rest.

GRANTAIRE

Drink with me to days gone by!

FEUILLY

Sing with me the songs we knew!

PROUVAIRE

Here's to pretty girls

Who went to our heads!

JOLY

Here's to witty girls

Who went to our beds!

102.

STUDENTS

Here's to them -

(Marius sings to

Valjean)

And here's to you!

GRANTAIRE

Drink with me to days gone by!

Can it be you fear to die?

Will the world remember you when

you fall?

Can it be your death

Means nothing at all?

Is your life just one more lie?

Grantaire glares at Enjolras and enters the cafe.

ALL

Drink with me

To days gone by!

To the life

That used to be!

At the shrine of friendship

Never say die...

Let the wine of friendship

Never run dry!

Here's to you

And here's to me!

Valjean is moving through the cafe when he hears Marius

through a window. He moves to the window. Marius sits beneath

it.

MARIUS

Do I care if I should die

Now she goes across the sea?

Life without Cosette

Means nothing at all..

Please don't weep, Cosette,

Should Marius fall.

Will you weep, Cosette,

For me?

Valjean listens to Marius's song, and he's moved.

Look-outs keep watch at either end of the barricaded

street. Many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping.

Valjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe. Dead

bodies are lined up on the ground floor. He comes to a

stop, and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window.

VALJEAN

God on high

Hear my prayer

(more)

103.

VALJEAN (cont'd)

In my need

You have always been there.

He is young

He's afraid

Let him rest

Heaven blessed.

Bring him home

Bring him home

Bring him home!

He's like the son I might have

known

If God had granted me a son.

The summers die

One by one

How soon they fly

On and on

And I am old

And will be gone.

Bring him peace

Bring him joy

He is young

He is only a boy.

You can take

You can give

Let him be

Let him live,

If I die, let me die

Let him live

Bring him home

Bring him home

Bring him home!

Valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping Marius.

CRANE UP AND UP - Seeing the little world of the barricaded

street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets

round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many

that we know the little band can never win.

CRANE UP AND UP until the barricade and the army that

entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the

centre of the bright lights of Paris.

The sun still below the rooftops. Every house is tightly

shuttered.

Grantaire is fast asleep in the upstairs room, dead drunk.

104.

Enjolras re-enters the barricade through the secret gate.

He has been on a reconnaissance. He looks at the street. No

one is stirring, but for a single shutter which opens a

crack - a face peeps - and it closes again. Below him the

students are up and getting ready.

ENJOLRAS

The people have not stirred.

COURFEYRAC

Yet we will not abandon those

Who still live in fear.

ENJOLRAS

The people have not heard,

Yet we will not abandon those who

cannot hear.

Let us not waste lives!

Let all who wish to

Go from here!

There is silence. Uncertainty. Yet no one moves to go.

GAVROCHE

(from top of barricade)

Do you hear the people sing

GAVROCHE/COURFEYRAC

Singing the song of angry men

STUDENTS/CITIZENS

(joining)

It is the music of the people

Who will not be slaves again

When the beating of your heart

Echoes the beating of the drums

There is a life about to start

When tomorrow comes!

Under this:

FEUILLY

Enjolras! Ammunition's short.

MARIUS

I will go into the streets.

There are bodies all around.

Ammunition to be had.

Lots of bullets to be found.

ENJOLRAS

I can't let you go.

105.

VALJEAN

Let me go!

He's no more than a boy.

I am old.

I have nothing to fear.

GAVROCHE

I volunteer!

COURFEYRAC

Come back, Gavroche! Don't you

dare!

JOLY

Someone pull him down right now!

GAVROCHE

Look at me, I'm almost there!

GAVROCHE

Little people know

When little people fight

We may look easy pickings

But we've got some bite!

So never kick a dog

When he's just a pup -

We'll fight like twenty armies

And we won't give up!

GAVROCHE

So you'd better run for cover

When the pup grows -

COURFEYRAC

No-o!

106.

ARMY OFFICER

You at the barricades listen to

this!

The people of Paris sleep in

their beds!

You have no chance,

No chance at all!

Why throw your lives away?

ENJOLRAS

Let us die facing our foes!

Make them bleed while we can!

COMBEFERRE

Make'em pay through the nose!

COURFEYRAC

Make'em pay for every man!

ENJOLRAS

Let others rise to take our place

Until the earth is free!

107.

Students and soldiers fight in the cafe, on the stairs, up

the stairs to the upper room. Students driving back the

pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it

to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them -

students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants

of the stairs. Grantaire is still unconscious from drink.

Valjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the

onrush of the soldiers -

The students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling

sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to

clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the

students are falling.

Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. A soldier

challenges him. One violent blow from Valjean sends the

soldier flying -

The soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find

there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window,

knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him the

soldiers hesitate. The sudden silence wakes Grantaire from

his drunken slumber.

GRANTAIRE

Long live the republic!

He sees Enjolras with the muskets raised against him.

Grantaire goes and joins him. Enjolras smiles, and raises his

now-ragged red flag.

The rifles blaze. Grantaire drops back to the ground.

Enjolras falls back -

Enjolras falling backwards out of the window, until he

hangs upside down, the red flag still in his hands,

streaming like blood down the wall.

108.

PULL BACK to see the street littered with corpses, and the

remains of the barricade, and soldiers scouring the rubble

for any last pockets of resistance.

BACK AND BACK to come to a stop looking at the wide scene.

INTO FRAME walks Javert, grimly surveying the victory of

law over rebellion.

Valjean carries Marius down a long narrow alley that runs

between the backs of tall houses. The alley turns a corner -

and there ahead is a dead end. Behind him, the stamp of

soldiers' boots. Ahead, no way out.

Then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the

ground. A storm drain.

ON THE SOLDIERS - As they come round the corner into the

end of the alley. They look round. It's empty.

SOLDIER

Nothing here!

The soldiers depart. A moment of silence.

Then into the alley's end steps Javert. Not so easily

fooled. He walks all the way to the end, and looks round.

He sees the drain at his feet. He sees the signs that the

grating has been lifted.

He stoops, and tries to lift it. It's far too heavy for

him.

He straightens up and looks round, calculating. Where does

the drain lead?

Valjean is pulling Marius after him down a tight sloping

pipe, where dark water races. Suddenly they start to slide,

then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel. Faint

light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls. The

skitter of rats. Sodden forms floating by: dead bodies.

Valjean carries Marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as

he can, losing strength all the time. He reaches an

intersection where four sewers meet. Light falls through

distant gratings. One of the four sewers is dry. Here he

lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy ground

to rest. He lets his eyes close.

A voice echoes in the shadows.

109.

THENARDIER

Here's a hint of gold

Stuck into a tooth -

Pardon me, m'sieur,

You won't be needing it no more.

Shouldn't be too hard to sell.

THENARDIER

Well, someone's got to clean'em

up, my friends,

Before the little harvest

Disappears into the mud.

Someone's got to collect their

odds and ends

When the gutters run with blood.

THENARDIER

Here's a tasty ring

Pretty little thing

Heart's no longer going

And he's lived his little time,

But his watch is ticking yet.

It's a world where the dog eats

the dog.

Where they kill for the bones in

the street.

And God in his heaven,

He don't interfere

Cos he's dead as the stiff at my

feet!

I raise my eyes to see the

heavens

And only the moon looks down.

The harvest moon shines down!

VALJEAN

How do I get out of here?

THENARDIER

There! That way!

110.

As he feels himself sink, Valjean holds Marius up in his

arms and forges on, chest deep, lifting the younger man

above his head. Still he sinks, until his face is half-

submerged and he's gagging in the filth. He stumbles, and

suddenly he's sunk beneath the surface, and Marius is

dropping -

Then up he bursts again, face black with slime, eyes

burning with his refusal to be beaten.

LATER - Valjean staggers down the endless sewers, Marius on

his back. But all the time he can hear, closer now, the

rushing sound of the river.

Round a bend and at last - moonlight ahead.

He drags himself on through the shallow running water

towards the moonlight.

He reaches the exit at last. Before him the river.

Valjean, crusted with slime, heaves Marius out of the sewer

onto the embankment that runs beside the river.

He looks up. There, staring at him, is Javert.

Valjean rises slowly. Heaves Marius up onto his back once

more. The strain of the night is showing. He's a man near

the end of his strength.

VALJEAN

It's you, Javert!

I knew you wouldn't wait too

long.

The faithful servant at his post

once more.

This man's done no wrong.

And he needs his family's care.

JAVERT

I warned you I would not give in!

I won't be swayed!

VALJEAN

Another hour yet

And then I'm yours

And all our debts are paid.

JAVERT

The man of mercy comes again

And talks of justice!

111.

VALJEAN

Come, time is running short -

Look down, Javert!

He's standing in his grave!

JAVERT

One more step and you die.

VALJEAN

Then I die.

JAVERT

Take him, Valjean,

Before I change my mind!

I will be waiting...

24601!

JAVERT

Who is this man?

What sort of devil is he?

To have caught me in a trap

And choose to let me go free?

It was his hour at last

To put a seal on my fate

Wipe out the past

And wash me clean off the slate!

All it would take

Was a flick of his knife

Vengeance was his

And he gave me back my life!

JAVERT

Damned if I live in the debt of a

thief!

Damned if I yield at the end of

the chase!

(more)

112.

JAVERT (cont'd)

I am the law and the law is not

mocked!

I'll spit his pity right back in

his face!

There is nothing on earth that we

share!

It is either Valjean or Javert!

How can I allow this man

To hold dominion over me?

This desperate man that I have

hunted...

He gave me my life! He gave me

freedom!

I should have perished by his

hand

It was his right...

It was my right to die as well...

Instead I live... But live in

hell!

JAVERT

And my thoughts fly apart

Can this man be believed?

Shall his sins be forgiven?

Shall his crimes be reprieved?

And must I now begin to doubt

Who never doubted all those

years?

My heart is stone and still it

trembles...

The world I have known is lost in

shadow

Is he from heaven or from hell?

And does he know

That granting me my life today

This man has killed me even so?

JAVERT

I am reaching but I fall

And the stars are black and cold

As I stare into the void

Of a world that cannot hold...

I'll escape now from that world

From the world of Jean Valjean

This is nowhere I can turn...

There is no way to go on...

113.

He reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he

wants some angel from on high to save him - and so,

turning, he falls into the river. The swirling eddies close

over him. And he's lost.

Soldiers are dismantling the last of the barricade. Women

move about the street, seeking their dead loved ones among

the bodies that still litter the barricade. These are both

the middle-class mothers of the students - Enjolras's

mother, Grantaire's sister - and the working women of the

slums for whom they died, united now in their grief.

WOMAN 1

Did you see them

Going off to fight?

WOMAN 2

Children of the barricade

Who didn't last the night.

WOMAN 3

Did you see them

Lying where they died?

Someone used to cradle them

And kiss them when they cried.

WOMAN 4

Did you see them lying side by

side?

WOMAN 5

Who will wake them?

WOMAN 6

No one ever will.

WOMAN 2

No one ever told them that

A summer day can kill.

WOMAN 7

They were schoolboys

Never held a gun

Fighting for a new world that

Would rise up like the sun.

WOMAN 3

Where's that new world

Now the fighting's done?

The women move off to go about their day's business.

114.

CLOSE ON MARIUS - He's waking from the nightmare, finding

himself in a fine bed, with clean linen. He looks round: a

handsome room.

GILLENORMAND

Marius! You've come back to us!

Marius recognises the old man anxiously watching him: his

grandfather, Monsieur GILLENORMAND.

MARIUS

Grandfather...

He struggles to rise, but he lacks the strength. His

grandfather's face shows only love and concern.

GILLENORMAND

Rest, Marius. No more harsh words

between us. I just thank God

you're alive.

Timidly the old man comes closer to the bed. Tears form in

Marius's eyes. Encouraged, the old man takes Marius's hand

in his.

GILLENORMAND

You've come home. To all of us.

The distant voices of the mourning women -

WOMEN (O.S.)

Round and round

And back where you began...

Marius makes his way slowly up the stairs to the upper

room. He's still weak from his wounds. He enters the room

where his friends died, and looks round. He sinks into a

chair.

MARIUS

There's a grief that can't be

spoken

There's a pain goes on and on

Empty chairs at empty tables

Now my friends are dead and gone.

He sees the bloodstain on the wall beneath the window sill.

The blood of Enjolras.

MARIUS

Here they talked of revolution

Here it was they lit the flame

Here they sang about tomorrow

(more)

115.

MARIUS (cont'd)

And tomorrow never came...

From the table in the corner

They could see a world reborn

And they rose with voices ringing

And I can hear them now!

The very words that they had sung

Became their last communion

On the lonely barricade at dawn.

He looks out of the window at what's left of the barricade.

He seems to see again the brave doomed defence, the smoke

and the gunfire, the young men falling.

MARIUS

Oh my friends, my friends,

forgive me

That I live and you are gone

There's a grief that can't be

spoken

There's a pain goes on and on...

Phantom faces at the window

Phantom shadows on the floor

Empty chairs at empty tables

Where my friends will meet no

more.

Oh my friends, my friends, don't

ask me

What your sacrifice was for

Empty chairs at empty tables

Where my friends will sing no

more.

Slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway.

There stands Cosette, waiting for him.

Cosette holds Marius, supporting him, as he enters the

house.

COSETTE

Every day

You walk with stronger step,

You walk with longer step.

The worst is over.

MARIUS

Every day

I wonder every day

Who it was brought me here

From the barricade.

Cosette leads him into the room where Valjean and

Gillenormand wait.

116.

COSETTE

Don't think about it, Marius!

With all the years ahead of us!

I will never go away

And we will be together

Every day.

Every day

We'll remember that night

And the vow that we made.

As Valjean and Gillenormand look on, Marius and Cosette

sing their love to each other.

COSETTE

A heart full of love

A night full of you

The words are old

But always true.

VALJEAN

She was never mine to keep

She is youthful, she is free...

MARIUS

Cosette, Cosette!

COSETTE

I saw you waiting and I knew -

GILLENORMAND

Thank God, thank God you are here!

Thank God, thank God you are home!

MARIUS

Waiting for you!

At your feet!

COSETTE

At your call!

VALJEAN/GILLENORMAND

Love is the garden of the young

Let it be

Let it be!

A heart full of love

This I give you this day.

MARIUS/COSETTE

And it wasn't a dream

Not a dream after all.

Marius stands before Valjean, alone in this more private

room.

117.

MARIUS

M'sieur, this is a day

I never can forget.

Is gratitude enough

For giving me Cosette?

Your home shall be with us

And not a day shall pass

But we will prove our love

To you, whom we shall call

A father to us both,

A father to us all.

VALJEAN

Not another word, my son.

There's something now that must

be done...

VALJEAN

There lived a man whose name was

Jean Valjean.

He stole some bread to save his

sister's son

For nineteen winters served his

time

In sweat he washed away his

crime.

VALJEAN

Years ago,

He broke parole and lived a life

apart...

How could he tell Cosette and

break her heart?

It's for Cosette this must be

faced:

If he is caught, she is

disgraced...

The time has come to journey on,

And from this day he must be

gone!

Who am I?

Who am I?

MARIUS

You're Jean Valjean!

118.

MARIUS

Monsieur, you cannot leave!

Whatever I tell my beloved

Cosette

She will never believe me.

VALJEAN

Make her believe

I have gone on a journey

A long way away.

Tell her my heart was too full

for farewells -

It is better this way.

Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette

will never know...

MARIUS

I give my word.

VALJEAN

...What I have spoken, why I must

go.

MARIUS

For the sake of Cosette, it must

be so.

A waiting cab. Valjean comes out of the modest lodging

house and gets in. The cab rattles away down the street.

IN THE CAB - Valjean sits gazing far away at nothing. Then

his weary eyes close.

Cosette gazes at Marius, bewildered by what she has just

learned.

COSETTE

Where's he gone without a word

That wouldn't be his way to go

MARIUS

All he asked for me to   say

He's on a journey, far   away.

Dear Cosette, he loves   you so

Perhaps he will return   some day.

Cosette comes into Marius's arms, tears in her eyes.

COSETTE

He can't leave us now

What's our wedding day

Without him giving me away?

"LES MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012          119.

Marius and Cosette, newly married, are walking towards

Marius' house through an aisle created by wedding guests.

Carriages line the street.

WEDDING GUESTS

Ring out the bells

Upon this day of days!

May all the angels

Of the Lord above

In jubilation

Sing their songs of praise!

And crown this blessed time

With peace and love!

Waltz music plays as Marius and Cosette lead the dancing at

the wedding reception.

As the dance proceeds, two extraordinary figures enter, and

start helping themselves to the drink and the food. They

are Thenardier and his wife, dressed up for high society.

MAJORDOMO

The Baron and Baroness du Thenard

They look round as the dance continues, highly satisfied with

themselves and see Marius.

Thenardier makes a mock-formal bow.

THENARDIER

I forget where we met...

Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge

Where the Duke did that Puke

Down the Duchess's decolletage?

MARIUS

No, `Baron du Thenard',

The circles I move in are humbler

by far...

Go away, Thenardier!

Do you think I don't know who you

are?

MADAME THENARDIER

He's not fooled!

Told you so!

Show M'Sieur what you've come here

to show.

Tell the boy what you know!

THENARDIER

Pity to disturb you at a feast

like this

But 500 francs surely wouldn't

come amiss.

MARIUS

In God's name say what you have

to say.

MADAME THENARDIER

(to Thenardier)

He speaks.

(to Marius)

You pay!

THENARDIER

What I saw, clear as light,

Jean Valjean in the sewers that

night,

Had this corpse on his back

Some boy he'd killed in a viscious

attack.

I was there, never fear!

Even found me this fine souvenir!

He shows off his ring. Marius stares in astonishment.

MARIUS

I know this! This was mine!

This is surely some heavenly sign!

Thenardier steals the ring back.

THENARDIER

And there's more! Mark this well -

It was the night that the

barricades fell.

MARIUS

Then it's true! Then I'm right!

Jean Valjean was my saviour that

night!

Thenardier looks past Marius to where Cosette stands among

their friends. He lowers his voice.

THENARDIER

Jean Valjean - the old con.

You pay up and I'll say where he's

gone.

He takes out money and reluctantly presses it into

Thenardier's hands. Madame Thenardier takes the money before

Thenardier has safely pocketed it.

MARIUS

Not so loud! Here's for you.

God forgive us the things that we

do.

MADAME THENARDIER

How's about some extra

On a day so glad

Our little orphan girl

She hasn't done so bad.

Raised in a convent

Cash to spare -

We want our share.

Marius hands over yet more money to Madame Thenardier.

THENARDIER

Quite the little nun, ain't she!

CRACK! Thenardier sinks to the ground, felled by a powerful

blow from an angered Marius. The band stops playing.

MARIUS

Where is he?

THENARDIER

(cowardly voice)

The convent.

Marius rushes to Cosette and we see him telling her where

Valjean is. They hurry away.

Thenardier clambers to his feet, helped by his wife. He

gestures to the band to continue. They stand by the tiered

wedding cake. As Thenardier recovers his composure, Madame

Thenardier steals one then two pillars from the cake so it

collapses on the floor. She then pushes it under the table

with her foot.

THENARDIER

Ain't it a laugh?

Ain't it a treat?

Hob-nobbin' here

Among the elite?

Here comes a prince

There goes a Jew

This one's a queer

But what can you do?

(pulling Madame Thenardier

onto the dance floor)

Paris at my feet!

Paris in the dust!

And here's me breaking bread

With the upper crust -

As he pivots Madame Thenardier, stolen silver drops out from

Madame Thenardier's dress. The music stops dead in the

clatter. The Thenardiers look up, as if implying that the

silver dropped from the ceiling. The dance continues.

Monsieur Gillenormand motions to the Majordomo to remove

these unwanted guests.

THENARDIER

Beggar at the feast!

Master of the dance!

Life is easy pickings

If you grab your chance!

MADAME THENARDIER

Everywhere you go

Law-abiding folk

Doing what is decent

THENARDIER

But they're mostly broke!

MADAME THENARDIER

Singing to the Lord on Sundays

THENARDIER

Praying for the gifts he'll send -

THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER

But we're the ones who take it -

We're the ones who make it in the

end!

The Thenardiers are carried off, singing as they go.

THENARDIER

Watch the buggers dance

MADAME THENARDIER

Watch'em till they drop!

THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER

Keep your wits about you

And you stand on top!

THENARDIER

Masters of the land

MADAME THENARDIER

Always get our share

THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER

Clear away the barricades

And we're still there!

We know where the wind is blowing

Money is the stuff we smell -

And when we're rich as Croesus,

Jesus! Won't we see you all in

hell!

As they are thrown out, the Thenardiers steal a tiara and a

candlestick.

"LES MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012          122.

IN ON A WINDOW - Where two candle burn.

Valjean prays in the chapel, on his knees. He's very weak.

Next to the crucifix on the altar are Valjean's two silver

candlesticks, in which two candles burn.

VALJEAN

Alone I wait in the shadows

I count the hours till I can

sleep.

I dreamed a dream Cosette stood

by

It made her weep

To know I die...

Alone at the end of the day

Upon this wedding night I pray

Take these children, my Lord, to

thy embrace

And show them grace...

God on high

Hear my prayer

Take me now

To thy care

Where you are

Let me be

Take me now

Take me there

Bring me home

Bring me home!

VALJEAN is joined by the ghost of Fantine. She takes his hand

as he prays.

FANTINE

M'sieur I bless your name...

VALJEAN

I am ready, Fantine...

FANTINE

M'sieur lay down your burden...

123.

VALJEAN

At the end of my days...

FANTINE

You raised my child in love,

VALJEAN

She's the best of my life...

FANTINE

And you will be with God.

Cosette and Marius rush round the cloisters and enter the

chapel in the middle of the cloisters.

The sound of the door opening. Valjean looks round. It's

Cosette entering, followed by Marius.

VALJEAN

Cosette?

Tears form in his eyes. Cosette goes to him, kneels before

him, takes him in her arms.

COSETTE

Papa, papa, I do not understand -

Are you all right? Why did you go

away?

VALJEAN

Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven

now?

Thank God, thank God, I've lived

to see this day!

Marius comes to him.

MARIUS

It's you who must forgive a

thoughtless fool!

It's you who must forgive a

thankless man!

It's thanks to you that I am

living,

And again I lay down my life at

your feet.

Cosette, your father is a saint!

When they wounded me

He took me from the barricade,

Carried like a babe,

And brought me home to you!

124.

VALJEAN

Now you are here

Again beside me

Now I can die in peace

For now my life is blessed...

COSETTE

You will live, papa

You're going to live

It's too soon

Too soon to say goodbye.

VALJEAN

Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to

die!

I'll obey

I will try...

VALJEAN

On this page

I write my last confession.

Read it well

When I at last am sleeping.

It's the story

Of one who turned from hating

A man who only learned to love

When you were in his keeping.

COSETTE

I know it, papa.

VALJEAN

I'm ready now, Fantine.

FANTINE

Come with me

Where chains will never bind you

All your grief

At last, at last behind you

Lord in heaven

Look down on him in mercy -

VALJEAN

Forgive me all my trespasses

And take me to your glory!

125.

Cosette embraces Valjean, weeping.

Valjean reaches up his hands, and lets the ghost of Fantine

take them.

FANTINE/EPONINE

Take my hand

I'll lead you to salvation

Take my love

For love is everlasting...

VALJEAN/FANTINE/EPONINE/BISHOP

And remember

The truth that once was spoken:

To love another person

Is to see the face of God...

Led by Fantine, Valjean walks out of the Chapel towards the

cloister.

What remains is Cosette, her head cradled in the lap of the

man who has just died.

The walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles.

The Bishop of Digne waits in front of the candles. Now

Valjean's strong and young again. Before they reach the

wall of candles, all three are gone.

As they disappear we CRANE UP, high over the cloister, high

over the walls of the Convent and we see the Paris streets

outside. Fires are burning and debris is scattered in the

streets. Dawn is breaking.

From far away, the sound of an approaching crowd -

THE CAMERA MOVES over the cobbles as the light of the

rising sun reveals the devastation left by a bitter street

battle. Past the remains of a barricade.

The distant sound of an approaching march.

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

Sixteen years later

Paris, 1848.

From far off, the swelling sounds of the approaching march

become the words of a song.

MARCHERS

Do you hear the people sing

Lost in the valley of the night?

It is the music of a people

Who are climbing to the light

For the wretched of the earth

(more)

126.

MARCHERS (cont'd)

There is a flame that never dies

Even the darkest night will end

And the sun will rise.

The people of Paris have risen in

their tens of thousands.

The King has fled. A new Republic

is born.

MARCHERS

They will live again in freedom

In the garden of the Lord

They will walk behind the plough-

share

They will put away the sword

The chain will be broken

And all men will have their

reward!

MARCHERS

Will you join in our crusade?

Who will be strong and stand with

me?

Somewhere beyond the barricade

Is there a world you long to see?

MARCHERS

Do you hear the people sing?

Say, do you hear the distant

drums?

(more)

127.

MARCHERS (cont'd)

It is the future that they bring

When tomorrow comes!

MARCHERS

Will you join in our crusade?

Somewhere beyond the barricade

Tomorrow comes!
