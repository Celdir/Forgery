An American Werewolf in London

2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

CUT TO:

TRUCK DRIVER

Here, lads, East Proctor and

all about are the moors.  I go

east here.

JACK

Yes, well thank you very much

for the ride, sir.  You have

lovely sheep.

TRUCK DRIVER

(as he clambers back

up on his truck)

Boys, keep off the moors.

Stay on the road.  Good luck

to you.

DAVID

Thanks again!

JACK

Are you cold?

DAVID

Yes.

JACK

Good.

DAVID

Jack.

JACK

David.

DAVID

You're not having a good time

are you?

JACK

Oh, I don't know.  I mean look

around.  Isn't this a fun

place?

DAVID

Well, I like it here.

JACK

I'm sorry.  Northern England

first, Italy later.

DAVID

Right.

JACK

Do you think she'll meet me in

Rome?

DAVID

I think Debbie Klein is a

mediocre person with a good

body.

JACK

Debbie is not mediocre and she

has one of the great bodies of

all time.

DAVID

She's a jerk.

JACK

You're talking about the woman

I love.

DAVID

I'm talking about a girl you

want to fuck, so give me a

break.

JACK

Well, anyway, do you think

she'll be there?

DAVID

I don't know.

JACK

(like an announcer)

Rendezvous in Rome starring

Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein.

The love affair that shocked

Europe!  See torrid lovemaking

at its most explicit!  See

Jack and Debbie expose their

lust in the sacred halls of

the Vatican!  Never has the

screen dared....

DAVID

If you don't stop, I'm going

to kill you.

JACK

I have to make love to her.

It's very simple.  She has no

choice really.

DAVID

It just fascinates me that you

can spend so much energy on

someone so dull.

JACK

It is impossible for a body

like that to be dull.

DAVID

We've known Debbie what, since

the eighth grade?  How many

years of foreplay is that?

JACK

She says she `likes me too

much'.

DISSOLVE

TO:

3    EXT. EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT

4    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

JACK

The Slaughtered Lamb?

DAVID

Of course, The Slaughtered

Lamb.  Why else would they

have a severed fox head on a

spear as their symbol?

JACK

That's a wolf's head.

DAVID

Of course, The Slaughtered

Lamb.  Why else would they

have a severed wolf's head on

a spear as their symbol?

JACK

That's not a spear.  It's a

pike.

DAVID

A severed wolf's head on a

pike as their symbol.

JACK

David, before we go in there I

want you to know that - no

matter what happens to us -

it's your fault.

DAVID

I assume full responsibility.

JACK

Okay.

DAVID

Shall we?

5    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

DAVID

Hello.

JACK

Nice to see you.

CUT TO:

DAVID

(smiles)

It's very cold outside.  May

we come in?

JACK

Do you have any hot soup?

WOMAN

No.

DAVID

Well, do you have any coffee?

WOMAN

No.

JACK

Hot chocolate?

WOMAN

We've got spirits and beer.

If it's something hot you

want, you can have tea.

JACK

Then you have some hot tea?

WOMAN

No.

JACK

Oh.

WOMAN

But I can heat some up for you

if you'd like.

DAVID & JACK

Yes, please.

JACK

Nice looking group.

DAVID

Listen, at least it's warm in

here.

JACK

Look at that.

CUT TO:

DAVID

What about it?

JACK

It's a five-pointed star.

DAVID

Maybe the owners are from

Texas.

JACK

(to Woman)

Remember the Alamo?

WOMAN

I beg your pardon?

DAVID

He was joking.  Thank you.

WOMAN

Joking?  I remember The Alamo.

I saw it once in London, in

Leicester Square.

CHESS PLAYER

She means in the cinema, that

film with John Wayne.

(turns to board)

Checkmate.

DAVID

Oh, yes, of course.

JACK

Right, with Laurence Harvey

and everybody died in it.  It

was very bloody.

CHESS PLAYER

Bloody awful if you ask me!

CHESS PLAYER

Here, Gladys, Tom.  Did you

hear the one about the

crashing plane?

WOMAN

No, but we're about to.

CHESS PLAYER

You be quiet, woman, and let

me speak.

WOMAN

(heavy sarcasm)

Quiet, everyone!  Hush!  Shhh!

CHESS PLAYER

All right, laugh then.  I

shan't tell it.

WOMAN

Oh, come on, tell us.

CHESS PLAYER

No.  You've had your chance.

JACK

(to David)

Ask them what the candles are

for.

DAVID

(to Jack)

You ask them.

JACK

(to David)

Listen, that's a pentangle, a

five-pointed star.  It's used

in witchcraft.  Lon Chaney,

Jr. and Universal Studios

maintain it's the mark of the

wolf man.

DAVID

(to Jack)

I see.  You want me to ask

these people if they're

burning candles to ward off

monsters.

JACK

(to David)

Right.

DAVID

(to Jack)

Wrong.

CHESS PLAYER

Oh, all right.  There was this

airplane over the Atlantic on

its way to New York.  It was

full of men from the United

Nations.

WOMAN

That's very funny, that is.

JACK

(to David)

Go on, ask them.

DAVID

(to Jack)

You ask them.

CHESS PLAYER

Here now, let me finish!  So

halfway over the ocean the

engines run low on petrol so

they have to lighten the

plane.  So they heave out all

the baggage, but it's still

too heavy.  So they chuck out

the seats, but it's still too

heavy!  Finally this Froggy

steps up and shouts "Viva la

France" and leaps out.  Then

an Englishman....

DART PLAYERS

Hear!  Hear!

CHESS PLAYER

(undaunted)

...steps up and shouts `God

save the Queen!' and leaps

out.  But the plane is still

too heavy.  So the Yank

delegate from Texas steps up,

shouts, `Remember the Alamo!'

and chucks out the Mexican.

DART PLAYER

Remember the Alamo!

JACK

Excuse me, but what's that

star on the wall for?

DART PLAYER

(angry)

You've made me miss.

JACK

I'm sorry.

DART PLAYER

I've never missed the board

before.

DAVID

Jack, we'd better go.

JACK

What do you mean?  I'm

starving.

DART PLAYER

There's no food here.

DAVID

Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!

JACK

Apparently so.

WOMAN

(to men)

You can't let them go.

DAVID

(worried)

How much do we owe you?

CHESS PLAYER

Nothing, lads.  Go, God be

with you.

DAVID

Uh, thank you.

WOMAN

Wait!  You just can't let them

go!

DART PLAYER

Go!  And stay on the road.

Keep clear of the moors.

DAVID

Yes, well, thanks again.

CHESS PLAYER

Beware the moon, lads!

6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

JACK

What the hell was that all

about?

DAVID

I don't know.  Let's see if

there's an inn or something up

the road.

JACK

Beware the moon?

DAVID

Come on, I'm freezing.

7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

WOMAN

You can't let them go.

DART PLAYER

(angry)

Should the world know our

business?!

CHESS PLAYER

It's murder then.

DART PLAYER

Then murder it is!  It's in

God's hands now.

DISSOLVE

TO:

8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK

DAVID

That was weird.  I guess

leaving was the best idea.

JACK

I don't know.  Now that we're

out here and it's three

degrees, I'm not so sure I

wouldn't rather face a blood-

thirsty mob.

DAVID

Well, not quite a blood-

thirsty mob.

JACK

What do you think was wrong?

DAVID

I have no idea.

JACK

Maybe that pentangle was for

something supernatural.

DAVID

I see and they were too

embarrassed to talk about it,

because they felt so silly.

DAVID

Please don't rain.

DAVID

Of course.

JACK

Say, David....

DAVID

I'm well aware of how pleasant

the weather is in Rome at the

present time thank you.

JACK

Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia.

9    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

WOMAN

Perhaps they'll be safe in the

rain.

CHESS PLAYER

No one brought them here!  No

one wanted them here!

WOMAN

You could have told them!

DART PLAYER

Are you daft?  What do you

think they'd say?  They'd

think us mad.

WOMAN

Listen!

WOMAN

Did you hear it?  We must go

to them.

DART PLAYER

I heard nothing.

CHESS PLAYER

Nor I.

10   EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

JACK

Did you hear that?

DAVID

I heard that.

JACK

What was it?

DAVID

Could be a lot of things.

JACK

Yeah?

DAVID

A coyote.

JACK

There aren't any coyotes in

England.

DAVID

The Hound of the Baskervilles.

JACK

Pecos Bill.

DAVID

Heathcliffe.

JACK

Heathcliffe didn't howl.

DAVID

No, but he was on the moors.

JACK

It's a full moon, `beware the

moon'.

JACK

I vote we go back to The

Slaughtered Lamb.

DAVID

Yeah.

DAVID

We're lost.

JACK

Shit!  David, what is that?

DAVID

I don't know.  Come on.

JACK

Come on, where?

DAVID

Anywhere!  I think we should

just keep moving.

DAVID

It's moving.

JACK

It's circling us.

JACK

Fuck.

DAVID

What's the plan?

JACK

(nervously)

Plan?

DAVID

(not too relaxed

himself)

Let's just keep walking.

DAVID

That's right, a lovely stroll

in the moors.  Tra-la-la,

isn't this fun?

DAVID

It's in front of us.

JACK

Do you think it's a dog?

JACK

Oh shit.  What is that?

DAVID

A sheep dog or something.

Turn slowly and let's walk

away.

JACK

Nice doggie.  Good boy.

DAVID

Walk away, Jack.

JACK

Walking away, yes, sir.  Here

we are walking away.

DAVID

See anything?

JACK

No.

DAVID

It sounds far away.

JACK

Not far enough.  Come on.

DAVID

Jack?

JACK

Yeah.

DAVID

Where are we going?

JACK

I'll tell you when we get

there.

DAVID

Well.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!!

JACK

You really scared me, you

shithead.

DAVID

Are you going to help me up?

JACK

Jesus fuck!  David!  Please

help me!  Please!  David!

Shit!  Help me!  Oh God!

DAVID

Jack?  Oh my God, Jack!

DAVID

Jack....

FADE OUT

11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

DAVID

Jack?!

ALEX

Mr. Kessler?

ALEX

Mr. Kessler?

MISS GALLAGHER

He all right?

ALEX

Yes, I should think.  He

called out just now.

MISS GALLAGHER

He's an American, you know.

Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch

round one of those Embassy

fellows to see him.

ALEX

Chart says he's from New York.

MISS GALLAGHER

I think he's a Jew.

ALEX

Why on earth do you say that?

MISS GALLAGHER

I looked.

ALEX

(smiles)

Really, Susan, I don't think

that was very proper, and

besides, it's common practice

now.

DR. HIRSCH

Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss

Price is quite right.

ALEX

Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried

out a minute ago.

DR. HIRSCH

Miss Gallagher, surely you

must perform some function

here at the hospital.

MISS GALLAGHER

Yes, Doctor.

DR. HIRSCH

Then get on with it.

MISS GALLAGHER

Yes, Doctor.

DR. HIRSCH

Can I be of service, Miss

Price?

ALEX

Dr. Hirsch?

DR. HIRSCH

Go about your duties.

ALEX

Yes, Doctor.

DR. HIRSCH

Oh, Miss Price?

ALEX

Yes, Doctor?

DR. HIRSCH

What exactly did he call out?

ALEX

He said `Jack'.

DR. HIRSCH

That would be Jack Goodman,

the boy who was killed.

ALEX

What happened to them?

DR. HIRSCH

The police report said an

escaped lunatic attacked them.

He must have been a very

powerful man.  Although I

really don't see that it is

any of your concern, Miss

Price.

ALEX

No, sir.  Of course, sir.

Good day, Doctor.

12   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

CUT TO:

13   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

DR. HIRSCH

Hello, David.  I am Dr. Hirsch

and this is a countryman of

yours, Mr. Collins.

DAVID

Where am I?

DR. HIRSCH

You're in a hospital in

London.

DAVID

London?  Where's Jack?  I had

a strange dream.

DR. HIRSCH

I should think so after your

recent traumatic experiences.

DAVID

The guy I was with.  Is he all

right?  How did I get to

London?

DR. HIRSCH

(quietly)

Now, David, I want you to

prepare yourself; your friend

is dead.

DAVID

What?

DAVID

Ow, shit!

DAVID

Jack's dead?

MR. COLLINS

Mr. Kessler, I am Mr. Collins

of the American Embassy here

in Grosvenor Square.  Both Mr.

Goodman's parents and your

parents have been notified of

your injuries and everything's

in order.

DAVID

Everything's in order?  What

are you talking about?

MR. COLLINS

Mr. Goodman's body has been

air-freighted back to New York

for burial and your parents

have wired funds for your stay

in the hospital until you are

well enough to fly home.

DAVID

(controlled tears)

You don't crate and ship Jack

like some side of beef.

(approaching hysteria)

Who the hell are you people?

What's going on here?  Where

is Jack?  I demand to see him!

DR. HIRSCH

(holds David down,

calls out)

Miss Price!  Miss Price,

please!

DAVID

(shouting)

Get your fucking hands off me!

What the hell is going on

here?

MR. COLLINS

(distraught, clutching

his briefcase)

I realize how upsetting this

must be for you, Mr. Kessler,

but please try to refrain from

hysterics.

DR. HIRSCH

Prepare a hypodermic, please,

Miss Price.

MR. COLLINS

Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to

excite yourself.  Everything

has been arranged.  I shall

come back to check on your

progress and send a report to

your parents.  The police have

requested to interview you and

I have given them permission

to do so.

DR. HIRSCH

Thank you very much, Mr.

Collins.  He'll rest now and

I'm sure everything will be

fine once he's adjusted.  He's

had quite a shock.

MR. COLLINS

These dumb-ass kids never

appreciate anything you do for

them.

DAVID

How long have I been here?

DR. HIRSCH

You've been unconscious since

you were brought in two weeks

ago.

DAVID

Two weeks?

DR. HIRSCH

You've suffered some rather

severe cuts and bruises, lost

a bit of blood, but nothing

too serious; black and blue

for a while.  You'll have some

dueling scars to boast of.

That lunatic must have been a

very fierce fellow.  They say

a mad man has the strength of

ten.

DAVID

(softly, as the drugs

take hold)

Lunatic?

DR. HIRSCH

Now we've just given you a

pretty strong sedative, so try

to get some rest now.  Miss

Price will see to your needs.

Rest now.

DAVID

(softly)

It wasn't a lunatic.

ALEX

(puzzled)

I beg your pardon?

DAVID

It was a wolf.

ALEX

(bends down close

to hear)

What?

DAVID

A wolf.

DR. HIRSCH

Did he say a wolf?

ALEX

Yes, I believe he did.

14   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

DR. HIRSCH

But Roger is so terribly

boring.  Yes, dear, but

couldn't we...I see.

(he makes a note)

Thursday at eight, dinner with

boring Roger.  Yes, I'm sure I

will; if I survived Rommel, I

suppose I'll survive another

excruciating evening with

Roger Mathison.  Be a good

girl.  Bye.

DR. HIRSCH

Yes?

SECRETARY (V.O.)

Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus

are here to see you, Doctor.

DR. HIRSCH

Send them in.

LT. VILLIERS

Dr. Hirsch?

DR. HIRSCH

Come in, come in.  Please sit.

Some tea?

LT. VILLIERS

No, thank you.

SGT. McMANUS

I'd like some tea, please.

SGT. McMANUS

Maybe not.  No thanks.  Maybe

later.

DR. HIRSCH

It's no problem.

LT. VILLIERS

No, thank you, Doctor.

DR. HIRSCH

Well, then, what can I do for

Scotland Yard?

SGT. McMANUS

We understand the Kessler boy

has regained consciousness.

SGT. McMANUS

Sorry.

LT. VILLIERS

Has Mr. Kessler said anything

regarding the attack on the

moors?

DR. HIRSCH

Excuse me.  Yes?

SECRETARY (V.O.)

Roger Mathison, Doctor.

DR. HIRSCH

What here?

SECRETARY (V.O.)

He's on the telephone.

DR. HIRSCH

Tell him I'm out.  No, tell

him I've passed away.  An old

war wound or something.  Tell

him I'm dead.  And no more

calls!

DR. HIRSCH

You were saying?

LT. VILLIERS

Has David Kessler anything to

say concerning the attack on

the moors?

DR. HIRSCH

Why don't we ask him?

15   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

DAVID

I'm sorry if I conflict with

your report, but Jack and I

were not attacked by a man.

LT. VILLIERS

So you've said.

SGT. McMANUS

He may have a point,

Lieutenant.  Two strong boys

would be able to defend

themselves against one man.

LT. VILLIERS

Sgt. McManus, are you

suggesting that David and Jack

were, in fact, attacked by

some animal and that the

officialdom of East Proctor

has conspired to keep it a

secret?  We have an autopsy

report on the murderer who was

shot in the act by the local

police.  We have two witnesses

to the crime.  You'll forgive

me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider

your testimony as coming from

someone who has gone through a

terrible shock.

SGT. McMANUS

Lieutenant, the boy seems

pretty lucid to me and....

LT. VILLIERS

And what, Sergeant?

SGT. McMANUS

(defeated)

I don't rightly know, sir.

LT. VILLIERS

That is precisely my point.

David, as far as we are

concerned, the matter is

closed.  We won't trouble you

any further.  Good day.

LT. VILLIERS

Doctor.

DAVID

There were witnesses?

DR. HIRSCH

So they said.

DAVID

How could there have been

witnesses?  It was so dark.

We were running and I fell and

Jack went to help me up and

this thing came from

nowhere...I don't understand

what they're talking about.

DR. HIRSCH

In time I'm sure it will all

come back to you.

DAVID

Doctor, my memory is fine.

It's my sanity I'm beginning

to worry about.

17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

MISS GALLAGHER

Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please.

DAVID

(awakened)

I was having a nightmare.

MISS GALLAGHER

Yes, well these should help

that.  That's right, drink up.

MISS GALLAGHER

Now go back to sleep so you'll

be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the

morning.

DAVID

What time is it?

MISS GALLAGHER

It's nearly eight.  I'm off

duty shortly, then I'm off to

the films with Alex.

DAVID

Alex?

MISS GALLAGHER

Miss Price, the other nurse

that attended you.

DAVID

What are you going to see?

MISS GALLAGHER

An American film about the

Mafia called `See You Next

Wednesday', and I want to see

it badly, so you give me no

problems and go to sleep.

DAVID

(dropping off)

Do you have bad dreams, too?

MISS GALLAGHER

Some, everyone does.

DAVID

Yes, but does everyone kill

Bambi?

MISS GALLAGHER

Bambi?

MISS GALLAGHER

Kill Bambi?

18   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - DAY

MRS. HOBBS

Miss Price.

ALEX

Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

MRS. HOBBS

Take these round now, will you

please?  The American boy in

twenty-one is only to have

these after he's eaten.  Will

you be sure of that?

ALEX

Has he been refusing food?

MRS. HOBBS

Nothing quite as dramatic as

that, Miss Price.  He just

doesn't eat enough of what is

put before him.  He suffers

from nightmares.  I'd think he

just needs a hand to hold.

ALEX

Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

19   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - DAY

ALEX

Hello, Benjamin.

BENJAMIN

No.

ALEX

No what?

BENJAMIN

No.

ALEX

Well, all right then, be that

way.  Here, swallow this.

BENJAMIN

No.

ALEX

Feeling better?

BENJAMIN

No.

ALEX

The doctor will be round

later.  Would you like a

picture book to look at?  We

have some lovely funny Beanos.

BENJAMIN

No.

ALEX

Right.

20   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

ALEX

Has the patient in twenty-one

gotten his tray yet?

ORDERLY

The American?  Yes, duck.

ALEX

How did he look?

ORDERLY

What do you mean, `how did he

look'?

ALEX

You know, did he seem

depressed?  Do you think he'll

eat the food?

ORDERLY

(annoyed)

I'm an orderly, not a bleeding

psychiatrist!  I push things

about, but I've little say

what happens to them.

ALEX

Thank you.

21   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

ALEX

(softly)

Mr. Kessler?

DAVID

(lifeless)

Yes?

ALEX

You haven't eaten your lunch.

DAVID

I'm not very hungry, thank

you.

ALEX

I'm afraid you have to eat

something.

DAVID

Please, really.  I'm not

hungry.

ALEX

You put me in an awkward

position, Mr. Kessler.

DAVID

How is that?

ALEX

(she shakes the paper cup)

Well, you're to take these

after you've eaten.  Now what

kind of nurse would I be if I

failed in so simple a task as

giving out some pills?

DAVID

Leave the pills.  I'll take

them later.

ALEX

Sorry.

DAVID

Aw come on, Miss Price!

ALEX

Call me Alex.

DAVID

Aw come on, Alex!

ALEX

Shall I be forced to feed you,

Mr. Kessler?

DAVID

Call me David.

ALEX

Shall I be forced to feed you,

David?

DAVID

This is absurd.  I'm not

hungry.  I don't want any

food.

ALEX

Right.

ALEX

Let's try a little harder,

shall we?

DAVID

Will you give me a break?

ALEX

Will I have to take such

drastic action again, David?

DAVID

May I have a glass of milk?

FADE OUT

22   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

God!

23   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

MRS. HOBBS

Orderly!  Miss Gallagher!

MRS. HOBBS

Orderly, go at once to twenty-

one and restrain the patient.

MRS. HOBBS

Miss Gallagher, remain here at

the desk.  I'll be in twenty-

one.

24   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

DR. HIRSCH

You've never had bad dreams

before?

DAVID

(upset)

Sure, as a kid.  But never so

real.  Never so bizarre.

DR. HIRSCH

Did you get a good look at the

man who attacked you?

DAVID

I've told you, it wasn't a

man.  It was an animal.  A big

wolf or something.  A rabid

dog.

DR. HIRSCH

(chewing on his glasses)

Yes.

DAVID

Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've

been traumatized, but Jack was

torn apart.  I saw him.  A man

can't do that to someone with

his bare hands.

DR. HIRSCH

You'd be surprised what

horrors a man is capable of.

DAVID

Did you see Jack?

DR. HIRSCH

No.  In fact, your wounds were

cleaned and dressed before you

arrived here.

DAVID

Did you talk to the police in

East Proctor?  Did the cops go

to The Slaughtered Lamb?

DR. HIRSCH

I really don't know.

DAVID

Then why the hell are you so

quick to disbelieve me?  You

yourself said it must have

taken incredible strength to

tear apart a person like that.

DR. HIRSCH

(rubs his forehead)

David, please.  The police are

satisfied.  I'm certain that

if a monster were out roaming

northern England we'd have

seen it on the telly.

DAVID

You really think I'm crazy,

don't you?

DR. HIRSCH

Believe me.  The Hound of the

Baskervilles was an invention

of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's.

And if you'd read the bloody

book, you'd find that Holmes

discovered your house of hell

a fraud, a fake.

DR. HIRSCH

Now really, David.  You're far

too intelligent to go on this

way.  When you return to

America I want you to seek out

a competent psychiatrist or

psychologist or something and

stop this nonsense.  You'll be

leaving this hospital in three

or four days, please remain

sane.  At least until you are

no longer our responsibility.

DAVID

Dr. Hirsch?

(pause)

I'd rather not be by myself.

DR. HIRSCH

Of course not, David.  I'll

fetch in young Miss Price.

DISSOLVE

25   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

DAVID

(quietly)

You're a very beautiful girl.

ALEX

(embarrassed)

I thought you were asleep.

DAVID

I was.  What are you reading?

ALEX

`A Connecticut Yankee in King

Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.

DAVID

Do you like it?

ALEX

I've just started it.  My

friend gave it to me.

ALEX

What do you dream about?

DAVID

I dream of death mostly.

ALEX

I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have

asked you.

DAVID

It's okay.  I want to talk to

you.

DAVID

How old are you?

ALEX

That's not really a very

proper question.

DAVID

How old are you?

ALEX

Twenty-eight.

DAVID

I'm twenty-seven.

ALEX

I know.

DAVID

Now what do you want to talk

about?

ALEX

Was Jack Goodman your good

friend?

DAVID

(seriously)

My best friend.  My very best

friend.

ALEX

(embarrassed)

Shall I read to you?

DAVID

What?  Oh, yes, please.

ALEX

(opens book)

A Connecticut Yankee in King

Arthur's Court by Samuel L.

Clemens.  This is after the

preface but before chapter

one: A Word of Explanation.

You all right?

DAVID

(settles back)

Yes, go on.

ALEX

(clears her throat)

Ahem, A Word of Explanation.

It was in Warwick Castle that

I came across the curious

stranger whom I am going to

talk about.  He attracted me

by three things: his candid

simplicity, his marvelous

familiarity with ancient

armor, and the restfulness of

his company - for he did all

the talking.  We fell together

as modest people will in the

tail of the herd....

Hello.  You all right?

DAVID

I'm sorry I woke you up.

ALEX

Don't be silly.  Can I get you

something?

DAVID

No, thank you.  Just keep me

company for a while.

ALEX

That's easy enough.

DAVID

I keep having these really

terrible dreams.  They are

getting worse and I can't seem

to stop them.

ALEX

David, your dreams will stop.

You'll leave England and your

bad memories; and then this

will all fade away.

DAVID

Will you come with me?

ALEX

(taken aback)

What?

DAVID

(smiling)

I'm serious.  You don't know

me and I know nothing about

you.  We have a perfect

relationship.

ALEX

Now, David, I said I would

keep you company, but I meant

right here and now.

DAVID

Will you think about it?

ALEX

How did we get from your bad

dreams to my taking a holiday

with a patient?

DAVID

(big grin)

Not just a patient -- me.

ALEX

You're being awfully forward,

aren't you?

DAVID

Forgive me, I'm trying to

cheer myself up and an affair

with a beautiful nurse seemed

like just the thing to do it.

ALEX

(smiles)

All I am to you is a sex

fantasy then?

DAVID

Now I'm embarrassed.

ALEX

Good.  I thought for a moment

I was the only embarrassed one

in the room.

Let me see here.

Ah you're up.  Good morning

and a good day to you.  We've

orange juice, and toast with

jam.  Good stuff there.  Now

eat it up and I'll be back for

finished.

DAVID

Good morning.

DAVID

(in mock English accent)

Please, sir, I want some more.

JACK (O.S.)

Can I have a piece of toast?

JACK

(pleasantly)

Nice to see you.

DAVID

(unbelieving)

Get the fuck out of here,

Jack.

JACK

Thanks a lot.

DAVID

(horrified)

This is too much.  I can't

handle this.

JACK

I'm aware that I don't look so

great, but I thought you'd be

glad to see me.

JACK

David!  You're hurting my

feelings.

DAVID

(astounded)

Hurting your feelings?  Has it

occurred to you that it may be

unsettling to have you rise

from your grave to visit me?

Listen to me, I'm talking to a

hamburger!

JACK

I'm sorry to be upsetting you,

David, but I had to come.

DAVID

(aghast)

Aren't you supposed to be

buried in New York someplace?

JACK

Yeah.  Your parents came to my

funeral.  I was surprised at

how many people came.

DAVID

(resigned)

Why should you be surprised?

You were a very well-liked

person.

JACK

Debbie Klein cried a lot.

DAVID

I can't stand it.

JACK

So you know what she does?

She's so grief stricken she

runs to find solace in Rudy

Levine's bed.

DAVID

Rudy Levine the shmuck?

JACK

Life mocks me even in death.

DAVID

(to himself)

I'm going completely crazy.

JACK

(loud)

David!

DAVID

(louder)

What?!

JACK

David, now I know this may be

hard for you, but I have to

warn you.

DAVID

(shouting)

Warn me?  Will you get out of

here, you meat loaf?

JACK

I'm a grisly sight, it's true;

but I love you and that's why

I'm here.  You've got to know.

DAVID

If you love me so much, Jack,

you'll realize how

disconcerting it is to share

one's breakfast with the

living dead!

JACK

We were attacked by a

werewolf.

DAVID

(covers his ears)

I'm not listening!

JACK

On the moors, we were attacked

by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

DAVID

Shut up, you zombie!

JACK

I was murdered, an unnatural

death, and now I walk the

earth in limbo until the

werewolf's curse is lifted.

DAVID

(incredulous, furious)

What's wrong with you?  Shut

up!

JACK

The wolf's bloodline must be

severed.  The last remaining

werewolf must be destroyed.

DAVID

Will you be quiet?!

JACK

It's you, David.

DAVID

What?!

JACK

You survived and now you shall

continue the curse.

DAVID

What are you talking about?  I

won't accept this!  Get out!

God damit!

JACK

Remember what that guy at The

Slaughtered Lamb said?

`Beware the moon.'

DAVID

(quietly)

Stop it, Jack.

JACK

Beware the moon.  The full

moon, David.  You've got two

days.

DAVID

(quietly)

Jack, please go away.  Please

go away.

JACK

You'll stalk the streets of

London a creature of the

night.

DAVID

(flares up)

You're talking like Boris

Karloff!  It's movie dialogue!

JACK

David, please believe me.  You

will kill people, David.

You've got to stop the

bloodshed before it begins.

DAVID

(yells)

Nurse!

JACK

Listen to me!  Take your own

life, David.  It's our only

chance.

DAVID

Nurse!

JACK

The supernatural!  The powers

of darkness!  It's all true.

Take your own life!  Suicide,

David.  Join me.

DAVID

(losing it)

Nurse!  Oh God!  Alex!

JACK

It's cold, David, and I'm so

alone.  The undead surround

lonely!  Kill yourself, David,

ALEX

He's not?

DR. HIRSCH

Alex, has David persisted in

his werewolf fantasies?

ALEX

Well, yes, but he seems to be

more upset by the death of his

friend.

DR. HIRSCH

Has his friend appeared to him

again?

ALEX

Yes.

DR. HIRSCH

What did he say?

ALEX

David says Jack comes to warn

him.

DR. HIRSCH

Warn him?

ALEX

Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?  Is

this more serious than I know?

DR. HIRSCH

I tried to investigate the

attack.  There are no records.

The case was closed and now

they've `misplaced' the file.

David's lacerations were

cleaned and dressed when he

arrived here and yet

supposedly no doctor examined

him before I did.  The Goodman

boy is already in the ground

so he's no good to us.  So I

went to the pub in East

Proctor where I was convinced

of two things.

ALEX

Yes.

DR. HIRSCH

They were lying.  There were

no witnesses, no escaped

lunatic.  The whole community

is hiding the truth of what

actually happened up there.

ALEX

And what else?

DR. HIRSCH

I think the village of East

Proctor is hiding some dark

and terrible secret.  I'm

convinced that, like David,

they believe in this werewolf.

DR. HIRSCH

You've absolutely no idea

where David might be?

ALEX

No.  He knows no one in

London, besides me.  I

shouldn't have left him alone.

ALEX

Surely you're not

suggesting....

DR. HIRSCH

David has suffered a severe

trauma.  I myself witnessed

some form of mass neurosis in

East Proctor.  If all the

villagers believe that Jack

Goodman was killed by a

werewolf, why shouldn't David?

And then it follows that if he

survived an attack by a

werewolf, wouldn't he himself

become a werewolf the next

full moon?

ALEX

(bewildered)

Dr. Hirsch?

DR. HIRSCH

Oh, I don't mean running about

on all fours and howling at

the moon.  But in such a

deranged state he could harm

himself, or perhaps others.

ALEX

What shall we do?

DR. HIRSCH

Let's call the police and see

if they can help us find our

wandering boy.

ALEX

David, please be rational.

Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

DAVID

Rational!?!  I'm a fucking

werewolf, for Christ's sake!

DAVID

Officer, I killed those people

last night.

BOBBIE

(interested)

You did, did you?

ALEX

He's playing a stupid joke,

sir.

DAVID

(dumbfounded)

What?

ALEX

We had an argument.  He's

being silly.

DAVID

(desperate)

I swear, I don't know this

girl.

BOBBIE

All right, you two, move

along.

DAVID

Hey, you asshole!  I want you

to arrest me!

BOBBIE

There's no call for that kind

of language.

DAVID

(shouts)

Queen Elizabeth is a man!

Prince Charles is a faggot!

Winston Churchill was full of

shit!

BOBBIE

(losing patience)

Now see here young man.

DAVID

Shakespeare was French!  The

Queen Mother sucks cocks in

hell!  Shit!  Fuck!  Piss!

BOBBIE

That's quite enough!

ALEX

(pleading)

David, please!

DAVID

Who is this girl?

BOBBIE

You're going to have to stop

this disturbance or I shall

arrest you.

DAVID

(frustrated, yelling)

That's what I want you to do,

you moron!

ALEX

(to Bobbie)

Sir, he's very upset.  His

friend was killed and....

DAVID

Will you shut up!?!!

BOBBIE

(losing his temper)

That's enough!  Now go about

your business.

ALEX

Yes, David, let's go.

DAVID

(disbelief)

You're not going to arrest me?

DAVID

Don't you think he should

arrest me?

ONLOOKER

Well, I'm not sure.  How does

he know this isn't a prank?

DAVID

(despair)

A prank?

ALEX

(urgently)

David....

BOBBIE

I've no time for this

foolishness.

(to onlookers)

Nothing to look at.  Move

along.

DAVID

Hopeless.  It's hopeless.

ALEX

(softly)

David, let's go now.

DAVID

Leave me alone, dammit!  You

people are crazy!  I've got to

get away from here!  I've got

to do something!

ALEX

(worried)

David, don't lose control.

DAVID

(approaching, hysteria)

Control!?!  What control!?!

Get away from me!

DAVID

Leave me alone!

ALEX

David, wait!

78   EXT. ALLEY - DAY

79   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

LT. VILLIERS

The forensic lads seem to feel

that some sort of animal was

involved, that's true, but I

hardly think....

DR. HIRSCH

(interrupts)

Regardless of what you think,

Lieutenant, the fact remains

that David is missing and that

we must find him.

SGT. McMANUS

Before nightfall.

DR. HIRSCH

Precisely.

LT. VILLIERS

(harried)

Gentlemen, please.  We shall

find Mr. Kessler as quickly as

we're able.

ALEX

He tried to have himself

arrested.  He....

LT. VILLIERS

(interrupts)

Getting arrested isn't all

that difficult, Miss Price.

ALEX

He wants help.  He....

DR. HIRSCH

(interrupts)

What can we do to assist you?

LT. VILLIERS

(rising)

Stay here.  If we need you,

we'll know where to reach you.

LT. VILLIERS

I cannot accept a connection

between David Kessler and last

night's murders.  We will find

him, however.  I can assure

you of that.

SGT. McMANUS

We'll find him, not to worry.

ALEX

(distraught)

What shall we do?

DR. HIRSCH

(comforting)

Tea would be nice.

80   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - DAY

DAVID

Yes, operator.  I'd like to

call the United States and

reverse the charges.  David

Kessler for anyone.  Yes, I'll

wait.  Hello?  Yes, area code

315/472-3402.  Thank you.

(pause)

Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes,

you'll accept the charges.

Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom

or Dad home?  Where are they?

Where's Max?  You're all

alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't

leave me alone when I was ten.

No, not ten and a half either.

I'm still in London.  I'm all

better.  Look, would you tell

Mom and Dad that I love them?

I don't care, Rachel, just do

it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And,

Rachel, don't fight with Max.

Well, try.  Look, kid, please

don't forget to tell Mom and

Dad I love them.  I love Max

and you, too.  Well, I do.

No, I'm not being weird, you

little creep.  You promise?

Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love

you.  Bye.

81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V.

TICKET LADY

Two and a half quid, please.

DAVID

Will you take a traveler's

check?

TICKET LADY

No, sorry.

DAVID

Keep the change.

TICKET LADY

Well, thank you, sir!

82   INT. CINEMA - DAY

DAVID

Hi, Jack.

JACK

Hi, David.

DAVID

What can I say, Jack?

JACK

You don't have to say

anything.

DAVID

Aren't you going to say, `I

told you so'?

JACK

If I was still alive, I

probably would.

DAVID

You look awful.

JACK

Thank you.

DAVID

(apologizes quickly)

I didn't mean it.  I don't

know what I'm saying.  I'm not

even sure it was me who killed

those people.  I don't

remember doing it.

JACK

What about the zoo?

DAVID

Well, even if I'm not the

wolfman, I am crazy enough to

do something like that.  I

mean, here I sit in Leicester

Square talking to a corpse.

I'm glad to see you, Jack.

JACK

I want you to meet some

people.

JACK

David Kessler, this is Gerald

Bringsly.

DAVID

Hello.

JACK

Gerald is the man you murdered

in the subway.  We thought it

best you didn't see him as

he's a fresh kill and still

pretty messy.

BRINGSLY

(in shadow; very English)

Yes, I do look most

unpleasant.

DAVID

(horrified)

Why are you doing this to me,

Jack?

BRINGSLY

This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.

He is your good friend,

whereas I am a victim of your

carnivorous lunar activities.

DAVID

(appalled)

Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry.  I

have absolutely no idea what

to say to you.

BRINGSLY

You've left my wife a widow

and my children fatherless.

And I understand that I am to

walk the earth one of the

living dead until the wolf's

bloodline is severed and the

curse lifted.

BRINGSLY

You must die, David Kessler.

JACK

David, this is Harry Berman

and his fiancee Judith Browns.

JACK

And these gentlemen are Alf,

Ted, and Joseph.

DERELICT #2

Can't say we're pleased to

meet you, Mr. Kessler.

DAVID

(defeated)

What shall I do?

JACK

Suicide.

HARRY

(adamantly)

You must take your own life!

DAVID

That's easy for you to say -

you're already dead.

BRINGSLY

No, David.  Harry and I and

everyone you murder are not

dead.  The undead.

DAVID

(to Jack)

Why are you doing this to me?

JACK

Because this must be stopped.

DAVID

How shall I do it?

JUDITH

Sleeping pills?

DERELICT #1

Not sure enough.

DAVID

I could hang myself.

JACK

If you did it wrong, it would

be painful.  You'd choke to

death.

DERELICT #3

So what?  Let `im choke.

JACK

Do you mind?  The man's a

friend of mine.

DERELICT #3

Well he ain't no friend of

mine.

BRINGSLY

Gentlemen, please.

HARRY

A gun.

DERELICT #1

I know where he can get a gun.

DAVID

Don't I need a silver bullet

or something?

JACK

Be serious, would you?

DAVID

Madness.  I've gone totally

mad.

HARRY

A gun is good.

JUDITH

You just put the gun to your

forehead and pull the trigger.

BRINGSLY

If you put it in your mouth,

then you'd be sure not to

miss.

DAVID

Thank you, you're all so

thoughtful.
