Ten Things I Hate About You - by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith

TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU

written by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith

based on 'Taming of the Shrew" by William Shakespeare

RIDER

Hey -- sorry.

KAT

Leave it

KAT (continuing)

I said, leave it!

BIANCA

Did you change your hair?

CHASTITY

No.

BIANCA

You might wanna think about it

BOY

(adoring)

Hey, Bianca.

GIRL

Awesome shoes.

MISS PERKY

I'm sure you won't find Padua any

different than your old school.  Same

little asswipe mother-fuckers

everywhere.

MISS PERKY

(continuing)

Any questions?

CAMERON

I don't think so, ma'am

MISS PERKY

Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got

deviants to see.

MISS PERKY

(continuing)

Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our

visits a weekly ritual.

PATRICK

I missed you.

MISS PERKY

It says here you exposed yourself to a

group of freshmen girls.

PATRICK

It was a bratwurst.  I was eating

lunch.

MISS PERKY

With the teeth of your zipper?

MICHAEL

You the new guy?

CAMERON

So they tell me...

MICHAEL

C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the

tour.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

So -- which Dakota you from?

CAMERON

North, actually.  How'd you   ?

MICHAEL

I was kidding. People actually live

there?

CAMERON

Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by

the cows, though.

MICHAEL

How many people were in your old

school?

CAMERON

Thirty-two.

MICHAEL

Get out!

CAMERON

How many people go here?

MICHAEL

Couple thousand. Most of them evil

MICHAEL

We've got your basic beautiful people.

Unless they talk to you first, don't

bother.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Those 're your cowboys.

CAMERON

That I'm used to.

MICHAEL

Yeah, but these guys have never seen a

horse.  They just jack off to Clint

Eastwood.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

To the right, we have the Coffee Kids.

Very edgy.  Don't make any sudden

movements around them.

MICHAEL

And these delusionals are the White

Rastae.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Big Marley fans.  Think they're black.

Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a

lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I

mean.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?

DEREK

(very stoned)

Michael, my brother, peace

CAMERON

So where do you fit in all this?

MICHAEL

Future MBAs-  We're all Ivy League,

already accepted.  Someday I'll be

sipping Merlot while those guys --

MICHAEL

(continuing)

are fixing my Saab.  Yuppie greed is

back, my friend.

CAMERON

That girl -- I --

MICHAEL

You burn, you pine, you perish?

CAMERON

Who is she?

MICHAEL

Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't

even think about it

CAMERON

Why not?

MICHAEL

I could start with your haircut, but it

doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to

date until her older sister does.  And

that's an impossibility.

MRS. BLAISE

Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that

does it for our analysis of The Old Man

and the Sea.  Any other comments?

(with dread)

Kat?

KAT

Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?

MRS. BLAISE

I'm sorry?

KAT

This book is about a guy and his

fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial

topic.

KAT

(continuing)

Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still

revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive,

alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of

cats.

JOEY

As opposed to a bitter self-righteous

hag who has no friends?

MRS. BLAISE

That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.

KAT

I guess the school board thinks because

Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's

worthy of our time

KAT

(continuing)

What about Colette?  Charlotte Bronte?

Simone de Beauvoir?

PATRICK

Mother Goose?

MISS PERKY

Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've

been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.

KAT

Expressing my opinion is not a

terrorist action.

MISS PERKY

Well, yes, compared to your other

choices of expression this year, today's

events are quite mild.  By the way,

Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation

went quite well, in case you're

interested.

KAT

I still maintain that he kicked himself

in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.

MISS PERKY

The point is Kat -- people perceive you

as somewhat ...

KAT

Tempestuous?

MISS PERKY

No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the

term used most often.

MISS PERKY

(continuing)

You might want to work on that

KAT

As always, thank you for your excellent

guidance.

TEACHER (0.S.)

I realize the language of Mr.

Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting,

but I'm sure you're all doing your best.

TEACHER (0.S.)

(continuing)

Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment

on what you've read so far?

BIANCA

Not really.

TEACHER

Mandella -- since you're assisting us,

you might as well comment.  I'm assuming

you read the assignment.

MANDELLA

Uh, yeah, I read it all

TEACHER

The whole play^

MANDELIA

The whole folio.  All the plays.

TEACHER

(disbelieving)

You've read every play by William

Shakespeare?

MANDELLA

Haven't you?

MANDELLA

KAT

The fact that you're cutting gym so you

can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear

his name, is a little without in itself

if you ask me.

MANDELLA

Who's that?

KAT

Patrick Verona   Random skid.

MANDELLA

That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone

for a year? I heard he was doing porn

movies.

KAT

I'm sure he's completely incapable of

doing anything that interesting.

MANDELLA

He always look so

KAT

Block E?

KAT

(continuing)

Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a

very slow way to die.

MANDELLA

Just a little.

KAT

What's this?

MANDELLA

An attempted slit.

KAT

I realize that the men of this fine

institution are severely lacking, but

killing yourself so you can be with

William Shakespeare is beyond the scope

of normal teenage obsessions.  You're

venturing far past daytime talk show

fodder and entering the world of those

who need very expensive therapy.

MANDELLA

But imagine the things he'd say during

sex.

KAT

Okay, say you do it.  You kill

yourself, you end up in wherever you end

up and he's there.  Do you really think

he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound

compulsive who failed volleyball?

COHORT

Virgin alert.

JOEY

Lookin' good, ladies.

MANDELLA

Tragic.

CAMERON

Why do girls like that always like guys

like that?

MICHAEL

Because they're bred to.  Their mothers

liked guys like that, and their

grandmothers before them. Their gene

pool is rarely diluted.

CAMERON

He always have that shit-eating grin?

MICHAEL

Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish

I could say he's a moron, but he's

number twelve in the class.  And a

model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's

rumored to have a big tube sock ad

coming out.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

You know French?

CAMERON

Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada

MICHAEL

Guess who just signed up for a tutor?

CAMERON

You mean I'd get a chance to talk to

her?

MICHAEL

You could consecrate with her, my

friend.

JOEY

(re her dress)

The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't

you been reading your Sassy?

KAT

Yeah, and I noticed the only part of

you featured in your big Kmart spread

was your elbow.  Tough break.

JOEY

(practically

spitting)

They're running the rest of me next

month.

KAT

The people at this school are so

incredibly foul.

MANDELLA

You could always go with me.  I'm sure

William has some friends.

JOEY

Need a ride, ladies?

MANDELLA

That's a charming new development

KAT

(yelling)

Remove head from sphincter!  Then

pedal!

CAMERON

You all right?

MICHAEL

Yeah, just a minor encounter with the

shrew.

CAMERON

That's her?  Bianca's sister?

MICHAEL

The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.

KAT

"Undulating with desire, Adrienne

removes her crimson cape, revealing her

creamy --"

WALTER

SHARON

In the microwave.

WALTER

(to Kat)

Make anyone cry today?

KAT

Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty.

KAT

(continuing)

Where've you been?

BIANCA

(eyeing Walter)

Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.

WALTER

Hello, precious.

KAT

How touching.

WALTER

What's this?  It says Sarah Lawrence?

KAT

I guess I got in

SHARON

What's a synonym for throbbing?

WALTER

Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of

the country.

KAT

I know.

WALTER

I thought we decided you were going to

school here.  At U of 0.

KAT

You decided.

BIANCA

Is there even a question that we want

her to stay?

KAT

Ask Bianca who drove her home

SHARON

Swollen...turgid.

WALTER

(to Bianca; upset)

Who drove you home?

BIANCA

Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's

this boy... and I think he might ask...

WALTER

No! You're not dating until your sister

starts dating.  End of discussion.

BIANCA

What if she never starts dating?

WALTER

Then neither will you.  And I'll get to

sleep at night.

BIANCA

But it's not fair -- she's a mutant,

Daddy!

KAT

This from someone whose diary is

devoted to favorite grooming tips?

WALTER

Enough!

WALTER

(continuing)

Do you know what this is?

(in unison, by

rote)

The sound of a fifteen-year-old in

labor.

WALTER

This is why you're not dating until

your sister does.

BIANCA

But she doesn't want to date.

WALTER

Exactly my point

WALTER

(continuing)

Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich

before you women start dilating?

SHARON

Tumescent!

WALTER

(to Sharon; as he

leaves)

You're not helping.

BIANCA

Can we make this quick?  Roxanne

Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an

incredibly horrendous public break- up

on the quad.  Again.

CAMERON

Well, I thought we'd start with

pronunciation, if that's okay with you.

CAMERON

(looking down)

Okay... then how 'bout we try out some

French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?

BIANCA

You're asking me out.  That's so cute.

What's your name again?

CAMERON

(embarrassed)

Forget it.

BIANCA

No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have

a proper introduction ---

CAMERON

Cameron.

BIANCA

The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the

mercy of a particularly hideous breed of

loser.  My sister.  I can't date until

she does.

CAMERON

Seems like she could get a date easy

enough...

BIANCA

CAMERON

Why?

BIANCA

Unsolved mystery.  She used to be

really popular when she started high

school, then it was just like she got

sick of it or something.

CAMERON

That's a shame.

BIANCA

Gosh, if only we could find Kat a

boyfriend...

CAMERON

Let me see what I can do.

MICHAEL

You're in school for one day and you

ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you

have no concept of the high school

social code?

CAMERON

I teach her French, get to know her,

dazzle her with charm and she falls in

love with me.

MICHAEL

Unlikely, but even so, she still can't

go out with you.  So what's the

point?

CAMERON

What about him?

MICHAEL

(confused)

You wanna go out with him?

CAMERON

(impatient)

No - he could wrangle with the sister.

MICHAEL

What makes you think he'll do it?

CAMERON

He seems like he thrives on danger

MICHAEL

No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard

he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just

got out of Alcatraz...

CAMERON

They always let felons sit in on Honors

Biology?

MICHAEL

I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He

sold his own liver on the black market

so he could buy new speakers.

CAMERON

Forget his reputation.  Do you think

we've got a plan or not?

MICHAEL

Did she actually say she'd go out with

you?

CAMERON

That's what I just said

MICHAEL

You know, if you do go out with Bianca,

you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone.

Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.

CAMERON

I thought you hated those people.

MICHAEL

Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients

when I get to Wall Street.

CAMERON

So now all we gotta do is talk to him.

MICHAEL

I'll let you handle that.

PEPE

Some people like the Colombian, but it

all depends on your acidity preference.

Me?  I prefer East African and

Indonesian.  You start the day with a

Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian

Sidamo in your cup, you're that much

farther ahead than someone drinkin'

Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I

mean?

CAMERON

Hey, there

CAMERON

(continuing)

Later, then.

MICHAEL

Hey.

JOEY

Are you lost?

MICHAEL

Nope - just came by to chat

JOEY

We don't chat.

MICHAEL

Well, actually, I thought I'd run an

idea by you.  You know, just to see if

you're interested.

JOEY

We're not.

MICHAEL

(grimacing)

Hear me out.  You want Bianca don't

you?

MICHAEL

(continuing)

But she can't go out with you because

her sister is this insane head case and

no one will go out with her. right?

JOEY

Does this conversation have a purpose?

MICHAEL

So what you need to do is recruit a guy

who'll go out with her.  Someone who's

up for the job.

JOEY

MICHAEL

Exactly

JOEY

MICHAEL

Oh, hey, nothin' man   Purely good will

on my part.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

I have a dick on my face, don't I?

CAMERON

You got him involved?

MICHAEL

Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when

you let the enemy think he's

orchestrating the battle, you're in a

position of power. We let him pretend

he's calling the shots, and while he's

busy setting up the plan, you have time

to woo Bianca.

CAMERON

You're one brilliant guy

MICHAEL

KAT

So he has this huge raging fit about

Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to

his male-dominated, puking frat boy,

number one golf team school. I have no

say at all.

MANDELLA

William would never have gone to a

state school.

KAT

William didn't even go to high school

MANDELLA

That's never been proven

KAT

Neither has his heterosexuality.

KAT

(continuing)

I appreciate your efforts toward a

speedy death, but I'm consuming.

(pointing at her

food)

Do you mind?

MANDELLA

Does it matter?

KAT

If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any

school you want, precious.  Don't forget

your tiara."

MANDELLA

Janice Parker told me he was a roadie

for Marilyn Manson.

KAT

Janice Parker is an idiot

MISS PERKY

(looking at chart)

I don't understand, Patrick.  You

haven't done anything asinine this week.

Are you not feeling well?

PATRICK

Touch of the flu.

MISS PERKY

I'm at a loss, then.  What should we

talk about? Your year of absence?

PATRICK

How 'bout your sex life?

MISS PERKY

Why don't we discuss your driving need

to be a hemorrhoid?

PATRICK

What's to discuss?

MISS PERKY

You weren't abused, you aren't stupid,

and as far as I can tell, you're only

slightly psychotic -- so why is it that

you're such a fuck-up?

PATRICK

Well, you know -- there's the prestige

of the job title... and the benefits

package is pretty good...

MISS PERKY

Fine.  Go do something repugnant and

give us something to talk about next

week.

MANDELLA

Look, it's really easy.

TREVOR

You're a freedom fighter. Be proud,

sister.

MANDELLA

(rotely)

It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not

related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a

political figure.  I do not live in

South Africa.  My parents just spent a

few too many acid trips thinking they

were revolutionaries.

TREVOR

But you freed our people

MANDELLA

Your "people" are white, suburban high

school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I

have not freed you, Trevor.

(grabbing his arm

dramatically)

Only you can free yourself.

BIANCA

C'esc ma tete. This is my head

CAMERON

Right.  See?  You're ready for the

quiz.

BIANCA

I don't want to know how to say that

though.  I want to know useful things.

Like where the good stores are.  How

much does champagne cost?  Stuff like

Chat.  I have never in my life had to

point out my head to someone.

CAMERON

That's because it's such a nice one.

BIANCA

Forget French.

BIANCA

(continuing)

How is our little Find the Wench A Date

plan progressing?

CAMERON

Well, there's someone I think might be

--

BIANCA

Show me

BIANCA

Give me a sign when he walks by.  And

don't point.

CAMERON

There.

BIANCA

Where?

CAMERON

I guess he didn't see me

(calling after

Patrick)

Some other time --

BIANCA

My God, he's repulsive. He's so

perfect!

PATRICK

(shrugging them

off)

What?

PATRICK

Yeah

JOEY

What do you think?

PATRICK

Two legs, nice rack...

JOEY

Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out

with her.

PATRICK

Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.

JOEY

You just said

PATRICK

You need money to take a girl out

JOEY

But you'd go out with her if you had

the cake?

PATRICK

(sarcastic)

Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had

the plane.

JOEY

You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab,

you do the honors.

PATRICK

You're gonna pay me to take out some

girl?

JOEY

I can't date her sister until that one

gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch.

She doesn't want a boyfriend.

PATRICK

How much?

JOEY

PATRICK

I can't take a girl like that out on

twenty bucks.

JOEY

Fine, thirty.

JOEY

(continuing)

Take it or leave it.  This isn't a

negotiation.

PATRICK

Fifty, and you've got your man.

MR. CHAPIN

(proudly)

Good run, Stratford.

PATRICK

Hey. Girlie.

PATRICK

(continuing)

I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?

KAT

(smiles brightly)

Sweating like a pig, actually.  And

yourself?

PATRICK

There's a way to get a guy's attention.

KAT

My mission in life.

KAT

(continuing)

Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So,

you see, it worked.  The world makes

sense again.

PATRICK

Pick you up Friday, then

KAT

Oh, right.  Friday.

PATRICK

The night I take you to places you've

never been before.  And back.

KAT

Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside?

Do you even know my name, screwboy?

PATRICK

I know a lot more than that

KAT

Doubtful.  Very doubtful.

PATRICK

(calling after her)

You're no bargain either, sweetheart.

SCURVY

So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a

new Blaupunkt.

MICHAEL

He took the bait.

BIANCA

Have you ever considered a new look? I

mean, seriously, you could have some

potential buried under all this

hostility.

KAT

I have the potential to smack the crap

out of you if you don't get out of my

way.

BIANCA

Can you at least start wearing a bra?

PATRICK

Hey

PATRICK

(continuing)

You hate me don't you?

KAT

I don't really think you warrant that

strong an emotion.

PATRICK

Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at

the track with me.

KAT

And why would I do that?

PATRICK

Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer,

you with money in your eyes, me with my

hand on your ass...

KAT

You -- covered in my vomit.

PATRICK

Seven-thirty?

PATRICK

Nice ride. Vintage fenders.

KAT

Are you following me?

PATRICK

I was in the laundromat. I saw your

car. Thought I'd say hi.

KAT

Hi

PATRICK

You're not a big talker, are you?

KAT

Depends on the topic. My fenders don't

really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

KAT

(continuing)

Hey -- do you mind?

JOEY

Not at all

JOEY

(continuing)

You fucking bitch!

WALTER

My insurance does not cover PMS

KAT

Then tell them I had a seizure.

WALTER

Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You

punishing me?

KAT

I thought you were punishing me.

WALTER

Why can't we agree on this?

KAT

Because you're making decisions for me.

WALTER

As a parent, that's my right

KAT

So what I want doesn't matter?

WALTER

You're eighteen.  You don't know what

you want.  You won't know until you're

forty-five and you don't have it.

KAT

(emphatic)

I want to go to an East Coast school! I

want you to trust me to make my own

choices.  I want --

WALTER

Christ!  I want a night to go by that

I'm not staring a contraction in the

face.

JOEY

When I shell out fifty, I expect

results.

PATRICK

I'm on it

JOEY

Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't

count as a date.

PATRICK

I got her under control. She just acts

crazed in public to keep up the image.

JOEY

Let me put it to you this way, if you

don't get any action, I don't get any

action.  So get your ass on hers by the

end of the week.

PATRICK

I just upped my price

JOEY

(turning)

What?

PATRICK

A hundred bucks a date.

JOEY

Forget it.

PATRICK

Forget her sister, then.

JOEY

You better hope you're as smooth as you

think you are, Verona.

CAMERON

La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance?

BIANCA

A "copine" is someone you can count on.

An "ami" is someone who makes promises

he can't keep.

CAMERON

You got something on your mind?

BIANCA

I counted on you to help my cause. You

and that thug are obviously failing.

Aren't we ever going on our date?

CAMERON

You have my word.  As a gentleman

BIANCA

You're sweet.

CAMERON

(appreciative)

How do you get your hair to look like

that?

BIANCA

Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days.

And I never, ever use a blowdryer

without the diffuser attachment.

CAMERON

You know, I read an article about that.

BIANCA

You did?

PATRICK

(without turning

around)

Say it

MICHAEL

(clearing his

throat)

What?

PATRICK

Whatever the hell it is you're standin'

there waitin' to say.

CAMERON

We wanted to talk to you about the

plan.

PATRICK

What plan?

MICHAEL

The situation is, my man Cameron here

has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.

PATRICK

What is it with this chick?  She have

three tits?

MICHAEL

I think I speak correctly when I say

that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than

say -- Joey Dorsey's.

PATRICK

Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm

just in this for the cash.

MICHAEL

That's where we can help you.  With

Kat.

PATRICK

So Dorsey can get the girl?

MICHAEL

Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the

big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set

this whole thing up so Cameron can get

the girl.

PATRICK

You two are gonna help me tame the wild

beast?

MICHAEL

(grinning)

We're your guys.

CAMERON

And he means that strictly in a non-

prison-movie type of way.

PATRICK

Yeah -- we'll see.

MICHAEL

We're in.

CAMERON

This is it.  A golden opportunity.

Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.

MICHAEL

In that case, we'll need to make it a

school-wide blow out.

CAMERON

Will Bogey get bent?

MICHAEL

Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself

with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.

JOEY

Which do you like better?

BIANCA

I think I like the white shirt

JOEY

It's more

BIANCA

Expensive?

JOEY

Exactly

(beat)

So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's

thing on Saturday?

BIANCA

Hopefully.

JOEY

Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if

you won't be there.

BIANCA

Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's

party?

CAMERON

Sure have.

BIANCA

(pouting)

I really, really, really wanna go, but

I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.

CAMERON

I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem

to be goin' for him.

CAMERON

(continuing)

She's not a...

BIANCA

Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of

Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm

pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex

tendencies.

CAMERON

So that's the kind of guy she likes?

Pretty ones?

BIANCA

Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say

is that she'd dip before dating a guy

that smokes.

CAMERON

All right.  What else is she partial

to?

PATRICK

Lou, it's okay.  They're with me.

PATRICK

(continuing)

What've you got for me?

CAMERON

I've retrieved certain pieces of

information on Miss Katarina Stratford I

think you'll find helpful.

MICHAEL

(to Patrick)

PATRICK

What?!

MICHAEL

Good enough.

CAMERON

Number one.  She hates smokers

MICHAEL

It's a lung cancer issue

CAMERON

Her favorite uncle

MICHAEL

Dead at forty-one.

PATRICK

Are you telling me I'm a -

(spits the word

out)

"non-smoker"?

MICHAEL

Just for now.

CAMERON

Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat

likes -- pretty guys.

PATRICK

What?  You don't think I'm pretty?

MICHAEL

He's pretty!

CAMERON

Okay!  I wasn't sure

CAMERON

(continuing)

Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist

prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of

the indie-rock persuasion".

PATRICK

So what does that give me?  I'm

supposed to buy her some noodles and a

book and sit around listening to chicks

who can't play their instruments?

MICHAEL

Ever been to Club Skunk?

PATRICK

Yeah.

CAMERON

Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow

night.

PATRICK

Don't make me do it, man

MICHAEL

Assail your ears for one night.

CAMERON

It's her favorite band.

MICHAEL

I also retrieved a list of her most

PATRICK

(smiling)

Michael -- did you get this information

"illegally"?

MICHAEL

I prefer to think of it simply as an

alternative to what the law allows.

PATRICK

I'm likin' you guys better

PATRICK

(continuing)

This is really music?

BIANCA

Can you turn down the Screaming

Menstrual Bitches?  I'm trying to study.

BIANCA

(continuing)

Don't tell me you're actually going

out?  On a school night, no less.

BIANCA

(continuing;

excited)

Oh my God, does this mean you're

becoming normal?

KAT

It means that Gigglepuss is playing at

Club Skunk and we're going.

BIANCA

(disappointed)

Oh, I thought you might have a date

(beat)

I don't know why I'm bothering to ask,

but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's

party Saturday night?

KAT

What do you think?

BIANCA

I think you're a freak.  I think you do

this to torture me.  And I think you

suck.

KAT

Let's hit it.

MANDELLA

(whispering to Kat)

You think this'll work?

KAT

No fear.

KAT

(continuing)

Hello!  We'd like two for Gigglepuss!

BRUCE

I can count.

MANDELLA

I'll bet you can..

BRUCE

Go ahead.

(to Mandella)

And you

MANDELLA

(all come hither)

Yes?

BRUCE

Take it easy on the guys in there.

BRUCE

Next time, leave the Bic at home,

Skippy.

SKIPPY

It's a bottle opener.

BRUCE

Verona, my man.

PATRICK

Always a pleasure, Brucie.

BRUCE

Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss

fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen

belly-button ring for you?

PATRICK

Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of

minors come in?

BRUCE

Never

PATRICK

Padua girls.  One tall, decent body.

The other one kinda short and

undersexed?

BRUCE

Just sent 'em through.

BRUCE

(continuing)

Hey -- what happened to that chick you

brought last time?  The one with the

snake?

LEAD SINGER

Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and

we're from Olympia.

BOY (0.S.)

Pet my kitty!

LEAD SINGER

Meow

KAT

(shouting)

I need agua!

KAT

(continuing to

herself)

Shit

(shouting)

What can I get you?

KAT

Two waters.

KAT

(continuing)

You're not fooling anyone.

PATRICK

(yelling)

hey.  Great show, huh?

KAT

(yelling)

PATRICK

(yelling)

Excuse me?

KAT

(yelling)

That's what you want, isn't it?

PATRICK

(yelling; gesturing

toward the band)

Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it

for me.

KAT

(yelling)

You're not surrounded by your usual

cloud of smoke.

PATRICK

I know.  I quit.

KAT

Oh, really?

PATRICK

You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill

or The Raincoats, but they're right up

there.

KAT

You know who The Raincoats are?

PATRICK

Why, don't you?

PATRICK

(continuing)

I watched you out there   I've never

seen you look like that

PATRICK

(continuing)

Come to that party with me.

KAT

(yelling)

What?

(to Kat, yelling)

You forgot to pay!

PATRICK

(yelling)

I got it, Rick.

PATRICK

(continuing;

yelling)

Nine-thirty then.

MANDELLA

What'd he say?

KAT

Who cares?

MANDELLA

Has he importun'd you with love in

honourable fashion?

MANDELLA

(continuing; off

her look)

Don't be Cruella with me.  I'm in favor

of romance.  You're the one that wants

to march on Washington every five

minutes.

KAT

Gigglepuss was so beyond.

MANDELLA

They were.  I only wish William could

have been here to witness the rebirth of

punk rock with us.

KAT

So true.

CAMERON

So, then she says that she almost

didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that

dress because she thought she was

mixing, you know, genres. And the fact

that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here -

"really meant something."

MICHAEL

You told me that part already.

CAMERON

Hell, I've just been going over the

whole thing in my head and -

JOEY

Hey.  Dingo Boingo

JOEY

(continuing; to

Michael)

I hear you're helpin' Verona.

MICHAEL

Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*

JOEY

You and Verona?

MICHAEL

What?  We took bathes together when we

were kids.

JOEY

What's your gig in all this?

CAMERON

I'm just the new guy.

JOEY

You better not fuck this up.  I'm

heavily invested.

MICHAEL

Hey -- it's all for the higher good

right?

CAMERON

Is it about me?

MISS PERKY

You're completely demented.

PATRICK

(cheery)

See you next week!

PATRICK/KAT

Yeah/No.

MISS PERKY

(to Patrick)

Dear God, stay away from her.  If you

two ever decided to breed, evil would

truly walk the earth.

BIANCA

She's obviously not going.

BIANCA

Daddy, I --

WALTER

And where're you going?

BIANCA

If you must know, we were attempting to

go to a small study group of friends.

WALTER

Otherwise known as an orgy?

BIANCA

It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew

you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria

Steinem" over there isn't going --

WALTER

Do you know about any party? Katarina?

BIANCA

Daddy, people expect me to be there!

WALTER

If Kat's not going, you're not going.

BIANCA

You're ruining my life'  Because you

won't be normal, I can't be normal.

KAT

What's normal?

BIANCA

Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but

you're too busy listening to Bitches Who

Need Prozac to know that.

WALTER

What's a Bogey Lowenstein?

BIANCA

Can't you forget for just one night

that you're completely wretched?

KAT

At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked

hedge-pig.

BIANCA

Like I'm supposed to know what that

even means.

KAT

It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard

of him?

BIANCA

Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's

boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not

allowed to go out, I should obsess over

a dead guy, too.

WALTER

Girls

KAT

I know about the goddamn party.  I'm

going.

WALTER

Oh, God.  It's starting.

BIANCA

It's just a party. Daddy.

WALTER

Wear the belly before you go.

BIANCA

Daddy, no!

WALTER

Just for a minute

WALTER

(continuing)

I want you to realize the weight of

your decisions.

BIANCA

You are so completely unbalanced.

KAT

Can we go now?

WALTER

(to Bianca)

Promise me you won't talk to any boys

unless your sister is present.

BIANCA

Why?

WALTER

Because she'll scare them away.

PATRICK

Nine-thirty right?

PATRICK

(continuing)

I'm early.

KAT

I'm driving.

PATRICK

Who knocked up your sister?

BOGEY

Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the

right, shots in the kitchen.

JOEY

Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat

KAT

Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline

just recede?

JOEY

Where ya goin?

KAT

Away.

JOEY

Your sister here?

KAT

Leave my sister alone.

JOEY

(smirking)

And why would I do that?

JOCK

A fight!

COFFEE KID #1

That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you

Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.

JOEY

Just who I was looking for.

KAT

BIANCA

PATRICK

What's this?

KAT

(mocking)

"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that

what you're supposed to do at a party?

PATRICK

I say, do what you wanna do.

KAT

Funny, you're the only one

MICHAEL

(high-fiving a

jock)

Moose, my man!

(to Cameron)

Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters

have already started calling.

MICHAEL

(continuing;

grabbing his belt)

Yo, Clem.

(to Cameron)

A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new

Leanne Rimes.

(with a Jamaican

swagger)

Ziggy, peace, bra.

(to Cameron)

Prefers a water pipe, but has been

known to use a bong.

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Follow the love, man

BIANCA

Where did he go?  He was just here.

CHASTITY

Who?

BIANCA

Joey.

CAMERON

Evening, ladies.

BIANCA

Hi.

CAMERON

Looks like things worked out tonight,

huh?

BIANCA

You know Chastity?

CAMERON

I believe we share an art instructor

CHASTITY

Great

BIANCA

Would you mind getting me a drink,

Cameron?

CAMERON

Certainly

Pabst?  Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?

BIANCA

Surprise me.

MICHAEL

Extremely unfortunate maneuver.

CAMERON

The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy

just picks up a girl and carries her

away while you're talking to her?

MICHAEL

Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're

making progress.

CAMERON

No, I ' m not.

CAMERON

(continuing)

She used me!  She wants to go out with

Dorsey.  Not me.  I'm an idiot!

MICHAEL

At least you're self-aware

JOEY

So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog

thing going -- and the tube sock gig "

that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up

for an ad for Queen Harry next week.

BIANCA

Queen Harry?

JOEY

It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be,

like, wearing a uniform and stuff.

BIANCA

Neat...

JOEY

My agent says I've got a good shot at

being the Prada guy next year.

BIANCA

I'll be right back.

BIANCA

He practically proposed when he found

out we had the same dermatologist. I

mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all,

but he's not exactly relevant party

conversation.

CHASTITY

Is he oily or dry?

BIANCA

Combination.  I don't know -- I thought

he'd be different.  More of a

gentleman...

CHASTITY

Bianca, I don't think the highlights of

dating Joey Dorsey are going to include

door-opening and coat-holding.

BIANCA

Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're

supposed to want to go out with are the

ones we actually want to go out with,

you know?

CHASTITY

All I know is -- I'd give up my private

line to go out with a guy like Joey.

KAT

Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need

to tell you --

BIANCA

(cutting her off)

I really don't think I need any social

advice from you right now.

PATRICK

KAT

I want another one

JOEY

My man

PATRICK

(annoyed)

It's about time.

JOEY

A deal's a deal.

JOEY

(continuing)

How'd you do it?

PATRICK

Do what?

JOEY

Get her to act like a human

PATRICK

Okay?

KAT

I'm fine. I'm

PATRICK

You're not okay.

KAT

I just need to lie down for awhile

PATRICK

Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to

sleep

KAT

I know, just let me sleep

PATRICK

What if you have a concussion? My dog

went to sleep with a concussion and woke

up a vegetable. Not that I could tell

the difference...

KAT

Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake,

okay?

PATRICK

C'mon, let's walk

PATRICK

Cameron, I'm a little busy

CAMERON

It's off. The whole thing.

PATRICK

What 're you talking about?

CAMERON

She's partial to Joey, not me

PATRICK

Cameron -- do you like the girl?

CAMERON

Sure

PATRICK

(impatient)

Then, go get her

KAT

This is so patronizing.

PATRICK

Leave it to you to use big words when

you're shitfaced.

KAT

Why 're you doing this?

PATRICK

I told you

KAT

You don't care if I die

PATRICK

Sure, I do

KAT

Why?

PATRICK

Because then I'd have to start taking

out girls who like me.

KAT

Like you could find one

PATRICK

See that?  Who needs affection when

I've got blind hatred?

KAT

Just let me sit down.

PATRICK

How's that?

PATRICK

(continuing)

Jesus.  You're like a weeble

PATRICK

(continuing)

Why'd you let him get to you?

KAT

Who?

PATRICK

Dorsey.

KAT

I hate him.

PATRICK

I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big

deal to get you to mainline tequila. You

don't seem like the type.

KAT

(holding up a

drunken head)

Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can

be "cool"?  You don't think I can be

"laid back" like everyone else?

PATRICK

(slightly

sarcastic)

I thought you were above all that

KAT

You know what they say

PATRICK

No. What do they say?

PATRICK

(continuing)

Shit!

PATRICK

(continuing)

Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up

damn it!

PATRICK

(continuing)

Kat! Wake up!

KAT

(waking)

What?

PATRICK

I thought you were...

KAT

Go away

BIANCA

Dinner taste better on the way out?

BIANCA

(continuing)

I don't get you.  You act like you're

too good for any of this, and then you

go totally apeshit when you get here.

KAT

You're welcome.

PATRICK

Cute

JOEY

A bunch of us are going to Jaret's

house.  Wanna come?

BIANCA

I have to be home in twenty minutes.

CHASTITY

(eagerly, to Joey)

I don't have to be home 'til two.

JOEY

Then, c'mon.

(to Bianca)

Maybe next time --

CAMERON

(slightly

accusatory)

Have fun tonight?

BIANCA

Tons

BIANCA

(continuing)

Cameron?

BIANCA

(continuing)

Do you think you could give me a ride

home?

PATRICK

I'm driving, so I get to pick the

tunes.

KAT

It's my car.

PATRICK

And I'm in control of it.

KAT

But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like

them.  I saw you there.

KAT

(continuing)

When you were gone last year -- where

were you?

PATRICK

Busy

KAT

Were you in jail?

PATRICK

Maybe.

KAT

No, you weren't

PATRICK

Then why'd you ask?

KAT

Why'd you lie?

KAT

(continuing)

I should do this.

PATRICK

Do what?

KAT

This.

PATRICK

Start a band?

KAT

(sarcastically)

My father wouldn't approve of that that

PATRICK

You don't strike me as the type that

would ask permission.

KAT

Oh, so now you think you know me?

PATRICK

I'm gettin' there

KAT

The only thing people know about me is

that I'm "scary".

PATRICK

PATRICK

(continuing)

So what ' s up with your dad?  He a

pain in the ass?

KAT

He just wants me to be someone I'm not.

PATRICK

Who?

KAT

BIANCA

PATRICK

No offense, but you're sister is

without.  I know everyone likes her and

all, but ...

KAT

You know -- you're not as vile as I

thought you were.

PATRICK

So, I'll see you in school

CAMERON

I looked for you back at the party, but

you always seemed to be "occupied".

BIANCA

(faux-innocence )

I was?

CAMERON

You never wanted to go out with 'me,

did you?

BIANCA

(reluctant)

Well, no...

CAMERON

Then that's all you had to say.

BIANCA

But

CAMERON

You always been this selfish?

CAMERON

Just because you're beautiful, doesn't

mean you can treat people like they

don't matter.

CAMERON

(continuing)

And I'm back in the saddle.

DEREK

Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of

my heart.

CLEM

Yippe kai-aye, bra.

(to Kat)

Dance for me, cowgirl.

CLEM

(continuing)

Okay, now tell me again why he didn't

shoot the deputy?

DEREK

Because the deputy meant him no harm,

my friend.  It was only the sheriff that

was the oppressor.

JOEY

Kat, babe, you were on fire.

MRS. BLAISE

Well now, did everyone have a good

weekend?

JOEY

Maybe we should ask Verona

MRS. BLAISE

Okay then.  Well.

(beat)

Oh, yes

MRS. BLAISE

(continuing)

I'd like you all to write your own

version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141.

MRS. BLAISE

(continuing)

Any form you'd like.  Rhyme, no rhyme,

whatever.  I'd like to see you elaborate

on his theme, however. Let's read it

aloud, shall we? Anyone?

MRS. BLAISE

(continuing)

Derek?

DEREK

(reading; in his

Rasta stoner drawl)

In faith, I do not love thee with mine

eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors

note/ But 'tis my heart that loves what

they despise/ Who in despite of view is

pleas 'd to dote.

CLEM

Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom

pass?  Damn if Shakespeare don't act as

a laxative on my person.

MANDELLA

You went to the party?  I thought we

were officially opposed to suburban

social activity.

KAT

I didn't have a choice.

MANDELLA

You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat

and what have you done with her?

KAT

I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.

MANDELLA

You didn't

KAT

I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected.

It was big fun.

PATRICK

Hey

MICHAEL

So you got cozy with she who stings?

PATRICK

No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that

I'm about to lose.

CAMERON

What'd you do to her?

PATRICK

I don ' t know.

(beat)

I decided not to nail her when she was

too drunk to remember it.

CAMERON

PATRICK

CAMERON

MICHAEL

I'm on it

MICHAEL

Hey there.  Tired of breathing?

MANDELLA

(shyly, as she

loosens the scarf)

Hi.

MICHAEL

Cool pictures.  You a fan?

MANDELLA

Yeah.  I guess.

MANDELLA

You think?

MICHAEL

Oh yeah.

MANDELLA

Who could refrain that had a heart to

love and in that heart, courage to make

' B love known?

MICHAEL

Macbeth, right?

MANDELLA

(happily stunned)

Right.

MICHAEL

Kat a fan, too?

MANDELLA

(puzzled)

Yeah...

MICHAEL

So, listen... I have this friend

CAMERON

She hates you with the fire of a

thousand suns .  That's a direct quote

PATRICK

She just needs time to cool off I'll

give it a day.

PATRICK

(continuing)

Maybe two.

PATRICK

(continuing)

You makin' any headway?

CAMERON

She kissed me.

PATRICK

(eyebrow raised)

Where?

JOEY

Don't talk to me about the sweetest

date.  That little halo Bianca is gonna

be prone and proven on prom night.  Six

virgins in a row.

PATRICK

I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the

flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --

JOEY

Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I

know.

JOEY

(continuing)

Take it

KAT

Can you even imagine?  Who the hell

would go to this a bastion of commercial

excess?

MANDELLA

Well, I guess we're not, since we don't

have dates .

KAT

Listen to you!  You sound like Betty,

all pissed off because Archie is taking

Veronica.

MANDELLA

Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like

I have a dress anyway

KAT

You ' re looking at this from the wrong

perspective.  We're making a statement.

MANDELLA

(unconvinced)

Oh, good.  Something new and different

for us.

JOEY

Hey, sweet cheeks.

BIANCA

(not looking at

him)

Hi, Joey.

JOEY

You're concentrating awfully hard

considering it's gym class.

JOEY

(continuing)

Listen, I want to talk to you about the

prom.

BIANCA

You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat

doesn't go --

JOEY

Your sister is going.

BIANCA

Since when?

JOEY

I'm taking care of it.

PATRICK

Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine

Mystique?  I lost my copy.

KAT

(frowning)

What are you doing here?

PATRICK

I heard there was a poetry reading.

KAT

You 're so --

PATRICK

Pleasant?

PATRICK

(continuing)

Wholesome.

KAT

Unwelcome.

PATRICK

Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has

her panties in a twist.

KAT

Don't for one minute think that you had

any effect whatsoever on my panties.

PATRICK

So what did I have an effect on ?

KAT

Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.

PATRICK

You were right. She's still pissed.

MICHAEL

Sweet love, renew thy force!

PATRICK

Man -- don't say shit like that to  me.

People can hear you.

CAMERON

(exasperated)

You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice

yourself on the altar of dignity and

even the score.

MICHAEL

Best case scenario, you're back on the

payroll for awhile.

PATRICK

What's the worst?

CAMERON

You get the girl.

PATRICK

If I go down. I'm takin' her with me

PATRICK

(0. S.)

"This morning, I woke up with this

feeling, I didn't know how to deal with,

and so I just decided to myself--"

PATRICK

"I'd hide it to myself.  And never talk

about it.  And didn't I go and shout it

when you walked into the room --"

PATRICK

(continuing)

" I think I love you I "

MISCREANT

Nice song, Verona.

PATRICK

Flog me.

KAT (0. S.)

Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?

KAT

Sir, I'd like to state for the record

that Mr. Verona ' s current

incarceration is unnecessary.  I never

filed a complaint.

MR. CHAPIN

You didn't have to.  He disrupted a

classroom.

KAT

But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a

simple serenade warrants a week of

detention.  There are far more hideous

acts than off-key singing being

performed by the student body on a

regular basis.

MR. CHAPIN

You're not gonna change my mind, Kat.

Rules stick.

KAT

Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There's something

I've always wanted to show you.

MR. CHAPIN

What?

KAT

These.

MR. CHAPIN

I'm going to let that slide, Katarina.

But if I catch you doing that again,

you'll be in here with the rest of these

guys.

KAT

Thank you, Mr. Chapin.

KAT

He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he

cruised on me.

PATRICK

(0. S.)

Look up, sunshine

PATRICK

I guess I never told you I'm afraid of

heights.

KAT

(smiling)

C'mon.  It's not that bad

PATRICK

Try lookin' at it from this angle

KAT

Put your right foot there --

PATRICK

Forget it.  I'm stayin'.

KAT

You want me to climb up and show you

how to get down?

PATRICK

(voice trembling)

Maybe.

KAT

You shit!

KAT

The Partridge Family?

PATRICK

I figured it had to be something

ridiculous to win your respect.  And

piss you off.

KAT

Good call.

PATRICK

So how'd you get Chapin to look the

other way?

KAT

I dazzled him with my wit

PATRICK

(sarcastic)

A soft side? Who knew?

KAT

Yeah, well, don't let it get out

PATRICK

So what's your excuse?

KAT

Acting the way we do.

PATRICK

Yes

KAT

I don't like to do what people expect.

Then they expect it all the time and

they get disappointed when you change.

PATRICK

So if you disappoint them from the

start, you're covered?

KAT

Something like that

PATRICK

Then you screwed up

KAT

How?

PATRICK

You never disappointed me.

PATRICK

(continuing)

You up for it?

KAT

For. . . ?

KAT

(continuing)

Damn it!

KID

Look, Mom

KAT

State trooper?

PATRICK

Fallacy.

KAT

The duck?

PATRICK

Hearsay.

KAT

I know the porn career's a lie.

PATRICK

Do you?

KAT

Tell me something true.

PATRICK

I hate peas.

KAT

No -- something real.  Something no one

else knows.

PATRICK

(in-between kisses)

You're sweet.  And sexy.  And

completely hot for me.

KAT

What?

PATRICK

No one else knows

KAT

You're amazingly self-assured. Has

anyone ever told you that?

PATRICK

Go to the prom with me

KAT

Is that a request or a command?

PATRICK

You know what I mean

KAT

No.

PATRICK

No what?

KAT

No, I won't go with you

PATRICK

Why not?

KAT

Because I don't want to. It's a stupid

tradition.

PATRICK

People won't expect you to go...

KAT

Why are you doing this?

KAT

All of it -- what's in it for you?

KAT

(continuing)

Create a little drama?  Start a new

rumor?  What?

PATRICK

So I have to have a motive to be with

you?

KAT

You tell me.

PATRICK

You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told

you that?

KAT

(quietly)

Answer the question, Patrick

PATRICK

(angry)

Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me.

Just the pleasure of your company.

PATRICK

cover that up

BIANCA

Quick question -- are you going to the

prom?

BIANCA

Then Guillermo says, "If you go any

lighter, you're gonna look like an extra

on 90210."

CAMERON

No...

BIANCA

do you listen to this crap?

CAMERON

What crap?

BIANCA

Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm

like, boring myself.

CAMERON

Thank God!  If I had to hear one more

story about your coiffure...

CAMERON

(continuing)

I figured you'd get to the good stuff

eventually.

BIANCA

What good stuff?

CAMERON

The "real you".

BIANCA

Like my fear of wearing pastels?

BIANCA

(continuing)

I'm kidding.

(beat)

You know how sometimes you just become

this "persona"?  And you don't know how

to quit?

CAMERON

(matter of fact)

No

BIANCA

Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how

to lie.

TREVOR

You're gonna look splendiferous in

that, Mandella.

TREVOR

(continuing)

that's cool to say.

MANDELLA

SHARON

Would you rather be ravished by a

pirate or a British rear admiral?

WALTER

Pirate -- no question.

BIANCA

Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with

you. It's tomorrow night --

WALTER

The prom?  Kat has a date?

BIANCA

No, but

WALTER

It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s

who you want me to bend my rules for?

BIANCA

He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that

is.

WALTER

You're not going unless your sister

goes.  End of story.

BIANCA

Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my

own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a

possession!

WALTER

(calling out)

You know what happens at proms?

SHARON

They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll

come home.  Let her go.

WALTER

Kissing?  Is that what you think

happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up

to my elbows in placenta all day.

KAT

(kindly)

Listen, I know you hate having to sit

home because I'm not Susie High School.

BIANCA

Like you care.

KAT

I do care. But I'm a firm believer in

doing something for your own reasons,

not someone else ' s .

BIANCA

I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only

sophomore that got asked to the prom and

I can't go, because you won ' t.

KAT

Joey never told you we went out, did

he?

BIANCA

What?

KAT

In 9th.  For a month

BIANCA

(confused)

Why?

KAT

(self-mocking)

He was, like, a total babe

BIANCA

But you hate Joey

KAT

Now I do.  Back then, was a different

story.

BIANCA

As in...

KAT

He said everyone was doing it.  So I

did it.

BIANCA

You did what?

KAT

(continuing on)

Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I

didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready.

He got pissed.  Then he broke up with

me.

BIANCA

But

KAT

After that, I swore I'd never do

anything just because "everyone else"

was doing it.  And I haven't since.

Except for Bogey's party, and my

stunning gastro-intestinal display --

BIANCA

(stunned)

Why didn't you tell me?

KAT

I wanted to let you make up your own

mind about him.

BIANCA

No. you didn't!  If you really thought

I could make my own decisions, you

would've let me go out with him instead

of helping Daddy hold me hostage.

KAT

That's not

BIANCA

I'm not stupid enough to repeat your

mistakes.

KAT

I guess I thought I was protecting you.

BIANCA

God, you're just like him! Just keep me

locked away in the dark, so I can't

experience anything for myself

KAT

Not all experiences are good, Bianca.

You can't always trust the people you

want to.

BIANCA

I guess I'll never know, will I?

BIANCA

Come in.

KAT

Feel like shopping?

WALTER

What do you wanna watch?  We've got

crap, crap, crap or crap

SHARON

Dr. Ruth?

BIANCA

Hi, Mommy.

(looking away)

WALTER

SHARON

Honey, you look beautiful!

BIANCA

You like?  My date should be here in

five.

WALTER

I'm missing something.

BIANCA

I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a

captain of oppression like some men we

know.

CAMERON

Wow

BIANCA

Let's go.

SHARON

(to Bianca)

Have a great time, honey!

WALTER

But -- who -- what --?

KAT

Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See

you in a few.

WALTER

What just happened?

SHARON

Your daughters went to the prom.

WALTER

Did I have anything to say about it?

SHARON

Absolutely not.

WALTER

That ' s what I thought

JOEY

I'm here to pick up Bianca.

WALTER

late

KAT

How'd you get a tux at the last minute?

PATRICK

It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted.

Where'd you get the dress?

KAT

It's just something I had.  You know

PATRICK

(smiling)

Oh huh

KAT

Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I

questioned your motives.  I was wrong.

PATRICK

No prob.

KAT

are you ready?

KAT

(continuing)

C'mon.  Let's get this over with.

KAT

Quite the ostentatious display

PATRICK

Look, Clem even wore his good boots

MANDELLA

Have you seen him?

KAT

Who?

MANDELLA

William - he asked me to meet him here.

KAT

Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't'

progressed to full-on hallucinations.

MICHAEL

Mi' lady.

(to Patrick)

Good sir.

BIANCA

(surprised)

What are you doing here?

CHASTITY

You think you ' re the only sophomore

at the prom?

BIANCA

I did.

CHASTITY

And just so you know, my date isn't

planning on spending most of the night

in his backseat.

CHASTITY

Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - -

your cherry. He practically made a

public announcement.

CHASTITY

(continuing)

I wanted to tell you

PATRICK

My grandmother's .

KAT

What?

PATRICK

That's where I was last year.  She'd

never lived alone -- my grandfather died

-- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail,

I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've

never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent

a year sitting next to my grandma on the

couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of

story.

KAT

That ' s completely adorable!

PATRICK

It gets worse -- you still have your

freshman yearbook?

JOEY

What's Bianca doing here with that

cheese dick?  I didn't pay you to let

some little punk ass snake me.

MICHAEL

(to Cameron)

Feces hitting fan.  C'mon

MICHAEL

(continuing)

Joey, pal, compadre.  Let's take it

easy.

CAMERON

Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man.

DEREK

Very uncool, my brother

JOEY

I'm not your brother, white boy.

JOEY

(continuing)

Just so you know -- she'll only spread

her legs once.

BIANCA

That's for making my date bleed

BIANCA

(continuing)

That's for my sister.

BIANCA

(continuing)

And that's for me.

COWBOY

And that's for the fourth grade,

asshole.

PATRICK

Wait I...

KAT

You were paid to take me out!  By --

the one person I truly hate.  I knew it

was a set-up!

PATRICK

It wasn't like that.

KAT

Really?  What was it like?  A down

payment now, then a bonus for sleeping

with me?

PATRICK

I didn't care about the money.

PATRICK

(continuing)

I cared about --

KAT

You are so not what I thought you were.

BIANCA

Are you sure you don't want to come

with us?  It'll be fun.

KAT

I ' m sure .

BIANCA

You looked beautiful last night, you

know.

KAT

So did you

CAMERON

She okay?

BIANCA

I hope so.

WALTER

Was that your sister?

KAT

Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big

ones.  Full of sperm.

WALTER

Funny.

WALTER

(continuing)

I don't understand the allure of

dehydrated food.  Is this something I

should be hip to?

KAT

No, Daddy.

WALTER

(dreading the

answer)

So tell me about this dance. Was it

fun?

KAT

Parts of it.

WALTER

Which parts?

KAT

The part where Bianca beat the hell out

of some guy.

WALTER

Bianca did what?

KAT

What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed

off on her?

WALTER

No -- impressed.

WALTER

(continuing)

You know, fathers don't like to admit

that their daughters are capable of

running their own lives.  It means we've

become spectators.  Bianca still lets me

play a few innings.  You've had me on

the bleachers for years.  When you go to

Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to

watch the game.

KAT

(hopeful)

When I go?

WALTER

Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've

changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a

check.

CAMERON (0. S.)

Katarina?

CAMERON

I'd like to express my apologies.

KAT

For what?

CAMERON

(looking down)

I didn't mean for you to get -- When

Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend,

I had no idea it would turn out so --

ugly. I would never have  done anything

to compromise your - - -

TEACHER

Who can tell me at what point Lucentio

admits his deception?

KAT

(to the teacher)

Family emergency.

BIANCA

Let go!

KAT

You set me up.

BIANCA

I just wanted --

KAT

What? To completely damage me?  To send

me to therapy forever? What?

BIANCA

No! I just wanted

MISS PERKY

Ladies?  Shall we take a trip to my

office?

MISS PERKY

So you're the real bitch

BIANCA

Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I'm the real bitch.

I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I

could.  Apparently, this makes me a

horrible person.  I'm sorry.

BIANCA

(continuing)

I swear -- I didn't know about the

money.  I didn't even know Joey was

involved.  I would never intentionally

hurt you, Kat.

MISS PERKY

(to Kat)

Do you care to respond?

KAT

Am I supposed to feel better? Like,

right now?  Or do I have some time to

think about it?

MISS PERKY

Just smack her now.

BIANCA

(to Miss Perky)

We'll be getting back to you.

MISS PERKY

What, no hug?

BIANCA

Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or

is it just me?

KAT

It's just you.

MRS. BLAISE

All right.  I'm assuming everyone found

time to compose, their poems. Except for

Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU.

MRS. BLAISE

(continuing)

Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?

KAT

I'11 go

MRS. BLAISE

Oh, Lord.

MRS. BLAISE

(continuing)

Please proceed.

KAT

I hate the way you talk to me/ and the

way you cut your hair/ I hate the way

you drive my car/ I hate it when you

stare.

KAT

(continuing)

I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and

the way you read my mind/ I hate you so

much it makes me sick/ it even makes me

rhyme.

KAT

(continuing)

I hate the way you're always right/ I

hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you

make me laugh/ even worse when you make

me cry/ I hate it that you're not

around/ and the fact that you didn't

call/ But mostly I hate the way I don '

t hate you/ not even close, not even a

little bit, not even any at all.

KAT

A Fender Strat. You bought this?

PATRICK

I thought you could use it. When you

start your band.

PATRICK

(continuing)

Besides, I had some extra cash. Some

asshole paid me to take out a really

great girl.

KAT

Is that right?

PATRICK

Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for

her.

PATRICK

(continuing)

You know -- it's not every day you find

a girl who'll flash her tits to get you

out of detention.

KAT

You can't just buy me a guitar every

time you screw up, you know.

PATRICK

I know

KAT

And don't just think you can

KAT

Why is my veggie burger the only burnt

object on this grill?

PATRICK

Because I like to torture you.

KAT

Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman

yearbook?

PATRICK

Don ' t you even dare. . .

CAMERON

They do to!

BIANCA

They do not!

CAMERON

Can someone please tell her that

sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?

MANDELLA

I can't remember a word of Shakespeare

right now. Isn't that weird?

KAT

You're freaked over this, aren't you?

BIANCA

He's more than freaked.  He's froke

KAT

I'd like to call your attention to

Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look

of 1995 ---

BIANCA

Patrick -- is that- a.

KAT

Perm?

PATRICK

Ask my attorney.
