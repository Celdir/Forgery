WORKER

Master Li is here!

AUNT WU

Shu Lien!

AUNT WU

Li Mu Bai is here!

LI

How's everything?

AUNT WU

Fine.  Please come in.

YU

Mu Bai...It's been too long.

LI

It has.

(he glances around

the room)

How's business?

YU

Good.  And how are you?

LI

Fine.

YU

Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan

Mountain.  He said you were

practicing deep meditation.

LI

Yes.

YU

The mountain must be so peaceful...

I envy you.  My work keeps me so

busy, I hardly get any rest.

LI

I left the training early.

YU

Why?  You're a Wudan fighter.

Training is everything.

LI

During my meditation training... I

came to a place of deep silence...

I was surrounded by light... Time

and space disappeared.  I had come

to a place my master had never told

me about.

YU

You were enlightened?

LI

No.  I didn't feel the bliss of

enlightenment.  Instead... I was

surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I

couldn't bear it.  I broke off my

meditation.  I couldn't go on.

There was something... pulling me

back.

YU

What was it?

LI

Something I can't let go of.  You

are leaving soon?

YU

We're preparing a convoy for a

delivery to Peking.

LI

Perhaps I could ask you to deliver

something to Sir Te for me.

YU

The Green Destiny Sword?  You're

giving it to Sir Te?

LI

I am.  He has always been our

greatest protector.

YU

I don't understand.  How can you

part with it?  It has always been

with you.

LI

Too many men have died at its edge.

It only looks pure because blood

washes so easily from its blade.

YU

You use it justly, you're worthy of

it.

LI

It's time for me to leave it behind.

YU

So what will you do now?

YU

Come with me to Peking.  You can

give the sword to Sir Te yourself.

It'll be just like old times.

LI

First I must visit my master's

grave.  It's been many years since

Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet

to avenge his death.  And yet I'm

thinking of quitting.  I must pray

for his forgiveness.

YU

Join me once you have finished.  I

can wait for you in Peking.

LI

Perhaps.

GUARDS

Ok.  Pass.

YU

Thanks.  Let's go into the city.

GIAO

Everything got here safely.  I'm

much obliged.

YU

Just doing my job.

GIAO

Sun Security has been the best

since your father started it.

You're a credit to his memory.

YU

Thank you.

GIAO

I mean it.

SIR TE

This is Li's personal sword, a

great hero's weapon!  He is the

only one in the world worthy of

carrying it.  It's too fine a gift.

I cannot accept it.

YU

Sir Te!  It has brought him as much

trouble as glory.  Help him to

leave these troubles behind.

Otherwise, he'll never be able to

start anew.

SIR TE

All right.  I'll act as the sword's

custodian.

DE LU

Governor Yu has arrived.

SIR TE

I must change.

YU

(getting up)

You've always been so good to Li Mu

Bai and me.  Please accept our

thanks.

SIR TE

Please do not be such a stranger.

You'll stay the night as my guest.

Now, Shu Lien... tell me something.

And forgive me for prying.  Your

father was a great friend to me,

and I think of you as my own

daughter.

YU

Please, Sir Te, what is it?

SIR TE

Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and

his warrior days... maybe he's

trying to tell you something?

YU

I don't know...

SIR TE

Don't be coy.  I've always known

about your feelings for each other.

All these years, it's a shame...

neither of you is brave enough to

admit the truth to the other.

You're both wasting precious time.

YU

I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I

aren't cowards.

SIR TE

When it comes to emotions, even

great heroes can be idiots.  Tell

me if Li Mu Bai is not more open

the next time you see him.  I'll

give him an earful!

DE LU

Sir Te said to leave the sword in

here.

DE LU

Who are you?

JEN

I'm your guest today.  I am Governor

Yu's daughter.

DE LU

This is Sir Te's study.  You are

here to...

JEN

I was looking for a quiet corner.

DE LU

I am Sir Te's head servant.  And

this is another of our guests.

JEN

It's heavy for such a thin piece of

metal!

YU

The handle is heavy.  And the blade

is no ordinary metal.  Still, the

sword is the lightest of weapons.

You're just not used to handling it.

JEN

But I have had much practice.  As a

child in the West, a platoon lived

with us.  They'd let me play with

their weapons.  The scabbard is so

beautiful.

YU

Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you

see it tainted with blood, its

beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400

years old.

JEN

Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...

YU

My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it

to Sir Te as a gift.

JEN

Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior?

Why would he give his sword to Sir

Te?

YU

You're too young to understand.

JEN

You're a sword fighter too?

YU

Yes, I am.  But I prefer the

machete.  Certain moves, however,

call for a sword.

JEN

Really?

JEN

(longingly)

It must be exciting to be a fighter,

to be totally free!

YU

Fighters have rules too: friendship,

trust, integrity... Without rules,

we wouldn't survive for long.

JEN

I've read all about people like you.

Roaming wild, beating up anyone who

gets in your way!

YU

Writers wouldn't sell many books if

they told how it really is.

JEN

But you're just like the characters

in the stories.

YU

Sure.  No place to bathe for days,

sleeping in flea-infested beds...

They tell you all about that in

those books?

JEN

You know what I mean.  I'm getting

married soon, but I haven't lived

the life I want.

YU

So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's

the most important step in a

woman's life, isn't it?

JEN

You're not married, are you?

YU

What do you think?

JEN

No!  You couldn't roam around

freely if you were.

YU

You're probably right.

SIR TE

Go ahead, Governor Yu.

SIR TE

Two feet 9 inches long.  1 inch

wide.  The handle is 1 inch deep,

2.6 inches wide.  Seven-tenths of

an inch thick.  With seven rubies

missing from the hilt.  You can

tell the design dates back to

before the Chin era.  Engraved with

a technique lost by the time of the

Han Dynasty.

GOVERNOR YU

Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

SIR TE

A sword by itself rules nothing.

It comes alive only through skillful

manipulation.

GOVERNOR YU

I see your point.  Please continue.

SIR TE

The Imperial Court isn't the

problem.  With royalty and officials

everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps

security tight.  But Peking is not

like the West.  Here, you'll find

all sorts of characters.  Proceed

with caution in your quest for law

and order.  Don't depend only on

the court.  Contacts in the Giang

Hu underworld can ensure your

position.  Be strong, yet supple.

This is the way to rule.

MAID

Governess...

GOVERNESS

Let me do it.

JEN

Please sit.

GOVERNESS

I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you

want to change into them?

JEN

Put them down.

GOVERNESS

I heard you met Shu Lien today.

JEN

Do you know her?

GOVERNESS

She's one of those.  Your mother

would not want you consorting with

her kind.

JEN

I'll socialize with whomever I

please.

GOVERNESS

Don't invite danger into your

father's house.

JEN

I'm tired now.

GOVERNESS

Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up,

and is getting married soon.  God

knows what the future will bring.

JEN

It will be just the same.  Enough!

I'm tired.

GOVERNESS

Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the

windows for you.

MASTER BO

Chilly, eh?

NIGHTMAN

Yes, Master Bo.

BO

Someone help!  Stop him!  He's on

the roof!  The sword's been stolen!

Stop thief!  Stop him!

TSAI

It's Jade Fox!

MAY

We must avenge mother!

BO

Do something!  He's getting away!

YU

Return the sword, and I'll let you

go.

YU

You've been trained at Wudan?

TSAI

You're mistaken.  We're just street

performers.  We were rehearsing.

MAY

Father!

BO

You were rehearsing?  Who are you

trying to fool?

BO

Where did that thief go?

BO

Governor Yu's house!

YU

Get down here!  Give back the sword!

DE LU

Sir Te awaits you.

BO

I'm sure the thief is in the Yu

household.

SIR TE

How dare you imply?

BO

But I say --

SIR TE

-- Enough.

YU

Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

SIR TE

Yes, though I doubt he's involved

in this.

YU

But the sword could be in his

compound.

SIR TE

Then someone's trying to set him up.

We should inform Li Mu Bai.

MADAM YU

What is it?

MAID

Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.

MADAM YU

Let me see.

GOVERNESS

Someone is after Jade Fox.

Preposterous, looking for her here!

BO

Where are they?

HOMELESS MAN

I don't know.  I haven't seen them

in two days.

MAID

There is a Miss Shu Lien here to

see you.

GOVERNESS

Miss is busy right now.

MAID

I'll tell her.

JEN

Show her in.

GOVERNESS

This spells trouble.

JEN

I have a guest.

MAID

This way please.

JEN

I've missed you.

YU

How so?

JEN

I'm bored.

YU

You're doing calligraphy?

JEN

I'll write your name.  Just for fun.

YU

I never realized my name looks like

"sword."

YU

You write gracefully.  Calligraphy

is so similar to fencing.

JEN

Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.

JEN

Please.

YU

Thank you for seeing me.  I hear

your wedding day is near.  You must

be overwhelmed by the preparations.

JEN

I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less

I think of it the better.  My

parents are arranging everything.

The Gous are a very powerful family.

My marrying one will be good for my

father's career.

YU

You are fornuate to marry into such

a noble family.

JEN

Am I?  I wish I were like the

heroes in the books I read.  Like

you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm

happy to be marrying.  But to be

free to live my own life, to choose

whom I love... That is true

happiness.

YU

Do you think so?  Let me tell you a

story.

JEN

About you and Li Mu Bai?

YU

Yes.  Did you know I was once

engaged to be married?

JEN

No, really?

YU

His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was

a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.

One day, while in battle, he was

killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's

enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went

through a lot together.  Our

feelings for each other grew

stronger.  But how could we dishonor

Meng's memory?  So the freedom you

talk about, I too desire it.  But I

have never tasted it.

JEN

Too bad for Meng, but it's not your

fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

YU

I am not an aristocrat, as you

are... but I must still respect a

woman's duties.

JEN

Don't distance us.  From now on,

let's be like sisters.

YU

Then as a sister, let me wish you

happiness in your marriage.

MADAM YU

What a godforsaken place!  Can't

your father be appointed closer to

civilization?  Jen... are you

listening to me?

TSAI

Let's go!

TSAI

Who are you?

BO

Wait!  I'm a friend!

TSAI

I don't care about your sword.

BO

Why were you spying on the Yus?

TSAI

I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox.

I'm a police inspector from Shaan

Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a

master criminal.  I hear she

infiltrated the Yus.  She must have

come with them when they transferred

here.  But with Yu's reputation, I

can't just go in and accuse her.

BO

This Jade Fox is a woman?

TSAI

Yes.

BO

Then leave her to me.

TSAI

Pardon me, but I doubt you can

handle her.  My wife was quite a

martial arts expert.  Jade Fox

killed her.  So you see, this is

personal.  Leave her to me.

MAY

It's ready!

(re: the soup)

BO

I'm ready for anything!

MAY

Father gets first dip.

TSAI

They're gone.

MAY

What does it say?

TSAI

"We'll settle this at midnight on

Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out

of her hole.

SIR TE

Shu Lien, look who's here.

LI

Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast

suspicion on Governor Yu.

YU

But something is going on at the Yu

household.

LI

What have you discovered?

LI

Jade Fox?  Impossible.

YU

You always suspected she'd fled to

the West.

LI

I didn't think she'd dare come back

to Peking!

YU

Is there any place safer than under

the nose of Governor Yu?

LI

So I shall avenge my master's death

after all.

YU

Be careful.  Sir Te requires

discretion.  Official business is

difficult enough.  Don't let

personal feelings make it worse.

And I don't know... even this

poster... could be some sort of trap.

LI

Did you see who posted it?

YU

No.

LI

It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.

On the night of the theft there was

a brawl near Yu's.  Were you

involved?

YU

It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he

followed the thief to the Yus'.

LI

Have you questioned him yet?

YU

No, not yet...

LI

But your men are watching over Yu's

compund?

YU

No, I'd already sent them home.

You can blame me for losing the

sword, but please trust that I'll

get it back soon using my own

methods.

LI

That's not what I meant.  I don't

care about the sword.

YU

What do you mean?  Didn't you come

back here for it?

LI

I don't know it was stolen until I

got here.

YU

Then, why did you come?

LI

Well, we had talked...

DE LU

Pardon my intrusion.  Master Li,

your room is ready.

LI

Thank you.  Please lead the way.

BO

The fox doesn't care much for

punctuality.  Still no sign of her.

TSAI

Enough!  Show yourself.

FOX

Tsai... you dog!  You will pay for

your stubbornness.

BO

That's what you think, old witch!

TSAI

If you surrender now, you'll suffer

less.  But if you resist, I won't

stop until you're dead.

MAY

Father!  Let me avenge my mother's

death.

FOX

You'll soon end up like her, you

little whore!

BO

You'll pay for that!

TSAI

(to Bo)

She's going to paralyze you!

TSAI

May!

FOX

Tsai, you filthy mongrel!  An ambush!

MAY

Father, are you all right?

LI

Wudan should have gotten rid of you

long ago.  It's been a long time,

Jade Fox!  You don't remember me...

But you should remember my master.

You infiltrated Wudan while I was

away.  You stole our master!  Now

it's time for you to pay!

FOX

Your master underestimated us women.

Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he

would never teach me.  He deserved

to die by a woman's hand!

LI

You stole the secrets of Wudan's

highest martial arts.  But after

ten years of training, your moves

are still undisciplined.  And

today, under a Wudan sword... you

will die!

FOX

Disciple, we'll kill them all!

FIGURE IN BLACK

Let's go!

BO

Another one!

FOX

I must get rid of Tsai!

LI

Who are you?  Why is the Green

Destiny in your possession?

FIGURE IN BLACK

What's it to you?

LI

My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green

Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be

your master.  Where did you learn

that "Xuan Piu" move?

FIGURE IN BLACK

I'm just playing around.

LI

Tell me, who is your master?

FIGURE IN BLACK

Let's go!

FOX

We must kill them!

MAY

Father!

TE

This is Tsai?

MAY

My father.  Police Inspector from

Shaan.

TE

This should be reported to Governor

Yu.  The victim is an officer.  You

believe the killer is hiding out in

his compound.

YU

I'd bet my life on it!

TE

(to Li and Yu)

Come with me.

SIR TE

This needs to be resolved, and

quickly.

LI

I'll get into the Yu household and

get her.  I'll ferret out Fox and

her gang.

YU

We must be careful.  Governor Yu is

a court official, and in charge of

security.  Any disturbance will

cast suspicion on him.  It might

get Sir Te in trouble.

SIR TE

This is a delicate matter.

YU

Sir Te, can you find some excuse to

invite Madam Yu and her daughter?

SIR TE

What do you have in mind?

YU

The best way to trap a fox is

through her cubs.

MADAM YU

Madam Te is certainly spoiling us

with these wedding gifts.  She's

being so considerate.

YU

I'm sorry she's not feeling well

enough to receive you today.

MADAM YU

I heard Sir Te lost something.  And

now Madame Te's not feeling well...

YU

We know who stole the missing item.

If the thief returns it, I'm sure

Sir Te will pursue the matter no

further.

MADAM YU

That's good.  Sometimes the help

can't keep their hands to themselves.

It's very embarassing.

YU

Sir Te knows that even well-meaning

people can make mistakes... that

can bring ruin to themselves and

their families.

MADAM YU

But don't be too lenient.

YU

No mercy will be shown toward the

murderer who turned up in Peking.

MADAM YU

A murderer?

YU

Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu

Bai's own master.  Last night, she

killed a policeman who had tracked

her down.

MADAM YU

A female criminal!  Now that's news!

JEN

You say she killed a policeman?

YU

Yes, from the West.  He went

undercover and and followed her

here,

MADAM YU

Maybe the murderer and the thief

are one and the same.

YU

I doubt it.  This thief... it very

unusual...

YU

...And most likely smarter than a

mere killer.

JEN

(formal)

Greetings, Sir Te.

SIR TE

Hello, Madam Yu.  This is Li Mu

Bai, the renowned swordsman.

LI

Delighted to meet you.

TE

Miss Yu is soon to be married.

LI

Congratulations.

MAY

Why don't you come in?

BO

I'm standing guard.

MAY

Come in.  It's cold.

MAY

Come in.  We don't have to fear

Jade Fox if we're together.

LI

Isn't it a bit too late to be out?

You've brought me the sword?

FIGURE

I do as I please.

LI

Where's your master?

FIGURE

What's it to you?

LI

Had enough flying?  You've got

potential.  You've studied the

Wudan Manual but you don't

understand it.  You need a real

master.

FIGURE

Do you think you are a real master?

LI

Like most things, I am nothing.

It's the same for this sword.  All

of it is simply a state of mind.

FIGURE

Stop talking like a monk!  Just

fight!

LI

Then tell me where Jade Fox is.

FIGURE

On guard!

LI

Real sharpness comes without effort.

LI

No growth without assistant.  No

action without reaction.  No desire

without restraint.  Now give

yourself up and find yourself again.

There is a lesson for you.

FIGURE

Go ahead.

LI

Why should I?  You need practice.

I can teach you to fight with the

Green Destiny, but first you must

learn to hold it in stillness.

FIGURE

Why do you want to teach me?

LI

I've always wanted a disciple

worthy of Wudan's secrets.

FIGURE

And if I use them to kill you?

LI

That's a risk I'm willing to take.

Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade

Fox couldn't corrupt you.

FIGURE

Wudan is a whorehouse!  Keep your

lessons!

FOX

You're home late... or should I say

early?

JEN

Why are you still here?  You killed

a policeman.  You should leave!

You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

FOX

They wouldn't have found me if you

hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a

little girl, you thought stealing

would be fun?  You, too, are

responsible for that death.  Come

with me.  You don't want to waste

your life as the wife of some

bureaucrat.  Denied your talent...

As a master and disciple we will

rule.

JEN

I'll never live as a thief!

FOX

You're already a thief.

JEN

That was just for fun.  How can I

leave?  Where would I go?

FOX

Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of

anyone in our way.  Even your father.

JEN

Shut up!

FOX

It's the Giang Hu fighter

lifestyle... kill or be killed.

Exciting, isn't it?

JEN

I owe you nothing.

FOX

Yes, you do!  You are still my

disciple.

JEN

You think you've been teaching me

all these years from the manual?

You couldn't even decipher the

symbols!

FOX

I studied the diagrams.  But you

hid the details!

JEN

You wouldn't have understood, even

if I had tried to explain.  You

know... you've gone as far as you

can go.  I hid my skills so as not

to hurt you.

FOX

If I hadn't seen you fight with Li

Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of

all you've hidden from me.

JEN

Master... I started learning from

you in secret when I was 10.  You

enchanted me with the world of

Giang Hu.  But once I realized I

could surpass you, I became so

frightened!  Everything fell apart.

I had no one to guide me, no one to

learn from.

FOX

Believe me, I've a lesson or two

left to teach you!

YU

The sword is back... are you happy?

LI

I admit, getting it back makes me

realize how much I'd missed it.

YU

But it's not your sword anymore.

You gave it to Sir Te.

LI

True.  But I must borrow it for one

last mission.  Jade Fox must die at

its edge.  Did you know what you

were hiding when you covered for

that girl?

YU

My job was to get the sword back,

without embarassing anyone.  I

wasn't about to ruin her life, or

her father's.

LI

You did your job well.  But, this

girl... I saw her last night.

YU

I knew she would intrigue you.

LI

She needs direction... and training.

YU

She's an aristocrat's daughter.

She's not one of us.  In any case,

it will all be over soon.  You'll

kill Fox, and she'll marry.

LI

That's not for her.  She should

come to Wudan and become a disciple.

YU

But Wudan does not accept women.

LI

For her, they might make an

exception.  If not, I'm afraid

she'll become a poisoned dragon.

YU

It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan

accepts her, her husband might

object.

LI

I thought by giving away the sword,

I could escape the Giang Hu world.

But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

YU

I wish there were something more I

could do to help you.

LI

Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

JEN

Lo?

LO

Jen!

JEN

You shouldn't have come.

LO

With all the traffic on your

rooftop these days... it took me a

while to get in here.  I can't wait

any longer.  I was wrong to let you

go.  Come back with me.  You'll be

happy in the desert.  You'll be

free there.

JEN

You've been looking for me all this

time?

MADAM YU

Jen... stop playing with it.

JEN

I won't break it.

GUARD A

It's Dark Cloud!  Dark Cloud is

coming!

MADAM YU

Lower the shade, don't let them see

you!

DARK CLOUD (LO)

Don't touch the women!

LO

Let's go!

LO

Come get your comb.

LO

Hurry back to your mother.

LO

She's mine.

LO

Let's stop a moment.

JEN

Give it back!

LO

(shouting a bit)

You're tired.  You need rest.  Your

horse needs water.  There's a creek

up here.

LO

Well, there used to be!  What's

your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call

me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall

or big, but I'm quick as lightning.

JEN

My comb!

LO

If you like that arrow, I can make

you a bow.  Great for hunting wild

chicken.  They're delicious.

LO

You need to eat, understand?  Then

you'll have the strength to fight.

Understand?

LO

You're eating too fast.  Slowly.

LO

You've got quite a temper.  It's

better this way.

JEN

You coward!

LO

Still in a bad mood?  At least

you're speaking.  What's your name?

LO

I didn't think the Hans had names

like that.

LO

Relax.  If I had wanted to, I would

already have done it.  You must be

dying for a bath.  Fresh water's

hard to get here.  But I managed to

bring some up.  You can wear my

clothes when you're done.  They're

clean.  Don't worry.  I'll sing, so

you'll know where I am.  After the

bath, you'll be calmer.

LO

No more hitting on the head!  All

this trouble for a comb?

JEN

It's mine.  It means a lot to me.

A barbarian like you wouldn't

understand.

LO

Not true.  I can use it to pick

fleas from my horse.

JEN

By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

LO

I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I

though you were a Han.

JEN

Give me back my comb.

LO

I don't take orders from anyone.

JEN

Give it back.

LO

When I was a boy, one night, I saw

a thousand shooting stars.  I

thought, where did they all go?

I'm an orphan.  I used to look for

stars alone.  I thought if I rode

to the other end of the desert, I'd

find them.  I've been riding in the

desert ever since.

JEN

And so, the little boy became a

fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find

the stars, so he stole my comb.

LO

Out here, you always fight for

survival.  You have to be part of a

gang to stand a chance.  Slowly,

your gang becomes your family.  All

that Dark Cloud stuff is just to

scare people and make my life easier.

JEN

So you're still that little boy

looking for shooting stars.

LO

I am a man.  And now I've found the

brightest star of all.

LO

Your father's men are looking for

you.

LO

Your father's men are still looking

for you.  They're still out there,

circling closer.

JEN

Let them look.

LO

It is trouble for me.

JEN

Don't send me back!

LO

You must decide.  You might get

tired of this life.  You might

begin to miss your family.  If it

were our daughter, we'd look for

her too.  She would miss us.  Jen...

I want you to be mine forever.  I

will make my mark on the world.  I

will earn your parents' respect.

We have a legend.  Anyone who dares

to jump from the mountain, God will

grant his wish.  Long ago, a young

man's parents were ill, so he

jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't

even hurt.  He floated away, far

away, never to return.  He knew his

wish had come true.  If you believe,

it will happen.  The elders say, "A

faithful heart makes wishes come

true."

JEN

Keep it safe.  Return it to me when

we are together again.

LO

I will.

JEN

(smiling painfully)

If you don't, I'll come after you.

And I won't let you off so easy.

LO

Wherever I went, someone always

recognized me.  I really tried.

Later, I heard you came to Peking.

I was afraid I'd never see you

again.  So I came.  I can't let you

marry.

JEN

(whispering)

Go.

LO

Jen...

JEN

(through her tears)

Don't ever come back.

LO

So it's over?

JEN

Yes.

MAID

We heard noises.

JEN

It was just a cat.

YU

You think Jade Fox will show up?

LI

She's out there, but I doubt she'll

show herself.  We'll keep our eyes

open.  Sooner or later, she'll come

for the girl.

LO

(v.o.)

Jen!  Come with me!  You're mine!

LO

Come with me to the desert!  Jen!

Come with me to Xin Jiang!

LI

Where is Jade Fox?

YU

(to Lo)

Come with me!  Hurry!

YU

(to Lo)

You thought she'd give it all up

and go back West with you?

LO

She's mine.

LI

Either way, you are no good to her

dead.  With the Gou and Yu clans

hunting you, you'll soon be in

their hands.

LO

I don't care anymore.

LI

If you truly loved her, you wouldn't

say that.

YU

Don't you want to see her again.

LI

All right.  I'll write you an

introduction.  Take it to Wudan.

Wait there for news from me.

LO

All right.

SIR TE

When will this end?  They take it,

they put it back, they take it

again.  My home is turning into a

warehouse.

TE

Speak!

BO

Jen has run away!  Gou found the

wedding chamber empty.  Governor Yu

requests your assistance.  You know

the Giang Hu underworld.  He wants

to find her, and keep her from harm.

LI

Sir Te, leave this to us.  Don't

worry.

WAITRESS

What can I serve you?

JEN

The cup is dirty.

GANGSTER A

Hello.  What is your name?

JEN

(without lifting her eyes)

Long.

GANGSTER B

It's young Master Long.  My

apologies.  I'm Iron Eagle Sung and

this is my brother in arms, Flying

Cougar Li Yun.  What brings you to

Huai An, and where are you headed,

Master Long?

JEN

Anywhere there's action.

GANGSTER A

In that case, perhaps we could be

of assistance.

JEN

Don't bother.

GANGSTER A

You don't seem to understand.

JEN

So what if I don't?

GANGSTER B

We have ways of helping you

understand.

GANGSTER A

(stunned)

Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

JEN

He is my defeated foe!

YU

Have some tea.

LI

Shu Lien... The things we touch

have no permanence.  My master

would say... there is nothing we

can hold on to in this world.  Only

by letting go can we truly possess

what is real.

YU

Not everything is an illusion.  My

hand... wasn't that real?

LI

Your hand, rough and callused from

machete practice... All this time,

I've never had the courage to touch

it.

LI

Giang Hu is a world of tigers and

dragons, full of corruption... I

tried sincerely to give it up but I

have brought us only trouble.

YU

To repress one's feelings only

makes them stronger.

LI

You're right, but I don't know what

to do.  I want to be with you...

just like this.  It gives me a

sense of peace.

WAITER

Please follow me.

JEN

I want a clean room.

WAITER

We have plenty.  Your order?

JEN

Steamed whole cod, bite-size

meatballs, a little starchy, but

keep the sauce light, shark fin

soup, mixed vegetables, and some

warm wine.

WAITER

(dazed)

I have to order from a bigger

restaurant.

JEN

Hurry then.

GIANG HU A

That's him.

MI BIAO

I am Iron Arm Mi.  I heard a true

master has arrived.  I have come to

seek a lesson.

MI BIAO

(bristles)

You asked for it!

JEN

What kind of Iron Arm are you?

FLYING MACHETE CHANG

You have amazing technique!  I am

Flying Machete.  Are you related to

Southern Crane?

JEN

Southern Duck?  I don't eat anything

with two feet.  Who could remember

such long-winded names?

GOU JUN SIHUNG

Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and

you don't know his master, Southern

Crane?

JEN

Who are you?

GOU JUN SIHUNG

I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

JEN

(furious)

Gou?  I hate that name.  It makes

me puke!  Too bad you're named Gou.

You'll be the first to feel my

sword today.

MONK JING

Hold it!  Don't you know Monk Jing?

JEN

A monk, in a place like this?  You

need a lesson!

MONK JING

Who are you?

JEN

Who am I?  I am... I am the

Invincible Sword Goddess.  Armed

with the Incredible... Green

Destiny.  Be you Li or Southern

Crane... lower your head... and ask

for mercy.  I am the desert dragon.

I leave no trace.  Today I fly over

Eu-Mei.  Tomorrow... I'll kick over

Wudan Mountain!

FLYING MACHETE CHANG

We politely asked for a friendly

match, but she showed no respect,

and attacked us.  Everyone came by

to teach her a lesson.

MI BIAO

Her sword was just too powerful.

MONK JING

I've traveled everywhere, but never

met anyone so uncivilized.

SHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD

(heavily bandaged)

She kept accusing me of being Gou

Jun Pei's brother.  Who is this

Gou, anyway?

YU

Her husband.

LI

(to Yu)

We're close to your headquarters.

Go home and check in.

YU

What about you?

LI

I'll look around and catch up later.

YU

Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get

a good night's sleep at headquarters.

SECURITY MAN A

Mistress, you're back.

YU

It's you!  How's everything here?

CAPTAIN

Fine.  You've been gone a while.

YU

Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.

Your wife was due?

AH WAI

Yeah, a baby girl.

YU

Good!

AH WAI

I'll be happy if she's half as

strong as you.

YU

Mrs. Wu...

AUNT WU

You're back!

YU

How's the arm?  Still sore?

AUNT WU

Much better.  You've been gone so

long.

YU

Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the

night.

AUNT WU

(excited)

I'll go and make up his room!

JEN

Sister Shu Lien...

YU

Here you must be in proper attire.

JEN

I'm just borrowing some clean

clothes.  I'm not staying.

YU

I'll give them to you.

JEN

I was just passing by and wondered

how you were.

JEN

You, sister...

YU

Look at the trouble you've caused.

Now you know what Giang Hu life is

really like.  If you think of me as

your sister, let me give you some

sisterly advice.  You can run from

marriage, but not your parents.

JEN

They forced me to marry!

YU

Go back to them first.  Then you

can decide about Lo.

JEN

You know about Lo?

YU

He really loves you.  Come back to

Peking with me.  We'll find a

solution.

JEN

Where is he now?

YU

Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.

He sent him to Wudan Mountain.

JEN

You're working together to set me

up!  I'm leaving!

YU

How dare you accuse us?  I always

knew you had stolen the sword!

I've done nothing but protect you

and your family.  And you're repaid

me with nothing but contempt.  Li

Mu Bai himself spared you, and all

you do is insult him.  We wanted

some peace and you've ruined it all!

You're no sister of mine!

JEN

What do I care?  You were never a

real friend anyway.  But I wonder,

how long could you last as my enemy?

YU

Put the sword down!

YU

(calling out)

Jen!

YU

Everyone out.  Shut the doors.

YU

Fine... the friendship is over.

YU

Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's

sword.

JEN

Come and get it if you can.

YU

Without the Green Destiny, you are

nothing.

JEN

Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead.

Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go

ahead.

YU

Give me the sword.

JEN

Take it!

LI

(enraged)

Stop it!  You don't deserve the

Green Destiny.

JEN

Not another lecture!  On guard!

LI

Let's end this here.

JEN

Only the sword will settle this.

LI

I only let you go because I wanted

to see the real you.

JEN

What do you know about a true heart?

JEN

What do you want?

LI

What I've always wanted, to teach

you.

JEN

All right.  If you can take back

the sword in three moves, I'll go

with you.

JEN

Give it back!

LI

Kneel!

JEN

Never!

LI

Then you have no use for the sword.

FOX

Sooner or later, they'd drag you

back to Peking.  Your parents will

never accept you again.  But why go

home?  We've gone this far, we

won't stop now.  You'll always be

my lady.  At last, we'll be our own

masters.  We'll be happy.  That's

the most important thing.  All we

have left is each other, right?

Lie down and rest.

AUNT WU

She's crazy.  You should have

killed her.

YU

I didn't have the heart.

AUNT WU

Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.

JEN

Is it me or the sword you want?

LI

You've been drugged!

LI

Where is Jade Fox?

YU

What happened?

LI

Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you

get here?

YU

We followed Jade Fox.

LI

And so you die.

FOX

And so shall you!

YU

A poisoned needle!

FOX

You deserve to die, but the life I

was hoping to take... was Jen's.

Ten years I devoted to you.  But

you deceived me!  You hid the

manual's true meaning.  I never

improved... but your progress was

limitless!  You know what poison is?

An eight-year-old girl, full of

deceit.  That's poison!  Jen!  My

only family... my only enemy...

YU

You can't die!  Tell us what poison

you used!  You can't die!  Tell us

the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu

Bai die!

JEN

She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin

poison.  It goes straight to the

heart.

LI

My blood will soon reverse its flow.

It's the same poison she used to

kill my master.  There is no

antidote.

YU

That can't be!  Everything has an

antithesis!  Why not this?

JEN

The antidote exists.  She taught it

to me.  The formula is simple, but

it takes time to prepare.  Trust me.

As you have helped me, let me help

you.

LI

All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on

as long as I can.

YU

(takes the comb from

her hair)

Take my horse and go to the compound.

Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help

you.  Hurry!

JEN

Spare your energy.  I'll be back!

JEN

Where is Mrs. Wu?

AUNT WU

Stop it!

JEN

Shu Lien told me to show you this.

AUNT WU

Let her in.

YU

Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some

hope...

LI

Shu Lien...

YU

Save your strength.

LI

My life is departing.  I've only

one breath left.

YU

Use it to meditate.  Free yourself

from this world as you have been

taught.  Let your soul rise to

eternity with your last breath.  Do

not waste it... for me.

LI

I've already wasted my whole life.

I want to tell you with my last

breath... I have always loved you.

I would rather be a ghost, drifting

by your side... as a condemned

soul... than enter heaven without

you.  Because of your love... I

will never be a lonely spirit.

JEN

He's gone?

YU

Bo... please take this sword back

to Sir Te.

YU

(to Jen)

Now you must go to Wudan Mountain.

Lo awaits you there.  Promise me

one thing, whatever path you take

in this life... be true to yourself.

JEN

Do you remember the legend of the

young man?

LO

"A faithful heart makes wishes come

true."

JEN

Make a wish, Lo.

LO

(closing his eyes)

To be back in the desert, together

again.
