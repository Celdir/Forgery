turn onto a street in the West 80s.

KATHLEEN

Good morning.

FRANK

(as he reads)

Listen to this -- the entire work force

of the state of Virginia had to have

solitaire removed from their computers --

FRANK

(continuing)

-- because they hadn't done any work in

six weeks.

KATHLEEN

Aren't you late?

FRANK

(continuing)

You know what this is, you know what

we're seeing here?  We're seeing the end

of Western civilization as we know it.

KATHLEEN

This is so sad.

FRANK

(points at her computer)

You think that machine is your friend,

but it's not.

(checks his watch)

I'm late.

KATHLEEN (O.C.)

I'll see you tonight.

FRANK

Sushi.

KATHLEEN (O.C.)

Great.  Bye.

COMPUTER

Welcome.

COMPUTER (cont'd)

You've got mail.

Re: Brinkley

KATHLEEN

Brinkley is my dog.  He loves the streets

of New York as much as I do --

JOE (V.O.)

-- although he likes to eat bits of pizza

and bagel off the sidewalk, and I prefer

to buy them.  Brinkley is a great catcher

and was offered a tryout on the Mets farm

team --

(continued)

JOE (cont'd)

-- but he chose to stay with me so that

he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on

a large green pillow the size of an inner

tube.  Don't you love New York in the

fall?  It makes me want to buy school

supplies.  I would send you a bouquet of

newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your

name and address.  On the other hand,

this not knowing has its charms.

VOICE

Darling --

JOE

Mmmmmhmmm --

PATRICIA

I'm late.

(indicating the newspaper)

Random House fired Dick Atkins.  Good

riddance.  Murray Chilton died.  Which

makes one less person I'm not speaking

to --

(she drains a cup of espresso

as a second starts to come out

of the machine)

Vince got a great review.  He'll be

insufferable.  Tonight,  PEN dinner --

JOE

Am I going?

PATRICIA

You promised.

JOE

Can't I just give them money?  That's the

cause?  Free Albanian writers?  I'm for

that.

JOE

All right, I'll go.  You're late.

PATRICIA

I know I know I know.

JOE & THE COMPUTER (TOGETHER)

Welcome... You've got mail.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I like to start my notes to you as if

we're already in the middle of a

conversation.  I pretend that we're

the oldest and dearest friends --

as opposed to what we actually are,

people who don't know each other's names

and met in a Chat Room where we both

claimed we'd never been before.

KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)

What will he say today, I wonder.  I turn

on my computer, I wait impatiently as it

boots up.

KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)

I go on line, and my breath catches in my

chest until I hear three little words:

You've got mail.

KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)

I hear nothing, not even a sound on the

streets of New York, just the beat of my

own heart.  I have mail.  From you.

KATHLEEN

Hello, Christina.  It's a beautiful day.

Isn't it the most beautiful day?

CHRISTINA

I guess.  Yeah, sure.

KATHLEEN

Don't you love New York in the fall?

CHRISTINA

What's going on with you?

KATHLEEN

Nothing.

CHRISTINA

You're in love.

KATHLEEN

In love?  No.  Yes.  Of course I am.

I'm in love with Frank.  I'm practically

living with Frank.  Do you think you

could get our Christmas mailers out this

week?

CHRISTINA

By Monday I promise.  I have a paper due

Friday.  Now what's going on?

(she looks at Kathleen)

I'm just going to stand here till you tell

me.

KATHLEEN

Is it infidelity if you're involved with

someone on E-mail?

CHRISTINA

Have you had sex?

KATHLEEN

Of course not.  I don't even know him.

CHRISTINA

I mean cybersex.

KATHLEEN

No!

CHRISTINA

Well, don't do it.  The minute you do,

they lose all respect for you.

KATHLEEN

It's not like that.  We just E-mail.

It's really nothing, on top of which I'm

definitely thinking of stopping because

it's getting --

CHRISTINA

Out of hand?

KATHLEEN

Confusing.  But not really.  Because it's

nothing.

CHRISTINA

Where did you meet him?

KATHLEEN

I can't even remember.

(off Christina's look)

The day I turned thirty I wandered into

the Over Thirty Room for a joke, sort of

and he was there, and we started

chatting.

CHRISTINA

About what?

KATHLEEN

Books.  Music.  How much we both love New

York.  Harmless.  Harmless.  Meaningless.

(starts smiling)

Bouquets of sharpened pencils.

CHRISTINA

Excuse me?

KATHLEEN

Forget it.  We don't talk about anything

personal.  We made a rule about that.

I don't know his name, what he does or

exactly where he lives, so it will be

really easy to stop seeing him, because

I'm not.

CHRISTINA

God, he could be the next person to talk

into the store.  He could be...

(as George walks in)

George.

GEORGE

Morning.

CHRISTINA

Are you On Line?

GEORGE

As far as I'm concerned, the Internet is

just another way to be rejected by a

woman.

KATHLEEN

Good morning, Birdie.

BIRDIE

What are you all talking about?

CHRISTINA

Cybersex.

BIRDIE

I tried to have cybersex once but I kept

getting a busy signal.

CHRISTINA

I know, I know.  One Saturday night I was

really depressed about not having a date,

so I thought, no problemo, I'll go on

line and I won't be lonely, but I

couldn't get on, there were hundreds of

thousands of people who didn't have dates

trying to get on.

(MORE)

You have to wonder which is harder,

getting a date or getting On Line when

you don't have a date.

GEORGE

Getting a date is harder.

KATHLEEN

(to the kids)

Jessica and Maia, how are you today?

KATHLEEN

Hey, you forgot to pick up the garbage

last week and I got a ticket.  And you're

late today -- I could have gotten

another.

GARBAGEMAN #1

We were here, there was no garbage.

GARBAGEMAN #2

Yeah.

KATHLEEN

Of course there was --

GARBAGEMAN #1

What do you think, I don't want to pick

up garbage?  You think I go up and down

the street picking up garbage, I'm not

going to pick up yours?  What's the

matter with you?

GARBAGEMAN #2

Yeah.

GARBAGEMAN #1

You don't even bundle it right, you're

supposed to bundle it and leave it near

the curb, you leave it near the store

and you use cheap garbage bags, they

smear all over the place, and then I got

to pick it up with my shovel --

GARBAGEMAN #1

And now you're busting my chops.  You're

just another garbage pick-up to us, okay?

GARBAGEMAN #2

Yeah.

KATHLEEN

That guy went ballistic on me.

CHRISTINA

I hope you told him off.

KATHLEEN

Not exactly.

KEVIN

The electrical contractor called.  His

truck hit a deer last night, he won't be

in 'til tomorrow.  The shelves are late

because the shipment of pine had beetles.

And there's some question about whether

we're installing the stairs in the right

spot --

JOE

That sounds great.

KEVIN

Testing one two three four.

JOE

Is the electrician here?

KEVIN

I just told you -- he hit a deer.

JOE

I hear nothing.  Not a sound on the city

streets, just the beat of my own heart.

I think that's the way it goes.

Something like that.

KEVIN

(beginning to glean something)

Did you and Patricia get engaged?

JOE

Engaged?  Are you crazy?

KEVIN

I thought you liked Patricia --

JOE

I love Patricia.  Patricia's amazing.

Patricia makes coffee nervous.

(suddenly all business)

Are we still on schedule?

KEVIN

We open two weeks before Thanksgiving.

JOE

I guess we should announce ourselves

soon.  Tell people we're coming.

KEVIN

This is the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

The minute they hear they'll be lining up

--

JOE

-- to picket --

KEVIN

-- the big bad --

JOE

--chain store --

KEVIN

-- that destroys --

JOE

-- everything we hold dear.  But we'll

seduce them with our square footage and

our deep armchairs and our amazingly

swift checkout lines and our discounts

and our...

JOE & KEVIN

(the trump card)

-- cappuccino.

JOE

They hate us in the beginning, but we

get them in the end.  Meanwhile we

should just put up a sign -- Coming soon,

a Foxbooks Superstore and The End of

Western Civilization As We Know It.

JOE

Kevin and I are both a little concerned

about the neighborhood response --

(suddenly notices the garish

couch)

What is this fabric?  Does it have a

name?

NELSON

Money.  Its name is money.

JOE

Gillian selected it.

NELSON

Of course.

SCHUYLER

Your father is getting married again.

JOE

Oh, great, congratulations, Dad.  Why?

NELSON

Who knows?  Why does anyone get married?

JOE

Love.

NELSON

Yes, that is one reason.

SCHUYLER

I think you're a damn fool.

NELSON

Dad, Matthew is four.  It would be nice

for him if his parents were married.

SCHUYLER

Annabel is eight and I'm not married to

her mother.  I can't even remember her

mother's name.

(he laughs merrily)

JOE

I have a very sad announcement to make.

City Books on 23rd Street is going under

...

NELSON

Another independent bookstore bites the

dust --

SCHUYLER

On to the next.

JOE

And I'm buying their entire stock --

architecture, New York history -- for the

new store.

NELSON

How much are your paying?

JOE

Whatever it costs, it won't be as much as

this exquisite mohair episode.

(indicates the couch)

We're also going to have a section on

West Side Writers --

SCHUYLER

-- as a sop to the neighborhood.

NELSON

Perfect.  It'll keep those West Side

liberal nut pseudo-intellectual bleeding

hearts --

JOE

Readers.  They're called readers.

NELSON

Don't romanticize them.  It'll keep them

from jumping down your throat --

SCHUYLER

What's the competition?

JOE

One mystery store.  Sleuth, on 86th and

Amsterdam.  And a children's bookstore.

The Shop Around the Corner.  Been there

forever.

SCHUYLER

Cecilia's store.

JOE

Who's that?

SCHUYLER

Cecilia Kelly, lovely woman.  I think we

might have had a date once.  Or maybe we

just exchange letters.

JOE

You wrote her letters?

SCHUYLER

Mail.  It was called mail.

NELSON

(fondly nostalgic and kidding

it slightly)

Stamps.  Envelopes.

JOE

Wait.  I've heard of it.  It was a means

of communication before I was born.

NELSON

Exactly.

SCHUYLER

Cecilia had beautiful penmanship.

She was too young for me, but she was...

enchanting.  Her daughter owns it now.

NELSON

Too bad for her.

COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)

Welcome.  You've got mail.

JOE (V.O.)

My father is getting married again.  For

five years he's been living with a woman

who studied decorating at Caesar's

Palace.

COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)

You've got mail.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

Once I read a story about a butterfly in

the subway, and today I saw one. I

couldn't believe it.  It got on at 42nd

--

(continued)

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

-- and got off at 59th, where I assume it

was going to Bloomindale's to buy a hat

that will turn out to be a mistake.  As

almost all hats are.

JOE (V.O.)

Did you know that every night a truck

pulls up to H&H Bagels and pumps about a

ton of flour into the ground?  The air is

absolutely amazing.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I guess I've read Pride & Prejudice about

100 times --

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

-- and every time I read it I worry that

Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are not going to

get together -- but the truth is whenever

I think about my favorite book I always

think about the books I read as a child --

JOE (V.O.)

Did you ever read Homer Price?  My all-

time favorite children's book.

(continued)

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

There's a doughnut machine in it that

won't stop making doughnuts, they just

keep coming down the chute just as

regular as a clock can tick.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

Have you been to Krispy Kreme?

(continued)

KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)

There's a doughnut machine right in the

window that makes 110 dozen doughnuts an

hour.

TV REPORTER

The body of a woman was found this

morning on the roof of a New York

building...

TV REPORTER

Here is a resident of the building.  Your

name, please?

GEORGE

George Pappas.

REPORTER

Did you see or hear anything unusual last

night?

GEORGE

No.  I didn't go out.

REPORTER

The victim was red-haired, about thirty-

five, wearing a jogging suit.  Did you

encounter anyone by that description

in the building?  Sir?

REPORTER

Have there been any wild parties

lately?

REPORTER

Could it perhaps be one of your

neighbors?

REPORTER

(to camera)

As you can see, no one here knows

anything.

CHRISTINA

(totally mystified)

What?

GEORGE

The

coup de foudre

. I had one. I

never believed in them, but I just had

one.

BIRDIE

Is that the thing where you get cold

suddenly, bang?

CHRISTINA

No, that's the

coup de vieux

.

BIRDIE

I had that.

GEORGE

The

coup de foudre

love suddenly, bang.  A thunderbolt.

BIRDIE

I had that too.  Only I had it in

Seville, where it was called ,

el

estruendo de amor

.

GEORGE

I don't know her name, or anything about

her.  I may never see her again.

CHRISTINA

And if you ever do meet her, you'll find

out all the horrible details, and that

will be that.  She'll turn out to have

pictures of the Virgin Mary all over the

walls.

GEORGE

I won't care.

KATHLEEN

Can someone help me out here?

CHRISTINA

George had a

coup de foudre

.

GEORGE

And Christina's making fun of me.

KATHLEEN

Don't let her.  I believe in this, I

completely believe in this.  It happened

to Madame Bovary, at least six times.

CHRISTINA

And she was wrong every time.

KATHLEEN

Yes!

(beat)

Who was she?

GEORGE

I don't know.  She was standing outside

my building with the police and the

reporters.

KATHLEEN

What police and reporters?

GEORGE

Someone died.

KATHLEEN

Who?

GEORGE

I have no idea about that either.

They found her on the roof.

KATHLEEN

A dead body.  That's so sad.  But

you fell in love.  That's so great.

GEORGE

Oh.  One other thing.

CHRISTINA

Quel nightmare.

KATHLEEN

It has nothing to do with us. It's

big, impersonal, overstocked and

full of ignorant salespeople.

GEORGE

But they discount.

KATHLEEN

But they don't provide any service.  We

do.

KATHLEEN

So really it's a good development.  You

know how in the flower district, there

are all these flower shops in a row so

you can find whatever you want.  Well,

this is going to be the book district.

If you don't have it, we do.

BIRDIE

And vice versa.

FRANK

When you are finished with Foxbooks, the

Shop Around the Corner is going to be

responsible for reversing the entire

course of the Industrial Revolution.

KATHLEEN

That is so sweet, Frank.  Thank you.

That is so sweet.

FRANK

Hey --

KATHLEEN

Although...

FRANK

What?

KATHLEEN

(over his shoulder, she notices

the typewriter, breaks from

the hug)

What is that doing there?

FRANK

Listen to it.  Just listen--

FRANK

The Olympia Report deluxe Electric

Report.  As in gunshot.

KATHLEEN

That sound is familiar.

FRANK

Now listen to this.

KATHLEEN

That whirring?

FRANK

The gentle and soothing lullaby of a

piece of machinery so perfect --

KATHLEEN

I know where I've heard it before.  I

know.

FRANK

I needed a backup.

KATHLEEN

Don't you have another one at your

apartment?

FRANK

I might, I might.  So what?

KATHLEEN

You're turning my apartment into a

typewriter museum.

FRANK

I'll stop.  I'll try.  I probably can't.

I see one and my knees go weak.  Anyway,

what were you starting to say?

KATHLEEN

When?

FRANK

Before.

KATHLEEN

Nothing.

FRANK

Come on.

KATHLEEN

I don't know.  I was just wondering about

my work and all.  I mean, what is it I do

exactly?  All I really do is run a

bookstore --

FRANK

All you really do is this incredibly

noble thing --

KATHLEEN

But I don't know if I --

FRANK

(stopping her)

Kathleen --

KATHLEEN

But I just --

FRANK

You are a lone reed.

FRANK

You are a lone reed waving in the

breeze standing strong and tall in

the corrupt sands of commerce.

KATHLEEN

(reading from it)

I am a lone reed.

(tries it on again)

I am a lone reed.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

Sometimes I wonder about my life.  I lead

a small life.  Well, not small, but

circumscribed.  And sometimes I wonder,

do I do it because I like it, or because

I haven't been brave?  So much of what I

see reminds me of something I read in a

book, when shouldn't it be the other way

around?

(continued)

KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)

I don't really want an answer.  I just

want to send this cosmic question out

into the void.  So goodnight, dear void.

CHRISTINA

I went to the Foxbooks Website and you

can buy anything.  They ship it to you

in a day.  Maybe we should get a website.

KATHLEEN

My mother would never have wanted us to

have a website.  "Every book you sell is

a gift from your heart."  She always said

that.

CHRISTINA

What if they put us out of business?

KATHLEEN

It's out of the question.  We're a

fixture in the neighborhood.  We're

practically a landmark.

(indicating the binders)

Men For Women, Women for Men, Women for

Women -- what is this?

CHRISTINA

You fill out one of these forms and they

file it in the book and if someone wants

to meet you, they arrange it.

KATHLEEN

What a stupid way to meet someone.

CHRISTINA

Compared to the Internet?

KATHLEEN

My little thing on the Internet is just

a lark.

CHRISTINA

So it's still going on?

KATHLEEN

And I do not plan to meet him.

(indicating the book)

Why do I get the feeling that you are in

here somewhere?

CHRISTINA

I came in here one night and drank too

much coffee and filled one out.

(off Kathleen's look)

Well how am I supposed to meet someone?

KATHLEEN

You are a runner.  Some day you will make

eye contact with another runner and --

CHRISTINA

No one ever even looks at me.  They

don't.  On top of which, who are they?

They could like the symphony.  I could

never fall in love with someone who

likes to go to the symphony --

KATHLEEN

I know.  What are you supposed to do

there?

CHRISTINA

I don't know.

KATHLEEN

Sit.  You're supposed to sit.

CHRISTINA

I could never fall in love with anyone

who smokes cigars either.

KATHLEEN

I'll tell you what I hate.  Big fat legs

like stumps.

CHRISTINA

Yeah.  I hate that too.

KATHLEEN

The worst, the worst -- I could never,

under any circumstances, love anybody

who had a sailboat.

CHRISTINA

Neither could I.

KATHLEEN

If I had to get up on Saturday morning

knowing that I was about to go down to

the pier and unravel all those ropes and

put on all that sunblock --

CHRISTINA

All that talk about the wind.

KATHLEEN

And then you have to go out on the boat,

and you sail and sail and sail until you

are bored witless, and then, only then,

do they say, let's turn around and you

realize the trip is only half over, only

it's not, because the wind has changed --

CHRISTINA

It hasn't changed.  It's died.

KATHLEEN

So then there's more talk about the wind.

While you just float up and down trying

not to get nauseous.  And when you

finally get back, you have to clean up

the boat.

CHRISTINA

Why don't people have boat maids?

KATHLEEN

I know.  There're all these people who

wouldn't be caught dead polishing a

doorknob in their house but put them on

a boat and they want to rub down

everything in sight.

ANNABEL

Joe --

JOE

Hello.

(picks up Annabel)

Annabel, how are you today?

ANNABEL

Great.

JOE

(picks up Matt)

Hey, big guy --

GILLIAN

Don't I get a hello?

JOE

Hello, Gillian.

GILLIAN

Kiss me.  I'm going to be your wicked

stepmother.

JOE

Who is this?

GILLIAN

Nanny Maureen.  I brought her in case

you couldn't handle the kids.

ANNABEL

Maureen's getting a divorce.

JOE

I'm sorry to hear that.

MAUREEN

It's my own fault.  Never marry a man

who lies.

JOE

That is so wise.  Remember that, Annabel.

ANNABEL

She taught Matt to spell his name.

MATT

Fox. F-O-X.

JOE

Excellent, Matt.

(to Maureen)

Good work.  You can have the day off.

I'll take over from here.

(to Gillian)

You must be late for something.

Volunteer work at the Henry Street

Settlement.  Packing bandages for

Bosnian refugees.  A course in

Chinese literature at Columbia.

GILLIAN

I am.  I'm having my eggs harvested.

KATHLEEN

This is her best friend Tacy, whose real

name is Anastasia, and then in the next

book Betsy and Tacy become friends with

Tib, whose real name, I am sorry to tell

you, is Thelma.

GEORGE

The illustrations are hand-tipped,

which is why --

JOE

It costs so much.

GEORGE

It's why it's

worth

ANNABEL

I want all of them.

KATHLEEN

That might be an awful lot for your dad

to buy at one time.

ANNABEL

My dad gets me all the books I want.

KATHLEEN

(looking over at Joe)

Well, that's very nice of him.

ANNABEL

That's not my dad.  That's my nephew --

KATHLEEN

Oh, I don't really think that's your

nephew --

JOE

It's true.  Annabel is my aunt.  Aren't

you, Aunt Annabel?

ANNABEL

And Matt is --

KATHLEEN

Let me guess.

(to Matt)

Are you his uncle?

MATT

No.

KATHLEEN

His grandfather?

KATHLEEN (cont'd)

His great-grandfather?

MATT

(shouting with glee)

I'm his brother.

JOE

Annabel is my grandfather's daughter.

And Matt is my father's son.  We are an

American family.

ANNABEL

What is that?

KATHLEEN

A handkerchief.  Oh my, do children not

even know what handkerchiefs are?  A

handkerchief is a Kleenex you don't throw

away.  My mother embroidered it for me --

you see?  My initials and a daisy,

because daisies are my favorite flower.

ANNABEL

Orchids are my favorite flower.

KATHLEEN

(to Joe)

You know what else children don't know?

They don't know what a telephone booth

is?

JOE

Who are you?

KATHLEEN

Kathleen Kelly.  I own this store.

Are you are?

JOE

Joe.  Just call me Joe.

(quickly)

We'll take these books.

KATHLEEN

These are wonderful books.  As Annabel

gets older the characters in the books do,

too.

(to Annabel)

You can grow up with Betsy.

GEORGE

You're going to come back again, aren't

you?

JOE

Of course.

GEORGE

This is why we're never going to go

under.  Our customers are loyal.

KATHLEEN

(by way of explanation)

They're opening a Foxbooks around the

corner.

ANNABEL

Foxbooks!  My Daddy --

JOE

(gently putting his hand over

her mouth)

-- likes to buy at discount.  Don't tell

anyone that, Annabel, it's nothing to be

proud of --

MATT

(spelling)

F-O-X.

KATHLEEN

That's amazing.  You can spell fox.  Can

you spell dog?

MATT

F-O-X.

JOE

Matt, look at this dinosaur book.

Wouldn't you like a dinosaur book?

Annabel, maybe you could read this to

Matt while I wrap things up here.

(moves them to a corner, to

them quickly)

Sit down, read, and don't listen to

anything I say.

JOE

And the dinosaur book too.

KATHLEEN

The world is not driven by discounts,

believe me.  I've been in business

forever.  I started helping my mother

here after school when I was six years

old.  I used to watch her, and it wasn't

that she was selling books, it was that

she was helping people become whoever

they were going to turn out to be.  When

you read a book as a child it becomes

part of your identity in a way that no

other reading in your life does.

(stops herself)

I guess I've gotten carried away.

JOE

You have, and you've made me feel...

JOE (cont'd)

Enchanting, your mother was enchanting.

KATHLEEN

She was.  How did you know that?

JOE

Lucky guess.

KATHLEEN

Anyway.  She left the store to me, and

I'm going to leave it to my daughter.

JOE

How old is your daughter now?

KATHLEEN

Oh, I'm not married.  But eventually.

KATHLEEN

So Foxbooks can...

KATHLEEN AND GEORGE TOGETHER

Go to hell.

KATHLEEN

(handing him his books)

Here you go.

JOE

We ready?

ANNABEL

Bye, Kathleen.

KATHLEEN

Goodbye, Annabel.  Bye, Matt.  What

about cat?  Can you spell cat?

MATT

F-O-X.

PATRICIA (cont'd)

And now, the book you've all been waiting

for, the book it's been my dreams to

publish.  The legendary Veronica Grant

has written her memoirs --

PATRICIA (cont'd)

-- and I'm happy to report it is just

crammed with tragedy.

(she laughs gaily)

Just kidding, but seriously, it's all

here: poverty, addiction, divorce,

tracheotomies --

PATRICIA (cont'd)

-- her third husband beat her up, hip

replacement, and an amazing face lift

where all the injected fat fell to her

chin.

PATRICIA (cont'd)

This book is fabulous.  And even if it

weren't, it would sell like crazy,

because Veronica is going to plug it to

death on every talk show in America.

This book...

PATRICIA (cont'd)

I'm sorry.  I can't talk about it without

crying.  Veronica and I have so much in

common -- well, not all the sad parts --

but we were both famous by the time we

were 29 and, believe me, that's rough.

(wipes her nose with a Kleenex,

pulling herself together)

Anyway, I just want to say that I'm

especially thrilled to be publishing it.

Veronica lives in my building and we met

in the elevator.  By the time we had

traveled from the eighth floor to the

first, we had a deal.  First printing:

one million copies.

SARAH

(quickly)

You have a dentist appointment in twenty

minutes.  So you should leave soon...

PATRICIA

What's my car number?

SARAH

Car?  You didn't say anything about a car

--

PATRICIA

Are you an idiot?  Of course I need a car.

God!

PATRICIA

Taxi!  Taxi!  Taxi!

PATRICIA

Excuse me -- what are you doing?  This is

my taxicab.

(to the driver)

Don't take him.  I am telling you right

now, and I am memorizing your number,

don't take him.

(to the man)

Who the fuck do you think you are?

MAN IN OVERCOAT

Are you going uptown?

PATRICIA

Yes.

MAN IN OVERCOAT

Get in.  I'll drop you.

PATRICIA

Veronica, it's Patricia, you should have

been there, it was unbelievable, we're

going to sell truckloads of your book.

Call me.

MAN IN OVERCOAT

Are you an editor?

PATRICIA

Yes.

MAN IN OVERCOAT

I am a rabbi.

PATRICIA

Oh, my God, I said fuck to a rabbi.  I'm

sorry.

MAN IN OVERCOAT

I hope you don't mind my asking, but are

you Jewish?

PATRICIA

Yes.

MAN IN OVERCOAT

You should come to our temple.

PATRICIA

I'm not really religious.

MAN IN OVERCOAT

Oh, I am surprised, you seem like a very

religious person.

PATRICIA

You're kidding, right?

MAN IN OVERCOAT

We are at West End Avenue and 83rd

Street.  Every Friday night, we have a

joyous time, everyone dancing, everyone

singing.  Also some wisdom.  Perhaps you

have heard of us, we are known as The

Singles Temple.

MAN IN OVERCOAT

It's a very good place to calm down.

MAN IN OVERCOAT

Oh, look, I am already here.  Very nice

to meet you.

(gives the cabbie money)

Take this woman to her destination.

PATRICIA

Goodbye.

FRANK

I saw him.  I actually saw him.

KATHLEEN

Who?

FRANK

I can't believe it.  I saw William

Spungeon.

KATHLEEN

I thought he was in Mexico.

FRANK

Maybe he's in Mexico, but today he was in

New York.  The most brilliant and

reclusive novelist in the history of the

world is here, in this neighborhood.  He

may be living on this very block.

KATHLEEN

Where did you see him?

FRANK

I was on the subway --

FRANK (V.O.)

-- and this musician got onto the train --

FRANK (V.O.)

-- and I suddenly saw him, sitting

directly across from me doing the

crossword puzzle.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

How'd you know it was him?

FRANK (V.O.)

He looked exactly the same as his high

school yearbook picture, which happens to

be the last photograph ever taken of him.

FRANK

So I followed him.

FRANK (V.O.)

He went into H&H and bought a bagel

with everything.

FRANK (V.O.)

He dropped his crossword into the

garbage and I rescued it.

FRANK (V.O.)

Then he went into a sporting good store

and bought tube socks, 6 pair for $7.99.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

William Spungeon and tube socks.

FRANK (V.O.)

I know.  I don't want to dwell on it.

FRANK (V.O.)

And then I lost him.

FRANK

Do you know what this is worth?

FRANK

What I was thinking as I was trailing him

was that eventually I would have the

courage to say hello to him, you know,

not in a horrible, intrusive or slavering

fan-slash-acolyte kind of way, but more

like, "Hi."  "How ya doing?"  "Have you

ever thought about trading up in the sock

area?"  "Who knows, maybe he's read my

work -- and then we'd become friends, and

eventually I'd introduce him to you --

you know how much he loves children's

books, there's a whole long section in

Relativity's Smile about The Wizard of Oz

-- and then maybe he'd come out of hiding

so he could help save the store.

KATHLEEN

What are you talking about?

FRANK

From Foxbooks.  I mean, if things got

tough, he could help rally support --

KATHLEEN

It's never going to get to that.  The

store is fine.

FRANK

I don't even know why you would say that?

KATHLEEN

Neither do I.  It just flew out of my

mouth.

FRANK

There's enough business for us all.

KATHLEEN

I mean, we're fine.

FRANK

You're more than fine, you're absolutely

fine.

KATHLEEN

We're fine.

FRANK

Hey, Vince.  Congratulations.  You know

Kathleen Kelly.

VINCE

How are you?

FRANK

Guess who I saw today on the subway?

William Spungeon.

VINCE

I thought he was in Mexico.

PATRICIA

Would you get me another drink, sweetie?

I'm all out.

(continues chattering)

So then the rabbi says, "It's a very good

place to calm down."  Isn't that

hysterical?

JOE

Absolut on the rocks.

KATHLEEN

A white wine, please.

(very friendly)

Oh, hello.

JOE

Hi.

KATHLEEN

Remember me, from the bookstore?

JOE

Of course I remember you.

KATHLEEN

How's your aunt?

JOE

Good.  She's good.

(gets his drink)

I have to deliver this.  I have a very

thirsty date.  She's part camel.

KATHLEEN

Joe.  It's Joe, isn't it?

JOE

And you're Kathleen.

VINCE

I can't believe you were talking to Joe

Fox.

KATHLEEN

Joe Fox?  As in --

KATHLEEN

Fox?  Your last name is Fox?

JOE

F-O-X.

KATHLEEN

God, I didn't realize.  I didn't know who

you --

(she trails off)

JOE

-- were with.

(quoting)

"I didn't know who you were with."

KATHLEEN

Excuse me?

JOE

It's from the Godfather.  When the movie

producer realizes that Tom Hagen is the

emissary of Vito Corleone --

(continued)

JOE (cont'd)

-- just before the horse's head ends up

in his bed never mind --

KATHLEEN

You were spying on me, weren't you?  You

probably rented those children.

JOE

Why would I spy on you?

KATHLEEN

I am your competition.  Which you know

perfectly well or you would not have put

up that sign saying "Just around the

Corner."

JOE

The entrance to our store is around the

corner.  There is no other way to say it.

It's not the name of our store, it's

where it is.  You don't own "around the

corner."

KATHLEEN

Next thing you'll be using twinkle

lights.

JOE

Twinkle lights?

KATHLEEN

Little white Christmas lights that

twinkle.  I use them in my window and on

all my displays, as if you didn't notice.

JOE

Look, the reason I came into your store

is that I was spending the day with

Annabel and Matt.  I like to buy them a

present when I see them because I'm one

of those guys who likes to buy his way

into the hearts of children who are his

relatives.  There was only one place to

buy children's books in the neighborhood

-- although that will not always be the

case, and it was yours, and it is a

charming little bookstore.  You probably

sell $250,000 worth of book a year --

KATHLEEN

How do you know that?

JOE

I'm in the book business.

KATHLEEN

I'm

JOE

Oh, I see, and we're the Price Club.

Only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive

oil for $3.99 that won't even fit into

your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap

books.  Me a spy.

(beat)

Absolutely.  And I managed to get my hands

on a secret printout of the sales figures

of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet

full of its own virtue that I was instantly

compelled to rush over and check it out

for fear it would drive me out of business

--

JOE (cont'd)

What?

(off her look)

What?

FRANK

Hi.  I'm Frank Navasky --

JOE

-- Joe Fox.

FRANK

Joe Fox?  Inventor of the Superstore,

enemy of the mid-list novel, destroyer of

City Books -- tell me something:

How do you sleep at night?

PATRICIA

I use a wonderful over-the-counter drug,

Ultrasom.  Don't take the whole thing,

just half, and you will wake up without

even that tiniest hangover.  You're Frank

Navasky, aren't you?

FRANK

Yes.

PATRICIA

Your last piece in the Independent, the

one about Anthony Powell, was brilliant.

I'm Patricia Eden, Eden Books.  Joe, this

man is the greatest living expert on

Julius and Ethel Rosenberg --

JOE

And this is Kathleen Kelly --

FRANK

You liked my piece.  God, I'm flattered.

You know you write these things and you

think someone's going to mention them and

then the whole week goes by and the phone

doesn't ring, and you think Oh, God, I'm

a fraud, a failure --

PATRICIA

You know what's always fascinated me

about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg is how

old they looked when they were really

just our age.

PATRICIA

(to Frank)

I'm so happy to have finally met you.  We

will talk.  Have you ever thought about

doing a book?

FRANK

Oh sure, it's passed through my head.

Something really relevant for today like

the Luddite movement in 19th century

England.

JOE

Patricia --

KATHLEEN

Frank --

FRANK

I really like Patricia Eden.  She's a

very nice person.

FRANK

She needs educating, that's all.

FRANK

She's hopelessly driven by money and

power, but there's a hope for anyone

who's that familiar with my work --

PATRICIA

I had no idea that Frank Navasky was so

down-to-earth.

PATRICIA

You read his stuff, you think he's going

to be so obscure and abstruse.

PATRICIA (cont'd)

He's always talking about Heidigger and

Foucault and I have no idea what any of

it's about, really.

PATRICIA (cont'd)

Where are you going?

JOE

I'm not really tired.

JOE (V.O.)

Do you ever feel you become the worst

version of yourself?  That a Pandora's

Box of all the secret hateful parts --

your arrogance, your spite, your

condescension -- has sprung open.

Someone provokes you, and instead of

just smiling and moving on, you zing

them.  Hello, it's Mr. Nasty.  I'm sure

you have no idea what I'm talking about.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I know what you mean and I'm completely

jealous.  What happens to me when I'm

provoked is that I get tongue-tied.  My

mind goes blank.  Then I spend all night

tossing and turning trying to think of

what I should have said.

JOE (V.O.)

Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could pass

all my zingers to you and then I would

never behave badly and you could behave

badly all the time and we'd both be

happy?  On the other hand, I must warn

you that when you finally have the

pleasure of saying the thing you mean to

say at the moment you mean to say it,

remorse inevitably follows.  Do you think

we should meet?

KATHLEEN

Meet?  Omigod.

JOE

No pickets, no demonstrations.

KEVIN

The neighborhood loves us.

NELSON

They're wondering where we've been all

these years.  They're wondering how they

ever did without it.

SCHUYLER

It's a hit.

NELSON

How's the children's book department?

JOE

It's early yet.  School isn't out.  And

there's that children's bookstore nearby

--

SCHUYLER

Cecilia's store --

JOE

Her daughter's --

NELSON

We'll crush it --

SCHUYLER

She was enchanting.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I don't think it's a good idea for us

to meet...

KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)

I love our relationship.  There's a lot

going on in the day-to-dayness of my life

and there's something magical...

KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)

... and thrilling about this island in

cyberspace I have with you.  SO PLEASE

DON'T ASK ME AGAIN.

BIRDIE

About $1200 less than the same week last

year.

KATHLEEN

That could be a fluke, right?

BIRDIE

Or not.

KATHLEEN

Their store is new.  It's a novelty.  But

it will all shake out.  Do you think I

should put up more twinkle lights?

BIRDIE

That's a lovely idea.

CHRISTINA

What if we have to fold?  I'll never find

another part time job and I won't be able

to pay the rent and I'll have to move to

Brooklyn.

GEORGE

The joy of rent control.  Six room for

$450 a month.

CHRISTINA

We know.  You've told us a million times.

I can't believe you're bringing it up at

a time like this.  It's like bragging

because you're tall.  Birdie never brags

about her rent and she pays even less

than you.

BIRDIE

Ten rooms.  I just rattle around from one

to the other.

KATHLEEN

Hey, guys.  We are not going to fold.

MEREDITH

George Pappas?

GEORGE

(I have died and gone to

heaven)

Yes.

MEREDITH

(flashing her badge)

Detective Carter, 23rd precinct.  I'd

like to ask you a few questions.

KATHLEEN

George?  Where are you going?

LAURA

Kathleen, are you surviving?

KATHLEEN

Laura!  We're so excited about your new

book.  When should we schedule your

signing?

LAURA

Oh, it's being published in January.

Are you going to be in business in

January?  I'm so worried.

KATHLEEN

We're doing great, aren't we?

CHRISTINA

Great.

BIRDIE

No difference whatsoever.

LAURA

Thank God.  Well, you know you can count

on me.  For anything, support, rallies.

Picket lines.  We can get the Times to

write something.  Or that nut in the

Independent --

KATHLEEN

What nut in the Independent?

LAURA

Frank Navasky.  This is just the sort of

thing that would outrage him.

MEREDITH

Mr. Pappas, I'm investigating the murder

of the woman found on the roof of your

building.  Do you live alone there?

GEORGE

Do I live alone?  Yes I do.  Do you live

alone?

MEREDITH

Yes.

MEREDITH

(overwhelmed)

What are you doing?

GEORGE

I don't know.  I have no idea.

MEREDITH

You have to stop.

GEORGE

I can't.

CASHIER

This is a Cash Only line.

KATHLEEN

What?

CASHIER

Cash Only.

KATHLEEN

Omigod, I only have a credit card.  Is

that okay?

PERSON BEHIND HER IN LINE

Of course it's not okay, there's a sign.

CASHIER

There's a sign.

PERSON IN LINE

(to the person behind her)

She doesn't have cash.

ANOTHER PERSON

Get on another line, lady.

JOE

Oh, hello.

KATHLEEN

Hello.

JOE

Do you need some money?

KATHLEEN

No, I don't need any money.  Thank you

very much.

CASHIER

Get on another line.

JOE

Hi.

(off her nametag, big smile)

Rose. Great name.  Rose, this is

Kathleen, I'm Joe, and this is a credit

card machine.  Happy Thanksgiving.

JOE (cont'd)

Now it's your turn to say happy

Thanksgiving back.

ROSE

Happy Thanksgiving back.

JOE

Mississippi is a hard word to spell.  How

do you spell it?  I-T.

(big smile)

Now take this credit card and put it

through the machine, zip zip.

JOE

So you're fine.

KATHLEEN

Fine.

JOE

Happy Thanksgiving.

ANNABEL

The sun'll come up tomorrow, bet your

bottom dollar that tomorrow, there'll be

sun --

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

This is such an odd Christmas.  I find

myself missing my mother, who's been dead

for ten years.  New York at Christmas is

so loaded with all the things we used to

do --

KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)

-- going to the Nutcracker --

KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)

-- ice skating at Rockefeller Center,

where I was knocked into a 6-year-old

maniac --

YOUNG KATHLEEN

Hey, watch out --

SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY

Me watch out, why don't you watch out?

I'm not sliding around like a baby.  You

think I come here to skate with babies?

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

My first experience as a speechless

person.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I always miss my mother at Christmas, but

somehow it's worse this year since I need

some advice from her.

JOE (V.O.)

My mother took me ice skating too --

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

-- although my mother did not skate.  The

nanny skated --

JOE (V.O.)

And I was

in

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

So was my nanny.

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

Different nanny.  By the way, I'm

surprised you aren't a writer.  Although

you probably

are

know it.  Are you a writer and

I

know it?

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

My mother died when I was ten.  I was

staying with my father, who is not famous

for intimacy, and whose way of breaking

the news of her death was to tell me she

would not be coming to pick me up as

usual.  It was a car accident, and I

don't know where she was going or who she

was with, and I assume what I owe her is

my tendency to cover almost any emotion

with a joke.  A useful gift, unless you

want to know what you're feeling.  She

was very beautiful.  People toss that

word around a lot, but my mother was.

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

Ancient history.  So what kind of advice

do you need?  Can I help?

JOE (V.O.)

I had a gut feeling you would be on line

now.

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

I can give you advice.  I'm great at

advice.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I don't think you can help.

JOE (V.O.)

Is it about love?

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

My business is in trouble.  My mother

would have something wise to say.

JOE (V.O.)

I'm a brilliant businessman.  It's what

I do best.  What's your business?

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

No specifics, remember?

JOE (V.O.)

Minus specifics, it's hard to help.

Except to say, go to the mattresses.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

What?

JOE (V.O.)

It's from The Godfather.  It means you

have to go to war.

KATHLEEN

(to herself)

The Godfather?

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

What is it with men and The Godfather?

JOE (V.O.)

The Godfather is the I Ching.  The

Godfather is the sum of all wisdom.  The

Godfather is the answer to any question.

What should I pack for my summer

vacation?  "Leave the gun, take the

cannoli."  What day of the week is it?

"Maunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday."

And the answer to your question is "Go to

the mattresses."

(continued)

JOE (cont'd)

You're at war.  "It's not personal, it's

business.  It's not personal it's

business."  Recite that to yourself every

time you feel you're losing your nerve.

I know you worry about being brave, this

is your chance.  Fight.  Fight to the

death.

PATRICIA

Look what I bought.

PATRICIA

I was just passing this store on Columbus

Avenue and it caught my eye.

JOE

What is it?

PATRICIA

A Menorah.

JOE

It doesn't look like a Menorah.

PATRICIA

I know.  I don't know what came over me.

I don't even celebrate Hanukkah.

KATHLEEN

Frank, I've decided to go to the

mattresses.  Do you think it would be a

gigantic conflict of interest if you

wrote something about us?

BIRDIE

(reading)

"Kathleen Kelly and her mother Cecilia

Kelly have raised your children.  If this

precious resource is killed by the cold

cash cow of Foxbooks, it will not only be

the end of Western civilization as we

know it, but the end of something even

dearer: our neighborhood as we know it.

Save the Shop Around the Corner and you

will save your own soul."  Frank, that's

charming.

FRANK

You think it's a little over the top?

BIRDIE

Just say thank you.

FRANK

Thank you.

CHRISTINA

(calling to Kathleen)

Channel 2's outside.

KATHLEEN

In a second.

GEORGE

(from the other room)

The Village Voice is coming.

KATHLEEN

Omigod.

FRANK

(in shock)

It's him.

KATHLEEN

Who?

FRANK

God. It is God.

WILLIAM SPUNGEON

I'm William Spungeon.

KATHLEEN

I'm very pleased to meet you.  I'm

Kathleen Kelly.

SPUNGEON

I knew your mother.  Although she knew me

only as W.  That enormous bookstore is

obscene.

FRANK

I'm Frank Navasky.  I carry your picture

in my wallet.

KATHLEEN

We've organized pickets.  Channel 13 is

doing a special.

SPUNGEON

I'd be glad to talk to the press if it's

all right with you.  They've been trying

to interview me for years.

FRANK

The press?  I'm the press.

KATHLEEN

You'd allow that?  For me?  For the

store?  That's incredible.  Although you

wouldn't have to be photographed.  I

respect that.  If it's television, they

could just put one of those blurry dots

in front of your face.

SPUNGEON

No television.

CHRISTINA

(referring to the TV crew)

They're waiting for you --

FRANK

I know all your books.  Phaelox the

gnome, the little man who comes from

nowhere... and is going nowhere...

(quoting)

"Where did you come from?"  "Nowhere."

"Where are you going?"  "Nowhere."

SPUNGEON

Cool it.  I'm starting to break out in

hives.

(to Kathleen)

Here's my phone number.

KATHLEEN

I had no idea William Spugeon had a

phone.

SPUNGEON

Adios.

FRANK

This is historic.

(beat)

Do you realize what I've done?  By

writing that piece, do you realize?

I've brought William Spungeon in from

the cold. Holy shit.  I am completely

amazing.

TV REPORTER

Kathleen Kelly?

CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER

Are you ready, Miss Kelly?

KATHLEEN

Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER

What?

KATHLEEN

Never mind.  I'm ready.  Shoot.

CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER

We're here in front of the Shop Around

the Corner, the famous West Side

children's bookstore now on the verge of

having to close its doors because the big

bad wolf, Foxbooks, has opened only a few

hundred feet away, wooing customers with

its sharp discounts and designer coffee.

KATHLEEN

They have to have discounts and lattes,

because most of the people who work there

have never read a book.

JOE

She's not as nice as she seems on

television.

KEVIN

You've met her?

JOE

She's kind of a pill.

KEVIN

She's probably not as attractive as she

seems on television either.

JOE

No, she's beautiful.  But a pill.

KEVIN

So you don't feel bad about basically

destroying her livelihood not to mention

her legacy not to mention her raison

d'etre.

JOE

It's not personal --

KEVIN

It's business.

JOE

Right.  Exactly.

JOE

I sell cheap books.  Sue me.  I sell

cheap books, and as a result -- listen

to this, because it's really bad --

more people can buy books.

KEVIN

That's what you said?

JOE

(outraged)

That's not all I said.  I said -- I can't

believe those bastards -- I said we were

great, I said people can come and sit and

read for hours and no one bothers them, I

said we stock 150,000 titles, I showed

them the New York City section.  I said

we were a goddamn piazza where people

could mingle and mix and be.

KEVIN

A piazza?

JOE

I was eloquent.  Shit.  It's just

inevitable, isn't it?  People are going

to want to turn her into Joan of Arc --

KEVIN

-- and you into Attila the Hun.

JOE

Well it's not me personally, it's more

like it's the company --

KATHLEEN

(on the television)

And I have to say, I have met Joe Fox,

who owns Foxbooks, and I have heard him

compared his store to a Price Club and the

books in it to cans of olive oil.

KATHLEEN

My mother used to say to me that every

book you sell is a gift from the

heart...

SCHUYLER

Who is this Spungeon anyway?

JOE

He's a writer.

NELSON

Well, I've never heard of him.  And

neither has anyone else in this place.

SIDNEY-ANN

The New York Literary world was shocked

this week when William Spungeon, the most

famously reclusive author since J.D.

Salinger, announced that he was coming

out of hiding because of his loyalty to a

small children's bookstore on the West

Side of Manhattan.  Discussing this

tonight is a man I happen to think of as

one of this city's most underappreciated

assets, Frank Navasky.

FRANK

Thank you.

SIDNEY-ANN

This all happened because of you, didn't

it --

FRANK

Well, I knew William Spungeon loved

children's books so I wrote a provocative

column --

SIDNEY-ANN

Your specialty.

FRANK

And it kind of smoked him out.

FRANK ON TELEVISION

Technologically speaking, the world's

out of hand.  Take the VCR.  The whole

idea of a VCR is that it makes it possible

for you to tape what's on television

while you're out of the house.  But the

whole point of being out of the house is

so you can

miss

Radio.  Now there's a medium I can get

behind.

SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION

Well, we're on television... and you're

good at it.

FRANK ON TELEVISION

Thank you.

SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION

The bookstore.  Tell us about it.

FRANK ON TELEVISION

Are you planning to collect radios?

SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION

Do you think I should?

FRANK ON TELEVISION

The Shop Around the Corner is a true New

York treasure.

SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION

As are you.  I'd love to have you back.

FRANK ON TELEVISION

Any time.  Are we done?

SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION

Not at all.

FRANK ON TELEVISION

Because I just want to say that the only

show I do watch is yours.

KATHLEEN

(appalled)

Omigod.

FRANK

Hey, I was just being polite.  Okay, I

admit, I slobbered all over her.

GEORGE

And I can't decide whether to put

sausages into the meat sauce or just

chopped meat.  Last time I made it,

Detective Carter and I never even sat

down to dinner because --

(he makes some sort of hand

gesture indicating that sex

prevented them from dining)

and last night, I made margaritas in the

blender, and I took the ice cube and --

BIRDIE

Spare us.

KATHLEEN

Don't tell me.  Not the slightest

difference?

KATHLEEN (cont'd)

How could that be?  All this publicity

and not one bit of difference?

Oh Birdie, what am I going to do?  What

would Mom have done?

BIRDIE

Let's ask her.

BIRDIE

Cecilia, what should we do?

KATHLEEN

Birdie?

BIRDIE

Shhhh.

(after a beat, shrugs)

She has no idea, but she thinks the

window display is lovely.  Good night

dearie.

KATHLEEN

Oh my goodness, hello.  What are you

doing here.

SPUNGEON

Loitering.  Lurking.  Skulking.

Stalking.

SPUNGEON (cont'd)

You look very beautiful.

KATHLEEN

Thank you.  But I'm a wreck.

SPUNGEON

An eyelash.  It's gone.

KATHLEEN

Are you writing another book?

SPUNGEON

I'm in the home stretch.  I'll be done in

approximately six more years.

KATHLEEN

Should I discount?

SPUNGEON

It's about a man on a quest for knowledge

who meets a woman he cannot resist.

KATHLEEN

If I discount I have to fire someone

because I can't discount with this

overhead but whom could I fire?  I

couldn't fire anyone.

SPUNGEON

You have your mother's hair.  Thick,

wild, the color of Nebraska wheat.

KATHLEEN

What are you doing?  Let me go.

KATHLEEN

Stop it.  Are you crazy?

SPUNGEON

(calling after her)

If you change your mind, you can E-mail

me.  Hermit@AOL.com.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I need help.  Do you still want to meet

me?

JOE (V.O.)

"Where?  When?"

KATHLEEN

We're meeting in a public place.

CHRISTINA

Well don't go anywhere with him.  Don't

even go out to the street with him

afterwards.  Get a dial cab to just sit

there and wait for you.

GEORGE

Did you tell Frank?

KATHLEEN

There's nothing to tell.

CHRISTINA

But did you tell him?

KATHLEEN

He's away.  At the 32nd anniversary of

the Chicago Seven trial.

GEORGE

And he's gone to a place where there are

no phones.  Do you even know this guy's

name?

CHRISTINA

And you're going to meet him in a bar?

KATHLEEN

Not a bar.  That place on 83rd with the

cheesecake.

GEORGE

And he will wear a flower in his lapel,

and you will be carrying a copy of Anna

Karenina with a rose in it.

CHRISTINA

Oh God, no.

KATHLEEN

Not Anna Karenina.  Pride and Prejudice.

KEVIN

I suppose she's carrying a copy of a book

with a flower in it.

KEVIN

Not really.

JOE

Really.

KEVIN

Which Jane Austen is it?

JOE

Pride and Prejudice.

KEVIN

She could be a real dog.

JOE

I know.  Look, I'll just stay ten

minutes.  I'll say hello.  Drink a cup of

coffee and split.  I'm outta here.

JOE (cont'd)

Walk me there, okay?

JOE

What if she has a really high, squeaky

voice?  I hate that.  It reminds me of

those mice in Cinderella.

KEVIN

What mice in Cinderella?

JOE

Gus-gus and oh shit, I can't remember the

other one.  Why am I compelled to meet

her?  I'm just ruining a good thing.

KEVIN

You're taking it to the next level.  I

always do that.  I always take a

relationship to the next level, and if it

works okay I take it to the next level

after that, until I can finally get to

the level where it becomes absolutely

necessary for me to leave.

JOE

I'm not going to stay long anyway.  I

already said that, didn't I.  Christ.

I'm a total wreck.

JOE

Kevin, this woman is the most adorable

creature I have ever come in contact

with.  If she turns out to be even as

good-looking as a mailbox, I will be

crazy not to turn my life upside down

and marry her.

KEVIN

She could be a real dog.

JOE

(a total panic)

You go look.

KEVIN

Me?

JOE

Just go to the window and check her out.

KEVIN

You're pathetic.

JOE

See her?

KEVIN

There's a beautiful, whoa, a very

beautiful girl.

JOE

Yes.

KEVIN

But no book.  Let me see, let me see...

Wait a minute.  There's a book with a

flower, so it must be her.

JOE

What does he look like?

KEVIN

There's a waiter blocking, I can't see

her face.  He's serving her a cup of tea

and she's putting in three spoonfuls of

sugar --

JOE

Well, why shouldn't she?

KEVIN

No reason.  Unless she has hypoglycemia.

Oh, he's moving.

JOE

Can you see her?

KEVIN

Yes.

JOE

And? --

KEVIN

(clearly frustrated)

She's very pretty.

JOE

She is.  I knew she would be.  She had

to be.

KEVIN

She looks... I would say she has a little

of the coloring of that Kathleen Kelly

person.

JOE

Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore.

KEVIN

Why not?  You said you thought she was

attractive.

JOE

So what?  Who cares about Kathleen Kelly?

KEVIN

Well, if you don't like Kathleen Kelly,

I can tell you right now you ain't gonna

like this girl.

JOE

Why not?

KEVIN

Because it

is

JOE

Oh, God.

KEVIN

What are you going to do?

JOE

Nothing.

KEVIN

You're going to let her just wait there?

JOE

Yes.  Yes I am.  That's exactly what I'm

going to do.  Why not?

KEVIN

But she wrote the letters.

JOE

Good night, Kevin.  I'll see you

tomorrow.

MAN

Do you mind?

KATHLEEN

Oh, yes.  I'm expecting someone.

Please.

KATHLEEN

Oh!

JOE

Kathleen Kelly.  Hello.  What a

coincidence.  Mind if I sit down?

KATHLEEN

Yes I do.  I'm expecting someone.

JOE

Pride and Prejudice.

KATHLEEN

Do you mind?

JOE

I didn't know you were a Jane Austen

fan.  Not that it's a surprise.  I bet

you read it every year.  I bet you just

love Mr. Darcy, and that your sentimental

heart beats wildly at the thought that he

and whatever her name is are really,

honestly and truly going to end up

together.

KATHLEEN

Would you please leave?

KATHLEEN

Please?

JOE

I'll get up as soon as your friend comes.

Is he late?

KATHLEEN

The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is

Elizabeth Bennet and she's one of the

greatest, most complex characters ever

written, not that you would know.

JOE

As a matter of fact I've read it.

KATHLEEN

Well, good for you.

JOE

I think you'd discover a lot of things if

you really knew me.

KATHLEEN

If I really knew you, I know what I would

find -- instead of a brain, a cash

register, instead of a heart, a bottom

line.

JOE

What is it?

KATHLEEN

I just had a breakthrough, and I have to

thank you for it.  For the first time in

my life, when confronted with a horrible,

insensitive person I actually knew what I

wanted to say and I said it.

JOE

I think you have a gift for it.  It was a

splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.

KATHLEEN

Meanness?  Let me tell you --

JOE

Don't misunderstand me, I'm just paying

you a compliment.

KATHLEEN

Why are you doing this?

JOE

What have we have?  A red, no, crimson

rose, tucked into the pages.  Something

you read about in a book, no doubt.  One

of those books with a lady in a nightgown

on the cover about to throw herself off a

cliff.

KATHLEEN (cont'd)

Give it to me.

JOE

It's a joke to you, isn't it?

Everything's a joke to you.

KATHLEEN (cont'd)

Please leave.  I beg you.

JOE

You know what the handkerchief reminds

me of?  The first day I met you --

KATHLEEN

The first day you lied to me --

JOE

I didn't lie to you --

KATHLEEN

You did too --

JOE

I did not --

KATHLEEN

I thought all that Fox stuff was so

charming.  F-O-X.

JOE

I never lied about it --

KATHLEEN

"Joe.  Just call me Joe."  As if you were

one of those stupid 22-year-old girls

with no last name.  "Hi, I'm Kimberley."

"Hi, I'm Janice."  What's wrong with

them?  Don't they know you're supposed to

have last names?  It's like they're a

whole generation of cocktail waitresses.

JOE

I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --

KATHLEEN

That's not what I meant --

JOE

And when I said the thing about the Price

Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't

what I meant either --

KATHLEEN

Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire.  I

feel so sorry for you.

JOE

I am going to take a wild guess that this

isn't him, either.  Who is he, I wonder.

Not, I gather, the world's greatest

living expert on Julius and Ethel

Rosenberg, but someone else entirely.

Will you be you be mean to him too?  Will

you start out sweet as sugar candy and

then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt

from the blue, find that sharp little

tongue of yours?

KATHLEEN

No, I won't.  Because the man who's

coming here tonight is completely unlike

you.  The man who is coming here is kind

and funny -- he has the most wonderful

sense of humor --

JOE

But he's not here.

KATHLEEN

If he's not here, he has a reason,

because there is not a cruel or careless

bone in his body.  I can't expect you to

know anything about a person like that.

You've nothing but a suit.

JOE

That is my cue.  Good night.

PATRICIA (O.C.)

So I said to her, "If you think I will

even talk to you about paying that kind

of advance for an author whose last book

is being used as trivets all over the

world, you are completely crazy."

KEVIN

But underneath that disagreeable exterior

she could turn out to be --

JOE

A real bitch.  Let's not talk about it.

I'm going back to the office.  You must

have work to do.

KEVIN

Not really.  This place is humming like a

top.

CHRISTINA

What happened?

KATHLEEN

He never came.

CHRISTINA

He stood you up?

KATHLEEN

I think something happened, something

terrible and unexpected that made it

impossible for him --

GEORGE

What happened?

KATHLEEN

He wasn't able to make it.

GEORGE

He stood you up.

KATHLEEN

What could have happened?

(continued)

KATHLEEN (cont'd)

Why didn't he come?  Maybe he showed up,

took one look at me and left.

CHRISTINA

Not possible.

KATHLEEN

Maybe there was a subway accident.

CHRISTINA

Absolutely.

KATHLEEN

A train was trapped underground with him

inside.

CHRISTINA

And no phone.

KATHLEEN

Or an automobile accident.  Those cab

drivers are maniacs.

CHRISTINA

They hit something and you slam right

into that plastic partition.

KATHLEEN

His elbows could be in splints -- so he

can't really dial --

CHRISTINA

Or he could be in the hospital in one of

those semi-private room with like --

CHRISTINA & KATHLEEN

(together)

-- no phone.

KATHLEEN

(to George)

What?

KATHLEEN

What are you saying?

GEORGE

It could be.

GEORGE (cont'd)

He was arrested two blocks from the

cheesecake place.

CHRISTINA

Is there a picture?

CHRISTINA

So that explains it.

GEORGE

He was in jail.

CHRISTINA

And there

was

GEORGE

-- but he got only one call and he had to

use it to call his lawyer.

CHRISTINA

You are so lucky.

GEORGE

You could be dead.

KATHLEEN

Are you crazy?  This man couldn't

possibly be the rooftop killer.

CHRISTINA

Remember when you thought Frank might be

the Unabomber?

KATHLEEN

That was different.

CHRISTINA

How long did you sit there all alone?

KATHLEEN

Not that long.  Joe Fox came in --

CHRISTINA

Joe Fox!

KATHLEEN

I don't want to talk about it.

(closes her eyes)

Let's get to work.

KATHLEEN

There must be something to do.  There's

always something to do.

CHRISTINA

He stood her up.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I have been thinking about you.  Last

night I went to meet you and you weren't

there.  I wish I knew why.  I felt so

foolish.

(continued)

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

And as I waited, someone else showed up,

a man who has made my professional life a

misery, and an amazing thing happened --

I was able, for the first time in my

life, to say the exact thing I wanted to say

it.  And of course, afterwards, I felt

terrible.  Just as you said I would.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I was cruel, and I'm never cruel.  And

even though I can hardly believe what I

said mattered to this man -- to him, I'm

just a bug to be crushed -- but what if

it did?  No matter what he's done to me,

there's no excuse for my behavior.

Anyway, you are my dear friend, and I so

wanted to talk to you.  I hope you have a

good reason for not being there last

night, but if you don't, and if we never

really connect again, I just want to tell

you how much it has meant to me to know

you were there.

COMPUTER

Goodbye.

JOE (V.O.)

I am in Vancouver.

JOE (V.O.)

I was stuck in a meeting, which I

couldn't get out of it, and there was

no phone.

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

The electricity went out in the building

and we were trapped on the 18th floor and

the telephone system blew too.

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

Amazingly enough.

JOE

Fuck you.

JOE (V.O.)

Dear friend: I cannot tell you what

happened to me last night, but I beg you

from the bottom of my heart to forgive me

for not being there.

JOE (V.O.)

-- for what happened.  I feel terrible

that you found yourself in a situation

that caused you additional pain.  But I'm

absolutely sure that whatever you said

last night was provoked, even deserved.

And everyone says things they regret when

they're worried or stressed.  You were

expecting to see someone you trusted and

met the enemy instead.  The fault is

mine.

(continued)

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

Someday I'll explain everything.

Meanwhile, I'm still here.  Talk to me.

CHRISTINA

Did he say anything about meeting again?

KATHLEEN

Not really.  It doesn't matter.  We'll

just be like George Bernard Shaw and Mrs.

Patrick Campbell and write letters our

whole lives --

CHRISTINA

Where was this taken, Birdie?

BIRDIE

Seville.

KATHLEEN

When you had the thunderbolt?

BIRDIE

Yes.  What did you decide, dearie?

KATHLEEN

Close.  We're going to close.

CHRISTINA

Close.

KATHLEEN

Although it feels like such a failure.

It feels like I'm quitting.  It feels

like... Mom...

BIRDIE

Keeping the store open doesn't keep your

mother alive, although sometimes I think

we all think it does.

CHRISTINA

Who was it, Birdie?  That you had the

thunderbolt over?

CHRISTINA (cont'd)

It's so romantic.

BIRDIE

But it wasn't meant to be.

CHRISTINA

Why not?

BIRDIE

He ran Spain.

CHRISTINA

Spain?

BIRDIE

The country.  He ran it.  That was his

job.  And then he died.  Just as well.

FRANK

She fell in love with Generalissimo

Franco?

KATHLEEN

Don't say that.  We don't know that for

sure.

FRANK

Who else could it have been?  It was

probably around 1960 --

KATHLEEN

I mean, it's not like he was something

normal, like a socialist or an anarchist

or something --

FRANK

It happened in Spain.  People do really

stupid things in foreign countries.

KATHLEEN

Absolutely.  They buy leather jackets,

they go see Flamenco, they ride in

gondolas, they eat in restaurants where

guitarists sing Malaguena sola Rosa, but

they don't fall in love with fascist

dictators.

KATHLEEN

Birdie is a very kind person, she's

practically my surrogate mother.

FRANK

Well she's out of her mind.

KATHLEEN

She is not.

FRANK

I could never ever be with anyone who

doesn't take politics as seriously as I

do.

PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM

Do you mind?

FRANK

A hot dog is singing.  You need quiet

while a hot dog is singing?

KATHLEEN

I have something to tell you.  I didn't

vote.

FRANK

What?

KATHLEEN

In the last mayoral election, when Rudy

Giuliani was running against Ruth

Messinger, I went to get a manicure and

forgot to vote.

FRANK

Since when do you get manicures?

KATHLEEN

Oh, I suppose you could never be with a

woman who gets manicures.

FRANK

Forget it.  It's okay.  I forgive you.

PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM

Shhhhhh.

KATHLEEN

You forgive me.

FRANK

What's going on?

FRANK (cont'd)

Hey.  What is it?

FRANK

Look, this has been a big week, you're

closing the store --

KATHLEEN

It's not that, Frank, really it's not.

It's just... Frank...

FRANK

I know, that was terrible of me.

KATHLEEN

What was?

FRANK

To jump all over you when I'm the one

who's really...  Oh, God, I don't know

how to say this --

KATHLEEN

What is it?

FRANK

You're a wonderful person, Kathleen.

KATHLEEN

So are you.

FRANK

And I'm honored that you want to be with

me because you would never be with anyone

who wasn't truly worthy --

KATHLEEN

I feel exactly the same way about you.

FRANK

Oh, God, don't say that, please, that

just makes it worse.

KATHLEEN

What?

(he shakes his head)

You don't love me?

KATHLEEN

Me either.

FRANK

You don't love me?

FRANK

But we're so right for each other.

KATHLEEN

I know.

KATHLEEN

That woman on television, right?

Sidney-Ann.

FRANK

I mean, nothing's happened or anything.

KATHLEEN

I think she's a Republican.

FRANK

I can't help myself.

FRANK (cont'd)

What about you?  Is there someone else?

KATHLEEN

Oh, somewhere out there, I'm sure.

Somewhere --

(she throws up her hands)

In cyberspace.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

My store is closing this week.

I own a store.  Did I ever tell you that?

Probably not.  It's a lovely store --

WOMAN SHOPPER

This is a tragedy.

(yelling across the shop to her

husband)

Honey, grab a copy of The Trumpet of the

Swan.

KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)

-- and in a week, it will be something

really depressing, like a Baby Gap.  I

am being amazingly brave --

WOMAN SHOPPER

What are you going to do with yourself?

KATHLEEN

I don't know.  I'm going to take some

time.  I have a little money saved.  I'm

almost looking forward to it --

KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)

I am so cheerful I would make Pollyanna

throw up.

SECOND SHOPPER

I came here every Saturday when I was a

little girl.  I remember when your mother

gave me Anne of Green Gables.  "Read it

with a box of Kleenex," that's what she

told me.

THIRD SHOPPER

She's looking down on you right now.

KATHLEEN

I'm sure she is.

KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)

I have promised myself I'm not going

to cry.

FOURTH SHOPPER

We should bomb Foxbooks.

KATHLEEN

It's not their fault.  The truth is, the

world is just... different.

KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)

Soon we'll just be a memory.  In fact,

someone, some foolish person will

probably think it's a tribute to this

city, the way it keeps changing on you,

the way you can never count on it, or

something.  I know, because that's the

sort of thing I'm always saying.  But the

truth is, I'm heartbroken.  I feel as if

part of me has died,  and my mother has

died all over again, and no one can ever

make it right.

WOMAN SHOPPER

Do you have the "Shoe" books?

SALESPERSON

The "Shoe" books?  Who's the author?

WOMAN SHOPPER

I don't know.  My friend told me my

daughter has to read the "Shoe" books,

so here I am.

KATHLEEN

Noel Streatfeild.  Noel Streatfeild wrote

Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes and

Theater Shoes and Movie Shoes...

(she starts crying as she tells

her)

I'd start with Skating Shoes, it's my

favorite, although Ballet Shoes is

completely wonderful.

SALESPERSON

Streatfeild.  How do you spell that?

KATHLEEN

S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-I-L-D.

WOMAN SHOPPER

Thank you.

KATHLEEN

(to herself)

They know nothing, they know absolutely

nothing.

JOE (V.O.)

I'm sorry.

JOE

Asshole.

JOE (V.O.)

I'm sorry.  I don't know what to say.

Truly I don't.  And anything I do say

will sound trite.  I hope you feel

better.

PATRICIA (V.O.)

What I was thinking was she'd probably

make a great children's book either.

JOE (V.O.)

Why would you think that?

PATRICIA

She knows everything.  She has flawless

taste.  She's famous for it.

The salesmen swear by her.  If she likes

it, it sells.  Period.

JOE

So you're going to offer her a job?

PATRICIA

Why not?  What else has she got to do?

JOE

Now that she's destitute --

PATRICIA

Thanks to you.

JOE

Well, I can't imagine her working for

you.

PATRICIA

Why not?

JOE

She has a horrible personality, she's...

nice to everyone all the time.  It's

exhausting.  And her staff turnover is

... non-existent.  They've been there

forever.  Until... recently, when they

all found out they were going to lose

their jobs.

PATRICIA

Thanks to you.

PATRICIA (cont'd)

Hold the elevator!

JOE

Hello, Charlie, Veronica.

PATRICIA

Last time, we rode in an elevator, we

made the deal of the century.  What is

going to happen this time?

CHARLIE

Miss Grant's going to get me a part in

one of her movies, that's what's going

to happen.

VERONICA

In your dream, Charlie.

PATRICIA

(back to the conversation with

Joe)

I love how you've totally forgotten you

had any role in her current situation.

It's so obtuse.  It reminds me of someone

... Who?  Who does it remind me of?

(thinks for a moment)

Me!

PATRICIA

Shit.

VERONICA

Shit.

JOE

It is stuck?

CHARLIE

Could be.

JOE

Charlie, what are you doing?

CHARLIE

Bang the door.

PATRICIA

Really.

CHARLIE

I hope this thing doesn't plummet to the

basement.

VERONICA

Can it do that?

JOE

No.

JOE

This is Joe Fox.  Who is this?  Hi, Juan.

We're stuck on the sixth floor.  There

are four of us --

PATRICIA

(grabs the phone)

-- and if you don't get your ass up here

in two shakes and get us out --

JOE

(to Veronica)

Are you all right?

VERONICA

It's hot.

CHARLIE

Everyone should jump in the air.

PATRICIA

What?

CHARLIE

We jump.  The elevator thinks that no one

is here and it opens.

JOE

One -- two -- three --

VERONICA

If I ever get out of here, I'm going to

start speaking to my mother.  She slept

with Oscar, and maybe it was Oscar's

fault, I don't know, and then she sold

the story to Inside Edition.

That could have been Oscar's idea, too.

Who knows?  But I divorced him.  I wonder

what she's doing right this minute.  I

think of her... whenever I hear about a

new pill.  Ecstasy, Zoloft, Fenphen, I

just think, I hope Mama knows about that.

PATRICIA

Maybe you can make up on Rosie.  That

would be so great for the book.

CHARLIE

(trying to figure it out)

If I ever get out of here...

PATRICIA

If I ever get out of here, I'm having my

eyes lasered.

CHARLIE

I'm marrying Oreet.  I love her.  I

should marry her.  I don't know what's

been stopping me.

JOE

If I ever get out of here, I'm going to --

PATRICIA

Where is my TicTacs?

(looks at Joe)

What?

JOE (V.O.)

I came home tonight and got into the

elevator to go to my apartment.  An hour

later, I got out of the elevator and

Brinkley and I moved out.  Suddenly

everything had become clear.

(continued)

JOE (V.O., cont'd)

It's a long story.  Full of the personal

details we avoid so carefully...

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I wonder whether change isn't a kind of

infection.  You start with one thing --

something you never ever thought would

change and it does --

(continued)

KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)

and the next thing you know even your bed

is in a different place.

(continued)

KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)

Six months ago, when you and I first met,

I knew everything about myself -- what I

would be doing for the rest of my life

and even the person I would be doing it

with.  Now I know nothing.

GEORGE

Then, in the 19th century, Caldecott

revolutionized the publishing of

children's books by the introduction of

color illustrations --

JOE

What about going to the Children's Zoo?

ANNABEL

I don't want to go to the Children's Zoo.

JOE

Okay.  The Staten Island Ferry.

ANNABEL

I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

MATT

I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

JOE

Well we can't go to the Storybook Lady.

JOE

I'll

ANNABEL

Where did she go?

JOE

She had to close her store.

ANNABEL

Why?

JOE

She didn't have enough business.

ANNABEL

Why?

JOE

Well.  Her store was very close to our

store, and you know our store sells books

at a slightly lower cost --

ANNABEL

Why?

JOE

Why do we sell at a lower cost?  So more

people can buy books.

ANNABEL

Why couldn't she sell that way too?

JOE

Because she's small and we're big.  How

about we go get some candy?

ANNABEL

So now she's gone and it's all your

fault.

JOE

It's business, Annabel.  It's not

personal.  How about we go get so much

candy you'll be bouncing off the walls

for days?

MATT

What's personal?

ANNABEL

Personal means that she's gone forever,

and now we'll never get another book from

her as long as we ever live.

JOE

Remember the man who worked with her?

ANNABEL

(a wail)

No.

JOE

Well I hired him.

ANNABEL

You killed the Storybook Lady.

JOE (V.O.)

Why haven't you written?

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I have a cold.

JOE (V.O.)

How's your cold?

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

My ears are blocked, my nose is clogged.

JOE (V.O.)

Are you feeling any better?

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I'm lying in bed listening to Joni

Mitchell and drinking cranberry juice

which I am sorry to say is the exact same

color as my nose.  I keep thinking about

my future.  What future?  What am I

going to do?

JOE

What are you doing here?

NELSON

To us.

JOE

Father and son, together at last.  That

happened with Gillian?

NELSON

I've stayed here after, let's see, your

mother, Laurette that ballet dancer --

JOE

-- the nanny --

NELSON

Was she the nanny?  I forgot that.  How

ironic.  Then there was the ice skater --

JOE

-- also the nanny --

NELSON

Really.  How amazingly ironic.  Sybil the

astrologer.

JOE

Whose moon turned out to be in somebody

else's house, as I recall.

NELSON

Just like Gillian.

JOE

Gillian ran off with someone?

NELSON

The nanny.

JOE

Nanny Maureen?  Gillian ran off with

Nanny Maureen?  That's incredibly

ironic.

NELSON

True true.

JOE

There's no other word for it.

NELSON

Who did you break up with?

JOE

Patricia.  You met her.

NELSON

Would I like her?

(cracks himself up)

Just kidding.  Isn't this great?  Have

some peanuts.  Of course I have to live

out of a suitcase for a least three

weeks, and then there's the inevitable

legal hassle, more of your inheritance

down the drain.

JOE

Don't worry about it.

NELSON

I won't.  But then I get to meet someone

new.  That's the easy part.

JOE

Oh, right, a snap to find the one single

person in the world who fills your heart

with joy.

NELSON

Don't be ridiculous.  Have I ever been

with anyone who fits that description?

Have you?

JOE

On to the next.

NELSON

Isn't it a beautiful night?

KATHLEEN

(voice clogged, through

intercom)

Who is it?

JOE

Joe Fox.

KATHLEEN

What are you doing here?

JOE

May I please come up?

KATHLEEN

It's really not a good idea.

KATHLEEN

(into the intercom)

I have a terrible cold, can you hear it?

I'm sniffling and not really awake --

KATHLEEN'S VOICE

and I'm sleeping practically twenty-four

hours a day, and taking echinacea --

KATHLEEN

(into intercom)

-- and vitamin C, so I would really

appreciate it if you would come some

other time --

JOE

Kathleen?

KATHLEEN

Just a second.

JOE

Hello.

KATHLEEN

What are you doing here?

JOE

I heard you were sick and I was worried

and I wanted to --

(he hears voices)

Is someone here?

KATHLEEN

Just the Home Shopping Network.

JOE

Bought any porcelain dolls?

KATHLEEN

I was thinking about it.

(beat)

You put me out of business --

JOE

I know that --

KATHLEEN

And now you turn up with flowers?  Did

you come to gloat?

JOE

No.

KATHLEEN

To offer me a job --

JOE

No, I wouldn't think of --

KATHLEEN

Because I have plans, I have lots of

offers.  I've been offered a job by --

well, actually by --

JOE

My former?

KATHLEEN

Former?

JOE

We broke up.

KATHLEEN

That's too bad.  You seemed so perfect

for each other.

(she claps her hand over her

mouth)

I don't mean to say things like that.  No

matter what you have done to me, there is

no excuse for my saying anything like

that.  But every time I see you --

JOE

Things like that just seem to fly out of

your mouth.

KATHLEEN

Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm starting over.

(sharply)

Thank you for coming.  Goodbye.

(she says it again, a little

more nicely)

Thank you for coming. Goodbye.

JOE

I bought you flowers.

KATHLEEN

Oh.

(trying as hard as she can)

Thank you.

JOE

Why don't I put them in water?

JOE

You're sick.  Sit down, please.

JOE

Vase?

KATHLEEN

Upper left.

JOE

George says hello.  He told me you

weren't feeling well.

KATHLEEN

How is George?

JOE

Great.  He's revolutionizing the place.

No one is allowed to work in his

department who doesn't have a Ph.D. in

children's literature.

KATHLEEN

I love daisies.

JOE

You told me.

KATHLEEN

They're so friendly.  Don't you think

they are the friendliest flower?

JOE

I do.

KATHLEEN

When did you break up?

JOE

Oh, a couple of weeks ago.

KATHLEEN

Everyone is breaking up.  You.  Me.  This

other person I know broke up with someone

in an elevator.  I think it was in an

elevator.  Or just outside it.  Or after

it.  It got stuck.  I think.  And suddenly

everything became clear.  When I saw you,

at the coffee place, I was waiting for him

and I was --

JOE

-- charming.

KATHLEEN

I was not charming.

JOE

Well, you

looked

JOE

Tea?

KATHLEEN

Upper right.

KATHLEEN

I was upset.  And I was horrible.

JOE

Honey?

JOE

I

KATHLEEN

True.  But

I

JOE

Whereas I am a horrible person and have

no choice but to be horrible, is that

what you're saying?

KATHLEEN

No I am not saying that because I am done

saying horrible things, even to you.

JOE

You did it again.

JOE

I put you out of business.  You're

entitled to hate me.

KATHLEEN

I don't hate you --

JOE

But you'll never forgive me.  Like

Elizabeth.

KATHLEEN

Who?

JOE

Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice.

She was too proud --

KATHLEEN

I thought you hated Pride and Prejudice.

JOE

-- or was she too prejudiced and Mr.

Darcy too proud?  I can never remember.

(beat)

It wasn't personal --

KATHLEEN

-- It was business.  What is that

supposed to mean?  I am so sick of that.

All it means is it's not personal to you,

but it's personal to me, it's personal to

a lot of people.

(she shrugs helplessly)

What's wrong with personal anyway?

JOE

Nothing.

KATHLEEN

I mean, whatever else anything is, it

ought to begin by being personal.

KATHLEEN

My head's starting to get funny.  I have

to go back to bed.

KATHLEEN

Why did you stop by?  I forget.

JOE

I wanted to be your friend.

KATHLEEN

Oh.

JOE

I knew it wasn't possible.  What can I

say?  Sometimes a person just wants the

impossible.  Could I ask you something?

KATHLEEN

What?

JOE

What happened with that guy at the cafe?

KATHLEEN

Nothing.

JOE

But you're crazy about him --

KATHLEEN

Yes.  I am.

JOE

Then why don't you run off with him?

What are you waiting for?

KATHLEEN

I don't actually know him.

JOE

Really.

KATHLEEN

We only know each other -- oh God, you're

not going to believe this --

JOE

Let me guess.  From the Internet.

KATHLEEN

Yes.

JOE

You've Got Mail.

KATHLEEN

Yes.

JOE

Very powerful words.

KATHLEEN

Yes.

JOE

I'm happy for him.  Although -- could I

make a little suggestion?  I think you

should meet him.  No.  I take it back.

Why meet him?

KATHLEEN

(starting to get sharp again)

I hardly think I need advice from someone

who --

JOE

I concede I bring out the worst in you,

but let me help you not to say something

you'll just torture yourself about for

years to come.

JOE

I hope you're better soon.  It would be

a shame to miss New York in the spring.

KATHLEEN

Thank you for the daisies.

JOE

Take care.

KATHLEEN

I will.

JOE

Goodbye.

KATHLEEN

Goodbye.

MALE RUNNER

Hi.

CHRISTINA

Hi.

RABBIT

Shabbat shalom!

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I have been thinking about this and

I think we should meet.

JOE (V.O.)

We should meet.  And we will meet.  But

I'm in the middle of a project that

needs...

(he pauses to think of the

right word)

... tweaking.

JOE

Tweaking?

KATHLEEN

That's what he said.

JOE

He's probably married.

KATHLEEN

That's a terrible thing to say.  It's not

possible.

JOE

Have you asked him if he's married?  Have

you said, "Are you married?"

KATHLEEN

No.

KATHLEEN (V.O.)

I know this is probably a little late to

be asking, but are you married?

JOE (V.O.)

Am I married?  What kind of a question is

that?  How can you ask me that?  Don't

you know me at all?  Oh wait, I get it.

Your friends are telling you the reason

we haven't met is that I'm married.  Am I

right?

JOE

So he didn't exactly answer.

KATHLEEN

He did too.  He nailed me.  He knew

exactly what I was up to.  Which is just

like him.

JOE

But he didn't exactly answer, did he?

Did he?

KATHLEEN

No.

JOE

Maybe he's fat.

KATHLEEN

I don't care about that.

JOE

You don't care that he might be one of

those guys who's so fat he has to be

removed from his house with a crane?

KATHLEEN

That's very unlikely.

JOE

Why else do you think he's putting off

meeting you?  Although... maybe that's

not it.  Maybe...

KATHLEEN

What?

JOE

Never mind.

KATHLEEN

What????

JOE

He could be waiting til he's paroled.

KATHLEEN

Oh, you won't believe this, there was a

moment when George thought he might be

the rooftop killer, which was completely

ridiculous --

JOE

What's his handle?

JOE

Come on, I'm not going to write him.  Is

that what you think?

KATHLEEN

NY 152.

JOE

One five two.  One hundred fifty two.

Very interesting.  He's 152 years old.

He has 152 hairs remaining on his head.

He's had 152 moles removed and now he

has 152 pockmarks.

JOE

His combined college board scores.

KATHLEEN

His IQ.

JOE

The number of women he's slept with.

KATHLEEN

The number of times he's seen The

Godfather.

JOE

That's the first good thing I've heard

about him.

KATHLEEN

His address.  No, no, no.  He would never

do anything that prosaic.

KATHLEEN (cont'd)

The only thing I really care about

besides the married thing... and the

jail thing... is the boat thing.

JOE

The boat thing?

KATHLEEN

I could never be with anyone who has

a boat.

JOE

Oh.

KATHLEEN

So that clinches it.  We'll never be

together.  I'll take care of these.

JOE (cont'd)

I could never be with anyone who likes

Joni Mitchell.

(singing, imitating Joni)

"It's cloud's illusions I recall, I

really don't know clouds at all."

What does that mean?

JOE

How's your book coming?

KATHLEEN

There's a children's book editor I know,

from the store, and she's excited to

read it.  When I finish it.  Who would

ever have thought I'd write?  I mean,

if I didn't have all this free time, I

would never have discovered --

KATHLEEN (cont'd)

The truth is, he was the one who made me

start thinking about writing --

JOE

Mister 152 Felony Indictments --

KATHLEEN

Mister 152... insights into my soul.

JOE

Yes.  Well.  Can't compete with that.

KATHLEEN

Well.  I keep bumping into you.  Hope

your mango's ripe.

JOE

I think it is.  Want to bump into me

Saturday?  Around lunchtime?

JOE (V.O.)

How about meeting Saturday?  The first

day of spring.  4 P.M.  There's a place

in Riverside Park at 88th Street where

the path curves and when you come around

the curve, you'll find me waiting.

JOE

Today?

KATHLEEN

Today.

JOE

Whoa.

KATHLEEN

I know.  In Riverside Park.

JOE

Isn't that amazing?  Maybe I've seen him,

and I don't even know it.

JOE

He could be the Zipper Man.

KATHLEEN

Who's that?

JOE

This guy on Amsterdam who repairs

zippers.  You'll never have to buy new

luggage.

KATHLEEN

Stop teasing.

JOE

Timing is everything.  He waited until

you were primed.  Until you knew there

was no other man you could ever love.

KATHLEEN

(almost believe it)

Yes.

JOE

Sometimes I wonder...

KATHLEEN

What?

JOE

If I hadn't been Foxbooks and you hadn't

been The Shop Around the Corner and we'd

just met --

KATHLEEN

Don't.

JOE

I would have asked for your phone number

and I wouldn't have been able to wait 24

hours before calling and asking, "How

about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie,

for as long as we both shall live?"

KATHLEEN

(almost a swoon)

Joe...

JOE

And then we would never have been at war.

KATHLEEN

No.

JOE

The only fight we'd ever have is what

video to rent on Saturday night.

KATHLEEN

Who fights about that?

JOE

Some people.  Not us.

KATHLEEN

We would never.

JOE

If only...

KATHLEEN

Please.  I have to go.

JOE

Let me ask you something?  How come

you'll forgive him for standing you

up and you won't forgive me for a

little tiny thing like putting you

out of business?

JOE

Oh how I wish you would.

KATHLEEN

I really do have to go.

JOE

You don't want to be late.

VOICE

Brinkley!  Brinkley!

JOE

Don't cry, Shopgirl, don't cry.

KATHLEEN

I wanted it to be you.  I wanted it to

be you so badly.

FADE OUT
