THE BACK-UP PLAN

ZOE (V.O.)

I can't believe I didn't get a

pedicure for this. How

embarrassing. Look at that...

ZOE (V.O.)(CONT'D)

What's wrong with me? If I were

with a real guy doing this, I

would've gotten a pedicure. And a

wax. I'm pathetic.

ZOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Fuck, that one's even worse. And

when did my toes get so fat? No

wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed

animal.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.

DR. HARRIS

What?

ZOE

My toes...sorry.

DR. HARRIS

I'm not looking at your toes.

ZOE

Right.   Duh.

DR. HARRIS

All done.

2.

ZOE

That's it?

DR. HARRIS

I'll elevate your legs for ten

minutes and then you're good to go.

ZOE

This is the first time I've heard

that ticking clock sound and it

doesn't freak me out.

DR. HARRIS

Good.   Just relax.

ZOE

I can't, I'm totally freaking out.

DR. HARRIS

Everything's going to be great. I

have a feeling you and...

(checks empty syringe)

Number CRM-101404 are going to make

beautiful babies together.

BOBBY (V.O.)

Number CRM-101404? Are you high?

BOBBY

Says here he has red hair and

freckles.

ZOE

And glasses, too.

BOBBY

And why are we picking him?

3.

ZOE

Because he's honest.

BOBBY

He's ugly.

ZOE

You think they're all telling the

truth? If they're so smart and

good looking, why are they beating

off into a cup?

BOBBY

Have you ever fucked a guy with red

hair and freckles?

ZOE

No, and I won't have to.

BOBBY

But what about your kid? No one's

going to want to fuck your kid.

(beat)

That came out wrong.

ZOE

Yeah...it's a good thing you're not

going to be the father.

BOBBY

What?    I can't be the father!

ZOE

Come on, we don't have to have sex.

BOBBY

Oh, Jesus, I didn't even think

about that. Rewind, rewind,

rewind...

ZOE

You're one of my best friends.

Don't you want to help me?

4.

BOBBY

Yeah, but...that's too much. I'll

walk your dog, tell you when you

look fat, be honest about your

eyebrows...

ZOE

Just a few sperm. Big deal. You

waste billions of them every night.

BOBBY

You know I flee at the slightest

chance of intimacy. Do you see

these bags under my eyes? Ricardo

slept over last night, and he

wanted to hold me. I actually had

to fake a seizure.

ZOE

Forget it.     Forget the whole thing.

MONA (V.O.)

Forget the whole thing.    It's just

a phase...

MONA

You don't want kids.    Trust me.

ZOE

Easy for you to say.    You have

four.

MONA

Yeah, and it's awful.

MONA (CONT'D)

They've ruined my life.

ZOE

Come on...

5.

MONA

Have you seen my vagina?

MONA (CONT'D)

Do you want to?

MONA (CONT'D)

I would do that for you. To prove

to you that you don't want to have

kids, I will show you my vagina.

ZOE

I don't want to see your vagina.    I

want a baby. My own baby.

MONA

Is it possible you're just a little

lonely? You know, you haven't met

the right guy and--

ZOE

It's not about a guy. I don't need

a guy. I don't even think I want a

guy at this point. I've dated a

hundred guys in the last five

years, and not one of them is even

close to being the one. How long

am I supposed to wait?

MONA

You never know. He could be right

around the corner.

ZOE

Well, then he's late. And I hate

people who are late. And what if

he's not right around the corner?

What if he's miles away?

ZOE (CONT'D)

I want to have a baby. And time is

running out. I hear a clock

ticking every time I close my eyes.

I need it to stop.

6.

ZOE

Ding.

ZOE (CONT'D)

How the fuck am I supposed to get

down from here?

DR. HARRIS

You don't have to walk like that.

ZOE

Oh.   Okay.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Should we hug? We might have just

made a baby together.

ZOE

Hi.

PREGNANT WOMEN

Hi.

7.

ZOE

Hi.

WOMAN

Hi.

WOMAN (CONT'D)

You're starting to freak me out.

ZOE

Sorry.

WOMAN

Stop it.

ZOE

Hi!

ZOE (CONT'D)

Taxi!

ZOE

Hallelujah!

8.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.

STAN

You own it?

ZOE

No, but I'm about to rent it.

STAN

Actually, if we're being technical,

you kind of stole it.

ZOE

I don't think so.

STAN

If you see someone about to get in

a cab, you can't just run in from

the other side and say it's yours.

ZOE

I didn't see you.

STAN

I saw you see me.

ZOE

(to the cabbie)

Sir, who saw you first?

STAN

Maybe you're not from around here,

but there's a code. It's like war,

even though it's brutal and bloody,

there are still certain rules we--

ZOE

Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out.

ZOE (CONT'D)

But not because you're right, but

because I am in a terrific mood,

and you are ruining it.

9.

STAN

No.   I'll get out.

ZOE

Now what?

STAN

I don't know. You tell me.

ZOE

What? Where's he going?!

(waving her hands, then)

Come back!

ZOE (CONT'D)

Well, that was stupid. Why'd you

get out, you, stupid-head?

STAN

You said you were in a great mood

and I was ruining it. I felt bad.

(then)

Did you just call me stupid-head?

ZOE

Oh, man...

STAN

How's your great mood now?

10.

STAN

How `bout now?

ZOE

Please stop talking to me.

STAN

So, why are you in such a good mood

anyway?

ZOE

Not that it's any of your business,

but...good things are happening to

me.

STAN

That's nice. I hope it continues.

ZOE

Thanks. Well, have a nice life.

Try not to steal any more cabs.

STAN

You do the same.

11.

ZOE

Hey, Nutsy. How's it going?

BOBBY

Oh, my God, you're glowing.

(to Jalisa)

She's glowing, right?

JALISA

Glowing.   Tell us everything.

BOBBY

Everything.

ZOE

There's not much to tell.

BOBBY

You just got shot up with a wad of

red-headed-freckle sperm. There's

something to tell.

JALISA

He had red hair and freckles?

BOBBY

I tried to talk her out of it.

JALISA

Why'd you do that, Mami?

BOBBY

(to Jalisa)

I know, right?

JALISA

Red pubes.     Eek...

ZOE

I'm never going to see his pubes!

BOBBY

You'll see your kid's pubes.

ZOE

I doubt it.

BOBBY

But you'll know they're there.

12.

ZOE

What is wrong with you?

JALISA

So, what happened?    Come on...

ZOE

I lay down, put my feet up, five

minutes later it was over. I

barely felt a thing.

BOBBY

Sounds like Ricardo.

JALISA

Tell me about it, Papi.

BOBBY

So...what happens now?

ZOE

Now, we wait.

BOBBY

That's no fun, I want to know if

I'm going to be a fairy godmother.

ZOE

We'll just have to wait and see.

BOBBY

Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can

have an O'Dhouls or something.

JALISA

We'll go to the piano bar and get

Bobby to sing some Ace of Base.

BOBBY

Forget it, she's not coming. I can

tell by the dull look on her face.

ZOE

Love you.

13.

BOBBY/JALISA

I saw the sign and it opened up my

eyes, I saw the sign...

STAN

Hi.

ZOE

Aahhh!

ZOE (CONT'D)

You scared the hell out of me!

STAN

Oh, wow.   Is he...okay?

ZOE

What are you doing here?

STAN

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare

you. Or hurt your dog. Don't

worry, I'm not a stalker.

ZOE

How'd you know I worked here?

STAN

I followed you after the subway.

(thinks, then)

That sounds a little stalkery, huh?

ZOE

Yeah.

STAN

I just really wanted to see you

again. Almost like I had to see

you again. Can I walk you home?

(then)

Is it me or does everything I say

make me sound more like a stalker?

14.

STAN (CONT'D)

Can I just give you my card? Here.

Take my card. I'm not a freak.

Really. I sell cheese.

ZOE

Cheese?

STAN

Yeah. My family has a goat farm.

We make cheese. You like cheese?

ZOE

I guess. I've never really thought

about it.

STAN

Little Goat. Maybe you've seen us

at the Farmer's market? Come by

sometime and you can taste my

cheese.

(then)

Okay, I'm going to go. This has

not gone as planned.

ZOE

Bye.

15.

CAROL

Everyone, please say hello to Zoe.

EVERYONE

Hi, Zoe.

CAROL

Welcome to Single Mother's By

Choice. As the name suggests, we

are all single mothers by choice.

Some of us have adopted, some

conceived with a donor, every story

is different, but with the same

common denominator. We wanted to

have a child, and we didn't need a

partner to make it happen.

LORI

Are you a doer or a tryer?

ZOE

Excuse me?

LORI

Are you already a single mother or

are you trying to become one?

ZOE

Oh, I guess I'm trying. I was just

inseminated a few days ago.

(then)

Inseminated...makes me feel like a

cow or something.

CAROL

Well, when we don't have partners

with penises, we do what we've got

to do, right?

(then)

So, tell us a little bit about

yourself.

16.

ZOE

Okay. Let's see...um, I own a pet

store on Hudson Street. Dogs,

cats, rabbits...no birds, they

creep me out. Before that, I

worked for Google, which I

completely hated. One day, I

decided life was too short, and,

against my accountant's advice, I

quit Google, cashed out and bought

the pet store. Now I'm really

happy on the work front, but I

still haven't found, you know, the

one.

CAROL

Ah, yes.   The elusive "one."

ZOE

I always imagined I'd be married

with kids by now, but it doesn't

look like it's going to happen that

way. So, time for Plan B.

CAROL

Society tells us we're supposed to

find that special person to make us

happy and complete. But guess

what...you have to create your own

happiness. You don't need someone

to complete you, some...man. You

already are complete.

LORI

Amen, sister.

CAROL

If you want to have a baby, we here

at Single Mothers By Choice can be

your partners. We will be your

emotional rocks.

CAROL (CONT'D)

From inception to college

graduation and everything in

between. We're here for each

other.

17.

SARA

Dakota was actually born right here

in this very room. Right where

you're sitting, actually.

ZOE

(uncomfortable)

Really? Right here?      Imagine that.

SARA

Best day of my life.

ZOE

And how old is she now?

DAKOTA

I'm three.

MONA

Why did you join a support group of

unattractive, militant lesbians

when you have me?

ZOE

Because you're really not that

supportive.

MONA

Sure I am.

ZOE

You just told me that if I breast-

feed "my girls" will end up looking

like empty tube socks.

MONA

I'm just being honest. And don't

even get me started on what

childbirth does to your bladder.

ZOE

What does it do to your bladder?

18.

MONA

I just peed a little bit.

ZOE

I don't think I'm pregnant. The

doctor says it will probably take

several tries. Something about

frozen sperm being lazy.

MONA

Good.   Take your time.

ZOE

So, should I call this guy?   Do you

think that would be weird?

MONA

Do I think it's weird that you're

pursuing someone at the exact

moment in time that you might be

most unavailable? No. Because

that's what you do. You sabotage.

ZOE

(ignoring her)

He works at the Farmer's market.

And it's right around the corner.

Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

MONA

I look fat and old?

ZOE

No.

MONA

Then, no.

ZOE

Let's go spy on him. Come on. It

will be fun. Like high school.

MONA

I can't.

(checks watch)

This twenty minute breakfast

concludes my "me" time for the

week. More proof that you should

not have kids.

19.

ZOE

Oh, well.

OLIVIA

Can I help you?

ZOE

(distracted)

No, I'm fine.

OLIVIA

Tasty, huh?

OLIVIA (CONT'D)

All ripe and juicy. And firm, too.

Bet you could just eat him up in

one bite, right?

ZOE

What?

OLIVIA

And don't look now, but he's coming

this way.

20.

STAN

A-ha! I didn't scare you away

after all.

ZOE

(trying to be casual)

I was just in the neighborhood. I

thought I'd come by and get some

blueberries. I'm going to make a

pie.

STAN

I love blueberry pie.

ZOE

I'm confused. I thought you made

cheese or something.

STAN

What makes you think I don't?

ZOE

I don't know, you're over there

playing the banjo.

STAN

Can't someone do both?

ZOE

Honestly, I didn't know anyone did

either.

OLIVIA

Aren't you going to introduce me to

your new friend?

STAN

Nope.

(to Zoe)

Come on. Let me show you around.

21.

STAN

This is our basic chevre, probably

our best seller. The cheese that

started it all, as they say. Then

over here we have our surface-

ripened cheeses. These are the

aged/raw milk cheeses.

(realizing)

This is really boring, huh?

ZOE

No, not at all.

STAN

It's like you're in a foreign

country and the only thing to watch

on tv is a documentary on cheese.

You don't want to watch it, but

somehow you can't stop...

ZOE

(laughing)

I think it's interesting.    Really.

STAN

All right, you asked for it...

(boring voice)

The aged/raw milk cheeses are made

from raw milk and then aged for

four to six months. Sometimes

more. Sometimes less. Usually

more. Depends on the cheese.

FRED

Stop.   You're killing me.

STAN

Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.

(then)

She's the one I followed from the

subway the other day like a total

psychopath.

FRED

Right...I heard about you.

22.

ZOE

I don't know whether to be

flattered or terrified.

FRED

Be afraid.

STAN

Don't scare her away.   I'm trying

to redeem myself.

FRED

Then you should put down the banjo.

You look like a doofus.

STAN

Doofus?

(then, to Zoe)

Do you think I look like a doofus?

ZOE

I don't really know what a doofus

looks like.

STAN

Okay. If I put the banjo down, can

I take you to lunch or something?

ZOE

I should really get back to work.

STAN

Come on, say the word and we can

have a six-course tasting menu at

Union Square Cafe. I know the

chef.

ZOE

That sounds nice, but, I should

probably go.

STAN

Well, can I call you?

23.

BOBBY

JALISA

ZOE

JALISA

ZOE

BOBBY

ZOE

BOBBY

ZOE

(then)

BOBBY

ZOE

JALISA

ZOE

(then)

BOBBY

(MORE)

24.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

He'll be there with bells on.

(then)

He didn't say the "bells on" part.

I added that. Sounds a little too

gay, though, so I take it back.

STAN

We could have gone anywhere.

ZOE

Just take a bite.   You'll see.

STAN

Per Se, Jean Georges, Nobu...

ZOE

Gray's Papaya.   Cheers.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Good, right?

ZOE (CONT'D)

You've lived here your whole life

and never been to Gray's Papaya.

What's wrong with you?

STAN

I actually haven't lived here my

whole life. We moved out of the

city when my parents bought the

farm....not died, but actually

bought a farm and moved upstate.

ZOE

That must have been a nice place to

grow up. On a farm.

25.

STAN

What about your family?

ZOE

It's just me and my grandmother.

She lives in a retirement community

in Queens.

(an awkward beat)

My parents died when I was young.

STAN

I'm so sorry.

STAN (CONT'D)

I don't know what to say now.    I've

made it all awkward and sad.

ZOE

It's okay.

(then)

My dad was kind of a bad guy,

anyway.

STAN

Shit.   I'm so sorry, Zoe.

ZOE

No, come on, we'll get all this

stuff out of the way so we never

have to talk about it again. Let's

ask all the awkward, get-to-know-

you questions right now.

STAN

Okay.   Good idea.

ZOE

Let's see...are you religious?

STAN

Nope.   What about you?

ZOE

No.

STAN

Have you ever been married?

ZOE

No.

26.

STAN

Aren't you sick of going to

weddings?

ZOE

If I have to listen to one more

couple write their own vows...

STAN

I hate when they write their own

vows!

STAN (CONT'D)

What about kids?

ZOE

What about them?

STAN

Well, do you want them?

ZOE

Yeah.   I want kids.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Do you?

STAN

Yeah.   Absolutely.

ZOE

Okay, first kiss...

STAN

Jen Salzer. Seventh grade. She

wore a head-gear. What about you?

27.

ZOE

Summer camp. I think his name was--

ZOE (CONT'D)

That was way better.

STAN

When can I see you again?

ZOE

What if I'm pregnant?

MONA

Then you'll get fat and hormonal

and I'll say, "I told you so."

ZOE

But what if this could go somewhere

with Stan? Like, really go

somewhere.

MONA

Then it will work out perfectly.

ZOE

What do you mean?

MONA

Because just when you really like

him, you'll break up because you're

pregnant and then you never have to

put yourself out there and possibly

get hurt. That's your dream.

28.

ZOE

(thinks, then)

I'm not pregnant.

MONA

So, when are you seeing him again?

ZOE

Tonight.

MONA

Well, don't have sex with him.

That's the last thing we need. You

get knocked up and we'll have no

idea who the father is.

MONA (CONT'D)

And then we'll have to do a

paternity test. Is it the cheese

farmer or the red-pubed bandit?

ZOE

I'm not going to have sex with him

tonight. It's too soon.

(for the women's benefit)

I'm not a slut.

MONA

Well, bring condoms, just in case.

(thinks, then)

And a pregnancy test.

ZOE

Very funny.

MONA

I'm not joking.

ZOE

I'm really not a slut.

29.

ZOE

There's no way, right?

ZOE

Stop looking at me like that.   I'm

not pregnant.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Come on, come on, come on...

ZOE (CONT'D)

Shit.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Shit!

ZOE (CONT'D)

Shitshitshitshit...

ZOE (CONT'D)

No, shit.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Holy fucking shit!

30.

STAN

Are you feeling okay?

STAN (CONT'D)

Good, because this should really

be a culinary adventure. This is

an underground restaurant that

moves from apartment to apartment,

depending on the chef.

STAN (CONT'D)

And some of the guys from the band

will be there. So, we might get a

little jam going. Sounds fun,

right?

(then)

Zoe?

STAN

And this looks like a mache salad

with grapes and feta.

STAN (CONT'D)

And this, oh this must be white

beans and lamb's tongue. You've

got to have some of this. Etienne

is famous for his lamb's tongue.

31.

OLIVIA

Hey, stranger.

STAN

Oh, hey, Olivia.   You remember Zoe.

OLIVIA

Right. How'd that blueberry pie

turn out?

ZOE

What?

OLIVIA

You bought blueberries from me?

Said you were going to make a pie?

ZOE

Um, can you excuse me for a second?

OLIVIA

No way she knows how to bake a pie.

ZOE

I'm pregnant.

BOBBY (O.S.)

What?!   Where are you? I'm on my

way.

ZOE

Brooklyn.

BOBBY (O.S.)

Where's that?

MONA (O.S.)

Don't panic. Could be a false

positive. Take another test.

32.

ZOE

I can't. I'm at some underground

foodie party in Brooklyn. Where am

I gonna--

BOBBY (O.S.)

Okay, I'm looking at a subway map.

Which way is Brooklyn?

STAN

Where have you been?

ZOE

Sorry.   You scared me.

STAN

Did you just go to the store?

ZOE

Yeah, I had a little emergency. I

have a, a, um...corn, and I needed

to get those little...corn pads.

STAN

Corn pads?

ZOE

I know, it's gross. Do you know

where the bathroom is?

33.

STAN

What's a corn pad?

ZOE

Corn pad?    What the hell is wrong

with you?

ZOE (CONT'D)

Corn pad.    Jesus Christ.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Relax! I'll be out in...

(checks box)

Three to five minutes.

ZOE

Excuse me, are you allowed to drink

when you're...

ZOE (CONT'D)

You know...

PREGNANT WOMAN

Pregnant?

(off Zoe's nod)

My doctor says one glass is--

34.

STAN

Who makes me forget all the other

girls I met, sweet, little Miss

Blue Eyes. Who's sweeter to me,

than she really ought to be, sweet

little Miss Blue Eyes.

STAN (CONT'D)

Who's gonna start takin' care of my

heart, she makes me realize. And

it's lucky for me and I really want

to be with...

(winks at Zoe)

sweet, little Miss--

STAN (CONT'D)

Blue eyes?

ZOE

Ohhhhhhhh.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Please, God...

35.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Water, water everywhere, but not a

drop to...

ZOE (CONT'D)

Fuck me.

STAN

My singing made you vomit.

ZOE

No.    It's not that.

STAN

Sure, we were a little out of tune,

but...

ZOE

I really don't feel well.

STAN

Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk?

CAROL

Zoe?

ZOE

Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there...

CAROL

Where have you been?    You haven't

been coming to any--

ZOE

(cutting her off)

Right. I know. I've been so busy.

Next one, I'm there. For sure.

(then, awkward)

This is my friend, Stan.

36.

STAN

Hi.

CAROL

(eyeing Stan suspiciously)

Hello. Are you two--

ZOE

Late. Yes. We are. We really

are.

(pushing Stan along)

I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.

STAN

An old...boyfriend?

ZOE

Her name is Carol. We're on

a...committee together.

ZOE (CONT'D)

All right. I have to go to bed

now. I'll call you, okay?

STAN

Okay.

(then)

Hey, I was thinking, if you don't

have any plans this weekend, maybe

you'd like to come up to the farm

and get away for a few days.

ZOE

I'll call you tomorrow.

Something's not agreeing with me.

STAN

Was it the lamb's tongue?

STAN (CONT'D)

Okay, well...this weekend.   Think

about it.

37.

ZOE

What the hell have I done?

ANNIE

Hi, Zoe.   You look fantastic.

ZOE

I don't know how that's possible.

ANNIE

Something's different. Did you get

highlights or a spray tan? Your

face looks like it's...

ZOE

Please don't say glowing.

ANNIE

Yes!   Exactly!

ZOE

Morning, Arthur.

38.

ARTHUR

Hello, my dear!

ZOE

No, no, no, don't get up.

ARTHUR

Good, because I can't get up. Came

to see my lovely fiance? She's

looking fine today, let me tell

you. Fine.

ZOE

Hi, Nana.

NANA

One more mile to go. Do you have a

minute? Talk to Arthur.

ARTHUR

That's what I'm talking about.

Work it.

NANA

Do you want a nose guard?   I have

an extra.

ZOE

No, I'm fine.

SHIRLEY

Are you sure? Ethel Silverbeck

just had another carcinoma removed

from her nose.

ZOE

(to Nana)

I kind of need to talk to you.

Alone.

39.

NANA

Don't worry, they can't hear

anything anyway.

ZOE

I'm pregnant.

NANA

(can't hear her)

What?

ZOE

I'm pregnant.

NANA

What?

ZOE

I'm pregnant.

NANA

I can't hear you, darling.

SHIRLEY

Jesus, Judy, she's pregnant.   Turn

your hearing aide up.

ZOE

What am I going to do?

NANA

I'm confused. Isn't this what you

wanted? You bought sperm and were

inseminated by your doctor. This

isn't what we would call an

accident.

ZOE

But now it's all happening so fast.

Did I really think this through?

40.

NANA

ZOE

NANA

ZOE

NANA

ZOE

(then)

NANA

ZOE

NANA

ZOE

NANA

ZOE

41.

NANA

You might find out he's a total

douchebag and then the whole thing

is moot.

ZOE

Okay, so we'll just hope that he's

a douchebag. Could happen, right?

ZOE (CONT'D)

I'm sorry.     Am I keeping you up?

ZOE (CONT'D)

My whole life is falling apart and

you can't keep your bug-eyes open?

(yawning)

Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why

am I so tired? I slept nine hours.

(thinks, then)

And I'm starving, too. What the

hell is going on?

ZOE

Am I even allowed to drink coffee?

ZOE (CONT'D)

Do you know anything about being

pregnant?

42.

ZOE

Thanks a lot, decaf.

STAN (O.S.)

Where are you?

ZOE

I have no idea.

ZOE

He's so not a douchebag.

ZOE

I can't believe you live here.

This is ridiculous.

43.

STAN

I just come on weekends. My

parents really live here.

ZOE

Oh.   Where are they now?

STAN

In the kitchen.

ZOE

Wait, they're here? Now? Is this

a "meet the parents" kind of thing?

I wasn't prepared for this.

STAN

No. Not at all.    I mean, you'll

meet them, but--

ZOE

When you said come up for the

weekend, I assumed it was just us.

(then)

I think I need to lay down.

STAN

Are you hung-over or something?

ZOE

I'm just...not myself. Give me ten

minutes. A ten-minute power nap

and I'm good. I need to regroup.

STAN

Are you sure you're okay?

(then)

Zoe? Hello?

44.

EDWARD

Oh.   It's just you.

STAN

She's taking a nap.

JOAN

A nap?   Now? She just got here.

STAN

Mom, I need you to not be

judgemental, okay. I like this

girl a lot.

JOAN

How can I be judgemental?    We

haven't even met her yet.

JOAN (CONT'D)

What the heck is that?

STAN

Oh.   This is Nuts.

JOAN

Who's judging?!

ZOE

What was that?

ZOE (CONT'D)

Whoa.

45.

ZOE

(whispering)

Stan?

ZOE (CONT'D)

Stan!

ZOE

Stan?    Hello?

ZOE (CONT'D)

Oh, my God.

ZOE (CONT'D)

(mouth full)

Oh, my God.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Oh, who am I kidding?

ZOE (CONT'D)

Oh.   My.    God.

46.

JOAN

Would you like a plate?

JOAN (CONT'D)

A napkin?

JOAN (CONT'D)

I'm Joan.

JOAN (CONT'D)

And you must be Zoe.

EDWARD

The stew is delicious, honey.

STAN

Yeah, Mom, it's awesome.

EDWARD

(to Zoe)

Have you ever in your life had stew

like this? Come on, be honest.

ZOE

Uh...no.    Never.

47.

JOAN

So are all the animals in your pet

store...differently abled?

ZOE

Oh, you can say paralyzed. He

doesn't mind.

(then)

No, our pets are all in great

shape. Purebreads mostly, but not

from puppy mills.

JOAN

Those puppy mills are terrible.    I

read about them in the paper.

ZOE

Well, that's actually how I ended

up with Nuts. I bought him from

this pet store near my house. Six

months later, I had thousands of

dollars in vet bills and had to put

him in a wheelchair.

EDWARD

You should have sued that place.

ZOE

I thought about it, but what was

that really going to do? They were

still going to sell inbred dogs.

So...I took the money I made when I

left Google and just bought the

place figuring I would do better.

STAN

You worked for Google?

STAN (CONT'D)

How could I not know that?

ZOE

You never asked.

48.

STAN

And you made a lot of money and

then bought a pet store?

STAN (CONT'D)

I love that.

ZOE

It's been fun. Beats brand

management, that's for sure.

JOAN

(to Edward)

That sounds like us, honey.

EDWARD

It's true.

(to Zoe)

When we bought this farm we just

wanted to make cheese because we

couldn't find anything we liked in

the stores. And now, twenty years

later, here we are...

JOAN

Sometimes in life you just have to

take matters into your own hands.

Make things happen your own way,

you know?

STAN

I can't believe that Nuts has an

off-road wheelchair.

ZOE

He's got one for snow, too.      With

little skis on the bottom.

49.

ZOE (CONT'D)

What?

STAN

You're really something.

ZOE

Are you making fun of me?   Do you

think I spoil him?

STAN

No, I really think you're amazing.

I mean, that story you told

tonight. You just quit your whole

professional life because of this

little dog? Started your own

business, just like that?

STAN (CONT'D)

You're very...unique.

ZOE

Well, you're a dime a dozen. I

can't tell you how many banjo

playing, cheese makers I've been

with.

STAN

I keep waiting for the other shoe

to drop. Like, how can you be so

perfect? Why are you even still

single? I can't believe no one's

snatched you up by now.

ZOE

I drive them all away, I guess.

STAN

Yeah, right.

STAN (CONT'D)

Look, I know this is all going

fast...the time we're spending

together, meeting my parents and

everything...but, I'm okay with

that. I want it to go fast.

ZOE

It is going fast.

50.

STAN

But isn't that okay? Aren't we old

enough to skip all the bullshit?

What are we waiting for? I...want

to be with you.

ZOE

Stan.

STAN

Come on. There's something I want

to show you.

ZOE

What is it?

STAN

It's cheese.

ZOE

I can see that.

STAN

It's a new kind of goat's milk

we're using. I've been developing

the recipe, and now it needs to

age. It'll be ready for market in

several months.

(then, excited)

Want to know what it's called?

ZOE

Okay.

STAN

Zoe.

ZOE

You named a piece of cheese after

me?

STAN

Not just one piece. The whole

line. This will forever in history

be known as the Zoe.

(MORE)

51.

STAN (CONT'D)

Unless, of course, it tastes like

shit, and then we'll just scrap it.

(with a wink)

But that'll never happen.

ZOE

How do you know?

STAN

Because it's going to be fantastic.

Sweet and sassy and very complex.

Why do you think I'm calling it

Zoe?

ZOE

No one's ever named a piece of

cheese after me before.

STAN

You're kind of hard to read right

now. You're either seriously

flattered or totally repulsed.

STAN (CONT'D)

What?

ZOE

I want to kiss you right now, but

it really smells like cheese in

here.

52.

ZOE

(under her breath)

You're such a douchebag.

STAN

What?

DISSOLVE TO:

STAN

That was amazing. I mean, like,

totally and exceptionally, over-the-

top, amazing.

ZOE

Stan.

STAN

Yeah.

ZOE

There's something I really have to

tell you.

STAN

There's something I have to tell

you, too.

STAN (CONT'D)

Can I go first? `Cause if we're

going to say the same thing, I want

to say it first.

ZOE

We're not going to say the same

thing.

53.

STAN

Well, let me go, because this is

really embarrassing, and I just

have to say it.

ZOE

Okay.

STAN

I've dated a lot of women. I mean,

not tons, but a lot. And, the

thing is, I've never...been in love

before. I've never even told

anyone I love them before. Because

I just never felt it. But from the

day we met, from the first time our

backs accidentally touched in the

subway, I feel this, this...

(he shakes his head)

Maybe this is too much to say right

now, but...I love you, Zoe. I

really do.

STAN (CONT'D)

In my mind, you were supposed to

say, I love you, too.

STAN

Zoe?

STAN (CONT'D)

Why are you crying? Everything's

perfect.

ZOE

It's not.

STAN

Sure it is.

54.

STAN (CONT'D)

What?

ZOE

I'm pregnant.

STAN

Uh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't

happen that fast.

ZOE

I just found out.

STAN

Pregnant? As in you're going to

have a baby?

STAN (CONT'D)

I don't understand.

ZOE

I know.   It's hard to explain.

STAN

Well, who's it?

ZOE

I don't know.

STAN

What?

ZOE

I don't know who the father is. I

kind of know him. I just don't

know his name exactly. It was sort

of anonymous.

STAN

Anonymous?

ZOE

He's a donor. From a sperm bank.

STAN

Seriously, what the fuck are you

talking about? Sperm bank? What?

55.

ZOE

I know, this is so fucked up.

STAN

When did all of this happen?

ZOE

The day we met. That same day.

And I didn't tell you because I

didn't think there was any way I

could be pregnant.

STAN

But...why?

ZOE

Because supposedly with frozen

sperm it takes a few tries and...

STAN

No, why would you do this?

ZOE

Because I wanted a baby. And I'm

almost forty, and I never met the

right guy. I was afraid if I

waited any longer it would all pass

me by, and I'd miss my chance.

ZOE (CONT'D)

I didn't know you. I would have

never done it if--

STAN

I just told you I loved you.

ZOE

Well....do you not now?

STAN

You're pregnant.

ZOE

Don't say it like that.

STAN

You're pregnant.

ZOE

Yes.   I'm pregnant.      I'm pregnant!

56.

STAN

I tell you I'm in love with you and

you tell me your pregnant with some

stranger's child?

ZOE

Don't say it like that.     You make

it sound dirty.

STAN

I'm sorry. I...I'm stunned. I

don't know what to say. What the

fuck am I supposed to say?! This

is great fucking news?

Congratulations?! Why did you wait

so long to tell me?

ZOE

Because I'm freaking out, okay! I

didn't know what to do. I made

this big decision to do this and

then I met you--

STAN

Well, what am I supposed to do now?

This isn't how it was supposed to

be. This isn't what--

ZOE

I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Life

isn't perfect. It's not all neat

and tidy like your perfect family

and your perfect farm and your

bluegrass band. It's messy. It's

fucked up. This is real life,

okay? I'm sorry to break it to

you.

ZOE (CONT'D)

I'm sorry.

STAN

Sorry?   What's sorry going to do?

57.

JOAN

Oh, I thought you were in your

room. Sorry.

(then)

Everything okay?

JOAN (CONT'D)

Well, she seems really terrific.

Dad and I both think so. She's

smart and poised and...

JOAN (CONT'D)

And warm and gracious...

JOAN (CONT'D)

And pretty and...

JOAN (CONT'D)

What the hell's going on in there?

STAN

She's pregnant.

JOAN

Oh, dear God.

58.

ZOE

I don't know what to say.

ZOE (CONT'D)

I guess I'd given up on meeting

someone like you, and I did what I

thought was best.

ZOE (CONT'D)

But, for what it's worth...I love

you, too.

MONA

Come here.

59.

DR. HARRIS

Congratulations! What luck to get

pregnant on the first try, huh?

And with frozen sperm, too. So,

how are we feeling?

ZOE

(unconvincing)

Okay.

DR. HARRIS

You sure about that?

ZOE

It's been hard. I don't know if I

was really prepared for this.

DR. HARRIS

Well, your hormones aren't helping,

and going through this without a

partner must be difficult.

DR. HARRIS (CONT'D)

Well, the good news is everything

looks great. You are now eight

weeks pregnant, which is an

important milestone. With a little

luck, we should be able to see a

heartbeat today.

ZOE

That's it?     That's...my baby?

ZOE (CONT'D)

Hi, Baby.

(then)

Is it okay? Is it healthy?

DR. HARRIS

Everything's just...

(makes a face, then)

Wait, a minute...

ZOE

What?   Wait a minute, what?

60.

DR. HARRIS

Well...I see another heartbeat.

ZOE

(freaking out)

It has two hearts?

DR. HARRIS

No...but you have two babies.

CAROL

Twins!   That's fantastic!

LORI

Why are you crying?   That's so

lucky.

ZOE

Yup.   That's me.   Lucky, lucky, me.

CAROL

Are you okay? Is it a financial

concern? There are many programs--

ZOE

No. I'm fairly loaded, actually.

Used to work for Google.

(blows nose)

I'm sorry. This is hard for me. I

don't know if I can talk about it

yet.

CAROL

Take your time. When you feel like

sharing, we're here for you. We're

all sisters here.

(then, to the group)

Let's give Zoe some space. When

she's ready to talk, we're ready to

listen. Deep, cleansing breaths,

Zoe.

61.

CAROL (CONT'D)

Now, in the meantime, does anyone

else have anything they want to

discuss? Problems? Concerns?

TABITHA

I'm having a hard time. Luca keeps

asking why he doesn't have a daddy,

and I just don't know what--

ZOE

(blurting out)

There's this guy. His name is

Stan. And he's fantastic.

CAROL

I knew it!

TABITHA

Uh...wasn't I just speaking?

CAROL

I knew you were with that guy!

SARA

What guy?

LORI

Zoe, this group is called Single

Mother's By Choice.

ZOE

I know.   I'm sorry--

TABITHA

Um, excuse me. What about Luca?

He's been really, really sad.

ZOE

(floodgates opening)

Have you ever met a guy and you get

butterflies and you think this is

the kind of man who could take care

of me forever? The kind of guy who

makes you re-examine everything?

Like, maybe I can be a stay-at-home

mom and be barefoot and pregnant.

62.

ZOE (CONT'D)

He actually lives on a farm! Plays

the banjo! Maybe I could learn to

sew and take care of the animals.

Like Laura Ingalls.

ZOE

Carol, thank you. This has been

really helpful. Just getting it

all out and being with other women

who--

CAROL

I'm going to have to ask you not to

come back.

ZOE

What?   Why?

CAROL

I don't think we can help you, and,

quite frankly, you're against

everything we stand for.

ZOE

But, I thought we were all sisters.

CAROL

No.  Not you.

(then)

Do you know how long it took me to

conceive? Five years. I had three

miscarriages and spent every last

dime on in-vitro. And Dana? The

woman with the short hair?

ZOE

Which one?

CAROL

The one with the really short hair?

ZOE

Yeah, that doesn't really narrow it

down much.

63.

CAROL

She   just flew to Memphis to watch

her   baby being born. Seconds after

the   birth, the birth mother changed

her   mind and refused to give it up.

CAROL (CONT'D)

So, as you can see, we are really

dedicated and choosing to be single

mothers, and you seem to be in a

slightly different place. You're

carrying two healthy babies, and

you have no idea how lucky you are.

ZOE

(after a beat)

You're right.

CAROL

I like you, Zoe. We all like you.

But you kind of need to figure out

where you are.

NANA

That man is obsessed with my ass.

ZOE

I know.   It's kind of upsetting.

NANA

He wants to take me on a cruise so

that we can finally tie the knot.

But, I don't know. What's the

hurry?

ZOE

You've been engaged for nine years.

NANA

No reason to rush into anything.

64.

NANA (CONT'D)

You look terrible, dear.

ZOE

Thanks.

NANA

You must really love him, huh?

ZOE

I guess I do.

NANA

Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and

I'm sure he loves you, too. But,

you have put him in a really

awkward position. Having a baby is

a big adjustment for any couple.

And you're not married. And he's

not the father. And you've only

been together a little while. And

now you're having twins. And--

ZOE

Please stop.

NANA

I'm just saying, if he actually

wanted to stay with you right now,

he'd be the greatest man in the

world, and, quite frankly, I don't

think any man is that great.

NANA (CONT'D)

Arthur's just about the best man I

know, and look at him. He's a

fucking idiot.

JOAN

You know, people thought we were

crazy when we bought this farm.

(MORE)

65.

JOAN (CONT'D)

All of our friends in New York,

they thought we'd lost our minds.

JOAN (CONT'D)

I guess I'm saying that you may

have envisioned your life going one

way, but the reality is, it could

go a totally different direction.

You just have to be open to it.

STAN

Having a baby with someone I barely

know, someone else's baby...it's

just not how I pictured it.

JOAN

I used to work on Wall Street. Now

I wear boots covered in goat shit.

This isn't how I pictured it,

either. But guess what...I'm

happy.

66.

LORI

Make sure you put your numbers

down. I want to have everyone's

number handy in case I go into

labor early.

ZOE

Hi, guys.

CAROL

Hi, Zoe.

ZOE

I just wanted to apologize. I'm

sorry I got into a relationship and

wasn't honest with you guys, and

I'm sorry I interrupted you,

Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing

better.

TABITHA

Thanks.

ZOE

(to Carol)

And I've thought a lot about what

you said, about how lucky I am. I

got into this whole situation

because I wanted to have a baby.

And, somehow, I lost sight of that.

(then)

Anyway, I need partners in this,

and I hope you'll take me back.

ZOE (CONT'D)

What's this?

LORI

It's a phone tree. I'm due next

month, but my midwife thinks I may

go sooner. I want everyone to be

there. Are you in?

ZOE

I'm in.

67.

ZOE

Hi.

WOMAN

Hi.

TWIN TODDLERS

Hi./Hi.

STAN

Hi.

ZOE

Hi.

STAN

Hi.

ZOE

You said that already.

STAN

You...look great.

STAN (CONT'D)

How are you feeling?

ZOE

Okay.

STAN

Good.

68.

ZOE

You have a beard.

STAN

Yeah, it's awful isn't it.

ZOE

No.

STAN

Don't lie.

(then)

Did I tell you how pretty you look?

STAN (CONT'D)

I miss you.

ZOE

I miss you, too.

STAN

This whole time we've been apart,

I've been trying to figure out what

it is about you that I love so

much. And I think that it's that a

lot of people talk about doing

things, but you actually do them.

You're really kind of daring. How

you quit your job and took over a

pet store all because some asshole

sold you a lame dog. You came and

found me at the Farmer's Market

even though the night before I

acted like a total stalker...

STAN (CONT'D)

And now you're pregnant. Because

you wanted to have a baby and

didn't think you could wait any

longer. Well, that's just the same

kind of thing. It's...brave. And

I can't love you for being that way

but then walk away for the same

reason.

69.

STAN (CONT'D)

I love you. I've been waiting my

whole life for you. And I can't

let one little baby get in the way

of that. I just...can't.

ZOE

There's something I need to tell

you.

STAN

Okay.

ZOE

It's big. And you're allowed to

take all of this back when I tell

you.

STAN

What.

ZOE

It's not just one baby....I'm

having twins.

STAN

This is insane.

STAN

Do you feel any kicking?

ZOE

Sometimes.

STAN

What does it feel like?

ZOE

Like butterflies.

70.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Are you really sure you want to do

this?

STAN

Yeah.     I'm really sure.

ZOE

Are you okay?

STAN

They're so...perfect.      They look

like real babies.

DR. HARRIS

Would you like to know the sexes?

ZOE

Yes.     Tell us.

DR. HARRIS

You're having two healthy little

girls.

STAN

Two girls?

ZOE

Two girls.

DR. HARRIS

Congratulations.

71.

STAN

Two girls!

STAN (CONT'D)

Hi.

WOMAN

Hi.

CHEF

Here we have a yellowtail sashimi

with ponzu sauce and pea shoots.

This is carpaccio with shaved white

truffles. And, finally, an

heirloom tomato salad with fresh

Buratta flown in from Italy this

morning.

STAN

Thanks, Sam. It looks incredible.

STAN (CONT'D)

Aren't you hungry?

ZOE

I can't eat any of this.

STAN

Why not?

72.

ZOE

(pointing to each dish)

Raw. Raw. Unpasteurized.

(re: champagne)

Alcohol.

STAN

Let me get Sam back. He'll make

you anything you want.

ZOE

I don't want to hurt his feelings.

You go ahead. I'm fine.

STAN

Well, what are you going to eat?

CASHIER

Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with

cheese, four large fries, and a six

piece chicken McNuggets?

ZOE

Make that an eight, no, ten-piece

McNuggets.

(to Stan)

You'll have some, right?

STAN

No.

ZOE

(back to the cashier)

Ten-piece. Someone will eat them.

73.

ZOE

(re: book)

Have you gotten to page 79 yet?

STAN

No. I stopped reading when you

ripped out one of my pages and used

it as a napkin.

ZOE

Says here many women in the second

trimester experience an increased

sexual appetite.

STAN

Really?

STAN (CONT'D)

Are you coming on to me? It's kind

of hard to tell right now.

ZOE

Yeah.   I'm coming on to you.

ZOE (CONT'D)

What?

STAN

You have chicken in your hair.

MONA

Why are you even working out? This

is the one time in your life you're

allowed to let it go.

ZOE

Because look at me. I just keep

getting bigger and bigger.

74.

MONA

Well, yeah. That's kind of how it

goes.

ZOE

I'm afraid I'm going to scare him

away. I'm like one of those giant

bouncy castles. Soon I'm going to

take over the whole back yard.

MONA

Come on.   He loves you for you.

ZOE

I'm just getting kind of freaked

out by everything. He asked me to

go to this wedding with him. What

kind of first impression am I going

to make on all of his friends?

MONA

Well, you're knocked up with some

stranger's twins. So, already

you're not exactly...

ZOE

Not helping.

MONA

Do you have anything to wear at

least?

STAN

Everything okay in there?

STAN (CONT'D)

Never mind.

ZOE (O.S.)

This SUCKS!!!

STAN

Honey, whatever you wear is fine.

75.

ZOE (O.S.)

I don't have anything to wear!

That's the problem.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Fuuuuuuck!

STAN

You always look great. I've never

seen you not look great.

STAN (CONT'D)

That's perfect. You look hot.

ZOE

Really?    You think?

STAN

Do you have a shawl or something?

STAN

You look smokin'.

ZOE

Thanks, honey.

STAN

Let's go.     We're super late.

ZOE

Hmmmm...

76.

STAN

Why don't you sort of go in...head

first and then turn around.

ZOE

Shut up and push me.

STAN

Push you?

ZOE

Just do it.

ZOE

I hate everyone.

ZOE

Do you think he's telling everyone

why I didn't go? I'm too much of a

fat-ass walrus to go to the

wedding?

BOBBY

You're not a fat ass walrus.

You're pregnant.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Why are you crying? So what?   You

missed a stupid wedding.

(MORE)

77.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

You got to have girls' night with

me. This is way more fun.

ZOE

I don't know. I'm just so

emotional lately. It's the

hormones.

BOBBY

You can't help it. Being pregnant

sucks. You're emotional, and

irrational, and you get back fat.

ZOE

I have back fat?

BOBBY

No.  I'm just kidding.

(then)

Okay, yes. You have back fat.

ZOE

How's Stan going to stay with me

through this? I'm disgusting.

BOBBY

We'll go shopping tomorrow. We'll

get some hip maternity clothes...

whatever that means.

ZOE

Look at me, Bobby.

BOBBY

What?

ZOE

(pinching back fat)

Look at me. What do you see?

BOBBY

I see the most amazingly wonderful

person I know.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

With back fat.

78.

OLIVIA

Why aren't you dancing?

STAN

I'm just about to go.    It's late.

OLIVIA

Come on, one dance.

OLIVIA (CONT'D)

For old time's sake.

STAN

I have a girlfriend, Olivia.

OLIVIA

Never stopped you before.

STAN

It's serious this time.

ZOE

How was it?

STAN

Boring.

ZOE

Good.

79.

ZOE (CONT'D)

STAN

ZOE

STAN

ZOE

STAN

ZOE

STAN

ZOE

(lying)

STAN

ZOE

STAN

80.

ZOE

This is my old ass.

STAN

Why do you have a picture of your

ass?

ZOE

My college boyfriend took it. So,

I guess in fairness, my ass doesn't

look exactly like this anymore, but

it's pretty close. It's held up.

STAN

It's a nice ass.

ZOE

You said you don't know the real

me, so I thought I'd show you.

ZOE (CONT'D)

This is me in seventh grade.

STAN

Wow.

ZOE

I know.

81.

STAN

You look like Anthony Michael Hall.

ZOE

This period, as horrible as it was,

made me who I am. I think every

person should go through a

hideously ugly phase. It builds

character.

(then)

It also taught me that I should

never, under any circumstances,

have short hair and a perm again.

ZOE (CONT'D)

This   is one of my favorites because

look   how happy I am. I don't even

know   what place yellow is, but I'm

sure   it's not good.

STAN

Fifth place.

ZOE

But I still look super happy,

right? That's all because of Nana.

Whatever I did, she thought it was

the best.

ZOE (CONT'D)

These are my best friends, Bobby

and Mona. Mona and I met in high

school and Bobby passed out on my

couch in college and never left.

You haven't met them yet because

they might scare you away.

STAN

Why are you dressed like that?

ZOE

Halloween. We were supposed to be

a traffic light but Mona bagged out

at the last minute and so Bobby and

I just look like idiots. That's

typical Mona, by the way.

82.

ZOE (CONT'D)

This is my mom.

STAN

You look just like her.

ZOE

This is the last picture of her

that I have. She lived for a few

more years, but we never took any

pictures because she didn't want us

to remember her like that. I was

eight when she died.

STAN

I...can't imagine.

ZOE

She had a great laugh. And really

soft hands. She used to rub my

back before I went to sleep.

STAN

Do you have any pictures of your

dad?

STAN (CONT'D)

I'm sorry. If you don't want to

talk about it...

ZOE

My mother was in a coma for two

years before the end. That's when

my dad left her.

STAN

Oh.

ZOE

So...that's when he died.    To us,

anyway.

STAN

God, Zoe.    I'm so sorry.

83.

ZOE

(after a beat)

It's okay. It was an important

lesson. That's when I realized

that nothing lasts forever.

ZOE (CONT'D)

So, that's my story. That's the

real me.

STAN

Things can last forever, you know.

ZOE

Not for me they can't.

ZOE (CONT'D)

That's weird.

STAN

I'm confused. Why did you say you

would come witness this birth in

the first place?

ZOE

I don't know. Seemed like a good

idea at the time. I was trying to

get back in their good graces. Go

home. I'll meet you there. I

don't want them to see you anyway.

STAN

It's four in the morning. I'm not

letting you walk home alone.

ZOE

Fine. I'll just pop in, show my

face and leave. Ten minutes, tops.

84.

CAROL

Zoe, it's so nice of you to come,

especially at this crazy hour.

LORI

You're really one of us now.

ZOE

Are you sure you're in labor?

You're so calm.

LORI

Oh, I'm sure.

ZOE

Well, I just wanted to come and say

a quick hi and good luck.

LORI

You're not staying?

CAROL

You have to stay. Lori wants us

all to be together for this.

ZOE

Well, I really want to be here

but...um, the truth is...actually

I've been wanting to tell you guys

for a while but, the truth is...

CAROL

(whispering)

She's having a contraction.

LORI

Okay.   What was it you were saying?

ZOE

I'm back with Stan.

85.

LORI

Stan who?

CAROL

The farmer?

ZOE

Actually, he makes cheese. He

named a cheese after me. Isn't

that romantic? Sort of?

(off their blank stares)

Well, anyway, I'm not technically a

single mother by choice anymore.

So, if you want me to leave right

now, I totally understand. I'll

just walk out the door and--

LORI

No, I really want you to stay.

ZOE

(bummed)

Oh.

CAROL

Listen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're

happy. We'd love to meet him.

Bring him to group any time.

ZOE

Well, actually, he's downstairs, so

I should probably get back to--

LORI

Great.   Invite him up.

ZOE

Oh, no, no, no...

LORI

I'm not shy. I've been through

this before. It's quite beautiful,

really.

86.

STAN

Excuse me?

ZOE

Just a few minutes.

STAN

I don't know, Zoe.

ZOE

You have to come up. They begged

me. And truthfully, I'm kind of

scared of them. Please?

STAN

This is weird.

ZOE

Good brownies, though. This one

has peanut butter in it.

CAROL

Come on everybody, it's time.

She's getting into the water.

STAN

The what?

CAROL

Oh, it's a water birth.   Didn't Zoe

tell you?

STAN

What's a water birth?

ZOE

I don't know. But just so we're

clear, this...

(re. the whole scene)

Is not the real me.

87.

STAN

I'll wait here.

CAROL

Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

ZOE

(eyes wide)

Wow. Wow. Wow.

CAROL

I know. It's amazing how the body

can open up like that.

ZOE

I'm just going to get some air.

I'm feeling a little...

LORI

Don't move, Zoe, you're my focal

point.

MIDWIFE

Push, Lori. Push.

CAROL

You can't leave.   You're her focal

point.

ZOE

Can't she use someone else?

88.

CAROL

She's in labor. You want to argue

with her now?

DISSOLVE TO:

CAROL

Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

ZOE

Oh, Jesus.

(then)

What is...that?

CAROL

Sssshh. It's perfectly natural.

Sometimes the bowels just let go.

(then, back to chanting)

Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

LORI

(yelling)

Don't move, Zoe, I need you!

You're my focal point.

ZOE

What does that even mean?

LORI

I need to turn over.    Please!

JESSIE

Do it, Lori. We're here for you.

We're all here for you.

89.

CAROL

(excited)

Here comes the head.

JESSIE

We can see the head, Lori.

CAROL

There's so much hair!

ZOE

(woozy, afraid)

I don't think that's the baby's

hair.

LORI

I want to see the head. Get me a

mirror. It's in the bedroom.

ZOE

I'll get it.

LORI

GOD DAMN IT ZOE, DON'T MOVE!!!!

CAROL (O.S.)

Stan, get the mirror!

STAN

Excuse me.     Hello. I'm Stan.

Excuse me.     Hi. I'm Stan.

90.

LORI

Look at all that wet, curly hair.

STAN

(freaking out)

Let's get the hell out of here.

ZOE

I can't.   I'm her focal point.

STAN

What does that mean?

ZOE

I don't know.

FADE TO BLACK.

STAN

Are you okay?

ZOE

I don't know. Why am I wet?

ZOE (CONT'D)

What is that?

91.

STAN

(afraid)

I think it's the placenta.

FADE TO BLACK.

ZOE

Wow. We really shouldn't have seen

that.

STAN

No.

ZOE

I did mention that I barely know

those people, right?

STAN

Like forty times.

ZOE

I feel the need to say it again.

STAN

It won't be like that for us.

ZOE

How do you know?

STAN

Well, for starters, you wax.

OLIVIA

Oh, hi.

92.

STAN

Hi.

(awkward beat, then)

You remember Zoe.

OLIVIA

Right, hi.

OLIVIA (CONT'D)

Wow.

(then, to Stan)

Wow.

ZOE

What is that supposed to mean?

OLIVIA

It's nothing.

OLIVIA (CONT'D)

(re. Zoe's pregnant belly)

I had no idea it was that serious.

STAN

I told you it was serious.

ZOE

(interrupting)

What the hell does, "sorry about

last night" mean?

OLIVIA

It's stupid. I was drunk and...

STAN

It was nothing.

ZOE

What was nothing?

OLIVIA

You're having a baby? I didn't

know you'd been together that long.

93.

STAN

Well, they're not mine...but, yeah,

we're having a baby. Two actually.

CUT TO:

STAN

Nothing happened.

ZOE

Get away from me.

STAN

Nothing happened!

ZOE

You said, "they're not mine."

STAN

I didn't mean to say it.

ZOE

How could you say that?

STAN

I don't know. I was flustered.

ZOE

Flustered?

STAN

I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking

straight. I've been up all night

watching Orca give birth!

ZOE

(incredulous)

"They're not mine?"

STAN

(at a loss )

Well, I mean...technically, they're

not.

94.

ZOE

You know, all this time you're

trying to figure out who the real

me is, but who the fuck are you?

STAN

Zoe.

MONA

Do you really think something

happened with the berry girl?    They

both said nothing happened.

ZOE

Well, are they going to come out

and tell me? And that's not even

the point. He said, the babies

weren't his. And if he says that,

he thinks that. And if he thinks

that, he's not really committed.

MONA

So, now you run?

ZOE

Why should I stick around for the

end of the story when I know what

it's going to be?

ZOE (CONT'D)

What? If you want to say

something, say it.

95.

MONA

Do you know the end of the story?

Can't you just give him the benefit

of the doubt? He seems like such a

good guy.

ZOE

You haven't even met him.

MONA

Yeah, and don't think I don't know

the reason for that. You were

never going to see this through,

Zoe. Never. It was doomed before

it began. Just like all of your

relationships. You get out before

you get hurt.

ZOE

You don't think I'm hurt right now?

MONA

Every man is not your father. When

are you going to realize that?

ZOE

You don't know what you're talking

about.

MONA

I've known you for thirty years. I

know you don't trust people. You

and your grandmother, both. She's

been engaged to Arthur for how long

now?

ZOE

Leave Nana out of this.

MONA

She's never going to marry him.

Just like you'd never marry Stan.

No wonder you ended up with a sperm

donor. He'll never let you down.

It's your ideal boyfriend.

ZOE

I used a donor because I wanted a

baby.

MONA

I'm sorry.     I went too far.

96.

ZOE

Because I wanted to have a family.

Because Nana is the only one I've

got and she's eighty-four years

old. And then it will just be me.

So, yeah, you went a little too

far.

ZOE

Guess it's just you and me again.

ZOE

What.

STAN

It's Thursday. We have a doctor's

appointment.

ZOE

There is no "we", Stan.

STAN

Come on, I didn't mean to say it,

and that's not how I feel.

ZOE

I made a mistake trusting you.

STAN

Don't say that.     That's not true.

ZOE

You're not good for me. You made

me think I needed you, and I don't.

97.

STAN

So that's it? Because of one

stupid, asinine thing that I said,

it's all over? This is how it

ends?

ZOE

Yes.  This is how it ends.

(then)

I don't know why you're so

surprised. I told you, nothing

lasts forever.

DR. HARRIS

Things look great.

ZOE

Good.

DR. HARRIS

So, I'll see you back in two weeks,

and we'll start checking to see if

the babies are dropping.

ZOE

It's hard to believe we're in the

home stretch.

DR. HARRIS

Now's the time I start discussing a

birthing plan with my patients. Do

you want me to wait until next time

when Stan's here?

ZOE

Oh.    Uh, no. He won't be here.

DR. HARRIS

He's out of town or something?

ZOE

No.    He's just...out.

98.

DR. HARRIS

Oh.   I'm sorry to hear that.

ZOE

It's back to just you and me now.

We've come full circle.

DR. HARRIS

Well, don't you want anyone with

you in the delivery room? You

know, like a birthing partner?

NANA

Me?

ZOE

Yeah.   Is that okay?

NANA

Of course.

ZOE

Good.   `Cause you're all I've got.

NANA

What do I have to do?

ZOE

I don't know. It will be a

c-section, so, basically, just

stand there and try not to faint.

NANA

I can do that.

ZOE

Thanks, Nana. It means a lot to me

that you'll be there.

NANA

Are you kidding me? I've been

waiting my whole life for this.

ZOE

Holy shit, is he dead?

99.

NANA

Sleeping.

ZOE

How can you tell?

NANA

He's been like that all morning.    I

wore him out last night.

ZOE

Wow.   I did not need to know that.

NANA

We were celebrating.

(with a smile)

We finally set a date.

ZOE

Excuse me?

NANA

So, we'll put the band here and the

dance floor right here.

ZOE

I can't believe you're getting

married. What made you change your

mind?

NANA

All of a sudden it just hit me,

what am I waiting for? I love him.

He loves me. What am I so afraid

of?

ZOE

Wow.   This is...really big news.

NANA

You don't seem happy.

ZOE

No, I am. It's just...it just

makes my situation seem all the

more tragic. You're getting

married and here I am...

100.

NANA

Zoe.

ZOE

Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really

happy for you.

NANA

I'm worried about you, honey.

ZOE

I'm fine.

NANA

I just don't want you to make the

same mistakes I made. I've been

alone for over thirty years now,

and that's too long. Sometimes in

life you have to forgive and move

on.

ZOE

Are you talking about my father or

Stan?

NANA

Both, baby.

NANA (V.O.)

Because if you don't learn how to

forgive, you will always be stuck

in the past.

101.

BOBBY

(singing)

I see trees of green, red roses

too. I see them bloom for me and

you...

MONA

This song always makes me cry.

ZOE

Me, too.

MONA

Is it happy or sad? The words are

happy but the song is so sad.

ZOE

I guess it's both.   Happy and sad.

BOBBY

(singing)

I see skies of blue and clouds of

white. The bright blessed day, the

dark and sacred night...

MONA

I'm sorry about the things I said.

ZOE

I know.

102.

MONA

It was really shitty of me.

ZOE

It was. Especially because you

were right.

BOBBY

(singing)

And I think to myself...what a

wonderful world...

ZOE

I don't want to be alone forever,

Mona.

MONA

Then don't be.

CUSTOMER

Is this new? The Zoe?

STAN

Yeah. This is the first week it's

been out.

CUSTOMER

Can I have a sample?     What's it

like?

STAN

It's...very stubborn, overly

suspicious and distrustful of men.

CUSTOMER

Huh?

BOBBY

Come on, you old maid.

103.

ZOE

No.

BOBBY

Dance with me. One dance.

ZOE

Forget it.

BOBBY

Fine. But it doesn't mean that I

won't dance with you.

ZOE

What?

BOBBY

Haaaaaay.

ZOE

Go away, you freak.

BOBBY

Smack it, Bitch.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

You know you love it. Uh-huh.

That's right. Smack it.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

What the hell?

104.

OLD MAN

Damn it. Not again.

(then, checks pants)

Nope. Not me.

ZOE

I think my water just broke.

ZOE

I'll drive.

NANA

You're in labor.   You can't drive.

ARTHUR

I'll drive.

NANA

You don't have a car or a license.

(then, to Bobby)

You drive.

BOBBY

We're in Queens. I don't even know

what side of the road they drive on

here.

ZOE

Will someone please just drive me

to the fucking hospital?

MONA

This was my surprise for after the

wedding, but let's hit it.

BOBBY

This works.

105.

NANA

Are you okay? Remember to breathe.

Breathe in, breathe out, breathe

in.

MONA

Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee.

NANA

(joining in)

Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee...

MONA/NANA

Hoo-hoo.   Hee-hee...

ZOE

Please stop. It's getting really

breathy in here. I'm fine.

BOBBY

What about me? I have amniotic

fluid on my Gucci tux.

ARTHUR

Who needs a drink?

NANA

(whispering)

Bobby...

BOBBY

What?

106.

NANA

I don't know if I can do this.

BOBBY

What?!

NANA

I can't go in with her.

BOBBY

Well, I certainly can't do it.   I

don't do vaginas.

ARTHUR

Don't look at me.

NANA

Help me, Bobby.

BOBBY

Nana, pull yourself together. This

is the biggest moment of Zoe's

life, and you can't let her down.

I'd slap you right now, but I'm

afraid your teeth would fly out.

ZOE

Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee, hoo-hee.

Bobby enters, all sweetness and light.

BOBBY

Hey, girl.     How ya doing?

ZOE

Okay.

BOBBY

Good.

(smiles, then)

So, I really don't want you to

worry, but Nana just passed out at

the nurse's station and is now down

in the ER getting stitches.

107.

ZOE

What???

BOBBY

Everything's under control. Good

thing we're at the hospital, right?

ZOE

Where is she?

BOBBY

Get back in bed. All is well.

Arthur's with her. Now, on to

bigger and better...who do you want

to be your birthing partner? Your

choices are me or Mona.

BOBBY (CONT'D)

I know. They're shitty choices.

Do you want me to call your scary

lesbian friends from your group?

ZOE

I don't know.

BOBBY

We're going to get through this,

okay? You just have to really

think about it. Who do you want

with you in the delivery room?

BOBBY (CONT'D)

Who is the one person you want by

your side?

ZOE

Taxi!

108.

CABBIE

You're not an escaped mental

patient, are you?

ZOE

Kind of.

ZOE

Ow.   Son of a bitch, that hurts.

OLIVIA

Are you okay?

OLIVIA (CONT'D)

Are you in labor?

ZOE

Fuck off.

ZOE

Stan!

FRED

Whoa. I've had nightmares that

started like this.

109.

ZOE

Stan!

STAN

Zoe?

ZOE

Stan!

STAN

Are you okay? Don't run!

ZOE

I can't help it!

STAN

Are you all right?

ZOE

(panting)

Great. I'm great.

STAN

Why are you in a hospital gown?

ZOE

I'm in labor.

STAN

What?   What the hell are you doing

here?

ZOE

It's you.

STAN

What?

ZOE

Nana's my birthing partner, but she

passed out and needed stitches, and

Bobby asked me who I most wanted

with me, and...it's you. It's only

you.

(then)

I don't want to be alone anymore.

I love you. You don't know how

much I love you.

110.

ZOE (CONT'D)

More than anything in the world, I

love you.

STAN

I've been in love with you since

the moment you stole my cab.

ZOE

Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab,

hee-hee, hoo-hoo.

ZOE (CONT'D)

Ow.   Ow.   Ow.

STAN

I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just

love you. I love you so much.

(then)

Let's get the hell out of here.

ZOE

Yeah. I think I really need to go

to the hospital now.

STAN

Let's go have our babies.

111.

WOMAN

Hi.

ZOE

Hi.

STAN

Hi.

ZOE

Who knew you were such a romantic.

112.

STAN

Well, it's the anniversary of our

first date. Where else would I

take you?

(then)

Cheers.

STAN (CONT'D)

What a year, huh?

ZOE

Incredible. Wouldn't change a

thing. Well, except for the part

where you dumped me.

STAN

And the part where you dumped me.

(to the babies)

Girls...Mommy and Daddy were

stupid.

ZOE

(baby-talk)

Yes, we were. Yes, we were.

STAN

The first time we held hands was in

here. It started out as a high-

five, but then I strategically

turned into a hand-hold.

ZOE

How do you remember that?

STAN

We both agreed that we were totally

sick of weddings and hated when

people wrote their own vows.

ZOE

That's right. I remember that.

STAN

So...I hope you won't hold it

against me.

ZOE

What?

113.

ZOE (CONT'D)

What are you doing here?

ZOE (CONT'D)

Bobby?

ZOE (CONT'D)

What's happening?

DISSOLVE TO:

STAN

I promise to love you even though

you still eat chicken McNuggets in

bed. I promise to name cheeses

after all of our children no matter

how embarrassed they are by it. I

promise to always check out your

ass when you walk away, and I

promise to love you more tomorrow

than I do today, which doesn't even

seem impossible...

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
