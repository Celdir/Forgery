Your father has work to do, Sonny

Don't worry. I'll beat 'em off

I'm here, Mase. Where are you

STORM

On the Harbor ... south of Torrance.

I got Calabrese right in my

If I had a Sidewinder missile, I

the radio, partner.

I know you, Calabrese. But who are

CALABRESE

-- Murder is a serious business, my

SHADOW MAN WITH HAT

You'll be well compensated,

Calabrese. Money now -- and a lot

more when I get into that office.

You can take that to the bank.

CALABRESE

Slowly ... slowly. Always with

caution.

SHADOW MAN WITH HAT

I'm up to here with caution! That

fuck lives on bean curd and alfalfa

sprouts -- he ain't gonna die of

natural causes.

CALABRESE

All I'm counseling is a little

patience. The man is public. He's

in the paper every day.

SHADOW MAN WITH HAT

Yeah? Well, the next time I read

about him, it better be in the

obituaries.

BAREHEADED SHADOW MAN

Enough bullshit. Can you do the

job or not? If you can't -

What's going down?

STORM

Calabrese. I just got his ass --

KARL

You're full of shit!

STORM

Him and his gorilla Vitale. I got

film and audio on both of them,

laying out a hit. Two other guys I

couldn't make out, but I'm sure

they'll come up on the film. This

is a big one, Carlito. Our own

academy award. You ready?

KARL

(taking notes)

Shoot.

STORM

I want you to track down Morgensteen

right now. If he's with that meter

maid from Pico, crank her legs apart

and pry him out of there.

KARL

He ain't gonna be happy.

STORM

Screw his happiness. Tell him I

want the lab open at six-thirty

tomorrow morning. I want this film

pushed to the max, and nobody but

us to know about it. I know we got

something here.

KARL

You bringing it in tonight?

I'll be at the lab before dawn.

O'Malley, please help me.
