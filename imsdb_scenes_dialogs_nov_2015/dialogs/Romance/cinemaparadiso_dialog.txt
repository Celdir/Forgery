MARIA

...Salvatore, that's right,

Salvatore. Di Vita Salvatore

...But, miss, what do you mean you

don't know him?!...I...Yes...

(She gives a nervous sigh.

She has dialed her way

through endless numbers

but still hasn't managed

to speak to Mr. Di

Vita. She finally heaves a

sigh of relief.)

...That's right, good for you!

Oh!...yes...And I'm his

mother. I'm calling from Sicily. Been

trying all day...Ah, he's not

there...But would you be so kind as

to give me...?...Yes...

(She nods at another woman

around forty sitting

nearby: it is LIA, her

daughter, who jots down

the numbers her

mother dictates:)

...Six, five, six, two, two, oh,

six...Thanks ever so

much...Goodbye. Goodbye.

LIA

Look, Ma...It's useless calling him.

He'll be terribly busy, God knows

where he is. Besides he might not

even remember. Do as I say, forget

it...He hasn't been here for thirty

years. You know how he is.

MARIA

He'll remember! He'll remember!

(She puts on her glasses

and starts dialing

the number.)

...I'm positive. I know him better

than you do. If he were to find

out we hadn't told him, he'd be

angry. I know.

(She takes off her

glasses.)

...Hello? Good morning. Could I

please speak to Mr. Salvatore Di

Vita. I'm his mother...

BOY

Hey! What the fuck you looking at!?

CLARA

Salvatore...But what time is it?

SALVATORE

It's late, Clara. Sorry, but I wasn't

able to let you know I wouldn't be

corning...

(He fondles her, but he is

tired, feels like

sleeping.)

Go to sleep now. Sleep.

CLARA

Your mother phoned. She took me for

somebody else...

SALVATORE

(Surprised)

And what'd you tell her?

CLARA

I played dumb, so as not to

disappoint her. We had a nice little

talk. She says you never go see her,

and when she wants to see you she has

to come to Rome...Is it true?

SALVATORE

She phoned just to say that?

CLARA

She said a certain Alfredo had died.

And the funeral's taking place

tomorrow afternoon...

(A strange look suddenly

comes into SALVATORE'S

eyes. The idea of going to

sleep has clearly left

him. It's a piece of news

he didn't expect. That's

taken him off-guard. CLARA

would like to carry on the

conversation, but

sleepiness makes

it almost impossible. An

she can manage is one last

question in a faint little

voice:)

Who is it? A relative of yours?

SALVATORE

No. Sleep. Go to sleep.

PRIEST

Pss! Pssst!

Cut to:

PRIEST

But how can I make you understand?

Without the bell I just can't go on!

Always half asleep, you are! What do

you do at night anyway? Eat instead

of sleep?

SALVATORE

Father, at my house we don't even eat

at noon. That's why I'm always

sleepy. That's what the vet says.

PRIEST

All right, Toto, get moving, I've got

things to do. Say hello to your

mother.

SALVATORE

Can I...

PRIEST

(Interrupting him)

And don't ask if you can come...

Because you can't!! Shoo, shoo, off

with you!!

PRIEST

OK, Alfredo, you can start!!

ALFREDO

(Harshly, shouting)

You must not come here! How many

times do I have to tell you?

(And he slows down the

reels with his hand. The

slips of paper

are about to arrive.

Here's the first.)

If the film catches fire, runt that

you are, you'd go up in a

burst of flame...whoosh! And turn

into a piece of...

SALVATORE

(Overlapping him)

...and turn into a piece of

charcoal!!

ALFREDO

(Angrily)

Christ, that's a sassy little tongue

you've got! Watch out, or someday

I'll snip it off.

SALVATORE

Can I have it?

ALFREDO

No!!! Are you deaf or something? I've

got to put this back in when we wind

up the film again! You're a real pain

in the neck!

SALVATORE

Then why didn't you put these back

when you wound up the films again?

ALFREDO

'Cause sometimes you can't find the

right place any more and so...well,

actually...they stay here.

(Finding an excuse)

Besides, there are more kisses than

you can count.

SALVATORE

(Excited)

So I can have these?

(ALFREDO explodes, flies

off the handle. He grabs

SALVATORE by the shoulders

and shakes him.)

ALFREDO

Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass

all the way to China and back, let's

make a deal. These strips here are

yours, I give them to you. However!

One  you're not to stick your nose in

here any more. Two  I'll keep them

for you, because you can't take them

home for God forbid and save our

souls, if they catch fire, all hell

will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now

scram!

SALVATORE

What sort of deal is this? The strips

are mine! So why can't I come see

them?

ALFREDO

Get out!! And don't show your face

here again!

SALVATORE

Bang! Bang! Bang! Shoot first, think

later! This is no job for weaklings!

Treacherous dog!

SALVATORE

Hey there, you lousy bastard, take

your hands off that gold, You black-

hearted pig, stay away from me, or

I'll smash your face in!

'Ntantatah!!!...

(In the heap of movie

frames there are also

several photographs.

SALVATORE picks them up.

Family keepsakes. A man in

an army uniform. Then the

same man with a girl

beside him whose smiling

face can be recognized as

MARIA. SALVATORE takes a

closer look at the man's

face, then whispers to his

mother:)

Ma, if the war's over, how come

Daddy's never come back?

MARIA

He'll be back, he'll be back...

You'll see. One of these

days...

SALVATORE

I don't remember him any moreMa,

where's Russia?

MARIA

It takes years to get there. And

years to come back...Now go to bed,

Toto, it's late.

MASINO'S FATHER

You can fool your mother but not me!

Get yourself a damn diploma and

become a policeman. You good-for-

nothing!

MASINO

I don't want to go to school'

(The sound of the bell.

The black lines move up

the steps towards the

school.)

TEACHER

Well then?! Five times five

equals...?

COLA

Thirty!

TEACHER

Silence!!

(Then to COLA)

The five times table. Dunce! One

times five, five!!

(The class repeats with

the TEACHER, in a sing-

song chorus:)

TEACHER and CLASS

Two times five, ten! Three times

five, fifteen! Four times five,

twenty!

(With a wave of the rod,

the TEACHER silences the

class, and finishes the

sing-song with the fateful

question.)

TEACHER

Five times five?

COLA

(Timidly)

Forty...?

TEACHER

I'm asking you for the last time,

blockhead! Five times five equals...?

(COLA turns to her with

smiling eyes and answers

blissfully:)

COLA

Christmas!!

ALFREDO

(Sternly)

What are you doing here?

SALVATORE

I bought a ticket. I've come to see

the film.

(Meanwhile the USHER comes

up behind him and grabs

him by the collar, and he

almost jumps out of his

skin. ALFREDO laughs.)

USHER

(Yelling)

Go sit downstairs! You good-for-

nothing sponger! !

(To the audience)

Worse than rabbits they are!

FIRST OLD MAN

Hello, everybody!

AUDIENCE

(At once)

Ssssssh!!! Ssssssh! Silence!

FIRST OLD MAN

Can't I say hello?

USHER

It's a double-feature today.

FIRST OLD MAN

I couldn't care less. I come here to

sleep.

AUDIENCE

(Hooting and whistling)

For Christ's sake! Cut it,

Alfredoooo!

CHILDREN

Grrrr! Grrrrr!

SECOND OLD MAN

Greetings to one and all!

AUDIENCE

SSSSSH' Drop dead! Silence! Hey,

kids, we're here to see the film!

AUDIENCE

(Disappointed)

Ahhh! What a shame! I've been going

to the movies for twenty years and I

never saw a kiss!

AUDIENCE

And when will we see one?

VOICE and AUDIENCE

Bugger!!! Ssssh!!! Silence!!

MARIA

I've been looking for you all day.

Did you buy the milk?

SALVATORE

No...

MARIA

Then where's the money?

SALVATORE

Somebody stole it.

MARIA

What'd you do with the money? Go to

the movies?

ALFREDO

Signora Maria, don't do that. He's

just a kid.

(To SALVATORE)

And why are you telling fibs?

(To MARIA)

We let him in free. He must have lost

the money inside the movie

theatre...

(SALVATORE stares at him

in amazement, goes on

listening to him.)

How much did you have?

SALVATORE

Fifty lire...

(MARIA wipes away his tears.)

ALFREDO

(To the USHER)

What you find tonight on the floor

between the seats?

(The USHER reaches into-

his pockets, pulls out

some odds and ends.)

USHER

A comb, two heel-savers, a box of

tobacco...

(ALFREDO very skillfully

reaches out with fifty

lire he has taken

from his pocket. And like

a magician he draws the

money out of

the USHER'S hand.)

ALFREDO

...and fifty lire!

(To MARIA)

See?

(He hands over the money

under the USHER'S

astonished eyes.)

MARIA

Thanks, Uncle Alfredo. Thanks. Good-

night.

IDIOT

It's midnight. I've got to shut down

the square! Go away.

The square's mine! The square's

mine!!

Cut to:

ALFREDO

Good morning, father. It's hard on

the feet, huh?

PRIEST

(Breathless)

Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and

all the saints help you. But coming

back! The saints stand there watching

you, that's all! God's will be done.

SALVATORE

Ouch! Ouch! My foot! I can't walk!

Cut to:

SALVATORE

Alfredo, did you know my father?

ALFREDO

Of course I knew your father. He was

tall, thin, pleasant, and had a

moustache like mine. Always smiling.

He looked like Clark Gable.

SALVATORE

Alfredo, now that I'm older, I'm not

saying I can start coming to the

projection booth, to the movie

house...But...maybe, why don't we

become friends?

ALFREDO

'I choose my friends for their

looks, and my enemies for their

brains...'

(Laughs)

You're too smart to be my friend.

Besides, as I always tell my kids, be

careful to pick the right friends!

SALVATORE

(Surprised)

But you don't have any kids!!!

ALFREDO

(Spluttering)

All right, all right! When I've got

kids that's what I'm telling them!

(The outlying houses of

Giancaldo finally heave

into sight.)

MARIA

Stop crying...The fire is out...I'm

here...That'll do, that'll do...

(ALFREDO and SALVATORE

come up behind them.

SALVATORE has barely leapt

off the bicycle when his

mother sails into him like

a fury, shrieking:)

Miserable boy! You're the ruin of me!

Your sister would have been burnt

alive if I hadn't been there! And all

your fault!

MARIA

But aren't you ashamed of yourself,

Uncle Alfredo, playing with a little

boy at your age?!

ALFREDO

(Cowed)

But...what's it got to do with

me?...

MARIA

And who gave him all those films?

Promise you won't give him any more

of this trash! Don't let him set foot

any more in the movie house. The

boy's crazy! Crazy! All he talks

about is movies and Alfredo' Alfredo

and movies!!

ALFREDO

I give you my word, Donna Maria.

(MARIA now turns one last

time to her son.)

MARIA

God's got to grant me one wish! Send

your father back home! And he'll see

you get what's coming to you!

(SALVATORE lowers his

hands, looks at her and

with the dreadful

sincerity of children:)

SALVATORE

Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.

(An icy flash runs through

MARIA'S eyes.)

MARIA

It's not true! No! It's not true!!!

I'll show you he's coming back!

BLACKSMITH

Ah! I'll wring all your necks!! Or my

good name means nothing! !! Lousy

brats!

SALVATORE

Signora Anna!

SALVATORE

(On the defensive)

Your wife told me to bring you this.

ALFREDO

(Sternly)

Give it to me!...

SALVATORE

I told my mother you weren't the one

who gave me the films. That it

wasn't your fault. But I thought you

said the film could catch fire just

to scare me. Now that I know, I won't

steal any more from you. That's all I

wanted to say. I'm going.

(He turns to leave but

ALFREDO takes him by the

shoulder and stops

him.)

ALFREDO

Toto, come here.

ALFREDO

Now listen to what I've got to say. I

took up this profession when I

was ten years old. In those days

there weren't these modern machines.

The films were silent. The projectors

were run by hand, like this, with a

crank. And you wound the crank all

day long. It was really rough going!

If you got tired and slowed down'

boom! Everything would go up in

flames!

SALVATORE

Then why don't you want to teach it

to me too? Now that there's no more

cranking, and it's easier?

ALFREDO

(Firmly)

Because I don't want to, Toto! This

is not a job for you. It's like being

a slave. You're always alone. You see

the same film over and over again,

because you have nothing else to do.

And you start talking to Greta Garbo

and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work

on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter.

Only on Good Friday are you free. But

if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a

cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!

SALVATORE

Then why don't you change jobs?

(ALFREDO sighs, irritated.

He reaches out to turn the

knob of the carbon rods.

He gazes at SALVATORE as

if he were a grown-up,

somebody who's making

things hard for him.)

ALFREDO

Because I'm an idiot. How many other

guys in town know how to be a

projectionist? None! Only a jerk like

me could do it. Besides I wasn't

lucky. When I was a kid there was the

war! When I grew up, another war! Now

it's all different. Times have

changed. And you want to be a dope

like me? Huh? Answer me!

SALVATORE

No...

ALFREDO

Good for you, Toto. Good for you...

I'm only saying this for your own

good...

(He gets up and, speaking

all the while, goes into a

closet with a bucket

in it, the toilet of the

booth. He turns his back

and pees. )

Cooped up in here you die of heat in

the summer and of cold in the winter.

You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and

earn practically nothing.

(SALVATORE listens to

him, but taking advantage

of the fact he can't be

seen, he turns the knob of

the carbon rods, just as

he had seen done a moment

before...)

SALVATORE

(In a loud voice)

But don't you like anything about

what you do?

(SALVATORE gazes at the

photos on the wall:

Keaton, Garbo, Snow

White. ALFREDO

smiles to himself. Sure,

there's something about

that damn job he likes:)

ALFREDO

With time...you get used to it.

Besides, when you hear from up here

that there's a full house and that

people are laughing, having fun...

Then you're happy too.

(ALFREDO is lost in

thought, doesn't notice

that the documentaries

and cartoons have

finished. The screen is

blank. And down in the

theatre laughter is not

heard but an uproar of

whistling and

swearing. SALVATORE'S eyes

sparkle, he seizes the

opportunity.

He turns on the lights and

stops the projector, just

as ALFREDO

would have done. At which

ALFREDO buttons up his

pants in a

hurry and rushes over

alarmed, but sees that

everything is in order.

SALVATORE looks at him all

smiles, as if he expected

a medal for

civil bravery. Instead,

ALFREDO reacts like a wild

animal.)

So I've been wasting my breath? You

pretend to agree with

me, but as soon as my back is turned,

you do what you want!

(He gives SALVATORE a kick

in the ass, shrieking:)

Get out of here! I don't want to lay

eyes on you again! This is

the last straw! Your mother's right,

you're crazy!!

(He pushes him towards the

stairs. SALVATORE suddenly

vanishes, scared out of

his wits. ALFREDO talks to

himself, in a

fury:)

But how'd he do it? The little

bastard! By watching, he's

learned! It's incredible!

(He peers out of the

window, yelling, as he

sees SALVATORE

running through the

square. )

I'm letting the box office know

you're not to set foot even into

the theatre! There are no more

tickets for you! And I'm also

talking to Father Adelfio! You won't

be an altar boy any more

either!!! You little runt!

(SALVATORE looks at him.

Hates him. Yells something

offensive:)

SALVATORE

Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!!

(But his words are drowned

out by the sudden shouting

of the people outside the

cafe.)

CROWD

Goal!! Holy Mother of God!!!

(A MAN in the crowd

crumples to the ground.

The others swarm around

him, alarmed. They hold up

his head. His face is

pale. They check the

coupon he is clutching in

his hand. A voice rises

like a siren from the

crowd.)

MAN

Ciccio Spaccafico's won the

Sisal!!!!!

(The yell can be heard...)

SPECTATOR'S VOICE

The Neapolitan's won the lottery!!!

Let's go see, kids!!! Northerners are

always lucky!

(The whole audience leaps

up and heads for the exit.

Pushing. Shouting.

Laughing and Joking. )

EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER

A merchant owns two stores. In the

first he sells fruit and vegetables.

In the second he sells nails and

cement...

(The PRINCIPAL comes in,

interrupts the dictation.)

PRINCIPAL

Excuse me, professor. Here are the

men taking the exam for the

elementary school certificate.

(Turning to the door)

Come in, please...

(All the children turn to

look. A MAN around thirty

enters, ill at ease. The

children recognize him and

laugh mischievously. The

second is the BLACKSMITH,

the one who falls asleep

at the movies. The third

is a twenty-year-old-boy,

ANGELO. The fourth is

ALFREDO, embarrassed and

red in the face. SALVATORE

is speechless. Gives a

slightly ironic laugh.

There is a look of revenge

in his shrewd little

eyes.)

Cut to:

ALFREDO

YOU jerk. Tell me how to solve this

fucking problem!

TEACHER

Ssssh! Silence back there!!

MAIN FLOOR VOICE

Bastard!! Pencil-pusher!!

ALFREDO

Pay attention. This is where it can

easily catch fire. If it

happens, the first thing you've got

to do is break it off, here

and here, so the whole reel doesn't

go up in fames.

ALFREDO

You understand which side the

gelatin's on?

SALVATORE

It tastes wonderful!

AUDIENCE

Fraaaame!! Wake up, Alfredo!

(SALVATORE tries to do a

hand-binding. ALFREDO

winds the film, hangs a

slip on a nail in the

wall.)

ALFREDO

These are the shipping invoices for

the film. They are always to be kept.

You see?

SALVATORE

OK, Alfredo.

AUDIENCE

Holy Mother! What a face! So ugly!

ALFREDO

Now you can run it by yourself.

MASINO

(In a whisper)

Christ, what a piece of ass!!!

TEACHER

Di Francesco, aren't you saying

goodbye to your schoolmate?

(DI FRANCESCO gives his

head a little shake. The

TEACHER leans over to

him.)

But why?

(DI FRANCESCO whispers,

almost into her ear.)

DI FRANCESCO

My father says he's a Communist...

SALVATORE

Will they really find work in

Germany?

ALFREDO

Who knows?...It's like an adventure.

(In a theatrical voice)

Hope springs eternal...

(PEPPINO from the distance

gives one last wave at the

window of the

projection booth.

SALVATORE waves back.)

SALVATORE

Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!

(The black car drives off,

leaving a cloud of dust

that envelops the

suppressed sobs of the

grandparents standing

there waving

handkerchiefs. SALVATORE

watches the car drive off.

He mumbles:)

Good thing Germany's closer than

Russia.

COMMENTATOR

The Defense Minister has announced a

new listof names of Italian soldiers,

so far considered missing and now

confirmed as dead. Families concerned

will be notified directly by military

authorities.

OFFICIAL

...Unfortunately we don't know what

war cemetery he's buried in...This

is the form for the pension. If you'd

like to sign it...

PRIEST

Don't shove! There's no room! For

heaven's sake! I can't

give another showing, it's late!

VOICES IN CROWD

Father Adelfio, we've been here for

an hour! There are people inside

who've seen it twice! ! ! Move on!!

Ouch!! My foot!!!

CROWD

Open up!!! Father Adelfio!!

(The audience in the

theatre hears the uproar.

Reacts:)

AUDIENCE

Ssssh! Sssssh! Be quiet out there!!

What the hell!

(From the window of the

projection booth, ALFREDO

and SALVATORE look at the

crowd down below, yelling

and complaining. Some of

the people look up at

them. )

VOICES IN CROWD

Alfredooo! We want to get in!...

Tomorrow you're taking it off!

(ALFREDO spreads his arms

out as if to say there s

nothing he can do.)

SALVATORE

Why can't we show the same film

tomorrow?

ALFREDO

It's got to be sent to another town.

And if we don't the owner of that

movie house gets pissed off.

SALVATORE

Too bad!

CARABINIERES

(Exasperated)

Stop! Go home, all of you! Otherwise

somebody's going to end up in jail!'

That's enough!

ALFREDO

(Dramatically)

'Joe! A mob doesn't think, doesn't

know what it's doing...'

(SALVATORE gives him a

curious, inquisitive look.

ALFREDO smiles.)

Spencer Tracy said it in Fury.

(Mischievously)

What'd you say if we let these poor

devils see the film, Toto?

(SALVATORE stares at him

in amazement, all

excited.)

SALVATORE

Wonderful! But how can it be done?

ALFREDO

You don't believe my words, but

you'll have to believe your own

eyes!...And now get your ass off

that damn stool, boy!

ALFREDO

(Mysteriously)

Go to the window, boy, and have a

look...

SALVATORE

Alfredo, it's beautiful.

(A voice is heard in the

crowd of people jammed

around the entrance to the

movie house.)

VOICE IN CROWD

(Shouting)

Hey, look there!! The movie!!

(All heeds turn to look at

the house behind them.)

CROWD

Oh, praise the Lord!! It's true!

Look! The movie!! There's Toto!!

Hurry! Hurry!...THANKS, ALFRED0000!!

SALVATORE

Good for you, Alfredo!

CROWD

Shut the window!! Shut the window! Go

to bed!!

VOICES IN CROWD

(To ALFREDO)

Sound!!! Sound!! Alfredooooo!!

ALFREDO

What do you say, should we make them

happy?

SALVATORE

(Smiling)

Sure, sure!

CROWD

Aaaaaaaa! At last!

ALFREDO

(Looking at SALVATORE)

Do you want to go down there?

(SALVATORE gives a

contented nod.)

Go on.

TICKET-SELLER

Ladies and gentlemen! You have to buy

tickets! Reduced rate!

CROWD

Fuck off!! The square belongs to

everybody!

(The VILLAGE IDIOT peers

Out Of the crowd, all

worked up.)

VILLAGE IDIOT

No!!! The square's mine!!! Come on,

kids, no joking around here!!!

Otherwise...

CROWD

Heeeelp! Run for your lives!!!

SALVATORE

Alfredo! Heeeelp! Help!!!

VOICES

What a pity! Poor Alfredo! What a

terrible thing!! Cheer up, Father, is

there something we can do?'

VILLAGE IDIOT

(Laughing)

Burnt up...Burnt up.

PRIEST

What'll we do now! The town will have

to get along without movies! Who's

got the money to rebuild it?

GUESTS

Cheers' Congratulations, Don Ciccio!

AUDIENCE

To the Cinema Paradiso!

PRIEST

How'd you solve his being under age?

SPACCAFICO

I took out a license as

projectionist, thanks to friends down

at the guild offices. But I don't

know a thing about it. Officially, I

do the job...

(Smiling at Salvatore)

...but Toto earns the money.

PRIEST

Fine.

(To SALVATORE)

Always be careful, my boy. Don't ever

go to sleep. Be sure another accident

doesn't happen. Do everything poor

Alfredo taught you. And may God bless

you.

MARIA

Thanks, Father. Thanks.

SPACCAFICO

And now enough of this gloomy

atmosphere. Life goes on! I want to

see you happy and smiling!

AUDIENCE

Ooooooh! They're kissing!! Look at

that!! Christ, that's news!!

ANNA'S VOICE

Toto?...

ALFREDO

Any room for me in this Cinema

Paradiso?

(SALVATORE runs over and

embraces him.)

SALVATORE

Come in, Alfredo.

ANNA

(to SALVATORE)

Toto, will you bring him home when

you close down?

SALVATORE

Yes. Signora Anna.

(To ALFREDO)

I'm glad you came.

Cut to:

ALFREDO

How's school?

SALVATORE

OK. OK. But now that I've got a job,

I'11 probably stop going...

ALFREDO

Don't do that...Sooner or later

you'll be left empty-handed.

SALVATORE

Why? What do you mean?

ALFREDO

Toto, this isn't for you. For the

moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs

you, and you need the Cinema

Paradiso. But it won't last...Some

day you'll have other things

to do, more important things...

(He reaches out and

touches SALVATORE'S face

to 'feel' his expression.)

That's right, more important. I know

it. Now that I've lost my sight I see

more.

I see everything I didn't see

before...

(As ALFREDO moves his hand

from SALVATORE's face, we

see that he is now a young

man, and that ALFREDO is

older, grayer.)

And it's all thanks to you, who saved

my life. And I'll never forget it...

(SALVATORE doesn't

understand his strange

words. ALFREDO can 'feel'

he is troubled.)

And don't put on that look. I haven't

gone off my head yet. You want proof?

SALVATORE

(Smiling)

Yes. I want proof.

ALFREDO

For example, at this moment the

film's out of focus. Go see.

ALFREDO

(Smiling)

It's hard to explain, Toto...

SPACCAFICO

Only two days? Are you joking?!...

What do I care if all the copies

are reserved?...Catene for only two

days in a place like this! Why,

people will eat me alive!...

(Standing beside him

listening is SALVATORE. He

is carrying school

books under his ann. In

the cafe, several curious

ONLOOKERS laugh as through

the cafe window they watch

some unemployed PEASANT

MEN dancing together at

the club. SPACCAFICO

listens nervously, then

shrieks as if he were

about to eat the phone.)

...I know, I know. But even if I

start showing at eight in the morning

it wouldn't be enough! This is a big

town now and you people at the

Titanus know it perfectly well! I'm

your sole agent and if I get pissed

off I'll write straight

to Lombardo, in Rome!! I'll give you

guys a good run-around!! If I get my

dander up, I can let fly, if my

name's Spaccafico!!

Cut to:

SALVATORE

Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You

remember that old abandoned movie

house where they're supposed to build

those low-rent houses?

SPACCAFICO

So what's that got to do with it?

SALVATORE

The projector's all rusty, but I

could fix it in two or three days.

Give the place a good cleaning, put

in some seats and bring in a

projectionist and we'll show Catene

in two houses.

SPACCAFICO

(Shrieking)

What the fuck you talking about? You

getting into the act too, Toto?

Titanus has trouble giving me even

one copy and I have to say thanks! If

I ask for two, the least they'll do

is cut off my head and play ball with

it!

SALVATORE

Who says we need two copies?

USHER

(Exasperate])

That's enough now! You've seen it ten

times! I need the seats! I wish you'd

all get the galloping runs!

CARABINIERES

Easy! Easy! Through the emergency

exits, quick! Stop the jabbering!!

SALVATORE

Now get running and bring me the

first reel. Meanwhile I'll start

showing the news!

BOCCIA

OK, Toto!

SPACCAFICO

Quick! Give it to me! Here's the

first part. Get moving!

SPACCAFICO

Here you are! Quick, quick!! People

are waiting!

FADE.

FADE.

FADE.

AUDIENCE

Hey, when's it starting!! We've got

ploughing to do in the morning!!

Toto, get a move on!! Heeey!!

CARABINIERE

What are we going to do, Toto? The

whole place here is up in arms.

They've been waiting more than a half

hour.

SALVATORE

What can I do?

SPACCAFICO

Where's the fucking bastard got to?

SPECTATOR

Let's get one thing straight, Don

Ciccio! I'm waiting ten minutes

more, and if you haven't started...

you're giving me my money back!!

AUDIENCE

(In chorus)

Well said! Well said! We want our

money back!!

SPACCAFICO

Easy! Easy! What about my showing you

the first part again? Huh?

AUDIENCE

No! First part, my foot! We want to

see how the story ends!!

PASQUALE

I've seen the whole works! You want

me to tell you how it ends?

AUDIENCE

Nooo! No! Shut up, you jerk!!

SALVATORE

Boccia! Boccia!

SALVATORE

(Alarmed)

Boccia, what's wrong?

(He runs over to help his

friend. Behind the bush he

discovers BOCCIA humped up

between the legs of

TERESA, a prostitute. He

moves with all the fury

of his young years.

SALVATORE has never seen

people making love before

and is speechless.)

Damn you, what are you doing?

BOCCIA

(Shouting)

Oh, Christ, it's so good!!!

(And he goes on ramming it

home.)

TERESA

Hey, cut it out! Go away. Shoo!

SALVATORE

What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch

fire!

ALFREDO

Progress! It always arrives too late!

Fade to:

TERESA'S VOICE

(Off-screen)

Come on...That's right...relax...

(Laughing)

...Don't be scared...

SALVATORE'S VOICE

(Off-screen)

Is it true that if I bleed I've got

to squeeze lemon juice on it?

TERESA'S VOICE  (Off-screen)

(A loud laugh)

Lemon juice?...That's a new one for

you! Who tells you this crap...Take

it easy...That's right...You see,

it's not painful, is it?

TERESA

...There you are! That's right,

that's right! Keep going...

(SALVATORE is quicker, has

learned the lesson. TERESA

goads him on.)

Ah!!! There, now you're a real man! A

man! ? A real calf!

(SALVATORE's panting

slackens into a deep sigh

of pleasure.)

SALVATORE

You know that one there?

BOCCIA

She's new. Not bad though. Nice-

looking.

(SALVATORE has the look of

somebody seeking for an

idea, some way of picking

up a conversation with

her.)

SECOND STUDENT

Her father s the new bank director.

Loaded, luxury and easy living!

FIRST STUDENT

People who jerk off with a shirt so

they won't get their hands dirty.

(Laughs.)

SALVATORE

Look, you dropped this.

ELENA

Oh, thanks. I hadn't noticed...

SALVATORE

My name's Salvatore...And yours?

ELENA

(Smiling)

Elena. My name's Elena.

SALVATORE

I...I...The other time at the

station.

ALFREDO

Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?

SALVATORE

That's right, Modern Times.

ALFREDO

I've shown it so many times I know it

by heart. The first time I showed

it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first

wife died. They kept it hidden from

me all day so they wouldn't have to

close down the movie house. I only

found out that night, after the last

show. Those are things you never

forget...

(Changing his tone.)

So, Toto, how are these home movies

going?

(SALVATORE has switched on

the little projector and a

square of light appears on

the wall beside ALFREDO,

with the scenes shot in

town.)

SALVATORE

Yes.

(The shots of the

slaughter-house have

appeared.)

ALFREDO

(Whispering)

What is it, what is it? What's the

picture?

SALVATORE

It's people in the slaughter-house

killing a calf. There's blood all

over the floor, like a lake. And

through this lake another calf passes

by on its way to die.

ALFREDO

Now what can you see?

SALVATORE

Nothing, there's nothing. It's all

out of focus.

ALFREDO

(Smiling)

Is there a woman?...Tell me the

truth...

(SALVATORE is shamed,

uncertain, doesn't know

whet to say. A tender look

filters through ALFREDO's

dark glasses. He has

obviously caught on and

whispers:)

There is a woman.

SALVATORE

Yes, it's a girl I saw at the

station.

ALFREDO

What's she like? What's she like?...

SALVATORE

She's nice. My age...Slender, with

long hair, brunette. She had big blue

eyes, a simple expression and a

little beauty mark on her lip, but

really tiny. You can only see it

close-up. And when she smiles...She

makes you feel...

ALFREDO

Eh! Love...what a mystery!

(SALVATORE turns off the

projector and heaves a

deep sigh, almost of

liberation. ALFREDO'S

sympathy does him a lot of

good. It's nice to be

understood. He moves over

closer to him. ALFREDO

runs his hand through his

hair, whispers:)

I understand you, Toto...The ones

with blue eyes are the

most beautiful. Whatever you do, you

can't make friends with

them.

(SALVATORE is comforted by

the way he talks. He

didn't think it

was possible to put into

words the things he has

felt since meeting

ELENA. He nods his head.

ALFREDO sighs.)

Eh, there's nothing to be done about

it! The heavier a man is,

the deeper his footprints. And if

he's in love, he suffers,

because he knows he's up a one-way

street. Because love is a

meaningless thing when a man gets it

into his head to do what

he wants...

(SALVATORE is touched by

his sensitivity, by his

intense, passionate, sweet

way of speaking.)

SALVATORE

What you say is wonderful! But sad...

ALFREDO

(Smiling)

They're not my words. John Wayne said

it in Shepherd of the Hills.

SALVATORE

Stinking two-timer!!

(And they burst out

laughing.)

SALVATORE

Hi, Elena!

ELENA

Hi. Why are you running?

SALVATORE

No particular reason...

(He is entranced by her

eyes. He wants to tell her

all sorts of

things, say all the words

he has memorized a

thousand times. But

now he can't get them out.

His knees tremble. He does

his best to

overcome his confusion,

but all that comes out

is:)

Nice day, huh?

(A gust of wind envelops

them in a cloud of dust

and a clap of

thunder rends the air.

ELENA laughs, amused by

the blunder.)

ELENA

Yes, nice day.

(SALVATORE laughs too. He

gazes at her long hair

tossed by the wind. She

turns to leave.)

...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.

SALVATORE

Bye-bye, Elena.

(ELENA walks away. And

SALVATORE also turns to

leave. Only now is he

seized by disappointment,

regret at not having made

the best of the

opportunity. He talks to

himself.)

...What an idiot! What an idiot!

'Nice day'! Christ!!

SALVATORE

You probably don't believe me, but

I'm going to become the leading man

in your life. Sure, I don't look like

Marlon Brando, but look at me, really

look at me. Am I really so ugly? So

should I try once more? Maybe It'll

succeed. What do you

say?

SALVATORE

Hello, can I speak to Elena, please?

WOMANS VOICE

Yes.

(SALVATORE recognizes

ELENA's voice, changes his

tone, turns sweeter, more

personal.)

SALVATORE

Is that you, Elena?

WOMAN'S VOICE

Yes...

SALVATORE

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize

your voice. This is Salvatore,

remember?

WOMAN'SVOICE

Yes...

SALVATORE

Listen, I know that every time we see

each other I make a fool of myself,

but I'm not like that, I swear. It's

just that when I see you, I feel shy,

the right words don't come to me, I

don't have the courage to say that

all I do is think about you...

(He has finally got it

out. He's dripping with

sweat, but happy at having

succeeded. He continues.)

That's right, Elena, you're the last

thing I think of when I go to sleep

and the first when I wake up in the

morning. And at night I always dream

of you. I know, it's not good on the

phone. But please, don't get me

wrong. Because I love you very

much...

WOMAN'SVOICE

(Interrupting him)

If you don't stop phoning her, I'm

calling the police!

SALVATORE

(Stunned)

But excuse me, who's speaking?

ELENA'S MOTHER

I'm Elena's mother, you filthy pig!

SALVATORE

I'm sorry, Signora, maybe there's a

misunderstanding...I...

WOMAN'S VOICE

And don't call my daughter any more.

Never!

ALFREDO

I told you, the blue-eyed ones are

the most difficult.

SALVATORE

But why? There must be some way to

make her understand!

ALFREDO

Don't think about it, Toto. Don't

even try. With feelings, there's

nothing to understand.

SALVATORE

Stop it! I've had enough of your

sermons! You act as if you created

the world!

(A bicycle streaks by

ALFREDO, who gives a

startled jump, as if it

were about to

run into him. He raises

his voice, panic-

stricken.)

ALFREDO

Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off

with me now! Come here! I don't

know where the fuck I have to go.

(A MAN on a bicycle almost

collides with ALFREDO.

SALVATORE fumes, goes over

to him listlessly. ALFREDO

puts his hand back on his

shoulder and they start

walking again. ALFREDO has

calmed down, but his voice

is determined.)

And the next time be careful how you

talk. Not to take credit away

from the Lord, but if I had created

the world, in all modesty, certain

things would have come out better.

But unfortunately such was not the

case.

SALVATORE

(Laughing)

You see, it s like I say. You always

have an answer for everything.

ALFREDO

I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm

going to tell you a story.

(And he squeezes

SALVATORE'S shoulder. It's

the signal for taking a

rest. They sit in a

doorway. ALFREDO starts

telling his story, and his

way of speaking is

hypnotic, magical. With

those eyes lost in empty

space, it's as if his

thoughts and his words

came in from some other

dimension, mysterious,

hidden...)

Once upon a time a king gave a feast

and there were all the most beautiful

princesses of the realm. Basta, one

of the guards, saw the king's

daughter: she was the loveliest of

all! And he immediately fell in love

with her. But what could a poor

soldier do compared with a king's

daughter?!...One day he managed

to meet her and told her he couldn't

live without her. The princess was so

struck by the depth of his feeling

that she said to the soldier  'If you

will wait a hundred days and a

hundred nights beneath my balcony,

then in the end I'll be yours.'

Christ, the soldier ran off there and

waited! One day, two days,

ten, twenty...Every night she looked

out of her window, but he never

budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never

budged! The birds shat on him and the

bees ate him alive! After ninety

nights he was gaunt and pale and

tears streamed from his eyes but he

couldn't hold them back. He didn't

even have the strength to sleep any

more. The princess kept watch...And

on the ninety-ninth night, the

soldier got up, picked up his chair

and left!

SALVATORE

No! You mean right at the end?

(SALVATORE is amazed,

dumbfounded; that ending

has made a deep

impression. They

start walking again.)

ALFREDO

That's right, Toto, right at the end?

And don't ask me what it means. If

you figure it out, let me know...

SALVATORE

I'll be damned'

PRIEST

What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of

all times!

ALFREDO

(In a grave voice)

Father Adelfio, I have a very serious

doubt that is torturing my soul. And

you've got to help me, because I've

lost all peace of mind...

ELENA

Father, I have sinned...

SALVATORE

(In a low voice)

We'll talk about that later.

ELENA

(Surprised)

But...who...

SALVATORE

(Interrupting her)

Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend

everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.

ELENA

What are you doing here?

PRIEST

But Alfredo, what you're saying is

horrifying!

ALFREDO

I know. But take the-miracle of the

loaves and fishes, for example! I

think about it a lot...How is it

possible for...

ELENA

(Annoyed)

There was a terrible rumpus at home.

My mother told my father. And how

could you have mistaken my voice?!

SALVATORE

Forgive me, Elena. It was stupid of

me. But I had to talk to you.

SALVATORE

You're so beautiful, Elena...That's

what I wanted to tell you. When I

meet you, I can't put two words

together because...you give me the

shivers. I don't know what you do in

these situations, what you're

supposed to say. It's the first time.

But I think I'm in love with you.

OLD WOMAN

Father, I have sinned...

(SALVATORE turns lo her,

instinctively.)

SALVATORE

I absolve you in the name of the

Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

Go in peace, my daughter.

(And he slams the panel

shut in her face. ELENA is

barely able to control her

laughter.)

When you laugh, you're even more

beautiful.

ELENA

Salvatore, it's awfully sweet of you.

And even though I don't know you, I

like you. But...I'm not in love with

you.

SALVATORE

I don't care. I'll wait.

ELENA

For what?

SALVATORE

For you to fall in love with me too.

Listen carefully. Every night, when I

get off work, I'll come and wait

beneath your window. Every night.

When you change your mind, open your

window. That's all. I'll

understand...

PRIEST

(Exhausted)

You understand now? You see it

clearly?

ALFREDO

(Hypocritically)

Oh yes, father. Now everything's

clear.

PRIEST

And the next time don't go around

saying such heresy. You survived the

fire at the movie house. But no one

can save you from the fire of Hell!

Fade to:

Fade to:

Fade to:

Fade to:

MARIA

(Nervously)

But why hasn't Toto shown up? The

movie house is closed at this hour!

ALFREDO

He had to do something for me...

RADIO VOICE

Six, five, four, three, two, one,

zero! Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

ALFREDO

(To Maria)

There's nothing to worry about. He's

probably with his friends.

(To all)

Let's toast!

EVERYBODY

(Toasting)

Here's to you! Here's to you! Happy

New Year!

MARIA

For Toto too, here's to you!! Happy

New Year! !

ELENA

Salvatore...

ELENA

(Ironically)

You have a great future as a driver.

If they don't arrest you first!!

SALVATORE

That's nothing to do with it, it's

the car that's still being run in...

ELENA

SO now how do we get home?

Cut to:

SALVATORE

Hello, Dr Mendola...Hem...

ALFREDO

(In a low voice)

Toto, are you pulling my leg or

something? How is it possible to see

this television without film?

SALVATORE

Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any.

And if you buy a television set, you

can watch it at home, without any

fuss...

ALFREDO

(Sceptically)

Could be...But I don't like this

business. It smells fishy to me.

SPACCAFICO

(In a low voice)

You see what a bright idea, Dr

Mendola? But without the bank loan

how could I have bought the machine?

If we don't get organized around

here, in this day and age, we'll meet

the same end as the Punch and Judy

shows!

SALVATORE

Could it be your father doesn't like

the work I do...That my family's too

poor...Is that it?

ELENA'S MOTHER

(Off-screen)

Elena!

ELENA

All right! !

(To Salvatore, in a

whisper)

For the moment it's impossible to see

each other...As soon as school is

out, we're going to go stay with

friends in Tuscany. We'll be there

all summer...Maybe if you came up,

we could meet in secret...

SALVATORE

(Crestfallen)

But we're opening the outdoor movie

theatre this summer. What will I do

all this time without seeing you?!

ELENA

I'll write to you every day. Don't

worry. I love you. The summer'll be

over and I'll be back...

ELENA'S MOTHER

(Off-screen)

Elena!

SLAUGHTER-HOUSE MAN

Well, look who's here!! Cecil B. De

Mille! Hey, Toto!! When are you

coming to shoot another film?!?

LITTLE BOYS

All seats are sold out! Free entrance

and payment on the way out!! Sssssh!!

ELENA'S VOICE

(Off-screen)

Salvatore, my darling, here the days

never end. I find your name

everywhere if I read a book, do a

crossword puzzle, thumb through a

newspaper...You're always before my

eyes. Today I've got some rather bad

news. At the end of October we're

moving to the city where I'll attend

the University. It'll be hard to see

each other every day. But don't

worry, whenever I can get away I'll

always come running to you, to the

Cinema Paradiso.

URCHIN

Fuck me! I've caught an octopus! An

oooooctopus!

FADE

SALVATORE

Elena...Elena...Elena...

SALVATORE

When will this shitty summer be over?

(Half shutting his eyes)

In a film it'd already be finished...

(Smiling)

...Fade-out and cut to a nice

thunderstorm!!! Huh? that'd be

perfect!

SALVATORE

Elena!...But when...

ELENA

I got back today. You can't imagine

the excuses I had to make up to be

here...

MAILMAN

Don Ciccio, this is for Toto. Give it

him...

(And he pedals off on his

bicycle.)

ALFREDO

What is it?

SPACCAFICO

Holy blood of Judas! Now what am I

going to do??!

ELENA

So what'd they say?

SALVATORE

The army says that, as a war orphan,

I don't have to serve in the

military, but nothing can be done.

It's a bureaucratic error. I have to

leave. Day after tomorrow morning.

They're sending me to Rome. But

they'll discharge me ten days later.

Let's go...

ELENA

No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's

my father.

SALVATORE

Good, this way we can finally talk.

I'll convince him this time.

ELENA

He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He

has other plans for me.

SALVATORE

Who?

ELENA

The son of one of his colleagues.

Don't act that way. We'll talk about

it later. Wait for me Thursday at the

Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with

the five o'clock bus.

SPACCAFICO

Toto, this is no film for the common

herd. One day'll be more than

enough...So tonight, please set up

tomorrow's film, so the projectionist

who is coming will find it ready.

SALVATORE

OK...

SPACCAFICO

Cheer up, Toto. I'll be here waiting

for you. No one's taking your job

away from you. Don't worry!

ALFREDO

You weren't expecting me?

SALVATORE

(Nervously)

No, Alfredo, I was coming to help

you...

ALFREDO

(Smiling)

You were expecting her? Huh?

(SALVATORE doesn't answer.

He's too worried, too

upset. ALFREDO climbs

another step, whispering.)

...It's a nasty business waiting by

yourself. In company it's better.

No?...Then I'll leave.

SALVATORE

Alfredo, I need your help!

SALVATORE

Open up! Open up! Elenaaa!

ALFREDO

TotooooO! TotooooO!

SPECTATORS

Lights! Christ, what a piece of

crap!! We want OUT money back!!!

Heeeeey!! Bandits!!

ALFREDO

But where'd you go, Toto?!!

SALVATORE

I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!

(And he folds him into his

arms, like calming down a

little boy who has had a

nightmare. Be whispers,

still out of breath:)

Sit down, sit down...

(ALFREDO quiets down as

SALVATORE lowers him into

a chair, and asks him the

only question upon which

his last hope depends.)

Did she come?

ALFREDO

No, nobody came.

(And he embraces him,

almost as if to comfort

him in his great

disappointment.)

SALVATORE

Radio Operator Di Vita Salvatore!

Third Battalion, Ninth Company,

sir!!!

SECOND LIEUTENANT

One, two, one, two!! Attention! Left

march!

SALVATORE

Aaaaaaah! Heeeeeelp!!

SALVATORE

(Aggressively)

Colonel, I was supposed to spend ten

days here and it's been about a year,

and I haven't ever gone borne. I'd

like a furlough, at least!

SALVATORE

Elena...Elena...Elena...

(He has touched the

extreme of suffering, a

young man who has

been denied love and

affection, his rights,

freedom. A NURSE comes

up.)

NURSE

Di Vita Salvatore, get ready, your

discharge has come through.

ALFREDO

You 're thinner...You can tell

you've not been treated well.

(As usual, you can't hide

anything from ALFREDO.

SALVATORE senses something

different in him that he

can't figure out, like

same wild restlessness

within).

SALVATORE

They tell me you never go out, never

talk to anybody. Why?

ALFREDO

Toto, sooner or later there comes a

time when talking or keeping quiet is

the same thing. So it's better to

shut up.

(Changing his lone)

It's hot in here. Toto, take me to

the beach.

SALVATORE

At the Christmas party the lieutenant

pinches a girl's ass. The girl turns

around: it's the daughter of the

commanding officer. The lieutenant is

scared to death and says: 'Miss, if

your heart is as hard as what I have

just touched, I'm done for!

ALFREDO

(Seriously)

Did you ever see her again?

(SALVATORE'S laughter dies

away, taken off-guard as

he is. Then he lights a

cigarette.)

SALVATORE

No. And nobody knows where she is.

ALFREDO

It was probably meant to be like

this. Each of us has a star to

follow. So now what are you thinking

of doing?

SALVATORE

Listen to this one...The commander

says to the sergeant: 'You

remember that windmill that used to

be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the

mill's gone but the wind's still

there!'

(And he bursts into

nervous laughter. But this

time ALFREDO remains cold,

unmoved, does not laugh

with him. SALVATORE

gradually falls silent. He

doesn't know what to say.

For the first time in his

life, he doesn't know what

goal to aim for, doesn't

know what to do. The cloud

of smoke wreaths his

nervous face, now he seems

to relax, whispers:)

You remember the story of the soldier

and the princess?

(ALFREDO nods his head.)

SALVATORE

Now I understand why the soldier went

away just before the end. That's

right, just one more night and the

princess would have been his. But

she, also, could not have kept her

promise. And...that would have been

terrible, he would have died from it.

So instead, for ninety-nine nights at

least he had lived with the illusion

that she was there waiting for him...

(This time SALVATORE is

the one to explain

something to ALFREDO. And

ALFREDO realizes how

bitter his story is and,

above all, that the boy

standing there is no

longer a boy...)

ALFREDO

Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away!

This land is cursed.

(They are now leaning

against a boat on the

beach. ALFREDO goes on

whispering his words.)

When you're here every day you feel

like you're at the center

of the universe, it seems like

nothing ever changes. Then you go

away, one year, two...And when you

come back, everything's different.

The thread has broken. You don't

find those you were looking for, your

things no longer exist. Isn't that

the case?...You've got to go away a

long time, for many, many years,

before coming back and finding your

people again, the land where

you were born...But not now, it's

impossible. Now you're blinder than I

am.

(Intense words, straight

from the heart, and

SALVATORE is spellbound.

He whispers with a smile:)

SALVATORE

Who said that? Gary Cooper, James

Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?

(ALFREDO also gives a

gentle smile)

ALFREDO

No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it!

Life's not like you saw it in the

movies. Life...is harder.

(He lays his hand on

SALVATORE'S shoulder,

gives it a hard squeeze.)

Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're

young, the world is yours! And I'm

old...I don't want to hear you talk

any more, I want to hear talk about

you.

ALFREDO

Don't come back any more, don't think

about us, don't turn round, don't

write, don't give in to nostalgia.

Forget us all. If you can't hear it

and come back, don't come looking for

me, I won't let you into the house,

you understand?

SALVATORE

Thanks for all you've done for me.

ALFREDO

Whatever you do, love it like you

loved that projection booth of the

Paradiso when you were little...

(The train moves now.

Hands wave in the air,

drawing further and

further away. The PRIEST

has arrived at the last

moment and waves goodbye

from the distance.)

PRIEST

(Shouting)

Goodbye, TotooooooO!!! I got here too

late. What a shame!

MARIA

It's Toto...I knew it...

MARIA 'S VOICE

(Off-screen)

Toto!...

SALVATORE'S VOICE (Off-screen)

How are you, Mamma?...

MARIA

Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll

see. And you won't recognize the

kids any more, they're grown up by

now.

SALVATORE

(Smiling)

They're always writing to me saying

they want to come to Rome!

MARIA

See how pretty the house is? We did

everything over.

(Smiling)

If it hadn't been for you!

(Getting up)

Come, I have a surprise....

(She takes him by the hand

and leads him out to the

hallway. SALVATORE looks

at her and feels a pang.

She seems smaller, age

withers the body, she is

slightly stooped, her hair

is gathered into a knot at

the back other head.)

You must be tired. If you want to

rest, there's time before the

funeral.

SALVATORE

(Interrupting her)

No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by

air, you know.

MARIA

(Smiling, ironically)

You shouldn't tell me that now. After

all these years!

(SALVATORE gets the

message, feels guilty.

Thinking about it, it

seems incredible that he

has never come before.

MARIA opens a door, steps

aside to let her son in,

whispers:)

I put all your things in here. Go in,

go in...

ANNA

He would have been happy you came,

Toto. He always talked about you.

Always! Right to the end! He was

terribly fond of you...

(Tears come to her, she is

unable to say any more.

SALVATORE gives her a hug,

deeply touched by her

words.)

He left two things for you. Come see

me before you leave.

SALVATORE

(Under his breath)

How long's it been shut?

SPACCAFICO

Six years ago this May. No one came

any more. You "know better than me,

Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television,

videos. By now the movie business is

only a dream. The city's bought it

now to make a new parking lot. Next

Saturday they're

tearing it down...A pity!...

SALVATORE

But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'?

It didn't used to be that way...

SPACCAFICO

Well, it's hard to call an important

person by his first name. But if it

really matters to you, I'11 call

you...

(Smiling)

Toto!...

SPACCAFICO

Bless you, Toto.

SARA

(Playfully)

Uncle, the next time Granny comes to

Rome, I want to come along too. I

want to see what you do when you

work...

SALVATORE

(Smiling)

Fine. But I warn you, there isn't

much to see. I sell much more smoke

than fire...

ALFIO

(To SALVATORE)

Watch out, don't get too familiar

with those two

(indicating the children)

they're worse than cannibals. They'll

take advantage.

FILIPPO

You leaving tomorrow, Uncle?

SALVATORE

I don't know, Filippo. I don't

know...

MARIA

(To SALVATORE)

It must be for you...They've been

calling all afternoon. They wanted to

know if you're leaving this evening

or tomorrow...

SALVATORE

A double whisky, please.

SALVATORE

Excuse me, Miss...

(She turns to look at him,

indifferent, but friendly.

He looks at her wonderful

blue eyes.)

I'm so sorry, I thought you were

someone else.

GIRL

(Shrugging)

Well.

MARIA

What are you thinking, Toto?

SALVATORE

I was thinking...that we've never

talked, Mamma...When I was little I

saw you as if you were already old.

That's probably true with all kids...

Who knows?

(She nods, then sits down

before him. He strokes her

old, skinny, heavily

veined hands...)

But only now do I realize you were

young, you were beautiful, had a

whole life before you. But how...

(Sighing)

...how could you have lived alone

all that time, with no one to look

after you? You could have

remarried...Why not? At the time I

probably wouldn't have understood,

but I would have later...

MARIA

I never had anybody. If that's what

you think...I didn't want anybody. I

always remained faithful. First to

your father, then to you, to Lia.

(With a shrug)

That's the way I'm made, there's

nothing I can do about it.

(Smiling)

And you're like me, you're too honest

and too attached to the things you

love...But I don't know if that's a

good thing. Faithfulness is a bad

business. If you're faithful, you're

always alone!

(SALVATORE is immersed in

the profound truth of

those words. And he says

nothing. The silence is

broken by the ringing of

the phone. A menacing

sound, which SALVATORE

cannot bear. He knows they

are calling him from Rome,

gives a nervous gesture,

stands up and pulls out

the plug. The silence

returns, the whistling of

the wind. MARIA lowers her

eyes.)

It's my fault! It would have been

better if I hadn't called you...

SALVATORE

(Whispering)

No...It's nothing to do with you.

It's just that I was scared of coming

back. Now, after all these years, I

thought I was strong, that I had

forgotten lots of things. Instead, I

find it's quite the opposite, as if I

had never left. And yet, I look at

Lia and feel as if I didn't know her,

and you, Mamma...I abandoned you,

ran away like a thief, thought only

of myself, and never gave you

an explanation...

MARIA

(Interrupting him)

And I never asked for one! You have

nothing to explain. I always thought

that what you did was right, and that

was that. With no beating around the

bush...

(Smiling, playing it down)

Only one thing made me suffer:

bolting the door shut before going to

bed at night...

SALVATORE

You never used to do that!

MARIA

No, no...When you used to work at

the movies, I could never get to

sleep at night until you came home.

Then when you arrived, I pretended to

be asleep, but I heard all your

movements. Then when you fell asleep,

I'd get up and bolt the door. Then,

when you left, every time I did it, I

felt as if I had left somebody

outside the door, far away....

(SALVATORE listens to his

MOTHER'S words, surprised

and entranced by the

poetry of her way of

speaking...)

But you were right to leave. You

succeeded in doing what you wanted to

do...

(Sighing)

When I call you, a different, woman

always answers. I pretend I know them

so they won't have to go through the

embarrassment of introducing

themselves.

(Smiling)

I'm sure they take me for a crazy old

woman. But so far I've never heard

one voice that really loves you...I

would have known. And yet, I'd like

to see you...settled down...fall in

love...

(Gazing into his eyes)

But your life's there. Here there are

nothing but ghosts, Toto! Let it go.

SALVATORE

(To himself)

Boccia!

SALVATORE

(Mumbling)

His last name was Lo Meo, Vincenzo.

VOICE ON TELEPHONE

Hello?

(It's a woman's voice.

SALVATORE shuts his eyes,

is about to speak, but the

lump in his throat

silences him...)

VOICE ON TELEPHONE

Hello? Hello?

BARMAN

You want something?

VOICE ON TELEPHONE

Hello, who's speaking?

SALVATORE

I'd like to speak to Signora Elena...

VOICE ON TELEPHONE

Speaking. Who is it, please?

SALVATORE

Salvatore.

VOICE ON TELEPHONE

Salvatore...who?

SALVATORE

Di Vita. Salvatore Di Vita. Do you

remember?

(Another pause chilly,

heavy. SALVATORE opens his

eyes, looks at the window.

Her shadow is motionless,

as if cut out of

cardboard.)

Elena, I'm here, in the bar, across

the street from your house.

VOICE ON TELEPHONE

Certainly, I remember...

SALVATORE

Elena. I'd like to see you...Let's

meet.

VOICE ON TELEPHONE

It's been so long. Why should we

meet? What good would it do?

SALVATORE

Please, don't say no.. .

VOICE ON TELEPHONE

I'm old, Salvatore. And you too. It's

best not to meet. Goodbye.

MARIA

Hello?

ELENA

Salvatore!

SALVATORE

How'd you know I'd be here?

SALVATORE

You're still beautiful...

ELENA

Don't be silly...I'm old.

(She looks down troubled

by the way he has of

gazing into her eyes,

speaks almost mumbling her

words.)

Don't look at me like that, please.

(And she switches off the

light. But this time it is

less dark, things can be

seen.)

Why'd you come back?

SALVATORE

Alfredo died. Do you remember him?

ELENA

Of course I remember him. I'm sorry.

You were terribly fond of him.

SALVATORE

I saw your daughter. She's beautiful!

Who knows how many Salvatores

must be running after her...

ELENA

(Smiling)

One or two. Bur there're not all that

many Salvatores.

(SALVATORE also smiles,

but a puzzled smile as if

what she has said had

thrown him off-guard.)

I've got a son, too...he's older.

And you, do you have children?

SALVATORE

No. And I'm not married.

(ELENA sits there in

silence. A veil of sadness

clouds her eyes.

SALVATORE'S

too...)

Are you happy?

ELENA

All things considered, yes. Even if

it wasn't what I dreamt of then...

ELENA

My husband...you know him.

SALVATORE

Sure, sure! Boccia...

(With a bitter smile)

What's he do?

ELENA

Politics. He's the district

representative. We met at the

University in Pisa.

SALVATORE

And...how come you never married

that guy from Tuscany?

ELENA

I didn't want to...I had to fight

tooth and nail. But in the end I

won...

(SALVATORE is unable to

smile. It's as if the void

were growing and swelling

within. Thunder and

lightning shatter the

roaring of the wind and

sea, hut it does not rain.

Now her smile Jades away.)

At that time...I was waiting for

you...

SALVATORE

But I've never forgotten you, Elena!

ELENA

(Whispering)

Nor have I. Even though you

disappeared...

(SALVATORE is staggered,

feels as if he were

plunging into the void.

What she has said strikes

him as grotesque. ELENA

strokes his hair, as if to

restrain his sinking

heart, gives a sweet

smile.)

But what's the point of talking about

it? We risk being pathetic and

ridiculous.

(And she tries to change

the subject.)

You still live in Rome?

SALVATORE

What do you mean, you were waiting

for me?! What are you saying?

(He controls himself at

once, continues, breathing

heavily.)

The last time we saw each other, we

made a date to meet at the Cinema

Paradiso. You remember? And you

didn't come, you disappeared without

leaving a trace, nothing! I'll tell

you how many years have gone by: more

than thirty!!!

ELENA

I kept that date.

(SALVATORE laughs at the

absurdity of it. A

nervous, heartbroken

laugh, which slowly melts

away as she goes on to

say:)

But I was late...

(Tears continue to stream

out of her blue eyes, but

she tells her story in a

calm voice.)

I had a fight with my family. I tried

to convince them again that they

couldn't separate us. But it was

futile. They had decided to leave

Sicily once and for all. Which is

what we did. I didn't know what to do

any more, what to say. And I said

yes, I'd do whatever they wanted. In

return, my father promised to let me

see you one last time, to say

goodbye. But I hoped that by seeing

each other we could take advantage of

it and make a decision...I thought

we would run away together.

(She holds back her sobs.

Dries her tears with the

back of her hand, and

continues:)

My father drove me to the movie

theatre. But you weren't in the

projection booth. Only Alfredo...

ELENA'S VOICE

(Off-screen)

And I didn't have time to wait for

you to comeback...

ELENA' S FATHER

Elena! Hurry up!!

YOUNG ELENA

All right, Daddy!...

ELENA'S VOICE

(Off-screen)

So I told Alfredo how things stood

and fiat I was leaving the same

evening, and I asked him to tell you

everything. He was very kind, he

listened carefully, then...

ALFREDO

Easy, easy.

(Sighing)

Listen carefully to what I have to

say. If you want me to tell Toto what

you've told me, I will. But if you

want my advice, forget it. It's

better for both of you if you don't

see each other...

(YOUNG ELENA gives a start

of resentment, listens

with surprise.)

Dear girl, fire always turns into

ashes! Even the deepest love ends

sooner or later. And after that other

loves appear, lots of them. Toto, he

can't understand fiat now. If I tell

him he won't believe it, he' d be

capable of killing me...But you can

understand, you've got to

understand...Do it for him!

ELENA

It's the first time I've had to

chance to tell the story. I never

mentioned it to anybody.

SALVATORE

(In a daze)

Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell

on you too!

ELENA

I told him I'd take his advice. But

before I went away I left you that

note...

(SALVATORE gives her a

quick look, a questioning

look. He listens.)

I was on my way down the stairs...

(Her voice continues, laid

over the...)

ELENA' S VOICE

(Off-screen)

I thought Alfredo couldn't see me. So

I snuck back up...

(She tip-toes back without

making any noise. Goes

over to the film-winder.

Takes out a pen, looks for

a scrap of paper, but

doesn't see any. Her eyes

fall on the film receipts

hanging on the nail. She

tears off the top one,

turns it over and

scribbles a message on the

back.)

I wrote you where you could find me,

and that I'd wait for you.

ELENA

But you disappeared all the same.

SALVATORE

Oh, how I looked for you, Elena!

You'll never know. I wrote,

telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever

answered. But I dreamt of you for

years! That's why I went away...and

never came back here.

(And his anguish breaks

free, dissolving into

quiet, almost childish

tears. ELENA is startled

by his reaction. She

caresses him,

passionately. They embrace

and remain like that, she

with her face buried in

his shoulder, he leaning

on hers with his tear-

filled eyes.)

Even as the years passed, in all the

women I met, I was only looking for

you. I had success it's true, but

there was always something missing...

(She is deeply moved, goes

on caressing him gently

until he calms down. The

car windows are steamed

up. The sea, the harbor,

the waves have

disappeared. Nothing

remains but the sound of

the storm. SALVATORE takes

her face between his

hands. They gaze at each

other, their faces

practically touching. He

murmurs:)

I'd never have imagined that all this

had to end because of the man who was

like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!

(She gives a faint smile.)

ELENA

He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I

was upset. I think I really hated

him. But then, with time, I

understood what he said...and your

silence too.

SALVATORE

But I never saw that note!

(He squints, as if to

stress the absurdity of

the idea.)

I must have covered it with my hand,

without realizing it, that's the only

explanation...

(But strangely enough,

ELENA is not surprised.)

ELENA

What difference does it make to find

an explanation? That's the way it

went. But Alfredo didn't betray you,

he was the only one who really

understood you. Salvatore, if you had

chosen to be with me, you'd have

never made your films. And that would

have been a pity! Because they're

wonderful, I've seen them all.

(Her eyes glitter with

joy, then she smiles,

almost ironically.)

But you shouldn't have gone and

changed your name. You should have

kept your own.

ANNA

These are the things he left to

you...

ANNA

When they showed your films on

television, he was happy. He'd plop

himself down there and all his

ailments were forgotten. He knew all

the words by heart, every one, and

I'd describe what was going on. And

when the papers talked about

you, I had to read them two or three

times...

SALVATORE

Did he ever think of meeting me?

ANNA

No, never! One time your mother said

that if he wanted, you'd have surely

come. He got furious and said  'No,

Toto mustn't come back to Giancaldo,

never!!' He didn't say it to be mean.

He was a decent man. Who knows what

he could have been thinking? Towards

the end he'd say such strange things.

And a moment before he shut his eyes,

he told your mother not to let you

know.

SALVATORE'S VOICE

(Off-screen)

Salvatore, forgive me. I'll explain

later what happened. Not finding you

here was terrible. Unfortunately,

this evening, my mother and I are

leaving for Tuscany. We're moving

there. But you' re the only one I

love, I'll never be with anybody

else, I promise. Here's the address

of a girlfriend of mine where you

can write to me. Don't abandon me.

Love and kisses, Elena.

ELENA

When are you leaving?

SALVATORE

This afternoon. Elena, in the future

maybe we could...

ELENA

No, Salvatore...there is no future.

There's only the past. Even meeting

last night was nothing but a dream, a

beautiful dream.

(Smiling)

We never did it when we were kids,

remember?

(Down in the cafe,

SALVATORE nods his head

slowly, desperately.)

Now that it's happened, I don't think

there could have been a better

ending.

(It's farewell. SALVATORE

glances one last time at

that window.)

SALVATORE

I'll never agree with you. Never,

Elena.

VILLAGE IDIOT

The square's mine, the square's mine,

the square's mine...

SALVATORE

Please check the splices. As soon as

you're ready you can start.

PROJECTIONIST

OK. Congratulations on your film.

It's terrific.

SALVATORE

Thanks.

SALVATORE

Well?

COLLEAGUE

The distributor is opening up the

film earlier. The press conference is

in the afternoon. The actors will

also be there, the producer, just

about everyone.

ASSISTANT

The official notification of the

award just came out, but we've

already received a mountain of

telegrams. Aren't you happy?

SALVATORE

It's all right. We'll talk about it

later.
