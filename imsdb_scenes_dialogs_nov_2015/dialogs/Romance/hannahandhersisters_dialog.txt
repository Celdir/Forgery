HANNAH AND HER SISTERS

by

Woody Allen

"God, she's beautiful..."

CUT TO:

ELLIOT (V.O.)

God, she's beautiful.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

She's got the prettiest eyes, and

she looks so sexy in that sweater.

LEE

Hi, how are you?

ELLIOT (V.O.)

I just want to be alone with her

and hold her and kiss her...

ELLIOT (V.O.)

...and tell her how much I love her

and take care of her.  Stop it, you

idiot.  She's your wife's sister.

But I can't help it.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

I'm consumed by her.  It's been

months now.  I dream about her.  I-

I, I think about her at the office.

Oh, Lee.

(sighing)

What am I gonna do?

ELLIOT (V.O.)

I hear myself mooning over you, and

it's disgusting.  Before, when she...

ELLIOT (V.O.)

...squeezed past me in the doorway,

and I smelled that perfume on the

back of her neck...

ELLIOT (V.O.)

...Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna

swoon!  Easy...

ELLIOT (V.O.)

You're a dignified financial

advisor.  It doesn't look good for

you to swoon.

HANNAH

(nibbling on an hors d'oeuvre)

Elliot?  Elliot?

(rubbing his shoulder)

Sweetheart?

ELLIOT

(turning to Hannah)

Mm-hm?

HANNAH

(pointing to the tray)

Have you tried these?  These are

wonderful.

(nibbling, swallowing)

Holly and her friend made them.

ELLIOT

(swallowing)

They're fantastic.

HANNAH

(overlapping, still eating)

Aren't they great?

ELLIOT

Your sister is an unbelievable cook.

HANNAH

(swallowing)

I know!  I know!

HANNAH

(walking offscreen)

She has all the cooking talent.

ELLIOT

(walking offscreen swallowing)

No, she doesn't, either.  You've

got tons as well.

HANNAH

(offscreen)

Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.

ELLIOT

(offscreen,

overlapping Holly)

Holly, why don't you open your own

restaurant?

HOLLY

(turning to the

offscreen Elliot and

Hannah, trying to swallow)

Mmm, we practically are.  Well...

(holding her hand to

her mouth)

not a restaurant, but...

(swallowing)

April and I are going to do some

catering!

HANNAH

(offscreen)

What?  You're kidding!

HOLLY

(nodding)

No, no, we decided!

HANNAH

Perfect!

HOLLY

(nodding and swallowing)

Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for

our friends, so

(gesturing)

we thought until an acting job

comes through, we could just make

some extra money, you know, doing a

few private parties.

ELLIOT

(nodding)

Great idea.

HANNAH

(agreeing)

I know.

ELLIOT

(overlapping Hannah)

That's where your talent lies.

HOLLY

(swallowing and nodding)

I know.

HOLLY

(gesturing to Elliot,

still laughing)

Get outta here.

(to Hannah)

Could I speak to you privately?

HANNAH

Oh, sure.

ELLIOT

(calling after them

as he nibbles on an

hors d'oeuvre)

I'm her husband!  She tells me

anything!

CUT TO:

HOLLY

Hannah, I have to borrow some more

money.

(sipping her drink)

Don't get upset.

HANNAH

(stirring some food

in a saucepan on the stove)

Mmm, I never get upset over that.

Mmm?

HOLLY

This is the last time, I promise.

And I'm keeping strict accounts.

HANNAH

Holly, please.  Don't insult me.

HOLLY

(putting her empty

glass and plate down

on the table)

Someday, I'll pay it all back.

HANNAH

I know.  H-how much do you need?

HOLLY

Two thousand dollars.

HANNAH

(trying to nod her

head casually)

Uh-huh.

HOLLY

(gesturing, her back

to the camera)

Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my

friend April and I, we have this

catering idea I think's going to be

great.

HOLLY

(turning to face Hannah)

You admit that we're great cooks,

right?

HANNAH

(nodding, back at the

stove now, stirring

in a pot)

Yeah.

HOLLY

(putting her hands in

her pockets)

Well, in order to get started,

there's just a few things I have to

buy...

(gesturing)

and some old debts I have

outstanding.

HANNAH

(looking at her sister)

Will you just tell me one thing?

HOLLY

(nodding)

Okay.

HANNAH

Are we talking about cocaine again?

HOLLY

(shaking her head no)

I swear.  I swear.  We've already

got some requests to do a few

dinner parties.

HOLLY

I mean, obviously, I'm not going to

be a caterer forever, you know.  We

both still go to auditions.

Something could turn up at any

moment.  But the parties are at

night, days are free, I can still

take my acting class.  I haven't

done drugs on a year.

EVAN & NORMA

(singing)

"A whimpering, simpering

Child again

Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered

Am I..."

LEE

Mom and Dad are floating down

memory lane again!

HANNAH

(smiling and turning

to Lee)

Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly

and her friend's shrimp puffs?

LEE

(nodding to Holly,

touching her arm)

I think they're fantastic.

HANNAH

(to Holly)

You've outdone yourself.

HOLLY

(overlapping her

sisters, shrugging

and smiling)

Oh, my God.  Thank you.

LEE

(interrupting, to Hannah)

I need an antihistamine.  Mom

thinks she's feeling her asthma,

and so...

HANNAH

(overlapping)

Ohh?

HOLLY

(overlapping, lighting

a cigarette)

Uh-oh.

LEE

(continuing)

...before she starts turning into

Camille...

(laughing)

HOLLY

(overlapping)

Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets

up in the morning.

LEE

(turning to Holly)

At least she isn't drinking.  Did

you notice?

HOLLY

(nodding)

Mm-hm.

HANNAH

(turning to look at

her sisters, laughing)

Doesn't she look great in that new

dress?

HOLLY

(nodding)

Yeah.

LEE

(nodding)

Yeah.

HANNAH

Don't you think she does?

HOLLY

She really does, though.

LEE

(turning towards the sink)

Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause

she's flirting with all the men here.

HOLLY

(puffing on her cigarette)

God.

HANNAH

(scooping out some

cantaloupe seeds)

Maybe when she's eighty, she'll

stop straightening her garter belt

when there's a guy around.

HOLLY

(to Lee, laughing)

I should get a garter belt.

LEE

(laughing)

Yeah.

HOLLY

(looking down at herself)

Get a garter belt...

(sipping her drink)

Get a garter belt and flirt.

LEE

(laughing, to Hannah)

Where are the antihistamines?

HANNAH

Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that.

Uh, he's got them somewhere.

LEE

(nodding)

Okay.

HOLLY

(sighing)

Frederick didn't come with her.

HANNAH

(turning to Holly,

still working at the sink)

When does Frederick ever come with

her?

HOLLY

(whispering intently)

Tch.  He's such an angry...he's

such a depressive.  I thought she

was moving out!

EVAN & NORMA

(singing)

"A pill he is

But still he is

All mine and I'll

Keep him until he is

Bewitched, a'both--"

CUT TO:

HANNAH

(to the children)

Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!

HOLLY

(overlapping)

Oh, your kids are so adorable.

CHILDREN

(walking through the doorway)

Bye!  Bye!

HOLLY

(putting down her

bowl on the table)

God, it gets so lonely on the

holidays.

HANNAH

(setting down the

turkey on the opposite

end of the table)

Oh, gosh.  Well, you know, that's

why I invited Phil Gammage tonight.

HOLLY

(grimacing, reacting

to Hannah)

Oh, Hannah!

HANNAH

(overlapping)

It's, uh, you never know--

HOLLY

(interrupting, gesturing)

He's such a loser!

HANNAH

He's not a loser at all!

HOLLY

(shaking her head)

Oh, he's such a loser!

HANNAH

(overlapping, lighting

a set of candles on

the table)

He's the headmaster of Daisy's

school.

HOLLY

Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of

Ichabod Crane.

(moving her hand up

and down her throat)

His Adam's apple keeps jumping up

and down whenever he gets excited.

HANNAH

(laughing)

Listen.  He's a lot better than

your ex-husband.  He's got a good

job.

(handing a pack of

matches to Holly)

Would you light those, please?

He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or

anything.

HOLLY

(striking a match to

light another set of candles)

Give me a break.

APRIL

(offscreen)

Am I interrupting...

APRIL

(continuing)

...any sister talk?

HANNAH

(offscreen)

Mm-mm!

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Come in.

APRIL

Oh, good...

HANNAH

(overlapping, still offscreen)

Come in, come in.

APRIL

(gesturing)

...because there are no interesting

single men at this party!

HANNAH

(now onscreen)

Oh, listen...

HOLLY

(interrupting, waving

out her match)

I know.  It's terrible!

APRIL

(shaking her head)

I mean, I've looked everywhere.

HANNAH

(picking at the

turkey and gesturing)

Maybe April would like Phil.  Phil

Gammage, the tall guy in there by

the piano.

APRIL

(pointing to herself)

Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.

HANNAH

(looking at April, nodding)

Mmm?

APRIL

He's the--He looks like Ichabod

Crane?

APRIL

(laughing with the

sisters, gesturing)

I love that.  That's my type.

HANNAH

(shaking her head, laughing)

I can't believe it!

APRIL

(nodding and looking

at Hannah)

No, really, I really like him a lot.

HOLLY

(overlapping, laughing

and gesturing)

No, really, we mustn't get

discouraged.

HOLLY

(fussing at the table)

Hannah will invite some men over

who don't look like Ichabod Crane.

APRIL

(overlapping)

Mmm.

HOLLY

(straightening a

table setting)

Not this Thanksgiving, you know.

HANNAH

(overlapping, to

April, who has just

set down her apples)

Here.  Be careful with those.

HOLLY

(continuing her

teasing, gesturing)

Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If

not this New Year's, maybe next New

Year's.

HOLLY

(reacting)

Ouch!

HANNAH

(turning to her

sister in surprise)

Oh!

ELLIOT

(searching)

Must be here someplace.

LEE

(offscreen)

Oh, you know, I, I love that book

you lent me.  The Easter Parade?

You were right.  It had very

special meaning for me.

ELLIOT

How's Frederick?  He didn't come.

LEE

(offscreen)

Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One

of his moods.  Although it wasn't a

bad week.  He

(onscreen)

uh, sold a picture.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

Oh, great.

LEE

Yeah, it was, it was one of his

better drawings, a very beautiful

nude study.  Actually, it was of me.

(laughing)

It's funny, you know, it's a funny

feeling to know you're being hung

naked in some stranger's living room.

LEE

Well, you can't tell it's me,

although--

(pausing)

You're turning all red, Elliot.

ELLIOT

(laughing self-consciously)

Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh-

what are you up to?

LEE

(offscreen)

Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment

checks are running out.  Um, I was

thinking of taking some courses at

Columbia with the last of my savings.

ELLIOT

Like, uh...?

LEE

(offscreen)

I don't know exactly.

LEE

Uh, sociology, psychology maybe.  I

always thought I might like to work

with children.

ELLIOT

(gesturing with the

bottle of pills

gripped in his hand)

Incidentally, I-I always have

clients who are furnishing places.

Some of them might-might be

interested in buying art.  Shall I,

shall I call you?

(chuckling self-consciously)

LEE

Yeah, sure.

(taking the bottle of

pills Elliot hands her)

You know, uh, Frederick would

really by grateful for a sale.

HANNAH

(offscreen)

Hey, you guys?

HANNAH

(offscreen)

Dinner's ready.

LEE

(offscreen)

Oh, great.

HANNAH

(overlapping)

You look so beautiful.

LEE

(offscreen)

Come on.

HANNAH

(standing by Elliot

and Lee)

Doesn't she look pretty?

LEE

I bumped into your...

ELLIOT

(overlapping, agreeing

with Hannah)

Yeah.

LEE

(continuing)

...ex-husband on the street the

other day.

HANNAH

(biting her carrot)

Oh, yeah?

LEE

(gesturing)

He was, he's just as crazy as ever.

He was on his way to get a blood

test.

(laughing, Elliot

joining in)

HANNAH

(reacting)

God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac.

I wonder how he'd handle it if

there was ever anything really

wrong with him?

ELLIOT

(standing up)

Let's go have dinner, shall we?

HANNAH

(overlapping)

Mmm.

LEE

(standing up, overlapping)

Good idea.

CUT TO:

EVAN

(clanking a piece of

silverware against

his water glass)

Now, ladies and gentlemen...

HOLLY

(making a face)

Dad.

HOLLY

Dad...

LEE

(reacting, to Holly)

Oh...

HOLLY

Dad!

EVAN

(still clanking)

No, now...

HOLLY

I'm starving!

EVAN

(clanking away)

...this is a toast!  This is a toast.

HANNAH

(reaching across the

table for Evan's wine

glass, laughing)

Get his wine away.

EVAN

This is a toast.  You know this

beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was

all...

EVAN

...prepared...by Hannah.

HANNAH

(modestly pointing to

the maid)

Uh, and a little help...

NORMA

(to her daughters)

Hey!

HANNAH

(continuing)

...from Mavis, also.

ELLIOT

(hugging Hannah)

You bet.

HANNAH

(overlapping, looking

down the table while

still in Elliot's embrace)

Holly and April, thanks for helping.

EVAN

(overlapping the noise)

No, you did it.

HOLLY

(overlapping, toasting

her friend)

April, April!

HANNAH

(overlapping, gesturing)

I am... I did slave all day.

EVAN

(overlapping, holding

out his wine glass)

And we drink to her, and we all

congratulate her on her wonderful

accomplishment during this last

year...her great success in A

Doll's House!

NORMA

(overlapping, laughing)

Ya-a-a-a-y!

(laughing)

I played Nora.  I hate to tell you

what year...

NORMA

(continuing)

And it's very difficult to behave

like Torvald's little chipmunk

without making a perfect ass out of

yourself!

(pausing while the

guests laugh heartily)

Now I think that Ibsen would have

been damn proud of our Hannah!

APRIL

(overlapping the

applause and clapping loudly)

Speech!  Speech!  Speech!

NORMA

(overlapping)

Yea-a-a-a-ah!

HANNAH

(reacting)

I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I

just, see, I-I've been very, very

lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I

decided to stop working and just,

you know, devote myself to having

the family, and I've been very,

very happy

(banging her fists

lightly on the table)

but...I've always secretly hoped

that maybe some little gem would

come along and tempt me back on the

stage...

EVAN

(nodding)

Yeah.

HANNAH

(overlapping)

...just for a second.  So, now I

got that out of my system and I can

go back to the thing that makes me

happiest.

EVAN

(chuckling)

Oh, bravo!  Bravo!

CUT TO:

"We all had a terrific time."

LEE (V.O.)

Is it my imagination, or does

Elliot have a little crush on me?

(chuckling slightly)

It's funny.  I've had that thought

before.  He pays a lot of attention

to me all the time, and he blushed

tonight when we were alone in the

bedroom.  I wonder if he and Hannah

are happy?  It's funny, I...I still

feel a little buzz from his flirting.

CUT TO:

LEE

(to an offscreen Frederick)

Want some coffee or tea?

FREDERICK

(offscreen)

No, thank you.

LEE

(stirring her coffee)

How about something to eat?

FREDERICK

No, nothing.

LEE

Are you sure?

FREDERICK

Absolutely.

LEE

(walking around the

screen to Frederick)

Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?

(laughing)

LEE

God!

(sniffing)

And why didn't you come tonight?

We all had a terrific time.  I

really think you would have enjoyed

yourself.

FREDERICK

(not looking at Lee)

I'm going through a period of my

life where I just can't be around

people.

(putting down the

brushes and wiping

his hands with the

same rag)

I didn't want to wind up abusing

anyone.

LEE

You're not going to abuse them.

They're all so sweet.

FREDERICK

(taking off his glasses)

Lee...

(pausing, reaching

for Lee's hand)

you are the only person I can be

with...who I really look forward to

being with.

(pulling Lee to him,

around the board)

LEE

(compliantly)

You're too harsh with everyone.

You know that, don't you?

FREDERICK

(looking into Lee's eyes)

Isn't it enough that I can love you?

LEE

(sighing)

Mmm...

FREDERICK

Hmm?

LEE

(overlapping)

...you're such a puzzle.

(chuckling)

So sweet with me and

so...contemptuous of everyone else.

(sighing)

FREDERICK

(sniffing)

Well, there was a time

(sniffing again)

when you were very happy to be only

with me.  You wanted to learn

everything about poetry, about music.

LEE

(nodding)

Mm-hm.

FREDERICK

Have I really taught you everything

I have to give?

(shakes his head)

I don't think so.

LEE

(turning her head in

Frederick's direction)

Oh, Elliot said he might have a

couple of clients for you.

FREDERICK

(offscreen)

I'm sure all those morons he

handles have a deep feeling for art.

LEE

(flipping through the book)

Mmm

(chuckling)

you never know.  They might.  He's

just trying to do the nice thing.

FREDERICK

(offscreen)

Because he likes you.

LEE

(looking up from the book)

Me?

FREDERICK

Yeah.

FREDERICK

(looking at Lee as he

goes by)

Elliot lusts after you.

LEE

Based on what?  You never even see

him.

FREDERICK

Based on...whenever you see him,

you always come home full of books

he's recommended...

FREDERICK

(continuing)

...or films you must see or...

(shrugging)

LEE

(walking over to him)

Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's

husband.  And I think if you gave

him half a chance, you'd like him.

He's very intelligent.

FREDERICK

He's a glorified accountant, and

he's after you.

(kissing Lee's hand)

And I prefer to sell my work to

people who appreciate it, not to

rock stars.

(kissing Lee's face)

You understand?

LEE

(sighing)

Ohhh!

CUT TO:

The hypochondriac.

MICKEY

(gesturing)

What do you mean, they won't let us

do the sketch?

PAUL

Talk to Standards and Practices.

They think it's too dirty.

MICKEY

But we showed it to them in

rehearsal!

MICKEY

(to Paul)

You know, what'd they do, figure

out what the words mean?

MARY

Mickey, we got a half hour to air!

LARRY

We're short!  The show is five

minutes short!

MICKEY

How could it be short?  We timed

everything

(offscreen)

long.

PAUL

(offscreen)

If we have to...

PAUL

(continuing)

...pull out the sketch, then we'll

be ten minutes short!

MICKEY

(gesturing)

I don't know how they can do that

to us.  That's-- We go on in thirty

minutes, right?

LARRY

(squeezing past

several passersby)

They're doing it because our

ratings are low.

MICKEY

(nervously rubbing

his forehead)

I got such a migraine.

GAIL

(offscreen)

Hey, Mickey!

GAIL

Mickey!  Listen, we better go right

to Ronny's dressing room.  This kid

must have taken sixteen hundred

Quaaludes.  I don't think he's

going to be able to do the show!

MICKEY

(gesturing towards heaven)

Why me, Lord?  What did I--

MICKEY

You--

(pointing)

Standards and Practices?

ED

Ed Smythe, yes.

MICKEY

Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the

sketch dirty?

(putting his hands on

his hips)

ED

(gesturing)

Child molestation is a touchy

subject...

MICKEY

(overlapping, looking

at Gail)

Could you--

ED

(continuing)

...with the affiliates.

MICKEY

(overlapping and grunting)

Read the papers!  Half the country's

doing it!

ED

(pointing at Mickey)

Yes, but you name names.

MICKEY

(gesturing)

We nev-- We don't name names!

(turning to Gail for

support, briefly

touching her

shoulders, then

looking back at Ed)

We say the Pope.

GAIL

(gesturing emphatically)

We always say the Pope!

ED

That sketch...

MICKEY

(overlapping)

We--

ED

(continuing)

...cannot go on the air.

MICKEY

Oh, Je--

WRITER

(interrupting, shouting)

Hey!

WRITER

(angrily, slapping

his script)

Who changed my sketch about the PLO?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

I had to make some cuts.  It's four

lousy lines!

WRITER

The whole premise is ruined!

MICKEY

(gesturing, trying to

calm the writer down)

Oh, you're crazy!  It's not so

delicate.  Everybody's married to

every line.

GAIL

(tapping Mickey's shoulder)

Mickey, I can--

WRITER

(interrupting,

angrily gesturing)

I don't care!  I don't want anyone

tampering with my goddamn work

without telling me!

MICKEY

(shrugging)

Okay.

WRITER

(pointing angrily)

You want 'em cut?!  I'll cut 'em

myself!

MICKEY

(shrugging, distracted)

All right, all right.

(muttering)

GAIL

(overlapping, trying

to get Mickey's

attention and gesturing)

Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.

MICKEY

(distractedly, his

mind still on the writer)

You know...

(muttering as the

writer passes him and

walks away)

GAIL

(overlapping, gesturing)

In-in-in-instead of the child

molestation sketch, why don't we

repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald

Reagan homosexual dance number?

MICKEY

(still distracted,

looking off)

No--

RON

(overlapping)

I don't feel good, Mickey.

MICKEY

(gesturing)

Yeah, wh-- Yeah, what did you do?

Swallow a drugstore?!

MICKEY

(to Gail)

Look at this guy.

GAIL

(overlapping, touching

Ron's chair)

Yeah?

RON

(groaning)

I lost my voice.

MICKEY

(reacting)

Oh, Jesus!

GAIL

(gesturing)

Ron...Ronny, you know you do have

to go on in twenty-five minutes.

MICKEY

(looking around,

touching his stomach)

Hey, does anybody got a Tagamet?

My, my ulcer's starting to kill me!

RON

(sighing)

You want a Quaalude?

MICKEY (V.O.)

Christ, this show is ruining my

health!  Meanwhile, my ex-partner

moves to California and every

stupid show he produces turns out

to be a big hit.  Brother, what am

I gonna do with my life?  Speaking

of that, I-I...gotta remember to

see my ex-wife tomorrow.  Tch.

CUT TO:

HANNAH

Hi!  Hi!

MICKEY

(overlapping, sniffing)

I know...I know.

HANNAH

Glad you could put in an appearance.

MICKEY

(gesturing)

I got two minutes.

HANNAH

(overlapping)

Very good.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

I got two minutes. 'Cause, God, the

show is killing me.  I got a

million appointments today.  It

just so happens it fell this way.

MICKEY

I gotta see new comedians later,

I've gotta--

HANNAH

(interrupting)

Two minutes on your sons' birthday.

You know, it's not going to kill you.

MICKEY

Happy Birthday, fellas!  Happy

Birthday!

HANNAH

(overlapping their

chatter, bending down

to talk to her sons)

Guys, look what Daddy brought.

Presents!

MICKEY

(to his sons)

Yeah, aren't you like, you know...

HANNAH

(overlapping)

Huh?

MICKEY

(continuing, holding

out his arms)

...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug!

What is this?  Now how 'bout a

little action from the kids?

MICKEY

(turning to Hannah)

How is everything?

HANNAH

(picking up the gift

on the sofa and nodding)

Everything's good.  Everything's

fine.

MICKEY

(nodding, overlapping)

Yeah?  Yeah?

(pointing)

Okay, kids, you can open the

presents now.

HANNAH

(overlapping)

Here, you guys.  Open them up.

MICKEY

Let me get a little reaction here.

(to Hannah, putting

his hands in his pockets)

How's Elliot?

HANNAH

He's fine.

MICKEY

Yeah?

HANNAH

(overlapping)

Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to

convince him to produce a play.

MICKEY

Oh!

HANNAH

I think he'll find that satisfying.

MICKEY

(nodding)

Really?  That'll be terrific for

him, I think.

HANNAH

I think so.

MICKEY

I like him.  I think he's a sweet

guy.

HANNAH

(stroking one of the

twins' backs)

Yeah.

MICKEY

The few times that I've met him...

(pointing to the

baseball mitt twin

#1, has taken out of

his box)

Isn't that a great mitt?

TWIN #1

Thank you, Daddy.

MICKEY

(overlapping to Hannah)

'Cause he's a loser.

HANNAH

(overlapping, to Twin #1)

Ohh!

MICKEY

(overlapping, gesturing)

H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy

like me...

HANNAH

(overlapping, chuckling)

I know, I know.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

...so I, so I like that.  I always

like an underconfident person...

HANNAH

(overlapping, touching

the mitt and reacting)

That's really nice!

MICKEY

(still rambling on,

gesturing to Hannah)

...you know?  I, uh...

HANNAH

(overlapping)

You know, he's been wanting a mitt.

MICKEY

You've always had good taste in

husbands, so...

HANNAH

(chuckling and nodding)

Thanks, thanks.

MICKEY

Mh-hm.

HANNAH

(leaning down to look

at the football)

That's a beauty!

MICKEY

Isn't that great?

HANNAH

Oh!

MICKEY

(pointing, to Twin #2)

Go right over there.

HANNAH

Football!

MICKEY

(to the offscreen twin)

Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!

HANNAH

(looking offscreen at

twin #2)

Wow!

MICKEY

(still pointing,

gearing up for the pass)

Go out, go out by the Sung vase

and, and catch this.

MICKEY

See?

(whistling)

HANNAH

(pointing offscreen)

Hey, d-- Watch, watch the picture.

CUT TO:

MICKEY (V.O.)

Gee, Hannah's sweet.  Although,

sometimes I still do get angry when

I think of things.  Oh, what the

hell.  At least, I'm not paying

child support.

(sighing)

Oh, God, I hope there's nothing

physically wrong with me, either.

DR. ABEL

(taking out Mickey's file)

So what's the, uh, problem this time?

MICKEY

(offscreen)

This time I really think I have

something.

MICKEY

(onscreen)

I mean, I'm absolutely convinced

that-that-- You know, I mean, it's

not like that adenoidal thing, you

know, where I didn't realize I had

them out.

MICKEY

(continuing, gesturing)

So, so, but it was when I was

younger, so--

DR. ABEL

(overlapping, interrupting)

You know, I saw your father this

week about his sinus...

MICKEY

(folding his arms on

his chest)

Mm-hm.

DR. ABEL

(continuing)

...and, uh, he complained of chest

pains.

MICKEY

Well, this guy's the real

hypochondriac of the family.  I

mean, he's, you know, he's--

DR. ABEL

(interrupting)

You mentioned on the phone that

you'd had some dizziness.

MICKEY

(rubbing his hands on

his knees)

Yes, a little dizziness, and I

think, I think I'm developing a

hearing loss in my right ear

(poking at his ears

and gesturing)

...or my left ear, my, my left...oh,

n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was

my right, my right, my right or my

left ear.

MICKEY

(nodding and gesturing)

Now I ca-can't remember.

DR. ABEL

Let's take a look.

DR. ABEL

Well, I'm sorry to say you have had

a significant drop in the high-

decibel range of your right ear.

MICKEY

(offscreen)

Really?!

DR. ABEL

(offscreen)

Have you been exposed to a loud

noise recently, or did you have a

virus?

MICKEY

(offscreen)

No, I-I've been perfectly healthy.

You know me.

MICKEY

(offscreen)

I always, I-I always imagine that I

have things.

DR. ABEL

(offscreen)

When did you first notice this?

MICKEY

(offscreen)

Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha-

what do I have?

DR. ABEL

You've had some dizzy spells.

(sighing)

What about ringing and buzzing?

Have you, uh, noticed any of that?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

Yes, now-now that you mention it,

uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and

also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing.

Um, am I going deaf, or something?

DR. ABEL

(making more notes in

the file)

And it's just in one ear?

MICKEY

(picking at his fingers)

Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to

have problems in both ears?

DR. ABEL

(his face offscreen)

What I'd like to do, is to make an

appointment for you at the hospital.

I'd like to have them run some tests.

MICKEY

The hospital?  What kind of tests?

DR. ABEL

(sighing)

Now, don't get alarmed.  These are

just more sophisticated audiometry

tests than I can run here.

(gesturing)

I mean, it's, it's nothing.

MICKEY

(gesturing)

Well, if it's nothing, then why do

I have to go into the hospital at

all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly

fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak

on the, on the high decibels.  So

I, you know, I won't go to the opera.

DR. ABEL

(sniffing)

You know, there's no reason for

panic.  I just want to rule out

some things.

MICKEY

Like what?

DR. ABEL

(shaking his head)

It's nothing.  Will you trust me?

CUT TO:

MICKEY

(into the telephone)

Huh, uh, hello, Dr. Wilkes?  Dr.

Wilkes, this is Mickey Sachs.  You

have a minute?  I want to ask you a

question.

DR. WILKES

(into the telephone)

Sure, Mickey.  What's up?

MICKEY

(into the telephone, gesturing)

I-if you have, i-if you have a

hearing loss in one ear, and-and

it's not from a, uh, virus or a

loud noise or anything, wh-what are

the possibilities?

DR. WILKES

(into his telephone)

Anything.  Uh, often it's hereditary.

Flu, uh, even a small noise will do

it.

MICKEY

(into the telephone)

Uh, right, but-but nothing worse?

DR. WILKES

(into the telephone)

Well, yes, I guess the, uh, dark

side of the spectrum is a brain

tumor.

MICKEY

(into the telephone,

reacting with a blank stare)

Really?

CUT TO:

GAIL

(handing them each

some pages of script)

Okay, so here's the new pages.

WOMAN

(looking over the pages)

Say, did cards get these?

GAIL

(scratching her head)

No, not yet.  No.

MAN

(looking over his pages)

Well, let's hope it's good.

GAIL

Yeah, really.  Really.

GAIL

Eh, we'll be down in a minute, okay?

GAIL

Mickey, what's the matter with you?

You're all white!

MICKEY

I feel dizzy.  Sshh, you know, I

don't feel well.

MICKEY

Do you hear a ringing?  Is there,

is there a, is there a ringing

sound?

(sighing)

GAIL

(gesturing)

Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I hear, I hear

it.

MICKEY

(shaking his head)

N-n-no, not that.

GAIL

(overlapping, into

the telephone)

Hello?

MICKEY

(covering first one

ear, then the other, continuing)

Like--

(putting a finger

into his ear, closing

his eyes and listening)

GAIL

(into the telephone)

Uh, yeah, yeah.  We're going to be

working late tonight.  N-no, we'll

order out.  It's all right.  Yeah.

MICKEY

(turning to Gail,

gesturing nervously)

Sssss, if I have a brain tumor, I

don't know what I'm gonna do.

(sighing)

GAIL

You don't have a brain tumor.  He

didn't say you had a brain tumor.

MICKEY

(sighing)

No, naturally

(gesturing)

they're not gonna tell you, because,

well, you know, th--, sometimes the

weaker ones will panic if you tell

'em.

GAIL

(pointing a finger at Mickey)

But not you.

MICKEY

(flinging up his

arms, sighing)

Oh, God!

(looking around

worriedly and touching

Gail's shoulder)

Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a

buzzing?

GAIL

(impatiently)

Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!

MICKEY

(pacing)

I can't keep my mind on the show.

GAIL

(offscreen)

But there's nothing wrong with you.

MICKEY

(sighing and gesturing)

If there's nothing wrong with me

(pacing back to the

desk and Gail)

then why does he want me to come

back for tests?!

GAIL

(gesturing)

Well, he has to rule out certain

things.

(sighing)

MICKEY

Like what?!  What?

GAIL

(shrugging)

I don't know.  Cancer, I--

MICKEY

(interrupting)

Don't say that!  I don't want to

hear that word!

(gesturing)

Don't mention that while I'm in the

building.

GAIL

(gesturing)

But you don't have any symptoms!

MICKEY

(gesturing)

You--I got the classic symptoms of

a brain tumor!

GAIL

Two months ago, you thought you had

a malignant melanoma.

MICKEY

(gesturing)

Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The

sudden appearance of a black spot

on my back!

GAIL

It was on your shirt!

MICKEY

(sighing)

I--How was I to know?!

(pointing to his back)

Everyone was pointing back here.

GAIL

Come on, we've got to make some

booking decisions.

MICKEY

I can't.  I can't think of it.

This morning, I was so happy, you

know.  Now I, I don't know what

went wrong.

(sighing)

GAIL

Eh, you were miserable this morning!

We got bad reviews, terrible

ratings, the sponsors are furious...

MICKEY

(pacing back to the

desk, still wringing

his hands)

No, I was happy, but I just didn't

realize I was happy.

CUT TO:

The Stanislavski Catering Company in action.

FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST

(offscreen)

These things are delicious!  What

in the world are they?

HOLLY

Oh, um, those are quail eggs.

FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST

(offscreen)

Oh, they're very good.

HOLLY

(nodding)

Yeah, my friend April makes those.

(holding out the tray)

Here, try the shrimp puffs.  These

are delicious.

FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST

(taking one from the tray)

Oh, thank you.  That looks great.

HOLLY

I make those.

FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST

Mmm.  Thanks.

HOLLY

(to two male guests

in her way)

Excuse me.

HOLLY

(to the man)

Thank you.

APRIL

(offscreen)

The Stroganoff is ready.

HOLLY

(animatedly)

We're a big hit.

APRIL

Oh, in this we're a big hit.

Yesterday I auditioned for Come

Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't

such a big hit.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

You will be.  You will be.  You'll

get five jobs next week.

DAVID

(to Holly)

Excuse me, are there any more claims?

HOLLY

(gesturing at some

canapes warming on

the stove)

Only a few.  A few.

(chuckling as David

takes one)

Do you like 'em?

DAVID

I can't resist.

HOLLY

(busily working at

the stove)

Really?  How flattering!  Did you

try the shrimp puffs?

DAVID

(eating a canape and

pointing at Holly)

Listen, you guys are too attractive

to be caterers.  Something's wrong.

HOLLY

We're actresses.

DAVID

Is this your first job?

HOLLY

(grabbing a quiche

from an overhead stove)

Really?  Is the food that bad?

DAVID

(shaking his head)

Oh no.  Not at all.

APRIL

We need more bread and some baked

lasa--

(realizing Holly

isn't there and, at

the same time,

noticing David)

uh, lasagne.

(turning to David)

Hi.

DAVID

(standing by the sink

as he wipes his hands

and mouth with a napkin)

I know.  You're an actress with a

great flair for shrimp puffs.

APRIL

(working at the

stove, pointing a

finger for emphasis)

Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are

Holly's.  I do the, uh, crepes

caviar.

DAVID

And the quail is responsible for

the quail eggs.

APRIL

(turning to David and chuckling)

Well, let's hope so.

HOLLY

Here, I stole you a couple of extra

clams.

DAVID

(taking the plate)

Ah!

HOLLY

(looking busily

around the room)

Now.

DAVID

(overlapping, gesturing)

Incidentally, I'm David Tolchin.

APRIL

(turning to David)

Oh, uh, April Knox.  Hi.

DAVID

(looking at her)

Hi.

APRIL

(leaving the counter

and squeezing past

David and Holly)

Oh.

HOLLY

(overlapping, moving

out of April's way)

I'm sorry.

DAVID

(overlapping Holly's

apology, turning to her)

You're Holly.

HOLLY

(nodding, looking at

David as she wipes

her hands with the napkin)

Yeah, we're the Stanislavski

Catering Company.

DAVID

(chewing on a clam canape)

Now I'm going to tell you the truth.

I really came in here because I was

bored stiff by the party.

HOLLY

(laughing, still

wiping her hands)

What makes you think we're more

interesting?

DAVID

(turning on the set)

Actually, I'm going to listen to

Aida, if I'm not getting in your way.

APRIL

(offscreen)

No...no.  No--

(sniffing)

HOLLY

(offscreen, overlapping)

Not at all.

HOLLY

(gesturing, fiddling

with another napkin)

We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in

Ernani at the Met, and I cried...

DAVID

(nodding, his hand

still on his watch as

he looks at Holly)

I cry at the opera.

APRIL

(offscreen)

Oh, I-I-I go limp in the last scene

in La Traviata.  Limp.

DAVID

(nodding, to April)

Me, too.  I have a private box at

the Met.

(gesturing)

I bring my little bottle of wine, I

open it, I sit there and I watch

and

(glancing over to the

offscreen Holly)

I cry.  It's disgusting.

HOLLY

(gesturing)

Oh, what, what do you do?

DAVID

(nodding)

I'm an architect.

APRIL

Wha--

(turning to glance at Holly)

What kind of things do you build?

DAVID

Are you really interested?

APRIL

Yeah.

HOLLY

(nodding)

Yeah.

DAVID

What time do you get off?

CUT TO:

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Wow, it's the red one?

APRIL

(offscreen)

Oh, it's magnificent!

DAVID

(offscreen)

Yeah.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

It's terrific!

DAVID

(gesturing, looking

back and forth from

the buildings to

Holly and April)

The design's deliberately

noncontextural.  But I wanted to...

keep the atmosphere of the street,

you know, and the proportions.

HOLLY

(nodding)

Uh-huh.

DAVID

And in the material.

That's...that's unpolished red

granite.

(pausing as he

watches Holly and

April's reaction)

HOLLY

Oh!

APRIL

(overlapping)

Oh, is that what it is?

HOLLY

(starting to speak)

Uh--

APRIL

(interrupting,

nodding at Holly)

I-i-it has an o-organic quality,

you know.

HOLLY

(nodding, overlapping)

Right.

APRIL

(looking back at the

building with reverence)

It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely

wholly interdependent, if you know

what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it

into words.  The important thing

is-is-is it-it breathes.

DAVID

(turning to April, emphatically)

You know, April, people pass by

vital structures in this city all

the time, and they never take the

time to appreciate them.  I get the

feeling you tune in to your

environment.

APRIL

(shaking her head)

Oh--

HOLLY

(interrupting,

gesturing and nodding)

Oh, it's really important.

APRIL

(looking only at David)

What are your favorite buildings,

David?

DAVID

You want to see some?

APRIL

(nodding)

Oh, yeah.

DAVID

Well, let's do it.

APRIL

(looking at David)

Great.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just

want to put on a long gown...

DAVID

(offscreen, overlapping)

Yes.

HOLLY

(offscreen, continuing)

...and open the French doors and go

on the balcony --

APRIL

(offscreen, interrupting)

It's French, though.  It really is.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Yeah.

APRIL

(offscreen, overlapping)

It feels like you're in France.

DAVID

(offscreen, overlapping)

It-it is.  It's romantic.

DAVID

(offscreen)

And it's got a handsome partner

sitting right beside it.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Yeah.

DAVID

(offscreen, overlapping)

They fit right in together.  And

your eye goes along, lulled into

complacency, and then...

APRIL

(offscreen)

That's just --

DAVID

(offscreen, interrupting)

Look at this.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

That's disgusting!

APRIL

(offscreen, continuing)

...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?

HOLLY

(offscreen, overlapping)

It's really terrible.

DAVID

(offscreen, emphatically)

It's really sad.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

And it ruins everything else.

DAVID

(offscreen, agreeing)

It does.

APRIL

(offscreen)

Well...we have seen a lot of stuff

today, though.

HOLLY

(offscreen, chuckling)

Yeah.

DAVID

(offscreen, overlapping)

Yeah.

APRIL

(offscreen, overlapping)

A lot of works.

HOLLY

(nodding)

Yeah.

DAVID

(glancing at his watch)

Maybe we should start thinking

about going home, huh?

HOLLY

Fast.

APRIL

Oh, geez, yeah.

HOLLY

(overlapped)

Okay.

DAVID

(looking back at the

women as he walks

around the car to the

driver's side)

Uh, who gets dropped first?

APRIL

Uh --

HOLLY

(overlapping, looking

at April)

Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...

DAVID

(offscreen, overlapping)

Well...

APRIL

(overlapping)

Well, I live downtown.

HOLLY

(glancing at April)

Yeah, I, we both live downtown.

APRIL

(gesturing)

Uh...

HOLLY

(to David)

It depends on what way you want to

go.

APRIL

(overlapping)

Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.

HOLLY

Uh...

APRIL

(to Holly, gesturing)

If...well, if we took the, if we

took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get

to your house first, yeah?

DAVID

(overlapping, nodding)

We could...we could do that.

HOLLY

(nodding)

Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so

jammed, isn't it?

APRIL

(overlapping, to Holly)

Well, sometimes, some, uh...

HOLLY

(interrupting)

I mean, it's jammed.  If we went...

um...

DAVID

(pointing to Holly,

interrupting their chatter)

Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?

HOLLY

(nodding at David)

Yes.

DAVID

Well, I-I guess if you live in

Chelsea, that's probably first.

HOLLY

(nodding nervously)

Oh, okay.

APRIL

Yeah.

DAVID

And then, uh, April...huh?

APRIL

(overlapping, nodding)

Great.

HOLLY (V.O.)

Naturally I get taken home first.

Well, obviously he prefers April.

Of course I was so tongue-tied all

night.  I can't believe I said that

about the Guggenheim.  My stupid

little roller-skating joke.  I

should never tell jokes.  Mom can

tell 'em and Hannah, but I kill 'em.

(glaring at the

offscreen April's back)

Where did April come up with that

stuff about Adolph Loos and terms

like "organic form"?

(looking out the side

window, pausing for a moment)

Well, naturally.  She went to

Brandeis.

HOLLY (V.O.)

But I don't think she knows what

she's talking about.  Could you

believe the way she was calling him

David? "Yes, David.  I feel that

way, too, David.  What a marvelous

space, David."

(emphatically)

I hate April.  She's pushy.

HOLLY (V.O.)

Now they'll dump me and she'll

invite him up.  I blew it.

(sighing, looking out

the side window)

And I really like him a lot.  Oh,

screw it.  I'm not gonna get all

upset.  I've got reading to do

tonight.  You know, maybe I'll get

into bed early.  I'll turn to a

movie and take an extra Seconal.

Oh, Elliot!

ELLIOT

Hi.

LEE

What are you doing here?

ELLIOT

(looking around, gesturing)

Well, I'm-I'm looking for a

bookstore.

LEE

(shaking her head)

Oh, what, in this section of town?

ELLIOT

Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--

LEE

(overlapping)

You're out looking here?

ELLIOT

(glancing at his

Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I

Ohhhh!

ELLIOT

(gesturing)

How about you?

LEE

Oh.  Well, I live--

ELLIOT

(interrupting, chuckling)

Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't

you?

LEE

(overlapping, chuckling)

Yes, I do.

ELLIOT

(putting his hands

behind his back)

Where are you headed?

LEE

Oh, I was just going to my AA

meeting.

ELLIOT

Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you

still go to those?  You never tough

alcohol.

LEE

(laughing)

Well, listen, you didn't know me

before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start

with a beer at about ten in the

morning, and...go on.

ELLIOT

(looking at Lee)

Oh.  You must have been, uh, very

unhappy.

LEE

Yeah, unhappy and fat.

(chuckling)

And I still find the meetings very

comforting, you know.

ELLIOT

I'll never understand it.  You're

so bright and charming and beautiful.

LEE

(laughing)

Oh, God.

ELLIOT

(overlapping, chuckling)

I think to myself

(laughing)

what problems could she possibly

have?

LEE

(gesturing, laughing)

Don't let me get started on my

childhood.

(stopping in her

tracks, remembering)

Oh, you know what?  There is a

bookstore.

ELLIOT

(stopping alongside her)

Yes?

LEE

(overlapping, pointing)

A couple of blocks from here.  If

you don't know about it, you should.

You'd really love it.

ELLIOT

Yes?

LEE

(nodding)

Yeah, you would.

ELLIOT

(looking around for a

moment, then gesturing

to Lee)

Well, i-if-if you have some free

time...

LEE

(nodding)

Yeah, sure.

(chuckling)

ELLIOT

Thank you.

LEE

(offscreen)

Isn't this great?

(chuckling)

They have everything here.

ELLIOT

(offscreen, distracted)

Yes, it's-it's wonderful.

LEE

(offscreen)

What book did you want to buy?

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

What?  Book?

LEE

(offscreen)

Your book?  You wanted to buy a book?

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...

(laughing)

I'm killing time.  I...I-I just,

uh, w-want to browse, uh...

LEE

(looking up at a row

of books)

Well, you sure picked the right

place.  I mean, you can stay here

all afternoon, not buy anything and

just read.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

Unless, of course, if-if you had

some time, I mean, we could get

some coffee.

LEE

No, I don't have time.

ELLIOT

(gesturing)

No, no.  I-I-I understand completely.

No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...

LEE

(offscreen, chuckling)

You seem tense.  Is everything all

right?  You feel okay?

ELLIOT

(overlapping)

No!  No...

LEE

(offscreen)

No?

ELLIOT

(gesturing, looking

at books)

Uh, yes!

LEE

(offscreen)

Yes?

ELLIOT

(offscreen

momentarily, hidden

by a shelf as he talks)

Yes.

LEE

(offscreen)

Everything's okay?

(chuckling)

ELLIOT

Yeah.  How are you?

LEE

(offscreen)

I'm...all right.

ELLIOT

(offscreen

momentarily, hidden

by another shelf as

he walks)

How-how's Frederick?

LEE

(offscreen)

Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio

exhibition at the Met.  It's such a

treat to go through a museum with

Frederick.  I mean...you learn so

much.  Do you like Caravaggio?

ELLIOT

(turning to talk to

the offscreen Lee)

Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?

(pointing)

Look!

ELLIOT

(pointing to a book

on a shelf, continuing)

e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you

this.

LEE

(offscreen, laughing)

Oh, no, I can't let you get me that.

That's too much.

ELLIOT

(pulling the book off

the shelf and browsing

through it)

Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh,

uh, very much.

LEE

(offscreen)

No, I don't think so.

ELLIOT

(gesturing with the

book, looking at the

offscreen Lee)

I-I read a poem of you and thought

of his last week.

(nervously laughing,

trying to correct his mistake)

A poem of

(laughing)

his and thought of you last--

(laughing)

You'll be fine, though.

(chuckling)

LEE

(overlapping)

Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I

love e.e. cummings, but I can't let

you get this.

ELLIOT

(overlapping, patting

the book)

Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love

to get you this.

LEE

(looking down at the book)

Well, sure.

ELLIOT

(overlapping)

And-and maybe, um...maybe we could

discuss it sometime.

LEE

(laughing, holding up

the bag)

Well, thanks a lot.

ELLIOT

(pointing to the bookstore)

Thanks for showing me the bookstore.

Perhaps you could, uh, take me to

an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh,

I'd love to see what goes on.

LEE

(nodding)

Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it.

It's really entertaining.  You'd

have a good time.

(stepping closer to

the curb and hailing

a cab)

I know you would.

ELLIOT

(pointing to the book)

And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on

page a hundred and twelve.  It

reminded me of you.

LEE

(laughing)

Really?  Well...

ELLIOT

(leaning down to talk

to Lee in the cab)

Page a hundred and twelve.

LEE

Bye.

ELLIOT

(closing the taxi

door for Lee)

Bye.

CUT TO:

LEE (V.O.)

(reading)

"your slightest look easily will

unclose me

though I have closed myself as

fingers,

you open always petal by petal

myself...

LEE (V.O.)

(continuing reading)

"...as Spring opens

[touching skillfully, mysteriously]

her first rose

[i do not know what it is about you

that closes and opens;

only something in me understands

the voice of your eyes is deeper

than

all roses]...

LEE (V.O.)

(continuing reading)

"nobody, not even the rain, has

such small hands."

CUT TO:

The anxiety of the man in the booth.

CUT TO:

DR. GREY

I wasn't too happy with the results

of your ENG or your BSER either.

DR. GREY

Uh, which is why I sent you to

Tomography, which was all that

stuff you saw rolling around.

(pointing to a spot

on one of the X-rays)

You see this little gray area here?

DR. GREY

That gray area's what I had hoped

that we wouldn't run into.  I'd

like you to come in Monday morning

for, uh, a CAT scan.

MICKEY

(reacting)

A brain scan?

DR. GREY

(gesturing)

Mr. Sachs, let's take one step at a

time.  We won't make any decisions

until we have all the information

in front of us, all right?

CUT TO:

MICKEY (V.O.)

Okay...take it easy.  He didn't say

you had anything.  He just doesn't

like the spot on your X-ray, that's

all.  It doesn't mean you have

anything.  Don't jump to conclusions.

(sighing)

Nothing's gonna happen to you.

You're in the middle of New York

City.  This is your town.  You're

surrounded by people and traffic

and restaurants.

MICKEY (V.O.)

I mean, God, how can you, how can

you just one day...vanish?  Keep

calm.  You're gonna be okay.  Don't

panic.

CUT TO:

MICKEY (V.O.)

I'm dying!  I'm dying!  I know it!

There's a spot on my lungs!

(sitting up, putting

on his glasses)

All right now, take it easy, will

you?  It's not on your lungs.  It's

on your ear.  No, it's the same

thing, isn't it?

(pulling the sheets

off and sitting on

the edge of his bed)

Oh, jeez, I can't sleep!  Oh, God,

there's a tumor in my head the size

of a basketball!

(putting on his slippers)

N-now I keep thinking I can feel it

every time I blink!  Oh, Jesus!

He-he-he wants me to do a brain

scan to confirm what he already

suspects.

MICKEY (V.O.)

(running his hand

along a banister)

Look...I'll make a deal with God.

Let it just be my ear, okay?  I'll

go deaf.  I'll go deaf and blind in

one eye maybe.  But I don't want a

brain operation!  Once they go into

my skull, I'll-I'll wind up like

the guy with the, with the wool cap

who delivers for the florist!

MICKEY (V.O.)

Oh, relax, will ya?  Your whole

life you run to doctors.  The news

is always fine.

(pausing at the

bottom of the stairs)

That's not true.  What about years

ago?

DR. SMITH

(gesturing with one hand)

I'm sorry to say, Mr. Sachs, that

you cannot have children.

MICKEY

(reacting, putting

his hands across his chest)

Gee.

HANNAH

(reacting)

Is there no chance?

DR. SMITH

(getting up from his desk)

Well, naturally, this doesn't mean

that you can't have a normal sex

life.

(walking over to the

opened office door

and closing it)

But Mr. Sachs's tests indicate that

he is infertile.  Small sperm

volume and infertile.

MICKEY

(gesturing, looking

up at an offscreen Dr.

Smith)

Isn't there anything I can do?

Push-ups or hormones?

DR. SMITH

(offscreen)

I'm afraid not.

MICKEY

Well, I gotta get a second opinion.

HANNAH

(turning to Mickey)

This is the second opinion.

MICKEY

(shrugging)

Well, then a third opinion.

DR. SMITH

I realize this is a blow.  My

experience is that many very fine

marriages become unstable and are

destroyed by an inability to deal

with this sort of problem.  I hope

you won't make too much of it.  One

can adopt children, and there are

various artificial methods of

fertilization.

CUT TO:

MICKEY

(gesturing)

I'm so humiliated.  I don't know

what to say.  I mean--

HANNAH

(interrupting, wiping

her eyes with her tissue)

Could you have ruined yourself

somehow?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

How could I ruin myself?  What do

you mean, ruin myself?

HANNAH

(overlapping, looking

at Mickey)

I don't know.  Excessive

masturbation?

MICKEY

Hey, you gonna start knocking my

hobbies?  Jesus!

MICKEY

Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child.

He said you could adopt one--

HANNAH

(interrupting)

Well, what about artificial

insemination?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

What are you talking about?

HANNAH

(overlapping)

You know, where I-I-I would get

implanted from a-a donor.

MICKEY

(reacting)

What, by a st-stranger?

HANNAH

Yeah, they have these banks, you

know, where they keep them frozen.

MICKEY

(gesturing)

Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid?

Is that your idea?

HANNAH

I want to experience childbirth.

MICKEY

With a, with a stranger?  With a--

HANNAH

(interrupting, sniffing)

Just think about it.  That's all I

ask.

CAROL

(putting down her cup)

Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I

think that's the best show you two

ever wrote.

NORMAN

(holding his cup,

pointing emphatically)

No, the funniest show that Mickey

and I ever did was the one we won

the Emmy for.

MICKEY

Yeah...I-I think as, I think as far

as laughs, I mean just plain

laughs, you know, that was probably

the best thing that we ever did.

NORMAN

(agreeing)

Mm-hm.

CAROL

(overlapping, her

hands over her

crossed knees and nodding)

Yeah, it was funny, it was very

funny.  But the show was about the

two Frenchmen, now that was funny

and it was warm.

NORMAN

(to Carol, gesturing

with his cup)

We got that idea on that trip to

Paris.

CAROL

(nodding)

Right.

NORMAN

(smiling)

Hmm?

CAROL

(to the offscreen Hannah)

Do you remember that summer in

France?  Hannah, you had jet lag

for six straight weeks.

MICKEY

(sighing, almost mumbling)

Yeah, but it was, you know, I guess

we had fun when we were there and,

you know, it's just, I--

NORMAN

(overlapping, nodding)

Mm-hm.

HANNAH

(to Mickey)

Sorry.

(to Norman and Carol)

Coffee?  Listen, you guys, we

were-- You want some more?

NORMAN

(holding out his cup)

Mmm.

HANNAH

(refilling Norman's cup)

We-we...we had something we-we

really wanted to discuss with you.

MICKEY

(overlapping, coughing)

Yeah...

MICKEY

(standing up and gesturing)

Jeez, this is, this is, this is

very delicate and-and I only bring

this up amongst friends, you know.

MICKEY

(turning to the group

as he paces behind

the couch)

I mean...

(grunting)

this is, uh... this should not go

any further than this room.

NORMAN

(sipping his coffee)

I'm all ears.

MICKEY

(gesturing and pacing)

Hannah and I...can't have any

children.  Now I-I-I don't want to

get into whose fault it--

(gesturing)

It's my fault that we can't and-

and-and the details are too

embarrassing to--

HANNAH

(interrupting,

nervously picking at

her fingers)

W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of

discussion that we-we'd try with

artificial insemination.

MICKEY

(putting his hands on

his hips)

Yeah, I'm not so sure that I, that

I like that idea myself, anyway--

HANNAH

(overlapping)

Um, I-I didn't really want to, you

know, go to a sperm bank or

something, have some anonymous

donor.

(gesturing at Norman

and Carol)

I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't

want that.

MICKEY

(pacing)

Right.  We felt that if we were

gonna do it, that we would like

somebody who we knew and who we

liked and who was warm and bright

and...

HANNAH

And you can say no... you know.

Feel free to say no.  W-we realize

it has all kinds of implications.

MICKEY

Yeah, but the-the point that, uh,

that we're making here is that we

need some sperm.

NORMAN

(sighing)

Gee.

(chuckling)

Well... My first reaction after the

initial shock is, uh, flattered

that you would ask me.

(chuckling nervously)

MICKEY

(pointing at himself)

Yeah, well, I would be the father.

(pointing to Norman)

You would just have to masturbate

into a little cup.

NORMAN

(shrugging)

I can handle that.

HANNAH

(scooting closer to

Carol and Norman on

the couch, gesturing)

Obviously we wou-wouldn't have

intercourse.

CAROL

(to Hannah, chuckling

nervously briefly)

Gosh, listen.

(rubbing her nose)

I've gotta tell you the truth here.

I'm a little uneasy about this.

HANNAH

(putting her hand on

Carol's shoulder)

Carol, I know it's a lot to ask.

CAROL

(gesturing)

Well...I feel for you.  I do.

I...I'm gonna cry.  You want my

husband to have a child with you?

HANNAH

(gesturing)

Ye-- D-d-d-don't answer now.  Just,

you know, take it home and think

about it for a while.

NORMAN

(holding his coffee

cup, thoughtful)

I gave blood before and, uh...

clothing to the poor.

CAROL

(to Norman, scratching

her ear)

Okay, Norman, listen, I really want

to talk about this at home.

(nodding as Hannah

looks briefly

offscreen at Mickey)

I think it's a matter for your

analyst...and mine.

NORMAN

(emphatically)

And maybe my lawyer.

HANNAH

(gesturing)

You know, we-we understand

completely if, you know, if you

feel you'd-you'd rather not.

(chuckling nervously)

I didn't mean to spoil the evening.

(rubbing her hands)

Now let's move on to another topic.

MICKEY (V.O.)

So you had my ex-partner's baby.

Twins.  Maybe that did cause some

trouble, but

(sighing)

I think we were drifting apart

anyhow.  Now instead of man and

wife we're just good friends.  Boy,

love is really unpredictable.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

Dusty bought this huge house in Southampton.

ELLIOT

(leading the way into

the loft, gesturing)

Lee, Frederick...say hello to Dusty

Frye.

LEE

(shaking Dusty's hand)

Hi, Dusty.

DUSTY

Hi.

ELLIOT

(as he walks)

Dusty's just bought a huge house in

Southampton and he's in the process

of decorating it.

DUSTY

Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place,

actually.  A lotta wall space.

(chuckling)

LEE

Oh.

DUSTY

(to Frederick, giving

him a "hip" handshake)

How ya doin', man?

ELLIOT

(to a less than

enthusiastic Frederick)

I told him about your work, and

he's very excited.

DUSTY

Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I

got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's

very beautiful.

(gesturing)

Big, weird...you know.

(chuckling as he

crosses his arms on

his chest)

If you stare at that Stella too

long, the colors just seem to float.

It's kinda weird.

LEE

(chuckling, her arms crossed)

Are you excited about becoming a

collector?

DUSTY

Yeah.

LEE

(nodding)

Yeah?

DUSTY

(shrugging)

I got a lot more to learn, though.

I really wasn't into art when I was

a kid.

LEE

(nodding)

Uh-huh.

FREDERICK

(addressing but not

looking at Dusty)

Do you appreciate drawings?

DUSTY

(shrugging)

Yeah.

(chuckling as he

notices and points to

some offscreen

drawings Frederick

has set up)

Oh!  Hey!  Wow!

(pointing to an

offscreen nude drawing)

She's beautiful.  But, uh, really,

I-I-I-I need something... I'm

looking for something big.

LEE

(looking at an

offscreen Frederick, gesturing)

Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.

FREDERICK

(offscreen)

They're in the basement.

LEE

(to Dusty)

Frederick's done this whole new

series that I'm sure you would

really love.

DUSTY

(overlapping, muttering)

Well, are...are they big?

LEE

Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of

them are very big.

DUSTY

'Cause I got a lot of wall space

there.

(chuckling)

FREDERICK

(angrily stopping in

his tracks)

I don't sell my work by the yard!

LEE

(chuckling, reacting)

Oh, Frederick!

ELLIOT

(chuckling softly)

How's everything?

LEE

(walking onscreen

towards Elliot)

Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah

this morning on the phone, and she

said that you two might be going to

the country for the weekend.

ELLIOT

Yeah, she loves to go out in the

woods.

LEE

(nodding, her arms

clasped around her chest)

Oh, yeah.

ELLIOT

(chuckling)

But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.

LEE

I have to get my teeth cleaned this

week.

ELLIOT

Oh, that's nice.

ELLIOT

(breaking the silence,

pointing in the

direction of the door)

I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick

and Dusty together.

LEE

(looking in the same

direction, gesturing)

Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.

ELLIOT

Yes.  This kid, he's earned a

trillion dollars.

LEE

(nodding, wrapping

her arms around her

chest again)

Oh.

ELLIOT

He's got like six gold records.

LEE

(gesturing, relieved

that she's found

something to say)

Oh, speaking of records...I bought

that Mozart Trio you recommended...

LEE

(continuing)

...and the man in the record shop

showed me another one that I think

you'd love.  It's a... another

Bach, second movement.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

Oh, you-you have that one?

LEE

(working at the

stereo, turning her

head towards Elliot)

Yeah.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

Oh, I would love to hear it.

LEE

(putting the turntable

cover in place)

Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man

who loves opera.  An architect.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see

her wind up settled.  She's a tense

one.

(chuckling)

LEE

(intently)

Isn't that beautiful?

ELLIOT

(looking at Lee, his

hands clasped in

front of him)

I know this.  Bach.  F Minor

Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.

ELLIOT

(after a pause)

Uh...did you ever get around to e.e.

cummings?

LEE

(wrapping her arms

around her chest and

looking away from

Elliot for a moment)

Yes, he's just adorable.

LEE

(awkwardly)

They have a very large gay

clientele, you know, where I get my

teeth cleaned, and...all the

hygienists now wear gloves because

they're afraid of AIDS.

ELLIOT

(taking a breath)

Oh, right.

ELLIOT

(softly)

Did you ever get around to the poem

on page a hundred and twelve?

LEE

Yes, it made me cry

(tentatively looking

at Elliot)

it was so beautiful...so romantic.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

I want so badly to kiss her.  Not

here, you idiot.  You've got to get

her alone someplace.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

But I've got to proceed cautiously.

This is a very delicate situation.

Okay, uh...ask her if you can see

her for lunch or a drink tomorrow.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

And be ready to make light of the

offer if she's unresponsive.  This

has to be done very skillfully,

very diplomatically.

LEE

(showing Elliot a

poem in her book)

Did you ever read this one--?

LEE

Elliot!  Don't!

ELLIOT

Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with

you.

ELLIOT

(breathing hard)

Oh!

LEE

(gasping)

What are you doing?!

ELLIOT

(frantically)

I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have

to talk to you for... There's so

much that I want to tell you.

LEE

(still gasping)

Elliot!

ELLIOT

(gesturing desperately)

I have been in love with you for so

long.

FREDERICK

(angrily)

Please forget it!  I don't have any

interest in selling anything!

DUSTY

(gesturing)

I ask you if you have something

with a little puce in it, you gotta

fly off the handle!

LEE

(in a slightly

higher-pitched voice)

What's the problem?

FREDERICK

(pulling the nude

drawings off his

easel angrily)

I'm not interested in what your

interior decorator would think,

okay?!

DUSTY

(overlapping, gesturing)

Well, I can't commit to anything

without consulting her first.

That's what I have her for, okay?

FREDERICK

(carrying the drawings

off)

This is degrading!  You don't buy

paintings to blend in with the sofa!

DUSTY

(looking after Frederick)

It's not a sofa, it's an ottoman!

(touching his

forehead, turning to Elliot)

God, forget it!  Let's just get

outta here, Elliot.

ELLIOT

(putting down the book)

We'll go.

DUSTY

(angrily, getting

into the car)

What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.

(noticing Elliot's

anguished face)

What's the matter with you?

ELLIOT

(gesturing)

Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.

DUSTY

(overlapping)

It's not that big a deal.  We just

didn't hit it off.

ELLIOT

(gesturing)

Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.

DUSTY

Are you okay?  You look-- You're

sweatin'.

ELLIOT

(overlapping, nervously)

Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so-

some-some fresh air.  It's probably

something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk.

You go ahead.

ELLIOT

(continuing, gesturing)

You go.  Go on.  Go.

FREDERICK

(into the telephone)

Hello?  Hello?  Hello?

LEE

(gesturing in relief)

Oh!  There you are!

LEE

I was looking for you.

ELLIOT

(gesturing)

I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm

sorry.  I'm so mixed up.

LEE

(gesturing)

Well, how do you expect me to react

to such a thing?

ELLIOT

(taking Lee's arm)

Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am

in love with you.

LEE

Oh, don't say those words!

ELLIOT

(overlapping, shaking

his head)

I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's

terrible.

LEE

(pushing back her

hair, shaking her

head hopelessly)

Why, you know the situation.

ELLIOT

(looking away for a moment)

I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.

LEE

What do you expect me to say?

ELLIOT

Hannah and I are in the last stages.

LEE

(shaking her head)

Wh-- She's never said anything, and

we're very close.  She'd tell me

such a thing.

ELLIOT

Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad.

She's crazy about me, but somewhere

on the, along the line, I've fallen

out of love with her.

LEE

Not because of me, I hope.

ELLIOT

Oh, no, no.

(nodding)

Well, yes!  I love you.

LEE

Oh, I can't be the cause of anything

between you and Hannah.  I jus--

ELLIOT

(overlapping, shaking

his head)

Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it-

it was i-inevitable that Hannah and

I part, anyway.

LEE

Why?

ELLIOT

Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.

LEE

(gesturing)

But not over me?

ELLIOT

Tch, no!  We were, we were both

going in different directions.

LEE

(looking down)

Poor Hannah.

ELLIOT

But-but, but how about you?  Do

you, do you share any of my feelings?

Or is this just an unpleasant

embarrassment to you?

LEE

(reacting uneasily)

I can't say anything!

ELLIOT

W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I

don't want you to feel bad.

LEE

(putting her hand to

her head)

Yes!  But I...I have certain

feelings for you, but don't make me

say anything more, all right?

ELLIOT

(gesturing)

O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You,

you, y-you've said enough.  It's my

responsibility now.  I will work

things out.

LEE

Look, don't do anything on my

behalf.

(shaking her head)

I live with Frederick, and Hannah

and I are close.

ELLIOT

Yes, but you, you do care about me.

LEE

(reacting)

Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a

party to this!  I'm suddenly

wracked with guilt just standing

her talking to you on the street!

ELLIOT

(emphatically)

Your guilt is because you feel the

same.

LEE

(reacting)

Oh, please, I have to go.  I have

to get my teeth cleaned.

ELLIOT

(happily)

I have my answer.  I have my answer!

I'm walking on air!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HANNAH

(distracted)

Hi.  How's she doing?

EVAN

(overlapping)

I am glad to see you.

EVAN

She's in the kitchen there.  It's

the same thing.  Same thing.  She

promises, promises.

(gesturing)

But it's all lies.

HANNAH

(offscreen, patiently)

Don't make it worse, Dad.

EVAN

(overlapping)

Always.

HANNAH

Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let

me get you some coffee.  That's

enough of that.

(taking away her

mother's drink, to Evan)

What triggered it?

EVAN

(gesturing, as Norma

turns her head and

watches him)

We were making a commercial down at

the mayor's office, and there was

this young, good-looking salesman...

EVAN

(continuing)

...and your mother was throwing

herself at him in a disgusting way,

and when she found she was too old

to seduce him, that he was just

embarrassed by her--

NORMA

(angrily interrupting,

turning her head)

Liar!  Liar!

EVAN

Then at lunch she got drunker and

drunker

(shouting over his shoulder)

and finally she became Joan Collins!

NORMA

(offscreen)

All my life I've had to put up with

insults...

NORMA

(continuing, dramatically)

...from this non-person, this, th-

th-this haircut that passes for a

man.

(turning to look at

the offscreen Hannah)

He could never support us.  It's a

good thing we had a talented

daughter!

EVAN

I can only hope that she was mine.

With you as her mother

(gesturing, his voice

getting louder)

her father could be anybody in

Actors' Equity!

NORMA

She's talented...so it's not likely

she's yours!

(taking a sip of water)

HANNAH

(walking over to the

doorway to speak to

Evan, who's already

fuming in the den)

Dad, could you just please stay in

the other room and let me take care

of her?

EVAN

(offscreen, choosing

to ignore Hannah's suggestion)

You never know when she's going to

fall off the wagon and humiliate

everybody.

HANNAH

Here, Mom.  Drink this.

(leaning against a

kitchen counter)

You know, you're awful.  You

probably were flirting.

NORMA

(sipping her coffee)

No!  I like to joke around and have

fun, and he gets angry because I

get the attention.  He's gotten

sourer as he's gotten older, and

I've tried to stay young...at heart.

HANNAH

You promised to stay on the wagon.

NORMA

(shaking her head)

The sacrifices I've made because of

that man.

(inhaling)

He's ruined me with his ego, his

philandering, his--

(gesturing)

his-his-his-his mediocrity!

HANNAH

Okay, stop being so dramatic.

NORMA

(shouting to the

offscreen Evan)

He's the one that's made every

ingenue in stock!

HANNAH

(quietly)

Okay, okay.

NORMA

(touching Hannah's

arm, gasping)

Th-th-they, they wanted me for a

screen test.

HANNAH

(patiently)

Yeah, I know, Mom.

NORMA

(gesturing)

But I, I knew that he'd get up

there and he'd flounder around with

his expensive haircuts and hairdos

and clothes.  He's all show!

(touching Hannah's

arm again, then

touching her chest)

Now how can you act when there's

nothing inside to come out?!

HANNAH (V.O.)

She was so beautiful at one time,

and he was so dashing.  Both of

them just full of promise and hopes

that never materialized.

HANNAH (V.O.)

And the fights and the constant

infidelities to prove

themselves...and blaming each other.

It's s-sad.  They loved the idea of

having us kids, but raising us

didn't interest them much.  But

it's impossible to hold it against

them.  They didn't know anything

else.

NORMA

You know, of all of us in the

family, you were the one blessed

with the true gift.

HANNAH

(holding the hand her

mother had placed on

her shoulder)

Ohhh, my true gift is luck, Mom.

HANNAH

(overlapping)

I just had a lot of luck...from my

first show, you know?  I've always

thought Lee was the one destined

for great things.

NORMA

Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't

have your spark.

(gesturing and chuckling)

She knows it.  She worships you.

She wouldn't dare get up there on

the stage.

HANNAH

(looking at her mother)

Now, Holly's not shy.

NORMA

No, Holly's game for anything.

Holly takes after me.

HANNAH

True.

NORMA

(shaking her head)

I'd have been a great dope addict.

EVAN

(looking up)

Remember this, Hannah?

DR. BROOKS

Mr. Sachs,

(sighing)

I'm afraid the news is not good.

DR. BROOKS

(continuing, taking a

pencil out of his pocket)

If I can show you exactly where the

tumor is, and why we feel that

surgery would be of no use.

MICKEY (V.O.)

It's over.  I'm face-to-face with

eternity.

DR. BROOKS

(offscreen)

...grown quite large without being

detected...

(trailing off

indistinctly as

Mickey continues his

anguished ramblings)

MICKEY (V.O.)

Not later, but now.  I'm so

frightened I can't move, speak, or

breathe.

DR. BROOKS

Well, you're just fine.  There's

absolutely nothing here at all.

And your tests are all fine.

(switching on the

light on the panel

and propping up the

X-rays)

I must admit, I was concerned,

given your symptoms.

(turning to look at

the offscreen Mickey)

What caused this hearing loss in

one ear, I guess we'll never really

know for sure.  But whatever it

was, it's certainly not anything

serious at all.

(nodding)

I'm very relieved.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GAIL

What do you mean you're quitting?

Why?  The news is good!  You don't

have canc--the thing.

MICKEY

Do you realize what a thread we're

all hanging by?

GAIL

(offscreen)

Mickey, you're off the hook.  You

should be celebrating.

MICKEY

(walking around to

the front of his

desk, gesturing)

Can you understand how meaningless

everything is?  Everything!  I'm

talking about nnnn--our lives, the

show...the whole world, it's

meaningless.

GAIL

(gesturing)

Yeah...but you're not dying!

MICKEY

No, I'm not dying now, but, but

(gesturing)

you know, when I ran out of the

hospital, I, I was so thrilled

because they told me I was going to

be all right.  And I'm running down

the street, and suddenly I stop,

'cause it hit me, all right, so,

you know, I'm not going to go today.

I'm okay.  I'm not going to go

tomorrow.

(pointing)

But eventually, I'm going to be in

that position.

GAIL

You're just realizing this now?

MICKEY

(offscreen)

Well, I don't realize it now, I

know it all the time, but, but I

managed to stick it in the back of

my mind...

MICKEY

...because it-it's a very horrible

thing to... think about!

GAIL

(muttering)

Yeah.  What?

MICKEY

(turning to Gail)

Can I tell you something?  Can I

tell you a secret?

GAIL

(nodding impatiently

as she walks around

the desk)

Yes, please.

MICKEY

(pointing)

A week ago, I bought a rifle.

GAIL

(sitting on the arm

of a chair near Mickey)

No.

MICKEY

(overlapping, nodding

and gesturing)

I went into a store, I bought a

rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if

they told me that I had a tumor, I

was going to kill myself.  The only

thing that mighta stopped me,

might've, is my parents would be

devastated.  I would, I woulda had

to shoot them, also, first.  And

then, I have an aunt and uncle, I

would have... You know, it would

have been a bloodbath.

GAIL

(shrugging, unwrapping

a stick of gum)

Tch, well, you know, eventually it,

it is going to happen to all of us.

MICKEY

Yes, but doesn't that ruin

everything for you?  That makes

everything...

MICKEY

(continuing)

...you know it, it just takes the

pleasure out of everything.

(gesturing, pointing)

I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna

die, the audience is gonna die, the

network's gonna-- The sponsor.

Everything!

GAIL

(chewing)

I know, I know, and your hamster.

MICKEY

(nodding emphatically)

Yes!

GAIL

(chewing and pointing

to Mickey)

Listen, kid, I think you snapped

your cap.

GAIL

(continuing, chewing loudly)

Maybe you need a few weeks in

Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a

whorehouse!  No?

MICKEY

(shaking his head,

his hand to his chest)

I can't stay on this show.  I gotta

get some answers.  Otherwise

(pausing and holding

his head)

I'm telling you, I'm going to do

something drastic.

CUT TO:

ELLIOT

(looking intensely at

Lee, his hands in his pockets)

I thought you weren't coming.

LEE

I almost didn't.

ELLIOT

(putting his hand on

her shoulder, wanting

to kiss her)

Lee... uh...

LEE

I didn't sleep all night.

ELLIOT

(taking his hand

away, gesturing to

the room)

No, no-no-no, I'm sure.

LEE

What are we doing, meeting in a

hotel room?  It's terrible, isn't it?

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

I-I couldn't think where to invite

you without taking risks.

LEE

I promised myself I wouldn't let

this happen till you were living

alone.  I was so torn when you

called.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

I've wanted to call you everyday

since I first told you how I felt.

ELLIOT

I resisted so many times.

(pausing)

Don't think badly of me.

ELLIOT

This is not an easy situation.

LEE

(whispering)

I know it isn't.

LEE

That was just perfect.  You've

ruined me for anyone else.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

I don't want anyone else ever to

have you.

LEE

(sighing)

I was so worried I wouldn't compare

with Hannah.

ELLIOT

(offscreen, laughing)

Oh, my God.

ELLIOT

You really do have those thoughts,

don't you?

LEE

(chuckling, touching

Elliot's arm)

Oh, all the time.

LEE

I know she must be a really

passionate person.

ELLIOT

(looking at their

clasped hands)

Yes, she's, she's very warm, but,

but it-it's me that wants to be

giving to you.  I-I-I want to do

things for you.  Hannah doesn't

need me as much.

(chuckling as Lee laughs)

I'm being presumptuous.  Not that

you need me.

LEE

(nodding)

I want you to take care of me...

And I love when you do things to me.

CUT TO:

FREDERICK

(offscreen)

You're late.

LEE

(opening the bathroom door)

Lucy and I kept talking, and I

didn't realize how late it had

gotten.

FREDERICK

(barely glancing up

from his paper)

You missed a very dull TV show

about Auschwitz.  More gruesome

film clips...and more puzzled

intellectuals declaring their

mystification over the systematic

murder of millions.

FREDERICK

(turning his head

slightly in Lee's

direction and gesturing)

The reason why they could never

answer the question "How could it

possibly happen?" is that it's the

wrong question.  Given what people

are, the question is

(swallowing)

"Why doesn't it happen more often?"

Of course it does, in subtler forms.

LEE

(moving her fingers

through her wet hair)

I have a little headache from this

weather.

FREDERICK

(grunting, sipping

his coffee)

It's been ages since I sat in front

of the TV... just changing channels

to find something.

FREDERICK

You see the whole culture...Nazis,

deodorant salesman,

wrestlers...beauty contests, the

talk show... Can you imagine the

level of a mind that watches

wrestling?

(gesturing)

Hmm?  But the worst are the

fundamentalist preachers...third-

rate con men, telling the poor

suckers that watch them that they

speak for Jesus...and to please

send in money.

(picking up his sandwich)

Money, money, money!  If Jesus came

back, and saw what's going on in

his name, he'd never stop throwing

up.

LEE

(impatiently, her

hands in her hair)

Oh, God, Frederick, could you

please lighten up?!  I'm really not

in the mood to hear a review of

contemporary society again.

FREDERICK

(standing up from the table)

You know, you've been very nervous

lately.

LEE

(sighing)

I can't take this anymore.

FREDERICK

(walking over to the bed)

I'm just trying to complete an

education I started on you five

years ago.

LEE

(unbuttoning her blouse)

I'm not your pupil.

(sighing, her hands

at her side)

I was, but I'm not.

FREDERICK

(sitting down on the

edge of the bed)

When you leave the nest, I just

want you to be ready to face the

real world.

LEE

(putting her hand on

Frederick's leg)

Frederick, we're going to have to

make some changes.

FREDERICK

(quickly looking at

Lee, alarmed)

Like what?

LEE

Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!

FREDERICK

(turning away, his

hands clasped in

front of him)

Oh!  Are we going to have this

conversation again?

LEE

Yes, we're going to have this

conversation again.  I...I have to

leave.  I have to move out.

FREDERICK

(shaking his clasped

hands intensely)

Why?

LEE

(sighing)

Because I have to!

FREDERICK

(emotionally)

What are you going to use for money?!

LEE

I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd

move in with my parents for a while.

FREDERICK

Tch, oh.  I always told you you

would leave me.

(looking at Lee)

But...does it have to be now?

LEE

(hugging her arm with

her other hand)

Well, maybe it'll only be temporary,

but I ha--I have to try.

FREDERICK

(taking Lee's head in

his hands and looking

at her)

Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.

(pausing)

Good God!  Have you been kissed

tonight?!

LEE

(reacting, pushing

Frederick's hands

from her face)

No.

FREDERICK

(reacting)

Oh, yes, you have!

LEE

(quickly standing up, defensively)

No.

FREDERICK

(raising his voice)

You've been with someone!

LEE

(overlapping, running

away from the bed)

Stop accusing me!

FREDERICK

(offscreen)

I'm too smart, Lee!  You can't fool

me!  You're turning all red!

LEE

Leave me alone!

FREDERICK

(angrily)

Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!

LEE

(leaning against the

refrigerator, sighing)

I'm sorry.

FREDERICK

Oh, couldn't you say something?

You have to slither around behind

my back!

LEE

(overlapping, her

voice emotionally raised)

I'm saying it now!

FREDERICK

So you met somebody else?

LEE

(sighing, nodding)

Yeah.

LEE

(walking into the bathroom)

But you, God, you knew that was

going to happen sooner or later.  I

can't live like this!

FREDERICK

(turning to face Lee

in the bathroom, his

arms crossed)

Who is it?

LEE

(frantically putting

things in her purse,

glaring at Frederick)

What's the difference?!  It's just

somebody I met!

FREDERICK

But who?  Where did you meet him?

LEE

It doesn't make a difference!  I

have to move out!

FREDERICK

You are, you are my only connection

to the world!

LEE

(gesturing emotionally)

Oh, God, that's too much

responsibility for me.  It's not

fair!  I want a less complicated

life, Frederick.  I want a husband,

maybe even a child before it's too

late.

FREDERICK

(reacting, his face

in his hand)

Jesus...Jesus!

LEE

(gesturing, moving

closer to Frederick)

Oh, God, I don't even know what I

want.

FREDERICK

(sighing heavily, reacting)

Oh...

LEE

(rubbing Frederick's

shoulder tenderly)

Tch, oh, what do you get out of me,

anyway?  I mean...

(laying her head

against his shoulder,

sighing deeply)

it's not sexual anymore.  It's

certainly not intellectual.  I

mean, you're so superior to me in

every way that--

FREDERICK

Please, don't patronize me!

FREDERICK

God!  I should have married you

years ago when you wanted to!  I

should have agreed.

LEE

(sighing)

Oh, God, don't you know it never

would have worked?

FREDERICK

I told you, one day you would leave

me...

(leaning on the counter)

for a younger man.  I--

CUT TO:

ELLIOT (V.O.)

What passion today with Lee.  She's

a volcano.  It was a totally

fulfilling experience... Just as I

dreamed it would be.

(nodding slightly as

he takes off his slippers)

That's what it was.  It was like

living out a dream...a great dream.

(taking off his bathrobe)

Now I feel very good and cozy being

here next to Hannah.  There's

something very lovely and real

about Hannah.

(tossing his bathrobe

aside and lying down

on the bed next to

Hannah, his hands

crossed over his stomach)

She gives me a very deep feeling of

being part of something.  She's a

wonderful woman...and I betrayed

her.  She came into my empty life

and changed it...and I paid her

back by banging her sister in a

hotel room.  God, I'm despicable.

What a cruel and shallow thing to

do.

(sitting up)

I have to call her now and tell her

what we did was crazy.

(anxiously)

It can't ever happen again.  I'm

not that kind of man...and I value

Hannah too much.  I love my wife.

Now I've betrayed her.  Oh, God!

HANNAH

(reading, not looking up)

Where're you going?

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a

phone number in my desk.  I forgot

to phone Mel Kaufman.

HANNAH

(still reading)

It's so late.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I

forgot.

ELLIOT

(muttering)

What if he answers?

(turning into the

doorway leading to

the living room)

I'll hang up.

(walking into the

darkened living room)

I'll tell her we can't communicate

until I terminate my marriage.

(whispering)

It's immoral.

ELLIOT

(gesturing and whispering)

Then, time will pass.  I won't

call, and she'll get the idea.  I

gotta stop this before I get in too

deep.  I'd rather hurt Lee a

little, than destroy Hannah.

ELLIOT

(whispering, rubbing

his hands)

It's one-thirty.  She...she can't

have a conversation with me...with

him around.  I'm getting hysterical.

(putting his hands on

his hips)

I'll call her first thing in the

morning.  I'll call her at six.

(pointing)

Frederick goes jogging at six,

yeah, she'll be alone.  And I'll,

I'll call her and nip it in the bud.

ELLIOT

(loudly, to the

offscreen Hannah, gasping)

I've got it!  I've got it!  I've

got it!

(picking up the

phone, into the telephone)

Hello?

(loudly, for the

offscreen Hannah's benefit)

Mel!

LEE

(into the telephone)

I would have hung up if you hadn't

answered and I promise I won't ever

do this again, but I just had to

tell you, I feel very close to you

tonight.  Very, very close.

(pausing)

Good night.

is meaningless." - Tolstoy

MICKEY (V.O.)

Millions of books written on every

conceivable subject by all these

great minds, and, and in the end,

none of 'em knows anything more

about the big questions of life

than I do.  Ss--I read Socrates.

You know, n-n-n--, this guy used to

kn-knock off little Greek boys.

What the hell's he got to teach me?

And, and Nietzsche with his, with

his Theory of Eternal Recurrence.

He said that the life we live,

we're gonna live over and over

again the exact same way for

eternity.  Great.  That means I,

uh, I'll have to sit through the

Ice Capades again.  Tch.  It's not

worth it.

MICKEY (V.O.)

And, and Freud, another great

pessimist.  Jeez, I was in analysis

for years.  Nothing happened.  My

poor analyst got so frustrated.

The guy finally put in a salad bar.

MICKEY (V.O.)

Oh!  Look at all these people

jogging...trying to stave off the

inevitable decay of the body.  Boy

and their exercise and their...

(glancing at a fat

woman jogger in a red

sweatsuit who runs by)

thing.  My God, she has to tote all

that fat around.  Maybe the poets

are right.  Maybe love is the only

answer.

MICKEY (V.O.)

Shh--Of course, I was in love with

Hannah.  That didn't work out too

well.

(sighing)

I even took her sister out.

Remember that?

MICKEY (V.O.)

Remember years ago when Hannah and

I got divorced and she fixed me up

with her sister Holly?

Oh, well, I cannot communicate with

to talk while the guy was singing.

HOLLY

I was so bored!

MICKEY

stay with those groups that look

like they're gonna stab their mother!

HOLLY

At least I'm open to new concepts!

Oh, I'll see myself home!

MICKEY (V.O.)

Yeah, it was quite an evening.

Holly with her cocaine...

She should have been wearing a gold

shovel around her neck.  Tch, she

was polymorphously insensitive, I

think.

Too bad, too... 'cause, you know, I

always had a little crush on her.

Sure!  Yeah.  When we get to the

Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks,

you haven't been yourself.  And

tonight at, tonight at dinner, you,

you were kind of curt with me.

ELLIOT

Was I?

HANNAH

Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when

I brought up the idea of having a

baby, you just, you jumped down my

throat.

ELLIOT

(shaking his head)

Well, I-I don't think it's a very

good idea.

HANNAH

Why not?

ELLIOT

Because it's the last thing in the

world we need right now.

HANNAH

Why do you say that?  Is there

something wrong?

ELLIOT

I don't know.

HANNAH

Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?

ELLIOT

But, you got four children!

HANNAH

I want one with you.

Well...I-I think we should wait

till things settle.

But what do, what do you--

what's that mean?  W-w-we've been,

we've been married for four years.

How settled can things get?

ELLIOT

(gesturing)

You know, y-you have some very set

plans on how your life should be

structured.  A-a house, uh, kids,

certain schools, a h--, a home in

Connecticut.  I-it's all

very...preconceived.

HANNAH

(shaking her head)

Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you

needed that.  When-when-when we

met, you said your life was chaos.

ELLIOT

I-I-I know, but there's got to be

some give and take.

ELLIOT

Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what

the hell I'm talking about.

HANNAH

(reacting)

Are you angry with me?

ELLIOT

No!

HANNAH

Do you feel, um...are you

disenchanted with our marriage?

ELLIOT

(pointing at Hannah)

I didn't say that.

HANNAH

Are you in love with someone else?

ELLIOT

(angrily)

My God!  Wha-what is this?  The

Gestapo?  No.

HANNAH

(turning to look at him)

Well, what?  What, wh-what are you

not telling me?

ELLIOT

(gesturing and pointing)

What kind of interrogation... Su-

supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am

disenchanted.  I am in love with

someone else.

HANNAH

Are you?

ELLIOT

(staring at Hannah

for a beat before

answering her)

No!

(gesturing)

But you keep asking these, these

awful questions.  My God, it's-it's

like you want me to say yes!

HANNAH

(gesturing)

What, you, of c-- What are you

talking about?  Of course not.  I'd

be destroyed!

ELLIOT (V.O.)

For Chrissakes, stop torturing her.

Tell her you want out and get it

over with.  You're in love with her

sister.  You didn't do it on

purpose.  Be honest.  It's always

the best way.

HANNAH

(softly)

Look, can I help you?  If you're

suffering over something, will you

share it with me?

ELLIOT

Hannah, you know how much I love

you.

(kissing her on the forehead)

I ought to have my head examined.

I don't deserve you.

CUT TO:

The audition.

CUT TO:

HOLLY

(offscreen)

You know, I just want to look so

good, but I don't want to seem, you

know, like I'm overdressed.

(onscreen, walking up

the stairs behind Hannah)

You know what I'm saying?

HANNAH

(overlapping, turning

to look at Holly)

Oh, no, not at all.

HOLLY

(holding up a dress

she's carrying on her arm)

Well, how about this?

HANNAH

(looking at the dress)

Well, I, I really like that.  I

think that's a pretty color on you.

HOLLY

(overlapping)

Oh, yeah.

(laughing)

HOLLY

(continuing, smiling)

Did you ever think you'd be helping

me buy something to wear to the

opera?

(chuckling)

HANNAH

(playfully hitting

Holly's arm)

Nuh-uh...but I think it's great.  I

can't wait to meet him.

HOLLY

He's married...

HANNAH

(interrupting,

looking through the rack)

Oh-oh.

HOLLY

(overlapping)

...and his wife's, uh, in and out

of institutions.  She's

schizophrenic.

HOLLY

Sometimes she's terrific...

HANNAH

(overlapping)

Oooo.

HOLLY

...and then she just breaks down.

(gesturing)

And he has this sweet daughter...and

when she goes to college next year,

he's going to split permanently.  I

mean...

HANNAH

(overlapping, looking

up at Holly)

Oh?

HOLLY

...he's really paid his dues,

but...then she helped put him

through architecture school, you

know, so...

HANNAH

(interrupting,

glancing at her

sister for a moment

with amazement)

You found all this, all this out on

one date?

HOLLY

(chuckling and nodding)

Well, I think he was dying to open

up.  It's so sad.

(finally looking back

and forth along the rack)

Now...what should I wear to my

audition?

HOLLY

(explaining)

I've got a singing audition for a

Broadway musical.

(chuckling)

Of course, I'll never get it.

HANNAH

Singing?

HOLLY

(chuckling)

Yeah, can you believe it?

HANNAH

(walking around the

rack to Holly, still surprised)

Really?

HOLLY

(vulnerably)

Well, I mean, why not?  You know,

wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...

HANNAH

(overlapping, shaking

her head)

Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh...

No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't,

I didn't know you sung.

HOLLY

(defensively)

Well, you think everybody in m-

musicals sings so well?

HANNAH

(gesturing, shaking

her head)

No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they

sing.

HOLLY

Well...you know, uh...I sing a

little, I mean...

(chuckling self-consciously)

HANNAH

(realizing she's hurt

Holly, reacting)

Ohh!

HOLLY

(overlapping, shaking

her head)

You know.

HANNAH

(hanging the blouse

back on the rack)

I know, no--

(chuckling)

I know.

HOLLY

(overlapping, still

chuckling self-

consciously, gesturing)

I mean, y-you know, don't say it

that way, you know, because my

confidence is not my strong point,

I--

HANNAH

(interrupting,

touching her sister's shoulder)

No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean

that.  No, I didn't mean that.

HOLLY

(gesturing)

Uh, you know, I think I can fake my

way through a song.

HANNAH

(nodding as she looks

around the store,

pulling up her

shoulder bag strap)

Uh-huh.

HOLLY

Easily.

HOLLY

(looking at Hannah)

W-why?  You don't think it's

realistic?

HANNAH

(putting her hand on

Holly's shoulder)

No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I-

I-I, no, I-I just...

(gesturing)

hate to see you put yourself in a

position where, where you get hurt,

you know.  You know, you know how

you take...

HOLLY

(overlapping, nodding)

Yeah.

HANNAH

(continuing, looking

at some clothes

hanging beneath the table)

...every, eh, single rejection as-

as-as a...a confirmation that you

have no talent, or something?

HOLLY

(overlapping, nodding)

Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it.

(chuckling and gesturing)

HANNAH

(overlapping, looking

at the clothes)

I hope.

HOLLY

(sighing)

Boy, you really know how to cut me

down.

HANNAH

(looking at Holly, reacting)

What?  You don't, don't be so

sensitive.  Can't I say anything?

HOLLY

(gesturing)

Tch, well, I sing!

(suddenly shouting)

For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me

sing!

HANNAH

(overlapping, reacting

to her sister's outburst)

Okay!

(looking at her sister)

Okay.  I-- What happened?  You

know, we were having a really nice

time, a-and suddenly, everything

went to bad feeling.

HOLLY

(shaking her head)

Nobody but you can do that to me.

I don't know why.

HANNAH

(gesturing)

Look, everything's going your way.

HOLLY

You're right.

(pausing)

I'm happy.

(shrugging, looking

at the offscreen Hannah)

Why must I let my insecurities

spoil everything?

CUT TO:

HOLLY

(offscreen, singing softly)

"This year's fancies

Are passing fancies..."

HOLLY

(continuing her

singing, barely

moving her body)

"But sighing sighs

Holding hands

This my heart

Understands

I'm old-fashioned

And I don't mind it

It's how I want to be

As long as you agree

To stay old-fashioned with me."

PRODUCER

(offscreen)

Thank you.

DIRECTOR

(offscreen)

Thank you.

PRODUCER

(offscreen)

It was very nice.

ASSISTANT #1

(offscreen, overlapping)

Terrific.

STAGE MANAGER

(offscreen,

overlapping the

executives' chatter)

April Knox?

APRIL

(singing)

"Someday

When I'm awfully low

When the world is cold

I will get a glow

Just thinking of you

And the way you look

Tonight..."

CUT TO:

HOLLY

I'm telling you, you sounded great.

You, uh, you may be surprised.

APRIL

(sighing)

Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering

job this week.  I'm real low on

money.

HOLLY

Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's

eightieth birthday party on

Riverside Drive...or Riverside

Memorial Chapel, depending on his

health.

APRIL

Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.

HOLLY

(reacting)

What?

APRIL

(gesturing)

Uh, David called me last night, and

he wants to take me to the opera.

(chuckling)

I didn't know what to say.

HOLLY

(reacting)

You're joking.

APRIL

No, he called late last night.

HOLLY

(sadly)

I, uh, I'm very surprised.

APRIL

(chuckling, gesturing)

He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.

HOLLY

(looking briefly at April)

And you, you-you're going?

APRIL

Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say.

First I said no, but then, he

pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd

taken you once and he really wanted

to invite me.

HOLLY

(pausing)

But I'm seeing him.

APRIL

(gesturing)

I know.  I said that, but...

(shrugging)

he said it was something he really

felt like doing.

HOLLY

(stopping and facing April)

Gee, um...

(looking off, sniffing)

I...I don't know what to say.

APRIL

Look, it's just an evening at the

opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in

accepting?

APRIL

(continuing)

Huh?

CUT TO:

The big leap.

FATHER FLYNN

(gesturing)

Now why do you think that you would

like to convert to Catholicism?

MICKEY

Well, uh, because, y-you know, I

gotta have something to believe in,

otherwise life is just meaningless.

FATHER FLYNN

(pacing behind his

desk and gesturing)

I understand.  But why did you make

the decision to choose the Catholic

faith?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

Tch.  Well, y-you know...first of

all, because it's a very beautiful

religion.  It's very well structured.

Now I'm talking now, incidentally,

about the-the, uh, against-school-

prayer, pro-abortion, anti-nuclear

wing.

FATHER FLYNN

(offscreen)

So at the moment you don't believe

in God.

MICKEY

(offscreen)

No.  A-a-and I-I want to.  You

know, I'm-I'm willing to do anything.

I'll, you know, I'll dye Easter

eggs if it works.

(walking over to

Father Flynn and

sitting down in an

adjacent chair)

I-I need some evidence.  I gotta

have some proof.  Uh, you know, i-

i-if I can't believe in God

(gesturing, his

raincoat in his lap)

then I don't think life is worth

living.

FATHER FLYNN

(stopping his tea pouring)

It means making a very big leap.

MICKEY

(nodding, fiddling

with his raincoat)

Yes, well, can-can you help me?

MOTHER

(crying)

Why?  Oh, my God!

MICKEY

(overlapping and gesturing)

I don't understand.

(turning to his

offscreen father)

I thought that you would be happy.

FATHER

(offscreen)

How can we be happy?

MICKEY

(following his father)

Well, because I never thought of

God in my life.  Now I'm giving it

serious thought.

FATHER

(offscreen, in the kitchen)

But Catholicism?  Why not your own

people?

MICKEY

(gesturing at the

kitchen door to his

offscreen father)

Because I got off to a wrong foot

with my own thing, you know.  B-b-

b-but I need a dramatic change in

my life.

FATHER

(offscreen)

You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

I know it sounds funny, but I'm

gonna try.

FATHER

(offscreen)

But why?  We raised you as a Jew.

MICKEY

(shrugging)

So, just 'cause I was born that

way... You know, I'm old enough to

make a mature decision.

FATHER

But why Jesus Christ?  Why, for

instance, shouldn't you become a

Buddhist?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

A Bud--?  That's totally alien to

me.  Look, you're getting on in

years, right?  Aren't you afraid of

dying?

FATHER

(offscreen)

Why should I be afraid?

MICKEY

(loudly gesturing)

Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!

FATHER

(offscreen)

So?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

That thought doesn't terrify you?

FATHER

(waving his arm)

Who thinks about such nonsense?

Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll

be dead.

MICKEY

(following his

father, gesturing)

I don't understand.  Aren't you

frightened?

FATHER

(offscreen)

Of what?  I'll be unconscious.

MICKEY

(turning and walking

down the hallway)

Yeah, I know.  But never to exist

again!

FATHER

(offscreen)

How do you know?

MICKEY

Well, it certainly doesn't look

promising.

FATHER

(offscreen)

Who knows what'll be?

FATHER

(gesturing with his

hands full)

I'll either be unconscious or I

won't.  If not, I'll deal with it

then.  I'm not gonna worry now

about what's gonna be when I'm

unconscious.

MICKEY

(pounding on the door)

Mom, come out!

MOTHER

(offscreen in the bathroom)

Of course there's a God, you idiot!

You don't believe in God?

MICKEY

(sighing)

But if there's a God, then wh-why

is there so much evil in the world?

(shrugging)

What-- Just on a simplistic level.

Why-why were there Nazis?

MOTHER

(offscreen in the bathroom)

Tell him, Max.

FATHER

(offscreen)

How the hell do I know why there

were Nazis?  I don't know how the

can opener works.

CUT TO:

LEE

(overlapping Hannah's gasp)

Hi.

HANNAH

Hi.  Where's Holly?

LEE

(overlapping)

Hi.  She's auditioning for a

television commercial.  She said

she's gonna be a little late.

HANNAH

(sighing)

Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?

LEE

(following Hannah

through the

restaurant's doors)

Oh, God, you know Holly.  When

she's depressed, she's manic.  I

think it was a good idea that we

invited her to lunch.

HANNAH

(pulling off her

scarf, still on the

subject of Holly)

I hope you tell her it was your

idea...

LEE

Why?

HANNAH

(overlapping)

...'cause every time I try to be

helpful, you know, sh-she gets so

defensive.

LEE

(unbuttoning her coat)

Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just

embarrassed in front of you, that's

all.

HANNAH

(offscreen)

So how are you?

LEE

Oh, me, I'm okay.

HANNAH

(offscreen)

Do you miss Frederick?

LEE

No.

HANNAH

(offscreen)

I can't believe Elliot and I can't

think of someone nice for you to go

out with, you know--

LEE

(interrupting, her

voice slightly

higher-pitched as she

takes off her coat)

How are you?

HANNAH

(offscreen)

I'm okay.

LEE

(overlapping)

You know, how's everything?  You

doing okay?  How's Frederick?

(laughing)

I mean, Elliot.

HANNAH

(offscreen, overlapping)

Y-yeah.

HANNAH

(continuing)

Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess

he's fine.  I don't know.

(shaking her head,

her arms crossed)

He's been kinda moody lately, the

last few months.

LEE

(offscreen, overlapping)

Really?

HANNAH

Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong

with him.  He's just...kind of

distant and difficult.

LEE

(offscreen)

Oh...

HANNAH

(overlapping, gesturing)

I've been trying to talk to him

about it.  He says everything's

fine, but I don't know.

Automatically, you know, I leap to

the worst conclusions.

LEE

(offscreen)

Like what?

HANNAH

(gesturing)

I mean, I don't know, he's seeing

someone else or something, but...

LEE

(walking back onscreen

without her coat, reacting)

Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks

things like that.

HANNAH

(turning, to Holly)

Hey, hi!

HOLLY

(overlapping)

Well, I just came from an audition...

LEE

(overlapping, leaning

against the coatcheck wall)

Hi.

HOLLY

(continuing)

...which I did not get.

HANNAH

(reacting)

Awwww...

HOLLY

(overlapping, sighing)

So what's new?

HANNAH

(helping Holly with

her coat)

Boy--

HOLLY

(interrupting)

They said I was too offbeat looking,

whatever the hell that means.

HANNAH

Oh, what do they know?

HOLLY

(to the checker)

Thanks.

(turning to her sisters)

But guess who was there auditioning?

LEE

April?

HANNAH

(reacting to Holly's news)

Oh, gosh.

HOLLY

You got it.

HOLLY

(gesturing)

I was very polite.  I maintained my

poise.

(taking out a match

for her cigarette)

I said hello.

LEE

Hmm.  I never trusted April, you

know.  She has eyes in the back of

her head.

HOLLY

Yeah, well, she and an architect

are now a very definite item, which

I still cannot believe.

LEE

(overlapping)

Hmm.

HANNAH

Oh, God...

HOLLY

(nodding her head,

holding her cigarette)

Yeah, although it's put an end to

the Stanislavski Catering Company.

Which is why I have to speak to you.

And...

(gesturing to Hannah)

you're gonna get impatient, but...I

have to borrow some more money.

(putting her cigarette

in her mouth and

picking up the matches)

HANNAH

(shaking her head)

Well, that...th-that's fine.

HOLLY

(gesturing, her

cigarette in one

hand, her matches in

the other)

But what I decided to do is some

writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it

with acting.  You know, these

meaningless auditions at cattle

calls.  And I can't handle another

rejection.

(emotionally)

Now let's face it here.  I gotta,

you know, latch on to something in

my life.  You know--something with

a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.

(lighting her cigarette)

It's just...crazy!

(puffing her cigarette)

I've got...an idea for a story.

More than one.  And I just need a

few months, you know, or, uh, a

year even.

HOLLY

I've picked up a lot about dramatic

structure from doing my scenes in

acting class.

HANNAH

(offscreen)

Well, that-that's good.  It just,

uh...it just seems to me that-that

six months or a year, if-if you

spent it more productively...

HOLLY

(offscreen, the

camera still focused

on Lee)

Well-well, like what?

HANNAH

Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh,

um... Didn't Mom mention there was

something...something at the Museum

of Broadcasting?

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Yeah, that's clerical.

HANNAH

No.  She, didn't she say it was,

um...she said it was in the

publicity department.  That-that

can lead to other things.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.

HANNAH

(offscreen)

I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to

be helpful.  A person doesn't just

say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm

finished as an actress.  Now I'm a

writer."  I mean--

HOLLY

(offscreen, interrupting)

Yeah, you mean not at my age.

LEE

(shaking her head,

unable to take much more)

Oh, please!  We all came to have

lunch, didn't we?

HOLLY

(reacting, now in view)

Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.

(puffing on her cigarette)

What's to eat?

LEE

(trying to alleviate

the tension)

Boy...Holly...Holly.

HOLLY

(overlapping)

I just want a salad.

(to Hannah)

You really think I'm a loser, don't

you?

HANNAH

(offscreen)

What do--?  You're being ridiculous.

LEE

(overlapping, reacting)

You are, Holly.  Stop it.

HOLLY

(to Hannah)

You treat me like a loser.

HANNAH

(offscreen)

How?

HOLLY

You never have any faith in my

plans.  You always undercut my

enthusiasm.

HANNAH

Not so!  No.  I think I've been

very supportive.  I've...I try to

give you honest, constructive advice.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Hmm!

HANNAH

(overlapping)

I'm-I'm always happy to help you

financially.  I think I've gone out

of my way to-to introduce you to

interesting single men.  There's

nothing I would--

HOLLY

(offscreen, interrupting)

Uh, losers!  All losers!

HANNAH

You're too demanding.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

You know, I could always tell what

you thought of me by the type of

men you fixed me up with!

HANNAH

(offscreen)

You're crazy!  That's not true.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.

LEE

(interrupting angrily,

looking as if she's

about to cry)

Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!

HANNAH

(offscreen, overlapping)

Oh, now--

(stuttering)

LEE

(interrupting,

shaking her head)

She's going through a really rough

time right now.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Why are you so upset?

LEE

(sobbing and gesturing)

You know, you've been picking on

her ever since she came in here.

Now just leave her alone for a

while!  I'm just suffocating.

(sniffing back her tears)

HOLLY

(leaning over to Lee,

puzzled, reacting to

her sister's tears)

What's the matter with you, Lee?

Why are you so sensitive all of a

sudden?

HANNAH

(offscreen)

Look.

(onscreen, as the

camera circles around

the table)

Listen.  Listen.

(tapping Holly on her

shoulder and gesturing)

You want to write?  Write.

HOLLY

(offscreen,

overlapping to Lee)

What's the matter?

HANNAH

(flinging her hands)

Write!  Let's just not talk about

it anymore.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Good.

HANNAH

(shaking her head)

Take...take a year.  Take six

months.  Whatever you want.  Who

knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll

be sitting with a good play.

HANNAH

(to Lee)

What's the matter?  What's the

matter with you?

(offscreen again as

the camera circles

back to Lee)

You look pale.  You okay?

LEE

(overlapping, nodding

and stuttering)

I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you

know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy

all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have

a headache.

HANNAH

(offscreen, overlapping)

Yeah?

LEE

(still rubbing her

forehead, looking

down at the menu)

I think we need to eat.

CUT TO:

Summer in New York.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

I-I can't seem to take action.

I'm-I'm like, uh, Hamlet unable to

kill his uncle.

ELLIOT

(face offscreen)

I want Lee, but I can't harm Hannah.

And in no other area am I a

procrastinator.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

Meanwhile...Lee has no direction.

She's taking courses at

Columbia...but just randomly.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

I try not to call her, but then she

calls me and then...I call and...we

try to resist meeting, but...once

in a while we meet.  Sometimes we

argue because I can't break up my

marriage.  Sometimes we wind up

making love and...we both feel

terrible.

ELLIOT

But it's my fault.

ELLIOT

(face offscreen)

For all my education,

accomplishments, and so-called

wisdom...I can't fathom my own heart.

CUT TO:

KRISHNA LEADER

What makes you interested in

becoming a Hare Krishna?

MICKEY

(gesturing, walking onscreen)

Well, I'm not saying that I want to

join or anything, but...but I know

you guys believe in reincarnation,

you know, so it interests me.

KRISHNA LEADER

Yeah, well, what's your religion?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

Well, I was born Jewish, you know,

but, uh, but last winter I tried to

become a Catholic and...it didn't

work for me.  I-I studied and I

tried and I gave it everything,

but, you know, Catholicism for me

was die now, pay later, you know.

And I just couldn't get with it.

And I, and I wanted to, you know.

I--

KRISHNA LEADER

(interrupting)

You're afraid of dying?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you?

I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation,

does that mean my soul would pass

to another human being, or would I

come back as a moose or an aardvark

or something?

KRISHNA LEADER

(handing some Krishna

literature over the

fence to Mickey)

Take our literature...

MICKEY

(nodding, taking the material)

Uh-huh.

KRISHNA LEADER

...read it over, and think about it.

MICKEY

(looking down at the

material he's just received)

Well, okay.  Thank you very much.

KRISHNA LEADER

You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.

MICKEY (V.O.)

Who are you kidding?  You're gonna

be a Krishna?  You're gonna shave

your head and put on robes and

dance around at airports?  You'll

look like Jerry Lewis.  Oh, God,

I'm so depressed.

Autumn chill.

LEE (V.O.)

The nights are really getting

cooler.  Summer went so quickly.

Soon it'll be fall.

(walking to the beach

and sitting down)

My literature professor really

likes me.  It was fun being out

with him last night.

(staring pensively at

the water)

Funny.  I feel like I'm betraying

Elliot...but that's ridiculous.

Why shouldn't I see Doug?  Elliot's

not free.

(pausing)

Just go one step at a time.  Let's

see what the next few months bring.

HOLLY

(into the telephone)

Hannah?  Hi.  Listen, um, you'll be

happy to know that your money has

not gone completely to waste... No,

I have an actual first rough draft

of something I wrote... Yeah.  Yeah.

Yeah, well, I showed it to Lee, and

she gave me some good pointers.

And, um, listen, I'm pretty near

where you live.  I wonder if I

could just drop it off...and, you

know, when you have time, some

time, read it, an-and we'll talk

when I come over at Thanksgiving.

Okay?  All right.  Okay.  Oh, wait,

wait.

(turning her body,

still on the phone)

Listen.  Listen.  I think Lee met

an interesting guy at Columbia...

Yeah.  Yeah, well, he sounds really

nice...

(puffing on her cigarette)

Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Well,

we'll talk at Thanksgiving.  Bye-bye.

EVAN

(gesturing)

Now, here...here's a song that

Norma sang on that trip we made up

to the show in Buffalo.  And, oh,

was she beautiful that night!

NORMA

Come on.

(laughing and touching

Evan's shoulder)

EVAN

(overlapping, to the woman)

Thank you, honey.

(putting his drink

down on the piano)

Oh, yes, you were, dear.  Don't you

remember that night?

(gesturing and

pushing back some

sheet music that was

starting to fall)

She was so beautiful...she was so

beautiful that when men saw her

walking along the streets, they'd

drive their cars right up on the

sidewalk.

EVAN

(looking back at Norma)

Isn't that right, honey, eh?

NORMA

(tapping his shoulder)

A slight exaggeration.

EVAN

(overlapping Norma, laughing)

I know.

NORMA

(gesturing)

But only slight.

ELLIOT

(sipping his drink)

You've been very cold to me tonight.

LEE

(glancing back at

Elliot, then turning away)

No.

ELLIOT

Is something wrong?

LEE

(turning)

Oh, not here.

(touching Elliot's arm)

There are too many people around.

CUT TO:

HOLLY

(looking offscreen)

Hey, Hannah?  You know, I think Lee

is really serious about her new

boyfriend.  Yeah, eh, from what I

understand he sounds really nice.

HOLLY

I'm so happy for her.  I think

she's in love.

HOLLY

(reacting)

Hey, what's the matter?

HANNAH

(taking a bunch of

celery out and

slamming the

refrigerator door)

I'm real upset about what you wrote.

HOLLY

My script?

HANNAH

It's obviously based on Elliot and

me.

HOLLY

Oh, so loosely.

HANNAH

(angrily)

No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real

specifically!  Is that how you see

us?

HOLLY

(shrugging, walking

out of the pantry area)

Well--

HANNAH

(interrupting)

Can I, can I not accept gestures

and feelings from people?  Do I, do

I put people off?

HOLLY

(reacting)

Well, it's a made-up story.

HANNAH

(yelling)

No, it's real exact!  The-the

situations, the dialogue, everything.

It's-it's full of intimate details

between Elliot and me!

Which I don't, I don't see how you

could even possibly know about.  A

conversation we once had about

adoption?

HOLLY

(gesturing, the towel

still in her hand, as

she speaks to her

offscreen sister)

Well, Lee mentioned that to me, so

obviously you discussed it with her.

You...

(pacing around the table)

I just took the essence and I blew

it up into drama.

HANNAH

I don't see how Lee could know

about these things.  I don't!  I

don't tell her everything.

HOLLY

(reacting)

Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.

HANNAH

(turning to look at Holly)

You make it sound like, you know, I

have no needs or something.  You

think I'm too self-sufficient?

HOLLY

(stopping her mindless

straightening at the

table, reacting)

Now, Hannah, that's not what I

meant, you know.

(walking offscreen to

the sink area)

Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you

for so much. "You're so giving.

It's not a criticism.  We love you.

We're grateful."

HANNAH

(walking out of the

pantry to the food-

laden table)

You're grateful, but you resent me.

HOLLY

(offscreen)

Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this

conversation.  I didn't do anything

wrong.

HOLLY

(onscreen)

Y-you mentioned to me yourself that

you and Elliot were having some

problems.

HANNAH

(gesturing)

Yeah, we're having some problems,

but problems that are my

business...which I don't see how

you could know about in such detail.

How does Lee know about these

things?  How?  They're private!

HOLLY

(turning to look at

her sister as she

walks past)

Well, why don't you share them with

us?

HANNAH

(with her back to the camera)

I don't...I don't want to bother

everyone.

HOLLY

(facing her sister's back)

That's the point.  I'd like to be

bothered.

HANNAH

(turning to look at Holly)

I don't see how you could know

about these things unless Elliot's

been talking to you.

HOLLY

(shaking her head)

No, he hasn't.  If I offended you,

I'm sorry.

LEE

(offscreen)

It's over, Elliot.  I don't know

how to make it any clearer.  It's

over.  I can't see you anymore.

ELLIOT

(offscreen, overlapping)

Uh...

(onscreen, gesturing)

I-I-I know.  I deserve this.

LEE

(touching her chest)

Look, I'm just as much at fault.

ELLIOT

(overlapping, gesturing)

If-if-if you can believe I have

such feelings for you!

LEE

I've got to be honest with you.  I

met someone else.  I've met someone

else.

(turning and walking

away from Elliot)

I...I told you I wasn't going to

wait forever.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

But it hasn't been forever.

(walking over to Lee

at the just-closed door)

LEE

(gesturing)

It's been nearly a year since our

first time and you're still married

to my sister, which...I now realize

is fine because you're probably

much more in love with her than you

know.

ELLIOT

(shaking his head)

Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.

LEE

(overlapping, gesturing)

Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An-

an-and in a way you led me on,

because I truly believed you were

unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I

would never have let myself be

drawn in.  I was very weak.  So

were you.  Now I've met someone else.

LEE

(to Mavis)

Dinner soon?

MAVIS

About fifteen minutes.

LEE

(nodding)

Uh-huh.  Good.

ELLIOT

And you're in love overnight?

LEE

I care a great deal about him, yes.

ELLIOT

(trying to put his

arm around Lee)

Lee...

LEE

(pulling back,

flinging her hands)

Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it.

It's over!

NORMA

(holding the door,

half in and half out

of the kitchen)

Sweetheart, I loved your script.  I

thought it was so clever.

HOLLY

(turning to Norma,

smiling, and holding

a glass of wine)

Well, you're my mother.  Not

everybody's gonna be such a sucker.

NORMA

(gesturing)

I particularly liked the character

of the mother.  Just a boozy old

flirt with a filthy mouth.

NORMA

I'm so proud!

HOLLY

Oh, Mom, thanks.

UNCLE

(raising his bottle

of beer to the children)

Now here's a toast to Thanksgiving,

all right?

UNCLE

Are we supposed to have beer?

Yeeeah!

UNCLE

(overlapping the

children's squeals of delight)

Let me at it!

(to one of the little boys)

How's that, Fletcher?

UNCLE

(to the little girl)

Doll?  To Thanksgiving.  Here's a

little toast, doll.

(clinking glasses)

Come on.  Bottoms up.

HANNAH

(to the offscreen Elliot)

Have you been talking to Holly or

Lee about us?  About our-our

personal life?

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

Me?  Of course not.

HANNAH

There's things Holly wrote about in

her script about us that are

so...personal they could only have

come from you.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

Look, I've got a splitting headache

and I don't like being accused.

HANNAH

(gesturing)

I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do

you...do you find me too...too

giving?

(closing the door of

the bathroom slightly

so only she is seen

on the screen)

Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I

don't know, disgustingly perfect or

something?

ELLIOT

No.

HANNAH

(following Elliot and

gesturing, talking to

his back)

Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh,

what's come between us?  How have I

alienated you?

ELLIOT

(taking a bottle of

aspirin from the

cabinet and walking

back to the sink, gesturing)

Hannah, my head is throbbing.

HANNAH

(gesturing)

You never want to talk about it.

I-- Every time I bring it up, you-

you change the subject.  What is it?

Do you-- We're communicating less

and less.  You sleep with me less

and less.

ELLIOT

(angrily turning to

Hannah and pointing

as she shouts)

Hannah, I am very mixed up!  Now

please!

HANNAH

(reacting, her voice

trembling slightly,

and gesturing)

Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind

my back?  Do you?  You must.  They-

they seem to know so much about us.

ELLIOT

(walking towards a

towel rack and gesturing)

Well, maybe I've asked advice once

or twice or-or made a joke.

HANNAH

(gesturing)

Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you

talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do

you, do you, do you phone them?

ELLIOT

(whirling around to

face Hannah, snapping)

Leave me alone, can you?!

ELLIOT

(continuing in a

lower tone)

Jesus, I've told you.  I need

someone I can matter to.

HANNAH

(reacting, near tears)

You matter to me.  Completely.

ELLIOT

(pausing, his voice

rising again)

It's hard to be around someone who

gives so much and-and needs so

little in return!

HANNAH

(gesturing, pleading)

But, look...I-I have enormous needs.

ELLIOT

(shouting)

Well, I can't see them, and neither

can Lee or Holly!

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

HANNAH

(offscreen)

It's so pitch-black tonight.  I

feel lost.

ELLIOT

(offscreen)

You're not lost.

ELLIOT

I love you so much.

CUT TO:

Lucky I ran into you.

MICKEY

(gesturing)

Mmm, I don't know if you remember

me, but we had the worst night of

my life together.

HOLLY

(laughing, holding

some records)

I remember you.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

Yes, you do recall, right?

HOLLY

(overlapping, smiling

and nodding)

I recall you.

MICKEY

(gesturing)

I was walking past and I saw you in

here...

HOLLY

(overlapping, nodding)

Yeah.

MICKEY

...and I thought I'd come in

and...and we could replay, uh, the

whole, uh...

HOLLY

(interrupting,

laughing and shaking

her head)

We didn't hit it off.

MICKEY

(overlapping, smiling)

Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We

did everything but exchange gunshots.

HOLLY

How are you?

MICKEY

Good.  How are you?

HOLLY

I'm fine.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

You look wonderful.

HOLLY

(chuckling, shaking

her head)

Oh, no.

MICKEY

(overlapping,

scratching his head)

Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.

HOLLY

Yeah?

MICKEY

It was a terrible evening.

HOLLY

Yeah, it was.

MICKEY

(overlapping, gesturing)

Remember slamming the cab door in

my face and..

(touching his nose as

Holly laughs)

you know, it came very dangerously

close to emasculating my nose in

a...

(touching his nose again)

HOLLY

(overlapping, laughing)

I'd never do that.

MICKEY

(continuing)

...in a really horrible way.

HOLLY

(smiling, glancing

away for a moment)

Oh, well, that was a long time ago.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

You look wonderful.  You do.  What

happened to you?

HOLLY

(shrugging)

People change...you know.

MICKEY

(touching Holly's shoulder)

Well, I hope you've changed.

HOLLY

Yeah, I hope you have, too.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

I hope so for your sake, because,

uh, your personality left something

to be desired...

HOLLY

(overlapping, shaking

her head)

Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure

you've changed.

MICKEY

(continuing)

...namely a personality.

MICKEY

So how are you?

HOLLY

(smiling)

I'm okay.

MICKEY

You didn't answer my question.

What are you doing?

HOLLY

Oh, nothing much.  You know...

MICKEY

(interrupting)

Well...

HOLLY

(overlapping)

...just some stuff.  A little of

this, a little of that, that's all.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing

question?  Should I have not asked

it?

HOLLY

(laughing)

Probably not.

MICKEY

Are you, are you out of work or

something?

HOLLY

No, well...I've been trying to write.

MICKEY

Have you?

HOLLY

(picking up a record

and looking at it)

Yeah.

MICKEY

Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what

kind of stuff?

HOLLY

(touching her chin

for a moment)

Oh...well, you-you're not interested

in this.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

No, you can tell me.

HOLLY

Come on.

MICKEY

No, I am.  I am.

HOLLY

(overlapping)

Oh, no, millions of people come up

to you and say, "Hey, I have

something I just wrote," right?

MICKEY

Nobody ever said it.

HOLLY

Really?

MICKEY

(overlapping)

This is it.  Yeah.  This is really--

HOLLY

(interrupting,

turning from the

record bins to look

at Mickey)

Well, wo-would you be willing to-to

read it?  Something...that I wrote?

MICKEY

(nodding his head)

Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it

would mean anything to you.  I

don't know why it would.

HOLLY

(laughing, touching

her face)

No, the reason I ask is--

MICKEY

(overlapping)

You've always hated my taste in the

past.

HOLLY

(pulling her jacket

off her shoulders)

No, I haven't.

MICKEY

You have.

HOLLY

(gesturing, looking

at Mickey)

I haven't.  No, the reason why I

ask is I think it might make a

great, uh, television script, and,

you know, you're so active in

television, so--

MICKEY

(chuckling, gesturing)

I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I

haven't been in television for a

year.

HOLLY

You're kidding me.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

I've done no television whatsoever.

No.

MICKEY

(offscreen, continuing)

I may, I may have to get back into

it, 'cause my accountant says that

I'm running out of dollars.

But...but, um, no, I haven't, I

just sort of dropped out for a

year...

HOLLY

(overlapping, nodding)

Oh.  Oh.

MICKEY

(offscreen, overlapping)

...which is a long, dull story and

I won't get into it.  But--

HOLLY

(interrupting)

You're okay, though, huh?

MICKEY

I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm

fine.  How are you?

HOLLY

(face offscreen,

obscured by the sign)

Oh, I'm fine.

MICKEY

What...what about your script?

(face offscreen

obscured by the sign)

So what's it about?

HOLLY

(face offscreen)

Well, I'd love it if you'd read it,

actually, 'cause I really would

value your opinion.

MICKEY

(face offscreen)

You have to remember, we-we-we

didn't agree on one thing.

HOLLY

(smiling, gesturing)

But you have to remember while

you're reading and you're cursing

my name, you know, that this is my

first script.  Well, it's not my

first script.

MICKEY

Hmm.

HOLLY

(touching her face)

Actually, my first script was about

Hannah and her husband, but, uh...

MICKEY

Yeah.

HOLLY

...Hannah read it, she got really

angry, and... you know, then I felt

badly, so I--

MICKEY

(overlapping)

Oh, well, God, I can imagine what

you wrote.

HOLLY

Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad.

But she just... you know.  I don't

know.

MICKEY

Really?

HOLLY

So, uh...I threw it out, but I have

this other one.

MICKEY

Well, you know, I-I-I...you know,

if you want me to, I'll read it.

HOLLY

(overlapping, gesturing)

Oh, gosh, I don't know.

(pausing)

Well, could I come over tomorrow

and read it to you?

MICKEY

(chuckling)

Come over tomorrow and read it to me?

MICKEY

You must be joking.  I've been

doing all my own reading since I

was forty...you know.

HOLLY

(laughing, looking at Mickey)

Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into

you.

(laughing)

Maybe.

MICKEY

(laughing)

Well, what about me?

HOLLY

(chuckling, waving

her arm)

Oh, well.

MICKEY

(overlapping, gesturing)

I should have kept going.  I-I have

a sneaking feeling, a nagging

sensation I should've kept walking

and...

MICKEY

(continuing, looking

at Holly)

...and not begun this conversation.

HOLLY

(offscreen, as the

camera moves across

the room towards her

and Mickey, reading)

"We all go through life playing the

hand we're dealt.  Craig: And what

hand were you dealt?

(onscreen now)

"Emily: I'm two high pair, maybe

even aces up.  The problem is,

you've got three deuces."

HOLLY

That's the end.

HOLLY

No, you can tell me straight.  It's

okay.  Just, you know, tell me what

you think.

MICKEY

(shaking his head, shrugging)

It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm,

tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was

not in the mood to listen to this

thing now.

(sighing)

I don't know what to say.  I'm

moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I,

you know, I was on the edge of my

seat.  I just think it's wonderful!

I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This

is not an insult.  I'm amazed that

you can...

(sighing)

It was-- I just thought it was great.

HOLLY

(reacting)

Really?

MICKEY

(grunting and gesturing)

Yes!  I was abso-- And...w-

what...made you think of that

climax scene where the, where the...

architect is walking home with his

actress girlfriend and-and the ex-

wife who's schizophrenic jumps out

of the bushes and stabs him to death?

HOLLY

(laughing and nodding)

Oh, it just came to me one day.

MICKEY

(gesturing)

Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm,

I, you know...

HOLLY

(gasping, hitting her

forehead with her hand)

Oh, gosh, you really think I can

write?

MICKEY

(gesturing)

I thought it was wonder-- There's

maybe one or two things in there

that I would do differently myself,

but...

HOLLY

(gasping and nodding)

Right.

MICKEY

(continuing)

...but who cares?  It was just--

(gesturing)

It was fabulous.

HOLLY

(chuckling)

Oh!

MICKEY

(smiling and shaking

his head)

Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so

impressed.

HOLLY

(laughing)

Oh, God!

MICKEY

(offscreen, overlapping)

I am.  You-you made my day.

HOLLY

(gasping)

Oh, wow!

MICKEY

(offscreen)

It was just great.  Uh, I was all

set...I was set to be bored stiff.

HOLLY

(grinning, looking at

the offscreen Mickey)

Uh, gee.  Would you like to have

lunch?  Uh, uh...

MICKEY

(offscreen)

I-I would love to talk to you

about, uh, that script.  I-I, you

know, I think maybe that we could

do something with it.

HOLLY

(nodding)

Okay, and listen, I would like to

hear what made you suddenly decide

to drop out of life.

MICKEY

(offscreen)

Oh, who cares?

HOLLY

(gesturing)

Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I

care.  You used to be so ambitious

and...

(pausing, grinning)

God, you really liked it?!

HOLLY

(gesturing)

Gosh, you really went through a

crisis, you know that?  H-how did

you get over it?  I mean, when I

ran into you, you seemed, you

seemed just perfectly fine.  Well,

you seem fine now.

MICKEY

Well...

(chuckling)

I'll tell you.

(sighing)

One day about a month ago...

MICKEY (V.O.)

...I really hit bottom.  You know,

I just felt that in a Godless

universe, I didn't want to go on

living.  Now I happen to own this

rifle...

(coughing)

MICKEY (V.O.)

...which I loaded, believe it or

not, and pressed it to my forehead.

And I remember thinking, at the

time, I'm gonna kill myself.  Then

I thought...what if I'm wrong?

What if there is a God?  I mean,

after all, nobody really knows that.

MICKEY (V.O.)

But then I thought, no.  You know,

maybe is not good enough.  I want

certainty or nothing.  And I

remember very clearly the clock was

ticking, and I was sitting there

frozen, with the gun to my head,

debating whether to shoot.

MICKEY (V.O.)

All of a sudden, the gun went off.

MICKEY (V.O.)

I had been so tense, my finger had

squeezed the trigger inadvertently...

NEIGHBOR #1

(offscreen, overlapping)

What's happening?  Wh-wh-what's

going on?

MICKEY (V.O.)

(continuing)

...but I was perspiring so much,

the gun had slid off my forehead

and missed me.

NEIGHBOR #2

(offscreen, overlapping)

I don't know.  I heard a gun.  Is

everything all right?

MICKEY (V.O.)

And suddenly, neighbors were, were,

pounding on the door, and-and I

don't know, the whole scene was

just pandemonium.  And, uh, you

know, and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door.

MICKEY (V.O.)

I-I-I-I didn't know what to say.

You know, I was, I was embarrassed

and confused, and my-my-my mind was

r-r-racing a mile a minute...

MICKEY (V.O.)

...and I-I jus knew one thing.

MICKEY (V.O.)

I...I-I-I-I had to get out of that

house.  I had to just get out in

the fresh air and-and clear my head.

And I remember very clearly.  I

walked the streets.  I walked and I

walked.  I-I didn't know what was

going through my mind.  It all

seemed so violent and un-unreal to

me.  And I wandered...

MICKEY (V.O.)

...for a long time on the Upper

West Side, you know, an-and it must

have been hours!  You know, my, my

feet hurt.  My head was, was

pounding, and, and I had to sit

down.  I went into a movie house.

I-I didn't know what was playing or

anything.

MICKEY (V.O.)

I just, I just needed a moment to

gather my thoughts and, and be

logical, and, and put the world

back into rational perspective.

MICKEY (V.O.)

And I went upstairs to the balcony,

and I sat down

(sighing)

and, you know, the movie was a-a-a

film that I'd seen many times in my

life since I was a kid, an-and I

always u-uh, loved it.  And, you

know, I'm, I'm watching these

people up on the screen, and I

started getting hooked o-on the

film, you know?

MICKEY (V.O.)

...And I started to feel how can

you even think of killing yourself?

I mean, isn't it so stupid?  I

mean, l-look at all the people up

there on the screen.  You know,

they're real funny, and, and what

if the worst is true?

MICKEY (V.O.)

What if there's no God, and you

only go around once and that's it?

Well, you know, don't you want to

be part of the experience?  You

know, what the hell, it-i-it's not

all a drag.  And I'm thinking to

myself, geez, I should stop ruining

my life...

MICKEY (V.O.)

...searching for answers I'm never

gonna get, and just enjoy it while

it lasts.  And...you know...

MICKEY (V.O.)

...after, who knows?  I mean, you

know, maybe there is something.

Nobody really knows.  I know, I

know "maybe" is a very slim reed to

hang your whole life on, but that's

the best we have.  And...then, I

started to sit back, and I actually

began to enjoy myself.

They'll be coming around the

mountain..."

HOLLY

(gesturing)

Um...look, there's something I've,

uh, that's been bothering me for a

long time, and I just thought I'd

just tell you what it was and just

sort of clear the deck here, and

(chuckling)

that's this.

MICKEY

(mumbling)

Oh, yeah?  What?

HOLLY

(overlapping)

That I've always regretted the way

I behaved that evening we went out,

and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd

tell you that because I really made

a fool out of myself.

MICKEY

Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be

ridiculous.

HOLLY

(overlapping)

It's all right.

MICKEY

I was the, I was... You know, it

was my fault.  I--

(inhaling)

MICKEY

So, so you want to go out to dinner

again?  I mean, is that, is that...

Have, you have any interest in

that, or...

HOLLY

Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

Do you?  I mean, are you, are you,

are you, are you free this evening?

HOLLY

Yeah.

One year later.

CUT TO:

EVAN

(holding a drink)

I want ice!  Who's got some--

(pointing to an ice

bucket on the table)

Oh, there it is.

HANNAH

(offscreen, overlapping)

It's on the table, Dad.

EVAN

(putting ice into his glass)

Hey, where's Holly?  She's late.

LEE

(walking briskly to

the sink)

Hey, Hannah, did you read that last

thing Holly wrote?  It was great.

She's really developed.

HANNAH

(offscreen, in

another area of the kitchen)

I know, she...she really writes

good dialogue.

LEE

(turning to the

offscreen Hannah)

Yeah.  I'll get some ice.

NORMA

Hannah, can I tell everybody you're

going to play Desdemona?

HANNAH

(taking a big sip of

her wine)

Oh, Mom, it's only television.

(beginning to mash

some sweet potatoes

in a bowl on the table)

NORMA

(gesturing with the bottle)

Yes, but it's public television.

And to me, Shakespeare doesn't get

any greater than Othello.  You with

some big black stud!  I love it!

HANNAH

(gasping and laughing)

Oh, Mom!

EVAN

(overlapping, reacting)

Oh, honey!

ELLIOT (V.O.)

Oh, Lee, you are something.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

You look very beautiful.  Marriage

agrees with you.  Everything that

happened between us

(pausing)

seems more and more hazy.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

I acted like such a fool.  I don't

know what came over me.  That

complete conviction that I couldn't

live without you.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

What did I put us both through?

And Hannah...

ELLIOT (V.O.)

(continuing)

...who as you once said, I love

much more than I realized.

HOLLY

(kissing the children)

Hi!  How are you!

(kissing)

Happy Thanksgiving!

(kissing)

BOY #1

Hi!

HOLLY

I didn't miss dinner, did I?

CHILDREN

(overlapping, talking

at once)

No!

HOLLY

(smiling)

Huh?  Hi, Marge.

FEMALE GUEST #1

(overlapping)

You look lovely.

FEMALE GUEST #2

(overlapping, hugging Holly)

Hello, darling.

HOLLY

Happy Thanksgiving.

FEMALE GUEST #2

(overlapping)

Good to see you.  Same to you.

HOLLY

(hugging the man)

Hello.

HOLLY

(still fixing her

earrings, to Mavis)

It's beautiful.

MICKEY

(smacking his lips)

Now don't get nervous.  It's just

your husband.

HOLLY

(grinning)

Hi.

MICKEY

Hi.

(kissing Holly)

How you doin'?

HOLLY

(nestling against Mickey)

Okay.

MICKEY

When'd you get here?

HOLLY

Just a few minutes ago.

MICKEY

Oh.

(kissing her again)

You look so beautiful.

HOLLY

Thanks.

MICKEY

(kissing Holly's neck)

You know, I was talking with your

father before...and I was telling

him that

(kissing)

it's ironic.  I-I used to always

have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and

I never thought

(kissing)

that I could love anybody else.

(kissing)

And here it is, years later and I'm

married to you

(kissing)

and completely in love with you.

(kissing)

The heart is a very, very resilient

little muscle.

(kissing)

It really is.  I...

(kissing)

It'd made a great story, I think.

A guy marries one sister...

(kissing)

doesn't work out...

(kissing)

many years later...

(kissing)

he winds up

(inhaling)

married to the other sister.  It's,

you know, it's a...

HOLLY

(fondling Mickey's

arm, smiling)

Tch.

MICKEY

(overlapping)

I don't know how you're gonna top

that.

HOLLY

(kissing Mickey's cheek)

Mickey?

MICKEY

(kissing Holly's neck)

Mmm, what?

HOLLY

I'm pregnant.
