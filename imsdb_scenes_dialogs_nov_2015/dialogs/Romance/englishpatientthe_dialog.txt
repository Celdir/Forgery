JAN

There's meant to be lace in the next

village - the boys are taking me.

HANA

I'm not sewing anything else.

JAN

(mischievously)

You don't have any money, do you?

Just in case there's silk.

HANA

No!

JAN

Hana, I know you do!

HANA

I'm not sewing anything else for you!

JAN

(getting the money)

I love you.

KIP

Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!

HARDY

Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!

Hana stops.  Hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.

HARDY

(as he approaches)

Good, that's good, just stay still for me

and then we're going to be fine.

HARDY

What are you doing?!  What the bloody

hell do you think you're doing?

HANA

Do you need something?

MARY

Are you okay?  Oh God, Hana, you were

like sisters.

HANA

(sighs angrily)

We keep moving him - in and out of the

truck.  Why?  He's dying.  What's the point?

MARY

Well, we can't hardly leave him.  Do

you mean leave him?  We can't.

HANA

I must be a curse.  Anybody who loves me,

anybody who gets close to me -

or I must be cursed.  Which is it?

HANA

The war's over - you told me yourself.

How can it be desertion?

OLIVER

It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean

literally.

HANA

When he dies I'll catch up.

OLIVER

It's not safe here.  The whole country's

crawling with Bandits and Germans and God

knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it.

You're not, this is natural - it's shock.

For all of us.  Hana -

HANA

I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.

OLIVER

(clutching at straws)

And what if he really is a spy?

HANA

(impatiently)

He can't even move.

OLIVER

If anything happened to you I'd never

forgive myself.

OLIVER

We're heading for Leghorn.  Livorno the

Italians call it.  We'll expect you.

HANA

Up there.

THE PATIENT

There was a Prince, who was dying, and

he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he

could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills.

Am I that Prince?

HANA

Because you're leaning?  No, you're

just on an angle.  You're too heavy!

HANA

In here.

HANA

Thank you.

HANA

Good.

She goes to Mary and hugs her.

D'AGOSTINO

Thirsty?

MADOX

(sniffing inside)

What's this?

D'AGOSTINO

Don't drink it!

D'AGOSTINO

I can't guarantee the vintage, my

friends.  I just dug it out of the hill.

MADOX

Excellent.  That's terrific, D'Ag.

(to Almasy, of a tool)

Toss that up, would you.

D'AGOSTINO

(mischievously)

There are some others.

MADOX

(to Almasy, astonished)

My God, look at this!

BERMANN

Incredible, Hmm?  Quite incredible.

D'AGOSTINO

I've never seen anything like it.  There

would have been enough water here to

serve an army.

ALMASY

(gloomily)

Which means we're in the wrong place.

D'AGOSTINO

Why?

ALMASY

Would you stockpile water near to an

Oasis?  There can't be a natural spring

within fifty miles of here.

FOUAD

Or they didn't know of one.

BERMANN

So, it may not be Zerzura, still

incredible.

D'AGOSTINO

(nodding, delighted)

A pottery hill!

ALMASY

A wild goose chase.

MADOX

(firmly)

No.

MADOX

No.  Now we look in the other places.

We're eliminating.

MADOX

Good, and here comes reinforcements.

CLIFTON

I hereby Christen us the International

Sand Club!

MADOX

Marvelous plane.  Did you look?

CLIFTON

(beaming at Almasy)

Isn't it?  Wedding present from

Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it

Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.

MADOX

We can finally consign my old bird

to the scrapheap.

Almasy smiles and walks on towards the others.

D'AGOSTINO

Mrs. Clifton - Count Almasy.

KATHARINE

(smiling, offering her hand)

Geoffrey gave me your monograph when

I was reading up on the desert.

Very impressive.

ALMASY

(stiff)

Thank you.

KATHARINE

I wanted to meet a man who could write

such a long paper with so few adjectives.

ALMASY

A thing is still a thing no matter what

you place in front of it.  Big car, slow

car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.

CLIFTON

(joining them and joining in)

A broken car?

ALMASY

Still a car.

CLIFFTON

(hands them champagne)

Not much use, though.

KATHARINE

Love?  Romantic love, platonic love,

filial love - ?  Quite different things,

surely?

CLIFTON

(hugging Katharine)

Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind

of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.

ALMASY

(a dry smile)

There you have me.

THE PATIENT

What was all the banging?  Were you

fighting rats or the entire German army?

HANA

I was repairing the stairs.  I found a

library and the books were very useful.

THE PATIENT

Before you find too many uses for these

books would you read some to me?

HANA

I think they're all in Italian, but I'll

look, yes.  What about your own book?

THE PATIENT

(reluctant)

My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we

can read him.

HANA

Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums

in the orchard.  We have an orchard!

THE PATIENT

Thank you.

THE PATIENT

The plumness of this plum.

THE PATIENT

What's that?

HANA

Water!

(bends to the Tortois)

You hear it, too, don't you!

FOUAD

European, I think, with guides.

CLIFTON

(can only see shapes)

How do you know?

MADOX

(frowns)

Yes, and I think I know who this is.

FENELON-BARNES

Ugly brute.  Shits and roars and

complains all day.

(bypassing Almasy and

Of course, you have your aeroplane.

Two now!  Do you still call yourselves

explorers?  I assume not.

MADOX

(stiffly)

Fenelon-Barnes.

ALMASY

Yes, I think a sailor can call himself an

explorer, can't he?  Or should Columbus

have swum to America?

MADOX

I think you know all of us, except for

Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've

recently come out from England.

CLIFTON

Apprentices.

MADOX

This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.

FENELON-BARNES

(to Katharine)

I know your mother, of course.

KATHARINE

Hello.

FENELON-BARNES

I'm also searching for the lost Oasis,

but by more authentic means.

MADOX

(of Almasy)

Anyway, my friend here has a new theory -

that Zerzura doesn't exist.  So we may all

be chasing windmills.  Have some food.

FENELON-BARNES

Well, it's certainly not between here and

Dakhla.  Nine days of nothing but sand

and sandstorms.  An egg.  I found an

ostrich egg and some fossils.

KATHARINE

Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by

spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?

ALMASY

What kind of fossils?

FENELON-BARNES

I'll invite you to my paper at the

Royal Geographical Society.

Are you still a member?

ALMASY

I think you know I am.

FENELON-BARNES

(ignoring Almasy)

Quite impossible, Madox.  You must know

that.  If you attempt to cross the Sand

Sea due east of Kufra by car you'll leave

your bones in the sand for me to collect.

ALMASY

(leaving the tent)

If you come across my bones - I hope

you'll do me the honor of leaving

them in peace.

(to Katharine)

Excuse me.

FENELON-BARNES

You have my word as a gentleman.

(watching him leave)

I've discovered a unique type of

sand-dune.  I've applied to the King

for permission to call it

The Fenelon-Barnes Formation.

LATER, supper over, the company is entertaining itself.

KATHARINE

I can't sing.

(the audience groans)

but I can tell a story.

(to Almasy, who has arrived)

I might need a prompt.  Do you have your

Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it...

ALMASY

I'm sorry - what have you noticed?

MADOX

Your book.  Your Herodotus!

KATHARINE

(reacting quickly)

It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can

muddle through.  Okay - The Story of

Candaules and Gyges.  King Candaules was

passionately in love with his wife -

(Geoffrey whistles proudly)

One day he said to Gyges, the son of

somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -

ALMASY

(quietly prompting her)

Daskylus...

KATHARINE

(smiles)

Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus -

Candaules said to him I don't think you

believe me when I tell you how beautiful

my wife is.  And although Gyges replied he

did find the Queen magnificent the King

insisted he would find some way to prove

beyond dispute that she was fairest of

all women.  Do you all know this story?

HANA

(reading from the Herodotus)

I will hide you in the room where

we sleep, said Candaules.

THE PATIENT

Candaules

HANA

(not neurotic)

Candaules...you're laughing at me.

THE PATIENT

I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.

HANA

When my wife comes to lie down she always

lays her garments one by one on a seat

near the entrance of the room, and from

where you stand you will be able to gaze

on her at your leisure...

KATHARINE

(her story continuing)

And that evening, it's exactly as the

King had told him, she goes to the chair

and removes her clothes, one by one,

until she stand naked in full view of

Gyges.  And indeed she was more lovely

than he could have imagined.

KATHARINE

But then the Queen looked up and saw

Gyges concealed in the shadows.   And

though she said nothing, she shuddered.

The next day she sent for Gyges and

challenged him.  And hearing his story,

she said this -

CLIFTON

Off with his head!

KATHERINE

#NAME?

death for gazing on that which you

should not, or else kill my husband who

shamed me and become King in his place.

KATHERINE

So Gyges killed the King and married

the Queen and became ruler of Lydia

for twenty eight years.  The End.

(an uncomfortable moment)

Do I spin the bottle?

MADOX

(to Clifton)

And let that be a lesson to you!

HANA

Are you asleep?

THE PATIENT

(lying)

Yes.  Dropping off.

MADOX

What did you think you were

doing in his tent?

ALMASY

Looking for the fossils.  Why should we

wait until we're in London?  This girl

was probably twelve years old.

MADOX

(getting into the plane)

You shouldn't go into another man's tent.

It's inexcusable.

ALMASY

Her hands and feet were tied.

MADOX

What did you do?

ALMASY

I looked at them.  They're shrubs,

small trees.  Exquisite.  And

fossilized, rock hard.

MADOX

I was talking about the girl.

ALMASY

Cut the ropes.  I left a note,

on his blanket.

(gleefully)

At the next Geographical Society I

shall await with great interest the

announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes

Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave,

of course.  Her father had sold her

for a camel.

HANA

I should try and move your bed.  I want

you to be able to see the view.  It's

good, it's a view from a monastery.

THE PATIENT

I can already see.

HANA

(bending down to his level)

How?  How can you see anything?

THE PATIENT

Not the window - I can't bear the light

anyway - no, I can see all the way to

the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.

HANA

I'm turning you.

THE PATIENT

Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the

Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the

scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can

smell it.  The taste of tea so black it

falls into your mouth.  I can taste it.

I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my

eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

HANA

No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.

THE PATIENT

I can see my wife in that view.

HANA

Are you remembering more?

THE PATIENT

Could I have a cigarette?

HANA

Are you crazy?

THE PATIENT

Why are you so determined to

keep me alive?

HANA

Because I'm a nurse.

HANA

How are you?

BOY

Okay.

HANA

Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel

came out - I saved you the pieces.

BOY

You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.

HANNA

(she hears this every day)

I don't think so.

BOY

Would you kiss me?

HANA

No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till

you're in Naples.  You'll find a

girl there.

BOY

(innocent)

Just kiss me.  It would mean

such a lot to me.

HANA

(tender, believing him)

Would it?

BOY

Thank you.

#1 INJURED MAN

Nurse - I can't sleep.

#2 INJURED MAN

Nurse?  Would you kiss me?

#3 INJURED MAN

You're so pretty!

#4 INJURED MAN

Hinky-dinky parlez-vous!

HANA

(good-naturedly waving

Very funny.  Go to sleep.

MARY

Don't ask.

HANA

Where are we going?  I don't want to be

kissing in a crowd.  I have six hours.

STUART

(laughing at her ferocity)

Whoa - give me a chance!

HANA

Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.

STUART

I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go

to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.

HANA

I'd like to spend a night with you

in a bed.

STUART

We can do that when we're very very old.

CARAVAGGIO

(very cheerful)

Buon' Giorno!

CARAVAGGIO

Are you Hana?

HANA

What do you want?

CARAVAGGIO

I met your friend Mary.  She said I

should stop and see if you were okay.

Apparently we're neighbors - my house

is two blocks from yours in Montreal.

Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.

HANA

(unraveling this information)

Bonjour.

CARAVAGGIO

I'd like to take credit, but it's from

Mary.  My name's David Caravaggio,

but nobody ever called me David.

Caravaggio they find to absurd to

miss out on.

CARAVAGGIO

They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg

in...have you noticed there are chickens?

You get chickens in Italy but no eggs.

In Africa there were always eggs, but

never chickens.  Who separates them?

HANA

You were in Africa?

CARAVAGGIO

Yeah, for a while.

HANA

So was my Patient.

CARAVAGGIO

I'd like to stay.  That's the long and

short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah

if it's convenient, if there's room

blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some

work here -I speak the language.

There are Partisans to be -

(trying to paraphrase)

#NAME?

relieve them of their weapons, you

know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so

they think I'd be good at that.

HANA

So you can shoot a pistol?

CARAVAGGIO

(showing his hands)

No.

HANA

If you said yes I would have had a

reason.  You should let me redress

those bandages.  Before you go.

CARAVAGGIO

I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house.  We

needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot

a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I

don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.

HANA

Because we're fine here.  I don't know

what Mary told you about me, but I

don't need company, I don't need

to be looked at.

CARAVAGGIO

Fine.  I'm not looking.

HANA

There's a man downstairs.  He

brought us eggs.

(shows him the omelette)

He might stay.

THE PATIENT

Why?  Can he lay eggs?

HANA

He's Canadian.

THE PATIENT

(brittle)

Why are people always so happy when

they collide with someone from the same

place?  What happened in Montreal when

you passed a man in the street - did you

invite him to live with you?

HANA

He needn't disturb you.

THE PATIENT

Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.

HANA

He won't disturb us then.  I think

he's after morphine.

(she's cut the omelette

There's a war.  Where you come from

becomes important.  And besides -

we're vulnerable here.  I keep hearing

noises in the night.  Voices.

Caravaggio is in the shadows on the stairs.  HE LISTENS.

ALMASY

How much did you pay?

KATHARINE

(delighted)

Hello!  Good morning.

ALMASY

They don't see foreign women in this

market.  How much did you pay?

KATHARINE

Seven pounds, eight, I suppose.  Why?

ALMASY

Which stall?

KATHARINE

Excuse me?

ALMASY

You've been cheated, don't worry,

we'll take it back.

KATHARINE

(bristling)

I don't want to go back.

ALMASY

This is not worth eight pounds,

Mrs. Clifton.

KATHARINE

I don't care to bargain.

ALMASY

That insults them.

KATHARINE

(turning to face him)

I don't believe that.  I think you are

insulted by me, somehow.  You're a

foreigner too, aren't you, here,

in this market?

ALMASY

(of the carpet)

I should be very happy to obtain

the correct price for this.  I apologize

if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at

social graces.

(tart)

How do you find Cairo?  Did you

visit the Pyramids?

KATHARINE

Excuse me.

CLIFTON

Gentlemen, good evening!

D'AGOSTINO

How is your charming wife?

CLIFTON

Uh, marvelous.  She's in love with

the hotel plumbing.  She's either in

the swimming pool - she swims for

hours, she's a fish, quite incredible -

or she's in the bath.  Actually,

she's just outside.

(responding to their

Chaps Only in the Long Bar.

MADOX

(standing, embarrassed)

Of course.  Well, we should all go

out onto the terrace.

CLIFTON

Oh no, really.  She has her book.

MADOX

I won't hear of it.  None of us will.

MADOX

Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive

us.  We're not accustomed to the

company of women.

KATHARINE

Not at all.  I was thoroughly

enjoying by book.

(indicating they should all sit

Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.

CLIFTON

The team is in mourning, darling.

KATHARINE

Oh really?

MADOX

I'm afraid we're not having much luck

obtaining funds for the expedition.

KATHARINE

How awful.  What will you do?

MADOX

A more modest expedition, or even wait a

year.  Remind our families we still exist.

CLIFTON

(astonished)

Good heavens, are you married, Madox?

MADOX

Very much so.  We are all, save my

friend here.

CLIFTON

I feel much better, don't you darling?

We were feeling rather self-conscious.

Let's toast, then.  To absent wives.

D'AGOSTINO

(toasting Katharine)

And present ones.

KATHARINE

(toasting Almasy)

And future ones.

KATHARINE

Why did you follow me yesterday?

ALMASY

Excuse me?

KATHARINE

After the market, you followed me

to the hotel.

ALMASY

I was concerned.  As I said, women in

that part of Cairo, a European women,

I felt obliged to.

KATHARINE

You felt obliged to.

ALMASY

As the wife of one of our party.

KATHARINE

(sardonic)

So why follow me?  Escort me, by

all means.  Following me is

predatory, isn't it?

CLIFTON

I was just saying, I'm going to cable

Downing Street, see if I can't stir up

a few shillings - Katharine's mother

and the PM's wife are best -

KATHARINE

(interrupting)

Darling, for goodness' sake!

CLIFTON

Well, she is!

CARAVAGGIO

Hello.

THE PATIENT

Finally!  So you're our

Canadian pickpocket?

He goes to help Hana, they work as he talks.

CARAVAGGIO

Thief, I think, is more accurate.

THE PATIENT

I understand you were in Africa.

Whereabouts?

CARAVAGGIO

Oh, all over.

THE PATIENT

All over?  I kept trying to cover

a very modest portion and still failed.

(to Hana)

Are you leaving us?  Now's our

opportunity to swap war wounds.

HANA

Then I'm definitely going.

CARAVAGGIO

Does she have war wounds?

THE PATIENT

I think anybody she ever loves

tends to die on her.

CARAVAGGIO

Are you planning to be the exception?

THE PATIENT

Me?  You've got the wrong end of

the stick, old boy.

(a pause)

So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you

invented your name.

CARAVAGGIO

And you've forgotten yours.

THE PATIENT

I told her you would never invent

such a preposterous name.

CARAVAGGIO

I told her you can forget everything

but you never forget your name.

OFFICER (O/S)

What about your rank or serial number?

THE PATIENT (O/S)

No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found

near the wreckage of a plane by the

Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.

OFFICER

Do you remember where you were born?

THE PATIENT

Am I being interrogated?  You should be

trying to trick me.  Ask me about

Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace.

About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make

me speak German, which I can, by the way.

OFFICER

Why?  Are you German?

THE PATIENT

No.

OFFICER

How do you know you're not German if

you don't remember anything?

THE PATIENT

You tell me.  I remember a lot of things.

I remember a garden, plunging down to

the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called

it - and there was a cottage at the

bottom, right on the shore, nothing

between you and France.

OFFICER

This was your garden?

THE PATIENT

Or my wife's.

OFFICER

Then you were married?

THE PATIENT

I think so.  Although I believe that

to be true of a number of Germans.

Might I have a glass of water?

THE PATIENT

Thank you.

(he sips)

Look - my lungs are useless -

(makes a small gap with

I've got this much lung...the rest

of my organs are packing up -

what could it possibly matter if I

were Tutankhamun?  I'm a bit of

toast, my friend - butter me and

slip a poached egg on top.

STUART

My leave is canceled.  I can't

meet you later.

Hana enters, approaches the Patient.  She's circumspect.

HANA

Excuse me -

THE PATIENT

Yes?

HANA

Can I ask - my friend, can he come in?

Just for a few minutes?

THE PATIENT

Your friend?

HANA

He's going back to the front this

evening.  I can't see him otherwise.

THE PATIENT

Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.

HANA

No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't

offended, it would be very good of you

to allow us - every other cabin is crammed.

This is as private as we'll get.

THE PATIENT

Well then - yes.  Of course.

HANA

Thank you.  Thank you.

HANA

This is Captain McGann.

THE PATIENT

Please, don't waste your time on

pleasantries -

STUART

Thanks.

THE PATIENT

I'm going to sing.  If I sing I shan't

hear anything.

HANA

(touching his lip)

You've got a mustache.

STUART

A bit of one.

HANA

I was looking forward to this evening.

STUART

(whispers)

I had a hotel room.

HANA

(whispers)

I thought that was for when we

were very very old?

STUART

I'm feeling old.

CARAVAGGIO

Supper.

HANA

Where've you been?

CARAVAGGIO

(not stopping)

Rabbit hunting.

HANA

I could help you.  I could

get you off that.

CARAVAGGIO

Can you cook the rabbit or will you

try and bring that back to life?

HANA

It's a week.  We didn't know where you

were - or if you coming back, or -

CARAVAGGIO

(of the drugs)

You should be happy.  What were you

going to do for him when it ran out?

HANA

What do you do?  What are you doing here?

CARAVAGGIO

Some gave me a dress.

(starts to tear at a parcel)

You know what's great?  What I'm learning?

You win a war and you not only gain the

miles you get the moral ground.

Everywhere I go, we're in the right.

I like that.

THE PATIENT

Something smells so rich.  My

stomach is heaving -

HANA

He came back, he says he caught a

rabbit.  I'm cooking it.

THE PATIENT

That's a different dress.

HANA

He keeps asking me questions about you.

Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?

THE PATIENT

Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is.

I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read

Italian.  He can catch rabbits.

KATHARINE

(diffident)

Hello.  Not to interrupt but

we're celebrating.

ALMASY

This is an incredible story - about a man

hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me

about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there,

but his map, the route he's describing,

he couldn't survive the journey now, but

he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and

now we're onto an Ostrich.

(to the Arab in ARABIC)

I'm telling her your map is poetry.

KATHARINE

What do you mean, poetry?

ALMASY

A mountain curved like a woman's back,

a plateau the shape of an ear.

KATHARINE

Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does

the Ostrich come in?

ALMASY

The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts

an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do

with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must

appear not to move.  The man finds a place

where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands

where the ostrich can see him, on the

horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat -

otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall,

he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the

ostrich comes the next day, the man is

there, but he's nearer.

(to the guide)

Haunting the ostrich.

ALMASY

Yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family,

not just the meat, but by selling the

feathers, beak, the skin, a year from

this one animal.  So, each day the

man gets closer.  And the ostrich is

not sure - has something changed? -

now the standing man is only a few

yards from where it feeds.  And then

one day, the man is in the wadi, in

the water.  And the Ostrich comes, as

always, dips into the water and the

man JUMPS UP - and captures it.

KATHARINE

What is he saying?

(Almasy, awkward, shakes his head)

Come on, what did he say?

ALMASY

He said - be careful.

KATHARINE

Be careful?  You mean you - or me?  Who?

ALMASY

(to the Arab)

Her or me?

ALMASY

The one who appears not to be moving.

CLIFTON

Gentlemen, to Zerzura.

ALL

Zerzura.

MADOX

And a special thank you to Geoffrey

and Katharine, without whose

fund-raising heroics we should

still be kicking our heels.

CLIFTON

To arm-twisting.

MADOX

(to Almasy)

Did Katharine say? -

Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.

CLIFTON

Have to return the favor - take a few

photographs for the army.

KATHARINE

Darling, Peter says I could stay...

MADOX

(checking with Almasy)

Why not?

ALMASY

What kind of photographs?

CLIFTON

Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's

wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier

at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.

KATHARINE

(to Clifton)

Why do you think?  About my staying?

CLIFTON

Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then

I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft...

KATHARINE

(playfully poking his ribs)

Oh.

CLIFTON

But finally able to explore the Cairo

night-life.  I shall produce an

authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars

and - I want to say Harems - am I in

the right country for Harems?

ALMASY

Safe journey.

CLIFTON

You too.  Good luck!

ALMASY

Clifton - your wife - do you think

it's appropriate to leave her?

CLIFTON

Appropriate?

ALMASY

I think the desert is, it's - for a

woman - it's very tough, I wonder

if it's not too much for her.

CLIFTON

Are you mad?  Katharine loves it

here. She told me yesterday.

ALMASY

All the same, I, were I you I would

be concerned -

CLIFTON

I've known Katharine since she was

three, my aunt is her aunt, we were

practically brother and sister before

we were man and wife.  I think I'd

know what is and what isn't too much

for her.  I think she's know herself.

ALMASY

Very well.

CLIFTON

(laughing it off)

Why are you people so threatened

by a woman?!

KATHARINE

I've been thinking about - how does

somebody like you decide to come to

the desert?  What is it?  You're doing

whatever you're doing - in your castle,

or wherever it is you live, and one day,

you say, I have to go to the desert - or what?

ALMASY

I once traveled with a terrific guide,

who was taking me to Faya.  He didn't

speak for nine hours.  At the end of

it he pointed at the horizon and

said - Faya!  That was a good day!

KATHARINE

Actually, you sing.

ALMASY

Pardon?

KATHARINE

You sing.  All the time.

ALMASY

I do not.

KATHARINE

Ask Al Auf.

KATHARINE

(sings wickedly)

I'll be down to get you in the taxi,

honey, you'd better be ready about

half-past eight...!

AL AUF

Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar...

ALMASY

Madox!  Madox!

MADOX

(with audible excitement)

My God, they're swimming!

D'AGOSTINO

Have you seen this?  Astonishing.

Perfectly preserved.

BERMANN

I love the desert, you see.  That's my,

that's my - I can't think of the word.

(Almasy nods)

How do you explain?  To someone who's

never been here?  Feelings which seem

quite normal.

ALMASY

(compassionate)

I don't know, my friend.  I don't know.

MADOX

I'll be back as quick as I can.

Thirty-six hours at the outside.

ALMASY

Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury

it between here and the Pottery Hill.

And a better jack.  We planned badly.

MADOX

(nods at Almasy, then shouts over

Bermann!

KAMAL

May God make safety your companion.

KATHARINE

I shall stay behind, of course

MADOX

Certainly not.

KATHARINE

I insist.  There clearly isn't room for

us all, I'm the least able to dig, and

I'm not one of the walking wounded.

Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain

it's the most effective method of

persuading my husband to abandon

whatever he's doing and rescue us.

ALMASY

What's this?

KATHARINE

I thought you might paste them

into your book.

ALMASY

We took several photographs,

there's no need.

KATHARINE

I'd like you to have them.

ALMASY

(handing them back)

There's really no need.  This is

just a scrapbook.  I should feel

obliged.  Thank you.

KATHARINE

(exasperated)

And that would be unconscionable,

I suppose, to feel any obligation?

Yes.  Of course it would.

ALMASY

You should come into the shelter.

KATHARINE

I'm quite all right, thank you.

ALMASY

Look over there.

KATHARINE

What am I looking at?

ALMASY

See what's happening to them -

the stars.

KATHARINE

They're so untidy.  I'm just trying

to rearrange them.

ALMASY

In an hour there will be no stars.

The air is filling with sand.

KATHARINE

This is not very good, is it?

ALMASY

No.

KATHARINE

Shall we be all right?

ALMASY

Yes.  Absolutely.

KATHARINE

Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.

ALMASY (O/S)

...let me tell you about winds.  There

is a whirlwind in Southern Morocco, the

Aajej, against which the fellahin defend

themselves with knives.  The Ghibli from

Tunis rolls and rolls and produces a

rather strange nervous condition...

ALMASY

#NAME?

Which Mariners called the sea of

darkness.  Red sand from this wind

has flown as far as the south coast

of England, producing showers so

dense they were mistaken for blood.

KATHARINE

Fiction.  We had a house on that coast

and it never rained blood.  Go on.  More.

ALMASY

All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells

of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a

nation declared war on it and marched

out to fight it in full battle dress,

their swords raised.

KATHARINE

Our tracks, where are they?

ALMASY

Madox will have calculated how many

miles, they'll soon turn around.

KATHARINE

(realizing what he's doing)

Oh my God, the others!

ALMASY

(during this)

Could I ask you, please, to paste you

paintings into my book?  I should like

to have them.  I should be honored.

KATHARINE

Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible

coward to ask how much water we have?

ALMASY

(shoveling hard)

Water?  Yes, we have water, we have

a little in our can, we have water in

the radiator which can be drunk.  Not

at all cowardly, extremely practical.

(anxious at not uncovering

Come on, come on!

(then back to Katharine)

There's also a plant - I've never seen

it but I'm told you can cut a piece the

size of a heart from this plant and

the next day it will be filled with a

delicious liquid.

KATHARINE

Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.

ALMASY

Kamal is passing blood.  He must have

had some internal damage in the crash.

He needs medicine.  I think we must risk

the other flare.

KATHARINE

(blank)

Geoffrey's not in Cairo.

(Almasy looks at her)

He's not actually a buffoon.  And

the plane wasn't a wedding

present.  It belongs to the British

Government.  They want aerial

maps of the whole North Africa.

So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In

case you were counting on his

sudden appearance.

ALMASY

And the marriage - is that a fiction?

KATHARINE

No, the marriage isn't a fiction.

KATHARINE

Thank God.  Oh, thank God.

KATHARINE

Do they know them?

ALMASY

(squinting at the horizon)

No, but I think I do.

KATHARINE

Am I K. in your book?

I think I must be.

FENELON-BARNES

I recollect your saying to ignore

your bones but I assume you have

no objection to my rescuing your

companion?

(to Katharine)

Good evening, Mrs. Clifton.

KATHARINE

(accepting his handshake)

Hello.

FENELON-BARNES

I'd like to introduce you to my camel -

the most notable beast on earth.

(to Almasy)

I understand you found some

remarkable caves.

FENELON-BARNES

Paintings of swimmers?  Remarkable.

KATHARINE

Will you not come in?

ALMASY

No.

KATHARINE

Will you please come in?

ALMASY

(a beat)

Mrs. Clifton -

Katharine turns, disgusted.

KATHARINE

Don't.

ALMASY

I believe you still have my book.

KATHARINE

You still have sand in your hair.

KATHARINE

I'm impressed you can sew.

ALMASY

Good.

KATHARINE

You sew very badly.

ALMASY

You don't sew at all!

KATHARINE

A woman should never learn to sew,

and if she can she should never

admit to it.  Close your eyes.

ALMASY

(laughs)

That makes it harder still.

ALMASY

When were you most happy?

KATHARINE

Now.

ALMASY

When were you least happy?

KATHARINE

(a beat)

Now.

ALMASY

Okay.  And what do you love?

Say everything.

KATHARINE

What do I love?  I love rice pudding,

and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs!

The gardens at our house in Freshwater -

all my secret paths.

ALMASY

What else?

KATHARINE

Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not

with other people!  Islands.  Your

handwriting.  I could go on all day.

(a beat)

My husband.

Almasy nods.

ALMASY

What do you hate most?

KATHARINE

A lie.  What do you hate most?

ALMASY

Ownership.  Being owned.  When

you leave, you should forget me.

THE PATIENT

Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry -

but when you turn, the sheets, I can't

really bear the sheets moving over me.

Sorry.

HANA

(mortified, moving quickly)

Yes, of course, I'm so sorry.

Stupid of me.

Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.

HANA

I'm so sorry.

MARY

Okay, Type Os, the vampires wait.

Everybody's giving a pint.

JAN

Ugh!  If they were sucking it out

I wouldn't mind.  It's the needle

I can't stand.

HANA

(laughing)

You're a nurse - how ca you be

frightened of needles!

WOUNDED SOLDIER

Can't wait to have me dead?  You bitch!

HANA

Try t be calm.  Ssssshhh.  Come on.

Be calm now.  Ssshhhh.  Be peaceful.

It's okay.  It's okay.

CANADIAN SOLDIER

(whispering to Oliver)

Is there anybody here from Picton?

OLIVER

Picton?  I don't know.

CANADIAN SOLDIER

I'd like to see somebody from home

before I go.

HANA

(to Oliver)

Why Picton?

OLIVER

He's from there - edge of Lake

Ontario right, Soldier?

JAN

(innocent)

Where's your Stuart from?

Somewhere near there, isn't it?

HANA

(to Oliver)

As him what company he's with?

OLIVER

Third Canadian Fusiliers.

HANA

Does he know a Captain McGann?

CANADIAN SOLDIER

He bought it.  Yesterday.  Shot to bits.

HANA

What did he say?

OLIVER

(can't look at her)

Doesn't know him.

HANA

He's gone, hasn't he?

OLIVER

No.  He's - no.

HANA

Oh God.  Oh God.

CARAVAGGIO

Hana?

(he touches her shoulder)

Hana?  Are you alright?

HANA

(without raising her head)

Don't touch me if you're going to

try and fuck me.

CARAVAGGIO

(soothing)

I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.

CARAVAGGIO

(gently)

You have to protect yourself from

sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.

(drinking the water)

You're in love with him, aren't you?

Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint

or something?  Because of the way he

looks?  I don't think he is.

HANA

I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love

with ghosts.  And so is he.  He's in

love with ghosts.

CARAVAGGIO

Who are his ghosts?

HANA

Ask him.

CARAVAGGIO

(he holds up his hands)

What if I told you he did this to me?

HANA

(stung)

What?  How could he have?  When?

CARAVAGGIO

I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't

even know.  It's like he slammed a

door in Cairo and it trapped my

fucking hands in Tobruk.

HANA

I don't know what that means.

CARAVAGGIO

(shrugs)

Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is.

Ask him who he's killed.

HANA

(furious)

Please don't creep around this house.

HANA

Tell me about this, this is in your

handwriting - December 22nd -

Betrayals in war are childlike

compared with our betrayals during

peace.  New lovers are nervous and

tender, but smash everything - for

the heart is an organ of fire...

(she looks up)

I love that, I believe that.

(to him)

Who is K?

THE PATIENT

K is for Katharine.

ALMASY

Say you're sick.

KATHARINE

What?  No!

ALMASY

Say you're feeling faint - the sun.

KATHARINE

(but a frisson)

No.

ALMASY

I can't work.  I can't sleep.

LADY HAMPTON

Katharine!

KATHARINE

Coming.

(to Almasy)

I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting

in the middle of the night.  Geoffrey

thinks it's the thing in the desert,

the trauma.

ALMASY

I can still taste you.

KATHARINE

(waving at another woman who

This is empty, just coming!

ALMASY

I'm trying to write with your taste

in my mouth.

(as she leaves)

Swoon.  I'll catch you.

KATHARINE

I'm fine.  How silly.

OFFICER'S WIFE

(helping her to her feet)

It's the heat.

LADY HAMPTON

You should sit down, darling.

(to the others)

She's quite all right.

(escorts Katharine away)

Are you pregnant?

KATHARINE

I don't think so.

LADY HAMPTON

(squeezing her arm)

How romantic.  With Fiona I fell

over every five minutes.  Ronnie

Christened me Lady Downfall.

KATHARINE

I think I might go inside and sit

down for a few minutes.

LADY HAMPTON

I'll come with you.

KATHARINE

No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine.

CLIFTON

Have you seen Katharine?

ALMASY

(taken aback)

What?

CLIFTON

It's Geoffrey under this.

ALMASY

I haven't, no.  Sorry.

CLIFTON

Darling, I just heard.  You poor

sausage, are you all right?

KATHARINE

I'm fine.  I got hot.

CLIFTON

Lady H said she thought you might be -

KATHARINE

I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.

CLIFTON

Right.

KATHARINE

Aren't you?

CLIFTON

Sweltering.

(taking off his hat and beard)

Come on, I'll take you home.

KATHARINE

Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe.

Aren't you dying for green, anything

green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel

rain on your face?  It's Christmas and

it's all - I don't know - if you asked me

I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.

CLIFTON

Sweetheart, you know we can't go

home, there might be a war.

KATHARINE

(poking at his costume)

Geoffrey, you do so love putting

on a disguise.

CLIFTON

I do so love you.

(he kisses her head)

What do you smell of?

KATHARINE

What?

CLIFTON

Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan

in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.

THE PATIENT

Are you outside?

CARAVAGGIO

I can't hide anymore.

(jerks up his hands)

I breathe like a dog.  I lose my

balance.  Stealing's got harder.

CARAVAGGIO

Why do I feel if I had your book I

would know everything?

THE PATIENT

I don't even know if it is my book.

The Bedouin found it in the plane,

in the wreckage.  It's mine now.

I heard your breathing and thought

it might be rain.  I'm dying for rain -

of course I'm dying anyway - but I

long to feel rain on my face.

CARAVAGGIO

Is it you?  If I said Moose... I look

different, fuck, why shouldn't you?

THE PATIENT

(impassive)

Moose.

CARAVAGGIO

(a different tack)

First wedding anniversary - what

do you call it?

THE PATIENT

I don't know.  Paper.  Is it?  Paper?

(sharp, not wanting to think)

I don't remember.

THE PATIENT

I have come to love that little tap of

the fingernail against the syringe.  Tap.

HANA

Excuse me.  Yes?

(of the doors)

I don't have the key to that door.

KIP

The Germans were here.  The Germans

were all over this area.  They left mines

everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite

hiding places.

HANA

I see.

(then mischievous)

Then may be you're safe as long as

you only play Bach.  He's German.

KIP

Is something funny?

HANA

No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry.

You came to the doors, that's all and -

(a little laugh)

#NAME?

worried about mines.  That's all.

KIP

I've met you before.

HANA

I don't think so.

HANA

He wants us to move out, says there

could be fifty more mines in the building.

He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at

him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.

THE PATIENT

Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.

HANA

I'll probably marry him.

THE PATIENT

Really?  That's sudden.

HANA

My mother always told me I would

summon my husband by playing the piano.

HANA

I liked it better when there were

just the two of us.

THE PATIENT

Why?  Is he staying?

HANA

With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.

THE PATIENT

We should charge!  Doesn't anyone

have a job to do?

HANA

They have to clear all the local roads

of mines.  That's a big job.  They won't

stay in the house.  They're putting up

their tent in the garden.

THE PATIENT

In that case, I suppose we can't charge.

CLIFTON

(into the phone)

Darling, it's me, I'm sorry,

something's come up.

(Katharine responds)

Don't sulk - I'll be back tomorrow

evening.  I promise.

(Katharine responds)

Okay my precious, I love you.

RUPERT

I didn't know you were going anywhere?

CLIFTON

I'm not.  I'm going to surprise her.

It's our anniversary.  She's forgotten,

of course.  What's the symbol for your

first anniversary?  I should get something.

Is it paper?

(he knocks sharply on the wall)

Moose!  Moose, you there?  First

Anniversary - is it cotton?

CARAVAGGIO

Is what cotton?

CLIFTON

First Wedding Anniversary.

RUPERT

(of Clifton)

He's hopeless!

CLIFTON

Your day will come, my sausage.

CARAVAGGIO

Your first anniversary is Paper.

CLIFTON

Stop!

CABBIE

Please?

CLIFTON

Stop here.

CABBIE

Yessir.

KATHARINE

This is - what is this?

ALMASY

It's a folk song.

KATHARINE

Arabic?

ALMASY

No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka

sang it to me.

KATHARINE

(as they listen)

It's beautiful.  What's it about?

ALMASY

(as if interpreting)

It's a long song - Szerelem means

love...and the story - there's a

Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer,

a fool.  For years he's on some kind

of quest, who knows what?  And then

one day he falls under the spell of a

mysterious English woman - a

harpy - who beats him and hits him

and he becomes her slave.  He sews

her clothes, he worships the hem of -

ALMASY

(laughing)

Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!

KATHARINE

You bastard, I was believing you!

ALMASY

I claim this shoulder blade - oh no,

wait - I want this!

ALMASY

This - what's it called? - this place,

I love it - this is mine!

(Katharine doesn't know)

I'm asking the King permission to

call it the Almasy Bosphorous.

KATHARINE

(teasing)

I thought we were against ownership?

(kissing him)

I can stay tonight.

ALMASY

Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to

warn me.  He keeps talking about

Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea

of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea

of a man-to-man chat.

KATHARINE

This is a different world - is what

I tell myself.  A different life.

And here I am a different wife.

ALMASY

Yes.  A different wife.

CLIFTON

Sorry.

CABBIE

Hotel now, sir?

GEOFFREY

No.

ALMASY

I don't care to bargain.

(she smiles)

It's full of saffron, just in case

you think I'm giving it to you to

encourage your sewing.

KATHARINE

That day, had you followed me

to the market?

ALMASY

Of course.  You didn't need to slap

my face to make me feel as if you'd

slapped my face.

KATHARINE

(loving him, but frightened)

Shall we be all right?

ALMASY

Yes.  Yes.

(shrugs)

Absolutely.

CARAVAGGIO

(grinning)

Thought you'd never wake up!

THE PATIENT

What?

HANA

Where did you find that?

CARAVAGGIO

I liberated it.

HANA

I think that's called looting.

CARAVAGGIO

(relaxed)

No-one should own music.  The real

question is who wrote the song?

THE PATIENT

Irving Berlin.

CARAVAGGIO

For?

THE PATIENT

Top Hat.

CARAVAGGIO

Is there a song you don't know?

HANA

(speaking for him)

No.  He sings all the time.

HANA

Good morning.

(of his singing)

Did you know that?  You're always singing?

THE PATIENT

I've been told that before.

HANA

Kip's another one.

HANA

Hello.

HARDY

Hello miss.

HANA

I was going to say - if you want to

eat with us, ever... you and Lieutenant

Singh...

HARDY

Very kind of you, we can always eat in

the town with the others -

HANA

Since Caravaggio turned up - food

seems to appear, so please.

HARDY

I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.

HANA

You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.

(Hardy waves that away)

I thought you were very very tall.  You

seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt

like a child who can't keep her balance.

HARDY

(does a little mime)

A toddler

HANA

Sorry, is it all right I'm seeing this?

HANA

My hair was long.  At some point.

I've forgotten what a nuisance it is

to wash.  You know - if you were ever

around - we get water from the pump

at noon.

HANA

Try this.  I found a great jar of it.

Olive oil.  In Naples this was so

precious it would have bought you a wife.

KIP

Thank you.

KIP

For my hair?

HANA

(turning, smiling)

Yes, for your hair.

THE PATIENT (O/S)

Because you're reading it too fast!

THE PATIENT (O/S)

Not at all.

THE PATIENT (O/S)

You have to read Kipling slowly!

Your eye is too impatient - think

about the speed of his pen.

(quoting Kipling to demonstrate)

What is it - He sat comma in defiance

of municipal orders comma astride the

gun Zamzammah on her brick... What is it?

KIP

Brick platform opposite the old

Ajaib-Gher -

THE PATIENT

#NAME?

natives called the Lahore Museum.

KIP

It's still there, the cannon, outside the

museum.  It was made of metal cups

and bowls taken from every household

in the city as tax, then melted down.

Then later they fired the cannon at my

people - comma - The natives.

THE PATIENT

So what do you really object to - the

writer or what he's writing about?

KIP

What I really object to, Uncle, is

your finishing all my condensed milk.

(snatching up the empty can)

And the message everywhere in your

book - however slowly I read it - that

the best destiny for India is to be ruled

by the British.

THE PATIENT

Hana, we have discovered a shared

please - the boy and I.

HANA

Arguing about books.

THE PATIENT

Condensed milk - one of the truly

great inventions.

KIP

(grinning, leaving)

I'll get another tin.

HANA

I didn't like that book either.  It's

all about men.  Too many men.

Just like this house.

THE PATIENT

You like him, don't you?  Your

voice changes.

HANA

I don't think it does.

(a beat)

Anyway, he's indifferent to me.

THE PATIENT

I don't think it's indifference.

THE PATIENT

Hana was just telling me that you

were indifferent -

HANA

(appalled)

Hey! -

THE PATIENT

#NAME?

KIP

Well, I'm indifferent to cooking, not

Hana's cooking in particular.

(stabbing at the tin with a bayonet)

Have either of you ever tried

condensed milk sandwiches?

THE PATIENT

(no irony)

Careful - careful!

THE PATIENT

This is wonderful!

KIP

(to Hana)

What's he saying?

HANA

He's saying it's wonderful!

MADOX

(pushing away his charts)

And I'm telling you there's nothing

there to explore.

ALMASY

No, because you can't see from the air!

If you could explore from the air life

would be very simple!

(he yanks up a map)

Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi?

That whole spur is a real possibility...

MADOX

Which we've overflown twice.

ALMASY

Which we couldn't explore because

of rocks, because of cross-winds,

it's sloppy.

(stabbing another location)

And here - and here - we could be

staring at Zerzura.

Other readers look over at this unseemly skirmish.

MADOX

So - on Thursday you don't trust

Bell's map - Bell was a fool, Bell

couldn't draw a map, but on Friday

he's suddenly infallible?

MADOX

And where are the Expedition Maps?

ALMASY

In my room.

MADOX

Those maps belong to His Majesty's

Government.  They're confidential.

They shouldn't be left lying around

for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have

sight of.

ALMASY

What's the matter with you?

MADOX

Don't be so bloody naive.  You know

there's a war breaking out.

(he tosses a slip of paper onto

This arrived this morning.  By order

of the British Government - all

International Expeditions to be

aborted by May 1939.

ALMASY

Why do they care about our maps?

MADOX

What do we find in the desert?  Arrow

heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the

desert, you own North Africa.

ALMASY

(contemptuous)

Own the desert.

ALMASY

That place at the base of a woman's

throat?  You know - the hollow - here -

does that have an official name?

MADOX

For God's sake, man - pull

yourself together.

SOLDIER

Beggin your pardon, miss, but have

you got a lighter?

SOLDIER

(leering)

I love Ginger, she's a foxy girl, ain't she?

KATHARINE

Fuck off.

SOLDIER

What?

KATHARINE

You heard me.

ALMASY

Sorry.

KATHARINE

I can't do this, I can't do this any more.

Finally, Katharine gets up.

KATHARINE

I'd better get back.

(she keeps him away with a hand)

Say goodbye here.

ALMASY

I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm

agreeing, because I'm not.

KATHARINE

I just know - any minute he'll find out,

we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it

will ill him.

ALMASY

Don't go over it again, please.

ALMASY

Katharine -

He walks towards her, his smile awful.

ALMASY

I just wanted you to know.

I'm not missing you yet.

KATHARINE

You will.  You will.

THE PATIENT

I'm still here.

HANA

You'd better be.

THE PATIENT

Don't depend on it.  Will you?

That little bit of air, each day

there's less of it, which is al right,

which is quite all right.

THE PATIENT

(brightly)

I've been talking to Caravaggio - my

research assistant - there's meant to be

a ghost in the Cloisters.  I can join him!

THE PATIENT

It's the boy.

KIP

Go to the left!  Keep to the left!  There

are mines and trip wires everywhere!

KIP

Get Hardy.  He's on the other side of

town.  In the hills.  Get him to hurry.

HANA

It's okay - I'll help.  Please.

KIP

The mines, the wires, there's a trick.

Some explode if you stretch the wires,

some if you cut them.

HANA

What do I do?

KIP

There's a mine here, but the others are

far enough away, I think at least to

give me a chance.  I have to work out

which one to cut before I fall over.

HANA

So I follow the wires?

KIP

You get Hardy.

HANA

I follow the wires.

KIP

Don't touch them.

HANA

Why would anyone do this?

KIP

I've done this.  I've had to do this.

Then Hana's suddenly tense.

HANA

Give me a second.

KIP

What are you doing?!  Hana!

KIP

What is this business with you and

explosives?  Do you think you're immune?

HANA

I promise you that was the right thing

to do.  He's my good luck.

(she gets the pliers from his belt,

Now cut.  This one.

(she indicates the wire)

I hope we don't die.

KIP

Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.

HANA

I'm not scared.  So many people have

died around me.  But I would be a

shame for us.

(shrugs)

I don't feel like being shy.

KIP

You must get away.  Before I cut.  I'm

not cutting if you're here.

HANA

Actually, you can't cut, can you?

You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.

KIP

No.

HANA

Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.

KIP

Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and

then cut.

THE PATIENT

Hana!  Hana!  Kip!  Hana!

HANA

I'm sorry.  I forgot you'd be worrying.

We're all safe.  It was a mine, but not

the mine.  Nobody's hurt.  I'm sorry.

SOLDIER

And you're definitely traveling with

him of your own free will?

HANA

Yes.

SOLDIER

(clearly disapproving)

Just wanting to be sure.  And he's

taking you to church?

HANA

(deadpan)

Yes.  We're going to a funeral.  A cow has

died.  And in his religion they're sacred.

Kip steers the motorbike into the deserted PIAZZA.

HANA

Kip?

THE PATIENT

There was a general who wore a patch

over a perfectly good eye.  The men

fought harder for him.  Sometimes I

think I could get up and dance.

What's under your bandages?

CARAVAGGIO

Hold the ends.

AICHA

He's waiting for you.

FENELON-BARNES

(barely looking up)

What a bloody flap, eh?  I heard from

Alexandria this morning - apparently

no-one there is accepting British pounds.

And if you pick up a telephone

everybody's practicing their German.

(holds up some gramophone records)

What do you do - do you take these

things?

(then, awkward)

Look, Moose, we need you to stay in

Tobruk.  A bit of a short straw but

the thinking is we'll be back - I mean,

we will be back - but...and in the

interim we need eyes and ears on

the ground.

CARAVAGGIO

We have 30, 000 troops in Tobruk.

What are they going to be doing?

FENELON-BARNES

(continuing to pack)

Giving Rommel a bloody nose. That's

my suggestion.  But did you hear

the BBC last nigh?  Tobruk is of no

strategic importance - makes you wonder.

FENELON-BARNES

Jerry's got our maps you know.  Swines.

Before the war we helped them run about

the desert making maps - and now they

get spies into Cairo using our maps, they'll

get Rommel into Cairo using our maps.

The whole of the desert like a bus route

and we gave it to them.   Any foreigner who

turned up - welcome to the Royal Geographic,

take our maps.  Madox went mad, you know -

you knew Peter Madox? - after he found

out he'd been betrayed by his friend.

Absolutely destroyed the poor sod.  Shot

himself in a church in Dorset.

FENELON-BARNES

I'd like to get that bastard Almasy -

settle the score, eh?  That's my

fantasy - said he, clearing out.

Must have been a spy all along.

MULLER

(in German)

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

MULLER

David Caravaggio.

CARAVAGGIO

No.

MULLER

Petty thief, six months imprisonment

Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.

CARAVAGGIO

(barely with humor)

I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong

man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio

Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both

painters, I think that is confusing you.

MULLER

Is this you?

CARAVAGGIO

I don't know.

MULLER

It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at

British Headquarters - July 41.  And so was

this - August 41.  And this -February 42.

CARAVAGGIO

It's impossible.  I was buying or selling

something.  I've been to Cairo many times.

MULLER

You are a Canadian spy working for

the Allies.  Code-name Moose.

CARAVAGGIO

Could I have a doctor?  I am passing

blood.  I must be bleeding internally.

(to the clerk)

Can you get a doctor?  Look -

(he spits onto the table,

I'm leaking blood.

(he indicates a Guard)

He kicks me.  He kicks me all the time.

CLERK

(in German)

He's asking for a doctor.

MULLER

(to Caravaggio)

You want a doctor?

CARAVAGGIO

Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a

month, I don't know, also my leg was -

MULLER

We don't have a doctor, but we

do have a nurse.

CARAVAGGIO

A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great.

A nurse?  Great.

MULLER

(in German)

Leave it and get the nurse!

MULLER

(snapping)

Why is there so much nose?  I can't

hear myself think!

(turns to Caravaggio)

Look - give me something.  So we can

all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.

(wiping his face)

It's too hot.

CARAVAGGIO

I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife

in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points

at you, you only see trouble.

MULLER

I'll tell you what I'm going to do.  This

is your nurse, by the way.  She's Moslem,

so she'll understand all of this.  What's

the punishment for adultery?  Let's

leave it at that.  You're married and

you were fucking another woman, so

that's - is it the hands that are cut off?

Or is that for stealing?  Does anyone know?

MULLER

Well, you must know.  You were

brought up Libya, yes?

CARAVAGGIO

Don't cut me.

MULLER

Or was it Toronto?

CARAVAGGIO

(ashen)

Don't cut me.  Come on.

MULLER

Ten fingers.  How about this?  You

give me a name for every finger -

doesn't matter who.  I get something,

you keep something.  I'm trying to be

reasonable.  Fenelon-Barnes, we could

call that two names.

(pauses, suddenly puzzled)

Are thumbs fingers?

(in GERMAN to the others)

Is a thumb a finger?

MULLER

I get no help from these people.

CLERK

(in German)

The telephone -

MULLER

(in German)

What are you doing?

STENOGRAPHER

(awkward, in German)

That Geneva Convention.  I'm -

Muller peremptorily rips out the paper, throws it on the floor.

CARAVAGGIO

You can't do that!  Hey - come on!

MULLER

Go!  Hey!  Go!

CARAVAGGIO

Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.

CARAVAGGIO

(as she prepares to cut)

Listen, I'll give you a name.  What

name did you say?  I knew them!

I promise.  Please - please!

MULLER

Cut the other thumb.

MULLER

This one!  Come on!

CARAVAGGIO

The man who took my thumbs, I found

him eventually - he's dead.  The man who

took my photograph, I found him too -

that took me a year.  He's dead.  Another

man took that man across the desert to

Cairo.  Now I intend to find him.

ALMASY

I believe I'm rather late.

MADOX

(ignoring the drama of this entrance)

Good, we're all here?  A toast,

to the International Sand club -

may it soon resurface.

THE OTHERS

The International Sand Club!

ALMASY

(raising his glass)

Misfits, buggers, fascists, and

paedophiles.  God bless us every one.

ALMASY

Oops!  Mustn't say International.

Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty!

Die Fuhrer!  Il Duce.

CLIFTON

Sorry, what's your point?

ALMASY

(ignoring the remark)

And the people here don't want us.

Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are

desperate to get rid of the Colonials...

(to an embarrassed Fouad)

- isn't that right?  Their best people

get down on hands and knees

begging to be spared a knighthood.

(to his host, Sir Hampton)

Isn't that right?

ALMASY

What's my point?

(standing up)

Oh!  I've invented a new dance - the

Bosphorus Hug.  Anybody up to it?

Madox?  D'Ag?  Come on D'Aggers.

D'AGOSTINO

Let's eat first.  Sit down.

ALMASY

...We'll bathe at Brighton, the fish

we'll frighten when we're in.  your

bathing suit so thin will make the

shellfish grin, fin to fin. --  Those

were the words - actually - before

they were cleaned up.  Could be a

song for you, Mrs. Clifton -

(a perfect English accent)

#NAME?

MADOX

Look, either shut up, or go home.

ALMASY

(darkly)

Absolutely right, shut up.  Lashings of

apologies all round.

ALMASY

Why did you hold his collar?

KATHARINE

What?

ALMASY

(mimicking her inflection)

What?  What?  That boy, that little boy,

you were holding his collar, gripping

his collar, what for?

KATHARINE

Would you let me pass?

ALMASY

Is he next?  Do you drag him into your

little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?

KATHARINE

Don't do this.

ALMASY

I've watched you - on verandahs, at

Garden Parties, at the Races - how

can you stand there?  How can you

ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?

KATHARINE

You know why?

ALMASY

Dance with me.

KATHARINE

No.

ALMASY

Dance with me.  I want to touch you.

I want the things which are mine.

Which belong to me.

KATHARINE

Do you think you're the only one who

feels anything?  Is that what you think?

THE PATIENT

Why don't you go?

(wiping his eyes)

You should sleep.

HANA

Would you like me to?

KIP (O/S)

Hana.

HANA

(happy )

Kip.

HARDY

I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.

HANA

He's sleeping.

HARDY

Only we have to go to work.

HANA

I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?

HARDY

A bomb.  At the Viaduct.

HANA

Does he have to go?

HARDY

Pardon me?

HANA

What if you couldn't find him...?

(Hardy's bewildered)

Sergeant, not today, please.

Not this morning.

KIP

What's happening?  Am I needed?

HARDY

I'm afraid so, sir.

HANA

Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love

a coward, I can't love another dead man.

KIP

This is what I do.  I do this every day.

KIP

Serial number - KK-1P2600.

KIP

Hardy!  Hardy!  What's happening?!

HARDY

Corporal!?  Dade!!

DADE

Tanks, sir.  Don't know what it's about.

God only knows.

HARDY

(incredulous)

What is this - a bloody carnival?

Stop them!

HARDY

You've got to cut, sir, that frost

won't last.

KIP

Go away.

HARDY

Yessir.

KIP

This is making me incredibly angry.

KIP

Kiss me.

HARDY

Get a blanket!

(not getting attention)

Dade!  Get the Lieutenant a blanket.

DADE

It's over, Sarge.  It's over.  Jerry's surrendered.

(to Kip)

Sir, congratulations!

KIP

Congratulations.

HANA

Kip!

A VICTORY CELEBRATION PARTY.

HANA

Kip - come and dance with me

KIP

(a sly wobble of the head)

Yes.  Later.

CARAVAGGIO

Have a drink.

THE PATIENT

I've had a drink.  Fatal.

CARAVAGGIO

Well, anything you do is likely

to be fatal, so you know -

THE PATIENT

Very true!

THE PATIENT

Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?

HANA

Never heard of it.

THE PATIENT

That was a dance we invented at

the International Sand Club.

CARAVAGGIO

(cryptic)

What?  You and Madox?  Or you

and Katharine Clifton?

THE PATIENT

(a small laugh)

What?

HANA

(anxious, of the noise)

What was that?

Kip's motorbike skids into the tiny PIAZZA.

SPALDING

Booby trap.  They was running up the

Union Jack, sir, up off that statue -

It just went off.

DADE

Should have been me.  It was my idea

but Sergeant Hardy climbed up, sir,

him and Blackler.

SPALDING

Sir - you don't want to look.

KIP

Who's that girl?

DADE

His fiancee, sir.

KIP

(astonished)

Hardy's?

DADE

Kept it a bit dark.

KIP

I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! -

the Patient, Hardy: they're

everything that's good about England.

I couldn't even say what that was.

We didn't exchange two personal words,

and we've been together through some

terrible things, some -

(incredulous)

he was engaged to a girl in the village! -

I mean -

(looks at Hana)

and us - he never once... He didn't

ask me if I could spin the ball at

cricket or the kamasutra or -

I don't even know what I'm

talking about.

HANA

You loved him.

HANA

If one night I didn't come to the tent,

what would you do?

KIP

I try not to expect you.

HANA

But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?

KIP

Then I'd think there must be a reason.

HANA

You wouldn't come to find me?

(Kip shrugs)

That makes me never want to come here.

HANA

Then I tell myself he spends all

day searching, in the night he

wants to be found.

MADOX

Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria

is still out, which I'm looking forward

to.  She says Dorset is gripped with

Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I

should have thought, still...

ALMASY

Right.

MADOX

Bermann thinks he'll be interned,

poor fellow.  I'm going to do what

I can, but...  And D'Ag turns out

to be a great admirer of Mussolini.

So now you can say I told you so.

ALMASY

I told you so.

MADOX

We didn't care about countries.

Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians,

Germans.  None of that mattered,

did it?  It was something finer than that.

ALMASY

Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass.

I'll look after it for you.

MADOX

(shrugging this off)

When's Clifton picking you up?

ALMASY

Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry.

I'll be ready.

MADOX

I'll leave the plane in the hangar at

Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it...hard to

know how long one's talking about.  We

might all be back in a month or two.

MADOX

I have to teach myself not to read

too much into everything.  Comes of

too long having to read so much into

hardly anything at all.

ALMASY

Goodbye, my friend.

MADOX

May God make safety your companion.

ALMASY

(a tradition)

There is no God.

(smiles)

But I hope someone looks after you.

MADOX

In case you're still wondering - this

is called the supasternal notch.

MADOX

Come and visit us in Dorset.  When

all this nonsense is over.

(then shrugs)

You'll never come to Dorset.

HANA

Sometimes I need you to find me.

THE PATIENT

Hana tells me you're leaving.

CARAVAGGIO

(preparing the injection)

There are going to be trials, they

want me to interpret, don't they

know I'm allergic to courtrooms?

THE PATIENT

We shall miss you.

CARAVAGGIO

So, I come across the Hospital Convoy

(holds up the syringe)

I was looking for this stuff, and some

nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me

about you and Hana, hiding in a

monastery, in purdah, whatever it is -

retreat -

(he administers his own injection,

how you'd come in from the Desert

and you were burned and you didn't

know your name but you knew the

words to every song there was and

you had one possession -

(picks it up)

#NAME?

full of letters and cuttings, and then

I knew it must be you.

THE PATIENT

Me?

CARAVAGGIO

I'd seen you writing in that book.

At the Embassy in Cairo, when I

had thumbs and you had a face.

And a name.

THE PATIENT

I see.

CARAVAGGIO

Before you went over to the Germans,

before you got Rommel's spy across the

desert and inside British headquarters.

He took some pretty good photographs -

I saw mine in that torture room in

Tobruk, so they made an impression.

THE PATIENT

And you thought you'd come and

settle the score?

CARAVAGGIO

You were the only man who knew

the desert well enough, the only

man who would cross seventeen

hundred miles of nothing.

THE PATIENT

I had to get back to the desert. I made a

promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.

CARAVAGGIO

What did you say?

THE PATIENT

The rest meant nothing to me.

CARAVAGGIO

There was a result to what you did.

It wasn't just another expedition.

(holds up hands)

It did this.  If the British hadn't

unearthed your nosey photographer

in Cairo thousands of people could

have died.

THE PATIENT

Thousands of people did die, just

different people.

CARAVAGGIO

But you were among the British, they

were your friends - why betray them?

THE PATIENT

(a bitter laugh)

Is that what you thought?  That I

betrayed the British?  The British

betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.

ALMASY

Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine -

what are you doing here?

KATHARINE

(eyes rolling, an incredible weariness)

I can't move.  I can't get out.

ALMASY

Why did he bring you?

KATHARINE

A surprise, he said.

KATHARINE

Poor Geoffrey.  He knew.  He must

have known all the time.  He was

shouting - I love you, Katharine,

I love you so much.  Is he badly hurt?

His neck is odd.

KATHARINE

Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.

ALMASY

We've got to get you out of here.

KATHARINE

It hurts too much.

ALMASY

(can't bear to hurt her)

I know, darling, I'm sorry.

KATHARINE

(whispering)

Why did you hate me?

ALMASY

What?

KATHARINE

Don't you know you drove everybody mad?

ALMASY

Don't talk.

KATHARINE

(gasping)

You speak so many bloody languages

and you never want to talk.

ALMASY

(overwhelmed)

You're wearing the thimble.

KATHARINE

Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it.

I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.

KATHARINE

It's so cold.

ALMASY

I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire.

I'll be back.

KATHARINE

(panicking suddenly)

Don't leave me!

ALMASY

I'm just going to find things for the fire.

KATHARINE

Shall we be all right?

ALMASY

Yes.  Absolutely.

KATHARINE

(with a laugh)

Oh dear.

ALMASY

(as he works)

Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken

your ankle and I'm going to have to try

and bind it.  I think your wrist might be

broken, too - and some ribs, which is

why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm

going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given

all the traffic in the desert these days

I should bump into one army or another

before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes

and his camel.  And then I'll be back

and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.

KATHARINE

Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die

here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert.

I've always had a rather elaborate funeral

in mind, with particular hymns.  Very

English.  And I know exactly where I

want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where

I grew up.  With a view of the sea.  So

promise me you'll come back for you.

ALMASY

I promise I'll come back.  I promise

I'll never leave you.  And there's

plenty of water and food.  You

can have a party.

ALMASY

And a good read.

(of the flashlight battery)

Don't waste it.

KATHARINE

Thank you.

(clouds over)

Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know

he's dead.

ALMASY

I'm sorry, Katharine.

KATHARINE

I know.

ALMASY

Every night I cut out my heart but

in the morning it was full again.

ALMASY

Tell me about your garden.

KATHARINE

(tries to focus)

Our Garden, our garden - not so much

the garden, but the copse alongside it,

wild, a secret way plunging down to the

shore and then nothing but water

between you and France.  The Devil's

Chimney it was called -

(he pulls tight on the binding)

The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.

(he kisses her)

Darling.  My darling.

THE PATIENT'S (O/S)

Seventy miles, north - north west.

I had Madox's compass.  A man can

walk in the desert as fast as a camel.

That's about two and a half miles an hour.

THE PATIENT (O/S)

I stopped at noon and at twilight.

Three days there, I told her, then

three hours back by jeep.  Don't go

anywhere.  I'll be back.

OFFICER

Good morning!

ALMASY

Could I trouble you for some water?

OFFICER

(registering the accented English)

Yes, of course.

(the Corporal has a water bottle,

So, golly, where have you come from?

ALMASY

(gulping the water)

I desperately need a jeep.  There's

been an accident.

OFFICER

I see.

ALMASY

(brain racing)

No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need

a doctor too, to come with me, can I

take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course -

and some morphine and...

(calculating)

Seventy miles - I can be back

here by dusk.

OFFICER

Do you have your papers, sir?

ALMASY

What?

OFFICER

If I could just see some identification.

ALMASY

Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me,

I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a

woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir,

in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a

member of the Royal Geographical

Society.

OFFICER

Right.  And what's your name, sir?

ALMASY

Count Laszlo de Almasy.

OFFICER

Almasy - would you mind just

spelling that for me?  What

nationality would that be?

ALMASY

Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying -

my wife! - is dying seventy miles from

here.  I have been walking for three

days!  I don't want to spell my name,

I want you to give me this jeep!

OFFICER

(writing)

I understand you are agitated -

perhaps you would like to sit down

while I radio back to HQ -

ALMASY

(snapping)

No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody,

just give me the fucking jeep!

ALMASY

(shouting hoarse)

Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me

out of here - there's a woman dying,

there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!

CORPORAL

Shut-up!

ALMASY

Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you,

please listen to me, this is a terrible

mistake.  Just stop, please, and

listen to me.  My wife is dying.

CORPORAL

Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen

to another word from you I'll

give you a fucking good hiding.

ALMASY

Fritz?  What are you talking about?

Who's Fritz?

CORPORAL

That's your name innit?  Count

Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck?

What's that supposed to be then, Irish?

ALMASY

Let me out, let me out, let me out -

Katharine!  Katharine!

ALMASY

Excuse me.

(the Soldier looks up)

I also need to use the lavatory.

SOLDIER

You'll have to wait.

(calls up the corridor)

Sarge!  Jerry wants to use the lav -

says it's urgent.

ALMASY

Where are we going, please?

SOLDIER

To the coast.  Benghazi.  Soon be there.

Get a boat home.  You'll be all right.

SERGEANT

What's up?

ALMASY

Cramps.  It's urgent.

SERGEANT

Go on then - you take him.

THE PATIENT

So yes.  She died because of me.

Because I loved her.  Because I

had the wrong name.

Hana enters, goes up, hugs him from behind.

HANA

What are you up to?

KIP

That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon -

Zamzammah - remember?  That was

made out of the metal of ordinary things.

I want to make an ordinary thing

out of guns.

KIP

When I went to England I was amazed at

what went on, the waste - I'd been taught

to re-use everything, the dung from a cow

to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a

typewriter - India could live for a

hundred years on what I saw thrown away.

HANA

I should go to the house, get breakfast.

KIP

The lamp was burning all night in his

room.  Caravaggio was there with him.

KIP

This is hot!

HANA

(teasing him)

Nya-nya-nya!

CARAVAGGIO

And did you never see Katharine?  You

never got back to the Cave?

THE PATIENT

Yes, I got back there finally to keep

my promise.  To come back for her.

And then of course I couldn't... I

couldn't even do that properly.

CARAVAGGIO

You get to the morning and the

poison leaks away, doesn't it?

Black nights, fucking black nights,

when you want to howl like a dog.

I thought I would kill you.  You

killed my friends, you ruined my

hands.  But the girl was always

here, like some Guardian Angel.

THE PATIENT

You can't kill me.  I died years ago.

CARAVAGGIO

No, now I can't kill you.

CARAVAGGIO

Kip - what are - ?

KIP

Stay out of this.

THE PATIENT

Kip?

KIP

I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother

always said I was a fool.  Never trust the

British, he said: the deal-makers, the

map-makers; never shake hands with them.

THE PATIENT

What are you talking about?

KIP

What have I been doing all this time?

Do you know how many mines I've seen? -

more mines than there are soldiers, more -

how many mines we've put in the ground

ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped

out of the sky.  And now this.

CARAVAGGIO

Kip, listen -

KIP

I said keep out of this!

KIP

Can you hear?  Can you hear what they're

celebrating?  I listened to you, Uncle.

Sitting at your feet - always sitting at

somebody's feet - trying to learn.  The

right way to hold a teacup, otherwise

you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie -

as if everything can be explained in

terms of a cricket bat and an accent.

CARAVAGGIO

Kip -

KIP

Kip! - it's not even my name because

you can't say it.  Kirpal Singh Bhuller

is my name.

CARAVAGGIO

Well, then ask him his name!

HANA

(getting in between Kip and the Patient)

What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening?

Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.

KIP

They're excited!  They're happy about

destroying a whole city.  Would they

do that to a White Man's City?  Never!

THE PATIENT

(pulling off the earphones)

Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.

CARAVAGGIO

Kip, listen, he lost everything because

he wasn't English - Jesus! - shoot me,

I'm more English than he is!

HANA

Kip.  Kip.  It's me.

(no response)

Why?  It's another bomb.  However

big, what's the difference?  There've

been so many bombs.  What about

Coventry?  What about Dresden?

Where were those cities?

(no response)

I don't understand.  Let me come in.

KIP

Will you come with me?

HANA

Of course.  When?

KIP

I mean home.  India.

HANA

Kip... I -

KIP

(interrupting this)

I know - here I am always a brown man,

there you would be always a white woman.

HANA

Is that what you think?  Is that what

you think I think?

KIP

It's what I've learned.

HANA

I'm thinking about your heart, not

your skin.  And how to reach it.  And

that I don't think I can.  A bomb

has ruined us, just not the bomb

I thought would ruin us.

HANA

I've clung to you.  I've clung to you.

Kip.  Life  a raft.

KIP

(clinging to her)

Then come with me.

HANA

I'll always go back to that church.

Look at my painting.

KIP

I'll always go back to that church.

HANA

So one day we'll meet.

THE PATIENT

Thank you.  Thank you.

THE PATIENT

Read to me, will you?  Read me to sleep.

ALMASY

Katharine, my darling.

ALMASY

I'm so tired.

HANA

My darling, I'm waiting for you - how

long is a day in the dark, or a week?

KATHARINE (O/S)

...the fire is gone now, and I'm

horribly cold.  I really ought to

drag myself outside but then

there would be the sun...

KATHARINE (O/S)

I'm afraid I waste the light on the

paintings and on writing these words...

KATHARINE (O/S)

We die, we die rich with lovers and

tribes, tastes we have swallowed...

CARAVAGGIO

Hana!  Come on!

KATHARINE (O/S)

...bodies we have entered and swum up

like rivers, fears we have hidden in

like this wretched cave...

KATHARINE (O/S)

...I want all this marked on my body.

We are the real countries, not the

boundaries drawn on maps with the

names of powerful men...

CARAVAGGIO

Hana - this is Gioia.

HANA

Buon' giorno.

CARAVAGGIO

She can take you as far as Florence.

HANA

I can get in the back.

KATHARINE (O/S)

...I know you will come and carry me

out into the palace of winds, the rumors

of water... That's all I've wanted -

to walk in such a place with you, with

friends, on earth without maps.

KATHARINE (O/S)

The lamp's gone out and I'm writing

in the darkness...
