RECEPTIONIST

Oh, hi.

OLD WOMAN

(apologetically)

Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought

I'd see --

RECEPTIONIST

I think he's in a conference.

Unfortunately.  I'm really sorry.

OLD WOMAN

Would you just try him?  You never know.

As long as I'm here.  You never know.

RECEPTIONIST

Of course.  Please have a seat.

RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)

(quietly into headset)

It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just

-- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's

old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.

(to old woman)

I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now.

It's a crazy time of year for us.

OLD WOMAN

This book -- It's essential that people

read it because --

(gravely, patting the

manuscript)

-- It's the truth.  And only I know it.

RECEPTIONIST

(nodding sympathetically)

Maybe after the holidays then.

MARY

May I help you?

CLEMENTINE

(approaching reception area)

Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr.

Mierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski.

MARY

Yes, please have a seat.  He'll be right

with you.

MIERZWIAK (O.S.)

Yes?

MARY

Howard, your one o'clock.

MIERZWIAK

(not looking up)

Thanks, Mary.  You can bring her in.

MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)

(looking up)

Mary...

MARY

(turning back)

Yes?

MIERZWIAK

Order me a pastrami for after?

MARY

Cole slaw, ice tea?

MIERZWIAK

(nodding)

Thanks.

MARY

Welcome, Howard.

STAN

Boo.

MARY

Hi.

STAN

Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.

MARY

(reprimanding whisper)

Stan... c'mon...

STAN

Sorry.  I just --

MARY

(somewhat guiltilly)

It's just...y'know... I mean...

STAN

I know.  Anyway --

MARY

Anyway, I've got to do my tap

dance here.

STAN

See you later, alligator.

MARY

'kay.

STAN

Hey, if you're ordering lunch for

Mierzwiak, would you --

MARY

I better do this, Stan.

MARY (CONT'D)

Ms. Kruczynski?

CLEMENTINE (O.S.)

Hi.

MARY

(professionally courteous)

How are you today?

CLEMENTINE

Okay, I guess.

MARY

(at Mierzwiak's office)

Here we are.

MIERZWIAK

Ms. Kruczynski, please come in.

MIERZWIAK

How are you today?

CLEMENTINE

Okay, I guess.

MIERZWIAK

(nodding sympathetically)

Well, why don't you tell me what's going

on?  Do you mind if I turn this on?

CLEMENTINE

I don't care.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Well, I've been having a bad time of it

with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

MIERZWIAK

You guess he's your boyfriend?  Or you

guess you're having a bad time with hm?

CLEMENTINE

What?  No.  I don't like the term

boyfriend.  It's so gay.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Maybe gay isn't the right word.  But,

anyway, it's been rough with him...

whatever the fuck he is.  Heheh.  My

significant other... heh heh.  And I

guess on a certain level, I want to break

it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like

this constant questioning and re

questioning.  Do I end it?  Should I give

it more time?  I'm not happy, but what do

I expect?  Relationships require work.

You know the drill.  The thing that I

keep coming back to is, I'm not getting

any younger, I want to have a baby... at

some point... maybe... right?  So then I

think I should settle -- which is not

necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's

a good guy.  It's not really settling.

Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of

movies, y'know?  That I have some

completely unrealistic notion of what a

relationship can be.  But then I think,

no, this is what I really want, so I

should allow myself the freedom to go out

and fucking find it.  You know?  Agreed?

But then I think he is a good guy and...

It's complicated.  Y'know?

MIERZWIAK

I think I know. I think we can help.  Why

don't you start by telling me about your

relationship.  Everything you can think

of.  Everything about him.  Everything

about you.  And we'll take it from there.

CLEMENTINE

Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --

JOEL

Hi, Cindy.  Joel.  Listen, I'm not

feeling well this morning.  No.  Food

poisoning, I think.  Sorry it took me so

long to call in, but I've been vomiting.

JOEL

January 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work

and took the train out to Montauk.

(thinks)

It's cold.

(thinks some more)

The sky is gray.

(thinks some more)

I don't know what else to say.  Nothing

happens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi

last night.  We had sex.  It was weird to

fall into our old familiar sex life so

easily.  Like no time has passed.  After

two years apart suddenly we're talking

about getting together again.  I guess

that's good.

JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

If I'm constitutionally incapable of

making eye-contact with a woman I don't

know.  I guess I'd better get back to

Naomi.

WAITRESS

Coffee?

CLEMENTINE

God, yes.  You've saved my life!

WAITRESS

You know what you want yet?

CLEMENTINE

(laughing)

Ain't that the question of the century.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?

WAITRESS

Yeah.  We're having a run on it.

CLEMENTINE

(calling)

And some cream, please.

CLEMENTINE

(calling over the rumble)

Hi!

JOEL

I'm sorry.

CLEMENTINE

Why?

JOEL

Why what?

CLEMENTINE

Why are you sorry?  I just said hi.

JOEL

No, I didn't know if you were talking to

me, so...

CLEMENTINE

Really?

JOEL

(embarrassed)

Well, I didn't want to assume.

CLEMENTINE

Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the

leap and assume someone is talking to you

in an otherwise empty car.

JOEL

Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi.

CLEMENTINE

It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't

have to scream.  Not that I don't need to

scream sometimes, believe me.

(pause)

But I don't want to bug you if you're

trying to write or something.

JOEL

No, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really

think of much to say probably.

CLEMENTINE

Oh.  So...

JOEL

I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down

here.  I didn't mean to --

CLEMENTINE

No, I don't want to bug you if you're

trying to --

JOEL

It's okay, really.

CLEMENTINE

Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.

I have a long trip ahead of me.

(sits across aisle from Joel)

How far are you going?  On the train, I

mean, of course.

JOEL

Rockville Center.

CLEMENTINE

Get out!  Me too!  What are the odds?

JOEL

The weirder part is I think actually I

recognize you.  I thought that earlier in

the diner.  That's why I was looking at

you.  You work at Borders, right?

CLEMENTINE

Ucch, really?  You're kidding.  God.

Bizarre small world, huh?  Yeah, that's

me: book slave there for, like, five

years now.

JOEL

Really?  Because --

CLEMENTINE

Jesus, is it five years?  I gotta quit

right now.

JOEL

-- because I go there all the time.  I

don't think I ever saw you before.

CLEMENTINE

Well, I'm there.  I hide in the back as

much as is humanly possible.  You have a

cell phone?  I need to quit right this

minute.  I'll call in dead.

JOEL

I don't have one.

CLEMENTINE

I'll go on the dole.  Like my daddy

before me.

JOEL

I noticed your hair.  I guess it made an

impression on me, that's why I was pretty

sure I recognized you.

CLEMENTINE

Ah, the hair.

(pulls a strand in front of her

eyes, studies it)

Blue, right?  It's called Blue Ruin.  The

color.  Snappy name, huh?

JOEL

I like it.

CLEMENTINE

Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were

wondering.

JOEL

Yeah.  Tom Waits says it in --

CLEMENTINE

Exactly!  Tom Waits.  Which song?

JOEL

I can't remember.

CLEMENTINE

Anyway, this company makes a whole line

of colors with equally snappy names.  Red

Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.

That'd be a job, coming up with those

names.  How do you get a job like that?

That's what I'll do.  Fuck the dole.

JOEL

I don't really know how --

CLEMENTINE

Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.

JOEL

You think that could possibly be a full

time job?  How many hair colors could

there be?

CLEMENTINE

(pissy)

Someone's got that job.

(excited)

Agent Orange!  I came up with that one.

Anyway, there are endless color

possibilities and I'd be great at it.

JOEL

I'm sure you would.

CLEMENTINE

My writing career!  Your hair written by

Clementine Kruczynski.

(thought)

The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.

JOEL

You sure?  That doesn't sound --

CLEMENTINE

I think.  Anyway, I've tried all their

colors.  More than once.  I'm getting too

old for this.  But it keeps me from

having to develop an actual personality.

I apply my personality in a paste.  You?

JOEL

Oh, I doubt that's the case.

CLEMENTINE

Well, you don't know me, so... you don't

know, do you?

JOEL

Sorry.  I was just trying to be nice.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah, I got it.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

My name's Clementine, by the way.

JOEL

I'm Joel.

CLEMENTINE

No jokes about my name?  Oh, you wouldn't

do that; you're trying to be nice.

JOEL

I don't know any jokes about your name.

CLEMENTINE

Huckleberry Hound?

JOEL

I don't know what that means.

CLEMENTINE

Huckleberry Hound!  What, are you nuts?

JOEL

I'm nut nuts.

CLEMENTINE

(singing)

Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my

darlin' Clementine?  No?

JOEL

Sorry.  It's a pretty name, though.  It

means "merciful", right?

CLEMENTINE

(impressed)

Yeah.  Although it hardly fits.  I'm a

vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

JOEL

See, I wouldn't think that about you.

CLEMENTINE

(pissy)

Why wouldn't you think that about me?

JOEL

Oh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't

know.  I was... You seemed nice, so --

CLEMENTINE

Now I'm nice?  Don't you know any other

adjectives?  There's careless and snotty

and overbearing and argumentative...

mumpish.

JOEL

Well, anyway... Sorry.

CLEMENTINE

I just don't think "nice" is a

particularly interesting thing to be.

CONDUCTOR

Tickets.

CLEMENTINE

What is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an

adjective?  I guess it can be an adverb,

sort of.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

It doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is

pandering.  Cowardly.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

And life is more interesting than that.

Or should be.  Jesus God, I hope it is...

someday.

(to conductor)

I know it's here.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

I don't need nice.  I don't need myself

to be it and I don't need anyone else to

be it at me.

JOEL

Okay.

CLEMENTINE

Shit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Damn it.  DAMN IT!

(there it is)

Oh.  Here.

CONDUCTOR

Next stop Southampton.

CLEMENTINE

Joel?  It's Joel, right?

JOEL

Yes?

CLEMENTINE

I'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it

yelling?  I can't really tell.  Whatever,

I'm a little out of sorts today.

JOEL

That's okay.

CLEMENTINE

(stares out window)

My embarrassing admission is I really

like that you're nice.  Right now,

anyway.  I can't tell from one moment to

the next what I'm going to like.  But

right now I'm glad you said, "that's

okay" to me.  That was nice of you.

JOEL

It's no problem.  Anyway, I have some

stuff I need to --

CLEMENTINE

Oh, okay.  Well, sure, I'll just...

(stands, throws bag over

shoulder)

Take care, then.

JOEL

(pulling journal from

briefcase)

Probably see you at the book store.

CLEMENTINE

(heading toward other end of

car)

Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.

JOEL

Hi.  I could give you a ride if you need.

CLEMENTINE

No, that's okay.  Thanks, though.

JOEL

You're sure?  It's cold.

CLEMENTINE

I don't want to take you out of your way.

JOEL

It's okay.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah?

JOEL

Where do you live?

CLEMENTINE

You're not a stalker or anything, right?

JOEL

Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were,

but no.

CLEMENTINE

You can't be too careful.  I've been

stalked.  I've been told I'm highly

stalkable.  I don't need that.

JOEL

I'm not a stalker.

CLEMENTINE

(beat)

You know Wilmont?

JOEL

Yeah.

CLEMENTINE

Wilmont.  Near the high school.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of

nutso.  I'm not really.

JOEL

It's okay.  I didn't think you were.

CLEMENTINE

So you like bookstores, huh?

JOEL

I like to read.

CLEMENTINE

Me too.  It is Rain Dogs, by the way.

JOEL

Yeah?  I can't remember that album very

well.  I remember liking it.  But --

CLEMENTINE

The song's 9th and Hennepin.  I spent

most of the train ride trying to

remember.  "Till you're full of rag water

and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill

out/Over the side to anyone who'll

listen."  Remember?

JOEL

Sort of, um...

CLEMENTINE

Remember?  "And you take on the dreams of

the ones who have slept there/And I'm

lost in the window/I hide on the

stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in

your hat..."

(starts to cry)

Oh, shit.  I'm so stupid.  Sorry.

JOEL

What?

CLEMENTINE

I'm just a bit of a wreck.  "I sleep in

your hat" makes me cry.

(pointing to a house)

Me.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Thanks very much.  That was very nice of

you.

JOEL

Well, I wouldn't want to be --

CLEMENTINE

Oh, geez, I'm full of shit.  I already

told you that.

(pause)

Anyway.  See Ya.

JOEL

Take care.

CLEMENTINE

(turning back)

Hey, do you want to have a drink?  I have

lots of drinks.  And I could --

JOEL

Um --

CLEMENTINE

Never mind.  Sorry, that was stupid.  I'm

embarrassed.  Good night, Joel.

CLEMENTINE

Thanks.  I like it, too.  Been here about

four years.  It's really cheap.  My

downstairs neighbor is old so she's

quiet, which is great.  And the

landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but

great, and I have a little porch in the

back, which is great, because I can read

there, and listen to my crickets and...

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Two blue ruins...

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

You like that?

JOEL

Very much.

CLEMENTINE

This... someone gave that to me, just

like, recently.  I like it, too.  I like

crows.  I think I used to be a crow.

JOEL

Thanks.  That was good, that crow sound.

CLEMENTINE

Do you believe in that stuff?

Reincarnation?

JOEL

I don't know.

CLEMENTINE

Me neither.  Oh, there's an inscription

on the back.

(takes it off the wall, reads:)

The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust

of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my

heart/A change of mood/And saved some

part/Of a day I rued.

JOEL

Frost?

CLEMENTINE

(impressed)

Yeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost

lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems

strictly grade school to me.  But this

made me cry for some reason.  Maybe

because it is grade school.  Y'know?

JOEL

It's pretty.

CLEMENTINE

I miss grade school.  I don't know why

I'm calling it grade school all of a

sudden.  When I went we called it

elementary school.  But I like grade

school better.  Sounds like something

someone from the forties would call it.

I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore

hats.  Anyway, cheers!

JOEL

Cheers.

CLEMENTINE

God, that feels so fucking good.  Take

yours off.

JOEL

I'm fine.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Ready for another?

JOEL

No, I'm okay for now.

CLEMENTINE

Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on.

JOEL

What do you want to hear?

CLEMENTINE (O.S.)

You pick it.

JOEL

You just say.  I'm not really --

CLEMENTINE (O.S.)

I don't know!  I can't see them from

here, Joel!  Just pick something good.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Oh, excellent choice.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick

good.

JOEL

Well, I should probably get going.

CLEMENTINE

No, stay.  Just for a little while.

(opens her eyes, brightly)

Refill?

JOEL

No.  I --

CLEMENTINE

I know a man who needs a refill.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)

God bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where

would I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary,

and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think

about that.

JOEL

Thanks.

CLEMENTINE

Drink up, young man.  It'll make the

whole seduction part less repugnant.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

I'm just kidding.  C'mon.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.

JOEL

Yeah?

CLEMENTINE

Well, I go to a psychic and she's always

telling me I'm psychic.  She should know.

Do you believe in that stuff?

JOEL

I don't know.

CLEMENTINE

Me neither.  But sometimes I have

premonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe

that's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know,

you think something and then it happens,

or you think a word and then someone says

it?  Y'know?

JOEL

Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard to know.

CLEMENTINE

Exactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my

feeling about it.  It's hard to know.

Like, okay, but how many times do I think

something and it doesn't happen?  That's

what you're saying, right?  You forget

about those times.  Right?

JOEL

Yeah, I guess.

CLEMENTINE

(dreamy beat)

But I think I am.  I like to think I am.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

It's helpful to think there's some order

to things.  You're kind of closed

mouthed, aren't you?

JOEL

Sorry.  My life isn't that interesting.

I go to work.  I go home.  I don't know

what to say.

CLEMENTINE

Oh.

(considers this)

Does that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm

always anxious thinking I'm not living my

life to the fullest, y'know?  Taking

advantage of every possibility?  Just

making sure that I'm not wasting one

second of the little time I have.

JOEL

I think about that.

CLEMENTINE

You're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled

at you before about it.  God, I'm an

idiot.

JOEL

I do have a tendency to use that word too

much.

CLEMENTINE

I like you.  That's the thing about my

psychic thing.  I think that's my

greatest psychic power, that I get a

sense about people.  My problem is I

never trust it.  But I get it.  And with

you I get that you're a really good guy.

JOEL

Thanks.

CLEMENTINE

And, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I

can tell.  There's a lot of stuff going

on in your brain.  I can tell.  My

goal... can I tell you my goal?

JOEL

Yeah.

CLEMENTINE

(ala Paul Simon)

What's the goal, Joel?

(laughs)

My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow

through me?  Do you know what I mean?

It's like, there's all these emotions and

ideas and they come quick and they change

and they leave and they come back in a

different form and I think we're all

taught we should be consistent.  Y'know?

You love someone -- that's it.  Forever.

You choose to do something with your life

-- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a

sign of maturity to stick with that and

see things through.  And my feeling is

that's how you die, because you stop

listening to what is true, and what is

true is constantly changing.  You know?

JOEL

Yeah.  I think so.  It's hard to --

CLEMENTINE

Like I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't

need any more reason to do it.  Who knows

what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

JOEL

Yeah.

CLEMENTINE

You're very nice.  God, I have to stop

saying that.  You're nervous around me,

huh?

JOEL

No.

CLEMENTINE

I'm nervous.  You don't need to be

nervous around me, though.  I like you.

Do you think I'm repulsively fat?

JOEL

No, not at all.

CLEMENTINE

I don't either.  I used to.  But I'm

through with that.  Y'know, if I don't

love my body, then I'm just lost.  You

know?

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

With all the wrinkles and scars and the

general falling apart that's coming

'round the bend.

(beat)

So, I've been seeing this guy...

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

(off his reaction)

Well, for the last week, anyway!  He's

kind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but

he's really stuck on me, which is

flattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And

he's, like, a dope, but he says these

smart and moving things sometimes, out of

nowhere, that just break my heart.  He's

the one who gave me that crow photograph.

JOEL

Oh, yeah.

CLEMENTINE

That made me cry.  But, anyway, we went

up to Boston, because I had this urge to

lie on my back on the Charles River.  It

gets frozen this time of year.

JOEL

That's scary sounding.

CLEMENTINE

Exactly!  I used to do it in college and

I had this urge to go do it again, so I

got Patrick and we drove all night to get

there and he was sweet and said nice

things to me, but I was really

disappointment to be there with him.

Y'know?  And that's where psychic stuff

comes in.  Like, it just isn't right with

him.  Y'know?

JOEL

I think so.

CLEMENTINE

I don't believe in that soulmate crap

anymore, but... he says so many great

things.  We like the same writers.  This

writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to.

And he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel,

you should come up to the Charles with me

sometime.

JOEL

Okay.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah?  Oh, great!

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic --

night picnics are different -- and --

JOEL

(shy)

Sounds good.  But right now I should go.

CLEMENTINE

(pause)

You should stay.

JOEL

I have to get up early in the morning

tomorrow, so...

CLEMENTINE

(beat)

Okay.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

I would like you to call me.  Would you

do that?  I would like that.

JOEL

Yes.

JOEL (CONT'D)

I don't think your personality comes out

of a tube.  I think the hair is just... a

pretty topping.

JOEL (CONT'D)

(shyly formal)

So, I enjoyed meeting you.

CLEMENTINE

You'll call me, right?

JOEL

Yeah.

CLEMENTINE

When?

JOEL

Tomorrow?

CLEMENTINE

Tonight.  Just to test out the phone

lines and all.

JOEL

Okay.

VOICE-OVER

Them.

JOEL

It was snowing.

VOICE-OVER

There are two of them.  Couldn't make

them out.  The orange glow of a

cigarette.

JOEL

The driver waved.  So casual, friendly.

VOICE-OVER

I'm like a joke to them.

VOICE-OVER

I guess they figure they can act like

they want.  They don't have to worry

about me remembering.

JOEL

I might be making a mistake.

VOICE-OVER

Maybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just

need to learn to live with this.  First

of all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it

happened.  Those who do not remember

history are condemned to repeat it.  Who

said that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure.

But I don't care.  She did it to me.  I

have to rid myself of this.  Fuck her.

JOEL

Fuck you, Clementine.

JOEL (CONT'D)

Pink.

(beat)

There was a number on it.  I remember.

AL 1718?

(beat)

I have to follow through with this.  I

have no choice.

VOICE-OVER

The pill was pink, I remember.  It had

some letters and numbers on it.  What

were they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four

digits.  I don't like taking pills when I

don't know what they are.  I have no

choice.

JOEL (CONT'D)

We're sorry, the number you have

dialed...

(beat)

Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ...

RECORDED VOICE

We're sorry, the number you have dialed

is no longer in service.  If you think

you have reached this recording in error

-

JOEL (CONT'D)

Bye.

JOEL (CONT'D)

It's them.

VOICE-OVER

It's too late.

JOEL (CONT'D)

Fuck.

JOEL

I should maybe talk to you.

VOICE-OVER

Clementine.  I should just maybe talk to

her.

JOEL

I love you and if you knew that... if I

told you what happened...  I'll explain

everything, what we meant to each other.

I'll tell you everything about our time

together.  You'll know everything again

and...

VOICE-OVER

Maybe if I just explain what happened, I

wouldn't have to go through this and I

could tell you everything and it would be

like you knew and we could rebuild and we

could be happy again and...

JOEL

Clementine.

VOICE-OVER

That's your look for me.

PATRICK

I just thought I'd say hi.  I was in the

neighborhood.

CLEMENTINE

You were not.

PATRICK

I was not.

CLEMENTINE

Come over after I'm done here?

PATRICK

I can't.  I want to, but I have to study.

CLEMENTINE

You rat.

PATRICK

I really want to, but tonight's

important.  Test tomorrow.

JOEL

How could she have done this to me?  How

could anyone do this to anyone?

CLEMENTINE

(to Patrick)

You didn't say anything about my hair.

PATRICK

It's so cool.  You're by far the most

sensational person in the room.

CLEMENTINE

In the room?

PATRICK

In the world.

JOEL

What's happening here?

(looks at watch; it's 9:30)

Oh, God!  I have to go home.  They'll be

there soon.

JOEL

Gotta get home.  How could she do this to

me?

How could she not care about what we

meant to each other.  What a fuck!  What

a fucking monster she is!

VOICE-OVER

Oh, God.  I miss her.  I can't believe

she's with that guy now!  I'm never going

to see her again.  I love her so much.

What a fucking monster she is!

JOEL

Them.

MARY

Hello again, Mr. Barish.  Good, you've

got your stuff.

MARY

(not looking back)

How are you today?

(at lab)

Here we are.

MIERZWIAK

Ah, Mr. Barish.  This is Stan.  He'll be

in charge of your procedure tonight.

STAN

Mr. Barish.

JOEL

How exactly is this going to work

tonight?

MIERZWIAK

We'll start with your most recent

memories and go backwards -- There is an

emotional core to each of our memories --

As we eradicate this core, it starts its

degradation process --  By the time you

wake up in the morning, all memories

we've targeted will have withered and

disappeared.  Like a dream upon waking.

JOEL

Is there any sort of risk of brain

damage?

MIERZWIAK

Well, technically, the procedure itself

is brain damage, but on a par with a

night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll

miss.

JOEL

It's happening now!  I'm already in my

brain.

MIERZWIAK

Yes, I suppose you are.

(back in his faded memory

persona)

So, let's get started -- If we want the

procedure underway tonight, we have some

work to do.

STAN

We use the articles you brought to create

a map of Clementine in your brain.

Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to

trace the map and erase.

JOEL

But you're tracing and erasing now.  It's

already started.  I'm home in my bed.

STAN

Very good.

MIERZWIAK

We'll dispose of these mementos when

we're done here.  That way you won't be

confused later by their unexplainable

presence in your home.

STAN

Good.  We're getting healthy read-outs.

STAN'S VOICE

Patrick, do me a favor --

STAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

-- and check the voltage levels, I'm not

wiping as clean as I would like here.

PATRICK

The voltage looks fine.

STAN

Then check the connections.

PATRICK

Does that help?

STAN

Yeah, that looks better.  Thanks.

MIERZWIAK

Ah, your journal.  This will be

invaluable.

STAN

(reading)

December 15th, 2004.  I met someone

tonight.  Oh, Christ:  I don't know what

to do.  Her name is Clementine and she's

amazing.  So alive and spontaneous and

passionate and sensitive.  Things with

Naomi and I have been stagnant for so

long.

STAN'S VOICE

I think we got this one.  Let's push on.

MARY

May I help you?

JOEL

My name is Joel Barish.  I have an

appointment.

MARY

Please have a seat.  Dr. Mierzwiak will

be right with you.

MARY

(without turning)

How are you today?

JOEL

Not great.

MARY

(at Mierzwiak's office)

Here we are.

MIERZWIAK

I'm sorry you saw one of our notification

cards.  You never should have.

JOEL

Well... I did.

MIERZWIAK

We can help you through this.  Why don't

you start now by telling me everything

you can remember about your relationship

with Clementine.

JOEL

(thinks, then:)

It was a mess.  I don't know how it got

this way...

PATRICK'S VOICE

It's kind of a dump, don't you think?

STAN

(uninterested)

It's an apartment.

PATRICK

Not a dump, then, but kind of plain.

Uninspired.  And there's a stale smell.

Sort of stuffy.  I don't know.  Stuffy.

STAN

Patrick, let's just get through this.  We

have a long night ahead of us.

PATRICK

Yeah.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

So who do you think is better-looking, me

or this guy?

MIERZWIAK

So we'll need you to go home and bring in

everything you ever received from

Clementine and anything that might remind

you of her...

JOEL

So then she just stops calling.

VOICE-OVER

I wasn't going to call her.  Not after

the way she was.

JOEL

Any messages, Carmen?

JOEL (CONT'D)

Any messages for me, Carmen.

CARMEN

Nothing, Joel.

VOICE-OVER

It's bullshit.  She's punishing me for

being honest with her.

PHONE MACHINE VOICE

You have no messages.

JOEL

Sorry, Carmen.  Any messages?

VOICE-OVER

That's it.  I'm just gonna--

VOICE-OVER (CONT'D)

I'm gonna tell her I'm through playing

games and --

RECORDED VOICE

The number you have dialed has been

disconnected.

JOEL

Why would she do that?

VAGUE RECORDED VOICE

-- If you think you have reached this

recording in error, please check your

number and dial again.

CARRIE

I don't know, honey.  It's horrible.

JOEL

She's punishing me for being honest.  I

should just go to her house.

ROB

I don't think you should go there, Joel.

JOEL

Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate.

CARRIE

Maybe you need to look at this as a sign

to move on.  Just make a clean break.

JOEL

I don't know.  I'm so... I can't believe

she'd be so goddamn immature!

ROB

Joel, look, the thing is --

CARRIE

(agitated, interrupting)

Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog.

Would you just wait here?  Just a second.

Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her

memory.  Please never mention their relationship to her

again.  Thank you.

Lacuna Ltd.

610 11th Avenue, NY, NY

CARRIE (CONT'D)

You weren't supposed to see that.

JOEL

They can't erase memories.  It's a joke.

It's a nasty Clementine hoax.

CARRIE

Sweetie, we called the company.

VOICE-OVER

Lacuna:  Noun.  A blank, a missing

portion, especially in a manuscript.

CARRIE'S VOICE

You can't tell her, Joel.  They explained

that.  Like waking a sleepwalker.  It

might have a devastating effect.

CARRIE'S VOICE

Think about it: to be told you lived an

existence of which you have no

recollection.

JOEL'S VOICE

But what am I supposed to do?

CARRIE'S VOICE

Move on, sweetie.

JOEL'S VOICE

How can I?  How can I move on when I know

I'm the only one to carry this love we

had?  How do I do that?

MARY

(dead monotone)

Hi, May I help you?

STAN'S VOICE

So, Mary's coming over tonight.

PATRICK

Yeah?

STAN

Just wanted to let you know.

PATRICK

I like Mary.  I like when she comes to

visit.  I just don't think she likes me.

STAN

She likes you okay.

PATRICK

I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend

over, too.  I have a girlfriend now.

STAN

You can if you want.

PATRICK

Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

STAN

(re: memory on monitor)

This one's history.  Moving on...

PATRICK

The thing is ... my situation is a little

weird.  My girlfriend situation.

STAN

Patrick, we need to focus.

CLEMENTINE

Yo ho ho!

JOEL

It's three.

VOICE-OVER

Shit.  The last time I saw you.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing.  I

kinda sorta wrecked your car...

JOEL

I can't believe you wrecked my car.

JOEL

You're driving drunk.  It's pathetic.

CLEMENTINE

...a little.  I was a little tipsy.

Don't call me pathetic.

JOEL

Well it is pathetic.  And fucking

irresponsible.  You could've killed

somebody.

JOEL (CONT'D)

I don't know, maybe you did kill

somebody.

CLEMENTINE

Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody.  It's

just a fucking dent.  You're like some

old lady or something.

VOICE-OVER

Right!  She called me an old lady here,

too!  And I remember, I said...

JOEL (CONT'D)

And what are you like?  A wino?

CLEMENTINE

A wino?  Jesus, Are you from the fifties?

A wino!

(laughs)

Face it, Joel.  You're freaked out

because I was out late without you, and

in your little wormy brain, you're trying

to figure out, did she fuck someone

tonight?

JOEL

No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked

someone tonight.  Isn't that how you get

people to like you?

JOEL (CONT'D)

I'm sorry.  Okay.  I didn't mean that.  I

just... I was just... pissed, I guess.

JOEL

Let me drive you home.

CLEMENTINE

(without turning)

Fuck you, Joel.  Faggot.

JOEL

Look at it out here.  It's falling apart.

I'm erasing you.  And I'm happy.

JOEL (CONT'D)

You did it to me.  I can't believe you

did this to me.  By morning you'll be

gone.  Ha!

PATRICK'S VOICE

See, remember that girl?  The one we did

last week?  The one with the potatoes?

STAN'S VOICE

Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.  Was.

PATRICK

I gotta tell you something.  I kind of

fell in love with her last night.

STAN

She was unconscious, Patrick.

PATRICK

She was beautiful.  So sweet and funky

and voluptuous.  I kind of stole a pair

of her panties, is what.

STAN

Jesus, Patrick!

PATRICK'S VOICE

I know.  It's not like... I mean, they

were clean and all.

STAN'S VOICE

Look, just don't tell me this stuff.  I

don't want to know this shit.

PATRICK'S VOICE

Yeah, okay.

STAN'S VOICE

We have work to do.

PATRICK'S VOICE

Okay, but there's more.

PATRICK'S VOICE (CONT'D)

After we did her, I went to where she

worked and I asked her out.

STAN'S VOICE

Patrick... do you know how unethical...

JOEL

That must be the guy I saw you with.

VOICE-OVER

In the bookstore that night.  The skinny

guy.

CLEMENTINE

How can you watch this crap?

JOEL

Where are you going?

CLEMENTINE

I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.

JOEL

Oh shit.  I remember this.

(to Clementine)

Want to go?

CLEMENTINE

(pissy)

I want to have a baby.

JOEL

Let's talk about it later.

CLEMENTINE

No.  I want to have a baby.  I have to

have a baby.

JOEL

I don't think we're ready.

CLEMENTINE

You're not ready.

JOEL

Clementine, do you really think you could

take care of a kid?

CLEMENTINE

What?!

JOEL

(mumbly)

I don't want to talk about this here.

CLEMENTINE

Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

You can't fucking say something like that

and say you don't want to talk about it!

JOEL

Clem, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have --

CLEMENTINE

(screaming now)

I'd make a fucking good mother!  I love

children!  I'm creative and smart and I'd

make a fucking good mother!

JOEL

Oh, thank God.  It's going.

CLEMENTINE

It's you!  It's you who can't commit to

anything!  You have no idea how lucky you

are I'm interested in you!  I don't even

know why I am!  I should just end it

right here, Joel.  Leave you in the zoo.

Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang

out with!

JOEL

It's going, Clementine.  All the crap and

hurt and disappointment.  It's all being

wiped away.

CLEMENTINE

I'm glad.

JOEL

Me, too.

JOEL

So, um --

CLEMENTINE

(swiveling head toward him)

Would you get me another, Joely?

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Thanky!  Thanky!

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Joel, this is Mark.  He likes my boobs.

He came over special to tell me that.

Isn't that nice.  He doesn't think I'm

fat.

MARK

I didn't know she was with someone, man.

CLEMENTINE

S'okay, Mark.  Joel doesn't like my

boobs.

(stage whisper)

I don't think he likes girls.

JOEL

You're drunk.

CLEMENTINE

You're a whiz kid.  So perceptive, so --

MARY

(coolly)

Oh, hey, Patrick.

PATRICK

Hi, Mary.  How's it going?

STAN

Hey, you.

MARY

It's freezing out.

STAN

You found us okay?

MARY

Yeah.

(re: Joel)

Poor guy.

(looking around)

Have anything to drink?

STAN

We haven't checked.

MARY

Well, allow me to do the honors.  It's

fucking freezing and I need something.

PATRICK

Mary hates me.  I've never been popular

with the ladies.

STAN

Maybe if you stopped stealing their

panties.

PATRICK

(guilty beat)

Okay, There's more, Stan --

MARY

Hey, hey.

MARY (CONT'D)

Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did

you?

PATRICK

Nah, I don't know.

MARY

Blessed are the forgetful, for they get

the better even of their blunders.

MARY (CONT'D)

Nietzsche.  Beyond Good and Evil.  Found

it my Bartletts.

STAN

That's a good one.

MARY

Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard!  It

seems really appropriate.

STAN

(a little sulky)

It's a good one all right.

PATRICK

What's your bartlett's?

STAN

It's a quote book.

MARY

I love quotes.  So did Winston Churchill.

He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's

about Bartlett's.  Isn't that trippy?

PATRICK

(trying to engage)

Yeah.  Cool.

MARY

"The quotations when engraved upon the

memory give you good thoughts."

PATRICK

Very cool.  Trippy.

MARY

I like to read what smart people say.  So

many beautiful, important things.

STAN

Yup.

MARY

Don't you think Howard's like that?

Smart?  Important?

STAN

(beat)

Yup.

PATRICK

Definitely!

MARY

I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.

PATRICK

Definitely.

CLEMENTINE

You don't tell me things, Joel.  I'm an

open book.  I tell you everything.  Every

damn embarrassing thing.  You don't trust

me.

JOEL

No, it isn't that.

CLEMENTINE

I want to know you.

JOEL

I just don't have anything very

interesting about my life.

CLEMENTINE

Joel, you're a liar.

JOEL

How's the chicken?

VOICE-OVER

Is that like us?  Are we just bored with

each other?

CLEMENTINE

Good.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

More?

JOEL

No.  Thanks.

CLEMENTINE

How's the fish?

JOEL

It's good.

PATRICK'S VOICE

Hi, Clementine! -- Why, what's wrong? --

Oh, I'm sorry. -- Well, I'm not sure, I

kind of have to study for my test --

PATRICK

Hold on.  Let me ask my friend.

(covering mouthpiece)

Stan, can I leave for a little while?  My

girlfriend is very --

STAN

Patrick, we're in the middle of --

PATRICK

She's right in the neighborhood.  She's

upset.

MARY

Let him go, Stan.  I can help.

STAN

(sighing, to Patrick)

Go.

PATRICK

(quietly)

Mary hates me.

(into phone)

I'll be right over, Tangerine.

CLEMENTINE

Joely...

JOEL

Yeah, Tangerine?

CLEMENTINE

Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?

JOEL

No.

CLEMENTINE

It's my favorite book.  Since I was a

kid.  It's about these toys.  There's

this part where the skin Horse tells the

rabbit what it means to be real.

(crying)

I can't believe I'm crying already.  He

says, "It takes a long time.  That's why

it doesn't often happen to people who

break easily or have sharp edges, or who

have to be carefully kept.  Generally by

the time you are Real, most of your hair

has been loved off, and your eyes drop

out and you get loose in the joints and

very shabby.  But these things don't

matter at all, because once you are Real

you can't be ugly, except to people who

don't understand."

JOEL

(screaming)

No!  Jesus, No!

JOEL (CONT'D)

Please!  Please!  I've changed my mind!

(looks down at fading

Clementine, then at ceiling)

I don't want this.  Wake me up!  Stop the

procedure!  Plea --

MARY

It's amazing, isn't it?  Such a gift

Howard gave the world.

STAN

(a sigh)

Yeah.

MARY

To let people begin again.  It's

beautiful.  You look at a baby and it's

so fresh, so clean, so free.  And

adults... they're like this messy tangle

of anger and phobias and sadness...

hopelessness.  And Howard just makes it

go away.

STAN

You love him, don't you?

MARY

No.

(beat)

Besides, Howard's married, Stan.  He's a

very serious and ethical man.  I'm not

going to tempt him to betray all he

believes in.

PATRICK

Oh, baby, what's going on?

CLEMENTINE

I don't know.  I'm lost.  I'm scared.  I

feel like I'm disappearing.  I'm getting

old and nothing makes any sense to me.

PATRICK

Oh, Tangerine.

CLEMENTINE

Nothing makes any sense.  Nothing makes

any sense.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Come up to Boston with me?

PATRICK

Sure.  We'll go next weekend and --

CLEMENTINE

Now.  Now!  I have to go now.  I have to

see the frozen Charles!  Now!  Tonight!

PATRICK

Um, okay.  I'll call my study partner.

CLEMENTINE

Yay!  It'll be great!  I'll get my shit.

JOEL'S VOICE

Hi, it's Joel.  Please leave a message

after the beep.

PATRICK

(whisper)

Stan, it's Patrick.  Pick up.

STAN'S VOICE

Hey, where are you?

PATRICK

I got into a situation with the old lady.

Can you handle things tonight alone?  I'm

really sorry, man.

STAN

I can handle it.  He's pretty much on

auto-pilot anyway.

PATRICK

Thanks, Stan.  I owe you.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

I took Joel to walk on Charles River with

me last night.  It was so beautiful and

charming.  Joel was nervous about

stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to

please me so much -- he's so sweet --

that he came out after me.    We lay down

right in the center and watched the

stars.  He took my hand and said "I

could...

JOEL

...die right now, Clem.  I'm just...

happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm

just exactly where I want to be.

JOEL (CONT'D)

Clem, no!  This can't keep happening.

Please!  Oh, fuck!  Please!

MIERZWIAK

We can help you through this.  Why don't

you start now by telling me everything

you can remember about --

JOEL

You have to stop this!

MIERZWIAK

What?  What do you mean?

JOEL

I'm trapped in my head and everything I

love is being erased!  Stop it now!

MIERZWIAK

Yes, but... I'm just something you're

imagining.  What can I do?  I'm in your

head, too.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

... and we made love right on the ice.

It was absolutely freezing on my ass!  It

was wonderful.

CLEMENTINE

I'm so excited.  Yay!

PATRICK

I'm excited, too.  Oh, and I wanted to

give you this.  It's a little... thing.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

I didn't have a chance to wrap it.

CLEMENTINE

It's gorgeous.

(slipping it on)

Just my taste.  I've never  gone out with

a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I

liked.

(kisses him)

Thanks.  So let's get going.  Long drive.

CLEMENTINE

Such a beautiful view.

JOEL

(looking at her)

Yes indeed.

(snapping out of memory)

Fuck!  They're erasing you, Clem!

CLEMENTINE

Oh?

JOEL

I hired them to.  We're in my brain.  But

I want it to stop, before I wake up and

don't know you anymore.

CLEMENTINE

Wow.  Um, well... can't you just force

yourself awake?

JOEL

I don't know.

JOEL (CONT'D)

Aaargh!  It's horrible!  I'm trapped!

VOICE-OVER

She's so sexy.

JOEL

I loved you on this day.  I love this

memory.  The rain.  Us just hanging.

CLEMENTINE

What if you hide me?

JOEL

What do you mean?

CLEMENTINE

(formulating)

Well... if they're looking for me in

memories I'm in, what if you take me to a

memory I'm not in?

(proud)

And we can hide there till morning.

JOEL

Where?  Where?  Where?

CLEMENTINE

Jesus.  What's this?

JOEL

I must be about two.

(oddly)

I want my mommy.  She's busy.  She's not

looking at me.

(back to himself, re: doll)

Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll!  I told

you about this!

(beat)

I want my mommy!

JOEL (CONT'D)

(crying still)

I want my mommy.

(adult, to Clementine)

I don't want to lose you, Clem.

CLEMENTINE

I'm right here.

JOEL

I'm scared.  I want my mommy.  I don't

want to lose you.  I don't want to

lose...

CLEMENTINE

Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading.

The memory.  I think we're hidden.

STAN

It's stopped.

MARY

What?

STAN

Listen, it's not erasing.

STAN (CONT'D)

It's not erasing.  He's off the screen.

MARY

Where?

STAN

I don't know.  He's not on the map.

STAN (CONT'D)

I don't know what to do!  I don't know

what to do!  Crap.  Crap...

MARY

Well, what should we do?

STAN

I don't know!  I just said that!

MARY

Sor-ry

(beat)

We have to do something.  He can't wake

up half done.

STAN

Shit!

MARY

(definitely)

We should call Howard.

STAN

No way.  I can handle this.

MARY

This guy's only half cooked.  There's no

time to fuck around, Stan.

STAN

(without making eye contact)

Okay.

STAN (CONT'D)

Hello, Howard?

MIERZWIAK

Stan?  What's going on?

STAN'S VOICE

The guy we're doing?  He's disappeared

from the map.  I can't find him anywhere.

MIERZWIAK

Okay, what happened right before he

disappeared?

STAN'S VOICE

I was away from the monitor for a second.

I had it on automatic.  I had to go pee.

MIERZWIAK

Well, where was Patrick?

STAN'S VOICE

He went home sick.

MIERZWIAK

Jesus.  All right, what's the address.

STAN'S VOICE

1062 Sherman Drive.  Apartment 1E,

Rockville Center.

MARY

He's coming?

STAN

You better go.

MARY

Hell no.

MARY (CONT'D)

Shit, I'm so stoned.  I don't want him to

see me stoned.  Stop being stoned, Mary!

MARY (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)

God, I look like shit!  God!

MOTHER

How's my baby boy?

JOEL

I really want her to pick me up.  It's

weird how strong that desire is.

CLEMENTINE

You know, we're okay.  They're not

finding us.  You'll remember me in the

morning.  And you'll come to me and tell

me about us and we'll start over.

JOEL

I loved you so much this day.  On my bed

in your panties.  I remember I thought,

how impossibly lucky am I to have you on

my bed in your panties.

CLEMENTINE

You remember what happened next?

JOEL

I came over to the bed and you smelled so

good, like you just woke up, slightly

sweaty.  And I climbed on the bed with

you and you said something like --

CLEMENTINE

-- another rainy day.  Whatever shall we

do?

JOEL

There's this guy!

CLEMENTINE

What?

JOEL

There's this guy.  I heard him talking in

my apartment.  He's one of the eraser

guys.  And he fell for you when they were

erasing you, so he introduced himself the

next day as if he were a stranger and now

you're dating him.

CLEMENTINE

Really?  Is he cute?

JOEL

He stole a pair of your panties while you

were being erased!

CLEMENTINE

Gross! You must remember to tell me this

in the morning.  I'm, like, so freaked

out now.

CLEMENTINE

What's wrong with me?

PATRICK

Nothing is wrong with you.  You're the

most wonderful person I've ever met.

MARY

There he is.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Do

I look okay?

MARY (CONT'D)

I'm still stoned.  Are you?  Crap.

MARY (CONT'D)

(to Joel)

Your Visine didn't do shit, fella.

MIERZWIAK

Mary.  What are you doing here?

STAN

She came to help, Howard.

MARY

I wanted to learn as much about the

procedure as possible, Howard.  I think

it's important for my job...to help

comfort the clientele.  You know.

MIERZWIAK

Let's get to the bottom of this.  Shall

we?

MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)

Odd.

STAN

I tried that already.

MIERZWIAK

Did you try going through C-Gate?

STAN

Yeah.  Of course.

MIERZWIAK

I'm going to do a Spectrum search

throughout his memory, see if anything

comes up.

MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)

Okay, here it is.  I don't know why it's

off the map like that, but --

MOTHER

Little baby getting awwwl cleean.  Awl

clean.

JOEL

(to Clementine)

I love getting bathed in the sink.  It's

such a feeling of security.

CLEMENTINE

(giggling)

I've never seen you happier.

MIERZWIAK

Okay, we're back in.

MARY

That was beautiful to watch, Howard.

Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

MIERZWIAK

Well, thank you, Mary.

STAN

(sighing)

You get some sleep, Howard.  I'll take it

from here.

MIERZWIAK

Yeah, probably a good idea.

CLEMENTINE

But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.

JOEL

Don't call me Antoine.  My name is Wally.

CLEMENTINE

Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.

JOEL

They found us before.  The plan didn't

work.  I don't know what to do now.

CLEMENTINE

(mouthing to woman on screen)

Hide me somewhere deeper?  Somewhere

buried?

STAN

Howard, they've disappeared again.

MIERZWIAK

Oh dear.

MARY

I'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired.

CLEMENTINE

Look at you, cutey!  What are we doing?

JOEL

This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the

shit out of me.

VOICE-OVER

I'm terrified.  I thought if I hung

around the art room long enough, he'd go

home and I could get my bike.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Poor Joel.

JOE EARLY

Hi, Jill.

JOEL

He calls me Jill.  Everyone calls me Jill

after this.

JOEL

Just shut up, Joe.  I'm going home.

JOE EARLY

I don't think so.  We're fighting.

JOEL

I don't want to fight you.

JOE EARLY

C'mon, Jill.  Get up, faggot.  C'mon.

JOEL

I'm too scared to even throw a punch.

When I tell people this story I leave

that part out.

MIERZWIAK

We got him back.  Stan, I think I'm just

going to have to get through this

manually.  We're running late.

CLEMENTINE

Our house!  Our house!

JOEL

Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you.

Remember?

CLEMENTINE

(mock offended)

Joel!

JOEL

(continuing to masturbate)

I don't like it either, but I'm just

trying to find horrible secret place to --

MOTHER

Joel, I was just --

(sees what's going on)

Oh.  Um... I'll ask you in the morning,

honey.  Have a good night.

JOEL

Happy Birthday.

CLEMENTINE

(unwrapping the gift)

Thanks, Joely.  A present!  Oh boy!

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Oh, Joel.  It's beautiful!

(slip it on)

I mean, you're the first guy who ever

bought me a piece of jewelry I could

honestly say that about.

JOEL

I scoured the city for it.

CLEMENTINE

I love it!

BOYS

C'mon, Joel, you have to.  Do it already.

JOEL

I can't.  I have to go home.  I'll do it

later.

VOICE-OVER

I didn't want to do this.  But I had to

or they would've called me a girl.

VOICE-OVER

I can't believe I did that.  I'm so

ashamed.

CLEMENTINE

It's okay.  You were a little kid.

(beat)

This is a great birthday present.

Getting to see you as a boy.

JOEL

(pointing)

That's where I live.  Lived.

MIERZWIAK

I'm getting the hang of it.  I still

understand it.  But I'm finding him

quickly enough.  I'm hopeful there won't

be too much peripheral eradication.

MARY

(a little giggly)

I like watching you work.

STAN

I'll go out for a smoke.  If no one

minds.

MIERZWIAK

(not looking up)

That's fine, Stan.

MARY

Do you like quotes, Howard?

MIERZWIAK

How do you mean?

MARY

Oh, um, like famous quotes.  I find

reading them inspirational to me.  And in

my reading I've come across some I

thought you might like, too.

MIERZWIAK

Oh.  Well, I'd love to hear some.

MARY

Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed

are the forgetful, for they get the

better even of their blunders."

MIERZWIAK

Is that Nietzsche?

MARY

Yeah, yeah it is, Howard.  And here I was

thinking I could tell you something you

didn't know.

MIERZWIAK

It's a good quote, Mary.  I'm glad we

both know it.

MARY

(sputtering)

There's another one I like, I read.  It's

by Pope Alexander.

MIERZWIAK

Alexander Pope?

MARY

Yes, shit.  Oops, sorry!

(puts hand over mouth)

Sorry.  It's just I told myself I wasn't

going to say Pope Alexander and sound

like a dope and then I go ahead and do

it.  Like I psyched myself out.

MIERZWIAK

It's no big deal.

MARY

You are such a sweetheart.

MARY (CONT'D)

Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the

blameless Vestal's lot!  The world

forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal

sunshine of the spotless mind!  Each

prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".

MIERZWIAK

That's lovely.

MARY

Really?  I thought it was appropriate

maybe.  That's all.

(beat, then quickly)

I really admire the work that you do.  I

know it's not proper to be so familiar

but I guess since we're outside the

workplace I feel a certain liberty to --

MIERZWIAK

It's fine, Mary.  I'm happy to hear it.

MARY

Okay.  Good.  Great.  Thanks.

(blurting)

I like you, Howard... an awful lot.  Is

that terrible?

MIERZWIAK

You're a wonderful girl, Mary.

MARY

I've loved you for a very long time.  I'm

sorry!  I shouldn't have said that.

MIERZWIAK

I've got a wife, Mary.  Kids.  You know

that.

MARY

(suddenly weepy)

I wish I was your wife.  I wish I had

your kids.

MIERZWIAK

We can't do this.

MARY

No you're right.  Once again.  You're a

decent man, Howard.

MIERZWIAK

I want you to know it's not because I'm

not interested.  If that means anything.

MARY

What?

MARY (CONT'D)

Oh my God!

MIERZWIAK

Hollis!  Hollis!

HOLLIS (THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)

I knew it, Howard.  I don't even know why

I bothered to copy the damn address.

MIERZWIAK

It didn't start out to be this.  I came

here to work.  It's a one-time mistake.

MARY

(heroically)

Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true.  And it's not

Mr. Mierzwiak's fault.  I'm a stupid

little girl with a stupid little crush.

I basically forced him into it.  I swear.

HOLLIS

Don't be a monster, Howard.  Tell the

girl.

MARY

Tell me what?

HOLLIS

Poor kid.  You can have him.  You did.

MARY

What, Howard?

MIERZWIAK

We... have a history.  I'm sorry.  You

wanted the procedure.  You wanted it

done... to get past.  I have to finish in

there.  It's almost morning.  We'll talk

later.

STAN

Let me take you home.

PATRICK

I could die right now, Clem.  I'm just

happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm

just exactly where I want to be.

CLEMENTINE

I want to go home.

CLEMENTINE

I love this book, Joel.  Thank you so

much for telling me about it.

FATHER

Don't be like me, son.  Don't waste your

life.  You'll come to a point someday

where it'll be too late.  You'll be sewn

into your fate...

JOEL

It was horrifying, seeing my father like

that.

There was no hope for me if his life was

such a failure.  And he saw failure in

me, too, written in my future.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Joel, you're not sewn in.  He's wrong.

FATHER

...and there'll be nowhere to go except

where you're headed, like a train on a

track.  Inevitable, unalterable.

JOEL

I'm done, Clem.  I'm just going to ride

it out.  Hiding is clearly not working.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah.

JOEL

I want to enjoy my little time left with

you.

CLEMENTINE

This is our first "date" date.

JOEL

Do you remember what we talked about?

CLEMENTINE

Naomi, I guess.

JOEL

Yeah.

CLEMENTINE

What was I wearing?

JOEL

God, I should know.  Your hair was red.

I remember it matched the wallpaper.

CLEMENTINE

Egad, were you horrified?

JOEL

No!  I think you were wearing that black

dress, y'know, with the buttons.

CLEMENTINE

No, you were with me when I bought that.

At that place on East 6th.  It was later.

JOEL

Right.  Something black though.

CLEMENTINE

I'll buy that.  Black's always good.

JOEL

We did talk about Naomi.

CLEMENTINE

I said: Are you sure?  You seem unsure.

JOEL

I'm sure, I said.

CLEMENTINE

But you weren't.  I could tell.

JOEL

I was so nervous.  I remember I couldn't

think of anything to say.  There were

long silences.

JOEL (CONT'D)

I thought I was foolish.  I thought I'd

mistaken infatuation for love.  You said:

CLEMENTINE

So what.  Infatuation is good, too.

JOEL

And I didn't have an argument.

JOEL

I dropped you off after.  You said --

CLEMENTINE

(Mae West)

Come up and see me... now.

JOEL

It's very late.

CLEMENTINE

Yes, exactly.  Exactly my point.

JOEL

This was our first time.

MIERZWIAK VOICE

Okay, so just tell me what you remember.

And we'll take it from there.

MARY'S VOICE

(shaky)

Um, I liked you immediately.  At the job

interview.  You seemed so... important

and mature.  And I loved that you were

helping all these people.  You didn't

come on to me at all.  I liked that.  I

was tongue-tied around you at first.  I

wanted you to think I was smart.  You

were so nice.  I loved the way you

smelled.  I couldn't wait to come to

work.  I had these fantasies of us being

married and having kids and just...

(starts to cry)

...and so... then... when...

that one day, when I thought you looked

at me back... like... Oh, Howie, I can't

do this?  How can I do this?

MIERZWIAK VOICE

It's what's best, Mary.  You know that.

MARY'S VOICE

Yeah, I know.  Oh, God.  Okay, well, I

was so excited...

MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)

...Remember you bought me that little

wind-up frog?

MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)

And you said...

MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)

"This is for your desk.  Just a little

token"

MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)

I knew then... I knew something was going

to happen... something wonderful.

JOEL

Naomi.

VOICE-OVER

On the couch.  Dark.  Quiet.  I wondered

if I had made a terrible mistake.  I

almost reached for the phone about a

thousand times.  I thought I could take

it back, erase it, explain I had

momentarily lost my mind. Then I told

myself we weren't happy.  That was the

truth.  That what we were was safe.

It was unfair to you and to me to stay in

a relationship for that reason.  I

thought about Clementine and the spark

when I was with her, but then I thought

what you and I had was real and adult and

therefore significant even if it wasn't

much fun.   But I wanted fun.  I saw

other people having fun and I wanted it.

Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one

is really having fun; I'm being suckered

by advertising and movie bullshit... then

I thought maybe not, maybe not.  And then

I thought, as I always do at this point

in my argument, about dying.

VOICE-OVER

I projected myself to the end of my life

in some vague rendition of my old man

self.  I imagined looking back with a

tremendous hole of regret in my heart.

VOICE-OVER

I didn't pick up the phone to call you,

Naomi.  I didn't pick up the phone.

NAOMI

Yours?

JOEL

You take it.  I don't know.

JOEL (CONT'D)

Naomi, I really value our relationship.

I hope it's possible for us to stay in

touch.

NAOMI

Don't do this to me now, Joel.  Really.

JOEL

I told her today I need to end it.

CLEMENTINE

Is that what you want?

JOEL

I did it.  I guess that means something.

NAOMI

So what's going on, Joel?

JOEL

I don't know, I've just been thinking,

maybe we're not happy with each other.

NAOMI

What?

JOEL

Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort

of, unhappy with each other and --

NAOMI

Don't say "we" when you mean "you."

JOEL

I think maybe, we're both so used to

operating at this level that -- How can

one person be unhappy?  If one person is

unhappy, both have to be... by

definition.

NAOMI

Bullshit.  Who is it?  You met someone.

JOEL

No.  I just need some space, maybe.

NAOMI

The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you

think you have with this chick, once the

thrill wears off, you're just going to be

Joel with the same fucking problems.

JOEL

It's not somebody else.

VOICE-OVER

I hate myself.

JOEL

Is there a Clementine who works here?

MALE EMPLOYEE #1

(calling to another male

employee)

Mark, is Clem on tonight?

MALE EMPLOYEE #2

On my dick, bro.

(turns, sese Joel, embarrassed)

Oh, hey.  Yeah, I think she's upstairs in

Philosophy.

JOEL

Hi.

CLEMENTINE

I didn't think you'd show your face

around me again.  I figured you were

humiliated.  You did run away, after all.

JOEL

Sorry to track you down like this.  I'm

not a stalker.  But I needed to see you.

CLEMENTINE

(seemingly uninterested)

Yeah?

JOEL

I'd like to... take you out or something.

CLEMENTINE

Well, you're married.

JOEL

Not yet.  Not married.

CLEMENTINE

Look, man, I'm telling you right off the

bat, I'm high maintenance.  So I'm not

going to tiptoe around your marriage or

whatever it is you got going there.  If

you want to be with me, you're with me.

JOEL

Okay.

CLEMENTINE

So make your domestic decisions and maybe

we'll talk again.

JOEL

I just think that you have some kind

of... quality that seems really important

to me.

CLEMENTINE

Joel, I'm not a concept.  I want you to

just keep that in your head.  Too many

guys think I'm a concept or I complete

them or I'm going to make them alive, but

I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking

for my own peace of mind.  Don't assign

me yours.

JOEL

I remember that speech really well.

CLEMENTINE

(smiling)

I had you pegged, didn't I?

JOEL

You had the whole human race pegged.

CLEMENTINE

Probably.

JOEL

I still thought you were going to save

me.  Even after that.

CLEMENTINE

I know.

JOEL

It would be different, if we could just

give it another go around.

CLEMENTINE

Remember me.  Try your best.  Maybe we

can.

JOEL

Thanks, guys.

CARRIE

I hope you feel better, sweetie.

JOEL

Yeah.

CARRIE

Say hi to Naomi.

VOICE-OVER

I hope she's not up.  I need to think.

VOICE-OVER

I met someone tonight at a party on the

beach.  Her name is Clementine.  There is

something alive about her.

NAOMI

(full of sleep)

Hi.

JOEL

Hi.

NAOMI

How was it?

JOEL

You didn't miss much.  Rob Carrie say

hello.

NAOMI

Hi, Rob and Carrie.

JOEL

Go back to sleep.

NAOMI

Yeah.  Come to bed.  I'm cold.

JOEL

In a minute.

VOICE-OVER

(more and more emotionless)

I don't know what to do about this.  I've

been feeling so alienated and numb

lately.  Forever.  The thought of not

acknowledging my feelings again seems

self-destructive.

How can I continue on this path toward a

living death, a life filled with

obligation and guilt and responsibility

but joyless, hopeless?  I need to speak

with Clementine.

JOEL

So you don't mind?

NAOMI

I've got to finish this chapter anyway.

JOEL

Okay.  I wish you could come.

VOICE-OVER

This is it.  The night we met.  My God,

it's over.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Me, too.

NAOMI (CONT'D)

Say hi to Rob and Carrie.  Have some fun!

JOEL

I hope you get your work done.

NAOMI

(sighing)

Yeah.

CARRIE

I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it.  You

okay?  You seem quiet.

JOEL

Just a little overworked, maybe.

VOICE-OVER

The trip to the party where I met

Clementine.  My first memory of her is

now my last memory of her.

JOEL

I remember you turned around.  Your face

was dark and your hair was backlit -- I

could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me

if things were okay between Naomi and me.

CARRIE

I did.  You said, things were fine.

JOEL

I remember.

CARRIE

This is the night you met Clementine,

Joel.  I remember watching you walk down

the beach with her and I thought, oh

shit.

JOEL

Yeah, you told me that later.

CARRIE

I told you that later.

CARRIE

Who was the girl you walked off with?

JOEL

No one.

CARRIE

Is this the right way?

JOEL

You were down by the surf.  I could just

make you out in the dark.

JOEL (CONT'D)

Your back to me.  In that orange

sweatshirt I would come to know so well

and even hate eventually.  At the time I

thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

VOICE-OVER

I remember being drawn to you even then.

I thought, I love this woman because

she's alone down there looking out at the

black ocean.

JOEL (CONT'D)

But I went back to my food.  The next

thing I remember, I felt someone sitting

next to me and I saw the orange sleeve

out of the corner of my eye.

CLEMENTINE

Hi there.

JOEL

Hi.

VOICE-OVER

I was so nervous.  What were you doing

there, I wondered.  Your hair was lime

green.  Green revolution.

JOEL

You said...

CLEMENTINE

I saw you sitting over here.  By

yourself.  I thought, thank God, someone

normal, who doesn't know how interact at

these things either.

JOEL

Yeah.  I don't ever know what to say.

CLEMENTINE

I can't tell you how happy I am to hear

that.  I mean, I don't mean I'm happy

you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm

such a loser.  Every time I come to a

party I tell myself I'm going to be

different and it's always exactly the

same and then I hate myself after for

being such a clod.

JOEL

Even then I didn't believe you entirely.

I thought how could you be talking to me

if you couldn't talk to people?

VOICE-OVER

But I thought, I don't know, I thought it

was cool that you were sensitive enough

to know what I was feeling and that you

were attracted to it.

CLEMENTINE

But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal

ones, y'know?  I mean, what kind of

people do well at this stuff?

VOICE-OVER

And I just liked you so much.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

You did?  You liked me?

JOEL

You know what I did.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah, I know.  I'm fishing.

JOEL

You said --

CLEMENTINE

I'm Clementine.  Can I borrow a piece of

your chicken?

JOEL

And you picked it out of my plate before

I could answer and it felt so intimate

like we were already lovers.

JOEL (CONT'D)

I remember --

VOICE-OVER

The grease on your chin in the bonfire

light.

CLEMENTINE

Oh God, how horrid.

JOEL

I'm Joel.

VOICE-OVER

No, it was lovely.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Hi, Joel.  So no jokes about my name?

JOEL

You mean, like...

(singing)

Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my

darlin', Clementine... ?  Huckleberry

Hound?  That sort of thing?

CLEMENTINE

Yeah, like that.

JOEL

Nope.  No jokes.  My favorite thing when

I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound

doll.  I think your name is magic.

CLEMENTINE

(eyes welling)

This is it, Joel.  It's gonna be gone

soon.

JOEL

I know.

CLEMENTINE

What do we do?

JOEL

Enjoy it.  Say good-bye.

JOEL (CONT'D)

So you're still on the Zoloft?

VOICE-OVER

Next thing I remember we were walking

down near the surf.

CLEMENTINE

No, I stopped.  I didn't want to feel

like I was being artificially modulated.

JOEL

I know what you mean.  That's why I

stopped.

CLEMENTINE

But my sleeping is really fucked up.

JOEL

I don't think I've slept in a year.

CLEMENTINE

You should try Xanax.  I mean, it's a

chemical and all, but it works... and it

works just having it around, knowing that

it's there.  Like insurance.

JOEL

yeah?

CLEMENTINE

I'll give you a couple.  See what you

think.

JOEL

Okay.

CLEMENTINE

Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?

JOEL

I love her.

CLEMENTINE

Really?  Me, too!  I don't meet people

who even know who she is and I work in a

book store.

JOEL

I think she's great.

CLEMENTINE

Me too.  There's this poem --

JOEL

Did this conversation come before or

after we saw the house?

CLEMENTINE

I think, before.

JOEL

Seems too coincidental that way.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah, maybe.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside

gusts of wind,/And a house in which we

don't live...

JOEL

Yeah, yeah.  It goes "Perhaps there is

someone in this world to whom I could

send all these lines"?

CLEMENTINE

Yes!  I love that poem.  It breaks my

heart.  I'm so excited you know it.

(pointing to houses)

Look, houses in which we don't live.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

I wish we did.  You married?

JOEL

Um, no.

CLEMENTINE

Let's move into this neighborhood.

JOEL

I do sort of live with somebody though.

CLEMENTINE

Oh.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Male or female?

JOEL

Female.

CLEMENTINE

At least I haven't been barking up the

wrong tree.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Cool.

JOEL

What are you doing?

CLEMENTINE

It's freezing out here.

JOEL

(whisper)

Clementine.

VOICE-OVER

I couldn't believe you did that.  I was

paralyzed with fear.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

C'mon, man.  The water's fine.  Nobody's

coming here tonight, believe me.  This

place is closed up.  Electricity's off.

JOEL

I hesitated for what seemed like forever.

CLEMENTINE

I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

As soon as you walked in.  I knew I had

you.  You knew I knew that, right?

JOEL

I knew.

CLEMENTINE

I knew by your nervousness that Naomi

wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to

criminally trespass.

JOEL

It's dark.

CLEMENTINE

Yeah.  What's your girlfriend's name?

JOEL

Naomi.

CLEMENTINE

Ah-ha!  Now I can look for candles,

matches, and the liquor cabinet.

JOEL

I think we should go.

CLEMENTINE

No, it's our house!  Just tonight --

(looking at envelope on

counter)

-- we're David and Ruth Laskin.  Which

one do you want to be?  I prefer to be

Ruth but I'm flexible.

(opens cabinet)

Alcohol!  You make drinks.  I'm going

find the bedroom and slip into something

more Ruth.  I'm ruthless at the moment.

JOEL

(calling after her)

I really should go.  I really need to

catch my ride.

VOICE-OVER

I didn't want to go.  I was too nervous.

I thought, maybe you were a nut.  But you

were exciting.  You called from upstairs.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

(flat)

So go.

JOEL

I did.  I walked out the door.  I felt

like I was a scared little kid.  I

thought you knew that about me.  I ran

back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my

humiliation.  You said, "so go" with such

disdain.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

(poking her head downstairs)

What if you stay this time?

JOEL

I walked out the door.  There's no more

memory.

CLEMENTINE

Come back and make up a good-bye at

least.  Let's pretend we had one.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Bye, Joel.

JOEL

I love you.

CLEMENTINE

I --

CARRIE

Did you have fun?

HOWARD

Okay.

HOLLIS'S VOICE

Hi, you've reached the Mierzwiaks.  We

can't come to --

STAN

So, I've got to drop the van off.

MIERZWIAK

Thanks, Stan.  Thanks.

PATRICK

You want to stop for coffee or something?

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Well, it was sure beautiful on that

river.  Thanks for sharing it with me.

PATRICK (CONT'D)

Well do it again soon.

STAN

Hey.

MARY

(beat)

Do you swear you didn't know?

STAN

I swear.

MARY

And you never even suspected?  Never saw

us behaving in any unusual way together?

STAN

Once, maybe.

STAN (CONT'D)

It was here.  At his car.  I was coming

back from a job and spotted you together.

You seemed caught.  I waved.  You

giggled.

MARY

How did I look?

STAN

(beat)

Happy.  Happy with a secret.

MARY

And after that?

STAN

I never saw you together like that again.

So I figured I was imagining things.

STAN (CONT'D)

I really like you, Mary.  You know that.

MARY

Do you remember anything else?  What I

was wearing?  Was I standing close to

him?  Was I leaning against his car like

I owned it?  How did he look at me when I

giggled?  Tell me everything.

STAN

(thinking)

You were in red.  That red sweater with

the little flowers, I think.  You were

leaning against his car.

(thinking)

He looked a little like a kid.  Kind of

goofy and wide-eyed.  I'd never seen him

look like that before.  Happy.  You

looked beautiful.  You looked in love.

MARY

(heading toward the levator)

Thanks, Stan.

MARY (CONT'D)

You're nice.

(beat)

But I love him.  I knew I loved him.  Now

I know.

JOEL

Hi... Naomi?  Yeah, hi!  How are you?  I

know, I know.  It's been a long time.

Not too much.  You?  Oh, that's great!

Congratulations!  Maybe I could buy you

dinner to celebrate?  Tonight?  I'm free.

Okay, good!

MARY

I need this signed, Howard.

MARY (CONT'D)

Thanks.

(beat)

So... do we talk about this... or what?

MIERZWIAK

I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary.

I want to do the right thing here.

MARY

Do you love me?  Did you love me?

Something.  I listened to my tape.  I

can't believe I've been sitting right in

front of it for a year.  It's like

listening to someone else's story.  I

mean, I hear myself talking about having

sex with you and I can't even imagine you

naked.  I can't even say "naked" to you!

MIERZWIAK

I have a family, Mary.

MARY

You made me have an abortion.

MIERZWIAK

It was a mutual decision.

MARY

You made me have you erased!  I loved

you.  I love you!  How could you --

MIERZWIAK

I didn't make you.  You thought it best.

(off her stare)

But, look, I take full responsibility.

NAOMI

(oddly cautious)

So... you haven't been involved with

anyone in all this time?

JOEL

It's been a pretty lonely couple of

years.

NAOMI

I'm sorry.

JOEL

Well, it was my fault -- the break-up.

I'm sorry.

NAOMI

Oh, sweetie.  It really does cut both

ways.  We were taking each other for

granted and --

JOEL

I miss you.

NAOMI

Miss you, too.

(awkward pause)

I have been seeing someone for a little

while.

JOEL

(trying for enthusiasm)

Oh!  Great.  That's great!

NAOMI

A religion instructor at Columbia.  A

good guy.  He's a good guy.

JOEL

I'm sorry.  I really shouldn't have --

NAOMI

I'm glad you called.

JOEL

So you think the dissertation will get

published?

NAOMI

I don;t know.  I'm not sure there's a big

public demand for books on Calvinism and

Misogyny.

CLEMENTINE

So you'll call me, right?

JOEL

Yeah.

CLEMENTINE

When?

JOEL

Tomorrow?

CLEMENTINE

Tonight.  Just to test out the phone

lines.

JOEL

Yeah.

JOEL

Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.

NAOMI'S VOICE

Hi.

JOEL

How's it going?

NAOMI'S VOICE

Good.  I called you at work today.  They

said you were home sick.

JOEL

I know.  I had to take the day to think.

NAOMI'S VOICE

Yeah, I tried you at home.  Did you get

my message?

JOEL

I just got in.

NAOMI'S VOICE

Long day thinking.

JOEL

Yeah, I suppose so.

NAOMI ON MACHINE

(cheerful)

Hi.  They told me you were sick!  So...

Where are you?!  I had a really nice time

last night.  Just wanted to say hi, so...

hi.  Call me.  I'm home.  Call me!

NAOMI'S VOICE

That's me.

JOEL

There you are.

(pause)

Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall

back into this fast without considering

the problems we had...

NAOMI

Okay, Joel.  I suppose you're right.

JOEL

I had a good time last night.  I really

did.

NAOMI

So I'm going to get some sleep.  I'm glad

you're okay.

JOEL

We'll speak soon.

NAOMI

'Night.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

What took you so long?

JOEL

I just walked in.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

Hmmm.  Do you miss me?

JOEL

Oddly enough, I do.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

Ha Ha!  You said, I do.  I guess that

means we're married.

JOEL

I guess so.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.

CLEMENTINE

Don't worry.  It's really solid this time

of year.

JOEL

I don't know.

JOEL (CONT'D)

This is so beautiful.

CLEMENTINE

Isn't it?

JOEL

I don't know.  What if it breaks?

CLEMENTINE

What if?

JOEL

I think I should go back.

CLEMENTINE

Joel, come here.  Please.

JOEL

Listen, did you want to make love?

CLEMENTINE

Make love?

JOEL

Have sex.  Y'know --

CLEMENTINE

Oh, um...

JOEL

Because I just am not drunk enough or

stoned enough to make that happen right

now.

CLEMENTINE

That's okay.  I --

JOEL

I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say that.

This seems like the perfect romantic

exotic place to do it and --

CLEMENTINE

Hey, Joel --

JOEL

-- and I'm just too nervous around you

right now.

CLEMENTINE

I'm nervous, too.

JOEL

Yeah?  I wouldn't have thought that.

CLEMENTINE

Well, you obviously don't know me.

JOEL

I'm nervous because I have and enormous

crush on you.

CLEMENTINE

Show me which constellations you know.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

Yeah?

JOEL

Did you send this?  Is it a joke?

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

I probably got the same thing as you.

JOEL

I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've

met you.  Who would even know to do this?

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

(matter of fact)

Maybe it's true then.  It's my voice on

the tape.

JOEL

That's what you have to say?  How could

it be true?  I never even heard of any

procedure like this.  It's a joke.

CLEMENTINE

Maybe.  Call someone who'd know.

CARRIE

Yes, Joel.  It is true.  We weren't

supposed to say anything.  They say it's

like waking a sleepwalker.

JOEL

It's true.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

I know.  I spoke to my friend Magda.

JOEL

Look, I have to go.  I have to think.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

Joel, we've fucked.  We've made love.

Like a million times.  And we were so

sweet and shy and inept with each other

last night.  Isn't that lovely?

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Come over here, sweetheart.  Please.

CLEMENTINE

Says you were closed off, non

communicative, never told me what you

were feeling.

JOEL

Says you were a bully...

CLEMENTINE

(laughing)

A bully?  Moi?

JOEL

That's what it says.  You drank too much,

you picked on me for being passive and

timid.

CLEMENTINE

Well, sounds like me.  Sorry, man.

(reading)

Says you were jealous and suspicious.

JOEL

Says you would sometimes disappear all

night, then brag to me about your sexual

conquests.

CLEMENTINE

Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or

is that your way of putting it.

JOEL

I don't know.

CLEMENTINE

Doesn't sound like me.

JOEL

Says you were a slob, leaving trails of

panties and dirty socks in your wake.

CLEMENTINE

Says you were constantly calling me a

slob.

(laughs)

It's sexy that we were like a married

couple, griping and overly-familiar and

bored.  Don't you think?

JOEL

(considering)

I sort of do.  But I only see it as a

fantasy version of reality.  Cleaned up

enough to be erotic.

CLEMENTINE

We should have sex.  It's old hat for us.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

You know my body like the back of your

hand.

CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)

Every curve, every freckle.

JOEL

You're so beautiful.

RECEPTIONIST

May I help you?

STAN

I work here.  I used to work here.  Stan.

Please just tell Howard I'm here to clean

out my desk.

RECEPTIONIST

(into phone)

Mr. Mierzwiak, Stan is here to -- Yes

sir.

(to Stan)

He says he needs to see you.

MIERZWIAK

She should not have done this, Stan.  As

mad as she was... as justifiably --

STAN

I don't know what you're talking about,

Howard.

MIERZWIAK

Mary has stolen our files and is sending

them back to people.

STAN

Jesus.

YOUNG WOMAN

... so I called everybody I know and

asked them to tell me everything.  Now I

know my entire history with him, but it's

in the form of a story, I'm losing my

mind.

MIERZWIAK

This is why people must never be told.

It's like waking a --

YOUNG WOMAN

I don't know what to do.  Before I

thought I was depressed for no reason.

Now it's like I've been assigned a

reason.

PATRICK

This never should've happened, ma'am.

We'll take care of it.

MIERZWIAK

I know you don't like me much, Stan, but

please talk to Mary.  She of all people

should know this is a dangerous thing

she's doing.

JOEL

Hi, it's Joel.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

Hey, lover.  Whatcha doing?

JOEL

I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I

can till I can see you.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

God, I can't believe I ever hated you.

JOEL

You must have been crazy.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

Guess what I'm wearing.

JOEL

I don't know.  Panties and --

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE

Your dried cum.

JOEL

Jesus.

CLEMENTINE

You're still excited by my irreverence.

You haven't yet started to think of it as

my "gratuitous need to shock."

JOEL

I can't stop thinking about you.

CLEMENTINE

Yay.  Meet me after work by the old mill.

JOEL

What old mill?  Is that somewhere we --

CLEMENTINE

I just wanted to say that.  Come by my

house.

MARY

Oh.

STAN

Hi.

MARY

What do you want, Stan?

STAN

Can I... I brought some --

STAN (CONT'D)

What's this?

MARY

Nothing.

STAN

I know what it is.

MARY

Then why did you ask me?

STAN

I don't know.  I just -- there are a lot

of really confused people showing up at

the office.

MARY

They have a right to know.  Howard is a

thief.  He steals the truth.

(suddenly weeping)

I can't remember my baby!  I can't

remember my baby.  It existed and I can't

even remember.  Do you understand that?

STAN

Mary, people come to him voluntarily.

MARY

I won't allow it.  Those who cannot

remember the past are condemned to repeat

it.  What do you think of that?  That's

from my quote book.

STAN

The office is filled with people who want

their memories re-erased.

MARY

(hysterically)

Remember the Alamo!  Remember the Alamo!

STAN

Mary... please.  This is hurting people.

MARY

(small)

I don't want to hurt people.

(breaking down)

But these things happened!  All these

little sadnesses, the big ones.  What if

no one remembers?  What does that do to

the world?

(beat, quietly)

Someone has to remember, Stan.

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE

I was by myself in the park because my

friend Davia was sick that day.  I was on

a swing.  There was this smiling man

walking a little bushy dog --

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

The man said something like, "He's

friendly --"

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)

"-- he won't bite."

MAN

He won't bite.  You can pet him if you

want...

MAN

Do you want to give him a biscuit?

MAN (CONT'D)

They're in my car.  Why don't you --

DISTRAUGHT WOMAN'S VOICE

Excuse me?  Hello?

MARY

May I help you?

DISTRAUGHT WOMAN

I'm here for Dr. Mierzwiak.  My name is

Helene Kernfeld.

MARY

Yes, please have a seat.  The doctor will

be with you momentarily.

MARY (CONT'D)

Howard, your 10:30.

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE

He took me to his car and ...

MAN

I...I... I... find you physically

repulsive!  I can't even look at you!

OLD MAN

How are you today, Mary?

OLD WOMAN (MARY)

Let's see... Still dying, Howard.

OLD MAN (HOWARD)

You don't have to jump down my throat.  I

was trying to be nice.

OLD WOMAN (MARY)

Well, don't try.  It's unbecoming on you.

OLD WOMAN (MARY) (CONT'D)

May I help you?

SECOND OLD WOMAN

I'd like to make an appointment.

OLD WOMAN (MARY)

I think the doctor is free this morning.

He can probably take you right away for

an initial consultation.

OLD WOMAN (MARY)

Dr. Mierzwiak, this is Clementine

Kruczynski.  She'd like to talk to you.

OLD MAN (HOWARD)

Hello, Ms. Kruczynski.  Nice to meet you.

Please have a seat.

OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)

Would you mind if I tape our discussion?

OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)

So, why don't you begin by telling me why

you've come here.

SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE)

Well, I met this man, Joel, three years

ago at a senior dance...  We'd both been

alone for so long and...

SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)

I remember Joel and I were having

breakfast --

SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)

-- I said something like we should go

upstate and see the leaves change...

SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)

(CONT'D)

He just stared at me as if I didn't

exist.  As if I had never existed...

SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)

-- his eyes used to be so filled with

love.  But it was gone.  How can I go

back to being alone after seeing love?  I

was alone for so long.  What had I done

with my life?  I was alone so long.

OLD MAN'S VOICE

Hi, it's Joel.  What's going on, Clem?

Why won't you call me back?  Please call

me.  We need to speak.
